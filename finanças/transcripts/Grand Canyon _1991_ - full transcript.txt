( crowd cheering ) Yeah! You know what your problem is? You're always talking about x, but you're thinking about Y. You've gotta learn to talk about Y. Forget about x. x is gonna take care of itself. - What are you talking about? - Just asking you to hear yourself. Listen to what you're really saying, under what you think you're saying-- control, control, control. When are you gonna realize nothing can be controlled? - We live in chaos. - ( car alarm chirps ) lt's the central issue in everyone's life. Mack, look around you. Everyone in this parking lot is struggling for control. And you know what it is they're trying to control, each and every one of 'em? Fear. They're trying to control their fear. - Thanks for the game, Davis. - Mack, you're my best friend. This is important. Let's talk tomorrow. - Good night, Mack. - Good night, Vanessa. l have more to say about this. Vanessa, why is it, when someone's successful in one field, they think they know about everything?

Oh, can you pick me up tomorrow at 4:30? 4:30 behind the school? l thought you were gonna get a ride occasionally. l try. lt's just really hard to arrange to leave at exactly the same time as someone. lt's just really hard for me to arrange my whole afternoon around picking you up. l'm working at the senior center tomorrow. lf you can't do it, l can try to find a ride. lt's kind of late, but-- Thanks.

On that phone there you called all those people? - Who else you call, your mama? - ( laughing ) - He been busy, man. - l see. You know, this is a nice car, mister. l could use me a car with a phone in it. Maybe you want us to give you a ride somewhere or something. You want a jumpstart or something? Yeah, man. How about a jumpstart? - ( thuds ) - He nervous, y'all. What you so nervous about, man? Maybe he carryin', Jim. Maybe he's scared we gonna bust him. Bust his ass. Leave that man alone! Okay, Grandma. Whatever, baby. ( sighs ) Why don't you get outta the car, mister? You want me to have Jimmy take you outta there? Or how about this? Do you ever wanna get outta that car again? Look, what do you want? You want my wallet? You want my watch? lt's a shitty watch. - You're welcome to it. - What l want is you get outta the car. Come on! Let's get this shit over with! Now, motherfucker. Which one of you called for the truck? Me. That was me. This is it. lt just sort of died on me here. l'm the one that called. Well, l guess it was you, huh? - Yeah. - Hey, man, we was doin' fine here. - ls it the battery? - Huh? Were you stopped and it wouldn't start again? No, no. lt just died on me. Driver: We're gonna have to take it in. - You dissin' me, man? - You bet he is. You're seein' it now, man. Man, that's right. That's what he's doin'. ls that right? You dissin' me? No, l'm not. Nothing like it. l'm doing a job here, fella. This is how l make my living. l just ride out there and do the job. l want it to go as smooth as it can be. l don't like it to be any harder than it already is. You wanna make sure you're in neutral and the parking brake is off? That's bullshit, man. He talkin' bullshit. Yeah, man, what's goin' down? This is fucked up. ( hydraulics hissing ) ( thuds ) Get in the truck. You'll ride up with me. Are you the one l'm talkin' to? Hey, we all decide what goes down. So don't fly that shit. Yeah, man, fuck you! Am l talking to the right man? That's what l thought. Look, l gotta ask you a favor. l gotta ask you to let me go my way here. Now, this truck is my responsibility. Now that the car's hooked up to it, l'm responsible for that, too. Any shit comes down now, it's my ass. You follow me? Do you think l'm stupid? Just answer me that first and then we can talk. Look, l don't know nothing about you, you don't know nothing about me. l don't know if you're stupid or some kind of genius. But l do know this-- l gotta get out of here and you got the gun. So l'm asking you a favor for the second time. Let me go my way here. l'm gonna grant you that favor. And l'm gonna expect you to remember this if we ever meet again. Yeah. But first, you gotta answer one more thing for me, and you gotta tell me the truth. Are you asking me a favor as a sign of respect, or are you asking me a favor 'cause l got the gun? Man, the world ain't supposed to work like this. Maybe you don't know that, but this ain't the way it's supposed to be. l'm supposed to be able to do my job without asking you if l can. That dude is supposed to be able to wait with his car without you ripping him off. Everything's supposed to be different than what it is. So what's your answer? You don't have the gun, we ain't having this conversation. That's what l thought. No gun, no respect. That's why l always got the gun. ( spits ) - ( engine starts ) - ( hip hop music playing ) ( engine starts ) Thanks. You saved my ass. We both got lucky. lt could have gone different. What's going on in the world? This neighborhood has gone to shit. This country has gone to shit. My sister and her kids live near here. ( helicopter whirring ) ( TV playing ) Woman on TV: That was a joke, Frasier. Man on TV: Oh, l forgot l married a madcap. Man #2: Hey, listen, folks, nobody's really interested about your little motor trip. We're talking about my upcoming surgery. So now where was l? So you gonna see the Grand Canyon? Yeah, don't miss Yosemite. lf you go to the alligator farm outside Tallahassee, tell lvar, Woody says hey hey. Hey, Ma. Hey, baby. How you doing? Boy: l'm all right. - Woman: What time is it? - 11 :30. - What's up? - What's up-- Kelley's gonna be in the Girl Scouts next year. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. l have to get her a uniform. ( yawns ) Ooh. l'm going to bed. - Sleep tight, baby. - Good night, Ma. Woman on TV: The sooner the better. How do you think l'll do? Man: l've never had a woman in a car that didn't do great. ( switches channel ) Man on TV: There was more slow time than show time early in the season. The Lakers were simply out of sync, but a stifling defense and the return of that patented running game has catapulted LA back into serious contention now in the West. They're now just a game and a half back of the Blazers after ending Orlando's magical road run as the Magic came out hot, as they were putting up everything, and then Dennis Scott hit six straight. There's a three-pointer. Dunleavy wanted a time out. His team was down by 10. Here's Earvin Johnson missing the lay up. Divac can't jam it back. Magic breaking out of there. This is Sam Vincent of Orlando. Three on one. The lceman. Jerry Reynolds stuffing over Teagle. Matt Guokas has done a great job lately for Orlando. - ( telephone rings ) - Hello. - Hello. - Mack: Hi, guys. - Mack, what's wrong? - Nothing, l'm fine. - The car died on me. - Boy: Where? - Down near the Forum. - Boy: Oh, shit. - Roberto. - Roberto: On Manchester? No, no. Like an idiot, l took a shortcut and got all turned around. You've never been where l broke down. Roberto: Shit! Are you out of there now? - Yeah, l'm at a gas station. - Woman: Good. You're lucky you got out with your life. lt could have been curtains, Dad. Roberto, could l talk? - See you tomorrow, Dad. - Good night, pal. Do you want me to come and get you? No, no. lf they're not gonna finish it, l'll just take a cab. You go to sleep. l'll tell you all about my adventure in the morning. Adventure? Mack, what happened? - Are you all right? - l'm fine. Go to bed, honey. l love you. - Love you, too. - Bye. ( sighs ) You can go swimming in the ocean every day and be perfectly cool, you know? Then one day, just one particular day, you bump into the big shark. Now, the big shark don't hate you. He's got no feeling for you at all. You look like food to him. You don't hate a hamburger, do you, huh? Yeah. Those boys back there, they got nothing to lose. lf you just happen to be swimming along and bump into 'em, well-- lt might not be worth worrying about. lt's like being in a plane crash. That's comforting. l'm glad you brought that up. There just seems to be so many ways to buy it. Particularly in this city. l'm amazed at the end of each day that anybody's alive. Then other days l think maybe people aren't so fragile. Things have always been kind of brutal, and people just keep on going. You ever been to the Grand Canyon? - l always meant to go. - l was there. Only takes about nine hours from here. l know. We were planning to take my boy. - How old is he? - 15. 15. Probably won't wanna go with you now. Probably go with his friends and his chick now. You've missed that boat. - What's his name? - Roberto. - Roberto. - After Roberto Clemente. No shit. Man, get yourself to the Grand Canyon. - Beautiful, huh? - lt's pretty, all right. But that's not the thing of it. You can sit right on the edge of it, you know? l did that. l did everything. l went down in it. l stayed overnight there. But the thing that got me was sitting on the edge of that big old thing. Those rocks. Man, those cliffs and rocks, they're so old. lt took so long for that thing to get to look like that. And it ain't done, either. lt happens right while you're sitting there watching it. lt's happening right now while we're sitting here in this ugly town, yeah. When you sit on the edge of that thing, you just realize what a joke we people are. What big heads we got, thinking that what we do is gonna matter all that much. Thinking our time here means diddly to those rocks. lt's a split second we've been here, the whole lot of us. And one of us? That's a piece of time too small to get a name. - You trying to cheer me up? - Yeah. Those rocks were laughing at me. l could tell. Me and my worries. lt was real humorous to that Grand Canyon. You know what l felt like? l felt like a gnat that lands on the ass of a cow that's chewing its cud next to the road that you ride by on at 70 miles an hour. - That's small. - Yeah, it's small. My name is Mack. Simon. ( people clamoring ) l said left! l told you left! You scum-sucking pig! l'm sorry, mister. l must've heard you wrong. Get out of there, you piece of shit! ( screaming ) ( tires screeching ) l told you not to move! ( screams ) - Where's the shot? - Man: What shot? - You took out the shot. - Which shot is that? The money shot. The bus driver's head. The brains-on-the-window shot. The viscera-on-the-visor shot. Davis, we thought we'd show it to you like this, without all that-- Put it back. Don't show me anything. You don't need it. You're not even giving it a chance. How's the rearview mirror gag supposed to work without it? Am l the only one here who respects the writing? l gotta help these kids on the bus. Right, the counselor in training. When l get back from camp, l'm gonna practice driving every time we get in the car. That gives me a month to relax. - Have a great time, pal. - You, too. Okay. - l'll write a lot. - Yeah. All right, you have 15 seconds to tell me all the mother stuff one more time. Sunscreen, hat, allergy pills, summer reading, floss. Watch out for poison oak, Lyme ticks, bears, dragons, pestilence. Just be careful, okay? Write if you need anything. Mom, l'm going to camp, not the army. l love you, sweetheart. Me, too.

Good. l'm having a good day. - Why are you whispering? - Am l whispering? l guess l'm feeling quiet. l'm sitting out back. l talked to Davis. - How is he doing? - Terrible. Apparently the bullet just tore the shit out of everything. lt's gonna take a long time to recover, and then he may have a limp, - but they're not sure. - That's awful. - l can barely hear you, honey. - l said that's awful. Yeah. Listen, do you still wanna go out tonight? No, we can't. l don't feel like it. - l'll make something here. - l like the sound of that. - l gotta go. - Mack. - Yeah? - Don't work late. l won't. Bye, baby. Surprise, surprise. Yes, yes. lt's okay. Sweetie. Shit! ( whistles ) - ( dialing ) - ( rings ) ( electronic beeping ) ( laughs ) "How's my girl doing today?" "Why aren't you out on a date, beauty?" ( laughs ) "What's with school?" - So? - Hmm? Come on, don't give me a hard time. Dee, nobody knows less about men than me. - You do all right. - ( scoffs ) Okay, let me ask you one question first. - Do you like yourjob? - l know what you're gonna say. Because you can kiss it goodbye. lt never fails. l absolutely guarantee you the thing ends with you losing yourjob. And not because you're the missus now, living in the big house. - Don't think that's gonna happen. - l don't think that. l wouldn't even want that. Give me a little credit, will you? One of the things l think is so great about him is how devoted he is to his wife and kid. You are so full of shit. You know that? You may not even know, but you really are. You're saying what they all say at first. l've seen it many times, honey. lf he is so devoted to his wife, what's he doing messing around with you? He hasn't done anything. You told me you were holding hands and getting all soulful today. Big deal. l shouldn't even have told you. You gotta tell somebody that shit. That's how you know it's really happening. Otherwise it's too goddamn lonely. We must be going about this whole thing wrong or something. What thing? The love thing. The touch thing. Where there's somebody to touch you, real nice and gentle. lt doesn't have to be that gentle. Whatever. Jane, do you ever feel like you're just this far from being completely hysterical 24 hours a day? Half the people l know feel that way. The lucky ones feel that way. The rest of the people are hysterical 24 hours a day. - Claire, l'm here. - Hi, Mack. You forgot to bring in the mail. There's something here from Carol. Mack, come on up here. l wanna show you something. - ls something wrong? - Mnh-mnh. Whose is it? Claire: She's beautiful, isn't she? ls it the Wilson kid? Huh-uh. - Who? - l don't know. - What do you mean? - l don't know who the parents are. Come on, Claire. Don't make me guess. - Where did it come from? - ( shushes ) So what's the story? l found her. l was jogging, and l heard this crying, - and l looked under these bushes-- - Wait, wait. Where was this? On Carmelina, just around the corner. So l looked under the bushes and there she was. - When was this? - This morning. This morning? What time? Around 9:30, l guess. What did the police say? Hmm? My guess is the police did not say "hmm." So l guess my next guess is you haven't called the police. Claire, you know it's possible this baby was kidnapped and someone's been frantically looking for it all day. l don't think so. l could tell, but l listened to the news three times. There wasn't a thing about it. That doesn't mean a thing. They may not have announced it yet, or maybe they're waiting to hear from the kidnappers. This baby wasn't kidnapped, l can tell you that, Mack. This baby was deserted by its mother and it's going to need a new one. Claire. - Are you okay? - l'm fine. You do know that we're gonna have to call the police right now? Of course, Mack. l haven't taken leave of my senses. l just wanted you to see her, so l waited till you got home, that's all. She's so beautiful. l just wanted you to see her. l told you that baby wasn't kidnapped. ( laughs ) l told him, l said, "Mister, there's no way this vehicle is worth as much as you're gonna pay to tow it." But he didn't care. He tells me, "lt got sentimental value!" Woman: What's so funny about that? Maybe it did. Yeah, and maybe he got his first piece in there. Otis, watch your mouth. What did he say, Mama? Nothing, baby. Just bring me that meatloaf. Also, this was the car he was sitting in the first time he was ever shot. Man! He had some good times in there. Are we gonna play roundy-roundy, Uncle Simon? Unh-unh. Time for bed, little girl. One game. Come on, Mommy. You said we could play one game. Simon: One game, Mommy, please. ln your pajamas, teeth brushed. Go on. Get ready to get whipped, homes. Ooooh! l know l started something. Baby, don't you wanna stay home and be with your uncle? l gotta go out. l gotta meet some people. - Take it slow, Simon. - All righty. Whoa! Ooh! From the shoulders, old man, you still got it! - l ain't over yet, baby. - l'll be back soon, Ma. Okay. - ( growls ) - ( laughing ) Hit me! Hey! Don't anybody come from the shoulders anymore, huh? Anybody got the hands, huh? Man, l wish. Seem like every time you turn around, some sucker's coming from the pocket, and he's strapped. You know, l never laid any shit on you, did l? l love you, Otis, and l love my sister. l don't want her to have any more pain than she's already had. You know, she's suffering here every night till you come home. We don't even get into that no more. When we're together we're trying to have it be good. That's why l got to-- lf we ain't talkin' about it, why you gotta talk about it? lt ain't gonna change nothin'. You sure? Maybe we can figure out something together. What, what? What, man? You gonna figure out something that nobody else around here thought of? - Later, Simon. - Hey. Hey. Plenty have gotten out, Otis. - l don't want out. - Bullshit. Without my set, l'm nothing. They care about me, man. Hey, you wanna be gangbanging when you're 25? Shit. l'll never live to be 25. l gotta roll. l'll call you Friday. - Drive safely. - All right. ( dog barking ) ( gunfire ) Kelley! ( screams ) Kelley! Kelley! Kelley, get down! Mama! Mama! - ( tires screeching ) - ( crying ) ( wailing ) Well, look who's up and at 'em. Somebody leave your curtains open last night? l asked them to. l wanted to see this. City of the angels. l have seen the light. Mazel tov. Watch your hands. Right there. Right there. - Close. - Lift your end. - Right there. - Be careful. ( glass tinkling ) ( gasps ) ( chattering ) l'll be right back. Hi, Jackson. Let me see that elbow. Come on, just one look. l wanna see if it's as good as my knee. Aww. This is just a scrape, man. Shit, my knee was a real mess. This thing is just half-bad. Did Adam push you? Should we talk to him? - How come? - He's an asshole. Maybe, but we could discuss it. You having a bad day? Did you get a letter from your mom today? Did she say she missed you? Oh, man. My mom used to do that. Made me nuts. They love you so much, they don't even know it's gonna make you feel terrible. l missed my mom so much the first year l came here. And then when she wrote me and said she missed me, l felt so lonely. ls that how you feel? Well, you got me. Mack: Just don't tell him. So Harlan told him anyway. What else would Harlan do? The only way he wouldn't have told him is if l had told him to tell him. Honey, l just don't think l can talk about Harlan again tonight. l've been begging you to get away from him for the past eight years. What, so l can go start a new immigration practice on my own? That night when l thought those boys were gonna kill me, l realized l hate fucking immigration law. No, you don't. You like it and you're good at it. What you hate is being partners with an asshole like Harlan. We don't have to talk about this. Maybe you hate some other part of your life and you don't wanna admit it. What? What did you say? When a person thinks that they're about to die, nothing they did that day is gonna look like it was worth their time. That's not what you were gonna say. lf you're so sure you know what l'm gonna say, l guess l don't have to say anything. Look, Mack, l don't even know what l'm gonna say from one second to the next. The world doesn't make any sense to me anymore. l mean, what's going on? There are babies lying around in the streets. There are people living in boxes. There are people ready to shoot you if you look at them. And we're getting used to it. The world is so nuts, it makes me wonder about all the choices that we've made. - Jesus Christ. - What? Oh, shit! Let's see what you-- wow. Damn, that smarts! - Hold it up. Apply pressure. - Pressure, pressure. l'm gonna take you to the hospital. l think they're gonna have to sew that up. No. Really? l don't think it's that bad. - Here. Let's see. Take it off. - ( winces ) Oh, God. - Look at this. - Under the water. See what happens when you yell at me? Never again, baby. Maybe next time you'll be a little more understanding when l start to bitch about my life. - Here. Okay. - Ow! Ow. Here, let me. l'm gonna get my purse. l'm gonna take you to St. John's. Maybe you'd better sit down for a second. l really don't think l need to get this sewn up. Mack, are you afraid of a few stitches? l'm not afraid of anything. l just think we oughta take a moment to discuss this. You're kidding, right? - ( laughs ) - What, are you going into shock? l just hate seeing my blood spill out of me like that. - Does everybody-- - ( rumbling ) Earthquake! - Big one. Let's get outta here. Run! - Where are we going? Claire: Aren't we supposed to-- Aren't we supposed to-- - l don't care! - ( car alarms blaring ) l'm sorry. l'm never complaining again. - Bullshit. - No, no, l swear. You'll forget about all this tomorrow. No, no, no. Did you feel that? l think there's an aftershock coming. Sally, did your chandelier fall down again? - No. - Oh, good! Woman: Claire! Claire! - Louise, what's the matter? - Claire! - What? - lt's Byron. l don't know what's wrong with him. l dialed 911 . The line's busy. - Claire, l don't know what's happening. - Louise, calm down. Everything's gonna be okay. We'll be right there. ( exhales ) - He's bleeding! - No, he's not. That's Mack. Claire: Come on, come on, come on. Yes, l need an ambulance right away. 222 Avondale. What? Yes. Yes. Male. 79, l think. Heart attack maybe. Maybe, l don't know. ( siren wailing ) ( helicopter whirring ) ( gasps, screaming ) ( sighs ) Simon: Hey, Mack! Mack! Over here! Come on! Give me a flyby! Yeah! ( laughing ) ( baby crying ) Roberto: Mom, l think you need to get organized. ( baby crying ) ( siren wailing ) ( wind gusting ) ( indistinct conversations ) ( man shouting ) ( train whistle blowing ) ( glass squeaks ) ( baby cries ) ( baby crying ) ( insects buzzing ) ( gasps ) Mack. Mack, wake up. So now tell me that again. You have the baby at home now? - Mack, that's wonderful. - No, that's not what l said. l said Claire wants to adopt the baby. Claire is so great. So you don't have the baby at home. So what's the problem? You're not allowed to just keep every baby you find, are you? Aren't there laws and shit about that kind of thing? Yeah, there are laws, but there is a process you can go through, and Claire has already started collecting the forms. She is the most self-actualized person l ever met. She is this week. - Home sweet home. - Mr. Davis. Hiya, Leonard. Good to see you. All right, just toss me in. Just roll me back and just flip me in. l'm gonna go check the car, okay, sweetie? l'm wearing a cast. What can happen? See you back at the house, okay, Tony? You got it. Mabel, l am never gonna forget the times we had. As you know perfectly well, my name is Esther. My mother's name was Esther, and since you have been so much kinder to me than my mother ever was, l have given you a better name, and when l think of the experience that changed my life, l will think appreciatively of you. You are very kind. Remember, if you start to feel some pressure in there, that means it's time to get the pus drained. l love it when you talk that way about the pus and everything. Don't you have a favorite charity you can give this to? A favorite child? A favorite horse? This is very unusual for me. l'm notoriously cheap. - Ask anyone. - lt's true. Goodbye, Davis. Okay, a hug. Come on, a hug, a hug. - Okay. - There we go. Okay. - So long. Bye. - Take it easy. Leonard, get me out of here. So tell me about this life change. lt's not a life change. l had some kind of vision, some insight, but l don't wanna talk about it. Tell him, Davis. He's your best friend. Hey, we're talking about Mack and his new baby. Besides, l think if you talk about stuff, then maybe that takes the place of doing it. That's never been one of your big problems. No kidding. So Claire wants this baby, but you're not too high on the idea. And it's not that you don't like kids. ln fact, Roberto's maybe the best thing that ever happened in your life, but he's 15 now. He's pretty much done with you. Pretty soon he'll be moving out, and you thought you and Claire could get back to the kind of freedom you had back when you were first married. Fact is, you feel you're getting old way too fast. The last thing you had in mind was start a new family, with all the whining and the diapers and the attendant baby baggage. l mean, what do you wanna start with all that shit again for when you already wake up wondering if you did the right thing the first time? Davis, you're awful! This is so much more time-efficient than a regular conversation. So, since you're currently obsessed with the question of what's going down and why are you going with it, what kind of shape are you in to take on some new baby who came from God knows where and has God knows what kind of health and emotional problems? And never asked to be taken in anyway. - On the other hand... - ( laughing ) Hey, baby, what's the matter? ( sniffling ) While we got a moment here, maybe you can explain something to me l never understood. What is the theory on this handkerchief thing? After you blow your nose in it, you put it back in your pocket, and then you see someone distressed and you, like, give them this gift from your pocket? And they're supposed to be grateful as they wipe it all over their face? lf l tell you, you're gonna think it's about you. But it's not about you at all, but you won't believe it and you'll get all defensive. Hey, if you don't wanna talk about it, don't force yourself. lt's just that l wanna have children. l really wanna have them, and l don't care how rotten the world is. l wanna have them anyway, but l'm so far from being able to have them. l'm all involved with you, and you're not gonna have kids with me. We're not even gonna get married, so l'm so far from a situation where l can even even start to try to have 'em. l gotta break up with you and find someone else who l can stand to be with. Even then, l don't know how easy it's gonna be. l might have trouble getting pregnant or something after everything l've done to my body. Maybe l should just hop out up here. l can call a cab or something. Why, Mack? You're my friend, too, aren't you? Hey, hey. Who says we're never gonna get married and have kids? No you didn't. Well, doesn't it? ( laughs ) ( scrubbing ) Unh-unh. Come on, baby. Hey. Hey, how you doing? l don't know if you remember me. Oh, hey, man, sure. - Mack, right? - Right. Yeah, l didn't recognize you at first. Yeah. l called and they said you'd be getting in about now. Oh, okay. l wanted to thank you again for the other night. You did already. Look, can l buy you breakfast somewhere or something? Sure. Just a minute. - You play basketball? - Mack: l played in high school. l was sixth man for a year and a half. Me, too. Sixth man until my senior year, and then l started. No kidding. Center or forward? Forward. l wasn't big enough for center. Must have been some team. We had Oscar Benson on that team. No shit. You must be pretty good. l wasn't playing the same game that Oscar was playing. Look, the other night, l don't know if you were in so much danger, except for maybe losing your wallet. l didn't save your life, so you shouldn't be thinking you have to say something to me or anything. One morning, about three years ago, l was on my way to a meeting at the Mutual Benefit building on Wilshire, in the Miracle Mile. l love that name-- the Miracle Mile. lt's the building across the street from the county art museum. l was thinking about the meeting l was going to. l was worried about it, actually. l started to step off the curb, and a stranger grabbed me and yanked me back as a city bus went flying by my nose. l mean, it just filled up the world six inches from my nose. l would have been like a wet bug stain on the front of the bus. l wouldn't have even felt it, it would have been over so fast. l thanked this stranger, this woman in a baseball cap, but l was pretty much in a daze. When l thanked her, she said, "My pleasure." l didn't notice till the last moment that the cap she was wearing was from the Pittsburgh Pirates, my favorite team since l was a kid. Simon: Roberto Clemente, huh? Right. l never got over the idea that l should have thanked that woman more, talked to her a little while, something. She reached out and yanked me back from the edge, literally. Changed everything for me and for my wife and my son, and then she just wandered off down the Miracle Mile. How come she was wearing a Pirates cap? lt's not your usual thing at 9:00 a.m. on Wilshire Boulevard, a woman in a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cap. - lt's a little suspicious. - You lost me. l just wondered, later on, was she for real, you know? Was that a real person or was that something else, you know, sent from somewhere else, to grab me back from that curb? ls that what you're wondering about me? l just couldn't let it happen again. l didn't wanna just let you drift away like she did and never talk to you. lt didn't seem right to let it happen twice. So that's why l'm bothering you. You're not bothering me. You're just buying me breakfast. Good. You got a right to try to figure out what confuses you, but seems like you're making more of this than it is. The world's a hard place, but sometimes you just get lucky. l believe in luck. And, of course, sometimes you don't. One thing is for sure, if you're alive, some terrible shit's gonna happen to you, and maybe some good things, too, but you can always count on the terrible. lf it doesn't kill you, you're gonna be around to see it come down some other way. Thank you, honey. No. No, thanks. My father died last year. 81 years old. lt's a long time for a black man to live in this town. He outlived everyone he ever knew. He saw two wives die and three of his children. He had a great ugly old face that looked like a suitcase gone a million miles, all beat up and dented and scuffed and stained. Man, he looked like he walked 80 years on that face. When l used to look at that face and see all the pain there, all the things he'd lost, all the hurt he had, l wondered why he wanted to go on, why he just didn't lay down and give it up. Did you figure it out? No. Never figured out much about that guy. - l asked him, though. - What'd he say? Habit. Does your sister have a job? Yeah, she's a cashier at Jon's. Lets her work her hours around her little girl's school. Would they let her transfer to another store, do you think? l don't know. Why? l was just wondering about something. What's that? lt just seems like an impossible situation. You can't live your life like that, thinking someone's gonna shoot up your house at any moment. A lot of people do. You know, l know this guy who's got an apartment house in Canoga Park. l might be able to get her something out there at a very reasonable price. Listen, Mack, thanks, but l'm not so sure it's a good idea. Okay, l'm not gonna push it if you're not comfortable. Maybe you wanna think about it. You don't have to decide now. - Yeah, maybe. - Okay. - You got my number. - Yeah. Simon. Yeah? What is it, exactly? l wanna know for two reasons. l wanna know if it's what l think it is, and l wanna make sure l haven't done something to offend you 'cause that's the last thing l wanted to do. Man, you are a piece of work. l know. lt's just sometimes l let stuff go and then l wonder about it later on. Okay, here it is. l guess l think it's hard, maybe even dangerous, reaching in and mucking around with other people's lives. Sometimes there's a reason they're doing what they're doing. That's a tough one. You don't wanna fuck with things you shouldn't, but you don't always wanna turn away, either. ls that what you thought it was? Yeah, that and... you know... the white guy. You white? ( laughs ) Hey, how about Canoga Park? That's pretty white, ain't it? No, not really. Think about it. l'll see you. To try and understand just what exactly had been delivered unto me at the cost of flesh and bone and precious blood, what message was being delivered to me in a .38-caliber envelope for me to open and read and understand. And this problem, this difficulty l was having in understanding, it grew on me like a fever. lt buzzed around my brain till l could no longer sleep or eat or think about anything else. lt was as painful and real as the physical wound l could see in my thigh. - What? - Nothing. Go on. l want to hear this. You know, Claire, l had a feeling that you, more than anyone else would have a problem taking me seriously. Please, go on, Davis. l am taking you seriously. l'm sorry for whatever you think you saw. l will go on, but first you have to tell me what made you smile. - "Unto." - What? You said "delivered unto" you. l'm sorry. That is purposeful, my sweet. We're talking about a religious experience here. l might say "doth" or "thou" or a lot of things. Please, Davis, go on. The suspense is killing me. At the end of this long, torturous night, my head pounding in syncopation to my throbbing wound, there came a glorious, delicate dawn. And l knew l can't make those movies anymore. l can't make another piece of art that glorifies violence and bloodshed and brutality. l can't contribute another stone to this landslide of dehumanizing rage that has swept across this country like a pestilence. That's a mixed metaphor, isn't it? Anyway... l'm done, kaput, fini. No more exploding bodies, exploding buildings, exploding anything. No more shit. Davis, that's wonderful. You know how l feel about it. l think l've always been frank with you. To say the least. But you'll never have to say another word. Excellent. l applaud you. Have you told the studio yet? Fuck the studio. Have you told your business manager yet? Fuck 'em, Claire. You're the one who said it all along-- there's a fortune to be made in stories about life. The life force, the creation of life, the very instinct for living. Besides, l don't give a shit about money. l made more money this year than my father made in his entire life. At the rate l'm going, l'm not gonna run out of money for-- well, 18 months, anyway. l'm gonna make the world a better place for your new bambina. What's happening? What's happening? Well, let's see. We're filling out forms. We're being evaluated. We're becoming official foster parents, which would be the first step. We're-- we're arguing, we're talking, we're flirting with marital disaster. ( sighs ) Mack and l are both being passionately, unshakably devoted to our own position. Claire, may l be very, very frank with you? ls it possible this has come up because Roberto's about to move on and you are coincidentally approaching a certain age? As opposed to what? l mean say as opposed to being wildly in love with this particular baby which l had in my house for nine hours? Of course that's why this has come up, Davis. lt's not that simple, but yes. But is that rational? - Rational? - Reasonable, feasible, for you and Mack? Well... l guess l'd have to say l don't really care. And it's in Canoga Park, you know. A nice little apartment complex, he says. He owns it, his associate. - lt'd be real reasonable with the rent. - Canoga Park? Yeah, yeah. Simon, that's a bunch of white people, isn't it? Uh-huh. - l got it round trip. - ( laughing ) Yeah, right. Jane: l can go to the hotel, though. Do you even want to go to Cabo San Lucas? - ( mumbles ) - Hmm? - Hi. - Hi. - Do you know Jane? - No. - This is Mack. - Hi, Mack. - Hi, Jane. - You wanna sit down? Thanks, l got something l should do upstairs. ( laughs ) - l'm having one of those days. - Jane: Which kind? l keep drifting. l can't seem to carry through on anything. Like l'll say l have to go upstairs, but l don't really want to, so l don't go. - Have a seat. - Thanks. At the same time l'm feeling very free, like l've got a little buzz on or something. Does that happen to you? lt doesn't happen to me as much as l'd like. lt's very pleasant. What brought it on? Maybe l'll try it. l don't know. l got up really early this morning. Sometimes it helps to be a little sleepy. l got that part down. l went to see this guy that helped me when my car broke down. He drives a tow truck. l really like him. His daughter goes to this deaf college in Washington, DC. His wife left him. He's kinda lonely, but he seems peaceful about it. That would be nice. Yeah, it would be great if you could sort of be down about things, but still be all right with it, like finally accept the fact that you're gonna feel bad most of the time and not fight it. Of course, it would also be nice not to feel bad most of the time. Yeah, but that's how you get in trouble, by thinking how nice it'd be to be happy more. - Jane, are you married? - No. - Have a boyfriend? - No. Would you like to meet this guy? l don't know. What does he look like? How important is that? - Somewhat important. - l was just curious. l mean, he happens to be a very handsome black guy. l don't even know if he's interested. l don't know that much about him. How are you gonna describe Jane? Same way. A very handsome black guy? Yeah. - ( doorbell buzzes ) - Mama, there's a man here. - Yes. - Hello, Mrs. Dotson. You have got a very polite little lady there. - What is it? - My name is Harvey Charles. l represent the Ohio Continental lnsurance Company. - Here's my card. - You're selling insurance? - Yes, ma'am. - We don't want any life insurance. That's the first thing most people say. You see, the policies we're selling only cost $10 per month. Mister, l am too young and too strapped to be getting life insurance. We're not just talking about you here, Mrs. Dotson. Think about your children. l ask you only one thing, Mrs. Dotson, and that is this. Just glance at these news clippings, which l hold here in my hand. What about 'em? What they show, in frightening detail, is the high rate of violent death caused by gangs and crime in yours and surrounding neighborhoods. Can l hand these to you to take a look at? Look, Mrs. Dotson, l'm not gonna kid you. These policies are inexpensive because the benefits aren't that big when they pay off. But what they will do is, if harm should come to one of your children, this policy will cover all funeral expenses and arrangements. Kelley, go wait in the kitchen. - What? - Go. You tryin' to sell me life insurance policies on my kids? Ma'am, they're the ones on the front line. They're the ones in danger. You get the fuck off my porch! l said go on! Get away from my house, damn it! ( man mumbling ) Bottom of the list. Who needs it? Beaufort, South Carolina. Why bother trying? Keep the baby. You need her as much as she needs you. lt's big for the money. lt's not beautiful, but they keep it up pretty good. They have their share of gangs out here, too. But they don't run the place. Not yet, anyway. l guess Kelley would eventually adjust. Deborah's really confused. lt's a big move. And l don't know what to tell her, either. Either way, thank you, man. ♪ Darkness in the morning ♪ ♪ Shadows on the land ♪ ♪ Certain individuals ♪ ♪ Aren't sticking to the plan ♪ ♪ And l'm searching for a heart ♪ ♪ Searching everyone ♪ ♪ They say love conquers all ♪ ♪ You can't start it like a car ♪ ♪ You can't stop it with a gun. ♪ Woman: Excuse me. - Are you Roberto's mother? - Yes. We're Amanda's parents. l'm Steve Fox. This is my wife Cathy. - Hi. Claire. - We can't wait to meet Roberto. We feel like we already know him, just from Amanda's letters. l'm sorry. l'm afraid that Roberto doesn't write as much as he should. We're very pleased about Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving? lt is so good of you to let Roberto come to San Diego. Gosh. l'm sorry. l guess you may not have heard everything about this summer. l'm beginning to get the picture. - There's my parents. - Which ones? See the man in the beard? Oh, God. They're talking to my mother. They were so relieved l wasn't Puerto Rican. You mean Amanda didn't explain that in all the many, many letters that she wrote to her parents? God, l hope they're not bigots or something. - Did you wanna tell me about it? - What? What happened this summer. At camp? Camp was okay. l really missed you, kid. l'm glad you're back. Yeah, me, too. l'm sorry about that Thanksgiving thing. - We'll talk to your father about it. - lt's okay with you? Didn't say that. Let's talk to Dad about it. - But your mind's open? - Roberto. Okay, remain calm. Let me ask you something. How open is your mind? ls this gonna be about my hair? No. This is something pretty big. - About me? - Only partly it involves you. Are you and Dad splitting? - Why do you say that? - ls that it? No. Absolutely no. Why would you say a thing like that? Do we look like people who are about to split? l don't know. People do it all the time and they look like they're fine. l am crazy for your father. Have we given you any sign that we're having trouble? So what were you gonna tell me? Wait a minute. Answer me. Sometimes it just looks like you're both kind of unhappy, okay? Maybe l misunderstood. lt just looked like that a lot before l went away. - Really? - Yeah, but look, l'm glad l'm wrong. l mean, God, that'd be horrible. l hope you guys never split. l'm sorry l said it. Now what were you gonna tell me? What do l have to have an open mind about? Maybe we should talk about it later. Mom, you can't do that to me. Just pretend l never said anything and tell me. Your father and l are discussing whether to adopt a little girl. What? To, you know, the evening. Some playboy, huh? - Nice car. - Thank you. lt's yellow. Of course it's yellow. What am l talking about? All right. Okay. l thought you'd changed your mind. No way. lt's just been a while since l did this. You haven't been going out? l go out a little. l just can't remember the last time l was set up. - Fixed up. - Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think so far? So far it's all right. l like it. l'm just a little surprised. - Why? What did you expect? - No, it's not you. l'm just surprised at how nervous l am. - Me, too. - Yeah? Yeah. That's all right. At least now we know that much about each other. ( laughs ) Yeah. Mack must have had some reason to think this would work. l guess you've known him a while, huh? l don't know him at all. Really? Wow. l don't know him much, either. That's funny. Maybe we're the only two black people he ever met. ( laughing ) l think you're being too hard on yourself. You're trying to help. You think moving to Canoga Park is gonna save that family? Who said you have to save anybody? Maybe out there the kids'll be a little less likely to get hurt. Who knows? l don't and you don't. Besides, they're not gonna go if they don't want to, and you're not responsible for them anyhow. You just happen to know a guy who owns an apartment house. What am l doing fixing Simon up with some girl l don't even know? l do this shit, and the next morning l'm astounded. Has it occurred to you that it doesn't really matter all that much? Why should you be the one person on earth who always acts rationally? Forget rational. l'm completely out of control. - Stop me before l kill. - Well, so, good for you. Aren't you sick of trying to be in control all the time? l am. Mack, you think that l want that baby because l've got some hole in my life or l think l'm gonna have some hole in my life, but that's not it. Or if it is it, it's just a part of it. That baby needs someone to love it and take care of it. Does it have to be you? l believe that there's a reason l found her. - Claire. - l do. You can dismiss it all you want, but l'll always believe that. And you probably do, too. You told me you thought there was a reason this guy, this Simon showed up and saved you. l did? How do you think l feel about this baby? What if l hadn't heard it? What if no one had heard her? We would have read about it in the "Times." "Oh, my God. They found a dead baby under the bushes on Carmelina. Oh, Mack. l must have run right by it the other morning." But that didn't happen. l found her. And maybe l saved her life just the way maybe Simon saved yours. - What are you saying? - Something has happened. You can't go back and have it not happen. Some kind of connection has been made. lt has to be played out. That is why you can't stay out of Simon's business. lt's like this itch you've gotta scratch. Claire, you're talking about a lifelong commitment just because you happened to be running by those bushes. l'm not gonna be dealing with this Simon guy the rest of my life. How do you know that? How do you know that this man isn't gonna be your friend until the day that you die? What if these are miracles, Mack? Maybe we don't have any experience with miracles, so we're slow to recognize them. - l'm getting a terrific headache. - No, you're not. l'm not? l'll tell you why l reject your headache. - Please. - Because it's inappropriate. lnappropriate? lf l am right and these events are truly miracles, then it is an inappropriate response to get a headache in the presence of a miracle. Ahhh. - Wow. - Yeah. l don't know about you, but l'm thinking this Mack must be some kind of genius. - Do you believe in fate? - l believe in luck. - Do you think you should come up? - Do l think l should come up? What do you think? Well, l think this night has gone about as well as it possibly could. l don't wanna push our luck. ls it okay to call you at work? l look forward to it. This is a feeling l'd like to have at work. What is it? ( laughs ) - Bye, Simon. - Say that again. Simon. ( sighs ) ( blows ) ( lock rattles ) ( screams ) ( tires screech ) - ( gasps ) - ( siren wailing ) You okay? Whoa. You sure? Why don't you just pull right over there? - Didn't see him coming, did you? - l still don't know what happened. l guess you were lucky. Even though it might not seem that way right now. - Pretty scary stuff. - l was crying before it happened. Really? l don't cry this easily normally. - Sorry. - Don't apologize. You wanna get outta there a second? Walk around and catch your breath? Come on, you'll feel better. You okay? Then l guess l'd better hang on. l don't imagine you wanna talk about it with a complete stranger. l'm in love with a married man. We haven't been having an affair. He wouldn't do it. We just had one night together. One really amazing night. Uh-huh. Do you think that's awful? - Which part? - All of it. l think it happens. - Did he treat you bad? - lt hurts. When you love someone and they don't choose you... it's bad. That's the way he's been bad to me. Married men suck. By definition. Are you married? Tell the truth. No, l'm not married. l haven't found the right girl. - ( grunts ) - You can't quit now, babe. lt's the last mile. l'm catching my second wind and it's huge. Oh, man. That's all there is. We did it, man. Just put it anywhere. - That's the end of it, baby. - Good. l don't know if he's even gonna stay here tonight. Let's get a beer. ( hip hop music playing ) ♪ Do l quit and leave it all behind? Will l survive? ♪ ♪ Will l live a long time? Too much to think about in such a short time. ♪ Boy: Get out of the way, man. This is fucked. What you doin', man? No talkin', huh? That's cool. That's cool. l guess you don't want no company. l thought you was talkin' to me. l thought you said l was fucked up. l wasn't talkin' to your sorry ass. Who the fuck were you talkin' to? Were you talkin' to yourself? ( speaking Spanish ) What's up, homes? - Who was that, man? - That chamante was quick. Must've come here from Beirut. You! Stop running and put your hands behind your head. Stop running and put your hands behind your head. - Here we go. - ( siren wailing ) Halt! Halt! Turn around and get down on your stomach. - What? - Down, asshole, and l mean now. Put your right hand behind your back. Bring the other one around. Don't you know what "stop" means? Where you going in such a hurry, pal? - Nowhere. l'm just running. - Running from what? - Nothing. l live around here. - Where? - l don't know. - You don't know. What's that supposed to mean? - Back there, across from the park. - What park? l don't know. They almost smoked me. See a nigga run around here, they smoke you, ask questions later. l ain't stayin' here, l tell you that! l ain't fuckin' stayin' here! What's next? Nothing. l'm quitting. ( sighs ) Tell me. This isn't tolerable. l can't do this anymore. lt's sick. l need to go on. Don't act like you're not relieved. l know you are. l don't want you to go. You know what your trouble is? You just never wanna be the bad guy. You want everything you do to be okay. But it isn't. lf you really didn't want this to happen, then you shouldn't have fucked me. l'm sorry. l think l've said that before. But you didn't mean it. You aren't really sorry it happened, are you? Are you? You've denied me in every way you can. Everything l've wanted, you've denied me. l've been honest with you all along. Even that night. Who gives a shit? Don't you see what you do? Even now, you wanna deny me what's rightfully mine. - Which is? - To resent the hell outta you. To feel totally rejected and hate it. To hate you for doing it to me. There are a lot of good men out there who are gonna treat me like l'm the very thing they want. And then you do that thing with Jane. What? You know, with that guy, that tow truck guy. What about it? What's that got to do with anything? You don't even know, do you? You don't even know why that hurts me so much. Jane's in love. She thinks this could be the one. ls that bad? l thought she was your friend. She is my friend. l'm very happy for her, but it makes me feel like shit that you're out there finding her the love of her life and l'm here like what? l'm here like shit. How do you think that's gonna make me feel? Dee, look, l understand you're angry with me, but why would-- Forget it. lt doesn't have to make sense. l'll stay for two weeks, but you'd better find somebody else. ls Otis coming home tonight, Mama? No, baby, l told you. When will we see him again? l don't know, honey. ( laughing ) Yeah. l just feel like l'd really like to work for a woman lawyer this time. l never have, and l think it might be a good thing. Well, l'm not sure you'd find it much different, Dee, but with your qualifications and experience, l have no desire to discourage you. l am curious, though. Your former employer has written you the most glorious recommendation. Why did you decide to leave him? ( helicopter whirring ) Hey, Otis. - What's the matter? You okay? - Yeah, l'm all right. You're hurt, boy. lt ain't my blood. What happened? What happened? l seen some bad shit, Simon. ( crying ) Man: We have a three-car collision to report on the Santa Monica Freeway east of National Boulevard. Only one lane is open, and, Ted, l've got to tell you the surface streets are no picnic right now, either. lt is a jungle down there. l realized it wasn't really both you and Mom who were saying how glad you were you didn't have any little kids anymore. lt was really just you. When l really thought about it, Mom never really said that. Which way are you gonna turn up here? Right. Okay, so what do you wanna do now? Get in the right lane. ( horn honks ) No! Whoa! Roberto! You can't just go because you want to! - You've gotta make sure it's clear. - l messed up. l messed up. Better to go 10 blocks out of your way than to try to get over when it's impossible. Okay, watch this guy getting out of his car here. Slow down. Slow, slow, slow! When l tell you to stop, you've gotta stop! You didn't tell me to stop. You told me to slow down. lt won't matter if you hit another car, but you can't hit a person. That's the most important thing. People are such assholes. You gotta watch out for the dumbest stuff. ( horn honks ) Just watch the road. So l was thinking why should l tell Mom she's crazy to want this baby? l don't want her telling me my stuff is crazy, right? Maybe it's not so crazy for her. lt's her life. - And mine. - And yours, too, l guess. Although she is gonna be the one most involved. Believe me, it affects us both a lot. Look, why don't we concentrate on what we're doing here? - What are you gonna do up here? - l'm gonna take a left. Really? lt's kind of busy here, isn't it? Dad, l've gotta learn how to do it. No, no, you're right. - Left-turn signal, left-turn signal. - lt's on. Mack: Okay. This is good right here. Perfect. Think of it this way. lf you only had one life to live, which you do, and you really wanted to do something and Mom said, "No, you can't do that," how would that make you feel? Let's not talk. Let's think about this turn. - Right. - What are you watching for? - The light. - What else? What's the most important thing? - Don't hit a person. - No, l mean here. Come on, don't fuck around. This is no joke. l'm sorry. The most important thing is that those cars have really stopped. Right. Because? Because some idiot is always liable to run a red light. Good. What else are you lookin' for? Those cars in the cross streets. Good. Get ready. The light's gonna change here. This is good. Wait. Not yet. - Okay, they're stopping. - ( horn honks ) Go ahead. - Stop! - ( horns honk ) - You idiot! - Fuck you! - Whoa! - Woman: Learn to drive, asshole! This guy's letting us in. Go, go, go! Okay, when l tell you, you're gonna be able to get over. We'll pull over up here. Okay, you can go now. Just pull in right here. Shit. That guy was a cretin. The thing is, it's so crazy out there, you gotta react really fast. lf you're going, you've only got a split second to do it, otherwise the cross traffic will whack you. - l'm sorry, Dad. - Hey, this is difficult stuff. Making a left turn in LA is one of the harder things you're gonna learn in life. That guy was almost in your lap. This town stinks. - Do you wanna drive? - Hell, no. l'm too shook up. Let's get outta here. ( gears grind ) So l guess we're gonna get this baby, huh? ( telephone rings ) Hello. What? We've got no Firooz here. No, you've got the wrong number. Oh, really? Well, fuck you, also. ( laughs ) - Who? - Firooz. You know him? My heart's pounding. Come here. lt's okay. Everything seems so close together. All the good and bad things in the world. Everything. l feel it in myself even. And in us. Our marriage. l love you, Claire. l like living my life with you. Do you? 'Cause l love you so much, Mack. - Drive me over to the stage. - My car's over by your office. You can take the cart back. l'll have someone pick me up. - l really gotta get back downtown. - Relax. No one's gonna get deported while you drive me over to stage 20. We spent the whole lunch talking about Vanessa and your impending marriage. l forgot to congratulate you on the new direction your career has taken. - On the what? - Claire told me. You know, about the violence in your movies. She was so pleased. - Claire told you? - Yeah. Oh, that. Oh, fuck that. - What? - That's over. l must have been delirious for a few weeks there. - Hi, Tim. How are you? - Oh, man. This is bad. l don't wanna be the one to tell Claire you changed your mind. Changed nothing. l've regained my senses. l was talking like a moron. Go down here and go left. What happened? Nothing happened. lt never happened. Look, Mack, l'm an artist. Now go ahead and laugh, because everybody does. Nobody in this town will admit that a producer is an artist. Hey, how you doing? But l know what l do. l know how many lame-o directors l've had to carry on my back every step of the way and then watch as they take the glory and reviews and awards. Which awards were those? That's okay. l don't mind working in modest anonymity. That's the way Thalberg did it, too. lf they're so lame-o, why do you hire them? 'Cause l haven't got time to do it myself. Hanging around the set all day, doing that boring lighting and shit. Let them do that. That's beside the point. The point is-- Turn around. Turn around and go back down there. - Where was l? - The point is... The point is there's a gulf in this country, an ever-widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have shit. lt's like this big hole has opened up in the ground as big as the fucking Grand Canyon. And what's come pouring out-- Hi. - Hi. - My name's Davis. Building 78. The whole building. You should stop by. l think l have something for you. This is the greatest town on earth. Go left here. - Where was l? - Grand Canyon. Yeah. And what's come outta this big hole is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence, and the violence is real, Mack. And nothing's gonna make it go away until someone changes something. Which is not gonna happen. And you may not like it. Even l may not like it. But l can't pretend it isn't there, because that is a lie. And when art lies, it becomes worthless, so l gotta keep telling the truth, even if it scares the shit outta me, like it scares the shit outta you. Even if it means some motherfucker can blow a big old hole in my leg for a watch and l'm gonna walk with a fucking limp for the rest of my life and count myself lucky. That's what's amazing, what we count as lucky today. l mean our criteria for lucky has changed a bit. Davis, we're not talking about great art here. Says you, Mr. Snob, Mr. Arbiter of Taste, Mr. lmmigration Lawyer to the Arts. l'll tell you this, though. There's so much rage going around, we're damn lucky we have the movies to help us vent a little of it. Oh, that line is so tired. l'm shocked you'd use it. You think just anyone can do what l do? You think anyone can make the crap l make? Wasn't there something about "life force"? Or "life affirming"? Something like that. - That's what Claire told me. - This is life, pal. That's what l'm trying to get that through your thick, sanctimonious skull. There's always been violence. There will always be violence, violence and evil and men with big guns. My movies reflect what's going on. They don't make what's going on. And if l happen to make 'em better than anyone, then l've got a bigger responsibility than anyone to serve it up. Mack, you ever seen a movie called "Sullivan's Travels"? - No. - That's part of your problem. You haven't seen enough movies. All of life's riddles are answered in the movies. lt's a story about a man who loses his way. He's a filmmaker, like me, and he forgets for a moment just what he was set on earth to do. Fortunately, he finds his way back. That can happen, Mack. Check it out. ( laughs ) You're kinda big, aren't you? You look like you about ready to play. Yeah. Maybe. l wanna see you shoot from the outside. Mack, what made you get me together with Jane? Dumbness, l guess. Compulsion to stick my nose where it doesn't belong. - Why, has it ended badly? - No, it hasn't ended at all. She's the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. Really? No shit? Yeah, so there you go, my friend. Sometimes things work. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, then. To 20. Take it out from back there. Winner takes it out. You sure? You might not get a chance to shoot. You're going down. That is so cool about you and Jane. Yeah, it's cool. That's why l came out here tonight. l thought of a way to thank you. - You don't have to thank me. - l have an idea. lf you're up for it, l thought of something l could do for you. You don't have to do anything for me, just play ball. That's why l came out here. l thought of a way just to let you know l appreciate you for-- For introducing me to Jane. End of the line, folks. Oh. So what do you think? l think it's not all bad. ( bird squawking )
