THE CIRCUMSTANCE - Hello. - Miss, it's me. - Good morning, madam. Did you call counsel Pieruggi for the sale's contract. He left a note for this afternoon. There's a draft on the table. But it's only a minute, it's not the final document. I prefer to talk a little bit more with him. Please, be sure that it is readable. I wouldn't want you to find something incomprehensible. When you call him give him my number. In any case, I'll pass by his office. Any news? Fine, thanks. We will connect it now. We put a BC-186 in the differential amplifier - Perfect. - There must be one in the middle of this mess. - Anna? - Yes? - Do you have the bolts and the nuts? - Yes. - Here. - Thanks. - Hi. - Are you there? Sure. Where would you want me to be? - Didn't you go to see the kids? - I can't go every day. I don't know why no one answers there. What can I say? Maybe they left. - All of them? - How do I know? - Do you know anything about Beppe? - I think everything he's fine. - When did you see him? - Some days ago. Do you know if Brusati checked her? I don't know. That's private, I think. - Tell him to call me tonight. - I don't know if I'll see him tonight. Maybe, I'll be in the office till late. Ok. Tell your secretary to reach them and tell them to call me. I'd like to know about Pietro, and how things are. Ok, bye. Greetings to Silvia. Internal communication: to leadership and heads of sections, divisions and services. In regards to the organization and training programs, we announce the registration for the residential seminar of intermediate ranks, will occur, this time, in the place indicated below, during the period of September 17 to 19. - I believe that is smart and useful. - For sure. I think there's a scheme there. Some excuse to fire people. The meetings will open on Monday. People are expected at the hotel until Sunday at 22, which can be reached by train, using the state railway. Good morning, Engineer. Do you think there is something behind all this? How would I know? It's said to be a pretext to fire people. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. Good Morning. - See you. - See you later. To have a commendable motive. You think they care about us? If they decide to ditch someone, they won't give explanations. - Take it for granted. - They'll do it easily. Restructuring, corporate reorganization... organizational chart rearrangement... You will see that we will all look for our name in the new lists. Like schoolchildren looking for their test scores. They never fired anyone. I don't think they'll do it. No, but they can create you problems so you give up. If you don't appear in the organization chart, you're out. They'll make you available. They'll leave you in your same position but you will no longer receive any communication. Nothing. Your colleagues will ignore you. Those who were your friends will avoid you, and if they see you they'll smile at you like someone who has a dead body in the house. Then, what do you do? You start to doubt, to ask yourself what did you do wrong, that maybe you made a mistake and you won't find answers. You'll ask yourself: why you. If you don't leave, you get crazy. I just need to endure a few years. Then I'll retire and I won't care anymore. - I don't think so. - What? That that is a solution. It's you! Hi. You arrived, Silvia! Fabrizio and Monica went for the others. They will arrive soon. Can you help me find a record? They always mess them up. There are flowers on the cover. Is it this one? Yes, it has a broken edge. - It's pink, isn't it? - Not pink, it's salmon. Women are very detailed with colors. - What is it? - Haydn. "Nocturne in F Major". - It's a bit ruined. - I hear it too much. Francesco! Giusti! I'm coming to you. How's the water? It should be at 20 degrees. Yes, rather cold. - Getting out already? - No. I just entered. But... what's on your mind? Cretin! Enough! What are you doing? You're pulling my hair! Hi little girl. You don't say hi to me? What's up? Are you angry! My God, what an ugly face. You're still angry with me? Come on, I didn't do you nothing. Silvia! There's a contract of sale on my desk. It's still a draft, it's not final. If I can, I'll pass tomorrow, I want to see how the farm is going. Tom! Where were you? I called you all afternoon. - Get me with Pietro, please. - Right away. Pietro, you went to the vet? Did they take the samples? Yes, but we still have time. You saw the mediator? There should already be an agreement, right? Tell him to hurry up. Every day money is spent uselessly. And you? Are you studying? Will you take an exam or will you keep wasting your time? - Dad is worried about you. - Worried why? Because you won't set your mind... Help! Let's cover him to put out the fire! Careful! Careful! Open the door! Come! Careful with his arms! That way! Madam, take the wheel, fast! Careful! Careful, please. Go. ...by revealing that there are treasures, the reader is taken to a fantasy world both passionate and captivating... - Is it far? - No. At most half an hour. Don't be late. I must pack my bags for tomorrow. We'll just eat something and say hello to the boys. - You're wealthy, I see. - No, no. This is not mine. - It's all from my wife. - But its a lot... She inherited it from her father, along with the notarial office. Why don't you quit and come to live here? I can't. All this cost a lot. A few years ago it was in ruins. My wife renewed everything. She transformed the agricultural farm into a livestock one. She does it as a hobby, with the office money. Also, there are things of great value. That bull, for instance, costs a lot of money. It's worth tens of millions. Not even men are worth that. - No. - Not even the leaders. Even less. - Rina, where's my light-colored suit? - Maybe in the closet. - I didn't see it. - I don't know, then. Maybe I lost it. - And your experiments? - Leave me alone. Tom is an ace at electronics. He built himself, under the cellar a small laboratory. He does things with his friends all day. But instead of studying, they invent strange devices, no one knows what for. - Though time passes and nothing comes. - Stop. Sure. And we, generations of serious men, what did we achieve? And what does it mean to do things seriously? For instance, when playing, everything's done with greater zeal, right? - Do you want? - No thanks. - And you? - I do. We'll have the coffee later, with Beppe. - Hello Dad. - Hi. Here is Beppe, and he is a colleague. Goodnight. You father was telling me... - And how's the bride? Hi. - Good evening. - You look good. - Yes Yes. Today your mother called me and blamed me for not knowing anything about you. She asked if you went to do the checkup with Brusati. No, but everything's fine. A coffee? Yes. That's the second reason for our visit. - Do you drink coffee also? - With pleasure. It's funny this atmosphere, like the "Far West", isn't it? It was a great enterprise to start building a house. You worked hard, the house looks great. Well, we didn't knew if we could do it. But it ended up being a real house. That's true. What's that? They look for frogs in the ponds. They come every night. - Have you ever tasted frogs? - No, no. There are people who like them. You can cook them fried, stewed... When will the baby be born? According to doctors in three months. Did you notice the resurgence of interest in religion? I don't think it's interest, rather a fear in society. However, part of the community doesn't believe in Christ, consider that. I mean, years ago, there were only old women in the churches. Today they're full of young people. - You discarded? - Yes, it's your turn. All right. How long will you stay? I don't know, maybe a few months. We have things to do. - Thank you. - It must have been terrible. You have no idea. Frightening. You don't know how the poor guy looked. I never saw injuries like that. Besides, he was just a boy. - Too short! - What a rascal! - It's the third time. - Well, but I have the jokers. You always get them! - Do you want an aspirin? - Thank you, I took one before leaving. If it had happened to me, I wouldn't have had the courage... - How was it? - I don't know, I didn't see anything. They loaded the wounded in my car and we went to the hospital. Laura, tomorrow we will take a ride on the boat. Do you want to come? Yes, with pleasure. It'll be like last year, we'll fish, we'll eat the fish... Or we'll fish only. It's the most important. Tommaso... Tommaso! Tommaso! Where the hell did he go? I wanted to tell him that we'll leave for a few days. Anyway, I'll call him tomorrow. Maybe they don't remember their crisis. In fact, neither do we. They are better apart. There may be a correlation... It's yours? Are you cold? I bet you were never with anyone. I thought so. Why so? It's always like that, the first time. You're always afraid. Right? Hey guys, when will the sun rise? In four minutes. It's the last time I'll come with you. No... Silvia! - Yes? - Where have you been? With Monica and the others, watching the sun rise. I don't like you returning at this hour. Okay. The management of the company will organize, periodically, meetings between the leaders of every level, in order to improve the operational structures of the company. - Welcome, Dr. Bellotti. - Good Morning. I'm arriving late. Here comes the boss. You all know that the situation is gradually getting worse. Not only in our company or in the country, but in all sectors of industry and in the world economy. The problem must be tackled urgently and it must be done in all its aspects. The productivity, the market, prices and management costs. A gray day, it seems. Gentlemen, the business game is a new teaching method. Through this "business game", literally translated, you can emulate the stages of a company's life. The fundamental choices, the programmatic decisions, with all the problematic relativity, adding in hours, several years of work. Groups of six are formed. Each is responsible for one direction: general, administrative, production... The members of each team must elect their president. Excuse me, with what criteria are the groups formed? - By lottery. - Thank you. We thought it was the best way. Don't you agree? I hope we all agree. Each group must acquire and run a hypothetical company in its transformation phase. The decisions of the groups will be transmitted by telephone to an electronic brain, connected to a series of terminals and according to mathematical models, it will reproduce the beginning, and the development variants. The business game will last 12 hours, divided into four modules. The 12 hours are equivalent to approximately three years of activity of the hypothetical company. - Which is ours? - The 105. It's like our classes. Yes, it seems the first day of school. 30 years of work and they send you to study. It's like playing with the toy soldiers. Rather the cat and the mouse game and not that of the toy soldiers. Look how beautiful. A room with a view of the lake. And now? Do we wait for the teacher? If you agree, let's define the positions. - Good. I write it down. - Perfect. I would like to propose a precise working method so that there are no problems. We could work in a group: solutions are proposed and discussed. I still think that positions must be defined. to have clarity in the end of the discussion. This way, personal merits can be distinguished. Let's decide who the CEO is, so we can order ourselves. I say it should be the oldest. We'll see that later... By the color of the hair, it must be me. - Okay. - I agree. - Do you agree? - For me it's ok. Since it's only a game. - Sorry, sister. - Please. How is the boy? - It's yet unknown, but he doesn't look good. - Did they call the parents? - Yes, but they haven't come yet. It seems they don't live here. Excuse me, something else... I found this medal in my car. It only has one date. It must be from the boy. - Thank you, I'll give it to him. - If you need anything, before his parents arrive... I think he just needs some praying. - What time is it? - I don't know. Come on let's go. - Do you have my lighter? - No. Who knows where I put it. - Hi! - Hi! You're here? I was close. She's Mimma. Come, greet them. - Hi. - Hi. - There's no signal. - Let's try removing the relay. Let's change it for another. He's an inventor. A "little brain." What are you doing? - A robot. - Really? - And does it walk? - No, it doesn't walk. No gestures... nothing human. - So what does it do? - It thinks. - Nothing else? - Don't you think it's enough? All robots are made to help men work. We, on the other hand, will make one to help men think. To think about what? You said it. It's a terrible question. Disturbing... I still don't understand, you know? The problem is that when understood it's no longer so beautiful. Come. I think they're kidding us. If you open a toy to see how it works you'll end up disappointed and with a broken toy. What does the tester mark? 15,000 Hey, I would need to do "one thing." - Now? - Yes. Excuse me, can I go to the bathroom? - You know where it is? - Yes Yes. I do. Come. Who are they? He says he works in advertising, and stuff. He's always with stupid girls. He's a ruffian. Drugs... a little of everything. Maybe even a thief. - And you trust him? - For him, I'm a friend. He needs me. It doesn't suit him to harm me. - What a place! - Yes. But... - Mimma. - Yes? Do you want to do it here? No. It looks like a church. It's not a bad idea. Mimma. Mimma! Come on, come here. - Who are they? - Who? - Those two. - Which two? Come on let's go... Mimma. - Silvia... Luisa... - Yes ma'am. I'm home. Silvia ate? Yes. Do you want to lunch? No. I'll just have a juice. I'm not hungry. First, respect the agreements. There's no need to explain it to them. Don't trust no one. Fortunately, there are no problems. If in two days they don't come to load, we'll choose others. Tell them clearly and without politeness. Ok? I would like news from the boy. Is there any hope? Thank God, he's better. - And his parents? - We don't know anything. - Take it to 27. - Okay. The police are looking for them. It seems that the mother lives abroad. They found the father. He was traveling with friends. They looked for him several days... How do you feel? Yesterday I brought you in my car. Poor kid. He complained all night. It's very hot in here. Yes. It's suffocating. If I can do anything to help you... Do you need anything? No. Don't cry. The nun has told me that your father will come soon. You'll see. Stay calm. It's alright now. This medal is yours, isn't it? - Yes. - I found it in my car. It's broken, but it can be fixed. It has only one date. Is it an important one? If you want I will fix it for you. Okay? Thank you. Excuse me, isn't there a cooler room? It's too hot in there. There are paid rooms. Check with the Administration department. - Do you have a mutualist? - No. - Can I write a check? - Yes, of course. ...it's the latest data. Good Morning. There is still no investment in machinery, right? Not to mention insecurity, nor the supply of inputs... Yes, it's true. First let's verify productive capacity and then we can see its connection with the market. It's important to have the finances controlled. Let's not forget the cost of money. It would be necessary to promote a meeting between CEO's or a representative, to reach an agreement on the attributions. Would you be so kind as to express yourself in understandable terms? Since we're not so updated. I didn't invent those terms, they are commonly used in this jargon. Not for me. I am a simple person, and I don't speak English. If possible, use familiar terms so we can all understand. Let's move on. Controversies contribute to nothing. I prepared a compendium of the situation, based on the market forecast. Excuse me, gentlemen. I have some bad news. In our game problems arise, as in reality. Unions are threatening with a strike if their demands are not met. I think they have acceptable demands. The representatives are willing to talk after their counter proposals are read. I will pick them up when they're ready. Even in our game there are imponderables. Gentlemen, see you later. What a clownery. Would you let me? Thank you. This ruins all programs. Let's see the conditions, maybe... - It's a spanner. - It's a lot of fantasy. It's planned in the game. It reproduces the stress of reality and checks the decision capacity. You seem well informed. I thought about it, before coming. It was the least I could do. What if we created a political body to reduce interests? I didn't think we would reach this point of stupidity. If it doesn't please you, you shouldn't complain to us. Please, let us work in peace, even if it's a clownery, as you say. It's a clownery! You should tell it to those who invited you here! - A question. - Yes? What guarantee do unions offer? We wouldn't want that in an hour that is in three months, there'd be more demands. All the guarantees until management is finished. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I would like another guarantee. That the members of the group do not show impatience or contempt. That would hinder the work of others. Thank you. What you said, in a sense, is part of the game. Behaviors of indifference, disbelief or contempt are very frequent in labour reality. Those are difficulties that arise and are dealt with each day. - I'd like you to focus your attention... - Excuse me. Excuse me. I would like to say something, if you let me. I believe that if the General Directorate organized this seminar it must have its good reasons. All I'm saying is that I really still don't understand what those are. Obviously, I belong to the past and what's happening today seems designed to destroy what we built before. Perhaps, that's the intention and it is understandable that discomfort occurs. Because, believe me, it's really humiliating for people, and for us who worked so many years with determination and sacrifice to reach the end of our career without understanding anything. I confess I don't grasp what we're doing here. I don't understand this game, its mechanisms, its words... I've been out for a long time and I've been struggling to realize what's happening. I read, I try to update myself I even signed up for an English course. And do not laugh, because I know many who did the same. Today, our administrative delegate said, in the introduction that the company, and not only ours but the entire economy is in crisis. It is sick. Moreover, if you allow me to say it, it's a corpse with makeup. And I, believe me, don't want to be part of this comedy. Silvia, hurry up. I have to go. I'm ready, sorry. Do I bring something to drink? No, nothing is missing. Better bring a coat. At night, it's cold at sea. Yes, that's better. We won't be back too late, right? Cause tomorrow I must leave. - And what will you do? - I don't know. They'll come for me. I'm ready. - Did you see how good these girls are? - They make you lose your mind. - Who am I going with? - With us. Let's leave them alone. - I forgot the cigarettes. - I have. Go ahead! Fabrizio, where are the others? - I'm waiting for them. - Don't be too late. Okay, okay. Don't leave Francesco alone! - Francesco, where is Fabrizio? - I don't know. He's always the same. What a jerk. Where do you want to go? I don't know. You made me suffer for a long time. You know? Didn't you like me? Tell me the truth. No, it's not that. So why? Why? And why did you want to? Because you are very pretty. And? Don't you sleep? Do you still feel bad? Not now. I just got an injection. Try to rest then. - It would do you good. - I can't. I can't stop thinking. About your parents? About many things. Good or bad? Things I never thought before. It happens, when you rest, that strange thoughts arise. I could have died. Don't say that. At night, everything seems worse. It was terrible, but it's finished. You are young, you will be well soon. Your little medal will be ready in a couple of days. It was a small thing. I saw that the date of the medal was very recent. Is it from your girlfriend? Yes. Is it from your first date? No. It's from a day when we were very happy and we made two equal medallions. That is so cute. It was a great love. "It was"? Has already finished? No. But we decided not to see each other during all summer. And why? To be safer. Although this year, summer never ends. Anna, the car is stuck in the mud. I can't leave the meadow. What will we do? Anna... - Take me up there. - Yes Yes. Careful. So you're still here? I thought you were already gone. Are you afraid of the storm? I fell asleep. Or you can't go back to your house? No. Where did you hide the car? I didn't see it. It's behind the silos. What will it be this time? Women's clothes or money? - Bullshit. - Look I don't want any problems... Damn! Don't be afraid, it's only a storm. It's like the end of the world. - Who knows? - How gloomy you are. Pietro! Pietro! Pietro! - What's going on? - It's Anna... I think the child will be born! Help me get the car out of the mud, with the tractor! Ok! Anna is going to have the baby, and I'm bogged down! - Pietro is coming with the tractor! - I'll take care of it, it will be faster! Come on, come with me! I go with the tractor! Tell Pietro to bring a rope! - Okay! - Hurry up! Tom went for the tractor! We need a rope! Come! Will find it there! Tom! Tom! Here's the rope! - Tie it up! - Give me the umbrella! - Do I tie it to the bumper? - Yes, like that it won't get loose! Hurry. He's turning it around! Did you tie it up? Backward! Come! Come on, get moving! Get in the car! Pass the rope over there! I'll tie the knot! Well, that should work! Tom! Tom! Call an ambulance! Tell them to come soon! Anna is not well! - We'll take her! - Anna is in danger! - I'm going upstairs! - Hurry up - We wait here? - I don't know, I think so! While I call bring the factor's wife. Go to my brother' place, cause Anna is about to give birth. - Where is it? - On the stairs behind the porch. Ma'am! - Ma'am! - What? Come quickly, Tom's sister-in-law is in labor! I'm going! It had to be tonight! Jesus Mary! She was expecting for later! The baby was to be born at the end of the month! Children, where do I go? To the little house behind the stable. Thank you and goodbye. I'm cold. Let's leave her alone so she can rest. I'll come by later. If you need me, call me. - And the child? - Don't worry. With the child it's simpler. If he cries, let him cry. If he bothers the mother, take him down, where there isn't much light. During the day, give him some water. Tomorrow we'll see. Mimma... Hi! What? - I said hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Beppe's wife had a baby tonight. Excuse me doctor, for disturbing you at night. Don't worry! I'm used to it. It's normal for me. Children are almost always born at dawn. - Even on holidays. - How boring. It is. But there are lot of nice patients with a lot of will to live. That is an advantage. - Did you tell your mother? - I'll call her later. I advise you to be gentle. It's a shock to be such a young grandmother. Tell her to call me at the clinic. I'll be there all morning. - Okay. - You know what your mother is like. She'll want to know all. Better tell her everything. Tell her to relax, that everything went well. - It was a big confusion. - We exaggerated. Bringing a child to the world is quite normal. Nature is perfect. Though we forget it. It's a sign that we're losing faith in life. Can I know what's this, spending the night out? You know I don't like it, even if you are with known people. Rest a little, we must leave. We leave? Yes, we return home. Anna had the child, tonight. - And what do I have to do with it? - What do you have to do with it? It doesn't look good if you don't go. Besides, I'm going and you come with me. Sleep now. At 9:00 we leave. I want to arrive for breakfast. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good Morning. Is it possible to repair this chain right away? No problem. I'll be out for a couple of days. If you need, let me know. So what would you want to do? Stay here, at home or elsewhere? Why? Because next week I'll reopen the studio, but first I must close the sea house. Don't know why, I prefer to stay alone. Not even in my dreams. If you want to stay at the sea, you can be Prandoni's guest. I don't want to. But... aren't they your friends? I don't like being a guest. Though you were there all summer, morning till night. - Unload the bags. - Ok. I'm going to Beppe's. Beppe... Beppe? What are you doing there? Repairing the bed. - How is Anna? - She's well. - And the kid? - Also. So pretty! They're ugly, the newborns. - Don't be such a fool. - You should see him at night. - How much does he weigh? - We didn't weigh him yet. How didn't you weigh him yet? Isn't there a nurse or someone...? - I don't know. - You don't know? Brusati didn't send anyone? He said he would be back this afternoon. And then? He has forgot it. There must be someone to take care of the baby. There was Rina, the factor's wife. Ok, but you can't leave the child to the factor's wife. - Anna sleeps? - No, I don't think so. - Anna dear, how are you? - Good. Did it happen suddenly? Yesterday we read until late. Everything was quiet. Before we went to bed, we removed the sheets. Oh dear! You did very well, dear. - Were you afraid? - No. There was a terrible storm. There was no light, and the car didn't start. - Did you do everything alone? - Luckily there was Pietro. Otherwise... I don't know. I was overwhelmed. - How unwise! - Soon came Tom and his friends. You're crazy. Here alone and without a phone. This house is picturesque, but if a strong wind comes I don't know what can happen. If it resisted this storm, what else can we ask for? But it is convenient that you move to the house. Especially for the kid. I can give you my room. It's big. You'll be comfortable. What do you think? We're fine here. Well... If you were alone it could be even fun. But being with the child, it seems imprudent. - Why? - Don't be insensible, please. Also for those who will come to visit. To see them staying so precariously... Don't you think dear? Don't worry. We already organize everything. Besides, we're fine here. - Good evening Madam. - Good evening. - I typed the draft. - Good. Bring the minutes of Dr. Minari. I said already that I don't want you to eat secretly while working. If you're young and hungry and you can't avoid it, you go and eat in the bathroom. - Where did you go? To the sea? - Yes. - Was it good? - Quite. In the last day it rained. ...and group 5 with -1,143,194,600. Last, group 6 with -1,291,119,600. The only team that closed positive was number 2 with more than 700 million. Gentlemen, I don't want to tarnish the enthusiasm of the winning group. But, as we said at the beginning the goal of the game is didactic, not competitive. Tomorrow we will dedicate ourselves to carefully analyze this experience confronting the different decisions of the groups during the three months of simulated management. Yes I know. But I can't just leave everything and leave. It's a delicate moment. It's hard to explain. I'll try to leave before or after dinner. I don't know. I must see how things are, here. The key to my room, please. - At what time tomorrow? - 9:30. But tonight we should meet and organize... - Tonight I must go home. - My son was a father. - Congratulations. - Don't say that, now I'm a grandfather. - Sooner or later it happens to us all. I'll be back in the morning. I leave my things in the room. Yes? I'm leaving, but I'll be back tonight, or early tomorrow. At least, I must be present. Say hello and tell them... It's not the right time to leave. But what I can do? ...tell them I'm happy for them, and I admire them. He had to be born just now. He just arrived in the world and already annoys everyone. I don't know because I'm single, but it must be very special to have a son. Well... at that age it's a foolishness. If not, how would children come to the world? - See you tomorrow. - See you. Well, it's a moment of big confusion, of general disturbance. - You drink coffee, don't you? - Thank you. - Rina... - Yes? - Can you get us four coffees? - Yes ma'am. Sorry, you were saying? That the things we wanted so much did not go as we expected. We work like crazy, we sacrifice ourselves for nothing... and today we find ourselves empty-handed. What do these people want? I think they don't even know it. Yes? Who is it? Excuse me. Wait a moment, I can't hear anything. - Yes? - Hi Silvia. Don't you recognize me? Ah! Hi. What's that? Am I a stranger? - When did you come back? - We just arrived. And why didn't you call me? I would have liked it. - I didn't know if you were there. - You could try. - What's wrong? - Nothing. What happened to you? Tell me the truth. - Nothing! - So why did you come back? I'm here with my mother. My sister-in-law had a baby. - Do you stay a few days? - No. We leave tomorrow. - I want to see you. - Better not. - Silvia, let's see the kid. - Okay, I'm going. - Hurry up. - Okay! - Why don't you want to see me? - Please. I prefer it that way. - Silvia! - Anyway, I'll call you tomorrow. - I'm coming to see you. - No. - Why? - No reason. I don't want to. Why don't you want to see me? Do you still have my watch? I kept my word. What about you? You didn't, did you? But why? Do you think I don't love you? Hug me. Hug me please. What's happening? Don't you sleep? Are you worried about the boys? No. They're fine... Don't you think? About the baptism, I would say to wait a while. Everyone is traveling, I mean, those that interest us. By the way, Bellotti was appointed administrative delegate. Really? More than a month ago. Lately there have been many replacements. It's a difficult situation. It seems they are planning to reduce staff. Several leaders were waived off. Some have already resigned not to suffer the humiliation of being dismissed overnight. Just think what this came to: someone came from vacation and found his office empty. While he was away, they dismantled everything and put someone else there. - They went that far? They're not going easy on people. It was predictable. They couldn't go on like this. Are you still friends with Bellotti's wife? Yes, quite a lot. Then, if you can, call her. You can use the excuse of the child's birth. Because, in the end, it's Bellotti who decides everything. - Silvia... - Yes? - Are you awake? - I am. What did you decide? Do you stay or come with me? You're wearing my shirt. Sorry, this place is a mess. I put on the first thing I saw. Though it suits you. I'm going to the office. If you decide to come, call me there. See you later. Gentlemen, before starting the discussion and the corresponding examinations of what motivated the programmatic decisions of each group, I would like to talk about some aspects of our first game. I'm sure you noticed the importance of team work. Some of you noticed how the teams were randomized formed in addition to the lack of time, which prevents efficiency. - This work experience... - What happened? Palmieri left. He quit. Left the society. Yesterday, management signed the new organizational charts. They say when we return, we'll find great changes. There will be many empty offices. Each decision is made with anxiety and apprehension. And so it was in our game, even if it was a simulated reality. Excuse me, madam. I'm looking for Tommaso. He's still sleeping. - Do you need something urgently? - I'm friends with him. I don't know when he'll wake up. It's better to pass by later. - And the baby, how is he? - The baby? - Why? - We were with him that night. We gave a hand. We did what we could. Well, I'll wait here anyhow. I believe it was better for you to return another day. Thank you... His father came. He arrived this morning and wanted to take him at all costs. In these conditions? He's crazy. There was no need to transport him with cranial trauma. But, before his father's decision... Don't you know where he is? No, but we can ask his doctor. No, it doesn't matter. By the way, the father paid the expenses. - If you go to the Administration department... - No thanks. - The Administration department can't... - Do what you think is best. Okay. The fire broke out this morning at the end of a party. Firefighters fought several hours before controlling the flames. The cause of the fire in the hotel built two years ago is still unknown. Did you made the call to Dr. Bellotti's wife? Sorry, I completely forgot. I had too many things to do. Try to do it tomorrow. You would do me a great favor. No problem. - Good Morning. - Dr. Belotti called me. - It seemed urgent. - Come, I'll let him know. - Please wait. - Thank you. Dr. Rancalli is here for the president. Ok, ok. - Good morning, lawyer. - Good Morning. - It's cold, isn't it? - Yes. And a little wet. He's busy now. Let's try his secretary I think there is a communication for you. - Miss, the Engineer is here. - Yes, come in, please. Excuse me, the doctor's wife sent this package for your wife. Would you mind delivering it? It's because of the birth. Yes, thanks. Thank the lady, please. My wife will call her later to thank her. - Okay. - See you later, miss. See you later, Engineer. The year 1973, on September 24, in Milan, Margoni Street 29 before me, Dr. Laura Riberti notary enrolled in the Milan's Notary Association, appear the gentlemen: Giuseppe Torti, born in Brescia on July 18, 1896 residing in Milan, Cardiani Street 29, owner... Can you give me a light? Thank you. Next week, we'll open the house and stay in the city. In this time, it's not worthy to come out every night. And you? This year, will you study or will you keep wasting time with your suff? - Stuff, you say. - Stuff, if made that way. - It's the only thing that interests me. Good answer. I just want to say that each one has his own concept of utility, different from the others. THE CIRCUMSTANCE
