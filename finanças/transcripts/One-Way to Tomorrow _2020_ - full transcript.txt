NETFLIX PRESENTS EVERYTHING IN THIS STORY IS FICTIONAL. TO PEMRA... ADAPTED FROM DRAZEN KULJANIN'S MOVIE HUR MAN STOPPAR ETT BRÖLLOP PART ONE Excuse me. I think that's my seat. Here you go. They often make mistakes. -I wonder if that was it? -Yeah. Sometimes they sell the same seat twice, maybe... It was empty, so I took it because I didn't want to go backwards. Hello? Gözde, I got on. I got on. I'm on the train. On the Blue Train. I don't know. I guess someone stole it. It's all gone. I guess I'll just go to the wedding nude now, Gözde. I don't know. I'll figure it out when I get off. I'll do it when I get off. Gözde, do you think your clothes will fit me? Geez, you're just like my mom. Stop the nonsense. Gözde, sweetheart, I told you. I don't know who stole it. All right. I don't know who stole it. Talk to you later. All right. Bye. Sorry to hear what happened. Your luggage is gone... Were you eavesdropping? It's hard not to. I was just curious about something. What's your seat number? It's three. Is that okay? Three? Is three all right? Don't get me wrong, but that's also my seat. -My friend's seat actually -What the hell? But, it's okay. No problem. They're not coming. I have to be in Izmir by tomorrow night and the train is full. Is that good enough? What? I have to be in Izmir tomorrow and the train's full. Is that good enough? Can we just leave it at that? Then I should just forgive you. What do you mean? You know how you got upset, "What the hell?" and all. I'm just saying, I guess I should forgive you. Well, yes... I had a bad day. Your luggage is gone. Yep. -And you can't go backwards. -Why are you dwelling on this? Why do you think? Okay, look, can I go to Izmir in here or not? That's the question. The answer should be that clear, right? No, I mean... You obviously can. But am I allowed to stay or not? That's the real question. I don't understand. I mean, you have this attitude... What attitude? Good evening. -Good evening. -Can I have your names? Ali Kaynar. Kaynar... Ali Kaynar. Okay. And yours? Kavak. Kavak. I don't have anyone by that name. I made a mistake and bought my ticket for tomorrow. Ayhan Adalı. Type it, sir. Ayhan Adalı. Ayhan Adalı. Yes. The lady is Mr. Ayhan Adalı? How can she be Mr. Ayhan, sir? What's your name? Mehmet. Mr. Mehmet, I bought this compartment with my friends. Four of us. Check the names. Seyhan. Rasim. Ayhan. See? It's our compartment anyway. My friends couldn't make it. Are you married? We're engaged, sir. Because a man and woman are not allowed to travel like this. Sir, she didn't let us go to Izmir, man to man. She got all uneasy. The system wouldn't have worked with a woman's name. What can we do, sir? I have to issue a fine to the lady. That's okay. How much is the fine? It's going to be about 85 liras. Let me check. Okay, go ahead. Write up the fine. -89,50 liras. -Here you go. Here you go. Thanks. Have a good trip. So, what attitude do I have? Like, "Even if I don't explain myself, people will understand..." -Really? -That's the image so far. What was the point of buying four tickets? Is that the type a person you think I am? The type of person who would buy four tickets so he could travel alone in the train? I don't know what to think. -My friends were supposed to be here. -So they ditched you? They couldn't make it. You should've canceled then. People with emergencies couldn't get tickets! They should take a plane. Who'd take the train? It's a ten-hour trip. Maybe they're afraid of flying. They should get a bus, then. Maybe their luggage got stolen at the terminal. What's about getting on a train without a ticket? I have a ticket... For tomorrow. -What do you mean? Should I leave? -You already tried that. -What is it that you want? -Maybe a "Thank you"? Thank you. You're welcome. Unfortunately, I have bad news. I can't go backwards, either. No problem. I'll manage. By the way, I'm Ali. -What? -I'm Ali. It's a pleasure. -My stomach... -Are you okay? PART TWO Let me help you. -Let's keep you out of this now. -Good thing it didn't get on your clothes. Good evening Ms. Şebnem. I looked at it. Actually, I left it on your desk. Well... Rather than the GSM operator, the guy is at fault here. He builds a cell tower and makes it look like a water tank. Puts it on the roof with the sign "water tank." The pictures are in the folder. Someone took them from the roof across the street. You can see the cables... It's obvious it's a cell tower. Exactly. That's what I wrote in the petition. Okay. I'm on my way now. My friend's wedding. We'll see. Okay. Have a good evening, Ms. Şebnem. So, a guy puts up a cell tower and covers it up as a water tank? Yes. The whole neighborhood's rising up. They have tree-shaped ones too. Don't even know if it's causing any harm or not. Are you a lawyer? For now. Is the smell gone? I didn't smell it when I came back. This is awful. Sorry. Don't be. It's clear you shouldn't travel backwards. "Before you embark on a journey of revenge, also dig a second grave for yourself." I bought it, but I didn't like it. -Just wanted to see whose book it is. -It's mine. -Are we still in primary school? -No. And that's why we don't go through each other's bags, right? "Good day, sir! I'd like to get revenge." "Here, we have a written one." I didn't read it, though. How about all the notes and writing? I got it from a secondhand store. Why did you get revenge from the poor secondhand store? Are all these jokes from law school? Nope. All mine. Not getting a perverted vibe here. I might think you're hitting on me. Still not sure. It's strange. Just asking. Because you're a lawyer? Just making conversation. Well, what for? I'm curious. Most people are not curious. But I am. Like, I'm curious about why you're here. What's the deal? But you don't stop there. -What do you mean? -You ask a lot of questions. But it's not easy. It takes listening. Well, naturally. People don't do that either. They don't listen. We have so many flaws, right? There might be less flaws if we listened. We're in the same compartment on a 14-hour trip. Who am I? What am I? Am I some kind of pervert? Don't you want to know anything about me? You're Ali. You gave me a seat. Thanks. You're a lawyer. You friends didn't come. Going to a wedding. -Wedding? -That's what you said on the phone. -You totally eavesdropped. -I overheard it. Also, it's kind of obvious. Your suit and all. And you pretend you're not curious. Why do you hide it? Just ask. I even wonder about someone in front of me at the bank. -You just go up to them and ask? -Depends. Do they drink tea or coffee? Do they... like warm sea waters or cold? -Do they squeeze lemon on fish? -You can't do that. Right? You see that? Start of a conversation. Do you have to have a conversation? I get bored. Which is better: a fantastic chicken döner or a mediocre beef döner? Can we not talk about street food? Go to Anamur with your boyfriend or Paris with your friend? You're always like this? I could ask something else. What did you lose in the luggage? Don't remind me. Everything. Everything. It wouldn't fit. I mean, how could everything fit in a piece of luggage? Also, not everything is gone. You have your bag. You have your music. If that was gone too, I'd kill myself. It's an 89-year-old violin. Sometimes it's good to lose everything. Like, when you move. You get rid of useless things. What's in your bag? The usual stuff. What if it gets stolen here? I would hardly miss anything. So why do you carry it, right? I guess you have a point. There is no limit to curiosity, then? -Maritime Law. -What I'm studying. Why? You're a fish out of water? Cemal Süreya. -Two books! -I like reading him. We have a drug warehouse. Red glasses. Prescription glasses. Would you like one? We have ten hours. How else are we going to pass time? That's your deal? You hop on the train, get all high on drugs and party? -What are those? -Hüseyin. The pills, I mean. -It's Hüseyin. -Who's Hüseyin? Hüseyin is the pill. Everything's Gonna Be Great? You know, it was in the movie. The pill. Hüseyin. "Whose name is Hüseyin?" "The pill is named Hüseyin." You didn't see Everything's Gonna Be Great? What does this Hüseyin do? -It's heart medication. -You have a broken heart? Hüseyin is my doctor. What if I had taken it? There is no "Why are you taking heart medication?" No "Get well soon." Only "What if I had taken it?" But I did ask. I asked if you had a broken heart. I had a heart attack when I was 14. A heart attack happens at that age? You have a heart at every age. What are you doing? I guess I can't hear it from here. Ticktock? -Not everyone knows that. -My grandma has it. I don't have a pacemaker. Mine is different. I used to hear it every time I hugged her. It's a strange feeling. Shit. -Fuck. -What? What is it? Her pills were in the luggage. They're gone, too. Damn. My sister brought them from the USA. They dissolve in the intestines or something. -Is she ill? -No. So, why are you in a rush to get to Izmir? I'm going to a wedding too. -Is it a surprise wedding? -What do you mean? You said you had to go to a wedding. Didn't you know where and when? Just a figure of speech. You know how I got on the train last minute and all. What if it's the same wedding? Whose is it? It's none of your business? You know I'm going to a wedding too. That's why. Just a friend's wedding. Where? Is it in Izmir? Nope. Where's yours? In Urla. The bride's side? -I'm not even invited. -Well, then... My ex is getting married. I wish them all the best. -She's making a mistake. -What can she do? -She should change her mind. -And then? -She should come back to me. -Wow! Because I'm the one who truly loves her. Not the prick she's about to marry. So you're crashing the wedding? You're exaggerating. So you're just going to watch from a distance? I have things to say to the bride. Like what? "Don't get married"? "Be with me"? What are you going to say? That I have two weeks to live. She's getting married out of spite. She's making a mistake. You're going to kidnap the bride. There's no kidnapping. I can't miss something like this. Give me the address so I can come. Ortaköy Resort. Ortaköy Resort. Are those really heart meds? And I'm Leyla. Imagine if I threw up too? So, are you serious? About what? About having two weeks left? Not really. But we can never know, right? It could happen. PART THREE By the request you made to our office, you asked to get married. We have examined your documents and found no legal reason for you not to get married. Now I would like you to repeat that you want to get married in the presence of the witness and guests. Now, Ms. Müjde Ar, with no pressure from anyone and no influence from anyone, with your own will, do you accept marrying your fiancé, Şener Şen? -I do. -No! -Dad! -Wait. Stop this wedding. What are you going to offer this time, you bastard? No, son. This marriage cannot happen. You can't stop us anymore. I'm not the one stopping you, my daughter. -It's God. -What do you mean? You can never get married. Because... You're brother and sister. -You think of something like this, right? -Naturally. What would you like? I think we should get some Raki for my friend. I'm afraid it's prohibited to serve alcohol on trains. I'd like a cup of coffee. -And Turkish coffee for me. -We only have instant coffee. How can you not have Turkish coffee? -The machine's broken. -Why not use a coffee pot? We're getting one coffee for the lady too. Two cups of coffee: one black, one white. I don't want it. None for me. I'll just have some water. One black, then. -Why did you assume I take milk in mine? -Just took a guess. So, where did you meet this girl? Are you always like this? You talk to people like you're scolding them. Where? In Urla. At my aunt's summer house. Summer love. No, fall. -I had an interview for a job. -In Urla? There are no lawyers in Urla? Do lawyers look for jobs? There is a Technopark in Urla. One of the companies there was looking for a lawyer for their legal department. You know, I had just graduated. -I see. And then? -I applied, went to Urla... My aunt has a house there. Then I applied for the interview. I went there. Then... I went there. Then, they hired me. So I started working... How did you meet the girl? -Should we talk about something else? -Like what? I don't know. Isn't this weird? Why am I talking about it now? It's a good topic. What else can we talk about? How did your love begin? Here you go. "How did your love begin?" What do you mean, "How did your love begin?" Why don't you ask how it went instead of how it began? It seems yours didn't go anywhere, that's why. -That's the point. -What? People think love just happens instantly. They think love is about the beginning. No one's... interested in maintaining the love. All right. I believe love is something you can succeed at. -And you're unsuccessful? -Maybe I am. But it's something you can learn. Then tell me whichever part of this romance you want to tell. I mean, if I can't ask you how your love started, -tell me what kind of person she is. -Why do you want to know? It's exactly what you do. I got curious, so I started a conversation. What's she like? "What's she like?" She's... Golden. She's well-educated, you know... She was staying at the resort. I... My aunt knew her family. I had heard about her before. Totally arranged, then. I totally arranged to see her by the pool... -That's where you fell for her. -No. That's where she caught my eye. -Are you like that? -How? You instantly fall for them, like bang! You never know, maybe... -She caught your eye. Then? -Yes. She's the type that draws attention. -What's her name? -Burcu. -Burcu what? -Burcu Sunay. I mean, what's her zodiac sign? Scorpio. Oh, boy! -What's your sign? -Leo. That's my mom's sign too. A bit headstrong, right? -Who? -Leos. Depends on the situation. Yes. What kind of person is Burcu? There's something different about Burcu. You'd understand if you met her. It's something special. You know the type of person. I don't. What type? You know... The one that... The most popular kid in school. Everyone's favorite person. Always on a high, always cheerful. But not fake, all real. Is that possible? Always on a high, always real? Burcu is. Leo. You saw her by the pool. Then? We should just drop this completely. You met, she's on a high, real. Then? -Then we started dating. I checked. -Checked what? -To see if it would work. -So you're making calculations? Kind of like that. I never do anything on the fly. Where's love in all this? Right in the middle. -In everything she had me do. -Like? -I'm not even invited and-- -Okay. What else? I quit my job. You got the girl. The job? So what. When you put it that way, it sounds stupid but... You can call it fate. Fate? Like, destiny? What are we even talking about? In the final analysis, Burcu is not getting married willingly. Your confidence is through the roof. Are you married? If I were, I wouldn't have the ring on my right hand. Why did you ask? I didn't want to be on the defense. Where are you heading to? What's your deal? Mine is obvious now. Mine? I got nothing. Is that possible? What are your expectations, really? That she'll decide not to marry the guy? The wedding-- -Aren't you bored? -I'm curious about your expectations. I guess we could take a break. You were saying, "14-hour ride. How do we spend the time?" Would you like something? What are you thinking now? Nothing. Impossible. The world record is three seconds. -What record? -The World Record for Thinking Nothing. How do they measure it? With a stopwatch. I really wasn't thinking about anything. -I don't have any expectations. -There. You were thinking. I'll just go and tell her how I feel. She will come or she won't. Don't try to make it sound all innocent. You're literally going there to crash the wedding, with the drama involved. Can we not say "crash the wedding"? Why? Is it illegal to kidnap a girl? Look at you! You should have been a lawyer, too. -Can I ask you something? -Yes, madam prosecutor? Really, how will you do it? How will you trick her? I don't need to. I will talk to her just as one should. But how? Is there gonna be a show? Or will you just go and talk to her directly? Head on? -Forget about it. -I mean, the microphone stand and all? -Let it go. -Come on. Are you being shy? You don't have to know it all. Who knows? Maybe you'll cut your wrists after the wedding. You're not telling so you won't jinx it? Okay. Have any cigarettes? I don't smoke. Excuse me, can I borrow a cigarette? Thanks. Need anything, sir? We're closing. No. How much do I owe you? I need to check. Go ahead. PART FOUR I'll tell you if you'll listen properly. Yes, come in. So what is it? That seat you're sitting in? My friends were supposed to be here, but they didn't make it. We were supposed to be on the way to Izmir together, with food, booze, and music. Those guys have a band. A music band. We were going to hold a pirate concert at the wedding. Where and how was all decided. Just before they say "I do," I was supposed to-- What is it? I'm listening. But those deserters didn't show. Excuses like "Why are we going by train? Why can't we fly?" They released two albums. Now they're big shots. Burcu loves Cemal Süreya. So do I. Poetry. Like poetry poetry. Not just any kind of poetry. Let's go. "You, liquid mirror, suffering insect. Nutritious stain on my laundry. The only legible part of my destiny. Fearless happiness, solid anger. You... Red onion who swallowed its uvula. Big-hearted acacia. A skirt with its thread pulled. With a little belly. -You. Elisürencil." -"You. Elisürencil." "If there is a word like that, that's the one. I'm sorry about yesterday. You just got off work. You're in Beşiktaş. Who wouldn't want to be happy? Are you also willing to be unhappy?" Right there, Burcu was getting goosebumps, right, my dear Ali? Burcu has never read any poems in her life, Ali. She thinks Süreya is a pub! I read her his poem! I'm the one who loves poems, Cemal Süreya, likes to eat crumpets cream in Afyon. -What? -Dumbass Burcu would laugh her ass off at this. What do you think will happen? You really think she'll dump that jerk Berke and run into your arms? You think she has the capacity to get your love and affection? Your poetry and all that crap? Do you think Burcu deserves you going there to beg? Who the hell are you? What made you fall desperately in love with her? Her ass like a washbowl... or her slightly slanted eyes? She left you for an idiotic egoist and now she's getting married to him! Go and read your poem. Let's see what happens. -Burcu sent you? -That's what you'd have hoped for? Tell me the truth, did Burcu send you? Or that faggot Rasim? Rasim? Burcu? You and I ran into each other by accident. You're so full of yourself. So full of yourself. Call Burcu. Tell her I'm not coming. So you just give up? What are you doing? Ali. You had me tell you everything. Like an idiot. Ali. Ali. Look, I'm serious. It was really a coincidence. I have nothing to do with your stuff. I know, I should've told you from the beginning. You were talking about a wedding. I just couldn't interrupt. Then we had a conversation going. Okay, I'm sorry. How could I know that you-- God, what are you doing getting off here? -What are you going to do? -Get back. I think you should go back. And why do you take me so seriously? You got your thing going. What difference does it make if I know Burcu or not? Ali! -Two beers, sir. -It's past the legal time. Sir, please, can you just give them to me? We're going to get six, sir. And two whiskeys. I have stuff to say as well. Ali, the train is about to leave, come on. My bag is on it. Please. Are you chickening out? You run for the hills first chance you get. Keep the change. Is that why you didn't take the plane? There are no stops. What are you going to do? Jump out with a parachute? Ali! What do you think you're doing? Ali, don't be ridiculous. The train's about to leave. My bag is on it. And maybe it will end well. What's that again? Everything's gonna be great? You're not gonna listen to me? Come on. Ali, the train's leaving. -Ali! -You should run. I don't want them to get married either! Okay? Fuck. Damn it. I don't want them to get married either. I was with that jerk Berke for six years. Do you understand now? Why I didn't say anything? My violin's gone. Get in. Come on, we're catching it. Come on, the violin is slipping away. PART FIVE We were together for six years. Six years. And do you know what he always used to tell me? He used to say "I will never get married, girl." He didn't see the point in getting married. One morning, I left his place, went to my own apartment, took my shower. Doorbell rang. A courier. He gives me a package. I opened it and I saw a wedding invitation. What? "Burcu and Berke are inviting you to..." -You guys were still together? -I told you, the morning I left his place. He sends you a wedding invitation the same day? Are you not listening? Burcu sent the invitation. Otherwise, I wouldn't have known they were getting married. Holy crap! You didn't get to know her well. Is it possible that you threw a corkscrew at this dumbass's head? It didn't hit him in the head. Of course. The eye, right? It fell in front of him. I didn't even throw it. That's not what I heard though. So you're Violinist Leyla. What did you hear? Well, you had a huge fight. You almost poked his eye out. Burcu told me. And I guess you crashed the car into a wall once? -I don't remember anything like that. -How come? I just don't. If it's useless, I just erase it. I thought people were making it up. So you really crashed the car. I don't remember anything like that. You're both in the car. You crash it and you forget it. How does that work? Somehow my brain erases it if it wants to. You have a delete button? Hit the button and forget. I wish I were like that. What else do you know about me? Why are you going to the wedding? What do you actually expect? I don't expect anything anymore. I don't even have a dress. So maybe I won't. And you should go and read your poem, and see what happens? You still haven't told me what you expect. Actually, I wasn't going to go. But later, it hit me. I want them both to know. I don't give a fuck about them. So you're just going to make an appearance? I want to be there for a change. See their faces. See what's it like to be there and see those two get married. You still have a chance to change Berke's mind. And you think you still have a chance with the girl. Good for you, man! You'll go there, read your poem, and get the girl? Really, good for you. I'll have to think of something else. Seems she doesn't like poetry. It's a whole new game now. In this day and age... Bravo, brother. My cousin kidnapped a girl from her wedding as well. No kidnapping here, brother. That's okay. They'll charge you with detaining. No, they won't. But that's what it is. If you detain someone, that's what you'll be charged. If the girl isn't underage and is willing, nothing will happen. He thinks the girl will come of her own will. How did the cousin and the girl turn out? Did they get married? My cousin is still in prison. I have no idea what happened to the girl. They say she moved to Denizli, but who knows. How about Turgut Uyar? -What about him? -Do you like him? I like him too. But I like him, Ali. Me. PART SIX Keep the change! The violin is here. The violin. My back is killing me. Look! The Maritime Law is here. You came back for The Maritime Law? So you don't kill yourself. For the violin. How come we've never met before? Why do you think? Actually, I barely hung out with Burcu's friends. How long were you guys together? Approximately two years. In that "approximately two years" how many times did you see her? A lot. I was careful. What does "a lot" mean? You followed her to Istanbul? Yeah. Then? Then Burcu decides... that she wants to go on a world tour or tour Europe by train. But you? I had to work. I thought you quit your job for the girl. You tell me, know-it-all. Maybe not everything... Unfortunately, I know quite a lot, but never mind. Why? You didn't erase those? Just tell me. Never mind. Just tell me what you know. Well, I'm getting firsthand information on this trip. -What are you learning? -That you are a little aggressive. She told you that? Nope. I'm seeing it for myself. Also, the corkscrew story. And we have a forgotten car-crash story. -There we go, the same story. -Then you tell me so I can find out. You really want to know? Let me tell you. Where did Burcu... stay in Milan, my dear Ali? You do know. Where did she stay in Milan those two months? How were things between you? It was good... I mean it was all right. Where did Berke and Burcu meet, my dear Ali? -They're old friends. -Nope. That's what you think. Burcu and Berke met in Milan. Two days later, Burcu stayed at Berke's place. At that time, we... You were together, right? That's what I thought. I thought Burcu was my friend. I thought Berke was my boyfriend. I was thinking, "How nice. Burcu won't be alone." But Burcu... took care of the business there, and once back in Istanbul, they secretly kept it going. You get it now? Neither of them told us anything. That's why I say the girl is in love with an asshole. She's getting married to a dick, and following that dick, that asshole, and you're here... Where is this button? You know, the delete button that makes you forget? Can I forget what you told me tonight? Is this the button? Easy. Why did you tell me? To make me give up? You asked me to. And I didn't want to hide anything anymore. Invite me to your wedding, my darling I can be your witness... See? It's your song. If anyone asks "Who is this guy?" It goes well with whiskey. You'll say "He's an old acquaintance" Invite me to your wedding, my darling I can be your witness if you want If anyone asks "Who is this guy?" You'll say... What are you doing? ..."He's an old acquaintance" Let's drink. We had such dreams years ago... Perfect timing. Here. This is your song. Three, four. The ones that love, the ones that leave I gave up everything Thanks to you All my love is the talk of the town So this is what they call the song of love I will neither burn down the world Nor break the glasses Thanks to you all I no longer believe in love What they call love is a burnout, boy I am not laughing nor getting mad Nor am I crying after her Thanks to you all My heart is vexed with love I am tired of whoring hearts Neither deep as the ocean Nor calm as the sky Thanks to you all The ideas turned upside down I am now afraid of the cogwheels turning Come on Oh, god Why do I always come to you When I'm troubled? Oh, god Thanks to you all, I am always sighing Oh, god Why do I always come to you When I'm troubled? Oh, god Thanks to you all, I consumed love Thanks to you all, I lost myself Thanks to you all, I lost myself Last time Nay-rina-nari-nirinom Thanks to you all "Nay, rina, nari, nirinom." Nice words. "Nay, rina, nari, nirinom." Exactly. Okay, this one's for you, then. PART SEVEN -Hello? What's going on, Mr. Lawyer? -Rasim? -What's going on? You there? -One question, one answer. What is it? You know your junior-high buddy, the prick Berke. Bro, he's not my buddy. Rasim, did these two, him and Burcu, screw me over in Milan? Come on, Mr. Lawyer. Did you know, Rasim? Bro. -Hello. -I'm here. Did you know, Rasim? Man, it was me who told you not to go, right? Hang up, bro. We'll talk later. Things are different there-- Holy cow! I turned out to be the lonesome guy who got four tickets. I had no idea. Do you know why I got on this train? I wanted something to happen. Nothing's happened for a while. For a very long while. Maybe since my heart attack. Growing up, my parents always used to say, "Don't do this, don't do that. You'll die." So I grew up very early. And, maybe, I died too early. Doing the right thing, thinking about death all the time, I feel like I'm going to implode. And Burcu was really the only thing that happened in my life. And everything other than her... I made it happen, saying, "This is the right thing." Not because I wanted it willingly... Did anything I wanted ever happen? No. I mean... And when I want it, I go read poems, like a child. I mean, you-- It's completely fine. You know, you jeered me. "A child reading poetry, going to the wedding to read poetry." Yes, he's a child and he's going. Because I thought something would happen with Burcu. Because I wanted that. I wanted to go back to the days when I was with Burcu. I said "Okay, I'll be a restaurateur or a cook." But now, I know. I don't want to. Keep being a lawyer. Calling those jerks my friends. Going back. There are so many things I don't want now. It's not good to want something so badly, you know? If you do that, then, you think life is all about that. I mean, someone with only a hammer in their hand sees everything like a nail. For example, our conservatory is just like that. We start as a kid, because it's what you want as a kid. Or it's what your mom wants the most. For you to be a pianist, a dancer, a violinist. Or maybe there's a show on TV, where everyone's famous and successful, everyone's a pianist. Anyway, you start school, you're a kid. What happens next? You grow up. All of a sudden, you're someone else. You don't feel like playing the violin. That happened to you? Of course, kind of. For a while, I wanted to a be a surfer. That's not why you left, right? What? I mean, you didn't leave to be a surfer. Was it Sweden or Switzerland? You can only... be a skier. Did Burcu tell you? I guess you were supposed to move to Sweden with Berke, right? Something like that. What did she tell you exactly? That you quit school, so you could go with him. -That's not what happened, though. -Anyway, maybe not. And you left your job for her. It's not the same thing. I left my job. You... You left your life, your school, everything. Your music. -I still play. -That's not what Berke said. What did Berke say? He used to come and tell Burcu some stuff. -And then she tells you? -Whatever. I was with Berke for six years. What are you even saying? So, didn't he take off after that? After what? -Man! How did we get back to this again? -What? Tell me. Whatever caused that scar on your arm, that incident. Wow, you knew all this stuff, yet you kept quiet. What Berke said, you know... Stop beating around the bush and tell me now! He couldn't tell you he wanted to break up after you got pregnant. But he did tell me he didn't want kids. We were still together after that. He couldn't tell you. Sometimes you just can't. How can he not say it for two years? Is this what that son of a bitch, that asshole, tells people? You should've just erased him too, then. Since we got on, you've been talking about all this stuff! You constantly remind me of the past. "Constantly"? -It's only been eight hours or so. -Don't remind me! Don't remind me. Leyla... I'm sorry. Okay. -Leyla, I'm sorry. -Okay! -Sir, why did we stop? -We ran over an animal. The engineers are checking for other casualties. We'll be moving soon. Other casualties? Something odd happened. I don't know exactly where we are. I seems we ran over an animal. Anyway, we turn our cameras to Ms. Leyla. Let's see what Ms. Leyla has to say about the wedding tomorrow. Ms. Leyla? Ms. Leyla, what would you like to tell us about tonight's wedding? See, everyone at the wedding is watching you. Seventy-five million behind the screens. Berke's here too. He's watching. What would you like to tell him? Ms. Leyla? You're not talking? Actually, I am not supposed to be here. Now that I think about it, I can see how bad of an idea it is. Because the person I called a friend... is marrying my ex, who told me, "I'm never going to get married, girl. I'm not that guy." I thought about getting off and going the opposite direction. I thought, the further the better. But look at me. I'm here. I even have an invitation. An invitation. You know the morning we woke up in your apartment, Berke? Just the two of us, remember? You told me, "Don't go, stay." So I did. It's been six years in that chair next to you, Berke. To trust one person with all your hopes and dreams... I know these are all ridiculous, but that's what I did. I built all my hopes and dreams around you. When you lose the only thing you have, you're left with nothing. You desperately look for something to replace it. Something... Something you can say is yours, something you can cuddle with. A piece of him. I thought you were never getting married, Berke? "An ultimately irrational institution," you said. Et cetera. But look. Ultimately, we're at your wedding. The guy who told me he would never get married is getting married. I am only going to tell you one thing. Burcu, you listen too. I think you're a horrible person, Berke. You truly are a bad person. No one else in my life hurt me as bad as you did. You're a bastard, a scumbag, a jerk, an asshole... You're not even a dirty rat because rats are actually cute mammals. At least they have emotions. You don't have that either. I try to see you in everyone I meet. We're leaving soon. I can't trust anyone anymore because of you. I can't fill the emptiness you left. But I'm going to fucking take care of this, you'll see. Everyone, to the train! -Delete that. -Don't be ridiculous. -Delete it now. -Keep it. It was great. Can you give it to me? -To the train! -Don't delete it. Ali, can you give it to me? Ali! What's the code? -Okay, give it to me-- -What's the code? -I'm really going to. -What's the code? -Tell me the code. -You're really gonna delete it? 2758. Are you really gonna erase it? Leyla, don't. All right. PART EIGHT -You're open? -Yes, sir, we are. Can you turn off the music? -Two teas. -Two teas. Good morning. Good morning. That must be cold. Can we get another tea? When you give the order, we have to drink what you want, right? With or without milk. Or tea. -Maybe I'll drink coffee. -There's no coffeepot. That's not the point, though, Ali. Damn these never-ending issues. You know how you order tea for me? -Yes. -For me? Tea? Because it's tea, you think... Like milk coffee. I only ordered tea. Okay. Let's cancel it. Cancel the tea. What would you like? It's not important at all what she wants though, right? I wouldn't know. I'll ask her when I see her. I don't think that's the case. -What are you saying? -What I'm saying is... You know, you're so sure she'll come with you... That's what I thought until you came along, yes. Yes, that's what I'm saying. There is a person involved, Ali. And she doesn't want you. Life is not only about what you want. You have a limit and... your limit is the other person. I mean, when you decide to travel with someone, you can't decide where to go on your own. I'm learning through experience. It's the same for me. It sounds a little funny. I mean, coming from you. Why? You've wasted a quarter of your life on someone else. But I'm talking, right? I guess you forgot. I'm a master. You know, I just hit the button and forget. How bizarre. And I'm trying to remember. Like, trying to remember what it was like to be 13. Like, to want something again. I wonder what it felt like to do something without checking if it's right or not? It's really nothing to brag about. I know from my own experiences. When you grow up worrying about everything, you forget how it feels. No matter what, we'd never know when our time is up, right? I am only going to tell you one thing. Burcu, you listen too. I think you're a horrible person, Berke. You truly are a bad person. No one else in my life hurt me as bad as you did. You're a bastard, a scumbag, a jerk, an asshole... It's a smart phone. When somebody else deletes it, it doesn't work. At least turn it down. Will we watch it all? I try to see you in everyone I meet. It didn't get deleted after all. We should... Don't blame me. You're the one who didn't erase it. Go ahead and delete it. You do it. Here. Delete it. Okay, I'm sorry. Take it. Really. Delete it. Always ready to fight, right? It doesn't lock. It does lock. Passengers, the train is about to arrive at Izmir, Alsancak Station. So what are you gonna do now? I think I'm going. You are? First, I'll go to my grandma's. All right. Goodbye. It's just a ring. Don't hit that button. -What? -I mean, don't hit that button of yours. It's a shame if we erase it right away. Okay. One more thing. Nay-rina-nari-nirinom. You know. Always.
