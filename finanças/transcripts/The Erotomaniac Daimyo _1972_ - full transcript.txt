TOEI COMPANY Under the reign of the 11th shogun, Ienari Tokugawa, the empire was filled with hedonism and debauchery, and in the Bunka-Bunsei period, Edo culture reached its most developed stage. This is Shogun Ienari, a man of unequalled energy. Besides his wife, he had 21 mistresses. 54 children were born to him. The main concern of his ministers... was how to distribute this large number of princes and princesses. Now they were discussing, day after day, the marriage of his 34th child, Princess Kiyohime. Tadateru Ogura, lord of Karashima feudal clan, is suitable for her in respect of both his high birth and personality. But there's a problem with him. He's still celibate, at 34. He's reported to be a full-blooded misogynist. We've already investigated all the other clans across the country. There're no other bachelor lords. That's right. We should send Princess Kiyohime to Tadateru Ogura. We've had 11 shoguns, and the reign remains stable and firm. But maintaining a peaceful reign is more difficult than waging a war.

Yes. This position looks difficult... - but I'm looking forward to it. - You shouldn't say vulgar things. Ordinary people do these nasty things. You'll only have to offer your lower body. Only my lower body? He's a country lord. If he treats you obscenely, you'd better not take him seriously. My princess, sex is necessary solely for the purpose of ensuring prosperous posterity. Fujinami, they say Karashima is on the other side of Hakone? Yes, beyond Hakone and the sea, in the farthest land of Kyushu. That end of the Earth? The concoction of blood, sweat and tears: only men can know its fresh taste. - My lord. - What? - The 2nd of next month is the anniversary of Nobunaga Oda's death. - Right. He was the true samurai, my model wartime general. What about your wedding with Kozue? Kazuma, don't restrain yourself for my sake. As long as you remain single, I'd like to serve you as a single man. You're single-minded. My lord! What's the matter, old man? It's serious. A shogunate messenger just arrived. It's been decided Kiyohime will marry into our clan. 'Decided'? Yes. It's quite an honour. We should celebrate it with all our clan. Stupid! Refuse it right away! Refuse? No way! She's a daughter of the shogun. Whether a daughter of the shogun or the shotgun, she must be dull! - Why? - She'll be still, with her legs spread. You idiot! She's a virgin. A virgin says neither "No, no!" nor "More, more!" What are you doing? She'll never do. Anyway, once our lord gives it a try, he'll become passionate about it for sure. I doubt it. He's famous for his misogyny. He's wasting his energy. Nothing is as fine as that. He has a prejudice against it. He might have a prejudice, but he'll have to make up his mind, since it's decided the princess is coming. Devoting himself to martial arts may be good, but letting his own sword get rusty is no good. We should enjoy ourselves. "Man lives only 50 years." Compared to the lower world, this is like a dream or an illusion. Who are you? - We'll wash your body. - Keep back! We were told to, by the administrators. I'll slash you. Why do you dislike women that way? Kiyohime is arriving in a short while. In March of the 7th year of the Bunsei period, Kiyohime, daughter of Shogun Ienari, arrived at Karashima Castle. From her chief attendant down to her maids, her retinue amounted to 1,300. Sode, how big is the one that is going to enter my part? Well, I don't know yet... You only know dildos so far, don't you? 'Dildos'? Something nasty and deformed like these is... going to be entering your precious part... Be steady, my princess. Is Tadateru's thing as large as this? Our enquires weren't sufficient to be precise, but judging from secret information from his attendant... probably as large as this. What? Isn't that a horse's thing?! 'The three areas of a woman's body' refer to the tip of the nose... and the mouth, the upper one; the breasts, the middle one; and the vagina, the lower one. The key point is to attack these three areas together. To attack a woman, we start from the circumference... and then advance deep into it, through the 'castle gate'. Now deeply, then shallowly. When we've repeated this 21 times, she'll feel so good... Have you yourself obtained mastery of such techniques? Yes, only lately, after many years of effort... I don't like that. I haven't been striving at martial arts just in order to flatter a woman. My lord, conquering a woman's body means conquering Kiyohime, which means conquering the shogunate. Now shallowly, then deeply... 21 times... 21 times... Come in. Come in quickly. What's up? Do it quickly. I dislike vulgar things like that. You can omit needless procedures! All right. Ouch! That hurts! Calm down a bit. How was it? - Failure! - Failure? Lamentable. Did you make sure of the target? It was so densely covered with weeds that I couldn't have a clear idea. - It's over for tonight. - My lord! - What? - Wait a minute. In the first place, spread saliva abundantly around it. Then I'll give you a signal, by beating a drum. - A drum? - Yes. When your instrument touches her part, I'll hit it. Then push yours into hers firmly! When I hit the drum for the 2nd time, pull it out. Push at the first signal, pull at the second one? Push at the 3rd one, pull at the 4th one. - Do it according to the drum. - All right. Old man, beat more quickly! Yes, sir! They successfully had sexual intercourse. Check it, please. It's true. I'll report this for sure... to the shogun, his wife and the elder administrators. Congratulations! Enough of that! I hear men are nothing but beasts. As a lord of the remote countryside, he may not have known how to treat a woman. It was like a log. I feel like something is still caught around here. My princess, congratulations on your peaceful union. I don't think the time is ripe to tell her such things. What? She says it's insipid. One can't experience the real joy of conjugal union overnight. One can attain it only after many years of effort. You speak like a scholar. Instead of boasting of yourself, educate your rustic lord. - But she's also responsible... - Shut up! It's inadmissible to thrust a log into her bad-manneredly! Without his repentance, we can't allow him to sleep with her again. How unreasonable to consider him an ill-mannered man. How conceited! What an outrage, to criticise his sexual techniques, abusing the shogunate influence! They'll certainly report this to the shogunate and it'll be disfavourable for us. The definitive solution is to make him lustful so that... he can stop her complaining with his techniques. Do you have a good idea? I've called Hakataya here for that purpose. I'm so happy to see the administrators are well. No need to pay a compliment. Give us a hand, Hakataya. I guess you're talking about the lord. You can count on me. If you leave him to me for three days and nights... You still owe me a lot. I'm sorry. When we received the shogunate princess, we needed a lot of money. You should ensure the economy recovers quickly... and reform the politics. Now the aphrodisiac from Portugal seems to have started working. Insolent! Set me free! Insolent! How do you feel, my lord? - What's become of your mustache? - I don't need it any more. Today is the third and last day. A special 'doll' is ready for the finishing touches. - Doll? - Yes. I had it sent from France. Offering French Doll Who is it? Kozue? Where are you going? My lord has been absent for three days. I'm looking for him around here. - Think also of me a bit. - I do. Really? You're always thinking of him. You're selfish... You just have to wait 10 days to become my wife. It's been a long wait... but I'll be all the more happy. Both of you look happy. My father is in high spirits, saying he's a matchmaker for the 26th time. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Umeno, our lord just returned. My dear, come here. Get on top of me. Me, on top of you? This is the 'woman on top' position, and will make you feel so good. Put your lips on my chest. Come on. That's it. Go below. Downwards. Further down. Further down. There. Grip it. Suck it. Suck it all around. Insolent! What? You can't even manage a woman's most basic duty? Try once more! I'd been making an effort to be patient. But you've insulted me worse than a dog today! I can't tolerate you any more! Damn it! She's taking advantage of Tokugawa's power. My lord! My lord, Miyo will do anything for you. Tell me what you want. Your name is Miyo? My lord. - My lord. - Miyo. My lord... I wish I was born a boy. Even a daughter of the shogunate is just a laughingstock to men. I came down here over Hakone and the sea, only to experience misery. Miyo, I have something to ask you. What may that be? People in the world also do this? Yes, they do. What? How do they do it? They do it with their instruments, like yours. What? Do you mean they have as splendid instruments as mine? Yes. They put theirs into things like mine. Really? Do women in the world... also have splendid instruments like yours? Yes. Get down! You're the woman I looked up and down. Now, after observing your affair with that stupid lord, I've got an idea for a new game. Take off your clothes. Take them off! The ideal flesh. As your missionary father once said, you're beautiful, like an angel. But Sandra, you're not an angel any more. You're no longer an angel. You've known the pleasure and the filth of flesh. You're merely a woman. No, rather a female. By the way, your father was a big liar. Your father was a liar. "Only faith in God and crucifixes can make Heaven attainable", he used to say. But... what followed after the ideas he'd preached? Torture. Hell. Torture like hell! Neither crucifixes nor Buddhist prayers can realise a heaven in this world, but money can. Money, only money can. Look. This room is a heaven. This room is a heaven. Heaven! Why do you look at me in that way? Certainly I'm converted from Christianity. Right. I'll make you completely experience this wonderful heaven an ex-Christian has made, and... the sinful nature of woman behind the nonchalant expression you affect. Mahalia. Sandra, do you want me? I'm going mad. Please... Why on Earth has the lord made a foreigner his mistress? It looks like he's gone mad. Why do you do nothing about it? - Well, he knew the taste of woman for the first time... - Shut up! You administrators have forgotten the fact... that Kiyohime is a princess of the shogunate? No, not at all! Beautiful! I've been waiting for you, Sandra. I didn't know even half the joy other people did. I'll make up for it. - My lord! - What? What do you want? I didn't call you. Is this nasty behaviour of yours intended to harass my princess? Shut up! You still call her 'princess'? She was, before marrying me... now she's just my wife. Get away! - I won't. - What? Why do you think I've come down to this end of the Earth? - 'This end of the Earth'? - Yes. A married couple at the end of the Earth is like this? My lord! Don't make a fuss! Don't be stubborn! - What if the rumour reaches Edo? - I won't care. Be reasonable! - I need Sandra! - No, you don't! Can't you see the noble and beautiful princess? - She's not a woman. - I'm not? A woman can please a man, as she can! Beast! I'll never see you again! My princess! You went too far. Apologise to her, please. You also call her 'princess'? Do you flatter the shogunate? My lord, wait, please. I hear people hold women in the licensed quarters, or keep mistresses. I'll inspect the castle environs. Shut up! We're all worried. - Go to Kiyohime's bedroom, please. - Shut up! People hold women in the licensed quarters, and even have illicit liaisons. Why shouldn't their lord be allowed the pleasures they taste? As the lord, I forbid you all to have sex between men and women. My lord! Shut up! I ban anyone from having sex in all the territory. The shogunate wouldn't hit upon this kind of decree. He made this decree partly because he felt antipathy... towards the central power of the shogunate. However, it was more because... in his mind, intense jealousy against people indulging in pleasures he didn't know... was raging. A person of material power should be likewise also in the sexual sphere. His single-minded thoughts reached... every corner of the territory as a stern decree by the end of the day. You're happy, since you marry in the same month as our lord does. I'm 34, as old as he. We're completely alike, right, Kiyo? But one thing is different. The princess was a virgin, while this Kiyo is a skilled third-timer. And she looks like a remarkable person. What are you saying? Can you really see me with your little deep-set eyes? I'll strangle you! How vulgar! Have a good time. I'll play the part of co-sleeper. Her hairdo is too much... Watch out! What is he doing? Kiyo, come closer. My lord. Hurry. I allow you to be my wife from today on. Your wife... But I can't be relaxed, because of that co-sleeper. Don't worry about a man of such humble birth. - Come under the bed cover. - My lord. - No! - I've not done anything yet. I wonder what sort of noise she'll make? Do well! Stop! A sex ban has been announced. Decree 175 was issued. Stop having sex right away. Oh, dangerous! Just in time. Stop it! A sex ban has been issued. Official, what is a 'ban'? Is it a kind of pan? A ban is a ban! It's completely forbidden to have sex. Absurd! Why do we get married? What do we live for? We marry so that we can have sex as we please, don't we? Let's do it! - I was just a few centimetres away from it! - You're lucky. You'd be executed immediately. For prevention, we apply a seal. Open your flies. - The next one. - Yes. Tomorrow morning we'll check whether it's still there. If it's been erased, you'll be punished most severely. It's sad! The next one. OK. Good. I've never had a massage like this before. - My lord. - What? Bring the special oil for him. 'Special'? I'm satisfied. I was half-blind, indulging only in the manly world. Sandra, this is paradise. Where does this massage come from? Holland or Portugal? It's from Turkey. Turkey? - My lord. - What? Today is the anniversary of Nobunaga Oda's death. - How should we proceed with the celebrations? - Idiot! Nobunaga has no importance. Go away! - You should take a little. - It's not good for your health. No, I don't want to. Fujinami, Edo may be full of blossoms by now. My princess... I dreamt a dream of Edo last night too. The cherry blossoms in Kan'eiji temple were beautiful. I don't want to make you stay in a place like this any longer. But once a woman gets married... I know. I'm no longer a princess. Fujinami, is our lord with the foreign woman tonight too? Our princess is pitiful. It's all that vixen Sandra's fault. Vixen! This vixen! You seduced him! Vixen! Hurry up! Why do you help me? You shouldn't stay here. You would only become unhappy. Morita! Forget everything, this castle and the lord. I'll accompany you to the border. - Have you found Sandra? - No. - Stupid! Search for her quickly. - Yes. There's no woman superior to her in this world. Without noticing it, I've come to this seashore... where my father was executed. Perhaps I'm no longer qualified for serving God. My heart seeks God, while my body wants pleasure. I'm moving away, bit by bit, from God. I supposed you would be here, since your Christian father was executed in this very place. You don't have any liberty. You're a handmade doll I created. A doll needs no mind. I'll make you incapable of ever getting away from me. What's wrong with you? Do you have a nosebleed? I have an atrocious headache. I feel like all my blood is surging up to my head. A strange sensation. It's only natural - we've been abstinent for two months. I can't concentrate on my work. I'm making errors in my calculations. What are the administrators doing? Do they think we can work properly under these conditions? I can't bear this any more... - What's wrong? - I'm bleeding from my nose... The punishment of law breakers is taking place in the courtyard. We'll cut off your manhood, so you won't be able to break the decree again. My beloved man! Leave for Edo right now and hand this letter to the elder administrators. Yes. We must report this, so the Karashima clan will be abolished. Our princess is pitiful. - Understand? - Yes. Hold it. We can't let you depart. Who are you? I have no known name to tell you. Give me the message. I'll keep this. The erotomania of the lord is troublesome, but you'd better not report this to Edo. Countryman! I won't forgive you. What are you doing? Filthy... Countryman. I won't forgive you. Actually you're glad, aren't you? You may do that, but no further. Stop, please. I can stop, but it's got this erect. Your nipple is pushing out. You may go there, but no farther. Stop, please. A large cobweb covers yours. You've never used it. It's gushing from your fountain. That's called 'the source of the hot spring', and is the source of a woman's life. Fertile hot water. Stop, please. Can I really stop? You may go there, but from there onwards... 'From there onwards', you want this? You may go there, but from there onwards... From there onwards... it's the finish. Deplorable! Do you still keep up your vices? Father, don't get so excited, or your blood pressure will go up. He's right. Father-in-law, I hope you live a long time. Father-in-law? How do you do? I'm Tsuya, his wife. 'His wife'? She's a daughter of which vassal? She was well known in Maruyama prostitute quarters in Nagasaki. I ransomed her, so she's like a mistress. Silly! Get away right now! Don't say that - he's back home after four years. Already four years? Brother, do you have any good ideas to cure the lord's disease? No. He expelled me because I was a woman chaser, and now he's become one himself... But, you can't call woman chasing a disease. It often happens with men. You interpret things the way you please. Umeno, you'd better study the field. I'm willing to give you lessons if you like. Nasty! But the clan got into a mess due to that 'nasty' thing. You should train the princess. But Fujinami stays by her... If she complains, tell her she enjoyed herself a lot last night. You were having an affair again! I felt something was unusual! Don't be upset. I do everything for the sake of the clan. A Naniwa stage show is resident in the castle town now. Take the princess there. A woman in bloom is a problem. Her woman-in-bloom skin... was caressed ardently, and caught fire. After all the 48 positions, it's finally time for him to treat her most roughly. She no longer knows whether it's a dream or reality. Even a noble lady is a woman. How lustful you are! Indecent. Like this? Yoshitsune, it's as if a burning rod was running wildly. How is this? Oh, I can't stand it any more. - Like this? - Just there. Attack more. Yoshitsune, I'm going mad. I'm coming. I'm coming. Umeno, what does 'coming' mean? Uh... How is she coming? Well, I hear all women say that at climax. Do you also say it? - Well, I don't yet... - I see... 'Coming' is a really funny expression. Don't be afraid. You'll be... fond of this one day. Grip this. Grip this, hurry. Kozue, come here. Comfort me. Kozue, do you refuse to do what I tell you? Forgive me. Forgiven or not, do as I tell you. I can't do that. You can never do as I tell you? Come here. Move it more. Move it faster. Right there. Deeper. Kozue, you suddenly got skillful. Are you satisfied without a real one? Once you've known it, you can no longer forget it. You're insolent. We're in the castle. - Go away. - Can I really go away? No. Don't stop! I exceptionally allow you... 'Allow'? I'm happy to be allowed... How is this? How is this? Good? I'll die. I'll die. I'll die. Umeno, she's saying she'll die. - I must save her! - My princess, don't worry. Any woman says that at climax. 'Die'? Where has she learned that? Without learning, a woman's body makes her say it in spite of herself. You'll also say it in that way some day. Damn it! He doesn't need to go that far. You, enough of this! You promised me not to use the 'five spots' method with others. I only used the 'three spots' method. I patiently do everything for the clan's sake, out of loyalty. - What are you saying? - Stop! You may be fed up with your service in the castle, once you've tasted this. I learned a lot from your "I'll die". Fujinami, I won't blame you. But I'll take care of our princess, you should agree. Look at it well. You can see something like an opened chestnut burr? Sure, it looks that way. But it's not a chestnut burr, but a nest of the bird called 'the clitoris'. 'A nest of the bird called the clitoris'? That's right. It's made like a chestnut burr. And in it, chicks wait for food. - I can't see any chicks. - Wait a moment. They need food to put their heads outside. My princess, how do you feel? The chicks are asking for food like this. I start to experience a strange sensation. Do women say "I'll die" this way? No, not yet... When the chicks can't breathe, with their mouths full of food, they let out the phrase. My lord. What's the matter? A vassal broke the ban. What? Who is that unpardonable one? Morita, you also broke the ban?! Yes. It's the way true humans should behave. We're reprimanding you with our deaths. My lord, come to yourself. Since he's served you as an attendant for many years, please allow him... to commit hara-kiri in the proper manner. I'm ready for it. We can only marry formally in this world, but in the other world we... My lord, understand my thoughts, please. All right. I'll allow your wish. I order Kozue to commit hara-kiri. You'll act as second for your beloved woman. A woman has never committed hara-kiri. Please allow me to do it. You'll survive... as my attendant. My lord... Morita, I was... I was... happy, because... I slept with you... even if only once. Morita, give me the last blow. Give me the last blow. Quickly. No to the ban! Close the gates quickly! Let us have sex! - No to the ban! - Repeal the ban! Repeal decree 175! Let us have sex! We disagree with the ban! - What are the red flags? - Women's underwear. 'Underwear'? Dangerous... very dangerous. Calm down! We're only doing our duty. - We also want to have sex. - Eh? I misspoke. Calm down! The people are unusually upset. We have no choice but to persuade him to revoke the ban. That will be useless. He has never agreed with the advice of the administrators. I've never before heard of a sex ban being issued. It'd be better to be tolerant of sex, in order to soothe the people. As we've deviated from that path, we need to take measures to mitigate it. I've also been thinking about what measures to take. Firstly, I propose bringing a large number of charming boys from Edo. Secondly, providing the people with animals called 'pigs' as toys. 'Pics'? According to Hakataya, the sex of this animal is quite similar to that of a woman. We couldn't put down the rioters with such a measure. How about giving them one day of freedom as an emergency measure? But they'll get incapable of restraining themselves again. Perhaps I'm also responsible for the confusion in the castle town. Umeno, I heard Sandra had gone back to Hakata. Let me see her. I want to know how that foreigner won the heart of my lord. I want to know why he's so attached to you? Sandra, what is most important in sex? Tell me. It's the heart. The heart? With the heart that loves, we can do anything. Anything? Love between a man and a woman is... the most beautiful thing in this world. The most beautiful thing in this world... Sandra, I thank you. I was silly. Princess... How pitiful... I'm alone... No, you aren't. I'm with you... I'll cry the day you say goodbye to me. All right, I agree never to shed tears down my cheeks. "Goodbye. "I love you. "The end of transient love. "Swaying kisses in swaying summer. "You are everything to me. "Goodbye. "I love you. "Tears come into my eyes, "since I'm a woman. "I don't want to say sad words. "The commencement of the parting that comes some day. "I love you." Look at it. Look well, with your eyes wide open. - Look! - Stop! You can soil me, but never my God. Stop projecting His image! Do you want me to stop? You can bear being soiled yourself, but not your God being profaned? That is a naive belief. Sandra, who is your master? Who is your master? That's right. You're right... I'm your master. Not Zeus, but me. Step on it. Step on it. I can't. No, I can't. No? You haven't yet become my slave entirely? I'll make you step on it. Catch Sandra! You can kill her! Sandra! Let go of me! Let me die. Listen to me. Give me your life. My life? I can't expect to live long, either. We should reprimand the lord with our deaths. Sandra. Do you hold me... for the lord? My life is yours. Hold me... for yourself. For me, too. Sandra... I know what true love is, for the first time. I love you. I held you for myself. For myself. I love you. I love you. I love you. Insolent! Bastard! You had an affair with my mistress. Never forget this behaviour of mine! No one has the right to issue a sex ban, - even if it's the shogunate... - Shut up! Save Sandra, please. Farewell. My lord, don't execute Sandra. What? Execute Sandra? Nakamura, who ordered her execution? Those who break the ban all get punished. The law is already working, independent of you. It's applied even to the person you favour most. My lord, decree 175 is effective. The sex ban was lifted. Decree 175 was cancelled. Decree 175 was cancelled. The sex ban was lifted. Kiyo, let's celebrate! We're free to have sex! I'm not a princess from Tokugawa, but the wife of Tadateru Ogura. I'm a woman, whose warm blood is circulating inside. You spoke well. You and I are a pistil and a stamen, and everything develops from them. My dear. Great. You're also nice. Give more food to the chicks in the nest of the clitoris bird! The chicks... the chicks are leaving the nest. This is an Eden. My dear... you've responded well to my wish. I'm dying. I'm... - I'll die too. - dying. I'll die. Release me! - Release me! - No, I won't. - I'll die. - I die... In December of the 7th year of the Bunsei period, Tadateru Ogura died... a sudden death during sexual intercourse. The next year, 2,467 babies were born in the castle town, 8 times more than the average annual number, says an old book. All is right with the world. No one is allowed to govern or control sex: the source of all life, even if in the name of God. The End Translated by Quaisnord for ADC Revised by Lord Retsudo for ADC
