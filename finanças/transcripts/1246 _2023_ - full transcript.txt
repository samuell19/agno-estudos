(waves breaking) (wind blowing) (calm music) It's a way of life. A way of thinking. When you born into it, (police radio chatter) it's in your DNA. (distant police siren) (police radio chatter) You can't just walk away, (police radio chatter) regardless of how hard you try. (calm music) And the undercurrent is so strong that you consciously make bad decisions, fully aware of the consequences. (kitten meows) But occasionally you cross paths with someone special, someone who was born under the same circumstances as you. But it's clear they belong in another dimension, somewhere amongst the stars, but trapped in a human body. (police siren) When you meet such a person, don't be jealous or envious. (police siren) Just do all within your power to help them realize their full potential. (clock ticking) So you think smoking weed is wrong? I don't know. I mean it's illegal, right? Oh so, if it's illegal, then it's wrong? Hm. I don't know what I'm saying right now. What's your point? Think about it. How could something that make you feel so good be wrong? (Ray chuckles) (Ray sighs) You know Doc? I don't even know what you're talking about. You're low key blowing my high. Oh, so you smoke weed to get high? That's the point, isn't it? Now see, that's your problem. You smoke weed to escape your problems. When I come down off my high, I'm still high. 'Cause I'm high on life. Man, that is bull shit. 'Cause every time I come over here your high. So what are you talking about? So you think because I'm blind that I don't see shit? All right, fine. Tell me what finger I'm holding up then. I might can't see what finger you holding up, but I can see you approaching a crossroad. A crossroad? Yeah, a crossroad.

If not, those dead bodies are gonna start piling up. On Dre? Let me think. (telephone rings) I think I can get to Deuce's wife. Really? Yeah, she wants him to go straight. Dino told me in our last conversation. Alright, go for it. I got you Cap. (gentle calm music) [Television Commentator] The home side has something going now and the crowd is loving it. It's the bottom of the eighth inning and so far it's been a very tight game. Hey baby. Hey, what's going on? You okay? We need to talk. About what? (Stephanie sighs) I knew what I was getting into. Married a cop. I even prepared myself for the worst. But now that we have a child on the way, I don't know what I would do if you didn't come home. Like it is freaking me out. Has that crossed your mind? (gentle calm music) (Stephanie sniffs) (train rattles) Listen Ray, I just wanna know the truth. The truth about what? How involved are you with Dre? It's not fair. If I give you my heart, then I deserve to know the truth and what I'm getting myself into. Okay. All right. I drive for him and don't even gimme that man. He pays for my studio time and household music and that's my music videos. Okay, we're also friends. That's it. (train rattles nearby) Just please, just promise me you'll stop driving for him after the project is done. I promise. (gentle music swells) (birds sing) What's up? So they want a war, huh? How you think we should handle this? Look, I got a couple investment properties, family. Getting tired of this shit. Sh, people dying from nothing. Nothing? You call 30 thousand a day nothing? How the fuck you think you got them two investment properties? Look, handle your business or I will. [Lisa] You promised me that you were cutting that shit lose. [Deuce] I am, I just need a little bit of time that's all. [Lisa] You're getting too old for this shit. I'm not trying to raise our kids alone. [Deuce] Lisa! (throbbing bass sounds) (door closes) (kitchen door slams) What is it? So what is it gonna be Deuce? What are we talking about? I drove by the store today. It didn't look like anyone was trying to break in. Look Deuce, we've been together since high school. I've given you two kids, you've never lied to me. So please don't start now. I can't tell you what's going on right now Lisa. I just need you to trust me. You promised me that you were cutting that shit loose. I am. I just need a little bit of time that's all. We're getting too old for this shit. I'm not trying to raise our kids alone. Lisa! Just, just gimme a little bit of time alright. (ominous bass sound throbs and builds) (car door closes) Can I help you? Yes. I'm Detective Johnson. That's my partner Detective Beasley. Okay. Look, I'm not trying to harass you, but I do have some information for you. I don't have time for this. We have nothing to talk about. Please just listen. Your husband, he's caught in the middle of a street war. I know he doesn't wanna be involved, but he is. And they're forcing his hand. Here, take our card. Maybe you can give us some information to help us, help Deuce. Take a look around, the world's a ugly place. There's no time for widows. (car door closes) Nice move. (car engine starts) (high pitched sound hums) (high pitched beat) (high pitched beat) (door clicks shut) Yo. From this day forward, every breath he take is numbered. Ah fuck that nigga man. Puss ass nigga. We gonna shut this shit down. After that everybody will know who the real king pin is. (high pitched beat) (birds singing) (spray bottles spritzes) (heavy footsteps) Ray baby. Can you come here for a minute? It's like every time I try to leave this house, Just bring your ass here. (Ray sighs heavily) Yes. I'm so proud of you. For what? Cause your ass met your curfew. (Ray laughs) I am just excited every day. (Ray sighs) I guess. I don't mean to be so rough, but I just don't want nothing to happen to you like your brother. Hm, I mean, I get it. Come here. I love you so much son. That's so sweet. (Bottles rattle in fridge door) And where is your ass going? To the mall? With who? My crew. Mom. Mm. You see that shit? Your black ass better be in here by dark. I know, I know. Bye. Ah. Oh, she think her ass cute. I think she been around boys. I need you to follow her. Oh, that meant me. Yes. Go now and follow her ass. My life don't revolve around her. Today it does. (Gentle sounds hum loudly) (Music builds and throbs) (music becomes somber) (ringing electrical sound fizzes) Hey yo. I found out where they be hanging out at. The trap house. [Man] Word? Let's get them niggas tonight, man. What y'all wanna do? [Man] Hell yeah. Say less then. Let's ride. Hey, you got a sec? What up? I gotta know, how long am I gonna be driving? What you worried about your future with me man? Yeah, I guess. I understand though, man. But you know me. I believe in you. Why don't you think I believe in you man? You know what I mean? Because you the only one I know who can get out this business man. You know what I mean? Get out what you doing man? Why you think I got you driving? You know what I mean? Letting you know there's nothing free in this world, man. You know what I'm saying? You feel me? You right. You know your key man. You know what I mean? I got your back don't worry about it man, let's go. (police radio chatter) (ethereal type music) (police radio chatter) (police radio chatter) [Radio dispatcher] Unit two 61. You have a domestic disturbance in progress. 1 o 637 Birmingham Avenue. Apartment 102. (police radio chatter) (ethereal music) [Radio Dispatcher] Unit two 61 Hold on, hold on, hold on. [Radio dispatcher] Stand by for an address change. Standing by. [Radio dispatcher] The correct address is 1 o 636 Birmingham Street, Apartment 102. Copy that. A newbie huh. Yeah. (gentle music sounds) [Police Captain] Seven Dead. The crazy part is, we were right there in front of the building on a domestic violence call, but dispatch rerouted us because of a wrong address. Look, is there anything we can do to stop this war? I have an idea. We can take Deuce down now. We'll probably lose K P, but it'll stop a lot of the violence. I don't think we have a choice guys. When can you take Deuce down? I think we should lean on Deuce's wife. We tell her the truth, that Deuce is in danger, that she get us some leverage and she can tell us everything that she knows. Maybe we can also get a inside track on the next showdown. What do you think Roland? (intense rhythm throbs) I think it's worth a try. Okay, if that doesn't work, let's take Deuce off the streets. Copy that. Yes sir. (distant rap music beat) (birds singing) Lisa. That war we warned you about, it's already started. One of Deuce's distro spots has been hit and seven people were killed. They're coming after Deuce. It's only a matter of time. Deuce doesn't tell me anything about his business. That was a part of the deal. We understand that. But in order for us to help Deuce, we're gonna need somebody to break that deal. What are you saying? You want me to snitch on my husband. Snitch? We already know what your husband does. So why haven't you arrested him then? Because it's not him that we want. It's his boss K P. And we just here so that you and your children do not become casualties of war. Look, we're gonna need you to dig a little bit deeper and see what you can find out. You still have our card? (angelic voices hum) (clock ticks) (gentle calm singing) How many girlfriends you got? I mean I, I would just say I have like this one shorty I'm messing with, you feel me? Y'all fuckin'? I mean, hell yeah. You use protection? What you my father now? Of course I use protection. Why? I tell you why. Because that's probably what your parents taught you, right? And it's probably what society taught them. I mean, what's wrong with that? I mean, it is for your own good, right? Rubber to skin. That shit ain't natural. Now skin to skin, that's where it's meant to be. The problem is y'all wanna fuck everything in a skirt and two legs. That shits for the birds. And what do birds do? They spread shit. Find yourself a girl, man. A eagle, someone special. Someone that you can trust, and she can trust you. And y'all keep that shit on lock. Tight. That's what it's meant to be. Fuck all that condom shit. (clock ticks) (car breaks squeal) (angelic gospel singing) My boy, my boy. What's happening baby? You alright? Wide open. (angelic gospel singing) What's up? What's up man? How you doing today man? Alright. Yeah, same old, same, same. That's what's up man? Stay hydrated out here man it's hot out here. I'm telling you boy. It might be hot in more than ever ways though. Them people been staring at you for a minute, man. Stay on your toe. (angelic gospel singing) What's up? Y'all need something?

Don't act like you didn't hear. Bless you live. You understand me. You man I'ma let you live But next time I catch you I'ma spank you. You understand me? All right, all right. (men muttering) (knocking on door) Who? Hold on. Who is it? [Ray] It's me nigga. Can you come back later though? Come on y'all I gotta ask you a question. All right. Hold on. [Ray] Hang up on that little boy. Come in. Damn. What's up? So the crew? Huh? What are you talking about? Come on, yo. I was at the mall too. So that's how it is, huh? Listen, it's not even like that for real. I just wanna know why you lying to mom? Because you know how she would react. (Ray laughs) Okay? I get it. But don't lie to me. All right? All right. Now call that musty boy back. (gentle rolling notes) Thank you. You're welcome. Are you okay? Yeah. (gentle rolling music) Love you. I love you too. (Kids laughing) Come here. What's up with you guys? Oh. Ticka, ticka, ticka, ticka, ticka. (all giggling) All right kids. Time to take a nap. All right, go and listen to momma. (girl giggling) Babe can you bring me something to drink? Okay. (intense sound throbs) Thank you. (Intense throbbing builds) (silence) (intense throbbing sound) (phone ringing) [Man On Phone] Yo. How'd it go? [Man On Phone] It didn't. What happened? [Man On Phone] Cops were staked out in front. They arrested a couple of the guys that came out the house. Fuck. [Man On Phone] What's going on man? Literally just woke up man. I feel like I was drugged or something. [Man On Phone] I'll holler back. I'm out. Cool. Why didn't you wake me up? I tried. If I didn't know any better, I think you drug me or something. Yeah. And if I didn't know any better, I would think you promise to move is some bullshit. Where'd that come from? If you can make a bullshit comment so can I. You want some coffee? Fuck you. Great work out there. Thank you Cap. Excellent John. Thanks Cap. Sit down. So what you got? So we got the spot that Dre's crew hangs out at and we have a new informant, Deuce's wife. Good call. What's your next move? So we're gonna go stake out the spot, get some ears in there. Sounds good. (gentle piano plays) Just please, just promise me you'll stop driving for him after the project is done. I promise. (gentle piano plays) I don't mean to be so rough, but I just don't want nothing to happen to you like your brother. I mean, I get it. Come here. I love you so much son. (gentle piano plays) I might can't see what finger you holding up but I can see you approaching a crossroads. A crossroads? Yeah, a crossroads. (gentle piano music) Look how much longer will you be working with Dre? Why? Everybody knows what happened. Were you there? No. Is it really worth it? Why don't you just go get a job and pay for the rest of the production yourself? Dre is making enemies and so will you if you keep hanging around him. (piano music becomes more intense) Look, I'm afraid and I just don't wanna lose you. Then don't be afraid then, nothing's gonna happen. (gentle piano music) What's up babe? Hey, what's going on? Look, fuck the streets. Fuck the game. Fuck all that shit. You and my babies, that's all I got. Look, pack everything up. Sell our properties. Know some people in South Carolina could open up a barbershop or something. Whatever. I just wanna start a new life with you.

So I just left Deuce's grave site, and his kids were there. Two of the cutest kids I ever seen in my life. And all I could think about was you and our baby. I can't do this no more. After we take K P down, I'm gonna change careers. So I believe Skinny and D Rock took out one of Dre's gang members, Lucky. He wasn't lucky that night though. And I believe it was Dre who actually executed Deuce in a pretty much opposite. I suspect the hit on Lucky was not approved by K P. Cause Skinny and D-Roc, they both disappeared. I don't think they'll be popping up anytime soon because from what I heard, K P and Deuce were real close. Who's the question mark? I don't really know. I think it's the kid I saw in the car that night. And if so, he's just a driver. So where do we go from here? Well, Dre wants the world. He's not gonna stop until K P is dead. And if so, things gonna get a lot worse before they get better. And your informant? I'm not sure. Now that her husband dead she may ghost us. Or she may want revenge. On who? Dre? Not just Dre. Everybody. The gang killed her husband. So you think she'd be willing to go deeper? I think it's worth a try. Let me talk to her. All right, let's go for it. (calming gentle notes) I keep wondering, if I had listened to you the first time you approached me, would things have turned out differently. He was walking away you know, we were planning to sell our properties and move to South Carolina and start over. He wanted to open a barbershop. Yeah. I wanna help you take down K P. You sure. She trusts me. Her and Deuce were like family. I don't know ah. K P is ruthless and, I will wear a wire. You can bug my phone, anything. Isn't it you who told me that now isn't a time for widows? Well, maybe I can help another wife before it's too late. You still have Deuce's cell? Yes. Let me have it. We'll bug it. And when you invite K P over you can offer it to her and maybe we can get some helpful information from there. Anything you want. Thank you. Can I ask you a question? Sure. How were you planning to help Deuce? Well we were gonna arrest him and take him off the streets until all this died down. [Debra] What are y'all simple asses arguing about now? [Keisha] Nothing. [Debra] Simple ass kids. (footsteps on stairs) [Keisha] I wasn't [David] So who's Rebecca? [Keisha] She's just my friend. [David] A friend that you've been hugging and kissing? [Keisha] I have not. We're not even official. [David] Not official. Yo, we've been official for three months. [Keisha] We have not. Hey man, what the fuck is going on in here man? Ray. And who the fuck are you? Ray what are you doing? Hey man, you gotta get outta here man. I'm sorry. Get out. I'm, I'm talking. Nigga did you not hear me? Get out the house. Right. Damn. And back to you. Who told you to have some nigga in the house? Okay, so what, I got a boyfriend. At least I'm not out here on the streets killing people. My God, what are you even talking about? We all know that Dre has been paying for your studio time. That's why you drive him. Right? Right? And we all know what Dre does. No. What me and Dre do is none of your goddamn business. Really. Really? Cause if mom knew that, she would not say that. If mom knew about that little dirty ass nigga. If mom fucking knew what? What are y'all simple asses arguing about now? Nothing. Simple ass kids. (birds squawking) (car breaks squeak) Look I have something to tell you. What? Turn around. What? You're pregnant or something? Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. You for real? How d'you feel? That's what's up. I'm gonna have a family. We're gonna have a family. (clock ticks) You know I finished my album. Congratulations. Thank you The girl I was telling you about, she's pregnant. You love her? Yeah. I do. Good. A young family. The odds are stacked against you, but if you love each other you'll be okay. What's that I smell? I don't know. What you smell my cologne? What are you afraid of? I'm not even going to bore you about how I lost my eyesight. But like you, I was at a major crossroad and I took the wrong road. But if you lucky enough to come out alive, you could always get back on the right road. But here's the catch, it won't be clean. You'll carry those scars for the rest of your life. Got you. (clock ticks) (baby laughs) You can't catch me. No you can't. Be quiet and sit down. You okay? Yeah we good. Thank you. Yeah, there's more where that came from. What's going on? I went to Deuce phone. I came up on some information that, well, let's just say, this information will be more beneficial to you than for me. I appreciate that. That was it. Lisa. I'm gonna find out who pulled that trigger. Thank you. (crickets chirping) (gentle music plays on TV) Ray. Yeah. Where you going? Going to the studio for a late session. Hm, be back before midnight. Yeah, I got you. Hey Ray. I'm really sorry about Lucky. It's all good. (gentle calm music) What's wrong? You're lying. Listen, I just miss Lucky that's it. Well, are you almost finished with Dre? Yeah. I got like one session left. I'm scared. Why? Ain't nothing to be scared of. Every time something good happens to me, something bad always has to ruin it. Listen, nothing's gonna happen okay. I promise. (gentle calm music) (birds squawking) We gotta go. It's going down. (car engine starts) (police siren wails) (Train bell rings) (train horn blares) (train horn gets louder) (two gun shots) Fuck! (gun shot) (two gun shots) (two gun shots) (gun shot) (gun shot) (three gun shots) (gun shot) (three gun shots) (train rattles past) (police sirens wail) (police shouting) (gun shots) (sirens wail) Now I know what you're thinking. Why couldn't he just walk away? (voices chatter) (gentle calm music plays) Well, how do you know he didn't? Now that's what will happen if you take the wrong road. (gentle music plays) (clock ticks) (gentle music plays) (train bell rings) (train horn sounds) (train horn gets louder) (two gun shots) Fuck.
