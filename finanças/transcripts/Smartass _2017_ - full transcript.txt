What? What were you gonna say? Uh, just that, I'm glad that you're traveling with. Well, it was either you or Air Force One, so. Hey. What's up? Come here for a minute. Ooh, you're like a fuckin' terrorist. You're comin' with me. That's exactly what a terrorist would say. We're going to Burger Bomb. Oh, why didn't you just say that in the first place? Bye, Nick. You have work to do. Hey, Donny. Hey, Otto. She dead? - Her, no. - She looks dead, dude. You can't say that 'cause she's not dead. - Oh, she's not dead? - No. - Where'd you get her? - She was a gift. - Oh, she was a gift, huh? - Yeah. Think when she dies, they're gonna, I don't know, give you a new one? Yeah, see, I don't know why she said that 'cause she's not gonna die. They got shit goin' on by the stairs. Yeah? Otto, what's going on back there? Yeah, Donny, she's like grabbing onto her fuckin' head, dude. Let her go. Let her go. Walk, dude. Let her go. Take her up, man, get her inside. What the fuck? Sorry. It's cool, brother. See you around. Let's go. Yeah. Still think she's gonna die. She probably will. Hey. Yo. Nick, meet Chuchu. Chuchu, you say hello to Nick. Nice, real sweetheart. Now, Nick, you gotta promise me. You gotta be careful with this stuff because it's gonna make your face drip off in like five minutes. Not that that's a bad thing, by the way. That clean, huh? Yeah, the guy's a fuckin' psycho, dude. You know? You know, he made me take her if I wanted to buy his shit. Nick, the dude fuckin' gave me a human being. Obviously I did because the dude's fuckin' scary, ya know? So, Donny, I have a favor. I didn't come up with all the money. Uh, shit. That kinda makes me a little nervous because the dude was sketchin' out about nothing bad happening, now you're telling me you only got half his money, Nick. Say yes, Donny. You know I'm good for it. If you're not cut out for this shit, go get a job at a carwash. Will you just take a minute and just listen to the words that are comin' outta your mouth, please? Look, my guy is a trust fund surfer. It'll be fine, just meet me at the beach around 10 and I'll have the rest of it. Yeah, right, meet at the beach at 10 because nothing bad ever happens at the beach, right? Donny! You know, we're up. I'm fine, right? I'm fine, fuck, I'll do it, but only fuckin' because it's you. Come on, buddy, you gotta eat something. Can't just survive off of donuts and drugs. I drink. Z, Yoohoo is barely considered a drink. You're crazy. Yoohoo is wizard milk. It's wizard milk. I'm getting you a burger and you're gonna eat it, okay? Hey! You're gonna eat it 'cause I love you. I don't want you to hook up with Nick. Ugh, what do you care? It's just a bad idea. I care. I mean, he's cute and I'm pretty sure he likes me. Guys like him never like me. They always like the douchey California counter girls of the world. Not true. Nope, it's definitely true. What the fuck, Z? Excuse me, do you have a warrant? Zandar Phillips gave us permission to search the vehicle, miss. Zandar, where the hell are you from? - He's from Connecticut. - I know. Mommy and Daddy Phillips are gonna be pissed. Whose is this? It's mine, actually. And why do you have it? It was a prize. - Prize? - Mm-hmm. How old are you? 18. - No, you're not. - Yeah, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. I'm arresting you. Oh, couldn't resist, could ya? Freddie. I'll meet you at the beach tomorrow, Otto. And Zandar of Connecticut, when I get back, ice cream sundaes for days. Otto, what are we gonna do? Don't worry, we're gonna be best friends in like two minutes. Shut up and get in. See? He likes me already. What are we gonna tell Nick? You don't tell him anything. I'll figure out what to say. Wait a minute, really? Really? Bitch just pops a bunch of fuckin' pills. I gotta deal with the bullshit. - Where the fuck do you live? - Where the fuck do you live? Where the fuck do I live? Yes, really. Well, you know what? Fuck this. If I can't be asking fuckin' questions, I see what's going on here. This is a collect call from-- Freddie. I accept. Freddie? Hey, Mom. You're three days late. Sorry, I thought weekly was more of a range. Where are you? California. Where exactly? Um... I don't know. How's Hugo? Sleeping. It's late. Shit, I'm sorry. I forgot the time difference. You know, Courtney had her sweet 16 last weekend. Her mother called to see if you wanted to come. I told her you were with your father. Come on, you're lying. Courtney's mom would never call. She hates me. What the fuck is a sweet 16? Is that like a fancy name for a birthday party? It's an important milestone. Why? Is 15 like a year we celebrate the surviving of? - Freddie. - Mother. Could you just please wake up Hugo, please? No. You want your family, you come home. Gosh, for the millionth time, I told you, I'm not coming home. Why are you doing this to me? Jesus Christ, Freddie, I'm really worried about you. I miss you. Stop worrying, okay? I'm fine. Will you just tell Hugo that I miss him? I gotta go. Bye. Freddie. Freddie? Stop. Okay, stop. Crying, okay. Ooh. Okay. Okay. Okay. You're lying. There's no way that she's with Dave. That guy is a total scumbag. She didn't go because of him, man. Dave's ridin' with Dready Jeff. You know what kinda player that cat is. I still think you're full of shit. She said she'd meet us at the beach tomorrow, relax. What'd he do? He, um... Sorry, man. Whatever. Get Freddie's bag. Let's go, debutante. Ooh, where we going, a ball? I got your ball. This amuses you? No, but if you're gonna make the effort. This is a mugshot. I know. But my mom always says- Nobody in here gives a damn what your white ass mama says. Lost your doggone mind. Turn. Oh, yeah, who let the wetbacks out? Hey! Step it back, would you? Oh, come on. Why am I alone? 'Cause I know it will annoy you more. Come on. What if you forget to feed me? It happens at the zoo all the time. Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. Besides, you could afford to lose a few pounds. Damn. Hey, listen, I just, I was wondering, are you guys taking bets on who's gonna win over there? Because I want in. My money's on the chicas. Why is that, cracker baby? I don't know, they work harder, not always late. You know what happens if I put you in that cell? Hmm, we toast marshmallows and sing a multiracial version of Kumbaya? Child, you got your little privileged ass arrested in the wrong county at the wrong time. Right, there is a good place to get arrested. I forgot. You don't even know, do you? Why don't you tell me? Ooh, it'll be like story time. Hmm, I'm gonna do better than tell you. Oh, come on, don't leave now. Keep playin'. Hey. What are you doing? Just trying to realign all the blood in my body so it floods to my brain so I'm not so bored. You? Releasing you, you're OR'd. What does that mean? Releasing you on your own recognizance, but you have to come back for your court date, of course. Of course, yeah. Why you smiling like that? Happy for you is all. Now get the hell outta here before I change my mind. Yes, ma'am. You gotta take her back, man. No, I will not take a gift back. - Bad luck. - Look, I'll leave her here. It'll be like I never had her, right? How bout this, I can help wake her up and then you can discuss it with her. Okay? Venice, bring something for Chuchu. It's all here? Where the fuck did she even come from anyway? She was my brother's girl, but you don't have to worry about that. The fucker is in the pen for shooting some nigger's head off. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, you fuckin' psycho voodoo bastard. You're tryin' to fuckin' kill me! It's like you fuckin' sit there in your chair with your fuckin' cowboy hat on. You look me in the eyes and you say, "I like you, Donny," 'cause I remember it, and then you send me with a lifeless chick and she's a fuckin' fruit basket. Donny. - Shut the fuck up. - You shut up. Why don't you both shut the fuck up? Relax, my brother's the least of your worries. He's as good as dead. Least of my concerns? Would you listen to yourself? You're talkin' about your own fuckin' brother here. No, no, no, no, absolutely not. No fuckin' way. My brother was a no good thug. We reap what we sow. The fuck does that mean? Now like I deserve this? What did I do? Donny, come here. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, don't start this shit again. Maybe this is a good thing. When's the last time you got laid? Are you fuckin' serious? Yes. Paolo, you gotta help me, alright? Oh, I did, she can walk now. Come on, Venice, please? Oh, fuck. Why the fuck is this happening to me? Oh. Have fun, eh? Be gentle. Hey. Where's the white girl? I let her out. Neesy, she's 15 fuckin' years old. What did you think you were gonna do with her? Send her home? It's 11:00 at night. That kid needed a lesson. Maybe but she don't deserve to die. That's not my problem. You were at lunch. Hey, girl. What you doin' out past your bedtime? Me? Yeah, you, baby. I lost my puppy. I'll be your puppy, baby. You guys got a cigarette? We got somethin' better. Girl, we got the gold. Crack is so pretty, don't ya think? You know you want it, baby. No, I want a cigarette. What if I let you have this one free? Then I'd say nothing in life is free. But I don't know, maybe we can make a deal. How much change you both got in your pockets? Come on, playas, play with me. Okay, if I smoke your freebie, you give me all your change. - What do we get? - Think about it. Why's the first one always free? It's the hook. Yep, so, if I smoke one hit and I don't want another one, you pay me. Otherwise, I'm hooked. Alright, sugarplum. So, where you from, Ma? I'm a child star. My parents went crazy and blew all my money. No way. Who are you? Bro, I'm just playing. I'm not a child star. Ready? Like it, baby? What the fuck did we tell you about peddling your shit on this side of town, huh? Hey yo, let go of my brother, beaner! Fuck you call me? Shit, he just called you a beaner! - Shut up, crack whore. - Excuse me, sir. I am not a crack whore. Yeah, I just smoked a hit of crack, but that doesn't-- Bitch, shut the fuck up. Okay. That's fucking smart. Yeah, I'm leaving. Oh, fuck, oh, shit. What we got going on over here, huh? Oh, shit!

Get the fuck outta here. Back to this motherfuckin' burrito eatin' motherfucker right here. Oh, so you nervous, huh? Oh, my God. What was that? Takin' our territory back from the Mexo. Is that wise? Hell yeah, it's our spot now. Wouldn't it just be more reasonable to, ya know, pick a spot they don't want? Oh, yeah he, oh, that's the bitch right there. No, no, no, that's the bigger bitch right here. Put it right here. Right here. My boy over there, Antoine, it was one of his boys that got shot. Now we fixin' to kill all them roaches.

But it'll be over soon. I heard that nigga just got moved back to general pop. Nah, I heard he's buying himself protection. I'm done. Deal's a deal, man. Nah, nah, no way. Nobody likes a punk. Jesus.

You should just fuckin' chill, man. That's alright, I'm a little amped anyways. That shit gets into your system no matter how careful you are. Ooh, can I get some of that shit in my system? - Yes, you may, baby. - Ooh. Hey, hey. Don't eat it all, okay? Okay, alright. Pack of cigarettes, please. $1.65. How's 1.55 sound? Like you're short 10 cents. But it's only 10 cents. - Don't care. - Come on, man. Want me to recite state capitals? I want you to have 10 more cents. Okay look, kind gas attendant man. I have had a very long day. I was locked up for four hours in a racial wrestling ring and I was just forced to smoke crack in order to obtain this perfect amount of change that you are calling 10 cents short. 'Cause it is. Oh, my God. This is what we're gonna do, okay? I'm go-- Thanks, man. - Have a great day. - Mm-hmm. Hey, you guys have a light? No smoking. Come on, please. No, child, no smoking.

I killed him. He was interfering with my money makin'. That seems kinda counterintuitive for a pimp. Yeah, he was hatin' on our cholo niggas, so he had to go. Now let me give you a tip, little girl. Ain't nobody out here this late except for murderers, hustlers, hookers, and you. So watch your back. That's a pretty weak tip. Yeah, well, here's one. Start learning how to suck dick. You'll be fine. Just stay away from them gangs. 'Cause spics be killin' niggas. Niggas be killin' spics. And as long as you ain't one of them, you be alright. What about you guys? Ain't nobody kills good pussy, honey. Yeah, baby. Nobody kills good pussy, baby. Here, take it. There, did my good deed for the day. Bye, ladies. Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Niggers! Fucking cunt.

You fuckin' bitch, I'm gonna fuckin' shoot you. Fuck, shit. Alright, I'm gonna take off. If you wanna go, you gotta take Chuchu with you. No, no, no, no. I really don't think I can. You don't wanna take her, no problem. I'll kill her. Alright, alright, I'll take her, alright? You know, when I'm done with all this shit, I'm gonna get a job at a fuckin' carwash. Nine to five, that's what I'm gonna do. No, you take Chuchu, you get the rest of the money, you don't get robbed, you don't get kidnapped, you don't get killed and this'll all be over soon. Alright, and I definitely have to take her? Yes! Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. You gonna ask me if I want ice cream? Why are you giving me money? I like to take care of the kids on the street. You have a nice one, mister. - Hey, guys. - Hey! So you didn't get shot, that's really great for, ya know, you. But I assume not for the other guys, you know? Oh, let me see, let me see. Oh, it's okay. That's 100% white girl right there. Yeah. On point. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Helen Keller. Helen Keller, right? Yes, perfect, you are perfect. No, I'm pretty sure I can see, hear and talk.

Then I'm gonna come back around and I'm gonna fuck you until you go mute. You see? Okay. That's seriously mortifying. Super clever though, that's real clever. See we got a little mouthy little smartass, little-- oh, shit! Yeah, I like her mouth. I like her mouth. No, guys, that was a compliment. Total compliment. Isn't there a war you should be tending to? Bitch, don't be talkin' to me about what I should be doin'! I should be fuckin' you right now. Truce, man? You want my cigarettes? No, I don't want no fuckin' cigarettes. Oh, ain't nobody to save your ass. Man, who the fuck? Dad, oh, my God, it's my Dad! Dad, oh, hey. Shit, one second. You know, guys, this has been real great. Ya know, he's a cop, I was just rebelling. You've seen it a million times. Hey, you know what though? You guys have a really sick ride. Next time we hang out, I wanna ride in it, you know? I got something for you to ride on! Bye guys! Helen! Helen! Ooh. So, where you going? San Diego. That ain't her daddy, nigga, that's a trick. She 'bout to suck his dick right now. Come on, man. That was my white girl, man. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just don't think you're gonna get anything from me, okay? I don't. Well, excuse me if I find that unlikely. I mean, I don't fault you for it, it's just, you're not gonna get it from me, deal? I hate clowns. What? They don't scare me, I just don't like them. I set one on fire at my friend's birthday party once. Why would you do that? Are you a serial killer? No, I'm a father. And John Wayne Gacy was a fucking clown. That doesn't mean he didn't kill little boys. I'm not a killer. Just listen, if you are a murderer, that's your business entirely. Just please don't murder me, okay? I'm way too fuckin' tired to die right now. I promise. Uh... This is far as I can take you. Thanks for not killing me. Um, uh... Z? Dude. I can see you. I'm a Cherokee! Fuck! Go around! Chill the fuck out, Z. Dude, I need you to cool off. Z, Z, it's Nick, okay? Please, please shut the fuck up. You can't have me, man. You can't have me. I'm like free. I'm like a free man. We don't want you. We need you to shut the fuck up. Hey, that's pretty good. Hey, Herman, look at this. What? Cute. That means he likes it. Right. And who are you? The ghost of Christmas past? Herman. I'm just a drunk. He's not just a drunk. Tell her. I write a little, that's all. Really? I'm Freddie, nice to meet you. I'm a runaway and according to two gang members, a smartass. Runaway, huh? Someone beat you? No. Touch you? Nope. Orphan? No, sir. One who runs away often does so to get away from something. Yes, often. But not always. Do you know what impetuous means? No. It means a person who acts in a rash and inconsiderate manner, often the mark of the very young. I think you just insulted me with a thesaurus. Well, as much as I love to be analyzed. Please. Please stay. Keep an old man company while he eats one of his last meals. Fine. But it's your turn now. What? What's your mark of the, ya know, very, very, very old? And make it good or this dance is over. The mark of the very old is always the same, young lady. Reflection hampered by immeasurable regret. What's your biggest regret? That it took me until now to realize what I could've learned at your age if I wasn't such an impetuous, horrid little know-it-all. Wow, you just might be the worst new friend maker on the planet. Don't confuse tactics with character. There's only one thing for people like us. If you say it's sweet 16's, we're done for. Ambition. But once you know, you have to live up to it or else. Or else? Liver spots and immeasurable regret? Why run when there's nothing to run from? I'm not running. Those were your words, not mine. It's just an expression. Sure it is. It was nice to meet you, Herman. Keep it. What's up, two socks? Hey. Said you were gonna stop using rigs. It's better this way. Whatever, man, see ya outside. What the fuck man, what? What? I think we're being followed. What am I looking at? Look, those two Mexican dudes down there in that car. What the fuck are you-- stop being paranoid, man. No, look, it rings a bell. What? Z, you're being paranoid, chill the fuck out. Dude, it's just a blue car. No, the two Mexican dudes sat in it all night. I am paranoid, but I'm not wrong about this. Look, I remember them. Oh, motherfucker! Shit. Z, help me, man. What'd I just fucking say about the needles? Yeah, Freddie wouldn't be in jail if you weren't shooting! - What? Z? - Oops. Freddie got popped from that rig she snatched from Otto. You fucking dick. What happened? You OD'd, asshole. Go get ice. - Whoa. - Sorry! Yeah, no. Hey, I know you. Uh, no, I don't think so. No, no, no, I definitely know you. You're friends with Dready Jeff, right? Yeah, kinda. Yeah, what are you doin' here? Um, I'm headed to San Diego. I got arrested yesterday and I managed to make it this far without dying. Oh, shit. You wanna sit down? You wanna have a cup of coffee or something? - Yeah, thank you. - Excuse me, ma'am. Can you get my friend a cup of coffee please? Do you want anything else? You want something to eat? Food or something? Yeah, can I get a cheese Danish please? And a jelly donut and no, that's it. Do you mind? Oh no, go ahead. So ya know, I live in San Diego. I could give you a ride if you want. Seriously? Yeah, ya know, I need the company anyway. That would actually be amazing. Great. Not to be rude or anything but, you kinda look like you could use a bath. Nah, that's just my style. Your style. So, what's in San Diego? A modeling job. Modeling? You serious? No. Well, you know, you could. You ever tried? Yes, actually, I modeled for a mugshot earlier. I looked awesome too. Cute, man. Great, that's what they say about gremlins. Well ya know, I'm totally serious about the modeling thing. I could help you get cleaned up. Come on, man. I kinda need a break from people fucking with me right now. Well, I'm not fucking with you. Seriously, my girl's a stylist. She's really cool. I think you'd really like her and, ya know, honestly, ya kinda look like fuckin' shit. Okay, thank you. Um... Whatever, fine, make me over. Just, um, I need to get to San Diego. Well, San Diego it is. Wanna go? Yeah, okay. Is that your car? Yep. Can I drive? No. Oh, come on, man, really? Come on! - Donny! - No, no, Chuchu, go.

Seriously, I have been arrested, hustled, jerked off on and sold today, all with less than two hours of sleep. So if you kill me right now, I would probably feel so much fuckin' better than I do. So will someone please just tell me what the fuck is going on so if I die right now, at least I know why? Hey, man, shoot her, man. It was for your protection, it was protection. It was about buying protection for the wetback. Sorry, but right? Because one of your boys was killed? Beef, shoot her ass! Man, I shot the last one, alright? I got brain in my eye right now. Oh, but that's right, isn't it? - Fuck it. - Hey, hey, hey. Not happening, fat boy. Oh, my God, please don't fucking shoot each other. Please, please! Just tell me how much money you're fighting over. Shut up, Freddie! No, tell me how much money! Freddie, shut the fuck up. If it's less than $300,000, you all need to fuckin' stop shushing me and hear me out 'cause I've got a story to tell. I'm listening. Hi, Mickey! Oh, it's good to see you. Ya know, I was gonna say sorry for being late on my first day of work, but then I thought, huh, I clocked in hours ago, didn't I? So, uh, no sorries for you. How the hell did you know where I lived? Good trick knows everything about her pimp. But I'm not mad, so, um, why don't you invite me in and I'll tell you everything that happened. Who is it, babe? Hi, I'm Mickey's sister. He doesn't really talk about our side of the family much 'cause he's embarrassed. It's 'cause Mom's a stripper, isn't it? Same old dirty Daddy though. Frank had other kids? No, she's lying. True. He actually drugged me and sold me just this morning to a real ugly fella for $200. That sounds more like the Mickey you know, doesn't it? So what do you want? Oh, Mickey. It's not me that wants it. Boom, boom, boom. It's them. Oh, that was good. Admit it, that was so good. Oh, and they're like totally gonna rob you right now. Yeah. And how did I know where you lived?
