When did you start? - When I was twelve. - Me, at nine. You like it? She wants to be like you. But I put the brakes on her because she's feisty. Just like you. You go to school too? - Yes. - Where? Pompei. What school? I'm in 4th grade. I'm not Italian, I'm from another country, in Morocco. Yeah, I know. Your Italian is good though. Many friends taught me. - No Mom, not that, I want a soda. - Take it... No Mom, no... Why can't I have one like the other kids? Coach, this is from my mom. Where you going? I'm going up for a second. Cheese sandwich first thing in the morning... What is this stuff? Giannanè... So, the third "Elle est francaise" Can I do it? Sure Jamila, go ahead. Est c'est quelle... Ok fine, but let's pronounce better. Est-ce qu'elle, repeat after me. - Est-ce qu'elle... - Est-ce qu'elle... - Est...? - Est-ce qu'elle... Next? Est-ce qu'elle est..? - ...française? - ...est française? Repeat the whole sentence. Est-ce qu'elle est française? Don't keep your right here. Keep it here. My favorite food is French fries, cous cous... Pizza... I also like Coca Cola, and Sprite. And Kinder Bueno... Kinder Bueno is my life. Mom, I'm fed up, tell Dad to buy her a phone of her own. She's your sister, you can share it. No, it's mine, she can't use it all the time. At least let her finish the call. You think she's actually talking to someone? She's just pretending. I don't have time for this. I have to go to work. Bye bye. You guys work all the time and still can't buy a thing. One more minute and you're giving it back. Straight arms... Good job. Straight. In the final minutes her dreams will come true. Her wishes... She'll bring her medal to school to show everyone. They'll look at her with pride. And be happy to be her friend. - But he has a fight. - He has to babysit my little brother. But his match is this Sunday. But why, Coach? I didn't get to come yesterday or Tuesday. It's ok if you skip a day or two. Your brother is the important one now... You're not important in this moment. You can't call him? - He can't come. - Because he has the kid? So go back home. His fight is in two days. Help him out, ok? You can train first, quickly, an hour max. But then go home so he can come. Good? Ok? The winner, on points... Boxe Vesuviana, red corner. Algae spread based on radiation they use for photosynthesis. Ok, stop. Can you explain what you read? I already explained it. You woke me up and I didn't say anything. You made me put this away and I accepted. But now I'm not explaining this, Ask someone else. I think you're a bit rude. I know, thank you. Read it again to yourself, and explain it back to me. Prof, this doesn't make any sense. I don't understand it. What did you say? Say it to my face. Say it now. What's wrong? Take it easy I'll mess you up, all three of you. No, I won't calm down. Who the fuck you think you are? You want to get punched? I'll punch you for real... - Mind your own fucking business. - How dare you... She's messed up in the head... It's Mariella's assistant, can you open please? Good morning. - Blondie, you're late... - Just a half hour... What are we doing? Take off your jacket, prepare the iron, and wash Siria's hair. This is taking forever and now there's no time. No, we'll make it. Mariella, this is why you piss people off. Mariè, the iron's plugged in, can I use your phone? What? You have to wash Siria's hair now. Mariè, just two minutes. Where's my phone, hold on. - You need the password. - I know it already. Here's the truth, you're full of lice. You have bug eyes, you're gross... And you wear that hat so the fleas don't jump out. First of all I don't have lice... Blondie, hurry up. Ok, coming... Lower your head a bit. Alright, put the conditioner in and make a coffee. What about the massage? No, leave the conditioner in for a bit... And put a towel around her so it doesn't drip. Hey sister... Why you back so late? You stay out and I have to stay home and do the chores? Hey, I'm talking to you. Leave me alone, I just got home. Why should I have to do everything? You're never home. Nobody's ever home, why should I be? Coach... What are you doing here? I came to use the shower. - What about school? - I'm going now... Make it fast because hot water costs money. You should start training again, instead of just using our shower. Can I come in? Yeah... I need to see a boxing match. How do I do it? Coach, you got a new phone... And don't know how to use it. You go here. Wait, first do this. Then here where it says Youtube. - Ok, just show me...there! - Wait... That's enough, you found it, explain it later. Hey, you box right? Yeah, why? I see you at Lucio's gym. You box too? No, Lucio's my uncle. I used to box, not anymore. I heard about the fight with Sara and those girls, what happened? Yeah, but I beat them and they didn't get me. You live near The Dome? - Yeah, why? - I thought I saw you with a kid. But I wasn't sure it was you. Yeah, I live there, that's my brother. You're in section D, right? Yeah, section D. I see you in the bathroom. Yeah, I go there when I wanna ditch math. Good idea. You wanna come out with us tonight? We're going to Pompei. No, I'm busy tonight. - What are you doing? - I'm out with my friends. So bring them too... No, they're older, they have a car and we're going to Naples. Peace be upon you. You didn't go to school? There was a strike today. The owner doesn't want you coming here. If she doesn't want me here, what can I do? You think you can just do whatever you want. You only think of yourself and I've had enough. I want you gone in 10 min. Mom, doesn't this place remind you of our house in Morocco? Mom, can I use your phone? Hello Signora, all good? Do you need anything today? But I'm right here outside the supermarket. I'm busy tomorrow, I can only do it today. And later I'm busy, that's why I called you now. Is it heavy? - No, no. - Can you do it? Yes, I can do it. If it's too heavy I can bring it up next time. Signora, the total is 3 and a half euros. Listen, where's the milk and the paccheri? I got spaghetti instead of paccheri. And I got celery instead of milk. Don't make noise, Dad is sleeping. Wait, there's another coin. - Dad is sleeping, you don't get it? - Whatever... He's been at work all day long. Exactly, and he sleeps like a dead man, he won't hear anything. You really think you'll get a ticket to Morocco with this change? No, I'm saving up to give it to you. - You won't make it. - Who says? It costs more than two euros. Why do you wanna go so bad? Angelica, you know already, I like it better in Morocco. You don't even remember Morocco. - Now lend me your phone, please. - No. C'mon, Angè. Give me a euro fifty. Give me a euro fifty. We're sisters and you rent me your phone? I need it. - Ok, so keep it. - Give me a euro fifty. Keep it then. - You can use it until tomorrow. - No, I don't want it now. Ok, fine. - I have plans Saturday night. - With who? - With a guy. - Who? - Alfredo. - Gross, he's like an old man. That's not your problem, just tell Mom we're going out together. You want me to come out and then leave me? You're crazy. - Call a friend or something. - I don't have friends here... They're all in Morocco. You're the one always running from people. So be it... You wanna be better than everyone else. - My dear, what are you doing here? - Hi Ma'am, how are you? Everything good? All good, why are you here? I came to do your hair, Ma'am. Are you with Mariella or alone? Just me. But I have an appointment with Mariella in 2 days. C'mon Ma'am, what's the difference? No, there is a difference. My hair is tricky. But Mariella taught me well, I know what I'm doing. I've cut hair that was down to here. I believe you, but I have an appointment with Mariella. Me and Mariella are the same, it's just hair. Does she know you're here? She'll have time to fill your appointment with someone else. I even brought this backpack with all the tools, it's heavy. I'm sorry, but you just showed up. What can I do? But now I'm here and I'm far from home, Ma'am. You're cute, and I really like you, but let's leave my hair alone. Lift your head, Ma'am. It's even a beautiful day today, see? Yeah... Now twist a bit when you brush so it's not so straight. A bit of volume. I told her that I didn't have my tools. And she said 'but you said that your backpack was heavy.' After the wash I told her that I should style it too. You know I need money. If I want something, I'll get it. What if Mariella finds out? I gotta get that ticket and go. How old are you? Twelve. - But do you parents know? - No, they don't know. It's not possible then. You could travel alone with a permission for minors. I have everything, residence permit, passport, ID card, money. But I can't issue a ticket without your mom and dad. But I want to go alone. You can go alone, but you need your parents' permission. Otherwise I can't issue the ticket. So go tell your mom and dad and you can come back. People don't get it... I get myself. But other people don't. People think one way and I think another. People should take care of their own shit. I'll worry about mine. It's just fighting... We don't kill each other like in some World War. - Where did you do it? - Pompei. - How long did it take? - An hour and a half. C'mon. You take my phone. It's low on battery so go easy. - You going out like that? - Yeah, why? First, because it's cold. And if Dad catches you, leave me out of it. You create the problems and I get the beating. - Don't worry. - We'll see. See you at midnight at the park. Hurry, he's waiting for me. Jamì, I'm busy now. I know what you want. I'll meet you outside. Here's the car, get inside and don't turn it on. Where the fuck have you been? I'm freezing. I fell asleep by mistake. I gave you the phone, I called you twenty times. The battery was dead when you gave it to me. I told you to not use it so I knew where you were. Of course I used it, a phone's not for decoration. It's 3am, Mom will be crazy, let's go. Whatever, an extra chore and she'll forget all about it. No, she's already mad because she lost her job. What? I don't know, they said she stole something. Stole what? I don't know, her boss is full of shit. Let's go. When did they tell her? I don't know, c'mon we have to go. Move it, are you coming or not? - Do you like it? - Yeah... I do. - I left it like you wanted. - Ok. Jasmine, can you come see? How's it going? Nice, eh? - Nice hair do. - Yeah, I like it. A tiny bit less on the tips, but it's nicely done. Good job, Jamila. - So the oil now? - Yeah, a bit of oil. On the tips, remember. Always on the tips. Brava. You wanna take a photo, Ma'am? What photo? With that light... - Is this ok? - Yeah, go ahead. Show her. We post this on my account. - Only if you like it. - No, I like it. It's nice. Tell the truth. But I already gave my share. And it's my money and I can buy what I want. If I want a scooter I'll get it, and new clothes too. Why do you care? It has nothing to do with you, it's my money, mind your own business. Just watch the brakes, they're not built for this speed. No worries It's like riding a bike. Kind of... - Are you from here? - Yeah. Why haven't I seen you? Strange, cause I'm always out and about. - Where do you live? - Near The Dome. My sister's cafe is near there... Nonsolocaffè. - The one with the view? - Yeah, that's my sister's. The sea looks beautiful from there. I like it too. That's the job I want, working on boats, yachts. So why you here? You need connections... I'm getting by with this for now. Where did you get this? I get them used and then alter the motor. Should I take this off? - No, leave it. - Ok. They're not stolen are they? No way, I don't get stolen bikes. Can you take off these pedals? But then it's not a bicycle anymore. But it's not... I know but if you take off the pedals, it's not legal anymore. And you would need a helmet and a license. - So how much for this? - 400. It's so cute. - You like it? - Yeah. - What is it? - It's a Goldfinch. What's its name? Maradona. - Pet it with your finger. - No Don't be scared. Why don't you clean it? I'm not putting my hands in there. It's been there forever, way before me. How about 300? 300? Make it 350... 350 try it, if you like it, I'll bring it to you. 330. 340. Ok bring it to me Tuesday. Ok, tell me where. - You leaving on your own? - Yeah. - Wait, I'll bring you with the bike. - No, I'll get the train, it's easy. - No, the bike is faster. - Don't worry, I'm used to the train. - We'll be faster with this. - No, really... - See, it's running well. - What? - It's running well, right? - Now it is... But you really have to pedal a lot. Keep in mind we're riding double. What's going on, why did it die? The battery's dead. Does it always die like that? No, it's because I thought I had charged it overnight but I didn't. You better give it to me with a good battery. The battery is good, I just didn't charge it enough. Listen, I'll just walk the rest. No, alone on foot? No, really, the shop has to open. Wait, let me see if I can get some help and charge it. No, really, the shop must be open. I'm sorry it died. No worries, bring it to my salon on Tuesday. Ok, I'll bring it. It'll be fully charged. - Change the battery for me. - I'll change it. I already put sugar in. - You put half, I like it with more sugar. - No, I put the whole packet. No prob. That's too much sugar, you're ruining it. I like it like this. It wakes me up. That's gross. No way, good God. It'll wake you up too...get you working. Simo, hurry up, clients are coming. But we still have 10 minutes. Move it, you're even leaving early today. Where you going? I signed up for an English course in Naples. What do you mean English course? A course to learn English. Another place for you to go and gossip. Yes, yes. You only learn "yes." We have Mrs. Coppola tomorrow morning? - Yes. - I'll prepare the color now. No, do it tomorrow. Let's hurry. Here's for today. And an extra five since you worked hard. Thanks. Clean those brushes and I'll give you a ride. Not in the car, I don't want a mess. You got enough for everybody? - Yeah, five pizzas for the five of us. - Good. I gave you a phone and now it's all you do. Put it away, let's talk. Hold on... - Jasmine, can I ask you something? - Speak. When was your first boyfriend? Why? - Just because... - Is someone after you? No, I'm just curious. First boyfriend... At 16, but I wasn't actually in love. It was just a random crush. The first love is when your heart pounds. Was that with your husband? Of course, otherwise I wouldn't have married him, right? And because he's a good guy. But did you know that before your heart pounded? No, I didn't know. So how did you know? I collected information on him. But if he's not a good guy, don't let your heart pound at all. Otherwise you'll be visiting him in jail. Instead of a pounding heart, you'll just be crying. Anyway you're too young to think about love. Now you need a trade. You learn how to cut hair... You find a good guy... And you start a relationship. - Here, I'll put on Killer Doll for you... - No. This for you, and this for me. Why so much? Since Jasmine was buying I got some extras. Who's gonna eat all this? So what, more for us... You're not hungry? This pizza is cold. Where did you get it? Free pizza from Jasmine and you're complaining? Jasmine bought me pizza, Jasmine got me a phone... Jasmine gave me a ride, mamma mia. At least Jasmine is my friend. Here, nobody even thinks about me. You should be in school, instead of working full time. It's not like you're some Professor. At least I finished middle school. What does that get you? Have you thought about the thing with Dad? Whatever, Uncle Usman is all talk. No, it's not. I heard them on the phone together. Don't bother me, I just got back from work. I'm tired and don't wanna hear it. I created two new accounts. Now I have four. Why? Don't know, just to have them. Look, yesterday I posted this photo and got 200 likes. You're an influencer now? My God, look who's in a relationship now. Her... Really... I'm cute and sparkly but single, and this trash is in a relationship. Don't hide from showing who you really are. My friends, don't hide. If he's the one, dive in. Show him your imperfections too. Remember the proverb: There is a crack in everything, but that's where the light shines through. Always remember that. Remember the proverb: There is a crack in everything, but that's where the light shines through. You want some? I'm dieting. You diet even though you're skinny. Take some. I don't like rice. Now this guy wrote me. Let's see. This one. Hey, not bad... You know what happens with these hot ones, my dear? They get possessive. If someone tries to control me, I'll ditch them in a second. I'm gonna eat my chips. - C'mon, let's go. - I don't feel like it today. Ok let's take a selfie first. Put on your lips. This way... Wheel. Loco, loco. The glass. Haha, the glass... Heart. That's it... We did it. Where do I fit her in tomorrow? We already have two clients at 11. But at 11 they just need color. As soon as it's in I can still wash and blow-dry. Ok, so I'll put her at 11 too. Jamì, I gotta go. Let me do it for you. I'll do these two. It's hot. Listen, while I'm out next week... Keep your eye on Simona. She talks too much while she cuts. She needs to pay more attention, make sure she does a good job. Write everything down in the agenda. Name, last name. Phone number, and what they need done. Basically, when I'm not here, you do what I usually do. - Keep your eye on the shop. - Ok, I will. Pay attention to all details, and don't forget anything. And who will do the complicated cuts? Anita. - Anita will be here? - Yes, Anita too. Ok, we're done. Wait, these ones in front. No, they look good. I'm leaving you the keys... You open the shop Tuesday morning. Sounds good. Clean the wash stations, mirrors, turn everything off, the heating units too. Ok. - Don't forget. - Don't worry. - Hey, I'm here even when I'm gone. - Ok, have a good night. Ok ciao ciao. See, it's better with the pedals. Slow down before turning. - You like it? - It goes pretty fast. I told you, it goes faster with the pedals. Good thing you didn't take them off. 300... 320... Ok that's enough, 320. Why? You said 340. No problem, I left you stranded the other day. Yeah, but I got to the shop on time. Don't worry about it. Just one thing about the battery I didn't tell you... You can't take it out. You have to charge it on the bike. Ok. Just figure out how to reach it. No worries. So listen... Would you come meet me on Thursday? - Where? - On a boat. A boat? A tiny boat, but there's room for both of us. And what do we do with a boat? We'll go out to the rocks by the port. But I have work then. You can't get a half day off? It's tricky asking my boss that. You want me to come ask? No, that would be worse. I have to go, I have clients soon. Wait, one second. I almost forgot. I brought you this too. Trust me, you have to use it. Where's the key? The key's next to the bike key. Ok, nice, thanks. So what about Thursday? I don't know, I'll try and ask. I'll be at the small pier at midday. Do you like it, Ma'am? All good...to be honest, I like it a lot. Brava. - How old are you? - 13. Just 13, you're so tall, mamma mia. She's a tower. Better to be in here than out on the streets. Did you see what happened where I live? They mugged a kid. Four guys messed him up. Last night? Yeah, there was all this yelling and his mom and dad even showed up. A mess. I blame the TV. People are losing their minds. 20 years of that church show didn't turn out one priest. 4 years of Gomorrah and now all the kids are criminals. Simona, yeah, she's doing a good job... But she's vaping inside. It's just an E-cigarette, no big deal. But just so you know. Mom, I'm not going, send Jamila with Dad. Lower your voice... Jamila, you're the one who can go to Morocco. I have a job, and my boyfriend. Our brother is working far from home... Mom needs to stay with Ayoub. You're the only one who can go. When I was happy in Morocco, you all dragged me here. Now I'm happy here and you want to send me back? Mom, stop this, I'm not going. You don't get it, we all have our papers now. So why should Dad keep on busting his ass for nothing? Your father is doing this for both of you, we must help him. Mom, I'm not going to Morocco. You just get up and leave? So Dad gets a good job in Morocco and you won't even help him get settled? Get off my back. I have Jasmine here. You should go. You were dying to go back to Morocco and now you want to stay in that shop. You only care about work. Who's more important? Dad or Jasmine? What kind of question is that? And why do you care so much all of a sudden? You're not interested in our family. You're never home for lunch on Friday with Dad. You never look after our younger brother... Not to mention the trouble you caused for Mom. That has nothing to do with it. And Mom knows that it wasn't my fault. You know what you did. You think you're some saint? I'm not stupid, I know what you do with Alfredo. Get out of my business... You're the one going to Morocco. What's the big deal about Pompei...we have it all right here. Besides the ruins it's just one big sewer. A 3 month project... Co-co-co...Chee-chee-pee Po-po-po...Lo-lo-lo What a joke... You wanna smoke? Mr. Superintendent... Doesn't even speak English, what's he supposed to superintend? The girls are done. I gotta go, the keys are upstairs. So you close up, do you have a lot left? Just this. Should I finish tomorrow or today? Finish now because the painter is coming tomorrow. So how will the nail salon be down here? Nice, but the ceiling's a bit low. No, it'll be good. It'll be a busy week, you can use the cot if you ever want to sleep here. Tomorrow, today, the whole week, whenever you want. I don't want you to be late, too much back and forth and train schedules. No, I have a scooter now, I'll be fine. Watch out, I don't want you to get hurt. How would we ever finish the remodel? Ok, I'll see later this evening. My mistake? You messed up the last letter. Good morning. This is the file your designer sent me. - You and my designer have to fix it. - I'll show you the messages. - I don't care. - Look at the spelling here. I don't give a fuck, it's a mistake. - What happened? - Take it up with him, not me. I'm taking it up with both of you. I'm not putting this up. They messed up the last letter. Instead of California, they wrote Californie. But the sign is done. I know it's done, and I don't like it, it should say California. So call your designer because the error is not my fault. You can't do anything about it? I can't fix this. - So you have to make it again. - Then you pay for it again. No, no. Maybe it's ok, like that proverb: "Where there's a crack there is also light." Don't start with proverbs... - What if I give you a discount? - I gotta think about it. - How much of a discount? - I could do the installation for free. Installation for free? Installation for free plus 100 euros off. I don't know, I have to think about it. It's unique. It seems intentional. Just tell her and I'll cover for you. I'm worried she'll fire me. So what? You put in so many hours and get paid so little. Find another job. Who will hire a 13 year old? She took me on at 13. I think you get paid too little for what you're worth. The same goes for you, we get paid the same. Yeah, but I need the money, to move to Florence with my aunt. Why, you speak French? What's French gotta do with it? They don't speak French in Florence? Florence is in Italy, they speak Italian. And they pay more too. Same difference for me. I like Torre and I wanna stay in Torre. Up to you, love... Angè, move it, I have to close, you'll miss your chance. - So this is the bike? - Yeah, you like it? Why is it inside? It's charging. Look here... For night-time. It turns on here, like that. Listen. It looks slow, but when I do this Like this. - Wait, so it's charging now? - Yeah. - Here? - Yeah. Look, I can even put groceries here. It's nice. When you go to Morocco, I'll use it. - No, I'm not going to Morocco. - We'll see... He invited me on his boat and I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to say yes because I don't know him. But if I say no I lose the chance to get to know him. So what did you say? I said I don't know. And when will you tell him? He said to meet at the port tomorrow morning. Have you ever been on a boat? No, never. See, I'm younger than you and already going on a boat. Lucky you. What would you do if you were invited on a boat but had to work? I would go. And what would you tell your boss? I would take a day off or say I had a fever. I would go. I should be able to go. What are you scared of? Stop shitting yourself and get on. You're a bad driver, I might fall. C'mon, get on. Get on and if you don't like my driving, you can get off. And what if Dad sees us? Don't worry, we'll leave it in Teresa's building next door. Ok, let's go. Let's take a selfie. Don't post it though. No, it's to show Alfredo. He's getting possessive, watch out. Let's go. - Does it burn or hurt? - It hurts, really. Open your mouth. It's a bit red. - Have you ever been to a dentist? - No. Doc, if you have time, I'll send her right now. It'd be a huge favor, this week is crazy and I need the girl. She's ready, already getting her jacket. She's getting ready. You're so nice, thank you. Ok, ciao, ciao. I told you that I already know a dentist. No, I already called, he's good. Don't worry, just go. It's not better to use the one I know? Don't make me look bad, get your jacket and go. - Have you ever been to the dentist? - Never. - How old are you? - Thirteen. What's the problem? My tooth hurts a lot. - Where's the pain? - Here. - Back right? - Yes. Open your mouth. - Do you ever brush your teeth? - Every now and then. Do you only wash your face now and then too? You must brush after every meal. - Does it hurt here? - Yes, a lot. Do I need to stay home for the pain to go away? The pain is not that bad... But it really hurts, otherwise I wouldn't be here. I know it's real, but it doesn't hurt a lot. But it's bothersome. I'll give you some medicine, and it will go away. And I'll talk to Jasmine. No, don't tell her, it's my own business. I will because you are young and need to be supervised. Listen, I can't come today. I have customers at the shop and they need me. And it's a busy next few days... I don't think I'll have any time to meet up, so don't worry about it. Jamila, help out with the luggage. Said, let's go Yeah, just a moment. Ayoub. Jamila. - Bye Dad. - Bye. Hey, where you going? Jamila, where are you going? Answer me, where you going? Are you crazy? I told you last time, she can't be here in the morning. But where will she go if she's not here? If she's not in school she's better off here. - Ms. Giovanna - Jasmine, not Giovanna. But she's in your shop instead of being in school. It's not even legal. I'm not her mom, I can't make her go. This isn't child exploitation. A 13 year old shouldn't be wandering around Torre, she's better off with me. Do you know her parents? I can't track them down. Yeah, I know them. - What time are they home? - They both work until late. - Do you have a number for them? - No, I don't. - Ok, can I speak with her? - Yes, come with me. No, in private. - Just you and her? - Yes. Wait here a moment. Simo, take the gentleman to the back. Jamì, this social worker is a pain in the ass. What does he want? Just tell him you work here in the afternoon. Don't say you come in the mornings. - Is your cell the same? - Yes. - I have 338 571 2832 - Yes. Ok, so...date of birth. 03/09/2007 - Immediate family members? - What's that? How many in your family? There are six of us. Last time we met you were complaining about your heating, do you have it now? Yes, one for the whole house. Is it central heating or a single heater? - I can't remember what it's called. - Ok. - Do you have hot water? - No. So... How long have you all been in Italy? My dad has been here 10 years... Actually, 13 years. The rest of us, six years. - So your dad was first here alone? - Yes. Did you ever see him in that period? He wasn't there when I was born. He came when I was three or four but I didn't recognize him. Ok, so at elementary school everything was going fine, you were behaving. But at middle school you started having problems. I see suspensions and bad behavior. And you haven't even gone to school since October. - Do you want to tell me what happened? - Nothing happened. - Are you sure? - Yes. It's strange things changed so dramatically. I don't like that school. I don't like school in general. What do you mean? Listen, I have to write things here that are important for your future. These papers go to the juvenile court. You have to tell me the truth. What does your dad do for work? In the morning at the open market, and in the evenings... He's a cleaner... Or he was a cleaner. What do you mean "was"..? He left. Where to? Morocco. - By himself? - Yes. But why? Now you're here with your whole family... - Your mom and your siblings? - Yes. - So why? - Because Dad found a job there. - Is that why you're sad? - Yeah, I feel sorry about it... I let him go alone. - That means that you care about him - But I never told him that. Listen, we both know you're not going to school. And we don't think you'll go anytime soon. Because in October you told us you'd go, but you never did. Now it's January... Now we have to find a solution. You know that you have to be at school in the mornings. You can't come here. But if I don't come here in the mornings Jasmine will fire me. The law is clear. The morning you go to school. You can still come here in the afternoons. But in the mornings, you absolutely must be in school. You sure it's good quality? Yeah, a lot of people have bought this one. So you gonna buy it? Yeah, but I need some other things. Ok, you can leave it here. Hello Madam...hello? Fine, thanks, how are you? Everything fine? I wanted to ask you since I'm here at a shop... What should I bring, do you know? And what about shampoo and shower gel? Hey Suzy... Jamì, what are you doing here? I'm looking for Ciro, he's not in today? No, but he'll be here tomorrow. Want me to tell him something? He still owes me 40 euros and now I'm leaving town. Should I have him call you? I'm leaving today... - Where you going? - Cosenza. Cosenza? Where is that? I don't know but they sent me photos and it's a nice city. Here take a look... See here. No shit... Nice. Nice going, Jamila. And where's this? Who's that girl with the headscarf? That's my sister who went back to Morocco. So what you going to do there? I'm gonna work in a home. - Babysitting? - No, it's an old woman. - So you'll be a caregiver? - Yes. I have two friends who did that job. Taking care of old people is tough. But maybe you'll like playing cards and spending your Sunday in the kitchen. I'll be ok, and with 600 euros a month in a year I can open a hair salon. You? You're too little for that. Wait and see, in a year I'll invite you to my salon. Ok, I'll count on it. Ok, I gotta run and get the bus. See you. Alright, lemme give you a hug. - Bye sweetie, have a good trip. - Thanks. Coach... Coach... Miracle that you answered, Coach It's Jamila... Where are you, Coach? Are you coming to the gym? So you're not coming? Hi Dad, how's it going? I wanted to tell you that I took that job, the one out of town. I'm gonna use my first salary to get a new washing machine for Mom. They're on sale now. Poor thing, she works so hard... I want to surprise her. I'll send her my first salary so she can buy it herself. How's everybody down there? I swear I miss you all a lot.
