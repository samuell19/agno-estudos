prepared a spot in the cemetery Hallowed Ground Give it to me What has a tongue of a serpent Yes I was at my father when I return to my rectory I went through book after book looking for Clues finally I found an image of the Seal of death The image you see on the face of the clock some Mark of Death itself UC I discovered that the clock is but one of four on a holy object Anointed with the blood of Jesus Christ Infused with the blood of God himself The Old Testament warned us about these four objects the crown of thorns set high upon the head of Christ in Conquest the dry dead Voyager of the crucifix represented fan The Roman soldier spear represented War The spikes that nailed him to the Cross they were deaf Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Objects This clock was one of those. Meat from the iron spikes to crucify Jesus Are you going to perform an exorcism No it would be useless in this case Countless souls and demons are trapped within it what are we going to do that Waitress from existence with this It's a solution of hydrofluoric and sulfuric acid that I have also blessed Juju Theology wasn't all I studied at you Sober
