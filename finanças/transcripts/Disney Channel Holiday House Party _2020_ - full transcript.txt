Hey there, everyone. I am so excited to be hosting tonight's very special holiday edition of "House Party." The holidays are all about spreading love and joy and positivity, and we figured what better way to do so than with some laughs. I love this time of year because it's an opportunity for everyone to take a breath and say to themselves, "How can I be a better, more compassionate person today?" And I think that that is just so-- Sorry. My neighbor seems to be mowing his lawn at night, for some reason. I guess that's what happens when you film at home, folks. As I was saying, this time of year, it is so nice to see people-- Okay. For crying out-- Hey! Jerry! I am trying to film a TV show over here, okay? And you are making a lot of noise! Sorry, I can't hear you! This thing makes a lot of noise! Right, yeah. So you think maybe you could turn it off? Happy holidays to you, too, Miranda. For crying out loud, Jerry. As I was saying, compassion, togetherness, love for your fellow human. Christmas is the best time of year. I'll be back later to spread some holiday cheer, and stay tuned, because we've got a really exciting show in store for you. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Welcome back to my channel, coming to you from my home studio. Sorry I didn't upload last week. It was my great-grandpa's birthday, and I watched him eat soup the whole time. Blech. However, today on "Skylar Reviews," is the "Total Smash or Pure Trash" Christmas special. First up, the Christmas classic, we've got mistletoe. Excuse me, but it's 2020. We have rights. And plants cannot tell us who to kiss anymore. Trash! I am the Ghost of Christmas Past. And you are a very self-absorbed, toxic 13-year-old girl. I've been sent here to change your ways. Tonight, you shall be visited by three spirits. No, I'm recording tonight. Tell the spirits to come back later. I, wh-- What? We, we can't come back later. -Uh, we're spirits. We can only visit-- -Okay, bye. All right. Chestnuts roasting on an open fire... is a great way to burn all your chestnuts! Trash! Skylar! I am the Ghost of Christmas Present! Ugh! Stop. No! I must show you the error of your ways! Get out of the shot. Both of you! Go, like, stand by the wall or whatever. Uh, um, okay. Is this better? Quiet! Okay. The 12 days of Christmas. First of all, okay, there's only one day of Christmas, so already, trash! -Um, uh, I-- -Shush! Okay, time to un-box my presents. Let's see what my sister Carol got. A new phone! From 2019! Trash. -Okay. Here's my dad's present. -Ooh! Ooh! I am the Ghost of Christmas Future. Ugh. Stop! She's mean. Uh, tell her what happens in the future. Listen up, missy. I just got back from the future, Skylar. And if you continue down the path you're on, you'll end up alone, with no family or friends. Am I rich? Well, yes, but-- you don't have any family or friends, or anybody that cares about you. -But I'm still rich, right? -Well... -Yeah, but-- -Sweet. Fine by me. Anyways, that's our episode. I gotta bounce. Follow my channel. Bye! Hi. I'm Ruby Rose Turner. It's Isaac Ryan Brown from "Raven's Home." Hi, I'm Scarlett Estevez. I'd seen all the Disney stars doing their wand IDs, but when they asked me, it was, like, crazy. But, uh, all around, it is a total honor to be asked to do a Disney Channel wand ID. I used to do them in my bedroom with a pencil all the time as a kid. I can't believe I actually got to do one in real life. I'd been dreaming of this day for as long as I can remember. I just-- Things didn't quite pan out as I imagined. Excuse me. While I was shooting, I accidentally inhaled some of the magic dust, so I-- This happens now. You know, no one told us you're not supposed to inhale this stuff. Everybody knows you're not supposed to inhale the magic dust. There are big signs saying, "Don't inhale the magic dust," on every wall. And on the bottle. And each of us are required to watch a 45-minute safety DVD titled: "Do Not Inhale the Magic Dust." I don't actually remember how it happened. Um, but since it was in between takes, I don't know if we'll ever know. No, no, no. The camera was rolling. Check it out. Gotcha. Let's go one more time, all right? And action. What up, everybody? I'm Trevor Tordjman, and you are watching Disney Channel. Ha, ha! - We got it. Thanks. - Oh! Man, this thing is so sick! Hey, man, you want me to, like, ad lib a little bit - on the next one? - No, I think we're good. Like, I could do, like, a bow and arrow. Or, no. A flute. Oh! Oh. I think inhaled a little bit of it. Is that bad? Is it bad? The other Disney Channel actors? Yes, they've been very understanding. And just, just all around cool about the whole situation. Bro, who breathes the dust, bro? I don't-- I just-- You should have seen his face. He was like, "Aah! Help me! Help me!" "I need some tissue." They say it should only last about another two weeks. Um... So, until then, I guess I just have to deal with-- Just have to deal with this. Sorry, can you excuse me? Just gonna run to the bathroom really quick. Oh, I'm sorry! Those sketches really made me laugh. I'm laughing right now just thinking about them. We've got more gut-busters coming up, so stay tuned, and we'll be right back. You've seen the high school stories, but now we're taking things way back to bring you our latest D-COM, "Pre-School Musical." Even though they're in pre-school, there's still plenty of drama. Mm, yeah! "Pre-School Musical" has a soundtrack full of chart-topping hits like: "Pre-School Musical." Coming to Disney Channel Summer 2021. Welcome back to "House Party," the only show where you, the audience, are not permitted to use the restroom until it ends. I've had this big book of Christmas fairy tales in my family for generations. And I figured reading one of my favorite stories out loud might be a good way to spread some holiday cheer. All right. It's called-- Oh. Whoops. Better put my phone on vibrate. Sorry. Where was I? Okay, sorry about that. I should probably just turn this bad boy off. Great. Now we can focus on the story without any-- Okay. Hello? What? I'm in the middle of spreading holiday cheer. - This better be pretty good. - Hello. You have been selected to take a brief survey-- I don't have time for this! Let's just go to the next sketch. So, now our parents said they have to move. Ugh. Tragic. I would never. Oh, sweet! Becxxi Bexxers is going live. Who's Becxxi Bexxers? Are you being for serious right now? Becxxi Bexxers is the biggest thing. How have I not heard of her? No idea. She makes the best dance videos. And she's always wearing this big flower crown. That's so cool. It is so cool. Here. I'll screen share. Hey, there, Becxx-Nation! We got a totally lit new dance routine for you today. This one is straight fire, and not cringe at all. Dude, she's like, old. No, she isn't. She's wearing a flower crown. Okay. I call this one "The Wiggly Waggler." You just stick your left foot out and slide, then you tuck, then bend. Then repeat. Okay, let's slide. Then tuck. Then bend. Then repeat. And then you do this really cool thing, where you grab a thank you card and thank your grandma for the check she sent you for your birthday. Wait! See, that is not cool. Yes, it is. It's just part of the dance. Then you slide to the right and you tidy up your room. 'Cause the last thing your mom needs after a long day at work is to clean up after you. -Okay, let's clean. -Right there. That's Mom-speak. I'd recognize it anywhere. What? She's just talking about cool kid stuff, like cleaning your room and thanking your nana. That's exactly what moms want you to think is cool. I'm telling you, that's a mom. Look! Her jeans have an elastic waist! I... don't believe it. You're right! Becxxi Bexxers is a mom! And not just any mom. Lana, I'm pretty sure that's your mom. Wait a minute. And repeat. To the side, then slide... Then bend, then back. Then repeat. Okay, let's slide. Then bend. Mom! Mom! Mom! I'm not, I'm not your mom! I'm Becxxi Bexxers! Clean up your room! It's Christmas! The door security camera caught something last night! Ho, ho, ho! Oh! Whoa! Oh! Oh. Oh! Jiminy Christmas, that hurt! Uh, hello? Anyone home? It's, it's me. Santa. I was, uh, hoping that someone might be home so I could go through the house. Ooh! Ho, ho, I think I really sprained my arm. Oh, I'm not gonna be able to climb up there now. I'll just go around back and look for a ladder, and-- Yeah. I'll get up there somehow. Oh! I'm sorry. I just want to see if there's a ladder or something-- Oh, no, down, girl! Oh! Ow! Aah! Gah! Gah! Ooh! Not the suit! Not the suit! Ah, puppy! Aah! Ho-ho. Oh, no! Oh. Oh, hi. It's, uh, me again. I, uh, I found the ladder. Boy, that is one intense dog you've got. He's definitely going on my naughty list. That's for sure. Look at this coat! Anyway, uh, got my ladder, so... Gotta go up there and get back on my sleigh. Okay. Ho, ho, ho. Hey! My reindeer friends. Hey, it's Santa. Oh, oh, no! Aah! Ooh. Oh. Oh, I think I-- I think I've sprained the other arm. I might have broken it. Are you sure there's nobody in there? And... there go my reindeer. Oh, that's just perfect. Oh. Guess I won't be getting any presents this year. We gotta take a quick break, but make sure to come right back, because we've got bananas, eggs, milk, tuna salad, baby... carrots. Okay, there seems to have been a mistake, and I am now reading the teleprompter guy's grocery list. Oh, my bad. Just come on back. We've got more good stuff in store for you. Don't forget to take the chicken out of the freezer at 4 p.m. to thaw, okay? I got it, I got it. Oh, no! I forgot to thaw the chicken! Don't let this happen to you! Forgetting to take the chicken out to thaw is a thing of the past with "Oops, I Forgot" app from LazyLad Industries. Let's try that again. But this time, Annabelle is armed with the "Oops, I Forgot" app. Just hit the "Oops, I Forgot" button, and our patented parent-diversion technology gets to work right away. -Mrs. Harris. -Um, yes. Can I help you? My name is Commander McLaughlin. I'm with the United States Extra-Terrestrial Defense Force. I need you to accompany me to Fort Belvoir right away. Wait, what's this all about? Ma'am, an alien invasion is imminent. And legends have foretold that you, Andrea Harris, are The Alien Slayer, the only person capable of stopping them. Me? The fate of the planet rests in your hands. There's no time for delay. Come with me! With Mom busy thinking she's saving the world, you'll have plenty of time to let that chicken thaw. While we're turning Mom into a lean, mean, alien-fighting machine, your chicken is thawing, assuring you and your family a delicious dinner tonight. Once it's thawed, just let us know, and we'll send Mom home. Okay, troops! We're nearing the drop zone! Let's show these moon men we mean business! - Hello? - Andrea! A bit of a mix-up on our end. Turns out the legend was actually talking about, uh... a different Andrea Harris. Our bad. You're free to head home. Thawed the chicken, just like you asked. Thanks, honey. Thanks, "Oops, I Forgot." Welcome back to the show. Have we had some fun tonight, or what? Now, I know that things haven't exactly gone according to plan on the "me spreading holiday cheer" front, so I said to myself, when I think of the holidays, what brings the biggest smile to my face? Lighting the Christmas tree, of course! Shall we? This is gonna look so beautiful. Okay, turn it on! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, uh-- I, I got it. I got it! Oh, I do not got it! Let's just get back to the fun... ♪ I love to sing and dance all day ♪ ♪ Even when it's cold and gray ♪ ♪ Being with your friends is mighty fine ♪ ♪ Welcome to "Mr. Merry and Friends Happy Time" ♪ Hey there, kids. It's your old friend Mr. Merry, here. And thanks for coming back to "Happy Time." All my friends are here today. Jumpy the Bunny, Nuzzles the Chicken, Reno the Dog, and of course, Solomon the Cat. Yeah. Hey. How's it goin'? If I seem even happier than usual, it's because tomorrow is my favorite day of the year! Christmas! Yippee-a-roo! I love Christmas. But I've got a little problem. I don't know what present to get for my best friend, Eloise the Eagle. She's been leaving me hints all week, but I can't figure it out. So I need you kids at home to help me. So far, the hints I have are: ice, skates, and an ice rink with a person ice skating on it. This one's pretty hard. Can you at home help me figure it out? Dude! Are you for real? This is a new low. Even for you, Mr. Merry. I might need to ask my friends for help. It's ice skates. Ice skates. It couldn't be any more obvious. It's no use, Reno. He doesn't understand animals. Ice. Hmm. You think she wants ice cream? How does this guy live on his own? I mean, I'm seriously concerned that he has a driver's license. Guys! He's trying his best. Whether we like it or not, Mr. Merry's the one who feeds us. And until that changes, we're dependent on this very, very, very unintelligent man. Okay, don't be mean. Skates! Hmm. Maybe she wants a skate made out of ice! That's it. I'm gonna bite him. I swear, if he gets near me, I am going to bite his butt. That's probably not it, either. But we're out of time, so I guess we'll never know. Hope you learned a lot today! No one learned anything. -No one ever learns anything! -I'm Mr. Merry. And we'll see you real soon. And have a Merry Christmas! Ugh. I'm gonna go keep trying to dig under the fence out back. Oats. Soy. Hemp. Almonds. Ever wonder why Mom only buys milk made out of boring stuff? I was just wondering that! Well, now you can make milk out of anything! Just in time for Christmas, it's the Milk-O-Rator! Whoa! What's your favorite food, Davey? Chocolate cake! Just put it in the Milk-O-Rator! Aah. Whoa! Chocolate cake milk! And what else do you like to eat? Pepperoni pizza! Just put it in the Milk-O-Rator! Yay, pizza milk! Ugh. It's really chunky. It just tastes like grease water! Now, can you guess what kind of milk kids all over the country are going bananas for? Banana milk? I understand why your mind went there, but heck, no. Hot dog milk! Just put it in the Milk-O-Rator! - I'm not sure I wanna drink hot-- - I said, "Put it in the Milk-O-Rator." [Announcer, cheerily Go on! Take a sip! Go on! Ugh. It just tastes like meat water. But wait! The Milk-O-Rator can do so much more! Sick of taking out the trash? I really hope you're not gonna tell me to-- Just put it in the Milk-O-Rator. Nobody wants trash milk! Dad! Your dad isn't here, Davey. - What'd you do with him? - He's fine. Just put the trash in the Milk-O-Rator, and everything will be okay. Yum! Now hold it up to the camera, and tell all the kids at home to get themselves a Milk-O-Rator today for just $499.99. - No kid is gonna wanna pay-- - Say it! - I'm not gonna say it! - Uh, uh... Get your Milk-O-Rator today, for just $499.99. Or else. Well, that's our show. What an amazing evening this has been. We hope that you were able to relax, and experience some Christmas cheer with us, as we-- Oh, forget it. On behalf of all of us at Disney Channel-- Excuse me. Is anyone at home? Anyone at all? I'm out here. It's cold. I think I might have broken my arm. I have no way of getting back to the North Pole-- Okay, can someone please mute whoever that is? I've got no means of transportation-- -Muted. -Thank you. Like I was saying, on behalf of all of us at Disney Channel... -Merry Christmas. -And happy holidays. Happy holidays, and goodnight, guys. -Merry Christmas. -And happy holidays. -Goodnight. -Happy holidays! -Merry Christmas. -And happy holidays. -Have a good night. -Goodnight!
