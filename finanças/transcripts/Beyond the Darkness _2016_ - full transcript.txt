Life is a series of moments where every thought, every word, and every action ripples throughout eternity. Love knows no boundaries. There is a battle between the light and the darkness that rages for each soul. The gift of life stands before you, and one day, the light will reveal all things. Jonah? Jonah? Jonah, no! Jonah! There was a big battle on the senate floor yesterday as freshman senator, Jonah Thomas, the rising star in the Senate, vehemently opposed Senator Rushton's tax increase stating that raising taxes on the already over-burdened American family was like a declaration of war against its citizens. Here's more from Senator Thomas. Well, the American citizens won a small victory today. If my colleagues in the Senate actually had the guts and the integrity to truly represent the interests of the people and not their own, we'd be well on our way to makin' this country great again. Senator Rushton is not one to give in easily, stating that his proposal would help stimulate the US economy. He is on a mission. I want him out of the picture. It's got teeth. There's no way they can prove it's not true. Just give me a day to set it in motion. Make it happen this afternoon. I think Senator Rushton's gonna come after me. Hey, Pam. This better be good, Winston. You know I don't like to be bothered when I'm out here. Thought you might like to know that your hunch was correct. Baker's office has been in contact with this woman for months. Jane Isner. Now she's Richards' new personal assistant. She's Baker's insider. How'd you make the connection? Called in a few favors. All strictly legal. Um... Every path to Baker is a dead end. Baker used to be FBI before he became a senator. He knows all the methods, but I have a secret weapon. -What's that? -You. But I'm just a consultant. Exactly, you're not really FBI. Keep fishing. I wanna know how Baker fits in to all of this. What do we use as bait? I've got a team going after Richards. He's having a secret meeting about his vaccine bill today. Dirty money and everything. Why haven't they taken any steps to balance the budget? Our national debt is spiraling out of control. Today was an unfortunate setback. I'm fighting for the little guy here. This battle is sure to continue, but most would agree round one goes to Senator Thomas. - Yeah, everything looks great. - The numbers look great. Yeah, well, the lawyers have to approve everything but we need to get together. The FBI doesn't know about the second vaccine. I'll make sure it stays that way. Okay. Senator Baker? Sir? It's going down this morning. Sanders is really focused on this one. The pressure's high. -You wanna come along? -I'm hunting big game today. Bigger game than three US senators? I'm expecting a briefing at four. I'll see you at four. Happy hunting. The cancer vaccine stops or cures 99 percent. Your father happens to fall in the 1 percent. You have no idea how much suffering my father has gone through because of their so called cancer-curing vaccine. We should talk later when cooler heads prevail. I'm giving you the opportunity to be the hero. 10 million is pocket change in comparison to the windfall they're about to have. How do I know you'll hand over all the data on the vaccine? How can I trust you? Trust. Trust goes both ways. This needs to happen today. Even they don't have that kind of money sitting around. Besides, they haven't passed the bill yet. It'll pass. I'll bring all the data and we'll all sign the papers together. Deal? We have a deal. They have a meeting at the Artisan penthouse around 11. Senator Williams likes the chefs, so they'll have a late lunch. Be there at 1:30, no sooner. I'll be there. The hotel is closed for renovations. I'll leave a message at the front desk for you to be escorted to the penthouse. If I sense that there's any trouble, I'll leave and release the information. Understood? Understood. What if they release the data? How do you think they got the data in the first place? Our vaccine is perfect. Senator Richards' vaccine is flawed. It's terribly flawed and we've got to do something about it. Just keep us up to date on all the details. Will do. Thank you, gentlemen. You called it. They're meeting at the Artisan today. They should be the only ones there. No civilian casualties. You don't have to go. I can do it myself. Dad, there's no turning back. I'm the one that convinced you to take it in the first place because they guaranteed me it would work. Look, I want them to pay just as much as you do. Senator McLuster talked about the possible human suffering from the vaccine as a risk-versus-reward scenario as if he were talking about sacks of potatoes. They're getting off easy as far as I'm concerned. You're gonna have to finish the last two. Well, if it looks, talks, and walks like a duck, it's a duck. In this case, it's a pig. What? Today? Hold on. Yeah, well, what time? Two o'clock? Yeah, no problem. I don't have anything important scheduled at two. I can make that, no problem. Yeah, well that's what I was trying to tell you. It just makes sense. I mean, we gotta hold these people accountable. Sorry for the impromptu gathering, but we've had some important meetings come up this morning. I was able to push back the retool meeting to ten o'clock, and I just heard you snagged a two o'clock -on the pure water project? -Mm-hm. I thought that would never happen. You said you were gonna go to Chloe's tennis match at two today. I have been trying to arrange this meeting for the last three months. Who knows when I'll get another opportunity. There'll be other tennis matches. What's next? Your speech and victory on the Senate floor turned a lot of heads, including the Martins. They wanna have the family over for dinner tonight at their place about seven. They raised six figures for Congressman Gidell, and they don't even like him. This should get us closer to our financial goals. How's that sound? Sounds like we're gonna miss another family night. We'll be there. All right, I'll let them know you're coming. And I'll see you back at the office. Just trust me this one time. I really, really feel strongly about you not going to work today. Is that all you're worried about is another dream? It was more than a dream. It was like a vision, and it has something to do with some senators meeting with you at a hotel-- Well, there you go. Mitch just went over our itinerary. Don't have any meetings at a hotel. Nothin' to worry about. Just-- Please. Just do it for me then. We've been talking about going to see your mother, so let's go today. I can't. She's in a coma. What good would it do anyway? We'll talk about this tonight. She's leaving us. Get the defibrillator. What happened? She's stable. Get a technician to check out the equipment. Yes, ma'am. We'll let her rest. Be strong, faithful warrior. Your prayers are about to be answered. Chloe, come on, babe. We're late for school. Mitch, what is it? I didn't wanna say anything in front of Aubrey, but I ran into an old friend yesterday that works with Senator Rushton. Rushton wants blood. My friend shared confidential information on how Rushton and his friends took out Senator Gibson five years ago. The guy with the insurance scandal? Well, they found him innocent. Sure, but the scandal and other obstacles of their creation put a huge blemish on his political record. He never recovered. He lost his senate bid, lost everything. They're gonna start putting pressure on your financial backers to drop you while they look for skeletons in the closet. And when they don't find any, they're gonna make them up. So you're saying my political career is over. It's over as you know it. -You probably won't get a second term unless-- -Unless I compromise. They wanna meet with you at four. Stall them. Let me think about it. Okay, I'll see you. We're gonna have to calibrate the bombs on site. I'll show you how to do it. What's the matter? What if something goes wrong? We should send the data to the press now. We do not let go of our ace in the hand -until it's over. -Until it's over. Besides, we should be able to handle a few senators. You had German food last night. I thought you hated German food. -Katie loves it. -Here we go with this again. Things are different this time, okay? -Right, right. -Yeah. Third time's a charm. You guys are ridiculous, you know that? Testing, one, two, three. Are we good? We're all out of options. I've got a friend going over new research on your mother's condition. In all honesty, it doesn't look promising. -How much time does she have? -A week, at best. I'll keep you posted if her condition changes. Thanks. - I've been praying for you. - Please, Mom. But my prayers have been different. You don't believe, and I want that for you more than anything. I've heard it all before. I'm gonna be just fine. Are you? Jonah, I'm going home soon. What do you mean? I didn't wanna tell you unless I knew for sure, but the doctor says I have pancreatic cancer. How long do you have? Two, maybe... maybe four months. But I'm ready. Why do you still believe? Especially now. Because without God, life just doesn't make any sense. I don't know if you can hear me. Oh, I miss you. I need you now more than ever. Did you finish that Amherst report? No, I didn't, I'm sorry. I'll finish it this afternoon. Jackie, the meeting is this Thursday. I need time to prepare. All right. I won't let it happen again. Senator Richards on your right. Ah, speak of the devil. Meet you guys back at the office. Senator Richards. We were just talking about you. Senator, how are you? Good morning. This is my assistant, Jane Isner. Jane, this is-- The elusive Senator Jonah Thomas. I'm a huge fan. Really? How's that? You speak what's on your mind, shake things up a bit. It's a rare trait in DC. Well, you're too kind. How can I help you, Senator? I just need a minute. I'll let you two chat. I've gotta make a quick call. Look, I'm just askin' for one hour. -Well, I'm just sayin' no. -You're new around here. You could use some friends. And more importantly, you don't want some more enemies-- - Senator Rushton. - There's one for you. I know Rushton's trying to get over on ya, but if you come, that little meeting you're supposed to have at four, problem solved. So you'll handle Rushton if I come to your little meeting? Eleven o'clock. It'll be private. Senators McLuster and Williams will be joining us. All you have to do is hear us out. Williams? I know you two have been butting heads. Richards is putting pressure on Senator Thomas to back their cancer vaccine instead of yours. If he backs Richards' vaccine bill, Jonah will step right in the middle of your war with Richards. That's unfortunate. We need him on our side. What do you want me to do? Talk him out of it? He's a good guy. Someone should warn him. No, it's too late now. Look, let's just see how this thing plays out, all right? Maybe he won't join them. One hour is all I'm askin'. One hour. One hour, excellent. Look, I have got to run. Jane will brief you on the meeting. It's good to see you, Senator. He can be persistent. That's more like annoying. There you go, speaking your mind again. Well, the meeting is at 11 at the Artisan Grand. You know, if you'd like I can swing by and pick you up. Thanks, but I think I'm gonna go it alone. One never knows when a quick exit might be in order. Well, if you change your mind. Or if you ever wanna grab a cup of coffee, compare notes, give me a call. Gentlemen, let me remind you of something. These men are United States senators. That means this must go by the book. The hotel's been undergoing renovation so this floor is still sealed off. Does anybody have any questions? All right, let's lock it up tight. Your guy's not gonna budge from his convictions. You're too late. It's as good as done. Leave Senator Thomas alone. So where's my camera in the hallway? I'm on it. I'm sorry to cut this short. -I appreciate your time. -Thank you. -Been a pleasure. -Thank you. Hey guys, I'll be right with you, okay? Jonah. What did you do? What are you talking about? Rushton canceled the four o'clock. They're backing off. Well, hopefully it's nothin' I'm gonna regret. Don't go. There is another way. Hey! Wait. Why do I listen to your bad ideas? Ah, don't worry, he's not gonna show. It's a darn good idea, and yeah, he's gonna show. - Be sure of that. - We have a mystery guest. Life is short. Have a pastry. Don't worry, it was just a bad dream. Jonah, I am serious. Is there anything else? I'm gonna be late for an appointment. Chloe and I are spending some time together, and we'll be ready for dinner at six. All right, sounds good. Love you. All right, I love you too. You wanted to see me? You're not going to the wire tapper at the Artisan? Parker's heading it. He's the best. No need to get in the way. What's the real reason? Senator Baker. We've been watching him for almost three years, ever since the informant gave us a lead on him. He's close to his goal. Now Baker's office tips us off on pals he's in bed with? I find that a point of interest. What did you find? Stories from his staff aren't adding up. Phone records and correspondence verify my suspicions. So you think Baker's settin' up his old friends for a fall? I'm close to finding a motive. Okay. Keep on the trail. Keep me in the loop. He's got some powerful friends. Here we go. Zoom in, let's get an ID. That's Senator Thomas. Thanks for coming. We know how valuable your time is, so we'll try to be brief. Gentlemen, if you'll excuse us. -Thank you, sir. -You bet. You know Senators McLuster, Williams. Please. Two dollar tip. That's criminal. Hey Travis, why don't you take Katie out? All right, people, let's stay focused. Why the long faces? Thought we voted to raise our salaries this year. -This is a mistake. -Hey, take it easy. Sit down, Williams. Look, we know you're on the fence about the Blackburn Medical Reform Bill, and we need your support to move it forward, to get it passed. Well, what about Bennett? He's more inclined to go your way. Bennett couldn't convince a man dying of thirst to drink a cup of water. No. Besides, people trust you. You proved that yesterday. Washington's a pretty tough town. We play by a different set of rules and you're gonna need an ally to survive. Right now, we need you and we're willing to make you an offer. We can help you get your feet on solid ground. You're drowning in a sea of debt. We can save you. You're gonna have to do it. Hit send. That'll set the bombs. Gentlemen, thanks for your time but I'm gonna take my chances out there on my own. Whoa, whoa. I think we've, at least, earned the right to be heard here. What we're proposing is a win-win situation for everyone, including you. There's no harm in listening. All right, let's get going. We don't have much time. Dad? Dad, what's wrong? Get the phone. Rewind that. There's a camera on the wall that wasn't there before. Look straight ahead, walk. Stop. We got two gunmen in the hallway! Gilman, Travis, take 'em now! Freeze! -FBI! -Hands, hands where I can see 'em! - Wait. - FBI! Bring 'em around, bring 'em around. Put your hands behind your head. Hey, what's goin' on here? Hands behind your head, buddy. Right there, put 'em back. Put 'em back. Hands, hands where I can see 'em. On your knees! Get down. -What have you done? -I don't know. I didn't do anything. He's got somethin' in his hand. You see it? Down on three, two, one. [PORTAL WHOOSHES Peace. Be still. Am I dead? One could say that you never lived. -What? -No. You are not dead. We are in the spiritual realm of the world you know. There was an explosion that... How'd I get here? It took more than you can imagine to bring you here. We tried to warn you. Am I dreaming? No, this world is more real than the one you know. Well, who are you? I am Gabriel. The angel? And you thought I was just a myth. Once they form the barrier, we cannot escape. The enemy is in force. I do not know how much time we have as we are in the thick of a great battle. Battle, what battle? I am here to open your eyes to the truth. This battle... is for your soul. They are like hungry lions out to devour anyone they can. What are you talkin' about? They are the enemy, followers of the fallen star, Satan. Do not be deceived. They are superior in intelligence, clever, and can take on any form. Do you want to know the truth? Then take my hand. -Who are they? -Friends. I-- I can't move. We gotta go. Come on. I could be dead right now. Did you have anything to do with this? It was a wiretap. That's all-- You were wiretapping the room? When were you gonna fill me in on that? Look, let's get together. I can clear this up. None of those men deserved to die. Jane, listen to me. Jane. Jane? Breaching FBI database. This is the reckoning pool. It represents the words, thoughts, and actions of anyone that has ever lived, and lives today. Follow me. You can trust me. Is this really water? Yes. Look closely. Didn't I tell you not to play in the garage? I'm sorry, Dad, I didn't mean to. Please, I'm sorry. There was 200 dollars' worth of paint and supplies. Dad. You are absolutely worthless, you know that? Who's gonna pay for all this, you? Worthless. Each word and action, both good and bad, ripples throughout eternity. Your father never knew how his rage would affect your life and the lives of countless others, including his own. I could never please my father, no matter how hard I tried. But that's not true. Your father loved you very much. He even bragged about you to friends and loved ones. He just never knew how to show his love. I have revealed this to you so you can remember the pain of ill-chosen words. I vowed to never treat my daughter that way. But you have, even today. What? Today? Hold on. Well, what time? Two o'clock? Yeah, no problem. I don't have anything important scheduled at two. I can make that, no problem. He always lies to me, and he doesn't care about anything I do. I wish he were dead. You're okay. Come on, I got ya. I got ya, come on, let's go. I need a phone. Come on. Quiet. Gilman to Parker. -Yeah, Gilman, come in. -Travis is dead. In pursuit of suspects at north end of stairwell. Suspects are entering the 48th floor. Roger, Gilman, 48th floor. We copy. Okay, Mills is gonna cover the south stairwell. Do not pursue until he's in position. Acknowledge. Come on. This way. FBI Database accessed. I'm impressed. - How did you do this? - Do what? Firewall breached. Bobby, I'm getting a delayed transmission. Pull this up on your screen. I wanna trace the source on it. I want to show you something. I've seen enough. I notice how people gravitate towards you. You're a natural leader. Your mom and I have decided to send you to a special leadership training camp for a couple weeks. They don't take just anybody, but after talking to them they've decided to take you. Son, you have a wonderful gift. You need to learn how to use it. That was one of the best days of my life, one of the few times my father made me feel special. Those words and actions pushed your life in a positive direction. So all my words and actions are stored here? Everyone that has ever lived, who lives today. Nothing is hidden, and one day all things will be revealed. Time in your world is but a vapor in the eyes of eternity. Your kind chase after shadows, selfish ambition. It's meaningless in the eyes of God. There's been a huge explosion. We need immediate backup and medical assistance. Suspects are on the 48th floor. Agents Gilman and Mills in pursuit. Secure the floor and lock down the hotel. Backup is on the way. System security has been breached. Okay, hello. How did you get in? Give me that source. You got it? -Hey, buddy. -Hello, Colt. If you're watching-- if you're watching this, I'm probably dead. I just sent over the package with the data I've been collecting for the last couple months of the so called cancer vaccine. Just make sure the information gets out. It's important that people see this. All right, buddy. See ya some other time. Colt, what did you do? Dad. Dad! I can make it. -We have to go back. -Why? If we're still alive, they might still be alive. I wanna die knowing that I finished the job. Look closely. This morning, Senator Williams made his last adjustments to his financial portfolio. He accumulated more wealth than most people could ever imagine, some honestly, and some through ill-gotten gains. But he was very generous. But God knows the motives and actions of the heart. Williams, like many, hoped in the end that his good deeds would cover his sins and buy his way into heaven. Senator Richards took a different path to fulfill his desire for purpose, the lusts of the flesh. Straight. Sin has its season of pleasure, but there is always a price. Richards needed the deal to pay off the hush money for his many transgressions. Power was Senator McLuster's path. He wanted it over his constituents. He wanted power over his fellow senators. - I got that. - You got it? He wanted power over the nation. Like most, they never sought God for their true purpose. They missed out on the path that God prepared for them. Now they will stand before Him and give an account for their lives. McLuster's dead. I promise you, I'm gonna finish this. Where are the senators now? Are you sayin' they're dead? I will show you in due time. Do you recognize anyone? No, should I? Aren't you supposed to be a man of the people? Well, how can you expect me to know any of these people? Do you know your next door neighbor? Yeah. Clayton and Martha. Really? When's the last time you spoke with Clayton? If your son pleads guilty, the state has agreed to give him two years in jail plus rehab. He's only 19. We are paying you a ton of money because we heard you were the best, that you could get our son out of this mess, and now you're telling us you can't get him probation and rehab? He broke an officer's jaw during the arrest and he was in possession of a handgun. That changes everything. Two years is a gift, especially with this judge. Martha. You've been extremely hard on Jackie, even wondering how you could replace her with Jane, who you met just this morning. Jackie has been faithful to you. She does the work of two staff members even though you promised to lighten the load. Did you know that her husband left her and their son? Her dreams of love, shattered. She wonders how she's going to raise her son and pay the bills. Aubrey is wondering the same thing of you. She feels alone, as if you've already left her. She thought you were going to be there for her -as a husband... -I need some time to think. ...and a father. I know that Aubrey and Chloe are having a tough time right now. The first two years are the hardest on the Hill. What are you, judging me? Unfortunately, my responsibilities to help people take a lot of my time. I'm just trying to open your eyes to the truth. Your wife knew you were in a hurry so she took the liberty of ordering your favorite. Sorry, honey, I had to take a call. Good news, we can celebrate the passing of the Baker Medical Reform Bill in style. I've made reservations at our favorite place in Aspen. Are you okay? Where is Aubrey and Chloe? They're in Austin. Sorry I'm late. The traffic was heavy. - She's responsive? - It took a small miracle. She's weak, but she's... she's improving. She's not out of the woods but her vitals are improving. I'll give you some time alone. Try not to keep her up too long. Grandma! Hi. Oh, thank God you're back! Thank God. I'm happy to see my girls. Mom, I think Jonah's having a relapse from the explosion. The doctor said he may experience some forms of amnesia. Honey, you're gonna be fine. I'm gonna give the doctor a quick call. I'll just be a second. Uh... I am so glad you found Jane. Divorcing Aubrey was the right thing to do. She was just too demanding. This one is your true soul mate. I thought you loved Aubrey and were against divorce. Well, I've learned from recent experience that God wants us to be happy. He wants us to live life to the fullest. Jane and the Medical Reform Bill has allowed you to truly be happy. Jonah, it's the demon! Gabriel. Daegon. Yes, my prince. We need more reinforcements. Don't let Gabriel break our defenses again. Track them. What just happened? That was not your mother. It was Magog, a powerful demon among the enemy. They seemed so real. The enemy presented a lie that could one day be real. No. No, I would never leave my wife and daughter for her, or for anyone for that matter. You've already succumbed to the temptations in your heart. The truth can reveal the darkest parts of one's life, things you don't wanna believe about yourself. -So you can read my thoughts? -No. Our abilities are limited. However, God has no limits and He's allowed me a glimpse of your heart. All right, I might be tempted, but I would never leave my wife. Your confidence betrays you. The enemy will take you down a path that will leave your life in ruins and one step closer to accomplishing their mission. And what would that be? To destroy your marriage, your life, and as many lives as they can. No. I... I don't know how to explain it. I think that Jonah is in some kind of trouble. He is. May be concerned for their loved ones working at the hotel, but they are keeping us updated -on the situation. -He's there. Once again, police now believe that both explosions were deliberate and they have confirmed that there were people on the floors where the explosions occurred. - Oh no! We don't know if there are any injuries... It's my fault, isn't it? Oh no. I didn't mean to say that I wanted Dad to die. Honey, I know you didn't. And God knows you didn't mean it. ...all the streets within a mile of the hotel, and only authorized personnel are allowed near and in the building at this time-- I gotta go. Aubrey, Aubrey. It won't do any good. But this had something to do with my dream. There's gotta be a reason. God sent the dream to warn Jonah. The battle he's facing isn't against flesh and blood. I am not a part of your war. How do I know that you're not lying? 'Cause you still know in your heart that the path the enemy has presented to you would leave your life in misery. Love sees you as something beautiful, a prize worthy of dying for. Run! He's alive. Wha... What was that? Grena-- You all right? You still with us? I heard ever since that explosion you have trouble concentrating now and then. Would you like a drink? No. No, thank you. Well, you sure look like you could use one. That explosion was a terrible tragedy. I didn't know that you were in that little meeting there with Senator Richards. To be truthful, you got greedy. Started maneuvering behind my back. I had to make arrangements. You were behind the bombing? No, no, my plan was get the FBI to investigate 'em, expose him, get him out of office, get him outta my hair. But as fate would have it, those two lunatics... well, as they say, it's an ill wind that doesn't blow somebody some good. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Senator Richards was wise to bring you in on his little deal. People like you. You get things done. Nobody would have suspected a thing. I listened to those FBI wire tapes. You didn't have a chance to join them. But you can join me. My plan may seem a little bit radical in that it mandates certain advances, one being that the vaccine is clinically proven to eradicate cancer. Your mother has cancer, doesn't she? No more deaths from cancer. Not to mention the billions, and billions of dollars we would save the American public. My guess is you get a cut of each vaccine. If you help me, I will personally see to it that you move up in class. I'm talkin' about real power, real wealth. What do you want me to do? Nothin' that nobody else wouldn't do, or hasn't done, for that matter. Sounds like you want me to break the law. Just look the other way. All your problems will be behind you and the good life in front of you. Do you believe in God, senator? God? Look, our scientists have proven beyond a doubt that now in this day and age we have no need for a god. Now that's a fact. You can bank on that. But I do believe in positive energy bringing two people together, you and me here together today to do something for the good of mankind. Hm? You have a chance to be a hero in this brave new world. What is going on? I want some answers. They are searching for each weakness in your heart so they can tempt you into helping sign Baker's Medical Reform Bill, which will require the people to take the vaccine. The vaccine only appears to work for a few months and then the cancer will return with a vengeance, killing thousands, and millions upon millions of people will suffer a pain beyond human comprehension, a pain that cannot be stopped. If that's true, why didn't you tell me that earlier? It is my hope that one day you won't need me to tell you anything, that you'll be guided by the greatest of powers. What power? Let me show you. Hey Pam. Keep this within the agency. Don't talk to anyone on the outside without passing it by me first, is that clear? All right. Got somethin' you have to see. An old friend of mine, Colt Lesher, is behind the bombing. Actually, the best that we can determine is that Colt and his father, they ran into our agents in the lobby of the hotel. Forcing them to prematurely detonate the bomb using a cell phone, and at the same time sending me a ton of data. So what's in the data? Actually, some pretty damning evidence against the Blackburn Medical Reform Bill. The bill that Requires everyone to take a cancer vaccine. Known in the medical world as RZZ989. It's getting tons of buzz in the medical journals. Baker was on to them. Oh, he was more than on to them. Baker's been gearing up a cancer vaccine of his own. Richards' group is Baker's competition. Baker was using our wire tap to clear the playing field. But if the reaction is that painful, how is Colt's father even able to walk? Ex-Navy SEAL. Toughest guy I ever met. Each day, thousands and thousands of people from all over the world, from all races, from all walks of life, they were born into the bondage of sin which they cannot break free from on their own. They can neither see, nor feel their shackle because the Evil One has placed a veil over their eyes, blinding them from the truth, the truth that loves them and longs to set them free. There are many that have surrendered to the light of this world, the light of Jesus that leads you beyond the darkness that can open their eyes to the truth. A light that can free them from the shackles of sin and give them the gift of eternal life. God is about relationships. He wants us to walk in His light and know His love so that we can truly love Him and others. So what about those people who die without accepting His love? God sends 'em to hell? What kind of a love is that? But why would Colt and his father want to kill Richards and the other senators? And where did he get all that data? Short version, Colt's father has stage-4 bone cancer. Freid Pharmaceuticals creates RZZ. Colt's a big-time at Freid, so he finagles a sample of the vaccine for his dad and it lives up to the hype. He's cancer-free in three weeks. Four months later, the cancer came back. Colt hacked his way into the research department's database... discovered a major coverup by Senators Hear-No-Evil, See-No-Evil, and Speak-Plenty-Of-Evil. The vaccine slash drug, it works miracles in 95 percent of test groups. In the remaining 5 percent, the cancer growth slows but somehow their central nervous system comes completely under attack. Imagine third-degree burns all over your body with no sign of relief. It literally was driving patients insane. What else have you got? Apparently, our senators falsified the data. Millions of lives could be at risk. It is appointed for all to die once and then receive judgment. That includes you. Each person, great and small, will stand before God. Their words, thoughts, and deeds will be judged. Everyone whose name is not in the Book of Life will be cast into the lake of fire. Help us! Please! Help us! Do something! Why aren't you helping them? They've sealed their own fate. There's nothing we can do for them now. I can feel the pain, and agony. You were allowed to experience a mere fraction of their eternal torment. So this loving God created a hell? Why doesn't God do anything about the evil and the suffering in the world? If He truly cares, if He is a God of love he would've done something by now! He hasn't done anything! You were allowed to feel an ounce of Love's agony, rejection, and pain at the cross. Jesus paid the great price for the sins of this world, your sins, so that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but will have everlasting life. The question you should be asking yourself is... why would anyone reject the love of Jesus? Run! They're coming! Jonah, behind you! No! Jonah, my son. Mother? The best thing that we can do for Jonah is to pray. Dear heavenly Father, please protect Jonah. We know that he is in grave danger, but we also know that You are stronger than anything that he can face. Colt's father only has a month to live. That vaccine is brutal. Does Baker's vaccine even work? That's just it, we don't know. I mean, Colt was digging. How come Colt didn't come to you first, let us deal with it? According to the notes, Colt and his father thought the senators were just gonna get a slap on the wrist. They wanted revenge. It's the lap dog. There is no escape. Why are you so interested in this one? The question is, why do you bother with any of them? They're weak, unfaithful, so easy to deceive. And yet He favors them more than me, more than you. It is you that is unfaithful, and so easily deceived to believe that you and your master could defeat God. Love for them, that's His weakness. And that is why we will be victorious in the end. You can still join us, my brother. Still under the deception that you're going to win, liars believing the lie. If you change your mind, call out my name. Maybe I'll come and save you. Now I've got a war to win. Finish him. With pleasure. My son. You look so young. We are ageless in this world. Why are you troubled? I've seen so many things. I, too, have seen many wonders since I've been here. It's like my eyes have been opened for the first time. What do you mean? I was closed-minded before. I now know that hell was a myth created by a man to control men through fear. God is love. He forgives all. You're free to choose your own path at your own will. So you no longer believe in Jesus? I'm afraid that my time in this world is coming to an end. I can hear heaven's call. Let's experience heaven together. No. No. I saw the cross. Yet you still question, as you should. You don't believe. Leave him! Call upon Prince Magog's name and you will be spared. Last chance! Never! What's happening? They're creating a barrier. They're coming. What's this? Your sins. You're dying. They're here. I'll find you on the other side of the river. Oh, dear Lord... use this time to open up his eyes, to have him accept the gift of life through Jesus Christ, Your Son. No! You're worthless! You know you don't deserve mercy, and you're never gonna get it. You're a miserable father and a terrible husband! Your father's right. You're worthless. I know you don't love me. You always lie to me. I am here to open your eyes to the truth, the truth that will set you free. You were never there for me. I wish you were never born. Love sees you as something beautiful, a prize worthy of dying for. We deserve better. I hate you! Jesus paid the great price for the sins of this world, your sins. You know you don't deserve mercy and you're never gonna get it. Your father's right. You are worthless. God, please help me. I know I don't deserve Your love. Jesus. Forgive my sins. I give my life to You. Why did I wait so long? Come with me, child of the living God. My leg. Your leg will never recover in your world. But know that you are born again, and that you have new life. Chloe, get the doctor. No. It's gonna be okay. It's time. Not now. Grandma, please. Just don't lose faith, no matter how hard life gets. Tell Jonah my life is just about to begin. The angels rejoice over each sinner that repents. That's the fragrance of Jesus in you. You once had the stench of death but now you have the scent of life. I don't deserve any of this. God's love knows no boundaries. What do I do now? The Holy Spirit will guide you as you taste the goodness of God's word and walk in the light of Jesus. Sir. Sir. Can you hear me? Sir, can you hear me? We're gonna put you on the stretcher so try not to move. Does your neck hurt? Death is not the end, but a passage into the eternal. Oh! What is this? Well, you deserve it. Why don't you take the rest of the day off and have a nice long weekend with that son of yours. Thank you! Every desire, every motive ripples throughout eternity and will be judged in the light of the Righteous One. This world is fading, along with everything it craves. God's love reaches out to each heart to walk with Him and receive the gift of His salvation, rest, and peace. Yet many ignore His call. But for those who do the will of God, they will one day have every tear and every sorrow wiped away, and they will live forever in the glory and love of our Lord Jesus.
