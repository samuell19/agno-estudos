[announcer] We talk about David Beckham, Claudio Caniggia, Pele, world class players in the MLS at their peak. Well, it's time to add another player to that list because nobody's done more for the profile of US Soccer than Ryan Hawkes. [crowd chanting] HAWKES! HAWKES! HAWKES! [announcer] And now, what we are seeing is just dominating the possession for most of this half, and... We all know if you... [Danny] Go, go, go! Go! [announcer] But he's got to be able to get rid of the ball as well as finish, and you know what his choice is always gonna be. [announcer 2 indiscernible] [Lana] Danny, we have to get going. [Lana] Come on. Put your arm through here. Good boy. [Danny in Russian] Practice your English. Watch! Hawkes has got the ball. You want to watch the game or play in one? Huh? [Ruslan in Russian] [Lana in Russian] [Ruslan in Russian] [Hawkes] What are you watching, man? Give a card! Come on! Jeez. [Giorgio] Pass the ball Ryan. I was going for the tap in. [Hawkes] I'll tap in right now. [Danny] Yeah! [Lana] Score! Did you see that? [Lana] He got another goal. Good for him, and now we have to go get you one, hm? Record man yes! [announcer] He's now only three goals away from beating Wodolowsk and Wright-Phillips' shared record of 27 goals in a season. With the playoffs coming up, he's got to fancy his chances. [camera shutter snaps] [cellphone chimes] Danny... Why the sad face? Hm? You can't score in every game. [Lana] Not even your hero Hawkes can do that. Where's Papa? He had to work. He always has to work. But hey, I took so many photos of you! So he's gonna see what a little soccer star you are. [Lana] Come on, let's go. [Billy] This is gonna send you back to the laundry. [laughing] Yeah! Billy? Billy, my man! [Billy] Veinticinco! [both] Club record! I just got off the phone with Lang. Reminded him, this triggers another bonus clause. Ah, that's why I love you, baby. That's not the only good news. Really? [Hawkes] See you in the playoffs man! Hey Chuck, what's going on? Good game, man. [Giorgio] Hey Billy, we should chat sometime. [soccer player] Hey, what's going on? Good game, man. Arsenal called again. Yeah and? You like English food, don't you? I like wine country and the beach Billy. It's a good job I didn't tell them that. They want you big time. Yeah? Well, what's the offer? Well, it doesn't include a beach. They're talking about doubling what you make now, and that's without all the extra endorsements. [Hawkes] Come on Bangers and Mash it may be. Who loves you, baby? Hey! Oh, come on. I got you, I got you. Hey, come on here. Nice to see you, man. Thanks for coming out. Oh, I'll come back, I'll come back. Hey! Hello! This is he. Wait, what's that charity again? Yeah, yes I got your invitation. One second. Ryan? Yeah, what's up? [Billy] It's the Make-A-Wish Foundation. They want to confirm your attendance for Sunday. This Sunday? No, tell them I'll see them in the summer, okay? [Billy] Whoa, man, this is cold! I got to focus on the playoffs, man. I want that record, Billy. Tell them but um, I can't make it... I don't know, throw some money. Give them like a hundred grand. It's kids, right? Throw them two hundred grand, okay? [Billy] Ryan, one hundred's plenty. Two hundred Billy and It's gonna help with that whole Sportsman of the Year thing right? You know what I mean. You see it, you see it. You know what I'm saying. Hey, sorry about that. [Elise] Ryan! [Hawkes] Oh! Wait, wait, she's with me. She's with me. Come on. Hey baby, you made it! [Elise] You broke the world record? Oh, club record, baby. But, um, we'll get there. We're gonna get it, don't worry. [Elise] You better. Just don't forget your inspiration. [Hawkes] How could I? Oh that reminds me. Here, come on. All right. Listen up! It's been a good night, right? [crowd cheering] Been a good night, yeah! But it's gonna get a lot better right now. Elise Martin, will you marry me? Yes! There you go! Let me get that on. Let me get that on there. Oh, too heavy for you? I'm sorry, baby. Billy's getting jealous. I'll get back to you, all right? Stay pretty. Hey not bad! I hope you know what you're doing. Really? I'll tell Elise you said hi, huh? There goes [indiscernible] moron... moron! [rain pattering] Mom, let's go! [electronic dance music blaring] So this is the ring. [Man] Oh my god! -[woman] It's so beautiful! -[Elise] Isn't it amazing? [woman] So beautiful. [Elise] Yeah so he proposed just outside the stadium... so he went down on one knee... [Lana] You see? This one's almost done, and that one's still developing. -[Lana] It probably needs another minute. -[Danny] Yeah. [Lana] Just grab it right here and pick it up. Careful. Yep. [Lana] Look! You see? That's you! [Ruslan in Russian] [Ruslan] Daddy's home [Ruslan in Russian] [Danny in Russian] Danny, go do your homework. I don't have any homework. [Ruslan in Russian} [Lana in Russian] [motor revving] [Elise] Oh my god, baby, we have totally gone Kardashian. [Hawkes] Hmm? [Elise] Look, we are all over ESPN, TMZ, Twitter, look! No, baby, you're not looking properly! -[Elise] Come on. Pay Attention! -[Hawkes] I am looking. [Hawkes] Hang on, hang on. [Hawkes] All right. Wow, that's not bad! -[Elise and Hawkes scream] -[cars colliding] [Lana in Russian] [Ruslan in Russian] [heart rate monitor beeping] [doctor muffled speech] Elise! What's happened to my fianc√©? [doctor] She is fine Mr. Hawkes. She is at home, resting. [Billy] Welcome back! Hey Billy. You know something? Something's happening to my leg. What's this? Banged it up a little bit. Doctor here took good care of you. [Billy] Don't pull that. Little snafu with the law. [Billy] Me and the lawyers are gonna--stop pulling it! [Billy] A little community service, some don't drink and drive PSAs, a few bucks to AA. Everything's gonna be fine. Don't worry about it. [Hawkes] Playoffs? The World Cup, I'm not gonna make it. [Billy] Nonsense, Nonsense. You'll be back again playing before you know it. I gotta get that record Billy. [Billy] You're gonna get it. You're gonna get lots of records. You're also gonna get a DUI record. What'd you try to do, redesign the Pacific Coast Highway? [Billy] Who do you think xou are, Frank Lloyd Wright? What's the matter with you? Billy, I'm scared. [Billy] You're scared? You don't have to be scared. You're you. [Billy] Okay? -[Billy] I'll see you later. -[Hawkes] Thanks, Billy. I'm outside. You interrupted my pedicure, you know. [Hawkes laughs] -[Billy] Love you. -[Hawkes] Thanks Billy. [news anchor speaking Russian] [sighs] [Marina in Russian] [Lana in Russian] [Danny in Russian] Ah damn it! [Nurse] Now shift the weight. -[Nurse] That's it! -[Hawkes] Okay. That's good. You're doing great, Mr. Hawkes. Look at you! Really? -[cameras shuttering] -[Hawkes] I want to apologize to my fans. I... What I did, driving under the influence was both reckless and irresponsible. I would especially like to apologize to my teammates, as it appears that this injury means, I will not be able to play in the playoffs, or the Summer World Cup next year. [rain and thunder] [Lana in Russian] [man in Russian] [cellphone vibrates] [sighs] What is it, man? I hope you're not watching Fox Sports Center. [Billy] They're pulling your spots... But we'll get it all back. You just lay low. Do your community service... [Billy] Go to rehab. Once this is over, they'll be right back to kissing your ass. European style. Two cheeks. [Billy makes kissing noises] [dialtone buzzing] [sports anchor] There's a lot of teams that have friction. You know your star players have personalities and people are gonna bump heads. What we're worried about right now is his health, and maybe he could learn a lesson from all this. Guys look, Ryan Hawkes, one of the great players ever to play in Major League Soccer. however this is a guy who's behaving like a boy. Drunk driving? It's unacceptable. So as far as I'm concerned, Ryan Hawkes as a professional soccer player, he's done! Aargh! [woman in Russian] [Danny] How far away is Greece? It's actually not that far. Short flight south, near Mediterranean Sea. Are there pirates? [laughing] No, no pirates. You'll make good money? Mm-hmm... and I'll only be gone for six weeks. Six weeks?! [Lana in Russian] [Marina in Russian] [Zimmer] Excellence is a must, and our guests expect it. I demand it, and it is your job to deliver it. I assume most of you have never been on a ship like this before, so.... Pay very close attention. We have five sails, four diesel engines, three decks, two five-stars restaurants, one casino, and... absolutely zero exception in quality. Time to see the rooms. These are the ocean view suites, and this is your room. You have an hour to unpack, and after that, meet in the ballroom for further briefing. Hi I'm Sabine. I'm from Poland. Hi. Angela, Haiti. Do not touch my stuff. I'm Lana, I'm from St. Petersburg. [Amanda] Ooh! They gave you the job in the piano bar? Did you blow Zimmer or something? And this is Amanda. She's from New Jersey, in case you couldn't tell. Oh, this one is free. [Lana] Thank you. [upbeat music] There it is. There it is, that's my dress. [Friend] Oh my god, it's amazing! It's beautiful, huh? So we're thinking either Jay-Z or Kanye West for the wedding. We just can't decide which. [couple murmuring] [faint police siren] Are you drinking without me? [gags] Gross! All yours. So are you coming back inside or are you having too much fun sulking? I'm... I don't know if I could do this whole thing right now. What do you mean, this whole thing? I, I need some time. I've been gone a whole month. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you have. You have been gone a month. I need time for me, and not just, not with you, but none of this paparazzi... And you're telling me this tonight? At our engagement party? I'm sorry, but it's, driving me crazy! No-no-no, you do not get to be sorry! I did not tell the world we're getting married so you can go and have some pill-popping meltdown okay. Because you could've killed me in that car wreck, and I could've sued you for everything. But I didn't. I stuck by you, and now it's your turn. So man up! Because we are getting married this summer! Wow. You must really love me. Hey! Stop! Stop the car! Stop it! Where are you going? [Hawkes] You said summer, right? [Hawkes] Get me out of here! [Elise] No! [Elise screams] [camera shuttering] Give me that! [Paparazzi] Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. [Elise upset] Argh! [taxi driver] All right buddy. So what's up? Where we going? Hey look, this is the last time I'm gonna answer my phone Billy, so you know make it good. Ryan, where are you? Oh, you know Billy, someplace warm. So am I. It's called Hell! What are you thinking? You can't just leave. Ryan, we have major problems here. That DUI put you in breach of contract, you understand that? That means Lang's not obligated to pay you a dime while you're injured, and now he's even talking about canceling your contract altogether, and suing you! This is most definitely not the time to be taking a vacation! [Billy on phone] Hello? Hello? He hung up. [sighs] Don't stop. Oh my god, Lana. I snuck a picture of him going into his room. He is perfection! I would do things to him that are illegal in most countries. Girls, he's engaged! [Amanda clears throat] TMZ said they broke up, and she isn't here, but I am. If Zimmer even catches you flirting, you'll get fired. Zimmer's got to catch me first. I'm gonna harpoon that whale. Good evening. Uh... Lana? I'm Ryan. Nice to meet you. Ryan Hawkes? Oh, goddamnit. Was there like a memo or something? Actually, there was. Right. Um, What can I get you, sir? Umm, okay. First two things... don't call me sir, and uh second, um, dirty martini. Upside down. Coming right up. Very good. It's good. Very good. [piano player] Thanks. Goodnight Lana. -[Hawkes] Goodnight! -[Lana] Bye, Sam. Oh, we closed this place down. So, Lana, Lana. Talk to me. Um, I wanna know things. Where you from? You from Russia? St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg? Like Zenit St. Petersburg? That's cool. Pretty cool. Is that all you know about Russia? [Hawkes scoffs] No... There's Sputnik, and it snows all the time. There's giant um, bears everywhere. Yeah. I keep one as a pet. You know you don't. Um, I'm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't really wanna talk to me. Okay, Mr. Talker. So, what brings you to this cruise? Maybe I just uh, just came here to drown. Just know in case there is an accident, and the ship starts sinking, we are the ones who'll be manning the lifeboats. You will manage a lifeboat? The whole one? Mm-hmm. It's my job, to save people from drowning. Of course, except... I'm sorry. Is it me or is this ship spinning? I'm pretty sure it's you. And you should go to sleep. All right, fine. Because I like you, I'm gonna go, but I'm gonna... I'm, excuse me, I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you... Soon. Hm? It's a small ship, and this is the only bar. That's a good point. Yes. I will, um, I will see you soon. I'm just gonna... All right, I'll think about you. Oh, I'm sorry. We're closed. We're closed. [Hawkes] Bye Lana! So, what does a man worth 50 million dollars feel like? [Angela] Amazing, right? I bet he's hard as a rock. Hey! What? I meant his muscles. Anyway... Try no million. I read he lost all of his endorsements and his team is about to sue him. Girls, I made him drinks and I talked to him because I had to, but that's it. 'Cause that's you, Lana. Sensible, like a pair of nurse's sneakers. What am I even worried about? We all know that men like Ryan don't go for women like you. Don't listen to her. No, she's right. Girl... You are either blind or you seriously underestimate yourself. You're gorgeous. Thank you. Hey, it's my, um, it's my lifeguard! Come to save me. Too late. I really think you shouldn't drink anymore, Mr. Hawkes. Fine. Screw it. Thank you. Grandma said you were out earlier. Were you playing soccer? No. I play with Alina. Alina? [Lana] Who's Alina? Just a girl. You never used to like girls before. That was before. Before you grow up? Goodnight, mama. Sorry about before. Uh, painkillers and daiquiris are a terrible combo. That's all right. That and most women, when they meet me, are just a lot flirtier than that, no, like nicer. No, um, different... [Hawkes] To... to you. Oh, I'm not most women. And I'm definitely not your kind of woman. Well, I don't know if I'd say that. Yeah. All right. Good save, Ryan. Smooth. Oh, hey! Wanna take a break with me? You need to stop following me. I'll get in trouble. I am not following you. [chuckles] Oh my , I am following you. [Hawkes] All right, come on. I don't want you to get the wrong idea here. Mr. Zimmer Good evening, Mr. Hawkes. Ms. Kalinina, a word, please. This is unacceptable. Uh, excuse me. Um, she was actually helping me decide which drink I ordered. What was the one you suggested again? A dirty martini, upside down. That's the thing. See, I forgot the upside down part. Can I get one of those? Certainly, sir. You have to take Friday off. Did I do anything wrong? You cannot work four weeks without a day off. And goodnight to you, sir. Goodnight Thanks. Now, where is my martini? [Hawkes] Okay, new idea. Hear me out on this. What if we meet up off the boat? You're free now, so are there rules against meeting up on the island? [Lana] No, but that's not going to happen. Why not? Look, I mean, I'm telling you, Lana, I am a great tour guide. I can Google pretty much anything you need to know. And you? You, you can teach me Russian. You want to learn Russian? Yeah. I hear they have a very cheery outlook on life. [Lana laughs] Good night, Ryan. Wait, was that a yes? Okay, yes, but now be quiet, please! Whoa! Did you hear that? She said yes! She said yes, everybody! Hey, Ms. Kalinina, the ship leaves tomorrow at 10 o'clock so be on the boat no later then midnight. Thank you. [Lana] Hello [shopkeeper] Hello. [Lana] What do you have here? [shopkeeper] Oh, everything. I like this one. It's beautiful. [Lana] No, this would be perfect actually. [shopkeeper] Please go ahead. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Good morning there, my sweet surrender. Hi... Oh, relax. It'll be our little secret. You're gonna follow me all day, aren't you? Well, now that you mention it... [Lana] So, I was thinking about all those sorrows you say you like to drown yourself from. [Hawkes] We're not gonna talk about that now, are we? Well, I'm Russian. We don't do small talk. All right. You like the heavy stuff. Fine, okay. Well, after not making peace with the fact that my knee is shot and my endorsements have de-endorsed me and if I do get to play again, I won't be the player I once was. I guess what's there to worry about? My life is basically over. Ryan, but I believe when one door closes, others open. Just don't stare at the closed one for too long. You sure you're not some kind of undercover journalist? You're way too wise to be working on a boat. Anyway, it's uh, it's not really about seeing doors, it's honestly, it's about how people see me. Are you afraid that people are not gonna like you for who you are? Hell no. I know they won't. When you're in the spotlight, everybody wants to be your friend. But as I'm finding out, when that goes away, [whistles] goes everybody else. But now that you have time to do something else, you might make some real friends. If I'm, uh, perfectly honest, it's the something else that I'm most worried about. I don't know anything else. Lana, I wasn't always such an asshole, you know. I trained my whole life to be the best I can be, at one thing. All this other stuff kind of just came with the territory, I guess. It was a way... Lana, without soccer... I'm not really anything. I'm sure you have many more talents. There's a whole world out there waiting to be discovered. But to [indiscernible] you discover nothing without taking the first step. Hey! Hey! Oh, that's it. Now you're gonna get it! [Lana laughs] [yelling and laughing] [Lana] Let's check it out. [Hawkes] Hello, sir. [Lana] Hi. Who are you, like the local locksmith? Uh-huh... I'm not... [Hawkes] Oh, I... okay. Ah, I get it. The lock is the heart. You give it to someone, then... Throw away the key, making the lock permanent? That's beautiful. [Lana] It's very nice. -Oh, no, no. No, no thank you. -Oh. No, no. -[Lana] Thank you, sir. -[Hawkes] I think you might have the wrong idea. Thank you, thank you. Hey, kid, your ball. Your ball, kid. You are... Ryan Hawkes? Yes. Nice to meet you. Guys! It's Ryan Hawkes! I think we should probably go. No, no, no. You're going over there. Ryan, it's gonna make their year. Yeah, I don't know about that. Hey hey! [kid] Come play with us, man! Shut up, stupid. He can't play no more. Hey, I can play. Not full speed, but enough to teach you kids a thing or two. It's gonna make their year, right? Well, their month. Good enough. All right, let's do it. Come on, kids. Let's go, come on, guys. Let's play, let's play. Let's go, come on, run! [Hawkes] All right, go, go, go! [kids cheering and celebrating] Yeah, yeah! Oh man. I tell you one thing, it's not fixed yet. -[Hawkes] But uh, you're right. -[Lana] It's gonna be fine. You'll get there. [Hawkes laughs] [Lana] Sorry, no ice. No, you're a lifesaver. Thank you. Oh, so much better. Ryan, that's a great thing you did back there. Stop it. It was very cool. I'll tell you something, I haven't had that much fun playing since I don't know when. We should do more of that. Absolutely. Thank you for encouraging me. You probably get a lot better encouragement. What do you mean? Your fianc√©? Right. You look so good together. Yeah, don't we? Good for the magazines, good for the photos. Not so good for each other. Lana, I came out here because I was uncertain about us, but... things are becoming clearer. Um, you know, before I forget... Could you please sign one more autograph, please? Sure, of course. His name is Danny. All right, would you take pea duty, please? Thank you. He once had the tryout for Zensin St. Petersburg boys. -Really? -Yeah. But now just... Plays for fun. Ryan, you're his hero. Poor guy. [Hawkes] Ryan... Hawkes. Give that to Danny, and uh... How do you know him? Um... Actually, Danny is um... [man] Excuse me, sir. Can I have a photo with you? Sure. Yeah, absolutely. Cool. All right. Very nice. All right, Thanks, pal. All right, you have a good night. Sorry. Have dinner with me. I'm serious. There's this amazing place, it's like five stars. Best meal on the Med. I don't think it's a good idea. This isn't one of your silly ship rules, is it? No, Ryan. It's not against ship's rules, but it is against my rules. It's just a dinner. As friends. Girls, please help. I have a dinner Oh my god, with him? Look at me, what am I gonna do? Don't worry, baby. We got you. -Is it tonight? -Yes! I'm telling you, Lana. I think he's the lucky one. Wow. You look... Uh, um...Sorry. This is for you. Thank you, Ryan. Shall we? [Hawkes] Careful. Thanks. Oh, no, that can't be it. No, no, that-- Excuse me, excuse me, hey. -Excuse me. -Oh! [Hawkes] Hi. Uh... This place is meant to be five stars? It is. [Hawkes] It is. [Hawkes chuckles] I'm so sorry, Lana. This was meant to be nicer than the Four Seasons. We can go somewhere fancier if you want. Are you kidding me? Look. This is perfect, Ryan. What are your specials? Everything is special here, baby. See? [Hawkes] Great. Then two, please. This can't be more than two days old. Come on, Ryan. What? You sure you're okay with this? I love it. Oh hey, no, that's not fair. It's my turn now. Come on, hand it over. Come on. I'm trying to take pictures, not be in them, Ryan. Aw, that camera doesn't know what it's missing. Gosh. All right. Oh, whoa, whoa. Hide your plate. This might be its cousin. [laughing] You're right, you know. This place. It's perfect. Is it? You didn't get exactly what you wanted. But I got something even better. May I have this dance? This is Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky. All right. How do you say ocean? Okean. How do you say it? Okean. Okean. Okay, that's not so hard. [Hawkes] Stars. [Lana] Zvezdy. What? You have this ability to make me forget that I'm not [indiscernible]. And see only the good. Ryan! Ryan, wake up! We missed the boat! So we'll get the next one. I'm gonna get fired! Please. Like hell you are! I'll get you on that boat. Hey. Hey! Hey, got room for two more? [man] Yes, yes I do. Great! All right! [Zimmer clears throat] Ms. Kalinina. A word in my office, please. Mr. Zimmer, I'm so sorry I missed role call. I overslept. Not in your room, you didn't. Your identity card was never scanned back in last night. Your friends try to cover for you, but I know exactly... Where you were. Amanda told me that you absconded into the island with Mr. Hawkes. Highly inappropriate. Mr. Zimmer, it's not like that. Then I suppose his guest ID card was also never scanned back in last night. It's a pure coincidence. Fraternizing with the guests. It's an irreversible breach of contract. Mr. Zimmer, I need this job. Please! You should have thought about that beforehand. Pack your things. I want you off of the ship. Today. Fired, what? He can't do that. I'm gonna talk to the captain right now. No, Ryan, please. I'm embarrassed enough. What's this? The company has rescheduled to fly back home in a few days and they said I can stay there. Here? No, no, no, Lana, you are not staying at a place like this. I have an idea. Come with me. Please tell me he's the reason why she missed the boat. We really are fairy godmothers. [scoffs] [Amanda] What? Argh! Not too bad, huh? [Carles] Hey, amigo. [Hawkes in Spanish] How is the goal machine? The leg is looking strong. Ah, gracias. It's, it's getting there, man. It's getting there. Last time I saw you would've been that, uh... That charity match at Camp Nou. You know, I think you had me in your pocket the whole game. I didn't get a shot away. I remember, in my pocket. Oh, Carles, this is Lana. Lana, this is Carles Puyol. Barca legend. Pleasure to meet you, Lana. Nice to meet you. She's been stranded for a couple days so I'm just keeping her company. It's amazing here. I come every year. Yeah, I know. I do miss it here. You know what? I think I'll stay. You still have three days left on the ship. Eh, forget it. I'll send for my bags. I mean, what am I gonna do over there? All the cool people are here. -[Carles] Yes, they are. -[Vanesa] Hi, hi! Me and my wife, we'll be here all week. -Really? -Yeah We should grab dinner sometime. That's cool, yeah. Let's do it. I think that'd be a great idea. Ms. Kalinina, your room is ready. [Hawkes] That's you. Very nice to meet you. Thank you. [Lana screams] [laughing] Well, here we are. Well, I'm uh, right next door, so just let me know if you need anything. Ice, wine, sponge bath. Good night, Ryan. And thank you. For what? -For being a gentleman. -[sighs] [Carles and Hawkes in Spanish] Hi guys! What's going on? How are you? We got the money you sent. Thank you. How is the ship? It's great. I'm in Halkidiki right now but I'll be home in a few days. Halkidiki? Aren't you supposed to be in Mykonos? Yes, that's where the ship is. [Marina] Lana? Is everything okay? Everything's great. [Marina in Russian] [Danny in Russian] [Marina in Russian] [Marina in Russian] [Lana in Russian] Room service. You okay? Hm. Well, I have something that might cheer you up. I uh went back to the beach today and I uh... Realized I forgot something there. Surprise. -Ryan... -What? You know what you're saying by giving this to me right? Of course I do. But you're engaged. And my life is a mess. I took this trip alone for a reason. Elise and I are not meant to be together. No, this isn't right. What, what? -Normal people don't do this. -We're not normal, Lana. [Lana] You're not, but I am. We come from two completely different worlds. You gotta stop thinking like that. You are more amazing than any woman I have ever met. -I have to tell you something. -All right. Legally, I'm still married. Okay. I wanted to tell you earlier. Why didn't you? Because I know what this is for you. It's fun. It's recess. No, it's not. Now, I admit I was a confused man, when I stepped on that boat. But I stepped off it a better one. That's because of you, Lana. -Ryan, please don't do this to me. -Do what? You only know me for five days. Five days? I've played soccer for 20 years and in five days, you made me forget it even exists. We are meant to be together. Ryan, no. I realized, I got no way to get in touch with you. I don't have your email or your phone number. Ryan, what if we go back to our lives and you realize it wasn't meant to be? No, Lana, no. It was. It is. Then in two months, if you still feel the same, then come find me. What do you mean, two months, Lana? What are you talking about? We need that time to go back to our lives, to do what needs to be done. And then, if you still feel the same, then... Come find me in St. Petersburg. Alexander Column in Palace Square. May 25th at 8 p.m. Can't we just... email? No. If we're there, we're there. But if not, then... This would... Still be a great memory. Yeah. The Alexander Column, Palace Square, May 25th, 8 p.m. I'll be there. [Lana] That's for you. [sighs] [Lana in Russian] [Danny in Russian] [Lana] I missed you so much! [Danny] Mom, I can't breathe!

[exhales] I'm tempted not to believe it, but your results show, the soft tissue is fully healed and the prosthetics Is working as it should. Your range of motion, it's extraordinary considering it's only been a few months. So I'll be able to play again. Soon There's still a long way to go. But there's a chance, if you stick on your rehab schedule and... You listen to her. Yeah. Whatever it takes [Billy] So? [Lang] You. [Lang] What the hell were you thinking? You told me he was getting his head right. Now I see what you really mean. All right. Look, when I get back on that pitch, you are gonna beg me to stay. Prove it. Let's get out of here, Billy. You jealous? [laughs] Lang was right about one thing. If you wanna go to the World Cup, you can only prove your fitness by playing. You need Lang on your side for that to happen. For god's sakes why didn't you tell me about those pictures sooner? I couldn't done something that-- -I, I, Billy, I didn't-- -Could've contained the damage. I didn't know about the pictures, or that there was gonna be any damage. What's the point? Who cares, anyway? I mean, so I met some girl... Lang! Lang wants you focused. I want you focused. Oh, come on, now. You took a shot at one gold digger. Last thing you need right now is another. Hey, hey, hey. You have no idea what you're talking about. [Billy] Why are you doing that? Don't bother calling for a couple of days. I won't be reachable. Why? Where are you going now? Atlantis? The moon? Middle Earth? You just make sure you're back for your next session, or it won't just be Lang that's done with you. Yikes. [Hawkes] Hey. [Conciere] Welcome to Grand Hotel Europe, sir.

Uh... Um... [coach] Do you know age, position? [sigh] We try out... Hundreds of boys each year. We keep some information, but we are not KGB. [chuckles] Yeah. Danny's a very popular name, you see. Without that information, it's almost impossible. [Hawkes] May I? [Billy's voicemail] This is Billy. You know what to do. Hey, Billy, uh yeah, it's me. Look, I just want to apologize for, um, skipping out on you again. I'm in Russia, but don't worry, I'm gonna catch a plane back home. Vladislav Radimov? Hey.

I said, it would probably make their year. [chuckles] [Hawkes indiscernible] Nice place you got here. You spend much time in St. Petersburg, Mr. Hawkes? Oh, just a couple of days. I was hoping to spend more time, but it looks like I'm gonna be heading home. [nurse in Russian] My colleague tells me that we have a big fan of yours in a neighboring ward.

Um, sorry, I better get going, but uh... You rest up, get back playing again, and these guys are gonna get your details. See you in LA, all right? Oh, hey, you uh, want me to sign your ball before I go? Yeah! Awesome. All right. Okay, so... Where'd you get this? My mom brought it. She said she met you on a ship. Your mom? What's your mom's name? Lana. And you're Danny? How did you know? Hey, tell me something. Where's your mom now? Wait, you know her? I've been looking for her, yeah. Probably my whole life. Okay... She left a while ago. So she's probably crossing the bridge, if she didn't get to the Metro... Okay, okay... Look after that. Wait, Ryan. Where are you going? I'll be right back.

[guard in Russian] Lana! LANA! Lana! Lana! How... how'd you find me? Danny helped. Danny? [announcer] Ryan Hawkes, a literal walking miracle, folks, is taking the field for Team USA for the first time since his career-threatening injury. [color commentator] Twenty-five goals last season, I'm sure Hawkes will be satisfied just to play 25 minutes of this World Cup, and who knows if his leg will hold out? [announcer 2] Hawkes still has a lot to prove after that leg break. And until he starts scoring again, the jury's out. Come on, Ryan! Go, go, go! [Giorgio] Do it! [crowd chanting] HAWKES! HAWKES! HAWKES!
