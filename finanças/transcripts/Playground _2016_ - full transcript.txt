"We gotta talk, remember?" - What time will you be back? - At two. - Need help? - Nope. - Call me if you need me. - Okay. Hi. Dad, will you turn it down? - Bathroom time. Get up. - Right. Hold on. Gosh, you're heavy. Unlock, will you? Where's mom? Dunno. Still at work, I guess. Put the cover up. Hold on. And up we go. Not like this! It hurts. How should I hold you then? I don't want to break any bones. Wait a sec. Wipe yourself right. A new bedsore? Gotta lubricate it. Not to worry. - Wanna change the T-shirt? - No, later. Move the chair closer... Will you help me a little? Oh my God... - When is Miss Basia coming? - At one. - What will you drink? - Water. - How many sandwiches? - Two is enough. - Cheese or ham? - Cheese, plea-- Want a tomato or a cucumber? No, ketchup please. Got enough money for some pretty flowers? Yup. Good. How much ketchup? A little. I'll give you a lot. - Well? - Spread it. - You want me to spread it? - Yeah. - Have you eaten? - I have. - You can have this one. - No. My pills, please. Eat first. - What are your plans for today? - I'm off to a rock concert. Cool. Good luck. - I'll hop into the tub. - Don't drown. No chance. Szymek! Szymek! Done? Unlock it. "Mom" Two, please. - Can you add a ribbon? - Sure. - Burn the bastard's head! - Right on! It's getting away. - There! - Like this! All right, it's gone. Enough. Get up for a pic. Closer. A nice hug, you fairies. All right. - Raise your hand. You, the leg. - Me? Yeah, you. Put your leg up. Szymek! Come here. What? What? Wanna go here? See that? Look. What's that? I don't want him in my room. - Why not? - Cause I can't sleep. You'll sleep it off over the summer. I won't, cause he'll scream and I'll have to get up. Put on your headphones. To sleep? - Turn on some music. - I can't sleep with the music on. So where should I put him? In the hallway, for example. How about moving you into the corridor? Would you like that? Fancy sleeping in the corridor? You're both kids, but you're older. So you'll be just fine in the corridor. You used to scream as well. You think you were special? Don't whine and do your stuff. Eat, shower, brush that mop on your head. Shirt is nearly ready. - What time does the school start? - At 9. And the flower money? Get it from Pawel. Mom says you gotta give me cash for the flowers for my teachers. I ain't gotta do shit. Say please. Please, give me the flower money. That's better. How much? 50. 50? Are you kidding me? - One flower for every teacher. - Here's 50. I'm kidding. Are you fucking nuts? Here's 10. Ha-ha, funny. That's all? You're fucked in the head, if you think that's enough. Wanna be fucked in the ass? - Get out. - No. What about my graduation gift? - What gift? - A video game. I'll get it for you when I have enough money. - When will you have it? - When I get my paycheck. Will you help me cut my hairs? Hair! Can you hear a fucking S there? - Yeah. - Where? H-A-I-R-S. HAIR, for fuck's sake. Dude, you're old enough to cut your own hair. Do it, I'll come and check. - Gimme a smoke? - Want a poke? No. - Did Pawel give you money? - Nope. Why not? You were supposed to get it from him. What did you tell him? On your way to school you'll collect the meat from the butcher's. - No. - Yes. - I won't. - You will. - Fu-- No way. - You have to. You must be fucked in the head if you think I'll go there. You will or we won't have dinner. - You go then. - I'm going to the doctor's. I don't give a damn. Will you stop fooling around? - I am serious. - Do as you're told. No. You're getting weird. Don't squeeze it so hard or you'll get buffed up. - Maybe I want to? - I can see that. - How can you tell? - You're squeezing it like crazy. Maybe I want to? Maybe it's you I'm molding? Then stop. I ain't no looker anyway. - I'll have a voodoo doll. - Of your own mother? Yup. - Is that so? - Uh-huh. - Like a little kid. - Exactly. Stupidest idea ever. Then stop nagging me about my ball. - Good morning. - Morning. - Is Bartek here? - In the toilet. I came for the meat. - Good morning. - Yo. What happened to your head? It's for graduation. You look like a fucking Auschwitz victim. Hold this. Don't pack too much, I have to go to-- to school now. Here. - Thanks. - Anytime. Come. Here. Help yourself. - Me? - Put your leg up. Szymek! You fucking baldy. - No flowers? - Nope. - I forgot. - Want one of mine? - Three puffs each. - Right. Three. SCHOOL This ball is shit. Just soften it, and it will stick. Stop running! The hall is not for running. It's for walking. Go on. I threw it so hard, but was almost silent. We can go to the mall later to check out new games... Okay. - You can barely hear it, huh? - Yeah. They run back and forth, back and forth. Whatever. Let's play. It's pissing me off. Here. Start with: "Hi, how is it going?" Then five minutes of chit-chat, and then you can tell him you like him and ask him, if there is a chance for you to date him. - In what tone of voice? - A normal one. Like mine now. But unbutton your shirt. Anything from 2 to 3 buttons down. And get rid of the fucking ribbon, unless you wanna pass for a 5-year-old retard. Show him your knee, swing your pony tail, move it to your shoulder. He will show up, so don't worry. He'll have no choice. And always look into his eyes. Don't gaze sideways. Anything else you wanna know? No. I guess... Do boys like me? Bartek said you're hot and he'd date you. So did Shorty. But just ignore them, you're after Szymek, right? Anything else? - Smaller value notes? - Whatever. Here. And this. What is it? What...? What is this? Don't you know? I think she doesn't like me... Zuzia, do you like Czarek? Yeah. - Damn nice! - And he got all red in the face! He's jealous. You're all sweaty, bitch. - She admitted it so openly. - I wouldn't... - She was like "yeah"... - Yeah. Szymek... - Don't be jealous. - Come here! She's so aggressive! Be safe! You think you're a cutie? - Aren't I? - No. From Gabrysia. Do what she asks you to, or else your naked butt will go online. Clear? - You're the postman? - Beat it. - Go brush your teeth. - Fuck you! - Shut up. - You shut up. He got a little note. A love letter! Good morning, class. Go to your seats. Quickly, please. Chop-chop. In a moment, we'll go downstairs for the end-of-year celebration. You will sit in rows 2, 3 and 4. Do try do behave. Our principal will hand out report cards, diplomas and prizes. Afterwards you're all coming back to the classroom - and we will all say our goodbyes. - What is it? - What did she write you? - Fuck off! - Read it! - Shut the hell up! Czarek... You're disturbing us. Do be quiet, I don't want to forget anything. Ready? Leave the flowers you won't be needing downstairs. Okay guys, we may... - Szymek, do you have the camera? - I do! Please stand up. Get in pairs. Leave the chocolates! Marta, Oliwia get in front... Are you fucking nuts? - Fucker. - I'm telling the teacher. We'll see. ...silver-colored little pebble from the mountain top and a sandy little seashell all remind us of: golden sunshine, golden sands, shining silv'ry sea, greenest meadows, greenest forests, flowers on a tree, hills and mountains that are rising to the clouds up high, skies of blue and golden flames of the bonfire night. Thank you for the summer song, Lena. Dear children, some of you won't be returning here after the summer break. You'll go to different schools. Some of you will never see each other again. Well... I want you to represent this school with pride. I, your principal, wish to bid you farewell, and inspire you with the words spoken once by a great leader saying goodbye to his son: "Wisdom is the greatest wealth of the Earth. Stupidity is the greatest misery. Be ashamed if you fall into self-admiration. Be proud if they say you have a strong character. Do not seek friends among fools, as they will bring you more harm than gain. And beware of liars... as they are like mirages. They convince you that what is distant is close to you, while distancing you from what is truly close." And now... time to award the most talented students of our school... who excelled in extracurricular activities: The winner of the 1st prize in the Polish Language Competition, Gabrysia Wolska, class 6A. Keep up the good work. Congratulations and thank you. - Thank you. - Well done. Let us continue. The winner of the Recycling Competition... our outstanding pupil, Bozena Siejk, class 6B. Come up here. My dear children, the so-called official part is over. From the very bottom of my heart I wish you all a relaxing, safe and warm summer. You are all very special. You have great opportunities, so try to make full use of them. Hold this. How about a smoke? Let's get inside. Get off my foot. Check this out. What do you need Fatty's pics for? I took pics of everyone. It'll be embarrassing when she follows us around. I know. Weird. Why do you want me to go there? - Tell him to go away. - It's a free country. - So what's up? - I want to show you something. - Just show it to me here. - No, I can't. All right. I'll be there in half an hour. RUINS "Mom" Hello? Hi there. We're still hanging out, me and the girls. Not yet. They're here, but I walked away from them. Yeah, a book. "The Greatest Old Towns". Fatty must have done something. I think she bribed her. They're friends all of a sudden? - These pics are so embarrassing. - I told you. We're here. Fuck you. So what? Stay here. Shh. I see her. - I'll go with you. - Stay here. Fuck you. No. So sit over there. But shut up. Gimme a smoke. And the lighter? Get your own already. Remember to give it back. Okay, I'm going in there. I wanted you to come, because we need to talk. So talk. The thing is... It's been a few months... I sort of... fell in love with you. I like you a lot. And, uh... Is there a chance we could... you know... date? Honestly, I don't think so. Why did I come here? Because I wanted to tell you this. You could've told me at school. Not really. Anything else? What the fuck are you doing? You're too warm? Are you fucking stupid? - What the fuck? - Here. Take it. Are you fucked in the head? What are you doing? You wanna get laid? You got the wrong guy, for fuck's sake. What a dumb bitch. Wanna hear something? Something important? Look at me. Dude! Get over here! Hurry up, man! What? You're not leaving. No fucking way. What? Wanna get laid? If he doesn't want to, I'll do it. You wanted to get laid, he's willing. - Come on! - Undress. - Do it! - For me, do it! Polish porn, fuck me! Don't record this. Come on. Stop it. What? What now? What now, bitch? What? What will you do now, you moron? - I'll grab you. - Let go! Show us your fat tits. - Come on! - Show them! Take this off! Leave me alone. Show us what you got! - Don't be shy! - Show us some skin! - Come on! - Stop! Why are you unbuttoning that? - Fuck her! - Stop recording! Do it with me! - Show them! - Get off me! - Now! - He'll fuck you. What? You're crying? Show us your tits! Dumb whore! You're fucked! Eat it, you slut! Here! Eat it! You fucking skank! Wanna bite? - You'll choke on it! - Stop it! Cry now! You dumb slut! Fucking retard. Are you fucking normal? Teach her! You want this? Fetch! Shit... She's crying! Aww... What now, you dumbass? Wanna say something? Shit. What? Up with that, right? Take your clothes off. - What are you doing? - I ain't doing shit. What would you like me to do? Say it! What do you want? Shit, spill it out! Get your fat ass out of here! Yeah! Fucking cry now. Cry! - Don't shit yourself! - Psycho! Pathology case! To be honest, I don't even know her name. To be honest, I think it's Fatty. Wait, wait... What the fuck am I waiting for? Look at her hitting me. Where are her tits? And why is it so shaky? In case you didn't notice, she went and started hitting the phone. With her fucking gorilla hands. Fuck. All right, let's go to Kom Net. It's being renovated. Okay, whatever. Want some jelly candy? Miss...? - Get the "rat". They're good. - You've got rats at home. These are awesome. Ever tried the green ones? Lemme finish this one. Super sour. Eat it whole, at once. - Sour, huh? - Yeah. - I won, I ate the whole fucking thing. - All right, piss off. And Jack says: "Not so fast, the construction has just started." Funny, huh? - Am I laughing? - Yeah, like crazy. What a lame joke. Ha-ha, very funny. See... Fuck! Michael Jackson... A model on a catwalk. And a pose. - I don't need to carry the ball. - Leave it there! Polish it up. I kindly ask you to leave the escalator and just do your shopping. Thank you. - Stinks like meatballs here. - You stink like meatballs. Nah. I don't think so. PLAYGROUND PLAYGROUND
