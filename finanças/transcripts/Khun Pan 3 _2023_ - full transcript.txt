This film is inspired by a true story Characters and incidents portrayed herewith are fictitious. At the end of World War II... Bangkok, 1950 the country fell into crisis. To avoid being punished for collaborating with Japan the Thai government signed an agreement to pay war reparations with 1.5 million tons of rice to Allied Powers. So the Big Brothers would take us under their wings. The deal soon bankrupted the state. Food became scarce and expensive. The military, the police and feudal landowners took turns taking control of Parliament. It was a time of crippling inequality and dark intrigue. Scores of intellectuals and influential figures were assassinated by bandits who became politicians' hired guns. Who could serve crooks better than other crooks? These are title deeds that farmers have put up as guarantee. Now I want you... to get more men to guard our opium houses before the bandits raid them again. Otherwise, we will stop funding you lads. You're overreacting. Do you think the Blackshirts would dare mess with the opium cartel? Bandit Dam has sent us a threat. Bandit Dam His intention is clear. Help! I don't want to die! Help! Help! Help! Help! No! Help! Help! (Chanting) Bandit Dam. Take everything you want! Please don't kill me! Your time's up, Boss. Sir to prove that your allegiance doesn't lie with the Blackshirts and that you do not sympathise with those outlaws I request that you truthfully answer my questions so this evaluation will fully benefit yourself and the police force. Yes, ma'am. There are ample reports of your use of excessive violence. I did my duty. Please answer the question. I killed them... to uphold the law. Is this what you call upholding the law? We found 21 bullets in the skull of a dead bandit. They all came from the same gun. Your gun. There's something else we don't understand. You always cut off a tuft of hair or removed some teeth from your victims. Why did you do that? That's how I communicate with them. Khun Pan is a relic from the bygone era. As a human rights activist I think you've crossed the line. We should make an example out of him. If they are ghosts... I'll be the Lord of Death. Surrender and I'll let you live! There are bombs on the ground! Watch out! Sir, we've lost almost all of our men. What now? (Chanting incantation) Get me a torch. If they don't come out I'll burn them. Go! Khun Pan 3: Judgement Day Sir, please give a statement. What's the verdict of the rights commission? Do you think your action was excessive? A question here, sir. In 1950 Lt. Gen. Khun Pan was cleared from the charge of conspiring with Blackshirt bandits. He requested to be transferred back to his hometown. Amidst the ongoing political turmoil he gave up his weapon whilst the country strove to seek a way out. Politics heats up. Three opposition MPS kidnapped no bodies found. Nakhon Si Thammarat The tobacco is ruining your gums. It'll get worse. You should quit. You grumble just like my wife, Doc. Hey, the bearded ogre! Number One. Khun Pan. Vote for number one. Thank you. Thank you. Hey! Hey! Is Noon's blouse ready? Yes. Here you go, sir. Thanks. Thank you. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - How are you? - I'm fine, thanks. Bless me with lots of customers, Dad. So I can lavish you with offerings. Oh. Good morning, Khun Pan. Hello, young man. No, don't touch that! Not that one. Come here. - This one? - This is the latest model. - The latest model? - Coming through! Stop. Noon, come and take a look. I'm buying you a transistor radio. - Slowly. - Yes. Thank you. Come and take a look. This one. Please vote for number one. Khun Pan. - This is the latest model. - Thank you. We'll turn on the music every day so our baby will be in a good mood. It's a boy. Really? Really? Are we having a baby boy? Yes! I'm going to have a son! Yeah! This calls for a celebration! Folks! Khun Pan is going to have a son! Khun Pan is going to have a son! Thai Sky Publishing Sorn, the editor's looking for you. Got it, Fah. Hi, Sorn. Editor There you are, you son of a gun! Sit. For your eyes only. First Draft - The Sorcerer Lawman Sorn stop writing about Khun Pan. It's old news. Write about Bandit Mahesuan and Bandit Dam. Last time you wrote that they'd rob a bank. And they did rob a bank. People loved it. Let me write three more stories about Khun Pan then I'll start working on Dam and Mahesuan. Look, I think you should put fantastical elements into it. Black magic, sorcery and crazy gunfights, you know. People dig that stuff. But the critics will slag us off for peddling superstitions. Critics be damned! Trust me. Start writing about Bandit Mahesuan and Bandit Dam now. I want to publish it before their next robbery. Got it? Yes, Boss. Wanted! Bandit Mahesuan Reward 1,500 Baht Sirinkorn Bank Here, miss. These two bandits are currently wreaking havoc. Please be careful. All done. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Mahesuan is here to rob you! There he is! Hold your fire! He has hostages. Catch him alive. Stop him! Stop! Yes, sir. Mahesuan just disappeared. We are searching the perimeter. I'm from the central bank. The manager here called us to report a threatening letter from Mahesuan stating Mahesuan will rob the bank tomorrow at noon. I'm on the security team that came to take items in the safe to our command centre. Too bad he got to them first. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Sirinkorn Bank Butr, hang in there. A life for a life. Noon, are you all right? What's wrong? It's fine. - Who's that? - Stay. Stay here, I'll go check. Butr! His Venerable is about to cross over. He wants to see you. Butr... Do you still have the spell of invulnerability? Yes, Venerable. You have it now, but not forever. Nothing is permanent. Everything fades at its own time. Just like me at this moment. My time has come. Come closer. That demon you saw is your past karma. It's the spirits of all the men you've killed. They've returned to take revenge on you and your family waiting to attack whenever you become weak. A life for a life. Sir... is there a way for me to escape from my past karma? Everything fades and dies. A cycle cannot be interrupted. Use what I taught you to protect people until your final moment. Then let go of yourself and everything around you. When there's no self there's no need for any protective spell. Remember this. The newborn will save your life. His Venerable had already departed before you arrived. Butr, you should seek refuge in monkhood. It will relieve you from your past karma. The demon... it wants your life. Sir... please don't tell my wife about this. The opposition is gearing up for the censure debate. People fear that the government may dissolve parliament before any scrutiny can take place. A general election will surely heat up Thai politics. Mathuros Restaurant They're using all sorts of dirty tactics. Many on our side have been taken out. Kawin Mala Those who live are constantly under threat from the mob. People are starving... Dr Thana Thong-Inn but they're still obsessed with power. It's important that we end this now. Tiang Khansiri Do it while we still have some support left. We're going to have an election soon I don't want to see people dying on the street again. We have to fight them in the election. A victory from people's votes is much more dignified. You mean an election rigged by them? You said we'd win. Have you forgotten about phantom votes? They'll rotate voters. They'll put fake ballots into the boxes. We'll never win because it's their rule. We should wait for a signal from Sa-nguan once he returns from China. But it's very dangerous. How can Sa-nguan sneak back? Kawin. Protect the MPs! Run! Let me cut to the chase, Khun Pan. Sa-nguan Nonethai. Kawin Mala. Dr. Thana Thong-inn. And Tiang Khansiri. They are influential left-wing politicians from the Northeast. Three of them were kidnapped from a restaurant in Bangkok. Except Sa-nguan Nonethai. He's on his way back from China. Sa-nguan will be ordained in Chiang Rai before returning to Bangkok. Captain Tatthep's men will escort him all the way. I'm sorry, Lord Dej Jamras. But I no longer serve the central bureau. I know. I authorised your transfer myself. But I truly believe that only you can help us. Wanted! Bandit Dam - Reward 1,500 Baht We believe the kidnapping was the work of the Blackshirts. Those outlaws are still causing trouble even after the death of Bandit Fai. They run rampant and now they've kidnapped these three men. You're the only person who knows their ins and outs. Honestly, sir, I'm so honored to have a chance... to work with a living legend like you. Your experience will contribute a great deal to the mission we're undertaking. The Blackshirts pretend to help the poor by robbing the rich but, in fact, they're just criminals. It's about time we ended this, Khun Pan. Look... Noon... if you don't want me to I won't take the job. Don't worry about me and our baby. Just come back in time for our son's birth. I promise, son. Phichit Province Tickets, please. Sa-nguan Nonethai Listen, we've entered their territory. Stay vigilant, everyone. - You heard me? - Yes, sir! A glass of whisky, please. Sawitree Nice name. Don't you feel lonely travelling by yourself? Don't move! This is a robbery! Get down! Sorry. - What are you doing? - You have a gun? Sit down! Sit! Don't play smart with me. Give me the microphone. Hey! Turn around! Hands up! Attention, please. I have bad news. The train is being robbed. Don't move. But do not be alarmed. Don't move! We're not going to hurt you. We just want Mr Sa-nguan Nonethai. Don't do anything to risk the lives of the innocent. Do not force us to use violence. Order the train to stop and bring Mr Sa-nguan to the dining car and no one will be harmed. Hey, miss! What are you doing there? Get up! Get up now! - Go back! - A bomb! Please help me. He forced me. No! Turn around! Fuck. Bandits, attack! Hi there, Khun Pan! I'm Bandit Dam. You and I have a score to settle! (Chanting incantation) Back up! Get down! Now! Get down! Doc, are you alright? I'm fine. Go get Mr Sa-nguan. They tricked us! Look at me. Open your eyes and look at me! Dam, we have to go! They duped us. Sa-nguan is dead! - Wake up and look me in the eyes. - Dam! - Dam, enough! It's a trap! - Khun Pan! We have to move! They're going to kill us all! Look! Bandits! Fall back! You're lucky the bullets didn't hit any vital organs. But I'm surprised bullets could finally pierce your skin. I heard that he removed hair or teeth from every crook he killed and kept them in his gun box. Why did he do that? To lock up their spirits so that they won't come back to harass him. Are you alright? Don't worry, sir. I'll find out where they're hiding. These police officers were tracking down the Blackshirts' hideout. I'm sure the bandits got them. Where did you find these bodies? They floated down the river, sir. Phetchabun Province Gather here, all spirits. God Indra has given you the rights to become ghosts. Ghosts, rise. I have questions for you. (Chanting incantation) Show yourselves. Tell me where your bodies came from. These markers show the villages where the bandits hand out their money. The area is protected by mountains. The only way in is through this treacherous river dangerous and strewn with rapids. Deputy Chief of Defence Staff The locals call it "Corpse Ravine". Anyone who went in never came back out. The villagers believe the area is infested with vicious ghosts. But I'm quite certain this is the entrance to the bandits' hideout. Arm your men to the teeth. You have a tough battle up ahead. Headquarters have decided to exterminate all these outlaws. I can't do that, sir. Stop playing the hero. Don't forget that you were suspected of siding with them before. It's true I was once embedded with the Blackshirts. So I know that most of the bandits are just poor farmers who're forced to rob because they're starving. They weren't born outlaws. Poverty cannot justify lawless behaviour. Your "poor farmers" are in fact anti-government malcontents. And remember you're not the one calling the shot here. Understood? Go! Harder! - Captain! - Keep going! Careful! - Paddle, everyone! - Go! - Paddle, everyone! - Go! - Paddle up! - Careful! Captain! - Help the Captain! - Captain! Grab it! Pull! Is everyone alright? And the equipment? Sir. Sir. Sarge. There they are. Hey! Only one boat. The villagers must be scared. Thank you for saving me. You're welcome. Get your men ready to tow the boat. Corpse Ravine That skipper is so scared he has bolted. We must be close now, sir. Watch out! Come here! Quickly! Yes, sir. Come on! Sarge. - Captain. - Go. Keep going. Don't let your guard down. We're in their den now. Sarge. Sir! Sarge! Bandits, attack! You think no bullets can harm you? (Chanting incantation) (Chanting incantation) Hey! Don't stick your nose into my affairs! If you kill him they'll send more men to get us. Besides, he's in my zone now. It's my call. Mahesuan, you're asking for trouble. Don't ever look away... or he's fucking dead. Doc. Look! Go! Shoot it! Shoot it! I'm out of here! I'll shoot you dead if you run! Die! - Keep taking the temperature. - Okay. Let me see. Take a deep breath. - Has this one gotten the pills? - Not yet. Lie still. - Dr. Karn. - Dr. Sa. You have to talk to Mahesuan. We have too many malaria cases. And not enough quinine. Worst case our patients may have to draw lots. And we'll end up with more dead bodies. I'll talk to him. - Okay. - Doctor, help! He was shot. Doctor, help. Nim, check his wound. You didn't sustain any serious injuries. Look, no need to get nervous around here. Mahesuan has instructed everyone in his zone not to touch you. But watch out for Bandit Dam's minions. I wager with all of this. If my men can catch you the Whiteshirts have to pay me five times more. And Jerd, you have to stay away from my daughter Chaba. You clowns! What's with your stupid laugh? What's so funny? So, what do you say, Jerd? Deal. But if you can't catch him you have to give Chaba to him. Jerd don't embarrass me. Be careful! - Jerd! - Father. Let me go! Catch him! Be careful! Go, Jerd, go! - Catch him! - Be careful, Jerd! Take it all! Hurry up! What will be your wager? If I catch you you'll have to answer all my questions. My pleasure, old man. Mahesuan! Mahesuan! Mahesuan! Mahesuan! Mahesuan! Lots of wild beasts around here so we need lots of traps. Let's go get a pint, Khun Pan. My treat. Time passed, flowers withered Petals, leaves and pollen falter Falling like rain On the world over yonder Dark sky spells disaster Brighten up, dear sir. It's Jerd's wedding. We live for the moment. We either make love or shoot each other dead. You never know, we might get shot by someone like you at any time. You know I'll arrest you at the first opportunity. Catch me if you can. Now let me enjoy myself first. Why did you choose to work in Bandit Town? And why did you join the police? To uphold the law. Sometimes the law favours the bad. Like me. A doctor has to save both the hero and the villain. Look, these young people... are the future of this country. But they rise against the government and they're deprived of a chance to live a normal life. We all became bandits for one reason. We want to steal our own life back. Cheers, sir. Move! I make sure my guests are happy and well-fed especially a rising-star of an officer like you. The bastard son of the Field Marshal himself. I wouldn't tolerate anything less than perfection. Eat up. Feed it up your own ass. Captain you and your men will go to a tribunal. What tribunal? Captain! Before we reach our verdict does anyone want to speak up? I propose that we let them live. Just lock them up here. Killing state officers will only bring us harm. If the police raid us again we'll have them as collateral. They are more useful alive than dead. Stop daydreaming. We're not going to let these people live a normal life again. I don't care about others all I want is to kill that traitor Khun Pan. Kill them! We have decided that bandits and police cannot co-exist. The tribunal is sentencing them to death immediately. Zip it! But Khun Pan once took the water oath with us so we'll let him decide his own fate in a duel with Dam. No, Elders! Mahesuan, stop! Stand down. Move! Wait! Hey! No! Kill them all. Kill them! Kill them all! Goodbye, Captain. No! Bandit Dam! Bandit Dam! Bandit Dam! Bandit Dam! Bandit Dam! There's no rule. All weapons are allowed. The only condition is it's a one-on-one. Anyone who interferes will be shot. I may be an outlaw to the bone but I never harmed women and children like you did. Hide me from the left. Cloak me from the right. Khun Pan! (Chanting incantation) If you surrender, I'll let you live! Dam! Orn, my love! Orn, hang in there! Dam. Orn! Orn! Orn, my love! Run. No! Orn! - Orn! - Run. Orn. Orn! Orn! Run! - Run! - Orn! Kill them! Your magic is fading. Remember... I'm Bandit Dam and I'll never shoot a wounded dog. Let's fight without sorcery. Bandit Dam! Hey! Are you ready, Khun Pan? Come on, Dam! Be careful, Dam! Keep fighting! Hang in there! - Dam, get up! - Get up! - Dam, get up! - Get up! Hey! Dam, get up! Get up! Get up! Dam! Shoot. Shoot. Shoot! Khun Pan you're insulting me. Rules... are rules! (Chanting incantation) Dam you're the real deal. This time, it's a tie. Whenever you want a rematch I'll be ready. Khun Pan. You're the real deal. But is your boss... also real? Mahesuan you'll be his guarantor. If he causes trouble you and the Whiteshirts will pay with your lives. I swear on my life and my men's. Well. Lock him up. Let's go, sir. Stay here tonight. Tomorrow I'll have someone free you. We have a lot to discuss. Like what? You and I have nothing to discuss. You are all thieves! You have one night to think about it. Tomorrow you can tell me. I believe this is yours. Something of importance. Do you think he'll help us? I don't know. Let him calm down first and I'll talk to him again. If he refuses I'll have to kill him. Don't worry just come back in time for our son's birth. I promise, son. Ohm, undo the padlock. Unfasten the restraint. Ohm, undo the padlock. Unfasten the restraint. Ohm, undo the padlock. Unfasten the restraint. Shit! Where is he? We've run out of medicine. A lot of people will die. Mahesuan! What? - What? - Khun Pan has run away! What should we do? Go! Find him! Quickly! Or we'll all be dead! Go up there! Come with me! Khun Pan has escaped! Hunt him down! I'll fucking get you! He's here! He's gone! I found him! He's here! Hide me from the left. Cloak me from the right. You left me with no choice. I'm sorry, Khun Pan. Stop! Don't do it, Mahesuan. This isn't going to solve anything. A bomb! We were lucky that Mahesuan rescued us. It's the only way for us to be safe. Safe from what? Have you heard about the Newland Project? It was a secret state project that sucked up a huge budget personally approved by the Field Marshal. We were on the supervising committee. It was a construction of a new capital city a factory to produce Japanese money to use during the war. It was backed by Japanese officials and involved corruption extortion murder and working with outlaws. The men rounded up to work here were marginalized minorities poor villagers and anti-government dissidents on the run. The government framed them for terrorism forced them to work here and had them do other illegal work in exchange for future freedom. Yes. They knew that the project was doomed from the start. This jungle was infested with malaria and wild beasts. Soon the construction workers... dropped dead in large numbers. There was no registry. People arrived, worked and died. Then the Allied bombing erased all traces of atrocity. We have incriminating evidence on film and documents bearing the Field Marshal's signature as well as proof of rampant corruption. We wanted to expose this in Parliament after Sa-nguan returned from China. But the government was alerted and they want to take us out. But Sa-nguan... was killed by Bandit Dam. No. We were there to rescue Sa-nguan. Captain Tatthep's real mission is to destroy all evidence and to kill everyone here. Now you understand... that you're a victim just like us. They sent you to help them kill us all. Mahesuan! - Doctor...! - Help! Doctor! - Doctor...! - Help the girl! - Please help my girl! - Help her. - Here. - Please help. Doc. Give him the medicine. My girl's having a seizure! Hold her! Mahesuan. Mahesuan... Take my medicine. She's going to die, take it! - Nim! Nim! - Yes? - Check his blood pressure! - Doc. Let me through. Mahesuan! Mahesuan! Mahesuan! I don't want to die. I want to get out and see my mother. You'll make it. You're not going to die! Soon we'll get out of here. You'll get to see your mother soon. Hang in there! Mahesuan, this way! This way, Doctor! Doctor... can I ask you something? Why did Mahesuan become an outlaw? He was framed for the murder of his wife after trying to expose a corrupt bureaucrat. But what he's doing is against the law. What if the law favours the wicked... can we still believe in it? It's time to redeem yourself, Khun Pan. My gang have decided to turn ourselves in. Mahesuan I'm sorry. I can't do that. Surrender is not in my dictionary. Mark my words... you're sending your men to their death. The police will keep sending men to hunt us down. When this team is gone they will send another one. And even if we could survive malaria starvation will eventually kill us. If we don't surrender now they will execute us all. We can't spend the rest of our lives robbing people. We're outlaws. We've been nothing but outlaws. That's our destiny. After this last robbery we'll abandon Bandit Town. Elders, what do you think? We'll go with Dam. Dam... I have one last request. Khun Pan is very important to my plan. Can you spare him? Mahesuan... you have your plan I have mine. Bullet-stopping Mahesuan amulet. Powerful stuff. It only stops the bullets that my eyes can see. If someone shoots me from behind, I'm out. First Draft The Sorcerer Lawman Would you mind me taking a look? I'd be honoured. But it's not entirely factual. I've made it a fantasy. Upright Officer Charged with Excessive Use of Violence Media Puts Pressure on the State to Solve the Case of Three Missing MPs Righteous Khun Pan Should Head the Investigation Mahesuan and Dam Behind Outrageous Robbery! MP Sa-nguan Murdered Officers Fought and Died on Duty Police Assign Khun Pan to the Kidnapping Case Reiterates the Investigation is Not to Please the Media A question here, sir. Are you going to give up? You've lured me out here, right? Why did you pick me? Because you're a symbol of justice. The people you see here belong to different factions. Old men who survived malaria and raids but who couldn't reveal themselves to the state became bandits. Some are students and peasants fleeing political persecution. Then, there are those who were born outlaws. The Blackshirts. Bandit Fai had brought us together under his leadership. But when Fai died we split into two factions. Some want to surrender and some want only to be caught dead. The Blackshirts are die-hard bandits with lengthy rap sheets so they can't turn their lives around. But more than half of us want to go back to our families. You always said that if the bandits surrender you'll take them in alive. Do you still go by that rule? Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? - Boss. - Why are you crying? Sorn just went out. He's left this for you. I've enclosed my resignation letter and my last chapter of The Sorcerer Lawman. Print it, as you promised. He also left you another package. What is with this bloke? Mahesuan and gang will give themselves up to Khun Pan only three days from now. This is it! This scoop will save our newspaper! All of you will get paid at the end of the month! Print this first thing in the morning. Don't miss the deadline. Sure, Boss. But tonight stop working! I'm buying everyone beer! What's your take on Mahesuan's intention to surrender? Mahesuan will turn himself in to Khun Pan We have to remain cautious. This may be just another trick in his bag. Is the disappearance of the three politicians involved in this development? Do you think Mahesuan will return the three abducted men or do you think they're already dead? Khun Pan has been silent on this. Mahesuan said he'd only surrender to Khun Pan. What's your take on that? We'll hold an internal meeting and will let you know, thank you. That'd be all for today. We'll let you know when we have more information. Sir! That's all for today. That's all for today. That's all for today. Shit! Sir! A suspicious package! Could be a bomb, sir! Shit! Sir, I guarantee that everything you're watching is the truth. All the evidence and witnesses are extremely important. I don't trust anyone to review it except you alone. I've found the three politicians here. They're safe. The truth is contrary to what you think. The three politicians will testify that these bandits are innocent. Please revoke your order of execution. I will bring them to justice without any prejudice. You once told me about the ideology of the police. Sir, I'm trying to uphold that ideology. Sir, you must not listen to him. The country is not ready. Parliament will be thrown into chaos if the Field Marshal steps down. The police will feel the heat. Can we really trust Khun Pan? He could be working with the bandits. You're talking about one of the country's best police officers. While we're getting praised by the press he's out there risking his life like a real officer. Aren't you ashamed of the stars on your shoulders? I will help him. Everyone, prepare for your journey. You're going back to your beloved families. As you all know I can't guarantee that my plan to surrender will ensure our safety or our survival. So I want each of you to write a letter to your loved one. Keep the letter with you. When your life is in danger pass the letter to your friend. We'll take an oath of blood. We'll do whatever it takes to deliver those letters to your families. Pack your things. Tonight will be our last night in Bandit Town. After we leave, we may never meet again. You look beautiful in your doctor's coat. It's a bit too late to court me. May I have a dance with you? I'm sorry For bringing you here and for all that you had to go through. I'm a doctor... Sending these people home to their families is the most important thing. Thank you for trying to do the same. For me? Can you help us? We're having a child. We don't want to die here. Really? I promise. (Khun Pan.) (I trust you, sir.) (Can you promise me?) (I promise.) (Thank you.) Love you with all my heart. Butr Pantharak. Thank you for letting me finish my letter first. You knew that I came in. You stink of opium. Who wouldn't? Without opium... I would've blown my brains out before I could do that you. Tell me. After you've shot me will you be freed from your own circle of hell? You and I... should burn in hell together! Pull the trigger, Bandit Dam. But remember I never meant to kill your wife and child. Forgive me. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! You're going to have a child, right? If my daughter were alive... she'd be the same age as those girls out there. Swear on your honour... Swear on your child's life! That... you'll treat them with justice. Swear it! I swear. Ready for the journey? Here's your uniform. Please keep my letter. Mahesuan... In case I don't make it back... take everybody and run. Do not give yourself up to the police. Thank you, Khun Pan. I hope I'll see you again out there. Maybe we can even be friends. Residence of The Field Marshal Take note of the shape and the dimension. The width is 220cm. Go wait outside. This file has the list of the Blackshirts' enemies. Recruit them all. If they help us we'll remove their names from the blacklist. We're here. See that bridge? Go across it and you're on your way. Jerd. Take good care of Chaba and your child. Chaba. Sir. Is that Khun Pan? Lord Dej Jamras sent us to escort you to the command centre. The engine broke down. Government cars are lousy, sir. Please be patient. How long have you been with the police? Not long, sir. Aren't you afraid of dying? To tell you the truth, I am, sir. But I do what I'm ordered to do, sir. Oh, I heard you have powerful amulets. Haven't you, sir? Do you have one to spare? Where the hell is everyone? Show yourselves! Over there. Shit! Sir. Shit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, they ordered me to do this. Sir, I didn't mean to! My boy is still little! Sir, I'm sorry! Sir, I didn't mean to! Damn, it hit him. Khun Pan, I didn't mean to... I'm sorry. Think carefully. Don't risk your career with this move. You... don't have to do this. Your amulets make you invulnerable... I have to. I have a son. Please. Well... I'll make you a herbal potion. I'm going now. Dearest Noon I'm so sorry for not being there to help you raise our child. No matter what happens all I want to say is you and our child are the most beautiful things in my life. When I'm gone, tell him about me. Tell him the truth the good and the bad. Tell him, his father was just a human being. Everything I've done is not for my own sake but his. It's my gift to welcome him into this world. Love you with all my heart. A life for a life. Butr! Butr... Hang on. One, two, three. Pull him up! Let go of self and everything around you. When there's no self there's no need for any protective spell. But remember I never meant to kill your child or your wife. Forgive me. Remember this. The newborn will save your life. (Chanting incantation) Bia, get him out of there. Yes. I pray to Rahul. To Deva. To Shiva. Please descend. Wander in all directions. Rahul the saviour. Use what I taught you to protect people until your final moment. - Butr, put your hands together. - Hey. Repeat after me. (Chanting) Divine beings force the bullet out with buddho. Divine beings force the bullet out with buddho. With thammo. With thammo. With sangkho. With sangkho. Look at you... Bandit Bai. Thank you for saving my life. Save your thank-you for Bandit Dam. What? He told me to follow you here. You should get up and go. Tatthep is coming this way with his men. They're going to kill everyone in Bandit Town. Tatthep? How could that be? I saw him get shot with my own eyes. Kill them all! Kill them all. Goodbye, Captain. No! It was a setup. He was shot by a blank bullet. Tatthep conspired with Chief Nome to betray us. I make sure my guests are happy and well-fed especially you the bastard son of the Field Marshal. I wouldn't tolerate anything less than perfection. Eat up. Captain, I can help you and your men. Will you hear my proposal? I'm a respected officer. I don't negotiate with scum like you. Don't touch me! Captain, I can be useful to you. We can work together to get rid of all the bandits. If we succeed you can tell the government how useful I am. Let me out! You'll persuade them to make me a sheriff and I'll bring other gangs of the Central Plains under my watch while you become a Parliament hotshot. As for your father's underground businesses I will take over them all. Deal? Deal? - Deal. - You swear? I swear. Swear on your life. - Swear on my life. - Say it! I swear on my life! I swear on my life! Let me out of here! You're relieved of your duty. You're no longer one of my officers. From now on you're responsible for your own actions. Do you understand? Yes. Father. Wait. I'll give you one last chance. These are the names of the Blackshirts' enemies. Recruit them. Tell them if they help us they'll be off the blacklist. I want to make this look like a score-settling between outlaw gangs. The police want you killed. It means they never meant to let us live either. They want all of us dead. Go help him! You too. Like walking to the gallows. Mahesuan is so dumb. We wouldn't be bandits if we were so smart. Right, brother? I guess you're right. Let's go. Go. Go. I can trust you, can't I? We're in the same boat now. If I couldn't be trusted you wouldn't be standing here. I don't care what you're doing. Just stand clear when I shoot. Oh, Lord of the Worlds. I command the four guardians of hell to resurrect all ghosts from their graves. (Chanting incantation) - Hurry up. - Stay strong. Move! - Hurry up! - Put it together. Go, go! - Quickly! - This way! Quickly! You got everything? This way. You got everything? Use the small truck. Take this, too. (Still no movement from Khun Pan?) (Nothing.) Prepare to set out. Go easy. We'll go slowly. Be careful. Let's start moving! Move! Watch out! Take cover! Quick! Look out! Hurry up! Doc! Hurry up! There's no time! Go, go! Chaba! This way! Come on, quickly! Kill them all! Go! Shit! Tough motherfucker! Just die! Kill him! Take cover! Take cover! Hide! Get me a towel! How bad is it? If we pull out the knife she'll bleed to death. If we don't, we can't take her with us. Pull it out and stitch it up. Do it. Cloth. Tweezers. Clamp. (Chanting incantation) Cut it! What now? These guys aren't from the state. They're rogue killers sent to murder us. We have to take the wounded to safety. Take everyone to the bunker. - Now! - Now! Hurry up! - Go, go! - Hurry! - Go! - Quickly! - Go! - Go! Jerd! Watch out! - Jerd! - Jerd! - Jerd! - Jerd! Jerd! Jerd! Get to the bunker! Go now! Down here! Kill them! Come on! Bandits, attack! - Go down there! Quickly! - Go! I'll be right behind you. Just go! Come, Doc. Butr, come! Go. Quickly! Don't let them get away! Find them! Look over there. Hurry up! Spread out! - Hey! - What's that? There are so many of them! What the fuck is this? Watch out! It's coming! Shoot them down! Shoot them! Doc! Help! Dam, go help them over there! I'll take care of this shit! Back to hell, demon! - Follow me! - You're dead! Kill them! - You fucker! Let go! - You fucker! We're out of ammo. Elder, what now? Let's show them our bandits' laugh! Come here, Doctor! I heard the bomb. Go find them. I'll go outside to help our men. If those assassins get in here... everything I've done will be for naught. Doctor, you and everyone will get to go home. Deliver this letter for me. (Chanting incantation) (Chanting incantation) Take cover! I'll blow them up! Prick! Bai! Bia! Bia! Go to hell! (Chanting incantation) Bia, hang in there. (Chanting incantation) Doctor, help Bandit Dam! Mahesuan! This is the story of lost souls in a time of despair and faithlessness. The Sorcerer Lawman (Final chapter) Power keeps changing hands. (The end) Story by Mr Sorn Politicians stuff themselves like hungry ghosts. Siamese Sky - Young-Blooded Politicians Some idealists keep the fight going though they know they'll never win. A few days before the censure debate something happened and made the front page of every newspaper. Anonymous armed men silenced those people along with the truth. The Blackshirts dispersed and quit their lawless way. Nearly all of them returned to their families. Some vanished without a trace. So the letter has been delivered? Some returned to their loved ones. And some keep wandering without a destination. Hear me out, good folks! Our company believes in good virtue because it's something that never dies! Life needs insurance. - Life is uncertain. - Stop. - I surrender. - Don't sit around waiting. Let Thai Life Insurance take care of you from the depths of our hearts. The sky remains dark and the country has no future. People still look for a sign of hope. Someone who never bends his knees before injustice. They're waiting for him to return. Help! Help! I'm being robbed! Go, I'll watch our son. Pol. Lt. Gen. Khun Pantharak Rachadej conducted his duty with honesty righteousness and sacrifice.
