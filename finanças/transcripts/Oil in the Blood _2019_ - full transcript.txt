[MUSIC PLAYS IN BACKGROUND] I remember the first time that I got on a motorbike I just had this incredible sense that I could go anywhere do anything and you just want to ride and ride and ride. If I have a bad day, I go ride my motorbike, if I'm pissed off, I go ride my motorbike, if I'm happy and it's a great day, I go ride my motorbike. I think motorcycles are the most interesting and curious mechanical phenomenon because you straddle it, you ride it, it's a very intimate experience. There's nothing like it. I think it just makes the relationship with this machine, this curious kind of miracle of physics that is a motorcycle. It makes that relationship a lot deeper. It gets into your blood in a very real way but it literally becomes part of who you are as a human being and it starts to change you and I think it changes people for the better. When you can sit in a room with people who have devoted this much of their life to it and look at what they're doing, you know they've got a screw loose and they've got the same loose screw that I have. When you're truly addicted to riding bikes, like I am, you can't have a bike in the garage and not ride it. I'm not even making the decision to be able to ride. If there's a bike there, I'm already gone. From a logical point of view, there is no reason for a motorcycle and yet we have these infernal contraptions which are difficult, uncomfortable, dangerous and we're fascinated with them. That's what I connect to now, that's what I feel passionate about, that's what gets me up every morning and keeps me up late at night. This two wheeled transport device that is the closest thing to flying. It really is. A custom motorcycle really is a piece of mechanical art in the way that a car isn't because you look at a car, everything is hidden, it's a body and four wheels. A motorcycle, you can see it. You can see the engine, everything is on display so that's a form of art really and doing the custom thing kind of amplifies that art. There aren't many ways to express who you are these days you know it's an era of mass production. Everybody had the same phone, everybody had the same car. You know, you live in a shoe box in a suburb. But a bike is saying 'this is who I am, this is me as an individual'. So this bike here, that was found in somebody's front garden. It was the perfect example of what we could take and turn into this bike over here. The whole point is to work on your own thing and make it individual to yourself and not have something that everyone else has got, to have your character stamped on something you've built. Yeah there's bits that I've had to make for it. There's some Heath Robinson stuff on there. It doesn't function perfectly, it's not the quickest bike in the world but it's my bike. Having something unique is far cooler than having a mass-produced motorcycle. Apparently. It's about individuality and going into a Triumph dealership, a Ducati or Harley dealership, and saying 'l want mine a bit like that' it gives about as much individuality as getting a different colour phone case for your iPhone, your generic iPhone. I love seeing people doing stuff that no-one's seen before. Good or bad, you just make the craziest thing you can think of every time around. You know, like when people just go way outside the box. Just throw the rule book out. What we don't have enough of is actual real individuals and I think someone like David from El Solitario is a great example of someone who genuinely is a fucking individual. I love David as a human being, he can be a total asshole you know, but I love him to death. He's so genuine. He's definitely put himself out there as far as bikes go. His most hated bike was also, I think, his most publicised bike by far. That BMW Nine T, you know. The thing looks like a shopping cart but it photographed so awesome and it had so much vibe to it. When Paul designated this formula, I know the world's most hated motorcycle I found it really funny so I adopted it because it just made fun of it. It took some of my grief out. We were a tiny company and suddenly this huge monster calls us and says â€˜hey we want to do a motorcycle with you, we're going to pay you, you have creative freedom'. I wanted to make them proud. I thought everybody was going to love it. I never in my life thought everybody would hate it. But I also understood, I knew enough that I had done something really amazing. I just embraced my personality and tried to make a company out of it and that's like a myth buster and I can... OK let's fuck it up. I think it's defined very much more by the rider than the bike itself. Everyone seems to be riding different bikes, their interests go off in different areas where there's some into choppers, some into flat tracker, some into racing is that it's much more of a level playing field. It's less about money and budget and what you can afford and what you can do. The people who have spent their time doing stuff, learning stuff, researching stuff, living motorcycling. Today if you look at really what's happening in New York, it's a bunch of $500 Hondas. They throw the seat away and put a plank of wood on there that's this size and that's a custom bike. It's like 'yvou go for it dude' and if that's who's riding by then he's using his bike, that's cool. I like the fact that people actually... they'll buy a motorcycle and cut it up and do something and people are always asking 'how do you get started?' and dude, just make the cut and then you've started. Breathing life back into a dead engine is creativity by essence. You breathe life back, you created life where there was no more life. I didn't expect it to be a culture that had so much depth on the engineering side and the artistry and the community. I think that trifecta is very relevant today. It's like it doesn't matter if you're a race bike guy or a drag bike guy or a street bike guy. Nobody judges. Or some people do but who cares about them. It's cool when people, they do what they want and that's when the purest stuff comes out. This cool thing that's happening, I think we're just really lucky to be around it while it's actually happening. The motorcycling world is becoming like an estuary where it's all mixing and I think all these cultures are coming together and there's going to be a lot of clashing and a lot of people are going to hate that that's happening get over it, it's happening. The motorcycle world is changing and honestly I think it's changing for the better. The new, sort of, custom scene has empowered a lot of people, it's democratised people to feel like they can make a motorcycle which is huge because, from the 90s onwards, motorcycles had become appliances they'd become so good, you didn't need to know how to do anything because there was nothing to do. If it broke, you couldn't fix it anyway. If you want to call it a new wave scene, then fine but I would just call it an evolution of motorcycling. Originally it was a conversation that John Copeland had with Jeffrey Shad. There wasn't really a show that showcased builders in the aesthetic quality that they appreciated. So just giving a platform and opportunity to have people show off their work. It's the invitational because we go out of our way to invite someone to showcase something that they've created, that we really appreciate. I think good work speaks for itself and it doesn't need to be a certain style, a certain era, a certain period, you know, amazing work is amazing work no matter what kind of bike it is. A lot of people ask that we should get a bigger space, more bike and what not but I think it's good to have that small amount of bikes, more exclusive, and also you get to spend more time with each bike to just enjoy. We want to kind of create the event that we can bridge those gaps, celebrate the whole culture of motorcycles. You'll see your Fortune 500 CEO sitting right next to a Hell's Angel guy and both of them are appreciating the same thing. I mean, I never see them in any other context other than that, things like these shows, like the invitational, do that. It just forces people to participate in each other's world. But there's no awards. There's no 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place. That's another thing that's cool. You can't really judge these bikes against each other. Because they're all so different so to me just being on the list and having that recognition is just enough. It's all you really want. It's cool. I think motorcycles themselves are counter-cultural. They're intimidating, they're aggressive, they're fast, they're dangerous. Ever since the first bike came, someone wanted to pull it apart, individualise it, make it faster, tweak it, and put their own personality into it. Motorcycles are cool, they've always been cool and if you had been alive in 1910, you would have thought motorcycles were cool because they were cool and guess what? they still are cool. We're on this little tip of the present and there's 150 years of interesting stuff that's every bit as cool as what's happening today. There's a history of bike that you need to understand and be aware of but at the end of the day, you're a free person, you can do whatever you want. But I think you need an understanding of what's gone on before you in some respect and then you can make a judgement call on certain things but if you just ignore everything, you're just a prick. The historical roots in this, you could go back to after the second world war in America where all the soldiers came back and they chopped up Harleys and that's where the bobber scene came from. In the UK it was from the 60s, from the Cafe Racers, the Ton Up boys, trying to make their bikes lighter. It wasn't about aesthetics then, it was making it as fast as possible. It was back in the 50s/60s where, when there was no surf going on in California they would get on their Triumphs and BSAs and Nortons and head off into the hills so that culture moved on and then changing their bikes, adapting their bikes. In the late 50s, California motorcycle clubs, especially started to alter their motorcycles to make them lighter and longer and more elegant and eventually these became painted wildly and chromed as the 50s went into the 60s they began to alter the frames and they became choppers by the early 1960s as we know them. And the ultimate expression of the chopper were the bikes that you see in Easy Rider. Exposure on television in the early 2000s really grew the awareness for the general public to custom bikes. The Jesse James stuff, Orange County Choppers, and people like that but 2008, economic depression, and killed a lot of the custom bike world. You know, same thing with us, I mean at a point, we're building huge ZX14 or a Busa stretched thing, they're expensive machines and then the market collapses, I remember the photo shoot we were on when the market collapsed. It was a reset. Customs had become kind of grotesque and then the reset happens and you have a $1000 motorcycle with $500 worth of money put into it from a guy who just learned how to weld two weeks ago and you're looking at it going ... it's compelling. It may not ride for shit but it's a cool looking bike. It seems like 2008 was the year, there was the big crash, everybody had all those big bikes and they couldn't sell them. And it took the whole industry back to square one and I think it made a lot of us re-think what we were doing, what was important, not to be corny but I think it brought back the soul of motorcycling. People were buying cheap Japanese bikes 300/500, whatever the money was and making that vehicle your own because you would do it still in an affordable way something that was unique. And that was, you know, a wake up call for me. It was a wake-up call for the whole company. So Analog Motorcycles started in 2008. I built a custom bike was kind of um... on a whim. Did it. After the bike was done it got a lot of press. Started getting people randomly, all over the country, asking me to build a custom. It started to take off, build steam, then in 2013 I started to quit my day job and go full time and I haven't looked back. I grew up riding on the back of my dad's Vincent and he grew up riding on the back of his dad's Vincent. So there's quite, family influences there. I lost my bike license through speeding so if I couldn't ride a bike I thought I'd build one. I spent a few years as a flaming alcoholic and when I got through all of that I started working a lot to keep my mind away from that so maybe I just transferred one actual addiction to a new one, I don't know. I was in the foreign service for many years and built motorcycles on the side as a second job. I usually started my evening at 7 o'clock in the workshop and I worked until midnight, 1 o'clock in the morning. Over time it just became the focus of my life and now the last 12 years it's a full time business. Yeah I started out mainly in advertising, I was in a big agency in Richmond Virginia for about 11 years. I got laid off. They came and told me and everything kind of went in slow motion for a second and like, oh I'm getting laid off. But at the same time I felt like it was actually liberating. I'm not going to go back to advertising and do that stuff when I could start building motorcycles â€˜cause I'd already been doing it for a while. I had a great job with a start-up company doing really cool work, getting patents, designing the coolest stuff with all the resources I could ever want, an engineers dream job, with a great group of guys and I was like, nah, I'm going to leave, I'm going to move to Texas, I'm going to start a motorcycle shop and they're like 'you're nuts, you're out of your mind, you're destined to be broke for the rest of your life' which so far is not that far off. And I'm saying â€˜no come be a broke dick with me, let's have nothing.' I didn't even get into motorcycles, I didn't have a choice. My whole family in Lebanon/Syria were metal workers, tinsmiths and mechanics and when they came here, they brought tools. My father had 60/70 bikes in the yard. I was 15, 16 where he told me 'if you can fix one of those bikes in the back, you can have it'. I worked for a large bank for 6 years, I was a manager there and I definitely could have continued my career in the bank but it just wasn't me. We could feel that there was something going on, when we did the blogging, we see the number of visitors just... so I think it was more accidental that we just happened to do that at the time when other people got more or less the same idea. Wheels & Waves started as the Southsiders anniversary. There was a party, they did in Toulouse, and we were like, 20 guys then the idea of making a bigger, better show, more happening in Vincent's brain and the Southsiders with Jerome. One summer we said, OK we're going to do it. We're going to do this event, it's going to be called Wheels & Waves. It was about bringing everything that is cool about motorcycles without looking at the different scenes as independent entities. It was something that had never been done before. We just, from a profound love of motorcycles, especially Vincent ahead of it, of the movement, he wanted to build a really inclusive event. This is really bigger than us. This is much bigger than us and there is not one Wheels & Waves, there are thousands of Wheels & Waves. It just depends of what yours looks like. Wheels & Waves now is just an excuse for motorcycle freaks to travel, take a week off work, and ride with your buddies. That's the thing. Yeah that's the thing, you live it. You're not just a spectator, you're an actor of the events. The surfing competition, the punk's peak competition, the dirt track competition, the ridings with the people, even the hanging out in the city with your bikers, your crew. You are part of it and you're there. I don't know so many of us that have the same spirit. For me we are in the middle of what motorcycles should look like. That's what's so cool about this place. Anything goes and the rules are very loose. And that's what's so inspiring. People take whatever they find and they build a cool custom out of it. It's not all about money and it's just a totally different thing. And people ride it here. Everyone is riding. The very cool thing about flat track racing is that you can't go to a factory and say 'can I have a dirt track bike' 'cause it doesn't exist. You have to build it and after that you can race. So that's why the custom scene, building the bikes, and racing, that's why I think they are, be the same. It's like family but it's racing on a track. There is no bad elbow, everything is fine. Everybody is a friend but on the track everybody is on the gas. I mean, what's the first thing you do when you're a kid? You either try and wheelie a bike, jump a bike or skid a bike. So if you're just going around skidding all day, what could be more fun? On one hand we have the industry, I think they were lost. It's got to a point where it wasn't relevant any more, for the customers and in the other hand, we have this custom scene which is full of talent and I think we speak the language, the new language they need to speak. It really is a case of the people have spoken. Something that's more accessible, more stylish, literally going down to the nearest cafe and back is what people want. The barrier to entry is so low in terms of cost which is perhaps where it all started. The social barrier to entry is lower. You don't need to feel scared turning up at a big biker event where everyone is going to expect you to do a wheelie. One of the things I like about motorcycles and always have liked about motorcycles is that they're very democratic. And yes you can buy expensive motorcycles, but you can buy a cheap motorcycle and you can have a go. You know, you can pick a 125 on eBay for 400 quid, do your own little mods, and rock around town and be very proud of it. That's great. What excites me personally and our team is young people just getting in and getting their hands dirty and making stuff. Creating their own personal expression and that becomes a snowball, right. There's only a couple of thousand people in the world who are customising motorcycles now. But their visibility and the number of people interested in seeing that, is huge so the ripple effect is where the big impact is. I think the blog was initially the biggest thing - Bike Shed, Bike EXIF, Pipeburn all those sorts of things. People then can really start following what other people are up to and there's normally a story with all the pictures and then when there was an opportunity for an event to come on, and people could see these bikes in the flesh. Yeah my name's Thor and honestly, I don't know how I got here. Time travelling. No, I run The One Motorcycle Show, just a hobby gone wild. It just got away from me a little. It would be hard for me to say that I started a movement because it could have just been everybody was ready for something different. What I was doing was counter to everything that I'd experienced. I didn't want to be like anybody else. I didn't want to battle with other shows. I didn't want to take their customers, I wanted to create something new and different. So everything that we've done, we've done it the hard way. Because it's counter, and make something that people say like 'wow, it's free'. Nothing's free any more. And then they say 'why don't you charge?' and then the right people will come and I say 'that defeats the purpose of having the show, to get everybody to come' and definitely the biggest part of it is we look towards the sponsorships for covering the costs of putting on the show. Harley Davidson and BMW have been huge supporters of the show and Icon since day one. There's dirt bikes and there's race bikes and there's just hardcore choppers all together in one show. To me that's the brilliant part of the One Show because as a motorcyclist, I do all those things and to be able to see all those communities come together at One Show is really quite remarkable. But the One Show for sure is still a place where your $1500 build commands respect for exactly what it is. Every builder that's got a bike in there, I can't promise them anything. They haven't paid any money to enter the bike,they've come from all over the world. A lot of people spending a lot of money to get here and I can't say that they're going to have world fame for it but you've just got to show up and see what happens. Be part of it. The one thing about the One Show is that it's not a single bike show. It's putting the custom umbrella over ever sort of custom and by casting that big net, you basically put a big spotlight up to anybody that was doing a custom bike. Got everyone's attention to it and that's what has allowed it to grow. We have put on a few races and many of the races for fun. It's just part of human nature to like race so the only thing that will kind of sustain itself for a long time is racing and then I clearly saw the whole picture from the person who's never raced to the future of racing. Taking the race crowd and putting them in a setting like this is kind of interesting and the taking the guys that know about choppers and bring them down the races and the two work together. Two wheels and a motor and it's the same thing. There wasn't, I mean in '08 I think Facebook was around but there really wasn't a lot of digital media or social media starting out. When it started to pick up, we jumped on right away. It was actually the first guy I hired, a guy that was a photographer that took care of our social media. That, for most people, is our marketing. That's the window that the world sees into Analog Motorcycles. You can build something, put it online and 270,000 people reached, boom. And that's amazing. Years ago you couldn't do something like that. You needed a TV show, you needed to be in magazines for years to have people see your work. When I got into it, two magazines were coming out once a month with 3 or 4 bike features in it and it's almost like they delegated what was cool and what was not. They were deciding what was the motorcycle industry custom-wise. And now what we're seeing is we're in control of the whole thing really. You know, now anybody who put their name out there, people can see it. And if you do good work, people want to see it so they start following you and shit. It's not the guy with the huge name who always has the upper hand. We as consumers of this information, consumers of this content, are getting things instantly. You can see what I made 20 minutes ago and I can walk you around it live on the internet. I don't know if something's lost or something's gained. It goes one way or another, 10 minutes later you've got to do something new. The longevity of custom bikes online can be surprisingly short. 24 / 48 hours. For something that could've taken a year to build, that's a really short life. OK I saw that yesterday, what's out there today? And that's 3 years of a man's life you looked at yesterday. What do you mean what have you got now? People come out and they're Instagram, they're Insta-famous. They get all this going and then the business comes after the fame, you know what I mean? I think we need to be careful and not let the internet or the social media kind of start drowning out the camaraderie and the coolness of what the culture actually is. So it's so easy to criticise when you do nothing. Actually the people who make never criticise. They respect the fact that you made. The haters will be haters forever. We don't give a fuck. We know who we are, where we come from, where we want to go. Yeah we get builders who are clearly at their wits end and they've been working their arses off for like, 12 months on a bike and you'll get some peanut gallery blow hard who will just leave a really pithy one sentence remark and yeah, builders will crumble at that. And they like nothing better than getting you to engage them â€˜cause no matter what, you're going to come out looking like an asshole. There's been so many times I've wanted to just go right for the jugular and be like, 'listen it might have been a bad weld but your girlfriend's fat'. You know, 'l checked out your page' and I've been dying to say that for so long, something like that. But at the end of the day, I look around me and I get to do this for a living so if I'm going to have the occasional people online telling me that I'm an idiot and I can't weld, and I suck at building motorcycles, I can live with that. If you do say why you don't like it, give the alternative, like it could be this but criticism, not just being negative because you're not really helping by being negative. But yeah, whatever. People are mean. I've had death threats. There was one guy who emailed, 'you fucking faggot, will you stop showing these fucking gay bikes, I'm going to come â€˜round to your fucking house and kill you'. My biggest problem is people on Instagram don't do anything other than Instagram. They'll look at it and they won't even read the text that says the thing they're asking. They'll just post up the question. â€˜What bike is that?' It says right there, it's a BMW R100. Like, it's not that hard! The American magazine Cycle World, they do events marketing so the big opportunity they see is running motorcycle shows. People paying $10/$20 to get though the door in a show. And that's why people like Revival who are really smart because they figured that out, and the Bike Shed as well so the event really is a gold mine. I'm Vikki van Someren, the queen of fucking everything and I run the Bike Shed for London, Paris, Milan and the rest of the world. We were sat in a pub and we were about to go to a bike show and we were all having that Carlsberg moment when you sit there and say, you know, what if we put on a show? And a week later, my husband booked a venue I think because, as bikers, we were tired of the same old trade format. You know, the rubbish food, the Lycra girls and we wanted something that was more reflective of us as individuals. You know, when you look around this is everybody's individual style through their motorcycle. So Bike Shed One was a punt, it was an idea. We ran the show for free, we had two arches in Shoreditch and 70 bikes if I remember correctly. It was very much a pop-up, amateur vibe to it. But 3,000 people turned up. That summer of 2012, the whole scene suddenly found its voice and started to feel like something tangible. We were trying to do something that was the opposite of a trade fair. It needed to be a destination, a place worth going. It needed to be about the creative side of motorcycle culture. There's people come here to check out the latest build from XYZ builder, but there's a lot of people come here just to gain inspiration and see what someone else did in their shed or garage or workshop and think well I can go away and I'm going to do that myself and maybe come back next year and enter my bike into a show. Or people just want to come and have a look at beautiful things, beautiful engineering and I think here you've got it in spades. I think this is far more about style. There's decent food, there's decent drink, things to look at. It's a nice experience. In fact, you'd have a nice experience here even if you weren't a biker. It's really important for us. It's important because it's the first contact point with our customer, this kind of customer. Because we can learn, we can talk with these people you know and we can go back in the office with more and more ideas of what to do in the future. We only do the show so people can come and see what we do and when they see the finish on the bikes, that's when the builds start to come in. We sold six bikes in six days. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday then one on the following Monday. Â£16,500 a piece so yeah they saw our work at a show, they come and have a look at what we do, and that's it. Events like this allow people to take innovative leaps because they just feed off each other. Because as soon as somebody does something really innovative, and everyone sees it, the whole movement steps forward. We got a project with Stuart Garner, CEO at Norton and I was up there one day talking bikes with him, and just chewing the fat really and having a laugh and I said, 'l'd really like to build a bike' and his term, without swearing, was 'OK f*** off and do it'. It's a Norton Commando 961 stock road bike, that's the base bike and it's been quite modified. You're always a little bit nervous when you come up with a design for a bike and you build something, you know, you've invested a lot of time and money and you want people to love it. It's kind of a re-creation of a world famous flat track bike from the 70s designed by Ron Woods who kind of revolutionised flat track racing. We have all this technology now, we have amazing motorcycles, amazing electronics, difficult to crash, reliable, everything you could want really. You know, the benefit to progress and civilisation and we're really saying â€˜no, we don't want that.' There are entirely too many people in my opinion, that are completely removed from how the things are made that they own. And I wasn't raised that way. I was raised in a home where we typically fixed what broke. We didn't hire a repair man when the dishwasher went down. So much of the physical world these days just exists and we don't think about that at all. Where in reality, every single thing that exists, had to be created. It had to be put together. Somebody made this thing. There's this kind of re-appropriation of the making process and therefore I assume, I presume the respect of the makers. A few years ago, there was a small amount of people a small demographic that were interested in craftsmanship or the hand made thing. All of a sudden, there's a lot more people interested in the sort of things that I do. Yeah everybody that I've ever learned anything from were 50... 60... 70... 80 years old. It takes a certain amount of money and quality and dedication that I have to have in order to put my company stamp on it. It's a little sculpture by the time I'm done and I love that but if somebody just wants me to put some shit ball logo on there, I'm not going to do it. And so much effort and time learning how to do this, I'm not just going to throw it away on some pile of shit. If you start off with shit, it's just going to be a fancy piece of shit in the end. There's an element of taking the power back by doing it yourself, doing it on a budget, not being given what the big companies are selling you. The kind of people I'm getting coming to me are guys who are tech guys who just want to do something. They just want to make something. And they don't get that from their job or from daily life or whatever so they do it on a bike... and I can see there's tonnes of people like that. The feeling you get when you've built something or even had a go at building it, even if you buy parts or if you bolt on a part you bought, there's still satisfaction in that. It's just nice to be given one small problem that might take a while to overcome and if you overcome that, you're good for the day. And it's even bigger, this feeling, when you build it by yourself because you know it by heart. It's not just an object, it's a living object. I've followed everything on YouTube and I've got my manual, I know exactly what I'm doing. My caliper is perfect. And I get out on the A12, have to stop and I go smack into the back of a car. The older and rarer the bike, the more I'm intrigued. Figuring out the sources, there's these old brown papers that have been crumpled up for years that are in the back of a manual. You know, I just geek out on it. I really love it. Any of the old bikes, they just feel different. You can hear them, you can feel the motor, it just feels like you're part of it. Almost like you're on a trip with a good friend. Like it doesn't matter, even if they're being a pain in the ass that day you still know you'd rather be on the trip with them. Old bikes you can fix with two wrenches on the side of the road and go on about your business. New bikes you've got to call somebody so they can put a computer box in there, you know. People talk about old bikes like they're unreliable you know, but it's like 'no, I can fix it' and keep going. You definitely have to educate your customer on the reality of what they're asking for. They want something, they go into their garage, and they push a button and it starts every time and it's low maintenance. Is it going to be a world war 2 era knucklehead? No. If you're going to spend Â£20k customising a bike, do you want it to be worth Â£20k at the end? Because if so, you need to start with a Ducati or a Harley or something else that's got a bit of quality about it that's got some perceived value because we know from experience that you can spend as much as you want but when you come to sell a bike, If it's a CX500, they'll only pay what a CX500's worth and their argument will be, but it's a CX500. So we start always on older bikes, from the inside out. On newer bikes, we can just go from the outside in. We don't need to take them totally apart. It's the amount of bikes I've seen that have got Ohlins shocks and this and that and they've spent thousands of pounds putting all this race kit on a 750, 35 year old bike that's done 150... I mean, what the fuck is the point in that? Know what I mean? What's the point? A lot of builders I speak to will say to me, 'l won't work on old bikes any more' They spend the first 100 hours of a build just stripping a bike and re-finishing it and re-making it. All they've done is restore a bike and they've spent half the budget and then they've got to spend the same money again to customise it. I think I prefer modern bikes because of the performance I love big tyres, big brakes, all the race shit actually It's crazy to drive that kind of bike because you're flying. You can't really get in and customise new stuff as much as you can old stuff. That's the thing, I've been doing this 2017 model, it's like I can't re-wire that thing. You've got to be an electrical engineer to re-wire that thing and even then you're going to have some problems, you know. You can't really do anything with the injections stuff that... without computer that only the dealership is allowed to have. I've also ridden some motorcycles that have been very de-clawed by technology. You know, you get on a bike and all of a sudden you can't do a burn out, you can't ride a wheelie, you can't skid the rear break. I don't even want to ride it. I don't even care if it makes 200 horse power. If you're stuck with a new bike and you can't change anything because the computer packs up and goes into shutdown because it senses a new headlight being put on well the whole industry is in trouble. When people come up and and say a bike is like, OK, that's the budget but I can go buy a new bike for that price. Yeah.. yes.. I can get a brand new one for that. Yeah. Maybe that's what already happened with the customers. They're buying new bikes. When you get new bikes that look like custom bikes if you don't know the difference. It gives them a soft landing into the scene. People see a bike, they see the individualism of the bike probably thinking, oh that's awesome, I'm never able to build that myself and in the past that means this scene's not for you. But right now if you see new bikes coming out from manufacturers that have the same air to them as the bikes in this scene. Yeah you come to a show like this, and there's so much stuff but it all comes down to the crowd. It doesn't matter what you like in motorcycles, or don't like, for me it's all about the craftsmanship and the work and just the attitude and the style and the bike doesn't have to be a trailer queen to be a winner. Yeah I think one of the good things about these shows is most of us especially those of us that live in the colder climates, it's just like we're in our own little world in our shop just working away, doing all this. I found over the years, my social life has become less and less. I think that's the good thing about these shows, that we come for the social aspect of the business. When you bring it out it's like, 'Aw, where have you been for all these months?" Well I was doing this. That something that a show like this, a hand built show, proves is you can take any kind of bike and build something really cool. You can go outside the box no matter what. You don't have to have a knucklehead to build a cool bike. We would go to motorcycles shows and it would always be the same fucking thing. There was some old curmudgeon asshole, or 400 of them, that would treat you like you wouldn't know shit because you didn't have any grey hair or facial hair, and it was always like you were not, you were automatically excluded from their fucking club. It was called the Handbuilt Motorcycle Show because these are people like us with limited resources and they're building something with their hands and learning that that actually has value. Let's create something that we try our best to allow it to be instead of determining what it should be. Does that make sense? What's been the most satisfying part of that, in doing what we're doing with the event and all this other stuff, is seeing other people's personal discovery. There are multiple people that have come to this little show we do which was just an excuse to bring together a bunch of guys that we respected who've never even thought of a motorcycle but they came, they looked and they went 'vou know what, maybe they're right maybe I can do this' and now there were multiple bikes in the show this year that were built because they went to the first show. The fact that the Wall of Death is there is not just an accident. That's not just like 'oh this might be kind of cool'. No that was a conscious thought of... we want to find a way to get people that don't ride to have the visceral experience of what it's like to ride somehow. Just to give them some small taste of it. To get up close and personal with functioning bikes. Before, it was niche and it was sub-culture, and it was a little bit more people in the know, but social media has just attracted a bigger volume and that means you do see more couples and more young people and more people from just outside the scene on the fringes. If we don't attract new people into the it and make them passionate about it, motorcycles won't exist in 20 years time. They'll be legislated out existence. Yeah we need more people with energy, we need more doers and it's the young people who are kind of coming in from a new angle. They haven't been influenced in the past and they're pushing it in new directions and that's what any progressive culture needs. All production, all manufacturing, the ability to do things with your hands is largely exited, it's gone. We outsource everything. And it's really... I don't think anyone expected it but it's really our generation that like 'wait a minute, our dads, our grandparents used to do this. If they could do it, we can definitely do it.' I'm so sick of these people who have been in the business for a long time getting pissed off with these newcomers. It's like, at some point you were a newcomer. They're like, who cares. Well five years ago they were riding skateboards. Who gives a fuck? Now they're riding a motorcycle. Good. There is a younger demographic that is interested in motorcycling and custom motorcycles and choppers and cafes and it's affordable and anybody can still do it. You've got kids of 22 right the way through to people who are 62. If they've only got Â£2k, they can get into this. At the other end of the extreme, if you want to got to one of the well-known makers, put down Â£18k/Â£22k, you can do that as well. And again, like buying it, you can buy a 125 and make it cool. It's just cheap and affordable and if you feel cool riding a 125 you've pimped out, that's rad. And now there's this new breath of air, there's a fresh interest in the younger demographic and I think it's inspiring. If you look at the custom scene, it's much much younger which is gold dust for the manufacturers. Instead of selling motorcycles to retired dentists, who are going to be dead in 10 years time, you've got somebody who has a 30 year buying life cycle. It's really important to make sure that younger people getting into the scene are made to feel welcome. It's not going to grow from the same old guys building the same old stuff. It's going to grow from someone being included, having different ideas, bringing something new to it that's going to help keep it going. I'll be completely honest with you, the very first time I came here, I said, 'well we'll go but it looks like one of those hipster things.' And we showed up and I'm like, â€˜those guys have their jeans rolled up. This is one of those hipster things'. By the end of the weekend, I said you know, these guys are awesome. Ever since we started Blitz with Hugo, I never met so many interesting and interested persons in my life. All you need to do to belong is just want to belong and try to bring something on the table but try to work always with a giving sense, not like try to leave an imprint. This place has always, always been not about an individual person. It's always been about a group of people. And if we were building a bike, whoever turned up that day would work on that bike. Petrol heads, you can't help it. Motorcycles are in the blood I'm afraid. I came last year, had an amazing time, so many bikes. So many really nice people and yeah, it's a must do. Well I think the racing here, I think that's what sets this one off. The fact that people are getting to get their bikes out and come out, fire 'em up, line up, smell the smoke, see the tyres spinning, see the mud, it's just brilliant really. My name is Radical Edwards of Radical Edwards Performance. I'm here to race. I'm just here for general carrying on and fun and games and other sorts of malarkey. What's different about the Malle Mile, it's not too serious, it's a lot of fun, it's open to anybody, that just wants to bring their bike and chuck it down the track and it actually goes back to the grass roots of motorbike racing. That's really where the custom bike scene started. It's people taking their bike that they ride every day, and taking bits off it to make it go faster, race it down the road. What's the Trip Out? A lot of people get the wrong impression of it 'cause they think it's a chopper show. Yes it is a chopper show but it's also a culture show. You get to see good bikes, be with your good friends, giving people a sense of freedom, a bit of hope I suppose. A lot of people go and they've got this wannabe hard man image. Fuck all that shit mate. It's no good, is it? Sometimes you want to let your hair down and just dance to the Bee Gees. The Trip Out's great although it's a massive headache and I will say that on camera. It's a bigger headache than any of you can imagine. Logistical stuff, councils, noise police, health and safety, fire risks, and generally the man not wanting you to have a good party, innit. Yeah the chopper scene at the Trip Out is... this is what people would have done in the 60s and 70s. They had the chops and during the whole era of build what you've got and people were doing Triumphs, they were doing Harleys, whatever they could get hold of. That's what you see here. It's not all about the shine and the sheen, it's about what gets you down the road so everything's purpose built and that's what I like about it. Well we bought a mini-bike and we were sitting there not doing anything on it, eating breakfast, and we said yeah we should build a mini-bike, got a picture up like a Taco, 60s mini-bike, 3-speed with reverse, so 4-speed I suppose, wheel barrow wheels, with a CG125 rear sprocket. Got a show field pass, and we're going to try and do the chop slalom if it's still on. It's a bit wet so the tyre compound's not really ideal on it. But if we can enter it, we will. Everybody wants to come to Dirtquake. It's the coolest go fast event. I've heard all sorts of whacky and weird rumours about it all but I'm here now and yeah, looking forward to it. I'm weird and whacky so why not get involved? It's a dirt track race mainly for people who may not have raced dirt track before, to give them a taste. It's not professional racers, it's amateurs and some of them are very amateur and some of the amateurs are quite professional but no-one's here for the money, no-one really cares who wins or loses, the spectators don't know who wins or loses. The only guy who cares who wins is the guy who won and the guy who came second, he would have liked to win. No-one else cares. You don't need a race bike, you don't need any experience. You turn up and race. It's just something a bit different, it's not racing showroom motorbikes that are all the bloody same, that all make the same noise. It's a celebration of happiness first of all and I think, happiness on two wheels so it's a way to introduce people and tell them that that's fun, it's not that dangerous, it's friendly, and you don't need to have a $30k bike to have fun. So this bike my friends bought, oh look it's a number 1. My friends bought this on eBay for Â£11 and handed it to me and were like 'you wanna race it?' and I'm like 'sure'. At Dirtquake, I saw a lot of messing around but not a lot of bad crashes 'cause I think it's a great start from somebody who wants to get into flat track. Go to Dirtquake, you can take any bike. You can go back to work on Monday and say 'l raced my motorbike this weekend' and you really raced it. I like being able to tell people I'm a motorcycle racer. Whatever my results are. When I first started riding motorbikes, there were no other women. I didn't know anybody that rode a motorbike that was another woman. There is no getting around the fact that it was boys club and the women who had been riding 20 years before me, they experienced it ten fold. Yeah very sexist, misogynist, very... the club culture of like... women are property and they never ride, they're never part of anything, they don't own anything. It's horrendous actually. Women still get a hard time, you know, as a girl pulls up on a bike, it's a big bike, guys are like 'oh is she going to drop it?' but you know what, I think this scene in particular is supportive of women riders. The coolest thing I've noticed about this show in particular is there's more female bike builders here as well. So it's not just riders and girls like us that make clothes but girls that are wrenching and building their own bikes and showing them. And that's really inspiring to me. People don't really care too much about my gender. They care more about the product, but for me, my gender, I've had a very lucky experience and I know a lot of women who have not. And I empathise with that and I also am trying to help change that the way that they're trying to change it and men are following suit. Men are participating in this social change just as hard as the women are. I feel like they're helping because they realise that it's important. It's a far more inclusive market. It's far more, both female friendly and I think to a certain extent, family friendly. And what's amazing is that the bike media, the traditional bike media, doesn't seem to have noticed. I see way more women on the road, I see more riding groups pop up and I see a lot on social media which is great That's where a lot of people are connecting and we encourage people to connect. There's a big buzz word all over now about feminism and women doing it for themselves and I think motorcycling has just maybe become a part of that. I think it's a good timing thing with the custom scene coming to the fore and then it happening around the same time as a lot of other things in women's lives. We have the potential to change the industry for the better. Women are fitting in in a different way. They're exposed directly to stories about other strong women who are coming up on their own and doing this. But right now you're dealing with a lot of women who are best known for Insta-fame and that's dangerous. They're riding, they're racing, they're doing really interesting things but it's really easy to write them off Looking at some of the more trendy Instagram photos and things for women in motorcycling that are happening right now, you can look at it as an extrapolation of old Easy Riders in a negative way, or you can look at it in a positive way because they're not draped on the bike not moving, they're riding it themselves. It's a fine line to get a woman on a motorcycle to empower her as well as the machine. And I think a lot of my fellow photographers actually fallen down on that whereas being a woman and shooting women, has actually been a lot easier for me than it maybe would be for one of my colleagues, men colleagues that is. It's more about women opening up motorcycle riding to other women right now and the community that I've met through that is just amazing. We did not mean to start Babes Ride Out at all. Well, Anya and I had been friends for a little while, and we wanted to go camping together and then we decided to open it up to everyone, all women, so we posted a really shitty Instagram flyer and before you knew it, we were getting messages from girls all over the United States. It just grew exponentially as we used social media to reach out and tried to meet these ladies. It just creates this safety bubble. No-one's cooler than the next person. We're all the same this one weekend. You'll see a 60 year-old grandma hanging out with a 21 year-old girl. They're having a beer together and talking about where they ride, who they are, what they do. The idea of teaching women how to ride or at least giving them their first go on a bike. Me and the girls got together and said, well our boyfriends taught us to ride in Asda car parks. What do girls do if they don't have a friend or a boyfriend that just has a little bike that they can give it a go on but they really want to get into it. My thought was, create a network that's based in something deeper than Instagram, hashtags, and a t-shirt you can buy for $10 and actually connect these women so yeah we look like we're having a blast on social media but it's so much deeper. It's truly a network. With the younger generation maybe, of motorcyclist, it's a little bit less like you're a female motorcyclist, you're a male motorcyclist, we're all just motorcyclists. The distinction is not so important any more which I think is really cool. There's many times in my life when I've asked myself the same question 'why do I build custom bikes?' because I'm definitely not rich and I've struggled most of my life to pay the rent. Just be real, why do we customise anything? We like to show off. I don't play golf, my father plays golf and I said â€˜why the fuck do you like playing golf?' and he said 'it's the game that you can't play perfectly but it's that trying to do something perfect'. I'm like 'that's the dumbest thing I've ever fucking heard'. - Son what do you do? â€”- I build these bikes. - You built a perfect one yet? - No - You think you can? - No It's kind of like playing golf, you think you're going to get perfect. You're not. I was the kid on my block that took everybody's bicycles apart and maybe didn't get them all back together all the time so their parents were always yelling at my parents. But that passion for how things worked, is what drove me. I have this disease of making, I want to make stuff but I've never been happier since I've been making stuff. So... The whole time you're working on these bikes, you can't wait until it's done. But then the minute it's done, it's done. Now what? You start another one. You know what? I love making things and motorcycles are just my favourite. I like cars but it's just it's a little too much for me and you spend years building a car and a motorcycle, you can get it out, you can get all your creative visions out and to me it's just as cool. All the skills and craft, all the engineering, and then also getting the aesthetic and artistry built into it, is such a fun process for me. That's why I think it's a worthwhile pursuit, even though it is just a frivolous thing, it's just a silly motorcycle but that combination makes it more than that. To me, I'm a caretaker of that bike. It belonged to somebody before and it'll belong to somebody after me. I'm taking and making it into something new and different. I don't want to be remembered personally but I want the brand to be remembered and to be thought of inside the motorcycling timeline as... we helped this thing. I want to leave a little something of me for later when I will not be there any more, maybe for my son and daughter. If he can have a little head turner, paragraph in the custom story I'm happy, I win. I don't feel like I have a choice because as soon as one is finished there's this nagging, creeping feeling that there's something new to be solved or something new to be looked at. There's new questions that have arrived. It's a disease, isn't it? It's like I either have to stop what I'm doing right now or I need to go all the way into it because you can't get into this a little bit, you have to do it 100% I was helping a friend of mine, Josh Elison, who's a great metal shaper. He came and looked at my bike. He's like 'wow that's fucking great'. I looked at his and I'm like â€˜yours is way better than mine' He's like â€˜no yours'. Then we start pointing out to each other 'no look where I fucked this up' 'no, my fuck up is bigger than yours' It's like, what are we doing? In the motorcycle world, we're all competitive. Like with Woolie, Woolie built a beautiful MV Agusta and I'm working on an MV Agusta right now. I love the bike that he built, I think it's gorgeous. So I'm here trying to do something a bit different with our MV but it's competitive. I want to build a better bike than Woolie built. Fuck yeah, I do! I respect the hell out of him but at the same time I want to build a better bike than he built. On the builder side, competition is never overly welcome. It's not just the competition for customers but it's the competition of ideas and protection of ideas so it all gets a little touchy. What would motorcycles be without a little beef now and again, right? But it just goes viral a lot faster now because of Instagram. I shudder a little bit. I'm probably not going to win any friends here but I shudder a little bit when I see bikes like [BLEEP] or [BLEEP], basically just bikes that had a few little things unbolted and a lick of paint and put back together again and they're probably really nice guys and they probably worked really hard to earn that money but you can't call that a custom. Everyone used to build a bike, take it to a show, put it on a plinth, and that was it. You just show off what you built. And no-one would ride the bike. Most of us are building custom bikes to race at a show now instead of building a show bike you're building a show bike that's for a flat track race or for a drag race or for a hill climb. So Glemseck 101, this event we are attending now is hosting the finals of Sultans Of Sprint sprint racing challenge. What makes me really, really happy and proud is that we manage to build up a kind of therapy for motorcycle freaks. What we're doing is, we call it turbo charged flying carpet contest. Yeah I think really what makes Sultans Of Sprint really, really special is it's something in between custom bikes and racing bikes. It's, for me, quite fascinating. It's all the energy they put on working on the bikes to make them faster. For a six second adrenaline shot, you know. It's completely completely crazy. I mean, it's pushing custom to new boundaries. The economics of building bikes have meant that some people have excelled and other people have fallen by the wayside because it's not really a good way to make money unless you're very, very organised or very talented. You've either got to create a brand that people will pay money for or a product that people feel is value for money. It keeps going because people are so passionate about it and for them, making money wasn't what got them into it in the first place. And for them, all they really want is a way to keep doing it. I'm in business to make money obviously I'm only concerned with having enough feed those kids and go back tomorrow. Everybody I know in the bike building world that has a bike building company, struggles. I don't know, maybe other people are getting rich doing it but I don't feel like I am. The enemy of the builder is the time. It's always the time. I don't know, working for ten hours, charging for one or two, there's just nothing in it and if they were all brutally honest, it's probably only a Â£1 or Â£2 an hour. A lot of people enter the custom bike world with a passion which you need, but they get taken advantage of. People get them to build bikes, they don't pay them what it costs the person to build the bike, but they try to get it on the cheap. Take advantage of that person's passion. If somebody tries to sell a bike for $40,000, it's a lot of money but you've got $25,000 worth of parts in that bike. If it took that guy six months to build that bike, he made $15,000 in six months. If you're building a bike and you start from scratch every time, then hope to find a client who will buy it, you'll go broke. So we launched a concept for a batch build, and the bikes were a success, but we didn't really sell any. You can build what you think is the greatest bike in the world, and you've got 1,000 hours in it, and nobody likes it so if you get it on a commission, and you build it for them and as you go, he's paying and so forth, he's never happy. You never get to the end of that job. You can't make a living out of that. But it would be very easy to be seduced by Instagram and things to think that there's a living to be made easily in the custom bike scene. And then you have the business people who figure out how to sell swag and parts and things like that. I mean, Roland Sands is like the apex guy. The big thing for me is I'm not down there working on bikes all day. A lot of what I do is convince people to spend money with us. I look at it as a business. I don't look at it like I need to do this entire project on my own, in order to make it authentic. And then when you try to put the numbers in, and start to put the business model together, and start to actually figure out what's the economics of how this works? You find out that there's no data to go on, there's no real tangible information so you've got to make stuff up and then you go, 'well this is all bullshit' The custom motorcycle thing is cool and it's great and it is a business but to be successful at it, we all have to do something else. Our parts line is what actually brings in the steady income on a regular basis. We build a bike, it gets a lot of press, it gets a lot of media attention, and then they come to our website to check us out and hopefully they leave buying a tail light or a hat and that's basically the business model. People that I don't want to deal with is cheap, cheap people that want to nickel and dime on each project. How much is this? How much is that? How much is this? It's hard to deal with people that don't understand what it takes to be a craftsman. I don't have a millionaire coming up to me, wanting me to build a $50,000 bike. I've got blue collar dudes, a guy that has saved a couple of bucks, he's got three kids at home, and he's wanting to spend $12,000 on a really cool bike. So I want to make sure he's getting something really cool for his money. I mean, these are luxury goods. Nobody needs a motorcycle. Certainly nobody needs a custom motorcycle so my client is the higher crest of the 1% of the world. I need movie star customers with bigger pockets. Our average customer has changed quite dramatically. We've gone from blue collar guys to building bikes for millionaires. My day job is my day job. I like doing this stuff, I don't want to make this my work, I need that balance of reality and this little fun fucking motorcycle shit that we do. I don't make money doing this, customers are a pain in the ass. Sometimes it's pretty hard when a guy has been thinking about his bike for the last year and he's got all these ideas on paper and he's got everything that he wants together and then you've got to burst his bubble because then he can't afford what he wants. The first question: What does it cost? And I say, well it can cost $700 or $70,000. What do you want to spend? The prices, I keep it pretty simple. I just think about how much time is involved and how expensive it's going to be. I can build a bike for $20,000 or $100,000. There's no... there's no set thing. I don't have a minimum price. Right now they start at around 18 and go up to about 40. And honestly it's like surprising how easy it is to spend $35,000 on a $35,000 bike. They end up going into personal collections and that's really what I can say about it. The level of collector has to be consistent with the build and I've just been really fortunate that I've aligned with people that get what I do. Yeah Mama Tried is very unique. You can go flat track racing on Friday and go to a show on Saturday, and on Sunday you can go ice racing so to have a flat track race in an NBA stadium is pretty spectacular. We're really into dirt tracking, flat tracking around here, that's a big sport in this area. So we were like â€˜how can we do an indoor race?' so we thought of the coke syrup thing and that's how it started. We knew the Hooligan thing was happening. I got in touch with Aaron Guardado and I was like, â€˜so what's the deal with Hooligan? Is there rules?' And he's like, 'no not really, it's really just dirt ball outlaw racing, for people who just want to get into the sport'. And I was like, 'alright let's have it'. It definitely started out as... show up at the track and race your Harley no matter what it is. Your street Harley slowly evolves into a race Harley and next thing you know you've got yourself a full blown race bike. What's good about the Hooligan class is that it's a really attainable form of racing. Your regular Joe can go out and race and potentially win everything on a pretty small budget which is really nice. And you can have a complete race bike for under $5,000 which is crazy. You can't have anything competitive in any other racing on that minimal budget. It's great because it's bringing a ton of new people into the sport. A ton. I think Sideburn was hugely influential on re-exporting dirt track back to the USA and getting people interested in it again. Dirt track racing is: you throw a bike in the back of your pick up truck and your leathers and you go racing and that's what's cool about it. Summers are crazy around here because everyone only gets four or five months to ride. So in the winter everyone is like always messing with their stuff because you can't ride but you're thinking about motorcycles every day. We just thought, what a better way to do it, like have that stoke in the middle of winter. A little bit of something in the deepest part of winter to get you through until summertime. The bikes that we chose, maybe they're not the best of any genre that they're in, I mean some of them are, it still fucking rules. It doesn't matter that it's not perfect. The person that was building that bike had an idea what they wanted, they went after it and didn't care what other people thought. We came to Mama Tried show, we got invited while we were at Sturgis. That was a boost of confidence while we were at Sturgis. It sucks. Nobody got our bike whatsoever. A lot of old people with golf carts and shit and then we got the call to come to Mama Tried. I think it's a cool thing. And I think that's had a lot to do with why these little grass roots shows can become huge but still stay cool and relevant and not a total sell-out. We're all into two wheels. There's so many different genres and things you can fit it when it comes to two wheels. I want them all in the same room. I want to split up all their groups so I don't put a big pile of choppers in the corner so all the chopper kids can go make a dark corner and hang out and talk shit on everybody because they're too cool to talk to anybody else. I want to take them out of their comfort zone, put them next to a race guy and I want to see one of those chopper guys on a race bike at Flat Out Friday the next year. They can hate 95% of the bikes but they'll love one. Or vice versa. Some of those bikes I'm... I don't like them. But I know that they're going to like them and when I go out there, right now, and that sun's just like that and I see the bike that I don't like, gleaming in the sun and there's people all around it that are just loving it, What do you say? It's perfect. It's great. I feel like we lucked out and did something at a really perfect time in what's happening with motorcycling. Maybe it'll be like this for a long time or maybe it's just a little space in time but it's cool to be around it while it's here. Winter time changes between ice riding and building. It's a labour of love at the end of the day. Building these bikes is something I can do to get away from life. It's something I can do to just relax. It truly is fun and it allows my imagination to go wild. I think that would be difficult today, to start up and do something that hasn't already been done. We made it legit to do whatever you want because we didn't follow any kind of rules. I was the only guy who was a racer who was building custom bikes. It was this crazy blend, like taking those two things and smashing them together was the most natural thing in the world to do. What I wanted the company to be, what the inspiration was for the company it was the English street biker scene. For a kid coming up in the sport bike community, to see... here's your sport bike, but this is what it could be turned into, and it was mind-blowing to me. The custom bikes that get built now often begin with a collaboration going through photos of examples of bikes that someone has seen on social media. Custom builders get really edgy if you claim that it was your bike where they got the idea. Every custom builder came up with every idea they've ever had on any bike they've ever built and I'd be the last person to suggest otherwise. You have to obey the laws of physics, you can break the laws of man all you want, but the laws of physics are not bendable so you have to find a way to work within them. Building a good custom bike, to make it look good in the metal and actually physically work as a piece of transport, is fiendishly hard. Taking things that don't work and making them work and connecting those lines, it always inspires thought. It makes people think. It's not just 'hey look at this custom bike! it's an idea. To me, less is more so when you look at the bikes that I do, they almost look like they wouldn't work. I guess it's a simple process that's difficult to do, if that makes sense. This is a bike I'm doing for the Show Class People's Champ. It's for the Born Free show this year up in California. I basically modified the frame how I wanted it to look. I actually built the bike around the tank. So I built this tank a few years ago and it's been sitting on my shelf and I've been waiting to use it. There is going to be straight bars that are clean. There's going to be no controls on them with an internal throttle. It'll just look like a nice clean little short chop but it's a soft tail. That's basically the gist of what this one's going to look like. Don't do design for the sake of design because that's not design. You're not solving any problems, you're creating a problem by doing that. I think it goes back to the simplicity of the design so anything that is simple and elegant it will be more or less timeless. As soon as you add more than what should be there, it can date quite quickly. A component or a complete machine, whatever it is, designed to perform properly, at its best possible way, it automatically somehow becomes a beautiful object, in this case a motorcycle, inherently it's beautiful. Honestly, I'll block an engine up against a wall, move tyres back and forth, and get the wheel base things down to where I'm starting to feel it, and then I'll take pictures of it and I'll just sketch on the pictures with a pencil. So every time it needs a part designed, I do it in Solid Works. I design every part myself. I'm a designer from the first through to the end. Recently, I had the opportunity to build a bike with my own aesthetic. From that, it kind of opened up this huge door to make me want to come to work and create art that happens to be on a motorcycle. Typically I like to try and get as much creative freedom as possible but some customers just want to have some say. That definitely disrupts the creative process. So we try to do a couple of spec builds a year where we just build what we want and sell. Customers obviously bring in money so we try to do a few of those as well. Some are great and some not so great. There are times that people come in and they say: Hey I saw this bike on Bike EXIF or Bike Shed or Pipeburn and it's like: I want you to make me this bike. It's like, no. Somebody else made that bike. That's their bike. I'm not going to make that bike. Or they ask us to repeat what we already made that they saw on Bike EXIF. I'm like: No I don't want to do that, that's no fun. I negotiate for white card every time. We discuss, I try to know who is in front of me and we try to know what are his hobbies his passions, what he likes really. And I will do what he wants not what he asks. There's a bit of a difference. All you need is *that*. Remember that. All you need is *that*. But you can have as much of that as you want but it don't give you style though. *That* don't buy taste, does it! It's really interesting to see nowadays if you go to a show like Yokohama Mooneyes. There's so many incredible builds there that... a lot of people actually say that the best customised Harleys come from Japan. What blew me away about that bike was that... the way he just so effortlessly encapsulated everything in one bike. It was like, woah! And then he goes back to building a chopper or something. With builders at the top of their game, the skill set is kind of more than the style. One of the most interesting characters is lan Barry of Falcon Motorcycles. He made 3 or 4 of the most beautiful custom bikes ever, selling for insane amounts of money. I like the word friction. Friction is responsible for the conversion of energy so to not embrace seemingly conflicting ideas and trying to hold them in the same container as long as you can, engineering and art, whatever the two are, they're always there but that friction is necessary and I play with that. I swim in it. I antagonise it. It's really difficult to create a signature style. But then you get people like Autofabrica and they've managed to get that kind of signature look and they do it beautifully. We've got DNA that we've developed from very early on so it's very easy for us to apply that same principle that same formula to anything that we build and designing a bike that doesn't conform to a trend but almost gives a nod to whatever design era you want that bike to be applicable for and having a modern take on it. We're not constrained by other people telling us what to do or how to design something. We just come up with an idea and just put it in metal. The brand, the business, our skill sets have all evolved and it's gone from being a custom bikes shop to coach builders. Our skill sets lend us to coach building a motorcycle. So the Type 11 project with Yamaha, I feel like we've captured a modern take on a cafÃ© racer, dare I say it. I think every designer's dream is to create concepts and not water them down and what we like to think is that we've created that but we have got real world constraints as well. One of the most important things is the marriage of form and function. I like to have something aesthetically pleasing but it has to work too and perform the function so there's often that compromise, the left and right side of the brain, which is like turmoil. Your brain is fighting with itself. As an engineer, the thing that I really enjoy is when someone says â€˜you can't do that'. Fuck you, I'm going to do it! When it's not supposed to work or be that way, And you can find a way to get it all to balance out and all to be aesthetic, all to still function. I want somebody to be able to ride around Europe or America on our bikes but if somebody else wants to do a show bike, they may be showing their skills off rather than talking about a bike that's rideable. It's just saying â€˜this is a piece of art'. Custom bikes are as rideable as the builder wants them to be. The first thing is, they all have to work so I ride them all. They all work. Even if it's going in a museum, that's a given. Every part on a bike has got to work perfectly. I want my bikes to be ridden as hard as possible and that's typically what I tell my clients. I put several hundred miles on your bike before I gave it to you and now I want you to ride the piss out of it. I can think of nothing worse than just to sit and look at it. I'm flattered and also insulted, simultaneously. A bike has to have its look, its image, but I think that a bike that's not ridden is defeating its purpose for being. At this point, I would like to create machines that are less of a motorcycle for people to ride and more of a kinetic art piece. Fun to create and also fun for the viewer to figure out how it works and spark the curiosity â€˜cause my entire existence in this culture is revolving around my curiosity of how things work. A lot of custom bikes back in the day were artistic rather than functional I think. There's an old thing though, if it looks right it usually is right. Form following function and everything and yeah the market has changed. For the better. I guess. I think that putting anything in a museum changes how people look at it. I see no distinction between art and engineering. You can make pure art without engineering but anything that has to do with construction has engineering involved. This is perhaps the art of engineering. Or the engineering of art! They're intimately entwined. The Custom Revolution exhibition is an exhibit of 24 motorcycles from around the world. A remarkably diverse collection. Peak examples of a renaissance that's happened in motorcycle culture in the last 10 years. I was asked by the Petersen Museum if I was interested in helping them put together a show so it was amazing to bring all that stuff into an actual museum. There's been a lot of shows but there's never been a museum show featuring this scene and it doesn't represent any particular style but it does represent a movement and a cultural moment. I've been calling this a renaissance in motorcycle culture the likes of which we haven't seen since the 70s. So in this instance, I'm hoping that framing them within a museum will make people think a little bit differently about what's happening with motorcycles. They're eccentric, each one is unique, but they're design objects. They all needed to be special so I thought 'we need wow bikes". So what connects all these motorcycles is a purity of vision and intention but mostly it's the success of how they've realised their ideas. These trends will go away but the style remains. It's one of the first times that I've been aware in the motor industry where manufacturers have actually listened to what people want. Before, it was 'this is what you need', this is what you must have' Now it's 'shit we've got to work out what you guys want otherwise you're going to buy the other man's one.' If you look at Yamaha, BMW, Triumph, Moto Guzzi, they are actively courting the custom scene. If it wouldn't have been for this whole scene, I think we would never have made a Nine T for example. But when we started seeing the shift towards these kind of bikes, then you saw this whole new wave custom scene, that triggered us to start working on a bike like that on our own. We saw that there's definitely an audience out there We are more or less 30% of the total sales of the company. Until now, we sold something like 46,000 bikes. We've always been in the custom scene, from the very beginning. Some of our first parts and accessories date back to the early 1900s. So within just a few years of the company coming alive, there was ways to make the motorcycle different, custom. When you buy a Harley, it's basically the down payment and then people load it up with all the accessories. I think that's part of the reason Harley is so successful. Because you're buying a factory bike, but then you can spend another $15,000 on trinkets. Triumph has just noticed that. They now do the Bobber, they'll be 150 accessories for it. So that's their approach to the custom scene. I was working on a bike in the background and I wanted to do a series, I contacted Triumph France to get some bikes. They told me no, we don't give you bikes because we have our own package to custom the bikes directly in the shop, in the Triumph shop. That's not custom, of course, it's accessories. I've just bought a new van, I went to the showroom and I specced my van out. I could say I've got a custom van because I've got this, that and the other on it but it's not a bloody custom is it? If the scene is offered to you on a plate, and the manufacturer says 'here's the bike, here's the helmet here's the jacket, go off, live your own dream.' If you want to buy into that, fantastic. When a movement gains speed, larger companies will want to try and capitalise on that movement because there's going to be people who literally can't afford artisan, one-off produced motorcycles 'cause they cost a lot of money so if you can buy a custom bike for Â£10k, then that's brilliant. I think it depends on whether they're doing it as tokenism, or whether they're doing it in some way that they actually believe in it. Some brands do it very well, but others just pretend to do it. That's not what this is all about for me and people like me. It's not what it's about. Nice things to look at but there's no heart and there's no soul. The real hardcore guys that will build bikes, they always stay below the radar and they're building their own bikes and they don't give a shit what the brands do. It has to be one person, with one vision, working on a concept. It's not a corporation that says a custom bike should look like X,Y,Z. Oh we're going to make 10,000 of them. Or even 10 of them. It's a one off. It's the line between true life and lifestyle and true community and corporate. Essentially, what the manufacturers are doing are using us to sell bikes. Custom bikes that have been funded by manufacturers to appeal to an audience... Is that marketing gone mad or does it defy what it actually means to have a custom bike? A perfect example of that is a manufacturer making a Bobber. When you think about that... So that Bobber's possibly the worst bike I've ever seen in my life. It's just the front half of the Bonneville with no thought applied to the rear end of it and the one thing that really fucks me off about companies like that is, change the name of bikes. Don't call a bike a Bobber because that is a style of bike. And now if you Google Triumph Bobber, their fucking bike comes up and you wanna see Triumph Bobbers. I don't think it comes through as genuine to people in these sub-cultures. I think they feel like it's a money grab and it turns a lot of people off because we all got into this because it was something different. You don't want to be in a parking lot with 50 of the same bike. You want yours to stand out, you want it to be yours. It's really easy if you are in a scene that's really quite niche and quite cool to get quite uppity when other people start coming along and going 'l'll have a piece of that'. And the manufacturers come on board then the brands come on board. And this scene, the secret of its continued survival is evolution. And to keep moving and the manufacturers coming on board is part of that evolution. We should embrace it. But I think it's important for manufacturers to understand a new blood that is getting into the industry and it going to take us forward. We know that we need to stay away but be part of it without being too... Now the manufacturers are taking note of this and seeing what an appetite there is for custom bikes that they're starting to do it themselves. Commercially, that's very sensible, but there's still always going to be that appetite for there only being one. You'll never see another one like it. That's pretty powerful. The custom motorcycle scene has totally revolutionised the motorcycle industry. The motorcycle industry was in the doldrums and sales were way down, and there is no enthusiasm and new ridership is way down. It's a sign that there's a big problem in the industry. So the custom scene has been a life force. It's injected new life into the motorcycle industry and that's really exciting. What a cool place to be, to be changing the direction of a many billion dollar global industry. We have this official customisation programme. We work with builders around the world. It's one of the ways in which we can both support and encourage the custom ecosystem that way. Within India, Royal Enfield has been the most customised motorcycle for a very long time. The world of customisation allows us to maybe be seen by people who wouldn't necessarily have considered our brand. There's a lot more to Royal Enfield and by doing these customs, we can hopefully broaden people's perception of what that is. So the Sinroja brothers were an interesting coming together of things quite accidentally. Rahul and Birju are Indian brothers, Indian company, everybody's living in Leicester... I love the story about the fact that we were Indians, we grew up with these bikes, we grew up in India, we were set free to do whatever we want as long as it was a cool idea, they were always on board. It was more like friends just handing out building bikes rather than a corporate giant saying 'here's a bit of money, do that, I'll see you in two months time." Basically, we were approached by Adrian from Royal Enfield saying would I be interested in working with them and we would be getting the Interceptor to work on and obviously we jumped at the opportunity. The guys at Royal Enfield have got an amazing team. I'm not being paid to say this, but they're all genuinely enthusiastic and interested in motorcycles. We don't place a strong limitation of any sort on the builder. For us, we have our motor, there in the bike. That's the core of that bike, it's the motor. Just keep some of the character but we're not going to tell you to limit your creative vision because of some idea that makes a difference because it doesn't in the end. Motorcycles are cool. The cooler the motorcycle, the more people will like it. Please make us a cool motorcycle. With in house builds like Lock Stock, those are where we want to really push the capability of the bikes to the next level. This is why we bring in Harris, because they are chassis masters. This has been great, yeah it's been really good. It's created a lot of interest within our factory because we haven't done a drag race before so, perhaps I shouldn't say this, I think it's come out pretty well so we're all quite proud of it. This was a competition/custom bike so it needed to look nice as well. In terms of creativity, El Solitario of Spain, they're in a different league. They march to the beat of a different drum. They make truly amazing machines, really controversial, We have a voice in the motorcycle world and for good or for bad, but at least we have the right to choose who we work with and with that voice, we decide how we use it. So we realised we were strong at communicating and working with others so that's how the Desert Wolves were born. When we first started talking about Desert Wolves, everything seemed so complicated. We were so excited, we couldn't believe we were going to make such a dream project. It was too beautiful to be true and too difficult to be possible, it seemed to us. And one thing we love at El Solitario is jumping into the void. When we start a project, we have to be loyal to ourselves and to what El Solitario is, and brands want to work with us, it's because they like what we do. The motto of the Desert Wolves was collaboration. It was the central axis of the adventure. We wanted to do absolutely everything, from the helmets to the bags, to the tents, to the motorcycles When David from El Solitario approached us for his Desert Wolves project, he was looking for a very cool looking fabric so we wanted to develop a comfortable, lightweight, protective denim that even passes the CE standard. We had been flirting for a while with El Solitario. He approached us to say 'we're trying to do a project which is trying to show a more adventurous side of a motorcycle and we think it should be a Harley'. I said 'OK let's do an adventure'. Of course, it's El Solitario so there's a high level of abnormality. We're going to go to somewhere impossible with an impossible motorcycle and impossible clothes but it's going to work. Let's leave Western civilisation and get into the sands of the Sahara. We like their attitude because they're that embodiment rider, the hooligan approach to Dakar riding. Imagine for Harley Davidson to develop a scrambler programme make it real, that would cost millions. So we're actually a very economic way of exploring future options. [MUSIC PLAYS IN BACKGROUND] We've been really amazed at how well the bikes were performing in the rocky terrain, harsh conditions, warm temperatures, and we also know they're pretty rough riders so they were giving the bikes a good beating but there were no major issues, that was a good sign of confidence as well in our bikes. [MUSIC PLAYS IN BACKGROUND] We road them home, that's unbelievable, I mean all the shit we went through, yeah they survived. It was hard, it was fucking hard, It was a huge adventure, a real one. It was a fucking real one. And we survived ten days in the desert. I never enjoy the victories when they happen, I enjoy the victories afterwards, in the aftermath. And even after a war, I can't, I just don't see it happening. I need some... relax to be like, fuck, we did it. Things can only really be sharp and on the edge and cool when they're small. As soon as it gets too big, it's too diluted, it's just not fresh any more and that happens with everything. So yeah, the bigger it gets, the blunter it gets, I guess. I think that the great shame in any phenomenon is when it gets rooted in itself. You can disappear up your own arse in a puff of niche smoke if you're not careful. You've got to evolve. Because it can't stand still. If it stands still, it will die, which it nearly did in 2008. Have we crested the wave? Are we on the back side of the wave? Or the front side? I'm really intrigued with how things will change but they will change. As long as there's motorcycles on the road, there'll be custom motorcycles. And I think the scene will adapt and change through different kinds of trends. Like many other things, social media has opened the window on any niche worldwide and there's guys interested. I thought it was going to do like a fucking souffle. The only risk is if it goes too much, we lose the spirit, the philosophy. It is tricky because I feel the same way. I get scared. The bigger it gets, the bigger it's going to eat itself. If something's really good, then everybody likes it, and it gets bigger and bigger, and then becomes this great big snowball careering out of control. The internet speeds up evolution too quickly and we should've been allowed to have 10 or 15 years before it got bitten into by the big corporate companies and then it becomes generic and they white wash it all and it becomes a pastiche of itself. You say people buy cheap motorcycles and fix them up but I don't see that nearly as much as I see people buying $10,000 motorcycles on a credit card and you see it at things like Babes Ride Out. 90% of people are on a Triumph Bonneville or a Harley 883. They're not on anything other than that. So it's a new world in that way. It's not a sub-culture any more though is it? If you want to keep something super niche and to yourself, fuck off and do it on your own. People who are opening a restaurant or a cafe, think about opening a motorcycle cafe. Anybody who's got a garage and a blow torch is now a custom bike builder. You have to remember, that to build one, it's a tremendous amount of time and cost for someone goes into that so I think there will only ever be a certain audience for whom they have the capacity to undertake those kinds of projects, either as the consumer or the builder. We don't want to be part of the mainstream like everyone else and as soon as this custom motorcycle scene that we've all been part of and loved since we were Kids, becomes the cool thing, I think we're probably going to shun it. Not motorcycles themselves, 'cause I'm always going to ride a motorbike and I'm always going to work on my own bikes and build my own bikes, and so are my friends. For me, I'm just going to be in my workshop, drinking beers and working on bikes really. I don't give a shit where the scene goes. I'm not too worried about where it goes or how it goes or how it gets there. Seeing what everyone else is doing and pushing yourself away while adding and pushing forward into something else, is constantly racing away from that tsunami of mass culture, I guess. Lots of people we know who are very famous have become quite quiet. We used to notice they're very hard at work and they've stepped back and are thinking about what they're doing and we've seen this year bike builders drop out and close their doors. I think everyone's starting think, well where we going next? What's coming next? What are we going to do? How's this going to evolve, grow and keep on going? And it will, but it's just how it's going to happen. Personally, I don't have any option. I don't have any training or qualifications in any other direction. I don't have any fall back, there is no pension, there is no whatever, social security. Nothing. So there's just doing it forever. There is no plan. Let's be honest, the combustion engine is not going to be around for that long so let's enjoy it while we've got what we've got and then when the next thing comes along, let's make that great and the people who do adapt are going to be the ones who will always be the trend setters, or the ones who come up with exciting new ideas and I'd like to be one of them. I'd love to get my hands on an electric bike and try customising an electric bike because I definitely think that electric bikes are very close to being where we're headed. Once you are understanding that today, the guy who lives in Santa Monica is connected to the guy that lives in Milan, and the guy who lives in Jakarta, and understand that the problems we have right now facing us, they're all the same. Then electric bikes or alternative vehicles, as we call them, make a lot of sense. Electric bikes are here and they're viable and they're a lot of fun to ride because they have 100% torque at ORPM. That's a recipe for Yee ha! I would like to see more customisers embrace electric bikes and think about other things. Try something new. If you're taking this much time and energy into it, let's make a real impact on the industry and not just a style impact, maybe there's room for an engineering impact too. To be honest, I'm quite intrigued with electric vehicles. I've been studying them a little while now and they do interest me. The silent revolution... and it's going to sneak up on us and we're not going to be aware of it but it's going to suddenly take over and I'm all for it. I think it's great. That means we can ride stealth and we can ride free without having the Cops On our ass. You're going to go to jail if they catch you with a motorcycle in the forest but on an electric one, they can't catch you because they can't hear you. It's kind of the shitty thing about human beings, right. The know change is necessary but you give them ten steps of how to change things and they're all painful things to address, nobody is going to fucking do it. So if you give them something that's easy and understandable and exciting, then change is imminent, you know. We have all these manufacturers building bikes, watching people lose riding spaces, watching people lose access to tracks, and nobody's doing anything about it. But they're iterating on technology to the tiniest percentage to sell you a new bike, but they're not addressing the need for an electric power train or a quiet bike or the ability to reconfigure your investment in a way that makes it sustainable or OK for the modern world. Sooner or later there's going to be a mainstream electric motorbike that's going to have all the boxes ticked and everyone will be like 'yves, I get it now, makes sense, I want one of those!" It may not replace their garage full of stinky two strokes but if it can stand on its own two wheels... Anyway, you want to be future-proof, in a way as well. It's interesting if you look at a product that we've done like Live Wire, which is our first electric Harley. If you have the opportunity to ride a Live Wire, you'll have a blast. It's good fun to ride, very futuristic and it does add to the emotional experience on the bike. The only thing restricting electric bikes at the moment is the stigma attached to it. There's a new technology there. The world's changing and you can embrace that or not, but those that embrace it will be producing some fantastic bikes that won't have an internal combustion engine. The biggest thing was the potential behind them. What can we build here? We don't have to adhere by any of the things that we have to worry about. I can chuck away the rule book. I don't have to worry about exhausts, heat, vibration, fuel, oil, nothing. It's a really interesting prospect and that's what I'm looking forward to from a customising point of view. Right now, this question of what is next, the notion of a true motorcycle for the 21st century, which I haven't seen, which doesn't exist. And I want to be there to see it, to ride it, and maybe even to make it and that's a real powerful idea and something that... my hair just stood on end thinking about it. [MUSIC PLAYS IN BACKGROUND]
