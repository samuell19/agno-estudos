Who are you? We're with the opera troupe. Oh, I didn't recognize you! I'm a great fan of you both. Is that so? Thank you. It's been over twenty years since you performed together, hasn't it? Twenty-one. Twenty-two. Yes, twenty-two years. And it's been ten years since we last saw each other. Eleven. Eleven years. that's right, eleven years. Yes. It's due to the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution. Right! Yeah, that's right. Things are better now. that's for sure. Everything's fine now. Please, wait here a moment. I'll go turn on the lights. Sorry to trouble you. Yanhong, is that you? I've really missed you. Whore! Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the show! You, cunning asshole! Laizi is trying to run away again. Brat! See how far you get! Quick, go catch him! I'm sorry. Gentlemen, please be patient. Trash ! how dare you show yourselves around here? Fuck you all ! Just as sure as my name is Shitou. . . I'll give you something to look at. What are you screaming for? I haven't even said hello yet! You're a disgrace to the opera troupe. You couldn't even play a monkey right. Thought you'd get away with that brick act, didn't you? It's garbage. Sharpen your knives! Sharpen your knives! This child isn't fated to be an actor. Not with that extra finger. He have a good face, but he can't. Sharpen your knives! I can afford to raise him. . . but he's getting too big to keep at the brothel. If only you take him, you can do anything you like. Don't look down on us. don't be foolish. Prostitutes and actors are equally despised by society. Just go away. Ma, my hands are freezing. They feel like ice. Ma! Get away from us, you son of a whore! It's from the whore house! Drop it on the foor! Are you bullying him? Come over here. Sleep with me! You're really something ! Laizi, go snuggle up with the Little Monk. Catch ! It's so cold outside. . . the piss froze on the tip of my dick. I nearly turned a somersault! If you belong to the human race, you go to the opera. Pigs and dogs don't listen to opera. If you don't go to the opera, you're not a human being. And where there's opera, there's work for us actors! Stop squealing ! Straighten that back! If you think you're above everyone else. . . you'll learn the hard way. This is just the beginning. Don't worry, Douzi. We're already half way through. Shitou, are you helping someone cheat? Master, I was looking up. I didn't notice what was on the floor. Bullshit! Get me my sword. And hurry up! Get up! Don't you have something to say? Yes. Forming cliques is prohibited and wi'll be punished. He's not fucking scared of anything. From the time opera began. . . It's never enjoyed such popularity as it does today! You're lucky to be part of it! We are! Heavens will... not a lack of material skill. . . I've been practicing kung fu to keep myself warm. It's cool out side, quite cool. But I've become a man of fire. Get away from me. I am so strong, I can uproot the Mountains. . My courage is renowned I've fallen on bad times Yet even my horse Won't run away to save itself. These are our rules. We must learn them well. From ancient times, man has needed a skill. If you devote yourself to this, you'll get paid off. Now go off and practice! Let's hear Fleeing by Night. I look back at the Celestial Court and hurry on wards in fight. . . Heedless of. . . heedless of. . . Heedless of what? Heedless of loyalty and filial piety. I am so strong, I can uproot the mountains. Yet even my horse Won't run away to save itself. And my beloved concubine, what shall I do about her? Excellent, not a word out of place. Give me your hand. This is so you'll remember to do as well the next time. I am a nun. . At sixteen I am a nun. My hair is shorn at youth's prime. Go on. I am by nature a boy...

I am by nature a boy. . . Is a nun a male or a female? A. . . A boy. . . You really are in character. You can't even tell male from female. I-l-l am by nature a boy. . . You've forgotten everything the master has taught you! Do it again, and I'll beat you within an inch of your life. You'd better remember this. If by chance I'm beaten to death tomorrow. . . The three copper coins hidden under my mattress. Careful ! Don't water your hand ! Douzi, in a few days, you'll be initiated into the troupe. Just pretend you're a girl, and don't mess up the lyrics again. Laizi, have you ever eaten sweet pea cakes? Whats the big deal about sweet peacakes? How about millet rolls? Basin cakes? The're about as fucking special as dog farts. So what do you like? There's nothing yummier than a stick of candied crab apples. If I make it big, I'll eat candied crab apples every day for dinner. Candied crab apples for sale! Candied crab apples for sale! Don't look at us like that. We're not sticks of apple. Laizi, you're drooling ! Laizi, What the hell are you doing? Wow, so many big kites! Douzi, we got only 2 days to go. Run for it! Come back! Douzi ! we got 2days. . Don't forget the money under my pillow. You're worthless. Get out of my sight! Where'd you get that? Forget Shitou. I'm spending your money now. Ten apples on each stick. I'll give you two. What's wrong with you? I have to pee real bad. Not in the middle of the street. It's Manager Wang ! The stars have arrived ! here, come this way. My dear sir, this is like a visit from heaven ! All you need to do is sneeze and you get a standing ovation. Thanks for coming here. We'll be lucky if no one is trampled to death in there! I'll sit on your shoulders for a while, then you sit on mine. The king ! It's the King of Chu! What does it take to become a star? How many beatings? When I'll ever enjoy such fame? You're pissing all over me! Are you nuts? I knew you'd go back. You couldn't live without Shitou! We're going to get a taste of the sword. But I'm not afraid. For me, it's like having an itch scratched. I've eaten my candied crab apple. I'm a fucking star already. You little runts, you've come back after all. Good ! I deserve it! Good ! I deserve it! Why the hell did you Let them go? Die you runts! Skipping class and running away must be punished ! Master, I'll never do it again. Please let me go! You let them get away? Assholes! Master! I wouldn't dare do it again, master. I was wrong. Beat me instead ! Didn't you think youd get yours? I'll kill you! Douzi, speak! Say something ! Beg for mercy! Say he's beaten you well ! Speak! Let's just disband the troupe! Youre killing Douzi ! I won't let you do this! Master Guan ! Laizi, he- This opera tells the story of war between the Chu and han kings. What sort of a man was the King of Chu? A peerless and invincible hero. . . a bold and resourceful general capable of defeating vast armies. But fate wasn't on his side. At Gaixia he was outwitted. . . by the Han king. As they prepared for battle, Han's troops sang victory songs. . . because of Han's military tatics, the Chu armies fed in a great panic had their country taken by Han. Even the king was weeping. No matter how resourceful you are. . . you can't fight fate. The king had once been all-powerful, but in the end. . . all he had left was one woman and one horse. He tried to get his steed to run away, but it wouldn't go. he wanted his concubine to free, but she wouldn't. For the very last time, Concubine poured wine for her king. . . and danced for him with a sword. . . then cut her throat with it, to keep her fidelity. Theres a lesson in this story for all of us. . . that each person is responsible for his or her own fate. You better keep that in your mind. I am so strong, I can uproot the Mountains My courage is renowned I've fallen on bad times Yet even my horse won't run away to save itself Old Man Zhang has commissioned you to hire an opera troupe. I truly congratulate you. With your patronage, the children will have new clothes to wear. Good opera, however, is not so simple. When he was a palace eunuch. . . Old Man Zhang attended operas with the Empress Dowager herself. I could lose a lot of respect. But that's nothing. You realize that if the performance doesn't make the grade... This kids got something. How long he's been in training? Douzi, come here and pay your respects. he's got a nice little figure too. Can you sing any old-style operas? Yes, two. Fleeing by Night is for male and outside the Nunnery is for female... Let's hear a bit of the last. At sixteen I am a nun. . . my hair shorn at youths prime. Yet I am by nature a boy, not a girl... Why- Mr. Na, I am terribly sorry! he's usually very good. Master Guan, I'll see you some other time. Open your mouth. open it! You've screwed it up for all of us! I'll teach you. I am by nature a girl, I am by nature a girl, At sixteen I am a nun. . . my hair shorn at youths prime. Yet I am by nature a girl, not a boy. Why must I wear these sexless robes? I see the joyful couples pass. . . in their splendid brocades. Despite myself, desire burns in my heart. . . Year after year All over the land I've followed my king on his military campaigns enduring the wind And frost and hard toil. . Our people are fallen into abyss of misery. . This little boy. . . Master Guan. . . Mr. Zhang, may you live as long as South Mountain. The king is here. Your highness The people have suffered untold hardship and pain this is an old man Zhan's special reward for two kids. So take this. Yes, sir! The Chu king would have won with this sword ! If I were emperor, then you'd be queen of the palace. Take that sword. Careful, kidys! That's a real blade! No need to run ! What's wrong? The sweat stings the scratchs Have them go together. No way. It's an old rule around here. Master Guan, I'm sorry if you don't understand. The concubine has to die one way or the other. Isn't it so? Master? Douzi ! What year is this? This is. . . this is 1932. Wrong ! This is still the Ching dynasty! Come over here. I. . . I want to find Shitou. I need to pee. Pee into this. Don't waste it. just pee into this. Come to me! Douzi ! What's happened to you? Have you gone dumb? Speak to me! Douzi. Fate has determined each of our lots. Leave him to his destiny. All right, look at the camera! Gentlemen, you have done grandly for yourselves. You look so dignified and stunning in any style of clothing. That's it! Oppose Japans invasion of North China! Damn ! It's those students again. Down with Japanese imperialism! Are'nt they the opera actors? How can you put on make up and sing opera at a time like this? Have you no feeling for your country? We're Chinese too, Chinese to the core! Look at us, goddamn it! Chinese mustn't fight among themselves! we're all Chinese here! And don ' t you forget it! How dare they pretend to be patriotic! Why don't they go out and fight the Japanese soldiers? Cause you're penniless for women and marriage. . Do something ! You just want to find a way out... The one who was yelling the loudest would make a good actor. Remember the first time we performed Farewell, My Concubine? Only you remember that kind of thing. I know. It was your lucky day for you. Back then it was... I went there yesterday. I know you've been looking for the sword, but it's long gone. Long life for Deyie! Candied crab apples for sale! Candied crab apples for sale! We've got a sea of people. They're craning their necks to catch a glimpse of their idols. Even master Yuan is here to see you. It's a great honor for us. Go away! Go away! Mr. Duan. . . They're becoming impatient, please hurry! Trust me. They won't feel like they are wasting their money. Year after year all over the land I've followed my king on his military campaigns You be the judge. Has he not blurred I hate only the lawless tyrant Who plunged our people. . .of misery the distinction between theater and. . . male and female? He is now at the level of. . Your highness Ive caused you So much grief So, Master Yuan has come to see us tonight. I know. I sang so loudly, I drowned out the horns. I'll show him how great we are without his patronage. . But Duan. . Don't worry. At key moments. . . I squeezed my waist with my hands. . . so it hurts. . here? Master Yuan ! It's an honor. You deserve this. the Empress Dowager herself. . . never bestowed such a gift upon her favorite actors. Master Yuan, how can our Dieyi be worthy of your favor? Farewell, My Concubine has a long history. It evolved from the old-style opera Story of the Precious one. Many famous actors have fallen down in this role. I've never seen an actor as great as you are. Impressive. For a moment or two. . . this Yuan fellow was so entranced. . . He believed Concubine Yu had actually come back to life! Master Duan. . . When the king returns to camp and meets Concubine Yu. . . custom has it- He takes seven steps. You take but five. If the King of Chu fails to bear himself with majestic dignity. . . He's little better than a gangster putting on airs! Master Yuan, you are a master of the theater arts. You are an expert in all the varieties and facets of opera. I may probably be as you say. Please give us the benefit of your advice and criticism. If it's not beneath you, I'd like to invite you. . . to my humble home for some wine. There is still so much to be said about this opera. Im terribly sorry, Master Yuan. I've another drinking engagement... with a courtesan. With a courtesan... Nice taste you have. And MR. Cheng? Then we'll share our thoughts later. . Girls! Take care of our guest. Thank you for coming. Dieyi ! I am leaving too. Girls! Come entertain our guest. MR. Duan, this way please. Long time no see. MR. Duan. We've missed you. I'd like to see Miss Juxian. Ah, how shall I put it? You should've said that earlier. . She's not here at the moment. What can be done? how about this? Caifeng, come keep MR. Duan company. I really want to see her, Tell me the truth. Where is Juxian really? Upstairs? Or down? The phoenix roosts on the highest branches, of course! But shes pretty high-class. You reckon she'll go for you? You bet! I specialize in high-class. Ah, Miss Juxian- Bastards! Okay, we're bastards! You fucking bitch ! How dare you be so picky! Cut it out! Cause you are pretty! Cut it out or I'll jump! Jump! I'll follow on your heels. No matter where you are even after death, I'll be there Xiaolou! These guys are revolting ! They were forcing me to drink wine from their mouths. Come on, assholes. Jump! Now its your turn ! Bastards! Mother fuckers! All right, lets go! Oh, it's MR. Duan ! Listen, we're all here to have a good time. . . spend lots of money. So let's not pick fights, OK? Eeechhh ! Keep out of it, and get lost. Don't get upset. Scared? Juxian, you are to blame. Didn't you tell these gentlemen todays a special day? That we decided to announce our engagement today? That's right! Today is the ladys happy day. Drink a toast to me! Aren't you going to offer congratulations? You think you can fool us? Gentlemen, on this, my happiest day. . . allow me to drink to all of you! And now, something to sober you up. I heard you got into a fight at the house of Blossoms. You know the old story. . . about Panjinlians husband Does this mean theres a PanJinlian in your life? What are you saying? What do you want to hear? I was just fooling around. Come with me sometime. You'll see what its like. It'll be exciting. I'm sorry. I really am! I wasn't thinking. I really put my foot in it this time. I'm a damn fool. Have you forgotten the secret of our success? Don't you remember our teachers words? Which words were they? Stick together until the day you die. I want you to be with me. How about we stay together until death? We've come this far together, havent we? It's not enough. Should be a lifetime. One day, even one second less. . . makes it less than a life time! Dieyi, you really are obsessed. Your obsession with the stage Carries over into your everyday life. But how are we going to get through the days. . . and make it in the real world among ordinary people? Give me a hand with my makeup! Concubine Yu the song was sung everywhere. . Out country is being ruined by the enemy. Go live out this goddamn fantasy, then. My king. I'll tell you even though it's heart breaking Today is the day we say goodbye you'll become a lady of virtue! Wake up. You think the wolves and tigers won't recognize your scent anymore? I am scared. Let me tell you something. Once a whore, always a whore. I'll keep that in my mind. Fine. See you around. MR. Duan has presented you with a pennant. The Beauty ofthe Age. It reads, What are you doing here? What is it, Juxian? Come on in ! No, you come out! What are you doing barefoot on such a cold day? What's happened? The house of Blossoms won't keep an engaged woman. Come. Let me introduce you. This is Miss Juxian. This is my stage brother, Dieyi. You may have seen him as Concubine Yu. Xiaolou speaks of you so often, I feel like we were old friends. MissJuxian. Excuse me, I must be going. Xiaolou, At the house of Blossoms. . . if you had'nt caught me, I'd be six feet under by now. Remember, it was you who proposed to me. I'm used to hardship. If you take me in. . . I'll wait on you hand and foot. If you ever abandon me, I'll ki'll myself. What a dragon lady! Whens the performance of. . . Candle-lit-night in the Bridal Chamber? Tonight. Hold on. I want a formal engagement ceremony. . . to which the entire company is invited. I want to enter your home as a proper bride. You don't think I plan to cut corners, do you? The formal engagement ceremony will be tonight. Gentlemen, we request the pleasure of your company. Miss Juxian. . . where did you study opera? Me, what makes you think that? Just the way youre over playing your part. Dieyi, shes going to be your sister-in-law. Also, at the engagement party tonight. . . I have'nt learned the opera Gangster King and his Whore. Our teacher never taught us that one. What are you talking about? Dieyi, Xiaolou has spoken good of you. Don't leave! Where are you going? None of your business. Xiaolou! Please, don't go! Master Yuan invites us tonight. he wants to become our patron. Who does he think he is? No one tells me what to do. I'm just a fake king. You really are Concubine Yu. Let him patronize you if you like. Xiaolou! This feather headpiece is rare and precious. The feathers are collected from the tails of live peacocks. That's the secret. . . to keeping the feathers soft and colorful. I'll be waiting for you. In this world, there is foulness in both men and women. only the bodhisattva embodies both male and female essences. Such ecstasy! This sword has a history. It once belonged to the eunuch Zhang. When Zhang went bankrupt, I went to great trouble to acquire it. I can see from this. . . you're old acquaintances. Amazing. one searches far and wide for something. . . Like it? I- Let's not have any vulgar talk of money between us. A precious sword is the classic gift for ones most intimate friend. What do you say? MR. Cheng... wl'll you be my most intimate friend? The soldiers of Han have invaded The songs of Chu Can be heard on all sides Since the good king has lost his fighting spirit Why should his humble concubine value her life Don't! It's a real sword ! A smile ushers in the spring. A tear does darken all the world. How truly does this befit you. To you. . only you are possessed of such charm. Ah, MR. Cheng. I knew you'd come. We saved a seat at the head table for you. You came back? It's a good thing you showed up. Have a look at this. What a sword ! How did you acquire this out of nowhere tonight? Dieyi, you've come so late. You better drink up! Yes, drink up! My gratitude, Miss Juxian. Dieyi? MR. Cheng ! Xiaolou. . . From now on, we'll no longer perform together. MR. Cheng, you can't do this! This isn't- The fans won't- This is terrible! Japanese troops have entered the city! Dieyi. . Where is Dieyi? I'll fill up your glass with finest wine. Special wine. So what is this wine called? Wine of overnight drinking. Fill it up. Who will be serving me tonight? Dieyi looks like lifting his shoulders up. . Cause a man's life is meaningless it's like dream of spring. . At your disposal. . I will keep on drinking until this night is over. Don't waste my time just take it off. Even if it belongs to your ancestor you should let him put it on. Understand me, low life? Tell the Japanese I'll be there right away. Hold on a moment. It's not some private party. They're black mailing you to sing for them. On the other hand, you're the only one. . .who can save Xiaolou. on the other hand, If anything happened to you. . . this theater of mine would- All right, go then. MissJuxian, what are you doing? MR. Cheng isn't at home! Wheres Dieyi? Dieyi? hurry! I've heard the Japanese feed prisoners to their dogs! If you delay, he might not have a life to save! Dieyi ! But you allowed them to take him away in the first place. Xiaolou has looked after you since you were small. What are you saying? Mr. Na, would you mind leaving the room for a moment? I have something to say to Dieyi in private. Everyone says Miss Juxian is quite clever. . . Were all trying to help Xiaolou. Talk it over. How about a clear answer? Are you going or not? Say something ! I know what's on your mind. I have a proposal. If you can get Xiaolou out of there in one piece. . . I'll go back to the house of Blossoms. I'll keep away from both of you. hows that? At the house of Blossoms, you don't have to worry about much. Life is a lot simpler there. Just remember, you said it, not me. I give my word. The flowers have blossomed Their season is past All has fallen Only the sun is still the same. Into ruin and decay Xiaolou! My brother! Xiaolou, are you all right? Did you sing for the Japanese? Theres one called Aoki genuinely likes opera. Xiaolou! All right. Come here! Let me have another drink! okay. I'll drink one for you. I think this opera, Farewell, my concubine. . . has turned into. . . Farewell, my king. The king's really irrelevant. Drink this. Your voice will pierce the heavens. . . Alright, come. Forget the opera. Let's just live a quiet life. We'll have a fat little baby boy. Then I'll have everything I want. That's enough. No more opera. Let's go! Then, bye. Give me the money back. Not the crickets, my money. You borrow the money on your host's credit, right? Go! I can't believe such a grown-up like you is busy playing with bugs and not working ! Work? I'm an actor. What else can I do other than acting on stage? Shall I carry coffins? You should be satisfied by now. No need to shout like that! Here's the money? What? Don't need it? I'll apologize if I were going too far. Unless you take caution, they will get you. The master wants to see you. No, I won't. Look at this sword. Master, they've just arrived here. Who? Dieyi and Xiaolou whom you've wanted to meet. What a great fucking honor. What the hell they are doing here? Well, I finally got something to brag about. A great fucking honor. Take your seats there and bow to me. Master. You are finally here. Dieyi. Without my help, you are nobody. And I left the stage. Now it's your turn to help me. Hit me ! Come on ! Douzi ! Xialou! You are now all grown up and now great actors with fame Don't remember your youth? what's worrying you? Just hit him hard. When did I tell you to look down on me? Are you going to ruin operas? It's your fault! Take this! I'm to blame. Blame me. Wait. I have to tell you this. Xialou is my master. If you want to hit him you need my permission. . Knock it off! I've heard of one bitch, and it was you! So you must be the VIP today, right? Take your seat. Feel at home drinking some tea. Alcohole, gambling and women. . and even crickets? You fucking ruined opera's tradition ! Nothing's wrong to beat you with a cigaret stick for your disgrace. For an opium addicted brother. . what is the crime? Juxian ! It's not time for a whore to interfere. . Isn't it your way to hear their excuse? Shut the fuck up! Don't be so stupid ! You are such a nice guy! Hit him! Unless you become quiet I'll cut his throat! Alright. You kill one taking two lives! Your family will be over. Did you just ask me to stand up? Xialou, are you listening to me? You are becoming a father. If I stay away from being an actor I won't be able to buy a birthday present for my kid ! Come closer! Closer! Practice! Don't be slacking. Stretch out your legs! Wait. This play is called Anger of Night. You act Linchou for this. He's head of the palace guard, not some sneaky little thief. Take this. Attention, everyone! This is what a great hero is like. A man does'nt lightly shed his tears. . . Unless his heart has broken. Leave me alone. I'm just taking master's purnishment. The troupe has disbanded. You leave too. Master said that you. Should learn how to endure to become a great actor. Everyone else has left. You ought to go home too. I was found on the street as a baby. I've got no other home. Do you know, who found you? No! They said if I knew, ld get a swelled head and would'nt work hard. Do you sti'll want to sing opera? Yes, even if I have to beg to support myself! . What's your name? Xiao Si. Xiao Si. AS CHIANG KAl-SHEKS NATIONALIST ARMY RETAKES BEIJI NG. I hear the talk of the soldiers. Xiao Si, go tell the manager to avoid trouble. And it is all about running away. What's this? Why aren't you singing? Don't make trouble! Don't go, Xiaolou. Waving flashlight is not allowed in the theater. Even the Japanese didn't do this sort of thing. Everyones here for the opera. Please return to your seats. Well put. Back to your seats, everyone! But can we let him get away with speaking up for the Japanese? Xiaolou! Xiaolou! Juxian ! We have to get her to a hospital. Save her first! There was only a minor disturbance. Are you saying such a big disturbance is minor? You can fine us. Why do you need to arrest anyone? The theater's been trashed, people beaten. . . and you sti'll want to arrest him? What for? Cheng Dieyi betrayed the country to the Japanese. Move it! On what base? Teacher, teacher! MR. Duan, I'm afraid she's lost the baby. Honey. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Go, help Dieyi. If he's more important to you. I don't know whether Dieyi goes looking for trouble. . . or if it's trouble that comes looking for him. Whenever you're with him, my heart's in my throat. Now that I've lost our child, you're all I have left. I don't care if I have to beg with you on the streets. All I ask. . . is peace of mind. If you help him now, we'll no longer owe him anything. Don't perform with him anymore. Promise me this. No more performance after this. Master Yuan. . . Dieyi's life is in your hands. Count this. If it's not enough- If only you'll save Dieyi. . . we'll give all our earnings for the next three years. You think I need your money to keep my birds from starving? And this gentleman is. . .? Don't you recognize Xiaolou? he plays the king to Dieyis concubine. Then it should be him who saves Concubine Yu! My dear man, that s only a play! All Beijing knows that Master Yu is the true king of the theater! It's true. Speaking of which, I'd like to ask MR. Duan something. When the king returns to see Concubine Yu. . . how many steps should he take? Seven. Show me. Come on, show me! Master Yuan. Is this the honorable home of MR. Yuan? When a man called Cheng Dieyi was arrested, he said. . . the owner of this sword would be able to rescue him. Do you recognize it? From your expression, I see I've come to the right place. Good. I'll put the sword here. I'm so relieved to have found its owner. But sometimes one's hopes are misplaced. Master Yuan, you must'nt blame Dieyi. I see. The reason why Dieyi performed for Japanese would'nt be by someone's request, would it? If it would, he wouldn't have been arrested. True! There's a roomful of reporters waiting at home. Xiaolou, MR. Na, lets go. Wait, a moment! Let's talk. Master Yuan asked me to talk to you. Tomorrow in court. . . say the Japanese put a gun to your head. Say they tortured you. Master Yuan has made arrangements for everything else. This is from Xiaolou. Dieyi, don't be angry with us. Xiaolous child. . . It's died. Your karmic partnership with Xiaolou caused this! After you get out of here, just go your own way. During the resistance against Japan Cheng Dieyi betrayed the country by performing for Aoki and his colleagues. You performed for their immorality. The defendant also encouraged the enemy and disgraced your people. Aoki continued to resist even after Japan officially surrendered. We've collected these pictures as evidence. . . and they confirm the defendant sang for the Japanese. We call on the witnesses Yuan Shiqing, Duan Xiaolou and Na Kun. The government has always been good to me. Nor would I betray the laws of heaven or my own conscience. Cheng Dieyi was taken away in hand cuffs by the Japanese. They put a gun to the back of his neck. He couldn't help. . Duan Xiaolou! It's true. The Japanese beat up my stage brother. Exactly as Master Yuan has just described. Na Kun? He- The prosecutor claims Cheng performed obscene material. That is ridiculous! Cheng performed highlights from Peony Pavilion that night. Anyone with any common sense knows that. . . Peony Pavilion is the quintessential Chinese opera. How can that be obscene to the prosecutor's eye? How dare they insult our tradition and culture like this!

How about this? Well done right? Dieyi, should I mail this to. . .? The usual address. All you classic consumptive heroines burn your letters. Have you seen this? Do you want it? If you don't, I'll tear it up. I'll tear it up. I'll do it! Xiao Si ! I gave Master Duan the sword returned to you by Master Yuan. The river's course is twisted, but in the end it fows to the sea.

Yuan Shiqing is an enemy of the People, he must die! Death to Yuan Shiqing ! Be alert! Execute Yuan Shiqing ! Yuan Shiqing has always opposed. . . He has harmed his community and is guilty of monstrous crimes. Only execution can satisfy the People's anger! Down with the counter- revolutionary Yuan Shiqing ! Destroy him! Down with the tyrant of the opera world, Yuan Shiqing ! Satisfy the People's anger! Death to Yuan Shiqing ! Execute Yuan Shiqing ! Take him away! Let me go! I'll kill them all ! Stop carrying on ! Listen carefully! Keep your voice down. Let me go! Release me! Fuck you! Cut it out or I'll hit you! How is he? We may need to wean him from the opium slowly. Don't go, Xiaolou. If he really wants to overcome his addiction. . . It feels like ice. Mom! The river may get frozen. It feels like ice. It's getting frozen. Mom! So cold. The sky of the liberated are as is clear and blue, Mrs. Duan ! Where were you? A meeting. A meeting? Xiaolou, the whole troupe's come. Ah, a costume change! Thank you all for coming to see me. I'm fiine now. Sounds easy now. you didn't see him suffer! Dieyi, get out of bed. All of Beijing is waiting for the next appearance of the King and his Concubine! It'll be the goddamn golden hit of a golden era. You've asked me to say a few words. I'm not sure how to put it. I think these modern operas are interesting. . . but the costumes aren't very attractive. The backdrops are too realistic. Yet Beijing opera puts great value on ambiance. Song recital, movement and acrobatics are part of this ambiance. But with these costumes on, performance won't look good. I know, it really concerns me. What do all of you think? Are you saying that modern operas aren't Beijing operas? No sound is but a song, no movement is but a dance. It must have beauty. For instance- Teacher, I don't get it. Practice. When you've sweated enough to fill buckets, you'll get it. I still don't understand. Xiao Si ! I just don't get it. What can I do! Why is it Beijing opera when ancient heroes and beauties take the stage. . . but not when the laboring masses do? You're talking apples and oranges. upstart! What kind of attitude is that? I'd like to hear from Teacher Duan. Xiaolou! It's going to rain. I've brought your umbrella. Yes, yes, run along home now. Questions like these give me a headache. I say if it uses the traditional forms, then it's Beijing opera. Am I right? I'd like to say something. I've been part of the New Society since giving my theater to the state. Comrade Cheng, I believe you're wrong. Modern opera is a new venture. It deserves our support. Opera requires practice, don't think you know it well ! Opera requires practice, skill and talent. No easy way. You're breaking the law. You'll always be third-rate. And when did you ever seriously want me to succeed? All you've ever wanted was a coolie, a stagehand. . . a follower, a bit player! How dare you! How you say such rubish ! Kneel down ! Master Cheng. You won't live to see the day! Xiao Si ! Go, then ! Be a bit player your whole life! MR. Cheng. . . Your saying belongs to the past. Doesn ' t it? It's a death in the present day. If I end up being the third rate You won't keep your face. So, you know? Uh, I just learned myself. That's not true, Teacher Duan. You were there at the meeting last night. You said you'd notify Dieyi that you were replacing him. I had second thoughts. I decided you should tell him. Don't you agree? If you couldn't tell him, who could? Take it off! . Take it off! . Don't. Don't be like that! I won't fucking sing anymore! Let whoever wants to perform do so. Xiaolou, you mustn't go. Comrade Duan. . . That audience is made up of the laboring masses. You decide whether you'll sing for them or not. Xiaolou, the concubine is on stage. You'd better hurry. I've followed my king on his military campaigns Enduring the wind and frost and hard toil Year after year I hate only the lawless tyrant Who has plunged our people into an abyss of misery The people have suffered untold hardship and pain The king has returned to camp! I'm here. Your highness. Thank you very much, Miss Juxian. Dieyi ! Dieyi, open the door! open up! Won't you accept my apology? That little snake you rescued... He has turned into a veritable dragon ! You have to go along with it! What else can you do? No matter what, as you told me, you have to keep on singing ! and see what's playing in the theater of life these days. Douzi, listen to your stage brother. Go with the times! I'll still be the king and you my concubine! Why does the concubine have to die? Dieyi, why are you so impossible? That's the play, for heaven's sake! 1966 - THE EVE OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION Central People's Radio will now broadcast. . . the decision of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. . . regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. . . passed on August 8, 1966, The bill for Cultural Revolution has passed. Cultural Revolution will reconstruct people's mind. how can you drink at a time like this? I feel like it. Anyway, jade cups were part of the old Society. We can't keep them, so we might as well use them one last time. It still won't break! I'm so afraid ! I dreamed I was on top of a tall building alone amongst the clouds. I wanted to jump. Jump! I'd catch you. You weren't there. Xiaolou, don't leave me. Where did this sword come from? Cheng Dieyi gave it to me. How many times did he give it to you? Twice. When was the second time? Shortly before the liberation of Beijing. Where? On. . on the street in front of the theater... What did you say to each other? It was quite chaotic. I don't remember. Try it. We didn't say anything ! Keep thinking. If we did, I can't recall. Something about what you'd do to the Communists? No! Certainly not! I'd stake my life on it. But what if we've got a witness? Who? Bring out the bastard ! Na Kun ! What did I say? I'll give you a hint. Something about ragtag troops. Na Kun ! This is pure slander! You reactionary old theater boss! You only want to protect yourself! . You said you'd take on their ragtag troops. No! I never said that! What I meant was- No, I said nothing at all ! Mr. Na, help me. Mr. Na! you've been smashing bricks since you were a boy, haven't you? Do it for us. Do it! Come on ! Duan Xiaolou, aren't you the King? No, I'm not. But you've always been the King, haven't you? That's just an opera. It's not real life. Did you go to brothels in the old Society? Yes. Don't you think that's shameful? Yes. When you married Juxian, what was she? A prostitute. Good. Now tell us what we need to know about Cheng Dieyi. Of course, you don't have to tell us anything. You saw what happened to Yuan Shiqing. Make your own decision. Sweep away all Cow Demons and Snake Spirits! We will destroy him! Cut off the Black hands! Uncover the Black Gangs! Seize the Black hands that have infiltrated the cultural world ! Sweep away all Cow Demons and Snake Spirits! Xiaolou! Duan Xiaolou is the reactionary king ! Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi are anti-Party elements! Down with Duan Xiaolou! Down with Cheng Dieyi ! Talk! Talk! Talk! All right, I'll tell you. he's totally mad about opera. Who? Make yourself clear. Cheng Dieyi ! All he cares about is opera. No matter who was in the audience, which class they belonged to. . . he'd still give it his all. You're not being straight with us! If you don't give in, we will annihilate you. At the start of the War of Resistance. . . he sang for the Japanese. He was a. . . a. . . a traitor! Down with Cheng Dieyi ! He sang for wounded Nationalist soldiers. . .

Sweep away all Cowdemons and Snake Spirits! Scholars and Beauties, Kings and Ministers, You've all betrayed me! Betrayed me! I've got something to unmask as well ! I'll reveal everything. Why do you think you sang for the Japanese? You're a shell of a man. Xiaolou, you've no conscience. You are as greedy as a wolf, From the moment you got involved with this woman. . . I knew you were fiinished. You think disaster just falls from the sky? No. No way. We have come step by step towards this fate. It's retribution. I'm despicable, and I have been so for a long time. But now even the King of Chu is on his knees begging for mercy! Can Beijing opera survive? It's doomed, is it not? This is what's called retribution ! Karmic retribution ! And I have something else to unmask. See that woman? Who is she? I'll tell you. Slut! Top whore at the house of Blossoms! Panjinlian ! Whore! Fight against her! Fight against her to the death !
