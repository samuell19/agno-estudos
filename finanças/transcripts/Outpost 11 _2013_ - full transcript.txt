The year is 1955 and the 2nd Hundred year war rages on. The British legions have been locked in battle with the Prussian war machine only to create a brittle stalemate which is lasted for decades. Deep in the Arctic circle and far from the front line a remote British outpost intercepts enemy transmissions and works on forbidden science to help win a war. This is the story about Outpost eleven and its crew. Long live the King. Blasted spiders. How many more times I have to tell you to stand up straight and keep your arms like this? Discipline is the only thing that separates us from the animals. I think we have a problem, sir. Well, what is it then? Well, that shouldn't be flashing. Shouldn't be flashing at all. Unless we are under attack. It just came on, five minutes ago, sir. The siren should be going as well. Its all part of inter post relay. You haven't heard any artillery or sky comings, have you? No, sir, nothing. It's all quiet. Must be the faulty circuit. You haven't been touching anything you shouldn't have, again? No, sir. I've been just passing transmissions. Where is Mason? He went out to the white, to hunt like he always does. He spends to much time outside, if you ask me He should be here, commanding his post. Is not as we have much to do here. It's not as we have much to do here, sir! Sorry, sir. We are soldiers in the British army and we have a duty to our King and country. You should be grateful not to be stationed on the southern front. I hear thousand people die per minute in the battle for east Antarctica. Yes, sir. Make yourself useful, go on check the Omega engine levels. But sir, that wouldn't affect what that light was on on. That's an order, private. Get on with it. It's only me. A man can not call him self a man, unless... Why do you always do this? Its me. It's protocol, sir. Jesus. A man can not call himself a man, unless he is been outside of box. Inside of box is reality, outside is insanity. You need to stop to be so serious, Graham. We are in the middle of the Arctic circle. I'm just doing what I was trained to do, sir. You know, strange things has happened to me out there. What was that, sir? I think someones put a bomb inside a wild hare. Sounds like a Prussian plot to try to kill us, sir. Yeah, well it almost worked. Why would you go so all that trouble if you are so far of any enemy base? They must be getting desperate, sir. They must know they are losing. A cowardly move, if you ask me, sir. I think it a bit more complex then that. Anyway, anything happened while I was out, corporal? Well, yes, there was actually. Please don’t tell me you want to reprimand Albert again for insubordination. No, sir. There was an electrical fault in warning light. But it seems it stopped now. Warning light? Yes, sir. It was just flashing, but the siren wasn't sounding. I better go on check it out, just in case. Very good, sir. Where is Albert? I ordered him to check Hymogen engine levels. Jesus, Graham... Huh... I am sorry about Graham, he knows you don't like it in here. It just get claustrophobic sir, hard to breathe sometimes. What's with the "sir"? You know you can call me, Mason. It's arctic hare for supper tonight and if you cook it half as well as last time we are in for a real threat. I'll be my best. Good boy. Why don't you go make a start on it now? Thank you, sir. Find anything unusual? No, sir. Mason is taking a closer look. I've been ordered to start dinner. Very good. Carry on. Why are you so unkind to Albert, hm? Is it because he is lower rank than you? or just you don’t like him? Permission to speak freely, sir? Of course, it’s adult time now. He is just so weak. I've never seen such pathetic excuse for a soldier before. He just makes my head really burn with rich. But he isn't a soldier. One not by choice anyway. The draft gets all of us, sir. It's not excuse. Albert is a disgrace to the uniform and must be reminded of it. I just not think that's the point. He is a boy. I've asked you before to take it easy on him. Now, I am telling you. That's an order. Yes, sir. I do prefer the black, but needs must when demon vomits to your face and tell you its snowing. Hear, hear. Wake up, Albert. What did you see? Tell me what did you saw? I think I saw God, and he was a machine. God is dead. We killed him. A, J, K, F, four, five, Z, M, J, eight, six, I, L, N, M, three, H Use code sheet three and eight is your variable. -I know this is against protocol, but-- -Message ends. -What the hell is it this time? -Sir, we have received a communication. Look at you man. You are a disgrace. Suit yourself out. We have received a communication, sir. Gosh, it was a while since the last one. Yes, sir. I was beginning to think we have lost the war. Have you no respect for your King and country, private? Sorry, sir. -God save the King. -Yes, long live the King. And damn you tasteless human. If it was up to me I'll have you whipped for insolence. What's wrong with the issued notebook? It was over fast, sir. I had to use whatever was in front of me. I suppose that's what you would called using your own initiative. You should be prepared to take messages all the time. It is your job. Sir, I know. It just doesn't happen that often though. The soldier is always alert and ready for action. You've been here for two years. Will you ever get it? I try my best, sir. Try a bit harder then, will ya? No wonder they sent you out here. You are disgrace to a British army. What's on the tape, sir? I don’t know, but it will be important if its in the safe. Well? Shouldn't you be intercepting enemy transmissions? Yes, sir. No hare today, gentleman. We have received a coded message, sir. Well, did you decoded it yet? No, I just started it now. You know what this means? We could be going home. Now, bloody time soon. I hope my next post is a bit warmer. Yeah, warmer. Don't you stand there man. Let's crack on. "God has forsaken us abandon all hope" "God is with us await further instructions" Parasites. -You rang? -Yes, sir. Message is decoded but, I’m afraid its all about cryptic. Well, go on. Message reads: "God is with us, await further instructions" -Is that all? -Yes, sir. Oh, damn fools and their superstitions. I think they just trying to let us know everything is alright. I think it sounds rather positive. Well, I doubt it was ever gonna be negative. It's just propaganda, to keep us working. Five years in this dreadful hole. Doing the dirty work for a government I didn't even vote for. We all have to do our time, sir. It's our duty to the King. You have no idea what's going on here, do you? You ever thought why you love this job so much? -It's all I known man and boy. -Exactly. Remind me What did you do before the War? I was at... -I think-- -All you know is war. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I apologise. You are right, Graham. I am the King's loyal servant. Long live the King. Yes, long live the King. The King! God has Forsaken us. Abandon all hope. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I don't know why he lied about it. Because this post is all he has. But surely he is just in denial. Graham isn't normal, Albert. He is true soldier from the Old war. How many of them left and only certainly can't ever go home. I don't understand... Oh, look... It doesn't matter now, Albert. We have to find out what this message means. Contact HQ. Are you OK, sir? Yeah, it's just my head. I've had a few headaches last couple of nights. Lack of sleep, I think. Do you think we lost the war? I don't know. But, I’m sure I've seen this message before. It could be code. But Graham is in charge of all the codes and he has the keys of the safe. Yeah. He does. Sleep well? Not a wink, sir. Not to worry. For all goes to much I can fill in for an hour or two. Thank you, sir. -Sleep well. -Thank you, sir. Graham, one last thing. Could you leave me the keys, please? Time to file my report. No need, sir. Just call me when you are ready and I will come open it for you. No problem. I think I'll take them anyway. I wouldn't want to disturb you and I don’t know how long am I gonna be. You get yourself a good night's sleep. You deserve it. "God has forsaken us" "Initiate plan nine" Plan nine - do not watch unless instructed by base commander. Can you hear that? Sounds like Graham crying. There is something seriously wrong with that man. No one should be alive after what he's been through. I am general Lord Hall. If you are watching this cassette it means that "Plan nine" has been initiated. As you now know, Plan nine means either one of two things. First, Prussian war machine has taken our capital and we are under siege. If your warning system has alerted you to this eventuality you would be fully aware that any supply or relieve will be unable to reach you. Unfortunately, due to the secret nature of your mission, no record of your outpost exists. Your last duty to the King, must be to destroy all the experiments and work that could fall into enemy hands. I repeat: all work must be destroyed. Even projects of biological nature. The second and more personal threat is the use of enemy armament against you. These... deadly... ...such kind of weapons Sky cannon, Tesla howitzer... ...and any other weapon system we are not fully aware of at the present time. The enemy... ...with the use of fear. You must carry out your orders however severe the consequences and react to the situation accordingly. I wish you the best of luck. Long live the King. Mason? Mason! You won't win! You bastard! Please, tell me where you are going? I'm going to find Cranly. He'll know what to do. Who's Cranly? An old friend. Just tell Graham I gone further in field to hunt. How long will you be? I don't know. Last time I walked it was few years ago. Took about a day. I don't trust Graham. -He is different. -We are all different. Now the war is over, the world will never be the same again. -I think he broke the computer on purpose. -You have to be strong, Albert. Just stay on the right side of Graham. I'll be back in no time at all. I'll try. Took you long enough. Sorry, sir. I was just sleeping. It was my shift off. There is no time for sleep now, Albert. This place is a mess. Needs to be tidied up. What part particular would you like me to focus on? All of it. Now get a move on. Yes, sir. That's a good boy. And what about a cup of tea, as well? Yes, sir. Graham. Did you just said something? No, sir. Must be the static. Back to work. Graham, this is HQ. Sorry we had to contact you this way. Secrecy is the key. We have a mission for you Graham and it's of the utmost importance. We've been led to believe that Albert is a spy for the Prussian-spider alliance. Spider... alliance? Yes, it's the worst fear come true. Desperate power act of a losing army to side with the insects. -But, it doesn't make sense. -Mr. Graham, your orders are simple. Watch Albert and on the slightest sign of treachery bring him down on all cost. He is not to be trusted. The fate of the King, rely on your hands, Graham. Mason is been gone long way. When was last time you saw him? When he left, sir. Just went out in the white to hunt, as usual. Mad, going outside in these temperatures. I hope he is alright. What? I said, I hope he is alright, sir. Yes, he should fine. Excellent, I’m starving. Oh... But, it's such a delicious meat, sir. You said so yourself before. You know I don’t like spiders. You know I don’t like spiders. You know I don’t like spiders. You know I don’t like spiders. You know I don’t like spiders. You know I don’t like fucking spiders. Now clean this mess up. Stupid boy. What new insanity, is this? -Yes, sir? -Get your rifle man. There is something outside. What was it, sir? Don't know, it was big and move fast. Came right out of white, I think. I think it could have gone, sir. Perhaps it would be best if you got some sleep. I could keep watch for you. So, you think I am tired and I imagined it all in my head? Did you? You little bastard. I will see you hanged for this soldier. - Questioning superior officer. -I didn't say that, sir, no... Don't talk back to me, you little shit. I am in command. Go over to Omega engine room, now, and rehydrate the core. Please, no sir. Anything but that. You should have thought about that before questioning my command. Now get out of here, before I shoot you dead. Stop this. Please don't, listen to me I am begging you. Please don't do this! Don't do this! Corporal You stupid boy. Stupid spider. I already know about Albert and your alliance. Ahhhh... Cranly! My God... my God. 11th May, warning light started flashing. On the inspection of code book, we realised we were under attack from psychotropic weapons. HQ was informed. 12th May. Warning lights continue to flash. James has reported troubles sleeping. Telling us that the devil visits him in the night. Eric has started to show a strange obsession with capturing hares. 13th May. I was convinced I saw a Zeppelin in the fog last night. Still no reply from the HQ. I am starting to question if we will ever get one. 15th May. Finally a reply from HQ. But, unfortunately a disappointing one. Message read: "We are aware of the situation and are working to resolve it." "Prepare your men mentally for what can only be described as temporarily insanity." "The enemy had made a deal with the demon himself in creating this weapon." "But your strong British will will help you endure." James has eaten his own hand. I fear for our lives. 17th May. Eric is one of them. He was gone when I awoke. After hours of tracking I finally caught up with him". When confronted, he threatened me with a hare, and I was forced to lays him down, on the middle. it was a ugly business, but I fear he was trying to flea to outpost 11. 19th May. I can't control myself anymore. Cranly! I am under the illusion of constant enemy attacks... But when ever, I take a second look they disappear. It's so really frighten me to the very core of my being. 30th June. Uhm. I can see all. And all can see me. Only through complete integration with the Omega core. Can I truly hope to destroy my silent stalkers? God. Please, help me, help me! What have you done now, you stupid boy? Please, please, help me, help me! Precious core fluid, wasted. You really messed up best now. My eyes, please! Can you see this? -No, no, I’m so scared, please! I'm afraid you are blind. Probably for life. Oh God, no! No need to bring God into this. It's your mistake. I imagine you learned a very valuable lesson here today. Here we go. The trouble with eyes is that, even with them you are still blind. At least now, you can make yourself useful. Hallo? Who is this? No, you are not, spiders can't use phones. Never, you beast. He is a traitor to his kind. You don't understand the things I been through. The things I have seen. I know God holds no place for me, and I accept that. I was born into a life of violence and when I die, I'm doing my duty to the King. I fear it is time to take this debacle to the next level. Prepare yourself for battle. You will die for this treachery. Albert! Mason? No, it's general Lord Hall. No time for pleasantries, Albert. You must stop Graham. But I can't see, sir. Look... Graham is a soldier of the old school. All the war in his genetic programming is left him all twisted. He will kill both of you and Mason. Tell me what to do, sir? Right. Go to the corner of the room, where your rifle is, remember? And hurry Albert. He is coming. Hurry, Albert he is outside. Quickly, Albert! Now, shoot, damn it, shoot now! Hello? Albert! Oh my God! Mason... I didn't know! You have to get to Omega core. It's the catalyst for the psychotropic weapons. If you do that, this madness will be over. I'm so sorry. Graham, Graham was gonna kill us. It's fine, I forgive you. -I didn't know, Mason... -Just get to the core. -I'm so sorry... -Albert, listen to me, get to the core, now! Oh, God. Stop there, Graham. It's far enough. What the fuck! We are under attack for weapons which are sending us all mad. You are not in control of your own mind. Jesus wept... A man can not call himself a man... A man can not call himself a man... I'm sorry, Albert. Argh! OMEGA CORE OUTPUT LEVELS Albert! I just wanted to see my girlfriend again. I couldn't save them. -I only did what I was told. -Didn't wanted to be like this. -I wish I just quit. -I wanted to die for a King. Why me? -I have no choice. -... destroy. Win, cap. That's the problem with you. You always play for win. Oh, what else you expect me to do? Some things just aren't worth winning. So, you are saying aren't worth playing either? No, we all play our part. Not given a choice in that much. I am just saying that sometimes the things we do as individuals can outlive the victories of armies and ideologies of empires. Seems like you and I are playing different games. Perhaps. Another? Yeah. One more before bed time. Same price? Yes. But take it easy on him, alright? Good
