(a dog barks) (writing on a typewriter) (the dog growls a little) Simba... ssshh, calm down. "I hereby declare that I have taken my own life." "It was I who murdered Uncle Theodor on May 13." "May God forgive me. Betina Eriksen." (the dog barks) You don't just have to endure stuffing yourself with beer bread! But it is also full of lumps. And the sweat is it! They knew well that dr. Joergensen has prescribed the beer bread each morning. - We would like to see you get well. - If you don't want me here, I can travel then! - Go to hell! - That was not what I meant. Add m-more s-sugar. S-so the cl-lumps pro-bably slide down. Ha-ha-ha-hand me the sugar. (Mr. Rasmussen laughs) - Queen beats D7. - Runner F8. Tower H8. Grossier Eriksen is on the phone. Look, Johanne, isn't it delightful! I told you it would be modern with ribbon and flowers. Excuse me, may I be allowed. Oh, Johanne, how it would wear me! Undoubtedly. It is impulsive but charming. Yes, isn't it true! Pink ribbons and spring flowers. Yes, adorable for a teenager! - Good morning. - Good morning. Queen, C7. - Have we all had a restful night? - Yes, thank you. - Thank you, miss. Emma. - Doctor, I've had trouble with... Is it now wrong with the discharge again? - Bon appetit. - (Mr Rasmussen laughs) - Wh-what did Uncle Theodor say? - The ad is in today. "Ellerkilde for sale." (Mr. Rasmussen slurps) - Runner C4. - Jumper F6. - Did you know that Ellekilde is for sale? - What do you say? - Ms. Eriksen's uncle wants to sell. - It is very unfortunate for her! Ms. Eriksen said everything was done to prevent that. It's in the newspaper. Elsa, you can clear the table. Mrs. Carlsen, check the office. - D-doctor... - There are clu-clumps in Mr. Eriksen. Let's meet down in the park. Ouch!!! - Ugh! Only he got a blood clot! - Yes, he is mean. - Johanne, I've got a great idea! - Oh, now again. I have an idea with the big shadow and the vail. - If I snoop around town... - You'll look like a mess. - Johanne, you're the dullest on this Earth! - AM I? Contrary to that, you're one of nature's weirdest things. How did you become my sister?! They must have been in a bad mood when they made you or some bad weather! Director Theodor Eriksen? They are talking to manufacteur Berg. I'm calling about the ad. I love Ellekilde. Couldn't we arrange a time and meet outside? Asparagus soup is excellent. What shall we have for dessert? - (there is a knock on the door) - Yes! Come in. We'll be done soon. Pour us a glass of sherry, will you? (the dog growls a little) I had thought of meatballs and vegetables. So, Simba, calm down. And fish balls for the sick stomachs. Yes, it's not exciting to be a cook girl here. If only I can continue to be! Thanks, Ms. Carlsen. Let's drink to it. And let's hope for a miracle then. Cheers. - Thanks for the sherry. - (the phone is ringing) Hello, Ellekilde. Is that you again? Yes... at 2 o'clock. And you arrive a little earlier. Yes, I'll ask Osby to have the papers ready. A lover has signed up. It was uncle. I must tell you about his room. He'll probably stay here. - Should I clean it up? - Yes, and air out. - I will not take it! - Is it Mr. Petersen? Yes, he bites her when they ride in the elevator. - Shall we let Elsa look after him? - No, our lord is preserved! - Lend me your pocket towel. - D-d-d-that... The ladies are out enjoying the good weather. Yes, one gets so terribly bushed. Yes, it goes without saying! More thasn usual. I'm going down and have a sniff at the manufactory... Yes, that hysterical hat cannot interest dr. Joergensen. May I propose to the ladies a l'hombre after dinner? - Yes, we would like to, doctor. - Yes, with all the fool lines! - What is he doing in the bushes? - Yes, what do you think! Now remember to speak loudly and clearly. I don't stutter when... I have... balls in my mouth. Try spitting one out. They... must... soon... make... me... well... doctor. 2 more. I... have to... go... home ... to... my studies. Try 2 more. I co-co-come... Don't get discouraged. We almost got it. What is wrong? I-I'm s-s-so b-worried about Betina. She is terribly upset that Ellekil-de is to be sold. Can't you give her n-something comforting? Something to s-sleep on? Can't we make Ellekilde profitable again? I have previously suggested reducing the staff. Dr. Joergensen has, for example, 2 rooms in addition to his laboratory. It can be furnished for a pensioner. I have touched it for him. No, he is doing great scientific work! He also became somewhat pale and quite uncomfortable. His results are amazing and the patients love him. That was Uncle Theodor's idea to move him out here. - Yes, but it is also his money. - Money?! There is more to the world than money. Possibly. But not for your uncle. Osby, you are the financial administrator for Ellekilde. You are his advisor. Can't find a way out? He is about to invest most of the fortune in a giant project. - What kind of face is that? - It is stupid, ugly and poor. Gustav tells me, you have bad nerves. I'll get you something to sleep on. No, not your poison mixes. Save them for the patients. - You should try. - Why not decorate on the mood? The mood? I wonder who smiles, when Uncle Theodor comes? You can spare yourself that, Soerensen. It blows up. Yes, it is going north. Nerves... Clap failure. Ms. Emma big crap. Ms. Johanne no crap. Dr. Joergensen... know better. Hypochondria. Mr. Petersen... terminally ill. - I'll get Mr. Petersen. - Thanks. Or he won't get any lunch. Ugh! And me, who thought it was spring. It's probably Uncle Theodor, who's on his way. Have you started taking alerts? Betina, here is the most innocent thing I have. Thanks, but that's redundant. - Don't you want to take off your coat? - Yes, I will. - Let me. - I can do it myself! It's just to help you. - Springer G5, chess. - F beats runner. - Queen H5 Chess! - We are in the middle of a bloodbath. May I offer the ladies my protection? - Queen H7. - Runner E7. - Runner D2. - Runner B6. Now again, Mr. Petersen. Dr. Joergensen, will you explain? Your gut, liver and kidney need to be spared. They have advanced pancreatitis and hepatitis. - How interesting he is! - They can become dangerous for you. A hepatitis... gives sour in-cidents, right? - Yes, many and very angry. - It was so delicious! - Runner beats Runner. - Queen G8. Uncle Theodor? Already? I think first you said you came... - Elsa, another envelope. - No thanks, I've eaten. Stay seated. I go into the office and wait. - Can I have some milk? - Yes. - Water, Elsa. - Yes of course. - Runner C6. - Tower beats Springer. Ouch! - Tower H7. - Queen G8. - Queen beats E6. - Chess, runner E7. (Simba growls and barks) (Elsa screams) - Queen E7, chess. - Tower beats Queen. Stop killing each other! Runner H6, check mate. Elsa, will you pack your things and leave Ellekilde! - Gustav, call Bitten. - Y-yeah. Simba, go and lay down. B-b-Bitten, will you come up and help Mr. Petersen. - No! - Now I have to. I can't imagine that Mr. Petersen will grab me from behind. - He is looking for so much fun! Re-match? What should I say? "Sorry, Mr. Petersen, I'll take care of you while you pinch me!" This is a nursing home. If you don't get that you can be let go! Until then, mind your work! Wipe your eyes and get something to eat. He has club feet and a tail! I'll put him in the elevator shaft! Uncle Theodor? Queen E7. Runner C8 to E6. (Miss Emma laughs) What is it, that's so funny you can't keep to yourself? Mr. Petersen can't even have salad. Well, Mr. Petersen, we need to have our shot. And then a little nap, Mr. Petersen. As if I fathom, what happened with Uncle. - The potential buyers haven't come either. - I-I guess he's... given it up. - From Bitten and me. Pardon. - Thank you, Elsa. Nice of you. (the gong sounds) (he laughs) Bitten, put these with Ms Eriksen. It's something to sleep on. Make her take just one. She needs it. I thought I got rid of you. Ouch... for darn it! - They didn't see the light at all! - Very funny. I hope one day I can repay the debt. Peasant C4. Go ahead, Elsa. - E4. - E5. (Simba howls) Dogs only howl when there's dead! - Thanks, I can do it myself. - I just wanted to help you. - Queen hit 7G. - Runner F8. - Sugar and cream? - No thanks. - (the phone rings) - Now I have to. No, I'll take it myself. It could be Uncle Theodor. It is Ellekilde. Hello? ... Hello? - Ms. Betina Eriksen? - Yes... Who am I talking to? - Your uncle... - Has something happened to him? He has a knife in his throat... Your knife. Who are you and what do you want from me? They have murdered your uncle, miss. Betina. - It's a joke... isn't it? - I never jest. Miss, I just had a call. Where did it come from? Yes, just a moment. - (the dog howls quietly) - Simba... Simba. Yes, it came from Ellekilde. Thanks... Elsa, will you call for a carriage? I have to go to town. Our Lord is preserved, in that weather! Well, there you are, Doctor, we can get started. I can't understand... I must have misplaced my cigarette case. Emma! But God, child! Take her. Betina? Betina! No, it's a joke... - (she screams) - Then out, out with everyone. Emma and I will handle this. Yes, the cart is there. We've got to have the l"hombre to our credit. Are you coming up with some coffee? Just go, go. Drink. Thanks... I'm afraid I've been in for an unpleasant joke. A joke, that made you so anxious, - - that you're not sure it's a joke? I got a call. He didn't say who he was. But that my uncle had been murdered... with a knife, my knife. - Oh, how exciting! - Will you control yourself. (Simba growls) - It doesn't happen everyday, did disappear... He is in the closet... Look! (she screams) But... Well, there's Uncle Theodor. What on earth is he doing in there? And then he is even dead. What a mess. - Are you the ones who killed him? - No, no. Ladies don't get away with something like that in such a clumsy way. - I have to call the police. - No, our lord is preserved. These ossified officials and foul-smelling prisons, - - this is not a place for you. Emma, ??clean him up again. - It is our duty... - You have not murdered your uncle. The killer wants you to call the police. - Now you're rambling, Johanne. - Then we'll carve it out in paper. - Well... - Stop interrupting me. Your uncle has been murdered in your office with your knife. He was well on his way to destroying your existence. - They're going to inherit him, aren't they? - Yes, Gustav and I... Yes, this is carefully planned and your fingerprints are everywhere. On the knife, at the cupboard, and on the glasses there. God knows if you don't amaze me, Johanne. It comes as a shock to you that someone is thinking. The killer had two purposes with that call. To scare Betina and that Uncle Theodor should be found. And what do we do? We reassure Betina, - - and we don't find Uncle Theodor at all. Neither here nor there, and certainly not in the closet. - (Simba small howls) - Simba! - You are a genius. - Yes. There is something I forgot. That call came here from Ellekilde. Elsa, ask Ms Bitten to come to the office. Yes, I will. Bitten will help you to bed, take something to sleep on, - - and then we'll talk about it tomorrow. Bitten, will you come down here afterwards. (steps and a door opens up) There are some pills from Dr. Joergensen. - Shall I close the window... - No, thanks. - Well, then good night. - Good night, Bitten, and thank you. - Can we trust Bitten? - Depends on what you'll do. I didn't know... not yet. - (there is a knock on the door) - Yes. Bitten, will you answer me honestly on a few questions? - Yes. - Are you loyal to Ms. Betina? - I like her very much. - And you are a brave girl, aren't you? - I am a trained nurse. - Ms. Betina's uncle is murdered. He's sitting here in the closet ... with a knife to his throat. And you are just as brave when I tell you, the killer is here at Elleskilde? Yes! Will Ms. Betina not have Simba with her? Emma, ??couldn't you organize Mr. Petersen's wheelchair? - I can try. - He's sleeping now. Now use your talent for something sensible. - (there is a knock on the door) - Yes... Who is it? It's me...Ms. Emma. You might want to have Simba with you tonight. (Simba growls) - (Simba growls) - Simba! - (the parrot screams) - Ssshh. (quiet snoring) - Evening. How was the meeting? - Yeah, like those always go. - Aah...! - Sshh, you're waking up the whole house! Oh god, miss. Emma, ??is that you! Yes, yes, I'll probably be quiet. - G-good evening, Mr P-Petersen. - Good evening. We might as well live under the open sky. Well, it has helped somewhat. I'll ask Sorensen to look at it tomorrow. Goodnight. So here it is. But wheelchairs are not the easiest thing to have. How about you gentlemen chess masters? They neither hear nor see. They might as well be on the moon. - Where is the trip going? - The cooling box in the basement. - Black Queen F2 to F5. - What? Black Queen F2 to F5. Surely no one has seen his upper mouth? I'll put a violet rose all the way out on the edge of the shadow... - There where all the velvet runways... - Emma! Now I have to, Ms. Emma. Black Queen F2 to F5. (there is a knock on the door) (knocking again) Mother's little dog... come on, Simba. - (the glass knocks over) - Oh no, you pig! Oh, will you take care of the milk? Simba... come on, out with you. He knocked it over in sheer excitement. Ms. Johanne and Ms. Emma comes up here after morning coffee. I think that Ms. Johanne has a plan. - Bitten... - Yes? Bitten, come, sit here. I know it all, Betina. Has Ms. Johanne and Emma told you that? - Have you moved... - Yes. The cooling box. (there is a knock on the door) - Good morning. - I have driven Mr. Petersen up. Well, Betina, you look really nice today. Did you sleep well? Yes, I slept like a rock. Johanne, let's hear what will happen. Here we walk around with a killer, and you're sitting there steaming! First of all, we have to pretend it's nothing. No one must suspect that we have found Uncle Theodor. - If I suggested a body search? - There'll be 30 cops who wants to check the cooler! There will be no house inspection here. Nothing happened here. We have to know who the killer is! Then we'll find the motive. Until then, you are running a big risk, Betina. "Sorry, mr mystery. Did you murder Ms. Betina's uncle? And why have you done it?" Be quiet, Emma. Stop meddling unless you got ideas. - We need a dead man. - But we have that. - Not him, someone else. - Can you repeat that? - We'll need a dead guy. - Yes, they're hanging on the trees! What about Mr. Petersen? He is both old and is horrendous. He looks dreadful and he rolls around with one wheel in the grave. Emma, ??control yourself now! - (knocking) - Yes, come in. - Mr. Petersen... - Nah, is that you? Sucha good time. - Shall we look in? - I'm sorry if you don't... Oops, be careful Johanne. Electrical installations at ankle height. It would be a shame if we tumbled in them. - Why are you coming here? It's not a train station! - It is a courtesy visit. Good day... that was funny. Go ahead and come inside. - How are they? - I have never felt better. - Go ahead and sat you down. - Thank you, Mr. Petersen. - What are you up to? - Absolutely nothing. We wandered down the corridor, then my sister says: "I wonder how Mr. Petersen is?" "The nice old man," I say, "let's visit him." "We must be good to each other while we can." - I don't like chocolates! - Oh, I love chocolates. You can probably wait until you are offered! Chocolates are wrong. Mr. Petersen must not eat it. Does it taste good? - Have you seen the key to the cooler? - Nah. I've called around, but no one has seen him since yesterday. We must get him wanted. He has been away for almost 24 hours. Sorry, Ms. Eriksen... the key to the cooling box? - (the gong sounds) - Let's finish first. There is plenty for lunch. Make vegetables for dinner. I go in and call the police. Will you handle the lunch? I need some fresh air. Will you move Mr. Petersen's envelope down here to us? E4. - Are you playing l'hombre, Mr. Petersen? - No! - The Italian one, Johanne? - Thanks. - Bridge? - No. - Saw Canasta? Casino? - No! - Rummy or Black Peter? - No! Will you hand me the salt, Mr. Petersen? - Poker? - Uh... I knew it! Splendid game. Shall we play after lunch? Well, then we look inside the cave. Johanne, we are invited up to Mr. Petersen's. One moment, Emma. We are invited up to Mr. Petersen's place to play poker... Shouldn't I make a piece of the Italian for you? No, I don't like salads. Ms. Eriksen needed fresh air. She went for a walk... But I don't know where the others are. There is something wrong. Find Ms. Betina, hurry up. Bitten, take Simba with you. (she screams) - (Simba barks) - Betina! ... Betina! - (Simba growls) - Betina? Betina? Bitten, get Soerensen and a rope. And Bitten, hurry! - Bitten? - The view. I'll get a rope. - Betina! - Yes. - Are you hurt? - No, just a few scratches. Aah, thank God. That was good, Simba. About 1.62 meters. Blue eyes, gray tailored suit. - Dark tie, dark shoes. - Yes. They say he left his coat. Can I see it? I-I-it's hanging over there. Ms. Eriksen... can you put a noose around your body, yourself? No, I can't let go of my hands. I'm coming down. I go down to the beach with her. There is a staircase here. (stones fall) - Hello, can you handle this? - Yes. (more stones fall down) - So let go...Hold on. - Yes. Better go a little further. More may come down. - Thank you, Soerensen! - Yes, I am an old artist. How did you it happen? Walk into the fog? I must have gone too far... So extreme, so I was easy to push. - Then you were luckier than me. - Good day. This applies only to the search. They weren't seriously injured, were they? Ms. Eriksen only tripped and got a few scratches. Yes, 40 meters without net! So it wasn't to be this time. I came about your Uncle. Are you okay with a wanted notice? Then I won't trouble you anymore. Your cousin informed me. - That's excellent, little you. - Can I help with something? Don't talk about. They probably apologize for us being seated. - Of course. - Soerensen, follow our little officer up. Don't worry, Commissioner, I'm in good hands. Strange, that they have a problem getting when you don't need them. I was pushed out. If you tell the police everything, then you are the one who killed your Uncle. Or if you need anything else, take sleeping pills - - or jumps 40 meters down, then the evidence is finally proven. Ms. Johanne, what do you need a dead man for? No, I won't. You probably have enough by looking after yourself. Just strolling out... Ms. Betina has known this place since she was a child. It's not really believable. - 3 crowns. - 3.50. - 7.50. - 8. - 9.85. - God, it's like a sale! - 12. - 14. - Can I see? - Full house. Straight flush. - (it knocks) - Yes! Take a chair and sit down. They are welcome with a deposit. Aah, sorry, Mr. Petersen, I didn't think twice. - But you will probably allow us. - Cut. Well, mr. Petersen, what will it cost to be apart? 2 crowns. I raise. - They're bluffing. - Who... me? Nope. - One new. - Two. I don't want anything. - 25 cents. - 50. - 75. - 4 crowns. - 5. - May I see. - 10. - 20. - 20.50. - 22. - 24. - 25.25. - 26. - 26.50. 30. Now you shouldn't overestimate your cards. - 40. - Emma! - 40.25. - 40.50. Well, mr. Petersen, time for our shot. 41. 42. - 45.50. - 47. - 50. - 52. - 55. - 56. - 58. - 60. Your milk, Mr. Petersen. - 61. - You ruin your teeth, Emma! - 65. - 67. - 80. - 100. Can I see? 5 aces. So, Mr. Petersen, your milk. Look, isn't it going to be one of the most ravishing things? No, that's funny! "Why walk around and be half dead, when we bury you for 500 crowns." Sweet. He shouldn't be... No, he's just sleeping. Much work for nothing. No... he has been playing with marked cards! If it had happened in the States, he would have been cold by now. You shouldn't bemoan your luck. - Shall we take a little break? - Well, bring some life into him! It's harmless to see him lying there gathering strength! 5 Aces... (the gong sounds) Mr. Petersen? Awake then, you sour reprobate! Mr. Petersen! - Ms. Eriksen! - Yes, what is it, Elsa? Mr. Petersen... is completely cold. Dr. Joergensen is upstairs. Take care of dinner, Elsa. - Is he dead? - Yes. That was dreadful! The sweet old man. - Is he... - Yes. He quietly slept away. Any relatives? - No, he was all alone. - I'll write a death certificate. - Are you absolutely sure? - Yes, sure. You heard stories of people waking up again. He has apparently been away for a while. Close the door. What now? - Can you get a chest up here tonight? - Possibly, we are good customers. Good. Get him ready and put in the coffin. Book the funeral for tomorrow as early as possible. Then we have to hope that someone notices that we are busy. - Is he going to sleep here tonight? - Nah, he needs to be in the cooling box. No, Johanne, now you're losing it! Not at all. Shall we go down and eat? A bulletin. The 58 year old Theodor Eriksen - - disappeared yesterday from the Ellekilde rest home. He is about 168 cm, has blue eyes - is wearing a gray suit, dark tie and dark shoes. Please report information to the nearest police authority. The funeral will take place tomorrow at 10. I would appreciate that we met as many as possible. Mr. Petersen had neither family nor relatives. (there is a knock on the door) - Maybe I can finish my hat? -Yes, it certainly would fit the occasion. Good evening. Shall we go upstairs? Yes, it was nice of you to come on such a short notice. We are here for the same. King D1. Runner beats Jumper. Then we don't have to trouble you anymore, miss. Eriksen. We are so used to it. When we are done, we list off quite quietly. - Shall we screw the lid on? - No. Runner D7. Long cast. - I have informed the police. - About what, Dr. Joergensen? My toxin cabinet has been broken into and a bottle of scopolamine was removed. - Then we're done, miss. Eriksen. - Now I have to... Don't talk about. We can easily find out ourselves. Good night. Then it can't be Dr. Joergensen. If I should use scopolamine, I would break my own cabinet open too. Runner D2. Queen G8. Well, little children, let's see if we can get to bed. We go up to you. ... Are you coming, Emma? - Yes, good night. - Good night. F beats G. Is there anything we can do for you? No, enough has been done. Good night. - Go-o-night. - (Simba grunts) Elsa, will you ask Bitten to come up to me. (Simba grunts) Simba! Simba. Simba...Simba. Betina... Where did you hide your uncle? Betina... - Betina... - Yes? Do you want to bury him instead of Mr. Petersen? All I know is that Uncle Theodor has disappeared. You're lying, Betina. (the elevator goes upstairs) "Acid" (the elevator door goes up) (the sound of footsteps) Well, here you are. I went downstairs for a bottle of sherry. Will you take it to me? - Should it be the completely dry one? - Yes, please. - (both are startled) - (Simba growls) I guess we have to get Uncle Theodor up in Mr. Petersen's coffin. Yes... but only when there is complete peace in the house. - The wheelchair! - Yes, yes, yes. - Emma, ??get a better grip. - Where should I grab? - Grab it below the knees. - Yeah... uh... Come. Ah! Is that you, Mrs. Carlsen? They scared the hell out of us. We just got hungry and needed a bite to eat. Just jump into bed. We will be fine. So good night then. - Jumper D5 - Jumper beats jumper. - C beats jumper. - Runner D2. - F7 to F6 - Runner beats H7, check. - King beats Runner. - Springer G5, check. F hits jumper. - Queen H5, check. - King G2. - Tower H7. - Queen H1, check. - Jumper H4. - Lady beats springer, chess. - Queen beats Queen. - Runner F7, check mate! (a door slams in) Go away, Bitten. But stay with Ms. Betina. - Shouldn't I stay here? - No, we will arrange it ourselves. Remember, there must be peace in the house. I'm waiting for the killer. - You are a genius, Johanne. - Yes, get into the cabinet. - Am I going to be all alone in there? - No, take this with you. I stand behind the curtain. - Emma, ??can you see the coffin? - Yes, thank you, all too clear. If I gather, how do you come up with something like that. Shut up, Emma! I don't know whether to be proud of you or ashamed. (handle squeaks) (the door closes quietly) - Emma... Did you see him? - Yes! - I couldn't see who it was. - I could. Thanks. - Emma... the hat. - Pardon. - Now I have to. - Thanks. (the organ starts playing) Always safe when you go. ways God knows even if you reach the goal only at the end of the world forget everything you've loved... - Runner E7. - Short game. ... then life is not so difficult neither did the dead. - Well, we made it. - Yes, right on the minute. - Aah! - Emma! From earth you came to earth you shall remain but of earth you again will rise Amen. Sorry, but I must ask you to open the casket. You absolutely cannot do that without permission! Mr. Reverend, won't you convince our little officer there. They will have to show me a permit. We can wait. Ms. Eriksen, there is nothing new about your uncle. Not yet. Come. Runner H7 beats Jumper. Come on, Bitten. Sit down. Our friend has told the police that we have buried Uncle Theodor. Then we have him! He's the only one who knows that uncle is dead. He probably hasn't given up who he is. That means we have peace for him until tonight. The earliest the officer has the permission is in the afternoon. He cannot open the tomb until after dark. We are in a hurry, we have to get Uncle Theodor's will. - It is in Osby's office. - He's not dead yet... officially. - We can't ask him to... - We don't need to either. Right, Emma? - Shouldn't I come along? - No, Emma can do it alone. I have another task for you. - But, Emma, ??only the will. - Well, it was his... - Well...yeah, I'm pretty sure. - What are you looking for? Here! The lawyer's keys. I was afraid, they were stolen. Bitten, do you have a pair of dark slacks, sweater and gloves? Put it on, stay in your room, until I call you. The armchair is moved over with its back to the window. Cognac is served with the coffee. And Elsa can't remove the bottle. It must be on the table with 2 clean glasses. When the officer has his permit, you must meet for identification. Take Osby with you. It's comforting to have a lawyer. - If the police keep me? - They won't do that. Ask the officer to drive you and Osby home. Do you know how dead comes when you take scopolamine? No. Then I'll tell you ... after lunch. Springer C3. G6. - Aah... aah... - Well, Emma! Elsa, will you pick up my bag? - It's nothing serious. - I think I'm going to pass out. Move forward. Head well down. - Here you go. - Thanks. - How does it fair then? - It goes better now. - They were supposed to lay down. - Come on, I'll help you up. So, let me go then. I'll take care of this. - She grabbed my stethoscope. - And my keys are gone! What was that comedy for? Sometimes you're dumb. You ask me to break into a lawyer's office for a document, - - which is well stored in a steel box, which is equipped with a puzzle, - - which I look forward to solving with dr. Joergensen's stethoscope. Otherwise, I'm ready to go, no one will miss me. - When does a train leave? - 15.10. Then you take a carriage home! - Shall the lawyer pay it? - Oh, you silly body! That... How is Ms. Emma? Shall I go check on her? She's better, Doctor. Bitten looks at her. - (phone rings) - I'll take it myself, Elsa. Ellekilde... Yes, it's me. It was the police. They'll pick me up in fifteen minutes. I need to identify Mr. Petersen. - Are you coming with me? - Of course. Elsa, You can serve the coffee. Elsa, would you like to serve a cognac with the coffee? - Thanks for food. - Bon appetite. - D3. - F4. Thanks for food. Thanks for food. Elsa, leave the cognac. We'll probably need one when we come back. Myrdrian, Fullenberg & Schnuppelhauser. Runner D6. - Was there more tonight? - Nah, thanks. - So good night. - Good night. Wholesaler Theodor Eriksen was murdered. Yes, murdered here at Ellekilde - - inside Ms. Betina's office and with her paper knife. Later, the murderer hunted Ms. Betina for her life. Tha-that? Ms. Eriksen... It's Mr. Petersen. Will you drive us home, Mr. Police Commissioner? - Osby?! - Yes. You are gorgeous, Ms. Johanne. And very, very brave. Practical, Dr. Joergensen. I hope Emma finds the motive and the proof. Yes, gentlemen, shall we... Mr. Schnuppelhausser... Simba, Simba... (a door slams) (the clock strikes 12) Betina... cheers. Betina... (she drops the glass) "I hereby declare that I have taken my own life." "It was I, who murdered Uncle Theodor on May 13..." Good evening, Osby. I'm afraid you've made a fool of yourself. Move! Clever girl. Very nicely done. Bitten, will you hand over that glass? It probably needs analysis. Here's more of interest, little cop. And now, will you remove the lawyer there. He's certainly not decorating. - How about a cup of tea, dear child? - Of course, Johanne. I got it, I found it! Oh, how it is exciting with such a little break! Good evening, Commissioner... ... and Osby. Now you have to see. Thanks for lending. I have locked after me. Uh... Are you the killer? If you knew, how excited I was of which of you it was. Uncle Theodor has returned to honor and dignity! A little cup of tea? How nice. Here you go, Johanne. Late night tea and thunder coffee is the most romantic thing there is! Dr. Joergensen, here you have to see... and sorry. Another time you can just ask me for it. No, I didn't know if you were the murderer. So here we have the motive. Besides Betina and Gustav is thought of, it says,- - that the assets are to be administered by lawyer Osby. Yes, then we must hope that he has not screwed it all up. - Th-the--They forget to stutter! - Yes. What did Mr. Petersen die of? Have you noticed that spring is upon us? - Yes, the sirens have gone out. - And the golden rain. It's the time, I care the most at Ellekilde. (the ladies chatter) - Runner beats Tower. - Queen beats Runner. Johanne, are you joining the factory tomorrow? I have to make myself a new hat. G-g-good night. We've g-g-forgotten Uncle Theodor. Oh, save me! We have to return him to the cooler! (the dog barks) --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
