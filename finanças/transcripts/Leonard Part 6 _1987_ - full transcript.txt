[giggling] [squawks] [croaks] [rattling] [water bubbling] [burps] [trumpets] [whooping] [meowing] [laughing] [coughing] [growling] [barks] [car approaching] [explosion] THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATION, WHY LEONARD PARKER FOUND HIMSELF FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. ONE, IN AN ARMORED PORSCHE, 2, WEARING BALLET SLIPPERS, AND 3, ON THE BACK OF AN OSTRICH. ALL IN THE SPACE OF ONE WEEK IN SAN FRANCISCO. MR. PARKER, WHOM I HAVE THE HONOR TO SERVE, IS A MAN OF EXCEPTIONAL TALENTS, WHOSE 5 PREVIOUS ADVENTURES WOULD, I'M SURE, HAVE ENTHRALLED YOU, HAD THEY NOT BEEN CONFISCATED, IN THE INTERESTS OF WORLD SECURITY. IT ALL BEGAN UNDER THAT FAMOUS BRIDGE WITH A TEAM OF FROGMEN, NOT, I HASTEN TO ADD, ON OUR SIDE. [water bubbling] [water bubbling] [barking] QUINCY, THE WATER'S BEAUTIFUL. COME IN. COME IN. IT'S MAN RAY. QUELISH. [creaking] [barking] [barking] [growling] [squeaking] [barking] OH, QUINCY, STOP SPLASHING. [belching] [explosion] [laughing menacingly] THIS WAS, I BELIEVE, THE FIRST RECORDED INSTANCE, OF A C.I.A. AGENT BEING EATEN ALIVE BY A RAINBOW TROUT. AND WORSE WAS TO COME. (Jack) WE'VE LOST 8 AGENTS THIS MONTH. BUT HOW DO WE STRIKE BACK AGAINST FEROCIOUS FISH? WE BLOW 'EM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. WE'VE GOT THE CAPABILITY. I HOPE YOU KNOW I SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT PASSION, JACK, BUT WE CAN'T. WE'VE GOT TO LEARN THEIR SECRET, AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT. ABOVE ALL, WE MUSTN'T PANIC. OH, YES, WE MUST. IF SAN FRANCISCO GOES, TOMORROW IT'LL BE OREGON. AND THEN, THE REST OF THE WORLD. IN MY LIFETIME, I'VE ONLY WORKED WITH ONE MAN WHO CAN MATCH THE BRUTALITY AND HEINOUS WIT THAT'S BEHIND THESE SORDID AND UNPATRIOTIC EXECUTIONS. MR. SNYDERBURN, YOU DON'T MEAN-- YES. HE RETIRED. HE'LL NEVER COME BACK. HE'LL COME BACK. I'LL SEND MONROE TO GET HIM. [people chattering] (man) MMM. THAT LOOKS WONDERFUL. (Monroe) LEONARD. (Frayn) RETIREMENT BORED MR. PARKER. AND HIS ENORMOUS WEALTH GAVE HIM LITTLE CONSOLATION. AS A DIVERSION, HE OPENED A RESTAURANT, WHICH NATURALLY BECAME SAN FRANCISCO'S FINEST. YES, MR. MONROE? I'M AFRAID IT ISN'T FRESH. UH, WHAT ISN'T FRESH, SIR? THE TROUT IS NOT FRESH. OH, BUT, SIR, WE--WE KEEP OUR FISH LIVE IN A TANK. OH. WELL, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D SHOW ME THE TANK. OH, I'D BE HAPPY TO. FOLLOW ME. [people chattering] SO HERE IT IS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT TROUT. WOULD YOU PREFER THE FLOUNDER? DON'T GIVE ME THAT! I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THIS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS GONNA DO FOR MY CAREER, ELIMINATING THE NUMBER ONE AGENT IN THE WESTERN WORLD? BUT I'M NOT THE NUMBER ONE AGENT. I RETIRED 7 YEARS AGO. YEAH, THAT'S NOT WHAT NICK SNYDERBURN SAYS. SNYDERBURN? NOW DON'T BE NERVOUS, NOW. OH, I'M NOT NERVOUS, YOU KNOW. AH, CREPES FLAMBE! [bullets ricocheting] MAKE SPAGHETTI, SCOTTY. [machine whirring] [gun firing] [glass shattering] AH. [metallic clanking] [chefs chattering] MORE BUTTER. [people chattering] (Leonard) GO EASY, MONROE. [bullets ricocheting] [ricocheting continues] [grunting] [door opening] LEONARD! GOOD TO SEE YOU! [thudding] WHY... WHY DID YOU SEND MONROE TO KILL ME? SUPPOSE MONROE HAD GOTTEN LUCKY AND KILLED ME. THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RIGHT FOR THE JOB. SIT DOWN. [squelching] LEONARD, YOU KNOW JEFFERSON HERE. [squelching] AND, LIGHTS! [switches clicking] ALL TOGETHER AGAIN. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. [clicking] PUT THEM BACK ON. AND, LIGHTS! STIMOLA MEAT COMPANY, CADNA, ILLINOIS. [clicking] A GROUP OF HIGHLY TRAINED HOUSE CATS ASSAULTED ONE OF OUR AGENTS IN THE GRISTLE ROOM, COVERING HIM WITH FUR BALLS, KILLING HIM AND, UH, BURNING HIS I.R.S. RECORDS. MALFORD WILSON, VIRGINIA. HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM, ASSAULTED ON STATE ROAD 306 BY 18 SQUIRRELS, AND LEFT FOR DEAD, WHICH, OF COURSE, THEY WERE. WORST OF ALL, RIGHT IN THIS AREA, AN AS YET UNKNOWN NUMBER OF APPARENTLY FURIOUS GOPHERS, ATTACKED AND KILLED OUR UNDERCOVER COOK. THIS IS THE WORK OF A SINGLE, HEINOUS ORGANIZATION, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A MANIACAL, AND SADISTIC WOMAN. SHE'S A VEGETARIAN, A FORMER ECOLOGIST, AND SHE'S BENT ON TAKING OVER THE WORLD. AND, LIGHTS! [clicking] [squelching] (Jack) THIS HEINOUS WOMAN HAS DEVELOPED A FORMULA WHICH CAN CONTROL THE VERY MIND OF EVERY ANIMAL, FISH, BIRD, REPTILE, AND INSECT ON THIS GLOBE. AND WE HAVE JUST LEARNT THAT IN THE NEXT 36 TO 72 HOURS, THIS PARAPSYCHOTIC TYRANT PLANS TO LAUNCH AN ALL-ANIMAL OFFENSIVE OF MAJOR PROPORTIONS AGAINST THE BAY AREA. [Snyderburn] LEONARD. YOU GOTTA COME BACK WITH US. (Frayn) MR. PARKER HAD ALWAYS EXPECTED THAT ONE DAY HE WOULD HEAR ONCE MORE THE CLARION CALL OF DUTY. BUT NEVER IN HIS WILDEST NIGHTMARES DID HE IMAGINE THAT HE'D BE ASKED TO PIT HIS RESOURCES AGAINST FEROCIOUS FELINES AND HOMICIDAL SQUIRRELS. THAT VERY MORNING, I HAD TAKEN A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ASKING MR. PARKER TO CALL BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THAT CALL AND THIS MEETING COULD HARDLY BE UNCONNECTED. FACED WITH THIS KIND OF PRESSURE, HOW COULD HE SAY NO? NO. WE NEED YOU, LEONARD. YOU DON'T NEED ME. YOU NEED THE A.S.P.C.A. WE'LL PAY YOUR REGULAR FEE. $6 MILLION. WHY DON'T YOU JUST BLOW HER UP? WELL, YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING I'D RATHER DO THAN THAT. BUT WE CAN'T. WHAT SHE'S GOT COULD BE USEFUL TO US. NO. BUT WHY NOT, DAMN IT? I HAVE MY REASONS. OH, YEAH. HIS WIFE. HE QUIT THIS ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD GET HIS WIFE BACK. BUT WHAT HAPPENED? SHE WON'T EVEN RETURN YOUR PHONE CALLS. SHE NEEDS TIME. IT'S BEEN 7 YEARS. 7 YEARS, A LIFELESS DRUDGE. DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT COMING BACK WITH US MIGHT JUST WIN HER BACK. [squelching] MONROE! YOU KNOW, LEONARD, MY DEAREST FRIEND, JUST LOOK AT YOU. IT'S NO WONDER THAT GORGEOUS AND VOLUPTUOUS CREATURE DOESN'T WANT YOU AROUND ANYMORE. THAT'S ENOUGH, SNYDERBURN. WELL, YOU'RE MY DEAREST FRIEND AND-- YOU'RE NOT REMOTELY MY DEAREST FRIEND. AND I HAVE A KIWI TART THAT DEMANDS MY IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. I KNEW IT. WE'RE ALL GONERS. [squelching] OH, SHUT UP, MADISON. [door slams] (Frayn) IT'S TRUE THAT MR. PARKER WOULD HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING TO BE RECONCILED WITH HIS WIFE. HE EVEN GAVE UP THE SERVICE. HIS WIFE THOUGHT INTELLIGENCE WORK MEANT RUNNING AROUND THE WORLD, JUMPING INTO BED WITH A LOT OF BLONDE PEOPLE. SO HE GAVE IT UP, HOPING ONE DAY SHE WOULD RETURN. [Leonard sighing] DID SHE CALL? NO, SIR. SORRY, SIR. WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, FRAYN. OH, I CAN SEE MY DAUGHTER'S HERE AGAIN. THAT'S NOT THE HALF OF IT, SIR. DADDY! HI, HONEY! [both laughing] OK, NOW WHAT ARE YOU AND YOUR MOTHER FIGHTING ABOUT? NOTHING. NOTHING. HUH? ALL RIGHT, NOW WHAT DID YOU DO? WELL, SHE STILL REFUSES TO ALLOW ME TO EXPRESS MYSELF. AND SHE MAY NOT EVEN COME TO THE OPENING NIGHT. HMM. BUT I KNOW YOU'LL BE THERE ON THURSDAY, RIGHT, DADDY? NO, YOUR FATHER WILL BE THERE BEFORE THE STAGEHANDS ARRIVE. SEE, I KNEW YOU WOULD. AND I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS PLAY, DADDY. I JUST KNOW IT'S GONNA MAKE ME A STAR. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? HMM. YOU-YOU'RE GOING STEADY WITH THE LEADING MAN. THE DIRECTOR. AND DADDY, HE IS WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. HE'S WONDERFUL? AND HE'S IN THE DRAWING ROOM. IN THE DRAWING ROOM. COME ON. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM. OK. (Joan) MMM-HMM. WONDERFUL. DADDY, MEET GIORGIO FRANCOSI. CIAO, LEONARD. A PLEASURE. IS THIS WHAT YOU HAD A FIGHT WITH YOUR MOTHER ABOUT? DADDY. WELL, HE'S NOT STAYING HERE, EITHER. I'D NEVER BE SO PRESUMPTUOUS. I ONLY WANTED TO MEET THE FAMOUS FATHER, OF THE BRILLIANT WOMAN WHO STOLE NOT ONLY MY HEART BUT WHO'S ABOUT TO STEAL THE HEART OF ALL SAN FRANCISCO. BY FRIDAY MORNING, REZAZI BENZUR SHAHEED PARKER WILL BE A STAR. WHO IS THAT? THAT'S MY STAGE NAME. IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS, THIS WOMAN HAS GROWN FROM A CALLOW, INSENSITIVE CHILD TO A MATURE-- JOANIE, GET YOUR FATHER A SANDWICH AND SOMETHING COLD TO DRINK. NOW, PLEASE. WHAT IS THIS? UH, WHAT--WHAT-- WHAT'S GOING ON? WE'RE IN LOVE. WE'RE GOING TO GET MARRIED. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. RIGHT. SHE'S 2O YEARS OLD. RIGHT. AND YOU'RE 65? 66. I DON'T WANT A 66-YEAR-OLD SON-IN-LAW. YOU'RE ROBBING THE CRADLE. YOU BENT ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW? SOME SAY JOAN IS ROBBING THE GRAVE. [coughing] WELL, I'M NOT PAYING FOR THE WEDDING. HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING? HERE, DADDY. DADDY, LOOK AT THIS FACE. MY LITTLE CANNOLI. [speaking Italian] WHAT, UH, DID YOUR MOTHER SAY? [speaking Italian] YOU THINK I SHOULD I CALL HER? HMM? [bumping] FRAYN! GOOD NIGHT, UH, SERGIO. HUH? FATHER, IT'S GIORGIO. WHATEVER IT IS YOU BROUGHT IN HERE, GOOD NIGHT. CIAO. YES. LEONARDO. YOU STAY. YOU STAY! SIT DOWN. GOOD NIGHT, SOMETHING SPECIAL. [door closing] COULDN'T YOU HAVE FOUND SOMEBODY 45 YEARS OLD? THIS MAN IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE MY FATHER. MUST YOU INTERFERE IN MY LIFE, DADDY? YOU'RE JUST LIKE MOTHER. SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT I REALLY WANT TO BE AN ACTRESS. AND BEING AN ACTRESS IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE. WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE YOUR MOTHER, BECAUSE A MONTH AGO, YOU WANTED TO BE A SCULPTOR FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. A MONTH BEFORE THAT, YOU WANTED TO BE A BUDDHIST FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. AND A MONTH BEFORE THAT, YOU BOUGHT, UH, LUGGAGE. THAT'S TRUE. AND NO OFFENSE, DADDY, BUT I JUST DON'T WANNA BE IN JUST THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS. I NEED TO EXPRESS MYSELF, AND I NEED TO EXPERIENCE LIFE AT ITS MOST RAW. MOTHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THIS. NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A WEDDING, AND THEN MAYBE A WEEK LATER, I'M GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR A FUNERAL. (Frayn) MEANWHILE, ACROSS THE CITY, ANOTHER FUNERAL WAS IMMINENT. OUTSIDE THE HEADQUARTERS OF INTERNATIONAL TUNA, C.I.A. OPERATIVE CHARLES POLK WAS KEEPING SURVEILLANCE. [electrical sparking] [alarm bell ringing] MEDUSA! MEDUSA! GOVERNMENT AGENT ON PIER ONE. GOVERNMENT AGENT ON PIER ONE. WHO HAS THE NERVE TO CALL? [machine humming] KILL HIM. OF COURSE, MY BELOVED ANDY, KILL HIM.

TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT, SIR, EVEN IF THE GIRL WAS ONLY 19. WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. BUT TO BE FAIR, SIR, MRS. PARKER DID FIND THE TWO OF YOU NAKED IN THE SAUNA, SWITCHING EACH OTHER WITH BIRCH LEAVES.

LEONARD, THIS IS A DIAGRAM OF THE SPHERE. [electronic beeping] HOW'D HE GET ON THIS TAPE? (Snyderburn) IT'S THE NERVE CENTER OF THEIR OPERATION. IT CONTROLS THE ANIMALS' BEHAVIOR. THE SPHERE IS GUARDED NIGHT AND DAY BY UNKNOWN FORCES IN A ROOM WHICH I CALL B. YOU'LL ISOLATE AND RETRIEVE THE SPHERE AT THIS POINT B. WE NEED THIS SPHERE, LEONARD. YOU CAN DO IT. COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT. I THINK YOU CAN DO IT. (Frayn) IT'S ALL A QUESTION OF ATTITUDE, SIR. I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN DO THIS. ? POSITIVE ? YOU SHOULD KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS ? POSITIVE, POSITIVE ?

HE'D WAITED 7 YEARS FOR THIS EVENING, SO HE'D LEFT NOTHING TO CHANCE. HE WAS WEARING THE PERFECT SUIT, CARRIED THE PERFECT FLOWERS, AND IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF, HAD CHOSEN THE PERFECT TIE. WHEN THEY'D SEPARATED, HE HAD MOVED AWAY AS FAR AS HE FELT HE POSSIBLY COULD. I LEFT HIM ALONE WITH HIS THOUGHTS DURING THE AGONIZING RIDE TO HER HOUSE. ALL THE BEST, SIR. [doorbell chiming] GOOD EVENING, SIR. MADAM IS EXPECTING YOU. THE STAFF AND I WOULD LIKE TO WISH YOU GOOD LUCK, SIR. THANK YOU. WALK THIS WAY, SIR. OH, SIR, HOW WE'VE ALL MISSED YOU.

I'VE COUNTED THE MINUTES, TOO, LEONARD. I WAS SO EXCITED T0 SEE YOU TONIGHT. GOOD. THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US THAT SOMETIMES I FEEL WE'VE ALMOST BECOME STRANGERS. TONIGHT IS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDY ALL THAT. YES. OH, YES. OH. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M SO SORRY. IT WILL COME OUT. I WAS HOPING THAT TONIGHT WE COULD PUT THE PAST BEHIND US. EXACTLY. YOU KNOW, LEONARD, I'VE NEVER LOVED ANYONE AS MUCH AS I LOVED YOU, AND IT WAS PAINFUL, EXTREMELY PAINFUL WHEN THAT INCIDENT OCCURRED. WELL, YEAH, IT WAS PAINFUL FOR ME AS WELL, BUT, I MEAN, THAT'S BEHIND US. THAT'S THE PAST. I MEAN, YOU SAID IT. THAT'S-- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID. LEONARD, I KNOW WHAT I SAID, BUT I'M HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE NOT REMEMBERING YOU WITH HER. EVERY TIME I SEE YOUR FACE, I SEE THAT 19-YEAR-OLD. I--I UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

FRAYN, TAKE ME TO SEE NURSE CARVALHO. BUT WE NEVER SEE THE NURSE UNLESS WE'RE GOING TO WORK. NURSE CARVALHO. CERTAINLY, SIR. (Frayn) THIS LATEST PERSONAL DISASTER WAS AT LEAST SALVATION FOR THE WESTERN WORLD. AGENT LEONARD PARKER WAS RETURNING TO THE FIELD. BEFORE ANY ASSIGNMENT, MR. PARKER ALWAYS CONSULTED NURSE CARVALHO, [drums beating] AN ALBANIAN FORTUNETELLER, WHO NOW LIVED IN A TRAILER PARK IN OAKLAND. HE TRUSTED HER EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD A SINGLE WORD SHE SAID. YES. (Leonard) HOW ARE YOU, NURSE? [nurse speaking foreign language] [both chuckling] IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. [speaking foreign language] I'VE DECIDED TO GO BACK TO WORK.

PARKER WHO'D WORKED UNDERCOVER WITH THE BOLSHOI BALLET IN MOSCOW FOR OVER 3 YEARS. AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT, THIS EXPERIENCE WOULD PROVE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN HIS FIREPOWER.

[bumping] LEONARD, LEONARD, WHY DON'T YOU GO IN THERE AND TALK TO JOAN RIGHT NOW? PLEASE, DEAR, PLEASE DON'T ASK ME TO TALK, ESPECIALLY TO HER. PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. I WILL. [thumping] (Frayn) WHEN YOU'VE SURVIVED VICIOUS VEGETARIANS AND TAKEN A BULLET FROM YOUR SHOULDER, YOU DON'T NEED YOUR DAUGHTER FLAUNTING HER FULL FRONTAL CHARMS TO AN AUDIENCE OF STRANGERS. IT WAS TIME TO ASSERT HIS PARENTAL AUTHORITY. [mumbling] THEY'VE GOT MOM! A WEIRD GUY WITH RED HAIR TOOK HER AWAY. [Joan sobbing] DON'T WORRY. I'LL GET HER BACK. THEY GOT MRS. PARKER. WE GOT TO GET THE SPHERE. PUT THE FOOT TO THE GAS. THERE'S GOT TO BE A SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE THIS THING WORK. I NEED THAT SPHERE. ONE COULD RULE THE WORLD WITH THIS THING. [beeping] IT ISN'T ENOUGH WE HAVE TO STOP HER FROM CONTROLLING THE ANIMALS. HE WANTS TO CONTROL THE ANIMALS. IT'S NOT ON, SIR. NO. I KNEW WE WOULD NEVER GET THIS TO WORK. HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING, TEAM? LEONARD, WE CAN'T STILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS THING TO WORK. OH, REALLY? THE RED LIQUID NEUTRALIZES THE ANIMAL'S PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM, LEAVING THE BRAIN PAN FLACCID AND OPEN TO ENCRYPTION, BUT THE PUZZLE IS HOW DID THIS WOMAN ACTIVATE THEM? (Leonard) MAYBE YOU HAVE THE WRONG RABBIT. I KNEW WE GOT THE WRONG RABBIT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. FRAYN? UH-HUH. (Leonard) MAYBE IT'S THIS ONE. COME HERE, FELLA. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. UH, YOU ALL STEP OVER THERE. NOW STEP OVER THERE. AND LET'S SEE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK HERE. NOW, DID YOU GIVE IT THE LIQUID? (Jack) SURE. AND IT'S ALL ACTIVATED THERE? WELL, I THINK THE ONLY THING MISSING HERE IS TO SAY THE WORD QUELISH! [all screaming] NOW, LET'S SEE MEDUSA AND GET BACK MRS. PARKER. [groaning] [beeping] OPEN THAT THING UP. IN HERE, SIR?
