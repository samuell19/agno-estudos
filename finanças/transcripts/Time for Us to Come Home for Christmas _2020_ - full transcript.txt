I just came from the courthouse. The judge found in your favor. The property owner can't raise your rent under the signed agreements. We won? Yes. Congratulations. My grandfather opened this store. We've been here for 50 years. I couldn't imagine starting somewhere new. And now you won't have to. I can't thank you enough for helping us, Sarah. I... I know how difficult these last few months have been. It's what she would have wanted. Your mother was a wonderful woman. Here you go. Best of the batch. putting up a tree this year. Please. It's on the house. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Uh... I'm happy to hear that things went well for you in court today. Was that the last of your mother's cases? Uh, yes, there's just one more to wrap up. Hang on. I can't hear you very well. I thought there were four outstanding cases. There... there were, but May Palmer was having trouble with one of the community center's annual grants, and my mother usually walked her through them. My mother had a lot of people who really depended on her. Well, I don't want you to feel like we're rushing you back. No, I've got a few buyers already lined up for the house, so I think I should be back in Seattle by January. Walter, thank you so much for allowing me to extend my family leave. You've got a bright future with this firm, Sarah, if it's where you want to be. Oh, of course it is. Well, I'm happy to hear that. It's admirable what you're doing, taking care of your mother's affairs like this. I just hope you take some time for yourself as well. Have you got plans for the holidays? Are you seeing family? No, just a... a quiet Christmas. Well, I wish you a very Merry Christmas. Yes, Merry Christmas, Walter. Oh, and Sarah? Keep an eye out. The firm has sent you a little something, a gift. Thank you. "Spend Christmas with us." ♪ There's music in the city ♪ ♪ And the lights are on display ♪ ♪ There's a big old tree ♪ ♪ For all to see ♪ ♪ Where the children run and play ♪ ♪ I look out through my window ♪ ♪ Something just don't seem right ♪ ♪ Until I said hello... ♪ Walter, it's Sarah. I just got to the inn, and it is so beautiful. Thank you so much for the thoughtful gift. It's exactly what I needed. Do you... Do you need a hand? I travel light. Thank you! Oh! This is my first vacation in years, and I didn't know what to pack, so I just packed everything. I'm Karen. Sarah. Thank you so much. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Isn't this beautiful? Oh, it sure is. Welcome to the Snowfall Inn. Hi, I'm Karen Barton. I called yesterday. Oh, yes, Miss Barton. Your room is ready. Right up those stairs. Thank you. So nice meeting you. Enjoy your holiday. Thank you. You too. Hello. Sarah Thomas. Welcome to Snowfall Inn. Have you stayed with us before? No. This is my first time. You're in for a real treat. Our Christmas party brings the whole town out. Here you go, Miss Thomas. Room four. Oh, wonderful. Thank you. Are you sure you haven't stayed with us before? You're very familiar. Uh, no. Just one of those faces, I guess. That must be it. Thanks. All right, so Grammy's got the gingerbread in the oven. It'll be waiting for us when we get there. I want to hear the clock. Daddy said it plays a song. Oh, I'm sorry, honey, but the clock plays on the hour, and we've got to get on the road. Oh, that's your dad now. Okay, mittens, too. It's cold out there. Shh. Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Ready to go? -Let's go tell Dad. -Okay. So, should I tell the kitchen our dinner guests are gonna be 20 minutes early tonight? Oh, uh, sorry. I'm kidding. I've moved it forward more times than I can count. I'm Ben. Sarah. You said "our guests." So are you the... Owner. And manager, and, uh, current maintenance man. How do you fit all that on one single business card? Can I help you find some books? We've sure got a lot around here. No, I was just... I was just looking, browsing. This was a holdover from the previous owner. Mm. Let's see, uh... Oh, here we go. A Christmas Carol? Have you read it? I mean, everyone's read A Christmas Carol. No. Actually, everyone thinks they've read it because they've seen one of the countless movie adaptations, so... have you read it? Actually... I haven't. So you'll give it a try? Yeah, maybe I will. Okay. Ben? Do you have a moment? Well, I better get back to work. All right. See you later. Thank you. Hello. No way. Sis? Surprise. Oh, my gosh! Come here! Mm! I thought I was picking you up from the airport. Yeah, I caught an earlier flight. I thought I'd surprise you. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Come here. Martha, this is my sister, Bess. It is so nice to finally meet you. Yeah, you too. Ben tells me that you both stayed here as children. Every Christmas. Yeah. It's true. Snowfall Inn. I can't wait to show you what I've done with the place. -It looks amazing. -Yeah? -Ben? It's the caterers. -Yep? They need to confirm the desserts for the party. As soon as I take this call? Yeah. -And sis? -Yeah? -Room eight. -Love it. Yeah? Could you look up... -Hi. -Hey. Looks like we're neighbors. Yeah, looks like. Merry Christmas, neighbor. I'm Jasper. I'm Sarah. That's a lovely name. Thank you. Are you a musician? Are you in town for a show or something? No, I'm just here for the holidays. A gift from my wife. Aw, lucky guy. Very. Very. All right, so, picture the photo booth over there... -Mm-hmm. Okay. -All right? And this entire wall full of lights. Hmm? Wow. Yeah. And you'll never guess who I got to play at our party. The Jingle Belle Sisters? The Jingle Belle Sisters! Yeah! -What? -Isn't that incredible? -Wow. -Yeah, I know. Sounds like things are going really well. You know... buying this inn was the best decision I've ever made. I'm glad to hear that. I've been, uh, kind of worried about you. Why? Bess, I needed a change. Most people just get a haircut. It was a good investment, and it was a smart play. Is that all it was? Bess, you gotta trust me. Okay. Oh! Are you gonna have the gingerbread men? The ones with the... ...the peppermint... ...icing! I forgot about that! Thank you. I'm gonna write it down on my list here. Very important. Well, I'm happy to pitch in, anything you need. Bess, I did not invite you here to work. You are my guest. I know. It just feels like a lot for one person. And nothing I can't handle. Mm. Mm. Sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you, I was just... First thing I've eaten since lunch. So? Uh, it's good. Just "good"? No, I mean, it's very good. Thank you for the recommendation. It's my pleasure. You know, you can add "concierge" to your growing list of job titles. Oh, I think I wear too many hats as it is. I may never eat pie again. So, um, why did you come to town? Are you here visiting your family for the holidays? No. It's just me. Well, maybe you'd like to join us for some of our Christmas events. Here is our itinerary, actually. Guaranteed to make your holidays merry and bright. Oh, is that so? -Mm-hmm. -Hmm. Okay. Tree trimming, nice. Ornament decorating... Yeah. We have our guests paint their favorite memory of the year on an ornament, then the next Christmas, when they hang it up on the tree, they can relive the moment. No? Not so sentimental, huh? What? No. It just, uh... My mom used to do the same thing every Christmas. I didn't realize anyone else did that. Yeah, it's been a tradition here since I've been coming to Snowfall every Christmas. And how long ago was that? Um... ...years ago. Ahem. That long, huh? Yeah. Wow. And now you own it? And now I own it, yeah. So did you grow up around here? Maine, actually. I'm not sure how my family found it, but they fell in love with the town. Loved the Christmas celebrations and, uh, well, we started coming to the Snowfall Inn every Christmas, and then, when I found out it was for sale, I made an offer right away before I could change my mind. I know it's, uh, it seems a little impulsive, doesn't it? Now, that's an understatement. You know, I just... I couldn't stand the thought of someone else buying it and changing everything that made it so special. Mm. It's getting late. I should probably go. Hmm. Well, our ornament event is tomorrow. So, uh, maybe I'll see you there? Yeah, maybe. Yeah. All right. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Is there anything else you need before I head out? Hi. Thank you. Tch. You have a good flight, okay? It's just a few slow months. It'll turn around. Yeah, I'm sure you're right. Well, at least we're pretty full for Christmas. That's true. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Hi, Sarah. It's Walter. I'm sorry I missed your call. I'm glad to hear you're taking some time for yourself, but I'm afraid there's been some misunderstanding. We didn't send you an invitation to any inn. All right. I'm sorry, I've got to go. I'll try you again when I have a moment. Merry Christmas. Thanks for holding. Yes. Okay, just to confirm, that's one bedroom for two nights? Yep. Okay. You're all set. You have yourself a Merry Christmas. All right. Bye-bye. You were two days behind. Yeah. It's been one of those weeks. Can I help you with something? Is Martha around? No. She's actually off until the New Year. She's spending Christmas with her parents. Oh, nice. I, uh, I just had a question about my reservation. Sure. What can I find out for you? Who made it? Run that by me again? I received this card in the mail, confirming my reservation at the inn, and, uh, I assumed my office sent it, but they didn't. Didn't it have a return address? Yeah, no. It's right there. It says it's from the inn. Wow. Oh, we certainly didn't send this. It shouldn't be hard to get to the bottom of this. Let's see here. All right, there we go. Sarah Thomas... -Mm-hmm? -Huh. What? Well, the "reservation" line is blank. Must be an oversight. Did... Did they pay by card? Yeah, but, um, the computer encrypts the number, and doesn't show the billing information. They must've paid by a prepaid card. And you wouldn't happen to remember the reservation? No. Martha handles these, usually. -And she's not here. -No. Right. Do you have any idea who would get you a gift like this? Uh... this big? No, not off the top of my head. Looks like you've got yourself a Secret Santa. Thank you. Hi. Sit down. I'm having so much fun with the ornaments. Here. There's a clear one for you. Oh, thank you. All right. Paint our favorite memory. I'm not used to such a quiet Christmas. Normally, I'd spend it with my husband's family, a crowded house full of chaos, and it was heavenly. Why did you decide to spend this Christmas here? Oh, we divorced earlier this year. Oh. I'm so sorry. No, don't be. I've made my peace with it. We weren't meant to be after all. It's just hard at the holidays, you know, being alone, and... Oh, my goodness. Look at me prattle on. You probably have no idea what I'm talking about. No, I actually do. Honestly, this year has been a lot. I suppose I came up here to... kind of hide away from all of it for a bit. Mm-hmm. Hi. How are you doing? Well, as promised. Oh... Goes fast around here, you know. I'm so glad you came. Yeah. You talked me into it. So how's your stay been so far? Oh, it's been wonderful. Do you know I think I'm even booked into the same room that I had last time? Oh, you've stayed here before? Oh, it must have been, what, 30 years ago? Nice. Is that an apple? Yes, it is. Just before Thanksgiving break, I mentioned to my students that I love to bake apple pies for the holidays. The next day, each and every one of them brought an apple for my desk. What's your happy memory? Still thinking. Well, too many to choose from, I guess. Yeah. Hey. Merry Christmas. Hi. Merry Christmas. Wow. This hotel is lit, right, hon'? What? The hotel. It's lit, right? Really, Dad? Hey, Cass! The white stuff is really coming down right now. You won't see this in Southern California. The weatherman said that we can expect at least six... inches. And that's a good thing? Yeah! Snowmen? Snowballs? Snow angels? Mom said you grew up around here. Yeah. Yeah, my grandparents lived nearby, and I went to med school in Hartford, which is only a train ride away, so yeah, I guess it's a home away from home. Far away. Look. I know that this Christmas is a little different than what you're used to, but it's going to be great, I promise. I'm gonna go check out my room. Mrs. Blodgett. I've told you, my friends call me "Frenchie." -Frenchie. -How have you been? Are you checking up on me? Well, it is your first Christmas here, and I know better than anyone, every day is a new day at the inn. New challenges. Keeps you on your toes. Well, I appreciate that, but I think I've got it all under control. Yeah... May I? Uh... sure. Okay. Now, that... that was my next move. I was going through my decorations, and I found this. Thought you might like it. Must've gotten mixed in with my personal items during the move. No, no, no. You need to save this for your own tree. No. For 35 years, she watched over the inn. It's where she belongs. Thank you. Front desk. Uh, it's... can you hold on one moment? I'll let you get on with your work. Just... I meant to ask, is there any way to track down who made a reservation, if it was for a gift? A gift? Yeah. Blank reservation line, no phone number. Sounds to me like the giver doesn't wish to be found. Yeah. Have you ever had anything like this happen when you ran the inn? A few. Christmas tends to bring out a certain generosity. Ah. Well, thanks again. You're coming to the Christmas party, right? Ho, ho, ho! Wouldn't miss it at all! All right. Thanks for holding. Come in. Hi. Oh. Thank you. I like to sleep with the windows open. It's no trouble. Just put it right there. That's fine, thanks. Is that, uh... My wife. She's got a smile that could light up a whole room. Yeah, I believe it. Is that Coney Island? Yeah. It's the night before I left for three months on the road. Our first date. Yeah. 40 cities later, that picture never left my pocket. Wow. Well, if you need anything, just, uh, you let me know. Okay? I will. Thank you. All right. And you're sure it was the same card? Looks identical to yours. Do you know Jasper? No. I met him two days ago. It's... oh, it's so strange. Well, if you want to speak to him directly, the van leaves in 15 minutes. Van to where? Oh, you'll find out. Lots of Christmas trees. Okay. Okay, everybody. Bevington Tree Farms has been hosting its holiday fair for nearly 50 years. Now, I humbly recommend their Christmas pudding for anyone with a sweet tooth. I'm lookin' at you, Ms. Potter. It must be a coincidence. H-He said that he checked your reservation, and the line was blank, just like mine. My wife made my arrangements. Are you sure? I'm sorry. You must be mistaken. Sarah? Aren't you coming? I saved a seat in the front for you. Yeah. Who's that? It's nothing. Just a friend from school. Hey! We should take our pictures and post it. Hey, Cass. Pick your elf. I'm good, Dad. Hey, you know what? I think I see a hot chocolate stand over there. What do you say, kiddo? Double marshmallows? Sure. Hello? Oh, thank you very much. Merry Christmas. Oh, hey, guys. How are you? Good, good. You guys good? Yeah, I'm great, thank you. Do you remember my friend, Caroline? Two please, with whipped cream. She just moved back to the area. Newly single. Bess, I am not looking for a relationship right now. Well, you don't have to look. It's not a good time. It's been a year, Ben. I know you were hurt, but don't you think you should get back out there? You've seen how busy I am with the inn. Is that by design? I'm doing fine on my own. -Okay. -Thank you. Come on. Is Grandma with you? We're heading out to pick up some ribbons for the Christmas wreaths. She's insisting we make the bows ourselves. I wish I was there. I'm sure your dad has lots of fun things planned for you. Oh, sweetheart, I need to go. Miss you lots. Miss you, too. Love ya. Hey, hon'. Hey, Dad. They ran out of marshmallows, so I got extra whipped cream. Thanks, Dad. Thank you. I've always been partial to the blue spruce. -Is that for the inn? -Yeah. I need one for our tree trimming. Blue spruce, huh? Yeah. So what did you do before you bought the inn? I was in finance. Ahem. Wall Street. Really? You don't seem the type. Oh, because I am not. I was miserable tied to a desk all day. And now you're here. In flannel. What? You think I'm crazy. No. Well, you wouldn't be the only one. My sister thought I was kidding when I told her. I had to show her the paperwork before she believed me. So what do you do? I'm a lawyer. -Oh... -Don't hold it against me. Why law? My mother. She had a small practice in Brooklyn, mostly social-interest litigation, but her doors were... were always open to anyone who needed it. A champion of the underdog, huh? Yeah, a whole borough's worth, and I wanted to fight that fight by her side. So you two work together? No. That was the plan, you know, to practice with her, um, to be a team. But right out of law school, I was offered a job at a really big firm in Seattle, and it just seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up, and she agreed. She practically bought me the plane ticket. Do you like it? It's... It's different. It's mostly trade disputes and corporate mergers. How about your dad? Uh, he... he... he died when I was little. Oh. What do you think about this one? I think... I think we have a winner. You know, when I was little, we would decorate it with strands of cranberry and popcorn, and then on Christmas morning, we would hang them outside for the birds. I'll have to remember that one. I mean, I can grab it. Well, you can help me. Three, two, and... -One, two, three. -One! Jasper... I just wanted to apologize if I upset you. No. I should apologize to you. I came here because I thought my wife wanted me to. I thought this was her gift to me. I thought this was the way she wanted us to spend Christmas together before she... well. When I got that card... ...it kind of felt like she was still with me. Maybe it was a coincidence. I don't believe in those things. Never really did. I believe life sends us signs. It's up to us whether we ignore 'em or not. Can I see that card again? Of course. You're a winner! "Winner"? Of the sweepstakes. You know, "win a free trip to the inn"? Wait. I-I didn't enter a sweepstakes. Oh, these days, you don't even have to. They just pull from the mailing list. That's what happened to me. So you got one of these cards, too? Uh-huh! I sure did. Ms. Barton's reservation is... also blank. How odd. Did you ever hear back from Martha? Yeah. She couldn't remember. We'll keep trying, though. I mean, who invites three strangers to an inn for Christmas? Strange. This is so bizarre. There must be some connection here. It's really coming down out there. Welcome to the Snowfall Inn. Do you have a reservation? Sure do. The reservation's under Ted Roberts. Just give me a sec here. Ted? Karen? It's been a long time. I'm sorry. I just... I can't believe you're here. No, that makes two of us. I like the... Oh. I've been wearing my hair this way for a few years now. Suits you. Room 12. -Hmm? Oh. -Just upstairs. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, it was, um... really nice to see you. You too. Hmm. how do you? We dated in college. He had put a notice up on the community board, looking to carpool a ride home during the holidays, and as luck would have it, he lived just two towns over from me. On the ride home, there was an awful blizzard, and it forced us off the roads for a night. And you... you stayed here? Uh-huh. Wow. Were you together long? Two years. If you had asked me back then, I was sure he was the man I was going to marry. So what happened? Oh, he got a job that involved a lot of travel. We tried to make it work, but it got too hard. We just weren't meant to be. Well, you're both here now. Oh. We've lived whole other lives. No. I'm a different person. I'm sure he is, too. Whatever we had, it's in the past. Okay, and we're gonna see you on the sleigh ride on the 22nd. Okay. We'll see you later. Oh, Sarah. I just went through the last three months of reservations. What... What? No, it's just... I know how busy you are. You didn't have to do that. No, no. I wanted to help you. I mean, everyone. Thank you. Did you find anything? Yes. There is another guest we should talk to. When the card showed up, I thought it was a gift from my brother. He knew I had been looking for the perfect place to take Cass. And you didn't ask him? I did, but I thought he was being coy, like he didn't want to take the credit. Yeah. Did you bring the invitation with you? Well, if you think of anything that might help, will you please let me know? Of course. You haven't, uh, told him what you want for Christmas yet? I've been looking for a Christmas activity to do with my teen daughter, you know, something she'll really love. So far, all I've done is strike out. Well, what is she interested in? I thought I knew, but... my wife and I, we separated a few years ago. We split the time between us. It's been hard on her, and Lord knows it's been hard on me. I just... I just want to give her the perfect Christmas, you know? You could always ask her. Talk to her. Oh. Hi. Sorry. I-I was just looking for Ben. Oh, yeah. One of the guests needed a lift into town. I'm Bess, Ben's sister. Hi. I'm Sarah. Oh, so you're Sarah. Ben told me all about your mystery invitation. Uh, yeah. He's been trying to help me track it down. I've probably been taking too much of his time. Oh, no, I wouldn't worry about that. Nothing makes Ben happier than helping someone. Ah, I just wish he'd make himself a priority once in a while. My brother has spent weeks decorating this inn, turning it into something... ...magical for the guests staying here, but look at his office. Well, how can I help? Oh! Well, uh... this tree. I'm just doing the garland. Yep, sure. Thank you. Okay. Just... great. Yeah, anywhere is great. Does that look all right? That looks great. Can I ask you a question? Sure. It is... 8:42, and you're here playing chess with me. Why? Because... I am four moves away from checkmate. Okay. First of all... -Mm? -...in your dreams. And second of all, I'm serious. Well, um, I used to... I was engaged, uh, but she called it off. I'm sorry. No, no. No, don't be. In the end, she made the hard decision for both of us, and it was the right thing to do. I told my family that, uh, this inn was a smart investment, but I wasn't completely honest. I, um... I thought about the last time I was truly happy, and, um, it was here, and then when the inn came up for sale, I thought it was, like, a sign, you know? A chance to take a real risk and... and find something really meaningful. Anyway, if I fail at this, I guess I'm back to where I started. Are you in any of those old photos? Huh? Oh. You know, I never really looked. I don't think so. You are! Look, are you gonna make your move? Or are you afraid I'm gonna put you in checkmate? Oh, you're appealing to my competitive nature. That's pretty smart. -Did it work? -Nope. Checkmate. Checkmate? No, it's not check... What? No, no, no. Hold on. Do you even know what you're looking for? Well, you said you came here through high school, so I'm thinking "Ben minus a few years," maybe shaggier hair with the same charming smile. You think I have a charming smile? I will find this eventually. Ah. Look at you! You're so little! -Is that your sister? -Yes. I like the bow tie. I'll have you know I received many compliments on that bow tie. I believe the word my mother used was "dapper." Oh. Nice. Mm-hmm. I said I liked it. What's wrong? Do you know her? That's my mother. You okay? She was here. She never mentioned this place, but... that's her. Do you think she's why I'm here? I don't know. Yeah. Do you believe in fate? It's a comforting thought... to know there's purpose behind it all. Even the hard stuff. Yeah. Now, why don't you come inside... ...and I'll make you some tea? That's very nice, but... I think I'll just stay here and... think. Okay. See? Perfect fit. Okay. Good morning. Hey, Owen. Oh, Sarah! I did have it after all. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Hey. What are you doing here? Oh, just dropping off some last-minute Christmas cards. You? Um, well, picking up. One more. Nice. Uh... thank you. For what? For last night, for... for being there. How are you? I'm better. I just wasn't expecting to see her, you know, here of all places, and it just threw me for a minute. Well, the ink's a little smudged, but that's our postmark, all right. Hmm. So even though they weren't mailed from the inn... ...they were mailed in town. Yeah. Huh. Thanks. So, mailed from town. -Hmm. -Whoa! All right. Thank you. Let me... Let me help you. I can help you. Oh, no, no, no. I totally... I've got them. -No, let me... -It's all right. Yep, yep. Yep, here we go. Sorry about the Christmas tree. Ooh, sorry. Can you... -There's this one down. -And I did not help at all. - Oh! - Sorry. Let's see if I can get this. -Ah, yes. -Okay, here. I got it. Oh! Thank you. All right. Of course. Fantastic. What... What are these? Lights, for tonight's tree decorating. You're coming, right? Oh. How could I possibly say no? And how were you going to carry all this if I didn't come along? Well, luckily, I won't have to find out. I think that you're looking for "G." It's right here. Thank you. You take lessons? I've been teaching myself. Really? There are these videos you can watch and follow along. Would you play me something? I'm not that good. "C." You got it. ♪ Noel, Noel... ♪ Yeah. You did great. Keep practicing, okay? I will. Thank you! Excuse me? Hi. I don't think we met. Owen. Cassidy is my daughter. Jasper. She's a very talented young lady. I just want to say thank you. I don't think I've seen her smile since she's been here. Would you be interested in working with her, on her music? I've been trying to find us something to do, and I think she'd really love it. Do you play? Guitar, back in high school, but I haven't played in years, and I don't think I'd make a very good teacher. Then let her teach you. I have something that may help. Jasper, how about you give us a hand? Looks like you all are doing just quite fine without me. Please. Come on. All right. Okay. Okay, that's enough. Looking good, everyone. Sorry I'm late. I had to step out for some cranberries to go with the popcorn strings. That's... Thank you. You're welcome. Looks good. Okay, let me get it set. One second. You know, I think I'm finally getting the hang of this. Oh, okay. You're over halfway done? That's... I'm out of practice. Okay. I want to know which one of these is yours. Hmm? That one. This one? Mm-hmm. Your happy memory is a cat? It was one of my mother's cases that I worked on when I was back home. -Hmm. -Yeah. Mary Hargrave, this very, very sweet woman, was about to have her husband's pension cut off because of some ridiculous clerical error, and when we won, she wrote me this three-page letter, and she signed it from her and her cat. Yeah. It just felt like I actually made a difference, you know. I haven't felt like that in a long time. Hmm. What? Oh, nothing. It just, uh... you called Brooklyn your "home." Oh, well, I mean, it was. Just a slip of the tongue. Hmm. Yeah, that must be it. Do you know what we need? Hmm? Some Christmas music. Yes. That is exactly what we need. Bing or Nat King Cole? I know this is a long shot, but do you happen to have the Blue Note Trio's Christmas album? Blue Note Trio? Yeah. My parents used to listen to it every Christmas. They practically wore the vinyl out. Would I know any of their songs? Uh, I don't know. Maybe... maybe "Time for Me to Come Home"? Hmm. How's it go? I'm not singing it. Come on. ♪ The pies Are in the oven ♪ ♪ You can almost Taste the air ♪ That sounds a little familiar. Keep going. ♪ It warms my heart To feel her love ♪ ♪ And know How much she cares... ♪ ♪ It's funny how ♪ ♪ Going back ♪ ♪ Can get you back ♪ ♪ Where you belong ♪ You know that song? I do. The Blue Note Trio was my band. There were only about a hundred of those holiday albums pressed. And my parents had one. Wow. They weren't the only ones. Looks like we had one after all. I'm sorry. -No, I am. -Oh! Good morning. Seems like we have a mystery on our hands, huh? Yeah. Who do you think sent your invitation? I always leave my business cards in those raffle bowls, and two months ago, I won a toaster. Well, this is certainly a step up from that. Yeah! There are some nice memories attached to this place. Our first Christmas together. Well, and as I recall, we weren't together at the time. I was working up my nerve. Never thought a girl as pretty as you would give me the time of day. Oh. Well, I'll let you get back to your coffee. Ted? Yeah? Uh, there's a tree lighting, downtown, tonight. Would you like to go? We could... catch up? I'd love to. Great. Why don't I meet you in the lobby at 7:00? 7:00. Ben? Oh, hey. -Hey. -Morning. What are you doing? Plow's running behind this morning, so I just have to clear away the driveway for the guests. - Oh... - You have another shovel? Bess, you are not helping me shovel, okay? You're my guest. I wish you didn't feel like you have to do everything by yourself, Ben. It's okay to ask for help, you know. What, admit this was a mistake? Was it? Look, I know what this looks like, okay? It looks like you had your heart broken, so you bought an inn. Ben, you are chasing the past, trying to recapture a feeling. You should be looking towards the future. She's leaving after Christmas. You can't hide away up here forever, Ben. Hey. -Hey. -Hi. Looking for something? Yeah, I just wanted to see if maybe there were some more pictures of my mom. I just feel like she might be the key to figuring this all out. Any luck? No, but there has to be a connection. Look... look at the release date. 1984. The same year your mother was at the hotel. Exactly. Follow me. Not all the pictures are on the wall. Check it out. Huh. Oh, and that's Frenchie, one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, the owner. Big shoes to fill. I'd say you're doing a pretty good job. Yeah? Yeah. So I kind of went through some of these boxes, but I don't know. Tell me about your mom. Oh. My mom was brilliant. Yeah. She was so strong. And she loved Christmas. I mean, I know a lot of people love Christmas, but it was so special to my mom. She'd plan the whole week. Caroling and ornaments, tree trimming. We baked enough gingerbread for the entire block. I never missed it... ...until last year. They asked me to help out with a big client, and... on the partner track, and I just couldn't get away. You know, I thought... I thought, "It's okay to miss one year." If I had known... - Hey. - Sorry. Hey. Wait. Wait. That's her. That's... That's my mom and dad. They were both here. Oh, that's... that's Jasper's wife. Do you think that's Karen and Ted? They were... they were all here. All here. Who's that? I don't know. There's nothing written on the back. I know this seems an odd question, but... is that you? Yeah. Yeah, that's me. I must've been... four? Those are my grandparents. Wait. Where'd you get this picture? We were here? It would've been Christmas, 1984. I was on the road... with The Blue Note Trio, for the holidays. Had a big show in the city that I couldn't miss, and she was coming to meet me. These are your folks? Yeah. I met them. You did? The busses stopped running because of the snowstorm, and when the storm stopped, your parents drove six hours out of their way to bring my wife to me. Boy, she talked about that Christmas for years. She made quite an impression. Was my mother at your concert? That must be why they had the album. Your mom hardly left the dance floor. - No. - Yes. She had a great spirit. Yes, she did. And... the album? I gave it to 'em. It was a Christmas gift. Isn't this just remarkable? How... just how all of our lives have intersected? What was your wife's name? Sarah. Her name was Sarah. This was your mom? I had no idea. Do you recognize the man in the photo, with the glasses? He's the only one that we haven't accounted for. Patrick? No. Peter! Yes, that was it. Peter? Peter who? Oh, I don't think he ever said, but it was so long ago. I don't know how far that gets us without a last name. You really think he's the one that brought us all here? I don't know, but... it's as good a guess as any. Do you have a dress for the Christmas party? No. Come with me. I asked him to go to the tree lighting. -Oh, Ted? -Mm-hmm. -And? -He said yes. Are you nervous? A little. I don't know. It's... seeing him again, it's almost like we're right back where we left off. Oh, that is so nice. Mm-hmm. Oh, what do you think about this? Oh, I love it. I bet Ben will, too. No, we're not... this... this-this isn't for Ben. Oh. I'm sorry. I just assumed. You two have been pretty inseparable. Well, just because he's been helping me with the whole invitation mystery. Oh, I see. Well, that's too bad. He's a real sweetheart. And did you see him in that sweater? Karen! What? He looked good. It really brings out his green eyes. I'm going back to Seattle after the New Year. I mean, my life has been on hold the last few months, and I... This has been a really nice escape, but I have to get back to the real world. I can't put it off any longer. And his eyes are blue. Ah. Well, maybe you can join him at the lighting tonight. Where are we going? You'll see. So? What do you think? Ben helped me set it up. He said we could use the space to play. We? This is cool. Where'd you get that? Jasper lent it to me. I didn't know you played guitar. Well, I'm a little rusty, but... I think I can keep up. What do you say? Want to jam with your old man? "Jam"? Look, Cass, I had no idea you were interested in music, but if it's something you love, I'd like to be a part of it, too. What should we play? So... Oh. You first. Okay. Um... so you're a teacher? Third grade. My students can be a real handful, but I love it. Well, you always said you wanted to work with kids. You remembered. Of course. What about you? Uh, sales. That makes sense. Oh, yeah? Why do you say that? Well, You always did have a way with words. Bet you can sell snow to the North Pole. I did, last month. Made a fortune. Thank you. Oh, they're about to count down to the lights. Ooh. Thank you. What's wrong? Oh, gingerbread order for the party fell through. I've been trying these other bakeries, but they're booked solid. Oh. Bess loves those cookies. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. I just... I want this Christmas to be perfect for everyone. Well, what about you? Me? Yeah. When do you get to just enjoy Christmas? Oh, well, it's not about me. Maybe I can find a vendor online. You know, we should probably head back. No. You want to see the tree. Yeah, but this can't wait. I... You want me to have the perfect Christmas as your guest? Yeah. Come with me. -Come with me. -All right. ...Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... -Wow. -Oh, it's beautiful. It is. Thank you for coming with me. Nowhere else I'd rather be. And to think you almost missed it. Oh. Speakers will go over there, please. Thank you. -Hmm. -I was thinking. How did the inn record reservations in 1984? Um, paper ledgers. Okay, so if we could find the reservation from that night... ...we could find the name of the last guest. Exactly. Follow me. Let's go. Oh! Here it is. Catherine Thomas. That's my mom. Karen... Ted... Peter Sanderson. Peter Sanderson? Who's Peter Sanderson? He's... I don't know. Hold on. Let me look it up. Okay, Peter... Sanderson. He's local. Mm-hmm. Says he grew up in Bevington, and... still has family that lives in the area. Wait. June Sanderson? She owns a bakery downtown. What are we waiting for? What are we waiting for? What are we... Yeah, I can't. Ahem. Sorry. I just can't go with you. I... -Yeah, no, it's fine. -Too much to do. Of course. I understand. I'll... The decorations, and I still got to make gingerbread cookies. You... you're... you're actually baking them yourself? You find me when you get back. I want to hear everything. Okay? You'll be my first stop. Okay. Have fun. Thank you. All right! Did you get it? I got it all. You want to come see? Thanks, Jasper. You two sounded wonderful. I'm going to go show Mom. So, uh... Ben asked us to perform a song at the Christmas party, and, uh, we'd love for you to join us. You two sounded great. You don't need me. It would really mean a lot to her. I'm not ready to get on stage yet. My heart's not in it. Well, if you change your mind. Thank you! You coming? Yeah. Yeah, that's my uncle Peter. Do you have a number where I could reach him? You're staying at the inn, right? Yeah. Oh, he'll be at the Christmas party. Never misses it. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Just think. We could be a few hours away from finding out why we're all here. I'm not sure I really need to know. What do you mean? When I found out someone I didn't know sent me the invitation, sure, I had questions, but, oh! I've had such a wonderful time here. The "why" seems less important. It's almost like it's fate. Hmm. Oh! What's all this? You need cookies? We're making cookies. I have a great gingerbread recipe. We've got bakers. We've got frosters. You didn't have to do all this. I wanted to. We all did. All right. Help us out. ♪ Ding dong, merrily on high ♪ ♪ In Heaven the bells are ringing ♪ Let's crack some eggs. ♪ Ding dong!

It was a team effort. Really. It meant a lot. Well, you're... you're always doing so much for others, you should have someone looking out for you, too. It's been a long time since I had someone like that. You deserve it. Uh... Oh, we... we have to go. It's almost five and there's something I have to do first. Yeah, great. Um... Sarah? Yeah? I'll see you at the party. I just miss her. I know you do. And being here, all of these traditions, everyone with all of these memories of her, just... It's reminding me of all the things I won't get. She won't see me get married. She won't meet her grandchildren. She was my best friend. But we have memories. Happy memories, memories that are always with us, that we can call on when we need them. I just wanted to spend one last Christmas with her. Aren't you? Hello? Is this Sarah Thomas? Uh, it is. Oh, I'm so sorry to be calling so late, and so close to Christmas, but I just got a letter saying I'm going to be evicted. Mary Hargrave gave me your number. She said you were gonna take over your mother's practice, and you might be able to help. Yes. Does the letter you received say "notice to quit" or "execution"? Uh, notice to quit. Oh, okay. Good. That's... That's very good. That means you have time. So you will help me? I'm sorry, but I'm actually not staying in New York. But I-I will find someone to represent you, I don't want you to worry. I'll be in touch after the holidays with a name, okay? Oh, thank you. And Merry Christmas, Ms. Thomas.

You look beautiful, by the way. Oh, thank you. I wanted to say thank you. For what? For everything. This has been a... a really hard year... losing my mom, and spending Christmas without family. You have people here that care about you. And you have me. I do? Yes. You do. Truthfully, I've been thinking a lot about us. And, um... Ben... Sarah? Ben, it's him. Who? It's him! Um... Excuse me. -Mr. Sanderson? -Yes? I... uh, Peter Sanderson? Yes, that's me. And you are? Sarah Thomas. I wanted to talk to you about the cards. Cards? The invitations. Oh, the ones with the poinsettia? -Yeah. -Yes. I'm sorry. I had to decline the invitation. My wife and I were traveling. Didn't you invite us all here to the inn? No. Oh... uh, if you'll excuse us. It was nice to meet you. -You too. -Yes. I was so sure. I know. I mean, he was the only other person there that night. If... if he didn't send the invitations, who did? Sarah... I don't know what or who brought you here... but I'm so grateful. This has been the best Christmas of my life. That's because of you. But... I'm leaving. Right. Seattle. It feels right. Does it? Ben, I don't... Everything in my life is upside-down right now, and my job is the one thing that I have left that I recognize, and I... I... I don't think I can lose that. It just feels like too much. I should probably get back to... to the guests. Ben... I'll be right back. Sarah? Is everything all right? Yeah. No. I don't know. I feel like I thought I knew what my life was supposed to look like, and I just... I'm not sure. I know just what you mean. Oh, my goodness. Is that... I thought I saw her earlier. Well, that's Frenchie. She owned the inn the night that we all met. She took those photos that you found. You look nice. Sarah. Sarah? It was you. We were so busy looking at the guests, we forgot there was someone else there that night. The owner. You sent the invitations. I suppose I owe you some answers. It was Christmas Eve when a storm blew in, and with it came my first guests in weeks... a young pair of co-eds on their way home... ...an older couple with their precocious grandson... ...a beautiful young singer on her way to see her love... ...and a soldier and his wife, with a little one on the way. I had no sooner checked them all in than the storm blew the electricity. The lights went out. The heat dipped. They could have all left. I offered to refund them. But then something miraculous happened. They brought in fresh firewood for the fireplace, they lit candles, there was music and laughter. That night changed my life. I kept the inn... and six months later, I met my husband... ...when he came to stay at the inn. 35 happy years together. Two precious daughters. I don't know what my life would have looked like if that Christmas had gone differently. Fate has a way of putting certain people in your path right when you need them. But why invite us all back? It was my gift. To us? To Ben. I hoped maybe I could recreate a little of that magic for you. Oh, Frenchie... Thank you. Come here. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. That night, did you make the memory ornaments? It was Catherine's idea, and it became a beloved tradition at the inn. I'm so sorry for your loss, but I hope you can see that the people we lose never really leave us. You remind me so much of her. You've only just met me. Well, I heard all the stories! Your mother loved to talk about you. You stayed in touch? Did she tell you about last Christmas? She understood why you couldn't make it. Above all, she just wanted you to be happy. I just don't really know what that looks like. I mean, I thought I knew, but I... you know, I have so many questions, and I feel like I'm at this crossroads and I... She would be my first phone call, you know? No one can give you that answer, Sarah. Only you. Have I told you how lovely you look tonight? Twice. Twice? Well... Well, you do. Thank you. Isn't it funny how it feels like we've all come full circle? It's been real nice spending the last few days with you, Karen. For me, too. I, uh... ...have a confession to make. You do? Yeah. I've been thinking a lot about you lately. You have? Mm-hmm. Just dwelling on some what-ifs, and when I saw you at the check-in desk that day... ...it felt a little like a Christmas miracle, like we got a second chance... if that's something you'd be interested in. What are you doing for New Year's? Whoa! All right! Whoo! The Jingle Belles! Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for coming out tonight and celebrating this Christmas with us.
