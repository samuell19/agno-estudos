[Soft music plays] They say, right before you die, your entire life flashes before you. [Sighs] Well, right before you kill... [Scoffs] there ain't no flashes. All you see is darkness. [R&B music plays] Yeah, wasn't nothing wrong with that man's shoe. You just don't appreciate a good workingman. Uh, if don't work the heel out the back of them, hell no, I don't. Okay.

Well, I ain't never had to worry about that. I love 'em, and when they act up, as they always do, I leave their triflin' behind. Girl, all men ain't trifling. Maybe it's just you two. Uh.. When the last time you had somebody? Ooh. Including your sister? [Laughs] Child, don't be encouraging this fool. I'm 'bout to go get my knife and cut him everywhere but under his feet. Ooh.

I mean, I wasn't used to a lot of attention. And I definitely wasn't used to guys looking at me like they couldn't wait to touch me. [Laughs] But it made me feel sexy. It made me feel pretty. And, eventually, I traded in my minimum-wage checks for cash money. I changed "Falicia" to "Summer," and I started getting paid. ...through the night Anything that you want, I'll... And then after awhile, [Scoffs] I met Robert. [Scoffs] That was it. Just come to me I'll...

[Both laugh] [Birds singing] Robert was so smart and mature. [Scoffs] He was my first real relationship. And it was like he didn't see me as a dancer. He just saw me for me. [Soft music plays] I want to tell you something. [Smooches] Anything. So, you know how we've been seeing each other for six months and... like, we're really feeling each other... and I love you, right? Right. Well, I haven't been feeling too well and... I'm pregnant. [Sighs softly] I told Robert about the baby, and he seemed to be okay. We were still hanging out, were still kickin' it, but then he just started acted funny. He stopped coming to the club. He always had something else to do, [Scoffs] talkin' 'bout he was already "in a situation." [Scoffs] I couldn't believe it. And then, on top of that, one day, he left me stranded, and that was it. I ain't seen or heard from him. He was gone. [Footsteps approach] Ma. I need to talk to you. What you got goin' on? Well, I'm seeing this guy... Mm-hmm. ...uh, I was, anyway. [Voice breaking] We broke up. Oh, Lord, Falicia. Ma, this is serious. [Sighs] Okay, I'm listening. I thought he really liked me. Well, they all make you think that. Ohh, baby. [Sighs] You okay?

And then, before I could look like the "baby mama stripper," [Chuckles] I went on work leave, got myself together so I could take care of me and my baby. But I knew I was gonna miss them 'cause it's like we always had the best times together. [Baby crying] Oh. Oy! [Crying continues] Am I the only adult in this house? Can somebody get her?! Damn! Trying to get ready for work! [Crying continues] Ma. Ma. Hmm. I'm leaving, and she needs a bottle. Okay, well, I'm busy, and you need to call her daddy. Now, why would you say something like that?

You still got your knife on you? Let me ask you something. You still got your knife -- Let me ask you something. What? What you need to ask me? Tam done told me you was around the corner. That's what I'm saying. You always believe Tam... If a man finds a woman who's desperate enough, a woman who just wants something close to love and don't care about nothing else, he'll find out he can treat her any kind of way. Where you goin'?! As long as he still acts like he wants her, even a little bit, she ain't going nowhere. 'Cause it ain't even about the love. She just don't want to be alone. It's crazy how time makes stuff crystal-clear. [Soft music plays] [Door opens] [Laughs] This is it. Oh, oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait. One second, one second. This and this... this. All right, make yourself at home. Okay. This is it, yeah. Got a nice little spot. 'Preciate that. Right. What's this? Come here. I ain't gonna bite. Okay. [Roars] [Both laugh] Why would you do that? I'm playin'. You play too much. I'm playin'. Talk to me. About what? About you. [Glass rattles] But you already know me. That's bull. I want to know Falicia, not Summer -- you know, stuff she likes, stuff she don't like, stuff that means something. And why you want to know all that, hmm? Because getting to know you is important to me. Okay. We could start simple. What's your favorite color? I don't have one. And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. [Chuckles] Okay. All right, so, if you could fly anywhere, where would you want to go? Okay. I don't know. Somewhere hot. Somewhere by the water. So, if I was trying to be your man, what type of stuff you like your man to do? Nice stuff. Take me out to eat, come see me dance. I mean, the jewelry you bought me, that was nice. Why you asking me all this, anyway? 'Cause I want to make you mine. That a'ight with you? Unh-unh. Nah, I need to hear you say it. Say, "I want you to pamper me and do whatever it takes to make me happy." I want you to pamper me and do whatever it takes to make me happy. Look, I don't know what them other brothers been doin', but Big Dino's here now. Why they call you Big Dino? Why you think? [Smooth jazz piano plays] Ight. [Laughs] That was fun. High five. You want to do it again? Yeah? Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go! Whee! [Gasps] There's Mommy. My baby have fun today? She did. Yeah? We worked up an appetite. Yeah? How was your thing? All right. That was for some classes, right? Yeah. Mm. Just weighing out my options. Well, whatever you want to do, it's gonna cost money. That's what I'm here for. I'm gonna put together a plan where we can stack that money, then start over somewhere else. I talked to my boy about getting you a job at Blue Flame. Blue Flame? I thought you said I was too classy to dance at the club? Nah, I said you was too classy to be working where you was at. Oh. Don't get it twisted. You got skills. We can't let that go to waste. Baby, you one of the baddest chicks in the game. Now, once we get this paper stacked... then we can talk about options. All right? [Soft music plays] Yeah, it's a'ight. I get it. Just hungry. That's all. Well, let me take my girls to get something to eat, then. Let me take her. Come on, baby. You ready? You ready to go get something to eat? Daddy. [Singsong voice ] Yeah, Daddy's gonna take you to get something to eat. [Chuckles] [Normal voice] Come on. [Paper rustling] Here. I'll give it right back. You know I'm good for it, right? I guess. You guess? I ain't never asked you for nothin'. I take care of you, remember? Yes. Yeah. It's cool. It's cool. You know what? Nah, it's okay. Nah. No. I want you to have it. Nah. Take it. No, no, I was trippin'. Take the money. No, I'm tr-- Trust me, I was just -- Trust me, my head was somewhere else. I want you to have it. I want you to have it. I trust you. I trust you. That's my baby. Come here. You got my back. Yeah. We're like a family... me, you, Shawnee. Let's get out of here. Now, you making good money, but if you could make a little more, we could get out of here sooner. I asked for an extra night at the club, but [Sighs] they said they got too many girls. Too many? Then why would you beg me to get "Pumpkin" a job there? 'Cause that's my girl. I don't know them other chicks at the club. Okay. Fine. But you gonna have to figure out a way to make more money while you there. You one of the baddest hos in there. Look, you know what I mean. You should be coming home with $800 a night -- at least $700. Look, "Boo-boo," I don't want you to have to work at that club for too much longer. I got my money coming in. Now, if you get your paper straight, I figure we could get out of here in a few weeks. That's what you want, right? You know I do. Then you know what you got to do. Now, I figure if we get $6,000, we can move somewhere nice, near water. Now, look. Now, I got to run out. I'll be back to take you to work. All right. [Door opens, closes] [Hip-hop music plays] Yeah She got that boom-boom [Indistinct] She got that "try to make a swag" life She got the hands on them knees She got that try to make it jump She got that loud, she got that crunk She got that givin' them what they want She out there, run, do her thing like she wanna be freaky At the beats, they bangin', and her hips get to swingin' And her...start to shakin'... get to breakin' They said, "Dollar for the takin'" Ain't no frontin' or no fakin' If you ain't got nothin' for her, she ain't got no conversation If you ask her what she drinkin', she'll be dancin' like she... She was out there [Indistinct] like an earth quakin' And the deejay played a song, I don't know what he was thinkin' Then she took her shoes off, and she had her eyes closed Made a big circle just to watch the mama, though And get that bread up in their hands just so her ass can hit the flo' And then she work it... Hey, girl. What's up, girl? I love it here. I'm making so much more money. God, Dino hooked us up. Yeah. What, you don't like it here? It's cool. Girl, when Dino came and swooped you up like Superman, I didn't know where you was gonna end up. Should've knew that fool had something up his sleeve, though. You actin' like you know my man. I do. They all the same. Just tell him I said thank you for hooking a sista up. [Laughs] And take this fan with you for your sweaty ass. Thanks. [Scoffs] She got that try to make it jump What's up, sexy? Hey. It's a little crowded in here. How much for a private dance? $50. And that don't include tips. She got a wild streak in her like she can't be tamed I got $100 more where this came from. Till I drink it from the back Hell, I have it for the front Luckily, I'm 26... You straight? Yeah, I'm cool. Come on. ...and they did 'cause [Indistinct] You just takin' it in 'cause this is what she said I'll make the rent, I'll work the trap I'll pay the rent Say dip, and they did because you so [Indistinct] You just takin' it in 'cause this is what she said I'll make the rent, I'll work the trap I'll pay the rent You can run this...

Well, let me go get one. I'll pay the rent You can run this... [Music continues in background] [Siren wailing in distance] [Hip-hop music plays] Hi, Daddy! What up, what up? Hey, baby. How was your night? It was all right. How much we make? Like $400. That's it? Parking lot full. There was one guy in the champagne room. He wanted to give me $150. And he ain't had no rubbers, so I went to go get some but... How you gonna let a payin' dude go? Huh? Hmm? You know what? No. Come here. I'm sorry. I'll make sure you have rubbers next time. All right? It's my fault. [Soft music plays] It's all right. It's that wallet you was looking at the other day. Yeah. [Sniffles] I-It went with the purse I wanted. What purse? Talking 'bout this purse? [Chuckles] Thank you. No. [Sniffles] Baby, thank you. Thank you for putting up with me. I love you. Baby, I'm sorry. [Sighs] I'll be right back. "I...love you." Ain't no man ever tell me that before. And he'll do anything for me and my baby. And I ain't never had that. Yeah. He's got a temper. So what? I just got to learn what makes him mad and not do it. He probably never had nobody have his back, show him what love is. So that's what I'm gon' do. Falicia and Dino. [Nina Simone's "I Put a Spell on You" plays] I put a spell on you 'Cause you're mine [Scatting] You better stop the things you do I ain't lyin' No, I ain't lyin' You know I can't stand it, your runnin' around You know better, Daddy I can't stand it, because you put me down Yeah, yeah I put a spell on you Because you're mine You're mine [Saxophone solo] Yeah, yeah Oh, yeah [Scatting] I love you, I love you I love you I love you anyho-o-w And I don't care if you don't want me I'm yours right now Ah, you hear me, I put a spell on you Because [Scatting] You're mi-i-i-i-ne Look at this fool over here, eatin' salad. [Laughs] You watchin' your figure, nigger? I'm tryin' to stay in shape. [Both chuckle] How's your food? It's all right. [Chuckles softly] Somebody at the club say you be trickin' girls. [Chuckles] And... And... I told 'em you don't. [Both chuckle] I got a few girls. A few girls? Yeah. I manage them. I mean, I don't make them do nothing they don't want to do. All I do is manage their money. In fact, I was thinking about putting you in charge of the girls. Me? Hell yeah. You'd make a good manager. I mean, you like control. Plus, you got a good heart. They'll like you. Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] So that means that we would be working together. Like Bonnie and Clyde. [Chuckles softly] That's hot. Bonnie and Clyde. Yeah. I like that. So, look, somethin' went down. I had to use some of the money we saved. You spent the money? Mama... don't start that whining. All you got to do is take care of the girls and still work the club. We could get about a G a night. Next month, we'll be straight. [Sighs] We'll be all good. 'Sup, girl? Hey, Q. What's up? Yo, what's up, man. I'm Q. My bad. Fool, I don't know you. I'm sitting here, having a conversation with my girl. I don't appreciate you interrupting us. What you say? You heard what he said. Bounce. Y'all trippin'. Falicia. I'll see you around. Q's my friend. How you know him? Well...he used to be at the club. I ain't never heard you mention no Q. He ain't about to walk in here while I'm talking to you and disrespect me. Don't ever let that happen again. Let's just get back to our business. Well... how I'm 'posed to be doing all this running around with Shawnee? I don't want to keep leaving her with my mama. I'll get you a girl. I got the perfect one, Venus. Your ex? She's a babysitter. You're a manager. Everybody got roles to play, girl. Why you trippin'? I ain't trippin'. I'm cool. As long as we get this money, it's all good. Bonnie and Clyde, baby. [Chuckles] [Chuckles softly] Let's get out of here. You done with your salad? Yeah. Together we can make... The fact that he put me over all of his girls, that mean he trust me with his money, and y'all know how important money is. So that means that he must really trust me. So I just got to show him that I could hold my own, make a little money, and the quicker I can do that, the quicker I can stop doing this. I mean, the champagne room ain't that bad, especially if the guy is kind of cute. And if I keep just thinking about this money, get a little drunk, before I know it, it's over. And, you know, I just got to do what I got to do to make him happy. 'Cause when he's happy, I'm happy. ...all the money 'Cause I like to dream about getting paid Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Together we can make all... I know you wanted more money, but these girls ain't making as much as you think they are. They playin' you like you stupid. Oh, you -- you're stupid now?

[Sighs] I know Dino gonna be proud of me when I get back. I just got to give Pumpkin her cut. That should leave me with like $500. $500 in two hours? [Scoffs] That's not bad. Yeah.

Now sit down. Sit down! Baby, you know I wasn't gonna burn you. I was just trying to free you of your fear. Now, we ain't got time. We got to get this money. Look, I wasn't gonna tell you, but I got fools out in the streets looking for me. We got to get out of town as soon as possible, or me and you are in danger. What did you do? I didn't do nothing! They set me up. We got to get this money. If we could just get $7,000 -- $7,000, we could move. We could start over. You could go to night school. $7,000? I thought we already had that. You know what... I'm gonna do you a favor. I'm gonna pretend like you didn't just question me, okay? Babe, you got to do your part. Can't you see I'm doing this for us, baby? Bonnie and Clyde, right?

I don't have time to play around today. [Screams] I seen a lot of stuff in my life before, but this was the first time that I ever seen a dead body. I mean, one of the strippers got her throat slashed outside the club one night, but by the time the police let us out, she was already gone. And I thought that was bad. But seeing here there, with no life... That was different. Real different. I told the ho, "Stop using." But what I'm supposed to do? I got to get this money. [Car door closes] Baby, are you okay? I'm fine. Where's Shawnee? She's with Venus. She's fine. Listen, I'm getting tired of this. We need to go and it needs to be this weekend. We could have been gone, but you messed up that run in Miami. Baby, I told you I was sorry. I mean, I'm trying -- Listen! Listen! I got something in the trunk. I need you to take it to this address.

'Cause you look a little hungry and a little skinny. Not right now, Ma. Please. I'm glad you're here. You know, I, I know what you think about me, Falicia. What are you talking about? I was young when I had you. I didn't really know what I was doing. That's why I sent you to live with Mama. Caught myself leaving, trying to figure it out. It ain't never really happened. Eventually, you just end up forgetting what you was even searching for in the first place. I was trying to survive. What you telling me this for? Because you need it. I used to fall for every man that showed me some attention. A little, and I was hooked. But what did that get me? Some money and some toys for y'all? What really is that? That's something. Some people don't do nothing for they kids, Ma. At least you did something. I used to think that, too. For what? For making you just like me. Ain't nothing wrong with you. Ain't nothing wrong with you, Mama. It's okay. [Crying] I'm so sorry. It's okay. You're just fine. You gonna be all right. You know what I'm gonna do? What? I'm gonna make you some dinner. It's been a while since we ate together, and I'm gonna make spaghetti -- your favorite. No. No, I can't. I got to go. Maybe tomorrow? Okay. Yeah. I mean, that's cool. All right. Oh, my God!

Sweet dime piece right there. Serious. So you just gonna walk by and not speak? I'm sorry. Do I know you? You can get to know me. [Scoffs] You have a cigarette? Nope. A blunt. My type of guy. So, what's up? You live around here or something? No. Why, you got something in mind? [Laughs] Yo, I got to get out of here. I'm going with you. You know if you get in my car, you know what's up, right? Oh, I know what's up. Hey, hold me down, fam. For real. I got you. Let's go.

[Giggles] Your eyes. Like baby eyes. [Chuckles] All wide-eyed and bright, huh? [Chuckles] I'm far from a baby. Oh, I know. Only a grown-ass woman could do what you just did, baby girl. [Chuckles] [Imitates laughter] It was good, huh? Get your punk ass up. Yo, Dino... Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just stand there like a little bitch. Oh, you scared? I came to collect. Where my money?

Shh. Where is it? The freezer. In the freezer? It was nice doing business with you. Ooh! Mm. Thank you. Baby. Take care of him. Come on, man. Yo, yo, Dino. It ain't like that, man. Look, look, look. It's different now. Or maybe it's the same, and I just didn't want to see it. Before you kill somebody, it ain't black. Just like your target, your life flashes before you, too, and you remember every painful moment that brought you to this point, and you think -- "I'm not a killer." And you believe it. For real. You believe you're the survivor. But at the same time, you know the truth. You just choose to hide it. [Gunshots] [Gavel bangs] In the case of The State against Ms. Falicia Blakely, the jury finds the defendant guilty of three counts of murder in the first degree. Do you understand the verdict that has been read before you? Yes, sir. Sentencing will be set two weeks from today. I love you. And I'm sorry. I don't know if life without parole was better than the death penalty they wanted. And after my test, we learned that I was HIV-positive. So they decided to let me live the rest of my days behind bars. [Scoffs] Man, these streets are so real. And when you're in that moment, to hit a lick, it ain't nothin'. You're surviving, and you don't think about the life you take until it's too late. Ma, I guess you was right. The fast life does catch up to you sooner or later. I don't know if Dino loved me. But I know I loved him. And this may sound crazy, but ain't nobody ever look at me the way he did. And that was real to me, and nobody could tell me different. Not even God himself.
