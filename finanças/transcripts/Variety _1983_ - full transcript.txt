(water burbling) (splashing) You got some lipstick I could borrow? Sure thing. (humming) - "Sin City"? - Yeah, nice, huh? - Wonderful. - Love that lipstick. (humming) Thanks. I wear it 'cause my mom does, I guess, I don't know. Really? I don't do anything my mother does. Otherwise, I'd be a fucking librarian. At least you got a job, man. Yeah, but the same bar for three years. I mean, I'm not selling my photographs. At this rate, I'm gonna be a 50-year-old bar maid. - Thought you liked it there. - I love the place, but how long can you listen to the same drunks tell the same stories day after day? You want a story, I'll give you a story. - You know what I did today? - What? I went to the fur district to look for a job. I saw this ad in the paper that said, "A publicity person needed," well, I'm not trained in publicity, but, you know, what the hell, I figured I'd go check it out. So I go in, and this guy says... We talked for a while, then he says, "Come in the back room and, uh, let me take a look at your tits." - Oh God, you're kidding. - No, I'm not. - Jesus Christ. - So I said to him, "Forget it, I don't want the fucking job, I'll leave." And he says, - "They're too small anyway." - What a schmuck! They're not too small anyway. Thank you, Nan. - I don't know. - Doesn't even pay to leave your house anymore and look for work. There are no jobs out there anywhere! Ridiculous. Well, what about teaching, you taught before. You're qualified, be a teacher. Yeah, I'd have to go back to Michigan to do that. Thanks anyway. What about that guy in the publishing business? He could get you a job. I mean, he must have copy editing or proof reading, - or something for you. - No, I called him up, he said there's nothing. So, you write articles, you could sell one of yours. I write articles, but nobody reads 'em. - Oh, come on. - It's true, Nan. I mean, first of all, I can't take the rejection right now, and second of all, you can't make very much money doing that stuff. I don't know, I check the paper out every day. Oh, come on, you can't get jobs through the papers, those are written for the relatives of the people who put out want ads. You gotta hit the streets, honey. Go out there and look, I mean, you're skinny, you're pretty. You could sell clothes, go to 5th Avenue. - Oh, 5th Avenue? - Yeah. You know people wait in line for those jobs? Truly amazing, people will do anything for work. Including me. I don't know, man. If I don't get a job soon, I... I don't know what I'm gonna do. - Really? - I really don't. It's... it's uh... It's getting bad. Well, I do know of a job, Christie, but I don't think you would want it, I really don't think you're the type. - Sure. - I don't think - it's for you, honey. - Look, I'm interested, what is it? Can I call you Christie? - Sure. - Christie, that sounds like a nice name, my name is Jose. - Jose. - Give me a ticket. Jose, okay... yo, Pancho, take it easy, man. Yo, you take care, okay? Uh, but how much are the tickets? - Two dollar, two dollar. - Two dollars. You have a nice time, okay, I'll be back though. - Two dollars. - Yeah, two dollars, two dollars. (cars whirring) ? (engine whirring) Come see all the strip shows you've ever wanted to see. They're all here, all here, live and in person today on the big screen, so... How you doing, buddy? - Doing all right. - All right, man. Have a good time, man, keep up with the screen, all right? All right, come here the most tempting, delicious, luscious, most favorable young lady you ever wanted to meet is on here in your dreams on the screen there... Hey, right here, buddy, this is the address, man. This the right place, this is not the unemployment office, dude, come on. ? - Have a good night. - Two dollars, sir. The most precious and beautiful, and... Hey, how you doing, Pancho? All right, glad to see everybody here tonight. - Thank you. - Two dollars. - All right, come on in. - Out of ten. We got enough room for everybody. We got enough room for your uncle. We got enough room for your grandfather. For your brother-in-law... How you doing, man? Good to see you. ? Christie, you got a cigarette? Tell you what, if you give me a break, I'll give you the pack. You want a break for a pack? I'll give you a break for a pack, okay? - All right, hey. - I'm gonna take one. Just one, yeah, 'cause I want it. Just one, and the lighter. You know, when I sit in here, I really get chain smoking. I don't like being interrupted, and you have a nice time. Okay, how the hell do you work this thing here? Oh yes. (deep breathing) ? Oh, oh yes, ooh. ? (moaning) ? (grunting) ? You're a whore, aren't you? ? (moaning) Oh! (moaning) ? Oh, mm. (heavy breathing) (machine whirring) Oh. Let me see your eyes. (indistinct remarks) (moaning) ? (moaning) ? (muffled voices) ? (indistinct remarks) You know what made me really happy? When you ran (unintelligible). - Why? - It was so good to watch. ? (coins clinking) (machine whirring) (thudding) Shit. (machine humming) Ooh. Wow, are you okay? (indistinct muttering) (panting) Oh, ooh. - Cup? - What? I noticed you spilled your Coke, I thought you might like another. (moaning and grunting) Thank you. No trouble. (panting) (indistinct chatter) So. Guess what kind of a story I gotta get from the edges. Well, so how you... How do you go about that? Well, first I heard about it, was this group that was within the union was trying to get themselves elected into leadership, but they weren't part of the establishment, so not only could they not get in but they all get fired. Oh, shit. And I heard there were a lot of guys down there complaining and I thought there was something going on, so I went down, I talked to a couple of 'em, they told me that the union was pure mafia. - Oh. - That's some pretty heavy stuff. I don't understand though, how do they work that? A lot of these guys who are wholesaling fish down there are being charged incredible rip-offs. And so, I wanted to get the story while it was happening, wanted to go down there and talk to him. I figured that they'd wanna talk, I figured, you know, they'd really wanna talk. Then, a couple of them did talk, and they said, "We're being charged rent for these cardboard signs with the seafood workers' union seal on it. Just to carry these little signs around, we have to pay an annual rate of three grand a year." And there are 40 or 50 of these things, - so we're talking about... - A lot of dough. Annual rate of nearly a hundred grand a year, so, it's obvious that the union is into some kind of a racket. None of these guys would name names, and none of them would go public, or for the record, so that's all I could get. (indistinct chatter) Can I have a cup of coffee when you get a chance? Got a job yesterday. Great, what is it? Just a job. What is it? It's on 48th Street, actually I'm not gonna make - very much money. - What is it? I sell tickets in a movie theater. Well, that's good, you can get me in for free. Where... what do you... What kinda movies do they show? Porn movies. So, wait, it's po... porno? Yeah, um, I sit in a glass booth between the lobby and the street. Most of the guys that, that come in are sort of lonely, down-and-out types. Some business guys that come in there too, I guess they can't get it up anymore. Sometimes I think maybe they come there because they... They think that I'm some sort of attraction, but mostly I think that they're just sort of embarrassed that I'm there. You work there alone? No, there's a ticket-taker named Jose, he's a real nice guy, he says he keeps an eye out for me. Then, at night, I just add up my receipts and split. What else? What else? Not much, I mean, um, in the morning, the guys stand outside and they, they wait for the doors to open. So they shuffle their feet, and stand there and wait. They don't say much. And then, when the doors do open, the smell of Lysol comes out, it really stinks. Then, the guys go in, and they, they rush to get the best seats. Most of the seats there are either broken or, um, really uncomfortable. And then, inside on the screen, a woman reaches up and unties the neck strap of her halter. Half-turning, she steps out of her panties. She licks her lips, and rubs her nipple until it's stiff. "Fuck me," she says. You go in there? Yeah, I do. (indistinct chatter) Jesus, Christine, I gotta go, I gotta be uptown by two. - Maybe I'll see you tonight, or? - I don't think so. But I'll call ya. Will you pay my check for me? - Sure. - Here. Thanks, bye. Bye... you want your... (pool balls clacking) ? (indistinct remarks) ? - Well. - Aw. ? My whole wallet, sweetheart. ? All right! All right, fifty-fifty! ? - For you. - Thank you. - It's on the house. - Oh, thanks, Nan. Fifty bucks, it was an easy fifty bucks. - Where's he from? - Connecticut. His name Bob? - Mhm. - Yeah, I know him. - The same one? - Yeah. You off today? Nah, I'm working on the late shift. Ugh. How's it going? You look a little out of it. Trouble with Mark? No, it's not that, it's just... - My job. - What, Variety? It's nothing, you're not doing anything, you're just selling tickets. Don't let your job get to you, come on. No, I know, but... Something weird happened yesterday. What? Tell me, come on. What? It probably wasn't anything, it was probably just me. Things are either weird or normal, and if they're normal, they tend to get boring. She's got a job down the street selling tickets at Variety, you know the place. Oh, dirty tickets and dirty movies. I know that place. Some guy try to pick you up or something? No, it wasn't... It wasn't anything. Don't let those creeps get to you. They come into all these places, I have to throw them out all the time. (indistinct chatter) ? The other night I was on the stage, ten minutes, and someone called me down, so I went down and I sat with him. He was with a friend, they told me they were from Florida, and it was his friend's birthday. I said, "Good, we'll celebrate your friend's birthday, and have a good time." They bought me a small cocktail, and he says, "How much would you charge to go to a hotel?" "Look, it's your friend's birthday, forget about it, let's just have drinks, and have a good time." No, he wanted to know how much I would charge to go to a hotel. I just said, "Okay look, forget it." I finished my drink, I went back up onto the stage to dance, and this girl came and she sat with them. The manager called me over and said, "What happened?" I said, "They kept asking me how much I wanted to go to a hotel, and I kept telling them I wasn't going to no hotel." He said, "Well, she just got a bottle, go sit with them." So, I got dressed and I went back down and sat with them, and the girl pulled me over and says, "Come with me to the bathroom." So, I went to the bathroom with her, and she goes, "Just tell 'em you're gonna go, you don't have to go, just say you're gonna go." I said, "No, I don't wanna do that, because maybe they'll wait outside for me." So, we got back to the table, and she says, "Okay, fine, we're going." What happened? They were cops. So, I got busted, she got busted. I went to jail for 22 hours. Prints, shots. Twenty-two hours I was in jail, and I kept telling them, "You're making a mistake, I don't do this thing, I'm a good girl, I'm a good girl, you're making a mistake," and they, "Sure, all you girls say the same." So, I went to jail for 22 hours. Did you get fined? Yeah, they charged me $250 fine, but the agency paid for that. They paid the lawyer and the fee, and then, I went back to court three times, and they dismissed the charges, and they gave me a letter of apology, and told me to pick up my prints whenever I wanted. But that still doesn't mean anything, Albany has them, you know. If you want a good job, your prints are gonna come up. - That sucks. - You're telling me that sucks, I wanna kill that woman. Good thing I don't see her in the street anymore. So, what do you make when you work in a place like that? Oh, you can make between a hundred to two hundred dollars a night. Easy. What do you have to do? Well, you have to dance topless. Hustle champagne, get the men to buy you champagne. They only can buy you champagne. Doesn't matter if it's a glass, a bottle, whatever. As long as it's champagne, and maybe, if they... if they buy you a big bottle, they can feel a little thigh and what not, you know, it's okay. Do the same guys come back, or is it different guys all the time, or? What do you mean, like a following? Yeah, I have my own fan club. Yeah, they... I have like... Once a week, I have someone come to see me. ? How... how many nights a week do you work? Well, it depends how much money you want. You can work one night, or seven nights a week. If you're interested, I could take you up to the agency, and they can start you working right away. And if you don't wanna dance topless, you could make... You can do dirty movies. You'd make more money making dirty movies. - Yeah, you'll get paid... - You don't wanna make those dirty movies, they're so sleazy. Maybe she needs money in a hurry. Yeah, but that's not a way to do it. And then, they've got you under their control. Listen, I'll tell you something, this... this thing happened the other night in the bar where I work. You know that Haitian waitress? - That really beautiful... - The bar on 49th Street? - That really thin, thin girl. - Right, yeah. All of a sudden, in the middle of the night, she just had enough of all these guys. She got up on the stage, and she ripped her wig off. And underneath she was completely bald. Shaven, the guys freaked out. And she put out her claws like this and she started hissing at them all. And they got up, left the bar, they couldn't take her. So, we were putting the music on the jukebox that we liked, and we danced, and she went crazy all night. She just said, "Fuck you." ? - Show started yet? - Which one ya wanna see? Sex Roulette, or The Devil Inside Her? Sex Roulette. - There ya go. - Thank you. ? Oh. ? Come on, come on, come on. ? Have a nice time, stay off the screen. ? - Jose. - Huh, que? - Come on over. - Que, mi amor? Diga. Can you give me a break for a few minutes? Do you want a break, you really want a break? - I really do want a break. - Sure, I give you a break. You a nice girl... I give my mother a break, I give you a break, I give all nice girls a break. - Okay, you know why? - Why? 'Cause I'm Jose, that's why. Thank you, Jose. Oh. Ooh! She gets finer by the day. Ooh, all right. (cars whirring) (moaning) ? - Do you wanna marry me? - Oh, Jack, mm. ? (panting) (moaning) ? (car brakes squeaking) (engines humming) How about a ticket? Here you are, sir. Sir? My name's Louie. Maybe I should bring you a coffee this time. That's all right, Louie. You do remember me, don't you? Yeah, you bought me a Coke the other night. You should let me buy you a real drink sometime. No, I couldn't do that. (traffic whirring) And if you did? (engines whirring) (sighing) Hi, Hon, it's Mom. I've been trying to reach you, I can't ever get you in. Now, be sure to call me back, because I won't be home this weekend, I'm going to Jean's. Did you send off that letter to Arthur? I know he'd really love to hear from you. Love you, bye. Bye. (dial tone droning) Christine, it's Mark. I'm not sure I can make it tomorrow, I'll try to call you later.

I'd just come over there, give you a little tongue job around the world job, (unintelligible). You shave around the crack. I like all that stuff, the little hair. You got the shaved beaver, right, you're Sally, right? Hmm. You're the one with the shaved one, right? You shaved your little cunt. You got the pine tree growing up out of your ass. Yeah, you got the shaved beaver, right? You can't just let me lick it just for five minutes. Let me come over there, I won't talk or anything.

I like all that stuff, the little hair. (engines whirring) ? - I just saw you over there. - I was hoping you'd get here soon, I'm in a rush, but I wanted to talk to you. Talk to me, about what? I have seats for Saturday's ball game, I thought you might like to join me. Ball game? I haven't seen a ball game since I was a kid. Working? Yeah, I work till five. The car will be here at six. The car will be here at six. ? So, um, who are you? What do you do? Like everyone else, I work for a living. Me too... I mean, I just sell tickets, I don't... You don't usually go out with strangers, particularly if they're men, right? I don't. Do you have a boyfriend? Yeah, sort of. He doesn't mind you going out on your own? No. Not really. You're not nervous, now, are you? Yeah, I am, a bit. Well, let me assure you, you don't have to worry about me. Are you asking me to trust you? Oh, well, to tell you the truth, it was... I don't know, curiosity more than anything else that prompted me to invite you out tonight. I think you're very, very beautiful. Thank you. I noticed you looking at me. No, I was just wondering what someone like you was doing selling tickets at, you know. What do you mean? It's just a job. I enjoy it, I like it there. What's so funny? Oh, I was just thinking. About what? Just thinking about that place where you work. - Variety? - Yeah. - What about it? - Well, have you watched any of the films yourself? - No. - You haven't? - No. - Come on, I don't believe it. I hear them, I can hear them from the lobby. What do you do on your breaks? Smoke cigarettes in the lobby, hang out, take a walk. Well, surely, you must be fascinated by it. A little bit about... Maybe you don't like the movies. Do you go to the movies? Do I go to other movies, you mean? - Yeah. - Yeah, sometimes. Now, come on, you tell me the truth. You look in there, you look at those movies, right? Actually I haven't yet. - Hm. - Do you have any favorite movies? Well, if I told you what my favorite was, it wouldn't mean much to you if you didn't watch the movies. No, but I could look for it, I guess. - You could look for it? - You know, I could watch for it, - and... - Well maybe, maybe one time, next time I come by, take a longer break. Come in there. There's some interesting people in there. You have what you call first-hand experience? - At what? - Hm? - At what? - Well, at what you do. - Which is... - Hey, you're relaxing now. You're not nearly so uptight. No, I feel... I feel better now. - Okay, yeah. - And more comfortable. Looking forward to the game? Yeah, I am. ? Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light? ? What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?? ? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight? ? O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?? ♪ And the rocket's red glare ♪ ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪ ? Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there? ? Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave? ? O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?? (audience cheering) (indistinct chatter) (clapping and cheering) (crowd shouting) (indistinct remarks) Uh, listen, something's come up, I've got to leave you. - Um, I'm sorry, I... - Where are you going? Uh, well, listen, I'm very sorry I have to leave you, but I'll send a car around to pick you up later. Hot dog! (crowd cheering) (horn sounding) - Charge! - Charge! (horn sounding) - Charge! - Charge! ? (tires squealing) There's something extra special, extra delicious about those New York Yankees franks. The only... ? (engine revving) ? (footsteps nearing) (water sloshing) (tone droning) (horn blowing) (tones beeping) (indistinct chatter) (tones beeping) (indistinct remarks) (indistinct chatter) (traffic whirring) Yeah, let's go. Yeah, right here, man, this the place. This the place, you got the right address. All the pretty girls you wanna see are all in here, man. What you wanna see, The Unseen? Wait, wait, wait. ? Here we go, ladies and gentlemen. - Four dollars. - Hey, you didn't like the film? Stay home then... All right, here we are, ladies and gentlemen... sir, sir! Can you see what number came out for me, thank you. How you doing there? Right, all right. (indistinct conversations) You have a good time, okay? (indistinct remarks) ? (traffic whirring) (engines whirring) (brakes screeching) (thudding) (indistinct chatter) (clattering) (indistinct remarks) (indistinct conversations) Oh, sorry. (indistinct remarks) (horn honking) (speaking in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) ? So, I went to this guy and I went to Daily News. He's been on the police beat for years and he's got a list of all these characters, all the stories they've been involved in... - I hope you like this... - What is it? Put this up here for both of us. And I checked him out and it turns out that half these guys, half the guys in the union are involved in an organization, a family. They all got these nice little houses out in Queens, out in the Bronx, they all got these three-piece suits, they walk around the fish market with these gold watches on and they got guns in their pockets. And, uh, they all got rap sheets. Everything from loan sharking, narcotics, pornography, fixing fights... They're like classic shake-down operations. They pretend they're part of a union, they shake everybody down from the guy who sells the fish to the restaurant owners. There's no, like, big companies involved. There's all like, small-time handlers. You mean, you've got a list of these guys? - Mhm, I've got enough. - Wonder if he's on it. Computer, computer print-out list from this guy. Wonder if he's on it. Who? - This guy I know. - What's his name? - I don't know. - Where'd you meet him? Uh, Variety. He comes by Variety sometimes. What makes you think he's on it? I don't know, I mean... Probably isn't, it's just a thought, you know. Well, these guys are pretty smooth. It's gonna be hard for me to nail 'em. They say if I manage to sell to a big enough magazine I'm gonna be able to protect anybody who gives me information, but otherwise, I will have to feed it to the cops and we know that's gonna be a whole other story. Other story. Other, other story. Story. Stories. Small, small, stories, smooth skin, smooth... Smooth black slip against her skin. She parades in front of him. He's sitting in an armchair. She... he strokes himself, he's getting larger and larger. Her red snake skin heels click, click across the floor as she paces. The high heels push her ass up in the air. He licks his lips. She kneels down in front of him and he, he reaches, grabbing at her hair, her hair. She shakes him away, and pushes him back into the armchair. Uh, then... she slowly... lifts up her slip, showing herself to him. Goosebumps run up and down her thighs. She slides the slip slowly up, slowly the slippery fabric. Then, sex smell fills the room. She kneels down on all fours, turning to him, opening herself to him, the slip clinging to her hanging breasts. She waits, waits, for him. What are you doing? Are you okay? Why are you telling me this? I'm telling you about my life. Yeah? Relax your mind so your entire body may relax. Relax your forehead. Relax your eyebrows. Relax your eyes. Relax your nostrils. And exhale and inhale. Slowly and smoothly. Relax your cheeks. Relax your jaw and the corners of your mouth. Relax your chin. Relax your neck. Relax your shoulders. Relax your upper arms. Relax your lower arms. Relax your hands. Relax your fingers. Relax your fingertips. And breathe as if your breath is flowing all the way down into your fingertips. As if all your tensions are dripping off of the fingers. Relax your chest. Relax your cardiac center. And exhale and inhale. Slowly and smoothly, while relaxing the cardiac center... relax your stomach, relax your navel. Relax your abdomen. Relax your thighs. Relax your calves. Relax your feet. Relax your toes. (metal creaking) (sighing) (crowd chattering) (beeping) (alarms whirring) (indistinct chatter) ? (knocking) ? ? (machine tones beeping) (indistinct remarks) ? This guy was hitchhiking and he got a ride from a woman in a pickup truck. It was late at night, he needed a place to stay. So she offered him her place. She showed him to his room and offered him a drink. They drank and talked and decided to turn in. He couldn't sleep, so he put on his pants and he walked down the hall to the living room. He stopped short of being seen, but he could see. The woman was naked and spread on the coffee table with just her legs dangling over. Her whole body was excitingly white, as if it had never seen the sun. Her nipples were bright pink, fire-like, almost neon. Her lips were open. Her long, auburn hair licking the floor, arms stretched, fingers tickling the air. Her oiled body was round, with no points, no edges. Slithering between her breasts was a large snake, curving up around one and down between the other. The snake's tongue licking toward the cunt, so open, so red in the lamp light. Hot and confused, the man walked back to his room and with great difficulty, managed to fall asleep. The next morning, over strawberries, the woman asked him to stay another night. Again, he couldn't sleep. He walked down the hall, up the beaded partition and looked in. He managed to notice that the table was different. This time, solid black oak with four sturdy legs. She was spread naked-ass in the middle, her painted toes just touching the woolly rug. A tiger entered, circling low, slowly round, steadily faster and faster, flicking his tail back and forth until she moaned... he stopped. He placed one paw on either side of her cunt, seeking entry. She attempted to guide him in. They swiveled on the edge of unbearable and heated agony, then a portion of the penis entered. The tiger jerked, the remainder entered. She moaned louder, her hands clutching the fur around his neck. The man was beside himself. He could watch no more, and returned to his bed where he lay through the sleepless and heated night. The next day, while he lay in the long grass dreaming, she came to him, lay next to him, and kissed him deeply. He felt her moving up against him so snake-like, so delicious. She growled while pushing his hand down her panties, "Son of a bitch, what are you doing to me?" He touched her, her cunt was wet, inviting. "You son of a bitch," she purred. "Not now, tonight, tonight," and pulled away. The night finally came and this time, he went further into the lamp-lit room, closer to what he wanted. She was naked and appeared to be asleep. He took off his clothes and he sat beside her, his hands tracing the lines of her ass. Breathing deeply, he took it out and slid down her, sucking her pink-nippled breasts down the swelling belly, his hands rounding and gripping the smooth of her buttocks. He pushed his pulsing lips over her skin, licking, flicking, circling with his tongue through her beautiful red pussy. In and out, she moaned and lifted her legs to lock around his throat, over and over, while he placed his cock inside, shoving for entry, over and over, oh, it was wet and tight and warm inside, over and over, deeper, and bigger. She kissed him, wildly thrusting in and out, deeper, wider, harder, pushing in and out, everything exploding and climaxing over and over, over and over, and over.

You know, I mean, I go out to eat with a guy, and if he pays for himself I consider myself lucky. Yeah, me too. There was this one gambler who used to really lavish all this attention on me, told me I look just like Gwen Verdon. He'd take me to after-hours every night after work and I'd just hang out while he played cards with the boys. He was a compulsive gambler and he talked about his horses just like they were women. He'd take me home all the time but he wouldn't fuck me. - What? - I'd wake him up and ask him, "Why won't you fuck me, what's the matter?" And he said, "I have to get up early to bet on the daily double." I got really obsessed with him and one time - I even followed him. - You followed him? Yeah, to Burger King in Queen's Plaza, - can you believe it? - Oh. But his twin brother told me at the end that he must have cared for me, 'cause I was the only woman - he never borrowed money from. - That's a good sign, that's a good sign. Now, I don't care if people don't have money. It's... you know, I don't care at all. You know, if a man shows the slightest interest in me, I jump at it and he gets... He gets more appealing to me all the time. I don't know, I go after him. - You'd follow him? - No, me? I wouldn't follow him, I'd follow him in my head, maybe. But I have to act indifferent. - I have to be really cold. - Well, that's no way - to deal with it. - How would you deal with it? Take what I can get. ? - How you doin'? - I don't know you. Yeah, I saw you in the show, I thought you looked real nice. Well, you made a mistake, it was somebody else. I thought you might like to go out for a drink or something. No, I don't want to have a drink. - Hey, why not? - Stop it. - Why, what's wrong with me? - Leave me alone. Nothing's wrong with you, you're just acting - like a jerk, that's all. - What do you mean, why don't - you like me? - Get the hell out of my life! ? Jesus, Jesus. ? (vocalizing) ? ?

It's urgent that he reach me at 496-8801, I'll be here for the next 15 minutes. (phone ringing) Hello? This is Christine. Hi, Louie. It's been a long time, hasn't it? Oh, I think you remember me. But let me see if I can't refresh your memory. It was quite a while ago. You bought me wine. You picked me up in a car. You took me to a ball game. That's right. Actually, I know quite a bit about you. I've seen you in a number of places. Store on Broadway. You know which store. Then after the ball game, I followed you to your restaurant. That's right. You went to Asbury Park. You met a business acquaintance at the Flamingo Motel. Of course you don't believe me. No, I'm not a cop. No, I don't know who that is. I'm not connected with anybody, this is just between you and me. I don't exactly know that right now, but I'll know when I see you. Money? I don't think so. Look, it's 6:15. In an hour, I'll be on the corner of Fulton and South Streets. You meet me there. (tones beeping) ?
