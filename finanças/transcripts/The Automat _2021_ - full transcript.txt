The number of restaurants it had, the number of people it served every day, the number of people it employed. It was a true phenomenon of its time. Well, how about the Automat? I heard a lot about that place. It was what Philadelphia was all about. When you said Philadelphia, you said Horn and Hardart. They were interchangeable. When you thought of the Automat, you thought of New York, and vice versa. It was a tourist destination on par with the Statue of Liberty. [horn honking] The little cubicles that the food would come out of... Allow me. I mean, I've never seen anything like it.

His two brothers were in the restaurant business, and he wanted a restaurant, too, so he goes on a cross-country trip all over the country to just sort of figure out the kind of restaurant he wanted. One day, he's in Boston and he goes to Thompson's Spa for lunch, and he sees the way the place is working, and he sees these people being served coffee. The whole choreography that just enchanted him, and the... the bulb clicked in his head, and he said, "This is exactly the kind of place I want to open." So he put an ad in the paper saying that he needed someone to co-partner with him, and enter Frank Hardart. My great-grandfather, Frank Hardart, he spent his youth in New Orleans working in the kitchens of restaurants. At the time, New Orleans was the only city in the country that was making French pressed or French drip coffee. He understood how special it was, and he knew that once he got the rest of the country to taste it, they would appreciate it too. So Frank came up to Philadelphia on this mission to get working in a restaurant and bring that coffee from New Orleans to the city of brotherly love, but he faced continual rejection until, as folklore has it, he saw an ad in a newspaper. - And the rest is history. - And the rest is history. Yeah, exactly. They opened their first place at 39 South 13th Street, but they didn't have Automats yet. Frank was in the back doing the cooking, and Joe was out front tending to the customers. For Joe Horn, courtesy was the word. He was the one driving home how to create an environment that was all about treating people well. And Frank was focused on making sure that everyone got to taste that wonderful New Orleans coffee, and it worked. [bell dinging] After a little while, they opened another restaurant, and then another restaurant. Around the time Horn and Hardart were opening their first restaurants in Philadelphia, the automatic restaurant was showing up in various parts of Northern Europe. These restaurants were basically dumbwaiter systems where you would order something in a dining room upstairs, and that order would be conveyed to people downstairs who'd prepare the food and then send it up via a small dumbwaiter. Frank Hardart discovered this Automat in Germany and arranged to import the entire Automat along with some engineers to install it in what was then the first automatic restaurant in America. [swanky music] ♪ ♪ So wait, you're an Automat historian. How did you pick that for your PhD dissertation? That's not a... [laughs] So that... I chose the Automat as a... as a topic. I was studying to become a historian of technology. I needed a topic for my dissertation, and I was in Amsterdam at the time when I stumbled across the Automatiek. That triggered this vague memory because my parents took me to one of... this restaurant that I thought had had the same sort of machine, and when I returned, I started researching, and only to discover that that wasn't just any restaurant. That was Horn and Hardart, and I had my chance to, like any other kid, choose from the dozens and dozens of boxes. This was the last Automat, the fourth generation of that machine. The first generation was the one that Hardart himself brought back from Germany. What is, in effect, the first Horn and Hardart cafeteria was not really efficient. Fortunately, Horn and Hardart had a chief engineer named John Fritsche. Fritsche developed a lot of patents related to the Automat technology. He introduced the fundamental innovation of the drum. He found ways to make them hold both hot and cold food. He changed the way the coin slots worked. Fritsche came up with the vending machine wall and all the little doors. America at this time had a real fascination with machine-age technology, and anything that acted like that had a big attraction. And very quickly, Horn and Hardart's new Automat was a success in Philadelphia. [bright sweeping music] And the decision to expand to New York was an obvious one. It was the next really large industrial urban center. ♪ ♪ And that was the beginning of one of the most successful restaurant chains in America ever. ♪ ♪ My big brother, Irving, used to come at the beginning when I was very little, and he would dole out whatever it was, five nickels to each of us.

The question is, the Automat hasn't been an active cultural force in decades, but it's something that still resonates with New Yorkers, and why is that? Horn and Hardart... oh, okay. Let me start at the beginning. Horn and Hardart is a cultural icon in New York. In the immigration wave from 1880 to 1920, the immigrants who came to New York were looking for something American, and Horn and Hardart served as an Americanization process. If you could go there, you could feel like you were part of the larger American stream. Horn and Hardart, like the subways linked us and were universally accessible, didn't matter whether you were rich or poor. When you had to travel, you took a subway. When you had to eat, you went to the Horn and Hardart. We know you don't need English because nobody has to speak. In a land of foreigners, that became a place of identification, and you feel almost patriotic. [soft music] ♪ ♪ At that same time, a new class of clientele started to come in the cities, drawn in by the new office work that was being created. They started flooding into cafeterias and into the Automats. Women were just coming into the workforce. They were stenographers. They were sales clerks. They were secretaries. Between the 1880s and 1920 or so, the number of stenographers in New York City jumped from 5,000 to 300,000. This enormous growth in the number of women in the workforce meant that there was enormous growth in the number of women who needed to eat lunch out of their homes. - Well, I've had my lunch. - Good. But I'll go with you. Not so good. Social custom was changing slowly. Women started being able to go out to eat on their own, and women of the 1920s went to Horn and Hardart. It was a place a woman would feel comfortable and safe, and they had good quality food. Yeah, and they didn't have to worry about tipping. That was a great thing about the Automat. You never had to tip. It's a very important marriage between that... the time it came into being and the sensibilities of women in the workforce.

And those dolphin spouts, nowhere was there anything like that. When did the dolphin heads come about? Yeah, well, they were inspired by Italian fountains with mythological sea creatures. Joe Horn, on a trip to Italy, had happened to spot these statutes and says, "Oh, that's gonna be my coffee spout." So that's where they came from, but I love the fact that these two men, Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart, built this beautiful, beautiful space. All of that beauty so that someone could walk in there with a handful of nickels and get themselves a cup of coffee or some food.

On the phone, when you spoke of Joe Horn, you said you met him when you were young. I certainly met him 50 or 60 times. To be clear, though, he was called Mr. Horn. Nobody within range of him referred to him as Joe Horn. He'd have clobbered somebody who did. Mr. Horn was a very formal man, very genial, very pleasant, but very definitely commanding person. I always found him very nice. He certainly established the company's tradition of making certain that Horn and Hardart was looking out for its employees. For Joe Horn, right from the start, loyalty was a trademark. Joseph Horn actually wanted his employees to bring their troubles to him. If he could help them in any way, he would. The Horns and the Hardarts, they went to the wakes. They went to the weddings. They went to the funerals. They had holiday parties. [upbeat piano music] You became a member of a family when you were employed at Horn and Hardart.

I began to look into the history as deeply as I could. ♪ ♪ And my responsibility, I think, about the Automat, has more to do with the... the concept of the Automat than it does the machines themselves. It started with a set of principles. Mr. Horn and Mr. Hardart said, "You can do something the right way. "You don't have to compromise. "It's harder that way, it's more work, but you can do it, and you ought to do it." That's what they said, and then they proved it by doing it. [projector whirring] Around the turn of the century, Horn and Hardart were already operating a small chain of stores, vending mostly baked goods. [pleasant music] The problem they had was that each store was making its own baked goods and they didn't have the consistency and the high level of quality they wanted from one store to the other. This is what drove them to start on the commissary model, the centralization of the food preparation for the entire system. Oh, the Horn and Hardart bakery, you remember the bakery, Dad? 11th... to 12th Avenue. That's where all the food came from. Not all, let's be clear on that. There was cooking in the restaurant, but a great deal of the food was prepared, and all of the baked goods, of course, in a central commissary. With their commissary, they could make 2,400 pies an hour. And what Horn and Hardart realized was if you did something on a large enough scale, you could give people prices they could afford. But, to be clear, it was all about quality. They had the sample table every day in which the management tasted the food that was coming out of the bakery to make sure that the public was getting what the public was supposed to be getting. The trucks supplying the restaurants numbered in the hundreds in each city and drove something like 2,000 miles a day. So everything was fresh and seasonal. - It was real. - Seasonal was important, because that's also the way they kept the cost down, because they could buy seasonal in bulk. ♪ ♪ And that's why, if you didn't have the commissaries, you wouldn't have a Horn and Hardart Automat. ♪ ♪ The 1930s brought the Great Depression, which was damaging to almost every business. Horn and Hardart was a notable exception. [indistinct chatter] [soft music] The Automat was a welcoming, warm place in the worst of times. It appealed to the poor and downtrodden because, for a nickel, you could get a lot. We were providing good, cheap, quality food when people didn't have a whole lot of money in their pockets. Because of its economies of scale, because of its ability to tap into these values of thrift and abundance, Horn and Hardart's restaurants became a beacon and light in what was otherwise a really dark decade.

When I ask people about the Automat, they light up, and I'm just wondering, why do you think people love the Automat so much and remember it so fondly? It was a good place to eat. The food was delicious, the prices were right, but more than that, I think it was the fact that there were all kinds of people, from poor people to matrons in furs. You're sitting at a table with a bunch of people, one of whom might be a businessman. Another person might be a worker. Another person might be an artist. It was an unspoken rule that if there was no empty table, you could sit next to anybody who was already eating. It was true. You'd see... at a table, you'd see a bum with an empty cup of coffee, someone on your left, he'd get some hot water, and he'd put some mustard or ketchup in it, and he'd have, like, a condiment soup.

Yes, this is the great USA with people of all different colors and religions and manner of dress, and yet we are all together. [horn honking] [indistinct chatter] The one we would usually go to is the Automat that was on 42nd Street. I never even thought about the fact that, "I'm a Black kid." "Should I go into Horn and Hardart? Is it okay to go to the Automat?" All the Automats had that beautiful diversity that didn't exist in most of the rest of the country, of economic standing, of color, of ethnicity, of language.

You gotta get a still of this. This photo was taken when I was about seven years old living in the South Bronx, immigrant family, not making a great deal of money. So you have to understand, we almost never went to a restaurant. I don't ever remember going to a restaurant anywhere in the South Bronx. We always ate at home or with a relative. So going to an Automat was not just the experience of seeing this mechanized food delivery system. It was going to a restaurant, and as a kid, it was such a thrill to walk into this place. Sparkling. It shone. I mean, it literally blasted you with the marble and the tables that were marble. And there is this wall where little compartments had the beautiful chrome-rimmed knobs. And you knew there was somebody behind those little compartments. You never saw them, but you knew they had to be there. And better than that, the food was good. The Automat was where I learned to like creamed spinach. Macaroni and cheese. Automat food became so recognizable, particularly the signature dishes. There's baked beans and baked beans, and then there's Horn and Hardart's baked beans. I really got excited about a Salisbury steak. Oh, don't tell my mother this. I liked the ham and cheese sandwich with mustard. I think there was an olive stuck in it. It was great. I don't know what Carl ate at the Automat. Did you ask him what he had? It always consisted of the same thing. A ham and cheese sandwich, a cup of very good coffee. - Carl was much more frugal... cheap. Cheaper than I am. It was cheap. Very cheap. Eggs, bacon. Chicken salad. I loved the creamed spinach and succotash and the sweet things. One part mashed potatoes, one part baked beans, and one part Salisbury steak, and you've gone to heaven without dying. For my family, it wasn't just the Automat. It was Horn and Hardart, because there was also a retail store in my neighborhood, and on the weekends, on Saturday, I would usually get a couple of dollars, and I was told, "Go get a Horn and Hardart apple pie." And that was the height of the week's experience. [light music] Can you describe the presence of the retail stores here? The concept of the retail stores is very simple. The idea was we would sell our food so that it could be taken home, and it was a very successful move. The slogan was "Less Work for Mother." Less Work for Mother retail shops. Everything was fresh.

Yes, they had good food, but it was an important place for me and other people. I can say there were parts of Philadelphia that were segregated like skating rinks and bowling alleys. But Horn and Hardart's was a nice place where African Americans could go and feel dignified. Even though Horn and Hardart in the '50s and early '60s was as big as it had ever been, they were no longer making money the way they used to. In the late '50s, we were beginning to see competition from a company called Chock Full o'Nuts. People could come into Chock Full o'Nuts, get some coffee, which is what they were chiefly named for. Get out, spend very little money. It represented the first serious competition we'd had in a long while. I'd call that the first cloud in the sky. [men grumbling] Every time someone buys Horn and Hardart coffee, it hurts us a little. Horn and Hardart uses such ridiculously expensive coffee beans. We lose money on it. We could make money by buying less expensive coffee beans, but then our coffee would be less good. Horn and Hardart coffee: it's so good, we lose money on it. Horn and Hardart was losing money on every cup of coffee that they sold. Post-war inflation made everything more expensive, and the nickel was no longer worth what it once was. They waited as long as they could afford to until finally, Horn and Hardart raised the price of coffee, but the vending machine couldn't take pennies. So Horn and Hardart had to go to 10¢. They doubled the price. The results were disastrous. Number of cups of coffee sold immediately dropped from 70 million a year to 45 million. [solemn music] For some reason, there was this emotional attachment. Yeah, they were known for that 5¢ cup of coffee. The nickel subway ride was gone. The nickel phone call was gone, but when the nickel cup of coffee changed, it created a very emotional divide between the Automat that they knew what was coming to them. The beginning of the end. I mean, it was called the house that nickels built. ♪ ♪ My father fought that battle to keep it at 5¢, and when the decision was finally made, he physically collapsed and required medical assistance for several days while he was flat on his back. The decision drained him so much, but it had to be faced. [sweeping music] ♪ ♪ A quiet revolution has been taking place for nearly a decade. More than a million persons each year have pulled up stakes in the cities... In 1957, President Eisenhower put the interstate highway system in. The result was to encourage businesses to locate outside of the center cities. The center city was no longer going to be what it had been. That was a major cloud in the sky, and of course, it became a torrent in the sky. We shall build hundreds of thousands of homes during the post-war return to peacetime activities. Everyone was racing toward the suburbs. Women, for the most part, were raising families now, so they weren't working in the city. And men who were working in the city were not hanging around for dinner here. They were going home to their home-cooked meals. The romance, the adventure of choosing from foods gathered from the four corners of America. Also, tastes in food were changing. Frozen foods are the nearest thing to fresh foods available. They're convenient, easily prepared, and palatable. ♪ ♪ The people eating out were younger. They didn't care about saving money. They were willing to spend more for a service experience. Thrift started to become something that the consumers were actually turned away by. We knew that the demographic patterns were changing. These were worries. [indistinct chatter] March 28th, 1960, my father unexpectedly died. My father was a man who cared about people very, very strongly. [soft music] From the time of Mr. Horn and Mr. Hardart and my father, that's what Horn and Hardart was about. ♪ ♪ Employees and customers cared immensely about the company because they knew the company cared immensely about them. I think you've sensed that in the interviews you've had. Be clear that wasn't just a question of sitting down at a business school and saying, "Well, this is a good business practice." It was done because it was right. ♪ ♪ Edwin Daly took the company from 1941, when Horn died, into 1960, when he himself died. But Daly made a mistake that Horn had not made. He didn't prepare the company for a successor at all. In the breaking of the chain of people with a real commitment to the Horn and Hardart's original vision was a big part of what caused the problems that followed. ♪ ♪ I grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and as a young boy, I had always heard about New York City and Manhattan. I must've been about 10 years old when my Aunt Shirley took me into Manhattan for the first time in my life. She took me to Radio City Music Hall. It was amazing. We got out of Radio City, and she said, "I'm gonna take you to a very special place." Walked in. I remember putting money in the window, and the next thing I knew, the window opened, and I received an apple pie. And at that age of ten or so, I was mystified. How did this happen? And I remember asking my aunt, and she said, "There's a magician on the other side," and I believed that, and I have never stopped threading everything we've done at Starbucks with that initial experience. When we had 11 stores and a hundred people in 1987 and dreaming about what we would do, I always had the Automat in my mind's eye. How do you create that level of theater, excitement, surprise, and delight? The Automat was something unique and special. And really, when I think about my own career, despite what we've been able to dream about and accomplish at Starbucks, at the heart of it, I'm a storyteller trying to create a sense of discovery and romance. The Automat for me was a seminal moment in my childhood, and I became a merchant the day that I was in that Automat. ♪ ♪ [quirky music] ♪ When you least expect it, you're elected ♪ These are people who are gonna buy a roll. [laughter] Now, you can imagine it's pretty frustrating. [laughter] This fellow with a roll... [inaudible] [laughter] He's gonna try again, you know. He's very, very patient. Now he tries to return the two plates. In the '60s, there was a group that we organized. We met on the second floor of Horn and Hardart's at 15th and Market, where there were ideas about what could happen if we work hard enough. And we strategized about how we would be able to get into politics. It was the birth of the Black political movement in Philadelphia which led to my being able to run for mayor of Philadelphia. In the 1950s and '60s, I ate so much Horn and Hardart's meatloaf. By 1970, I really went off meat. [laughs] [solemn music] I was in Vietnam in the '60s. When I went in the army, it was still in the process of ending segregation. But I came in from Kelly Street and Horn and Hardart and the Automat. So I knew what diversity was all about. So integration wasn't anything new to me. I lived in integration. I was gonna help transform the army and make it understand diversity. ♪ ♪ In the '60s, my family had moved out of the city to the suburbs to escape crime. I had been the victim of crime. Horn and Hardarts were beginning to decline. As people kept moving to the suburbs, the breakfast and dinners and the weekend business that Horn and Hardart had always enjoyed disappeared. They were no longer serving meals seven days a week; they were serving them five, having a huge impact on the amount of sales each restaurant was able to do. We needed to reduce commitment in center cities. I'm now addressing Philadelphia. Let's face facts. In 1966, Horn and Hardart of Philadelphia closed their central city commissary and opened a new one in the suburbs that had access to superhighway routes and would give them a broader reach. But for some reason, instead of shrinking, they built themselves for enormous volumes of food, and that cost sunk them into debt from which they never recovered. - It was a blunder. It was overbuilt. It was badly located. It was just wrong. Horn and Hardart system, the commissary model, had been a brilliant system. It worked fantastically well, as long as everybody went and ate there, but when they started to suffer a drop in volume, things couldn't be scaled back. ♪ ♪ My father became president of Horn and Hardart at a very difficult time. I remember my mom saying it was sort of like taking over the helm of the Titanic. I don't think those last several years were pleasant for him in any way. There was a major recession in the country, but especially in New York City, and Horn and Hardart was a ship that was taking on water. ♪ ♪ The neighborhood declined very badly around Union Square. It was full of homeless and bums, but we'd go down to meet my grandfather at the Automat. Grandpa liked the Automat. He was a poor man. He was a garment worker. He would sit there and talk about how much he hated the Vietnam War in Yiddish to his friends who would meet him there. [soft music] ♪ ♪ One of their hallmarks was that you could go and spend a lot of time there, have a cup of coffee, meet interesting people, but the problem was people were coming and squatting. So you started to get homeless people and vagrants in the Horn and Hardarts, and so they went from being these beautiful, clean, art deco cathedrals to dirty and smelly and not a pleasant place to be. ♪ ♪ I was the busboy at Horn and Hardart 15 Park Row. My first time really seeing homeless people was when I was working down in that Wall Street area. The Horn and Hardart was the place where you could go and nobody would bother you. Where you could stay warm and get out of the cold. So they would just sit there all day. And I would at first try to get 'em out, but there was a policy to just leave people alone. In fact, sometimes I would sneak some leftover food over there... I would do that. This is me. I had the fro back then. And this was my grandmother, Sarah Perez. We worked at the same Horn and Hardart. She was a nickel thrower. You know, Horn and Hardart really cared for people, and that was something that just stuck with me. In fact, I recently retired after 26 years of social services in New York, besides all the other things I've done in my life. But that's what I'm most proud of. So I loved Horn and Hardart, and I loved it since I was a child because they had Christmas parties for the employees' children. ♪ ♪ My grandmother took my brother and me. We couldn't wait to go because they would have all kinds of entertainment and things for the kids. Got to see Santa, sit on his lap, and get these great toys. We loved Horn and Hardart, even in the '60s when it was kind of rough. In fact, my grandmother, she got an award called "I'm not fancy, but I'm good" award, which was an advertising slogan back then. How did the campaign get its name? It was the age of the fancy coffee shop. And so they were fancy and not very good, and Horn and Hardart, the food was wonderful, but the experience that people had in there was not always the best. There's a story about a Southern girl who came to New York. She said, "I went into a Horn and Hardart, "and I tried the baked beans, and mmm, they were fine, "and the... the candied sweet potatoes, "they were just like down home. "And then I had some of that lemon meringue pie, "and... and then the man sitting across the way from me, he... he flopped it out right in my pie." [snorts] Hey, Barn, disturbance in the Automat over on Tenth. - What kind of disturbance? - Some guy's raising hell. The Automat on Tenth? Yeah, he took his clothes off. He's running around naked. Charming. Well, that was the story of Horn and Hardart. You know, you'd go in there, the food would be great, and then you'd have someone do something like that. So I came up with this campaign for a product that had its flaws. These days, it's not enough to have a restaurant with good food and low prices. You have to have atmosphere too. Trouble is, this junk costs money, and to pay for it, you have to raise the prices or cut the quality of the food. But if you don't have quality chandeliers or canned music, wallpaper, you can put the money you save into better quality food. We think that's more important. You can't eat atmosphere. I was born in the Bronx. I grew up in Horn and Hardart's, and it was always a great treat for me to go into those places. So this campaign, it had an extra level of meaning for me. You know, we tried to resurrect it. We did what we could. [solemn music] This campaign was the closest thing to self-expression that I could ever have in advertising, I think, because it meant so much to me. ♪ ♪ It was absolutely the closest to my heart because... ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's New York. ♪ ♪ It was a sad day when I would go and look for Horn andHardart's and saw a sign... "We're closing." The closing of the Automat located at 818 Chestnut Street marks the passing of the old and the advent of the new. $271,000. Hold on! America's first Automat today was put on the auctioneer's block. The building and most of the equipment, that is. $271,000. Hold on! Once, twice, third and last time. Hold on! Right there. - There it goes! [soft music] For my father, it was the family company, and it had his family name on it, and it had been around for a very long time. So to be in a position to do that must've been really difficult for him. ♪ ♪ Horn and I used to have lunch once in a while, and I can still remember him calling me and saying, "John I'm gonna be packing up." The real estate became the most valuable thing that Horn and Hardart had. Great real estate throughout New York City, and they leveraged that real estate by franchising. I think he felt like the company and its core and its soul was being gutted, and its spirit. ♪ ♪ It had been not just a business, it was a point of view. It was almost a philosophy, which these gentlemen, Mr. Horn and Mr. Hardart, had embraced and projected through these places. Not just making money for themselves, but really providing the public with what they needed at the same time. And I think the Automat proved that there doesn't have to be a contradiction between those two notions, and these people expected this to last forever. ♪ ♪ I came in at the tail end of the Automat. I had gone to the Automats many times during my lifetime, and here I was in the position of being the undertaker converting the Automat into Burger Kings and other restaurants. Horn and Hardart, Burger King, Arby's. - Yup. - Bojangles. Bojangles, I remember. - Mark Twain and Goodbody's. - Hmm. There I am, and this is my little crew, right here. John was in charge of maintenance. He was in charge of construction. He was in charge of everything. And John was sort of reluctant about moving forward because he had a sentimental attachment. What he had before was beauty. What he had before was elegance, versus what I was creating. I was creating nuts and bolts, and he was wine and flowers. But the people that were now sitting around the table making decisions were not Automat people. They were fast food people. I was moving ahead, and I was part of progress. I appreciate the old, but you have to move forward. The Automat was archaic at this point. [somber music] ♪ ♪ They date way back to 1912. They were the place where nickels went for lunch. They were the Automats, and now there's only one, the last Automat. Horn and Hardart's on 42nd street where the Third Avenue El used to cast a shadow. My mother brought me here when I was a little girl. I brought my children here. I had one friend who... who loved the macaroni and cheese. She was a little bit hefty. I used to sit there, and at nighttime, all night, because I had no place to go. You know, I was one of the homeless, and I used to sit in there, but they never threw us out or anything. Oh, forget about it, are you kiddin' me? Baked beans were the best. A nickel, no? You don't get nothing for a nickel today. These days, the Horn and Hardart Company is mainly concerned with its much faster food franchises, operating more than 250 Arby's, Burger Kings, and Bojangles. People think the Automat was a precursor to fast food. I wouldn't have called it fast food. Fast food is more simplified, and that has to do with speed. The Automat was about many things, but it was not about speed. Horn and Hardart, you knew what you were going to get. Fast service? Yes. But Horn and Hardart was not fast food. We were above all about good quality. You don't go to McDonald's for top-quality food. And Horn and Hardart also had a much wider range of foods. I'm sure you've heard in your interviews, people thinking about Horn and Hardart beef pies or Horn and Hardart creamed spinach or Horn and Hardart chocolate pudding, to Horn and Hardart this, that, or the other thing. A vast variety of... - Carl liked baked beans. We both loved baked beans. He loved cream spinach, I liked cream spinach, but mostly, we really loved the pies. ♪ ♪ The strawberry rhubarb... great crust. Great tartness in the rhubarb. The strawberries were sweetened with sugar. If we didn't have that, we settled for an apple pie, which was also very good. Lemon meringue not only looked big, but you could smash your face into it. Chocolate pudding pie, which only came in the winter. Carl mentioned, probably, the chocolate pudding pie with the... with the cream. He liked that. We waited patiently all year for it. That was the best pie. Really, it was nothing like their coconut custard pie. It was truly heaven. I mean, how could anybody even think of putting together the coconut and the custard and the cream and... coconut custard pie. God made that. [swanky music] ♪ ♪ I think this was the very last Automat. That's the one on 42nd Street and Third Avenue. The last place I closed out. They said close that one down yourself personally. And that completed my cycle. The door's slammed shut on a piece of New York restaurant history as Horn and Hardart closed the last of its famous Automats in Midtown Manhattan. In years past, there were more than 40 Automats scattered all around town, but as fast food restaurants proliferated in Midtown, the popularity of the chain lost favor with the public, and now it's gone forever. [solemn music] ♪ ♪ That was the end, and it was too bad, because it was such a great experiment. ♪ ♪ It had some style, and it was different. The marble, the brass, the floors, the pillars, the chatter, the coffee. It was the Automat. And even though it was beautiful, it... it can't work again because of the logistics and the economics of today. Won't allow anything that simple, naive, and eloquent and beautiful to flourish again. ♪ ♪ It was part of my youth that I really loved. I loved the Automat. I wish somebody could bring it back, but I don't know... That lady isn't there anymore who can give you 20 nickels, so... ♪ ♪ They should have never closed. I had a warehouse loaded with the equipment with the key. I think I have a key. I wonder if the stuff is still there yet. I'm talking about a load. [wondrous music] ♪ ♪ - Life changes. Things change. We all get a little older, but the older you get, the more you reflect back on, you know, what came in the beginning, and the Horn and Hardarts and the Automats of the world. It was a remarkable institution that meant a lot to those of us who are New Yorkers or those in Philadelphia that had the same experience. It took a while for society to get it right. Even when I moved to Washington, D.C. in 1980, many of the clubs were closed to women. So my practice was, I wouldn't speak at any venue that didn't admit people without regard to race, gender. People from all walks of life. One of the great things about being a historian of the Automat is the reaction that people have when I mention it. Big smile blossoms across their face as, suddenly, they're cast back to the days when they were getting their pie or a cup of coffee out of that dolphin head. Those little knobs and doors were a gimmick, but the place became something different. From Edward Hopper's painting of the isolated woman to my grandfather sitting in the Horn and Hardart, it became a place that everybody could go to. The generosity of spirit was sublime, and people got that. And as a result, they owned the Automat. They felt a very strong affection for it. Horn and Hardart was about the people, and I'm glad to have been part of it and part of this documentary. High five. Horn and Hardart rocks. [laughs] It seems very much like the... the Automat was a melting pot and kind of an equalizer of its time, and I... I thank you so much for taking the time to... to meet with me. You're more than welcome. I think this is a wonderful project. - So I wonder if you think it... if it still lives on, and I wonder of what you think... What the message or the lesson can be learned from this. You know my feelings. I remain very loyal to the concept of what Horn and Hardart was. Could you maybe think of some modern reincarnations? Where... where do you see that kind of idealism today? Well, I think the idealism was infused into the lives of the people who experienced the Automat. In terms of institutions today, I wonder. Starbucks? This is a picture of the Automat that I keep on a wall in my office as a constant reminder of the theater, the romance, and the sense of discovery that existed in the Automat. ♪ ♪ I think the principles that they pioneered and the ideals that they had are still alive today.
