THE COP IN BLUE JEANS Don't get offended. Go on! It was a compliment! Stop that thief! Stop that dog! Stop that dog! Where are the guards? Stop that thief! I got you! - Who's that madman? - Giraldi from anti-mugging squad. Have some oranges! I can't take it any more! Why didn't you stop before? I didn't do anything, inspector. I want a lawyer. Put your hands down, don't be smart. You can't fool me. Don't get angry. How do you want my hands? Put one in front and one behind you. - How can I walk now? - Like this! You'll go like this all the way to prison. That'll teach you! Leave him to me. Stop, police! Are you going to shoot me? Don't play dumb, baron. You were keeping watch for jelly jaws. I don't even know him. I was just going for a ride. At 100 km per hour! Here, have these bracelets. Hurry up! I'll take yours, mine's broken down. It's the most ridiculous thing I've heard in police history. I had to put my gun down to put the handcuffs on him. They go between the belt and the legs. Do I have to tell you everything? An anti-mugging squad officer getting done like this... it's... - Now what'll I do? - I'll tell you. Get a book and write 100 times: I'm a dickhead" I'm a dickhead... In clear handwriting, so everyone can read it. Gargiulo, I have to write a report. The baron's got you into trouble. He has an alibi as usual. He was admitted to hospital. I know how you found him. With a drip in his arm and a thermometer up his ass. He's been in bed for 7 days. There's a nurse and six patients as witnesses. I'll get that son of a bitch. Come and look at this joke from the baron. To the anti-mugging squad with many thanks no one saw anybody. He'd popped out and then he found it here. Let's have cheesy stand near the bike' let's take his picture and write: "From one dickhead to another ." What matters is that I got the bike back. Trentini, did you question jelly jaws? He said juventus is going to win the championship again. Do you expect them to tell you who the dealer is? They won't talk. You remember when I caught you twenty years ago? - Sure. - You were a young lad then. I wanted to rip your ear off, but there was no way you'd tell me the name of the dealer that bought your stolen goods. Once you're in with that lot, you can't talk. We have to get the dealers. I hate them because they don't take the risks! They even have clean records. Tozzi, how would these thieves sell their goods without dealers? How clever you are! It's them we have to get, not just the thieves. Otherwise, it's useless. My wife's made spaghetti‚Äù you want to come round? Thanks" but I'm meeting a girl. Give your wife my regards. - Good morning, auntieteresa. - Hi' Nico. Happy birthday! I'm 74 today. You look twenty years younger. What? I was ten years older than your mom. God bless her. She was my best friend. They used to call us sisters. We were the best whores in the district! This is your present. It's the latest portable radio. It's transoceanic. Push this and you'll hear half the world. I bet you bought it. You'd have stolen it once. You were called the pirate. You could've been great. But you changed. I did what I wanted to do. - You were handsome too. - Aren't I now? Not exactly. Bye' I'm going to... Don't say it. He's a cop, he's a dodgy one. I'm not doing anything wrong. I sell souvenirs to tourists. You sell bogus stuff. Watch out, you start off doing little cons... Then you go on to do theft and robberies. - Isn't working better? - Yeah, yeah... Is that your nephew? My nephew? He's my husband! We've been married for three months. - He's your husband? - Yes and he's jealous too! You're really something! You're well-worn but worn well! An old hen makes good broth! Hi, this is Giovanna. Can we meet up? It's been a month now. Don't policemen ever get a break? - Here's my number... - I remember it. Lieutenant Sheridan... This is a special message for inspector Nico giraldi: Fuck you, fuck you... Grottaferrata, again! He even wastes money to phone me. You really are a jerk. This is ballarin, I've been following the baron for four hours' he entered his friend's house at half past midnight. I'm in bar Olympia. That's number 24, via del biscione. I'm sure he'll come out to go hunting. Hold on" I'll just feed serpico then I'll be there. Come on, eat. Open up, it's me... giraldi. - You're sure it's him? - Yes' we'll get him this time. It's that door. You're going to stay much longer? I'm tired and I have to open up at 5 tomorrow. It's market day and the stallholders come here for coffee. What a pain he is! He's had one grappa and six milkshakes in one hour. He's had 12 sandwiches' 25 doughnuts and 3 cakes. That's almost 10 thousand liras. I skipped dinner because of the baron. I don't care! My wife'll be worried. At least sort my licence out. I can't close my bar on Sundays! - Shut up. - Monday would be better. Stop being a pain in the ass! Fair enough. Make me a cappuccino. If fanfani were tall, cabarets may as well close down. - Everyone jokes about him. - And that one about the soldiers? If he becomes president, he'll shorten their legs! - What was that? - It was a rotten egg. - Look at this! - Rascals I They've snatched a fur coat. Bag snatchers don't get a lot from me. I never carry anything with me. I put my jewels in my bra while I was coming out of the club. There they are. You should've tried again, he'd have fallen for it. Quick, let's be quiet. - Where are we going? - To monte sacro. Take a couple of these. I'm slow enough as it is, if I take them I'll be worse. Go left after the crossing. That's where garba and the chink are. It seems they've got the good stuff. That's garba and the chink. That's a stolen car. No, fiat gave to it them for publicity reasons... I haven't got a light. I've got one. Go slow here, the police are always here. My license has expired. Why aren't your lights working? Your license, please. I'm tailing a car. We're cops. - Show me your badge. - They're getting away! And if you're trying to get away? - This is all we need. - I'm just doing my job. Are you showing me your dick? This is where my ID is! Goodnight and thanks for dinner. Shut up! Come here, keep still! Is this all you've got? What's here? Sorry but we can't trust anyone. We're carabinieri. Right. Help! You're happy now, officer birdbrain? It's the cops, let's go! Help! I'm a cop! What happened? There were four of them, they went that way. They beat me up and stole everything. Calm down now, we're here now. It's that son of a bitch giraldi! Let's go to the yards, quick! Take the road that goes to the marshes. It's closed off. You get the babbler! I've got nothing to do with this. My lawyer's name is michelotti. You're not funny' father Christmas! Hey' chink! Chinky! You're playing hide and seek? I'll get angry then I'll shoot. Come on out, I don't want to play games. I'm tired. This is the end of the line' dickhead. You can't shoot me" I'm unarmed. Come here then. You can joke because you're holding the gun. You're right' you know. Let's pretend I haven't got a gun. I'm so scared... What are you? The dragon's wrath? - You had enough? - Yes' stop it. Put that down, you'll hurt yourself. You're calmer now? No, not the lime! - Who buys your stolen goods? - I don't know. - You know the dealer? - Baron deals with it all. He knows them. I just know the middleman. I think they call him the Nancy. I like you when you behave. The stolen goods were in the car. Not bad. Take it to the station, I'm going to the hospital. Are you injured? No, I'll go after the baron before he admits himself to hospital. Get inside, you arseholes! What... are you leaving? I've got to take a piss! Get up, you arsehole! Who are you? St Anthony from friuli, patron Saint of arseholes! I'm sick. I've got kidney failure, my gall bladder's had it, what do you want? He's very sick, he's got worse. But half an hour ago he was running around! He was admitted four days ago. This is his medical report. He's never left the bed. Someone who's bedridden doesn't have a fast heartbeat. He's got high blood pressure. He's even got a drip. I'll give him a drip... But with acid in it. You be careful too. Hello, mangiagalli. You got anything to say? Maybe he's a bit scared. You wanted to speak to me... Things aren't going well for you... You said, 'if I get my hands on that idiot Shelly... I'll give him a beating., right? Well... the idiot's right in front of you. You changed your mind? You've been told a lie, Mr. Shelly. I just said it wasn't fair. I sorted out that big deal. 5 million dollars', I was the middleman. A hundred thousand dollars seemed too little to you, right? I was hoping for a bit more. I think that's too much for a moany son of a bitch. I'm the one that takes the risk... By having an areshole like you work for me. What are you going to do? I didn't do anything! Leave me alone! It's all lies! Chuck him in the river, at ponte flaminio. He'll just be another dead body found in Rome, no one will care. Not even the papers mention it now. What a pity! I'd really like to buy a dog. But I live by myself and it'd be a problem. I can't take it into the office. - Miss cattaneo? - Yes? I'm giraldi from the anti-mugging squad. We met the other night at your house. You're the policeman that caught those villains. I only saw you briefly. I'd have liked to stop and help you. - Are they waiting for you? - They're my colleagues. We only have half an hour for a quick snack. - Where are they going? - There's a great cafe near here. I know a terrible one. All right. See you later. We publish important editions, essays, special editions. Recently we published a wonderful book by Thomas mann. - Thomas who? - Thomas mann. You don't care much for editrice europa. When I have the time, I read Mickey mouse. I haven't thanked you yet. I got everything back thanks to you. I'd like to return the favour. - There is a way. - How? I have to always eat tinned or frozen food... And you'd like to... I'd like to come to dinner at your house. Tonight' at nine. Please don't say no. I'd be offended. Thanks from the police. It was a mugging, they got away on a motorbike. - Mr. Shelly, are you all right? - I'm fine. Call the police. There's no point. There was nothing valuable in the briefcase. Just some papers. - We'd better go inside. - Thanks, but there's no need. Why won't he report it to the police? - How much is it? - 5 million dollars. - How much? - Almost 4 billion liras. Bloody hell! This is dangerous business" it's not for us. He's right, it's dirty money. Let's take some and give the police the rest. Don't be stupid. Taking some is like taking all of it. Let's not shit ourselves right away. We can change it a bit at a time, in another city. We mustn't say a word to anyone. I'll hide the stuff. Lie low for a few days. Meanwhile, I'll think of a plan. - When shall we meet again? - On Sundays, at the snooker club. Help! Help, they want to kill me! Stop it! - Are you his accomplice? - No, I'm a... I'm a cop! Do I have to shoot at you? We'll teach that swine! You have St. Anthony from the ditches to thank. - Who's that? - Patron Saint of sons of bitches. They should cut his hands off. You should leave him to us. Don't come round here again. If you tell me who your dealer is, I'll let you go. I don't know any dealers. - So you give your stuff to the poor? - Will you really let me go? I swear on that bitch of your sister. His name's the truffler, he lives above the pub in via ripetta. Off you go. If I catch you at it again, you'll have brown pants. - Meaning? - You'll be shitting your pants. - I'm sorry. - At last! I'm really sorry. What time does your watch say? What about yours? I wear my watch on my wrist now, not in my bra. When you got asked the time, what did you say, a quarter to tits? The dinner's gone cold. The candles have burnt down. I don't need any candles. How odd to wake up to someone speaking Russian! What about waking up with someone with a hat, three jumpers and funny socks on then? I get really freezing after doing certain things. You poor thing. Why were you speaking Russian? Because editrice europa has just bought a novel by kuniakov. It'll shed light on many dark sides of Soviet life and politics. It'll arrive illegally and I've got the contacts. - I didn't get any of that. - I'm a literary agent. A sort of 007 for books? Sort of. You want a coffee? That'd be great. I'll make it right away. I have to go. Don't you ever rest? It's Sunday. No, I'm working for myself today. I'm watching the football with Colombo and gargiulo. Are you a football fan? No, but I have to catch this guy that leaves me phone messages. There's no harm in doing that. The man I'm looking for leaves me 45 seconds of swearwords. That's not on. You know anything about that briefcase that was stolen? I haven't got it. The baron's got it. Tell the truth! What's the baron's name? Pertinari achille. - Where does he live? - I swear I don't know. You'd better go. Four big guys are giving gipo a real beating. They're after the dollars. They're nasty, we'd better hide. Call the Nancy. I'll be in touch. The referee's an arsehole! That was a penalty! - Is this seat free? - Yes. - Rececconi's playing well today. - He's the best. - I told lenzini about him. - So you're lazio's advisor? - D'amico's good. - I told lenzini about him too. How clever of you! We're good friends. You're colleagues. You're a constructor too? You're all loaded! I don't feel well. I love lazio to death! What's wrong? - A friend of mine died like this. - You need anything? I'm off" say hello to lenzini from me. Goodbye. I'll see him tonight. Come on lazio! It's really full! It's got to be loaded! Where is it? Here it is! 20 thousand liras. What a stingy constructor I he had to be a lazio fan! I want to know his name. Gaetano bozzetti' he's a builder. Constructor... what a bullshitter I I'll Chuck this down the loo. This is an announcement for Mr. Rossi' the grottaferrata thief. I'm inspector giraldi. Just hope the wallet doesn't go lost or you'll be in the shit. Come here! Fuck you! Fuck you! You're angry over something so small? You need a good brainwashing session. You beat the life out of me' I wish you'd given me a brainwash. I'll do it then. No! I'm allergic... Attention please: Mr. Bozzetti can collect his wallet from the tevere stand entrance. I've had my wallet stolen, bloody hell! Your wallet gets stolen and you take it out on me. Attention please: Mr. giraldi is kindly requested to go to the press stand's entrance for an urgent message. Where were you, inspector? I got the guy that told me to fuck off on the phone. I handed him in to a carabiniere... Superintendent tozzi says to get to the snooker hall, there's a body. We have to bury it? Time of death: 3.30 pm. Caused by the blows to his head. I had arrested him six months ago for a mugging at campo de' Fiori. He was set free attending the trial. He'd have been better off in prison. We've got a problem here. No one witnessed the crime. Those four guys sent everyone out. It might be a settling of accounts. But what accounts could a small-time thief like gipo have? You can never know. What do you think? I dunno! This has got nothing to do with me, it's for the murder squad. Don't be like that. Wouldn't you like a promotion? You always want to run after thieves? Why? What do you do? Muggers are your field. You know them all. Couldn't a dealer have wanted him murdered? Could be. Who did gipo work with? He was friends with the baron. That's a start. You know where to find him? Of course I do. - Park that and come with me. - I'm working. - I have to X-ray a patient. - I'll give you an X-ray. You're crazy, what do you want? Here you are, Dante ranucci, better known as the ox from testaccio. Now you're a good guy and work at the riuniti hospital in Rome. But the money's not enough so to boost your wages... You deal in amphetamines, right? What? I swear blind I don't! Why do you want to be blind? Everyone knows you're the pill dealer for the bad boys in Rome. And your cousin, the baron, helps you. You give him alibis in return. What? - Should I clean your ears out? - My cousin really is sick. Yeah, he's on his deathbed... What's happened to him? Nothing yet, but gipo's dead. Gipo? Holy lord! He worked with the baron, right? When chink and babbler got arrested, they got together. - My cousin, gipo and othello. - Your cousin's been here? I haven't seen anyone. Maybe he's hiding because he knows he'll be next. They must have got some dealer's back up. - Who did they sell their stuff to? - I haven't got a clue. - Watch out or I'll cut your arse. - I don't know that lot. If you hear from him, call me. It's for your and his own good. Will I be in trouble too? You're shitting yourself, aren't you? Come on. If you want to keep your job, you have to help me and be on my side. Tell me about othello? He lives in prenestina but he hides at a friend's house. - Who's this friend? - I think her name's Adelaide. Am I really in trouble? Take some pills, you look a bit off colour. Help! They want to kill othello. There are four of them! I'll go call the police! Stop! Police! Let's run! I've got nothing to do with it! The drainpipe's coming off! Don't worry, I'll help you! I can't hold on anymore! - Try! - I can't! I didn't know those bastards. I've never seen them before. I put the chain on the door, but they forced their way in. Othello managed to run away down the stairs. Did othello know them? I don't know! I hadn't seen him in ages. He had to lie low for a while. He'd done a mugging with... - The baron. - The baron and gipo. He said it was a big job, but he didn't tell me the rest. Did othello make any calls recently? Yes, he called a disco last night... I think it was the coccodrillo. He spoke to a certain Nancy. - You're sure it was the coccodrillo? - Yes. He said it was a big job... And that if it went well... - Where's the phone? - In the Porter's office. It's you, at last! No, I've got something on tonight. Could you cancel it? I need a favour. It's not dinner again. It's about... I can't tell you right now. Ten o'clock at 48, via ontani? What for? There's a disco called coccodrillo there. Do cops dance too? Occasionally. I bet you're eighteen years old. How do you know? Because my friend's son is nine and he's half an idiot. What's wrong? You dress like a lady but you'll always be a whore! - What? - Let's go have a drink. Play along with me. Take your money, bitch! Let's go! A gin and tonic. A little lemon, lots of tonic. - I'd like... - Shut up, you're not drinking! Otherwise you won't work properly. - You have to pay first. - Too right. Get your money out, come on! I'll have a packet of ms ciggies too. You know why they're called ms? Ms: Mucky shit! Don't you find it funny? I pissed myself when I heard it! It's excellent! It's late. It's almost midnight, shall we go? - What did you say? - It's late. Fuck off, you're the one that has to go. People are coming out of the cinema now, turned on and wanting fun. Otherwise some other bitch will swipe your place. Move it! Move your arse I I'm broke, leave me some cash. Move it, hurry up! I went to high heavens to get you that job! Damn you and the day I met you! She's a young girl. She could earn loads, but she needs to loosen up. I'm fed up with this job. It's a hard life. Hey, you got a light? What were you saying? Being a pimp isn't my job. I'm in trouble now because I've got this stuff to get rid of... But I can't remember who did business with baronetto. You know achille? Sure' I was in prison with him for two years. - Where? - Banged up! Achilles in hiding. I can help you. I need someone to get rid of some stuff for me. He gave me a name but I can't remember it. What are you selling? Uncut jewels. Expensive stuff from Milan. When achille's got stuff like that, I send him to the horseman. His name's bagolini. He's got a freight company in monte testaccio. Tell him Nancy sent you. Thanks. I'll come back to you later. Don't worry, I'll get my share from the horseman. - Can I buy you a drink? - I'm teetotal. Never mind. If you want to be nice to me' we could go out together one night. You're not having my arse! - Is the horseman here? - He's in there. I'll just be a minute! It's 14-carat gold. I'l give you 10, 000 liras. - It's almost 300 grams! - Come off it! - Let's say 30, 000 with the radio. - I don't deal with that stuff. Leave it here if you want. Let's say 15, 000 for the lot. You mean bastard! Call me what you want, I don't care! So 15.000 then? 15.000 curses to you and your whore of a wife! Thanks. Take care guys. These kids are all the same! In my days there was respect. I'm all yours, baron. What have you got for me, achille? I have to leave the country, I've got family in South Africa. You want me to post you there? You heard about gipo and othello? Yes, but what's it got to do with you? We picked on the wrong people... murderers. I did the job with gipo and othello. We snatched a briefcase from an American man. There were 5 million liras inside. Othello was right. He wanted to give it to the police. 5 million dollars? Are you kidding me? Bloody hell! They're after me. I can't hide all my life. I have to go away. You can help me. You know people abroad, you could change the money. I'll give it to you for 50 million liras. Are you off your head? That money's a passport to the grave! It can't be used for quite some time. - Can you help me? - Me? - Where will I get 50 million liras? - You'll get it. I only have about 4 million available in cash. What a son of a bitch! I know. Let's do this. I'll give you 4 million cash and 6 million in traveller's cheques. If they're stolen ones, who'll change them? I will. You're not getting away, baron! I want to know the whole story! I'll send you to hospital now! You had the bank of America on you? I don't know this man, I've never seen him before. - You're bagolini? - Nice to meet you! I've given you the briefcase and the cash. I've owned up to the mugging. You want me to confess to other crimes? I'll only feel safe once I'm in prison. Was the man you mugged at the snooker hall? - I don't know. I left when othello told me about gipo. He ordered the murder. He didn't report the mugging. He told the hotel Porter the briefcase contained personal belongings and unimportant papers. If he reported it, he would have to say why he had all that money. Maybe he needed it to buy drugs or pay a ransom. We'll know soon. Trentini is checking if the money is marked. What do you know about this guy? According to the hotel Porter, his name's Norman shelley and he's American. He's got a fixed room at the hotel, but he's hardly ever there. He only comes on Saturdays or Sundays. It's a good place for weekend shags and dodgy deals! - I've had the money checked. - Well? It's the ransom money paid for zagari, the jeweller. - 5 million in 1, 000 notes. - Right. - It's in all the papers. - Zagari's been free for 20 days. I saw his interview on TV. Poor othello, he knew it was dirty money. It's dirty money, but not for the zagari family. We'll have to give it back to them. You'll make a big mistake if you give the money back to the zagairis. - Why? - Don't you see? The money was going to end up in the hands of a slimy dealer! - You're obsessed! - Yes'l am! What's zagari's kidnapping got to do with these dealers? You want me to tell you? The papers call it recycling but really it's receiving stolen goods! They use the marked money to pay for the stolen goods. I've told you already. If we don't get rid of these people, the robberies and kidnappings will continue. We can't let them get away now! - What's your plan? - I'll tell you. We're the only ones that know about this. The horseman knows but he's in prison. The zagaris can wait. Instead of steak, they can eat bread I'm sure the American guy receives the stolen dollars. He'll know he's got the money. - What do I care? I'll be in prison! - Really? But I'll be stupid enough to get you out! I don't want to end up like gipo and othello! Don't worry. Just remember you owe me one. Shut up and do what I tell you! - But they'll kill me! - No, they won't. If they know you have the money , you'll be as safe as houses. Trentini, let's keep the money for now. Listen, Nico. I want to listen to you, even if it's not very clear. Two men have died. Shall we leave it to the murder squad? What about my promotion? Do I have to chase thieves forever? Holy cow! - Serpico's pissed on me! - Who's serpico? It's him, he hides in my pocket! He's a mouse from the estate. He's an orphan thanks to the disinfestations! See you. I've seen it all now! Why are you so sad tonight? I'm in the shit! - Doesn't that make you happy? - I'm up to my ears init! - You know the Nancy? - Yes, he's at the bar. - You're the Nancy? - Only to my friends. - Can I buy you a drink? - Yes. - An orange juice. - An orange juice and a double whisky. I don't like spirits. Come with me. Let's sit down. You know achille pertinari? The baron? He's a friend of mine. My friends and me have been looking him for him. - But we can't find him. - He's ill, he's in hospital. Poor thing, he's ill! I'd like to visit him. Room 37, urology ward. We'll bring him some fruit. Does he like oranges? Yes, but how about a banana for me? Rome is a great football team! Rome is just lucky, that's all! - What's wrong! - I'm scared to death! You want to drink? No. There's a dead man there! - Take him away. - The dead don't harm anyone. It's trentini, you hear me? Over. - We hear you, go on. - They took him away. Over and out. Come on, let's go! Someone might see the ambulance. Wake up, baron! Look at me. We know each other, right? Answer me! You stole my briefcase, didn't you? I don't remember my clients. What do you want? You're a bright and clever boy. You know we don't mess around. If you don't want to end up like your friends, you'd better tell me where the briefcase is. The briefcase? I... Baron, I know you have it. You're too smart to have spent those dollars. All right, then. How can I be sure you'll let me go? You can't. Why should I kill you if I get my money back? If I'd already got it back, your friends would still be alive. All right then. I'll take you to where the briefcase is. But only you and me will go. These three have to wait in the car where I tell them to. You can't lay down conditions! All right, kill me now then! What do I care? That money will get eaten by rats! All right, we'll do as you say. Tell him where to go. Go towards aurelia, then I'll tell you from there. They've just gone by. Get ready. We'll be there soon. We're here. - Where are we? - It's an abandoned brickyard. No one ever comes here. Now let's do as we said. They have to wait here. You and me will go alone. But first I want to search you to see if you're armed. Don't get out, he's fooled us! What did I do? What did you do? Why can't they wait in the car? I don't know, because... If they're outside, they're a target. They'd be safe in the car! Why are you talking about targets? I could be wrong' but we'll come back another time. Come on, let's go! No, what are you doing? Don't shoot! I'm on your side! He's getting away! That's him, don't let him get away! Police! Get out! - I have to go to work! - I need your Jeep. What will I tell the boss? Don't go too fast! It's fragile! - Where are you going? - Who's that man that just went in? - Why do you want to know? - I have to speak to him. The public entrance is there, but it's early yet. We're open from 9 to 12. Go smarten yourself up. All right, but who is that man? That man? You want to speak to someone you don't even know? Yes. So? When Columbus discovered America he didn't know what it was called! You want to end up in prison? - Are you a cop? - Yes. I'm one of your superiors, inspector giraldi. - Sorry, inspector! - What's that bastard's name? - But he's American! - You never saw an American bastard? I'll be back later. Come in. Yes? Richard Russo. I was expecting to find Norman Shelly. Either this desk isn't yours, or you have two names! One for the embassy and the other for hotel Byron! My name's Richard. J. Russo. I don't know this... shelley. What's the purpose of your visit? I've brought you this. It's a part of my car. It came off when I hit a lamppost. How kind of you to bring it to me. Where was it? - up your mother's arse! If you'd excuse me, I have work to do. Would you mind leaving? What did you say? I asked you to leave. What's going on? Call a doctor. Mr. Russo's balls hurt. - Can I help you? - No. I'm glad to know all the slaps you gave me that night at the disco were for areason! Yes I we got shelley. Or is his name Russo? What did he do? - He laundered dollars. - How? He'd buy marked dollars and he'd take them abroad in his diplomatic briefcase. He bought 5 million for 1 million. - Did you arrest him? - No' he was sent back to America. He'll stand trial in America and I might have to testify. - Do you speak english? - Yes' but I don't understand it. Lock it, there are thieves round here. Listen, that kaganof... Kuniakof! Yes. How will he get the manuscript to you? A pilot arriving from Moscow will give it to me. You have no idea how complicated it was to get him here! My editor paid quite a packet. But it's worth it. This kuniakofs brave! - There he is! - Kuniakof? No, the pilot. Flight number 833 to Moscow. Boarding gate number 35. I'm so excited. Help me open it. These are old newspapers! - You've been tricked! - Yes. I knew it. Kuniakof is under strict surveillance. - The police must have found out. - Maybe it was the pilot. No way. Maybe someone swapped it during the flight. Look! Gate 35 I - that man! - Is it kuniakof? No, the one with the briefcase. The man with the grey hat. He's going to Moscow! It's too late now. Because... - Start it up! - I'm meeting a girl! - Get a move on! - Where are we going? To mug someone! - Nico! - Hi. It looks interesting' but I can't read it. It's Russian. - This is kuniakofs manuscript! - Yes. - How did you get it? - I stole it! Give me a kiss! You're the best! - Nonsense. - How did you get into the car? - I had locked it. - I can open everything! How did you do it? You want to teach me how to steal? You tell her Serpico!
