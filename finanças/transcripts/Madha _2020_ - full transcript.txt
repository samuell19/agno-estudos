Good morning, boys Good morning, sir I am your guest lecturer for today I am a psychiatrist My name is Balasubramaniam We will be discussing an interesting topic today Now can anyone tell me.... What is the most dangerous weapon known to mankind? Nuclear weapon? Atomic Bomb? Well gentlemen, the most dangerous weapon known to mankind is... The Human Mind Gentlemen, let's play a small game This game is called, concentration Think about your favourite.... ....God or person for two minutes But, that's not all Like all games, this game also has its rules Now close your eyes and don't think about anything else Your time starts.... Now! I said, close your eyes Well gentlemen Now you can all open your eyes ....and I can say with certainity.... ....that you all failed in this game Our mind is it's own master If it wishes to, it can meditate for an hour But if you order, even two minutes will become difficult Like I said.... ....mind is the most dangerous weapon ever You know why? Because you cannot control it Human mind Is as mysterious as God The space that we give for pleasures and comfort... ....is more than that we give for knowledge Once upon a time survival instinct was more But now instinct for comfort is more Which is why.... ....our human race, as it evolves is becoming lazier So our mind... is always seeking to find more comforts Sir... Sir, if our mind runs behind comforts, why is it a dangerous weapon? Hello, sir Let's go, sir Arjun sir.... ....which year did you say? 1992 April 22nd Munna, found the file Four shots [colleagues cheering up for Nisha] Come on! Two shots at a time.... Oh my, God....

Arjun Oh my, God This is... This is beautiful! There is nothing purer than mother's love I didn’t know what other gifts I should give you... Did you like it? Arjun... I grew up not... ...knowing what mother’s love is I don't even know how my... ...mother and father look Someone left me at an orphanage when I was 3 years old Never call yourself an orphan again I will always be there for you Dreams have come to a standstill... New life has taken shape... My heart is longing only for you... You have flooded my thoughts... Even while I am awake and breathing... You are the truth in... ...the void of my life I don't know how to believe all of this? All these surprises have taken me aback... There is no stopping of my feelings with new hopes... My heart beats to the sound of your name now... This is where I grew up You know... ...this window is my opening into the world I saw and learned about the world from here You’ve come into my life like a boon and changed the meaning of it... You have become an inseparable bond that I hold close to my heart... A lonely life was nothing but only a burden till you arrived... Despite being a question, you've made me your answer and rejuvenated my soul... As we become one, this moment feels like a rebirth... Don’t know how long will this happiness last... I'm so happy that I hold no more desires from life... My imaginations have taken wings... My hopes have got a new meaning... I've seen love for the first time Throw them some money and get the job done Okay... make it quick What is the progress? Stage one is done Stage two will begin Two more weeks to go In my previous book, "Is it crime? or madness?"... ...I've mentioned a point clearly 85% of the crimes in this world are committed by madmen When you loose control your emotions... ...you are mad ...you are insane You have no control on what you are doing But soon, the madness is gone But, the crime remains Because, the deal is done And do you know, when you loose control over your emotions? When you are in love And madly in love, with material Human or lust Sir... I am in love with a girl. So, am I a criminal according to you? Sit down Okay... quiet everybody No laughing at each other You know when you are in love... Your heart is the strongest But your mind is at its weakest One can go crazy beyond imagination when in... ...love, because of emotions like "insecurities" When you were waiting outside, I deliberately started the class late Have you noticed? Most of you looked restless and irritated The human mind can’t handle the fact that, it is getting late So it triggers craziness in you So be calm Agitation is nothing but 100 percent madness There is a thin line between a normal man and a mad man A small event can throw you from here to there There is no call or text since morning... and you wanted to meet all of a sudden. All OK? Nisha... I got a good movie project Will be shooting outdoor for two weeks. I'm flying tomorrow morning What is this? You didn't even tell me before hand All of a suddden... ...what is this movie project about? How many times do I tell you, that movies are my passion I got a good project and I took it... Arjun... I didn’t mean to hurt you. All I meant is that... Enough! I thought you’d be happy to hear this news. Didn’t expect you to spoil my mood Look, I am really sorry okay But the fact that I’ll not see you for two weeks... ...is more painful. I didn’t mean to hurt you. That's okay It's just two weeks I will call you every day I know, I am going to miss you. But I can't miss this offer. I understand I'm sorry I will miss you Take care of yourself Nisha Nisha, this project is already done right? We are currently working on the airlines' project Whatever...

You always keep doing some or the other nuisance Terrible disturbance Am I mad to come out like this in a towel? Watchman… go there and check out There is nothing inside See... there's nothing What is this nuisance in the middle of the night? Have you gone crazy? Sir, it's high time we complain to her owner.

Get up... let's go Don't worry... calm down... you will be fine... Come let's go... I will book a cab I will come with you... don't worry Sir... The job is done There are some trigger points, that drive you crazy all of a sudden These trigger points may be different, for different person They can be very silly But all the same. They can be dangerous. Sir... What is the primary trigger that turns our mind dangerous? Good question, gentlemen... Secrets! The secrets that you hide from everyone is the primary trigger. They develop your complexity And finally, if you cannot control the emotions surrounding your secrets ...you turn wild In a broader sense, these secrets... ...are the crimes committed by our mind So remember... ...never reveal your secrets to anyone I thought you will feel better, if I take you out for shopping I don't know... I'm just missing Arjun He isn’t even calling me And he is not picking up my calls either Strange things are happening with me every day That’s okay, you are thinking too much It's a condom!

Yeah Look nisha This is the second nuisance case against you I already let you go, when your neighbours have complained I'm giving you one more chance, just because you are a girl This is your last and final warning Sir, Nisha is mentally disturbed these days due to some personal issues I assure you that, no such things will happen again.

I will delay the reports by two weeks. Finish your plan by then And Arjun.... hurry up OK Sir, an important news Recently a girl has been sent here from the first base We performed drug test on her And she hasn't reacted to the drug But another girl who underwent the same test died How old is she? could be around 26 to 28. we already sent her samples for testing Do one thing... test all the drugs we have for testing on her No, wait a minute. test the drugs that are in the research stage too Are you sure sir?

I will give you a number, his name is Arjun. Can you call and explain my situation to him? Sorry, I can't help you with this I'm not mad They are torturing me unnecessarily here Will you say the same if your daughter had been in my place? Okay.... Let me try Write his number in this diary Thank you! Hello... is it Arjun? I want to speak to you about Nisha, can you meet me immediately? Yeah...near Meridian Cafe Get one tea Gopal? Yes... Arjun? I am a security guard at that mental asylum Nisha gave your number and asked me to call you She is in pain, you should get her out somehow Uncle... Actually creating an impression that Nisha is mad and sending her there was my plan What? I am a journalist, we had to use Nisha to expose the happenings in the asylum Do one thing... What can I do? Take these and give them to Nisha What is all this? Tell her to record all the drug tests and organ tradings happening in that asylum Please help her in this You give these to her today, tomorrow evening I’ll make sure she comes out Did you call him? What happened? Umm... eat... Arjun... Nisha... I'm gonna get you out of that place in two days. Gopal is helping us. The plan is ready... Just follow Gopal's instructions This is Gopal... someone saw me getting in yesterday. I doubt that they are observing me There will be a power cut at 7:30pm today It will take 5 minutes for the generator to start functioning. I will come and talk to you at that time. Thank you! Listen carefully... Arjun is the reason for you to be here What? Yes... he framed you as insane and sent you here Anyways, this isn't important at the moment. But to get out of this place, you got to do what Arjun says. What should I do? Arjun is a journalist, he had to use you to expose this asylum Though the route he chose is wrong, I believe that his intentions are good He gave this camera and asked to record everything... ...that is happening here in these 24 hours I will record everything and give it to you, by the time you escape from here I will help you in this. If you do what Arjun said. You can get out from here in 24 hrs. Be ready by 7:30pm tomorrow Okay? It takes 5 minutes for the generation to start functioning. We should get to the compound wall before that. Hurry up Who is it? It's me gopal What are you doing here at this time? One more patient is dead. I'm taking the body out Can't you wait for the generator? Eyes won't be of any use if it gets late. I have to hurry OK... go What's next? There will be a power cut again. It'll take 5 minutes for the generator to start functioning You have to jump over this wall in that 5 minutes You will find a railway track after a kilometer Another kilometer from there, you will find a mud road Arjun will be waiting there for you in the car... okay? Take this.... be careful! Where is Arjun? That phone doesn't work baby By the way, I've sedated you right... shouldn't you be sleeping for 48hrs!! Oh, I forgot about your immunity... Ahh... Ms. Immunity! Yeah, I forgot How did you even think that you could escape so easily? I don't know why you fascinate me so much You were a small baby when I saw you the first time. I remember you like that. I used to put up medical camps in remote villages and conduct drug tests I think you were 3 years old then We tested a drug-related to infants, on you that day You didn't show any reaction to the drug and I released it into the market I didn't know about your immunity then right! Many kids had to die because of you They seized my companies And put me in jail I learnt everything about you... ...after coming out from the jail Come... let me show you something You see this building? Isn't it beautiful? This is where you were born I've planted a bomb and blasted it Do you see them? I killed them all How did you even survive that blast? huh? I know... I know everything about you Nisha... I need to talk something important with you I'm not a cinematographer... I'm a journalist I work for a shadow reporting agency We got a project from W.H.O to submit a shadow report on a mental asylum I'm leading this project From my research, I learned that they are handpicking... ...orphans and sending them to some other place And they are conducting drug tests on them They are also selling away the blood and organs of the healthy patients This asylum is run by a person called Ravi Verma He was a big pharma industrialist once I and my team were blank, not knowing how to expose this asylum What do we do? I know a doctor who works for the same asylum... ...we can take his help to know what happens inside No Arjun... it's very risky But I know him well, he might help us It's good if we know someone who isn't connected... ...with the asylum, otherwise it is dangerous. No...there is a chance of getting into a problem with new people too It will be correct if we send someone as an inmate Exactly... I concur As an inmate? I hope you know the consequences of sending someone inside Okay... let's think on this During that time, one of my friends who works at police record room called me Hello Arjun, I need to talk to you urgently While digitalizing old records, I found an old burnt diary It is Operation Brahma I learned about many interesting things from that diary It belongs to 1992 I learned that a team of four scientists conducted... ...a secret project called "operation Brahma" They created a genetically engineered test tube baby by altering her DNA They chose scientist Shiksha among them for this operation As per the details, my friend gave me, this diary was found in the... ...records related to an explosion occurred on August 8th 1995. They recovered the dead bodies of the scientists from the explosion. But the baby's dead body was never found. I was curious to know if the baby was dead or alive I started investing this case by myself If we look at the newspapers belonging to that time… 1995 August 5th, a prisoner named Ravi verma, who... ...was a big pharma industrialist got bail. This explosion happened on August 8th On August 9th, a 3-year-old girl was left in front of an orphanage. No one knows who left the girl there. But it was mentioned in the news article, that she had burnt injuries With my friend's help, I collected the details of that baby from the orphanage That baby is none other than you I know your friend Shwetha through a common friend. I met you with her help The very first day I met you, I noticed that you... ...were completetly stable even after taking 11 shots It was confirmed to me that, because of your DNA structure, ...alcohol or any kind of drugs won't show any effect on you The only way to expose that asylum is that someone has to go inside as an inmate I wanted to send you as an inmate as you are immune to all kinds of drugs We shall send Nisha there as an inmate, that is the safest idea Nisha? Your idea is great Arjun, but her safety is very important Arjun, we can succeed if we can bring Nisha out at the right time Leave it to me. I will take care of it One day Dr.Balasubramaniam conducted a guest lecture on the human mind From his lecture I understood that if you can trigger correctly, you can prove a sane person insane With his help, I wanted to apply those triggers on you I went and met him the next day I told him about the asylum, you and operation Brahma This Nisha... ..is my daughter Siksha was my wife I donated the sperm to operation Brahma I am Nisha’s biological father Nisha My love for you was a lie. the truth is, I wanted to... ...send you into the asylum by projecting you as insane I stalked you and planted cameras in your apartment without your knowledge But now, I'm yet to understand when and how I fell in love with you for real! Your innocence, love towards me brought me closer... ...to you, and made me guilty of what I've done to you That's why I wanted to confess everything to you today I have to see my dad Shiksha was a brave woman She always used to say that she wanted to do something for this world She always believed that she was born for a greater purpose in life That's why she volunteered for operation Brahma She used to say that she will be contributing something great to this... ...world through genetic engineering, if this operation was successful I always supported her I miss her... every day... every minute Ravi Verma is responsible for Shiksha's death Arjun... I will go into that asylum as an inmate -Are you sure Nisha? -Yes No Nisha I will not be able to take it, if something happens to you this time Dad you just told me that mom always... ...wanted to do something for this world We will be saving many lives by exposing this asylum Let this be the purpose of my life And, this is the only chance to avenge mom's death So, this will be our plan We have to stage some scenes and... ...portray Nisha as insane everywhere And when people start thinking, that you are turning insane I will issue a medical certificate that she cannot... ...be left out in public and need medical help That's how we go about the plan Are you mad girl? What the hell is this Nisha... are you crazy? Check if someone's coming You just wait a second I'm going to dial 100 Do it Let the police handle you Look sir... See... Call the police If she is mentally disturbed or having... ...psychological issues, take her to a psychiatrist Prof. Balsubramanyam’s report It says you have schizophrenia What are you seeing... take her Please leave me Shweta... You think you are very intelligent right? It's not me who's fallen in your trap, but it's you who's fallen in my trap Wait... hold on I am very excited to see your arrest news in tomorrow's headlines What the hell are you talking about, you filthy... Spy cam is with you right? Arjun will be here any minute You are so doomed you bastard Arjun is tied up and thrown inside already Hey... Arjun Arjun Check on Nisha Mr. Ravi Verma, enough of this bullshit... come on Nisha Nisha Nisha Nisha Are you okay? Arjun how did you know that he is here... this is a hard place to find Sir, I've installed a GPS tracker in the spycam given to him -Good. -Take Nisha for the medical examination I will see that we get the nearest hearing date possible with the CCMB panel Once I finish all the formalities here, I will see you at the hospital After going through the case details Recognizing Nisha's unique DNA... ...structure, we request CCMB to... ...study her DNA and develop new... ...immune system against diseases Also, our committee wants the government to... ...take over the asylum and prosecute Ravi Verma Everyone of us has desires We win over a few of them and a few of them win over us Every time your desire defeats you, you make a mistake Every time your desire defeats you... ...you battle with millions of neurons It is just your state of mind that turns you into a criminal and you are doomed Every negative emotion like... ...anger, fear, desire, jealousy... ...lust that makes our mind into a weapon... ...exists within us So please be careful Don’t let these come near you If they come close to you... everyone else will distance you So gentlemen, that's the power of the human mind Thanks for being a wonderful audience I hope this lecture was informative enough Thank you so much!
