THE GARDEN OF DELIGHTS Good. Very good. - Perhaps a little more on the lips. - All right. - Excuse me, sir. Where should I put it? - Give it to me. No, not that one! - Which one do you want? - "Recordar", it must be there. Found them! Oh, aren't they corny! You have to comb your eyelids with a pin. - Where should it go, grandpa? - The guest room! I spend 12 hours breathing cement at the factory... so this brat has a future! And this is what I get. No more Mr. Nice Guy for you! If he's capable of doing such a thing at the age of five... What will he do when he's older? Aren't you ashamed? You made your mother cry. Aren't you ashamed? You made your mother cry! Can't you see? You made your mother cry! You're heartless! He'll be bound for the gallows. For the gallows! You've been bad. All right. No more leniency! Until now, you've done everything you please. But you'll start to learn what life's about. He'll sleep with the pigs tonight! Yes! Let the pigs eat his hands! Let's see if that teaches him. To the pig sty! - You were great! - And very convincing. Antonio... you're five years old. There's... a pig in there! Who will eat your little hands! Your little feet! He remembers, he remembers! You'll stay there until tomorrow morning! This is sheer cruelty. We can't be sentimental about it. It hurts me more than it hurts you, but there's no choice. Let's let the subconscious work. The poor child must have had an awful time. Horrible, horrible... fever, nightmares... He saw pigs everywhere. Are we going to wait until the pig eats him? Enough, grandfather. You don't get it. What matters here are the symbols. Nurse! Open up and get him out. - Don Antonio, don Antonio! - You're okay, dad, it was nothing! - Dad! - It's fine, Antonio, there was no pig! It was just a joke. You know there's never been a pig in this house! Don't spoil it! The mother! The mother! Where's the mother? Quick, the pardon. See what happens to bad boys? We'll forgive you this time. To bed now, little Antonio. - Should I do it? - Yes. - Give me a hand. - Just a moment. Good night, don Antonio. Little Antonio? Little Antonio! Wake up! Eleven years old! You'll see. When you get cured, we'll celebrate your birthday. No fever? How did you spend the night? I haven't slept at all, aunt. The medication! There we go. And mom? Sleeping. She spent the whole night watching after you. Don't you want me to look after you? Yes, aunt. When you get better... we'll have long walks together. And I'll take you to watch movies that you aren't allowed to see. Mine! Mine! Mine, mine! Another one, Enrique! Yours, Julia! Hi. Eh? Hi! Dad, please. Where's the nurse? Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! I'd like to know who it was. Nobody should move you around, understand? Was it the gardener? You stay here and learn to write! Pay attention. I'll go through it one more time. This is your signature. Have a good look! Antonio... Cano. You are Antonio Cano. All right? Let's see. Move the fingers in your right hand. Very good. Now start the exercise. First, the "A". No, no, no. You can't use the aid of the left hand. Try to do it all with the right hand. There... Come on, get to work. And don't get distracted. Don Antonio, don't get distracted. Your shake, sir. Here. That's it. Let's not start that. Drink it, or I'm leaving. Don't want. Don't cross me, Don Antonio! You get tedious. - If they find out... - What a fixation! Come on. Drink the shake! Good morning, sir. So? How are you? So you like that? You can leave. Look what I've brought you. The Earth. A wonderful book. Look... a physical... economic and historic map. With many engravings. A history of discoveries; from the wheel until the conquest of space. And an Atlas! Remember how you liked them when you were a child? You'd lock yourself up in a room with a map, and with your imagination... you'd go to the Himalayas, to Alaska... to Japan. Look. Switzerland! Have a look. Swit-zer-land! All this is Switzerland. Let go of that and pay attention to me, please. Look: Swit-zer-land! Understand? And this? Money! Look. Look! Money! Switzerland! Money! Pesetas! Switzerland... money... Switzerland... money... Switzerland... money... Tax evasion... many millions! We need those millions now! It's a desperate situation. Where? Where are those millions? Which bank? Which account? Which account? You didn't tell anyone. Not even to Pachiou, our lawyer in Geneva. You never trusted anyone. Where? Where are the millions? What are we going to do with you, son? Little Antonio, behold the grass and the trees in the field. And you'll find that they yield flowers, leaves and fruits. Plants and trees yield oil, pine and balm... and have a delicate fragrance. And so, the fruit is only as good as the tree which bears it. Because a bad tree cannot yield a good fruit. And so a man, little Antonio, is a tree beaten by the winds... and only by having deep roots can he withstand the gales and storms. And only by resisting winter's harshness... and summer's heat... will the tree stand cool and healthy... and so bear sweet and tasty fruits. However the root, so shall the tree and its fruit be. - How nice! - What fruit can we expect from a tree with a damaged root? A tasteless, bitter fruit, full of worms. But... if the root is healthy and robust... then it shall be a good tree with good fruits! And so in our deeds. Their goodness and perfection... are based on the purity of intention, which is the root. Antonio, this is the day of your First Communion. April 14, 1931. The happiest day of your life! You were so thrilled... And when you were about to receive Confirmation... that swine organist... That swine and some outlaws desecrated the temple! Listen! Listen! Long live the Republic! Liberty! Liberty! Long live Jesus' Sacred Heart! The hymn! The hymn! Christ rules. Christ will rule. S... aints... the S... aints. The Saints. The Saints! The Saints! Silence! Silence! Be quiet! Be quiet! The Saints, aunt! Hide the Saints! The Saints! Yes, son. The Republic's been declared. Remember? 1931. Leiva, Barcelona, San Sebastian. No, no... the reds! The... war! Aunt! The reds! 1936! Aviation! Hi, dad. Good morning. How are you feeling today? Let's see. Put your right hand on your mouth. Come on. Right hand on your mouth! Come on! No, don't help with your left hand. You have to do it with the right hand only. That's it. That's it! Very good. Very good! You're making good progress. Soon, you'll be fine. You'll see. Right. I have to go. Bye, dad. And keep practicing. As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to you. I'm worried, Antonio. We have to make a decision before it's too late. Julia leaves by morning and doesn't show up till night. And that's whenever she feels like it. She's returned at dawn several times. Some days ago I demanded an explanation. Do you know her answer? She told me to leave her alone, it was none of my business. To say that to me... her mother! The other one doesn't even speak to me. Doesn't say a word. You ask him anything; he just smiles and doesn't answer. I told him he could stay in his room with that attitude. And indeed... from that moment, he just stays in his room the whole day. I tried to reason with him. I asked him for an explanation. If he had any problems, if he was sick... Nothing! Not even a syllable. Your father lost his patience and slapped him. He had it coming... by the way. Your son... he didn't bat an eyelid. But he finally spoke, after many days of silence. And what he said was... "You can burn me, but understand that you're not lighting a bonfire. "You're lighting a labyrinth of fire. " What do you think of such a cheeky boy? Are you done with your exercises? Is there anything you want? You know who I am, right? I'm Luchi, your wife. Lu-chi. Let's see if we're in luck. Come. Come. Look. See? This... is... a... safe-ty box. Understand? The combination, Antonio! You must remember. Make an effort, please. Do it for me. I'm your wife. Try to remember. Try... to remember. Lea-ve... Leave... Lea-ve... Leave... Leave, where? Which... is... the... exit. What's wrong? Come in. Go on, come in. Close the door. That's it. Now, sit here. Lea-ve... Have you had breakfast? Open your mouth. That's it. And now tell me. Where do you want to go? To the garden? To look for mom? Can't you answer? I want... to leave. Don't talk with your mouth full! Ok, man. Ok. So you want to leave us. That's all we needed. Obviously, you can't stand us. Neither your mother... nor me. Our young master wants... freedom. Very well. But let me tell you this: If it hadn't it been for your mother, I would've dumped you a long time ago. Me! Do you understand? You better leave now! I've completely lost my faith and confidence in you! You don't respect us, you don't study and you don't do anything worthy! Get out of here, you and your shitty books! Get up! And don't you dare answer back! I'm sick and tired of you! Of your defiance! Your laziness! And your contempt. 'Cause you despise us, don't you? Dare say it in my face! Coward! Get out! And remember, I won't give a damn, whatever happens to you. Whether you go to jail, or starve, or go to a hospital or an asylum! An... tonio... An... to... nio. An... tonio. An... tonio. An... tonio. - Antonio! - An... tonio. Antonio. It's me, Nicole. Don't you recognize me? - Nicole? - Nicole, yes. Your Nicole. - How are you feeling? - Nicole, Nicole... I couldn't come any sooner. I tried to call from the hospital, but they kept telling me... you had been taken somewhere, or they hung up. I tried to see you after you were discharged, but they threw me out. I have known nothing from you since the accident... - My head... My head... - Your head? - Yes... - And what about me? Look. Take a look. - Tell them to go away! I don't want them to see their father with that woman! - Keep quiet! At least you were taken to a private clinic. But me, huh! Me... Nobody took care of me! I had to go to a public hospital, just like the homeless! I dare not even see myself naked. I feel so disgusting. My head... Oh God, my head. I know it's not your fault. What could you do? Last night, when your father came, he explained everything to me. Your family. Huh, your family... Now they want me to help cure you. - Idiot! She's going to spoil it all! - They say they'll pay me. We'll see if that's true. I'm overdue two months' rent, medications... Everything. If only you could get well... Wouldn't you like to come back to my place? Do you remember those times? - Enough! This ends right now! - You and your bullshit! - Leave me alone! Nicole... Nicole, Nicole... Nicole. And they say you don't recognize people! Gone, at last. And you, keep quiet! Shut up! Listen, Antonio. You've got to make an effort. Tell them what you used to give me. They'll believe you. Tell them to give me a check, right now! Out! Out! Get out! You whore! Whore! Whore! Get out of this house! To the street with you! Check! The che... ck! The check! Here it is! Do you remember it? It's yours! Your shotgun. Watch this... Bang, bang! Go ahead. This hand, here... and this one, here. That finger... Watch out the bastard doesn't butcher us all! - It's not loaded! - The... the... - The... the shotgun! - No. - The... the hunt! - Right! Hurry up! - Hurry up! - Right, right, hunt! - Give me some. - Here you are. Give it to me. Give it to me, I have to load it. Look here, the shells. The first one... and the second one. There you go. Hold it firmly. There. The other hand... Your finger, just like before. Hold it firmly. - Ready? - Ready! Bird! The safety lock! You can shoot now! The second shot! - More, more. - Right! - More. - His shotgun. Hand it to me. Here. Your hand, the other hand, just like before... and your finger there. There. Come on, shoot. Shoot. Safety lock, again. Now. Come on, next shot! It'll fly away! It'll fly away! Come on, shoot! Right there. Now, come on! - More! - Loaded. - Here, try again. You'll get it now. Come on, shoot! Next shot! Hurry up! Very good, Antonio, very good! - Wooha! - Fetch! - Wooha! Very good! - I did it! - Very good! - Congratulations! - I did it! - Yes, you, you! - Very good, very good! - There you go! Your trophy! Your hunting trophy! - I did it! - Wonderful! - Wonderful! - I... I... - Yes, you, you! Hey! How's everything going? Hey! - Great! Bull?s-eye! Before a month, we'll be partridge-hunting in Toledo! - Great! Have you seen his enthusiasm? - Lucid, completely lucid! - Completely. - I had my doubts at first... Yes, yes, don't worry. Of course I'll consider you. You'll get your order on the due date. My pleasure. sure. You know we're at your service. Yes, of course. Please. You needn't worry at all. I'll give the order personally. My pleasure. Good-bye, good day. Great, man, great! There he is, Gim?nez. Our brand-new engineer. I already congratulated him. I have a surprise for you. Gim?nez, give it to him. - Is this for me? - I want you to go to the USA for 3 months. But it's a study trip, see. No nonsense, right? - Gim?nez, could you leave us alone? - Yes, sir. - Happy? - Dad, we need to have a very serious talk. I'm listening. It's about our firm. We're absolutely behind the times. The factory keeps working at family-level. Handicraft. We haven't updated our tools. Production is same as ever, and we haven't even thought of increasing the firm's turnover. - But things do work, don't they? - Yes, that's true. But how? Routinely. Not taking into account our country?s present changes... let alone the future changes! - Go ahead, son. Say what you're thinking. I'm listening. Don't take this as criticism. Indeed you made the most out the moment. I mean the easy years, etc. But the situation has changed. We must be competitive, dad. We must develop our potential. First, we have to increase our production. And enhance it. Second, we should use our production for ourselves. Youth hits hard! Go on, go on... Why let others benefit at our expense? Why not become a construction company? You don't improvise a construction company, my son. No, dad, you create it! We can create it, go to auctions. Then build on our own. And even sell on our own! See what I mean? I've considered everything. - That will take a lot of money. - I'll get it! Ok son, ok. But anyway, your sabbatical... What? You don't fancy going to the USA? What I want is to sit on that chair! Here comes the cortege! Here comes the cortege! You can already hear the clear call of the bugles! The sword is announcing its vivid reflection! Here comes, gold and iron, the paladins' cortege! Now passing through arches ornated with white Minervas and Marses, Where fame for their triumphs their lengthy trumpets raise, To the solemn glory of the standards! Carried by the robust hands of heroic athletes. The sound of the cavalry weapons, The warhorses champing the bridles, The helmets wounding the ground, And the kettledrummers... - Victory, son! Victory! Dad's come back from the front line! And amidst all this joy... I find the greatest of sorrows! Your mother, Antonio! Your poor mother! What will become of us, son? What will become of us? - Come... come with me. - No, I don't want to! - The... the movie! - Come! Let's see her for the last time! The... movie! The movie! The... movie. What a tragedy, Antonio! What a tragedy! It was on Christmas Day. We were all so happy, and then, all of a sudden, the terrible news! Do you remember? You were twelve. Come, son. Look at the garden. Let's go! Let's go, son! Come and see her for the last time! Get closer. Get closer, son! Get closer! Here she is! Our saint! Your mother, Antonio! Your mother! Julia! Julia! What are we going to do without you! - What will become of us, my son! - N.. no. Mother... no. - Yes! Dead! Mother is dead! - No! She's not mother! No, she just looks like her. So, you've noticed. You understand! You're making progress, my son! You're making progress! Picture 6. In this picture you can see a factory with three chimneys. Antonio, take a good look, because our family started in that factory. Your grandfather, a man of pristine honesty... and most faithful worker, became its General Manager. Picture 7. Your grandfather's virtues were soon rightly rewarded. Don Fernando Carlos made him his associate. A few years later, with great sacrifice, your grandpa and I... managed to be the sole owners of the factory. Our first factory, my son! Can you remember it? How will you ever remember, Antonio, if you are not paying any attention? Pictures 8, 9, 10 and 11... Now, before your eyes, our d?but as building contractors. It was your idea, son. Make an effort, Antonio. Remember. We needed to build. War had destroyed everything. And you seized the opportunity. We obtained the necessary credit... and we built. Pictures 12, 13, 14 and 15... - What's wrong? - Antonio, you can't have forgotten this. - My... foot. We had already built a lot, but you wanted to take a giant step! I was afraid of getting into something so large... The dam, Antonio! Do you see? We built that dam! And then other dams, roads, tourist complexes... You are insufferable! - Hotels, harbors... - I'm sick of you! - Pictures 16, 17 and 18. Picture 19. Antonio, this is the greatest day in your life. You gathered all personnel in a brotherhood lunch, You gave a speech. Do you remember the newspaper comments? Now you'll hear your own voice. ...because I believe workers must realize... they are not anonymous particles in the productive process... or some number in a list of numbers. The worker must be aware... of the meaning, the value and the importance of his effort... - in the productive complex. - I... I... I! That's right, Don Antonio. You, you! Naturally, this demands great attention to the worker's opinion... - Because undoubtedly, besides... - besides... the great satisfaction... a man... may feel... whenever he gives his opinion... over any aspect of his work, there is a practical advantage. Because you have a lot to say. Practical, therefore valid ideas. Ideas. Ideas we must take into account, put into practice and thank for. Therefore, it's my intention to establish a fruitful dialogue... on a regular and institutional basis... Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! - Which tie? - The... green one. - This one? - N... not that one. The green one! Which green one? This one? This one? Or this one? - That one, that one! I... diot! This one is not green. You are the stupid one. - F... fired! Fired! - Can you keep still? - Fired! - Oh, for God's sake! - Get out! I'm so happy to see your old self coming back, my son! What a temper! Wonderful! - Handkerchief. - Here. Dad... - There. - N... not like that! Give it to me. I'll do it. - Here he is. - Antonio, so glad to see you. - Thanks. - How are you? - Back on the team? - Yes. - How are you? - Very well. - Gentlemen, please be seated. - Thank you. - I'm very happy, you know. - Of course. - Is there anything else, sir? - You may leave. Before we start, I want to express, on behalf of the board and myself... how glad we are with your recovery. - Leave that, let's get to the point. Whenever you please, son. We're listening. Gentlemen: today's economic situation is having a negative impact on our company. If we perform a critical analysis of the situation... we can see an increase in production costs... without a corresponding increase in prices. However... However, We haven't witnessed an increase in turnover... th... that... that... that... Come on, son, continue. "That could... " that... could... co... pensate... com... pensate... "that could compensate, through a lesser incidence in our general expenses... the rise of those costs. " Sorry Antonio, but we're not here to listen to the speech you gave last year. - Please, be quiet. - The Association! That is what we want to know! Tell us about the Association! We want to know how far you got in your preliminary conversations! Try to remember, son. The Association. Association. M... my head. Accident. - Right, your unfortunate accident! - This leads nowhere. Well, gentlemen, we can't wait any longer. If we don't act at once, all this will crumble into pieces. The only solution, dear Don Pedro, is to legally incapacitate him. But... but it was my son who built this company. You all owe him what you are today! Come on, Don Pedro, don?t take it that way. Be reasonable. That's true. We all know it and we are very sorry. But sentimentality won't get us anywhere. What we need now is to save the company. Allow us to tell you what we have agreed on. We have already reached a decision, but given the severe situation... and the little time available, believe me, Don Pedro... this is the best for everyone. We would have preferred... Let's go, Antonio. Do you know where we are? - Aran... juez. I was sure you'd remember! Are you happy we came here? What a life! If it hadn't been for the accident... We wouldn't even be here. You and I. Just the two of us. Do you know how long it's been since we went for a walk? Years... centuries. This is not a recrimination! My poor little thing. I know you had to work. Even though, to say the truth, whenever you had a moment to spare... it wasn't precisely me who you spent it with! If you just knew how lonesome I've been. Not that I've lacked anything! That's true. But a woman needs other things, besides money. Years ago, when our children were small, I felt I had company. But now... they've become so selfish they only look after themselves. Everybody says children fill you with joy, and give so much back. Sure. When they need you. At least, you need me now. Because you do need me, Antonio. Let me tell you one thing. Do you understand what I'm saying? It might seem a monstrosity, but it isn't. It isn't. Listen, I don't care if you don't fully recover. On the contrary, I'll be so happy to dedicate myself to you... to be with you at all times! We can be happy in so many ways, Antonio. And I've been so unhappy. Never, never! You'll never realize how deeply you hurt me! - The... the... - What? The... the.. the... The... - The tree! The fields! The palace! - The... the water! - The water? The river! - Right! - The river. - That's it. The water. All right, calm down. The river. The water. Do you want to swim? The... river. The... ride. The ride... in the river. - You want to take a ride! In a boat, right? - Right! - The boat. - You've remembered, Antonio! How silly of me, I didn't understand. One month before our wedding. You've remembered, my dear God! It was a yellow boat! Right? An... American... tragedy. An American... tragedy. A what? What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't be crazy! Stop it! Do you want to row? You won't make it. They're too heavy! Watch it! Antonio, please! You're messing up my clothes! Antonio, don't! I'm getting all wet! Stop! Come on! Unbelievable! I'm full of dirt! My head. Oh, Goodness, my head. My head. Oh, Goodness, my head. Do what you want with my body, but don't touch my head! Do what you want with my body, but don't touch my head! I've been a child, a girl, a bush, a bird... and a mute fish emerging from the sea. Subtitles: supersoft and scalisto for KG
