RETURN TO LIFE May, 1945. Two million French people ... ... prisoners of war, political deportees ... ... are freed and return to France by air or rail. They have waited a long time for this marvelous moment. But those who left and those who stayed experienced different sorrows. Their hardest task will be to know each other again. To know and understand each other. We are going to tell you five stories of this return to life. The protagonists, who do not know each other, nonetheless have something in common. Their suffering has made them finer and more forgiving. Our theme is the immense good will of those who return and their disappointment at not finding the world of which they dreamed. We are not pessimists. Many returned to faithful hearts. But of them we do not speak -- happiness has no history. This is the return of Emma. - Gaston, your tie's crooked. - I'm very upset. That's no reason not to look nice for the family. It was good of you to come so quickly. Hello, Aunt Berthe. Tell us, how is she? - Come in. Henriette and Charles are here already. -Hello, Henriette. - Hello. - Hello, old man. - Hello. Come on, we're not here for a funeral! This is a happy day, a celebration! - Not so fast! - Why? If you saw her! You don't leave a death camp in good health! We should thank God she's even alive ... Excuse me, don't bring God into this! God let her be deported in the first place! Charles, this is no time for philosophy. Henriette's right, the important thing is that Aunt Emma is back. Tell us, how is she? - It's dreadful! She's a living skeleton ... She had no nutrition! A doctor told me the stomach shrinks -- - Let Aunt Berthe talk! But ... can she walk? They brought her on a stretcher. Leaning on me, she could stand for a few seconds. Well, that's something. - Where was she? - Dachau. Ravensbruck was worse! My boss's sister -- To hell with her! I mean, we pity her with all our heart, but we're talking about Aunt Emma. What did she tell you? - Nothing! I asked a thousand questions, but she didn't answer. She just nodded or shook her head. - Is she in pain? - How can we tell? She says nothing. Maybe her tongue's paralyzed. She asked where the dog was. And us? Didn't she ask about us? She was so exhausted. I put her right to bed. - Didn't she eat? - A biscuit -- in tiny little bites. It took her ten minutes -- maybe a quarter of an hour. She had two sips of mineral water. You wouldn't believe me! I said the stomach -- We believed you! And when you told her her dog was dead -- did she react? No! We don't even know if she hears us. - Maybe she's deaf! - No -- -- sometimes she's with us, sometimes she's gone. Emma was heavier than I, but I can carry her easily. Her knees are like little peas ... -- little nails sticking up against her nightgown! - Did she sleep last night? - It's hard to tell -- She doesn't move. Her eyes are always closed. - Why? - I don't know. Around four in the morning, she rang. She was uncomfortable in the bed. It was too soft. I put the mattress on the floor. I warn you ... I warn you ... It's terrible to see her lying there, on the floor dead white, her eyes closed! And ... that business matter ... ... did you ... mention it? Oh, Gaston, it was impossible! Just a moment! I spoke with the notary ... ... to help us, he committed a serious professional misdemeanor! He insists that we make things legal, urgently! Fine! But she's just back from Dachau on a stretcher, let's say "hello" before bringing up the notary! Fine. We embrace her ... ... then we address the matter. If you saw her condition ... Wait! I'm not the one who'll talk to her! I've been made to understand, often enough, that I'm not one of the family! Who said you weren't one of the family? When? How? Nuances! But I happen to be very sensitive to nuances. For instance: when Henriette mentioned Aunt Emma to friends, she said, "My aunt, who is in Dachau" -- not "our aunt"! But no! Emma was your family, not mine. Well, now you can explain to your aunt ... - Monstrous! You accuse me -- - Don't even answer his nonsense! - Thank you. - Let's not forget your shady cousin! Right up to Dunkirk he expressed certain views. And driving a car -- how did he get the gas and Ausweis? I'm not responsible for my cousin! Our cousin, if you don't mind. Oh, come, none of us behaved badly during the Occupation. Nobody profiteered. Why are we quarreling now? No reason. Charles on his high horse, as usual. I want the situation explained to Aunt Emma! Better her real nephew or niece do it ... Fine, I'll do it! Aunt Berthe, do you think ... would it be inhumane to do it now? You decide. I'll do it. Henriette? You were her favorite. - I don't understand notary business -- - Fine! Everyone's backing out! When we were divvying up, you were all there! You almost came to blows over the cookware! Ours was stolen when we left for Bordeaux! - You got compensation vouchers! - What good were they? We had three children, you, only two! Two children have to eat too! Your selfishness is incredible! And your greed! The flight to Bordeaux -- The brushes, the washtub, even the lawnmower -- you got it all! Real war victims I respect -- but fakes -- ! Simone, Henriette, please! Aunt Emma is next door! After all she's been through -- -- if she heard you bickering over a lawnmower! Gaston's right -- we all have our faults! But we're a family and we love each other. Come, Henriette, kiss Simone. Simone, kiss Henriette. There we are. Now, I'll go in. I'll go in ... or should I wait until tomorrow? Oh, no, after discussing it for an hour! And remember your own words -- "Aunt Emma has a good heart -- I'll be responsible!" I said that? - You, pontificating as usual! - I, pontificating? You said, "Aunt Emma is like our mother! She'll understand!" May I drop dead if I'm lying! But, of course, I would be lying! Go ahead, say I'm lying! - No! You were right to remind me. It's true, Aunt Emma is a good woman who's always loved us. I'm not afraid any more. I'm going in. - No answer. - She doesn't speak. I'll handle this. Aunt Emma ... It's Gaston. Do you recognize my voice? You used to call me Tontinet. You recognized me! I'm thinner, of course. Food was hard to come by ... That is ... Simone and the children prayed for you every day. Me too, of course. Never mind what Charles used to say ... I don't want to tire you, but I want you to know we're going to give you such love and care that you'll be back on your feet soon. We come of solid stock! Remember your father, cutting his own firewood at 93? And your mother dancing at Cl√©mentine's wedding -- in her eighties! Oh, we're a sturdy bunch! Of course, there's a limit to everything ... As a matter of fact, I wanted to tell you ... Uncle Arthur ... he died. Two months after your arrest. Just like that. No wife, no children ... a good death. And a good legacy. A good, fair will. No favoritism, a fair share each. Yours is safe with the notary, untouched. As for the furniture, it was shared just as though you had been there. There was one little problem. For the inheritance, the notary insisted on your signature. But where were you? Who knew! We had no official documentation of your arrest. Just putting your share aside wasn't enough. To release our shares, the notary had to have your signature. Aunt Emma, you understand ... life was getting more and more expensive. 600 francs for a pound of butter! A tiny little roast -- 400 francs! Vermouth was 18 francs a thimbleful at my bistro! You'll say one can live without vermouth, or butter, or a roast. But what about the children? You would have been the first to pity their poor little faces and skinny legs! Aunt Emma, do you hear me? Are you thirsty? Shall I fix your blanket? It would be cowardly to put it all on the children. We went on living, too -- living as best we could. The money was a temptation. We didn't know what would happen. Planes came over almost every night. The women were still women, wanting a new hat -- and the men were still men, too. We couldn't keep telling ourselves that others, like you, were suffering in hell. So, Aunt Emma, to get the legacy I forged your signature. Did I do wrong? Thank you. You're so good. So understanding. I knew you would be. The notary is shaking in his shoes and Charles sees himself in prison already. So, I'm sorry, but ... I must ask one more thing of you. All the papers are in Aunt Berthe's desk. To put everything in order ... ... could you sign them right now? Thank you. Don't move. I'll be right back. Well? She agrees. Agreeing isn't enough -- mere words! She must sign. She'll sign. Aunt Berthe, would you give me the papers? She didn't ask to see us? - No, she didn't say a word. - Are you sure she understood? She understood. I don't care about business, I just want to see her and kiss her. Well, go in for a minute. Why Henriette and not me? All right, you too, just don't tire her out. I must see Aunt Emma sign with my own eyes. Why? Are you afraid I'll sign myself a second time? No, but I want things done correctly. Bring the pen and inkwell. The children asked me to tell you things ... so many things. Ours too ... they'll come as soon as you're well enough. My father was in the Resistance, he ran great risks. Once a man, definitely Gestapo, questioned our concierge ... Simone! Hardly the time. You always imply Papa did nothing. I don't, but leave Aunt Emma alone now. It's me again ... Tontinet. With the papers. To sign them ... you've got to sit up. Can you do it by yourself? Well ... Henriette and Simone will help you. Each of you take a shoulder. Gently. Both together ... there. Does that hurt? On the first two pages, just put your initials next to ours. Sign at the bottom of the third. -Charles, the pen. - You must read the will to Aunt Emma! - Why? - That's how it's done! - Charles, do you want a smack? What graciousness! I concur ... ... if Aunt Emma attests that she trusts us. You hear Charles' objection? You agree to everything? Pass the pen. Initials here. Want me to support your arm? There. Now here. There. Sign here. Courage, it's all over. Lay her back down gently. We didn't tire you too much? Leave her alone. We'll see you tomorrow -- you'll be better then already. And by the end of the month -- Let her rest, Henriette, she deserves it. Forgive me. The light seems to bother her. She'll rest easier in the dark. Berthe ... Did you call me? You didn't tell me how the dog died. It's very simple ... When the Germans took you away ... Follette refused to eat. Not even sugar. I gave her rice, milk ... everything she liked. She cried for five days ... then she died. Is there anything you need? Shall I draw the curtain? The return of Antoine. She's gone, you can come out. If our barracks were like this, we'd take a seven-year stretch! - They've got the whole hotel? - Requisitioned. What'll you have? - White wine? - I always have a litre handy. Nothing but women -- WACs. - Nice? - All discipline and regulations. We've been up against the brass for a thousand years. For them it's brand new and they take it seriously. - Cheers, Antoine! To your return! - To you, F√©lix. Paris must seem different after four years. Not really -- 24 hours and I was set. I left no one behind -- no wife, no more parents. Makes coming back easier. What I need is a job, and quickly. Of course. There's no shortage of bars. We've nothing to drink, but they keep opening them! - Think you could find me something? - Listen ... You're a POW and my pal. We'll fix it up -- I'll work days, you nights. Nights -- the WACs drink? No, the bar's closed. But if it were open, all the better! - Lieutenant? - I'm a captain. - Captain. - Don't you speak American? Just the basics: gin, whiskey, Coca Cola. The old bartender used to bring a bottle of water to my room every evening. Didn't he tell you? - No. Room 42. - A small Perrier every evening ... - A small Perrier every evening ... And a bottle of whiskey every other day. Thank you. 42... Whiskey, a whole bottle... Hello? Dry martini? Eleven? Got it! 11... Martini. Hello? Slowly, bitte sch√∂n. Cognac? Yes, understood. And some beer? If you like it that way... A spider? A spider on your ceiling? And you're afraid, Lieutenant? I am coming. Whiskey... Martini... Come in. Excuse me. So many different orders, it's impossible to memorize. I brought a whole selection of drinks. May I? I rang but I‚Äôm not thirsty. I‚Äôm hungry. Hungry? If you don‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôve decided to be hungry. Decided? I don't follow. To be good at war, you must refuse all tenderness. So when I‚Äôm feeling blue, I eat, do you understand? I choose my stomach to be the problem, not my heart. Make me an egg with bacon. Your 7 of spades covers your 8 of hearts. Do you know this solitaire? I was POW for 4 years. Only we used to call it ‚Äúpatience‚Äù. I know them all: the French one, the English, the American, the Russian, the Yugoslav. - Are you sure you don‚Äôt want to drink? - I'm sure. Well then, if you excuse me, Captain, the garrison is thirsty. Bartender! Captain? Remind the garrison that it‚Äôs forbidden to let a man in a room after curfew. Yes, Captain. Come in. At last, here you are. Lieutenant... Could you please remind me your order? Dry martini. I just received a new little hat. Do you like it? Yes. We see a lot of that. It‚Äôs very √† la mode. There‚Äôs a way to wear it like that. Charming! But the regs allow a little bit more fantasy. Like that. Even better. - And side-on? - Perfect. A-la Napol√©on would be overkill, I suppose? That could cause you troubles. Last night I was at the cabaret and I saw the French cancan. Do you know it? The French cancan? It's pretty well known. With these little white petticoats and black silk stockings‚Ä¶ It's very exciting! Especially these things, what do you call those... ...the fixed socks for silk stockings? - Fixed socks for silk stockings? - Yes, down there. - The garters? - That's right! With little roses and violets, it's very pretty. Can you tell me where I can buy the floral garters? Lieutenant, I personally don't wear them. But I can find out. It‚Äôs very Parisian. And my husband has a passion for France. One martini! To victory! Hah, Teddy! Just a minute! Come in! Sorry. Come on in. Don't be so scared. What's wrong? I‚Äôm sorry, Lieutenant, I thought you rang. No. I wanted to, but I didn't. - Do you want to seize the occasion? - I‚Äôm not thirsty. Teddy, are you thirsty? No, he's not thirsty. But is it allowed after the curfew to have a male individual in your room and even in your bed? Teddy is not a man. He is, all by himself, all the men in the world. You can't understand. Do you think so? Sorry for the inconvenience. Sleep well, both of you. What a funny army‚Ä¶ Bartender! Bartender. What rank did you have in the French army? Caporal. Well, Caporal, come with me. - But, Lieutenant... - Obey your superior. Come on in. Here we go. Very good. Your Lieutenant is fed up with uniform, with all these boots and belts. With war in general. And tonight, for a moment, the war is over. Come on in. Put your tray here. We are matched. Me, in my evening dress, and you‚Ä¶ One moment. Voil√†! It's better this way. Just wait. Nice! My dear friend, I'm so glad that you walked up to wish me good night. Well, answer me. What should I say? Anything you want. That my dress is exquisite, that I‚Äôm beautiful. - But, Lieutenant‚Ä¶ - My name is Evelyne. Sit there. You are doing very well. - Do I have to sit down? - As long as I say so! That's right. A drink? What can I offer you? I have a nice assortment in my little bar. Martini, whiskey... - I assure you‚Ä¶ - Leave it to me. You don‚Äôt know what a pleasure it is for me to receive you, to serve you and to finally wear the shoes that hurt me. - A drop of water in your whiskey? - I don't want to bother you. You don‚Äôt follow the game. We've been asked to do very hard things for too long. Don't you want to play with me? Evelyne, how many times do I have to tell you that I don't like water in my whiskey? Do you know my aunt Elina? I can't even remember your name. That's not very polite. Antoine. I have some cigarettes here. Take one. - Do you have a light, Antoine? - Sure. What's that thing? It's a French lighter. The best you can find these days, without gas nor matches. The good old cave system. A fire striker and a rod. It's a hard thing to use, but for the ladies we do it on the first try. What a funny thing, with this rope... Our lighters are all the same. It's yours now. Really? Oh, Antoine! You're always so kind! Aren't you afraid to wake up everybody? Nobody sleeps. We're 300 under one roof, all alike. The regulations tell us when to go to bed, but it hasn't the power to make us sleep. Antoine... It's a very hard thing to say... Do you know what I madly desire? I guess I do. Don't get it wrong. I guess I won't. If you guessed it right, it's a real wonder. You have a mad, irresistible desire to go AWOL and dance. Antoine, how did you know? I've had 4 years of suffering. It makes you less stupid and more sensitive. Let's go then? Wait! What if they call for you? Let's say I introduced a dry law. It's good for the liver. What if they punish you and you lose your job? I don't care. It's my return. It's not how I had imagined it... but it's much better. Let's go. Antoine, I adore you. One more reason to go dancing. But we have to make it quiet. Let's go on tiptoe. You go first. Take a look. If the path is clear, let me know. Captain, the fault is mine and mine alone. I want only one thing from you: my omelette. But I can't do everything at once. Follow me to the bar, or you'll vanish again. Captain, if you wish, I can serve you in your room. I prefer here. Do I have your permission to enter the kitchen? I'm curious to see you cooking. Let's go in. - How many eggs do you want? - Only one. So you think you're irresistible? Me? Not at all. I know that nobody even noticed me until midnight. The bartender was part of the furniture. It was only afterwards, when the others left, that you realized that the bartender was a man too. I'm sort of a catalyst for all of you. You're not irresistible, but you're very kind. Thank you. But I can't find the butter or the eggs. And I don't even have a frying pan. To be honest, it's the first time I enter this kitchen. Me too. But I bet that you'll find eggs here, butter - there... As for the frying pan, it's looking right at you. How do you do it? Kitchen is the real battlefield of a woman. Sit down and leave it to me. No, no, it's my job! Do as I tell you without discussion. Are you hungry? Me? No. Say that you are. - Why? - Just for me. When me and Harry used to come home after the movies, he was often hungry. He used to tell me: "Betty, two eggs!" It bothered me, but I did it anyway. I didn't know how wonderful is it to cook for someone you love. Betty, would you make two eggs for me, please? Make sure that they're not broken, like the other time. I'll try my best, darling. Tonight's movie was really dumb. Do you agree? Absolutely. Only this young girl was quite charming. And she had pretty legs too. But the prettiest legs in the world are yours, Capt... Oh, I'm sorry. ...are yours, my darling. Don't have a light? No. I've lost my lighter. May I help you? Thank you, Lieutenant. You left your tray in my room. I'd wish that you came up to take it before I got back. Well, Betty, will I wait for these eggs till tomorrow? No more eggs and no more Betty. Bartender, call me Captain. And please keep in mind: if I ring because I'm hungry or thirsty or in need of anything at all, I forbid you to came up to my room. Let me ring and don't answer until I give up. At your orders, Captain. Good night, catalyst. One last word. You just got back from captivity, and I don't want you to lose your job. But from now on you'll be the day bartender and let the old man work at nights. It makes you wonder why WACs need a night bartender. No one ever rings. The return of Jean. - Give me 50 grams of bread. - Yes, Miss. Oh, sit still, you wretched child! Bad baby! Gaston, please, don't make it worse! When will we be home again? No news about your return? Put off again. We're living out of suitcases. With all this red tape, one can't be in a hurry! But I am! I've got a waiting list for your room! Ah, Mlle. Platin, was it a good dinner? - It was small. - You'll sleep all the better. Well, Commander! How's the appetite? Better than the rations. Skimpy stuff. Don't complain, or you'll get no dessert. Have you a light, Doctor? Mr. Girard's health isn't worse, is it? No worse than usual. But now he's decided to eat after everyone else. He's getting on my nerves! At the Oflag he ate with the others. A fellow prisoner is sacred, but if I have to serve a separate meal -- Don't whine, here he is. - It's a pain. - Have a heart. I have! Without me, where would you all live? I could rent my rooms now in a flash, for far more. By the hour or by the day? We might have hot water then. Everyone else has eaten. I'm not hungry. - May I? - I said I wasn't hungry. I am! I've seen three wars, dear sir: 1873, 1914, and this one. I never lost my appetite. My morale is unshakable! Like the Mar√©chal! - Give me a bit of cheese. - Come on, you must eat. The doctor's right -- returnees must build themselves up -- -- to rebuild France! France got along without me for five years. With that attitude, no wonder we lost the war! Forget her! Look what I just got -- A regimental reunion -- all the boys will be there. I spent enough time with them. ... Hitler, with Eva Braun and Martin Bormann ... ... has escaped from Berlin by helicopter ... ... to a Dutch stronghold prepared for them in advance. The war -- What's the matter with you? The war may not interest you, but why deprive the rest of us? Returnees, watch your diet! - You make me tired, you and your war! Doctors suggest avoiding fats, spices, sauces ... ... and any dish that might cause indigestion. Returnees, reclassification centers are eager to assist you ... ... to find a job. - Please, just eat. - I'm sick of this! Sick of the radio! Sick of you all! - It's time for your injection. Good! I'm glad! It will be a change from your mugs -- and mine! I'll wait for you upstairs. ... bring a rent receipt, health certificate, proof of residence ... ... military record, and attestation by your employer as of June 16, 1939. The attestation must be notarized by the official ... Are you feeling bad, Mr. Girard? Those idiots spoiled what appetite I had left, that's all. How about some hot chocolate? Just a cup before you sleep? I'm making some for myself -- why not for two? Pardon me, here's the doctor. I'll bring the chocolate to your room after you've had your injection! Don't bother -- I take advantage of the dope to get to sleep. You're terrible! Isn't he, doctor? Was he like this in the camp -- did he want nothing? Oh, yes -- to eat meat and make love. In short, you're a man like any other. I was wounded in the leg -- not elsewhere. You should have an interest in life! - I'll be ready in two minutes. - I'll leave you to it. - Makes no difference to me. - I'll be back soon. You'll have my chocolate, like it or not! Don't you want her chocolate? It's hot! You have some. - I wouldn't say no -- she's not bad! - Says you. I'm done with women -- like everything else. You're not impotent. Impotent, yes -- to everything. Impotent to live, to work ... But ... ... idleness is terrible. I ache from doing nothing. My one pleasure is trying to understand. They've given me a spectator's soul, and I'm a bad audience. - Good thing you don't teach kids that. - That's why I resigned. When I know what to tell them, I'll go back. Let's see that leg. German doctors aren't bad. - Neither are German sentries. - Shouldn't have tried to escape. Look what you've ended up doing. You could meditate just as well back there in the jug. I like prisons only when the key is on the inside of the door. You must move around -- if you don't, just look at your leg in six months. Look at me, with this pathetic excuse for a clinic. I still manage to get something done. Good for you. Starting up again. Shooting at someone. Yes ... sounds like it. Of course. On with the dance. Hear that? From up there. Don't be frightened -- I'm here. - Is this a raid? - No. - Who are they shooting at? - Go home, you'll find out. Light ... curtains ... - Was it you they were shooting at? - Us. - More than one? - Two. Escaped prisoners. Wounded? ... The bastards. Hang on. Don't be afraid. I'll be right back. Right back! Open up, it's me. Hurry up! - Something wrong? What? Sorry. Come quick, I need you. - Are you ill? - Go, he needs you. There's a wounded man in my room. A German escapee. The police are after him. You're the forgiving type! What are you waiting for? Keep moving! No, no ... friends. Friends, friends ... you're quick to say that. Bad? The bullet's near the heart. Nothing I can do here, by myself. Get him to the hospital. No hospital ... No hospital ... prison! Don't want ... - But we can't tend you here! - Don't care ... Keep me here ... an hour. Just an hour ... Then I'll go. - Feet first! I can't accept that responsibility. - You must. Have mercy. - Give me a hand -- let's lay him down. - In your bed? - Thank you ... - Oh, shut up. Strange he doesn't want care. They're both in the building. One must be armed. Thanks, Inspector. Send men, no warrant needed. But we'll catch them before you get here. Go! - Here they come. - Nice mess we're in ... What now? Tend to me. I'm sick, tend to me! - Just a storeroom. - Got the key? He must be asleep already. Come in. - Been in this room long? - 45 minutes. My friend Girard's sick. - See anything unusual? - No. - Hear anything? - No. Oh, well. Sorry to have disturbed you. You made it. That was close. All for a guy we would have shot a year ago without a second thought. Or who would have shot us. He should have morphine, at least. Go get it. What a night. - Not too frightened? - Yes, very. I thought you would tell. - Not a chance. I, too, was a prisoner ... hunted ... I, too, had the police on my trail. I lay hidden in the snow, near K√∂nigsberg.. Do you know K√∂nigsberg? - No, M√ºnchen. Are you in such a hurry to get back there? -My wife, my children need me. - Are you married? - Not me! Life being what it is ... why inflict it on others? You speak good French. - I was a language teacher. You too? - Oh, this is fine. - What's wrong? Are they coming back? No, but they told me a few things. Do you know who this man is? - A pawn, like me. A loser. Think so? He's a bastard, sentenced to death. Like his comrade. - Yes? Why? - Ask him. Speak up. - For doing my duty. - Your duty, you swine! He tortured with his own hands I don't know how many men. Men, women, anyone! - Is this true? Speak! - You wouldn't understand. - Who cares! Go get the cops. - Why didn't you? - For your sake -- he's your guest. - We've got time. - I'm going. Escaped prisoner, yes -- torturer, no! - Give him his morphine first, then go. Think he doesn't deserve to suffer? - That's not the point. I want him to have the strength to talk. You can't talk in pain. - Ask him his opinion on that. - Please, give him the morphine. - Why talk with scum like that? - Aren't you curious? Here's a man like us ... He has a head ... eyes ... ... a body like ours ... ... a wife ... ... children, whose cheeks he patted when he was home on leave ... ... and this man, for four years, tortured people. Every day, like going to the office ... ... he stuck into living flesh things that cut, that burn ... Don't you want to understand? - No, I don't care. I don't want to think about it. - You're afraid to know? Not me. Give him the shot. Soon they'll be sending in tanks. Careful, don't kill him. Suppose he has a weak heart? - It would take four times as much. I must know, do you understand? In the POW camp, it was simple. When we got into a fight, we shook hands afterwards. Right? But when I came home, I learned all the rest. Deportations, camps, firing squads, torture ... My head started spinning. It's a vertigo I can't escape. It haunts my nights. How can I be calm when it doesn't stop? For what they invented -- reinvented -- drew from the dark -- it doesn't stop! It's never stopped! - It's not the same thing. But now the habit is formed. As I speak, somewhere in the world one man screams under another's whip. Lives are broken in torment. And that is crazy. It's unthinkable. For me, anyway. If there's an explanation, I want it. He's the only one who can give it to me. - Then you'll call the cops? - Perhaps, I don't know. Probably. But no one asked you to judge! The decision's been made by real judges. This fellow is their concern. If you only knew how little other people's justice means to me! Listen to it tramping. - That's not justice, it's the police. Justice treads just as heavily. Ah, dear colleague! Feeling better? You can speak now? You heard -- explain yourself! Is that all? You must! - Leave him be. - Give him some water. Careful -- one's on the roof. - You're not going up yourself? - There's only a skylight -- he's armed. Arm! Forward! Close your windows, up there! Good. Now let's get to it. During your sessions, when blood flowed, when eyes rolled back -- did you enjoy it? No. It was horrible. At first, I would vomit. - But you got used to it. You learned to handle the bullwhip and the hot iron cleanly and correctly. You weren't thinking then about your kids, of course. You were thinking about something else. What? - No. I suffered with them. - Naturally. When it was over, you washed your hands and ran to the brothel. Admit it! - So as not to see, not to hear. - Untrue! Look at him. Know why he's lucky? Because he hid with an idiot like you! Searchlights now! - Explain to him, Bernard -- -- his greatest stroke of luck was the war! Without it, he would have spent his life between classroom and hearth -- -- dreaming every night of cutting a woman in pieces. But the war came, with all its refinements -- -- and he fulfilled his potential! He was able to work with real flesh and blood! You're wrong. I'm no sadist. I hardened myself because I had to. But the first time, I was sick. Very sick. - How unfortunate. But later -- - One gets used to anything. -- are you sure you didn't enjoy it? Do you swear to that? I swear it. So much the worse for you. He has no excuse. - Were you looking for an excuse? If it turned him on, would you give him your blessing? Madmen go to the asylum, not the firing squad. But he's no madman. He accepts responsibility -- don't you? - I do. - Well then! The only excuse for cruelty, sir, is effectiveness. Brutality is meaningless. You can't make a man talk by slapping him. If you beat him and he still doesn't talk -- -- if you stop then, all the blows you've struck -- -- all the pain he's felt -- -- are useless. Are evil. So you must go on -- keep going on -- -- for the thing to be justified. It's shameful to be a torturer. But it's unthinkable -- as you say -- -- to be a torturer to no result. You didn't always succeed -- some died without talking. Yes. It was dreadful. - But you began again the next day! - That very night. It was my duty. I had to erase my failure or blow my brains out. - That might have been the thing to do. - A faithful soldier hasn't that right. We had to win the war. - You lost it. I still had to be faithful to what I had chosen to believe. A tall ladder. Try to understand, since you asked me to talk. I was twenty when the last war ended. I spent my youth among chaos. Germany was like a trampled anthill. I was alone. Dreadfully alone. One day, the German people came together again. I gave myself up wholeheartedly. I was lost as one is lost in love. When war came, I didn't draw back. And you chose the foulest task! Deliberately. Because someone had to. And I felt I was capable of it. You would have done the same. - Never! You hear me? Never! You think you're right, because you reason well. But you're wrong. If you reasoned a million times better, you'd still be wrong. Because it's all false! You don't hang a woman by her thumbs -- -- you don't slice up a man's flesh -- unless you're a monster! I could vomit. You talk of patriotism. What kind of country organizes schools for torture? Camps with men crawling on all fours? Tied in kennels? Howling like animals? Until they forgot they were human. That is unforgivable! Because beyond countries, beyond religion, is mankind. The human person ... Respect for man ... Trust between men ... All this you crushed and spattered with blood! Because of what you did, we are ashamed to be men. When can we forget it? Regain a little hope? When will we be healed? Answer me, you scum! I'm in too much pain. If you were a priest, you would let me die. I'm not a priest. Since I have the right to judge you, I also have the duty to do so. My judgement is that you go die elsewhere. You've removed yourself from humanity! Stay there! I feel fellowship with all men -- not monsters! Get him out of here! Get up! Get up! The hell you can't. That's us, the strong men, the masters! For God's sake, die! Look at him! Doesn't that make you feel better! Get a load of the Ubermensch! Head up! Forward march! Forward! - He can't, Girard. Too bad! Forward! Your victims couldn't either. Here's for those who went on their knees! Oh, the filth ... Even I ... It's contagious. I struck a wounded man ... who was asking for asylum ... That'll teach you to deal justice yourself. Justice! To think we'll have to hand him over. They'll heal him so they can shoot him. They won't heal him. In a few hours it'll all be over. - Do you swear it? - He'll last till dawn, that's all. Then get the cops. It doesn't matter now. Go! It'll be on my head. No, Madame, I don't know what's happening. And I wouldn't say. God, if you exist ... ... forgive him, and forgive me. - Where is he? - There. Take him and do as you will. - He's dead. - Yes. This is the return of Ren√©. We've waited long enough! A little patience, you'll be fine. Well, we can begin. Sir, people from Le Figaro are late. No time to wait, the government official is already here. - Where is he? - Right there. No, no, don't disturb him. ...to find yourself back in our dear, sweet France... Sir, are you ready? - I'm waiting for you. - Perfect. - Brugnon! - Yes, sir! Hurry up! We start right away. - Where we're at? - 495. 495? Let me see. 496, 497, 498... Martin Ren√©! Bring me this Martin Ren√© at once! Yes, sir! Martin Ren√©! Do you know any Martin Ren√©? He must be in the shower. Take off your clothes. Next! Next! - Thank you, Lieutenant. - You're welcome, my dear. Not too hot, not too cold? A perfect fit, Lieutenant. You must be honest, you know. Thank you, sir. He's so gentle, it's even weird. Martin Ren√©! Is there any Martin Ren√© here? Do you know him? Where is he? Martin! Ren√©! It's you they're looking for! - Are you Martin Ren√©? - Yes, sir. Are you deaf or what? Why don't you answer? Everytime they call for a POW, it's a bad omen. So I'd better wait till it's over. It's over now. This time it's a decoration omen. For what? I didn't do anything. You're the 1,500,000th. The 1,500,000th POW who's coming back. So what? We found him. Now we're ready. Are you in a rush? I must preside at my purging committee at 11 am. Who do you judge? Today it's some cleaning women who worked at the German HQ. They were well paid! The other day, I think, they purged Mme Granval? She was acquitted. No! No kidding! I know her. She was one hell of a collaborator! It turns out that she was in the Resistance. Here is Martin Ren√©, sir! Come closer, my friend. Sir, this is our man. Martin Ren√©. Hello, my friend. I give you all my congratulations. No reason, really. Please, don't. I congratulate you for having humbly borne 5 years of the cruel discipline of captivity. For having payed for your country's defeat without even looking for salvational escape. 5 years of suffering in the flesh... Because you were wounded? - I'm sorry? - I was, while trying to escape. Having learned from mistakes of the previous war, we will rebuild together a laboring, just and fraternal France. It is for me, a modest delegate of the provisional government, member of the Supreme Council of the Republic, attach√© to the Minister of War, honorary president of this reception committee... It is for me, I say, an immense joy to reach out my hands to you. You are a stranger to us, certainly. That's even more symbolic. And your name is Martin. It's like having no name at all. You are the typical stranger, the anonymous par excellence, but... ...not for France! You're not a stranger for her. You are the 1,500,000th son she had missed. Damn, we skipped a name. It's another guy who's the 1,500,000th. Should we restart? I have no more time. Albert Lamotte is the 1,500,000th. Lamotte? Good for him. It doesn't matter much, let's proceed. - It's ridiculous. - Keep the ball rolling. So accept all of France, because she holds out her hands with mine. That's for Lamotte that she holds them out. Dear 1,500,000th, accept, as a gift from your homeland, this work of art, token of her solemnity and her joy. Fate has made you its owner, so be worthy of it! And smile for pictures. So you say you were wounded while trying to escape? Come in. M. Martin, please. M. Martin is not here, he's in captivity. Liar! Holy cow! How do you do? Are you wounded? Just a little relic from the Krauts. But it's from Krauts anyway. You look fine, you haven't changed. - How is M. Lafit? - He's all right. - He has aged too. - "Too"? He just left for his purging committee. - Have you been up at your place? - I was going to. - Come in! - I don't want to disturb. What is this thing you're holding? "Moved and Compassionate France". Pretty. Is it bronze? Just imitation. What are you doing? Have a seat. I'm sorting ration cards for the bakery. The real ones on one side, the fake ones on the other. - These are real? - These are fake. - They forge a lot? - They haven't much choice, you know. In the first 2 weeks you rarely see a fake one. - And in the last 2 weeks... - ...you rarely see a real one. How is it going up there? Is Linotte all right? Yes, she's fine. Didn't she write to you? She's so forgetful! I hadn't any news from her since... Was somebody killed? Please, have a seat. Bad news? No, but you'd better sit down. What's going on? You just reminded me. You used to call Linotte "daydreamer" for a reason. She could forget to buy bread, forget her bag or umbrella... I get it: she forgot me. You have gone too far for too long. She left 3 months ago. - With another man? - Obviously. On the other hand, he's a decent guy. He's not some collaborationist, that's for sure. She left with a good Frenchman. He was even in the real Resistance! Not much of a consolation, I know, but it's still preferable. To be honest, for the moment it brings me nothing. Arletty, there are sausages at the mercer's! Thanks, I'm coming. But it's Monsieur Martin! Now are you, dear sir? Did you come back? You must be happy! Yes, I'm very happy. - That's the only thing that matters. - For sure. - Well, enjoy! - Goodbye. Do you know that there's butter at the cobbler? It's too expensive, considering that we pay with cigarettes. We have to help each other. But you look sad. I don't feel any joy. - What about my dogs? - They're fine. They'll tell you all up there. Up there? Is there anyone in my apartment? The refugees. I couldn't give up on the victim of Le Havre with 3 kids. - Any more good news? - No more. - And my stuff, my collections? - All taken care of. Are they up there, these people? I didn't see them leaving. I'll go and talk with them. See you later. This damn thing! You must have found France rather peculiar. But with cheerful mind you'll get used to it. Many difficulties, especially for housing. Where do you plan to settle? But for how long do you plan to settle at my place? I can't leave until I find another apartment. You won't kick out a victim of Le Havre, a resistant wire-to-wire! You were in the Resistance? I was even wounded at Wagram. At Wagram? We stormed the Wagram metro station one hour earlier than the Leclerc's division. Well done! I know that the Resistance was very helpful. Oh my God! Marie, calm down the kids! Quiet, kids! I can hear you! Or I'll get you! Now they're nice. Please, serve yourself. My great-grandmother's service! - Very pretty. - And intact! The other day I dropped it, but you're lucky: it fell on the carpet and didn't broke! Very lucky indeed. But do you still have my porcelain collection? No. Madame Luguette sold it. She sold my porcelain collection? What about my precious books? Your books are here, don't worry. - My "Don Quichotte" too? - Everything! I must have left here some clothes, some shoes... You see, I've nothing to wear. No. Madame Luguette gave it all to this young man who... She gave him my...? What a bitch... Have a drink, it will cheer you up. To your return! Damn kids! What is the matter with you? What's going on? Close the door. I told you not to touch it! Minotte, aren't you ashamed? Watch over your kids! "Don Quichotte"! Let's go. Give me this. You tore the page! You too, come here! Let's go, quickly! I don't want to hear you! I'm very angry. Come on. - Hello, sir! - Hello, sir. - Good day, sir. - Good day, young lady. You've got a boo boo? Yes, I've got a boo boo. - You have charming kids. - They're quite diabolic. He bumped his head! You should see the other guy. It's nothing. And where are my dogs? They're at your uncle's. But we still have your posters. Bring his posters! I'm just looking for them. - Am I a nuisance, mam? - Not at all. Where are you planning to stay? Don't know yet. You should take the maid's room for a start. Good idea! - Here are your posters. - Thank you. And also some clothes. Clothes? I had them hidden. An almost new gray suit, some underwear... I don't know how to thank you. Give me the keys, it's upstairs. There are no clothes upstairs! In the boxes, under the big old lamp. - My table-lamp! - Oh, the broken one... I'll go get it. Excuse me, I have to go for a meeting. - Will you be back for dinner? - Yes. Try to find some meat. There are sausages at the mercer's. You don't waste your time! He's a hell of a hustler! - He'll be fine! - Where are you going? As usual, at my purging committee. That one too... Ren√© Martin and his smart canines Zuma, please, 2+2 ? Thank you, miss. What a big dog! It's not mean? Here you are... What is he doing? Addition? Yes, and he does it right. So it's a pack of nerds. You're a sharp one. - Some candy? - Thank you. Thank you, sir. What do you say when they give you a candy? Give me one more! Sly as a fox! - Have you seen our big phono? - Yes. - It makes music. - What a marvel! - Don't bother him. - I'm all right, mam. Jeez... My favorite tune. Sounds a bit girlish. I haven't heard it for 5 years. Well, that's it. What about the room? Is it settled? Come back tonight, all will be ready. It's the least I can do. - My God, I agree. - And rightly so. I'll even ask you for the keys right away: I can't wait to put on my old new suit. Here they are. - Make yourself at home. - Thank you. - Who wants to help? - Me! Me! Me! You don't have to, I'll manage. Not too heavy? - I'm a soldier! - Yes, you are. And I take my rifle. - And "The Grateful France". - And the boxes. Thank you for your kindness. And a little bit of dust. Sorry for having broke a few trinkets. I'm too spineless with my kids. Don't complain, your kids are wonderful. They're spoiled. A real soldier! Try to spend a whole day with them! They're being stupid again! See you later! Don't judge too fast. So what if your wife deserted? We have a reason to spoil them. Your wife too had a reason. Oh yes. If your wives were in captivity, you would have cheated on them in no time. So... Is it yours? Yes. - You were in the Resistance? - Yes. You haven't told me. I didn't do it just to tell you. Let's go see your dogs. If they don't recognize me, I will have nothing left. - Thank you very much. - Sorry, uncle. Wait... Walk alone in front of the kennel and watch them. - What are you up to? - You'll see. What's up? Are you sad? I told you, idiot, life still has its ups. Hello, kids, hello. Hi, Kiki. Hi, Premier. Are you happy to see your old master? Yes, mam! You still remember your old master! Hello, hello! Your old master was thinking about you too. He didn't dump you, he went to fight for rights and freedom. You don't care, do you? Another piece of news: we have no mistress and no flat. You don't care about that too? Me neither. Let's talk about things that matter. Be careful with your old master! Your old master is broke as a joke. That means we have to work. Let's see what you still can do. Pantalon, you go first. Come on, wise guy, let's walk on hind legs. Yes, we love each other and we're happy. There's a lot of love, but there must be a bit of walking too. Start with the left leg. Pantalon! That's a bad start. Thelma, your turn. Come here. Let's do something easy. A somersault! Go, Thelma! Somersault, my darling! Don't you remember? You didn't make them work? I combed them, washed them, cared for them. - But as for the training... - I see. Albert, now you go. You, the smartest, the hard worker. You're going to reassure your old master. Show me a flea jump. A flea jump, my love. They know nothing anymore. It will come back. Yes, but when? I meet my friends at 6. Maybe something will come over. - You know... - What? I guess your friends aren't coming. Let's go. - Excuse me, aren't you Ren√© Martin? - I am. I knew by your wound. Your friend Poirier is my father. Nice to meet you. It's my uncle. Sit down, please. - And your father? - He's not coming. He apologizes, but he met mom, so... You know... - What will you have? - A dry martini. If Lamotte doesn't come, you can keep the statue. I'll have to. Cigarette? American? English? - I don't want to deprive you. - Oh, come on! - These are great. - I have stockrooms full of them. I buy, I sell... I sell everything. If you need anything, just give me a call. I'm amazed. Poirier used to describe his son as a shy little boy. - He saw me changed. - I guess so. But the most stupefied was my mother. She had this little shop with debts. Then I took over, and 5 years later her store occupies half of the street. Wonderful! She must be happy. In fact, she's a bit offended. She shouldn't be. She's more lucky than me. How is your return going? Dad sent me to find out. My return isn't going well. We can't hear each other because of them! You tell me that the woman is adorable? You have a crush, that's a fact. You may not even realize it yourself. What is he saying? If I was you, I know what I'd do. I'd marry her and I'd get my apartment back. What a joker! It's not a joke. Oh, these guys! Americans and Brits, soon they'll be polishing each others' mugs. I tell you, you have a crush. You just have to come at her... Well, at your place... ...with a bunch of flowers. It's how all the love stories begin! It's my bad luck again: she's married! Then we have to kill the husband. But really... No! I'm too fed up with disappointments to see the allies fighting each other! It's stupid to behave like that! If you want to fight, go away! These guys are brutes. What are you saying? Krauts, damned Krauts... - That Kraut bastard... - Shut up, they're Americans. You didn't get it. This poor guy with his statue... It's a gift! And you're mocking at his face. He's the 1,500,000th POW who's back, you understand? Yeah, right, buzz off. Get out of here. It's all right, it's all right. It's not your fault, anyway. Are you OK? I'm fine. Luckily, "The Grateful France" isn't solid. If he's joking, he's all right. Take it. That's all that left. I don't even remember what's it for. - No, no! - They're brutes! You believe everything they tell you! They say: "You and the Allies are the cream of the world, and the enemy is a savage". But savages are everywhere! Sadly! A book about our return should be called "The Grand Disillusion". Not true! There's still a whole lot of decent guys. That's what gives me the courage to live. Is it a gift? You have a new scratch! Why do you look so sad? Not many reasons to be happy with my return. Things will be better. The wheel is turning. For now it blocks the road. - Have you seen your lodgers? - Yes. - Do you stay up there? - On the 6th floor. I don't like him. I like his sister better. What sister? Is there a sister there too? No, the mother of three. They're not a married couple? Not at all! Hello, mam. - Is there any mail? - Yes. He's her single brother. And she's widowed for 3 years. Are you crazy, man? Poor guy, after Stalag he's not quite himself. Good day, sir! - What a beauty! - Couldn't find anything better. Will you have a meal with us? - No. - But why not? My brother can't join us. And, finally, the return of Louis. Maman! Petit Louis! Look at me! You're thinner, but it's you! - How have you been doing? - It was hard, but we toughed it out! - And Yvonne? - She's well, the child too. The sad thing is Fernand. He had to have a leg amputated. - Petit Louis! - Look at you -- no thinner! They call it adipose anemia. It's the worst kind! Toast of honor, everyone! - I have so much to tell you! - And me! - Come on, the mayor's waiting. - Just a minute. I would have liked to explain earlier, but here we are. Maman, I'm not here alone. - Not alone? I've brought my wife. You ... Is she ... - What? - She's not German. - She's the woman I love. In her country, everything's destroyed. Razed to the ground. I brought her back. - You didn't think. Yes I did. Of Uncle Henri, and lots of others. What of it? Elsa is Elsa. Go kiss her. - Everyone's looking. That's the point. You can, you must. Elsa is your daughter. - You're asking me ... - I'm asking if you love me. That's all. She doesn't understand French, I don't understand German. Tired? ... There. - Mr. Mayor, you must do something. - What? We've seen such cases in the paper. - You, former POWs -- do you allow this? - We're back. - We're happy. - We don't give a damn. Your health, Madame Pallu! - Come along, the wine will do you good. - You don't realize ... - What? The wine's for returning POWs, no? And their wives? Why not us? - It would be better to wait. - No, we're going right now. Is he bringing that Kraut over? I'll remind him where I lost my eye. Don't get excited. No scenes. Leave it to me. Hello, everyone! Come on, boys, cat got your tongue? We're happy to have you back safe and sound. I drink to your mother, who's never lacked courage. And to your health. There are three of us. Why only two glasses? Maman. Elsa. I'll drink at home, on the farm. Our custom there is to give bread to whoever knocks at the door. Without asking who he is or where he comes from. Your Honor, thank you for your hospitality. Greetings, people of my village. He came near to insulting us! The Germans didn't leave quietly. Your sister and Fernand were in the Resistance. They fought. That meant more deaths, more burned farms, more hate. I wasn't there, nor was Elsa. We didn't kill anyone or burn any farm. Bad enough there are wars ... ... but if we don't stop fighting once they're over, how will it end? - There are unhealed wounds. - There's love, too. Are you all right? In five minutes we'll be home. Our home. Understand? Funf minuten! Her father, mother, brothers ... dead. "Disappeared," they say back there. She didn't want to come with me. She was afraid they wouldn't like her in France. I told her French people were smarter than that. Suffering through the war had taught them. Yvonne will be the hardest to convince. More potatoes? Oh, no, Mother! You're not going to learn German! Just one word. To be kind. One word. Then another. Then we'll all do it, the child too. - Don't be silly. - I won't have my son call me "mutter"! Maybe that's why we fought. - For words. - Words matter. We fought so the Germans would go home. - So they did. - But Fernand didn't. For eight months he's been suffering in hospital. Who knows if he'll ever be well. It's not our fault, Yvonne. She's sitting in his chair. It's worse than unjust -- it's insulting. Do you want Elsa to go? I spent four years in camp, pacing in circles. There were hundreds of thousands of us. We had nothing to do but think. The one thing worse than wars' cruelty is their stupidity. It would be a shame to have it be for nothing. At least we're less stupid. Meanwhile, they made us suffer. Really suffer. - You made money, too. Do you blame us for working the farm? While you carried on with your Kraut? I'll let you say that. No one who idled for five years can criticize us who worked. "Idled"? I'll let that pass. I know what you and Mother suffered. But I'm asking for something different. From the heart. Can you understand? They tortured Fernand. Maman, honestly, what should we do? I don't know. Not you! What? Speak French! Touching Fran√ßois is out -- verboten, know that word? - She meant well! - Don't care! If Fran√ßois is hurt because of her --! Everyone feels the same way! She's got to go! The others are brave enough to say it. - That was brave of them. - It's just a warning. It'll get worse. They're right! We shaved the heads of women who slept with Germans! German women sleeping with Frenchmen are whores too! - Yvonne! - If she stays, I go. Don't worry -- with Fernand mutilated and a baby on my hands, I'll be fine! If you didn't have a baby on your hands, I'd slap you. Try it! You idiot! Shut up! Get out of here! Thanks for coming back! Leave it to me. I'll calm her down. Her, yes. But the others? They'll try something else. They might burn the farm down. They know us and respect us. When patriotism's aroused, spite takes advantage of it. Look at Elsa. My child, don't cry so. How do you say "patience" in German? She said it to me often, when I was thinking of home. Elsa, forgive me. I knew it would be hard, but not like this. I'll give you back all that, Elsa. Oh, please don't say that. We'll win out, you'll see. Are these all the curlers you have, M. Gaillard? Another year of war and they'd stop making them, Mme. Pallu! What size do you take? - 42. Look! Strolling around like she belongs here! Do you believe it? There are decent shopkeepers who sell to her! - Business is business. - She's coming this way! Fine -- I'll show her. Good day, everyone. I'd like to introduce you to Petit Louis' wife. Elsa is her name. I'd like some cloth -- - We're out. - But I saw it last week -- - I don't have any. I don't sell cannons, machine guns, or barbed wire for concentration camps. I sell nothing a German would want. Pity. I also wanted to buy her a missal ... ... so she could learn the French for "Love thy neighbor." Another time. Come along, my child. - In a way, she's right. - Oh, please, Mme. Pallu! Her menfolk in Germany should have taught her to love her neighbor! It's too late now -- forget it! We had the Germans in 1914, in 1940 ... WELCOME HOME POWS - Louis here? - Not yet, Your Honor. Hooray for Town Hall! Hello, Your Honor. Well, Your Honor. - I've been hearing a lot about this. - Well, everyone's talking. I've been getting letters, anonymous and signed, threatening me -- me! - Well, people think -- - Same for me. - People think officials should act. - Not Town Hall! When we found out the blind beggar by the church was only deaf -- -- he got written up. And that old guy who used to hang around the girls' school ... Ancient history. Nothing to do with this. He means that public offenders should be handled by the rural police. Exactly. You know how I feel personally. But what do you want me to do? I don't want to overstep, but I lost an eye in 1914 and a nephew in 1940. If Louis had married a different wife, you'd still be missing eye and nephew. But when other people act right, it helps me bear up. When they forget so soon, it hurts. It's way too soon to wipe the slate clean! - That's reasonable. - But love isn't reasonable! What are we supposed to do? Hello, everybody. Hello, our Honor. Good to see you again. Louis, I'm glad you're here -- and that you came alone. Elsa stayed home to help Mother. But she's fine, thanks for asking. - Sit down for a friendly chat, eh? - No, I just wanted to return this. In case you need it again. - Louis, you should understand -- - What? Do I ask what happened while I was gone? Who slept with who? Profiteered? No! I can still mill your flour and feed your pigs. Good show, all! You really stood up to him! Now he's mad at me. Pigs, he says! That's nice. Hearing Petit Louis, I realized what we must say to him. You must be hot in those clothes! Petit Louis, we've finally figured out what we need to say to you. Good for you. Let's hear the speech. - That's just it -- it's not a speech.. I'll just read the names of your neighbors who died for France. My mother already told me, you know. I knew them all -- some were friends. - Be quiet and listen. Beno√Æt, Fernand -- died in combat. Chaput, Ren√© -- died as a deportee. Allenard, Victor -- shot by Germans. Gauniet, Emile -- died in combat. Lesable, Eloi -- died a prisoner. Bardeu, Joseph -- died in the maquis. Sigeon, Marc -- shot by Germans. Sigeon, Jean-Marie -- shot by Germans. Well? - You don't understand? - What? You've got eight names there. If mine were the ninth, would that do? I could tell you Elsa saved me from pneumonia with her poultices. That wouldn't be true. I wasn't sick a day. I'm strong and healthy; that's why I love Elsa. She's my wife. That won't change. I knew the Sigeon brothers better than you. They'd choose my happiness over your little serenade. We'll leave it at that, before we say something we'll regret. I agree. - Come on. - One thing more -- do as you like. You put words in the mouths of Marc and Jean-Marie -- who knows? But I gave my eye -- and I know what I think. You didn't give your eye. It was taken from you. If you could have ducked, you would have. - I lost it -- it's all the same! - Oh, no. If you understood me, your other eye would grow larger and see for two. - That makes no sense to me. - Like your visit to me. This gets us nowhere! Come on. - Shake hands? - Really! - Where's Elsa? - She went indoors when they started with their music. Help! Help! What is it? - Elsa threw herself in the pond! - Where? I'll get Louis! She needs artificial respiration ... - Get her to the farm. - No, the village. Run for the doctor! Hurry! Let the doctor through. - Can she be saved? - We'll tell you as soon as we can. Everybody out now. Move them on. - Any better? - No. The doctor is doing what he can, but ... Everyone brought clothing for her. I brought sabots -- Do you bury a dead woman in sabots? What can we say to Petit Louis? Oh, I don't understand. I swear I meant what I said -- -- everything I said about her came from my heart. Now I'd give anything to save her. Don't try to explain. It can't be explained. Hey! Something's happening ... - Well? - She just opened her eyes. - Well? - Your fraulein is saved! - We were scared! - The rural police, your sister, everyone helped! We all brought something -- I brought sabots!
