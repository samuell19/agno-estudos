Couple of more minutes, we'll be blowing the suds off some nice, long Colas. The desert. I'd personally give it back to the Indians. When you get to the bridge, stop. Halverson said he'd meet us in town. Might miss him. We shouldn't have come back here. Mind your own business. They didn't fix it. Why don't you take a picture of it? Shut up. I've got a picture of it... in my head. Please, I'm in a hurry. Back up and let her through. - Did you notice, Johnny? - Yeah. I noticed. - Paula, you're supposed to-- - Where's Fritzi? At home. Didn't come down this afternoon. - Does she know that-- - No. And don't you call her and tell her. - No. - Hi! Window shopping? Yes, but we don't like what we see. It's too cheap. I ought to give you a ticket for that. It'd be worth it. The way they jumped. Like two hens. You might've killed 'em. It was self defense, they're throwing knives at me. There's still one stickin' in your back. Here, I'll pull it out for you. - Glad to see me? - Not particularly. I'm glad to see you, too. Let's have a drink. What's new in Chuckawalla? - Crime or gossip? - Any difference? Depends on where you're sittin'. Always has. Why'd you come back? The big city scares me. I'm a small-town girl. How long you gonna be this time, Paula? - Long time, I think. - What does your mother think? Give me a cigarette. I'm a big girl now, I'm allowed to play with matches. Hello, Mr. Bendix. Hanson... Tom Hanson. - You remember good. - Some things I remember good. I don't suppose I'll forget you. Stayin' around here? - Halverson Ranch. - Business? Coppers! All the same. Big mouths. - Always asking questions. - I was talkin' to him. - I'm answerin' ya. - Go find out about Halverson. Coppers. All the same. You were sayin'? I was askin' if you were here on business. No, nothing like that. I just came out to be on the desert. Oh. What's your name? My name is Paula... Paula Haller. I'll make it formal. Paula, meet Mr. Bendix. We've met. On the bridge, coming into town. - Glad to know you. - Halverson couldn't wait. He left the keys. Alright, let's go. Haller. Paula Haller. - Who is he? - A very important man. A gambler. How come you know him? I met him on the same bridge a couple years ago. He's very handsome. Depends on where you're sittin'. Always has. I guess I better go see Fritzi. - So long, Tom. - So long. - I'll knock your teeth in! - Take it easy, Pat! Hello, Tom. - Desperate criminal? - One of them railroad workers. Blew his dough and threw a rock in a window. Mm, that's even more serious. Destruction of public property. Everything's public in Chuckawalla, bud. Everybody owns everything. Oh, lay off, Tom, this one's stubborn. - Won't tell me his name. - Shh! Don't you tell him. We're in this together, we won't talk till I get us a lawyer. Pat: I don't know why I put up with you, Tom. I don't know either. The only way to handle these tramps is to kick 'em around till they find out who's boss. Sure, Pat, I'll put him in the cooler. Alright. Hear you're gonna break a pony tomorrow. - Gonna try. - You're crazy. That's me. Oh, yes. I knew I came in to tell you something. - Eddie Bendix's in town. - Yeah? He's stayin' at the Halverson Ranch. - Why? - Didn't say. Just thought I'd tell you. Don't you worry about it, Pat. You've got nothin' he wants. Or have you? - Oh, hello, Miss Paula. - Hello, Rosa. How are you? Your mother wants to see you. - Tell her I'll be right down. - She knows you're here. Mike called her from the Purple Sage. Fritzi: Paula? Paula, come in here. She told me to tell you the minute you came in. Fritzi: Paula! Paula, darling, you were going upstairs without even saying hello. Hello, Fritzi. Hello, judge. I had a long trip, I was tired. I thought I'd freshen up. You look good to me, baby. Even when you're tired. Doesn't she, judge? Doesn't she look good? She looks beautiful. Sit down, baby. Give me a kiss, honey. With your permission, ladies, I'll leave. No, judge, I want you to stay. What for? To pass sentence? Quick isn't she, judge? Quick temper, quick decisions. Family trait. Now, judge, you know me better than that. I never make quick decisions. I think about things a long time. - I just act quick. - Alright, mother. Let's have it. It was Fritzi a minute ago. An easy, friendly, Fritzi. Now, it's mother. When she knows she can't get anything out of me it's mother, and it comes out hard as a rock. Well, it seems to me there's nothin' to be gained in situations like these by anybody Iosin' their temper. Now, my advice-- Will be exactly what Fritzi tells you to say. Well, there's truth in that. You've just got a weak character, judge. Yes, Fritzi, you found that out a long time ago. Alright, this time, why? - Same reason. - This is the fifth school. It wouldn't make any difference if it were the fiftieth! - Then it'll be fifty. - No, it won't. Why are you any different than anybody else? You mean his daughter? She was born to go to finishing school. The little snob. I just met her on the street a while ago. She was with your wife. They both cut me dead. I'll talk to her. What'll you tell her, judge? That there's really no difference between us? That you're one of Fritzi's partners? That you make your money the same way Fritzi does? Except you get paid off in back alleys so that you can stay respectable? Oh, don't talk like that. - The judge-- -Judge! Even the title's phony. He's tryin' to be nice, he said he'd talk to her. He's been talking to her ever since I was eight years old. Well, you're not eight years old anymore. No. I used to cry when I was eight. But you don't cry anymore. No, I'm like you now, Fritzi. I'm getting more like you everyday. Like mother like daughter. - Two very charming-- - Oh, shut up! Is it alright for me to go upstairs now, mother? Now, look, baby, I don't wanna fight with you. You know I don't wanna fight with you. Is it? Yes, it is! - Pour me a drink, Berle. - Fritzi, my dear-- Pour me a drink. Hello? It's the sheriff. Oh. You talk to him. Certainly. Hello, Pat. Fritzi doesn't feel too well. She asked me to talk to you. Yes. Alright, Pat. Pat told me to tell you that Eddie Bendix's in town. - Eddie Bendix? - Yes. Seems like he's taken a lease on the Halverson ranch. Looks as though he'll be around for a while. Eddie Bendix. He's an old friend of yours, isn't he, Fritzi? You say that as though you didn't know. Did Pat say why he'd come here? He told me to ask you that. Tell him I don't know, either. - Goodbye, Berle. - I'd like to explain to you-- Goodbye, Berle. You haven't taken your drink, Fritzi. It'll keep. Paula? Yes, mother. Come here, baby. I'm glad you're home. Really, I am. Thanks, Fritzi, thanks very much. Tell me, baby. Why did you leave this time? The usual reasons. "Where do you come from? Who are your folks? What do you they do?" And you always tell 'em? You don't want me to lie, do you? Why not? I'm not ashamed of you. - Do you want me to be? - No. Fritzi, I-- I'm so much older than they are. Oh, you just think you are. They're just babies, they don't know what they want. - And you do? - Yes. - Mind telling me? - I'm going to stay here. And do what? Work with you at the Purple Sage. Now, you listen to me. You even go near that place and I'll... Here I go blowin' up again. We'll talk about it later, huh, baby? We'll talk about it now. Alright, if that's the way you want it, the answer is no. That's not what I have in mind for you. What do you have in mind for me, Fritzi? What put the idea into your head? - You tell me, Fritzi. - You tell me! Alright, because that's what you do. I used to work in a silk mill, in Patterson, New Jersey. I used to make eight bucks a week, you wouldn't like that. I had one pair of shoes and one dress. My father was a drunk and my mother didn't care. For me, it was any way out, but for you... Fritzi, people come to you, they do as you say. And that's for you? Yes, that's for me. You are crazy, baby. You'd come running to me at the first sign of trouble. - Try it and see. - I don't have to. I know. Look, if something's eating you, tell me, I'll handle it like I always do. No, Fritzi, this is one time you're not handling anything. - Eddie? - Yeah. You gotta cut it out. Gotta get it off your mind. You know how? She's probably in the back room. You want me to find her? There's no hurry. Let's see what kind of a layout she has. Place your bets. No more bets. Thirteen black... Good evening, Mr. Bendix. Man 1: Here we go. - Get it down... comin' out. - Come on, Kevin. Seven and he missed it. - Oh, hello, Mr. Bendix. - Hi, Chuck. Hello, Johnny. - Change the dice. - You're kidding. - Aren't you, Mr. Bendix? - Come on, give me the dice. Man 1: Okay, everybody down in time. Next shooting, comin' out, hands up, please. Eight's the point, the point is eight. - Alright, folks... Paula: Excuse me. Uh, hold it, Mr. Bendix. I'm sorry, Miss Paula. It's good money. Not at this table, it isn't. You don't wanna get me fired, do you? Fritzi won't fire you, Chuck, you've got too much on her. I'm sorry, those are her orders. Here you are, Miss Haller. Shoot for me. - Why, thanks. Man 1: Alright, comin' up. Man 1: Six, six and eight. A six and a two. She made it! Let it ride. Keep shooting, Miss Haller. Man 1: Try your luck again. Here we go. Everybody down in time. Comin' out. Chuck: Eleven! The dice are hot. It rides again. You bring me luck. Man 1: Eleven, that's in the field. Pay the line. Just a minute till Eleven pays off. Coming out. - Everybody down in time. - Coming out again. Put the dice please. Man 1: Comin' out, here we go. Man 1: Six! Chuck: Six is the point. Chuck: The point is six. Man 1: Hands up, please. Man 1: Coming out again, everybody in time. And she made it, the hard way. - A lucky woman. - Coming out again. Coming out again, everybody in time. I didn't know you had all that talent, Paula. - I come by it naturally. - Hello, Fritzi. Hello, Eddie. I told her how you felt, Fritzi. - I asked her to shoot for me. - So I was told. - Any objections? - Same old Johnny. It's a pretty big loss for you to take. - I can stand it. - Gimme the dice, Chuck. Man 1: Comin' out, okay, everybody down in time. Chuck: An ace and a deuce, the man missed it. You're pretty good, aren't you, Mr. Bendix? - I'm perfect, Chuck. - You did that deliberately. Don't be silly, only a sucker would do a thing like that. I'd like a drink and a little talk with you. You can have 'em both in my office. And I'll see you at home. Nice looking place you got here. Why not? I practically live here. And, uh, nice looking daughter. And a nice looking daughter. To what? The good old days. - What was good about 'em? - Nothing. That ain't true. The people were good, they had guts. - Like your old man. - My old man. You never got married again, Fritzi? - No, did you? - No. You did pretty good on your own. Not much. Small fry. Miners, railroad workers, broken-down cowboys. - You're the one that did good. - Yeah. I did good. A guy like you figured to. I just wiped that out of my eye. That, uh, kid of yours... - Your daughter. - What about her? She likes to gamble, it's in her blood. Yeah, like her old man. Show her a pair of dice-- She doesn't look like you. Thought you wanted to talk. Reminds me of someone I used to know. I thought so too, at first, then I got a better look-- Nobody's asking you. Alright, now we talk. I caught me a visit today from the sheriff. - Yeah? - I didn't like it. - Nobody likes sheriffs. - Call him off. - Me? - Don't play straight with me. - He's your boy. Call him off. - Why? Because I say so! Or maybe for old time's sake. Do I owe you anything from the old days? No, but I don't want anybody bothering me. Take it easy, Eddie, maybe she-- Shut up! What's the matter with you, Eddie? I don't like anybody conning me. Alright, I sent him. Oh, excuse me. I thought you'd gone. I said I'd see you at home. I, I was waiting for you. I, I want to go home with you. - I'll be outside. - It's alright. I'm through. Just one more thing. Did you tell him to ask me all those questions? - What questions? - About my wife. The accident, the way she died. No, I didn't, must've been his idea. Eddie: Well, this is my idea, don't ever do it again. Eddie: Just don't. - Eddie, you can't blame me. You blow into town the way you do. I told that copper, the young one, that I came here to be alone. The word's around that you got squeezed out of Vegas. Any time Eddie wants to go to the post, he's back. Fritzi: I don't know how to figure. I got a pretty good set up here. Maybe you ought to move in. Maybe I want to go back to pitching pennies, too. And I want nothing from you, Fritzi. I don't want nothing from nobody. I just wanna be left alone. The way you left me alone? That's how he's been, Fritzi. Ever since-- That's how I've been! Do like I tell you, Fritzi. Don't ask for trouble. Sure she does. Look at her now. Like you talk to me, mother. That's the way he talked to you. "Do like I tell ya, Fritzi." Go home! Yes, mother. - Hi, Hank. - Hi, Paula. - Watch it, boy. - Whoa, there, whoa! Be sure and cinch her down there, Tom. Come on, Tom. I'm ready, fellas. Ride him, Tommy! Paula: Come on, Tom! Stay with him, Tom. Attaboy, Tom. Come on! - You alright? - I'm okay. Who's gettin' broke, Tom, you or the horse? Three more tries and the pony can ride me. - Oh, yeah? - Leave him alone. Paula. Wait a minute. There ain't one of you drugstore cowboys ever seen a day you could ride with him. I'm going over to the bunk house. No, leave him alone, when something like this happens he don't want nobody around him, not even me. - Is he really that good, Pat? - Ain't he ever told you? Tom doesn't talk much about himself. - Oh. He was the best. - What happened to him? Well, he was wrestling a steer and slipped. Now, he's all busted up inside. He's not really thinking of going back to the rodeo, is he? All the time. And I keep saying to him, "Okay, "so, you make a comeback, you can never be as good as you used to be." And I say once a man's a champ, second-best is no good. He's probably over there with the pain eatin' his insides out. Best thing for a guy like Tom is to get himself a little ranch like he's always talkin' about. I think maybe you could talk to him now. Thanks, Pat. - Feeling better? - Yeah. What are you thinking, Tom? I'm thinkin' I just ain't got what it takes anymore. I think you have. You're just saying that. You don't know. I know you. Thanks. Feel like ridin'? - Do you think you should? - Sure. Fast. Me too. Paula: Nice view from here. Yeah, you can see Chuckawalla... if you want to. If you want to. Still mad? The ride worked it off a little. Me too. Fritzi? We had another fight last night. She slapped me. What'd you do? Slap her back? Oh, shut up. I'm shut up. She really loves me, Tom. She just doesn't understand me. Me too. You too, what? Love you. I know that. I don't know what I want. At least, not yet. I think I know. You're lookin' for what I used to get when I rode in the rodeo. The kick of havin' people say... "That's a mighty special person." I'd like to get that kick again. Maybe I can get it with just one person sayin' it. A nice view from here. You can see Chuckawalla. Yeah. And the snow on the mountains. And smoke coming out of the chimney. That's the Bar Triangle Ranch. I'd like to buy that place someday. - How far is it from here? - Oh, about eight, ten miles. It's just past Halverson's. Halverson's. That's where Eddie Bendix is staying. Tom: Yeah. - I saw him again last night. He came to the Purple Sage. He's a strange man. You're building it up. Did you know his wife? I only saw her after she was dead. I got there ten minutes after it happened. She went right through the guard-rail. It was a gory mess. - She... - She what? She was a beautiful woman. I imagined she was. Such a horrible accident. Yeah, accident. That's what it says in the record. I never could quite figure out why Bendix was driving another car. I think he's no good... for you. - Now you're building it up. Tom: Maybe. - Let's go back. - Sure. Rosa. Rosa! - Is she home yet? - No, ma'am. Take that thing out of here. I'll have one of the boys send your car over from the ranch. So long, Paula. So long, Tom. Alright, Fritzi. You win. I was wrong. I shouldn't have said what I did. I don't wanna win that way. I never slapped you even when you were a little kid. - Maybe you should have. - Maybe. I don't know, Paula. I can't seem to get through to you. I think it's the other way round. Maybe. I don't suppose there's any use in talking to you about going back to school. - No use. - Alright. We won't talk about it. Who'd you go riding with today? Tom. - Tom's a nice guy. - I think so. - Do you like him? - I like him. I have to go to Los Angeles on business. Might be a nice idea if you went along. Bought yourself some new clothes. - I don't need any. - Oh. A girl always needs new clothes. Go ahead. I can afford it. You can afford anything, can't you, Fritzi? Fritzi: Almost anything. We'll leave in the morning. What do you say, baby? We'll have fun. If you promise to tell the boys I'm your sister. Too much competition that way. - Your older sister. - Alright, it's a deal. Run upstairs now and get dressed. And we'll have dinner together. Get that horsey smell off you. Use my perfume, and plenty of it. I can't keep you in a school or out of the stables. I like stables. Hello, Pat. It's Fritzi. Tell Tom Hanson to come over to the Purple Sage tonight. I wanna talk to him. Right. Yes? - Hello, Fritzi. - Hello, Tom. Sit down. Pat said you wanted to see me. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. Stop acting as though you were gonna be ruined. Now, if I were ten years younger... But since I'm not, you can call me mother. Okay, ma. Tom Hanson... you're twenty eight, you come from Waco, Texas. You were a ranch hand. Then four years of barnstorming around the country in rodeos. The doctors say if you ride again you'll be killed. If it wasn't for Pat giving you this job as deputy, you'd be on your ear. If you had the money you'd buy a ranch, but you're broke, is that right? I was vaccinated when I was nine. They left that out of the report. I've had a detective agency on you. Do you mind? Did they tell you what happened the night I got drunk in Cheyenne? No, they didn't say anything about that. I hope the report cost you plenty. It did. Anything you really want, does. - Meaning what? - I found out you're honest. And you've got guts. I like that. You're smart, and you know the ropes. When you say you wanna settle here on a ranch, I believe you. But I paid cash to be sure. So far, it sounds like a bad investment. That's why I called you up tonight. To find out. I suppose you wonder why I keep sending Paula away. I never thought about it. She's 19. A woman. She hasn't any friends in this town except my, uh, business associates. It's not her fault. I guess it's mine. Anyway, I've got a problem on my hands. I wondered if you'd noticed. How would you like to marry Paula? Now we're getting somewhere. Is that why you put the Pinkertons on me? And I'll protect an investment with more capital. Tom, if you marry Paula, you'll get your ranch. A bigger one, better stocked than any you could buy yourself if you worked until you were 90. And how about Paula? Oh, she likes cattle and horses. That's one reason I picked you. What about the other reasons? Alright. We've been here ten years. The town has never accepted us. Not that I care. I wouldn't mix with them, anyway. But they have accepted you. You're one of them. And if she marries you, eventually they'll accept Paula. Fritzi: She'll get her friends. - I see. Any more? One thing more. I've seen you with her. You are in love with her already. That about wraps it up... doesn't it? - For me it does. - Where is Paula now? - Home. Why? - I'd like to talk to her. Okay... You can drop me off while you're at it. Paula. Are you awake? Paula: Yes. Come on down. Tom's with me. He wants to talk to you. Be right down. I think I'll go on up to bed. I'm tired. I want you to stay. Me? Why? What is it? Fritzi and I are cookin' up a deal. - It concerns you. - Tom! Paula, how would you like to marry me? Fritzi just offered me a ranch. A big one, if I'd marry you. I'd like to know what my chances are. - Paula, I... - What do you say? Thanks a lot, Tom, but... I don't think I'll be around here long enough to take you up on that. Some other time, maybe. Paula! Now what made you do a fool thing like that? If I want a ranch, I'll get one. If I wanna marry your daughter, that's my business. You deliberately set her against me. You're always pushing her around. One of these days, you're gonna push her right out of your life, when it comes, it won't be pretty. She needs me. I couldn't push her off if I wanted to. That's why she came home. She'll never leave me. Cut that light! What are you doin' out here alone at night? - What are you doing? - Go on, beat it. You heard me tell you to beat it. - Yes. - What do you want from me? Nothing. It's nice to meet somebody that doesn't want anything. This is where it happened, isn't it? - Where what happened? - The accident. - I know all about it. - Who told you? Tom. I asked him. Why? I just wanted to know. Why didn't you beat it when I told you to? Because I wanted to know you better. You don't pull your punches, do you? I've heard you don't pull yours. You're alright. Funny kid, but you're alright. Thanks. Can I drop you off anywhere? Well, it'd be a big help. Take me as far as the Halverson Ranch. Alright. That cop you were with today, what did he tell you when you asked who I was? Nothing. Look, I know cops. What did he say? He told me not to get interested. You're not paying much attention to him, are you? No. You know what you're getting into? Because unless you get out of here right now, you're going to find out. - That you, Eddie? - Get out of that light! I could pick you off like a clay pigeon. Where you been? I didn't hear you go out. Oh, I didn't know. I thought-- Get in the house, Johnny. Get out of here. Leave him alone! Get in the house! He's right. Maybe you better go. Maybe you better not come back. Why not? Because I'm not the kind of guy for you. You'll get your brains knocked out, kid. You're gonna wish you'd never seen me. You'll remember what I said. I'll remember. She carried the bags down to the car and when I saw she was really going I asked her if there was anything I could tell you but she wouldn't answer. She just got into the car and went. - Alright, Rosa. She'll be back. - Yes, ma'am. - Back so soon? - Yes, mother. Couldn't leave, could you, darling? No, mother. "Yes, mother. No, mother." What is it, baby? What is it? Is it the way I spoke to you before? - I'm sorry. - No, it's... I-- I don't know, Fritzi... What? I can't explain it, I-- I just started to cry, that's all. Must've been the storm. Even when you were a kid, you were afraid of storms. I used to have to sleep with you. You alright now? Yes, I'm alright. - If you want to, I'll-- - No. I'm alright. Sure, we'll go to Los Angeles tomorrow and do some shopping, see a show... I don't think I want to. Do you have to go? - Yes, don't you want me to? - No. I mean... I don't know what I need. The storm's almost over. You'll be able to sleep now. Goodnight, baby. Goodnight, Fritzi. You want some more coffee, Eddie? I'll get it for you. It's nice out here. I must be getting old, sitting in the sun. That's what you're supposed to do. Rest, sun... First thing you know, you'll be ready for anything. Down to LA, pick up the boys... You must get fed up playing nursemaid to me. We've been together a long time. Hi! - Hello, kid. - Hello. How about some coffee? Bring three cups with you, Johnny. - You remember Johnny? - Yes, I remember him. I'm supposed to apologize to you for talking to you the way I did last night. How do you want it? You've got a funny way of apologizing. Johnny: I'm workin' up to it gradually. Just go get the coffee. Excuse me. My manners stink! - Get home alright? - Yes, I got home alright. - Sit down. - Thank you. - What about you? - What do you mean? How do you live? What do you do? - Oh, nothing much. - Do you like it out here? I'm used to it, my mother brought me here when I was a kid, we come from New Jersey. My father was a bootlegger. He was killed. - I don't remember him. - I do. - You knew him? - Yeah. We were in the same racket. - Did you know Fritzi? - A long time ago. She ran a speak after... After your old man got it. Tell me, what was Fritzi like then? I didn't know her very well. You two don't get along together, do you? Okay, skip it. It's none of my business. But it is your business. Don't make that mistake, kid. I didn't mean it that way, I wasn't trying to commit you. Don't. It won't do you any good. I didn't come here to do myself any good or to be told off either. Nobody's telling you off. And nobody's going to. I don't think I like your brand of hospitality, Mr. Bendix. Now, wait a minute-- You can push Johnny around if he likes it, but I don't like it, not from you or anybody. Take it easy. Don't go. I came here without being asked, I can leave the same way. - Hello, child bride. - Hello, Tom. - Sore at me? - Of course not. You did the only thing you could. I'm not so sure. I always wanted a ranch. Only I don't know about your cooking. Soda? Yes, please. Maybe I should've taken the offer anyway. Why? What were you doing out at the Halverson Ranch the other night? I was minding my own business. I was too. Cruising the highway out by the State Bridge. About the time you came out of the private road and headed for town. Don't go out there again. Now, wait a minute, Tom. I mean what I say, Paula. When you tangle with someone like Bendix, you just don't pick up your jacks afterwards and go home. I'm telling you to stay away from there. And what's it got to do with you? Or have you changed your mind about wanting the ranch? After a crack like that, I ought to let you jump in over your head. But first, I'm gonna tell you something you should know. I can't stop you. So what? They brought her body down to us at the County Seat. I saw it and I have a good memory. - Somebody you knew? - No, she was nobody. But when I saw you for the first time, I remembered all over again. And I tried to tell it to you on the ridge... You look like her, Paula. - I look... - Too much like her. I see. Uh, thanks, Tom. Thanks for a very good turn. The drink's on me. - Hello, Paula. - Hello, Eddie. I've been waiting for you to come back. - Eddie? - Yeah. I know something now that I didn't know before. I know something, too. I've missed you. I was surprised how much. Get in. After the way you and Johnny treated me, I don't think I should. Alright, I found out I was wrong. I'm sorry. Now, get in the car. I don't think she wants to, bud. I don't think it's any of your business. You know it's a funny thing. You keep wishing for something to happen and then it falls right in you lap. - Like what? - Like bustin' you in the nose. - Blow! - Get out of that car! - Listen, copper-- - Eddie... hold it. Why don't you ask the girl? - You wanna go with him, Paula? - Yes. I'll go fix a fence. I know why you acted the way you did the other day. Why you brushed me off. - Yeah? - I look like her, don't I? A lot like her. I don't like smart dames. Maybe you better not stay very long this time either. Alright, if you say so. You can't say so, can you? Come on in. I'll show you the house. - Who does your house work? -Johnny. Oh. Johnny. A little messy, isn't it? It's a nice day. You ought to let it in. I like sunlight in its place, outside. Guess you're right. It is kinda messy. Johnny's a little behind with the dishes. Yeah. Quiet sleeper, aren't you? You've got sharp eyes. Yeah, I sleep quiet, I curl up like a kitten. You might help. Okay. - Those are loaders. - I know it. I was afraid you were gonna throw them in the fireplace. You carry a gun? The carpet sweeper's in the kitchen closet if you want it. - I'm sorry. - It's alright. You're a strange combination. You can recognize an automatic clip and you play house like you mean it. Kinda nice emptying those ashtrays. Funny about women... they never really creep up on you until you get 'em in your house where you can watch 'em tick. You shouldn't do that, kid. First thing you know, I'll be out of a job. Don't worry about it, Johnny, I'll see that you get your pension. Come on, Paula. Let's go outside where the air is fresh. This is what I like, Eddie... to be alone on the desert... with the sagebrush and the sky. Nobody looks down on you here. Yeah. It's nice. You don't like it the way I do. I can tell by the look on your face, like... You're thinking about something else. What have you been thinking about, Eddie? Tenement houses and back alleys. Eddie, what were you before I met you? Tough guy. No, I mean a long time ago before Johnny even met you. Oh, a kid, like you. Where'd you live when you were a kid? - Brooklyn, Ninth Ward. - What were you like? Oh, I don't know. Like any other kid. No... When did you meet Johnny? Bendix: I was your age. Maybe a year older. It was in the Automat, off Times Square about 2 o'clock in the morning, on a Saturday. I was broke, he had a couple of dollars. We got to talking. He ended up paying for my ham and eggs. And then? Eddie: I went home with him that night. I was locked out, didn't have a place to stay. His old lady ran a boarding house in the Bronx, there were a couple of vacant rooms. We were together from then on. How did you... How did I get into the racket? What difference does it make? Through Johnny. New York, Nevada... We've been together a long time. Long, long time. Where did you meet her? - New York or Nevada? - Angela? I met her in Las Vegas. What's it to you? - Nothing. - What do you wanna know? - Whether I was happy with her? - Yes. The way you keep talking about her, you'd think she was still alive. I'm sorry. There's too much pushing in my life as it is. - I wasn't. - It's alright. I didn't mean you this time. Johnny: Eddie! - Comin' in to eat? - Yeah, set the table for three. Johnny: Three? - Sure, you still live here. I wasn't sure. He doesn't like me. It's not his business to like you and it's not his business to pick my friends. Come on, let's go in. Paula? Paula? Remember me? I'm your old lady. Hello, Fritzi. When did you get back? Late last night. I figured you'd be asleep. Yes, I was asleep. Well, you don't seem very glad to see me. Oh, I-- I'm just surprised, I... I didn't expect you back until tomorrow. You look good, baby. Nice and fresh and alive. I like to see you dressed up. Where are you going? Going? Oh, I don't know... For a drive. I might go down to Vegas for the day. - Don't you want some breakfast? - I'm not hungry. Well, don't go. I haven't seen you for days. Sit down. Tell me where you been keepin' yourself? What you've been doing? - Hello? - Goodbye, Fritzi. Uh-- uh, just a minute. Paula? Hello? Yes, Mike. Well, I'll be down in a little while. It'll keep till then. - How does it come out? - I don't know. I'll look on the last page. It has a happy ending. It always has. They fall in love, they get married. This one ends when they fall in love. - Yeah. - That's what it says. - Read it. - Alright. "There was no need for words. "Her eyes told him what he wanted to know, that... "she was in love with him. He took her in his arms." Eddie: Alright, close the door. Pretty bad out there tonight. Going to bed? Yeah. Aren't you afraid the road might wash out on you? The storm's easing off, I don't think we'll have a flood. - It's still raining. - Not in the mountains. That's where the real water comes from. Couple of feet of water in the river bed. What's the matter, Johnny? Afraid you're gonna drown? If the road washes out, she won't get home tonight. - She can stay here. - Sure she can. Johnny: By sunrise, every cop on the desert will be pounding the door down. - You talk too much. - I don't talk enough! You think I'm gonna let you lose your head over-- The chances are better of you losing yours! Where do you think you're going? - Home. - Take off your coat. Johnny's right, if there's a wash-- Johnny's not giving orders around here. Alright, Eddie. I wasn't trying to give any orders. I only wanna keep you out of trouble. Take off your coat. Johnny: You heard what Eddie said. He wants you to stick around. - You're not like her at all. - Does it matter? Something went wrong somewhere, kid. Wrong? I'm not so sure I can get along without you. Have I broken a law? Nothing the Vehicle Code covers. Why did you stop me? This part of your job? I get around. I told you that day in front of the drug store, Paula. I wasn't listening. - What're you gonna do about it? - You tell me. You can always tell Fritzi. I always thought the best way to gentle a colt was to put a long rope on him. But I'm beginning to have my doubts. I think I've given you all the rope I'm going to. - You're going to? Tom: Me! You're getting to be just like Fritzi. You ought to get together with her. Tom: Maybe I will. Then you can both try to run my life. Can you run it, Paula? Do you know what you're doing? Yes! I know what I'm doing. - But why? - Because that's the way I feel. But a guy like Bendix, a cheap racketeer... He's no different than Fritzi. Except he's smarter at it and bigger and stronger. Tom: And that's important? To me, it is. Well, I guess that's it then. Is Fritzi down at the Sage? Yeah, she thinks I went to Vegas. You better get home, the road's bad further down. - If you follow me I'll-- - Thanks. I can make it home alright. I know my way. - So long, Tom. - So long. Come in. The wages of sin... Are very high. But you wouldn't know. How are you tonight, sucker? Wet and thirsty. - Do you drink-- - And smoke. But you don't go with girls. I don't like getting paid for it. I like to keep my amateur standing. Remind me to give you a hair-shirt for Christmas. It's against regulations. What did you come see me about? I'm trying to figure that out myself. Should I tell you? Shoot. You've thought it over. And you'd like me to make the offer again but you haven't the nerve to say it. You're no different than any of the others in this town. You want your share but you want it tied in a pink ribbon. - That's why I came here, huh? - Yes. - Could be. - Alright, then why did you? I just stopped in to get warm. You're the sucker, Fritzi. Fritzi: Tom. What did you come here for? Whatever it was, I'll take care of it myself. Hello, Johnny. Eddie up yet? No, he's still asleep. Mind if I sit here and watch? Alright with me. -Johnny? - Yeah. What do you want out of life? Well, everybody wants something. Money, love, travel, their own business... What do you want? Why do you wanna know? Oh, I-- I'm just curious. You're always with Eddie, you, you always seem to have been with him. But there must be some of you apart from him. What do you want for yourself? Why would there be some of me apart from Eddie? Two people can't fit in one life. You seem to think so. What if he retires or, or if he marries? He won't retire and he won't marry. - He married once. - It didn't turn out so good. Did you know her? Angela? Yeah. I lived with them too. I knew Eddie Bendix a long time before he met Angela and I'll know him a long time afterward. And I'll know him a long time after he leaves here. Eddie Bendix is wasting his time in a cactus graveyard. He wants to be here. Some guys don't know what they want. They go a little nuts for a while. But they get over it. Sometimes they don't. I wouldn't count on that. Someday, he'll leave you. You know it. He won't leave me. I come in too handy. - What do you mean? Why don't you ask him? -Johnny. Yeah? - Johnny, let's be friends. - Are you kidding? Eddie: Hey, you two. What's goin' on? - Just talkin'. - About what? - You. - Go and get breakfast. Alright, Eddie. What's the matter, kid? Johnny said you'd be leaving the desert soon. - The two of you. The squeeze play, huh? - He's pretty good at that. Are you? I haven't thought about it. He's trying to break it up between us. He hates me. Forget it. Eddie... If you love me, get rid of him. You can certainly throw it on the line, can't you? I didn't draw the line in the first place. He did. Eddie, I want you. I'm in love with you. Maybe Johnny doesn't belong here. And you? I'm beginning to like the desert. I'm beginning to like everything about it. When are we quitting the desert, Eddie? What's on your mind? Well, we don't go back pretty soon, we'll have trouble getting in to the swing of things. Your name still means something, but... if you drop out after a bad break... Go on. You and me. We know you weren't scared off. A bad deal like you got might happen to anybody. Some of the boys might get restless waiting around in LA. They might start thinking things like, uh... Maybe you're nervous about getting started again. Like you say, you and me, we know that isn't true. Sure. I only mention it to remind you how careful we've gotta be of your reputation. We've been building it up for 15 years. We don't want to throw it all away now. Couple of years, we can have the biggest gambling racket in the country. You've got everything to do it with. Looks, personality, contacts. It's out, Johnny. All of it's out. I'm quitting. - You mean you're kidding? No. Quitting! I wanna stay here in the desert. You're afraid to go back, Eddie, aren't you? You don't really think so, do you, Johnny? - And me? You'll be taken care of. What are you gonna do? Give me a gold watch? Watch is a nice touch. I hadn't thought of it. - Now, listen-- - I'll give you your cut. You can leave whenever you like. Alright, Eddie. Any way you want it. Only I won't leave either. I'll stay out here with you. No dice, Johnny. I want you to go. Chuckawalla, two, three. I thought you'd gone. Going down to the Sage? Nope. A-- aren't you feeling well? I feel fine. I think I'll take a run down to the village. I don't think you will. You know how to pick 'em, don't you? Don't you? Answer me! Yes, Fritzi. I know how to pick them. Well, is that all you have to say? What is there for me to say? Yes, it's true. I don't know how you found out, but it's true. Why? I don't know why I'm in love with him. You can't be in love with him. You don't know anything about love. I don't know anything about anything according to you. - If you did... - If I did? He's no good! Do you have any idea what I went through in order to bring you up? - You've told me. No, I didn't. Do you think I like living here? Do you think I like Pat and the judge and drunken miners? After your father died, and I found out I had something the matter with my lungs, I didn't wanna live. But I did. Only because of you. Because I wanted to give you something I never had. And it wasn't Eddie Bendix. Fritzi, these things happen. They also stop. Listen to me, Paula. You're never gonna see Eddie Bendix again. If you have any ideas about going out of that door... You better know I'll pick up the phone and call the sheriff's office. And I'll swear out a warrant for Bendix's arrest. On what charge? Don't you worry your head about that. Pat will do exactly as I tell him and so will you. Fritzi, he expects me. He's waiting for me. He'll wait a long time. - He'll come here looking for-- - I hope he does. Fritzi, let me telephone him. You just can't let him wait, not knowing. He'll know. And when he does, he'll blow out of town so fast-- No, he won't. I say he will. And I say you're not to see him or telephone him or get in touch with him in any way whatsoever. I'd rather see you dead first. I believe you would at that. You needn't swear out a warrant. I'm going up to my room. And you'll stay in your room till he blows out of town. Fritzi: Couple of days now. Pat: You can't keep her locked up forever. Fritzi: He'll scram when he finds out we mean business. Pat: I wouldn't be too sure of that because I tell you... Hello. Hello, this is Paula. Eddie? Is that you, Eddie? Is it you, Johnny? Let me speak to Eddie, please. This is Paula. I can't speak long. Can you hear me? - Get out of here. - Johnny, let me come in. - I've got to talk to Eddie. - He doesn't wanna see you. Now get away from here or I'll kill you. So help me, I'll kill you where you stand. Didn't I hear a car? Yeah. Wrong house. Was it? I was asleep. - Did she call? - No. I've been in the house all the time. Ugh, I've got an awful head. - You've been drinking too much. - Yeah. - She must have called. - Listen, Eddie. Listen to me. Quit thinkin' about her. You're makin' a fool out of yourself. You got a job to do in Vegas. A big job. Smart thing to do is to go back there now. That's the important thing. You sure that's what I oughta do? - Yes, I'm sure. - Well, I'm not doin' it. I'm goin' into town and find out what that kid's pulling. - Are you crazy? - Maybe. But nobody can make a sucker out of me. Eddie, forget it. Let it go! Eddie, you can't go in to town. Fritzi runs this part of the country. She'll have the sheriff on you. Go on. You're not giving it to me straight. What are you talkin' about? What did you do to make Paula stay away? Eddie, you're way off base. I'll find out in town. Johnny: Eddie, don't do it! - How did this get here? - I don't know. The woman who was here askin' for the wrong house. - She must have dropped it. - This is Paula's glove. The world is full of pigskin gloves. Not with her initials. Why did she leave here? - Look, Eddie... - Why did she leave? - I tell you... - Tell me? I was only trying... - Well? - Hello, Mr. Bendix. You got your mind set on trouble, haven't you? Look, I'm in hurry. Just give me a ticket and I'll be on my way. - Get out. - I said I'd take the ticket. What else do you want? My autograph or just a little cash? - Get out. - Wait a minute. You're getting out of line. I know you're anxious to be on your way, and I'm sorry to have to do this. You ought to have a little more respect for the law, bud. You don't think nothin' of hurtin' my feelings. You'd better come along with me and talk this over. - Soberin' up? - What's that? When I tell a drunk to get out of a car, I expect him to get out. Tom: No monkey business. - Who's drunk? You are. Go ahead. Walk. Show me how sober you are. Look, I gotta get outta here. I don't know what you want, but if it's money, I'll give it to you. That sounded like a bribe. - What do you want? Tom: Nothin'. I just like to meet big shots. You're burned about Paula. - You're taking it out on me. - Shut up! - You're a chump. - I said shut up! Why don't you throw her in the clink, too? That's one way of holding on to her. I don't need too much of an excuse. Well, you better do it quick, because I'm on my way over to her house. - I'm taking her outta here. - Yeah? - Tonight. - And she'll go with you? - You're sure of that? - I'm sure. Yes, I guess she will. Bendix, listen to me and listen good. This one is not going to wind up like the other one. I don't know what you're talkin' about. I saw your face that night, and I remember good, too. You got away with that one, because nobody could prove anything. And you could fix things, but this time out, because no matter where you are, I'll know and I'll get you. - Lecture over, copper? - No. So you'll remember. I'll remember. So you went out there anyway. - In spite of what I told you. - Yes. Go inside. You shouldn't have done that, Paula. Taken my car. Sit down. Were you out there all this time? No, I left about an hour ago. Where were you then? Just driving around. I suppose you know what this means. I won't see him again. I'll promise if you like. He won't get away with it, either. Pat's gonna pick him up in the morning. Leave him alone. I'll do whatever you tell me. Who's that? It's Bendix. What happened to you? - You got a deputy named Hanson? - Yeah. If he were smart, he wouldn't be a deputy no more. - If you broke the law... - You're slow on the take. Get rid of him! I want him without a badge when I'm ready. And I want you to get out of my house. Sure. Quick. Get your coat. We're gonna get married. - Eddie. - Yes or no? I'll get my coat. Arrest him, Pat. Arrest him now. I gotta have a warrant. Uh, law is the law. Well, book him on suspicion. You told me you could reopen the case on the death of his wife. - New evidence. - I never said no such thing. Don't you know when to give up? - No. - The man's no chump. - He knows who Eddie Bendix is. - I can't, Fritzi. You've done a lot of things you can't. You'll do one more now. - I'm ready. - Paula. - It's no use, Fritzi. - Paula, baby. I'm not a child anymore. I know what I want. Listen to me. He's not for you. - He's just a cheap crook. - Come on, kid. A cheap crook. Look, I'm trying to be nice. I'm in the family. - Well, pick your own kind. - Who, you? - Eddie! - She asked for it. I asked for it. But it's true, Fritzi. You are his kind. So am I, because I'm your daughter. I'm not a simple little schoolgirl anymore. Paula, baby, you don't know what it will be like. How could you know what it's like the way I feel when I'm with him? I know more about it than you think. Alright, now I'll ask nice. - Leave her alone. - I can't. - Anything you want. - She's what I want. Look, Fritzi, I'll see if I can make you understand. A guy is alone. All his life he's alone. All his life he keeps looking not to be alone. - Let's go. - Eddie! Eddie, I-- I-- I wanna talk to you alone. Whatever you've got to say, say in front of me. Listen, Paula, I knew him when he just started out. He and I... Yes, Fritzi... He used to work for your father. That was when he first started out to double-cross the world. How well did you know him, Fritzi? You think he's big-timer, don't you? Fritzi: Well, he's not. - How well did you know him? Well enough to know that he's not good enough for you. Go ahead, Fritzi, tell her. You don't think I have nerve enough to, do you? I don't think it'll make any difference. Come on, Paula. No, wait a minute. I want to hear about you and Eddie. Alright. He wanted me the way he wants you now. Yes, he promised to marry me, too. Well, now you know. That oughta be enough. No, no, it's not enough. Not for me, it isn't. Tell her the rest. Tell her how I walked out on you. Sure, I'll tell her. He found out I had to come out here. To the desert. That meant money and doctors. A lot of years maybe. So he ran out on me. Just the way he'll run out on you the minute he doesn't need you anymore. That's her story. The way he's run out on everything in his life. For the same reason. You don't believe me, do you? You don't believe a word I've said. No, I don't. I don't believe you'd stop at anything to keep me from going away with him. You want me to tell you why, Fritzi? No. Now, get out of here. Both of you. Fritzi, I... She's gone. Nineteen years... I would have done it for you, Fritzi, if I could. Nineteen years... like that. - Where are we going? Eddie: Vegas. We're coming back here afterwards. I hope I never see the place again. What made you change your mind? - Tom? - Be quiet. Oh, Eddie, I didn't mean it that way. I know what you meant. Don't ever say that again. Don't talk to me like that, Eddie. I'm going to be your wife. Fight the rest of the world if you have to, but not me. I'm sorry, kid. I'm a little jumpy. Well, that's alright, Eddie. What about you and him? - Who? - The copper, Tom. - I'm here with you, Eddie. - That don't mean nothin'. Who have you got in your head? What are you thinkin' about? You're thinkin', maybe you made a mistake? No, I'm not thinking that. Well, nobody walks out on me. Eddie, look out! Eddie, take me with you. Get away or I'll chop your hands off. You can't leave me stranded out here in the desert? - Go on. Beat it. - At least take me to Vegas. I'll go nuts out here. Eddie, take him to where he can catch a train. Let's not leave any loose ends behind. Yeah, he'd probably set fire to the ranch and stick me for the bill. Hop in, loose end. I got a bag in the side of the road. Well, get it! I hope you never get finished with me. - No? - No. I'd hate to be left alone on a desert road at night. It won't hurt you to keep it in mind. You may as well earn your ride. Drive. Here. Give me one. You're out. Stop at the next place you come to. I'll be right out. So you won the grand prize, eh? Have I, Johnny? So you're really going through with it. You're gonna marry him. He won't quit, you know that. I know. He told me he was going back. Nobody listens. He's angry because he was beaten up by Tom Hanson. Yeah? See what happens when I'm not around. - He'll get over it. - You wanna bet? Ah, here they are. Don't often get a call for that brand, but I knew I had one somewhere. What's wrong? Johnny say something? A cup of coffee, please. Yeah, I'm kinda hungry, too. Look, we'll be here all night. Alright, we'll take a couple of hamburgers. In the back. Come on. What's the matter, bud? Ain't we good enough for you? Hey. Ain't we your type? I said, ain't we quite your type? No, you ain't. I don't like the way you said... - Sit down and shut up. - Just kiddin'. Oh. Man 2: Alright, folks. All aboard. That was a cruel thing to do. Nobody asked him to shoot off his big mouth. Supposing Johnny didn't have a gun? Oh, Eddie's always got an ace. A gun. Me. He's got quite a technique for coolin' off wise guys. Reminds me of the time the 21 dealer tried to spring a crooked deck on Angela. Remember, Eddie? About a week later, his widow got a couple of thousand bucks. Special delivery. Did he have any kids, Eddie? I forget. - What are you trying to pull? - Nothin'. - It's true, ain't it? - Get out of here. - Get out of here! - No, I want him to stay. - Why? - I want him to tell me. - Tell you what? - About you. The way I am, that's the way you'll take me. Eddie: This is the end of the line for you, Johnny. The rest of the way we go alone. No, Eddie, you've done enough walkin' out on me for one night. It's gettin' monotonous. I've been tied up with you too long to go on alone. - Then knock yourself off. - I don't have to. What do you mean? You're safe as long as I care what happens to me. But I don't care anymore. You either take me with you, or... - Or what? - I'll sing. - About what? - About Angela. I'll tell 'em what really happened. - You cheap double-crossin'-- - Sit down, Eddie. Sit down, I said. And you. I'm gonna tell you a few things about Eddie Bendix. - Eddie Bendix and me. - Listen, Paula. Whatever he says, he's saying because he's sore I'm walking out on him. - Go on, Johnny. - I won't tell you again. You forget, Eddie. Eddie, here is a real smart guy. Good lookin'. Got class. There's only one thing he ain't ever been able to pay the piper. That's where I come in. I paid for him. Fritzi said something like that. Johnny: We were gonna be big-shots together. I planned it that way for 15 years. - You got your end. Johnny: More than my end. I also took the rap. Any time there was a rap to take, I took it. - One year on that Federal job. - We agreed. Sure, we agreed, you'd have gone all to pieces and told them everything they wanted to know. Wash yourself up for good with the boys in Nevada. - Paula, listen to me. - I'm listening to him. And then there were the Rocco boys. Remember, Eddie? I got in the car and drove off fast, pretending I was you. And you went out the back way. Then there was the gamblin' ship in the Mexican Gulf. Well, I almost made it until you came along. Johnny: I'll bet you think he's loaded, don't you? I did think so. Guys like Eddie don't fall in love. They're in love with their own hide. He only wanted you because he wanted to get out of doin' what I told him he had to do. He couldn't quit alone. He couldn't do anything alone. Angela found that out. She was just a dumb hoofer in the dime circuit. Thought she was going into the big time. She wasn't married a couple of months before she found out, like you're finding out now. She wasn't as lucky as you are. - Lucky? - Johnny: Sure. She couldn't quit, She found out too much. Names, dates, places, people. The kind of a guy Eddie really is. The work I was doin' for him. The rough stuff. Johnny the strong-arm boy. With the loose mouth. You were the one who told her. You told me I could trust her. She was your wife, wasn't she? Just like I trust this kid here, or shouldn't I? I don't think I wanna hear any more. You'll listen until I'm finished. Angela was just a nice, normal dame. She couldn't take it any more than you take it now. Stuck in her throat. So, she got in her car and started for Los Angeles. she knew too much for us to let her. We got in the big car and started after her. On the bridge outside of Chuckawalla we caught up to her. It was your fault. You made me do it. Sure, I made you do everything. You couldn't even tie your own shoelaces. I'll draw you a picture. When we caught up to her, she wouldn't stop. Eddie went all to pieces. He wanted to let her go. I told him to make her stop, to force her off the road. He lost his nerve. So then I really told him. I said, "Turn that wheel!" And then? He turned it. I didn't kill her. I was only trying to stop her. It was his idea. You heard him say it. - I heard him. - I didn't kill her. - It wasn't me. No. He did it. - Yes, it was. But, you stayed with him anyway. - I had to. - Nobody has to do anything. - You don't understand. - It's you who doesn't. You don't even see it, that's why it's so horrible. This is it for me, Eddie. This is where I get off. - No, it isn't. - It's no good. - It never happened. - Yes, it did happen. No, I never really saw you before as you really are. Yeah, it's funny, ain't it? People think they're seeing Eddie, and all these years they've been really seein' me. I'm Eddie Bendix. Why is it women never fall in love with me? Stay here. I should have figured this. That's what's been eating you all these years. Johnny: By the time she knew enough to get out, she knew too much for us to let her. We got in the big car and started after her. Eddie had never been able to pay the piper. I've always paid for him. Angela was just a nice, normal dame. She couldn't take it anymore than you can take it now. She couldn't quit. She found out too much... names, dates, places, people. Guys like Eddie don't fall in love. They're in love with their own hide. You told me I could trust her. She was your wife, wasn't she? Just like I trust this kid here... or shouldn't I? Johnny: Eddie went all to pieces. Lost his nerve. Then I really told him... Turn that wheel! This is Hanson, rush an ambulance to the Chuckawalla bridge, and tell Fritzi Haller to get down here. - You alright, Paula? - Yes, yes, I'm alright. Better stay here, Paula. - Hello, Fritzi. - Are you alright? Yes, I'm alright. Proud of yourself? No. What happened before the wreck? Did he leave you? We left each other. Don't you wanna tell me about it? I'd rather not. Alright, baby. You can come and work with me at the Purple Sage. The least I can do is teach you how to earn money. How to keep it once you've got it. And how to pick a phony. No, thanks, Fritzi. I don't think I want it. You still in love with him? There's no Eddie Bendix. There never was. Everything I thought was his was really Johnny's. I had it backwards all the time. He's dead. Might have been me if you hadn't come along. "A long rope," I said. It's almost too long. You'd better come home now, baby. Not now, Fritzi. Please. You won't run away? I won't run away anymore from anything. Tom: I'll bring her home. Goodnight, Tom. Goodnight, baby. Goodnight, mother. Always calls me mother when she wants something. I do. I want you to kiss me. - They never fixed it. - They will, someday. Sometimes things can't be fixed. I don't believe that. Neither do you. - Do you, Paula? - I don't know, Tom. I really don't know. That's all I wanted to hear you say. Nice view from here. You can see Chuckawalla. And the Bar Triangle beyond it. If you want to. I want to. It looks good to me. Depends on where you're sittin'. And who's sittin' with you.
