Up the road in the shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still. Sleeping on his face. And a boy, he was sitting there, watching him. The old man's dreaming about the lions. What do you think? If you don't like that, you don't like ice cream. I really like this one. So what'd you get? Did you dig it? What'd you learn? To not chase a big fish. And that Hemingway was a junkie. My baby brother. Come on kid, you're gonna be okay. Mom? Wake up. Mom, wake up. Please wake up. Please wake up. Mangia, mangia. Here we go. Grab that towel, would ya. Oh, yeah. Don't want to fuck my table up. You're welcome kid. Enjoy. Hey, where's Keith at? Keith's at school. It's the weekend. It's Saturday. It's graduation day. That's today? Yeah, that was today? Fuck. Look, don't worry about it. You're gonna find your own journey. It's cool. All right? You get soup, get strong, that's good. Do you want to hear a story? Is it Hemingway? Not quite. Chapter one. There was this dickhead who came to my house and shat and pissed and crapped in my bed, and on my floors. And while he was doing that, I did my very best to keep that little fucker clean. Me and Nikki's mom fell in love when we were young, very young. She got pregnant. My beautiful little Nikki came along. Five years we tried playing house, happy family, and all that. But, I was too young, man. So I just pack my bag one night. And I was leaving. And Nikki said to me the night before, Daddy, will you take me to the beach tomorrow. And I said of course, darling. Promise. Promise, I promise. My last memory of her. She was sitting on the couch in this little, a little polka dot suit, waiting for her daddy. Any man that does that to a kid, well he ain't no fucking man. Look at that. That now, my boys, is what you call fucking beautiful. Here, this is a treat. Don't go crazy you little bastard. Oh, no, I quit. Caroline's not into that. I haven't heard from Alice at all. I tried calling her. I tried. She won't return my texts. I have heard from Alice in weeks. I don't expect to. It's just what she does. Next guy comes along, she disappears. Listen, I think I can help her. I mean like you guys helped me. You think you can help her? Yeah. Do you think I didn't try to help her all these years? She ain't done until she is done. It's just the way it is. And until then, there's nothing you can do. I'm out. Nice job. Good luck. Thanks, Shep. Adam, honey. Aunt Julie, what are you doing here? I'm so glad you're home. Come in, I need to talk to you about something. Is everything okay? Yeah. Hey mom. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Hey. Hey, I'll be right here if you need me. Thanks man. Alice? Alice. You're trespassing. Alice. I got clean. Shep and Keith, they helped me. I came back to help you. You can't live like this Alice. Please, come with me. You can't be here anymore. Alice, please come with me. I love you. I never loved you. What? How can you say that to me? I was just a story for you. No. Uh huh. No. Did you tell people about me? Tell them what? What are you talking about? I will carry her heart with me, my broken, beautiful soul, my runaway. I see myself in her like a mirror that I'm both afraid to look at, and afraid to look away from. She's damaged. Keep reading. Don't you get it, Alice? I wrote you in here. I wrote about me and us. It's because I loved you. Let me help you. Get out. No. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get the fuck out. I don't want to see you anymore, go away. Get the fuck out. Go on, get out. Get out. Hey, hey Adam. Adam? Adam? Oh no, no, no, no. Here you go. Jesus. Hey dad. Hey. I wanted to stop by and thank you for the bike. You're welcome. Look, I'm gonna go away for a little while. I just got to, I got to figure my life out. Sure, I get that. Cool. I'll see you later, dad. Okay. Hey, Adam. Yeah? Be safe, will you? I will. You should go home. Okay. I will. That was my kid. Yeah? You believe it. Hey buddy. I got a present for you. Space Mountain. This is for you, okay. But you got to promise me that you take pictures, all right. I will. I'll take pictures. You know, you're gonna be a great astronaut someday. I'm gonna see you on TV flying around. Don't be sad, it's gonna be okay. All right. I love you buddy. I love you too. Still got it. See you, Keith. Where the fuck did you get that piece of shit? My dad gave it to me. Be careful on this thing. You realize to keep the rubber down on the ground. I'd hate to lose you.
