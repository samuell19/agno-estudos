AGATHE: Once upon a time, in the hidden heart of France... a handsome young prince... lived in a beautiful castle. PLUMETTE: Poof! Poof! Although he had everything his heart desired... the prince was selfish and unkind. COGSWORTH: Master, it’s time. He taxed the village... to ﬁll his castle with the most beautiful objects. And his parties with the most beautiful people.

As a gift, she offered the prince, a single rose. [LAUGHING] [ALL LAUGH] Repulsed by her haggard appearance... the prince turned the woman away. Hmm. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances. For beauty is found within. When he dismissed her again... the old woman’s outward appearance melted away. [WOMAN GASPS] To reveal... a beautiful enchantress. [WOMAN SCREAMING] The prince begged for forgiveness, but it was too late. For she had seen that there was no love in his heart. Chip! Chip! Oh, my! As punishment... she transformed him into a hideous beast. And placed a powerful spell on the castle... and all who lived there. [THE BEAST ROARING] As days bled into years... the prince and his servants were forgotten by the world. For the enchantress had erased all memory of them... from the minds of the people they loved. But the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose. If he could learn to love another... and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell... the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed... he fell into despair and lost all hope. For who could ever learn to love a beast?

Where did you get an idea like that? I don’t know. People talk. This is a small village, you know. Small minded as well. But small also means safe. Even back in Paris, I knew a girl like you, who was so... ahead of her time. So different. People mocked her. Until the day they all found themselves imitating her. Please, just tell me one more thing about her. Your mother was... fearless. Fearless. [EXCLAIMS] So... what can I bring you from the market? A rose. Like the one in the painting. You ask for that every year! And every year you bring it. Then I shall bring you another. You have my word. - Goodbye, Papa. - Goodbye, Belle. - Come on, Philippe. - [PHILIPPE WHINNIES] You know the way. I’ll see you tomorrow! Right. Tomorrow, with the rose. [CHUCKLES] Stay safe.

Me, neither. GASTON: Belle! I heard you had trouble with the Headmaster. He never liked me either. Can I give you a little advice about the villagers though? They’re never going to trust the kind of change you’re trying to bring. All I wanted was to teach a child to read. The only children you should concern yourself with... are your own. I’m... not ready to have children. Maybe you haven’t met the right man. It’s a small village, Gaston. I’ve met them all. Well, maybe you should take another look. Some of us have changed. Gaston... we could never make each other happy. No one can change that much. Oh, Belle. Do you know what happens to spinsters in this village after their fathers die? AGATHE: Coins? Got any spare coins? They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe. This is our world, Belle. For simple folk like us, it doesn’t get any better. I might be a farm girl.

[WIND BLOWING] [PHILIPPE WHINNIES] LUMIÈRE: Look, Cogsworth. A beautiful girl! COGSWORTH: Yes! I can see it’s a girl. I lost my hands, not my eyes. But what if she is the one? The one who’ll break the spell? Who said that? Who’s there? [MAURICE COUGHS DISTANTLY] Uh-Oh. [MAURICE CONTINUES COUGHING] Papa? Papa, is that you? Belle! How did you find me? Your hands are ice. We need to get you home. Belle, you must leave here at once! This castle is alive! Now go, before he finds you! Who? [THE BEAST GROWLING] Who’s there? Who are you? THE BEAST: Who are you? I’ve come for my father. Your father is a thief. Liar! He stole a rose. I asked for the rose. Punish me, not him. NO! He means forever. Apparently, that’s what happens around here when you pick a flower. A life sentence for a rose? [ROARING] I received eternal damnation for one. I’m merely locking him away. Now, do you still wish to take your father’s place? Come into the light. [GASPS] Choose. Belle, I won’t let you do this. I lost your mother. I won’t lose you, too. Now, go. Go! [COUGHS] All right, Papa. I’ll leave. I need a minute alone with him. [GRUNTS] Are you so cold-hearted... you won’t allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? Forever can spare a minute. When this door closes, it will not Open again. I should have been with you. Oh, no, no. Belle, listen to me. It’s all right. Now go. Live your life. And forget me. Forget you? Everything I am is because of you. I love you, Belle. Don’t be afraid. I love you too, Papa. I’m not afraid. And I will escape. I promise. What? You took his place. He’s my father. He’s a fool. And so are you. Belle... Papa! - [GROANING] - Don’t hurt him! - Papa! - MAURICE: No! I’ll come back! I promise! [GRUNTS] [GASPS] LUMIÈRE: Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle... but I have come to escort you to your room. My room? - But I thought... - LUMIÈRE: Oh, what? That “Once this door closes it will not open again”? [IMITATES ROAR] I know. He gets so dramatic. - HeIIo. - [GASPS] [GRUNTS] - Ooh! - [SHRIEKS] Oh, you are very strong. This is a great quality. What are you? I am Lumière! And you can talk? COGSWORTH: Well, of course he can talk. It’s all he ever does. Now, Lumière, as head of the household... I demand that you put her back in her cell at once. What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth? A man, or a mantle clock? Ready, miss? - Trust me. - COGSWORTH: Oh... LUMIÈRE: You must forgive first impressions. I hope you are not too startled. BELLE: Why would I be startled? I’m talking to a candle. Candelabra, please. Enormous difference. But consider me at your service. The castle is your home now... so feel free to go anywhere you like. Except the west wing. Which we do not have. Why? What’s in the west wing? - Oh, nothing. - COGSWORTH: Nothing. - Storage space. - COGSWORTH: Storage space. - That’s it. - COGSWORTH: That’s it. Yes, that’s it. COGSWORTH: This way, please. To the east wing. LUMIÈRE: Or as I like to call it, the only wing. [LAUGHS] Watch your step, s’il vous plaît! [BOTH EXCLAIM] Welcome to your new home. It’s modest, but comfortable. It’s beautiful. LUMIÈRE: But of course! Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle. [COUGHS] Oh, dear. We were not expecting guests. PLUMETTE: Enchantée, mademoiselle. Don’t worry. I’ll have this place spotless in no time. This plan of yours is dangerous. I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette. No, my love. I’ve been burned by you before. We must be strong. How can I be strong when you make me so weak? [COUGHS] [SNORING] Is everything here alive? Hello. What’s your name? - [BOTH LAUGH] - That is a hairbrush. [HIGH PITCH VOCALIZATION] Do not be alarmed. This is just your wardrobe. Meet Madame De Garderobe. A great singer. When she can stay awake. Cogsworth! A diva needs her beauty rest. [YAWNS] Stay with us, Madame. We have someone for you to dress! [GASPS] Finally... a woman. Pretty eyes. Proud face. Perfect canvas. Yes! I will find you something worthy of a princess. Oh, I’m not a princess. Nonsense! Now, let’s see what I’ve got in my drawers. - [GASPS] - Oh! How embarrassing. Froufrou, come help Mama. [BARKING] [GASPS] [EXCLAIMS IN SPANISH] Subtle. Understated. I love it!

Slow down before you break your handle. - Heads up, Mrs. Potts. - Oh. [GRUNTS] THE BEAST: Lumière! - COGSWORTH: Oh! - Be calm. Let me do the talking. You’re making her dinner! Well, we thought you might appreciate the company. Master, I just want to assure you... that I had no part in this hopeless plan. Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her... a suite in the east wing! You gave her a bedroom? No, no, no. He gave her a bedroom. This is true. But if this girl is the one who can break the spell... then maybe you could start by using dinner to charm her. - Good thinking, Cogsworth. - What? That’s the most ridiculous idea... I’ve ever heard. Charm the prisoner! But you must try, Master. With every passing day... we become less human. She’s the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her? Oh, you can’t judge people... by who their father is, now can you? You’ll join me for dinner. That’s not a request. Gently, Master. The girl lost her father... and her freedom in one day. Yes, the poor thing is probably in there, scared to death. MRS. POTTS: Exactly. Just a minute. You see? There she is. Now, remember, be gentle. - Kind! - Charming! Sweet! And when she opens the door, give her a dashing, debonair smile. Come, come. Show me the smile. - Oh, mon dieu! - Oh, no. Will you join me for dinner? You’ve taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me? Are you insane? - [GRUNTING] - Uh-oh. He’s losing it. Oh, dear! I told you to join me for dinner. And I told you no. Ooh! What time is it? What’s happening? I’d starve before I ever ate with you. Well, be my guest. Go ahead and starve. If she doesn’t eat with me... then she doesn’t eat at all. Idiots! You can’t talk to us like that. I forbid it. Uh... Oh. Am I too late? Shame, I was really going to tell him off this time. Oh, Master, you’ve returned. - [EXCLAIMS] - [LAUGHS] - Oh, very funny. - I got you there. Show me the girl. [RUMBLING] Another petal fell. Lumière... I grew three more feathers. And I just plucked yesterday. I know, darling. [EXCLAIMS] I’m getting more metallic every day. Oh, no. It’s happening again. Pardon me. Oh, everyone, calm yourselves. - We still have time. - Mama... am I ever going to be a boy again? Oh, yes, Chip. You’ll have your days... in the sun again. You just leave it to me. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I told you to go away. Don’t worry, dear. It’s only Mrs. Potts. Oh! Oh, aren’t you a vision! How lovely... to make your acquaintance. It’s a very long journey. Let me fix you up... before you go. I have found... that most troubles seem less troubling... after a bracing cup of tea. Slowly now, Chip. [CHIP GIGGLES] Pleased to meet you. Wanna see me do a trick? Chip! That was a very brave thing you did for your father, dearie. Yes. We all think so. I’m worried about him. He’s never been on his own. Cheer up, my poppet. Things will turn out in the end. You’ll feel a lot better... after dinner. But he said, “If she doesn’t eat with me, then she doesn’t eat at all.” Mmm, people say a lot of things in anger. It is our choice whether or not to listen. You coming, poppet? Go! They are coming. Final Checks, everyone! Tout de suite! No, you don’t! If the master finds out you violated his orders and fed her he will blame me! Yes, I will make sure of it. But did you see her stand up to him? l am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again... and how can they fall in love if she stays in her room? Hey, Chapeau, you missed a spot. You know she’ll never love him. A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami... but this is not one of those times. Stand up straight! It’s time to sparkle! Mmm! I have no taste buds, but I can tell this is exquisite. Off! Off me while I work! Pepper, get cracking! Salt, shake a leg! Not so loud! Keep it down. Of course, of course! But what is dinner... without a little music? Music? Maestro Cadenza, are you ready? [MAESTRO CADENZA CHUCKLES] It has been so long since I have performed. I can barely even remember how. [PLAYS CHORDS AND STOPS ABRUPTLY] - Ah! - Ooh! Another cavity. Maestro, your wife is upstairs... finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She’s counting on you to help us break this curse. Then I shall play through the dental pain. Maestro, play quietly, please. Oh, quietly. Sotto voce! Of course! Are there any other tasteless demands... you wish to make upon my artistry? No, that’s it. MRS. POTTS: There you are, dear.

You have to stand. [THE BEAST BREATHING HEAVILY] [WOLVES HOWLING] MAURICE: No! I’m sure this is the way. Do you hear those wolves? That means we’re getting very close to the castle. Look, enough is enough. We have to turn back. Stop! That’s it! There it is! That’s the tree! I’m sure of it. It was downed by lightning at the time. But now... it’s resumed an upright position... through some sort of... magic or other. You really wanna marry into this family? So, that means... that the castle is that... No. No, it’s... [WHISTLES AND BLOWS RASPBERRY] That way. Definitely, that way. I am done playing this game of yours. Where is Belle? The beast took her and she... There are no such things as beasts. Or talking teacups. Or magic! But there are wolves, frostbite, and starvation. Deep breaths, Gaston. Deep breaths. [BREATHES DEEPLY] So, why don’t we just turn around? Go back to Villeneuve. I’m sure Belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner. If you think I’ve made all this up... then why did you offer to help? Because I want to marry your daughter! Now, let’s go home. Belle is not at home. She is with the... You say beast one more time... I will feed you to the wolves! Gaston! Stop it! Breathe! Think happy thoughts. Go back to the war. Blood. Explosions. Countless widows. - Widows. - Yes. Yes. - [EXHALES] - That’s it. That’s it. [CHUCKLES] Maurice! Please, forgive me, old bean. That’s no way to talk to my future father-in-law... now is it? Future father-in-law? Yeah! You will never marry my daughter. [GRUNTS] I saw that coming. If Maurice won’t give me his blessing... then he is in my way. Once the wolves are finished with him... Belle will have no one to take care of her but me. For the sake of exhausting all of our options... do we maybe wanna consider a slightly less... gruesome alternative? Are you coming? Yah! [WOLVES HOWLING IN DISTANCE] [THE BEAST GROWLING IN PAIN] That hurts! If you held still, it wouldn’t hurt as much. Well, if you hadn’t run away, none of this would have happened. Well, if you hadn’t frightened me, I wouldn’t have run away. Well, you shouldn’t have been in the west wing. Well, you should learn to control your temper! [GRUNTS] Try to get some rest. Thank you, miss. We are eternally grateful. Why do you care about him so much? We’ve looked after him all his life. But he’s cursed you somehow. Why? You did nothing! You’re quite right there, dear. You see, when the master lost his mother... and his cruel father took that sweet, innocent lad... and twisted him up to be just like him... we did nothing. LUMIÈRE: Let him sleep.

BELLE: “Love can transpose to form and dignity. “Love looks not with the eyes “but with the mind and therefore...” “And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.” You know Shakespeare? [GRUNTS] I had an expensive education. Actually, Romeo and Juliet’s my favorite play. [GROANS] Why is that not a surprise? I’m sorry? Well, all that heartache and pining and... [RETCHING] So many better things to read. Like what? Well, there are a couple of... things in here you could start with. [GASPS SOFTLY] Are you all right? It’s wonderful! Yes. I suppose it is. Well, if you like it so much, then it’s yours. Have you really read every one of these books? What? [SCOFFS] Well, not all of them. Some of them are in Greek. Was that a joke? Are you making jokes now? Maybe.

Well, I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves. [LAUGHS] [ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] BELLE: They know how to have a good time. Yes. But when I enter the room, laughter dies. Me too. The villagers say that I’m a funny girl... but I’m not sure they mean it as a compliment. I’m sorry. Your village sounds terrible. [SIGHS] Almost as lonely as your castle. What do you say we run away? Another little gift from the enchantress. A book that truly allows you to escape. [BLOWS] How amazing! It was her cruelest trick of all. It was just another curse. The outside world has no place for a creature like me... but it can for you. Think of the one place you’ve always wanted to see. Now find it in your mind’s eye. Then feel it in your heart. Where did you take us? Paris. Oh, I love Paris. What would you like to see first? Notre Dame... The Champs-Élysées... No? Too touristy? It’s so much smaller than I imagined.

[INDISTINCT SHOUTING] BELLE’S MOTHER: Quickly... before it takes her too. [BABY BELLE CRYING] I’m sorry I ever called your father a thief. [WHISPERS] Let’s go home. LEFOU: This is some storm, huh? At least we’re not tied to a tree in the middle of nowhere... surrounded by bloodthirsty wolves. You know it’s not too late. We could always turn back... It’s just... every time I close my eyes... I picture Maurice stranded alone. And then when I open them... he’s... Maurice! [THUNDER RUMBLES] Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice? [ALL MURMURING] Maurice! Thank heavens! I’ve spent the last five days... - trying to find you. - You tried to kill me. You left me to the wolves. GASTON: Wolves? It’s one thing to rave about your delusions. It’s another to accuse me of attempted murder. JEAN: Maurice... do you have any proof of what you’re saying? Ask Agathe. She rescued me. GASTON: [LAUGHING] Agathe! You’d hang your accusations on the testimony... of a filthy hag? No offense, Agathe. Monsieur LeFou. He was there. He saw it all. Me? You’re right. Don’t take my word for it. LeFou... my dearest companion... did I... your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot... try to kill the father of the only woman I’ve ever loved? Well, it’s a complicated question on a number of accounts... [GASPS] But no. - No, he did not. - [PEOPLE MURMURING] You... - [GRUNTS] - [PEOPLE GASP] [MAURICE GROANS] Maurice... it pains me to say this, but you’ve become a danger to yourself and others. No wonder Belle ran away. You need help, sir. A place to heal your troubled mind. Everything’s going to be fine. Just fine. THE BEAST: Well, I saw her in the ballroom... and said, “You’re making everything look so beautiful. “We should have a dance tonight.” I never imagined she’d actually say yes. What was I thinking? LUMIÈRE: No, Master. It’s perfect. The rose has only four petals left which means tonight... you can tell her how you feel. I feel like a fool. She will never love me. Do not be discouraged. [SPITS] She is the one. I wish you’d stop saying that! [SIGHS] There is no “one.” You care for her, don’t you? Well, then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight. Yes, and when the moment’s just right... - [GIGGLES] - Well, how will I know? You will feel slightly nauseous. Don’t worry, Master. You’ll do fine. MRS. POTTS: Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel. Because if you don’t... I promise you’ll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your days! - In the dark. - Covered in dust. - Dark and very, very dusty. - [DINGS] Start with the hair. Women love nice hair! I’ll take the fingers and toes. Chapeau, brush those teeth. They need it. LUMIÈRE: Dip, dip. Snip, snip. Polish the nails. Shine the horns. PLUMETTE: Eyes closed. Poof, poof.

You think you could be happy here? Can anybody be happy if they aren’t free? My father taught me to dance. I used to step on his toes a lot. You must miss him. Very much. Would you like to see him? I’d like to see my father. [INAUDIBLE] Papa! What are they doing to him? He’s in trouble! Then you must go to him. What did you say? You must go to him. No time to waste.

Because he loves her. Then why are we not human? Because she doesn’t love him. And now, it’s too late. But she might still come back. No. I set her free.

He’s been raving about a beast... in a castle! I’ve just come from the castle and there is a beast! You’d say anything to set him free. Your word is hardly proof. You want proof? Show me the Beast! [ALL GASPING] [ALL MURMURING] There’s your proof. This is sorcery! Look at this beast! - Look at his fangs! - [ALL EXCLAIM] His claws! No. Don’t be afraid. He’s gentle and kind.
