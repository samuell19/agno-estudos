Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Son of a bitch! We have a warrant, open up! Come on, get it open! Special Armed Division, we have a warrant. All right, move in. Upstairs. Here, check every shelf and drawer. - Yes, sir. - Go ahead. Put that down and clear the room. Now we're good down here. Governor. Would you like some coffee? There he is, there he is, there he is! Governor, I have some questions. You're a criminal, Governor! How do get to be the governor if you're a liar? Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Morning. Governor Sandro Correa was taken into custody today amid allegations of embezzling significant funds from the public health service. Under investigation as part of Operation Lymphoma, the governor's press office had this to say. Okay, sweetheart. Bedtime. - Dad? - Yeah, sweetie? Dad, have you seen my iPod? - This one? - Uh-huh. I'll put it over here, okay? Now it's time to go to sleep. Dad, is it really true? - Is what true? - That you arrested the bad guy that they showed on the news? I knew it. You should sleep. Goodnight, Daddy. Goodnight, sweetie, I love you. Love you more. What do you have to say about the misappropriation of public funds from your office? I won't say anything without my lawyer. More than two billion dollars diverted from public healthcare and you have nothing to say about it? There's nothing to say about it. There's no problem with the state's financial accountability. And what about the hospital shortages? How do you explain that? Lack of beds, drugs, doctors. That's just incompetence? It is incompetence. From my predecessor. Do you know how much spending deficit I inherited from the previous office? What I wanna know is how you can put your head on the pillow at night knowing that all that money in your pocket was taken from someone dying in the hospital. Well, this conversation was certainly diverting, but given that today's Friday, my schedule's quite full. I don't have time for rumors and hearsay. I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation here. You're under arrest for interfering with the investigations of Operation Lymphoma. You know, I'd go ahead and cancel all those appoints you have today. Because once the public hears this, you're done. We have to put a lid on this thing before it does anymore damage. Find the fucking snitches who blabbed and make sure they say quiet this time. Understood? Bribe the Federal Superior Court, pay whoever you have to pay and bury the rest. Lawyer's demanding to see him. Good morning, officers. Come on, Edu. I held him off as long as I could. I appreciate that. But we're getting nothing out of him. He's too much of a politician to give the game away. There's nothing that could be done right now. Get some rest, okay? We can't let him get away with it again. No. Not this time. Oh, and make sure Louis prepares the boat. Some friends are spending the weekend in Angra dos Reis. It's important. I made a note. Didn't I tell you not to use my headphones? - But the quality is better on yours. - I see. Dad, does this bread have gluten in it? What? You know I don't eat gluten anymore. - You don't eat gluten? - No. Guess that means you don't eat meat. Hey, give it back! I'll eat it for you. All right, your mom's here. Go get your things. - Hi. - Hey. - Come in. - Thanks. I appreciate you taking care of her tonight. She's my daughter too. - Mommy! - Hey there, sweetie. - Uh, Miguel. - Yeah? Before it slips my mind. I wanted to talk to you about going to the match. It's no problem, we'll just watch it here on TV. - Won't we, honey? - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Dad's TV isn't the best. I have to squint. I think it will be much better to see it together in person. All right then, fine, go. See the match at the fucking stadium. You can't say that, there's a kid in this house. Yeah, looks like we're going to the stadium! - Woo! - Yay! Yeah! I have to say, I wish all my meetings overlooked this kind of vista. Antero Gomes. Minister. Thank you for fitting me into your schedule. Oh, that's not a problem. I know you're not the type to waste the time of others - without a good reason. - Of course not. By any chance, did you happen to see that dreadful business on the news yesterday? Let's cut to the part where you tell me what you need from me. Mmm. It's good. Your wife and children have arrived safe in Miami. I'm not worried about them. My children are too young to remember all this shit. People won't even remember a fucking thing after six months. He knows it wasn't me, right? We've already made the request. When I get out of here, there's gonna be a witch hunt. Good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I want to congratulate you all on the governor's smooth arrest. - Yes! - Here we go! While the governor awaits relocation to the penitentiary, we have been tasked with handling a repossession case - until further notice. - That's bullshit. It's not bullshit, okay, Miguel? This could all get really messy, really fast. We've spent months investigating this asshole. And the minute we arrest him, we're reassigned to this low level shit? If anyone has objections or problems accepting their orders, they can see me in my office. As I was saying, the building had its power and water shut off after the mayor's election. Expect poor conditions. All right, there's the last 10 residents. Sorry, sir, but you can't take that with you. Take your possessions and board the bus. Keep it moving single file. What the fuck are we even doing here? Don't you have a match to go to? You better get moving or you'll miss it. Long fucking way away. Don't worry, I'll finish up here. We gotta go, let's go. Thanks, man. The Round Ears going wild as the day's match shapes up to be the defining one of the season. Oh, your hair. Mom, if he isn't here soon, we're gonna miss kickoff. He'll be here, don't worry. Take a look, there he is. - About time. - Hey, sorry I'm late. Hey. - What took you? - I'm so sorry. I got a little present for you. My own Brazil jersey! - Look at that. - Look at the back. - It's my name, Mommy. - Put it on. Okay. - I'll take a photo. - Lift your arm. Okay. You look beautiful. Here. - Okay, okay, okay. - Come on, big smiles. One, two, three, and... - Oh, beautiful. - Okay, give Mom a kiss. We're late. - Bye, Mommy. - Bye, honey. - Bye, bye. - I love you. - I love you too. - Let's go. Are w taking a taxi? - Taxi! - Yeah! You know what. We're gonna miss the match if we wait for this traffic. We'll get out here. Here. - You got it. - Thanks a lot, man. Stay with me. Okay. Don't worry, it'll be all right. - We'll be on time. - It's okay. Alice? Alice! Alice! Talk to me, sweetie. Please. Please, talk to me, baby. I need some fucking help over here! I need help. My daughter was shot and she isn't responding. Bring the gurney! Okay? - All right. - Please be gentle with her. Let's get her into surgery. Alice, just hang in there, okay? Okay? Look, I'm sorry, but you have to stay here. Where's the fucking doctor? You said you were going to take her into surgery. I'm really sorry. Miguel! Miguel! Where is she? Tell me, Miguel. Tell me! Oh no. No. Where is she? I wanna see Alice, where have they taken her? Where is my daughter? Give me back my daughter! Miguel, just give her back to me! - Governor! - Governor! I just have a question! I tried everything I could think of but there's no way of telling exactly where the shot came from. The bullet didn't give us a clue. It could've come from anywhere or from anyone on that street. I swear, if there was anything I could do to catch the bastard, I would do it. She just wanted to see the game. I'm so sorry. It wasn't the bullet that killed her. She wasn't even treated. She bled to death waiting in the hallway, Edu. You need to take care of yourself now. Take some time off and talk to someone and you'll get through this. I promise. Yeah! Thank you for coming, my friends. I'm here to make a public statement regarding the recent incident. I have nothing to fear. Or to hide. Public health is and has always been on of my top priorities. Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Despite the setbacks and allegations, I made a commitment to my state and no matter what, I'm going to make good on that. And I tell you, that I will be the next president of this fine country of ours. We are here in the seat of the state government, where Governor Sandro Correa celebrates his release from police custody and has just made a shocking declaration that he will run for president of the Republic. The governor also made claims that the released recordings were nothing but an attempt at political defamation, denying them wholeheartedly. He also went on record reaffirming that public health... Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! - Fuck you, we fucking know! - Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Sandro Correa! Go fuck yourself, pigs! Sandro Correa! Lock away the traitor! Yeah! Yeah! Get off me, you son of a bitch! This way, Governor. Get your hands off me! Guards, in here! Guards! Let me go! Someone's paying you to do this, yeah? I'll double it. I'll triple it. Get off me! The image is way too grainy. You can't ID anyone. Upscale it as much as you can and keep me posted. Sure, no problem. The military police are here. I'll let the chief know. Pular? I'm gonna start signing papers. Can you start lining them up? - Sure thing. - Thank you. All right, start making your way in. Up against the wall, come on. Against the wall. Cellphone. Name? - Cellphone. - Name. Cellphone. Cellphone. Cellphone. Doze on your own time. Phone in the bag. Cellphone. It's good to see you, man. How're you doing? I'm doing all right. Taking it one day at a time. Welcome back. Attention, everyone. The MP's have given us the protestors but we're no closer to IDing the masked vigilante, so let's get to work and see this through. I need you to give me a list of suspects to present by the end of the week. Start with the vandals in there. They're staying in custody until further notice. Interrogate everyone, no exceptions. Come on, Pular. Let me take care of it. Miguel, I'm not gonna say no to help from one of my top agents but are you okay? I didn't come back to be a paper weight, Chief. I'll start with the girl. Nina Souza. Degree in computer science, currently working as a shop assistant and suspected of multiple instances of hacktivism. How exactly does someone with a brain like yours get caught up in anti - government protests? The freedom to protest is protected by the constitution. Oh, so you're a lawyer too? They didn't include that in your file. Teresa Maria Sosa, is that your mother? Accountant charged with fraud. - Unjustly charged, you mean? - Oh, please. Oh, what a good cop you are. Open up a file and turn off your brain. Too bad that my mother's situation has nothing to do with me being here. Actually, it does. Criminal behavior is up to three times more likely in individuals who have a close relative with a criminal record. Your people took my cellphone. There's a video on it proving what I'm talking about. Can't discuss business on an empty stomach. From my farm in Mato Grosso. Go buy beef, you bastards. - Go buy what? - Come on, eat, eat. It's good for high blood pressure. Now the question the party must deliberate after all of this is who's going to be the best replacement for Sandro? A candidate to compete with Júlia. I have the support of the church and my electorate will continue to grow after I approve the gay cure. You gotta be kidding me. Everyone knows your rap sheet is longer than Judas's. Antero Gomes. Junior. But he doesn't even have an electorate. What he doesn't have is a criminal record. Like you, you, you, or you. I think we should all just take our time and think carefully now. Oh, you'll have a lot of time to think. In jail. Gentlemen, may I remind you of the strings I'm pulling with Marta Regina and the Supreme Federal Court to put an end to this Operation Lymphoma and save all of your sorry asses? I can't believe our destiny is rested in the hands of that lesbian. I thought our destinies rested in the hands of God, Pastor. The only proof you say you have is in my possession. - It won't help you. - Have you heard of backups and the cloud? This is my password. Go on, check out the video. I think you're gonna like it. But to run a candidacy with a relative unknown, you're gonna need serious amounts of investment, capital... I imagine you know that is not going to be a problem for me. Well, the more that I think about it, it really sounds like a great idea. - Anterinho is the face of innovation. - So be it. - All right. - Hey. - A toast. - A toast to Anterinho. Bring us nothing but good. Our families will never be safe until we reduce the number of police on the streets. - Increase the number. - Increase, increase. No, no, you can't cross your arms like that under any circumstances. It sends the message that you're unreceptive. Keep your arms by your side, always relaxed. And hold yourself straight. Stand upright and from the top. Our families won't be safe until we increase the number of police on the streets. Very good, it imparts credibility. Go on. I'm talking to you, the law-abiding citizen. - Chest out. Get your chest out. - Chest out. - Yes. - With an important message. Which is? I don't remember that bit. Anterinho, it's great. - We did it? - Great. Hey, Miguel, find anything interesting? Not a thing, just a bunch of dead ends. All right, let's wait and see what the chief has to say on this. Where is she? I released her. Come on, we're after a masked vigilante here. Not some post - graduate shop girl. That is not how things work, man. Oh, look at that. You're only seven hours late. What if I said I was arrested and spent all night in a jail cell? What if I said you're entitled to a phone call? What if I told you that's only in the movies? I'd tell you that the next time you decide to get locked up, I'll deduct it from your paycheck. Oh, and by the way, Nina. Yeah? Fermetti is fucking awesome. The Italians have a lot to teach us. When you put it back, make sure it's on the right shelf this time. Okay. Since I was alone all day, you close up shop tonight, all right? Nina? - Nina! - Yeah, uh-huh. Miguel. Miguel, open the door. I know you're in there. Get in. What? Get in the car. - No fucking way. - I just wanna talk, all right? Yeah. Just like the talk you had with the governor? I need you to help me. Yeah, there's no way. You'd think one of the country's most wanted hackers would be more careful about what they kept on their phone. Get in the car. Who saw the video? If you're thinking of killing me... I am not going to kill you. Just me. So how did you manage to get Sandro's computer? Oh, that's right. You're with the police. Different rules. Of all the laws you've broken, I'd say that's the most harmless. I need your help, not your attitude. And what do I get out of all this, huh? You get to stay out of jail. I won't implicate myself by helping you... I'm not asking you to cover anything up, kid. I just wanna get the others that were involved in this. The ones who helped Correa embezzle his funds, that's it. To get? Password's encrypted. This might take a while. You got something else going on tonight? Well, it seems that your IT people aren't that stupid. Nothing but family photos. They all in his email? Apparently he was big on sharing. He sent a picture of his cat to the representative Pastor Josias and picture of a bowling ball to the mayor's office. Hang on. What? Son of a bitch. I take back what I said about your IT guy. He chose the wrong career. Fucking hell. It's steganography. Assholes were hiding their data within image information right under everyone's noses. That fucking badass Coelho. - Huh? - Mr. Mayor, I'm heading out. - Need anything before I go? - No, I'm good Claudia but thank you. - Goodnight, sir. - Thanks. The police still have no comment... Mayor Perez was believed to have been thrown out of the window of his fourth floor office... ...in City Hall by some unknown assailant. Yeah, my wife knows I'll be home late. What the fuck? Calm down. You can take the car, I don't... Senator Coelho was at home when an unidentified assailant shot him in his bathroom. He was pronounced dead at the scene. According to our most recent polls, public opinion is split on the series of recent assassinations terrorizing the city. When is someone going to stop this psychopath? He aims only at the upper echlons of national politics. He's been called the Awakener. - The Awakener. - The Awakener. The Awakener. Just one guy! One single guy is somehow making this entire office look like a fucking circus! If we can't stop someone from killing some of the most untouchable people in the country, what kind of message does that send to everyone else, huh? That we can't protect anyone! Or rather, anything goes, because this office is staffed by a bunch of fuck ups! Leon, if you knew a person who was doing something really, really bad, but also knew that those bad things... ...were being doing to some really, really bad people, and it was in your power to do something to stop it from continuing, what would you do? What the hell are you doing here? There's a comic strip. It's missing from my collection and it's proving very difficult to find. I figured that with your experience as a comic strip dealer, you'll be the perfect person to help me find it. God, don't stay comic strip, please. Say comic, comic book, something normal. Is that a yes? I know what happened to you and it's awful. But that still doesn't justify what you're doing out there. Am I supposed to do nothing? No. I just think there are other ways to make a difference in this world. Remember this? I still have it. And if I do help you find this comic book, what difference will it make? This one isn't like the others, it's hard to replace. It's important. And it could be important for you too. Stop staring at the screen, man. You gotta eat something. Thanks. You know, there's one thing I just can't get my head around. What's that? How did the son of a bitch kill five people without leaving a shred evidence? You wanna know what I think? Long range rifle, close quarters combat with tactical insight. The Awakener could be a police officer. You know what I think, it's late. We've been working all day, our minds are shot. - I say we go home and get some rest. - Yeah. You can check out all this stuff tomorrow when we're not dead. Come on. How're you doing? How do you think I'm doing? I don't wanna talk about me. Let's talk about you. You seem different. There's a twinkle in your eye. I landed myself a new freelance job. Stay strong for me. I'll get you out of here. I promise you. Wake up, Nina. You have to start accepting there is nothing we can do about this. This is the building where the meeting's taking place. They'll be eating at the restaurant on the roof. And you expect me to climb that? I thought the DAE was the most skilled unit in the country. This isn't a Mission Impossible movie, kid. - We can contact each other... - I know what it is. Th elevator is next to the service door. The building suppliers load and unload by the third floor basement. From there, you can access the service area and then it's just a matter of taking the elevator - to the restaurant. - And what about security cameras? I'm a fucking hacker. Miguel, I think I know who the Awakener is going after next. Call me back the second you can. Okay, you're clear, stairwell's empty. Is that Antero Gomes outside? So he's the minister's guest. The door on the left leads to the kitchen. That'll lead you straight to the lobby. Okay. She just arrived. Her security guards are staying outside. She came in alone. Hang on. Hide. There's someone coming down the hall. Clear. Right this way, please, ma'am. Oh, thanks. What's this? A company function? - I'll be waiting at the bar. - Right. Excuse me. The prosecutor general of the Republic has in his hands a certain operation that harms all of us. Though, I suppose your excellency already knows that. It would be very much appreciated if you could solve the issue for us. Ah. Would you close that before the whole world sees it? Miguel, the minister's the target. I found an appointment she had off the books. Where the hell are you? The second elevator gets you the closest access. I'll let you know when it arrives downstairs. Miguel, a police car... Wait, what was that? Goddamn it, answer your stupid phone, Miguel. You have to find... Did you get that? Nina, I can't... Miguel! Miguel, can you even hear me? You! Hands up! Fucking hell. Bullet went clean through the shoulder. I can't patch the wound myself. Have you considered going to a hospital? And be arrested? Afraid I'm gonna need you to stitch it up for me. What? Fuck that. It's no different than sewing a shirt. Do I look like I know how to do that? Nina, if I had any other choice, do you think I would have to ask you here? So Antero Gomes has been dictating state policy with his checkbook. It's going to be hard to investigate this guy. I'm not gonna stop now. I think you should get some rest. I was starting to think you were avoiding us. Of course not. So what the fuck happened last night? The security system was hacked. We're looking into it. Sounds like he has something helping him. We can't say for sure but tell them we'll find them. This son of a bitch got too close to us. How did he get in there without being seen? They're saying that the security system was hacked. But whoever did it was pretty good at cleaning up after themselves. So, for now, they're looking into it. I don't pay you to eat, Oliveira. Now wipe your mouth and go find these bastards. Now I wanna make this clear. Embezzlement on this scale requires the complicity of many. Almost 60 percent of the state's public health budget made its way from the hospitals into private pockets. It's all here. Audio, emails, calendars, meeting records, personal notes, and even proof of payment there. Edu, didn't I assign you to take care of that masked motherfucker? Of course, Chief, but that list shows a number of possible suspects. People who stood to gain the most from Sandro Correa's death. Forget Sandro. Excuse me? Sandro only interests us now as the victim of the masked man. The investigation on him, all of Lymphoma, this whole operation... What do you mean, Chief? Minister Marta Regina has closed Lymphoma for lack of evidence. What the hell are you talking about? The evidence is here, I can walk you through the whole thing. Look, this is canceled. The court decides and we obey them. For now, the Lymphoma operation is closed, end of story. You know, I had him right in front of me. It was my fault. If you just had some backup. My bad, man, you know how ex-wives can be. I had to meet Isabela. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - You're up. - No, you go ahead. Seriously? All right. Give me the fucking thing. Public opinion turns on us every time an agent kills a criminal. But have you ever noticed that our very training encourages us to aim for the vital parts of the body? No matter how you slice it, killing's our job. Our job is to uphold the law and protect people. Don't worry, Edu, whatever it takes, we'll get this bastard. Aren't you going to eat, son? I'm not hungry. It's the weight of the presidential sash temping down his appetite if you ask me. It's your loss. This fucking ox, right here, was grazing in the field earlier today. Gentlemen, to the future. The future. Don't you think you're having a bit too much? Leave him be. This is the blood of Christ. Enough with the jokes. This isn't the National Congress where we can sit around all day doing nothing. Shall we get to it? You are the most influential representatives of your respective political parties. All together, you can pass any bill. But if we can manage to secure the presidency of the Republic... I'm afraid I have to excuse myself, everyone. Good night. Please do forgive the boy. Cheers. Cheers. I am not cut out for this. Look at me. Do I look like presidential material? You will be the most popular president this country has ever had. I can't even manage my bank account, how do they... You're drunk, son. No. All I wanted was for you to be proud of me. But the truth is, I'm not prepared for this, it's too much responsibility for me, Dad, okay? Don't you have somewhere else to be at the moment? Listen, son. I know that I've always been very hard on you. And I imagine it's been very difficult for you without your mother around. I understand. Do you know what I'm grateful for in all of this? This whole thing has brought us closer together. I've always been here. Yes. But I haven't. Now it's like I've been given a second chance to make things right between you and me. We can have all the time we want once you're elected. Now, go to bed, son. You've had a long day. Haven't you? Talk to me, son. Talk to me! Antero Gomes Jr., a federal representative and this station's projected presidential front runner for the upcoming election, died of respiratory arrest last night while swimming at his family residence. Why aren't we being allowed to interrogate Antero Gomes? It's standard police procedure. Tell me, Edu, what strikes you as standard about seeing your son murdered right in front of you? All because the people who should've stopped something like that from happening couldn't. Oliveira, I found the address. We traced it to the hacker from the hotel. I'm sending you the details now. I would like to thank you all for the condolences and your kind visitations. But, unfortunately, none of that... will do anything to bring my son back to me. We need to be practical. We have 12 hours to make an official announcement for the candidacy. Right now, the whole country is talking about me. Everyone is moved by the pain of a father's loss. And, besides, I'm the only one who's able to actually finance the costs of your campaigns, your bills and your debts. Can I help you, sir? If you do, this will be a lot less painful. My fellow Brazilians, since the tragic accident that took my son away from me, my eyes have opened to the suffering all round us. Violent self-interest has eroded our lives and change is needed now to make a difference. I will honor the values of my son so that every citizen feels secure and no one else ever need know the pain of losing their child. Leon, I know what you're thinking but I come with an offering that is going to put a smile back on your face. Yeah, I'm on the right track. He just disappeared. I've tried calling and going to his place, but nothing. That's weird. Because he's told me he's met up with you a couple of times now. I honestly thought you two had gotten back together. No. We aren't back together. On the contrary, I don't think we've ever felt further apart than we do now. Miguel is very selfish. He thinks he's the only one suffering. He's convinced no one can understand just what he's going through. But he forgets that he's not the only one who lost a daughter. I think you need to get out of here. And go where? I've got nowhere else to go. Nina, run! Hey, hey, hey. Nice and easy now. The Awakener. Let her go. What did you think? You could kill a son in front of his father and there wouldn't be a price to pay? Here's the deal. Kill Júlia Machado during the debate. She's your target. Do it or your friend dies. Why have you called me here? How did you get this, Edu? Look, what's going on? Miguel's disappeared. He's in trouble. I think the Awakener's actually Miguel. What? As election day draws ever closer, Antero Gomes and Júlia Machado continue to be neck-and-neck in the presidential polls. Today, both candidates will be fielding questions in their first appearance together as part of the RSC debate. Get into position. Stay focused. Testing, testing. Can you hear me? Pissoto, do you copy? Patrol RV, Agent Pissoto, any changed? Nothing new to report, QRU. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to what promises to be an exciting evening as we kick off the first live presidential debate. And our first question of the night. Júlia Machado for Antero Gomes. Thank you. Mr. Gomes... ...my first question... ...late Governor Correa was involved in an embezzlement scandal that saw the public healthcare system massively defunded. Governor Correa and many of his political associates targeted by the Awakener recently, share not only allegations of corruption but also that their biggest campaign contributions came from your company. How do you explain these connections? Good evening, everyone. Good evening, candidate. It's good that you decided to bring this subject up with me tonight. I've been wanting to address that. In fact, I was planning to bring it up myself. The recent political allegations came as a shock to us all and serves only to highlight the need of a national anti-corruption initiative. Just like all the Brazilians who voted for them... Patrol RV, Agent Pissoto, any changes? I was taken in by their promises. I believed their lies. QRV, Agent Pissoto. We have a system of zero accountability and what the Awakener is, is a reflection of the frustration of the people who will no long be deceived or taken advantage of by those responsible for the criminally inadequate operation of our public achievement. The candidate, Júlia Machado, now has 30 seconds to respond. While those were beautiful words, they don't really answer the question I asked. Nothing will end until we stop this capital immunity. Treat politicians as public servants... Any problem, Edu? Nothing. Everything's okay here, I'm just checking on something. It further necessitates the need for... If public administration was affectively handled, there would be no need for privatization. Business and government would be one. I repeat, if public administration was affectively handled, there would be no need for privatization. I know it's hard to understand it but in my government, there would be no need to separate... You can take the mask off, Miguel. I know it's you. You've completely lost your mind. Are you insane? Why did we become cops, Edu? To uphold the law. Fuck that! We didn't join the police to protect these assholes, we joined to protect the people and that's what I've been doing. Think of all the people who died because of their bullshit and tell me they don't deserve the same. What gives you the right? Your hands are just as red as theirs. You can't justify this. Can you really say you've never thought about it, putting an end to these scumbags? The only difference between you and me is I had the courage to do it. Their deaths aren't going to bring back your daughter. And it's not gonna fill that hole she left. And I think you know that, Miguel. A man motivated by profit cannot be fit to lead the nation. If I was self-motivated, I wouldn't be running for this position! I have to do this, Edu. Well I think we both know your son didn't die from cardiac arrest. But was fatally shot by an unknown assailant. This isn't who you are. But the real question for you, Mr. Gomes, is whether your son - was even the real target. - Put it down. You have no right to talk about my son like this! Some people say that the shot was meant for you and that your son died in your place! Don't make me be the one to shoot you, Miguel. ...character and my decisions, but I will not allow you to badmouth... - Everyone, please calm down. - It's outrageous! Oh shit, take us off the air! The identity of the murderer known as the Awakener has finally been revealed. His name is Miguel Montessanti, an agent of the special division of the Civil Police. It's believed his latest target was Senator Júlia Machado, which calls into question Machado's involvement in cases of political corruption, as well as other recent targets of the Awakener. According to recent polls in the presidential election, Senator Machado has suffered a severe drop in popularity as a result. Antero Gomes currently leads in the polls with almost five points over his opponent. Teresa! Visiting hour is over. Come on. Hope you know this is against standard protocol. I don't think they have protocols for this situation. Thank you. I needed this. Miguel. Look at me. Look at me. Why? Huh? Tell me, Miguel. I don't know you. She doesn't deserve this. What would she think of you now? I never thought I'd say this but I'm glad she's not here to see what her father's become. High voter turnout is perhaps the biggest surprise on this decisive day for the presidential election. The actions of Miguel Montessanti, otherwise known as the Awakener, has lit a fire under the people of the Republic who are take to the polling stations in droves. Júlia Machado currently leads the presidential race by one percent of the tallied votes. But with seven states left to cast their ballots in this unprecedented election, anything can happen. News just in. It's Sunday night and with all states declaring, we can now officially announce the winner of the election and the next president of the Republic. Today, our nation's dream for a better tomorrow has overcome fear. The desire for a fair and honest country that allows its people to hope prevails over the doubt that has ruled our past. Through hard work and a competent administration that we will thrive. We realize that the very first thing we must do together is build a nation that is founded solely on the principles of compassion! Not corruption! I brought you a gift. - There's just you here, yeah? - Uh-huh. Let's get him out of there. I didn't know I was expecting visitors. You're being sentenced. What the fuck do you want from me? Still so arrogant. You working out? Or are you just sucking in your gut to try and look good for all the rest of us? Assaulting a prisoner is against... Did you forget who we are? The police force does whatever the hell it wants to do. That's enough. Miguel, what you were doing wasn't exactly wrong. Some people don't deserve to live. The problem is you chose to fight for the wrong side in all of this. Miguel, corruption is a cog in a system that makes this whole, this whole country move! You can't remove the cog without breaking the whole machine. Let's face it, what good comes from shoving your hand in machinery? Huh? Why don't you tell me how much you're getting from that son of a bitch? Enough to keep the ministry and the machine running nice and smooth. And you, agent, how much do you get paid to clean Siqueira's ass? I'm not an agent, asshole. So that's it? That's all the Awakener's fucking head will get you pathetic assholes? Finish him. I've kept the department clear for too long. Shot in self-defense after killing a fellow agent. What a disappointing end to the Awakener. He only had one request. He wants you to suffer. Daddy, can we go home? Yeah, sweetie, we're going home soon. I arrived from my shift and found it like this. He's gonna go after Antero. Our people are done with paying for the expensive cars and expensive caviars. - Get back. - Oh shit. Lock that fucking door! They think they're safe up there in their paid-for penthouses but they can't hide. We can't take this violence anymore! ...or ignore us! We speak with one voice! You're one persistent motherfucker. Who the hell do you think you are to judge me? To stop irreverent greed and neglect infesting our government! Starting today, the people have spoken! They want justice! Have you been to the Pantanal, kid? Hmm? You see, in the Pantanal, you can observe the behavior of nature's most ruthless predators. The real trick... ...is to know... We will see this through! We will see this through! We will see this through! We will see this through! We will see this through! We will see this through! We will see this through! We will see this through! We will see this through! When this all started, I didn't even care. Maybe because in a way I was actually just like them, the corrupt politicians he killed. The same motherfuckers that were a part of this fucking system that feeds us lies while stealing from our plates. Our country, is it possible not to be corrupt here? A country where everything is business. This fucking bureaucracy. Receipts, licenses, certificates, everything to keep you in line. To keep you feeding the corporate machine. You can play the victim if you want. But in the end, we all go down together. It's a cycle and it's wrong. It's all wrong. That's what Miguel thought, so he took matters into his own hands. He killed the corrupt, killed a lot of them. But for what? There's always somebody else to take their place. It's in people's DNA. But DNA isn't fixed. Nothing is fixed. We can evolve. We must evolve. And when that day arrives, we'll no longer need a revolution. But until then, what are you gonna do?
