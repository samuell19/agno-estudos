Hey, baby. You ain't from around here, are you? Mmm, let me guess. LA. No? Mmm, Phoenix. No? Am I close? Don't act all silent. Vegas. Damn. Vegas. All right, well... I'm off at 1:00 if you wanna get a drink. Hey, we could use that bitch over here too, bro. Fuck off, Bobby. Let me talk to my new friend. Hey, new friend. Why don't you head over there and meet my boys. We're low on bitches. Why are you always fucking starting shit? Get out of here, Jade. I don't want to talk to you. So what's your deal? I was just leaving. Good. Why don't you get the fuck out of here? Otherwise you're gonna start having to pay me fucking double. Why would I do that? Because I fucking run this joint. Do you know who the fuck I am? Bobby? What'd you say, you smart-ass? What'd you say? You fuckers done? Put your hands on the bar. - Put your hands on the bar. - Now. - Now. - Hands. - Bobby, you good? - He broke my nose. - Get in the car. - I want his head. Get in the car. You two, out. Let's go. Move it. You heard him. Hey, asshole, get outta here. You got a name? Wrong answer, stranger. Hi, Dad. I don't know where you're at. I don't know what the hell you're doing. I don't know who else to call anymore. I want to get clean again. Where the fuck are you? Please call me back. I'll talk to you soon. Bye. I... I love you. I really don't appreciate you manhandling my boy like that. I take it kind of personally. So who are you really? Do we gotta go through this again? We don't like strangers in this town. I think you get that. What I don't get is what a guy like you is doing in a place like this. It's a long way from Vegas. Goddamn it, I hate this tough guy shit. Tough guys always think it's best not to talk. I never understood why. He doesn't look so tough to me. He thinks he's tough. I think they'll get you talking. Sorry. Excuse me. I gotta get this. - Maggie? - Ben, where are you? I told you I'd be home soon. You don't care that I made you dinner? - Of course I care. - Do you want it to get cold? - No, I don't want it to get cold. - Okay, I'll see you soon. - I'll see you soon. - Don't drive too fast. I won't. - I love you. - Okay, bye. Love you too. My kid sister. She likes to bake. I gotta run. To be continued. This is all that was on him, Mr. Nichols. Give them a few minutes. Okay, so next time you wanna start trouble in my town, you might want to think about taking the next exit. Whoa, whoa! What the fuck is going on in here? Stop it right now. I am processing him. What the fuck? You tell Nichols that I'm the sheriff around here, and you're not supposed to talk to the prisoner. - We're not. He's fine. - For real. You guys should go. This isn't protocol. - Spare me that shit. Let me do my job. - Hey, hey! I think he got the point, okay? All right. Nice talking to you, fella. You good? You're okay? Catch your breath. I'm sorry about this. This isn't how we do things around here. This goddamn town. Calm down. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna walk me out of here. - Okay? - Okay, okay. You're fucking crazy. Yeah, maybe. - You know who those guys are? - I don't give a shit. Look, you're a good cop. Nothing's going to happen to you if you don't fuck around. I'm just doing my job. They work for Nichols. They're not cops. You know who Nichols is? Yeah. You wanna tell me where he lives? I ain't telling you shit. He's the shogun around here. We'll see about that. - Hey. - Hey. What have you done? - Smells good. - Yes. - So do you. - Thank you. Where's your nephew? I don't know. And I don't know how he's ever gonna take over the family business. - You know we have somewhere to be today. - I do. - We cannot be late. - I will not be late. - Please go talk to your son. - That's where I'm going. Get that goddamn thing out of your mouth. Why are you smoking that shit all the time? I've been trying to call you. - Who is he? - Who's who? This guy. Oh, shit, Dad. Stop. Stop. - How should I know? - What did he say? - He didn't say shit. - Don't you lie to me. Dad, I swear to God I've never seen this guy in my fucking life. Just let him go. Let me handle him. I can take him. Okay, like you handled him last night? We save your sorry, spoiled little ass month after month. You bring this shit to our doorstep. Like we need this right now. Pie is getting cold. Get up. - How is it? - Mmm. Tasty. Very tasty. Bobby? I said, how is it? It's good, Aunt Maggie. It's really good. Good. Family is everything, isn't it? That's right. I want you to tell me why that man in holding has this picture. Look at it. Yeah, it's a real shame. Isn't it, Bobby? Son, I want you to think really hard. I want you to rack that weed-soaked brain of yours and tell me. Who do you think that man could be? Oh, man. Wow. I'm lost. I know. How did you know when it was time to quit? It was ecstasy to me. And I knew I was... I was doomed. So I... I turned around. Hunter, you have to come in. If you can hear me, this isn't the way. You have to come in. Bring the car back. We can talk about this. I gotta find out what happened to my daughter. We can help you. Just come back in. There you are. - Hi, Burt. - Ben, looking good as always. - Thank you. - Not as good as your sister. - Maggie. - Thank you so much. Ben, Maggie, this is Chairman Welmas of the Cabazon nation. They own all of this. Welcome to Fantasy Springs Resort. It's a pleasure to meet you, Chairman. I want you to know that your interests are being protected. Thank you. And I want to introduce you to my best friend, Congressman Mike Ellis. It's a pleasure. - Congressman. - Ben here. My vice president, my head of security. Basically the brains behind my whole operation. Tell 'em what we got, Ben. What we've got here is the biggest aquifer in the Southwest. Under all that sand, just a giant river of water. That's right. This is what a billion dollars looks like on a sunny day. This water deal is what we've been waiting for. We have the tribe on board. We're good to go as soon as we get state approval. Oh, you'll get state approval. We've taken care of that. It's coming in days. A month from now, we're gonna be back here popping champagne. Hey, what's going on? - Nothing. - Yeah, right. I know when my brother is fine and when he's not fine. Plus, that vein in your forehead is popping out. - So tell me what's up. - You always take care of me. - You bet your bottom dollar I do. - Yes, you do. - I take care of it all, don't I? - Yes, you do. Listen, if that motherfucker is in jail and somehow looking for Melissa, we're gonna take care of him too. 'Cause nobody's gonna come between that water deal and us, okay? - Right? - Yes, ma'am. I'll see you inside. You are one ballsy fuck, aren't you? This is my home. Yeah, I know that. I'm here for your son. Dad, what the fuck is going on here? Get back inside now. Where the fuck is my daughter? - Who? - Melissa. That's her bracelet. - Bobby, get back in the house. - We can take this guy. Fucking shoot him. Tell me where she is right now, and I won't drop your old man in front of you. - Get back in the house now. - What do you want me to do? Get back in the house! Bobby? - I didn't... - Bobby, shut the fuck up! Wait. What did you say? - What the fuck did you just say? - I didn't want to do any... Stop talking, Bobby. - We were having fun. - Who was having fun? Say it! Tell me! - You didn't mean what? - I didn't want to hurt her. I'm good. - Mmm. - Ooh! I'm okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that? What is it? - This? - Yeah, yeah. - Bracelet. - Where'd you get it? From no one. Do you want it? Fuck yeah. Can I have it? Yeah. It's yours with my blessing. I love you. Yeah. Oh! She almost spilled my drink! Where the fuck have you been? Jimmy, you found it and then you broke it? That's what you get, Jimmy! That's what you get! Wow. - What do I fucking do? - Why would you bring that? That's a lot. You think that shit's crazy? You think that shit's crazy? You should see what I got in the back. - I didn't want to hurt... - Bobby! Bobby! Bobby? Is he dead? Oh, G... He's out there! Go get that piece of shit! I want his fucking head! I see him. I see him. Go! Go! He's on the move. Move! He's moving! He's moving! Fire! Fire! Fire! He's off! He's running! He's running! In pursuit. Move! Move! Fuck! Fuck! I don't see the motherfucker. Mmm. Steve said they were all out of bear claws, so help yourself. He stole my keys. - Who? - Jake Hunter. He's on his way to Nichols' place. I called CHP. - County. - Bartlett, this is Stone. Get your ass down to Nichols' ranch now. We have a situation. And don't tell Ms. Sheriff where you're going. Hurry up. Okay, yeah, I'll be there in five. I gotta go. Bartlett, do you copy? Go for Bartlett. Hey, looks like this guy has been making his way across state. Over. Fucking give me that. This is Stone. Officer Kim, as opposed to fucking around and playing private detective, why don't you go write some parking tickets? Okay? Copy that? This is under control. They got him. He's around here somewhere, I know it. He won't last long out here. And if you get him in your sights, you kill him. You understand me? - I ain't never killed anybody before. - It's never too late to learn. Brock. Brock. Jesus Christ. I didn't sign up for this, Stone. - Where are you going? - To the station. You're not going anywhere. - This is out of my jurisdiction, man. - Goddamn it, stay here! - No, good luck, man. - Don't be a pussy! Get back here! Stone, come in. This is Sarge One. He's not around here. We don't know where he's at. What do you have for me? - I think we lost this motherfucker. - Meet me at the tree line. We need to send a drone up. No! Don't fucking kill me. Don't fucking kill me. Oh, God. Oh, God. Tell me a reason not to put one in your head right now. Just a fucking cop. Fuck, that hurts. Please stop that. - You work with Kim? - Yes, yes. She's my partner. - I don't believe you. - I'm not a dirty cop. I swear, man. Nichols owns the town, but he doesn't own me. I'm just a fucking cop, okay? That's why I was leaving. Please don't kill me, man. I got a kid. Okay, you go back to Kim. You tell her I'm out here. No one else. I-I won't say anything. - I'll come find you. - Okay, okay. I swear to God. Okay. Fuck. Gotta get the fuck outta here. Fuck, we lost him. Handle this motherfucker. Don't worry about it. We got an eye on him. Fuck! Fuck. Are you hurt? What happened? What's going on? I'm fine, okay. Nichols' ranch. Shit went bad. - He killed Bobby. - Oh, my God. He could've fucking killed me. He let me go. He has a message for you. He wants you to know where he's at. We lost him. It's just too dark out there. We can't see shit. - I know, I know. - We'll have to resume the search tomorrow. Just keep a perimeter. Just two ways out of these fields. Okay. So I was just telling her. You need anything... anything... I'm here. We're family. But I hate to say this. This can't get out. - It won't. - It can't. I know. I mean, I need to know from both of you, friend to friend, is there anything else you're not telling me? - Anything I need to know? - No, Vic. This is my business here. It's on the line. - We're days away from the state funding. - We know that, Vic. If you know that, and you two want your piece, you better clean this shit up. I mean fucking clean. 'Cause kid or no kid, nothing's getting in the way of me making half a billion dollars. Nothing and nobody. You understand? You understand? Christ. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Bobby. I'm sorry about what happened. Fuck. He told you that? Yeah. Why me? I don't know. We need to call in the other counties. This is huge. This is completely insane. Yeah, but then Nichols will hunt us down too. - Yeah, so what are we gonna do? - Keep digging. I'll head out there in the morning. Kim, what if he's playing you? None of this makes sense. Why would he let you go? - I don't know. - And why would he let me go? He said he was looking for his daughter. Yeah, well, I have a feeling Bobby Nichols knows what happened to her. She's haunting us, Mags. That girl wants her revenge. No one's gonna do nothing, okay? We do what we do for family. That man's gonna die and no one's gonna know the difference. We built this business from the ground up, and I will protect that at all costs. Bobby was a fuckup and you know it. Look at this place, man. Do you think that he could have handled this? No. Why? 'Cause it was always gonna be me and you. Come here. Did you fail? Yeah, did I fail you? No, you didn't fail me. I don't doubt the job I'm doing. I doubt my ability to do it. I'd prefer to be at home with Melissa. She misses you. I don't have the answers that you have. I don't have answers. I'm just comfortable with the question. The home I have with my family, I destroyed. There's just so many times you can take something precious like that away before it cripples you. How long you been smoking? None of your business. I mean, I don't remember. You don't need to take care of me. I can go with Mom. Mom's not better. And you are? I'm here. Are you though? You come back after being gone from who-the-fuck-knows-where. And then you're my dad all over again? That's not fair. I'm 18, I have my own life, my own shit going on. You know, like, you don't want to deal with that. - I wanna hear it. - No, you don't. I don't need some in-and-out dad telling me how to live my life when he can barely live his own. Are you gonna take those shades off and actually look me in the eye? You gonna tell me what happened? You know I can't. Well, then guess what. I'm not gonna tell you where I've been. How's that? That's not right. I'm your father. I don't need a father. I need a dad. Okay, let's try it. Stand by. We've reached the property and dropping off the asset now. Sir. Sir. Sir, I'm here to escort you to the property. Right this way. Follow me. - May I help you? - Yes, I hope so. - I'm looking for Ben Nichols. - Okay, and? And you are baking something fantastic. - Is there something you need? - That smells good. Can I come in? We have a lot going on. A really full day. We need to take care of some things. Yeah, I think I can help you with your present situation. Oh, really. What situation is that? The man out in the field. I'm the only one who's gonna be able to bring him in. So why don't you call your brother, Ben, and we'll have some muffins and a little chat. Okay? Smells fantastique. We can get you clean. You just gotta trust this guy. Trust. Right. Like you... Can you... - Can you just take me home? - You can't keep going like this. - I just need some sleep. - Listen, we can get you clean. We'll do it together. It's gonna be hell, but we'll do it together. - You won't be alone. - Okay. - We can do this. - Take me home, okay? Please. Brother. Hey, Jake. God Almighty. Hey. Hey, man. - Thank you for doing this. - How are you? Well, what's on your mind? - What the hell's going on? - You remember Melissa, right? I see. - She grew up a little bit. - Yeah, she did. - Hey. - Hey. You probably don't remember me, do you? Nope. You were a little tiny thing last time I saw you. She's sick now. We gotta get her in somewhere, and I only trust you. I can't handle it, man. This was your world. Yeah, yeah, sure was. Um... Can you do this for me? It's out of my realm. There's not too many things in this life you could ask that I wouldn't do for you. I know. She needs it. She doesn't trust me. - Get her in somewhere? What's going on? - I'm right here. Literally right here. I know. And you trust him like me. More than me. - I don't know him. - He's been through this. Your dad and I been doing things before you were even born. Listen to what he's telling you. He's been clean, what, 30 years now? At least, yeah. And he's helped people get clean. I trust him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it. For what it's worth, I know where you're at, just looking at you. And I've been there before myself. Uh, this ain't no intervention or any of that stuff. 'Cause I don't even believe in that, all right? God bless the people that it helped, but it didn't work for me. And that ain't what I'm gonna... that ain't what I'm thinking of doing. Melissa, take the glasses off. We're trying to help you. Well, there you are. Okay, you guys are good, right? I'll get going. Whatever. He can leave. He does it all the time. Well, first, my condolences. There's nothing worse than a parent losing a child. How did you even know about that? Well... let's cut to the chase. Um, I don't think you have any idea who you've got in that field out there. Well, we can take care of our own. I know your security firm very well. Okay. I know you're aligned with some really deep, deep pockets. And you're in charge of the security arrangements for some pretty important corporations. - Am I right? Right? - Yeah. Yeah. Well... Well, your interests are going to crumble if you let Jake carry this to its inescapable conclusion. He's not gonna stop. He's not gonna stop until you're dead. Or he is. Hmm. He's dead. You know, you and I both know... we don't have the security clearances that we used to. But his level of employment has not changed. Hmm. You got any questions for me? Not just now, thank you very much. - Appreciate the information. - You're welcome. Enjoy your muffin. Wake the fuck up! You piece of shit. We found you like the rat that you are. Sneaking around and stabbing guys in the back like a pussy. Don't tickle him. Make it hurt. I oughta blow your fucking head off, but it'll go too fast. You fucking dirty bastard. You fucking... I'm gonna kill you. Stone, you copy? Call them off. That's not how we do things around here, Deputy Director. Michaels. Michaels. - Bring them in. - Bring them in? That guy deserves a fucking bullet in his fucking head. - No one's bringing him in. - Mags. I'm sick of sitting around having a civilized conversation. Either you kill him, or we're killing him. How is that working out for you? Bartlett, on my way. I'll text you when I get there. Slow down. Slow movements, Hunter. You gave my partner coordinates. Here I am. Why? Stop. This distance is good. If I wanted to kill you, I would've done it back at the station. So then what? You're supposed to be a good cop, right? Yeah, I am. Well, these fucks know what happened to my daughter. Help me take 'em down. - Nichols. - Yeah. So do you think they had something to do with it? His crew runs the whole town. They're covering up some shit. Think about it. You know it's true. You're hurt. Let me help you. I'll live. Her name is Melissa. Check your missing persons. - How will I get ahold of you? - I'll find you. Hunter, let me go. You fucking motherfucker! I'll kill you! - Bobby. - What about Bobby? Nichols' piece-of-shit kid. You hang out with him. He's a nut. He picks up broads, he gets 'em high. - That's what they want to do. - You know these girls? They're junkies. They're pieces of trash. You fucking motherfucker! I'm gonna kill you if I get out of this! Nineteen years old, brunette. Melissa. He said he loved her. Melissa. You fucking know who it was. She was a junkie. You fucking... I didn't kill her! Nichols killed her! I didn't do shit! How you doing? Hey. This is the fucking Manson Family. - What's going on in here? - Hey, how you doing? Where's Bobby? Putting on a clinic. - Get everyone outta here. - Shut the fuck up. Get everyone outta here! All right, guys, that's it. It's a wrap. Let's go. - Hey, Bobby. - Everybody out! Get off, man. Show some manners. - Get off! - Fuck you! Get outta here. - You fucking... - I don't give shit. - She's in there with me. - I don't give a shit. - Get the fuck out. - You heard him, Bobby. Let's go. - Fuck you! Fuck you! - Everybody out! Everybody! All y'all! I didn't fucking do shit. It was Nichols who killed her. She's not fucking dead. You're fucking lying, you cocksucker. She's fucking dead! And I didn't do it! I didn't do it. You gotta let me go, man. Let me go. - Mr. Greenberg. - Great to see you. I can keep this as tight as you like. I know. What happens next? Not sure. I haven't decided yet. But I like to leave those kinds of things to chance. I like chance. Favors the prepared. You know, I warned them. I told them nothing was gonna get in the way of this water deal. What about your guy, this, uh... this Hunter? Hunter's my guy. I'll take care of him. Don't worry. Nothing's gonna get on your skirt, okay? All right. Give my regards to the tribe. Thanks. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Oh. I'm Deputy Kim. - This is the guy they sent in. - Oh. - Who are you with again? - I used to be Jake's boss. Oh. So, uh, you got anything you could share with me? Nothing. I had to go check on my daughter. Ah. Daughters are good. I did call your cell phone, and there was no answer. Shit. I must've left it at home. I hate when that happens. So, does Jake have a sister, a female family member he's close to? Well, we do know that he's tried to reach some members of his family, and we're not quite sure who. And he did leave a text message for his ex-wife. Why? There may be a lead I need to follow up on. It could give us some more answers. How many people know about it? - No one. - Great. Let's keep it that way. - Were you gonna tell me about this lead? - I was going to. - Bill, where's Melissa? - Oh. Hey. Listen, I... I knew you were gonna show up. I can't get her on the phone. Her mother's not picking up. I didn't call you because I figured she was coming back. What do you mean? I left her with you. I thought you had your eyes on her. Yeah, you sure did leave her with me. You left me with a big, heavy load. I tried to help you out, but I ain't no fucking babysitter. And that's what it was turning into. You need a dose of reality. You're running around being a superhero. Big shot. Yeah. And you're good at it. But where were you when she needed you? I should have told you, but I didn't want to make it worse, so... I know where she is. Where? Ever hear of a place called the Salton Sea? Yeah, I know it. What the fuck is she doing out there? She's with some drunken asshole named Bobby. Some fucking piece of shit. And God knows what they're doing over there. I gotta go find her, man. She was trying. So, how many points of entry are there into this area? It's about five square miles of connected fields. And exits? No, it's pretty contained. All farmland. Only a couple access roads in and out. Well, then he's there for a reason, and he's not looking to escape. Uh, me and Bartlett are gonna follow up on something. This is Deputy Kim. This is a restricted channel. They're all dead. Jake, son, you gotta come in. That's not gonna happen. What do you want? Answers. What are you gonna do, son? Wipe out the whole town? - No, just them. - Who's them? Ask Sheriff Kim. Jake, you're hurt. You gotta come in. Don't make me call in the team. Don't do that. You do what you gotta do. Murph, you know who I'm here for. You're gonna wanna know. It's Melissa. Okay. They have Melissa. They killed her. I'm coming back for all of them. You're gonna help me take them down. He's coming in. What? He's bringing the fight to us. Gear up. And under no circumstances do you shoot him. Amigo! What is it? This town is plagued with missing girls. You think Jake Hunter knows something about this? Yeah, I do. I think that's why he's here. And I think his daughter's photo is going up next. White van. Suspects are considered... Be advised, suspect is armed. Copy, westbound headed... Taking the shot! I told you no shooting, goddamn it. We have to move. Now. - You two bring the car around right now. - You got it. - Go! - Okay. You drive. Goddamn it! Three forward! Two left, three right. - Okay, so... - Sh, shh. We're in full pursuit. He's heading into an abandoned church. That's it. Let's go. Head to the church. Where are we going? I don't think this is a good idea. Stop the car. Stop the fucking car! Shit. You gonna make it? - Take me to Nichols. - Okay. How did we get here, Mags? We had it so perfect. There's no such thing as perfect. There's just us. She's out here. I can feel her. No, she is not out here, okay? Let's go back home. Come on. Okay, I'm headed back. Lose the gun. Sit down. It's gonna be okay. No, it isn't gonna be okay. What do you want? I want to hear it from your mouth what happened to my daughter. I don't know who your daughter is. I'll break every one of them. You're a dead man. Do you know about Bobby and Melissa? Do you know about the drugs he gave her? - Do you know that he raped her? - I had no idea. Okay! Fuck! Stop! All I know... All I know is she was causing problems. So now you know who she is. I want to hear how she ended up OD'd and raped in this shithole town. Bobby told me that it was an accident. My son had a drug problem. Your daughter was an addict too. And these kids were partying and it went too far. My daughter is gone. So is my son. No one killed your daughter. It was drugs. She OD'd. That's fucking bullshit. That's not how it happened. It is how it happened! Yeah, go ahead. Fucking do it. Go ahead. Do it. You will never know where her body is, and you'll never find her. That's gonna hold up in court. Deputy Bartlett requesting immediate backup to Nichols Ranch. Immediate backup to Nichols Ranch. Come out with your hands up, now. You let us walk out of here. That's the only chance you have. Fuck. Get the fuck up. Let's go. Get the fuck up. Okay! Jake, don't hurt 'em. Don't hurt 'em. Just bring 'em out. Come on. Move, you motherfuckers. Bring 'em down. All right, you fucker! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Jake, put the gun down. - Put the gun down. - Put your gun down, please! Put the gun down! - Shut the fuck up! - Nichols, put it down. - Do you know what they did to Melissa? - Don't get hurt. Put it down. Do you know what they did to my little girl? Holy shit. She's still fucking breathing, Dad. - We gotta fucking do something. - It's too late. Too late? She's fucking alive! - She's halfway dead. - Halfway dead, my ass. Are you shitting me? What do you want to do? What's the game plan? I want you to be quiet so I can think for one minute. Can you do that? - This isn't my fucking fault. - She's dead because of you, asshole! - Oh, my God. - You sick... She's alive! Let me tell you right now, you fucking asshole! - Look at her! - Can you take it down? You killed her, you motherfucker. - Did you fucking see that? - All right, take him home. - Dad, I'm fucking sorry, okay? - Shut up! Dad, I... Fucking... Just go home, kid. Goddamn kids. - They fucking killed her! - He's lying! They're covering it up, this whole sick fucking family! No one killed your daughter! She died! She died with a needle in her arm, man! I will kill her right in front of you! - You're gonna get yourself killed! - Go get him! Put the gun down. I will do it, Murphy. I'll kill these motherfuckers. Everyone has to know what they did. It's not gonna bring her back, man. Arrest the Nichols. - Put your hands right there. Freeze! - Go, go. Go! - Me? - Yes. On your knees now! - You are under arrest. - Why? You have the right to remain silent. She's hurt her hand. She's... Her hand is broken. Let her walk. Good work. Jesus Christ, you're a fucking mess. Oh, God. You know, help is on its way. All right? You're gonna be good. All right? Thank you. I'm sorry. Life's not fucking fair. Melissa knows. You weren't the bad guy. I'll get a medic. Stay right here. Checking in on you. I don't know where you ended up, but I don't like how we last spoke, man. I know life ain't fair. I know what it's like to lose my family to the job. But you're a good man, and you know that I know that you're a good father. Nothing gets us ready for that mission of being a dad, right? Melissa is a good girl. She don't deserve to be in the mess she's in. But then whoever does? Look, if you find her, just hug her. Tell her everything's gonna be all right. She just wants her dad. You hear me? Listen, don't let her go. This world is a fucking cruel and unforgiving place, and that's why they send men like me and you out there into the dark places. If anyone lays a hand on her and hurts her, then make sure they get what they deserve, every last one of them. She's haunting me, isn't she?
