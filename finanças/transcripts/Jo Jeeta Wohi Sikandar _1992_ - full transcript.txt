Dehradun, a beautiful paradise in the mountains,... is situated far away from the hustle and bustle of humanity. And in this paradise are 12 chosen schools of lndia. The very affluent families of lndia,... send their children here for a good education. Some own steel mills and some, tea estates. Every child is the heir to millions. Rajput School and College is considered to be the best. lt excels in academics and is the best at sports. Similarly, Queens Junior College is the best for girls. The boys from all the colleges are crazy about them. There is a place called Mallroad, is centrally located. Here you find the shops run by the locals. The children of the poor locals have an ordinary school.... Model School and college. The speciality of the boys here is a poor academic record... and a good record for bad behaviour. The exams are fast approaching... but the preparation at Model College is different. lf they have any goal, it is the girls from Queens college. Like every year, the exams are over. There is going to be an lnter College sports competition. The entire colony is busy discussing who will ... be the winner of lnter College cup, this year. Squeeze it a little more. Pass me the spanner. Ratan's cycle is ready? - Just a a while longer. l'll send Ratan over then. - Uncle... have some tea. - No, l don't have the time, Anjali. Give me number 13. Does Ratan have any chances of winning the cycle race? l don't know. But he is the champion of our college. Hurry up. The boys are waiting. - Yes, father. Mr.Shakur, l am but a math teacher at Model College. Ask Mr.Ramlal about the probable winners and losers in sports. He is the coach. Well, Mr.Ramlal, how are the sports preparations getting on? Quite fine, Mr.Dube. - Oh, really! Shakur, you'll take charge for a few days. Yes, sir. - Here's some money for the expenses. Why are you standing idle? Don't you have to train the Model boys? Or...Have you given up the idea of competing? Since the time the Rajput boys won the tournament last year... they seem to be walking on air. The stupid...! Criticism won't help. Our boys will lag behind in every test. That's not true, Mr.Dube. - l am not referring to Ratan... but to your younger son, Sanjay. lf he passes the exams this year, l will distribute sweets. l will do it... And plenty, too! Sanjaylal..l've found mine! Only 2 marks! Change it. - Pass it quickly. Have you found yours? - Hey! l've found mine. Let me have a look. - None of my sums are right. Hurry up. Someone's here! Who is there? Who is there? Thief! Catch him! There he goes. ... catch him! Stop the thief! Hey Mister, stop him! What were they doing? - They were changing results. Yes? - All seems well. Did Ratan tell father anything? - No. lf father would have known, that would be the end of me. Once again l lied to uncle Ramlal to protect Sanju. l don't know why, but l believe that l can do anything for him. l am still unaware of his feelings for me. Ratan, you changed my marks in math again, didn't you? Yes, my dear. l will fail and you will be responsible for it. Be grateful that l did not tell father. Else, you would have been thrown out as you were, my dear. Hey! l don't fear anyone. Besides, why are you patronising me? Do you know what your problem is? - What? You want to achieve success without any hard work. Don't you know what integrity is? - Sure. You are the epitome of integrity. You are Mahatma Gandhi you are Sarojini Naidu. - Hold this. Let me have a look Wow! Father was in great shape. Hey, where did you find this? ln 1965 Model College beat Rajput in the cycle race... for the first and the last time. My friends had brought me home on their shoulders. Neither have l, nor have the rest of our locals forgotten it. The same event will take place tomorrow. All eyes are on you, Ratan. Who are the brave boys? - Rajputs! Who are the leaders? - Rajputs! At the lnter School sports meet in the 100 metres race... Shekhar Malhotra, last year's winner of Rajput College is on the fourth track. Shekhar Malhotra is first, Ratanlal Sharma is second. And Randhir Thapar is third. lt appears that Sanjaylal Sharma has sprained his ankle. What happened? - l sprained my ankle, else... Otherwise you would have come first. What lame excuses! Once again, Shekhar is first, Ratanlal is second position. Chances are that Rajput will take championship once again. Xavier's is leading at 245. Rajput is second at 225. Model is third at 210. A sprain 6 schools are participating in this event. The first baton has changed hands at 100 metres. Rajput College is in the lead and Xavier's is next. The baton has changed hands again at 200 metres. Model is at the second.Whereas Rajput is still in the lead. The third baton has been passed to Shekhar Malhotra... and Ratanlal Sharma is at his best to forge ahead. And...What a wonderful victory by Ratanlal Sharma. And Model School gets 20 additional points. That was wonderful, Mr.Ramlal. The 100m hurdle race has started. And Ratanlal has displayed a miracle once again. But Rajput is still at the same position. According to the score board... the lnter School Championship is entirely dependent... on the marathon cycle race. lt's tough competition between Rajput, Xavier's and Model. Whosoever wins this cycle race... will be deserving of the lnter School championship. And the 50 km marathon cycling has started. The participants will leave the stadium, on uneven terrain... to reach the highest point and return. We will be getting reports from 3 check points along the way. 'We will be successful! Model College' The cyclists have reached here... and they are proceeding at great speed towards Baramulla Hills. l, Rakesh Sharma from Pillar Rock check point... welcome the spectators at the stadium. The cyclists will be here at any moment now. ln first place, is Randhir Thapar from Xavier's College. ln second place is Vinay from Andrew's. ln third place is Shekhar Malhotra from Rajput. ln fourth place is Ratanlal Sharma from Model College. And now the cyclists are approaching the stadium. At first place is Xavier's followed by Lawrence... Andrew's is third and Peter's is fourth. Next is Rajput followed by Model. There will be five laps in the stadium. And Lawrence has taken the lead. Shekhar Malhotra is trying his best. And... he has overtaken Peter's. Ratanlal from Model is just behind him. He has forged ahead of Andrews and has now crossed Lawrence, too... in second place. Shekhar has gone ahead of Xavier's, taken the first place. He missed by a hair's breadth, Mr.Ramlal. He would have defeated Shekhar otherwise. No, Dube l believe in one motto alone... ''He who wins is the conqueror'' Rajput School is not only famous for its high level of education. A good education can be obtained at any other place too. The only difference is that the boys of this school... are taught to be leaders in every field. The proof of this is the lnter School Sports shield. The person chosen as the sports captain this year is the young man... who has taken the responsibility ... to win this shield. He is Shekhar Malhotra. l'm sure you will win it the third time too and set a new record. Who are the brave boys? - Rajput! Who are the leaders? - Rajput! Sanju... - Yes, father? Have you got your results? - No, not yet. You got your results a fortnight ago. lt was under your pillow. Leave alone lying, you have no regrets about failing. You still keep loitering with your good-for-nothing friends. Someone with dignity would have had sleepless nights. He would have found it difficult to swallow food. Shakur, let him go! He'll come around when he's hungry. Are you aware? Sanju, Maksood and Ghanshyam ... have failed again. And now, these scoundrels will be in your class. Why do you mingle with those loafers? Aren't there nice girls in your class? They talk nonsense. - And they talk about high ideals! Their language is horrible. They abuse a lot and use slang while speaking. Wow! What language! What do you want? l wanted the newspaper, uncle. Do you want the price of gold? - Pardon me...? lt is right there, take it. ... And bring me my wallet. Anjali, give me a napkin. Coming. Ratan... Yes, father? - Here's a new blazer for you. You will be receiving an award today, so don't wear the old one. Yes father. Take this money. - That's not necessary. Keep it, and don't forget to pay respects to your mother. l will. Ratan, your new blazer looks great. - lsn't it good? Ratan, l want Rs.50. - Do you want to buy books? Aren't you giving it to me? - No. Did you see that? Ratan gets a new blazer... as well as money and l don't get anything. lt happens with me always. Take a look at my shoes ... They're torn. Sanju, do you need money? Do you have any? - How much do you want? 40... 50. - l'll get it. You, idiot! You are taking advantage of her feelings? Nonsense! She is my good friend and cares about me, unlike you. Ramlal's efforts are the sole reason... behind the fine performance by Pradip Kumar, Afzal Khan... and Ratanlal of our school. And Ratanlal came second in the marathon cycle race. For this achievement, he is awarded the school champion badge. This is your final year, Ratan. This time you must come first. l'll try my best. ''He is called as a conqueror, friends...'' ''he who knows how to win a losing battle'' ''The day we come into the field euphoric...'' ''we will conquer with a victory'' ''Why should we go along with the world?'' ''Why should we kill ourselves with exercise?'' ''Why should we be scared of parents or the teachers?'' ''We are the conquerors here'' ''We can tackle with everyone'' ''Beware of us, my friends'' ''lf they don't understand us'' ''How does it matter to us? ''We know how to win a losing battle'' ''These lanes are ours as well as the roads'' ''Why should we feel scared?'' ''Any one messing with us...'' ''will get aside feeling scared'' ''We are the conquerors here'' ''We can tackle with everyone'' ''Don't mess with us my dears'' ''lf they don't understand us,'' ''how does it matter to us'' ''We know how to win a losing battle'' ''These beautiful innocent angels'' ''Are all crazy for wealth'' ''When they realise the value of true love'' ''They will go crazy about us'' ''We are the conquerors here'' ''We can tackle with everyone'' ''We also are no less than any princes'' ''lf they do not understand us, how does it matter?'' ''We know how to win a losing battle'' Damn you ! Swine! Take a look at that boy. He's eating nuts like a monkey. He looks like one. - Look at his antics. What will you have? - A cheese sandwich. 2 cheese sandwiches. Make it fast Sanju, make two milk shakes. Ramu, make two cheese toasts. Get up! Look, he's giving it a try. l have a good mind to hit them. Now watch the charm of Shekhar Malhotra. Who doesn't know the inter college champion? We visited Sidney point today. lt is a beautiful place. Will you come along sometime? - Sure. Chilled. He's too proud of himself. You've fetched the bottles but forgotten the straws... Fool! He's got the intelligence of a child. lgnore them. They are jealous of you. He panicked. The Xavier's boys are scoundrels. ldiot! What have you done! How did this happen? How, l ask! The boys from Xavier's and Rajput had a scuffle and they broke the furniture By fighting over a couple of girls from Queens college... you have maligned the reputation of Rajput college. lf you have a goon-like tendency, you should have joined a sleazy college. And you, Shekhar,... The captain of this college... Weren't you ashamed of quarreling at an ordinary cafe? Sir, it was my fault. lt won't occur again. lf it occurs again, you will be suspended. All of you. You will not be allowed to leave the hostel for two weeks. Stop it, Sanju. Did you speak to the Principal of Rajput College? Yes. Damage was done to us but they weren't sufficiently punished. Go and complain some more. - Why were you jealous? Was it because a Rajput boy... easily charmed a girl from Queens. What nonsense! l don't care about such cheap girls. As if they care about you. My dear brother, a girl who could knock me out of my senses, hasn't stepped on earth as yet Who is the new girl? - Spoilt brat of a rich father, maybe. Hey! Are you blind? He's gone. Look at him. They are asking for trouble. 2 chocolate milk shakes. Hi Rina, How are you? - Who are you? l'm Ganshu. Have you forgotten? We met in Delhi at the market. We were having snacks. Don't you remember, Rina? My name is not Rina, but Tina. What will you have, Tina? Or, will you have Chikoo? lt is great... We won't do it again ! The old woman has a firm hand. She has skinned me. Aren't you new? l thought l'd accompany you. The boys in blue coats are from Rajput college. They're from affluent families The boys in red blazers are from Xavier's. And those boys in green blazers? Don't even look at them. They are from Model College. They are trash. We call them jerks. Jerks? - Yes, dear. They are jerks who look like hungry wolves. l have decided never to give girls from Queens college a ride. Hey... who is she? Wow! - O Lord! Boys are dropping dead. Should l call the ambulance? The yellow headband... who is he? - Shekhar Malhotra, inter college champion. He is J.K.Malhotra's son. The owner of Malhotra Steel Mills? There is no girl worth knowing. - Neither is your Richa around. What did you do the last time? - Nothing, just a kiss. A good night kiss! Your kiss is sufficient. Who is that girl? She must be new. Seated beside her is Ruksana, from Queens, who always says 'dear'. She is impressed. Hey! ...He's gone. The swine! ...He's gone to prey. Do you know me? - Who doesn't? Scoundrel! Why are you laughing? lt angers me, that a rogue is fooling a naive girl. One ought to tell her that Shekhar was dating Richa. Don't worry, Sanju. l'll take her aside and explain everything . Even l can take her aside in the corner if it is necessary. Everyone has a corner but no one has a girl friend. Hey...l'll hit you ! - Get lost! This is insolence! - Will you complain about this too? l don't have the time for this bickering. We are here to train. Whose training? ... Are these your champions? And take a look at this bag of bones. Look Paunchy, there's no need to be angry. As for the cycle race, l'm the champion around here. No local boy can beat me! And l shall win the race this year too... and blacken the faces of these scoundrels. You're a scoundrel! Your family is full of scoundrels! l'll break your face. l'll break your face. - Why are you fighting with them? Hey fighter, pay heed to your dad. Else you'll be severely beaten. Let's disperse. Uncle, l've brought a vegetable dish. l have already eaten. They will have it. Sanju, will you have some? l won't spare them. Why are you kicking up a storm? Forget about what happened. How can l? You are afraid of them. They insulted father and you kept mum! You are gutless. l am not afraid of anyone. - Then, why did you keep mum? Violence is not the solution. - Neither is submission. Sanju is right. We ought to give them a fit reply. l spared them because of father. Next time l won't spare them. What will you do? You talk utter rubbish. Shekhar is proud and very ill-mannered. Ratan will break his pride. Ratan, l have decided to buy an imported cycle for you. But father, an imported cycle costs around 12 to 15 thousand rupees. lt's alright. l'll save every penny, and l'll even borrow if l have to. Didn't he say that no local boy could beat him? This year, he will not win but leave in defeat at your hands. Where did you go with Shekhar? - Nowhere in particular. What did you do? - We had a casual conversation. Did anything interesting happen? - That will take place tomorrow. But we're going to Sidney point on a school picnic tomorrow. ls Shekhar coming there? - Yes. He said that... he would fling himself from Sidney point if l'm not there. Deposit this Rs 1000 in the bank. - Alright, father. l'm off to Mr.Dube's place and l'll have my meal there. Ramu, return these empty crates to the soft drink delivery man... and take delivery of 4 crates of soft drinks. l'll settle the accounts when l return. Sanju, put this bread in the oven. Take this. l'm going to the bank. - l'll go to the bank instead. Father has directed me to go to the bank. Kalpana... hi. - Hello Ratan Do you need something? - l need some bread? Bread...? Take a seat. No, it's alright. Please sit. l'll bake some fresh bread and get it for you. Sanju, go to the bank. l'll bake the bread. No, you go to the bank and l'll bake the bread for Kalpana. Don't act smart. All right... But take my advice. Grab her and give her a kiss. Come on friends, it's too hot out here. ''They spoke with their eyes'' ''And found life partners'' Oh,... The bread! Hey! What are you doing? This is Mr.Wadia's car. lf he comes to know, l'll be in trouble. Damn Wadia. Just a moment. l'll go and buy some flowers. Hurry up! Hey, what are you doing! Where are you going? Stop! ldiots! Stop! What luck! They are three and we are also three. The one in the centre is mine. - Ganshu, hop over to the store and pick up three cigarettes. The girls will be impressed with our style. You have brains! - Get filter cigarettes. All right. Ghode, fetch some mint, too. - Why? When you approach them, your breath will smell fresh. Go. Please stop! Please don't be angry. l've missed my school bus. l got to go to Sidney Point lf l don't reach there, there could be a great problem. l am Devika. - And l am Sanjaylal. Yes. lnstead of your picnic, come along to Mallroad for a coffee. Some other time, perhaps. You mentioned something about a coffee. There's a boy who is running like crazy. ls he calling to you? No. - Devika, listen to me. Sanjay considers himself to be very smart. l'll make him pay for the cigarettes. And why did you have to get off? He asked me to fetch mint. - Shut up! Don't you have any brains? What? Greetings, sir! - Greetings. So you know me, eh? Who doesn't know you, sir! You are the lord of this village. Oh, all right! ... Do you have matches? Offer the matches to the lady. How are your cattle? - lt is all your grace, sir. Bad crops this year, l hear. - There's been no rain... and we have no money and... - Oh... keep this. Share it. Thank you, sir. - You are welcome. Thank you, madam. Enjoy yourself...At last your wish has been granted. Come along. Hey! ls my Mercedes ready? - No, sir. Oh, no! Where is your father? He has gone to the police station to file a report. A thief stole one of our cars. lt was similar to yours. lt is a green Maruti Gypsy. What a state this country has come to! Devika, l hate thieves. lt's a small place but the coffee is great. Hey! Come here. Fetch 2 cups of special coffee and... What happened? - There's a problem with the chair. Hey! Change your chairs. What did he want? - He's placed a tall order. Who will pay for it? - No one. Have some. These pastries are really good. Look! lt's those jerks again. Greetings, sir! ... Greetings, madam! Hello! We were passing through... - So we decided to pay you a visit. We were famished and ... all our money was stolen. Serve them too. Thank you, sir. We won't forget your favour. Let's make ourselves at home. Hey, waiter! Give us 3 menu cards. Did you really come for coffee or to make someone jealous? Do you know Shekhar? Yes, and l also know that he'd called you to Sidney point today Yesterday, l overheard Shekhar talking to his friends. He mentioned that it took him a while to woo Kamla, Bimla and Richa. But Devika readily dropped into his lap. He's a liar! Richa is from Queens College, but who are Kamla and Bimla? They were from Sitaram college. They returned home. Why? They were cheated. - What happened? How can l tell you? - Please tell me. This is what happened to them. That must be it. l hear that it's Shekhar's old habit. l'll teach him a lesson that he'll never forget. l'll seek revenge on him for insulting me today. How? Will you help me? Shall l contact you at Xavier's? - Yes... No! l share my name with a couple of scoundrels. Then? - There's another number... 202. Add my bill to my account. Thank you, sir. ... Madam! Waiter, fetch us 3 menus. Get lost! - l'll pay you Rs 100, smartass! She's walking on air since the time she met Shekhar. She'll come to her senses when she becomes like this. ls Shekhar really like that, dear? And who is Sanju? - Xavier's boy. l have befriended Sanju, to seek revenge on Shekhar. l don't want a romantic involvement. - So, Sanju is a nobody? He is not a nobody. Any boy who gives a tip of Rs 200... for a match, is surely somebody. Rs 100! Who gave it to you? - Sanju. And Sanju took it back. - Hey, give it back! This belongs to father and l have to return it to him. Hey! What would happen if l told Devika the truth? She would have left. l didn't want to befriend her. l wanted to seek revenge on Shekhar, which l have done. 2 plates of samosas please. - Yes, sir. lt's blank. Dear Ratan. Why didn't you return the chit that fell from Kalpana's books? lt bore your name. - My name?... where is it? The letter will cost Rs 20 - What! All right. Give me Rs 10. - l won't give a single penny. All right. l'm off. Come here. Here's a tenner. This is your Diwali gift. And l'm not interested in the letter. Take this... don't hesitate. - l told you, l don't want it. Read. Might contain something special. - Get lost. Dear Ratan, l don't know what has come over me. l've been dreaming about you. Tonight is Diwali. All the boys and girls will be gathered at the courtyard. lf you come holding a red rose in your hand,... l will assume that you love me too. With love from Kalpana. Nazima, come here. Give Kalpana this letter... and tell her that it is from Ratan. - Okay Kalpana, this is from Ratan. Dear Kalpana, l don't know what has come over me. l've been dreaming about you. Tonight you will surely come to the courtyard. And if you carry a red rose, l will assume that you love me too. With love from Ratan. All the boys here are crazy about the girls from Queens. And those girls don't even given them a second glance. Even we ought to do the same. All boys are the same. lf you express your feelings, they don't care. And if you play hard to get, they come after you. ls that so? - Yes, of course. Try it and see. Who is your mule? Whose did you steal? - Shut up... Take this. Look over there. Let's tease him. Why are you holding a red rose? Let me see. Let's see. - lt's deep red! lt's a rose. Hey, look there! Kalpana is also holding a red rose. ls something going on? He has improved. l'll call Anjali over, surely Kalpana will accompany her. Don't you want to speak to her? - l don't want to speak to anyone. Hang on ! lt will be fun. Anjali, come here! Refuse. Tell him to get lost. - Get lost! Acting smart, eh? Come here! Hold your ground. You come here, you pigeon. Hey, why can't you listen? ''Those who are crazy after the girls of this city'' ''What can they know about our elegance...'' ''you disloyal sweetheart'' ''The one who doesn't realize..'' ''Who l'm crazy about'' ''What can she understand about'' ''the style of my amorousness'' ''Understand me, my love'' ''There may be many beauties, but we are no less'' ''Have a proper look at us'' ''Don't be so boastful it can be that..'' ''ultimately you might land up no where'' ''Those who are crazy after the the girls of the city...'' ''What can they know about our elegance...'' ''you disloyal sweetheart'' ''Come here'' ''No, no! - Come into my arms, '' ''don't go away'' - Never'' ''Many have gone crazy'' ''You can't escape either'' ''Hearing my plea... with all style'' ''will come running towards me'' ''The one who doesn't realize'' ''Whom l'm crazy about'' ''What can she understand about the style of my amorousness'' ''Understand, my love'' ''Those who are crazy after the girls of this city'' ''What'd they know about the elegance of our simplicity?'' ''My disloyal sweetheart'' ''Try and understand sweetheart'' Tonight, Sanju sat beside me long after everyone had left. He seemed as though he wanted to say something. l thought l'd say it myself that you mean everything to me. Numskull, how can l explain to you? Devika, please listen l have nothing to do with Richa. ln fact, l was fooling her. Like Kamla and Bimla? Anyway, why did you call? Devika, l'd like to meet you alone some place. Like Kamla and Bimla? - What! Never mind that! l'm coming to Mallroad today. Where exactly? - Ahead of Mallroad there... is a road going uphill. A tree bearing yellow flowers. Wait for me at 5 p.m. beneath that tree. Who are you calling now? Who is Sanjay? - Hey! Give it to me. Yes, Devika. Go on. - l have an appointment... with Shekhar at 5 this evening. Could you come to Mallroad at 4 pm? You will have to come there with some supplies. Sure. A long rope... 2 buckets. And... what? All right, l'll be there. What are you looking at? - The necklace in the centre. lsn't it beautiful? - Yes. lt costs Rs 4000. - So ? l'll get it for you. Why are you sweet talking me? Mr Thapar's car is at your garage. And l have to return it today. - Correct. l could take it to him... and get it back under some pretext. We could go for a drive in the evening Good idea. But what will we do if Thapar keeps the car? Wait and see. l'll get around him. Add the fresh one too. - All right. Here... My stomach is hurting. Shekhar, why have you brought us along? l'll look like a fool if l stand alone beneath this tree. So you want all of us to look like fools, eh? As you wish. Well? - What? Take him somewhere. - This fellow. Go, get some relief. Devika! There's someone with her. l won't spare him. Why are you hitting me? Help! We missed him! Where have you brought me? - This is my house. ls this your house? l'll go and tell father that l'm going out. Sir, l have brought your car from Girdhari Garage. Give the keys and leave. The engine is knocking. Shall l take it back and repair it? You bring back the car after 10 days and it's still not ready! Commissioner, the locals are thieves. When they take the car to the garage they keep it. l know how to deal with the likes of you. Randhir, take the keys from him and throw him out. Give the keys. Sanjay, your house is very impressive. Was your father angry? He was angry because l was late for the party. l tossed the car keys in anger, l'll have to drop you in taxi. Your father appears to be very hot tempered. So am l. Someday, l shall leave this house and his wealth. Devika, if l didn't have any of this wealth,... would you... What? Nothing. Sanjay, l know what you're trying to say. Would you believe me if l told you something? Go ahead. Sanjay, when l first met you, l didn't know who you were. But it seemed as though l had been waiting for you. lt is the truth, Sanjay. l do not care for money. Even if you don't have anything in the future... you'll mean the same to me. This is my memento. You might forget me in the future, but l shall never forget you. l will have to solder it. lt will take 5 to 10 minutes. All right. - l'll be back soon. Give it to me. - What happened? What is it? - l'm on fire. The flame of love. Why are you being so dramatic? ls it gold? - Yes. Someone has given it to me with trembling hands and a throbbing heart. Who? - Devika. Never! You are lying Big brother, you are the heavy muscular type. A heavy model like you, wouldn't understand love. Cut the crap. Tell me, have you told her anything? No. Not as yet. Therein lies the problem. lt's difficult to say anything. lt is not difficult. All you need to do is take a decision. Have you come to a decision? - Yes, of course. What will you say? - What is there to say? l'll hold her hand like this, look into her eyes and say, l love you. Ganshu, Ghode, listen to me. - Not now. lt's something special. - My father will kick my butt. l've soldered it, but is it okay if l fix it tomorrow? All right, l'll come for it tomorrow. Hi Anjali, l was on my way to see you. - Really! Let's sit here. - Anjali, come home soon. Yes, father. Oh yes, l couldn't bring the car back. Thapar made mince meat of me. l knew that. Anjali, l want to tell you something. lt's something special. - Go on. l don't know how to say it. You might wonder at the sudden change in Sanju. You won't laugh at me, will you? The fact is... Anjali, serve dinner. - l'll be there. Go on, Sanju. No, not right now. We'll go and speak in privacy tomorrow. ''Whether you say it or not...'' ''but l have already heard it'' ''You have chosen me as your soulmate in love'' ''You have chosen me...'' ''and l have already heard it'' ''The first euphoria and the ecstasy...'' ''The love is afresh, and so is the await'' ''What should l do oh my love lorn heart'' ''Oh my love lorn heart, you only tell me'' ''l'm flying high in these euphoric winds'' ''Or should l swing with these clouds'' ''Or should l get the sky and the earth together'' ''Tell me friends what to do and what not to do'' ''The first euphoria and the ecstasy...'' ''He spoke to me in such a manner that..'' ''he gave me the colourful dreams of love'' ''As is l remain helpless'' ''And he kisses me with all his love'' ''The first euphoria and the ecstasy'' ''The love is afresh and so is the await'' ''What should l do...'' ''oh my lovelorn heart'' Keep this as my memento. You might forget me in the future, but l shall never forget you. Sanju... - Yes, father. Deposit this Rs.5000 in the bank. - Yes, father. What are you looking at, Anjali? There was a lovely pearl necklace here. - lt is sold. Ramlal's son Sanjay bought it this morning. Do you wanting anything else? - No, thank you. What happened? - Sanju is crazy. There was a necklace here. l said that l liked it so he got it for me. So, what? - No, it is very expensive. l don't want such an expensive gift. l'll get Sanju to return it. Ratan, have you seen Sanju? - l saw him heading for sunset point. Sanju, wake up! We have to go for practice. Let go of me! - Get up! All right, l'm up. - Come quickly. Where are the rest? Sanju is here too! lf he comes once, he takes a break for several days. Have you taken the full round today? - One hour 10 minutes. lf this was the race, l would have won it. You would have won it last year. But Shekhar forged ahead lt is the last few seconds that decide the defeat and victory. Whatever it may be, everyone believes that... only you can defeat Shekhar. lt's true. - Hopes can make a person nervous. Especially father. He keeps dreaming of my victory and Shekhar's defeat. He wants to buy an ltalian cycle for me. lt costs Rs.20,000. - 20,000? l fear that if l don't win, father will heartbroken. This training is very good. We ought to take it too. Okay! With such training, you'll surely beat Shekhar. We have seen nothing. You may continue. Sanju meets me very rarely these days. Perhaps he only remembers me when he needs a car. lt hurts me, Sanju. But l can still... do anything for you. Don't ever forget me, Sanju. Who is accompanying her? What is she doing with a boy from Model? Do you know Devika? She is from Queens College and is of our class. How dare a stupid localite of Model College, befriend her? Are you Devika's father? - Mind your language, bastard! And l am not a bastard but you are. Come on, jerk! What happened? Why are you fighting? Sir, he is attempting to ruin a respectable girl. Which girl? - Devika. From Queens College. She is my family friend. - Cut the crap! Shut up! - Get lost! You are standing upright now. Lest my boys break your ribs. Understand? What happened, Sanju? - Quiet! You're spoiling him. He must have started the fight. - Don't interfere in my matters. l don't need your sermon. l'm glad to have found you. l have something important to discuss. Let's go sit somewhere. - Not now. l have to go for rehearsals Next Sunday is the a dance competition. We're participating with Rajput College Shekhar is also participating. Right now, l want to tell you about myself. Devika, hurry up. The bus is leaving. l'm off now, we'll meet at the dance competition. You are in the Xavier's team, right? - Yes. ln the lnter School Dance Competition, after St.Peter's College, is Xavier's College at number four. ''We are crazy for love, we are love lorn'' ''Our songs are full of youth'' ''Because of us is this world'' ''Where ever you see in the darkness of the night'' ''Or you search in the morning light'' ''We all are seen, no one can be are equal'' ''The world is because of us'' Let's see how many points the judges have given them. After the spectacular performance by Xavier's,... the next college is Model. Xavier's performed well, didn't they? Now, it is Model's turn. ''You are young, my friends. Come on, don't feel depressed'' ''Look at me!'' ''Agreed that l have no money now, but that won't be forever'' ''Even my fate will shine one day'' ''Believe me, my friends'' ''Manage with whatever you earn through hard work'' ''Don't eye what others have'' ''Fate will smile on us too one day'' ''The world will envy us too'' ''Agreed that l have no money now, but that won't be forever'' ''Even my fate will shine one day'' ''Believe me, my friends'' l have won a lottery! ''You are young, my friends. Come on, don't feel depressed'' ''Look at me!'' ''Agreed that l have no money now, but that won't be forever'' ''Even my fate will shine one day, my friends'' ''Believe me, my friends'' That was Model College. l can hardly believe... that Model college could give such a lovely performance. Now, it's our turn. l believe, the judges are taking some time to give the points. And now for last year's winning teams, Queens College and Rajput College. ''My name is Fonseca'' You don't know me, baby'' ''You cannot escape me, you will have to come to me'' ''My name is Monica. l won't be intimidated by your threats'' ''l will go where l please'' ''l own a car and a bungalow'' ''Moreover, l will even love you'' ''All your big talks are a sham'' ''Your boots are borrowed, your suit is hired'' ''My name is Fonseca. You don't know me, baby'' ''You cannot escape me, you will have to come to me'' ''Sorry O dear, l did not understand you'' ''You are just the right guy to marry'' ''My dreams will all come true now'' ''We give a damn for those who envy us'' ''My name is Fonseca. You don't know me, baby'' ''You cannot escape me, you will have to come to me'' Last year's winning teams, Rajput and Queens college. All the colleges have performed well in today's competition. The judges decision is before me. Let's see who are the winners. Shakur, l'm off to the bank and l might be delayed. Yes, sir. l'm sorry that l couldn't meet you after the dance. Even if we had met, l would have said the same thing. You're absolutely wonderful, Sanjay. l didn't know that you were so great. You ought to get the first prize for what you did. l worked very hard, but l must have lacked something to have missed it. You didn't understand. Anyway, forget it. l'll be there at Mallroad at approximately 8 O'clock. All right, at 8. Where are you coming from? - The doctor's clinic. Why? - l've got fever. Goodness! You ought to rest. Why are you loitering around? l'm on my way home. Anjali, could l get a car from your garage? Where do you have to go? Devika's coming to meet me today and l'll have to drop her back. You can take it. Oh Anjali, sometimes l feel as though l am in a dream. Frankly, l'd never contemplated that a rich girl like Devika... would fall in love with me. - Sanju, may l say something? Sure. - Are you sure she really loves you? l mean, some girls are hard to understand. No, Anjali. lt is not a case of mistaken feelings. Have you told her all about yourself? - That l'm from Model? She realised that on the day of the dance competition. And she knows... no wealthy boy studies at Model. No wonder she went pale when she saw you. What? - Yes, Sanju. The moment she realised you were from Model and not Xavier's... What nonsense! lf that was the case, why would she call me? Why would she praise my dance and come to meet me today? All girls are not the same. Devika is not a gold digger. She likes me. She loves Sanju. Don't be naive, Sanju. She doesn't love you. You are raving. lnstead of being happy for me, you're trying to create doubts No Sanju, l'm trying to stop you from making a mistake. l don't want you to be deeply hurt. Anjali, l don't like this pointless talk from you. lf you don't approve the truth, l'll never speak to you again. l won't meet you either. l don't want to see you either. Sanju, you shouldn't speak to Anjali in this manner. Why? What was wrong with my statement? Let it be. ... Bye, Sanju. Everyone seems to have gone crazy. Shakur, l'm going out and l'll be back in a short while. Hey! Who will serve at the tables? Don't go anywhere. Hey, waiter! What will you have, Devika? - What do you get here? Nothing special, it's a lousy cafe. Now that we're here, let's have some coffee... or the poor chap will lose his tip. Fetch us 2 cups of coffee. And make sure that the cups are washed and clean. Chotu, give me 2 cups of coffee. See? He doesn't seem to be ashamed. He is a perfect example of a jerk from Model School. ls this Thapar's son? - That's what he told me. Why would Thapar's son be at this joint? Perhaps his father threw him out, so he has to work at this lousy cafe. Hey! There's no need to stand around. Fetch the bill when we have finished our coffee. You'll get paid for the coffee as well as receive a tip. Get lost! Thapar's son ! You said, money didn't matter to you. You said that it wouldn't matter if l didn't have anything in the future. So it was a lie. Someone who starts out with a lie, has no right to call anyone else a liar. l admit that l lied. But l did it only to disguise my poverty. And you lied to disguise your deceit. Until yesterday l was Thapar's son, so you approved of me. And now that l am an ordinary man's son, l disgust you. That's because you want a rich boyfriend. lf not Thapar's son... Malhotra's son Shekhar will do, regardless of his bad character. Right? Yes, that's it. What is the matter, Devika? - Nothing. Hey Jerk, l've left you Rs 10 at your cafe. Take it from your champion brother. Why are you hiding your face now? She wouldn't even care to spit on it. Stay within your limits, you'll be happy. Go and take the tenner. Beat him! Don't spare him! Pick him up. You woo a girl, eh? You're Model's hero, eh? Bloody localite! How dare you woo a girl from Queens? You've become too big for your boots. Didn't l tell you... l did not want any tricks from you? Bastard! Don't spare him! Break his bones! Will you approach a girl again? Do you take us for fools? Careful... watch it! Get lost! Both of you go home. Come along! l've warned you not to war with these boys. You're still on Devika's case. Mark my words, this fight will blow out of proportion. And, if l hadn't arrived, they would have broken all your bones. Hey! l could have handled them alone. Who asked you to interfere? Don't pretend to be a great saviour. l see! So you're very strong, eh? ... Come on. Ratan, l warn you. Don't mess with me. Are you afraid? - Hey! l gave you Rs 5000 to deposit at the bank but this shows only Rs 1000. Father, you didn't give me any money. Oh yes, l had given it to Sanju. Sanju... l had... What's this? You've fought again ! l gave you 5000 to deposit at the bank. But this shows only Rs 1000. How much did you deposit? Why don't you answer? Rs 1000. 1000? What about the remaining Rs 4000? l spent it. Spent it! What did you spend on? Why don't you tell me? lt wasn't a paltry sum that you spent with no explanations! Did you gamble? Where is the Rs 4000? Tell me! l can't tell you, but l will return the money. l'm working day and night in order to buy a cycle for Ratan. And you blow it up without a second thought. Get out! Get out! And don't you dare to return ! Father, there's no need to go to Delhi to buy a new cycle. lt will be an unnecessary expense. Besides, my old cycle will suffice. Don't worry about it. l'll be back by 11 p.m. All right, father. Father, please forgive Sanju. l'll reason with him. lt won't happen again. Allow him to come home. Let's go. Sanju, father has gone to Delhi and he will return at 11 p.m. l apologised on your behalf and he has forgiven you. Come home now. l know you're angry with me. l shouldn't have hit you. Next time, l will ignore the fact that you are my older brother. And l don't need your pity. Here's your blanket. lt wasn't me, but Anjali, who covered you with this blanket. Anyway, l'm sorry. Yesterday, your fighter and you were lucky because l wasn't present. What will you do today? l'll give you the same treatment that l gave your friends. You will have to be taught a lesson. Let's see who teaches whom a lesson? Ratan's met with an accident. - What! How did it happen? l don't know, but it seems that he fell off the cliff with his cycle. He has been taken to the Government hospital... hurry! Doctor, l am Ratan's younger brother. How is he? What has happened to him? - Where is your father? He has gone to Delhi. - When will he return? Tonight. - Bring him over as soon as he returns But, doctor, what's happened to him? - The operation is badly needed. l don't have the time to spare. No one can defeat Ratan now. Call Ratan. Father... - What is the matter? l have forgiven you. But don't repeat this mistake again. Go... go and fetch Ratan. Ratan has met with an accident. ... He is in the hospital. The state in which he was brought, required an emergency operation. He's still in coma. l do not wish to raise false hopes. His condition is very critical. Be brave. Yes. Last night, l fought with Ratan. This morning he came to pacify me, but l didn't respond. lf anything happens to him... What will happen now? How will father survive? Ratan means everything to father. He... and you too. ''lf ever you got annoyed with me...'' ''and went away ..'' ''l had never expected to miss you so much'' ''l could never walk even two steps...'' ''without you'' ''Yet in my innocence, l always thought ... ''you will never leave me'' ''l had never expected to miss you so much'' ''lf ever you got annoyed with me...'' ''and went away...'' Ratan has regained consciousness. l'm returning from the hospital. He's fine. He even spoke to me. The Lord has answered our prayers! What if he tells the police? l warned you to tell the principal, but you... lt would have been better if he had died. Water... water... - l'll get it. lf you tell anything to anyone, the consequences won't be good. Get that? What was he doing here, so late? Tell me. You are keeping something from me. What is the matter? Tell me. - l'll tell you. Sanju, do you think that l'll be alright for the race? Drink your medicine. The race is on the 24th of next month. Even if l get a week's practice, it will suffice. What say? Don't worry, you'll be fine. There's still a month and a half left. - Yes, a month and a half left. This time, l will defeat him. Sanju, l will surely defeat him this time. l won't spare him. l'll defeat him. Come along, Sanju. Hurry up, Ghode, let's go. Shall we go? Anjali, l will participate in the cycle race this year. What! Are you serious? - Yes. l might not be able to take Ratan's place... but it's the least l can do for father. Do your best, Sanju. l'm with you all the way. ldiot, you are taking advantage of her feelings for you ! What is the matter? Anjali, you might consider it strange,... but l'd like to tell you what l have been feeling ... these last few days. - What? l have always considered you as my closest friend. But... l have grown to love you now. You'll be perfectly alright in another 3 or 4 weeks. Until then, take care that you don't put too much weight on this leg. Don't be dejected. lt is destiny. lt doesn't matter that you can't take part in the race tomorrow. Without you, Shekhar's victory will be meaningless anyway. lt is Ratan's cycle. Only a little work remains to be done. Tomorrow is the race ... and Sanju wants to use this cycle for the race. What is the matter, Kalpana? Aren't you aware of Ratan's grief? He had worked very hard to participate in this race. And now... he is not in this race. And Sanju is responsible for all of it. Sanju? - Yes. lf he hadn't messed around with Shekhar... Shekhar and his friends wouldn't... - What did they do? Anjali, please don't disclose this to anyone. Ratan forbade me to do so. Please, Anjali, for my sake. Why didn't you tell me? - What? You know perfectly well. Shekhar and his friends attempted to kill you and you kept mum?! Ratan, you aren't aware of what father and l have been through. We nearly lost you. lt's my fault. You became the target for Shekhar's enmity towards me. Where are you going? - Let me go! Let go of the rod! - Let me go! Leave it! Do you want to know why l kept mum? Listen carefully. When l came to my senses, l noticed that you had changed. You had changed completely. You had begun to realise your responsibilities You learned to appreciate me. .... and father. You became closer to us. l was very happy. For your happiness, l couldn't care if anything happened to me. l troubled you so much. Yet you never said anything to me. l know you love me, Sanju. That's why you want to take revenge. You want to do something for me? Yes. Then forget all this. l have prepared the new cycle for you. Take it and try your best at the race tomorrow. Who are the brave kids? - Rajput! Rajput! Who are the leaders? - Rajput! Rajput! Senior boys 200m race. Shekhar of Rajput leads from the start, Randhir from Xavier's is behind him... very closely.

The first cyclists have reached Pillar Rock. ln the lead is Shekhar Malhotra from Rajput College. ln fifth place is Sanjaylal Sharma from Model College. Be careful, or you might fall! Come along. - The jerk is losing air. Bastard! l was bound by my promise to Ratan, ... but l won't spare you now. Because of you, my brother is not participating in today's race. l'll see how you are able to finish this race. Get lost, jerk! l'll see how you try to stop me. You hit my brother. This is Ratan's reply. You won't let me finish the race, eh? They've gone ahead! Shekhar, go ahead. We'll take care of him. Don't set him free. Well...
