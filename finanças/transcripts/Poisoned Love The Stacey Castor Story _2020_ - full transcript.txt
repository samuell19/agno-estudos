- Bree! - Go away! Bree!! Leave me alone! Ulgh! We gotta go! Bree, did you take my belt? I don't have your stupid belt. Wait your turn. Ladies, breakfast is on the table. We gotta go! Bree! Give me my belt! I know you took my belt. Is it too much to ask for you to not touch my stuff? I didn't touch your stuff. Ashley, Bree. Try to play nice. Look what I found. Alright, let's go! She's your spawn. If you girls want a ride, you've got to hurry up. I'm late. Mark's giving me a ride. Is that a new boyfriend? It's not a big deal. Sure looked like it through the steamed windows yesterday. You're funny. Hey, Ashley. I want to hear all about it. I always want to know what's going on in your life, okay? Yeah. Grow up. Mom! Finish breakfast. So I'm going to go over this again, because it keeps happening. But... Sorry. Remember, past 30 days we do not service them until the accounts are paid in full. Okay, now let's get back to work. Stacey? I need a word. Third time this week. It puts me in an awkward... Position. What kind of position? My favourite. Shh, they're going to hear. I don't care. I'll fire 'em. So, dinner tonight? I can't tonight. It's movie night. I barely see the girls as it is. Tomorrow? Okay, tomorrow it is. Shh. It's not over yet. Just a few more minutes. We've seen this movie like a hundred times. He sweeps her off her feet, they live happily ever after. Gotta go. Love you. Love you, too. Buh-bye. Yeah. Hate you. Guess it's just US. I love spending a Saturday night with you. So, I've been thinking about US. It's just that it's been almost a year. I always have to do what's right for my girls, but that's not really fair to you, because I have to schedule US. But... I don't want to miss another night or morning. So, you want to live together? If it was just me, sure. But you'd be taking on a family, all three of US. It's... probably not a good idea. - Okay. - Okay. Because I think it's a great idea. I don't want to miss another night or morning. Will you marry me? God, yeah. David. David, god! - Congratulations! - Thank you so much. Can I interest you in some muffins? Why are you acting so weird? I was thinking for movie night, we could watch "lord of the rings." Seriously? You hate that movie. Okay. How about a horror movie? "The ring." You ever heard of it? Does it ring a bell? My god, mom. When did this happen? Last night! You're engaged? Yes. To David. No, to the mailman. You guys have been going out for what, a year? Well, that's seven in dog years. And believe me, at my age you count 'em all. I think it's awesome, mom. Of course you do. What, you can't be happy for me? You hardly know him. Is he moving in with US? We're going to move in with him. Will we get our own rooms? Doesn't he live in midland? That's a different school district. It's just a few miles away. You'll still see your friends. You should've asked if it was okay with US first. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm asking. What's the difference? You've already said yes. That doesn't make me his indentured servant. I can tell him we're not ready. It's your life, mom. It's okay with US. Just don't listen to her. No, Ashley's right. The three of US have always been a team, the three musketeers. The last thing I want to do is mess that up. I'm happy for you, mom. You deserve to be happy. I remember when your dad won that for you. Cost him like 60 bucks, but he was determined. And then he gave it to you, and you were like "meh," and he was so sad. Thanks. I'll be sure to feel guilty about that. I didn't mean it like that. It's just that he realized all of a sudden that you were getting too old for these things, and he didn't want that to change. And now you are 17. Do you really love David? Yeah. But I don't want you to think I'm trying to replace your father. Our hearts have an amazing capacity to love equally, but differently. I don't love Bree more than I love you, or the other way around. And I don't love David more than I love your father. That kind of love is endless. Are we good? Yeah. Baby. Hi. Aw, come on. All for one... One for all. There he is. Hey! I'm so sorry, we had a five-some in front of US. It was horrible. We are fine. Hi, girls. Hi. Hey. So here we are. Sounds like we're all going to be living under the same roof. How about that? How about that? We're very excited. Me too. And look, I know this is a pretty big change for you girls, and we haven't spent a lot of time together, but I just want to make sure you're both cool with it, and... What? It just hit me. I should've come to you two first. Like asking someone's father for their daughter's hand in marriage. Out of respect, and I'm sorry I didn't do that. Instead all of this was sprung on you out of the blue, a new house, new school. We would've said yes. Well, that is a relief. Still, um, I should've asked you. I love your mother, and I hope you'll give me a shot. Will we get our own rooms? Bree. Of course. Ashley? Yeah. We're cool. Cool. Well, let's eat. Yeah. Hi, Michael. I really want this, okay? I should be happy. I deserve that. We do miss you. My girls! You look beautiful, mom. Yeah? Thanks. I do, don't I? You look fabulous. I'm so happy for you. Cheese! Your dad's drunk! Get the cameras ready. You look great. Yes, I do, don't I? Julie. Yes. Julie, this is my dad, Alan. I don't think you were properly introduced. My son's a lucky man. Yes, he is. Lean in, everybody. Okay. We're a family now. You guys look good! Okay, and... How's my favourite granddaughter? Don't let Bree hear you say that. I tell her the same thing. He seems nice. And mom's happy. Great. Your mom, she's been through too much. She always chooses you girls over everything and anyone. Don't make her feel like she has to make that choice again. Shoes off, please. New carpet. Right upstairs. Um, I thought we were getting separate rooms. Yeah. Absolutely. Um, that was my office, I just have to clean some of the stuff out. Ashley! In, in! You're perfect. You're right there. Okay, mom, can you please hurry up? I gotta go. I am, hold on. It's not on. Okay, hold on. Mom, there's only two buttons. It's the second button. I got it, okay. Mom! It's on, it's on! Wait, wait, clear a spot. I'm coming in! You're perfect, okay. Ready? Which movie are we watching tonight? I think the boys are going to watch the game tonight, right? It's movie night. We'll watch something tomorrow night. I'm working tomorrow night. Then we'll do it the night after. You know what? I'm sorry. We're going to the bar. No... Movie night is movie night. David, don't. No, no. It's fine. David, why... I said it's fine. Okay? Look, the bar's gonna be fun, there's gonna be some other guys there. Let's go, dad. I'm sorry. You ladies have fun. How was the game? Good. Dropped dad off after. How was he? He's not feeling well, but he seems fine. Look. Sorry, I've been so edgy. Hi. Why don't we go away for a weekend? Just US. What about the girls? They'll be fine. Alone in the house, teenagers? David. You gotta start treating them like they're more than just guests. You know, this is their house too. Trust gets trust. You know what? You're right. So? Babe, I'm already packed. Really? I don't want to leave this room the entire trip. I like that idea. I'll try harder with the girls. I promise. Thank you. Okay, my turn, my turn. Yeah. David's gonna kill you. If he finds out. Go to your room. Hey ash. Any more beer? Yeah, follow me. Can you stop it? You love it. Okay, what do you want? I'll take anything with alcohol. Sweet ride. Don't touch it. Don't even breathe on it. Come on. This is frickin' sweet. Dude. Well, you said he's an ass, right? Yeah, he is. So? He'll never know, but you always will, right? Come on. Just around the block. Dude. Woo! Okay, Jason. Let's go back. I've had my revenge. Okay. Let me turn her around. Enough! Woah, stop, stop it! Are you insane? Stop! Jason, please stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!!! I'm so dead. I trusted you. David trusted you. What were you even thinking? I know! I screwed up. I'm sorry. It's just nothing in this house is ours. His rules, his things. I just, I miss it the way it was. Everything's different. David. I'm so sorry. Sorry is not going to cut it. You are so lucky nobody got hurt. I know. And how you didn't get cited along with your friend is... Is beyond me. So tell me something. How are you going to pay that $500 impound fee? I'll ask for more hours. I swear. Okay. In the meantime, you're grounded. Work, school, that's it. Grounded? I'll make it right, I promise. But you can't ground me. No, no phone, no computer, you are not leaving this house. Mom! Ashley, we'll talk about it tomorrow. Really? Let's give her some space. We'll deal with this tomorrow. What are you doing? Excuse me. What are you doing? What is wrong with you? You're not removing her door. This is no longer her door. I will decide her punishment. Not while she's living in my house. This is our house. No, it's not! It's never been our house. That's a joke. Okay, stop. David, stop. I hate him! I hate being here! Yeah, well the feeling's mutual. Can we please talk about this? There's nothing to talk about. Hey! Stop! I'm talking to you. You know, Stacey, this isn't working. Well, you knew that it wasn't going to be an easy transition. And I have to say, Ashley has not helped. It's been almost a year. That's enough time to make things work. Do you want my blessing? I want your advice. Marriage is difficult. Okay. You have to tough it out. Make it work. What are you going to do if you leave David? Where are you going to live? Where are you going to work? Do you think it was easy living with your dad? Okay, all right. No. You make a choice and you stick with it. Where are my pruners? Right there. This is the first year mom didn't remember, isn't it? Yep. Do you think David will be nicer after what happened? Doubt it. Well, we'd better go. He knows what time we're supposed to be back from school. I'm sorry, daddy. It's been six weeks since you grounded her. I think Ashley has learned her lesson. You think so? Because I haven't seen a real change in attitude. David. That's not being reasonable. No. She used to be an a student and now she's barely passing. I think this whole thing has gotten out of hand. What does that have to do with the door? She's 17. She has a right to privacy, her own room. And her own rules! Is that it? How many times do I have to say I'm sorry? I made a mistake, nothing happened to your stupid car. Ashley. No! This is ridiculous, and you let him do it. Just start showing a little respect around here and maybe we'll talk. Go to hell. Ashley! I hate both of you. You know, it would help if you would show just a little bit of respect to US as well. You're the one who's acting like a child. My... so it's my fault? I'm the bad parent here. The door is closed. Mom's just wondering if you want to come and help make dinner. No, thank you. You're just making it worse. Worse? You can go down there and suck up to him if you want, but I'm not. Please, Ashley. Why? So mom won't be upset. Go. I'm chopping, it's fine. I think that's it, right? Great, thank you. Great. Do you want to get the pasta from the cupboard? Sure. Are you making your special pasta sauce? Actually, David has an idea of his own. A potential disaster. I'm not a cook like your mom, but something my dad passed down. You girls like spicy? Love it. Um, Ashley isn't good with spice though, maybe we could do some a little milder? Sure. It's okay. I'll probably just have salad anyway. You don't know what you're missing. What about if we do a little of both? Excuse me. Hello. What? How? No, no, no, no. I'll come. My dad died. What? What happened? I don't know. He collapsed, I just went to see him yesterday. He was fine. He seemed perfect. My god. Hey. You all right? Can I make you something? No, I'm good. You finished, sweetie? What are you doing? Let her clean it up. You're not her nursemaid. You know, I raised them on my own for six years. I've been a pretty damn good mother. How many drinks is that tonight? So you're counting now? Yeah, David. I am. Self-medicating is not going to help the situation. So now we're in a situation. Drink it, go ahead. Go on, drink yourself stupid. - That's enough. - Is it? You're not going to stop until... Hey, hey! You're not going to stop 'til you kill yourself, so go for it if that's what you want. Just... just shut up, both of you. I can't take this anymore. Neither can I. Where the hell do you think you're going? None of your business. Hey, get your ass back here. Loser. Well, then stay out! Ahhhhh!!!!! Bree! Mom... Look Bree, I'm sorry, I didn't... Get away from US! Stacey!!! Bree and I are at my friend Cheryl's house. Okay. There we go, that's much better. Hey, Ashley's going to stay at Mark's house. That was his mom. Bree, how about we get you up to bed? I'll come up in a minute. How long are we staying here for? A few nights maybe. Give him some time to think about things. I need clothes. I'll sneak back and get some later. Don't worry, mom. He didn't mean it. It'll be okay. I don't know. I haven't seen him in a week. David knew he had a meeting, right? Hello, this is David castor. Please leave a message. I'll get back to you. He's not picking up. David? David? - David? - David? David? Stacey, Stacey, we should call the police! David! Mr. Castor, this is the police. Are you in there? My god. Dispatch, we have a 10-91, Caucasian male, early 50s. My god! [Radio chatters] So, you and your daughters were with friends the entire weekend? Yeah. Ashley stayed with her boyfriend's family, Bree and I were with my friend Cheryl. And had you been noticing any differences in his behaviour? Yeah. Every day. He's been going through a lot, and becoming more and more abusive, self-destructive since his father died. Mom? It's okay. Down the hall. What's going on? That is definitely not an apple Martini. His wife said that he owned a heating and refrigeration company, right? Yeah. Man. That's a hell of a way to kill yourself. Wait. We're going with suicide? Well, there's no forced entry, and no signs of a struggle. I mean, you heard what she said about him, right? I mean, I don't know, we'll see what comes back from the lab, but 50 bucks says yes. Guys, you want to come in? Mason? Yeah? Check this out. Do you find that odd? It's garbage. Nobody's been doing any real cooking in this kitchen for a while. Why is he throwing out a Turkey baster? That's a good question. Bag it and run it to the lab. It's me. It's okay. I'd feel more comfortable if you were staying with me. It's okay, mom. Well, you're not going to sleep in that room. Yeah. I'll sleep in Ashley's room. I just don't think it's good for Bree to be in this house. I'll handle it. You poor dear. Going through all this again. It's... I don't understand how he could do this to you. Sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Castor. It's just his ring. Thank you. It's been ruled a suicide, as we expected. His organs were coated with ethylene glycol toxicity. The antifree. The antifreeze, yes. What? About a month before he died, we were watching a show. One of those news shows on television. It was about a man who had died by ingesting antifree, and David commented how painful it would be to die from that. And yet that's how he chose to do it. I'm sorry. Is there anything else? No. No. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Let me walk you out. Thank you. I do have one more question. Of course. Did David cook? Not really. Pasta every once in a while. Why? It's nothing. I'm just trying to a get a sense of his state of mind. Just this way. When did you say these changes were made to the will? About a month before he died. We never got around to having it notarized. I can't notarize something from a month ago, stace. Or without both parties. It's against the law. I could go to jail. I'm going to lose everything. His life insurance wasn't much, it's 50,000, and he had changed the will because he didn't want everything going to his family. Of course. I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed to even ask. I don't have anyone else to turn to. I'm... I didn't plan on being a widow twice. It's okay, I'm sorry. Thank you. Sugar, or cream, anything? No. Thank you. You've been doing some redecorating. Yeah. Kind of our way of startin' over. Yeah. Thank you. How are you and the girls holding up? As well as expected. We're all in a bit of shock. Yeah, I'm sure. And I appreciate you taking the time to answer a few more questions. You said your husband was alone the entire weekend. Is that right? Yeah. We had a fight, as I told detective Mason. Bree and I stayed at my friend, Cheryl's. Ashley stayed at her boyfriend's. But you did come home at one point to grab some clothes. Twice, yeah. But you never actually saw your husband? No. See, that's where I'm still a little confused. You said you heard your husband snoring in the bedroom, but you never actually saw him. That's right. But your clothes are in the same bedroom, correct? I had clothes in the laundry room. I never went in the bedroom. Laundry room is... Is where? Downstairs. But I came in through the front door, and then I could hear him snoring from here. He must snore loudly then. Yeah. The bedroom door was... Was closed? When we found him, yeah, it was. But it must've been open when I heard him snoring. I'm sorry, detective. What's the point of all these questions? Do you know anyone who may have threatened David or wanted to do him any harm? No. Of course not. And who's this in this photo here with your daughters? That's my first husband, Michael. And he passed away how many years ago? Six years. Heart attack. I'm very sorry. Why did you ask if someone had recently threatened David? We have reason to believe it may not be a suicide, Mrs. Castor. I'm sorry, what? We're still piecing things together, and I'm not at Liberty to discuss the details. But I will ask you to, um, to come down to the station and submit your fingerprints. My fingerprints? It's more of a process of elimination, Mrs. Castor. And it still might very well be ruled a suicide. But if it's not and somebody intentionally poisoned your husband, we all want to find out who it was. Of course. I'll help any way I can. Hey, I can do the rest if you want. Cheryl, the police are asking more questions. They're not convinced that it was suicide. They think someone might've killed him. What? I know. They won't tell me anything, and I know David killed himself. It's the only thing that makes sense. But they might want to talk to you, okay? Me? Why? About the will. No. They don't know about that. But you worked with him and you knew him. Okay, okay. Gosh, stace. This must just be a terrible mistake. How far should a mother go to protect her daughter? You kidding me with that? There's no way. There are a lot of similarities between David castor and Stacey's first husband. Mike Wallace died of a heart attack. The police report said "no evidence of foul play." And I just read the coroner's report. There was no autopsy. She didn't want one on religious grounds. There's nothing about Stacey castor that comes across as religious. So you think she murdered both of her husbands? The man was 38. Perfect health, some domestic issues, started drinking. She wanted out, he dies. Sound familiar? Reese. There is no evidence that links Stacey castor to any of that. Yet someone used that Turkey baster to poison David castor. He didn't walk down the stairs and put it in the garbage himself. No, but we're supposed to believe that she left it in the garbage? I have seen criminals do stupider things. Look, she was in the house alone with him. Opportunity. He was abusive, motive. Her prints were all over the glass and that baster. She lived there. She cooked, she cleaned. It's not enough. Right. So the best chance we have is to see if the pattern fits. Okay. But it's on you. Great. You have no right to do this. Mrs. Castor, I have a court order signed by a judge. For what possible reason? I can't discuss that at this time. Well, then you can discuss it with my lawyer, because I am going to sue the police, the city, everyone you work with. Wow. What happened, mom? I have a few questions about Stacey castor's first husband. Her first husband? Michael? What was their relationship like? Well, I think that if Michael hadn't have died, I think they would've gotten a divorce. She suspected he was having an affair. And how did his death affect her? It was terrible. Despite all the problems that they were having, Stacey was devastated by it. They all were. Especially Ashley. Ashley and her father were close? No. No, that's what made it so odd. You see, Michael adored Bree. He hardly had any time for Ashley, and she was jealous. She resented him. Well, maybe she felt some guilt because of that. Maybe. But that's what made it so odd and strange. I mean, she was alone with Michael when he died. Now it's happened twice. What do you mean "twice?" I don't think I should answer any more questions. I'm sorry. Miss mcgowan, it's important that you tell me everything you know. Stacey made me swear not to say anything and I promised. I'm sorry you made that promise. But if you are knowingly withholding evidence, you're breaking the law. And you don't want to go down that road. Ashley was in the house with David that weekend. Alone. Well, according to their statements, she was at her boyfriend's house that entire weekend, that was verified by his entire family. Stacey told me that she drove by the house and she saw Ashley leaving. Miss castor. Detective. How are you doing? Thank you for giving US more of your time. Not at all. Sorry about the mess. We are officially closing next week. Well, this will be quick. Mrs. Castor, did you withhold any information about your daughter's whereabouts on the weekend that David died? No. Of course not. Okay, because according to Cheryl mcgowan, you told her that you saw Ashley leaving the house the same night that David passed away. Is this true? She must've misunderstood. Okay, but she was pretty clear that you asked her not to tell anyone. Well, I am at a loss as to how that got taken out of context. What I told Cheryl is that she didn't want to go back to the house ever again. Ashley disliked David immensely. She even threatened him. I did withhold that. I didn't want that getting out and being taken the wrong way. What do you mean, she threatened him? They fought all the time. She's a teenager. You know, she isn't always rational when she loses her temper. Right. And did she ever threaten him in a way that made you feel like she meant it? No. But... you know. I don't know what goes on in someone else's mind. So for the record, you never saw Ashley at the house that weekend? No. These crystals are ethylene glycol. They were taken from the antifreeze on David castor's kidney. Now this is from the first husband, Michael Wallace. Ethylene glycol. The probability is within a statistical certainty. Thank you. So we were right. We? Yes. What are you doing? Jason Peters' dad, is a detective. You know what he told me so that the whole class could hear? That they think dad might've been murdered. Just like David. Both of them were poisoned. Where's Bree? At a friend's. Were you going to tell US, or were we just supposed to see it on the news? I know. I'm sorry. What the hell is going on, mom? They don't even know. They just won't leave it alone. But it's nothing. But listen. They are going to ask you whether you were alone at any time when you were staying at Mark's, and you need to tell them no. I was alone. Mark and his family went to a birthday party. I didn't want to go. For how long? I don't know, five or six hours. Don't tell them that. Why should I lie? I'm trying to protect you. From what? All of this. Just all of this. It's okay. They're not going to find anything. What would they find, mom? What do you think they'd find? Okay, now you're freaking me out. Ashley. Ashley. Baby, it's okay. All of this is okay. We are done speaking of this, all right? I am always going to protect you, no matter what. You know that, right? Right? Do you know that? Yes. Okay. All right. Okay. Now this is not going to help. Why not? It helps you. Fair enough. You know, when I was 18, my mother gave me my first one. She said if a child can die in war at 18, they can have their first drink, too. You turn 18 in a week. Now, I am not naive enough to think you haven't already done this. But I want to make it official with me. Have a seat. My own concoction. And this is the good vodka, not the cheapo stuff David drank. Cheers. Seriously? What? You're too cool to have a drink with your own mother? I don't know, it's just weird. Like I said, we do not speak to anyone about any of this, ever. One for all? All for one. What's wrong with you? Please, don't speak. Either of you. Bree, we are having Ashley's birthday party on Saturday. You could invite some of your friends too if you want. Cool. Can I drink too? No. Good. Ashley, come here. What? I got a surprise for you. Now we can't do this out there, because technically you're still underage. Sweet. Can Mark have one? Better not. I don't want the cops asking me any more questions. Happy 18th. Cheers. Better though? It's not bad. You're the best. Thank you, mom. Aww. Got you! Where have you been? It's my birthday. For once I am actually having fun. Okay. Aren't you happy? No, no, not like this. Screw you, then. Woah, woah, woah! Ash! Hey. Hey. Come on- leave me alone! I don't feel very good. Hey, Bree? Get her up to her room, okay? Ashley, okay baby. You're okay. She's okay. Let her sleep it off. It's okay. You were- I was feeling fine. Ashley, you... you're fine. Just... just go. Bree, will you stay? Why? So you can puke on me? No thanks. Please... What's wrong? I don't know. Just don't leave. Do you miss our other room? No. I really liked it. I didn't mind sharing, honestly. Mom's so different now. She seems happier. She shouldn't be. Why can't you just let her be happy? Let her have this. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I hate myself. Bree, I really don't feel well. Goodnight, Ashley. Can you go wake your sister? She has to be at work in an hour. Mom! Mom! Mom, she's not breathing! Ashley, Ashley, Ashley! Help, mom! What's happening? Wake up! Ashley! Ashley. Wake up, Ashley! Bree, calm down. Calm down, just calm down. Hurry, please! Upstairs. Please. My daughter was drinking last night and I think she took some pills. Please step back. Checking her breathing. Something. Let's load her up. Please hurry. Seventeen-year-old girl found unresponsive. Respiratory rate at 4. Please hurry! Please. Ma'am, you need to wait here. She's my daughter! There's nothing more you can do. The waiting area's around the corner. You need to wait there. Mom, mom. What is that? It's not true. She wouldn't write that. Mom, it's not true! - Bree. - It's not true. Everything's okay. No. It's not her. Listen. It's okay. No, she wouldn't write it. Listen to me. She wouldn't. It's not true. I want you to calm down, okay? Okay. Breathe, just breathe. My god, Stacey. What happened? She's in the emergency room. They don't know if she's going to make it. Why would she do this? Why would she try to kill herself? It was her. What? I was trying to protect her. I didn't know what else to do. No, no, no. I'm here, honey. I'm here, baby. Mrs. Castor. How's Ashley? They don't know yet. Show them the note! Has she confessed to any of what's in this before? No, just that. Any of you? No. Had she ever attempted suicide? She threatened once. She wrote a note then too. Was it printed like this one? Yeah. My sister wouldn't kill herself. She wouldn't hurt anyone. Bree. No, she wouldn't do those things. She did do those things... Mom, maybe you should take her home. No, I'm not going anywhere! Stop it, just stop! Just leave her, it's fine! Bree! Just stop it! Mrs. Castor? What? You can see your daughter now. Not until after we've talked to her. I'm her mother. That's right. Your questions can wait. No, it can't. You have no right! Hey! Sit down. Now. Both of you. Hi, Ashley. Where's my mom? She'll be in soon. We need to ask you a few questions. Would that be all right? What do you remember from last night? Do you remember what pills you took? I didn't take any pills. I only had a few drinks. What drinks? I don't remember. Detective, she's not strong enough for this kind of questioning. Just, just a few more, doc. Ashley, there was an empty prescription bottle next to your bed. You overdosed on those pills, and there was also a note. A note? Can you tell me what was in it? I don't remember writing a note. It was a confession, Ashley. To the murders of your father and David castor. Did you write it? Tell me what you wrote. Tell me what was in the note, Ashley. It's important. Detective. Dear mom, I'm sorry for what I've done. I know the police suspect you of poisoning daddy and David with antifreeze. I can no longer live with the guilt of knowing you might go to jail for something you didn't do. Ashley? Is this all true? Detective! "It was me. "I mixed the antifreeze into their drinks "without them knowing it. "I killed them." Ashley. I'm sorry. No, you don't have to cover for her. I'm not covering for anyone. Detective, that's enough! Look, I know you're scared. Okay. What you're feeling is normal. You'd rather take the blame yourself than to believe she could ever harm you like this. She didn't. She wouldn't do that, she's my mom. She would never do that. Ashley. Tell US the truth, Ashley. This is going to have to wait. Out! Reese. What? "Antifree." What? Look how it's written. It's a typo. The way she told me about that TV special? The way she... Can I see my daughter now? I need to ask you a question. Is that necessary? I'm talking to her. The night your husband died, you said he was drinking vodka. Is that right? Yeah. And I'm sorry, I'm forgetting some of the details. What was mixed with that vodka? You know the answer. My daughter made that quite clear in her confession. Please answer the question. You know the answer! It was mixed with antifree! Antifree. Stacey castor, you are under arrest for the murder of David castor, and for the attempted murder of your daughter, Ashley Wallace. What?! What are you doing? Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Mom? Stay with grandma, okay? Mom! Mom! It's okay honey. Mom! Mom! Grandma. Go get in the car. Why didn't you come and see me? Because you're a liar. I'm not a liar, grandma. Your mother could never do those things, ever. And you think I could? You admitted it. I didn't write that letter! You never want your mother to be happy. Anytime she gets close to someone, you sabotage it. You have to believe me, grandma. My daughter is not a killer. I did not raise anyone who could do those things. It's not your fault. It's not hers, either. Go on, get in the car. She's not going with you. Yes, she is. Bree. Your mother has been asking for you. She needs you. She needs both of US now, more than ever. Grandma, I... Now! She's not going with you! You take your hands off of me! Get your hands off her! This is none of your business. You made it my business. Get the hell out of here. All right? They're both going to stay with my family. Bree can decide for herself. Then let her. No. I'm staying with Ashley. Bree. Just please, I'm not going with you. Can I come in? I'm glad you decided to stay with US. Thank you. Why didn't you go with grandma? I don't know. You have to know that I'm telling the truth. If you're telling the truth, that means mom's lying. I know. Which means she killed dad and David. That means she tried to kill... Come here. I don't want to believe it either. I even thought, "what if I did it and I don't remember?" That's actually what I thought at first at the hospital. She would never do that. She wouldn't. It's mom. She's not mom. She's sick, and we didn't know it. But we still have each other, and we're not going to let her take that away from US. Okay? Bree! Is your mom a killer? Ashley. Did she try to frame you? Did she really do it? Did she? Do you have any comments at all? She's got nothing to say. When was the last time you spoke to your mother? Mr. O'Malley! How you doing? Nervous. The defence is going to try to point the finger at you. Their only chance they have is to create reasonable doubt. Just tell the truth. She'll be there, right? Yes, she will. But she can't hurt you anymore. Be strong. Your father had a nickname for Bree. Is that right? Yeah. But not you. You weren't as close to your father as Bree? No, not really. Did you resent that special bond they had for each other? No. You just said to your friends in the past and in your deposition that it was because of this bond that you formed your own special relationship with your mother. Is that true? I guess. You guess. Did you or did you not think of your mother as your best friend? When we were younger, I... It's a yes or no question. Answer it yes or no. Did you think of your mother as your best friend? Yes. Do you often visit your father's grave? Sometimes. Have you ever said "I'm sorry, daddy" to your father's grave? Not because... Answer it yes or no, and remember, you are under oath. Have you ever said "I'm sorry, daddy" to your father's grave? Yes, but I... Thank you. Ashley, you said your mother served you alcohol on the night of your party. Is that right? Yes. Has this happened before? A few days before my birthday. We were both stressed with everything going on, so my mom made me a vodka drink. How did you like that? It was terrible. I threw up. And how did you like the drinks that were made for you on the night of your birthday party? They were awful. And after you finished those drinks, what happened? I felt sick and disoriented. I went to my room and I passed out. And before you passed out, did you type a suicide note and confession? No. The next thing I knew, I was in the hospital. Did you write this note? No, I did not. Did you poison your father with antifreeze? No, I did not. Did you go to the house at any time during the weekend David castor died? No. Did you poison David castor? No, I did not. No further questions. Ashley? Have you ever threatened suicide before? I wrote a note to an ex-boyfriend. And inside that note you discussed two prior suicide attempts, right? Yes. Ashley, had you ever drank vodka before that day with your mother? No. So you didn't know what it tasted like before that day? No. But it didn't taste like alcohol. But you just said that you'd never had it before. So how could you know? What I'm having a hard time understanding, Ashley, is why, if the drink tasted so horrible as you claim, that you drank it anyway. Because I trusted her. Trusted your mother. Yes. Because she was your best friend, wasn't she? No further questions. I thought she was the one on trial, not me! All they have to do is plant doubt in one juror's mind. That's not going to happen. The jury's going to see right through that attorney. Then they're going to think I'm the one who did it. Just one minute. Ash. What did she tell you then? She said that she saw Ashley leaving the house. Why do you think she would tell you this? Objection. Conjecture. Sustained. Did you give this information to detective Reese when you were questioned? Yes. Do you think Stacey castor knows you are a person who would not lie to the police, therefore expecting that you would divulge that information to shift the blame on Ashley? Objection. Sustained. This is a copy of the suicide note purported to be written by Ashley Wallace. Yes. Can you tell the court, detective Reese, if there is a consistent misspelling anywhere on this document? Yes. The word "antifreeze" is spelled "antifree." Have you ever heard that word mispronounced in that manner before? Yes. Twice. By Stacey castor, during a discussion at the police station and when we arrested her. Detective Reese. I noticed a slight accent. I, I grew up in New York. Could you say the word "strength" for the court, please? "Strenth." "Strenth." is that how your parents said it? Your mother, maybe? Yeah. Is it fair to say that we glean our vernacular from our parents more than anyone else, maybe certain words, maybe subconsciously misspelling certain words, if we've heard it pronounced in a particular way by our parents our whole life. Is that possible? I suppose that's possible, yes. And as far as the fingerprints on the glass of antifreeze is concerned, isn't it true that Mrs. Castor's fingerprints were found everywhere in the house, since she lived there? Yeah. The defence calls its next witness, Stacey castor. Raise your right hand, please. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god? I do. Mrs. Castor, did you love your first husband? With all my heart. I still do. I still miss him. And David castor? He changed my life. I never thought I would be happy again. I loved him very much. Was Ashley happy that you remarried? No. She and David did not get along. He was hard on her, and I blame myself for that. I should not have put Ashley in that situation. What situation? She felt she had no way out. Mrs. Castor, do you love your daughter? With all my heart. Both of them. But you did have a special place in your heart for Ashley, correct? We were best friends. Your daughter was in her bedroom for 17 hours after going to bed the night before feeling that sick. Is that normal, Mrs. Castor? For Ashley to be in her room, 17 hours? Yes. And the next time you saw your daughter was when you found her unresponsive and drooling in her bed. Is that right? Yes. My god. You lost two husbands to poisoning. Your daughter is drooling in her bedroom. Is this really your testimony? Your prints were on the Turkey baster. They were on the glass next to the bed. No one else's. Not Ashley's, not even your dead husband's. You were in the house that weekend, you were there, no one else. And when the police got too close, you poisoned your own daughter, then you typed that letter to frame her. Didn't you? No. You're lying, Mrs. Castor. Objection. Sustained. No. I'm not lying. If mom's found not guilty, will I have to go live with her? Probably. Will they arrest you, then? Why would they arrest me? Well, if mom didn't do it... Bree. She did it. Even if the jury doesn't think she did it. I don't want to go live with her. You're amazing, you know that? I do know that. But why do you think so? Because you love mom, and you know she loves you despite everything. I thought you would believe anything she said. I mean, I did. You were going to take the blame for her, and she was going to let you. How could she do that? I don't know. Hey Ashley, Bree. Why are you here already? The jury's still out. We wanted to be here just in case. Well, you girls take care, okay? Jury's back. Would the defendant please rise? On count one, murder in the second degree, in the death of David castor, how do you find the defendant? Guilty. On count two, attempted murder in the second degree, how do you find the defendant? Guilty. On count three, offering a false instrument in connection to the forgery of David castor's will, how do you find the defendant? Guilty. I hate my mother for ruining so many people's lives. What gave her the right to play god with people? I never knew what hate was until now. Even though I do hate her, I still love her at the same time. That bothers me, and it's so confusing. How can you love someone and hate them at the same time? She was my best friend, and she took that all away just because she got scared. I was scared too when I was in the hospital all by myself, and I wanted my mom, but she was the one who did this. This will be my last chance to say goodbye. As horrible as it makes me feel, this is goodbye mom. I know you're sick, and I know that isn't all your fault. I know that sickness also comes from your own mother who even now cannot see the truth. As hard as the two tried to break me, I survived, and I will survive, and I will not become like you. I'm going to do good things in this world, despite making me and Bree, in every sense of the word, orphans. In all my years in the criminal justice system, I've seen murderers of every variety and stripe. What you did to David castor can only be described as premeditated torture. As bad and evil as that was, what you tried to do to your daughter is simply something I cannot comprehend. You, Mrs. Castor, are in a class all by yourself. I'm going to impose the maximum sentence I'm allowed. 51 and one third years. Court is adjourned. No one won today. No one. You still maintain that David got the idea to kill himself from a news magazine segment about... A woman who killed her husband using antifree. But not just one, but two husbands. Have you thought about the irony that this is a news program about a woman who killed her two husbands with antifreeze? No. This is a program about a woman who was accused of killing them. Convicted. It doesn't mean she did it.
