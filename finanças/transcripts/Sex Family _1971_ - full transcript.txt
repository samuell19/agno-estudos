KOKUEI COMPANY PRESENTS Father, are you going to take a rest now? Yes, as usual. I see. How is everyone doing today? Yes, as usual. I see. Were there any problems? No, nothing at all. - That's good, then. - Indeed. There is no problem whatsoever. There is no problem whatsoever... There will never be any problem with this, right? Yeah... There is no problem whatsoever. Everything seems to be going according to the plan. There will be no problem. There is no problem whatsoever. There is no problem whatsoever. Mother, you have lived long enough. Hurry up... kill me! Mother! You can die now, and my brothers will continue to live in agony. I beg you... hurry up! Quick, kill... kill me! Thank you. I won’t die. I cannot die! Mother, were you happy? I won't die... There is no problem whatsoever. SEX FAMILY The Makers Izuru Deguchi Hideo Ito Tamaki Katori Miki Hayashi Yoko Muto Junko Miyashita Joji Ichimura Hiroshi Yajima Takeshi Shima Hiroshi Imaizumi Koji Wakamatsu Sakae. Everything. The whole world. On the other hand, my mother died because she couldn't stand my father. Etsu! Then, my older brother. Me. And my younger brother. Then, there was his mistress. Her daughters, Akiko, Natsuko, Haruko. The three of them! All of them are my father’s women! He made his mistress’ three daughters his mistresses also. His way of dominating the world is simple and forceful. On the surface, he has fame and status... as the Commander-in-Chief, but, in reality, he is the boss of a monkey family. All males and females have to obey him. My older brother and I... shared our father's women and enjoyed sex in the house. My mother lost her mind and died. I did nothing. My mother died because I did absolutely anything. I killed my mother! The one who made mother kill herself... was me! Go away! How dare you? Why did you tell me that you would die if I didn’t come? Why did you tell me you killed your mother? If you were that sad, why didn't you attend her funeral? At the funeral, you should have told everyone about our father, that your mother committed suicide, and that our father was the reason! Shut up, you mistress’ child! That's right. I am indeed a mistress’ child, but I attended the funeral on behalf of the real wife's oldest son, and even came here for you because you told me that you would die. I see, sister... no, Akiko. Let's run away! Run away? Why did my mother die? My older brother and I... No, you are also a member of the prestigious Sakae family, but, in reality, you are nothing but father's puppet. If we don't do anything, we will continue to rot like this. We will all continue to be his puppets. You will become our father's and my older brother's toy! Idiot! Yes, I am an idiot. But that's because I love you so much! Stop it! I won't stop anymore. I don't care you are my father's mistress or my older brother's wife. I fell in love with you at first sight. I have been waiting for this very moment. Stop it! This is not what you told me! Let's leave the house. It's not just running away from our father. Let's become independent, and prove that we can have our own self-reliant lives. Let's start over. Let's change everything! That kind of... That kind of dream... - I don't have it anymore. - This is not a dream! It is our own life. Stop! I can't do that anymore. Why? Why can't you do it? Stop it. We shouldn't... We shouldn't! We shouldn't! We shouldn't! We can't! We can't! I didn't have any dream. I didn't know why I did all those things. At any rate, I was hopeless at that time. That was my youth. I didn't really love anyone. I lived an agonizing life without any dreams. At any rate, I visited him because I thought he could find a solution for me. Have your mother and sisters been fine? Give this to your mother. You are now a university student. Focus on your studies. You see... I am not really a university student. I am a mistress’ daughter! And today... I am going to quit being one! Akiko! What are you...? When I saw his face, I... I couldn't lie to myself that I was not a mistress’ daughter. What do you think you can do? Either I became a mistress’ daughter fully, or I'd quit being one as an independent woman. If you hate being a mistress’ daughter... the only solution would be to become a mistress yourself. You will become my mistress today. I... will not! Somehow, I didn't show any resistance. No... Even if I had resisted, I would have been just too weak to do that... since I was only a girl. When I realized that, I decided to become a mistress, rather than a mistress’ daughter. Don't cry. I am not crying. Stop! Do you plan to make me a mistress too? What are you staring at? That's right. Our father sold me to your older brother already. Okay, let's end this. No! You know that's not possible! Why are you here? I am asking why you are here. Mother committed suicide. Mother... was killed by you! Is that so? Of course! Well, perhaps you're right. I might have killed her. She might have killed herself. I don’t think about people once they’re dead. She ran away from me, anyway. So, I decided to forget about her. That's false! This is your usual, fake way of doing things. You are avoiding the truth. Stop being deceitful! Is there something wrong? During the funeral, I slept with a man today. It was Koji, wasn’t he? That’s right. You are good at guessing. I would happily sleep with him. I felt I was almost being, raped, though. He tackled me suddenly. It was such a crazy situation. You see, I have never seen him that angry. I am serious! His eyes were completely red. He almost sucked my nose. I'm not laughing of that. What's wrong? Did something happen? No, it's not that. I just have been thinking about everyone recently. Everyone living in this house. I think you are attracted to Koji. Why don’t you go have fun with Koji tonight? In other words, considering the male and female combinations, father and Haruko will become a couple as usual, even more openly than before. According to the current custom, the order is from the top going down. Therefore, Natsuko and Shozo will soon become a couple. In summary, I can be alone... and finally leave this house. It's been a while since you visited my room. Didn't you come here to do me? I guess... I'm fine with that. I guess your medicine dose has increased. A little. Do you want to leave this house with me? Let's see... I am being serious. I am fed up of everything here. I know, me too. But it's been five years since I got stuck in this room. I think it's time for you to get some fresh air outside. Fresh air... The blue sky... The blue ocean... A white sand beach... That's good! It's fine, isn't it? What do you think? Let’s leave now. No matter how hot the sun is, staying here is not much different. And I bet the wind outside will be cold. I am going back to my workplace. Come, let's go together. Come, let's go back! Everyone is waiting for us. I have to do something before that. My father made them release me on the same day. Our comrades might think I am a spy! I will tell you about it later! It must have been hard, Natsuko. Father, you pulled a dirty trick. I am different from my sisters! Father, let’s make it clear. I don't want to become a mistress like my sisters. You cannot control me with your power! This is exactly the mistress’ life I imagined. How dare you live like this, sister? This is not different from being a pig! You might think you can dominate everything in this world. It's nothing but a bourgeois’ vanity! I will pay you back everything later. I don't want to see your face again. Farewell! When are you going to pay me back, then? Why don't you pay me back now? In other words, you will never be able to pay me back. So, do you want me to become your mistress too? Well, I wonder about that? Say it clearly! I don't know what you mean by the word “mistress". Considering that you are my daughter, being taken care of by me, you should become one. I understand. Then, take as much as you have provided until now! It's not a big deal for me! I am only throwing away this 19-year-old body and life. I will use my life for more precious goals later. Father. I am afraid to say I'm not a virgin anymore. You stay here. The one who dominates and the one who is dominated. This world consists of the two of them. I... I don't just own the things I dominate. I don't just love the things I dominate. You all exist because I am here. You, the ones who are dominated, exist before me, the one who dominates. Take up, the starved people! Now, the day will be soon! Wake up, my comrades! The sun has already risen! In the day we can off the tyrannical chains, The Red Flag burns with our bloods! We're distantly separated by the seas, But let's go together joining hands! Let's battle with... I wonder if I despise myself? That's what I live for. I am a dying woman. A dying woman cannot be revived. Nobody wants a impotent woman digging her own grave. But... I wonder how death... feels like? Damn it! I won't be a block of a sex pyramid forever! Those people... I absolutely won't do it with them! Shit... I'm in pain! Pain... Good morning! Have a good day. At the prosecutor’s office, they were joking that you were planning a coup, father. Indeed. Well, that kind of rumor circulates... because of that incident and the low volume of criminal cases at hand. Indeed. There is no smoke without fire. I am actually considering it. Huh? You can't possibly be a virgin, right? Do you have sex with our father every night? It's natural because the two of you share the same blood. You are going to become a pig soon too. Do you like our father? Since I was born, I was raised to become a mistress. I am destined to be our father's mistress. Nice to meet you. My father is persistent! Okay. Let's go. That's good. Alright. That's nice. Good. That's it. Alright. Sit like that. Good. Relax now. Good. Okay. Well... Look to the left. This way. Good. Brother! Now, smile. - Do you take this kind of photos? - I do. I need them for gynecological reasons. Spread your legs please. That's it. Keep smiling. Good. Brother, our mother didn't commit suicide. I killed her. Huh? What did you just say? I killed our mother. What?! I saw her suffering in the middle of an attempted suicide. So, I thought she had chosen to kill herself, that she was happier dying, rather than living like she did. So, I helped her. That's enough! If you are here to talk nonsense, leave already. And be sure to get some sleep. Your eyes are red. That idiot makes me sick. I am serious. I strangled her with my own hands. And then? Our mother was having a nightmare. And she got naked while she was suffering. Then, I... You raped and killed her, right? Yes... That's matricide and I am going to get capital punishment, right? Brother, can you prosecute me? Get me arrested and prosecuted right now! Since our mother died, you've been behaving a bit strangely. I will think about it. Wait at home for now. Yes! I can't believe this. Was he really serious just now? First, this kind of thing couldn't have happened in our house. Second, there is no motive for a murder at all. Impossible! Such a thing would be ridiculous! Nobody believes that I did it. I wonder if I was wrong? I shouldn't have killed mother, but those pigs instead! Are you pregnant? I see. Our father's or my brother's? Whose child is it? Your brother's... You are nothing but a useless baby pig. Is she dead? You pig! Who is it? What do you want? I didn't know you were a good man. If you are here to sleep with me, then you are wrong. I am different from my father and brothers. Is that so? That's unfortunate. I thought you wanted a woman too. - Why are you here? - For nothing. Actually, I want to talk. You see, your mother did not commit suicide. In fact, the one who killed your mother was... It was me. It was me! It's the truth. I gave Natsuko sleeping pills to your mother... because she said she couldn’t sleep well. So, I made her die that way. She took 40 pills, and it was an attempted suicide. She took 50 pills in total. And it was me who made her take the remaining 10 pills. - That was what killed her. - No way! I'm pretty convinced that mother was happier dying... rather than being treated as a dirty mistress. Your mother was dirty too. She wasn't! She was different from you! What are you talking about? All of the women have been raped by our father. Our behaviors and thoughts... Your father controlled everyone! Shut up, you whore! Yes, I am a whore! Shit! You have lost your mind. You didn't have any reason to kill my sisters. I did, I sure did! Women cannot understand it. Hey, Haruko! Yes, there is no problem whatsoever. I don't want to tell anyone, including the police, about this. My sisters’ deaths don't even make me feel sad. I am totally fine, because I am able to live my own life. I am different from you. I will continue to stick to father. Father... What happened? Was there any problem? There is no problem whatsoever. Nothing at all. Katana. The katana isn't here! No, there is no problem, as usual. Silence! There is! Damn you! - You took it. - Father. Do you really need this? No, it's fine... You see, I borrowed this... to kill my sisters. Father, I... I was wrong, after all. I have killed my mother and sisters now. I was wrong, after all! Anyone can be wrong. There are various ways to correct yourself. But what you need right now... is to know how I'll absolve your mistake. You're wrong, father! I am not talking about that. I am here to... And I believe I have been right all along. I am not talking about that! I came here. Here, here! I came to sit here! You... Shit! I... I... I didn't come to just sit here! How dare you judge me? Are you that scared of a murderer? You, my brothers... all of you want to sit here, don’t you? But you just couldn't defeat our father. However... the one who is sitting here right now is me! I am sitting here! THE END
