(roaring) ** (speaking in Filipino) We will not rest until we destroy the plantations. We will attack! Avenge the blood of our brothers! To this, I pledge my life. Are you with me? (shouts of support) (shouting in Filipino) (shouting together) ** ** (church bell tolling) ** We'll bring back enough ammunition from Manila to pay them back. ** Bye, Cindy-- don't worry about us. Now you're not gonna start agreeing with Bart, are you? You'll be safer in Manila. Oh no, I'll be back with Bart and your precious Mr. Dickson. Let's not kick it around anymore, huh? Take care of yourself, Dad. Keep the men on four-hour watches right around the clock until I get back, huh? Just in case. Goodbye. Goodbye, Dad. (captain shouting orders in Filipino) (ship bell rings) (engine starts) (ship horn blowing) Lucio, take over. Yes, sir. (man announcing on PA) Northwest Orient Airlines international flight number 4, arriving from Seattle, Anchorage and Tokyo. Welcome to Manila, folks. Paging Mr. Dickson-- Mr. Greg Dickson-- Please report to the ticket counter. Thank you. You page Dickson? Yes, your party, sir. Yes, that is a party. Mr. Dickson, I'm very glad you're here. Glad to be here. Tell the Northwest Service I'll have to cross the International Date Line more often. Where are the rest of your things? Would you like an inventory? I've got a sleeping bag at a construction camp on the Colorado River, a change of shirts at a boarding house in Seattle-- I see. We were expecting something a little different. We? You-- uh, part of a team? I'm from the plantation. I used to work for your father. Never figured he'd hire anybody but a man. Let's just pretend I am a man, hm? Nobody has that much imagination. ** Hey, ever ride in a kalesa? Look, we're due to sail in less than an hour. No gasoline fumes, no harsh grinding of the gears, This seems to be an educated beast. When he gets near the Hotel Manila park, he can outrun Man o' War. Let's go. Pier seven, and hurry. ** And no detours. ** Too bad we don't have time to do the town. Now, if I hadn't known you so long, I'd-- I'd suspect you didn't like me. Driver, can you go a little faster, please? Always throw yourself at men like that? I don't believe I've properly introduced myself. No, as a matter of fact, you haven't. I'm Mrs. Rogers. Mrs.-- ? You mean Bart's wife? (chuckling) Well, I'll be. You know, when I left these parts, he was just a kid, still throwing rocks at girls. Well, some kids grow up. Yeah. Guess I came home too late. I guess you did. Too late for your father's sake, anyway. I'm not talking about that. Look, your father was shot to death by the Huks just two weeks ago and-- Yeah? Never mind. Driver, please hurry. ** Salamat. ** Hi, Bart. Welcome home. Thanks. Sorry about your dad, Greg. Yeah, sure, sure. He'd changed a lot these last few years. For better or worse? We weren't sure you'd get our cable. Stubborn people, Western Union. Always get their man. Found me in a poker game up near Salem, Oregon. Where have you been hiding all these years? Oh, here and there-- building bridges. They put 'em in the strangest places. Some of them almost as far away as Paoli. Paoli's been good to us. Now it'll be good to you. Yeah, that's what the lawyers in San Francisco said-- $2 million worth of good. Hey, is old Pinote still skipper? No, he died a while back. Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. Young Pinote's taken over. I'll go up and surprise him-- see you later. (Bart) Cindy's staying in Manila. Bart! Now look, I told you you were staying here. Bart, that's not fair. The embassy will find a place for you to stay. I'll come back for you as soon as it's safe... if you still want me. Darling, I'm your wife! It's important that we be together. Important for me? Or important for you? Important for both of us. Look. I owe you too much already. (ship horn blowing) Bye, Cindy. Take care of yourself. Bart-- Please let me go with you. ** ** For sharks? For Huks. Part of a handy kit? They might come in very handy. Bunch of idiots running around the hills with rusty bolo knives and you packing a set of .50 calibers-- like swattin' flies with a pile driver. Good morning! Hi, good morning. Everything all right, darling? Yeah, so far. What's all this Huk business do to real estate values on Paoli? Well, don't look so shocked. There'll be plenty for everybody if we can unload that plantation before we have to hold a fire sale. Think I'll go out and check the forward gun. My, how eccentric of you. Eccentric? Making your own cigarettes. Even cowboys buy them by the carton these days. You always so critical early in the morning? (chuckling) Where's Bart? Went up forward to check the guns. Guess I upset him. Told him I was gonna sell the plantation. Now don't tell me that upsets you, too. (sailor shouting) Lancero Point! What's the alarm about Lancero Point? They feel there's a concentration of Huks there. Let me take over. ** 7,000 islands out there. That's a lot of islands. No way of telling which ones the Huks are on. (gunshot firing) (gunfire ricocheting) (machine gun firing) (gunfire continues) (speaking Filipino) (gunfire exchange stops) Thanks. (gunshot firing) (machine gun firing) Bart! (Greg) Bart! Bart! Easy, boy. Easy. The Huk shoot's over. I remember the day you wouldn't even play with a cap gun. (Cindy) Leave him alone. He needs a shot of brandy and so do I. ** (ship horn blowing) ** Good to see ya. 14 years. Yeah, 14 years. Sure good to see ya. I was askin' the skipper about you just this morning. "They crated the old man away yet?" I asked him. Not a chance. Sure look wonderful. Got the guns aboard, Dad. 50 surplus rifles, four machine guns, plenty of ammunition and some dynamite. (Dad) Good. Major Balatbat just arrived here with a platoon. He's got a theory the Huks intend to burn a path right through the cane. (Major Balatbat) Hello, sir. How are you, Major? How are you? This is Greg Dickson, Major. Major. My sympathy, sir, for the death of your father. They tell me there's war going on here, Major. One platoon, huh? That the extent of your army on Paoli? We are spread a little thin, as you can see. There's so many islands and so many sugar centers. I'm afraid your plantation's just one of them, sir. No hard feelings, Major. I don't know your plans for that little group, but they tell me I got a pretty valuable piece of real estate. I mean to defend it. Are you armed, sir? No. May I suggest you wear side arms at all times. It would be a feather in his cap if Kalak, who killed your father, would also kill you. Kalak? He's still in the area, I'm sure of that. Don't be like Mr. Rogers here. I've heard that the tobacco used by Mr. Rogers is very deadly. But still, not much for Kalak's trigger. Hello, Dad. Told you I'd be back. Bart's gonna stay and help unload. Hello, Major. Mrs. Rogers. I'll be around, Mr. Dickson. I feel you're most excellent bait. Anytime, Major. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. ** Forgot to knock, old man. Where are your knuckles? You've got some people around here fooled with that mask you're wearing. Not me. I helped raise you. Bart tells me you've been building real ones. Yeah, I've had some jobs here and there. Still as footloose as ever? More so. Last we heard from you was when we cabled you about your mother. Yeah. Your father spent a lot of time sitting in that chair. He wouldn't let anything in here be touched. Comes a little late, doesn't it? Always the same old trouble. Too little, too late. When I was a kid, you and old man Pinote gave me something-- time. Time's the biggest gift a grownup can give a kid. Your father was busy building an empire. Yeah, Yeah, no time. ** ** Excuse me, old man, I think I'll take a swim. Hey, remember the time you jumped in after me, clothes and all? Did I ever thank you for it? Of course you did. ** ** You surprised me. Oh? I thought you'd be out beating on doors by now, getting bids for your empire. Shows you don't know engineers. Always make a survey, I was taught. Sort of look the property over. You mind if I go ahead with my swim? No, no, go ahead. ** Keep a straight knee! Rotor more from the hip! ** I can keep this up as long as you can. How 'bout we sit the next one out? (laughing) Okay. ** You know, for a swimming instructor, you didn't last very long. Don't get in the water much anymore. My business, I work above the water. First bridge I ever worked on was the Tacoma Narrows Bridge-- Gallopin' Gertie, they called her. I remember it was on one of these hot afternoons-- something like today-- I was walking across this 17-1/2 inch cable about 6,000 feet long and 450 feet above the water. The narrows look like one of those aluminum griddles-- the kind you cook flapjacks on. Well, I was about halfway-- You fell 450 ft. into the frying pan and that's why you hate people today. Now hold on, Mrs. Rogers. I don't hate people. I just don't let 'em get me down. You know, you never expect anything from anybody, you got no problem. You must be very happy with you. The only thing that never lets you down is a fact or a formula, like the truss arch, 91-strand cable or a cantilever or-- Do you love him? You do realize that that's none of your business. Oh, I don't know about that. Bart and I are very old friends. We grew up together. He even liked my father. But I'll withdraw the question. ** Look out! ** (crickets chirping) Well, they tell me you're going to live. I may have to give up weight lifting for a day or two and push-ups before breakfast, but I think I'll make it. I'm sure you can manage with one arm. What you need is a good night's sleep. On a hot night like this? You learn how in the islands. Oh? And just how do you get sleep? You'd never guess. I'd like to try. An old music box-- Brahms. It plays me to sleep. How eccentric of you. Maybe you'll loan it to me when I get restless. Good night, Mr. Dickson. Goodnight, Mrs. Rogers. (crickets chirping) How's Greg? That was Greg, wasn't it? How old would you say he is? Well, when he was sent stateside to finish college, he was 19. That was 14 years ago. You'd think in all those years he'd have learned something about morals. What? Don't misunderstand me. I'm only talking about what makes him tick. I don't know. He has no give. It's all take. Cindy, I'm gonna mention this for the last time. I want you to leave. The first thing in the morning, as soon as Pinote can shove off. And I'm going to ask you not to mention it again. I told you I'm staying right here with you. Are you that curious about him? That's the last thing you have to worry about. I don't think so. Oh now, Bart, don't be ridiculous. You don't know how deep worry can go, Cindy. Yes, I do. I never want you to know. It's the war, Bart. The old war, and now this new war. I'm talking about us-- About how you feel being-- being married to me and-- Bart. (whispers) Please. I'm sorry. You better turn in now. Goodnight. Goodnight. ** (music box playing Brahms's Lullaby) ** Just because I was lucky enough to kill him, why should I attend his funeral? Watch the faces carefully, especially those who look very sad. (digging) These are our people. They work here. What do they know about the Huk? Mr. Dickson, your swimming companion with the knife-- he worked for you too. Oh? Then Mr. Kalak has made some converts in our own backyard. Not many. A few. Most are loyal. Major, just what's your pitch? Why do you want me out here? Don't you remember? You're my bait. You think somebody would take a pot shot at me right here at the funeral? Oh, come now, Major. Not even the Huks are that crazy-- not with your men around here. You do not know the Huks, Mr. Dickson. No. No, but I'm learning fast. ** The Huks demanded money and rice to fight our government. That was Kalak's price for not burning the central. Your father told him to come for it personally. Then he set an ambush for Kalak. It did not succeed. But it was a brave thing to try. He was long on bravery. You've been gone many years. You're-- how do you say-- rusty about the things important to the Filipino. I'm here to sell this outfit and fly home with a suitcase full of importance. Does that sicken you, Major? Who will defend the people who live here? Who worked your land all these years? You, Major. You will. With what? With one company? ** In the United States, do you read much of our leader Magsaysay? He hasn't knocked the World Series off the front page, but I've heard of him. Face-to-face, he has talked to every soldier in our army. And he teaches what I first learned in your country when I took my training at Fort Benning: That all free men are brothers. Look, Major, I'm getting tired of being the heavy around here. I didn't bring my flag this trip. I'm an engineer, not a guy on horseback. I like the feel of 50s in my palm. Does that sum it up for you? Whether you like it or not, Mr. Dickson, on this side of the world we are all playing for larger stakes than your plantation. Your country and mine have been together a long time. We're going to stay that way. Yeah. Guess I'm getting soft, Major, but I admire you, in my own limited way. Good luck. It is you, Mr. Dickson, who will need the good luck. ** ** Ramirez! (speaking Filipino) ** ** Ah, that's a pretty slick piece of machinery. How long do you think it would take to get a firm offer on this place? From Hong Kong or the Americans? First come, first serve. Hong Kong-- overnight. The others, a little longer. All this Huk business, do you think that would hold us up any? The other outfits are in the same boat. So long as the Huks don't destroy our machinery or burn down the cane, it won't affect bidding. Well, whoever it is, get on it. Money is money. The people, Greg-- they prefer Americans managing the place. Just how do you know that? Did you ever really ask them? Maybe they prefer chop suey to hamburgers. These cars, they make them easy on the eyes nowadays, don't they? Real low and slinky. When I left the States, our cars stood right up where you could see 'em. Straight and proud they stood. You know something, old man? You never bought a round trip ticket anywhere in your life. You think that's wrong? Yeah. Look, we'll go back together. You know anything I get you're part of it. You've served your term. Let's put the whole works on the block and we'll get rid of it and get out of here. Now I can't promise you a Stanley Steamer, but when we hit San Francisco there's one thing I can promise you, and that's the longest, sleekest looking automobile you've ever seen in your life. I'm grateful, Greg, but I just couldn't do it. Why? Well, I admit that I've thought about going back. For 45 years I've thought about it, off and on. I've followed the ads. I know that buildings are taller. Some of 'em real tall. I know they've sort of cleaned the doo-dads off things back in the States. But I came here in 1907. Me and a boatload of other schoolteachers. Had a nice new teaching credential and a mind full of high purpose-- help the people. That's what I came here to do. Not with a gun. Not with the Good Book either. But with quinine, and clean drinking water, and the three "R"s. We did a fine job too. A job to be proud of. Got the illiteracy rate down below 50%, cleaned up cholera and the plague, and taught folks to hold up their heads and look a man straight in the eye. You think anyone appreciates what you did? Or remembers? Yes, yes, I do. You know, Americans have a wonderful ability to win friends. They have a nice smile, they're simple and honest. I'm still an American, Greg. I'd like to do more than just win friends. I'd like to keep them. You gonna handle this sale, or do I? I'm working for you now, I'll handle it. All right, fine. Greg. No matter who buys the place, I'm staying here. I have no choice. Don't put me in that kind of spot, old man. I've got plenty of bumps on my conscience already without pulling the rug out from under your feet. I'm sorry, son. Yeah. Yeah. ** (speaking Filipino) ** ** (fire crackling) (crashing and rumbling) Get more men on this fire! (gunshots firing) (gunshot firing) Just what's he trying to get out of his system? I remember when he was a kid he wouldn't even pull the wings off of a butterfly. There's lots of things you don't know about, Greg. Yeah, for instance? Remember Bart and I spent three years at Santo Tomás concentration camp. You don't know what it means-- Bad food, solitary confinement, burning fever. You don't know what it can do to a man. If Bart had known last November 12th what he knows now, things would be different. What's November 12th? The day he and Cindy got married. Go on. You can tell me. He can never be a husband to Cindy. Not a real husband. Major was right. (reading) "People of Paoli, rise up and join us. "Strike now. "The blood of young Dickson must water the earth, "which is rightfully yours. "Kalak." Kalak writes a lousy fan letter. It's a real yack. What are you gonna do about it? I'm gonna keep him from pouring kerosene over this joint until your father here can get me a certified check for it. And let Kalak get away with this? Okay, so I'm his number one pigeon. But if you think I'm going out and challenge him with native spears at ten paces, you're nuts. Let's get out of here. ** (speaking Filipino) ** Is this everybody? Yeah. Well, you all know what happened earlier this evening. And they may try it again. So we're going to give each one of you men either a rifle or a pistol. (men murmuring) (Greg) Each one of our regular guards will take three men. I want every station covered. Two men will sleep while two men stand guard. You'll be on two-hour shifts. Two on and two off until daybreak. All right, Bart, give 'em the guns. (crowd murmuring) Somebody got some questions? What about our families? Who will defend them? What about our homes? Huks don't care about your homes. All they wanna do is destroy the one thing on this island that means anything-- This! How do you think you'd live? Where would you earn money for your families if it weren't for these machines? Now look, I'm sorry you're mixed up in this, but whether we like it or not, Kalak wants to make an example of this plantation. Now our one chance is to stand firm. Together. Get the guns. These aren't people to you. They're just so many guns. We're living in a .50-caliber generation, Mrs. Rogers. People are only as good as their aim. Ask your husband. He's pretty sharp with the trigger department. You never let up, do you? Okay, so I was rough on 'em. This is their life. This place has fed them and clothed them. What about their wives and children? The Huks won't bother them. God and Mr. Kalak willing! Looks like it'll line up okay. Fine, I'll take the first watch. What about me, Commodore? You get some rest. Bart, I think you'd better take your bride up to one of our air-conditioned suites. I suggest the third floor. We'll call you when your watch starts. Don't worry, I'll keep in touch. Hope you brought your music box. Greg. Now look-- I said I'd call you when we needed you. Thanks, but this isn't a night for sleep. Goodnight. Greg! This place has been good to me. You understand? Sure, sure, old man, anything you say, sure. I'd like to have half a dozen men to go with me to the village. Look, the village is in no danger. What would they want with a row of grass shacks? One of us-- an American-- should be there. Look, old man, there's one thing on this island that's not expendable, and that's you. Now you get up there and find yourself a nice place and go to sleep. Goodnight. Goodnight. (Greg) All right, men! Take your stations! Cindy. How did Greg know about the music box? I told him. Isn't that a fairly personal subject? I don't think it's all that personal. Come on, hm? ** ** (clattering) (gunshot firing) (guerillas laughing) (gunshot firing) ** (gunshot) (machinery humming) Like one of these? Now that you're awake, I think it's about time I asked you a few direct questions. Like what? Like, where'd you come from? How'd you get to Paoli? You know, things in that category. You have a particularly poor sense of timing. When you're standing two-hour watches on and off, you have to make the offs count. Where'd you meet Bart? At the embassy in Manila-- a garden party. Love at first sight, huh? I was a secretary working at the embassy-- very fast, too. Fast? 90 words a minute. (chuckling) How'd you get way out here? Wanted to see the world, till I ran out of money in Manila. Now, what else would you like to know? We haven't even begun to scratch that beautiful surface yet. Ever miss the States? Got nobody to miss there. Both my parents are dead. I have a cousin who lives in Monterey, but-- I guess this is my home now. I was talking to Stephen. He told me about Bart-- A lot of things I didn't know about him. I feel sorry for both of you. Just wanted you to know that. You know, I think I will take one of those things now. Oh, fine. ** ** ** (gunshots firing) (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunshots firing) (train approaching) (gunshot firing) (gate crashing) (gunshot firing) (gunshot) (gunshot) Bart!

(gunfire continuing) ** (machine gun firing) (armored truck rumbling) ** (orders in Filipino) ** ** (Major) Someone covered him with our flag. Mr. Rogers would like that. He was an American, but he was one of us, too. You wanted to play with a new toy, old man. Why? What did you ever know about guns? Why didn't you stick to your pipe and tobacco? Quinine? Your three "R"s? Boy, I'll bet you really tore into 'em, like a real killer. Were you fast on the draw? Blinking behind those glasses? Did you ask their pardon before you fired? Why'd you do it, old man? Why? (tearfully) Why would you do a thing like that? Now you've gone and spoiled everything. Why didn't you leave the shooting to Bart and to me? (gun clatters) ** (crying) You were right, old man-- So right! (sobbing) About so many things. You and your one-way ticket. ** Maybe I'll stay awhile too. Till there are no more clocks on your island. Would you like that, old man? (sobbing) Guess you can use another man, Major. I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. You and your people must evacuate this island now. The entire village is going-- what's left of them. I'm not gonna run-- not now, Major. Perhaps you didn't hear me, Mr. Dickson. You were in the army. This is an order. Kalak is set to attack in force. You will assume immediate charge of Pinote's ship. Get the men, women and children aboard her. With luck, you can make Manila by morning. I'll be back on the first boat. Good luck to you, Major. God be with you, Mr. Dickson. ** We'll see to it that he gets a proper burial. ** ** (crickets chirping) Today we were beaten. Tomorrow we will win. (cheering in unison) At dawn, we will attack them with more guns. More men from many islands will join us. We have tasted our last defeat.
