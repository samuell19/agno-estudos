(charming music) - Lassie! Lassie! Lassie! Lassie! Lassie, where are you? - [Roddy] There's something that's always fascinated me, and that's why Lassie has retained this sort of affection? Lassie is a movie star on the level, let's say, of Bette Davis or Katharine Hepburn. (chuckles) - [Robert] Lassie is the things that people remember, the things that were good. Not the things that were bad. - [Margaret] By watching the Lassie movie, it kind of brings out the best in one's nature. It is a half-fairy tale, but half real life. - [Janet] We see a pureness. We see an innocence. We see qualities in Lassie that we hope are in us. (upbeat music) - I'm June Lockhart, and for over six years I played the role of Ruth Martin on television's Lassie show. And on many a day I was out here at the Disney Golden Oak Ranch, north of Hollywood, filming exteriors. Every Sunday night at seven o'clock, we came into homes across the country on CBS. Jon Provost as Timmy, Hugh Reilly as my husband, and most important there was our collie, Lassie. We were supposed to be a pretty typical, middle-America family, but in one very important way we were very different. Because in our home, and in all the 17 years that were was a Lassie program on network television, Lassie was never just a pet. Lassie participated, she solved problems, she saved people, she saved her fellow animals. And for over 50 years in the United States and in countries around the world, audiences have watched and cared about the adventures of a collie. A collie like no other, Lassie. (exciting music) It all started in 1938 with a short story by Eric Knight that appeared in the Saturday evening post. It appealed to so many readers that two years later, Knight enlarged the story into a novel. By 1943, in the midst of World War II, Lassie Come Home had become a major motion picture. It featured such veteran actors as Donald Crisp and Edmund Gwenn, and a wonderful child actor, Roddy McDowall. But the star of the film would be an unknown, unheralded collie going by the name of Pal. - My father, he'd been working for MGM. They knew of his reputation. He'd done quite a few things. And he was hired with his dog Pal to be a stand in for MGM's dog that was to play Lassie. (inspiring music) And we knew what scene that would be, that would be the river crossing where Lassie's trying to return to Roddy McDowall. (suspenseful music) The scripts read like Lassie enters a river and swims across and comes out exhausted, and they saw that scene and the director, Freddy Wilcox got up, and he says, "Well you know, Pal swam in," and he says, "Lassie swam out." They decided to shoot the whole movie starring my father's dog, Pal, who became Lassie. - I only knew the one dog, Pal, who I adored, I mean absolutely loved that dog. Destroyed, almost destroyed my association with any other animal because the dog was so amazing. (light hearted music) Thank you, Lassie. Everything that the story represented that was very important to people, it was emotionally very sound, and it was an extraordinarily potent propaganda film in its time because of what it was saying about a nation of extremely brave, stalwart people. - [Buyer] You're quite sure that you want to sell her? - No, Your Grace, I'll have to. - [Buyer] Fine, put that collar on her and lead her from the back of the cart. - Lassie came on the lot around the same time that I did and that was when they were first starting Lassie, Come Home. And of course I was very envious because, although I loved the part of Margaret in Journey for Margaret, I always hoped to do a Lassie movie with Roddy McDowall. Well I know Elizabeth Taylor loved animals, and so she was thrilled to be working with Lassie. She felt right at home with Lassie. - Poor, Lassie. Poor girl. (inspirational music) (dogs barking) - [June] To return to her beloved master, an exhausted Lassie journeyed hundreds of miles from Scotland to England. Those she met on her way would long remember her. - There's something else about you, my lass. And I'd dearly love to be inside thy mind and know what it is. That's the pity of it. You can understand some of man's language, but man isn't bright enough to understand thy. (inspirational music) (climactic music) - Lassie! Oh! You're my Lassie, come home. - [Roddy] The fact that it was so successful, that it went through the roof, I think, was part of the joy of the whole thing of a film being done very simply that had this enormous success. (silly music) (dogs barking) - [June] Collie dogs, and very specifically Lassie, now had a secure future at MGM. Son of Lassie carried on the story of Joe and his beloved collie. Pal, the original Lassie, now plays Laddie, son of Lassie. - Good morning, Joe. - Good morning. Goodbye. - Yours truly had the very difficult job of trying to win Joe's affection despite the competition of an adoring Laddie. (adventurous music) - Laddie! What are you doing here? - [June] Shot down over Norway and separated from his master, Laddie searches for Joe through a land devastated by war. Once again, the theme is the incredible hardship a dog will endure to return to his master. (inspiring music) - This dog knows only his master in this country. So you can see by his condition what he has been through in following him. He'll follow his single trail no matter how many others have crossed it. Find him, find your master. Turn around! (ominous music) Now turn around! (Lassie growling) (gun firing) (Lassie barking) (gun firing) - [June] Again and again, this theme would be struck. Laddie could be depended upon to protect a loved one. - Come on, lad. Come on, Laddie. Come on. (chuckles) Ah yes, there. There, there. Ah yes, there. Hey, Lass, our lads have come home. There, there. - When you would see Lassie look lovingly at whoever he was playing opposite, whether it was Elizabeth Taylor or Roddy McDowall or myself, I think it was very obvious that he was looking at Rudd and there was a mutual affection going on there, and Rudd was an ordinary, down to earth guy, and very appreciative of where he was, very hard working, kind to people, and to his animals. And he was a wonderful person to be around. - This was his personal dog that stayed at the house, this was somebody that was part of the family, like another person in the Weatherwax's family. - [Robert] Well, we'd have Lass in the house, and they'd say, he's one the couch. And my father said that's okay because he bought the couch. - Lassie had a limousine car take her to all the different sets and sometimes we would be on location or they would be on location on the back lots, and Lassie would be riding in her limousine with Mr. Weatherwax and so we'd sort of wave. And sometimes I'd be walking and Lassie would be riding. - Bill, go bring them back. Go, Bill. - In the first Lassie film, Elizabeth Taylor had a bid part. In Courage of Lassie, she had a costarring role opposite Lassie. This time Lassie, really Pal, was called upon to play a collie named Bill. Once again, happiness is short lived. (truck screeching) (dogs barking) The injured Bill has no identification tag and is soon recruited into the army. Report! (explosions popping) Once again, Lassie portrays in brilliant fashion a dog thrown into war. - [Soldier] You've been designated a combat patrol. In a few hours we'll land on Red Beach Five. As you may have heard, men, this is the illusion. (foreboding music) - Here's your big chance. All right, fella. - A new kind of duty called. - All right, report! (guns firing) (dramatic music) (Lassie barking) (train whistling) - [June] Like a human being, a dog can suffer shell shock. - Come on, fella, let's get out of here. (Lassie growling) (dramatic music) (Lassie growling) - [June] The memory of love can bring healing. (Lassie whining) - Lassie was like a sister or a brother to me. I mean, brave and and loyal and kind and trustworthy. Lassie was just like Lassie was when I saw her in the movies. He was gentle and warm and loving, and the old pro, and I was the newcomer on the block, and he was very patient with me, very patient. The story of Hills of Home involved a country doctor who needed a companion, a dog. - Well, come lass. - Well, I never saw that before. - [Janet] In the course of their first few times together, the doctor, Edmund Gwenn, found that the dog was afraid of water. - A collie afraid of water? It can't be. - But it is. - It had to be against his nature so, because collies normally love water. It was amazing to me how Rudd Weatherwax had trained him. - Come on, good girl. Here it is, for you, come on. (water splashing) (laughing) - [Janet] The director went through Rudd because Rudd and Lassie spoke their own language and the director was not privy to that. (suspenseful music) (Lassie barking) - [June] The relationship between a dog and master, its origins lost in time, but surviving every test. (wood creaking) (Lassie barking) Would Lassie be able to overcome her fear of water to save her master? - I wouldn't believe it. - It's a miracle! (dramatic music) (triumphant music) - All mighty god, be kind to William McClure as he's been kind to us for 40 years. And don't throw up his faults to him. Just think of the people he's helped. (bagpipe music) - If anyone has seen the picture of all the people in 1949 who were under contract at MGM, it ranges from way in the back on the right to Spencer Tracy, to the middle where there's Gable and Eva Gardner, and there, right in the center, right down on the first level is Lassie. And so I think that is an indication of how important the dog was to LB Mayer and to the studio. - [Janet] Lassie's appeal, I don't think we have to relegate that to a decade, because I think it's universal and it's eternal. You want good to triumph, you want bravery to be rewarded, you want loyalty to be rewarded, and I think that that's what Lassie always tried to tell us. (joyful music) - [Robert] Forbes Magazine called me once and told me that MGM had grossed $248 million with Lassie and like the fifth highest gross with MGM in the '40s. - [June] Every Lassie film produced in that time was shot in color and reflected the MGM touch with top ranking stars and respected directors. Challenge to Lassie in 1949 was very much in the Lassie tradition, and it boasted some old friends, actors Donald Crisp and Edmund Gwenn. - Off you go, Lassie. You can do it yourself now. That's a girl. (hopeful music) (Lassie barking) - [June] Once again, the theme is a dog's loyalty to her master. - Oh, could you spare a penny or two? - Well now, lads, I work for my money and you both look able to do the same. But today is a celebration. I'll stand you both a meal. (frightening music) (Lassie growling) - [June] Old Jock has died, unbeknownst to his friends. Even in death, the loyalty persists. There is only his faithful dog, Lassie. (forlorn music) - [Robert] With my father's technique of training dogs, he felt the dogs shouldn't do tricks. He'd seen a lot movies and the dogs always looked at the trainer or they did not look natural, they were being cute, or so he tried to develop a technique that he would feel that a dog would look natural. It would do everything when you wanted it. (Lassie barks) But he would never look at the trainer. He would actually portray that part. He would actually change moods. If it was a sad scene, Lassie should come in slow, he should have his head down, he should feel that mood. It would be off of voice inflection. - The payment of the license cannot be accepted from you. I shall, therefore, impose the usual fine and the dog will be put to death as the law provided. - We appeal! (Lassie barking) - Honestly, quiet that dog! (Lassie whining) - When the sunset bugle blows, her place is at Jock's grave. Her loyalty is to old Jock, and nothing save death will keep her from it. (Lassie whining) (glass shattering) (group exclaiming) - [Judge] A pretty speech, Mr. Traill, and one that I might have believed a few minutes ago. But now the dog's actions make me suspicious. - [Court Member] If Lassie is a wild and dangerous beast, then I have committed perjury before this court, and I have a right to clear myself. - Very well, the court will view your evidence, if there be any. (Lassie whining) - Mr. Traill, I can't but apologize to you and Lassie. For myself and my colleagues, for myself and all my colleagues, believe me when I say that the stain of Lassie's death will not soon leave our hearts. I give ye the freedom of the city of Edinburgh, and a free citizen of Edinburgh needs no license. (crowd cheering) - [Roddy] The extraordinary thing for me in relation to Lassie as a fellow performer was that I really related to the dog as if it was another human being. And of all the animals I've worked with, that is the most human one I've ever encountered. (harmonica music) - The Sun Comes Up was made about, I think it was about two years after the completion of The Yearling, so I was used to working with animals. Of course, working with a dog who was trained and smart was a lot different than working with an untrained deer. The Sun Comes Up, there were three different dogs that we used. There was Lassie, Laddie, and Major. And Lassie was the original Lassie. I'm not sure how old Lassie was at that point. Maybe eight, nine years old? I guess the most difficult scene was the fire scene and Lassie comes in and opens the door and then leads us to safety. Help me! (Lassie whimpering) You hear that? In here! (Lassie whimpering) (coughing) Come on, Lassie! Come on! It was Lassie who was used pretty much inside to unlock the door and was really kind of the smarter of the dogs. We had a scene where they had to jump down off the roof, and Major was the one who did that, so he was the more athletic of dogs. Come on, Lassie, jump! - [Man] Hold it tight, watch her! - I would say he was more the stunt man. I never knew, really, how Rudd trained the dogs. I was never aware of it on the set. He was almost like he had read the script the night before and did his homework and we were never in a situation where we had to wait. Lassie was always ready to go. - The thing I know that my father told Louis B. Mayer is that Lassie became his pet project. Whenever anybody came to the studio, anybody wanted to visit, the first place he took 'em, the first place they wanted to go was to see this dog Lassie that made these movies. And one day my father was walking Lassie on one of the lots and the gardener came and chased 'em off. And Louis B Mayer heard about that and he put up signs that Lassie can walk on any lawn in MGM at any time. People say, this is a male dog, why do you call it Lassie? A female collie will lose her coat. They both shed during the year, during the summer they'll lose a lot of their coat, but the female loses it to a greater degree, to where you can actually notice the difference. - It's interesting how Rudd got the rights to the name Lassie. He was on the contract to MGM and they called Rudd in one day and said, we're not gonna make any more Lassie pictures. We'll give you the $40,000 we owe you. Rudd said no, look, I don't want $40,000. Give me the rights to the name Lassie. That's all I want. So they gave Rudd the name Lassie, and the rest was history. - [June] From 1943 to 1951, Lassie starred in seven feature films at MGM. The times were changing, and so, too, were the pictures that reflected them. - They wanted realism and they wanted, (scoffs) what we get on the news, they wanted the pictures to be. - [Boy] Lassie! - And what I think happened, and happened with not just Lassie, that wonderful family shows that used to be on the films went to television. - [Man] To young Jeff Miller, I leave the best thing I've got, my dog Lassie. - To me? - She's all yours son. - [June] In September of 1954, Lassie appeared for the first time as a television program on the CBS network and the Campbell Soup company would remain its sole sponsor for many years. My friend Jan who played the lead in the original Broadway production of Rogers and Hammerstein's Carousel, was to be the Lassie show's first television mother. - There was no father on the show. My father had supposedly been killed in the war, but there was a grandfather played by George Cleveland. Come on, Lassie, we're home! (dramatic music) Lassie, Lassie, come back! Lassie! Lassie, Lassie come back! Lassie! - Darling, you can't make her stay. Not if she doesn't want to. - But I haven't even had a chance, Mom. Oh, please, Gramps, please. - Look boy, there's one thing you've got to understand. The Lord made animals free, just like human beings. And you can't force 'em to love ya. They got to do the deciding. - Come on, I'll bet you're thirsty, aren't ya? No, I'll bet you're hungry. Come on. Of course, you won't be getting lamb chops every day. Well Lassie and I became very close and it got to a point where if Rudd was calling Lassie and I was calling Lassie, Lassie would stand there and look and not really know who to go to, and sometimes would come to me instead of Rudd. So, we had to put a little distance in the relationship so that Lassie would know who his real master was. Sit, sit, Lassie! Lie down, lie down. Get on your side, get on your side. Put your head down. Dead dog, bang! - Well look at that. - All right, come on. That isn't all. Here, Lassie. Watch it, watch it. Get it! (joyful music) Gramps, she's my dog now, isn't she, Gramps? - Yes, boy, she's all yours now. She's done her deciding. - I've been fortunate enough to know all the dogs. Our pilot was done with the old man, and then the dog that I worked with was the second in line. - We've had eight Lassies in 50 years. This is the eighth Lassie, and what we've always looked for, the original Lassie had markings that are very distinct markings and they're actually genetic imperfections as far as the Collie Club is concerned. Right here, this is called a blaze, and the collie people don't like the blaze because the blaze, they'd rather have the blacked out look. Lassie has a full white collar. The original dog, Pal, established this pattern. And then he has two front white legs, and a lot of collies don't. When we're breeding Lassies, we try to get those markings, and they're all bred father to son. Now they all have different personalities, you know. They've all looked very much the same in their markings, and they've all been trained, and they have all performed similar, but they all have different personalities. - I think, perhaps, up until this latest one, Howard, whom I adore, I really liked mine the best. I thought, and Howard reminds me a lot of mine. (whistling) Just enough mischief to be a real dog, but a gorgeous look and a strong personality and playful and friendly. - Oh! - She wants to shake hands, darling. (ominous music) - Want this? Is this good meat? Huh, Lassie, girl? Eat it, enjoy yourself. (overlapping yelling) - [Jeff] Why'd she do it? Why'd she try to hurt Lassie? - [Ellen] Probably to keep Lassie from winning the race. That was just another way to make you unhappy. - I hate her. - I know, I know darling. But hating isn't going to help. Jeff, will you listen to me? Maybe this is our chance to do something for Melanie. She's run away. Mrs. Biegee saw her down on the Lake Road. She's a terribly unhappy and terribly frightened little girl. I'd like you and Gramps to go down to the lake and bring her back. - Melanie, Melanie! Melanie! Melanie, stop! Melanie, come back. - Help! - Gramps! - You don't have to think about it anymore, it's all over, darling. We know that you didn't mean to poison Lassie. Well you didn't even know the meat was spoiled. - But I did try to make her lose the race. It was a bad thing. - Oh, I don't know about that. Maybe it was a good thing? Maybe it taught you something. - May I come in? - Of course. - I (sighs), wildflowers. - Oh, Jeff, they're beauiful. - They smell pretty. Thank you. - Oh, there's a friend of yours who wants to say hello. (Lassie barking) Come on in. (hopeful music) - I would describe the philosophy of the show as good, warm family values. And of course, in its time, keep in mind that the show was filmed in the 1950s. Well I never went through a change of dog in my four years on the series. It was all with the same dog. After four years on the show, there was some realization in 1957 that you could become typed, and contrary to being good for your career, became apparent that it could be as much of a curse as a blessing. I was 15 years old. I had been working in show business almost without a break since I was five years old, and I wanted to go to a regular school. I was beginning to discover cars and girls. (dramatic music) - Why it's a child. - I had the looks and everything they wanted, but the most important part was Lassie. I had to get Lassie's approval. So I went and lived with Rudd Weatherwax and his wife and Lassie out on their ranch. And obviously, Lassie and I got along great. That was basically it. I got Lassie's approval, I had the job. - [June] After almost four years, the Miller family left the fictitious town of Calverton. At about the same time, the Lassie name and program were bought by oil man Jack Wrather, his wife and eventual coproducer was former child star, Bonita Granville. A new family, Ruth and Paul Martin, moved in with Lassie and her now new master, Timmy. But there would soon be further changes. - My first father was Jon Shepodd Cloris Leachman was my mother in the original first couple episodes. And actually, she went on for about a half a season and then decided, I think, that she didn't wanna be stuck in this kitchen baking cookies for seven years. So one Sunday, you saw my parents, Cloris Leachman and John, and then the next Sunday it was June Lockhart and Hugh Reilly. And they didn't even get one, well maybe on letter. Because, I don't know, it just seemed everybody would focus on the boy and the dog. - I was working in live television and appearing in plays on Broadway, but there was something very appealing about being on a weekly television show that had as it's main theme, the need for more love in the world. (Lassie whining) - Lassie, don't. Calm down, it's our fishing pole. - She would influence people of all ages, all ages. My mother, god bless her, was quite ill. She was in the hospital, and Rudd's wife brought Lassie over to that hospital, and Lassie stood outside my mother's room, which happened to be, luckily, on the first floor. And I said, Mun, there's somebody, I call my mother Mun, Mun there's somebody outside this window that wants to say hello to you. My mother went over and there stood Lassie. Well, it was one of those moments where you don't say anything 'cause you don't have to. Lassie was looking at my mother with those big eyes, and my mother's crying beautiful tears. - You're heading for a peck of trouble and you keep putting off taking that boy back to his kinfolk. - Well I'm gonna call the welfare agency right now. - What are you calling them for? Talked to the boy's aunt this morning. She knows he's here. So all you gotta do is take him back, that's all? - Where's Timmy? - He said he was tired, told him to take a nap. Well, it'll do him good. Poor kid didn't get much sleep last night. - It's that underlying theme, the understanding, the caring, the loving of Lassie. Who could ask for anything better than that? (Lassie whimpering) I'm going away and you can't come with me. So don't follow me. (Lassie barking) Guess I can't stop ya if you wanna come along. At least I won't be alone. - [Jeff] I've got good news for ya anyhow. You're gonna stay with us all summer. - I am? - Mom's fixing it up. (Lassie barking) Oh, Timmy. Oh, Timmy, Timmy, you scared me so. - [Jeff] He's all right, Mom. I told him about staying with us. - Is it true? - Yes, Darling, it's true. (Lassie barking) - [June] Lassie seems to understand, to reach into the human heart. Her gift is the love that money cannot buy, the love that asks nothing in return. (inspirational music) - Lassie, that tickles! I'm glad you're my dog. And you always will be, won't ya, girl? (Lassie barking) - [June] From the beginning, Lassie had been a television hit. It's very first year it won an Emmy for Best Children's Program. An average show was watched by over 33 million viewers. Now the question was, with a new family in place, would the magic of Lassie continue? The answer would be a resounding yes. (Lassie barking) - Lassie likes everybody. Don't ya, girl? (Lassie barking) But why would anybody be afraid of Lassie? - Oh now, we mustn't judge people. I'm sure the Bridells have a very good reason for not liking dogs. Well we must just try to show them that dogs like Lassie make very fine friends. Don't you worry about it. - I think the importance of Lassie was that you always learned something about an episode. There was always a moral feeling to it. First thing we've got to do is make Henry like you. And a thing you have to do is make believe you like Henry an awful lot. (joyful music) - She likes me! - Sure she does. (Lassie whining) (Lassie barking) - Timmy, she's wonderful! I sure wish Lassie was my dog. - You're doing a real good job, Lassie. He's beginning to like you already. If Timmy got stuck and Lassie saved him, it always ended with, this is why that happened and so next time you won't get in trouble. (Lassie barking) (foreboding music) Lassie, I'm scared. - I don't wanna frighten you, ma'am, but there's a cougar prowling around this area. I've set a series of four traps in each of these spots. - [June] Sometimes it wasn't only Timmy Lassie had to save. She came to my rescue more than once. (suspenseful music) (Ruth grunting) Ow. (suspenseful music) (Lassie barking) Good dog. Lassie, do you remember the C clamp that the trapper brought? (Lassie barking) (dramatic music) - From Rudd, I really learned a respect for animals. They have just as many rights as we do. (dramatic music) - [Paul] Hunters having been killing wild game with their bows and arrows. Shoot the poor things and then let 'em wander off to die. (Lassie barking) - Poor little baby bear. - We'll get those men, Timmy. They're not only cruel, they're a disgrace to an ancient sport. - Dollar for every hit? - You got a bet. I got six today, you only got five. Wait a minute. (dramatic music) - What, hold. (Lassie barking) (man yelling) - Let go of me! - [Ruth] And don't we always hope for the best, and isn't that what makes the best come true? All right then, now let's just hope for the best. (inspirational music) - Lassie, Lassie, you're alive! - Alive and kicking. She did everything but put the handcuffs on these varmints. - She tracked 'em down. (Lassie barking) I think Lassie was reaching for the heartland, for what we left when we moved into the cities. That kind of relationship, the boy and the dog and the young man's parents, was almost, it was, it was an ideal. And that, I think, is what they were really trying to get across. That you know, yes, this is mythical town and a mythical family. (charming music) - Despite the fact that we thought of Lassie as a symbol, and there was just one Lassie, we did have to replace the dog on several occasions. And Rudd would always have one in the hopper, as it were. - There were fight scenes with Lassie, but Lassie didn't do the fight scenes. The dogs that did the fight scene was a different Lassie, and just as a stunt man would do a stunt for a movie star, Lassie had a stunt dog. And Lassie was not allowed to do, and Lassie did not have the nature to do fights. - He doesn't do anything that's unbelievable, or he doesn't do anything that we believe that would make his character corny or laughable. - Bring in the kitten, please. We believed that the more of continuous scene that you can get with the dog, with less cuts, it was also more believable to the audience. - [Steve] Okay, Rudd, I think we're ready. Do you wanna get your men in position? - Okay. - Such as one scene we did, there's a little cat stranded out in the middle of this lake and he's in this boat and Lassie sees him. - Up on the bank, and when I call, I'm gonna be in the boat, when I call, you let go, and Robert? You stand over there, and when Lassie gets hold of the rope, you call him in there. All right, Rudd, call Lassie! - [Rudd] Lassie, come on, jump! (Lassie barking) - Come on, come on jump! (inspirational music) - [Robert] My father was stationed opposite of the boat, he makes Lassie get in the water, Lassie swims out, he has Lassie pick the rope up. I'm in the other direction where he was sent from, so I call him back. He brings the boat, goes to shore. I tell him to drop the rope, my father tells him to get in the boat, pick up the cat. - Come on, baby. (dramatic music) - [Robert] I would call him out of the shot, and that was the end of the shot, he would save the cat. - And cut! That's great! (crew applauding) - Actors always know when the take is good because the director tells them so. Lassie always knew when the take was good because she got a piece of beef. - Oh ho, you're a good dog. You are a good dog. (Lassie barking) - Your dog's as good as you treat 'em, so we never had much problem with that during the movies, that they'd want to ever mistreat a dog or anything. I remember when we used to do personal appearances with Lassie between shows, my father would have a writer put on this contract that said we'd take Lassie to hospitals. I remember one time we went to a hospital with a little boy, and he was dying, and they said that he didn't probably have long to live. The sensitivity of the collie, I'll never forget, we took Lassie and normally we'd say, Lassie, put your feet up. And he'd just put his feet up, you know? But he knew something about this boy, and when he put his feet up, it was very delicately, and it's hard to talk about. And the boy did pass away, but he saw Lassie before he did, and he knew it was Lassie. - I remember we were shooting in Williamsburg, Virginia one time, and Lassie was not in the particular action and was lying in the station wagon all alone, and there was one young boy standing by and looking at Lassie. And I happened to be wandering around, and this young boy, I heard him say, "Gee, I wish I was Lassie." - [Lorne] It's hard to explain that alchemy of why a dog would have such power over people. But it's all associated with that Lassie character and a connection made between the dog and values, values that we all care about, and that are endearing and enduring. - My years with Lassie were wonderful, but the producers wanted to go beyond the farm to take the program to far off locals, and so shows about Lassie and the farm family came to an end. But this meant a new beginning. (suspenseful music) (horn honking) - We had written so many stories about this little boy and the dog that we were running into ourselves. And so we decided that we were going to try to make the show with a forest ranger, and that was a time we started making the show in color. - [June] This time, Lassie's master was forest ranger Corey Stuart, a part played in all kinds of environments by actor Robert Bray. (foreboding music) (Lassie barking) - [Steve] For the last half dozen years of the show, we traveled all over the country. - [June] On some programs, the original color film has faded, but viewing these moments in black and white has not lessened their drama. (rocks crashing) (suspenseful music) - Help! Help, if there's anyone up there, help me! The rope, push it over. Easy. (suspenseful music) (thudding) - Our concept didn't change because of the changing scenery because Lassie was still Lassie, and she transcended anything you tried to do. - Come with me. I need you. Lassie? (sobs) Lassie, please. (Lassie whimpering) (ominous music) Come on. I had to have her. - I taught you to keep the commandments. Thou shalt not steal. (Lassie barks) Don't take the dog away from her. Maddie ain't never asked for much. You've gotta do this for me. (dramatic music) - Lassie! - Come on, Lassie! (suspenseful music) (gunshot resounds) - Come on. - She's his dog. I know that now. Nothing I can do will change it. - Well ideas sprung from every place. They could start with animals, they could start with a location. (dog barking) But they always went back to Lassie and Lassie's reactions to things. (dog whines) (inspirational music) All we had to say, close on Lassie, it seems as if she cries, understands, could feel the emotions of what we're trying to say. And all they had to do is put the camera on Lassie and take a closeup of that beautiful face and those eyes, and our point was taken. (inspirational music) - [June] For each of its years on CBS, the Lassie program had been number one in its time period. It became the longest running family show on network television. - In a film history sense, Lassie is an MGM dog. I'm not even sure Lassie bit. Rin Tin Tin, the Warner's dog, I think, bit. Lassie was more intuitive and regal and had something that was very knowing and emotional, and maybe a little, sometimes at it worst, I think a little overwrought, but nevertheless, moving. - I'm not so sure people accept Lassie's apparent perception on the show as being reality any more than they accept a mouse can talk when they're entertained by Mickey Mouse. Well, in return for suspending that belief in reality, you go into a wonderful fantasy land by choice, that feels good to be into. - That's exactly why it's so wonderful to be able to see that. It doesn't hurt anyone to be able to look back and see that there was a time when things were a little more peaceful, a little more quiet, a little more decent, and a little safer for all of us. - All right, come on, 'sget 'em, attaboy. Go on, go to the woods now. He was a free spirit, he never had a leash. He always ran loose. Come on, hey, hey. Come on, get it, pick it up. Sget him, pick it up, pull it. Pull it, pull, pull. That's a boy! Pick it up, come on, pick it up. Pick it up. That's my boy, here, get this for me. Take it out, pick it up. That's it. Maybe there isn't a dog like Lassie, but there could be a dog like Lassie. He's not super, he's not anything special as far as strength or special feats, but he has intelligence, he's sensitive, and he seems to understand the problems and the things around him. Here Lassie, speak. Speak, speak, speak, speak. (Lassie barking) He knows like 85 to 90 commands. Turn to your right, turn. Stay, turn to your left, stay. All right, Lassie, come on crawl. Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl. Come on, crawl, stay. Get over, get over. Atta boy, dig it up. Dig it up, dig. Dig it up, dig it up, come on, dig. Dig it up, dig it up, dig it up. Atta boy, dig it up. All right, on your back. All right, come on now. Stay, put your head down. Put it down. On your feet, that a boy, take a bow. That's it, all right. (inspiring music) Come on, come on. Come on. Now my father said, you know, every boy needs a dog, he says, but every dog needs a boy. - Give me those! You drop those! Whoa. How'd you find this place? (Lassie barking) - Well, that's what it's all about. A boy and a dog, and met boy's best friend as opposed to man's best friend. This is a scene in which Lassie takes away from our young hero his headphones. He's constantly listening to MTV, to rock and roll, and hiding in effect from life, from the world. And the dog is hip to that and wants to introduce this boy to the joys of nature. - Looks cold. (light hearted music) (water splashing) That was awesome! That was totally awesome! I'm not kidding! (Lassie barking) - Action! - Hey, come on, come ahead. - History was being repeated, 50 years after the release of the first Lassie feature film, a new one was being made. - Cut! - Cut! - [June] In addition to years on network television, cable, and syndication, Lassie programs continue to be shown around the world. Lassie's message is still being seen and heard. (Lassie barking) - Bye. - See ya. - I think the picture deals with the myth and acknowledges the old television series, and the old movies, and tries to find what there is in a contemporary setting that's relevant about that. - Let's do one more! - What? - And I think that that kind of emotion is. when you put it on the screen and you tell a story in a very simple way, can be very powerful. (Lassie Barking) - [Daniel] Well, I hope that this film is part of the continuity of the story that involved a boy and a dog that are fulfilling and ennobling to the human spirit. (inspirational music) - [Steve] A boy and a dog is, goes down through the history of motion pictures. It's phenomenal, but it's always there. It's like mom's apple pie. - [Robert] It's the companionship, it's the respect for one another, the helping one another that you can't really get from say, a boy and his cat. - [June] The story of Lassie is a classic tale that can be told again and again. These images appeal to all of us, suggesting a time we all want to share. Lassie, simple stories of a boy and his dog and the bond that exists between them. But Lassie is also much, much more. As long as there is that yearning in our hearts for undemanding loyalty and courage, for a love that asks little in return, Lassie will live forever. (dramatic music) - Oh! You're my Lassie come home. (inspirational music)
