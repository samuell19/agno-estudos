Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. How's it coming? - Nothing. You got anything? - Nothing. Did you ever see anything like this street? It's a cemetery. It's worse on the boulevard. I ain't found a soul to talk to in an hour. Yeah. It sure gets on your nerves. People are scared to go out on the streets. Can't blame them. There's no percentage in getting your head split open. Sure ain't. How's the missus? - Nervous. She says no matter what happens, I should stay on my horse. [ Radio: ] "Calling car number 12." "Calling car number 12. Another ax murder." Hey, Phil. It's another one. "Proceed at once to 100 Block, Harbour Street." Right around the corner. Hurry up. We were here two minutes after the alarm, Inspector. It's murder alright. The victim's head .. - Yes, I got it on my radio. Another one of ..? - Same. Got the weapon? - Yes, sir. Caught him red-handed. Same as the other five. Alright. Never mind that. Hello, Inspector. Another gloomy Gus. Same as the others. Won't say a word. - He's been snubbing us. Come on pal, you can break our vow of silence now. Nah, that's all he's done since we got here. Okay. Take him to headquarters. Come on. You'd better make it quick. That crowd out there is beginning to get ugly. We'll get him through alright, chief. Don't be afraid. We are your friends. Nobody is going to hurt you. We just want to know. Why you killed Jean Ellis. Just try to think. Where did you get the weapon? The ax. Get him a glass of water. - Yes, sir. Oh, nix. Nix. Kindness to dumb animals is alright. We've already got five lunatics salted away in padded cells. Eating jelly omelets at the taxpayer's expense. We've a million readers scared to death to go on the street. What's the matter? Haven't you fellows caught on yet, there is such a thing as lunacy in the world? I can't get a thing out of him, doctor. Of course not. He isn't listening. He doesn't even hear me now. Uhuh .. he's in the midst of a hallucination. Will you do me a favor. Leave him alone in the room for a few minutes. I think I can explain something to the gentlemen of the press. Alright doctor, it's your dish. Go ahead. Outside, everybody. You mean, you're going to leave him here alone? Why don't you give him an ax, doc? So he won't feel lonesome. Have some of the boys watch the windows from the outside. I'm going to show these men what schizophrenia really is. Now I think that even you gentlemen will grant that he's quite alone. So what? - Observe. His behaviour is just the same. He is still talking with someone. Who? - His other self. He's in a world apart. A world no ordinary or normal person can ever enter. Just look at him. Right now he's hearing his own voice. Someone is talking to him. - Uhuh. Now he's answering the voice he hears. Arguing with it. I tell you. You have to get away from the idea that you're dealing with ordinary criminals. Now you'll be able to understand this .. If only you'll think of them as listeners. Oh doc, they're not just listeners. They are killers. Five innocent people have been killed by them and we must know why it's happened. Yeah. - That's easy. It is mass hysteria. An epidemic. Like a real-estate boom. Or a wave of suicides. You mean you want us to go on telling readers that a bunch of insane men .. Are hacking away at them willy-nilly for no reason? You've got it exactly. Well boys, there is nothing like psychology. Alright, boys. You heard the doctor. It's an epidemic. Isolated cases of lunatics grabbing axes and killing strangers. That's your interview. It's a fine interview. - That's a fine interview. Everybody leave your addresses before you go. Hey, Oliver. Where you going? Oh lock up the dressing room for me will you, Jim. I'm going home. Are you going to change? No. I have to impress the hotel manager .. or else. Good luck. Paper. New ax victim dead. Victim number six. Paper, mister? City wallows in bloodbath. Five cents, mister. No. That's a penny. - Oh please, mister. The victim's head was almost severed with an ax. Well, that ought to be worth a nickel, even if it's my last one. Here. - Thanks. Extra! You've waited too long. Edwina Brown is still alive. You don't want her to live. Don't you remember? She hates you. She's the cause of all your trouble. She's your enemy. And she's alive. Alive in her home, dancing somewhere. Walking in the streets. You can kill her easily. Kill her .. tonight. Tonight, in the street. I'll show you. No, no, no. Don't go in there. They'll tell you lies in there about forgiveness. We must not forgive. Come. Come away. Edwina Brown is over there in the street. Don't let her get away. Go after her. Kill her. No, no. Don't follow me. I'm nobody to follow. I am the truth. The truth everybody knows: how she hurt you, how she tortured you. She is your enemy. Follow her. Make her pay for what she's done. Don't stop. Keep walking. Hurry, please. - What's the matter? I don't want to frighten you, Miss. The fact is there is someone following you. Someone whose looks I don't like at all. I don't see anyone. Are you sure? That's very funny. He must have ducked down that alley. Come on, you'd better get out of here. - Alright. Say, do you know what I think? - No, I don't. I think you're trying to pick me up. Oh no, really I'm not. - Oh yes I do, because .. There is no-one following me. No-one but you, that is. Look, there was a man following you and there's been a murder in town tonight. Besides, you're .. Well, you're not my type. Oh. So please, let's go on. - Alright. Of course, if there was someone. Then it's very kind of you to go to this trouble. Oh not at all, not at all. - But if there wasn't .. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Because now you're nothing but a masher. A street masher. Well, that's still a lot better than an ax masher. Come on. I wish I could make up my mind. - Think about it while we're walking. Anyway, there is no need of you to go any further as there is no-one here now. Look, I wish you'd come along as I wish to hand you over to the next Policeman. Alright. If you really mean it, there is a Policeman. Officer, Officer. I wish you'd take charge of this young woman. Someone was following her. I saw .. He was following me .. - Will you be quiet. What's your complaint, Miss? Why, only that .. He started talking to me and .. And then arguing, and I don't know him. I never saw him before in all my life. Oh, a bustle-rustler, huh? I tell you I saw a rather ugly looking citizen following her. And I thought .. That's what you thought. Everyone thinks everybody is following everyone tonight. But I've got an idea you're taking advantage of the situation. Officer, if you'll just hold on to him for a minute, I'll run on ahead. You don't have to run, Miss. Just take your time. This mug here is going to take a long walk down that block right over there. Thank you, Officer. Hey, fellah. What's your name? Duffy. - Duffy, eh? Ah, probably one of then north-of-Ireland Duffys. [ Lady's scream! ] Fancy meeting you here. Oh you were right, there was somebody right behind me. Honest there was. Oh! What's that? - I thought you'd gone. No. I'm here. Where do you live anyway? - Right over there. Come on. I'll see you there. I'm awfully sorry I misunderstood you. Oh that's alright. Nobody understands me. Well you see, I didn't think you were a gentleman. Your clothes fooled me. Oh but you are a gentleman. I can see that now. You're a head waiter, aren't you? I am an actor. Oh. Ah, you recognize me? - No. But I like actors. Evidently you don't like actors enough. Is this goodbye? I don't know. Goodbye. Oh, would you come back for a minute. The light doesn't seem to work, and I don't smoke. I only live half a flight up. Je vis ? moiti? en haut d?un escalier. As we used to say in Paris. Ah .. where do you want me to put this key? Oh, right down there on the table. You can put your hat there too, if you care to sit down for a while. Well, thank you. With pleasure. That's perfectly alright. I can stand. That's Sheree. - Hmm. Oliver Duffy. You know there's an old superstition among cats that actors are unlucky. Dog actors. I'm Edwina Brown. I've been looking forward to meeting you for the longest time. Thank you very much. Sheree. A word with you. People in my profession usually eat at night. That's when we're hungriest. People in my profession usually don't eat at all. Hey, is this you? That's when I was young, in Paris. Didn't they tell you when you were in Paris that I'd been there? No. Were you? I'm glad. I always say that only people who have been in Paris .. Really understand life. How true. Take Woodrow Wilson. Well of course that doesn't include the tourists. You have to work there. Naturally. Work and suffer. - Oh yes. Now I've been longing to understand life for a long while now. What struck you most about it? I'm serious. It was in Paris that I first saw through men. Oh they are most transparent there. If you're going to make fun of me .. Much more so than here, I mean. Well. Yes. Say, do you mind saying what it was about me that made you .. Decide I was a 'masher'? Well, you don't look like a masher. And that's how I thought a masher would want to look. Not like a masher. Very sensible. And now that we understand each other so thoroughly .. Would you call it flirting if I took down some vital statistics? Now don't mind this. It's an old actor's trick. Name. Edwina. Brown. Telephone number. Whitehall 1267. What are you smiling at? - I just had a very happy notion. Would you have supper with me tomorrow night? Say, I pick you up at your Caf?? Well, I think that would be very nice. Good .. named? The Elmirador. El .. mir .. You get the funniest moods. What's the matter, now? I could have sworn I just .. Just what? Nothing. I .. I think I'm going to ask you to keep the window closed. The one in your bedroom. Oh, is that all? That's for Sheree so he can come and go. If you want .. - Well, I .. I do. Sheree's life of fun and frolic is over for tonight. Ah, mon petite Sheree. Any other window open? Only in the bathroom. I think you'd better lock it. Alright. I .. I haven't frightened you, but .. I've been careful ever since I was scalped by Indians. In a play. - Oh. Am I supposed to be frightened? You're only supposed to give me. Your solemn promise to keep those windows locked all night. They say in Paris the night air is bad for the complexion. I promise. Good. And I'll be looking forward to a dazzling complexion tomorrow. Au revoir. - Alors. Demain. Until tomorrow. Say, you're not even listening. Still thinking of that wonder man of yours, ain't you? Well, it's okay. The way to be when you're young. You'll find out soon enough that no man is perfect. This one is perfect. That's kind of a snap judgement isn't it? You only met him last night. Oh you could tell too, if you'd seen him. Right away. Does he wear a sign? Oh, Babe, didn't I tell you? He wore a full dress suit and a white tie. Probably a pallbearer. Just goes to show you never learn nothing. I say not to go out alone on the streets, you'll get murdered. Instead, you meet a high-class gink. Well. Telegram for Miss Edwina. Thank you. He can't come. His wife won't let him. Tough luck, kid. Goodnight. Are you Miss Brown? Yes. But I didn't order any taxicab. A gentleman named Duffy sent me. - Oh. He said to tell you there is a friend of yours inside. Oh? Oh, Sheree. Alright, thank you. - Yes, Miss. It's all paid for, Miss. And he told me to give you this here, too. Somebody is looking after you, alright. - Well, thank you. Oh, Sheree. Here .. here .. Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, Sheree. Sheree, where are you? Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Sheree. Here kitty .. Here kitty, kitty, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty. What's that? I see you. I see you. Ah! Don't be afraid. It's only me. What in the world ..? - It's nothing. Shush. Now. I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. Can you stand a shock? - Another one? Edwina, somebody tried to break in here last night. I was parked out there on the fire escape. It was around five o'clock and I must have just dozed off. So I wasn't able to do much more than scare them away. You were out on the fire escape? All night? Why, you must have been awfully uncomfortable. Here is something else to think of. Something is going to happen here, honey. You won't believe it, but .. - Oh yes I will, if you say so. It's going to happen tonight. What is? I'll give you a rough idea. Look. This catch has been deliberately loosened from the bedroom window. The one we locked last night. Now do you trust me? - Yes. How do you feel? - I'm fine. Go on, then. Business as usual. Now look. You walk in there, turn on the lights. Pull down the shade, pretend to be undressing, whatever you do every night. Then, when the lights are all out, come back in here to me. You ready? - Okay. By the way, what do people call you? Well, they usually call me Edwina. But that's wrong. - Got it. Come on, Sheree. Now you stay in here a minute. Don't worry. We'll catch this amateur Dracula. Now look .. when I grab him. You turn on the light, then run to the window and yell for help. But loud. My cat. - Oh, he'll be alright. I've got him. Quick! Help. Police! Help. It's a maniac. Help! What you say? What's the matter? Where is he? Where is the maniac? Jump, kid. Jump out of the window. Okay sister, we'll be right up. Call the Police. Oliver .. Oliver. - I'm alright. Open the door. She's coming, Chief. What's the matter? Is she injured? Not so as you'd have noticed. Oh, how do you do, Miss Brown. This is great break for all of us. Right here, Miss Brown. This is Mr Duffy, Chief. - Glad to know you. If you were on the force, I would cite you for a medal. Congratulations. Well .. you know how it is with an actor out of work. Nothing to do, and I .. - Yes. Won't you sit down, Mr Duffy? The newspaper boy has come in. - Not yet. No, no. I've got to ask this beautiful young lady a few questions first. You know the situation. You are the only one in this series of crimes .. Lucky enough to be able to tell the tale of what actually happened. We have a theory of course, but there is a chance you may lead us to something. For instance. Did you ever see or hear this killer before? Oh, I'm afraid you're on the wrong track there, Inspector. There's no reason or pattern to these crimes. The man I caught was an out-and-out lunatic. Yes. Yes, I understand that, Mr Duffy. In what way did you think you first attracted the attention of the man? Well, I don't .. exactly .. Well, go on and tell him. It was by parading home from her work in the dead of night alone. Miss Brown. Will you tell us .. In your own words .. Just what you observed when this man gained access to your apartment? Pardon? Look, Inspector. You see, the window we came in is here. Now .. If you don't mind, I'll walk through it for you. Alright, I'm the lunatic. I come in raving mad. I'm sure of that because if he'd been faking I'd know. You see, I'm an actor. Yes. We're beginning to see that, young man. And I tell you what. Suppose you give your interview to the press? I think that is more in your line. I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know. Of course .. Oh, just one request please, sir. I wish you'd take it easy on Miss Brown. It's awful late and she's been through a lot. Don't worry, son. We'll take great care of our witness, won't we Miss Brown. Oh, Allison. We're putting you up at a first-class hotel. And .. Allison, were you ever a lady's maid? Well, I want you to go to Miss Brown's flat and get her .. A nightgown and a powder box and .. And whatever you see there and then check her in at the Clayburn. I got you, Chief. Now Miss Brown, I want you to think hard. And see if you can shed some light .. On this crisis we've got in our city. I'm sure you want to help us if you can. Well, I think .. The photographers will bite through the door .. If you don't give them have Miss Browns picture soon. Is this the patient? Yes. Miss Brown, this is Dr Cromwall. Would you like ask her some questions? No. They taught us in medical school to recognize when somebody is fast asleep. Why, this poor child is out on her feet. Maybe you're right, doctor. - Come on, Miss Brown. You get through with those .. Those tabloid apes out there and then go on home. Thank you so much. Now all we want is a few loving poses with the heroine of the hour. Here is Miss Brown now. Here, Miss Brown. We want to get a few photographs. There you are, boys. Get the lovebirds in action. Look him in the face, Miss. Show how you feel about him. Hold it, Miss Brown. A bit closer, Mr Duffy. Put your arm around her. - What's your next show, Mr Duffy? Well frankly, I don't know. That's .. always a sensitive point with an actor out of work. So, what are your plans then? Come on, give us that big smile, Miss Brown. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow with my company. Hey, Miss Brown. Hold that smile. There she is. - Thank you. Miss Brown? We've been expecting you, Miss Brown. The Lieutenant registered for you. Your things are upstairs. I'll see Miss Brown to her room. - Very well, sir. Suite 407, right across from the elevator. I once bought the loveliest greeting card. It was for goodbye. I wish I could remember it. Uh .. No sadder word can ever come between you .. Uh .. something, something. So not goodbye. Just say: 'I'll be seeing you'. Now look here. That's my department, quoting poetry. 'And all the while the night was haunted by her smile'. Gee, it hardly seems worthwhile getting acquainted for .. Such a little bit of poetry. Want to know how Chinese say goodbye? - Yes. It is quickly .. goodbye. [ Buzzer ] Oh, it's you. Yeah, it's me. - Oh, I'm so glad. I couldn't go to sleep after you said goodbye. The way the Chinese do. I .. I wasn't saying goodbye. I ducked out as I saw another one of those ax-boys at the end of the hall. You mean there is a .. A lunatic? Here, in the hotel? Ah, sit down Eddie. I want to ask you something. You know what this means? This second lunatic being after you? Well. Isn't it just a coincidence? No. No. Two lunatics both after you .. Means there is something about this whole thing that isn't loony. Why, those nuts weren't chasing anybody. They wanted you. And they're crazy. That means somebody sent them. Somebody with a good, sane reason for wanting to get rid of you. Why, it's the only way it makes sense. Wanting to get rid of me? Yes. Who is it, Eddie? Who hates you? But I don't know. How should I know? - Oh, you must know. Oh but I don't. Really, I don't. I've never done anything to anybody. Well, something must have happened to you somewhere. It might be a scandal. Why you practically told me last night something did happen to you. In Paris you said it was. Something that made you see through men. Oh .. did I say that? Now how is anyone going to help you Eddie, if you don't tell the truth? Oh. Oh, I remember now. In Paris. Oh .. oh that was nothing at all. It was just. My ballet teacher. What about him? It was nothing really, Oliver. He .. He just misled me about my dancing. He told me I was going to be a great dancer, but .. He was only trying to get money out of me for my lessons. Oh, he was terribly dishonest. Terribly. But, I don't think he was a murderer .. because .. Well, I just don't. So the ballet master of the Cazenove Ballet .. Tried to cheat you out of a few dollars for dancing lessons? Yes, wasn't it awful. You wouldn't believe it, would you. Look. I'm not married. And I'm not married for just one reason. I don't like liars. Every girl I ever met turned out to be a liar sooner or later. Well, that's not for Daddy. When I marry I want someone I know through and through. Not just her name, but .. But the real shape of her lips. And the real color of her fingernails. What happened to the engagement ring you used to wear on that finger? I lost it. - Who gave it to you? Uh .. my brother. I only wore it on that finger because it didn't fit any other. I wasn't engaged to him. I mean. Oh Oliver, please. - You're lying, Edwina. That's the usual answer: tears. You shouldn't have tried to lying to an actor, Miss Brown. I know too much about it. The pause .. the hesitation. The way a liar always draws in her breath. Even that extra air of frankness that's in your eyes right now. Alright. If you prefer lying to living .. You've made your choice. If I ever see a bed again, I'll marry it. Not in here. Around the back, you fool. Here. Come down here. You'll be perfectly safe here. Perfectly safe. Come. [ Gunshot! ] How long have we been waiting now? Did you tell the Inspector I was waiting? Yeah. I told him. Gentlemen, the Inspector will see you. - Come on, boys. Hello, Doc. How's your dementia praecox catatonia? Hey Doc, I dreamed about a beautiful blond last night. What's my psychology? He's got a swell story for you. A thing new in the annals of criminology. Yes, Your Honor. I understand. Hello boys. - Hi, Inspector. Sit down. You'd better take out your pencils. The mayor is very anxious for you to get this straight. Gentlemen. At 5 o'clock this morning the Police Department began the biggest manhunt .. Any of you have ever witnessed. For the first time in Police history .. We're rounding up the criminals before they've injured anyone. We're making the streets safe for the people of this city. I'm going out after every derelict, moron or suspicious character .. And sweeping them off the streets. We're going to have them fingerprinted and put away. And they're not going to be let out as long as there's any trouble in the city. Well, are there any questions? Any bounty on them morons, Inspector? I can bring in some of my wife's family. The jail is big enough, Inspector. - Wait. Don't let 'em print that story, Inspector. You'll absolutely be on the wrong track. Duffy, I hope you're not just making a nuisance of yourself. What makes you say a thing like that? Somebody is sending those lunatics out. And I can prove it. Something happened last night that .. Well I know it sounds incredible .. Come to the point, Duffy. Miss Brown was waylaid by another maniac last night. A second one, and that proves .. You're looking for more publicity. There's reason behind these crimes. A plan at the back of them. Not just lunacy. The curfew shall not ring tonight. Whatever you may think of actors, it's your duty .. Listen Mack, we got work to do. Those voices they hear are real, I tell you. There is somebody at the back of them. A cunning, dangerous .. Sit down, Duffy. Sit down. I'm going to put you straight. Now, if you're not using this case just to get yourself in the limelight. You're doing something worse. You are trying to butt in as an amateur detective. You come busting in here with your brain fixed on an old chestnut. The 'Mastermind' theory. I don't say that you're manufacturing evidence. But you're imagining evidence. Just to try to prove it. And that I'm afraid is where your second lunatic comes in. Would it make any difference if I told you the second lunatic was in the hotel? Waiting for Miss Brown outside her room? No. If there was such a man .. He was a thug .. a hotel worker. What I'm trying to tell you son, is this. Now we don't need your help. We're working on every angle of this case. Things you're not equipped to think about. Now, for instance. Every ax that was found on the killers is being traced. Just in case there is any connection. And another thing I'll bet you never even noticed. One of the most striking things about the case. The name of every killer in this series starts with 'B'. Banhoff, Blackstone, Bixley and so on. Now, did you notice that? No. No, I didn't. That's what I mean. So I tell you what, sonny. Let's make a bargain. Don't you be a Policeman, and I won't act, huh? 'B'. What the deuce could that mean? 'B'. Oh good. Duffy, come here. I want to see if he has any reaction. Hello. - Hello. This man is wonderful. The most perfect example of a split personality you ever saw. Hey Bixley, look. You see? He's got something written on every one of those little bits of paper. And now he's arranging them. That's a form of paranoia that's really rare. It's called a compulsive disorder. It's a mania for putting things in order. Hey. Bixley. Here is your real enemy. The man who beat you up. He had quite a flare-up when he saw Miss Brown. He threw these little pieces of paper at me. He did? Oh, Miss Brown. I may want Dr Immelman to see Bixley's reaction to you. Where can I find you this afternoon? I'll be at the Theodore Bell Dancing Academy. Thank you. These little pieces of paper. Uh .. nobody can read them. Would you like to have one as a souvenir? For what? Oh .. of .. How you saved my life. Please don't be angry. Edwina, I've been trying to impress Gallagher with the fact .. There was another man after you, but he doesn't believe me. Now I think for your own safety you'd better go in and tell him what happened. But Oliver, what can I tell him? I didn't see anybody. Well I'm afraid you'll just have to take my word for it. I'm no liar. I don't tell lies either, Mr Duffy. Okay. Miss Brown. Inspector Gallagher will see you now. Park View Theatre, please. [ Radio: ] "We interrupt the program to bring the latest developments .." "In our City's struggle against the epidemic of ax-murders." "The Morning Bulletin is offering a reward of $25,000 .."

You can't go in there today, buddy. - Ah, but I have business. They're just taking Police work today. Only loonies. I tell you I have .. - I said, only loonies. Beat it. Ah .. Officer. This is terribly important. You see. There is a man in there who's promised to tell me how to get up to the moon. And if I don't get up there by 5 o'clock. I don't care who you've got to see, you can't .. What? Come on .. get in line. Babinski reflex absent. Are there any more schizophrenics out there? Put your shoe on, my friend. And remember, there are no evil spirits. Come along now. Bring him in. Oliver Brown. Age 30. Suffering from delusions. He told the arresting officer he had theories about how to get to the moon. Over here, Mr Brown. Mr Oliver Brown. Alright Ollie, sit down. Take your shoe off. Which one? I have two. I know you have two. Whichever you wish. A little confusion, ma'am. Now, what seems to be the trouble with the moon, Ollie? Ah. Why, that's terrible. What's terrible? Shush. Not so loud. Oh. Everything is all mixed up. I have to straighten it. - Take your hands off this desk. That's alright. Let him work. [ German language ] That's unbelievable. I've only seen three cases since I left Germany. Don't do that. No, no. This is a beautiful example. Look at the rigidity of his eyes. Maybe I use him tonight before the psychiatric society in my lecture. Ollie, Ollie. How would you like to .. Fix things up in a fine, big university? With maybe fifty doctors to see how good you work. Yes? - The files. Oh. Files. I have to straighten them, too. The key. Give me it. I must have a key. - Give him the key. But doctor, you said yourself nobody can touch the files. Only psychiatrists. A crazy man is just as valuable to science as a psychiatrist. More. You think they have been disturbed? - I know they have been disturbed. Watch carefully. According to B?utler, these cases sometimes go into reverse .. And they start to destroy everything. In reverse, doctor? - Yeah, yes. You see their mania is to put everything in order. When they go into reverse, they wish to disarrange everything. Create confusion. Ah, but that is very rare. It is too much to hope for I'm afraid. This is most wonderful. No, no. Leave him. It's alright. He will stop when he gets tired. Ridgeley Hospital. Just a moment. I will connect you. Ridgeley Hospital. Stan, look in the ward. - Okay. Down this way, doctor. Notify the police outside, quick. One of the schizophrenics has escaped. Right away, doctor. Yes? Yes. Just a moment. I'll connect you. Ridgeley Hospital. No he's not. I'm sorry. Pardon me, could you tell me what this telephone number is? Yes. Whitehall 3222. Ridgeley hospital. Yes? Doctor Klinzman? Just a moment, please. I'll page him. Just a moment, please. Ridgley Hospital. Hello. I want you to send an ambulance to the Theodore Bell Dancing Academy. Right away, please.

No, no. Don't come in here. Wait, wait. Where's the man with the broken leg? - Broken leg? What broken leg? Do we look like we've got broken legs? - Yes. Somebody called an ambulance. Well, I don't want an ambulance. Get that thing out of here. Oh come on, it's a phony call. Go away, go away. Can't you see we're trying to dance. I've no time for you. Okay, give me a call when you're through. Alright girls. And one .. They are from the hospital. - Yeah, so am I. Look .. I have something I want to talk to you about. Come on over here a minute. Listen. I've just come from a clinic for mental cases and what do you think I saw there? Every one of those murderers' names all indexed .. in a row. Oh, somebody is making a list of them. No. Somebody got those names of out of that file in the first place. Got them and used them. What's more, the only persons allowed to look in that file are doctors. Psychiatrists. So, it's a psychiatrist we're after. We are? - Yes. What is it you don't understand? Why didn't you go away to New York? Well, The Bulletin has offered a $25,000 reward. For a solution to the crimes. By the way, that piece of paper you gave me had a clue on it. If you keep on helping me it will be fifty/fifty. I don't see why you think I can help you. Oh don't worry. I'm not going to pry into that pretty past of yours. But I'm going to show you every psychiatrist in the city. And when you come face-to-face with the man who is trying to bump you off .. I doubt if you'll cling to the notion that you never saw him before. Face to face with him? Yeah. They're having a meeting somewhere tonight and we have to find out where. Come on, get you clothes changed. Every psychiatrist in town will probably be here tonight. Now remember. If you recognize any of these wizards as someone you've seen before, speak up. And don't be scared. Oh .. my hat. - What's the matter? It's Dr Immelman, the man who examined me today at the clinic. Well, what do we do? Pretend he's a godsend. Well, Dr Immelman, how do you do? Well sure, I believe you're up to forgetting that you met me in Zurich. I'm Dr Stephen Daedalus of Ireland. And this is Mrs Daedalus. How are you? Come on, dear. We don't want to be late for the meeting. I am sorry to have to tell the members of this society .. That several of our number have shown quite a paranoid outlook .. About appearing here tonight. They have exhibited a suspicious, seclusive .. And uncommunicative attitude toward our meeting. In other words, they haven't showed up. One of these is our learned colleague, Dr Santelle. However he was good enough to send his paper on the work for which he is known. I intend therefore, to appoint a substitute to read it. I'm going to choose the one with the handsomest delivery. Doctor Jeremy. After the learned doctor's introduction. I ought to be allowed to recite King Lear at least. Here, here, here. Look at every face and keep on looking. 'The inquiry into treating dementia praecox and pharmacological shock'. 'In this case, insulin must concern itself with, One: ' 'A study of certain vital alterations of metabolic processes in the bloodstream'. Oh .. I know somebody here. What? Who? In the second row. In the third seat. That man. I know I've seen him somewhere. Idiot. That's doctor Cromwall. You saw him at Police Headquarters. Oh. 'It's well to be on the watch constantly for symptoms of death'. 'The symptoms to be watched for are ..' 'The disappearance of pulse and other signs of respiratory failure'. What are you thinking? Immelman is catching on. Don't waste a minute. Keep looking. What are they doing? Come on. It's too late. We're sunk. What is it? - Immelman. He's recognized me. He's headed this way. Come on. Well, that's that. You didn't see him. He wasn't there. I'll check up tomorrow on the membership to find who avoided the meeting. There's a taxi. - Where are we going? Visiting. We know one who wasn't there, anyway. Who? The gentleman who wrote that horrible, boring article. He wasn't present, so we'll have a look at this modest fellow. Don't you just love the night time? Deeply. Yeah, his name is Santelle. Santelle. Santelle. Now, it's easy. We're reporters. We just ask him a few intelligent questions about his article. I'll ask him. All you have to do is look at him and if you've ever seen him before, nod. Not now, dear. When you see him. Then I'll get you out. Well, what if I have seen him before? - I'll get you out either way. Yes? Hello. Is the doctor in? - Who is calling, please? We're reporters from The Bulletin. We've come from this meeting. We'd like to interview the doctor about his work. Well, I don't know. Wait just a moment. I'll see. Come in, Mrs Geversar. People to see the doctor. Reporters. And what do the reporters want to see me about? It's about this, sir. No. No, Mrs Geversar. I don't want to see any visitors. I have some important work to finish. Shall I tell them, sir? No. No .. I'll ring when I'm ready. - Yes, sir. Will you sit down, please. I'll let you know when the doctor is ready. Well, if he's willing to see us, this is probably a waste of time. Where is Robansier Avenue? South side? Oh, it's a long way. You take the elevator. What's there? It's the address of the corresponding secretary of The Neurological Society. The doctor will see you now. This way, please. Do come in, please. What can I do for you? Holy yikes. Hang on to me. Good evening, doctor. I understand that this insulin work of yours was completed several years ago. I wonder if you'd mind telling us what you've been working on since. Behind you. There on the desk. You will find abstracts of all my recent works. Take them with you and make up your own interview. And now will you excuse me? I am busy, as you see. Oh, just one moment, doctor. I .. wondered if you'd .. Well you see, this young lady here is a sketch artist on The Bulletin and .. She .. she'd like to make a sketch of you. Would you mind .. Taking off your mask? Why, no. Not at all. Ah. Ah, well you forgot your paper and pencil. I didn't bring. - Are you sure? Well okay, doctor. We'll then, we'll just .. Run the story without the sketch. Thanks. Thanks very much. Awfully nice of you. I certainly appreciate it. Goodbye now. Thank you, Paul. Sorry I took off the mask, Dr Santelle, but I didn't know what else to do. You were perfectly right, and I'm much obliged to you. It may seem silly but .. I don't want to become known to reporters. I've an unconquerable phobia about the press. You may go now. Thank you again. Not at all, sir. Goodnight. - Goodnight. I hope we don't have to bother any more doctors. Innocent ones, mean. Ah, I guess he was innocent alright, but .. I'd rather annoy 20 innocent ones than let this one guilty one go on. We're up against the most abominable human being there is. A doctor. He's supposed to help others. Help other people but .. Instead, he uses poor mad people's brains, their hallucinations. And he's embarked on a little program of extermination. The X-Rays are negative. Nothing broken at all. He's alright then? He's not in danger? He's as good as new except for bruises and slight concussion. The unbreakable Duffy. That's me. You're awake. Now go back to sleep. You're perfectly alright. Better come with me and have a cup of tea. Well, may I speak to Mr Duffy for a moment? It's very important. Not long though. I'll be in the kitchen across the hall. - Alright. I don't suppose you saw who pushed me? Well, there was such a crowd. Well. It proves our doctor pal is getting desperate. We must have tickled him up a bit somewhere along the line. Oliver. I want to tell you everything. That would be quite a help. Well .. I lied about it at first because .. I didn't want you to hate me. I'm afraid you are going to hate me. Go ahead. Well. You were right about it happening in Paris. I was working in the ballet there. I used to take walks in the parks in the mornings. So that's how I met him. Who? This man. He liked me a lot. I guess I thought I liked him. Well anyway, he kept asking me to marry him. Uhuh. And so I got engaged and .. It was in the paper. I still have a clipping of it if you want to see it. Spare me the blueprints. Well go on, I'm listening. Well. Just after they printed about it in the paper he .. He disappeared. And? And I never heard from him again. But .. What's the point? I don't know. That's what I'm trying to tell you. What are you trying to tell me? Isn't it obvious? He .. he jilted me. That's what I didn't want to tell you. In heaven's name, why not? Because .. I knew you would care anything at all about a girl who .. Who'd been jilted by another man. Who said so? Oh that's how men are. I know. Great galloping catfish. What are you doing? I'm happy. I haven't a care in the world. Now I'm going to take a nap. And when I catch up on my sleep. We're going to move in on this train pusher-underer. You mean .. you mean you don't mind about .. my having been jilted? I think you're the cutest little goon that ever lived. And you don't think my .. Ex-fianc?e has anything to do with the murders? Don't talk about him. - I won't. He was a doctor, he said. His name was Caesar. That Julius? No. Caesar Ferrari. That's what he said but I didn't marry him so I never found if it was true. If you don't stop talking about him, I'm going to jilt you myself. Do you mean .. we're engaged? Are we engaged? Well .. Well how should I know? You didn't tell me you loved me. Look, I've stood for your lying. I've overlooked your insults. I've fought for you and spotted the other guy with the ax. I've been killed for you. I think I love you. But if I don't you'd better turn me over to Dr Immelman. Ah, Oliver. That's the most wonderful proposal. When are we going to be married? Just as soon as we catch the murderer and collect the twenty-five grand. Now go away now and let me sleep. And don't leave this hospital tonight, no matter what happens. Get another room or something. Wait. Give me a kiss, darling. Goodnight, my love. Did they give you a hypodermic before? - Uhuh. This will make you sleep. - Goody. Where is Edwina Brown? Huh? Who are you? - Never mind. You know where Edwina Brown is. You may as well say because you're going to die. You've just had 200 units of insulin. They'll get you. - No. There will be no trace of your murder. Not even in your autopsy. Just this little needle mark where they gave you the hypodermic. No. Don't struggle, you can't get to the bell. In a few moments you're going into a deep coma. Tell me quickly. You may be able to save her. Where is Edwina Brown? Where is she? Caesar. - What did you say? Caesar, an old friend of mine. I wonder why he's here. You made some mistake. That was Doctor Santelle. Doctor Santelle? Oh no, I've met him and .. Are you sure? Of course. He had a patient here in the hospital several months ago. When he first came back from Paris. Paris. Then there must be some connection. What? Never mind right now. I've got to go out. When Mr Duffy wakes up, will you tell him that I'm .. I'm on the trail of $25,000. Mr Duffy. Mr Duffy. Mr Duffy. Doctor, come quickly. Control yourself. People are sleeping. - But something's wrong with my patient. Will you look at him right here in 412? What medication has he had? Just an injection of morphine, doctor. Here is the chart. Cold as a fish. You sure that what he got was morphine? I didn't prepare the injection myself. Dr Crooke did. I just charted it. Hmm. A weak, rapid pulse. He's certainly in a coma. He's certainly in shock. He's got air-hunger. I may be crazy and I don't know how it may have happened .. But this looks like insulin shock to me. Get me some 25% glucose and a syringe. - Yes, doctor. How am I doing? When we get a bit more sugar in your blood, you'll be able to run a race. I want to see you in my office nurse, when you are through here. This accident calls for a thorough investigation. It wasn't an accident. - What? It was attempted murder. I'll tell you all about it in a minute. Alright, Mr Duffy. We'll come back and hear your story when you're a little stronger. Well, I finally have it figured out. Where is Miss Brown? - She went out a little while ago. What do you mean, went out? She left a message for you. Said to tell you that she was on the trail of $25,000. Holy Mike, she hasn't got the brains of a pancake. Oh, it's alright, I'm sure. - Why? She went to join Dr Santelle. Seemed to think he was an old friend. She went to join Dr Santelle? - Now that's not so bad, is it. Now, you relax and get some sleep and stop worrying. But she hasn't got .. - Now, quiet. Hello. Get me Inspector Gallagher at Police Headquarters right away. Yes .. and call me back, please. I send you today some interesting cases. But the best one, he got away. He escaped me twice. A pity. I consider him the leading split personality in all America. Ah, but you have him here. Dr Cromwall told me his name was Duffy. What's he talking about? What's this about Duffy? Well, it seems we missed a trick. Duffy is a psychopath. Yes, he was picked up earlier in the day by a Cop in the Moron Hunt. Then he escaped, attended a medical meeting and created a disturbance. Duffy a lunatic? No. Well, I certainly take the word of Dr Immelman. He's probably the greatest neuro-psychiatrist alive today. I had a case like this in D?sseldorf. A man using persecution psychotics to commit his crimes. What you would call, a case of a 'mastermind'. Then why did he try to warn me there was a mastermind? That's not logical. Because he's matching wits with the police. Even risking capture, to show off. That's typical. Where is the girl? She gave me the slip at the dancing school. We're trying to trace her. I can tell you where she was: at the meeting with Duffy. Broadcast an alarm. Turn the town upside down but find her. If you don't .. I tell you where you will find her. Under the ax of another lunatic. [ Telephone ] Yeah? "Your call to Police HQ. They won't let anyone through to Inspector Gallagher." Alright. I'll talk to anyone on the homicide squad. Hello. Here is a message for Inspector Gallagher. Edwina Brown, the girl who was attacked by a maniac a couple of nights ago. Has just been abducted from St James Hospital. Sure, I'll tell you who I am. My name is Oliver Duffy. And I'm a man with a gun in my pocket and I'm going out to shoot somebody. I'm only sorry I haven't got an ax. Hold on a minute, will you. I've got a call here on Edwina Brown. There is a man named Duffy says he's going to murders somebody with an ax. He's on the wire now. Put him on, for Pete's sake. Trace this call. It's Duffy. He admits he's going to kill somebody with an ax. That's Duffy alright. Hello. Oh hello there, son. Where are you? Oh .. St James Hospital? Well, there is nothing the matter with you, is there, son? Oh, it's Miss Brown. You think somebody abducted her? For ransom, would you say? Oh it isn't a question of that. She hasn't any money. And he's tried to kill her before. Well, he may have done it already. Crazy as a loon. Why does he want to kill her, in your opinion? I don't know. Why does anyone murder? I'm no philosopher. But in case anything should happen to me .. I want to tell you the name of the mastermind of all your murders. "His name is Doctor Santelle." Doctor Santelle, eh? Well .. hello? He hung up. Where's he calling from? Thanks, Gillie. He called from the hospital alright. Okay Gillie, get me that number. Right. Did I hear you say 'Dr Santelle'? That's the man he says is the mastermind. Hello, St James Hospital? Homicide Squad headquarters. A man, name of Duffy, a patient in your hospital, wanted for homicide. Hold him until we get there and make an arrest .. get going. I'll hang on. Duffy sure picks them. Doctor Santelle is one of the world's greatest physicians. He's lived abroad nearly all his life. Mostly in Paris. Now, one of his uncles died and left him several million dollars. He's no need to practice. That's right. Did you nab him? I see. It's Duffy. He lammed. He beat it down the hospital fire escape. Broadcast an alarm. Have someone phone Dr Santelle there's a homicidal maniac on his way there. Tell him to lay low until we can get him. Come on, we're going after Duffy. Hello Edwina .. I'm sorry, my dear. I didn't mean to startle you. Oh you .. you scared me. I thought you'd gone inside and I was .. You were looking for me and here I am. Won't you come in? Oh no, I can't. Of course you can. - Oh no. Please, don't let us argue about it out here. Your phone is ringing. You'd better answer it and I'll wait here. I never take my calls. If people can't reach a doctor at night, they phone another. I'll take your coat. But it might be important, and besides, I have to be going anyway. Not at this time of night, Edwina. The streets aren't safe. That's alright. I'll call a taxi. I'll call my car .. and run you home myself in a few minutes. Really Caesar, it isn't necessary. - Don't you remember how stubborn I am? It's just as easy to call a cab. We'll be more comfortable in here. This is my office. Yes, of course. You've been here before. - Yes. The man I met here said he was Dr Santelle and .. And tonight at the hospital. The nurse said you were Dr Santelle. Caesar, who is Dr Santelle? Won't you sit down? Who is he? Don't you remember the doctor I worked for in Paris? The psychiatrist who gave me all those afternoons off so I could be with you. Oh, that's who it was. You talked about him all the time. What happened to him? He died. And you came here taking a dead man's place. Oh Caesar, how awful. Not too awful, Edwina. You see, just before Dr Santelle died .. he inherited some money. Quite a lot of money. So much in fact, I turned myself away from you to come here and collect it. But it isn't yours. They'll find out about it. I doubt it. You see. Dr Santelle lived in Europe for nearly twenty years. Not a soul here knows what he looked like. Well, they know what you look like. There were seven people here who knew me from Paris. Only seven. Andre Marshal, who ran a boarding house. Samson Ellis, the tailor who made my suits. Samson Ellis? He was killed by an ax murderer. They all were. By a stroke of luck. Six strokes of luck to be exact. And now there is only one person in this city. Who knows me by sight. You mean me? - That's right, Edwina. You are the only one of the group that's been lucky. It's a very unlucky group. You should have chosen your companions more carefully. But .. what about you? You are in danger, too. If all the people we knew in Paris are being murdered, aren't you frightened? Really, Edwina. I'm fairly certain that even you can't be that stupid. Oh, I don't think it's being stupid being frightened when .. When you're in danger. And we're not the only one's either. There is .. There is Lily Fl?ret. Lily Fl?ret? You remember Lily the .. The dressmaker who lived next door to you all that time in Paris? Well, she's in danger too. Those maniacs will be after her next. Then there were eight people? She's only been in town a short while and she hasn't any friends. Or anyone to protect her. I've got to warn her. Yes, yes. Of course. You know where she lives? Oh yes .. I have her address right here in my bag. It must be out there with my coat. I'll get it. What's the matter? Don't you want me to get it? We'll get it together. Let's see. I think I put it right in here. I'm sure I did. I guess it's right here in my .. [ Door knocks ] Open up. Police. Open up! Open up! It's the Police. Well, it looks like Duffy has beat us to it. Santelle has probably been mashed to a pulp. Nonsense. Duffy couldn't have got here yet. Get those cars out of sight. Park them around the corner. We don't want to frighten him away. Open up, here. Why doesn't somebody answer? Yes? - Dr Santelle? Yes. Inspector Gallagher. Homicide Squad. - How do you do. What can I do for you? I can't explain out here, doctor. Come on, boys. Hurry up. Hurry up and get that door shut. Where is the light switch? It's over there, but may I ask why ..? - Get the light. I'm sorry to intrude in on you in this way, doctor. But you're in danger. There is a homicidal maniac on his way here. A fellow named Duffy. - But that's impossible. I mean .. It's alarming. A homicidal maniac, eh? He's an out-and-out paranoid, doctor. We've just discovered that he's responsible .. For the whole recent series of ax murders. Indeed? Not so loud. I'm Doctor Cromwall. The County psychiatrist. I've known you a long time. - You have? By reputation, that is. Oh, thank you. Quiet. Get back there. Alright boys, grab him! Oh it's you, Inspector. Where is Edwina? - Suppose you tell us that. Well, I can't but there's the man that can. What have you done with her? A violent case, isn't he. - Sure is. Now look, you .. You must listen to me. This man is a butcher. I can prove it. Lucky for me you came here, Inspector. Definitely homicidal. Take him away. - I swear that .. Shut up, you. Get those cars back, Tom. - Yes, sir. That's it, hold him, boys. Well doctor, it's been a pleasure meeting you. Oh. Beg your pardon. Sorry we had to bother you, Dr Santelle. - Not at all. I'm very grateful to you. It sure is a big moment for me. Clearing up these ax-killings is one of the dirtiest jobs I've ever handled. I will need your testimony by the way. - I am at your disposal. Wait. Bring him back here, boys. What's the matter? Duffy may not be so crazy after all. May not be crazy? What are you trying to do, Cromwall? Make a patient out of me? I found this under the table. Edwin Brown had it when I left her this afternoon. It's quite simple. This lunatic dropped it. Duffy hasn't been near this table. I think we'd better have a look around, Inspector. I don't get it. You said that Duffy said .. Oh just find Edwina. That will answer all your questions. Alright. Dr Santelle, if you don't mind .. Hey .. quick. Very pretty shooting, Inspector. A bullseye. [ Banging noises ] What's that? Edwina. Are you alright? - Oh, Oliver. I'm fine. How are you? Well, I never felt better in my life. I'm sure glad to see you all in one piece, Miss Brown. Somebody has to tell me what this is all about. I'll tell you the whole story Inspector, but please not now. We've got to go and get married. Right away. Tonight. Huh? - Tonight? 0h yes .. after all I've been through .. I never want to spend another night alone as long as I live. And baby the way I feel I hope you live forever. '.tg.'
