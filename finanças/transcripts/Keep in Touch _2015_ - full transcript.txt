I'm here today to talk to you about destinations. Where are you going? Where do you see yourselves going? In life, we're all on these journeys, these adventures towards something. Now try for a minute to forget about where you are and how you got here. What is your destination? Maybe you want to be a millionaire. Rich-as-fuck cat with cars and planes and wives and ex-wives and kids. That's a destination. Or maybe you want something simpler. A home. That works. Now, with your destination in mind, think about the vehicle that takes you there. The vehicle that carries you along this journey. Some of you tried some illegal vehicles and that didn't work. But let me ask you, what is a vehicle of choice versus a vehicle of necessity, or laziness, or greed? What's this? But that's... Just you just told me to... I'm just messing with you. And honestly, I think it's better if you come back next week. Okay. I mean I won't get into trouble if I don't... You know, he told me to reschedule you yesterday and I forgot. Oh! The shit's got to stop. How old is your little girl? Two? Look... We've been through a lot. I'm going to go.Yeah. The goal here, is to give you something that your vehicle needs. I'm talking about a renewable, recyclable, inexhaustible source of fuel. Fuel for any vehicle. I'm talking about self-worth. Confidence. Pride. Come. Follow me. Do you want a massage? Er, no. No. I'm all right. Trust me. You're going to love this. Whoa! That? No? Okay. Uh, you remember that girl, Tina Cardozzi? We went to middle school with her. Hmm. Yeah, vaguely. Okay. Would you like to see what she looks like now? Okay. Yeah! Fuck yeah! Jesus.Right? Who knew? She was so quiet. Now she's not. Ah, if I had a time machine. How do you turn this thing off? Oh, yeah.

Room service. Finally! Okay? Okay, ciao. "Karin Parcel crashed her car when she hit a patch of ice. "Her daughter, Annie, was also killed in the accident. "Karin is survived by her husband Dallan and their younger daughter Jessica." Whoa, whoa! What the fuck you guys doing? Hey, hey, hey. What're you guys doing? What's the matter with you? Hey, you remember Annie Parcel? Annie Parcel? Of course, I remember Annie Parcel. She died. Yeah, yeah. I looked her up last night. You didn't know about that? No, I had no idea.That must've been a shock. Yeah. I was wondering what happened to her. Figured may be she'd be on Broadway by now. Wow. You and her had a thing. I sort of remember that. You were like best friends.Yeah. She was like your little best friend. Yeah. She was something like that. Wow. What, uh, what happened to her family? Do you know? Um... I don't know. Her mom died in the accident. Her dad moved away a couple years later. It's really sad. Yeah. Depressing. Let's go. How did you not know that? I don't know. I just...

Hands out of the pockets. Yeah, give it gas. You broke it. I'm putting you in charge of this plot of trees. They're not doing so hot and, uh, I want you to bring 'em back. Are you serious? Yeah. I know nothing about horticulture. I think it'll be good for you. To have your own territory. Plus, you know, guys don't really like you. They think you're a pussy. Can't mix pussies with fighters, Colin. Okay. But I still don't know what the hell to do with trees. Uh... Fertilizer, water. Cut some of the dead weight off. Shit, water, dead weight. It's no sweat. No, I don't think this is a good idea. Hey, dick face. It's my nursery, and those trees are as good as dead anyway. So I really don't care if you fuck it up, just do your best. And stop complaining.

Bronx Park East. Stand clear of the closing doors, please. What about you? Same. What're you doing? Nothing. All right. You keep a look out. Sure there's no creeps out there. Why is it that we think that our lives have value? That's interesting to think about. What system do you use to measure what that value is? The decimal system, yards, meters. How much money you make? And how many pancakes you can eat in two minutes. Why do we assign a value to ourselves based on things that sometimes are beyond our control? I invited you all here today to talk about an opportunity. An opportunity. When I say opportunity, I'm not referring to an easy way to earn a dollar. I'm talking about a set of circumstances that make it possible to do something. To do what? Well, that's up to you. Yeah. How do I know this isn't some pyramid scheme? I'm so happy you asked that question. This is an alternative business model. It's the business model of the future. We live in the age of entrepreneur... This feels like a scam to me. Then maybe it's not for you. I'm not here to convince you. All I can do is offer you tools to create a successful business. And a lifestyle designed by you for you. A chance to be a better you. This business is not for the lazy or the pessimistic. It's for those who want to know with certainty that if they put in the work they will reap the rewards. And, we just happen to have some of the highest-quality wellness products on the market. If you weren't so damn pretty, I might still have a chance. Ladies, that is how you handle a naysayer. How'd it go? You pumped? Yeah. I'm getting the hang of this. You know you don't have to do it, right? No, I want to. But you have such a great job. Babe, I'm not getting any younger. If we're going to have kids I want to spend every minute I can with them. Whoa, you're beginning to sound like my mom. You know, that doesn't offend me. Because I... I want a home. I want a family. Hmm. Hi, Colin.Hi Ma. Are you ready to embark on a life-changing journey with Vita? I'm good.You and Dana together could really... Ma, I'm not so much the guy for the job, thanks. When did you become such a crabapple? He didn't get it from me. Noted. Oh, come on. It's just pie. You know why they call it just pie? No.Here we go. 'Cause it's just pie. Brilliant. Are you done in there or what? Because I have to get going actually. You go on ahead. We have a few more things to go over. True. Because you know, Mom, it did take a long time to build those original pyramids. Goodbye, Colin.Just saying. I resent that. He's in a funk. I can't get him out of it. Sexually? No. His attitude, his mood. Baby, I love my son, but you are a peach. I mean, a real good one. He needs to be reminded of the beautiful, dynamic girl he has in front of him. You mean, you want me to tell him I'm a catch? No. Of course not. You can't always reason with men. Sometimes the cow don't move until you prod it. You need to wake that boy up. There is no one that has no value, there is no one that has an absolute value. We all have value. Now that's some Gandhi shit right there. That's some John motherfucking Lennon. Right there. Value is in the eye of the valuer. You know what? I want everyone just to take a moment and look around the room. There is no Youped without you. Without "you," it makes up at least half of this company. So why don't you have a look at the person opposite you, sorry, next to you? And I want you to say, thank you. Look at your neighbor and say, thank you. Thank you. Do you want to know why I asked you guys to thank each other? Because I just finished negotiations, and... ...as of today, we'll be joining the Amazon family in the latest of tech acquisitions. Yes! Yes! It's all you! You! Yes, You! That is awesome, yes! It's a Fossil. Wow! Yeah. I wanted to, uh, I guess, show you my thank you. You know? Mmm-hmm. So I know it doesn't always seem like it. I don't forget the fact that you and I set this thing up together. You know? Man, your contributions in the beginning burst something really special. Wow! Okay? Thanks a lot. Let's not, let's not do that. I'm sorry? Let's not to do that. Sure. I know.We are... We are... Okay? You put the keys in the ignition, I acknowledge that, but I drove the car. I backed it out of the driveway and I merged into four lines of traffic, without my headlights on. You're not mad at me. You are mad at yourself. Now, I empathize. Sadly, I cannot take responsibility for it. Why do some of us think our own lives are worth nothing? What apocalyptic force encourages us and convinces us that this is true? How do we get beyond that? I'm going to stay with my sister for the weekend. Okay. I think you need some time. By yourself. By myself? I'm a catch, Colin. Okay, what are you talking about? What scares you in life? What scares me? Really? Yeah. Bears. Knives. Guns. Mass shootings.You want to know what scares me? Failure. Mediocrity. Financial instability. Being alone. Okay. I'm scared of those things too. So what are you going to do about it? Are you breaking up with me? I don't know. Be careful. Colin, be careful. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Hey. Can you do me a favor? Yeah. Sure. I think there's a bottle of water over there. That one. Mmm-hmm. I'm not really a morning person. Yeah. Me neither. Not normally. So this isn't like a normal day for you? No, no. Not really. Pass me the other bottle. How old are you? 36. Oof. Do you have a job? Yeah, I work at a nursery. Okay. So you like kids? No, like trees. I dig and plant trees. But kids are fine. Kids are fine. So do you like use a chainsaw and stuff or... No, no. Not really. So what do you do? I fertilize. I plant trees and... Sometimes I cut dead branches. Yeah. Ow! Ow? Did that really hurt? No, I'm fine. Ow. I'm sorry. So where were you? I slept in. Slept in? Yeah. Did you get good sleep? I did actually, thank you. No, I'm sorry, seriously. Sorry about that. Look, man. I want this to work out for you okay? Try harder. Okay. All right? All right, boss. All right, brother. Cousin. Oh, hey. Do you think you can uh, do me a favor and pick me up tomorrow at 11:00? I need to go somewhere. Sure. Cool. You know it's really not much point fertilizing in this cold weather but I didn't want to tell you because you're doing such a great job. Mummy got some new boots? BRAD JR: Mmm-hmm. Fun. You know who paid for those boots? Daddy, with child support. Hey! Hey. Hey.Hey. Oh, right. Oh, Colin, this is Brad Junior. Brad Junior, this is your Uncle Colin. What's up, Uncle Colin? Oh, Brad Junior? You hungry? No. I'm good. Are you up for some fruit? You want some fruit? Yes! Yeah? I'm fine. You know where we're going? North Ave, right? Yeah. Thanks, by the way. Dude, don't mention it. It's just great to have my cousin back. Remember that time when we were kids? You got that paintball gun for Christmas. Thought you were playing hide and seek but really I was just hunting you. No, I don't really. Well, you have to remember that. Your mom, like, really lost it on me. You had welts on your body for like a week. Well, you look like shit. Yeah, uh, I didn't get much sleep last night. You, uh, depressed? I think so. Well, you know what, Colin, that's normal, you know. This is all a process. Yeah, I know. So, uh... Nursery keeping you busy? Yeah, yeah. It's, uh, lot of long hours. You know? Lot of labor. I usually end up... I'm so tired I just crash when I get home. Yeah? Yeah. No late nights in the Bronx buying dope? No. You sure? Yeah. You growing anything else other than trees up there? No. You watch a lot of porn? I met a girl. Hey, that's great. Where did you meet her? Oh, I have known her since, you know, she's from my home town.Mmm-hmm? Yeah. Uh, singer. Wow. She any good? Oh, yeah, yeah, she's real good, yeah. She's in Brooklyn you know, so... Oh. That's... That's great! Yeah. That's really great.It's great. You get out to see her shows? All the time. I mean, sometimes... A coup... Once. What do you do, drive? Drive? Oh, God, no. Metro North. The Metro North to Brooklyn? Well, Grand Central subway to Brooklyn. Why the fuck are you telling me that? You have been granted permission by the state of Connecticut to leave the state for one reason and one reason only. That's to work. They didn't grant you parole so you can go chasing tail all over New York City at all hours. The only reason you're sitting here with me and not in prison, is because your father, God rest his soul, left you a place to live and your cousin gave you a job.Right. But let me be very clear about this. You're not a free man. Not a free man.You're not. Sorry.Don't be sorry! You know what happens in New York City after 12:00 a.m.? Nothing good. Nothing good happens in New York City after 12:00 a.m. You got it? Got it. Repeat after me. Nothing good happens after 12:00 a.m. Nothing good happens after 12:00 a.m..That's right. any trouble at all, anything whatsoever, you go back to jail? New York City is no place for you, Colin. Look, Colin, I get it okay? Bad things happen to good people. Now you gotta make a choice. You gotta decide whether you're going to pick yourself up and rebuild from the ashes, or you're going to stay... ...a depressed little bitch that dreams about what he had before God turned his back on him. Okay. Think about that.I will. Think about that.I'll think about it. How're doing with that watermelon, bud? Good. Yeah? It's an underrated fruit. How did it go? Fine. Yeah? Yeah. You're good if we stop somewhere before I drop you off? Yeah, as long as it's not a strip club. Hey, Junior, you want to go to a strip club? You will someday, my man. You will. No, seriously, where are we going? Booty call. You know, gotta, gotta see about a girl.Mmm-hmm. His mum wants to move away. What, like far away? Yeah, Florida. And what does that mean? That, uh, probably, I guess get him in the summers hopefully, and she'll take him the rest of the year. Yeah. It's not what you want, right? No. No, I mean, I want him all the time. You know, I love him. But I don't know if that's realistic, you know? I mean, as it is, I'm probably going to need to get some help, may be an au pair or something. Hmm, remember that... What was the name of that, uh... That housekeeper your dad used to have? Which one? Zhu... Zhu... Zhuzhu Zura? Zuzu Dudek. Yeah, she was the best. Ah, I miss her. She didn't speak any English but God, was she funny. I used to tell her the wrong names for all the appliances and she would be like looking for the vacuum cleaner and she'd go to my mom, and she'd be like, "Have you seen ze cocksucker?" That's terrible. When she found out I was lying to her, she just like spanked me, and then quit. She spanked you? Really? Yeah, yeah.

No, no. It's not like that. I just... I wanted to stop by in person and tell you that, uh... You know, I can't see you anymore. So you came here to tell me you can't see me anymore? Yeah, I just thought it would be rude, uh... You know, not to stop by. You know, I wanted to give a chance to say something or if you want to talk about it? Oh? Well, thank you for letting me down in such a polite fashion. I'm very sorry. It's okay. Uh, I have to run, though. Oh, okay. Do you want to talk about it or... I mean, you're welcome to tag along, I guess. Yeah, sure.Okay. It's very gratifying to see this having such an emotional effect on someone. I'm Dallan Parcel. Colin. What are your thoughts? It's beautiful. It was inspired by the death of my daughter and wife. I'm sorry. Eerie, right? You could almost feel their presence here. I see you met Colin. I just did. And how did you come to join my daughter here? Uh, we're dating. What happened to the other one? He's still hanging around but... I'm not really. I'm sorry, Colin, if this is uncomfortable. Jessie and I are pretty candid about it. It's fine. All right. I'll leave you two alone. Colin, do the right thing. Excuse me? Do the right thing with my daughter. I don't care what you do, just do the right thing. Nice to meet you. What do you think? He's a nice man. About the installation. You know, it's intense. I like it. I don't always like his stuff, but... This one I like. I have... I have to tell you something. Okay. Listen, I just got out of prison. What for? I hit a guy with my car. It was an accident, he's in a coma. And if he doesn't wake up, then I might be charged with manslaughter. I know this must be really hard for you, but, uh... Why would it be hard for me? I don't know. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Were you drunk? No. No, it was an accident. You want to get drunk? Yes. You were pretty young when they died, right? Uh... Yeah. I was five. What was your sister like? You remember much? Remember a few things. Mostly what people tell me about her. She was a musician too. Wow. She was a perfect student, gorgeous. I think people only tell me the good things. Probably for the best. She married or anything? No. She was only 15. Cool. My dad gave me this guitar. He used to shower me in gifts after she died. Didn't know how to play it. Play any music? Me? No. It's too bad... Could've been a great musician. Really? I dunno. Country song?

I've just been so busy with all the Vita stuff. Yeah, you're still working with Barbara? Yeah. Yeah, oh, she's a great mentor. That's great. I'm really happy for you. How's life back in the real world? I'm raising myself up, you know... Just trying to keep my head down and get through this. What's your plan? Uh, you know, I don't really have a plan. I haven't thought that far ahead. Hey, I've been thinking of coming down to New York for a Vita conference. I'd love to see you. Yeah. Yeah, that... That would be great. I've missed you. I've missed you. I love you. Love you too. I just don't have any filters. What's wrong, hon? I just got the phone with Colin. I'm okay. I don't think I've had a real conversation with him since he was a child. Didn't help that I took him away from his father at the height of his puberty. Barbara, it's fine. I... I... I just want to say, things happen. God knows why. Things test us. The two of you, if you can get through this? He needs you, Dana. He is so lucky to have you. Look at that, no granules. Nice. Impressive.Thanks. I do my best. Who was that on the phone? Oh, that was a... That was a girl, who was... Was my fiance. What happened? After the whole accident thing, um... Things got really messy and... It's a long story but, um... I guess we never really talked about it, so... Um... That's why she called, so... So she didn't want to be a prison wife? Basically. Well... Hello? Jess, it's me.Fuck. Just a second.Who is that? You need to leave right now. Right the fuck now. I'm sorry, Colin. You've got a boyfriend? You just gotta go. I'm really sorry.He didn't... You didn't even buzz him up? He has a key. He has a key. You're not serious? No, I'm serious. Very serious. Go, go, go.What do I do now? I don't know. I usually just let these things work themselves out. This is crazy. I can't see you anymore. I'm sorry. Hey, buddy... Hey, hold it right there. Me? Yes, you. You're just gonna walk by me like that? Like what? Okay, what's the deal here, huh? You special or something? What's with the topless act? I just got locked out. Okay. Yeah. I was on the fire escape and window shut and couldn't get back in. You locked yourself out on a fire escape? Uh... I just want to get home. I was just heading to the train, is that all right? Oh, yeah? Where is home? Uh, Ridgefield. Connecticut? That's 60 miles from here. Yeah, it's fine. Sorry, am I in some kind of trouble or... You know what? Get in the car. No, I just... But I'm... Come on. Let's talk about it in the car. Are you sure? OFFICER: Yeah. Come on. Just get in. Get in. It's warm. Watch your head. Jesus Christ. What's this? Locked himself out of his house. Hey, it's chilly out there today. Are you one of those polar bear gay guys? What? This house you got locked out of, Yeah.someone else's house? Yeah, my friend. Look, uh, she kicked me out. It's embarrassing.What did she kick you out for? You do something? No, no. I didn't. There's another guy. Apparently, she likes him better. So she sent me out back... She's a musician.Ah. That's rough. Is he a beanie shopper? What's that? You know, one of those guys who lives in Brooklyn and wears beanies. A beanie shopper. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess so. That's rough.Yeah. Right, come on. Let's take him to 125th. Uh... No, wait, hold on a second. I actually didn't do anything wrong. Hey... Relax. 125th Street, train station. Oh.Sit back and relax. Enjoy the ride. Oh, great, thanks. Fear. Boy, that can just suck the air out of confidence in two seconds flat. But confidence is not the absence of fear. It's respecting that natural and innate instinct that is fear. Fear can fuel, fear can drive you along or it can drive you away. Ow, fuck! It can be utilized. It can be harnessed. It can be changed. And suddenly, you have confidence. Hey. I'm sorry. I know. I should have called, but... You're fired. Seriously? You can't fire me. Uh... I just did. Wait a sec. How do I get un-fired? Let's go. You're a dick. Okay. You good? They must have had a field day with you in prison. Brad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Brad. I'm sorry. El Jefe! Fill this out. I already filled one of these out. That was before I fired you. All right, whatever. I like your spirit. Yeah? Yeah. You can take a punch. You got that Glennon fighter in you. Yeah? Was my dad a fighter? No. But I am. So what do I have to do to get you to show up here on time? Want me to get you an alarm clock? No. I'm... Buy you a rooster? Brad, I'm sorry. All right? I just, I had a thing with this girl and then ended up staying... Oh, oh, oh... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! A girl? Yeah. Is she cute? She's very pretty. She redhead? No, she's blonde. Like, dirty blonde. Yeah, yeah, like dirty blonde. Cool. Anyway, it's over now. Which is probably a good thing since my parole officer said that I shouldn't even be in the city, so... Well, speaking of your parole officer, you might not have to worry about that anymore. What're you talking about? Let's just say I took care of it. Brad, what the fuck are you talking about? "Colin Glennon has a gift. "He has a gift for nature. "A gift for horticulture and a gift for working with a team." End quote. "Colin has created a new kind of grafting system "and has revolutionized my nursery." Etc, etc. "The other boys all look up to him with respect." Oh, this is my favorite. And I quote, "He is pretty much fluent in Spanish at this point, "which is quite impressive since he knew nothing "only three weeks ago." End quote. Cousin Brad. Excellent. What kind of bullshit scheme are you tryin' to pull here? I didn't have anything to do with that. I take this shit very seriously, Colin. You want to tell me what happened to your eye? Oh, sporting injury. A sporting injury. What sport were you playing? Uh... It's like a fighting kind of a sport. A fighting sport? Yeah. It's like boxing. But with less rules. It's how you gain respect. It's how you gain respect, huh? Mmm-hmm. Can I remind you of what you signed when you agreed to your parole? It says, "I will not affiliate or associate "with any gang member, "criminal organization, or individual member thereof." I like you, Colin. But you're making it very difficult to help you. And I understand that. Completely, Mr. Harrison, but you don't have anything to worry about. This is helping me.Yeah. This? Yeah. I feel a part of something. I mean, isn't that what some of this is about? I mean, don't I get a little bit of help, a little bit of lax here?

I don't really understand the importance of soil, but, apparently it's the secret to a good tomato. Really? Yeah. Hey, you can't just use the same soil as you would use for basil or lavender or perennials or anything like that. And, um, you can't water them too often. I also read that salt water makes them delicious but I think it also ruins the soil so... It's probably just a tradeoff. Trying a lot of new crap. We'll see how it goes.

I'm just, uh, visiting a friend. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Well, you know, these women, they are an example of the ability to change in the midst of so much fear. You know, fear of growing old and not making enough money and being alone, you know. And yet they attack it head-on. You know, there's nothing stopping these ladies, you know? And I find that... Find that very appealing. Well, I'm not sure everyone would agree with you on that, but... Yeah, well, you know, not everyone agrees about the truth but that's what the justice system is for. Right.

Let's have a warm Vita welcome, ladies, Dr. Harry Clark. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hello, ladies. Uh... It is a pleasure to be here. I'm Dr. Harry Clark. Today, I want to talk to you about examples. You know, perception. How you see things and how you perceive people. We each have a version of ourselves that we are... ...projecting. When you're sitting there in your chairs right now, and you look up on the stage, what kind of a person do you see before you? Do you think it's a regular person, just some guy, or, do you think it's someone that has a lot of confidence and a lot of swagger? I'm going to run a little bit of an experiment right now. So, I'm going to ask you guys to do something a little... A little strange, and that is, I'd like you guys to close your eyes. But, I'd like you to really close your eyes. I don't want any peek... I see you back there. No peeking. All right, just keep your eyes closed. I swear it's gonna be worth it. And I'll let you know when to open your eyes, okay? So... Now, open your eyes. What do you see now? How much self-worth does this man have? I'm just playing with you, but you get my point. I hope. Hey. Hey man, get out of here. I just want to talk to Jessie. No, man. Go home. Jessie. I'm sorry. I'll leave you alone, I promise you. Just let me explain.Just go home. Take your hands off me, man. Oh, my God. Jessie, just hear me out okay? It wasn't supposed to end like that. I was wrong. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, asshole, get off him What are you doing? I didn't know she was dead, all right? I hadn't seen her 15 years. I didn't know. Come here! I should have told you. I'm sorry. Why are you always causing trouble, huh? Put that back on your head, man. Your nose is bleeding. Are you listening to me? All right. Come on. Yeah, I know about you. That's your thing, right? Preying on girls with emotional baggage, so you can sleep with them. Going back to prison for a long time. Come on in. Stand up. Officer, I would be happy to give you my statement now. I was assaulted by this man. Mmm.hmm. This convict. You like fighting? No. No? It looks like you're getting pretty damn good. Well, that guy's an asshole. You're right. He is an asshole. But you're a bigger asshole. Me? Yeah. You. You know how I know? No. That's what I do all day long. I work with assholes. But you, Colin, you're a very special kind of asshole, because you can't see what's right in front of you. But you want everyone else to watch as you continue to make an asshole of yourself. You got it all. You got the family, you got the job, you got the cute girlfriend, but for some reason... You keep on wanting to break your parole. If you ask me, a punch in the face is exactly what you needed. Okay, well, I got that covered. You tagged him pretty good too. I did.Yeah. So I guess I'm going back to jail? Right there, Colin, hold on. Where's he going? Could have broke my nose. Sir, sir... Let me out of here? He... He assaulted me. Well, according to the statement that the girlfriend you both share gave Officer Dugan here, you swung first. He was threatening her. Oh. Tell your lawyer. I'll see you Thursday.Right. What happens with this? Oh, I don't think you have anything to worry about. It'll all settle out. Maybe not for this asshole, but... I'm sitting right here! Thanks.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take it easy all right? You're watching your figure? You were heavier as a child? I can tell. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You want us to drive you to the hospital? No, Mom, I'm fine. Take me to the train, please. How was the conference? Fine. How was the precinct? Fine. I think me being close to you is not a good thing right now. Well, you know, I think anyone being close to me is not a good thing right now. Stop that. Stop doing that. You're a good person and you need to stop hiding from it. Sorry. No, you're right.
