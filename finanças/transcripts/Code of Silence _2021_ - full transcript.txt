No, no, you won't have to go through Commander Du Rose or anyone else, you'll report directly to me. The case would make you the youngest Detective Superintendent in the history of the Metropolitan Police. You know that I'm not really interested in that sort of thing, sir. I don't know how I can say no more simply. I'm giving you another bite at these bastards, opportunities like this don't come very often. Don't you wanna finish what you started? The Krays have got the whole of the East End in a bloody muzzle, no one will go on the record. That's a pretty significant piece of the puzzle, sir. Well, if it's a puzzle, Nipper, then it must have a solution. You'll have the full weight of the Met at your disposal. If they didn't have so many of our men in their pocket, we wouldn't have to be here in a cupboard in a basement. I had to return a file. Well, can't blame me for trying. Now do me a favor, old chap and pop that in the Cornell box for me, would you? Sir. I'll see you upstairs. Please, please, please, please, please, please. Give me those. I reckon he's had enough, you know. Pardon? I'm just saying, if he grassed, he'd probably share the details, while he's still got the teeth to do it. He ain't a rat, if he was, he'd be dead already. - I just thought- - His brother. He started out with a girl, unless he's Scotland Yard. We thought we'd send him, and anyone else with the inclination to flap their gums, a little message. Get up, get up! No, no, no, no, no, no, please don't, please don't! I swear on my mother's eternal grave. Can you hear me? Hey, mister, who did this to you? I don't know, I didn't see a thing. Morning, guv. Cup of tea for you, guv? Are you, are you gonna finish this one? It's freezing, how long you been here? 5:53. Over 1000 witnesses. Just need to find one, who will talk. Easy to say, ey, guv? Here you are. Thanks, Frank. Nipper! No one knows we're here, guv. Hey! What's he doing here? Hey, guv, it's Commander Du Rose. Oh, shit! I'll go get him, you tell him to shut up and move their bloody cars. Fuck! Trev, turn that board round. Oi! Someone's coming down now. Get your cars out of sight. We've been driving around for half a bloody hour. Morning, sir, if I'd have known you were coming, I would have sent somebody to meet you. So this is where you've been hiding. Well, I wouldn't say hiding, sir. Come on then, let's see it. - Sir, excuse me. - Oh, what a tip. What's the latest, Superintendent? With all due respect, Commander, I don't report to you. It's Acting Deputy Assistant Commissioner as of Wednesday. Which way? This way. What happened to Brodie? Stroke, which doesn't alter that you now answer specifically, directly and promptly to me. Sorry, sir, just wasn't made aware. It's a surprise you're aware of anything all the way out here or us of you. Well, that's the way it needs to be. I'm sure I don't need to tell you, sir, that the Krays- Oh, let me stop you there. The whole East End might believe they have a direct line into the heart of Scotland Yard, but you know, as well as I do, that's a myth spread by the Krays themselves to discourage informants. Spoken like a true diplomat. Careful, Superintendent, the Krays are con men, not gangsters. What if you're wrong? Well, either way, this little circus is tied up in my predecessor's budget and since the Metropolitan Police have already paid for it, I'm not gonna be the one to throw it in the rubbish. Thank you, sir, we're just through here. Don't thank me quite yet though, I might not be able to reverse the mistakes I've inherited, but I can damn well modify them. Sir, we don't need any more officers at this stage. - Oh, well, that's fortunate. You two, gather your things, you're going back to your stations. Commander, these are, these are my boys, I trust them. What's wrong with us? And I'm sure they'll be discrete, once they've gone. You'll now work with officers that I trust to get the job done. Sir, c I have a word? In your office? Commander. Sir, once we start arresting villains, it's gonna, it's gonna get complicated. With all due respect to you and to them, I don't know these men. They're from Glasgow and Leeds, Nipper. Might as well be from the moon, as far as the Krays are concerned. What is it you're saying? He's saying he can rely on us and not you. Aye, how do I know I can trust him? You should do your homework before you run your mouth. You might want to start with the Great Train Robbery, fucking hell. Didn't help him bring down the Krays the first time. Ah, if I need to explain it to you, you must be a fucking idiot. Are you and I gonna have a problem? - Yeah, I hope so. - Alright, you two, back off! Sir, we haven't even started and he's- Nipper, it's done. We'll review your progress in two weeks. Meantime, I'd like daily update reports. Where's your stuff? - Car, sir. - What's it doing in the... Nevermind, get on with it. Well, come on, you two, plenty for you to do at the shop. You can sit wherever you like. If I see you threaten another officer again, by the time I'm through with you, you're gonna be begging me to throw the book at you, you understand? Tea and biscuits are over here, I'm milk and one. The heater's obvious, it gets bloody chilly in here. Oh, it's just a gift, sort of. I've only got a few pages in. Might be all you do get for a while. You'd better get reading, fellas. Oh, my God. And lads, there will be a test. Do me a favor and don't do that in here. You're surrounded by an entire decade of flammable police work, most of it only one copy. Nothing about this inquiry goes passed these four walls. Anybody asks you anything, you say nothing, including other officers, wherever their rank, whatever they ask you, you say nothing. Even on the job? Especially on the job, the Krays have ears everywhere. Well, we're fucked then. From another town, don't know anyone. They'll think we're a ghost squad dabbing other cops. Let them, it'll keep prying eyes away. The one advantage we have is that they don't know we're after them. We jeopardize that, then we're done for. Kiss goodbye to your social life, mate. Sergeant. You're about to take down one of the most ruthless organizations in Britain's history. You don't have a social life. Now tell me you understand. - Sir. Good. There's got to be 40 players up there. Yeah, and three of us. Better get started then. Morning. Morning. Bloody hell, does he even have a home? That's the last. Well done, boys. Basically it all boils down to two cases. If we're gonna send the Krays down once and for all and that is our mission, we have to crack these two. Jack McVitie, enforcer, missing since October '67. Owed the Krays money, that he didn't pay back. Yeah, we don't know what it was for, but we think they had him killed. George Cornell, on the evening of 9th of March, 1966. Cornell enters the Blind Beggar, a public house in Whitechapel with a mate, Albie Woods, also known to the police. What was he doing there? No one knows, Cornell was an enforcer for the Richardson crime family by blood. No one remembers seeing anything out of the ordinary, not till 8:40. They actually brought in Ronnie for an ID parade. The barmaid was supposed to attend a lineup, but she bottled it last minute. What did you see? I can't, I can't, I'm sorry. She definitely saw something. We don't know what she saw. His brain's all over the bar, for crying out loud. She's terrified, she knows what they're capable of. Well then, we need to make her more scared of us, than she is of them. You think carefully before you say another word. Oh no, I'm just saying, if you want me to push her a little bit. I thought I made it clear, that's not how I work, I was very specific. Nothing we do is worse than they're gonna get out of there. In here, it's a few hours, out there, it's the rest of their lives. What the fuck are we doing sitting around here with our thumbs up our arses leafing through mountains of shit any Tom, Dick or Harry could find out about the fucking Krays? We will do what we have to do to solve the case, we're- Hold on, what did you say? I'm sorry about the colorful language, sir, it's too- No, not that bit. He said that any Tom, Dick or- Dick or Harry could learn about the Krays, of course. Of course. We've been doing it the wrong way round for years. We don't investigate the murder. Then how do you expect to bang them up? No, no, that's still the end game, it's just not our next move. We, we learn about crimes and then we look for witnesses. Isn't that how it works? It can't be like that with the Krays, because people are scared for their lives, they're intimidated. We've got to do it the other way around, we've got to, we've got to find the witnesses and get it, get the witnesses to lead us to the crimes. Someone who can give us a thread, that we don't know, what no Tom, Dick or Harry could. It doesn't matter what it is, it just needs to be new information. We pull all this down and we start again, we create a timeline, any activity, anything at all, charged or suspected, we establish who is in and who is out of the Firm, but most importantly, when. To solve this, we don't look at the facts, the immovable, we look at what's changed. We redo the board, not in hierarchy, but in time. Forget persons of interest, I don't care who's close to the action, I want the opposite, I want to know who's dropped out of the frame. You see, they're not like us, we're, we're fluid, we're moveable, we're, we're designed to come and go, but they're not like that, they're solid, they're firm and only something very significant changes that, it's when someone leaves. Whoever leaves, that's who we've got a chance of squeezing, that's who we might, just might get to talk. Let's get started. Donoghue shouldn't be there. It says there, Reggie shot him in the leg in '64. Believe it or not, that was his route into the Firm, not out, see, that's what we're up against, he gets shot in the leg and he says nothing, it's a shame as well, 'cause he's the driver, he's seen the lot. Mickey Fawcett, claims he's out of the Firm, he runs a pub now near the steam ship in Silverlands. Ah see, that's down by the docks, that's Kray territory. He may be inactive, but he wouldn't be able to work down there, if there was bad blood, scratch him, which leaves us with Billy Exley. Moved out of East London, early '67, Norfolk. Maybe he fancied a view. Didn't think there were any views in Norfolk, it's all flat, isn't it? He's running. You're not wrong. He's finally acting. It's all very theatrical, Superintendent. Very cloak and dagger. We're just having a little chat, right? Either seat's fine. What the fuck is going on? You ain't Hitchcock, Nipper. What's wrong with a nice warm office, yeah? After you. We only want to pick your brains. Well, I've got a bad ticker, you know. We know. What are you trying to do to me? You know, these kitchens used to serve half the cafes in the borough. The stoves were over there and they used to hang the meat over there. You know, I've always wondered why do they have to hang game so long after it's dead, I mean, doesn't it go off? I actually don't know. Oh, that's odd, we assumed that having moved to the countryside last year, you'd taken up the noble sport of hunting. Leave it out. Can't think of why else you'd need this. That my gun? You break in my house? See, my missus lives there. My boy sleeps in that house. Why do you think we brought you all the way out here? There's no one, not the family, not the Firm, no one knows you're here, so you can calm down. Calm down? You're out of fucking order. I ain't done nothing. So what's your quarry, Exley? Is it a brace of duck on the Glorious 12th? Yeah, fuck you, Nipper. You got no right going in my house. That's B&E, got you for that. You know, if we can get in, you've got to think who else can and what they might get up to, if they do. If you hadn't wanted to talk, you could have told us that from the comfort of your own doorstep and yet you let us drag you all the way down here, why is that? Why is that, Billy? You need them put away, as much as I do. What happened, Billy? Why'd you get so scared? I'll put my trust in that, before I put it in you. We can protect you. - Who's the trainee? - Forget about him, I'll get rid of him, talk to me. I ain't no grass. You're only a grass, if we make it official. Alright, fuck off. What do you want? You see, now we can be just two fellas having a conversation. I can't use anything that you don't sign. That's the law. The law? That word don't mean nothing to the twins. That's why your mob's always gonna lose. So are you gonna tell me what you know? Whatever you say. If you can't use it, I'll say whatever you like. I don't believe this, where's my book? Will someone give me my fucking book? It's on the bar, Ron. What the fuck is it doing there? It's got everything in that book, don't just leave it lying around for anyone to pick up. I'll get it. Right. See that? Well, read it. Lesley Payne. No, read what it says. - Lesley Cunting Payne. - Lesley Cunting Payne. You know what that means? - Yes, Ron. - I want him fucking dead, dismembered, fileted, flayed on the bed of the Thames, do you hear me? Yes, Ron. Don't, "Yes, Ron," you set of wet bollocks. You need me to make it official? I don't want your money, Ron. It's not mine, it's yours and you take that soggy sack of shit next to you an all. I don't want to see either of you, unless it's honking out Payne's scalp. Hold on, why did Ron want Payne dead, what had he done? Sweet fuck all. He wanted out, told them he wanted no more to do with them. Nothing half the Firm haven't thought about and you kill a man for that? You tell me. So we got tooled up and we went to see Payne. Hello? I'm afraid my husband's out at a meeting, he shouldn't be too long. Would you like to come in for a cup of tea? So like I says, he wasn't there. So you just sat there? Jack wanted a cup of tea. Lovely cup of tea, Mrs. Payne. Now what was it you wanted with my husband? Can I give him a message? I weren't about to get family involved, never have. We never said nothing. He never knew what he'd missed. And that's it? Then we went for a pie. That's your confession, you didn't kill someone and then you went for a pie? Can I have my gun back now please? So you bought this? No, borrowed it off a mate for three bob. Sugar? No, ta. It's not even the same model, but he was so wound up, he never even noticed. Nipper's little set up did that for him. Yeah, clever the guv using that room. Hm. I wouldn't want to get stuck in a lift with him, there's no doubting he's got some brains. Yeah, did a bit of spade work, bloke never finished school and still becomes the youngest ever to make Detective Superintendent. Just imagine what he could do with an O level. Some drive, I'll give him that. As long as we're being led in the right direction. Well done, boys. He cough up? No, I don't think he ever had any intention of doing so. You don't think he'll go back to the twins? No, he's terrified of them. Then what are you looking so pleased for? He doesn't know what he gave us. I thought you said he gave you nothing. Well, it doesn't mean I didn't take it, our new talker, Lesley Payne. The accountant? Never heard of an accountant doing a murder. Then you never had an accountant. Like I said, we're not after murderers anymore, we're after talkers and maybe our accountant will talk. What are you looking so happy about? Oh, Al Capone, guv, they got him on his accounts. Yes, they did. I guess that makes us the Untouchables, sir. I guess it does. I told you I'm an accountant and as such my part in the Krays' businesses was advisory, pertaining mainly to financial investments and the like, I simply don't know about anything disagreeable. You see, I don't believe you. Running the money puts you at the center of everything they've ever done. Whatever you think, I don't know the things you want me to know. Oh, it doesn't matter what I think. But if I was you, I would care very much about what Ronnie Kray thinks. Do you like to read, Mr. Payne? Excuse me? I do, anything I can get my hands on. We didn't have books growing up, I think that's why they fascinate me so much. I'd sneak them out of school, my satchel ready to burst. We had this teacher, Mr. Sturridge, he was my history master, he caught me stealing from his class. - Nipper! - I was petrified. You know what it's like, trembling. You put your hand out and you're, you're ready to, to get the rod, but instead of getting the cane, he puts in my hand a book, "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." I ran home and devoured it within a weekend. Isn't it ironic, that that moment of theft led to me wanting to become a detective? Something about the way that Edward Gibbon separated the fact from the fallacy. He solved the puzzle of the past, despite not being there. You think they'll ever write a book about us? Be a jolly boring read from what I can tell. You see, I'm not so sure. What if I was to tell you that you're already in a book? It's a fascinating one by all accounts about so big, full of details, dates, places, times and names all wrapped up in a nice, black cover. Inside, the owner of the book has written their name, do you want to know what it says? It says "This book is the property of Ronald Kray." Do you want to know what it's about? There's lots of chapters, my favorite one is called "The Shotgun and the Accountant." With him bleeding out in the arms of his ever loving wife. Did she ever tell you about the two men, who came to visit her last year? Let's call her and ask her about it. Please, please, don't bring her into this. I don't want to call her, but do you ever wonder who they were or what they wanted or more importantly, who sent them? Ronnie Kray is like a dog with a bone. He's had a taste and he's never gonna stop wanting it. Tell me what I have to do. How's he doing? Grab me a Section 71. Really, what did he say? Nothing yet, but he wants to, wants to give it all up, but not until we show him his immunity. - Where is he? - He's downstairs. I mean, I think we really might have, Lilly, it's Nipper. I know, I'm good, love, thank you, can you put me through to Du Rose? Can you fill that out for me? He's, he's where? Oh, right, yeah, thanks, love. He's at bloody dinner, Scott's in Mayfair, la-di-bloody-da. I'll take it to him here, don't worry about that, I'll do it. No, you go and get him and bring him here, it'll be quicker, Payne's on the edge and I don't want him thinking for too long. Sergeant, don't take no for an answer. Yes, sir. Nipper, what couldn't wait, that I had to cut short a dinner with the Home Secretary? I'm not signing this. He's on the ropes, sir, we've got him. He's an accountant, not a boxer. He-he's got enough to put them away. How long for? Long enough to loosen some lips and then others will turn Queen's evidence and we'll strike a deal for the real stuff. Sir, it's a start. And if no one talks like last time and the time before that? Once they realize that they're not untouchable, they'll open up. - No one's gonna open up over tax evasion charges, hardly gonna make the front pages, hm. Sorry, what are we trying to do, are we chasing villains or headlines? Watch it, we're on the same side, you condescending prat. Now you're gonna bring them up on murder under the Queens peace with malice aforethought, express or implied, or I will find someone who will. And where are my bloody daily reports? Take me back to my meeting, Sergeant. John, without Payne, we're back to square one. Superintendent, you never left square one. Come on, Sergeant, if we're quick, I might make it back for dessert. What's he got against you, guv? I don't know. Nothing. He's so terrified of making a decision in case he has to take responsibility for a wrong one. It's what happens as you climb up, you get fearful for the fall. You could do a lot worse than follow his example, if you want to get on. So what do we do about Payne, guv? Well, we may have lost him and Exley, but we're not done for yet. Well, the Firm don't know we're onto them, so we'll go back to the files, we pick them apart, then we get someone to talk. Right, but what about Payne, sir? Oh, Christ, um, are you alright to give him a lift? - Yes, sir. - Oh, right. Thanks. Another Saturday morning. Wait, the guv's car's not here. You don't think... You say what you like, we'll walk in, he'll be sitting right there where he always does with a new list of brainwaves. He's not here. We've actually beat him. Hey, hand it bloody here. - Alright. Come on. Double or quits, if you can find out why he wears a ladies watch. Give over. Get out of his arse. He wears a woman's watch, don't tell me that's not suspect. Morning. No car today, guv? It was made in 1928. It's amazing, it keeps perfect time. Sir, we couldn't help noticing. That it's a ladies watch? Yes, sir. That's very observant. You know, you should apply that rigor to the current case, we'll have this thing wrapped up by Monday. Yes, sir. What time does that cafe open on Saturdays? Mr. Farlow's? Er, seven. Grab your coats, I'm taking you for brekkie. And what, it's about bloody time we got a decent cup of coffee. We can bring them back in one of those new polystyrene cups. You know, I don't get the point of those. What? They're magic, light as you like, keeps the tea warm as long as you need, disposable. Yeah, but why don't you just drink the tea in the cafe? 'Cause I want to bring it here. But we've got tea here and a kettle and water and mugs. What if I was going somewhere that didn't? Well, then you just drink it in the cafe. You watch, everyone will be drinking like that. I've forgotten my fags, I'll catch you up. Who's this? Get rid of her. - Morning, madam. - Superintendent Read? You can't be in here, madam, this is an ongoing police investigation. I know, that's exactly why I'm here. I must ask you to leave. I ain't going anywhere, until I've spoken to Superintendent Read. I'm Read. I don't appreciate being given the run around, Mr. Read. Quite. I'm Sylvia McVitie, Jack McVitie's wife. Lord knows, Jack wasn't always on the level, right, he could be a real bastard, I admit, even to me, but that's no reason to excuse what those evil twins done. What makes you think that the Krays killed your husband? Well, I'm not stupid, I know what happened, he didn't pay them off, so they done him. - The fact is that our- - No, I'm not finished, Mr. Read, so can you imagine my heart, when I'm told that someone's after him, when someone's gonna get justice for my Jack? - Excuse me, I- - I'm told you're doing a police investigation for Jack's murder and do I have anything to say? Well, too right I do, I've got a lot to say. Who was it, was it a posh gentleman with gray hair and a mustache? No, he was Scottish in his forties driving a Morris. - When was this? - Last week. So all week I wait in, all week. I don't want to go out, in case I miss him, I've got my neighbors going to get me fags for me, nothing. So I get on the phone to your lot at the Yard. Please tell me you didn't- Give me the right runaround, they did, "I'm just transferring you now, "I'm just putting you on hold, Mrs. McVitie. "Can I put you through to someone else, blah, blah, blah." I must've spoke to about a million different people, before finally I spoke to someone called Du Rose. Lovely man and he sends me over here to you. What happened to you two? I got all the way there. That's him. Oh, shit. Where the bloody hell have you been? I've been waiting indoors all week for you. Well, don't you think Mrs. McVitie deserves an explanation? What were you doing? I mean, I expressly told you, you know what I told you. Sir. Now every desk in Scotland Yard knows what we're up to, every pub in East London is talking about us, you've killed us! - It's not his fault. Then who's bloody fault is it? Get your stuff, you're done. Fine. - Superintendent. - Shut up! You disobeyed a direct order! Bloody hell, Al, it's not even that, it's... You know it was stupid! Flushed the entire investigation down the toilet. Okay, I'm going. Not to mention putting the welfare, possibly even the life of a civilian in danger! - Just tell him, mate. - Tell me what? It isn't his fault. Oh, oh, this should be bloody good. Um, Du Rose. When I drove him back to the dinner, he told me that if I found a way to jumpstart the investigation... What did he offer you? Bloody hell. What was I supposed to do, sir? He outranks you. And you knew about this? I mean, that was over a week ago. Du Rose ordered us to report back to him all along. And did you? Listen, thanks, mate, you're a savior. - You're still here? - Sir? Look, I know I made a mistake and I'll understand if you still want me gone, but I found somewhere safe for Mrs. McVitie to stay, it's out in Aylesbury, a mate of mine from back home, nothing to do with the Met or the Krays. If that woman ends up in the bottom of the Regent's Canal, you, the two of you, you've got blood on your hands. Understood. And now? - I've got no choice. - Sir, stop, don't call this off. Fuck's sake, sir, don't pull the plug, we can still talk to Du Rose. - It's Nipper. I need some bodies for a swoop, 16 primary locations, all East and up to 10 secondary. You're not gonna forgive me for this, but it's tomorrow, dawn. 30, 3-0 officers, yes, you heard me right with a dozen rated for firearms. No, Frank, I know it's short notice. Guv, what's going on? Al? Frank, that is brilliant. Thank you, no, I know he's gonna find out, but it will be too late. I will call you in an hour with details, yes. Thank you. You're bringing in the Krays? The Krays, all of them, the whole damn Firm. Our cover's blown, they know we're coming after them. If we don't bring them in now, they'll evaporate. Alright. My mother gave it to me. She doesn't need it anymore? Not since I was four years old. Listen, listen. Police, don't move, stay where you are! Ronald Kray, you are under arrest. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense, if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. And couldn't you have waited till after breakfast? Call me. Oi, you fucking pig, hands off him, you cunt! Get off! Get off! Nice job, you plonker. Come on. Du Rose, wandering around Scotland Yard handing out cigars, claiming he's taken down the Krays. We've got till nine tomorrow to charge someone. He's gonna go berserk, when he finds out we've got nothing on them. - No, he isn't. - Sir, he is. No, 'cause we're gonna find something to put on them and we're gonna make it stick. - In 24 hours? And by the way, we haven't got nothing. We've got something that nobody's ever had before and that is the Krays and the Firm in custody together. I don't care if it's triple murder or parking tickets, we've just got to keep them off the streets, until we find something to nail them with, start at A and go through to Z and Sergeant, you can sweat them hard, but I don't want any accidents. Well, that's the thing about accidents, sir, you don't see them coming. What about K, sir? I'll deal with K. Well, have a seat, Superintendent. Here we are again, back for more punishment. Do you hate yourself or something? How's your day going so far? Pretty good as it goes, got nearly a score of villains locked up. Illegally detained. The law gives me 24 hours, that's 17 crooks for 24 hours, that's 408 hours of quality conversation. Now that's a lot of talking, Ron, or it would be, if any of them actually spoke. Oh, you can talk to them as long as you like, Superintendent, they won't talk back, 'cause real friends don't turn their backs on their own kind. I hear Jack McVitie's not very sociable these days. Oh, the Hat? Last I heard, he was living in Spain. Must have a lovely tan by now. By now? Interesting, when did he leave us? They say he owed you quite a bit of money. Who's they? What was it, a monkey? That's a lot of bread. For a tie clip, maybe. I mean, you see, that's what I don't understand. Someone who owes you money wandering around, sorry, lying about getting a tan on the Costa Del Sol. I mean, that can't be good for business. We'll have to try and forgive him, Ron. Some people just read too much into the rubbish they see splattered across the newspapers. Whoever you've been talking to clearly ain't one of us. I wouldn't worry, Ron. I don't think Nipper knows very much about old Jack the Hat. As a matter of fact, I don't think Nipper knows very much about anything. If he doesn't charge us with something in the next, how long's left now? I'm gonna take a guess, say 20 hours, won't be long before we can familiarize ourself with whoever's been poisoning Mr. Read's ear. Maybe if they just got to know us a little better, they'd realize quite how mistaken they were. Now that sounds like a threat. Oh, we don't make threats, Mr. Read, that'd be rude, much like your allegations about our business. Let's talk about your business then. We're just trying to make our way in our manor. You see, we come from nothing, Mr. Read, nothing, flogging old rags door-to-door, pennies. You can't blame a bloke for trying to improve his situation. Do me a favor, the hard luck working man ticket, really? I would've thought you of all people would understand. Your old man having to pull you out of school, 'cause he couldn't afford the uniform. Oh, what, you thought you were the only one, who'd done your homework? We know all about you, Leonard. Working man, short stint in the forces, handy boxer. You're just like us. Except you're not, you're nothing like us. You turned your back on your own kind. Do you know what they call people like that? It's called a fucking traitor. I knew a guy like that in Long Grove once, self-destructive behavior, it's called. Apparently it stems from unresolved grief. How'd you cope growing up without your mum? Do you ever wonder why she was taken from you? Do you ever lie awake at night wondering why you couldn't have had one more year? One more week? Why she left you? Why she gave up so easily? Maybe it's because she couldn't stand the fucking sight of him. Come on then, you fucker, let's have it right now. Pick one of us, we'll do it right here, winner walks out. Now that's why your old man farmed you off the second the dirt hit her grave. We've still got our people and our mum. She loves us very much. I'm gonna take you down, the both of you. Tell you what, you've got the smarts to make a good fist of it, I'll give you that. Hiding out here wasn't a bad idea, but you ain't gonna win. You've got the brains, you sure as hell ain't got the stomach for it. You don't know me very well. No one's gonna talk to you, Nipper, for the simple fact that they like who we are and they don't like who you are. That ain't ever gonna change, no matter how fucking tricky you get. Fuck off! Go on then. Fruity. She's there. She's going out later. - Are you sure about this? - Course I'm not sure. Just say the word and we pick them back up. Go now before I change my mind. Please, whatever you think I've- Ssh! Pick a number between one and 10. I don't understand. Number! Don't look at him. Between one and- - I don't, six. Good. Good, she's got it. Now, I'm going to give you six chances to tell me why you're here. I don't know what you're talking about. One. I-I don't know what you mean. Two. I promise you, I haven't said a word. Please, just, just let me go. Three. What do you want from me? Four. I don't know what you want. Put her on the chair. No, no, no, please don't hurt me. No, no, no! No, please! Keep her still. I haven't said anything, I promise, I haven't said a word. Five. Whatever happened had nothing to do with me. I never said anything to anyone. For someone who never said anything to anyone, you don't half do a lot of talking. Hold her wrists. - She doesn't know! - Do it! Six. She'll tell Mr. Kray, I didn't say anything about that night, I wouldn't say a word. I know better than to give him up, his secret's safe. Stop! Let go of her! Step away from her, Sergeant. She saw it all, she saw Ronnie that night. Go on, both of you, get out of here! She named him, guv. Obstructing the course of justice is a serious crime, miss. They were officers? What the fuck? I'd like you to make a statement for me. You think I'm gonna talk to you now? You already have. We know you know. They'll kill me. Not if we put them away. You really think you can do that? I've already nicked them. Help me finish this. Do I have a choice? You're a disgrace. You could've sent her the other way! I feel sick. - It was a calculated risk. - It was bang out of order! What does it matter, if it works? You let them do that to me? If you could take me through what you saw that night, the night George Cornell was shot in the head. Every time a door slams or a glass breaks, it's like that gun goes off over and over again. You know, sometimes when I close my eyes... I'd been on since six, when we opened, strangely the night started quiet. I didn't even notice who it was, when they walked in. Well, look who's just turned up. It was only when they said the name. The great Ron Kray. He looked right at me, smirking. It was like anyone would think he'd cashed a slip in at the bookies, not shot a fella in the face. It makes me sick even now, just, I can't, I can't sleep most nights, because... He's there, when I close my eyes, Ronnie Kray grinning. Except he's pointing the gun at me. I-I just, I-I can't- - It's alright, it's alright, that's enough. With what you've just told me, we can put Ronnie away for the rest of his life. You mean that? I mean it. That Ian Barrie was there too, waving his gun round like a lunatic. That's enough, that's more than enough. What, what about the other one? Reggie. Because of you, you've given me time to be able to work on him. Wait, you said you had them both. We do, yeah. So, so what do you mean work on him? Like what, what happens to me, if it doesn't work? Like I said to you, you're safe. Any involvement of yours will be completely confidential. Any official records you'll be listed as, as, as Mrs. X, no one will ever know that you were the one, who gave evidence. - You're an idiot. Who else they gonna think it is, when they hear what I have to say? But we are so close. That dream of mine, that wasn't a dream at all, it was a premonition. - No, no, that's not true. If one of them is out, he won't stop, until he finds the person responsible for banging up his brother. So no, until you have Reggie, there's no way I'm telling anyone what I just told you. Without her on the record, we're empty. Nothing sticks. They'll muck us about for the next 10 hours and then we'll have to let them go. We're this close and yet we couldn't be further away. What do we do now? I'm sorry lads, I'm out of ideas. It's not your fault, sir. Do you want me to go and release them? Thank you, Sergeant. No, fuck them. I mean, if we can't charge them, at least let them wake up with a bit of cramp. Sir. We have to let them go at nine, so we've got under an hour, come on. "Just 'cause you're paranoid "don't mean they're not after you." So you have read it? What are you two talking about? It doesn't matter that no one broke the code of silence, only that the Krays think that someone has. So we pick a patsy? No, Sergeant, we get the Krays to do it for us, all on their own, straight from the horse's mouth and then we swoop in and we offer immunity. But because it was the barmaid, that gave us the information and not actually one of them, we get Du Rose to sign a Section 71 Immunity Agreement and then we've got them. But how are we gonna do that? Alright, Nip. Only he gets to call me that. Come and have a look at this. Not too small for you? It's perfect. Yep. If this doesn't work, we're all going down. Oh, ye of little faith. How far forward did he want this? An hour, he said. Alright, let's bring them in. Cup of tea, that's all I want. I want a paper as well. - What's happening here? - Don't know. Give two stars overall. What's happening here? You cheeky bastards! Hey, hey, hey, don't walk off! There's no doors out here, hey! Clock's set, guv. Alright, let's get this done. About time. Come on. Hey, that's Ian Barrie. Where are they taking him? - Blah, blah, blah, blah. - Where the fuck are we going? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Where the fuck are we going? Have a seat, gentlemen. Naughty, naughty, Nipper, your 24 hours have been and gone. The situation's developed. Developed? You'll see. No one said nothing and no one's gonna, no matter how long you keep us. Come on, Reggie, we're off. No more last words? George Cornell on the other hand, his words were very revealing. Now don't say a word, Ronnie. You must think we're daft. Come on. Yes, you get the same deal, solicitor's on their way. He'll confirm, when he gets here. What you talking about? What the fuck is going on? Where you taking Albert? He's bullshitting, Ron, let us out. I mean, you're right, Donoghue might not cut the perfect deal, but there's always Ian Barrie. Oh, now, why the fuck? Don't say a word, Ron. There's no deal to be cut. But someone must've spoken, mustn't they? 'Cause otherwise, how would I know what Cornell said to you right before you shot him in the head Ron? Shut your mouth. You think it went something like, "Well, just look who's turned up, the great Ron Kray?" He's bullshitting, Ron, all of it, he's having us on. But you've got to ask yourself, right, how would I know that? You tell me. You must have a grass. Leave it. You fucking what? - Hey, Ron, drop him! - Don't you fucking touch me, or it'll be the last thing you do. You tell me the truth, who have you spoken to? You don't think I don't see what you're trying to do? You're trying to get inside here. Trying to tear us apart. Well, it won't work. Now who grassed? The truth this time. Frustrating, isn't it, when people don't speak? Tell me! It was the barmaid, the barmaid from the Blind Beggar. - What? - She turned you in. Why ain't you charged me then? Guvnor! Guv, what have you done? We've signed that woman's death warrant. They were gonna see the mic, I had to make a choice in the moment. They got me. Fucking hell, Ronnie. Something don't feel right, him giving up a witness like that. Oh, it was either that or he'd piss his pants. No, all the same. But he's too stiff to keep us here after he should. No, he's fucking got something, I know he does. I should've choked the life out of the scrawny pig, when I had the chance. You ain't half interested in him. It's easy, we get one of the boys to take one for the Firm. We get one of the boys to take one for the Firm. I'll have a mug sing for us. It might be better, if you do it. What in God's name is going on here? I'll get out, I'll deal with that- Are you recording them? What are you thinking? Turn this off. But you're in it an all. Turn it off. You're breaking the law, Superintendent, all of you. It's completely legal, we're not recording. So tell me what the bloody hell you're doing. Please, sir, I just need one moment. Please. Who's it gonna be? It's Albert Donoghue. No, he's listening anyway. If it weren't for him, we wouldn't be here. So you want me to tell him? No, we'll do it together. I'm gonna sue these pigs for every fucking penny they've got. Jesus, man, get him out of there, before they kill him. I want them all released, water, toilet visits, whatever they want. What are you waiting for? You get the water. I'll make double sure they get to use the toilet, those that need to, sir. I always said you had a bright future, Sergeant. If the slightest sliver of this debacle comes back to bite us, you'll regret you ever joined the force. What, you gonna hold it for me an all? Shit. What do you want? You know what I want, just like you know, when the Krays turn on you, there's no going back. Maybe tomorrow, maybe in a year, your time with the Firm is borrowed. You set them up. I'll put them right. You're gonna negotiate with the Krays for your life? Well, you ain't left me no choice. There's always a choice. Take the offer, Albert, before it's too late. You had us all along, didn't you? Did we? Course you did. Just needed someone to go on record. Can we count on you? Where do you want me to start? Why don't we start at the beginning? It's got to be done away from the Yard with a small team from the regions and I'm gonna need a warehouse.
