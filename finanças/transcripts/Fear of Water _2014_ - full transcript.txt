I bet you are nice and clean down there. Please... just leave me alone. Leave me. Hey! What's your problem? Nothing! What is your problem? You. Picking on her! What the fuck are you doing? Nothing! Yeah. Well, unless you want this wreaked around your head you fuck keave her alone! Do you know what? This place stinks of virgins. Yeah, you know all about that, will you? Yeah, I would by then. Really? Won't go near you with a bat you ugly fuck. Do you know what mate? Just allow this man. Let's just go. Don't fucking touch me. And you, Philip you're just a fucking none just like your old man. And you put your fucking shirt on. You look like a pepperoni in a cat, prick! Are you alright? What are you doing down here by yourself? I don't know. Are you hurt? Was that you? What was me? Was it you who called the ambulance last night? Gainsborough Lane? Yeah... Yeah, that was me. I'm Alexia. Eleanor. So what was wrong with her then? I don't know. I had a auntie that was ill when I was younger. Had to go to the hospital every day after school. I wasn't allowed in the room for very long because my dad wanted to be alone with her because it was his sister and that. Had to wait in this waiting room. And they had toys and books and stuff though. it was so boring. I must have looked in same book fifty times. She took ages to die. I used to come with my grand to feed the ducks when I was little. They must miss you then because no one ever does it anymore. Well... I better get going. Is not a bit late to be delivering papers? Ahh, it's just me. It takes a while. You can came if you want. Nice houses around here. I live just around the corner. Where do you go to school? Wentworth Manor. Fucking hell! Is it all girls? What? Your school...is it all girls? Yeah. So I don't think you have a boyfriend then? No. Those two prick down the lake. Both their old men are in prison. Really? Yeah. The one with no top on his dad stabbed somebody outside of the park over thirty quid or something. Oh, life! The other, Philip. His old man really is a criminal. If that's you with your papers again you can fuck off! I don't want you around here. Do you understand? I know who you are and I know where you live! And you, your little bugger! Eleanor! Is that your old man? Yeah! I better go. Listen, thank you so much for helping me. It's alright. Eleanor! Look after yourself. I'm sorry. Do you think this is the time to be causing me stress? Is it!? I won't do it again. Martin can this... It's not a perfect time. I can't sign off on papers I've not seen. Right... I have to go away again tomorrow. So I'll send someone to keep an eye on you. Ok. Who? I don't know yet. Right, get that out. Take that down. I don't like them. But that's just my art project. I don' like it. It's not your room. Don't argue with me, please. You are not gonna open this? I haven't felt like it. Suit yourself. I'm not going yet so if there's anything you need. A phone? We've spoke about this. All my friends have one. When you've passed your exams. Please! No. You want something for school perhaps? Well, have a think. - Good night. - Good night. Happy Birthday, Poppet. Hope this is useful. Love, Gram. I've told you before I don't want you around here. I warned you. Back in a few days. Someone will be over. No leaving the house. Eat open food first. - Eleanor: i could come and help if u want? - Harriet: Not allowed! Grounded! Harriet: See everyone at the party later! I can't wait. It's going to be wicked! What for? Who's there? Tyson, you little tike! Hey, you! Hey! Hey! Sorry, I thought you were out. What's going on? I kinda need somewhere to hide. Okay. Hang on. What happened? I pissed someone off. Wow! Nice house. Looks like a doll's house. I've got a doll's house. Of course you do. Ah...This is where you are, is it? Porche bitch, yeah? Can't believe he actually followed me. Is he crazy? He's keeping his fucking dog chained up. No wonder the poor thing is always in bad mood. - I know you're in there! - Prick! - That's horrible. - Are you go out? Have you got a dog? Yeah. JJ. Got him rescued. Poor thing only got three legs. I've got all day. - I think you don't have one? - I can bloody wait. No, I was never allowed. That's shit. I know all about you. The old Bill know as well. And if they don't, I'll tell them. I'm patient, me. I'll blooddy wait. Do you want something to eat? Do you like hummus? I don't know. Like it? Mmm. Can you use a drink? What the fuck are these? Ah, it's papaya. My dad's. It looks like it should taste really good but actually, it doesn't. Oh, carefully. That's his last one. I'll just put it back, he won't notice. Do you think? Yes. I'm so sorry! Can I get you t a cloth or something? You're so dead. No, I really didn't mean it. Too late. No, I didn't mean it. Bean press. Yes but mine was an accident. It's not fair. Seriously. Stop it. No, it is too late. You are dead. Don't be ridiculous! Ok, you surrender? Yeah. What the... Oh my God... So when is your dad came back? He didn't say.

Oh my God, you got a pool! It's a bit dirty. Don't mind, do you? No. Cold? It's nice! It's not been used for a while. I can't believe you have a pool and you don't even use it. Are you sure you want to stay? Yeah. Why? You don't want me to? No, it's not that. It's just... Will your parents wonder where you are? No. Ah fuck, my battery. Can you owe...? I don't have a phone I can lend you, sorry. What do you mean you don't have a phone? Not allowed. Dad's rules. I can give you one if you want. Really? I got a phone you can have. It's not the best, but.. No no, that's great. Thanks. Alright. Getting in then? No. I don't swim. Don't or can't? Either. How come? I just don't. You are a good swimmer. Thanks. Do you ever swin in the sea? No. Not even on hollidays? No. Never really had a propper one. What do you mean? Not with like beaches and that. If you could go anywhere where would you go? Don't know. Come on. If you could go anywhere? Anywhere in the world where would you go? I don't know. Never thought about it. Well, where have you been? Nowhere really. Have you ever been on a plane? No. Have you ever been abroad? Nope. Oh. I've been to Flockton. What's in Flockton? Prison. Don't! Get in here! I said don't! I'm gonna drown myself. What? Alexia! Alexia! Alexia! Not funny! Really really not funny! Why didn't you dive in and saved me? I'm going inside. I'm just playing! How did you get up there? How do you think? You can see a lot from up here, you know? I have never been out this far. If I lived here, I'd be out here all the time. Come and sit up here with me. Come on. Come on! Come see up here. I can't. Look, come this way. I'll give you a hand. Come on. I've got you. Well done. How funny that you deliver papers in my street. It's not my best clients on this street. What? Nothing. I've met a fair few characters on this job. Really? Oh yeah. Number 11, opposite you, old war hero. He pissed on Hitler's grave or something. Loads of medals. My granddad had loads of them. He still got actually. Hm, who else. There's number 15,down the road. Got locked up for 10 years for something he didn't even do. When they found out, they let him out and give him a shit load of cash and he bought the house with it. Wow. And number 17. Ex-pornstar. She had a huge following in the 70's. Still lives of royalts. Ok, that one is probably not true but is my favourite. I had no idea there were so many interesting people around here. Oh, yeah. They are everywhere. You'd never be able to see from down there. Go on. You don't act like a spoiled cow. That's because I'm not. Right. I'm not. It's alright. I ain't judging. Just take your time with it. God, I'm not spoiled alright. If you wannna see spoild you should walk around my school for a day. So what have you done with boys? What do you mean? Well, I guess you're a virgin but you must have done something. Yeah. Alright. What? Have you ever touched them or they ever touched you? Yeah. Okay. Have you ever had a cock in your mouth? What? Have you ever sucked a boy of? It's alright if you haven't. Oh, yeah. Once. OK. How? What? Show me how. Show you? Yeah. Use your thumb or something. No I... I'm just messing with you. Are you enjoy that? Mmmm. First fag? Why do you think that? 'Cause otherwise you would tell the difference. Really? No. What? You're high already. No I am not. I'm fine. Don't fall out the tree. Shit. You scared me. You didn't wake me. No. Is this her room? That was, yeah. You know my dad is probably just gonna throw this stuff away. Well why don't we move it first then? Where do you want it? Under the bed. Do you fancy watching a film? Alexia? Eleanor! Oh my God! Hello, how are you? Aunt Helen..would you like some tea? So where is your daddy? Somewhere to do with work. That figures. Didn't he tell you? Of course not. So I love what he's done with the place. I don't think he's done anything. I was being ironic, sweetheart. I mean, that radio is older than you. So when can we expect his majesty back? He didn't say. Hum...of course not. Are you expecting someone? Hello, Joanne Priestley. I was sent to watch Eleanor. I came yesterday, but nobody was here. Hi. I'm Helen Carrington. I'm Eleanor's aunt. - Nice to meet you. May I come in? - No. I mean...well, no. The thing is she doesn't need to be watched anymore. Oh.. Big change of plans. 'Cause, well, you know, her father works in law, right so he's really, really busy and he's kind of forgetful. I see. Well, I haven't been informed. I'm informing you now. - There is a 24 hour cancellation policy. - Right. My call out fee is ?53. Okay. Well, I should tell Mr. Carrington to expect an invoice. Could you also please tell him we really apreciate some notice next time... Ok, thanks. Bye. Have you eaten? Yes, thanks. Well, I haven't. So, get your coat on. You're coming with me. 'Cause I bet I can persuade you to have some dessert? OK. You do have keys, right? Isn't this great, girls? In the fresh air. Stretching our legs. Now I think, ok? If we cross here over the fence and go down there then we hit the road. You should have brought your car. Yeah, you know I don't like her as much as I liked the last one. Your old mini? Yes! You remember. How comes? Well, she was a classic. And a classics never age, you know. They are like... Classic. Anyway, I had her for 20 years and I was very, very sorry to say goodbye to her. Why is it "her"? What darling? Like when people talk about cars it's always her and she. My uncle used to do it about his motorbyke. Why is that? Well, my dears, I'll tell you. It is because we are the more beautiful and the more graciful. I mean, my god, imagine calling Dorris after a man! I can't imagine. So you call your car Dorris? Yes, look, I know it seems silly now but when I first got her then... well, I was going out with a boyfriend and he used to call me Dorris because well, because he thought I was gipsy. Can you imagine? So what happened to her? Sometimes you have to let things go. Raise your back! Go! I like your aunt. She's allright. A bit wiz but... Are you gonna stay for dinner? I can't. Other places to be. I gotta go. Okay, well... Alright, see you later. I just really fucking need Lexi right now. Yeah, that's all you ever say. Yeah, I know but I just... It's fucking different this time, okay? It's always fucking different. It's all you ever say. You're fucking joking. I just need it, Lexi. I would like to help you but I need money. Don't buy it if you can't afford it. You're still owed me from last time. - I'll get you the money. - It's all you ever say. I should be getting something in the next few days. I'm not a charity. Just a five.. Please! It helps me relax with the kids and that. Spare me the fucking kids! It stresses me out when you tease them. It's getting really old! I've got ten, alright? Just give me something for that. Fuck sake! Buy your kids something to eat and keep that! Last fucking time! I can't do this again, alright? Last time! I hear you. Tell your kids I sad hello. You are an angel Lexi. I work hard. I am busy. This place costs money. You know what its costing? It's costing Eleanor a father. And you have the aldacity to turn up at my house. Spare me the high horse riching, Charles. Our mom has just died. And what about El? - Oh, you're gonna give me advise wether... - Yes, you're damn righ I am. - You can't just piss-off at me... - Get out of my house! - I will. - Get out! I don't want you here. And it's Eleanor not El. That's what her friends call her. What friends? Yeah, exactly! You would't know! Oh, is the money, isn't it? That's what it is. How much do you want? Go fuck yourself, Charles! Go fuck yourself, Charles! Do you want some company? What happened between you and dad? It's been going on for years, so... You probably wouldn't understand because you're an only child. What wouldn't I understand? Why is everyone think that? When we were children your father was always the golden boy. I guess we were always really different. But there was a time when we were really close. When he first met your mom. The three of us used to go everywhere together. I mean sometimes it was four if I had a boyfriend. I had quite a few boyfriends because I was really picky. I remember the person she brought out of him. Like she really opened him up, you know. And I really I loved that about him. He blames me. What for? Mom? I mean... I guess... It's kind of my fault in a weird way. The Mini. There was another reason I got rid of it. A long time ago one of the seat belts was broken. I had been meaning to get it fixed. I mean, I really had been meaning to get it fixed it for a long time. Anyway... Your mom and I wanted to go to see this concert and your dad wasn't up for it because he thought we were too old. He wanted to stay home with you. Listen to the radio. Anyway, so we were leaving and he comes out to see us off and he sees the seat belt is broken and he said no way is your mom getting in this death trap. Especially with me at wheel. So he hands you to your granny and he says he's gonna drive us. Later on when I woke up at the hospital they told me your mother was gone. They tried everything they could. And you know? For ages, all I could think about was the bloody seat belt. If I just fixed it then maybe... So that's why you got rid of the car? I'm sorry. Oh no. No, don't be sorry. None of this is your fault. None of it. Okay? And then shortly after your mother died then you had that accident and your father thought he was gonna lose you too. Here. I should probably go. No Lexi. Dad. You know I don't approve of this. Why not? Can't. You can't afford to waste it on me. I can't afford not to. You might need that for afterwards. So you are a doctor now, are you? Thank you. What's that woman been saying to you? That woman? Damn! What do you expect? It's older than me. - Hey, boy. - JJ, come here, boy. Hi. Does Alexia live here? Yes. Sometimes. She is not here at the moment, you know. I don't think she's gone far. Come in and wait if you want. They say people start to look like their dogs. Pardon? It is OK. If you can't laugh about it. I never knew these houses were here. Oh, shit! I built most of them. Not by myself, obviously. You are a builder? Was. Of course. I was a craftsman. That's a carpenter to you. Not someone who sells chips? No. But I do like to eat a lot of them. Steve! I left my fags in the bedroom. Can you get them, will ya? Right. It's alright, I'll get them. No, it's alright. Who is that? A mate of Lexi's. What she want? Nothing, she just come in to wait. Oh, let me do it, I'll get them. Alright. First on the left. Close to the table. Steve! You getting fags or what? You wanted these? Yeah. So, you must be Alexia's mother? Must I? Well, I figured... I saw the picture so.. So how do you two know each other? I can't see you going at the same school. No. We actually met about a week ago and Alexia.. So you do hang out with my little girl? I was just going to tell you that she called an ambulance for my grandmother. Right. We start to became friends... I'll tell you... I know your fucking time. You disgust me. Sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. Do you fancy her? What? Do you fancy her? I'm sorry but you don't know anything about me. Oh, I think I do love. You know nothing about me... I can say exactly who you are. I've met you coming. What are you saying? Doubt you'll be back anytime soon. I really don't want to cause any trouble. I just saw your husband outside and he said I could wait. Suit yourself, darling. Did she say when she would be back? I couldn't give a shit to tell you the truth. I keep telling you to have that fucking thing put down. You know, I'm just gonna go. If Lexi comes back, please just tell her to call. Bye. Fuck sake! That fucking dog. What? What are you looking at? How is your foot? Sorry? Your foot... is it all right? Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Phillip, love, let's go now! Who's that? Nobody, grand. Just somebody local. Lovely! Must have left it upstairs. I can wait. All right. Are you all right? Mamy's gonna make you something nice for tea? That's not your dinner, is it? Alexia! Alexia! Fuck! Hey? Alexia? Why are you following me? I thought you might like a drink. I stoled these for you. You what?! I stoled them for you. What the fuck! Why did you do that for? Do you think that's what I want? Because I don't, ok? I don't want any of this. Do you think...stealing is gonna make you better? You don't have to steal anything. You don't even fucking drink! What good is it gonna do? I'm sorry. I thought you'd like it. I wasn't thinking about me. Well...maybe you should. You have to look out for yourself, all right? The world is fucking shit. Well, you've already stolen them now. So we must just drink them. You're fucking mental, you are. Did you bring a cork screw? I know I left something around here. What are you doing? Oh, fuck yeah. All right! Let's get this fuck oppened, shall we? Couldn't you've got something with a screwtop? You have to twist and pull. Oh, yeah? You do it then. All right. Go on. Oh, fuck! Come here! Give me your hand! Are you all right? I didn't mean to do that. Jesus! I didn't mean to do that. Here, take this off. Put this on. I didn't mean to do that, all right? Are you okay? Are you all right? What are you doing? I'm sorry. Sorry? You apologize a lot, ok. I just... Just what? I... You know...I know. You know what? It's all right. I'm glad you finally said it. If you can call it that. That don't change anything. Sit down. See? You did it. Drink that. It will warm you up. Drink it. I'm gonna get you another shirt for you, all right? What? Please, don't leave me. It will just be a minute. You will be all right. I won't be long. Promise. Complete waste of space! You can't look after any of us. You can't even look after yourself. Call yourself a mother. You don't have a job! You sit in the house all day and do absolutely nothing! You haven't got a job! I'm trying! But what am I suppose to do? You tell me. I don't know. Do I ask for you to sort out? I'm fucking babysitting gain. It's embarrassing! I'm sick of it. Fucking move out of my way. No, we're gonna talk about this. What are you fucking doing here? Are you going somewhere? Go to bed, yeah? So you are finally leaving. Good! I'm glad. So am I. Lesbian. Slag. I love you, dad. I love you too, darling. Let your old dad be by himself, ok? Leave me alone. "Alexia, your dad owes me money. If I do not get them.." I thought you wouldn't coming back. Claro que voltaria. Come with me. Where? I wanna take you somewhere. Where are you taking me? Just stop here. Come on. I know this place. God, I haven't been here for years. Surprised it ain't not torn down. Built another stay on it. Hurry up! Get on! Get on! No, you do it. Drink some more. That's why you should be drinking more. Where are you going now? No way. Get in. Why are you so scared of water anyway? Because... I almost drowned as a child. Oh, shit! Really? Yes. Do you know I haven't really been in water since apart from... from earlier, obviously. I'm gonna help you with this. What? Your fear. We'll face it together, yeah? Come here. I can't. Yes, you can. Just put one foot in front of the other. You just have to trust me. Do you? Come on. Sit down. Look up the sky. Are you ready? I think so. My grand used to read this story for me. "The Water Babies". It was about this child who fell into the water and was transformed. And afterwards it could only make good for people. And she'd really sang it to me every night. And you know the night before she died she asked if she could read a little. And I said no. She looked so hurt. I shouldn't have said no. Anyone can hurt anyone. You better learn that. You never answered my question. Of course. You know where I live. Good... because I don't really have anyone else. Come here. Are you scared? No. Not anymore. Are you? No. I've never been afraid of the dark. Been afraid of the light though. What are you doing? Come here. You're so innocent, El. There's one more thing I wanna show you. I just need to get another key. What for? You'll see. Come on. That's my little dawn. No one knows about this place but me. Wow. It's pretty cool really. Yeah. This is what I think it is, right? You're sharp, aren't you? And you sell this? Well this batch ain't quite ready yet but it will be soon. And a couple more after that we are on the woods. What do you mean? My dad had a few money issues. He could barely walk after what happened. I'm so sorry. It happened at work and they were meant to give him a big pay out but they fuck him over. Shit! Yeah. So...is this all you sell? Where the hell have you been? I went out to get milk. Where is it? It worn out. Fuck, you scared me. Sorry. What are you doing here? I thought you might need some help. All right. You can keep a look out. Ok, I'll look in the back. Shut up! Ok, sorry. I think he's dead. We should call an ambulance. We shouldn't be here. Who do you think is this? I don't know. Come on! Look at all these stuff. It looks like as he never left the house. How do you live like that? It seems like such a waste. We really shouldn't get in here long. I'm gonna finish what we started. Let's go on the back. Don't forget me. He will be all right. You can go now. Right. Are you ain't really ready? I've made you some fresh coffee. That is just what I need. Mmm... So I speaked to my dad. About what? About your situation. Your father's situation. What about him? So, right, what do we know? He was refused compensation after the accident. On what grounds? Company policy. Well, that's not right. I know. Have a look into it. He's got a case? My dad thinks so, yeah. And he never lost a case. Really? No. "A late birthday present. I hope you can use with your friends." Nice bike. Thanks. It was my mom's. So... This is it. I guess so. This new house of yours it's not too far away, is it? It's far as I've ever been. It's better than anything I've ever had before. And it don't have stairs. My dad couldn't believe it. What was that? Just something I don't need anymore. You know how much you mean to me. I'll go soon. Well, there's just one thing I wanna do before you leave. Ok. Do you know what your problem is? What? You're too dry.
