Where did you want to go? Come back home. What's wrong with you? You don't have the keys anyway. Come on. You see, the door's locked. What's wrong? Have you got that women's thing? What's got into you? We'll move to another apartment and everything will be okay. The apartment isn't the only problem. Cast: Make-up: Marta Doktorova Costume Design: Zdenka Bocankova.

His brother opened the door. - And his parents? - I haven't seen them all day long. Wonderful mother! Let's take this off. What's your name? Won't you tell me? He's got a bruise on his back. I don't know what from. Don't you? I'll tell you. Your name's Martin, isn't it? Or Maros? Come on, sit up. We're almost done. Wait... We're almost done. Almost... Again? Your mother's in the bathroom. Is that the only one they had? I woke up twice, I couldn't fall asleep. I didn't sleep at all. My back aches. Here... Leave me alone. I want to sleep. Why did I get married? You go to work at night and in the morning... You don't even prepare breakfast for me. Where's my other sock? - Where's Sofa? - She's not been here. ...She was going to make me breakfast. - Ill do it. What was she doing there all night long that gets her so tired? What are you doing? There were stains here. You should be more careful. Do you want me to help you? My husband told me that his belly was growing. I told him mine was growing too. We laughed our heads off... Maros, say something. Was his mother here? She said he'd be better off in a children's home. I'd love to see her. And the guy she's living with. I asked her: "Why do you live with him if you don't love him?" - What did she say? - That she can put up with it. Another one deluding herself. Maybe she's afraid to be alone. - File it please. Yes. My legs hurt. I'm an old dame already. Toddlers' ward. Are you free? I'll send someone. Where are you going? We're going to take some pictures. Take me along, we'll make a family portrait. We don't want you there. America, Africa, pepper, salt and paprika... Do you want a ride? Come on. You even sleep here, you'd be of no use to us. Hang on! Haven't you got anything else to do? It doesn't seem to be working. Don't bang, we're repairing it! Do you want the ball? Take it. What's wrong with him? He doesn't want to talk. Don't be afraid. You're silent. I know why. We'll wait. - I'll walk, doctor. - But your heart is weak, granny. I don't need anything anymore. Where are you taking me? On our date. You're my son! - Good morning, girls... - Good morning. Vlado, where have you been so long? At my wedding. This is my bride. - And why not me? - He couldn't even lift you up. I've got another groom. Could you wash my hair? I'll come in the afternoon. Oh, Mrs. Malikova. Long time, no see. You're going to tell me off! You'd better reprimand your wife. Come on, Mrs. Malikova... What does he know about children. He can't even make his own. He'd do anything for it... Would you clean the floor in the kitchenette please? If it makes you happy... I dreamt of my husband. We met in a park. I asked him: “What's your name, sir?” I didn't recognise him. I can't stop thinking about it. My creams have gone - ...from the bathroom. - What creams? I found them in the waste bin. I thought you weren't using them any longer. He's not at home. I don't know. What did he promise you? Call later. Once again he's started a job and never finished it. He's very busy. Everyone needs him. Did he get this from the doctor? He was such a good child. We used to tell each other everything. He got a headache so many times, and shortly afterwards I had it too. Are you starting again? Why are you making empty promises? The ad failed. Mum doesn't want to live in a block of flats. What's so funny? You decide that too? You can't even cook. Something's missing. Salt, probably. Will you arrange it? For the doctor. All of the plumbing has to be replaced. It's all rotten. And we don't take orders from private persons. It won't be for free. Why are you gaping at me? I'll make money, right? Sometimes you look at me the way your mother does. Have you got a headache? Because all of a sudden, I do. You don't like anything I do. Everything I do is wrong. No, that's bad! It's no use. We're training all the time, but getting nowhere. That's very bad. Be careful. There's no point in doing it like that. But I did it the same way. The same way... that's not it! So, one more time and be careful. You see? Now it was good. Sona! I've got him! The guy in the Philippines. Now I've lost him. The conditions are good today. I must get in touch with him. What do you know about him? - I'll get a confirmation of connection. - So what? Talk to me. - We should meet other people. - I already know enough people. Well, it's better. Let him breathe a bit longer. He'll be okay in a few days. - I'd keep him right away. - And your husband? He doesn't want children. They're putting him in a children's home anyway. I went out with that teacher yesterday. He made me jog around the park at eleven p.m. - Give it me. - You can talk? What else will you tell me? We are going to breathe now. Show me how you can breathe. And now with this, okay? Show me... yes, that's it. They don't have any lime. - And what's that? - They said it's sold out. - And firebricks? - By the end of the month. Wait for me here, I'll be right back. Pick up the bricks in the afternoon. I hope you'll manage to get a taxi even without me. - And you? - I'm off on a business trip. Will you miss me? I might call you. And what about the plumbing? I gave a demijohn of wine to a nurse. Her husband will take care of it. See? Is the piano still here? They didn't want to take it. There's no one to repair it. You've got to find someone. I should be studying for the examination but I'm carrying lime instead. It hasn't been settled yet. - We'll need the piano. - At your service. Sofia! Please do the sedimentation for me, I'm starving. Get me something too. I don't have time for anything. I get in from my shift, lie down... Even the lab technician wakes me up to say someone's stolen her ham from the fridge. Can't you see I'm taking my clothes off? Why are you always creeping in? I seek the warmth of good people, said Prince Myshkin. - Here, it's repaired. - Thanks. You burst in here all the time... Do you think I've never seen a woman without her clothes on? Are you nervous? He used to drive an ambulance, someone jumped under his wheels. I've had enough since this morning. Molnarova hasn't come to work. Sona, could you do the night shift? I need to study, I've got school tomorrow morning. Someone wants to be smarter than the rest of us. Do you want to leave us? Your mother-in-law was here. She asked us to give you a transfer. You shouldn't do night shifts if they exhaust you so much. Hold on. Just a moment, don't be scared. Open up, that's it... Open up one more time! You see, it'll be alright. It's okay now. Don't cry. Don't cry, you're a big girl. Why aren't you asleep? Lie down... Zuzka, go to sleep. Hide that leg, will you? Maros, let's go for a walk, shall we? The doctor said it's OK. Here's your coffee. I knocked. The airs stale in here. That was an anonymous letter. Some “kind soul” wrote to say my wife goes on business trips pretty often. Hasn't your husband forgotten me? Don't worry. I'm glad you're on duty with me. Leave it. Are you just as obedient when you're at home too? There's no one to obey. She should do what she wants. I don't care anymore. She may have her reasons too. Sometimes a woman thinks that only ten percent of her capacity is used. Is that true in your case? A woman's gone missing. She left her home for no reason whatsoever, and she didn't leave a message. She's 170 cm tall, wearing a grey skirt and a black moustache... no, boots. Is there a picture of her? For no reason whatsoever... Help us find her. I'm off at the double. Have you given out antibiotics? If need be, call me. - Won't you have a coffee? - I like it best at home. ...Maros went to the fair and bought what? — A rooster. - Yes. And what does the rooster do? - Cock-a-doodle-do. - One more time... - Cock-a-doodle-do... Come down now. ...And what else did he buy? - A car. Oh, no! Go. Marosko! Peekaboo! What else could he have bought? Let me show you. Cluck, cluck, cluck... Are you a hen? I don't know. I guess so. I've got something for you. Shall we have some chocolate? Let's open it... You're out of your mind! You cart someone else's pram around, making me look like a fool! Give it to me! Let go! I'll carry it! I don't get you. I don't know what's going on in your head. Not everybody's as perfect as you are. Is that why you look after a kid abandoned by his mother? You're not a kid, are you? Cut it out or I'll beat you to pulp! Did you pick my shirts up from the cleaner's? They're in the closet. Tell that doctor of yours... Mine? You're the one he needs. Tell him it's gonna be eighteen, not twelve thousand. A doctor, and he's so small when he needs something. Jesus! There's water everywhere! Sofia! Come here! You were in the bathroom. I was. You too. Someone's removed the hose from the bathtub. Who's in the bathroom all day long - you or me? Nobody would do that on purpose! It wasn't me. Give me that cloth! Don't come in here! There are three of us here. So, who did it? Someone must have done it. I don't know what to do. But it's so easy. Why should a woman give up so much? And why should she forego her needs? Just to admire and serve someone? I guess it's what suits them. We love to make sacrifices... And when it blows up, we discover that we've lost ourselves. A woman always has to be stronger than a man. - Mum, when are you coming? - Please put her to bed. Not yet... My face... that can't be true... My body's lying too. Who gave me this face? When I was little, I only wanted to live up to the age of thirty. I didn't want to get old. You are old? I used to have a silent joy... deep inside. It always overwhelmed me all of a sudden. I'd be walking down the street and suddenly... - Ouch! - Katka! Come to bed. What is silent joy? Sofa, where have you been? It's half past ten. - I already told you. - You've woken mother up. Then send her to check up on me in the hospital. Sofa, open the door! - Let me see... - What do you want? Leave me alone! I thought I saw a red spot there. Hello... Do you have a moment? I need to talk to somebody. This is Sofa. I'm glad you're calling. Is something wrong? No. Time's up, folks! I used to run away from home. I thought getting married would make me independent. Good idea. - And now? - What? - Why are you sitting here with me? - Because I'm barking mad. My husband said he would arrange it. - He wants another six thousand. - Okay. Quid pro quo. I'm barking mad too. I fell out of the window when I was four and banged my head. We have that in common. But you like your coffee best at home, right? We're closing, folks! It should be somewhere here. Sorry. Why did you say that we'd made love for a rainy day? - Because it's never going to happen again. - What? Would you be ready to alter anything in your life for me? To give something up or destroy it? No. That's why I said it. You might be knocking on the wrong door. Have a cup of tea. And what should I change? My name, job, wife? Or I could change myself if you wish. Sometimes I think that I don't need anyone anymore. I'm not sure if I'm still able to feel anything. Thank you for being honest with me. I called you to get strength to leave my husband. Do you want some sugar? I don't take sugar. OK 3 CMB... OK 3, Cyril, Maria, Bozena... OK 3, CMB... OK 3, Cyril, Maria, Bozena... I think I've got water on the knee. What should I do with it? Don't you care at all? I should never have married you! I hate that hospital, even from the outside. Does he have a hairy chest? - Who? - Your husband. - When did you last have sex? - About three months ago. I wouldn't be able to cope with that. When such a hairy guy cuddles up to you... You must be a scorpio. We've been busy this morning. An old woman died. I don't know how about you but I see such things at work... I need to have some fun. Shit, I've a ladder in my stocking again. That sucks. What now? Do you have a spare pair of stockings? I'll take them off soon anyway. - So what? I'll get fat, marry... - Take my measurements. Fifty-six. Do you know why they say I'm a scorpio? Because I like doing it. Forty-three. What's it going to be? I don't know yet. You think a lot. In the end, they always make the decisions for you. You've been here for two weeks and what have you come up with? I'll arrange my life the way I wish. Will you be here tonight? I'm standing in for Zdena. That suits me. Marosko... Here you are. What's this? When's he going to be transferred? Do you want to keep him? You wouldn't get him. Why not? Well, for instance because you don't sleep at home. Your mother-in-law was here again. Have you noticed? The doctor's pretty cheerful today. He must have had a hot night with his wife. It's a critical congenital heart defect. The main artery protrudes over the damaged partition and pumps blood from both ventricles. So, the used blood gets into the major circulation, causing the blue colour of the skin and mucous membranes in the whole body. Sofia... Mother agreed to move to her sister's. But they don't speak to each other. You should go back home. Let's go outside. Do you want me to adopt that brat or what? No. You bitch. You keep saying 'me” Proudly tossing your head. You keep saying me, me, me... - One ticket please. - On your own? I said to him: “You'd have to change your ways.” - What did he say? - As ever, that I don't understand. Who lives here? A little girl. - What's her name? - I don't know. Shaggy-haired Katka, disobedient. - Absolutely not. She's been shopping. - And she's going to cook dinner. Catch me! Hi! Good that you're here. I've got a flat tyre and the spare's flat too. Gosh... Don't get in, Katka! - Do you need help? - No, thanks. We've bought a fish. Who's going to kill it? Not me. You look good. - I'm sleeping well too. - That's great. - When I feel like it I stay longer in bed... - Who with? Have you seen the guy that you jog with in the park? He had a class. I was behind the fence, he was blowing the whistle, and thirty girls were running around him. Katka, come here! Have you worked it out? No, I left. So, who's going to kill the fish? Who do you think... I'm more of a man than a woman already. Everything's the other way round. I don't know why. Where's Maros? His mother came. Doctor Macko talked to her for two hours. She took him home, said she would keep him. What do you think of it? Oli, oli, little Johnny, Kneel down on your knees... Do you think you did the right thing for Maros? Could you do something for me too? I don't think so. We were together and we pretend that nothing's happened. Can't we change it? - I'm a bit scared now. - Why? Because I need you. To arrange something again? Worse. I'm also scared of getting involved in something and not knowing how to get out. People should get rid of everything keeping them down. But how? Have you chosen? Just a moment, please. Don't be mad. - I've been waiting at the bus stop. - I had to arrange something. - What did you tell your wife? - Whatever. Don't spoil it now. - What's going on? - You're snoring. There's nothing I can do about it. You woke me up. You're lying on your back. Lie on your side. I never lie on my back. I don't want to love you. My mother used to slave around my father. He always had to look absolutely ship-shape. And he chased after other women. I don't want to be like her. Do you respect me as a human being? She says she can't have children with me. She hounds me around all the medical tests. But she's the one with the problem. She thinks she keeps me in check. What are you afraid of? It's not so easy to leave someone just like that, is it? Why not? You just leave as if you'd gone shopping. Am I being mean? How many people must you hurt just to be yourself? I like you the way you are. Really? - Hello? - Is doctor Macko there? Doctor, it's for you. Yes. - Why didn't you come? I'll explain it to you later. I can't be always waiting for you. I know, we have to be careful. I can't talk to someone without seeing his face. Sorry, but I have to go. Where are you calling from? - That's a surprise. - Come on... What are you doing here? We can't hold hands here. That's not the reason I came. Sona, all this pretending... is killing me too. Having to smile, say things that... No one can take away my knowledge. I love my job and I want to achieve something on my own. Then go for it. I don't want anything from you. I just want you to be happy. I'm probably getting old. I've lost the drive. That's not true. She thinks that I'm lost without her. That I won't even pass the specialty certificate examination. She knows how to pull strings, that's why I act as her sidekick. But why? I chase people up to work on my father-in-law's house, I chase material... That house isn't yours? I'm in debt. I've got money in it. Yesterday an old lady told my future from coffee grounds. She said I'll have two children and loads of money. Now you've got two loads of diapers instead. Better than nothing. I couldn't manage it alone. Not angry with me anymore? Why are you doing... the things you're doing? Because I'm looking for something. What do you need? I'll arrange it. A friend of mine makes lists of everything that people need. We're sitting on a bench, people passing by and she says: 20 ladies' coats, 10 school bags... And I write it down. What? I need someone who can repair a piano. No problem. I thought you wanted more than that. No, no. I'm out of practice. But Mr. Benko, you said you've got nothing to do. You're the best. You think so? I've repaired all sorts of things. They're here. Are you still seeing that student? She could come and sweep our floor. Wait upstairs, I left the door open. I've never heard of anyone taking the piano to the repairman. Tuners are hard to find. - Lift it a bit higher. - Just a bit. My wife wants to give it to somebody. I'd quietly throw it away. I thought it was for Sofa. Good afternoon. Are you the doctor's wife? Let's have a break. Once again, for someone who knows someone? What's your problem? Sometimes I have a feeling that this is about someone else. This really isn't me, this is someone else. Are you insane? Do you want me to be sorry for you for doing what you don't want to do? Nothing is for free. Come on! What if I pressed this button and you'd suddenly be twelve years younger? I wish I were single and had a child with you. I didn't say what I felt for too long. Then it seemed to me that I didn't feel anything at all. Look! But it's changed with you. What else has changed? I've got to go back. You've got hands like my father. I loved him very much and then... The windows are open. Who are you looking for? We thought... Helena gave us the keys. We're colleagues. Co off and play! We should also have called the doctor. Was he here? You've just missed him. Don't complicate it. - Go to the foreman and tell him you'll pay him. - No. But then, don't be surprised. You can calmly move into the cottage. Okay. How much do you want? I have other duties too. Those two buckets won't kill you. You need a new wife but who would want you? Do you have the recipe? I mean for the sausages. Have the mushrooms too. There are rumours spreading about... you should be more careful. Do you want to play second fiddle here until you retire? Great... I talked to the mason, I want to take some cement. Will you help me? I'm repairing an inner tube, the driver had to leave. I've got a bottle of good wine. Come on... Where are you taking it? My wife needs it for wall tiles. We've got the workers waiting. Oh... Doctor, I need Brufen. Two boxes. Drop by later. Has somebody taken some sand? Someone's always taking the sand. Wait here. I really wanted to see you. - I'm sorry. - I am Mackova. I wanted to warn you not to get your hopes up. You've no idea yet how it feels to be useless. Like a piece of crumpled paper. Do you think he's ever read any of my articles? And what do you write about? You've got to make money somehow. - The same, Jarka! - Not for me. Do you like your job? I can't imagine doing anything else. If you wanted to get a transfer, I can arrange it. I'm having his child. How clever you are. How long do you want to wait? Ten years? Then he'll divorce and marry someone else. You'll laugh at me... but I want to help him. I can't listen to this. Nowadays, it's impossible to meet a decent guy. First help yourself, then the others. What have you got against him? He made a good marriage. He knows what's best for him. He won't be a junior doctor for long. Let's eat. Maybe that's not all he wants. I think he resembles your husband in some way. - There are moths here. - Excuse me? I said there are moths here. No way. Have you come back? What do you want? Have you changed the lock? I've come for my stuff. Have you made your mind up? If you wish we could have a child. Maybe I won't sign the papers. I gave you two thousand for the machine. - What do you mean? - We'll split everything up. When you came you had nothing. Sofia! I dreamt of my husband again. He pointed to your room and asked: "Are they at home?" We'll get rid of the furniture, there'll be more space here. Tidying up won't change anything. I keep dreaming of going somewhere, but I can't get there. Is lunch ready? We're having sirloin of beef. Will you have some? - You're making problems, Sofia. - What problems? Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. Does it concern my work? Do you think that if you work in a hospital you have to bag a doctor? You didn't manage to bag one? We don't need such nurses here. If you don't get your personal life in order... - What do you know about it? - You'd be surprised. - Well? - He sent me to the head physician. But I've already spoken to him. He agrees with the chief nurse. I do want to work here. And I want the specialty certificate. I asked him why they'd chosen Macko and not me. He said: “You're an emancipated woman but...” I wanted to punch his face. We're only emancipated when it comes to work. Are you going to the cafeteria? I'm not going to wait for miracles, that maybe... later... one day... My career is vital to me. Whether I divorce or not... Is that why I have to leave? It would probably be better... for some time. - So you're not happy. - I am. You don't even know how much it means to me. I'll find you a small apartment and I'll visit you there. Twice a week. I'd feel like a kept woman. Sona... I'll take care of you both. When a doctor hasn't achieved anything by the age of forty... I need my family background. You said something else before. I'd rather be a realistic cynic than an unrealistic dreamer. Sofia! I also wanted to tell you... I had a cold. I invented the baby. You mean you lied to me? I don't get it. What do you actually want? Now I know what I don't want. Get out! That's all I needed! Hey, you, can't you drive? Well? - Note down my licence plate and piss off! - Who do you think you're talking to? - Mr. Marek, I'm going to wash you. Yes? Nurse! I always think of you when I fall asleep. - I know you're getting a divorce. - So what? I'm going to be discharged on Friday. How about we go on a date? Take a cold shower. Am I a maid of all work or what? What's wrong? You also have to joke with them. I don't think it's dripping, nurse. It has to drip ever so slowly, Mr. Benko. How will I go to the toilet? You need to go now? I'll bring you a bedpan. Sona? Could you come later? Does she have someone in there again? Zdena is on maternity leave. We'll have to fill in for her. Do you want to dye something? Take off your trench coat. You should get out a bit. Don't lie here or I'll splash you with water. I bought you a ticket to the movies. I see... that's the reason why. Not the only one. How long have you been lying here? You're a great girl, do you know? But I wouldn't keep the baby. A kid without a father... that sucks. Push that lever by the door! - Hit. - Everything I touch I destroy. Let me help you. There must be something wrong with me. That's not true. Perhaps I really should just look after myself. Take advantage of whatever I can. Don't get discouraged. I even quit school... You'll start again. Are you really so good or are you just pretending? Nurse, could I get a sleeping pill? When I used to drive an ambulance, a woman ran in front of the car. I managed to brake. She stood there, staring at me... She was in a state of shack. I couldn't give her any help before we got to the hospital. Now you would be able. - Did you check on Mr. Benko? - He's asleep. Wait. I always wanted a brother. You're like my brother. Are you okay? You could have gone to bed. Us young girls can't be picky. If we don't catch a husband at school, we have to take whatever's available. Was she a good girl? A week ago she wanted to give me her savings so I could get married. I proposed to him. What do you think? My legs ache so much. - Marriage is the best career. - I don't think so. Some women would surely be happier if they could live alone, but they want to own someone to prove they're not worthless. I don't want to own anybody. It's not easy to be independent. Just be glad you don't have children. Is someone playing a piano? I don't think so. I've tuned all sorts of pianos. Well, Mr. Benko, how's your breathing? Everything will be alright. He doesn't look well. - He couldn't breathe in the morning either. - Stay with him. - Do you want some oxygen? - They're playing again. Can you hear it? Buy some sugar. There's none at home. What a mad idea! At two am. She failed an exam. She was afraid to go home. So she'll repeat the whole year and find another boyfriend. Come to the wash basin. - How many pills have you taken? - Sit down. - Open your mouth. - Swallow it. Swallow it! Quick! Come with me. I know how you feel. Don't you ever do it again, right? You have to love yourself. And you have to respect yourself. Do you know how many nice things are ahead for you? Good morning. - Is Sofia here? - She was a minute ago. I'll have a look. She doesn't want to see you. I brought her some of her stuff. And I'll take this machine. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Are you going to sew a petticoat? Mind your own business! What's up? Who's that? He took our sewing machine! Call the porter! You know what? She can keep it! Piss off! Tailor! - I'm not going to scramble with you... - Get out, you jerk. I've got a friend here. Come with me. This is Sofa. What do you need? I'm Piroska, I can arrange everything. We'll make a list. What do you want? I've got everything. I can give you a golden cat. From Egypt. What about a salad recipe? But it's in Hungarian. And what will I give you? All the best things are free. - I can't see. - Hang on. There's nothing in here. The owner's family pillaged everything. Cold... Warmer... Warm... Warm... Hot. The plates are here, the pots down there. The fridge works. Why are you doing it? We're just friends. Isn't that enough? Vlado, I've changed. I've always tried to adapt to someone. But then I was unhappy with myself. And when I didn't like it somewhere, I ran away. Then stop running. What's wrong with this key? We'll tune it. Will you be my housemate? But I want to be alone now. Produced by: Executive Producer: Jan Tomaskovic. Director of Photography: Viktor Svoboda. Directed by. DUSAN HANA English subtitles by: I.
