Hey there, Kevin. You're over awfully early today. What? Kevin. Kevin, what have you done to my child? What have you done? - Yo. You're still down to jam, right? - Yeah, I'm still fucking down, man, but I've been sitting in a parking lot for 45 fucking minutes. Just tell me where I'm going. Just know that it was all for you. Every last drop. - I have no idea what that means. Kevin? I need the fucking address! Fuck. - Hello? Chloe, what are you up to tonight? - I'm sorry, who's this? Of course, sorry, it's Kevin, you know, with the goods. - Oh! Oh, my God, I'm sorry, I thought I had your number saved for sure. It's all right. I mean, 'tis the life of a dealer, I suppose. - I didn't mean it like that. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, really. But in all seriousness, kinda actually why I'm calling. You see I'm friends with this guy that lives out west who happens to be visiting some family in town. Point is, he shipped an ounce of OG haze here to try and flip while he's around. Didn't work out so well for him and now he needs to get rid of it before his flight out in the morning and he's looking to me to cover it but I told him I could probably do only like half the weight so I thought I'd hit you up, see if you could cover the other half it's like 350 all together. Pretty good deal, right? - Yeah, it sounds like a great deal, but I don't know, I can't just lay down all that money at one time and I work tomorrow and it's already getting kinda late. It's never too late for a deal. - Maybe like in a week I could hit you up for a gram or two? Look, just hear me out. So you're spending 350 on three quarters, now that breaks down into six eighths, which you could easily flip for like 50, maybe 55 bucks a pop if you find a couple suckers. Yeah, actually I'll tell you what, I'll go ahead and cover another eighth so that way you're only paying like 315. - Don't you have friends for this sort of thing that do this? You're saying we're not friends? - No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying like friends that do this sort of thing more often. Look, you buy weed often from me often enough, so I thought maybe you'd like to get in on a little deal. This guy is trying to move fast and I need someone I can trust. How do we do this? Is my place all right? I mean, West Coast homie is nearby, no chit chat, in and out, I promise. Okay, well, then will you text me your address? Absolutely. Yeah, I'll see you soon. National weather service in Northern Indiana has issued a tornado warning for northern Adams County, Indiana-- Feel like I'm here, not just like I'm observing, but I'm actually here and I'm better. Kinda want to-- Blah blah blah blah. Shut the fuck up. Did you even consider being a satanist? Well, I try to be, this is what's ridiculous. As a child as a 13, 14-year-old I said the Lord's Prayer back with black candles but at that point I was-- Official level of what was essentially a major ration of Christianity and I looked deeper and further into what other options there were and I discovered Wicca and Paganism because in the Northern European sense of the word it was like Wicca and paganism is pre-Christian. And once you quit whining long enough for me to get a word in edge wise, I said, listen up. Your hubby was over 100 pounds overweight. He smoked three packs of cigarettes a day. God did the killing, he killed himself. Oh, my God, who put you on the air? What the fuck is this shit? Every night, the same shit. Nonsense. Fucking garbage. Quit whining about the will of God. It wasn't God's will, it was his. Your destination is ahead on the left. - Jesus Christ. What the fuck? Hello? Jesus fucking Christ. Anybody here, here, here, here? Pretty good cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese. Fuck! Oh, shit! - The fuck? - I am so sorry. No one was answering the door so I came around. - Fuck. Hang on. Fuck, just... Hey. - Hey. I'm so sorry about that. I'm Chloe, I'm Kevin's friend. - Stu, also Kevin's friend. - Nice to meet you. Shoot, let me get that. I hear you live out west. - What? - Well, Kevin said you were visiting family or something? Ah, found it. Yeah, I only went out there once on a family vacation, big whoop, but I spent every day at the beach. I was obsessed, I couldn't get enough of it, it was heaven on earth. - Wait, where's Kevin? - He isn't here? - No. - You are the guy selling us weed, right? - What? - I'm sorry, I thought I was supposed to meet Kevin and this guy here. I thought. - No, I'm just here for band practice. Fuck. Hey, Kevin. I'm here with, what's your name again? - Chloe. - Chloe, right. And we're just wondering where the hell you're at, man. So, look, just give me a call back and let me know what's going on, all right? All right. I'm just gonna give him a minute. He'll probably call right back. - So you guys are in a band together? Mm-hmm. - And this is here you jam? - Yeah. Yeah, this is where we jam. - Is Kevin rich? - What? Fuck no. Oh. Right. Yeah, his parents are well off. - What do they do? - I don't know. - Well, I'm gonna get going. I don't know what's going on, so. Hello, I said I'm leaving. - Look I'm sure he's gonna be here any minute, but if you wanna go. - Will you let him know I stopped by. - Yeah, okay, sure. Just, yeah, all right. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice, pleasure. - Is this guy serious? Hey, where are you? I am so sorry. Just heard Stu's voicemail, totally forgot he was stopping by tonight. But, listen, West Coast homie is still on his way and I promise to be there in 15 minutes. Just had to hit up another spot on my way through town and then of course I'm stuck on a train, and this fog. - Hey, hey! Where the fuck are you, man? I'm running a little behind, okay? I just needed to take care of a few logistics. Give me another 20 minutes. - 20 minutes? Kev, that chick, Chloe, she's already come and gone, so what do you wanna do now? Chloe knows how to hang, she'll stick around, trust me. - No, but I don't want her to fucking stick around, Kev, if you're not here, that's the whole... This isn't what we fucking talked about, man. Listen, I left her a fat stack in a dish by the china cabinet, hand that off, grab a beer, and relax. - I already grabbed a beer. I'm fucking relaxed, man. Then kick back and let the good times roll. Here we go. - What? - Hey. Fuck! - I'm sorry, that's the last time. Was that him on the phone? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he told me 20 minutes. - Interesting, because he told me 15 minutes. - So half an hour? - Dealer time. - So are you gonna stick around then? - Well, I'm already here, aren't I? - He said he left something for you in the china cabinet. Ah, I bet, you know what? - Oh. - Ta-da. - Kevin, he shouldn't have. He shouldn't have, Jesus. - It's that good, huh? - It's that bad. - You know what, actually it might be ashes, this could be like some kind of urn. So, yeah, have fun with that and so there's a lot of cheese. - I saw the cheese, yeah. - And crackers. I'm gonna have a cigarette. - Yeah. Can I join you? - Sure, yeah. - Kinda spooky out here. - Yeah. It's atmospheric. - Do you live around here? - No. - Hey, listen, you look uncomfortable. I can go wait somewhere else, that's fine. - No, no, I'm... It's fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. - Okay. Do you smoke? - No. No, that shit makes me anxious. I used to smoke. Used to smoke a lot. It started to turn on me one day, you know? I feel like if you're a happy person, an optimistic person, then it tends to make you happier and more optimistic, but if you got a lot of dark shit floating around up there, well, it makes it a little darker. - So you don't want this? - No, fuck, God, no, thank you. Thank you, though. - So tell me about your band. - I write the lyrics and record the vocals and then I do some of the cover art, and Kevin, he plays guitar and he does samples, and then he programs the drums. - He programs the drums? - Yeah, on the computer. - So there's no drummer? - No, no, no, no drummer. Just one more person to fucking flake out. - And what's the name of this band? - Morbid Annihilator. Morbid Annihilator? - It was a compromise. - So given that name, is it metal, is it thrash metal, or death metal? Like the high-pitched screaming or the like low Cookie Monster growl? - What is it with the fucking Cookie Monster thing anyway? You're not the first person to say that. Of all the sounds that you could compare a metal scream to, everybody fucking says this dumb kids' character. I don't get it. - I like Cookie Monster, I was just... So what is that anyways, is it your diary? - No, it's not. No, it's not a diary. - Well, then what is it? - It's drawings, lyrics. - Can I hear a song? - You know, we're still working on some new stuff so. So show me something old. - Shit. - That was interesting. - You hate it. - I definitely don't hate it, it's just-- - It's okay if you hate it, most people hate it. - It's unique. - Good save. - So what's the goal, do you wanna be a professional? Is there a professional? - Yeah, kinda. I guess, I don't know, it's stupid. - Just tell me. - Look, the only thing that you need to know about the underground metal scene is that it is full of a bunch of pseudo-subversive crust punks who don't have a speck of dirt under their fingernails or an original thought in their stupid fucking skin heads, and they sit around on the Internet all day trying to get somebody to say something about them 'cause they have nothing to say about themselves. - Yeah, I know the type. - It's just exhausting trying to keep up with that shit because it has nothing to do with music. It's like nothing is sacred anymore. You know? It's like there's no real freaks. Sure, there are guys who'll stand up on stage and wring out a dead kitten like a dish rag. But there used to be guys who would do that when nobody was watching, just to see what comes out what end. I just mean that metal used to be intimidating. Used to be dangerous. Now it's just easy. But it's not like we're helping. We're not pushing the boundaries of the genre, we're just adding to the noise. - Well, to be fair. - Very funny, look, I just mean I wanna feel something real. Fucking real, like real. Something new, something different, something dangerous. I want it to feel like the music is standing over you 'cause it just knocked you on the fucking floor. - I get what you're saying. - I don't know. - I wanna accomplish things, as well. I want to go out into the world. I don't wanna be stuck here living and dying on minimum wage, and I want to be a part of something huge. I wanna be a part of it, I want to smell different places and see different things and-- I want to get out there, there's so much and... I want to study the ocean. - Come check it out. - Okay, that's kinda groovy. But something I can tap my foot to, what about that? - Oh, you can tap your foot to a blast beat, you just gotta do it really fucking fast. - I mean something I can dance to, something I can dance, you know? Do you not dance? - No, I'd rather die in a fucking house fire. - That's dramatic. Dancing is therapeutic, it's awesome. Get out there and move your body, just not care. - You should try a mosh pit then. - I've been in a mosh pit before, okay. Does this thing have Wi-Fi? - Yeah, of course it has WiFi. - Okay. - It's a computer. - Well, I don't know. - But, but, don't-- - I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, come on now, okay. ¶ I told you ¶ I told you ¶ I told you ¶ I told you ¶ I told you, I told you Sorry, I don't know why I thought you would like that. Sorry. - Does that make you mad? Does it make you mad that I won't dance with you? - What are we doing? - I'm gonna make you scream. - Oh? - Not like that. Not in a bad way, I'm talking about like a real primal, metal scream, like a deep-throaty howl. - Okay, so wait, let me get this straight. You absolutely refuse to dance with me, would rather die, and I'm supposed to follow your lead? - Well, you did, didn't you? You're out here. Look, you talk about therapy, okay? This is therapeutic, all right? Okay, so screaming into the trees is therapeutic? - Right, yeah, exactly. I genuinely believe people should scream more. You want me to show you how it is, okay, first off cigarette. - Okay. - Key element-- - Yes. - To the metal scream you probably should do it for about 10 or 15 years but that's okay. - Well, I got time, okay. Second is the stance. You gotta get a power stance like so. - Okay. - All right? - All right. - You ready? - Yes. What the fuck? No, hold on, that doesn't count, you totally fucked me up. - I'm sorry, it's really funny. - Listen, all right. - Okay, okay, okay, serious. - Do this for real. - Serious, no laughing. - For real this time. - Okay, go. - Here we go. - Ready. - I think I heard a crack in that one. - All right, you know there's like reverb and distortion, it's a huge part of the process. It's very complicated. - You think you can do better, I'd like to hear it. Jesus Christ, another one? - Shut it, Dad, I'm getting into my metal zone. Duh. Okay, so smoke. - Smoke. - Smoke. - Yup. - Stance. - Right. - Well, Christ, you gotta commit. If you're not gonna take it seriously I don't know what the fuck we're doing out here. - Sorry, it tickles my throat, okay. - Oh, okay. - Okay, okay, how do I do it then, other than stance and smoke? - You really wanna know? - Yes, yes. - All right, listen. First. I know it seems gross, but you gotta clear out that mucus. All right, and then big deep breath, you're good, big deep breath through your nose. And then you're just gonna push all of that air out from the back of your throat right out through your lips, okay? - Okay. - Focus up. Let's hear. - Okay. - Shit. That wasn't half bad. - Really? - Yeah, not too bad at all. Not too bad. - May I? Cigarette. Yeah? Do you want me to throw you through a fucking window? - Okay, okay, I know, I know, but one hit and one dance, and then we're even. - And a dance? - I screamed for you twice, I think that's worth one dance. Come on. - All right, we'll start with the hit. - Okay. - See where it goes. - Aw. Okay, okay. Sh, sh, sh, sh. - What? - Sh. I'm kidding, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - That's not fucking cool, don't do that. - I couldn't help myself. - Take this fucking thing. - Okay, okay, here trade, cigarette? How about I'll go get you a beer and then maybe I'll have a beer too, maybe. Who knows? - Yeah, okay. - Okay. - Oh God. Jesus fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. - Cheers. Yeah. Cheers. That was shitty weed, huh? - You're high. - Jesus Christ. Oh, huh. Ooh. - You okay? - I don't, have you seen my... My pencil... My pencil and my fucking notebook? I just had the fucking things. Fuck, fuck, fuck it. Fuck! Kevin? I need you to understand. It just happened so fast. Every single one of them. It's not what you think. It's what you need. - Kevin, when are you gonna get here, man? I'm freaking out, okay, I don't wanna do this shit anymore. I gotta get the fuck outta here. Baptized in chlorine. The removal of old blood. A family afloat. - What are you talking about? You in the pool? Stu. I'm drowning. - Oh, fuck, what the... What the? - What are you doing? - Oh, Jesus! Oh, fuck! Oh, shit. Oh my God, he's fucking lost it. He's fucking lost it. I didn't do it. Chloe, I didn't do this. - Trapped and burned four heads and severed family. - Hold on, hold on. - The perfect family. Perfect stage, their blood shall satisfy this white hot rage and take pleasure in knowing the shapes of their bodies. - He's coming. Get me up. - Flesh drudged across a rain of dust. Cracking under pressure, annihilation is a must. They say lightning never strikes the same place twice, but tonight it struck four. A thunderous roar across the fields urging, begging that I kill more. Who will be the first to go? Father soon to disguised. Mother cooking sweets and treats, time to kill another. I have to call someone. - No, Chloe, Chloe, no, wait. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay. But listen, listen, listen, you gotta think for a second, okay? We can't call anybody because this doesn't look good for any of us. - Stu. Chloe. See you've already met the heads of the house. - You stupid fuck! - It wasn't easy. But now it's dangerous. - You mother fucker! This is dangerous. Fucking... - You don't think this makes her your first? - Fuck. Jacket pocket. Getting the fuck out of here. Oh, fuck that. Hey, please. Please help me. Oh, fuck. - Chloe, please. Just get in the car. - Get the fuck away from me, holy shit. - No, no, look, listen, okay, that wasn't me. And I can explain but you just gotta trust me. - Trust you? You lied to me, you lied to me! And that wasn't his house, you killed those people. No, no, look, look, it wasn't supposed to go down like that. - And you wrote a song about it? - This is just a big misunderstanding, all right, but... Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Look, Chloe, that's him, all right? And if he gets us, he's gonna fucking kill us both. You just gotta get in the car. Help! - He's gonna kill us both, Chloe, come on! You gotta get in this car now! Come on! Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry. Banished from the warm soft place. Introduced to surgical steel. Frail, impressionable. He showed me to my master, commander and captor a mother glowing for the first time Yet my eyes, they knew true love blades so perfectly sharpened upon the table Shaped by a wonderful light. Manufactured Designed with integrity Was it wrong to be aroused at such a young age? Those shining instruments that bore me cut me, and calling my name, Cesarean, Cesarean. A section in time. His latex grip made quite an impression one that inspired me for years to come. An artist aware of their true form has the most to give. A unique energy, a presence. Vibrant and violent. As old as water and stone Yet they give names to their creations, disguise them as objects, displayed in corners where dust dwells heir intentions are to conceal. Bind the human spirit to the common thread. However, I take no solace in disguises No statements, no meanings. A point of view oh so sharp it's sure to cut through time and space. Open now, your eyes and heart, my experience destroys the human race. - We're Morbid Annihilator. And you're not making it out of here alive - This, Kevin, what the fuck is this, man? - This is something real. And it's ours. - No, listen to me, okay? We gotta go down there and we've gotta untie her and we gotta talk this shit out, okay, the three of us. Right now. - Oh, Stu. I think we might be past the point of conversation. - Look at what you've done, Kevin. You've lost it. You're completely gone. - And you're in love. - What, what the fuck does that mean? - I've been watching you two. - You've been what, you've been fucking watching us? Kevin, you killed an entire fucking family, man. - Just as you described. - No. No, you talk about words, words on a fucking page, man. You told me that you knew these fucking people, man. You said this place was gonna be empty. Listen. We are exploring new boundaries tonight, dude, and I just took what we had planned here and I tweaked things a little bit. - Kevin, I thought the plan was to invite a girl over and... - Yes? And then what? What did you think we were gonna do, Stu? - I don't know. - That right there. Your fucking inability to solidify an idea blows my mind. Blind ambition. - I thought we were gonna fuck with her head, man. I thought we were gonna freak her out a little bit with the music, maybe get laid. I don't know, something a little bit more fucking casual. - Fuck casual. I feel like I'm gonna be sick. - How about a brain storm. We'll just take one of your ideas here and snowball it into something. She left her shoes at the door-- - Give me that. - But her spirit followed after. - Kevin, give me that. - It's simple, that's for sure. But you know simple can be good. It gives us some fucking breathing room to dig in there. We are gonna make this work, Stu. We're gonna make this work. So she left her shoes at the front door, but her guts trail. Of all the fucking people who could have answered that ad, it had to be you! - She left her shoes at the front door but her head, her head hung in desperate despair. Fuck you, man! - She left her shoes at the front door, but her feet, her fucking feet at the front door. Stu. You know what this means, right? We have to cut off her feet. We have to cut her feet off. We're gonna cut off her feet. No. - I thought we we're all having such a good time. I do have some great news, though. Stu and I have been talking and we've finally come to a mutual decision about your involvement with the band. You see, sometimes there are conflicts of interests. Creative differences, forces at odds with one another. For example, naturally I know that you would like to keep your feet. But the thing is, we need your feet. Your contribution to the arts will not go unnoticed. - No, wait, wait, wait, Kevin, Kevin. Kevin, let me do it. - What? - I wanna do it. - I don't know, man. Seems like you're fucking with me. - No, no, no, I'm not. Look, you're not even gonna be able to get through her ankle bone with your skinny fucking arms, look, let me do it, I wanna do it, I need this, okay, I need this. Give me the knife, man. - Well, then I guess you're gonna have to get down here and put your fucking knee in her back. - All right, go upstairs, man. - What? - Fucking go upstairs, Kevin. I need you to go upstairs, find an iron, okay? And heat it up, get it real hot 'cause we're gonna have cauterize the wound or she's gonna fucking bleed out before we even start on the other foot. And also get me, find a roll of tinfoil and some mouthwash, and some dental floss, too, if you can find it. - What do you need all that for, Stu? - Because, Kevin, we're getting fucking weird tonight, man. - Yes. Yes, that is how you advance a creative partnership. Fucking teamwork. - Sh, sh, sh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay it's okay, it's all right, listen to me, listen. I am so sorry. This is not how the night was supposed to go down. Oh, fuck. Hey, listen, I just wanted you to know those words that you read earlier, that's not who I am, okay, this is not who I am. They're just words, stupid words, silly words, they don't mean anything. You know, I had a really good time with you tonight. I really did. I don't know, you made me feel good. Really good, most of the time my mind is going like this all the fucking time, I can't even shut it up, but you, you made it quiet. You slowed me down and it was really nice and I just wanted to tell you that. Before you write me off as a bad person. 'Cause I'm not a bad person. And I'm sorry that I lied to you in the car earlier, but fucking, Kevin, you know? He just, he's always, and he set me up, he fucking set me up, you saw this. I think what we have to do is, I'll go get Kevin and then we'll all sit down and we'll hash this shit out, okay? And we'll make it right. Okay, and then when that's over, we'll be done, we'll be free, we can start fresh. And then maybe we can, sorry, and maybe we can have a real date. You know, a cup of coffee, you can tell me, I don't know, whatever it is you're into. What do you say? What? What? Is that not good enough for you? 'Cause I'm running out of fucking ideas here! No. No. Do you think? Actually. No, that actually would. Hey Kevin, so about that... Hey, Kev, can I... Yeah, I could, you know what? Oh, hey, hey, if I were to do that, do you think you could find it in your heart to forgive me? Shh. - So check this out, I couldn't get everything you wanted, but I think I found some pretty cool toys definitely. No! Stu! Fucking do this to me. Don't you fucking do this to me. Stu! Stu. Help. Help me! No. - Stu. Thank you. - Hey. It's okay. It's gonna be okay now. Oh, it's okay, it's okay, hold on, let me get this. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not yet, okay? Just have a seat. We're safe now. I did it. We did it. And I know what you're thinking. Oh, I know. I owe you. Just for a second, I have a surprise. ¶ No, you will never learn ¶ No, you will never learn ¶ No, you will never learn - May I? ¶ Never learn, never learn - Look, I know that you may never look at me the same after tonight. And that's okay. That's okay. Because we have time. And I hope... I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Give us a chance. 'Cause I'd be good to you. And I can be kind. And I'll listen. I'll listen. I will. And I think, I know this sounds crazy, but I think that I love- - You wanna know what I think? You haven't listened to a single thing I've said all night. You lied to me. I could never be with someone like you. You're exhausting.
