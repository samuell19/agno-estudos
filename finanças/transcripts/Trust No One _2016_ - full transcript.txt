(radio chatter) (police sirens) (police sirens) What the hell's going on, Frank? What's with all the secrecy? Put this on. I didn't want to tell you over the phone and I don't want this getting out to the press. We got a situation here and it's not good. Who is it? Your star witness. Walter? What happened? We don't know. But that's why you're here. He's been asking for you. Damnit. You promised me nothing would happen. Walter, I'm here. Okay? We're going to fix this. That her? Yes. You said I would be safe! Shut up! Please don't kill me. I have kids! My name is Kate and I'm with the DA's office. You haven't killed anyone so we can end all of this right now. We can make a deal here. Alright? Put the gun down. Please do something. Please. I want immunity. Then I'll talk. You'll want to hear what I've got to say. What do we do? Tell him what he wants to hear. You! Get back! I want to talk to her. Get back! Tell him what he wants to hear. Okay. Okay, we can do that. How do I know I can trust you? Give him what he wants. I'm the DA. I speak for the office. If your info is good, we'll give you immunity. Okay. We're good. Come on, it's going to be good, alright? It's all good. Let Walter go now. Come on. Guess I got nothing to lose. (Gunshots) Walter! Walter! Quick, get her out of here. Walter! (Screams) No! No! The rat is down. What about Rocco? Took him out as well. And the Assistant DA? No. That's okay. We'll leave her for now. Lay low. Sure. Kate? It's not your fault. Then whose was it, Frank? Walter's? He trusted me. He... he believed in me and... And now he's dead. It was Vargano that orchestrated this. Yeah well we'll never know now, will we? Our hit-man is dead. Our star witness is dead. We've got nothing! I can't do it Frank. I can't do this anymore. The guilt is... it's just too much. Kate, what are you saying? I'm saying I'm handing in my resignation. As of tomorrow. If you resign, not only do they win but Walter loses, the justice system loses, we all lose. Don't give in to the guilt. You're the best attorney this office has ever had so I'm not going to accept your resignation just yet. Go home. Relax. And when you're ready, you come back to us. Okay? It's okay. So to what do I owe the honour of a visit from the District Attorney? I know it was you Vargano. We were going to nail you to the wall but you murdered our witnesses. I have two words for you: Got proof? Just as I thought. Next time you want to speak to me, you speak to my lawyer. I'm a busy man. Remember one thing Vargano. And what would that be? You're not the Teflon Don. You've already made a mistake. I don't know what it is but we'll find it. And when we do? It's going to be a very good day. You done? That's four things. Oh Frank can you say hello to the Assistant DA? What was her name? Kate. I've called this press conference today to make a brief announcement. There will be new charges in the State vs Vargano case. We are pursuing RICO charges for money laundering. Is it true that Mr Vargano made bail of $3 million until he awaits trial? Yes. His lawyers claim that this is a witch hunt and that he will be cleared of all charges. A criminal claiming he's innocent? Well that's a novel defense, even for Vargano. Is it true you have someone deep within the Vargano organization who is prepared to turn State Witness? I can neither confirm nor deny. Do you think that it's time for us to- That's all for today, thank you. Just one more question please? (phone rings) Excuse me. (phone rings) Entertain yourselves. Yep? He's heading towards his office. Take him down. Make sure the cockroach doesn't make it. Yeah sure thing. (Gunshot) We have breaking news. Earlier today businessman Lance Morgan was found murdered. Police have confirmed that this was an execution and that he may have been targeted. Our sources believe that he is the secret witness in the ongoing Vargano case which now appears to be on the verge of collapsing. (Sigh) Find out where Kate Mclntyre is for me. Mark to market aims to provide a realistic analysis of a company's current financial situation. So how is it different from other accounting methods? Well MTM values an asset based on current market price so for example if you bought a stock at $75 and sold it for $100, you would record it as $100 and recognize it as a gain of $25. Got it. Thanks. That will be all for today. I would like you to review Chapter 17, Ethics in Accounting. Class dismissed. You're a long way from the office. So are you. Yes, well. It's not so bad. It's time to come back. We both know this is a waste of your talents. Besides, I need you. Why? What's going on? I am 3 weeks away from the biggest case in my career and I've got nothing. Give me 5 minutes. Alright I'll listen. But no promises. I'm going to be honest with you Kate. My case is going down the drain. I thought we had Vargano. Yeah I saw it on the news. Executed in cold blood. I'm sorry Frank. We know he ordered the hit but we just can't prove it. If we can get him on the RICO charges for money laundering, then we can put him away for a long time. So what are you doing here? You're the best I've got, and I need you. I don't know, Frank. I need to think about it. Well, at least you didn't say no. You've got my number. (Gunshots) You did this. You killed me. No! (screams) I'm in. I want to put Vargano away. Hi. Welcome back. Thanks for the push. Well it was as much for you as it was for me. Vargano doesn't stand a chance. Alright, listen up everybody. This here is Kate Mclntyre. She's going to give us a fresh perspective. Kate, this is Greg. He's heading up the team. This here is Carl and of course you know Vivian. Alright, I'm going to leave you guys to it. Kate we appreciate you coming on. Thanks. Why don't we start with a debrief? Go ahead, grab a coffee and we'll see you in the conference room. Okay. Saw you testify in the Walden case. You were really great. Thank you. Hey. Do you want to leave your stuff right here? Yeah. And do you want a coffee? Yes. Come with me. So how much do you know? Vargano is a multinational, headed up by James Vargano. He's into money laundering, suspected of murder, with ties to organized crime syndicates around the world. Frank says that a whistle-blower triggered the investigation? Which doesn't help us now. The shooting at the building. He was on his way to meet Frank with the evidence. And now we've only got 2 weeks until the arraignment. Well if we don't find something right away, this is going to get thrown out. Exactly, so let's get at it. Carl, help Kate pull together whatever documents she needs. Sure. Alright? That's about it for now folks so let's see what we can find out. Lecturing is nothing like working on a case. Day three and you're already complaining? You've gone soft, Mclntyre. You know the only exercise I've had in the last month has been walking to the photocopier, pressing start, highlighting. Okay, I got it. You're right. But I haven't seen so many files. Yet Vargano still looks squeaky clean. I'm starting to wonder if there's anything to find. Yeah except that we have a dead witness. His family needs justice. Hey is that why you came back? To redeem yourself? Maybe. I just don't want to give up until we know the truth. (phone ringing) Yes? She's nosing around again. She's back on the case. She could be trouble. Keep an eye on her. Yeah, sure. (clears throat) I have a problem. Well when I have a problem, you have a problem. I don't want your excuses. I paid you a lot of money to make sure I'm clean so make sure I'm clean. She finds anything, it's on your head. Interesting. Carl! Take a look at this. What do you got? I did a cost benefit for the Benton acquisition and I can't figure out why Vargano went ahead. Was this checked out? We ran the numbers but it's not our smoking gun. Benton Holdings. Yeah. There's a lot of subjectivity in the valuation. This didn't lead anywhere? No, the assessment was solid. That's too bad. I really like them for this. Maybe this is the lucky file. Just like old times. Oh Jessica thank you. Did you find everything? Oh nothing I couldn't handle. I owe you a coffee. I've already had my lunch this week so... I'm surprised you got that. Coffee's perfect. (phone rings) Can I help you? I don't think so. Is the DA expecting you? I would assume so yes. Maybe you should wait outside. Kate, I see you've met Daniel. Thanks for this. I hope it wasn't too much trouble. Yeah no. No problem at all. I appreciate the change in scenery. Any progress? Not yet. What's your gut say? He's money laundering. And that they're very good at hiding their tracks. But there's something. Vargano paid way too much for a recent auisition but the team already checked it out so... Well keep digging. I'm counting on you. Frank. You know it's risky to go ahead with the arraiment. It's political suicide if I lose. Kate, could you close the door on the way out? (phone vibrates) Yeah. Let me know if she becomes a problem. ♪ ♪ Okay I gotta go. I promised I'm gonna try to see him at least once this week. Okay well listen let's pack it in for tonight and we can pick it back up again tomorrow. Yeah and I got a kid to put to bed so... Tomorrow? Tomorrow, my friend. Bye. Thanks, good work. Thank you. Whaddya say, time for one more? Why not? You know it's hard to believe that our paths haven't crossed before. When did you move to Pittsburgh? I have been here 6 months now. Well then we really wouldn't have really been running in the same circles. I've been teaching. By your choice I'm told. You've heard about the witness I've lost. I left the DA's office after that. I was told you were set up. A man lost his life because of me. You were a pawn just like he was. You've got a good reputation. Vivian's a gossip. You don't like compliments do you? All I meant was that we're lucky to have you. Thanks. It's good to be back. And yes, Vivian is a gossip. What did she say? Ah it's nothing I want to reveal right now but she obviously knows you very well. Yeah, we met right out of University. At Avcentro. You have done your research. I just like to know who I'm working with. So how did you get into forensic accounting? Yikes, a pretty standard story. Third generation accountant and after I got my CPA I decided that I really liked the investigative side of things so I went back and got my Masters. And the DA's office? Oh wait, you like to be where the action is. (Laughs) Come on, what can be more exciting for an accountant? (Laughs) Anything interesting? Not yet. I think I'm going to tackle 2009 next. What's the box number? I'll go to storage if you get refills. Oh yeah? You don't mind? Yeah. I know where everything is. Okay it's box #32. I've missed this. Oh I know, I love working on Sundays. You know what I mean. Thanks Viv! (explosion) (alarms ringing) Vivian! Vivian! Viv! Wake up, Viv! (alarm continues to wail) Vivian! (sirens) I love you too. Okay, bye. Hey. Want to trade? Thanks. If anything had happened to you, I... Did you hear from the hospital? Not yet. She was getting a box for me. Hey hey hey. You didn't plant the bomb. You saved her life. Got it? Yeah. Good. Now we should head on over to the station. Are you alright? Yeah. I'm fine. I can't believe this. What about Vivian? She's in a coma. (crying) (overlapping chatter) Okay everybody listen up. This here is Detective Leighton. Now, the police assume that the bomb was intended to destroy information inside the storage room but there were hundreds of case files in there. We can't be sure who or what the intended target was. We do know the bomb was triggered by a timer so whoever put it probably didn't expect anybody to be there that late. Unless the police uncover evidence connecting the bombing to Vargano, next week's arraignment is still on. I need to know if any of you want out. It's your choice. No judgements. You know my decision. I'm sorry guys. I didn't sign up for this. Neither did my family. Hey, we understand. It's okay, Carl. Um, guys. Can I get a minute? Yeah. There's no way I'm walking away from this. I figured as much so we're taking some precautions. You're going to work at a safe house until the arraignment. Safe house? Why can't we just get a new office? Carls right. If someone's prepared to blow up the DA's office, changing floors is not going to stop them. Hey, this is non-negotiable. Fine, yeah. Okay Greg, it's you and Kate. Detective Leighton is going to be responsible for you. Well don't you usually have marshals to do that kind of thing? Well if you have witnesses yeah, but we're in a bit of a grey area and I've called in some favours. Is this really necessary guys? I mean I think we can look after ourselves. This is not up for negotiation. Alright. They're all yours. Alright let's get this show on the road but first I need your phones Why? They can be traced. Come on. Thanks. Grab my purse. Yep. After you. Thank you. This is Officer McTierney. McTierney. Kate. Greg. Hello. Hi. Why don't you guys head upstairs, find a room and I'll go over the ground rules later, okay? Okay. I got you some things from the station. It's going to have to do until McTierney gets back. Oh, thanks. Okay. Everything is secure sir. Do you want me to stick around? No. That's good, we'll see you later tonight. Alright. Yeah. Hey it's good to have you back. Thank you. Not exactly what I had in mind but what are you gonna do, right? Alright. Have a good day. You too. Hey. Hi. She's going to be okay, you know. I hope so. So, what's the plan? Well Frank sent over laptops and any of the files that could be salvaged. Is this another precaution? I'm afraid so. He's a little much, don't you think? Who? John Wayne? Nah. If you guys are ready, we'll go over the house rules. Yeah. The entire house is secured. If a window or door is opened, the alarm will go off. The back patio is secure. We'll bypass the alarm on this door during the day so you guys can go outside. After you. Wow. Just so you know, the patio will be locked at night. Also, there is no phone or internet. But we need to access the server at work. Those are the rules. Are you kidding me? How are we supposed to get at the files? Through us. Myself or McTierney will always be here. What, the entire time? What is this? Kindergarten? No. Kindergarten would be a lot more fun. This is about making you safe. Don't you think it's a bit extreme? No more extreme than a witness being murdered or a bombing at the DA's office. Enjoy. (knocking) Hey. What's up? Any word on Vivian? No, no change. I want to go visit her. That's not an option. Can't I get an escort? What don't you get about this situation, Kate? Hey, I'm not the bad guy here. I never said you were. But you knew the deal when you signed up for this. Look. The best thing you can do for Vivian right now is work on the Vargano files. Frank will call if there's any change. Oh hey what happened to the janitor? Is he okay? What janitor? The janitor. I saw him getting into the elevator right before the bomb went off. There was nobody else reported working that day. Did you recognize him? No. I mean I haven't been back that long. Yeah, right. Get me any information about the janitors working the night of the explosion. No, tomorrow's too late. I need it tonight. (phone rings) Yes. Good. Relax, don't worry. When this is over you're going to be compensated very well. Get me a drink. (phone vibrates) We need to take a break. Yeah, 10 minutes. No, I mean now, all star. Let's take 5. (scoffs) Okay boss. Finally got through that first box. Oh boy. Forget about work, Kate. How you holding up? Can't stop thinking about Vivian. Why don't I go ask John Wayne to call the hospital. I already got an update. No change. You know I'm really glad you weren't hurt. That's crazy huh? I mean that's a little too close to the action for me. And what would your boyfriend think? Are you asking me if I'm single? I guess that wasn't very subtle, was it? No, no boyfriend. Maybe just a few dead plants by the time I get home. You? No it's just me and my plants too. But they're plastic. (laughs) Hey. So I checked into that janitor. Oh yeah? Yeah. Who was he? Someone who wasn't supposed to be there. I'm going to take you into the police station tomorrow, see if you can ID him. You think he planted the bomb? It's our best lead. How's the workoming? Oh everything leads to a dead-end, but it's all just a little too perfect. Meaning? Meaning Vargano is outperforming the rest of the industry in a time when everyone else is suffering. That is interesting. Greg thinks I'm overanalyzing it Isn't that what you get paid for? Are you okay? It's nothing. I got nicked. Nicked? You mean like shot? I'm healing. It's okay. You should probably call in Officer McTierney. I'm fine. Well maybe we should get back to work, huh? Yeah. Why don't you just give me a minute? Okay. I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk about your field exploits in front of Kate. Any particular reason why? Well she's got a lot on her mind. Hearing about your shortcomings doesn't help. She seems strong enough to me. You don't know her. Listen pretty boy, you got a problem with me? Feel free to leave at any time. So you can spend more time alone with her? Great protection. I don't think you want to go there. Just stay away from Kate. Or what? Detective, I just got a call from Tucker. Yeah. (t) Doctor's office. Dial 182 please. (machines beeping) (machines beeping) (gasp) Doctor! Good news. Vivian? Yeah, she's awake. I want to go see her. Yeah, let's go right now. That's not going to happen. Says who? I'm going. Okay. Call a cab. But if you leave this house, you're off the investigation. You know what? You're an ass. I'm going to get some air. Kate. Someone wants to talk to you. Hello? Kate? Viv! I heard you insisted on speaking to me. Oh my God. Thank God you're okay. The doctor said m going to be as good as new in a couple weeks. I'm so sorry Viv. No don't even go there. So you've heard about my new living arrangements. Only that you're hidden away somewhere until the arraignment. Any progress on the case? No. Nothing yet. But don't worry, they're not going to get away with this. (overlapping chatter) It's right in here. Hey! Partner! This is Kate. Kate, Detective Tucker. Hello. Unfortunately you're stuck with him for the next hour or so. You're not staying? No I've got a thing. A thing? Yeah. I'll see you in a bit. Your partner is an open book. Please. Yeah. (phone rings) Yeah! Yes. Yeah she's in with the cops. They've been in there the last hour. Take them out. That could bring down a lot of heat on you. Just do what I tell you to do. No. Nothing. Maybe we can get something from this. Take that to the DA's office. Maybe someone else might have saw him. Hey Einstein. It's not my first science fair. Sorry. Cabin fever. We should get going. I'll let you know if something surfaces. Thanks Detective. (radio chatter) You know we're only 5 minutes from the hospital. Not now Kate. This is Detective Leighton. I need a run on license plate DTN 3476. Copy that. The car was stolen. What's your location? I'm heading west on Pine just east of the I-5. Send backup and connect me with Detective Tucker. What's going on? Yeah we're being followed. I'm heading to the underpass. I'm on my way. What do they want? Let's not find out. Hold on. (screeching tires) (car honking) Tucker'll have to take care of him. We're going to have to change cars. You okay? Hi. How'd it go? Someone knew we were there. What do you mean? A leak? Either that or they were watching the police station. Well I hope it was worth it Leighton. Kate could have been killed. Well maybe if you'd been driving. How do I know we're safe here? Greg, I'm fine. Unless you ordered a pizza while we were gone, the only person who knows we're at this location is my captain. Why doesn't that comfort me? Come on, let's get a drink and get back to work. Greg, you're making me nervous. How can you work after what happened? I'm trying not to think about it. Well you're doing a better job than I am. What are you looking at? I'm still stuck on this Benton file. The acquisition? Yeah. Yeah, something just doesn't add up. Benton is a holding company for Vargano and if Enron taught us anything it's that we should always be suspicious of holding companies carrying excessive debt. I've looked into Benton. It's being funded by independent equity investors. Not Vargano. The arraignment's in 4 days, Kate. That's a dead end. Alright? Just trust me on this one. (shower running) Hello? Jessica, it's Kate. Kate? Are you okay? Yeah, I am. Listen I only have a second. I need you to get me some information on a company called Benton Holdings and I need it right away, like tomorrow. Of course, I'll give it to Frank. No, no I don't want to go through the regular channels. Listen can you drop it off at Beach and Rivercrest? There's a body shop there. Just put it behind the dumpster right up against the wall. Okay? Yeah. I'll be there. No just drop it off there sometime before midnight. Are you sure about this? Yeah, yeah it'll be fine. Listen I got to go. And Jessica, don't tell anyone. Of course. I gotta go. Kate? Yeah, it's Leighton. There's been a development. (shower running) Here goes nothing. (alarm wailing) Are you okay? I opened the window! I didn't know! Close it so I can turn the alarm off! (alarm continues to wail) (cell phone rings) What's going on? Kate opened the window. It's fine. Leighton. No, somebody here just opened the window. Yeah, I'm turning it off. Okay, it's all good, thanks. I was just trying to clear the steam. Try and be more careful, alright? Sorry. Detective Leighton. Yeah? Leaving? As soon as McTierney gets here. Did they catch that driver? No not yet. So we'll never know? We're assuming it's related. Then I can think of worse places to be. Yeah. When will you be back? Later tonight. Do you need something? No. No I was just wondering. Okay. Try not to give McTierney a hard time, okay? I have stared at the same column for the past 5 minutes. I think I'm done. You're right, it's late. Yeah. Let's go have a drink. Oh, I'm too tired. Come on. Keep me company. I've been letting it breathe. You come prepared. Well McTierney did me a favour. 2009 Brunello. Mmm. You're going to love it. And there you go. Thanks. I've got a blue cheese in my fridge at home that would go perfect with this. How inconvenient. I can't wait to get back to my own place. Well you know there are some perks to being here. Oh uh... Am I interrupting? No. No, um, I was just leaving. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Kate. It's me Jessica! What are you doing? I told you not to stay! I had to make sure you were okay. I can't believe someone blew up the file room. I know. It's crazy. We have to go through metal detectors and the 5th floor is still off limits. I just can't wait for this to be over. So why all this secrecy with Benton? It's just something that I need to do. Is it all here? Yeah everything in the archives or online so... Thank god for public records. Oh and I saved copies in our shared folders. Do you know the password? It's Frank's birthday? Yeah. Oh, you're the best. Okay I gotta get going. Thank you! I owe you. Stay safe. Yeah I will. Oh! You can't tell anyone. What the hell do you think you're doing? What is your problem? I was just out getting some air. Bullshit. How'd you get past the alarm? I saw the code. Big deal. We can go on the patio right? You must think I'm an idiot, don't you Kate? How'd you get that? It's confidential. Not from me, it's not. Okay if you must know, this is new information on Vargano. You took a stupid risk. Who else knows that you're here? No one. Don't toy with me, Kate. How did you get this information? Someone from the office met me, okay? About a mile from here. I need a name. Jessica Hall. It's not her fault, okay? This was all my idea. It was a bad idea. I'm not going to apologize for doing my job, alright, so if we are done here, I'm going to bed. (gasps) You scared me. Sorry, I heard some voices. Is everything okay? Yeah, I just couldn't sleep. Anything you want to talk about? No. I'm pretty tired, actually. Okay well, good night. See you in the morning. Knock knock. Super nanny, it's about time. I got better things than to wait around for you. Well I would have made more of an effort if I knew you missed me so much. Always. You find the driver? Janitor? Strike two. Pal, you gotta give me something. It's all dead ends. We pulled Greg Nealon's bank statements, phone records. Nothing there either. Well he's a forensic accountant. Not the kind of guy who's going to leave a paper trail, right? Did he make any new purchases? He bought a Porsche but that's not a crime unless you count the fact that it's a boxster. Yeah. What about the assistant? Jessica? Yeah. Clean. I'm still talking to her but I want to expand the investigation to include Kate. Really? Yeah. She snuck out last night. I don't know if she's part of this or just plain crazy. Where'd she go? She said she went to meet with Jessica. Let's keep an eye on both of them. Now tell me, how's Kate holding up after your adventure in the alley? Well it didn't seem to scare her all that much. Hmm? She snuck out last night. That doesn't sound like her. Can she be trusted? I've known her since she was a kid. She claims she's getting info from someone in your office. Jessica Hall? And? I spoke with Jessica and she cracked in about 30 seconds. Sounds like a new record. What were the files? Everything she could find on Benton Holdings. Maybe Kate's on to something? Maybe. But she didn't tell Greg. Interesting. Very. Those two, they seem kinda close. You sound jealous. Jealous? Hardly. Kate's a pain in the ass. If you say so. She's got good instincts, she just needs to trust them. Reminds me of someone else I know. And who might that be? I don't know. Somebody else I know. I have a confession to make. But it's a good thing. I did some additional research on Benton and I found it. You found what? Greg, it's all in here. Benton is an offshore special purpose entity. Kate we already know that. But Vargano reported it as an arm's length acquisition when in fact it was incorporated by Vargano but under his mother's maiden name. Vargano always controlled it, Greg. He took shareholders money to buy it at an inflated price. That's where he's laundering the money. I know it. How did you find this? I thought their profits and assets were too inflated, even for a company this size. And uh... Well the team already looked into the files at the office, so I thought to check into Benton prior to the Vargano purchase. But how did you get your hands on those documents? I had someone at the office pull the files for me. But Greg, this is even bigger than we imagined. Benton is one of a dozen holding accounts that Vargano set up. I think we're talking about another Enron here. Kate, who knows about this? No one. I wanted to tell you first. Okay. Show me exactly what you found. I can't believe I missed this. We needed the historical records. Kate, this is huge. Listen don't tell the cops anything. If there is a leak we can't trust anyone. I've got to tell Frank. Yeah. (knocks) Yeah? Hi. I need to check in with the DA. Sure. There you go. Thanks. Greg Nealon for the DA. (tires screeching) Excuse me. Yeah. You anxious? Pardon? It's a big day for you. You ready? Oh uh, yeah. It's really coming down to the wire. Well it can't be easy for you. You're cut off from friends, family. Yeah. Look I'm sorry that I've been such a pain in the ass. It's okay. You've had to deal with bombs, car chases. No big deal. That's true. And also it's my first case in awhile so... By choice? Yeah, you could say that. My last job left me a little gun shy. Frank mentioned we might have something in common. My last case went south too. Is that when you got shot? Yeah. Yeah, so, you know how it feels. I mean I just don't want history repeating itself. Are you trying to explain last night's James Bond antics? Right, I wish. It's more like Maxwell Smart. And you're really intimidating you know? You could have fooled me. Well I do have a good poker face, and years on the stand. Hmm. I'll have to remember that. Just promise me you'll be more careful. I promise. Thanks. Yeah. Kate, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure. Frank is ecstatic. Okay. Great so I'll start prepping the files. Yeah. There's no rush though. We've got some time. Alright. You know what? I think I'm going to work out. It'll help clear my head. Do you want to meet back in an hour? Sure that's a good plan but listen... Frank agrees. There's definitely someone working from the inside. You mean the DA's office? Yeah. Could be anybody. What, Daniel? Oh no, I doubt it. Frank was really clear... we have to keep this confidential, between the two of us, alright? Yeah. ...struck while crossing the street. Ms. Hall was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities are looking for a black SUV. Anyone with information about the hit and run is asked to contact the police. What is it? Jessica. On TV? She was hit by a car. What? This isn't an accident. Jessica is the one who brought me the Benton files. Somebody knows. Yeah but who would she tell? No one. I told her specifically. I told Daniel about the files. He knows that the files are from Jessica? Yeah. Where are the files? It was right here. It's gone. The file, the memory stick, everything is gone. That proves it. Leighton is involved. Jessica put a copy in the shared folder. On the team server? God, why would someone hurt Jessica? Kate, focus. Who has access? No one. It's a password. Give me the password. Greg, we gotta get out of here. Kate listen, he's got a gun. We've got to act normal. I'll tell him I have to speak to the DA again. Give me the password. Frank has it. Tell him it's under the file named Benton. Okay. Go to your room and lock your door. Be careful. It's Nealon. You scare tactic didn't work. She figured it out. You said you had it covered. Yeah well she went behind my back. Well that changes everything. It's time for you to get your hands dirty. That was never part of the deal. What do you think the $2 million is for?! Look, there's a cop here 24/7. What do you expect me to do? How about a tragic fire where no one survives? That's not going to solve anything. They copied the files to the DA's server. Greg! You listen to me and you listen good. You get me those damn files, or you're dead. I can't without internet access. Or the password. Alright I'm not going to kill you. I'll cut out your tongue. Kate knows how to get them. She can help you. Good. Just make sure there's no problems. I'm going to send some friends. You do what you gotta do to get those files. Understood? Cops. Just in for a refill. Can I get you one? Yeah. Why not, thanks. There you are. Thanks Greg. Enjoy. (knocks) Okay the police are on their way. Did Daniel suspect? No. I can't believe this. Listen, you stay here. I'll come and get you when it's time. Okay. Hey buddy. How was your coffee? Won't be needing this. It's done. (nervous breathing) (knocking) It's the police. No wait, the alarm. Wait, it's already off? Where's the cop? Down the hall, up the stairs. What the hell is going on? I trusted you! Kate, don't. Was that necessary? Don't be stupid, he's got a gun. Come on. Come on. Take care of him. We're not going back to Pittsburgh? We don't know who's working for Vargano. You're staying hidden. But Frank needs us to the rebuild the files. You're working from a new location. Everything is arranged. We're setting you up at the Centennial Motel. (gasp) It's okay. You're safe now. (fighting grunts) (gunshot) Your internet. Work fast. Thirsty? No. Are you okay? Yeah I'm fine. Just under a lot of pressure. Because we can fix this. You're so nalve. Greg, what's wrong? Just stop talking, okay? Just find the files, okay? Shouldn't we call Frank? Forget about Frank for now, okay? Just get those files. You know, maybe I will take that drink. Gotcha, coming right up. Alright. There you go. Alright I'm logged in so I just need to think of the password. You don't know the password? Just give me a minute, okay? It's been awhile. Um, Sammy? No. Brownie? What is it Kate? What is it? It's Jessica's dog. I'll remember it. Would Vivian know what it is? Okay, Greg? You need to back off, give me some space. Alright? Thank you. I just need to think. Charlie? No. Jesus Kate, it's a dog's name right? How hard can that be? Okay if you would stop yelling at me Greg maybe I could think. Lucky. No. Pepper. Pepper, no. Mmm. (coughs) This is so strong. Could you put some soda in that? Yeah give me that. Thanks. There you go. Okay, I'm in. Alright alright. Where's the Benton folder? It should be there. No it's not there. It's not there. Well of course it is. No, it's not there. Find it. Find it! Come on. It's got to be there. Maybe she just put it under another name. Oh no no no, you bitch. No no no. (screams) Don't even think about it! How could you? Kate nobody was supposed to get hurt. The bomb? Vivian was almost killed! That was your fault. That wasn't my fault. That was you. And Jessica? How did you know? What did you think I'm dumb? Think I'm stupid? You're a monster. And you let me think that it was Daniel? Oh my god, what have you done to him? No amount of money is worth this. Oh you think I'm calling the shots? Doing their dirty work makes you just as guilty! Shut up! (grunts) (grunts) You have no idea what you've done. Kate, you've ruined everything! You have no idea what you've done! Augh! (gunshots) Get back here you little bitch! Drop the gun! I said drop it! That's a good, good little doggy. (grunts) Kate! Kate! Kate I can't let you go! (grunts) I thought you were supposed to be a tough guy, hey? (rapid nervous breathing) Kate! Why didn't you just let well enough be? Kate! Come on, come out. I know you're here. Kate. Kate. The others, I did for money. You? I'm going to do for fun. Kate! Why couldn't you leave well enough alone? We could have been a couple, Kate. Now look at what you're forcing me to do! (grunts) (grunts) Now I get to see the fear in your eyes before I kill you. (gunshot) Kate. Just lower the gun. It's okay. Come here. It's over. It's over. (sirens wailing) (radio chatter) Thanks. Thank you. I'm sorry I didn't trust you. Well that's okay, I didn't trust you either. What do you mean? How else do you think I found you? After you snuck out I put a GPS transmitter in your purse. I thought, you know when Jessica was hit, you were the only one that I told. What else could you think? He fooled a lot of people. Thank God you're okay. Frank. Greg was working for Vargano. Makes sense now. Trust you to figure it out. Well I almost didn't. Well I never doubted you. And you? Good job. Thank you. Alright Kate, you can do the honours. You're going to spend the rest of your life behind bars, for money laundering and murder. How's the track record at the DA's office? I employ real lawyers. Yeah well so did Gotti. Take this garbage out of here. We're not done, Kate. Send me a postcard from whatever hole they bury you in. (chuckles) See you back at the office. So now that this is all over, I was wondering... Wondering? Yeah, if you'd maybe consider having dinner with me some evening? Dinner? Yeah. I just want the chance to show you my soft side. Your soft side? Really? Wow, that would be something. I think I'm going to have to say yes just to find out. Fantastic. What do you say Italian Friday night? I don't really like Italian. Oh, okay. How about sushi? Sushi? Chinese! Hmm. Now we're talking.
