[roaring] [loud gong] [speaks in foreign language] [speakerphone] Attention, please. Will all passenger flying with Fox Airways for St. Denis, Paris and London, please assemble at the south exit. [man] Who have we got this time, Foxy? [Fox] Oh, the usual mixed bag. Film star Joanna Dane and her boyfriend, Cormack and his manager. - [man] The boxer bloke? - [Fox] Yeah. And some sort of a singer, Antont Perami. [man] Never heard of him. [Fox] Neither have I. The rest are quite normal. Oh, except for that fellow in the iron lung. - [man] Barber? - [Fox] Hmm. I'll be glad to get rid of that frail burl. Mind that wheel. - That's right. - It's alright, Madame. I'll lift him. Thank you all. I'll look after him, now. [planes flying overhead] Okay. Tell the others to come aboard, will you? - I want to get on it. - Right. I hope you won't be too uncomfortable, Mr. Barber. We might be in for a few bumps between here and St. Denis. I'm alright. We've been on quite a few trips like these, Captain Fox. Course? Yes! Going on these Oh, sorry. Stupid cod. John, he didn't mean it, I think he's just clumsy. Alright, alright. How long is this last stop? Only an hour, I hope. But Mother and Father are going to meet us in St. Denis. And Dr. Culpick. - A mythical man. -And then Dr. Culpick. [engines roaring] Miss Dane. Mister Faber. Mind the step. SignorPerami. Mister Marshall. Mister Jimmy Marshall. Mister Cormack. Mister Gunn. There's no smoking until after the take-off, please. Mister Romer. Mister Barber and Miss Stephens. I'm Captain Haverton. Bill to you. How about the weather, Foxy? Don't flap, I'm going for the pass. I just like to be sure. Fasten your safety-belts, please. [engines whirring] I don't like the look of these clouds. See if you can get the weather from St. Denis. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. What's the matter? It's so slow. It's so slow. Are you getting off at St. Denis? Yes. Like you? Yes, we are. My wife is waiting there with my mother. I haven't seen them for eight years. Because of the war? Yes. Because of the war. I've got the weather, better make a detour, Foxy. Foxy? What's the matter? Starboard engine. Low oil pressure? [engine buzzing] Get Mary to tell them not to worry. Mary, trouble. I can see that. Starboard engine. If it fails, you've got to be there to tell them everything's alright. And is it? Foxy's gonna cross the glacier there, storm or not. If we can get over the top before the engine does fail, we'll make it. On one engine? Yes, if we can get over the top first. But no panic. You mustn't let them panic. Alright, Bill. No panic. [engine buzzing] What's happening? Keep your head on, Eddy. There's a fault in one engine, it's alright, there's nothing to worry about. Cpt. Fox is going straight over the mountain to St. Denis. It'll be a bit bumpy, so you better fasten your safety belts. We'll be alright. Cpt. Fox is a good pilot. Should've a thrill. How are you taking it? The way I take everything. Laying down. I've sent out the petition, but the storm is mucking up the signal. - Foxy! - Shut up. Look at that. Look, I know I have a blasted half a minute. We're losing a hundred feet a minute, - what are you gonna do? - Get in that seat there. Come up, you... She won't do it. You better try for the pass. My last pair. [Fox] I can't make it, Bill! I can't! I'll have to put it down on the ice. No! You can't land here! You'll kill us all! Here we go, Bill. [loud crash] Mary! Mary, are you alright? [Mary] I'm alright. There's a torch somewhere. Never mind that! The fire extinguisher! - [John] Joanna! - [Joanna] Help me! - Help me with this lung! - Are you alright? Mary! Mary, get the door open! It is open! Is it on fire? No, no, there's no fire. - Is he alright? - Yes, he's fine. If only I could move, get on my feet. Do something! He's banged his head in. He'll come around in a moment. I'm so frightened. Darling, don't go away! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Steady, darling, steady. [Perami] Look where you walk! Your feet! My record! You clumsy fool! Look what you do! I beg your pardon, sir? You thread and you break! Look! You break in pieces! One! Two! Three! Four! All break! All smashed! Well... There's no fire, anyway. No. Look, that one got out first. What's the damage here? [laughs] No damage, I'm just hysterical. Oh, dear, I must look simply awful. Darling, get me my little case, will you? Which case do you mean? The one with all the bottles, and creams and stuff? Yes, my little case. Find it. You wouldn't mean that, would you? Who did that? Don't stand there grinning at me like an ape! Who did it? Oh! You idiots! Port-wing smashed, starboard engine gone, and the guard busted. And this. You can't say I'm not thorough. You did a good job, Foxy. Nobody is hurt. What a place to be in. Why don't you get in on that blasted radio and see if you can get us out of it? [wind blowing] [wind howling] [tapping] Are you getting anything, Bill? No, not a damn thing. One of my batteries What? Why don't you look after the blasted radio? It was alright until you dropped it. [Jimmy] Back up, Perami, get it going. What's going on? Skipper, we've got all the comforts of home here. Wine, women, and now a bit of song thrown in. Thank you, James, that'll do. Why? What do you mean? Who's going to sing? Perami has a gramophone and a record. A record. Just the one record. One saved from this clumsiness. That's it, Perami, you tell them. Hey, Mr. Marshall, I think I will have a shot of whiskey after all. You crazy? Leave that stuff alone, kid. He's still on the radio. [Mary sighs] Come on, Mary. You've got a lot to do. That's alright. Though, I'm not giving way. Just getting a bit of delayed action shock, I suppose. - You're not hurt? - No, no. Give me a cigarette. If you've got any. We've got two or three. Here. [music playing on the gramophone] How bad is it? Depends on the storm. I can't get anybody on this thing. Poor boy in the iron lung. Yes. Him more than the others. Poor me. And poor everybody. All of us, but you. Don't you ever get rattled like anybody else? And scared and cold inside, as if there were a bird in your stomach? I know what you mean. No. You're not scared. I never know how you feel. I've told you how I feel about some things. About you, for instance. Bill, you don't know me. Not in two months. I know you. I've watched you being unhappy, that's when you know people. Yes. You're sweet about it. You can't go on being like this. Keeping everything locked inside because of someone dying. Not when someone was everyone. Everyone and everything I ever wanted. No. - Listen, Bill, I-- - No. Not now, you listen. [music playing on the gramophone] The pianissimo with open throat. You hear? Listen. Only I and Gilly in the whole world. Listen. [music continues] [record scratching] You see what you do? This one is break too. Every one I have is spoiled. Every damn one I have! - You see? - Stop it! Stop it, you idiot! Don't you understand? - [record stops] - [Joanna] Don't you see? We're lost. We're all going to die! How can you sit here and pretend? We're all going to die! [cries] Oh, my dear. George-Peter-one calling St. Denis control. George-Peter-one calling St. Denis control. [wind blowing] Well, come on, then! Tell us! Tell us! I sent a call to tell them where we are. But I can't get an answer. There's too much interference because of this storm. So we stay here for the night. Or longer. I refuse to stay. You're lucky to be here. We got away with a landing and no one is even hurt. You ought to be thankful. We cannot be lost, now. They must be at St. Denis. You must tell them! My wife-- If your wife worried about you as much as you do, Mr. Romer-- [Fox] Shut up! Everybody shut up. Cpt. Fox, I'm well aware that we are fortunate to be alive, but what chance have we got to be found here or rescued? And what can we do? What do you want to do? Put the cat out? We're lost, aren't we? [wind howling] [Edward] Wind isn't dropping, is it? [Richard] No. I hate it. It's frightening. Like the end of the world up here. Nothing living, except us. The most concerning thing when one's frightened is to find someone who is even more frightened. Not counting women, of course. Joanna is the only woman who is. That fellow Romer... Yes, he jumped when we landed. Typical neurotic continental type. Boring, isn't he? My parents are. I was born and brought up in the Argentine. Oh. I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep. I was thinking. About all of this? About myself. You feel sorry for yourself. You think so? I suppose I am. You want to talk to me about him, don't you? Why do you say it like that? You always ask me to talk about him. Yes, but not now, not any more. Doesn't make sense up here. But it does. Dying isn't remote up here. I used to think I wouldn't mind dying. Because of him. Not so close. I'm afraid. If you were in love, it would be forever, wouldn't it? Isn't that the way love should be? But he's dead. [sighs] Yes. He's dead. [Fox] 1730 hours. Forced landing on Fellhof glacier due to failure of starboard engine. Nineteen hours to 2330 hours. Called out Hallsberg and St. Denis and transmitted our position. But received no confirmation of receipt due to static. 2350 hours. Efforts continuing. An attempt will be made tomorrow to make the plane visible from the air. [scrapping sounds] Anybody wanted a coffee? [snoring] Thank you. Coffee? Look out, clumsy! Harry Now, maybe they'll find us. They'd find us more easily if you would help dig the snow away. So they can see us. Yeah, that's right, Come on, Harry, let's do our work! Great kid. Wonderful kid. Hello. Awake? I've got some nice hot coffee for you. I'll give it to him. - Thanks. - No, you won't. I don't want any, give it to someone else. You really ought to have something. Listen, go away and leave me alone, will you? - I know what I want. - John. Heavens, you two. Why don't you stop fussing and leave me alone? Why do you shout? Do you think anyone here is having fun? No. I'm sorry. Joanna? Wake up, darling. No. Darling, was I horrible last night making that frightful scene? I think everybody understood. You let off steam of all of us. Thank you, darling. Oh, good. Something hot. You forgive me, then? There's nothing to forgive. All these people, so awful. Don't you think so? Richard. No, I... Darling, I'm going out to help. [breathing mechanism noises] Excuse me. How can they ever get us away from here? I don't know John, but they will. But they can't land here in this place, how could they? You're only fooling yourself, but don't do it for me. Now, come on. Drink this. [wind howling] [sighs] It's a smashing view, anyway. That's one thing. It's a real treat. Specially if you was looking at it from a seat in the pictures, eh? They must come for us. And if they don't, there are ways down from here. Ways down? From here? Do you know this part of the world, then? Not here, no. Further to the Northwest I know, during the war. Oh. You in the army, then? No, I was trying to escape. What do you mean? Deserting? In a way. From a concentration camp. Oh. Sorry. Hey, Cormack! Put that thing out! You're standing on a petrol tank. [Bill] Hey, Foxy. What about all this petrol? The tank is badly damaged, you know? If anything, we ought to let it soak away. Don't be a fool, it will drain down towards the aircraft, not away from it. - OK, you are the boss. - Yeah. Boss of nothing. No, I mean it. You're the prettiest girl I've ever met. How many girls have you said that to? Thousands. You're not very original. That doesn't matter. Girls like old favorites. Makes them feel they know where they are. Your brother is watching you. Don't remind me. He's been watching me for years. Were you two on a holiday together? Holiday? Edward? Edward never has a holiday. No, as a matter of fact, he's been getting me out of the soup. Oh? Were you on the soup? Frankly, I'm always in the soup. Each time it happens, along comes Eddy, bails me out, makes me take a horrible job somewhere. You know? For brothers, you're not a bit alike. No. Before Edward was born, mother was frightened by an epidemic. James! Captain Fox wants you. Alright, Alright. Can't he tell me himself? Now, listen to me, I want to tell you something. They'll be out looking for us, now. So someone's gotta stay outside the plane on watch the whole time, in case we hear them and can send up a signal. There's a very pistol in the aircraft. We'd better keep watch in pairs, - haven't we, Foxy? - Yes. Romer, you and Cormack. You're on first. Then you, Mr. Marshall, with your brother. No, I'll go with Faber or Gunn. Edward here can have Pagliacci if he'll put his dainty feet on the ground. That's Mr. Marshall's blanket you're taking. So? I'm Anton Perami. I am a singer, and my throat and chest must be protected. Yes? Good. So I take care. Why don't you go outside and help the others? In that cold wind? You think I'm crazy? [John] I think you're lousy. My make-up case. You've taken it! What did you say? Mind my gramophone! Now, where is my make-up case? And my cold cream? Good heavens, we had a crash. This is since the crash. And you can only worry about cold cream? Only? I tell you I have to have it. Alright, don't lose your head again. Go and ask Fox. He tore in some mess around this morning. I heard him curse it. He did, did he? [Fox] There are quite a few civil and amenity area joints in these parts. And they're bound to be sending planes out with search parties. It's gonna be a bit difficult for them to find this spot with these clouds hanging about. You smeared my face-cream all over the floor! Face-cream? Did I? Oh, that's what it was. Well, I'm sorry. But I've got to have my cream, my face gets sore without it! Well, I'd dare say Mary can lend you a bit of powder or something. You pompous, superior fool. "A bit of powder or something." Oh! You make me sick! Take it easy. If she didn't blow up once in a while, she'd probably go crazy. Joanna, wait! Now, leave her alone, boy. Always leave them alone when they're shouting. I can see her point, mind you. A woman her age, she needs the make-up much more. I didn't ask for your opinion. Well, she's been a star for 14 years, you know? She can't be a spring chicken. - What's the matter? - You. You have such bad manners. [music playing] For heaven's sake! Turn that thing off before the needle jumps. I watch him. That's the tenth time you've played that thing. Haven't you got another tune? Tune? Barbarian! You call this a tune? No, I have not! Because why? Because they are all broke. All the records, except--! Oh, dear, oh, dear. No, not again. This again! Now, look, Perami... - [needle jumping] - Oh! Well, thank goodness. You would prefer some of your films here instead, huh? Lots and lots of Joanna Dane pictures. Like a festival, huh? From now, going right back for 20 years. Twenty years? You tinpot, operatic windbag! Sitting in here hour after hour, driving everybody crazy! Playing your boring record! - Why, I--! - Joanna, you've said enough! How much grub have we got? Right up, but not quite enough for the day. Well, it will have to last longer than that. Fox, somebody's being here. What do you mean? I had six packages of sandwiches, - now, I've only four. - What? Well, don't say anything about it to anybody else just yet. And you better give everybody something to eat now. [whirring] You're not going to work that? Bill's saving it. He says the battery hasn't very long, there's only enough for another couple of signals. I told you to give these people something to eat, didn't I? Why don't you do as you're told? [wind blowing] [engine roaring in the distance] Listen! Yeah, I thought I heard something too. Over there! Going away. Miles away. Several of them, too. Alright, it's time to change the watch, anyway. It's Marshall and Faber next. Suits me. I'm ain't fit for cold storage. I will stay instead of Mr. Marshall. I feel better here than inside. Alright? You look half frozen now. No, I have more resistance than most people. Yes? You eat more, perhaps? Alright, come on, I'll tell it to Faber. The first dangerous thing that ever happened to me. There was the war. Not for me. I was with my family in the Argentine. No, I've always been safe. And comfortable. This weather's been bad for me. I've had everything I've wanted. All my life. Always to be safe... I wonder how that could feel. [Richard] Why? I was in prison three times. Since I was 18. In prison? What for? Because I spoke my own thoughts instead of theirs. I thought they were stupid to put me in a concentration camp to try to kill me. Stupid. Because there one thinks even more. And then hates them more. But in the end, the thinking and the hating dies away. Everything dies away. An old myth died there too. That suffering ennobles mankind. It was a myth before they came. Because no people had ever suffered to that point. When man becomes less than himself. And goes backwards. backwards in its heart, in his mind and his body. Until he's made into a thing, with only one spark, wanting to live. It's the bottom of the pit, Mr. Faber. Do you think we'll get out of this? Or die? Do you think you'll be saved? I will save myself. [wind blowing] [buzzing] It's no good, the batteries are finished, now. Foxy was sending for hours this morning. Kicked me off for sticking my nose in. Foxy bullies machines when they won't do what he wants them to. He likes machines better thank he likes people. They have to be perfect You saw him he hated the thing. I see you've made quite a study of him. Why not? I spend most of my time with him. It wasn't so easy for me. I tried to guess what somebody was thinking and feeling. A man you were in love with. Yes. I watched him change slowly. Grow up the way young men have never had to grow up before. Like you grew up, I suppose. Flying bombers. At first, he was so gay. H was always gay. But his eyes changed. He saw those things you saw. What horror? The ruin, the killing. [clattering] It didn't change him out quickly. Just seemed to make him love me... That's what I watched for. When was he killed Mary? Last day of the war. Only one more day to live through and he would've been safe. With me. Mrs. Hugh Collins Hugh Collins? Squadron leader Hugh Collins? You knew him? - Yes, I knew him. - [Mary] Well? He's dead and it's finished, Mary. Go on, say it. Say it. You didn't like him, is that it? And now you hate him because I'm in love with him. Because he's spoiling your life. - You hate him. - He was no good. Collins was a twister and a liar. He'd sold you or any other girlfriend. Sorry, I didn't mean to say that, but... But what? I had to because it's true and you know it's true. Yes, I know. I always knew. Anybody's cheating, lying to me. If you knew, why did you go along with it? Because I was in love with him. His being no good didn't alter that. You don't understand, do you? I can understand what is like to be in love with someone who is not in love with you. How alone it makes you feel. [sobbing] Bill... are we going to die? Some of us, I expect. [wind blowing] Anything left to eat? Half a thermos of coffee and a few sandwiches. Almost nothing. I've heard that Romer used to have some grub. James, I told you not to say that. - Hold on a minute, say what? - Romer swiped some of the food. - That is, he might have. - Might? Edward saw him coming out. The evidence is purely circumstantial. [Fox] Oh, forget it and listen to me. We've got to take a chance at getting down on foot. Say, three or four of us. Bill here has the maps. [Bill] There's a village at the top of the pass, St. Christoph. It's about 12 miles as the crow flies. Who's gonna make up the four? You better stay here, Foxy. Just in case. Edward and I have done a bit of climbing. I'll have a bang at it. Besides, I've... run out of whiskey. Yes, I'll go. I'll go. Are you crazy? You've got a job ahead of you, kid. Yeah? Like a life ahead of me to do it, gentlemen. There's another reason why we must go. You're talking about me, aren't you? Because I am the added responsibility. - Well, don't bother. - Don't, John. Don't make it any worse. Get away from me! [loud thuds] Alright, goodbye and good luck. Goodbye, Bill. Take care of yourself. Alright, if you'll do me a favor. - Something you've never done. - What? Miss me. That's all, just miss me. - Goodbye, Foxy. - Sure, Bill. Good luck. [Bill] All set? Good bloke, eh? Yes. Good bloke. [crunching snow] What chances have they got, Foxy? Evens. Come on. Come on in and give them all some breakfast. It's the last of the coffee. There's nothing more to eat. What are you staring at? Go away. You used to like it. Yes, when I knew I looked nice. These awful people. So boring. They don't bore me. Oh, they don't? Well, they bore me. And when you're being so silly, so do you. That's good, it makes us even. - It's about two mouthfuls each. - Oh, I don't want any. It'll have to last. Until they can drop us something. When? - Next winter? - Thank you. A little music with breakfast, yes? [everyone] No! [wind blowing] You alright, sir? I'm not an old man. A few hours of walking isn't gonna killing me. Well, go on, then. - Wait, listen! - [rumbling] Yeah! Look! There it is. [engine roaring] A plane. A lovely bloomin' aeroplane. Here! Here we are, you silly baskets! It's not us he's looking for. No. No, he's going away. Well, we're not the only people in the world, that's one thing. Come on. Midday. They ought to be well on the way by now. Eh? You think so? Perhaps, with luck. If that boy gets frostbite on his hands... You don't want the cold to bite the hands that feed you. Very funny. Of course, you feed yourself. Don't you? I wish I had gone with them. - Why? - Doing something definite not just waiting. It's like saying goodbye when they left, a long time. Yes. You see people more clearly when they are gone. At least I do. - It sounds crazy. - No. - [rumbling] - Listen. The plane! Do you hear it? They are looking for us! Look, Fox, there it is! I'll get the very pistol! Oh! They see an aeroplane. - [Fox] Perami! - [Perami] An aeroplane for us, huh? [Fox] Perami, get the very pistol! [Perami] Oh, an aeroplane! Quickly, gun! [engines roaring] Keep on coming! Hold your course, now! Hold it! Foxy, the signal! [Perami] Help me! Open the door! The door is jammed! [Fox] Push it! Push it, man! - We've got to unlock it! - [grunting] He's going away. He's not. He'll turn! He must turn. Alright, then, it's my fault. I'm sorry. All these hours you think "This fool of Perami." I know you think. But you think also the plane will see you. Well, I... I'm sorry. Oh, shut up! What does it matter now? Asleep? Yes, I gave him something to make him sleep. And a rest for you. I don't know how you manage it. He seems to snarl at you all the time. No. Not all the time. It's this cage he's in. He used to be so sweet-tempered, nothing bothered him. But now... poor John. Will he ever get better? Oh, there's always a chance. - For him? - For him. I don't know about for me. We got to get down there? Seems the only way. Come on, mister! No one can pass here. Let's break your rule, old-boy. You have to take a chance on it. [crashing] [thud] Listen. You better try and get him back. Yes, but how? Around the side of the glacier and back the way we came. - It's either that or leave him here. - What about you? I'll go on. It's a chance for the whole lot of us. Yeah. It pegged out on his own. It'll need the pair of us to get him back. We'll never make it. He's your brother. [Edward] Leave me here, James. - You go on. - What? Don't be an ass, Eddie. - I'll get you back. - How can you? I'm the one in trouble this time. Once I'm gone, you think you'll make it? I don't think you will either. So what's the difference? Well, good luck. [wind howling] [music playing] Switch off that thing or I'll break it! The pianissimo with open throat. Only I and Gilly in the whole world. Another 24 hours and Gilly will have it all to himself. Look! Look, there are three men coming! He's got through! Bill must have sent them up here! Foxy, he's got through! [Jimmy] Edward's hurt! Edward! - [Fox] Where's Haverton? - [Cormack] He went on. [Fox] Mary, take his other arm! - [James] Romer! - [Mary] I'm coming! There, how does it feel? More comfortable, thank you. You lay down, Mr. Marshall. [Jimmy] Now, take it easy, boy. His ribs broken? So they say. It only means he'll go before we do. I don't know. Busted ribs have something wicked. You got a broken rib once, didn't you? Against... Larry Mason? Did you see me fight Mason? I wasn't always like this. Larry Mason... I broke a rib that time. Yeah, but the Kid got the decision, he stopped that Mason, murdered him. Shut up. - What? - I said shut your big mouth. You don't like him, do you? Alright. I don't like fighting. That's all he talks about. Tell me, Cormack, how bad is Marshall? Bad. Did a terrible tumble. If that Jimmy hadn't been there... Busted ribs hurt something... [wind howling] [snoring] Anne? Anne? What is it? Put your face close to mine. Don't look like that, darling. Oh, John. Anne, I've been thinking. Everything is gonna be alright, now. And you mustn't be afraid any more. John, I love you so. I know, I've watched you. I've loved you for years, but I've snarled at you - and kept you away because-- - Darling, don't. Because I thought it wasn't any use. Not a man in a cage. Not a man dying. - You're not dying. - But now I have to tell you. I'm in love with you. And you mustn't be afraid any more. Please, please never stop loving me. Say that again. What you said just now, will you? What? "I love you so"? Yes. Now I'm easy. Now I can sleep. You must go to sleep again, too. Fix the mirror so that I can see you. Goodnight, darling. And bring tomorrow soon. [clattering] [whispers] Fox. Fox! Fox, come here, quickly! What's the matter? I've been thinking. There's something you've got to do - and do at once, or we'll all die. - What? You've got to do it! With this storm, they didn't get the message - from us by radio. - Our radio is dead. Yes, I know, but a battery is here on this cage of mine. What are you asking me to do? Murder you? Murder? Don't be so silly. If you don't do it, you'll kill the others and yourself and me. No. Fox, it isn't what you think, I... I can breathe for a while. You mean you can breathe if this thing stops working? Yes, sometimes, in my examinations I get out of it. The switch is on the floor, there. Try it and see. [Fox] This one? [click] Alright? Yes. Fine. [click] OK? Take the batteries and connect them to your radio. Go on, man! If I'm in any trouble, I'll call Anne, she'll know what to do. It's a chance I've got to take. It's not a chance. It's the answer. [click] Good. You sure you're alright? [John] Yes, fine, hurry. Goodnight, Anne. Goodnight. [buzzing] [tapping] George-Peter-one calling St. Denis control. Are you receiving me? Over. George-Peter-one calling St. Denis control. This is Fox. Now listen, here's our position. We're down on the Fellhof glacier, fifteen miles Northwest of St. Christoph. Wait, I'll give you the map routes. Mary! Mary! They heard! - How? - [Fox] They'll find us, now we'll be saved. I don't understand. They're sending a ski-plane to try and land here and transport planes and drop supplies. We must watch for them! Yeah, we better get the signal! My record! Be careful! What? - What is it? - Fox has fixed the radio. They're sending planes for us. How is he? You did this. He told me to take the batteries. He said he'd awaken you and you'd know what to do. I didn't look... I didn't think to look. [Fox] 0316 hours. Batteries from the iron lung connected to radio. 0717 hours, third day. Radio contact re-established. Anne. I hate this, but I've got to say it. What are we going to do? Anything you like. You see, all these people huddled here and... and getting jumpier all the time and... Oh, Anne, please, help me out. It sounds so brutal. The men can dig a grave in the snow. Perhaps if he stays here, it'll be easier for his parents. He won't mind. He's been lonely a long time. Mary, you tell the others. I'm gonna signal the aircraft. [wind blowing] [Anne] Say something. Somebody say something, some words. Does anybody know the service? Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. That's all I know. A poet of your country wrote up this. "Death, be not proud, though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so. For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me. Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, and dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell, and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well and better than thy stroke, why swell'st thou then? One short sleep past, we wake eternally and death shall be no more, Death, thou shalt die." [rumbling] [engine roaring] Watch yourself, my boy. Let's have a nice, clean landing. Open up, man! Open up! You're going to overshoot! [crashing] Can we get to him? No, he's had it. Proves one thing, they can't land up here. We'll have to find another place further down. And wait for the weather. What about that navigator boy? Didn't they get any message from him? No, because he hasn't got there. [Fox] 1116 hours. Radio contact with St. Denis control. Search planes report no trace of Haverton. To course over our position with containers of food and clothing. [engine roaring] [yells] They drop food and drink! It's wonderful! You see? You see? They're right here. Yes, I see. Coffee, soup... coffee! - Ski-boots. - Cigarettes. Yeah. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Of course, they wouldn't have thought of a cigar. Ah, brandy! I take this inside. Today we have breakfast. - Lipstick! How thoughtful of Malloy. - Look! I love everybody. Everybody. And specially you. They'll make a story out of this. Jimmy? Should I say I saved someone's life? [laughs] Yes, why not? You saved mine. [laughs] Don't be an idiot, darling. You'd have thought that girl'd been upset or something, wouldn't you? I suppose nurses haven't got feelings much. - Eh? - Why? You mean she ought to feel unhappy? Like you do when I'm having my block knocked off. - What are you talking about? - You. Mary. Mary, look! Look, down the mountain. Someone's coming. He's come back. Tell Foxy! He's come back! Bill! Oh, it's you, Bill! Oh. [speaks in French] Yes, but look here. What about St. Denis? Do they know where we are? [speaks in French] Do they...? [tries to speak French] ...We are? Oh, "we are." You tell him where we are. Shut up. Look here. [speaks in French] [in English] Saint Christoph, yes? I show you the map, you show me the way. [speaks in French] [speaks in French] Come and have a look at the map. [speaks in French] [conversation in French] Rescuer number one, he can't even talk English. [snoring] [John's voice] But now I have to tell you. I'm in love with you. And you are not to be afraid any more. And bring tomorrow soon. Well, we can't just sit here. Bill Haverton obviously hasn't gotten through. That means he's stuck out there somewhere and we gotta go out and find him. Lieutenant Albert knows some part of the way and I'm going. What about a couple more? Not me, I... I can't stand heights. I'll go. I'd like to. Thanks. And we thought signor Perami might fancy it. Me? Why me? Sit down, Sinatra. I'll go. No. Not you, you went last time. And I want you here to help Mary. I will not go, it's impossible. Make him go. Stupid ugly beast. Sitting here guzzling and playing your damned--! - That's enough! - Yes, take him! No! I don't go! Now will you go? If you don't get away from here, everybody will go crazy! That's exactly why I'm gonna take him with me, he'll be murdered if I don't. Yes. I will go. Mary an Miss Stephens can... Miss Stephens? Wake her up, Faber, will you? Where is she? She's gone away in the night. You knew and you didn't stop her? You let her go? Alone? She was alone here. I understand her very well. Miss Stephens! [yells] [F Search made for Anne Stephens without result. Faber found injured on glacier and brought back by Cormack. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How did you find him? I heard him yell. Nice job getting him back, you know? Well, which one is it? This one. Let me see that. Broken it? Alright. Feels like a sprain. Look. Frostbite. What? Frostbite? You crazy fool. I... I told you! You watch I don't tell you something. Captain Fox? I know you do not like me. And this boy Faber cannot travel now. But I will go. OK. If you want to. The rest of you, keep your ears open. If you hear a plane, send up a smoke signal. Burn something outside and be quick about it. [wind blowing] You're still thinking of Cpt. Haverton, aren't you? I used not to... I used to talk to him, at him. Think about myself. He was just somebody nice to have around. Now he's not around. I let him down. It's my fault he had to go all alone. He likes doing things alone. I wonder... I'm alone. I made my work my whole life. I'm growing old alone. It isn't enough. You have your brother. [chuckles] He's irresponsible and a half-wit. But it's true, I have him. You're fond of him? He's all I have to be fond of. And he depends on me. Tell me the truth. Do you think Bill will get through? And be safe? For both our sakes, I hope so. [wind blowing] [exhales] I have finished. You can't rest now. We're doing very well. Very well? Santa Maria. No. Come on, or I'll leave you. Hey! [echo] Hey! Listen. Hey! - Bill! - Haverton! Hey! Where is he? - Bill! - Haverton! Haverton! Foxy! I'm here! Well, I cannot go a step further. One by one, everybody's dying. Mister Barber, he died. Miss Stephen, she died. And now... who knows? Hey! Look out there! [speaks in French] Can we reach it? Can we reach it? [speaking in French] Many... hours walk. Can't they climb to us if they see? Too much cloud. Look, it's gone now. They might hear. Hey! [everyone shouting] They do not hear. Hey, you! You, grand piano with open throat. You shout! I do not shout. To scream like a hyena with my voice to spoil? You wanna stay up here all night and die here, you fool? To die here or to wreck my voice, what the difference is this? Or perhaps you want I should cut my throat? Well, we just have to wait here until they spot us. No. I will go alone over this mountain. [speaks French] You can't do it alone. I'm used to mountains. And I have to go on. Don't be a fool, Romer. Come back. I know he's crazy, but I hope he makes it. Come on, let's get you back to the plane. [wind blowing] There's a plane trying to land! He's trying to see us! Do you mind? [Joanna] Look what you've done, clumsy! He's hearing things. - Hey! - What's he doing? There's a-- He's trying to land! We must make a signal! [loud thuds] Look! It is a plane! [engine roaring] It's going behind the cloud. Quick! Jimmy, the petrol! Stop him! Hey! Don't be a fool! I've been wanting to do this for eight years! [grunts] Eight years and that's the first time I've enjoyed it! - Cormack! - Quick, the fire! We're on fire! You must get out of here! Let me help you. What about the others? Joanna! Outside, quick! Take these blankets. [explosion] All my lovely clothes ruined. Worse than that, the food's gone. I want to thank you and tell you I've never admired anyone so much. - Admired? - Yes. You got it good because you kept your head. Me? Yes, Jimmy. And I think you're quite beautiful. Well, now sock me. No. I rather liked it. [sighs] I'm afraid that's the best I can do for you. Is he OK? I shan't be needing that job, Edward, when I get back. I've got a plan. [Mary] We'll have to do something about that draft. OK, we'll fix it. Harry, come on inside. Don't talk to me. You've done it this time. Foxy. You'll have to tell Mary... - Tell her-- - What do you mean "tell her"? You'll tell her yourself. - Hey, you. - Hmm? Your fat will keep you warm. Look, there are people! There are people outside the hut! Hey! - Hello! - [speaks French] [shouting] All my life, I work for one thing, just one thing. [yells] - [coughs] - [speaks in French] [speaking in unison] They've heard us! Perami, that's certainly a voice. [grunts and coughs] My voice is gone. It's all coarse. It break. [sobs] [speaking in French] Romer... you're here. [man] He's very weak now. He arrived alone to tell us where you were. To tell you? You mean? Yes, we saw you through the glasses. You saw us? We were coming before we heard you call. Before I called? Before I--? [exhales] [man] The plane is here. You know, Albert says a ski-plane could land here. [speaks in French] So we send a party there to meet your people there. - When? - When it is light. When we go down to the village. Before... before I called. Before I called! [coughs] I lived my whole life for one thing. Now I give away. For what? For nothing. You look at this man. He's dead. [sighs] Joanna, darling, finish it. No. I'm so cold. I'm so cold. Hey, Mr. Marshall, is there any of that brandy left? Only enough for one, but don't let that worry you. It won't. They'll never find us now. We're forgotten, finished. Like the others. You can't say that, do you hear me? It's alright. They'll find us. I will keep until they do. - How nice. - [Mary] Mr. Gunn. Mister Gunn, wake up. Wake up! You'll have to keep him awake. You watch everybody, don't you? You're aware of Cormack, you're aware of James. Now this other fellow, Gunn. Somebody's got to do it. Enough people died already. I want to come through this. To go home to the ordinary things again. Work. - I know. - No, you don't. You don't understand. They think I've taken to the dullest cases. Embarrassing, you know? But it isn't true. I have the best cases. Fascinating. Human ingenuity in playing tricks. Stop it! Will you stop your blabber? Because you feel scared? You want everyone else to crack up. To make you feel better. Yeah. I know it. I'm not afraid of being dead, I'm just afraid of dying. No, he's alright. Let him sleep. He's had the brandy. You're not in love with me anymore. Were you ever in love with me? Is that the same thing? I didn't know you, Joanna. You think you'll even remember me? Perhaps not. But this is the end of something. They are here! Who's that? I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy! - Don't go away! - We take you to where the aero planes will land. Who got you? Tell me quickly! Five people, four of them are safe in St. Christoph. - And the other? - One has died of exposure. - Which one? - I do not know names, I'm told one has died. Then we come. And the others? Wake them all. Take us away from here. [indistinct conversations] Don't worry about him, Lilli. He will love you. Really? Eight years is a long time, you know? [shouting] [shouting continues] - It's quite alright, I can walk! - [speaking French] I'm not hurt! Oh, wait! Bill Haverton! Did he get back alright? Are you alright? [indistinct chattering] No, look after him first, he's badly injured. [shouting] Mister Faber, have you heard who got through? They don't know, they're waiting for the bus. Why don't they know? There was a storm between here and St. Christoph. Oh. It's bad for them too. Mister Barber's? Joanna, what happened? Well, I did my best to be brave. One has to. And if I did save someone's life, it was because... Oh, I'm so tired-- Joanna, you saved someone's life! You ask me, I'll tell you. Yes, you ask my fiancé, he'll tell you. Fiancé? What did she say you were? Well I-- Yes, yes. You two gentlemen must come to the hospital. Alright, I'm ready, but I'm not going with him. Let's get out of here. Come on. Thank you. I'm so glad that you've come through it all. [vehicle approaching] [shouting] Please, please. Joseph... Foxy! I'm glad to see you! You've brought them all down and it's all finished. You brought them all down. All that were alive. [Mary] Please! Please, let me get through! Mister Perami, we have postponed the opera for two days while you rest. You must find somewhere else this singer. Until I find wanted voice. You mind? I've got to get through! [Mary] Bill! - Bill, darling! - Mary! Oh, darling... I've been so afraid for you. Afraid of losing you. Are you hurt? I've been stupid. Don't ever leave me again! I told you to miss me. Don't ever leave me again. That's what I wanted to hear you say. That's everything. - Hold tight, darling. - Everything's alright again now that you're here. Come, mother. Come away... Those are the Romers. I knew. Can you find out where they live? Find that and let me know, will you? Why? What are you going to do? Something I've never done. Something I learned up there from other people. To do something for somebody else. Yes, we all have that feeling for a while, but it doesn't last, that's the trouble. You break your journey, it's a nine-days wonder, then everything goes on just the same. Not quite the same. Some of us will remember. You think so? [roaring]
