Could be a good one. - Hey, Nana wrote us, man. - Oh yeah? How's she doin'? - My dear boys, I hope all is going well with your lives. I would say you're moving right along and in the right directions. Life moves on, except now it is without our Phillip. Last Saturday night he went out to clean a pool, had a massive heart attack, and fell in. He never wanted to retire. He wanted to die a working man. Phil got his wish. We all should be so blessed. Well dear boys, get yourselves a hot dog or something, eat it thinking of me and I will feel your thanks. Love and hugs, Nana. - Uncle Phil died? - [Josh] He fell in a pool? - He was a pool cleaner. - I'll be able to like 3D print myself a new one [laughing] in like 3 years. - [Travis] I don't know if you'd want that, dude. I couldn't live without my dick. - I mean maybe, but being brain dead-- - Hold on, ask Andy. - Andy, would you rather have a lobotomy or get your dick cut off? - A lobotomy? - [Travis] See? That's what I said. - [Man] But y'all wouldn't know what to do with it. - You don't know what to do with it anyways. Can I bum a smoke? (phone ringing) - [Andy] Um, yeah. - Yeah! - Hello. Yes. Yes, ma'am. I will be there ready to go. - Say God bless. - Okay. Okay, God bless. - What the hell was that, dude? - That was the blood bank telling me I need to eat a full meal before my appointment on Tuesday. - Is it for good or for money? - For money. - [Andy] How much? - Like 30 bucks. We're mostly doing it to find out our blood type. Need the blood type to go to the sperm bank. - [Andy] How much is that? - Like $200 a sploosh. - Hey, that's long money, man. - [Both] Yeah! - You guys have the same blood type 'cause you're twins? - Same egg, bro. - You guys have the same penis? - [Both] Yes. - [Man] Hey, did you ever get that pizza you were wanting to get, man? - That was yesterday, man. - Oh yeah.

I tried to stay out of it and I think they think I'm a shitty painter. - Are you? - I'm all right. - What did you do all day? - Man, I hung around here, I took down a few wasps nests, I ate lunch, pizza. I did some writing, I beat off, that's about it. - Yeah, what'd you do last night? - Man, I went to see about this chick. - [Andy] Which one? - The one I met at the gas station. - [Andy] How was that? - Weird.

I'm gonna go to the bar. You want to go? - I got 20 bucks. - [Travis] Nice. Should we ask your brother? - No. (light banjo music) No. - [Travis] All right! - Let's go! -Man, if I could do it all over again, I think I'd be an OBGYN. - Why? - Just think about it, dude. - Like that's an actual job and you're bringing life into this world every day. You're like a safecracker. - I mean, you could still do that. - Nah, it's too late. (dogs barking) - Please don't get a dog. - Why? - Please. You don't need one. - Yes I do. They'll love me unconditionally. It won't put earplugs in its ears, dude. - Yeah, but you can't take care of yourself. How are you going to take care of a dog? - Oh, good one. - I'm just saying.

Like what do you write? - You know, poetry, short stories, I'm also working on a novel. - [Rose] No shit! - What are you doing for money? - I'm just trying to get it together. Trying to look for work actually. Hey, is that fence dude looking for people because I could-- - No, no, but I did just get out of this medical research facility for the last nine days. Remember how broke I was? Now I'm flush. - How much did you make? - Five grand. - What? - Yeah, Medico baby. - How do you do it? - Basically, you have to be like a lab rat. You take pills, get your blood drawn, just sit in this facility for days and days. - But you just-- - Just show up. Every morning, 10 a.m. They do introductions. - Wow, damn. - [Remy] You know anybody renting a room? - Uh, no.

You're selling me the RV for 15 and giving me six, call it a day. - I'm not selling you the fucking RV, Ben. - It doesn't even run! - Yes it does! - It doesn't. - It will! Same difference, all right. - "Same difference, all right!" - Fuck you, man. - It doesn't run. - I have to put in a new carburetor and fix the battery. - Yeah, and I gotta do it for you. - Oh, wow! Who cares! - All right, you sell me the RV for two grand, I erase your debt, it's a sick deal. I sell it to a guy on a deer lease, or I rent it to you, you live back there. - [Andy] No! No fucking way! - Why not? - It's the only way I'm gonna get the fuck out of here and onto everything else I'm ever supposed to do! - I'd love to know what you've got to do. What you think you got to do out there. I give you a sweet place to live for 385 bucks a month, all bills paid, okay? I let you keep your little camper back there on the land, I don't charge you for it, you're my brother, it's fine. You eat my food, all the time, I know you do it, I buy more because of you, you little bastard. I keep fucking toiletries for you. You and your little buddy come in at night, you take my weed, smoke it. I know you do it, you think I don't notice, I notice! - Yeah, I'm sure you do. - What does that mean? What, like I'm a bad guy? I love that. I'm the bad guy! - You're not a bad guy. - That's just human beings, man. You do, you do, you do and what do they do? They resent you. - I'm just sick of owing you this fucking money, man. - What do you want, man? You want to be like your little buddy back there, collecting unemployment for being a waiter for two years? - No, that's not what I want. - Dad will slap the shit out of you. - That's not what I want. - [Ben] I hope not, man. I didn't set you up here for that. - And I'm not lazy. That's why I'm going to this place. Alright, so I can pay you back and finally get going so I can figure my shit out. (door opening) - Beer? - I can't. - [Travis] Why not? - I gotta go in tomorrow and they said no food or drink beforehand. - [Travis] Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching! - The mediocrity with you is so thick. it...it baffles me. - [Travis] You don't mean that, dude. - Also, that Remy dude is gonna stay here while I'm gone. - What? For how much? - $250 to stay in the RV - that's strong money, man. - Make it $325, he can stay in here. - Alright. - What? I was gonna try and stay in the house. - You're an outside guy, man.

Michael Schlosser. - Hey, baby. - What are you doing here? - [Remy] My follow-up blood draw and my check - [Andy] Nice. - Yeah, that's that long money. What are you doing here? - Checking in. - Want me to show you around? - Are you allowed? - They love me in here. Denise, I'm gonna give my little friend here the nickel tour. - All right, baby. - All right, come on! (light, curious, disembodied music) - This is the cafeteria. Last time, they served this like barbecue rib sandwich thing three nights in a row. People were fucking pissed. - This is the movie room. They play some pretty decent stuff sometimes, usually comedies. Nothing too exciting. - You can't watch any porn but it's better than nothing. This last time, there was a guy studying for the GRE. He was taking exams the entire time. He was pretty cool. - I suggest you get a top bunk. People fart a lot in here, especially at night. I think it's like the meds and shit. They don't like you doing too much physical activity, but I like to do some push-ups and sit-ups just to keep it all together. Watch your shit. Some of these dudes are pre-release from prison, some of these dudes are straight up veterans, they've been doing this shit since 'Nam, like for the government. You're not trying to make any friends in here, man. It's pretty much bottom of the barrel here. (breathing deeply) But you'll be fine! Come on. - And this is the day room slash rec room, you can hang out and play games and shit. There's this pool table, but it's kinda fucked and the sticks suck. But... this, this is the window. It's good to get your sun. - [Andy] Can you go outside at all? Ever? - [Remy] No. Never. (tone chiming) And that, that is the tone of time. That is your God. It's probably your first blood draw, we should see about it. Can't be late. Don't ever be late. - [Man] Hey, what's for lunch? - [2nd Man] Yeah, when are we eating, dammit? I'm starving! - This is it, man. I'm outta here. - Thanks, man. - Good luck, baby. Hey remember, just do your own time. (tone chiming) - Oooh. - You okay? - [Nurse] One more. - Treetop. - Andy. - [Chester] Is that fish? I can't eat fish. - Why not? - 'Cause they're gross. I don't want to eat a fish, man. - You tellin me you're not gonna eat that? - No, no way. - Let me get that then. - Yeah. - All right. - Thank you. (humming) - You're missing out, this is good. - Oh, I'm sure I am. - Hey. - So I know y'all did not just eat this man's fish? - [Both] Mm-mm. - [Ray] Nope. - No. - [Ray] Wrong table. [snickering] - Okay people, let's listen up. I bet we're glad to have finally eaten. We were hungry? - Yeah, mm-hmm. - Well good. I heard there was an incident with the fish. I'm not naming names, but if anything like that would happen again, strikes will definitely be given. There is to be no sharing of food. Do we understand? - [All] Yeah. - We're here together for awhile so let's all get comfortable and do our work and respect each other and the process. In your packets, you will find all the known side effects of the drug and you must sign that you understand them completely. It's an experimental medication for syphilis. The study is to test how the healthy body responds to the drug. Please read your packets thoroughly and sign. If you are late for any meals, you will be docked. If you are late for any doses, you will be docked. If you are late for any blood draws or ECGs, you will be docked pay and given a strike. Three strikes and you're out, so watch your time, people. If for any reason you exit the study within its duration, you will forego the $2,500 completion bonus, you will however retain your day rate for all days completed. Your first dose will be in half an hour, do not be late. Thank you, people. (dreamy jazz music) - Open your mouth. Lift your tongue. Now, pull your cheeks like this. - Good boy. - Hey, anybody ever tell you you look like the guy from the show Scrubs? - No. - Well you do. Are you him? - Nope. (phone vibrating) (light rock music) - [Remy] Do you have a beard trimmer? I gotta get rid of this hospital beard. - [Ben] I do. - [Remy] Can I use it? - You can. But I will tell you that I do use it to shave my pubes. So that's up to you. - I don't even have one. - [Remy] You got a scissor? - [Travis] Yo, we're out of coffee filters, man! - Use some toilet paper. - We don't have any of that either, man. We've been using the coffee filters. And I bought both of those things last time. - All right, I'll go, dude. - [Remy] I'll grab them, don't worry. You want to hit this? - [Travis] All right. - [Ben] What are you so dressed up for? - About to go on a date with this chick I met on Craigslist. - [Ben] Oh yeah? - Oh yeah! - [Josh] Is she a babe? - Could be, man. She's got like piercings and tattoos and shit and I'm into it. - [Josh] Nice. - Maybe I'll marry this one. (all laughing) - [Remy] Man, I really wish you didn't tell me about the beard trimmer. - [Ben] Why not? - Well, 'cause I knew it, we knew it, and if we hadn't talked about it, I would have used it. - Well you can use my brother's, man, we don't have to talk about his. - I just did! (all laughing) (tone chiming) - [Woman] Morning, gentlemen. (toilet flushing) (gulping) - [Ray] No man at home. If you know, it's okay. You can always come snuggle up next to Ray. (snoring) - [Nurse Don] You're late. - Yeah. - [Don] What's your number? - B-7134. (keyboard clicking) (cats meowing) - Yo Scrubs, you want to shoot one? - Nah man, I'm not that good. - Jesus ain't that good. - Maybe later, all right? - Yeah, all right. You trying to hustle me Scrubs. - I'll play you! - Okay everyone, marathon blood draw starting in 15 minutes. It'll take about three hours. Do not be late. (pool balls clattering) (tone chiming) (group chattering) - So, what's your blood type? - I'm A positive. - I'm Andy. - I'm Misty. What's your blood type? - Uh, A minus, I think. - [Nurse] You're A positive. (group chattering) (dreamy jazz music) (insect buzzing) - You want me to talk to her? - No, no. - She seems very nice. - Yeah. - Alright, would you guys rather have a lobotomy or get your dicks cut off? (all laughing) - Shit, I'd rather blow my fucking head off than get my dick cut off by some asshole. Are you crazy? - Would I have a super evolved brain? - Without a dick? - Yeah, yeah probably. - I need to think about that, man. I need to think about that, that's heavy. - You're a weird guy, Scrubs. (all laughing) (choking) (gagging and choking) (whistle blowing) - Hey, that guy probably had syphilis, man! (laughing) (light guitar music) (muttering prayer) - Amen. - Hey. Can I sit with you? - Okay. - Okay. - So do you come here often? - No, this is my first time. You? - Yeah, mine too. I came for the food. I'm staying for the money. - Me too. - Do you think this is the guy from yesterday? - That's not funny. - [Andy] I'm not kidding. He just disappeared and... - Are you a vegetarian? - No. - Well, apparently our bloodline is really old and our people only ate like nuts and berries and fruit and stuff, so we don't have the proper digestive enzymes to, you know, digest meat. - We're kinda like old souls then? - Sure. - So I've been eating the wrong food every day of my life? - Are you tired a lot? - Yeah. - Feel weighed down all the time? - Like I have the weight of the world on me. - Do you sweat a lot when you eat meat? - Yes, meat sweats! I get em! - There you go. This is disgusting. - So why are you in here? - For the money? - I mean you're-- - What? Pretty? So? - I just mean any guy would be really lucky to take care of you. - Fuck that! - Hey, come on, that's not what I meant. - That's why I'm in this fucking place. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (vomiting) (tone chiming) - You know, there's a part of me that still says I should go back and get my PHD. Ya know? But I don't know. With the healthcare game so volatile right now I don't know if it makes sense. I mean, look at this place. And then there's part of me again that wants to go back and be a golf pro. You know, say I tried it and I did it. (laughing) - Yeah, golf's pretty volatile stuff. (imitating crowd cheering) (laughing) - What's up? - [Andy] I just had a bad dream. - [Misty] What happened? - [Andy] Come on. Nobody ever really wants to hear other people's dreams. - I do. I love dreams. (tone chiming) - Some other time. (glass squeaking) - So what do you do? - About what? - Everything? Work, money, work. - You're looking at it now. - Ugh. (chuckling) - [Andy] So what do you do? - [Misty] About what? - [Andy] Money, you know, all of it? - [Misty] Well, I don't want to do any of the things that I used to do for money. What? I was a bartender. And I did...vfoot stuff. - Okay... What is that like? What does that entail? - Like guys would get a hotel room or invite me over to their house and they'd play with my feet or take pictures of my feet. - That's weird. - Yeah. - And sometimes they would bring these toys or they'd build model towns and bake cakes and shit and have me walk all over them and destroy them and they'd videotape it. - How'd you know you wouldn't get like hurt though? - It was through a service. And anyway, my ex would drive me there and he'd wait for me and then he'd take me home. - Like a pimp? - No. - And he didn't care? - No, in fact he preferred it to me bartending. That drove him crazy. - Well, he sounds like a great guy. (sighing) - [Misty] Yeah. - Well what do you want to do? - Well, I write a lot. And I know everybody says that, but I actually do. And I think I'm pretty good. And I want to travel. A lot. And I know everybody says that too. What? - It's just everybody does say that. "I want to travel. I want to travel." I feel like everybody just does the same shit. You know, like they go backpacking through Europe or they travel to Latin America and then they come back and think they're Latin people or something. You know? Or they cheat and carry out these affairs just to feel more interesting. Cause they don't do anything real at all. They fuck around and they get drunk or they do too many drugs. Or they try to make a lot of money and accumulate wealth like a bunch of dumb idiots. And they do it because they're not good at anything. So they go on doing these interesting things and telling everybody about them as though people actually care cause they want people to know about the things they do more than they care about actually doing them. And it's all the same. It's just so...desperate, always, with people. They... (sighing) It's just something I've been thinking about in here and shit. - You're crazy for thinking that anything you do is gonna be some novel thing. It's just not like that. - People are alive, Andy, and they have to do things that they think they should do. If you don't, you're a dead person. And that sucks. (tone chiming) - I want a double-meat, double-cheese Whopper, man, fuck! - Hell yeah, with fries? - Large fries! - And a shake! - I wish I had a pussy to eat right now! - That's breakfast, lunch, and dinner bro! - After this shit man, I'm gonna eat all the fucking pussy in the world. Shit, with this kinda money. Think about it. - [Nurse] Okay, lights out. Goodnight gentlemen. - [Sam] Goodnight. (door closing) - [Domingo] Dios te salve, Maria, llena eres de gracia el Señor es contigo. Bendita tú eres-- (Ray farting) - [Ray] Night Scrubs. - [Andy] I write too, you know. - Do you? I haven't seen you write the entire time you've been in here. - Yeah, well, I got a lot going on in here. - You should write me something. - What? Now? - Yeah. - Nah... - Write me a picture. - A picture? - A picture of anything. Whatever you want. - [Andy] A picture. - Read it. - What? - Yeah. - I'm gonna go home and draw a picture of two trains. One's gonna have pretty eyes. That one's gonna be you. The other is gonna be blue. That one's gonna be me. (tone sounding) (light rock music) (vomiting) (machine beeping) (machine beeping faster) - Let's go again. - Alright. - I called winner! - Nah, we said best two out of three. - [Ray] Wake up, man. Always sleepin'... - I just wanna smoke a fat bowl and eat tons of shit. You know what I mean? This fuckin' sucks, wake me when it's bedtime. - It ain't so bad, man. - [Ray] Yo Scrubs, you want winner? Yo Scrubs! - What? - You want winner? - Nah, I'm good. - Oh, okay Scrubs, okay, I see how it is. - Man, I will play you! (soft, orchestral piano music) (laughing while crying) (music growing louder and more dramatic) (toilet flushing) (spitting) - Well look who's late to the party. That's a strike. (water running) - Get on the bed. - [Nurse] Shirt off. - Now, lay down. - I told my mama to go get the gun. She was just lying there on the ground next to him. Rocking back and forth, back and forth, all shocked, crying in the grass. Couldn't do nothing. So I had to strangle him to death, 'til he stopped his moving. While my mama she just cried and cried. - Oh my God. - And I still miss that dang cat. Five, Jimmy. - I think the best part is, I come from a small town called Wynot. It's W-Y-N-O-T, if you ever- - Goodnight. - Hey, can I walk you? (light piano music) - Yeah. - Shall we? - Yeah. - Meet me in the movie room at twenty-four hundred. - Goodnight. (snoring) (distant chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) - I'm scared. - I think we'll be okay. I've been thinking a lot lately about being human. - It's a difficult way to live. - Yeah, and about how there really isn't any original thing you can do. Yeah, okay, people fall in love, people travel. Or they can live to some other kind of standard, like they could become a Buddhist monk or something, but even that's been done to death. That's why, really all there is to do, is to try and create. And I don't mean make babies, or whatever, everybody does that too. I mean, I mean, you have to try and make good work. Try and make something that's your own. - Personally. - Yeah, your own. Your experiences. You just gotta make sure your having the right experiences. - Movie time is over. Oh, it's Nurse Don. Is he gonna give us strikes? Yeah, he is. Strike, strike. Come on. One more and you're both out of here, right? - Hey, it's my fault. - I'm sure it is. Goodnight. Come on, Romeo. (soft rock music) (rock music playing from a stereo) (laughing) - So I was thinking... - You were thinking? - [Woman] We could... (music slowly building) (music drowning out all other sounds) (crying) - What the fuck, man! Damnit! (door slamming) (music stops) (crying) - It's okay, big guy. (tone chiming) - [Nurse] Good morning, gentleman. - They want our blood again. - Okay. I'll be right out. (Misty sighing) - That's some good shit, homey. Shit. Hey, you don't want no part of this, Scrubs. (coughing) - Hey guys! (chuckling) What do we have going on here? - Bitchass. - It's tropical punch! (chuckling) And I'm pretty sure this is your last strike, huh, guy? - Hey, man, chill. He ain't even hit the motherfucker, all right? He didn't even hit the motherfucker, all right? He was just looking at it. He ain't never seen one before. - Yeah, I ain't ever seen one before. - Right, right. You expect me to believe that? That's all three of you getting strikes. - Hey fool, I said he didn't hit the motherfucker. Alright? Look, I'll take the strike, it's mine. You smelling my shit? - Yeah, I smell it. And you're getting two strikes for this! - That's fine by me! - Thanks man. - That sucks. It was like 80 bucks! - [Andy] Wanna go to the movies again or what? - Okay. (soft orchestral music) (tone chiming) (music crescendos) (music fading) - I'm not... - What? - Anything. Don't. - [Nurse] Hold that there, I'll be right back. Okay, one more. Huh...Two more. (coughing) - That's really nice. - Thank you. It's come a long way. It's... - Totally. - I do them all over the country. It's a landscape. I do ones outside too. I do all kinds. - That's nice. (tone chiming) (melancholy piano music) (coughing) - Go to her. - Hey, fuck that! Hey, man, you look like shit. - I feel like shit, man! It's this fuckin' medicine and the air in here, man. I can't fuckin' breathe it anymore. I need to go outside or something, man. - Well listen, you can't act sick in here. If the screws find out, they gonna kick you out of the program and you're gonna lose that money you been working so hard for. You smellin' my shit? - What do I do? - Keep your fuckin' mouth closed. Put on a good face. Go get cleaned up. Look we got one day left in this shit and that's it. So eat your fucking breakfast, man. (dreamy jazz music) (coughing) (coughing) - Drink it all. Make sure you get some more. (coughing) - Ladies and gentlemen, it is almost time for your final dose. You did it. Congratulations. (all clapping) - Ain't my fault your wife went and got pregnant. I'm going to Myrtle. The Masters, baby! (coughing) (door closing) (coughing) (door opening) (sniffing) (camera clicking) (vomiting and coughing) - The hell are you doing in here? You're sick, man. I'm tellin'. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. I saw you, you fuckin perv. - Saw what? - What you just did. In here. - Who cares? - I care. - Bro. - Don't you dare fucking 'bro' me man, or else. - Excuse me? Or else what? - Or else this isn't gonna look to pretty for you. And this whole weird place. I don't think it needs any bad light shining on it, do you? - What do you want? - Erase all our strikes. Mine, hers, and all the guys. And see to it that none of our wages get docked at all.

Thanks, see ya! - [Misty] Can I please come in? - [Andy] No! - [Misty] Why not? - Cause I don't need the emotional overhead of all of that right now. - Of what? - Of you, all right? Of all of this. I need me and this RV. That's it. And maybe a dog that we find somewhere along the way to love us. - Andy. - Of all the beds you could have ended up in in this town, you had to end up in mine. - Look, I'm just glad that I found you. Aren't you? - Look, I went back with my boyfriend, my ex-boyfriend, and it was a huge mistake, okay? So I fled. And then I met him out and we just started talking and he was being really nice and I was exhausted. So yes, I went home with him. I did. I did that. Look, I'm leaving tomorrow. Where are you going? - I don't know. Anywhere that's not fucking here. - Can I please come in? I won't hurt you or anything. - Yeah, okay, Misty. Oh wait. That's not your real name. You gave me some fake stripper name or something like the whole thing was a fake thing for you. - No, no, no it wasn't. It was real. That's why. That's why I got scared. And because I didn't want to let you down. - I'm Sarah. - Sarah? - Yeah, Sarah. What? What? That doesn't fit your whole weird idealization of me? You can't do that. - Do what? - Idealize me like that. Like you did. - I can't help it. - Well, it isn't fair. It's like I'm this sacred, virgin lovething, or something, that I'm not. I will never live up to it, Andy, cause I'm just a person, like you, who likes you. And I loved your poem, so much. And your blood. And, not like this matters, because I'm not your girlfriend and you don't have any claim over me or anything, but nothing happened with him. - What? - He just cried a lot and-- and I cried too. And we -- I don't know, we just cried together until we fell asleep. And so what if I fucked him? I've fucked a lot of guys! (sighing) Can I please come in? - What's the point? - 'Cause I heard about this thing and we should go do it, together. - What thing? - It's a sleep study in Paris. And they just want to monitor our dreams. And our brain activity. (laughing) It's 10 grand! Per person. For two weeks. And they fly you out there and you could stay up to like a month before they fly you back. And they want couples. And I don't know, maybe it will work between us, maybe it won't, but at least we'll get to see about each other and see some of the world and it'll be an adventure. We just gotta get to Florida. (laughing) I like you. And I want to go on an adventure with you. So what do you say? Can I come in? Or what? (sighing) - What's that? My money? - Yeah. - [Ben] Keep it. - Really? - Ah, gimme half. - Really? - No, man. Definitely not. It's the real world. Gimme my money. And what's up with her car over there? Is it going to sit there the rest of my life or what? - [Andy] I don't know. - [Ben] I'll give ya $250 for it. - What do you think? - About what? - About the car? I'll give you three for it. - Three what? - $300. - For my car? - [Ben] Yeah. - It's all yours, man. - Make it four and we'll call it a day. - Deal. Here. For some food and gas and stuff for you and her, you're gonna need it. - Really? - Yeah. 'Cause you came through on that too. And I like ya. - [Andy] I love you too, man. - You're a good boy. She seems all right. Be careful. - [Andy] Alright. - Later, man. - [Andy] Later. - Don't be takin any wooden nickels out there while you're sellin' your soul. - I won't. - [Travis] Oooh, yeah. - [Both] Ah. - [Andy] God. Y'all be good, alright? - We will. (laughing) - Bye guys. - [Ben] Hang on, Andy. (sighing deeply) Hey man, you let me know when you get wherever the hell you're going, alright? - I will, man. Later. - [All] Later. (laughing) (car sputtering) (car starting) (Sarah laughing) (sighing) - Here we go. (horn honking) (Sarah laughing) (upbeat rock music)
