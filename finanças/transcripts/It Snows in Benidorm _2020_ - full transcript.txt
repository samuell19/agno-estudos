Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I have very few certainties. But there is something I'm sure about. Neither the weather nor people can be trusted. She, our daughter, was working in a call centre, and the company closed it down. Relocation, they call it. Now, if your refrigerator breaks down, you have to call someone in Bangalore. We came from Bangalore all those years ago. Her husband has been unemployed for two years and the three have moved in with us. The three. The two of them and their six-month-old baby. If we are evicted, you'll be leaving two families on the street, Mr Riordan. You don't know how sorry I am, Mr... We have been paying this mortgage for the last 25 years. - Yes. - 25. And how often have I not paid an instalment? - Not once. - Not once. We have gone without vacations, we have not squandered our money, we have not lived beyond our possibilities, because paying a debt is sacred for me. And you, of all people, you know that. - You know that. - I... I do. Mr And Mrs Shah, I-I-I know that, I'm well aware of that. And that is why we've been flexible, you see. We understand a few missed payments in these times that we're living in, but, Mr and Mrs Shah, it's been six months. Six months in which we have been living with Â£925. Yes, Mrs Shah, I-I understand that. Mr Shah, well, I understand that. But your contract clearly states... But... but there must be something... There must be something that you can do, Mr Riordan. Whatever is necessary. Please tell me, but we cannot go out on the streets now, please. I personally would love to do so... If I have to touch your feet, I will do that. - Mr Shah, no, no, please. - Yes. No. No. - No, Mr Shah. - No, but don't evict us, please. Don't do that. Think of the baby. - Please, no, no, look. - No, no. I'm asking you now, please sit down, Mr Shah, and we'll do some... we'll reassess, we'll have a look. - Mrs Shah, ask him, please. - No, no. No, please. No. A mortgage extension for the Indians? Beautiful. - They were on their knees. - Oh. And where is it written that getting on your knees grants you special client privileges, Peter? - They were desperate. - Yeah? Who isn't? What is the bank, a good Samaritans' helpline now? I'm sorry, but it was the only solution I could think of. The solution is eviction. No, no, no, refinancing the Shahs' debt means that they don't lose their home and we are guaranteed another 10 years' payments. Yeah, payments that they'll never be able to make. Good thinking there, Peter. No, they're just... They're just going through a bad patch. They'll come through it. The Shahs are decent, conscientious people. They've been exemplary customers all the time I've been at this branch. Yes, well, no-one is exemplary forever. That is very obvious. That will be all, Peter. Alright. Thank you. PETELeuchars isn't a bad sort. He likes teaching lessons and overuses the word 'obvious'. I suppose he can't understand why unambitious people like me continue working here, a most unsuitable place for us. Or that we continue existing at all. No, he's not a bad sort. But he did tell me one day that it's mathematically impossible that six million people died in the Holocaust. "Mathematically impossible" said by a man who can't even add two simple figures together without a calculator, it sounds really convincing. - Oh. Oh. - You alright there? I'm trying to be independent! Alright. Sorry. I started to get interested in the weather when I was very young. I have no explanation. My brother and I grew up in a home with parents who were too busy destroying each other to pay attention to what we did in our free time. I chose meteorological phenomena as a hobby. My brother didn't really choose anything. The winds, generated out at sea, sweep inland across the continents. The sun beating down on tropical waters powers the weather systems of the globe. Moisture evaporates from the warming ocean and rises... Here, talking about the weather is a kind of code we've developed to help us overcome social inhibitions. But for me, the weather is a way to feel that there's something happening. And if there isn't, there's always a promise. Uh, good morning, Mr Leuchars. When you get a moment, please tell me what you want... - What? - ..to do with the credit line? Um, later. Peter, later. I'm busy. Alright. Fair enough. Prawn cracker. But without any prior warning, a letter firing me... No, we're not letting you go. It's early retirement. "We"? - Yes. - We? "We"? I thought we were "we". What? What? Yes, we, the company, we, we want to reward you for your loyalty and... and good work. Well, this isn't a reward. How can you say that? I would love it. You'll be getting a most handsome pension. But I can still work! Who wants to work when you can do what you want? What I want? Of course. Enjoy life, Peter. That's what we all want. What I want? Right. Yes! What... what I want is this. Yes? No farewell party, please. A party? No-one was thinking of holding one. Today, someone younger will be sitting in my chair. I'd like to have a quiet word in his ear and say, "One day, "you might regret having devoted your life "to offering money to people who don't need it "and refusing it to those who do." I won't miss that. Your call cannot be taken at the moment, so please leave your message after the tone. Hey! It seems... It seems like I'm finally gonna see you. Yeah. I'm gonna... I'm gonna dig those Spanish course tapes that you... that you gave me. Dig them out, yeah. Um, actually, time has gone, but I don't know where I put them, I don't think. Should be able to find them. Um... Uh... Actually, I'm a bit nervous. Uh... you know, it's been a long time since I travelled. I'm... I don't know... I don't know if I still know how to do it, you know? Packing bags, suitcases and all that sort of stuff. It mustn't be that difficult, though, eh? Um... Oh, yeah, they even got wheels on them nowadays. Ha ha! Huh. Alright, then. Well, look, um, yeah, I'll let you know about, uh, flights and arrivals and all that, uh, stuff. Uh... I want to see your ugly face, brother. No, I-I really do. Uh... Alright. Ta-ra. Huh. Departure of flight Vueling Airlines 2612... Hello, uh, Daniel, uh, it's me. It's, uh... it's Peter again. Yeah, but, um... Look, I've been... I've been waiting over an hour now. Um, did you get the date wrong or something? Uh... well, I'll, uh... I'll stick around for a bit longer, then I'll probably make me... ...make me way to your place, alright? Call me, obviously, anyway, uh, when you get this. 'Bye. Hi, Daniel, uh, uh, hello, uh, brother. Um... Well, yeah. I'm just wondering if you got held up or something, you know. Maybe you're out or range or your phone's not working or something like that. I'm here. I'm... I'm in by a big... ...waiting by a big sort of, uh, indoor garden type of thing. Obviously, give us a call or text me when you get this or something. Let me know what you're doing. Alright. Cheers... cheers, bro. Christ! Fuckin' hell. Hello. Your call cannot be taken at the moment. Ahhh. How much is that, please? A... a... hundred, please. - A hundred? - Yes. Sir. Here you are. Sorry? The ride from the airport has a set price. The taxi driver shouldn't have charged you so much. Oh, right. Uh, uh, thank you. That's very kind of you. You are welcome. Enjoy Benidorm. 'Bye! Uh, yes. So-sorry. I-I don't speak Spanish. Can I help you? Uh, yeah. Um, my-my brother has invited me. Uh, his name is Daniel. Daniel Riordan? Hmm. Yeah, well... well, he knows I'm arriving today. Uh, he arranged to meet me at the airport, but-but he didn't show up. Um... do you want to see some ID? I've got my passport here. It's OK. Um, give me a moment. Yeah. Hey. Um, your brother has gone away. But he mentioned that you were coming. Mm-hm. Did he say when he'd be back? No-one has seen him since... Saturday, maybe. But that's three days ago! Well, Mr Riordan comes and goes all the time. I think he has business in Africa. S... Since when? Africa? It's what Lucy says. She cleans his apartment. She knows him well. But, um, he'd... he'd... he'd have said... You know, I don't... It's very strange, this. He'd have definitely said something to me. Um... - Um... - Come with me. No, he'd... he'd have said something, though. I mean... Follow me. Yeah, yeah. Sure. - Sir, this way. - Yeah. Are you gonna stay for a long time? Uh, a... a couple of weeks, I think. OK. Uh... thank you. Enjoy. Do you mind if I smoke? What? Hello. Daniel didn't like it. By the way, you drool when you sleep. Has anyone ever told you? Oh... Uh... Do I? Uh... Um, sorry. How... How did you get in? Where is Daniel? I-I have no idea. The, uh... the doorman said that he's... he's... ...had business in Africa. Africa? - Yeah. - Really? The whole continent? Well, that's what he... That's what he told me. I don't know. Um... I'm sorry, but, um, who-who are you? Alex. Uh, I'm Peter. Oh. Shoes. Daniel has one just like that. Oh, yeah! Uh, well, our father, he... he... he gave us one each just... just before he died. It was like he knew his time had come, you know. Was he a watchmaker? No, he just wasn't very original. I work in your brother's club. - I'm the manager. - What? And he hasn't been by in quite a few days and people haven't been paid. So... I just came by to see if he's alright. Daniel has a club? Where the hell have you come from? Uh... Did he leave phone numbers? - Addresses? - Nothing. - Any... - No. Any kind of document? Why would he leave any documents? Uh... If you speak to your brother, you tell him people are a little angry. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. Uh, wait a minute! Um... Uh... ...what...what's the name of the club? Benidorm, Club Benidorm. Your brother was just as original as your father. Right. What kind of man has a neon sign with his name on it? Whoo! Whoo! Cocaine? Cocaine? Viagra? - Uh, no, no, no, thanks. - OK. Oh. Hello. Your call cannot be taken at the moment. So please leave your message after the tone. Sorry. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Uh... Excuse me. Uh, do you speak English? Yeah. Is it, uh, possible to... to visit the artists? Yeah. The dressing rooms are over there. Right, so... so it's allowed? They won't be annoyed or anything? Go. Don't be shy. Alright. Uh, thanks. Sorry. Sorry, love. Gigi, have you found my scarf? I can't find my scarf! No idea. I put it here! I can't find it! Come in! Hi, Peter. Uh... Sorry. Uh... Whoo! Whoo! - Do you want to get married? - No! Come on. You'll be fine, darling. Ohh! Sorry. Uh, do you have to do that now? Uh, excuse me. Uh, excuse... Hello. It's, uh, uh, Lucy, is that right? - Yes. - Yeah, um... So, it-it isn't necessary to-to vacuum. Um... Um... No... no English? No... no English. I've got a... - Hangover. - Yeah. Hango... No. No, no, hangover. No. It's a headache. Um, so, sorry, if you... if you have to clean, do that, can you, uh, clean without... Tea? T... Tea? - Tea. - Oh, cup of tea. Yeah, oh, lovely. Yeah. Well, thanks very much. Oh, uh... - Tea. - Tea. Yeah, thanks. Oh, uh, thank you. Uh... uh... It's, uh... interesting. Fuck! Shit. Uh, is it a police station? Yeah. Yes, it is. - Is it OK to... - Yeah, you can go. Thank you. Uh... Now, uh, my brother's phone. Hmm? Oh, it's you! Hello. Hello. Um... Uh, have a seat, please. Uh, thank you. I... I didn't know you... ...you're a, you know... - So, what can I do for you? - Uh, well... Who told you that your brother had gone abroad? Well, it was the, uh, the doorman, like a caretaker at his building. Mm-hm. But it's very odd, you see, that he... that he, uh, didn't say anything or... or leave a message. And the fact that we... we were meeting, you know, we hadn't seen each other for a long time, well, it was... it was ages, in fact, you know, it was like... a special event. It's just not normal that he... that he would disappear without saying anything. I understand your concern, but that you found his phone under the bed isn't sufficient indication that we're dealing with a disappearance. Maybe we should wait a few more days before sounding the alarms, hmm? Yeah, uh, they say, don't they, that hundreds of people, like, disappear every year in... in Benidorm? Well, you know, well, I saw that on a documentary on Channel 4 back home. And do you believe everything you see on television? No. No. Uh, let's see. You say that you and your brother haven't seen each other in a long time. I mean, you're not very close. Isn't it possible that your brother changed his mind? No! I... don't see why. Look, we are close, but, you know, the fact we haven't seen each other isn't anything to do with any, like, falling-out we've had or anything like that. No, it's just... Well, it's just life. "So many people are shut up tight "inside themselves like boxes, "yet they could open up, "unfolding quite wonderfully, "if only you were interested in them." Uh, very nice. Yeah. Uh... Uh, can we get back to my brother? Oh, yes. Let's get back to your brother. Um, when was the last time you saw him? It was about, uh, 10, 12 years ago. Uff! People change. - I don't. - But maybe your brother does. Officer, my brother would never stand me up. If you don't expect anything from anybody, you'll never be disappointed. - That's what you say. - No. I don't say it. It's by Sylvia Plath. Oh, well, alright, well, look, we're not close in a... in a conventional sense, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um... Mr...? - Riordan. - R-Rirden? - Ri... Riordan. - Ri-ordan. - Riordan, yeah. - Riordan. - Yeah, that was it. - OK, Mr Riordan. Yeah, yeah. I want to make you see that before you presume the worst you should discount what seems impossible. Who the hell said that, then? Sherlock Holmes? I've just said it. Right now. Alright. I would like to report the disappearance of my brother, please. Very well. Um, your brother's full name? - This will do you good. - Thank you. Oh, yeah, fruit salts, yeah, I know, I've... I've had this in England. No, this is Spanish. Three times a day. - And you'll be fine. - OK. I told you not to call me again! Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch! Uh, hello? Yeah, this is, um, Daniel Riordan's brother... Daniel? Uh, no. Uh, no, this is his brother, uh, Peter. Well, Daniel's disappeared. Hello? You don't know anything about him, do you? I'm sorry, but I haven't seen him in months. I was planning to see him like... Uh, no, no, this is, uh, Peter, his... his brother. Hello? Forgive me for... - What is that? - Never. Uh... hello? Nunca. Hello? ...has disappeared. Who is it? Oh, hi. Hello. I'm... This is, uh, this is Daniel Riordan's brother. Um, I'm... I'm looking for him. Uh, sorry. Did you hear me? It is, uh, Daniel Riordan's brother. - Daniel? - Alex? No, no, no. It's Peter. Sorry... Sorry for the shock. No. Yeah. No, I found Daniel's phone. It was under his bed, like... on buzzing, you know. And so I've just been going through the... through the numbers. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Oh, that's alright. Yeah. I've just had a long day. - Oh, right. - Are you hungry? Uh, yeah. But my stomach's been playing up a bit today. That's because you don't know where to eat. Can I have a smoke first? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, you've got... ...something on your... Yeah. Uh... Uh, no, no. You're right. Thanks. What... what is this? Black rice. Right. It's made with squid ink. Oh, right. It's alright! This isn't the first time Daniel's disappeared, but it's never been for this long. Do you know if he's ever had any problems with the law? He's never had any problems paying the club's debts. I don't know about his other businesses. But what? What, uh... What other businesses? Daniel and I didn't talk much about anything. Even though we were partners in the club. Right, yeah. I understand. Yeah. No. I don't think you do understand. I think... you worry too much. And the day you least expect it, Daniel's just gonna walk through the door with a suitcase full of souvenirs and a bottle of tequila under his arm. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe so. Yeah. I, uh, I don't... I don't think I told you, did I? But, um... ...I really... ...I really liked your show. No, you didn't tell me. - Didn't I? - Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's, like... It's... ...really...like, poetic. Yeah. Thank you. I just do it for fun from time to time when one of the girls is away or sick, just to not get out of practice. Right. But why Pearl? Oh! F... I mean... - Yeah, I know it, like... - I know. Pfft! Sorry. Ha ha. No, but it's not only that. I like white things. Well, you live in the ideal place. The only white thing in la Costa Blanca is its name. I mean, the other things seem white. They're not. Like, however pure they seem, there's always something a little dirty in them. And that doesn't... that doesn't happen with pearls, then. Pearls are the whitest, most beautiful thing that exists. Like snow. Exactly! But, unfortunately, it doesn't snow in Benidorm. Ah. But it's not impossible. No. In suitable conditions, with a storm from the east and the emergence of cold air of polar origin, for example, solid precipitation would not be impossible in more southerly latitudes. Are you a scientist? Yeah. No. Meteorology is... Well, it's like a hobby, you know. I think you're in urgent need of a new hobby. Yeah. Yes, still, Daniel and I were really close as kids. You know, our parents, well, they drank a lot, you know, both of them, actually, and we always sort of protected each other, yeah. There's only a year between us. Like, we did everything together. People used to ask us if we were twins. Were you and Daniel, like, um... I don't wanna talk about Daniel anymore. Right. How about you, then? I mean... where are you from? I can't make your accent out. How did you... I don't wanna talk about my life either. It was boring enough to live it. Right. And people come here for so many reasons and actually they're all pretty predictable. Oh, well, I'm sure it's fascinating. I mean... Have you been thinking about me? Uh... - Yep. - What were you thinking? Maybe I should have left Manchester long before now. Yes. Long before. You're something Daniel wasn't. What's that? Innocent. Well, thanks, uh... Thanks for bringing me back. You're welcome. Goodnight. Yeah. Do you want to come up? No. That's alright. Yeah. Another night. Yeah. At times, there are nights when I feel as if the world were ending and I just need to know I'm not the only survivor. That, if I die, someone will be there to close my eyes. Maybe one of those nights. Yeah. One of those nights. Thanks. Goodnight, then. Alex? Are those boots comfortable to drive in? No, of course not. I didn't think so. What are we doing here? - This is Daniel's house. - This is dead. I didn't think it would be in this state. There are a lot of abandoned sites around here. You know, the crisis. Brexit. The drought. Laundered money. The end of the world. He bought this? He built it. Ha. Well, he didn't. The company that he was a partner or a representative or whatever, they did. They invested a lot of money in this promotion. Well, and they have lost it. Yeah. The company went bankrupt, couldn't pay back their loans, and the banks didn't want to appropriate the real estate 'cause the value had dropped too much. They don't like to show assets as losses on their balance sheets. You really talk like a banker. Well, the bank decided to let them try and sell the houses through their own estate agency. Who's gonna buy this? Well, somebody did. Some Russians, in fact. There was a purchase agreement in the strongbox for one million euros. Just one million euros? Yeah. I don't think it would have settled the debts, but it certainly helped. In one of the clauses, Daniel earmarked this house for himself. If you like abandoned places, I can show you one that's a lot more fun. What do you say? I've got nothing better to do. It's funny, I was... ...never that keen on fun fairs when I was a kid. Why? Too much excitement? Hmm. Maybe. Uh... You... you actually are gonna go in there, then? Why? You never do anything just because? Never. Some things are more beautiful when they're rusty, don't you think? Why did you bring me in here? I wanted to be alone with you in a dark place. At times the light in Benidorm, it doesn't let you see. I see you. You do? What do you see? The most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Wow, Peter Riordan, you have hidden talents. And the loneliest. Well, you certainly stopped to think about that. That's my hidden talent. All of us are all alone. Some people just hide it better than others. Hmm. Oh! Jesus! Phwoar! Ahh. Oh. Look, I'm not walking down 42 fucking flights of stairs. I'll see you later. Uh, do you speak English? Yes. A little. Oh. Uh, good. Uh, this is the right address? Oh, good. Um... Are you the, uh, owner of the butcher's? No. Uh, could I get in touch with him, please? Uh, with, uh, Mr... No. sorry. Uh... No. Or, um, Mr Daniel Riordan? Uh, no... no... no idea. I'm sorry. - Right. Uh... - Are you going to buy anything? We have, uh, lamb chops. No, I'm fine, thanks. Yeah. - Well... yeah. - Hmm. So, the officer said you were here. Oh, it's you! I've got these. Ah, OK. It's Daniel's files. Mm-hm. Daniel had real estate businesses. I haven't been able to find any of his other partners, apart from the butcher's. Uh... I'm sure it won't be difficult for you, though. Maybe somebody there will know his whereabouts. I mean, it's... it's all in here - names, addresses, pictures, everything. Alright. Thank you. - We'll see where this leads us. - Hmm. And if you don't mind giving us your brother's phone? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. - Oh, thank you. Um... right. Uh, there. So, uh, can I start supposing the worst now? Well, look at the positive side. Maybe your brother didn't stand you up after all. You've got a very strange sense of humour, Officer. Yes. That's what my husband says. According to him, reading a lot of poetry can't be good. Yeah, well, Sylvia Plath, she was the one that killed herself by putting her head in the gas oven. - Wasn't she? - Yeah. Yeah, well, maybe your husband's got a point, then. You can't reduce an artist to the way in which they died. In fact, when she was here in Benidorm, that's when she was happiest. Hang on. Sylvia Plath was... was here? Yes. In 1956. She rented a little fisherman's house next to the sea, when there wasn't a single skyscraper in the city. This is exactly the view she had of a morning. Her house was here. And guess where I live now. Hmm. Every morning, I see the same things she must have seen. The fact is, Sylvia caused a bit of a commotion in the city because she wore a bikini, something that had never been seen here before. My father was playing ball on the beach. He kicked it and the ball landed just where she was lying. My father went over to pick it up. Sylvia sat up, got the ball and handed it to him. He stood looking at her, hypnotised. She smiled and said to him... He says he had never seen anything like it. - Hello. - Hello Um... Do you happen to have 'The Bell Jar' by Sylvia Plath? Oh, uh, we had 'Ariel', for sure, but let me check. Thank you. Here you go. Alright, thanks. Oh! Thank you. You're welcome. Do you know she lived here? Don't you? So I'm told, yeah. - OK. - Thanks. Flat rate for sangria! All you can drink for 15 euros! Hey, man, do you want to watch the game? A free pint for every goal. Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yeah, yeah, yeah, live strippers and live sex show in Club Africa. Do you want to try? Just come here. Sorry? What did you say? Club Africa? Club Africa! Yeah. Go in, go in and enjoy. Good club. Perfect for you. Excuse me. I wonder if you could help me. I'm... I'm looking for my... my brother. Uh, I have reason to think that he... he came here regularly. I can't help you. Do you want to drink something? Uh, well, yeah, but I haven't even told you what he looks like yet. Everybody looks the same here. Yeah, but, uh, maybe if you, um, have a look. Uh, it doesn't matter how unfamiliar you think he is. Um... I forgot... Find them... Uh... Yeah, look, yeah. There he is. His... his name is Daniel. Daniel Riordan. I'm sorry. Well, maybe if you can, you know, show the photo to some of your... some of your companions? You want to drink something or not? Uh, yes, sure. Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hm. - Octopus. - Octopus! Oh, right. So, I've heard of this Esteban Campos. I didn't know that he and Daniel were working together. No, well, uh, they didn't know anything about him at Club Africa or... or at the butcher's. How much did you offer them? Wait. What do you mean? Like... like, money? Huh? Wow. A banker who doesn't know that everything has a price? You really are a weirdo. Right. Oh. Alright. - Huh? - It's, like... It's alive. It's good. Mmm. It's alive? No, I hope not. Thank you. Yeah. Uh, prawn. The head is the best part. Try. OK. I don't know whether I'll... ...I'll go for the head, like, um... A few years ago, the banks were just giving out loans like candy for buying land, houses. People had no idea about investments. The only thing they knew was that if you weren't doing it, you were stupid. Well, you didn't do it, then. Too much money, too many problems. Oh, it doesn't sound stupid at all, to be honest. Are you flattering me? Well, I don't know. Yeah. I might be. - Hey, mate, alright. - No? Alright, OK, look, look, here, here. That's it. - Just don't hurt us, alright? - OK. OK. - Go on. Go, go, go. - No! No, no, you don't need it! Just take it, please. No. There's no need for this, please. Ugh! Oh, shit. You alright? Hey, you... Did he take anything? Oh! It hurts, but it's not broken. - Yeah, but it's alright. - Mm-hm. - Yep. - That's nice. Ow! Change my hand. What is this place? La Muralla Roja. Come in. Uh, is somebody else here? Lucy. Lucy? Sit down. - OK. - I'll get you some ice. Alright. Alright. Thanks. So does Lucy clean everywhere, then? Lucy's been cleaning for me for some time. I was the one who recommended her for your building. She, uh... She makes me a bit nervous. She, um... She makes these, like, uh, figures out of towels and leaves them on... on my bed. She's a sweetheart. She's had a really hard life. Really hard. Right. She learned in jail... ...to make the figurines with the towels. You Brits don't trust anyone who doesn't speak English. That's not true. It's not true! Do you want to sleep over? Yes. I mean... just to sleep? Yeah. I mean, just stay until I fall sleep. Yeah. Thank you. Tonight's... Is it one of those nights when you need to know that there's a nuclear catastrophe, that there's someone here to... to close your eyes? Yeah. Right. - Hey, my friend! my friend! - Yeah? What? What? - Hey. - Yeah? It's better if you come with us. - What is it? Hang on. - Huh? What? What? - Hello! - OK? Shh, shh, shh. Help! Help! You, outside. Alright. Yeah, hang on. Ohh! Oh! Phew! God. What? Alright, alright. - Sit. - Alright. - Sit! - Yeah, alright. Alright. - Sit. - Yeah, alright. MAN, THEN CAMPOS: Nice to meet you, Mr Riordan. Ahh. How do you do? My name is Esteban Campos. My grandfather opened this butcher's. He was from AlmerÃ­a. But in the early years of tourism, he left his home town, his family and the sheep they had reared for generations, and came to Benidorm. It's a modest business, but he was very proud of it. And my father after him. You know, I was just eight when I cut up my first lamb. My father congratulated me and bought me an ice cream. I remember that while I ate it, my hands were still smelling of blood. Um... I'm sorry. Why are you telling me this? The day I met your brother, I told him the same story. I wanted him to know I'm not a businessman. I'm just a simple town butcher. Alright. Everything I've built, I've done it with effort. No-one has given me anything. And that's why I won't let anyone take it from me. Alright. Well, I don't understand what... What do you know about Daniel? What do I know? Uh, uh, nothing. I don't... You've been going around asking about him for days. You turned up here and you went to my club. Well, yeah, well, but that's because I'm looking for him! He's disappeared without a trace, for God's sake. Um... I don't... But do you know what's happened to him? Your brother and I are partners. We had a real estate project along with my brother-in-law. Yeah, well, that's in Los Lirios, right? Mm-hm. - Yeah. The business didn't take off, but we were lucky enough to find a buyer. At first, Daniel wasn't willing to sell. He said the price was too low, but it was the only way to settle the debts. And, uh, some guys from Moscow were keen to buy. Well, I saw the contracts. What contracts? They... they were in a, like, strongbox in his apartment. Do you have them? I gave them to the police. What you certainly don't know is that once the sale went through... ...your brother Daniel transferred all the money to an account overseas and disappeared. But, no, no, no. That's... That's impossible. No, he... Daniel would never do a thing like that. - He just... - And yet he did it. I've tried a thousand ways to find him. And when I learned that you were asking for him... I'm sorry if my methods were too expeditious, but we are very angry. Well, have you reported him? The police aren't going to do anything. Daniel is just another evader. One of so many in this country. But who knows? Nothing is impossible in Benidorm. My father saw that Sylvia Plath in a bikini. Did everybody here see Sylvia Plath in a bikini? No. Not everyone. Just the father of the policewoman you talked to. He's my father too. We are brother and sister. As different as Daniel and you, I guess. No. Well... Anyway, your brother will contact you sooner or later. And if he doesn't? Maybe not today or tomorrow, but one day you'll get a message from him... ...at Christmas, on your birthday. And I'm convinced that then you will choose to do the right thing. I have patience. It's one of my main virtues. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Great. I'm sorry about the kidnapping. It isn't my style. And you needn't tell my sister about it. I'm sure she knows already. Oof. No. Do you like lamb? Baby lamb chops? Uh, yeah. They are delicious. Grilled. Walder will prepare some for you. It's on the house, of course. Uh, excuse me. Uh, uh... Can I go now? Yeah, of course. 'Bye! Alright. Don't forget the chops! Yeah. Uh... Uh, Alex, hi, hi. It's... it's Peter. Um... When you get this message, could you call me straightaway, please? It's... It's urgent. Very urgent. Oh! Oh. He voted to leave Brexit. I didn't understand that because he said he wanted all the Muslims to leave. He obviously didn't realise the Muslims don't come from Luxembourg. But in my opinion, he'd have been better off doing a survey of bellybuttons. Yes, I know. After all, innies or outies, we are a nation, in my opinion, of outies. And on that note, I'm going! Because when all is said and done, who cares what goes on as long as we're having fun! Mm-hm. Alright, I'm back again. He had me kidnapped! They put me in a refrigerator. And his sister is the policewoman who likes poetry! And Benidorm is kinda cool that way, right? Yeah, but you don't seem very worried. Well, they sent you back in one piece. Yeah, but he kidnapped me! Admit it, you never thought you'd utter those words, did you? Uh, no. Oh! Who's that? Oh, hang on. It's the police. Right. Excuse me a minute. Uh, hello? Yes, this is... Yeah, this is Peter, Daniel Riordan's brother, yeah. That was, um, Marta, the Sylvia Plath policewoman. So? Well, it... it appears that the police have found Daniel's name on a passenger list for a flight to Banjul in... in the Gambia. Banjul? Banjul is hotter than Benidorm. Yeah, but... I mean, it's like he's... ...you know, he's done a runner, anyhow. OK, sweetie. See, he doesn't deserve you worrying about him so much. Yeah, but he's... He's my brother! You and Daniel share a surname and two watches. You really didn't like him at all, did you? Well, I... No. No. We worked together and we had fun sometimes, but Daniel didn't respect the people he worked with and he treated the girls in this club like shit, the waiters, Lucy... If you don't respect those who clean your bathroom and make your bed, you're finished, for me. Ah, it's... It's just so disappointing, you know. Do you want a tequila? Yeah. Anything. Yeah. It's... it's... I didn't... didn't know him. To Banjul? Banjul. I'd never heard of it. The first time I came here, I didn't even think I'd last a week. I literally spent the whole time trying to figure out how to get out of here. And then one morning, I listened to them and I understood something. I just understood that while you still want to sing, or be silly or get lost or make mistakes, fall in love, make mistakes and fall in love... ...you're not finished. Do you think it's too late to take up singing lessons? - Huh? - Huh? - "You are always there." - Oh! "Tremulous breath at the end of my line "Curve of water upleaping "To my water rod..." Ohh! - "Dazzling..." - Dazzling! "..And grateful. - "Touching..." - Touching? - "And sucking." - And sucking! Ohhh! After she had electric shock therapy, she felt like she'd been... let out of a bell jar. Often I can relate to that. It's very funny you talking about Sylvia Plath with chocolate ice cream on your face. I'm leaving tomorrow. I know. I've got a present for you. Thank you. Oh. It's really nice. Come with me. What? Where? Manchester? Yeah. Yeah, look, there's still no word from Daniel, is there? I mean, God knows when he's gonna call. I mean, if you don't find another partner, you... - I'll get by. I always have. - I'll take care of you, Alex. I, uh... The last thing in the world I want So you intend to spend the rest of your life in nightclubs? Pulling pearls out of my cunt? Say it. I'm good at numbers. I'm a cool manager. - I know how to deal with people. - Yeah. Yeah. I'll say what I say to all men and women who ask me that, including your brother... Maybe I don't want to hear it now. I could have had another life. I had it and I didn't like it. And maybe one day I'll leave. I'll cook, I'll read, I'll go for walks on the beach, I'll get fat. That will be enough for you? Yes. I'll pick you up at 9:00. Alright. OK. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thanks. You OK? It looks like I'll never get rid of you. Oh. Hello. I'm cold. Shh! Don't talk. Where... Where am I? You fainted, they brought you to the hospital and they called me. They called you? - I don't want to be here. - Don't move. No. I want to go to the beach. You don't know what you're saying. Just can you lie down, please? No, no, it's just a stomach-ache. No-one faints because of that. Fr... I'm... I'm really freezing in here. Give me this. I want to feel the sun touching me. Someday... ...will you let me walk with you? If you don't mind being seen with a woman with white hair and a lot of extra pounds. I won't mind. I won't mind. The weather is a way to feel there's always something happening, and if there isn't... ...there's always a promise.
