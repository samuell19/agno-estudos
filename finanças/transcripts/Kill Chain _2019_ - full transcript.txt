Two rooms. You only have two customers. Slow season. Well, how do you make a living? Low overhead. Occasional opportunity. The "occasional opportunity"? You know, where you’re standing, that’s for employees only. Oh. Pardon. Bad neighborhood. Yeah, it must be. Shotgun and... whatever you’ve got underneath your shirt. All right. You guys took your time circling around... Yeah, we had to drive about half a mile send your picture, you know, get confirmation. Internet sucks. Should have come in. Got free Wi-Fi. How long you had this place? About a year. Friend of mine left it to me. What we hear, you don’t have any friends. Not anymore. Standing still for a year, you had to know that was gonna be too long. I had obligations, and... you get tired. That’s something you should have thought about in the first place. You know the story? We don’t give a shit about the story. We hear lots of stories. See, he’s not gonna appreciate it, but you might. A short one, yeah, sure. Buy you a beer. You can cut me off if you get bored. Me and Franco... Hey. On the way, inside an hour. Okay. Hey, you good? You know anything about rice cookers? What? They come in a travel size. Think it’s over-priced, though. What? You want me to do some research on rice cookers? Sure. You know what? Nah, I’ll do my own research. You know what? Tell me what you find out. Jesus, you need to get laid. Who says I don’t get laid? Hey, Dad. Hey. What do you know about rice cookers? Not much. I’m thinking about getting one. Why? I travel a lot. I eat a lot of rice. Is rice expensive? Almost never. So... You’re smart. You’re a smart young woman. Something only a dad would say. Well, I’m sure. I’m sure you U Penn would disagree, right? Grades are fine and I got the check. Thank you. Didn’t seem like much. Tuition’s covered and I work at the lab a few nights. Should you be working? I mean, shouldn’t you be focused on... Mom worked through college. She’d have wanted it to be easier for you. I’d rather it wasn’t too easy, you know? True. I don’t know what your schedule is like, but I’ve got a break coming up. Yeah, yeah. Um... yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, right. Look, I know... What did I do, Dad? Why can’t I see you? No, you didn’t do anything. Five years. It’s been five years. Someday I’m gonna tell you the reason and you’ll wish I hadn’t. Jesus! What am I supposed to do with that? This isn’t normal! The money-- The money’s what I’ve got right now. Look, I’ve gotta get back to work. I love you. I love you too, Dad. All right, I’ll buy you the fuckin’ rice cooker. Rifle on the other side of the hot zone. Two UFOs sitting in a car. Well, maybe the object. Without an advance security, I don’t know. Maybe police? No. No, the police have been managed. It is definitely not the police. -You sure? -No, no. I’m an asshole who hasn’t kept you alive and safe for 10 years. Right down this plate. 78AJUG. 78AUG. 78AJUG. Take this fuckin’ seriously. What the fuck... What? Call me back. Hey! Two is better than one, honey. Do I make her... Do I make you nervous? No, baby, not at all. No one’s nervous. Just thought you might want a little taste of home. How you end up down here? There’s a story there. Story’s not as sad as you’re thinking. Not as different from mine as you’re thinking. Which is why I can’t have you come up here and make me fall in love with you. Go. It’s unlocked! Okay if I turn on a light? No. Okay. Hey. Walk over to that window. Take off your top. Anything under the skirt? That’s good. Now open the blinds. It’s a blue Skoda. See it? They’re gone, baby. You know them? Keep looking out the window. They cops? -No. -How do you know? I just gave the mean one a blow job. That makes them not a cop? He paid. They have guns? I didn’t see. They’re the type that might? Yeah. Are you jerking off? Maybe. The roof across the street, the one with the construction. You see it? Yeah. Can you get up there? Yeah, but it’s empty. It’s an empty building. Nah, my friend’s up there. He’s working late. Close the blinds. Put your clothes back on. So you really don’t wanna fuck? No, not since my daughter was 14. You have a phone? -Here. -All right. I want you to go up on the roof and say hello to Mr. Sanchez. Whatever he wants, it’s on me. Like a joke? Yeah. Yeah, like a joke. After, you can have the rest. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Blue Skoda. It’s a rental. Got a couple names, but they won’t mean shit to you because they don’t mean shit to me. -American? -Out of Miami. You got a bad feeling about this, get the fuck out. I leave without knowing what the fuck is going on, then I don’t know what the fuck is going on. -Who else is down here? -What do you mean? Other tradesmen. Who’s active here? Well, shit. You know, let me check Facebook. None of yours? You know I would have mentioned it. Would you? Probably not, but I’m telling you... Hello? Let me say hello to my friend. It’s for you. No way. No way you saw me. I recognized your puke green MSR. You supposed to do me before or after I take the shot? Kind of a moot point now. Come on, Sanchez. Tits at the window was a good fuckin’ move, man. But I’m always improving on you. You don’t think I’d shoot you right through her? I’m the one person in the world that knows you won’t. One chance. Come over. I’ll buy you a beer. Nah. I don’t drink, Viejo. Shit, Viejo. You shoulda took the shot. She’s dead anyway. But you always did leave the dirty work for me. Nah... not like that, Viejo. So what now? Window maybe? You go for the door? I got all day while you move the dresser. Start running, you double-dealing fuck. From what? You? You can’t make a decision about a fuckin’ rice cooker. Well, that’s why you tipped the target and sold them Sanchez to double on me? You’re the target, you asshole. Who? I never ask. You know that. It was money. And you’re past your sell-by date. You don’t fuck anymore, you don’t drink, I would have walked away. You should have let me walk away. You try and then a year or two later, the pangs of conscience get worse and worse and worse. You know it, and then you go off and tell someone! Yeah? Yeah? Well, you shoulda taken a chance, Dean, now, now-- Now, now, now what? If you make it outta that room, you’d better fuckin’ ghost. Because the day you’re spotted, someone goes to U Penn to the Ridgeman Dorms. And then God knows what’s gonna-- Fuck you! Fuck you, Dean! Fuck you! Dad... Hey. I’m sorry. Oh, don’t apologize. You have nothing to apologize for. You grew up so well, I just figured being around would’ve fucked things up. But maybe I fucked up anyway, yeah. Maybe there’s just no right answer, no. I know you love me. I know you’re doing your best. I am. I did. I am doing my best. I just, um... I just want us to be good. We’re great, Dad. Okay, then. Okay, Dad, goodnight. Goodnight. Tell me it’s done. Yes, sir. You all right? I know the two of you had history. Oh, that was years ago, not that it wasn’t weird. Someday you’ll do the same to me, right? Not if you’re smarter than he was. Should be a red Renault. Up on blocks? No one steals a stripped car. Payment is in the shifter box. Problem? No, they’re here. Hey, man, you sure about this shit? I got GIA certificates. Don’t worry. What... what are GIA certificates? It means the diamonds are legit. It’s how the client wanted to pay. The guy in Panama is set to convert them for you. Killing this phone now. Talk to you in a month. Hands, fuckface! Yeah. Hey. Hey, come on, man. Stripping a stripped car? Doesn’t make sense. Ah, fuck! Try me. -All right. -You fuckin’ angry? And I believe he intended to shoot you. Looked that way, didn’t it? Who gave me up? All right, that’s good. It’s a good sign. Yeah? If you were gonna dump me on the side of the road, you’d tell me, right? Unless... You can shut up now. Oh, shit. I see. It’s G-Man’s snitch and he doesn’t trust you. Hey, man, seriously, man. How long we been working together, man? You still can’t speak decent fuckin’ Spanish? I know enough to know when I’m being rat-fucked. Hey, I don’t give a shit which one of you I make a deal with, all right? Oh, motherfucker! That was a good one! You want me to shut the fuck up, buddy? You’re gonna have to hit me harder than that. That’s just turning me on. Jesus, Miguel... Miguel... you’re just encouraging him! It’s a long fucking ride, you know. It keeps me awake. Oh, yeah? Long ride to where? Huh? Where we going? Look, the diamonds are worth 250. First one of you kills the other, I’ll bump it another 250. That’s 375 more than either of you is expecting. You know I’m good for it. I got it. Oh, shit, look. He’s thinking about it. You better act fast. Your man, he’s thinking about it. ’Cause he’s gonna trust a greasy piece of shit like you, hmm? Oh! What the fuck are you doing, man? Hey, man, come on. This making you fuckin’ feel better? Relax. Fuckin’ relax. I’m relaxed. Hey, you know what? G-Man is trying to figure out how to fuckin’ shoot you from the back seat... Just pull over, man. Let me break his jaw. It’s just words, man. What the fuck you care about words? Pull over. Let me break his fuckin’ jaw! 500! 500! 500! Just get this shit movin’! Just get-- What? Now we’re riding around with a dead fuckin’ body, man. It’s not the first time. Pull over. We’ll throw him in the trunk. Clean up a little. Quit fucking with me. Seriously, how much money have we made together? Not this much, man. Not all at once. Fuck you, man, fuck you. Exactly. That’s what I’m afraid of, man. Exactly that. So, what? What’s the plan here? You just gonna drive around all night? This car doesn’t run outta gas? You know what? It’s okay, man. Just empty your fuckin’ gun and it’s fine. It’s fine. Empty? You fucking kidding me? I’m not fucking kidding you, motherfucker! You know we’re through after this. Yeah, Lance, I fuckin’ know. No. I’ll fuckin’ shoot you, Lance. -You’re gonna anyway. -No, I’m not. Then unload your gun. I’m not fuckin’ doing that. You crazy? ’Cause I can trust you, but you can’t trust me? Well, you shot the fucking guy, man-- Because he was getting in our heads! He got us here! Well, Lance... Here we are. Partner? Yeah. Here we are. Okay, man. Fuck! That’s it. Tell me you’re not gonna run, partner? Not while I got the diamonds! Sorry, Miguel. Agh! Open the kit. See what we got. Not a lot. Well, do what you can. We gotta figure out a story. What happened? It... ...got a little messy. Oh, Lance. Oh, we’re okay, we’re okay. He shot me. Not through and through, is it? The bullet come out the other side? Is there a hole? No. Right on the money, huh? My man was right on the money. And all it cost was a little part of my soul, the part I wasn’t using. Miguel was bad, bad as me... but I shouldn’t have shot him. You killed him for me. He didn’t give me a choice. But if I’m being honest, I knew he wouldn’t. Even if he knew why, I needed it all. I think I would have been better if I-- No. Nothing is better than this. Yeah? Yeah? Listen to me, Arana’s meeting us at Hotel del Franco with a new passport and papers. Get you on the plane to Bonn. I come by with a new passport in a week, new identities for both of us. Then... Then? It’s fucking happening. A year, but it’s happening. There’s no way she could have followed me here. Puta! I’m not going to kill you! I love you! Fucking love you! Arana gets the biggest diamond. That’s his payment. Got it? We are doing this together. Please! I’ll meet you at the hotel. Hey, Ericson! You think being a cop protects you? You think being an American protects you? You fucked my woman! I’m gonna fucking kill you! Go. Go! Come out... Street. One night. I’m supposed to ask for ID and a credit card. Okay. If you need anything... You here all night? I was gonna say, "Dial 00." Yes, I am. Bourbon and tequila and bourbon. And beer. Tequila and beer. Thought you were the clerk. Clerk, bartender, security guard, owner. Owner? What happened to Franco? You know Franco? No. I read the sign. I won this place in a poker game. Really? It was a long game and it turns out it’s not worth that much. Is that why you do everything yourself? I have people during the day. At night, though... You like the quiet? I don’t get much sleep anyway. Bad dreams? What makes you say that? Everyone has bad dreams. That’s not your real answer. That’s what you came up with right after you wished you hadn’t asked the question. You talk to all your hotel guests like this? You know a man named Arana? Spanish for "spider", right? I don’t know him. I’m supposed to be meeting him here. Meeting a guy named Arana? Nothing good can come of that. You mean, a woman like me meeting a guy named Arana? Well, I think you’ve met some Aranas in your time, probably some Snakes and Lobos too. What makes you say that? Just... the way you drink, how nervous you are... How nervous you’re not. Franco’s dead, isn’t he? The back of your neck, that scar’s from a knife. The one on your hand, that’s from a bullet. Maybe I had one really bad day. You have the eyes and the hands of a violent man. I know, because I know violent men. So the questions are... did Franco die by your hand and why? And does a violent man really think he’s gonna find peace behind a hotel desk? What are the answers? Those aren’t my questions. I’ll bill your room. Your business is worse than mine. It’s all about the quality, not the quantity. Does it get lonely wandering around that empty hotel? I see people walk in, take one look around and walk right back out. Maybe I’m turning them away. Mm. Me too. Only tonight, this guy wanted to fall in love with me. There’s always that danger. Seen Gigi? Not for a few hours. She must have gone home, then. Guess I’ll do the same. You know, I see you almost every night and steal your cigarettes. You never once asked me to throw you one. And you never once asked me how I ended up down here. You never asked me either. That’s what we like about each other. So what’s the pitch? The pitch? I’m not delusional enough to think you find me irresistible. No. You’re a man who understands the mechanics of this world, but not its appetites. It has got me this far. Would you walk out of here tonight? Where would I be walking to? Would you? For the right reason? What’s a right reason look like? When you played cards with Franco and he put the deed down to this place, what gave it value to you? Money, pleasure? So we’re not discussing reasons. We’re negotiating payment. Would you prefer a cause? You don’t strike me as a cause. More of a rabbit hole. A rabbit hole. I fall into you knowing full well there’s going to be a hard landing. I’m getting out of a difficult situation, becoming a new person, a person I thought I would have been by now. Arana is giving you a new identity, way out of the city? The country? It has to be quickly, tonight. Because you’re using someone else’s money. -I don’t see it that way. -But someone does. You’re right. I’ve known Aranas and Snakes. I know how to handle them. But they don’t know that at first. At first, it’s easier to have someone like me around to deal with the Snakes and Aranas. But you couldn’t have planned for that, for me being here. A plan is just an action that you sit and contemplate for so long that it becomes complicated. I’d rather move from opportunity to opportunity. I saw your knuckles, your scars. And I recognized an opportunity, same as you saw in me. I’m not the guy you think I am. You don’t want to be, but you are. If I could go, I would, but I can’t. Can’t or won’t? You think I’d say no to you if I had the choice? Well, it seems like you are. It really is can’t. Though I don’t like my chances with you... or her. She’ll kill me. And me, if she smells your perfume. Behind the staircase, there’s an exit out into the alley. I have to go back to my room first. For money you don’t think is hers? It’s worth way more than this hotel, way more than what Franco died for. That’s not gonna make me move any faster! All right, all right. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Don’t shoot, don’t shoot, please. -Oso! -Sorry. Don’t shoot. I’m sorry. This was Franco’s place. Yeah, he sold it to me. When was that? Uh, about a week before he disappeared. You got proof? You need it? Do you know who I am? Not specifically, but you are a type. I am a type. Are you a type, too? Yeah, the kind that doesn’t want to get shot. Good, because the whores may like you, but they answer to me. A girl came in traveling light, probably offered to fuck you not to tell me she’s here. Well, now I wish she would have shown up a little later. Yeah, Room 27, up the stairs on the left. She in? I don’t know. I was in my office. You know, I don’t have all the answers. Ola? Um... Ola? You could have given her any key, any goddamn room. The one with your suitcase in it. She’ll sit and wait a while. Buys you time to get out of here. She’ll hunt me down and kill me. I don’t think so. You don’t either. You think you can talk your way out of this, probably have before. Now the questions are, should you? And is your friend worth more to you than whatever you stole from her? They’re not my questions, of course. You might want to go out through the alley and come back in through the front. For appearances sake. Mm. Salud. You fuck her? Either way, she’s going to say that you did. And then? We already killed her lover tonight. So here we are. I wouldn’t be sitting there too long. I was thinking the same thing. You think that thumb trick would work a second time? Think it’s the only trick I know? Love. Whatever she thinks will make it stop. I wasn’t waiting to start. Of course. You don’t mean shit to her. You get that, right? Not to her. To you, though. Do you think you can run far enough, fast enough? I think I’m pretty light on my feet. Not with her hanging onto your fucking legs! What’s the offer? What do you want? You just made an argument for killing you. Don’t ask me what you think your fucking goddamned life is worth. She took jewelry, maybe $100,000 in cash, hidden here somewhere for sure. Shoot her and it’s all fucking yours. I don’t have anything against her. You don’t have anything against me either. I kind of don’t like you. And I did enjoy fucking her. Just kill this fucking bitch so we can walk out of here, please. You picked the wrong one this time. He’s not a killer. She’s right. Bullshit! Because you were looking at the scars, not at the man who lost the taste for it. Now get your purse and get out of here! -And then what? -She gets a head start. And you get what she stole from me? Maybe. Back up! -Fuck, no! -Fuck, yes! No! Fuck, no! -Fuck you! -Fuck, no! You fucking bitch! You bitch. I assumed you had a gun in your purse. I did. I just got to the knife first. We need to get rid of the body. Bring my car around back. Clean up the blood the best you can. And then roll her up in the bedspread. Okay. First, though, the money and the jewelry. It goes in the safe until after she’s outta here so you don’t get the idea to leave me with this. And after? I don’t take money I didn’t earn. I know it sounds unlikely but... You’re just gonna have to wait and see. And the rest? That’s all. Except for what you were gonna pay Arana in your bra on your left breast where you kept me from touching you. I mean, I’d love to go looking for it. But now’s not the time, is it? You might want to clean yourself up a little too. Two rooms. You only have two customers. Slow season. How do you make a living? Low overhead. Occasional opportunity. The "occasional opportunity". You know, where you’re standing, that’s for employees only. Oh. Pardon. Bad neighborhood. Yeah, it must be. Shotgun and whatever you got underneath your shirt. All right. You guys took your time circling around... Yeah. We had to drive about half a mile to send your picture, get confirmation. Internet sucks. Should’ve come in. Got free Wi-Fi. How long have you had this place? About a year. A friend of mine left it to me. Well, we hear you don’t have any friends. Not anymore. Standing still for a year, you had to know that was gonna be too long. I had obligations, and... you get tired. That something you could’ve thought about in the first place. You know the story? Nah, we don’t give a shit about the story. We hear lots of stories. See, he’s not gonna appreciate it, but you might. A short one? Yeah, sure. I’ll buy you a beer. You can cut me off if you get bored. Me and Franco... -Franco like this place? -Yeah. This is him. He had a different name before. He changed it after he bought this place. Cheaper than buying a new sign. Actually, a lot more expensive. See, me and Franco used to be you and you. I guess I was you because Franco wasn’t an asshole. The organization found us doing PMC work. PMC? Private Military Contractors, mercenaries, ex-Rangers, ex-Seals. Which were you? Franco was a Ranger. I was a... truck driver. Saved his life, more by accident than anything else, if I’m being honest. He took me under his wing. You know, you’re not helping me keep this story short. Our people hired you and Franco? Is it okay if I fix myself a drink? Please do. Turned out we were working for them and didn’t even know it. Cameroon. I learned why they called them "blood diamonds". Franco was a genius at that shit. How to track people down, when to kill them, when to let... What did the organization tell you? That you stole money. That would be part of the cautionary tale. So after Cameroon, Franco and I are sent all over the world taking care of shit. Ah! That’s me and him. Right. Seven years ago, Mexican Border Patrol seizes the shipment. Me and Franco were sent south with a bag of money. Cops tried to haggle for more. So the organization says, "Teach ’em a lesson! Burn the shipment! Bring back the money!" Which was good and well. Nothing new. Except it was a shipment of girls, Eleven, ten. Nine years old. Yeah, so... Aw, this is bullshit. Now why the fuck would I make up a story like this? So I wouldn’t kill you. Jesus Christ! You are fucking dim. I was you, remember? I heard plenty of stories, worse stories! It’s all secondhand. It’s abstract to you. It’s not staring at a cage full of little girls and know... light them on fire, or never go home. So you kept the money and bolted? And cut the girls loose. Any one of the three things was enough to get us killed. But my feeling is setting the girls loose was what really pissed them off because then they had to send someone else to hunt them down and round them up. And do what we didn’t. Someone with a tolerance for that kind of heinous shit. Maybe even an appetite for it. So they died anyway? All of that was for nothin’. Didn’t seem like it at the time, not for Franco, especially. He took one of the girls. No, you assholes, not like that! A switch flipped, rolled him back past working for the organization, back past the merc shit in Cameroon, back to the guy he imagined he’d be when he signed up to fight for his country! He wanted to be a good guy, a decent guy. Bought this place, bought a new identity. He raised that girl like a daughter. This guy’s fuckin’ dead. Yeah, I poisoned him. We’re almost to that part. Relax. If I’d been able to pull that trick twice we wouldn’t still be talking. Let’s just do this, man. /You want to hear the end, don’t you? I mean the thought of walking out of here and never having got to the point? Franco and the girl? His daughter for all intents and purposes! And just like any other daughter, she turned 17 and decides that she hates him. Gets involved with some asshole, convinces her to mule E. Doesn’t even make it out of town before she’s picked up by this tag team local policia and federal agent, Miguel Garcia and Lance Ericson. What happens next is anybody’s guess. Suffice it to say the pills disappear. Then the girl’s body turns up in a field... naked, tortured... cut into pieces! So what do you think Franco, hardcore soldier, mercenary, professional killer like your own bad selves, what do you think he does next? He goes after the motherfuckers. Goes after the motherfuckers! So insane with grief, he forgets every lesson he ever taught me about patience, about stealth. And I didn’t stop him. I didn’t stop Franco. Just like I didn’t stop... He’s an unguided missile. And these cops don’t exist in a vacuum. They’re on the payroll of a very bad woman... A woman who doesn’t give a shit about anybody’s adopted daughter, his boss, who also happens to be dead rolled up in a bedspread upstairs! So that’s why you been here a year? Yeah. Getting even for your dumb ass friend fucking up getting even for his dumb ass not-even-daughter? I take it back, man. That is the saddest fuckin’ story I’ve ever heard. I’m not surprised you see it that way. You cut it close, settling accounts right before we found you. I let you find me. You wanna die? Well, let’s just say I’ve had a good meal, and I’m not hungry anymore. And because the money won’t do me any good anymore, there’s a safe in my office. Cash, jewelry, plus about $250,000 in diamonds. This is the combination. You should have listened to your own story. That’s not enough to buy us off. -It’s not even close. -I know. It’s motivation for the person I’ve really been talking to. You had to hear the fucking story, huh? Let’s go! Ah! Woo! Come on. Almost worth seeing what you think you can do with that. But I been trying to get the fuck outta here for the last half hour. In my day, a professional wouldn’t use a strange gun without checking it first. Let’s go get your stuff. You’re Arana. I used a cutout to deal with your girlfriend, but, yeah, pretty much. Bad news is, I don’t have a new identity for you. Good news is, with her dead, you don’t need one. You couldn’t have known. Not everything. You leading her to me was definitely Plan B. Plan A was her and Lance killed each other. And maybe me. I would have felt badly about that. Not badly enough. No. Took them out of Cameroon. Never felt right about spending them. And those two out there? Bought me some time before their people send the next pair looking for me. I hate to cut this short, but I have a few last things to do before I go. Go where? What if I’d killed Sanchez? There was a Plan C. I didn’t kill those girls. I couldn’t. You didn’t stop it. No. I didn’t. I haven’t been right since. I haven’t been able to look at my daughter. You want me to say I’m sorry? You want me to say anything other than fuck you? Oh, well, you don’t have the right. No, I don’t. The guy you hired me through, when he finds out that Sanchez is dead, he’s gonna go after my daughter. Her number’s in there. It’s the only number in there. That’s not my problem. You set this in motion! What do you expect me to do? What you seem to do best. Just think of something. Oh, for Christ’s sake.
