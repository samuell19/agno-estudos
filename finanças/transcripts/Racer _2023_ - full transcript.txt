Based on what do people determine... ...if one has succeeded or failed in life? After much trouble, I took part in this race and I won. Does that mean I've won in life? Or, if I lose my life in this accident,... ...does that mean I've failed? Only the son who was scolded by his father knows... ...that advice is something bad. We'll make a movie like Ram's film. What do you say? -I have to go home today and fight. Give me ideas for that. Alcohol, it is bad for the country and family. We will drink for the first time and be bad boys. Have a peg. Not only your father, you can fight with anyone. What if we drink all three bottles? Sure, but tomorrow, your father will fight with me. Guys! -Cheers! Why is he drinking so seriously? Is your family that strict? Not only my family, the majority of people... ...in our country are like this. One, we should be born rich in this birth. We will be the kings! No one would question us. No one will stop us either. We can live as we please. Even if someone stands in the way, we can turn a deaf ear... ...because it is my grandpa's money. Hey, look, the car is back. He is going to throw money again. Let's go! The money is flying! Pick it up! Or we must be born poor like these boys. Our lives are in our hands. -Great! But if we are born into a middle-case family..... Dad, I want that. Why do you want that now? I've spent so much already. Get me a small vehicle. I have to spend so much on his education. Here, keep this. This happens often among the middle class. We get something smaller than what we ask for. But, we always have a big desire. Like the desire I had for this cycle. This is how I got this cycle..... Go faster, dad! When I went with my father on his motorcycle..... When can I ride this motorcycle, dad? You can only ride when your legs are long enough. So, I waited for my legs to be long enough. Dad! I started the motorcycle, dad. That day, there was an advertisement on TV. The new Bajaj motorcycle! You get 83 km for a litre. Can it go 80 km? This motorcycle is perfect for the current price of petrol. Can you speed with it, dad? -This doesn't move, it flies! A big motorcycle for dad, a small motorcycle for me. If everything we want comes true... There is no God... If you keep thinking about the past... There will be no peace... If everything we want comes true... Okay, let me ask him something that suits me. Dad, can you buy me a bicycle? Everyone who comes to tuition has a bicycle, dad. There is no place to park the bike I have. We're building a new house. Don't disturb me for 6 months. Go for tuition and study. -This isn't working. I have to use sentiment. What have you done for me, dad? I only want a cycle, dad. This house is for you. Look over there,... ...I'm spending Rs50,000 to build a study room for you. Learn at this age. You can cycle anytime. I don't think my father would agree. Let's try asking mom. Mom, please tell dad. -What did your father tell you? Go! Dad is better. Fine, I'll tell them the school is asking for it. The school wants everyone to cycle to school, dad. The school is nearby. Why do you want a cycle for that? Fine, I'm going to get caught. -Sir! How do you want your hair cut? -Brother, cut in style. Cut short. -Dad! Hey, sit quietly. Dad, this shirt is too loose. Hey, you're still growing. Get it a bit loose. I don't want clothes or firecrackers for Deepavali. Buy me a cycle. -How much do you want me to spend? My father never even bought this for me before. Okay, dad, this shirt is fine. In that area, I was the greatest when it came to cycling. We had a gang that rocked the area. But racing came into my life because of a love affair. I didn't choose Fatimah. Her love took me by storm. Usually, no one would go looking for love. It should happen on its own. It should attack us. It should turn us upside down. Love? -Brother, it's him! What's the matter, brother? Why did you hit me? Bala, Mottai Bala. -Okay. She is my girl. It doesn't matter who started loving her first. Who the girl loves is what matters. She is older than you. -Brother, I am a fan of Simbu. Useless! -He may hit me. I must handle this another way. -It hurts! I admit, I can't hit you. But do you want to race with him? Wait! What? Racing? What do you say, Bala? -Bring your brother's cycle. The girl and the gun are for me. Bala, don't lose to the little boy. -Useless! Ashwin, are you ready? Cycle faster! I'm scared! He slipped. Chase him! Go on, catch him! He's sliding again! Catch him! Mottai, he is fast. Go faster, change the gear. Go on! We don't have to win. Just knock him down! Mottai, knock him! Oh, no! How could you do this, Mottai? There goes my hand! Boss, you rock with a cycle! If you get a motorcycle..... That prompted me to do one thing. First, insert the key. Second, start the engine. First gear. If you release the clutch slowly and press the oil,... ...the motorcycle will move. Go on, that's great! Now, it's in second gear. Be careful. He is riding a motorcycle. How is he doing it? Next, third gear. Hey, great! There is no key and the bike is gone. Oh, no! It's dad! Dad, I can ride a motorcycle now. Buy me one. You wouldn't have touched a motorcycle thereafter. No, one day..... I don't know what the problem is. Hey, wait. Are you still upset I hit you the other day? Boys nowadays only know how to get angry. What if you had fallen? Okay, I can't start the motorcycle. Push it to the workshop. Fix it and push it back here. I know when you need a motorcycle. I'll give it to you then. Okay? Get ready. My father said he would let me use his motorcycle. Really? Next, we'll go on a bike to meet our girl. When we look at some people, we know what we want to be in life. This is Robin, the former TVS racer. Motorcycles, racing and Robin, the man who associates all three... ...in Ashwin's life is Shiva, who works at the mechanic shop. If you want to talk about Mechanic Shiva,... ...a man who is crazy about motorcycles,... ...he is the best mechanic in the area. But, everyone is afraid to come to his workshop. I don't know what he will do this time. Brother, I didn't mean it. Please fix it this time. Do you know how to take care of a motorcycle? This is the heart of the motorcycle. The oil you pour is its blood. -I'm going to die today. Go away. I think the bike has no petrol. I'll push it to the fuel station. I am the best mechanic in this area. I'll know what's wrong with a motorcycle just by touching it. Do you see this vein? Bent down and look. Take a look. This is the choke. Aren't we the same, doctor? You treat people, I treat machines. That's all. Can I display a board that reads, 'Dr. Shiva Mechanic'? Brother, please fix it quickly. It's getting late. I think he doesn't like it. Hey, take a look at this. Brother! -What? He is our boy. I brought him here to work. Tell him to write the names of the board on this board first. I brought him here because he can't read and write. I can only teach you if there is interest. Let's go to Brother Velan's workshop. He will probably ask for a degree. Go, he will make you wash his car. You won't find an engine like this. Learn when there is one. Don't do it to me like you do to other customers. If you do this, I'll quit too. What I've learned is enough. No one is interested to learn. Everyone ran because they couldn't stand his motorcycle madness. No one thought that someone would set foot there... ...with great interest. Brother, I will listen to you. What is this? Come, my baby! I will teach you. Do you know what this is? This is the crank. Do you know what this is? This is a spanner. This is the tank. Although I was annoyed, my whole life... ...was all about motorcycles. Oh, no! I'm late! Luckily there is no one here. Brother, one hour. You were leading. If you stick anything on the wall..... How come the motorcycle I drew is here? Why is he looking? Probably it's his motorcycle. Brother, what is this? -Pressure checker. This? -Filter. This? -Turbo silencer. This? Why is this small? What is this? -It's really hard. Tell me, brother. Where did you go? Hey, wait. -Brother! He is troublesome. Why are you so interested in motorcycles? Do you want to be a big mechanic like me? Brother, I am only interested in racing. You don't know the value of mechanics. Shall I tell my friend and include you in Moto GP? Brother, can we join? Will your father pay for your training? Okay, brother, I will ask him. What, sir? What do you want to ask me today? I don't want a motorcycle, dad. You finally realised what I am going through. Can I go to a motorcycle race coach after 10th Grade? What are you talking about? Motorcycle racing? That's sports too, dad. -You're doing your 10th now. This is the age to study. You can play sports anytime. It's after I finish my 10th, dad. We'll see about that later. Go and study now. Hey, silence! Today is the last day of 10th Grade. I do not want to hit anyone. Grade 10 is nothing. Plus 2 will define your life. Okay? You stand up. What is your ambition? I want to be an engineer. -Very good. Next. Teacher, I want to be a film director. Hey, silence! Will you give me a chance? Of course, miss. -Sit down. You stand up. What is your ambition? I want to be a racer in Moto GP, teacher. GP what? Hey, silence! -I want to be... ...motorcycle racer, teacher. I want to be a racer. People are dying in road accidents. And he wants to be a racer. Look at the way he's thinking! Studying is not enough. Tell your father to meet me tomorrow. He is always fantasising about his bikes. He has stickers on his notebooks and hands. His future is over. Do you pay attention to him or not? Does he go to tuition or not? -He goes to tuition, ma'am. He has good grades. -What do you mean, sir? 8th Grade students go to 12th Grade tuition. The best tuition for 12th Grade math is in Ashok Nagar. Do you know that I didn't know, madam. -It's my tuition. Enrol him there. He will get good results. She doesn't know anything about motorcycles, dad. Who? She? Keep quiet! She did her MPhil and became a teacher. Are you sure you know better than her? I know you like motorcycles. I will buy it for you. But quit racing and Moto GP from today. You are my only child. -Dad! Hey, come on. This society is the cause of all this. Who is this community? Only four people. 40 people they know. 400 people around them. They get together and ask, "What is your son studying? Is he still jobless after graduation? When is his wedding? No kids yet after marriage? Is your son a doctor or an engineer?" After asking all these, they will go... ...without thinking anything about us. But we think this is life and want to succeed in front of them,... ...without taking any big risks. We live in our comfort zones. In the end, life is like the almond milk my grandpa loved. What about the almond milk that your grandpa loved? My grandpa loved the almond milk my grandma made. Wow! Honey, it's really good. -Don't. He drank almond milk every morning, noon and night. Come on. -One day he fell ill. Dear! The doctor said his diabetes was very high... ...and should stop drinking almond milk. Almond milk! My grandpa begged for some almond milk from my grandma. No. -He bowed and asked her. Just a little. -No. He laid down and asked her. -No! Just before he drew his last breath..... At least give me some now. -No. You will die. Useless! -Dear! You left me! But do you know when he got his almond milk? What do you learn from this? Why does a corpse need 'grandpa's milk? Sorry, almond milk. -No. If we don't get what we want in life at the right time,... ...they are like the almond milk my grandpa loved. Who is this Bhagyaraj? Brother! -Sorry, brother. My life is the same. I saw my father as a hero. In which movie, brother? -Brother! You only had one beer. -Finally, he became my villain. Watch, I will be a villain now. -Why is he drinking like this? Usually, every child sees his father as a hero. What if a father sees his son as a hero? Come on, guys! -Come on! Spin! Come on! -Come on! Come on! Don't give up! Good! He has fallen! Oh, no! Dude, wake up. Pick him up! -Get off! It's okay, dude. He has won. Great! -Why did you tell me to do this? I don't like to bet like this. -Shut up, dude. He's a rookie, but he's showing off before us. Shouldn't we show him who we are? We must show off that we are great in life. Yes! -Hey! The stunt went wrong. Let's race. Brother, I don't race. I didn't ask if you want to race. You must come. What if I don't come? What will you do? Run! Hey, stop! Oh, no! Oh, no! Hey! Come on! Cut! I don't want this scene. -Why? It's fine. No, dude. -You asked for a great scene. As good as this? This is too much for a debut film. Come on! I have lost confidence. You won't make a movie. Time and opportunity will present themselves, dude. No issue. 2 lows and 4 wide angles, the scene will be over. I'm saying this is no scene. Fool! You won't shoot the scene. Brother Shiva called. I want to meet him. Rossi Race is this evening. Don't forget to come. Which horoscope? -Thulam moon sign... ...and Vishakham star. I said don't talk about bikes... ...when he is around, right? -As if he knows anything about it. That's right. I put the 46 sticker because he likes motorcycles. My neighbour fights with me... ...because it is his house number. -Why don't you buy a motorcycle? I asked my father. He doesn't want to get me one. -You must be hard on him. How? -There is a format for that. I'll tell you. The kind that tortures by asking for a motorcycle at home. Type 1. Hunger strike. He doesn't want to eat anything. -I'm hungry. You haven't eaten anything for two days. Eat just a little. I will only eat if you get me a motorcycle. I will buy one for you! -Type 2. Suicide threats. I'm going to jump, dad. -Hey, come on down. I will only come down if you buy me a motorcycle. If I come up, I will kill you. You don't need to kill me, I will jump and die. I will get you a bike. Get down! Will you buy one for me? -Hey, take the stairs! Stairs? -Type 3. Abscond. Come home, son. -No, mom. I won't come home. Just leave it. Is the bike important to you? Are we not important? I don't want my family and the bike. Leave me, I'll go. Don't ruin your life. Listen to me. I'm saying for your good. -There is no motorcycle,... ...what's the use of this life? -Okay, I will buy it for you. A bike, right? Come home. -Will you get one for me? Sure? Yes. Where are you now? -I'm on the terrace, mom. What motorcycle are you going to buy for me? Buy a motorcycle with the word 'mom or dad's gift' and ride it. Is it a new bike? -Yes. Look, he's our junior. He has a new bike. He used the same technique. -The bike is great. Okay, I'll ask my father. Is your neighbour a doctor? The sticker says 'doctor'. -Yes. He is a doctor,... ...his wife is a nurse. Let's go! -You have no respect at all! How long am I to wait, mom? -The tailor took his sweet time. Your father wants the motorcycle, he kept calling me. I have work, mom. -Your father wants to go out. This is why I told you to buy me a motorcycle. I'll tell him to buy you a small motorcycle. I don't want a small motorcycle. I want a sports bike. Why do you want a sports bike? -Mom, I'm in college. You will not understand. -Okay, I'll tell your father. Now, how am I to go? -Follow your friends. They keep telling me to do things just when I am busy. A young man's dream is to ride a motorcycle in style to college. But I'm not the lucky one. Until now, I take the train. My life has not changed. From the housing board, we moved to the house my father built. Mom and dad are not at home... There is no one to stop me... Let's watch a movie... Not this one. Fast And Furious 1. Fast And Furious 2. Fast And Furious 89. Who is calling me now? It's him. Yes, dude? I need a favour. -What? Your father is out? Do you want me to bring the motorcycle? You are my best friend. I'm patient because of the position. Okay, wait. I'll leave in 5 minutes after I watch a movie. A movie in 5 minutes? What movie is that? You won't understand if I tell you. It's Fast And Furious. Put the phone down! He's a pain! Power outage? Great! I'll leave. Where did I leave the key? After 2013, many racers from Tamil Nadu... ...took part in Moto GP. So, racing had lots of exposure. Dude, I will be back. Hi, brother. -Ashwin, did you see that? There was a big incident in our area today. A boy who was doing stunts started showing off. I took Ashwin and gave him a piece of my mind. He got tense and asked Ashwin to race him. Then what happened? -You told him not to race. That's his short film. -Why did you hit me? Oh, no! Crazy! -Forget about him. Look, I'm not stopping you from racing. Everyone is naturally enthusiastic in their youth. We did so many stunts with our bikes at your age. We used to show off. My friend looked like a hero. It was our dream to join Moto GP. He loved a girl. He raced for his love. He went very fast along the old Madras Road. There was a small hole, he slipped and hit the divider. His head split open, he died in front of me in a pool of blood. In an instant, they lifted him in front of my eyes. Brother, I am planning to join professional racing... ...because of you. I will not take part in illegal races. Any chance of participating in Moto GP without my dad's signature? If there was a chance, I would have enrolled you. If I had no money, I could work and earn some money. If this is a normal sport, I'll prove it in the annual meet. My father is ready to pay thousands for some random course. But he doesn't want to give me a chance in the field I like. Boys younger than me are training to be racers. Everyone has a story, Ashwin. Look at me, I went to Malaysia. I worked hard for 5 years to become a race mechanic. They made me stand in line. They gave priority only to the people of their country. Me? I wasted 5 years. I decided to come back to India. But I was still determined. I went to all the races,... ...I even went to Dark Race. That's where I met Robin. I didn't want any part of it. Upon marriage, I opened a workshop. I opened another workshop after having kids. What is Dark Race? -You don't need to know. Now, I prepare racing bikes for these racers. I'm back in the field. It is not necessary to win in our dreams to be successful. If we love and follow our dreams to the end, it means we've won. Do you understand You like motorcycles. Ask your father to get you one. That's what I'm asking him. There is an R3 motorcycle in Yamaha. It's great. Look at it. -Shiva! I'm coming, dude. R3? -What motorcycle is that? Search for it. What is the name of the bike? -R3. Dude, it looks great. It's like the one in Fast And Furious. Fast And Furious? Dude, what's the time? I'm sure the power is back. We have to go. What happened? -I played Fast And Furious. I'm caught! I kept dreaming about you... At dawn, I realised it was just a dream... I became an artist by drawing you at the age of 5... But until now, I do not have you... Once I have you... I'll keep travelling without a stop... I'm so upset... I'll keep travelling without a stop... Both can merge as one... I'll go fast on you... When will I have my break... What will happen... I will surely have you one day... I'll protect you on rainy nights... It doesn't matter if I get wet... I'll be your umbrella... Do not kill me by being elusive... I love you so... Be careful! How do you ride? Dad, I want a motorcycle. -Ashwin, we spoke about this. How am I to afford a motorcycle worth Rs350,000? I could manage a small motorcycle. I have to pay for the house too. Do not disturb me. -You keep saying this. I wanted a gaming computer, but you got me a smaller one... ...for learning. I wanted a mobile phone. You got me a small phone just to talk. I studied the course you wanted, dad. You did not even allow me to participate in any race. I don't even like the paint colour in my room. All that is fine, dad. At least get me this motorcycle. I will not ask you for anything else. Please, dad. -Getting the bike is fine. Your mom won't be able to sit on that motorcycle. Where do you want to speed off with that motorcycle? A motorcycle is only for riding. It's okay if it's a small bike. I don't want any motorcycle, dad. You keep giving excuses. I don't like this life, dad. Get a quote tomorrow. I'll get you a motorcycle. Yes! Hello, dude, my father agreed to buy me a motorcycle. What are you saying? -He told me to get a quote. Great! -Can you go in the morning? We'll go tomorrow. -I'm ever ready! It's common to have attractions at a young age... This attraction for bikes is something new... It adds colour to life... You are my first love... I will travel on you without stopping... A heart so disappointed... I will travel on you without stopping... Both can merge as one... I'll go fast on you... When will I have my break... What will happen... It rains non-stop at this time. -Yes. Why are you soaked to the skin? -Dad, I got a bike quote. I came to give it to you. -Get him a towel. Why are you so wet? Mr. Venkat. -Hello. I was hoping you would become a big person like him. My son Ashwin, sir. -Nice. There is a new motorcycle in the market. He wants to buy it. You have a quote. Show it to him. Yamaha R3 motorcycle. -Okay. It's Yamaha's latest release. This motorcycle looks great. The specs are also good. But you can buy a car for this price. How am I to buy a car, sir? Your son has grown up. It'll be nice to have a car. It's time, Moorthy. Don't think too much, Moorthy. My close friend has a showroom. Come when you're ready. I will introduce you. My dream of 10 years, he killed it with one word. He is a big man. He is saying we shouldn't get this bike. I can't spend unnecessarily. If you want, buy a smaller bike. -I do not want a small bike. So, you're not getting a motorcycle. I don't want it! -What does he want? Dear! -If you want anything,... ...buy with your own money. -What is this? If you want something, buy it with your own money. I'm sure every middle-class youth would have heard that. When we hear that, we realise how dependant... ...we are on our family. Thereafter, I did not ask my father for anything. Life changed as I wanted. Even if I didn't pursue my passion,... ...I found a job after college just as my father wanted. Just when I thought it was my life... ...and it's going to be my rules hereafter,... ...my father had other plans for me. He wanted me to hand over my entire salary to them. Because my father wanted to build another floor for me... ...above our house. It's for..... -Welcome. My son has a job now. -Good. Next is his wedding. -That's right. Great! -Marriage for me so to speak. Great, right? Some things are fixed. We can't break it. If we think failure is permanent... Can we live... I met a young man in my office... ...who was affected by the same parents' society. Hi, glad to meet you. -Hi! We plan to make our wishes come true... ...without our family's knowledge. What if it becomes a problem? -No one will know. What is everyone finds out? -No. What if we get caught? -Impossible. Law Of Crime It happened in the year '92. It happened recently in Mumbai. I will get a motorcycle. We can start the mission. -I have a doubt. If our families find out about the loan and problems arise? No problem, I know someone. Home loan, car loan, personal loan... ...or business loans, we will get it approved for you. You only need to provide two passport-size photos... ...and proof of identification. We will even sign for you. Another important thing. -Sir, the commission..... Run away! 12 divided by 2. So, each has to pay Rs600,000. The samosas are delicious. Are you drinking rose milk? There is no one in the world to stop our will. We can buy everything we want. We'll write a long list. Watch, shoes..... Look at that bike! -We'll buy that too. Hurry! -Sorry, boss. I got a loan. We won't buy the things we wanted once we have money. But we must buy something. Why is he spending unnecessarily? I will be prudent. How much is this? -Rs49,000. Why do you want a camera now? Once we get our bike, you need to take pictures. That's right. After buying a camera, to improve my photography skill,... ...I took pictures of everything beautiful around me. So, I took pictures of flowers and insects,... ...pictures of trees and shrubs. ...I took pictures of the sky and the earth. I took pictures of the train and inside the train too. If we fall in love, we will know easily. Because our vision will be beautiful. Okay, I'll take a photo. A bit more! It's out of focus. Hello! Is it blurry? -Sorry, miss. Don't worry, sit down. It's fine. Photography is my passion. You look beautiful in that angle. No problem. At the next stop,... ...I'll drop you off at the police station. Police station?! Ma'am! -Yes. What do you do? -I work at Mahindra. Show me your ID. Ma'am, you looked beautiful in that angle. Photography is my passion. -Show me your photos. Look. It's beautiful, right? -Is this photography? That's a little blurry. Look at this. Your photos are good, but you got the wrong person. Don't do this again. This is your last chance. She is very strict. Ma'am, you'll look great in this angle. I haven't decided whether to file a complaint or not. Sorry, ma'am. I don't know if it's because I met her,... ...but when we are happy, we know what we want in life. Dude, didn't you buy anything? -No, I want to keep some money... ...in the account for some time and enjoy it. Okay! -I'll get some interest. Here, drink your milk. What are you doing inside? I'm working on a project, mom. -Let me see. Step aside. You can't see it now, I'll you show later. Go on. I wonder what project you're working on. Brother, how much is this? How much is this? -Thank you, brother. Is it a new motorcycle? -It's coming soon. And you're showing off already? Your motorcycle has arrived. They are checking. Is it here? -Yes. Can I see? I'll wait there. -Yes. We feel butterflies in the stomach when... ...a boy expresses his love to his lover. And, when a biker buys his dream bike. New bike, laptop, TV,... ...I'm rocking! Hello! -Hello, I'm Lavanya. Lavanya? -The other day, on the train,... ...photo..... -Yes, what is it, Lavanya? Can I meet you? -Of course. Are you free this Friday? If you ask me, I'll be free any time. Do you know where the police station is in Nungambakkam? What is this? -Hello! Did you say Friday? I have an important job that day. Hello, don't be afraid. There is a coffee shop nearby. Come there. -The coffee shop is fine with me. Can I meet at 6 o'clock? Is 6 pm fine with you? Okay. -Okay, Ashwin. Hi! -Hi! We met only once. Don't get me wrong... ...for wanting to meet you again. -Not at all. I'm sure there is something. Or you wouldn't have called me. How do you know that? Which girl calls a man if there is nothing to do? Don't take it seriously. I was just kidding. So, what do you want me to do? -I want revenge on someone. Revenge? -Yes. I'm studying at SRM now. My dream is to become a news presenter at the BBC. I applied to a local channel for an internship. Over there..... The hero will help the heroine. They will fall in love. In Tamil cinema..... -How else to film a love scene? It's okay, sir. Someone is here to see you. Vanakkam. -Vanakkam, sir. My name is Lavanya. Mr. Nitharsanam sent me. Head of IT. -Yes, he told me. Do you want to come in the morning or evening? I'll be more comfortable in the morning, sir. I have a request. It will be good if we can promote our local channels in English. It will help college and school students to learn English. So, are you not fluent in Tamil? Do you only know English? -No, sir. I'm not that fluent in Tamil. I will be more comfortable in English. So, look for an English channel and join them. Sir..... -I just told you. Go on. Sir, you're not saying this out of love for the Tamil language,... ...but you're obsessed with the language. Yes, I'm obsessed with Tamil. You can go now! This is why our society is lagging. Sir, you could have told her patiently without getting angry. Come on! Now the BBC Channel dubs their shows... ...so that their people can hear it in their language. If you're born in Russia or Japan,... ...try telling them that you only know English... ...and not good at their language Nowadays people take pride when they say they don't know Tamil. If we don't speak our language, who will? He said it right, but he did not understand my intention. I want this girl to change to this in society. Great! -Everything is 'great' for him. How do we take revenge on him? I want to make a travelogue in Tamil. You said you were interested in cinematography Am I right? -Yes. Can we make a travelogue? -Sure. I will let you know next week after planning. Okay. -Great! I feel like I have everything in life now. But something is bothering me. My parents don't know all this. Either I convince them or I have to convince myself. Dude, I was counting on you. Say something. Don't worry. With the idea I give,... ...your father, like the father in 7G Rainbow Colony,... ..."Hey, there's something in him too. Yamaha motorcycles are no joke. My son is a great street racer." He's going to say this... ...in his sleep. You have to do something about that. I have all the father and son sentimental scenes... ...from all the Tamil movies. Watch this. "What did I do wrong?" "You did all the mistakes." "I sent you to school." "What did you make me study? Will you make me a doctor like Saravanan's father? I studied BA in college." "Call everyone and say that when you went to school....." Memorise all these dialogues, edit them and say them at home. There will fight tonight. -Hey! This fool! Take him away. I have a short film to record tomorrow. The scene will shock you. You made all the mistakes. I shall say it today. Oh, no! -Okay. Look at the time he gets home. Is this the time to come home? Hey, cool. Say all the dialogues. -What are you thinking? Dad, I was at my friend's house. -You're always with friends. Whose motorcycle is this? -Hey, tell him! It belongs to my friend, dad. We used to feel shy to ask people for anything. Dad! My friend is going back to the village for a week. He told me to keep an eye on it. -Is that so? This motorcycle looks good. -Yes, dad. It's a nice colour too. -Yes, dad. It suits you. -Thank you, dad. How much is it? -Rs350,000, dad. What a waste! Can I take a loan in your name? -Dad, I haven't taken any loan. Hey, I only asked if I could use your name to take a loan. I want to finish the house renovation. What are you thinking? All this is for you. It's for your home. Sure, dad. I've taken a loan, dad. I'm dead! Borrowing money is not an issue. In your office, our contacts,... ...I'm sure there is someone who gives loans for interest. Make a pitiful face, "There has been an emergency. I will pay you back." Ask for it. You will get it. Ask for it. Don't be bad and think too much about this. I can borrow some from the office and outside and manage. He got it. There is an emergency. -Great. I'm in trouble. -Extraordinary. I will return it next month. Please try to raise Rs100,000. -What is this? Don't say you have no money. How can you ask me? -Dude, arrange the money for me. I had Rs10 in my pocket, I was looking for it because it's gone. Brother, I asked you for some money. I give for low interest because I know you. It's only 10 paise. -What does that mean? Just Rs10,000 for a Rs100,000 loan. Rs10,000?! What is this? Don't you want it? This is the lowest. My leg hurts. I need a massage. Dude, you must do an important favour for me. We took a loan together. Won't I help? Ask me what you want. I want Rs300,000. -Once again? I was caught at home. I'm in a fix. Okay. -You took a loan, right? If you give me Rs300,000..... -He plans to empty my account. I will take care of the rest. -I must 'unfriend' him. Hey, wait! Your job is not fixed yet, why are you playing around here? I borrowed Rs300,000 from Nirmal. You said you'll give me Rs80,000. -Money is not a problem. Please return it on the 10th. -Okay, buddy. I'm scared when I think about my trainer. Brother, your job is fixed. How is the trainer? Do you know English? -I'm going to lose this job! Look at this document, sir. -No, I didn't ask for this. This one? -Not this either. I wanted something else. Look at this. -Not this either. You prepare again. -Now I get it. What infotainment facilities can I find in this car? This car has Android Auto... ...and fully automatic. -Gearbox too? There is manual too, sir. -Great. All digital meters. Sir, you can try it. Fantastic! Sir, may I answer this call? -Go ahead. I just came to see it. Hello? -You can have it tomorrow. Collect it in the evening. -I will return... ...in 3 months, sir. -Hello? Sorry sir. Dad! -Yes? The Rs600,000 loan I took is in your account. Thanks, I've seen it. A loan for your father? Is there anything for me? For you? Only my live left. After borrowing money for my family,... ...I thought my problems would be over. But the real problems started thereafter. Because I give my salary to my family,... ...to pay the interest on my loan, I had to take up a part-time job. Hello! Madam, I have come to the location. Brother, you must pay the interest on the 5th. You promise to pay today. -I couldn't focus on anything. Nothing was right. I borrowed from many people. I have to pay many people. I must hide this from my family. Many problems like this. I felt like I did something wrong. Who does not have problems in life? Loan problems, problems at home,... ...problems at work and problems with passion. Although we have many problems like this tormenting us,... ...when the girl we love is with us,... ...our problems will become minute. When I'm with him, I feel light. We started our vlog. I feel like I want to be with him all the time. Hey, girl... Hey, girl... Hey, girl... Great! At first, we were just friends,... ...until I saw love in her eyes. I'm floating on this wind... I lost in you unconsciously... Like fresh rain from the sky... In my life... I get soaked... When I see you tirelessly... I don't want to leave you for even a second... This love is in my heart... Something happened to my life... I ask you... Hey girl, something happened to me because of you... Hey girl, something happened to me because of you... Hey girl, something happened to me because of you... Hey girl, something happened to me because of you... Where is Ashwin? Why are you so anxious like in the movie Hari? Our troubles will end today. How? -There is a bike race... ...in our area. If Ashwin wins the race,... ...we will get Rs1 million. -So, will I get my Rs300,000? But there is one small problem. -What is that? The entry fee is Rs50,000. -Come on! Dude! -He'll ask me for that money. He will win. This won't work, dude. -He's a good racer. Have you ever seen it? Look at the way he is sitting. We gave him the money, it's stressful for us. He listened to music with pleasure. The biggest mistake I made was to take a loan with him. Oh, no! He is looking at us. -What is it? Ashwin, shall we go and eat? -Forget it. There is a street race in my area. My friend is organising it. If you take part in it, you will surely win. No, that's unprofessional. It's not suitable for me. What a relief! I escaped. Don't annoy me. -I want it to remain Rs300,000. Don't make it Rs350,000. -There is something more serious. What is it? -There is a team meeting today. I'm worried, I don't know what our trainer will say. What are you talking about? -Sir? So, you guys are not working. We will go now. -What are you talking about? Tell me. Let's discuss. Come on. So if he goes for the street race, you'll get your money back. Yes, sir. -Why don't you want to go? Sir, street racing is unprofessional. There are professional street races, do you know that? When I was working in Delhi, a colleague of mine... ...told me about Pro Street racing. All over the world, there are many accidents... ...due to illegal racing. To prevent such accidents... ...and to create a platform for street racers,... ...a biker community organises a legal bike race... ...named Pro Street. Some countries do have races like this. Like Drag Racing and Motocross. But Pro Street organises this bike race worldwide. Even in India, this race was held in North India. Next year, it will be held in South India too. But not every racer can take part in this race. You can take part only if a certified coach signs the form. I said what I knew. You know what to do next. Brother, you can if you want. If Robin... ...signs the form, I can join Pro Street. Try talking to him. He will listen to you. You have a job now. Go and do your work. Do you know what is the hardest thing in the world? Are you saying my dialogue? -Try talking to him. He won't let me go. Okay, I'll talk to him. Go now. Yes! Thanks, brother. Yes! -Crazy! What is your experience in racing? I'm not saying this to discourage you. Because I don't want anything to happen to you. Even professionals can get injured. In fact, you can even lose your life. Besides, you should practice from childhood. You can't do anything big at this level. I did not take part in even a small race. But after finding out there is a professional street race,... ...I finally have some hope. My dad said this when I was small. "You can only learn at this age. You can do whatever you like whenever you want." But I just found out, what we like is the lesson we need. I have no desire to win in this. But I want to prove something. You can do it if you want. -We'll see. I will be ready soon. I'll tell you when I'm done. -Okay. Please go ahead. Thank you. Have you read everything? -Yes sir. Usually, we don't allow riders we don't know. Robin is my best friend. I'm allowing you because... ...you are his student. I'm sure you know about this race. But I'll tell you the rules once again. In this Pro Street race, there is a trial for 6 months. 5 km per trial. A rider gets two chances. Only bikes with 300 to 600 cc are allowed. The top five trials timing will be selected for the finals. After the trials, the finals... ...will take place in Yerkadu after three months. Hope to see you in the finals. -Thank you, sir. Hello, sir. -Hi, Sam. Do you think we can't participate... ...in this race without your permission? You must have seen my name on the list. My intention is not to stop you from participating. There is a black mark on your name in the association... ...for illegal racing. -That's my wish, sir. If you organise according to the law,... ...why would I want to take part in illegal racing? Maybe because of people like you, it is not legalised. I will teach you a lesson one day. Chill, sir. -Asraf! Just a second. Okay, Ashwin. Submit this application to him. Okay, sir. -Who is this, sir? Your student? There is a trainer named Robin in Bangalore. He is his student. Okay, guys. Hi, brother. -Hi! Are you a track racer? -Yes, brother. I raced under 16. I've never seen you on any tracks. -No, I raced under 16. No, I know everyone in the group. I've never seen you before. I like racing. This is my first race. Are you a racer, brother? Three-time champion. -Three times? You don't look like a racer, brother. How do I look then? -I didn't mean it that way. Move! What are you looking? -Sam! Hey, let it be. We will see him in the race. Hey, you're riding fast. Focus! Don't get nervous. Focus! Focus! Hey! What is this? You have ruined everything. You missed the first chance. It's here. -He is sitting here looking sad. There is a tree branch on the track. I avoided it. We knew about it. -I put it there. He is a new rider. He got stuck. Rider, are you stuck? I wanted to tell you something. Why race when you don't even know how to ride a bike? Because enthusiasts like you fall and die,... ...everyone is afraid of racing. Go and do a job that is suitable for you. Go on. You can't see a racer by his looks, you only know when he rides. We must beat him, dude. -He's not worth it. People will keep saying things. It's true what he said. Okay, let it go, Ashwin. Go home now. What is this, brother? -What do you mean? We can talk easily that we like something. Prove that you're the best at it,... ...make sure no one works harder than you. How did you struggle for the sake of racing? Practice properly. How long do you have before the trial? We have six months -Six months, right? I will talk to Robin. Go and practice with him. Okay? -Sure. He is saying there are only 6 months left. I don't know what Robin will say. I got you late. We must practice well. Okay, Robin. Ashwin, he has agreed. But he said you must wait for 2 months. I think he is busy. But we have 4 months. Is it okay with you? Okay, brother. From today, I am your coach. Our relationship is like a bike and its brakes. First, start. Ready. Go! Second, bend. Always start the corner on the inside and finish on the outside. Do you understand? Reaction time is very important in racing. The focus should be here. In a split second, you will lose your lead. Again. Straight-line speed alone is not a skill. When negotiating a corner, you must know when to hit the brakes. One more lap. Then, you must go back to the right racing lane. Again! Bend! Bend! You must find the balance between your cornering and braking. This is not something you can achieve in 2-3 days. This technique will be effective when you both get connected. Position. Are you ready? Go! It doesn't matter how long you practice. How quickly you get to form is important. One can practice for years,... ...but how quickly he gets to form is only in his hands. Anything can happen in a racing situation. You have to adopt the race space and difference. You will learn that on the battlefield called track. What is wrong with you? -I don't know what to do. My trainer will surely fire me. Please pay me back the Rs80,000 you took from me. Wait. I will return it as soon as possible. Give me some time. -Am I just unlucky? So, you want to join the bike race to solve all your problems? Yes, friend. -How much will you get if you win? Rs1 million. Rs1 million?! -But they want Rs50,000 for entry. Find a way to win. We'll pay him first. Who? It's my money. I gave you Rs100,000. I'll pay you back. -I'm just kidding. I'm just reminding you. You were telling me about the street race. When is that? You just agree, that's all. We will do the rest. You said you wouldn't participate in any street race. What happened now? Street race is also a sport. Promote it by following the rules and regulations,... ...you will know how many talented racers there are in our country. The platform will not get created on its own. A generation must start it. Look how fast they are. If you ask them, they will say they are racers. No, racers won't show off on the road like this. They will only show their skills on the track. When do you want to talk about your dream? Dude, we have to go at 8 tonight to pick up the form. Okay, buddy. I'm here for delivery now. I call you again. -Okay. Brother, I am at the location. But this looks like a forest. Do you see the truck? -Yes. Can you see the smoke? Come there. -Who could it be? Do you have the street race form? -There is no form. What is this? -One minute, dude. Don't you have the street race form? No, brother. There is no form. -Brother, here, talk to him. Hello! Yes, dude. Okay, I will give him. Brother! You could have told me you are Jerald's friend. Thank you, brother. -All the best. Got it. Will I get selected? -Come on, we'll take care of it. There is no problem that will change on its own. If there is a small change in us, we can change. Feeling positive. It's fine now. It's enough if the coach says okay. Coach, there is a street racing tournament. I want to participate in it. No. If I participate in it, it can be an exercise. I do not encourage street racing. But, if you want to participate, you have that freedom. He is my friend. He did everything. Thank you, brother. -It's okay, brother. He said you are a racer. How can I not help another racer? Are you a racer too? -I'm not a racer, I'm a bettor. What does that mean? -Whenever there is... ...a street race, I'll pick a good racer... ...and place my bet on him. We win without racing. Are there many races like this? Who organises them? -He is asking so many questions. How many races have you been in? -This is my first race. Thank God you told me. -Why, brother? I wanted to bet on you. You said he was a great racer. He's really good. -When did you see him race? Racing is progressing very fast. Leave that alone, brother. Who organises these events? What are the rules? -He is asking so many questions. There is a gang in my area. Just like football and cricket tournaments,... ...we organise a bike tournament every once a year. Not everyone can take part in the race. Only good riders known to our circle will be given a chance. We do not organise it just like that. We have our supporters. With the permission of social activists and VIPs in our area,... ...we organise these races. They support us because we follow the rules and regulations. We block the roads properly and even have an ambulance ready. We do it properly. This is the seventh year we are organising this race. Motorcycles up to 200 cc are allowed. You only want 200 cc, right? I prepared this myself. Try riding it. 100 riders like you have taken this entry form. We will divide them into groups and based on the best time,... ...we will choose 25 racers. Dude, the best timing list is out. You have been chosen. The 25 riders will be divided into 5 groups... ...and the quarter-finals are held. The quarter-final winners will be divided into two... ...and the semi-finals are held. The winners of the semi-finals... ...will advance to the finals. The person who wins the finals is the winner. Okay, brother. Practice well. See you on race day. Give the bread to him. We are organising this for the seventh time. Make sure there are no problems this year too. Hey! -It's okay, brother. We will manage. It's great if you win! -If you win,... ...I will get my money back! I'm only asking for my money back. Hey, there are so many racers here! Dude, you will win! -Dude, you will win! Come on, dude, I will wait for you at the finishing line. A world with evil intentions... Will hurt you with harsh words... Days will burn you like fire... Do not be sad... You will shine soon... Go boldly... Focus on the goal... Go fast... Go by splitting the sky... Go boldly... Focus on the goal... Go fast... Go by splitting the sky... Come on, friends! He has won! One race just ended. The next race is on the 8th. The next race is on the 12th. The following races are on the 15th... ...and the 20th. Then, it is the semi-finals. Before that, my friend said he wanted to see you. I guessed wrong. You ride well. The boys looked at your timing and asked me who you are. I have seen the schedule. You're in the second semi-finals. The first semi-finals is on the 2nd. The second semi-finals is just a week away. There is still time. Practice well. You can win. If there is anything, call me. You didn't do anything wrong to fear. You can wish for anything that doesn't affect others. The world will resist change. If you advance, it will try to break you. If you fall, it will try to step on you. People tell you not to dream of flying. Heights are scary, but not for eagles. It's ready. Dude, is everything okay? We can win, right? I told you, right? It's him. You take the left and I'll take the right. We will crush him. We will fix him. Life is not just a journey... For a leisurely walk... Your day is not far... To carve your name... The town will laugh thinking you are useless... Don't believe them and be sad... Don't think about criticism... Fight for your day... Find your goal... Tell me what you need... Even if the town is against you... Even if you stop yourself... Don't hesitate to advance... Go boldly... Focus on the goal... Go fast... Go by splitting the sky... Go boldly... Focus on the goal... Go fast... Go by splitting the sky... Brother? -Hey! Can I keep this in the workshop? -Sure. I hope you are happy. You tell me everything, but you do not talk about your dreams. Wait, I will tell you soon. Okay, leave it at that. I've planned a surprise for you. I called to talk about it. Look at this. The under-16 champion is here. Hello! -He delivers food on an R3 bike. He is an expensive delivery boy. What are you looking at? I should have smacked you for looking at me the other day. You are doing the work that suits you. What? Are you angry? Do you feel like hitting me? Come with this rage, we'll race. Say yes! If you lose, hand over your bike to me. Dude, he would have taken a loan to buy the bike. Poor thing. We're late for the movie. Let's go. Get lost! What is this? Okay, I'll take care of it. Coach, I think I'm ready. For what? -If I raced with Sam,... ...I will surely beat him. -Not now, Ashwin. Why, coach? Aren't you confident that I'll win? What did you tell me when you first came? I want to participate in the 'Pro Street' race. So, why do you want to win him? Not just you. Many people do this in life. They forget why they start something,... ...they compete with unnecessary people... ...and think of winning them as a goal. That is not a dream, but ego. Life is nothing with ego. You don't have to win anyone. Race to win yourself. Just give it a thought. He is right. I handled life coolly for some time without thinking about anything. From time to time, there were lots of love too. Hello? -Where are you? I had a dream yesterday. We went on a long ride. The chill sky... It's a love journey... At night... You and me... When it rains... We get soaked... Your love controls me... I'm lost in you... Beautiful, in your thoughts... I realised I'm in love with you... My love, with your light... I'm wide awake at night... Beautiful, in your thoughts... I realised I'm in love with you... My love, with your light... I'm wide awake at night... Trees on either side of the road... They create the right ambiance... Your gaze makes me intoxicated... I fall deeper in love... Your curves... Even the rainbow would lose to you... When you speak softly... My heart shines like the moon... The affects of nature... I'd say beauty is dangerous... But I'm with one such beauty... I lie on her lap every day... Beautiful, in your thoughts... I realised I'm in love with you... My love, with your light... I'm wide awake at night... My anger at Sam did not subside. But now, I know where to show that anger. Route clear. Over! It's so noisy! What is this? There's a car coming! I'm dead! Hello! A car is passing! I don't know if they heard me. Yeah! Yes! I only thought about my father at that time. From today, leave this racing and Moto GP. I only have one son. Hello, coach. -Hi, Ashwin. Are you free on the 16th? Yes, coach. -Congratulations, Ashwin. You qualified with the best time in the trials. You have been selected for the 'Pro Street' finals. Congratulations! Good job. I feel very happy. -Thank you, coach. So, are you ready for the final race? Coach, can I talk to my family and let you know? All right, talk to them. Okay. This is the right time. I'll tell him. Dad! I wanted to say something important to you the past 2 days. I wanted to talk to you too. Come on, sit down. I gave two photos to mom. What photos, dad? -The girl is from our village. Her family is well-off. We like the girl very much. Time flies. You are getting married. Hereafter, it's your life. You can live as you please. Why do you look dull? -No, dad. Nothing. Viji! -Yes? Ask what your son wants. Go on. Boy! -Dad? You said you wanted to say something. It's okay, dad. Once I have a grandson, my responsibility will be over. How do I tell my father? Try using sentiment. -He has planned everything. Try talking to your mom. -That won't work, dude. She only listens to my father. -You know that. Then why are you torturing me? There are problems after problems. We must visit our ancestral temple. Mom? -I don't feel nice. We saw an astrologer, he said your timing is bad... ...the next 3 months. Have you returned the bike to your friend? Yes, mom. -Be careful when you do things. I forgot I left the milk to boil. -Mom! The time is so bad. -This is not going to work. Sometimes we decide and fail. The pain is not as bad... ...as the opportunity forgone. Many people would have experienced this. But I don't know what will happen in my life. 19th. We will meet the bride on the 19th. What is he looking at for so long? I can't see anything. Okay, I'll ask him. Why are you so stressed? Treat the race as a dream and forget about it. Start a new life as your family said. What am I to leave? Is this a dream... ...to forget once I wake up? This has been my dream since childhood. When the clothes and the things we order... ...do not suit us, we feel dissatisfied. Yes. Bike is my joy, being a bike racer is my dream. If I can't live that, how can I start a new life happily? Who are we? -Who does he mean? Who are the people here? No one knows who we are, what we do and why we are here. Everyone can live as happily as they want,... ...but we are all trapped in one boundary without freedom. Can you assure me that I will get another chance at life? You can't, right? I only get this one life. I want to live the way I want. Okay, buddy. You tell this to your father. That is what I can't do. It's okay, dude. But that was a lengthy dialogue. Ashwin, are you nervous? -Yes. What did you tell your family? -I didn't tell them, coach. How then? It got me thinking. Who should I tell at this time? You said you wanted to talk about your dreams. But you are silent now. -I want to tell you,... ...but I'm hesitant. I don't know if you will accept it or not. It's okay, just tell me what it is. I aspire to be a Moto GP racer. But my family did not support me. So I couldn't pursue further. I just got the chance to participate... ...in a professional street race championship. Anything can happen. I could even lose my life. I don't want to race for the rest of my life. But I want you to be with me for the rest of my life. So, if you say no, I will not participate. I will be with you for the rest of your life. But, I will not decide what you can and cannot do. Real love is to love you and your passion. When you go racing, I hope you remember that... ...I'll be waiting for you. Fine, but why didn't your family support you? They are like every other parent. In the name of sacrificing their lives for us,... ...they aspire to take us to a better level,... ...they end up making us sacrifice our dreams. I don't understand who benefits from this. I must do something for my dream. Dude, I heard he has the best time in the trials. He's just a boy. Getting the best time in the trials is no big deal. Take a look at the finals Pro Street sponsored this because you had the fastest time... ...in the trials. Get ready. Coach, let me make a call. -Okay. We only meet when there is a ceremony. How is your father? -He is fine. We only spoke on the phone. In which college is your daughter studying? She's not in college, she is still in school. She is a big girl now. Which school do you study in? Hey, he's asking you. -It's not a school. I attend motor sports training. -What is she doing? This is her father's idea. She wants to be a bike racer. So he put her in a motor sports training school. What about school and exams? -I do it online. Times have changed. Ashwin is the same. He keeps talking about... ...cars, motorcycles and racing. But I'm afraid of it. I did not allow him to pursue it. Look, talk about the devil and the devil is calling. Hello? -Are you home? Yes. Sister Sathya and her daughter are here. We are talking about you. -Oh! Okay, dad. How is your work? -Dad, I want to say... ...something important to you. What is it? -I want to say something important. Tell me. I love a girl. -What? I love a girl, dad. No matter what it is, come home and we'll talk. Mom, there is no internet here. Let's go home, mom. -Wait for a while. Why do you look so upset? It's nothing. -Let's go, mom. When can we leave? There is no connection here. -What is she saying? She can't seem to connect to the internet. She wants a computer. -Computer? We have one at home. He is busy with his project, he keeps his room locked. What? Did he lock his room? I have a key. Wow! Grandpa is the best father. Look, mom. Grandpa has bought so much for his son. He said it was a project. It's time. Uncle, as you said, Ashwin loves bikes too. Mom, come here. This is the live race I was talking about. It's happening for the first time in India, that too in Tamil Nadu. Independent Pro Street Race. It's by a community called, Pro Street Racing Federation. Not just the Moto GP racing, to highlight... ...other talented local racers,... ...they hold many competitions around the world. Now this is happening in our country. Their races are broadcast through live streaming online. As far as I know, all the bikers and fans will be watching this. Why doesn't anyone know about this? Mom, this is not a movie to promote. This is the life of bikers. It has already started and this is going to be fun. Mic 3? -Check. Over! Route 5, clear. -No, a car just passed. Check over. Everything is under control. If you want to be a star in the sky... You must dare to cross the sky... Even when the world was against you... You must dare to achieve your goal... Anyone born... There is no limit to their abilities... In this way of life... Desires become dreams... There is no one to stop you when you realise... I kept walking even though I knew it was fire... Life is only once... My life is only once... I don't care about death... I will achieve my goal... My life is only once... Life is only once... Just once... Hey! Dear! Hello? -Your father grabbed his chest... ...and collapsed. I don't know what to do. Where are you? Come fast. This house is for you. Look, I'm spending Rs50,000 to build you a study room. I was hoping you become like this man. Viji, serve your son. Go on. Dude, dad had a heart attack. It's nothing. Let's go and see him. -I don't know how to face this. And I told him about my love. Let's go. Give me your bag. Come on. I don't want this bike or this race. Family is important. I don't know what to do. No matter what, we'll go there and discuss. Come on. I don't know how to face them. -It's fine. Come on. Mom, how is dad now? -You said you had a project,... ...you deceive everyone. -I'm sorry, mom. How is dad have a heart attack? -What? Heart attack? Go on, he is inside. He only held his chest. You said he has a heart attack. -Hey, come on. When I see the bill, I'm afraid I'll get a heart attack. It's hard. Hey, do you race too? -I don't race, dad. I'm only in love. -Hey, don't lie. Did you rush here thinking something had happened to me? I've become a bad person that you had to hide your desires. Not so, father. -Come on! Yesterday, I was amazed at what Sathya said. You've been talking about bikes since childhood. I don't understand anything. Our lives were different. Did I do something wrong? Okay, buy the biggest bike available. You can take part in any race in the world. But if something happens to you and you die,... ...we will go back to the village. I'll sit next to a stranger and say,... ..."I was born into a poor family, I studied hard,... ...separated from family, I lived in the city. Then I got married and gave birth to my only son. And I had big dreams for him. But he said he only likes motorcycles. Because I let him follow his will,... ...today he is not by my side. If I was strict, if I had told you that this is not for us,... ...he might be with me today. I won't say that, my son! Dad? -Hey! I only have one child. Forget about racing! You said you were in love with a girl. Let's go and see her. -Okay, dad. Go on. Can I write a message that the middle class will not change? And they must succeed in this environment. No need. Let's go. -He is not letting me perform. Hello? -Yes? What happened? No problem, right? Nothing. Low blood pressure. Did you see my son? How does he look? Didn't I ride sophisticated bikes too when I was younger? This is not a huge success. But every startup... ...does not need a big success. As Brother Shiva had said,... ...it's not necessarily for us to win our passion to succeed. If we love and follow our passion to the end,... ...it means we have won. Look ahead... There are a thousand ways... Choose one for you... Don't listen to people... ...and lose your way... Don't ask questions... You have all the answers inside you... Every obstacle you face... Consider it your destiny... The stone that doesn't bear pain... Won't be a statue... You've won the championship. I lost the other day. Let's race again. I don't race one-on-one. Brother, what is Dark Race? Every story you see... Trust it is the way for you... I don't want to live... ...and die like a glass fish... I must live forever... ...like a star in the sky... Life is only once... Why so many rules here... Do not pretend for anyone... Live for yourself... Life is only once... Why so many rules here... Don't pretend for anyone... Live for yourself...
