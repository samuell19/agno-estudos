[MUSIC PLAYING] There are so many reasons why people come out here. People come here to escape something. People come out here to find something. People come out to prove something. People come out here to lose something. [MUSIC PLAYING] Back in 1975, I read Eric Ryback's book, the guy who walked from Canada to Mexico, the first guy to do it wearing a 75 pound Kelty pack and the heavy mountaineering boots and the Levi's jeans. I read his book and I wanted to be Eric Ryback. That dream kind of stayed with me. Being from San Diego, the trail starts in my backyard. And in my 20s, I walked north to Mount Laguna. At that time there was no trail. At that time, it was the temporary PCT, which meant that we were walking fire roads. We were walking Forest Service roads. We were walking through the Indian reservation. So it was quite easy to get lost. So I actually started when there was a trail, but there was no trail. Unfortunately, life got in the way. I got married, had 2.4 kids, have a career, have a house, have a mortgage payment, have a lovely wife. And about age 35, the trail kind of became a little more urgent. When I hit my 35th birthday, I decided that I'm halfway to 70. And that was scary, because I don't get those years back. I've got to make wise use of what I have. When I was in university, I had to keep a journal as part of a class. And one of the things that I stuck in there was 10 things I wanted to do before I was 65. And one of the things was hiking the Appalachian Trail. Then after some time, I got to thinking about it and I really didn't want to hit the Appalachian Trail. I needed mountains. And so I didn't feel like I'd get out of the Appalachian Trail, so I switched to this. And then it was just kind of it turned into just one of those things that needed to be done in life. And my job ended last year at the right time to start the trail. And then I had to drop off. And then this time, once again, my job ended at just the right time to start. And although I should probably have kept working, it was at the right time. And timing is more valuable than money, even with the economic downturn. I was working in Geneva for the UN. And I flew in to Portland, had my parents send a backpack down from Alaska. Picked up a few things from the guy I hiked with last year. And headed to the kickoff. And within one week from Geneva, I was sitting at the kickoff. [CHATTER] I was looking for a grand adventure. And the Appalachian Trail is a little too populated. The Continental Divide is a little too crazy. And this was just about right. So I chose this one. I was at a point in my life when I had decided like I want to take the coolest things, the gnarliest thing that I hear about, I just want to make it a reality in my life. In my life, in my daily life, there's always this feeling of like a little bit of discontentment. And when I come out here I-- not that there's anything wrong with the worldly world, but I feel that I'm not doing enough and I'm always placing all this judgment on myself. When I'm out here, and I feel fine. I think this is how I rejuvenate. [MUSIC PLAYING] About five years ago, I had got a bad diagnosis, which kind of surprised. Until that time, you always assume that, you know, there's plenty of time to do the things that you want to do. And, oftentimes, as I discovered, we don't always have the same-- we don't realize what's really important to us. And that actually was a valuable opportunity for me, because I was told basically that I needed to get my affairs in order. And so, I'm a lawyer. We're always bad. We'd never make wills, OK? So I had to go out and make a will and did a trust for my kids. And right after that, I was lying at home at night and I was staring at the ceiling, and the one thing that popped into my head was the Pacific Crest Trail. I mean I would urge anyone and everyone to come out and experience the trial and not delay until too long those things that would really satisfy you as a human being. This is stuff that people talk about their whole lives, basically, and then they hope to do once they're 65 and retired. And I mean both of our philosophies are just-- and it kind of depends where you are, your position in life, obviously, if you're single, married, have kids and everything, this all changes. But for us, just planning the things and doing them, because you just never know. Tomorrow is not promised to anybody. I mean anything could happen. And chance you take by trying to put stuff off too long. I wanted to have this crazy experience to build the rest of my life not so much around, but this is looking back, I know it's going to be a focal point in my life. Now I just see things so differently. This trail has a way of taking your measure to measure what you've got in you, that you can't any other way. I wanted to take the PCT, because I kind of felt-- even know I was having a good time back home-- I kind of like I haven't done anything big. Like I didn't feel like I was having any really big accomplishments in my life. And I kind of wanting to feel like I can do something big. I hiked the Appalachian Trail two years ago in honor of a friend who got killed, actually. I figured he'd want to do this one after the AT. So I'm carrying his ashes again on this trip. And figured this would be a good thing to do. When I was seriously considering doing the hike, I knew that I wanted to do it for a charity. Because I figured, you know what? Five months is a long time to just be doing something for yourself. Even though it's a cool thing to be doing for yourself, I just wanted to take it a little bit-- I wanted to put it to good use, basically. The Lance Armstrong Foundation being a logical choice for me considering my background, which I had cancer-- I had got it in 2004, but it wasn't diagnosed until February of 2005. For the better part of the next year, I went through two surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation, the whole gamut. But what it did is it just kind of refocused my life and kind of gave me purpose. Not that I didn't have it before, but it just kind of crystallized things. And so it was kind of like a growing up moment. It was kind of an aha moment. And from that point forward, I've just been rocking and rolling, enjoying life as much as I can, and living the dream. [MUSIC PLAYING] It's hard to leave that security of your job and family. But just you've got to do it. I mean daydreaming about it is not going to make it happen. So it's better just to come out and give it a shot. You'll learn as you're hiking. There's a lot of people out here with a lot of knowledge and skills. And just do a little research for gear. You should be fine. I've never had like a serious backpack on my back ever before. The most I'd ever done is car camping and you take like a school backpack, throw some granola bars and a water bottle or two in there and just go on like a five mile loop. So PCT puts you in the shape that you need to be in. You know, I actually lived near the Appalachian Trail in Georgia. And I'd try to get out and hike on that when I could. You know, I did some reading and that's about it. My training regimen was gaining weight. So I just sat around for a month and ate. And I've lost all that. So-- We've never hiked before ever. When we started planning-- I think we hiked one five mile. One eight mile hike. OK. We can walk together. Don't go with someone you don't know. But it's working pretty well. We have the same pace. We like the same kind of food. One of the blessings and curses of being a through hiker is being forced to learn to be flexible. I actually had every day planned out-- how far I was going to hike, where I was going to camp-- from the Mexican border to Kennedy Meadows, which is 702 miles in. And we threw that plan out after the first day, literally after the first day. You can try to plan all you want. And most of the time, it doesn't work out. Don't plan squat. We planned for months and got out here and found out most of our planning was completely wrong. I planned quite a bit. And that plan went out the window day one. Whenever, he sewed our tarp and made our sleeping quilt and a lot of duty bags. And I prepared a lot of dehydrated foods. Too much planning, too much preparation, kind of takes the fun and spontaneity out of the adventure. I did a little bit of research, but it was minimal, on the equipment side. I'd been studying the trail for years. So I walked into the REI up in Portland about literally three days before I got on the plane to fly down to San Diego to start the trail and bought my gear. And so it was kind of-- I don't know, there was no dry run. There was no testing out the equipment to make sure it all worked. It was just kind of like a leap of faith. I didn't know I was going to do this until like march and so I just sort of trusted that like, you know, I'd just kind of learn as I went. And it's worked out really well. And I feel less stressed like I didn't spend a ton of time trying to put food together and sending it. I've just resupplied in towns and it works out fine. I have a bunch of equipment and gear at a friend's house. And so I'll just call him and he'll send it to me. And everything else I just get on the trail, like the food. I just resupply along the way. So I don't need to send myself any food. [MUSIC PLAYING] The kindness of strangers has been incredible. A lot of people have opened their hearts and stuff to us, which is very foreign to me. I'm not really used to that, at least from strangers. And so it's kind of sort of renewed my faith in humanity, which is nice. You know, most people, most towns you come to are just very welcoming and very happy to see hikers. The last town I came through, people were gracious. People were happy to see us. People, I find, are very accommodating when they realize what you're doing. And I think a lot more people would like to be out on the trail than actually are. And when you meet people that have an interest in what you're doing, it makes, one, your trip a little bit more bearable, and, secondly, you have this connection with people. You'll have this connection with folks in that town that don't see you as a threat, don't see you as a dirty, stinky hiker who's a bum, and who's just looking to get whatever he can free, a free shower or something like that. I love seeing the towns on the PCT, because they're not the typical towns that a tourist would go to or where you would go to. Normally, if you just went out to California, you might think LA and Venice Beach and all that. But you get to see all these small towns and see how people are living. There's a lot of country out there so you get to see all these different places that are off the beaten path. It's just a good experience to get out and see things and do things and, of course, meet new people. That's what I like is to meet the new people and to hang out with-- Hiker trash. Yeah. You know you're a total stranger one minute, and the next, here we are together-- One day is like a week. --eating cookies, you know, and talking together. I'm better known on the trail as St. Alfonzo with a z. And that's how most people are known. Most people usually don't tell their true identities on the trail. In fact, I don't even know the true identities of the hiker's I'm with, I just know them by their trail names. When the trail name is bestowed upon you by others as a definition of your true self. Kind of interesting thing about trail names is if you acquire one that you don't like, you have to lose it very quickly, because they do tend to stick to you like a bad persona. On the trail, I'm named as the Norther Strider. My name is Das Boot. Bamboo Bob. I go by Deep. Good Spot. Scuba. My trail name is Beam. The Old Ridge Rider. Love Shots. The Hemlock Muppet. I'm Petal with a T like the flower. Trail name is Stumbling Norwegian. Birdie. Scratcher. Wanka. Before I had all this, people thought I looked like Phil Collins and they wanted to call me Phil Collins. And I wouldn't let them. My trail name is OSG, which is short for the orange-shirted guy. So it became Not Phil Collins. They call me Homeless. Wheeler. Strider. Which became short for Not Phil. Einstein. Fix It. River. Which became Not Nofo. The Governor of Dangerous Snake. And then when this started getting really long, they called me The Walrus. We were all taking shots and I knocked over the bottle. And everybody screamed party foul. The name stuck, but the bottle was empty. And I didn't commit any party foul, but that's my name. Your name's Party Foul. You've made many since then. That's true. We went down into a town Wrightwood and that was the first opportunity I had to go to a grocery store. And I just picked up a jar of pickles. And they saw me sitting outside the grocery store with my jar of pickles just eating straight out of it. And they're like you're definitely Pickle Monster now. So I took it. Why don't we do it this year? We could be dead next year. You know let's do it this year. Why wait till next year. So I'm Why Wait. And she's just like why not? Her name's Why Not. She said Why Not? Let's do it. So we're by an outfitter. And there's a whole bunch of us PCT hikers hanging out. And I really wanted some ice cream. So I went next door to a grocery market. And they had these Dryer's fruit bar. So I bought it. And the first thing he said when he bites into one of them is like creamsicle. I'm going to call you Creamsicle. Everyone starts laughing and calling me Creamsicle. And I didn't like it at first, you know, well, I mean, there's the manly names like Foxtrot or Rocket Man. And then you've got Creamsicle and I'm like ah. My trail name, it's Vegimite. And it's Vegimite because I am Australian and Vegemite is the most famous Australian spread to put on toast, but also because for this entire trip, which is, you know, is close to 600 miles hike, I've been carrying Vegemite with me, so they call me Vegimite. On the trail, you'll meet a lot of people. But you're all stripped down to your essence. You're all just people. You aren't defined by your occupation, which as often what happens and how you self-define yourself when you meet in the outside world. We're all equal. There's no caste system. And it's really just ourselves as individuals and personalities that come together. It's really rewarding. You know, I can go hiking anywhere. But there is this amazing culture on the trail, on the PCT. They you don't really find anywhere else. You have all kinds of different people-- high tech guys like me hanging out with people from all other kinds of walks of life and folks that I would probably never associate with, unfortunately, in real life. But out here on the trail, it's like we're instant friends as soon as we meet. Somebody called the trail the great equalizer. People from every forum of life coming together who all have all this in common all of a sudden. Their experiences on the trail, we all have the same experiences. The things we go through, it's all the same. So when you sit down with somebody who might be either millionaires or somebody who hasn't even had $100 in their pocket before, everybody has so much in common we're all friends on the trail. We all look out for each other. It's been a terrific experience to see that. OK, cool. All right. All right. See you guys later. Yep. It takes away people's preconceived notions and people don't judge people by a book by the cover and stuff like that. So, it's an experience that a lot of people, sadly, won't have in their lives. And living in regular society, it's kind of almost impossible for that to happen anyway. So, that's one of the really fortunate things about hiking a long distance trail, you really can look at people a little differently. [CHATTER] The hiking community is a very strong, tight family. You're never going to meet so many people who have a general care and a general common thread between each other so fast with hardly even knowing each other than the hiking community. The through hikers have retained that kind of community and that kind of responsibility for each other in a way that, I think, I haven't really experienced before. A lot of the fun of PCT is meeting people. And when we have zero days in town, you get to hang out and go to restaurants with people. It's a very interesting group. I think all the people in the hiking community tend to be more open to ideas. They tend to be open people. They're out exploring their world. And these are people that are willing to tough it out. They come from all different walks of life. There are two distinct age groups that tend to do through hiking. You've got the young guys who are in college or just out of college who haven't really settled on a career yet. And then you've got the retirees who have gone all the way through a career and family and everything and now they're free again and they can do that. Landscapes are inspiring. But you know the people you're meet out here are also inspiring, too. There's lot of negativity out there in the world today or at least the media sometimes makes the world out to be negative. And I think that out here on the trail, you really see that people are pretty kind, I think, all in all. The hikers are just an amazing group of people. And the way that the hiking community watches out for each other, I think is the way that God intended humanity to work. [MUSIC PLAYING] People know what we're doing, it's now a known thing. And towns and people on the trail they know who you are, what you're doing. And in particular, the trail angel's has just been amazing. Yeah. I can't say enough about the Trail Angels. And I mean it's not only the ones we've met and stayed with, like Saufleys and people like that. But it's the ones that did the food caches and the water caches, especially in the desert. I mean it's just-- that floored me. I wasn't expecting anything like that to the extent that we saw it. The Trail Angels are just incredible. And they're incredible on this trail. I can't even begin to thank them enough, just the recharge, the mental recharge, and physical recharge you get there is just amazing. You look forward to the next one. You know you'll pull up to a trail head. And somebody will be making you a root beer float or people taking you to their home, feed you. Pancake Master. Griddle Supreme. Trail angels that give us water or give us food or a cooler on the side of the road or something or invite you into their house. You know we're complete strangers. We've stayed with a lot of the trail angels and I mean that's some of our best stories of the trip, with the oil wrestling at the Anderson's and all sorts of crazy stuff like that. I mean that without them, they supply us water when there's water shortages and stuff like that. So without them, I don't even know if we could make some of the sections. Or at least they would be miserable if we did. When we moved here, I realized we're living by the trail and how cool that is. And we would see hikers from time to time. So then on this Monday, years ago-- it is actually what '99? It had to be '99-- I decided to make vegetable soup. For no apparent reason. Yeah. For no reason at all. I just woke up on a Monday morning, thought I'd make vegetable soup. Didn't have to go to work, obviously. So finally, in the early evening, it's ready. It's done. So she says, hey, there's some hikers outside. So we walked down to the corner and we meet two hikers. And she says, this morning my husband woke up craving vegetable soup. And so we hoped that we could find some here at the restaurant, but it's closed. Because it's a Monday. So he was sort of upset, because he couldn't get his vegetable soup. We were shocked. At this point, we're looking at each other and we're like no way. You aren't going to believe this-- After the whole day of ordeal of fighting over this soup, now here it is. This is reason why the reason we-- I made it. And so they joined us for dinner. And we talked to them and had a lovely evening. And they were fascinating. That's how we got started, vegetable soup, pretty soup. Vegetable soup and the internet. And the internet, yeah. When you ask people, could you do the PCT? And people say, oh, I could never do it. And I think one, it's physical. But the other is being alone with yourself that much. It's kind of the unasked question is what are people thinking about? And then when you ask hikers about it, they come of these really amazing things that they do. So some people are totally focused on the maps and the altimeter. And they're watching everything really carefully. And then you have me, where I kind of go off on kind of these mind treks. I still have a lot of thinking to do about where I want to go. And I think that's possibly what everybody is kind of doing is how they prioritize things in life. And that's where this is is prioritizing. Your brain just wanders. It does not shut off. It thinks of all kinds stuff. Food, family, friends. Jobs, what you did before, what you're going to do next. Like you're going to eat as soon as get to town. Sometimes I get a stupid song stuck in my head for hours. I think about life, the universe, and everything. Sometimes I try not to think about anything. Also kind of thinking about what I want to do when I get back, not only work wise, but just what I want to do with the next part of my life, basically. I purposely try not to think about work or family or anything outside of the trail until the last day. And then I allow myself to do some reflection. Not everybody who's in society has a lot of time to think about their demons. But I really know mine now. When you get like a negative thought in your mind or an idea, you don't even really realize what trips it or triggers it. And then they don't get a chance to work it all through and talk it through with yourself in your mind and then come to like some conclusions. Like modern society, if you're working and doing all your stuff outside of work and just taking care of your responsibilities, a lot of people don't even have the time to like go through that process. I sing to myself all the time. I mean I'm just like oh, that's pretty, oh. I often think about past girlfriends. And obviously, I think about my current girlfriend as well. Gives me some little nice memories to not feel alone. I'm thinking of things that I haven't thought of in years. A lot of old memories have resurfaced that normally you wouldn't think about. I guess that's been the biggest thing. These memories that they become very, very vivid and very real and you can feel them again. And they're things that you haven't touched for awhile. When I did the AT, it was in honor of a friend who got murdered. We were all Eagle Scouts together. So me and another friend hiked in honor of him. And so I'm carrying his ashes again this time. Stephen Harrington passed away November 2005. And so his families are huge supporters of just doing things that he probably would be doing with me if he weren't gone. I'm a land surveyor. That's what I did for about 2 and 1/2 years. And then I got laid off due to the great economy that we have right now. So I thought it would be a good time to plan and hike. I am a scuba instructor. I am seeking employment. I am a software developer for Microsoft, so I sit behind a desk all day. Professionally, I do humanitarian work, which means I respond to both wars and natural disasters. But I've moved from direct response to doing policy, international policy. I am a carpenter. I'm a commercial fisherman. I'm a civil trial attorney with about 25 years of experience. I do business law. I am a financial analyst. I am a wildlife biologist. Soon to change hopefully, unemployed, professional in the agricultural industry. I teach music three days a week at inner city school in Oakland. And I've been doing that for two years. I'm going to go back in October. And then I pick up shifts at a restaurant. I am an unemployed person that quit my job. I sold my practice. I'm an interior designer and Finn's an architect. I'm an architect. And we bot quit our jobs. You know when push comes to shove, we're not defined by our jobs. We're defined by what we give back. And it's our children, you know, there are echoes of ourselves down through succeeding generations. And there is also our own self-fulfillment. And I think that you find that the most on the trail. I made a list of everyone's professions that I could find. As I meet people, I add to the list and I'm going to add to it as far as what people are transitioning to. And I think that's when people kind of know, they know kind of where they're going and they're kind of searching and things kind of settling out. So you know people who are joining the military like Left Field or Sangria, who just dropped off to go to medical school. Future's become more solid. And people can see that. They can see a rough definition of what the future looks like, but then through the trail it becomes clear and more focused. For a lot of people, a lot of people are in life transition moments. And they spend a lot of time thinking about that. To do this trip, I actually had to quit my job. So I don't know for sure what I'm going to do for work when I get back or whether or not I'll try to get back to where I worked before or whether I'll just try to be an independent contractor or what. So it's kind of the work aspect of it, but that's not going to happen for another month or two anyways. So I'm not too concerned about right now. That slot for international playboy still open? That's right. I can look into that, too, then. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] The desert of the first 700 miles of this trail were like the kiddie trail or something. I like that it's flat. It was smooth. And you had to carry a lot of water or food sometimes. But, yeah, the Stairs have been nothing like anything we've seen before like the rivers you have to ford, the mountains you have to go over, the snow. We've had like terrible weather, thunderstorms, and hailstorms, and snowstorms. And you know, we had none of that, we had like great, perfect weather almost through the desert. The desert to me felt like hazing in a fraternity or a sorority, just kind of beat you up and long, waterless stretches and hot. Your pack's heavy. And finally, when you get through the desert, you feel like you're in shape. Then you get to the Sierras and it's just hard all over again for different reasons. Nothing can prepare you for doing the ups and downs in the Sierras. I think that being in the desert helped in terms of conditioning. It helped to say, oh, I hiked 700 miles before I had to do all the ups and downs in the Sierras. But there's nothing that can prepare you to do what you do out here. That's just something that you've got to embrace and run with every time it comes to you. [MUSIC PLAYING] I think people see a truth and a simplicity of living. Your choices are what you're going to eat, when you're going to stop, where your next camp is. It's different when you're in everyday life and it's busy and you're just thinking about the next moment. I guess hiking helps you connect with the present. When you sit down to relax, you just relax. You're not thinking about work. You're not thinking about your chores. You're not thinking about errands. It's just you sit there and take in what you're taking in at the moment. And that's been amazing. That's kind of what I looked forward to is five months of not being on a computer or talking on a cell phone, just getting away from all that. You know hiking the trail really is a throwback to what we basically evolved to do. Because, you know, basically we were nomadic before we settled down and developed agriculture and everything. And it really takes you back. And it's really the true essence of self. [MUSIC PLAYING] [RIVER RUSHING] I want this to be my way of life. I want my life to be as close to this as possible always. We're legitimate homeless people. It's pretty sweet, carrying like all you own on your back. I can carry basically almost everything I need for a week or so on my back. And it's just really wonderful just waking up in the woods and going to sleep out here every night, just seeing the changes, I guess, along the way. Just the peacefulness and quietness of being out in the woods. Well you spend so much of the rest of your time in life dealing with little stuff that really probably doesn't matter in the big picture. That's for me, like that's the biggest appeal of the trail is that like it just boils everything down to the simplest elements. And that's why I love it out here. [MUSIC PLAYING] I think you quickly learn on the trail no one really hikes alone, because I've met so many people on the trail. And you wind up hiking for three or four days with somebody and it's like you from this bond that just doesn't break. You see them a month later and it's like a long lost friend. You can make it a social experience. I mean there are many groups that travel together. And then again, there are just as many people that are going solo, probably. So it's whatever you want to make of it. It is a solo experience, because ultimately you're walking it by yourself. You're carrying the weight. You're putting the foot steps down. It is a social thing, because inevitably you hook up with people that move about your pace that have same or similar interests. And also you hook up with people who have a similar sense of humor. So it's a little bit of both. This is Stink and she is my trail companion. When I first started talking about doing the trail, I was going to do it alone, which made a lot of people, including myself, nervous. So I decided to acquire a little hiking companion. So I got her for the trail and we've been trail training since I brought her home about two years ago. I picked the breed that I knew could handle the trail. And I trained with her very seriously in the years leading up to the trail. We trained with the packs ever since she was old enough to carry them, which is about nine or 10 months. I have sorts of special staffs, goops, and sprays for her paws. I haven't really had any problems with her. She had one tiny blister in the desert and that was it. Since then she's just stellar. We hike alone and then we just end up taking breaks together or camping together. But it wasn't even that you're hiking with friends, it's just kind of like I lost my friends. And then it's, ah, when you separate from groups, you might not see them for like two weeks or maybe even a month. So that's the lost feeling. But then, you know, you get back into town. You meet other people, people who you catch up with, people catching up with you. like in this town. So I feel like re-energized. So many people that do this, I think, start just by themselves. I think very few where you've got a couple of people who are doing it as friends, because a lot of times it's hard to get somebody to commit to do something like this if you're going to do it. So a lot of people like that social interaction with people. And they just figure I'll hook up with somebody on the trail. I think it is much easier as a couple to have someone to continuously share it with and just even going back home we both understand the true meaning and value of what it was to us and have that to confide and reflect in. We can split the weight of the gear. So if we had to make a decision about which way to go at a trail junction and there wasn't a sign, there were two of us thinking about it. But beyond all that just the practicality stuff, like for mental aspect, of having somebody there with you. I couldn't imagine being alone out here, because you get worn out. And especially although you had a boyfriend or wife or girlfriend at home like-- It would be easy to get lonely on the trail, I think. So it was very helpful to have somebody here. But I don't know. It's easier when you hike with someone, because I would never quit because I knew he-- you know, I wouldn't want to leave him out there. Not like he couldn't handle it without me, or-- we are in it together. [RIVER RUSHING] One thing my friend Stephen always wanted to do was hike Whitney. One thing I did was I did turn the trail into my midlife crisis. And I think that's kind of a wise decision because it made me get out, puts me on the controlled starvation diet, makes me get exercise, makes me get spiritually in tune with things, and makes me get out and get lost, miserable, cold, starving, bug bitten, sunburn, dehydrated, and altitude sick all at once. Yeah, you just keep going. That's all. Just one foot in front of the other. And I keep on telling myself all I'm doing is walking. How hard could it be? You know? I mean people have done this for years. So I should be able to do it, too. So just keep walking. I'm doing something that the other people only dream of. The number of times I've run into people who are like you are doing what I've always wanted to do. And I think about that. It's like there's a lot of people out there that would kill to be able to do what I'm doing and they can't for whatever reason. There's always that voice inside that says quit, sit down, cry, go home. There's also the other voice that says, no, you can do it. You've been through worse. It's not as bad as you think, just get through today. Something another hiker told me years ago was don't quit the trail on a bad day, because you'll never come back to it. Everybody quits when it's a bad day when they're at their wit's end. And I've kind of kept that in mind. I try to make every day a good day. I don't get to control the weather. I don't get to control the trail conditions. I don't get to control what comes my way. But I have to learn to deal it within myself. And that's the important-- that's one of the lessons you learn on the trail is that the external stuff is always going to be there thrown at you. But where the real transformation or where the real magic happens is when it takes place within side of you and you can look at it and say it's not that bad. If you set the small goals, then the big goals kind of take care of themselves. We just found out the last-- or a couple of weeks ago-- that our house got broken into. Awesome. So it's weird being on the trail away from everything at home and then having to deal with like a break in in the house and someone renting it out. Luckily, her parents are there. So there's somebody there. But it kind of makes it like being out here you're like what do you do? You know you can't cry about it. You can't do anything about it. You can't take care of it. Think of how many good times are to come on a the trail. Like if you get off, you're going to skip out on this little hardship but there is so much better stuff coming. So I don't know. It just never really crossed my mind to get off. I think the thing that makes everything better for everyone is that everybody that you're on trail with is going through the same thing. Yeah. So it kind of really soothes the pain in a way. Everybody who starts this thinks they can do it. It's a huge endeavor mentally and physically. And I think because I've done this trail before, I recognized that it is luck that you're able to complete it. And that every moment on the trail is you're lucky. And that optimism and just feeling really positive that it is-- you know, even if your past was hellish, I'm still on the trail. [MUSIC PLAYING] I guess more than anything, what kept me going was just the stubbornness, for one, but the want to actually complete a whole hike from border to border, and really be able to feel proud about that. I had accepted that the trail was infinite, forever. But I figured that was the only way I could really get a grasp on how long I was going to be on the trail. And so about northern California, I just got bored. And I thought that it would be like that forever, because it was infinite. And then I got an mp3 player for when I wasn't hiking with these guys. And I couldn't believe how fast the music could turn things around. Happy music really made me happy all of a sudden. It was so cool. But, yeah, if I wasn't with these guys who are probably the best part of it, it was something small like that. And even different is goo. If I just up and quit, I wouldn't be able to live with myself, because I know I'll never do something like this again, not to this extent anyway. So that's another driving force. This is my one and only shot, I think. You just kind of have to take it break by break and town by town. When it's such a huge trip like this, you just break it down to manageable pieces in your mind anyway. Stay focused on the big picture. There are so many little details that you can get caught up on a hike like this. And at the end of the day, you just remember that you're hiking 20 to 25 miles a day and you just happened to be carrying a place to sleep and some food with you and some water. And so just don't look at it as one big hike, look at it as a bunch of little hikes strung together. And that helps make it a little bit more manageable. What kept me going was just having friends to support me. And it was something I wanted to do. I did a lot of research before I got on the trail, so I knew the mind games and I knew the physical challenges that were going to come. And so I was a little more prepared for them, or at least I knew they were going to happen. So when they did happen, it wasn't a big surprise and I knew they were going to end. And I knew one day, I would reach the border and this would all be over, and I'd miss it once it was over. So I enjoyed it while it lasted. At moments, like early in the morning or late in the afternoon, I'm finding that I just I like the walking. You know, the scenery is good and it's good to be out alone and can be out in the wilderness and everything. But the walk feels good. It feels like it feels good to get on the trail, put your pack on, and just walk. It's a rhythm that's enjoyable. So that makes it easier to just keep going. Most important ingredients are just the mental flexibility. The people who are just brittle and uptight, you just look at them and go, wow, it's not going to work too well. It was really neat to see what one person can do when they focus solely on one project and they just kind of, each day, plug away at that one project. And seeing how much you can do with that, it's pretty cool. No matter, no matter what kind of circumstances you come through, usually you just have to dig deep and find the motivation to keep going. Keep those feet moving. [MUSIC PLAYING] The constant pounding on my feet has been a difficult, difficult challenge to overcome. And I still haven't even really overcome it. It's just like a new blister here, just new soreness there. And I've had some other physical problems with like my back, you know, just carrying the pack all the time. But nothing that has stopped me from walking, which I'm so, so thankful for. Because there are people that have had to take time off to heal or get over something. And I've been fortunate enough to be in a condition where I was able to push through the minor pains that I've had. So I have been very fortunate. I was coming down Mount San Jacinto and developed some pain. And it turned out I tore the ligament off my tibia. And I got across over to Mission Creek. And I taped up my leg and climbed 5,000 feet up to where it met the Trail Angel that day. But once I got to the top, it turned out that the athletic tape had resulted in heavy second degree chemical burns, so I got some scars out of it. And I'm basically off the trail until next year. But I'll be back out there, along with a couple of my friends that I've met on the trail this year. And Dave's going to provide support and it's all good. I've had my fair share of blisters and stuff, but fought them, you know, like everybody else does. I have had a couple of bouts with heat exhaustion where I had actually back check out about 20 miles one time and get to a road and get to a doctor, make sure everything was OK. The heat exhaustion was probably the scariest part, just because I'd never really experienced that before. And I was actually by myself at the time. Getting the right shoes takes time and money. And it's not the best process of elimination. I ended up having to spend a week off trail for just insane blisters. I had like 16 blisters or something. But they were just like huge. And I had to get different shoes. And, yeah, that was the worst for me. Like I don't know how many miles I did with just in excruciating pain. I can't believe I'm wearing a 7.5. I kind of cried like. You don't understand. I always had the prettiest feet. Like that was like the thing that people would say what do you like the best. And I'm like my feet are so pretty, my pedicure and my nails were so perfect. Now, I've got the ugliest feet in the world. They've grown a whole size. Yeah, but you're hiking across the United States. Yeah. No, I don't care. The toll on your body basically 24 hours a day, my feet-- I have never thought about my feet more in my entire life. And I can't wait to get home and stop thinking about them. My worst day on the trail was definitely the first day. I probably showed up at the border with probably like 60 pounds with like after food and water. And I just had too much gear. And it was a long haul to get to Lake Marine. It was a hard day. I like broke down pretty much when we got there. And it was like 9:30 at night. I'd never been in the desert before. It was dark. Who knows what the hell is out there. I was freaking out. But I got there, but I almost quit after that. We've had some bad weather in the Sierras. We got snowed on about two inches, and we had a super ultralight-- not super ultralight, but it's not a four season tent by any means. So it was kind of a shock to wake up with that much snow and all of our stuff got wet. And we had to decide whether to go back into Lone Pine or continue to Independence. And one, going back was 26 miles and going forward was 30 miles. And we had two days of food. We couldn't wait out the weather. So we decided to go forward, which meant we had to go over Forester Pass. About five minutes after we made it to the top, low lying clouds came in. And it was almost white-out conditions. You could only see 20 feet in front of you. So we had to bust down Forester. We didn't know how much snow there was, because we couldn't see the trail. So we just followed somebody's footprints and we went the right way. And we made it. That was our first through. So it was really scary, sketchy, and very exhilarating. So it's fun that we lived through it, but there were times it was pretty scary. [THUNDER BOOM] On the second to the fourth day in Washington when it continually rained. We were just soaked to the bone and putting on socks every day, every morning, saturated clothes. Because you want to sleep in your dry gear. And nothing dried out. So that wasn't much fun. That led to a lot of old injuries started to flare up, because of being cold and wet. We both got lots of chafing in unimaginable places. Places you don't want chafing. Yep. So it wasn't so much the toughest day. I'd say personally for me, those were the three most miserable days. Because even when you got a really hard time, or a really hard descent, as soon as it's over, you can look back on it and relive the arduous moments and joke about it. But three days of sopping wet coldness, it really wasn't much fun. There's probably as many reasons as there are people of doing it. I think that some people are running away from their basic daily life. Other people will use that period of time to reflect on their life. And others will do it like for the physical challenge, for becoming in with nature. My church has leaves. I think the most beneficial thing is to immerse yourself in God's creation and be separated from man created things. And I think even whatever level of spirituality you want to believe in, but just connecting with nature in itself has been the most powerful thing of the trail. I think that being out in the wilderness and in God's creation you can't help but notice the beauty and think about where it's come from and how it got to be that way. So there have been some instances where I'm up on the mountaintop and I'm looking over the creation and just amazed at what God's made. For me, though, the biggest reminders of Christ and of his creation has been my interactions with people out here. It starts off physical, which of course it is. You know, that's all you think about like I have this knot in my back. And then it turns to mental. And your body is fine, but you're like, oh, do I really want to be doing this? And then it turns into like the other realm of spiritual or whatever where you just walk, because that's what you do. And I kind of feel that really strongly. It's so much more than you can even explain when you're out here. Because you're looking for 10 plus hours a day sometimes, and you're by yourself most of the time. It's just you and what's in between your ears. So it's getting a chance to learn a lot about yourself. And like the Lord for me is what he's revealed to me, so that's kind of something I was definitely looking forward to was more and more time with me and God. And this has been one unbelievable experience for that. And it's just I know I'll never get another opportunity to just like five months where you're just walking by yourself for 10 hours a day. But I never really came out here trying to learn something about myself, it's just kind of been a nice bonus. [WATER GUSHING] The more time I spend on the trail, the less ego I have. Yes, there's the ego that wants to finish. Yes, there's the ego that wants to hike the miles. Yes, there is the ego that wants to eat and sleep at the end of the day. But what if the trail isn't about you at all? What if you're just one small cell in the body of the Pacific Crest Trail? It's really not about you at all. It's sometimes about losing the ego, losing the me, me, me of the trail. There are moments on the trail where one just kind of gets into the zone and everything else just kind of melts away. All the cares, all the worries, about the next water source, all the worries about the next campsite, there are moments when sometimes when you're on the high ridge just traversing along the mountainside when you're just in the zone and every thing is flowing. At one point, it's like it becomes like another day at the office. So you're wondering why you're doing it. I would never quit. But I was definitely-- Questioning why you were doing it? Yeah. Like what are we doing ourselves? The doldrums of the day in, day out, trying to find the inspiration and the motivation to get up every day to do the same thing, even though it hurts like crazy with every step that you take. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Made it! Oregon. California just drags on forever. And I was really anxious to get in Oregon and to just be able to say, yes, I went through California. I am in the next state. Pooba! Welcome to Oregon. Welcome, big guy! Euphoric is a word I think I used to describe it. I was so excited. I mean it was just the fact that I was in another state. Interstate high five. It was rewarding, invigorating, the sense of accomplishment was unreal knowing that 106 days of trudging from the time that I left the Mexican border to then, I mean it was just like day in and day out, it is all consuming getting to the next place. And then finally, you just kind of start-- you don't even feel like you're close to Oregon. I mean for all you know, you could just be walking in different circles every day and you just don't know it. And then all of a sudden, you see that Oregon sign. You're like holy crap, you know, I made it. I really am moving north, even though the trail doesn't seem to be going north. So that was kind of-- that was how I felt when I got to Oregon. Pretty [MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah, I definitely like to treat. And if it's coming from bubbling out from a spring or something like that, I'll drink that. But if it's river or a stream, or I like to like to treat it. I'm definitely concerned. Yeah. These filters are good for the giardia and the crypto which are the two most prevalent things you'd probably get out somewhere in this sort of an area. The bacteria and virus, this really won't do anything for. That's when the Aquamira drops are a lot better, because it'll take care of most of that stuff, too. Actually we've got quite a few people who aren't treating at all. I'm surprised. Quite a few people that we've seen that have been ill. All right. We have water. Time to dine. Water's good. [MUSIC PLAYING] If I was feeling down a little bit, I'd just stop and have a little snack-- Snacks. Chocolate. Granola bar, Snickers bar. Then I'd be good. It is for a hike. That is funny. He's right. Because if you're feeling bad and you're just pushing yourself, you're hiking for a really long time, you're getting sore, just stop and like eat, you get so happy. It's weird. I don't even know how many conversations we've had like once we've got in to camp and we're eating something and be like, man, I wish I had some ice cream right now or just whatever, you know. It's A lot of times, it's about food. That's the worst. You get cravings. You're on the trail and you can do nothing about it. And you're just thinking about these elaborate, luxurious meals. It's terrible. The previous 40 couple of weeks where we were rationing food and had long stretches and less food to eat, yeah, I thought a lot about donuts and pancakes. And then after a while, fish, started to think about the things my body was telling me it wanted. I wish I had more salad and broccoli, greens. Donuts and chips and candy and a burger, pizza. Soda. Generally, I don't eat junk food. But you get out here and you hike so much, you get really hungry. And to get the calories that we need to get, you have to eat a lot of crappy food. I dehydrate most of my meals at home and then I ship them to me. So I've got really, really good food on the trail. Although I'm getting kind of tired of it. I hope my home dried lasagna seemed fantastic the first few times, but now I'm looking forward to just getting a burger at Burney Falls. The towns definitely make the food seem a lot better. It gives you something to look forward to and something to hike forever every now and again. A little bit of salami, a little bit of cheese, just like eating at a fine restaurant. [MUSIC PLAYING] Bridge of the Gods, baby. Having Here we go. We're walking right on over the Columbia River into Washington. Last state. We're feeling pretty happy. [MUSIC PLAYING] The piece that I didn't know was going to happen was all gone weight we were going to lose. I mean, I knew we'd lose weight, because we've always done that on bike trips and stuff like that. But just the amount that we lost kind of surprised me. And as fast as I got down there, too, because when we got to the Saufleys', I mean I had already lost, basically, 30 pounds almost by that time. And, yeah, we hadn't even been out that long really. I've definitely lost over 35 pounds, because it came off quite quickly at one stage. There were a few sections where we had like six, seven days out. And so you're rationing food in reasonably tough terrain. So that's when I was definitely-- my body was consuming itself. And I had a quite a rapid weight loss in one section. I have had twice in the last week that my pants have fallen off of me as I'm hiking because I've lost so much weight. Oh, I've lost 20, 30 pounds. 20, 25 pounds. Yeah, probably about 25 pounds. I lost 23 pounds. Yeah, I had lost right around 30, 35 pounds. I lost 20 something pounds. It's like an extra backpack I don't have to carry around with me. So it's been a lot nicer. Yeah. It's really only your legs that change. Your upper body kind of shrivels a little bit. I try and eat as much as I can on the trail. I was snacking just a minute ago and eat like crazy in town, too. So, yeah, I don't think I've lost too much, which is a good thing, because I lost a bunch of weight on the Appalachian Trail. And I don't want to repeat that again. That's one of the side benefits of being a through hiker is being able to eat as much as you want of anything whenever you want and not gain any weight. It's pretty great. Definitely gotten in really good shape, you know. Hiked 31.4 miles yesterday, so that was pretty cool to be able to do something like that. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, after nearly 4 and 1/2 months, over 2,600 miles, and both being in excess of 35 pounds lighter, we've finally made it. Ta-da. Nearly slipping over. Here we are. We've made it all the way to the northern terminus and about to enter Canada. To all of us. To all of us. Yeah. 35 miles left to go on the trail. I'm going to finish. You know there's no crying in baseball, right? There's no whining in football. And there's no tripping at the finish line on the PCT. Not everybody crosses the finish line. I haven't yet. I still have 35 miles to go. It's always a big question mark in the back of your head. Are you going to be able to finish? I think at this point, yeah, I'm going to finish. I think it was partly like, wow, it's like it actually is there. It's not just like this idea, this goal in your head that you go after every day, day after day, from literally until the time you wake up until the time you go to sleep and then every stop in between. It's a singular focus on maintaining forward momentum and trying to get as many miles in as you possibly can before the sun goes down the next day. So seeing that actually become reality and seeing that there is a monument there, it was-- I'll admit it, it was a little emotional. I was by myself and emotionally, it was kind of overwhelming. Still is. So. But it was just kind of, you know, relief and pride. I think it's proved to ourselves what we can do, what we're capable of again. And it's affected me in a way that it just makes me want to push myself further on something else. I think it's probably the single greatest accomplishment I did, just as far as the physical aspect of it being so hard. It's like one more chapter, you know, one more thing I got done that I wanted to get done. I'm very proud that we did it. Just kind of looking forward to the next thing we're going to do. I don't know if it's even sunk in yet, really. Yeah, it was kind of a relief to be done, but then weird at the same time. I just never really believed it was going to be over. You know, anything can happen at any time and you just never know if you're really going to finish or not. I don't know. Yeah. You never could really feel like you were for sure going to make it to the end, because the weather was questionable. You could always injure yourself right before the end, so it was hard to really get excited until you are finally done. And then it happened so quickly that you didn't really have time to think about it. Yeah. Changed my view on people. Nothing that I didn't know before, but it reminded me how positivity can spread. Just it's amazing the experience, just the kindness of others towards us and the hiker community. And it just kind of like renews your faith in being friendly to other people and smiling and making eye contact. I was pretty stoked. I was still in disbelief though. Who just like is this it? Is this-- am I done? Is this the last thing? I don't know what to feel. No one's here to tell me what's to feel. I'm like, ah, I feel pretty happy. And I didn't even know that Monuments 78 opened until he showed up and he opened it, and I was like, oh, it pops open. And, then, yeah, it was pretty cool. And I didn't even notice the border. I guess they leveled all those trees to make the Canadian--United States border. I just saw the monument, I was like, oh, that's it. I realized how big of a role family plays in my life. And then my friends back at home, like I made some great friends out here, but I realized I just want to be home with my family kind of thing. I'm a family guy, I realized for sure. I didn't notice that before. I mean before this, when you're growing up as a kid, everybody tells you, you can do anything you want, you can be anything you want to be. And, you know, I always thought that to some degree, but I never really believed it until now, really, until I did this hike and decided I'm going to walk from Mexico to Canada and did it. And now I really do believe I can do anything. It's hard being away from home for a long time. Being away my family and my girlfriend was hard. It gives you a good perspective on the things you like at home and what you appreciate and also for the things you like out here and the things you'll miss out here. I can't-- I can't imagine having spent the last six months doing anything else. I've grown a lot and just extended. And I'm more confident, more secure. Just I got rid of a lot of fears. And even the people that are around the trail, the Trail Angels and the Trail Magic, I mean, it's just been such a positive reflection of humanity. I mean, it's just a glimpse of the good side in people, you know? It's been really nice. Before this, I kind of took things for granted. Just having like running water and just everything else, like a roof over your head, I just appreciate it so much more. I don't know, everything like above like food, water, and shelter is like an extra blessing, you know. [MUSIC PLAYING] Losing a friend is hard. But gaining two more really good ones is better. This trip really has been more about the journey, not so much getting to the end. I just wanted to come out here and experience whatever I was going to experience and to spread the rest to my friend Steve's ashes. I was fortunate and lucky enough to carry his ashes not only on the Appalachian Trail two years ago, but also on my trip out here. I think I did what I needed to get done. I've made some great friends along the way. And I've enjoyed being out here. And I guess it's time to head back to the real world. It's all good. It's all good. What do you do after? Well, you re-enter. You re-enter the other reality of your workaday world with your home and family. And this is only one reality, the trail. It's a reality a lot of us choose for different reasons. It's something that a lot of us choose because we don't know the reason, sometimes, too. I'll go back. I'll go back to work, but I won't be the same person, hopefully not. I wouldn't want to be the same person. I wouldn't want to bring back the smaller self. The trick is to keep the higher summits in mind, to keep the higher learning that you learn on the trail, and the higher things you learn about yourself, really. The trail is really an amazing crucible for learning about oneself. Suddenly, I find when you get back to your own reality, back home to people that have been following the journey or people you haven't seen in a while, perhaps a little bit bigheadedly, but that's when bragging rights really start to come out. And you then you can really start to relive your accomplishment and realize what you've achieved once you're back in your own sort of habitat. Start the re-entry process, I guess. I need to get my mind out of hiking and back into family mode. Take a little time to readjust, I think for sure. I think choices are going to be hard. Yeah, that's probably true. Because we haven't had to make any decisions really on the trail. It's like you have to do a certain number of things like eat and walk and sleep. Now, it's going to be like sensory overload a little bit. We make a choice in each moment how we're going to engage that moment. Are we going to engage each moment we come across with-- are we going to engage it with fear and scarcity? Or are we going to engage it, on the other hand, with loving kindness and generosity? And that's a choice each of us make at every moment. Most of us make it unconsciously without knowing that we're making that choice. Most of us, unfortunately, in our workaday world, live in a world of fear and scarcity. I find myself falling into that when I'm off the trail. On the trail, I find myself falling into the other hand, not the fear and scarcity, but the generosity and loving kindness-- generosity with one's time, generosity with one's food, with whatever one has to help other hikers on the trail. And that's, really, I think the true gift of the trail. That's what you bring back with you. You bring back the generosity and the loving kindness of the trail and the loving kindness of complete strangers who you'll run into on the trail, who will help you. You bring that back to your workaday world. And you bring those gifts of the trail back. And you bring those to your life in the city or your life in a suburb. And that is, really, I think the greatest lesson the trail has to offer. It's what you bring back from the trail. Don't leave the best part of yourself back on the trail. Let the trail improve you and then bring that back to the people you love and everyone you come in contact with. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPED UP CHATTER]
