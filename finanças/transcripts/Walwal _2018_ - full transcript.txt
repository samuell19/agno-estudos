[Bobby] Dondi Dela Cruz, the group's former loverboy. He was a certified fuckboy. But now, a lover boy. Not because he found God. But because he found Carla. Ever since he got obsessed with Carla, he turned into a really cheesy guy. He said he was now reformed. He can now go to heaven or the supreme court. -You're lucky someone pays your education. -[Bobby] Attorney Dela Cruz in the making. That's what his dad wants for him. But they let your younger brother, Uncle Bobet, to finish Medicine first. And he's finally a dermatologist. -Ana, that's not the point. -Wait, Dad. I'm not yet finished. But then you'll say, "It's okay because Dondi will fulfill your dreams." Right? [Bobby] Idol! -Say hello to your fans, bro! -Hey, Bobby! Bob! [Bobby] Marco Castillo, the master playboy. He's a chick magnet. A ruthless one at that! I forgot your name. -Can you refresh my memory? -Come on! We've dated three times. Until now you don't know my name? I'm sorry because, you know, that's your beauty's effect on me. I forget everything whenever I see you. [Bobby] It's 2018. But with Marco, his pickup lines are still from the year 2008. -So what are you doing later? -Hey, but it still works. You want to get out of here? -Hey, Marco! -Paps! Paps, give me a nice room, okay? A good one. -You're set for room 306. -But, Paps, I always get the room 307. -The restroom in 306 is bad, man. -It's occupied. Someone got it first. Next time, come early. -Paps, make it right next time. -Sure. Will you look at her? She's so beautiful. He'll make up for it next time. You know what? You smell like cinnamon. Cinnamon? [Bobby] What other people don't know is, that no matter how horny Marco is, you know another thing he's into? Aside from womanizing, it's cooking. You really are like your dad! Truly a Kapampangan! A good cook, a tasty eater… and one hell of a womanizer! Okay, it's ready. Thank you. I'll ask you something. -I want to change course. -Change course? Marco, you've changed courses too many times already! -Ma, please listen to me, promise. -I'm listening! -I like Tourism. -Okay. Tourism? What do you want to be ?A tourist guide? Ma, promise. This is it. Promise. -Promise? -Yeah, right. [Bobby] Marco changes girls in a snap, just as fast as changing courses. -[Bobby] Hi. -Hi. [machine beeping] [Bobby] Intoy! Good morning, bro. This is the group's pride. Anthony Martinez. More popularly known as Intoy. He's the bad boy of the court. The idol! You call these grades? Do you even go to class? These are the grades of people who don't go to class. You know you have to maintain a GPA. [Bobby] A hero of the court, but a failure when it comes to class. [Monette] Intoy! Come here! Help me! My friends are here. ["Lagi Na Lang" continues playing] Hi! Time to eat, everybody! [customer] This looks yummy! Is this your son, Anthony? What a handsome boy! Of course. I was pregnant with him when I went to Boss Chan, so I could retire from the movies. Gosh, friend! That was years ago! That was a long time ago when you were still Mirinda Escolta! [laughter] [Monette] That's history. LICK IT CLEAN [Bobby] Okay. And my name is Robert John Fernandez. Friends and fans call me Bobby. I'm a chick magnet as well, but I choose to stay away from them. Troy, have you decided when to take the bar exams? This year, Dad. So I can finish it soon. But some of my classmates want to take a year off. In my case, I want to do it now, so I can get done and over with it. [Bobby's dad] That's good. How about you, Nicky? How's your internship? I'm at the cardio department now. Have you decided what your specialization is going to be? I have always been sure about that. Pediatrics, Dad. That's good. Dad, I just finished my short film. It's about a man walking in the street. I'm submitting it to the Quezon City International Film Festival. When can we see it, Bobby? [Bobby] Even if my dad hasn't approved of it, I'm still focused on my future career. I have my big dreams. [indistinct chatter] [Dondi] Here it is, Carla. I got you your favorite. Pasta. [chuckles] But before that, eat this one first. Um… Dondi… Mm? I have something to tell you. Actually… I have something to tell you. But before that, come on. Just one bite. Please? Uh… Wait, hold on! It's upside down. There. [Dondi] Is it good? What's this? Happy anniversary, babe! Is it good? I love you. [sighs] [gentle music playing] Dondi, I'm so sorry. But I think you deserve someone better. Let's go our separate ways. I'm really sorry. Goodbye. Hey, man. [Intoy] Hey, man, what happened to you? Carla was like, "You deserve someone better." -[laughing] -Damn! Fuck, man. I think I've seen that in the movies. [Bobby] I could've gotten there early. That's a good story for my short film. Fuck you! Fuck you, too! And one more "Fuck you" to you! Damn you all! [growls] -Hey, bro! -What's problem, man? [rock music playing] [glass clinking] [crowd cheering] [Marco] Hear me out, bro. I'm not being offensive, okay? But I think you're just lacking in… [laughing] You're a pervert! Asshole! Actually, you're right. -That's why she left. -Cheers to that. -Cheers! -You too! Hold on. -I have gifts for each of you! -Wait! I have to record this. Game! What now? Fuck you! Fuck you! And fuck you! Fuck you all! Fuck you! [Bobby] You really got no clue why she left you? -[Dondi] Bro, that's it. -[Bobby] But there has to be a reason. Because there is a reason. And you're the last to know? [Dondi] Look at that jerk. He's fooled another girl again. -Hi, boys. -Hey. Shirley and I will go ahead. My name is not Shirley. It's Eunice. -Okay. -Hi. -Hi! -We're heading out now. [rock music continues playing] Let's go? Let's go. -[Troy] That's right! -[Bobby's dad] Right. -It's good but Mom's cooking is better. -[Bobby] Hi, Dad. [overlapping chatter] [Bobby] Good night, Dad! Because of that, Dad will lose his worth. -[laughter] -The lettuce is no big deal. -It's just from the farm. -[Bobby's mom] Hmm. [Troy] But you know, honestly, just quit work and make us sandwiches. Sandra? Sandra! Sandra, Sandra! Dondi… Can I ask you something? [Sandra sighs] I know this is hard for you. But Carla and I have been best friends since grade school. [sighs] What do we do? Okay. Think of it this way. Carla's every move must have a definite reason. You already know that. That's it. She just left. [sighs] What would I think? Sands, I know you know something. I just want to know why. I don't think I'm in the right position to tell you. [sighs] So you know why. [sighs] Please. Just tell me. Is there a third party involved? Mm-hm. [exhales] What's his name? Sam. Sam? Sam… Sam? Who's Sam? There's too many Sam's in the world, man! [Dondi] That's the only name I got. So you want to get that Sam beat up when we get his full name? [Dondi] No need. When I see that Sam, I'll beat him up. Wow. So what's your plan? [Dondi] Bro, I'm telling you. I'm going to get my girl back. Even if it comes to death. You're crazy, man. You'll turn into a criminal for that girl? You know what? Just sleep on it. [woman] You're like your rotten goods! -Wait. I'll call you back. -[Dondi] Okay, okay. Tony, what's happening? Bro, they're mocking Mom's poster. They said Mirinda Escolta is a hooker. Who else but you! You! -Hey, there's no obscenities in my movie! -No? -[laughing] -[Monette] That's nominated in the Urian! It went to three film festivals abroad! [laughs, claps] Go on! Flaunt your obscenities to the whole world! You don't even know the father of your children! You! Do you know your father? -What about you? -Damn you, you bitch! [shouting] Who are you, anyway? What do you know about my life? I know a lot! If you don't want to eat here, then go somewhere else! -Then we'll go! -Thank you, baby. -We just want a discount! -Baby, let's go! -No one's stopping you! -Get out of here! -[woman] Whatever! -Rude! What the heck? I don't need your money! You damn people! -Go upstairs, Mom. -Don't you dare come back here! Was Mom's job really shameful, bro? [Intoy] Are you ashamed of it? -[Tony] No. -[Intoy] Then no. Do we have different fathers? My father is a seaman, that's what Mom said. While Aika's father is a stuntman she worked with before, in films. As for Maymay, I haven't asked. But the neighbors said… It's Mang Erning. He was our plumber. You know, paying attention to those gossipers makes you one, too. It's fake news. No. I confirmed it myself with Mom. She answered me. [guitar music playing] [student 1] Dude, I have this Math test, man. -It's so bad. -[student 2] Dude, I hate Math. -What class is that? -Science. -It's just the same thing. -Jesus. What triangular shape is this? -[student 1] Isn't that due today? -[student 2] No idea, man. Hey, guys. Help me with this. [Dondi] Bro, Carla replaced me with a good-looking guy. He has a car. He dresses well. I'm losing here. [Intoy] You know what they call that? Badass. [Dondi] You really have no class, man. -That's why we call you Intoy. -[Intoy] Shit, shit, shit. [Intoy] Here. Sam. -Sam. -[Dondi] That's him. [Intoy] Shit. He really is good looking! Hey, chicks. -[Intoy] Oh, shit! -[Dondi] What? [Intoy] Samantha… Sam! Man, that's her! Samantha Mercado, that's why they call her Sam! Man, Sam has no dick! [Bobby] She replaced you with a lesbian? -A girl who wants to have balls! -[laughs] But, man. Tell me, man. She looks handsome, right? Even Marco's going to be gay over her! Look! Fuck, man! She's so beautiful! See. Every time… Hey, why did she become a lesbian? Well, anyway, a lot of girls want to be lesbians nowadays. I think it's trending, man. Bro, at first, it did hurt me, But now that I found out she's a lesbian, it hurts even more. Bro, that's okay. At least, you know you did enough. She just changed her choice of flavor. [phone chimes] You're such a jerk. I won't answer. I won't answer it. -Hello, Trina. -You're such an asshole! -[Trina] Who's this? -It's me. Marco's friend, Intoy. -Where's Marco? I need to see him. -Sure, he'll meet you. Tell him it's important. -Jerk. -Okay. Where do you want? -Yes, he's coming. -I need to see him. Okay. [chuckles] -What's with you? You're crazy! -[laughing] Who's that Trina, anyway? [laughing] Long story, Bob. [Marco] We met a month ago. Bro, here's my fare. Sir. Are you interested? [Bobby] You met her while riding the FX? What kind of pickup is that? [laughs] Power! Follow me. All together! -[claps] -[all] Power! I thought my life had no meaning. Now I have my own car, house, and lot. -[claps] -[all] Power! Just like what I said earlier, your bright future is in your hands. So… Power! [Bobby] So she invited you to a networking business? Then you hit on her. I don't want my investment to go to waste. I already treated her for a burger. Should I give it to her for free? You're one of a kind, man! It's already budget meal, and yet you asked for an exchange. Bro, you're not getting the point here. The point is, she just got a taste of me, and now, she won't stop! [Bobby] What do you have, bro? -Magic balls? -That's not magic balls, it's black magic. [all laugh] -But, you know, man? -Asshole. Just talk to her to make things easier. To end it. Unless you want a round two, bro. Unless she wants a round two. [background chatter] [Bobby] Marco, is that her? -That's her? Are you serious? -Stay here, because this is embarrassing. -Stay put, okay. -She's looking at us! Why aren't you answering my calls? -I was busy. -Busy? Aren't you even going to ask how I'm going? Why would I do that? Are your temperature hot? Are you sick? You got out from a hospital? Oh, so that's just it? After flirting with me, after you took me somewhere and had a good time, it's now goodbye? That's it? Well, what were you expecting? You want to have fun. And we had fun. Fun? Is that how low you think of me? Fun? What am I? An Xbox? Pokémon Go? Hey! You're the father of this child. The father? Me? Okay, wait. Time out. That's a bad joke. You don't say that stuff. Okay? You're so stupid. I thought you had protection! [chuckles] Will you please stop joking? I don't like jokes. You're a jerk! I'm not forcing you to marry me. Shame on you! You're serious? Am I laughing out loud here? Fuck! Are you sure that's mine? Whoa! Shit! She slapped him, bro. [Marco] Trina! Trina! [Intoy] Then, I'll be the godfather! Fuck this friendship! I'm just 19! What if Mom finds out about this? I'm dead! -Man, are you serious? -I'm fucked, bro. Bro, why didn't you use protection? I thought you were the grand master when it comes to that. -Bob, I used one. -But what? It's loose? -What's your size? Extra small? -[all laugh] Your only prized possession is your face, the rest is… [all] …worth nothing! You assholes! Listen. Ask my exes. My girls… No one's complained, right? There's one. Trina. [all laugh] -Hey, hey. -Cheers to that. -Game. -[all] Cheers. [suspenseful music playing] Okay. Any comments? Reactions? No? Okay. Thank you, Robert. Okay. Next! Okay. Let's watch this. Ruby Rose Manalaysay. The title of my film is… Isang Kahig, Isang Tuka. It is an existential study of post-digital life. [clucking] -[clucking continues] -[indistinct chatter] [Ruby] You guys got scared? -What's your reaction? -It's really scary. [Bobby] Okay, bro. See you. -He's here. -[girls giggle] Hi! I think your film was sincere. Thanks. Yes. Even if it's derivative to the camera, highly influenced by Italian neorealism. Just like Visconti. But your shots are obviously influenced with Brillante Mendoza. Especially, your total disregard for using highlight… Ah, lighting as highlight, and using darkness as an alternative tension. In short, I thought it was brilliant. Really? I liked your work, too. [Ruby] So the violence isn't exploitative, prurient, and pandering? [Bobby] No. It's very Pasolini. Oh! I love Pasolini! Second to Lars Van Tier. But, honestly, you didn't find it disturbing? Honestly, not anti-chicken? Anti-chicken? Actually, there's a good deep meaning when it comes to a chicken. I hope PAWS will understand it. PAWS. What PAWS? PAWS. Philippine Animal Welfare Society. Since you cut the chicken open for the film. Ah! It was for the sake of art! Of course! And I salute you. Like what they say, "Amazing!" [giggles] Thank you! By the way, my name is Ruby. -I know. And I'm Bobby. -Bobby! I also know. Bye! Okay. -Mom, I'll do that. -What do you need? If it's money, then stop it. Come on! Money? Come on, Mom. I just want to help. Oh, well. I know what you're doing. Mom, can I ask you something? What? Who is my father? What's his job? Where is he now? You have too many questions! You're like Boy Abunda. You know what, just help me transfer this dish here. -[Monette] Here. -Mom, why do you answer if it's Tony who asks you? Why do you have to know your damn father's name? You said it already, he's my father. Diosdado Pindodo. What? That's the name of your father. Diosdado Pindodo. It sounds stinky, huh? Diosdado… Pin… Yeah, it's sounds stinky. That's one of the reasons I left him. I don't want to be Ramona Pindodo. It's so stinky! [scoffs] Son, you don't have to find him. Okay? I was able to raise you well, right? [beeps] -[Carla] Text me later, all right? -[Dondi] You know what I realized? All my life, I always follow other people's expectations of me. Even my pre-law course. [Intoy] You don't want to be a lawyer, so why are you still there? I know the answer. Because that's the course your father wants for you. And because Carla is studying law too. Fuck, man. You're such an idiot! You staying in a course you don't like, so you can be with her. Dude, I can't disappoint my dad. That's hard. -He wants me to finish law. -That's what he wants. What about you? What do you really want? [sighs] It's tough when you have an annoying dad. But it's even tougher if you don't know your dad. You know his name. Why don't you look for him? Fine. Find someone with the name, "Diosdado Pindodo." -Diosdado Pindodo… -Bro, Diosdado Pindodo? What a common name. That's why there's Facebook and Google, right? He's old. As if he has a Facebook account. Bro, my grandma's 80 years old. She has Instagram, and even Snapchat. What more with Diosdado? He has one for sure, bro. There! Diosdado Dinodo! Bro, it's Diosdado Pindodo. Look, Intoy. [Bobby] Anthony, your dad is so cool. -He has social media accounts. -[Intoy] Okay, I saw it. [Dondi] Bro, your dad's from Cebu. Let's see his pictures. [Bobby] Bro, chat him! Or you can even video call him. -Come on. -No. I don't want to. [scoffs] Let me do it. He's doing it. Online? -Online. -Bro, he's online. Don't let it pass. [Intoy] Good evening, sir… [Bobby] What kind of opening line is that? "Good evening, sir"? What do you want me to say? "Hi, Daddy"? -[dings] -[Bobby, Dondi] Bro! [Diosdado] Who is this, please? [Intoy] My name is Anthony, I am the son of Ramona Martinez. Do you still remember her? [Diosdado] Of course! How is she? How are you related to her? Bro! Reply! -Go reply! -Reply! [Intoy] I am her son, you are my father. [Bobby] Damn! Bro. This is a classic drama scene. Like an Olivia Lamasan film. [Intoy] Can we meet, sir, if you are in Manila? [Diosdado] I am in Manila. [Bobby and Dondi cheering] Wait a minute! You guys are way more excited than I am! [both] Bro! [Bobby] Go meet with him. [Marco's mom] Marco, do you know this Terry Palacios? She's Tessie's daughter. They live on the corner. -Yeah, Ma. -Their house has those bougainvilleas. -I think I know her. -Oh, you know her! Oh, well! She got pregnant! Oh, my! I don't get it! I don't understand. She's too young. Poor Mrs. Palacios. God! She's young! How old is she? Seventeen… -Sixteen. -See! Sixteen! [Marco's mom] She didn't even think about her parents. This generation is really shocking. [upbeat music playing] [elevator dings] [indistinct chatter] [Bobby] Hi! Hey. You're alone? -Do you have the third eye? -[both chuckle] Can you see other entities? That branding of yours is cool. Film student, or whatever you call it. -You always have a camera with you? -[Bobby] I'm making a film. My plan is to submit it to Cinemalaya this August. Or to Cinema One this November. Wow! Can I join? Are you serious? [Ruby] Your house is so beautiful! Daddy, hello. Hi, Mommy. Hi! I'm Ruby! [giggles] [Bobby] My friend, Ruby. You have such a nice home! [shrieks] Thank you. Sir, how's the French fries? What? Dad, I mentioned to Ruby that you're a French fries magnate. -Yes. -Troy! -This is my brother, Troy. Ruby. -Hi, Troy. Hello, Ruby. We'll go ahead. We'll just go upstairs to my room. We'll have to edit a video, a short film. Inside your room? Why not in the-- No, no! It's okay! Do not worry. We will be okay. Let's go, Bobby. -[Bobby] Okay. -Nice to meet you all! [Ruby] Bye. You'll let Bobby bring a girl to his room? Wait! I'm still confused! I don't know what to think. Hey! Wait! [mellow music playing] Anthony? Sir, nice meeting you. You don't have to call me "sir". Have a seat. You want to order something to eat? I'm good. Just drinks. Okay. Waiter. Coming, sir! -Yes sir? -I'll have the… [clicks tongue] …cold cuts platter and orange juice. [waiter] Okay. What's yours? -[waiter] Sir? -Orange juice too, please. How's your mom? She's doing fine. How about you? How are you? I'm good. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm just thinking… If you're my real father? Well, it's not every day you get someone to chat with you on the Internet and tell you he's your long-lost child… [Intoy] Here's me and my mom. [mellow music playing] [Bobby] That was taken in the year 1999. You can check the picture. I'm not fake news. We can't have a baby. So, you want me to have an abortion? You're crazy! This is a human being, not trash! It hasn't been three months. It's not yet developed. It's like larva. What are you saying? Are you crazy? This is a human being! Okay! Whatever you say! But what do we do? What about our future? What about my education? What about your plans of being a multi-millionaire in networking? Can we achieve all that if we have a child? We have no choice. [Diosdado] I've been going back and forth in Manila for my business. Sometimes three to four days. But my family… I have a family, Anthony. I'm aware of that. I saw it on Facebook. My family's in Cebu. What did your mom tell you about me? Nothing. When I found out she was pregnant with you, I told her to come with me to Cebu. You know your mom. She was a bit crazy then. She wanted me to stay here in Manila. But… Then, she suddenly cut off contact with me. Can I ask a question? Okay. Did you ever try to look for me? [Ruby] This is an easy one… "Love means never having to say you're sorry." [Bobby scoffs] Cheap. Love Story, 1970. Your games are easy. [Ruby] Starring? [Bobby] Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. [Ruby] And who played Ryan O'Neal's best friend in that movie? -[Bobby] Who else? Tommy Lee Jones! -[Ruby] Hey! You're something. You're good! You're the man! "You make me want to be a better man." As Good As It Gets, 1997! That's easy! Come on! "You… complete me." You're funny, you know. Even our maid can answer that! [Bobby] Then what? Jerry Maguire! -Oh, this one… -[Bobby] What year? Who played Fernando Poe Jr.'s mother in the movie Agila, directed by National Artist Eddie Romero? -Is there such a character? -Yes! You don't know? Gotcha! Amalia Fuentes! -[Bobby] Huh? Fuentes played FPJ's mother? -[chuckles] Yes! You can Google it! [Bobby chuckles] Ta-da! We're here! What are we doing here? [Ruby] Come! Let's go inside. [phone rings] I think I need to go. Sorry. If you need something or anything, you can contact me. Here's my contact details. It's nice meeting you, Anthony. Sir. Yes? Will we ever see each other again? If it's okay with you. You have my contact details. Or you can reach me through Messenger. [mellow music playing] -[Ruby] Look at all these VHS tapes. -[Bobby] We have a VHS player at home. In Daddy's study room. [Ruby] Huh? Has your dad been left behind by technology? [laughing] [phone rings] Hey, Marco. What's up, bro? [Marco] Bro, I just need your help. Maybe you can ask your sister. Oh, is this about the baby? No problem, bro. I'll just text you my sister's number so you could-- No, bro. I mean… This is confidential. Can you ask her yourself? We're planning to abort the baby. What did you say? Are you crazy? What did you buy this time? It could help. [scoffs] So now, you want to kill me too? I'm going home. I can't do what you want me to do. Wait. I have to decide too. I'm the father of that child. You're the father, but you want to kill your child. No thanks, Marco. If you don't want to be involved in this, that's fine with me. You only made this baby. You don't need to be the father. [Bobby's dad] Robert! What did you do? Who is this girl? -What? -Your sister told me! -Why are you shouting? -You called-- Ask your son! Dad, we're filming a short film. It's for a short film. -What? -The reason I called Nicki about abortion was because we're making -a project in school. -Stop! Will you stop your delusion of being the next Lino Brocka? Brillante Mendoza! I'm the next Brillante Mendoza! Fine! Stop your delusions of being a film director! Stop this insanity! Take Marketing! Business! Your tuition is so expensive! -I will not pay for that anymore! -Dad, this is art. Damn that art! You know what you'll end up? A videographer of weddings, debuts! I will put up a new franchise of Big Boy Frenchies at Solenad Town Center. You will manage that! [thuds] You want me to give up filmmaking to sell French fries? Yes! And you cannot tell us that we never gave you a chance. The grace period of this nonsense is over! This is not negotiable! Next semester, you will shift to Business Management! Or consider yourself an out-of-school youth! [thuds] Robert! We're not done yet! [Dondi] So, bro… What's your plan? I don't know. You don't know? [scoffs] Bro, is that acceptable? Bro, my mom will kill me if she finds out I got someone pregnant. In this day and age, no woman gets pregnant unless they want to. Wait, so you're saying she did that to force you? Bro, can you lessen your self-confidence, even a little? All I know is, she's stupid. Whoa. Really? So my mom's stupid too? She got pregnant without a husband. Intoy, your mom's different. Okay. Man, whatever you think or whatever you want to do, you're still the father. It won't happen if you didn't mess it up. It's really hard for a child to grow up without a father. [Intoy] Mom. Why are you frowning? It's still early in the morning. Mom? Do you know how much we have left in our savings account? And do you know how much we need to pay this month? Mom, don't worry. We will overcome this. I know. [Monette] All we can do is pray. If you wanna join us, It's okay, you wanna try? Maybe one. Francis. What's happening here? You didn't know? Biboy's short film got in QCinema. -Really? -Yeah. Let's go. [Francis] Biboy! [Bobby] Bro, congrats. [Biboy] Thank you! [Dondi] Bro. You also joined that film fest, right? That's okay. You will have your turn. And besides, you have much more appeal than him. [chuckles] Thank you, bro. [Dondi] You know we could still make things work again if we just try it. [Carla] Come on, let's go. -[Dondi] Please! Carla! -[Carla] Hurry up! Carla, I still want to fix this! Car… Carla! I know about Sam! -Guys, that's enough. -Really? -Wait. -Carla, let's go. -What do you know about Sam? -I know that you're just confused, over the events are that are happening. You're just finding yourself! But believe me, I can help you again find yourself. Dondi, that's enough! -I know you still love me. -Let's go, Carla. Carla, let's go. Carla. You still love me, right, Carla? Carla. Carla, Sam is also a girl! -Carla, let's go. -Wait. -So you think I don't know? -Sandra… -Carla, let's go! -Wait. Wait! So you think I don't know? What? Get real here, Carla! What? You think I'm going to expect you to love another girl? Come on. -You're going to settle for another girl. -Carla, let's go. You want me to believe that you're going to end up with that person? I'm here! Carla, don't settle for that girl! Wait! What do you know about love, Dondi? [breathes heavily] What do you know about me? You're right! Yes, I love her. I. Love. Her. And she's a girl! If you can't handle that, it's not my problem anymore. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. [sentimental music playing] -Carla. -Let's go. Carla! Carla! [Dondi] Isn't there a time machine so we could go back to grade school? -I've had enough of college. -[Marco] Cheers to that, bro. Hey, attorney! That's called depression, dude. Bro, she replaced me with a lesbian. Dude, I'll be a young dad soon. I won't find any girl to date anymore. -Please. -You're a jerk, you know? I'm not alone. -[Intoy] You guys are full of drama. -We can do this! [Bobby] He already has a baby, boy. Wait. What about… -Wait, wait! -What? -Does the baby have a name? -What? -Does your baby have a name? -Asshole! -[all laughing] -Bro! -Cheers, bro. -[Intoy] Cheers! [Bobby] Bro, we need to man up. [Monette] You can order now, okay? Son, take care of them. [Tony] Sure, Mom. [phone rings] Intoy! [Intoy] Mom. Your phone. [phone rings] -[Tony] Aika, bring it over. -[Aika] Okay. [Tony] The customer's waiting. And you? -Hello, sir? -[Diosdado] Hello? -Anthony? -Yes, sir? Can we meet? [line ringing] [operator] The subscriber cannot be reached, please try again later. Damn this woman. [Bobby] Have you watched this? Yeah, Franco Zeffirelli. The one I bought in Pasig, the pirated one. That's my grandma's favorite. -Have you watched… -By Baz Luhrmann? -Starring? -Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. [exhales] -Let's see if you're really good. -Hmm. Who's the actor who played Paris? -In the version-- -Hello! It's Paul Rudd! And who played as Tybalt? -John Leguizamo! -Mm! Who appeared with Guy Pearce in what Australian movie? You don't know, right? -No, I know! -No, you don't! You don't! Guy Pearce! [groans] To Wong Foo, With Love, Julie Newmar. -Yes, amazing! -[giggles] I know! [exhales heavily] We're really having fun. I think so too. What is it? No, it's nothing. Awkward. [giggles] What are you doing here? How did you find my house? I hired a PI to find where you live. Duh. I saw your Facebook post. So you're stalking me now? Let's talk. Another talk show again? To convince me? You, jerk! Bye! Hey, wait! Trina! Wait! -Get over here! -What? You… Stop with your drama! Get dressed. We're going out. You have one minute. Why is your tone like that? Is this a command? If you don't want to come, just tell me. Don't use this drama on me. If you don't want, suit yourself! [scoffs] -Hey! -[Marco] What? Come here. [Marco] Now, I have to do what you're saying? -What? -Can't you wait? -Stay there. I'll get dressed. -Hurry. Drama queen. See, you'll come. For you. Why are you on silent mode now? You're really something, you know? You invite me out, tell me to get dressed, just to take me here to eat ramen. [chuckles] What, you thought I'd take you to BGC? Please. You don't suit there. You're here because this is my favorite food. Please. So… How many girls have you brought here? Just you. But don't give it any meaning, okay? -You're not in a rom-com. -[scoffs] You think I'll believe you? Whatever you say… Have you told your parents? Not yet. Me neither. Tissue. I haven't told Mom. I can't get the right time. Are you going to push me again, to get an abortion? No. I'm okay now. You're right. Our child has nothing to do with this. Go eat. You have something on your face. [chill music playing] [Ruby] Why are you staring at me? I'm not staring at you. Oh, yeah! You'll tell me, "I'm just watching you eat fishballs so I can learn how to eat one." You're really different. Of course, look at me. I don't look like everybody else here. Then you should be in Japan. There's many people like you there. [chuckles] You know what, Bobby? I just really want to be me. I don't care about what other people say about me. Because I'm really happy to be me. You know what I mean? Better weird than boring, right? That'll be my motto forever. "Better weird than boring." Who wants to be normal? Eww, no way! You know what, Bobby? Nobody can tell you what can make you happy except yourself. Because if you believe what other people say about what can make you happy, chances are you'll end up just thinking that you're happy. -Yeah, really! So boring… -I'll go ahead… -[Dondi] Carla! -Hey, Dondi. Aren't you tired yet? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Okay, fine. Apology accepted. We good? -Bye-bye! -Wait, Carla! Remember, I'm just here for you. Okay? You know, Dondi… Look at yourself. You're beginning to look pathetic. [Intoy] Will you stop that? Bro, I only told her that because… I felt that it was right. Right? Man, you looked stupid. When did it become right? Bro, you don't understand. -Bro, I love-- -Man. Tell me again that you love her, and I'll punch you! I'll really punch you! Oh, God, now you're crying. -Man, come on. -[sobbing] Man, it's done. We can't do anything about it. She's done, then so be it. [cries] Bro… have I done something wrong? Man, nothing. Come on. You can't force it. And then what? You'll only look stupid. You know, man, let her do whatever makes her happy. Come on, bro. [sobs] [clinks] [Diosdado] Anthony, how old are you? Turning 19 in October. The reason I called you is because I want to tell you something. We want to help you. We have businesses in Cebu. Are you serious? What did your wife say? She knew I had a son, even before you appeared. She's the one who told me to find you. Your wife's really kind. Would I marry her if she wasn't? [both chuckle] Anthony, I want to give you something. [Marco] Let's go. -Wait! -What is it? Does your mom know I'm coming over? Why? You're nervous, huh? Of course! This will be my first time to meet the in-laws. In-laws? You're presumptuous. Hey, wait! Is somebody home? No one. My mom and my sister's in Nasugbu. They're staying overnight. You took me here to-- Relax. I brought you here to cook for you. Huh? You know how to cook? [quirky music playing] [Marco] Taste this. I'm sure you'll fall in love with me if you taste this. How is it? It's okay. That's all? Just okay? Now, you're the drama queen. [chuckles] [Ruby] Have you seen this? I don't think so. What? Are you serious? Pretty sure. Then we must get this! You should really watch this. Reese Witherspoon's amazing here! They're high school kids, and-- You should watch it! Why are you so quiet? Nothing. I said, why are you quiet? You're falling for me. Am I right? What self-confidence you got there! -No! -You can deny all you want! Come on. But I'm telling you this. I'm weird, but I'm cute and I'm smart. [chuckles] Miss, have you watched this? It's so nice! [laughing] [indistinct chatter] [sentimental music playing] [keyboard clacking] -Mom. -Mm. Where did you get this? Tell me you didn't steal this. Mom, why would I do that? Then, where did you get it? From Diosdado Pindodo. Mom, I got to talk to him. I know you have found Pindodo. He's the one who called you, right? I saw the caller ID. "Papa." Mom. -It's-- -"Papa"? Really? [sighs] Give it back to him. Tell Pindodo. There's no wake in this house, and we don't take donations. I can raise my children without that asshole's help. Mom. I didn't ask for this. He gave it to me. Why would he give you money? Payment for the years he left us and lived profusely in Cebu? -Together with the woman he married? -Wait! Why are you so mad? You're the one who dumped him! When he found out you're pregnant with me, he wanted you to come with him to Cebu. Then, you're the one who refused. So that's your damn father's story? And you believed him? He didn't leave us. He's a good person. I was able to know him. What do you know about being a parent? He never became your father. He just knocked me up! This? Give it back to him! If you want to believe your damn father, then go with him. Go with your Pindodo father! [Bobby] "I don't know how to say this." "I see you here a lot." "I think you're really pretty." "And I was just wondering if… you would go out on a date with me?" "Go away with me." You know that? Whiplash, 2014. Don't you have an original dialogue? But I'm not a scriptwriter. My strength is on visuals. Then why are you using those lines on me? Those lines? Actually, I'm just asking you out on a date. What? Haven't we been doing that? I just want to formalize things. Sure. No problem. That's all? You're being cheesy. -Cute but annoying. -[Marco] Who's this girl you like? Wait. [Marco] Let me put the face to this mysterious girl. Mm. Bro, I know her. Are you sure? Bro, I'm sure. I know she's different. Different? Bro, this friend of ours is something too, so they match! [laughing] [mocking laugh] Now, what? What will I do now? Seriously. Do you seriously want to know the secret? The secret is Rockwell, BGC, Highstreet, ATC, Ayala Alabang… The works, bro. It makes you classy. -For sure, you'll get her. -BGC? Why do I have to do that? Bro… [sighs] Will you just eat? We're here teaching you the works. -Hey! -Hi, guys! -Hello! -Hello. You've met Ruby, right? -I'm Marco. -Hi! We've seen her at the campus but never been introduced. Now, we're introduced. I'm Ruby. You must be the lawyer wannabe. -You're the lawyer wannabe? -Yes. -Hi. -I like this girl! Can we offer you a drink? -No, I don't drink but I can dance. -You wanna-- -Let's dance. -Let's go. Bobby, you're going to dance, bro? -Bobby? Dancing? -Not now, okay! Can I leave my bag with you? Thank you! -Yo! -Whoo! [all cheering] ["Tropa" by Mark Ortiguero, Adrian Mojado, Karlo Maglasang and Mark Atienza playing] Hi, Mom. Happy birthday. Hi, Marco. Thank you! Who is she? This is Trina, my girlfriend. You know what, Trina? Marco has never brought a girl home. You must be very special. Yes, Mom. Trina is special. [giggles] Oh, that's good. That's good. Mom, I have something to tell you. Trina's pregnant. You're dead. What did you say, Marco? What did you say? He said his girlfriend's pregnant, Mom. Miguel, please shut up. Okay? -I want to hear it from Marco! -Mom. Trina is pregnant. And I'm the father. [Marco's mom] How can you do this to me, Marco? Mom. On my birthday. Mom, I know. You know? You know, so why do you have to do this? I already warned you when you were still in grade seven! I told you to put a lock on your pants' zipper. Because that's the curse of your father's family. All of them are perverts! Maniacs! All of the girls they go with, or even hang out in the swimming pool, they knock them up! -[soft chuckle] -Don't laugh. I'm not joking. Mom. You said you wanted a grandchild? 2028! Not 2018, Marco! And now you're telling me that child is your birthday gift? How can you do this to me, Marco? [sobbing] On my birthday… [Bobby] So, yeah… The group's problems are fixed. The loverboy's slowly forgetting about Carla. I think he's now a heartbroken artist. The chickboy… It looks like he found his "The One". Another fuckboy turned good boy. The hardworking Intoy… is now getting to know his dad. And me… Determined that I will prove myself to be the Philippines' next important filmmaker. So good! Art! [Bobby] We thought everything was fine now. Until… [teacher] Do you think I'm playing with you? I don't care what your coach is saying. Or how important you are to Dean Garcia. Or whatever god there is at the Athletic Department. Ma'am, it's not like that. -So many things are happening-- -Martinez! Tell me, is that my problem? No, ma'am. Students who graduate in this university aren't only good in playing ball. They should also know how to use their brains! [coach] I warned you. I can no longer do anything about it. It's embarrassing to the dean! Study. I'll excuse you from practice. Good luck. Remember, your scholarship depends on it. [Intoy] I don't think I will ever have a chance to score high in Ledesma's class. [Marco] No, bro. -Why don't you take Ledesma on a date? -[Bobby laughing] -Jerk! -You can do it! You're good! She smells like formalin! That's too much. -Then you date her! -Jeez. -No, wait. -Even that? Bro, that's Behavioral Science, right? Yes, why? During midterms, Ruby got close to the secretary of Behavioral. So wait… Who's Ruby? My girlfriend. Wow, you're really proud! "My girlfriend". Good for you! Hear me out. Ruby found out that the secretary's sister is her godsibling. Now, they know each other. They get to chat, even. Are you following the narrative? It's become a big cast. [chuckles] Listen, bro. The secretary said… Usually, the day or the night before, the professors email me the questions for the exams. Then, when I get to the office, I transfer it to the folder of each professor. I just open the folders when I have to duplicate it or print it out. So each teacher has their own folder? Of course, so their files are separated. A lot. [Bobby] Included there is Ledesma. So what, bro? Let's plan this. [Intoy] How? When we finally get Ledesma's folder, you will receive the questions the night before the exam. Man, that sounds dangerous. You and your girlfriend will get involved. There's no hassle, bro! Believe me! Bro, trust Bobby. Okay. How will you hack the secretary's computer? Not me. But to Ruby, that's a piece of cake. There! We got in the department's account! But you need a user ID and password. You know the secretary's user ID and password? All the students' user IDs start with their last name and underscore, their first name. Menchie's last name is Amante. And her first name is Carmen. But what about the password? That's the most important part. Password should be a minimum of eight characters. Including letters and numbers. So let's try this. The name of her boyfriend is Troy. But she calls him Batchoy. Her birthday is July 6th. So let's try this. User ID, amante_carmen, password, batchoy0706. [both gasp] -[screams] -Yes! -Hey, Bobby! -Bro Study this well. And be careful. After using that, destroy it. If not, bro, we're dead. Th-- Thank you. Sure, bro. I don't think you'll flunk now. And don't answer it all correctly. You might get busted. -We'll go ahead, bro. -[Ruby] Mm-hmm. [Trina] Marco, tell me the truth. What is it? Are you just playing nice because you knocked me up? Why, what reason do you want? Mm. You're nice to me because you got caught up in my problems. [chuckles] You know, you're full of drama. Didn't it cross your mind that I like you? Wow. [chuckles] If I didn't fall for you, would you think I'd come with you and treat you to a snack? And you eat a lot, you know! Hey. Don't believe this jerk here. He's a chickboy, that's why I got pregnant. [laughs] [suspenseful music] [bell rings] [suspenseful music continues] [teacher] Martinez. Anthony Martinez. What is that? [man] Mr. Martinez. This evidence is enough to get you expelled from this school. Did you know that? I'm very disappointed with you, Martinez. I've been here for 30 years. You didn't even treat me with respect! Tell me. Where did you find my test exam questions? Ma'am, it didn't come from me. I have no idea how he was able to acquire it. Who helped you get the questions for Dr. Ledesma's exams? No one. Tell me, Martinez. No one. [deep sigh] Okay, this is what we're going to do. Tell me the students involved and I will not expel you! Just suspend you and all of those involved! No one, really. I'm the only one who took it from the secretary's computer. I hacked her computer to get the data. [footsteps] -Mom, I did-- -No. Don't talk to me. I'm still mad. Why did you do that? Mom, I was going to fail. That's why you chose to cheat. Who helped you steal the test questions? No one, Mom. [breathes deeply] Don't fool me. I pushed you out of my womb. I know you. You have no guts to do that kind of nonsense. And hack the computer of that woman's secretary! Tell me that truth. Who helped you? Mom, as I said, there's no one. Intoy, if you don't tell them the truth, you'll be expelled. It's not only your scholarship that will be canceled. You will also be kicked out of the school. There's no better place for you to study. What will happen to you? Hmm? [Dondi] Did you hear what happened to Intoy? Why? Is something wrong? Bro, he's dead. His classmate in Stat said he was caught cheating in his exams. -Oh. -[sighs] He got busted in cheating? He's so stupid! [Dondi] What did Intoy do, bro? Bro, I have no details with what happened. I just have this friend. He's Intoy's classmate in that class. -Then he said-- -[phone ringing] [Marco] Bob. -Hello? -[Dondi] Bobby! Ruby? Bobby, where's your friend, Intoy? Just steady. What happened? Menchie texted me, the Behavioral's secretary. She's under investigation because Intoy was caught cheating in the exams. I know what happened. I'm with Dondi and Marco. [Ruby] Don't you get it? If Intoy admits where he got the… …the questions, we'll be in trouble! I'll handle it. Bro, why are you looking pale? Nothing, bro. [keypad clacking] -Who are you calling? -It's Intoy, bro. [operator] The subscriber cannot be reached. Let him be. Bro, this is different. What's really your problem , Bob? Ruby and I are the ones who took the test questions for Intoy. Bro, if he talks, we're in trouble. Damn it, Bob. You're both jerks! [sighs] [sighs] Bro, I can't reach him. I think his phone's off. Bobby's crazy. He knows Intoy's not smart, but still he made him do a stupid thing. Dude, he was just trying to help. -Trying to help? -Yeah. And what now? Intoy got caught. We know he's stupid. Bro, "stupid" is a little intense. Our friend is just a good person. That's why he doesn't know how to cheat. Unlike you, you're an expert. Dondi. -You're a jerk. -[chuckles] Fine, bro. Convince yourself you're not. [indistinct chatter] [Monette] Intoy… Are you okay? Mom, you're crazy. I'm going to be expelled from school, and you're asking me if I'm okay? Come on. I just thought of something. -I'll talk to Valdez once again. -No, Mom. Please. I'll explain it. I'm good at acting, you know. I got nominated at the Star Awards. Even in the Urian, for Best Actress. Mom, that's Mirinda Escolta. Not Monette Martinez. That will do. Mom, their accusations are correct. I cheated. Unfortunately, I got busted. [sighs] [sighs] I don't understand. Why did you do that, Intoy? It's done, Mom. I'm not used to cheating. I got busted right away. You still didn't answer my question. Why did you do that? [sentimental music] I don't want to lose my scholarship. I'm good at playing, but I'm stupid. I'm stupid in Math. I had no choice, so… I cheated. Don't worry. We will find a way so you can finish college, okay? Mom, don't talk to the dean. It's embarrassing. -I won't. -Mom. What will you do? Whatever. Your mom can find a way. I might go back to make movies. Oh, God, Mom. People are not ready for the comeback of… Mirinda Escolta. They won't be able to handle it. [both chuckle] [laughing] [sentimental music continues] We never know. Monette. [chuckles] Daddy Dads. [chuckles] Daddy Dads. I haven't heard that in a while. You haven't changed. [clicks tongue] You're still a player. [chuckles] You got my cellphone number from Anthony? No. I stole it. I looked for your cellphone number when he was in the shower. He has no idea I'm going to meet you. [laughs] You're scary. You should be scared. [teammate 1] Intoy, are you okay now? Why do you guys keep asking me that? They said you got under Ledesma's skin. [teammate 2] Last sem, Edith, from the women's basketball team flunked too. That's why she got kicked out of the team. She plainly just hates athletes. Even me, she always puts me on the spot. -Are you serious? -Martinez. Come here. [coach] Martinez! Coach. [coach] Why did you do that? You won't answer me? You don't have an explanation? Coach, I'm sorry. It's my fault. I'm sorry. [Monette] Nineteen years have passed. I've never asked centavo from you. [Diosdado] Did something happen to Anthony? He has a problem in school. The kid wants to study. He doesn't care if he's dead tired in volleyball just to get the scholarship. But he's in trouble with studies. Daddy Dads, my son got kicked out of school. I don't know what to do. Can you help us? [Trina] They say, in Greek Mythology, the human being is originally created -four arms, four legs, heads, and faces. -[Marco] Four arms? You would look ugly. Listen to me first. Zeus got disturbed with their power, so what he did was, he split them into two separate parts. That's why we look like this! We have to live finding our lost halves, the missing part of us if Zeus didn't split us apart. Hmm-mm. -That's really… -Hey. -Buying ice cream while I'm talking here. -Two, please. Thank you. -You weren't listening. -I'm listening. You're too sensitive. -Here's one to keep you cool. -[groans] See? It's like this. -Am I right? -Perfect! Do you believe in soulmates? [scoffs] Maybe, since there's two popsicles stuck together. But if you split them… [Marco] Trina. Are you okay? [groaning] [Marco] Doc, what happened? I cannot tell you the exact ideology because there could be a variety of reasons why miscarriage happens during the first trimester of pregnancy. But what's most important right now is that we have controlled the bleeding. I'll continue to monitor her vitals and then… We'll take care of her. I'm so sorry. [sniffles] [somber music playing] [sniffles] [kissing] [Trina's dad] You called me? -I'm sorry. I don't mean to… -What are you saying? You ruined my daughter's life! [Dondi] Sir, enough! [Trina's dad] Hey! Is he your friend? Tell him this! Don't you ever come near Trina! I don't want to see him with my daughter! If I do, I'll kill him! [Trina's dad] Where's Trina? -[groans] -Are you okay? He's such an asshole. [Dondi] Dad. What time is it? Where have you been? I was with Marco. There was an emergency. What's the emergency? It doesn't matter. That's what I've been saying. Those friends of yours will ruin your studies. Dad, how can you say that? Lie all you want. Look. What does this mean? Huh? You go to school every day, and yet you have withdrawn from three subjects already. Huh? Dad, you have to go through my stuff too? You're asking me? I'm the one who pays for your tuition, for your studies. Am I right? You should have told us why you dropped subjects this semester. Dad! I'm done with Law! What the hell are you talking about? Dad, being a lawyer is your dream. Not mine. And I just realized I can never live your dreams for you. I can only live mine. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. You don't know how much you've hurt and disappointed me, Dondi. [mellow music playing] -[Bobby] Dude. -Hey, man. Bro, the group's been calling you. We can't reach you. I have no load. [scoffs] For two days? Intoy. Ruby and I have a request for you. Man. Everything's good. You don't have anything to be scared of. I'm not that kind of person. I don't tell on people. I'm sorry for what happened. [Intoy] We're good. It's not your fault. I'm just stupid. Let's just move on. [light music playing] What's your plan anyway, bro? I don't know. I'll stay here for the mean time. Out-of-school youth. [both chuckle] [Bobby] I got to talk to Intoy. [Ruby] What did he say? -He won't talk. -[relieved sigh] -Bobby. -I know. Let's go. Is this my costume? [sniffs] Shit, Bobby. It stinks! Did you get this T-shirt from a funeral home? Of course! You're a beggar! Have you seen a beggar who just got out of the shower? That's not a beggar anymore! That's the problem. You don't read the script. Bobby, this character just walks around. He does nothing but walk around! It's because this is deep! This is what we call film! Not that commercial stuff! You're such a prima donna, Winston! Stand here on your marker. Here. -What will I do? -Walk towards that direction.* -Kick this one. -Go! Fuck this film! [Winston] Why the hell did I accept this role? They only feed me biscuits here. Fuckers… Hey! You don't appreciate this! This is what we call art! You're a commercial sell-out, that's why! [keypad clacking] [mellow music playing] [phone chimes] [Marco] Trina. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I can't be there for you. Are you okay? Please text me back. I miss you. [deep sigh] Marco, let's go. What are you still doing there? -[Bobby] What are you doing here? -[Dondi sighs] Bro, wear this. This suits you. Bro, stop emoting. It doesn't suit you. -Wear this. -Come on. We're giving it to you. [Marco sighs] Where are we going? -I really look good, right? -[Bobby] No doubt! Sir, why did you invite me here? Have a seat. Have you thought about my offer? As I've said, my wife knows about you. That's not the problem, if that's what you worry about. And if you still want to continue your studies, -I know people in various colleges-- -Sir, wait. You know about what's happening? [sighs] Your mom talked to me. How did you two talk? She told me about what happened. That's why I want to help. You will have a better chance if you come with me to Cebu, Anthony. Thank you, sir. I appreciate all of this. And they call me Intoy, not Anthony. [chuckles] [Marco] Hey. -What are you doing here? -Nothing. Nothing? But you're here. [Marco] Mm-hmm. I'm here because… I love you. I said, I love you. No reaction? -Really. -[chuckles] Is that what you answer to an "I love you"? "Really"? Are you serious? [uplifting music] [whispers] Don't forget your payment. I believe in "The One", for your information. Mm? And of course, there are three here, so you know what that means. So how was it? Smooth, huh? Barely. You and your friends are so cheap. [boys cheering] -Is it good? -[Dondi] Nice! They're back together. [chuckles] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Hey, slowly. You might break it again. -You guys sleep early. -[Tony] Of course. Have you eaten? It's already dark. Why are you late? I had a meeting, Mom. Meeting? You're big time now. [both chuckle] What are you doing? You're like a cat! Don't hug me. I stink! Intoy. Mom. [sentimental music playing] Just… do what's good for you. I'll be happy for you. That's it. I know what you did. You thought I wouldn't find out? He told me. You're snooping around on my phone. [chuckles] That's my right. I'm your mother. So when are you leaving? Huh? Who's leaving? Why? Would I leave my international actress of a mom? And my siblings? [breathes deeply] -Intoy. -Mom. I have lived my 19 years of life without a father. I can't leave my mom just for that reason. You don't want to go with him? Why would I go with him? Is he an award-winning guy? -Is he nominated somewhere? -[clears throat] Why are you crying? Are you crying? No! That's just acting! Your mom's nominated in the Urian! You sap. [Carla] He wants to give her freedom, but she doesn't want to. She only wants space. [Sam] You know? [Carla] Like… She only needs time, yeah. -So that's what happened. -Then? Um, Sam, this is Dondi. And Dondi, this is Sam. Sam, bro. Dondi. -Nice to finally meet you. -Thanks. -So I have to go. -Okay. -Okay. Take care, bye. -All right. [Dondi] Actually… you look good together. -See you guys. -[Sam] Um, thanks. Huh? [uplifting music playing] [girl] Nice, right? Bye. [all] Happy birthday! [Monette] Come here! I thought you guys were going to ditch your friend's birthday! We won't do that! [Intoy] Those guys? [all cheering] -[Marco] One, two, three, start! -[boys] It's Intoy's birthday! [Bobby] The group's more than six years old now. But our friendship and experiences seem longer than that. Dondi Dela Cruz got hooked on drawing and graphic arts. He also has moved on from Carla.
