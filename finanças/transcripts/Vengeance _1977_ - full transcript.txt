(gentle country music) - [Man] Nice shooting, son. - Thanks, Pa. - I think we better be doing some real hunting. (gentle country music) - Pa. - Yeah? - You think we're gonna catch anything today? - Well, I imagine we are, son. We just have to keep real quiet now, look real good along in here. (gentle country music) Good shooting, son. (rabbit squeals) - Pa? Pa? - [Pa] Yep? - Do you ever really get used to killing? - [Pa] Well, killing's one thing, hunting's another. - I suppose, but I can't rightly see the difference. - Well, the difference is, hunting is for eating purposes. Uh, if you didn't kill this here rabbit, it's likely a hawk or a coyote would. It's just right and proper. Now, of course, if you was to just kill it and leave it, for no good reason, why, that's not hunting. That's killing, and that's wrong. (gentle country music) - Hey, Mama, the rest of those biscuits ready yet? - [Mama] Yep, they're coming along. - Good. - A little more milk in here, honey, just a little. Whoops, lovely. - [Girl] It's gonna be a hot one today. - [Mama] It sure is. - Ooh, oatmeal and biscuits. Why, the scent of it is enough to bring a man in. - [Boy] And start a belly talking. - [Mama] You feeling ill, Tom? - Oh, it's nothing that ain't natural. - [Boy] I hunted it down myself. - Good, we'll be having stew! (graceful western music) - [Man] Hey, you! - Me? - Yeah, you. What are you doing in my town? - That's some kind of welcome. - Ain't no welcome. It's a warning. Now pick up what you need, and I want you outta here in one hour. - One hour. - One hour. - That's a handsome watch. Mighty. Excuse me, that's clumsy of me. (men laugh) (gentle country music) - Now, you just make your mark right here. Know how to sign your name. I see you've had some schooling. That's more than most around here can say. (ominous instrumental music) I suppose there's more where these came from. I can't hear you. - But I heard you. - [Banker] Quality like that oughta bring you in 10, maybe $11 an ounce. Like I said, we'll find. - 10 to 11 an ounce, woo whee! Congratulations, Isaac. - You did real well, Isaac. - You been up there in them hills for so long there, we figured you were gone. - Now, now, Dewey, be nice to old Isaac here. I guess he's a bit shy, being with real people again. - We just ain't plain old people, Grover. We're more like friends. - Friends, shoot, we're more than friends. Naw, I'm thinking of taking on Isaac here as a partner. - Right, partners. - [Grover] A partner, that's the way that is. - He should be thanking us. - No, no, there's no need here for thank yous. No, I'd worry myself to death about old Isaac here, having to take care of all that money. You see, Isaac, gold means money, and money, that takes looking after, and looking after something means responsibility. What do you know about responsibility? Now I know about responsibility. So I'm gonna be responsible now, help you carry that old bag right out here. Let me see it, pardner. (gun bangs) - What'd you do that for, Dewey? - Shoot him, you blind toad! - Put your guns down. Just slide them over here. Now get down on your bellies. - George? Brother George? (tense instrumental music) George is dead, Grover. - [Grover] I know that. You shot him yourself, you blind. (tense instrumental music) - The black one is very good. He make three of them lie with their face on the floor, and there was another one there. He was dead but I don't know how. - Did you see what was worth dying for? - The black one have something in his saddlebag, but I do not know what. There was, there was another man there, hiding, like a woman. Maybe he knows something. - Let's go ask him. (wind whistles) - [Isaac] There's no need for that, mister. I ain't bringing no trouble. I'd appreciate a little water for my horse, and I'll be on my way. - You're riding pretty hard there. - [Isaac] Well, I got a lot of ground to cover. - Some hot coffee won't keep you back none, and you'll profit by it later on. - Well, I do have the taste of dust in my throat, ma'am. Like I said, mister, you don't need that. - Well, I'm Matthew Thirsten, and this here's my boy Tom. - Tom. - Hi. - My wife Beth, and our daughter Lisa. - And my name is Isaac. Well, I gotta be getting on. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. - [Matthew] Good luck, Isaac. - [Lisa] Isaac, here, take these along for later. - [Isaac] Thank you, Miss, they'll come in right handy on the trail. Adios. - [Lisa] Bye. - Pa, can I go hunting in the canyon? - Chores are done, I suppose. - [Beth] Don't go wandering too far. Your pa will have to come looking for you. - Don't worry, I've been learning things. - That boy's growing up, Beth. (graceful western music) (gentle instrumental music) Well, you know, that boy, he can track an animal over dry rock better than most men. - He's probably out there sleeping under some tree, dodging his chores. - [Matthew] Now, don't you go belittling your brother like that. His learning's gonna save me some time for some other things. (graceful western music) Lisa, get into the wagon. - What is it, Matthew? - Do I have to? - Do as I say, and quickly. Don't you come out until I tell you. (graceful western music) - Good day. I said, good day. - Good day. What do you want? - We're friendly, just people. - [Matthew] We don't have much money. - We don't want your money. - Then go away, leave us be. - [Matthew] Look, I don't want any trouble. You take what you want and leave. (thugs chuckling) - Very good. Very good. But hardly enough to feed all these hungry men. Jesus! (Jesus speaks foreign language) - [Leader] Kill the cow. (laughing) (gun bangs) - Beautiful ring. (laughing) (men chattering and laughing) - [Thug] Ready, amigos? (guns bang) (wind whistles) (chuckling) (grunting) (wind whistles) - Now I will celebrate my birthday. Music, lend me your music! - Come, old man, show us. - [Old Man] Come, senora, we will dance! (guitar music) - I think she is too strong for you. (laughs) - [Beth] Please, don't. (guitar music) - Enough! I think it's time I found out just what kind of a woman you really are. (chuckles) Jesus. (Jesus speaks foreign language) - No, for God's sake! Don't, don't, please. Please! No, please, don't. (wind whistles) No! No. (grunting and whimpering) No. (grunting) No! (whimpering) No! (whimpering) (laughing) (shouting) (gun bangs) Matthew! Matthew. You bastard. (gun bangs) (dramatic instrumental music) (wagon rattling) - McClain! McClain! I 'll meet you at Teeva Canyon. I forgot something. (melancholic instrumental music) (tense instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) (melancholic instrumental music) (shouting) (wagon rattling) (jittery instrumental music) - No! (exciting instrumental music) (shouting) - Where the hell did you come from? Who are you? - You killer, go to hell! - (chuckles) I probably will. (melancholic instrumental music) - I'll get them. I'll get them. (melancholic instrumental music) - Hey, amigo, the wagon's full of surprises. Water, supplies, and the most valuable possession. - All sorts of possibilities. - He wants to be pretty for his senorita, eh, Lupe? - And why not? I think she likes me already, huh? - Oh, (speaks foreign language), amigo. I see how her love burns for you. - Well (speaks foreign language). What are we going to do with you? - Would you like a drink, senorita? - Concerned for her welfare, eh, Ricky? That's good. - I just wondered how long she has been in the wagon without water. - Ricardo here is responsible for watering the horses. You can understand his concern. Now haven't you got anything to say for his kindness? Well, I guess you got your answer, Ricky. When she's ready, she'll drink. Don't you usually find it that way? - With the horses, (speaks foreign language). - Ricardo's very young, but don't make a mistake. He's not much different than the others. He'll buy and sell you for a peso. You're wondering what we're gonna do to you, aren't you? Aha, a reaction. (tense instrumental music) (graceful western music) - [Thug] Tastes good. (Ricardo speaks foreign language) - Rick, go see if the rest of the men are fed. Looks like you made yourself a friend. Hey, I'm talking to you. - You planning on killing me? - [McClain] Eat your food. - I don't want anything from you. - Lisa. (tense instrumental music) - Orlando's horse. - But where is Orlando? (tense instrumental music) - Orlando! - Orlando! - Maybe something happened to him. - Well, if so, it was long in coming, eh? (tense instrumental music) - Check the saddlebags. (dramatic instrumental music) (groaning) (dramatic instrumental music) (gun bangs) (dramatic instrumental music) - No, don't. Don't do it! (gun bangs) (moaning) We better find him before sundown. - [Man In Huge Hat] If he's still alive. (shouting) (melancholic instrumental music) (Beth whimpering) (dramatic instrumental music) (laughing) (wind whistles) (tense instrumental music) (wind whistles) (snoring) - Pablo, hey, Pablo, get up. - [Pablo] What? - Hey, hey, wake up. Wake up. Come on, we gotta find Orlando. (wind whistles) (screaming) (jittery instrumental music) We better split up. We'll have a better chance to find him. - We better find him together. - No, you go that way. I'll go this way. We'll meet back here at sundown. Adios. (shouting) (jittery instrumental music) (soft instrumental music) (wind whistles) (Paulo speaks foreign language) (wind whistles) (tense instrumental music) (gun bangs) (shouting) (gun bangs) (wind whistles) (dramatic instrumental music) (wind whistles) (tense instrumental music) (lonely instrumental music) - [Tom] Do you ever really get used to killing? - Killing's one thing, hunting's another. (lonely instrumental music) - Well, I did it, I got him. (groans) Hold it, hold it! (grunting) Hold it! (grunting) Hold it! (grunting) - Look at that, goddamn, we rich. That Grover's something else. You hear that, brother George, you're rich. Hey, Grover, how much you got there? Come on, tell me. - Well, this stuff's pretty rich, huh? I'd say it's gotta assay over 200 pounds. - 200 pounds, don't, you'll spill that. That's 200 pounds, Dewey! - How much would I get, Grover? How much money will I get? - Well, let me think here. I gotta figure this out. If it's 200 pounds, and this is a guess. - [Man] Don't worry about it yet. - [Grover] That'll be eight or nine there for each of us. - Eight or nine? Doggone! And we're gonna double that within a year, you know. - [Dewey] That's right! - And we don't have to share with that partner right there. Ain't you glad that I saw them boys ride into town, Grover? - Hey, aren't I glad. - Eight or $900. - No, no. - No? - No. $1,000. - Thousand? - Thousand? - Thousand! Eight or $9000 for each one of us! - You mean to tell me this wheelbarrow's got eight or 9,000 just for me? - [McClain] No! - We've got more partners. - Go into the mine. (guns bang) - Ow! (guns bang) (rattling) - Well, you got my gold. You might as well set me free. - Set you free? You know I can't do that. But you might get lucky, and then maybe you could mine us out some more gold. We'll be back and see you again. Jesus! (Jesus speaks foreign language) - Inside, he says Jesus, kill that man, kill him! But in here, I know I will not do it. So I gift you your life. Adios, amigo. (dramatic instrumental music) (guns bang) (graceful western music) (wind whistles) - Hey, boy. It's me, Isaac. Remember? Come on, put the gun up and cut me loose. - I ain't cutting anyone loose. You're probably one of the gang. I should kill you! Now you tell me where my sister is, right now. - Look, I'm not one of the gang, and I don't know where your sister is. - You know all right. - You gotta believe me. I don't know where she is. - Why should I believe you? You're probably with those outlaws. - Come on, use your head, boy. Would I be tied up like this if I was one of them? Huh? - I don't know. I can't tell anymore. - What's wrong with you, boy? What you doing out here anyway? Where are your folks? - They're dead. Those men killed them. - I'm sorry. I don't blame you for not trusting me. But as you can see, I'm not one of them. So come on and cut me loose. Maybe I can help you. - When you rode into our camp, you looked like you were riding pretty hard. Were they after you then? - I never seen them before. That one over there and his friends were after me and my gold. - Well, then they've got my sister. - Yeah, and they've got my gold. Three hard years of pick-splitting rocks. - Ain't you going after them? - Yeah. I've been thinking about that. It's a lot of them. Odds are kind of heavy. If I'm gonna get killed, I guess I'm gonna do it alone. Come on, I'll take you into town first. - No one's taking me into town. What about my sister? - There's nothing a boy your age can do about that. Now, come on, I'll get you settled. Tom! Now where do you think you're going? - [Tom] I don't think anything. I'm going after my sister and those men. - You don't know what you're doing. They'll kill you as soon as look at you. - Maybe, but if I die, it won't be alone. - I think it's all clear now, Grover. - Ned, what the hell are you doing? - [Ned] I'm just gonna signal for help, Grover. - You jackass, you'll have them back here on us. Oh, my foot is killing me. Ow, ow! God, Ned. - [Ned] Grover, I'm trying to take your boot off without hurting you now. - Hurt me, you're damn near killing me. - [Ned] Aw, Grover, now come on. - [Grover] Ow! - [Ned] There. That wasn't so bad, was it? (moaning) Grover. Grover. - I didn't go no place. - Where's your two toes, Grover? - My toes? Oh, no, not my toes. Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, God. - Well, it's better your toes than your fingers. I think that's kind of lucky. - Help me up on my feet. I gotta think of way we can get our gold back. Ow, ow, you're on my foot! - I was not on your toe! - Get away from me! Get away from me! - [Ned] I didn't stand on your toe. (gentle instrumental music) - [Lisa] Isn't that part of an Army officer's uniform? - That's right. - [Lisa] How did you ever get it? - Well, by taking it off of the officer that wore it. Oh, he was a bad one. Besides, it fits me better anyway. - [Lucy] Well? - Well What? - [Lucy] Well, tell me the rest of the story. Did you rape his wife? - Now-- - Did you kidnap his children? - No! You weren't kidnapped. - [Lucy] That's right, I hid in the back of the wagon, and if I hadn't-- - If you hadn't, you'd have been dead, and I'd probably have been better off. Your father was a fool. - For trying to protect his family? - For dying to protect them! For dying. - Don't you touch me! - Now, I wouldn't try anything stupid, like running away or something. - Well, if I were you, I'd keep me tied up cause the first chance I get, I'm gonna get outta here. - Now you're not gonna last half a day out there alone. You're too soft. - Get away from me! I can't stand the smell of you! I can't stand the smell of your stinking men! I can't even stand the smell of myself. - All right. There's a river right down over there. You can bathe. - Oh, your friends would just love that. - Ricardo. Ricardo, will you take this young lady down to the river and see that she's not bothered? - Well what about him? - Him? He's a gentleman. - And you're a snake. - And you're asking for trouble. - I'm asking to be left alone. - Ricardo, take her down to the river. (laughing) - [Lucy] Ricardo. (Ricardo speaks foreign language) What's gonna happen to me? - [Ricardo] No questions, please. - Ricardo, please, tell me. - You ask me things that I cannot answer. - Or you won't. - It's the same. You see, my grave would be covered in 10 minutes if McClain knew we even talk about these things. - Why are you afraid to tell me? - Not afraid, senorita, wise. - But nothing's gonna happen to you. - [Ricardo] That's enough. All right, if you must know, I tell you. The prisoners are sold. - Sold? - [Ricardo] (speaks foreign language) sold to the highest bidder. - Like cattle. (laughing) (guns bang) - Who are you? What do you want? - [Ned] What? - [Grover] Don't say a thing. - [Ned] Grover, he asked what we wanted. - [Grover] And you're gonna tell him the gold, I suppose. Then he'll know where we are and plug us for sure. - Martin, circle around. (gun bangs) Enough! (exciting instrumental music) - [Grover] Ow! - Shh! (Grover moans) Grover, will you be quiet? We're right on top of them here. (dramatic instrumental music) - They could not have vanished. We are cursed with death by a devil who goes up in smoke! - Those men are real, Jesus. And we'll see them again, Maybe next time they won't be so lucky. (laughing) (tense instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) (groans) (dramatic instrumental music) (exciting instrumental music) (lonely instrumental music) - You are very foolish to try and run away. If one of the other men would catch you alone. - Let me go! - That, I cannot do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (lonely instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) (wind whistles) (tense instrumental music) (groaning) - Thanks, Isaac. Thought I was a goner. - Yeah. - I don't know what's going on around here, but, by God, I'm gonna find out. Put out that fire! The smoke can be seen for miles. Jesus, what do you make of this? - McClain, the work of the devil. - They've got her all tied up. - Easy, boy. - But they're leading her around like an animal. - Take it easy. - I'm going after her! I'm gonna kill them all! - You're gonna get yourself killed if you don't take it easy. Now, you can't help your sister by going running off. So think, boy. Maybe we can do something about it. - [Boy] McClain is here! McClain, he is here! My papa is back! My papa is back! (bell tolls) (graceful western music) (cheering and shouting in foreign language) (bell tolls) - Where is Juan? (sobs) - [Boy] Papa! - Hey, Joe. Hey, you been a good boy? Have you? (sobbing) Adios (speaks foreign language). (graceful western music) Carmella, Carmella. The whole town came out to greet me, and where was my Carmella? - Exactly where you want me to be. - Now I'll show you what's worth waiting for. - [Tom] What do you think they're gonna do with Lisa? - [Isaac] Well, the way I figure it, we can't give them a chance to do anything with her. - [Tom] We? What about your gold? - [Isaac] Well, one ain't separate from the other. We'll get them both, or none. Now don't get me wrong, Tom, that gold means a lot more to me than you know. (wind whistles) It's gonna take a whole lot of doing getting in there. They can see us coming from just about every direction. I think we're gonna have to move around and get a closer look, see what we're up against. - Then he screamed! (laughs) Then he goes to the ground like this (wheezes). - He was dying. And then McClain went, boom. And it was all over. Orlando, Miguel, Juan, Potest. Oh, it was a devil's ride. - The devil doesn't have the gold. We do. And the men that killed our friends, they'll be back. - This is good, we're safe here. Let's have us a little look see. - Didn't we see them back at the mine? - Yep. And they couldn't have showed up here at a better time, either. We're gonna sit right here and wait. - [Tom] For what? - My two partners down there to show us the best way in that village. - Now what a military man does before he engages the enemy is check after your equipment, make sure it's all in top shape, see? I ain't saying that I was an officer or anything. That don't mean I don't know military ways. Like this, for instance. Looky here. Here, I'm showing you something. Look. When I go like this, that means come on ahead, see, forward. - [Ned] Is that right? - Now, look, when I go like this, see, get down, that means get down low, get down on your belly. See? Now, when I, uh, well, hell, that's about all there is to it. You think you can remember them two things? - Well sure I can. This one means come on ahead. This one means get down low. - That's it. You got it? Come on, let's go, let's move it out. Ow, God. - Grover. - What? - They sure missed a good officer when they missed out on you. - Tell me about it, come on. - I think we've got visitors. Now let's go put that gold in a safe place. (soft instrumental music) - [Ned] That sure is gonna be easy pickings, isn't it? - Hey, we can get in and out of there lickety-split. - [Ned] Don't forget, you can't run too fast now. What'd you do that for? - [Grover] Ned, Ned, Ned. - Grover, what is that? - [Grover] What's what? - [Ned] This one. - Think there's enough dynamite there to wipe them all out? - Just enough to keep them clear of us. I ain't out for no killing, Tom. - [Grover] What the hell is that? Don't shoot it! - [Ned] I'm not shooting it, I'm being quiet. - Don't step on the duck. What's that? - [Ned] My match has gone out. - [Grover] Well light another one. Oh, looky here, looky here. - This here's our gold. - What a bunch of dummies, making it so easy on us. - Don't you give them too much credit. It was your military things that got us in here so good. - [Grover] Let's go. (duck quacks) (suspenseful instrumental music) - [McClain] Hold it. - Grover. - Oh, shit. (guns bang) (chuckling) - Jesus. There are your devils. (lively instrumental music) - Devils are gone, I feel rich and free. - [McClain] Then maybe the time has come. - The time has come for what (speaks foreign language)? - To go home. - Home? (laughing) If only that could be. In our village, they wait for Jesus to come so they can hang him from the city hall. - Right along side of Lupe, huh? (laughing) - Come on, gold will buy anything. Buy your freedom. - Well, perhaps. What are you going to do (speaks foreign language)? - I guess I'll go home. - You guess. (lively instrumental music) He guesses. (laughing) - You are making fun with your friend, eh? (lively instrumental music) - [Carmella] You don't leave me here with your (speaks foreign language)! - [Jesus] What is this madness? This should be a celebration! To the gold! - [Crowd] To the gold! - [McClain] Umberto, come on down and join the others! (grunting) - [Tom] I can't wait anymore, I've gotta find Lisa. - All right, all right, Tom. I've gotta locate her first. You wanna help me? - Yeah. - You go up behind those rocks and you keep a lookout. Be careful. - Okay. - [Lupe] Hey, amigo, you think Jesus is right? Those two men we killed, they were devils? - [Bandit] They bring us trouble, no? Just like the blonde girl. - [Lupe] Maybe we should kill her, too. - I almost killed you, boy! Shh. - [Lupe] You are a lucky girl. - Please, leave me alone. - [Lupe] Oh, no, I will do much more than that. - [Lucy] No! - I'm going to show you why you will pray that it's Lupe who'll buy you tomorrow. (Lucy screams) (groaning) - [Ricardo] Hurry. Come, we must run. - Where? - To the ground. - Ricardo! You will die where you stand, Ricardo. I'm gonna kill you for this. (popping) (groaning) - [Lucy] Tom! Tom, I thought you were dead. - Are you okay? - Yes. What happened to you? - Okay, now you two gotta break this up. You okay, Lisa? Can you get some horses? (Ricardo speaks foreign language) Hey, Tom, you two take Lisa outta here. There's gonna be a lot of shooting going on. - [Tom] What about you, Isaac? - Well, I still gotta get my gold. - [Tom] Maybe I can-- - Maybe your sister needs you a whole lot more than me, boy. Get on outta here. - Okay. - [Joe] Lupe's dead. Lupe's dead. - You have seen the devil in your sleep. - No, Lupe's dead. The men and the girl, they have gun. - Talk to me. - A man, this high, and of a color I've never seen before. - I knew I should've killed this man! (tense instrumental music) (booming) (tense instrumental music) - Hey! There's women and kids in here! - I don't wanna hurt nobody! - [McClain] Then what the hell do you want? - Well, I'm remembering a visit you paid to my mine. You just bring that gold on over here, and I'll be on my way. - Can we talk? - [Isaac] Just send the gold over. - It's right here. Why don't you come and get it? (booming) - He's inside the mission. (guns bang) - Hold your fire. The gold is yours! - One man only. I want it brought here, inside. - It's on the way. Jesus, the roof. Carmella, don't. - You really expect us to let you give back the gold? - Jesus. (Jesus speaks foreign language) Cover me. - I understand. Will you take it back, amigo? - You're damn right we will. (tense instrumental music) - That's real fine. Just come on in here. Slowly. - [McClain] How's this? - That's good. You just put my gold right on top of that stone. - Whatever you say. - Slowly. (tense instrumental music) Now you put your hands up real high. Now you just back on outta here. - I think you've played this game before. - Once or twice. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Now! (gun bangs) (exciting instrumental music) (gun bangs) (booming) How much more can he have? - That man is a black devil. I could not have missed him. - You just don't listen, do you, boy? - I thought you might be in trouble. - Here, take this gold. Get inside. (guns bang) Now you get going, I'll catch up to you later. - What about you? - Well, I got a little something to leave behind. - [Jesus] Senor, you are one hell of a fighting man. You have my compliments. (booming) - [Bandit] Where'd he go? - [Bandit] Let's look around, there he is. (guns bang) (booming) - [Tom] Isaac! Isaac! - Tom. - Isaac. Isaac! Please don't die, Isaac. Isaac, Isaac. Come on, get up, Isaac. Come on. Come on, Isaac, get up. - Let's get out of here, we have to go. - I can't leave him. He's my friend. - But he is dead. Let's get out of here before they kill us. - [Carmella] McClain, McClain, where are you? - [McClain] I'm over here, now shut up. - He's alive. Take my sister and get out of here. I'll meet up with you later. - But they will kill you. - Go on! Go on. (tense instrumental music) - Well, boy, I'm glad to see you're not hurt. Oh, look around you. Hasn't there been enough killing? What's your name, son? We could be friends. Come on. Hand me the gun. Come on, I'll take you home. (dramatic instrumental music) (gun bangs) (lonely instrumental music) (peaceful country music)
