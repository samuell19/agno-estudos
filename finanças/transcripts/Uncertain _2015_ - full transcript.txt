(lapping waves) (whipping wind gusts) (flies buzzing) (cacophony of wildlife) - Hello? Hello? Sir? Sir? (makes monkey call) (hoots) (boat engine roars) - Hello, come out here. (triumphant laugh) (gun blasts) (grunts) (heavy breathing) (tranquil music) - Uncertain, It's not on the way to anywhere. You've either got to know where you are going or be lost to find it. Being located on the Louisiana-Texas border tends to be an area where persons with uh, criminal histories or problems with the law will tend to migrate to, to get away from other jurisdictions. In other words, people who are running from something in Louisiana would like to run into Texas and use the state line as kind of a barrier to protect themselves from being arrested in Louisiana. So uh, or running from anywhere, Uncertain's a good place to hide because as I said it's just down in the middle of nowhere. - If you live in Uncertain, you retire at 21. Which means that, once you turn 21 there's nothing for you to do out here. I mean, you are gonna be drinking at those bars religiously. If you can break out of that cycle and just fight your way out and get somewhere else, you'll be able to get your feet on the ground, and build up from there. Yay, beer! ("My Girl" by the Temptations) There's not a lot of new faces. Even if you got a job in this town, there's no women. All the girls have all moved off and got married. The ones that do come down here, better get there first, you know. - [Karaoke DJ] Zach, are you ready to sing? You gonna give me the name you wanna sing? - Umm. - [Karaoke DJ] You don't know yet? - Dunno yet. - All right, All My Loving, Oh Darling? - All My Loving. ♪ Close your eyes and I'll kiss you ♪ Tomorrow I'll miss you ♪ Remember I'll always be true ♪ Do, do, doo, do, doo (meat slicer whirring) - [Cindy] You do realize that you look like Peg Bundy with that cigarette hanging from your mouth - That's quite all right. - Aww, I've got to wash my hands. - Well, wash your hands, honey. - OK, your mama's not lookin', you want some? Good girl. Me and my girlfriend, we're both in recovery. So we figured this was a good place to kinda get away from everything. And you know, we've been able to make a life together that's just beyond anything we ever dreamed. (meat slicer whirring) (solemn music) People say, you're a little obsessed with hogs. It's being in an environment, you know, and doing things that I did prior to becoming a drug addict. And it was a re-connection with my Native American ancestry. It's something to, uh, hold on to. Early this morning, we got our first, uh, sighting, of Mr Ed. There's the profile, you see that long snout? That's him, I can pause it. Mr Ed, the hog with the horse's head. You know, that's not just any hog, you know. That's the big one out here. This is his territory now and til he either dies of old age or somebody kills him, I don't think there's another boar out here big enough to run him out. So we need to kill him, not only for the food and everything else, but once we get him out then that'll bring other animals in. (boar chomps) Oh well. (electric knife whurrs) (phone rings) - Johnson's Ranch. OK, which cabin are you wanting? How many people do you have? - How far you going down? - I'm still going, I ain't gonna go far but I'm going somewhere. - What are they catching now, yellow bellies? - On minnows or jigs? - Really? - Yellow Bass? - White Perch, huh? Now you can catch 25 with no size limit. Well, it's not hard to stay legal. You're on the straight and narrow now aren't you? - When you're young but it's gonna catch up with you. - Boy it's a nice cool morning. Well that vegetation's got a lot of the back parts of the lake swallowed up. - [Woman] I heard that it, the whole way it started was that it was a plant that people bought for their fish tanks. And when they threw it out, it ended up, you know, working its way to the lake. - Always risky business, playing with Mother Nature. No, it's put us on a limited lifetime I think. - Yeah, cause if the lake turns into a, island per se, there ain't nothing to do. There's no reason for people to come. I mean, they waited until it was so bad and then they really sprayed it but it just killed what you see. It's not, and then it sinks. And then it takes up the bottom of the lake. So I don't know. - Well. This is Mother Nature's favorite place. Heaven and home, and a little bit of hell too. It's heartbreaking to know the only place like this is going away if they don't figure out something, and I don't see a solution. It's already affecting the fishing big time. It's just getting worse. There's no oxygen so there's no fish. I see the beginning of the end with this stuff. The raccoon came to us in a kid's hand. (heartwarming music) Oh, he was a couple inches long. Two weeks after we got him he opened his eyes, raised all our dogs, he's a wonderful part of our lives. He's not a pet, he lives outside every day, comes in at night and plays with the dogs and eats his groceries at the end of my bed. And I play with him a little bit and then he goes his way, right before the sun comes up. (heartwarming music) - The thing about Texas is it allows convicted felons to hunt, with rifles that are either replicas, curios or were produced before the year 1899. It would be illegal for me to own anything else. They could give me 10 years for having these rifles in Louisiana. Texas doesn't care. (loping music) You ain't got to run faster than the hog. You just got to run faster than the slowest person. (laughs) The hog is over there. (trigger clicks) God damn it, what happened? Fuck, he just ran off. God damn it. Mr. Ed, that son of a bitch. That's one lucky fucking pig. And he's smart too, he ran off when he heard that click. He'll be back. Mr. Ed is a smart pig. He knows we're hunting him up there. That's what this area here was about, was to get it where, where somewhere he doesn't expect us. So every time you make a step and you give up your hand, you've educated him. He's just a monster and he's a super aggressive animal. - [Zach] Living down here I tell myself don't dream, that's not how you're gonna be happy in life, and I kind of pushed my dreams aside. My mom raised us weird. We were just born to be weirdos. Whatever we wanted to do, we were into it. She had a meltdown. She just got depressed one night, she says she's got dynamite and she's about to end it all. I was talking with my neighbor and she was like, the best thing to do is have the police do a welfare checkup on her. So I had that done but because of that they carried her off to the hospital to see what was wrong with her. So now I live here with my cats and my 360. I'm not the big hunter or fisherman, that's all my brother. - Bear and Son, they discontinued this gentleman's Bowie. That is a fucking knife, I mean that's 125. - Zach, leave the knife alone before you hurt yourself. - Sure. A lot of people will ask me, well Zach, what are you gonna do if they ever come up with a cure? But if they did ever come up with a cure, I'm not gonna get it removed, I'm just gonna get a thin red X across there. Just so people know, I had it but now the day has come that it's cured. Just a thin red X, like that. But yeah, that's just kind of my diabetes tattoo. - I value what I have today, you know, and who I am today. And inter-personal relationships, they start to heal. As evident with, uh, you know me hunting with my son again, you know, or him even being in my employ again. You done? Isaiah, are you done? - I've uh, probably used the word dad probably only called him that like three times in my entire life. There was no father, son relationship. You know, we had threesomes with women together. Instead of teaching me how to play catch with a baseball he taught me how to cook dope. He's been to prison so many times, I think he's done about 13 years. (dramatic music) - There was a kid that owed me a bunch of money. My sister had died of a heroine overdose, uh, a few days before. And, uh, I wanted to go to her funeral which was in Utah and you know my parents, at the time, knew how strung out I was, they didn't want me there. And, uh, so I went over to this kid's house, ready to do battle, you know, strike fear in the heart of your enemy. - We shaved his head into a Mohawk and uh, I painted war paint on his face, and we took a brick hammer and tied a leather strap around it and we took a hay bailing hook and wrapped it to his hand as well, so it couldn't be yanked out. - And I pounded on his door in the middle of the night ready to attack him to get my money. - So we hear tch-tch and my father goes, you know what that is? And I'm like, yeah. (gun blasts) And he literally flew back about ten feet. - [Wayne] It was like being hit in the chest with a sledgehammer, it was like somebody taking a red hot poker and shoving it into you. - Get him in the car and I ask him, what do you wanna do? If you go to hospital the cops are gonna get involved. What do you wanna do? And he's like, take me to the hospital. - It went through my arm there, and it came out there, blew all that meat out and then I took another one in the chest. It went through my gallbladder, through my liver and into my intestines and it ran up behind my lung over here, somewhere by my heart. When I showed up he just assumed I was there to kill him, which I, you know, I can't say I was or I wasn't. But uh, you know, I would have shot me, too, you know? You know any normal human being would say, ahh man, you know, I was shot, would, that's enough, would quit doing drugs, you know? Just go ahead and cock it, and pull that primer off of it. Make sure you point it in a safe direction when you do. And stab it down there as hard as you can. And then twist it, about four twists, five, until it gets tight. There you go. If it twists, let it turn. Let it turn as it comes. Come on. - [Isaiah] It's letting go. - No it's not. The bullet's right there, the bullet's right there. - I see it. - Lift your arms. You're gonna get any of these sweat glands. When I was a kid, I was probably ten or eleven, I was sitting in my living room where I lived with my father and uh, my stepmother had a parrot and they had it in a cage on top of the piano across the room, and I was pumping shells through a shotgun because it had been jamming. And I pumped it, and that son of a bitch went off. And it come about a foot away from killing the parrot. Blew a big hole in the wall above the piano. So I hung a picture over it. They never knew until they moved. Found this big hole in the fucking wall. (fireworks whizzing and popping) (cheers) (phone rings) - Johnson's Ranch. Yeah, we're still here. If the lake dies, the town dies. Until the fish start biting people aren't gonna come down. I had some people in Lubbock calling and saying that Caddo's impassable. So then they change their vacation plans and those last minute vacations we would be having right now, aren't coming. You gotta be patient, Henry. - [Karen] Your patience running short? (engine revving) - Yeah, it is pretty peaceful here in the mornings. Just me and the weevils, you know, and the salvinia. Under lab conditions the plant can double its leaf number in three days, it can make itself into forty square miles in three months. Very hardy plant, difficult to kill. You can go out there with sprays and three months later it'll look like you were never there. The weevil has turned out to be the only actual effective bio control for salvinia. The adults feed on the buds and leaves and the larvae bore in the rhizomes. So together that really does a lot of damage. It's a big undertaking. Bio control would need to be done on a scale which has not been done before. A lot of people just simply don't like the idea, or the expense or whatnot, but the question is what are the options? It's gonna take pretty much everybody, and it's gonna take some unity and uh, we're all in the same boat. The lake and the town of Uncertain, which pretty much relies on the lake, you know, is relying on the weevils. (gun blasts) - He's down. That motherfucker's down. There's so much smoke I can't see shit right now. Recoil caught me in the head. Yeah, he's down there. Lets get that fucking hog. I don't see a spot of blood, which is pretty unusual. I don't see any blood. I think we're walking around in circles now. No other hog could be that goddamn lucky, you know. You know, Molly is a, is a better chance of finding it than anything you know. She's hunted down a couple of dead hogs already. So she knows what the game is. Where's that pig at, Molly, where's that pig? I'm sure he hit the ground last night. But it wouldn't be the first time that I've shot one and they've showed back up with bullets in 'em. He's got nine lives, he's hard to kill. ♪ Let me lick you up ♪ Let me lick you down ♪ Turn around babe ♪ Let me lick you all around ♪ Oh, let me lick you girl ♪ Like your lover should - [Preacher] Good Morning.

Well, second day of sobriety. Kudos to me on, well, not really it's only two days. Fuckin', I'll go two days when I'm just too poor to buy a beer. All my money went to booze and none of it went to paying off the people I owed. And, it's got to the point, my phone is shut off cause I can't afford to pay that cause the work's been so slow. My, haven't had Netflix in forever. Um, haven't been able to pay off Medtronics which I really need to 'cause they're gonna shut me off and stop, you know, sending me supplies. Fuck, I'm just gonna sit around here, fuckin' whack off, eat beans, and yeah, play Minecraft. You think you got drinking under control, and then drinking gets the best of you.

I mean, at first he had a giddy in his step and he seemed really good and then all of sudden when he was maxed out with borrowing from people and everybody started cutting him off, he just went downhill quick. I think it is a lot of stress running up there. The stress of needing money. I need money, I need money." And I think when he's down here he don't have all that stress. I try to enforce that by telling him he needs to come and check on me. He needs to come you know, I need you down here helping me in the morning. And until she came in, he did, every morning. He has breakfast and coffee with me and usually he'll hang out down here at the dock and talk with me and stuff, and it stays that way for a while. - I don't have any idea. I, I don't know. And I ask him, is it because her first name is Mary? He was like, no, no. I said, cause I know she don't hold a candle to my mama. And I said she don't care anything about you. Yes she do, she just don't show it. I said, she don't care a thing about you, nothing. And she don't mind telling nobody, you either, that she don't give a damn about him. And she told my sister, yeah as long as he, as long as he got some money I'm gonna take it. I'm goin' to get it. He got it, I'm gonna get it. You know so, I don't know. - I got some, uh, some great intel on that hog last night. He's been there the last two nights. As much as I hate to say it, I've been outsmarted by this hog many times. He tracked me out of the woods last time I walked out of here. So he is letting me know that he knows that I'm here, and this is his territory. To get above that scent, we needed to bring the tower on up. I've kind of got to know this guy, man. And I'll tell you what, he has no enemies in these woods except for me. You know, and he knows that. So like, then you kill your adversary then what do you do? (low warbling) - [Voiceover] What was that noise? - Alien abduction, I don't fuckin' know. That was kind of strange a noise, man. It sounded almost mechanical. - [Isaiah] Oh hell. - What the fuck is that? - We don't know, it's a UFO. - Damn. You've said you've seen some weird things, though. - I have seen some really weird stuff out in those woods. That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. - What's this flashing light here? - That's a tower back in the distance. - That's just a reflection. - That ain't a reflection, Charlie. There's nothing out there for it to reflect on. A series of lights just descending out of the sky. Hovering around. - It's like, shoot at it or something? I don't know, you might not want to shoot at it, huh? - Have a good look at it with the scope. - Yeah, I guess so but I have no idea what the hell that was. There's no explanation for it. Except uh, I haven't seen the hog since that thing showed up so, - Maybe they took it with them? - That's what I think, - They make their own cochon de lait. - Yeah they, (laughing) they took my pig. And I'm wondering if it might not been even invisible to the naked eye. That the only thing that picked it up was the infra-red beam, you know? I mean that's real possible. Come on, come on. We need hog pictures. Frogs. Probably see a raccoon party here pretty soon. (majestic music) - [Woman] We need to have some kind of plan of action. We need to put this much money towards spraying, put this much money towards weevils. We need to get the state of Texas onboard so we can make things move. - Now, we would all like it to just, go away, OK. It's not happening. - From the larvae to uh, ready to eat, ready to do their job, what kind of time period are we looking at on the weevils? - Larvae to adult stage is six weeks. So, when they lay eggs and their offspring start laying eggs, the numbers can go up really quickly. The weevils are, they're two millimeters to three and a half millimeters. I would say that we probably need a billion and a half. To actually take care of this problem, now I'm just winging it you know, that it would probably take a couple of million dollars. - That's what I'm doing is getting the fuck out of Uncertain. That's the grand plan, cause it's just too much. Your brain explodes and you're upset and you're screaming and hollering and, yeah, that's why I say I had to get out of this town. Sometimes shit feels hopeless but you gotta remember to remind yourself, it's only hopeless if you're not trying. You know the theists will tell you, you know you're strong when you, uh, put all your problems in the Lord's hand, or Lord's Hands, and then in the same breath they tell you, um, what is it? The lord acts through you. So what you're saying is, just have faith in yourself and you can get shit done. You know, no but you need to ask God for his help. He says he's not gonna help you in the Bible, what the fuck are you talking about? I wanna see if I can get that waffle maker to go with me as well, to Austin. Cause, that fucking waffle maker's legit. And it don't take a lot to make waffles. You can throw everything in there. Frickin' bacon, you can make brownies out of a waffle maker. Oh, is it gonna work? I just know it's gonna be epic. It's not, it's just gonna be a total change. That'll keep the insulin cool. - The day that they integrated, a lot of the people here, the black families, they got upset with him because he sent us to school. And he told them, he said, I'm sending my kids to school to learn I'm not caring about all this other stuff. They need, they gonna learn. (dramatic music) (thunder booms) (dramatic music) - [Clerk] What's the name again? - Zach Warren. I'm a little nervous, cause I know something's gonna go wrong, I just know it. But I'm also glad, just feels good to say that I'm gettin' out of here, I'm making a change that's gonna help me in the long run. (wistful music) All right. Jesus Christ on a stick. What's up man? (grunting) Yeah, this one? I forgot which one. I thought it was that one down there. (dog barks) How's it goin'? Oh. Carlos, he's deaf. And then I have not caught the other guys' names. They're all also deaf and they have a lot of deaf friends. You know it's kind of hitting me all of a sudden, well you're in Austin. And it's that do or die kind of thing. Awesome, if you know my application online gets mixed in, it's Zach Warren. I mean, in case, you know. - Zach Warren. - And I just want to say, I do have like lawn care experience, a lot of it actually. - OK. - [Zack] So, working in the hot Texas sun does not bother me. - All right. - It's gonna have to be by the end of the week or by the start of next week to have a job. I spent my $100. I got beans and I got spam, and I can make that last. Insulin supplies' good.
