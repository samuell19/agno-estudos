Did you know that a hippopotamus' sweat is red? Can you imagine that? Arm, please. Arm. Thank you. I've got another good one for you. You're gonna love this one. Cats do not meow at each other. Only humans. Now wouldn't you love to know what that's all about? Okay, other arm. Thank you. I don't know, maybe I made that one up. - Uh-uh-uh. - There you go. I love you. Goodbye. Hello, my young friend. Little Miss Muffet. Where you been hiding yourself? Got a lot of pups for you today. - Ah... - Ten dogs. New National Geographic. Goldmine. There's a Great Dane, and a golden retriever, and a Doberman Pinscher. Have a lovely day. Say hello to Grandmother, huh? Hmm, seven is the only number from one to ten that has two syllables. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's right. Interesting. Hey. Hello, Music. I'll be up to fix your air conditioner in a couple of minutes. All right? Up you go. Okay, yeah. Thanks, Felix. Got it covered from here. All right, Millie... Okay. Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Millie? It's all right. It's okay. She's just sleeping. It's okay. Uh... All right. My neighbor's... My neighbor's just passed out on the floor. She's not... She's not breathing. I can't feel her pulse. I think she's... So I just have a couple more questions for you. Sure. Does she have any other family members that we can contact? Family members? Meeting's over, hon. Mm... Oh, I must have dozed off. Everybody was just talking and talking, and the next thing I knew I am dreaming. Oh, of a beautiful, beautiful paradise. Far away from here. Come on, honey. Here we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going, hold on. Uh, one last thing. Nudge from the judge. Sign that. It's vibrating. It's a little distracting. Oh, shit. Jeez... George. Georgie. What? Yeah. My grandma died. Yeah, that's... That's pretty sad. Um, let me call you right back. Let me... Let me call you back. Did your grandmother really just die? Yeah, it's fine. I don't really know her very well. Hey, do I have to do something to get one of those or can I just... - Buy one? - You earn these. I have to earn it. Yeah, that's true. That's how you do it. I feel like that's kind of what I'm doing here. On a quest for a Radgical? Wanna come along with me? Sure you do. What could be better than this? - Wanna give it a spin? - Ah. Darn right you do. Say it with me. One, two, three, Radgical. Knock-knock. Surprise! Hey, George. Music. Hey! It's been a while. Nothing's really changed, huh, George? Your grandmother left these papers in case of emergency. Don't know what's in 'em. Rent's paid for 30 days. She didn't happen to mention a will, did she, George? Oh, jeez. George, what did I ever do to you? Well, for starters, you broke into my apartment. Here we go. I made a mistake. I thought it was my grandma's. Then you tried to steal my television set. I did steal your television set, and I'm... I'm really sorry about that. And then you fell off my fire escape. Okay, First of all, I was drunk. And high. Really high. And second, I just wish you weren't still mad about that. It was years ago. That was five months ago. Hey, I'm serving the time. Look, you're gonna like this. I'm one of you now. Hmm. Besides, my brief stay with the state was an eye-opener for me. I am motivated now. I'm a better person now. - And I've got a plan. - Hmm. Paradise. I've got a plan, too. I'm going home. Been a rough day. If Music needs anything, you know, I'm right down the hall. Third fire escape to the left. Ah-mm. Well, you know what I like to do when there's nothing else to do for the day? - Hey, hey. - I like to sing a song... Can you hear me? Yeah, that's right. Music? It's me, Zu. ♪ They're Radgical They're Radgicals... I'm... Oh, would you look at that? I'm your sister. Well, I'm your half-sister, technically. Zu. When was the last time I saw you, Music? - Maybe it was, like... - Go to bed. See you next time, everybody. I will go to bed. Good luck on your mission. Whatever it is. Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. Listen, do you guys do pick up? Like, if I got a kid that needs to be picked up? Or do I have to come in and... And drop her off? Pick up? You mean like a laundry service? No, we don't do pick up. But... But, like, what if I wasn't here? - But you are there. - But what if I wasn't? But you are. What if I wasn't? Hello? Whoo! Hmm.

It's "make you eggs" time. Make you eggs. All right, Music, something you should know about me. I'm not a morning person. Okay. Eggs a la Zu. Bon appetit. If you don't mind, I'm going back to bed. Braid your hair. What? - What was that? - Braid your hair. I don't have hair. It's too short. So I'm not... Braid your hair! Braid your hair. Oh. - Braid your hair! Braid your hair. - Uh-huh. I know. I got it. I don't know how... Braid your hair. Braid your hair. Braid your hair. Braid your hair! Shh! I was just... Hey! It's okay. Music, it's okay! - It's... - Ouch. Shit. Calm down. Calm down!

You know me. Trust me. I'm going to crush you now, and make you feel safe. - Come on. - You're not hurting her, are you? No, I'm not. I'm crushing her with my love. She will be all right. I don't like that. I don't like that. You cannot hit yourself like that, Music. Okay? Your friend Ebo doesn't want to see you hurt yourself like that. All right? How about some chewing gum? I know where you keep it. Braid your hair. Braid your hair. All right. I think I can do that. Let's go. It's all right. Sit here. Chewing gum. As I was saying, I live next door. I'm sorry for your loss. I knew Millie very well. If there is anything I can offer... to help you in your time of need, just let me know. Can you move in? I am close by. All right, Music. Let's get you a braid. Okay. And the blue one goes on this side. I know that. Okay. Let's get the other side. Ebo? Ebo, yes. E-B-O. And you are? Really stressed out. I'm really stressed out. No, I'm Zu. - Zoo? - Zu. Kazu, but Zu, with a U. - Z-U. - Z-U. Zu. All right, Music. We are all done. Very impressive. It is nothing. Right, this way, Music. Okay. Do you know how often she's been having episodes? I've only lived here, like, ten hours, so, no. That is true. Oh, but Millie wrote a bunch of stuff down on, um... In a... In a book. And, uh... Music, I cannot imagine what you must be feeling today. Maybe that'll be helpful. Okay. So this is the book and... Her whole life's a schedule. She takes a walk each morning. - Oh. - We have it coordinated. I can go with you if you'd like, show you the route she takes. If you'd like. - Where's she... Where's she going? - Walk. Oh, thanks. I keep sweating, and you're the one who did all the work. How do you know how to calm her down? How do you do that? In Ghana, my younger brother was the same way. - Little Miss Muffet. - He liked to be held to feel safe. Where is he now? He is dead now. - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's all right. Special needs are not well understood in my country. In fact, in my village, it was considered a curse. Greenwich Village? No, not... Definitely not Greenwich Village. Aah... Are you always stoned? Are you just the smiliest person on Earth? No, I don't take drugs. Me neither, actually. But that's just 'cause I took way too many. So I'm not allowed to take them anymore. So the same, but opposite. Okay. She's allergic to bees, penicillin and nuts. Your grandma kept thorough records. Yeah, well, she wasn't much of a thrower-awayer. No bed-wetting for two years. Is that what she's keeping track of? Uh... Hmm? I wet the bed four months ago. Were you close with her? No, no. We were not close. Who's close with their grandma? I spoke to my grandmother this morning. - Of course you did. - Uh... Uh... So many phones. What do you do? What don't I do? That's the... That's the question. Right now I'm just trying to figure out how to get to paradise, so... Where is paradise? Costa Rica. Gonna get a plot of land, live by the ocean, grow my own food, teach yoga. Paradise. You teach yoga? What don't I do? What, so you do teach yoga? Well, I mean, I can stand on my head and I can... you know, play dead. Isn't that kind of what you need to know? I think it's a little more than that. Yeah, well, those who cannot do, teach. So I think I'm overqualified. How about you? How can you afford this grand palace? I teach... ...boxing to kids. Great. I'm hungry. You want to go get something to eat? And I forgot my wallet, which means you'll have to get it, and then I can do it next time. I can't right now, but, um, maybe later I can stop by and help out with Music. Oh, I was actually planning on sending her to a people pound later, but guess I'll keep her a little longer. Oh, my God. Did you think I was... I'm not serious. - I mean, I'm... Well, kind of... - Hey. - I didn't mean it like that. - I know. Gotcha. I'm getting you. There's a dark girl vibe you got going on. - See you later. - I'm not that dark. All right. You're late again. Remind me why we adopt this... All right. Let's see if we can shake some cash out of this old rat trap, huh, Music? What's behind door number one? Jesus. No. That is way too easy. Come on, Millie. Can't believe I'm related to these people. Whoop... Then again, I can totally believe we're related. Ah. See you in paradise. I love you. You... ♪ They're radical They're magical... - ♪ They're Radgical... ♪ - Music. Hey, turn this off. - Ahh... - Check this out. I remember these being so much bigger then... Here. So great. Oh, my God. Look, it's Raindrop. You remember Raindrop? Maybe you were too little. Raindrop was my dog. He had seizures, too, just like you. And then he was hit by a car. Because Mom... Mom left the door open. You remember Mom? She was a junkie. Go to bed. Big junkie. That is such a bummer. No. I remember when mi abuela died, I was a mess for, like, a year. - Mi abuela? ("My grandmother"?) - Yeah. - No, I don't mind that she's... - Just let it out. You need to let it out. You need to let it out. You need to scream. You need to say something. Tell me how you feel. - Let it out. Yes. - I don't need to scream out. No, really. I mean, I know I'm not supposed to say this out loud, but... I don't care. You're not processing it yet. - No, I can prove it. - You'll process on your own time. - I don't... - You process on your own time, okay? - I don't... - You will. Do you hear me? - You're going to process on your own time. - I don't care, Rudy. Okay. All right, thank you. - Do you feel what I'm giving you? - Yeah, I felt it. Yes... As you know, before we get started, - I'm gonna to need to see a little bit of... Right. - Oh! Ha-ha! Whoops. Whoops. This feels light. Why does this feel light? It's a little light. You know it's not supposed to be a little light. - It's a little light. - It can't be a little light! You can't say, "It's a little light." Do you have the rest in the backpack? Do you wanna give it to me now? - I'm gonna be in this apartment rent-free. - Oh. My Grandma Millie has, like, fifty years of stuff that's potentially worth something. I'm gonna get your money. - What do you say? - No. I say no. Don't... Put the pen down. I say no! I shouldn't even let you get this far... Don't dance. Don't Thriller dance! Stop it. Stop! Listen to me, okay? - Yes. - Do you understand how it works? If you don't give me what I need, then I have to do something bad. I don't wanna do something bad. Do you understand? I'm here, right? - I'm trying. I really am. - Trying? - I'm trying. - We're all trying. Oh, come on. Can I just have a hundred? Come on! - Twenty. And I'm only doing it because you make me laugh. - Boo. You know what I mean? Because I don't even want to do it, but I think it's funny. - A hundred. Please. - A hundred's hilarious. - Rudy. When have I ever let you down? - Regularly. One second ago. Do you remember this? You gave me this, and I said, "It's light," and you go, "A little light." The whole thing that just happened. Do you not remember? - Okay. - So this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna give you that twenty, you're gonna take it. If you sell it, you get twenty more. All right, hand out, palm up and close and kiss. Of course. 'Cause it's transactional. Shh! My mom is asleep and she's going through a divorce. So she's... staying with me. Did you get, uh, what I needed? Two of everything? Yeah, everything. I figure then I could mix and I can serve a sample and figure out what's gonna work. She just complains incessantly, and I'm literally reduced to when I was 14. Is your mom still alive? No. Oh, lucky you. Evelyn, can you please change this channel? I don't know how. My sister loves that show. You know, some people would say this is a gift to be able to spend time with their mom... - Oh. - ...in retirement. Wow, these are pretty. Which one is gonna make me feel, like, less hostile? Blue. - Oh. - You'll like the blue. Blue? Great. Evelyn, where is my food? I'm starving. Could you please? Yes, it's coming. I called the guy five minutes ago, remember? Lose the tone. Oh, um, my friend wants to talk to you. Oh, no, I don't think I should bring on new customers right now. - What? She's loaded. - No. No, you need to make an exception. I'm gonna give you her assistant's number. Honey, this could be your ticket to paradise. I... I already did that, sir. Unfortunately, I do not qualify for their clinical trial. Yes, but I cannot afford to stay alive at these prices. How else am I supposed to afford my... Sir, I... I need this medication. Okay. Thank you for your time. Right. And if you are happy, press this one. I am sad. Very funny, troublemaker. No, silly. If you are happy, which one? This one. - I am happy. - Very good. And if you are scared. I am scared. That is so good, Music. I press that one myself sometimes when I'm by myself. - Okay, and this goes from this side... - Hey, you guys! Yoo-hoo! You guys, come see what I got! What are you doing, sister? What do you think I'm doing? I'm celebrating. Come down here. All right, I'll admit it's not as big as it looked on the box, but who cares? We're about to have a pool party! - I am happy. - Yes. Yes. You wanna come in? Music. Do you want to put your hands in the water like this? Come on, come on. Press this for yes, this for no. No. No? No! Yes! You don't have to. But it's so refreshing. Come on, Music, come on. - Yes or no? - No. - Come on! - Very good, Music. Oh, my gosh. She knows what she wants. Hey, what's going on down there? Water is not free, you know? But we're setting it free, George. Whoo! Yes, George!

Watch these fighters, let them know what they're doing wrong. There'll be tournaments coming up next week. You ever been to a boxing match before? No, but I've been in plenty of fights. Hit this. Hit it. Okay, I'm not... Pull from your hip more. The back hip. Oh. Yeah, not bad. I can do this! I can do it. I can do it. Do you have to, like, hate the person when you're fighting them? You don't have to. Depends on what motivates you. What motivated you, Mr. New York Zone Amateur Middleweight Regional Champion, 2007? The desire to prove myself. Oh. So why did you stop? It was my time. See, maybe change is a good thing for her. New routine, a little boxing, everyone loves a walk in the park. I'm not saying she doesn't want to change. I'm saying she can't change. Well, that's one thing we both have in common. For her, each change comes with a barrage of new stimuli. The headphones. It's called audio filtering. Her hearing is so sensitive she can hear whispering two rooms away. What? It's true. Shut up, please. ...your sister, who could use your love and care. You won't remember this, but when she was little, she clung to you like a koala bear, like you were a tall eucalyptus tree. She can understand everything you are saying to her. Maybe not right then. How it works is she hears it... There you go. ...she files it away, and then sometimes it is returned to her main system three weeks later. There you go. You know how she looks at you and then looks away quickly? She has taken a snapshot. If she didn't look away, it would totally overwhelm her. She sees the world in a completely different way from us. Oh... Oh, God. Music. Come on, Ebo, do that thing. I'm not climbing on top of a small screaming white girl in the middle of this park. - It's your turn. - My turn? You can do this. I'll talk you through it. - Go ahead. - I can't. Okay, Music, it's okay. Ouch! She's hitting me. She doesn't know who she is hitting. Okay, stop, stop. Hold her tight. Squeeze her like a bear. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Shh. - Hold her. - It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. - Tell her she's safe. - It's okay, you're safe. - You have to tell her like you believe it. - I don't believe it. Ugh! I can't do this! Music. Okay. It's okay, it's okay. Okay, you're safe. You're safe, you're with me. You're okay. It's your sister. It's all right. Thank you. You're fine? Better? Should we get a snow cone? We'll get a snow cone. Rainbow. You got it? I think it's good you are here with her. It's good for her, you two being so close in age. You think I'm close to her age? Uh, emotionally. - That's good. Oh! - Emotionally, you are very close in age. You are, mm, nine, eight... - I am twice her age. - Okay. My mistake. What? What's so funny? - What? - You act like a child. That's nice of you. Is that a compliment? Are you complimenting me? Maybe. What is that? Oh, it's Raindrop. My spirit animal. Okay. How long do you think you and Raindrop will stay? Here? I don't know. As long as it takes to tie up some loose ends and then I need to get my ticket to paradise. What about you? Me? I'm quite comfortable here. Look, don't give me that. I think you're sad. What is this? Not again, eh? Perfect timing. - The whole block is dark again. - Saved by the blackout. - Does Millie have a lantern? - Lantern? What am I, a headless horseman? Well, look at that. A lantern, smart-ass. Okay. All right. Are you gonna tell me your sad story or am I gonna have to guess? All right. My wife, ex-wife, left me for my brother. That's it? That's it for now. I'll tell you the rest another time. What about you? My turn. See that scar? You know how I got it? Falling off the fire escape. George told me. Oh, George. Right. Maybe George doesn't know the entire story. Maybe my plan the entire time was to climb up there and jump off. And maybe on my way up, I just... I just couldn't do it. So... Thank you for having me. I should be leaving. Oh, don't go.

Like, I do not know these people, but apparently, they're loaded, and I'd really like to keep them as clients. So can we get it out now? - Just, like, if you can try to get it out now... - Uh... Okay. All right. Yes, no problem. She will call you right back. - Excuse me. Hi. - Delivery? Uh, yes. I'm actually a friend of Evelyn's. Oh. Oh, Music. Music. Music, come sit down. Just sit right there. Sorry. - Uh... - Okay, so... What are you looking for? We're looking for Percocet, morphine, Dilaudid and Oxycontin. I have some of those, but I don't have all of them. Actually, that's really expensive art. - Oh. Oh, yes. Sorry. - It's not... Don't hold on. Yeah. No, she's fine. She's fine. We got it. We got it. Let's just... Let's just... Okay. Sorry. That's, like, fake hair. Sit down now. All right, we're almost out of here. All right. How much do you need? Because I have only... Is that a Sia wig? Sia? No. - Is she here? - No. Who's that? Drug dealer? - I... - Drug dealer, is that you? Are you the drug dealer? Yes. Hi. Can I be of service? - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - I, uh... She's the drug dealer. Yeah, she's the drug dealer. Evelyn says you're, uh, an angel of drugs. Yeah. And you're having a party? No. Oh, no. Those days are... Whoop! Um, we're doing charity now. That's right. You know what we're gonna do with the drugs we buy from you? We're gonna send them to Haiti 'cause there's been an earthquake. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. All these buildings fell down and children's bones were dislocated and... It's really sad. Yeah. Now they're trying to put them back together, and they've only got Tylenol. There's all this red tape, even the Red Cross can't get in. And that's where you come in. I'm gonna buy a shitload of pain meds and put them on my private plane. Charity. Yep. It's a good day for a drug dealer, isn't it? So whatever you can get before tomorrow, we'll buy. - All right? - Really? - Yep. - Okay. Popstars Without Borders.

And I know I'm not supposed to say this, that I'm never not gonna be sober, but I'll never not be sober again. I almost gave Music away to strangers today. Almost left her. I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna stay and I'm going to help her just like she helps me because I love her. And I think that's what you do when you love someone. And I'm actually learning how to love someone. Me, too. So...
