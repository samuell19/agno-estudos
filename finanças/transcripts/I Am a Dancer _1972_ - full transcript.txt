[NARRATOR WITH MASCULINE VOICE] Whatever else, the face is familiar from a million photographs. All over the world, even if you've never seen him dance, you know the name: Rudolf Nureyev. [INSTRUCTOR CLAPS AND HUMS MUSIC] [CLAPS AND HUMS MUSIC] [CLAPS AND HUMS FASTER] [HUMS MUSIC MORE SLOWLY] [INSTRUCTOR] Preparation. [INSTRUCTOR] One... [INSTRUCTOR] Seconde. [HUMS MUSIC] [INSTRUCTOR] À la seconde. [INSTRUCTOR] À la seconde. [INSTRUCTOR] And fifth. [INSTRUCTOR] Then we plié. [INSTRUCTOR] And we display, and open, bring down. [NARRATOR] It's quite difficult to dance, you know. It needs commitment and passion. That's what helps to make Nureyev so special a dancer. He's totally committed with a fantastic passion for his work. He once said: "Every time you dance, what you do must be sprayed with your blood." That's a metaphorical way of speaking, but it says a lot about him. [INSTRUCTOR CLAPS AND HUMS MUSIC] He was talking about when you dance on stage. That, before you ever get on stage as a dancer, there is this routine of training. Day after day. Week in, week out. Year in, year out. It never stops. It never stops, this need to keep practicing all the time. [INSTRUCTOR HUMS MUSIC] Again, he was once quoted as saying: "After three days off, my back, my legs, even my spine begin to deteriorate." "After a week, my legs would shake at the barre." "I'd faint." [INSTRUCTOR HUMS MUSIC] [INSTRUCTOR] Passé. [HUMS MUSIC] [INSTRUCTOR] À la seconde. [CLICKS FINGERS AND HUMS MUSIC] [INSTRUCTOR] And passé. [HUMS MUSIC] [INSTRUCTOR] Arabesque. [HUMS MUSIC] [INSTRUCTOR] Stretch. [INSTRUCTOR] Rond de jambe. [HUMS MUSIC] [INSTRUCTOR] Back, attitude. [HUMS MUSIC] [NARRATOR] Does it look easy? That's deceptive. The muscles must be made to work exactly the way you want them to work. The repetition, the little movements, gradually build up control over your body and make it possible to do the big, difficult things on stage. Just like an athlete, a dancer gradually stretches himself to the limit of his capacity. And then tries to go further. - [PIANO MUSIC BEGINS] - Balance, control, strength. That's what it's all about. That's what the training is for. Without them, the dancer can do nothing. [PIANO MUSIC GROWS LOUDER] - [PIANO MUSIC GROWS QUIETER] - [INSTRUCTOR] Two and three. [INSTRUCTOR] And one, two, three. [INSTRUCTOR] And side. And pas de bourrée, and three. [INSTRUCTOR] One, plié. [INSTRUCTOR] And fifth. [INSTRUCTOR] One, and two. [INSTRUCTOR] Side. [PIANO MUSIC GROWS LOUDER] And one, plié. Pas de bourrée. One, and back, and bam. Excellent for the left side. For the right side, go back. [PIANO MUSIC ENDS] Follow the right side. Plié to the back... À la seconde. To the back, good. - [PIANO MUSIC BEINGS] - Right, and back. [NARRATOR] After class, rehearsal. In this instance, the famous old ballet, La Sylphide, dating from the 1830s. It's been handed down ever since, from one generation of dancers to another. Even the traditional mime gestures, like this. [MUSIC GROWS LOUDER] Nureyev, himself the producer of many ballets and a perfectionist in whatever he does, knows the importance of getting every detail right. [FINGERS CLICK TO COUNT BEATS OF MUSIC] Nowadays, even in his busy life, he makes time to create new dances. And also to pass on to others some of the traditions he has learned.

[NARRATOR] In La Sylphide, the vision of a sylph, a beautiful spirit of the air appears on his wedding day to a young Scottish farmer. He falls in love with her immediately, leaves his bride and his family and follows it to the woods where other spirits like her are dancing. But their enchanted scene together is destined to be brief and, at the end of the ballet, he will be left alone and disillusioned. Nureyev and Carla Fracci are dancing the love scene in the woods.

In a theatre dressing room. They're much alike all over the world. Somewhere to hang your clothes, somewhere to sit. A mirror to make up for the stage. No trimmings. No glamour. A dancer like Nureyev is accustomed to finding himself in strange dressing rooms. Perhaps it stems from the fact his family were Tartars: a race famous over the centuries as warriors and nomads. He was even born travelling, in a train. And sometimes it seems he has never stopped travelling. First to Leningrad, where he learnt to dance and, since then, all over the world. Wherever there is an audience waiting to see him perform. He has to dance all the time. He likes to dance all the time. HE SAYS: "I dance best when I'm tired." "Then, if I'm on my second wind, I know it will work." "My muscles will just go my way." The clothes a dancer wears to rehearse in are not meant to be glamorous. What matters is they keep your muscles warm. Nureyev is very much engrossed in the Classical Ballet, ballets like La Sylphide or The Sleeping Beauty. After all, he was trained at the Kirov, the world's greatest classical school. These classical ballets are valuable for their own sake and as a point of departure for dancers and choreographers to move forward. And, as a dancer, Nureyev wants to be seen in modern works as well. Glen Tetley, the American choreographer, created the ballet Field Figures, a very original modern work to music by the avant-garde composer, Stockhausen. And he personally taught Nureyev the leading role in it. Tetley explains he's fascinated by the carefully judged distances we all unconsciously permit between ourselves and other people and the instinctive guarding of territory about us that is part of our animal heritage. In Field Figures, he used that idea as the starting point for movement that explores the transitions between movements rather than the fixed, brilliant positions usual in Classical Ballet. He'd often say in rehearsal: "Do you know those steps in between your arabesque, jeté, pirouette?" "Well, try to make them look as though they were not between." Another unusual feature of Field Figures is that Tetley wanted the dancers not to see each other's movements, but rather to hear them and react or not. This makes an unusual and fascinating relationship. Whereas, in Classical Ballet, dancers are seldom allowed total physical involvement, Field Figures starts like this rehearsal with Deanne Bergsma with the protagonists as intimately involved as possible.

[NARRATOR] Every modern choreographer has his own approach and his own way of using his dancers. Tetley's idea in Field Figures was to explore certain kinds of movement. To see and use a visible break. To realise balance is a constant state rather than a heart-stopping verticality. And, above all, to emphasise continuity. [LOW RUMBLING MUSIC BEGINS] [MUSIC GROWS LOUDER] [MUSIC BECOMES LOUDER AND HIGHER] [A LOW RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER] [MUSIC BECOMES HIGHER] [MUSIC GROWS LOUDER AND INTENSIFIES] [VIBRATING MUSIC BEGINS] [MUSIC BECOMES HIGHER] [MUSIC CONTINUES AND FADES OUT] It takes time for dancers and audiences to accept other forms of movement and a different kind of music. It had to be studied from the beginning, like going back to school. Nureyev said that what was wonderful for him was the actual experience of working directly with Tetley.

Bird, snake, monkey. Positions of display and submission. Patterns of defining boundaries. He wanted the movement to grow organically within the arbitrarily chosen context and to develop its own relationships and tensions as it did so.

I had the baggage of knowledge but, how to operate with it, I learned in England. And I spent most of my dancing years in England. So it means a lot to me. But to say, like, London is my home or France or Paris or Italy or Milan. Or Vienna, I can't say that. I live in suitcases. And my only ground is my work, at the moment. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC BEGINS] Well, it was my very greatest fortune to meet Margot. I invited him to make his first appearance in England at this charity matinee. It was a very exciting moment. [MARGOT] At the time, Rudolf was very anxious that I should dance with him. I hadn't met him at all and all the negotiations went on by telephone. But I thought: "Well, I've never seen this boy." "He's half my age and why should he insist that I dance with him at this matinee?" Somehow I didn't dance with him at that performance but, at his next appearance in England, I did do Giselle with him and ever since then. We've danced together a great deal. I'm very happy that I finally did accept to dance with him because I've gained a lot from it. Well, I think it's complex and very simple. And always interesting. Often he's very amusing and to say that one was never going to be bored with him. He has a lot of changes of mood. Sometimes they're bad but they're not very serious. He doesn't mean them. He means it at the time but, in five minutes, it's gone. So his character perhaps superficially might appear to have bad sides, but most of them I don't think are important. [PIANO MUSIC BEGINS] [NARRATOR] Margot Fonteyn and Nureyev are rehearsing Marguerite and Armand, a ballet which was created for them by Sir Frederick Ashton. - [MAN 1] Straight up? - [MAN 2] Yes. [MAN 1] I have a great shot of her running away, looking away. [PIANO MUSIC GROWS LOUDER] [MUSIC GROWS FASTER] I'm a very romantic character, so naturally I'm drawn to romantic heroines. And Marguerite Gautier is somebody who's always fascinated me. And I read a great deal about her. Then, quite by accident, I heard this sonata of Liszt's one day on the wireless. And I sat there and I saw the whole thing that could be contained in this music. Margot seemed to me the epitome of Marguerite Gautier. Rudolf seemed to me the epitome of Armand. Well, I guess Fred's got a very good eye for typecasting. [FRED] Well, he's a passionate human being and Armand was a passionate human being. I'm often accused that it was just merely a vehicle for two star performers AND I SAID: "What's wrong with that?" I mean, Sarah Bernhardt had many vehicles written for her and were very successful. She also was a great Dame aux Camélias. [MARGOT] I can't imagine that it could feel better to be acting or singing the role. It's marvellous to dance it. And, of course, to dance it with Rudolf. I also couldn't imagine dancing it with anybody else. I think it has to be Rudolf as Armand. It was a very, very important moment, I would say, the first ballet being choreographed for me. I didn't want it at all to be a realistic thing. I wanted it to be more... [IN FRENCH] poetical evocation. [LISZT PIANO SONATA IN B MINOR BEGINS] [NARRATOR] In the last moments of her life, Marguerite, a courtesan known as La Dame aux Camélias, dying of consumption relives, in a delirious dream, the story of her passion for Armand.

"If there's no understanding and no trust between you and your partner, he said, it hardly matters how well you dance." "But, when I dance with Fonteyn, there is one aim, one vision." "There is no tearing us apart." He's always been glad to dance with others too to match himself against another personality, other points of view. When the chance comes to try something new, he's always eager to take it. A dancer's career is a short one. He has to dance. It's no good sitting around waiting. Of course, between the new challenges, he always goes back to the Classics. They are the basis for all his other work. So much so, in fact, that he has produced his own original versions of all the great Russian classics he was brought up on. Ballets such as Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcracker, Don Quixote, Raymonda, and others. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC BEGINS] Now, in the wings, Nureyev and Lynn Seymour get ready to dance the big classical pas de deux from the last act of The Sleeping Beauty. This is the moment before any performance, of a familiar work or a new one, when the long grind of daily class and rehearsal have their justification. The hard work isn't over. The hardest part, in fact, begins when the dancer steps on stage. But now, in front of an audience, the work is transformed and can become its own reward.

When he can gradually relax from the tension, can enjoy, for a time, a private life like anyone else. But not for long. Tomorrow, the routine will start all over again. What does he say himself? "You may look cool on stage, but it has taken so much effort to prepare." "Of course there are compensations, applause and praise." "But the reward of your own satisfaction..." "That doesn't come so often." "All the same, life is one's work." "There is nothing else." "While I'm working, I'm content." [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [LOUD INDISTINCT CHATTER] "That is it, simply."
