Nick Pileggi: These cities were big enough and interesting enough to be able to justify three, four, in my day, seven newspapers. Ed Kosner: You know, the WASPs read the Herald Tribune and theWorld-Telegram. The Jews read thePost and theTimes. And the Irish and Italians read theJournal-American, and theDaily News, and theMirror. And there was the number one columnist, and, usually, it was an Irish columnist. Back in the day, I mean, you would buy the papers to see what Jimmy Breslin's saying, you know, or Pete Hamill. I mean, these guys were like superstars. They were able to connect, and that's why people saw them as the voice of true New Yorkers. Richard Wald: Both of them were people imbued with that sense that we're on the side of the little guy. And the way to be on the side of the little guy was personal stories. Tom Brokaw: They had their own kind of street poetry. They always brought a blue-collars sensibility to whatever they did, but they could also explain about what was happening in the underclass. Jonathan Alter: Sometimes they were colleagues at the same paper, sometimes they were rivals, but they were always good friends. Pete, he had almost no enemies. Jimmy had more than a few. Man: How do you define your enemies? Everybody that doesn't like me, and that's an awful lot of people, that's an all-inclusive topic. Michael Daly: He loved being Jimmy Breslin. It's infectious to be around somebody who really loves being who they are. -(laughing) -I went to John Adams High School, and I wasn't a dropout. I went the full five years. (laughter, applause) -Man: The New York Times said that you wrote literature. -Yes. -That this is literature. -That was the worst thing -that could've happened to me, too. -(laughter) There's something the matter, I don't know. There's something very much the matter with the thing. It doesn't work. Tom Wolfe: He looked like you'd taken a ball of clay, and then you'd gotten another ball of clay for the head, and these arms were stuck on. What color were the four kids who got shot? -Host: Black. -What color was the gunman? -White. -Thank you. So what are you saying, this was a racial murder, is that what you're saying? No, it was over geraniums. Lemme call you back in a little while. Okay, bye. Breslin. Charlie Carillo: Pete went for the heart without being sentimental. Pete had a high school education. Everything he learned, he learned on the streets. You would come in the subway home at night, and there was an aroma of perspiration in the place, a salty kind of smell in the subways because working men were on their way home.

Newsman: Goetz wounded four teenagers whom he said surrounded him on the subway and asked for money. Newsman 2: Police say the teenagers had arrest records and three were carrying long screwdrivers. It is not clear exactly what the kids intended. Newsman 3: Many New Yorkers consider him a hero, and fundraising efforts are underway to pay his bail and legal expenses. If I were in his place and I had a gun, I would do exactly the same thing. I have no pity on criminals, you know. If they're gonna rip off people, they get what they deserve. Les Payne: This was the most terrifying period that I have experienced in New York. The city had rose up almost as one, and said that yes, he should have shot them. You know, it served them right. Alfonse D'Amato: I've been on that subway when these young thugs come in there. And they don't even have to approach you. When three or four or five come in, and they start their messing around, they are menacing by their presence. Payne: It was that vacuum that happens when journalism is not doing its job. Journalism was out to lunch, save Breslin. Breslin: They burned down something irreplaceable in New York this week, and there were people who looked at the ashes and termed them beautiful. A man on a subway took out a gun and shot four people-- two in the back-- and ran away. One of the two shot in the back was 19 and he will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. There were people who praised the gunman. As lawlessness was applauded, we in New York arrived at the sourest of all moments: when people become what they hate. Would the gunman have fired, and would people now be jubilant if the four had been white? Almost no one wants to hear that question because it would shorten the celebration. Mr. Breslin, if somebody were to attack you, would you just stand there with your arms out and not protect yourself? I hope I'd fight back, and I also hope I wouldn't shoot two people in the back and another one in the side, because he didn't turn around quick enough that I could shoot him in the back! Once my father found out from one of his friends in the NYPD that the kids were shot in the back, that's when my father said game over. How can you be threatened when they have their back to you? I can understand how he cracked, and I think the people who-- Breslin: Do you know what he did? Did you know that he bent down and he shot a kid on the floor with the fifth bullet because he had one left and he said lemme get rid of it? Behind this lunatic gunman, you had New York City. We in America, the victims, have been portrayed to be the wimps. Give your money over, wave the white flag, roll over and hope that these guys are gonna spare your life. Jimmy Breslin was the only voice out there. Mr. Breslin, sir, you do appear to be whistling a very lonely tune. -No. (scoffs) -(laughter) (applause) Donahue: This is not to say that you are wrong. -How can I be wrong? -Your speeches are not playing in New York City. I don't care! It's the law! It's in a book! Go look it up in the book! You're not supposed to shoot four people! Payne: It began to become obvious that this guy was not this fair-haired hero, the Death Wish Gunman that everyone said that he was. If I had more bullets, I would've shot them all again and again. Payne: And this is why Breslin, people who stand head and shoulders above the mob in this craft of journalism, they're so important. They realize that, yes, crime is rampant. But if your son is one of those four kids, should he be shot in the back by Bernhard Goetz because crime is rampant?

And then we'd go down two blocks from there to Liberty Avenue, there was a bar. By the time I'm 17, two guys came in with guns and held the joint up. Hamill: Oh, in my neighborhood, there was a bar on every corner except the one with the movie house. A lot of them had been speakeasies during Prohibition. Most of them were populated by men. They lived across the street from the bar. Their favorite bar was the closest one. That was it, the bar. Everybody was in the bar. Every-freaking-body.

There was another click, and her weeping rose almost to a shriek, and I saw that she had a pistol at her left temple. She was gonna shoot herself.

People are sitting at their computers, and they're sending messages to people six feet away. Man: Boy! Take that over there. Breslin: I was 16, just 16. It was tough making a living for being that young in that business. Eighteen dollars a week was a huge amount of money from the newspaper. Eighteen dollars and ten cents, that I remember. That's one fact outta the whole life that I remember. I mean, in the early, gritty days of journalism, you didn't have an Ivy League degree, and you never made a particularly good salary. You were much more naturally of the street than you were when the whole thing became a profession. These journalists today go to best-- the elite colleges. We went to the not-elite colleges. Hamill didn't even go to any college at all. I would say more than half of the guys I was a reporter with in that time had not gone to college. What happens when you have that kind of employee base? You have connections to the street. You have cops in your family. You have guys who work at sanitation. You have all that stuff.

I want people to know this is happening to human beings." Breslin: He had two good weeks in July, and then the fever returned and he was back in the hospital for half of last August. He got out again and returned to 8th Street. The date this time doesn't count. (Breslin speaking) Tell me about living with David. Duff: Well, let's see.

And Jimmy was like, "But, what if you don't drop dead? "You don't wanna do this the rest of your life. You should be writing something." And I would say, "Well, I don't know what to write." And he goes, "Like that makes a difference. "I don't know what to write most of the time. "I go outside, I find something to write about. Write something." He would hector me. He came in a difficult time, and he could have just walked away. He got everything he needed. And he didn't. Carillo: We're looking at the Manhattan Mini Storage facility in Lower Manhattan, and this used to be the New York Post. This is where I worked for many years. Right on the river, between the Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridges. Any time there was a Brooklyn Bridge jumper, everybody would rush to the window, and the photographer would put a long lens on the camera, and follow the guy. Click, click, click, click, splash! It was quite an experience for a young man. And this is where I knew Pete Hamill. (typewriter clacks) Alter: In the '90s, when newspapers were hemorrhaging cash, and often changing hands, Pete somehow managed, at different times, to be editor of both the New York Daily News and the New York Post. Avlon: Pete Hamill goes on an editor's track. He notably goes and tries to be editor-in-chief at theNew York Post, in a time of real flux, trying to turn the tide during the death of print. Kosner: Pete is a wonderful editor. And he was a wonderful manager because he's a wonderful person. Everybody loved him, and people respected him. Carillo: He'd come to you, and he'd say, "Well, you know, that lead, maybe you should try..." He would never say, "Do this!" And you'd realize, oh, he's right. He's right. I think this man knows what he's talking about, and he certainly did. I did not fire Pete Hamill. (crowd shouting angrily) Newswoman: Two days after a bankruptcy judge awarded ownership of thePost to Abe Hirschfeld, Hirschfeld held a news conference announcing Wilbert Tatum to run the paper. This is what happened when Hirschfeld told workers he didn't fire Hamill.

Hamill: More than anything else, I'm sad about the possibility that this paper is in mortal danger. Alter: In defiance of Abe Hirschfeld, the inmates, basically, took over the asylum. And with Pete barred from the building, the staff put out a paper that trashed their owner. Carillo: The opponent's weapons are money and power. Our weapons are only words and images. So, we fight with what we've got. Newsman: After Hirschfield got a court order banning Hamill from thePostbuilding, the renegade editor conferred with his reporters and editors from a diner next door. When I picked up today's paper and I saw what those guys did, laying their entire careers on the line, to put out a newspaper that was totally fearless, I had no choice. Carillo: So, Pete sat in the South Street Diner, and the layout sheets were brought down to him, so he could edit the paper, and they went back upstairs with ketchup and vinaigrette dressing on them. And it was really glory days. People got a vicarious thrill about the wild west element of theNew York Post. -(shutter clicks) -(laughter) Newsman: It was a zany scene outside bankruptcy court, as prospective New York Post publisher, Abe Hirschfeld, kissed and made up with the editor he fired last week. The slaphappy ending came after the judge worked out a compromise in which Editor-in-Chief Pete Hamill gets editorial control, and Hirschfeld has legal control of the business. Carillo: The revolution was a thrilling thing, and even though it wound up to be, sort of, in a losing cause, it was unforgettable. ♪ ♪ Newsman: The nation's oldest, continuously published newspaper, is now officially bankrupt. Newswoman: Enter thePost's former owner, Rupert Murdoch. Alter: When Murdoch demoted Pete, he quit, and that chapter was closed. Jimmy was also in the headlines around that time, but not in a way you would wanna be. Dwyer: I think Jimmy is a genius who spent a good part of his life trying to persuade people that he's not. He does this by being boorish, by being impossible, making up lists of people he's not talking to this year. And it's an act, but sometimes, as they say, the dancer becomes the dance. ♪ ♪ Newsman: Jimmy Breslin is in a heap of trouble for alleged racial slurs, and the staff of Newsday's in an uproar. Newsman 2: It all began when New YorkNewsday columnist Jimmy Breslin wrote this column last week, complaining that his wife was not spending enough time at home with him. Enter Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh, 25-year-old reporter working for the same newspaper. Yuh: It seemed off from the image of Jimmy Breslin, the columnist, that I had in my mind. And so, I sent him an email, saying that I was disappointed with his column today, and outlining my reasons why. Newsman: She sent a message to Breslin, saying the column was sexist. Breslin reportedly stormed into the newsroom, taking aim at Yuh's Korean heritage. The tirade went something like this. "I can't stand people who don't know their place. "The explicative doesn't know her place. "She's a little dog. Just a little cur, "a cur running down the street. "She's a yellow cur. Let's make it racial." Esposito: He insulted the woman. Jimmy was a big commodity, an important part of the paper, but Newsdaywas a very ethical place, and so this was taken very seriously. So, I said, well, you know, you have to write an apology. And he goes, "This is my apology. "Once again, I am wrong. JB Number One." It was like... that's it? Okay, that's the apology? It's not an apology, of course. It's an acknowledgment that he was wrong. So I write, you know, an apology for him. Yuh: He did send me a note. It wasn't quite an apology. "I'm sorry if I offended you," I believe is what he said. But, after I received that note, is when he went on the Howard Stern Show. (recording playing) ♪ ♪ Esposito: He made it worse. He dug himself in and he made it worse. So, we had a meeting. And there was a debate as to whether we would fire Jimmy. I objected. I thought that was too big a price to pay. So, they said, "Well, we'll suspend him." At which point they told me, "You do it." I was like, "Thank you very much. I'm the youngest person in the room." So, I call Jimmy up, and I say, "Look, you're suspended, two weeks." He just lets me have it. "You're just a clerk. You were always a clerk. You're no good." Patrick: I think the suspension probably killed him, 'cause I don't think he had a bigoted bone in his body. We weren't brought up to be like a lot of the other people in our neighborhood who, you know, were bigots. True bigots. Costas: Suppose I work next to you, and you're 20 years, and there's a general level of respect, and I didn't think you didn't have your fastball one day, or you missed the point and I say, "Jimmy, that column wasn't very good." -Gonna take a swing... -No, you don't come up and say, "How could you write such a thing?" "How could write such a thing about women," or something. "How could you write such a thing about men?" I do what I please, and you shut up, huh? Do me a favor.

I have to do my thing tomorrow, and I don't wanna be bothered. You know, Jimmy is an impulsive guy from the streets, and I thought, you know, he just made a huge mistake. In anger, he said a really dumb, destructive thing. Eldridge: You know, I said, how could you have done that? But he never realizes the impact of what he says on other people. He doesn't. I don't even know if he knows what he said, but he doesn't like it when other people criticize him. Esposito: It's been said of Breslin that no sleight was too small for him to elevate to a feud. That you are gifted, that you are creative, doesn't mean you're wise. Doesn't mean you're balanced. Doesn't mean you're not an insecure, sniveling little child inside who takes an insult from a rookie and turns it into a war. Like anyone who's so self-involved, that was part of who he was. Collins: He was terrible in many ways, but... his sense of sympathy was just amazing. ♪ ♪ Caldwell: From the time that I met Breslin, he had such a feel for the plight, condition of black people. Breslin wasn't afraid to go into their homes. He wasn't afraid to go into their communities. He asked me to take him a lot of places. "I want you to take me to the roughest black bar in this town."

Jimmy probably had, like, the old-school underwear. You know, just those old-school, you know, tighty-whiteys and T-shirt. Eldridge: We had to go to the hospital to have stitches in the eye. He didn't make it a big issue. Other people made it a bigger issue than he did. The thing he made a big thing of was that what stopped the crowd was some black man there recognized Jimmy, and pulled-- got everybody away from him. That was what was important to him. ♪ ♪ Costas: Did the irony of this occur to you?

That was a cop. -Interviewer: What did Jimmy say? -Fuck you. Breslin: I get down to the police station. They were standing outside. "What happened?" I says, get lost, and I got in the cab and went. I didn't even want them. I got beat up. I wouldn't even go in there. How do you like that? Now that's carrying a feud good. -You gotta gimme that, right? -(laughing) Payne: Jimmy's an Irish American. And the Irish, over time, occupied a dominant space in the New York City Police Department. Breslin: People with Irish backgrounds in the city of New York have hardly been in the forefront of the drive towards civil rights. In fact, they might have been on the other side of the fence too much and there was... I've had quarrels with them over that. Barry: He famously referred to the Irish as having those shopping center faces. In other words, the Irish had come up and struggled in a city that didn't initially welcome them, and now, we're not as receptive to others who had come up behind them.
