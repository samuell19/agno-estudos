Brother Hicri, workplace It burns and burns The wheel of fate turns, making her a star and me a doner seller. My heart burns in hot coals No feeling. Out of tune. It burns and burns Burns and bu... Something is burning. Muhteşem? What is this, son? -Doner, dad. -But it is not moving. I see that, too. I don't get why they call it that. Don't think. Just turn it. You've burnt it. Right away, dad. For God's sake, don't spring out on me, Üzerlik. Sorry, darling. There's a call for you. It is Marif. -Marif is calling? -Uh-huh. Hello. Sister Döndü, shop Oh my God. It seems really spicy. Bro... This one's a little different. It's offal. Horse meat. Forcemeat is good. That's not what I said. Not forcemeat. Horsemeat. So that's why it's cheap. A butterfly landed. What part of the horse is this made from? We take it and... Vecdi. We're going to Malatya, Vecdi. Remzi, Germany, cellphone Entschuldigung. Why is he apologizing? Don't squeeze out more than you can flush. God help me. Hello. Brother Marif. What? Nephew Bora, cellphone He's still smirking. The lush. I left Ivan off the team. I'm throwing off the grounds too. Chairman, please don't. Excuse me. -It'll kill him if he can't play. -So be it. What do I care? Sorry. Give him another chance. I'm sure he'll change. He arrived at camp with a bottle of booze. -Booze. -Sorry. Answer the phone. Dirty guy. Uncle, I'm in a meeting. Can I call you back? What? Okay, I'll be there. What happened? -We are killing grandad. -What are you saying? Son. -What's that shovel for? -We're making a pool. That's all we need, a pool. Don't waste water. It costs money. Mehmet! Who listens to me? -I'll get it, brother-in-law. -Thanks. I brought you the spiciest, best quality sujuk. A butterfly again! -It is after me since Kayseri. -It shall be a good sign. Darling, you've missed it, right? I've missed it so much. Smell the air, Nurgül. Taste the water, Nurgül. Look at the grass and trees. -Remzi? -Yes? -We're going back to Germany. -I said to look. Did I say we'd stay? -Don't yell at me, I looked. -For goodness sake. Ayşen, Gülşen. Get me some tomatoes from out back. Okay, mum. Mehmet, I said... But not... Dear. Mom? He looks like my big brother at his age. I can't stop kissing him. Auntie, then why did you never call us? I wanted to, but your mother always kept her distance. I don't mean to bad-mouth, but she's a sour woman. How nice of you. So is everyone here? No. Brother Hicri is not here. He's the only one missing. Everyone knows he doesn't want to be anywhere near you. That nutcase has come. I'll carry it, sister-in-law. Thanks, Türkan. She's always on Facebook. Can you believe her? Are you still preparing food? They are dying of hunger. If you want to, order something out. There's no need. The chicken's taking a long time. What's this? Let me take a look. No! Why is it so salty? Are three kids too much for you? Did you put alum powder in the rice? Where's Nurgül? Isn't she helping? She's pregnant, too hard. I don't want to gossip, but since they came here she hasn't touched a thing. Kader, are you using these plates? You insisted on a set of porcelain for your hope chest. Take it out. Let's use it. What are you talking about? I did it by mistake. Goodness gracious. Unbelievable. Like it's easy to prepare a meal for all these people. She expects me to order out. Our trip was so tiring. We just got unpacked, Kader. I'm sorry I couldn't help you. What do you mean? You're expecting. I'd never allow it. Thanks. I'll set the table. Let me help. Oh no! My blood pressure! It slipped. Sorry. Must be the evil eye. Never mind. My set's spoilt. That's all. The thing is... As you know, our father has been in a coma for a year and was pronounced brain dead two months ago. People normally live for 21 days, tops. But our father has lived for 60 days. Then he can live without a brain. Let's move on to the cost of keeping our father alive here at home. Kader, add up the figures as I say them. So... Bbep, 6000. Adjustable bed, 4000. Daily oxygen, monitor and such, 5000. All imported. Top of the line. Conce... Concen... Kader! -Concentrator. -That's it. The device I can't pronounce costs us 18,000. If father wasn't brain dead, he would have died from hearing these figures. It has nearly killed me. Anyway. Our weekly installments, including round-the-clock nursing, comes to 2900. The amount we paid out last year for all of this was... Kader? Minus five. How would that happen? -What did you do wrong? -I don't know. I don't get it. Never mind. I added it up before. 70,000 liras. It's a waste of money. That is, if you lack a conscience. -So? -So... We need to make a decision. Decision? About what? Well, sister... -About stopping life support. -Oh no! This guy has called us here about pulling the plug and killing dad. Is that right? Hearing that makes me see red. His heart beats two three times a minute. They pronounced him brain dead. Doctors say that. You can't silence me with that! Do you think I earn enough from the shop to pay these costs? What shall we do? Sell the shop and the poplar grove? Fine, then we'll sell Vecdi's shop in Kayseri. Supposedly your shop doesn't make money. If the Çirci Family fruit and nut shop can't turn a profit, what's with all the jewelry around your wife's neck? Hicri... It's not my place to contradict you. -But... -Kader. -Hush. -Kader. You are slandering us. Everything on me is from my wedding. Did we come here to talk about her jewelry? Marif is right. He's already dead. Pull the plug and end this. I thought you took after my brother Rıfat, that you were a dear relative. Turns out you're a vulture, Bora. The man you're trying to kill is your grandfather. The man who chased off my father. I can't stay here any longer. Everyone here is trying to bury their father before they even see him. If anyone asks, I'm in my dad's room. Unbelievable. Hicri, sit down. What are you saying? Uncle. -It's fate. Written in the stars. -My dad's dad is my grandad, right? -Enough already. -Now I feel upset. Let him go. Hicri is always being over dramatic. I counted. 42 heartbeats. He said three a minute. It's a figure of speech. Let's go talk to the doctor tomorrow and find out what's really happening. I wish you'd taken an interest in dad when he was well. That's between me and dad. He didn't show it, but he loved me best. Enough already, brother. Dad never so much as patted us on the head. Dad had a heavy hand, didn't he? You felt it when he let you. I was composing a song one day. He came into my room. "You want to be a singer?" he said. "Yes, dad" I said. "I'm going to give the family a better life" I said. "Trust me and my art" I said. What did he say? The way he beat me was a work of art. He beat me with my instrument with rhythm. -He was cruel. -Cruel. -Cruel. -Cruel. Have you got nothing good to say at his bedside? What's done is done. Shame on you, Remzi. You take after our late mother, but you act like our father. Sister. What did I say wrong? It's okay. Döndü, why are you crying? Come back, sister. He's still being theatrical. Marif. When I saw the whole family settled into their rooms... Right? If only we loved each other and stuck together as a family. That's not what I was going to say. I was thinking this place would make a great boutique hotel. Out in nature, organic. These places are selling like hot cakes. It would be incredible. Ah, dad. You love living, but this isn't life. The expense doesn't matter. It's all yours. The serum's running full throttle. Are you watering a garden or what? He's tiny. Why are you giving him so much? Nurse! Come have a look, nurse. Bora, how's it going son? I'm fine, mum. How's Ivan? He's fine. Don't worry. How are things there? Hang on a second, Bora. Look here. -Yes? -Where are you going? Out to have fun. To a party with friends. No fun for you. Straight to your room. Everyone's going. Why are you interfering? Still mouthing off. Go to your room, I said. -You're dreadful. -Get going. Mum? Who's that? Ivan? Don't let him go out. That maniac drinks too much. Do you think I'd let him? I'm a mother. Is Döndü still there? She is here. -She cries the most, right? -Yes. Whore. All she does is cry and instigate. -I'm hanging up. -Listen to this, Bora... What a thing to do! What a thing to do! You've given the house to Remzi? This is terrible. I just remodeled the kitchen, Marif. Don't half-listen and then go crazy. Good lord. Remzi and I made a deal. He'll get the house. We'll pay rent. We'll get the shop. It's the shop that makes money. Well, okay then. Give the poplar grove to Bora. Will Bora accept the poplar grove? -Bora? -Yes. Who's Bora? Bora. Who is Bora? They haven't visited in years. And they expect property. Who's Bora? Who? -Who's Bora, anyway? -My elder brother's son. What are you... Remzi. Listen. After you get the title deed, write up a rental contract with your brothers. Let's charge 500 euros rent. In fact, let's sell this house. Oh, my boyhood dumbbells. Darling, I owe my amazing body to these dumbbells. Who have I been talking to? Is anyone listening to me? I'm planning our child's future. You've got your head in the clouds. If there's money left over, I'll take you to Mecca. Vecdi, you mean kill my father and use the money to go to hajj? I'm not going to the doctor's tomorrow. I'm going to ask the hodja about the unplugging. And ask him about the inheritance. Ask if daughters get extra. Still talking about the inheritance! Vecdi, didn't my father get us the shop in Kayseri? And you still expect more? You're twisting my words, Döndü. Why did you open the window? Mosquitos will come in. Let's spray some insecticide! They'll bite us all night. -We don't have any. -You didn't bring any? Where can I find some? There must be some around. All those bags, but we didn't bring any insecticide! It must be somewhere. Hicri. Is there any insecticide? I need to spray some. There are mosquitos in the room. Have you got one? Don't yell. The kids are sleeping. -Mum! -Now she woke up too. I'll handle it, dad. A lullaby. Check the cupboard downstairs. Unbelievable! Good Lord! For God's sake. Sorry, darling. When the plug's pulled, the nut shop should be yours, as the oldest. We could put Muhteşem in charge. We can't trust him with a seed, let alone a fruit and nut shop. Why do you say that? Me and him could run it. You could run the doner shop in Mersin. Really? What a great idea! What a great attitude. You and Muhteşem stay here. I stay alone in Mersin, you say? -What's going on? -Mosquito. There's a mosquito, Hicri. Close the window from outside. So we can sleep. -What? -Nothing. Oh my God! Damn mosquito! Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Good morning, darling. What's up, cuties? Digging for gold? We're making a pool. A pool. Make it and we'll have a swim. Memo, who's that girl? Grandad's nurse. A nurse? From around here? Mum said she went out with a doctor from Istanbul. But the doctor had another girlfriend. Dirty guy. Men are all the same. I don't think so. Men aren't all the same. -They're the same! -The same! -The same? How many men do you know? -The same! Nasty girls! Grandad. What happened to you, grandad? Why do grandads always die first? -Why? -Are you okay? Sorry. I was blinded by the pain. Were you close? The first word most kids say is "mum" or "dad." Mine was "grandad." That's how much I love him. Don't get upset. I'm here. -I'm taking good care of him. -I'm so glad you are. -Forgive me. I forgot my manners. -Never mind. -I'm Bora. What's your name? -Pervin. -And your number? -Pardon me? I don't understand either, grandad. The pain is fresh. Hasn't he been this way for a year? Grandad! My darling Bora! They said you were finally visiting your grandad! You had to see him, right? You were a baby the last time you did. He fell ill and you never called. Auntie, can I have a moment? That's not true. We got together all the time. You don't know that. I adore him. Open your coal-black eyes, grandad. Coal-black? Your grandad has green eyes. I'll go and get some old photos for you. You don't know anything about him, do you? -No. -Could you please go out? Your grandad needs my attention. Go on. Speaking of going out, I mean, as you brought it up. -Would you go out with me? -He's still coming on to me. I said leave. Okay. Take it easy. HASAN ÇALIK STATE HOSPITAL Yes. I'm listening. My brother Marif tried to explain our father's medical condition to us. But we preferred you tell us. His condition is obvious. His brain is dead. There's no chance of recovery. Prepare his shroud, you say. Right, doctor? -That's not what I said. -Divvy up his estate, you say. -I didn't say that either. -Not a word out of you, doctor? I understand. We'll talk to a lawyer. The law is clear. Either you agree among yourselves or the state sells the estate, perhaps below market rate, and divides it evenly in five ways. So we have to reach agreement. We don't have to. Look at it logically. Don't be a maniac, Vecdi. The Çirci Family shop has a certain brand value. If we sell it, all those years of work were for naught. Let's have a vote. There are five of us, right? Right. If three of us reach agreement, the majority decides what to do. But let's draw up an agreement so there's no funny business. -God give me patience. -I know what to do. We're going to a notary. Article 1. The estate is to be divided in accordance with the majority decision of at least three heirs. Article 2. Everyone will be given at least one title deed. Article 3. Anyone who does not honor the contract is a scumbag. A scumbag? More like a prick. A prick? More like a pimp. A pimp? More like a son of a... Shut up. That would dishonor us all. Please write down "pimp." I've got a bad feeling about Marif and Remzi. Those two have cut a deal. No way. They wouldn't stab us in the back. Marif? That's what you think. If he hadn't ratted to dad back then, I'd have an album out by now. You'll never get that shop, Marif. The key person is Bora. You, me and Bora. If the three of us unite, you'll keep the shop in Kayseri. That's nice of you, Hicri. Thanks. It's good I thought of this first. We need to pull Bora aside and chat to him in private. How are you going to do that? Let's butter up Bora so he trusts us. We need to work Bora over. You know what we should do? Let's give Bora a ride home. Give him a back rub. That makes sense. What about Marif? Marif? He'll never think of this. By the time he thinks of it and puts his plan to work... My brother's son. Bora. Hey? Marif. Bora! You think you'll stick me with that tiny shop and keep the money for yourselves. Oh really. That's it, Hodja. What does our religion say about this? There have been religious rulings about pulling the plug. But Hodja, couldn't you do a hex or a charm to make my father recover? All right then. Write this down. Get some filo pastry. Fill it and fold it over. Then throw it into hot oil. You really write this down. Don't believe such things. Don't believe everything. Don't be deceived by superstitions. Follow the true teachings of Islam. Now go learn about true Islam. Get going. Learn about true Islam. God give me patience. Türkan, he's picking on us. I know. Let's go. My battery's running out. Let's go. Oh my God. "Şinasi Hodja. The miracle worker." I found a way to save father. Come on. Now, Bora. If you want to know how generous I am, I can tell you that I let everyone sample even my expensive cashews. Remzi, speaking of cashews, haven't you had more than enough? -It'll give you the runs. -No, I'm crazy about cashews. I also eat almonds. It balances out. -Really? -Yeah. Have some white chickpeas. They're freshly roasted. No thanks. I'm happy with these. Be happy. Bora. You don't know Hicri. He inherited a doner shop from his father-in-law, but he's come here to get whatever he can. They're always hungry for more. Always, Bora. Hungry for more. What do you think? The house should go to Remzi. And I should get the shop. You can see we never get any customers. We sell half a kilo a day. Tops. -Hello everyone. -Ah. Rıza. Marif, I'll have the usual. 20 kilos of the luxury mixed nuts. The luxury ones. And my boss said there are two weddings tomorrow. He told me to order 150 kilos for the weddings. He'll pick them up tomorrow. You got another big order. That's great, Rıza. But have we got that much in stock? Right? Get going, Rıza. Listen to you, Marif. What are you saying? If you don't have it in stock, who would? Me? Listen. I'm not saying this because he is like a brother. This guys has enough pistachios not only for Malatya, but for all of Antep. Kiss these hardworking hands. He supplies the whole area, every village and town. Do you realize the kind of shop you're in right now? Okay, Rıza. Are you done, Rıza? Shut your trap already. Get going. Enough already. -150 kilos, my boss said. -Get out of here. I'm taking a few cashews. With your blessing, I hope. He's just a boy. Can 150-200 kilos a day keep this shop afloat? Don't worry. I haven't got my eye on here. That is, if the poplar grove is worth something. Bora, my beloved nephew. Don't look down on poplars. There are some tall trees there. That grove's worth a lot. Sometimes I say to myself: "Shutter the shop and go settle in the poplar grove." That's how nice it is. If you say so, all right. We have a deal. Super. Great. Then let's get home for dinner. Come on. We'll talk about the details later. Come on, nephew. What are you doing? I'm getting a little for the road. -Really? -Yes. If dynamite was free, you'd blow up your own butt, right? That's my capital. Now get out. Go! HODJA ŞİNASİ RATES Welcome. What can I do for you? A love potion, my girl? What are you talking about? I just turned 23. Do I look like an old maid? Good God! Forgive us, Hodja. We're feeling upset these days. We're here about a brain death. We need some help. I see. And how should we kill this person? Gradually or suddenly? I suggest gradually. It's more fun. I'm not here to kill anyone. My father's brain is dead. Technically, he's already dead. Can you do anything? We'll do a brain séance. What I need from you is 12 pellets of poop from a frightened goat. -The poop of a frightened goat? -Yes. In the brain séance the frightened goat symbolizes passage to the other side and will persuade the nearly departed to remain in this world. -Dad. -What is it? Mum says I'll be in charge of the shop if we get it. -Yeah? -According to my research -the dried fruit sector is come to an end. -Really? It says here that due to climate change, crop-bearing trees will all be extinct within 100 years. -You don't say? -I decided to convert the shop into one selling plastics. If you wonder why, it's because plastic lasts in nature for 1000 years. -I found a trade with a future. -Really? Is God punishing me for giving you the holy name Muhteşem? I don't believe it. I never run out of stories. Come along. Bora, one day your dad said to me: "If eggs were good for the voice, chicken butts would be nightingales." God help him. He'd drink a raw egg every day. Having a nice chat, boys? Bora? How's my dear nephew? I'll join you for a chat. There's no need. I'll stick to myself. I'm a vulture, you know. Beware. Oh my. Remzi, come have a bite with us before the voting. Some have already had their fill of words. Just look at him. Chicken butt, we were saying. Chicken butt. Greetings, Bora. What is it, uncle? You've got a bone to pick? They promised you the poplar grove? How do you know? Have a seat, Bora. Sit down, nephew. You are a good person, Bora. You have stayed out of this squabbling among brothers. They don't call you for years as they eye your rightful share, aiming to keep it for themselves and stick you with a poplar grove worth next to nothing. And you, with your pure soul and devoted heart, agree to all they want, they who never wondered how you were and who always had you take photos so you wouldn't be in them. Look. Some will say you are an idiot. They will say, "Look how he got stuck with a poplar grove." In fact, you are the biggest fool, jerk, dope, nitwit, idiot, dunce, ugly bumpkin that ever lived, some will even say. Let them. Don't forget. Horses die standing up. Horses what? Bora. Mum, they gave me the grove. Is it okay? Bora, say, "Over my dead body. Let them take those trees and..." Got it. Bye. Kisses. Ask for the shop, Bo... Done. I'm going to a party, out to have fun. What party, Ivan? You've got practice tomorrow. Get some sleep. Good lord! Why are you looking at me? Don't bother me. -What? -Don't bother me. What are you saying? Don't bother me. Speak Turkish with me. Speak Turkish. Now that everyone is here we can have a vote. I will explain. Follow me. I will take the dried fruit and nuts shop. I'm already running it. I know all the ropes. The house I live in will be Remzi's. I'll pay him rent. Bora will get the poplar grove. He's happy about that. Döndü and Vecdi are happy with their shop in Kayseri. As for Hicri... YEŞİLYURT TAILOR SHOP ...he'll get the little shop. Any objections to the contract? Ah, Vecdi. What a surprise. Those who agree? High five. Bora, my boy? Those who agree? High five with your uncle. I don't agree. What do you mean? Are you on their side? No, I'm abstaining. But why, Bora? Why abstain? Why would you do that? My beloved nephew. You can have whatever you want. I want the fruit and nut shop. I shouldn't have encouraged you. Think it over. We'll vote again tomorrow. Bora, haven't you got a job in Istanbul? Why cause trouble? Why stick me with the poplar grove? Now listen here, Bora. I thought you wanted the grove. What happened? What did Bora say? He doesn't want the poplar grove. Why were you forcing it on him, the innocent boy you haven't seen for years? Of course he refused. You're the one who said to stick him with it. I said to... But not like that, Marif. You must have been pushy. You scared him off. Right? Let's take the boy out. To a picnic or something. Give him food and drink. We'll butter him up first. Then we can give him the little shop, Marif. A picnic, you say. Then the little shop, huh? A picnic won't be cheap. -But... -But it's a good idea. Woman, you sure are a real she-devil. -Kader? -What? -Give me a kiss. -Now? -Get off. -Just a kiss. -You beast. I'm holding a knife. -I don't care. -That tickles. -Open up. Just a kiss. Stop it, I said. Why didn't you stop, Marif? The plate has broken. The set is all gone now, Marif. It's the evil eye. Their envy of your beauty shattered the plate, my rose. -Who envies me? -The whole town. -The whole town? -Of course. -Envies me? -Why would I lie to you? -A kiss. -No. I don't want to. -Beloved Allah. -Beloved Allah. I'll put the kids to bed. I'll put the kids to bed. I'll put the kid to bed too. Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Hicri. Bora. Bora, up and at 'em. Don't be scared. It's your uncle. Get up. I've got a surprise for you. Get dressed. We're going out. Come on, son. Come on, Bora. -Are you awake? -I'm awake. Just look at him. -Uncle, what...? -Let's wrestle. What are you doing? -We are so close, you're my nephew. -My neck, uncle. Don't be scared. Get dressed. Let's go. Come on! Look at you. Up and at 'em. Bora, are you up? -I'm getting up. -What are you waiting for? Kader, I hope Üzerlik doesn't find out about the picnic. She springs out all the time. Heron. -What's a heron? -A spy plane. They appear suddenly. Just like her. She comes like this: "Hicri. Hicri. Hicri." -That's what she does. -You sound just like her. -Exactly the same. -She does this: "Hicri" -She gets stuck. "Hicri" -Stop it. -"Hicri" -I'm going to pee my pants. Stop it, Nurgül. You're just like her. Sister. How many pieces are broken? My hand... I apologize. Why apologize? We were joking around. It broke. It can happen. -Kader. -Yes? -What? -Open the window. -What? -What's taking you so long? -We're on our way. -Quick, they will see. -Okay. Stop yelling. -Don't pack a lot. What a nasty guy. -You're so lovely. -What? It's hot, I said. So hot. Here I am. -Where have you been? -I'm here. -I have been waiting two hours. -Who's counting? -Quiet. Let's go. Give me that. -Come on. Hurry. Bora, come along now. -Bora. -Come and... Come along. It's all because of you. -Oh. I planted it. -You planted it. -Is Remzi in the car? -He's there with the kids. Bora, I'm taking you to a great place. A real wower. It is Malatya's... -It's him? -Yeah. So, Marif. Off somewhere? Not really. Just a picnic. It's not nice of you to leave us here, hungry. How can you say that? I laid out food on the table. -Yes. -Bora... There's a breakfast place nearby. Why don't we go there? Come to the picnic. We'll come too. We'll come to the picnic. No, don't. You'll get tired. Marif, that's not for you to decide. -Don't come between us! -A young maid sits on the veranda. Sipping coffee as she reads a book. Wondering when she'll find true love. Perhaps the love she awaits is the handsome boy, the very handsome boy coming up to her now. The boy is at her side. He's taken a seat. And from his extraordinary lips spill these words: What's up? -Are you compatible? -Compatible, empathetic... -What do you want? -Peace of mind. That's what I had before you came. You're a typical Istanbul roughneck. -Really? -Uh-huh. So, you've gathered info about me. Let's take a look at you, who is this young lady. -What are you doing? -Hang on. I see a man. His back is turned. He's facing another woman. He's wearing something white. A smock or apron. No, something longer. A white coat of some kind. Like what a doctor wears. You're quite a fortune teller. What else do you see? A horse. There's a man on the horse. A young man and so handsome. Tall, beard stubble, a blue shirt. -And his name is... -Bora! My beloved nephew. I saved you a place up front. In front? You have a place in my heart, Bora. Come on. I'm not coming unless Pervin does. -Beat that. -You. Look at you. Look at me. Where did I forget my heart? Where is it where is it? Where'd you come from, maniac? It's sweet when Tarık Akan does it. But I'm a maniac. -I popped out too fast? -Yes. -Let me try again. -What a pain in the neck. Oh where is it? Where is she? On the ground. You're unbelievable. I tripped and fell because of you. You're getting on my nerves. Why don't you go have fun with your relatives? Go. -I won't. -Why not? I belong here with you. I don't take up much space. I'm a little thing. Tiny and sweet. Just look at you. Appealing and ugly at the same time. What are they doing here? -You're clumsy, aren't you? -And you're clingy, aren't you? I need to go walk alone in the woods if you'll let me. -Goodbye. -Don't be silly. This is a forest. You'd be asking for trouble. I already have. I really need to go, okay? Goodbye. Bora. Beloved nephew. Bora! How far have we walked? I hope he's not lost. What are you doing? I was hungry so I brought a sandwich. I'm dropping crumbs on the ground. Why? So we can find our way back. I read it in a story. May God spare us trial by child. What a pity. Nephew, where were you? My heart is racing. And I broke out in a rash. What are you doing here all alone? You dear boy? Nothing. Just standing around. Thank goodness I'm done. Young people are full of passion. Don't let us disturb you. No, no. Stay. You've misunderstood. I want into the forest to walk alone. He followed me because it's a forest. I said I wanted to be alone, but he said no. I started singing to myself. I thought I'd just squat for a moment, by myself. I wished I had a saz. I was peeing. It's normal. You're only human. Oh no! A bear! I must protest, nurse. What was in your sandwich? Honey, dad. There's more if you're hungry. Thanks to you we'll be eaten, not eating. What are we going to do? I'll handle it. Leave it to me. Don't leave it to me! Wait! I know what to do. If we play dead, it won't touch us. Keep still, everyone. That bastard. He ran away. Run! Run Muhteşem! Run away! Oh my God! My God! I'm old enough to retire. How can this be happening to me? Get rid of that bread, son. No. It's a sin to waste bread. Throw it away! Muhteşem, there's a bear on our tails! What are you doing? Throw it away! Muhteşem. What happened? Are we safe? Thank God. We're safe. Guys, are you okay? I was worried. Are you okay? I was so worried. How are... Oh my God! We're fine. You dropped your manhood. Bora, let's go. We've seen who is what. Nurse, come with us. There's room in our car. Let's go. -Muhteşem, I'm sorry I yelled at you. -It's nothing, uncle. Come along. Let's stick together. It's still dangerous. We should act as one. Act as one? I've had it! I'll try one more time, mum. Nope, it's just not happening. It doesn't scare or poop. We tried everything. I'm going. It doesn't get scared. YESILYURT TAILOR SHOP -Have a good one, Hamdi. -Thanks, Marif. Bora, say a prayer. And enter with your right foot. This place will be yours. In the heart of Yeşilyurt, right in the center, a great shop. -How much would it sell for today? -About 60,000, Bora. Marif. Marif. Where's Marif? What are you doing there? Marif. I heard you were here. I brought the rent from the shop next door. It's him again. Rıza. What rent, Rıza? Off you go. Go on, get going. What's he talking about? "What rent?" you ask. Marif, the things you say. My boss is asking, Marif. If you pull the plug on grandad Salih, God grant him a long life, and then you stick someone with this little shop, should he give the rent to you or to the guy you stick with this shop? Put that hand down. Go on, Rıza. Off you go. -Look, he won't go. -Why should I go, Marif? Give me two minutes to explain. Marif, my boss is being wronged. You know how you divided this shop in two. Well, did you know that both shops use the same electric meter? Because of that, my boss is getting really high electric bills. Marif. The shop was divided into two. That's why this has happened. Get out of here. What's done is done. Let him show the deed to the shop. Now get out of here. -But the guy you stick with the shop... -Get lost. -We need to discuss the electricity. -Get out of here. Take the rent at least. I'll take it and give it to its owner. Bora, shall we have a kebab together? Eat up, uncle. Don't divide it with me. What a joker. I divided the shop in two. So he needles me about dividing a kebab. Let him have his fun. He's right to, Hamdi. Oh, Hamdi. Rıza? Rıza. Shall we discuss this rent issue? Brother? Why'd you call me on my phone? I told you I wanted to chat. Right. Tell me. Which is better? Germany or this place? There's no place like this place. Then come back. Is Germany such hot shit? Speaking of shit, I clean people's shit in Germany. I'm a toilet attendant. You... What did you just say? What do you do? I clean up shit. My beloved brother... Remzi Çirci, the brother who most resembles our mother, is cleaning up after people in Germany, you say? Hans comes along, takes a dump and my brother comes up with a napkin. Is that right? Well, not exactly. If you say so. What can I say, Remzi? It pains me. What can I say? What can I say? Sometimes I can't even face my own shit. I flush and leave without looking. But you're right in there with others' shit. And they eat fatty foods. Don't go back, Remzi. Don't do it. You're staying here. We'll put the house in your name. You can run the shop with Muhteşem. You're my favorite big brother. Hicri. Hicri! Good morning darling. What are you doing? You again. My heart stopped. I can't allow that. I'm not done with that heart. Don't touch that. -Why do you care? It's grandad's plug. -Your uncle Vecdi's looking for you. It never ends. You're at each other's throats. I've never seen such a family. Really. There's something I wonder. Has your family always been like this? No. We used to not to be like this. Not at all, when I was little. I had a great childhood. I'd play ball in that garden the whole day, all sweaty. Dad would grill things. My late dad was quite the grill chef. He was so proud. The women performed in the kitchen. We'd sit at the table for hours. My uncles would tell funny stories for hours. Then what happened? Grandad went to the night club, like always. Dad scolded him. Grandad was furious. They had a terrible fight. Grandad threw us out that day. Dad was real upset. Then we went to Istanbul. Dad loved it here. He couldn't manage in Istanbul. After a few years he died of a heart attack. That's how I became an Istanbulite. Dude. Dude, huh? You don't say, buddolia. We're finally speaking the same language, homie. We sure are, mate. You'd better get going. I've got work to do, chum. Alright then, bub. Fine, hadji. Take it easy, babsicle. Thanks, pard. See you later. Take it easy, kankiletto. Kankiletto? I just made it up. Sorry. My aunt turns into a Greek in a tavern when she's mad. -Are those walnuts? -Yes, walnuts. Ticking off walnuts. You two look so alike. I'll pay you one wage from now on. I'm not kidding. Hey, little lion. Don't get cross because I don't pay you. Okay? You'll grow from a seed to a nut seller. Go on. Get going, guys. Back to work. Call me when you make delivery. Come along, Muhteşem. This is your grandad's shop. Measure it well, the whole place. God grant me patience. What's going on? We are taking the new shop's measurements. Muhteşem, do what I said. Measure everything. Tomorrow, or even sooner, this shop will be yours. The chickpeas are still hot. Freshly roasted. Muhteşem. Don't touch anything. Go outside. I'll go outside and measure the front of the shop. Let's see how many centimeter it is. He doesn't know how to stand straight. How could he run a shop? -Greetings. -Welcome, attorney. Thank you. I looked into the title deeds as you requested. Your father has a property you don't know about. -Have a look. -Let me see. Good-bye. A house in Darende and a field. Oh my God. This changes everything. -I'll go check it out. -Oh really? Go off on your own and try to claim them as well, will you? I'm coming too. -Jerk. -Fool. -Loser. -Moron. -Idiot. -Douche. -Tool. -Dumbass. Asshat. You come too. Look after the shop. Besim. Have your apprentice mind my shop for a couple hours. Look, it's so green here. But there is a funny smell. It's mint. Look. What do you mean, mint? It must be stinging nettles. Oh really? Look. It doesn't sting. -Empty words. -Whatever. The soil must be fertile. -I wonder who lives here. -It doesn't matter. What are you doing? Oh my God. Greetings, auntie. See you. -We want to talk to your husband. -When? -Now? -Where? Who? My husband. That's what we ask. Where is he? I don't know. He'd visit the boys. This year he never came. She's nuts. Nuts. Cut it out. Auntie, there's an important matter. Could we come in and talk? Let's talk. About the goods? Yeah. See, she got it right away. To use to sell? First we'll use it. Then we might sell it. What's with all the locks? Come in. Come on in. Come in. Oh boy! I'm fine. There's a thorn. It pricked me. If you want to try it, I'll get you skins. Skins? What do you mean by skins? Animal skins? -We'll go, right Marif? -Why would we stay? Let me get straight to the point. The law of the jungle doesn't apply here. Even if it does seem like a jungle. The house you live in is ours. -I don't understand. -What's not to understand, auntie? The house you've been living in for years rent-free belongs to us. I mean... By "us" I mean all of us. Everyone in Malatya. What are you saying? Auntie, let me congratulate you. But why? We... We are from the Malatya Association for Rejuvenating Yards. MARY. M A R Y. MARY. Let us congratulate you on your beautiful yard. Write it down. Their yard is beautiful. Marif, what should I write? The goods, you say. You were rocking so nicely. Why'd you stop? -Please rock. -The goods, you say. I... What happened? Could I have some water? My throat's dry. For the love of God. Please? Please. Marif, what's going on? What's this MARY? Brother. -Who's that man? -Father. Don't change the subject, Ma... Oh boy! Let's go quick. Father didn't believe in birth control. You know that. If there are other heirs even I wouldn't know what to do. You're right. -Let's go. -Let's go. Welcome, brother. No, no. Not brothers. We're from MARY. Hey. No going without eating. We ate just before we came. Thanks. Look here. We won't let you go until you eat. What? You've gone trouble. Trouble? What trouble? You came all this way. How could it be trouble? Brother... You look familiar, -but who is it? -Me? When I was young they said I looked like Cüneyt Arkın. Let me show you. I'll thrash you! Okay, okay. Why'd you do that? Well... I did a great imitation when I was young. Hilmi. Come here a second. People are all alike in the end. They asked the camel why its neck was crooked and it replied: "What part of me is straight?" Sorry we made you wait. Mum made trotter. I hope you like it. We adore it. Trotter is a life philosophy. It sure landed on its feet. Brother, are you okay? I'm fine. Dig in. Do you eat marrow? There's head, too. What about cheek? We had our fill of cheek. That is, before we came here. -We're from MARY. -What? He'll eat it. Cheek, heart. It's the stuff of life. It needs more salt. Brother, add some salt. No, it's got enough. I seasoned it. Don't piss me off, Arif. Add some salt. No more salt for the trotter. Tell me, is it not salty? We're from MARY. MARY. I've got something to say about the seasoning in this house. You never add pepper. Shake on some pepper. Add some salt. Or else I'll kill you. I'll kill you without a backward glance. -Salt it. -Add some salt already. You've salted plenty. Add some if you dare. Hey! You disgrace me in front of our guests. -Oh no. -How many times have I told you? Huh? No pulling out guns at dinner. Haven't I told you that? We're from MARY. Guys, you've been saying MARY all day. What are you up to? Are you here to get some weed? Why would we want your weed? We've got our own. -Oh. -Yeah. We grow our own. Grow your own, huh? Competitors, are you? Who sent you? Huh? You working for Tahir the Fox? No. Or is it yes? No. Open up. It's me. Open the door. The police are coming. I burnt all the grass. -We've got to get out of here. -Run away. Run and burn down the house. Go. Don't burn down the house at least. Shut up. Now get going. We're from MARY! -Get up, brother. -We're from MARY. MARY. Why won't you understand? Marif! Where are you? Oh boy! What kind of mint is this? It's pungent. It's filling my lungs. Marif. Don't go alone. Where are you? Come to my voice! Where are you? I see you. What's that? How does it float through? My head's spinning. Spinning fast. Snap out of it. Brother, snap out of it. Oh no. Quick, let's run away. God damn pigs are after us. Run! -Step on the gas, Marif. -Yes. -Step on it, Marif. -I am. -Step on it, Marif. -I am. Step on the gas, Marif. Something's missing. -There's no steering wheel. -Why not? It's not here. All I ever had was a steering wheel. And they stole it. How can I live without it? It must be here somewhere. Look around. -What was it like? -Well, it's a... Cute, round thing that turns. Is this it? -Does it turn? -It turns a little. We'll have to make do. What kind of road is this? It never ends. I feel queasy, Marif. Drive slower. I haven't driven yet. It's psychological. You feel driven. My head feels all funny. Marif, my head is terrible. You really do have a terrible head. What's that? What are you doing here? Aliens! They're here to abduct us! What aliens? Get out of the vehicle. These Earthlings won't follow your orders, ET! -Out of the car! -Shoo. Shoo. Marif. I see an unnoticed spot. Let's run over there. Come on. Go! -Brother. -Brother. We'll hide here. We might go days without food or water, Marif. -I'm scared. -Don't be scared. They'll never find us here. What are they doing? They must be high from all that smoke, commander. -Take them into headquarters. -Yes, sir. Sober up. This is delicious. Have you got any more? -What were you doing there? -"What were you doing there?" Look here. Are you making fun of me? If you keep acting so rude they'll beat you in the barracks. Listen, brother. We've been monitoring that house for months. You were in that house. Stop grandstanding. Grandad was there? Really? I didn't see him. I'd tell you if I had. -I didn't see him either. -Nobody was there? Not even my midwife. She was there at my birth. Then she was gone. Midwife! Where have you gone? You abandoned me God give me patience. -Pay cents for patience. -One more word... No criminal records, sir. Good. Throw the dopes inside. Jail them until they are able to make a statement. Hang on, commander. I get a free one. Can I? Good lord. I should get one. Brother. You've got a head for this. -Really? -Yes. I've got a head for this. Look at that head. Didn't I tell you to keep eye on it? Perhaps it was scared when it pooped? Türkan, are you listening? My battery was low. I went to recharge it. Was I supposed to wait here for a goat to poop? You're just like your grandad. Dependent on a plug. God give me patience. Hello. Hodja, the goat pooped when I wasn't there. Could it have been scared? Its poop would be curled. I'm checking, Hodja. Praise the lord. It's curled. How is the animal looking around? Like my mother-in-law at my wedding. Staring blankly. Staring blankly? It wasn't scared. It should look around like a tyrant. Bring me its poop when it does. Thank God I'm beloved in Malatya and they know we're innocent. Marif, not a word to anyone about that house. Last night never happened. Night? What night? What are you talking about? -Dad. -Hey. Look. Muhteşem came. To your health. Your hair looks great. Thanks. Thanks, Muhteşem. What did you say to the others? I said you two went off to dry fruit. Nobody suspects a thing. -Really? -Really. Good for you. Nothing major happened while we were away, right? Kader broke a plate. Nurgül squabbled with my aunts. And Vecdi cut a deal with Remzi and Bora. What? Mutiny, huh? My truck is going to get a speed ticket for the first time. Dear nephews. Let's check to see the agreement is complete. Come along. Marif, look at that. You slimeball! You waste of space. I don't believe it, Vecdi. Did you put them up to it? -Brother, what happened to your head? -Don't... I'll shoot anyone who makes fun of my head. Let's get right to it. What's going on? We saw you were up to no good. So we sorted it out ourselves. And we'd noticed that you always end up with the biggest share. You don't believe in equality. Equality? What's that supposed to mean? Like you founded Cuba, you pimp. No cursing. I'm warning you both. Just sign this and we're done. Got a pen? A pen? -Marif, could we use your pen? -Sure. I'll fetch a pen from the house. Let me see that. They stuck me with the poplar grove. My shop's gone. Come along, Marif. Hold on a second. I know just what to do. Keep cool. Watch as I call Üzerlik. Oh my God. Darling. For the love of God, Üzerlik. Run and give Nurgül the news. She's going to stay here in Malatya with you. Brother, that hair... It happens. It happens. Come with me. You're staying here with Remzi. I'm so happy, Nurgül. Hicri said we'll move next door. We'll raise your child together. I won't go anywhere. We'll do everything together. What's Germany anyway? There's no place like Malatya. You and me, the sisters-in-law. Remzi! Remzi! Unless we go to Germany tomorrow, I'll not only divorce you, I will tear you to pieces. Stay here with them! Look at them. A dope and an idiot. Reach an agreement tonight. Tomorrow we return to Germany. I abstain. It fell through again. Another crisis. Remzi, since you're leaving tomorrow, let's reach an agreement. Here's the deal: Me and Marif will run the shop and share the profits with you. The rent for this house is also yours. If we get a share of the shop, I agree. Deal? I think we have a deal. I get the main shop. Vecdi gets the house. -Bora gets the second shop. -God is great. We stick Marif with the poplars. I get the main shop. You get the rest. All of it. Sounds good to me. Let's eat, I'm hungry. The main shop goes to you two. I get half the house and the small shop. -Sounds good. -Okay. Bora's getting greedy, Remzi. The main shop? -That's not equal. -Hicri gave it to him. Did I? Or is it a tactic? We're back to square one. The three of us united. We're not. They're sticking me with part of the small shop. It's not equal. Sounds good to me. -Uncle Vecdi? -"No way" I said. He ran off and cut a deal with Hicri. So it's you, me and him together. -Who's that, Marif? -I don't know. I've been meaning to ask. Who are you? He doesn't know either. Bora, me and the goat. It's not equal. We're not. -Enough! -Sounds good to me. Enough. The poplars to me, the shop to you. He sets off for Germany tomorrow. Go to bed. Go on. Off we go. I kissed Father. Now it's your turn. Time to go. Remzi, we can talk on the phone or through WhatsApp. I thought all night. My big sister can use my vote. That's great. We can't thank you enough. You've entrusted your vote to me. Remzi, don't worry about a thing. Vecdi. It wasn't nice of you to do that to your big brother. Darling? -What's wrong. -Nothing. I'm fine. Just great. I'm ready. Let's go. Nurgül, are you having labor pains? I'm fine, just fine. How are you? You look well. Here's a present. Come on. Let me kiss you, Marif. I hope to see you in Germany. I'll come and stay for three months. It's coming. Our son's on the way. It's not coming. I'd know if it was. I'd let you know too. Let's go to Germany. Come on. Germany. She's in pain. She doesn't know what she's saying. Muhteşem, get behind the wheel. Remzi, come with us. Hicri, Marif. You come, too. There's no need for me and Bora to come. No way. Leave you here with your two votes? You're coming with us. -Come on. Take the kids inside, Kader. -Okay. -Hurry. Go on inside. You too. Hicri, I'm here. Bora. Why didn't you shut the door? Do you expect me to shut it? He doesn't hear me. I'm old. How can I shut it? Mum, the car won't work. Straight to the hospital, Muhteşem. -No, to the airport. -Darling, the baby is on the way. -The baby will be born in Germany. -Like Germany's such hot shit. It's not hot. Enough of that anyway. We need to get to the hospital. We're going to the airport. There's a fork coming up. Decide. This is a German car. And if you give birth in it? What are you talking about? Drive to the hospital. To the airport! Careful, Muhteşem. Does he think it's a video game? I'm not used to this. Bora, let's have them drop us off at home. So you can make a deal with Bora, right? Pass them already. Listen... If I'm thinking such a thing, may God strike me down. A truck! A truck! I'm dying. You! Why would you stop? -Why would you stop? -I ran out of gas. -Nurgül. -Yes? -I'll get to the point. -Okay. What a wonderful person you are, agreeing to give up Germany. The airport! -Is it okay if I beat uncle up? -Go right ahead. Beat him up! It's not safe here. They're pulling out knives. -Don't be silly. -I want out. Oh, darling. Look at this beauty. Remzi. With this baby, I could be happy anywhere. Really, darling? Let's stay in Malatya, okay? That's fine with me. As long as we're comfortable we can stay here. The house and shop are ours, Remzi. What a sweet little thing. Sweet as his mother. Right, darling? Exactly. Good news, Mum. Nurgül gave birth. Who cares. What good does it do us? Listen, I've got some real news. Son, Ivan scored three goals. A home life's done him good. He did a hot truck or hat trick or something. You're kidding? That's great Put him on the phone. Let me congratulate him. -I'm up in the stands. -Okay. I'll call him. Keep an eye on him. They'll be swarming him now. Don't you worry. Bora, it's a boy, right? That means another heir. Don't be silly. He's three hours old. How could he get a share? -I'm hanging up. See you. -Of course you will, I'm your mother. I know you're my mother. See you. God! Pervin? Hi, my aunt Nurgül had a baby. Hopefully you're next. If I can find a girl who doesn't mind my being from Istanbul. -There are lots of girls in Istanbul. -You don't say. You're beautiful when your tongue is sharp. You should see me curse. -What are you doing this evening? -I'm free. Idle hands are the devil's workshop. Have dinner with me. -You won't stop, will you? -Nope. I get off at 5:30. There's a tea garden called Yeşilgöl. Let's meet there at 6:00. -Are you serious? -Don't make me repeat it. My passionate words finally tricked the coy one Oh, merciful God. I give up. Only a monster could scare it. What are you doing here? Ah, a goat. It got scared and pooped. Praise be to God. Was it constipated? I'm so happy for you. Türkan. Bring a bag, Türkan! It finally pooped! Mum, don't bother. Look at the news. The hodja's a fake. It's on the internet. Let me go. I'll cast a spell on you. I call on Susokka and Meta, on Drogba and Dembaba. -Those are footballer names. -I'm going to pass out. What are we going to do now? What? We're in deep shit. Hello? Hey, Ivan. I've been calling. Why didn't you answer? I didn't hear it. -What's up? -What's all that noise? I made a new deal. You're not even here. I've got a new manager. I'm at his pool party. A new manager? A couple of goals and now this? Are you selling me out? Calm down. You're uptight now. I'll call you later. Okay. Let's stay calm. I'll be back in a couple days. We'll talk face-to-face. Okay? You're confused right now. I see that. What do you mean, neglected you? Do you know what I'm going through here? Don't do this. Just like that. I gave you six years of my life. And you say you found someone else. Don't hang up. Just a... Oh, Pervin. Where are you going? Bora, goodbye. Leave me alone from now on. Okay? -What's going on? -Bora, if you're seeing someone else, -why did you chase after me? -Someone else... Ah, that phone call? I was talking to my footballer. To Ivan. Don't try it. Six years of my life, you said. I neglected you, you said. A footballer, you claim? Here, listen yourself. I'm calling him. Hello... Yes? Stop it. Bora, just to have some fun, did you have to break my heart? What kind of person are you? You're all the same, you know that? -Pervin... -Don't. Why does everyone have it in for me today? So, my beloved family, princesses and esteemed elders. How kind of you. I'll send it right away. Wait a couple minutes. I have asked you to gather today because I wanted a relaxed setting in which to remember the old days of unity and togetherness -by watching a cassette. -I'll stick it in. Son, stop it. -I'll stick it in. -My boy. Kader. Mehmet. Sit back down. Why don't you obey your father? Unbelievable! -Why are you making me yell? -And in front of our guests. Where's the remote? It's Hicri's wedding. Uncle Hicri was so handsome in his youth. I'm still young, dear niece. Where am I? I haven't appeared yet. Oh my! For God's sake, Üzerlik. Must you? I'm such a beauty in that dress. Oh boy! Look at big brother Rıfat. What a big, strong guy. When he danced, all the girls would watch him. My brother was a lady-killer. The bride and groom are ready for the pinning ceremony. The pinning ceremony has started. This ceremony is boring. Let's fast forward. Why fast forward when it's your turn? Muhteşem, continue. You didn't take me to the wedding. Shame on you, uncle. -Good God. -What's it got to do with me? Hey! He took it back. Shame on you. I slipped on three bracelets at your wedding. You thief! What do you mean? I wasn't even married to Kader at the time. You stole all those years, and then did it at my wedding. I'm not letting you get the shop! Oh really? Not so fast. I'm the youngest. And the shop is mine. You've been living it up for years. Now it's my turn. What about our rights? I won't hold my tongue! -What rights do you have? -Uncle is right. You live off your wife. Say something to your husband. Enough! Shut up! What kind of people are you? How'd you come to this? I wish I'd never come. You can keep your properties. I don't want a thing, uncle. Bravo. It's not property you want, it's love. -Whose property? -My property. What makes it yours? Bora! He's got a constricted heart valve. Same as his father. The doctor says he needs a new valve. How can we get him one? I know where we can find it. You've told us many times. But tell us again, doctor. Is there no hope? Unfortunately not. Alright. Let's have a look. Everything is fine. You're doing well. -Thank you. -I wish you a fast recovery. -I hope you're feeling better. -Oh? You broke my heart. See? Your darling is here. -Who's my darling? -I'll call her in, you'll see. Come on in! Bora. It's your mum. What did they do to you? What did they make you eat? It was fatty foods, right? No, I made chicken. White meat is healthy. I followed a recipe. Do I have to defend myself? Why do you make me do this? -It was chicken... -Kader. -What? -You're out of control again. How are you doing, Bora? May he rest in peace. -Exactly, Bora. My condolences. -Lots of them. What a dope. I see what you meant by darling. How are you, Ivan? Did your manager let you come? It didn't work out, Bora. There's someone new. Super. -Who's this new dickhead? -That dickhead is your mother. You hear that? -Shut up! -What? Shut up! We should thank the family of whoever gave me the heart valve. Are they here? They are, all of them. But there's no need to thank them. Dad. Now is not the time. If his heart kept beating, it was for a reason. Your grandad was waiting for you. Wow. -The valve is from grandad. -Yes. You can't beat that! ONE YEAR LATER Fair play, fair play. Don't pull. Be careful. Don't wear yourself out, bro. Don't worry. I won't, homie. Muhteşem, what has the meat done to deserve this? I'm afraid you'll burn down the poplar grove next. What's this? I plan opening an Internet café in the grove, father. I looked around. There aren't any. Ah, they're calling. Yes, I'm the entrepreneur bringing the net to the grove. The sujuk is perfect his time. Really spicy. Cook it last. A butterfly again. Shoo. I thought butterflies lived for only a day. Why have they been bugging me for a whole year? Mehmet, the pool is full. Why is the water running? Let me have that. Have fun playing. Don't splash.
