I can not hear you... They can't hear us ... ... I'm losing pressure ... What is happening? Something is interfering with us ... ¡May Day, May Day! I can not control it! Your Organization can be considered modern, Sr. Kemp... Thrush, now has nuclear power Sr. Kowalski... although their conversation and questioning are exhilarating, This is the only Thrush I have ever seen A songbird of the thrush family relative of the blackbird and ... I'm not playing, Sepheran No, of course not Don't know how to play You don't know the sophistication of the guidelines ... If you are the model of the new and modern, CIPOL agent I must confess that I have been very disappointed I find his questioning aggressive, without sympathy or finesse Napoleon Solo would have asked the same questions, but I would have done it in style Illya Kuriakyn, it would have made his blood run cold , without revealing any emotion Both prior to their time, of course A sample of what is currently happening A vain world, without grace or style a threat to society And now I 've had enough of you, Mr. Kowalski, can tell that to his superiors If you'll excuse me, our interview ended Remember the stripe on the inmate's jeans 155960 I must go to my cell now Incidentally, speaking of superiors, my condolences for A. Waverly a man of true style Open the door! Open it now! Give me the keys! Style! Excuse me...

Well, long ago I belonged to Naval Intelligence, tell me about the HR957 artifact He was shot down more than 30 km from Anchorage I assume he was not armed? No. We have the only person in the country who could do it, under strict custody, who neither cockroaches could get close to it Thrush has no luck Thrush, I haven't heard that name in 15 years You know Justin Sepheran escaped two days ago Do you understand what I'm saying? Our languages ​​are very similar, Mr. Kowalski What do you think Sepheran wants? Probably your country SOMEWHERE IN LIBYA Your report We have the artifact, but ... But what? Bergmann died last night in Helsinki Pneumonia. We didn't know they were that bad Now we have no one to set the bomb We will find someone Come, Guido Piers Castillian Welcome home, Commander The only man I could trust such monumental work Come with me Everything is going according to your orders All the specialists you requested are here including Janus Thrush organization is up and running again It's like it's never dissolved And now that you are back, no power on Earth will stand in our way The other arrangements?

That H957 artifact is a set of loose wires, it's disassembled Only three people in the world could put it together One is under surveillance Schmidt in Berlin is isolated and charges cyanide, Bergmann, the Swede, died of pneumonia last night ... And the other? The one who designed the H957, Carlton Pennington Smithe, your countryman, died 6 months ago, Sepheran is bluffing Perhaps, Mr. Kowalski, i am prepared for that The ransom delivery site, we will be told tomorrow night which means we have 72 hours There is another curious request, on demand the ransom must be delivered by a former CIPOL agent specifically, Napoleon Solo Who is that guy Your bet, Mr ... Alone, Napoleon Alone Yes, I know it is ... my turn You seem to be hesitating, Mr. Solo, surely the sum of U $ S 5000 it's nothing for a capitalist of its kind My class?

Because I don't want to comment on it We share many things in the past, our uncle says it was a mission in Yugoslavia, a young woman was killed Death is a part of the trade ... Yes for us You were responsible for the young woman, weren't you? Didn't CIPOL support you? Yes, I had support This is one of the organizers of Sepheran, a fat and elusive named Alexis Kemp, arrived this morning, from the North of the state, is at the Blakemore Hotel How many times do I have to tell you?

Hard Our English friend does not think that something threatens him Tell him I'm seeing his threat about to take a shower Through the window? Don't worry, I'll close my eyes Just a moment... I think our friend from Thrush is going to wash his feathers Outside He is not concerned that his knowledge will kill him That's what Thrush has Hello Hello Who are you? Telephone repairman. Has a fault on the line Why is he coming at this time of night? Because I couldn't come before We received notice from the hotel at five o'clock; At six, my boss called, but the manager left, at eight the night manager called and at nine, my boss called me to New Jersey, to come You do not know what the traffic on the George Washington Bridge I should be happy that I could come Listen I'm an actor, not a technician, I couldn't put the bomb together even if I wanted to But he has made the plans with his father and has a photographic memory You say my life is in danger The only attack that I hope is that of the critics, -They worry about nothing. -You believe? He competed in the New York marathon three days ago Yes, I came in at number 2093, a good place Before starting, he changed shirts with another runner Yeah i gave him my lucky shirt And he collapsed from exhaustion, didn't he? Maybe Thrush planned it that way because they thought it was you, by the registration number Just a moment. How could Thrush crash him? With calming darts Has been long in espionage Truthfully, I'm new to this, I try to tell him that Thrush tried to kidnap him, without me knowing and they will try again Mr. Solo, this is our first night on Broadway I have friends waiting for me in five minutes As far as I'm concerned, there is no Thrush Hey, what are you doing! Leave me alone! -Enough! -What are you doing, aiming at me? This is New York, we already have robbers, we don't need outsiders I did my job. I raised the briefcase to see the cables The briefcase ...

Let go of me! What are you doing? Reassuring dart ... Take it off! Open Channel D Here Raleigh We lost it How did you know Pennington Smithe's dressing room phone ? It is basic information They knew we had four cars there three decoy agents similar to Pennington Smithe, all in different directions, but only a guarded car It was a trap, they were waiting for us -Mr. Alone, we received the rescue instructions, the Excelsior in Tripoli. -Thank you Part tonight What do you think of those? Tripoli ... maybe Thrush headquarters is near the drop site I'll put the name "Angel" on the Section 4 computer And regarding the lake, I don't know, maybe it's Kemp's vacation site There is something out of focus in the background I do not know. We will have to find out I told Smithe that I had to worry, with a CIPOL agent at your side Kowalski maybe he's right, I'm old for this -Are you not exaggerating? Thrush found out -Because I was walking with Smithe You are an agent of CIPOL, it was expected that it was with a lure Yes. That's what i thought You received the communication about doubles by Sir John Where were you? At the Penthouse, I came back to make sure ... ... and Andrea was there, before I moved to the theater Kemp... -It's Janus. -Yes, Janus -We have the plane ready, warn the pilot The load is already on the plane, at Campo Fort Lorian, Hangar 41 bring your pilot license and personal identification -Have the US $ 2000 ready -It's ready, half now, half upon arrival -I'll be in an hour Kuriakyn, 555- 4247 I have the address Are you sure Janus won't recognize you? We never saw each other ... It was only a moment If you know where the leak is , you better fix it -Illya ... -I will live, you too Yes, now I know where the leak is ... Napoleon, please! You're the only one I hear about Pennington Smithe! in fact I analyzed it well ... Thrush has monitored all our movements very well, I should have known someone was inside, but like Kowalski said, I'm rusty You went to a lot of trouble, for that casino scene, you are a very good actress ... especially that night Napoleon, that was sincere ... Sure, as real as in your movies Who do you connect with in Thrush, where is the headquarters? I want to know what your next step will be? Now! They have my father, he is a physicist, ... he was kidnapped in Naples I had to do what I was told! I had to do it! Try again Napoleon, it's the truth , I swear! I said try again Napoleon, please, couldn't ...! Don't take me! Please i don't want to go please -Not...! Where are you taking me? -Get up! -Did the pilot arrive? -The pilot is here Haven't I seen it before? I am used to transporting many people around the world I don't remember names or faces Maybe he found it wise to forget I transport it wherever I want to go, I don't ask questions or answer them 1000 now and 1000 upon landing Change that machine of place! Janus's plane landed this morning, everything is ready -And Mr. Solo? -He arrived in Tripoli this afternoon, he has already registered Monitor Mr. Solo's footsteps When we are ready, you will contact the Twenty hours... I'm used to the heat, we fry eggs on the sidewalks, but this ... is heat All right, the pay just came in, 350 million in gems and we, with a fortune, unable to search for Thrush headquarters But I don't think it's close I would not be so sure... coming from the airport, I saw Guido, in another car, heading straight into the desert Guido, similar to King Kong? Sepheran's bodyguard It feels good? Between darts and blows to the head, he is prone to accidents Did this happen to you in the old days? Maybe it was faster, in the old days What have you got there? I took it from the reception, not that we can ski, but ... -Where is this lake? -A few kilometers from the city What is this behind? A kind of prey ... The Angelis Dam, closed 20 years ago, The hotel concierge told me Tourists used to go there, but they banned it a month ago I thought those things only happened in my neighborhood Angel ... and nobody has been for a month -Kowalski, you are great! -Thank you... Get him inside! I hope you enjoy our pool, Mr. Smithe We specially build it Armela I said I don't know how to do it You know it is not true. He has a photographic memory, he is an artist, duplicated all the plans of his father I will not do it ¡Armela! Set the time 18 hours 17 minutes 44 seconds I must tell you, I'm not sure I can take it apart I don't think you're asked to do it Open Channel D Channel D open, Mr. Kuriakyn I'm in Chicago, underground Pennington Smithe and two Thrush agents are here Where is here? I do not know. I'll let you know when I find out It hears hectic I just swam the English Channel Than? Forget it out I wouldn't go too close, it has a very sensitive mechanism I've been waiting for you, Mr. Kuriakyn Did you decide to come see me, Mr. Solo? -Is it isolated enough for you? -Yes, this is fine, I ... I wanted our first conversation to be in private no witnesses This is my good friend, Guido Yes, we already met ... Well Napoleon Solo, it's been a long time nothing has really changed Neither you, Sepheran ... It is reckless with age, threatening nuclear weapons, it 's dangerous, it could go wrong And bring the world to an end, right? Suppose I kill you and force the pilot to take me to your headquarters? Who knows that the bomb is not there and that time is running Will bring the ransom to this very spot, tomorrow at noon What form of presentation does it have? In gems Well, more beautiful than the paper for tomorrow or the artifact will detonate At that time, I will warn them to stop counting How? Just by pressing a button, it will send a signal Also, I must mention, that there is a second button, if the ransom is not delivered, or you do not go alone; will tighten And then the bomb will be detonated Exactly There is a special key, which I will send a deviant word or I don't communicate ... What will prevent me from not pressing the button, after receiving the ransom? Mr. Solo, this is a business transaction , we are professionals Respect your part and I will respect mine We must be men of our words or there would be no more integrity Integrity has been the foundation of Thrush's philosophy I have a code to make this commercial transaction What would that code be? I use a good person to get to me, when he accomplished his goal, he took it from me. Unwrap it for me Why do you think you can trust her now? I believed him when he said that Thrush had his father, Also, her gorilla for hire got her out of my hair He enjoys his job . Okay ... I will bring them with me Hey, it's much better than the last time we saw each other, better color Tomorrow before noon, Napoleon Solo. Come on, Guido What did Sepheran say? Go to the same place today, tomorrow at noon, alone with the gems Not kidding Failure to pay, part of the US will disappear If we pay, it's crazy enough to detonate it just the same Open Channel D Channel D open, Mr. Solo Is there any news from Kuriakyn? No, since the last communication Okay, keep monitoring Even without news Should be reported every 6 hours We know it landed this morning and the young Englishman accompanied him Maybe he is not in a position to answer You know, I was starting to like Chicago We'll be fine if we take the chain Have you already been in this position? Frequently And how did you get free? With an explosive charge on my watch And now where do you carry it? In my shoe And why did they change it? Progress Somehow I knew that I was a CIPOL agent Unfortunately they too You knew Janus from before That was a long time ago I think I should know the name of the man I'm going to die with Not that it matters, but why did they put the bomb down here What is above is what matters Up? Janus was so kind to explain it to me Tomorrow at noon an Arab president will give a speech, sympathetic to the West, will bring the protesters of all time -And the explosion will kill them all -It will also destroy the country's energy program It will be like a nuclear accident I must confess I don't know what he's talking about It will be like a nuclear accident I must confess I don't know what he's talking about We are hanging under the nuclear reactor Ashfield Reactor nuclear That's ... The Angelis Dam Thrush's new headquarters Yes, Mr. Solo Sir John, I'm sure Thrush is operating under the dam, we must change plans Explain yourself My name is CIPOL again, because I know Sepheran I jailed him 15 years ago, Now that I talked to him, I convinced myself that the bomb would still detonate, we pay the ransom or not -What do you have in mind? -Organization is required, I will need a CIPOL attack team , here Tomorrow we will attack the dam, 20 minutes before the set time Isn't it risky? If you are only right about Sepheran, we could stop counting A strike group will be ready I want the group to be supervised by Kowalski Very generous! Where will you be, friend? I will be inside, friend I will try it again Illya, can I help you with something? I will do something that maybe works Was that our last chance? -What is that? -Close your eyes Cut here -How much left? - Twenty minutes How long will it take to disarm it? I don't know if I can do it, I must search the planes in my mind How many guards do you open? None You won't see anyone from Thrush, 50 meters from that thing We are going now... Great! Fast! Get moving, quick! Detonation time: 15 minutes and counting They entered through the doors of Section B Activate the monitors Let's go! Are they covered? How not to fail with that1 Ahead! Get covered! Ahead! -It is improving -It passes with age Where's Andrea? Where is the woman? In the store Point it out! Come on, simánme Rest I'm getting better All runners look alike! I do not know where to start... From the beginning -How much time do we have? -Nine minutes Keep working Stupid! Detonation time: 8 minutes, 6 seconds The woman and her father ... kill them It's done, Commander ... from point B ... wait That's... Enter the positive ... ... point D ... Which short ...? Couldn't he stay alone to kill me? So is First, I wanted to see him sweat a little, That bomb will explode in minutes! There are only six men who know how to assemble the H957 artifact Two are dead, the third is in Washington, the fourth, Schmidt, is in Berlin, the fifth is young Pennington Smithe ... and you are the sixth Yes i am the sixth man Your talents are greater than I thought Schmidt from Berlin, he 's my uncle I helped him work on the H957 artifact If he could do it, why force Smithe? Why didn't you do it yourself? For Thrush's agents to tell Sepheran? No, that would not have gone with my plans ... You will keep the artifact So he got involved with Thrush. Very good, Mr. Kuriakyn Why not steal the bomb on the spot? Did he just shoot down the bomber? I didn't think Thrush trusted me His agents surrounded me all the time Kidnapping Smithe to put it together, made Thrush believe that everything was going according to Sepheran's plans because the moment of detonation has come, naturally all Thrush agents would leave Of course Leaving you alone You have already grasped the situation, Mr. Kuriakyn I guess if you can put the bomb together , you can take it apart It is somewhat more complicated, but yes, I can take it apart That means that CIPOL paid 350 million for nothing. and I have what everyone wants, exposed to highest bidder, including Thrush Keep playing the same game ... of betrayal and deception And if you try to stop me from killing him, killing me, no one will take the bomb apart, Smithe won't be able to do it and will be condemning everyone to death including the state Interesting problem. He must have killed me in that day Adiós, Sr. Kuriakyn Quick! Check that out men Bring my things! Detonation time: 4 minutes, 30 seconds ¡Castillian!

We meet again I guess you don't want to argue about this? I told you we should discuss it I have already disconnected many cables and I've also gone over various planes in my mind, this must be the last one, red or blue ... I don't know which one to cut! If you cut the correct one? The clock will stop -If you cut the wrong one? -It will explode Mr. Solo ... Yes it was red Good -Illya ...? -... It was red! Good Where the hell have you been? I thought a vacation in Libya would suit me well Libya? Dry air, good for the lungs, but I think Thrush will have to find another barracks Good -Do you know something? -Than? All of this seemed easier fifteen years ago And it was -How about Sepheran? -Could escape Another glass please Did you say goodbye to Andrea for me? -What do you think he's been doing? -Thank you By the way. What happened to Sepheran? He disappeared. But for sure, Sir John will know about Thrush, again The rescue? Changed in cash and deposited in banks What a pity! I would have liked to have it in my hands ... ...just for a moment Did you clarify your matter with Janus? I clarified How about Pennington Smithe? His performance outside Chicago was very good.
