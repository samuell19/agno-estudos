Leave it. - What is it? Peyote. A local, highly powerful hallucinogenic. This shit... could flatten a football team. It's for me! - For tonight! - Hey. This, plus weapons, is a guaranteed accident, you fucking morons. A few years ago, a Polish guy got so high on this shit, he sawed his own leg off without feeling a damn thing. He died without a drop of blood in his body. (WHISTLES) Here you go, beautiful. Could you go and hide it somewhere safe? (♫ DANCE MUSIC ♫) Uh-oh, here comes trouble. (CATCALLS) (CATCALLS) Oh, yeah! No, no no no. No. Wow. (DOOR CLOSING) Hey! There she is. Oopsie, hang on a sec. There we go. (DRAGGING) Oh. Richard went to give our passports to the gamekeeper. It'll take him all morning. Oh. And Dimitri is nursing a hangover. Which will also take all morning. (AWKWARD LAUGH) So. It's just the two of us. (♫ TENSE MUSIC ♫) - I'm gonna start packing. - Oh. If I want to be ready on time. (♫ DRAMATIC MUSIC ♫) Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Oh, no, it's okay, you just surprised me, that's all. Hey, this is a nice bedroom. Yes, it is. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) You know, it really is a shame we didn't have more time to get to know each other better. Call me when you can. We could do... a thing or two... together. I don't know if I'll have time with work. Oh, work. (LAUGHS) (CLEARS THROAT) So now you're a fucking politician. (SHORT LAUGH) What is it you don't like about me? No, nothing. I just want to know, so... tell me. What is it you don't like about me? You're... You're not my type, that's all. Oh. Why am I not your type? You're... you're too small. Oh. I like taller guys, that's all. There we go! (LAUGHTER) (SIGHS) And I haven't changed height since yesterday, have I? I asked you a simple question. Even for your tiny little oyster brain, it shouldn't be too difficult to understand. So, I'll ask you again. Did my height change since yesterday? No. And yet, you seemed to like me yesterday. No, but I... Yeah, yeah, yeah. When we were dancing together last night, everything was very clear. You came onto me like a pussy in heat, rubbing yourself against me, turning me on. And now, suddenly, I'm not your type? Like that, boom. During the night, I've become too small for you. (SLAMS) Yesterday, you were dying for it. And now you're apparently... Stop. Richard will be back anytime soon. (MOCKING) Oh, Richard.

Everything's okay. I fixed everything. I made a few phone calls to find you a job. In Canada. It's practically Los Angeles. That's the amount I transferred to an account for you, you can use it as you please. Jen, this is the possibility to change your life, to fulfill your dreams. I want to go home right now. Call that fucking helicopter. Baby, baby, baby... Don't act like a child. You know that's not possible. If you love me, think about me. Okay, they fucked up big time, but you're so damn beautiful, it's hard to resist you. Come on. Jen, they'll come and apologize and we'll forget about the whole thing. You call the goddamn helicopter! Or I'll call your wife and tell her everything! Who the fuck do you think you are? You little whore. You dare threaten me or fuck things up in my life? Don't you ever talk about my wife. Don't you ever say her name. (CRYING) (♫ DRAMATIC MUSIC ♫) Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! Jen, look at me. I'm sorry about the slap. I didn't mean to hurt you. It's just... stress. I lashed out without thinking. Give me your phone. Give me the fucking phone! I'm calling the chopper, I don't want to hear another word about it. What a fucking mess. Hey Roberto, it's Richard. How are you? I'm very good, thank you. Listen, we planned a pick-up at 2:30pm. Yeah. And I would like to make it earlier. Yeah, as soon as possible. Perfect. Okay, thanks.
