BLUEBEARD Anne de Rocligon. Yes, come on. Why are we going to the Mother Superior? I don't know. Sister Barbe, you listen to the doors. You know everything. I assure you, I know nothing. The lie by omission is a sin. But I don't sin. I know nothing at all. - Where is Marie-Catherine? - She's not here? Sister Barbe, you always respond to a question. Sorry, my mother. I had warned her. Find me that child and make haste. Right away, my mother. Mademoiselle Anne, you are witness. The time, it's time. We strive to teach you. Your little sister did not assimilate this elementary courtesy, which is the courtesy of kings. It's simply bad manners. Do you have the right to come here? Mother didn't forbid us. But it's me who should watch over you. You say... Don't go too quickly, Catherine. I love looking around. Can we really come here? It's an extraordinary place for me. Come look at this old book. It's mine! Alright. Alright. We'll exempt ourselves from waiting for her. Nevertheless, I'll ask you to be very courageous and strengthen your faith for the degree of this tragedy. Mademoiselle, your Lord, in His great goodness, has chosen to take back... I said... Your Lord, in His great goodness, chose to take back your father. He threw himself under the wheels of a cart to save a child. Don't cry for his loss, but rejoice in the glory of his sacrifice. He has joined the kingdom of heaven. Come on. Hasn't one of you learned strength of character? No show of useless tears. Don't return to your classes. Get in your dorms. You will take care of all your affairs. Your condition does not allow you to stay here longer. We're a private school, not a charity organization. Yes! I won, I won, na na na. Yes. There it is. You lost. - No. It's behind the armchair. - That's it. What do you think? If it's not there, we do another. You're already all dirty. It's as if you want to be dirty. You're a tattletale. It's me, the big sister. Ooh la la! Ooh la la! You're never happy. Now, get in the car. Your father will always watch over you from the heavens. - We don't say goodbye? - Useless. May God watch over you. Anne, look. This is so beautiful. It's incredible that that could belong to someone. How was it constructed? Carrying all the rocks up... There are the miserable ones who sweat, and there are the rich. Someday, I'll live in a huge castle. Always dream. This is the work of war. A strong place against invasions. What invasions? There are always some. Barbarity is everywhere. Jeannot, to whom does the castle belong? To Bluebeard. A very rich lord, but very bloody with all the women. Why? His spouses all disappeared at the end of a year. He had to kill them. - Don't listen. - It interests me. There are also girls who disappeared. Why doesn't he go to prison? The justice of the rich and the justice of the poor. - That's not justice, then. - Yes. You never understand anything. Yes. I will become very rich. Ah yes? How? - It's none of your business. - You're delirious. Yes. But the mother superior, I'll have her strangled, I'll suspend her by her hair and watch her die, and join the kingdom of heaven. Stop. Dad has just died. It's nervous. I can't believe he's dead. Nevertheless, we'll all end up like that. Don't come in. You're too little. Anne! Anne! Anne, come over here! Anne... Why did you put on that dress? You should never wear a dress like that. Quick, quick! Come on! Come on, help me. What will become of you? Two girls... How could I marry you off? Your father hasn't left us anything. Only debts. You'll have to enter the convent. It's the only solution. No thank you. I'd as soon be buried alive. He hears us. He hears us! He could have taken care of us. You act as if he wasn't your father. I'd rather die. Why did you tint all your clothing? You want to bury us with dad, is that it? He's dead, at least! He chose it. I did not choose to be the living dead. I don't know how mom grooms you. You're really ugly. - What are you doing? - I'm making you a little more beautiful. Ouch! Be careful. I'm making you a bit prettier. Mom has no taste. There. You're prettier. Ooh la la... - I'll be the one to read. - Again? I cry when he wants to kill her. - But he can't kill her. - That makes me cry. I'm sensitive. "The Little Siren," you'll weep too. The end is better. Are you starting? - "The Little Siren" or "Bluebeard"? - "Bluebeard." "There once was a man who had beautiful houses "in the city and in the country, beautiful dishes, "with embroidered furnishings and guilded designs. "But he had a blue beard." In the palace markets In the palace markets There's a very beautiful girl, Lonla There's a very beautiful girl She has so many lovers She has so many lovers She doesn't know which to take, Lonla She doesn't know which to take This is a little cobbler This is a little cobbler Who has his preference, Lonla Who has his preference Daddy dear... You're handsome like that. You seem younger. You resemble a statue. A very cold statue. All the more intimidating. I love you. I'm saying goodbye. It doesn't scare me to see him dead. He's much more handsome. You aren't going to kiss him? I want him to be dead. I want him dead. - He didn't do it deliberately. - Yes. He chose to save a child. He didn't think about us, how he risked making us orphans. We didn't matter. He didn't think about us for a second. I hate him. With all my soul. You always want to be loved. You love nobody. Don't reproach him for listening to his heart. Fool! I reproach who I want. It's his fault if he's dead, not mine. She's a fool. She knows not what she says. When God has time, he'll take him to heaven. We bury the dead on earth because God has work to do. - Do you believe that dad could die? - Yes. Would we no longer have a house? Yes. It's being kept for us. He wouldn't have any more need. In the palace markets In the palace markets There's a very beautiful girl There's a very beautiful girl She has so many lovers Vultures! And there, we'll sleep Until the end of the world Lonla Until the end of the world Jackals! Shitpiles! What will become of us? You have only your eyes for crying. This family disgusts me. She doesn't say what she thinks. She's miserable. "One of their neighbors, a woman of quality, had two girls. "He asked her for one in marriage. "She would decide which girl to give to him. "Neither of the girls wanted him, "not being able to resolve to take a man with a blue beard." Do you understand? Bluebeard, very ugly but very rich, - one must be poor to love him. - No. A woman of quality isn't so poor. Keep reading. Alright. Take these, mother. Like that, you'll run out of energy. What a state your arms are in! Are there two girls without a dowry of age to get married? It's cruel to scoff at a family that knows misery. My girls have no dowry. Who will want them? Bluebeard. I'll never give him one of my girls. If you'd told me that, I wouldn't have received you. Come on. You no longer have the means to make due with difficulties. Nothing is so terrible, look around you. Sir Bluebeard is rich. He would be generous with you. If you devote yourself to him, your fortune is made. Think about it. I've told you all you need to know. Don't refuse this deal. I know him. Sir Bluebeard knows how to make himself... presentable. He sends you an invitation to meet him and choose between the young girls. You see, you're obligated nothing if you accept. Let's go visit the big castle. I'm sensitive. You're even afraid of what's not true. No. I'm not scared. I'm sick. That hurts my ears. - You say it doesn't matter. - It's not my fault. It's my brain that reflects. - Your brain is yours. - No, it was given to me. Alright. Can I resume my reading? "He had already married several women. "No one knew what became of them. "Bluebeard, to make himself known, "led them with their mother, three of their best friends, "and kids from the neighborhood to one of his country houses. "where they stayed eight days." If you hadn't tinted my dress, I'd feel a little better. They'll make fun of us. It's simple, I'm ashamed. I want to leave. Wearing mourning clothes is not shameful. I don't care about others. This beautiful young lady having fun... - They're of age. - They're not bad. Our host puts on a good show. It's better than nothing. He's not appetizing. If he believes in marrying someone young... He has the choice. And we won't choose him. Do you never dance? What would I seem like? It's necessary to be aware of who you are. You like to see them dance without you? They have fun by themselves. I like to be surrounded by young people having fun. Go on, dance, you too. No one invites me. As if I didn't exist. They will. My sister is more beautiful. Your roles will be reversed. You must only wait. Me, I won't change. - I am a monster. - Surely not! They look at me like a monster. I understand. In effect, I become a monster. A sort of ogre, do you understand? Yes. And don't I scare you? No. I'm more afraid of the invisible wickedness. "The younger daughter found that the master was an honest man. "Upon returning to the city, the marriage was concluded. No. She's too young. No, she's old. Before, they got married as early as birth. You're nuts. They got married even at 5 years. But it was different when they married bigger. I don't know how. Wait, I'm thinking. - You're pretending. - No. I'm thinking. Is that alright, Mademoiselle? That seems perfect to me. - There won't be a more beautiful bride. - No. I'd like to show myself to my sister. She's not going to come back. Be careful! - You'll ruin my work. - No. Anne, Ida, look. This is the first dress made for me. A dress that no one wore. That's a change, no? - She seems beautiful suddenly. - I can't believe it. - She thinks herself there, poor girl. - This Bluebeard is so ugly. - I pity her. - Not me. She is jealous. She dreams of surpassing you. That will teach her. Anyway, she's so young. That breaks my heart. What do you want to happen to him? What are you plotting? Nothing. You are transfigured. Mademoiselle, come back! Marie-Catherine, come back immediately! You're incapable of keeping your own clothing. I'm a pig. I always get dirty. Starting tomorrow, I'll do what I want. I can't wait. Mademoiselle, I must finish the alterations! I'm coming. You'll come see me. You won't abandon me. There's more reason to than not. Plenty. But I like it that way. - I love you when you play the victim. - Me too. I treated you poorly. I didn't care. I devastated your room and you were scolded. The marriage of Bluebeard is difficult because he kills children. He has a huge pot in which he cooks children, a small trap door to recover the eggs and a ladle to recover the girl. And then, he eats her. That's how he gets fatter. And he meets a green ogress with big teeth. You're mixing everything up. You're an idiot. Ah yes? What is it then, your marriage? It's when two people love each other. In front of everyone, they put beautiful rings on each other. And an ogress comes to eat them. Stop with the ogress! The bride has a beautiful wedding gown. - And she becomes an ogress. - Stop it! - She's beautiful. - Bluebeard devours everyone. Then I'll explain to you the truth of it. Marriage, it's two people who love each other. One day, they want to become homosexuals. But yes, it's true. "Homosexuals," it's two boys or two girls who love each other. Stop talking about that. No. It's when they fall in love. Is your beard really blue? You won't be scared, will you? No. I didn't expect it. I like it better like this. - You're a strangle little person. - How's that? You have the innocence of a dove and the pride of an eagle. What you say pleases me. Yes. But take care that that pride never becomes vanity. Then, you'll be lost. Scary stories make me laugh. You never laughed reading that. - I laugh in my head. - It doesn't matter. Ah no. If mom saw that, she'd be furious. I didn't sleep with you before you were old. What did I do wrong? I had this little bed purchased. I'm not a dog. You must snore like an ogre. If I don't have my own room in such a castle, I'll return to live with mom until I turn 20. I thought it was the right thing to do. I want a room of my own size. You aren't authorized to return. This must be my place. At the house, I had to slide into my sister's bed. Everything was made up for her. I was the last one. Here. No. It's too big. There. This shelf is unworthy of you. I'd like to see. You're sure that it suits you? This will be my room. I want no other. Other pieces are more sumptuous. When I come of age. Here, this will be my secret place. No one will have the right to enter. Never. I'm too big to enter. My husband will always be too big for me. Did I upset you? No. As long as you tell me the truth, nothing will upset me. Goodnight. Sweet dreams. I want to keep reading. After the marriage, she becomes royalty, she's rich... You're speaking out of interest! You're jealous! - I don't see of what. - Of me. I'm more intelligent. I'm in your class. Because I was sick. - I skipped a class. - You'll repeat. Next year. While you wait, I have a year in advance. Ouch. This is Fomitopsis pinicola. That, that's a Boletus piperatus. Repeat. - Boletus piperatus. - Boletus piperatus. Another Boletus piperatus. In the palace markets In the palace markets There's a very beautiful girl Lonla There's a very beautiful girl She has so many lovers She has so many lovers She doesn't know which to take Lonla She doesn't know which to take This is a little cobbler This is a little cobbler Who has his preference Lonla Who has his preference And it's in the street And it's in the street It's my sister Anne who sang it. I like her a lot, your voice. It's very simple. I sing false. Not for me. If you had heard Anne... You're depressed, without your sister. No. But she misses me. But I'm delighted to be rid of her. "Bluebeard tells his wife "that he had to travel in the province for at least 10 weeks "for an important matter." The keys to two large furniture depositories. The one for the gold dishware and for the money. The one to my safes, with my gems. The master key that opens all the apartments. Open everything. Go everywhere. It's all for you. Smile, don't make that face. - I'm sad to see you leave. - Come on now. I'm leaving enough for you to want to find me again. While you wait, promise me you'll take advantage of my absence. Have fun. See your sister and friends. I don't have any. Live the life of your age. I don't like to see anyone anymore. I'm an old scalded wolf, unexcited by anything. Your beard stopped being blue. Don't you like it better? Less. I was used to it. You can trust me. I can take care of myself. Look me in the eyes. - Why? - Look me in the eyes. Where is my wife? Isn't luxury every day wearying, with no one to share it with? No. I'm used to it. I don't even notice it anymore. As if I always lived like this. I couldn't do it any other way. It seems like you've forgotten my return. But it was so long, so endless... I was so sad. You ordered me to have fun. Then I stopped counting the days. You're here, and I didn't wait for you. What a magnificent surprise. Oh, I'm so happy! Do you remember my first time here? I was filled with wonder. Tonight, it's even more beautiful. It's like I'm in the den of a secular eagle, made to protect me. Me. Me alone. And we overcome the terrible vanity of the world. Tell me... Will we resume our life as before, just the two of us? I feel sad for you. Aren't you upset with me? I have the appetite of a bird, and I eat the eggs of birds. I never ate enough. I'm there. "The Chinese remembered one eclipse "that occurred under emperor Chung Kang "during the time of the fall equinox, "the year 2155 B.C. "According to them, in about 2500 B.C., "five planets were brought together in the same constellation, "and the same day, they observed the new moon. "They wondered if it had arrived." But, you see, the calculations that corroborate Professor Kirsch's findings make the thing without a doubt. They placed the conjunction in 2443 B.C. You'll teach me everything. I'm so ignorant. I'll teach you everything I can. But you must also learn by reading. That will occupy you during the time of my next absence. You know that I must set off again soon. For very long again? Yes, long, my child. I regret having to abandon you. Take me. I can't. It's useless. I won't have parties anymore. You'll do what your heart tells you. Did I scold you last time? I'll invite my sister. No one else. I'm giving you these keys for whatever use you want. But on the other hand, this small key, this is the one to the office at the end of the gallery of the low stairway. I entrust it to you, Madame. But I forbid you from entering there. "She promised to observe all that was ordered for her. "He, after kissing her, "climbs on his horse and leaves for his trip. "As if urged by the curiosity, "she descended a robed staircase "with so much haste she thought she'd break her neck. "Arriving at the office door, "she stopped there for some time, thinking about her husband's order "and considered that she could encounter misfortune by disobeying. "But she could not overcome the temptation. "She took the small key and opened the office door. She saw nothing, for the windows were closed." I'm not scared. I'm not scared... I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. "After a moment, "she started to see that the floor was covered with blood, "in which the bodies of several women gazed at themselves, "dead and attached to the walls. "These were all the wives of Bluebeard, "whose throats he had slit, one after the other. "She resumed her direction, collected the key, "closed the door, and went up to her room to rest. "But she could not breathe, she was so shocked..." You, Monsieur? You left only yesterday. My return doesn't distress you, I hope? I didn't expect to see you so soon. I'm surprised myself to be here so quickly. I couldn't resolve to leave you for such a long time. What's wrong, Madame? You're pale. I was so sad for your departure. I didn't eat a thing. We'll eat something then. I'm very hungry too. Madame, you won't see malice on my part, but you must return the keys to me. We can't exempt ourselves from this rule. Of course. I don't see the gold key. Did I forget to put it back? You know I need it. I misplaced it. I forget where I put it. You have done what was forbidden. No. I didn't enter. Why is there blood on this key? I don't know anything. You don't know anything? But I know, I do. You wanted to enter the office. And well, Madame, you will enter there too. You will take your place among those ladies. Forgive me. I truly repent having disobeyed you. I know that this is unpardonable. I couldn't help myself. You must die, Madame. Right away. Please. Please, Monsieur. Let me climb the tower and pray for the salvation of my soul. I can only grant you 15 minutes. Madame, alas, you will not escape death. Anne! My sister Anne, don't you see anything coming? Come on, Madame. You must die. Please. One more minute. That won't accomplish anything. You must die, Madame. A small moment to collect myself. Just for me to concentrate. I don't deserve this sword. It has slit the others' throats. Point your dagger at the treasure in my heart. I will be happy to die by your hand. Please. It's time to die. I don't protest it. I would only want to die holding onto my marriage. When I hadn't upset you, you were so good to me. Alright. But after, I will not tolerate any new request. Promised. Don't cop out at the best part! Shut your mouth! I'm afraid. "My sister Anne, don't you see anything coming? "I see, she replied, two horsemen "are coming from the side, but are still far away. "God be praised. "Those are the musketeers. I'll make signs for them to come faster." Catherine! Marie-Anne! Where is your sister? Was she bad to you again? Mother...
