THE OTHER SHORE A MOVIE BY DOMINIQUE CABRERA -Hello. -Geroges is here. Belkacem, how are you? You bring us all of Oran. -Hey, that guy! -Georges, how are you? Good. So, did you get your visa? It was close! And you, did they threaten you? Are you kidding, I'm here for a check-up. Let's go. I don't want to see her. You can't let them go! You can be a savage sometimes, Georges. He hasn't seen his sister in 30 years and he doesn't want to see her. Do you believe that? Come on in! -How are you? -Salem âlikoum! Fine. Haven't seen you around much lately. How are you? Salem âlikoum. How are you? Come on Georges, please. I won't remember these things when I grow up. I'll remember you. Well, I... -Naked? -No! What a plan! My God... That's Lulu, your niece. Claudine's daughter. -Hello. -A kiss? Yes. Sit down. I don't want to know what became of it. The house, the workshop, Granny's house, the store. What about Dad? You're concerned about that now? He lived well until the end, thanks. Was it hard to bury him with Mom? Why do you think everything is difficult in Algeria? And the graves? Don't worry, they weren't opened, trust me. I don't believe you. You're telling me the graves of the pieds-noirs were not desecrated? Oh, come on! Georges, what matters is that you're here now. Alive! -You're going to stay now, right? -Stay here in France? George, I found someone to buy the cannery from you. You want me to stay? You want me to sell? Are you nuts? You must be happy, you had it all planned 30 years ago. Be quiet! Revenge, right? Thirty years later you can say: "There! "Georges wanted to be clever in '62, 30 years later "he has to admit who was right, is that it?" And you think your Arabs are doing fine without us? What do you think Algeria is? You're the ones who are afraid. I'm very happy in Oran. Saturday, I was at the beach. The sun, traffic jams, girls in two-piece bathing suits. Afterwards we went to eat good fish with my friend Rahmani, we ended the day in Raï nightclub: whiskey and ice at 200 dinars. Ha! Did you ever wonder if I needed you these last 30 years? You can keep your charity! Get out of here now, go! -Please. -You're not done? I want to talk to you about something important. Can you call me tomorrow after the surgery, please? Marinette came to make peace. You don't realize what it means to be here for her. You have a buyer? Who? Come on, tell me. Listen, it's not an olive merchant pied-noir who will teach me about Algeria. Maybe Boualem will? Huh? Boualem, the tax inspector, he came to me, I kicked him out. Is that a joke? Your vultures of the administration have been after me and Montero for 30 years. -Boualem, my ass! -And why do you think the administration got off your case? Why? When the IRS gave you the 500-million dinar adjustment three years ago, what do you think happened? -What? -That's right! I hung around the department crying and bribing everyone for months. -No. -What do you mean? It's me! I made a deal with Boualem. What deal? The IRS is off your ass now, right? I didn't ask you for anything. What deal? The deal was that when Boualem retired, you'd sell him the cannery, the house and the Montero brand. Don't be dumb, Georges! They burned one of your trucks already! You received threats, right? Ah, a burnt truck, threats! You seem to know a lot about that. Do they give you a cut? You want to buy a new bar with your commission? Don't talk to me that way, Georges, I want to help you. If you plant your feet, I'll tell you one thing: go fuck yourself. Fuck off. Listen, Ali. Ali, Ali? Listen. Yes, I'm fine. Come on, let me talk to Ali. I want you to open the shutters on the ground floor every day. Yes, as if I were there and turn on the lights every night. Yes, Ali? Ali? Shit. Lean forward. Rest your chin. Good. Don't move. See now? Dr. Timzert, is that Algerian? When I received your letter from the hospital I thought: "I am in the hands of my compatriot." -You don't understand Arabic? -No. "I'm in the hands of a guy from the sticks." If you want to be treated in Arabic, why didn't you have the surgery in Oran? We had an excellent Algerian colleague here. And he left with your excellent drugs, your excellent nurses, your excellent equipment? Please. Hop on this table. Mr. Montero, Doctor. So, Mr. Montero? Tomorrow morning, you'll see Paris like you haven't seen Oran for a long time. Did you at least have a good night? I couldn't sleep. Don't worry, we treat 15 cataracts a day here. Let's get started. Funny, you don't have an accent at all for a pied-noir. Phaco, please. Look down. Good, don't move. Almost done. -I can't breathe. -We're done. Easy. Easy, easy. Don't worry. I'm here. Hold my hand. You're fine. Easy. Breathe. That's it. What happened? It's OK, Mr. Montero, you just fainted. Ali, Ali? And no one came? Well, listen. Ali, if anything happens, go to Commander Lazreg. At the station, Ali. If you go out with the truck, lock everything up, OK? Hello, Ali, Ali? I'll see you later, Mr. Nivot. How are you, Mr. Montero? Doctor, I didn't think it was possible. A real miracle. You gave us a scare yesterday. Yes, I don't know what's in your products. Perfect. We rarely have accidents under local anesthesia. -So, are you happy? -Of course! What do you see? I've changed a bit, young man. Montero? -What are you doing here, Boualem? -I came from Oran for this. Let's go eat together, on me. Let's talk, we have to fix this problem. You problem is with Belka, not me, so leave me alone. You have to respect our deal. I didn't ask you for a commission. It's not fair. I was straight. I'm not like the others. Are you OK, Mr. Montero? I'm fine. I'm exhausted. My car's nearby, let's get you a room. Come on, I don't mind, but I'm in a hurry. It's not easy to find rooms this time of the year. We'll check here. They're booked. Let's make it easy, Mr. Montero. You can sleep at my place. There's a couch in my office. Plus, it's my birthday. You're welcome. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you It's not the bank, he's a bailiff, Tarek. 100,000 bucks, is it ophthalmic equipment? Is it the car? Wait, you took out another loan? Yes, I took out another loan, so what? Damn it, Liza. Yeah, but 300,000 bucks? What have you done? Forget it, I already took care of it. They just don't know I've already renegotiated. You already at that point? Yes, I just took an advance for the project. -Wait. -I'll work all summer at the American hospital. Come on. You're annoying, Tarek. You live in your own world. Do you live in your own world, Tarek Timzert? "You leave me alone with Félix, "and you leave. "So who do I live with?" Do you love me? Because I do. "We're from the same town." It's funny, all Algerians say that. You don't like it? -It's warm. -Frankly, it pisses me off. They always have to exaggerate. "You're my cousin, you're my brother." What kills me is for a pied-noir to tell me. Tarek. You metropolitans you seem to be chilling people out. Fucking "metropolitans"? What's this? 1962? Do you know how my grandfather died in 1910? They were fishermen. There were 12 of them on a boat. They sank. Arabs, Spaniards, Maltese. My grandmother was left alone with six kids on her hands in the shipping district. So what? My mother arrived alone in the hold of a ship. They didn't sink, don't worry. But they weren't given an olive field. Do you think my dad stole his land? I don't know, it belonged to someone before him. Before 1840. Land is what we make of it. My father worked hard for it. What do you think Algeria was like? A terrace with anisette? There was nothing. Swamps. He made something of it. I've always worked hard, too. You think you're the only one? Stop it, Tarek, you're being rude. He's not, we're just talking. Would like a pastis, Mr. Montero? I could use one. You're too French to understand. -I'm too French? -Yes. I'm too French? When I went to city hall to get my French papers, there was a bonus question. And the chick behind the counter checked off: "Speaks decent French." I freaked out and said: "Remove 'decent'! "I speak French, period. I was born in France!" Did I offend him? No, don't mind him, it's good for him. Are you comfortable downstairs? -I slept well. -You can stay if you want. -Oran. -Djaffar. I'm really glad to see you. You haven't changed. This is nice. Parisian life is good for you. Sit down. Say, can you get this for Tuesday? -It's a lot? -I'm getting a press, and a bottling line. You're not selling your cannery to my brother-in-law anymore? News travels fast here. Georges, you're not scared of Boualem? I've had this creep at home for a week. My father got Boualem into the IRS. If I don't sell, he can make me shut down the cannery. Georges, you can't give in to these people. That's what has been undermining Algeria for 30 years. And you're married to his sister. -His sister's not him. -I'd hope so. What will become of me? I have the choice of having my throat cut in Oran or starving in Paris. You're a real Algerian then. You're giving me a visa to Australia? Djaffar, please tell him to stop bothering me because... I have to run... Good evening, Mr. Montero. Boualem. We're not here to make trouble. I already told you I won't sell! I've told you ten times! You think I'm going to kill myself and end up as a tax inspector for 15,000 dinars a month? If I hadn't set you up, how would you have paid your taxes? Leave my kid! -Let him go! -Leave my kid! What's going on, Georges? How much have you earned in 12 years with your olives? -Tell me how much. -Tell me your taxes weren't theft, huh? Tell me it wasn't extortion, bastard? No, Tarek, stay here! Call the cops! No, wait. Do I call the cops, Georges? -Do I call the cops? -No, it's OK. Ouallah ya, Mr. Montero, what do you want out of this? If you go back to Oran, you could be killed tomorrow. No Algerian will help you like I did. Curse your mother! Stop! Don't touch that, it costs a fortune in Paris! Put it down! James! Stop! Georges, I've been very helpful to you, I've been patient. You have one week, and then, I don't know what to do. Goodnight. -Tarek, are you OK? -Yeah, leave me be. Fuck Georges, who are those guys? I'm sorry, Liza. I don't accept your apologies! You're pissing me off! -Shut up, Liza, fuck! -You piss me off, too! -Did he hurt you? -No, hardly. Bastard! Come on, son. -Is Belka here? -He's on his way. Would you like something to drink? A beer. Are you all right brother? You're OK? My brother,... They killed my brother yesterday because he was a cop. Why? Why? Tell me why? Why? Belka? Belka? -You're back. -Yes. Boualem came by. He'll be back the day after tomorrow for an answer. That's great. As you wish. Your family called too, Lucette, your niece, is looking for you. Right. Why don't you tell them all to come together? That way they can settle my account. It's reassuring to see how you take care of me. Can't you thank me? Georges. -Hi. -How are you? It's good to see you. I'll get your room ready. He leaves, he comes back and you get his room ready? -He thinks he's at home here? -Why not? Well. -We have to meet with Si Mansour. -Don't mess with me. You can get a meeting. But Si Mansour shits on your olives. -Really? -Yeah! He negotiates the Algerian army's radars with the Americans and you want them to handle Montero? You're nothing, razga! It's your fault I'm here. Right? What is it? Shit. Oh, shit! Claire, my granddaughter. -Hello. -Hello. My daughter's daughter. Did you know I had a daughter? One, yes. -Are you married? -No. I'd like you to meet a gentleman I haven't seen in 30 years. -You look good. -Yeah. How are you? I went shopping, -will you eat with us? -Yes. He's tired. When we got out on July 5th, you couldn't walk without stepping on a corpse. We took the plane as we were. We didn't even lock the door to the apartment. And I never saw Georges again. But we stayed at first. He stayed in Relizane alone at the farm, I was in Oran with my father. We kissed, we went to the beach. There was no one left to say: "The Roger girl was seen with the Montero boy." You won't believe me, but we didn't do anything. We could have, but we didn't. He'd walk me to my father's house, he respected me. I wonder if he recognized me earlier, I didn't recognize him at first. I remained stupid. -Did she leave? -Yes. You didn't even kiss me. We kissed so much back then. Do you think I've aged? Ah, shit! It makes me dizzy. I shouldn't have come, it ruins everything. Georges? That's bullshit. We'll regret it. Maria? Maria? Your voice hasn't changed, if you must know. -How are you? -Very good. What about you? I'll take care of you. Félix, go to bed. We're watching the Channel Tunnel. He'll watch it tomorrow. It's past 11. I want to sleep with Dad. Goodnight, sweetheart. See you tomorrow. I need to understand, Tarek. How could you spend all that money on this stuff? -Will you leave me alone? -What is it? Stop! Sorry. Stop! You'll wake up our son, stop! -Stop. -OK, I'll stop. Are you stupid? Will you stop? These banks are like you. They give credit with their eyes closed. Why are you talking to me like this? You don't see anything, Liza. The equipment, the practice, the car, the clothes, the holidays, all that crap. Sometimes I want to kill myself to make it stop. I thought: "Tarek, damn it, stop. All that money going down the drain, "it has to stop." It didn't mean anything anymore. I was disgusted with myself, you know? No, I don't understand. -What about me and Felix? -Are you stupid? Stop talking to me like that. -You didn't know? -No. You don't love me then. It's been all I can think about for months. If you loved me, you'd have felt it. We live together, you felt nothing? How could I have known? You should've felt it, Liza. That's what I mean. You would've if you loved me. You don't love me. No, I don't. I don't love you. See? You can't stand the truth, can you? That's right, leave. We don't care about the money. We'll find more. Shut up! I spent it! Don't take that away from me. Save what? My shitty life as a respected ophthalmologist. Like: "He's Arab, but he's good." Isn't that what you wanted? I don't know what the hell I wanted! What if I lose 300,000 bucks, is it not clear enough for you? You don't need to be a psychoanalyst, think a little. Don't start this again. -Listen, Tarek... -Don't touch me. You see, I love wasting my money. I'm not going to start counting. And you can never make me, you got that? It's over. This life is over. It's over, Tarek. What do you want? Montero's not here. I wanted to talk to you. Speak. Speak, brother. Come in. James got carried away. I'm sorry. Good, excellent. Make yourself at home, we're from the same town, right? So? Is that enough for the equipment, Doctor? Are you kidding me? Get out of here before I get upset. I'm from the hood, not Saint-Germain. Get out of here before I fuck you up. Where do you think I'm from? I was barefoot at school. Living in an HLM was a dream. I got my first shoes when I did my military service. Now, I'm a civil servant. But at the IRS, my bosses are lining their pockets with millions. I'm risking jail time without a cent because I'm nothing. I want to be my own boss now. I like Montero. I was there when he needed help. But he's harsh on me. He has to return the favor. I need it, what do you want me to say? Come on, take it. I'm in enough trouble as it is. Take it. Thank you. To cum and to enjoy That's what matters To cum and to enjoy These are our wishes Let's go, friends, no matter how Let's go, let's go It is the pleasure of the gods Let's go, friends However you do it How do you clean the dead? We wrap them up in a sheet. -I don't know the word. -Kfen? That's it. Yatek saha! Same thing. -How do they do it? -Same. That's it. -Same idea. -Same. Everything's there? When you're under, you're under. Can you get by in Oran? If you have money. It's easy with money. But it's harder than here, huh? -You need to be tough. -No. -Pascal! -It depends. I don't worry about my looks. No, they wrote: Georges Montero in Oran. It's normal. Oil factory! Olive oil factory! -Montero oil. -Tell me, Georges, what about the Parisian girls? -Any luck? -Yeah. Are you popular? Oh, my niece, Lucette. -Nice to meet you. -Hello, gentlemen. -You didn't call. -No. Come sit down. Shall we finish later? Yes. We'll be here. We didn't lose. I won't pay. We'll continue later, it's OK. Later, yes. No problem, we'll continue. So your mom's mad at me for staying? We don't talk about it. Never. I didn't know I had an uncle. She talks about your brother who was walled up. She thinks she sees him in her dreams, she thinks he'll come back. We can't get her to understand that he's dead. Why do you say walled up? The family says he was walled up in '62 in the farm. What's that nonsense? René wasn't walled up. He was killed in an ambush, I found out in '72. How could they believe such a thing? You have to tell them. Mom's been depressed for years. She got worse when she heard we came to see you with Marinette. You have to tell her what happened to René. You know I don't have much time left, right? So I want to do things I like with people I like, got it? Do you know why I stayed in Oran? Because I like it there, that's all. I never wanted to move. Just the thought of going back gives me a hard-on. Here, my address. When things get better, bring your kids. No. I've been dealing with her for years. Marinette too. A mother like that is a lot to deal with. And you give me your address in Oran. I don't give a shit. You can't just walk away, you have to see her. Oh, Tarek. This is the surgeon who operated on me. -Hello. -Dr. Timzert, ma niece, Lucette. -Hello. -Hello. What are you doing here? Sit down. I was worried. You didn't come to the post-operative check-up. Let me see. This is no joke. How's it holding up? I don't even think about it anymore. How are you? Not great. I'm a little tired right now. I'm disgusted, Georges. Every slaughterhouse here is a fortress. Between the Algerians, the Moroccans, it's a war for monopoly. Come this way. They fight for this. They have no shame. For them, there's only money, they have forgotten Islam. No, not that one. This one. There's better this way. I saw a movie on TV about the slaughterhouses in Marseille, they have a tape recorder that plays Fatiha continuously: "bismilleh, bismilleh" over and over. Are you a Muslim? According to my wife, I'm circumcised. Don't play with that. Where are you from? -My father was from Draâ El Mizen. -Draâ El Mizen. That's great my son! You know, I'm Kabyle too, but from Oran. Come here, Georges. 50,000 is really all I can do, Georges. You're only giving them a deposit anyway, right? That'll be fine. But tell me, have you spoken to Boualem? I don't see a solution to that, Georges. Since he has Si Mansour's support, he feels like he has wings. Right now, he only respects money. I need an Algerian partner. Yes, of course, but who? Huh? Oh! Ah, Georges! You know you belong in Oran. If you could be a Muslim, we'd really be brothers. Come on. It feels good, doesn't it? That's a successful Arab. Give me a break with Arabs. What the hell are you talking about? I'm from La Garenne. What are you complaining about? Oh! 4x4, doc. Move along. Are you proud of yourself? Can I borrow your car? I have to go down to south tomorrow to buy some equipment. -When? -Tomorrow, do you want to come? Why wouldn't you? Have you ever seen an olive grove? An oil mill? No, I've never seen either. -Does it hurt? -Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Antoine, are you done? Go wash your hands. Feeling better, Doctor? Taking a step back? Yes. My old man didn't loosen up. We ate separately. Not a word for years. He never told me about his roots, his origins. The town, any of it. He simply never told me about it. Then people ask: "You don't speak Arabic"? What is Arabic? He didn't say a word. Yes, sometimes he asked me when a guy from the government would come. Anyone, the mailman, the EDF guy for the meter. He'd get everything out: rent receipt, residence permit, pay slip, and he'd say: "wourilou koulchi." I'm in order, Tarek. "Dir medjoudek." "Medjoudek." Do your best. "Ya oulidi ya el aziz." My darling son. He died, may he rest in peace, the year I graduated. Did you bury him in Algeria? No, it happened very quickly. He died at the hospital in Clermont at 4 p.m. and I didn't know what to do. When we got to the apartment, there were a bunch of women I'd never seen, I didn't know where they came from. Fifty women in an apartment elevator. They screamed, bawled, cried. I didn't know where I was. They were mourning my father. And I didn't know how to bury a Muslim. A guy from the municipal gardens cleaned him up. I remember telling him: "How will you do it? There's no bathtub here." He said: "You don't belong here." A guy I didn't know. A gardener. The neighbors took care of the shroud. They did everything, the meal of the dead. The grave was dug by kids from the city. I mean, I was nothing in that. "Eldjar," the neighbor. He'll never let you down. Sometimes he pisses you off because he's always there. But he's there. That's what a neighborhood is. Eldjar the neighbor and el gaouri, the stranger, the Frenchman. I'm the "el gaouri", the outsider. and the pied-noir of the neighborhood. "Eldjar", the neighbor. And outsider for life. So we're all outsiders? There it is! That's the one we want to sell. The beast. The cost is 70,000 francs. That's half the price. -Half price, it's cheap. -Seven million? No, one third. Come on. It'll still run like new in 10 years. I might as well buy a new one then. Such nice equipment... It is, I agree. But do you realize the cost of shipping it to Algeria? It's not my fault you live in Algeria. No, I won't bargain. We told you 70,000 francs on the phone, so it's 70,000 francs. I'll offer you 5 million, that's all I've got, I'm not a billionaire. If you want, I can promise you a deposit in cash. That's something. All right. Did you count how many cases we have so far? -We haven't. -Are you going to? Start by lifting it. We have lots of grossanes over there. -Black olives? -Yes. They're used for confectionery. Have you ever hit your head with a rock? No! Do we pick them up? -Where are you going? -At the stadium in Aureille. -Is it far? -No. -We missed the bus. -So? -We're late. -Walk, it's good practice. Be nice, take us. You have room. We're really late. -What kind of stadium is it? -Soccer. Hop in. Put the bags in the trunk. What position do you play? -Right winger. -Center forward. Center back. I was center forward, too. -In Algeria? -Yes. I was a left winger, even though I was right-footed. You stayed in your position? No, I liked to head the ball in mid-field. Wingers who move around is just annoying. Come on, run. Do you see your brothers? My younger brothers, yes. My sister, much less. I haven't seen my sister Claudine in 30 years, can you believe it? Can you? I have to see them. -Will you come with me? -Me? Yeah. I'm supposed to go back to work on Monday. If I go back to Oran without talking to them, I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life. You're not sure to return to Oran? No. No, I'm not. OK. It's all automatic. Excuse me, Gérard, but my room is much nicer than this one. You don't know what you're talking about. Do you think he would've told me: "Thank you, daughter, "thanks to God, you stay with us." We were at war, you forget that. If it was your country, you should've fought harder! Do you hear her, Georges? That's France. You did well to stay in Algeria. They can only talk here. I made some noise: "French Algeria!" "French Algeria!" And when it got serious, the pieds-noirs with their OAS were no match. It wasn't the political parties from here. We ended up in Orly, one hand in front, one hand behind. -"French Algeria!" -Stop feeding these kids peanuts. "French Algeria!" "French Algeria!" -It'll spoil their appetite. -You're pissing me off! Don't talk to me like that. Come on, Claudine, take that off. Breathe a little. Let me see. Look at mine. It's darker. This country has no smell. -Are you OK? -Kids! I'm fine. Kids, go wash your hands. Look at your sister. Lulu doesn't understand. She mixes everything with politics. She's the spitting image of you at her age. Hey! I'll go start the rice! It's too acidic. I don't need anything else now. Mom, please, not today. Don't do this again, please. Claudine, come help me. Come on. Thanks, honey. Here. Claudine, I'm going home, in Oran. I just came in to get my eyes done. I have work to do at home. Georges, please. If you go back there, we won't see you again. -They'll kill you. -Come on. Like they killed Uncle Bénitette, and Bruno. Stéphane, Marcel, and René. Was his body found? -Settle down. -Did you see him, Georgeot? -Did you see him? -No. I didn't see his body, but I know how it happened. -Can you hear it? -Yes. -Tell me the truth. -Yes. First of all, he's not the one who was walled up, René Garcia was. A big guy. In his pharmacy in Mascara. Listen, ours was killed on the road to Mostaganem, in an ambush. The Fellaghas killed them and buried them in a ditch. Monsef, the nurse, told me in 1972. He said he'd recognized René's body. He was sure of it. That's it. It's all over. Come on now, come on. Come on! Mr. Tarek? Please. Georges? Enough, enough. Claudine, sweetheart? Come on. Come on, just a bit. Pass me the children's plates. I'm not going back to Belka. Just drop me off at a cab. I have someone to see. Shit, watch out! How can you live here? Listen, I haven't slept since you've been here. What's the matter, do I bother you? Do I make you nervous? No, not here. Let's go to my room. Come on, stop it. Leave me! You're not interested in me! -Are you interested in me? -Yes. Yes, but not like that. Ah! Would you come to my house? Would you change your life for me? You're pissing me off, Georges Montero. You won't make me say we can't live in Algeria. On vacation? With mineral water in your suitcase? Not on holiday either! "I never imagined it would change so much!" "I remembered it bigger, but smaller, too." "My God it's so dirty!" "How can you...?" "It saddens me so much." Yes, of course. Nostalgia. Life is not a vacation. It's not mineral water in a suitcase, you have to drink the neighborhood's water! You have to have colic with these towel-heads, right? No way! How did it happen? Six, two. We heard it on the radio at 4 p.m. If you have more details, please call us. They killed him in Gambetta, near his neighborhood. Three kids drove by and shot him. Those fuckers, on the back. He was going to see his mother. What a tragedy. Why, my lord, why? Are there any witnesses? Do we know who it was? No, nothing. They suspect some guys in the neighborhood. Omar, -Turn on the TV. -OK. They even kill singers now. Can't he mind his own business? -Do you know Hasni to talk? -Yeah, I know Hasni. So? Cheb Hasni, 26, was killed in Oran. He was considered a rising star of raï, a music that literally revolts the fundamentalists. A report by Véronique Taveau. His songs were about love and freedom, he sang raï, the typical music of Oran, with simple words, lyrics mixing Arabic and French. Cheb Hasni was killed in front of his home in Oran, shot twice in the head. He was 26 years old. For Khaled, the other great raï singer, it's a friend who was just killed, a dire loss for Algeria. I'm really sad. I lost a friend. These people want to destabilize the country, they want people to revolt and there will be a civil war. We have a beautiful country and we have to stop the killings. Cheb Hasni's name has been added to the already long list of intellectuals and artists murdered in Algeria. One of his very last songs was about hope. I was there at the concert. At the Palais des Sports. Even in Oran, he should've been protected! What world do we live in? Hey, the Spaniard, what do you care? Mind your own business old man. -Go back to Alicante. -Get the fuck out. Hey. I got here in the hold of a boat, OK? -So did my mother. -Your mother can go fuck herself. Oh! Oh! Let go of me! You protect a Frenchman? You made a mess in the neighborhood and you want to fuck with us here? I don't even like to fight. Why did you provoke them, huh? I provoked them? Yes, if something bothers you, talk to me. I'm the fucking boss! I didn't provoke them, what are you talking about? Enough. Enough. You can't leave now. -I'll just go home. -Come on, Tarek. -Ah, too bad. -You can't stand up, come on. Go with her. That's what Algeria is like. It only attacks people who are doing good things. Why are we doing everything we can to screw up this country? Unbelievable, it has to get better. -The further we go. -The darker it gets. Fuck. It's over, Belka, it's over. The workshop, the house. Give it all to Boualem. I've had it, I don't want to hear about Algeria anymore. Be quiet, Georges. Please sit down, don't talk nonsense. Listen, we got a meeting with Si Mansour. We sacrificed you... Your best songs are gone They're lost without you Exile is hard and full of unknowns... Belka, between you and I, what did Boualem give you? I did it for you, Georges. They IRS was after you, you were running around, getting nowhere. Come on, tell me. He helped me get 100 million out in foreign currency through Si Mansour. A hundred million? You could have told me. Instead of acting like you had nothing to do with it. It was me who wanted us to buy a business in Paris. I'm telling you the truth, for my children. Yup. He told me: "I'll get your money in France and you set me up with Montero." This is not a betrayal, George. It was a win-win situation. And the country was going to hell, and I was sure you'd drop it eventually. What do you want me to do? Leave my money over there? Wait here with my wife and kids? You tell me, Georges. Hi Mr. Montero. I've wanted to meet you for a long time. Me too, Si Mansour. Nice to meet you. I've always had a lot of admiration for our pieds-noir -who speak Arabic. -Thank you. Follow me. I have something to show you. I can't, no. Listen, Georges, we can talk. I know it was a mistake. I apologize, Mr. Montero. I didn't want to break anything at the doctor's. I paid him back. Trust me, it's very painful for me to have to deal with this misunderstanding. This deal was made three years ago. And Boualem hasn't been able to get along with you. It's pathetic of him, Mr. Montero. I made no deals with him. There it is, Mr. Montero. You're opening the door to violence. Are you aware of my situation? Quite, Si Mansour. People can't get along and they all come crying to me. Do I have the power to solve all of Algeria's problems? I did a study: "Prospects for the development of Montero." Montero, prospects? He'll sink the business within three months! -Give me a chance, Montero. -Where are you from, Boualem? You told me, but I forgot. I'm from Oued Rhiou . Prospects? Don't use such big words. See, Boualem has remained a farmer, which is good. How I would have loved to have cake and milk under an olive tree. Not all that shit. Let your business go. A deal is a deal. Otherwise, where would our country go? Starting today, I'm not talking to you anymore. Cancel everything. If I sign, it will be by his hand, not mine. What does he have on you, huh? Do you think I'm stupid? He said: "50% of Montero and you sign." I can't do it, it's too much. -Are you complaining to us? -We're free men. We can find a solution. I didn't want it to be like this, Montero. I wanted it to be a family affair. I've been waiting for you for three days, Tarek. What do I tell Félix? What are you doing with this guy, Tarek? Something weird happened to me. At the "La Sénia" bar, I slept in one room with ten other people. That's something I hated as a kid. Ten aunts and uncles showing up in a room where we used to sleep at four. And until 22, until college, I slept with my brothers and sisters and I dreamed of having a place of my own, my own office, to be quiet and be alone. Especially alone. What happened in Barbès shocked me. I was really happy, Liza. Feelings the others, talking. There were ten of us in the living room and I felt good. Really good. I realized that my journey was hard, Liza. I lost some luggage on the way. So, Georges, what does the prophet propose? Do you realize? Over there, he gets cheated by civil servants he's put down by the fundamentalists! Stop, you're pissing me off! Did you invite me over to insult me? Belka doesn't like my new partners. Can we continue, Djaffar? First of all, Boualem, I'm glad you left Si Mansour. Now we'll talk about the Montero company as a family. Between us. Between Oranese. Your turn, Georges. Well, I recognize that I'm tied to you through Belka's word, and that we need to get along. That's a good start. My brother-in-law, Boualem, is giving up the canning business. But we partner up, OK? You're beautiful, lovely! Stay at the bar, don't go out, OK? -There's no respect here. -You talk about respect? If you want to be respected, respect others, OK? -Pathetic. -You're right, fight back. Raise your daughter as you like, but she can't talk to me that way! She's at home, she does what she wants. OK, we're leaving. Don't touch me, you're drunk. Stop. Relax! Take the wine away. He comes to us and commands us. Here. Bring it to the bar. Do it for Georges. It's my fault. Sorry, Georges. Be careful. Where were we? George, I need collateral for the banks. He puts 2 million in the deal, and we'll sell Montero oil all over the Maghreb. You made a deal with a fascist. Belka, you're pushing it. Fascist, come on. That one! He's not a fascist? Go ahead, you're walking through the bar of sins. Come on, cover your ears. Cover your eyes, there are women. I didn't get to my age to be afraid to die. And at least, I'll be buried at home, in peace. Oh! He has money! He's protecting a Frenchman! We told you we'd be back! Fucking Spaniard! Infidel! Unbeliever! Stop! We'll be back for the big cleanup! Calm down, it's OK, Georges. It's nothing. Go back inside. It's nothing, it's nothing. What about you? Will you go back to Oran? -I don't know. -You'd work with these assholes? The little shits. Some jerk will shoot you on a street corner and you're happy. Go. Leave him. You don't even know what you're doing. Hello, Ali? Yes. It's me. How are you? You're sleeping? Listen, I'm going home this week. No, there's no problem. I just have to get a plane ticket. No, it's OK. Goodbye. We can't stay here. We can't continue like this. I can't. Do you have someone? Are you taken? Are you taken? Yes.
