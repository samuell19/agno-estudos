Pa, what should I do now? Keep watch, watch out for bad weather Warn us if you see anything Pa, how do I know if a storm is coming? You'll know if a storm is coming through observation Learn to observe your environment: the sea, the waves Watch the wind on the horizon, where it is taking the clouds Watch closely But if you can't escape a storm, Don't be scared, and don't fight it Be careful not to lose your strength Look for something to hold onto and wait until the storm passes you by It's the same in life If you find yourself in a bad circumstances and you feel lost You must find something to hold onto For us, we have our spears We hold tight to them because they provide for us As long as we have them, we can eat and we will survive the storms Hey Gary, catch anything? That's ok, I got a good one, we can share it Pa, why is mu skin not as dark as the other boys? It's because your mother was not of our tribe Her tribe is called 'Talaandig' Where is my mother now?

Here is a picture of your mother I hid Keep it safe She is from a valley called San Fernando I must help rescue the boats You go into the city and wait for me there Run! What are you doing here?

Yes, most of the homes burned down, including mine That's crazy man... so unlucky This is where I come when I need to get away and think about things The view and the fresh air... they help me think Where are you living now, a camp?

More conflicts in the mountains of Bukidnon have left many dead in recent weeks Both the military and various rebel groups have incurred losses in recent ambush attacks The rebel groups are fighting against what they believe to be unfair mining and foresty projects sanctioned by the Government within tribal territories However, without proper Government representation or land titles They believe they must resort to violence To uphold their claims Many tribal peoples, otherwise known as 'Lumads' are being caught in the crossfire Finding themselves displaced or incurring losses of their own while trying to remain a neutral party The rebels have released several propaganda videos on the internet Saying they are stronger than ever While experts believe their numbers are dwindling and thus are heavily recruiting in cities and in villages in Bukidnon province Offering food, pay and protection to those who join their cause What idiots, getting themselves killed in ambushes What do you know about it? Gary, let's go! One sec, be right there I need you to hide so the landlady doesn't see you Nack Nack, you're late on your rent! Hello! Good day! Hold on Is there a problem Nack?

You're crazy if you want to come with me, stay here! Stay here, you're not coming! I want to come, let me come! 'Climb every mountain!' Why are you so slow? Move! I've never been in a forest before I've never seen so many trees Why do you have so many tattoos? These? They tell mey story to the world They're like symbols of my identity Like this one, of Mother Mary I got this tattoo, because I never knew my own mother When I look at her face, I feel like I have a mother watching out for me and this one, this one is a symbol of the group I belong to 'Souljah's Ryhme' We love music, singing and dancing What about you? Why don't you have a tattoo? I don't know what to get Get something that tells your story... Your identity Or maybe, just get a tattoo of the face of your mama I can't think of anything Maybe we could get one together? Like what? I don't know 'Friends' Are you kidding me? That's too gay! How about... 'Expendable' Yeah, like the movies... maybe here Get up Where are you from? Get up! You're MPF right? We came to join up with you Nack, who are these guys?

Do you want the military to smell us? Yeah right, how could they find us? How do you think we found you? Let's go! Intruders - we found them wandering Why were you wandering in the jungle? We came to join up, we had nowhere else to go Is this true? Come Tonight we have some guests with us They are young But it is important for young people to join our group If you are old, you are already a victim of the system But if you are young, you have time to take action, and find the strength to change the system! Tell me Do you know who we are? We are the Mindanao People's Front! Our mission is to protect the homes and identities of the true people of Mindanao, and of the Philippines Tell me Have you ever had something taken from you? Me also That's why we are here Because we have lost so much, like our land, our culture, and our identity! We have lost these things because of capitalsim big business, mining companies, plantation companies that come from America, Japan, Australia, and Canada There's nothing left for us, and there's nowhere to go So we must stand up for ourselves! Show how strong we can be! Do you think what they do is fair? You're right, it's not fair! So let's show them that we want justice! Are you sure you want to be one of us? Are you willing to fight against the ones that take from us, and treat us like slaves? Are you tough enough to be a real warrior? Or are you only here because you want safety and food Ok, I want you to form a line, and march from there to there I'm not going with them I'm a gangster, I want to stay with you guys You call yourself a gangster? Does that mean I should respect you! If you want respect, you have to earn it If everyone just does whatever they want and doesn't take orders we will be weak and useless That's what the government wants They think we are young and disorganized So we must show them that we are disciplined So if you won't march Then you won't eat Hey kid bring me one bowl? I wish I didn't bring you here You should be in the city, playing computer, fishing, having fun I shouldn't have brought you here, I'm sorry... I'ts my fault The revenge wasn't worth it It's not so bad, at least they have food This is how you must carry your weapon, pointed down Here's the site This is the trigger Here's the safety This is the magazine To change the magazine, press here, and it falls and press the new one in You must keep your gun in good condition I want you to send some of the new ones to Baranguay Blacktop That's a risky area We need to show bravery We must be willing to make sacrifices to show we are not afraid Tonight we are gathered to remember, and to celebrate and welcome some new members to our cause and to our family And now... as a symbol of their new life and to show their commitment they will make a sacrifice of a possession that is precious to them Who wants to do the honors? New recruit! Show me who you really are Why did we burn that truck? Because they didn't pay their taxes Where are you from? Just over those hills, a small community Tell me, if you look over there, Do you see many trees? Or not? I don't know Years ago, there were many trees Covering the hills But then the government gave away the land Men cut down the trees and took them away Forests that provided our livelihood The forest was our pharmacy our church, and our market and the wisdom of the old days Where are you from? Bajao tribe, Davao City I live... I used to live on the shore But our village was burned down Do you think it's possible the Government wanted to take your land? I don't know Hey bro, I forgot, I have something for you I saved this for you Her face burned off though, sorry the legs are there though, so it's still good keep it as akeepsake to remember where you came from Don't forget about her Don't forget I'm sending you on a mission to Baranguay Blacktop Ten kilometers from here To collect tax and recruit Now! Nack, can we stop? Keep going, don't be a wuss I think a storm is coming Nack, I thought I saw something move! Do you see anything? Run! Run Gary! Find them! See anything? Nothing Where am I? You're awake? Don't worry Have some coffee with me I grew the beans myself What tribe are you? I am from the Bajao tribe You are far from home! I have to go Where are my clothes? Please wait, just a moment Wear this for now I need to go Please wait, just a moment Out there, that's not your fight You're still young You should be having fun, playing games Helping to plant crops Watching animals I need to go If they find me here They'll call me a coward and a traitor I have to go and tell them what happened Come, I want to show you something Are you happy to be fighting against the government? You should be fighting instead against your true enemy which is your stomach Me? I'm also a warrior But my weapons are my farming tools They give me my strength and also a home, and an identity If you want to be a warrior then follow me to plant crops We, the Talaandig Wait, what tribe did you say? This is a risky idea If the rebels find him here, problems and if the military finds him, even bigger problems He needs our support and if he blends in maybe when they come they won't recognize him Do they dance where you come from? Not really, we are swimmers, not dancers Have you swum in the sea before? Yes, all the time I would love to try it sometime It's good, but you have to be careful of storms I bet you would know what to do Yeah Are you an artist? No, not really... Many here are artist though I like to support them, and fill my house with their work What do you think? They are beautiful Art is an important practice It helps us remember and preserve our culture Come with me I will show you some more We must make use of the skills and traditions that are passed on to us so that can preserveour identity as a tribe those things that have been handed down to us Sometimes we don't see the value of art Right now, many tribes and city dwellers and have forgotten the value of art and with it, their origins But by practicing painting, and also dance, and music It might help others remember the wisdom and the importance of their own culture and that we must work together to protect it Who is this woman That was my niece Many years ago, she left us and I heard she was married in Davao But we haven't heard from her in a long time Where are you from? You're not from this tribe, are you? What's your name? Where are you really from? I should ask you the same thing Who are you and where are you from? I'm of the Manobo tribe We are native warriors Fighting for justice in Mindanao We are the MPF I'm here to recruit You won't find any fighters here You already have one among you We have all taken different paths to get to where we are today But it is our choice what we choose to do now, that determines who we really are Commander Tell me something What are you fighting for exactly? The war for peace in Mindanao and for true justice from the disease of corruption within our government thanks to the meddling Americans You think you will find justice and peace through using weapons? You say you are Manobo You have your own strengths as a tribe Your own practices Your own culture Your ancestral teritories Not capitalism not communism not religion Above all The fight that we must face is to provide food for our people So that we may remain in our lands even when things are hard If our people are hungry they will lose the ability to hold on to their true identites If we don't fight with weapons They will continue to abuse us They don't respect us as tribal people And the next generation can change things, through strength Do you believe that you'll win against them? You are just a pawn This is their business It's not really your choice to fight as a true Filipino For me, it's to late I've lost too much and I have too much anger in my heart Your anger won't save anyone Gary, what will you choose? To go and fight with them? Or remain with our tribe? What if the government tries to burn this place and take the land? How can they burn it? These lands when it is us farmers who produce their food? How can they destroy us If we help each other and if we remain united and strong? Will you go with them? Or stay with the tribe?
