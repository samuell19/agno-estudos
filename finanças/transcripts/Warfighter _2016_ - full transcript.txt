You gotta fight for your brothers on your right and your left so that's... I mean, we had a job to do, so just do our job. No matter what happens, the guy on my left and right is gonna be there no matter what. The White House and western allies struggle to contain ISIS. They include taking over more territory, requiring all Muslims to swear allegiance to the group and to continue waging a chilling propaganda war. The terrorist group has made their presence known in the country, carrying out several gruesome beheadings... Analysts say it's a simple equation. The more videos are produced in English, the more threats are directed at America. Wolfman, things are getting hairy out here. If you don't have it, we need to scram. Over. I'll get it. ETA. Little Mann, have you entered the building? Little Mann, are you in the hallway? Over? Wolf, ETA. Seconds. Little Mann, are you in the hallway, over? Target eliminated. Baby girl. Baby girl. Baby girl. Baby girl. "...said the Good Witch of the North. So Dorothy closed her eyes and tapped the heels together of her ruby red slippers three times. 'There is no place like home, there is no place like home, there is no place like home.' And with a twist of her wand, Dorothy was back home safe in her bed with all her stuffed animals." That's not what it says. It's time for bed, Goose. Will you read Edgar Allen Poe tomorrow? Only if your mommy says it's okay. She's gonna say no. "Well, touch luck," said the woodchuck. I don't say that to you every time Mommy tells you no. Mommy does say no a lot, doesn't she? Hm. Can I have a cool nickname like you? What are you talking about? You got lots of cool nicknames. You got some of the coolest nicknames in the entire world. Kidwit, Munchkin, Pumpkin, Nugget, Angel Blue Eyes. Total lame-o. I want something more like... Wolfgirl, the most awesomest superhero in the village. Wolfgirl. You are so silly. Mommy says she misses your handsome face. Mommy says that? Can I ask you a personal question? Uh-huh. What's a dirty Mexican? Where did you hear that? School. - Who? - Kingston. What did Kingston say? That I was a dirty Mexican. Well, your mom is a Mexican. Oh, we got some dirt on your cheek there. So, yep. You're a dirty Mexican. But now you're a clean Mexican. - I love you daddy. - I love you, too. Eskimos. Daddy... I don't ever want you to go away and never come back home to me and mommy. I won't. Here. This is a magic dragon. It will keep you safe. - All right? - Thank you, Daddy. All right, Speedy Gonzales. Brush. I brush my teeth for a second time to keep myself from falling asleep. - I'm brushing. - Uh-huh. Is there any word on if you're heading out this week? I don't know. Hey, you know what Olivia asked me? - Hm? - What is a dirty Mexican. Kingston. Can't we wait to have this conversation until after? I think I have some unfinished business with you. - Hm. - Uh-huh. That's affirmative, Lieutenant. I like that. Did you close Olivia's door? No. Can't we just keep it open? All right. - All right, I'll be right back. - Go. - Yeah, one second. - Mm. Ah... Put your tongue outside so I can check you out a little bit. Starship, this is Wolfman. I am in position. I have located the package and got eyes on all landmarks down range. This is Starship.

All right? Listen to my voice. It's me. It's your wife. Baby. Lieutenant! At ease, sailor! Where are we? You're at home now. With me. Vanessa. I know who you are. You were just having a nightmare, baby. Where were you? In the jungle. And who were your teammates? Uh... Scorpion. Lucas? Lucas is fine. Who else was there? Starship. Uh... Buckeye. Starship and Buckeye are not real. Who else was in your dream? Skid Row. Nope. They're not real. None of them. I know them so well. Only in your head. Rusty, you're just having some war trauma. The white snake. White snake? So, you were in Nicaragua. Yeah. Yeah, Nicaragua. We were all there. We died. Lucas... No. Your mission was successful. Baby, baby, I need you to breathe, okay? Listen to me. You all made it. Lieutenant Pope... and Little Mann, Rooster, Casper, Sunny. Lucas called you yesterday. I mean, baby, look at your phone. Is Daddy okay? Yes, sweetie. Daddy was just having a nightmare, okay? Go back to bed. I'll be there in a second. Okay. I love you, Daddy. Check your messages. Wolfy! Hey, Rust, sorry I forgot to call you yesterday. Me and baby girl took the boat out sailing and we just ended up hanging out at sea and I couldn't get back with you. No cell service, dude. But if you're free later today, hey, let's grab a quick beer, or we'll roll together at the twins' party. Love to Vanessa and Little Blue Eyes, man. Slayers out! See? I need to call him. Rust? Lucas. Rusty! - Hey, man, how are you doing? - Dude... I'm doing all right, man. I'm sleeping. How are you doing, bro? I'm doing pretty good. I just wanted to know if you're going to the twins' party tomorrow. Yeah, man. We'll definitely be there. Definitely. - Cool, man. - Hey. You doing okay? Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to check in on you, bud. Got you. All right. All right. Is Vanessa with you? Uh-huh. Hey, you got me on speakerphone? Uh-huh. - Hey, Vanessa. - Hey, Lucas.

You all made it. What about the little girl with the blonde hair? I don't know who she is. Baby. Baby. Yeah. Come here. - I'm sorry. - No, baby. Don't be sorry. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Shh! Baby, why don't you go get some fresh air, okay? I'm gonna put Olivia to bed. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I hate you. Hey, kiddo. Hey. We got Pandy, huh? - Yeah. - How's Pandy doing? He's doing good. Yeah? How are you doing, Pandy? "Oh, you know, I just like to get tickled." - Do it. Tickle him. - Tickle Pandy? Here you go. Tickle Pandy. I'll fix it. I don't think it's broken. It's down, huh? Nightmare? Yeah. How bad? A level 10. Monster in it? What color? Green. I'm sorry. You know what I do when I have a nightmare with a monster in it? Hey, I told you just a quick kiss and a hug. Get your butt back in bed. I'll see you, girl. I love you. I love you more. Hey, get some rest, right? Okay. Bye. Bye, Mom. Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. Let's go to bed. I'll be there in a minute. Okay. Daddy, will you please say something for little Hammy? Uh, yeah, okay. Um... Dear... Dear Lord, thank you for giving us Hammy. It was quite a champion. Uh, lived a good life. Bless your soul, Hammy. Thank you. Amen. It's okay, Daddy. You can cry. Hm. Yeah. Sometimes adults cry. Is Heaven different for everyone? Yeah, I think so. What about our souls? Do all souls go to Heaven? I believe so. Do you think sometimes souls get lost between here and Heaven? I think sometimes souls stay behind to watch over us and make sure that we're okay. You're talking about little Hammy? Papa? Olivia, I need you to get in the car right now, young lady. Rusty, you didn't fix the light. Is Daddy in trouble? He was with me and Hammy. He's going to be if you guys don't get your butts in this car right now. Thank you, young lady. Lieutenant James Rusty Wittenburg. The light. You have until the count of three. I'm calling Eric. Excuse me. Oh, come on. He's a professional electrician. He's a professional electrician that wants to... St... Yeah, Eric is an electrician that wants to take Daddy's place. - High school sweetheart. - Stop. He would love to be back in the picture. That's ridiculous. Just give me one more week and I'll fix it, honest to God. It's become a personal thing for me. - One week. - Hm. - One. - One week. I'm giving you until next Saturday, but if I see that light flicker one more time, I don't care, it doesn't have to be Eric but we need to hire a professional electrician who knows how to handle fixing a short. I can fix a short. One week. There's something wacky with the wiring. I can do it. There's the wolf pack. Hi, Casper. Hey there, little buddy. - Hi. - Where you been? At the grade, working on science project. Uh-huh. Well, I'm just here to drop off presents. Becky's BFF's getting married, and she's a bridesmaid. I have no choice in the matter, so I'll be leading her on from the sidelines. Well, you're a sweetheart. This one probably would have left me hanging. Hey. We are up a home. Uh-huh. Hey, Little Slugger. Hi, Uncle Little Mann. Bye, Uncle Little Mann. Hm. I wonder which one of you she takes after. Oh. Here, hold him. He's sleeping. What a face. He's 15 pounds already. You ain't kidding. - They grow like a weed. - Shh! Unfortunately, we're not gonna be able to stay long. I'm sorry. Young wife's the boss. Hi baby, come here. I promised I'd work in the kitchen. I think she likes me. I think she does. Oh, my mother. I'm so sorry. Ah, Vanessa, you look like a Spanish rose in bloom in Texas and... A baby! It's a baby. Oh, come on. We gotta show everyone. Oh, look at you. - And you're wearing heels, too. - I know, she's amazing, huh? How skinny you are already. Oh, my God. That is unfair. - Hi, Uncle Rusty. - Hi, girls. Say cheese to our new spy cam recorder. Uh, happy birthday, Ash. Happy birthday, Renee. Our dad got it for us. Right on. Say something cool. How's the party? That's lame. Show him. No. Did you know this thing has, like, a million pixels and has a panoramic view? Right on. All right, we'll show you, but you've gotta promise you don't tell our dad. Scout's honor. She filmed it. I'm gonna sell it for distribution on line. It's Rooster. - Hey, you know what... - You promised! Wolf, wolf, wolf. Wolfman. Slash. Look's good. - Hey, daddio. - What's up, Jeff? Hey, can I talk to you real quick? - Yeah. - Cool. What's up? Hey. You solid from last night? Yep. Bad moment. How did I get it this time? Head or chest? Both. You've been having a lot of those lately. Hey. Remember that time back in high school, that Jeffrey Hayden incident? Yeah, you're going way back. That boy. Pick-up game. Two-hand touch football. He cheap shot at me, and you walked over, you picked him up, you slammed him on that fence and broke his arm. I did that? Yeah, you did. You had my back. You were gonna get suspended, but who took the blame? You took the blame. Who's got your back? You've... You've got my back. Nothing has changed. I had your back then. I've got your back now. I think you need to see a professional. I'll make the call next week. You're my best friend, Rusty. One is none, two is one. Now go give LT some love before he overcooks my steak for hogging you. Be right back. - You're such a flirt. - Thank you. I'm not making it well done. It is not American. Yeah, but I'm not gonna have stuff running around the plate over there for people either. It's gonna taste like Cherokee. It's going to be all... Hey. We're almost done with the food. Medium for you and rare for Vanessa? Medium for Vanessa. Okay. And I know Olivia is going through that picky state, so I got her some macaroni. Well, that sounds about right. I'm so glad you are here. Now, if you need anything, you just holler. Momma! What? Girl's got entirely too much energy. - How are you doing, bud? - I'm doing okay, man. - Olivia is looking like her mom. - Yeah. And the twins are taking after their dad. Yeah, they're growing up way too fast, brother. Darla wants another set. Hey, you know that little recorder you got them? She's pregnant. - Darla? - Of course Darla. Who the hell do you think I'm talking about? And she's hoping for another set. Ooh! Well, that'll keep you young. Yeah, I sure hope so. - Anyone else know? - No. Just you. We're gonna wait till after the first trimester. After what happened last time... it didn't go over too well. Yeah, I get you, man. Well, uh... Here's to another set. Yeah. Go in there. Get some snacks. Steak's almost ready. - Cool. - Be right in. Got it. - It was exactly like that. - No, I don't think so. Yes. Yes, it was. Believe me, I know. It was right before we hit Costa Rica, and your dad may have been toast and rosy, but that night after the brawl, that's when he said it, and pardon my French, but the toughest son of a bitch there ever was, even tougher than Top Dog. But he certainly said it. Hm. You guys keep staring at us, huh? We got him. Looks like your boy needs a bailout. My boy could handle himself. Wise man. I'm getting another. You want one, young lady? Dad, you've had enough, okay? - Um, I would love one. - Got it. Your dad's a gentleman. I need you to stop that. It's my property, dick weed. I apologize. I'm married, as you can see. That thing don't mean shit. What the fuck are you doing in a place like this? It does to me. To us it don't. You know, I... Uh-huh. Now you've done it. Do you know who I am? No, I've never seen you in my life. I'm fucking Deacon. No, never heard of you. Funny. This is my pack. No trouble. We're leaving. Dad. Hey, pull out for a second. This is my boy. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you. He's a grade-A son of a bitch. Done three tours for this country. That's the United States of America, in case you shit-for-brains don't realize it. We're all on the same side. And this is his brother. Same goes for this man. Blood runs thick in our family. And if you boys feel like two-stepping, then, God, I hope you do. Let's not waste any more time. We'll rest in peace when we are dead. It's three against ten. Anyone takes another step, I'll pop this bone out and I'll feed it to him. Get back. Get the fuck back. Dad? Dad. - Dad. - Let go off Hank. Hank? Your name's Hank? You look more like a princess to me. - All right... - Hey, hey, hey. We're cool. We're cool. Let him go. Hey, wait. That's my boy. - Wow, wow, wow. - Dad, you're drunk. - Get him out of here pronto. - Good idea. Let's go get drunk. I thought you guys were done for today. Man. Stop. Come here. Son. I love you. I love you too, Dad. I really do. - Dad, Dad, Dad. - Mr. Wittenburg. Oh, my God! No way. Yes way. Mr. Wittenburg ran right up to that first Harley Sportster 883, stroke or no stroke, before we could do anything, the tip of his boot was pushing off. But he told you that night, Rusty, "I love you." My God, that is a lovely story. Your dad was bad ass Wolf. Stroke and all. Here's to Mr. Wittenburg. Mr. Wittenburg. To you, Dad. Yeehaa! Boys, it's on. What the fuck? Well, I guess... I guess I better cut this out so you boys can have it real quick. Okay, I'll get her home. I'll get everything ready. I want a word with Rusty. - Hey, kiddo. - Hi. How are you doing? - Wow. - She got big. - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't care about all that mumbo jumbo out there. We'll get him back. Make sure he gets home, please. We're all coming home, okay? - Okay, thanks. - You're welcome. I'll call you tonight and you can stay whenever you need. Thanks. Thanks. Hey, hey. You okay? I just need to think or something. You all right? Where are you going? I don't know, honestly. It could be something as simple as Syria. Sure. As many times as I've been through this, I never get used to it. I'm scared. I know. Oh, don't give me that fake smile. All right. Get over here. Listen to me. I am not leaving you. I'll go do my nine-to-five, get in the train, come home to you guys, come home to the family, to the new family. Hey, I love you. I love you, too. Do you have to blend in? You wanted that? I don't know. Honey. I don't wanna talk about it. Babe. I don't. Mommy is sad because you have to go to work again, huh? Yeah. Hey, go give mommy a big hug and tickle her for me, okay? Okay. Daddy? Huh? Never mind. I need you to take care of mommy when I'm gone, okay? Okay. I'll only be gone a couple days. Promise. You're forgetting something. There you go. Now your promise is sealed. I love you, Daddy. Hey. Now you go take care of Mommy, okay? - I love you, Daddy. - I love you, too. Wait, Rus. I love you. Hey, I'm coming back. I'm not gonna miss this. But what if something happens that you can't control? I'm coming back, and that's all I know. All right? All right? Hey, you trust me? You trust me? I fucking love you. She's leaving me, Wolf. She's really fucking leaving. She tells me I've been gone too long. What kind of excuse is that? I know I've been gone too long. We need to drag it up. Let her the fuck go right now. Sunny. let her go. Clear this. Clear this. Are we good? Yeah. Are we good? That's Sunny. All units, this is Seven November Golf. While you're down... What's the verdict, Pope? Surprise us and tell us we're going after someone other than sand niggers? I love it when you talk dirty to me. Gather around and shut the fuck up. They're gonna fill you in more, but basically, four of our Delta Operatives went dark after they crossed into Iranian territory, and that's all I know. Search and Rescue? That's all I know. Gentlemen. Senior. Slayers. Your objective is special reconnaissance. Counter terrorist operation. This mission will be code named Gold Quilt. Major Boggs. Senior. Fifty-eight hours ago, a four-man Delta unit was dropped off in the Farah province on a Recon and Surveillance mission that would maneuver across Iranian border. We have intel that several high value targets from multiple terrorist factions are collaborating and supporting a rapidly growing ISIS element new to the area. We believe that they are utilizing this location in Iran to develop biochemical weapons. Not gonna lie, guys, comms have been giving us a fucking headache. Six hours into the op, we lost all contact. It's imperative that we get eyes on the ground down there immediately. Sunny, you're the best we have. Be prepared. Recent intel tells us the Iranians are conducting solid MIJI operations against our communications hardware. Copy that. Senior. IC knows the MIJI component and they're working quick to counter. A satellite imagery shows the mine to be abandoned during daylight. However, there has been vehicle drop-offs and runs at night. Activities has picked up, which is of grave concern. SIGNET also suggests there is an underground facility. We need to know every single thing about this location. Entry points, non-roads, wind direction. You'll be working under extremely diverse terrain. Weather pattern has been unpredictable. Questions? Speak up. Lieutenant? What about QRF? No QRF. Is that even possible? It is. You'll be dropped over here at an Afghani territory. This is as far as air support can go. United States has no air jurisdiction. So when you pass over the Iranian border, you are on your own. Again, we may not have comms. Sync your count down. Don't miss your window. Senior, do we have any type of overhead or pattern analysis by night on vehicles or personnel? Nothing substantial. Armed guards been on rotation. How many? Can't tell. They're all hooded, they look the same. We do not have high level surveillance due to no-fly zone. That's one detail we need to find out. There are red flags popping up all over the place on this one. We were lucky to discover it when we did. Do not mistake it's vacant appearance. We believe it may be a hive. Rusty. So nothing on the Delta Operators? I'm afraid not. Your objective is detailed reconnaissance. Don't be compromised. We need you to snoop and poop. Rusty. So why not just send the two of us? Yeah. No can do. As you can see, too much ground to cover. We need you to split up. We need you in and out, twelve hours. We're going to set you up with a Wi-Fi system. Your intel will come back encrypted. Team Leader will designate as needed and conduct a full CONOP prior to insert. You'll need to fill multiple roles. Anything else? You leave in 45. Slayers, kick ass. Get us what we need. Godspeed, fair wind. Have a good mission men. Stu. How's your new addition? He's amazing. Thanks for asking, Janet. Cheer up. It's kind of messed up we wouldn't be addressing the Delta team. Not gonna lie, I thought the same thing. No air assets? Senior Chief has got upper crust shitting down his neck, that means he's gonna shit down us. This is not a Search and Rescue mission. CBRNE takes priority. The mission takes priority over everything. So quit your bitching. All right. Gold Quilt. Okay, Phase One insert is Burt, 2300. Now, Scorpion, congrats, you're assistant team lead and point in this. Don't forget your bible. I won't, sir. Now I'm a second and meds. Since we don't have any breeches in this, Casper and Rooster, you're gonna take the rear. Now, we're gonna move west along this tree line here till we get to the rally point. That's Phase Two, Kermit. And, Sunny, you're designated RTO in this 'cause you're... You're the best we got. That's what Darla said. Oh... Sunny side up. Seriously, you heard them. Something is giving comms a headache. So when you get there, get all the comms tethered. Make sure all of our radios, including our whispers, are synced and encrypted in the latest freqs. We're already FUBAR with this no-fly zone shit. Naked as a fuck. - Good? - Good. Now, Casper and Scorpion, you're gonna remain back here with Sunny. Sit tight and stay alert. Now, Little Mann and Rooster, you guys are blue overwatch. You're gonna come up here and nest in right over here. God, I love you, sir. Okay, now, Wolf and I are gonna be green, heading northeast here. We're going to nest in right about there. We're gonna be in these positions for a while, so get me everything. Detail, detail, detail. Don't be lazy. They gave us this one for a reason. Make us look good. Exfil will be 0930. This will be Phase Four, Cookie Monster. Now relay back to rally point and then we're gonna head for home base. Phase five, Ernie, 1100, which is also our drop dead time. Now if you guys miss that one, you might as well get a green card, 'cause you're gonna be staying a fucking while. You're the most loyal, toughest sons of bitches I ever met. It is an honor to roll with you. All right, Slayers, we'll be moving quickly. Get your Desert Dragon skins on, cowboy up and lets jam. You've got 20 Mike, and we're off to the land of the Great Pashtun. Let's do it. Move out. Here we go. Let's do this, guys. Team Leader, you are about five Mikes out. Rooster. Sun rises in six hours. We got a good mile and a half height ahead of us, so we have to high tail it. Second boots are down, secure the parameter. ABC's. We're gonna stay as single unit, so we're about two and a half miles out at Kermit. Drop Dead is at eleven hundred so don't be late. Let's go home in one piece, Slayers. This is Rally Kermit. Sunny, hook up comms. Stay dark. Do not break radio silence until you hit your POS. At 0930, start getting your asses back here, we'll make our way to extraction point. Copy. Sunny, you good with comms? - I'm on it. - Good. If you are compromised, pass Taylor Swift. Stay frosty. I don't see one single goat fucker out there. Nothing but sand and dust. I'm dead. Yikes! You got hairy! Hi, Gusty, Rusty, Shmusty. As long as you're within my reach, I can protect you from them. I'm afraid that won't do much good here. Told you. I got you these the other day. Do I know you? They don't like strangers. I've tried to tell them about you, but they don't seem to care. Who's they? The wickeds and the scurries. Who's the... Little girl? Little girl! Huh. What's a blue jay doing out here? Well, as long as he keeps singing, we'll be all right. You know, she's never seen the Northern Lights. It's time to take her, then. Yeah. She's always wanted to do that. Twenty Mikes. Copy that. Twenty. What? I was thinking about your Pavarotti bird story. "Have you heard this all in the mocking bird?" - Yeah, that's the one. - Is it? Yeah. Little mocking bird sat in my window sill. I was about ten years old. Every day it'd start singing at dawn, wake my ass up. And then just this incredible data pool, I mean, they remember everything that they hear day after day until they die. I mean, everything. Car horns, buses, melodies from other birds. And I shit you not, if this thing heard a piano concerto, he could spit it back at you note by note perfectly. I mean, they mimic anything and everything. So it would wake me up every day. And what I'd do, I'd count his different noises, like counting sheep, you know, so I'd fall back asleep. This one day, I swear to God, he did over a hundred different noises. It was amazing. A fucking Pavarotti bird. And... I fell back asleep. About a week later, uh... It woke me up. I counted, fell asleep. Next thing you know, sound of a. 22 wakes me up. Neighbor fucking shot him. You know what the moral of the story is? Always go out doing something that you love. - Pavarotti bird. - Pavarotti bird. Castle reaching departure time, over. Castle reaching departure time, over. We definitely got some interference. We're being jammed. Smooth. Just how I like it. Gotta trust, Sunny. Not in the sunshine yet. Well, this will keep the clouds away. Almost game time. Mm. Breakfast of champions. Better save some of that for the ride home. That's a wrap, Wolf. Let's go home. I like the sound of that. Kermit, Green, over. Cookie Monster, Green copy. - Easy breezy. - Nice and cheesy. Oh, shit. What you got? Seven hostiles, two hostages. Execution squad. Just what I wanted. Are those our boys? Oh, standby. Hostiles are armed with AK-47's and secondaries. They got a tripod and recorder. Two machetes. Waiting for confirmation. Gotta give us something. Come on, baby. Looks like they came out of that rock formation. Right there. Chapman. We're running out of time. Lieutenant Blake Chapman, what have you gotten yourself into? Something's off. They'd be expecting a rescue. Using us as bait. Might already know we're here. I'm thinking the exact same thing. We touch anything down there and we're compromised. It's a perfect trap. We got what we came for. - We're running out of time. - No. No. How do we justify that, huh? These are somebody's kids. We're frogmen, sir. Good Wolf. Taylor Swift. I say again, Taylor Swift, Slayers. Change of plans. We are on the fly. Green has a PID on one of our Delta Operators. We are on a rescue. Blue hold tight at Oscar. Scorpion, Casper, I need you for back up at pivot. Sam, hell! Fucking A! Roger that. Let's move. Courtesy-Six. This is Avalanche. Taylor Swift. I repeat, Taylor Swift. We have PID on one of our Delta operators. We are shifting to rescue. Over. Casper, meet you at pivot point. Scorpion, over. Little Mann has eyes on the lynch mob. I do not have eyes on you, Green. I need you to position over there. Cover my ass. I'm going in with you. No. Keep your battle at a distance. Watch my ass. Pope! Green is at pivot. Pope is moving in fast. Little Mann, stand by to engage. Over. Scorpion, what's your POS? Little Mann is taking tango with machete on hostage closest to my POS. Engage targets at the end of my countdown on zero. Over. What the fuck's happening? The Hadjis are about to be pissed. Copy, Little. I got tango on your two, on your trigger. Over. Vanessa! Vanessa! Vanessa! Vanessa! I know you're there. Why are you playing games? You like hide and seek. - What's your purpose? - What's your purpose? You left your flowers. I picked them for you, each one. Now they're all dead. Your friends are back. Wouldn't call them friends if you knew what they wanted from you. They don't like you. I don't like them. And take that silly thing off. Who is Vanessa? What's a soul-taker? How many souls have you taken? - I said take it off. - Take it off. I heard you. You don't know who I am, do you? Take it off. Take it off for me. Boo! What? You expect something else? Vanessa?

Sunny, come back! Hang on! I waited for you, Rusty. I waited for you like I said I would. But it's okay. Your secret's safe with me. - What secret? - You know. Who are you? You got old, Rusty. No pun intended. You never came back to say goodbye like you promised. But it's okay. I know you were scared. I was, too. Ryan? Rusty, Shmusty, Gusty. Ryan. Took you long enough. You were my best friend. We were soulmates. You always were a silly boy. You had me at goodbye. Can I ask how long it's been? You don't know? It's been about 30 years. Doesn't seem like it, huh? Guess that's why they say, "Where does time fly?" None of them were easy. You didn't miss much. I missed you. I missed you, Rusty. Is there anything I can do? You can free yourself of the weight you've carried your whole life for not coming to see me. - What do I do? - It's easy. You're the one that's been watching me my whole life. What happens when I cross that line? Everything and nothing. I must look like the saddest little girl in the entire world. Hi, Ryan. Rusty, Gusty, Shmusty. Hey. Mommy, I saw Daddy. Olivia, baby, what are you talking about? Mommy, I promise I saw him. He was with a white beautiful angel. She was carrying another man. Olivia, sweetie, you're being silly, okay? We don't joke about this. But I'm not kidding. Baby, you understand that Daddy's at work, right? Yeah? And that means that he's just in a different country. No, he's right outside. Honey, all right? We can't joke about this. I'm not joking. I'm serious. He's outside. I think you're just tired. Let's go to bed. - Let's go. - No. Go. See? See? It's Daddy, Mommy. I heard him. Who's there? Stay right there, okay? Excuse me. Are you okay? Baby, stay. Vanessa. Vanessa. Rusty? Vanessa. Rusty. Subtitles by explosiveskull
