A TRANSLATOR BASED ON A TRUE STORY And at this moment, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, emerges from the plane. Together with Fidel, a great number of men and women from Havana cheer the arrival of Gorbachev in this, his first visit to Cuba and Latin America. I saw him! I saw him, Dad! - Should we go tell Mom? - Yeah! Good. Mama! - Mama! - Tell me, Javi! Mama! I saw him! Mama! I saw him! You did? - He waved at me! - Really? You'll have to tell me all about it. How was it? Packed. No one else could join. You didn't tell me how the interview with the Soviet writer went. Good. In fact, she said something really interesting. She has this theory that... Soviets and Cubans share a sense of isolation. They're cut off by the land... and we... stoic in the sea. How does it apply to your thesis? I don't know yet. I'm going to work on it tonight. What's wrong? You promised you'd read to me tonight. "Kikirikí, kikirikí," crowed the rooster. And that was the last they ever heard of the robbers. You didn't do it right. Why? Mama does the voices. Well... I'll do the voices next time. Good night. "I am a nobleman," "I, too can earn rank." Why does he say he's an aristocrat? I don't think that he means that he's an aristocrat. Just that he has value as a human being. He's going mad because his social status doesn't allow him to have the life he wants. Besides, his social status affects his life. He's in love with the director's daughter, but she won't look at him because he's just a clerk. Good job. Make a case for Poprishchin's madness: A thousand words... due a week on Friday. Forty-five liters, honey. Hey! I said one, not ten. I have my own money. Then you pay. Fifty pesos. ATTENTION DEPARTMENT OF RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE. ALL CLASSES ARE SUSPENDED EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY - I don't know what that means. - Look who's here. - Malin. - What is this? Yours says the same as mine. But mine says morning. - Mine too. - Mine doesn't say anything. What I don't understand is why have we been divided this way? Because this is absurd and ridiculous. Like always here. - I'm going to talk to the dean. - What for? Kristina, you know that our glorified administrator couldn't change a lightbulb without permission. - Look at him. - Hernandez! Orders from above. - Oh, Kristina. - I told you. Do you want advice? Don't waste your time. I'm going to get paid. Hey! Did the letter say anything else? No, there was an address and that was it. Will you still be able to pick up Javi? I don't have to be there till 7:00 p.m. Who knows... you might finally finish your thesis. That would be nice. Are you done yet? Not yet. Don't stay up all night. I'll be in soon. HAVANA GENERAL HOSPITAL Staff room, please? - Elevator. Second floor. - Thank you. What's wrong with her? Do something. She's waking up. Something's happening to her. A minute, please. No! No more drugs. Please. No more drugs. I want her to wake up. - She's in a lot of pain. - Please. Do something. We aren't going to hurt her. Remove your hand. - Please. - I want you to do something. - Not just that. Do something. - We won't hurt her. She wants you to try something else. She wants you to try something else. She's in a lot of pain. Tell her. She's in a lot of pain. Why did you stop the treatments? What's happening? She's refusing the morphine. Who are you? Malin. They sent me from the university. Translator? Professor. Tell her we'd hoped for a more positive response to the radiation, but... unfortunately, there's been a tumoral growth. Tell her, please. I... They... They had hoped that... her reaction to the radiation therapy would be better... but her condition has gotten worse. We've been unable to eliminate the disease. Which means, eliminate the cancer cells. So the transplant won't be possible. They'd been hoping to perform... a trans... trans... transplant. But since they've not been able to get rid of the cancer, the procedure is not possible. We came here for this procedure. That's why they came. I'm afraid at this point all we can do is manage her pain. Unfortunately, at this point... all they can do is... manage her pain. Can I? Stasia... Everything will be okay. My baby girl. My love. We thought maybe you got lost. I know why we're here. Why? Good evening. Good evening. I'm Dr. Rivas, Chief Physician and Hospital Administrator. It's a busy night so I'll be brief. As you know, you'll be supporting our staff on an as-needed basis. Each of you has been assigned to a ward. Every night come straight here. The schedule is on the board. Any questions? Support with what? Because we don't know. You're here to translate. Translate for whom? For the patients from Chernobyl. Felipe? - It's you. - It's me. You're on the third floor with Antonia. - Ronaldo? - Me. You're with Seleste. Malin. You're with the Argentinean, Gladys. Well, that's all. They had to move all the regular patients to different hospitals to make room for them. We had no idea there'd be so many. Why'd they send them here? An act of kindness by a leader with a big heart. No, they couldn't handle them all there. Babies are being born with serious diseases. They are building a hospital in Tarará just for them. Sounds like another master plan. It's not contagious. So? It's a hospital. What? We're there to translate for a bunch of Soviets. From Chernobyl. They assigned me to the Children's Ward. RUSSIAN-SPANISH DICTIONARY Where's Stasia? She died this morning. Good evening. Good evening. Where's her mother? Probably packing. Already? The Soviets pay to get them here, Cuba covers the treatment costs. When it's done, they go. We did everything we could, Malin. Swap wards with me. No, no, you can't. No. You were assigned. We're translators, not specialists. Who can I talk to? I know who you can talk to. To Fidel! Malin! Malin! - Grandma! - My love! Hugs and kisses for your grandmother. How big you're growing. - Mama. - Beautiful. My precious grandson. - How is my champion? - Good. Look at all of these things. I don't know what I would do without you guys. - Everything is quiet. - Good. The diplomatic visit of President Gorbachev ended today... Did you hear what Fidel said the other day? Gorbachev is softening. Flirting with capitalism. Flirting is shit... If the Soviets enter the free market, he'll have to consider it. It's not in line with his idea of socialism. - It'd be bad for us anyway. - Yes? Right now the Soviets give us oil in exchange for sugar. Who else is going to give us a deal like that? Can we talk about something else? How is working nights going, Malin? No, no... I don't want to talk about that either. I'll help you. How's he doing? I'm not going back. I'm going to ask for a transfer. Dr. Rivas reported you to the Ministry. Gladys told them you were sick. - And now what? - Now what? Say the same thing. You are sick. Recovered? Enough. Very good. We're in isolation. Face mask. No. Top. His immune system is weak. We can't risk infection. Hello, handsome. Hello. This is Malin. He is here to translate for you. This is Alexi. Tell him, please. I'm Malin. A translator. You speak Russian? Yes. Why? Sit down, please. Have you ever seen a lava rock? When you kick them, they smoke. Hello. How are you? Hello. Please. I've been sitting long enough. Is this a new doctor? Translator. Nice to meet you. Good, you're all here. Alexi's white blood cell count is up by a full point and his red cell count is in the normal range. Alexi's white blood cell count is up a point. His red blood cells are level. We'll continue as we have been with the chemotherapy and hope to see continued progress. They'll keep going with chemotherapy and hope to keep seeing progress. So it's working? It's working? It's progress. There is progress. I don't want more chemo. I don't like it. It's good news. Your body's fighting. LEUKEMIA Thank you. CHEMOTHERAPY Do you want to be a doctor now? I tried that - but it didn't work out. - You? I went to med school. Seriously? One semester. That I would believe. Have this. To help you sleep. You look tired. "One day, Chicken Little was walking through the forest." "One day, Chicken... Little was walking through the forest. And all of a sudden... an acorn fell on her head. Bonk." How long have you been doing this? Are you going to tell me that I can't do this either? No. I was just thinking... it would be good to do a story time. No? Are there houses that are more beautiful than ours? I imagine... most likely. Is that why you don't sleep at home? I sleep at home. - No. - Yes. But not at night. I've been working at the hospital. Are you a doctor already? I'm working on my doctorate. It's a different kind of doctor. Can I watch cartoons? Yes. Sorry. My meeting ran late. Javi has eaten. Your dinner is in the fridge. What is it? I'm pregnant. I thought we agreed no more. Not after Javi's delivery. You'll see, it won't be like before. I want you to be happy. I'll be fine. CUBAN CHILDREN'S STORIES Hello, everyone. How many of you like to travel? Today... we are not going to travel in a vehicle... but I'm going to take you away from here. Find yourself a place. Come on. Come on. Come on. Thank you. "'The Beekeeper's Child.' Carlitos lived in a valley, nestled between the mountains and the sea. His father was a beekeeper and his grandfather before that. But Carlitos wanted to see the world. Carlitos got lost..." Would you like to hear a story? This book was one of my favorites. Listen. - "Carlitos lived in..." - Leave! Everything okay? Yes. So, you're a teacher? Professor. Of Russian Literature. Me, I teach high school. You know, it was a big honor for me to get the job in Prypiat. They brought the best scientists from all around the country, and they took me to teach their kids. Then... well. You're the only father I've met here. - I was his cell donor. - Ah. We've tried with his own cells but it didn't work. Seems to be effective this time. We have good days. And bad days. It's strange. Radiation did this to him... then they give him more to make it go away. What do you think? How much radiation do you think one body can take? I lived in Leningrad for five years. You asked why I speak Russian. I studied at the university there. Have you been? It's very near our dacha. You probably miss it. I miss it. The art, the music... the fish soup. Damn! I don't always want to talk either. Maybe you would want to write about it? I didn't know that you smoke. I needed fresh air. You picked the best spot. - I hate it. - I know, me too. It's disgusting. No. This place. Hospitals, diseases. That they make me do this. You know what? Fuck that! I came to this country for two reasons. Videla was a son of a bitch and this island has one of the best medical systems in the world. You don't want to be here? Who wants to be here? No one does. But you are here! Period. - Find a way to deal with it. - You chose to be a nurse! You chose. I didn't. I didn't choose any of this. These kids didn't choose either. You're back early. I miss you. I'm tired. What's that? Read it to me. "In darkness I can see it, The flashing, colored light. Seeps in from out, Goes out from in The bright and shimmering light. The light, it came with black dust We watched and breathed it in The light, it went inside me And then the world caved in. And now I wait in darkness For sunlight to return For light that's clear and constant For light less beautiful." It's stupid. It's exceptional. That's what it looked like? It went up and down. Not like a normal rainbow. You can read yours, if you want. "'The Beekeeper's Child.' Carlitos lived in a valley, nestled between the mountains and the sea. His father was a beekeeper... and his grandfather before that. But Carlitos wanted to see the world..." You can write anything you want, they don't have to be stories. Poems, pictures, a journal. Anything. Write what you want. She can't write. Then draw something. Thank you. Thank you. You said anything. Javi! Be careful! Javi. Did Mama say she'd be late? I don't know. Hey, come on. Where's Isona? - Sorry. I need another half hour. - I have to go to work. - Where do you want this? - The end wall. - It's not appropriate for him to stay. - What do you want me to do? - Remember the ultrasound tomorrow at 8:00. - Yes. Go straight from the hospital. Are you God? We're not supposed to talk about God. I don't even know what he looks like. Old, with a beard and a white dress. Am I wearing white? Why are you scared of God? He took Stasia. It's a monumental blow to our collective battle for freedom, as thousands of East Berliners, encouraged by boisterous hoards of imperialist capitalists, began to chip away at this most noble symbol of equal rights for all workers... Malin. Malin! Excuse me. The bonds? It was all they had. - And they stopped issuing bonds. - What? Everything's cash only. You have to pick up your pay. I'll do it tomorrow. No, I can't do it tomorrow. Why? Because I have to go to the university. They invited me to do a series of guest lectures. It's too much, tell them you can't. I want to do it. It's good for me. We have found new lesions, which appear to be metastatic. Several new tumors have grown from the first cancer. Several new tumors have grown from the first cancer. "Carlitos was lost in the desert. He had nothing but his clothing. His water canister was..." What do the others look like? Are there more boys or girls? They... It's about the same. There's a girl, Elena. She's very good at sewing. What are you talking about? He wants to know about the other kids. One of these days, handsome. - What are you doing? - I need paper. Those are important. Today, I want each of you to write about yourselves. Things you like and don't like. - What is it? - Doesn't matter. Turn it over. Like this. The things... that make you, you. Don't forget to put your name and birthday at the top. "THE CHERNOBYL CHILDREN" FOR ALEXI That's the same birthday as me. Igor. My cosmonaut. He loves everything that has to do with space. They want to know about you. Malin, Malin, Malin... The King of the Kids. What are you doing there? Alexi! Come, come. Fernanda? Take her temperature, please. Alexi. Slowly. You okay? What were you doing? I got scared. - Is he making sense? - Yes. What? You look like you sound. I took Javi to the doctor today. He's lost five pounds. The doctor says he needs more high fat food. It could impact his development. Are you going to wake up, Malin? - I'm awake. - No, you're not. You sleep all day, you're gone all night. I'm alone with Javi at night and in the morning, but I'm not taking pills and shutting out the world. Do you think it's easy for me? - Work is crazy. The show's about to open... - It's just art. It's not your turn. Guys, what are you complaining about over there? I don't get it. - Hey, shut up! - I won't shut up. I'm in line. Pay me. This is messed up. Guys, listen! There's nothing left. There's nothing left. We're out! - This is the government's, not yours! - Yo! We're out! We're out! I am not Cuba-Petróleo. There's no more gas, papi. Good morning. Good morning. I'd like to close my savings account, please. Savings accounts can't be closed. You can withdraw a maximum of twenty percent. Twenty? Twenty. What would you like to do, comrade? Comrade? Do I know you? Do we work together? Then I'm not your comrade. The twenty. We need you in ICU. Relax! Be quiet! Quiet, I'm telling you. Don't scream. I don't understand what you are saying. Enough. I'm telling you. Stop it. Relax. I told you. Don't yell. What? What are you saying? I don't understand what you are saying! I don't understand... Tell her to be quiet! She has to stop or leave! Help her, please. Do something. Please tell them to loosen the straps. Can you loosen... Can you untie her hands? - Quiet. I'm telling you. - It's for her safety! This is for her safety. The doctor wants you to calm down or they'll make you leave. Quiet. Behave yourself. If you don't behave well, no one will help you. They will not help you! That's it, take her out right now. That's it. Look, baby. This area is the Caribbean. And this is the island of Cuba. We're here. I'll show you. Look... It's the shape of a sleeping alligator. There's the head. See? I need to talk to you. - I don't like it. - You haven't even tried it, Javi. What happened? Daniela sold two from this series. A thousand dollars each. Dollars? American dollars? Know what happens if we're caught with dollars? - We have to do something. - Yes. - Perez stole from the market. He'll sell... - No. We don't go near that. - We need food, Malin! - We have to find another solution. - We have no one to watch Javi on Friday. - What's Friday? - The opening! I've been working on it for... - Yeah! Do you think you could start late? - I'll be back by 2:00 a.m. - Probably. - Not "probably." I need to know. - I'll be here. Javi! Look what you did. Relax, it's just cornmeal. There's no "just" anything anymore. Hi. Thanks. They're planning to drain the fluid from his lungs. Tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. Tomorrow? I'll come early. What happened? You stink. Did you tell them it was us? What are you saying, Malin? It could have been anything. When the power's out, the AC goes too. Alexi was breathing every germ in the building. We dealt with the bigger problem at the time. That's what we do. Mommy. I'm hungry. Go to sleep. Take this one. RICE AND BEANS ARE IN THE FRIDGE I'LL BE HOME BEFORE 2:00 A.M. Javi. I have to go to work. Mama will be home any minute. Do you think you can look after yourself until she gets back? You can watch TV the whole time. Okay. Get out. Get out, please! Malin. "It had been three days. Carlitos' tongue was swollen. He needed water desperately. Carlitos looked out at the expanse of sand before him. At what was once the bottom... of the ocean." Where are the rest of the drinks? It's done. Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? "The one that does not look forward..." Malin? Javi? Malin? Javi? Javi. Darling, we were waiting for you. I found him crossing the street. Thank you, Maria. That's what neighbors are for. - Thank you, Maria. - Take care. I was all alone. Not anymore, my love. Vladimir. I'm sorry. Where the fuck were you? You were supposed to be here. I forgot. You forgot? He left alone, Malin. In the middle of the night. It's lucky Maria's so nosy... I can't even imagine. But he's okay? Is he hurt? Is he dying? No. But he's your son. On top of everything, Malin, he left the door open. Someone could have come in and stolen art. Of course. It's only art. It's not only art, Malin. It's what I do. Who I am. When you disregard it, you disregard me. Am I saving lives? No. But that doesn't mean what I do isn't important. It's important to me. I can't do this alone. Where are you going? Isona. I'm taking Javi to my parents for a while. It could have been anything. Fluid like that doesn't come from an infection. Malin, you can't take it home with you. If you don't leave it here, it'll drive you crazy. They finished the new facility. We're moving to Tarará. There's an orientation tomorrow. The bus leaves here at 9:00. We have nothing scheduled. You should go home to rest. Good morning. Welcome, everyone. I'm Rosa, administrator of this complex. Please, follow me. Very nice. Over here. This is the playroom. It will be supervised by staff throughout the day and provides an opportunity for independent play as well as... There's going to be a story time. Twice a day. You will be in charge of it. By chance? They might have taken suggestions. Rafa. Please. I just want to speak to my wife. Are you here to talk? I can't. This is the problem, Malin. I ask and ask and nothing. I'm not going to spend my life with a man who doesn't speak to me. I can't do it for you. Stop it. I'm telling you. Epinephrine. I'm giving her 100 bicarbonate. Starting compressions. Can you take me to the hospital. Malin. Dr. Rivas needs to talk to her. What? - What? - Malin! You might as well not be here. Passed out in there. - What if... What if she dies... - You have no right! You don't understand anything. I've been sitting with her, every minute. "With"? Maybe. But you are never there for her. Enough, Malin! Excuse me? Can I help you? I want things to be how they were before. Nothing can be like before. But maybe they can be different. - Is that me? - No. His name is Alexi. Javi. Come here. "Once upon a time there was a rooster who lived in a barn with all his friends. Pig, donkey, horse, cow and sheep. One day they went for a walk. 'It's too hot'... 'It's too hot', said the pig as they went along. 'I want some mud to wallow in.'" CLOSED. NO GAS Malin. We're done. What? They brought new patients, new translators... real translators. - That's it? It's finished? - It's finished. You heard? Won't there be some sort of transition? Did you get one at the beginning? I thought you'd be happy. Yes. You should feel very proud about everything you did. It was my duty. No. You did much more than that. I have to go back to my old job. Orders from above. But will you be visiting us? What did she say? She wants to know if I can visit. I'll come. Don't forget. May 10th... ballet... blue... and cabbage rolls. Professor! In "Diary," we see a man driven to madness. Driven to madness by the world he lives in. He escapes by creating his own reality. What was it like? - What? - At the hospital? What was it like? It was... It's done. Over 25,000 victims of Chernobyl were treated in Cuba for illnesses caused by radiation. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, the program continued until 2011. Malin and Gladys never saw each other again. Malin continued to teach Russian Literature until interest in the program declined. Malin and Isona divorced in 1995. Malin moved to Italy, where he still teaches literature. Isona continues to work as a contemporary art curator. Their sons directed this film.
