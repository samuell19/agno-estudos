I'm very sorry to learn of your abrupt departure, Princess Ordana. Urgent matters require my immediate presence back home. Speaking of home, how are things back on Earth? It's not looking good for humankind. Sorry to hear so. I hope all works out. We'll see. The best of luck to you and Earth, Princess Ordana. Thanks, General. We're gonna need it. Engage departure process. Here we go. We're on our way back to good old Earth. Captain, can you connect me to Senator Orden, security code 991142. Yes, Princess Ordana. One moment. Senator Orden. It's an honor to speak with you again. Princess Ordana. It's a blessing to hear your voice. I'm on my way back to join you at the World Protection League Assembly, Senator. Don't expect good news. It's a dangerous situation. There is chatter of a saboteur being deployed inside our operations. Did you hear from our old friend? You mean Captain Robert Tomlin? Last I heard was he is fighting with the American Raiders in the Outlands border region, fighting back the Neo-Chrome. - Is Melanie with him? - She is working in the environmental labs. They are under constant threat of attack. Please let them know that I send my warmest wishes and that I look forward to seeing them again soon. I will try to get a message through to them if possible. Thank you, Senator. I hope they're all right. Here we go. Woo! American Raiders to the rescue! Come on! American Raiders, take the battle to the enemy. Let's kick to Neo-Chrome butt! Neo-Chrome's on the run and I've got him. He won't get far. I'm right on his ass. Got him right in my crosshairs. Woo, got him! Failure to realize the reality of their defeat and certain termination of the United States. While Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and much of South America have already been overrun by our glorious, Neo-Chrome Army, it's the arrogant Americans who refuses to let themselves be ruled by the superior Neo-Chrome Rulership. How much more blood must be shed, red or black, before the United States will accept their demise and will forever cease to exist? Death to America! Death to America! Death to America! Death to America! Death to America! Death to America! The situation is getting worse by the minute. The forces of darkness are about to take over. We've been able to fight off the Neo-Chrome for the past three years, but the severity of the situation cannot be underlined enough. The Neo-Chrome advances on US soil have been unprecedented. Oh God! No more protection! The flagship is burning! God, no! It's a bloody ambush! We're being attacked! It's a surprise attack. Come on! Let's send 'em straight back to hell! Ah, it's too late. Uh! The World Protection League Flagship is going implode. It's gonna go! No! Eagle One, requesting disengagement. Mission Retaliation is a go, over. Repeat, Mission Retaliation is a go. Here we go. Not much time. Sir, the World Protection League Flagship has been destroyed, sir. That can't be, soldier. - Sir- - That's not possible, soldier, you know that. - It happened, sir. - Any survivors? - None. - What about my daughter? Princess Ordana is, we lost her. Neo-Chrome's on the run, 104. Let's send 'em straight back to hell. Here we go. For all of humankind. Target hit. Target hit. Good hit. Good hit. Heading back to base. The target's hit. Copy that. Good job, Eagle One. Mission completed. Over. Assemble the American Raiders. I wanna talk to them. Yes, sir. They are our last hope. No! Melanie! American Raiders assembled. You are here today to unite and fight for the future of our very existence. I want you to know, I'm proud of you. Semper Fi. Semper Fi! Get in, come on! Come on, let's go! Get over here! Move! Go, put out the fire, dammit! Let's go! Move this thing! - Hey, Tomlin. - Listen, sequence reports. I need them. How are they coming? I need to find out if there's any mistakes, glitches or snags before I roll this one out. The last thing I wanna do is piss off any customers now that business is booming, okay? And Tomlin, you come to the club, we'll take care of you. All right, brother. I'll see you up there. What do you say, Melanie? I wanted to ask you something. And I know that we talked about it before, but I want you to really think about it this time. What is it, Melly? Well, we've been together for nine years. I mean, don't you think it's time that we got married? As soon as the war is over me, Melly. I promise. Hmm. Do you think we're soul mates? We must be me, Melly. We must be. We've been together all these years. Okay? Oh, I got something for you. I want to open it here. What is this? It's a sign of our love. Thank you, baby. I love you, baby. I love you too. Hey, Tomlin. I was just checking on ya. Everything all right? - What do you want? - I was just checking on you. Hey, uh, you got any sequences you need help checking? On mine? Come on, man, give me a chance because I wanna play with the best. Plus, I know that you have access to all the latest sequences. Oh yeah? And how do you know that? Please. Man, I got skills, Tomlin. I looked you up. You were one of the hardcore gamers back in the original Ice Age. Come on. Just give me a chance to play with you and show you how good I am. I know that you test sequences for Calvin. What changed you, Tomlin? Was it the war? It's her, isn't it? You've never been the same since you lost her. I know she was your soul mate. I know what that means. I know what it's like to lose someone that you have an eternal connection with. And it's, it's easy to feel lost after you lose your best friend. I too lost my dad to the war. I'll never get over it, and I know you'll never get over what happened to you and her, but Tomlin, we're still breathing and we owe it to them to, to keep going because they're watching and because they want us to live and well 'cause it matters. I have a new sequence Calvin wants me to run. Wanna tag along? I would be delighted to. You're so not gonna regret this, man. Bomb salute. Uh! - Oh, shit. - Nice job. Yeah. Not bad. Are you looking for me? Yeah, you ugly cockroach. It's a glitch. The game froze. You need a driller bullet. See his core is in a shell. The only way to kill him is with a drill-head bullet. The one with the red tip. It'll drill right through his shell. And they go for a million points. Really? Are you ready to get outta here? Um, hey. Tomlin, Tomlin, I... Well I wanted to, um, well I wanted, I wanted to thank you for, you know, like taking me with you and stuff. Okay. I'll see you later. All right? Yeah, totally. You'll see me later. Um, you know, like if you need anything at all, you can call me because you know you're gonna need me. He'll need me one day. How is she? Her condition's unchanged. There's no indication at all she's coming back. All we can do is keep the machines going and hope for the best. Drink it immediately. - Fun. - Mm, thank you, brother. Here you go. - Sorry I'm late. - Yeah, no. Hold on, brother. I'm confused. So where's the glitch? It's at the end of the game. It's at the final stage when you're about to kill Neo-Kahn, the action suddenly freezes up on you. Which is what I told you. Okay. Why? It has to do with the fact that there aren't enough points in the game in order to terminate the son of a bitch. See, I don't, I don't know what that means. You have to have at least a million points accumulated because in order to kill Neo Kahn, because you have to trade in for a red drill-head bullet. And we only have 957,000. Right, I mean, is that, is what she's saying, is that right? There's not enough points to be had in the game? Tell your guy that forgot to put you on that special object is gonna earn you a million points. Everything else is shoot 'em up sequence stuff based on an original Dorian Terrell 3-D game engine, modified with Neo-Chrome graphics, all standard stuff. Tomlin, you gonna come program some new sequences for us. This shit's exploding right now and nobody can do it like you. Calvin, I can't do it anymore. Come on, Tomlin. We miss you. No, I'll troubleshoot the occasional sequence for you and that's it. Ah, war must have been a little rough on you, huh? How is she? Still the same. Well, listen, we're gonna go and let you do whatever the hell it is you do in that apartment of yours, right? Here's some money for you. Thank you. - Thanks. - Yeah, of course. Tomlin, if there's anything you need, anything whatsoever, don't hesitate to call, okay? Our lines are always open. All right? Always open all. - All right. - All right? Ah, um. All right. - All right. - Oh, you kidding me? Mm. Bye, buddy. Send her my regards. Hey, kind of late to be alone at night. All right. Let's go, come on, let's go. Hey, let's get out of here. We're here. I had you brought here because you are the best. For what? For the job I'm about to offer you. I'm a damn legless cripple. Trust me, Mr. Tomlin. There is only one man for the job, that's you. What job exactly are you referring to? A mission. A rescue mission, if you will. - To rescue what? - Our World. The planet is fucked. And there's no way back. We both know that. What if I tell you there is a way? I'd tell you you're crazy. You can call me that if you like, but that wouldn't change my resolve in pursuing certain options that are available to me. - What options? - Oh, come to that in a moment. First we have to make sure we're all on the same page. As president, I have tremendous responsibility. I have to make sure that certain things are executed to the T. Even if I don't agree with measures sometimes, but sometimes tough measures get tough things accomplished. Melanie. What did you inject her with? Very sorry, Mr. Tomlin. A virus has infected Private Hendy. No! We don't have much time, Mr. Tomlin. The clock is ticking. The virus is moving towards her heart as we speak. Once it reaches it, Private Hendy will pass. What are you saying? There is only one way to clean the system from the invading forces as well as destroy the virus in Private Hendy's bloodstream before it reaches her heart. What do you want me to do? Are you sure you are ready for this? I'll do whatever it takes. Now that I have your attention, we can talk constructively. - I'm all ears. - Have you ever heard of Dorian Terrell? You mean the inventor of the original 3-DS Engine? Do you know whatever happened to him? Nobody knows for sure, I think, I think he died in the late 60's. What else do you know? Many people compare him to that other guy from the early 20th century, Einstein. His theories and thecalculations are the very foundation in which the 3-DS Grid was built upon. Terrell was a genius. No doubt. He also knew that one day the grid couldn't withstand an attack from the outside. That's why he integrated a security measure into thesystem, a switch, so to speak, in the event evil forces should ever attempt to overrun the system. A total reboot of the system in order to wipe out any and all invading elements. I never heard of that. Terrell was a dreamer, a, a gamer, a child at heart. You are a gamer. This is your chance to save the World, Mr. Tomlin. As well as Melanie. - What's the mission? - You need to find the switch. It's also known under a different name. - What's that? - The Indochine. Ever heard of it? No. You need to find it and switch it on. That's the only way to destroy the virus and the invading forces before they destroy us all. You've got 18 hours. I wouldn't know where to begin. Before Mr. Terrell passed in 2062, he gave this to his wife Emily. The Eye of the Beholder. It's a Masonic symbol from two centuries ago. Or new Order of the Ages. Beginning of a new era. His wife Emily sent it to the residing president of the United States just before she died and joined her husband being frozen. It has been passed on from president to president since then, till the day its secret would have to be uncovered as it would hold the last chance for survival for the human race. Farewell, Mr. Tomlin. We're all counting on you. Yeah, Ben Gordon here. Lieutenant Gordon. Captain R. Tomlin. How are you? Tomlin? Robert Tomlin. You old hound dog. How you doing? Uh, we haven't talked since- - Since I lost her and my legs. Yeah. Sorry. How you holding up, man? Look, Gordon. I don't have a lot of time. I've got a job and I need good men to help me execute. What'd you say if I asked you first? What kind of job are we talking? That's classified at this point, but, uh, let's just say it comes from the highest authorities. - From who? - More importantly, Private Hendy's life depends on. Private Hendy? What are you talking about? I thought she was in a coma. A deadly virus is heading towards Melanie's heart as we speak, we have 14 hours to execute. Okay. All right. Gordon, there's one more thing I have to tell you. This might be a mission with no return. A suicide mission, huh? Wow. I wouldn't have any other way. Oh, and Gordon, I'll need the usual band of brothers. Don't worry about that. I'll bring three of my best. Do I know any of them? Nah. They're all new material. Are they good enough for the job? - They're the best. - Look forward to meeting them. All right. When and where do we meet? 3DS. universe. 5238. dragon square. street. Main grid. 20 minutes. Okay. I'll see you there, my friend. Over and out. Been too long, man. Another two, please. I am very grateful for your help, Gordon. I mean it. I gotta tell you though, I was only able to commit two men to this mission. 'Cause of the short notice, you know? I mean. We'll work with what we've got. All right. All right. They should be here any minute. Sergeant Ramirez reporting for active duty, sir. Sergeant Ramirez. Glad that you could make it. This is a very important mission here. I'd like you to meet the old friend of mine. Captain Robert Tomlin. Captain. A pleasure to meet you. I've heard lots about you. Well, it's good to meet you too, Sergeant Ramirez, I'm looking forward to working with you. My sincere condolences about what has happened to your loved one, sir. Oh, thanks, Sergeant Ramirez. Appreciate your thoughts. My brother was lost in the war as well. Sorry to hear that. I would do anything to make him proud, sir. All right. At ease, Sergeant. Here's Sergeant Vargaz now. Lieutenant Gordon. It's an honor to serve with you again, sir. You must be Captain Tomlin. It's an honor meeting you, Sergeant Vargas. That's it. That's the team. So you gonna brief us in? It's on a need-to-know basis. Tomlin, I would normally never take a, a mission like this under these circumstances, but I trust you. Yes, I know. Hey, looks like you could use another man. What are you doing here? This is a dangerous job, not a game. Hey. We all gotta die sometime right? Might as well die doing something worthwhile. I got skills, Tomlin. All right. Gordon, this is Minnesota and she's an exceptional player. All right. Welcome aboard. Glad to have you. All right. Well, let's go do this. Look. This is the great seal. What are you talking about? The great seal, man. Thank you. Thank you very much. So what is this? That's the symbol leading to the Indochine. The Indo what? The item we're looking for. All right, let's, let's get some of these boxes out of the way. So what do you want us to do with this? - Let's move it. - All right. You heard him. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, come on. Gordon, tell the men to clear the area. All right. Let's step back. Holy cow. Well, well what do we have here? Looks like a tunnel to the building next door. Looks like somebody doesn't want us to go in there. Are you man enough for the challenge? My men will follow me to the end of the World if I tell him to. It's fine with me. No problem here, sir. How about you? - Hey. - All right. Let's enter the belly of the beast. Uh! What's that? Toothpick. - Why now? - I'm trying to quit smoking these damn cigars. - Yeah, right. - Excuse me. Must have been abandoned a long time ago. Uh. Welcome to St. Augusta. So how's that toothpick working out for you? Well, it ain't no cigar that's for sure. Clear. Tomlin. Seriously, man, this is not funny. Seriously, man, this is not funny! Oh, hey. How are ya? Zombies! Damn. Ah, zombies. Why zombies? Yeah, I'd rather deal with Neo-Chromes if you ask me. I hate zombies. Mm-hmm. Minnesota! Right here! Shit. Looks like the party's started. Looks like we stirred the hornet's nest. The more we shoot them, the more new ones appear. Watch out! The classic watershed routine. The more you dig a problem, the bigger it gets. Whoever designed this earlier knew it. There has to be a back door out of here somehow. Yeah, but what if there isn't one? Prepare to have your brains eaten. Going to run out of ammo soon. They're getting closer! There's gotta be an elevator in here somewhere. Elevator. There must be an elevator. Bingo. That must be it. - Must be what? - The back door. The way to level one. Ramirez, you see an elevator down there? I can see it, sir. It's down that hallway. Okay, let's get there. Let's move, move, move, move!~ Let's go! Move! Get the door! Move it! Come on! Come on! It's coming! Move, move, move, move, move, move! Where's that elevator? It's coming! Where the hell is that elevator? Oh shit! I'm out of ammo! Be torn to pieces! Get me the elevator! Hurry! Come on! Hold! All right, go on move back, move back! Come on, we gotta move back, move back! All right. Come on. We gotta move back. Come on! Get back, back up in here, in here! Back, back, get in! Let's go, get in! Get in! Let's go! Get those doors closed! Gordon! Get those closed! Get him off! Got bit. Gordon, you okay? Everybody reload. Shit. That was close. Give me your hand. You know they're gonna come after us. Right? I'll stay behind and hold them back as long as I can. You have to continue on your way. You sure about that, Ramirez. She knows what she's doing. You've gotta get going. There won't be much time. I've got your backs. All right. Let's go. Go. Ramirez. Keep radio contact. Yes, sir. All right. I don't want you to do this, Ramirez. It's suicide. Don't worry about me, captain. I know what I'm doing. Besides, if my brother can sacrifice himself for his country, so can I. Hmm. Sure? Yes, sir. Go save your loved one. Do it for me. Thank you. Here. Thank you, sir. Good luck, sir. See you on the other side. - Hear that? - Yeah, yeah. Vargaz, you wanna check that out? Go ahead. Go ahead. Hey. Be careful. Let's go. - What's your name? - Emily. Uh. What are you drawing there? You. A shark? Hey, where are you going? - Vargaz, come in. - Yes, sir. Everything okay over there? I got everything under control here. Tomlin. - Hey little boy. - Hey. Hi. How are you? - Who are you? - I'm Robert Tomlin. And this is Lieutenant Gordon and my friend Minnesota. What's your name? Dorian Terrell? How do you know that? - Just a hunch. - Why are you here? Are you gonna play with me? Actually, we are here with a very special plea, Dorian. I have a friend who is also my soulmate and she's very ill. What's wrong with her? A virus has her in its control, a very deadly virus and it's traveling towards her heart and when it gets there, it's gonna be too late. So a very important person told me that there's only one thing that can save her. What's that? They told me it's called the Indochine. Indochine. Hmm. I'm not sure, but maybe it can be that thing upstairs leading up to the tower. - What thing upstairs? - I'm not sure what it's for, but it seems to be very important. I can show you. Yeah. - Is this what you mean? - Ah. Look like some sort of map. Or a set of instructions of some sort. What about the lights and the rays coming out? It's the light of truth. "When the seal of God is broken, the light of truth will ignite and reveal itself. To the true believer." Ramirez, you okay? We heard the shots. Everything all right? Gordon, you're going to have to continue the mission without me. Ramirez, are you okay? Don't worry, Gordon. I've got you covered. Roger that, Ramirez. Roger that. Ah, Neo-Chrome's on the mainframe. That's some serious trouble. I think Ramirez is out. I'm sorry to hear that, Gordon. Let's do her proud, shall we? "This is a message to all the true seekers. The final three letters that conclude the account of creation. God created us to do. Together spell the word truth. Truth is everything from the cradle to the grave Only the righteous child have access to the path of the Indochine. Be aware. This message will self distract after you read it. The righteous man must answer three questions." Are you ready for this? - I'm ready. - "Question one. What is on the mind of the seeker on his quest for truth?" Honesty and honor. "The path of the Indochine has been revealed. Question two. What is the motivation of the righteous man?" True love. "From the cradle of life, the Indochine comes alive. Question number three. What is the ultimate power of the universe?" - Uh... - One more time. "What is the ultimate power of the universe?" Faith. "The grave at the end of life. The Indochine is lowered into its place and it begins the process of resurrection. The beginning is the end and the end is the beginning from the cradle to the grave, and the rest is up to you." He's coming and he's very hungry. - Who's coming? - The shark. Don't worry, little princess. There are no sharks around here. Are you sure? Who did all this? You did. You made the entire 3D-S mainframe universe possible. Seems like you placed yourself into your own creation as a little boy. We need to get out of here now. Let's get back to the elevator. Run, run! The shark's coming. Let's go! Let's get in here! Why don't you go ahead? Go, go, go, go! Gordon, come on, let's go! Gordon! Hurry, hurry, Gordon! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Sergeant Vargaz? Sergeant Vargaz, come in. The life sign's gone. Hey, this way. Hope you know where you're going, kid. This way. - You sure? - Pretty sure. No one's ever been here before. - You designed it. - I haven't actually yet. This kid's getting smart on us. Come on. This way, this way. Hey, Tomlin. I gotta tell you something. - Hey, what is it? - Ah. Look, not, not a lot of things scare me. You know. Like being married, you know. That's one of 'em. Tight places, tight, tight places, Small places. They scare me. Small spaces, tight places, tight places scare me. You know. I respect you telling me, Gordon. - Yeah. - But you told me only way to victory is to face your fears. Take a deep breath, okay. - Yeah, okay. - You can do this, buddy. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Move, move, let's go, move. Move, kid. What was that? I hope that's not what I think it is. Oh shit. The walls. The walls are moving in! Crap! Move, move, move! They're moving in! - Come on! - The walls are moving in! Go, go! Come on! Go, go! Come on, they're closing! Let's move! Come on, move, move! Go! Get out of here! All of you, move! Get out of here! Here we go! Come on! I can't hold it! Come on! Give me your hand! Come on. Give me your hand, Gordon! Minnesota, help me! Come on! Come on! You get out of here. I can't hold it! I'll hold it for you! Goddamn! It's too late. Goddamn toothpick. You save private Hendy. You save private Hendy for me. No! Dammit! Gordon was a good man, Tomlin. He was a good man. I'm all right. Okay. It's okay. Hey. It's this way. That's what the hieroglyphics showed. This must be the cradle of life. That's where the Indochine is. Look, I'll be right back. You guys stay right here. Okay? You never know what might be out there. Hey. Be careful. All right? That's some big light bulb. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Tomlin! Tomlin! Tomlin, oh my God! Tomlin, come on, we gotta go! The walls are falling! Come on, Tomlin! Hurry, Tomlin! Let's go! Tomlin, Tomlin, Tomlin! Oh my God, Tomlin! Well, it looks like you guys are gonna have to finish this one without me. You did good, Minnesota. You did real good. Thank you. Hey Tomlin, listen to me. You don't let her go. Okay? I promise. I promise. Good. Hey you guys, look out, Neo-Chromes! Get out of here, get out of here, go, go, go, go, go! Hurry, Tomlin! To your left! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Minnesota! Come on. Let's go. Let's go, let's go. Okay. Keep going. Don't look back. Where does this lead to? You tell me. We made it. That's the elevator below us. Smart kid. Where are we going? Well, according to your own program, we're going to the top of the tower. Hold on. Hold on tight. All right. Ready? Yeah. Whoa! All right, kid? I think so. - You sure? - Yeah. The grave at the end of life. That's it. The end of all things, I guess. Huh. From the cradle to the grave. Emily? Emily? Not gonna screw up anything by doing this, kid? I guess we'll have to find out. Rest is up to you. Thanks for your help, kid. Thanks for everything. We couldn't have done it without you. I hope you save Melanie. The end is the beginning. The beginning is the end. The end is the beginning. The end is the resurrection. The light of truth is the re-birth of life. Go. From the cradle to the grave. The beginning is the end. The end is the beginning. It is the cradle of life and death. Go for it. Put it in the cradle! You did it. It's working. You have no idea who you're messing with. I will kill you. We're through here. Kill them. Kill them both now. Mr. Tomlin, I don't know what to say, but a miracle has happened. Not only has the virus been stopped and defeated, it's been completely eradicated. Why don't you come down to the hospital as soon as you can? Hey sweetie. Hey, sweetie. I Love you, Melanie. I love you too.
