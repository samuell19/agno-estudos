HELLO. MY NAME IS MARTY DiBERGI. I'M A FILMMAKER. I MAKE A LOT OF COMMERCIALS. THAT LITTLE DOG THAT CHASES THE COVERED WAGON UNDERNEATH THE SINK? THAT WAS MINE. IN 1966, I WENT DOWN TO GREENWICH VILLAGE IN NEW YORK CITY... TO A ROCK CLUB CALLED THE ELECTRIC BANANA. DON'T LOOK FOR IT. IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. BUT THAT NIGHT, I HEARD A BAND... THAT, FOR ME, REDEFINED THE WORD "ROCK 'N' ROLL." I REMEMBER BEING KNOCKED OUT BY THEIR... THEIR EXUBERANCE, THEIR RAW POWER AND THEIR PUNCTUALITY. THAT BAND WAS BRITAIN'S NOW LEGENDARY SPINAL TAP. SEVENTEEN YEARS AND FIFTEEN ALBUMS LATER, SPINAL TAP IS STILL GOING STRONG, AND THEY'VE EARNED A DISTINGUISHED PLACE IN ROCK HISTORY... AS ONE OF ENGLAND'S LOUDEST BANDS. SO IN THE LATE FALL OF 1982, WHEN I HEARD THAT TAP WAS RELEASING A NEW ALBUM CALLED SMELL THE GLOVE... AND WAS PLANNING THEIR FIRST TOUR OF THE UNITED STATES IN ALMOST SIX YEARS... TO PROMOTE THAT ALBUM, NEEDLESS TO SAY, I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE... TO MAKE THE DOCUMENTARY... IF YOU WILL, ROCKUMENTARY... THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE. I WANTED TO CAPTURE THE SIGHTS, THE SOUNDS, THE SMELLS... OF A HARD-WORKING ROCK BAND ON THE ROAD. AND I GOT THAT. BUT I GOT MORE. A LOT MORE. BUT, HEY, ENOUGH OF MY YACKIN'. WHAT DO YOU SAY? LET'S BOOGIE. ♪♪ GIVES ME A LOT OF ENERGY. MAKES ME HAPPY. HEAVY METAL'S DEEP. YOU GET STUFF OUT OF IT. THE WAY THEY DRESS, THE LEATHER. WHICH ONE IS THIS? IS THIS La GUARDIA? NO, THIS IS J.F.K.

I UNDERSTAND, NIGEL, YOU AND DAVID ORIGINALLY STARTED THE BAND, UH, BACK IN... WHEN WAS IT, 1964? BEFORE THAT, WE WERE IN DIFFERENT GROUPS. I WAS IN A GROUP CALLED THE CREATURES, WHICH WAS A SKIFFLE GROUP. I WAS IN THE LOVELY LADS, AND THEN WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER... AND SAID, "MIGHT AS WELL JOIN UP, YOU KNOW." SO, WE BECAME THE ORIGINALS. RIGHT. AND, UH, WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR NAME, ACTUALLY. THERE WAS ANOTHER GROUP IN THE EAST END CALLED THE ORIGINALS, AND WE HAD TO RENAME OURSELVES. THE NEW ORIGINALS. YEAH. THE NEW ORIGINALS. AND THEN THEY BECAME... THE REGULARS. THEY CHANGED THEIR NAME BACK TO THE REGULARS, AND WE THOUGHT, "WE COULD GO BACK TO THE ORIGINALS, BUT WHAT'S THE POINT?" WE BECAME THE THAMES MEN AT THAT POINT. ♪ STOP WASTIN' MY TIME ♪ ♪ YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT ♪ ♪ YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED ♪ ♪ OR MAYBE YOU DON'T ♪ ♪ DO I HAVE TO COME RIGHT FLAT OUT AND TELL YOU EVERYTHING ♪ ♪ GIMME SOME MONEY ♪ ♪ GIMME SOME MONEY ♪♪ YOUR FIRST DRUMMER WAS, UH...

HE DIED IN A BIZARRE GARDENING ACCIDENT SOME YEARS BACK. IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS. IT WAS, YOU KNOW, THE AUTHORITIES SAID, "BEST LEAVE IT, YOU KNOW, UNSOLVED, REALLY, YOU KNOW." AND HE WAS REPLACED BY... STUMPY JOE. ERIC "STUMPY" JOE. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO "STUMPY" JOE? WELL, UH, IT'S NOT A VERY PLEASANT STORY. BUT, UH, HE DIED. HE PASSED ON. HE CHOKED ON... THE OFFICIAL EXPLANATION... WAS HE CHOKED ON VOMIT. AND HE PASSED AWAY. IT WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE ELSE'S VOMIT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO REAL... THEY CAN'T PROVE WHOSE VOMIT IT WAS. THEY DON'T HAVE FACILITIES IN SCOTLAND YARD. THERE'S NO WAY TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH. YOU CAN'T DUST FOR VOMIT. HERE WE GO. SOHO, THEY CALL IT. SOHO. SO WHAT? HOW ARE YA? IAN. HI, FELLAS! HOW YOU DOIN'?

CHRISTINE? OKAY, RIGHT OVER HERE. GOOD! GOOD! HE'S NOT INTO NEGRO MUSIC. NO, I DON'T EAT THAT SHIT. GUYS, YOU LOOK GREAT. I MEAN, YOU LOOK FANTASTIC. YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW YOU'RE ALMOST 40.

NOW, WE HERE AT POLYMER, WE'RE ALL LOOKING FORWARD... TO A LONG AND... AND FRUITFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH SPINAL TAP. WE WISH THEM GREAT SUCCESS ON THEIR NORTH AMERICAN TOUR. AND SO SAY ALL OF US, "TAP INTO AMERICA." EXCUSE ME. ARE YOU READING YES, I CAN? YEAH, HAVE YOU READ IT? YEAH. BY SAMMY DAVIS, JR.? YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT THE TITLE OF THAT BOOK SHOULD BE? YES, I CAN... IF FRANK SINATRA SAYS IT'S OKAY. 'CAUSE FRANK CALLS THE SHOTS FOR ALL THOSE GUYS. DID YOU GET TO THE PART YET WHERE SAMMY'S COMIN' OUT OF THE COPA, AND IT'S ABOUT 3:00 IN THE MORNING AND, UH, HE SEES FRANK. FRANK'S WALKIN' DOWN BROADWAY BY HIMSELF. FUCKIN' LIMEYS. WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT USED TO THAT WORLD. YEAH, YEAH. FRANK SINATRA. IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST PEOPLE LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, THEY GET ALL THEY WANT, SO THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, ABOUT A LIFE LIKE FRANK'S.

A MINOR BUMP WE'VE GOT TO IRON OUT HERE IS WHEN DO WE GET THE ALBUM RELEASED? I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD THE PRESS IS OR WHAT THE STRINGERS... WELL, AS I EXPLAINED LAST NIGHT, WE'RE NOT GONNA SATURATE THE NEW YORK MARKET. NOW, PHILLY NOW. THAT'S A REAL ROCK 'N' ROLL TOWN. I'VE BEEN ASSURED THAT THE ALBUM WILL BE AVAILABLE... ALL THROUGH THE PHILADELPHIA METROPOLITAN AREA. YOU ARE HITTING THAT MARKET, REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG WE'RE IN NEW YORK. WE'RE CERTAINLY... I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN. YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT BLAMING YOU. BUT YOU DON'T FEEL THAT THESE GUYS HAVE AN AFFECT ON AN AUDIENCE? I MEAN, KIDS GO TO THEIR CONCERT, THEY HAVE A GREAT TIME. BUT IT'S, UH, IT'S A PASSING THING.

REGARDING INTRAVENOUS de MILO. "THIS TASTELESS COVER IS A GOOD INDICATION OF THE LACK OF MUSICAL INVENTION WITHIN. "THE MUSICAL GROWTH RATE OF THIS BAND CANNOT EVEN BE CHARTED. THEY'RE TREADING WATER IN A SEA OF RETARDED SEXUALITY AND BAD POETRY." THAT'S NIT-PICKING, ISN'T IT? THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SPINAL TAP. "THIS PRETENTIOUS, PONDEROUS COLLECTION OF RELIGIOUS ROCK PSALMS... "IS ENOUGH TO PROMPT THE QUESTION, "'WHAT DAY DID THE LORD CREATE SPINAL TAP... AND COULDN'T HE HAVE RESTED ON THAT DAY TOO?'" I NEVER HEARD THAT ONE. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. THE REVIEW YOU HAD ON SHARK SANDWICH, WHICH WAS MERELY A TWO-WORD REVIEW, JUST SAID, "SHIT SANDWICH." UM... WHERE'D THEY PRINT THAT? WHERE'D THEY PRINT THAT? THAT'S NOT REAL. YOU CAN'T PRINT THAT. ALL THOSE ARGUMENTS ABOUT TOURING AND NOT TOURING AND ALL THAT. I MEAN, IT'S OBVIOUS WE BELONG ON TOUR, YOU KNOW? I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT YOU BEING TOO OLD AND BEING TOO WHITE. WHAT ABOUT THE ALBUM, IAN? THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM. IT'S BEGINNING TO BE A REFRAIN. THERE'S NO WAY TO PROMOTE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST. THAT'S A VERY UNIMPORTANT REASON. IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE JUST EXPERIMENTING WITH, UH, WITH SOME NEW, UH, PACKAGING MATERIALS. LET ME GET THE DOOR. DO THEY HAVE MONKEYS OPENING IT? OH, THERE'S... THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE BOSTON GIG HAS BEEN CANCELED. YEAH. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT A BIG COLLEGE TOWN. HEY, I HEARD YOU BOYS. YOU GOT AN ALBUM COMING OUT OR ANYTHING? SMELL THE GLOVE. IT SHOULD BE OUT... SMELL THE GLOVE. SMELL THE GLOVE. YEAH. YEAH. - IT'S A PROVOCATIVE TITLE. - WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE COVER. VERY PROVOCATIVE, INDEED. BOBBI, CAN I TEAR YOU AWAY FOR A MOMENT? DO YOU HAVE A DRINK? I DON'T REALLY NEED ONE. BUT, UM, LISTEN. I REALLY DO HAVE TO TALK TO YOU A BIT ABOUT THIS... IAN, JUST TELL ME WHATEVER'S ON YOUR MIND. THE ISSUE OF THE COVER. YEAH. WE, UH, I MEAN, WE FEEL, AND IT SEEMS TO BE FACTS, THAT, UH, THE COMPANY'S RATHER DOWN ON THE COVER, IS THAT THE CASE? YES. YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT. LISTEN. THEY DON'T LIKE THE COVER. WELL, THAT'S CERTAINLY STRAIGHT. THEY FIND IT VERY OFFENSIVE AND VERY SEXIST. WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU FIND OFFENSIVE? IAN, YOU PUT A GREASED NAKED WOMAN ON ALL FOURS... WITH A DOG COLLAR AROUND HER NECK AND A LEASH... AND A MAN'S ARM EXTENDED OUT UP TO HERE... HOLDING ONTO THE LEASH AND PUSHING A BLACK GLOVE IN HER FACE TO SNIFF IT. YOU DON'T FIND THAT OFFENSIVE? YOU DON'T FIND THAT SEXIST? THIS IS 1982! THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S 1982. GET OUT OF THE '60s. WE DON'T HAVE THIS MENTALITY ANYMORE. WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE COVER THEY WANTED TO DO. I DON'T CARE. IT WASN'T A GLOVE, BELIEVE ME. THIS IS SOMETHING... YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR BOYS ABOUT. WE'RE NOT LAYING DOWN ANY CONDITIONS. I DON'T THINK A SEXY COVER... IS THE ANSWER FOR WHY AN ALBUM SELLS OR DOESN'T SELL. BECAUSE YOU TELL ME... THE WHITE ALBUM? WHAT WAS THAT? THERE WAS NOTHING ON THAT GODDAMN COVER. EXCUSE ME. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS AFTER. HELLO. OH, HI, DENIS. UH-OH. OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM? OKAY, HOLD ON ONE MINUTE. IAN, IT'S ETON-HOGG. HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU, DARLING. YOU'RE WELCOME, DEAR. HELLO, SIR DENIS. HI. HOW ARE YOU? OH. FUCKIN' POOFTER. BUT... BUT IT'S REALLY NOT THAT OFFENSIVE, SIR DENIS, COME ON. OKAY. I'LL CALL YOU ABSOLUTELY FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. OH, SHIT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE ALBUM... BECAUSE THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT THE COVER IS SEXIST. SO WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING SEXY? I MEAN, THERE'S NO... SEXIST! OKAY, LISTEN. I WANTED TO TELL YOU THIS, AND I WAS HOLDING BACK BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT DENIS' DECISION WAS GOING TO BE. BUT AT THIS POINT, BOTH SEARS AND KMART STORES... HAVE REFUSED TO HANDLE THE ALBUM. THAT OLD ONE, HUH? THEY'RE BOYCOTTING THE ALBUM ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COVER. IF A COMPANY'S BEHIND AN ALBUM, IT CAN SHOVE IT RIGHT DOWN THEIR THROATS. MONEY TALKS AND BULLSHIT WALKS. AND IF THE FIRST ALBUM WAS A HIT, THEN WE COULD HAVE PRESSED ON THEM, THEN WE COULD HAVE TOLD THEM, "YES, LET'S..." EVERY CUT ON THIS ALBUM... I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT THE ALBUM SAYS. IT WAS A JOKE. A LONG TIME AGO. NOW THEY'RE MAKING IT LIKE A BIG DEAL. IF WE WERE SERIOUS AND SAID SHE SHOULD BE FORCED TO SMELL THE GLOVE, THEN YOU'D HAVE A POINT, BUT IT'S ALL A JOKE, ISN'T IT? WE'RE MAKING FUN OF THAT SORT OF THING. IT IS AND ISN'T. SHE SHOULD BE MADE TO SMELL IT, BUT... NOT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE THING IS WE CAN PROBABLY WORK SOMETHING OUT. I'LL TALK TO DENIS AND MAYBE WE CAN COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE... AND A NEW DESIGN CONCEPT THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH. YOU GUYS WERE SCHOOLMATES? WE... WE DON'T... WE'RE NOT UNIVERSITY MATERIAL. WHAT'S ON YOUR FINGER? IT'S MY GUM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IT ON YOUR FINGER? I MIGHT NEED IT LATER. PUT IT ON THE TABLE. THAT'S TERRIBLE. NO. I MIGHT FORGET IT ON THE TABLE. HOW OLD WERE YOU GUYS WHEN YOU MET? CAN'T TAKE HIM ANYWHERE. EIGHT YEARS OLD. EIGHT OR NINE. YOU WERE EIGHT, AND I WAS SEVEN. THAT'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT? DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST SONG YOU GUYS EVER WROTE TOGETHER? "ALL THE WAY HOME," PROBABLY. "ALL THE WAY HOME"? YEAH. CAN YOU REMEMBER A LITTLE BIT OF IT? I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT. CHRIST.

ONE THING THAT PUZZLES ME, UM, IS THE MAKEUP OF YOUR AUDIENCE. IT SEEMS TO BE PREDOMINANTLY YOUNG BOYS. WELL, IT'S A SEXUAL THING, REALLY. ASIDE FROM THE IDENTIFYING THAT THE BOYS DO WITH US, THERE'S ALSO, LIKE, A REACTION TO THE FEMALE... OF THE FEMALE TO OUR MUSIC. WHAT DO YOU THINK? REALLY, THEY'RE QUITE FEARFUL. THAT'S MY THEORY. THEY SEE US ON THE STAGE WITH TIGHT TROUSERS. WE'VE GOT, YOU KNOW, ARMADILLOS IN OUR TROUSERS. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY QUITE FRIGHTENING, THE SIZE, AND... AND THEY RUN SCREAMING... IAN, CAN I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU FOR A MINUTE? YES, OF COURSE. WHAT? THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS WITH THE ARRANGEMENTS BACKSTAGE. WHAT EXACTLY? WELL, NO, I MEAN, THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS HERE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START. SOUND CHECK? WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS. LOOK. THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH... LOOK. THIS. THIS MINIATURE BREAD. IT'S...

WELL, NO, THEN IT'S HALF THE SIZE. NOT THE BREAD. YOU FOLD THE MEAT. THEN IT BREAKS APART LIKE THIS. NO, YOU PUT IT ON THE BREAD LIKE THIS. BUT IF YOU KEEP FOLDING IT, IT KEEPS BREAKING. WHY KEEP FOLDING IT? EVERYTHING HAS TO BE FOLDED, AND THEN IT'S THIS, AND I DON'T WANT THIS. I WANT LARGE BREAD, SO THEN I CAN PUT THIS... RIGHT. SO THEN IT'S LIKE THIS, BUT THIS DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S ALL... BECAUSE IT HANGS OUT LIKE THAT. WOULD YOU BE HOLDING THIS? I WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT THAT IN MY MOUTH. ALL RIGHT, EXHIBIT "A."

HE'S TIED DOWN TO THIS TABLE, UH-HUH. AND HE'S GOT WHIPS, AND THEY'RE ALL SEMINUDE. KNOCKIN' ON 'EM. WHAT'S YOUR POINT? MY POINT IS IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN SMELL THE GLOVE. HE RELEASES THAT, AND HE'S NUMBER THREE. BECAUSE HE'S THE VICTIM. THEIR OBJECTIONS WERE THAT SHE WAS THE VICTIM. OH. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IF THE SINGER'S THE VICTIM, IT'S NOT SEXIST.

HELLO, CLEVELAND! HELLO, CLEVELAND! YOU MUST HAVE MADE A WRONG TURN. WE GOTTA GO ANOTHER WAY. OTHER WAY. OTHER WAY. I HATE TO KEEP HARPING ON THIS, BUT I THINK THE NOTION OF A BLACK ALBUM HAS CURSED US IN A WAY. WE'RE GETTING SOME VERY SUBSTANTIAL REPORTS OF AIRPLAY. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THE ALBUM HAD BEEN MIXED RIGHT. NO USE CRYING OVER THAT. OF COURSE, THAT'S TRUE. IT JUST WASN'T... IT WAS MIXED ALL WRONG. IT WAS MIXED WRONG? WERE YOU THERE? SHE'S HEARD THE RECORD. OH, SO YOUR JUDGMENT IS IT WAS MIXED WRONG. YOU COULDN'T HEAR THE LYRICS. YOU DON'T AGREE? NO, I DO NOT AGREE, NO. WELL, I THINK MAYBE...

OH, COME ON. CAN I HAVE THE FLOOR FOR A MOMENT? BECAUSE I'VE GOT SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU. THESE... JEANINE'S BEEN WORKING ON THESE VERY HARD. I'VE GOT NEW IDEAS FOR A NEW PRESENTATION. THE STAGE LOOK OF THE BAND, FASHIONED AFTER THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC. I THOUGHT WE NEEDED A NEW PRESENTATION. THIS IS A LOOK FOR VIV. HE'S A LIBRA. THERE'S THE YIN-YANG LOOK. THIS IS NIGEL. HE'S CAPRICORN. SORT OF A GOAT LOOK. GIVEN YOU A LITTLE BEARD. IS THIS A JOKE? EXCUSE ME. IS THIS A JOKE? JUST BEAR WITH US FOR ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. THIS... I LOVE THIS. I WISH I WERE CANCER. THAT'S ATTRACTIVE. THIS IS YOUR CRAB FACE. GIVE IT A CHANCE. GIVE IT A CHANCE. DAVID, WAIT, PLEASE. WAIT A MINUTE. HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT IT WILL COST... TO DRESS UP THE BAND AS ANIMALS? IT DON'T COST NOTHING. THEY'RE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC. IT'S A WAY TO FIGHT THE DRABS. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT THE DRABS. THAT'S TRUE. I THINK MINE WOULD LOOK BETTER IN DUBLY. OH, SHUT UP! ALL RIGHT, IF YOU'RE NOT QUITE OPEN-MINDED ENOUGH. THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO OUR PROBLEMS. I THINK WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. I'VE YET TO HEAR THEM. WE CAN TAKE A RATIONAL APPROACH. WE CAN SAY... I'VE GOT A SUGGESTION. LET'S HEAR YOUR SUGGESTION. STONEHENGE. STONEHENGE. WHAT ABOUT IT? BEST PRODUCTION VALUE WE'VE EVER HAD ON STAGE. WE HAVEN'T GOT THE EQUIPMENT. WE HAVEN'T GOT STONEHENGE. PLEASE. PLEASE. JUST A MOMENT. NO PROBLEMS MUSICALLY. WE GO RIGHT ONSTAGE, AND IT'S QUITE SIMPLE. YOU KNOW, IAN CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS. WE DON'T HAVE THAT PIECE OF SCENERY ANYMORE. I KNOW, SO WE BUILD A NEW ONE, AND THIS IS IT. CONSIDER IT DONE. YOU'RE JUST GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT LIKE THAT? YOU'RE GOING TO FIND SOMEONE TO DESIGN IT USING THAT AS THE PLANS? LET'S TRY. IF YOU CAN DO IT, I'LL DO THE NUMBER. DO YOU FEEL THAT IN COLLABORATION WITH DAVID... THAT YOU ARE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF MUSICALLY... THE WAY YOU WOULD LIKE TO? I THINK I DO, YOU KNOW, IN MY SOLOS. MY SOLOS ARE MY TRADEMARK. THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. IT'S THE RIGHT PROPORTION. IT'LL BE THIS COLOR, RIGHT? YEAH. THAT'S JUST TERRIFIC. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THE REAL THING. GOT IT. YEAH. WHEN WE GET THE ACTUAL SET, WHEN WE GET THE PIECE, IT'LL FOLLOW EXACTLY THESE SPECIFICATIONS? I MEAN, EVEN THESE CONTOURS AND EVERYTHING? I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU. THE ACTUAL PIECE? - WELL, WHEN YOU BUILD THE ACTUAL PIECE. - BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU ASKED FOR. WHAT? THIS IS THE PIECE. THIS IS THE PIECE? YES. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THIS IS IT? THIS IS SCENERY? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO STONEHENGE? THE TRIPTYCHS ARE 20-FEET HIGH. YOU CAN STAND FOUR MEN UP ON THEM. I WAS ASKED TO BUILD SOMETHING EIGHTEEN INCHES HIGH. LOOK. THIS IS WHAT I WAS ASKED TO BUILD. EIGHTEEN INCHES. RIGHT HERE. IT'S SPECIFIED. EIGHTEEN INCHES. I WAS GIVEN THIS NAPKIN. FORGET THIS. FUCK THE NAPKIN! IN ANCIENT TIMES... HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE DAWN OF HISTORY, LIVED AN ANCIENT RACE OF PEOPLE... THE DRUIDS. NO ONE KNOWS WHO THEY WERE... OR WHAT THEY WERE DOING, BUT THEIR LEGACY REMAINS. HEWN... INTO THE LIVING ROCK...

THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF STONEHENGE... BENEATH THE HAUNTED MOON. FOR FEAR THAT DAYBREAK... MIGHT COME TOO SOON. I DO NOT THINK THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE BAND WAS DOWN. I THINK THE PROBLEM MAY HAVE BEEN... THAT THERE WAS A STONEHENGE MONUMENT ON THE STAGE THAT WAS IN DANGER... OF BEING CRUSHED BY A DWARF. ALL RIGHT, THAT TENDED TO UNDERSTATE THE HUGENESS OF THE OBJECT. I THINK YOU'RE MAKING TOO BIG A THING OUT OF IT. MAKING A BIG THING OUT OF IT WOULD'VE BEEN A GOOD IDEA. NIGEL GAVE ME A DRAWING THAT SAID 18 INCHES. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHETHER HE KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEET AND INCHES IS NOT MY PROBLEM. I DO WHAT I'M TOLD. BUT YOU'RE NOT AS CONFUSED AS HIM, ARE YOU? I MEAN, IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO BE AS CONFUSED AS NIGEL IS. IT'S MY JOB TO DO WHAT I'M ASKED TO DO BY THE CREATIVE ELEMENT OF THIS BAND, AND I DID. THE AUDIENCE WERE LAUGHING. SO IT BECAME A COMEDY NUMBER. YES, IT DID. IT FUCKING WELL DID, AND IT WAS NOT PLEASANT TO BE PART OF THE COMEDY ONSTAGE. BACKSTAGE, PERHAPS IT WAS VERY AMUSING. MAYBE WE JUST FIX THE CHOREOGRAPHY, KEEP THE DWARF CLEAR. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SO THEY WON'T TROD UPON IT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE. I THINK IT'S SYMPTOMATIC OF TAKING ON MORE... THAN YOU CAN, UH, HANDLE. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE MESSED THINGS UP, IS IT? I MEAN, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GAPING HOLES IN THE BUSINESS END, THIS... EXCUSE ME. THIS IS A BAND MEETING, RIGHT? ARE YOU HERE FOR SOME REASON? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. SHE'S WITH ME. IS SHE NOW IN THE BAND? IS SHE SINGING BACKUP OR SOMETHING? I CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BAND. SHE'S WITH ME. DAVID, WHENEVER A SINGLE BUMP OR A RUFFLE COMES INTO THIS ADOLESCENT FANTASY WORLD... YOU GUYS HAVE BUILT AROUND YOURSELF, DON'T KNOCK IT. YOU START SCREAMIN' LIKE A BUNCH OF PONCEY HAIRDRESSERS. I MEAN, IT'S JUST A PROBLEM, YOU KNOW? IT GETS SOLVED. IT DOESN'T. YOU CAN'T LIVE IN A BUBBLE. IF IT GOT SOLVED, THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT. BUT IT DOESN'T GET SOLVED. I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED OUT THERE? - WHAT GOT SOLVED TONIGHT? - FOR ONE THING THAT GOES WRONG, ONE SINGLE THING, A HUNDRED THINGS GO RIGHT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SPEND MY TIME DOING? WHAT? I SLEEP TWO OR THREE HOURS A NIGHT. THERE'S NO SEX AND DRUGS FOR IAN, DAVID. YOU KNOW WHAT I DO? I FIND LOST LUGGAGE. YES. I LOCATE MANDOLIN STRINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF AUSTIN. WE'VE SEEN YOU DO IT. I "PRISE" THE RENT OUT OF THE LOCAL HEBREWS. THAT'S WHAT I DO. GET SOMEONE ELSE TO FIND LUGGAGE, AND CONCENTRATE ON WHAT'S GOING ON ONSTAGE. YOU'D LIKE ME TO BE ROAD MANAGER? NO. ALL BAD BLOOD ASIDE... NO. COULD WE... WHAT DAVE IS TRYING TO SAY, IF YOU'D LET HIM GET A WORD THROUGH, IS YOU COULD MAYBE DO WITH SOME HELP. SOME HELP? MANAGING THE BAND. IT'S THAT CLEAR. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE ALREADY IN THE ORGANIZATION. WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY INSURANCE. WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY EXTRA ROOM, ETCETERA. SINCE SHE'S ALREADY HERE, SHE'S ALREADY AMONG US. - AND SHE'S PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF TAKING OVER. - "SHE"? WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. WHO DO YOU THINK I'M TALKING ABOUT? I WOULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED IN A MILLION YEARS THAT IT WAS HER YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. - WHY NOT? - I AM OFFERING TO HELP OUT HERE. NO. YOU'RE NOT OFFERING TO HELP OUT. YOU'RE OFFERING TO COMANAGE THE BAND WITH ME. IS THAT IT? YES. IN SO MANY - WORDS, THAT IS EXACTLY IT. I'M CERTAINLY NOT GONNA COMANAGE WITH SOME GIRL JUST BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND. "GIRLFRIEND," IS IT? YOU COULDN'T MANAGE A CLASSROOM FULL OF KIDS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING MANAGING A BAND. WHY DON'T WE JUST... LOOK. I... I... THIS IS MY POSITION, OKAY? I AM NOT MANAGING IT WITH YOU OR ANY OTHER WOMAN, GOOD. RIGHT. ESPECIALLY ONE WHO DRESSES LIKE AN AUSTRALIAN'S NIGHTMARE. SO FUCK YOU. FUCK ALL OF YOU. FUCK YOU TOO. BECAUSE I QUIT, ALL RIGHT? THAT'S IT. GOOD NIGHT. CAN I RAISE A PRACTICAL QUESTION AT THIS POINT? ARE WE GONNA DO STONEHENGE TOMORROW? NO, WE'RE NOT GONNA FUCKING DO STONEHENGE! OKAY, WE'RE ALL SET. THANK YOU.

YOU SEE, SATURN'S IN THE THIRD HOUSE, AND IT'S A BIT ROCKY. BUT BECAUSE VIRGO IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY INTELLIGENT SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC, WE'RE GONNA PULL THROUGH THIS WITH GREAT APLOMB. YEAH. HAS SOMEONE NOT GOT ONE? IT'S SO CLEAR, IT REALLY IS. NIGEL HASN'T GOT ONE. WE GOT PAGES FOR YOU. HE'S GOT ONE. HE'S GOT IT. HAVE A LOOK AT THIS. THINK ABOUT WHAT A JUMBLE A TOUR BOOK USUALLY IS. HE DOESN'T WANT IT? HE'S GOT ONE. OH, HE'S GOT ONE? WHAT I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IS THAT DENVER... HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DAVID OVER THE YEARS? HAS IT CHANGED IN ANY WAY? NOT REALLY. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GROWN UP, BUT REALLY IT'S NOT... NO. NOT REALLY. WE FEEL LIKE CHILDREN MUCH OF THE TIME, EVEN WHEN WE'RE PLAYING.

AM I LOSING MY MIND? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS HAS TO DO WITH ANYTHING. WE'RE VERY LUCKY, IN A SENSE, THAT WE'VE GOT TWO VISIONARIES IN THE BAND. YOU KNOW, DAVID AND NIGEL ARE BOTH LIKE... UH, LIKE POETS... LIKE SHELLEY OR BYRON OR PEOPLE LIKE THAT. THEY'RE TWO TOTALLY DISTINCT TYPES OF VISIONARIES. IT'S LIKE FIRE AND ICE, BASICALLY. MM-HMM.

KEEPS YOU A CHILD... THAT IS, KEEPS YOU IN A STATE OF ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT? NO. NO. I FEEL IT'S MORE LIKE GOING TO A NATIONAL PARK OR SOMETHING, AND THEY PRESERVE THE MOOSE. AND THAT'S MY CHILDHOOD UP THERE ONSTAGE, IS THAT MOOSE. SO WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING, YOU FEEL LIKE A PRESERVED MOOSE ONSTAGE? YEAH. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE CLASSICS. I BELONG TO A GREAT SERIES... IT'S CALLED "THE NAMESAKE SERIES"... OF CASSETTES. AND THEY SEND YOU THE WORKS OF FAMOUS AUTHORS DONE BY ACTORS WITH THE SAME LAST NAME. SO I'VE GOT DENHOLM ELLIOTT READING T.S. ELIOT ON THIS ONE. INTERESTING. I'VE GOT DANNY THOMAS DOING "A CHILD'S CHRISTMAS IN WALES," BY DYLAN THOMAS, AND NEXT MONTH... IT'S McLEAN STEVENSON READS ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. TREASURE ISLAND, I BELIEVE. THAT'S INTERESTING. THAT'S FASCINATING. THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING... THERE'S SHORTER WORKS OF WASHINGTON IRVING... READ BY SOMEONE CALLED DR. J. OH, THAT'S JULIUS IRVING. THERE YOU GO. KEEPING WITH THE SERIES. YOU LIKE THIS? IT'S VERY NICE. IT LOOKS LIKE HALLOWEEN. THIS IS MY EXACT INNER STRUCTURE DONE IN A T-SHIRT. EXACTLY MEDICALLY ACCURATE. SEE? SO, IN OTHER WORDS, IF WE WERE TO TAKE ALL YOUR FLESH AND BLOOD... TAKE THEM OFF. THIS IS WHAT YOU'D SEE. IT WOULDN'T BE GREEN, THOUGH. IT IS GREEN. SEE HOW YOUR BLOOD LOOKS BLUE? YEAH, WELL THAT'S JUST THE VEIN, THE COLOR OF THE VEIN. THE BLOOD IS ACTUALLY RED. OH, MAYBE IT'S NOT GREEN. ANYWAY, THIS IS WHAT I SLEEP IN SOMETIMES. DENIS ETON-HOGG, THE PRESIDENT OF POLYMER RECORDS, WAS RECENTLY KNIGHTED. WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HIS KNIGHTHOOD? THE SPECIFIC REASON WHY HE WAS KNIGHTED WAS FOR THE FOUNDING OF HOGGWOOD, WHICH IS A SUMMER CAMP FOR PALE YOUNG BOYS. UH-HUH. DAVID ST. HUBBINS. I MUST ADMIT, I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY WITH THAT NAME. IT'S AN UNUSUAL NAME. WELL, HE WAS AN UNUSUAL SAINT. HE'S NOT A VERY WELL KNOWN SAINT. OH, THERE ACTUALLY IS... THERE WAS A ST. HUBBINS? YES. THAT'S RIGHT. YES. WHAT WAS HE THE SAINT OF? HE WAS THE PATRON SAINT OF QUALITY FOOTWEAR. YOU PLAY TO, PREDOMINANTLY... PREDOMINANTLY, A WHITE AUDIENCE. DO YOU FEEL YOUR MUSIC IS RACIST IN ANY WAY? NO. OF COURSE NOT. NO. NOT AT ALL. WE SAY, "LOVE YOUR BROTHER." WE DON'T SAY IT REALLY, BUT... WE DON'T LITERALLY SAY IT. WE DON'T LITERALLY MEAN IT. NO. WE DON'T SAY IT. NO. WE DON'T BELIEVE IT EITHER, BUT... BUT WE'RE NOT RACISTS. THAT MESSAGE SHOULD BE CLEAR. WE'RE ANYTHING BUT RACISTS. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GROWN MUSICALLY. YOU LISTEN TO SOME OF THE RUBBISH WE DID EARLY ON. IT WAS STUPID. AND NOW WE'RE... YEAH. I MEAN, A SONG LIKE "SEX FARM"... WE'RE TAKING A SOPHISTICATED VIEW... OF THE IDEA OF SEX AND MUSIC. AND PUTTING IT ON A FARM. IF I WERE TO ASK YOU YOUR PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE OR YOUR CREED, WHAT WOULD THAT BE? HAVE A GOOD TIME... ALL THE TIME. THAT'S MY PHILOSOPHY, MARTY. I BELIEVE VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING I READ, AND I THINK THAT... IS WHAT MAKES ME MORE SELECTIVE THAN SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING. DO YOU HAVE A PHILOSOPHY OR A CREED YOU LIVE BY? WELL, PERSONALLY, I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT SEX, DRUGS AND ROCK 'N' ROLL. YEAH. IF YOU WERE TO HAVE SOMETHING WRITTEN AS YOUR EPITAPH? "HERE LIES DAVID ST. HUBBINS"... AND "WHY NOT?" THAT SUMS UP YOUR LIFE? NO. IT'S THE FIRST THING I COULD THINK OF. OH, I SEE. YEAH. IT DOESN'T SUM UP ANYTHING, REALLY. I'M A REAL FISH NUT. I REALLY LIKE FISH. WHAT KIND OF FISH? WELL, IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU HAVE COD. I LIKE COD, AND I LOVE TUNA. THOSE LITTLE CANS YOU'VE GOT HERE... TUNA FISH... I LOVE THAT. NO BONES. YEAH. IF YOU COULD NOT PLAY ROCK 'N' ROLL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? I'D BE A FULL-TIME DREAMER. PROBABLY GET A BIT STUPID... AND START TO MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF IN PUBLIC, 'CAUSE THERE WOULDN'T BE A STAGE TO GO ON. PROBABLY WORK WITH CHILDREN. AS LONG AS THERE'S SEX AND DRUGS, I CAN DO WITHOUT ROCK 'N' ROLL. I SUPPOSE I COULD WORK IN A SHOP OF SOME KIND... OR DO FREELANCE SELLING... OF SOME SORT OF PRODUCT. A SALESMAN? A SALESMAN, LIKE, MAYBE IN A HABERDASHER... OR MAYBE LIKE A CHAPEAU SHOP OR SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, "WHAT SIZE DO YOU WEAR, SIR?" AND THEN YOU ANSWER ME. SEVEN AND A QUARTER. I THINK WE HAVE THAT. SOMETHING LIKE THAT I COULD DO. DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE HAPPY DOING SOMETHING... "NO. WE'RE ALL OUT. DO YOU WEAR BLACK?" SEE, THAT SORT OF THING I THINK I COULD MUSTER UP. DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE HAPPY DOING THAT? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE THE HOURS?
