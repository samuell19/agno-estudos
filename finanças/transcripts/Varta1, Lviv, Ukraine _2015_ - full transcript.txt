On February 18, 2014, activists of the Kyiv Euromaidan begin a "peaceful advance" on the Parliament. Police forces attack the protesters. People are killed, wounded, arrested. Riot police launch an anti-terrorist operation and storm the Maidan. The Trade Union building on fire. The subway is shut down. During that night activists in Lviv storm and occupy the Regional State Administration, Regional Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State Attorney’s Office, National Security Service office, Internal Troops unit base and 4 Police offices. According to the police, 1189 firearms and 13 thousand rounds of ammunition are stolen. Police unofficially limits its activity in the city. On February 20 people are killed in Kyiv. The old regime disappears. A peer-to-peer digital radio channel “Varta1” is created at the beginning of Euromaidan to coordinate drivers willing to patrol Lviv. Starting February 19, Varta1 and other self-defense groups unofficially take over law enforcement functions. This will continue for a couple of days. Varta1, can everyone hear? What’s the situation in Lviv? It’s raining on Volodymyr the Great Street. We’re aware that it’s raining on Volodymyr the Great. It’s just to ease the tension. Plus one vehicle, where should we go? Are there any immediate hotspots? Please let us know. Four in a vehicle, ready to defend. Where should we go? Naukova Street. 3 people with a dog, where should we go? Guys, let’s agree on this. If someone wants to help, then he goes out and helps. Goes to the spot nearest to him. If a dangerous situation occurs, then… Please, understand that you have to patrol your own district. You know everyone there, and if there are suspicious individuals, you’ll be able to question and identify them. When you patrol other districts, everyone is suspicious to you. Dear colleagues, my advice, if you’re patrolling, then not on a main street, because a lot of vehicles circulate on main streets. Drive into courtyards, where there may be dangerous things. Guys, how safe is it to pick someone up, whom you don't know, have never seen? And even more, three, when you’re alone in the car? Think about that. I think that in Lviv it’s safe. Don’t think some shady person will get in your car. We’re all after the same thing. Guys, I have a proposition. Tomorrow, on all the entrances and exits of Lviv, we organize checkpoints. Then the problem with the interception of vehicles will be solved. Let me reveal a small secret to you: checkpoints are there for a long time now. And people observe vehicles entering the city and check them. Not all entrances have checkpoints! There are none on the side streets. In Riasne district and towards Riasne-Ruske there are no checkpoints. There are 150-200 men at the Hamaliyivka checkpoint. Everything is under control, not even a fly could get through. Is someone from Borshchovychi here? And what should be there? Because I hear from the computer, that some sort of thugs are there. I heard, that it’s a confirmed information. I don’t know, I am checking. You are not checking – you are sitting in the computer. That information was confirmed, because the person lives in Livandovka and saw it from the balcony. I live in Levandivka. It’s all peaceful here. I was there, saw it all and stood next to it a minute ago. What’s happening in the “Santa Barbara” district? Lads, I'm asking again, were there any situations in “Santa Barbara”? Because a guy disappeared. Went to get cigarettes and disappeared. It’s impossible to get lost in ''Santa Barbara''! Down Saksahansky Street a masked man walked with another unmasked one. Ukraine, awake! Tell me, please, in what direction is the masked person on Franko Street running and where from and where to? The person has taken off the mask. That’s it. It’s our man. EU Near the ''Ukraine'' stadium, something is happening. Attention. Regarding the vehicles without plates. There is a suspicion, that the cars are being prepared for a provocation, because at the supermarket “Arsen” on Volodymyr the Great Street a black Mercedes S200 just pulled up, a person got out, left the plateless Mercedes, opposite the church, in the middle of the road, got into a different Mercedes and left. The Mercedes was left opposite the church, at the “Arsen” parking. Please, come everyone who is free or nearby, check it, or, I don’t know, we have to think about what to do with it. People, if a Mercedes is parked there with no people inside, that’s dangerous. Don’t come closer, better contact the security services. Regarding the Mercedes, the one at “Arsen”, I drove up to the person, when he was parking, that is, the person adequately, normally told me, that he is ours, he showed me our walkie-talkie. You should have asked, why he’s parking there without a license plate, and devil knows how and where, if he’s our man. Our people don’t park like that. I think it’s normal, I myself drive without a plate. Just saw a guy with an AK authomatic rifle, plate number ... what number? ... Lviv Everything’s OK, they’re our guys with the AK. How can they be our people with the AK? What the…Why didn’t you detain them? What kind of bullshit is this? Spoke with them in Ukrainian. They asked what, where, how and information on how to get to Lypynskoho Street. I understand, but do you understand why you’re here? There should be no AK's, no guns. Where did they get the AK? I don’t understand at all, what kind of bullshit this is. Vehicle with the AK, contact me, your help is needed. The AK theme is closed. I think everyone understands. You shouldn’t talk about weapons on the air. People, don’t you think that among us, there can be the same sort of thugs, that are mentioned so often? Really, how long can this disinformation be spread? Listen, these undercover thugs can try to infiltrate the group and try to sniff out, no? People, join all kinds of AntiMaidan-channels and explain to them… In the Kharkiv AntiMaidan, there are enough adequate people, the situation just has to be explained to them. Everyone, attention! Those, who carefully listened to the broadcast, this is especially for you. At the lake on Levandovka there are thugs, also thugs on Patona Street! Please, confirm the information regarding the thugs. Thugs or looters? These are different things. Tell me, please. Varta1, right now at the hotel... Who has spread the information, that crowds of people were gathering? Everything here is normal. I have the impression, that I’m hearing a repeat of yesterday’s conversation. They were looking for thugs yesterday in the same place and at the same time. And this went on all day. I feel today will be a continuation. Good luck. Pass on our greetings to the hotel, because it’s the third day you’re going to that hotel, looking for thugs. You can also search on Levandivka, search on Syhiv. There are groups of people walking around, this is Selfdefence, but nevermind, they still have to be checked third day in a row. Well, in that case block the messages, or the profiles of the people, who disseminate such information. If I say that yesterday I banned 150 persons, who spoke about it, and anyway they were looking for them all day. In the evening I stopped banning them again. There is already an official statement on the Internet, regarding fake news about thugs staying at the “Eurohotel”. What thugs? What are you talking about? All city entrances are covered, everyone would know. Everyone is playing games using walkie-talkie. On Horodotska Street the entrance to the city is open, no checkpoint, nothing. People, understand one thing, Lviv is not a city for thugs, and there are lots of messages, and who’s coming, and how they’re coming, nothing ever confirmed, only two-three people is not a fact, and we shouldn't spam the air with this. I just called Zaporizhia, great panic in Zaporizhia, because they think, that all Westerners went there and they are all waiting for the Westerners, even though not even one bus has departed for Zaporizhia. Syhiv. Incredible crowds of people. There is confirmed information that it’s clear in Syhiv. Not a soul. Because in Syhiv there’s nothing for even thugs to do. “Epicentre”, everything quiet there? Because from the window we hear explosions, can’t tell where they're coming from. I am tracking the aircraft of Yanukovych, at the moment he’s already flying over Georgia. Shpytalna Street 1-2 checked. There was a crowd of young people, drunk. As I approached, they scattered, scared by the sound of the walkie-talkie, and dispersed quietly in all directions. Thanks to everyone, the issue is resolved. Attention, people, I’m asking everyone to focus and observe the ATMs of the Liviv region, because all sorts of lootings are happening. In case of the detention of a looter, take him to the office 210 at the city hall. Murovane, almost 50 unknown persons. People, some information. Those who live in regional centres, smaller cities. There are many people of uncertain appearance walking around. We just detained two men from another city, Electronic system for the sale of seized goods they were walking about, looking at buildings and cars. Last night cars were broken into, a recorder was stolen. We just detained them, took their information, handed them over to the cops. So create local… even in minimal villages, create something, even if it’s only two-three men, so there is some sort of minimal patrol. Because there was just a situation, we detained people, well, for now we took down their information, released them. Because the times right now… Be on guard, be alerted. A group of 30-40 men left from the Roman Catholic church. They’re moving down the Zaliznychna Street. Can't understand, who is this? They say they’re our people. Frankivsk district, ''Vatican''. Someone from there? Varta1, advise me, please. A person on Khutorivka Street drunk, says nothing about who he is, what he… What to do with him? The ambulances don’t respond to such calls. The person has nothing, no documents, no phone. Blank! The ambulance won’t come, don’t even hope. I’m a doctor and know such cases. What should we do with the drunk on Khutorivka? I won’t take him in my car, because he’s covered in mud, rolling around in a puddle. What should we do? This drunk got up on Khutorivka, but he has no idea which direction to go. Folks, this is an operational channel, for danger notifications. Those that threaten the health of our population, our city and not for the fixing of I don’t know whom. Guys, deal with drunks autonomously. Drunks on a Saturday are a normal thing, by morning there will be thousands of them. Don’t mention it on air, unless it’s something very urgent. A driver has been detained on Zelena Street. He’s in a state of alcohol drunkenness. Smell from his mouth. Drives inadequately. BE HAPPY! CREATE THE GOOD! Cut off a Fiat, rammed him, we have a small accident. But he’s drunk, detained. We have to document this. Dear patrols, sign your protocols with your own signatures. That is: detained so-and-so in this-or-that state. Give it to them to countersign. If they refuse, then note down, that they refused to sign. And pass the documents to the newly-created institutions. Don't give the documents to the police. Better take the money from them tomorrow and donate it to the Maidan. Take them to Naukova Street for chemical tests, if police staff is still there. Deliver them there, the staff will be waiting. Why send them for chemical examination, if everything will be decided through the court? And they’ll want money. Better to take 500 hryvnya or some other sum from them and donate the money to the Maidan. Guys, and tomorrow he’ll hit and kill someone. Oh, you’re playing law abiders here. Deflate the tires and take the car! Park the car aside and deflate the tires, take the keys. He’ll appear tomorrow. Don’t do anything stupid. Don’t take any money. Shut off the car, throw away the keys. Next time he’ll use his head. You have to simply cut the driving license and throw it away. Exactly! Just don’t give them to the cops! Varta, everyone who stops drunk drivers. It’s obligatory to write a protocol. Our patrols accompany the traffic cops, to prevent them from taking bribes. Thank you. “New” Market Varta, has someone seen traffic police posts or seen their patrols around? We’ve driven through half of Lviv and, honestly, haven’t seen a single traffic police patrol. Don’t be a traitor, don’t amuse yourself Police patrols on the circular road? Where? Freedom for nations! Freedom for the human! On Hnatiuk Street there is a traffic police post. A traffic police post near the Monument of Glory, 99. A Selfdefence group sits with them in the car. Traffic police officers in Syhiv without our patrols. Is this normal or not? Sure, it's normal. Let the traffic cops work, but they should automatically behave like humans. Let the traffic cops do their work, they don’t disturb anyone. If they'll work badly, they’ll get their punishment. This is the ''Lions'' group in Vynnyky, working, searching. Excuse me, the ''Lions'' are in Briukhovychy, I always mix up these two names. Hello, this is ''BikeVarta'', Zaliznychy district. Beside the Sknylivskyi bridge we've noticed a grey vehicle with a Kyiv plate, letters KK. There was one person inside. He drove very slowly and said he was simply killing time. Question: why would he want to drive alone, if he could simply stay at home? Did you never drift around in a car? Checked the car that was crossing the Sknylivsky bridge. It’s a person killing time because of family problems. He showed documents, he's a cop. This should have been checked earlier. The cortege going down Horodotska Street was carrying a person killed in Kyiv. Striyskyi park, 20 youths in smokings. Folks, hotel “Voltaire”, a wedding has ended. Some are having no mourning, normal celebrations. Well, that’s their issue, we won’t judge them. But for the people reporting. It is obvious, even to the casual eye, that this was a wedding. Please stop reporting everything you see. Give just concise, confirmed information. Don’t spam the air with every sort of car that did over 80 in the city. Information is more valuable than bread. In Briukhovychy there is a car in the forest, behind the Holoskivsky cemetery. It just stands there, in the forest. Varta, please unban my friend Bandera95. Banned for asking irrelevant questions. We’re driving in another car. Folks, following situation. On Naukova Street, about those two drunks. One is from Luhansk, residence in Zaporizhia. The second has a Lviv passport, driving license issued in Donetsk. Both drunk. A fake lawyer has arrived. “Road Control”, please! Because we’ve been waiting an hour for the police. Sorry, that I did not understood and was such an idiot Someone who can take care of this. Where exactly Naukova, Luhansk and Donetsk? You can’t understand or what? Here is one, two from the East. One from Donetsk, the second from Luhansk. Putin is a dickhead. And in the car they have knives and baseball bats. And some sort of a bag, which they’re hiding. Boys, please, who’s on Naukova, Naukova 49. Go to the examining court, where they took the drunks. See how many people there are. Take the drunks with their Donetsk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhia documents. Disappointment of 2013 - Mayor Sadovy Register, tie their fingers, I don’t know, to their feet. Take to the Regional administration and hand over to the Selfdefence. Davydiv Lions Don’t do... don’t release under any circumstances. Take everything they have, film it. Everything you can do, do it. I recommend taking under control the water wells… of the city of Lviv… the flow of water… into taps… to control. Boys, help, to the “Rukavychka”, a fight! To “Rukavychka”, help to “Rukavychka”... Chornovil Street 103, please, quick. Putler kaputt Demobilization Fall 93 Stryjska, bus station, is there someone? A fight is happening. How many men are fighting? About 14. ATO LOTO state lottery 6-7 men. Varta 1, around LORTA plant two groups are loitering, everyone in black. We want to know, are these people from LORTA or who? Guys, check them. Say “Glory to Ukraine – Glory to the Heroes!”. "What are you doing right now, this evening? What’s your position?" And you’ll know the situation. Well, thank you very much. And maybe you’ll try, while they’re carrying batons? We walked up, asked. But damn, they can say anything you want. How to be sure? Maybe the administration knows. Are they from LORTA, or simply people on their own, or are these some sort of thugs? These can be football hooligans. Guys, can you ask for their documents? Is it that hard? Why are you spamming the air? Approach, ask for documents, goodbye. Folks, don't worry. Fake information can occur. Don't pay attention, but sometimes you have to check. Basically, in the city centre are our people, our Selfdefence, and other groups, everyone carrying sticks. On Volodymyr the Great Street unknown youths with batons, are still here. There are 20 of them. They think, that someone is being hidden inside the gambling machines casino. People and activists, are blocking them, not allowing them to do this and law enforcement personnel is present. Is help needed? What help, there are at least hundred cars. Guys, I’ll tell you. This is becoming a real mess. Somewhere someone saw someone, summoned a bunch of cars. Some do 140 kmph, 15 cars at a red light, they tell so themselves. Others fly in from another district, who knows where from. Lads, we have to either coordinate or we’ll do damage to ourselves. Who knows something about the work of the police? 100% not working. Absolutely. A police car stood all night in Vynnyky, on Hamaliyivka checkpoint there was also another car. Basically, the cops just slept in the car, but that’s cool anyway. Folks, I've just drove through the whole city and there is not even one traffic police car in the city. Regarding the police, if we pay attention to what is written on the Internet, the police hotline 102 is working again. Folks, note down the phone of the regional traffic police. Just met their officers. They said, in case if anything, to call, they will come, but will do so not in uniforms. They’re worried and a bit afraid. So if you want, I can dictate and you can copy down. They’ll come and help as they can. Regarding the cops: cops are also present, but as plainclothes. Met two of them yesterday evening. Folks, in half an hour, at the ''Macdonald’s'', Lypynsky-Сhornovil intersection, there will appear a traffic police patrol. Another will appear at the end of the Horodotska Street near the “Halychavto”, another one on Syhivska Street. And two patrols in the city centre. I really beg all of you to stand by them and work with them, that is to support the guys, so that there are no provocations against them. I’ll be really thankful. In the morning the traffic police post in Hamalivka joined us. We can thank the guys. They stand with us. From them we heard, that until the morning, there was not a single post in the city. Should I tell the number of the accident commissioner of the traffic police? He can register an accident, if needed. The Parliament passed a law about the cancellation of the anti-terrorist operation. The Parliament may vote, the opposition is winning. The Parliament passed a resolution about the withdrawal of troops from the Maidan. Varta Lviv, please, help is needed. Guys, a problem with the car. If I'll stop, I won’t go any further. A disc brake is broken. Tell me, please, where there is a garage to change it, or, please, organize a corridor through the checkpoints, so I can reach Frankivsk. If I'll stop, I'll be stuck. And I have to get to Kyiv. Out on the road you’ll be braking wih your foot? But no, exactly, I don’t brake, you get me? I’m driving in the second gear. Busted a disc, a piece fell off. Understand? If I'll brake, one wheel will jam. Then that’s it, I won’t be able to go anywhere, ever. In Lviv I need some repair service, something, well, like that. I have an Opel Vivaro. Or I can drive to Ivano-Frankivsk. They told me in Ivano-Frankivsk, I called them, they’re waiting for me, if I find nothing in Lviv. But if I stop, guys, that’s it. I’ll be stranded. Travelling from Svalyava in the direction of Lviv. Oh, I don’t know, if I'll stop right now somewhere, it will be darkness. Really, it will be darkness. Truckers can’t help me, they don't have what I need. I’ve alredy stopped and asked, understand? After the disc broke. And now a whole piece has fallen off. Understand? If I'll stop somewhere, my wheel will simply jam. It will lean up against the calipher and that’s it, I won’t be able to do anything about it. And I have no tools with me. Absolutely nothing. I’m driving and the tire is screeching all the way. Screeching to the point... Guys, really, if I'll stop, I’ll really be sleeping with you. A piece of my disc brake has fallen off. Driving to the place of repair. Everything you have in Lviv is closed, I’ve called everyone. Thought of calling Mukachevo, but they’re all closed as well. In Stryi there’s no one, just some truckers, that’s it. My best route is to Ivano-Frankivsk, which is the same as pushing on to Kyiv. And in Kyiv, I have everything I need. Miracle, you’re my best. Forgive me. Fool. I just don’t know what to do, the caliphers plug this hole. Friend, try to stop, and, believe me, you’ll still be able to travel on, because the caliphers won’t jam, if you don’t brake. That’s one thing. Second, the way this Vivaro is rushing to Kyiv is suspicious. I suggest you stop and check it. No problem, boys. I drove from Mukachevo. No problem. If I'll stop, If I'll stay with you, it’ll be your fault. If I'll really stay with you. Pass me on at least to Stryi. I’ll try to stop, and they should try to slow me down by hand. I’ll slow down to the slowest possible speed, and they have to slow me down by hand. Tie a rope to him and tow him! And he wants to drive 600 km like that? What kind of stories he's making up here? That’s what I want. To get onto the Kyiv-Chop highway. I’m from the “Road Control Ukraine”. If you don’t believe me, call the organizers. Call Andrij Ormon, Yuriy Larchenko, Yuriy Torez. Boys, I believe you maintain contact with them. But with a broken disc you’ll hit someone. You understand that very well, don’t you? Be independent. I understand, but I still have to get home, you get me? I have a 4 year old child, well, not four years, four months. My child, understand? I have to get home somehow. Well, we’ll see if we can find something for you in Lviv. Why are you risking your child? The State is the enemy of the people. Guys, we are a large gang. Slow him down. And you from Vivaro, start braking, everyone will help you, don’t worry. If you’re really from “Road Control”. Because you’ve started some sort of “Santa Barbara” here. Calm yourself. Stop. If there’s a problem, we’ll solve the problem, immediately. Weapons to the people! OK, guys, I understand, OK, no fuss, we closed this question. I will stop in Stryi, we will take things one step at a time. Did you help your countrymen? That’s all, I am staying in Stryi. It was seen on Levandivka, near the orphanage. Opposition leaders were A resident called, against citizens shooting the police. a white mini-bus, They believe only the police can shooot people. (None of the cops were punished) guys took an AK machine rifle, couple of guns, one changed into a ''Berkut'' riot police uniform, they got in and left. That’s all. Don’t joke with the armed people in the mini-bus. 102 hotline is working already, call the police, let’s catch them together. Don’t joke with that, the people are armed. Varta1, if you see the mini-bus, just observe it. ''VartaSpec'' on the case. Varta1, ''VartaSpec'' is on air. Please unban Vitaly878. We are listening and analyzing the information. The situation on Stryiska-Naukova. Crowds of people are still gathering here, It is not clear, what I am observing right now. For now there is no one with a walkie-talkie. Oh, Lviv’s city guard is approaching dressed in vests. Now they are deciding on something, I don’t know. Yes, Toyota RAV4, a drunk driver, beside him an even drunker passenger. So what’s going on with the Toyota? Let’s catch it and stop this chaos with those damned alcoholics. This is our city Catch it, take away the driver's license and move on, damn it. Guys, the 2004 Constitution is again in power. 5 buses are moving in the direction of the center down the Victory avenue, they just drove through Svyatoshyno. What avenue? What Victory? Victory Avenue is in Kyiv. At 11 PM Lviv’s Heroes should arrive on the Lviv’s Maidan. A request to come and meet the Heroes. Whoever can, please, come out for 11 PM or preferably earlier. Varta, they will not be brought to Maidan, the parents don’t want it. We've just heard from them. They will be at the Halytsky crossing in an hour. You may drive up to the crossing and meet them there. Varta1, contact the phone number ... There is information about the killed. I repeat, ... The bodies should arrive at 11 PM on Lviv’s Maidan. Information. The bodies of the deceased will not be brought to Lviv’s Maidan. The bus drivers told us so. A request not to discuss this topic any further. Could you please tell where the bodies with the deceased are? Can someone tell me, are the bodies being brought to Lviv’s Maidan? The bodies will not be there. Thank you. Is there contact with drivers, who are bringing our Heroes? Folks, a huge request, don’t go to meet these buses. There is no need to escort them to the Maidan. There are parents, who do not want, that the bodies are brought there. It’s inappropriate and wrong. Respect their will. Please tell me, who has the information on the up-to-date location of the buses transporting bodies from Kyiv? Please respond. At the city entrance. Lots of cars. Information break. We have received the information, that tomorrow, more precisely, today, at 8 AM, Lviv’s railroad workers are planning to block the train tracks of Klepariv cargo station, located on Shevchenko Street 138. Because ore and metal are exported, via that station, well, you know, it's all mostly Akhmetov’s. I emphasize, it's cargo shipments only. Rally at 8 AM, the coordinator - Ivanytsky Volodymyr Vasylovych. One of the workers lost his son and they are a bit fed up. If anyone has the opportunity and a wish, please show up at 8 AM at Shevchenko Street 138, across the “Shell” gas station. Presidential election, September-October 2014. Varta1, an armored vehicle set out to Boncheny. The ''Party of Regions'' has a safe in the Boncheny monastery. The cars are on the road, it is unknown what they are going to take out of the safe. Varta1, to whoever is patrolling the Ivano-Frankivsk district, today at 10.30, a meeting at the OKKO gas station, near the Kulparkiv roundabout. A silver Outlander turned around on Shyroka, it’s coming back downtown. It’s returning back to Horodotska. No license plate. On Konovaltsya Street 80, restaurant “Golden Boar”, four persons are drinking vodka and bragging about their deeds. Could be planted provocateurs. Please come take a look. Came closer and listened. They look and Ukraine’s European choice. Our unity and independence. sound very suspicious. Complete lustration. They say Dignified treatment of the heroes and participants of Maidan and ATO. their commanders Punishment for those guilty of what happened. abandoned them to their fate. People, Kia Sorrento ... drove towards Stryiska-Naukova, what to do? Fuck, trying to catch it for half a day, now seen it near the bus terminal. Guys, it's some ''Berkut'' riot police commander, we need to stop him. Is it the white Kia Sorrento? I get the impression he will drive around until he runs out of gas. Well, actually, he is a cop and can have additional fake license plates in his car. Why is he escaping? He is not escaping, he is just driving. The car is pale-silver, almost white. Well, maybe still try to stop it. It’s not guaranteed, that whoever you are trying to catch is in the car. He could have transferred to a different one. Guys, information was confirmed, that this is a ''Berkut'' commander, I don’t remember… What’s the last name of this commander? Can’t find anything on the Internet about his last name, nothing. Great and how is one car supposed to block him? Guys, Kia Sorrento is over. Pustomyty called, he turned himself in. Last name of the ''Berkut'' commander – Will rent housing Patsylyak, Rostyslav. We did not clarify the last name, but we were told, that he turned himself in voluntarily. Kia Sorrento had a Lviv license plate All clear. Checked the Kia, stupid coincidence, we were told it got pulled over and checked before, no idea who checked it. ''Berkut'' commander is from Novoyavorivsk, he does not own a Sorrento, he has a new Golf. Folks, why are you that scared of that ''Berkut''? Everything is fine, the law got simplified. The law got simplified, but the people did not get simplified. People can get simplified in accordance to the law. People can get simplified, but you cannot simplify “Berkut” and the likes of them. Varta1, Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to the Heroes! People, good news, Yanukovych got caught! Hurray! Fuck, where? In Crimea, brother, in Crimea. Putin is a devil Let’s celebrate, the freak is fucked, sorry! Today is a day of mourning, let’s keep the emotions Moscow is Ukraine to ourselves, please. Great news, but… Where is this information from? Turn 100.8 FM on, he is being transported to Kyiv. Got caught in Crimea or somewhere. Put him on his knees! The news do not mention this, is the information confirmed? Just saw it on Channel 5. Bring Yanyk to Lviv, to Lviv! Take him to the Maidan, to the Heroes! Guys, is the information confirmed? Yes, Channel 5 reported. And 100.8 said they've read it in two sources For real, the TVI site claims he is arrested. And the ''Right Sector'', tells so, TVI writes there is 80% chance it's correct information. The strength of the collective lies in work discipline Black Porsche Cayenne, plate number ..., did more than a 100 on Zelena Street. Everything’s OK, he's one of our people. Yes, ... is an acquaintance. Guys, did you lose your mind? No such thing as one of ours, if he's speeding a 100 on Zelena. Stop him and give us the information. Yeah, the guy is right. Cayenne is one of ours. Those “our people”, the way you call them, speeded to ''Santa Barbara'' and back, across the whole city, for no reason. What’s this? This means rules don’t apply to our own people or what? The law is the same for everyone after all. I guess, Cayenne is one of ours, so he doesn’t give a damn about anyone. Cayenne is fucking speeding 110 down Levytsky Street. Not stopping at red lights at all. 99% chance the driver is drunk. I have crossed paths with him in life, I would not say this in vain. It doesn’t matter if he is rich or not. Right now we are grouping up to catch this Cayenne. And please tell his last name on air. He lives near the ''Dynamo'' stadium, by the swimming pool. Again I repeat, the Cayenne is no secret services man, just some rich boy. The driver of the Cayenne is called Yura. Yura, give up. He is a son of some milk plant’s owner, can’t tell you exactly… Could it be “Halychyna”? And last name ...? No, I know he’s nicknamed ''Sour cream''. Last name of the Cayenne - ... We know where he lives. People are saying they know where he lives. You can tell the address in private or on air, we will write it down. We will let one car wait for him at home. That’s all. And tell us the milk’s brand. We will stop buying it, so he'll no longer have money for gas. It’s house number ..., across the service center. No, he will come there, he will come. Wait a little. Just take it easy, when it comes to the confrontation. Cayenne lives near the sport complex, where the tram turns around, on the right side stands a new high estate. That’s where he lives. Stop there. Yes, the tram turns around there, there is a high building behind. He parks the car on the right side, facing the gate. He and his parents live near the sport complex. He lives near the school number 21. Entrance to the yard, one more entrance, and from the other side is another entrance. Do you have anything other than the Cayenne, thugs and traffic cops? Why are you fixated on him? It was mentioned long time ago that Porsche Cayenne is one of ours. There is no Cayenne in the yard on the ... street. He did not come here. He is probably listening to us and will not show up. …I apologize and admit my error…Well… I won’t do it again… I had a reason… Attention, Varta, we are by the Cayenne, the person admits the seriousness of the situation and comprehends that, well, it was… He really did have important reasons. Well, and he apologizes for the situation. Announce the reasons, please. Amongst them is some family situation, we didn’t press for details. No, no, wait, don’t rush, forgive me for interrupting you a bit. Look, because of such scum, my acquaintance got into an accident. He got hit as he was driving on green. They were speeding on red. That’s why I will not forgive the Porsche Cayenne. I promise you that. I will find him and smack him upside his head for a start. Look, I don’t have the opportunity to drive up, but all those, who were chasing him and are willing, who saw how he was driving, that is he was trying to avoid us, have the full right to drop by and do whatever they find necessary. Besides serious bodily harm and vigilante justice, of course. I'd say, let him compensate for gas to those, who were chasing him. Guys drop him and the Cayenne off at the Hamaliyivka checkpoint, our guys will pull up. I was just going to say the same thing. If he is repenting, that means he admits he is at fault. That means he is ready to receive his penalty. That is called punishment. Let him think, of how he will atone for his fault. I have known him for a long time, and I know he drove drunk many times. Moreover. Please add yourself to a private line if you don’t want the whole Varta1 to show up and punch him. Please, add yourself to a private line and tell as your location, we will come by. We just want to at least talk to him, for now. Look guys, it’s no joke. Why am I saying this? Because, you see, right now we are treating him more or less liberal. But I know the guys from “Road Control”. I know the guys from Varta1 and others. They will not joke around. The Cayenne was deliberately escaping from us. I am asking for one minute of silence. The one who reported and found the Cayenne, please, tell us, where is he now? Don’t drag him to Hamaliyivka, I understand, that there is a lack of people there. People, who started patrolling right now, you better go to the Hamaliyivka checkpoint. You will help our people and you will spend less fuel, if you will just stand there. And this will not make any difference. This would be a real help, because there are not much people there and we need manpower. I am asking for one minute of silence, let them tell where that Cayenne is. Guys, about that Cayenne… One of the reasons we’ve heard, were home circumstances, that had to do with a child. The man is willing… I don’t know how to call it, as a sign of his guilt or you may use another word, that you’d like more, is ready to provide help to our common cause. But maybe not today, because of the circumstances. Thank you for your attention. Was he trying to bribe us? As a gesture of helping our cause. I mean, helping to transport something somewhere. Food… We’d just overthrown Yanukovych and now it all starts anew, yes? No no, it’s very good, that’s what I was asking about. I mean, that’s what he suggested himself, the form of redeeming his fault. Look, if he really can’t right now, we will remember about it tomorrow. As a form of punishment, he will help in the kitchen of Varta and help transporting tea, water, the whole day. OK, maybe with pauses. Or he could stay at the Hamaliyivka checkpoint. Hamaliyivka may not work out, he’d be used as a helping hand, standing there by the side. Or the guys will find work for him. Checking plates, or something like that, but the kitchen must be the best. “Biohacker” doesn’t want to talk, cause I guess he’d put himself in his shoes. Do you have something to do beside Cayenne? Go find something to do, you’re wasting time. What should we do? We do all this, so that the drunks do not run over people. Three people were hit already. Just think about what you’re doing. We are letting everyone go. Finally I’m on air! Thanks! We just want to look into the eyes of the man we were chasing, of that Porsche Cayenne, because of whom we were speeding and burnt a full tank of gas. I want “Biohacker” to tell me, if not on air, than in private, where the Porsche Cayenne or the man are. Please, tell me, I want to come and talk to him. It’s really weird, I mean we are no longer chasing the thugs, this means, the main task of Varta1 is the observation of order in the city of Lviv. If you can ignore the order in Lviv by serving tea and sandwiches, I am ready to spend days and nights, disturbing the order in the city of Lviv. We are forgiving for the first time. Believe me, we have records, we constantly record those things, situations, plates an so on. And it is being archived, meaning if we notice a car for the second time, the measures taken will be completely different. There are hundred thousand or eighty thousand drivers in Lviv. Let us forgive everyone for the first time and we will forgive eighty thousand speeding drivers. If every two-hundredth will run over someone. The number of deaths… Well, it’s hard to calculate right now, but there will be a lot of deaths. From “Torpeda” stadium, down Zelena and Pasichna streets. We were chasing that devil. We drove to Lychakivska Street, because of the false address stated. Where is he? I just want to see him with my eyes, see that bastard, who is driving around drunk and gets away with “personal reasons”. If “Biohacker” won’t tell where he is, I will find the “Biohacker” and punch him, because he is keeping silent. Was the “Biohacker” bribed for not telling or what? Was one of us bribed? Guys, the longer you mess with that Cayenne, the more the people get angrier. I have no idea, what they’ll do to him. Quickly tell us where he is, we’ll go there and solve the situation. Right! Guys, let’s boycott that Cayenne. What’s that? We were standing for this, we were fighting for this, and now they are breaking it all. How can this be? Let us take apart the car and sell it. How can this be? Cayenne is listening to the walkie-talkie. We were driving behind him, he heard us and started escaping. He had no reasons. First he was driving 15 – 20 kilometer per hour. Saw us and… The driver of the Porsche Cayenne was not drunk. The question is closed till tomorrow. Yarka, why is the question closed till tomorrow? Even more, if he was not drunk, why was he speeding that fast? And lots of cars were looking for him. I want to listen to “Biohacker”. Why is he keeping his mouth shut and not going on air? I don’t understand. Was “Biohacker” bribed or what? If he was bribed, we’re going to find him and he's going to get punished. So now he can run over people the whole evening and run the red lights, and tomorrow he’ll be making sandwiches, or what? “Snake”, it’s very right and very good, but look. There is such a thing as coordination and discipline. He was not drunk. This means, that he’ll not continue breaking the rules. This is not the reason to stop him. This is the reason to punish him. That’s why we should continue with our patrolling. Tomorrow he will contact us and start transporting the sandwiches, for a day or two. This also means there will be a serious talk with him. “Elephant”, I do understand what you’re talking about. But do you believe, that he will contact the “Biohacker” tomorrow and start transporting sandwiches? I guarantee you, maybe, 90 percent, that he will ignore it and forget everything we were talking here about. I’m not going to hit him or something. We’re not going to mess with him. I just want to look into his eyes and talk to him, that’s all. This will end the situation. I beg you, for an hour already I am trying to understand, where that shitty Porsche Cayenne is. You get me? Can’t use some other word. “Biohacker”, please, contact me in private, cause if I’ll find you, you will regret it. “Snake”, please, no threats here. I repeat – the question is closed till tomorrow. The man will transport sandwiches and you’ll have the opportunity to look into his eyes and express everything you think about his style of driving. Thank you. And the guys, who died on Maidan, their cause will be postponed till tomorrow? Tell me, what where they fighting for? My friend was killed there. And I will forgive such bastards, that run the red lights while being sober? Because he had some kind of reason. I don’t care! I demand, that someone tells me, were that damn Porsche Cayenne is, and I don’t care, that the question is postponed till tomorrow. That’s all. “Biohacker”, I hadn’t threatened you yet. I am asking you to go on air on your own. Yarka, do you really have the power to postpone things like that till tomorrow or close such questions? “Snake”, I would say “I don’t care” using even harsher words. This is really bullshit. Guys, I’ve told you already. Tell us where he is and that’s it. By the way, tell me, how much does it cost to drive around the whole day with 120 kilometer per hour? How much sandwiches do I have to transport, to be able to drive with 120-130 kilometer per hour? Please, state a number. 25 sandwiches, 30 sandwiches, 40 sandwiches. Now, guys. And you “Snake”. Look. No one has forgiven anyone. I just want to tell this. That Cayenne won’t disappear. You’ll see him tomorrow. Near the house, near Lviv. You’ll find him. Why are you pushing right now, why do you need it now? You’re angry, don’t drive in such a state. People, the question is closed. If there will be any other questions about Cayenne, I will be banning the users. We have his address, we have his number, this means we can find him anytime. Believe me, we have resources for that. Let’s close this question for today. If the man will behave reasonably, we will work with him. If not, tomorrow people will find him and explain everything to him. Guys, my congratulation to everyone with democracy, congratulations, that everyone can express his opinion, congratulations, that anyone can be banned for expressing his thoughts, for having his own principles. They can be banned for that. I truly congratulate everyone. Guys on Maidan were fighting for this. They were fighting for guys, who can now drive around in Porsche Cayenne, speeding up to 120 kmph and getting away with sandwiches. I congratulate everyone once again. I congratulate Yarka and another moderator, who just said this. Maybe he was expressing some clever ideas before, but his last messages were total bullshit. Thanks, Nazar, that you support me. Yarka, as you can see, I can create a new account in no time. But I said it already. Thank you! I see how you are patrolling and what nice administrators we have on the channel. They ban people, who just want to talk to someone, who was speeding around Lviv. You will ban me now, but I will create a new account, no problem. But now I see what our guys were fighting for, I see that our people just don’t get it. But I’ve warned the Porsche Cayenne already, I know he listens to me. If I’ll see him, I will punch him really hard, believe me. I am really disappointed in you. They will ban me now, but why are we standing at the Hamaliyivka checkpoint and guarding the circular road, where there are no pedestrians, if there are guys with Porsche Cayenne’s, who are speeding through the city and they are being forgiven, because they will transport sandwiches? Is this normal? Guys, express your thoughts! Don’t keep silent. Look, once again. For those who didn’t understand it. This is not a channel for expressing your thoughts. Wise people told you, Nazar, “Snake” and all the rest, that the question will be solved tomorrow. You are not alone here. And not only you are the heroes here. You either identify with Varta, and take part in the action, that everyone is participating in for the common good, or you are pushing your own ambitions. Tomorrow they will find, tomorrow they will talk, tomorrow they will punish. Let him transport that sandwiches. Tomorrow! A remark for the moderators. There should be discipline. If he creates a new account, we block him, if he creates another, we ban that one as well. We need a hierarchy, otherwise it will be chaos. Everyone will do as he pleases. This is truly a position of cowards. This isn’t even a position, this is just bullshit. This is my personal opinion. And about hierarchy, about that phrase, that there will be no democracy… What are we actually fighting for right now? Guys, why are we sitting here all nights long? I just can’t understand it and I guess we have to create a new channel, because Varta is not living up to the expectations. Varta is foul for a long time now, in my opinion. Nazar, forgive me, but it’s going foul because of people like you. Because this is a question of reason. First, no one really knew the whereabouts of the Cayenne till the end. If you’d use your brain, you’d understand, that no one knew the whereabouts, except for the “Biohacker”, who didn’t want to go on air. So, you two, youngsters, what were you trying to prove? No one really knew the exact location. Why are you playing heroes here? “Elephant”, let me tell you, there are no youngsters here. I’ve no idea where you’ve heard a youngster. I’ll just say this. We were hit by the same thing we were fighting for. That Pajero didn’t end in anything, a lawyer came and took it. And that’s it. That was the end. We should have done something to it right at the beginning. Who saw a Volga in the Riasne district and asked us to stop the car? We stopped it and now no one needs it. People, we’re on guard from 4 AM. Someone should replace us on the Halytsky crossing, we are dead tired. 400 people are listening to the walkie-talkie, someone should come. Guys, we need replacement on the checkpoint Zubra. There will be no cars left there in half an hour. Same situation in Perfetsky Street. Hamaliyivka checkpoint too. Guys, I understand, that it’s cool to chase cars, it’s cool to look for thugs. But what we really need, is manning the important checkpoints, Zelena, Zubra… Staying there, looking around, if someone is entering our city, there are no volunteers for such things. People, let me know. Dear drivers, let us guard that two locations. Please, don’t leave the checkpoints if there is no one to replace you. The OTHERS can listen to the channel and use the moment. Men, don’t leave the Kulparkivska checkpoint, stay there till the end. We are abandoning the checkpoint at the Halytsky crossing. The Civic support of Lviv told us, there is no need in this checkpoint. We are leaving it. Maybe we’ll return later. But for now we are abandoning it. Varta, especially the ones at the Halytsky crossing. You need to move the barricades just a bit, because there is a huge traffic jam. It’s reaching back to the village of Dublyany. Move the barricades apart, just temporarily, so that two columns of cars can enter Lviv. Everything is under control anyway. Don’t forget, the wounded are being brought here from Kyiv. They need to go without obstacles through the checkpoints and not stand in the jam. We are dismantling the barricades at the Halytsky crossing. Thank you, friend, thank you. Syhiv, free cars. Maybe someone can come to the Zubra checkpoint, there are no people here. Only me. Is there anyone at the Halytsky crossing checkpoint? 15 minutes ago there was no one there. There is no one at the Hamaliyivka checkpoint. A lot can happen in one minute. A shoot-out near the “Millenium” club. Is the broadcast down or is just no one talking? I guess everyone talked enough during that 3 months. Батьківщина там, де висять найважчі хмари
