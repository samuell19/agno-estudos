One night the clock struck twelve The window open wide The age I learned to fly And took a step outside It's time to turn back time Follow the pale moonlight Faith brought me here It's time to cut the rope and fly to a dream Far across the sea All the burdens gone Open the chest once more Dark chest of wonders Seen through the eyes Of the one with pure heart Once so long ago The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me This night will bring him back to me Fly to a dream Far across the sea All the burdens gone Open the chest once more Dark chest of wonders Seen through the eyes Of the one with pure heart Once so long ago Fly to a dream Far across the sea All the burdens gone Open the chest once more Dark chest of wonders Seen through the eyes Of the one with pure heart Once so long ago I wish I had an angel For one moment of love I wish I had your angel tonight Deep into a dying day I took a step outside an innocent heart Prepare to hate me fall when I may This night will hurt you like never before Old loves they die hard Old lies they die harder I wish I had an angel For one moment of love I wish I had your angel Your Virgin Mary undone I'm in love with my lust Burning angel wings to dust I wish I had your angel tonight I'm going down so frail 'n cruel Drunken disguise changes all the rules Old loves they die hard Old lies they die harder I wish I had an angel For one moment of love I wish I had your angel Your Virgin Mary undone I'm in love with my lust Burning angel wings to dust I wish I had your angel tonight Greatest thrill Not to kill But to have the prize of the night Hypocrite Wannabe friend 13th disciple who betrayed me for nothing!
