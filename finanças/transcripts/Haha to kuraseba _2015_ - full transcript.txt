//Songsongsong// ///prayer/// Translation by: shuyingggz Timing & typesetting: amno-s Raw: LoA 9 August 1945, 9:50 am A plutonium bomb was loaded onto a B29 plane It reached the first target, Kokura, but the pilots could not get a clear view, so they changed their direction and flew towards the second target, Nagasaki, instead The commander ordered them not to use the radar for aiming, in dropping the atomic bomb, but by the using their vision, otherwise the operation would be canceled Mother? Mother? Yes What are you doing, Mother? Yes yes Mom? Coming! What is it? Have you taken your medicine this morning? For your low blood pressure Ahhhh I forgot This won’t do; Dr. Yoshida will get angry Okay okay Then, I’m going off, Mom Have a safe trip! Auntie, I’m going off Have a safe trip! Okay~ Signboard; Midwife: Fukuhara Nobuko He’s no longer a kid, but he’s still as rowdy as one Ko-chan’s going to be a doctor soon right? I’m envious~ Don’t be, he’ll be a quack doctor anyway How could you say that! Hey! Please wait for me! Hey, Fukuhara Ah, good morning At that time, the skies of Nagasaki were 70% covered in clouds Just when the commander decided to change his order to a radar bombing instead, the sky suddenly cleared and the streets of Nagasaki were distinctly in sight Don’t take it to heart No, it’s not, don’t mess around He’s here, he’s here! Sit properly! It’s a hot day today too Hey, this is the book I mentioned before Generally speaking, the size of a person’s heart is about the size of their own fist Its shape is similar to that of a peach The heart of an adult is about 300 grams Its weight is proportional to the weight of the person in question, as well as the amount of muscle the person has And also... 9 August 1945 11: 0 2 a.m. I died Nagasaki Medical School was near the core of the atomic bomb explosion About 900 people died, including the teaching staff and subsidiary hospital personnel I was one of them From then on, 3 years have already passed Good morning, it’s Machiko Coming! When I left the house, I took a peek at the hen’s nest and discovered that she’d laid 2 eggs It’s still warm, you see! Wow, I’m glad! Although, is it okay to give them to me? Cracking an egg and placing the tender yellow yolk onto white rice that’s just been cooked Then pouring soya sauce over it Ahhhh, I’m close to drooling! The three of you eat it in peace okay? Please don’t fight over it Let’s go How about the flowers? It’s so hot~ Are you going to visit the grave now? Yes It’s that day again eh? That’s right Stay safe! Okay The Fukuhara grave Auntie, the straps of your clogs are breaking, take them off Alright, thank you Machiko-san? Isn’t it time to give up? What do you mean? I’m referring to Koji A lot of the students who were studying in the same classroom of the medical school together with Koji died, so it’s impossible that only Koji survived It’s just that if he’s really gone, I would have liked Koji’s ashes to be buried together with his father’s for me to pay my respects to But without any proof that that child is dead, I couldn't bring myself to accept his death If I could find something of his, like his father’s Elgin watch, TN: The Elgin National Watch Company was a major US watch maker from 1864 to 1968 or the Onoto pen he so cherished, TN: Onoto was a brand of fountain pen manufactured from 1905 until 1958. People who owned this pen, incl. Natsume Soseki, the foremost Japanese novelist of the Meiji Era or a fragment of his skull or even a shred of the pants he was wearing, I can convince myself to give up any hope I’d thought that way all this while, but I cannot continue thinking like this anymore Instead, I’d like to think that that child has already moved on to another place Even if it’s just his soul, I really wish that he could come visit me But I’ve already given up Machiko-san… Everyone, it’s going to be 11:02 a.m. soon... I can see it in the skies over there The mushroom cloud… It’s such a heinous and despicable act Koji, it’s your favourite, tamago-yaki. Machiko brought it for you To be honest, I plan for this to be the last night that I make any offering meals to you... Which also means that I’ve given up all hope that you might be alive I wanted to see the evidence of your death; before I did, I didn’t want to believe that you died I refused to do any funeral rites for you Your uncle even kicked up a fuss after I’d made my stance clear on this matter But standing before your grave, I told Machiko that I’d already given up She also agreed to give up hopes of your survival, and cried If you were still alive, you and Machiko would be husband and wife… Perhaps she’d even be pregnant now, and I’d have helped to deliver my grandson Ah, I’m saying these kinds of things again and again, repeating the same things over and over Your mother is such a fool May the Lord bless us, it is the Lord’s generosity for giving us such food, Amen Is someone there? It’s me Koji? Are you Ko-chan? Mom, it’s really hard for you to give up huh… Constantly refusing to believe that I died It made me unable to come out and see you I can finally appear to you like this! I see... Mom, did you look for me? Of course I did! From the second day when the atomic bomb was dropped, both Machiko and I went onto the streets of Nagasaki... The streets of Nagasaki… Was basically… Hell... You don’t have to continue… I can roughly imagine how it must have been You went around everywhere; did you manage to find me? I kept thinking that you were still alive, hidden in some place… Kotahira-gu, Mitsuyama, the shrine... Yes, we thought of places where survivors could have gone and went there to look for you For many days... But we could not find you anywhere… What happened to you, Koji? I already told you I waited for 3 years for you to give up any hope of my survival Is that so? Well, you have finally come back to me then Mom, have you been well? When you were missing, I was in such despair… There were many times where I thought of dying in order to see you again, if that was the only way But now, it all doesn’t matter anymore… I managed to live somehow Have you been well? Hmm? There’s no way I could have been fine! I have already died you know Mom, you’re asking silly questions as usual, asking me whether I’ve been well, when I'm already dead You finally laughed eh? There’s plenty of things to be sad about; it’s good to be able to face them with a smile That’s right… Since you were small, you always laughed heartily Father died from tuberculosis… Well, that was unavoidable Brother, who was in university at that time, also died while fighting the war in Myanmar… Now, I’m dead too... Mom, eventually you still ended up all alone… Well, there’s nothing I can do about it. Being able to live is already something to be thankful about After all, the number of families who died in the atomic bomb blast was uncountable... but I was one of the fortunate survivors The house that Father built was also unaffected Mom, you don’t look well. Has Dr. Yoshida been measuring your blood pressure regularly? Dr. Yoshida also died in the atomic bomb blast… But, your father’s friend, Dr. Murai has been taking good care of me so everything worked out... Also, just last month, two families moved in together, and it’s really lively here now Masako’s family, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Fuji had their houses burned down by the blast and thus became homeless… Even though it’s finally quietened down, but the houses and buildings are still severely ruined Fuji-san was also there? Yes How about everyone else? Are you referring to our neighbour, the auntie next door? She’s doing well Everyone staying at that side were safe And the Shanghai uncle carried a backpack and retreated from the war in Shanghai I see… But his son died in the blast so for a while he was depressed But since last year, he suddenly found the energy to live again Because he’s always had good business acumen, the middlemen found his words pleasing to the ears, but plainly put, he’s illegally selling items from the black market… He has helped me a lot in the days after the war I don’t really care about that uncle…! I really just want to know about other people… About who? It should be obvious… Do you mean Machiko-san? Are you teasing me? That girl is well; she’s become a primary school teacher Eh? Machiko? She’s a really adorable teacher you know Machiko is a primary school teacher, you say? Ahhh, her students must be really happy! Her presence brightens the entire classroom! All the kids in her class are surely excited to study and motivated to work hard! There are lines marked on the pillar to measure one’s height... That was created on the 5th of May last year… While busily eating dumplings, what remained unforgettable was the figure of Brother helping me to measure my height… When I took my height again yesterday I was surprised, I was finally the same height as the belt on Brother’s coat Do you remember my homeroom teacher when I was in first grade, Waniguchi-sensei? She was a 50-year old lady who wore spectacles and resembled much like a crab, and she always hit me! “Koji! Why don’t you listen to sensei?” Koji! Why don’t you listen to sensei? Ouch, that hurt! Idiot! Stop running! Stop running! You! Run run run! What are you looking at?! It was really painful! I even bled... Look, you can still see the scar left behind! This child is talkative as always You mean me? That’s right Auntie, good evening! Ah, Takeshi-kun, what’s the matter? My mother… My mother’s complaining that her stomach hurts… That means that she’s already having labour pains, alright, I’ll go over right now Thank you for waiting I want a younger brother Ah, is that so? You don’t like girls? I can see my reflection in Koji-san’s eyes Is the gramophone spoilt? Aiko! Auntie! Is there anything that happened so early in the morning? A child was born at 5 a.m. this morning, in Kosuge Was he healthy? He weighed nearly 4kg! That means you didn’t sleep at all last night… You must be tired This child was crying because he didn’t have an umbrella and would have been unable to come to school I had no choice but to fetch him from his house Aren’t you lucky to have your teacher shield you from the rain with an umbrella Ah! He’s wearing his father’s shoes as well It'd be problematic if an undernourished child were to catch a cold, which was why I told them not to go to school on rainy days… but the children wanted to go to school no matter what These children are so cute! Sensei, hurry let’s go Auntie, please rest well! Sensei, good morning! Good morning Machiko! Where’s your manners! Mom, are you okay? You’re fragile, and yet you’re always doing so many things… Mom, you’re no longer as healthy as before, you need to take care of your health I wanted to become a capable doctor so that it would be easier on you I remember it now When I entered the university, we went to our old house to give our greetings together and the scary uncle was in an unusually good mood He asked me to study hard, get good grades and become a professor, continue researching, and become a Nobel Prize award-winning doctor That’s what he told me But I have no interest in winning a Nobel Prize Rather than research, I wanted to be a clinical doctor Nagasaki has the most number of islands in Japan, yet there are no clinical doctors who could take charge of the patients in these islands It was my dream to give my all in order to help the poor and unfortunate When I told the uncle that, he said “Dreams will not feed you. I didn’t pay for your medical school fees in order for you to help the poor!” I got angry when I heard that, and I told him, “I don’t need you to pay my school fees, I’ll work on my own and pay for it!” It ended up being a huge quarrel, and you had to constantly apologise to others on my behalf “Sorry, it’s my fault for not teaching him well, that’s why he’s grown up to be so selfish.” Mom… Even at that time, you regretted saying those things right? When we came home, you sat on this chair, and you kept staring at father’s photo saying, “It was because you died early, that’s why he spoke to us in that manner. Ahhhh, how frustrating! That ojisan is a silly old man!” TN: Did not translate "ojisan" because she intentionally wanted to refer to him in a rude manner I was shocked then! When did you learn those nasty words to describe him? Nobuko-san! Who is that? It’s me, the Shanghai uncle Please come in This door needs to be fixed You're right I got some miso, it’s wheat miso from Shimabara. There’s also soap; I bought it from the troops stationed there Ahhhh, it’s really fragrant! It’s stupid to be fighting a war with a country who can produce such good things! Oh yes, you also said you wanted gauze right? You need it for your job I haven’t been able to find it, but I finally managed to find a way to get it, please wait for a little while longer You're a saviour, uncle Even though the police have been taking stricter measures, but I don’t have a choice because we need to eat If the black market is illegal, then they should put the country in order so that we don’t have to rely on resources from it to fill our stomachs Are they kidding us... How much should I pay you today? No need for that, I have other means of earning money I can't possibly do that; at least let me pay a fixed amount! Even though fixed prices are of no use because prices are always rising… Well then.. I’ll just take this amount The soap is a present to you. Please help me pass a bar to the young lady as well -- the cute Machiko-chan Thank you. I’m sure she’ll be happy I’ve always wanted to ask you; she will eventually get married right? If you intend for her to be tied to Koji for the rest of her life, it'd be such a waste! No, there’s no such thing... If she finds someone else suitable for her, she can always marry them anytime Then, let me tell you about someone who may be suitable for her He’s a nice guy, but he’s never been to university That said, it is no longer the era where educational qualifications and social status are factors in deciding marriageability Nobuko-san, 3 million youths died in the war. Currently, there is a severe lack of men... It is an opportunity for her not be missed. What do you think? I appreciate your concern, but I don’t think Machiko would want to matchmake Why is that so? It’s just meeting them, if she doesn’t like any of them she can just turn them down But from this point onwards, it is an era of democracy. That child should be able to decide her own future Eh, is that what democracy means? That’s right, two people have to be agreeable with each other in order to get married. I wish that she has that right as well While you’re preaching about high morals, she may already be taken in by bad men harbouring evil intentions “Bad men harbouring evil intentions” Do you mean men like yourself? What?! Ahhh, I’ve been defeated; I’ve been defeated! Nobuko-san is really forthright… I’ll come by again. If there’s anything you need, please let me know anytime Thank you But I was really surprised that I’m a “bad man harbouring evil intentions” Hello! Machiko-sensei Ah, it’s embarrassing to be called “sensei” It doesn't seem that long ago when you just a student yourself Ah, ah Well, the rain has finally stopped! The rain was really strong! Autumn is really the season for long periods of rain Auntie, I came to return the record How was the concert? It was really good! There were over 20 music teachers in the music classroom, sitting in a circle around the gramophone The head teacher belongs to a family of farmers, so he brought steamed sweet potatoes for everyone, saying, “Everyone, please eat the sweet potatoes while appreciating art, but please don’t fart! It’ll affect everyone’s mood to appreciate art.” Everyone laughed really hard It sounds like it was an enjoyable time It’s been a long time since I listened to Mendelssohn. I’m glad to have heard his music again TN: Felix Mendelssohn, was a German composer, pianist, organist and conductor. Notable works incl. Violin Concerto, Wedding March, Songs Without Words That song was one that Koji liked right? Oh, there was something else, Auntie. A short while after the song was played, a teacher suddenly started weeping A female teacher? No, it was a male teacher who came back from the war Later, when we asked him why he cried, he said that on the day he left for the war, he listened to this song in his room He thought that it'd be that last time he would ever hear that song in his life On the battlefield in the south, almost all of his fellow soldiers died He, too, suffered severe injuries, but he was at least still alive, and somehow managed to make it home For someone who didn’t think he would have the chance to listen to Mendelsohnn ever again, hearing the song again made him emotional... After hearing Kuro-chan’s story, everyone cried... Kuro-chan is...? It’s that teacher's nickname Because his name is Kuroda, so the kids all call him “Kuro-chan Kuro-chan”. Eventually, we all called him Kuro-chan as well Kuro-chan held on to his dear life, and came back from the battlefield… What about his family? His mother and younger sister died in the atomic bomb explosion Then... He is living alone? That’s right. This... I’ll go put it back Machiko is really strong! You’re losing again! Not yet! Will you be able to win in the end? As expected, a guy is stronger! Eh? Does Machiko have a person she likes? Yes I do Who is it? We’re only left with this amount of sugar from what the uncle bought from the black market, let’s drink some black tea Ahhh, that’s great! Black tea is much more compatible to have while listening to Chopard and Mendelsohnn as compared to sweet potatoes That's true Auntie, you must have been sitting in this room, all by yourself, for a long time Was it last year or the year before last, I wonder...? Whenever I felt lonely, I’d come to this room, thinking that I could finally see that child... When I was in the kitchen in your house in the evening, I called out “Auntie” but there was no reply I wondered if anything had happened, so I walked into this room. I saw you sitting on the sofa, just like how you are now, in silence Isn’t there a phrase “in the shadows, in solitude”? You seemed just like a shadow, as though you would disappear into the wall when touched I shouted “Auntie!” and you stood up… I thought to myself, “It’s great, she’s still alive!” Such incidents happened a few times… When they did, you always stayed here because you were worried... Even laying on the futon by my side But I always fell asleep before you did, and snored as well Thank you The fact that I am still able to live till today is all thanks to you No, don't say that, Auntie! I couldn’t possibly let anything happen to the mother of the man I love deeply Because I thought that way, so I was always worried about you and visited you often It was also because of that that I managed to keep on living Koji’s already dead… If Auntie were to follow him and die as well, I’d definitely be unable to live That’s why you’re the reason why I’m able to live on too It makes me happy to hear that coming from you But Machiko-san, like I mentioned the other day in front of his gravestone, 3 years have already passed It’s okay for you to give up on that boy now By giving up, do you mean to forget him completely? I can’t… I can’t do that! Didn’t I say this before, Auntie? I want to keep him in my heart, and lead a quiet life for as long as I live But what would Koji think if he hears that? Do you think he'd be happy? He'd surely be happy! Afterall, the two of us… We promised that no matter what, we’d love each other, even in the afterlife Auntie, asking me to give up… How could you say such a thing in Koji-san’s room? Sorry… I’m sorry… Don’t cry… Ma'am... Are you there? Yes? They distributed plenty of sardine fish, they seem to have caught a lot. Take your pot and come quickly to the union office! Yes, I’m coming! Auntie, I’ll go instead Ah, okay. Let’s have dinner together tonight, okay? We can have grilled salted sardines Okay The notice came so suddenly Oba-chan! Yes! Jesus, Mary, Joseph. Bless me to have a peaceful sleep. In the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit, Amen You’re here! Ahhhh, there’s Mom’s smell No matter how old you are, you will always be a child who still wants to sleep with your mother eh? You even kicked up a big fuss in grade 4, because you’d wet your bed Why was it that I always wet my bed regardless of my age, I wonder? It always rains in Nagasaki so the futon refused to dry… It gave me a headache But, you didn’t get mad right, Mom? Even when I wet the bed Was that the case? You don’t know how much that saved me back then... It was so embarrassing, I couldn’t bear it If you had still scolded me back then, I think I would have wanted to die That’s why I told Machiko that no matter how much our kids wet the bed, we’d never scold them The two of you even talked about such things? Yes we did. We even talked about where we wanted our wedding ceremony to be held Really? And…? The ceremony would be held in Urakami Cathedral. Kawakami-sensei from pathology would be the matchmaker We had an issue with what to wear, though... As we were still in the midst of war, I compromised to wearing an old-fashioned khaki hat and clothes But no matter what, I wanted Machiko to wear a wedding dress, just like the kind that always appears in movies; those with pure white lace For music, it will be Mendelssohn, of course TN: Koji is humming the Wedding March, one of Mendelssohn's famous works How is Machiko doing now? You can see me, and yet you’re not able to see Machiko? I don’t see her on purpose. If I do, it'd be very painful... She must be really pretty, as always It’s all thanks to her that I’m still alive, because during the most difficult period, when my head hurt until it felt like it would explode, and when my body was fatigued such that when I climbed up the slope, I have to stop and rest for a few times; neither did I have any appetite, nor was I able to sleep at night… That child came to our house everyday, helping me to cook, and even helping me to clean and do the laundry Back then, I was just an empty shell... She took my place to hand in your death certificate to the government… The certificate of evidence, insurance and even contacting the university… She helped to do all those things Mom, it’s okay to rely on her completely. After all, she is my wife You mean, she would have been your wife… right? Koji… Recently, I’ve been thinking that things can’t keep going on like this What if… What if there’s someone that Machiko likes? A guy she likes? Who is that guy? It’s just a hypothetical situation When that time comes, both you and I have to give that girl up No… That kind of thing… I absolutely do not want that Koji, please calm down and think about it rationally. It’s already been three years since the atomic bomb In that time, that girl has grown into a fine lady Then, does that mean that there’s someone else she likes? I’m not sure if there’s really such a thing but she’s such a gentle girl; it isn’t surprising for a young man to want to marry her If there’s really such a person, then she must have been fooled by him! Machiko may be smart, but she doesn’t know the ways of the world. She must have been taken in by a man with a glib tongue! Koji, that girl is strong and independent. If it’s someone she chooses, he will definitely be someone of a fine character That person is me! The one that Machiko has chosen; that will only be me! Mom… Are you on my side? Or are you actually on the side of some cheap unknown man? I’m the only one for Machiko… Yes… That may be the case… But, Koji… you no longer belong to this world... You have to consider that… No, I don’t want that… I'm not dead yet! I am not dead yet! Koji… Please don’t push us… I have no choice Sorry… Are you okay? Yes... Text: 64th company of the Myanmar force; Matsumoto Shoichi Text: Please donate clothes to returning soldiers. Wives and children are in very difficult circumstances Ota-san Kazami-san, you’re next I am from Tenjin Primary School in Nagasaki, my name is Sata Machiko This student of mine is a child of a soldier and she wishes to know what has become of her father who was dispatched, and that is why we have come here today Tami-chan, your grandfather has told you what to ask? I am a grade 2 student. My father was deployed to war; his name is Kazama Shigeru I have a grandfather, but he’s taken ill and is bedridden, so he told me to bring this letter here, and ask about what has happened to my father That is why I have come here with my teacher Alright Where? The Philippines, right? Your father… Your father… Was deployed to a place called Baguio in the Philippines… He was killed in battle Grandfather told me that if my father had died in the war, I had to ask for where he died and the circum...? The circumstances? Yes... I was told to ask you to write about the circumstances Alright This is the location and the relevant details… I’ve written them down for you. Please pass this to your grandfather Thank you very much Kumiko-chan, you poor thing… Sensei, my grandfather told me… What is it? That no matter what happens, I cannot cry Is that so... I have two younger sisters. Mother is already dead… which is why, I must be strong I must not cry Did the child really not cry at all? I wish she could cry out loudly, because it was just me crying non-stop Why did I accompany her? As a teacher, I was of no help to her. What was my value in being there? I felt really pathetic... Isn’t that good? You accompanied that girl to the veterans office, and cried because of her unfortunate circumstances She must have been glad that you were there Although they were a gift from someone else, I still have some dried flying fish slices. Do you want to have them for dinner tonight? Thank you, but there is a union gathering tonight Koji’s favourite, bellflowers. I saw it for sale, please take it TN: The bellflower is the symbol of unchanging love, honesty, and obedience Bye then! Are you going back now? Yes Koji, how have you been? Since the other day when you left with that sad look on your face, I’ve been worried about you Shall we listen to your favourite record together? Mendelssohn… You listened to it often. The record is almost worn out Menuhin's violin is really wonderful TN: Yehudi Menuhin, was an American-born violinist and conductor. He is widely considered one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century I wanted to become a musician; a conductor Oh? Not a movie director? Was it Itami-san or Ozu-san that you sent anonymous letters to? TN: Both Juzo Itami and Yasujirō Ozu were influential screenwriters and film directors of that time Ah, such things also happened Come to think of it, you also said you wanted to be a novelist; you even fought with your older brother about it Ah, yes yes When he said that being a novelist was a profession of the poor, I got angry And yet, you could never win against him in a fight He’s a Judo second belt; he even has such broad shoulders! His frame resembled Father’s When your older brother came to see me for the last time, he became this thin He came to see you? On the year you entered university, on 9th of April, which was also the day that he was killed in the war Ahhhh, the night when you said he appeared in your dream? Mom, what’s wrong? Your older brother was here… He was right there... What? His beard was this long… That child… He must have died in battle! He must have... Oh, it turns out that Brother came back to see Mom… It must have been because he missed you so much He came to say farewell to me from Myanmar, which is a few thousand miles away; travelling across mountains and rivers, just to say goodbye But why did you never come to see me? Even though you were close by About that… Brother spent countless days in the jungle thinking about you; thinking “I want to see Mom, I want to see Mom.” That was the only thing he thought about But for me, there was no time given for me to say goodbye. I became ashes and smoke in an instant... Even I didn’t even know what had happened myself That’s right, you disappeared suddenly... Sorry for saying strange things... Before he left, Brother looked at me and said “Koji, don’t study the arts, but the sciences, then become a doctor and protect our mother.” His expression scared me, saying it as though it was his last words I had no choice. I listened to him, and applied to Nagasaki Medical School If you entered Medical School, you could postpone your conscription… After you graduate, even if you were called for duty, you would be an army doctor so you wouldn’t die on the battlefield That’s what I thought, so I was relieved... In the end, the outcome was still the same... That’s right… I have no choice… This is my destiny Destiny? If it were something completely unavoidable like an earthquake or a tsunami, it is considered to be one’s destiny… But this was stoppable. It was a tragedy among the plans that humans seek to execute. It isn’t destiny… Don’t you think so? Koji? What’s wrong? Oh, you will disappear whenever you are sad… Koji… Tomatoes in sweet sauce; they were your favourite… It was given by the neighbour Koji? Koji? May God bless us; thank You for Your graces, thank You for blessing us with food. Amen Ah, you’re here? What are you doing? Lighting a candle while offering a prayer... Are you creating an atmosphere? You are such a silly child. There is a power outage because of insufficient electricity. There will be electricity in a while The food is really a plain and simple fare… The duties of a midwife require a lot of physical labour, is it enough to merely have these? Don’t worry, everytime I go over to a patient’s house, they will offer me a meal... Do you want to eat? I can’t eat... Mom, you should be the one eating instead Okay I miss eating the onigiri you make, Mom... Those that had thin pieces of seaweed sprinkled on them You miss eating such food? When we had our lunch break during the sports meet, everyone opened their bento and started eating, but Mom’s onigiri was the prettiest! It was shaped like a triangle, and each vertex was shaped perfectly. It was especially delicious… I practiced how to make onigiri even before I got married I added sesame seeds and salt to the freshly cooked rice, and pinched them just like this The rice was so hot that my hands became red Your grandmother kept scolding me, saying “See, you dropped grains of rice again!” When I was finally able to shape it into a neat little triangle, I felt that I had finally become a woman Grandmother was harsh with her words, wasn’t she? In Nagasaki, we didn’t have to fret about the basics like food and clothes This city allows room for luxuries We even ate champon in Chinatown; that was really delicious... TN: Champon is a noodle dish that is a regional cuisine of Nagasaki. It incl. fried pork, seafood and vegetables, a soup made with chicken and pig bones and ramen noodles When was that? You know… that time when I was caught by the military police because they suspected that I was a spy Auntie, when my Mum reaches home, please help me to tell her that the military police office asked me to go over for a while What happened? I don’t know either, but they suspect that I am a spy Ko-chan is a spy? Don’t say unnecessary things. Hurry and walk! How scary! “You traitor!” After being violently beaten up, they threw me into a small dark room I didn’t know what would happen to me… But Mom, you came to save me... I was so angry to hear that you were accused of being a spy I went to the military police and asked them, “What exactly did my son do?” They said that the base in which anti-aircraft guns were held was captured in the photos that you took at the sports meet They discovered the photos when it was developing in the photo gallery I asked them to show me the photos. I took a firm attitude, and insisted that they let me take a look at it I discovered that in the 16 photos you took, only 1 had captured the base that they were talking about I couldn’t accept their accusation, and thinking that I'd never be able to get through to these lower-ranked soldiers, I demanded to speak to their commander With that, I pressed my way into the commander’s office Mom, you’re amazing! I did all that to save you Just like that, I insisted on meeting the commander, and told him: “It was only in a corner of one of the photos he took that captured a blurry image of the anti-aircraft gun base How can you use such unclear evidence to determine that he is a spy? If he were truly a spy, he would have taken countless photos of the base. My son is definitely not some spy! In fact, he studies very hard in order to give back to the country; he is a subject loyal to the emperor.” After listening to what I had to say, the commander laughed and said “I understand. For your sake, we will release your son." That’s what happened They pulled me out from a room that resembled a prison and brought me into the commander’s office I was shocked to see you there in his office! The commander, who was wearing a golden badge, told me, “If it wasn’t for your mother, you would have become a criminal who leaked his country’s most important secrets... You have a really good mother.” On our way home, we cried as we ate champon, don’t you remember? Ah, such a thing happened too... It made me really angry... Mom, that’s disgusting. You’re drinking your snot as it drips into the soup! What's with your teasing?! For whose sake do you think I went through so much trouble for? Snot-filled champon... If you don’t want to then you don’t have to eat it Ahhhh, delicious Mom, even though you will usually fail at things, and often misunderstand what is happening, which always makes me laugh But in the most crucial moments, I know that as long as I listen to you, I will never go wrong Really? That’s why… About Machiko… After you talked to me about it, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking What have you been thinking about? Well… If Machiko were to be my wife and take care of you all her life, you would live in bliss and I would be happy too... Even though that may be the case, but asking her to do such a thing would be wrong. Like you said, I no longer belong to this world Machiko should just forget about me, and find someone suitable, and if possible, find a person who’s even better than me… Even though I think that there isn't such a person… There’s definitely not! But if… If there really is… No, I don’t think there is, but if there is… Then she should marry him Both you and I will endure the loneliness; that is our way of expressing our love towards Machiko I am not the only one who wants Machiko to obtain happiness, it is also the wish of the tens of thousands of people who died along with me in the atomic bombing Machiko should be happy on our behalf. Isn’t that right, Mom? I didn’t expect you to have considered everything so thoroughly. That’s really admirable. As expected from my son... The lights are back Nobuko-san? It’s me, the Shanghai uncle! Coming! It’s open! Good evening It’s frustrating to have power outage. It’s dark out on the slopes; it feels like ghosts will suddenly appear The radio has been fixed, two of the vacuum tubes needed to be changed Ah, is that so? Oh, there’s sound! I’ve got some good stuff - peanut butter from the garrison troops Look at this - flour, canned pineapple. Applying peanut butter onto steamed cake will be so delicious… I’m drooling just thinking about it Thank you very much. Please accept this money Ah, you can pay me when you have enough No, it’s best if I paid now. How much is it? 300 yen should be fine Then, 500 yen Did you give that cute teacher the soap I gave you previously from the garrison troops? Yes, she was very happy about it and asked me to pass along her thanks Regarding the marriage proposal that I mentioned previously… I have already rejected it. It was made by a rather good family... I’m really sorry about that. Will you have a cup of tea before you go? No, it’s okay. I have to leave for another job now I may have turned down a proposal for that child, but how about yourself, Nobuko-san? Have you… Have you considered remarrying? Me? Yes What are you saying... Please don’t crack such jokes with me I’m serious about it! You’re all alone; you have to find a reliable man who can protect you Then, do you have a person in mind? Yes, I do! Really? Is he a rich man? Well… Although he’s not very wealthy, but he’ll definitely let you live comfortably What kind of person is he? Do I know him? Yes… You’re familiar with this person... Who is it? Well, to put it simply… It’s me Uncle, you’re very good at making jokes That’s right, that’s right! I’ll come by again next time “It’s me”?!? I’m an idiot... Mom, aren’t you going to sprinkle salt to remove unclean spirits? Ahhh, you saw everything? Yes, I saw everything! What was that ojisan trying to do? He doesn’t know his place TN: I kept his usage of "ojisan" because he intentionally meant to refer to him in a rude manner Mom, you too, going along with that thick-skinned ojisan and his low class jokes, and laughing so heartily Don’t let that fellow enter our house! Actually, I knew that he liked me... What? It was only because of his feelings for me that I was able to buy black market goods like sugar and flour at cheap prices That’s so sly of you! It’s not like you to do such a thing… You’re right… Indeed, it is unfair From now on, I will stop buying these goods from the black market But, you know Koji, that uncle is not a bad person... That kind of thinking is naïve! You’re too kind! No, I’m also not some kind of saint In the past 3 years, I have been through a lot of suffering and hardship... I’ve been cheated; the money that I lent to relatives was unreturned, and I was even betrayed by a good friend Even though he is an uncultured man, but in order to continue living in such a chaotic era, sometimes one needs to act impulsively on gut feeling, just like he does If someone really ends up in trouble, he would always tell them, “Let me help you!” But if you are angry about it, then I will stop buying things from him in the future I met with many awful events... But the best quality about that uncle is that he would never betray anyone I understand. But if I see Father, I will report to him that someone proposed to you, and you even laughed heartily, as though you were very happy about it. I’m not going to help you if he gets angry No, how could you do that! I’ll tell him, I‘ll definitely tell him! Stop it! I’ll tell him! Hey, you! Okay! It’s alright, it’s alright. A mother’s intuition is very strong; The desire to raise children will definitely allow breast milk to flow successfully Of course, ensuring that you take in sufficient protein is important, but there's no need to worry unnecessarily over lack of breast milk Okay When you gave birth to Sumire-chan, your milk was as white and silky as a pearl. Isn’t that right, Sumire-chan? But after all, meat was distributed to us at that time... Indeed, times were so much better back then than it is now... But it’s alright, you don’t have to worry Okay Have you decided on the child’s name? Yes, we’ve decided on Machiko. The “machi” in Kagomachi It’s the same name as my teacher: Machiko-sensei Ahhh, is that so Sumire-chan? Are you from Tenjin Primary School? Yes, I am! I know Machiko-sensei very well. How is she? Is she a good teacher? She’s a young and pretty teacher, right? Why are you saying such things again? What is it? I’m telling you, Kuro-chan likes Machiko-sensei! Silly child… This child doesn’t know how to respect her teacher! What kind of a teacher is Kuro-chan? He is tall, and has a pleasant voice Is he good at singing? Nope! Even though he has a nice voice, he always sings out of tune Sumire! I’m sorry, she has really bad manners Machiko, don’t become like your sister Mom. I’m right here Say, your dressing makes me feel nostalgic! Even though it was your older brother’s old clothes, it seems to suit you better Yamaguchi High School’s school song, Song of the South 1, 2, 3 Here we go! Willows flying everywhere; the spring scenery looks embroidered Sore! Facing the river, leaves and branches behind me, I entrust my magnificent aspirations to the clouds Mom, do you remember? You took the steam train with Machiko, who was only a student back then, to visit Yamaguchi High School’s cultural festival What's so funny? At that time, there were many programmes in the hall. The program that seemed the most ridiculous was the Nanyang dance Oh, that… They rubbed black ink all over their body and wore grass skirts, saying “My Lover” As I watched the group dance and shake their hips, I spotted you among them! It was so hilarious because it was such a stupid dance! Do you still remember what happened after that? What happened? I ran to the field to play, with my whole body still covered in black ink The weather was really good that day, and the sun was burning down fiercely Because I have sensitive skin, my entire body was sunburnt “Auntie, quick, come here!” your friend called me over, and so I followed You were beside the well, vigorously trying to wash off the ink on your body. Your skin was sunburnt, and it swelled with redness You were shouting, “It’s painful, it’s painful!” Pour it slowly, pour it slowly! Did anyone bring any burn cream? “Ah! I’ll go take it!” It was really painful! I was severely sunburnt… Everyone came forward to help you apply the burn cream as I held it, putting thick layers of it on your body You were really angry, and had a scary expression on your face Machiko, who was still a student then, was standing not far away from me and laughed till her face was red! I was only wearing a fundoshi then, and was shouting “It’s painful, it’s painful”; TN: A fundoshi is the traditional Japanese undergarment for adult males. Before World War II, the fundoshi was the main form of underwear for Japanese adult males I felt like crying! I thought I was doomed, and that Machiko would dump me. I had no hope of keeping her beside me I just kept sleeping; I didn’t eat, and I even skipped school But you weren’t dumped, right? Not long after, I received a package. It contained a cooling balm. There was also a letter in it... “Have your sunburns gotten better? Hopefully you’ll be able to recover qiuckly after using this medicine... And by the next time we meet, I hope you'll regain the smooth and white skin you originally had, okay?” That was what she wrote in the letter Isn’t that great? I was overjoyed. I was really happy I felt hungry all of a sudden, and I ate to my heart’s content. I was even teased by my friends for it Ko-chan… Don’t cry. Whenever you’re sad, you disappear… Stay and accompany me for a while longer... The nights during autumn are too long Have you talked to Machiko about it? About what? About… About forgetting me Not yet... It must be tough for you to bring it up too… But it’s something that I’ll eventually have to mention… Good evening! Coming! Did you have a guest? No I thought I heard you talking to someone I often talk out loud to myself, like I always do Don’t get a shock, but look! I managed to buy some beans Ah, beans are extremely rare! It's amazing that you were able to get them! I still need to buy sugar… Let’s ask the Shanghai uncle for help to get them Alright Rice cake with red bean soup… If I were able to eat it to my heart’s content, I’d die with no regrets Don’t say such inauspicious things It doesn’t seem like anything good will happen in the future even if I were to continue living Please don’t say such things; it’s unlike you Well, both my sons are dead… I don’t have any other kin as well You still have me, remember? Oh yes, Machiko-san, there’s something I have to tell you... Yes? You don’t have to feel obligated to Koji and I, you know? Someday, you'll find a nice man and build a new family together Auntie, like I said other day… I don’t intend to get married Why is that? Why don’t you want to get married? There’s something that I’ll tell only you, Auntie On the evening of the 8th of August, the day before the atomic bomb explosion, we were on our way home from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ factory in Morimachi, our workplace My good friends Chikako, Tateishi and I parted our ways at Takaracho crossroads like we always do, when for some reason, Chikako’s expression became serious She said, “We don’t know when we might die, so let’s have a proper farewell every now and then.” Hence, we told each other, “Goodbye, see you again tomorrow. Farewell.” After taking deep bows, the atmosphere lightened It was the morning the next day, right? When you had a stomachache and took leave from work On the 9th of August, the roof of the factory collapsed onto Chikako and Tateishi, trapping their movements They cried for help, but they were eventually burned to death by the fire that broke out I previously borrowed a watch from Chikako; it was a wonderful watch made in Switzerland... I wanted to return the watch to her, but I was never able to gather the courage to do so After a few months, I was determined to return the watch and decided to visit Chikako’s house I told her mother that Chikako had lent me the watch, after which she hugged me tightly and told me, “You are safe and sound.” The truth that I had a stomachache that day and took leave slipped... And her mother pushed me away... What happened after that? She kept glaring at me and said, “If only Chikako had a stomachache that day and skived off by taking leave.” Well… I’m sure her mother only made that comment out of extreme grief No, I feel sorry for having lived... Don’t ever say that! No matter what, you shouldn't say such things...! It’s alright, I am Koji’s wife. It’s fine even if I say it No! That absolutely cannot be said...! Koji would definitely be unhappy if he heard you say that... He would have wished that you get married and live a blissful life... That’s why you should find someone suitable for you... There is no such person. Please don’t say weird things anymore...! Please don’t be angry… Remember, didn’t you mention it before too? Your colleague from the primary school, the one who cried while listening to Mendelsohnn… He seems like a nice person Why are you even bringing him up...? Indeed, he's a nice person, but that's all there is to it Sorry, but what if… What if someone you like appears in front of you one day; would you marry him and give birth to many children...? Auntie, please don’t talk about it anymore! Anyway, if you really meet such a person, then you should forget about Koji, and think about yourself more I’m sure Koji would want that as well No, if I betray him, Koji will be angry... He won’t get angry, he definitely won’t. I’m his mother; I know him the best So, please do that, okay...? Machiko-san, are you upset? I need to think about it carefully on my own... Goodbye Mom? Have you told her everything? I did, just like you told me to If someone suitable appears, she should give up on me and be together with that person… You said that, didn’t you? What did she say? She said she’ll think about it, and went home crying... How pitiful… Is that so… She cried…? Koji… Don’t cry! Don’t worry, I won’t cry I can’t bear to let her go too… It feels as though I’m forcibly driving away my own daughter... Mom, get a hold of yourself! You’re… You’re acting like you’ve just had your heart broken You’re right, I shouldn’t dwell on sad things That’s right Afterall, I had to say all those things for her own sake This is Kawakami-sensei. How nostalgic! He really loved to drink alcohol He came to our house before, didn’t he? We even served him alcohol that was distributed in meager amounts, right? The next day, he called me to his research lab. After I went in, he suddenly told me in a loud voice, “Fukuhara-kun, your mother is a real beauty!” That night, we drank and got drunk together. That teacher would always sing whenever he was drunk Is that so? The school song of his alma mater: The green grass of Takeo, the sweet fragrance of the flowers… Eh? I was there… Attending Kawakami-sensei’s lesson… That’s right… Your life ended on 9th of August, during that teacher’s lesson Is that so… How is he...? What happened to him? Even though he was miraculously saved from under all the rubble, his entire body was pierced by glass fragments, just like a magnet attracts magnetic objects. He was covered in blood, and everyone carried him to the shrine Despite the nurses taking care of him to the best of their abilities, he seemed to have foreseen the inevitability of his death and asked if there was any alcohol, so the nurses gave him all the alcohol they had for disinfecting After he drank it, he suffered a painful fit... It turned out that he suffered from lockjaw and masticatory muscle spasm as well... TN: Lockjaw refers to reduced opening of the jaws caused by spasm of the muscles of mastication, or may generally refer to all causes of limited mouth opening That was really excruciating... TN: Lockjaw may interfere with eating, speech, and oral hygiene. It also limits/prevents medical examination/treatments requiring access to the oral cavity Following that, he requested once again for a tube to be stuck down his throat in order to drink alcohol The nurses acceded to his request, crying as they did so. Unexpectedly, it triggered his muscle spasms yet again Kawakami-sensei said with a sad smile, “This still can’t work.” After a while, he passed on... That was the day that we lost the war; 15th of August Koji, do you still remember Yoshioka-san, the nurse? She was the one who relayed that information to me when she came to visit... Yoshioka-san also passed away last spring due to atomic poisoning. She was Christian and a very beautiful girl... Hymn: Heavenly gates, brilliant rays of light... Are you alright? Nobuko-san, what’s wrong? I’m sorry… I should be fine after some rest You’ve been losing a lot of weight recently... Have you been eating regularly? Hymn: Ave, ave, ave Maria... Ma’am, it’s really cold today! You look like you’re wearing pretty warm clothes… Were they left behind by the garrison troops? Yes, look it's "PW". The Americans may be cruel, but they provide their prisoners of war with such good clothing It’s no wonder that Japan lost the war... Yes! Mother, I want to have some snacks... Keep quiet! Hello! It’s me! Oh, it’s you It’s been a long time Are you cleaning the house by yourself today? Usually Machiko will come by to help, but she must be so busy that she hasn’t had the time That seems like a tough job… If I had known, I would have came to help you Let me do it, let me do it. Although a few days ago, I was captured by the police and locked in a cage... By “cage”, are you referring to the police station? Yes, yes. I was betrayed by a lousy friend… What bad luck I have! Are you alright? Don't worry, I’m alright I won’t be fazed by such a trivial thing! I brought some black beans for you, it’s an essential item for dinner on New Year’s right? There’s fishcake as well Well, regarding that… I really appreciate your kind intentions, but… But I’ve decided that I will no longer consume these resources from the black market... Isn’t there a government official who was determined not to buy goods from the black market and who starved to death? There’s someone who was actually so serious about it... I, too, should no longer enjoy such luxuries... Afterall, being a Japanese… Don’t say it as though it’s something inflexible… There are people in this country whose characters are worse than mine. So many more… Please, take these back with you. Even my son has reprimanded me harshly for it He doesn’t approve of me buying these from you... Your son? You mean Koji? Yes He… Isn’t he already dead? He came to me in a dream and told me not to buy resources from the black market... So please, sell these to someone else... If he were still alive, he would say that... But he’s no longer around… Surely, there isn’t a need for you to listen to what he says? I’m really sorry; I cannot accept your kind intentions... I did it to make you happy; I even panted while climbing up the steep slope… I apologise... Oh, yes. I almost forgot a very important matter Koji had a lot of records, right? Do you still have them now? Yes, I do Recently, I’ve been thinking of opening a coffee shop in the neighbourhood, near Shiam Bridge… A music cafe. Beethoven. Apparently, it’s the current craze in Tokyo Can you sell his records to me? I’ll give you a good price There’s no way I can do that. If I sold them, Koji would be angry Angry? You mean the vision in your dream will get angry? Yes, that's right. I greatly appreciate your consideration but I definitely cannot sell the records... I’ll donate them to the university after I die. I’m sure Koji would definitely consent to me doing so Nobuko-san, have you been feeling unwell recently? Why do you ask? It’s best if you went to see a doctor... If you’re worried about the money, I will help you to pay for it Thank you. Koji was always worried about me too Please don’t mention Koji anymore. For now, please take good care of your health Thank you very much I’ll come by again when the New Year opens Koji, I will not buy black market goods anymore… Ma’am Yes? Nobuko-san from the Fukuhara house… Has she been behaving strangely recently? I think so too… She’s been rather restless Uncle, what have you brought with you? Is it something for the New Year? If you're looking for black beans, I have some Ah, that’s great! Come, come in and talk! Hello! It’s Machiko Coming! Auntie, I’m so sorry for not coming to help you with the chores… How are the preparations for the New Year coming along? It’s nothing too lavish; I only did some tidying, and prepared 2 to 3 dishes I’ve made some glutinuous rice… I was making rice cakes at home yesterday It's not much, but please accept it. You can cook them for meals, or use them as offerings Ah, thank you very much It finally feels like the New Year I’m really sorry for not coming for a very long time... At least you finally came. You didn't drop by, so I thought you were angry with me... Is that right? No, I wasn’t angry Machiko-san, would you mind closing the door for me? The wind is too strong… Well… You may be angry at this, but I still decided to bring him here Bring who? Are you willing to meet him? This is a fellow teacher in my school, Kuroda Masakumi-san It’s a pleasure to meet you Auntie… The truth is, the both of us… Are you engaged already? Yes I see… Congratulations to you both Thank you very much Did you specially make a trip here just to inform me? Yes, because he said that he wanted to pay you a visit... Do you know about Koji? Yes, Machiko told me everything Then… Are you willing to meet Koji? Of course Thank you This child is Koji. He was a student at Nagasaki Medical University On the 9th of August… You already know what happened that day, right? Koji, this gentleman is… Machiko-san’s... Ma’am, I’ll chat more with you after the New Year. I bid my farewell for today You are Kuroda-san right? Yes Returning to your hometown after having survived the war, your eyes filled with tears upon hearing Mendelsohnn… That’s you, right? Yes That's good... Kuroda-san, please take good care of Machiko Please help me relay this to Koji-san: "I will treasure her with everything I’ve got for the rest of my life." Thank you very much. I’m sure he will be very happy to hear that. No… I’m sure he’s happy now We’ll get going then, Auntie. Happy New Year; have a good year ahead The same goes for you I’m sorry… I don’t know how I will ever be able to explain this to Koji… It’s okay, it’s okay... Things are fine this way too... Please be happy. Okay? Koji… I’ll keep this photo in the drawer Ah, I’m tired You came! Mom, I watched a movie today Oh? I can enter any movie theatre freely, as I wish Ah, that’s great! English movies are amazing! The images in “Henry the Fifth” have colour! TN: Henry V is a 1944 British Technicolor film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name I think it’s called colour motion technology. Soon, we'll enter an era where movies will no longer be in black and white but in colour Mom, what movies have you watched recently? “Rhapsody in Blue” TN: Rhapsody in Blue is a 1945 fictionalized screen biography of the American composer and musician George Gershwin Nagasaki Main Theatre was packed! I finished watching the film while sitting on the sidewalk That movie was good! Gershwin’s composition of “Rhapsody in Blue” was so wonderful TN: George Gershwin was an American composer and pianist I was engrossed in the music America is really a strange country - on one hand, they’re able to produce such great movies, but on the other hand, they’re able to create atomic bombs as well... Mom, what’s the matter? You don’t look too well To be honest, when you were watching movies, Machiko came to the house… She brought someone else with her... There were two people? You should understand… She came with a man He and Machiko are engaged, so they came to seek my blessing Really... Engaged? She already has a partner for marriage…? Yes, she does What kind of person is he? He suffered injuries from the war, and only has one leg left Even though he has a disability and requires a crutch when he walks, but he is of good character Of good character? In what way? I just know it. I sincerely think that he is a good person. He is a reliable person Since Mom says so, then everything should be fine Machiko will be definitely be happy, won’t she? Definitely… Apparently, he is a primary school teacher and is really popular among the children Then is he an interesting person? Just the opposite; he’s a very serious person, stable and of few words. Unlike you, always talking non-stop… I don’t have to worry if Machiko marries him Am I really that talkative? Yes, you certainly are Whenever you are home, you would be calling “Mom, mom” non-stop for the whole day You will continue calling “Mom, mom” until I reply It felt as though you’d used up your entire life’s quota for calling “Mom” What are you saying, you idiot? What’s wrong? Is it too upsetting? But it’s something you have to learn to endure, because you are a man You thought that I was going to cry again, didn’t you? Don’t worry; I won’t cry I was just thinking, as long as Machiko obtains happiness, I will be happy too I trust your judgement It’s good that you think of it that way. Koji, you are really an good child Don’t worry, that child will surely be happy She is smart and kind; she’ll definitely be a good mother in the future. She will give birth to many adorable children… Why are you crying? She will have a happy and blissful marriage life and one day… She will eventually forget about you, am I right? If that’s the case, then it's good She has to forget about me But… why is it that she is the only who can be happy? If only both of you could swap your roles… Mom! Don’t be like this! Don’t say that. It’s not like you to say such things... Sorry… I’m sorry. I was wrong… Mum is an evil person… An extremely evil person. I am actually jealous of her... Koji? I’m really tired… I’m going to rest now Is that so? Yes, it’s better for you to rest earlier... I feel so giddy... Mom? You don’t look too well… Are you okay? I’m fine Goodnight Please come by again tomorrow, okay? Dear God, I entrust my spirit into Your hands, Amen Goodnight then Mom? Hey, mom? You’re still here? I’ll probably never come again in the future Why? Why is that? That won’t do… Machiko won’t be coming to our house anymore, like she did before, so you can come everyday Ever since you died, nothing could make me happy anymore... I’m begging you… Please don’t say things like you’ll never come again It’ll be fine, Mom Why will it be fine... Even if I don’t ever come back to this house again, we’ll still be together From now on, we'll always be together What? Why will we always be together? Because… Listen, Mom... Because you’re already in the world that I’m in Then… From now onwards, I can be with you forever? That’s right I’m glad! I’m really glad... Come, grab onto my hand tightly Ready? Then, let’s go Nobuko-san? Good evening It’s me, Shanghai uncle; I’ve come again. I’m opening the door! Oh, she’s already sleeping... I’m sorry… but someone brought rice cakes for the New Year, so I thought of sharing some with you This uncle says that you haven’t been well recently and was really worried about your health I bought some braised pork and champon from Chinatown; we have to eat better food for the New Year Nobuko-san? Are you feeling unwell? Please excuse me, I’m coming in… Huh? Nobuko-san? Uncle… It seems like… There’s something wrong… Doctor! I'll go get a doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Nobuko-san? Did you die here all alone? All by yourself… How pitiful… It’s really pitiful…. It’s too pitiful… Hymn: Kyrie, eleison. Kyrie, eleison. Kyrie, eleison. Christe... Let’s go Hymn: Kyrie, eleison. Kyrie, eleison. Kyrie, eleison. Christe... Machiko? Let’s go I have to endure. Endure a breath. Endure countless breaths Oh, breath. Oh, breath. Pass through me. Pass through me, who has lost a place where I belong Sumire-chan? Is the baby well? Yes! Pass through me, who has been released into another world Finale song: The sun will still rise tomorrow morning Translation by: shuyingggz Timing & typesetting: amno-s Fresh flowers will bloom over all the earth; the birds of tomorrow will definitely sing happy songs tomorrow Oh, the earth, the earth. I wish you beauty and feelings of passion forever I’ll be filled with gratitude tomorrow, and pass through that place
