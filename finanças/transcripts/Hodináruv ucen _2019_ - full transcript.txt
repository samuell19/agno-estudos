DEDICATED TO MARTIN KUREL It's a boy! You start. You start. Why me? I started last time. You start today. I said you start. I start with girls, you start with boys. Isn't that what we agreed? Wait, it was the other way around: You've got the boys and I the girls. That's not what we said at all! Maybe you and yourself said that. Then we'll draw. Rock, paper, scissors. One, two... Three, right? I'm starting today, boys. Cross my heart and hope to die. Now you've done it. It's going to be trouble again... Dear... What's his name? Shouldn't you know? Yeah, you always just barge in... His name's Urban. Dear... little Urban, I wish you lots of heartbreak and poverty. May you always be closer to death than life... Your mother will soon be parting from you, -and you will end up in the orphanage... - Just a moment, now... That's enough! That's overdoing it! Have you no sense of pity? No. Dear Urban, may the heartbreak be only momentary. The poverty will be overcome by plenty, and you will get great riches... - Blah, blah, blah. “What "blah, blah, blah"? You will have a kind heart, with love that can win over human malice and even death... Right! No one can win over death. No one. We'll see who's prophecy will be the stronger, yours or mine. You'll be an orphan. An orphan! Here it comes. Ahem, ahem. PRESENT WITH THE SUPPORT OF WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY THE WATCHMAKER'S APPRENTICE STARRING What's that? Stop! Wait here. Sir! What are you doing? Where are you going? 7581... 752... -153... No, 754. - No, 753. - Tut-tut-tut. 754... It's 753. 7585. -156. No, 755! No, no, no it's not! 756! -755! - It's 756. 756. That is gorgeous. Such a treasure! Where did you get it? Mind your own business, OK? - Yeah, quit prying. No touching. - But I'd like to have this treasure! - I'm getting tired of you. - Only one person is getting this gold. - And who? - Urban. - Urban? - Urban. - Don't know any Urban. No? -No. Well, he's exactly the one who's getting it. As soon as your Laura ties the knot. My daughter? - When she's married? - Yeah, now leave us alone and wake up. Sir! Hey, sir! Sir, wake up. Wake up. We're home. Could it be? A coin from the treasure? So it wasn't just a dream. Watchmaker, give me that coin. I have nothing! I won't give you anything, you... You ragbag! I'll give you two for it. Look. - Two, you say? - Good deal, isn't it? I already told you, I have nothing to give you. Just you wait. It must have been a dream. Well then, what do you call this? It could have stuck to your shoe anywhere along the way. At the market maybe. You said you were there, right? Only one person is getting this gold. Urban! And you had sap on your shoe from the broken barrel from the cooper, so with all the pushing and shoving at the market, you can step on a gold coin in no time and not even know it. What did that woman see in this coin that she wanted to trade it? Only one person is getting this gold. Urban! Well, if that's how it is, then let's see this "Mr. Urban" come and get the gold coin from his treasure. Daddy! Daddy, what did you bring me? Off we go. - Yuck, she stinks! An apple. You can pick one from the garden. We have no money to waste. Let go! - And don't distract me right now. - Oh well. And that's that. He will not be a wretch, he'll be rich. Yeah, you came up a bit short there, eh? This means nothing. The watchmaker will be eating out of my hand and my prophecy will be the stronger. - Dummies! - What did you say? Dummies! Hey! Boy! Boy! Stop! Wait! Wait! Stop! Now I've got you. - Give me that. - I... I... - What's your name? - Urban. I... I had a dream and there were these two strange guys who kept saying I would find a gold coin in front of your house, and they told me to go there, so I went. And the coin was really there. I'm hungry, I just wanted to buy something to eat. Alright then. Fine. Urban. At least you explained it all properly. Don't you have any parents? Not anymore. And where do you live then? I lived in an orphanage, but I ran away. No one came looking for me anyway. From this day on, Urban is going to live with us. I am going to take care of him. And I will teach him to be my assistant. There... Right where you belong. I was thinking... whether it mightn't be time to find Laura a groom. And now that Urban Is part of the family, why not him? What? You want to betroth Laura to Urban? They're just children. The sooner Laura has a groom, though, the sooner Urban will get the treasure. And if Urban is the groom, then he will essentially be ours. You get it? And the treasure will be mine. I mean, ours. Oh, so that's what you want. - That dream has driven you mad. - It wasn't a dream. It was a prophecy. There can't be a wedding until the girl comes of age. There are laws for that. Oh, laws, laws, laws. Go to sleep! Good night. Choose a ball. Pick one out. Not with your hand. You have to use this. Now put it in, like that. Where will you put it? July So... Show me, children. That's correct. Now let's write the letter "m". DECEMBER Hurrah! Snow! Try to hit me, Laura. JANUARY Anselm. FEBRUARY Laura? Urban? Laura, shack time. Urban. Where are you? Laura, wait! Wait! Laura! Laura! Laura! APRIL Now... At this moment of celebration, it is my pleasure to announce even more good news. I have decided... That is, we have decided... that our beloved Laura will be betrothed to this, our dear Urban. In other words, our Laura is engaged, Laura and Urban will be getting married. Let the wedding preparations begin! Laura is engaged! And she's going to be married! Laura is going to be married! My dear boy... Go to her and bring her back. Mother, pour the drinks. We shall have a toast. You don't have to marry me if you don't want. I'll tell your father... - No, no... It's you who doesn't have to marry me if you don't want. I had no idea that father would do something like this. He can't just force you into it. I owe him a lot. He gave me an education, a home, he provided for me. Then you should be marrying him, don't you think? But I want to marry you. Because... Because I love you. I have for a long time. You do? I do. But I understand if you don't want me. I'll tell your father... The wedding will be as soon as possible. Now let's see that treasure arrive. Boo. Watchmaker, do you know what time it is? What are you working on? A gift for the newlyweds? What are you doing here again? Get out, or I'll sic the dog on you. Anselm! Anselm! - Anselm! - Anselm! So you threaten me with dogs, and all I did was come to give a friendly warning. What warning? Warning of what? You're going to have a wedding so you can get Urban's treasure, right? What do you know? Has my wife been gossiping again? I don't need old wives' gossip, I know what I know. Urban will get a chest full of gold the day he takes Laura as his wife, but on the day of their wedding, you will die. - Don't believe you. - Don't! But don't be surprised when you hear the wedding bells alongside your own death knell. Let me see you, dear. How magnificent. What do you think, father? I don't know, maybe we've rushed things too much. - If you don't like the dress, just say so. - It's not the dress... The whole wedding, it's all rushed. But you were the one telling the whole town there was going to be a wedding. Exactly! You could have restrained me a bit! Urban will get a chest full of gold the day he takes Laura as his wife, but on the day of their wedding, you will die. Laura! Urban! Lunch! Urban, hand me the pepper. I said salt. You said pepper. I said salt. You said pepper. I said salt! You said pepper. We all heard it. Then I said pepper but I meant salt. Let's not all go crazy! And the wedding will be postponed! And that's that! Hey, I know one. What about the story of the blind rabbi? He had a watch that would chime whenever death was near -and wanted to get him. - And how did the rabbi end up? He died anyway. Oh... He died, but he was at least 250 years old. -250 years old, that's nonsense. - Listen here... When he had the watch on him death could not touch him. - That's right, death couldn't touch him. No, it couldn't. Death feared him. I'm telling you, that watch exists. - I heard it myself! - Yeah, well... Yesterday you said... What was it? There's an idea, eh? You startled me. Of course. Send Urban to find that nonsense, and he's sure to never come back. Not without that watch, at least. You can't lose. Well... That's true... If the watch does not exist... then Urban will never find it and never come back. And if it does exist, and he comes back with it... Then, I guess... I'll take it from him and death will not come for me. Sure thing. - Service! One beer! My glasses... And put it on the gentleman's bill. - Let me go! - Right, Watchmaker? For the advice. No, this will be enough. A watch that warns of death? What kind of nonsense is that? “Where should I look for it? - You'll figure it out. But why? What for? So many questions! It's like this: There will be no wedding until you bring the watch. Only then will I give you Laura's hand in marriage! Now go. -But what about Laura? I have to say goodbye. I'll go in the morning. I don't know where to go anyway. You'll go now. I'll give Laura your warm regards, you're sending a million kisses, and you'll be right back. But... - Don't worry, she'll wait for you. I'll see to that myself, just go, go, go. So... And don't come back without the watch. Anselm. You have to help me, my friend. I love you, Laura. Wait for me. I will return. Urban. There, now go. When the moon comes out in the sky And moves the bright of day aside, I start to worry about you in the darkness. I hide my dreams behind closed eyes, Again and again you softly sigh The name that gives you no rest. Without you my heart is tom apart. My heart is but a part of yours. Love ticks away like a clock's chime. Are we too late, or is there still time? Are we too late, or is there still time? Urban! What an ungrateful brat. We wait on him hand and foot, and he runs off in the night. Like a thief. Without saying goodbye. Maybe he just popped out -and he will be back soon. With all of his things? He's never coming back again. Mother! Good day to you, sir. May I ask you a question? I am looking for a watch that can warn of death. Have you ever heard of such a thing? - No. - You haven't. Fine. Godspeed. - Good day. -Good day. “Would you give me a ride? Out into the world, is it? Into the world, yes, but not gladly. We're going out into the world too. We can walk a ways together. Yes, maybe this way. To the Royal Capital. - The Royal Capital? - Yes, have you never been? - I haven't. What things you will see! - Good thing you met us! - The big city! - Now straight ahead and to the left. - It's not to the left. - It's to the right. - I never go right, always left! Without you my heart is tom apart - My heart is but a part... - Oh come now, come now... Urban isn't the only one out there. You are the Watchmaker's daughter. You can have your pick. - I want no one else. - Oh please. How about the mayor's son, the youngest one... - What's his name? - don't know, and I don't care. And what about... The goldsmith? He's old, he must be at least 60. Old? At 60? That can make him interesting. And he owns a house on the square. Laura? - Laura... Well then no. Next time I won't ask you! Looks like that watchmaker Just wanted to get rid of you. Have you ever heard of such a watch? I have. I've even seen it. Move! I held it in these very hands. - It must have been a mess after being in your hands. -Shut it! - Did you really see it? - Yep. Quite a gadget. Just a little watch without hands on a necklace. - And do you know where it is? - Hey, do you have anything to drink? - A swill of beer or something. - Just water. Water? I think it's time you go. You weren't invited to this fire. Yeah. Look here, boys, you'd better watch out for me. - Yeah, sure, now go away. - Yeah, sure, now go away. Wait, why are you driving her off? Please, tell me where the watch is. You'd have to come with me. - I will go. - But you're going with us. To the Royal Capital. You can't trust her. Look at the state of her. Well, are you coming or not? - And why should I trust you? - Look at the state of us. I'm going with her right now. She'll lead me to the watch. - She said she saw it. - No! Hey, hang on! We also... ...saw the watch. Right. We didn't manage that very well. - You didn't manage it well. -Me? - I was baking an apple. - I was baking an apple, too. So, we've got baked apples. Urban! My prophecy will be the stronger... What? Nothing. I can't go on anymore. We have to take a rest. Do you want the watch or not? Move it, don't be lazy. There. THE CUCKOO INN That's a public house. The watch is in there? Good day to you. Good day. Good day. - Beer? Sure. Sir... have you heard of a strange watch that warns of death? No. We don't need that kind of nonsense here. Around here we say cuckoos warn of death. Count how many calls you hear from the forest, and that's how many years you have left. - And that's that. - But... - I heard you have the watch here. - What? Me? Yeah. That's rubbish. And I wouldn't hang around here too long if I were you. Why not? I'll have another. As you wish, I warned you. Warned me? About what? You'll soon see. As soon as the clock strikes 12... It goes haywire. The cuckoo pops out without a sound. And instead of going to one o'clock, it starts turning back to 11. And then it starts. First, the three drivers appear at that table. Publican! Beer! As soon as I bring the beer they start arguing. Basically... all the patrons will gradually come back in. Then they start fighting and smash the whole pub up on me. And I have to clean up all the mess again! And at noon the whole thing starts again. It's just... it does your head in. I'd like to see that clock. I'm a trained watchmaker. There's been lots of watchmakers. They're a dime a dozen. They watched all right, and that's it. And most of them ended up in here, because anyone who ends up here past the stroke of noon never gets out of the circle. - Liar! -Who are you calling a liar? - You're a liar! Stop throwing that beer, dammit! Who's supposed to clean it all up? I should have thrown you out the moment you came in. You seem like an alright guy, it's a shame. Do something! - What am I supposed to do? Look! What are you doing here? “Who's going to clean all this up? Me! You?! I want to see that! Come here! - Just you wait... I'll show you! I don't know how you can enjoy this. Yeah. And this isn't how it was supposed to be. If you hadn't told the Watchmaker he was going to die Urban and Laura would have been in their wedding bed long ago. - Yeah. - Yeah! And the Watchmaker on the funeral bier. You know just as well as I do. Why did you tell him, though? - Yeah! Anybody who gets dragged along by their nose is stupid. Dummies! And that's why my prophecy will always be the stronger. Yeah, sure, your prophecy will always be stronger than ours, blah... Yeah, right, sure, are you done now? And he's done for. I'm going to watch this every day. We'll see about that. What havoc! Again and again! I should really sell the place. So... Agreed. - Laura is so excited. - As am I, Watchmaker. Pity your daughter is not home, I wanted to see her, to kiss her hand. Yes, she's not. She had to go to her aunt's. To her aunt's, you see. You'll see her soon enough. Now that's a real groom. Not some Urban. Now I have nothing to fear. Laura! I don't know if you are doing the right thing. Are we so needy that Laura has to be sold off like this? As if you could understand! Laura! Laura. I'm ashamed of having to lie because of you. We'll soon be done with this resistance of yours. Darn it. My dear Laura... It looks like Urban really did run away. Otherwise he would have come back long ago. Publican! Beer! Service! I want beer! Beer? I'm not looking at your cards. You're the cheat here! - Now sit down! - Stop throwing that beer! Who's supposed to clean it up? I told you you wouldn't get out of here easily. Guys! Guys, I want to get down! Come on now. Who told you not to trust the old hag? Who told you not to go with her? And to come to the city with us? - Did. - did. I'd go anywhere for Laura. - The only place you're going now is... - Nowhere. Because this pub will not just let you go. - First, you have to break its spell. - But how? The curse will be broken when the cuckoo broods its eggs. But cuckoos never brood any eggs, particularly their own. The egg is hidden there, up in the clock. And the cuckoo that hatches from that egg has to call out at the stroke of midnight. If not, the pub will remain cursed forever and you will never get out. Publican! Beer! Beer? - Sir, I know how to stop this. - You don't say. There's a cuckoo egg hidden in the clock. We have to find it. Is this just another dumb idea? - A cuckoo egg. - I'll be darned, where'd that come from? All we need now is for the cuckoo to brood it. What kind of nonsense is that? A cuckoo never broods its eggs. And what if it did? How can you be enjoying this?! It's awful! It's ready. The sunlight allows the cuckoo to keep the egg at the right temperature so that it will hatch within a few hours. As long as it doesn't cloud over. The sun's almost gone, and no luck. That's incredible. Here you go, feed it. It eats. More... There. It's a miracle! A miracle. And it looked like such a dumb idea. It needs lots of food. A miracle. Now it just has to call out at the right moment. It flew off without a sound. It won't come back. It's not midnight yet. Oh Urban! I'm selling the place. It's back! It's cuckooing. It's cuckooing! It's cuckooing! It's cuckooing! It's cuckooing! It's cuckooing! It's cuckooing! Urban! You did it! If I were you, I'd forget about some silly watch. - I'd go home and never look back. - I know... but the Watchmaker won't give me Laura's hand without it. Well good luck, and take care. Thank you. And stop by for a beer sometime! Just you wait! Brothers, if I speak the languages of men and of angels, but have not love, then I will be nothing but a ringing gong or clanging cymbal. Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy, love does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices when people live in truth, It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things... Anselm. What are you doing here? - Anselm! “Love always perseveres. - Anselm! - Anselm! - You little devil. What's wrong, Anselm? Anselm, what's wrong? What are you doing? Did you come to save me? - Laura... - Laura... Laura. I love you, Laura. Wait for me. I will return. Urban. - Laura, what... - Laura... - What does this mean? - Laura... - Laura! - Laura! I'll take care of this. - Stay here. - Stay here. We're not going to fight in a church. Let go of me. I don't know... Shouldn't we go with him? Then we could have just brought the watch and left it under his nose. And he wouldn't even have to go anywhere. We could have! Why didn't we? No, we could not have. Urban has to get the watch himself, now that everything's all bungled up. She bungled it up. The old witch. That's just like her! Look out, here he comes. Let's go. ROYAL CAPITAL You're right. We should probably go with him. - That's what I said from the start. Well so did I, actually, kind of. Camels! Camel rides! I told you to watch him carefully. Come and see something here that you only hear of elsewhere! The passionate female giant, the two Eskimo cousins as cold as ice! The ugliest monster in the world! Is it a man, or some kind of troll? Does it live in a house or in a hole? Just one look at him and you will carry the sight to the grave! Come closer! Come closer! The lizard lady loves her baby however big a snake it may be! Come closer! Come closer! Ladies and gentlemen, for just some spare change see the strangest of the strange! Come closer! Come closer! Just look at you! Are you trying to be inconspicuous like that? Hey, mind your own business. You could use a disguise, too, you ragbag. Put this turtle shell on your head and go find some water. You can get a wash while you're at it. Good idea! I never thought of that. Maybe I could go for a splash. Good idea, boys! “Look where you sent her. - didn't send her! I meant it figuratively. We have to go after her. Well come on, darn it! - This way! -That way! No there! -This way is shorter! Wash my back, my dear sir. What? Wash my back. I can't reach it. - That's cold! - It's you! And so what? You sent me to that pub on purpose. Where's the watch that warns of death? If you really want the watch, then you have to go to the mountain where the sun never sets. The mountain where the sun never sets? Yep. I don't believe you. Well don't ask me then if you don't believe me. Stupid. Monsters... Move apart. What? What? Help me. Help me out of this cage. Me? Help me get out of this cage. Please. But how? They are always guarding you. Try something. I guess you have some loose change since you've been peeking for so long! Why is that man in a cage? You mean this monster? Because he always runs away! And meanwhile, he lacks for nothing. He's got food, no work to do, and yet he's always complaining. Where else can he go? All he'd get is a thrashing, everyone's afraid of him. He should be glad he has a cage to live in. So pay up. I don't have anything. Not even a penny. Well, well, well! Happy to look but not to pay, is it? There would be plenty like you. Get lost then! Ladies and gentlemen, come closer! Come closer! Here you will see something you can see nowhere else! Come closer! - You have to help him. - Tonight, no one will be guarding him. Oh, staring out the window for a change. I was worried I might find you staring at the table. All your sitting about and staring is ridiculous. "The poor, crazed girl." That's what they're calling you. Urban is lost to the world anyway. And don't think that running away from the altar means it's all over. There Is going to be a wedding, even if I have to keep you there in chains. Come on. I would rather die. Here. - Your boss sent you this. He'll be in the tavern a bit longer. Hang on now, what's all this? What's supposed to happen? A couple of eggs would be more exciting. Good evening. I'll pay. How much? Another two? There. See you. Oh hello there! I thought you'd never come back. It's a time lock. And what does that mean? That it's not so easy. We'll see. Maybe you could get together with the Eskimo girls. Yeah, sure. Boys, I've had enough. - Time to go home. No. Not yet. Hang on now. Wait a second. About those Eskimo girls... He's coming. You have to get out of here. I'll try one more thing. If he catches you he'll put you in a cage, too. Run. You have a magic touch, Urban. Now we're Siamese triplets. Oh yeah! Hey, boys... “Why won't you let me get in the middle? - don't know. - Go on then. - I am going, -it's you who's not going. One, two... Hey, wait, come here, come here. There. You see? An empty cage. Great. Careful it doesn't... How comfy! Which side of us will lie down? Locky locky. Nice and tighty. Help! A monster! Help! A monster! Here! Here! Faster! And don't come back! Hang on. Hopefully they won't find us here. It's not easy for you. They really are all afraid of you. I'll accompany you home so no one hurts you. No one has been so kind to me in a long time. This is for freeing me. It's a watch that can warn against death. - It's yours now. - What? So that's where the strange chiming was coming from. It can't be. - How did you get it? - Once, I served a rabbi. He didn't mind me being a monster because he was blind. He couldn't even see who was serving him. And that blind rabbi was almost 250 years old. And all thanks to this watch, which he had made himself. He took it everywhere he went. - Servant? - Yes? Close the window. There's a draft. - That would be the death of me. - He never took a step without the watch. And death could not touch him. And what happened then? Well, one day... was accompanying him on his regular stroll and the rabbi suddenly realised he had left the watch at home. The watch... Just a moment. Of course, I went for it straight away. And I ran as fast as I could. But when I got back with the watch, the rabbi was already lying there on the ground. Lifeless. “What did you do then? Nothing. Everyone started blaming me for the rabbi's death. "The monster did it." I ran away. What was I supposed to do, leave it there? Thank you. But I'll still see you home first, like I said. I have no home. - Then you can come to my home. No... I scare people, I would just complicate everything. I'll stay here. Here I won't bother anyone. Oh, my head hurts. Where are we? Where are we? Come on. We're locked in. Help! Hello? Help! Help! - Open up! -Help! - Open the door! Let us out of this cage, dammit! - Let us out right now! Hello? - Get up! - Open this cage! - Open up! - Do you hear? What are you two doing in here? How did you get in there? Where is my rarest specimen? - We are not an attraction! - We are not an attraction! No? And I thought you were! Bring my hairy monster back, and maybe... Maybe! I'll let you go. You definitely had a hand in his disappearance. What an idea. Siamese twins. The bad idea was the alcohol. Don't tell me we're going to end up stuck together forever -in this stupid cage. - We have to wait. We can't do anything until we get these evil spirits out. “What are you doing? Breathing makes it go faster. Breathe. Urban! My beloved Laura! Urban dearest! Time to wake up. You thief! Give it back! I told you once already: you're a fool! This does not look good. Has she eaten? No. She will not eat anything at all. We tried to get something into her by force, but no luck. Your daughter's condition is quite serious. We will have to bring her to hospital. To hospital? There goes even more money. Urban dear! My prophecy will be the stronger. My prophecy will be the stronger... Ladies and gentlemen, come closer! What you see here you will never see elsewhere. Our most exciting new specimen, scarier than a two-headed calf, two men half and half! The furious Siamese twins! - Disperse! Move it! Where are my twins? Surprised huh? Let us out of here right now or we'll call reinforcements. Move it, move it. Quick, quick, lock him up. And marry the Eskimos yourself. Help! What are you staring at? Unlock the door! Let me out! Help. Come on already. Well up you go, I guess, eh? Give me back that watch. - Here. I told you, if you want the watch, you have to climb the mountain where the sun never sets. Voila. But careful... No one has ever come back from that mountain. I'm not afraid. I'm going for the watch. Sure, of course... Anything for Laura, right? Careful! It's slippery! Up you go! Up you go! Oh, it's the deadbeat gentlemen, welcome. This is overdoing it a bit. And you're a bit too late. If Urban doesn't come back, then just you wait... Oh! Scary, scary! Of course he's not coming back. My prophecy will be the final word. There. She won't eat at all. She's had nothing to drink. You have to get at least a bit of soup into her, by force if necessary. Otherwise the only thing she will need is a priest. - You have to manage somehow. No... Nice work. But that watch is of no use to you now. You can't get back down. Who are you? I am Morana. I rule over death. This moth is for you. Let me go. I have to get back to Laura, I promised her. Oh? And why? Why should I do that? You don't know, do you? But I do. You're a watchmaker. So make me a timepiece. In return, I will give you your life back. And who are you? I am Vita. I rule over fertility and life. Look. This moth was yours when you were born. Fine then. Make a clock, since you're a clockmaker. But how? I have nothing here, there's only sand and rocks. If you can't do it, then you can't do it. In that case you will never leave this place. If there was at least some shade around here. Shadow. Sunlight. Excellent. Well, you certainly outwitted me. Bravo. You are free to go. But you're not going to have an easy time of It. This moth... is for Laura, the poor girl. She is dying. Dying of longing for you. If the moth gets to her before you do... Then she will die. lam sorry. I will get to Laura before your moth. I will not stop. I can do it. Urban? That will come in handy. Consider yourself lucky. - Yeah, now leave him alone. - Last warning. You haven't won yet. Laura! Laura! Urban! You're back! Tasty, is it? - What do you want from me now? Nothing, nothing. Just that Urban is on his way to the hospital to see Laura... What? He's come back? Yep, he sure has. And there's going to be a wedding. That will be fun. I hope you've picked out a coffin for yourself. Damn it. It's you or him now. Here. That might come in handy. Look out. OK, come on. Urban! Come here. Laura! Laura, get up. Window. Laura... Wake up. Laura... No. Laura... When the moon comes out in the sky And moves the bright of day aside I start to worry about you in the darkness. I hide my dreams behind closed eyes Again and again I softly sigh The name that gives me no rest. Without you my heart is tom apart My heart is but a part... Laura. Lie, lie. I'm terribly thirsty. Come, come, come. What's that chiming sound? Father! I had a dream you were being attacked by some monster. So came right away to save you and what do I see? It's our Urban. Our boy. I completed the task. The watch that warns of death. Oh... Good grief... Cheers. Cheers, father. Take it easy, take it easy. As long as I have the watch, nothing can happen to me. But what if I lose it? Or it gets stolen by someone? - What are you doing in here? Nothing. - Come be with the others. - I can't right now. Your only daughter is getting married and you're in here playing with that nonsense. Nonsense? Oh please... Nonsense! Go! I'll come. Nonsense... I have to find out how it works. If lost it, I'd be done for. I could make a spare. One, or maybe even two. Then I could even sell them. Under my own name. Why not? Darn it. Looks like that wasn't much help... What the... Who could be bothering us at this hour? And the dog doesn't even bark. Layabout. By consequence of what Is written here, and according to local law and custom, the Watchmaker's house and garden will be left to his wife and his daughter, Laura. And the son-in-law, Urban, will receive the Watchmaker's workshop and equipment. And then there is the fortune of 100,000 gold coins. In gold. What fortune? The Watchmaker had some money, but where would he have got so much gold? I suppose he had it hidden under his mattress. I'm only reading what is written here, it's all by the law. So he had that much money stashed away and I had to save all this time? Madame? - Thank you. So... we can go ahead and sign. There. Here you are. Down here. Right there. Your signature. Is something wrong? No, I just have the feeling I know you. That's impossible. That's possible. I said it was impossible. So, your signature, please. Sometimes people meet and don't even know it, right? Oh, what's this? That's a watch that used to warn of death. Laura's spitting image. - Urban's spitting image. I'll show you a spitting image. Just wait for next time... We'll see whose prophecy will be the stronger. THE END
