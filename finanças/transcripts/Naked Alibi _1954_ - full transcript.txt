No. - How much longer will have to sit here? - That depends. I told you I didn't do anything. You were drunk and disorderly. - So I had a few. - No identification. You say your name is Al Willis, we don't know. Must've left my wallet in the bar, that's no crime. If you are who you say you are, there's no need to worry. - A man is checking on you now. - Cops? You guys give me the pain, think got a license to shove people around? I'm a respectable citizen, I never had any cop trouble before. Then you won't have any now, so take it easy. I'm getting out of here. Take your grubby hands off me. Stinking cops. Nobody socks me around like that, nobody. I get even, I always do. What happened? Brought him in on a drunk charge, questioning about those east side robberies. He got wild and I got careless. - You better have that taken care of. - Yeah. Excuse me chief. Fred, Albert Wilson is his name all right. Runs that bakery like he said, good reputation. As far as I can tell he's never even been arrested. Alright, tell him he can go. Ed, I want to talk to you in the morning about the Foley Jewel theft. - You haven't been making too much progress. - Well, you know what we had to go on. I'd like those robbery reports on my desk first thing in the morning Fred. Alright. - Working kind of late again. - Yeah. Yeah, lots to do, you've seen this? - What's that Goodwin want anyway? - New chief of detectives. I'll hear about in the morning, I got an appointment with the commissioner. I, I'm sorry lieutenant, I want to apologize for what I said and did. Joanie had a bad dream, she's all right now. - You have a good time? - Sure. - Sorry I'm late dear. - Al... Oh, it's nothing, I had a little trouble, that's all. - What happened? - The police. They thought I was someone else, it was a mistake. - But they hurt you. - No, it's all over, forget it. Now go to bed, eh? I'll run down the shop see if everything is all right. I see you in a little while. She hit me on the head with a plate. You can't see the scar because some hair is grown over it. Well, good night Max. - Good night lieutenant, see you tomorrow. - You bet. Hello? Hello? Attention all units. Attention all units. Hold anyone in possession of firearms... for investigation of the murder of a police lieutenant. Refer any information to Homicide Detail, Central Headquarters. No description of suspect. Here they are. - 32s, eh? - Not quite, fraction smaller. 7.63s. Probably fired from a German Mauser. That's something, special gun might not be so hard to find. Well, that eliminates most of the fish we hauled in last night. Lots of colts and a few lugers. - No Mauser. - Want some coffee Stu? No thanks. - Thanks Stu. - Alright. Oh and check out Fred's active sheet. He might've been closing in on someone and give his files a going over. - Somebody could've been holding a grudge. - Be right on it. Now, wait a minute. Come on. Later. Al Willis, bring him in. - Happy honeymoon. - Bye, bye. Albert Willis? - We'd like you to come with us. - What for? We want to talk to you about the killing of lieutenant Parks. I don't know anything about it, just what I read in the papers. - I don't know anything. - We'll talk about it downtown. I don't want to go downtown, they'll beat me. - Mr. Willis, you... - I won't go. I didn't do it, I don't know anything about it. I didn't kill him. - Get me a doctor, will you? - You'll live. At least let me get it bandaged. You'll get it fixed just fine, as soon as you admit you killed Lieutenant Parks. - I didn't do it, I told you. - You ran. - I was scared. - Yeah. Yeah, sure you were, because you killed him. No, I kept thinking how they beat me up the last time. And who started that? Alright, I was drunk, sore. I admitted I was wrong, what more do you want? You also swore you'd get even and now you have. No. I know things are pretty bad for me now, starting that fight and all that. But shooting off at the mouth is one thing and killing a guy is something else. Not always. Why you so anxious to pin this thing on me anyway? Why? Because you killed him, that's why. Because you shot him in the back with a German Mauser. - A what? - Now, where did you hide the gun? I've never even seen a German Mauser. - Why don't you leave me alone? - I will. Just as soon as you tell me the truth. Now let's start all over again, where were you last night? I told you, I told you. I was at my shop working, baking. All night? From 11 o'clock on, ask my help, ask any of them. Lt. Parks was killed within two blocks of your place. I don't suppose you could've slipped out... killed him and ducked back without being missed, could you? Not much. Willis' attorney and wife are out there. My name is Frazier, I'm Mr. Willis' attorney. - I don't believe you've met Mrs. Willis. - How are you? The officers didn't have to hit him like that. They did hit him. They were justified Mrs. Willis, your husband was resisting arrest. May I see him? Please? Alright. Chief, I think you should know that I have three of Willis' employees... ready to testify that he was in the shop all night long. You didn't waste any time, did you? And I can produce a dozen character witnesses. - You got the wrong man chief. - I don't think so. Mrs. Willis already phoned her councilman Edgar Goodwin. And told him what's been happening to her husband... naturally the councilman is interested. Naturally. Why, don't you think the wise thing to do would be to let him go? No, I don't, he's a killer. Wilma? Mr. Frazier. May I speak to him please? Frank, chief Conway would like to speak to you. - Hello. - Joe, what's with this Willis thing? Goodwin is got to you already, I see. Now don't sour up Joe, he's just doing his duty, trying to protect his constituency. Yeah? Now, you keep forgetting... any public department is answerable to a lot of people, that's the way things work. - Now, what about Willis? - I'm going to hold him. Well, if you've got anything on him... I mean, anything tangible in the way of evidence? - No. - Then I don't see how you can... He did it. I saw his face when he made that vow. Proof Joe, what proof have you? Just give me a little time with him and I'll have all the proof I need. Look Joe, I like you but I don't know what's got into you lately. Maybe you're working too hard or something... but you're getting yourself a rough reputation. Now, take a tip. Change your tactics or you're liable to find yourself without a job. Now, you better turn Willis loose. Alright. Alright, you can go. I don't know what you trying to do, but I don't want to be a fall guy for anyone. I'm innocent, honest. Put a tail on him. - Sgt. Brawley. - Vic, I want a tracer out on Al Willis. Yes sir, alright. - Good morning George. - Good morning Jane. George. - Lawn sure looks a lot better. - I'm telling you Henry is got a green thumb. Bye dear. - I guess I should've been a gardener. - Yeah. No kidding, I really got the touch. Well, maybe someday I'll get myself a little nursery and I'll get every... About a quarter to 12 last night, Willis came out of the shop... and went directly to the community church. I waited across the street so I could watch the front and side door. Twenty minutes later, I began to wonder. Walked over, looked inside, no Willis. Figured he ran out the back door so I scoured the neighborhood. Nothing. Twenty after two, I spotted him back in the shop again, mixing dough. That's about it Chief. - Yeah. - Go along home, eh? Nice. - How about another flower over here? - No, I don't think so. Joanie is going to like it. - Hey, what is this? - Search warrant Mr. Willis. What do you expect to find? Oh, we're not particular, as long as it's a German Mauser or explosives. Explosives? I don't know what you're talking about. You know, quarter of 12 at night is a strange time for a man to go to church. I go to church whenever I want to. There's no rule says when a man is supposed to pray. You didn't go there to pray. You went in there to ditch your shadow, slipped out the back way... - wired Sergeant Jenkin's car with a bomb. - Bomb? I still don't know what you're talking about. Alright, where were you this morning between midnight and 2:20? Well, I was, I was at the... At the Merchants' club. That's right, I was at the Merchants' club. We had a big party, a celebration. Why you leave the church by the back door? Well, the club is on 4th street and it's, it's closer that way. - Lots of people at the party? - Yeah and they saw me. - Liquor? - Well... So you went in, spread yourself around to establish an alibi and left. Alibi? What do I need an alibi for? I haven't done anything. Why don't you leave me alone? I'm trying to live a simple, decent life. So were those three dead officers. Now I want to hear all about it, everything. I want a full confession. I hear Andy Babcock is being up to chief. Well, I guess he can use these alright. The department is been called off Willis, you know. Commissioner is got an idea the killer is one of the Scanella crowd. Well, it's not your problem anymore, you can get yourself a nice rest. Thanks Owen, excuse me, I got a call to make. Ok Joe. - Matthews detective agency. - Hello Matt, Joe Conroy, you got some time? - Sure. - Meet me at the square, West Side. - Twenty minutes. - I'll be there. Alright. - Hi Joe. - Matt. Willis did it Matt, I don't care what anyone says, I've seen these guys before. - He's a cop killer. - What about the tracer Joe? - You had one on him. - Nothing came back. Then I don't get it, guy is got nothing on him. Wife, kid, religious and all that. - Rubs three cops? Doesn't make sense. - Does it have to? You remember that Dechellis case? School teacher shoots an officer because he gave him a traffic ticket. - Does that make sense? - No. Alright, who knows what goes on in people's minds? I don't, but I do know about Willis. - He's psycho. - Some people are saying that about you Joe. I said some people, what you want with me? I want a tail on Willis, every minute, day and night and I want him to know it. You put in with me and we'll split the watch. I don't care how miserable we've to make his life. I want to goad him into blowing his cork, into making a mistake. Maybe even into going for the murder gun. If what you say he is Joe... - he'll come gunning for you. - That's my worry. How about it? - Ok, your show. - Thanks, Just don't forget one thing, he's a killer. Cigarette? What's the matter Al? Nothing dear, nothing. - All loaded Mr. Willis. - Thank you Jeff. - Good night Al, see you next week. - Good. Hey... Where are you? I know you're here, come on out. Who are you? Why are you following me around all the time? - Hello? - Hello Mr. Frazier, Al Willis. What's the matter Al? Someone is following me around, has been for days, everyplace I go. What is this? I thought you said the department is been called off. - It has Al. - Then who could've... Conroy. Who else? - He's crazy. - No. What am I supposed to do? Live the rest of my life with him on my tail? - Because he's got this screwy idea that... - Al, take it easy. I'll phone chief Babcock in the morning. He'll bring Conroy in and talk to him, now go to bed. Alright. Yes, he's here. Alright, I'll tell him. That was Mr. Frazier Al. He said chief Babcock will keep Conroy there another 20 minutes. - Good, that'll give me enough time. - Al? - Yeah? - Maybe you don't have to go now. Maybe chief Babcock will get Conroy to stop bothering you. I got to go Helen, I got to find me a nice quiet place to rest. Get my nerves back into shape. - I hate to leave you Helen, you know that. - It's all right Al. - If you think it's best. - Look... let's make believe it's just another business trip. I'll be back in a little while and the whole mess will be forgotten. - Where you go Al? - I don't know yet. I'm not sure but I'll write. I know on those other business trips I never got around to writing. But I will this time, you'll see. - The taxi is waiting Al. - Take good care of everything Otto. Yeah, I will. Goodbye dear. Goodbye Al. Your message service called. They want you to call this number right away. Thanks. - Hello? - Hello Matt, that you? Joe, I'm glad I got to you, I'm at the bus terminal. Willis just bought a ticket for Border city. Border city? - He could cross into Mexico. - Could be. Bus leaves in a few minutes, I thought maybe you'd like to have me follow him down. - No, no. I'll do it. - Watch yourself Joe. If he spots you down there, he can rub you and make it look real good. Yeah, I'll be in touch, eh?

Howdy. Say, can you tell me if this man is crossed the border? Would've been within the last half an hour or so. - No señor, not tonight. - You sure? Have you seen him? Did he come through here?

That's 3 dollars a night in advance. - You can sign in later. - Thank you. - Shine mister? - No thanks. It's a dime well spent, saves the leather in the long run. How about some postcards then? See the beauty of our Mexican neighbors. Beautiful señoritas and the gay caballeros. Look, you take this and run along home to bed, eh? Ok, thanks mister. - Howdy. - Hi.

Well... - Ok? - Come on. The dough gets split three ways, but the gun is mine, I saw it first. They won't fit you, come on. Uncle Charlie, uncle Charlie. There's a man out here, he's dead. Uncle Charlie, uncle Charlie, uncle Charlie. - Is he really dead? - No but he's hurt bad. Better get him inside. What is it? Found him in the alley, just saw him last night. - Gave me four bits. - Petey, run for the doctor. Ok. Get some hot water. - I better get the police. - No, don't. - Oh, I don't want any trouble Marianna. - There won't be any trouble. Please Charlie, for me. And do me a favor, will you? Don't tell anyone he's here. - You feeling better? - Who are you? My name is Marianna, I live upstairs. Petey found you in the back. - That answer all your questions? - No. Don't be too inquisitive, doctor said no exertion. - Who's Petey? - You'll see. He went to get your prescription filled. Thanks. I used to bite them, now I'm letting them grow. It's worse, I think. You in the habit of hauling in cut-up strangers? Yeah, it's a hobby with me. What's your name? - Carlton, Joe Carlton. - You're new in Border City. You better keep out of alleys unless you don't want to grow old. - Where you from? - Up north. - Los Angeles or Phoenix, I bet. - No. Well, do I keep on guessing or you got secrets? - Hi. - Petey, Mr. Carlton. - Yeah, we met last night. - Feeling better, eh? Man, were you bloody. Well, thanks for dragging me in. - What's that? - Sleeping powder. The doctor wants you to get some sleep. Go ahead and take it. Marianna and me, we're going to fix you up just fine. Strong stuff, so don't smoke and don't get out of bed. Go on, drink it. We'll see you later. Good to see you back in town Al. I'll tell the boys about the party. Close it, would you Felix? What's this about a party? I'm taking the place over after closing, going to throw a big one. Where you've been all day? I've been looking for you. - Getting some dresses fitted. - I'll buy you a pretty hat to go with them. - Al... - Yeah? Al, when are we going to get married? - What's the rush? - No rush. - We've known each other a long time. - Sure. - When? - When I say when, that's when. How about this weekend? Irish will give me a few days off. What's got you on this marriage kick all of a sudden? The way you come and go Al. I wait around for you, I never know if you'd be back or not. I always come back, I always will. I know, but I worry. Last time you were gone so long, I... I thought maybe you got into trouble or something. Trouble? Me? No, no. No. Where do you go when you leave me Al? What do you do? What is it matter? I worry about you, that's what, I worry about you. You know all about me you need to. - Where you going? - To change my dress for the party. I'll walk you. - You don't have to. - It's all right. Come on baby, let's dance it up, eh? - Hey, you bet, I'm with you. - What? Nobody touches her, you understand? He was drunk, you know I can handle those guys, I do it all the time. Alright, alright, I'm sorry. I'm crazy about you, I can't stand anybody touching you, that's all. - Ok, let's drop it. - Are you sore? No, I'm not sore, you go back and get the party started. It can wait. - What's the matter? - Nothing. I'm just going to go upstairs and change my dress for the party. Well, let's go. - You are sore. - No, I told you I'm not. - Come on. - Al, later on. Ok baby. But don't be too long, I might have to come back for you. You wouldn't like that, would you? Come in. - Oh, guess I didn't wake you. - No. I just wanted to see how you were. Oh, I'm all right, I'm a little sore but I'll be Ok. Feel like talking? We haven't had much chance. - Yeah, sure. - I'll warm up the coffee. - Guess you be leaving soon. - It's right. You have to go? - Will you be back? - I don't know. You come, you go. I don't know anything about you. Does it matter? Why? Still puzzled? - Who are you really Joe? Where you from? - I told you. Up north, that's all you said. You really didn't tell me anything. - You didn't tell me anything. - Ask, whatever you want to know. - Where you from? - Here. - No, no. Before here. - Oh, I moved around a bit. Atlantic City, that's where I was born. Baltimore, Nashville, New Orleans. See, I tell you everything. Why you come to Border City? - Who you tell I was here? - Nobody. Honest, Charlie, petey, and me, We're the only ones who know, why? Oh, I just want to find out if you're a blabbermouth. I can keep a secret. Don't you have a boyfriend? He won't like this. You're hiding from someone, is that it Joe? - No. - Who is he? - What will he do if he finds you? - I said no. Tell me about him. - Cream and sugar? - Black. Well, bombs away. It's funny, I don't understand you and you don't understand me. You know, we got a lot in common. See you in the morning. Hello, operator? I want to make a collect call to Matt Matthews, Montgomery 7... - Hello. - Hello Matt, this is Joe. - Go ahead Joe, I'm listening. - I saw Willis, he's in town alright. I don't know where he's staying just yet but he's got himself a girl. - That makes it nice. - Yeah, now listen... I want you to wire a photo or picture of Willis... to Baltimore, Nashville and New Orleans. See if any of them got a warrant on him. His girl is done quite a bit of moving around and I have a hunch... maybe they were together in some of those cities anyway, it's worth checking out. - I'll send the photos right off. - Right. Now, wire any info you get to Joe Carlton, Border City Motel, tomorrow. I'll be waiting. Got it. Right, I don't think his girl knows as much about him as she'd like but... she'll break this case. Hold it, hold it, hold it now. I got to go Matt, I think she's on her way to him now. See you later, eh? You took your time getting here. Why don't you watch where you're going? I'm sorry Mr. Willis, I was just walking... Go on play, what am I paying you for? - Let me go. - What's the matter with you? - It wasn't his fault, you bumped into him. - So I bumped into him. Have a little fight at my own party, what's wrong with that? Or don't you remember what it's like to have fun anymore? Something wrong? Listen, sit and now let's talk. I know that you got something in your mind you're not talking about. - Another guy? - There's no other guy. It better not be, I find you two timing me, I'm going to make you feel real sorry. Where you going? Oh no baby, we got a date. Just a drunk. Anna. Why do you have to go? Stick around a little while. I can't do it Petey. Thank your uncle for me and tell him I'll pay him for the room as soon as I can. But where you going? Leaving town? Going back home? - You ask too many questions. - Pays know what's going on. - Marianna, you up? Mr. Carlton is leaving. - Just a minute. I just want to say goodbye Marianna, I got to go. - Have some coffee with me. - No thanks. - Keeps me asleep. - This time you can watch. Alright. Ok, so I'm too young for coffee. I'm sorry you going. Things don't always work out the way you think they will, do they? - I mean, the way you hoped. - No, they don't. - You make mistakes. - We all do. Nothing like the ones I made I bet, nothing like that. - Maybe we better forget about the coffee. - What's the matter? I guess you better go now Joe, I just keep rattling on. So many things keep coming to my mind. My mother would be 60 this month. How good the ocean smells in Atlantic city. Screwy things to think about now. I don't know what's the matter with me today, I feel like a chatterbox. - I don't mind. - It's nice. Goodbye Joe. Goodbye. Petey, might be nice to know where he's going. Well, I'll be in my room the rest of the day, I'm expecting an important wire. If it should come in, why, send it right over, will you? - Sure will. - Thanks. - All we did was squabble. - I don't remember anything. She loaded me up with so much Tequila I passed out. - Oh, my head. - Fix you up in no time. Something is wrong with that dame, that's all. - It's another guy, I bet. - Sure. Well, it's got to be, what else? Well, I'm going to find out, I can tell you that. Here Al. Just came in Al, in the dressing room. - Dressing? - I have a number to do. Don't let me stop you. There, nobody will come barging in now. Go ahead. Go ahead. Getting bashful all of a sudden? You? That's a laugh. What's the matter with you Al? You act so... So what? Go on, say it. - So rough? - Yeah. You want to trade me for somebody new, eh? - Somebody nice and tender. - I don't know what's the matter with you. - Your new boyfriend, that's what. - I haven't got a new boyfriend. Don't lie to me, I know a cheat when I see one, I know when I'm being two timed. Two-timed? Who are you to talk about two timing when you got a wife? Who told you that? How do you know? How? Nobody knows about me down here, nobody. How do you know? How? Conroy, sure. That cop is still on my trail. That's it, isn't it? - I don't know a Conroy. - Don't lie to me. - I'm telling you Al, I don't know. - Don't lie to me, don't lie. - No Al, I don't know. - Bitch. No, I'm telling you Al. I had no idea Al. That's how I knew, I only guessed it Al. Honest, I only guessed it. Alright, I got a wife and a kid. But it's all over now, I'm getting a divorce. You and me, we going to get married. I'm sorry I lost my head honey. Why don't you go home and get yourself fixed up. I'll tell Irish you can't make the next show. - Who is it? - Marianna, open the door. - How you know where I was? - Petey knew, I told him to fallow you. Don't. Al Willis knows you're in town Joe. I knew you were looking for him all along. I saw the newspaper photo in your pocket. I tried to get information out of you, you know how. I just had to know more about him, now I know a lot. I know that you're a cop and your name is Conroy. The important thing is that Al suspects you're in town someplace. He'll start looking for you. Why you telling me? I want you to get out of town before he finds you, he'll kill you. I'll help you get out of town. No. No, I've been led through these streets before, I ended up with a knife in me. - Ok, do it your way. I told you. - Mariana... - Al? - Who else? - Why? - I wouldn't tell him where you were. Don't ask me why I wouldn't tell him, I wouldn't know. I'm sorry, where you see him last? - At the El Perico. - He follow you here? No. I was careful. - Joe, why won't you get out of here? - I'll tell you why. Al Willis killed three detectives, I was their chief. I got fired because I insisted he was the killer and I couldn't prove it. I'm not leaving here until I can. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. What you going to do? I'll turn this over to the police here. They'll pick him up on the old charge. I'll fill them in on the rest of the story and... and maybe we'll squeeze a confession out of Mr. Willis. I see. Well, I still don't see anything but maybe you better run along home, eh? - Just in case. - Alright Joe. - I'll see you Joe. - Yeah. - No gun Al. - Fine. Relax Conroy, this is a friendly party. Yeah, like the one you threw for Lieutenant Parks. - You're a stubborn man. - You're right. And you're so wrong, you've been at this for weeks. By now, even you ought to be convinced that I'm clean. - Sure. - The truth, eh? What do you say? I'm not sore. Willing to forget all about it. All you got to do is call it off. Look, to show you I got no hard feelings I... I'll buy you dinner at El Perico tonight. How about it? - Might not be a bad idea. - Come on. - Joe? - Al wants to see you. - Later. - Now. Come in Marianna, sit down. We've been waiting for you. Oh, don't worry, there won't be any trouble. Conroy and I just talked the whole thing out. Sort of buried the hatchet, didn't we? Sort of. Sit down. - No, thank you. - Just the way you like it baby, rare.. I'm not hungry. Too bad, how about a little of this? What's the matter baby? You're not drinking. I don't feel much like it. But we've got a happy little party going here, come on, join in. I'm sorry Al. Just don't sit there and look at him, put your arms around him. Kiss him. Oh, don't let me stop you. Go on, kiss him. I want to see how you do it. - She doesn't want to kiss me. - Sure she does. Bashful maybe because I'm here... but you shouldn't let that bother you, we're all friends now. The three of us. Go on, kiss him. Make love to him like you've been doing all along. I want to see if it's the same way you've been making love to me. - Al, I haven't. - Go on, kiss him, I say. Make love to him again, easy copper. I'm sorry Joe I, sorry I blew my top. I guess I'm a little jealous, eh? Maybe I'll get over it, eh? Hey Tony, what do you say we leave these two little lovebirds alone, eh? Finish up Joe. If there's anything else you want, just order up, it's on me, like I said. I want you to have a real good meal. - Boys all set? - Yeah. - Don't let them out the booth. - Yeah. - Al? - Yeah? I want my share now, ahead of time. Half now. Half later. - He's crazy Joe. - He sure is. What gets me is a guy like that going to church all the time. - He doesn't go to church. - He doesn't? He sure made a big thing back home about being religious. I don't know. We searched high and low for that murder gun. Nobody ever thought of searching the church. - They're Felix's friends. - Yeah, yeah. They start a fight and somebody gets it in the back, by accident. I got to call the police, they'll wreck my place. Keep an eye on me, I don't want any trouble, I'm not leaving the bar. - I'm not in the fight at all. - Sure, sure. I'll do it this way copper. The other was better but this will do just fine. Get into his arms baby. Die like lovers hugging each other. Where they go? I don't know, outside maybe they couldn't have gone far. Come on, let's look around. Get my car, eh? It's in the motel, a blue and silver two door Mercury. I'll meet you at the other end of the alley. Alright. Hey mister, looking for Mr. Willis and another guy? - Yeah, where they go? - It'll cost. Oh, come on, come on. They went around that way. Alright, let's go. - Thanks Petey. - My pleasure. Get in there. Can you use this? - That's Willis, let's get my car. - Wait. - We'll let the police catch him. - What? Al didn't do anything, Conroy beat him up in a cafe brawl. Shoved him into a car at gunpoint and took off. That's kidnapping, let's go talk to the cops. Wanted for kidnapping, Joseph Conroy. Male, Caucasian, about 36. Six feet four, 210 pounds, light hair, brown eyes. The victim is Albert Willis. Male, Caucasian, about 31. Six feet, 175 pounds. Blue and silver Mercury two door sedan, 1953. California license 1X78033. Believed traveling north on state highway 6. Conroy is armed. Attention all units. The search for kidnapper Joseph Conroy continues unabated... as federal, state, county and municipal law enforcement agencies unite... in one of the most unusual manhunts in the history of the state, where ironically... the object of the hunt it a ex-chief of detectives, a former man-hunter himself. They'll get you copper. One of those trigger happy bulls you used to boss around is going to blow your head off. Joe... - You better tend to business, eh? - Why don't you take him to the cops? Yeah, I would if I was sure the gun was in the church. But if it isn't, I'll never get my story to stick. They'll hang that kidnap charge on me. - I'm a psycho cop, that's what they think. - But showing them the telegram? There's nothing in there that proves he killed three officers, the gun is it. This figures to be in the church, and I think I got a way to turn it up. Out. Start walking. Get in. - Where do you think you're taking me? - Church on the square. You going to dig up that German Mauser for me. Yeah, don't laugh, I might just have a way of getting it out of you. - I can take anything you can give. - We'll see about that. Even if there is a gun, that doesn't mean it's mine. Don't go building a dream around that. It'll be traced back to you a dozen different ways. Yeah. - What's up Mac? - I'll take a look inside. Oh, for crying out loud, I got to get this load in. Ah, nothing but trouble... I'm 2 hours late getting started, the fuel pump goes sour and now this. - Hurry up, will you Mac? - Ok. - Hey, what is this? - Keep your mouth shut. Help her down. You, inside. And count a slow 100 before you start hollering, eh? Joe... It's all right, I want him to go. He's going to the church and dig up the gun but I'm going to get there first. Now listen, there's a hotel right up the street. You check in and stay there until you hear from me. - Ok Joe but be careful. - Yeah. Church on the square and roll it. Alright Conroy, let's go. Alright, now wait a minute boys, listen. Al Willis is on his way right now to get the gun that killed Lieutenant Parks. - All we got to do is get there first. - We'll talk about it downtown. - If we don't get going we'll be too late. - Sorry, we got orders to bring you in. Alright, let me talk to chief Babcock on the radio, eh? Take me to Church on the square quick. Where is he? Where's Conroy? You followed me here, both of you. Where is he? Where is he? Why you come in here alone? What kind of deal is this? Get in. Give me that gun. Shoot, you lousy cops. Shoot. Get away from there. Get an ambulance. Cops. Joe... I thought I, I could find out what he was going to do with the gun. - Just be quiet. - I should've met you sooner Joe, long ago. - It could've been so different. - I know. Who knows, you might even have fallen for me. Joe... I'm sorry about everything Joe.
