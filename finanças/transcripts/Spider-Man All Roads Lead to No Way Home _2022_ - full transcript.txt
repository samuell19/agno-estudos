- You must be Peter. - Yeah. - Hi. How you doing? - Dad, this is Peter. You know who I am... Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. I didn't believe it at first. When they called initially, I was like, "Finally." The nerd in me, the fanboy in me, on so many levels, said yes. To be here today with you two, it's, like, mind-blowing. - Peter. - Yeah? Oh, sorry, did you mean... I don't remember where the idea started, but just talking through it, it was like, "That would be crazy. That's impossible. How do we do it?" All right, let's get to work! This character moves me in a way that very few things do. To see this come together was really moving to me. Wow. This is going to be deeply special for people, and for me, as a fan, and I just feel incredibly grateful. It's like nearly 20 years worth of cinema coming together for one film. To now sit back and watch that is really amazing. Hello. Am I becoming an elder statesman? Maybe I am. It warranted the biggest solo superhero movie that's ever been made. It's a continuum of Spider-Man. All of these movies are now part of the same thing. - You're getting on my nerves. - I have a knack for that. Knock it off, man! No! It's so layered. It's so nostalgic and opens up the multiverse and allows for us to have... I didn't catch it. It's worthy of Spider-Man. I want Spider-Man! It was nice to be able to have everything coalesce into, at its essence, this simple story of Spider-Man. Whoo-hoo! What up, web slingers? This is my good friend Martin Starr. This is my good buddy J.B. Smoove. You want the first shift or the second? I could take either. Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien. We welcome you to All Roads Lead to No Way Home, a look back at 20 years of the Spider-Man movies. Whoo! - Nice knowing you, Spider-Man. - Wait, excuse me? The entire world's about to forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Introduced by the great Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in the pages of Amazing Fantasy, number 15, way back in 1962, Spider-Man wowed comic book readers at the time and never looked back. Whoo! Spawning everything from cartoons to Underoos... I had a pair of Underoos... To eight films and counting. Here we go. What just happened? It all began with the original Tobey Maguire trilogy from the early 2000s, which set a new standard for how superhero movies should operate. Those early Tobey Maguire-Sam Raimi Spidey films were very influential on me as a filmmaker. Sam understood these movies in a way that is very profound. It's like a character study within this superhero film. Go get 'em, tiger. And then came the Andrew Garfield Amazing Spider-Man reboot, blending slick visual style with more immersive action while bringing some all-time great Spider-Man bad guys to the big screen for the first time. An amazing sequel would follow, and then something incredible happened. I gotta go, I gotta go! Spider-Man joined the highly successful Marvel Cinematic Universe. Hey, everyone. To direct their new film, series producers turned to director Jon Watts, whose series really gets back to the character's high school roots, injecting his stories with youth, humor and massive MCU-sized action. It's great to just go back, figuring out any other things that we could connect, 'cause I just want it to be a complete world, so that in the end, it does feel like one story. I just love Spider-Man, and I want to do it justice. Now, Watts definitely has the Midas touch. Action! Including having the foresight to cast two incredibly talented supporting actors who elevate everything they touch. Zendaya and Jacob. That must be who you're talking about. Whoa, hey, look. I appreciate you, bro. I'm talking about us, Martin. They're great. What? You and me! - Oh, yeah, right. - I mean, we're pretty great. That is false. What'd I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes? Mr. Harrington and Mr. Dell do a lot of the heavy lifting in the recent films. Mr. Dell and I have it under control! Oh, no, no! Don't drag me into this, Roger! I'm doing my best, Julius! But this isn't just about us. This is about getting the folks at home up to speed on the Spider-Man movie history. Whoa. You are absolutely right. Thank you. Because a hero's work is never done! That sounds familiar. I believe there's a hero in all of us. Gives us strength. Even though sometimes we have to give up the thing we want the most. You have a gift. You have power. Are you going to step up or not? I don't know if that's me. I'm not Iron Man. - I made a choice. - It's my gift. This is my path. This is my chance to prove myself. - Who am I? - Peter. - Peter! - Hello, Peter. I'm just Peter Parker. Spidey's suits change, and evil villains come and go, but there's always been one constant anchoring all the Spider-Man films, -and that's the one and only Peter Parker. - Heard of him. People think Spider-Man is a man, that he's this grown superhero, but he's really not. He's a kid with everyday kid problems. What's up, guys? Peter Parker is such an international character because I believe that there is a Peter Parker in all of us. They love me. Peter Parker brings something to everybody, doesn't he? Yes! I think the essence of Peter Parker is gonna be constant, no matter how the character is played. That fundamental idea that, "With great power comes great responsibility," and Peter's trying to use it do the right thing. I am the most famous person in the entire world. And I'm still broke. Back in 2002, Tobey Maguire became the first actor to bring Peter Parker to life on the big screen. I just was looking at this character, and Sam's vision and then how I read the script and what I wanted to do with him, and then sometimes I'd put on tights and get on wires and stuff. Audiences were immediately drawn to his likable, off-kilter delivery... Okay. And transformed physique. It is a bit like jumping out of a plane and figuring out how the chute works on your way down. Whoo-hoo! It's about finding the soul of the character in a performer, and that's what Sam did with Tobey, and that's what we've strived to do on all of our MCU films since. And Tobey really showcased that. He was embracing the core of what the character was from the comics. I forgive you. Five years later, the baton was passed to British actor Andrew Garfield, who played Peter Parker in two Amazing Spider-Man films. A self-professed Spider-fan, Garfield landed his dream gig. I had to fight a lizard today, but it was not an ordinary lizard. Did you know he even did yoga and pilates to gain flexibility when striking those famous Spidey poses? - Oh, yeah. - The one where he puts his legs like this? Or when he jumps from a building and lands like this? Don't pop your hip out. We got a lot more to do here. Well, I need to be all limbered up to properly introduce the third and current incarnation of Peter Parker. - My man... - Tom Holland! An accomplished British actor as well as an experienced dancer capable of doing many of his own stunts. That was better. Tom has taken the role of Peter/Spidey and run with it, redefining the character for a whole new generation of fans. What makes Tom so good and genuine is that he performs Spider-Man with his whole body. Yeah, man. And under my expert mentorship and tutelage, Tom gives you the total package... Charisma, humor, relatability, vulnerability, those signature sophomoric quips. I'm starting to think you're not the Avengers. That's so good! When they put all three of us on camera for the first time in our suits, we all just burst out laughing. Just kind of spontaneously, all looking at each other like, "This is so weird, but I love it." It was like me and Tobey arrived, and all of their arms were just kind of open. So we were just, like, enfolded into the nucleus with them. It's like Spider-Man heaven. I felt really connected and really appreciated. There was a sense of coming back to something, and working with Andrew and Tom was really dear to me. The interaction and the respect between Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland is really something. I think I can... To see them in their suits and to laugh and joke and swap stories about their experiences and my experiences, that has been the highlight of my Spider-Man career, getting to share it with those guys. It resulted in this very, very beautiful experience where I got to have a bit more closure on something that means so much to me. Are you okay? I liked the idea that they show up helping Peter complete his arc and to make the right decision and maybe not make the mistakes that they made. But along the way, you know, they get some closure as well and some catharsis on their story lines. I love you guys. Thank you. Thank you. All right, let's do this. Let's go. Pumpkin bomb. I love me some Spider-Man, but I freaking love all the crazy villains. You know what I mean? The Green Goblin, Electro, that disco-ball-headed guy with the Mexican wrestling name. - My name is Mysterio. - Cool name. They're super cool bad guys, no doubt, but they are even cooler thanks to the amazing actors who played them. I think the beauty of these franchises is that the fact that you have such talented actors. With all these guys, you can't miss. The Norman Osborn character is sort of a tragic figure and something I could get behind. It was fun to play that role. You know, I'm something of a scientist myself. Octavius knows what I can do. In a lesser environment, us as villains, we would just be functionaries. We would just be there to, you know, get the plot going. But here, we've got real story lines. They are real people. In the first film, you had crazy-eyed Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin... wearing that emerald nightmare right over there. I love that outfit. I'll wear it to a nightclub. Iconic. You want to know the truth? Nobody knows how uncomfortable those costumes are. We had the amazing performance from Alfred Molina as Doc Ock. It's been very nice to come back to something that is familiar, but, at the same time, completely new. Looks like we got competition. There's some real depth to it, and that's what makes them interesting. I'm sorry what was your name again? Dr. Otto Octavius. No. There's no way your name's Dr. Otto Octavius. Wait, seriously? Cut. We met Venom for the first time. Ooh. Thomas Haden Church played a killer Sandman too, looking like he came straight out of the comic book. Or the beach. We were treated to Rhys Ifans as the Lizard. A quick cameo from Paul Giamatti as the Rhino... Jamie Fox as Electro. You got a lot of great minds here, man. When you have that type of dynamite, that type of TNT, I mean, people are gonna go along for the ride. I think people are gonna marvel... Oh! Man! And poor Dane DeHaan literally fell apart to become the new Green Goblin. But how are you gonna top Michael freaking Keaton as Vulture? Can't be done! He was so intimidating, it required no acting on my behalf because I'm just meant to be terrified. There is no one who could play that role better than he could. I thought this was the antigravity gun. No, that's that one. Oh, come on. Jake Gyllenhaal also totally nailed his turn as Mysterio in Far From Home. At first you're like, "Aw. What an amazing mentor and friend he is." And the next thing you know, he's ordering a drone strike on you and your friends. Oh, It happened. I was there. Kill that witch! I love the idea of putting a bunch of rogue villains together and just watching them meet each other and hang out and talk. You know I can give you a real makeover. Let me guess, into a lizard? Exactly. Would you two just shut up? I've never really seen that. I don't think any of the actors were coming for a cameo. I think that they were all coming to tell another chapter of their characters' story. You want to play games? You can't get better than Alfred Molina as Doc Ock. If you were ever gonna bring Doc Ock back, it would have to be Alfred Molina. And we realized that, thanks to the MCU, there's a way to do that. And that's what No Way Home is doing... Paying honor, in a very direct way, to the Spidey films that have come before. I think I can say this for all of us, we're all fans. And it's a wonderful world to be in. And if I say so myself, we're having a lot of fun. The wonderful thing about working on these movies is that we have been working with unparalleled actors. I mean, actors are everything. We live in an amazing time in history, people, where we've been gifted not one, but two Mary Jane Watsons in our lives. The always charming Kirsten Dunst played her in the initial trilogy, providing us with a wonderful performance and perhaps one of the most iconic screen kisses of all time. Yeah, man, I like my movie kisses wet and hanging upside down. Okay. Our costar Zendaya would eventually take the MJ mantle in the most recent films, bringing a very funny, more modern spin. I don't wanna celebrate something that was built by slaves. Oh, I'm sure the Washington Monument wasn't built by... Okay. Enjoy your book. Think I wanna be done now! - But we never got to see the kiss again. - Never, never doing that again. Well, I don't know about that. We also had two Gwen Stacys make it into the films. First, Bryce Dallas Howard appeared in the role in Spider-Man 3. But it was the Emma Stone version from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 that met with the same fate as her comic book counterpart. You can't be here right now. This is insane! Okay, guess what! This is my choice. This is mine. And what Spider-Man story would be complete without mentioning Aunt May? - What's going on in there? - Peter's beloved mother figure. First, we had the great Rosemary Harris playing a quintessential white-haired version of Aunt May. Then they went out and got Sally Field. - A legend. - Phew! Absolutely, a legend. And then in our films, we get the incredible Marisa Tomei... Oh, my... who flipped my perception of the character on its head. She really was kind of like my aunt. And we have this kind of familial connection to each other. That was great. And no discussion of Spider-Man's supporting characters would be complete without talking about J.K. Simmons' inspired performance as J. Jonah Jameson, editor-in-chief of the Daily Bugle and the ultimate Spider-Man troll. Spider-Man troll. I didn't try to base him on anything other than my take on the comic books. And then it was just roll the camera and bark. Could you pay me in advance? You serious? J.K.'s performance was so damn good in the original trilogy that they didn't even bother recasting the character when he shows up at the end of Far From Home, 'cause who wants to live in that flattop's shadow? There you have it, folks: Conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio. What a great time to be a Spider-Man fan. - That's right, folks. - Whoo-whee! "Spider-Man: Hero or Menace"? Three, two, one. Here we go. Behind every successful superhero film is a great director. And each of these Spider-Man film series have boasted a trio of talented filmmakers at the helm. Director Sam Raimi got first crack at bringing everybody's favorite wall crawler to life. Ready, and action. I love Sam Raimi. As a young filmmaker, you're seeing someone do something that is so entertaining and so full of life and comedy and energy. Then you feel like you could do that too. - How'd you do that? - Work out. You know, eat your green vegetables. He won me over with his vision, like, instantly. Schools closed down so people could go see that movie. You know, nobody had ever seen Spider-Man swinging before. Obviously, there's a lot of humor. Sam loves to just torture his characters. Cut it now. Good. That was good. And then came Marc Webb. Already a successful music video director, Webb was handed the keys to The Amazing Spider-Man series. I love those movies, and I thought that Marc Webb had such great human talent. And then when we cast Andrew and Emma, I think he did a brilliant job with them. Good. Webb reimagined his Spider-M story from the ground up, surrounding Peter Parker with an award-winning supporting cast and then thrilling audiences by putting them right in the thick of the action. Marc is very, very generous, and he's a really creative, exciting director. Action! Next, we arrive - at our esteemed colleague, Mr. Jon Watts. - Yep, yep. Director of the three most recent Spider-Man films, Homecoming, Far From Home and the third installment, No Way Home, baby. Seeing him grow through Homecoming and then Far From Home, and now with No Way Home, which is by far the most ambitious Spider-Man film ever made, seeing how he's grown into that role is really amazing. Jon Watts has done such a wonderful job of creating this genre of superhero movie that kind of hasn't been told before. - Jon is amazing. - The weight of this film, he carries it so lightly. Great. Cut. Yeah! His ability to combine humor, humanity and spectacular action has helped propel the recent films to all-new heights. Going up! It's not like they are these little stand-alone stories either. They also have to honor the bigger MCU story lines going on in the background too. I can't believe I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum. Neither can I. - Give me the box. - No. Jon Watts, he has this thing where he'll say "one more" for every take, and then you'll do 20 more takes. - One more. - One more. - One more. - One, one, one, one more. One more means one more when you're on 22. Are you sure it's one more? Every time I say that now, I'm gonna get in trouble. Not in trouble. Put a dollar in the "one more" jar? Yeah. Got it. Moving on. Just kidding. - Spidey has hops. I could do that in my younger days. - I believe you. Each film series has taken its own stab at adapting Spidey's unique powers for film, resulting in some of the craziest action and stunts you're ever gonna see, requiring the lead actors to dive headlong into training, fight choreography and lots and lots of wirework. In the original trilogy, the VFX team blended large-scale practical effects with state-of-the-art digital effects from the time to give audiences their first glimpse at web swinging on the big screen. It also holds up too. And nowhere is that more apparent than in the absurdly cool subway scene from Spider-Man 2. You know, back in my day, I had to do a lot more practically. And it's just a lot easier now with what technology's able to do. Three, two, one, action! Ten years later, digital effects had advanced to the point where Marc Webb and his VFX team were able to drop you right into Spider-Man's POV in The Amazing Spider-Man for an even more immersive thrill ride through the streets of Manhattan. All right. Good. And cut. I thought about the nature of Spider-Man and how important it was for us to reinvent the language of Spider-Man. What have you got for me today, New York? But then, Homecoming gave us that incredible ferry disaster sequence... which gets one-upped by Spidey's epic midair battle with the Vulture on the surface of a stealth plane. Absolutely incredible. Safety first. Then in Far From Home, we get treated to these massive Elemental battles, but they turn out to be just an appetizer. And what about that sick Mysterio illusion sequence where he brings all of Peter Parker's inner fears to life? Zombie Tony Stark about to eat his brain! And then wham! He gets taken out by the Eurail. You hated to see it, but it had to happen. It blew my mind and made me question reality myself. This is Peter Parker, this is Peter Parker. Spider-Man, Spider-Man. They're mes from other universes. No, no. They're here to help. This is the wizard I was telling you about. From a choreography standpoint, it's interesting because Spider-Man's never fought with Spider-Man before. And I think what we want to try and explore is an element of us trying to figure each other out and figure out our each individual, unique styles of how to be Spider-Man. And the amazing thing about working with Marvel and Sony is that the sky's the limit with these films. There's no idea that's too crazy, so if you want to do a quadruple backflip over an electric zap or something, that can happen. So, it's so fun being able to just sit down, play with the stunt team and figure out how we're going to make this film bigger and better than anything before. No, I really think you should have a disguise. An effective one, but also one that's funny. The Spider-Man costume is probably, with no exaggeration, one of the best graphic design elements in the history of graphic design. So, are you gonna go into battle dressed as a cool youth pastor, or do you got your suit? We were talking about the idea of how cool it is to wear the Spider-Man suit. But in reality, it takes three people and five shoehorns and a lot of talcum powder and oil and, like, 45 minutes... Are you still using talcum powder? I'm still on the talc. The secret is... - Go on. - I'll tell you the secret later. We'll catch up. I figured it out. Can I just go back to the trick about putting on the suit? 'Cause this is practical stuff that I want to know. So, we have these plastic bags that I put over my feet. Ah, slippery. And then they slide right in. Slide in. The only thing is, you get mad sweaty feet. Tell me more about that. The Spidey suits you see in the movies are significantly better than the footy pajama versions I like to wear. Or-Or-Or I used to wear. Anyway, we thought it would be fun to take a look back at all the different Spider-Man suits that have graced the big screen. Man, it's crazy! What else can this suit do? What? First though, we got Tobey Maguire's red hoodie number from the original Spider-Man film. - You got my name wrong... - Get out there, you moron! Looks kind of like Banksy if he shopped at Marshalls. Spidey's gotta adjust his glasses. Tobey then gets an upgrade with an iconic red-and-blue suit that will last the entire first trilogy. Although it barely made it through an entire movie in one piece. And no need for web shooters cluttering up that drip. My man Tobey had organic web shooters, which is kinda nasty when you think about it. But it's also super cool. It's kind of like having a runny nose in your wrist. Later, in Spider-Man 3, you got a taste of the legendary black suit... - from the comic books. - Wow. For formal occasions, of course. Sometimes he might throw a bow tie on it. I don't know. Then came The Amazing Spider-Man, which debuted a new suit look with a more serious tone. This is the costume. This is the outfit. It's different. I mean, we're changing things up. Subdued colors, buggier eyes and Spider-Man's traditional mechanical web shooters on the wrists. A second suit dropped in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, brightening the colors, widening the eyes and adopting more of Spidey's classic comic book look. Those eyes, which are big, they're really... Those big, expressive, kind, friendly, white eyes that are such an important part of how people interact with Spider-Man and why they love Spider-Man. A minor upgrade? Whoa! Oh, my God! Put it on. Tom Holland's first suit was introduced when the character debuted in Captain America: Civil War. It was a sleek, modern nod to the classic Spidey look. Plus, it came with web shooters and also enhanced with all kinds of crazy Stark tech. In Homecoming, Tom also dons his nifty homemade prototype suit. What the hell are you wearing? Then we get to Tom's tricked-out Iron Spider look in Infinity Wa and Endgame, with those shiny, golden spider legs flying every which way. After that, Far From Home introduced another all-black outfit, aka the Night Monkey. - Whoo! - How's the suit? It's a little tight around the old web-shooter. Parker! Okay, I'll shut up. Later in the film, Peter designs an all-new suit with Stark tech... Okay. Resulting in the first-of-its-kind red-and-black variation. With all these suits, I can't wait to see what's next. You think your fancy new suit's gonna save you? The thing I'm proudest of is the fact that people of all ages seem to love Spider-Man. Take a quick look back at all of Stan's cameos from all the Spider-Man films. Stan Lee. Gone, but never forgotten. Excelsior. Look out! Hey! Shut that off! I was... Tell him it's my car! Don't make me come down there, you punk! Hey, Gary! How ya doing? Marjorie, how are you? Hey, I think I know that guy. You know, I guess one person can make a difference. Nuff said. Doing this show, Martin, one thing becomes pretty clear. What's that? When it comes to superheroes, Spider-Man is king. Okay. We've got three versions, eight films, countless box office records. The fact that this one character is capable of that much success for so long is a testament to the appeal of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's creation. But we ain't done, Martin. We're not? No. Even though every Spider-Man film series has taken the character down a different road, now all these roads lead to one place. - Hmm. Where's that? - Spider-Man: No Way Home. The culmination of two decades worth of hard work, creativity and some intense gymnastics. - Dude! - Dude! Dude! - You ready? - I'm ready. I don't know about you, man, but my juices are flowing. Yeah, right there with you, buddy. We hope that you enjoyed this trip down Spider-Man movie memory lane as much as we enjoyed putting this thing together with the help of some very talented people. It's all effort and personal sacrifice. With great power comes great responsibility. You're now locked and loaded for Spider-Man: No Way Home. You can thank us later. You're welcome. Do it for yourself, but also do it for us, after all we've been through this last half an hour. Plus, Daddy's STARmeter needs some boost. Spidey fans, look the guy up. He's J.B. Smoove. And this guy here is Martin Starr. Thanks for watching. What are you spraying? What are you doing? We lost him.
