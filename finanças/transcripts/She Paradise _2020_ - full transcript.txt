How you get into this? I started to leave home plenty and dance was the first thing I find. You mean running away? Yeah... Ma and daddy used to quarrel a lot. But before dance, I had love fashion. Mummy had bought me this little sewing kit and I used to make dresses out of old t-shirts. I used to try and make them sit down and watch me dance around for a fashion show, but they couldn't even sit together for more than 5 minutes. I just used to be there crying. So that's why I started to leave home. Here... take this top. No, wear it inside out. Like this. It's good luck. I like performing eh, but I really want to make resort wear and have models on runways. You know what I mean? Big runways. At least my mother teach me how to sew. I don't know my mom that well.

No. Well, I believe it have a community of Africans, right? Right. and they build an empire underwater - where they were born. - Right. They were born there? Because their pregnant mothers get throw overboard during the slave trade. Allyuh never see them videos of babies who does swim immediately when they born underwater? Well I must have missed the part of the video where they grow gills. Just leave it. Oh Mica. Not everything is as we see it in this world you know. Another one of these, and I just might believe you.

I feel like you have the right vibe for the video you know. But I'm not really a good dancer. Yeah but it is not about that. It's about the energy, you know. Not just the dance. It's about the vibe. Transcending the experience, you know Yeah, I could totally relate to that. I want to hear Sparkle's thoughts on it. Take a walk with me nah. This is Sparkle. Hi. See that neighborhood across there?
