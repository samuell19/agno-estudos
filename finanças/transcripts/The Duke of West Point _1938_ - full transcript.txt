Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes I believe it's a penalty. No, no, it's an out of bounds. Holden playing. Early takes it again! Just Steve Early to make his exit from Cambridge in a blaze of glory. The Americans have a word for him: colossal. Righto! The final moments of the Oxford versus Cambridge rugger match... ...broadcast for the entire British Empire. The score is nought for Oxford and nought for Cambridge... ...after 85 minutes of terrific play by both the teams. Cambridge, fighting desperately, has been kept in the going only through the magnificent play of Mr. Steven Early, the sensational American, who is playing his last game for Cambridge. He's going to score! It's the end of the match. Mr. Steven Early, 3, Oxford, nought. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our departing hero. Old Steve, who's spurning civilization to return to the land of the Red Indians, the galloping buffalos, the swing bands, the, er... By the way, why are you going, Steve? Duty, honor, tradition, and stuff like that. It wasn't bad for my colleague running off just after downing Oxford. Like... like barging off from a dinner party. - Will you miss me? - Oh, dreadfully, Stephen. Don't go away, I'll be right back. In four years. Come in, Steven, come in. Good evening, sir. It's very nice of you, Steven, to remember me in the midst of your triumph. Not at all, sir. - You're sailing tonight, of course. - Hm, Queen Mary, Southampton. We'll be lonely without you, son. Four years... We're not going to have a scene, are we? Not two old soldiers like us. Rotten form, really. I'm just a little worried about you, Sreve. You're going into a difficult world. And I'm wondering how you're going to fit. I'll hold up my end, sir. You'll find yourself surrounded by two thousand typical American boys. And... you're not a typical American boy. Oh, really? Aren't you forgetting the five generations of Earlys who've been West Pointers, ...and the jolly old Mayflower and all that? You're banking on them heavily. You're going to need them. I promise to keep the Early escutcheon forever untarnished. I know you will. Well... that brings us to goodbye, doesn't it? Not goodbye, sir, just au revoir. Goodbye, Steve. - The very best. - Goodbye, sir. And... if it's not being unmilitary, I'd like to say that you're my favorite father. I'll overlook the familiarity. Now will you get out of here. Harris, John. Check. Stand over there. Albright, Henry. Check. Stand over there. Just put my kit down anywhere. I say, old boy, can you direct me to the superintendent? Ask that man over there, duke. He seems to be the bigshot. I beg your pardon. That's English you're speaking, isn't it? - It ain't double talk. - One likes to be sure, doesn't one? How do you like that guy? Is it English? Maybe he's a spy. Anderson, Harry. Check. Stand over there. I say, old man. Am I alright for the Superintendent? What? I'm instructed to report to the superintendent... ...of the United States Military Academy. What do you think those men are waiting for, home relief? Early, Steven. Check. Stand over there. Next. Bell, Frank. Check. Stand over there. Well, I'd like to arrange for a batman to bring my kit along. - A what, to do what? - A batman, a porter. To carry my luggage. You'll have to carry your own bag, son. This is the army. Not all of it, I hope. Well, here we are. In a good, substancial-looking place. Oh, Owen, it looks so grim. - Huh? - Oh, not a bit homelike. I just know that Sonny will be homesick or something. Aw, I will not. No matter what anybody tells you, we saw it first. Somebody may beat us to it. Come on! Say, sonny, where'll I find... Look, where'll I find the general? I want to talk to him about Sonny. As members of... shall we say reception committee, in charge of receiving the incoming class, sir, we'd be very glad to have talk to us about Sonny. Well, now, that's right nice of you boys. Isn't it, Mother? Oh, yes, I think it's awfully nice of you to take such an interest in Sonny. Oh, it's a pleasure, ma'am. You just leave Sonny to us. Gee, fellas, thanks. Pick up the bags, Sonny. Glad to have seen you, sir. Left face! Goodbye, Mom. Goodbye, Da... Goodbye, Sonny. Goodbye, dear. - I'm so glad he's met such nice boys. - Yeah. Why don't you get up braced, Mr. Dumb Guard? Chest up! Eyes straight ahead! Chin right back! Eyes straight, halt! Left detail! Attention! Suck in those stomachs. Pull in those chins! Brace those shoulders! Stand up, you question marks! Mr. Strong, this is Sonny. - Hello, fellas! - Get in ranks. - But Sonny belongs to us. - You're welcome to him. It had to happen, I suppose. There's a Sonny in every plebe class. Isn't he beautiful? I dislike to disarrange such a perfect picture, Mr. Rains. - But the hat. - Yes, I thought so too. She loves me, she loves me not. She loves me... You know, I never was quite sure about that blonde, Mr. Rains. - Blondes are indeed fickle, Mr. Grady. - She loves me not. Thank you, Mr. Strong. Roll up those trousers. Take off that horse blanket. - What? - Climb out of that coat. Ah, an athlete. - Er, yes sir. - Football? - Yes, sir. - I'll bet you were captain of the team. Yes, sir. - And scored all the touchdowns. - I'd say he's a jolly good football player. How did you get in here? Quite easily, really. Presidential appointment. Is that so? Where did you get that accent? Perhaps it comes from having spent eight years at school in England. The last two at Cambridge. Cambridge? Yes, a university attended by... gentlemen. Maybe you're a football player too. Oh, quite, sir. I was rather fancied as a scrum half. - A what? - That's in rugger. Rugger? My word, Mr. Rains. We'll have to look into this. Wipe those silly smirks off your faces! Is there anything else you do? Oh, yes. I swim, golf, tennis... - Row, cricket, soc... - He crickets, Mr. Grady! Can you bake a cake? I forgot to mention, sir, that I could box. - You mean fight with the hands? - Quite. I suppose you're an expert at that too. I doubt if I shall ever have the opportunity to prove to you personally my... ...pugilistic expertness. - Really? Why not, Mr. Limey? - Because of those chevrons, sir. You probably sleep in them. I have a hunch you're not going to last long around here, Mr. Limey. I've seen plebes like you before. A little too high-class for this place. You're doing the army a favor. And a little too smart too, if you get what I mean. But, while you are here, it's going to be a pleasure for me to have you on the B-squad. Thank you, sir. I'm looking forward to it. Before I assign you men to rooms, I desire to point out a few facts of life. You've been given a copy of Bugle Notes, which is a manual governing the conduct of plebes. From it you will learn that no plebe is permitted to smoke outside his room, or appear outside his room without correct uniform. A plebe must ascend and descend stairs two at a time. A plebe must enter and leave barracks by the basement door, never by the front door. In fact, Mr. Dumb Guard, you know what a plebe ranks? Sir, a plebe ranks the superintendent's dog, the commandant's cat, the waiters in the mess hall, the Hell Cats... ...and all the admirals in the whole darn navy. Where did you learn that? I learned the whole plebe manual by heart, sir, before I came here. Right face! Forward, double-time, march! Pick up those bags! Duke, what you need is a guy with a strong back and a weak mind. - That's me. - What I need is an octopus. Detail, halt! Three of you men will occupy a room. The last three men in this line take this room. You three men take that room. Forward! Double time! March! Detail! Halt! - Homely little place, isn't it. - So cheery. Oh, we'll get used to it, Duke. Lots of others have before us. Thanks awfully for helping me with my kit. Oh, think nothing of it. I was traveling light. Park yourself in that upper bunk, Sonny. Thanks. Say, you sort of overdid it with that yearling corporal, didn't you? I thought he was bearing down too hard on that chap Drew. He was. You know, it may be our solemn duty to adopt that little squirt. He might get lost or something. I was thinking of that myself. Well, I guess it's fate, or maybe it's the mother instinct in me. My son, you're about to perform your first great sacrifice. Huh? See you later. Gentlemen, I should like to propose a business transaction. I have here a particularly fine specimen of young manhood. Sound in wind and limb and guaranteed to be gentle and kind to his mother. I'm going to trade him free and unencumbered in return for... this. No, no, no, don't thank me. I just thought that he was just more your type. So long fellows, I'm sorry I have to go... Park yourself on that upper bunk, sonny. - Well, I got him. - Gee, fellas, thanks. My name's West, John West. I'm from Michigan. I'm Steve Early. So, you're going to be my military wife for four years. Not exactly a raving beauty, but a husky-looking wench. I'm Robert Drew. How do you do? I'm going to be a military wife too. It's a very beautiful thought, Sonny. But you can never be more than a sister to me. Look at him, he isn't dumb, not even in these barracks. Gentlemen, meet my grandfather. A most remarkable man. - Grandfather, meet the gentlemen. - How do you do? Attention! Within the next four hours... you will draw articles of uniform equipment from the cadet store. Getting utensils necessary to the proper care of your room. You will learn to make a bed, police a room, arrange a locker and stand inspection. In addition, you will learn requirements of military courtesy. To salute properly, do dress aligned, to do squads right and left, to form a hollow square, to march in column and answer calls to formations. And just before retreat tonight, you will be sworn into the military service of the United States. See if you have that memorized, Sonny. My word, what an optimist. All men outside! - Silly, isn't it? - Uh-huh. I think informal introductions are so much nicer, don't you? You know? You're the first pleasant thing I've seen all day. If I knew when you'd pass here, I might drop in like this often. - Pick up that mattress, mister! - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. In a jiffy, sir. Very sorry, sir. A most charming lady, sir. Must be the chevron, sir. What's that? Well, sir, if it's not the chevron, sir, then we have no explanation, have we, sir? Who's he? A particularly poisonous specimen of plebe... ...complicated by a suet pudding accent. Really? What's his name? Plebes don't have names. Right Turn! Left Turn! March Halt! You will raise your right hands. You are about to take the oath of service and allegiance... ...which will make you members of the corps of cadets, United States Army. When I pause, at the proper place, each of you will utter his own name aloud. - I... - (names) do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States... ...and bear true allegiance to the national government; that I will maintain and defend the sovereignty of the United States... ...paramount to any and all allegiance. Gee, fellas, just think, we're in the army. I'd rather not think about it. I've been through enough the last four hours to be a major general. It reminds me of a rest home. It's so different. - Aren't you chaps tired? - Who me? Things move pretty fast. I haven't had a chance to think about being tired. Grandfather warned me it would be like this. Who's the handsome-looking gent with all the hardware? Oh, that's my father. I didn't know you were an army brat. Well, I'm not exactly. Say, that's a Distinguished Service Cross he's wearing. - Yeah. - Nothing like having a hero for a father. He was killed in action. Sorry, Jack. Say, I wonder what the idea is, a button on a string. Oh, that's your absence card. Everytime you go out of the room... ...you have to show where you are by that little button. Well, suppose you're someplace else when your... ...little button says you're someplace else? You better be where the little button says you are. You're on your honor to be there. And you can't go anywhere else until you come back and change the little button. You see, the honor system here is more than just a name. It's everything. You can get away with an offense against military discipline, but nobody yet has survived an offense against the honor code. You know, the army enforces the military code but the code of honor is enforced by your own classmates and by the corps. Now let that be a lesson to you. And listen. If they ever catch you with even one red cent in your pocket, it's the firing squad. You can't even mention money around here. Gee, fellas... Just think, maybe all them, the greatest men the army ever had, or "Lighthorse" Harry Wilson, or even Red Kegel lived right in this very room. Gee, aren't we lucky? Jake, don't you think we're... Aw... Aw, that's army spirit for you. Shut up and go away, we don't want any. Patch Webley, you'd better get out of bed. Hey, you've just got five minutes to be outside in the line. - Don't tell me it's another day. - Yessir! Dismissed! How can you study with all this going on? Tomorrow we go back into barracks. Academics come next week. I'm brushing up on Euclid. Euclid and I are just like that. Yeah, well Euclid and I are just like this. Go on, you're just a doughboy, huh? Sure, doughboys are the backbone of the service. XXX Uh-uh! The spirit of the carnival is creeping up on me. Adventure, romance, the slither of silk, the sizzle of champagne, the lure of lovely ladies. I think I'll go out and get better acquainted with Mr. Strong's girl. Now look, you go after that blonde with Strong... ...and you'll have half a dozen yearling corporals on your neck. Ah... Don't wait up for me, Jack. - Keep it Hawaiian, Mr. Drew. - Yes, sir. Now what? Pardon me. I'll only be a minute. Women and children first. Nothing to be afraid of. - This way, please. - But why? I don't understand... If you feel faint, I could carry you. Being able to take command of emergencies like this is what counts. Yes, I was right, you are beautiful. You see, I wasn't quite sure. The last time I saw you you were upside down. Well, what are you thinking. I'm thinking that you're conceited, fresh, a goldbrick and an army brat. That's rather an understatement, but let it pass. Your book of clippings must be enormous, Mr. Early. Cuttings is the word. No, I've never gone in for cuttings. It's such a waste of time. Perhaps you need an assistant. You know, to compile the personal history of Steve Early for posterity. Marvelous. I'll see you have a front-row seat for all my performances. Oh, there was one point you failed to cover in your survey. - Really? - Oh, yes. I have one weakness. Moonlight, sentiment, romance. One of my first duties, Mr. Early, will be to protect you against yourself. Ann, for the love of Pete, what happened to you? - Oh, it's you! - Yes, sir. Strange how I get about, isn't it? I was fortunate enough to rescue Miss, er... Ann in the confusion. Is that so. Mr. Early was showing me how beautiful the river looks from here. Oh, a beauty lover, eh? Look, Mr. Dumflicket. If I could prove the suspicion I have about you and those lights I'd... - Do you mind? - Not at all. Brace, Mister. Suppose you just stand there and admire the river... ...until called to quarters? Three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Come on. - Hello, you again? - Yes, it's me. You guys run like ??? Alright, backfield take over. Slumming, aren't you? Coming out to watch the plebes? No, just curiosity. I wanted to see the great Early. Why not arrange for a private showing? Alright, come on, come on. Get in there and show a little light. Lately I've had a lot of company. Most of them bow-legged. Well, if you're talking about Mr. Strong, you... "Bad News" Strong, we call him. What a shame he has to grow out of being a yearling corporal. He's so happy as he is. Come on, show a little light in there. Hold in, gang. Come on, let's do this. Fumble. There's a nice, soft green spot over there, Mr. Strong. Just the place for a quiet little nap. - Come on, let's go. - Come on, gang. You know, it must have been awfully dull for you before I came into your life. A blond island completely surrounded by Strongs. - What a life. - It has its moments. What does a 16-year-old know about moments? Eighteen! Nineteen tomorrow. I'd never believe it. You don't show your age at all. - I didn't know you were an army girl. - I'm not exactly... Hey, hey, hey, you want to catch pneumonia? Well, you look in pretty good shape. How much do you weigh? 175. Feel great. You know, there was a man in the 29th squad who looked just like you. It's Murray. He's hurt. He's just lovely to me. He's going to keep me in perfect shape all week. Until I can break a leg Saturday. He reminds me of Drew 20 years after. - Do you know who he is? - Sure, he's Doc. Why is it people like Doc never have second names? Doc's more than a trainer. He's an institution. He was a cadet. Never graduated. He failed academically his attacking classmen and had to resign. He's been here ever since as a trainer. I often wonder where the army got men like him. How come you're so interested? Maybe it's because he's my father. Johnny, come in! What's the matter with you? That's the third shiner you've had in two weeks. Don't you like yourself anymore? Well, it's my eye, isn't it? I guess I can get a shiner if I want to, can't I? - Must be rather monotonous. - Sure it is. I have to get black eyes so you guys can get touchdowns. - Well, somebody's got to be a scrum. - Not me. Look, the first team is only as good as the scrums are The harder the scrums the fight, the better the first team plays. Yes, but a scrum gets none of the glory, my friend. You never heard of a scrum dying for dear old alma mammy. I believe if you have to get a fractured skull, it's better to have as many people as possible witness your heroism. I remember at Cambridge I had 125.000 to my broken collar bone. I needed 200.000 to tend to my concussion. Yeah, well an army guy plays just as hard if nobody's watching. Oh, I remember you. Rugger, isn't it? A much more difficult game than American football. Quite, sir. In rugger there's no interference in front of the ball carrier. - Exactly. - So that when a man runs for a touchdown, A try is the word, sir. He runs through the opposing team all by himself. Very well explained, Mr. Strong. And as I remember, you were rather fancied as a... crummy half? Scrum half, sir. And doubtless on many occasions scored tries. Oh, on many occasions. Do you fancy you could run through an army team, Mr. Early? For a good old rousing try. It would seem very simple, sir. In football there are only eleven men on the side. In rugger there are fifteen. Please. Wait till I get out. Don't go away, I'll be right back. Aw gee, Duke, what's the matter with you? You're just in time. I've just been invited to run through an army team. You'll sure get yourself in some beautiful jam. Those guys out there will murder you! Come on, Mister Rugger, we're waiting. - Ready? - Oh, quite! - Who is that guy? - The name is Early, sir. Oh, the name is Early. Hey, hey, Early! Hey! Wait a minute, Early. I want to talk to you. Yes, sir. Walk along with me. Mr. Early, I desire to remind you... ...that plebes are not permitted to speak to, escort... ...or be in the company of ladies without being in correct uniform. And then only with special permission. - Do I make myself clear, Mr. Early? - Very, sir. Football practice is not the place. And football togs are not the uniform. Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. I'll ask Miss Porter not to speak publicly to me again. Mister Early, you seem to have missed the affection and esteem... ...the entire corps holds for Miss Porter. - And for Doc Porter. - Oh, not at all, sir. Nor the individual admiration Mr. Strong holds for Miss Porter. I think she's wonderful. It's her birthday today. I'm thinking of giving her a party, a surprise party. On the steps of Grand Hall, I suppose. Oh no, sir. At our house. Tonight. You know, the second house to the right beyond the gym? Don't be silly. Plebes can't visit anyone at night without special permission. Mr. Strong, I'm afraid you're too busy being a yearling corporal. A girl like Ann needs romance. Halt! I'm not through with you yet. I seem to remember, Mr. Early, you once deplored the fact that you couldn't prove to me... ...your pugilistic... expertence. Oh, quite, sir. It was the chevrons, wasn't it, sir? - Good morning, Mr. Strong. - Good morning, sir. I think I'll give you an opportunity to prove to me just how good you are. Suppose you follow me, Mr. Early. With pleasure, sir. Does that make you feel better, Mr. Early? Very much, sir. Before you begin the demonstration, I suppose I should tell you. I'm the heavy-weight boxing champion of the academy. Really? Material must be very scarce. I didn't think I'd need the chevrons. I wouldn't say that, sir. - A surprise party, you said? - Yes, but one man's surprise party. Would you like to send a gift? You go absent from quarters and there'll be a surprise party... ...waiting for you when you get back. - With the chevrons, I suppose. - You said it! I wouldn't go down there if I were you. Strong is giving a little extra instruction on the proper conduct of a plebe. - Who? - Mr. Early. - It's about time. - Attention! - What's going on here? - Boxing, sir. Mr. Early and I were warming each other up. The gym is the place for boxing, Mr. Strong. Yes, sir. See that you make use of it in the future. Yes, sir. Hey, Steve, you'd better stop fussing around. Taps will go in a minute. Oh, don't rush me. There's plenty of time. 12A, Taps! Lights out. - 24! - All right, sir. - 23! - Those the clothes you're gonna sleep in? - Sure, I'm practicing to be a soldier. - Quit clowning, will you? As soon as I give the alright you're gonna have to stay like that all night. - 22! - All right, sir. - 21! - All right, sir. - 14. - All right, sir. - 13. - All right, sir. Okay. Get a load of the Duke. You might think he was going somewhere. I am. I'm going to call on Miss Porter. It's her birthday. Are you crazy? You mean you're going absent from quarters? You can't do that. Suppose you get caught. Did I ever tell you about my grandfather? The most remarkable man. He was never caught. You'd better be as smart as your grandfather... ...or you'll be an area bird instead of a football player. Remember Strong is subdivision inspector tonight. That's all right, I told him I was going. You... That makes it a sporting proposition. Yeah... some fun. Don't wait up for me. - Good night. - Goodbye, Ann, happy birthday. I'll call you two for a beer so we can get together again soon. I just love getting presents. - Goodbye. - Good night. Hello. I, er... decided to bring the phonograph. I don't sing so well. What are you doing here? It's your birthday, isn't it? Aren't you suprised? Well, I probably should be, but I'm not. I don't think anything the great Early could do would surprise me. Fine, now we're beginning to understand each other. I hope my being late didn't dampen the festivities. I was unavoidably detained. Couldn't find the key to the basement door. It must have been quite a dangerous expedition. It would have been if the enemy had been awake. Napoleon, Alexander the Great, Hannibal. They loved danger. All great soldiers love danger. Hannibal, crossed de Alps. Early, crossed the plain. If you're not careful, you'll be crossing the Hudson on the way home. This is very nice of you. I really didn't expect it, though. Oh. Could someone have given you just what I always wanted? It might interest you to know that Mr. Strong gave me that frame. Mr. Strong? Oh, yes, lovely chap. So thoughtful, too. Just the right size to fit in the locker. Uh-uh, I believe in fair exchange. I suppose you never thought of what would happen to me... ...if someone should come in here and find... us. Of course I have. We'd announce our engagement immediately. At a time like this he has to go Romeo on us. I'd like to guzzle him. I've guzzled him four times in the last four minutes. What are you thinking about now? I think you're fresh... I know, conceited, a goldbrick and an army brat. - Oh, pardon me, have one. - Thank you. - Oh, I don't think that you ought to... - Three thousand ways to boil and egg... ...or whatever young girls should know. Hm, I'm glad you appointed yourself custodian of my personal history. As far as I'm concerned, it ends right here. You're wrong, it's just started. But I'll see you get plenty more to keep this one company. They'll make such nice reading on those long winter nights. I suppose you have it all figured out... ...what you're going to do in the event they catch you and kick you out. Oh, yes, I've decided to let my hair grow in. We'll go back to England. You'll like England. You're doing your best to make me wish I'd never heard of it. I think I'm going to kiss you. - Oh, thanks for the warning. - Uh-uh. All little girls get kissed on their birthdays. Are you expecting someone? - No, but I thought you might be. - What at this time of night? It's Father. - Oh, you're back early. - Early? - That is, er... soon. - Soon? How long did you think it would take me to drive the major and his wife home? Well, I was hoping that it... You've had too much excitement for one day, young lady. What you need is bed. You're missing your beauty sleep. But, uh... Ah, that's what I like. Plenty of fresh air. Good night, darling. - Happy birthday. - You'll never know. Relax, it's me. Alright, you guys, back to your rooms. Ahh... Romance. As I was saying... Ah, romance. ...five and six! Well, I didn't know you two cared. Steve! Hey, I got a two seven in Math! - Boy, is that a load off my mind! - Shake hands with a millionaire. I'll be in their block against Harvard Saturday. That's great, congratulations. Wish come true for a fellow who works hard, lives right, is nice to his mother... Oh, speaking of Mother. I brought this over for you. - From home, isn't it? - Thanks. This isn't from Mother, it's from the church. That's funny. Probably the sons and daughters have widened their eyes wanting their back dues. - Is something the matter? - What's her name? I know a good lawyer. I guess I'll need more than a lawyer. Cut your clowning. It isn't exactly a surprise to me. I've been expecting it. I knew she couldn't make it. - What are you gonna do? - Only thing I can do. - Resign, go home. - Oh, you can't do that, we're playing Harvard Saturday. Don't worry. You'll win without me. You mean to say you're going to walk out of here and resign... ...without even getting in touch with your mother? You don't know my mother, Steve. She isn't the kind to holler for help. All our lives Mother's fixed things so I came first. It wasn't easy because we didn't have much. She kept me in school... ...just because she knew how much it meant to me to come here. I guess I've been a little selfish. But... well, I thought I could make it up to her after I graduated. It can't wait now. Mother's got to come first. How much would she need to pull it through? At least a thousand bucks. You mean to tell me you're going to give up everything you've worked so hard to get... ...for a silly thousand dollars? A thousand dollars isn't silly, Steve, ...to a guy that's never had more than ten bucks at one time in his whole life. I think it's silly. I know lots of people who have a thousand dollars. - I know lots of people who haven't. - I think you're silly. Suppose you do resign and then you find out that this letter is a false alarm? Sure, Steve is right. If you resign, you're through. You'll make a bum second lieutenant, ready to give up... ...before you even know the strength of the enemy. Will you promise me something? Will you send your mother a telegram? She'll let you know the truth. Sure, and I can get that money from my dad just like that. Thanks, but I couldn't accept it. I'll tell you what we'll do. Right after recall this afternoon... ...we'll send your mother a telegram. You'll get an answer in the morning and if she says she needs you... Well, Sonny and I will help you resign. - Is that common sense? - You said it. Well... alright, I'll wire her this afternoon. Brace those shoulders! Pull in those chins! Suck in those stomachs! Stand up, you question marks! I might as well make a phone call while I'm here. I want to speak to Mr. Hayes, National City Bank, New York. Reverse charges, please. Ask her right out if you have to come home. Mr. Hayes, I want you to wire me $1.020... ...to Western Union, Highland Falls, New York, right away. You aren't in difficulty, are you, Steven? Oh no, not at all. I just want to make a little business investment. And I don't want any of the bank's advice. All right, I'll take care of it immediately, Steven. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. - Well, did you send it? - Yeah. It's gone. Aw, gee, Steve, you're not gonna pull that stunt again, are you? - Stunt? - Steve, why don't you act grown-up? This may be my last night. The cavalier in me demands action. Every TAC and cadet officer in the place is laying for you. Did I ever tell you about my grandfather? - Aw... - I ought to clip you right on the jaw... ...and put you to bed. Look, Steve, nobody's worth the chances your taking. Wrong again, Sonny. I know somebody who's worth it. Oh, and don't wait up for me. - Can you identify yourself, Mr. Early? - Oh, certainly. I'll have to give you a check. It's too late to pay you in cash. I don't want the money. I want you to transfer it... ...to the address on this telegram. Steven! In civilian clothes. Oh, it's nothing really. Just a few things I keep in town for emergencies. Young lady, what are you doing out at this time of night? Someone else is having a birthday I suppose. No, not exactly. "Neon Steve" they call me. Seems my lot to go around spreading happiness and light. Unselfish, unspoiled, untouched by human hands. Well, almost untouched. Unselfish? I don't suppose you ever had a thought for anyone else... ...but yourself in your whole life. Oh, I didn't, eh? Well, just remember, if I get busted in Math this month it's your fault. And who's to blame for your committing a dismissal offense at this time of night? What's the matter? It's only eleven o'clock. It wouldn't be fun if you were just making a fool of yourself. But when you're making fools of men who trust you and believe in you... that's tragic. You're not fit to know those men. You laugh at them just as you laugh at me. Oh, you're wrong there. Most of the time I'm laughing at myself. You have a queer sense of humor. Your classmates are playing Harvard Saturday and they need you to win. And you betray their trust. I hope they catch you. I hope they kick you out. That probably would throw you into stitches. If you can climb a wall, I'll see you home. No, thanks. I'm probably mistaken, but I just saw a young chap with a girl... ...in front of the Western Union office who is Mr. Early or his double. I'll check cadet Early at once, sir. Relax, relax, it's me. Nothing like a brisk walk in the night air to get rid of that sleepy feeling. Good evening, Mr. Early. I hope you've had an enjoyable outing. Oh, quite, sir. Nice of you to wait up for me. The pleasure was all mine. You know, I was just sitting here wondering... ...what your grandfather would do at a time like this. - Social engagement, I presume. - Not at all. Business. - It must have been very important business. - Very. Mr. Early, were you or were you not in front of the Western Union office... ...in Highland Falls at approximately 11:00 tonight? No, sir. You wish to change that statement, Mr. Early? No, sir. It's too bad you won't be playing against Harvard Saturday. You probably would have been sensational. Thank you, sir. I'm sure I would have been. I've seen a lot of guys like you. Guys who could dish it out beautifully. But there was only one trouble with them. They never learned how to take it. I hope you can take it, Mr. Early. In big doses. I'll be looking forward to the experiment, sir. - Good night, Mr. Early. - Good night, sir. - I'm sorry I didn't slug you. - Gee, what are you going to do now? Me? I'm going to bed. - Bed? - Sure, haven't you heard? There's nothing like a good night's sleep. So, look at you two birds. One would think that you were going in front of the Army Committee. What are you gonna tell them? Oh, I think I'll plead, er... self-defense. Yeah, that's just the trouble. You haven't got a defense. Maybe I can think one up on the way over. Here's a telegram for you, Mr. West. Thank you, sir. Well, go ahead, open it. What does she say? Sorry you were alarmed. No cause for worry. It's alright! Everything's alright! See, I told you that yesterday. Oh, go on, you're no swami. You didn't know she could fix it up. Say, maybe she got the money from the bank. Oh, sure, banks are the nicest people. Oh, gee, that's swell. Hey, Duke. You know, all we gotta worry about now is you. Mr. Early, do you desire to make a statement in your defense? No, sir. Mr. Early, you have been reported for uttering a falsehood... ...in answer to a question in the line of duty in violation of the honor code. To you, Mr. Early, the honor code may seem childish. but to the men who have worn the uniform of the corps, from the generals of the army to the lowliest plebe goat, it represents the cornerstone and strength of the United States Army. There has never been a place for a liar in this institution. Honesty is not a surface quality, Mr. Early. We know that since your entrance here you have not been honest with the corps, your classmates or yourself. Ordinarily, Mr. Early, the disposal of a case such as yours would not be difficult. This honor committee made up of your fellow cadets... ...would report its findings to the superintendent of the academy. You would then be tried by the proper authority and dismissed from the corps. Your father is an officer and a gentleman in the highest sense of the word. We would like to spare him and those members of your family... ...who preceded you here the shame which must follow your official disgrace. Mr. Early, the committee suggests that you resign. And if I chose not to resign? We are sure such a choice would be most unfortunate. I dislike to inflict my presence upon you, gentlemen, but as you reminded me, each generation of my family... ...has graduated a son from this institution. I cannot bring myself to break such a tradition. Very well, Mr. Early, you may go. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Watkins and Jones, report to the Guard House. - Look at him out there. Clowning. - He doesn't fool me. It may look like clowning, but Steve wouldn't have missed... ...this game for a million bucks. It won't even sound like a football game without Steve. Sixty-six hours extra duty. Let's see, he can walk two off on Wednesday, two off on Saturday, that's four hours a week. Four to six... Aw, gee, that's an awful lot of walking. Bob, while you were outside the room just now they passed the word along. - Steve is silenced. - Oh no, they can't do that. Not to Steve. Four years inside these walls... ...having to live among two thousand men who won't speak to him. Or even admit that he exists. You mean we have to stop talking to him too? That's for us to decide. As his room mates we can talk to him. Well, I don't have to decide anything. - I'll talk to him. - Yeah, same here. Well, we'd better get ready for the game. Hey, brothers, remember those Harvard guys wear the crimson jersey. Don't forget that 17b play. Miles tries to tackle and... Hey, I've got a great idea for you. When you... Boy, are they burned up over a little thing like a football game. Maybe it's a lot of little things. So, nobody's going to talk to me for the next three and a half years. Isn't that just ducky. Well, that's no punishment. It's been awfully tough trying to talk to a bunch of yokels... ...whose conversation was limited to gee and aw before they came here. Well, what are you waiting for? Are you going to move or shall I? - Move? - Sure! You can't live with a guy who has military B.O. We're not going to move, Steve. We kind of like it here. Sure, southern exposure and everything. - It's not so easy to divorce your wife... - Two wives! Well... it's okay with me but... I think you're asking for a lot of grief. Steve, you know we wouldn't go back on you. I suppose you guys don't believe in Santa Claus. He'll have an awful time passing by the sentries. Christmas comes but once a year. And when it comes it is only the 25th of December, to the plebes. Back in London the Colonel is sitting in solemn grandeur in front of the Yule log. A hot toddy in his hand. I cabled him Christmas greeting number 12A. He'll like that. This is the first time I've ever been away from home on Christmas. Back there everything is white snow and green pine trees. The air when you breathe it... sort of explodes inside of you. My mother makes the best turkey dressing you ever stuck a fork into. Well, if Christmas procceds according to regulations, you can stick that fork in an iced pad of slump, and hope for the best. Just a couple of pessimists. The trouble with you fellows is you don't believe in Santa Claus. Oh, wait a minute... No! Fellas, no, what are you gonna do to me? Wait a minute! No, no, no... Now you stay right there, Sonny, and wait for Santa Claus. We don't want to miss him. Come on, let me down. It's dark up here. How do you like that little monkey, getting up while we're asleep and filling our socks? He just forgot to grow up. Where is he now? Someone called him on the phone. Look, I got to go down to the Hotel. Somebody wants to see me. Come on fellows, walk down with me. We can make it before dinner formation. - Who is it? - I don't know, it was woman's voice. A woman? We'd better go with him! We ought to investigate this business of Sonny... ...talking to strange women over the telephone. Merry Christmas, Jack, some fun, eh? Merry Christmas, dynamite, what did Santa Claus bring you? Oh, lots of things, thanks, Jim. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Drew. Merry Christmas. Well, at least it's Christmas. They can't play around with that. - Sonny! - Oh, darling, darling, darling! Oh... Oh, my... how you've grown! I hardly know you! Look at him, Owen, isn't he handsome in that uniform? Oh, fellows, this is my mother... and my father. This is Steve Early and this is John West. Oh, Mr. Early, I'm so glad to meet you. Sonny has written me all about your practicing to be a diplomat. Oh, I just adore kings, don't you? I don't know, I never met one. That's just what I like about them, they're so exclusive. Oh, anybody can meet a president. Well, well, you look fit as a fiddle. How are they treating you? - Oh, swell, Dad. - Good. - Er, let's eat! - Yes, surely! You know, I can't get over how he looks in a uniform. Isn't he beautiful? - John! - Mother! These are the guys who didn't believe in Santa Claus. It was Sonny's idea, John. He knew we were coming for Christmas. So he insisted that we bring your mother. We'd have brought your father too, only... I'm such a poor sailor. Oh, isn't it thoughtful of them? To have a splendid hotel like this right on the grounds... ...just so we mothers can visit our sons. Well, come on, let's eat, huh? You sit right there, Mrs. West. - Sonny, you go along with Mother. - Alright, Dad. Steven, you sit right there. Oh, boy! Don't anybody disturb me for the next half hour. - We don't turkeys in the army. - I'll have somebody send you a nice one. Oh, but look, darling, you're not eating anything. Now please, please. Ma! Gee, for a minute there I thought it had me licked! Hey, what's the matter, Duke? Oh, I... I think I need a little fresh air. Do you mind? I know Sonny's just dying to tell you all about the army. Oh, not at all, Steven. You know, darling, just as soon as I can I'm going to get a nice chocolate cake... ...and Owen and I are going to send it to you... Excuse me. You don't mind, do you Steven? I wanted to have a talk with you. No, no, of course not. You know, I feel as if I've known you always. John has written to me so much about you. I'm sure it must have been very uninteresting. I'm so glad he found someone like you, dear. He's had so few friends. You'll never know what you've done for him, Steven. What it's meant to him to stay here. He never knew his father. He never even saw him. He's just dreamed. And ever since he's been a liitle bit of a boy he's marched towards that dream. It's Christmas. I wish you'd let me tell him, Steven. Let's not tell him now, Mother West. He'd have queer ideas about paying me back. It might spoil things. I wouldn't have that happen for the world. God bless you, Steven. And Merry Christmas. Cutting in, Mr. Strong. Please! Thank you. I had a great desire to look at you and say Merry Christmas. Do you mind? No, I don't mind. Merry Christmas, Steve. What made you decide to deliver your Christmas greeting in person? Oh, maybe it's because I'm sending so few this year. Thank you. Merry Christmas, Mr. Strong. Coach, it's the best-looking plebe squad in years. Why, Doc, that's what you said about last year's plebes. Did I? - Coach, can I talk to you? - What is it? Sir, I understand a man's place on any army team... ...depends entirely upon his ability as a player. That's correct, Mr. Early. Sir, I'd like to offer myself as a candidate for the plebe hockey squad. As you probably know, sir, I'm socially unacceptable to the corps. It won't interfere with my ability as a player. In fact, it may have the opposite effect. Hockey is not entirely a pleasant pastime, Mr. Early. I understand, sir. Any man eligible for the sport has a right to try for a place in the team. - Yes, sir. - Doc. - Issue Mr. Early hockey equipment. - Yes, sir. The trainer will take care of you, Mr. Early. Thank you, sir. In case of accident or sudden death, don't bother. Are you sure those skates fit? Can I have your attention, please, men? Gentlemen, a season without a defeat brings a gloat to the heart of any coach. And a regret that the last game has been played. I look forward to next season with keen anticipation. I believe the army will be represented by its greatest squad. To those men on this squad who have borne the burden of the battle... ...and shared a little of the glory, I can only say if it hadn't been for you, there would have been no glory for anyone. The athletic association has permitted me the pleasure of bestowing... ...class numerals on members of this squad who have earned them. As your names are called, will you please step forward and take your certificate? West, John. Johnson, Charles W. Early, Steven. Thank you, sir. Shannon, Jack. Look at him, he's trying to wear out those books. - Say, listen, who's top of the class? - You are, you are. Alright, I intend to stay there. Boy, just one more hour and we'll be yearlings. Gee, I can hardly wait. Hey, listen to this. Suck in that stomach! Pull in that chin! What's your name, mister? - I've been practicing to myself. - Don't worry, I'll keep it a secret. Aw... Gee! We march back right after graduation parading in the area. The whole corps. And then we won't be plebes anymore. - We'll be recognized. - For what? - For what? - Stop riding him, Duke. I feel the same way he does. You know... We've put in a tough year here trying to prove that we can make the grade. Then some upper classman comes up and looks at you and... ...sticks out his hand. And somehow it's like... it's like... Well done, thow good and faithful servant. Yeah. That goes for me too, fellows. Only multiplied by twenty. For twenty years the whole Early family has been waiting for today. Come on, you'd better shake a leg. This is one formation we don't want to miss. About face! Thank you, sir. - Cangratulations, sir. - Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Hello, Doc, hello, Ann. Swell, wasn't it? It won't be long now. Two years in the bottom. - Well, shall we go? - Where are you two going? Class dinner and prayer. In the opening, under the trees. Dinner? Why, it's only six o'clock. You don't know my classmates. Will you be terribly angry if I don't go? Why, I... Please. You won't mind, will you, Dad? No, I won't mind. Do you want to come to class dinner with me, Doc? We're going to have three kinds of ice-cream. Hello, soldier. Hello. How did you get here? - Did not see you in the area. - I followed you. But took a shortcut. How does it feel to be a yearling? I wouldn't know. Well, at least you're making use of the privileges. Usually the first time a new yearling explores a flirtation walk... ...he has company. Not my kind of yearling. Even your kind of yearling should make some concession to tradition. You saw what happened to me at recognition. It hurt. If only one of them had stepped up to me. This silencing business was very funny to begin with. It even amused me at first. Then it got pretty terrible, like something crawling under your skin. I made up my mind I'd show the whole corps they were wrong about me. I worked my head off, played my head off... ...hoping today at recognition they might call it quits, but they didn't. Funny thing is I don't hate them, and I'm not mad at them. They're only giving me what I deserved. Only, it wouldn't have hurt so much if I hadn't been trying. There's an old, old tradition connected with this walk. There seems to be an old, old, tradition connected with everything in this place. They say that if a cadet is refused a kiss under here... ...a rock will fall, and after it the whole mountain. - Fairy tale, I guess. - Oh, I believe in fairy tales. For instance... I wouldn't dare run the risk of wrecking the whole of West Point. Sometimes little girls get awfully mixed up over very important emotions. Ann, one thing I don't need is pity. - Shall we walk? - Shall we? It's the only cup in the world the winner never gets. You see, it all started when the Canadians beat us the first time. They presented us with a cup and we've been trying to give it back to them ever since. This is the year. Sure, football's a great game, but it doesn't prove anything. So you play in a Notre Dame game, so what? We've beaten Notre Dame and everybody else, but we've never beaten a Canadian. I'd rather play on the team that gives the cup back to the Canadians... ...than get a star on my sweater for beating navy. You'll be perfectly safe. When the Red Coats come down here on Saturday... ...you'll be sitting on the bench as usual. Oh, is that so? Well, how do you like this? The coach looked at me twice yesterday. Before the second black eye or after? Oh, wouldn't you be surprised if he called my name out for the varsity? It'd be a misprint. Huh? Aw... This'll be the last practice before the Canadian game. I want you men to polish on your waffling. And remember. Those Red Coats won't be impressed... ...because we've beaten a few teams like Dartmouth, Cornell and Harvard. And I want you forwards to remember this. On the breakaway, the center man is to drop the front row to the blue line... ...and skate one defense man out of position. Come on, take your positions. Come on. Come on, skate! Those Red Coats are tougher than that. Hey, Drew, go out there and show Shannon how to play defense. Huh? I said go in as defense. You said defense, didn't you? - That's what I said. That's all I want to know. Coach sent me to show you how to play defense. I left a nice warm spot for you on the bench. Come on, let's chase those guys off the ice. Sonny! He... he didn't score it, did he? No. Defense, that's me. I'd better get a litter. Is he all right? I hope he's going to be all right. Could we... just see him? - Well, just for a moment. - Thank you, sir. Some guys have all the luck. Imagine, he doesn't have to play against the Canadians. I think he's a goldbrick myself. Ah, what are you guys talking about? It's only Wednesday. Three whole days before Saturday. You suppose I'm gonna stay here while you have all the fun... ...handing back that cup, do you? You just take it easy, son. We'll take care of the cup. Gee, I... I bet Steve skates them dizzy. I don't mind, except that... I just made the team and... It's like running out on the fellows when they need me. Why don't you guys get out of here? You want to miss your chow? Gee, it's gonna be funny having a room all by myself. All right, men, let's go! Show it for them, the RMC. Hit it! Horray-ray-ray! Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah! R-M-C-Team! My name is Strong. My name's Grady. My name is Early. West is my name. Well, the corps gave them a great welcome. They're a great bunch. It gave me an empty feeling inside. The one fellow who would have given them the biggest yell wasn't there. - Ever think what it costs to get in there? - No, why? I have, lots of times. It's the highest admission price in the world. You have to die to get in. I never thought of it like that. To me it's, well, something beautiful. Like parades, and bands playing, and flags flying. I've never been in. Now I'm going in for a reason. Chancellorsville, Antietam, Buena Vista, The names are here, the flags are here. The men are gone. Not gone, Steve. I'm glad I came. I wanted to look at all this. I wanted to make up my mind. I came up here right after recognition. Erected by his classmates. All these plaques and all these pictures were classmates. Fellows like you and me, fellows like... Drew. Maybe next week our class will have a meeting. To toss some dollars into a hat to buy Sonny a nice little plaque for the walls. But it won't mean a thing to Sonny, he won't be here to see it. And the class will go on as before. Mr. and Mrs. Drew will get a letter from the War Department. Dear Sir and Madam, we are returning to you your son, who broke his neck... ...playing hockey for the army on his time. Maybe he won't die. Maybe he'll just lie in bed the rest of his life eating his heart out. And his classmates who didn't break their necks... ...will be graduated from here and scattered to the four corners of the earth. Maybe in time they'll become generals. But Sonny won't. He'll just be a classmate who didn't keep in step. That's his reward for being a true son of the black, gray and gold. That's why I'm getting out of here. - That's why what? - Oh, yes, I'm going to resign. But before I do I wanted to get acquainted with all the Sonnys around the world. I wanted to prove to myself how empty glory can be... ...and what a poor price is paid for that good old army spirit. Sonny didn't ask much of this place. Just to be one of the gang. And neither one of us made it. The one thing that Sonny wanted most was to beat the Canadians. I kept thinking of that all the time we were saying hello to the Canadian team. And then later, when we'd show our Canadians to the rooms to sleep in Sonny's bed, I kept thinking of how he'd waited two years for today. I kept hearing him say, "Defense, that's me." And how he wanted to win this game. I know it may sound silly coming from me. But when I go out to play against those Red Coats, I'm not going to be thinking of the tradition, or the glory, or the excitement. I'm going to be thinking of Sonny Drew. If ever a man on an army team tried to win, I'm going to try. Not for the army, but for Sonny. At least the kid has not much coming to him. When it's over, I'm getting out of here. Things have been pretty tough on you, Steve. Gee, there were times when I didn't see how you could take it... ...and keep coming back for more. A man can take a lot when he wants something badly enough. Hello, Steve. I, um... I often come and look at this place. When there's nobody else around. I, er... I kind of heard what you said. You know, Steve, They tossed me out of here. I felt pretty bad about it. I was a whole lot like you. Support other men in sports, filled up to here with the good old army spirit. And they threw me out because I neglected Euclid for Rodney. It hurt. But I told myself that I didn't care. If the army didn't want me, I didn't want the army. I didn't want any part of the service that could treat me that way. I was wrong. This place does something to you, Steve. It's down inside of you. It's like... well, it's like a kind of an ache in the middle of your chest. And you never get rid of it. I guess that's why I've come back here year after year, watch each class come in and go out. It's made that ache just a little easier. Oh, you'll have it too. No matter where you go or what you do. Because this place gets in your blood. It's part of you, whether you want it to be or not. There's one thing I found out about this place, Steve. No matter how tough the going has been, if you've been honest in your heart, just when you think you can't take any more... something happens. The best of luck, Steve. And the best of luck to you two. Well, er... we, er... We'd better hurry. I'll see you in the dressing room. Yes. Why aren't you inside? I was waiting for you. Is Sonny any better? Nobody knows. I'm glad you're here. After tonight you'll be able to write the end... ...to the personal history of Steve Early at West Point. - The end? - Hm-hmm. This is the last performance of our young hero in an army uniform. I'm getting out. - You mean you're giving up. - That's what I mean. I'm sorry, Steve. I shan't even try to change your mind. - I know how hard you've tried. - Thank you. Do you remember long ago, when I had a birthday? You said that if you ever had to leave here, that... ...you'd let your hair grow in and we'd go back to England? I remember. I'm sure I'd love England. Hey, you'd better hurry. You're late. Don't worry, I won't be late. Not for this game. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We're about to bring to you the 16th annual hockey game... between the Royal Military College of Kingston, Ontario, Canada... ...and the United States corps of cadets of West Point. Tonight, tradition and sportsmanship of the highest type... ...will enfold itself on the glassy surface of perfect ice. These two teams have met fifteen times before tonight. And fifteen times the gentlemen cadets of the Royal Military College... ...have defeated the sons of the Army's black, gray and gold. Fifteen times these two teams have fought each other like wildcats. And during those games, no penalty has ever been called on any man on either side. And that record, ladies and gentlemen, stands alone in the annals of higher sportsmanship. As usual, the corps of cadets is divided into two parts. one of which is yelling for the Royal Military College. Others cheering them on... ...and the teams are assembling for final instructions on the ice. The first Army line, ladies and gentlemen, will begin the game. Oh, wait, wait a minute... I don't see Steve Early. Why, Early, Army's greatest hockey player in years is on the bench. Oh, yeah, trust that Kenny Scott MacDonald, Army's coach, to have one up his sleeve. I believe Mac is going to test that Canadian defense... ...before he sends Early into action. Alright now, Strong n.4, and Taylor n.5, are in position for the face-off. Referee drops the puck and there they go. Strongs passes to captain Muller, races down the ice, but loses it to Ross, the Canadian star. He tosses back to Taylor, who heads toward the Army goal. Strong comes from nowhere and takes the puck from Taylor... ...and is speeding down the ice. They've thrown defense to the winds. Five men are down the ice attacking the Canadian goal. And five forwards means suicide or success. There's a scramble... Taylor 5 takes the puck, He's skating like a madman. It's a breakaway! He's behind the Army forwards, Good trap. He's going down the ice... And he scores! Well, ladies and gentlemen, the score in the first minute of the Army-RMC game... ...is Royal Military College one, Army nothing. And what a match! The Canadian section is cheering them like madmen. I see MacDonald, the Army coach on the bench, with a very worried look. Maybe the Army will change its tactics. Now the referee has the puck. The two centers are facing each other... The referee drops the puck, Strong seizes... He's skating into a pack of Canadians but loses the puck. Perfect pass to Taylor, he's breaking down the ice toward the Army goal... They're going into an Army defense, West makes a beautiful sweep check, comes up with the puck and is away toward the Canadian goal. West passes to Strong. Again Army puts on a power play. All the Army men are down the ice in another desperate attack. They're skating furiously! Strong passes to Bowles, who shoots but misses! There's a match scramble, The Canadians have broken the Army power play. Taylor takes the puck, he breaks away again! He whirls toward the side forward. He comes around Dawn and Shannon. The whole Army team is chasing him. Again there's nobody between them and the Army goal. He breaks to the right... moves the Army goalie out of the cage, he takes a shot, ladies and gentlemen, and it's good! It's good! At this point of the game, it looks like Macdonald's strategy... ...is backfiring on the Army, because he overlooked a truly great RMC star by the name of Taylor, who is the number 5 in this game. Now the Army team is skating back to the center ice... Wait a minute, wait a minute. An Army substitution. - Any instructions, sir? - No instructions, Early. Thank you. It's Drew, Robert Drew. Wait a minute, it couldn't be Drew. Drew's the boy who was hurt in practice. It's Early, Steve Early. He's coming into the game. And he's wearing Drew's number 8 on his jersey. MacDonald, the West Point coach, is playing his ace. Steve Early. The Army attack is now made up with Early at left wing, Strong at center, Miller at right, and now we're just about ready. There's the whistle. The teams take their positions, Referee drops the puck... Strong passes back, Early has it... Here he comes, he turns, it's too much for Taylor. They're skating in fast from the Canadian defense. They're like wild men. Early intercepts the puck and is checked by Taylor, manages to avoid Taylor's puck check, he fakes a pass to Strong, he spins again to avert a Canadian forward... Again he strides the defense with the puck... slides against the goalie and into the cage. And it's a score, ladies and gentlemen. A score for the Army! Say, here's one for the book. The most sensational skating these eyes have seen this season or any other season... ...has apparently been missed by the West Point cheering section. Centers facing each other... referee drops the puck, Taylor takes the puck in the face-off, he backs it to Miller, who returns it to Taylor, Taylor takes a long shot from the blue line! But Johnson clears it nicely and the puck goes to Shannon. The stubborn Canadian forward sweeps an attempt... Oh, what a spill! Boy, oh boy. It's Shannon and Strong now who race down the center ice. Racing past the centers hopelessly behind him, he charges viciously into the Canadian defense, shoots... And it's goal, ladies and gentlemen! Goal! Nice going, Mr. Strong. All right, all set to go once more. Early has the puck. He's finding his way through two Canadian forwards... ...against the sideboards, charging through the whole Canadian team. Goes moves to center, he shifts quickly, fools Miller with the puck. If you can still hear me, ladies and gentlemen, we're in the closing moments of the West Point-Royal Military College hockey game. If West Point is to win, they must win now. Because only seconds remain... and the superior team's strength of the Canadians... will triumph in an overtime period... ...and that cup will again rest in West Point's keeping. The only cup that the losers hold. Taylor has the puck, he's headed for the Army goal, He falls hard in front of the cage. He must be a rubber man. That's the sixteenth time he's been downed tonight. Early again, out of nowhere, he steals the puck! He hurdles the forward attempting a poke check, but Taylor, Taylor seizes the puck from Early. He's charging fast, he passes and slips, falls hard! He trips up from a strong dive and lands like a ton of bricks, ladies and gentlemen. They crash against the sideboard. What action! Action! A wall of human bodies and hockey sticks. West and Smith come together. They tumble and go down. Just thirty seconds left in this game of chills and spills. Both teams have thrown orthodox hockey to the winds. It's a personal duel between Taylor and Early. Taylor is checking Early very closely. They call Early the Duke of West Point. But tonight he's forgotten his spats and umbrella, and he's carrying a stick, a hockey stick. Early breaks away, he spins, passes to Strong. Pretends to pass to Early, he's half-way... ...and his shot is wide. Both teams heap up past the cage... and the Canadian defense fends the Army forward against the sideboard. Fifteen seconds. Fifteen precious seconds remaining in this game. Fifteen seconds, the difference between defeat and victory for either team. Oh, this is glorious, this is insanity! But it's not hockey. Early has the puck, he jumps, he's going past... No, he carries! It's a terrific play. Three men are down on the ice sliding headlong... He dodges the Canadian forward, he leaps a forward, he slips through center, He's swirling into the defense... He shifts, he hits the puck with the force of his body... He's in the net and he scores! It's a score! Hooray! Good boy, Steve! And that was the gong, ladies and gentlemen, ending the most sensational hockey game ever played on this house. And if you don't mind... Here... goes... me... Hi, Jack. This came for you after I left the hospital. I brought it along myself. The mail must go. - Thanks. From home. - Your mother, just after the battle, eh? Yep, twice a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Ready? Uh, no... no, you go ahead. I'll be right out. Alright, I'll wait outside. Strong, I'd like to show you something. This was enclosed. The date and time on that telegram. Why, that's the night he broke limits. - And I reported him. - That's right. He went to town that night to send this money to my mother. That's why I'm here. And when you caught him he told a lie... not to save himself but to save me because he knew I wouldn't have taken the money. Why... for over a year I've been living on Steve's... ...heartache. I'm going to do something about this and right now. I'd consider it a personal favor if you'd let me in on this. Mr. Early, will you follow me, please? Certainly, why not? Front and center, Mr. Early. Remove your right glove, please. Mr. Early, a deliberate oversight on the part of the corps... ...occurred at recognition last year. A man was punished. The corps has discovered that he was punished for the offense... ...of saving the service life of his classmate. I'm glad to know you, Steve. Thank you, sir. Do you mind if I introduce myself? My name is Strong. Nice going, Duke. Dismissed! Well played, Early. Do you feel like seeing visitors? - Oh, who said? - Remember, no excitement. Aw... - Hello, bright eyes. - Hello, Duke. Mr. Drew, may I present Mr. Albright, captain of the Canadian team. Hello. If Mr. Drew had been able to play defense, you never would have scored that goal. Here, Sonny, give them back the cup. You don't mind, do you? It's an honor. Here, I brought this for you to put under your pillow. It scored against Canada. - Aw, gee, Duke, that's... - Now don't get excited, Sonny. Who's getting ex...? How low will I have to drop in the class before I can qualify as a doughboy? I thought diplomacy was your dish. Haven't you heard? The doughboy is the backbone of the service. Oh, that's great, Duke. Now we can all be in the same outfit. My father can fix that easy. - He met a senator once... - Please, Mr. Drew. - Don't get excited. - Who's excited? I'm not excited. Always telling me I'm excited. Everybody tells me I'm excited. I'm excited if I want to get excited. If I am, I want to get excited. Besides, I never get excited. - Is something wrong? - Hm? I've had a quotation running through my head for months. Who is it who said, "You're fresh, conceited, a goldbrick and an army brat"? I think it's a direct quotation from Ann Porter. Oh, yes. Chapter one, volume one of the Personal History of Steven Early, wasn't it? Yes. I hope you're revising the second edition. Yes, yes, I'm eliminating the army brat. Army brat? What else? Well... goldbrick. - And? - Fresh. - Conceited. - That's better. Oh, I brought you something. That's the beginning of volume two... ...of the Personal History of Steve Early at West Point. It'll make such nice reading for us on those long winter nights. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
