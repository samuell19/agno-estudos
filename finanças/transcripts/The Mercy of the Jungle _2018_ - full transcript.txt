THE REAL VICTIM OF THE CONFLICT IS THE CIVIL POPULATION YEAR 1998. SERGEANT XAVIER AND HIS MEN ARE PURSUED AND HIDING AT THE BORDER OF THE JUNGLE. Paul! Hold on. The jungle has beaten me. Now! Paul! Xavier! You have worked a miracle. Our people feel invincible. How old was this kid, Major? Child? With a gun in your hand, you are no longer baby. We both know it. But I killed a child today. He chose the wrong camp. We should not worry. -Stop! Who's there? -It's me! Private Faustin. Thank you. I did not figure out you are a soldier. The peasant woman sold it to me. First mission! Yes! You'll get another one. I'll go to sleep. You'll wake me up when they get up. I will. Please sir. I didn't know Paul, but I'd like to be so brave. Fortunately, you killed his killer. Over... Major Kayitare! Major Kayitare! Over. What are you doing? The cargo's are moving. Attack Kalemi! Fast! Understood, Sir. Get up! Move! Fast! Faustin! Get up! West? I swear it! They didn't wake me up. Please sir! We are lost. Please wait. Xavier! Get up! Drink! You're not a soldier, just a corpse. Congolese! Civilians. Rebels. Whar are you doing sir? Take your uniform off. We will be Congolese refugees. It won't work. Why? They'll see you're a soldier. I look like a peasant master of Muhammad Ali. Let's go through the jungle. The jungle is death. Rebels! Keep going. Xavier! What? Shit! Don't stop! Why? Rebels! We're not going through the village. Good. Let's get out of the way. We can not. We will enter the jungle. To the jungle? The smoke will show us the way. After dark, we'll go down the road. Shut up! Give me the water. There is none. You just drank. No. There is no more water. That's all I drank today. Piss? Did you give me your piss to drink? Are you crazy Fool! Scoundrel! Are we going to Kasai? The major went West. We have to cross half the country. Always West. We have to cross the swamps. Let's go. It will kill you. How can it get so cold? We are in Africa! Elephants walk this way. You'll break your head. And they will trample you. I can handle it. Sleep well with the lions. What? Good night. There are no lions here. Thank you. Thank you very much. See that mountain over there? High. He hides in the clouds... for talking to God. You know how he does? No. He spits fire. You think I'm kidding? The mountain spits fire. I believe you. It won't. My uncle set such traps. At night, the wild boars would eat cassava. You are Rambo. No. An ordinary peasant. We will see. Did I not say iti?! You did it! Bunny! Why does the peasant go to the army? I don't know. Set justice. For genocide. I lost my parents and my brother. Will you do justice? It's a better life. Better than on the farm. The wages are miserable. There are career prospects. I would grow grain in the countryside. He was alive. And was rich. You have a wife? Is pregnant. Will be born when I come back. Young wife. And very beautiful. And you? Do you have a wife? I have to get you home. She died during the first war, when I was in Kinshasa. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. Will you stay in the army? Always been in the army. From child on. I was a refugee. Did you grow up in the camp? You liberated our country. You are a patriot. You deserve a promotion. I will, after returning. Sure. Since we can eat what we will. We will overcome the jungle. Yes, General Faustin. Let's go down the path. No. May lead to the road. Or to the Congolese army camp. West. Always West. Please sir! You're burning up. Has a fever. It had to happen. Let's rest. Let's go! We have to go. Faustin! How did you meet your wife? I grew up with mine in the camp. She was the most beautiful one. I swear I woulld do everything for having her a good life. She was expecting a baby. I told you? They both died in childbirth. When I came back from the first war I understood. God punished me. For all the horrors which I have committed. Please be silent! Now I know it's not over. Still I repent. I will die in this jungle. I can't make it without you. It will. You have to leave quickly, otherwise you will also be judged. ILLEGAL GOLD MINE, SOUTHERN KIWU DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF KONGO. Cargo pants. Which way are we going? There must be a road there. Don't move! Let's go. Stop! We could have succeeded. We could find the way. For sure. Now... they will hunt us. We have to stay in the jungle. Do you remember... when was the last time you saw your father, family? I saw the men and boys taken away from my village. I hid. I didn't understand what was happening. My father was a patriot. He died defending freedom. I was afraid that his death will not be avenged. Are you always scared, Sergeant? Murderers of our families. I trampled the most vulnerable bodies. Women, children, babies. The weak, the starving, the sick. It's hard to say who is the victim and who the executioner. Children will always hate us. The conflict will continue. That's what scares me. Who did it to you? Who? Please stand up! Soldiers! Forward! Together! Please don't die! People. Calm, I will talk with them. We will be Congolese. Good day. Medicines. For malaria. We don't have it. I'm with the Congolese army. I need medication. We have already given everything away. Get off! You think I'm kidding? We don't have drugs. We come back from Kasai. From shopping. We are farmers. Kasai? It is far? Two weeks on the bike. You'll take us. We have to go back! That's an order! You must kill us! I'll kill him. Please sir! Help me. Come on! Help! Sergeant! Please drink it. How long? Two days. It's good that you are awake. The boss is sick of us. Please drink. EASTERN KASAI VILLAGE, THE CENTRAL DEMOCRATIC PART THE REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO Where are we? In a village on the Lomami. Over the Lomami? Where's your uniform? We are Congolese. Of course. Yhere hasn't been here for months Congolese soldiers. Yes? We lost a battalion. When the soldiers were here, they left wrestling. And the militias burned the fields. Hutu cargo pants? Hutu, Tutsi. What's the difference? They want to kill themselves here. Have you seen the Rwandan army? I can see that whatever happens, the ordinary people always suffer. What do you say? Soldiers consider themselves strong. I think they are lazy. They couldn't last the day in the field. I grew up in the field. A peasant? That's what they call me. You don't. We can do something for you. I'll help you get back into the army, but you have to say that we have received you well. That we support the Congolese army in the fight against invaders. Leave us our harvest and save your daughters from nightmares of war. Of course. I will inform my superiors about your loyalty. Thank you very much. When you rest, we'll take it you to the branch. Apparently he is fighting with the Rwandans. With a government army? The cab is crowded, but the president formed a coalition. They fought for two months on that top because of diamonds. We'll leave in the morning. Well. We appreciate what you have done for us. How can we repay you? Take a bath. We made it. General Faustin! You saved my life. Thank you. This is the Congolese side, Angolans and Zimbabweans. On the other, Rwandans. Thank you. Good luck. Moment. Amine! RWANDY MILITARY CAMP. CABIN. EXCLAVE TO THE CONGO. I don't see the flag. Will they shoot us? We're deserters. No. Let's go. For sure? Got a better idea? For sure? Do you want to play a soldier again? Too late to think about it. Kibindankoyi. What? Kibindankoyi. He was with us. What? You do not remember? I'll get him. No! Yes! Xavier! Kibindankoyi! It's Xavier! We are Rwandans. Who's there? Don't shoot! In the east they rape ours wives. They're stealing gold! You did well, Major. But a soldier accompanied me. We have a hospital in Cabinda. Please send Faustin away. If he dies, shoot me too. You must be tough. This is. What he did? They say he killed a lion. Lieutenant! How was your night? The monkeys are fucking. Dad!
