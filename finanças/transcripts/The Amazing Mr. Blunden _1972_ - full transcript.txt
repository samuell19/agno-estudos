FISHMONGER: Lovely fresh fish! lovely bit of fresh fish, sir. Nice and fresh. You'll love it. Here you are, governor. Lovely fish. Lovely mackerel, caught fresh this morning. Lovely fish, all fresh. Fresh mackerel (SINGING) Wall flower, wall flower, climbing up so high. All the little children, they are born to die, except our Mary Campbell. She can dance. She can sing. She can wear a wedding ring. (SINGING) Wall flower, wall flower, climbing up so high. All the little children, they are born to die, except our Mary Campbell-- Yes? Yes, can I help you? Mrs. Allen? Mrs. Richard Allen? Yes, that's right. I represent a firm of solicitors, madam. The firm of Blunden, Blunden, Claverton and, uh-- - I suppose it's about the rent. - Oh, no. Indeed no, madam. I am no debt collector, I am a partner in the firm of Blunden, Blunden, Claverton, and-- What on earth is that young man's name? Well, no matter now. The important thing is that the news I bring will, I am sure, prove entirely welcome to you. At least, I trust it will prove entirely welcome to you, Mrs.-- Allen? Well, you'd better come in, then, out of the cold. Oh, thank you. Stand up, children. We have a visitor. Do continue, my dears. Is it is I who must apologize for disturbing your meal. Do sit down. Perhaps you'd like a cup of tea? Oh, the chair I accept with gratitude, madam, but the tea, I'm afraid, I must decline. But I'll come straight to the purpose of my visit. Mrs. Allen, I trust you'll not be offended, but I'm in a position to offer you a job, or rather, a reasonable salaried occupation. Why should I be offended? My firm is seeking a reliable person to act as a caretaker to a property which is in our charge, and so far, we have been-- well, we've had some difficulty in finding anyone willing to take the post. Difficulty? Why difficulty? It's remoteness, you understand? It's a fine house, pleasantly situated, but it stands alone in some way from the nearest village. A little woman comes out to do what cleaning is necessary. There's a rent free caretaker's cottage attached to the house, and your duties will be very light. For the children's' sake, what do you say? It is awful, isn't it? But it's the best that I could find. So little money, so many debts. A widow's pension is all that I have. Well? Shh. Excuse me. He's had a cold. I think he must have earache. I-- I'll get some warm oil. Don't cry. Shh. - Shall I help, mother? - No, it's all right. Thank you, dear. Just look after our guest. Are you-- Are you sure you wouldn't like a cup of tea? No, thank you, Lucy. But now that we are alone, I wonder-- I wonder if I might ask you both a question. I hesitate because it's rather an unusual question, and I want you to consider it seriously. Of course, sir. Fire away. Yes, fire away. Do you think you be afraid if you saw a ghost? I-- I think, quite honestly, sir, I should be a little bit scared. I think it would depend on what sort of ghost it was, sir. I mean, if it's just wandering around in a white sheet moaning a bit, well, it would be all right, wouldn't it? But if it was one of these skeletons with no head and a nasty grin, well, that's different, isn't it? You can't grin if you've got no head, stupid. Exactly. Anyway, I have very good reason to believe there are no such visions. No, these ghosts would appear to you, well, very much like ordinary people. Children, perhaps. Children of your own age, or even an old man such as myself. We wouldn't be afraid of a ghost like that, would we, Lucy? I mean, well, you wouldn't know they were ghosts, would you? Unless, of course, you could see through them. I mean, right through them. And even that wouldn't be very scary if their heads were in the right place. Sometimes ghosts are people who come back seeking help. We would help if we could. Wouldn't we, Jamie? I believe you understand, little lady. Children do sometimes. But as they grow older, they lose their power to believe in the unlikely. When you come to the house, you'll hear all sorts of strange tales from the people who live in it. They'll tell you it's haunted. But you mustn't be afraid, because when the time comes, you'll know what to do. We shan't be afraid. We'll do what we can. Thank you, Lucy. James, thank you. Well, I must not stay. I've been here too long. - Shall I fetch mother? - No. No time, no time. But ask her to call at my chambers tomorrow. The chambers. Where is it? What a sensible lad. Will it be there? I mean, do you know it? Is this right? Will it be there? This address, it looks a bit old. It will be there. CHILD: Happy Christmas! What? Oh, yes! A happy Christmas! Tomorrow, then. Tell them I sent you. Claverton will be there, or young, uh-- oh, what is his blasted name? A happy-- a very happy Christmas! (TOGETHER) Happy Christmas! Who was he, anyway? He didn't say, did he? Yes, ma'am? Can I be of service? I've come about the job. A caretaker, I was told. You've come about a job? I understand you're looking for a caretaker for a rather remote country house. The job has not yet been advertised madam. How did you come to hear about it? An old gentleman came to see me. Jamie, do you have the card? I Expect it was Mr. Blunden, that being the first name on the card. He informed me of the vacancy and advised me to call on you. I see. You must forgive me, madam. Mr. Blunden has not been at the office recently, and I did not realize he had taken a hand in the matter. If you will please let me have your name, I will, um, inform Mr. Claverton that you are here. Yes. Oh! Allen, Mrs. Allen. And, uh, my children. This is Lucy. Lucy. James. Oh, and this is Benjamin. Thank you, Mrs. Allen. Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Claverton-- Well, that's odd. That's very odd. Very odd, indeed. Please, Mrs. Allen. Mr. Claverton will see you now. Thank you. Good morning. You may sit down if you wish. Jamie, look. It's Mr. Blunden. So it is. You are looking at Mr. Blunden's portrait? Yes, he's the one who came to see us. I'm afraid I've got you out there, sonny Jim. The portrait is, in fact, of Mr. Blunden's great grandfather who died about 100 years ago, and I doubt if our Mr. Blunden came to see you. He's bedridden. Should be in a home, he should. Oh, dear lady, I must say how delighted I am to have a responsible person like yourself in charge. I shall write and confirm our arrangements. Arnold? And I feel quite certain that you'll have no trouble from that, uh, little matter we talked about. A mere country superstition, nothing more. Are you Smith? I beg your pardon. Are you Smith? You know, on the card. Blunden, Claverton, and Smith. No, sonny Jim, I am Mr. Clutterbuck. - You should be glad. - Why? No one could forget a name like that. It is a silly name. I'm sorry, sir. Cheerio then, Herbert. Cheerio, Dick. Any more want to get on, then? Just us now, Herbert. The big house, please. Langley Park. Langley Park? Langley Park. Your key, madam. LUCY: Please let us be happy here. Bless mommy and Jamie, Benji and darling daddy. Amen. And don't let there be any ghosts. JAMIE: Oh, shut up, Luce. Poor . How sad. BOY'S VOICE: Sara? BOY'S VOICE: Sara? Sara? Sara? Sara? GIRL'S VOICE: I know where you are, Georgie. I'll find you. Wait for me, Georgie! Wait! Oh, Georgie, please wait. BOY'S VOICE: It's Bella. Hide! Hide, Sara! Sara, hide! But I did hear voices. Honestly, I did. My dear girl, all big houses have voices if they're alone for a long while. Everyone knows that. You're just trying to be clever. Good night, James. James! James! Come here! Look! Just-- James! what's the matter? Well, I think I've seen-- what is-- oh, James, you know! Ghosts? James, two! Two! Blooming . LUCY: Jamie-- Lucy-- Lucy-- At last. We have someone with a little good sense. I-- I beg your pardon. You didn't run away screaming. You didn't run away. Well, I did. At first I did. I'm sorry, but in the mist I thought you were ghosts. They do say the house is haunted, you know. Yes we did know. I suppose if we say that we are ghosts, you will run away. Mr. Blunden said children of our own age. You are ghosts. SARA: Georgie, I do believe we have found help. JAMIE: Tell us. Tell us how we can help. I mean, who are you? LUCY: Yes, tell us from the very beginning. JAMIE: Start with "once upon a time." All the best stories start with that. James! SARA: All right. Once upon a time, we lived very happily here. But in the spring of the year 1818, our mother and father were tragically killed when their carriage overturned coming back from London one night. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he be dead, yet shall he live-- SARA (VOICEOVER): Uncle Bertie, who was our father's half brother, became our guardian, and Mr. Blunden, the family solicitor, became our other guardian. Do stop sniveling in front of the servants. It'll do no good. SARA (VOICEOVER): After the funeral, Uncle Burt lived in London. He took an unusual interest in the ballet and fell in love with a ballerina. (SINGING) I'm a naughty girl. And I'm a naughty boy. It takes a naughty girl to make a naughty boy. put them all together and a naughty . SARA (VOICEOVER): Her name is Arabella, and she's very pretty. Uncle Bertie thinks so, too, but in her mind she's only a child. SARA (VOICEOVER): He often returned home to Langley Park to supplement his income from a private source. SARA (VOICEOVER): And so Arabella and Uncle Bertie were engaged. That evening, they went to ask Bella's parents for their consent to marry. SARA (VOICEOVER): Mr. and Mrs. Wickens were the proprietors of a select hotel. Mama! This is Bertie what I told you about. We're engaged! Look! Oh! Wickens! Come and meet this here tough! It's our little Bella's intended! Wickens! SARA (VOICEOVER): Uncle Bertie and Bella were married. Now where's she going for her honeymoon? Like she says, Paris, Rome? I mean, even if it's only the Isle of Wight, for God's sake, put her out of her misery! It may well be the Isle of Wight, dear mother-in-law. The Isle of Wight! God's truth! Steady, dearest. The truth is that financially I am hopelessly embarrassed. Hopelessly. I haven't said so as I had no wish to spoil our wedding day. Well, you're having a darn good try, Albert. You mean you're-- you're short of the ready? Is that it? Well, blow me! What an empty bottle of gin you are! Who's got it all, then? Who's got it? Master Georgie is the only member of the family with money. 30,000 pounds, to be exact, left to him by his father, William. Would have been mine, of course, but being only a half brother, Georgie gets it. 30,000 nicker? Left to him in trust, mother-in-law, until he's 21. Can't be touched. It's Georgie's and his alone. Unless he dies, of course, but heaven forbid the thought. But he's only 10. He's got years to go. My Bells will have gone to seed in 11 years. I'm not going to have her living in this dirty, great mansion in poverty, slowly going to seed. Dear mother-in-law, I will find a way. I assure you. My Bella will not suffer, I promise. Oh, she will not. You are quite correct there, Albert. My little rose, my nightingale. That Georgie's got a lot to answer for, being only 10 and all that money going to waste. He's got a lot to answer for. I shall commence my economies by sacking as many of the surplus staff in this house as I can. We shall have our honeymoon, my dearest Bella. Oh, make it soon, Bertie dearest. Make it soon. Did it, there. Now you. SARA (VOICEOVER) : Most of the stuff were sacked, and Mrs. Wickens took over the housekeeping. And good riddance to the lot of you! Sara! Georgie! Are you trying to get me in the hot with your uncle, are you? Get in here before you catch your death of cold! Well, don't dawdle. Run! Catch their death of cold. Meakin! You served the master and mistress, have you? (FRIGHTENED) Yes. "Yes, Mrs. Wickens!" Yes, Mrs. Wickens. Now you take those scraps to the children and make sure they're in bed. Yes, Mrs. Wickens. Shall I leave the windows open like you said? Only it is very cold tonight. Leave 'em open. It's good for them! Too much comfort's bad for children. Too many blankets is bad for them. Now, you make sure they haven't put no extra blankets. It's bad for them! Yes. "Yes, Mrs. Wickens!" Yes, Mrs. Wickens! You skinny slut! Now, my love. How's that consomme coming along? There, Miss Sarah. That will keep you warm. It's a pair of warming newspapers. - Quick, Tom! It's Meakin! Right, then. Good night, miss. Good night, Master Georgie. Good night, Tom. That's a wonder, you being in bed. Here's your supper. Good night. And leave that window open. Mrs. Wickens' orders. Good night, then. SARA: Good night, Tom. SARA (VOICEOVER) : For a long time, we endured hard beds, scraps, and bread and water. We did not truly think ourselves in danger. Then one night. MRS. WICKENS: Time's a wasting away! It's taking too long, Mr. Wickens. They're getting fatter, not thinner. Fatter, Wickens! Do you hear me, you ugly lump? Because I'm talking to you. Wickens! Do you hear me? Uh. Good! Because I'm talking to you. They didn't get no colds. Why? Why! There was a bloomin' hurricane blowing through here the other night. They should be wasting away with a cold in their bones. Aren't you interested in cash, you great lump? Cash! 30,000 pounds if he snuffs it. It'll be all our darlin' little Bella's if that Georgie snuffs it. Her as well, that stuck up Sara. Here as well. They mean us, Georgie. What's "snuff it," Sara? Do they mean to kill us, Sara? MRS. WICKENS: An accident must befall them. Can't wait forever. An accident. A quick accident , my love, and you are gonna help me. Are you listening? Uh. Uncle Bertie. We must tell him at once! Come on! BERTIE: Lovely, my little precious buttercup. Uncle Bertie! Oh, please, Uncle Bertie! BERTIE: Get out of here. What do you think you're doing? - Uncle Bertie! Get out of here, both of you! You should be in bed. Wandering about at this time of night! Are we to have no privacy? But we're to be murdered! You certainly are. By me, unless you go at once. Shall I take a strap to you? But we are! Oh, please listen. Mrs. Wickens says that we are too fat, that we should be cold, and that an accident should snuff us. Bed, Sara. It's true, it's true! It is! Bed, both of you. I'm not in the mood for drama tonight. Your Auntie Bella has been entertaining me with classical moments from history, and you bring me low drama. Be off with you at once. Bella, send them out, my love. Yes, Bertie, my love. How dare you talk like that about my ma and pa! Bed! Please, Uncle. For the last time, Sara. Murders, indeed. Imaginations, overactive imaginations. Say your prayers, and ask God to forgive you. Sara? Yes? Perhaps we did imagine. We didn't, Georgie. I'm very much afraid we didn't. Langley Park. Buckinghamshire. Yes, I've put that. April the 16th, 1818. "Dear Mr. Blunden, you are our only chance. The Wickens are bent on destroying us. Please, please help. Uncle Bertie won't listen. He says it's all imagination, but it's not. We shall run away if you don't help. The danger is very great for us." Yours-- --Sara. And me. Come along, come along, come along. "Stupid and childish complaints." "About your harsh treatment." "And threaten to run away." "They must not run away, Mrs. Wickens. Lock them up." Sara. library? What does it mean, Georgie? What on earth is it? GEORGIE: Come on. Come on where? The library, of course, silly. Meakin didn't lock the door. Come on. Where, Georgie? I mean, what are we looking for? Don't ask me. Just look, as it said. GEORGIE: Why has the library changed, Sara? Has it been magic, Sara? SARA: Shh, Georgie. Shh. A charm to move the wheel of time. A charm. It's pleased, Georgie. The library is pleased. Bring and brew the following herbs together. Balm, hyssop, bloodwort-- Yech. SARA (VOICEOVER) : Musk, toadflax. GEORGIE (VOICEOVER): Toadflax? SARA: Yes. pennywhistle, ,, and drink the liquid. It will separate your minds completely from the time you are in. Do you understand that, Georgie? A bit. Perhaps this is our chance, Georgie. Look. To make the mind still, to escape from time. There, Georgie! To escape. Someone is trying to tell us how to escape. Not to another place, but to another time. Oh, Georgie! It might be poisonous, Georgie. I thought of that. I'll put it in Mrs. Wickens' drink to see if she'll die or not. Suppose she does die. Good if she does. That'll be murder. I'm not giving it her because I think it is poison. I'm only making sure it isn't. Why are you pulling a funny face? It's either Mrs. Wickens or her cat, and that cat never did anyone any harm. Breakfast, you brats! Oh! Sara? Yes? It wasn't poison. Go with you? You mean back to your time? Well, how can we? I'll help you find the herbs. You can brew the potion as we did. After that, it depends upon whether your will is great enough to help. Well, it is. You don't we'd just stand around and let that awful old woman do you in? Snuff us. - Snuff you. - Sara? We'll help you, Sara. Sara? I don't feel well. Sara? Don't be afraid, darling. When you get back, I shall be there. Sara. Sara. Sara. It's because he's so young. He often returns before me. It's all right. We always arrive back together. We must hurry. Georgie is a warning to us that I may soon follow him. Now please don't forget, put five leaves of each into a bowl and pour on hot water. Keep it warm for now, and strain it off through a muslin cloth. Bring the potion, and meet me here at sunset tomorrow. Promise you'll not fail us, Jamie! Promise! Promise! Please promise! I promise! I promise, Sara! Lucy, I just had a brilliant idea. What? All we have to do is hunt in the churchyard. Why? Well, Lucy, sometimes you really are dim. If none of the gravestones has Sara and Georgie's names on, then we shall know they didn't die. Don't you see? We shall know in advance that we've saved them. Oh, I see. We can go off into the past knowing everything will be all right. Yes, I told you it was a brilliant idea. MAN: Shh! Quiet, you children. LUCY: I don't like it, Jamie. Not one bit. It's just not nice. I'm not going to look. JAMIE: Don't, then. William-- no. Sara Catherine Latimer. Lucy! Lucy, come here! Sara Catherine Latimer. George Richard Latimer. Died April the 21st, 1818. That's tomorrow, Lucy. Tomorrow, only 100 years ago. Make sure that top's on tight, Lucy. We don't want to go through making it all again. We haven't got time, anyway. We're late as it is. Come on. JAMIE: Sara! LUCY: Sara! SARA : I thought you'd changed your minds. Where's Georgie? He had a slight disagreement with Mrs. Wickens. She's locked him in the cellar. Tom is guarding him for me while I'm away. We can't be long as I only drank a little of the potion. Sara before anything else, we must tell you that-- James! Tell me, James. Whatever it is, tell me. Well, it was in the graveyard. I know about the grave. I've never told Georgie. But I know. But the date, Sara. It was 100 years ago tomorrow. BLUNDEN: That's true. Blunden, remember? Camden Town? - Hello! Oh, yes! We haven't much time, my dears. Excuse me, sir, but you were dead, too. Part of me, Jame, my boy. A part only. I am the dead part of Blunden. The other part of me was that Blunden who wouldn't listen to the pleas of Sara and Georgie, the Blunden who failed them. I have suffered for 100 years, tormented by my own conscience. Seems more like 1,000 years. But now I've been given the chance to put right the wrong, the terrible wrong, I have done and to bring my punishment to an end. But first I have to find someone to trust me, to trust me once again, to trust me even with his life. Lastly, I must go back to undo the harm I've caused. Mr. Blunden, sir, I'm the one who has to trust you, aren't I? I mean, that's why you brought us here to Langley Park, why you came to Camden Town. Yes. It's not an easy thing, I know, James, but all will be revealed, my dears. Tell me what to do. That is not yet clear, my boy. But whatever it may be, nothing shall harm you. I promise that I shall guard you from all dangers however they may come. I know I'm not worthy, but it's our only hope. Sara's, George's, and mine. Thank you. Lucy, you must trust him, too. I'll try. I really will. Thank you. It's time to go. Go on. Jamie-- Go on. A bit more. LUCY (VOICEOVER): James. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. JAMIE (VOICEOVER): Lucy, it's working. It's working. SARA (VOICEOVER): It's time to go. BLUNDEN (VOICEOVER) : Whatever it may be, nothing shall harm you. JAMIE (VOICEOVER): There's Georgie. The sexton said it was a fire. SARA (VOICEOVER): Promise you'll not fail us, Jamie! Promise! GEORGIE (VOICEOVER): Go with you back to your time. TOM: I see by the way you're dressed-- I see by the way you're dressed-- I see by the way you're dressed that you don't come from hereabouts. I suppose you wouldn't have come from the new world, would you? - New world? - Aye, America. It's the new world. Yes, I suppose you could say we have come from the new world. They say it's a wonderful place. Uh, yes, it is. Course, it is a terrible long journey, but it is one I plan to make meself one of these days when I'm older like. Oh, Miss Sara's been teaching me to read and write. I mean to go there and try my fortune. They say there's a fine future in America for a young man that can read and write, and ain't afraid of a bit of hard work. Yes, Tom, yes. Now, how is my brother? Oh, yes. He's safe, but he's growing hungry. He told me. MRS. WICKENS: Sara! Sara! Sara? Sara! Sara? Where are you, you hussy? Kissing and cuddling with that garden boy, no doubt. I know your game. Oh, let me stay here and fight here, please! I'm not afraid of her! You know I'd die for you, Miss Sara. Yes, Tom, I know. Now go quickly for my sake. Please! All right. We don't go with him? We don't want her to know we're here. No, stay in the shadows. Sara! Sara! So there you are. And all alone, I see. Who was here with you a moment ago? One of them vulgar servants, I'll be bound. Not only have you got no sense, miss. You got no taste, neither. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Wickens. I only came out to speak a word to poor Georgie in the cellar. You came out to speak to him the cellar? Where is the cellar, miss? Where is it? It's under the kitchen, Mrs. Wickens. "Oh, it's under the kitchen, Mrs. Wickens." Then what you doing in the stable? The cellar ain't under the stable, now, is it? No, Mrs. Wickens. "No, Mrs. Wickens." I was going to talk to him through the grating. Oh, was you? Well, it'll be boarded up in the morning. Oh, please let him out, Mrs. Wickens! He's only a little boy. It's so dark in there for him. Don't talk to me about that brat! After what he said to me, he'll be lucky to be out 'afore Christmas! Next year! - Oh, please! - Shove off! Me arm's gone mad! Get-- get back! Back! What's that? It was me, and I'll do it again if you touch Sara! You got persons aiding and abetting you, have you? I tell you, it was me! James! I got to walk off that red .. Last month it was Chinamen coming out the ,, and now it's invisible beings trying to grab my body. Are we ghosts? Did it work? - Yes! - But Tom could see us. Why can't she? Too old, too insensitive. Who is? Who's too bloomin' old? miss! Come on ! But Georgie! He stays where he is. James. What? She didn't see us. Mrs. Wickens didn't see us. We're ghosts. We really are. Bloomin' . SARA: Please let go, Mrs. Wickens! You're hurting me! MRS. WICKENS: I will hurt you! I'll hurt you if I have my way! Children Meakin? Meakin! - Yes? Yes, Mrs. Wickens! Yes, Mrs. Wickens. Take Miss Sara up to her bedroom and lock her in. MEAKIN: Yes. Yes, Mrs. Wickens! Yes, Mrs. Wickens! BELLA: Mama! Mama! Mama! See my new, pink silk. Oh, Bella! You look a picture. Do us a turn around, my thrush, my linnet, and let your old ma see you. Oh, Bella, you look a picture. Just you wait till that Bertie casts his eyes on you . Ain't it pretty, Sarah Sue? (SINGING) Ain't it pretty, Sarah Sue? Would it look the same on you? Ain't it pretty? Very pretty, Bella. Yes, it is. Thank you. JAMIE: I think she looks like a stuffed pink pig. Bella! She can't see us, can she? She's only got the mind of a child. I think perhaps she can. BELLA: Oh, momma! Ghosts! I swear, momma dear, I can see right through 'em! Right through 'em! MRS. WICKENS: Hush now, Bella. There ain't nobody there. Here. Let me smell your breath. You haven't been in my gin, have you? They're there. There. (SCARY VOICE) Fear me, Bella. I shall haunt you until you release little Georgie from the cellar. Let Georgie out of the cellar, ma. And then perhaps they'll leave me alone. Leave you alone, love? There's nobody there. There is, ma! (SCARY VOICE) Let Georgie go. Don't overdo it. What on earth is going on? What is occurring? I heard screaming! Bella! Bella? Oh, Bertie! Bella. I was that scared. Tell ma to let him out of the cellar or they'll be after me again. Let who out? Who is after you? What on earth is going on here? Mrs. Wickens! Master Georgie was very rude, sir. Bertie, dear. Very rude. I-- I put him in the cellar to cool his blood off, sir. Bertie, dear. Release him at once. I will not have Bella distressed. Meakin, fetch some smelling salts. Yes, sir. Why are you waiting? Son-in-law, my dear, how can I leave my baby like this? My wife, mother-in-law, is perfectly all right with me. I demand that you do as I say. Oh! If you shout, I'll have a heart attack. I will! I'll have heart failure! Oh! Oh! I think I'm having it! I'm off! Oh! You are off, Mrs. Wickens. Get up. Your performance this evening is not convincing. Get up, I say, and release Georgie instantly. Go with her, Sara. Now, my little sausage. Who is after you? We are. Oh, my God. What is all the noise downstairs? They're having dinner. Why don't we eavesdrop? We might find out what they're up to. Georgie, if you're going to come with us, you'll have to be quiet. Promise? Promise. Good. And the vicar JAMIE: They're finishing. There's Mr. Blunden. It's all falling into shape. Time is running out. I can't bear to think of it. nightingale .. No. It'll only be for a day or two, my pet, and Mr. Blunden thinks it advisable that I go with him to London. I'm sorry, Mistress Arabella. Mr. Blunden doesn't know how sorry he's going to be. Now, Georgie, what should we do ?? --and it'll save a great deal of time. And I must get some money, my sausage, or there'll be no more silk dresses for you. Mr. Blunden! Oh, sir! You must listen to us! What do you think you're doing? SARA: Uncle Bertie won't heed us! GEORGIE: He doesn't care if we snuff it. Listen to her. How dare you! You are two mischievous children. Your uncle is a very kind and considerate guardian, and you should be more careful. SARA: But Mrs. Wickens, she means to harm us, Mr. Blunden. She does! I know she does! Don't leave us here along with her. (WHISPERING) Please listen to her. Bertie dear, surely they cannot mean to accuse dear mama? No, of course not, my dearest. Your mother is a splendid woman, kind and considerate at all times. Quite unique. Your mother is a drunken old witch, Bella! I can't bear it, Jamie. I just can't bear it. I'll go. If Mr. Blunden sees me, he might remember what's going to happen. LUCY: It hasn't happened, so how can he remember it? He must remember something. He brought us here. There are two of you. Two Mr. Blundens. Yes, James, my boy. There are two of us, though we're both the same man. But he wouldn't know. It Was I who brought you here. What if I told him? He wouldn't see or hear you. He's a shallow, insensitive man. It's very difficult, Mr. Blunden. We came to help you, but there's so little we can do. It's not yet the time. Everything must go on as before. For a while, anyway, just as before. Now you must just wait and be patient. Wait and be patient. Wait and be patient. BERTIE: I will return as soon as I've raised enough money to keep us happy. my dearest sausage. Shall we go, Blunden? Au revior, my daughter of a unique mother. Now, Luce! Sara! Sara! Sara! Georgie! We must find them. I'm sure the time is now. Blunden leaving and Sara outside the house. It'll be soon, Lucy. I know it. Perhaps Mrs. Wickens changed her mind, didn't put them in the cellar. Perhaps they're in the nursery. Quick, we'd better get out of sight. She can't see us. Bella can. (SINGING) I'm a naughty girl, and you're a naughty boy-- BELLA: Now I'm doing this secretly out of the kindness of me heart. Hurry up and drink it or ma will catch you. SARA: That's very kind of you, Bella. LUCY: Get the key. No. if we take it now, she'll tell her mother it's missing. We'll have to get to without anyone noticing. Follow her when she comes out and see that she does with it. Good night. (SINGING) I'm a naughty girl, and you're a naughty boy. It takes a naughty girl to make a naughty boy-- --put them all together and they make a naughty day. Did they drink it all? Yes, ma. You didn't say as I sent it, did you? ma! Yes, I told them like you said. Which was? I was doing it out of the kindness of me heart, and that I wanted them to get a good night's sleep. Oh, they'll sleep, all right. There's my good little girl. Don't want them to think as I'm getting soft, now, do I? Now I want you to take this tray to the kitchen and wash their mugs where very hard. Very hard. Don't want no sediment. Wash 'em in boiling water. Yes, mum. Do something, quick! Outside. I'll get into a room. We've got to get that key! Come on! MRS. WICKENS: Oh, God! What a . JAMIE: No! Mr. Wickens! Bundles of wood, bundles of wood. Lucy, the fire! He started it! LUCY: Oh, no! Come on! Listen, we'll have to separate. I'll get and axe and break down the nursery door, but you must stay here and warn Tom. His life depends on it, Luce! All right. LUCY: Sara! Georgie! - Miss Sara! - Sara! Is she all right, missus? Is she safe then? They're still in the nursery. James is trying to break down the door. Tom, you mustn't! You'll fall! Tom, it isn't safe. Really, it isn't. You're going to be killed. I know you will. I will be killed, but a person I will gladly die for. You'll make things worse! MR. WICKENS: Ohh! LUCY: GEORGIE: Sara! Sara, are you all right? Sara? Sara? Please, don't be dead. Sara, wake up! Doctor, open the window, for pity's sake! Sara! Sara! Open the window! LUCY: No! Don't! I'm with them, Lucy! I'm here! Where's Sara? Is she all right? They're alive but I can't wake them up, Tom. They've been drugged. Come on, Sara. MR. WICKENS: Uhhh! Uhhh! I'm going to kill you! I will! Uhh! I mean it! Uhhh! BELLA: (SINGING) I'm a naughty girl-- Missus, this is no time for singing. MRS. WICKENS: Wickens! You've gone too far! Oh, Miss Arabella, please! (SINGING) Wickens! Oh, James! I thought you'd never come! I've got to go back! Look after Sara! Come on. Sara? Is he all right? - He's alive. - Where's Georgie? Is he still up there? Tom? Lucy-- I would, by god. I would, Georgie! I would. James. We will go together. The file will not touch you. Now is the time. Look straight ahead and don't be afraid. I can't feel a thing. Nothing. Look straight ahead. Tom, where's Georgie? Sara? Sara? MR. BLUNDEN (VOICEOVER): At last. At last. Thank you, my dears. Jamie! Georgie! Mr. Blunden, you promised to guard them! You promised! Jamie! Lucy! Georgie! Georgie! Oh, Georgie! Georgie, oh! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie? You're too late, Mr. Blunden! You're always too late! I won't go back without Jamie! I will not go without Jamie! I won't go without him! I won't go without him, do you hear? I won't go without Jamie! Jamie! I won't go without Jamie! I won't go! Jamie! I won't go without Jamie! --back without Jamie. Jamie-- Jamie? Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie? Jamie! Jamie! Jamie? Jamie? Jamie! Jamie! Jamie? Jamie! LUCY (VOICEOVER): Supposing Sara's and Georgie's graves have gone. I can't be as silly as that. I can't really go wandering around expecting to find a yawning hole surrounded by a crowd of astonished villagers. (TOGETHER) Ohhh! LUCY (VOICEOVER): And yet if it is all the same, what does it mean? Did we dream it? Where is James, then? "The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep." "Frederick Percival Blunden gave his life to save the children in his care." April the 21st, 1818. Yesterday. A hundred years ago. We did it. Jamie did it. Lucy! He's awake! Jamie's awake! And then he suddenly woke up, and of all things, he wanted something to eat. But I think he was a bit confused because he said, sorry, I got held up, as if he'd been on a journey or something. Can I go up and see him? Yes, of course you can, darling. Mommy, I do love you. Are you all right? Well, of course. Are you? Where have you been, then? Been? Yes, been, James. Where have you been? You know very well. Where have we been? You remember, then? Well, do you? Lucy, did we? Did we? Yes, Jamie. I went to the churchyard, and the children's graves have gone. We did it, Jamie! You did it! You helped. A bit. JAMIE: Clutterbuck. Trouble. Camden Town, here we come. It's all right, darlings. I've had a letter, and it's private. Cheerio, swans. Where have you been hiding? Has he finished yet? In the attic. No, I don't think so. You know that blue vase? Yes. Remember I nearly smashed it when you were trying to get the keys from Mrs. Wickns? Only I couldn't do it. Strange to think of it being here all this time. Probably here before Sara and Georgie. It'll probably be here long after we've left. Probably. Doesn't really seem fair. MRS. ALLEN: James! Lucy! Come on. What does he want? I don't know. He looks pretty nervous, as usual. Mr. Clutterbuck, you know James and Lucy. Hello, again. Well? When do we go? Go? Yes, go. Back to Camden Town. When? We don't have to go, Jamie. Briefly, our Mr. Blunden, for some unknown reason, raised himself from his bed of mental misery, hurled himself as best he could last Thursday-- 4:30, it was-- into the office and said, "Get them papers on the marriage of Miss Sara and Master Tom." So I did as I was told, him being the governor, balmy or not, and here they are. It seems that we're related to these people. They were great grandparents of daddy's. Just over 100 years ago, they lived here, and then they went to America. Not over 100 years ago. Exactly 100 years ago, Mrs. Allen. New York, America, 1825. Sara Latimer of Langley Park married a Thomas Mortimer, a gardener by trade. Out of his class he was. Mr. Clutterbuck has come to tell us that we are the legal owners not only of the cottage, but of the house itself. We can stay. Plus an allowance of 500 pounds a year to keep us in comfort. In perpetuity. In what? For your lifetime, sonny Jim. I won't go into all the legal logistics. You wouldn't understand. Step this way if you please. All will be revealed. Sara. Tom. I know. Great grandma Sara. Great grandpa Tom. LUCY: Mr. Blunden. Mr. Blunden. Mr. Blunden. Which one? Which one? (TOGETHER) It's ours! It's ours, Benji. It's really ours. JAMIE: It's ours! LUCY: It's ours! JAMIE: It's ours!
