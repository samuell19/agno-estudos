No, this. Us. Doing a stakeout? Like we don't know we're being sidelined. - You know what, don't blame me. You're the one who flapped your cocksuck at Captain Brick-Up-His-Ass, okay? - Okay, his wife had two legs and then shows up to a cookout with one. Am I not supposed to comment? - Generally speaking, no. You know you're not. (mellow music) (water splashing) - Jesus. - Do you have my numbers? - Can't it wait till I finish? - The fuck is taking so long? - [Andy] Dr. Shifflett. It takes time to set up the accounts in a way that's- - That's, that's, that. - That's what? I can't. - That makes sense. What I do is art and- - Jesus Christ. - Forgive me for wanting to- - Just sit your ass at the desk and get it the fuck done. Okay? Don't fuck with me today, Andy. We've got Marin Wallace coming in. - Oh, it's today? - I know you've got a thing for her. Don't fucking play coy with me. - I have a thing. She's just really pretty and nice to me. - [Dr. Shifflett] Dude, no one gives a shit. Just do me a favor and don't slobber all over yourself when she gets here. - All right. Can you... I can't finish if you're in here. (discordant music) - You're so fucking embarrassing, Andy. And wash your fucking hands. - Wash your fucking hands. - [Cindy] You gonna sit your asses there and watch Dr. Shifflett's office. - Yeah, I said we're here! Fuck! - [Cindy] Now, don't you get a smartass mouth with me, motherfucker! - We're not, Cindy. We got everyone's profiles and we'll keep you posted. - [Cindy] That is all, detective. - Fucking assbelch. Jesus. - You know, 15 years ago, we just would've gone up there, busted down the goddamn door, guns blazing. Would've had this whole shit wrapped up in five minutes. - It's total bullshit. - Honestly. - Oh, wait. Speaking of bullshit. Would you look at this prick right here? Where's his ski lift? Frosty the snowballs. What a fucking jackoff. - I was hoping. - That Shif would only higher bald pieces of shit to work here? Oh, what? - [Detective Pete] Jesus Christ, right? He looks like a sandwich spokesman. Goddamn. - [Detective Dave] Who is he? - Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, let's see. Fatty number two is Gene, no name. Weird. Ex-CIA. - CIA? - Was canned for extreme anger issues and delusions of grandeur. - [Detective Dave] Sounds like my wife. - [Detective Pete] Recently divorced, no kids. He seems to be a total loser. And my guess is he's probably the muscle of this operation. - Muscle. Looks like a bloated shitstain to me. - Goddamn, I hope he was breathing as he went up those stairs. He's such a fat piece of shit. - Oh, you've been working out? Yeah, I didn't think so. (quirky music) - So you figure out tonight? - No, I can't. I have my daughter. - Hey. I'm not asking. - Oh, does doctor need a spanking? - Oh, I think you know exactly what doctor wants. Yo, money man. - Fuck. - You done yet? - You know I'm not. - What you drinking there? Fucking gravy? (Andy whimpering) Fix your hair. - Fuck this fucking deadline! Jesus! - Seems mad like Ikea's having an online sale, but the shop floor's not matching what the online sale says. - No wonder he didn't have any hair. (detectives chuckling) - Fucking trying to ruin my life. I need more time to do this shit. Goddammit. - If he jumps, you're doing the paperwork. His ass is gonna splat. - [Detective Pete] I mean, I guess the cleanup would be like a hose. I mean, how do you clean pudding off of pavement? - A hose, a fire hose, that's a lot of splat. - You fucking drinking gravy? Shut your mouth, you Aussie fuck. I'm drinking goddamn coffee. You know it's fucking coffee. Don't say that in front of the goddamn receptionist. Just make me look a fucking idiot. - What if I took a shot at him right now? Just in the leg? He wouldn't even feel it. - I mean, does butter feel anything? - [Detective Dave] Well, let's change some lives, shall we? (clock ticking) - I need more time. - [Dr. Shifflett] Gene. Gene here, he's going to babysit you until you're done. He's more capable than he looks. Today. (ominous music) - You should probably go to work now, Andy. (alarm beeping) (phone buzzing) - All right, let's do this. Okay. Let's get this day over with. - [Vera] I'm sorry, I just have to say, I'm a huge fan of your short stories. - There's certainly promise. - Thank you. - [Vera] And we're so excited to have you at Miller and Kale. We're so excited to publish your book. I mean, I cried when I read "Choices". - Yes, it moved me. - [Marcus] The outline, may we see? - I bet she's already into chapters. How many chapters? Three? - Maybe. - Maybe? - Maybe, what's maybe? - I don't know. - You don't know? - My idea that I have will be ready soon. - [Farrah] She's scared. - She's not scared. - Excuse me! - I'm sorry! - Ladies, ladies, let her speak. - I'm a goddamn deer in headlights. - I need a manuscript in three weeks or I will murder everyone in this room. - They hate me. I was supposed to have a draft to them today, and I have nothing, absolutely nothing. You know, I spent my whole life on that first one and it's just the collection of short stories. I'm not a novel writer. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. Why did I agree to this? - [Becky] I'm sure it's not that bad. Writers blow past their deadlines all the time. - They already paid me in advance. I feel like I'm just stealing from them. I still have to deal with dad and I still have to deal with his ashes and his- - The short stories you wrote, your first book, how did you come up with them again? - I don't, I don't know. I- - Fuck you, you don't know. - [Joy] You know, some of them just came to me in a dream or they were just there. - That's right. They came to you in a dream. That means you're a great fucking writer, bitch. Deal with it. I mean, look at dad. He spent his whole life trying to save sea turtles. Fucking sea turtles! Why can't you apply some of that passion to your work? (melancholy music) (Joy sighing) - Okay. (energetic jazz music) (Gene snoring) (energetic jazz music) - [Dr. Shifflett] Really? And who told you that? - My fiance. - Right. And he said they're perfect? - Yes. Well, he said he was happy. - Ah, happy. Right. (Gene snoring) If he's happy, then I guess we're done here. (energetic jazz music) 36. 24. 36. - What would you have in mind? - Well, I have a couple of ideas. (energetic jazz music) How old did you say we were again? - 24. - Oh. I'm going to be brutally honest with you, okay? You're a six at best. My job is to take you from that six up to a ten. Right now, you're hookup material, but you're not marriage material. (energetic jazz music) (Gene snoring) What I suggest is that you let me do my job. I'm gonna take all of this and I'm gonna throw it away. I'm gonna fix it. And then maybe if you're lucky, you'll get to walk down the aisle like daddy's little princess. Okay? Okay. Why don't you grab your clothes and we'll get outta here. - Okay. - Hey. Super proud of your progress. There's nothing to be afraid of. You're gonna look 10 times better. Have a great day, sweetheart. (elevator dinging) (Gene snoring) Is he done yet? - Who? (dramatic music) - What's going on? Peter? (dramatic music) - He took my fucking money. - Marin Wallace! Marin Wallace! Marin Wallace, roll it down, roll it down. Yeah, roll it down. All the way down, keep coming. Peter Shifflett is a fraud, okay? He convinces women to get plastic surgery, even though they absolutely don't need it, okay? I mean, look at you, Marin, you're beautiful. You don't need that shit. Do not get plastic surgery from that guy, 'cause you're better than that, all right? Okay, I'm just, I'm gonna give you my car. That's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna give you my car. Put it on Craigslist's, sell it for $500. Buy yourself something nice just for you. Fuck everybody else. I love you.

Fucking asshole. (amorous French music) (phone buzzing) - Hey, Gene. - Hi, Todd. - It's Bishop. - [Gene] Todd, I've got a job for you. - What kind of job? - [Gene] Oh, just the important kind, that's all. So why don't I text you an address and you get your heinie over there and stake it out. We've got a sweet little baby lamb who's wandered off with something that doesn't belong to him. Do you catch my shit? - No, not really. What does he have? - [Gene] That doesn't matter to you. - It doesn't matter. - [Gene] That's what I said. It doesn't matter to you. - Well, I think it would be helpful to know what this sweet baby lamb has that's so important. I mean, how am I supposed to know how much pressure to put on? - [Gene] He's got a bunch of money that belongs to Dr. Shifflett, all right? He stole it. And we want it back. Jesus. Sense of entitlement in these kids. - [Bishop] I don't know, Gene. Gotta work in the morning. Got a new job, new life, new house, so. - [Gene] No, you don't. You live with your crazy French mother and you hate it. - Look, Gene. - Daddy's not asking, sweet pea. - [Bishop] I know I owe Shifflett a lot, but- - [Gene] Hey. Do you want off my list or not? You do this and that happens. - List? What list? - You know what list, smarty man. You know. - [Bishop] Oh, shit. That list. - Oh! That shit list is right, my friend. Now, why don't you get yourself together, get over there and get this the F done. (amorous French music) - Lights up, Jim Cagney. What's up? No. Throw one away. What's up, bitch? No. What's up, bitch? No, way too much. Way too much. Scale it back. Be softspoken. Be charming, you know? But firm. Chest hair. Eastwood. (dramatic western music) Hey, you scared? Yeah. Yeah, like that. Now... Do me a favor. Don't scream. (dramatic western music) Wow. That's some Oscar level shit right there. - Andy, what the hell are you doing here? Ummmmm $3 million? You stole $3 million from your boss? Are you insane? - No. - You're his accountant. - You know, I was more of like a bill collector really. - [Joy] Yeah, so what you still stole from him. - The guy's evil, Joy. I had to. - [Joy] What do you mean you had to? I mean, you're not a criminal. Your life is good. - [Andy] Yeah, hardly. You have no idea how truly shitty and soul crushing my life is. - [Joy] Okay, why do you say he's evil? - Tax fraud, fraud, evasion. I think he was running illegal prescription drugs with this guy, Gene. He wanted me to set up overseas accounts for him just so he could run. And I almost did it too. - But Andy, I mean, you stole from him. You know he can go to prison for this, right? Where's the money now? - It's safe. It's in a place. - It's in a place. Oh my God, who are you? - I have no idea and it feels amazing. - God. - What if he has guys coming after you? - He's a plastic surgeon from Wilmette, Joy, not a mafia boss from the seventies. He doesn't have guys. - [Joy] Andy, you disappeared the same day his money did. He's gonna come after you. You know that, right? - Oh, wow. Andy's dad died recently. Unexpected heart attack. (phone buzzing) Jesus, he was really young. - Dave. Ahh, Shit. They tracked Andy to LA. - Oh shit. What about Shifflett? - No, he's definitely, he's still here. - Oh, we're good though. Who loves you, kid? - Hey, hey. Hey. Fucker, you want some coffee? Wait, how did you call me last night? - I have my phone. Why? - Is it a burner phone? - [Andy] What? - This is your real phone? - [Andy] Yeah. - This is why you're not a criminal. You don't even have a security code on this thing. Okay, you know what? It's off. Andy, you need to leave. - Ow, Jesus. - I need you to leave. - You know, I'm not trying to get you into trouble. - I know Andy, but you called me so now they know who I am. And I'm sorry, you have to leave. All right, here, I'll give you my number. All right, now, you get rid of that phone and you get a prepaid phone. And don't call anyone in Chicago. Actually, don't call anyone at all, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Now, look at me and tell me that you're gonna leave town. Okay, promise me you'll do that. - My bag. - There's your bag. Here. Now, do you promise me? - No. - Why not? - Please God, with the yelling. - Why not? - Because there's some things I gotta do, okay? - What are you hiding? - Look, it's important. I have to do- - Andy, I love you, but you're being a really big asshole right now, all right? This is not a game, man. - I know it's not game. - This is just some serious shit. Just promise me you'll do the right thing. - I will, after tomorrow. - Oh my God. All right, just go. Just leave. Leave! - Yeah, yeah. Hey, Dr. Shifflett. No, I found him, but Gene texted me the wrong address. But guess what? I tracked that sweet baby lamb's phone. - [Dr. Shifflett] I want him and my fucking money tonight or I swear to God, I'll murder every single one of you. Fucking amateurs. - Yeah. Yeah.

And my boss wants it back tonight, which means I want it back tonight, which means Andy has to give it to me when? - Tonight. - Beautiful. She learns. Now, how do we make that happen? Did he tell you where it is? - He said it was in a place. - In a place. Who the hell talks like that? Come here. Yeah. Me and you, we're in this shit here together, so help me find the money. - You've got a gun on me.

All right, I'll be back. (mischievous music) (phone line trilling) (phone buzzing) - There it is. Get it. - Hey, Andy. I thought you weren't gonna use this phone anymore. Remember, you lied to me. - I didn't have time to get a burner. - You don't listen. - No, they don't know about you, I promise. Are you home now? - Yes. - Okay, can you meet me somewhere? - Sure. - Meet me at Terry Kaufman Park. Meet me there in an hour. - Okay, Andy- - Really?

How could you be so obtuse? Is it deliberate? Shawshank. - Andy and I grew up together and you know she is harmless. - Yeah, well, if old Andy boy was so harmless, you wouldn't be driving around LA with a gun in your back, would you? - Just promise me you're not gonna hurt him. - Would you just drive, mom? Jesus. - You know, you are an adult. You can make your own decisions. I mean, everyone has choices. - Are you quoting your own book to me right now? - Wait, you read it? - [Bishop] Dude, watch the road! Geez. - [Joy] Did you like it? - I'm not really a short stories guy. - [Joy] Yeah, I get it. Totally. Not a short stories guy. - Yours were okay. - 88. - Minus 78. - Fuck you. - Such a good movie. Except for I never understand that last part because he- - Mumbles. - Mumbles it! He mumbles it. Yeah. (Andy laughing) Oh, you ever do that? You ever get like song lyrics wrong or, you know, movie quotes wrong and you realize you've been doing it forever? God, I'm such an idiot. I embarrass so easily too. (Detective Pete gasping) - [Bishop] Yeah, I need you to track that number that I gave you. Are you sure? Okay. Well, he's here. That means get out. (menacing music) Hey, young Teri, what've you got for us? - We tracked Andy's phone to an alley in downtown LA. Found security cam footage. Check this shit out. - We had a warrant for his phone? - Of course we did. (detectives laughing) They must have lured him into the alley. I think there was a money exchange or something. - I don't negotiate with terrorists. Tell me where the money is or I shoot the shit out of both of you. - Put the gun away or the money's gone. I swear to God, it's gone. - Until... (electricity crackling) (Bishop screaming) - Jesus. They tased the guy? (taser crackling) - Great job, man. - What the fuck? So I was bait? - Yeah, I had to get him out here somehow. - Are you fucking kidding me? You asshole. - They threw his ass in the back of a truck and drove off. All right, detectives, I gotta run. - Hey, you sure you don't a swig there, cheese dick? - It'll make the metal in your mouth real tingly. (detectives laughing) - God, I wish I was his age. - Fucking handsome prick. Bet he gets his dick wet every night. - Yeah, I miss those days. - You never had those days.

Of course, he's not lying. - I'm not. - How many people have you killed? - None. - [Joy] Dude, you are such a liar. - Look, I was roofing houses in Burbank a week ago. Look at Andy's pocket. Do it. Get in his shit. - What's in Andy's pocket? What the hell is this? - Is that a prop gun? - I got it one of those novelty shops in Hollywood. Looks real, doesn't it? I know you probably think I'm this international assassin, badass, kidnapper guy, but Shifflett paid for my contractor's license. I owe him. He's the only reason I'm here. - You're a fucking roofer? (ominous music) - We can track Bishop's phone. - I can track any phone anytime. It's what I did for the Corp. You see, Peter... What I did was I hid all of my surveillance equipment in the garage during the divorce. Jackie didn't get any of it. Nope. And it's because she did not know about it, because I hid it in the garage during our painful, prolonged uncoupling phase. - Christ. - [Gene] She did not know about it or that it even existed because what I did was- - [Dr. Shifflett] Just let me know when you find him. Okay, big guy? - Thank you for trusting me. I will never disappoint you. After the divorce, I was looking for purpose and meaning in my life, and you came along at just the right time and gave me an opportunity to sell prescription drugs and murder people for you. You saved my- - [Dr. Shifflett] You should probably crack on now. Okay, Gene? Off you pop. - Want twig and berries? - Not the twig, just the berries. - Come on, bro. It was a prop gun. Shit wasn't even real. We all have choices. Okay, okay, all right. I'll play ball. Gene and Shifflett flew in today. Gene's got a bunch of this really creepy tracking software.

What the hell are you doing? - What, I smoke sometimes when I'm feeling stressed. - [Joy] You can't run away from these people forever, man. Don't you know how this business works, Andy? - [Andy] Yes, I know how this business works, Joy. Don't talk to me like I don't know stuff. I'm sick of that. - [Joy] Fine, okay? But you know I can't go home until we settle this. So I need to know now what the fuck the plan is. - I don't know yet.

(bright western music) (whimsical music) Give me your phone. - [Bishop] Why? - Just give me your fucking phone. - Give her the phone! - Hey! I got pictures on there. - What the fuck is that? - It's a SoCal Special, sir. It's a baby spinach, pineapple white sauce pizza with, well, cilantro, oregano accents, various maudling roots, craned carrot stalk, which you know, all combines for a very- - I thought I ordered a pizza, mate. - It is a pizza. - [Dr. Shifflett] No, that's a pair of panties that you've whipped up in there. That's what that is. Fuck it, give it. I'm starving. - That'll be 34 even, sir. - $34. - Yes. - No tip. - Lesson learned, bitch. - [Dr. Shifflett] And don't you forget it.

But Andy's mine, understand me? - [Gene] Yes. - I can't hear you, Gene. - I said yes, Peter, all yours. - Snookie want some num-nums? (ominous music) - [Andy] All right, we don't know who's out there. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. I think you guys should hold hands like you're a couple. Then you'll go for- Yeah, come on, come on, let's try it. Let's just try it. Pretend like you're a couple, so just, let's just do it. - Don't worry. You're safe. - I'm worried. - Oh, hey, Gene. - Hola. (Bishop grunting) Little shit! I am calling your father the minute I get home, Todd. - I thought his name was Bishop. - Bishop is his last name.

You can come out now. Well... Anyone? Andy, everybody is about to get shot real bad now. Is that what you want? Or do you maybe want to tell me where my money is? - What do you mean your money? It's Shifflett's money. (gunshot banging) (Bishop screaming) - Right in the Rectus femoris! - [Gene] Maybe now you will keep that smart ass yapper of yours shut. And somebody needs to tell Pop Gun Rodriguez over here to lower his eyebrows before I blow them both off his face. - [Andy] All right, all right. Just let them go. I'll take you. (gunshot banging) All right, all right, fuck! Jesus! It's in Venice. - Well, let's go then. Come on, everybody. Let's go. Just the Apache. I don't want you two working out another one of your really smart plans, do I? Come on, let's go. Field trip. Everybody on the bus. (bright western music) (gunshot banging) (Gene grunting) (gunshot banging) Fuck! Really, in the fucking ear? Oh, shit! (electrifying music) Why are you making me do this to you? (Gene grunting) He's coming for you, Andy. And fuck you, Todd. - My God, Mel, are you okay? - I got shot. No, I'm not okay. - What can I do? - You can check this shit out. - Do you always wear a bulletproof vest to work? - Yeah, I work nights and I pull guns on people. Of course I wear a bulletproof fest. - I thought you were showing me your tits. (Mel and Andy laughing) I thought you were gonna show me your tits. - I wouldn't put it past me. - Me neither. (climactic music) Sun's coming up. - Yeah, long night. - Hell yeah. - How is he? - It's just a flesh wound. Don't worry about it. I got a bed over in Sylmar that'll stitch him up. - Geez. Mel, I am so sorry for- - [Mel] For what? For me having some of the most fun I've had in years? Are you kidding me, man? I got my "Fistful of Dollars" moment. I should be thanking your ass. - What about that asshole in the room back there? - Don't you even worry about him. I'll take out the trash later on when the dust settles. - Thanks for everything. (phone buzzing) (phone ringing) - Jesus Christ, Gene, I've been waiting all night. - Gene's dead, Doc. You dick. - Where's my money? - Let's meet somewhere and I'll give it to you. - Just like that? - [Andy] Just like that. - [Dr. Shifflett] Just you, me, cops, fucking FBI? - Nope. Just me, asshole. - Not really getting the angle here, Andrew. - Joy. She stays out of it. If you can promise me that, you'll have your money back. - The big Mexican stays out of it too. - Fine. - I don't know why I'm gonna trust you with this, but... - [Andy] You don't have a choice. I got your balls in a sling. - I'll send an address. - Okay. Fucking asshole. - Babe. Honey. Pumpkin. - You killed a guy with your bare hands. - He had it coming. - I can't believe I saw that. Got one more stop to make if that's okay with you. (insidious music) - Be careful with this one. Be extra careful with this one. It's heavy. If your father knew I was doing this for you, he'd crawl up out of his grave and kick the living shit outta me. - He'd do the same thing to me too. - I don't want to know why or what this is even for. Just be careful, okay? - Look, I know this looks weird, but- - No, you just take care of yourself, son. I hope this helps. (gentle music) - This is gonna help. (insidious music) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God! I can't feel my thighs. Are my eyes bleeding? Oh my God. Oh God. Oh God. All right, 7:45 on the nose. This is gonna sound weird, but pretty sure you're my best friend. - Vaya con dios, amigo. - I had a girlfriend once. (insidious music) I'm here. I'm here. Hello, hello. - [Dr. Shifflett] Ching, ching, money man. You've got a huge set of balls on you. I mean, seriously. Where have those things been, huh? - It's just me. - Show me. - It's all there. I mean, I took some for expenses, but you know. - Where's the big Mexican? - He's Cuban, actually. He's down the street. - Who is he. - A friend. Best friend, maybe? I don't know, I've never actually had one. - Why'd you do it? I mean, you of all fucking people. - I don't know. I just, I guess I just wanted a good story. - Open the bag. - Fuck it. - The fuck you doing? - Getting loose, bitch. - You can't be serious. - [Andy] Oh yeah, baby. You want a piece? You think you can hold hot fire? - Dude, you're fucking hysterical right now. I kind of don't even want to kill you anymore. - Darcie's been cheating on you, by the way. - Oh, Darcie? I have a hundred Darcies. - You'll care when she gets the blood work back. - Okay. This is gonna be fun for me, not for you. You are about to have a very bad night, friend. (thrilling music) (Andy and Dr. Shifflett grunting) (nose cracking) (Dr. Shifflett painfully grunting) That's all you got, isn't it? - [Andy] No. (Dr. Shifflett yelling) - Darcie has herpes, you piece of shit! - Stop saying that! - She's got everything. Real white trash buffet down there. (Andy laughing) (Andy and Dr. Shifflett laughing) - Steal from me, you fuck! I lost my dad too, Andy. You don't see me crying about it. You go to work, you sack up, you do your job like a fucking man. Christ. A luggage lock? - Protection. You'll regret not using some with Darcie. - Stop saying that! She doesn't have diseases. - Yes, she does. - You're a fucking nobody, Andy! A fucking nobody! Give me the key. Come on. Give me the key, Andy. I'm done playing around. You're a fucking nobody, Andy. A fucking nobody! You don't have the balls, Andy. (shrill music) Me on the other hand. (gunshots banging) I hope it was worth it. (gunshot banging) (intense music) - You still think I'm a nobody? - Oh, you fat- (explosion banging) (soft piano music) - Andy! ♪ Born a worm ♪ ♪ Spins a cocoon ♪ ♪ Goes to sleep ♪ ♪ Wakes up a butterfly ♪ ♪ Oh what the fuck is that about ♪ ♪ What the fuck is that about ♪ (Andres speaking foreign language) ♪ Born a worm ♪ ♪ Spins a cocoon ♪ ♪ Goes to sleep ♪ ♪ Wakes up a butterfly ♪ ♪ Oh what the fuck is that about ♪ ♪ What the fuck is that about ♪ ♪ Born a worm ♪ ♪ Spins a cocoon ♪ ♪ Goes to sleep ♪ ♪ Wakes up a butterfly ♪ ♪ Oh what the fuck is that about ♪ ♪ What the fuck is that about ♪ - [Sophia] You know, if they think we're gonna look past this bullying incident, they have another thing coming. I wasn't PTA president for three years for nothing. You know, maybe I should run for superintendent. That'll teach them just. Just in time. Come, come sit. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Come on. You look better. - Thank you. - You feeling good? Eat, eat. Come on. Okay. Because there is dignity in every job. So I told them, I said, "Andres, you need to get back out there and just do something better. I'm so tired of you sulking around. I said, "You will not be a bad example for my children. I won't have it." - Well, thank you- - [Sophia] I know this is about his self-worth, and I know how important it is for a man to be self-sufficient. He's such a good man. (Sophia speaking foreign langue) How are you feeling, sweetheart? I'm sorry we could only use what we had here. - Yeah, sore but better. Thank you. - I can't believe they just jumped you like that while you were moving into your new home. - [Andy] Yeah, this came outta nowhere. - Santa Monica's supposed to be a safe and quiet place. I mean, I can't believe it. - I know. Bad people everywhere, I guess. - [Sophia] Ugh, this world. That's so true. I'm gonna need you to finish that. (calm music) - Hey, are you all right, buddy? - Yeah.

We must have missed- Christ. - Just push it in. - Okay. Christ, man. It's time to go. Shifflett's dead. - What? How? - He got blown up by a goddamn bomb. - Jesus. Where? - In LA. - So... - Yeah. - We blew it. - Fuck it, let's grab a beer. (birds chirping) (calm music) (waves crashing) - Happy birthday, Pop. (calm music) - Stacy. - Yes. - I loved it. - [Joy] Thank you. - Are you sure? - [Farrah] I said I loved it. I loved every page. I also lost my father this year, and I think yours would appreciate the tribute. Thank you, Farrah. - We'll be in touch. - [Joy] Okay. - You know, you're gonna have to write a sequel, right? - [Announcer] Your attention, please.
