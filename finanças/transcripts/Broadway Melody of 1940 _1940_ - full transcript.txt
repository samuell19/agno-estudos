All right, Chinatown. Let's go to Chinatown and the Bowery. Just leaving, buddy. A trip through dreamy Chinatown. - Go away. Go away. - Just a place for a honeymoon. Here, here, here. Tonight's the night, folks. Tonight's the night. It's wedding night at dawnland. Now, we're not only gonna give away this beautiful bride, but four, four rooms of furniture and 50 dollars in cash. This way to the bridal night at dawnland. Miss Martin, meet up with Mr. Jones. - Hi. - Aw, go on. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to again officiate at another one of dawnland's weekly happy events. Through the courtesy of the dawnland ballroom, many a young couple has embarked successfully on the sea of matrimony. - Johnny. - Yes, sir? There's a guy been here looking for your partner. This smiling couple that stands before me, is just another... Where is he? He said he'd be back. And you better scrape up some dough, or he's going to take your pal's suit. Yeah? I'm going to put on your number before he shows up again. Or it might turn into a striptease. Yes, sir. - Now, look, king... - Wait a minute, wait a minute, Johnny. Let me speak first. I can explain everything. I had a chance to get rid of a girl, so I saw her off on the train. Yeah? Yeah. You knew it was your turn to call for the bride. This is the third time I've had to cover up for you. Okay. I'm sorry. I'll take the next three. - Who do you love? - You, you, you silly. Go on, get going. What a guy. And we came to New York to get on Broadway. At least after five years of hoofing, we're in the right town. Yeah, but who knows it except us? Just a couple of taxi dancers. Pushing around a lot of female lonely-hearts at five cents a dance. And doing a specialty act without pay. What a career. You don't feel much like going on, do you, king? Oh, sure. I can hardly wait. If there's anything I enjoy, it's doing a specialty for no dough. All those agents you keep telling me about, be in to see us. I suppose they'll all be out there tonight. Agents just love to come to a dump like this. They expect to find so much. All right, suppose we don't go on tonight? - Huh, huh? - Yeah. You're getting more and more discouraged all the time and you're... You're letting the act down, and that's no good, king. Say, listen, we may never get anywhere. But if we don't think so... I'd rather break it up now. Well, maybe I'm weakening. Maybe I'm holding you back. Maybe you ought to get yourself another partner. Maybe you're right. Who you gonna get? Bill sanderson. Bill's a good boy. If you can still call him a boy. He's been around a long time. Hey, that's us. Come on, come on, get out there. We'll give these people a show. Okay, boy. And remember. You never know who may be out there. So give! Right. We now give you that talented dance team, Shaw and Brett.

You know, the one on the end there. It's very important business. Please get him right away, will you? - Sure. - Thank you. Now, you see why I come to a place like this? You never can tell where talent'll hide. It's apt to be the lowest konky-to... Uh, ko... uh, tonky... The lowest dive. I wish you wouldn't keep rubbing that cape. It's... you"ll wear it out. Hey, there's a gent out there, wants to see one of you guys on business. - An agent! - Sit down. Be right out, classy. Well, come on, come on. What're you waiting for? The guy's liable to get away.

Where have you been hiding? - Where have you been looking? - Everywhere, I... no, that isn't... What's your name? - King Shaw. - King Shaw. Must remember that. Uh, I'll be right back. Here, uh, you... Oh, come on, don't high-hat me, sister. Okay, brother, no hard feelings. Shake. Sure. I once knew the cutest little Japanese banker. - Well? - I just saved your life. - I told him I was you. - But why are you me? Because if a guy had a summons for king Shaw, and handed it to Johnny Brett, it wouldn't be legal, would it? Say, why didn't we think of that before? If you'd stop trying to corner the market on blondes we might keep the suit and the act. Hey, are you sneaking out again tonight? Come on, come on, Johnny. Come clean, tell kingsie. Where do you go every night at this time? I've told you. I take dancing lessons. Dancing lessons. Ho-ho! Who is she? Why, king, I'm surprised at you. Would I let a girl get under my skin? Do you think I could be charmed by a smile or a pretty face? Look at me. Am I the kind of a guy a woman can twist around her little finger?

Clare, darling. I'm sorry I wasn't able to catch the show tonight. Well, I'm sure that Bert saw to it that everything went all right. Everything didn't go all right. Well then, you can use a little good news and I've got it for you. I've got a great surprise for you. It's... oh, no, it's not you. I've... oh, yes. Excuse me, this is miss Pearl delange. How do you do? Hello. Bert, our troubles are over. I've made the greatest discovery of my life. Just what we've been hoping for. I have found Clare's new partner. - Well, what's his name? - Well, I wrote it down. Here it is, Peggy britton, Columbus six... Oh, no, that's something else. Uh, king Shaw, that's it. King Shaw. Wait till you see him. - King Shaw? - Yes. Never heard of him. - But you will, Bert. You will. - We've got to have a name, Casey. Clare didn't have a name when I discovered her. - Why, I certainly did. - What? - Bridget Callahan. - Yes, that's right. And what were you? Nothing but a great big baritone when... when... When I told you how to fix the second act of your show? Yes. No. Well, you did... Was just a suggestion. Yeah. And you made a fortune out of that suggestion. There's gratitude for you. Didn't I make you my partner? - Well, you needed a young man. - What? You were getting old. Old? My hair was as white as it is now when I was 17... 15. Well, I was pretty young. - Bob, he's just jealous of you. - Of course, he is. When're we gonna see this discovery of yours? I'll have him in Bert's office tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock. Come on, Pearl, darling. Let's take this home. It's been so nice having this little chat with you. Yes. Well, come on, my little chatterbox. I'm beginning to think you get more people back here than we get out front. Oh, I'm sorry you were interrupted, Bert. Tell me something. Why do you always propose three days before the close of a show? I mean to do it at the end of the run but... How much do you really want to marry me? More than anything in the world. Bert... I'd hate to give up my career. Yeah. What are you talking about? Why, the new show's all written. You've got a contract with me. You can't walk out on a contra... Say, what are you doing, kidding me? I'm just trying to prove that the theater is your real love. And I guess the same thing goes for me. Yeah. That means "no," huh? Well, let's say it doesn't mean "yes." Just keep the motor running. I may have a little trouble getting my cape back. Yes, sir. You certainly have been nice to me, Mr. Casey. - Ah, well, I... - I mean, about this cape. Oh, well... well... Of course, I hope you won't misunderstand. I mean, about my accepting it. Oh, no, w-well, I hope you won't misunderstand either. Oh, no. I think people can be platonic and still be friends. Well, goodnight, Mr. Casey. Wait just a minute. Aren't you forgetting something? Does Mr. Casey mean his little night-night kiss? Ah, the, uh... Yes, that's just what I mean. Ah, it's been a lovely evening, Mr. Casey. - Thanks for everything. - Here. Oh, Mr. Casey! I understand about the cape, Mr. Casey. No hard feelings. Shake? Oh, well, that's big of you, Pearl. Oh, you knew the cutest little Japanese banker. Uh, come on! Drive like the wind! Come and get it! Hey, king! Wake up! Nice, black coffee for that nice, black hangover. Oh, oh, Johnny, Johnny, don't. Don't, don't, don't, Johnny. Oh, I think I swallowed a cactus last night. Here, drown it with this. Quit pushing, will you? It's those little men again. Here, I'll handle the cup, Johnny. Sure you got everything you need now? Yeah, everything except my health. Hey, where are you going? Matthews and Casey are doing a new show. I just thought I'd drop by. I'll save you a trip. There's nothing there. How do you know? There never has been. There never is. There never will be. Amen. Yeah? Listen to this, "Turner and Farrell got a specialty spot in the new Cole Porter show. And what's more, they worked it up to three and a half minutes." Yeah? Well, Turner must be the manager's uncle and Farrell must know where the body's hidden. Well, maybe I can find a body. So long. Hey, Johnny. When you come back, do me a favor, huh? Don't stamp. I'm in a very delicate condition. Sure. Speak. Hello, is this king Shaw? This is Casey and Matthews of Matthews and Casey. Oh, yeah? Well, this is Shaw and Brett of Brett and Shaw. Say, quit kidding me, will you, Johnny? Hey, as long as you're still downstairs send up a pack of cigarettes, huh? Cigarettes? What are you talking about? You've got the wrong number. I've got... I mean, this is Casey and Matthews. Are you king Shaw? Matthews and Casey? Oh, gosh! I'm sorry. Yes, sir. I'll be right over. And ask for Mr. Matthews. That's my junior partner. Yeah. How did the cape gag work last night? What do you mean, "gag"? I always tell them I'm going to take the cape back. Yeah, after they've wasted an evening with you. Why, you wear out 50 blondes to one cape. Do you think it needs a new lining? You both do. Why don't you ever take me out? Maybe you haven't looked at me. I'm blonde. Oh. Oh, well, the cape wouldn't fit you. Well, if you took me out to supper a lot, I could grow into it. Well... no, I don't think you'd look well in it. I'd look better in it than you do with it. Well, that's beside the... Here. This. That's all. We'll... Oh, uh, there's a lady in the reception room waiting to see you. Oh, really? What's she like? I mean, who is she? - Pearl delange. - Well, ask her to... Pearl delange! And is she sizzling! I think she's out trapping ermine. I'll bring her right in. No, you'll do nothing of the sort, Amy. Tell her that I can't see her. I-I can't see anybody. I'm busy. And tell Mr. Matthews that I've gone to the pelham golf club. No, better make it Westchester golf club. It's further away. Johnny Brett of Shaw and Brett. Any chance seeing Mr. Matthews? He hasn't come in yet. Hello. Hello. And what do you do? - I'm a juggler. - A good one? - Yeah, sure. - Since when? - Hello, Dan. - Hello, Johnny. - Been the rounds? - Just starting. Me too. Do you see what I see? Now you do it. I only do it with plates. Good! Very good. Now you throw it to me. Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. You're a big boy now. Mr. Casey interviews all juggling acts. Come on, Clare. - Good morning, miss Bennett. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Matthews. - Morning. Can't see anyone today. Mr. Matthews can't see anybody today. - I wonder if... - That goes for all of you. Say, sister, did my partner, Johnny Brett, go in there? No, he went out there. Good day. You mean he left? Yes. Yes, why don't you join him? Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, sister. I'm king Shaw. Okay, king, abdicate. Okay, I'll do that. Casey just phoned and said that Matthews is waiting to see me but I'll take your advice. Thanks, sister. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? You're talking. I'm listening. - Mr. Shaw to see Mr. Matthews. - Well, send him in. Yes, sir. - Morning. - Good morning, Mr. Shaw. - This is miss Clare Bennett. - Miss be... - As if I didn't know. - How are you, Mr. Shaw? I caught your last show in Chicago. You were very good. Very good. Oh, I'm glad you liked me. Sit down, Mr. Shaw. Sit down. Oh, sure, thanks. Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. Here, I've got it. Mr. Matthews, here. Let me do that, sir. I wouldn't have had this happen for anything in the world. I think we'd all be comfortable if you just sat down. Yes, sir, thank you. Well, one thing about a little water, it never does any harm. Shaw, Mr. Casey tells me you're a good dancer. Yeah? Well, I... I can't argue with him about that. If you're as good as he says you are, we may be able to use you in our next show. You'd be making no mistake, Mr. Matthews. Johnny and I did a specialty act in a musical show in Kansas City. We did three minutes in one. Stopped the show cold. I don't doubt it. If my partner were here, we could show you the act. - I'm not interested in your act, Shaw. - Oh, but it's great. And I'm not interested in your partner. This is a one-way deal. - No team, huh? - No. You see, we're looking for a new personality, a leading man for miss Bennett. Me? Dance with Clare Bennett? That was the idea. Say, do you mind standing up for a minute? I wanna see how your height would be with miss Bennett. Yeah. Well, before we go any further, I want to see you dance. Have you caught miss Bennet in her show? No, sir. Go see it. There's a number called "between you and me." If you think you can get up in it, I'll try you out with her. Saturday night after the show closes. Gosh, that would be great. - But... - What's the matter? - Oh, nothing, Mr. Matthews, nothing, I... - Still worried about your partner? Oh, a lot of partners in the theater have outgrown each other. - Do you hear me, Shaw? - Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. I guess you're right, Mr. Matthews. A guy's got to look out for himself. Well, it's up to you. Take it or leave it. I'll take it. Hey, where you been? To every agent and manager in town, but I've got a perfect record. Didn't see one of 'em. You should have stuck with me. You'd have seen Bert Matthews. Yeah, I'll bet. What did he do, drop in for tea? No, he phoned, and... I went over there. I met Clare Bennett. Quit kidding, would you? I'm not kidding, Johnny. Honest. It's true. True? Well, go on. What happened? - What happened? - Well, we had a little business talk. You mean there's a chance we might get a bit in the new show? - Now Johnny, wait a minute. - Huh? Do you... Don't interrupt me, will ya? Will you let me finish? - All right, all right, all right. - They're looking for a new personality. They must've caught our act, and... and like you said, you never know who's out there. King, we're in! Johnny, wait a minute. When do we start? What do we do? - Johnny, please. - "Please," he says! Gee, I wish I could have been with you, kid. What'd he say? Come on, tell me all about it. Johnny, will you not get too excited? All right, all right, all right. It's... it's cold. Cold? But you just said... They want one guy... To dance with Clare Bennett. Oh, I see. They want a leading man. Wonder why they phoned us. They didn't phone us. They phoned me. And then showed you the door. You don't rate me very high, do you? They offered me an audition. To be Clare Bennett's leading man? You? Gee, that's great. Why, that's terrific! But what do you mean, it's all cold? Well, what would you have said if they'd offered you a job without me? - Well, I'd... - That's exactly what I said. I said, "look, Mr. Matthews, we're a team and that's the way we stay." Are you crazy? Then he gave me a lot of hot air about what a great opportunity it was but I said, "wait a minute, Mr. Matthews. We've been together five long years. And five pretty tough years." Tough, but a lot of laughs when you think back, huh? You said it. Why, you half-witted... Turning down the chance of a lifetime on account of me. Well, it isn't only a question of you, it's... It's a question of being on the level. What a guy. Well, I know what I'd do. Yeah? I'd get on that phone and tell him I'd take it. But quick. Well, I wouldn't be any good without you anyhow. You know you figure out all the dance steps. I'm not leaving town. I'll be around. You mean you're gonna help me, Johnny? I'll figure out a routine for you that'll kill them. What a guy. But this isn't a sure job yet, Johnny. It's only a tryout. You see, they want me to watch the show a couple of nights and get up in that, "between you and me" number with Clare Bennet. The one she's doing in the show now. She's wonderful in it. Have you seen it? Yeah. She's attractive, huh? Close to? Attractive? She's the tops, Johnny. You've never seen anything like her. Why, from the minute she met me, she acted as though she'd known me all her life. Imagine it! The biggest star on Broadway! You wanna know something else? I think she kinda took a shine to me. Oh, I guess that'd be hard to take. Hey, let's get going. Get on that telephone and tell Matthews it's all set. Well, uh, well, I don't have to do that. You see, we left it like this. If I change my mind, I show up at the theater tonight.

Casey! - Oh, well, I better... - Casey! - I'm sorry, Bert. - Congratulations, Bob. - That boy is a real find. - You mean you like him? Like him? O'Grady! - But... - Take this down, Amy. Yes, boss. Listen. I'm gonna give king Shaw the lead in the next show. I want you to get to work on him immediately. - Yes, sir. - Build a personality for him. Change his address. Take him to a first-class hotel and a good tailor. - Yes, chief. - Let him be seen around the night spots. Get him talked about. Build him up until the customers know the name "king Shaw" - as well as they know their own. - Yes, Bert. But he's not... oh, well, I... - Where are you going? - He's going out to get some air. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. How was it, Johnny? Miss Bennett, this is Johnny Brett. - How do you do? - How do you do, miss Bennett? Is this your partner? Yeah. Good, wasn't he? First time too. Proud of him? - Plenty. - Okay, king, who's your agent? I haven't any. You don't need one. We'll sign a contract, hm? A contract? You'll never regret it as long as you live, Mr. Matthews. Yeah. Change your dress, Clare. The three of us are going out tonight to celebrate. Oh, this is Mr. Brett, Mr. Matthews. He's... How do you do? How do you... Come up to the office, king, and we'll fix everything. Glad to have met you, miss Bennett. Oh, Mr. Brett. Johnny. Look. Come out with us tonight. Thanks. I'd rather not. Thanks. Thanks a lot. So long, miss Bennett. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, here. Pardon me. I'd like to talk to you for a minute if you don't mind. Now, look, you'll be paid very soon. Paid? Do you owe me something? You're not a collector? Collector? Oh, yes. Well, I used to collect stamps, but I gave it up when people stopped writing to me. Don't you remember meeting me four nights ago? Distinctly. You told me then that your name was king Shaw. Gee, yes, that's when I thought you were a bill collector. - Bill collector, me? - Yes, I'm awfully sorry. Yes, well, I'm sorry too. For you. Because that little mix-up lost you the job as Clare Bennett's leading man. What's that? Yes, I thought your name was king Shaw so I sold king Shaw to my associates. Oh, I see. Yes, well, maybe we better have a drink together, huh? - Yeah, let's. I could use one. - Yes. Well, let's... I'm going to clear this whole thing up. You're going to play that part. Oh, no, I'm not. Now, look, Mr. Casey, king's the man for you. You need a personality. Why, he's a natural. Women'll go for him like a bargain sale. They always have. - Yes, but I saw you dance. - Yes, and you saw him dance too. Tonight with Clare Bennett. Why, they were wonderful together. Rabbit? No. You know, you're just like me. I'm always pushing my partner ahead too. But I'm gonna fix this. Look. Matthews is satisfied, I'm satisfied, why shouldn't you be? Well, maybe you're right. Squirrel? No. I tell you what, I'll discover you next year. That'll make me a hero all over again. - I can hardly wait. - Ils it a deal? Sure. That's wonderful. That's the first deal I've been in on in years. - Beaver? - Certainly not. Let's drink to the deal. Don't you think you've had enough? Ah, just one more won't hurt. - Herman! - That's right. Ermine. - Hi, Johnny. - Hi. - Hey, what are you doing? - Getting a swelled head. What? Why, I even know this guy. I live with him. Good publicity, huh? Yeah. - Hey! - Yeah? How'd the rehearsals go today? Good? Oh, a little off, but all right. - Say, king. - Huh? I had an idea this afternoon. You know the step you do at the end of the second chorus? Yeah. Suppose you try it this way. - Say, that looks good. - Try it. Yeah, yeah, that's it. How does it feel? Feels great. You know, I think we can brush up the number in a couple of other places too. Want to work tonight? Oh, no, not tonight. I'm dining out. With Clare? Who else? Oh, boy, what a gal! And fun too. I wish you could see something. Everywhere we go, people start buzzing "look, there's king Shaw and Clare Bennett. King Shaw and Clare Bennett. King Shaw and Clare Bennett. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!™ boy, you certainly are moving up fast. "King Shaw and Clare Bennett.” Well, I think I get top billing with her. You know, Johnny, I never had a girl hit me like this. I always thought I could take them or leave them. Well, here's one that I'm not leaving. And what's more, I think she'd feel pretty bad if I did. If it's Mr. Shaw, I'll be right out, angel. Yes'm. - Shall I offer him a drink? - Well, don't encourage him. That boy don't need no encouragement, honey. - Hello, Clare. - Hello, Bert. Anything wrong? That's what I came to find out. From you. Look, Clare... You've never gone out like this during the last few days of rehearsals. You never wanted to, until king Shaw came along. - Why the change? - I'm having fun. Just watching the kick he gets out of going places and seeing things. Things he's never seen before. You got the same fun out of watching me when you first took me out places. - Not quite the same, I hope. - I didn't mean that, Bert. Is that the only reason you're running around with him? If there were any other, I'd tell you. Look, Clare. Be sure that king understands there isn't any other reason. I will. All he needs is to think you're falling for him and he'll be bossing me around the theater. You know, you're not doing him any good. All that lad wants to do is to play. He should be home tonight resting or rehearsing and so should you. Well, what excuse can I give him as late as this? Well, tell him the truth. That's an idea. No, no, that wouldn't be feminine. Give him the one you always give me, the headache. - Oh, angel. - Yes, ma'am? - Get Mr. Shaw on the telephone. - Yes, ma'am. Well, goodnight. Have a good rest. See you at rehearsal. Goodnight, Bert. Well, sure, I know we've got a tough day tomorrow, but it's no tougher than... Besides, I've got a headache. Oh, oh, I see. Well, if that's the way you feel about it, it's okay with me. Sure, I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Aren't you going out with her? - She's got a headache. And I sent her orchids. Maybe you should have sent her aspirin. Ha ha, very funny. It's a fine time of night to break a date. Just when I was all keyed up to take her out. Oh, it's just as well. Now we can go through that number. Now, how do you expect me to concentrate on a number when a girl plays a trick like that on me? - Maybe she has got a headache. - Yeah? Well, I'll show her. I'm going out on the town. That'll make two headaches. Boy, are you full of jokes! - Hello. - Hello, king. This is Clare, again. I just called back to say I'm sorry about tonight. But, uh... Oh, that was a silly excuse I gave you about having a headache but we do have a tough day tomorrow and... But, uh... Oh, don't argue with me, king. Just say I'm forgiven. Well, at least say something. I love you, Clare. What a stupid guy. You're sure bein' mighty sweet to poor little lonesome Emmy Lou. All alone up north, not knowing nobody. Oh, why, it's a pleasure. - Hi, Emmy Lou. - Hello, honey. I thought you didn't know anybody up north, uh, north. Why, he's an old friend of mine from the south, sugar. Y'all know what it means down south when a gentleman gives a lady a cape? Uh, she gives it back again. Oh, lordy, no, sugar. It means he's got to give her a ring. Hello, honey. It sure is. Why, I declare, sugar, this place is full of southerners. - Southerners? - Makes me feel so safe. It's getting powerful warm here. I mean, for the north. I declare, honey, you're the strangest man. Just like I heard you was. - Oh, did you hear about me? - Oh, lordy, yes, sugar. The cutest little Southern girl told me all about you. - Oh, she did, huh? Well. - She sure enough did. - Her name was Pearl delange. - Delange! Uh, oh... - She told you all about me? - Every single thing. Well, sugar, I guess it's getting powerful late for poor little me to be out. Oh, now, don't you bother, sugar. I can get home myself. Oh, I know, but what about the... the... Down south, the gentleman pays the check. Oh, no, not the check. I mean, what about the... King! King! Eh... Oh, you can't leave now. You've got to meet king Shaw. He's the richest man in the north and the south too. Oh, well, I... might just stay long enough to meet up with him. King, my boy, I'm delighted to see you. Delighted. Meet miss Emmy Lou Lee. Mr. Shaw, miss Lee. Shaw, Mr. Lee. Sit down. Hello, honey. Why don't you ask miss delange... Delee... Emmy Lou to dance? - Okay, em. On your feet. - I'd love to, sugar. All right, everybody. Let's get... What is this? What is this? - Who are these people? - Shh, shh. This is the greatest discovery of Mr. Casey's life. He wants them to audition for you before rehearsal. - That Casey's crazy. Where's he? - He's not so crazy, he's still in bed. All right, all right, but make it snappy. We got a rehearsal. Okay. Okay, boys. How do you do? How do you do? How do you do? Oh, dear me. Fancy seeing you here. Thank you. Can you hear me? That's fine. Very fine. Amy! Amy! That's all, thanks. We'll let you know. Thank you. Give them back to Casey. He deserves them. All right, clear the stage, please. Ready for the harlequin number. Take it from king Shaw's entrance. Give us the pickup, will you? Stop it, stop. Come on. Come on, Mr. Shaw, that's you. What're you waiting for? - Play it again. - Oh, Mr. Matthews. Um, Mr. Shaw isn't here yet, and I'm afraid it's all my fault. Oh. So you didn't take my advice last night, huh? Yes, I did. Mr. Shaw was here this morning, but his tailor phoned. And I thought we weren't going to do the number until this afternoon. - So he went to the tailor's. - Oh. He did, did he? Mr. Matthews. I'm afraid king is going to be a little late this morning. - He's late right now. - That's what I came to explain. Good morning, miss Bennett. See, king's been up all night with a very bad toothache. - Toothache? - Yes, he's gone to the dentist. You mean tailor's. Yes. Dr. Taylor's. You two ought to get together. All right, ladies and gentlemen we'll resume rehearsal when Mr. Shaw returns from his remarkable adventure. It seems he's gone to the tailor's to have a tooth pulled. Oh, Johnny. I guess I'd better go and see if king is coming. In all my experience in theater, I've never met anybody like him. If he isn't interested in the success of the show, he might at least have a little consideration for the rest us. If he doesn't pay a little more attention to his job, Matthews is going to stop barking and start biting. Well, he'll be here any minute. He was getting up when I left. - He went out last night, didn't he? - Yes, he did. Right after I phoned him the first time? Yes. No, no. I-I mean, uh... I-I'll just go out and see if he's coming. Yes. No rush. They've broken for lunch. - Gosh, did you square me with Matthews? - Not exactly. Clare spoke to Mr. Matthews first. We sorta got our wires crossed. She went to bat for me? Yeah. What do you know? - In front of the whole company? - That's right. What a sucker I was last night. She was on the level all along, Johnny. She really had a headache. What a gal. Sticking up for me. - Who do you love? - You, you. You silly. And that's who she loves too. Come in. Hello, darling. I, uh... I'm sorry I'm late, Clare. But then again, I'm glad. If I hadn't been late, you wouldn't have had to go to bat for me. I wouldn't have found out how you felt. Well, I'll tell you how I feel. You don't have to. - Going to bat for me was enough. - I don't know why I did. I'll bet I know why you did. Don't ever do that again. You mean this? Now, would you mind leaving me alone? Say, sometimes I think you don't know your own mind. What's the matter? The more you know about women, the less you know about women. Maybe it's time you found out they're not all alike. Come on, we'd better go through your routine. Routine, routine, routine. Don't you ever think of anything else? Okay, it's your routine, not mine. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, Johnny. Don't be like that. I'm sorry. I... I guess I'm a little over-trained. Okay, kid. Watch this. - Yeah? - That's out. I got a new one. But why do you always have to keep changing the steps on me? It's neater this way. Then you go into the old slap. ♪ I've got my eyes on you ♪ ♪ so best beware ♪ ♪ where you roam ♪ ♪ I've got my eyes on you ♪ ♪ so don't stray too ♪ ♪ far from home ♪ ♪ incidentally ♪ ♪ I've set my spies on you ♪ ♪ I'm checking on all you do ♪ ♪ from A to Z ♪ ♪ so darling ♪ ♪ just be wise ♪ ♪ and keep your eyes ♪ ♪ on me ♪ That was swell, Johnny. Swell. Thanks. I was just limbering up. You know, a little workout. - Yes, I know. - Gotta keep in shape. Uh-huh, sure. I noticed you changed it a little. - Yeah, a little. - King ask you to? No, I just did it by accident I guess. I like it better by accident. You must show it to king. Yes, I... well, I mean, king's doing all right. You know, there's one thing I'd like to get straight. Casey must've seen you dance when you and king were together. I wonder... I know what you wondering, but Casey has the advantage over you. You've never seen king with an audience. That's when he's really great. Oh, I see. And I suppose you just fade in front of an audience. Not exactly. Well, a little. I mean, you know... Well, I guess I mustn't keep you from lunch. Oh, I never eat lunch. Is that so? Do you eat breakfast? I'd love it. Now? Gosh, that'd be great. Only... Only what? Well, there's something I've got to do for king. How about letting king do something for himself? - But of course, if you don't want to... - Want to? Why, there's nothing I'd rather do. Then what are we waiting for? Lunch, I guess. Now, honestly, I wish this thing would stop following me around. It seems everywhere I go, it's in my way and I can't do anything about it. Come on, let's get out of here. Do I really look like that? I don't make your face. I just make your silhouette. So, lady, please. - Here you are. - Thank you. Let's see. Hmm? What seems to be the matter with this, huh? Well, I don't think you quite got her. Now take her nose, for instance. - Her nose... - Her nose is exactly like this. Of course, it is. He's supercritical. You said it, lady. I'm afraid you've hurt his feelings. I'm sorry, professor. - Here. - Oh, thank you very much. Maybe, probably, perhaps, you are not so super after all. Now you see what comes of criticizing an artist? He asked me what I thought. Do you always tell people what you think? Yeah, sure. Amazing. What are you thinking now, Johnny? - I was thinking... - He don't like your nose. No. I was thinking... About that dance you do in the second act. Was that what you were really thinking, Johnny? Yes, really. That first step. I like it. The way you do it. - It's swell. - It's very simple. - I know. - There's nothing to it. Look. Come on, try it. I have tried it, but... I don't seem to get quite the same thing. Let's see. That's it. And you can travel with it too, can't you? Let's see. Simple. Funny, sometimes the simpler the step... What kind of a show is this anyway? Amateur theatricals? How are we gonna open Wednesday? This morning, no leading man. And now it's 2:30 and the leading lady hasn't shown up. Where is she? What are you barking at me for? I haven't got her up my sleeve. - I haven't seen her. - You're not here enough to see anything. - I tell you, I'm not going... - Hello. Anything wrong? Oh, no. No, everything's fine. Everything's dandy. Where have you been? We didn't realize it was so late. - I'll get ready right away. - And make it snappy. Well, what are you waiting for? - Why don't you go and get ready? - I've been ready for two hours. Okay. Then go and tell that stooge of yours that I won't have him holding up my rehearsals. I don't know why he hangs around here anyway. Don't worry. I'll tell him that. And a lot more too. I want to talk to you. Come into my room. Or should I say our room? - What's the matter, king? - So you took Clare out to lunch, eh? - No crime in that, is there? - No, no. We share everything. Don't be silly, king. I know how you feel about Clare. You know I wouldn't double-cross you any more than you'd double-cross me. What did Clare say about me? We didn't discuss you. What did you talk about? The weather? Now, wait a minute. I know you've got a hangover, and you're nervous and jumpy about the show, and you've got to let off steam on somebody but please, don't say anything we might both regret. Oh, you're getting sensitive, aren't you? Not a bit. I'm getting a little fed up with the way you're acting, if that's what you mean. Oh, pardon me. I'm only the leading man in the show. Go ahead, take Clare out, make her late for rehearsals, so long as you get yourself in nice and solid. Don't worry about making a monkey out of me. I'm only the guy that's gonna have his name up in lights. Listen, king. When success goes to a dancer's feet, he's all right but when it goes to his head, he's top-heavy. Say, where do you get off to talk to me like this? I'm wise to you. You're too smart. That was very clever, the way you got that story mixed up this morning out there so as to put me in a bad light with Matthews and Clare. Then you take her out to lunch and do a little chiseling. "It's too bad about king, isn't it? Now, if I was in his shoes..." I don't know why I don't take a poke at you. I know why you don't. Because you haven't got it in you. A guy that can't take it, can't give it, and that's you. You've proved that ever since you got tripped up by a little bit of success. Why, you're not even on the level with yourself. You're always acting. Well, one of your audience is walking out on you right now, that's me. You're staying right here till the show opens. That's what you think. Okay. Hey, you. Come back here. The yes-man says "no." All right. From the beginning. And make it good. And don't stop for anything. On your toes. Here, here. Stop, hold everything! I have just made the greatest discovery of my life. - Will you go away? - No, but you don't understand. This is sensational. You've got to see it. It's a man on a one-wheeled bicycle. He's way up here. And rides out from the wings like the wind. And he comes out here and stops on a dime. It'll kill you. Are you ready, the great capolio? Eh, sit down, everybody. Come on, now. Eh, uh, give us a roll on the drums and on your Mark. Get set. Go. Ta-da! Stop stroking that cape so much. - Yes, darling. - And don't call me darling. The only reason I've brought you out here tonight is because I had to put the cape on somebody and I'm too nervous for a struggle. - Good evening, Mr. Matthews. - Good evening. Oh, good evening and good luck, Mr. Matthews. A very good evening to you, Mr. Casey. - Good luck. - Thanks, Amy. Good evening. Hello. - Mr. Matthews. - Good evening. Hello. How do... Place is just crowded with memories. One row further back, we'd have a good view of Broadway too. Well, I like to sit in the back. I can get out quickly. You expecting trouble? - Program, Mr. Casey? - No, I know who's in the cast. - Aren't they late coming in? - Yes. I'd better tell Bert to hold the curtain a few minutes. Excuse me. Johnny. - Oh, hello, Mr. Casey. - I'm glad to see you. Thanks. Well, your pal had better be good tonight. Don't worry, Mr. Casey, he will be. I'd feel a lot better about it if you were up there. Oh, don't talk like that. He'll be swell. Just you wait. I hope you're right. Uh, will you excuse me, sir? I can't let king go on without wishing him luck. Nice going. - Johnny. - Hello, Clare. Your flowers were beautiful, Johnny. Thanks. It's nothing. Why weren't you at dress rehearsal last night? I, uh, I went out dancing. Well, I'm glad to see you. - All the luck in the world, Clare. - Thanks, Johnny. - Oh, miss Bennett. - Coming. Keep your fingers crossed. Well, well, well. Look who's here. I knew you'd come back. King, what's the matter with you? Why aren't you dressed? You gotta go on. Don't tell me what I gotta do. I'll knock 'em dead. Come on, get your makeup on. - Gotta get made-up. - Yeah, come on. Gotta get made-up. Gotta get ma... Shut up! Do you want everybody in the theater to know you're tight? There you are. Made-up. Overture, Mr. Shaw. Wait a minute. You can't go out like that. Who says I can't? Get out of my way. Oh, so that's why you came back, huh? Trying to keep me from going on. Still trying to double-cross me, huh? Just like you did with Clare. Come on, king. Use your head. I don't like you. King! Come on, boy. Come on. On-stage, please. On-stage, Mr. Shaw. ♪ Whenever skies look gray to me ♪ ♪ and trouble begins to brew ♪ ♪ whenever the winter winds become too strong ♪ ♪ I concentrate on you ♪ ♪ when fortune cries "nay, nay” to me ♪ ♪ and people declare "you're through” ♪ ♪ whenever the blues become my only song ♪ ♪ I concentrate on you ♪ ♪ on your smile, so sweet, so tender ♪ ♪ when at first my kiss you decline ♪ ♪ on the light in your eyes when you surrender ♪ ♪ and once again our arms intertwine ♪ ♪ and so when wise men say to me ♪ ♪ that love's young dream never comes true ♪ ♪ to prove that even wise men can be wrong ♪ ♪ I concentrate on you ♪ ♪ I concentrate ♪ ♪ and concentrate ♪ ♪ on you ♪ Johnny, what's the matter with king? Don't worry. I'll tell you later. I'll get him ready for his next number. You won't say anything, will you? Please, Clare. Here, here. You gotta help yourself a little. What I want to know is, what happened? You keeled over when you came off. When I... - When I came off? - Yeah. You fainted in the wings. You were pretty fried when you went on and, what with all the turns and everything, you were lucky to get through the number. Here. Get into this. Well, how was I? Swell. Gosh, I don't remember. I don't remember anything. Say, what are you doing with my robe on? Um. You almost drowned me when I was trying to put you under the shower. Here, take another whiff of this. Great work, king. Keep it up, huh? Oh, thanks, Bert. Uh, you haven't seen anything. Say, I must have been good. How was Clare? Here, let me fix that. Stand still, will ya? What's the matter? You sore 'cause that I'm putting the show over? - On-stage, Mr. Shaw. - Coming. If you really want to see something good, catch me in this next number. Thanks. I've seen enough. Clare! Well, well. The more you know about women, the less you know about women. Gosh. I was beginning to think I had a permanent lease behind the eight ball. Well, look. What did you think of the notices? Nothing but raves. - I'm glad you're satisfied. - Oh, well, it... it wasn't all me. I came to talk to Johnny and you about last night. Where is he? Johnny? He's gone. Where? I don't know and I don't care. So, you don't care? Well, if those newspapers had printed the truth this morning, you would've read, "while king Shaw passed out, drunk in his dressing room, not even knowing that the show had started, a new star was born to Broadway, Johnny Brett!" Wha... what are you talking about? I'm talking about your first number, Mr. Shaw. The number they're all raving about. He handed you a career on a silver platter. And personally, I don't think you're worth it. - Good evening, pop. - Good evening, miss Bennett. There's your mail. I gave the key to your dressing room to Mr. Shaw. - Mr. Shaw? - Yes, miss. Half-hour. Half-hour. - Good evening, miss Bennett. Half-hour. - Good evening. Half-hour. - Angel! - Yes, ma'am. - Give these back to Mr. Shaw. - Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry you didn't like my roses. I picked them for you myself. Well, what's the matter? You'll never be able to go on. Well, who cares? Don't want to be able to go on. You ought never to be allowed in the theater again. She loves me. She loves me not. Where's Johnny? Don't you wish you knew where he was? Well, I know where he is, but I ain't saying. Where is Johnny? Go on, guess. Where is he? He's down at the dawnland ballroom, right where he belongs. - Bob! - Yes? Bob, king's in there drunk. Take him to your office and keep him there until you get word from me. I'm going to find Johnny. Drunk? But that's terrible! My show! Johnny! Johnny! - Clare! What... - I've got to see you. I must! Right after this is over, wait for me. Clare! This isn't mine. Clare. Clare, you didn't think I'd... I mean, it's the other fella's. - I mean, I wasn't... - You mean, you weren't going to... - Do you think I'd... - Oh, Johnny, I was so... I mean... Johnny, come on! Hello? What's that? They found Johnny? They found him! They found him! - Why, Mr. Casey. - Oh, yes, well, come on. Uh, what are you gonna do with the body? Do you think he's still unconscious? - Hm. And how. - All right. Now, young man.
