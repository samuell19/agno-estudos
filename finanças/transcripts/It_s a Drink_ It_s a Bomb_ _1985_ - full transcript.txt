You really wanna sell it to the Japanese. Don't worry, there won't be a World War. Your mom's leg was broken by the Japanese. That's their problem. Now if they offer a good price and if it's a deal. We can live on it for the rest of our lives. Let's go. The sample you requested is ready. Pay attention to the 2 logos, this and that... Apparently this is a can of ordinary Sarsae. In actual fact it is a very powerful explosive. Satisfied? I think you've brought along the deposit, right? May I take back a sample. Of course, Ronnie, get another can for him. Where's your assistant? I think there's something wrong. Police station. Listen, someone wants to kill me. I beg your pardon? I got a can of Sarsae, it's an Bomb. What soft of Bomb. Miss, your car's very attractive. I saw the same model in a magazine. It's a Ferra...Ferry. Shit. Alright...go on, don't bother me. Make yourselves at home, you're very safe. You really want to compete with this Ferrari. I don't care whether it's a Ferrari or Rivier. I'll make it go bananas. Red private vehicle DA 6063. Stop the engine and get off. Have you given out all your tickets yet. You want me to get you more customers. It's alright. Your driver's license. Miss, your Ferrari is really terrific and eye-catching. It should be very photogenic. If you take a photo instantly, you'll get it instantly. If you haven't taken any, you wouldn't have any. Shut up, you're blocking the traffic. There's no car behind. Sit right, let's carry on with our happy journey. Why are you riding my motorbike. Help. Me help you... who's going to help me. Who the hell are you? He is a killer, he chasing me. Help me please. You still haven't told me who you are. I used to be a laboratory assistant in Physics. Last September, I worked for my uncle who is... I'm not interested in this... I only want to know whether you're a good or bad guy. - I'm a good guy. - What's big deal? Anyway, you got me into deep trouble. In that case, I'll get off to divert his attention. Alright, go ahead. I'm just kidding you. If you're gone, who'll be my shield. Sit tight. What are you going to do. Ride all the way down. Ride all the way down. He's alone, I'll knock him down with all my power. Are you serious? Of course, I'll knock him down flat. - You take the life. - And you... I'll divert his attention. Why are you not going. I couldn't get into the life. Is that so? Let me give you a hand. Please help me. No more space. I heard some engine sound. Don't panic so soon, wait until he comes. Lucky this arrow missed you. It looks great with it on. Gosh, you're doomed. You know how to drive? Is this street belongs to you. I'll distort your face and your mom won't recognize. You think money can save your life. However I won't beat you now 'cos I'm a good citizen. But I warn you, according to the laws of Hong Kong. You've violate chapter 3, article 6, section 9. Paragraph B, subsection A. You've intentionally damaged other's property. Besides, you also intend to bribe the witness. I'll forgive you because you're still young. Or you'll die on the way to the casualty. Now I'm going to write down your car registration. And I'll discuss with you in the police station. Actually I'm sure you regretted a lot now. There's no other solutions. The only way is. So that she can appeal to the Judge. If he's in the mood, he'll sentence you to a year. He's also the killer. Don't go away. How dare you hit me. How about that, grandpa. 2 minutes 10 seconds. That slow. I know you're lying. I'm getting old and foolish. Right, old and fooling around. You're a really mischievous old kid. Look at you, no boys will be interested in you. If you're the only girl in this world, that's the end of the world. I wouldn't dare. What? You're not taking me back. Many boys would love to. I have an important appointment. Your girlfriend Susan came back from Europe. You wanna take her to see the Fireworks. Alright, please give me a break. Get vincent or Edward to keep you company. Forget it, I want to spend a quiet Christmas. Can you leave me alone. It's still early. I'll go back and take a shower and get changed. I won't force you. So long. I just don't care. God damn it, how dare you hit me. Calling station, I'm chasing after 2 male suspect. One of them used a Japanese sword to attack me. I'm still chasing after them. Japanese sword. Nonsense, it's too early for dreams. It's true, some one's shot by an arrow too. I'm also in deep trouble. Someone's using Chinese sword... and rod to attack. I'm counter-attacking him with my Chinese Kung Fu. Go to hell. I...I can't take it anymore. Don't panic, we'll get away sooner or later. Got him. Don't do that, don't run. Are you alright? Don't be frightened, I'll get your revenge. What's going on. I chase... Where's the can of Sarsae. I won't tell you. Miss. Please let go. Are you OK? - Soft drink, bomb. - What? Soft drink, bomb. You OK, me OK. What OK. I'm not OK. A female killer. A killer... If I got you, you're doomed. He is dead. What should we do? Remove the dead body first. Where's the can of Sarsae. He must have told the girl. What? No a big deal. What? It's not necessary for you to say anything... A female killer's caught by a thief. Sir, I got a female killer. Killer? I am not. I used to live over there. I've just been there to ride my bike. The bike looks great. It's a birthday present from my grandpa. My grandpa was supposed to take me back. But he went over there too. So I have to ride my bike alone. This has nothing to do with this case, don't mention. If my grandpa did take me back. I wouldn't have gone to ride my bike. If I didn't ride, then I wouldn't have come here. Then I wouldn't have the chance to witness this case. In that case, I'd have nothing to report to the police. That means I won't be talking to you now. Got it. Yes...What did you see. I saw he and him being killed by him. Who's he? I don't even know myself. After he killed him, he got into his car and went away. But he's still alive. I wanna go, but he got hold of my foot. And then he used a rod to beat me up. Did I make myself clear enough. very clear. But I'd like to listen to him first. Make yourself clear and precise. I'm driving, and he died. So simple. More details... It's not a long story. I was chasing after 2 Chinese male suspects tonight. Chasing. Well, I'm a taxi-driver. But my greatest ambition is to become a policeman. So I always behave like a cop as I drive the taxi. Tonight as I was on duty as usual. I behave like a taxi, as I drive the police. Oh no, I behave like a cop as I drive the taxi. No...I drive the Cop and act as a taxi... Sir, we've searched everywhere. No corpse, no blood, the place's not messed up. That's enough. Sir, he said he's involved. - You witnessed the murder. - Right. You look a bit more sober. You'll tell me the story. It's very complicated. I've got to act the whole scene. I carried that guy in my back and being chased. They chased us everywhere, all of a sudden, this car flied... I don't know what happened and I fainted... I don't know for how long, then I woke up. Through the grass I saw 2 killers picking up this guy. I don't think so. They lifted him up and threw him down. Before lifting him up, did they need to pick him up first. Right, you lie down first. He's still alive. He was talking to me, but I couldn't hear a word. So I pull his body up so that I can hear better. Not really, let me tell you. Get lost. Lie down. I saw you twisting his neck, like this. Not really, you... Right, he chased after me with a rod in hand. Stop, that's enough... The three of you follow me to the police station. I'd like to ask you one more time. You dumped into a guy who was shot by an arrow. You saw someone parked his car illegally. So you walked there, you're a busy body. No, I saw someone parked his car illegally. I'm not a busy body, I'm just a co-operative citizen. Alright...I got you wrong. So you were only chasing after them, right? More or less. You witnessed the victim being killed, right. Yes, he's very mighty. Do you believe what she say. Sure. Do you believe what he say. Yes. Then do you believe what she says. Of course. Have you read any detective stories recently? Yes, Agatha Christie's "Murder by Death". "Murder on the orient express", "Death on the night". "And little niggles", "The mirror crack's from side". That's enough. There's neither corpse nor any suspect on the scene... no weapons, no clues... But there're 3 witnesses. If a judge is to deal with a murder case. If there's no corpse, no suspect and no clues. And no weapons too, how's he going to deal with. That depends on who is the judge. If I were the judge, I'll disguise as if common. And check the case out thoroughly. - Am I right? - Right. Our behavior's world, but you're in complete agree. I can accuse you of libel. You're hinting that we're insane. Do they look like idiots? Hello, how are you? I just saw an extraterrestrial object. It has 2 wings, and was flying in the sky. Did you see it? Yes, I did, it was singing Christmas song too. But it has 5 wings and got a propeller. It was flying all over the sky, did you see it? No. You are drunk. See, I'm not drunk, even he say so. Right, sit down. If I don't lie to him, he'll bother me again. I lied to him. I go and take something. Seems he doesn't believe me. Not us, is you. You are not helping each other at all. Detective. Get the girl next to you to answer the phone. Let the girl answer the phone. - Me? - Yes. Before he died, where he put the Sarsae? Is him. You phone here to frighten us? Do you know who I am? I'm a big fellow... It's none of your business. he say none of my business. I'll say nothing, I won't tell you. What's matter? Killer. - Where? - Here. I should go now. What did he say? He asked me about the Sarsae. No, he wants the can of Sarsae. Here are 3 forms for you to fill in. Go to the above address and take a psychology test. We're perfectly alright, why should we need a test. That depends on the result of the test. I don't care a shit. Now you've got 3 choices. To fill in the forms or admit you lie to us. Or to withdraw your complain. You've also got 3 choices. To eat shit or to eat garbage. Or to go to hell? You can choose one of them. You're talking nonsense. But you're talking nonsense too. - Write it. - No way. Sit down and let's talk it over. We've to withdraw our complain. What? You're really gutless. I won't do that. Then go and take the test. I'll neither take the test nor withdraw the complain. - Shut up. - What. The complain's withdrawn. What. The complain's withdrawn. The complain's withdrawn. very clever... What are you doing? Changing the plate. Have you ever seen James Bond's movie. The spies usually do that before carrying out their mission. So they won't recognize us. Smart guy, you've sort out this complication. - Let me give you a hand. - Thank you. Take your time. I'm leaving now. I beg your pardon? How dare you utter these words? We should be co-operative and united as one. We'll try our best to overcome all difficulties. We'll gather the clues and conclude the case. Right. We'll get together and have fun. I know you're very busy. You have to feed cats, pigs and your folks. Not really. I have plenty of time. I'm not going to leave you alone to take this risk. I've decide to stay, get in. You really think I'm a driver? Change the plate. Hey Lion Head, what's your name? Don't call me Lion Head. I hate people calling me by that name. My last name's Pik, people call me Stewart. Stupid pig. No one dares to call me Stupid Pig. Once a chap called me by that name was beaten up. Calling Stupid Pig, where are you now? God damn it! What's the matter? Spit it out. Where's your location now? What's up? Someone requests your service. I'm already fully booked for tonight. He's your old customer. No way! Louder please. Frequency disturbance... It's out of order, right. Hey, Moustache monkey, am I right? Forget it, my last name's Lam. What's your real name? You've forgotten it. Bo. I beg your pardon? Bobo. What are you mumbling. Bobo Lam. He got a real funny name. Not really, sounds good to me thought. - You want to take some. - No thanks. Don't you want to know my name? No. I'm not talking to you. My name's Cat. Hello Cat. Cake. Not cake. I'm Cat, C-A-T Cat. Cat-Cat, right. Mr Mustache and Cat, additional $10 each. What an exciting day. At the beginning, we saw somebody being killed. And then there's a threatening call. I wonder what will happen next. very simple, we'll carry out investigation. Finally we'll arrest all the spies. Get the killers, destroy their dens... Right. Who are these people? - They are bad boys. - How do you know? Because they killed the chap with an arrow. What if the chap they killed is a bad guy? Then they are good guys. So they are bad guys if the chap they killed is good guy. I don't care that what you said, they're good guys anyway. Good guys. Ask then whether they're good or bad guys. You think I wouldn't dare. Go ahead, they're just behind us. You told me we'll be safe after changing the plate. We are pretty safe mow. Then ask them why they are chasing after us. I'll do that, no big deal. Oh no, it's very dangerous. Don't worry, we're not bad guys. Maybe after we talk it over. There'll be no hard feeling, we'll be friends and... Get along well. Let me go and find out the clues. Idiot, you really mean it. Did you see them killing people? But they're not killing me. We've got to have confidence, just wait and see. You're betting on your life. Have you done them any wrong. Never. Have I done them any wrong. Never. - Then we're innocent. - Right. Doesn't work. Relax, it's gonna be alright. This is my territory. Not for your sake, but for my sake. There seem to be some misunderstanding. To prevent you being injured accidentally. I decided to compromise with you. Shut up, turn around. If you don't compromise, it's your own loss. Tell the girl to come out. Has Lion head really get along well with him. Tell the girl to come out, quiet. I beg your pardon. I told you to got the girl out, hurry up. Louder please, I can't hear you. Do as I said or I'll give you one more shot. You think I'm a coward and be threatened by you. Yes. You're right, Mr. Moustache Monkey. Listen to me? I, Stupid Pig, would like to talk to you. Stupid Pig, what's the matter. You called yourself Stupid Pig. There's a Japanese friend behind me... would like to meet CAT. She's in bad mood, tell him to come over. Alright. I'm not in the bad mood. You are now in bad mood. Sorry, I forgot you're pointing at my back. Get some candies for her from the drawer. There's no candy. Eat...you're always eating. Lion Head's being hold up. You want him to get killed. What shall we do? It's very dangerous. You wanna rescue him. Are you really coming? Alright, you make the right decision. Well, I've got some candies for you. Lion Head, you've dropped something. - Help. - Lion Head, hurry up. Got in quick, watch out. - Open the door. - Hurry up. Why do the good guys want to kill you. Don't blame him, it's only a slip up. Being stupid is not your fault. You're born stupid, it's not your fault, right. Agree. Please let me know if you wanna jog again. Don't endanger the situation. It's all your fault 'cos you wanna leave me behind. Fortunately Cat opened the door for me. Thank you for saving my life. I have a feeling my life no longer belongs to me. I don't know how to repay you. Why don't you offer yourself to her, idiot. Do I really need to do so? That depends on whether you can survive tonight. You know how to drive. You know my car's even faster than a Ferrari. It doesn't help, you have to use your brain. What are you doing? Get down, don't ruin my car. Sit in the front. Stop. You're not allowed to push any buttons here. If you push this and that, it'll be OK. If you push this... we've got to scram. Don't panic, I know of a place which is very safe. Turn left. Turn right. Turn left. Turn right. Straight on. Why am I so obedient to her. Because you wanna court her. I'm telling you seriously... that we'll be running out of petrol. Let's push the car, shit. Let's go and push the car. Hold the wheel and turn to that side. Right, turn right if the car is moving leftward. Right...Ieft...right. Hold tight. Turn off the light. - Are you alright. - Alright. Over there, come on. Don't feel shy. Right, you shouldn't feel shy. Faster, there is. I'm so thirsty, let me find something to drink. How dare she walked in and took away thing like this. Who the hell is the owner of this house? Must belong to either his dad or grandpa. How do you know? Are you her mom? Can be her brother too. You care for something to drink? Help yourself. Goat's milk. Banana juice. That means two coffee right? Make yourselves at home? You like it? Sure, your house really fantastic. The color scheme's very special, it's very... Pastil. Get in a laboratory. It's Pastel... Yes, Pastel... Sorry, I got the wrong word. Excuse me, my Chinese isn't that good. Lion Head, you're terrific, you can even speak French. Make yourselves at home. Don't worry, I'm not pretentious like him. May I take a look at your house? You've got many models of animals. Must belong to an energetic person, right. It's my grandpa's collection. You know the habit of taking exercise can be inherit. It can be found only in superior genes. That's why I guess your grandpa... Iikes exercise very much. Right, my grandpa loves exercise? How do you know? More guessing. But anyway I've got some concrete examined. Look at this colorful model. I'm sure the process of collection was very advantage. Even at the stake of his life. A dauntless warrior in the Sports. As for these artistic masks. It has also undergone similar process. My grandpa brought them from Stanley Market. Is there any banana? I have it repaired for you. You're always trying to get the killer. He almost cut your kidney out for dinner. You really have a feeling for me. She means you're a pig. It's better than you anyway. You look like a monkey and doesn't worth a penny. Stop quarrelling. Let's talk it over seriously. Why does the killer prefer Sarsae? very simple, the killer's very nostalgic. He doesn't like mike when he was a kid. He grew up with Sarsae. Listen to me. First, the can of Sarsae is not for drinking. Second, someone got killed. There must be an important secret related to the Sarsae. - What sort of secret. - How do I know? That means there's no secret. Besides, before the chap died. He numbled the words "You OK, me OK". Cat got it wrong. He was not saying "You OK, me OK". He was saying "You go home, me go home". Before one dies, one always thinks about his home. So he was thinking whether it's your home or his home. Besides saying you go home, me go home. He also mentioned the words "Sarsae, a bomb". very simple; it means Sarsae bomb. The secret's disclosed, it's no more fun. Let's start another game. Come over here please. My grandpa gave me a piano as present. Let me play the piano and you sing as I play. Let me play the piano and you sing. - Why. - l... What. I don't know how to sing. It's crush a simple thing. You should go to hell. - Let me sing it for you. - Ok. "Tonight... won't be just any night." "Tonight there will be no morning star." It's terrible. Close the door. Help... Did you hear me crying for help? I thought you were singing. God damn it. You got the wrong place. Let me count 1, 2, 3 and you'll scream. One, two, three. Here! Go. God damn it. Don't move. Don't move or I'll kill you. I don't feel comfortable in this position. Let's change to another position after I count three. I won't go away. One, two, three. Let go. Let's make a deal. Both of you let go after I count three. One, two, three. You're so damn troublesome. I'm going to get Lion Head. Lion Head, watch out. Police Station, we've got a killer here. The atmosphere is very tense next door. Let me try another method to fix you. Are you really not letting go? You're really very patient. In that ase, I'll stay. Lion Head. Terrific, you go to hell. I told you the can's not with us, Ieave us alone. Take care of your friend. Take your time. What? They're gone, we're looking for them. Listen. If they found the can and surrounding to the police. We can't have a deal. Let's go get them. I'll go to the Police Station. Let's keep in touch. It's no point getting away like this. Even though we make it, we'll be chopped up. I'll call the police to get us. What's the matter? Nobody's there, what do you want? Can I use the phone? Can you use the phone? You should say... Sir, may I use the phone? Sir, may I use the phone? Of course not, or I'll have let him use it. Please sir. Right, we're in a hurry. In a hurry. That's your own business. There's no telephone. He wouldn't allow us to use the phone. Honey, it's you. I wouldn't allow other's to use the phone. Your husband's sleeping. He's having night shift. What is this? Don't force me to say anything. What's that? A telephone. You told me there's no telephone. Hey, don't mess around. No way, I've got to fix him. You've driven your mom crazy and your dad died. And your sister-in-law killed herself, that's enough. You always called your home number. That's why they say you get the wrong number. They're wrong to say this to me. But even though, you shouldn't have killed that guy. Even though you've to kill him. You shouldn't have chopped him up like minced beef. It's difficult to recognize him. How dare he said I'm wrong. He doesn't really mean it. He meant you've got the wrong number. It's very common to get the wrong number. Right...I often got the wrong number too. So it's very normal you've got the wrong number. Wrong, it can make our hearts beat faster. Our eyes blink faster and scream louder. It can even stop us from laughing. Right... it can also drive people crazy. He means to me, not you. You're on his side? Let me chop you up. I'll chop you up...chop... No way...I'll chop somebody up. Get me a person to be chopped up. - The telephone's out of order. - Yes. You've ruined the telephone a duel. Help. Help...call the Police. I can't because the telephone's out of order. Alert the alarm. How? Break the cashier. Why don't you tell me earlier? Killing people because of a can of Sarsae. Chasing after you also because of this can of Sarsae. Exactly you really know us well. This is B.D.O. Wong of the Explosive Unit. Someone reported an bomb case. Yes. Let me handle this case. You'll handle this case? That's terrific. Take care of them for me the time being. I'll be right back. I decided to transfer this case to another department. Another department. This sort of case's not our job. Mr. Wong. Here they are. Mr. Wong is an explosive expert. Explosive expert. What is it all about? Please tell me in details. We've repeated it many times. Have you read the report? Yes, I did. Then why did you ask us again... So do you believe in what we said? Yes, of course. No query. No query at all. Some one was murdered. There's no corpse and no blood, and you don't query. Yes. We're being tracked down and found a can of Bomb. No query. Sure, I believe. There's no evidence whatsoever. I believe. We got away from the killer. Then we go the gas station and broke the window. We saw a mouse biting a cat. Finally we arrived here, no query. Yes. You're lying? How come a mouse can bite a cat. - You're frisking us. - Right. I believe there's a bomb, there's also a murder. You... Don't you tell us that chap say something before he died. What did he say? He said you O... Don't tell him. Why? Because he doesn't believe a word we say. He's only tricking us. Why should I do that? You believe in what even we ourselves query. You think we don't know your real identity. You're a psychiatrist. You're working on a psychology test... To test us out whether we're in sane. - Don't get me wrong. - Let's go. Listen, I'm really an explosive expert. I really want to give you help. Don't trick us as if we're idiots. I've written down your telephone number. We're going to find the Bomb. We'll give you a call after we find it. Then you'll know we're not idiots. So long mad nutcase. That is the parking lot. Bicycle ground, it's over there. The chap could be rolling down from here. You are really very observant. Ridiculous, stupid, nonsense, adulterous. How could a person roll down from here without a reason? Can you give it a try? Lion Head, are you alright? I'm perfectly alright. I just want to prove the feeling of rolling down. Then what have you proved. The feeling is like riding on a cloud. The view's just fantastic, the day's sunny. Get something to rescue him. He is coming... Hurry, pull me up. Come on, bastards, come here. Hurry up, don't bullshit. Do you like to slide when you're kid? Yeah. See, even if I lose my hand, I won't leave you alone. If you're so great, go to kill the Japanese. I'll kill you. Lion Head. I'll chop you up. You OK, me OK. Let's spread. Cat. Hurry and call the police. I think they won't kill me. Cat...don't panic, I won't leave you alone. Run for your life. I'll take care of Cat. Have you ever heard of three on the road? Don't be afraid, Cat. I warn you, according to the police regulations. You've committed false imprisonment. I tell you. That false imprisonment is right... You want soft drink, or your life. Bullshit, of course my life. Where's the can? The can... Lion head, don't say it. Why can't I say it? Because you don't know. Right, I know nothing, how can I say it? If you witness one of you being tortured. I guess you'll tell the truth. Don't beat him up, please don't. He is my brother. You seem to be very concern about him. Yes, we do care about him. You know, I have a soft heart. If he really beat you up, I might say it. - Don't beat him up. - You... Don't! Don't beat him up. Shit you, it's over there. Come on, kill me. I won't kill you. Since you are so sympathy. You can't stand seeing people got beaten up. I'm sure you can't stand yourself being beaten. Yes, I can't stand it. Stupid Pig, I'm sure you can stand it. You can even stand people forcing you to drink urine. Don't be afraid, they won't force you to eat shit. You won't force him to eat shit, right. What's going on? Go and rescue him. Rescue him? No way. Please don't. I'll rescue him for 5 minutes. OK, that's it... Can you give us 5 minutes to consider? You bastard, you made me almost eat shit. You got me beaten up too. You've forgotten me. What? You're the only one who's not beaten. I'll give you a reply in 5 minutes. What shall we do now? We're doomed. Why? Do you know where's the can? No. What about him. He doesn't know. What about me. Don't know neither. That mean's we are doomed. You are doomed. Cat, don't be upset. Even if we were not born at the same date. But we'll die at the same time, cheer up. So you'll have fun. If you're longing to die, I'll ask him to kill you. Moustache monkey. Bobo Lam. Let me ask you. Is there anybody who has been grateful to you? No. I'll give you a chance. Why don't you scarified for us? So that our descendants. That mean he descendant of Cat and myself will be grateful. Oh no, don't leave us alone. If my death will make you remember me forever. I think it's worth it. Hello. Let me die so that you'll remember me forever. This is the most sensible words I ever heard from you. Cat, what do you think of me? Tell me the truth before I die. You're quit nice. Really very nice. Apart from being ugly with frizzy hair... very talky. A bit rough, slow and dumb. You're alright. I don't see other weak points. It's more than enough. Mind your own business, at least Cat understands me. Please, don't be like that. I really hope both of you don't have to die. Let's think of a perfect solution. Nothing is perfect. It's either him or me. Two tigers can't stay together, one woman... What are you talking about? I don't even know myself. Where are you going? I wish you would think of me. Remember me for ever. You only want the can. You think he will betray us. Of course not. He's not that kind of person. You can't tell by the look. Just like me, I look so fierce and rough. But in fact I'm so tender. They for along so well, he might betray us. You'll stay behind as hostage. They'll get you back with the can in return. I've got the can, I'm sure you won't kill me. But I have to tell them where the can is. You traitor, you... - You can go now. - Go. What about you? I'll stay. I'll stay and chat with them. They promise to turn over a new leaf. Don't do it so obviously. Come here, I'll tell you where the can is. Go, and take care of Cat. I'll find a way to get out. Bobo. I was just joking with you. Joking? But I'm serious. What's the matter with you? Don't mess around. What now? It's all set. Come back soon. I warn you. If he's being injured, I'll kill you. Let's go to the police. Wait. Don't report to the police. If you do that, you're expecting a dead body. Let's get Sarsae, they want Sarsae. We'll get Sarsae from place near your home. And let him choose his own. That's damn stupid. A phone call. Who's it? I know what to do, don't worry. Yes. "At this night, there's a person." "Sitting at a narrow alley, starring at the window." "Singing as he's playing the guitar." "With an old suitcase lying beside his feet." "At this night, that same person." "With memories hidden in his eyes." "Tuning from the guitar string is his sorrow." "He sings with despire, again and again." "Why he's still not getting use for it..." "in the empty darkness?" "Why he has to..." "sigh in the wing?" "When can he get use to it..." "in the loneliness." "When can he overcome..." "this sorrow and frustration?" "This night by myself." "l pass by here." "Carrying the suitcase." "l feel so frustrated." "Yet, I have to go ahead." "Facing the wall." "Singing with him." You are so cool. Of course. Another half hour to dawn. I hope your friend can be back on time. They won't be back. They don't know where the can is. I was lying to you so that you could release them. Don't get so excited. Don't you want the can. I'll take you there. Stop. It's here. Tell me where it is, I'll go get it. He only recognizes me. Without me, he won't give it to you. Why, what's the difference? No. Gosh, we can't tell the difference. Let's get all of them, and let them choose. OK. Sarsae. What? - Sarsae. - Over there. Have you moved them. It's always been there. I'll go get it. Are you hungry? What do you want? He took advantage of me. Do you believe I'll beat you up? No. You should apologize to her. No way. I'll count to 3, if you don't apologize. - I'll beat you up. - 1, 2, 3. Beat me up, come on, help yourself. Sorry...it's misunderstanding...Iet's go. Why don't you beat him up? Let's go, can't you see he is so tough. You are a coward. Come on, I won't fight back. Sorry. Alright, behave yourself! I'm not going to excuse. I scared them away intentionally. How can I give it to you in front of so many people? OK. There's nobody around? Go get it. It's over here. Which one is it? Not this one. Of course, I won't put the real one anywhere. Which one is real? Don't panic. 1, 2, 3. Also 1, 2, 3, Seems like it's over here. No, it's over there. Bye. What are you doing? I said Goodbye. All depends on you, Bye-bye. It's gonna be alright, take it easy. Lion Head, I'm over here, CAT. Bobo. Fantastic, Mr. Moustache. How did you get away? I thought the 2 chaps will kill me. And then. I assume I couldn't get away if I'm over there. So I've go get them out instead. You won't believe what happened afterwards. Where are you going? I'll get a drink for you. Lion Head. Sarsae. Where? Over there. I finally got it. I told you it's here. Hurray. - Mr. Wong. - This is he. We've got the can of bomb. What? Where are you? I'll come and pick you up. We are at Shatin. We'll meet at the Tai Po Station an hour later. Should we take it to the Police Station? To play safe, I'll pick you up, Bye. They got the Sarsae bomb. I'm leaving for Tai Po station. I'll contact you when I got there. This tastes good. What are you doing? We've found the Sarsae, you should be happy. That made me upset. Why? Because we have to say goodbye. Brother... Please take away this can of Sarsae. Put it in a secret place, we will find it again. Why should we go through all these troubles? If you hate it so much, I'll drink it. - He is an idiot. - I know. Eat something. We should go out together. We shall be good friends. Just like brothers and sisters... There's no soy sauce. We should add some soy sauce. Right, that's important. People called me soy sauce when I was a kid. Really? What did people call you when you were a kid? - Make a guess. - Shrimp dumpling. I love shrimp dumpling. I was called shrimp dumpling. What a coincidence. Do you love it? Watch out. You understand the situation now. We're in trouble. - What should we do? - How should I know? Don't look at me. Where should we go? The bill. You want Sarsae, not lives. No way. This is so important. I can't give it to him. Bo doesn't want it. What can I do now? No. Go. How did you ask him to give you the Sarsae. It's simple. If he doesn't give it to me... You'll fart a hundred times in the restaurant. Watch out. Be careful. Let's get off the car. That way, hurry. Come here. I'll draw their attention, you go in hiding. What about the can? Just like you. Hide it away first. And get it back later. Come here. Freeze. Mr. Wong. The police got to apologize this time. Where's the can? Let him have a look. Wait. We got the can after all these trouble. Will we get a Good Citizen Award? Certainly. Give it to him quickly. A phone call. Just look at him, this is a mobile phone. They're very co-operative. With the police, I think we won't bother you. We'll bring it to the police station by ourselves. Why you've to take such trouble? Mr. Wong is also a member of the Police. Right, I'm an explosive expert. It's just the same to hand it to me. Right, give it to him, it's the same. If you don't give it to me. I'll accuse you of storing a bomb for private use. If I don't give it to you, will you shoot? Of course not, it is no big deal. Right, it's no big deal. Stupid Pig. Right, he's a mad nutcase. Let me tell you. Don't mess around or I'll beat you up. The can of Sarsae belong to us. Don't move or I'll shoot. Alright, let's die together. Get in... What the hell is going on? Let's go to the police station first. Sir, three people would like to see you. It's them again. Here we are. We're making a glorious come back. Look at this, do you know what it is? What do you want me to say? This is the can of Sarsae bomb. I bet you won't believe us. Why don't you've it checked up? What's the matter? You come in the right time. He invented the bomb, he's a bad guy. That can is a bomb. How does it, it's incredible. How come there's such a tasty bomb? Excuse me, Sir. I know they're messing around. You... Forget it, let's go. Don't get in the way. Don't go away. I'll accuse you. You still get so excited after all these years. They don't look like bad guys. Alright, it's OK. You may go. - But... - But what, let's go. There's no reason. How come he's so kind and release us? You think he's a good guy. I just don't get it. How come it's not the same? Right, you were holding it all the way. We just went... Let's go. Why are you towing away my car? Sir, my car has been stolen. Because there's a bomb in your car. What? There's a bomb in my car? What's up? You're bad guy, we're not your friends. We'd like to be friend with you and give you a life. No thanks, we're not going. You'll change your mind after looking over there. Grandpa. Your grandpa? What the hell do you want? - Let go my grandpa. - Right. Nothing serious, we just want to give you a life. It's inside. Please be co-operative because his life's at stake. Don't worry, Grandpa. We'll be together again sooner or later. Come on, he's not your grandpa. Somebody feels jealous. Mommy. My boy. Mommy. My boy. Mommy. Who's your mother, go to hell. Over there. Leave it here and follow me. Give me the money, hurry up. I don't believe you, I won't give it to you. Come on, give the money. I won't give any of my money. What do you keep your money for? - Let go of me. - Give me the money. ee, she won't give any money to me. I won't be with you if you stay with these bad habit. - I'll slap you for saying another word. - I won't talk to you. You're a bit too much. The old man's in your hand, don't get so excited. Follow me. Where's the can of Sarsae? The one on the top. If it's not the one. I'll kill you. Wrong, it's the one under the clock. Which side? The side with 2 cans missing. Let's see how to fix it. Ladies and gentlemen, when it's 12 o'clock sharp. We'll start this hilarious Sarsae game. I'll press this button. All the cans will fall down from here. Whoever finds the cap with the word "Gold" written. He'll get 10 taels of 999 gold. Go ahead and have fun. You want some gifts? Gifts. Can't you dress up more properly? I've got myself ready for action. Go rescue grandpa. He's not your grandpa. You got any aeroplane models? No. I'll press the button, they'll be killed by these. How can you be a Santa Claus without aeroplane model? I'll quit. Lion Head. Miss, who are you talking to. Don't pretend. Why are you always able to recognize me? What are we going to do? Hold this, move as I tell you to do so. So long... Have I made myself clear, any problems. You got some problem. Behave yourself. No. Please tell me if you got any problems. You've got to say it out. - This is your friend. - No. Alright, then tell me your problem. If you have any problem, just tell me. Why 2 cans are missing? This is not a problem. Security, please fill in with 2 other cans. To be fair. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, here are some presents for you. Let's go. What did you do to that girl? None of your business, get lost. None of my business. Grandpa, thank you so much. Are you alright? You press this button, all the cans will tumble. The force's very powerful. Alright. Go and search for the gold. Here. Give it to you. No... - What's going on. - Call the police, quick. Don't open it...Not this can. Cat hold it. Hold this. Freeze. Where's the can? You're being surrounded. Give it to me. Release him first. A Bomb. Freeze... It's you again. Mr. Wong, you're with them. They... We made it, the mission's very successful. Thank you for our detective Lion Head and Cat. And most important, to thank Mr. Wong co-operate. You bastards, you're doomed. We finally get you. Mr. Wong, are they really informers. Of course, or else Mr. Wong wouldn't have release. - Mr. Wong. - Yes. Under the intelligent guidance of Mr. Wong. Yours, Moustache monkey. You've betrayed me. No...I didn't...Don't shoot. You don't have to deny. You used the Sarsae bomb to lure me. Or else you don't realize how tough is Mr. Wong. Don't listen to him. We mean to make a deal with you with this bomb. If we want to trick you. How came we let you kill my assistant, right? Because you don't expect me to kill him. You don't even expect me to kill you too. Don't... Freeze. Finally the bad guys are arrested. You know we didn't lie to you. If you wanna know the truth, ask them. Take them to the Station. Let's go. What's the matter, Mr. Lee? There are 3 people, one of them is a driver. Stop it, it's irrelevant to this case. If not because of them, the case won't be concluded. If this case's not concluded, we won't be together. It's getting very complicated, let them talk to them. We made it at last. That's why it's impossible not to kill them. What shall we do next? Back to normal. Right, shopping, going to movie, sleeping. Come here, Lion Head. Lion Head, there's one more bastard. You son of a bitch, I'll beat you up.
