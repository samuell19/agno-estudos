I'm so frustrated, I could... You're frustrated? What do you have to be frustrated about? Anyone with a life like yours would be happy! What's wrong? Do I look happy, in your opinion? You've no reason to be unhappy... - You don't know the reason? - No, what's the problem? You don't even know. No! Sure, you'd never know. That's why I'm frustrated! Then what about me? What about me? I let all those chances pass me by. Why is it always me to make sacrifices? This is the wrong time, you know that. Why? It's the perfect time! The kids are older, and we need the money! No need to bring that up. Just stop. Forget it. - Then when did you ever cook? - Chan, eat breakfast. When did you wash the dishes? Hey! What? I did! No way. I did! I did! How many times? In all these years? That's what your problem is. Right. Two or three times, and you condescend to me. Yeah sure, you're right. Mom, let's have breakfast. Dad too, let's eat. Hana, who asked you to make breakfast? Aren't you late for school? She's just telling us to eat, why yell at her? Cause she's just a kid! What? Always trying to cook when nobody asked her to... Dad, can I have $10? What's with you? I gave you $50 on Monday. You spent it already? I'm not asking you, Mom! Did you skip your class again? Cut it out, will you? Is $10 enough? My god. You aren't even going to ask where he spends it? It's just $10! - You shut up! - Come on! Just knock it off, will you? Quiet, quiet! You know why 5th grade vacation is most important? Why? What happens if you don't work now? - You don't work your whole life! - That's right. Okay kids, have a good vacation. Have fun, and I was about to say goodbye... What now? I forgot the Good Classmate Award. It's such a precious award! Just one student per class. And now! In first place! The Good Classmate Award... No drumroll? Lee Hana! Come on up, Hana. Yoo-jin! Yoo-mi! Come on, let's go. - It's fun. - Uncle, give me that. We should go to the beach. I want to go! Uncle, come here! Let's send him off on his own. How much did you pay for this? I was surprised to hear you got an award, but sure enough, this one suits you. Mom, so what will you do for me? I got first in my class. First? For the Good Classmate Award. What do you want? I don't want a present. Instead... What is it now? Let's take a family trip. To the beach. - A family trip? - Yeah. Since you're only free on weekends, July won't do... You think weekends are free? I have to clean, buy groceries, cook side dishes... Mom, I'll buy groceries and do side dishes. Why should you do that? Our homework for vacation is to make a cookbook. So I should shop for the groceries... It's not so simple! You know how busy Dad and I are. Whatever, discuss it with your dad. Hi, Dad! Hi... Were you drinking again? Yeah. Look, I got an award! Wow, that's quite a feat! Of course it is! You know about these things. You did well. I've got a wish. A wish? Tell me. I'll make it come true. Let's take a family trip. Let's go, right now! Dad, not now! Since you mention it, should we take a long trip? - My damned boss is going to Hawaii. - Don't talk nonsense, all right? Mom, Dad's just a bit drunk. It's my fault. Hana, what's Mom's problem? - I was talking to you. - Quiet. If you're drunk, go to bed! Don't make any more promises you can't keep! You're good at talking. You're all talk. Want me to show you? Chan... Should I quit tomorrow and buy a plane ticket? I don't know how I had kids with a man like you! Tell me about it! Chan, can you tell them you want to take a family trip? What? A trip with things like this? You remember when Mom and Dad were at each other's throats, then things got better after our family trip. I don't remember. You really don't remember? That day they fought like crazy, then we disappeared and they made up while looking for us. Shut up! I don't remember! Why are you getting so mad? You're making me mad! What did I do? I just... - What do you want me to do? - You're always like this. I need to breathe too! So you've been holding your breath until now? When did you ever cook or go shopping? What? Ground pork, beef, bread crumbs, ketchup... How many portions? Four, please. Four portions? All right. - So you like dumplings? - Yeah, I do! Hello. That looks good. It's mine. Yummy. - Go on, now. - I'm okay. Yoo-jin! I can't believe you. What are you doing here? Are you her sister? Yes, I'm sorry. Hurry up! What are you doing? Come on! Hurry up! One more! Yoo-jin! Sis! Hey! Over here! Yoo-jin! Huh? Your name is Yoo-jin, right? Yeah. But who are you? Do you know me? I was at the grocery... But why are you alone? Weren't you with your sister? Yeah. But I lost her suddenly. Really? Where? I don't know. What's your sister's name? Yoo-mi. Yoo-mi? Yeah. That's my pre-school. Where is she? Let's go. Hi! Hi! Yoo-jin! What are you doing here? I looked all over for you! I looked for you too. All right, let's go. Just a minute. A present. Who's that? You know her? It's Hana. When I got lost... Rolled Omelet Hana, I'm home! Hana, what are you doing? Mom, when did you get home? What are you doing with all the lights out? What's that? This is the homework I told you about last time. It looks nice, right? Oh, my. And if I cook side dishes, it's good for both of us. Why should you do that? Have I ever not cooked for you? That's not what I mean... Then why waste your energy on housework? You want me to send you to a study institute again? Never mind, then. Oh right, have you seen my envelope? What envelope? Mom, I think I found it! What? I can't hear. Wait till I finish washing. Okay! Application for Overseas Transfer Proof of National Pension Enrollment for Expatriates Rules for Expatriate Employees Working Overseas Chan, look at this! It's got Mom's name, Germany, starting from November... Just leave me alone! I'm busy. But look! It says Mom's going to Germany, right? Doesn't it? Then she's going! What do you want me to do? She can't go to Germany! If she goes... Where did you find that? I told you not to go through their things! That’s not the point… Chan... Why Can't We Live Together Anymore? Happy Living Apart What's up? Happy Living Apart Something besides cookbooks today? Oh, not this one... Why not? That's a good book. What I mean is... I was looking for another book. What book? A travel book. Travel books? They're in a different section. - Hold on. - Okay. Section Chief Joo Hello? Where are you? How could you just leave like that? We were going to drink more at my place. Damn... Hello? Honey! Say something. Is someone next to you again? Honey! Damn it... Is it ringing? I think it is. Wait a sec. I don't hear it. No, I think I heard a vibration. Damn. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. Hana! What are you doing? Nothing. Why? Have you seen my phone? No, I haven't. Did you leave it somewhere? I'm sure I had it last night... Where is it? Hey! Yoo-mi! Hurry up, Hana! Her stomach hurt all day, and she threw up. Was it something she ate? What did she eat? This. It's not expired. Just an upset stomach? Do you have a pin? - A pin? - Yeah. It's okay. It's okay. It won't hurt. Here. Yoo-jin, look at me. It's okay. All done! Wow, the blood is black. Right? That's how it comes out. You okay? You even burped! Good girl. Hi, Mom. She's sleeping. She ate too much for lunch. I think that's why. Yeah, she's all better now. You don't need to worry, Mom. Right! Yeah, so Uncle said he'd be home early today. He said he'll buy us really good fried chicken! Okay, talk to you later. You live with your uncle? Just during vacation. Sometimes my mom and dad work in the countryside. So my uncle comes and stays with us. The countryside? Where? Was it Bori Beach? There's a huge hotel being built, so they went there. What work do they do? Papering. They put up wallpaper. 1. Listen to your uncle 2. Wash up and eat properly 3. Don't fight 4. Don't turn on the gas 5. Call if you're sick 6. Come home before 5pm Hana! Huh? What is it? My uncle is buying fried chicken. Want to eat with us? No, that's okay. People should eat dinner with their families. What's that? Ah, this... Can I leave this at your house for a while? What is it? It's nothing important. It's just... All right, I'll keep it. Really? Yeah, really. Thanks. Hi, Yoo-mi. I got home fine. Really? You must be hungry. I haven't yet, either. I should have just cooked something at your place. Just a little. Next time should I cook you something? Where's the milk? - Here. - Low fat! This one? This one. It has a screw top. There they are! Which one should we buy? Taste good? - Yes! - Delicious. When I make these at home, they don't taste as good. This has garlic in it. It's healthy sausage. That's why it tastes better. I'll get this one. Yoo-jin! Down there... is that right? Hana! Yoo-jin, stick it here. My turn now. What's that? Wow! It's so pretty! Mine is the yellowest! Where's the ketchup? Here it is. - Me first. - Okay. I'm going to make... A heart? Join it up here... Oh no! Lick it off! How do I lick it? What a mess! Cut the egg. Cut it? With this. You can cut it with this. How is it? It's great! My heart melted. Is it good? It tastes really good! You're red, here. Hana... That's so funny! Our Family's Tomato Plant Warning: Don't Eat! – Oh Yoo-jin What are you doing? Did you pick our tomato? No, I didn't. It fell on its own. I won't eat it. It's okay, you can eat it. Yoo-jin, come here a sec. Why? Hana, you come here a second, too. Me too?? Hurry! Forget it! You just keep living your free life. I'll take the kids to Germany! - The kids? - All right? And then you'll go back to forcing them to study all day! I'll do whatever the hell I want! You aren't even fit to be a father! Not fit? You didn't even want kids! That's not true! You just worried you'd fall behind at work! And what did you do the night I said I was pregnant? You got drunk and acted like the world was ending, didn't you? You said it would kill your career! It was you! No I didn't! For god's sake, stop it! Did you hate having us so much? Then why'd you do it? How long will you keep fighting? If you're going to split up, just do it already! Chan, it's not that. Chan... Hana! Is something wrong? Nothing's wrong. - I'm going to be first! - What should we eat? Do you have anything? No... There are lots today! What are you doing? Looking for something? - Looking for boxes. - They don't even ride a bike. Why keep it here? Who's that? - Look at all this junk. - The landlady. And this wasn't watered, so it's dying. Hello. Yoo-mi! I told you not to look for boxes. You make such a mess. I'm sorry. Who's that? I see her a lot lately. Hey, these days I can't reach your mom. Her phone's broken, so she uses my dad's. Really? Then tell her I'll put the house on the market for her. And tell her to call me! - Ma'am! - Yes? You're renting out our house? Yeah. Why? You're moving. Moving? Yeah. Tell your mom to call me! What's wrong? Are you worried about moving? It's not that. I'm used to it by now. You've moved a lot? Well, six times? Maybe seven? But I didn't know we'd move again so soon. Why is our home so messed up? My home is really messed up too. How? Things are really bad between my mom and dad. They fight every day. - Really? - Yeah. Sometimes my brother gets mad and fights, too. This time they might really split up. But, I'll keep them together. I'll protect our home. Yours, too. Our home too? How? If we try everything, something will work. - Everything? - Yeah! One by one... Building it up like this. Like this? Yeah, like that. Can we do like this? And like this! Then, like this. This one? Yeah, that. Hana, give me the one you had before. This one? We've got purple too. Let's use purple, too. Is pink better than this color? Pink? Or you can do purple and pink together. - Me too! - Look. Wow, can you open it? Wow. Isn't it great? Yoo-mi, here. Yoo-jin, is this okay? Yeah. Show me your hand. Yoo-mi, let's use this too. This is Hana's. Put it back. Let's use it! No. Give it. Yoo-mi, give it to me. What are you doing? Hana... Wow, what's this? What's this one? And this here? Let me see. It's a bankbook. A bottle. Is it alcohol? Whose is that? What? Whose phone is it? I want to see, too. This? I'm so nervous. But who are we doing this to? A really bad person. A devil! Section Chief Devil Joo! Okay, okay. Devil Joo! I'll listen too! I can't do it! Hey! I'm shaking! I'm adding another coin. Hey, Devil Joo! Do it like you're mad at me. All right. - Then I'll really do it. - Like you mean it! Here we go. Don't you laugh, either. All right! It's ringing! Oh my god! Hey Joo! Don't be such a tramp! Drink by yourself from now on! Stay home and poop! Get a grip on yourself! Oh my god! Yoo-mi! One, two... I'll hold it from below. She's here. Huh? It's her. We'll carry that. It's okay! - No, we'll take that for you. - I said it’s okay… Oh my, who cleaned that up? I can't believe it. I can't see. Hana, didn't your brother say he's going to his class? Exactly! What's he doing there? Yoo-jin, come here. Stay back. Chan! Yoo-jin! What's with your clothes? My sister insisted on washing them herself. You're all pink. Let's eat, I'm hungry. Where should we go? A convenience store? Wait. Your hand! Look, Hana! Let's follow them. Ta-dah! For our 100-day anniversary. A couple bracelet. I made it myself! I worked really hard to learn this from my friend. Thanks so much. Close your eyes, I have something. - Oh my god. - Open them. Wow, it's so pretty. And one more thing. Really? Here. Hey, how did you know? I really love this! Did you remember me talking about it? Of course. Thanks so much! He's got a girlfriend! Lee Hana! What are you doing? What are you doing, skipping class? Who's that? Your sister? Hey, get over here. Come here! Give me your phone! Hey, Chan! Then, maybe... Yoo-mi, it's the landlady. Open the door! Yes, just a minute. Spacious, right? Come inside. You, too. Thanks. Excuse us! It's a big kitchen, right? Yes. Good for cooking. Not many homes in this area are so spacious. She's the village chief. She can solve any problem. - Let's look in the room. - Okay. Hi, kids! Hello. You were doing homework? This way. Looks different than from outside? It's quite roomy. And lots of windows, so it doesn't get hot. Yes it does! It's super hot! Right, Yoo-mi? What do you mean, hot? It's perfect. - Really hot... - Go out and play. It's cool if you open a window! This way. Yes. The room is nice, too. It faces south so there's lots of sun, and the walls are insulated so it's warm. Just turn on the boiler briefly and you'll be warm. No, it's freezing! I mean, that's what I heard. Right, Yoo-mi? Hey, you don't even live here. Cute kids. Take a look around! The room is nice. How much for monthly maintenance? No maintenance fee! I just take $10 a month for extermination. You know how I hate bugs. No way, there are tons of bugs! I saw a spider this morning! I saw a cockroach! I saw a moth and a caterpillar before. - I saw a queen ant! - That's right! So, shall we look at the next place? Sure. She's very clean. The kids like to fool around. I know you're busy. Let's go to the next house! I'm at home. Never mind. You guys go ahead. I'm not feeling well. Chan, let's tell him. What? The thing we agreed on. No way. - Want me to tell him? - What? You were like this, and this... I took photos. Should I tell him? - Dad! - Damn it! That looks good. Want some? No, I'm fine. Go ahead. I'm fine, really. What is it? Dad? Yeah? - Shall we go on a trip? - A trip? I need to write a field report. It's for school. Just wing it. No need to stress out. It's really important! And Chan said he wants to go to a top high school. A top high school? Yeah. But these days, Mom and I... What? Well, it's more that Mom's busy. There's lots of work. Then you can do it? Sure. But I'm sure Mom's busy. Then at least you agree, okay? Sure, but Mom... She won't be able to. She's busy. We'll take care of that part. I'm home! Mom! What's this? Why's everybody gathered here? What's going on? Chan has something to say. Let's go on a family trip. Is this some kind of disease going around? You know how busy Dad and I are. Dad said he'll go if you will. Move this off the table. You'll spill on it. Why are you so...? Anyway, I'm really busy now. I have to pull an all-nighter. And no more talk about a family trip! Hurry up! It's Hana! Where are you going? I'm heading to your place now. Not now, Hana. Come quickly! Why? Yoo-mi, where are you going? They want to see the house! Hey, you come here. - What do you keep telling these kids? - Have a nice day! What's with you? Get over here! Hey! Hana didn't make us do it. She's nice, don't keep saying that. We just had to go out quickly. Wow, it looks yummy. I'm thirsty. Can I have some water? It's in the refrigerator. Okay! There's milk! What, you don't like my house? No, it's really great. It's not great. It's just a house. No, it's much nicer than my house. My house is kind of bad. Why? I mean... We don't have many toys... We don't have a rooftop like yours. No tomato plant, or flowers. And then... - Hurry up and eat! - All right. I almost spilled. Oh no! Yoo-jin, what did you do now? What, did you spill? What is it? That's okay, we can wipe it up. Hana! What do we do? What? Just wipe it up. But it's... Oh no. Yoo-jin. Yoo-mi Mom. Did something happen at work? Mom, yesterday, by accident... I spilled... ...milk on my computer? Huh? How did you know? Come here. Come on. Why didn't you tell me? You thought I'd be angry? No. I thought things would get worse between us. Why would that happen? Who knows... Then we won't be able to go on a trip... A trip? Do you want to go so badly? Should I just ask for vacation time and go? Huh? You and your brother are making such a fuss. I guess we'd better go... Yoo-mi! Yoo-jin, how are you doing? Hana, you aren't mad anymore? What? Yoo-mi said you won't come here anymore. Why wouldn't I come? I brought lots of boxes. Wow! Were you really worried? Because of the computer? It's fine! It worked out well. What did? Because of that, my mom is coming around to our family trip. - A trip? - Yeah. Yoo-mi! You're home, right? It's clean. Open the door! It's me. You won't find a rooftop like this easily. Our village chief keeps things nice. Hana. Hana, what are you doing? Yoo-mi, open the door! Six! Seven! Eight! Hurry! I know you're home! Yoo-mi! I can't believe you kids! Shh! It's okay, I have a key. I guess nobody will come see our house now, right? Of course not! The rumors must've spread! Did you see the look on his face? It was so funny! - That guy looked so disgusted. - Right! Wow! Wow! All done. It's like a real house. I want to show it to Mom and Dad. Right? We should decorate the roof. - With markers? - With markers? You read my mind! Wow, that's pretty! It looks great. Oh, hi. Mom! Why are you home? You're not working late? Not today. Go wash up. Come home early, will you? But why are you all home? Is something going on? Nothing. Then let's all eat together. I'll cook. Chan, what do you want to eat? I'll make it. Why do you always go on about eating! Are you a kid? Just eat on your own! But, it's nice to eat together. What's so nice about it? But it is! I don't want to! Chan! Don't yell at your sister. She's so annoying. Hana. Come here. It's okay. Your brother's in a bad mood today. Why? We said we'll go on a family trip, but he says he made other plans. A family trip? Yeah. He's the one who suggested it. Hello, sir. Yes, actually I'm at home right now. What is it? Go and wash up. Okay. Mom. Are we really going on a trip? Yeah, this coming weekend. Let's talk when Dad comes out. So many bills to pay... Traveling in Korea You're just returning books? None to borrow? No, I can't this week. I'm going on a family trip. Oh, really? When? The day after tomorrow. We were planning on Jeju Island, but there are no tickets, so we can't go there. Still, we wanted to visit the beach... I think you've got a call. Really? Excuse me. Yoo-mi! You'll redo the wallpaper? Don't worry, she's going to completely redo it. You again? Stay there quietly. Then, can I use the rooftop all by myself? Sometimes I go up, to water the plants. Since you're asking in such detail, it seems you're interested, right? Yes, as long as the terms are okay, I'd like to move right in. When is it possible to move? The sooner the better! Great, I can move next week! Next week? That's not what my mom said. Does my mom know? This is for adults to discuss! All right, Mom. Let's talk later. First, let's eat. We need strength to think well. Come on. I'm back! Oh, you must be hungry. Give her something. Sun, we're going to Jeju Island! What? Dad got tickets? Of course! You doubted me? I'm the one who bought them! And found a hotel! Hana. How many days? Hana! What? You'll stay with us? Huh? That woman will visit the house again this weekend. You'll stay with us then? But I'm going on our family trip. The family trip? Yeah. Summer's ending and I thought we couldn't go, but it happened all of a sudden. I really need to go, to bring my parents back together. And then your home, too... Yoo-mi. What's wrong? I just thought of something I need to do. - Yoo-jin, let's go. - Why? Yoo-mi! Dad, where are you? But we need to pack. Really? Okay, come soon. Don't drink too much. Yeah. Mom? It's me. Mom's working late. But we're leaving tomorrow... What's all this? For a family trip, we should prepare! It's been so long. Hey, this is no use. Don't you get it? Forget it, what do you know? Hello? Bora! Yeah. Hana, are you sleeping? Poor kid. Are you home? Huh? Yeah. I'm late... Still need to pack. Do you feel okay? Yeah, I didn't drink too much. If you're too tired, we can postpone it. School is starting up soon. Better to go now. I'm worried about Hana. She's so looking forward to it. The kids must suspect it already. For now, let's just say we'll live apart for a while. Yeah. Let's wait for the right time to mention the divorce. I thought when we signed the papers it was over. Right... Let's wrap things up well. For the kids' sake. Mom Be sure to call me. I'll call by tonight. Have a good day! If she wants to live here, why make such trouble? All young people are that way. I ask a little more for the deposit. But she wants new wallpaper, new sinks, bars for the windows. There's no crime around here! Yoo-mi's family was always happy here. They never complained about anything! You know... I'll phone Yoo-mi's father and tell him they can stay. Why so rash? She said she'd decide by tonight. Let's just wait. Why won't Yoo-mi's dad answer the phone? He's not answering? No. He's never not answered like this. We need to talk to him quickly. But weren't you going on a family trip today? Not today. We moved it to next week. Yoo-mi, should we go find your parents? Now? Yeah. Let's go to where they work, and tell them. How? It's so far away. We'll need to transfer buses. Then we'll do it. You said you know where they work. I just know the name of the beach. You said it's a big hotel? People will know it. We'll ask! Still, how could just the three of us go? Let's go! What if that student calls first? Hana, where are we going? Nowhere, Yoo-jin. We're not going? Let's go! But still... Yoo-mi, carry this for me! I told you it was too heavy! But we need to show Mom and Dad! This way? Where do we go now? That way. Okay. Sorry! Dad Hana. What? Is something wrong at home? No, nothing's wrong. But why don't you answer the phone? It's your dad. It's no big deal. Don't worry about it. What is it? Something just came up. What? Is it something bad? Yoo-mi. I'm kind of tired, can we talk about this later? All right. Yoo-jin, come back! Yoo-jin! Yoo-mi, you should hold her hand. Okay. Yoo-jin, be sure to hold my hand. Okay. Chan What? Answer the phone. It's your brother. It's okay. Why do you keep sneaking glances? It's not that... You have something to say? No, nothing. Hana, when do we get to the beach? Yoo-jin, we're almost there, so sit tight and face forward. But still... Yoo-jin! Where are you going, kids? To Bori Beach! This bus doesn't go there. What? They changed the route. You need to switch buses. - We're late, hurry. - What'll you kids do? What do we do? Where are we? Hana! What? How long before the bus comes? It'll come soon. Don't worry. But it's already past 2:00. They said it's a short bus ride. Let's wait a bit longer. But what if like last time, it doesn't go to Bori Beach? That bus's route might have changed, too. I'll figure that out. But how will you figure it out? Honestly, you don't know well either. That's why we keep taking the wrong bus and getting lost. Here. Hana. Hana! What now? Are we really walking to Bori Beach? What else can we do? The bus isn't coming. But what if we get lost on the way? That's why I'm checking the map. But still... What else can we do? Let's just go home. Go home? After coming this far? We might get lost, then we can't meet Mom and Dad... - Better to go home and... - Hey! If you don't trust me, you find them! That's not what I meant. I'm just worried. But Hana, where's our paper house? The paper house? Yeah. I forgot it. What? Hurry up, there's no time. Why? Where are we going? Yoo-jin. Come here. I'm scared. Oh my god! Stay away! Hana, there! The house! Damn it! Why'd you bring this heavy thing? Should've left it there. No, I need to show Mom and Dad! You need to meet them first! How will you find them? Why get mad at Yoo-jin? It's true! With no phone now, I can't use a map or answer calls. Will you pay for it? You don't answer calls anyway. What are you talking about? You think I don't know? Your trip was canceled, right? So you're mad and won't answer the phone! That's not it, okay? And what do you care, anyway? Don't interfere in my business! - Yoo-mi, can you hear it? - We're not strangers! Why do you talk that way? Yoo-mi! What? Do you hear that sound? What is it? What do you think? What? Why is nothing here? Yoo-mi, where are we? This isn't right. Is this Bori Beach? Hana! Hana! There's nothing here! It must be a different beach. What'll we do now? I don't know this number. Mom? Where are you? Why didn't you answer the phone? It's broken? Something really important happened! So we came looking for you, but... Hello? We could've just stayed home. Then the phone would work. But look what happened! We have to move because of you! Why because of me? You had to move anyway! We could have stayed! But because of you... Why is it all my fault? I was just trying to help you! You didn't help at all! You ruined everything! What did I ruin? And it's just moving! What's the big deal? What do you know? You never had to keep moving to strange places, with no friends. What do you know? You can still live with your mom and dad! See them each day, eat together!
