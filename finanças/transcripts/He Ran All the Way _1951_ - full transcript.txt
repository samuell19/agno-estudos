Nicky! You were hollering in your sleep. Hi, mom. Hollering in my sleep, what is wrong with that? It's eleven, Mr Roby, you can't lay there all day. Beat it! Blow! Cut that out! You're a man who will be out to look for a job. If you were a man I'd kick your teeth. Coffee on the stove. - Don't ever talk to me like that, Nick. - Even talk to worse. Only by you, you dirty pup. And now go off, mom, you got too big a hangover. I'll kill you, if you talk like that. You're losing your punch, mom. Nick! Hey, Robey! Where you think you're going? Hi, Al. What place were you in? We would be in Lumbody's almost two hours. I slept late, I don't feel so good today. I slep late. Want a day you sleep late to pick this one? I know. I had a strange dream. And I'm telling you, I'm not so lucky today. I tell you. You know, I got no luck today. I'm runing... When do we get Lumbody? I can't stand to listen to your dream. Listen. I was running so hard in this dream. My lungs were burning up. And I see this... I had a dream of my own. Florida in the winter, mountain in the summer, top through all the way! It is the jackpot, you and me and no nickel stuff. It's the cooling machine. I did not tell you how it ended. I had to shoot this guy and I was... Look, Al, it is hard luck day for me. Let's do it next week. Get your dandruff out of your blood! Get the jackpot next week. May be next week, you will have toothache or... ...may be another dream... ...or maybe ankle aches. I got enough left for both of us. Did you bring a gun? No I.., I... Okey finish the beer and go pick it up. Listen, Al! What do you say? These squats are waiting for their pay. Have I got news for them. What if he comes with somebody? He comes alone. I've seen him a dozen times. Suppose... Leave it to me. If Slum makes a move, it doesn't matter Let me handle it. - Suppose, something happens? - Nothing is going to happen. Look here! It was nice. Now you walk slowly and stick with the crowds. Stop! Nick! Get a doctor! Somebody get a doctor! Operator, operator! Send an ambulance! Someone has been shot! Take it easy, now. Here they come! "Just walk slow and stick with the crowd." "Stick with the crowds..." "Stick with the crowds." 75 please! 75 please! Sorry, mate. Jolly, Jolly, wait for me! Men's Lockers. - What about the odds? - I can't tell. Rats! We got a good description of his partner. We got the whole area covered down to the beach. How long would Cullon be conscious? With a bullet in his spine it requires a while before getting squeak out of him. Keep working on him. If he comes to we'll get all we want to know. Are you all right? I'am sorry, I bumped into you. I'm just learning. Look! If you really want how to swim good, just remember one thing, "relax". Like this. Watch me! You see? Yah, it looks easy, but I don't see how the water acts under me. - Come on, you try. - No, I don't think I could. I will help you. All right. You know, you are too tense. You just lay back on the water and relax. Like this? It's easy. - And now, try the kicks along. - No, I couldn't. Turn around. I got a hold of you, don't worry. You are too stiff up front. Now, kick your feet below. Come on, harder. All right, that's fine. Kick your feet turning round. Go on. Thanks. I got to going now. You haven't learned anything yet. Yes, besetting. I got to go.

He is not exactly a newspaper reporter. But he has a very good job in the paper. He works downstairs in the printing room. He is a press operator. Sit down. Tell me about your family. I haven't got a family. You are alone? I am sorry. There are a lot of worse things, I guess. Would you like something to eat? Later. Maybe, you like to settle a while. We could go for a walk... or may go dancing somewhere. No, I don't want to go out. You got a radio here, haven't you? We can dance here. All right. You hold me so tight that I hardly breathe. That's the way I dance. There are other ways. Let me show you. I dance the way I like to. We do not dance the way you dance. Relax. Remember what you told me: relax! If you don't like the way I dance, we don't dance. Sorry. I do not feel so good either. Excuse me. I don't mean to hurt your feelings. Forget it! It is not you, it is me. You are nice. I just had a bad day. I do not feel so good. You are awfully warm. That feels good. Wonderful! Let's cut it out! - What is the matter? - Nothing, nothing! I wish I know how you wanted me to be.

You'll prove it to you. Mr. .... Not, you down. Go into hallway. Go on! What are you doing? The cops don't get into house. They are not cops, they're neighbors. If you don't send the cop away, he does... Dad... Did you bring anybody with you? What? No. Are you alone? What are talking about, baby? Come on, let us in, babe. What did you put the lock on the door for? All right, Tommy. What is this lock out, honey? Yes, why did you get chain on it? Stand still and keep quiet! - What, what has happend? - Mother, do what he says. That's right. You can't pick my... We are not rich, Mr. Martin. Whatever you want, take it and go. I do not want anything. Shut up. You too! My name is not Martin, it is Robey, Nick Robey. Come on, come on. You work for newspaper. That shooting and the heist, that punk! It's me, Nick Robey. I must have read that story a thousand times. The only one identified was a man named Molin, Al Molin. That is right. You cheating! I'm not kidding. I run over it a thousand times. I told you. I should have told you. I am running all day, I better catch my breath. I got to have time to think. Leave me alone. Go on! Go on! Hey! Is there any other way out of this place? I'll find out myself, anyway. Okey. Hit the sack. And remember, I don't want to hurt nobody. Nobody. It's my fault. I brought him home. How could I do such a thing? How could I make such a mistake? How could I think he was nice, even for a single moment. Something wrong with me. Real wrong. Nothing wrong with you, child. Don't forget, baby. We all fooled around too. Not the way I was. Okey! Okey! Break it up! Come on, Peg! Fred... What can we do? What can we do? There come cops! Call them! When hear them coming, he got Tommy in there He couldn't, he wouldn't. He knows as long as he has got Tommy, we can't take a chance. He is like a mad dog at the resting. Unless we don't make a move to catch him, he won't hurt us. We got to keep quiet. Pretend we were asleep. Tomorrow morning he will be gone. Hey! How is to feel to shoot someone? Do you ever kill bug with your gun? Did you? No. Why don't you go to bed. Go on, knock off! Take it easy, Peg. Your family is allright. The kid is asllep. Don't be scared. If I only get off this merry go round. figure things out... Nick? The police don't even know your name. You'll be allright, you could go away. How soon after I leave with you tell them Nobody would tell them. I wouldn't let them. I promise, I'll keep you safe. Would you, Peg? Would you, really?

The only friend he has in the world is Al Molin. Al was his body. Come on, Lady, where is he? You tell me, you know everything. We know him somewhere here in town. If he tries to get in touch with you, you better tell us know. It'll make easier on you. That'll make it easier on all of us. Where can I get him, Lady? Get him! Kill him! Kill him! Now, get out of here. Go on, get out! I'll tell you what. I'll take all feet you see like this. slip up on him while asleep. or maybe out of a window when his back is turned. You forget he had a gun too. And supposing you missed? Look, are you a red blooded man or ain't you. Take it easy, Sam, remember I told you this whole thing is purely hypothetical. I read it in the book. What would you think about telling the police. You said this guy is a cop killer, didn't you, like this Nick Robey. You ever seen a fireman? Shup, shup, shup, they break everything up, so put out the fire. Same as cops and cop killers. Telling the police is the last thing you should do. How does it end? Your story. I do not know yet.

Nothing was going to go wrong. They think just because they got me on the radio, I'm going to walk in and hand myself over. Sure! Why don't you go now? It is your only chance. What chance? Are you kidding, Lady. I got 10 thousand bucks. I was almost killed trying to get my hands on it. You think I would give it up, do you? I got big plans. Florida in the winter, mountains in the summer. So why are you staying here? I'll get out, as soon as I... What are you doing home? It's my lunch hour... I could not work, I was worried about you. Where is Tommy? Down at the playground. We are both allright. Mom, let me talk to him. What kind of outfit are you on? Are you a waitress or something? I work in a bakery. What do you want? I know you don't want to harm any of us. But if you stay here, you will. Something will happen and you will have to.. So please! For me. Leave us, go away. When you met me you liked me, you said. I was in the jam. I wouldn't look at you twice. Go back to the bakery. You... do you want me to get out of here? Do you want to help me? All you have to do is... ...make a call for me. Call my old lady. You said you were alone. Forget it! Call on me any way she says, any place. I need a car. Tell her, I need a car. Tell her, plenty of money for her. You tell her that. She'll like that. Plenty of money! Mrs. Robey... But he's your son! He needs you. Mrs. Robey... Mrs. Robey... Babe, I was here once before today. I was calling his mother.

Don't come home. Dad... What ware you going to do? Don't you worry about that and just do what I say. - Thank you very much, Sally. - That's okey. You haven't forgotten tonight? Pick you up at you house at 19:30. No... I can't go. I had all the trouble I want you get you a date. I know, Marge. I'm sorry. I can't. Look, Peg! You're going to have stopped this little girl stuff and start mixing people that'll help. You'll have to start taking you chance. Margin? Suppose, I took a chance... ...and turned out all wrong. Suppose, he didn't even like me. For a reason of allergy too conservative? You are shy. You got your hair fixed, put a little, lipstick on and got dressed, you will get a guy to do anything you wanted him to. - You really think I could? - Sure, I do. What time is Peg coming? Mrs. what time is Peg come home? That's no concern of yours. I didn't ask you she was any concern of mine. When does she come home? It all depends. Maybe she has a date tonight. What do you mean, all depends? Don't you care what she does? We trust her. Peg is a good girl and we trust her. We trust her? Suppose, I told you can't. Stop saying these things. Suppose I told you Peg goes for me? No. Please no. Shall I tell you how she goes for me? Thinks I'm great. You are a rotten! What is wrong, Mrs.? My finger! The needle! Tell me what to do. Tell me! Tel me what to do. I don't know what to do. Tell me! That's all right. I just fainted. Please go away. I take care of it in a minute. Only don't touch me. - Who is it? - It's me! Let me in, will you? Scared to death? Take this stuff in the kitchen. Mom? Where are you, mom? She's in here. She hurt herself. - Mom, what happened. I hope you have nothing. - I've nothing She had an accident. You hurt her! I will kill you! Tommy, stop it! I will kill you, you, dirty coward! Now, look kid! He's just a baby. Go to it. Do anything you want. Dirty big coward! Tom, stop it! Good evening, Mr. Dobbs. How is Mrs. Dobbs? I haven't seen her today. Fine, fine. Dad... Tommy! What is the matter? What is it. Are you alright, Tommy? - And your mother? - She is okey, dad. What are you doing in here? He sent me go out to get some stuf for dinner. I do not want to go back there. It is better, Tommy. Because he said so? You could have to do everything he says. Couldn't you? He is the boss. That's pretty good, ha?? What about the liqueur? I gave you money for it, didn't I. I paid for it, but they wouldn't let me bring it. Hey, come on! Soup is on! You sit there. Come on, pa! Sit over there. Mrs. you can get the coffee later. How come Peg is not in? Baby would work tonight. Quite a lay out, ha? Banquet. By the courtesy of Nickles Robey. You think your stomach can take as much as your eyes. Mrs. you aran't supposed to do any cooking. Look at this turkey! Isn't that something, ha? What's that? This is our dinner. What about all this? That's your dinner. I bought this stuff for everybody. Eat the turkey. I like stew. I get it. Okey! But you are going to eat my dinner. There is something you cannot make people do, Nick. Tell me about it, pops. Everybody gets to the point where they draw a line. Once that line is drawn, you can't force them any farther. Not even with a gun. Not even beaten to death. People are like that. You read that in books somewhere. I think, it's dead wrong. You will eat my dinner. No! You eat my dinner or one of you walks out with a bullet in his head. No, you wouldn't do it. What do you mean I wouldn't do it? I'll blow your silly brains out. If you kill us, it'll be for a better reason than this. Take just one shot. That raises the neighbours. They'll call the police. What damage you do, you'll still wind up a dead man Wouldn't be worth it? Pass me the butter, would you, Tommy, please? You forgot something, pop. Most people don't even hear a gun when it goes off. When they do, they think it something else. Once in a while, maybe. But when your own life is at stake, not a good gamble, Nick. That's right. Only you just made it a gamble I got to take. Carve the turkey. Carve it! Please, Fred. And Lady.. take that stew, or whatever is it, dump it in the garbage. Bring out clean plates. - Who is it? - That is Jack. Liqueur. Did you hear something like a shot? I can't say that I did. It must have been some car backfire I guess. Good night. Let's eat. Funny thing, all I've asked you people just for a place that hold up a couple of days. That's all. Something you've given alleycat. What do you want? I can't sleep in there. I must sleep in my own bed. You better do what I tell you. Peg will be awful mad if she finds me in there. Get back in there and go to sleep. - Where're you going? - I am thirsty. There is nothing he can do about it. So don't worry. Listen. Where is Peg? Where is she? Why isn't she home yet? She better get here. All Right, Mother. Get some rest. Where were you? - Where? - At some of my gir friend's. - Why didn't you bring the guy up with you? - I was with my girl friend. Bad chance! Why didn't you come back in with Tommy and yourself instead of the old man. Your mother won't have anything to do with you. I wanted it to tell you. I'd have cut your head out. Why don't you? What difference would that make? What do I mean to you? Peg? Come here. What do you want? You are different. You go for me, don't you. Why? - I do not know. - But you did go for me. Yes. Nice. I just bought it. I had my hair fixed. For me? Don't! Listen! Want me to get out of here? Both of us together. I do not know. We can go right away. Tomorrow. How could we? I got plenty of money. You go buy car for us in the morning. Tomorrow's Sunday. Lots of used car sellers are open on Sunday. Get a good car, baby and nice car. Would you do that? Will you do that for me? For both of us, Nick. You are for me, aren't you? All the way. And I am for you, just you. That's pretty good. Why don't you go to sleep and cut it out? And don't tell me you're thirsty either. Come on, hit the hay! What does she say? Why did she come back? She was asleep. I covered her. Mother, why did she disobey me? Why did she come home? Why? Why? We are family, her family. When she is here, she feels safer. Fred, we'll never got to get out of this. Not alone. Let me go to the police. They will figure something. I know they could. Fred, what are you going to do? I will see. You just lie there. Don't even move. Please, Fred... This rabbit has real guts. You wouldn't get it anyway. Must the old lady and the kid do spend the whole day in the church? Where are they? Louise had been home by now. Today, I don't believe they'll be in such a hurry. At this time we present Reverend Charles Collins and your weekly sermon, the Sunday Rev... What is it? What is that church stuff do for you anyway? What does it get you? For one thing, it makes the man understand the nature of love. The faith of the someone else does more important thing than yourself. Your family is more important than both of you. And every other human is the member of your family. What is that holy joe like you get out of life? What do you want on a life? Be left alone, to work, be left alone. What does a person like you get out of life? Me? Kidding. More than you will save in your whole life. What good is it to you? You will never spend it. No, that's what you think. Where do you think Peg is right now? Marge's or her aunt's perhaps. Does her aunt sell cars? No. So, she is not at her aunt's. She is out spending 1,500 bucks of my money. You're lying. She is out buying a car, good car, for me. She won't get your car. She couldn't. Would you want to bet with me? I'll give you odds. She would have told me. I know. She's my daughter, she never lied to me in her life. You're making it all up. Her, maybe she just said she'd get your car. That's it. She is playing along with you. She is not even coming home. The first night I came here, she said she'd kick me safe. She came home last night, didn't she? Why do you think she came home for? Dobbs, take it easy! Relax. I want you take it easy? Get out, get out before something terrible happen. Listen! When I leave, Peg leaves with me. You do not have to wait for her. She is not coming back. Don't you understand, I don't want you anything. I don't want you anything. Don't spoil my chances. Nick! It's me, Peg! Nick, they said... I told you she'd come back. I didn't started. He almost ruined everything. The keys! The keys for the car! I haven't got them. I told you. Where are they? The headlights. Something was the matter with the wiring. They are going to deliver it later. When? When, later? In an hour. I told them to deliver right out front. Out front, that's good. So it's true. You did get it for him. I'm going away with him. Why? Why? Is that a sacrifice for us, for mother and me? Is that it? It won't help us. You're part of us. What are we going to live for, we lose you Do you think he loves you? He Doesn't. He doesn't know what the word mean When he's used you, he'll leave you, kill you. - Kill you and stuff your body under a cover. - Listen, you... Got to be able trust and love you? He can't trust anyone. I have to go with him. I am leaving. Daddy! If you want to stop me, shoot me! Go on. And don't try anything funny. Because Peg was with me. She is with me all the way. Fred? - Peg is going away with him. - Why? - I do not know. - Fred, why? I do not know, but... Get away from here and keep Tommy with you. Go your sisters. Fred, whart are you going to do? Don't! Or he'll kill you. Maybe? Maybe I'll kill him. She is not going away with him. Now, do what I say. Get going to your sisters'. Fred, I won't take a chance of losing both Peg and you. Fred, do you hear me? I can't understand how, how it feels you're not goimg to get away. flee. They said they would park the car in front of the house? How long they say would take? Don't worry, Nick, it'll be here soon. Maybe you should not have taken that car. There is something wrong with the lights. But they didn't tell me till I bought it. - Maybe... - I filled up the papers. - Maybe you should have got another car. - Nick, it'll be here They promised me They'd hurry. - You're really coming with me, aren't you? - Sure, Nick, sure. Your things, aren't you going to take anything? Everything is ready. I'm all packed. Oh, that's good, that's good. That car... That car... why didn't it get here? It'd better get here. We're going to make it, aren't we? - We're going to make it, ha? - Yes, Nick, we will. You don't think your father tries anything, Do you? I think he'd be too scared of hurting me. He was wild when he left here. I know, but he won't. Bad enough, he's just bad enough... Just one... Don't move. Don't move, I tell you, don't move! Stop here! He told them. Somebody told the! You were going to kill me. No. I need you. That's right. She says he is hiding right in her house. All right, her apartment. Sure, he is armed. Look, look, we'll get it. Wait, wait a second.

What about the receipt? - Why shoul I lie to you? I'm telling the truth. - Where is the receipt? Maybe I can go phone and tell them I couldn't find it when I got here. How phone? I could go upstairs and call from the neighbours. Sure. That would be great. Leave me here alone, waiting for you while you go out and I would have to go looking for you, wouldn't I? I'll be back, Nick. You've always wanted me getting out of here, haven't you? Yes! Yes, ha? - No! - No? Which is it? Which is it? - Only because I... - Only because you got to rig for your family. That's not so. You went to the police, kept me waiting here for a car you didn't buy. - I did buy the car. - You're lying. They are waiting for me out there. Tell me they are waiting for me.
