We oppose theme park! Protect our market! Mokpo Central Market is Changing! We oppose theme park! Protect our market! KIM RAE-WON Who is the redevelopment for? The merchants oppose! WON JIN-AH That's more than enough! JIN SUN-GYU Move. The ruling's out, you can't do this. - Screw the ruling! - Move, move. - Who are you to mess with us? - Move out of the way. There's an order to demolish here! - Hey, what's up? - Now the goons... Get rid of them, we're busy. We got mixed up with communist bitches. Communist bitches? Say that again! Communist? Did I hear that right? You got balls saying that. - What else should I call you? - How dare you call me that?! Don't swear at the girls. This is a done deal, let's wrap it up nicely. Nicely how? We're protecting our rights. Who are you? You're not a native here. Don't interfere with local matters. I'm their lawyer. I should be telling you to not interfere. Get rid of hired goons! Get rid of hired goons! Goddammit! Get rid of hired goons! Who's the goon? Shit, you're the goons! Screw this protest, you're only here to get more money! We were hired legally to do this. All right, bulldoze them. Let's go! Get rid of them! Told you not to gring bats. Go! Do it! Are you serious?! What are you doing? Stop! Piss off! Legal? You know the law? I'm glad you mentioned it! Why do you think these people are doing?! If someone forces you out of your home, would you? Shame on you! So-hyun! Hee-su! Let her go! Stop it! I said stop! Move! What do you think you're doing?! Guys, stop! Stop! Out of the way! Back off, assholes! Get off of her! Back off! Move aside! Get back! Geun-bae! Stop! Stop! Stop! Pull out! Pull out for now! What the... Let's go. She's tough for a midget. - What did he call me? - What's wrong? You can't just leave! She wants us to go. It must be nice to be tall like a yeti! Don't ever come back, goons! Boss, what's wrong? Don't come back, assholes! Piss off! I'll mess you up! You got that?! LONG LIVE THE KING Boys, get up! 3 months later Morning, sir. Asshole, are you on a camping trip? - Have some bread. - Look, that goon is back. What difference will that make? I know, eh? Don't mind them. You really should eat a proper meal. You're all drinking first thing in the morning? I'm sorry, sir. You have to stay healthy. Have some milk. Eating bread won't do, order 30 meals for them. For them? Yes, boss. Clean up properly, hurry. Hey, hurry! Where's Jang? He's at the sauna. Were you at the protest? No, man. Go get me some orange juice. Right away, sir. I'm sick of this shit. The big boss doesn't give a shit about the business. After getting slapped, he fell for that bitch and he's been like that for 3 months! I'm sure he has a plan. What plan? It's killing me! Don't cross my lines! It'll get tangled! My apologies, boss. It's actually nice to fish. But why are we fishing at a spot like this? Killing two birds with one stone. Two birds, huh? What is it? Payment for yesterday's lunch. Don't ever do that again. Wait a minute. What did I do so wrong? Gangsters using violence, that's not wrong? What violence? We stood back for 3 months. You sure did, you quietly threatened us. I'd had it with this. Let's do it that way then. What way? You know! That. You're so clueless! Let's just do that. What? You can do anything? Yes. Really? That's right. Then be a human being. What are you talking about? Do I look like a ghost? Be a good person. A good person? What should I do then? Stop being a gangster and you'll meet a good girl. You keep calling us gangsters, but that's not us. We're doing a proper business. In any case, I'm done here. Wait... Okay! Don't take that back. Don't change your mind later. I'm gonna do everything you told me to do. Excuse me, do you not understand me at all? Why is she so angry all the time? I have a big announcement. I'm gonna get out of this biz, sell the club for me. What the dog shit are you saying? What's this about? Did something happen? I'm gonna go legit. What's a legit work? I won't do anymore shameful work. You're a real saint. You got boys to take care of. Whatever, I'm gonna be a good person from here on. Holy cow. Did that girl told you to? For you to be a good man? She must have bad standards. She doesn't notice this prince charming. Oh my... Try some of this, it's so fresh. - Is this from today? - It's really good. His crush will ruin everything. Turn on the TV. It's really good. Mokpo is the hottest race for Woori Democractic party's nomination. 2-term incumbent Congressman Choi Man-su is accused... That's Choi Man-su. Man-su again? He only lowers his head during election period! He's a thief like no other. Why aren't cops doing anything? Go arrest him! Why are you bringing us into this? Maybe you can't arrest him? There are rumors of other potential nominees, and Hwangbo Yoon is a top contender. Dude, if you want to be good, follow him around. He was a thug too. He's head of Mokpo Welfare... For real? He followed the president around and worked for him too. He's a really good man. But Congressman Choi is expected to win without much opposition. Mokpo Granny Diner Head back. Pardon? Sit over here. For one? Is there a menu? Nope. Family cooked meal - $1 It's only $1? Yes. Give me one, a bottle of soju too. No alcohol. 1 meal! I got soju, want a drink? Nice to meet you, this is Mokpo! Hey sweetie, take care! Jung Cheol-min's Social Jockey The court accepted injunction against illegal obstruction of demolition. Huh? To continue the protest, we must pay $500 a day. They want us to pay? $500 isn't some chump change! Shit, Choi Man-su must've flexed his muscles. They're all in league with each other. We can appeal it but the chances of reversing it is slim. But we'll find a way so don't worry too much. Okay. Hi! Hi, good day. So good to see you. Cheol-min, what brings you here? Good to see you. You got a taping here? Not really. Why did we come? Obviously, to crush Choi Man-su! Where's Mr. Hwangbo? Not leaving? Could you get Mr. Hwang!? I need to talk to him. What for? It's not a talk for a part-timer. But I'm not... Who is he? I don't know. Mr. Hwang? Yes? I, uh, got a favor to ask you. What favor? Let's sit down and talk. Mr. Hwangbo! Look who's... Eh? Hi! Family diner CEO! Why are you here? To eat, obviously. What about you? - You look so good. - Way too good. What brings you down here? I heard that you were running a restaurant, but how could you make any money selling $1 meals? You're too transparent. If you came to convince me, you better head back. June! Give them some food! Enjoy your meal, and go back. Mr. Hwang! Sir! Hey, why are you following him? Mr. Hwang! Can't we talk for a bit?! My last name is 'Hwangbo.' And I don't know what you're after, but there is an order to things, come by another time. I'm so tired. Don't put hot peppers. It's too spicy. I didn't put them in this time. Granny, I'm gonna throw these out, it's too old. Leave them, they're just fine! I'll get you new ones, I'm tossing this. Your mother? Stupid punk, my son is a hottie! What are you looking at? If you got nothing to do, go clean the toilet. Why should I? Didn't you say you got a favor to ask? So nasty... What the hell was that for?! Do it properly, stop pretending to do it. Jesus! It's shit... Dad! Dad! Take care! What is it? It's nothing. Photo op for Director Kang Ju-seok and Chairman Hwangbo Yoon. It's the golden ratio. So what's your favor? I heard you were a gangster back in the day. I want to switch careers like you. For what? You know... I'm getting older, I want to start anew. Did you commit a crime? It's nothing like that. I want to volunteer like you, and I want people to see me as a good man, you know! Sure. You want to clean your reputation. I'm opening myself up to you. I'm not like that! Excuse me! You know how to play cards? You know shit! They're smoking in the restaurant. Oh, right. Those bastards didn't move their asses at all. I'd thump their skulls in if I had it my way. Sir, you can't smoke in here. Who are you? A part-timer. I know plenty of muscle heads. My cousin is in a Gwangju gang, and my brother is a homicide cop... You're being cute because you know people? I'm jealous. So nice to know them. - Hands down. - Oh my god! - Look at that. - Be quiet and eat. - He's beating him up! - Just eat. What should I do? Put your hand down! What the hell?! You son of a bitch! There are still gangsters in Mokpo? Gwang-choon's boy, right? Did the Big Dong tell you to do this? Go, I've had it with you all. Dammit... Big Dong, my ass... - Shut the hell up! - Fucking bastard! - Are you okay? - Yes. Are you nuts?! Why did you do that?! I owe those bastards a lot of money! I was only trying to help... Forget it! It's not like you'll guard this place! You don't know how annoying those guys are! I'm done for! Wait, hey! You can't just leave. I'm talking here! Throwing your fist is instinctual, no? Lose the habit first. Hey! Do Rodeo Street merchants use Big Dong's money? Yeah, that's his turf. Talk to them and lend them our money without interest. Say what?! How much is that? Just do it. We're in the red. No way, we make a mint with the club. But you're giving away all the profit! Just do it, asshole! And I'm selling all our shops, so make it happen. Boss! Did that bitch order you to? Order me what?! It's my idea. It's not a bad idea. We need to improve ourselves too. You punk! We improved so much over the years! We sold off arcades and others, and the club's all we got! Who cares about us, what about Don So-pal? He's so old that he can't do anything else. What are you doing? Shut the hell up, I've made up my mind. The meat was good. Are you a robot? Do everything she asks? What about my habit? Se-chool! You gotta lose that temper of yours. You got me these bruises. It hurts so damn much. Whatever... Pacific Capital Fuck you, whatever man. What's taking them so long? What up? It's been a while. Why are you here? Came for some money. Still into gambling? Come on! I got out of that shit so long ago! Here. Blondie! Let's have lunch. Hurry up! Fucking bitches, let's go. Good morning! Time is money! Boss, coffee! Me too! You two, my office. Poker – Black Jack Blondie, what's with your face? I tripped. Tripped? Doing what? I was out drinking with the boys, he was there too. Chinese food? With Se-chool? If you're dumb, have some grit! If you got no grit, have the brain! If my only family member gets beaten up by my mortal enemy Se-chool, how would I feel? That fucker was calling you Big Dong, how could I hold back? Lean over. This is an educational bat for others, but it's a love bat for you. We may come from different wombs but we're brothers. Pitch. Say it after me. - Jang Se-chool! - Jang Se-chool! - Motherfucker! - Motherfucker! - Fuck Jang Se-chool! - Fuck him! - Kill him! - Kill him! - Got it?! - Got it! By accelerating beautiful Mokpo's tourism development, I'll bring in 10 million tourists! Every piece of encouragement from the citizens of Mokpo keeps me going. Choi Man-su, candidate #1! For advancement of Mokpo, I'll gladly give my life! I look so old there. Congrats! 3rd term! 3rd term! Congrats! Jung Cheol-min's in town. Jung Cheol-min? Who's that? Yeah, he's known as 'Social Jockey, ' he's a satirical podcaster. His show is #1, I think. They're so funny! Those guys chew me up, nothing but yap, yap, yap. Then why are they here? I think he's trying to lure Hwangbo to enter the race. Those dirty bastards. Sons of bitches. It's all right. Does Hwangbo have a party? He's nothing. Hwangbo Yoon? 1,000 of him are no match for me! By the way, what'll you do with that? The merchant protest's stalling it. The court made a decision. You're the best! Dammit! I shoveled money to the judges trying to get this done! The merchants stopped you from bulldozing the place? Well... I sent some subcontractors, and they aren't doing shit! My hands are tied because he's a powerful gangster. You've got no balls for someone in construction business. My poor theme park friends. Man-su, Choi Man-su. We just gotta do our part, no? Here! Congressman Choi! Let's go to the park! Let's turn our life around! Let's go! Go! You can't do this, we have to come together! I know! I don't believe this. - Welcome, sir. - So-hyun! Good evening. Sir, have you talked to other merchants? It's all over. 2 merchants settled. The fine scared them off, it's just too much. The law is useless, it always sides with the rich. I'm sorry. It's okay, you did all you could. I'll meet the mayor myself. He won't want to meet. We tried to make contact several times but nothing. That's why we need you in the congress. Only a powerful man can change things. Mr. Hwangbo, please enter the race. He's right, don't be stubborn and enter the race. Save us, please? Enter the race! Please do it. We can't let Choi Man-su have it his way anymore! Mr. Hwangbo! Please sit down. Sir. I know why you're hesitating. I know you're sick of the politics too. But we can't sit here and watch them get demolished. You must stand up and be the voice of Mokpo people. Yes, for the citizens, please? I'm Jung Cheol-min and this is the Social Jockey. And I'm Dr. Lee. - We're in Mokpo. - Mokpo's very nice. Very good. I drove about 4.5 hours, all by myself nonstop. I was more tired in the passenger seat. Then you drive. - We got a special guest! - Super special. He lived a dramatic life. It's like a film. A gangster went to work for the president. Nice! - Mokpo's tiger. - Tiger! - Hwangbo! - Yoon! He's the head of Mokpo Welfare Foundation! There are dozens articles on Hwangbo's announcement. Good morning! I quickly ran a simulation last night, we lost the election. Hwangbo has a lot of supporters in the 30-40 group. Buddy! Does this make sense?! Jung's been tearing up the Mokpo theme park, we're getting pummeled by the media. I better rip that yapping bastard's mouth or something! Judging from an objective analysis, you should delay the Central Market demolition until after the election. If I can delay it, I would have. If that idiot Kim didn't waste our damn time, I'd have! I poured so much money into that. But if Hwangbo uses it as a leverage, we'll be in a disadvantage. The prosecution has started investigating the bank loan case. We can bury that. Only if you win the election! How dare you! I'm sorry, sir. Get out. So you're feeling shaky in this election? Why is that shitface Hwangbo entering the race? He's got no shame. You know about the market demolition and the 50-story building? Sure. The merchants are protesting and causing stink. Bitching and moaning won't stop progress. It'll go up. I'll give you the sky lounge. For real? You're coming on too hard. You had it tough up to this point. It's your time to live comfortably. So what do I have to do this time? Yeah, yeah. It's like this. How dare it crawl out? It must know its place. What'll happen to this country if dogs and cats get into politics? Fine. I'll wipe your throne clean, keep your promise about the sky lounge. Let's drink. - Is Mr. Hwangbo in? - Nope. - Give me some food. - We're closed. - There's no announcement. - He's at another diner? I'll see you then, okay. Who is he? Gangster. Hey. Good to see you. Aren't you two too close? Why do you keep showing up? This isn't about you. I... I thought it over, now I understand. I'm trying to change, go easy on me. Stop your nonsense and get out of here. I'm apologizing, can't you see? Sir! I don't know what you're up to, but you should go today. I'm not leaving, I can't. Sir, the thing about me is, once I make up my mind, I go to the end of the earth for it! I'm never giving up so take me in! I'm never gonna move. I'm a rock from now on, I'm not moving. Eat. He really doesn't get it. You're a man. You sure are. Now that I'm in, I feel heavy burden. But you confirmed it. The only person who can face Choi is you. When will you get into politics? Me? Don't joke... I'll back you up, so do your best. Ho-tae says I'm like a robot... That bastard... Why? Why did he call you that? Whenever I see So-hyun... That's that... He's been talking about that for an hour like that. Are you two dating? No! Why should I... It's all him! I don't know. What's with you? Why do you not like him, give me a reason. Is it because of your ex... Stop! Are you nuts?! This guy's so much more romantic... And cute. He's a good man. He's the goon who's trying to crush us. For 3 months. That's called a shield. He stopped others from stepping in! Yeah, he acted as a barricade. Mister, you did that? Yeah, karaoke! Gangster robot, wake up. - You wanna go to karaoke. - Screw that, go home! - Go? - Go? Go! - Go? - Go? - Go! Go! Go! - Go! Go! Go! Let's go to karaoke! - Gangster robot, get up! - Yo, get up. Let's just go home. Please! Stop! Sing! Sing! Sing! What? What's wrong? ♪ The day that I said I love ♪ ♪ you for the first time ♪ Why is a gangster singing a classic pop? Not country? ♪ ...came off lightly like a joke ♪ He looks so cool, though. ♪ Did you not understand, ♪ ♪ or were you just pretending? ♪ ♪ I felt awkward as you laughed at me... ♪ Yes, Mr. Hwangbo? No, we are almost finished. Okay, will do so. You were up? Finally awake? Have some breakfast. Do you remember last night? Yeah, I wasn't completely out of it. You also remember what you said about starting over from the bottom? I understand what you mean now. I'm not a fighter anymore. Can you take responsibility for your words? I'll promise you. If I don't, I'll break my wrist. You sound like an idiot. I'm just saying that's my will. But it's not an empty promise, I'll do everything you ask. I was eating that. 6-star hotel and convention center right here! That's so sexy. Completion date? August, 2021. That's a long time. Eh? Isn't that Hwangbo Yoon? Where? Se-chool's there too, what the fuck is he doing? He looks like Hwangbo's minion. Should we do something? I'm moving up to the sky lounge I'm gonna wipe all my competition out. Fuck them. Was this on credit? It's donation. But they don't even have enough to spare. Even when the world turns cruel, we all help each other. Donation isn't just for when you have enough. Everyone helped out ever since granny started out. - Good morning. - Good to see you. What's he doing here? - Everything okay? - Yes... What'll happen to the diner now that you're running? He'll take over from now. - What? - Yes. - What? - Seriously? All right. Thank you! Bye. Pour sesame oil and lightly stir fry it. Easy, right? Is this thick enough? No, it's gotta be thinner. - It's gotta be thick for the soup. - That's why it's gotta be thin! s It's all the same once it's inside the mouth. This? Put little bit in. Oops! Holy cow! It's good! No more onion. Okay. Have a great meal. I'll bring you some more. Good day, ladies and gents! I'm Peace Party's, Kang Hee-gook! Are your meal hot and great? Who is he? A migrant bird named Kang, who jumps between parties. Allow me to give you a bow! Thank you! I need 2 soups! Ho-tae, how much longer? Yes, boss! Oh shit! - Stupid idiot. - How could you spill it! Fuck, I'm done with this, no, I can't do this. We're in 1st place, but we still need to be on our toes. They got a lot of swing votes and compared to them, we got no infrastructure, no power and no money. We got nothing, so... I thought I was gonna die, there's so much work to do. You said you'd come up from the bottom. Give it up if you're tired. I'm just saying. I'll take care of the diner, so make sure to get him elected. I'm off. Report to work by 8. Not by your car, take the bus. Good luck! Why did he come? What's next? Turn to page 3, and you'll see... Bud. This goes to Manho district, right? Um, yes... Didn't we meet somewhere before? You? I don't know. You look familiar. Stay in school. Okay. What in the world? Help! Please help! Help! Do something! Please! Get up! Get out! Where are you going? Sir! Sir! Come on out! Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't move! Stop! Hold still! Don't move! Stay right there! Hey! Wake up! Out! Get out! Get out! Out! Hurry! Hurry! Come on! Go! Now! Please hurry! Hurry! Go! Hurry! No! Mister! A disaster struck at 8 AM this morning, a bus fell into the ocean from Northern side of Mokpo Bridge. 10 passengers suffered serious injuries, we'll talk to one of the passengers. What happened when the bus was hanging on the guardrail? - Morning. - There was this guy... - Look at that. - He was so brave. What is it? - An accident on Mokpo bridge. - Everyone was running for their lives. - Yeah? Today? - Yup. But he rushed us out and went for the driver... Oh, now I remember him. It's the gangster! I was working at a restaurant... - then he came to my rescue. - Why is he there? He was like Superman! So what happened to him? Well, what happened was... he fell into the ocean with the bus... It's a chaotic situation, I hope he's rescued quickly. Where are you going?! Hey! So-hyun! June, I'm late. What happened? It's nothing at all. Did something happen? Let's eat, does your dad have any extra clothes? Okay, I'll look for some. I can't believe I'm alive... Very nice. But why the fire sale? I'm about to go insane, don't ask me that. You're practically getting it for free. One second. So nice! This is Palryong Corporation. What? Where? TV station? What's going on here? Hold on. - What time should we start? - Give us a minute. Boss, change into this. - Did you call them? - Yes, boss. This is a bit awkward for us. It's not good for us to get our faces on TV. I know. Nonsense, this is an opportunity. Boss, wear this and look good to your girl. You conniving prick. Over here! - What is it? - Go on inside. Why didn't you flee like everyone else? The driver was unconscious. - Could you elaborate? - Excuse me. His side of the bus was leaning over, I tried to pull him out but couldn't. Weren't you scared? You were about to fall. It was chaotic, it was very pressing moment. I couldn't just abandon him to save myself. What does it feel like to become the hero of Mokpo? We have to open this diner, there are people lining up outside, thank you all for coming. Thank you too. Hwangbo's popularity is no joke. I know. The so-called hero of Mokpo who rescued the bus driver, is apparently with Hwangbo too. He's a hottie. Did you look for dirt on Hwangbo? Yes, I'm looking for even a parking ticket but... If there isn't, make some up. That's election. Objectively, we can't rely on negative publicity alone. 12% lead surpasses the margin of error by a mile. Shit, what if we all get fucked? The election has not even begun, don't be so hard on yourself. Yes, she's right. Congressman. Should I bribe Hwangbo? Give him some shares? Wow, what a life, sail on a yacht, eh? Why am I here? Is it going well? What is? Do you not want me to go to congress? That's all in the timing! Look at this punk. Not in front of my boys. What a pussy, go on, hit me. Go on, it's okay, hit me. Make up your mind! Shit or get off the pot! Goddamn thugs! If I treat you like humans! You think you're almighty! Goddammit! Do what you do best! Don't waste your talent. If you're gonna do it, you better get on it. Let go. That bastard still thinks he's a prosecutor. Status on Gwangju boys? They'll be here tomorrow. Get them to come fast, there's no time. Yes, sir. It's this morning's Gallup poll. We're at 47.2%, Choi at 33.4%. That's 14% difference. It's beyond margin of error. The civil servants are cozying up to us. We can't relax yet. There's 33% swing votes, we gotta take them. Then why don't we use the bus hero during campaign? His video had over 2 million views. Good, everyone in Mokpo saw that. Right? - It's not a bad idea. - Right? I oppose. Why? Why do you oppose? It's not right to use someone who has nothing to do with politics. It's not right to make decisions based on personal feelings. Let's look into it, okay? Rescued 10 minutes after the accident I'm gonna go deaf. You savage, even the geezers gotta sleep at night. It's almost done. Why are you doing that in the middle of the night? Because the water's blocked. What exactly do you do? I work at your restaurant. Why? Are you interested in my restaurant? Are you gonna run it? Looks like I got some talent, people like my food. Bullshit. I gotta go to the hardware store, wait up for me. Dang, why was it in there? Call me if there's a problem. I'll come fix it. Sure. - It's still quite chilly. - I know. Granny, we're here! Hey. You were resting? - I brought new blankets. - Why the hell for? Was someone here? Isn't it obvious? It's that savage. - Se-chool? - Yeah. He was hammering that thing, I thought I was gonna go deaf. Where did he go? He was messing shit up, and he went out for a bit. Scoot over, man! I'm so hot. This isn't a small car. How much do you weigh? Just over 180 kg. - You? - 140 kg. I'm the skinniest one here, boss. We're not a wrestling agency, why get these fat asses? I didn't arrange it, Sung-cheol did. That fucking asshole. Even if Hwangbo is strong, he can't take on all 3 of us. Yeah, you could wrestle him to death. Lift your asses, you'll burst the tires! It's so tight because of you. - Scoot over a little. - Don't move, man! Be quick and disappear. Mess it up then you're all going to the Philippines. Which way is front? Where are the holes? Jesus! You think you can get out?! Be careful! Don't stab each other! Go wait in the car. - Sir... - It's okay, go on. Give me your money. Fucking hell... Come on! Hello? Is this the police? There's a robbery! We're being robbed! There, go get her. So annoying... We're at... Give me your phone! Let go of me, asshole! Stab him! Go on! Stab him! Jesus... Give it! Give it! Let go! Sir! Sons of bitches! Go stop him, you bastards! Hey! Sir, are you okay?! Oh no! Over here! Is anyone there? Mr. Hwangbo! Hold on! This is absolutely nuts! How many were there? When is the doctor coming by? There were 5. It's an all-out assault! So-hyun. You're not doing so hot, you should go get some rest. I'm fine, are you okay? I got some pain relief patches. - Good morning. - Hello there. Christ! Mr. Hwangbo! How did this happen?! How could something like this happen in Mokpo! I stopped by at the police station, and told them to do their jobs, so they'll be caught soon. Where did they stab you? - Congressman! - Be careful! - Your schedule is... - Yeah? Mr. Hwangbo, you have to take it easy. Don't you worry. Take good care of him, okay? - Okay. - Good. This way. Take care of him. Stay strong. Stay strong! You should leave. We'll stay strong just fine. How could this happen? This way, sir. - Here's a fruit basket. - We'll have a feast. There's no security cameras and it was too dark. Se-chool, you okay? We'll investigate this right, so don't worry. - I'm off. - Bye. Don't act on this. Whatever. I wonder if we should leave it all to the cops. Are there still robbers in Mokpo? So-hyun says they were after him from the start. Oh gosh... Then wouldn't he have ordered it? Come on, even so... It's Choi Man-su, he fights dirty and he's behind the race too. Then it could be Big Dong's boys. He does Choi's dirty work for his elections. Good morning! Good morning, sir. - Time is! - Money... What is it? You have... a guest... - Who is it? - Well... What the... What's up? Is this why Choi is getting rid of the merchants? I don't know. That came with the frame. Did he promise you a cut if you kill Mr. Hwangbo? You're being creative. That's a national treasure, leave that. Boss, Se-chool is... Shit, but where could the piglets be? What do you mean? Tell Choi, I'm not holding back. Tell him yourself! We don't get in bed with politicians. Asshole... Piglets? They should be on an airplane now. You should get some sleep. We'll handle things here. Look into 3 fatsos under Big Dong, all were over 100 kg. I don't think they got any fat muscles. They could've been mercs! Get in touch with Brown Bear in Gwangju. Right away. Holy hell, how're you feeling? It's just a mosquito bite. So you continued running the shop? Yeah. How do you liking it? It's better now that I'm used to it. Can you continue to run it? Nothing I can't do. I'll take over the shop for a while, so don't worry. That's that, I know this is weird timing... What is it? I made a promise... Gonna smash your wrist? Are you nuts? It's a man's promise. You still don't get it. I do. You told me to lose the habit, and I tried to keep the promise, but I got worked up seeing you get stabbed. Then do it. Put your hand here. Do it in one hit. So it won't be extra painful. Go outside, go on. Why? Why should I? Give it a go. You can't do it? Should I do it? Get ready! Go on. Let's just drop it. Is this fun? Mr. Hwangbo. We've been talking amongst ourselves. I want you to enter... the race instead of me. What? What are you saying? Don't be a weakling, you'll recover soon. Doctor said he needs to rest for a month, so in his state... You're the only alternative now. These two will help you. And promise me one thing. Just like what you did in the bus, protect the citizens of Mokpo, keep your promise like you do now. Mokpo needs someone like you, not Choi Man-su. No, politics is completely different than our world! Never! Why are you always negative? Take my advice as someone who lived longer than you. Politics is a shit hole, it's not for human beings! Dude. We're family, right? Of course. If my family don't want me to, I won't do it. Jeez, you're putting me on the spot! Come up slowly. Jeez, come on... Why are you in politics? Having worked in the world of law, it is not always fair to everyone. And it's slow to adapt. I wanted to change these things. I don't know if I'm qualified. What do you think? I opposed the idea. But Mr. Hwangbo thought highly of your drive. Not looking back after making a decision. You get criticized whether you do good or bad. That's politics. Candidates for the April election have finally begun their campaigns. They're focusing on streets and intersection with high traffic, and installed banners with candidates' faces. Central leadership of Woori Party gathered to combined their forces, and Peace Party pleaded for support. Incumbent Congressman Choi Man-su pushed to promote tourism with construction of Mokpo Aquatic Theme Park... People's Social Party's Noh believed in the power of laborers, and resolution of polarization as her most important work. Due to an unforeseen event, Hwangbo Yoon dropped out, and Mokpo's so-called hero Jang Se-chool took over, and will be running as an independent. Merchants of Central Market, everyone, good morning. I'm candidate #5, Jang Se-chool. - He at least look the part. - I came here to say... the theme park that's trying to push you all out! No one here wants that! Am I right?! Hey! Stop! Who's getting rich on whose authority?! - No one wants that! - Kids! Don't play with that. So what can we do? What's next? I told him to be natural, why is he struggling? I... Then why don't you give him some pointers? Damn... Sir! Thank you so much for coming. So happy to see you. Choi is not right for the job, but so is that hooligan. Mr. Hwangbo's supporting him, please go easy on him. He stands no chance to win he's third in the race. I know, you gotta support Kang, who at least has a chance. Ma'am, you know Kang isn't fit to serve Mokpo. I admit that he became popular because of the bus incident. Forget it, let's go. Forget what? Hear me out! - I'm not making empty promises. - That's a stereotype. I keep my word, thank you. Job creation! Eliminate youth unemployment! Stale economy of Mokpo! I'll bring it back! For all! Choi Man-su! Choi Man-su! Politics for citizens! Powerful politics! Candidate #1 Choi Man-su! He's a snake. Fuck the hero shit. Mokpo's Hero Will Get it Done! Will you guys vote? I've never done it before. I don't do shit like that. I don't either. The race is over even before it begins. I'll slap your fucking face. Come on, let's go. Ms. Kang? Good afternoon, madame. Mr. Jang is quite impressive. He captured 15% as soon as he entered. I only managed to get 3% after all my work. It's all thanks to Mr. Hwangbo. That's not always the case, it's a new world. He's a club owner? He sold it off. Remember Mr. Hwangbo's diner? He's in charge of it now. Was this all planned out? He was never interested in running. We really didn't plan this. Have some. Ms. Kang, did you come here to ask me for a favor? - Have plenty. - Sure. It's good. Mr. Jang. This is candidate Mrs. Noh. I know who it is. - Good to meet you. - Good evening. Fish cake looks delicious. So? Does campaigning suit you? Yes, I'm doing my best. Of course you should, that's bare minimum. I heard you sold the club. Will you be all right? Election is no joke. Sure, I only want to do proper work. Proper? What kind? When I win, I'll only work for people of Mokpo. You think you'll win? You think it's too easy. What the hell do you mean? We've never lost a fight. I see... Mr. Hwangbo said to me once, "Go for people." Is that so? What does it mean? You know, those without power. I must make sure they're not wronged. I never thought I'd hear those words from a man who used violence. I've had it! Don't. You're right. I was quite stupid in the past. I'm still new at this, please help me, madame. Liver and lung are delicious here. Manila, Philippines Instant noodle again? We got no money! Why aren't they sending us money? How many did you cook? - 5. - Gonna eat alone? You gotta cook 10. We only got 5! Then go buy some! You know how to eat but not how to cook?! It's so damn hot... Look at this pig in heat. Who is it? You gotta use English. You know shit. How are you? Hey there, good to see you. So you're the 3 piglets hiding out? Who are you? He's the legendary Brown Bear, be respectful. Why are you holding bananas? Put them down. You're eating instant noodles out here in the Philippines? So heartbreaking. Wow, it's dead here. Everyone bailed because one person changed? Choi 38%, Kang 17%, we're at 15%. We're 20 points behind Choi, we have to catch up. We gotta do something. Se-chool was king of the nightlife! What? Yeah, we hired so many people when we were in business! Waiters, bouncers, drivers! - Regulars. - Regulars! I think we can bring in about 300 people. No way, with their families, it'll be about 1,000. What? What? Nothing. Yeah? Boss, we got the piglets. Good work. Bring them safely. Of course. Geun-bae got the piglets, when they return, send them to the cops. Sure thing. What piglets? Geun-bae did his part. Someone caught something? We tracked down the guys who stabbed Mr. Hwangbo, and they were in the Philippines. So he sent Geun-bae after them. They were Gwangju boys. We're not the slack off type. Gwangju? Who ordered them? We don't know yet. We'll know soon. He has not slept more than 3 hours since entering the race. What is it? He wrote a speech. It's good. Fresh fish today. Se-chool! - It's been a while. - Hey. Great work everyone! Hey there! Mother. I should've come earlier, I'm sorry about that. I somehow ended up running for office, and I knew I had to come see you. "Mother"? Why am I your mother?! I'm busy, just leave me. Why are you still standing there?! - Mom, what's with you? - Don't touch me! Don't. Good evening! Thank you! Candidate #4, Noh Gap-soon, please vote for us! Noh Gap-soon! Please forgive me, mother. Oh hell! Election or not, don't ever come back here! Whenever you call me mother, my stomach turns. - Noh Gap-soon! Noh Gap-soon! - Candidate #4! Vote for Noh Gap-soon! Dude, get up. - Take care of her. - Sure. Choon-taek! It's your mom's birthday, you should head home. Screw you, you go. Choon-taek, let's go. Run! Get out of here! Choon-taek! Choon-taek! Buddy! For Congressman Choi's third term! Third term! - Congressman! - Prosecutor Park! I brought a junior from Mokpo office, say hello. - Good evening. - So good to meet you. Take good care of us when you get elected. Of course! You gotta start climbing the ladder, no? I'll put in a good word to Seoul Prosecution Office. I'm forever loyal to you, sir! You hired dumbass fucks?! I don't believe this. The piglets can't do jackshit, only to get snapped up in the Philippines. Come here, stand. What a hassle. Shining brightly for Mokpo's economy! Choi Man-su! Mokpo's greatest worker, Choi Man-su! Pacific's Mr. Jo? Come here. He answered. Yes, hello? This is Choi Man-su. I thought you were God. I didn't think you'd ever answer. He is the best! He is the best! Pacific's Mr. Jo He is the best! The best! Candidate #1! Choi Man-su! Yesterday and today... I told you not to call me. It's a state of emergency, I gotta consult my co-conspirator. What emergency? They got our balls. They're gonna find out Choi Man-su tried to assassinate Hwangbo. What's this bullshit you speak of? You acted out on your own. You're hurting my feelings. I acted out on your order. The boys we sent abroad got into trouble. I'll try to resolve that, but don't you dare try to cut me off. I won't go down by myself, you got that? Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Jo. Don't forget what I have on you. That shit again? You used me for 12 years with that. Jo Gwang-choon, you son of a bitch. Statute of limitation for murder is 15 years. There's still 3 more years. We'll chat tomorrow, so get my money ready. I'm gonna do it my way, do whatever you want. Trying to shackle me? So the cops know? Um, it was hard to check... Yes... Dude, what will you do? Point of no return. How are you feeling? I'm just scratched up. There's nothing to see there. It hurts over here. Jang is a lot different than I thought. Why? You disappointed? Of course not, you chose him. I dug into him, he has Robin Hood tendencies. Pardon? He paid off bar girls' debts and donated a lot too. He's known to do unconventional things. He's a character. Look who's talking. This election's quite tough. Thank you for everything today. Great work, everyone. We start at 7 AM, Stockfish market. - Okay, see you tomorrow. - Be early. Why are you looking at me? - You like me or something? - In your dreams. Good evening everyone. What brings you... I came to say something. Yes, ma'am. What you said about going for people, I hope that's true. I may only be 3%, but let's do our best! She has decided to unite our parties. Madame! Please be a politician who truly works for the people. Accept her. Thank you! I'll do this with everything I got. Let's make a miracle together! Thank you for believing in me. - Thank you! - I'll do my best. Ms. Obedient and the gangster are joining forces? Yes. There'll be an official announcement this morning. That won't even make a dent. We should still make some preparations. They're rising up rapidly, and there's only about 10% difference. Political expert Han Man-sub. - What the hell are you? - Pardon? Always with this objective shit, objectively, what do you even do? I make analysis so that you... Fuck that, asshole! Is politics done by analysis? Politics is about grit! Live and die by grit! You son of a bitch! Man-sub, man. Who do you think stabbed Hwangbo? I keep thinking that it was Jang. He got greedy because of his popularity! He wanted to be a politician, so with a knife... Even so, Hwangbo supports him... That's why! So naïve! How did you ever earn your doctorate degree in political science?! He wouldn't have done it himself, he ordered it, who? Gangsters. Gangsters? There's a Mokpo gangster named Jo Gwang-choon, he wants to talk about Jang, go meet him. Who are you? Han Man-sub. Who's Han Man-sub? I'm Congressman Choi's political adviser. Where's the congressman? He's quite busy, you can talk to me. Goddammit... All right, so here's the plan. When they land, it's all over. So we'll take action before then. What action... That bastard Jang has a critical weakness too, I'll use it to make a deal with him. Then the congressman can serve third term. Don't frown. I'm not frowning. Okay. But aren't they Jang's men? Jang ordered it, to get rid of Hwangbo. That's what the congressman said? Yes, and that Jang ordered you, and the congressman wants you to turn yourself in. Turn myself in? Yes. With Jang Se-chool? Is that shit coming out of your mouth?! Get out of there! You son of a bitch! Get out! Ow! Ouch! Bastard... You fucker! Stop! Don't move, don't move. All right, you bastard, Let me go. Let me go first. Here you go. I did. This stupid bastard. Hey! Hey! Listen carefully. They're landing tomorrow, so tell the congressman. Call me before lunch. If not, we all better order our coffins. Understand, you fuck?! Upstanding citizens of Mokpo! I am Jang Se-chool! I will run for you! I will live for Mokpo! Vote for me! Thank you! - Hasn't started yet? - No, no! This is an incredible tip! Understood! It was tough getting it, so tell the congressman! Okay! This is going to be fun. You sure? It's not about sure or not, this is the only way. Okay, do it. My neck is on the line too, so pay me first. Do it first, money after the election. Dammit. This was him? Wow, small world. This is a gift from heaven, so that I can be elected. Hello, 240,000 citizens of Mokpo. I'm Woori Democratic Party's Choi Man-su. Before announcing my policies, I'd like to tell you an interesting story. I came upon this information, 12 years ago, there was an incident in front of a bank in Mokwon district. There was a gang war between 2 rival gangs, and a lieutenant of a gang was stabbed to death. A man, who is closely tied to this case, is running for office, right here in Mokpo. This is Jung Cheol-min's Social Jockey. Dr. Lee here. We got an unbelievable tip. It's huge. - It's a big news. - It is indeed. Do it. You might all be curious about what it is. Yes. What's going on with the Hwangbo Yoon assault case? There's no security footages, not a damn thing. - Not a thing. - It's a messed up case. But there is a report that the assaulters have been caught! We got the tip! To us! We're better than cops! We stop for no one. - We just go. - For sure! - Eyes forward. - Certainly. We always want the truth... Jang Se-chool is tied to murder case We always want the truth... Jang Se-chool is tied to murder case For sure. Where are the perpetrators? - In the Philippines. - Yeah, the Philippines. They're on the way to Korea. Yes... So what happens... Son of Mokpo, Jang Se-chool. Thank you, vote for me. Thank you. What's going on? We need to talk. I'm Jang Se-chool! What is it? What's this? Why didn't you mention something so important? Don't worry, I can fix this. How will you fix it? You think election is a joke? It's not that, this is awkward... I bet you went through it all, you were the king of nightlife. So-hyun... Gwang-choon ordered us. We just followed his order... Who ordered Gwang-choon? I don't know that. Jung Cheol-min got to it first. People online are accusing you of attacking Hwangbo. I think the police opened the investigation. You should shut Jo Gwang-choon up quickly. Yes, councilor. I'm in a meeting at the moment, I'll call you right back. Hey. Where is that gangster now? What the hell is going on? He didn't do anything wrong, don't worry about that. It's all in the past, he wasn't implicated. Mr. Jang! I'm from JN Daily, could we have an interview? No! Wait! He's running for public office, we must know the truth! I know, we're not quite ready. Let's do it. He wants to do it! - Let's do it. - Let go of me. I'm a JD Daily reporter. How are you connected to the case 12 years ago? People wouldn't like it if the Mokpo hero was a gangster. I'll take full responsibility for what I've done. So you're owning up to it? Why are you running? Wanting to represent Mokpo, I entered the race to do good work for the people of this city. For the people? Did you say you're doing this for the people? Do you know what people worry the most? When a gangster becomes a congressman, there's a distrust that you'll steal them blind! The only way to solve this is to be honest! But I can't just spill my guts. Why not?! Even if you couldn't tell others, you should've at least told me! I thought you were at least that kind of a man. Maybe I was wrong? Have I mistaken you? I'm doing this for one person. I met someone and this person changed my life. Who is that? - We'll end it here. - Could you tell us who? Just tell us who it is! Se-chool, good job. You did good. How could he ask you that? There's no one more pure than us! - Sure, we did so much... - It's So-hyun. So-hyun, huh? Mr. Jang, are you busy? So why did you have to change your occupation? The piglets you found, return them to us. Or she dies! If you even touch her hair, I'll fucking kill you! Say what? You bastard, if you don't, I'll sell her guts at the market! How dare you try to threaten a knife wielder! Let's just call the police. There's no time. What about the election?! We came so far! I won't give up, so don't hold me back. Oh my! Mr. Jang! What a coincidence! Is Mr. Hwangbo doing well? Come on, it wasn't me. I don't believe this. People of Mokpo! Someone has spread a strange rumor! I feel so victimized that I can't hold it in any longer! A 2-term incumbent Congressman Choi Man-su! Hires gangsters? And said to have attacked respected Mr. Hwangbo Yoon! Does this make sense?! Does it?! - That's enough. - What? That's enough. Enough of what? Enough hearing about Gwang-choon popping your girlfriend's cherry? What are you doing? Congressman! Call an ambulance! Someone call 911! A gangster just attacked me! Why did you hit him?! That's not fair! Choi Man-su! Choi Man-su! This is nuts... Why did you do that? We're almost caught up! That bastard started it! Do I not know that?! Let's drop this, okay? Jang's in a tough spot. Politics is done with brain, not muscles, don't you get it?! Boss. Turn the lights on. I think they ran. Call Geun-bae. Okay. Incheon International Airport What did you say? It's the boss' decision, let the piglets go. I worked my ass off to get them. I'll explain later, just do what I say! - Get back here ASAP. - Okay. First of all, I'd like to apologize. I should only be showing the people of Mokpo the healthy side of me. Will you press charges against Jang Se-chool for assault? No, no. I don't think he's a bad man. I hope you all do not hate Mr. Jang for this... - That'll be all for today. - Please leave the room. - He needs his rest. - Let's leave him alone. - Thank you all for coming. - Thank you! Take good care of them. This neck brace is starting to really hurt my neck. So you were in charge of the case from 12 years ago? Do you even need to ask? Let's bury him for good. Are you guys on a picnic or what? Son of a bitch! You bastard! Son of a bitch! Fucker! You son of a bitch... What the fuck! Run! Man-su? This bastard's not answering. Motherfucker! I'm gonna kill him. Come on, stop! Goddammit... What will you do?! I'm gonna go stab Choi, move out of the way! Then what?! You wanna go to jail?! You'll only be helping Jang! God-fucking-damn! Shit! It's all over if you're arrested. If anyone's gonna kill him, it'll be me, so you take it easy. Killing him doesn't even work! I'll leave the knife in the bag. What have I done? Goddammit... So cold. By the way, will you skip town? I'll come back when this blows over. Don't ever tell anyone. I won't even tell my dead mom. You can tell her. Just not the living ones. Go on. Watch out for yourself. Don't skip meals. Blondie. Come here. You're the only one who worries about me. Here! I didn't say that for money, I'm off. Boss! I got everyone to scour all docks. But what if he used another method? He'll use a boat. He knows the roads are littered with security cameras. He must be trying to go dark. You think he left his men behind and fled by himself? His half-brother is into gambling, right? Blondie? He goes nuts for it. Mr. Jang Yes, Mr. Jang. Have you seen Blondie? Blondie? He's here. Too bad for you, I got an ace. Goddammit! I hope you win today. Good to see you, sir. Boss, Geun-bae's here. Hey man, it's been a while. Blondie? Perfect timing, he went all-in. Boy. I told you to stop several times, didn't I? Take this and go home. Were they pros? You've been with us for how many years now? You know I took a guy's wrist for trying to game us. Dammit! They haven't left yet? They can't leave, there's more games to play. Lend me $50,000. - I'll pay you back right away. - How can I trust you? You know my brother, if I'm in debt, he'll help. Gwang-choon? Where is he now? I can't tell you that, so don't ask me! Cops are coming, let's move out! Did you get the cameras? Boss. Sign it. Fuck my organs! I'll pay you back! Jeez, stop hitting me, you fucking gorilla. Shit! A kidney isn't enough for $50,000. My brother's got money! He better, or you'll be in shit. Dammit... Good work everyone, see you in Kunsan! Yes, boss! Let's move. Who called the cops? I'm sorry, boss. Don So-pal was worried quite a bit. Boss, I shouldn't say this but... the election is coming up... I know, shut up. Gwang-choon's not holding anything back. What did I tell you, we're going to arrest him, so don't let Jang get involved, that'll be bad. Of course! I brought you in not to capture Gwang-choon, but to save him. Oh my, is this a cruise? It's so long. Get off already! Dammit! Se-chool, you got 1 day till the election! We'll get him so don't get involved! You got it? Hey! That bastard... I'll go in by myself, so wait here. You can't just do that. Let go! Swallow. What the hell is this? Just in case you run off, it's got a tracking chip, it won't harm you, so don't worry. Ow! I got you here, you can go in. Piss off, asshole. No need to frown. It's really got a chip? It's a vitamin. He worked hard to lose all his money. Hey! Bro! Gwang-choon! - What is it? - It's me! Who are you? Anyone here? - What did he say? - I don't know. Ms. Kang! - Engine room! - Ms. Kang! Where's Gwang-choon? I don't see him. He's not here. Fuck! Sons of bitches! You bastard! Give me the key. We're police, you see? - Is this his? - It is. Where is Gwang-choon?! I don't fucking know! Tell me! Hi! What the hell?! So-hyun! So-hyun! That fucking bitch! So-hyun! I told you not to touch her. I'm so sick of this shit! Se-chool... - Boss! - Sir! - Boss! - Where are you?! Over here, here! I should've killed you instead of Choon-taek. Get up, asshole! - Boss! - Sir! You fucking bastard! There's no way a gangster will become a politician! Hit me, fucking gangster! Go on, kill me, asshole! Fucking bitch! What the fuck?! Cops are useless fucks! Fucking bitch-ass bitches! Let's go! You think I'm a fish dick?! Fuck faces! Piss off! I'm late. I'm sorry. Hwangbo assault case suspect in custody Same suspect as bank murder case from 12 years ago Jo Gwang-choon... is prime suspect Jang Se-chool, free of suspicion Even though it wasn't his fault, he tortured himself for it. So the real gangster was Choi... Choi's connection to gang suspected Choi's suspicion rises Under 5% margin of error Close race Less than 5% difference Park, it really wasn't me! Am I nuts? Why'd I order something like that? Jo Gwang-choon acted out hastily. The thing is... - The evidence... - Come on, what about the evidence? A recording of you... talking to him on the phone was submitted by him! That hooligan bastard... Do you have it now? Give it to me! This is beyond my control, you should call my superiors. - Sorry, I got a meeting! - Prosecutor Park! - I'm sorry! - Park! Tae-su, you asshole! Dammit! Sir, the party leader is here. Who turned off the music? Turn it back on, assholes! The battle's not over! Turn it on and dance! Let's dance! Everyone up! Dance, you bastards! - Candidate #5! - I'm Jang Se-chool, vote for me. Sure. Thank you. Please vote. - Thank you. - Please vote #5. You should be resting, why did you come? There's no time for that. Candidate #5, please vote! Yes, please vote for us, thank you. This is weird... well... Win the election for sure. Give it to him. - Here. - What is it? Lunchbox, she made it. Hurry up! Good luck! Jung Cheol-min! Jung Cheol-min Hello everyone! Dr. Lee's here too! Good work, boss. It's judgment day. It's been hard. Mr. Hwangbo. Good luck! So-hyun. Se-chool, say what's in your heart. Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! That's right! But you all are heroes too! Front runner of new politics! He'll blossom into his own! Candidate #5... Let's bring out Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Good to see you all. I'm candidate #5, Jang Se-chool. How's living nowadays? Tough, isn't it? Yes! Even if you work hard, you get kicked out for redevelopment. Doesn't make sense! Why do we have to live this way? We didn't live this way! I know, why should we live this way? He's right! What's a good life? It's about sharing, isn't it? While following around Mr. Hwangbo Yoon, I learned so much. Sharing even if you got none, and I learned a lot while working at the diner. I got here this far after being a thug. I can't tell you I'm clean. But seeing you live by helping each other, I think I understand what I have to do. Please help me achieve this. I was born and raised in Mokpo! Mokpo is my home and my mother! If you vote for me, I'll dedicate my life to this city! Send me to Congress! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! I'm at a Mokpo polling station in Yongdang district. Voting has begun at 6 AM this morning, Woori's Choi Man-su came early to vote with his family. Between 6 AM and 2 PM, over 17.8 million people out of 42 million electorates have voted. Jeonnam province has the highest turnout in the country with 70.1%. The votes will be counted soon at 253 polling stations. I'm holding the exit poll results, this is quite nerve wracking. The politician who will lead Korea for the next 4 years, who did our citizens vote for? Closing of polling stations and unveiling of the exit poll in... 10! 9! 8! 7! 6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! Fucking hell... Hey, did you vote? Yup. Who did you vote? Why is that any of your business? You didn't vote for that loser Jang Se-chool, right? That'd be so dumb, he was a thug whom you used to chase after him. He's not a thug, you're a thug. Officer Jeon, come here. Did you vote for that loser? You didn't for vote for him, right? That's incredible! The results are out?! Who won?! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! Jang Se-chool! I'm at Jang Se-chool's campaign office. Let's have a short interview with the newly elect himself. Cheers. How do you feel to be elected? First of all, I'd like to thank all of you for voting for Mokpo's new future. From here on... I don't believe this. I'll work my hardest for advancement of Mokpo. To the people of this city, who voted for... Advisor Han Man-sub Yeah, what? Sir, where are you? Who cares?! Just tell them I'm abroad, so I can't be reached. It's not that, sir, it's about... Incompetent fucks. Eh? What's that? Christ. Over here please! Where's my gum? This way! Dammit... Roll down the window, please. Blow into it. Good evening, I'm Choi Man-su. That's nice, blow into this. I'm a congressman from Mokpo! You are Choi Man-su, good to meet you! But you stink of booze, did you drink? Where are your manners? Buddy! Buddy! What did you just say? You bastard. Am I your friend? Are we BFF? You're no in the congress anymore... You son of a bitch! Where do you belong? Tell me, asshole! Stop it! - Officer Lee, grab him! - Ow! My arm! - Ow! That hurts! - Stay put! I'm Choi Man-su! It still hasn't sunk in yet. Right? Me too. I'm a good person now, right? Aye. Eh? I'm a Southerner too. Why didn't you say that before? Se-chool. When we first met, why did you do it? Do what? At the protest. You pulled everyone away after I slapped you. My mind cleared up after your slap. I'm pretty weak to ladies too. You didn't fall for me? Not at all. Oh, I see... You really do get pissy easily. I totally fell for you, I was kidding. How could I not? Forget it! It's pretty crazy already. Let's wrap it up quickly before it gets out of control. Sure, boss. Let's go. Move in! Why did we take on this stupid job? So-hyun, aren't they thugs? They sent goons now? Look how big they are, they're so scary. Don't be scared, you gotta stand up to them. They're so dead. - Let's go! - Okay. Directed by KANG YOON-SUNG My head... You snored so much that I couldn't sleep a wink. Who is that? How much did you drink? We're in lockup. You made a big stink at the station and were sent here. Me? You got caught for drunk driving and went berserk! You went all-out! You were gonna be here either way! You'll learn your lesson if you rot in jail for 50 years. What did you... My head... Han! Hey, Han! Han! You should be calling out your lawyer instead of him. How did a fucker like him serve 2 terms? Maybe I should be one too! Hello?
