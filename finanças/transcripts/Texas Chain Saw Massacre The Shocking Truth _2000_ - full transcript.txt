- [Narrator] The film which you are about to see is an account of the making of a cult classic. A group of young filmmakers, technicians and actors produced a film in Austin in 1973, which would depict the mad and the macabre as it had never been seen before in a motion picture. For them the low-budget production in the sweltering heat of the Texas summer would prove a difficult experience and the worldwide success of the picture would be soured by dishonesty and corruption. But the events of that summer shoot would change the face of the horror film and lead to the production of one of the most bizarre films in the annals of American cinema history, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. (disturbing sound effec) - Shooting Texas Chain Saw Massacre was like a really grueling, fun but very chaotic experience of filmmaking. (disturbing sound effect) - When I got through, I didn't care if I never worked on another picture. - People were puking, you know, on that set continuously. - Cuts and thorns and weeds and dirt and rocks and bugs and ... getting hurt. (disturbing sound effect) - To this day, I've never met anybody who's blase about the film. They either love it or they hate it and they've loved it or they've hated it for years. (disturbing sound effect) - Everything is incited to attack the audience and that is something that we don't find in horror anymore. Everybody wants to shake your hand or meet you halfway and then try and scare you by hiding behind the door. No, this thing was coming out in fucking clown paint, blood spattered, with homicide on its brain. (disturbing music) - The armadillo shot was just, that's just pure ridiculous accident. The original script called for there to be a run over dog in the road, a shot of this run over dead dog, and come up to the van going by. - The script started with a shot of the sun and then the sun was to dissolve into ... the glazed portion of a dead dog's eye and the camera starts moving back out of that then you see the van pull up in the background. - But they got out to shoot that and God had given them the most wonderful gift in the world; there was this dead horse by the side of the road. This never happens. You never see a dead horse lying by the side of the road. This was the perfect thing, this giant dead horse covered with flies, the perfect thing to shoot and pull up to this thing. But they didn't want to shoot that because their delicate sensibilities meant that they had been close enough to shoot it and it would stink. I went out driving around the countryside and saw a freshly killed armadillo that hat just been hit by a car so I took it home and got a book about how to do taxidermy and I taxidermied this armadillo just for the hell of it. - So that ended up being the dead thing in the road and not the dead dog. I mean domestic creatures, domesticated creatures, it was just too horrible. - "You've got an armadillo, "we'll just put it down on the ground, "run over it and splatter its guts everywhere." And I said, "No you won't." - I don't recall ever having the idea of running over his armadillo. (chuckles) I respected that armadillo. - And they said, "Okay, we won't destroy it." - Bob, I had no intention of messing up your armadillo, so help me God. - To me, it's a completely ridiculous looking thing but then people have gone into just great paeans of glory about this wonderful, spectacularly grand, brilliant opening. (laughs) I love movies. - [Narrator] The Summer of Love was over. The '60s ended with Charles Manson and his family bringing a new dark perspective to the ideal of free hippie life. The Vietnam War continued to rage on under the Nixon government. Advances in technology had allowed man to walk on the moon. American cinema was also changing in the wake of Easy Rider, as young radical filmmakers started to replace the Hollywood old-school and the horror genre was no exception. In 1968, George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead brought horror home in graphic detail. Gone were the creatures from outer space and monsters from Eastern European folklore. Night of the Living Dead was not set in some distant past in some far-off land. The threat, flesh-eating human beings attacking the modern American home, the violence lingering and visceral, the climax inconclusive, stubbornly refusing to provide the audience with a satisfactory resolution to help them sleep at night. Night of the Living Dead was an enormous success on the drive-in and midnight movie circuits and set a precedent for the genre from which there was no turning back. The emphasis now was on the contemporary attack on the American dream. Young vital filmmakers were eager to depict their visions of a dysfunctional American and horror was the perfect milieu for that metaphor. Drive-in screens across the US were flooded with this new wave in low-budget horror cinema. (unsettling music) In 1972 a collaboration between Sean S. Cunningham who would go on to direct the popular slasher prototype Friday the 13th and Wes Craven of Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream fame would bring horror inside the harmony and safety of the middle American home with The Last House on the Left. In this case the violence was arguably as hardcore as had ever been depicted in cinema. In The Last House there are no living dead cannibals, just a gang of criminals hell-bent on a rampage of rape, murder and dismemberment: the elimination of the supernatural from the horror film. Interestingly the final showdown features death by chainsaw. At this time a young graduate from the film program at the University of Texas in Austin called Tobe Hoover was making his first independent feature, Eggshells. Hooper was already considered an up-and-coming talent among Austin filmmakers, having directed two PBS-funded documentaries. Eggshells would win an award at the Atlanta Film Festival but received only limited distribution. Hooper wanted to get to Hollywood and knew that he could not do this by making art films with limited audience appeal. He and Eggshells co-writer Kim Henkel decided it was necessary to write a picture in an established genre. - None of the titles that we used prior to release were intended to be anything other than working titles. Almost in jest one time we called it Headcheese. - The original title was Stalking Leatherface. What do you do with that? - It was called Leatherface when it was found and a couple of other things, but Leatherface I think was the last title at the head on it, until Skaaren came up with the name The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. - I want your friend of mine, and I threw the title out. Said, "I would never see that. "My girlfriend won't see it. "I will not see this, nothing by that name." And I said, "That's it. "That's the title." (disturbing music) - And with a title like "Texas" and "Chain Saw" and "Massacre," heck, I'd go see it. - But the Texas Chain-- Because I mean, people think of Texas. I thought of Texas the same way. It's a different country. - The significance of Texas, it's kind of a place where something like the bloody benders could have happened. And the isolation and the rural. - It's kind of like city boy, country boy thing. We're all afraid that out there in those kind of dark corners of rural America or wherever it may be that there are these inbred types that are doing terrible and dastardly things. - It's like I was always, in Texas always lived in the city. And out there got kind of scary. - And I think one of the appeals of the film is that it's not a supernatural film. You watch this movie and you think there are people like this in the world. (ominous music) - [Narrator] The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was inspired by the story of Ed Gene. In a small farm town of Plainfield, Wisconsin, young Ed grew up in the '30s with a domineering mother who instilled in the impressionable boys strict religious guidelines and the idea of all women as filthy diseased harlots. Ed's mother passed away. Unable to cope with the loss, Ed sealed off her bedroom and kept the house exactly as it was when she was alive. In his loneliness Ed began holding conversations with her and before long started paying visits to the local graveyard to dig up fresh graves and bring parts of the bodies home. He would eat the flesh, make furniture out of bones, and even dress up in the skin of the cadavers. - I was like three or four years old. And so when the Wisconsin relatives came to town, they always had this story. Because they could see that it wound me up and it started scaring the hell out of me, and so they would tell the story about the guy that makes the ... covered his furniture with skin, with human skin, human skin lampshades. Oh my god. - [Narrator] It was only a matter of time before Ed's dementia would lead to murder. Ed was arrested in 1958 when his second known victim was found hanging by the ankles in the barn behind his house, naked and gutted like a deer. It stuck with me. It was always ever-present. - You've heard the expression "you are what you eat"? Well Leatherface is what he wears. He assumes the personality and the character of the mask he dons. - He's the most powerful character in the film physically. He is the most violent of the characters in the film. He is also the most frightened character in the film. - He has somehow, by the older brother ... probably, assumed that role, the feminine role in the house. - Even though he's extremely violent and dangerous, in fact, he's really defending himself, that's really what he does. - He's a big baby. Inside the movie he freaks out because he doesn't know where in the hell are they coming from. Where are all these people coming from? - The character came out of long discussions with Tobe and Kim and then my attempt to say, how do I create that personality without having a voice or a face? So what I did was I went to a state school which was a residential community, campus community for retarded persons, and I just spent these two days on the campus walking around, watching the way people moved. After two days I walked across campus and I felt that no one could tell whether I was a patient there or just an interloper. - The main that strikes me is you've got this farmhouse, and you've got three generations living there, and they're all guys. Aren't there any women? You know? And it's so funny, 'cause Kim says, "Well ... "That's part of the mystery of it." So, what did I want to achieve with the chainsaw family? Just scare the shit out of somebody. (chuckles) - Grandma was not in the script. I just made grandma. I said, "At least have a petrified grandmother "sitting up there to show at one time there were women." - Get togethers, reunions, whatever, holidays. I've seen more dysfunction and more hell riddled through families than I would like to have. I wish I hadn't seen ... that much weirdness in family behavior. So I kind of always wanted to do something that's about a dysfunctional family. - What we did is to create two corporations. One was Vortex, which was the production company, and the other was MAB, which was the investor corporation. - Basically Tobe and I formed it in a sense. I mean we didn't do the legal work obviously but we created it as a company that was really the production company. - The production company of course controlled the production and the investor corporation funded it, but the control was with production with the production corporation, Vortex, as far as the film was concerned. And then the investors got their original investments back and then after that it was split 50-50. (screaming) - And I was with the Texas Film Commission we started. So I knew what we were trying to bring films to Texas and all of a sudden there was this film being made by a Texan instead of flying him in from New York or LA. - At that time in Austin, Tobe was the only filmmaker who had actually done a feature film and so for us to have the opportunity to work with him we were all really thrilled as young film students. - He was telling me about this the next picture he wanted to do was a horror picture but "unlike any horror picture you've ever seen, Wayne." - I heard about Tobe Hooper, this wacky guy who had made a movie called Eggshells was getting ready to make this horror movie, and they were looking for young people to walk in and get their brains smashed in. I said, "I can do that." (knocking) - Hello? - He was going to school at the University of Texas, taking filmmaking as his major, and he was graduating this year. And he had written this play called Leatherface, or this movie called Leatherface. And he wanted to write me in to consider if I would take a part in it for him. - Look what your brother did to that door! - They're making this movie in town, these fellow local guys, and it's a shame, because you would have been perfect to play the killer, but they've already hired somebody to be the killer. (chainsaw buzzing) A week later I'm walking down the street and I run into him. I don't even remember him. And he stops me in the street and said, "You know, this guy they hired, he's drunk, "he's drunk in a motel and he won't come out, "and they're desperate." (bouncy folk music) - [Narrator] Shooting began on July 15th, 1973 and would last for 32 days. - The shooting schedule was desperate. - Oh it was murderous, you know. It was hot, was the middle of August. - Seven days a week, 12 to 16 hours a day. - It was an extremely difficult shoot in the sense that it was extremely hot. And we were extremely low budget. Everything's extreme on the shoot. - At the time, I had just gotten a Ford Econoline van because I wanted a something to kind of carry my equipment around in. We had high hopes of making a lot of movies in Austin and Tobe needed a van for the kids to be traveling in. And so we made sort of a deal. I was sound man, my van was there every day, so you could rent my van, and so they'd use my van for the production. ♪ Spend most every day ♪ In the sidewalk cafe ♪ Drinking coffee - Inside a van on the road in Texas is not a pleasant place to be at almost any time. It's in the middle of August, it's hot. It was so hot that you could only shoot for a matter of a few minutes. It was cramped because you got a sound guy you got a fellow with a camera that's trying to get out of the way and trying to get the best shots. It was fun to see Tobe get cramped up and upside down and every which way inside that van. - I think we got along pretty good. We had our trying days. I mean we got along pretty well. - The unit that's in the van obviously are friends and these were people that were brought together and I'm not sure if any of them knew one another so I had them spend a lot of time together. - And even within the group in the van it was funny because Paul was like the outsider intentionally ... I mean in the van he was but then also just as we hung out too. Paul was kind of like ... (laughs) Ostracized, send him over there. - Unfortunately Franklin was such a whiny bastard that I was afraid if I ever took him off that I couldn't get him back. And so I kept him on. And so it was easy for me to go, "God, I don't wanna be near that son of a bitch!" (laughing) You can't blame them, either. (cackling) - He really was Franklin, 'cause Paul Partain is really a nice guy. The guy I met named Franklin was easy to act with because you really didn't have to do much acting. - Sally? What now? - It was very easy to imagine that, okay, this is the kind of treatment that Franklin would get and the kind of treatment Franklin would deserve, because he's just ... (whines) Who wants to be around that shit all day? - Come on, Franklin! It's gonna be a fun trip! - Yes, it was real effective. We were ready to kill each other. (laughs) - There wasn't like a bad egg in the group. Some shoots we've all worked on and there'll be one jerk or one problem person. But except for Bob yelling at us all the time, "Don't touch that chair! "Get off of that stool! (cacophonous sound effect) - Well to try to make it look like not an art director's play idea of what insane people would do but trying to make it look like where they live, not trying to get into their minds, mind you, but just sitting back and saying, okay, there they have these parts left over from people and animals that they've killed, and what would they do with them? So what are the parts? They are bones and skin and hair and teeth. If they are going to make things out of them, what they would make out of them. - It was really brilliant stuff. And as far as I know, most of that stuff he made it, he designed it, he made it, I'm sure with Tobe's influence and direction, but they were art pieces to tell you the truth. - I described this human skeleton totem, and then I described to him several things like a jib that's made of, say, railroad ties so it looks substantial and homemade for the meat hooks. And so Bob would go instantly, and like overnight he would he would invent another prop or another mask or another piece of ... dead art. - Long time ago the counties would, if an animal died, the county would come, an abattoir or something would come and pay you five bucks to take away the animal and render it for fertilizer. Then the county got to where they'd come around and pick 'em up for free. But then they got to where you had to pay them to come pick up the dead animals, and at that point the farmers just said to heck with this, and so if a cow died or something, they'd haul it off in a distant corner of a field and just let it go away. And so we went up there and we went around all these farms where there were cattle skeletons everywhere and gathered up a whole lot of them that way. - He was having trouble finding so more exotic bones. At the time I was working part-time for a veterinarian, so I had access to a huge bone yard. I knew there were some monkey bones out there, and Bob just had a field day. He took his knapsack, and it was hilarious watching him just jumping over all these things, jumping for joy and just loading up his knapsack like q complete insane person. (laughing) - There was a lot of collecting of a dead animal parts. (unsettling music) We dragged all that stuff in there. It was it was just a nice old country kitchen. It was an old house, a very nice house and ... went in and decked it out. - It was ... just like the family should live there. And so already when you walk in and you saw all this, you felt uncomfortable, itchy. You didn't want to touch anything. - At the time I don't think we really appreciated it as much as I do now, especially since I am decorating sets. I just think it was it was another character in the movie and it would not have been the same movie without all of his work. - I worked a long time doing experimentations of material to try to make something that might look like human skin that was peeled off and dried. And like the Leatherface faces we took molds of people's faces and I came up with this ... formula, if you will, of using ... liquid latex and some fiberglass insulation material that I could peel off in very, very thin sheets and stick in there and so it layered up and so it was fibrous looking, and it was translucent, and it ... and it would naturally turn this kind of brownish yellowish color. It would maintain a bit of the facial form. People we see getting killed in movies they'd been hit on the head with a sledgehammer, so each of 'em is gonna have a hole or has been abraded, bashed through right there. And so then, okay, what would they patch that up with? So wired it up with thin wire, and it was all this very crude stuff, and sewed on things to make it look like they had peeled somebody's face that they had killed and then had the face, they had the mouth kind of wired open with wire inside it and wired everything you could see what they did. (unsettling sound effect) - In cinema, at least at that time, a death scene was portrayed as someone fires the gun and someone would fall over. At one time I wanted to be either a doctor, a mad scientist, or a magician. And so, I knew that it's not easy to kill somebody. - Gunnar in my memory was this big teddy bear kind of a guy. Large guy but sweet as sweet could be. And I remember every time he hit me, one time he slipped and he really hit me with the hammer and was just like very upset about the fact that he had hurt me. (squelching) - A blow to the skull with a heavy hammer would send bone fragments first down into the brain, which would cause involuntary spasms. (thumping) - 'Cause also he was picking me up at the end and then throwing me over and then slamming the door. And after every take he would come over, "Are you okay?" - Then you get the imagery of slaughterhouse when Leatherface drags him up that little ramp like this is the little mock slaughterhouse and he closes this leather door. (door slams) (disturbing music) - You think you've seen this slaughter. I'm very, very pleased, you come out of this thing thinking you've seen a bloodbath, and you've seen very little blood. And I take credit for a whole lot of that, because when the girl gets hung on the meat hook, Tobe told me recently that he wanted the meat hook to come out the front and blood spurting. I said, "If you do that, people are gonna try "to figure out how you did the effect. - I put in a lot of telephone calls to the MPAA, asking their advice. How do I get an R rating? No, actually I said how do I get a PG rating and hang someone on a meat hook? - And I talked him into it will be much, much stronger with no blood at all, and that scene has not one drop of blood in it. - I knew how they were doing it at the time, and it still just scared the piss out of me, to tell you the truth. - I had to come up with something that would fit under this very skimpy costume that had the strength to hold her up. I also had to design it with a woman's anatomy in mind, because she was basically, all the weight would be on her crotch. - I had nothing to do with that, washed my hands of all that completely. They were pissed off at me at the time, but I said, "I'm not gonna do something like that." - Bob made for me, I talked to Bob and he made for me like a little saddle, almost like chastity belt looking thing which I stacked tons of sanitary napkins in for padding for her. Then, I came up with the idea to use nude stockings. I crisscrossed them across her body in the front and in the back. And then what was great, which I hadn't planned on, it worked really well, is there was this little bit of a jerk. - She won't talk about it, and I won't talk about it. - She was a great sport about it, and I think the longest we could hang her was about a minute. (chainsaw buzzing) - I had a two-year-old daughter at the time, and she would come out with my wife when she brought the food. And she would just kinda play around the set and go into people's trailers. But on one particular day, the day when the kids are hung on the meat hooks and Leatherface is cutting off the head of the boyfriend ... (chainsaw buzzing) Lunch came just at that moment as we started rolling camera, and my daughter came running in to say hello to everybody just as Leatherface was coming down with his chainsaw. And she screamed to high heaven and went running out of that house and down the road and was like trying to get away. - No one had seen this kind of thing. People didn't know how to react. - They didn't want the victims, they didn't want the actors to see me, because they wanted the ... They wanted the them to be genuinely frightened when they get killed. (screaming) - I had set myself up where I was going. I had myself blindfolded, and I had them lead me into the room and just kind of block it out without me even seeing what Gunner looked like in the mask. - The shot was simply I was gonna come running into the room and, screaming at him, I was gonna raise the hammer, he screams in terror, and I hit him and kill him with the hammer. To make it look realistic, there was a fellow actually on the floor behind him who had his hand in the back of his belt so that, as I swung the hammer, because my hammer wasn't obviously wasn't gonna hit him, as I swung the hammer he was gonna jerk Allen to the floor. - I worked myself up, I was getting really into it, blah blah blah, and they do the action, camera, rolling. - I come roaring in, Allen turns, there's this beautiful look of horror in his face. - I start screaming, giving a blood-curdling scream. - He rips loose of the belt guy and dives out the door, ruining the shot. He was so frightened he couldn't do the take. - Sally, I hear somethin'. Stop, stop! (chainsaw buzzing) - When Leatherface comes out of the bushes, that's still the scariest moment in the movie for me. - So when I saw him in his rig, it was a total surprise. - I can't help it. You're in it, stupid. But no, it's still ... It's still scary. - Dottie Pearl was on the left side, right here. Tobe was on the right, camera was shooting over my shoulder, Gunnar was of course coming in. We had read Karo syrup in our mouth. That was the fake blood. All three of us had a mouthful of it, and every time Gunnar would come in and make a pass, we'd all spit. (screaming) - And it gave me a chance to take another giant sip of blood while they were pulling the chainsaw back. And every time they would hit, I would spew this blood again. - They were squirting to get ... to see in the flashlights, hopefully to see some spray go and some ... You don't the wounds happening. You see the after effect of it. But yeah, we were either spitting it or flinging it or something, I don't know. - And we just kept doing it until we were all out of spit. - And it worked great, because it looked like it was hitting, of course, a main artery. - There were a lot of people getting hurt and like ... I don't know if it's so much the subject matter. I guess so. But there was always seemed like there was that edge that, if you weren't careful, you were gonna get hurt, and people did, I know Marilyn did. - Those black eyes and everything were real. I had to remember where it was in the picture to see if I needed makeup to remove 'em. (smacking) (screaming) - Started out trying to beat her, they gave me this stick, that broom handle. It was a real broom handle, it was wood. - Poor Jim. We shot that all night long. Hour after hour we were doing all these takes and he was trying to pull the punches, and Tobe would tell him, "It looks like you're pulling the punches." - And I had to hold back, and he'd keep, "You can't, don't hold back, it looks fake." "We'd give you a rubber one to hit her with, "that looks fake too." - Take after take it's getting later and later. - Finally we did it so much and Marilyn was getting beaten up a little bit. She told me, "Jim, come on, let's get it over with." About the eighth time I finally was catchin' on to it. I'm really lacin' it to her, and they said it was the take. Boy, Marilyn, she just keeled over. - One shot where I'm in the chair with the arms, they needed a gag, and they said, "Somebody get a rag or something." - So somebody found something on the floor somewhere and got this gross, filthy rag that had been gosh knows where. And, "That looks good. "Oh, put it in her mouth." This is a gritty, nasty, disgusting ... that we're gonna have to use again and again. No one thought about getting a clean one. And there was one time where Ed Neil's groping at me and I'm like this. And so I'm in this chair and my feet and hands are tied, and the camera's right there, and I'm going, getting away from Ed Neil, right, so I get so far away from Ed Neil, I go down. And there I am, tied to the armchair with my feet tied. And the first and the cameraman said is, (sighs) "She went out of the shot." And then, they just said well let's do such-and-such, and I'm sitting there on the floor with the gag in my mouth still. (laughs) Somebody get the girl. That made it-- Maybe they were all trying to get me in character. - As a production it was a very abusive production and you see things you don't want to do like working 27-hour days just because you didn't have your shit together enough to shoot it all in one day which you should have known you could if you'd have planned it. - The most grueling night of the shoot was the dinner scene that proved to be like a 27-hour shooting day. - 26 hours. - It was like a 27-hour shoot or something like that. - Almost 36 hours straight we shot. - I'm sure Tobe's got it up past 40 by now. - There were actually two reasons it had to be completed in one night. - They were losing me that day. I was through and had to go. I just had a week contract with them. - And the other reason is we'd run out of appliances for old grandpa, who was 18 or 19 years old. - And the poor guy, it was basically glued to his face so he was scarred for life. (screaming) - Okay, gang we're gonna be here til we finish this scene. And we all kind of accepted it. - Somebody decided to take this chicken, very clever, and make the head and have the feet, some kind of beautiful decoration for the center of the table. What they didn't think about was after ... day after day and under the lights and in a house that's totally has big black curtains over the windows to make sure no light was coming in at any time whether we were shooting day or night though we just kept going, that chicken started to rot. - We were shooting this in Texas in the summer. It was 95, 100, 105 degrees every day. And the dinner scene, though it takes place at night, it was shot during the day, so we covered up all the windows, or they covered up the windows, and then we had all this light in there, so that room was probably 120 degrees. I think that's a conservative estimate of the temperature in the dining room. - Boy was it hot. The meat got rotten in a hurry and we were all in there. I never did get ill physically. A lot of people did. They'd run outside and come back in. - There was a moment during the film when, during the dinner scene, when I went out and threw up. - The stench on that set was kind of a combination of Gunnar's perspiration because he was in that getup for so long that he was just drenched in sweat. - I was the smelliest element on the set. I mean, it's embarrassing to admit, but the problem was they had one costume for me; they had no money. They had one costume for me. They didn't dare have it cleaned, because they were afraid it'd be lost or the color'd change. So I wore the same clothes 12 to 16 hours a day for a month. - And we all really stank. (laughs) That's one thing I remember a lot, is the body odor. I think we all got pretty ripe. - One lamp is the room is made out of skeleton. The light bulb got close to the bones and it started the damn skeleton on fire, and smelling old bone was bad, too. - I was in the worst position on that 26-hour shoot. That was the big dinner scene, because, as the broom man, I was up highest, and heat rises, and so do all the smells. - What I remember of that shoot was just Marilyn screaming in my headphones for hour after hour after hour after hour. (screaming) - At that point there had been enough unfortunate instances with with dead dogs. - As set pieces they had made an attempt to put dead animals around the room. - A veterinarian that I knew worked at the local animal shelter. - They wanted these sitting around house and dogs and cats and things like this. Well I was going out finding stuffed animals all over the place. We were not finding stuff domestic dogs and cats. - They had a lot of dead animals, carcasses that they would burn. I would go out to the pile, the pile of bones or whatever, pretty much every week. And so I was able to get some animals that had been killed. - Dottie got this wonderful idea to embalm some. - I was injecting all of them with some formaldehyde just to keep them from ... stinking, stinking us out of the place and turning into maggots. - It was getting kind of grim, but then when Dottie had a had a dog in her lap, and was going to inject formaldehyde in the hind leg. This is terrible. And she she injected it, and it went through the leg and into her leg, and she shot herself with a little pop of formaldehyde. - I just almost became hysterical that I was going to suddenly stiffen up, harden up, and I had embalmed myself. - And then she said, "This is not happening." And I said, "No." - They started stinking to high heaven and and they tried cremating them. - Poured gasoline all over the, you know, and ignited this. I guess thinking that it would make it disappear. And it's a little more complicated than that, because it was like a a couple hundred pounds that had to just kind of disappear. - They wouldn't light, and so there was like this smoking dead dog aroma coming into the house in addition to all the headcheese and the dead chicken parts. It was a horrific night. - But it just went on and on and on. Tempers were getting frayed and all that, but we got through it, we really did. It was really a lot of fun when you think back on it. - It was rough, but we got it. (screaming) (glass shattering) - The window. This was what's so crazy. Tobe said "Marilyn, we don't want you "to jump through the sugar glass." I said, "Why?" - I guess I was so close to finishing it, I didn't want her to get hurt. - So Mary makes a jump of about a foot on the ground, and then they get me, and they put this scaffolding thing up here, where I'm six feet above the ground. And the Marilyn did drop like, I don't know, eight or 10 feet and do the landing. - I would have rather jumped out the window, but I guess this was more effective. I could have done without that seen. That one scared me, just simply 'cause I didn't want to break my ankle, which it did hurt my ankle, which is why I limp at the end of the picture. (chainsaw buzzing) (screaming) - Tobe and Kim, who were babying this project from the very beginning, but every day they would sit and discuss for hours what they were gonna shoot and did minor script revisions, so that we would sit there and wait for them to make their decisions before we could ever begin shooting any day, and so ultimately the production kind of slipped further and further behind. - The final day of shooting, I took off that white-- those pants that just stood up to greet me every morning and throw 'em down, and I thought, "I'm finished, "that's the end, that's over, never again "will I have to come and put on these horrible clothes, "I can get my hair back in condition, I get my skin back." I mean I was gonna have to rebuild everything, I was a mess. - Poor Marilyn Burns, at the end of the show, where I just literally took buckets and poured over her. I think it actually stained her blonder hair after a while. There was so much blonde she had pink hair. - And so I need a couple more shots. I need the hysterical shot of her as she's being taken away from Leatherface. - And they called me that night, and they said, "Marilyn, something happened. "We didn't get it." I said, "You didn't get what?" "We didn't get it. "We gotta reshoot this." So when I was crazy at the end of the movie laughing hysterically, that was not acting. That was me having to go back and do this one more time. (laughing hysterically) (unsettling sound effect) - [Narrator] To keep costs down, Hooper and Henkel convinced participants to defer salary until a distribution deal was struck, then awarded points. These points were not taken from the total gross, as some participants believed, but from Vortex's 50% ownership of the picture. - My last scene to shoot was my favorite. The first time you see Franklin, and it's the roll down the hill scene. And why I liked it was because, when we got to that point, they owed me a couple weeks' pay. I mean it's just a couple hundred, $300. It wasn't much, but I didn't believe the film would ever go out. And even if it did or didn't, I didn't care. I needed to be paid. And they were out of money, so they were making everybody or offering deals to defer payment and to do-- They were scraping by. They were scraping the bottom of the barrel. - So the day before I said, "I got bills to pay, you got bills to pay. "Here's the deal. "Either I get paid or you get some other fat boy "to go down the hill." So I met with Ron Bozman. He was the acting producer, assistant producer, whatever, and he cut me a check, which was great, paid in full. So when I go down the hill, in that pocket, there's a check that says "paid in full". (grunting) - Once we finished shooting, we were like snotty film students, and we thought that we knew everything. And of course, like most snotty film students, that the director was an idiot and didn't know what he was doing. And we sort of regret that, that we took that attitude while we were shooting, but we couldn't help ourselves. And we finished shooting and then the movie was in the editing room for a year or more. - Cut to film in my living room. And right next to it was a little room, a little bedroom where I had the musical instruments. So I scored in one room and cut in the other. (unsettling music) - Our instrumentation, a lot of it was toys. - I had been working with experimental music for some time, and Wayne was into sound. - Oftentimes it'd be like, "Let's just do a rumble. "Let's just do seething." These calls came from Tobe, generally, "Let's just do ice." - I had this African instrument, metal instrument hanging hanging from it. It had things on it like tambourines, those little things. And I would I would saw that damn thing as hard as I could. I put as much pressure on the string so you could hear the the increments as the bow slipped across the-- (imitates instrument) And as it did that, then these things would rattle, too. - And, indeed, by using the unconventional, that opened up the possibility. So, you're not doing a fugue, you're doing bones. - So I had a library of all kinds of sound that I could then control by editing. - [Narrator] The production ran out of funds during editing and Henkel and Hooper had to sell yet more shares in Vortex. - They'd come up with a budget of $60,000, and that's what he funded, and he said, "Anything, you need any more money than that, "you gotta get it out ... "you gotta sell part of your interest." - Tobe and I had to sell off ... basically our portion, a good chunk of our portion of the film in order to raise more money. - [Narrator] Chain Saw was screened for most of the major studios, but none were interested in distributing the picture. - We showed it to AIP, showed it to ... showed around, and then this group, this new group, Bryanston Films, showed it to them. They said instantly, said, "We'll buy it on the spot." - We got this letter that said, "Hey, we made a deal with Bryanston." Hubba hubba hubba. This is gonna come out. I said oh, great. And Steve came in the office that day, and I said, "Look, we made a deal with Bryanston," and Steve said, "They're Mafia." - [Narrator] The Texas Chain Saw Massacre opened in drive-ins and hardtop theaters across Texas in October 1974. - [Announcer] The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. After you stop screaming, you'll start talking about it. - Friends of mine hired a limousine for me. It was a premiere for me. It was at the Village Cinema. - And there it was, and it looked like a real film. And I wasn't expecting it to be a real film. I thought it was gonna be something that would maybe get shown somewhere at drive-in somewhere and that would be about it. - I was kind of like in shock the first time I saw it, because it was just this this ... unrelenting nightmare of a movie. - I thought it was pretty bad. - I liked the movie a lot. I remember being stunned by the sense of humor. - I remember being really impressed with the rawness of the film. When it was put together, the kind of sense of butchery of human beings, and the terror of it was, to me, like a groundbreaking horror film. - I saw a poster in front of the cinema: who will survive and what will be left of them? I could not miss this movie. it was just that the greatest poster I've ever seen. I never believed in my wildest imagination that this movie would actually deliver the groceries. - God awful! Hail holy hell, it's a Texas Chain Saw Massacre! To me, that was as profound a cinematic experience as seeing 8 1/2 and Citizen Kane and Dawn of the Dead. - The whole cinema bonded into one mass hysterical group watching this movie that was just totally outrageous. - Rex Reed said it's the scariest movie he'd ever seen such as that. And then it really took off. - Yeah, it got really good reviews and people loved it and it kind of surprised all of us who worked on it because we weren't really prepared for any sort of acclaim to accrue to that movie. - This movie is happening. It's number three. It's coming up. It had a bullet on it. It's shooting to the top. It's playing here, it's playing there. - All of a sudden you're part of something, and you start reading the news publications that said, okay, it took in millions here and millions there, and it broke records everywhere. - Most of us had different percentages, so I thought it's gonna be at least a payday. - [Narrator] But according to Bryanston's reports, the Texans' 35% share of profits amounted to $5,734. - So you start looking up your little percentages of a percentage of a production company that has X percentage of the production companies. - My temptation is to call it a deception, but maybe it was a misunderstanding, but essentially what no one ever found out, well I certainly never knew, was that Vortex didn't own the film. So what we were paid in our percentages were a fraction of what we thought we were supposed to get. Vortex turned out to be one of I think three companies who had financial interest in the film. So when I'm being given points, I think I'm being given points in a film, but I'm actually being given points in a company that owns points in the film. - We had this percentage, half a point or a point, whatever it was, of the net, which now I realize it's like you're not gonna get anything, so don't expect it, basically. But we didn't know that at the time. - But still, even making all those calculations, you think, "Okay, well there's some dollars "that should be rolling in here." - Nine months after film was released, when we were expecting to see a lot of money because the movie was doing so well, my first royalty check was for $47.07. - That was a very unpleasant experience for most of the people involved. It was a film made for $125,000 that should have been about half of that, and it was a film that made we don't know how much but at least $100 million dollars, and we saw pittance out of it, because for one reason or another we got ripped off. - I had never intended to get rich from this movie. I was, frankly, I was stunned that anything ever came at all. - I was on my own, I didn't have a lot of financial commitments, so I wasn't in debt, but I know some of the other guys really struggled, because they had bills, they had families, and they knew the movie was making a lot of money, and they had counted on that money. - I'm making ... have a chance to get a few shekels out of this movie. (laughs) Have life a little bit easier for myself, my son. Not to be. See, that's where the massacre is, is after the movie. - My feeling was it had launched my career, and that was enough for me. - I was the only person involved in the production of the picture that took action against the producers of the picture for the way we were treated. - Kim Henkel and Bill Parsley and Warren Skaaren and I went to New York. And then Warren and I went down to Bryanston's office to talk to ... Lou ... I've called him Lou Piranha so long that I can't really ever remember his real name. - Basically they made a deal with a known Mafia company and they couldn't figure out why they get ripped off with it. (chuckles) Think about it. Made a deal with a guy named Butchie Peraino. What do you think? (chuckles) - And we walked into his office, and he was seated there with a couple of big henchmen on either side of him just like it was just like in the movies. I told him we'd come to audit the books and we wanted to see 'em, and he said, well, they weren't available. And I said, "Well, you're either gonna have to let me "see those books, or I'm gonna have to sue you." And he just looked me straight in the eye and said, "You don't have enough balls to sue me." And he was half right; I came back here and sued him. (chuckles) - [Narrator] But by the time the Texans sued Bryanston in May 1976, the company was apparently broke. Instead of forcing Bryanston into bankruptcy, the Texans settled for an out-of-court payment in February 1977 of $400,000 for their share of profits and to relinquish control of the movie. - I don't guess anybody will ever know exactly how much that they stole. - [Narrator] the Texas Chain Saw Massacre, despite its lack of on-screen bloodshed, would attract an R-rating in the States. However, elsewhere in the world, the censors were not quite so lenient. In 1975, the British Board of Film Censors refused to grant Chain Saw a theatrical certificate, with BBFC secretary James Fuhrman commenting that the film seemed like the pornography of terror. - Fuhrman said at the screening of Texas Chain Saw Massacre that this film is fine for middle-class intellectuals at the national film theater but imagine its effect on the average car worker in Birmingham. James Furhman actually went through the film to see what could or should be cut and discovered that there was no one individual scene or image that was unacceptable, that it was the massive kind of cumulative frenzy of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre which wasn't acceptable, and therefore the whole thing had to be cut. - [Narrator] And the film remained on the BBFC blacklist for 23 years. - It is subjective, and the sooner that's admitted by all and sundry, the better I would say. - [Narrator] With a long history of inconsistent decision making, it is perhaps not surprising that, as soon as James Furman retired from his position at the BBFC in 1998, the new guardians of moral decency in Britain, Robin Duvall and Andreas Whittam Smith, finally decided that Chain Saw was no longer a threat to decent society, and the film was subsequently granted an 18 certificate in an uncut form. (chainsaw buzzing) In the 25-plus years since the Texas Chain Saw Massacre first assaulted the senses of a mass audience, its popularity has continued to grow, and now a generation of horror fans who were not even born when the film was made consider Leatherface as one of our cinemas crazy villains. - [Interviewer] What's your favorite scene from Chain Saw, fellas? - Leatherface. - [Interviewer] Pardon me? - Leatherface. (discordant sound effect) - I see it, it was the cameraman's job and Tobe's job to avoid me. So I was actually swinging the saw. And felt it was like my one moment in this movie where I'm going to try to kill Tobe Hooper. (audience laughing) (discordant sound effect) - What are you doing? It's a nice camera. - [Narrator] The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has had an unquestionable effect on the horror genre. It is arguable that the elusive killer Leatherface has inspired a whole multitude of mass-slashers throughout the '70s '80s and '90s, and it is claimed that the origin of the triumphant surviving female, now a staple of the genre, originated with Chain Saw's Sally. - What I wanted to do was to come out of my mental institution and go after the family. That was my-- I thought I would make a good movie. - [Narrator] Being the product of a genre synonymous with exploitation, coupled with the fact that Leatherface survives the length of the original film, it was only a matter of time before the sexually ambiguous chainsaw wielding maniac would make a return to the big screen. (chainsaw buzzing) - I brooded for years that no one appreciated or saw the humor or the comedy (chuckles) in Chain Saw. It's true, it took like eight years, it was so damn shocking. - [Narrator] The Texas Chain Saw Massacre part two was a big-budget Hollywood production starring Dennis Hopper, arriving almost 10 years after the original. The emphasis was on black comedy, but this didn't stop Hooper from pulling out all the stops as far as gore was concerned. - "We want you to be in it." "Can you be in it?" He said, "We want to start it next June." Whatever it was, I said, "Yeah, fine." Why they only got me back, I don't know. - They asked me to be in the-- If I was interested in being in the film. And I was. The problem was what they were offering me for pay. They offered me scale, union scale plus 10%. And I asked them why there was this 10% added, and they said it was for your agent. So I said I wouldn't accept it, that I thought that that was much too little and that I wanted them to think about what they thought I was worth to the film and then come back with some offer that reflected that value. And a week or two later, they came back with scale. They dropped the 10%. I mean, they didn't raise the price at all. And I asked why, and the woman said, "Well, you don't have an agent, so you don't need the 10%." - I wanted to hire Ed for the hitchhiker role. I simply couldn't make a deal with the agent. I had been sent a couple of years before that this little homemade film called The Texas Chain Saw Manicure. - Manicure! (chainsaw buzzing) (screaming) - He loved The Manicure. He wanted to know who played the hitchhiker. I said, "Well, that was me." And he said, "Well, you know, "if I ever do Chain Saw 2, I'll keep you in mind." - I got the best manicure ever! - Hey! That's great, honey! We should celebrate with some headcheese! - I had a little free-floating anxiety, and all of a sudden here comes Jim Siedow. Without even thinking what to say, it just kind of came out of me, I went, "It's the cook!" And he went, "Hey, how ya doin'?" Just meeting him was just so great. It totally grounded me, and it just made it ... It turned whatever that anxiety was into an excitement that this was gonna be a lot of fun. - You hog bitch! - Difference of day and night. Second one, boy, that was nothin' but money. Finest places to stay, the finest of everything, limousines at your disposal. - It's a crazy, loony film. It's a hysterical movie. - Lick my plate, you dog dick! - The film that was written and shot was truly a wonderful satire and was a wonderful film, and I hope that one day Tobe can put out his own cut of that movie. - I doubt it, because God only knows where the material is. - The biggest thing that I recall is Canon films just ... They were really horrible. They were horrible. They treated Tobe horribly. And they were constantly second-guessing him, looking over his shoulder, pulling money, giving money. They were just really arbitrary about all of their decision. - We had some kind of legacy. (chuckles) And we were bound and determined to try to make it as good as number one. - I think Bill Johnson had a real burden, because, first of all, the Leatherface they wanted him to create clearly was not the same Leatherface in personality as the original film. - The mask that Tom Savini is ran in the paper the other day. It's looks an art direct. You can see Tom Savini at work, rather than Leatherface made this. - Two different movies but still two pretty good movies, I thought. - This was going to be a magic, wonderful revisitation. The first film but better, the first film but the why behind the first film, a bit of the why behind the first film. And Canon films didn't want the why. They just wanted the first film over and over again. - Well, it was not finished for one thing. There were ... There were incomplete sequences. - And they got a hold of it and cut it themselves and just fucked it up. - Canon at that time started running their business out of a couple of different countries. They were based in Israel some of the time and sometimes in LA. - We opened at number one as I recall. It took a pretty steep dive after that, unfortunately. But as far as residual payments and ancillary markets and things like that, the films never really supposedly showed a profit. And it's got too much of a cult following, I think, for that to be possible. - Nobody was willing to invest the money to go, to audit their books. - Look at the meat on that one! (cackles) - What happened to the money? Where's our money? What happened? Because the first one, the big rumor in Austin always was that there was some shady financiers behind the film and that's where all of it went. I suppose Canon Films now are the shady financiers behind number two. - In fact, I think, all things considered, it came out .. It came out well, regardless of what if it was what I set out to do or not. - [Narrator] Leatherface would return again in a far less lavish New Line production in Leatherface: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Part 3. - I basically was like probably literally this 50th choice to do this movie. I really think they literally went down a list, 'cause I've met so many directors in the subsequent years that say, "Oh yeah, you did that Leatherface movie. "Yeah, I was offered that, but man, I just couldn't do it." So I think it was just literally I got it by total default. 'Cause I know McNaughton turned it down, Peter Jackson. They literally went through a list. New Line said, "Legally you cannot speak "to Tobe Hooper or Kim Henkel." Given my druthers, I would have wanted to rewrite the script, 'cause I mean Dave Schow was a talented writer but I just felt that there were a lot of unanswered questions, a lot of needless questions the audience would come to to ask, because, like, who is this family, where do they come from? Gee, it's a pretty damn big coincidence that they happen to have a desiccated grandfather that they keep alive, too, or don't keep alive, or whatever. My concept was, hey, let's at least return to the more nasty roots and dark humor versus an overall jokey tones. First thing when I got the job, I go, "Man, this would really make it the true sequel "by having the original Leatherface back." - He talked to me about being in the film and ... we looked at the script and talked about what a mess the script was. - One of the main things was he needed a certain monetary commitment from New Line and that they weren't prepared to give, and it wasn't an outrageous thing he wanted. - It just, it was fine, I mean, it was very unlike the kind of indirect way that I dealt with Canon. I mean, he said I'll talk to the producers, he came back to me, said, "We can't pay you more than scale, "so I guess we can't have you." And I said, "Fine." I mean, it was very direct and honorable, and I had no problem with that. I was disappointed, but it just didn't work out. - What happened was we had a test screening in Burbank. So we screened the movie and it gets better ... For what-- Hey, look, it is what it is, but it got a better response than like Nightmare on Elm Street 5, the movie they just had done previously. So we had this big powwow at the end of the evening and they're just livid, Bob Shaye and this guy, Rolf Mittweg, the head of Foreign. Rolf says, "Do you realize "it'll be banned in every country? "I can't sell this movie foreign! "It's way too bloody! "It's way too offensive." Bob Shaye the next day comes in the editing room and goes "That's gone, that's gone, that's gone." So all this stuff got truncated. This is way before we even started submitting it to the ratings board. When it ran into all these ratings problems, we had resubmitted it to the ratings board many, many times to get an R. The film constantly, we were cutting the negative, because they were ... They wanted to play in theaters right away, and at that time they thought they can still make the October release date. So the negative kept getting cut. And they never did a protection negative of those effect scenes. And it was a nasty movie. It was a very nasty movie. I don't want to sound like it's a lost classic or lost masterpiece or anything. It's not. The theatrical version of the movie made me look incompetent as a director, 'cause there were scenes where, man, I directed this movie, I had no fucking idea what's going on, because you can't ... It was literally incoherent, the way they had to cut it to cut around this stuff. And I wanted my name taken off the movie. The last the last words I said to Mike De Luca. If you don't know, Mike De Luca is now one of the most powerful guys in Hollywood. The last thing I said, "I want my name off the movie." - "What do you mean you want your ... " "I want my name off the fucking movie! "I want my name off the fucking movie!" And then he hangs up. And that's the last .... (chuckles) And they couldn't take my name off the movie because they had already printed up the reel one, which obviously had the credits. Reel one was the only reel they didn't have any changes. - [Narrator] Writer of the original, Kim Henkel, directed the fourth installment in the series as The Return of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. - We felt like we could kind of revive the the film to bring it back to the spirit of the original. And I didn't really want to get involved as much as I wound up being involved, but finally let mob coon bully me into it. I want you to get almost in the same plane as her face. Your forward, looking down here. - Almost in the same plane of her face. - "What would you do this for? "What's your minimum?" So I told her. And it wasn't a lot. I mean, basically I said ... I don't know if you want the number, but I said I think as I recall, $3,500 a week, which is less than two days of what I would normally charge, plus the rights to do the documentary about the making of the film, with releases signed by all actors and crew on the first day on the set. And she came back and said, "No, that's too much, "and the offer stands at $600 a week." (sighs heavily) - If you start to feel your mask come loose or anything, let me know, okay? - Well, I ... It was happening during the scene. What was I gonna do? "Hey, my mask's loose"? - Yeah! - No! - The thing that you dream about happening happened, and then you realize it's sort of your worst nightmare because we ended up with two stars that we didn't think would be stars: Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger. - I mean, that's Vilmer's whole gig, is that he despises the straight kill. - And I think he got a big kick out of it. It was a very difficult shoot, particularly for Renee. She got beat up pretty badly, and she was a real trooper. - They had decided not to release Chainsaw until after Jerry Maguire, and they thought it would help Chain Saw when it was released, because Renee would be well known. - This is the woman who's gonna make sure I get a job in August. (laughing) - Welcome! To my home! - They said they couldn't do the theatrical release because CAA said that they did not want Matthew McConaughey exploited in that film and that they didn't believe in exploiting a known actor just to try to get a film released. And I said, "Well, I thought that's what "you guys did for living." - You're a bonafide moron. Come poking your nose around here where it don't belong. (chainsaw buzzing) - We finally ended up suing Columbia TriStar, which was probably a mistake, because they did a token theatrical release and released it in 10 theaters across the United States. (chainsaw buzzing) - [Narrator] It is the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre, however, which still holds the reputation as a startlingly original work in the history of American cinema. A print of the film resides in New York's Museum of Modern Art, and, of course, it is still held in high regard by fans of extreme cinema all over the world. - Just remember, "My families always visit me." - [Narrator] Incidentally, the house where the chainsaw family resided in the original Chain Saw has now been converted into the Kingsland Old Town Grill. When you're next in Texas, you may want to pop in for a bite to eat. (disturbing sound effects) - It was a really a shock to see it, because it's such a beautiful building, and I don't remember looking nice like this at all. And if you look up this way, this is the window that Marilyn ran out of. Yeah this is the hall where I carried Teri McMinn down. We brought Teri down this way. This was the original dining room. This is where ... the lamp here was. We had Marilyn tied here to the armchair. And then over here .... was the room with all the feathers and the bone furniture. This was the living room in the film. - I thought we were making a good movie. I always believed in that. - I think what it was trying to say is, you know, now this is America. (laughs) - It was the first time I ever worked with a bunch of college kids like. Mostly always been with with the pros. And it was fun. - And for me it was wonderful. After that I would have to go back to my real work which was I oversaw or supervised a camp for mentally retarded children and kids with emotional disturbances. And that's pretty intense. - People say, well, this is the way movies are made. Well, it's not. - If you look at all of us who worked on the film, we probably got paid less for the time we spent than if we'd gotten a job at McDonald's. - I've had a lot worse jobs. (laughs) There's a lot harder ways to really make your living, so if I had my choice I would go back and sit in that van again in a second and do it all over again. ♪ One two three four (upbeat folk music) ♪ Spend most every day ♪ In the sidewalk cafe ♪ Drinking coffee ♪ Watching women walking by ♪ The color of their hair ♪ Is not the reason that I stare ♪ ♪ But I always a fool for a blonder ♪ (scatting) - Dog will hunt!
