And now Carolina... already resembles the adolescent... that her mother was, in her younger days. Is it merely for memory's sake... or because of old men - Herodotus, Balthazar or Solomon, son of David... said to yearn for warming their souls against the flesh of maidens? Young maidens... But, no, this is a lie... Already as a child, beneath the low beams of the attic... every quiet, still and empty summer afternoon... I would re-read my red book riddled with images... of beautiful maidens with doe-like figures... slim, slender, golden... chased by dogs, forcefully caught by hunters... who handed them over, trembling, to a wistful old prince... to the wistful old prince, regretfully abandoning his golden quill... on an elusive text that still remains incomplete... and slowly contemplates in his dreams... the feverish, panting and lost prey... that is finally thrown at his feet, yes. Gracefully removing her tattered clothes. Seeing the captive laid bare, her eyes enlarged with fear. She's whipped in front of him by servants, for his pleasure. He then bathes her wounded body... caresses her, and falls asleep... cuddled up to her. In this cruel ceremony of marriage where he condemns her to death... impaled, crucified, eaten alive at his wedding feast. The last image shows her... presented on a bed of roses, with her lips slightly parted. And now Carolina must surely resemble this image from the past. This looks like it. Good, you can pack up. "Live Animal‚Äù Enough! Down, girl! If you're good, you'll get a nice bowl of soup when you arrive. She's a young dog, who is not yet very well trained. If you don't stop, you'll get a good beating. You see, she's already beginning to understand some words. PLAYING WITH FIRE Message for Georges Balthazar de Saxe. Banker. Age 47. Widow with an only daughter. Carolina. Carolina. Carolina. Carolina is in the park, reading a book. Innocent and peaceful. Right now, she's in great danger. - Who are you? Hello! - I repeat... Carolina is in the park, reading a book. - What do you want? - Innocent and peaceful. Right now, she's in great danger. Message for Georges Balthazar de Saxe... Ah Maria... go immediately... Go tell Mathias to meet me at the bottom of the garden. And as soon as possible. My respects, Sir. Your daughter, Sir, has just been kidnapped. Kidnapped. Your daughter Carolina. She is now in a safe place. In the hands, alas, of an organization both powerful and cruel. The ransom was fixed at one million dollars. In convertible currency, or petrodollars. The method of payment will be communicated by return post. The price is fixed, and no haggling. Promptness of payment is an essential condition. Otherwise, interest will be applied... on a daily basis. And also... The organization reserves the right... to utilize the economic potential of the girl... giving her to the rich clients of a special house for perverts... in which Carolina will be imprisoned to satisfy their sexual fantasies. An exhausting work that could tire her... of course, bit by bit. If the police are notified... Your daughter will be burned alive. We can guarantee a complete result, no one will find the slightest trace of her. Allow me, Sir, to show you the proof of ... the seriousness of our business. Ah, it's you, Mathias. - Sir is unwell? - It will pass. Those guys squirted... some kind of drug, right in my face. Oh. Unhappy clients... with whom Sir had made an appointment in the garden? No, you fool! The guys who were here... I don't know who they are. At least Sir knows what they wanted to obtain? Did they ask for something? No...no, they didn't ask me for anything. Ah. Well, Sir should take a rest and not worry about anything. I'll check that everything is in order. Quick! Quick! For the love of me. I can't say more. Your little Carolina Lost. Pardon me sir, but I see nothing suspicious. Tell me Mathias, at what time did my daughter leave this morning? Does anyone in the house know where she went? Miss Carolina left the house around nine o'clock. As far as knowing where she went... The simplest way is for Sir to ask her. Miss has just returned. I passed by her as I was leaving the house. As she was going up to her room. With your permission, I take my leave. Oh good, you're here. Well, yes, what's going on? Has nothing odd happened to you this morning? Odd in what sense? Did you write this on this postcard? No, why? It's in your handwriting. Yes... Oh, yes, silly me. When returning from campus... a stupid taxi driver took me on an unexpected detour. In an unknown neighborhood, we got completely stuck in traffic. Miss, could I have an autograph? Would you be able to add something to it... that would commemorate this all too brief meeting? OK, but we must hurry. It's a bit dry. Couldn't you... put for example... I don't know, "your Carolina"? Why would I do that? Let's say... for my love. And there you have it! She freely signed. That's it. Capable and recruited. All done. Carolina de Saxe is already in our hands. Details. Abducted without incident, with extreme discretion... and transported to the safest of hiding places. - Further details. - The request is turned down. All are equal before the law. Even the head. Everyone observes the autonomous responsibility of their own sector. Watertight compartments, efficiency. No risk of blabbering... and limited damage in case of accident. And that's what I say. Special instructions? No, I want daily reports. - That is your right. - Goodbye. Call Pierre Garin for me. Follow Frantz. Okay. Why? No questions. Report twice a day. On Frantz? Okay... - Carry out the mission. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Pardon me, Sir. But here's a message which arrived earlier... while Sir was in the gardens. And that I forgot because of the commotion. I should point out that this was the cause of my delay... to meet Sir. The instructions for freeing the female prisoner... will be given at the point marked with a cross on the photograph. Pardon me, Sir... but it seems to me that all of this is becoming really thrilling! It could perhaps be something serious. Perhaps there is just one coordination error in the system... and tonight... or tomorrow... So do you think that I'm really going to be kidnapped? And what will they do with me in their lair? - Hello. - Yes? Have you already participated in sadistic games? Sometimes. But not too much. What exactly? Spanking? Rather the whip. Cigarettes, quartering, nettles... swabs soaked in alcohol, and so on. I think I would prefer not to... and in any case, those things are expensive. Indeed. We'll fix the price and pocket the money. And no one will ask whether you like it or not. We will get in touch with Jo-La-Gagne, your pimp. Come on! Let's go! You will write him a nice little note right away. He'll have to pay quite a tidy sum... if he wants you returned to him alive. Only one coordination error in their system and the kidnapping will still take place. Tomorrow, today perhaps. With a slight delay. A standstill. We should take advantage of this respite... to place ourselves under police protection. So far, it's an empty threat, which I've carefully hidden. But to what end? Ah Carol... Carolina... Caroline... Given that it seems to be an empty threat for now... Thus let's take advantage of this respite to alert the police... Without wasting a moment. Four, three, two, one... zero! What happened? I wanted to burn some papers and it exploded! But why? What papers? Nothing but old stuff! And this? What is it? An old doll that I kept. A doll made of celluloid in the fire? Don't you know that it explodes? Many children have been burned alive! But I didn't throw it in on purpose... I don't know who put it in the basket... with all the papers to burn. I emptied it without looking. - You're not hurt? - No. Sure? Just a bit. A little burn. It looks like a cat's paw. And if it was something else? Inflammable stuff put there on purpose. Calm down. Don't invent unnecessary concerns. I wanted to call the police. But it is better not to for the moment. After all, you weren't kidnapped. And all of this resembles...a game. Miss! You'll be safe here. Go away! Down, boy! Now, he's gone. You can get out. In any case, he didn't seem too mean. You think so? Yes. But... he bit you? Oh no, no, only scratches from the bushes. No, it doesn't look like that at all. No, no. He must have grazed you with his fangs. Well, in any case, it's nothing very serious. Oh yes, it is. A dog that tries to bite, is always mad. You must get an injection right away. But how? Luckily for you there's a doctor right here. Don't be surprised... we came here for a duel. I must have lost my purse when I ran just now. Don't worry. You won't need it from now on. Get out of here! We don't need you anymore. One: You have been weighed in the balance, and found wanting. Two: you have lost the opportunity... to save your happiness and your power. Three: your empire, and the flesh of your flesh will perish in flames. Listen, I gave it a thought. I reckon it would be better to wait for... The gentleman you've been expecting has arrived. - Bring him in. - Right away, Sir. He's a young man you haven't met yet. He can help us with all this. Are you working on the house? No, I don't know what's happening. Carolina, could you ring please? - Sir rang for me? - Yes, Mathias. What's that racket? A thousand apologies. But it was only a minor incident from the kitchen. I allowed myself to take steps to put together a box for delivery... in order to burn it conveniently. Again! If Sir will permit, I will go see what this is about. You'll prepare yourself to please this client here. - Understood? - Yes, sir, understood. He's surely one of the key men. So make yourself beautiful... and open your eyes. Miss is scared. Well, miss is not wrong. Here's all that we know. A non- existent kidnapping... a huge ransom to be paid... a secret appointment at the most visible place in Paris. And no specific threat? No. No threat. Then it's all a joke, without a doubt. But it's best to be careful, however. You should place Miss Carolina in a safe location. No, I'd rather stay! She is safe here. I'll hire some additional bodyguards. - The house... - Is the least secure of shelters... it's obvious. Given that the kidnappers know you're here. We must find a place where nobody would think to look. An insane asylum... a prison for a political party... Or a brothel. Wait, I have an idea... I have a friend, completely trustworthy, who runs a sort of... Clinic. A place of rest for exhausted young women. It's... calm, discrete, classy, you know. Importantly, the bodyguards always watch over the safety of the clients. Whom the director of the house knows personally. Away from Carolina, I wouldn't feel calm. Naturally. But it's not your peace of mind that counts. But the protection of her own body. It's important that Carolina leaves this very evening. My friend Erika is in Paris and could accompany her. - Is this place far from Paris? - No, not too far. As an extra precaution, Carolina will dress as a boy, in one of your suits. Or rather, one of mine. By chance, I have one in my suitcase. Because I didn't have time to go home and change. Yes. The integrity of her young body. I hesitated at first. I made some objections... But finally, I accepted. Your empire, and the flesh of your flesh will perish... by fire. Can you give me a shirt, please? - This one here, Miss? - Yes, Maria. Come in. It's perfect. As if it were made for you. I'm afraid the jacket might not fit so well. Mathias, would you call a taxi? Sir doesn't take his car? No. I prefer a taxi. We need a mustache. Nothing could be easier. Ah, a fake one! Naturally. All men's mustaches are fake. - You didn't know? - No. Kidnappings are romantic. Unfortunately, it's no longer what it once was. In olden days, fair beauties were abducted by horses. Raped by swans, seduced by snakes. Torn apart by bulls... pleasures past, unfortunately. Times change. - Swans? And how did they do it? - I'll show you. She was full of attention and kindness... And I observed that she made love in a technically correct manner... but nothing more. As a memento I took the gold chain... that Carolina always wears around her waist... and that she had forgotten to put back on... after removing it to put on her trousers. "The guy that I was following... was not actually Frantz... but a younger boy wearing the same exact suit." Don't say anything. You're expected. Madame will be right down. Here, my Lady, your new little pupil. A first-class purchase. Carolina de Saxe, Erika Von Eigher. Needless to say... that this is a false name. Thank you, ma'am, for the welcome. Don't thank me. The pleasure will be all mine. The young lady should change out of her disguise. It is no longer suitable to her circumstances... now. Although, maybe... on second thought... You will find a dress to fit you on the couch in the lobby. Hurry up. ‚ÄúThe pleasure will be all mine.‚Äù Bitch. I will make you lick her pee off the floor. She'll put on her boots, and a belt to fuck you. It's good. It's so much larger in here than it appears from the outside. Yes, it's rather large. And it's... How do you say...? Who are those girls dressed in black? The residents of the house. All dressed in black? It's the custom, to better distinguish them from the servants... who wear white. Why are they so still? They're resting. Well then, will I also... always have to... - And all these doors? - Well, these are rooms. - What do they mean, these photos? - As you can see, they are portraits. And here is your room. Is she a good pupil? If she's not docile, don't hesitate to punish her. Cruelly. It's already been done. See the effects. Curtsey... I am yours, Ma'am. Your dress. Get up. Is she a real whore? Guaranteed, sir. Where's her neighborhood? Palais Royale. Her price? Third category. Undress. Immediately, Sir. Yes, it's good. You'll serve it to me with a red sauce. And flamb√© au cognac. Very good, Sir. As a side dish, a bed of tagliatelle? If you would like. Is she nice and docile? Naturally, Sir. Nonetheless, give her another injection, so that she is as soft as can be. I'll do as Sir wishes. I have everything needed right here. The doors and the corridors, photographs, keys. The names on the doors. My own photo, and my own name. I wanted to close the bolt... but it had been unscrewed during my short absence. My legs were weak and my mouth dry. I saw a bottle on a tray, which seemed to be water for the night. I drank a full glass. But I soon realized I'd made a big mistake. I beg you, young man, to hold back from performing an irreparable act. That would put in danger her... that God was placing under your protection. No acts of violence in this sacred place. Come on, let's hurry! She's gonna get quite a wedding night! Come in. Hello baby. Isn't it locked? It was removed. Removed the lock? What do you mean? It works perfectly. Oh yes, so it does. How was your night? Listen, things are going on In this house. Don't you find it bizarre? Bizarre? No. Why? It seems quiet and comfortable to me. But the people? I found it a bit... deserted, perhaps? Why do they lock me in? As a precaution, no doubt. And who gave you the key to my door? A guard, of course. But you saw the room with the portraits? Yes, I briefly saw it as I went by. It's a fun idea, don't you think? Why are you so nervous? I had a bad dream last night. There was a very strong, tall man who was washing my body. You should take a tranquilizer. I have one with me, if you want. The cane! It was not a dream. His cane is still here! Don't be silly. It's my umbrella. I put it there when I arrived. Here. Swallow, now. Now, don't be naughty! Even as a child, you already had morbid nightmares. There's no reason to worry yourself. I contacted, despite everything, your potential kidnappers. As if you really were taken from the house. I was taken. But no, you're here. So I went to the meeting place marked on the postcard. It was the first time in my life that I climbed the Arc de Triomphe... and will also certainly be the last. I should, however, take you there someday... later on... I no longer know when, nor for what reason. Now, when you were a little girl... whom I held by the hand. Sir, you also take your child for a walk? So how am I supposed to reply to this question? This idiotic phrase must be some kind of password. That those idiots didn't even communicate to me. Fine weather, indeed to visit the capital with your family. It's true, the sun, the wind, the rain, the smell of the air... the day dawns, the night falls, and so on... It so happens that I've brought a little something with me. Memento of Paris. Like the obelisk erected facing the Arc de Triomphe. And the flesh of girls offered in the secrecy of brothels. Does this bring anything to mind? Ah, thank you. I wondered where it had got to. The chain, of course. As for Carolina, alas, you know her cruel fate... and you know the price, to save her from it. Ah! You'll take a cheque? Why not a loan payment for six months, while we're at it? Cash then. Ah, that lack of trust. And in small denominations. Let's say, 10 francs. And more convenient with the current cash crisis. 500,000 bills, ten per millimeter, about... Yes, more or less... that's a column fifty meters high. That much? Of course, and very cumbersome. Not to mention the hard work involved... to obtain them discreetly. That's none of my business. I carry out orders, period. Get thinner bills, or renegotiate the deal. The orders on this point are precise. Small used bills enclosed in a bag of new cement. Deposited on a construction site... which is at kilometer K, on street X. Here is the scale map. Here, right here in niche C. Just to the right after passing door P. Got it? You know very well there's a credit crunch. I'd rather pay you in several installments. However, take this in the meantime. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. That country bumpkin. Hoping to impress me with the efficiency of his organization... forced me to accompany him to this lousy night club. In twenty seconds, the girl that you're looking at... will be called to the phone. She won't return. Is the ransom considerable? Professional secret, Mr. de Saxe. Miss Diana van der Berg wanted on the phone. Beautiful victim, don't you think? Touching and tender. For the pleasure of our sadistic customers. It's done. Capable and recruited. Come on, get up. You must be ready at seven for a difficult customer. There's still time. Do you want to be punished some more? - By you? - No, by Erika. She always invents those little things that really hurt. Remember? Yes. Only you lose, not us. There are always customers that appreciate the show. And even the ladies. Yes, I know. Don't you want to make love a little more? No, little demon, I no longer want you. Really? Then how about you rape me? Like this. My goodness, lady, what is happening to you? I wonder where this fell from. Don't scream! We will take care of this! It's done. Capable and recruited. Pretty enough, don't you think? For you Sir, special offer: 50,000. If you would like. Let go of me immediately. Or else the embassy of my country... If you like, we could put her in a more practical position. You know, it was inevitable... two or three of our men raped her. They are entitled, by contract. Unless it's a special case. I beg you, Sir. Tell them not to touch me anymore. My father will pay whatever you wish! Of course he will pay... but this doesn't stop us. Even if I admit that the show is enjoyable... I don't think it was very prudent of you to show it to me. I could recognize the places, give directions. No sir, you can't. Think of your dear little Carolina... And all the fun things that could happen to her. Burned alive, for example. But we can do better. As for this, it's a temporary haven. Perhaps tomorrow, it will no longer exist. No! Let go of me! Let go of me! If you're not a good girl we'll burn the tips of your breasts. Don't harm her too much. She must arrive at her destination... in usable condition. No! There... Shoot. Now, watch the birdie. Shoot! The client is waiting. He wants her right away, just as she is now. OK, we're coming. Hello, hello. How are you feeling today? This hotel doesn't offer many distractions... for a fashionable young lady. - No, I've no time to get bored. - The place is nice, isn't it? - Yes, very nice. So, all is well. Your father has made several visits. Yes, I mean no. One that I know of. - Do you need anything? - No, thank you. Well, all right then, I'll be leaving. I am going to have the dog rape you. Come, tell me that you love me, little girl. Ma'am, I love you. And I am your slave. Or else I'll send you out into the gardens. I'll set the dogs on you. They'll savage you to death and devour you. Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona? Sweet soul, take heed of perjury! It's death that is arriving now... like a thief. - Talk you of death, my lord? - Ay, I do! Me. Therefore, confess thee freely of thy sin. Have pity! I did not do that which they accuse me. By heaven, you did it! I saw your little panty... that he displayed like a handkerchief. I saw it! With my own eyes! Fie! Whore who cries in front of me! Drive me away my Lord. But don't kill me. Shut up now, little bitch! So kill me tomorrow. Let me live tonight. No, Desdemona I feel like it now... and it can no longer wait. Enough time remains to say one more prayer. It's too late. Not yet quite dead. And still... warm... and soft... and sweet. I don't want to prolong your torment too much. Age? Eighteen years old. Her death was recent. Oh, and still fresh. How did she die? - It was a sexual crime. - Particulars. Raped then disemboweled. By whom? By her confessor. The funeral service? Oh magnificent, it finished a few minutes ago. The burial? As soon as you are done with her. It's ready, Sir. Set fire to her. Hey, you went for a walk? Behave! Down boy. Ah yes, I'd forgotten the key earlier. Good night. Is our little prisoner getting used to her new condition? - Oh, no, sir. - All the better. A lot of our clients prefer that. - It's horrible. - Naturally. - Your distress is very enticing. - We like her very much. - Let me go, I'm begging you. - Give her one dose. - Just one? One is enough. A small quantity of revolt is nicer. Tell me what's up, don't be such a pig! Listen Pierre Garin, are you whining or playing? OK, OK, I'll play. I don't see anything tonight. Good. 50. Tell me where you've hidden the little de Saxe girl, or I'm folding. I'm not going to do your job, ok? What do you have? I am tired. And the work is too difficult. And I always end up by getting yelled at. All you have to do is tell Bonnaud that you've found it and all's well. He'll want to go see! Well, it's easy. You tell him that it's at the top of the Arc de Triomphe... and when he's on the edge... presto! You push him a little. Just below, that's where he'll find the solution. You mean the girl is already dead? No, this is a metalepsis, not a hypotyposis. And those who should understand will understand. Matthew 10:18. He didn't understand for sure. I understand only that I've run out of money. OK. We'll play something else. The girl that's being sent back to her family... We only have two hours left until the delivery. What? She's being returned? Have they already paid? No. There's an error in the quality of the goods. We have contractors devoid of merit. Luxurious standard of living, but in debt. The bank refused the payment. Oh, shit. You see, they'll blame me. I'm so sick of this. The economic climate is most unfavorable. The banks are stopping their credit. And then people are more and more depraved. In my opinion, it will end badly. I don't know what the clients have done to the girl, up at the villa. But it's nothing too orthodox. In fact, she's still a virgin. Do you want to see? Hey, lads! Bring the basket. Virgin? Very rare, today. Anyway, what a pity. Ah, on this point, I quite agree. I'm a guy of normal appetites. OK then, let's play poker. No. War. Eh? It's more up your alley. War. Unwrap. You're dogs! Nothing but sick. You bastards! Those fools must have forgotten the injection this morning. I'll get revenge. I don't need the police. I'll find that dump... and with my friends we'll blow it up. Don't be a pain. My friend has enough problems as it is. I know my folks are broke. The mansion, the Rolls-Royce... it's all a bluff. But you could have haggled a price... instead of sending me back for free. What am I gonna look like back at school? - You're studying what? - Drama. So you'll be able to act. Do you think it will be fun dealing with those stupid journalists? Don't be a nuisance! We're working here! War. That's it. My friend has won. He'll be the one to proceed with your deflowering. So you'll at least have something to tell your girlfriends. Pierre Garin...um? You are despicable! I hate you! Missionary position, but tie her well. All beautiful women, young, rich. This is the twelfth for all we know... and no one has yet filed a complaint. This suggests that there are others. Hundreds maybe. - Your informers? - Above reproach! Perhaps, chief, we should summarize the facts for the public. Naturally. I've even prepared a little note. "The script always seems the same. Acquaintances of the beautiful Young lady X or young lady Y... cease abruptly to see them in their surroundings. When friends ask for news..." - Am I reading loudly enough? - Perfectly. "When friends ask for news from the families... amazed at such an unexpected disappearance..." Huh... unexpected... ‚Äúof missed appointment... of continued absence on the phone... the father, or the husband, bring out apologies both nebulous and vague. Forced rest, unannounced trips..." The last case of which we are aware? "The last known case is that of Diana van den Berg. Called to the phone, Tuesday evening at club what's-its-name... never returned to her table... not only was it that... she..." What a way to write! Such a precious style... as if it wasn't already difficult enough to understand. "Not, only, was it that... she..." In short, "she didn't return to collect her personal belongings. Didn't even pass the cloakroom. To collect her fur coat... animal not specified." Her friends called... "Her friends called her house... Her father informs them that the girl felt unwell... and had to return home in a hurry. But this time, there are witnesses. Suspects, indeed. Yes, two. Two men, standing by the bar... who were seen watching the girl intently. Aha! They were noticed by those present. One was identified. Amazingly, it was the banker, Georges de Saxe... who would even pronounce the fateful word: ransom.‚Äù - Good, let him in. - Here he is, boss. You were by chance at time X on day Z, at club what's-its-name? Yes... that is no... Sorry, I don't remember. Don't prevaricate sir. Yes or no? Maybe in a certain respect, Commissioner... if I remember correctly. - You go there often? - No, never. Incorrect! That night you were there. So what? I mean to say that I don't frequent that kind of place willingly... Ah-ha! Then you had a special reason for going that night. Not at all, It was purely by chance. - And who were you with? - I was alone. Incorrect! You were talking with someone. - The guy sitting next to me at the bar. - And who was it? I don't know. Do you know this young girl? - No. - You've never seen her? No, never. Another thing. You possess a Cobra revolver, very rare. A bullet was discharged on the 18th in the Bois de Boulogne. From a weapon of this type. Can you bring us this item? - It's been stolen. - When? I don't know. Thank you, Sir. And if you have other news on this case... call Commissioner Loran. Al right. - Financial status? - Precarious. - Moral reputation? - Very doubtful. He's trying to get a large sum for an unknown reason. The father of van den Berg would pay anything. If his daughter has been kidnapped. Ten percent. Twelve percent. Excluding taxes. Al right. Al right. I've come to suggest a walk. Are you ready? We must always be ready here, you know. Very good, very good. Then, let's go. - Shall we walk in the house? - Oh, no, outside. - In the garden? - No, no, in the countryside. Oh, really? And the dogs? What dogs? There are no dogs. The gate isn't locked? Of course not, why would it be? As a precaution, I've been told. To only one who's a caution occurs a precaution. Ah ha, untranslatable wordplay. We can go out like this, freely? To hear you speak like that, one would take you for a prisoner. - So you've found my trail. - Happy? Yeah, sure. And little Carolina, you know where she is now? Hitchhiking down at the crossroads. She went to the inn to use the telephone. However, I don't think that she will wait long. Well then, good luck. Hello, this is Caro. Yes, we are on course. There were some accidents along the way... but overall, everything's running smoothly. Well, it wasn't possible to contact anyone this whole time. I'll have the bag of cement in an hour. Barring any unforeseen circumstances. Please tell my friends that all will be well. Oh, no! Oh, shit! Hello, Commissioner Laurent? Speaking. Georges de Saxe? I'm ringing you as you suggested. Have you made a decision? In 17 minutes exactly, I will deposit a bag containing 500 million in used bills... At such and such a place, at that precise point in time. It's the ransom for my daughter Carolina. The young lady was kidnapped? Not exactly, but the kidnappers believe as such... and they are persecuting me. I thought I'd give you the opportunity to arrest them. Very kind of you. Don't talk of it even to the Commissioner... just be on time because it's a lot of money. And money is expensive nowadays. - Police! - You're under arrest. This isn't a surprise. Nice work. Do you have your ID card? They seem in order. I'm afraid the banker's making fun of you. You've been arrested for nothing. The bills aren't small denomination? Neither small nor big. The hiding place was empty. Skinflint! - Georges de Saxe? - In person. This is Commissioner Laurent. Good morning. Well? The man who was with you at club what's-its-name has been arrested. So much the better. I was a bit offended by the fact... that you didn't put the money in the hiding place. What? We would have recovered it. We're honest police. But you haven't...? Help! Rescue! Rescue! Help me! Help! Rescue! Rescue! Help! Rescue! Help me! Died in a car accident. Which, the police claim, too closely resembles murder. The car caught fire all of a sudden... before she could get out, her hands and feet undoubtedly bound. It was my fault, in other words. What a horrible thing. Carolina. Flesh of my flesh. Destroyed in the flames. And this is therefore why my revolver... named after a serpent... was returned to me this morning, in a parcel delivered by the post. - How are you? - Not too bad. - No bruises? - No, everything went OK. Well, we got them, as expected. I didn't understand the script at all. But I think that's what it was. You have the money? The ransom? Of course. It's in the trunk. Alright then, let's go.
