I need to tell you. That place. Those people. And you'll never be any good, you'll never be anybody! You fuckin' hear me? Connolly, eat up and get your shitty little arse to school. Late as always. Had to drag him down. Such an unlikeable child. This the new boy, Alan? It is. Maitland. All going for a few drinks on Thursday. Bit of fun and games. - Got a few others coming too. - Should be a good one, Bill. Maybe we can get some nice food in then. Show 'em how it's done around here. They do like a good drink more than food, but sure, why not. Connolly! School. Now. You two, get out. Maitland. This is Mr. Howard Thomas, and this is Mr. Alan Prescott. Extremely well respected in the home. You'll treat these men with the respect that they deserve. People like Connolly, who you've just seen, he ain't capable of that. He's a deadbeat. He'll probably end up in prison. They're humanity's scum, and we don't want that for you. We want greater things from you. Whatever we ask, yeah, you do it. Whatever that is. You do it. That's the way we all get along around here. Starling and that were giving the new kid the welcome earlier. Mugs. Maitland's his name. He's gonna be in my dorm. Oh, shit! Fucking hell. - Nice coats. - Really nice coats. Not as nice as your skanky trousers, though. - His shoes. - His shit hair. Fuck off. - Give it then. - Fuck off, I said. St. Leonard's scum. Liam, you okay? That's our money, Jacko. Our food. Well, what are we gonna do? Fucking hell! - Get off. - Get off him! Come on then! Come on then! Chips? What about school?

Hold up, he's been on TV before. Known face, that one. Crimewatch, was it? She's worked you out already, Jacko. Little bit small to be a bouncer, aren't you? Cheeky bitch. You've got to show me love Heartbreaks and promises I've had more than my share I'm tired of giving my love And getting nowhere Nowhere What I need is somebody Who really cares I really need a lover A lover that wants to be there It's been so long since I touched A wanting hand - Is he bothering you? - No. It's fine.

No. - Are you gonna be sick? - No, I'm fine. I'm so fine. So fine. - How much has she had? - We're just having fun, for Christ's sake. With those idiots? That's dangerous fun, darling. And grabbing someone by the neck and threatening to beat them up, that's okay? You're pissed, sweetheart. Have a proper think about this tomorrow, yeah? Come on, get here, I'll drop you home. Oh. There you go. Come on. There we are. You all right? Hello, Mister Man. All right. There you go, mind your head. All right? You in? Mind your feet. Ooh! Thank you. Belts on. No "thank you" then? You know what? I know men like you. Antagonizers. Intimidators. Narcissists. If I knew those words, I might agree with you, darlin'. It's not a bloody joke. I can't afford to… No, my career can't afford to get involved in this petty shit. Street fights are so bloody classless. I was the one fucking off home tonight, darling, and I stopped to help you with your shit. Yours, not mine. Yeah, exactly! My concerns, my problems, my life. You all right, Luce? I should've just left you and your wasted fat friend to it. - She's not fat. - Fucking chubby, though. He hit you, sweetheart.

Just… yes, that's it, thank you. Thank you. I do mean that. So this ain't going nowhere then, no? I doubt it. Can't see them reporting it, they're cowards. You'll be fine, Jacko. I meant us. You know Jim's caff on the high street? Uh… Uh, yeah, I think so. Meet me there tomorrow if you really meant that thank you. - 30. All right, Luce? Time to go home, come on. Okay? There you go. Okay? Paul. So, that's two large breakfasts, extra mushrooms and extra bacon on one, yeah? - Extra sausage.

Please, can you help me? You never help me! Please! - Actually, is there any sugar? - Yeah. Can we get some sugar over here, please, sweetheart? - Breakfast is nearly ready, Jacko. - Thank you. Please, Mummy! Stop it! I fucking told you to stop it. - This place is authentic. - Yeah, proper grub too, you'll see. There you go. Smashing. Can we get some brown sauce with that, please? - Yes, darling. - Thank you. Look, sorry, Jacko, um… I fucking told you to stop that! - Oi! Take it easy, yeah? - What's it got to do with you? - Don't slap the kid. - I'm sorry. She yours? Fuckin' some people. Don't know what that shit does. Yeah, look, sorry, Jacko. I'm gonna have to go. I can't eat this, I'm too hungover, and I've got to get to work. - At least finish your coffee. - No. Thanks again for last night. Uh, this is all I've got, sorry. I'll see you around, yeah? Anthea. And you'll never be any good, you'll never be anybody! You fuckin' hear me? - Hello, boys. How are you today? - Bag of chips, mate. - Salt? Vinegar? - Yeah. "Please" is the word. Let's see your money then. Here. - You're short, boys. - What? No, we ain't! I'm joking with you. I was talking about your height. Mug. Oi! Do you want these chips or not? Sorry, mate. He didn't mean it. We're just hungry, ain't we, Liam? It's your friend you wanna have a word with, lad. - Mug! - Oi! Here, pass us the loaf. Here. I wish we could have this every day. Same here. Starling wouldn't let it, would he? Wanker. When we make it pro, we could have this every day, though, eh, Liam? Boxers don't eat chips, you mug. They eat steak. Every meal. Every day. Just steak, Jacko. I'm gonna wear red and white shorts when I make it. Proper smart. It'll make Alan and Cathy proud, eh? We could pay for 'em to sit right at the front, watch us become champs. I'll be the middle-weight champ and you'll be the skinny-runt champ. Don't think I'll grow much more, you know. Jacko, it's okay, 'cause we think big. We'll make it big and we'll get lots of money. - We'll get the fuck outta here. - We'll buy a place and live together. - And we'll get all the girls. - All the girls. Paul. - Mr. Connolly? - Yeah, who's asking? I'm DCI Mayer and this is DI Clements. Do you have five minutes? What for? We need to talk to you about your time in St. Leonard's Children's Home. I've had my fill of you lot lately, to be honest. So we've heard, Mr. Connolly. We have called by a few times, but unfortunately you've been out. We've got some information that's going to come as a shock to you, so it may be beneficial if you take a seat. What's this about, love? Take a seat please, Mr. Connolly. Okay. You got me worried now, you two have. We need to talk to you about a very sensitive subject matter. It's regarding your old children's home, St. Leonard's. You said, what about it? It's been part of a large-scale investigation. With regards to the alleged child abuse that happened there. The investigations, whilst still ongoing, have uncovered some, quite frankly, extremely disturbing facts. We're here to inform you that six of your eight housemates from St. Leonard's are now unfortunately deceased. What the fuck are you talking about? Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm talking about children in your dormitory. Children that you grew up with at St. Leonard's. Yeah, I do, but six? How? Regrettably, over the years, the six individuals took their own lives. They committed suicide, Mr. Connolly. We know this isn't an easy conversation, Mr. Connolly, but we need to inform you of all the facts. I'm afraid I have to tell you that another child in your care home, Liam Carroll, has also recently taken his own life. Liam? We were like brothers, he would… I'm so sorry, Paul. As far as the investigation proving fruitful in terms of securing custodial sentences, the investigation didn't yield the results we thought it might. Two of the three main alleged perpetrators received far more lenient sentences than we were hoping for, or expected, and that was totally out of our control, Mr. Connolly. Do you understand? We're telling you, because soon it's going to be on national television and in all forms of the media. Yeah? We need to make you aware of the facts of the case… …and the up-and-coming media exposure, but most of all we need to protect you… Do you understand what we're saying, Mr. Connolly? Mr. Connolly? Why do ya think they do that, take the piss? Dunno. Do ya think Starling's right? We're nothing? Scum? - They're always saying it, ain't they? - Don't know, Paul. Just leave it. Okay. - Well, I don't think we are. - Just fucking leave it, Jacko. Come on. It's all right, Jacko. It's gonna be all right, mate. - Hello, Jacko. - How do ya find me? I'm a policewoman, need I say more? Sorry about the mess. It ain't normally like this. Thanks. You not joining me then? Look, can I put some music on or something? Lighten the mood, just… it's not really going how I thought it might. - Yeah, if you want. - Yeah? These are surprisingly well ordered. Oh, my God, Jacko, you are gonna have to dance with me. No.This is one of my favorite songs ever. I can't believe you've got this. Why? Someone like me don't like good music? Hmm… How can you leave me Darling, how can you go? You're gonna have to dance with me, Jacko. Nah. When in your heart you know That I worship the ground You walk on Oh, baby Don't you walk on me How can you hurt, hurt me After all we've been through? Please don't desert me, baby I'm begging you 'Cause I worship the ground You walk on Oh, baby Don't you walk on me You're the only thing That makes my life Makes my life worth living Baby, baby Baby, can't you see, can't you see I need you with me? Yeah Yeah, yeah How can you hurt me After all we've been through? Please Don't desert me, baby I'm begging you 'Cause I worship the ground You walk on Oh, baby Don't you walk on me 'Cause I worship the ground You walk on Oh, baby Don't you walk on me Paul. And you'll never be any good, you'll never be anybody. You fuckin' hear me? Nice, that's it. One, two. Jab. Hook. Jab. - Hello, boys, how are we? - Hi, Cathy. What's up, little 'un? He's in a bit of a strop, ain't ya? It's all right, Alan. He'll cheer up now Cathy's here. - Won't you, Paul? - Liam, I didn't say that. Jacko said he's gonna marry you, Cath. Oh! Jacko, that's sweet. Look, can we just get on here? We're meant to be learning discipline, not talking about someone marrying my missus. Guard up, Jacko. You lads need a bit of food sorting? Cath! - Steak please, Cath. - Cheeky git. Not even I get that, fella. Come here, Paul. It ain't about size. It's about power, technique, speed. Most of all, most of all, belief. Mental attitude, Jacko. You've got to believe it and you can do it. 'Cause you're Jack the Lad, ain't you? Huh? Right, let's go. Go on, Jacko. Pretend it's your friend Starling. Fuck off, Liam. Head down, keep those hands up, boy. Hold it! Stop! Fucking hell, boy. Calm it, Paul. Calm it. Calm it. - Wake up. Wake up. - What? You gotta go. What's up? You gotta leave, Anthea. You kidding me? You're actually serious? Jacko! I'll call you tomorrow, yeah? You really are a piece of work, aren't you? Oh, Christ. Got what you wanted, did you? Shagged a copper. Fuck you, Jacko. But now, we move across live to the Old Bailey for breaking news on the St. Leonard's historical child abuse investigation. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Inspector David Melley said Operation Mapperton had unveiled a harrowing tale of systematic child abuse at the St. Leonard's children's home in the idyllic Essex countryside. The lifting of reporting restrictions at the Old Bailey meant that the full scale of the abuse could be, if not exposed, then at least hinted at and the conspiracy of silence that had ruined many children's lives over many years could finally be drawn to a close. It's reported that, out of the 3,000 children thought to have passed through the home's doors between 1965 and its closure in 1984, that as many as 70 may have been ritually abused at the home. However, police believe that those figures indicating the number of victims are extremely likely to be inaccurate and potentially do not represent the full extent of the abuse. It's Jacko, leave us a message. Hello, Jacko? Jacko, you there, boy? Come on, pick it up if you're there. Yeah, it's been a while since I've seen you, boy. Been too long really. Well, it'd be good to talk, boy, catch up with things, eh? We'll have a nice cuppa. This is Anthea. Please leave a message. Thanks. Anthea, it's Jacko. Anthea, pick up, it makes this easier to say. Look, I was a total prick the other night, and I'm sorry. There's a lot going on at the moment, and I'm trying hard to change things, it's just not easy. It's not… it's not fucking easy. Um… So, I need you to be patient, and if you do like me that sort of way, then… uh… I dunno, I just need to get out of London for a day, so will you come? Tomorrow or soon. Uh… Yep, that's it, really. Okay. Bye. Keith. Thomas. Robert. Jason. Terry. Andrew. I need to tell you. Hello, beautiful. Hi, Jacko. Thank fuck you're here. Long old drive to be sat here on my tod all day. Yeah, well, after the horrible way you treated me the other night, almost didn't come. To be honest, a day out of London is what attracted me. A day away from all the crap. So be warned, this is your last chance, okay? I'll make today count. That's a Jacko promise. Even in this shit. Yeah, we picked a good day for it, didn't we? - What should we do? - I know a place. Ain't far. I'm not sure If you realize But I'm fond of you But I'll keep it to myself 'Cause I probably think of you More than you'd want me to But I'll bask in the light That shines on me When I think of you You're my holiday You're my perfect distraction You're my holiday Oh, ooh Fish and chips? You're my holiday Lovely. Thank you. You're my perfect distraction You're my holiday Oh I'm not sure If you realize That I'm quite fond of you I'm quite fond of you Today's been good, right? Yeah, it has. You surprise me. - I used to love these as a kid. - I can tell. What were you like as a kid? A bit of a tearaway. Why doesn't that surprise me? Go on, what did you get up to? No. That's a "don't go there, Anthea" if ever I heard one. I'm not used to that. What? The truth. Listen. All right, Jacko? Where you been? Not seen you all day. Saw Starling and that go to the pub earlier. Yeah, me too. Cunts. There they are. Wankers. If you could, would you kill Starling? Not just him, all of 'em. They all fucking deserve it. - I'd want 'em to suffer, though. - Yeah, same. I'd strangle the bastards, just to see their eyes fucking pop, and I'd laugh, I'd laugh right in their fucking faces. - No! - Get over here, now! - Stay here, yeah? - No! Stop! Stop running, boys! One, two, three… - Do as I say, boy! Listen! - …four… Let's go, Jacko. Come on! Hurry up! You boys, get in here! Fuck off! Fuck off, I'll stab you! Fuck off! Get in here. - Get in here! - No! Get up! Come on then, let's have a bit of fun. Please stop! I don't want to! Jacko. All right, boy? Malkie. It's good to see you. Finally we made it happen, eh? Can't understand what I'm doing on your doorstep, though, 'cause you know I'm not the sort of geezer who likes to get out and about. How you doin' anyway? You all right? I'm okay. Is that right? You really don't look okay. Can I get you anything? Help in any way? I'm fine, thank you. Well, that's good. That's very good. It means you can be doing me a little favor on Saturday night, don't it? I got work later on, gotta be fresh for Sunday too, Malk, I can't. What? Well, good old Vince has agreed to help me out and he don't know me half as well as you do, boy. We don't have half the history. Seems a little bit odd, that. - I gotta be fresh. - It's an all-nighter. Won't get in the way of your plans, or your Sunday work, or whatever it is. It's in the middle of the two, perfect fit really. - Couldn't have planned it better. - I'm done with all this shit. I just got off a ten stretch, for fuck's sake. Well, yeah, but that was your fault, wasn't it, boy? Bit too heavy handed, weren't you? You forgotten how far we go back, boy? What we seen? What we done? Eh? Oh, Jacko. Vince tells me you're seeing a rather lovely young lady now, is that right? - Yeah. - Uh-huh. Then you will understand that these fucking Africans are getting a little bit too much. They're taking the piss, you know that, with my business. Kicking in my doors, raping and beating my girls and stealing my fucking money. That's very much not on. All girls need protecting, Jacko, so you and Vince are gonna straighten 'em out. I don't want them fuckers kicking my doors in and hurting my girls no more. Do you understand me? Rape? Yeah, and that's the best they've been doing to some of 'em, Jacko. Wouldn't want that happening to your little lady, now, would we? Are you beginning to understand me? This ain't no tit-for-tat, Jacko, this is moral through and through. You know you don't treat women like that, right? I taught you well, didn't I? Course. Yeah, well, then you will understand it's the right thing to do. You've always had that about you, Jacko, I'll give you that, yeah? Besides, be a proper little earner for you, won't it, eh? Eh? Take that little tart of yours out, can't you? Any way you like, Jacko, I don't care how. You just straighten these pricks out once and for all, do you understand me? Eh? Every man's got his breaking point, and I've just about reached mine. Wait. I'll do it, but I need some information. I need to find some people. Yeah, all right, Jacko. You just answer your phone, all right? And get inside, it's cold. Fucking hell, Vince! Need help with that, Jacko? Shut it. You scared the fucking shit outta me, you mug. You ready, or what? Yeah. Let's get this done, yeah? - Hello, darling. - Marla. Been awful lately, lads. Only last week, Pelly's place got broken into. Her place is a mess. Most of her girls have moved on. Got my girls bloody terrified here. Worried we're next. You don't know how grateful we all are. I've made all the girls stay in their rooms tonight, boys too. - Girls, the boys are here. - All right, girls. No more problems after tonight. That's a Jacko promise. - Eggs and chips, is it? - Cass, fry him an egg, will you? Yes, and a cuppa, darling, two sugars, please. Vince, before you get too settled in, I want you to come keep watch of the street with me for a bit. We've heard they're in the area and we've got to be careful. Swap with Jacko when your food's ready.Sure. Jacko! They're outside. Vince spotted 'em. Shut the fucking door. Don't come out, lock it, yeah? Let's fuck 'em up, Jacko. Keep the food hot, girls. Cunts! Don't fuck with Malkie Brooks, got it? Or any of his girls or property, right! What was that? Fucking rapists, Jacko. Rapist cunts! You happy with that? Fucking mug. No… Whoa! Stop! Fuck 'em up, don't kill 'em. Okay? Yeah. Up the fucking stairs. Get in that fucking room. Fuck. Fuck! Jacko? Oh, my God. What the hell happened? Are you okay? Go back to sleep, it's all under control. Jacko! Jason, Robbie, Jason, Terry, Andrew, Keith, Jason, Robert… Terry, Jason, Andrew… Keith, Tommy… Fuck. Liam, you okay?

Why the screaming and sweating in your sleep? Give me something. Anything… and I will stay. 'Cause right now I don't know whether to run or stay, Jacko. You standing there like a little boy lost is turning what we could be into shit. Do you hear me, Jacko? Yeah. God. What am I doing? Connolly! Maitland here was a lot of trouble the other night. Did you know that, Connolly? - No, sir. - No. He didn't do as he was told. He needs to learn, yes? Then get your tiny little prick out, and piss on the worthless cunt. You heard Mr. Thomas. Piss on him. I said piss on him, Connolly. No. Who do you think you are? You ain't nothing, boy. Nobody loves you. You hear? You'll end up in prison, you. You're fucking dirty scum.

The former house parent was found guilty of 19 offenses including rape, buggery and indecent assault. Starling's victims included ten girls and one boy as young as five over the 20-year period at St Leonard's. The home's superintendent, Alan Prescott, 62, described as "a pillar of his local community," received a two-year sentence after admitting indecently assaulting four boys in his care between 1970 and 1980 while he was superintendent of a Tower Hamlets children's home… Come on! Welcome, everyone. So, as you can all see, there's a list of potential suspects. A fair few on there. Seven to be exact. But they are all capable of this kind of violence. They've been there, done that. We're treating this as attempted murder. However, we have zero intelligence and zero witnesses surrounding it at present. Obviously it doesn't help that the victims refuse to speak, due to potential reprisals. So if we can't act quickly with definitive descriptions of the attackers from other intelligence, then we're going to struggle with this, and to be honest, that worries me. What I can say is, we need these scum off the streets, and justice needs to be served. A third alleged pedophile, Howard Thomas, also 62, had the case against him dropped after police lost vital video evidence from alleged victims taken during an earlier, aborted, investigation, and the defense successfully argued that without this he could not be guaranteed a fair trial. Mr. Thomas was acquitted of 12 charges. This is Anthea, please leave a message…Hello? This is Anthea, please leave… Anthea, why aren't you picking up? Hello? Have I done something?
