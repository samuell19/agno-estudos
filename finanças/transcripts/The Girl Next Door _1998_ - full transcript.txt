(calm music) (birds chirping) (calm music) (calm music) (calm music) - Good morning, Dr. Bradley. - Hey Fiona. - Great day. - Sure is. - I didn't know you were a morning person. - This week I take step class at the community center. Today was it. - Oh. 'Cause you're all warmed up, how about giving me a run for my money? - No, I'm going home. - All right. - See ya. - Bye. (calm music) - Hey you. - Who's that? - Your folks gone yet? - Corey. - Well, are they? - No, and it's none of your business. - Hey, I just thought you'd be getting hot for it, you know? - Ugh. - It's not like we've never done it in the woods before. - Corey. - Come on, Fiona. - Don't touch me. - Hey, we've gotta talk, straighten things out. - I'm straightened. I liked you, now I don't anymore. - Just 'cause I wanna see more of you. - No, because you think you own me, which you don't. - Come on, babe. - Don't call me babe. In fact, don't call me anything anytime. - Bitch. (bells tolling) - Chief Larson. - Howard, what can I do for you? - Well, returning my phone calls would be a good start. (Larson laughs) - That's good. - Look, we go to press tomorrow and I need an update on the investigation of the stalker. - You mean the person or persons who've been peeking into a couple of women's windows? - Yeah, one of the victims being your own officer, Colleen Hinshaw. - Victims, you make it sound like we're looking for the Boston strangler. But I guess that's what sells papers, doesn't it? I want you to have a nice evening, and I know your story's gonna work out fine. - What's the problem Howard? The usual? - Yeah, we've got an ostrich for a sheriff, who likes to hide his head in the sand. (Steve laughs) (dog barking) (birds chirping) (bell tolling) - I think I'm gonna turn in, you coming? - No, not yet. How are you feeling? - Like Moby Dick, beached. (Arthur laughs) I'll be glad when this bundle of joy is delivered. Are you all right? - What? - You seem so preoccupied lately. - Really? I haven't noticed. - That's what I mean. Is it anything to do with the baby? - Mm, no. I want it. I think about it all the time. - It? - The baby. - Do you think we made a mistake? Maybe we left it too late. - You're going to deliver a very healthy baby, Mary. - It isn't the baby I was worrying about, Arthur. (bright upbeat music) - Need anything while I'm away? - Nope, just remember how good I am at faking your signature. - Oh, by the way, Jack Hargrove is gonna be coming to do some work on the pool pump while I'm away. - I hate that man. (phone ringing) - If that's Corey, tell him I've gone to bed. - Hello? Hello? Oh, hi Jim. What's up? Fiona, turn it off. Uh-huh. ♪ As long as you got, got the money ♪ (bright upbeat music) That's ridiculous, who said that? (bright upbeat music) Joyce might like it. Okay, okay, I'll get her to vote. - Well, if I can't sleep tonight, I won't be able to play the happy mayor's tomorrow. - Why don't you just tell dad that you don't wanna go on these trips with him? I'm sure that he would understand. - Life's not that simple. There are expectations. - [Len] What the hell does he mean that Glen Haven doesn't have the right visitor profile? - I knew we wouldn't get through the evening without somebody calling about that stupid casino license. - [Len] If he approved the license there'd be hotels and restaurants built in no time. - I'm saying there are expectations. - [Len] Okay, I'll be with you as soon as I get there. - Is that what life's about mom? Doing everything that's expected of you, even though it's eating you up inside? - [Len] Nah, forget it. I'll call you when I get there. Goodnight. - I'm fine. - Joyce, Jim says several members of the license committee think Glen Haven is to rinky dinky for casino. Honey, we're gonna have to take the chairman for dinner while we're there, an expensive dinner. It never hurts to kiss ass as long as you kiss the right one. (pills clatter) - Shit. - [Len] Honey, remind me to call Steve Vandermeer in the morning before we go. It's important. (bright upbeat music) - [Announcer] Anderson Group on the first tee. - Good luck Mr. Mayor, there are tons of people relying on you. - Don't remind me. - Oh and by the way, I'll be in court all week if you need me. Take care, Arthur. - Steve. - Hi, Arthur. - Len? How's it going? - Not bad. I need some help. I'm a little bit worried about Joyce. I need her on this trip but I'm afraid of her falling apart. It's very Vogue these days for wives to be visible and active. - Well, why don't I give her a call, try and see her before you leave? - That'll be great. But for God's sakes don't let on we've talked. - About what? - Another favor? I don't know how long we'll be gone, but could you keep an eye on Fiona? She'll be alone in the house and frankly I'm worried about Corey. Could you be the watchful neighbor? - Well, I can try. (clock ticking) (phone ringing) - [Voicemail] Hi, you've reached the Winter's house. You know the routine. Leave a message and we'll call you back. (phone beeps) - [Corey] Fiona, it's Corey. I know you're there. Come on Fiona, pick up the phone. Fiona, I thought you hated games. (phone clicks) - Hi. - Hi. Now, remember just two before bed otherwise you might start telling people what you really think of Langley. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Joyce laughs) I'll make sure she's a good girl. - All right. - Now here's the front door. I've laid down the ground rules for Fiona, so I don't think she'll give you any trouble. Now, Jack Hargrove is gonna be doing some work in the pool. I don't want him around Fiona. - Well, don't worry. I'll take care of it. You just go off and have a great trip. - Thanks, Arthur. - All right. - For everything. - You're welcome. You'll be fine, Joyce. Just make sure you get some sleep. - You bet, okay? Thanks again. Hey Arthur- - Len! - God, there is Howard. - Len! - He's a busy body. He'll be busy body even going to the bathroom. We're going outta here. (all laughing) (birds chirping) - Fiona? Fiona? - [Fiona] Get back here you little tramp! (girls giggling) I'm the president of the United States, you cannot turn me down. Come back! (Vicky gasps) - Hello girls. - See, Dr. Bradley? I'm a man. (Vicky giggles) - Well Fiona, that requires a little more imagination than I've got. No thanks. (indistinct) - Well, I'm a little shy in front of cameras. - A good looking man like you? - Your father did provide me with some rules. - Ha, the 10 commandments; Thou shall not have a party. - Thou shall be in bed by midnight, yada yada. - And thou shall honor Dr Bradley as if he were thy father, and call him if there's a problem. - Wow, sounds like you know the rules. Goodbye. (calm music) (crickets chirping) (calm music) (calm music) (calm music) (calm music) (water splashing) (foreboding music) (phone rings) Hello. Yeah, well just stay inside and I'll be right over. - What is it? It's Fiona, she thinks there's someone in her backyard. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - [Fiona] Anything? - Nope. (dog barking) - I swear, it wasn't my imagination. I heard something, I really did. - Yeah, well it could have been anything. Do you wanna sleep at our place tonight? I can set up the guest bed. - No, I'll be fine. - You sure? Okay. - You're not just gonna leave, are you? - Why, what do you want me to do? - Stay, at least for a little while. (water bubbling) Can I ask you something? - Sure. - Is my mom nuts? - No. Why would you think that? - All those pills she takes, and sometimes I catch her crying. - Well, your mother's a little anxious and maybe a little depressed. It's not uncommon in middle age. - How come? - Well I'm a family practitioner, Fiona. I'm not a psychiatrist. - Yeah, but you know about people. - Well, as our lives go along, we... Well some people become sad simply because their lives aren't as fulfilling as they expected. They feel caught in their own circumstances. - Like a crummy marriage. - Well, there are all kinds of disappointments. - I bet you're happily married. - Yeah, I guess. I mean, I got nothing to compare it to. - What do you mean? - Well, Mary was my first girlfriend. - Go on. - Well, we met at university and I've never been with anyone else. It's pretty dull, huh? (calm music) - That is so totally cool. - Yeah. (calm music) (calm music) - Is she all right? You were gone quite a while. - Yeah, she's fine. Oh yeah.

I told you there's nothing else to talk about. There's no one else here. Just stop calling me. Stop calling me. - Corey? Thought so. - Relationships suck. - Not all of them, Fiona. - It's easy for you to say, you have a good one. - Hmm. - Not that you have anything to compare it with. - That's right. (calm music) (dramatic music) (thunder roaring) - [Fiona] Did you always wanna be a doctor? - No, no. Until I went to university, I wanted to be a writer. A novelist. - Really? Did you write one? - Well, I tried. But I was only 19 years old, so I discovered I didn't really have all that much to say. Tangible deficiency. (Fiona chuckles) - I bet you have a lot to say now. - Oh, I don't know. I don't know. - So what made you wanna become a doctor? - Mary, Mary's dad. My own practical nature. I've never been terribly daring. - Are you gonna be one of those people who's sad in middle age? - Absolutely. - I think that I'm gonna be very sad. - Why? - Because I'm not very good at anything. I think that I'll probably have to marry someone like Corey and end up like those women at the country club, getting by on tranquilizers. (thunder roaring) - The truth is most of us would prefer having our decisions get made for us. - Why? - Well, because then we don't have to take the blame for our own lives, that's why. You know it's been said this self isn't worth examining because there isn't anything to say about it. (calm music) - I think that you're just trying to be helpful. (phone ringing) (calm music) (phone ringing) (calm music) (rain pattering) Help me. Hold me.

I am a supposedly mature doctor and you are the daughter of my friend. - I'm just a kid, is that what you mean? - No, no. I have to go home. - Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. It was wonderful, that's all. - Fiona... God, I have to go. - Oh, I have no idea. As soon as Arthur gets back I'll... (door opens) Hold on, that's him. - Arthur, it's Len on the phone, for you. - Hey Len. - Look, sorry to be calling you, but it's Fiona. We've been trying to call her but the phone just rings and rings. - Oh, she's probably asleep. - Yeah, probably, but you know how it is. - Well, when I stopped by there earlier on today she was fine. I do know Corey's been pestering her, so she might have unplugged the phone. - That sounds like Fiona. Arthur thinks she unplugged the phone. Corey again. - God. - Listen, why don't I stop over there and make sure everything's all right. And I'll give you a call if anything's amiss so you and Joyce can get some sleep. - Thanks pal. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (pensive music) (pensive music) (line ringing) It's me. Your father called, he wanted to know if everything was all right. Are you all right? Well good, good. Goodnight. (pensive music) (pensive music) (knocking on door) - Good morning. - Good morning. - I was wondering if you were going to church today. If I could get a ride. - Of course you can. - [Fiona] Thank you. (bells tolling) - Fiona, Arthur tells me that Corey Vandermeer has been harassing you. - It's no big deal. I wouldn't be scared if my mom and dad were home. - Still, no woman should have to put up with bullying. - I feel safe with you and Dr. Bradley right next door. - Well good, I'm glad. - Mrs. Bradley, I was thinking that since you're not feeling the best these days, maybe I could come over and make dinner tonight. - That's very sweet of you, but I'm not an invalid. - Just a thought. (calm music) - It looks like it might just be an ear infection. Are you experiencing any dizziness? - No. - I'll send the swab to the lab, I need a positive identification anyway. And your blood pressure is not coming down. Any unusual stress lately? - Stress is my middle name. I thought running a small town paper would put an end to it, but. - There are lots of medications to control blood pressure, Howard. - I don't like pills. Can I put on my shirt? - You bet. (phone ringing) Excuse me. Dr. Bradley. (calm music) He's coming to fix the pool today. What time this afternoon? Yep. Yep, I can be there. Hm-hmm. Yeah, goodbye. - Vicky tells me your babysitting Fiona Winters. - (indistinct) babysitting, Howard. - Right. Still, it's not a good time for her to be in that house alone. - Yeah, maybe, maybe. - We done here? - You're a little out of shape, Howard. - I'll go on a diet. - All that junk food and the office hours you're keeping up aren't good for you. - I know. I know, I know, I know. - I'd like to schedule some tests. - I don't have time. Bye-bye Arthur. - Howard, you have to make time. (calm music) Hello Jack. - Yeah. - Len asked me to come and check on the pool repairs. - Well, I replaced the cracked pipe. But there's still mud in the system. - [Arthur] Which means? - Well, I'll have to come back and backwash the system. - [Arthur] Was that in the estimate? - Well, I'll have to bill for an extra hour. It'll foul the pump if I don't do it. - Dr. Bradley, can I see you for a minute? - Yeah, okay. Just send that part of the bill to me. (calm music) - [Fiona] Thanks for coming. - [Arthur] Of course. - I've been thinking about Saturday night. - So have I, Fiona. But probably not quite the same way you have. I think it might be better if we both tried to forget that it happened. - Why would I wanna forget it? It was really special to me. - I'm a married man, and soon to become a parent. - But the desire was real, wasn't it? - Yeah. Yes, it was real. You are a very desirable young woman. (enchanting music) Fiona, we can't... We can't ever... I mean, what kind of future would we have? - I've finished, you wanna sign for this? - Yeah. (upbeat music) - Just admit it, you (indistinct). - No, it's none of your business. - All I know is (indistinct). - You don't know him. - I know everybody. (upbeat music) - Arthur? - Hmm? - I can't sleep with that racket. - Yes, I can hear it. - Well, it's a weeknight. It's very late. Len and Joyce won't want Fiona waking the neighborhood, not to mention me. One of us is going to shut it down. (upbeat music) - Can you turn that down? Can you turn that down? Thank you for that. I'm sorry, but it's past midnight. This party is over. - Says who? - Orders from Fiona's father. And you better not be driving. - He's right, Dr. Bradley's in charge of this house. So, sorry. - [Woman] See you, Fiona. - Please come with me. No! - [Man] Corey, come on! - [Man 2] Bye! - [Man] (indistinct) into your Jeep. - I don't need this. (car engines starting) - Did we wake up Mary? - Yep. - Sorry. (pensive music) Will you stay for a while? - I don't think so. (pensive music) - Please. (pensive music) - Why don't you go to bed. (pensive music) (car engine revs) (clock ticking) (clock alarm chiming) (crickets chirping) (dog barking) - Arthur? Oh, something's wrong? Arthur? - Yeah. (monitors beeping) (oxygen concentrator hissing) (dramatic music) Everything's fine, you're gonna be okay. - The baby. - Yeah, she's fine too. Hello Howard. - What are you doing here? - Well, we had the baby and I came to place a birth announcement. - You haven't heard. - About what? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Arthur clears throat) (dramatic music) Full rigor's set in, she's been dead for hours. - Five will get you 10, she was strangled. The county coroner will tell us if she was raped. (dramatic music) Do you have any idea who might have done this to her? - No. I mean, I do know she was fighting with Corey Vandermeer. - Oh, Steve's boy? - Yeah. - Although I can't imagine. - Oh God, Len and Joyce. - They're on their way back. It's my guess that she let her assailant in. She knew him. (dramatic music) There's some stains on the couch, Arthur. We wanna do a DNA check on those, they look like semen stains. - Yeah. Do you mind if I get outta here? - No, go ahead. Thanks, Arthur. (Larson sighs) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Get it over to forensics as fast as you can. (dramatic music) - What's the story Arthur, Larson won't say. - Fiona's dead, Howard. - I know that. The king is dead doesn't tell me a lot, but the king is dead 'cause there's poison tells me plenty. Please talk to me. - She was murdered, I think. (dramatic music) (melancholic music) (Joyce crying) (melancholic music) (pensive music) (pensive music) (birds chirping) (vacuum whirling) - Arthur. - Don't mean to intrude, Len. - Not at all. Come in, please. - Joyce. Listen, I can't begin to find words to express the... Uh, to tell you how very, very sorry I am. - You were supposed to be taking care of her. How could you let this happen? - Joyce. - How could you? - Joyce, please. (Len sighs) It's all right, Arthur. You weren't expected to watch her day and night. - Yeah. - Next to us, you're probably suffering more than anyone. Thanks for coming over. Not having anyone to talk to, it's hard. It's very hard. Howard Poolin phoned today, wish he hadn't. His daughter told him Fiona was seeing someone. Who? She doesn't know. - Len? There's something I want to talk to you about. - Arthur, I have an idea where this is going. I know. - Well- - Joyce found them, it's okay. Fiona was on the pill. Like they say, fathers are always the last to know these things, right? - Yeah, well, sometimes. It was only few months ago- - No, I understand. You were her doctor, you're entrusted with these decisions. I'm sure you had Fiona's best interests in mind. Larson seems to think this was not a stranger related crime. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. - That Fiona knew whoever it was. That whoever she would... Whoever she was seeing may in fact... Could explain her murder. - Yeah. (Len crying softly) - So you wanted to get back together again, but she wasn't having any. Okay. Look at me, Corey. - [Steve] Where is he? - You don't have any idea who the new guy was, she'd been seeing? Steve, this is an official interview. - Yeah. Well I'm not here as his father, I'm here as his lawyer. Corey, have you told him anything? - Just that I didn't do it. - Good boy. - I need to clear up some important questions and we need a blood test from your son today. - We're not providing a squat, Roy. Do you have anything on him? - This is just in an interview. - Are you pressing charges? (Larson sighs) - Not yet. - Then this interview is over. Come on, Corey. You know the rules. (dramatic music) Len, let me assure you that there is no way that Corey killed Fiona. I can smell fear, and that boy is scared rigid. Roy just thinks of him as a bucket of hormones with no brains. I think he's fishing. - [Len] Could be. He told me it might be somebody new Fiona was seeing. He says, find the man and you get the killer. - [Steve] That sounds even more like fishing to me. But I understand he sent some stuff in for DNA testing. Any idea what? - [Len] No, no idea. - Len, I'm not gonna let Roy Larson make Corey the scapegoat. Hi there, Arthur. How you doing? - Hi Steve, I'm all right. - How's the baby? - Oh, she's fine, she's great. - Mary? - She's fine, she's gonna spend some more time in the hospital. She needs some rest. (Steve chuckles) - Doctor's orders, eh? - Hm-hmm. - You look worn out. - I'm not getting very much sleep. - Why don't you prescribe yourself something? You know, Arthur, it wasn't your fault. - Yeah, I know. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Arthur, I know the confidence between a doctor and patient but can you tell me anything about Fiona's sexual activity? - Well, I can tell you that she was on the pill. - When you took Mary to the hospital, what time did you depart? - It was about 1:15. - 1:15, huh. Well, I know Fiona was killed sometimes between midnight and 2:00 AM. - Any of the neighbors hear anything? - No, not a thing. Forensics found some thread underneath one of her fingernails and some more on a bush over near the pool. A common dyed thread used to make wind breakers. She probably pulled it out when she was fighting him off. - Yeah. - A green wind breaker. (dramatic music) Here's what I think; When we get the lover, we'll have the killer. (dramatic music) - [Joyce] I am really sorry about what happened the other night. - I understand. - Would you like to come in for a little while? - Yeah, only for a moment. These are for you. They'll help you sleep through the next few nights anyway. - Oh, that's very thoughtful of you. - Have you managed to get any sleep? - Oh, not really. No. I just can't stop picturing what Fiona must have gone through. - [Vicky] I'll bring it back tomorrow. - No, no, no, take your time. It'll probably be a while before we wanna watch it. - [Vicky] Thank you, Mr. Winters. (dramatic music) - Smile. - For God's sake Fiona, turn that off. - Sorry, I'll erase it. - [Len] Arthur, time to save for a drink? - No thanks, I just wanted to drop something off. Maybe later? - [Len] Sure, later. - Well, I better be going. - [Joyce] Thanks for coming. - Okay. Vicky, do you want me to drop you off? - [Vicky] Oh yeah, I'm just going downtown to see my dad. - Perfect, I'm going to the office. (dramatic music) - It's just unfair, you know? Fiona was so happy and excited these past few days. I think it had something to do with some new guy, but Fiona wouldn't talk about it, which was really unusual for her. But I told my dad and he thinks it might be significant. (dramatic music) - That video tape, is that the same tape that you and Fiona were shooting the day I stopped by? - Yeah. Fiona used it like a kind of video diary. I just wanna have a copy of it for myself. (dramatic music) - Would you do me a little favor? Would you go into Townsend's and pick up some good magazines for Mary? I mean, I'd go in there myself, but he'll probably talk my ear off for half an hour. (Vicky chuckles) - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. (train honking) (train rumbling) - [Vicky] Here's my dad waiting for me. Well, thanks for the Dr. Bradley. - You're welcome. - Okay, goodnight. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (TV static) (tape recorder whirling) (dramatic music) (Arthur breathing heavily) Oh God. Oh God. (dramatic music) Hey Fiona. Girl, smile for the camera. Oh, come on. There you go, you're a superstar. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Howard? - Oh, hi Arthur. Come in. - I noticed your light was on. I thought I better stop by. - Yeah, this is Fiona Winter's tape. You're on it. - A bit private, don't you think Howard? - Yeah well, I wanna see if that man that Fiona was on about is on here. (TV static) Looks like some of it was wiped. There you go again. So, what's up? - I wanted to talk to you about your problem. Lab tests came back. - Yeah, all right. Come here, sit down. Watch this with me. Looks like Fiona had a bit of a crush on you. (girls giggling) - Howard you have an ear infection? It requires a little more imagination than I've got, no thanks. Look, I wanna get you started on antibiotics as soon as I can. In the meantime, I wouldn't mind having another look at that ear. Howard, you can watch that later. - I realize that there's an age difference. Not to mention that he's already married. But he's just so interesting to talk to. (pensive music) He listens to me as if I have a brain. He makes me feel something that I've never felt before. Like maybe it's possible for a man and a woman to relate. He's also really cute. He told me the most amazing thing the other night. That he's only ever been with one woman in his life. He's not like the other guys are. (pensive music) (pensive music) (Arthur sniffles) (TV static) (Howard sighs) - What's this? (suspenseful music) - [Fiona] Smile. - For God's sake Fiona, turn that off. (suspenseful music) - Howard. (suspenseful music) - You. - Howard, it... (clears throat) It's not, um... - You were Fiona's lover? - It's not what it looks like. - What happened? Did she threaten to tell Len and Joyce? - No. - What did you do? Did you kill her to protect your reputation? (suspenseful music) - God no, I didn't. I didn't kill her, Howard. - I want you out of here. - Howard, listen to me. - Get out of my office. - Howard, Howard- - Get out! - Howard, listen to me. Listen! Listen to me! Howard, I was no where near her! (dramatic music) For God's sake, listen to me! (dramatic music) (door slams shut) (Howard falls) (Howard cries) - [Howard] Help me! (dramatic music) (Howard choking) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (tape whirling) (suspenseful music) (footsteps approaching) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Dad? Oh God. Oh God, dad. Dad? Daddy? Somebody help me! (suspenseful music) Somebody help! Oh God, please. Please no. Oh god! Somebody help me! Please! Oh God please! (dramatic music) Help me! - [Colleen] Vicky, what is it? What's the matter? - [Vicky] I need a doctor! My dad, he's not moving. Dr. Bradley's car is still across the street. He's gotta be in his office. Go, go! (dramatic music) - [Colleen] Dr. Bradley? (knocking on door) (dramatic music) Dr. Bradley, are you there? Can you come please! (dramatic music) - [Vicky] He must be there! He must be there! Daddy? (knocking on door) It's okay daddy, wake up. Daddy please! - [Colleen] Dr Bradley, we have an emergency outside. It's Mr Poolin. Dr. Bradley! - [Vicky] He must be there! - [Police] Somebody get him on the phone. (knocking on door) Dr. Bradley, can you come please? - [Vicky] Dr. Bradley! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Vicky crying) - He's dead, isn't he? Can you tell how he died? (siren wailing) - Sorry? What was the cause of death? (siren wailing) - Uh... - You were friends? - Yeah. Yes we were. Yeah. (birds chirping) - Boo. - Oh God. - Colleen told me you were very upset over Howard's dad. I understand. You must have been in your office when it happened. - Yep. - Did you see anyone or hear anything? - No. - [Larson] No? - I was busy catching up on paperwork. - So you don't have an assistant. - No, now that Mary's had the baby I'm gonna have to look for someone full time. - [Waiter] Your coffee, sir. - Thank you. Could you tell me anything about Howard's medical history that might have caused him to lose balance? - Well, you know, he wasn't in great shape. I was treating him for high blood pressure. He had a very bad ear infection. - I'm thinking somebody might have pushed him. (dramatic music) - Why would you think that? - His daughter told me she delivered a video to him. Something that Fiona Winters had shot. - Yeah, that's right. I dropped Vicky off at his office as a matter of fact. - So she told me. Howard was also onto an idea that perhaps Fiona's new boyfriend and her killer might be the same person. - Oh. He also could be fishing for a story. - True, Howard was like that. But the VCR and the TV were still on when we went up there. - Uh-uh. - No sign of the cassette, no sign whatsoever. Whoever took it, wiped the TV and the camera clean of prints. So I'm thinking the one who took it and wanted it pretty bad maybe bad enough to kill for it. What's bugging me is that I saw the camera at the Winter's house and did nothing about it. I ignored it. That's very frustrating. Now all I have to go on are some threads from a green wind breaker. (dramatic music) You don't own a green wind breaker, do you? - You've already asked me that. - Oh. Well, green is the color of hope. - Oh. (dramatic music) (Arthur coughs) He just left it. - Well, Arthur, if that's really what happened, there's no way that you're legally responsible for Howard's death. - Yeah, but what about morally Steve? - For that you need a priest, not a lawyer. But the tape, that's another matter. Are you sure you destroyed it? - Oh, I burned it. It's gone. - Sir? Excuse me, sir. The courts are convening, you're needed. - Well, tell the judge I'm in the can, will you? I'll be there in a minute. - Okay. (birds chirping) - That semen, Arthur, it ties you into Fiona's death, you know. - Oh God. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. - You were only with her the one time? - Just the one night. - And that's the truth? - Oh Christ Steve, you know me better than that. - Did you see anyone else with her when you were over at the house? - No, everybody asks me that. So what do I do if Larson asks me for a blood sample. - What else does he have? - How should I know? - Because you talk to him. I mean, does he suspect anyone else? I mean, other than my son. - Not that I know of. - So what are you thinking? You're going to Larson, tell him the truth, why? - Well, I don't know. I mean, if I admit to the tape and the accident with Howard and then they match my DNA with the stains, well that's it, right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry to say it is. Now look, I've gotta go. As your attorney, Arthur, I'm telling you not saying anything to anyone, all right? At least for the time being. We'll talk tonight? - Yeah, yeah. Thank you. - Yeah. (tape whirling) - [Larson] Arthur, Chief Larson here. Give me a call when you can. A couple of questions I need to ask you. I'm at the office. - [Mary] Are you sorry we had this baby? - What? - You've been withdrawing by the hour. There has to be a reason. - It has nothing to do with the baby, Mary. It has to do with other stuff, Howard and Fiona. - I thought doctors were supposed to be better at coping with people's deaths. You know, I think it's something else, Arthur. Are you seeing someone? - Why would you think that? - Lots of men have affairs while their wives are pregnant. The truth might help, Arthur. - There's no one else. (suspenseful music) - Was there someone else? - Nope. Nope. (pensive music) (Arthur groans) (pensive music) - [Steve] Arthur? (knocking on door) - Oh God, come on. - [Steve] Arthur? (knocking on door) (pensive music) - I've decided to tell Larson the truth. - For the sake of your conscience? - So that I can live with myself. - You know, Arthur, the problem with taking the high moral ground is that it's not always practical. - Yeah, maybe not. But have you any idea what it's like to live in fear? - Having a clear conscience, you know, is precious little company in a prison cell. - I know. Will you still represent me? - Yeah. Yeah, of course I will. (pensive music) (golf sticks clatter) - What? - There's a run in your jacket. - Oh, it's probably made in Taiwan. - Larson told me they found a green thread under Fiona's finger nail. - Is that so? - Yeah, the kind used in windbreakers. (suspenseful music) - Well, I guess I better get rid of it. - Steve? - You know it would never have happened if I hadn't seen you with her. (dramatic music) I would never, ever have tried. You know, I watched you both through the back window of the house. She was just... She was so incredibly enthusiastic. - My God, my God. - Arthur, just because you are prepared to be destroyed by a mistake, doesn't mean that I am. - A mistake, is that what you call strangling Fiona. A mistake? - You think it's not on my conscience? It's with me every waking minute. But nothing's going to bring her back Arthur, and the same goes for Howard Poolin too, you know. So why don't we just leave well alone, nobody needs to know what you and I have done. (pensive music) - I can't do that. And I guess there's a difference between you and me. - Arthur, if you try and pin Fiona's murder on me, I'll just have to tell Larson that you confessed. That you confessed to me that you did it. Who do you think they'll believe when they match the DNA? Don't make me do it Arthur, please. How say we just let sleeping dogs lie? Oh, come on. We've known each other for a long time, we've been good friends. Tell me we've got a deal. Come on, come on. Please. (pensive music) Arthur you've gotta understand. Listen to me, Arthur, please. Please hear me out. You know, when Corey first started going with Fiona, I just couldn't take my eyes off her. You know, she had this vitality that I hadn't felt in my life since my wife left. And then when I knew you had been with her, I figured I stood a chance. That night I went to the house on some pathetic pretext to pick up some papers that had been left behind. And she was just friendly, fabulously friendly. She invited me in, she offered me a drink. And then she kind of opened the door, asking me what I thought about older men, younger women involvement. I knew she was thinking about you, but I tried to turn it to my advantage. (dramatic music) So I encouraged them, I said that older guys can satisfy a woman in a way that young kids like Corey never could. And she laughed. How she laughed. She said that she sure agreed with that. And that's when I made my move. But as soon as I did she tightened up, you know? And she just chose the wrong moment to say no. I lost it, Arthur. I completely lost it. And the more she resisted, the more I panicked and the worse it got. (dramatic music) I mean, I remember putting my hand over her mouth to stop her from screaming out. But I don't remember really putting my hand around her neck. (dramatic music) I really don't remember. You have to believe me, Arthur. You have to believe me. - Arthur, we have to do a deal. I mean, anything else is a waste. We have to live. After all, there is Mary and the baby. Yeah. Remember, there's more evidence connecting you with Fiona's death than me. Those are your semen stains, not mine. And all I have to do is destroy the coat. (dramatic music) Arthur? Arthur! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Pull over, Arthur! Time to settle this now. (dramatic music) It's a deal, huh? Pull over, Arthur! (dramatic music) You stupid bastard! (tires screeching) (cars crashing) (monitor beeping) (oxygen concentrator hissing) (dramatic music) Arthur! (dramatic music) (monitor beeping) - Mary. This isn't the best time, I know. But in the days before Fiona died, did you see anyone visit her? - No. - So you have no idea who the new boyfriend was? (monitor beeping) - [Larson] None? - No, none. (monitor beeping) - Arthur doesn't either. We talked about it. - Hmm. (monitor beeping) (dramatic music) (police radio chatter) Get it over to forensics as fast as you can. (lab machines whirling) (printer whirling) (calm music) - [Mary] Arthur, your daughter really loves this toy. (baby cooing) (cat purring) (calm music) (calm music) - Good morning. - Good morning. - How are you feeling? - I'm okay. I'm good. - Good. (calm music) The case on Fiona Winters is officially closed. We had some loose ends but it's all over now. That semen stain we found wasn't Steve's or Corey's, and no one seems too interested in that now. (calm music) Arthur, don't stay here too long. (enchanting music) (enchanting music) (enchanting music) (enchanting music) (birds chirping) (calm music) (calm music) (calm music) (calm music) (calm music) (calm music) (fireworks blasting)
