- Damon, we don't have time for this nonsense, we are late. I have to do my homework, though. - Look at your sister. She's all ready. - I have seen Dad play a million times. - Jaqueline, say goodbye to your brother. He doesn't want to see his father play. - All right, fine, fine. - There once was a King of Siam... whose balls were as big as I am. Oh, jeez! Whenever it rained... - Mom! ...the balls always banged... - Why'd you teach her that? And made a big sound in the rain. - She's only eight. - Splish, splash. The balls always crashed. And one day when it rained, they almost got mashed. - Okay, shhh! Stop it. Stop it. So now when it rains, the king still remains, But seated and quiet at last. And you two move together, and you follow, and wheee! You fly in, and try to take over this note's place. And you battle and battle! Ya! Ya! Seven notes, seven days in a week. Oooh, I am... tired. - Hey guess what? - What? - I know something about your sister you don't. - What are you talkin' about? - You know, sometimes when I need a smoke, you know, late at night, I open my window so my parents can't tell. - And? - And there's your sister, man, at midnight, looking up at the moon, and talking to your neighbor. I mean, your neighbor's in college, what could they be talkin' about? They're out there for hours. - You are demented man, you know that? You are so demented. - Hi Peter. Dinner's ready. - Okay, buddy. Piggyback? - Yeah. - All right. - Bye bye, Peter. - Bye Peter. Come on in for dinner. That piano is off-limits. Your father sent you a little something. How neat. It's New York. He'll be home soon, right? - Yes, yes he will. Shall we say grace? Father, bless us these gifts that we are about to receive. - Feel! Damn it. - Dad? - Yeah, this is it. - Can I help you, Dad? - Jaqueline? You should knock first. Don't, don't you have work to be doing? - I just wanted to ask, Mom said you're going away again. Can't I go? It might be your last concert? How many do you need? One, two? - The early threat to the primary tonic, causes unrest. Hey Jackie, buddy, where's my little trainer? - Mister Muscles is calling. Go ahead. Less important than a football. - There she is. - Ready for this? - Yeah, I'm ready. - Three, two, one, now! Want to add some more? - More? Yeah. Let's do it. - Another. - Another? We'll do both at the same time. Here we go, all right. Hit it. - Yep. Come on faster. Faster! Faster, faster! - I'm going as fast as I can. Yeah, help me out with that. Oooh! You gotta be faster than that! All right. Here we go. - Will you ever turn off this ridiculous noise. This is so insulting. No shape, no progression. - Keep counting. What are you doing? Where, what is this? Mechanical static, garbage. Pumping and pumping. You don't have to insult me, you choose to do so. - Hey, put it back. - It doesn't even stop when you want it to stop. - Hey, hey that's mine. Hey, I paid a lot of money for that, you jerk! Give me that back. Give me that back. I paid my own money for that. Hey, take your hands off me. I dare you to touch me, you little punk. I dare you. Don't do it. Don't you do it. That was so expensive. Don't do it. - That's it, see? It's as gentle as that. We can create this. Try again. - Isn't it great? Some old record, left out on the street. That's what you find in the village. Valuable leftovers. Do you know this piece? - I am... familiar with it. - You have to play for me. Sometime. You've tolerated my playing plenty of times. - You play well. - No, no, I'm just looking for compliments. - You play with soul. That's the thing. I like your playing. - Anyway, you wouldn't have to be great to... - Could we actually change the music? Please? - Oh. Sure. - Something I've never heard. ¶ I grow gardenias for Rita. ¶ ¶ In my one room apartment downtown. ¶ ¶ In the window overlooking fifth street. ¶ - Violin really has always been my favorite instrument. - Shh, sh sh sh. - Stop. You must be in complete control before you start. Don't start before you're ready. The second note, the B flat, must draw us into the opening phrase. Hmm? Okay, let's move on. The slower part of this movement dee da da da. That has been somewhat too slow, so you want to take that up a notch, yes? Well, it'll get better, don't you worry. - Where is Mom? - Around here somewhere. Anyway, don't worry too much about the parts that need fixing. The Saturday competition gives us enough time. - Larry? Lawrence. Hi. It's such a pleasure to see you. I wanted to speak to you about an upcoming concert with... Oh, I'm sorry dear Jaqueline, hello. Your father didn't tell me that he had a daughter that was almost as genius as he is. So Larry, Lawrence, Mister Archer. - Stuart, Doctor Katz, we'll have to talk later. - Oh, yes. Of course. - As I was saying, the Saturday competition, I think we can at least use the second movement for the concerto category. Perhaps the Beethoven Spring Sonata for the Romantic. Hello Aaron, and how did you like my lovely daughter, hmm? - Went element successions move in parallel... they can move at different rates of ascent and descent. - Darling. Well, I just have to say that, that dress made you look so pretty. And I like those earrings. And from the stage, your makeup makes your skin look fine. Don't you think so? - Lovely, absolutely lovely. - Excuse me a moment. - Well, that's moving along in the right direction. Now you've been a bit, here, just two before nine, you've been a bit sharp here. Careful of that, yes? Yes? And let's really come down to piano here, so we can lean into that crescendo up to nine. Yes, try that? One, two. Let's try it again. Piano. One. One, two. Now that's not bad. Not bad, now if you practice hard before Saturday, don't let schoolwork, or anything else, take away your concentration, including those drama classes, that have you under their spell. We might, we might win. Excuse me a moment. One slip makes a difference. Work on it. And remember, no one can take my rightful place. One piont less, Jaqueline. - Jaqueline? Do you have an answer for me? - Yes sir, of course sir. Um... By the way sir, you look great today, the swoop of your hair. I believe the answer you're looking for is, 321.3 repeating sir. - Okay, who's next? You are so refined. You have such a soft voice. Why then, do you want to be like ordinary people who drink. - Hey Arch. - Hi. - But I like to drink. Speaking of, why don't you come to the Blackwood party Friday night after the game? - I don't think Friday night's really going to work for me. - Really gonna work for you? What's that supposed to mean? - My Dad and I. - Dad, huh? Well, I ain't gonna try and convince you. Blythewood party! No direct, genuine, free attitude to people and the nature left among them. None. None! - No, I beg you, please don't drink any more. - Why not? - You are so refined. You have such a soft voice. - Mister Thigland? Hi. - I see you're not in class. - Well, yeah I'm supposed to be in practice, right now. But I wanted to talk to you about the play we're doing, and the play we're bringing to competition. - Whoa. - And Governor's School for the Arts, and some of the plays you mentioned in class, I, I wanted to check out. - Slow down. What's the rush? Whoa. Sorry, I'm excited. - Take a deep breath. - Right. Chill. - His voice trembles and caresses one... I can still feel it vibrating in the air. - Would you mind giving us a moment? - You think I can do this, don't you? I mean, I'm okay aren't I? I know you're worried about time commitments and all, but I just, I just feel like, it's fun! - Let's talk for a second. Why don't you put that down? You're like a hit man with that thing. I have faith in you, but I do think you're spreading yourself a little too thin. - After tomorrow, I'm free and clear. I'll make it up to them, I promise. I know I can do this. - My chips are on you, kid. But I did have to consider someone as a backup. Hey, look at it this way, you're the only one with an understudy. - I'm going to do this play. The closing monologue is mine. - What is she doing in there? What does she think she's playing out there? Larry! - Don't-- - There's a competition coming up and she's noodling on the piano! So, let me know when you want to run through the program for tomorrow's competition. - Okay. - Ready? - So, I think we might want to use that for the romantic category. I should probably go back up to bed. - Archer, you came. Excellent. Hey guys, look who's here. Did she bring her violin too? - You made it. That's so great. - Holy... - Cut it. Oh. Whoa. Wait. Wait. - I'm gonna want to remember this tree. - Wait. No. No. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. No. Wait. No. Stop. Wait. No, no. - Sleep well? - Mm-hmm. - Shall we? - Yes, go through the program before we leave. - Got it. Now let me see. Wait. Wait. Hold on, just let me get this blackhead. - Mom, stop! - There's more coffee. - Done. - What was that about? - I'm so glad it's over. - Over? It's not over. This is just the beginning. - Don't say that. - Many of my best shows, I was about your age. - We shall live through a long, long chain of days, and weary evenings. We shall work for others, both now and in our old age and have no rest. - You cannot do this play. - Dad? - It'll split your focus. All it takes, is one point less to change your life. - It's unlikely I'll ever be at that level, Dad. - You have to concentrate. You never know. I have some plans. - There they are! The famous musicians of the house. Why don't you play us something? - I don't think so. - So, how did it go? - Okay. - Just okay, huh? Well, I had to try several places, since milk and cereal were not on sale, and that left me very little time to wash my hair, but I made it just in the nick of time, too. Is Jaqueline all right? I mean is anything wrong? She certainly acted saucy a minute ago. - Selfish, that's what she is. What do you expect? I told her about the wonderful opportunity I set up for her this week, with Doctor Portman, and she is just completely disregarding it. - Any reasons? - Well, yes but, come on, a school play. - That does mean people are depending on her honey. - I'm depending on her. - I know, and I depend on her too but-- - She's going to split her focus. - Well. - Who does she think she is? I have provided for her for 17 years and, this is what I get in return. - We. ¶ Where were you when I was bargaining? ¶ ¶ Where were you when I was bargaining? ¶ ¶ Where were you when I was bargaining? ¶ - Right on the dot. You are like clockwork. You know, I'll bet you're one of those people who is always just a little bit early. - Ben? What is this? - Let me think. Just a special dish I think you might like. You haven't eaten yet, have you? - It's... - So... nice. - Why don't you put your things down? Take your coat off, stay a while. What is this? - Just a valuable leftover. I found it on the street. I just need to clean it off. - I hope the music is okay. There's no violin. - It almost fits. - Wow. - Handsome guy. - Yeah, he is. Ben, this is just, thank you. - I wouldn't have taken you for the military type. - Hmm? That's my brother. - Oh. Let's eat. - Well? Come on, Ben. Where did you learn to cook like this? - It's nothing special really. Jedzcie pijcie i popus zczajcie pasa! - What the hell? - This is a magical Polish dish. If it works, I find out all of your secrets. Smacznego! Now I know you have an older brother, and I always thought you were an only child. - Mmm. - Mmm, hmm. Try it with this. Mmm! - We shall live through a long, long chain of days, and weary evenings. We shall patiently bear the trials which fate sends us. We shall hear the angels. We shall see all heaven lit with radiance. We shall see Earthly evil, all our sufferings, drowned in the mercy which will fill the whole world, and our life will be peaceful, gentle, and sweet as a caress. We shall rest. - What are you doin'? Your poor Dad's worried sick about you, and you're in here what, playin' with yourself? Wheee! - Cool. - I thought you'd like that. Okay, go put your clothes on, and get with it, will ya? Your Dad looked like he was gonna have a heart attack. - Right? Thanks. - You know, he's kinda cute when he's anxious. Sorry, sorry, sorry. - I don't know what I'm gonna do. I gotta-- - Look, you have one year left. - Yeah, then what? - Any word from your brother? - No. Look, I may need your help. - Are you gonna tell Pops? - No. It's just I thought, I might. - Go meet with him. We'll talk later, this sounds serious. Go, go. And, we'll improvise soon, whether you like it or not. Now go. - Where were you? I was looking for you. - Downstairs bathroom, we had no toilet paper up here. Feminine hygiene, you know. - If you were living at home I don't think we'd be having these problems. - Sorry. - It affects our performance when you're late for rehearsal. The slightest mis-- Let's get started. - Actually Dad, I need to cancel today. - Hmm? - I'm in some pain, I thought I'd go to the medical center, see if everything's all right. - We're behind schedule for the next performance. I'll go with you. - I can go alone. - If you're not feeling well, and it's serious enough to seek medical attention, I'm coming with you. - You should stay and work. I'm sure it's nothing. - Let's get going. - It's a private thing, I don't want you there. Damon, wish me luck. Okay, next? - Jaqueline, surprised to see you here. Good luck. - Okay. You may go now. Number 32, Jaqueline Archer. - Hello. - Whenever you're ready. - There is nothing for it. We must go on living. We shall live through a long, long chain of days and weary evenings. - Jaqueline? Allow your own feelings to surface. - I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here. - Might as well try. Yes? Keep going. Make it your thoughts, and not someone else's thoughts. - We shall patiently bear the trials which fate sends us. We shall work for others, both now and in our old age and have no rest. And when our time comes, we shall die without a murmur. And there, beyond the grave, we shall see a life that is beautiful, peaceful, and sweet as a caress. We shall rest, we shall rest. - Okay, let's stop. Jaqueline, I see you're not a theater major. Have you worked on this piece before? Okay. Well here are the rehearsal dates. I want you to take a look at this and make sure you don't have any conflicts. Be sure and take a look at that closing monologue. - I love the closing monologue. - Really? Okay, we're gonna be calling people in a couple of days. Thank you. - Great, great! Thank you. Thank you very much. - Good luck. - Shit. You okay? - I'm fine. - I'm so sorry. Let me just, could I? - Really. - Can I take you somewhere? - I'm fine. Are you from New York? - You can tell? - I love New York. - Have you ever lived there? - No, I've been there a lot as a kid. My Dad performed there a bunch. - My Mom lives upstate. I gotta drive back soon. Got a taste for the grit, huh? - The grit? - Don't worry about it. - Oh shit. - What? - What time is it? - Half past, I think. - Shit. Shit. I gotta go to the music school and get my violin. I'm, I'm late. I'm late! Oh, God! - Okay okay okay, just calm down and. - Rehearsal's at the performing arts center near the stadium. Do you know where that is? - Yep. Hop in. Egads. What would happen if you were late? Hold on. It sticks sometimes. Don't worry. Hey. Don't forget this. - Oh! Gonna be in a play, huh? - No, no. I won't get the part. Even if I um... I don't think I can. - Stage fright? It's not that. Even if I wanted to, I don't see how. It was neat to audition though. It would make a lot of people upset I think. - I don't follow. - I don't think my Dad would like it. - So? - It would make him very upset. - So? - My life is set. Wear black, and play the music of dead men. I gotta go. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Do you see what your colleagues are doing? - Um... We are waiting for you. - Right. - Do you see what I'm doing? - You're... not playing? - Okay, let's go. - Well, they can't keep this up all night. ¶ Lullaby ¶ ¶ And goodnight ¶ ¶ That would be ¶ ¶ The thing I like ¶ ¶ But every time... I stop and try ¶ ¶ to rest the dark creeps in on me ¶ ¶ Lullabye ¶ ¶ And goodnight ¶ ¶ Remember when you liked to sleep ¶ ¶ But my body hurts ¶ ¶ From all this work ¶ ¶ And now my dreams ¶ ¶ Aren't soft and sweet ¶ ¶ Will you play ¶ ¶ A pretty song ¶ ¶ One you made, we'll sing along ¶ ¶ Remember when ¶ ¶ You used to be a happy girl ¶ ¶ A wishing queen ¶ ¶ Lullabye ¶ ¶ Is interrupt ¶ ¶ by kill the clock ¶ ¶ and go to work ¶ ¶ What was I ¶ ¶ Before the world ¶ ¶ Tore the head off this dollish girl ¶ ¶ Lullabye ¶ ¶ Gets replaced ¶ ¶ With painful bones and shitty breaks ¶ ¶ But I still love the muse ¶ ¶ The hungry dream ¶ ¶ That begs for me oh that begs for me ¶ ¶ Lullaby ¶ ¶ Oh bye by¶ ¶ Oh bye by my lullabye ¶ ¶ See me stretch ¶ ¶ The meat of me ¶ ¶ My intellect... is wrecked and beat¶ ¶ Lullabye ¶ ¶ Lullabye ¶ ¶ Lullabye ¶ - You know if you stayed at home I wouldn't have to drive all the way in here just to rehearse with you. Your mother would be much happier. She really misses you. If you lived at home, she could be fixing your breakfast right now. So is everything okay? What did they say about the pain? If you lived at home we could take care of you, and you wouldn't be having these problems. - I can't. - What? Don't you dare go away from me. We are having a talk right now. Just tell me one good reason why you can't pay us rent, and live at home. You obviously can't take care of yourself. What is wrong with you? - Nothing's wrong with me, let me go to the bathroom. - No no no, no no, no more! No, you, you are not going to avoid me. You are going to behave like a normal, obedient daughter, as hard as that might be for you. Now, tell me, what did the doctor say yesterday? - He said I can't play music with you anymore, it causes too much stress. - You are so selfish. What do you hear? - Dad, Dad. - I just want to know you're okay. - Everything's all right, Dad. - You sure? - I didn't, everything's okay. I promise. - So that was a pretty good rehearsal after all, right? - Mm-hmm. - And what time are we tomorrow? - One o'clock. - Right. Oh, um, you want to get some lunch? - I'd like to but, I really can't. - Maybe tomorrow. - I'm not sure. - Okay. - Bye. - A boo ba do ba doo. A shoo ma noo ma noo. A shu be do bap bap bah! - No. - A bap bap bah. No! - You only have to play one, maybe two notes. I'll bet your Dad and Gould improvised. - Always with the Gould thing with you. I'm not gonna tell it again. - One point less. I mean... A life can change based on the split-second whim of a judge who's probably deaf anyway. One point less. - I should never have told you that, you nut. - My dear, you might not even be here, sitting with me, if your Dad had the extra point. Sorry, I'll zip it. But I would like you to try it with me. Music isn't made of stone. Unlike me, it's not always hard. - Okay already. - Oh, jeez! What the hell is this guy's problem? - I was going to tell you. - What? - He's from New York. Don't let his muscles, intimidate you. - What the hell? - Jesus. - Uhh, uhh, oh that feels so good, baby. But you know what sweetie really wants? Some fucking rest. Some fucking rest! Director called, Congratulations You got the part! I can do both. You can do it. It's no big deal. Just tell him. Tell him. - Associated but with a distinctive yet contrasting theme. So usually the two tonal areas... - Hello, I was coming to find you. I have a tremendous surprise for you. - Hi, I-- I do too... We are unbelievably lucky. - I-- I have a um-- - Well, you have to wait to hear this first. It'll be more work, sure, a lot more work, actually, but we can handle it. - Actually Dad I'm working pretty hard already and... - Yes yes yes, but wait until you hear this. Though you have a year left, Columbia Artists has decided to book the world tour with us. Our dreams come true. These are our contracts. We are going to tour together. I love you, isn't this amazing? This is only the beginning. - Dad. - Aren't you happy, hmm? - No. No. Let go. Let go. No, no. Let go, Dad. - Jaqueline? Jaqueline! - Yes, since this morning. You called before? - Yes, I called before. All right. Ma'am, let's just try and take a deep breath. - When he's upset, he leaves. He just drives and drives. Well, we are going to do everything we can. - Oh my, I've gotta go. - He's gonna be okay ma'am. We found him in a ditch. He had this. - She's not here? - No, dear. - I don't see where she is, but my daughter always loved this piece, and it is for her that I begin my program with Liszt's Funerailles. It's date of composition is the same of that of Chopin's death. There's suspicion that it is an homage to Chopin. May have affected Liszt to write one of his most majestic pieces for the piano. I hope you enjoy it as much as my daughter, and my family. Thank you. - Pick up, pick up. Hello? - Hello? I'm sorry to call you out of the blue. I'm sure your busy, I just. Jaqueline? - Yes, it's me. Are you okay? - I think I, I think I'd like to ride with you to New York. Oh. - Is the offer still good? I think the offer's still good. I was gonna leave in a couple of hours, though. Could you manage that? - Yeah. Absolutely. No. It can change. Wheee! Okay, how about this? So, some go everywhere together. They push and pull, yet they never touch. They can't. Or they lose their identity, the become one note, not two or more. I don't... You follow? - No. No. No, that's your thing. All right. You can drive. Dearest Matthew, you are such a great friend. I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye in person, but I cannot stay in this world. I got a chance to go to New York. I'll never forget you. I think it's time to... improvise. Love, Jaqueline. - Well, I'll be damned. - Just where I put my pain, that's all. - Gotcha. - You might need this. - Thanks. - How's that hand doing? - Much better. Thank you. - Piggyback? - Sure. - Hey, hey Mister Archer. Sorry, I can't chat now. - I think it's pretty lucky that you got the time to get away. - Yeah, thank you for letting me come with you on such short notice. - I enjoyed your company. You've got friends that know you're coming into the city, right? You didn't ask me when I'm driving back. You're not coming back with me, are you? - No. - It's just this collection of plays. You may already have them, but. - Thank you. - Oh! I'm sorry, I'm such a mess. Uh... I, um, Wow,I... I should have found another table. - No, it's fine really. - Oh, here. Have one of these. It's an amateur night. Well, it's a bar really but, sometimes, sometimes good people play there. - You play there? - No. No, not me but, maybe some day. - Okay. Thanks. - I'm sorry, do I know you? - No, I don't think so. - But you play violin? - Well. - Oh, I nearly forgot. My name is Ben. - Jaqueline. - Pleasure to meet you. - Nice to meet you. ¶ What you can do without ¶ ¶ And don't think you'll ever learn how ¶ ¶ You turn yourself inside out ¶ ¶ Turn everything else down ¶ ¶ For what you can do without ¶ ¶ Ghosts are in the walls and all ¶ ¶ The voices call across an empty room ¶ ¶ One is loud above the rest ¶ ¶ Telling you there's nothing you can do ¶ ¶ But carry on ¶ ¶ Carry on ¶ ¶ Don't give up ¶ ¶ For how long ¶ ¶ How long ¶ ¶ How long ¶ ¶ Angels have fallen on the doorways of New York ¶ - Ben? ¶ In the doorways of New York ¶ - Ben.

Well, you'd better find some room somewhere, because dessert is on its way. What are you gonna play? - I think I'm going to improvise. Well, I think that's all I can play right now. This is my father. Come. What do you think? We shall rest. We shall rest. We shall hear the angels. We shall see all heaven lit with radiance. We shall see all Earthly evil, all our sufferings, drowned in the mercy which will fill the whole world. And our life will be peaceful, gentle, and sweet as a caress. We shall rest. We shall rest.
