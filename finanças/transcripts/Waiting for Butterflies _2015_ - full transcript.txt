[Soft music] - [John] My grandmother was always clear about one thing, at the end of our days the truly meaningful parts of our lives have absolutely nothing to do with luck. Life is about being aware of the promises made to US by god. Understanding that god never promised a life without pain and heartache. He never promised that the storms wouldn't be many and that those many storms wouldn't be the harshest of harsh. The promises we do have is the strength to fight through the pain and the heartache. And an internal force to withstand even the worst storms. Once we have this clarity we know that the weather of our situations is not determined by simple luck. That the weather itself is not even a value. [Crickets chirping] It's our reaction to life's weather as we face it with the strong arm of god that will ultimately determine our destiny.

Real housekeepers don't complain. Rude. - [Rachel] Keep your things picked up. But I still love you. - [Ashley] Love you. - [Rachel] Don't miss the bus.

So it could be worse for ya. - Yeah, if it's at all possible to make things worse for me I'm sure we'll figure it out and make it happen! - [Noah] Good morning.

Of course you are. - Come on in, what's up? - I have a few folks you may want to see. - What happened? - Nothing really. - [Rachel] Nothing? - It seems Bobby denton had a few not so nice things to say about Lila and Nate thought he would ask him about it. - Bobby denton is a big fat jerk. - [Rachel] Lila! - Sorry. - No matter what Bobby denton says I think Nathaniel knows that he's not supposed to be fighting. - He asked him to say sorry. But he didn't. - Vicky, would you please take Lila back to class? - [Vicky] Sure thing. - Can I say one more thing? - Make it quick. - Bobby denton has two ice packs. [Laughing] - Let me get her back to class. - Have a seat. Are you okay? - I'm fine it doesn't even hurt. - Look, I know you were just-- - I know, I know I shouldn't have hit him. - As much as it seems like fighting can fix the situation I can promise you it doesn't. - There's never times where it's okay to fight for something? - What did he say to your sister? - He called her ugly, stupid and she looked like a fish. - [Rachel] What did Lila do? - Well, she told him he smelt like a fish. He needed to be punched in the face. - You're a good big brother to take up for your little sister but promise me next time you'll do everything you can not to hit someone. There are other ways to fight. - Okay. - [Rachel] Promise me. - I promise. - All right, get back to class. ♪ La la la la ♪ la la la la ♪ la la la la ♪ la la la la ♪ la la la la ♪ la la la la ♪ there ain't no life like candy land ♪ there was no fakes be your hands ♪ life is just a candy cane ♪ caught up dancing in the rain, rain ♪ rain ♪ there ain't no life like candy land ♪ there was no fakes in your hands ♪ life is just a candy cane ♪ caught up dancing in the rain, rain ♪ rain ♪ So come over right now ♪ so we can settle all the differences ♪ come see somehow ♪ you were just the one for me ♪ and go see your eyes ♪ when they're not so glued to mine - [John] I know that's not army man Antwan greer. - Oh-wah. - [John] What's up brother?

I didn't think you were due back until after Christmas. - Coming in on a bus this morning. Had the opportunity to come home early so I took it. - I'm glad you did. - Yeah me too. - [John] I bet your mom and sister were freaked out when you walked in through the door? - Yeah, I think my mom's still crying. - Yeah, I bet. - [Antwan] Had to ask the whole town how to find you. - Here I am. - Yeah. - A few birdies told me you've been spending your evenings out here working. Didn't believe them. I had to see it for myself. John Archer working. - Yeah I stay busy. I mean we can't all be soldiers. - Yeah, some of US are too busy making priceless works of art. - Yeah I wish. - Come on. We both know you're a genius. Stop being modest. - You know I do have an art show opening next week. Yeah it's my first one, I'm excited. - You should be. - Yeah it'll be good. - It looks like she ain't even been used since I've been gone. - Yeah. Well she's about the only thing of value I have in this world so gotta keep her that way you know. - You know the whole time on the bus this morning, I just kept thinking about what I was gonna do back on my first night in aiken. First night a free man. - Yeah? - Yeah. - [John] So what are we gonna do? - I don't know about you, but I'm gonna get me some dinner, get a little bit of shut eye. I'm tired, bro. - We ain't kids anymore, twan. Heck I get tired just shoveling dirt. Can't imagine what a day of war would do to me. - Yeah well you speak for yourself. I'm still a kid. Tomorrow I act like one. Go celebrate me back in town in style. - Okay. - So you with me? - Do I really have to answer that? - Okay then. - Okay. - So tomorrow. - Tomorrow. - [James] Is the little lady still coming over this evening? - [Carolyn] As far as I know. I thought maybe we could take her over to the pond and let her feed the ducks tomorrow. - [James] Oh she'd like that. - [Carolyn] If there were any ducks there to feed. Seems like they're less and less every time we come over here. - [James] Anytime it seems there's less of a good thing, we're probably just not looking hard enough. [Gasping] What's wrong? - [Carolyn] Nothing. - [James] Should we go back to the car? - [Carolyn] No, let's just sit down for a minute. - How bad is it? - It's already better. It leaves as quickly as it comes. [Sighing] I guess when it comes to aging, I'm not like fine wine. - Is there anything I can do? - No, no, I'm fine, really. - Well if you're fine, then I'm fine. - [Rachel] Are you brushing your teeth, young lady? - Yes. - You better be. Five more minutes. - At least your fictional time is less than the last one you gave them. - Funny. - Hey do you remember Sharon dirks? - Should I? - I think you met her at the food shelter function last summer. She's a redhead. - [Rachel] I think so, what about her? - It's her and her husband I keep having to show the place on diller to. - What? No, I know that look. That's the I have something to tell you look. Spill it. - I was just gonna tell you how amazing you look tonight. - I don't buy that but I'll take it. - I didn't hear you knock. - Under the mat. - Lila, your uncle John's here. Why aren't you at mom's? - [John] She ran out of chips. - Uncle John! - Hey, there she is. I swear you get bigger every time I see you. - [Lila] That's how it works, right? - I guess so. So em... What are you all dolled up for anyway? - She has a daddy date. - [Rachel] Something like that. - Well whatever the reason, you clean up well. - Is that a compliment? - Back handed. But a compliment nonetheless. - [Rachel] That's what I was thinking. - Are you ready? We still have to drop Lila off. - Can uncle John take me? - Can uncle John take you where? - [Lila] I'm staying with grandma. - I'm sure uncle John's too busy. - You know I do have more chips to eat. But I guess I could give her a lift. - I don't think-- - John that'd be great. We're running late already. - [John] Yeah it's no problem. - Have you had a single drop to drink? - I'm not answering that. - Straight from here to there? - That either. - John. - Okay, no alcohol, no stops. Got it. - Love you. - John thanks. - Yeah, no problem. - Please be careful. - Rachel, let's go. - Have fun you two. So where are your brother and sister? - Nate's at Harrison's and ash is anywhere away from this house. - She seems to spend a lot of time there huh? - [Lila] Yep. - I've got an idea. - Okay. - What do you say we stop for a cone on the way to grandma's. - I say yes. - Done. [Phone ringing] I gotta take this. Tell you what, grab that, order whatever you want and tell them to make two. - Okay. - Okay? [Phone ringing] - Ron, what's up, man? Yeah what are you thinking? [Gun firing] [Tense music] [Solemn music] - You know I can't remember the last time we took a walk for the soul enjoyment of each other's company. - We can maybe start doing it again if I can get you to get home before nine o'clock in the evening. [Laughing] - Fair enough. Of course you know after we start with the walks, then after that you're going to have to start taking me dancing every once in a while. - Dancing? - Yes dancing. You know I love to go dancing. What are you doing? - Dancing. - Here? - Right here. - There's no music. - Who cares? - You're right. Let's dance. [Gentle music] Thank you. - For what? - For nothing. For everything. [Phone ringing] - I thought we'd at least get through dinner. Answer it. - Not tonight. - Rachel, it's fine. - Let me see who it is. Hello? [Sirens wailing] [Chattering] - [Man] Yeah, they're trying to get her stable now and that's what we're doing. Trying to get her stable before they move her on out. Okay 'cause I have another test to do. - I was getting ready to close and then all of a sudden the door burst wide open and this guy walks in, and he comes at me with a gun and he demands all the money and then there's a kid. - [Officer] Take your time, it's alright. - [Shop keeper] There's a shot. [Chattering] [Solemn music] - [Rachel] Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Tell me she's okay. - Lila? - Okay. - [Man] They're working on her right way. - That's not my baby! Oh no! That's not her. [Chattering] Oh god, what did you do? What did you do to my baby? [Shouting] [Siren wailing] - [Vicky] Rach. - [Rachel] What am I gonna do? - What are they saying? - They told US nothing. - [Vicky] It's gonna be alright. [Solemn music] - [John] Nathaniel and ash, do they know? - Do you wanna tell them? - Where is she? - Inside. I wouldn't do that if I were you. - [John] I'm sorry. - I know you're sorry, John boy. You've always been sorry and you've always been a sorry selfish person. You spent your whole life worrying about John, worrying about all the little things you thought would make you happy. And everybody always just looked the other way. Let you do what you wanted to do. There were never any repercussions until now. Your selfishness has ripped my world to shreds. - I am sorry. - Stop saying that. The only thing you should be doing is getting on your knees and begging god to bring my baby back. - God, you honestly want me to pray to god? - That's exactly what I want you to do. - Forget it, okay, if god cared at all about me, if he cared about any of US, none of this would have happened. - [Rachel] Don't you dare say that. God didn't have anything to do with this. This wasn't his fault. It's your fault. No one else's. He didn't do this. You did! - Keep lying to yourself. - Let me make one thing perfectly clear. I never want to see you again. Do you understand? This will not be forgiven. I don't ever wanna see you again. - You don't mean that. - [Rachel] Oh I do. I couldn't mean it more. - I know she's not my daughter but I cannot imagine loving anyone more than I loved her. You have to know that. - The only thing that I know is that I hate you. - Not anymore than I hate myself. - You sent her in there by herself. Why? - I had a phone call. - My baby is dead because you had a phone call. Please. Never ever forget that. Get out. Get out! [Mellow music] - [Man] Would you get the next round? - Hey, could I get another? - You don't think you've had another, friend? - Pour the drink. - You got it. - Alright, this one's going in the corner. - Yeah right. Sean's tab, could I do a Jack and coke? - Sure. - Thanks. Thank you. - Where do you think you're going so fast? - [Woman] Excuse me? - You wanna come home with me tonight or what? - [Woman] Get off of me. - What do you think you're doing? Did you wanna die tonight? - [Man] You need to get out of here, kid. - And you need to listen to him. - Hey I'll go, I'll go, but I believe I ordered one last drink. - You know what, I'll get his last drink. - Thank you, nice guy. You think that hurts me? - No, but it's pretty funny though. - Oh yeah, that's real funny. - [Man] Hey just leave, kid, before you do get hurt. - Leave? I haven't even paid my tab yet. - Consider it on the house. - What, do I look like I need a hand out? - Come on, man. - Hey, how about we, move. How about we barter? Okay you give me liquor and... I'll help you clean the place up. - Hello. - Good morning, doc. - [Doctor] Carolyn, how are you doing? - [Carolyn] Well I've been better of course. - As much as I don't want to say this, I don't want to drag it out either. With everything inside of me I wanted to come in here and give you better news today. - Has it gotten worse or just not any better? - The chemo had no effect. Not only that, it's spreading much faster than we expected. - What exactly does that mean? - It means we do not have much hope for a positive turn at this point. - How long do I have? Please just tell US how long. - A few days, the very most a few weeks. - Um, can you go ask somebody for a glass of water? - Certainly. - Even with this, we can continue to administer the chemo. - Well you just said it's not gonna turn around. - Doctors are wrong all the time. But I will say, we're hoping for a miracle here. - No. No more chemo. What's gonna happen is gonna happen and I don't wanna be any sicker than I have to be. Besides god creates miracles, chemotherapy certainly does not. Thank you. - Okay. I'll give you two a few moments. - Tell me what I can do? If I could make it go away I would. - I need them here. Please James get my family here. I don't care what you have to tell them. I need them here with US. - I promise you, they will be here. [Phone ringing] - Hello? Hey papa. I'm good, how are you? It's papa. - [Rachel] I'm not here. - Actually she just walked in. Here she is. I love you, bye. - Thanks. - Hi daddy. Daddy I would but I'm super busy today. What? What's wrong? [Tapping on door] - Who is it? What time is it? [Knocking] - Open the door. - [John] Go ahead. - Well you don't look good. So you got a lot of painting done last night? - Why are you here? - Why am I here? I've been asking that myself more and more everyday. John what's your problem? - Being woken up this early is one of them. - What did you do last night? [Phone ringing] John. John your phone. Hello? Hi, sir, how are you? Yeah, one second. Hey, it's for you. - [John] Tell them I'll call them back. - It's your grandfather. - [John] Tell my grandfather I'll call him back. - You tell him. - Hey grandpa. [Solemn music] What? Okay, how is she? Yeah. Of course, course, I can come. Alright. Okay I love you. - [Price] Hey, is everything okay? - I don't know. - What's wrong? - My grandma, she's sick. - [Price] What kind of sick? - Like cancer sick. - I'm sorry. - It's fine. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. Toss some stuff in a bag. Go to aiken. - How are you gonna get there? - I'll figure it out. - Do you want me to come with you? - No. - Why not? - 'Cause it doesn't make sense for both of US to go. She's my grandma. - Okay. - You should, you should take off. I'm gonna hit the road. - Alright. I love you. - Yeah. [Somber music] - Have you heard anything about your appeal? - Not yet. I'm supposed to see the lawyer today but I don't expect much in the way of good news. How are you, young lady? - Okay. - Tell your father what you made on your report card. - I know how smart you are so I can probably guess. - Tell him, Laney. - All as, one b. - Wow. - It would've been all as but Mr. Pascer lost one of my papers. - That's still really good. - She works really hard. We should probably get going. - Okay when can I expect to see you two again? - We'll be back, okay? Tell your father good bye, Laney. - Laney, will you touch my hand? Daddy loves you, never forget that. - Let's go, baby. - Love you. [Solemn music] - Now don't waste those tears on me, I'm okay. - I don't understand, you're fine. We were over here just last week and you seemed fine. - I don't spend my time asking those questions. And my advice to you is you don't ask them either. The more questions you ask the better chance you have of getting answers you don't like. - What can I do? What do you need? - Same thing we all need, prayers. - Oh mom. I can't sit here and see you like this and close my eyes and ask for a miracle. I'm not gonna sit here waiting for that. - Honey you're forgetting something you once knew. We don't wait for miracles to happen the miracle's waiting for US. - How can you be so strong? I can't be that strong after every thing that's happened. Especially not after this. - Being strong takes the same effort as being weak. It's just the road you decide to take. - You say these things, and I really wanna believe them I really do. But at the end of the day, mama, you're still gonna be laying here dying. - Well that's the road you're choosing to take. Luckily it's not a dead end. I'll handle your prayers for you. Baby I know you're hurtin'. After all you've been through. Nobody would blame you if you never recovered. - What am I supposed to do? - Build around pain. Build happiness around all of your heartaches. When you do that, you'll see the dawn. - [Rachel] Oh mom [weeps]. - It's okay.

You grew up. - Not a little girl anymore. - I guess not, how's your brother? - [Sissy] Boy you really did get out of here, huh? - [John] I don't understand. - John, Antwan died last fall. He was killed in Iraq. I can't believe you didn't know. - No. No that can't be true. Someone would've told me that. - He's dead. I guess when you left aiken, aiken left you, huh? - Sissy, I'm sorry, I didn't know. - [Sissy] Don't apologize, he's an angel now. He's doing fine. - Yeah. Yeah well if angels exist. I've no doubt Antwan has his wings. Look I should really get going. Tell your mother I said hello. - [Sissy] I will. - It's good to see you. - [Sissy] It's good to see you too John. - This isn't about US, okay? Can we do this? - We can do it if we don't speak. That's something we should be used to. - Are you gonna at least let me know what I'm about to walk into? - What's in there is what brought you here. Answer your own question. - [John] I'm back. Good to see you grandpa. How are you doing? - Okay, okay. - Yeah, how is she? - Depends upon who you ask. - I'm asking you. - It's in god's hands. - [John] Is that your way of not answering me? - Is that your way of not hearing me? - Can I ask you something? - What's that? - How come nobody told me about Antwan? - What difference would it have made? - He was my best friend. - Would you have come to his services? Your grandmother wanted to tell you. I told her not to. Figure you had enough on your plate as it is. - Well it still would've been nice to know. Could've saved me some embarrassment today. - Sorry. We should've told you. - So what's the plan? - The plan John boy is for US to keep doing what we've been doing for what two years now? Being here for mama. - I can't change the fact that I haven't been here. Alright but let's figure something out because I'm here now. - John? - Yeah? - [Carolyn] Is that you? - Yeah, grandma, it's me. - God knows I've watched that woman upstairs cry herself to sleep, praying for you two to fix this. I've watched it too many times. I'm not gonna do it now. - I don't know what you want from me daddy. - It's not a matter of knowing, it's a matter of doing. - So now it's my fault. - Fault and taking responsibility don't always go hand in hand. You can have one without the other. - Tell me what I can do. - Well, I've been waiting a long time to hear you ask me that [laughs]. - What's this? - What it is isn't important but what it will be, will truly amaze you. - Okay. Okay are you... At least gonna tell me what I need to do with it? - When it feels right, open it. Page one will start you on a journey. - I'm not so sure I'm ready for a journey right now. - Do it for me. Promise, promise you'll do it for me. - Okay, promise. - You have something so special inside of you John. But it's up to you to let it out. When you do, oh my. God's artwork will be on full display. - Why do I feel like you're telling me good bye? - No good byes. Just an introduction to the potential that I know god has given you. - I've missed you. - Daddy I can't just sit around here and see her like this. I can't sit around here and pretend like everything's okay. What? - What do you want me to say? Clearly everything I've said so far hasn't helped, so... I'm here to do whatever I need to do. - Get some rest, you're tried. We're all tired. Rest could go a long way. - No, I'm fine. If you don't need me here for awhile, I'm gonna take a walk, clear my head. ♪ 'Cause you know my heart's desire ♪ so help me be a man ♪ what is your plan for me ♪ to open my eyes and see ♪ you are worthy ♪ you are worthy ♪ you are worthy of all praise ♪ 'cause you fill the void over the ocean [chattering] - Hey, hey! Is that aiken's own Picasso? Oh man. Man, it's like seeing a ghost. Heck the whole town thought you'd done curled up and died. - Nope, I'm alive. - Man now folks if you y'all don't know here, well John boy is one of aiken's few claims to fame. [Whispering] Now hang on, hang on this will just take a second. What was I saying? Oh yeah aiken's fame to claim. Listen if you guys need a picture or a painting or anything, he's your man. On the other hand, if you wanna keep your kid alive. John Archer may not be the way to go. - Just stop it. [Chattering] - It's fine, I know the sound of alcohol when I hear it. - I'm sorry, everyone calm down, calm down, we're just playing, having fun, right John boy? - Yeah, whatever you wanna call it. - Hey wait, wait, wait. Before you go, let's just say I wanted to have someone offed. Do I have to call you or set up some kind of appointment? How's that work? What? What, you all booked up? - [Man] Hey, hey, hey. - Do not pretend like you know me, okay? - [Jake] Get off me, John. - Laugh all you want, Jake. I don't feel a thing. I don't doubt you're up there. I doubt your motives. I need to know why you are doing this to me. I was always told that you wouldn't give US anything more than we can handle and yet here I am. I'm clearly broken and yet you insist on giving me more pain so either break me, I don't care, break me or let me be because I hate where I am. I'm sick of this. - [Carolyn] And through him to reconcile upon himself all things whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross, you who once were alienated and hostile in mind doing evil deeds, he is now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death. In order to present you holy and blameless in the above reproach before him. It's not the paths in life that make US who we are, it's the obstacles we forged through along those paths. Although this journey is specific, it's a journey that can be taken by anyone. Obstacle one. [Gentle music] [Ominous music] [Door buzzing] - [Noah] If I'm honest, i'm shocked to see you, John. - They didn't tell you who was here? - Common courtesy is sparse inside these walls. I'm not sure i'd believe them anyhow seeing our history and all. - Look I'm just gonna cut to the chase, my grandmother's dying. Doctor said it's day to day. Now can you tell me, whether that be of any importance to you. - But that can't be true. I saw her no more than a few days ago. She acted like she was fine. - That might be the case but apparently she hasn't been fine in awhile now. She was diagnosed with stage three stomach cancer over a year ago. What, you find that funny? - No, no, it's not funny, not in the least. It just figures. Mrs. Archer thought so much of other people, she wouldn't even let on she had cancer for fear of putting the slightest bit of attention on herself. Was there something I can help you with, John? - I'm not here for myself. I am certainly not here for you. She asked me to come see you. I felt like I owed it to her to do so. Here I am. Now I would like to know what you have to do with my grandmother. - I'd apologize again if I thought it meant anything. - It wouldn't, answer the question. - May I be allowed to explain the unexplainable. - She has me here for some reason. Explain it so it makes sense to me, and try doing it without being so casual. - Well let me start by saying my casual spirit as you call it is not meant to be disrespectful, not in the slightest. Brother, spirit's all we have in this place. - Oh forgive me if I don't have sympathy for you. - I don't expect it. I expect sympathy from no one. I know what I've done. I know what I'm guilty of. But I ask you to understand that I am not the same man you were staring at two years ago. - Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't that what everybody says in this place? - [Noah] Of course they do and most of them sincerely mean it. - Just tell me what you have to do with my grandmother. [Sighing] - My guess. She changed my life. Maybe she wants me to change yours too. - What could you possibly do for me? You're the one stuck inside these walls. - Please don't assume these walls take my freedom and don't assume being outside of them keeps yours. Besides who better to learn from than the man who's been to hell and back. - [John] Tell me what I'm here to know. [Buzzing] - Time's up, John. You know where to find me. [Solemn music] - [Carolyn] And are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom god put forward as a propitiation by his blood to be received by faith. This was to show god's righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present times so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus obstacle two. [Crickets chirping] - [Man] How was the pool? - It was fun. - [Rachel] Daddy, you gotta eat. - Not that hungry for some reason. - What have you eaten today? - I reckon I haven't. - Nothing all day? Well you gotta eat something. - [Carolyn] James. - You're eating something when you get back. - [Robert] You need to sit down and eat something. - Hey. Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt. - Don't be silly, grab something to eat. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. - Alright. What's up. Hey, stranger. - Hey uncle John. - How are ya. Robert. - Welcome home. - Thank you. So where's grandpa? - Your mother's upstairs resting. Your father went to be with her. - [John] How's she been feeling? - Her spirits seem to be high. - That's good. - Where have you been all day? - Trying to fulfill a promise. One that looks like I can't keep. - What? - She said she knew it was time. Closed her eyes and drifted away. [Solemn music] - Why didn't she ask for me? - She said her peace to everyone. Revisited a peaceful moment makes the peace at risk. She wanted to be remembered by nothing but a smile. - [John] Excuse me. - [Rachel] It's okay. - [Carolyn] If a man vows a vow to the lord or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all the proceeds out of his mouth and whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone so that your father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. Obstacle three. - Hey there. - Hey. How are things? - [Gabby] Good as always. - Hey baby. - Hey. [Knocking on door] - [Holly] Can I help you? - You may not remember me, but I'm John-- - Archer. - Right. - [Holly] How can I help you? - Do you have a minute to talk? - What do we have to talk about? - I'm not sure exactly. - Gabby, can you give me just a minute? - Of course. - Okay. What did you need to talk to me about? - Well I guess I should start by saying I met with your husband yesterday. - And why would you do that? - [John] I'm not sure of that either. It comes down to a promise I made to my grandmother, the rest I'm trying to figure out. - I really hate to ask this John, but... I'm a very busy girl, what exactly do you need? - [John] When was the last time you saw your husband? - Why? - I'm just trying to complete a puzzle here and I don't even think I have the right pieces. - I take my daughter in once a month to see him. We stay for a few minutes and then leave. Then I spend the next month trying to forget I sat in front of him. - Have you noticed a change in him? - Of course, look at what he did. When you're at rock bottom, there's only one way to go. - I don't know why, but for some reason, he had a relationship with my grandmother. A profound relationship it seems. - Noah's a lot of things but there's nothing profound about him. - I think that's where my grandmother saw things differently. It may even be why I'm here. - If that's the case then you're wasting your time. - Look I'm not trying to change your thinking. I can't even get mine to change. The next time you see him, be open to the fact that he's a changed man. - I can't even comprehend the pain that he's caused your family. My daughter, she's still sittin' in that house alive. If you're open to the fact that he's not a monster, then maybe I can try it too. Yeah. I need to get back inside. - This may sound really strange, but is there any way I can meet your daughter. - Yeah, sure. Laney. Someone here i'd like you to meet. This is John. - Hi Laney. It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, John Archer. - It was good to meet you too. - [Holly] Me too. - I should get going, but thanks again. - [Holly] You're welcome. - Price? What are you doing here? How'd you know where to find me? - There's this little diner like right when I got into aiken, gave me this address. Said I might find you here. - Well you should've called. Would've saved you the trouble of hunting me down. - It's no trouble, I kinda wanted to surprise ya. - Yeah, well you did. Thanks for coming. - How's your grandma doing? - She passed away last night. - John no, I'm so sorry. - [John] It's okay, it's okay. - You're a terrible liar, you know that right? - How would you like to meet my family? - I would really like that. - [John] Grandpa, i'd like you to meet price. - [James] Hello. - I just heard, I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - I know she was a great woman. It's good to finally meet you though, sir. I've heard lots of wonderful things. - [James] Sir. [Laughs] How old do you think I am? - [Price] I'm thinking late 20s. - Smart girl. [Laughs] - Price, this is Rachel. - It's nice to meet you. - You too. - Where are Robert and the kids? - He took the kids home. - Hey grandpa is it alright if price takes the guest bedroom? - Of course. - Thank you, I'm gonna stay out of y'all's hair, I just really wanted to come by and meet you guys and let you know my family's been praying for you all. - Thank you. - I'm gonna go grab my bag out of the car. - I can get it. - No it's fine, stay. I'll be right back. - Alright. - She's great, John. - Yeah, yeah, she is. - Daddy, do you need me to stay here tonight? - [James] I don't, I'll be just fine. - Yeah, you should go home, get some rest. I'll be here. - Okay. - Come on, I'll take you to your room. - [Price] It was good to meet you both. - [James] Nice meeting you. - [Price] This room's so roomy. - My grandmother loved her house. - I can tell. You know... You're kind of like a book I've had for awhile. Just never really opened it. I keep reading the front and back cover but I never look at the whole story. - What do you wanna know? - Everything. - Well you have to start somewhere. - Is Rachel your sister? - I have a long book. - What else do we have to do? - Okay. You know that my mom died when I was real little, I told you that. Grandfather and grandmother aren't really the only parents I've known. So aunt Rachel became my sister Rachel. We just never felt like siblings because of the age gap. We still had that same hatred that some siblings have just none of the closeness. That gap became a canyon after that night. - Your sister blames you. - Yeah. Yeah, she should. I would blame me. I've tried everything to get it out of my head. You look tired. - I am. - Chapter two soon? - [James] How did I know I would find you in here? - Probably because this is where I always come when I have words to say and no idea how to say them. What are you still doing up? - Probably the same reason you are. Nowadays it seems we get so focused on the minutia of the possible reactions to our words that we end up not saying the things that so badly need to be heard. - Yeah well based on my track record, whatever I have to say really needs to be heard. - So says the man saying them. Have you ever asked the folks hearing it? I hate to hear about people talking about failures. Failure is not easy. Failure takes effort. Where do we get off complaining about not getting the results we want or need when we didn't even try to get them in the first place? This family has had to endure a tragedy of a kind I wouldn't wish upon a worst enemy. But for the first time since it happened, it seems we're making strides to be a family once again. There's nothing in the world your grandmother wanted more than to have that happen. Don't let your fear of words prevent US from taking another step closer. You'll figure it out. I have something for you. Come with me. - She still is beautiful. No. No, grandpa, I don't deserve this. - Don't be silly, it's your car. - No, seriously grandpa. I can't take this. - Cars have more forgiveness than we do. - Thank you. - [James] Good night. - Grandpa? Look, I want to say the right things. I just don't think I can. - I think you can. More importantly god knows you can. You just gotta have faith. - I've heard that word a lot in the past few days. I don't think I have any faith right now. Honestly I'm not sure I ever did. - You may not have faith but one thing I can promise, faith has you, kid. [Door creaking] - What? - Can we please stop this? - [Rachel] Stop what? - Stop this. This thing that we do everyday. Rachel I don't know if I can take it anymore. I don't know what that means. I just can't do it. [Soft piano music] - Do you have some magical way to fix it? You think I like living a life like this? I'm trying. Everything I know how to take away the pain. As bad as it sounds, I feel better now that mama's died. At least now I can make myself believe that Lila's back with family. I am drowning in anger. My daughter thinks I hate her. My son hasn't spoken to me in days. And I don't... And I don't even wanna know what you feel about me. There's nothing about a life like this that I enjoy. - Rachel, when's the last time you got down on your knees and practiced what you preached? You've always told everyone else, to pray to god in their darkest hour. You are in a pitch black. You want to go at it all alone. - I guess I've grown up and realized that faith is easier to preach than to practice. - If you say faith was easy, it was easy it wouldn't be the key to so many amazing things. - I could have all the faith in the world and it wouldn't matter. No amount of faith is gonna bring Lila back. - You're right it wont. She's looking down at US from heaven and she'll be happy to know that faith brought her family back. I picture her smiling down on US every day. Rachel, magic doesn't make faith, faith makes magic. - I could use a little bit of both right now. - We've lost so much. I can't lose you too. [Easygoing music] - Sheriff Baxter. - John Archer? - Yes sir, this is my girlfriend price. - It's nice to meet you, price. This is my grandson, Matt. - Good to meet you both. - Hey Matt. Thank you for meeting with me. - It's no trouble. I'd do anything as a favor to your grandfather. What can I do for you? - I'm gonna let you guys talk. - Alright. Well, there's this prisoner that's in the county that I'm looking for some one on one time with. Noah-- - Noah wilcox. - Yeah, yeah, how'd you know? - That only makes sense. What do you need from me? - [John] How can I get some more time with him? - [Baxter] I don't know why you'd want more time. - Honestly sir I don't even know myself. I just know it's time my grandmother wanted me to spend. - I'll tell you what, give me a couple of hours and head on over, I'll get you set up. - Really? Just like that. - Just like that. - Thank you, sir, I appreciate it. - No problem, tell your grandfather I said hello. - I will, thank you, sir. - [Robert] Morning. - Morning. [Gentle music] - You guys make a habit out of watching US sleep? - At least not usually in the same room. - I forget they're not babies anymore. - Does this mean you guys love each other again? - Buddy we never stopped loving each other. - Could've fooled US. - We were only fooling ourselves. But that's a changin'. We haven't been a family for awhile now and it's been my fault and I'm gonna fix it. When you lose something so close to you, it often blocks the view of the great things you still have. But only if you let it. I'm done lettin' it. - I'm happy to have you back, mama. - Me too, baby. Me too. - Do you wanna come in with me? - No, I think this is something you need to do on your own. - Well at least take the car, go somewhere. - Okay. Maybe I'll spend time with your grandfather. - Bet he'd love that. Hey... Before we're apart again, I just wanted to tell you how I feel, I love you. Whatever has stopped me from saying that until now is absolutely nothing to do with you. It's just stuff that I've had to work out. - I love you too. Good luck in there. - Thanks. - You must know someone. - She's passed. My grandpa would have something to say here. The more we talk, the quieter it gets, something like that. - Sounds like a wise man. - [John] He is. - I'm gonna miss her. You know I don't even remember life before her, and I think that may have been her whole purpose. - You're a changed man, Noah. I didn't see it before but I see it now. - [Noah] I'm glad to here you say that. - Who were you? I mean... I think in order to find forgiveness I need to know why any of this had to happen in the first place. - There's nothing I could say to earn your forgiveness, John. - You have my forgiveness. I'm trying to forgive myself. - If you wanna hear the story, I'll tell you the story. - [John] Please. - Just tell me where to start. - Start before it all went down. - I was a supervisor at the furniture plant out in Richmond. I was wealthy by no means, but you know we got by okay and without much stress to do it. Then one morning I got up at 5 A.M. like I did everyday, drove my truck out to the plant like I did everyday and I scanned my card key like I did everyday. Only this morning, the door wouldn't open. Apparently from some time between that morning and when I left work the day before, the plant had closed. To this day, I was still not exactly sure why. That led to an immediate lifestyle downgrade. Cars, house, the food that we ate every night. The economy was in the dumps, I mean... Jobs were hard to find. I did every thing I could to earn a dollar but it was not enough. The closer I got to failure to making ends meet, the bigger the gap between Holly and I became. But at the end of it, she hated the sight of me. I don't blame her. It was my duty to provide for her and Laney and I was coming up short. I clearly remember the morning on the day it all happened. I was driving a wrecker truck then. Like most mornings, Holly wasn't really talking to me, so I kissed Laney and I went out the door. Towed a car back into town and soon after that my truck broke down. For that... I got fired. And that pushed me right over the edge. Something... Something snapped. Looked up and I saw it. Made a decision. For safety reasons, I always kept a gun in the glove compartment. I took it and I got out of the truck and then I stopped and I turned around and I emptied the clip, I put all the bullets on the seat. I was just desperate for money. Nothing more than that. Next thing I know i'm robbing the place. I know it was me standing there. It was almost like I was outside of my body and looking at it. And then she walked in. [Gun firing] I have seen that smile of hers every day since. I mean, aside from the fact there were no bullets in the gun, I don't even remember pulling the trigger. But apparently there was a bullet in the chamber and apparently I did pull the trigger. The rest is the rest. - Why didn't you say anything in court? You stood there and you said nothing. It wouldn't have gotten you off, but man it could've helped. - How could I do that to Lila? Huh? Whose fault was it? Hers? It was my fault regardless of the surrounding circumstances, it was me standing there, it was my gun, my bullet. I killed that little girl. I didn't deserve to say anything. - I think we use the words blame and regret too much. What we need is forgiveness, redemption. - Starting to sound like your grandfather now. - I just pray that god will give me the sense to take my own advice. - [Noah] You'll get it. - There is one more question I have. It's actually the only question I came in here with. - You wanna know how the relationship between me and Mrs. Archer began. Much like it did with you. Complete shock that she was sitting in front of me. - Mr. Wilcox. - Why are you here? - [Carolyn] I take it you know who I am. - I do, why are you here? Most people would say because I've lost my mind. But I'd like to think I see hope behind those eyes and with a little hope, faith can be turned into peace. - Why do you want me to have peace? - When we're faced with tragedies, there are obstacles that stand in the way of faith, redemption and forgiveness. And when these obstacles are removed, then we can find our pathway to peace. - [Noah] That's when she started to tell me about something called the butterfly diaries. From then on, she would come to visit me every week. Sometimes every day. She would read from the Bible to me. She would tell me stories of faith. Stories of redemption. Stories of forgiveness. I never read what she was writing in those diaries. But she kept it up over the years. - Faith... Redemption and forgiveness. - Yes, she was very clear it had to be in that order. Faith starts it all. - You were right all along. She changed your life and she wanted you to change mine. - She was very intentional. Mrs. Archer knew when it comes to some people, a certain voice needs to be heard. - Thank you. - Those are two words I never expected to hear again. I didn't expect it but I was always hopeful. - Can I get you to take a walk with me? - Sure. Let me grab my jacket. - Well you haven't yelled at me yet. I think we should celebrate that at least. You know I thought I tried everything I could to get you to forgive me. And-- - John. - [John] No, let me finish, please. - Okay. - Please. Umm... I went from seeking your forgiveness to being angry at you for not forgiving me yet here we are and... For the first time since that night, I can honestly say I forgive myself. [Gentle music] And the heartache that I've caused this family is unforgettable. But thanks to some good advice, I believe that unforgettable can be forgiven. Rachel I love you. But what I need most right now is for you to forgive me. - I don't think I've ever spoken words that had the potential to control my happiness as much as this. I've never spoken words this big, John boy. But I do love you. And I forgive you. Are you ready, daddy? - Reckon I'd better be. - [Noah] Where's Laney? - [Holly] Oh she's out there with Gabby. - [Noah] What's going on? - Nothing. I just wanted to have a second to talk to you before I brought her back here. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. John Archer came to the house. - He did, he must get around. - [Holly] And I know he's been here to see you. - He has. - Yeah. He told me I needed to come in here with an open mind. That you're a changed man. That you're not the same man that you were. - And? - It got me to thinking. Signs that you're a new man have been right in front of me. I've just been ignoring them. - Why? - 'Cause I couldn't handle forgiving you. Seeing you as a monster trapped behind this glass. In some odd way, it makes my day easier. Because if I have to think that you're still the man I married, how am I supposed to sit at home everyday without you? I hesitate to say I love you. Not because I don't, but because it would be so much easier if I didn't. - The hard truth is I may never get out of this place. I can't expect you to sit around the rest of your life out there waiting for me. I can't even expect you to want to love me. But to hear you say that you fight against the need to, that's music to my ears. - I love you. - I love you. Hi baby. - Hi daddy. - It's good to see you. - I was wondering if maybe we could do the hand thing that you and daddy did last time. - Sounds good to me, Laney? - [Price] Let me help you. - I got it, I don't need help. - Sure looks like you do from here. Okay enough, let me do it. Not every southern man your age knew how to tie a tie. - Hey, I know how to tie a tie. - Yeah, yeah, you do, do ya? - Yeah. - Well your suit looks good. - Thank you. - [Price] The last obstacle is just getting this thing around your neck. - Wait what? - What? - You just said my last obstacle. - [Price] Yeah, your tie and done. - Hey there's something I need to do. I'll be right back, okay? - What's going on? John we gotta go to the funeral soon. - Here. Take my keys head to the chapel and let everyone know I'll be there, okay? - [Price] You want me to drive you? - I've gone two years without a car, I'll be fine. See you soon, okay? [Gentle piano music] - Good morning. The family would like to thank everyone for their attendance. I can't stand here and claim to know what angels are like. But I do know this. And that is if they're anything less than Ms. Carolyn Archer, I gonna be very disappointed it seems as lately every time I was around Ms. Archer, she was singing a song. If she wasn't singing this song, she was giving me one lyric. She was helping me apply this lyric to the message that I was to deliver on sunday mornings. It seemed like at those times she was my pastor. Certainly not the other way around. So many times it felt like that. I used to tell Ms. Archer how much it hurt my soul to stand up here in front of good folks such as yourself and try to think of something to say that could quite possibly simply stop one tear from falling. I remember one time as I was explaining this to her, she looked up at me, spread her hands out, she said, "pastor!" We all knew what this means when she does that. She said, "pastor, "you can't have a funeral without the fun." Fun, she compared a funeral to a celebration. She looked at me and she said, "now you go out there, "and you tell those people "how lucky their loved ones are." Lucky. Lucky because now they're standing next to the hand of our maker. In the presence of our lord and savior and how glorious that it must be. So let's put a little fun into this funeral. Let US enjoy this song and let US celebrate. Let US celebrate Ms. Carolyn Archer.

If there was anything I could do to bring her back, I would, please believe that. Mr. Mills. - [Robert] What am I supposed to say? - I know what to say. Our mother would be glad that you are here. And I'm glad that you're here. - I'm sorry. - I know. I forgive you. And I know... I know that our baby forgives you too. [Emotional music] - You know Ms. Archer always said that she was waiting for butterflies. I never told her this but I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about but now I do. It warms my heart to know that she's no longer waiting. [Gentle piano music] ♪ Amazing grace ♪ how sweet ♪ the sound - [John] Carolyn Mabel Archer's favorite scripture was this. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind. That by testing you may discern what is the will of god, what is good and acceptable and perfect. Romans 12:2. It's been said that if nothing ever changed, there would be no butterflies. I pray that we all have lives full of butterflies, full of change that is met with our eyes and faith, forgiveness and redemption. With our eyes on the miracles. Not the miracles we are so sure we need or the miracles we are so sure we deserve, but the miracles that like to show themselves as we are. Waiting for butterflies.
