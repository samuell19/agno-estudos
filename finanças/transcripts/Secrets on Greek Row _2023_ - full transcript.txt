Shares at lancaster holdings dropped 62 percent today After a court awarded former lancaster employee vera quaid $10 million in a sexual harassment judgment Against ceo roger lancaster. Mr. Lancaster, I need you to open this door And vacate the premises immediately. Mr. Lancaster, you have five seconds to comply. Five, Four, Three, Two... One! ♪ t-h-e-t-a ♪ ♪ one heart, one way ♪ ♪ t-h-e-t-a ♪ ♪ we are thetas all the way ♪ ♪ t-h-e-t-a ♪ When I was younger, I used to wish every night for a sister. For now, I have more sisters than I ever thought possible. But tonight, myself and my fellow sisters Will form a special bond with the new pledges We've picked to be our official little sisters. On my signal, run upstairs And find the door with your name on it. Behind the door will be your big sister Who has picked you to be her little for life. Ready, set... Go, thetas! Guys, come on, let's go! I'm so happy you picked me! I adore you! Besides, you're the only girl in the house Who doesn't make fun of me when I play My mom's old van halen vinyls. Come on! Is that the reason you like me, because I know the difference Between david lee roth and sammy hagar? That, and you remind me of myself When I first joined theta. I can tell you're not really sure What this whole sisterhood thing means. They're trust bands. One for you... And one for me. That way, we know we'll always have each other's backs. Oh, hang on. Hey, wally. Yeah, I'm here with my new little. No, not jessica, it's winter. "fifteen years ago, vera quaid took down a business empire." Sorry about that. My boyfriend plays baseball, And he just got back, so... Is your mother vera quaid? The one and only. Do we look too self-righteous? It's just a preview issue, it comes out next week. Do you think she'd sign a copy for me? Your mom was the #metoo movement Before anyone even used hashtags. We read about her in my women's studies class last week. Yeah, I'm sure I could introduce you guys. She lives here in louisville. That is, if I can ever get her to actually come visit. Hello, did everyone forget about the ice cream social We're hosting for the new littles? That's right. Come on, winter. No ice cream. Shoot, I forgot to buy some. That's why we need a new house mom asap. The kitchen's been falling apart ever since liz left last month. Yeah, I know, the advisory board swore That they'd have a new house mom for us any day now. Let's just go out for ice cream instead. Okay, but not before winter opens this! This will help you deal with certain expectations We have for you now that kaylee is your big. Ha-ha. Good one. Come on, oh my god. Are you guys making fun of me? No, she's making fun of me. The cradle-robbing jokes are getting a little old. Are they? Look, we're all expecting you to follow in kaylee's footsteps And date someone younger too. Um, if I did that, it would be illegal. No, pay this evil, jealous, and sad woman no mind. Besides, wally isn't even that much younger than me. How old is he? He's only 18 years old? Mom, he's more than his age. He's on a baseball scholarship, And we're both pre-law. He understands me. His dad died when he was young too. Yeah, yeah, back up. I'm still not quite past the fact You're three years older. Dad was seven years older than you. I was 30 and he was 37 when we met. That is a big difference between a 21-year-old woman And an 18-year-old boy. Well, if the gender roles were flipped, It wouldn't be a big deal. Besides, you always wanted me to be more of a feminist. You should be thrilled. Not only am I president of the sorority, But now I'm also dating... Yeah, wait, stop. You're the president now? Yeah, I told you this months ago. Well, I thought you were president of the keg committee, Not the whole house. You know, when I was in college, I didn't have to pay friends To hang out with me. I should get back to the house. Let's just do lunch another day. Oh, no, no. Okay, okay, okay. Let's just... Start the day all over again. I didn't invite you to lunch so we could have an argument. We usually do that over breakfast. Look, will you at least come to my sorority house And see why it means so much to me? And my little sister winter really wants to meet you. She studies you in her feminist studies class. How ironic. When I blew the whistle on lancaster 15 years ago, Barely one other woman would stand in solidarity with me. Now, I'm a pop quiz question. When roger lancaster killed himself, People acted like I was the one that shot him. I still get crazy letters in the mail. You never told me that. Well, that's because you have other things to worry about, Like the lsats. How'd your exam go? Hey, go greek, let's go. Where are the chi boys? Don't you mean, where's wally? He's probably getting plastered with chase and the others. Uh, he better not be. I'm counting on him to help us win. He's supposed to... Supposed to what? Do this? - Hi! - Hey! - I missed you. - Missed you too. Can you two find like a romance novel to pose for Before I literally barf and ruin my new outfit? Oh, hey, don't worry. I'll hold your hair back while you're puking. Wally, where are your manners, buddy? Come on, get these ladies some waters. You got it, boss. - Really? - What? Oh, he's my pledge to boss around for the year. Oh, look, besides, come on, he loves it. Okay, well, for the record, I'll never make you fetch my water. Um, are you kids just gonna stand around here, Or are we gonna go out there and win this thing? Come on, now! Let's go, everybody say, "go greek!" Go greek! All right. Go, team. - We'll see you out there. - Go. Wow! Kaylee's boyfriend's a lot cuter in person Than I thought he'd be. And very much off-limits, So maybe turn your eyes to another prize. Let's go, come on, pull! Pull! Oh my god. Come on. Oh my god. Um, I have something for you. Happy anniversary. Well, six-month anniversary, anyway. We're lavaliering already? Is that what it's called? 'cause... I just wanted to let you know How special I think you are. I already do. No, wally! - What? - I'm all sweaty! Who cares? So am I. Well, you're right. Greek life sure isn't what I thought it was. Mom? What are you doing here? Well, you told me to come visit you at your sorority. The girl at the house said you'd be down here. Uh, well, I'd like for you to meet my boyfriend. Hi, I'm wally lancaster. Um... Nice to meet you. I'm vera quaid. You're vera quaid? My mom is that vera quaid. Uh... Kaylee, why did you never tell me who your mom was? I didn't think it mattered. Um, wait a minute. Wally, did you say your last name was lancaster? Well, you're not related to that roger lancaster, right? I mean, just because you have the same... He's my dad. Or he was, um... He killed himself when I was three. But... You both probably already know that. I'm sorry, kaylee, I have to go. - Wally... - I'm sorry. Wally, don't go. Hey, I'm still studying! Don't lock me in. Is anybody here? Who's there? Anyone?! Open the door! Kaylee? Why are you screaming? What's happening? Somebody locked me in the building. They were breaking stuff and... You know raleigh hall closes at 8:00, right? Sorry, I just... I haven't been acting like myself Since wally and I broke up... Or I think we broke up. He hasn't been answering my calls or texts. The guy sure is a real mess. I mean, it's starting to piss me off, actually. Wally hasn't... he's been a real downer lately. Has he said anything about me? No, he barely talks to anybody. And he still hasn't asked anybody To our toga formal on Saturday. You think winter would go out with him? You want him to ask out winter? I mean, they're both pledges. Sounds like a perfect match to me. And I'm not because I'm older? You're the president of your sorority. Wouldn't be appropriate for you to date a new pledge. And who is appropriate? You? Why not? Be my date to the formal. You know, you can't come unless a chi officially invites you. Fine, but only as friends. And it'll give me a chance to talk to wally. I'll do it with you, it's okay. You guys are embarrassing me. You actually showed up. Here you go, birthday boy. You better drink every drop. What is it? What's up with the bourbon? A million years ago, someone came up with the idea That the thetas have to give the chi president A bottle of bourbon on his 21st birthday. And vice versa, 'cause last year I had to give kaylee a bottle, and I... Wait... Are you re-gifting me? Get in here, you cheapskates. Hey, chase, I just finished setting up the dj equipment By the hot tub, but, um... Oh, uh... Hi, kaylee. Wally, why don't you get in the hot tub with winter And do something you'll both regret in the morning? Listen, chase, I don't know if I really wanna do that right now. You want what I want. Don't cop an attitude. You gotta do whatever I say until your sophomore year. - Okay? - Okay. Now go! Chase, can I talk to you? Alone? Wally, why don't you show both of us the hot tub? So... How alone with me do you want to get? Stop the douche boy act. Why are you trying to get in the way of me and wally? Actually, you're the one in wally's way. I want the kid to sow his oats. So, why don't you have a drink And get off my back? You know, you used to be fun. People are having a good time. What a great turnout. Yeah, I like it here. Yeah, your hair looks great. Oh, thanks. Is it a mess right now? Get something out. No, it looks great. Okay. I was working on it. Yeah, I get it, I'm the new guy. It's okay, I am too. Oh, thanks. Cleaning your hair. Act like you're not much of a dancer! What gives it away? Thanks. Actually, it was just an excuse to touch you. It didn't winter long to move in on him. I told you not to pick her to be your little sister. Yeah, I know, but... I don't know, I felt bad when I found out no one wanted to be her big. Besides, go easy on her. She's young. So is he. Maybe too young. Uh, well, I'm gonna head off. See you at home. Bye. Be right back, okay? Wait. Hey, listen, I don't want you to go, okay? Winter's cute. I don't blame you. You can give her this. No, listen. I'm sorry I didn't call you back. Okay, I just... I've been trying to figure all this out. It's okay. I understand. You don't want to be together anymore. No, that's not it at all, I... Well, then, what did you figure out? That I love you. Kaylee, all my life, my mom told me About how vera quaid destroyed our family's reputation, And I was too ashamed to talk about it. That's why I never told you what happened. Well, what happened between our parents Has nothing to do with us. My mom was furious When she found out I met you. And last night over the phone, she told me I had to decide who I wanted more in my life, You or her. I won't come between you and your mom. Because I chose you, kaylee. That is, if you still want me. Yeah. Oh, what's the rush? - I'm sorry. - It's okay. That's what I'm talkin' about! I knew you two would make up. Give me some. The guys are gathering downstairs For my birthday shots, you ready? Time to go, let's do this thing, man, come on. Oh, sorry, kaylee. Guys only. Wally's only 18. So, he's a minor. Birthday shots? Don't get crazy with him in there. You know what happened to the omegas When they were busted for underage drinking. Don't worry. I'll have your boy toy back before you know it. So, uh, how did things go with ryan 2.0? His name wasn't ryan. This party's dying. Everybody's going to pike's. Should we go? Uh... No, I'm gonna wait for wally. He's been inside with chase and the other guys for a while now. They're doing some sort of secret initiation thing. Initiation? Pledge week is over. Yeah, these guys look for any excuse To get naked with a goat Or whatever they do in the basement. Ew. Really? - You're crazy! - Oh, you did good, man. - I did? You swear? - I'm proud of you. It's the best party ever, bro! The best party ever! Where'd everybody go? - Hey. - Hey, handsome. I'm so happy we're back together. How much did you have to drink? Why, you want some? Here, catch. Oh... Man overboard! I told you to take care of him. I'm not his dad, so, Why are you acting like his mom? Uh, he's blitzed out of his mind. I'm fine. Come on, wally. Let's get up, come on. Okay. You know, the only person not having any fun around here Is you. So the only person that should leave is you. Chase, stop, stop, stop, stop. Come on, wally. I'm sick of you bossing him around! Hey! Chase, chase, let her go, stop! Wally! Don't touch the water! Wally! You'll get electrocuted too. Kaylee. The service starts soon. I never told him I loved him. He told me he loved me, but I never said it back. Why didn't I say it back? Wally knew how you felt about him. No, he didn't. And now he never will. This has to be a bad dream. Gosh darn, that's a nasty gate. Y'all need to get that mess fixed. I don't mind cookin' and cleanin' for y'all, But outdoor repairs are not my thing. Uh, this is the theta house, right? I'm carolyn, your new house mom. You are? But you're, like, so young. Well, thank you. You're just not what we were expecting. Our last house mom was 80. Well, honestly, you're not what I expected Sorority gals to look like either. Is the goth look back in? 'cause y'all look like you're dressed for a funeral. Yeah, we... We are. Oh my word, I'm so sorry, I... I just... I wanna drop dead right now from bad manners. And that sounds even worse. No, it's... it's okay. You didn't know. Welcome to the theta house. We're happy to have a new house mom. Well, this'll be fun! Mom? You came? You barely knew wally. You met him once. I know how much he meant to you, So he means a lot to me. So he means a lot to me. Why was I such a jerk to wally? I hope he knows I never meant it, 'cause he was like a real little brother to me. Why did I let him put the speakers so close to the water? It's not anybody's fault. Then whose fault is it? You're wally's mom? I hoped we would meet one day, Under better circumstances. But this is par for the course When it comes to your family and mine. First, your mother got rid of my husband, And now you got rid of my son. Don't take your anger out on my daughter. Why don't you stay out of... Vera? I didn't recognize you with the new hair. My sympathies go out for you and your family. My sympathies go out for you and your family. It's okay, everyone. I'm sure she'll sue me, Just like she sued my husband. In fact, why don't I... Why don't I save ms. Quaid the trouble And write her a check right now for all the pain and anguish My slap surely put her through. Sabrina, please don't do this. Oh, would you rather have cash? Take it, take it all! You might as well, because I have nothing left! What your husband did to me was settled years ago. - It's over! - If it was, Then your daughter wouldn't have targeted my son As soon as he enrolled on campus. I want you out of here! Mrs. Lancaster, please... This is a day for wally, And I refuse to have you lecherous women Be a part of it. Now leave. Get out! Come on, honey. It's okay. What story are you gonna tell? Chase! You scared me. Why are you gardening at night? I wanted to pick a bouquet of roses for wally's grave. Since I was kicked out of his service today, I thought I'd go back tomorrow. That's nice. But you still haven't answered my question. What story are you gonna tell? Story? About how wally died. You sound like you want me to make something up. Do you plan to? Chase, you're shaking. Are you okay? A detective came by asking questions about wally. Yeah, he's from some insurance company. Apparently his mom had a life insurance policy on him. What, his mom took out a life insurance policy On her 18-year-old son? That's weird. My mom doesn't have a policy on me. Did... You and wally ever do... Ghb? Ghb? No, of course not. That's like a date-rape drug. Why would you even think that? Because it was in wally's system the night he died. His mom told me today. I guess she ordered an autopsy on him or something. An autopsy? But it's so obvious how wally died. Hey! Who's there? Chase, wait, calm down. I was just taking out the garbage. I'm on trash detail. Then why were you eavesdropping? Chase, stop it. Sorry. You gave us a scare. Yeah, you gave me one too. Why are you acting like this? Because if that detective keeps coming by, Asking questions, Then everything I've ever worked for could blow up in my face. You didn't do anything wrong. But it looks like I did. My fraternity brother died, kaylee. Right in front of us. It was just a terrible accident. I keep telling myself that, But the more I do, the less I believe it. You make it sound like wally was killed on purpose. Was he? Everything okay? Yeah, um... I think I'm just gonna go take a shower. It's been a day. Good night. Kaylee! Don't forget these. Thanks. Okay, everybody. Out with it. Who wrote that sick message on the bathroom mirror Last night? What makes theta different from the other houses Is our honesty And how we all stand together. Unless... You're all standing together in the belief That what happened to wally is my fault. Kaylee, of course not! Fine. Then, one by one, I want you to tell me If you wrote the message Or know who did. Jessica? Sam? Winter? I'd never do something like that. I know it wasn't lori. Why couldn't it be lori? Uh, because I'm her best friend. And I'm her little, But that didn't stop her from accusing me. Maybe because you haven't stopped glaring at her. I'm sorry I'm not doing jumping jacks. Wally was my friend too. You knew him for literally, like, less than two minutes. And I could have gotten to know him much better, But now I never will. We all know you wanted to be more than just friends with him. Okay, fine. Winter, you're right. I shouldn't assume anyone here is innocent. Lori, did you write it? And it really hurts that you would even think that I could. Kaylee, why are you only asking us and not the other sisters? 'cause we were the only ones in the house when it happened. That doesn't mean someone else couldn't get in. It's not like we have a guard dog at the door. hang on, lemme get this. No, I think we're done here. It's pretty obvious where your loyalties lie, And they're not with us. Lori, wait, don't be mad. I had to ask everyone, to be fair. Hey, chase, it's really not a good time. We're packing up wally's stuff. I thought maybe you'd like to come And take a memento of wally's Before his mom comes and takes it all away. Man, I didn't think it was gonna be this hard. It's like wally's dying in front of me All over again. I'll be right there. Thanks, kaylee. I don't know if I can get through any of this. Each day's harder than the next. It's just nice to know I can reach out to you. I feel the same. Things at the house here haven't exactly felt Warm and cheery. I'll see you soon. I'm not letting you leave until you have five bites. At least five. It looks delicious, but I'm not very hungry right now. Well, you weren't hungry yesterday or the day before. I know what's going on here. I'm not anorexic. But you're in grief, And that is just as hard on the body. Okay. I'll take a leg to go. Kaylee, about that message written on the bathroom mirror. Maybe it wasn't meant for you. But I was in the shower. But the girl who wrote it, Did she know it was you in the shower? Just something to think about. Good girl. His phone is toast. You sure? He always took so many pictures of us. He never sent me the last one he took. There must be some way to recover it. I already tried. It's broken. Maybe the case protected it, Or maybe he backed it up to the cloud? I already checked. Wally was lousy about backing stuff up. So, all his last photos and videos are gone. Still smells like him. His terrible, cheap dollar-store cologne That somehow still made him smell so good. It's like he just went out to get a burger, And if we wait long enough, he'll be right back. But he's not coming back. You should keep that jacket. No. I couldn't. Why not? His mom'll just bury it in a closet Or donate it. Wally would want you to have it. I asked him out first, you know? He kept saying no, But lori dared me to keep trying. He always laughed at my bad jokes. He was so easy to talk to. It was like he had been waiting for me His entire life to find him, But now he's gone. I miss him so much. Have you two no shame? Right here in his own bedroom? It's not what it looks like. I just came by to... To steal my son's things? Give me that! Wally was my boyfriend. For how long? A few months? I was married to my husband for ten years before he died, But no one ran to comfort me. They just jeered, Said it was justice that he died. So if you've come to me for sympathy... I'm afraid I'm clean out. Kaylee, come on, let's get out of here. I'm tired of walking on eggshells around this woman. What you say really hurts, you know that? Good. I hope it hurts... Just as much as you hurt him. I never hurt him! Well, somebody put that ghb in his system. My boy never did drugs. And the alcohol? What 18-year-old drinks bourbon? Wally never should have been drinking. I told chase that when I gave him the bottle. The bourbon my son got so drunk on Came from you? It's... it's a tradition. I... we were taking shots, and, uh, Wally must have snuck some when I wasn't looking. To impress the older woman in his life? I'm not that much older. But you are in a position of power. You, the confident, overbearing sorority president, With her eyes on an impressionable young man Here on a baseball scholarship. Did my son really want to date you? Or was he afraid what would happen If he refused your advances? No. You have it all wrong. Do I? Because you may have to prove I'm wrong one day. Now, if you'll excuse me, I want to pack up my dead son's things. By myself. By myself. I think it's time for a lawyer. Could I be charged with something? Well, if you supplied the alcohol wally got drink with, Possibly. Well, sabrina isn't the only one who thinks I had a part in his death. One of the girls in the house wrote a message On my bathroom mirror. It said, "we know you killed wally." Oh, that's just a sick joke. Who makes a joke like that? People who can't properly handle their own grief. Especially jealous girlfriends. Wally didn't have any other girlfriends. What about the girls that he dated before you? You mean in high school? I mean, yeah, he dated other girls, But I was his only girlfriend in college. A loyal fraternity boy. Isn't that an oxymoron? He wasn't like other guys. No? Perhaps he was worse than you thought. The ghb in a drink? I mean, wake up, kaylee. Maybe he wasn't the knight in shining baseball ar... Quick! Get the license plate! Is that guy crazy? He could have accidentally hit us. Was it an accident? I don't get it. Why would someone try to hurt me? Oh, uh, kaylee, you got a package. Oh. I wasn't expecting anything. Let's open 'er up. I really wanna do this right now. What? What's wrong? I know I shouldn't have opened it. I forgot I ordered these costumes for me and wally. We were gonna go as an '80s hair metal band For the masquerade formal we're supposed to have here Next week. What do you mean "supposed to"? You wanna cancel the formal? We host the masquerade every year. Well, how can we throw a party When we've been at each others' throats lately? Uh, we haven't been that bad. Really? You two have been giving me the cold shoulder For weeks now. I'm sorry about that. Okay, we shouldn't have gotten so upset When you questioned us about that message on your mirror. Yeah. And we don't know who the witches are who did that, But once we find out, we're gonna kick their butt. Right on! Now, that's the kind of sisterhood I can get into. No. The last thing this house needs is more conflict. Which is exactly why we need to go forward with the masquerade. Wally wouldn't want us just moping around. He did like a good party. We can hold it in his honor. So... The formal is still on? Yes. But no drinking and no drugs of any kind. The pan-hellenic council is cracking down on all the houses After what happened at the chi house. A sorority formal with no drinking? Lori, I'm serious. Yeah, especially if we want to do this in his honor. Lori, you'll cooperate? Yeah, yeah, I'll try to behave. Do house moms get to come to these things Or do I have to stay locked up in my room? Of course you can come. Oh! I used to wear that stuff for real. Now my old clothes are your costume. Oh. Poor carolyn. No, poor you. Poor you, girl. You just wait and wait Until all the ladies are wearing what you're wearing right now For Halloween. Maybe drinking is overrated. Everyone's having way more fun than I thought they would. Yeah, so am I. I'm glad you talked me into this. I know it's too soon for you to date again, But I'm glad that you're not hiding yourself away. Yeah. Well, it's definitely too soon for me to date, But it does feel good to be social. Avoidance is not the answer. So, who do you think it was? The message on the mirror? Surely you must suspect someone. No. I mean, I love everyone at the theta house. I can't imagine who would do something so mean. You guys are all like my real sisters. But even real sisters stab each other in the back sometimes. Uh, why are you wearing the costume I bought for wally? - I... - It's my fault, um... We were gonna match. Yeah, and I just refused to wear a suit, 'cause, uh, That's what everyone else is gonna wear. So, uh, lori loaned me this instead. Was it a mistake? I mean, you said it yourself, you need to move on. I'll change, yeah. No, I'll just run back to the chi house And grab my toga. No, it's... It's fine. You just surprised me. Come on inside, we'll get you something to drink. Drink what? I heard about the no-alcohol rule. Yeah, exactly, Which is why I will be keeping an eagle eye On everything you drink tonight. Oh! Is this a party or a day care? Oh, ha-ha. Yeah, just kidding. I can't wait to have a juice box. All right. Let's go. Pineapple. It's a nice turnout. Come on, let's party it up, Since this will most likely be my last greek formal ever. Why? You don't graduate till next year. Yeah, about that. We got a notice from our advisor That they are auditing the chi house And may ban us from the college. They can't do that. Of course they can. I mean, they got to set an example for what happened. And they are practically executing me for it. I could be suspended. What? Kaylee, um... Wally died under my watch. I mean, I'm the one responsible. I mean, kicking you out won't bring him back. I mean, I deserve it. I mean, I mean... I was acting like an arrogant jerk, And now I'm being called out for it. So, here's to the cancel culture. I won't just sit back and let them crucify you. Okay? Who do I need to talk to? You'd stand up for me? Yeah, of course I would. I know you'd do the same for me. What are the police doing here? Not just the police. Look who's leading the charge. All right. If the noise is too loud, I can... I can just get the kids to turn it down for you. I'm more interested in the alcohol You're serving to minors. No, ma'am, it's not what you think. There she is. That's the one I was telling you about. Uh, mrs. Lancaster, we aren't doing anything wrong. Can we come inside? We received a report about alcohol consumption. Who reported us? Kaylee, it's fine. Be my guest. Come inside. Wait. We won't just let you do a witch hunt on our house. So you do have something to hide. Hide what? My nephew's birthday party was more scandalous than this And he's only five years old. Come on in, I'll show you around. This war that you're trying to start with me Has to stop, okay? It's one thing to attack me, but now my house too? I'm surprised the house isn't made out of gingerbread. Isn't that how witches like you lure impressionable young boys Into your domain? Mrs. Lancaster, this is hardly fair. And you, chase. My boy adored you, And to see you take her side... There's no side to take. What happened to wally was a terrible accident. And that's all it was, an accident. And how did the ghb get in his system? Did you give it to him? Why are you so insistent that wally was drugged? Because wally would never take something like that on his own. And if you knew him as well as you say you do, You'd already know that. Well, I also knew he was a guy who sometimes took risks. Isn't that what college is for, to make mistakes? The only risk he took was meeting you. Mrs. Lancaster, that's enough. I'm only gonna warn you once. You cannot make false accusations About other people like this. I had every reason to suspect this woman was preying On more young men like my son. Don't bring the law into it unless you have proof, Legitimate proof. So there's no alcohol in there? No drugs of any kind? I think you should be happy. Obviously, these kids are making sure Whatever happened to your son doesn't happen to anyone else. I'm sure if you give 'em a chance, You'll see these kids aren't as bad as you think. Did wally really take those drugs on his own? If he did, he wasn't the son I thought he was, Just like my husband wasn't the man I thought he was either. Sorry to bother you all. Please, carry on with your evening. Mm-hm. Well, I'm gonna see if that stone oven was worth repairing And make some pizza. You hungry? Don't let mrs. Lancaster get to you. She's just letting off steam. Well, it's hard when she's trying to have me arrested. Come on. Let's go inside and have an energy drink And get crazy. You can leave if you want. I know you think this party is lame. Well, trust me. Any party that you're at is definitely not lame. In fact, I'm gonna... Oh my god! Kaylee! Are you okay? I don't think anything will ever be okay again. Bye! No! Don't leave. We're gonna make popcorn and play games. Play games and make popcorn? When did you become my grandma? Come on! It'll be fun. The bars on congress street are also fun. Come on, the night's young And I can't let this outfit go to waste! All right. Have fun. Be good. I won't. - Bye! - Bye. Looks like it's just you and me. It's only 10. I though people would at least stay until midnight. Yeah, the alphas are throwin' a kegger, And so are the sigmas and the deltas. Well, I refuse to believe that all anyone wants to do On greek row is drink beer. No, of course not. They also wanna smoke weed. Are you crazy? The cops were just here. So the chances of them coming back are zero. Besides, it's only a couple grams, it's legal. Oh, and since we're both 21, We can also partake in some of this. No. No way. I don't wanna give sabrina any reason to question my motives. Stuff like this just gives her ammunition. So... What? Am I just supposed to drink more punch? Yeah. Fine. Okay. Whoa! Mm-hm. - That's good. - Okay. Mm. This is what you wanted? Yeah. It is, actually, yeah. My grandpa used to say, "you are nuttier than a squirrel in heat." Uh, I'll just come back later and clean up in here. Uh... I thought... Do you like me? Yeah, I mean, we've been friends for years. You know what I mean. I can't think about another guy right now. It's too soon. Do you think If you and wally had never met That you and I would have a chance? Is it hot in here? Wow. That's original. No, really, are you... are you, like, really hot right now? Mm-kay. If you think that's how You're gonna get me out of my clothes, then... Whoa. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, just... Come on, kaylee. Why'd you never give us a shot? Are your pupils dilated? Oh, you wanna play doctor now? I told you not to drink. I didn't drink. All I had was the punch that you served me, kaylee. Promise. Been a good boy, I swear. Chase? Chase? Oh my god. Chase. Chase! Help! Help! Chase, chase, chase. Call an ambulance! Oh my god. Chase? - What happened? - I don't know. You're gonna be all right. Help! Help! I had no idea chase was epileptic. I mean, that has to be it, right? Unless he's allergic to something. I mean, we did have crawfish today. No way. I've seen chase eat way more shellfish than that. Oh god, what is happening? I can't take it if something happens to chase too. He'll be okay. He's strong. He'll get through this. Well, carolyn. You're just as worried about chase as we are. 'course I am. I'm part of this family too now, aren't I? I need to get to the hospital. What, and sleep on the hospital floor? There's nothing you can do for chase That you can't do right here. Pray. It's better than any prescription I know. I'll make some tea to calm our nerves. I'll bet you by morning, chase'll be good as new. I'm sorry. I don't wanna wake up. Just be careful, kaylee. She's not who you think she is. She's not who you think she is. Kaylee! The police are here. What? Why? Something to do with chase. - Is he dead? - No, he's in the hospital, But ryan said he overdosed on ghb. Excuse me. I need you To step out so we can search this room. Why? She didn't do anything wrong. Just do what he says. He has a warrant. Why are you doing this? It's all right. It will be over soon. What are they looking for? What are they looking for? What's in here? I don't know, I've never seen that before. Positive for ghb. Is this your room? Is this your room? Kaylee quaid, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you In a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, One will be provided for you. Do you understand your rights as I've read them to you? Do you understand your rights as I've read them to you? Who did this to me, huh? I know it was one of you! Why? I love all of you, I would never do anything! I love all of you, I would never do anything! Mom. I didn't do anything wrong. I believe you. Someone put that stuff in my room. I told you not to join that place, didn't I? You'll listen to me now, follow my advice? I bailed you out, so now we do things my way. But I brought you some clothes. So nothing will show on your record And the evidence is inadmissible Since it was found in a room that All the girls who live in that house Have access to. So I'm not being charged with anything? If they wanna to charge you, they have to Charge every sorority sister in your house. It's an impossible case to prove. So, who put the ghb in my room? - Who knows? - And who cares? - I do. - Not after today. Your days at that sorority are over. Mom, someone tried to hurt me, And they did, they got me arrested. Yeah, exactly, which is why you should Stay clear of that place forever. I have to agree with your mother on this, kaylee. Out of sight and out of mind Is the best advice I could give you. What about chase? You think he set you up? No, I... I wanna know how he is. Well, he's not dead, which is good news for you Because a fatality could crack this wide open again, And then the prosecutor wouldn't hesitate To go after every girl in that house. So could he press charges? Possibly, although he did make a statement Swearing that he believes you're innocent Of any wrongdoing. It's because he's a good friend. At least he has my back. Which he could stab at any time. - Mother. - I'm just trying To spare you the pain I went through when... When I dealt with this kind of situation. What, how? I wasn't sexually harassed. Well, not yet, but maybe chase was trying to give you the ghb And accidentally drank it himself. Just because he's a man doesn't mean he's a monster. I'm only trying to protect you. By making me think that everyone I know Is out to get me? Well, somebody is. I have told you, "never trust anyone." Well, I don't wanna live like that. Well, maybe you don't have a choice. Kaylee? I came as soon as I heard your mom bailed you out. I thought everyone abandoned me. No, all the girls are worried sick. Even carolyn's a nervous wreck. But lori, not everyone at the theta house Is worried about me. I mean, who tried to set me up like that and why? Someone tried to kill chase. I don't know who is responsible, But we're all about to pay the price. Did someone else get sick? No, the college is trying to kick us off campus. The council called an emergency meeting tonight To have theta's recognition as an official sorority Of southern u be pulled permanently. Chase said they were trying to do The same thing to the chi house. The chis are fine now, the pressure's off them And now all eyes are on us. Because of me. What time is the meeting? Tonight at 6:30. Okay, we still have time... Did you drive here? Yeah, my car's in the lot. Let's go, we can't let whoever's manipulating this Get away with it. The only place you're going is home with me. We had a deal. Mom, I'm still the president of my sorority. Okay, my sisters are counting on me to help them. You don't have any sisters and I count on you, too. I want you home with me. I can keep you safe. Well, and let whoever did this to me get away with it And let my sisters pay for it by being kicked off of campus? Mom, you didn't teach me to give up. You taught me to fight back. Someone in that sorority wants to hurt you. But a lot of people in that sorority Also wanna protect her. The sorority is strong, we watch over each other, While we still have one. Mom, please, I have to go to this meeting and fight for my sisters. Only person I thought was more stubborn than me Was your father, But I can't say that anymore. You got more conviction than both of your parents Put together. Well, go get 'em. Your grievance isn't with the thetas. Your grievance is with me, And while nothing in my life has brought me as much joy As being a member of the thetas, I will revoke my sisterhood if it will guarantee The rest of my sisters can stay on campus And the sorority won't lose its accreditation. What, kaylee? I won't let you do that. If me leaving means you all get to stay, then... Then I don't want to, Because that's not the theta way. We have each others' backs, No matter what. You taught me that. I agree, if kaylee goes, I go. While the council appreciates The strong sense of sisterhood... We must also take this as a sign That you agree with the unfortunate actions Kaylee quaid has committed, Specifically against the chi fraternity. While this is not criminal court, We must make an example for our community. As of today, southern u no longer recognizes theta house As an accredited sorority. Every member of the theta house must vacate within the next week Before the next sorority takes ownership. This meeting is adjourned. Do you all have any idea what you just gave up? Do you know what we all gained by standing with you? Don't. You'll just make things worse. I don't think that's possible. Did you enjoy the show? Was it everything you hoped it would be Or do you still want a pound of flesh from me? I know you think I hurt wally, But you are the one who hurts him By standing there and gloating While the people who loved him are being punished For a terrible accident. Let's go. Oh, god, oh, god. Ah! Oh, oh. I... I think some... I... somebody was just... I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry to have bothered you. I'm sorry to have bothered you. I guess this is goodbye, for now. Yeah, I love you. I know, you too. Bye, girl. Wait, group hug. - Love you, guys. - Love you. We don't need a sorority to tell us How much we mean to each other. And if that council doesn't like it, I can give 'em directions on where to shove it. Aren't you leaving, too? Uh, I have some more stuff to pack up, Plus, I wanna help carolyn close up the house. I am still theta president after all. You've always been loyal to a fault. This house did not deserve you. - Bye. - Bye. Mrs. Lancaster? You weren't supposed to catch me. What are you doing here? It's wally's phone. I was able to salvage it. I wanted the pictures off of it, But when I started to go through them And saw that the main photo was the two of you, I realized it wasn't my place. I can't take his phone, it's too personal. What's on here was private to wally. Which is why if anyone should have it, It should be you. I think now I know why he was so special to you. I can see it in the pictures he took. Anyway, I think you knew my son better than I did This past year, And so whatever memories are on that phone Of the two of you, They belong to you, Not me. Not me. Chase, you're out of the hospital? Got out two days ago. How are you feeling? Still a bit dizzy, but doc says it'll pass. How are you? That's a loaded question. I know you got arrested. Was it scary? Terrifying And humiliating. Well, at least they didn't convict you. That detective tried to get me to press charges against you, But I know you'd never drug me on purpose. I'm just glad it's over. Can I help you pack up? That's nice, but why? You don't get volunteer points for packing up a sorority That just lost its accreditation. Wasn't that long ago I thought my house Would be the one shutting down and I'd be kicked off campus, But... Instead it's you. Well, what's done is done, And dwelling on it won't fix anything. I'm just glad you're okay. That's all that matters. Ah, isn't moving depressing? I'm gonna make some tea to lighten the mood. You want some? Sure, and put this guy to work. He came by to help us pack up the rest of the house. Chase, are you sure you're in the right condition To help us play moving day? Oh, yeah, um, doc says that I'm fine, And besides, I mean, I owe you ladies my life. If you hadn't called the ambulance when you did... I can't handle any more "what ifs." I'll be upstairs if you need me. Oh, you need help boxing your things? No, just let me cry in peace As I pack away my special memories. So, what else needs to be done? You always took the best pictures of us, wally. Chase, come up here, I wanna show you something. Okay, I'll be up in a sec. Oh, careful, oh, my god. Get that out of here, man, get that thing... Where are we going, man? You're crazy. Not in your face. What the heck? I said get that thing out of here! All right, all right. Jesus, man, that hurt. You don't trust me. What are you talking about? I said you don't trust me. I trust you, chase. Okay, prove it. - Prove it? - Yeah. Isn't that why I'm down here? You're making me wonder why... Why you're even here, man. - You committed? - Yeah, of course. Dude, what are you doing? I wanna show you something. Oh, what do you have in store? What the heck? Going into your dungeon, man. What the hell is happening? You may as well trust me, man. Chase, chase, where is everybody? Isn't this supposed to be some initiation thing? - Try some of this. - What's that? Oh, you'll like it. What is it? I don't want it. It'll make you feel better. - No, I don't want it! - It'll make me Feel better, come on! Dude! Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! Kaylee, what are you looking at? What are you doing on wally's phone? Thought it was broken. How could you do that to him? Kaylee, you need to give me that phone. That video shouldn't even exist. I didn't know he was recording. You gave him the ghb So you could... How could you do that to him? We got out of control, it's not what you think. And what do I think? It was you. You set me up, you put the ghb in the punch And you hid it in my room! They were gonna kick me out of school If they found out that I gave wally the ghb! And sabrina, if she found out, She would think that was the reason why he died And try to throw me in prison! Are you the reason he died? 'course not! You were there, it was just some stupid accident! An accident that wouldn't have happened If wally's judgment wasn't impaired by you! What you made him drink made him do! I didn't want wally to die! I loved that kid like my own brother! This is love? You're sick, chase. I'm gonna make sure everyone knows Just what you did to him! Where you going, kaylee? You need to give me that phone! Stop! Call the police. What? Chase is the one who gave wally the ghb. He's the one who put it in my room, It's been him all along. - You sure? - Kaylee! Don't go. I'm calling the police. In fact, I'm gonna go to the station right now And show them this myself. Carolyn, move, I need to get to the police. I'm sorry, kaylee, But that would get my brother in a lot of trouble, And I've worked too hard to let that happen now. Chase. Chase, help me, please. I'm so sorry. I wish I could, But she would get so mad at me if I did. Who? My sister. Go downstairs and don't let anybody in. What are you gonna do? Are you questioning me? - No, no. - Chase, Are you still in the school? Did I make sure you didn't get arrested? So show some gratitude. If you want your life to remain the way it is And not spend the next 10 years in prison, You'll leave, close the door, And not worry about what I have to do in here To keep you out of trouble. Isn't that why I came here? To help you? To help you? Why didn't you tell me you were his sister? And let all my kittens out of the bag Just to raise suspicion? Come on. The thick accent, the whole southern belle act. I'm actually surprised you didn't figure it out sooner. You don't have the same last name. Mm, I was married. But you're so much... So much older than him. Different mothers. I practically raised chase. Promised I'd always look out for him. Lordy, did he ever test my patience And put that vow to the test. Be careful what you promise to do for others. You were in on this the whole time? And it was working, Until you kissed and made up with wally's mother And she gave you that phone. You see, Just as wally was very precious to you, Chase means everything to me. He is the only family I have And I won't let anything bad happen to him. Do you understand? You're sick. No, honey, I'm smart. Unfortunately you're not, And that's why we have to do this. Do you wanna make the first cut or should I? I never did anything to you. I know. That's why I feel really bad. You really are such a sweet girl. Come on. Bitch! Need you to take this knife And I need you to kill yourself. A suicide makes the most sense. - No. - Yes. You don't have to be alone anymore. You can be with wally. Come on, this is just easy for everyone involved. Don't you agree? Come on. - Come on! - No. Fine, I'll help. Hold still. - Ah! - Kaylee, are you here? We're going to get drinks. Did you text this, did you text her? Yeah, two hours ago, nothing. Maybe her phone died and she's... But her car's parked outside. So? My car's parked at my parents' house And I'm not there. Come on, I wanna go down to mcward's. Okay, fine, whatever, her loss. Help! Someone help me! Ahh, no! No, ahh! You crossed the line, kaylee. You killed my sister. You ruined everything! We could've been so happy together. We could've had it all, And now we have nothing! You? You screwed with the wrong sister. Stop, chase, enough! - You saved me. - Of course I did. Isn't that what a little's supposed to do For her big sister? Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, Speech, speech, speech, speech... Hey, hey, hey, quiet down! That's more like it. It's about time you respected your new house mom. So now can we all hear my daughter Give her speech? "sorority sisters are the siblings God forgot to give us." Now I didn't come up with that saying, But it holds true To how I feel about all of you. Last year we almost lost our sorority, But we fought, literally, To keep it. Thank you for giving me a family. I will cherish all of you forever. Now before I run off to law school, Can we say our theta chant one more time? Because it's not just a rhyme, It's a battle cry. Ahh! T-h-e-t-a, One heart, one way! T-h-e-t-a, We are thetas all the way! T-h-e-t-a, One heart, one way! T-h-e-t-a, We are thetas all the way! Go-o-o-o!
