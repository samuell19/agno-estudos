-Hi! Sorry you missed US! -Charlie's out selling his pocket watch. -And Megan's getting her hair cut. She's gonna spoil everything. -Leave US a message, or we won't call you back. Bye! -Good morning. I'm trying to reach Mr. Charles pipp. This is Marvin Crawford. I'm a personal banker with echo park credit union. The reason for my call this morning is that our records indicate you've been delinquent on payments for the past two months. Furthermore, we believe that due to your recent change of address, our correspondence may not be reaching your purview. It's important that you return our call so that we can resolve this matter before further action is necessary. I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to your timely response. Please call US back at your earliest convenience. Our number is 213-555-4120. Have a nice day and a fantastic weekend. -You get thought, thought, thought, thought, think a, thought, thought, thought, thought, thought, think a, and if this happens regularly enough and long enough, you get the illusion of there being someone who thinks apart from the stream of thoughts which come and go... The stream of experiences. And we use such absurd phrases not only as thinking our thoughts but feeling our feelings, seeing sights, and hearing sounds. But you must understand it is perfectly obvious that seeing a sight is seeing. Hearing a sound is hearing. Feeling a feeling is feeling. So, in the same way, thinking a thought is thinking. But you get split-minded, you see, and so you, get I and me and the I who ought to or must control me, as... Sensation of some real entity that stands aside from thoughts and, chooses among them, controls them, regulates them, and so on. Actually, this is a way to have one thought not controlled. The more there is this duality of the separate thinker standing aside from the thoughts, the separate feeler watching or feeling the feelings, the more the stream of feelings is coaxed into self-protective activity... Into getting more and more like a stuck record. The purposes of which are to protect and to aggrandize... Dislodge the thinker from the supposed thinker. -Hey. Char? -What? Nothing. -And I'm just like, "no, I don't want to drink," and they're like, "yeah, you have to," and they take it like an insult. - Only scotch, right? -Scotch with everything they drink. They drink everything with beer. They drink everything. And they'll put, like, two drinks in front of you, not just one, and I have a hard time... - Excuse me. - Hiya. How are you? -Hey, do you have the Jonathan franzen's book? - "Freedom"? No, that's not it. - "The twenty-seventh city?" That one? - Yes, that one. - Yeah, it's in fiction. I can show you where it is. - Thank you. -You have one new message. Good morning. I'm trying to reach Mr. Charles pipp. -No new messages. -Hi! Sorry you missed US! -Charlie's out selling his pocket watch. -And Megan's getting her hair cut. She's gonna spoil everything. -Leave US a message, or we won't call you back. -Bye! -There you two are. How come I have to find out from your brother that you changed your phone number? Anyway, I'm not calling about that. I'm just calling to, touch base with you because I would love to take you out to lunch with your brother, Ricky. You know that I love my lunches with my special sons. So if you can pull yourself away from the bookstore, um, just pick a day. I will make it work with the gallery. All right? Call me, Charlie. Hi, Meg. Non. Pourquoi? -Parce que... -You ready to go? Let's get your jacket on. - Hi, Sara. - Hi, Charlie. -How are you? - Great. You want to come in? - Yeah, yeah. -We just finished dinner. Do you want a plate? - Yeah, actually. That sounds really good. You know what? Don't get too excited, because it's just chicken potpie, and it's probably cold. So, excuse me. -This looks amazing. -Um, you know what? I think that I'm just gonna, like, go to bed... Or something or, like, take a shower, so you guys have a good night. What'd you do? -It's... Somebody's in the doghouse. -Shut up. -Everything okay, man? What's going on? - Nothing... Just getting off work. Long day. -Yeah. -How's that going? -It's good. We've been busy, so, you know, considering the alternative. -Yeah, but... how's it going? -It's fine, man. We're both adults, you know? I can handle it. Jesus, thank you. Cheers. -Good stuff? God, this is too good. -It's dad's recipe. -Does she call at all? Megan? -Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she calls. -She say anything? - You know, I-I don't... I don't know. I don't get into it. -That's good. Good for her. It's nice. -Hey, are you okay? -Yeah. -You looked like you were having a heart attack. -It's no big deal. -I-It looked kind of like a big deal. I thought for a minute that you passed out there. -I didn't pass out. It was nothing. -Okay, it definitely didn't look like nothing. Are you sure you're all right? -Yeah. What are you reading? "The heart is an Autumn wanderer." -What? -It's the screenplay zooey's reading, that book is... really the only thing I remember. Yeah, I haven't really gotten that far yet. You know, with salinger, I just... Can't really get into whining teenagers anymore. What about "catcher in the rye"? -Yeah, that's actually why I gave this book a chance. "Catcher" was supposed to be so good. -Supposed to be? -It didn't work for me. Please don't tell me you're offended. -Me? No, I'm fine. Every high-school teacher in the country maybe, but you're okay with me. What? -The most celebrated American novel whittled down to whining teenagers. Glowing review. -Yeah, well, I'm not exactly the popular kid in school. You missed your train. Truth or dare? -Um, truth. -Name one thing that you love about yourself and one thing that you hate... Physically. I hate my arms. Why? -I don't know. I do. They're just tiny, and it's upsetting. - Let me see 'em. - No, no. - Let me see 'em. - No. Maybe some other time if you're lucky. -And the thing that you love? -My earlobes. -Don't laugh. They're connectors. They're cute. -They're okay. What is that? -Nothing. It was an accident. Truth or dare? -Truth. -Why did you stop earlier? Why didn't you just keep walking? -I don't know. I like your face. And it looked like you needed help. Truth or dare? -Truth. How'd you get that scar? It was an accident. My dad hit me. Ruptured my eardrum. I never told that to anybody before. -Sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers. -Yeah. Maybe. Truth or dare? -Dare. - A dare. What are you gonna have me do... Run down the street naked or something? - Maybe. I don't know. I was just gonna see about maybe asking you to go another date with me. - Is that what this is... A date? -I don't know. -Truth or dare? -Dare. -Close your eyes. -What are you doing? I'm ready to be an uncle. Uncle Charlie. -Yeah, I'm... I'm ready for a lot of things, too. I used to be ready to be an astronaut. Now I just... I want to work from home and sleep till noon. Maybe play center field for the Dodgers. Only at home games. Think you can work that into your contract? - "Does not travel with team." Yeah. I got pull. I know people. I'll call my lawyer. Jacoby, Jacoby & meyers. - That's good. - Line that right up. -Went and saw dad the other day. Yeah? How was that? -Good. It was good. -Meds still working? -Yeah. -You ever wonder how we managed to dodge that? -Who said we did? You ever think about it? -Do you? -No. -Sara kicked me out. -I'm not kidding. -Shut the fuck up. -She wants me to stay in a hotel for a couple days so I can see how nice I have it. Fuck, man. I'm sorry. Holy shit. I didn't know it was that bad. Yeah, me neither. My god. -The woman's nuts. -You're not staying in any fucking hotel. That's for sure. -That's not why I brought it up so I could get this boo-hoo. I don't... I'm a big boy. - Shut up. Shut up, all right? I got a fold-out couch. You can sleep on that. We need two more. Got to take a piss. Hey... Thanks. What are we doing? -We're walking. -Fair enough. -Hey, it beats going to the movies. How the hell are you supposed to get to know someone sitting in a movie theater? - You like the movies? - Yeah. What kind of movies do you like? -Weird ones. -These trees are really pretty. -They're really dead. But I like the way that they hang. They look like... Kind of like a sad painting or something. -The beauty in death and all that bullshit. -I don't think it's bullshit. I think death can be a really beautiful thing. Did you go out for a drink without me last night? -Yeah. Brother's having some relationship issues. -Rick? -You hear that? Where's it coming from? -Shh, just shut up and listen. -Where is he? -He's there. He just plays. He's there even though we can't see him. -This is why you wanted to bring me here. -Just sharing my world with you. -I like your world. Thank you very much. Thank you. Have a good day. -Thank you. -How is it that you are single? -What makes you think I'm single? Aside from today? How about the fact that you ruined the ending to your books so you could give me your phone number? You give the female population way too much credit. -Okay, so you're not single? -I'm just saying, you shouldn't jump to conclusions over a phone number. I mean, this is L.A. -I'm a handful. -Is that supposed to be a warning? -I have a hard time finding people who can deal with me. That's why I'm single. -She left me. That's why I'm single. Women don't leave men. You pushed her away. You'll probably push me away, too. I mean... That's how relationships go, you know? You get what you need, and you move on. You really believe that? -It's not about believing. It's just how it is. Sooner or later, you break up or you die. Wow. -Don't be whiny. And that's what relationships do. They end. How many relationships have you been in, and how many of them have lasted? I don't care what the answer to the first question is. The answer to the second is always zero. Unless you're currently in a relationship, then it's really only a matter of time. -If you feel that way, well... I mean, why are you even talking to me? What's the point? Why not just... Fucking be alone and avoid all the pain? -You're right. Stop the car. -What? -This is me. -Here? -Yep. -So, this is it? -What else is there, Charlie? -I don't know. You make me feel kind of depressed. -Fuck you. I can't make you feel anything. I don't want you to come inside. -Okay. -Okay. I had a good time with you. -Yeah. Yeah, I had a good time with you, too. It was fun. -Okay. -You have three new messages. First new message. Good morning. I'm... -Message deleted. Next message. -Hey, dude. Just a reminder... book club. Also, can you bring me a bottle of wine so I can get through this? Bring two. I'm broke. I e-mailed everyone already, but you're so stupid, you probably won't get this till you're at work on Monday. I love you. Boy, I'm really nervous as shit. That neighbor boy is supposed to be coming tonight, and I don't want to be an idiot. I'll see you tonight, um, and if you don't come, I'll kill myself, seriously. I don't like anyone else in this group. -Next message. -Hey, it's me. I guess you're out. Bob Ross is on. He's painting another mountain again. Go figure. Anyway, I-I was hoping we could talk. And we should talk. I mean, we should be able to talk to each other maybe sometime over the weekend if you don't already have plans. Um, um... Anyway, um... Bye. -There are no more messages. - Hello? - Hey. -Char, is that you? -Yeah. I just got your message. Sorry, that was stupid. -No, it was cute. -I was just watching TV. -Yeah, I miss Bob Ross, too. Feel like I'm not getting my nature quota. -Yeah, I know. What are you up to? -Nothin'. Is everything okay? -Yeah. -Okay. So... -So... -When do you think we could talk? -I don't know. I haven't though much about it. Haven't wanted to. -Okay. -I don't know what you want me to say, Meg. -I want you to say how you feel. -Is this the part where I'm supposed to... Beg you to come back and tell you I love you and I miss you? No. -Shoot me down, have the power and the upper hand? Is that what's supposed to happen? -Stop, okay? Look, I don't want to fight. -Doesn't work, Meg. You said it. -I guess. I don't know. I'm gonna go. - Yeah. I got to go, too. - Hey. - Hey, what's up? -What are you doing here? I thought you were at work. -Nope. -You eat? No. -Want to grab a bite? I can't. Um, I got a... Thing... Work thing. -What does that mean? It's a book thing. -What's a work thing/book thing? - Book club. - Book club. Do you also need a warm washcloth to wipe the sand out of your pussy? -That's cute. Thank you. It's nice having you around. What'd you do today? Nothin'. -You must've done something. I see you got your clothes on. Um... Well, I-I went out with, Nia. -Who the fuck's Nia? -This girl. Y-you're dating again? Just, I-I met a girl. -When the fuck do I get to meet this Nia? Not the kind you want to introduce to the family? All right. All right. -Hey, call Sara yet? You should call her. -Eat a dick. -Think what I like was, like, the characters, right? It's like, the way he writes them and stuff, he makes it feel like you know these people, right? Like, it's, like, they could be your friends or, like, some family members or people you met in the grocery store or something. So, like, you're kind of vested in them even though they're fucked up sometimes. You still, like, feel like, "okay, they remind me of so-and-so or so-and-so." That's kind of what I like about these guys. -Yeah, but I felt like it was, like, building suspense and, like, da-da-da-da-da, and then, like, nothing. -Well, yeah, it's 500 pages. You know what I mean? A lot of dead space, but, I mean, there's, like... it's... I-It's, like, it's all about h-how he, um, fills in all the spaces of character, you know, like, so you can go back to where it's from and you understand why they're all fucked up or what's going... -But I felt like it was a little redundant. It was, like... -Yeah, I think the beginning was, like, slow as hell to get into it. I hated it, man. They spent like 200 pages on just that one paragraph. -All his others are like that, too, though. They always start off pretty slow. -I don't like books like that, though. -Yeah. -There's so much description and yada-yada. Just, come on, I want to see the grease, the sex. -There was sex. I mean, you know... -There really wasn't a lot of sex. -I mean, it's not a Danielle steel book. -My favorite... Danielle steel... No? I'm alone on that one. -You seem a little bit off tonight. -Yeah, how so? -Well, first of all, you were late. Second, I asked you to bring two bottles of red wine, and you only brought one. And you failed to debate Topher on the finer points of American literature, which I love when... I love when you argue with him. Even if you don't know what you're talking about, I love it. No one else cares, but I care about that. And, also... You're just sitting out here like a sad, wee puppy. If I didn't know better, I would think that you're thinking about Megan Which is mental because in this house, there's a rule. You're not allowed to ponder on your exes. It's not my rule. -I like the book. - You liked it? - I did. - You liked it? Really? - Yeah. -I keep thinking about the kids. Joey and Jessica. -They grow up into these fucked-up little adults, and they never really had a shot from the beginning. Born into their parent's shit, and by the time they realize it, it's too late. They're stuck. -You have to get laid. -You have to release the semen that is weighing you down, man. -You offering? -Shit, no! You wish. -I'm just sitting out here 'cause I'm trying to make neighbor boy jealous. - How's it going? - It's not going. I haven't even talked to him. But he's so cute. -He's not your type. But, seriously... You need to let the sunshine in. Read a Meg cabot novel. Jesus! -What's really going on with you? I can't talk to you about it at work, so... - I'm good. - You're good. - Yeah. - Bullshit you're good. You're good? - I'm good. -Really? I don't believe that for a second. -I wanted a family. What? What the fuck are you talking about now? -I wanted to have a family. -But you have a family. You have me. You have your mom. You have Ricky. That's my family. It's L.A., you know? -That's not what i'm talking about. I wanted the fucking Rockwell painting, you know? I wanted to be a dad. I wanted to have a kid. -Everybody's got their dreams, and ever since I was a kid, that was mine. That's all I ever wanted. -You're gonna get all that. -Yeah, but I kind of thought I was gonna be a young dad. -Well, you could go to Hollywood right now and impregnate some young girl and make all your dreams come true. Don't be so stupid. You're a catch. You're a real catch. -Thank you. Can I borrow your cellphone? - Yeah. -I just want to check my messages. -Why don't you have a phone, though? That's weird. You're such a weirdo. -We all have our reasons, right? -How are you gonna have kids if you don't have a phone? -They're gonna be like, "dad, we need to phone you." -And they don't even have a phone to phone you on. - Yeah, it's good for your bones. - Is it? Yeah, totally. -I have so many bones, so that's good. - I'm really warm. - Me too. -You have a bunch of bones. -Um, I'm going to leave my bike downstairs. I got to go meet a friend if that's okay. - A friend? - Yeah, a friend. There's a little party. -Yeah, okay. Just leave it outside, babe. -Great. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt. -So, calcium for, what did you say... red wine? Red wine. -How about you? What do you drink? What's your drink of choice? -I don't drink ever, really. -Hi. -Hi. I was a little surprised to hear from you. -I know. I broke the 24-hour rule. -Get over it. I wanted to see you. -So, there's a party? -Whoo! -How do you know all these people? -I don't, really. -Are you kidding? -Does anyone really know anyone, Charlie? -Wow. This view's amazing. -Should we do it? Should we just end it all right here, right now? -I think maybe we should get a drink first. I make his... Ooh, sorry. -You guys in line? - Well, in line for what is the question. Would you like one of these? -Um... I-I think I'm good. -So am I. So are we, right? Hey, it's just ecstasy, man. -Why don't you have one of these? -Listen, I thought maybe taking a bathroom break real quick... -You want to take a bathroom break real quick? Okay. -And when I come back, I promise you and I... -And you know what? Let me tell you something. Everything's good. -I know, I know. -Okay, what you want to do is, is you want to take this. You know, I can't tell you... Hey, man. How you doing? -Ready? -Yeah. Hey... Listen, I-I haven't talked to mom yet about Sara. You mind not bringing it up? -Why? -'Cause it's mom. I don't want to deal with her, and we're gonna work everything out, so I... I don't want her shit on top of it. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. -Anyway, the work is brilliant. It is brilliant. He is doing unbelievable things with textures an-and layers. The layers you just would not believe. Charlie, they're so amazing. It's grays, and it's pinks, and it's pastels. Never seen anything like it. Not on canvas. I would love to bring both of you guys there. I'd love to walk you through it. So? Give me the details. What's going on? Sara, Megan? -They're good, mom. They're both very happy. - Yeah. -Wonderful. That's lovely. I don't know why they never come along on our little lunch dates. -Because you never invite them till after we've ordered. -Ricky, that's not fair. Don't be harsh. We're all adults. They have an open invite. They know it. -I'm just saying, you could put forth a little more effort. It's not a big deal. -Margaret Phillips had a fundraiser at her house. You'll never guess what she still had up on her wall. The first piece you ever sold, Charlie. You were only 14 years old. You remember? Yes, I do. You know you can be working. -Mom, come on. -Mom what? Mom what? I don't know how many times I can say it. We need to do a show. -I just can't think about anything else right now. I'm sorry. Got a lot on my plate. -Sounds like your father. I just want you boys to be successful. -We are successful. We just see it a different way than you. -Thank you for lunch, mom. -Is this too early to get a glass of wine or something? - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Um, how was the party? - It was good. It was good. I had a good time. It was fun. -There's something different about you. Me? -Um... I don't know. -Is it... ooh, is it your teeth? Is there something, like, major between your teeth? -Get it? No, that's not it. - I think it might be the masks. - Ooh! -We just got them in, but you have to put it on right now. -Can't wait, can't wait. Are you ready? Look at my new life. Yeah! Fucking work. We got to get him later. -We'll get the next one. - Where? - That way. Hey, can I ask you something? Honestly? -Yeah. -Do you think I'm pretty? -Why? -Just that guy the other night at the club. -Neighbor boy. -The neighbor... He's not interested, so... -Yeah. I think you're pretty. Hello? What's up? -I'm sorry. I got crazy the other night. I was fucked up. I can be hard to deal with, remember? Don't hate me, Charlie. You can't turn your back on this. -Or what? -Charlie... I need you. Close your eyes. Promise me it'll always be like this. -Like what? -Just this. -All right. -Charlie. -Morning. -What are you doing? -It's supposed to rain, so I thought I'd give you a ride. -How'd you know I even live here? -Sara. -Charlie, I'm just trying to be friendly. Quit trying to make me feel crazy. -I can't make you feel anything. Let me get ready, okay? -Can I come in? No, no. Rick's asleep on the couch. Wait down at your car. I'll be down there in a couple minutes. -Okay. -Does she know about me? -No. Not yet. -Well, do you want her to? -Yes, I just... I don't want her to find out like this, okay? -Don't hide me, Charlie. Promise. -I promise. I promise. -♪ baby always saw musicians as so self-important ♪ -you know, you didn't have to bring your bike. I could've given you a ride after work. -It's cool. Thank you. -♪ baby and I used to turn on the radio almost every morning ♪ ♪ knocking out... ♪ Hey. I was listening to that. -I just don't want to listen to any commercials right now. -All right. Hey, Charlie, how come you haven't told your mom about US? She called me. How come you never told me you used to go to a shrink? -What? -Okay, fine, a psychiatrist. -What the fuck are you talking about? -Don't yell at me. She told me. -I'm... I'm not yelling at you. Why would she tell you that? -I-I don't know. She didn't mean anything by it. She just... She just told me. -Why are you two even talking to each other? Can you just stop yelling at me? I told you, she called me. -You two hate each other. -We don't have each other. -You couldn't stand to be in the same room together going on five years. Now you're calling each other? About my medical history? -Okay, Charlie, just stop it. What the fuck? What else do you guys talk about? -Charlie, she's just worried about you, and she cares about you. We both do. You don't get to do that anymore, Megan. You chose this, not me. I... think it would be a good idea for you to talk to someone. Like you have any idea what would be good for me. Come on. I'm just trying to help. -Charlie? All right, so, who's excited for story time? -Yeah! All right, so, today, we're gonna read "the extraordinary boy," and Charlie's gonna read it to you guys. - "The extraordinary boy." "Once, in a town that resembled that of any ordinary town, lived an imagination. The imagination found a home inside the head of a small boy that resembled that of any ordinary boy, except that the imagination made the boy anything but ordinary. In fact, the imagination was so powerful that it made the boy extraordinary. And the boy had a mother who lived with him and fed him. The boy's mother took very good care of him and worked very hard to pay their bills. The boy knew that his mother was not able to see the imagination that lived inside his head." You forgot your shoe, young lady. -You are not gonna make it far without that. Did you like the book? No? She did. -It was really great. I was totally entertained. -Well, good. That's half of it. I don't know if she cares, but whatever. Of course she does. -She loves it. She always talks about coming to story time here. -Good. Well, we'll see you guys next week? - Yeah, totally. - Awesome. - All right, have a good one. - Bye. -You're the best friend ever. -Who you talking to, buddy? -Michael. -Who's Michael? -My best friend. Is he here right now? -Yeah, but you can't see him. -Can your mom and dad see Michael? Well, you tell Michael I said hello, okay? -Do you have an imaginary friend? No, I don't. -Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. -And don't worry about it. Don't w... I'm fine! We're fine! Everybody's fine! I'm staying on his couch. He's... No, don't... D-D-Don't do... hello? H... -That Sara? -It was mom. -What's going on? -She knows. She's coming over. -Are you fucking kidding me? -You didn't tell me you were an artist. -Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. -I'm an artist, too. I made this for you. -What are you still doing here? -I got scared, so I never left. Why? What's wrong? Charlie? Charlie?! -Quiet. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Shh! - I'm going away, aren't I? - Shh! -You don't... you don't want to tell them about me, do you? You don't want your mom to know about me, do you?! - Quiet. - I'm gonna go tell her, I'm gonna go tell her. -Shut your mouth. My mother is gonna be here any minute. You're a crazy person, Charlie. -You're not bleeding. -Do you want me to bleed? -What'd you do today? -Waited for you. -You don't have to cry. -What do you want me to do? -What's wrong? -A lot of things. -We're fine, mom, seriously. -You're not fine, Charlie. This isn't fine. Look how you're living. You've both been kicked to the curb. - What did you do? - We didn't do anything. -Well, maybe that's the problem. -Mom, stop. -No, you stop. Both of you. Stop with all the lies and the secrets. -No one lied. We didn't want to say anything to you until things were final. -Well, this is pretty final. -I-It's not. Char is working things out. Sara just needed a couple days to herself. -Well, how long has it been? A couple days. -And you, Charlie, how long has it been? -A month. -A month? God. God. -What? Goddamn you, Gary. Goddamn you, Gary. -No, stop. It has nothing to do with him. We're fine. Look at US. We're fine. -You're not fine. Look at yourselves. 25 years ago, he said he was fine. And then one day, he wasn't. -Not the same. -No, it's not the same thing, Rick. But it's a loss. And loss is stress. And stress is the same thing. I don't want you boys to end up... I don't want you to go through... I've got to collect myself. I need to use the washroom. -I don't know. Look, char. Megan may be perfect, but she wasn't perfect for you, okay? She's wasn't whether you like it or not. And you weren't perfect for her, either. -Where the fuck was that information three years ago? - Fuck, three months ago? - Okay, sorry, but it's not like you would've listened to me anyway. You guys were all like ga-ga, ga-ga. -You still think I want to be with her, don't you? - Don't you? - No. I don't. I don't even want to think about her anymore. -Good. - I'm freaking out, man. - What does that mean? -Just feel like I'm living a-a lie. - You're not living a lie. - That's bullshit. That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm lying to myself about... what kind of person she is. She's lying to me about what she needed from me, and you fucking knew it the whole time. - Hey! - You saw, and you didn't say shit! -Hey, don't blame me. Now you sound like mom blaming everybody else for their problems. -I'm not blaming you, okay? I pushed her away. That's what men do. So, y left her? -Maybe. Yeah, maybe I did on some level. Maybe I checked out early. Man, don't act like you fucking know. You're no different. You don't know shit. Sorry. -No. No. What do I know? I'm sleeping on your fucking couch. -You miss her, don't you? -Yeah. Yeah, she does this, um... Thing when she's dreaming. She squeaks. I miss that. I miss that, you know? I don't want to have to learn that crap about someone else. - You boys all right? - Yeah. -Need another pitcher? -No, I don't think so. Just the check will be good. -All right. -Thank you. -The point is, you get one life. And it's up to you to decide what you want to do with it, so take control of that. But you deserve to be happy. Everyone does. Find out what it is that makes you feel that way and surrender to that. -What? What are you smiling ab... -Hey, guys. - How you doing, Sara? - Hi. - No, no, no. You don't have to go. I was just, like... - No. I want to. It's good to see you. -It's good to see you, too. -Please. You look amazing. You always say that. -You always look amazing. -Charlie. Hey. -Hey. Did you just eat? - Yeah. Yeah, we just finished. Well, I'm supposed to meet Sara inside. - Yeah, she's inside. She's talking to Rick. - Really? - Yeah. - That's good. They needed to talk. Hey I want to apologize for earlier. -It's okay. I get it. -No, i-it's not okay. I was wrong. I'm sorry. -Um... I should probably get inside. -Yeah. Good night. -Good night. Hey, Charlie, do you want to just... I don't know... Come inside and hang out, have a drink while we eat? - Um... - Okay, I get it. -It's just that we just finished in there. -Yeah, yeah, you're... You're probably right. Um... I miss you, and I-I miss this. -I miss you, too. Come here. Have a good night. -You too. -You disappeared. -I could tell you were scared. You can't stop the rain, Charlie. -What's that supposed to mean? -Just that. Some things just happen. You can't fight it. You can't run from who you are. Hey. Hey. How'd it go? -Great. We talked, or I guess I-I listened i-is what I needed to do. -Good. So, what's the deal... I get to kick you out of my place yet, or what? -No, not yet. I-I still have to go on a few more dates with my wife before she'll let me move back in. -What's going on? You were right about earlier, man. I got to get my shit together. I'm fucking drowning here, man. I'm fucking drowning. -No, no, no. Look, I understand you miss her. It's okay. It's okay. -I just need a couple minutes to myself, okay? -Yeah. Yeah. - Thank you. - No problem. -Thank you.
