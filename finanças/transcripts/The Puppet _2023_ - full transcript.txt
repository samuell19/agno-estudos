There's a mansion where you're going. The owner is Huang Dacheng, the head of the opera troupe in our Yuanyao Village. One year ago, his daughter jumped into the river with a puppet. The director blamed himself so much that he refused to let her be buried. He stayed by her side for three days and nights. Until that night, two coroners came to examine the body. Follow the rules. OK. Like you're here, so please forgive us. I know the rules. Please, don't mess with us. Please accept our sacrifices. There's a wound at the back of her head. Uncle. Uncle! Uncle! Run! Run! Hurry up! If you don't leave now... Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open... The village head, Fourth Master, my cousin, Jiu, and I rushed to the scene, and we found that the old coroner had drowned in that basin of grapefruit leaf water. His nephew had hung himself. Jiu was the master who knew this best in all the towns. He also advised us to cremate Man's body right away. You can't burn her! Jiu. I know you want to help me. But I am the one who drove my daughter to a dead end. Now, I'll do anything. I just want to keep my daughter by my side. Uncle Jiu said that this secret spell was extremely sinister, and only the closest relative could be present. So, the village head and I had to avoid it. To summon the soul back to the body, we must use the blood of a crow to lure her soul out at the most Yin time. The puppets are inherently sinister, and your daughter died with one. It's most suitable to be the vessel. Remember, after she appears, smear your blood on the top of her head to trap her soul. After we cremate your daughter's body, her soul will stay in this puppet. Then she can be with you forever. She's back. What should we do? Leading her soul to the puppet. Use your blood to trap her soul! Now! She harbors too much resentment. Hang in there! [Wait for me to requite you in the mortal world] It's half an hour until 5. I'll burn her first. Man. When it was 6, we returned to the Huang Residence as Uncle Jiu ordered, only to find that Uncle Jiu was long dead. No one dares come here since. Because the puppet comes alive, strangers don't come near. [The Puppet] I don't want to hear it anymore. Uncle Sun, stop talking. You scared my baby. There aren't so many ghosts. Have you seen one? You don't believe it? There are things you don't believe because you've never met them. Stop talking nonsense. Don't be afraid. Uncle Sun. Thank you for coming to take us to the village. If there really is a ghost, I want to meet her too. Qianqian. It's getting late. Let’s go. Our village doesn’t welcome outsiders. In fact, we came here this time because of the special plants near the village. We will respect the local customs. Why is there no audience for the opera? Sometimes opera is not for humans. Isn't it for the ghosts? Enough. What a sin! You ruined our ritual. She won't let you go, either. You will be punished. I'll arrest anyone who dares to lay a finger on her. Do you hear me? People, don't act recklessly. Captain Yu. Let me handle it. Go. All go home. Qianqian, are you okay? Captain Yu, you know about Man's suicide too. Her death anniversary is coming. The villagers came to worship the puppet voluntarily for peace of mind. I don't want to hear or care about that. Anyway, just take care of my friends. You can deal with the rest at will. Welcome, Mr. Wu. This is the village head, Fourth Master. He will arrange everything for you. Fourth Master. Thank you for taking us. May I know where we can stay? Follow me. The only place you can stay is the Huang Residence on the island. Don't touch the puppets for the opera. Isn't that the haunted house Uncle Sun mentioned? I don't want to stay there. Our teacher told us that we should believe in science and fight against superstition. It's quite pretty. It's impressive. Welcome to the Huang Residence. Welcome. It's the right house for me. You're not afraid now? I'm still a little scared. All right. I'm here. There's nothing to be afraid of. Look how beautiful the scenery is. Yes, it is. But I still think it's so creepy. Let's go. [Jiangxia Huang Residence] Carry them in. This must be the house of that troupe director. You go in first. I'll go tidy up your rooms. Thank you. I've cleaned up four rooms for you. But the side hall is a worship room for Man's puppet. [Jiangxia Huang Residence] Don't go there. There are so many puppets in this house. Please bless me with a good night's sleep. I'm exhausted. These puppets are everywhere. It's okay. Don't be afraid. This small place is not as good as Shanghai. I think it's moving. It's fine. All right. We can't see it now. What are you doing? What do you think? You're so wicked. Why are you blushing? I'm excited. Be quiet. Blueprint solution. [Rouge Debt] Why are your hands so cold? Look. Are they good on me? Zihua! Ghosts! Wake up! Wake up! What happened? Don't be afraid. The vase is moving itself. There are ghosts! Let me check it out. There's nothing here. You think too much. Are you too tired? Call for help! Help! Help! Don't breathe. Don't talk. Go! Go! Don't stay! Long. Man. Don't harm people. Go! Look carefully. She's not Man. I'm not Man. Granny. You're not her. You're not her. Man. Here you are. Take it. Be safe. Be safe. She's my wife. Sorry for disturbing you. Are you okay? I saw a special flower at the dock today. Its fragrance can easily make people hallucinate. I haven't figured out what kind of flower it is yet. But I think it's the scent of these flowers that makes people hallucinate. But something really dragged me down. You saw too many weird things today. You were just too scared. She's right. I lay down and slept until now. Nothing happened. Just like the teacher said, we should trust in science. Alright, don't think too much. Rest early. Let's go for a trip tomorrow morning. After that, let's go back early. But I'm really scared. I'm so scared. Let's go. Go. I'm so scared. How can I sleep? Have you come up with a solution? I don't care. If you can't solve it, we'll break up. Don't be angry, Yanyan. I have an idea. They said it was the puppet that caused the trouble. Is there any way to suppress that puppet and counteract evil force? Didn't the storytellers always say that? Black dogs' blood can do. The lad urine can also do. It's hard to find a black dog's blood. But it's not hard to find the lad urine. The lad urine? Is my urine still the lad urine? If your urine isn't, who else's urine is? Here. It should be enough, right? What? Do you want me to pour water for you? Why is there no response? What response do you want? Should it bow to you? Let's go. Let's go. [Jiangxia Huang Residence] I didn't sleep at all last night. That mansion is so scary. I really don't want to live there tonight. Let's finish early today and go back early. Man. I know you died in vain. I promise I will help you so that you can be reborn soon. I promise you. I will definitely report to the police for you. I will! I will! It's my turn, right? I know you will take me away. Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu. You came so early? Fourth Master, why are you... Captain Yu asked us to entertain you well. There are many poisonous insects and ants in the mountain. So we're here to lead the way. Fourth Master is so nice. We are used to it. By the way, what kind of flower field is that on the opposite mountain? That's just some local wildflowers. The mountain road there is rough and rarely visited. Why don't we go east along this road? Let's go. Thank you. Come here. Okay. Where is Qianqian? Qianqian. Qianqian. Qianqian. Qianqian. Teacher. Look. Qianqian. No. Don't go over there. It's haunted. This well is… This is Mr. Huang’s daughter, Huang Xiaoman's cenotaph. The villagers think this place is haunted. So no one dares to come here. Mr. Wu. Look at these bougainvilleas. Don't touch them. The elderly said the tender branches grow on the graves of those who died early, while flowers and vines grow on the graves of those who were hanged. The flowers are so vigorous. It's greatly inauspicious. You will be unlucky if you touch them. Zhao Fei. Are you okay? Madam Long? What happened? Long. Long! Long! It's you! You killed my wife! Sun. It's none of their business. We just found her. Why is it none of their business? They must have done something and offended Man. Otherwise, my wife wouldn't have died. Man must be back. You will kill the whole village. Help Sun back to rest. I told you it's haunted. A homicide has occurred now. I don't think you can stay here. Pack up quickly. I'll arrange a boat to take you away before dark. Where did you find these photos? I found them in this house. I heard Miss Huang went to the city to study before. I think she tookthese photos. Don't think too much about that. Let's go. Let's go. Teacher. Let's go. What the hell? We've been waiting for hours. The boat hasn't arrived yet. Is there any other way out? There should be only one waterway. Then we can't leave today? I'll never go back to that haunted house. I want to go home. Teacher. It's going to rain. Let's go back first. Let's go. Let's go. I don't want to go back. Go back and take shelter from the rain first. Madam Long died miserably today. Is Director Huang’s daughter really back? Even if she comes back, she may not harm us. We didn't really disturb her. Oh no. Can we survive tonight? I heard from old men that when the rooster crows at six o'clock, there will be no ghost. Screw you! Are you done shouting? Before the ghost arrives, I will be scared to death by you first I've had enough of you. Don't speak so loudly to my girlfriend. I've been enduring her for a long time, too. If it wasn't her idea to splash that puppet with my lad urine, would it have ended up like this? It was your urine. Every injustice has its perpetrator. You should die first. Fine. It was my urine. But your boyfriend splashed the puppet. He should die too. Also, you asked me to do it. You'll die too. Fine. Let's die together tonight. Okay. Let's die together. Zhao Fei. Enough! I told you to be respectful. Are these things you have done worthy of the books you've read? Mr. Wu. Everyone is so scared. But we have to stay here tonight. What should we do? Light up all the lights tonight. All of you don't leave the lobby. We'll leave at dawn. The reason why people fear ghosts is because they are afraid of death. The fear brought about by ghosts is A matter of cognitive limitations. As materialists, we must realize fear is not real. The only thing worth fear is the fear itself. But please believe what you see right now may just be the tip of the iceberg of truth. Once you know it clearly, you can confront fear directly. Open your heart, leave nothing behind but me alone. What happened? Why did the candle suddenly go out? It's okay. It's windy outside. They were blown out. Zhao Fei, close the door and windows. Zihua. Let's light up the lights in the lobby. Okay. It's okay, Yanzi. Zihua. Qianqian! Are you okay? This is my favorite song. It's like you're possessed by a ghost. Don't scare me. I'm Qianqian. Then do you know us? Zhao Fei. Yanzi. Zihua. I know you. I don't understand what you're afraid of. See? She has a shadow. It's okay. Take a rest. Qianqian. Are you okay? I don't know. Have you noticed that although housekeeper Sun was the last one to arrive, I found that his pants were stuck with Bidens pilosa only found in Man's cemetery. Before we arrived, he might have come there. Why did he lie? What did he try to hide from Madam Long's death? Without solid evidence, we can't hastily conclude. I have a feeling that someone is playing tricks. After we leave here tomorrow, let's inform Captain Yu to investigate this thoroughly. It's dawn already. It's six o'clock. 6 o'clock. We're fine now. We are all safe. Great. But why isn't it dawn? It's six o'clock. The rooster has crowed. The weather is bad. All of you are suspicious. I'm so tired and couldn't sleep. Zhao Fei. Where are you going? Mr. Wu. I didn't sleep all night. Let me sleep for a while in the room. Go back to the room? Aren't you afraid? It's six o'clock. It's dawn. The ghost should have slept now. Well. Let's take a break. Wait for Fourth Master at the dock later. Damn you! Why did she take these photos? What did she see? Time to go. Zhao Fei. Get up. Let's go. It's past six. Why are there still ghosts? It's only five o'clock now. Something is wrong with the clock. I don't want to die here. I don't want to die here. No one can leave. Before dawn, we will all die. What should we do, Mr. Wu? Calm down. Let's go. Hurry up. Go to the dock. Let's go. Hurry. The door wasn't locked before. Have anyone seen the key? I think I saw it in the storage room. I'll get it. I'll go with you. I'll go by myself. Sir, please look for other exits. Be careful and make sure to come back soon. Got it. Let's check if there's any other exit. Wait! Nature calls! Now? Are you serious? I didn't dare to go to the restroom all night. Alright, let's go. Let's go. What's wrong? It's looking at me. I am not at ease. I'm here. Don't be afraid. Wait a moment. It is less scary now, right? Hurry up. Be careful. Is it you, Zihua? Zihua? Say something. Zihua? Zihua? Let's go. Yanzi. Don't scare me. Yanzi! Help! Help! Help! Where are Zihua and Yanzi? Yanzi. Yanzi. Yanzi. Let's go! Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry! Go! This way. Help! Help! Help! Help me! Man. Man. Man. I know I was wrong. Please let me go. Please spare my life! Zihua. Zihua. Please forgive me. Don't blame me. Wait for me. I'll burn more joss paper for you. Zihua. Yanzi. Zihua. Zihua. Wait for me! Zihua. Zihua. Zihua. Yanzi! Yanzi! Great! Yanzi, you're still alive! Great. How can I live without you? Yanzi. Yanzi. Yanzi. Why? Zihua. Zihua. Zihua. Zihua. Zihua. Qianqian. Mr. Wu. Qianqian. Zihua. Qianqian. Zihua. I don't care what you are. Don't come any closer. Man, come here. I've been looking for you. I know you have something to tell me. Let me help you. Okay? Are you waiting for me? I'm sorry. How long will you go back this time? For a while. I haven't seen my dad for two years. I miss him. This is for you. Although you can't talk, you can use the camera to express yourself with photos. You said your hometown is beautiful. Take more photos and pick the most beautiful one for me. I really have to get on the train. Look. It'll be decent when you meet your dad. Will you come back? Goodbye. When the whistle rings, you'll be by my side. Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu. Qianqian. What happened? I don't know. You... You're awake. I'm Huang Dacheng. Did you see my daughter, Man, last night? What on earth happened? I saw you talking to yourself by the river and then jumped into the river. And you were burning yourself with the oil lamp. Last night, there must be ghosts covering your eyes. Impossible. There are no ghosts in this world. But I think I saw Man last night. She seems to have a lot to tell me. You really met Man? What did she want to tell you? Why didn't she come to see me? Is she still mad at me? Man, I didn't mean it. -Don't be mad at me, Man. -Uncle, it's not like that. Don't blame yourself. By the way, I want to know why you have Man's whistle? Man gave it to me. Qianqian. You know her? She's my best friend. But I didn't expect seeing her off that day was the last time we met. I don't believe she would die by suicide. So I must come here to find out the truth. Uncle, can you tell us what on earth happened on the night Man died? I'll drink up first. Master, a toast to you. Thank you for what you did. My pleasure. Come on, let’s drink. Bad news, Director! Miss burned the puppet! If I hadn't been drunk that night, I wouldn't have slapped her. The next day, I heard about her death. It was all my fault. If it weren't for the puppet, she wouldn't have died tragically. I was too selfish. I wanted to keep my daughter by my side. So I arranged the religious rite. But I didn't expect that several innocent lives got killed, which made the villagers panic. I really don't know what to do. Looks like we have to find the village head to solve the problem. Today is her death anniversary. What should we do? Village head, what should we do now? Will Man come back and kill us all? We should do something. Everyone, calm down. Stay at home tonight. Don't come over. We will find a way to ensure your safety. All right. Go back. Fourth Master. I was late to pick you up yesterday and couldn't come over because of the heavy rain. I didn’t expect… So it was Director Huang who saved you last night? Yes. He thinks Man will come back tonight to do something terrible. Fourth Master. We came here to find a solution. Sun. Did your cousin, Jiu, leave any way out? Steward Sun, it was our fault. But it's a matter of life and death. Only you can help us now. There is a way. But Man's closest relative will be needed. I wonder if Director Huang will agree. I’m ready. Master. Everything started because of me. If I hadn't wanted to keep Man by my side, I wouldn't have killed so many people. Sun, please send Man off for me. Today is Man's death anniversary, when we need to completely burn the puppet possessed by her at the moment full of the strongest Yin in the place with the extreme Yin. But since Man has turned into a fierce ghost, evil and tricky, she will definitely destroy the ritual. You need to prepare these things. The ink marker string immersed in dog blood. The item with the strongest Yang enshrined in the temple in the village, the alter cloth. Then, I will use the blood of the closest relative to draw a spell on the puppet to suppress her, and give it to her closest relative. -Master Huang sent her off. -In fact, Man... She never blamed you. Remember, no one else should touch the puppet except for Master. And don't let the puppet fall onto the ground. It's time! The evil spirits disobeyed my order. You'll be suppressed forever under the Mount Tai Stone! Send it off. Three of the incense sticks are longer while another two are shorter. It's a bad omen! Hurry up! It'll be bad if we miss the right time! Director! Hang in there! Don't let the puppet fall onto the ground! Qianqian! Man. Man really comes back to life. Don't come near me! Don't come near me! Don't come near me! Daughter, don't do this. Don't hurt any more people, Daughter. Daughter. Dad. I'm here. If you want to kill them, kill me first. Kill me first! Don't kill her. Qianqian will die if you kill her. If I don't kill her, how will I send your daughter off? Don't kill me, Fourth Master. I'm Qianqian. Qianqian! Qianqian! You really killed her. Did I kill her? Man did. Man killed everyone. Also, you and he will be both killed by Man. What did you say? I said Man killed everyone. Except Man. I killed her. Didn't she commit suicide? It's her fault for knowing something she shouldn't have known. How about I sending you down and you asking her yourself? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? How could this happen? Turns out you killed Man. How did it feel to have hallucinations? Hallucinations? What hallucinations? What are you talking about? Your antidote has been switched by us since earlier. You dropped something. Turns out you killed Man. Man didn't come back to life. Everything was done by human beings. There are no ghosts nor a scary puppet legend in the world. Huang Silang, the village head, and Sun Haichao, the steward, started all of it! You don't have any evidence. Captain Yu, will you arrest us with a one-sided statement? Yes. Without evidence, we wouldn't accuse you. Here's the evidence. [Traumatic bleeding shock, caused by hits] This is Man's autopsy report. It clearly shows although the body's lung was soaked, the wound caused by the hard object that was found in the back of her head was her fatal injury. It's really Uncle Qiu's handwriting. I watched Man growing up. Why would I kill her? Because she saw something she shouldn't have seen. This photo was taken by Man by accident. It recorded the scene where Fourth Master traded with the Westerners. And the trade was selling children. On the night when Man burned his puppet according to Director Huang, she was collecting evidence. But because she couldn't speak, Director Huang misunderstood her. At this time, Fourth Master had found out Man knew your secret. [I'm reporting the village head of Yangfa to you.] So you killed Man, dumped her by the river, and made the scene look like suicide. The Westerners and I were doing medicinal materials business. The photos she took are all of the medicinal materials. Don't frame us like this. Move it up! This is the puppet box I found in Huang family's storage room. All these years, you have kidnapped children in the name of a puppet play in different places, and hidden them in the box. And Man's tomb. I knew something was wrong when I was at the scene. It's impossible for flowers to flourish near the lonely tomb. Especially in Man's tomb, there's no body at all. As expected, I found these in the tomb this morning. These are the children who died of suffocation on the way. After Man died, you used the villagers' fear of Man to pour the children's bones into the well. Then no one would find out. [No.17 Cai Yang February 16th Huang Cui is timid. Yang Zhaoyu was sold at the price of 62. Well, about this, you have nothing to say, do you? The record for selling the children. Not everyone would do something evil like you! Bodhisattva, please bless me. Madam Long has always felt guilty. So she has collected evidence secretly. Being safe and sound. All the evidence is put in the amulet Madam Long gave me. They made ghosts a scapegoat. Now it's time for the ghosts to appear. Ghosts appear after the smell of the incense first. The incense that can make people hallucinate. The incense is made from the flower. The first time I saw it was at the dock. The second time was when I collected folk songs and you introduced your private garden to me. I've checked it. It's a thorn apple that makes people hallucinate. The incense that can make hallucinations made by the mixture of thorn apple and other ingredients is an important tool for you to kill. The first victim is the coroner. You were worried that the coroner would find clues during the autopsy. So you first killed them through hallucinations, and then made Man a scapegoat. Then you leveraged the fact that Master Huang missed his daughter too much to perform the soul-summoning ritual with Uncle Jiu, and then killed Uncle Jiu, making others think Man came back to life. Then you killed Madam Long. Why would I kill my wife? When we arrived that day, we found traces of someone worshipping at the tomb. It should be Madam Long's confession in front of Man's tomb. You were worried that she would let it out when she met us. So you killed her. But you didn't have time to deal with the body. So you hung her on a tree. You're lying! I was the last to arrive that day. This indicates your weakness. In the whole village, only Man's tomb has Bidens pilosa. When you came that day, I saw them on your pants. This proves that you've been here before. In fact, after Madam Long died, we wanted to leave. But before we left, we found the photos Man took. So you changed your plan and decided to kill us. You told us not to leave this place and kept using horror legend to strengthen our psychological hints and enlarge our fear. After we went back to our room that night, you lit the incense and made everyone hallucinate, letting them believe that ghosts were after their lives. They all hurt themselves by choking their throat, biting their tongue, hitting a tree, and committing suicide. You killed three of my students in this way. Luckily, Master Huang saved Qianqian and me and reminded me of the flower field. This morning, we analyzed the whole story and found that everything was your conspiracy. But there was no way to prove your crime. So, we decided to give you some of your own medicine. We planned a big show to force you to confess in front of everyone. Why do you have the antidote? Because I have it too. On the first night, other than me, everyone encountered strange things. When we entered the Huang mansion, Steward Sun used this incense to make us hallucinate. But these puppets are alive. They can move! It was a hallucination. There's no puppet that can move or a black ghost hand in reality, nor a group of ghosts in costumes. I didn't hallucinate because I was not in a good mood and applied a balm. And the balm from Southeast Asia has a strong refreshing effect. It's the best antidote to disperse the effect of the thorn apple. So today, everyone here, except you and Steward Sun, had applied the balm. Not the evil ghost haunted the puppet but your greedy soul. The scariest thing in this world is not ghosts, but human hearts. Our nation has thousands of years of feudal ruling history with corrupted feudalism ideology, which is the deep soil of ghosts and gods. In this case, Fourth Master can take a chance to create a horror legend. So, we should keep advocating a scientific spirit and objecting to foolishness. We should insist on that! Yes. I made a mistake this time. When I first saw you, I knew something would happen. I should have killed you at first! Sun. Let's go. Director! Director! Dad. I'm back. Mr. Wu, I want to worship Man again. It's late at night. In the deep forest, I heard the grievances of an unhappy couple. The living don't know how to choose. It's too late to regret when they die. Man, I've avenged your death. Didn't you say you would be with me when I blow the whistle?
