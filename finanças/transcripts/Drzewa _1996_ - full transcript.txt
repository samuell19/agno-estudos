A Grzegorz Kr√≥likiewicz film TREES Screenplay Produced by Cinematography Music Directed by Starring Dad! Don't go there, dad! Gonna drown! You playing a hero, mister? I'm supposed to be a bad mother just because I like to read some poetry by the sea?! Right? Maybe you wanted to drown him, huh?! Don't tell mom. - Why? Just because. What are you writing down? You're teaching my kids and you're dumb as a box of rocks. You can see that I have to cut down this tree... To build a house for my children to live in. Stop writing that ticket, you dumbass! You know what you're writing it on? On paper, you idiot! Somebody had to cut down a tree so you could get paper for your tickets, you scum! You lowlife, I'll write you a ticket... You motherfucker! Come here, you...! Stop! Stop! Stop! One day... I'll write you a ticket, you scoundrel... You egghead bastard. You scum... Evie... We should live somewhere else. I can't stand this place. We should get away. Put this down, Paul. I thought it would make you happy. I am happy, Paulie... I'm happy. I want to show you something, look. Look at this, Paul. Paulie, look... We're the first ones to witness this... We're the first...look, Paulie. Doesn't seem like a big discovery to me. I entered them... Entered their secrets. What if they have a mind? Maybe they posses a will, and have ambitions? I don't know what else...intellect? Emotions? Memory... I feel naked... What are you afraid of, Paulie? Are you shy? Mom! The mailman brought this! When will you check my notebook, dad? I don't know how much space to leave... For grades and teacher's annotations. Yes, it's me. I just received it a moment ago. Yes, but... Something else has happened. No, mr professor... That's due in a month and a half. Something else happened...I... I'll write a book about it. It's just that I'm afraid... That it might require more than mere science... Who am I to say that science is morally neutral? There's a limit to science... And that limit is what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid, that... I don't want to start something big. To start something destructive. Mr professor, I too thought that I'll never die... But that notion disappeared after I reached my 30s. Yes, I will write about it in a letter. No, don't trouble yourself. No, I have company. Yes. Me too. Paulie, better is the enemy of the good. Petey, why don't you call for grandma... She might want to hear your mommy recite ancient proverbs. Petey... Darling please ask grandma if daddy can come down for dinner. - I will. - Go on now. Paul, my love, please take a shower. I'm not going to work for a criminal. Paulie... Your bones. Eat them before dinner. I know you like them. There's nothing to be angry about. What made you angry that one time? Granda, I have noticed something weird. A dead, brown leaf is raising from the ground... It turns yellow... Attaches itself to a branch... Turns green... It shrinks, turns into a bud and disappears. But how can that happen? Don't cry. Mom... The little tree is crying. Who's crying? Here, my darling. It fell and it's crying. Come, my darling. My darling son, why would it cry? - It fell from the balcony. - Petey is telling the truth. What's crying? Who's crying?! There will be crying! Someone will cry! You're raising him like you raised your daughter?! All against me?! Who am I to you people?! A loser? Compared to the dear educated daughter?! A butler? A butler... Dishing out tickets serving dear daughter's ideology, right? For the high and mighty academy?! Right?! I'm an honest... Honest teacher! And her! Should I say it?! You hypocrite... I will..I will... Pray some more, you harlot! You! Should I ask you... Petey... Step out for a moment... Should I ask about him? And about... So, do you know now? Do you? Who's crying? Any guesses?! My slipper... Hand me that. What? What! Don't cry. I'm sorry. An indian man... Loves... The gentle murmur of a breeze... That passes over a pond. He loves the smell... Of wind... Purified... - By the southern... - By the southern rain. Or... Of the wind... - Heavily filled by the fragrance of pine trees. Good. One more time. Son, catch! I ask you for purity... And innocence. Grant me protection... Against the temptations of the senses. Against the lust... And lewdness. Mom... Has professor ever proposed to you? It was unsettling. It happened a month after dad died in prison? Was professor already working on the academy? I know only what others said. - When did you find out?... - After I declined his advances. - That he drained father out of life? - I forgave him that. - Why haven't you warned me, mom? - It's better not to know. Than to live filled with hate. Constantly thinking about revenge. Don't cry. But I'm your daughter... It was not safe for me. You were safe. You loved Paul and he loved you back. Mom... I almost did it. When did you find out? I knew since I married Paul. And yet you became the professor's assistant. Please understand, I had so much to learn... I could finally become someone. And Paul? What did he say about it? He didn't know about it. That's what he claimed. It's a burden on him. But mommy, nothing happened. It did happen, but in your mind. Is that so important? Mom, why?... Why haven't you taught me about what's most important? I was scared. That they might be wrongly understood. No...no, mom. We all want to know. But we're scared to find out. My dear daughter... I don't think I was good. You gave in to him? Yes... Even after I knew about it all. It's all so frightening. Oh, Jesus! I swear to you that I truly love you. Trust me, like I trust you. You must know by now, that I love you. I won't hurt you, I'll watch you grow... As you become bigger...and bigger...and bigger... I will love you forever... I will love- Mom, a tree killed Mr Morawski. What do you mean "killed"? When he was cutting its roots. Trust me... Please... Trust me... Please, trust me... Please... I love you...I won't hurt you...trust me... You know I won't hurt you...I beg you... You know I love you... Please tell me little ones, what's this in my hand? What is it called? -Acorn! Good. Now tell me, what do you think... How much will this acorn weigh in 200 years? - 20 tons! - 5 tons! - 50 tons! 350 tons! How do you know that? You're correct, you can just look it up here, I wrote it down. Why will it weigh so much, what will happen to it? They killed my son! Killed! I'll cut it to pieces! I'll kill him! My little son... Dear son of mine... My dearest son... Why? You took from me... Son! My son... Son... Son of mine... Where is... My son... In that case let's conclude this meeting of the council. I wish that today's football match will be a good one. My money's on Barcelona. And what do you think? Right! I completely forgot! Propositions! My dear people, I almost forgot about this very important part. As the chairman of the Parental Committee, I propose... A notion to cut down all the rotten trees in our city! They're a constant danger! As the leader of the League of Nature... I support this notion! We all are a part of the whole of nature... But people's lives are at stake here! Time to vote! Who's in favor? I am! I am! Who's opposed? Good, very good then! Please include this in the protocol. Mom, I asked grandma already... - Yes? Why is he blinking so much? You see, Petey... It's likely that this plant... Is afraid. Of what? That I do not know. Maybe it's afraid of you? Why me? Maybe it thinks that you'll hurt it. Don't be silly... Everything I do is to help them. Mom, I'm scared. My dear... You don't need to be afraid of anything. After all... I'm here with you. I won't hurt you. Time's up! Petey, give it to me. Please, let me take it! You really surprised me... Only...wait just a moment... Let's do this...exactly... It's sticky! We'll fix that in just a moment... Just think about how very sentimental we are... In the way we, homo sapiens treat the tree species. We treat weeds as an example of the beauty of nature... And the banal form that preceeds fruiting, flowers... We compare to our lovely women. And so on, and so on. Meanwhile, if the temperature of our planet would rise by 20 degrees celsius... We would be ruled by plants. Now if you would add additional 2 degrees... Our existence would end... And plants would use us as compost. We don't think about these possibilities... And that's because the current temperature... Doesn't develop their other attribute... Their psychology, strong and expansive. We praise them too much... For their contribution to life on Earth. We don't need their oxygen. We have learned... That cosmic rays produce sufficient levels of ozone. Negative impact of plants... Can be proven on the example of tropical forests... That cause increasing rainfall. Causing destructive thunderstorms and floods... The plentiful growth around rivers... Is the cause of a huge amount of biological waste... Polluting oceans. Plants are parasites... In a comfy niche... Between us and minerals. Majority of these parasites would die off... Without the carbon dioxide... Which we provide and which they need for photosynthesis. Petey... Don't tell mommy... We'll find some balance in this, you'll see... Yes, yes... They mentioned you on TV. Professor...and his buddies. Yes? What did he say? You will always be jealous. - Of my work. - Of what?! Of everything. You're a small man, you understand? Small time career man. You're the career one! And...the way you do it... And what have you accomplished? Back in the day, a real man... Had to raise a son... Build a house... And plant a tree. And you? You only cut them down. You cut down healthy trees and pretend that they're rotten. And who's the one responsible?! Responsible for this?! All of this?! You! And your all knowing friend! I'm all ears. I recognize your breathing. Evie! I feel like Faust! All your experiments... Are documented, correct? Yes, that is correct. I can see it... Nobel prize! "You shall be gods!", right? We will be, you'll see! Their utopian ideas... Their whole ecology is nonsense. Eve, I can see it already! I can see it...psychology of plants... Emotions, ambtions, will...what else? Intuition? Our new chapter. Don't trouble yourself with more experiments. I'll take it off your hands. If I can have your documentation, I'll begin tomorrow. Mr professor... In the book that you call "ours"... Majority of it is my work, or used to be... You only wrote conclusions...which are opposed to what I think. You even changed the title. The photo on the back is the only thing we did together. "Our" book...Stepmother Earth... It's aimed against plants. And against life itself. Now now...don't be so dramatic, Evie. What about our conscience? Conscience... Is that meek little voice... Which whispers into your ear... That someone else... Is watching you. But there's no one here. No matter how much you'd spy on me... You won't find what you want. All the proof is locked inside my head. You think I'm a small-timer? I don't deal in anything small-time. The great... Fame... Is calling to us. Evie... These books... Are like our offspring. They can't be born without you. And you know it. You don't have any children. Why is that? Because I could see death all around. To control... Such fear... One needs... To have power. The power to kill someone else. To watch someone... Die... Teaches how to control... Your own fears. I beg of you, Evie... Don't believe what they say about my past. Even if I can't tell by looking at myself... What's good and what's evil about me... We'll find out... Together. By studying the pain... And happiness of plants. They will reveal the truth to us. The trees of knowledge... Of what's good and evil. I'll go now. Yes it's me mr Professor. No, there's no discovery. And there won't be! I feel just fine. It was a lie. I'm capable of lying... I'm capable of many things. Paul...I can't go on like this. Please tell me when did we go wrong? When you convinced me to hand out tickets... Why yes, you love your grades... I like to do that too. You should give me a ticket. For not being with you for so long. Why remind me about it? Do you know... What grade I would give you? - You know what subject I'm going to judge? - Yeah? - You know... - Paulie... - Oh really? While I was in a forest... A plumber almost... He was chopping a tree. I came back home... And I was so happy. To be alive and together. But you always complain about me. I don't...others... And they get it. Paul, I swear to you... On the life of this child... That I never cheated on you. You mean our child. Yes, don't lecture me. You know what else I wanted? For both of us... For you and me... To write a book together. With you? In that case I will... Tell you all about my book. A year ago I had a dream about coming back to you... To us. From a long trip. I pass a mailman in the doorway...and he's all sweaty. I know he's been with you. I can see how sweaty you are too. You follow him... With your gaze... And you don't even see me. First thing I do... Is to tie your hands... With an electrical cord. I attach the other end right under the ceiling, to a chandelier... You're hanging like that and moaning. I open all windows... And hit you with a belt. And just like I predicted... You stay quiet but you look out... Terrified... Because you care about your reputation. What will that do to your career? Afterwards I take you down... Untie you... And you're horny, you embrace me... Just like now... You unbutton me... And I push you out into the street. I exit and lock the door. I leave for a train platform. Throwing keys under a train. I know I'm the cruel one. What is that? What are you doing? Paul, leave me be! Stop it, Paul... - I was the one to convince you! I begged you for it! - Stop it! - Begged you so we can have this child. I did! You have to choose. Who do you live for?! - You don't live for anyone! Mom... How do you know who this is? Mom! I dreamed about dad. Gather around... We'll continue... With the speech given by... A chieftain of a Sioux tribe... Adressed to whites. In defense of the earth... Water...and trees. In white man's cities... There is no silence. No part of them... Would allow you to hear... The sound of a growing leaf in springtime... Sound... Of buzzing insects... City noise... Offends our ears. What good is life... If one cannot hear a song... Of a lonely nightjar... Or the croaking of frogs by a pond at night? An indian man... Loves... The gentle murmur of a breeze... That passes over a pond. He loves the smell... Of wind, purified by... The southern rain... Or of the wind... Heavily... Filled by the fragrance of pine trees. We cannot be vengeful! This is inhumane. Explain to me, why? Explain to me! It was an innocent child! Tell me, why?! Tell me! Tell me! Explain to me! Explain! Death for death! I knew all along it would die. - You're still alive! - What's with you people... They must be eradicated. You can't do it! You have no right! We're victorious! We cannot be defeated! Even with traitors among us! Don't listen to him! He's the killer! He's the one who said... That my son, Jacu≈õ would die! Don't waste rope on this traitor! Let the sea take him! Take him! Petey! Peter!... Petey! Where are you Petey... Petey?! Peter... Where are you... Mom...is this our home? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Paul?! - Dad! - Paul! Dad! Paul! You... Are? We are.
