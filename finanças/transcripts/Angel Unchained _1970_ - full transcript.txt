It's like fortune telling only it doesn't tell you the future, it tells you where it's at now. - Yeah? - You don't know? Why don't you ask it what we're all doing here? - One man can't ask a question about all people, you wanna know what I'm doing here, I can tell you that without this. - Yeah. - I, Jonathan Ravenel Tremaine, son of a wealthy Southern cotton family, rejected the julep, dabbled in revolution, and now find myself in the midst of this great agricultural waste, the leader of a group of humorless dropouts, leading them in another ripoff by eco-freaks, ecology. - Far out. - Well, I was doin' something bad somewhere at sometime. I don't know what it was, but it must've been pretty bad to trade for this. - I was just thinkin' it wasn't all that bad. - Interesting point of view. Back to the Yijing. - It may not make the Farmer's Almanac, but it would be nice if it made it through the winter. - Seems to look okay. - To me too, the trouble is there aren't any farmers around to say for sure. - Yeah, I keep forgetting you people aren't really farmers. - What about you? Well, what did you do? - I rode, I guess. - A club? - Yeah. - Did you like it? - I was okay when I was doing it. I mean, I, yeah, it was all right. What, what's happening? - Damn! - What's the matter? - Tremaine, Tremaine! Tremaine. They're coming, they're on their way! - Which way? - Over there. - Go and get your guys, get around that field over there. Don't let them get into the crops. You two take care of the animals. Merrilee, you take care of the babies. All right, let's move. And somebody get that gate closed. - You damn bastard! Next time we'll be back for your blood! One week, you're either gone, or we're running you into the dirt, get it? One week! - But this time we are really up against the wall. You saw what happened out there. You saw what they did to our place. They told us we got to be off of here by Saturday or we're dead. Yeah, they kill us or we starve because they do in our crops. - Hey, man. - Yeah? - I didn't come all the way out here just to get run off. - Well, have you got any ideas? - Yeah, he's gonna kill him. - Damn straight! - Listen, that's not even funny. I mean, even if we wanted to fight, which I do not, how, how are we gonna fight those guys? With what? - Right. - How are we gonna fight those guys? - Right, exactly. - And what about the children? - Yeah, what about the children? - I've got it, we'll send for sheriff, he... - And what's he gonna do? - Hell, they'll probably pay their gas to get out here. - I haven't heard one thing that sounded like it was gonna do any good at all. So I'm gonna do the only thing there's left to do, I'm gonna lay in the lap of the man that's responsible for it. - Yeah. - Angel, what about your bike club? - What about 'em? - Well do you think they might like to come here and help us out in this situation? - You got to be kiddin'. - No, I am not kidding, I am desperate, man. It's life or death. - Tremaine, you have a very short memory. You remember what happened out there today? That was nothin'. You bring a bike club in here, you're gonna have a lot of trouble on your hands. - Anymore problems than I have right now? - Man, it's like asking some degenerate to babysit your kid. - If the degenerate can keep the kid alive then I'm ready! - You're not even listening to me. What do you think you these guys are, a bunch of kids? They play a little rough, no. Hey, people, I, you know, I'm sorry I messed up your little farm, but, I'm sorry. - Merrilee, you're the reason he's here, you know. It's up to you. - There ought to be another way. - There isn't. - He likes you, you know? Really, and he knows why you did what you did with no blame, so don't blame him for trying to keep this place together. He's unofficial glue. - Glue? What he send you out to convince me or something? - Yes. - Well, that's a bad idea. - It's the only idea we have. - Damn. - What? - I don't see why you didn't turn me onto the peace trip before I did that number on that guy, you know? - It wouldn't have helped, Angel. It takes a long, long time before you calm down all the way. - Yeah, well, that's something I don't know if I can handle. - Do you wanna try? - Wanna turn me onto it? - Yes. - That's probably tension, man. - Well, how 'bout a refill. - Okay. - Yeah, where's Angel? - He took off this morning on his bike. He had some stuff to figure out in his head. - Yeah, it must've been a lot of stuff, if he's not back by now. - It's a whole new way of thinking for him. - Where'd he go? - I didn't ask. - You ticked at me or something? - No, I'm just worried, I guess. - I wouldn't worry about Angel. One thing he does do well is take care of himself. Ray, take the horn, go up there on the hill, and keep a lookout. I know they said a week, but I don't trust 'em. I'll send somebody up to spare you in a little while. - All right. - And I wouldn't worry about Angel, we're the ones that are in trouble. - Yah, yah, yiyah! Yah, yah, yah, hup to! Yah, yah, yah. - Mornin', I was just over at the gas station, they said that I could find you over here. Yeah, well, what happened yesterday with the pitchfork? It was an accident, you know? Well, what else is happening? - What do you want? - Hey, I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry I did that. But that was me, not those people. I want you to just let them be, simple enough? Just let them do their thing, man. - Do their thing, what the hell's that's supposed to mean, boy? Do their thing? I don't even care, I don't give a damn. You have until Saturday, man, dig? - Dig, hey, what do you want man? Those people aren't hurting you out there. What's your big hassle? What do you wanna put 'em away for? - Dave, I didn't know we were gonna bulldog no pigs here today. I think we oughta clear this place out. We don't need to be smelling no pigs.

Hello, Caveman, LJ. Hi. Hey, Dennis, Red. How you doin', Rush? Afternoon, Pilot. Shotgun, Magician. Nice place. - Yeah, nice score. - Yeah, well, I was just out riding around, and thought I'd stop by, see how you people are getting along without me. I got a favor. Need a favor, man. Yeah, well, it's kinda thirsty on the road, can I buy you people a drink? - Yeah, hey. - Well, I guess I'll come right out front with it and say it. I've been sort of living on this commune like farm. In a way, it's a, it's really a nice place. - Then why ain't you there, man? - I thought you might wanna see it. Would you dig a run? - Someone has floundered your mind, ex-brother. Or you've been away too long, man. A farm is not like a run. Hey, but I shall remove this evil spell. So you can get your head straight. Now, let's see what kind of potion is needed for such a serious case. I've got uppers, downers, red devils, green devils, of course I've got some blue angels, a little bad fish maybe, a little red dirt hash, good Lebanese grass, what is it? Just remember, man, speed kills. And what don't? - What's the problem? - These cowboy citizens, they don't read keep off the grass signs. These people at the commune, Pilot, they're really good people. They don't know what to do. I thought maybe you and some of the boys might show 'em how. - How many do you need? - As many will come, I guess. - How long? - Five, six days. - Cowboys? - Wow, man, cowboys? And you need help. - Farmer, man, you got to be kidding me, really. - Yeah, well, I see, all the same boys aren't here. I can't be the only dropout. - Farmer, what, you milk cows, man? - Shit, man. Pilot, this is my lady, Merrilee, Tremaine. Pilot will be our house guest for the next couple of days. - Where's the beer? - Make yourself at home. - Look at all them chickens around here. - We will. - Let's get it on, man. - Well, so far so good. - Yeah, not very far. What do you think, lnjun? - They look kinda dirty. - Yeah, you're gonna need quite a sense of humor for the next couple days. - Hello. - Hello. - Dig my past? - Not a lot. - Wasn't that long ago. Jackie. - This her? - Baby, I don't need this. That was then, now is now, okay? - I'm sorry, anyway, I didn't mean to interrupt anything. I just wanted to show you something I thought you'd be interested in seeing. What's left of our tattoo, you remember? Shotgun didn't like it, so one night he just decided to cut it out. - I'm sorry, baby. I just had to move. - Okay. - Hey, you wanna swap, man. - No. - If you do, say so. - I don't. - Otherwise, you stay away. - Okay, man. - That goes for you too, momma. - Now that's heavy. - Yeah, I can get behind that. ♪ If your household catches fire, warm your hands ♪ ♪ If your household catches fire, warm your hands ♪ ♪ You will only be as free ♪ ♪ As you let other people be ♪ ♪ If your household catches fire, warm your hands ♪ - Wow, man, what's this junk, man? - It's garbage, man.

Yeah, what's in 'em? - Some Indian recipe, I guess. - I mean, is it hash or something else? - Told you, I don't know. You'll have to ask the Indian, he'll probably lay some on ya. - Yeah but we ain't gonna be here forever, man. I mean, how do you make it at home, you know? - Pilot, I don't know, ask the Indian. - You holding out on me? - Come on, man. - Yeah, all right, I'll ask the Indian. - Morning, how'd you sleep last night? - All right. - That's good, I got a favor to ask of you. Some of the people got to go into town, they're gonna need a chaperone. And take the pickup truck, get a couple of cases of beer. - You thirsty? - Thirsty, yeah. All right, okay. - We have a little problem, Tremaine. - Yeah? - They got into the Indian stash. They want some more. - I'm sure he'll lay it on 'em. - Yeah, but if they get into it too heavy, they're gonna mess up the place. Pilot wants the recipe. - Yeah, well, you know, for what you get, you have to pay. - Very true, my friend. - Good morning. - Afternoon. - Beautiful day. - Has been so far, yep. - Hey, hippie, you get tired of eating sheep dip for dinner? Looks like our neighbors have found some of their own kind to play with. Boy, that ain't easy when you smell like they do. Well, now, look at that, they don't mind walking a few steps out of their way. You know, I like that. - Gets kinda hot out here, doesn't it. - It's been known to. - Humidity's nice. - Hey, now, what you got there, boy? - Hey, man, why don't you let him through. - Am I in your way, boy? - Local boys are kinda playful. - Well, not much happens here. Gotta make your own fun, you know? They're okay. - It's heavy, man, let him through. - No, that ain't no way to talk. Yeah, you just go on by, boy. I don't wanna be in your way. - Just no regards for property rights anymore. - Not too much, things got kinda outta hand. Well, the important thing is too much, property rights or anything else. People got to know when to stop, you know. - Right. - Especially when it's so hot. Too much activity is not good for you. - I know what you mean. Watching so much activity, a person could really get pooped. - Well, I think it's getting a little too noisy, too much activity. Guess I better put a stop to it? - Well, it was certainly nice chit chatting with you. - By the way, don't worry about the two bits for the bullets, the county will take care of it. Nice talkin' to you, too, bye. - Toodle-loo. - Okay, now, me and Burr are here to teach you guys how to fight a little bit, you dig it? You guys got one thing in your favor, they don't expect you're gonna fight 'em. So what you do is you catch 'em, you catch 'em off guard then you catch 'em by surprise. You dig it? You dig it? - Man, what'd you do that. - What's the matter? Just adding a little realism to it. What do you do if I grab ya? Just not funny man, there's nothing to laugh about. What if I snatch you up and I'm gonna... You guys don't need to learn how to fight, man, you need to learn how to run. Let's go get a beer, man, forget it. - Come on, dammit, I told you to get it deeper than that. A little bit more over here too. - Now look, anywhere you hit him it's gonna hurt, but aim for the head if you can. Body movement is very important, I'll help you with that. Use your shoulders, use your shoulders. Like that, like that. A little low, but it's okay. Come here, let me help. Give me your hand, put it in your hand. - How 'bout this? - Turn around. Shoulders move, straining forward, straining forward. Over the shoulder, right. Ready, ready? Go! That's it, a little more kinda hip thing. - It's a joke. It's a bad joke, man. I mean these people can't fight. Really, they don't even want to. They're losers. What are you doing here? What are you doing here, man? Really, planting corn and plows and potatoes, beets? What is all that stuff? You gave up motorcycles for parsley, really? It's the broad? - The broad's okay. - It ain't the broad? - Come on, the broad's cool. - Stayin' here for a broad. - Yeah. - I'll tell ya something, if the rest of the club decides to split, then you know, I split. Why don't you come back? I promise you come back, we'll plant some corn. - Plant some corn. - It's a promise, I swear. - I don't know. - Yeah, I don't know, then stay with your chickens. Stay with your chickens! - Private crisis or may I join? - Sure. - The girl with the tattoo? - Yeah, what about her? - How'd it happen? - She used to be my old lady. I left the club, I guess, nobody wanted to sleep with her so she went with Shotgun. He got bugged with the tattoo. - But why'd she have it in the first place? - I don't know, one after trip it was there. You know, she didn't even know. The thing I ask myself is, well, what was I doing there, you know? I mean, you just wake up one morning and... - I don't believe that. - You are lucky, baby. You're very lucky. Hey, Shotgun. Past your bedtime. - Yeah, if only I had a good reason to go to bed. Like princess, how much you want for her? - Hey, man, I don't deal anymore. - Yeah, maybe the reason you don't is because she ain't yours to sell? - Hey, babe, why don't you find something else to play with before you go to bed. - Man, I'm just tryin' to stir up a little action. I mean, don't you read the magazines? I thought you hippies were supposed to believe in free love. - So you're here. I was wondering where you were. Things were kinda quiet back at the house. - Yeah, things are kinda quiet all over, that's what we're talkin' about. Tryin' to strike up a little action here. - We are through talking, Shotgun. - No, I ain't made my deal yet, remember? - Well, couldn't it wait fill in the morning? - Baby? - You businessmen may continue to discuss me all night long if you'd like to, I'm bored. - She looks good, man. But she talks too much. - Okay, okay, I know, be cool. You were the one that told me to bring those animals out here and I did. Now they mess with me and my chick, I'm gonna do 'em in. As far as the commune's concerned, tough. I'm sorry, Tremaine. - Got to let it pass. Stay away from 'em. If you're cool, they'll be cool. I've got to keep them here. - Yeah. - Wow. - You wanna drink? - Yeah. Wow, man. - It's pretty? - Yeah. - What is that? - What do you mean, what is that? Hey, hey. Hey, hey, baby, baby. Hey. Yeah? Wow, man, wow. This place is a bummer, man. Well, I can't take this much more. First that jazz in town, now Angel's pushing. - Yeah, well... - I ain't diggin' it, man, I wanna split. I mean, how long we supposed to hang around these clowns anyway? - Yeah, well, it's a drag, man, but it is for Pilot. - Man. - How you doing? - You oughta see Angel, man. - Well, working on vegetables, look like it got him weak. - Yeah, man. - He wants to split, man. - All right, let's go put it to Pilot. - I'm with you, but, you know, it seems a shame to leave without, without taking a little memento of our visit, right? Well, I mean that lndian's stash. - Wow, man, yeah. - That lndian's stash. They owe it to us, right, after all that stuff we showed. - All right, what do you guys think about that? Let's do it, let's go talk to him, man. There. - What's the matter, don't you like playing bruised hero? - Well, you're not exactly my idea of the fair maiden. I've been through a lot since I've been here, you know? You're asking too much, I mean, it's hard, baby. I mean, even if I wanna, you know, it's hard. So you can take care of yourself, really? I don't believe that. You don't know those people. Maybe I don't know you. All right, I made a mistake with the pitchfork, and with that punk kid. Made a lot bigger mistake bringing Pilot and those people out here. I mean, as far as the commune is concerned, I don't even think that's gonna make it. Maybe it will. Me, you know, I'm tryin' to get away from that stuff. I mean, just breathe. I'm a pretty heavy target. - What do you want, man? - Split. - Well, just get the hell outta here. - We want the stash. - We'll give 'em the stuff, didn't have to wreck the place, now tell 'em to stop. - Is that a question? - Pilot, just tell 'em to stop. - Hey! - What are you doing? - Where's your stuff? - What stuff? - Hey, man, you better tell your friend that we want the stuff. We mean business, we want the stuff, and we wanna split. - You talkin' about the stuff the Indian makes? Aw, man, that's some kind of secret ingredient it's a whammo, it takes him forever. - What's this forever jazz, man? We saw him do it in 10 minutes! - You're talking about chocolate chip cookies. He puts it in chocolate chip cookies. He's a freak for chocolate chips! - Wow, doodah doodah. - Hey, Tremaine! - Hood, what happened, man? - They're coming tomorrow. - Now look, man, we're leaving tomorrow morning early. Now there better be some whammo ready. I don't care if that lndian's got to work all night. Now if there's not, you're not gonna have to worry about the towners. There ain't gonna be enough of this place for them to bother with. Now, get it on. - What's he talkin' about? What kind of deal did you make? I thought they were gonna stay. - Now whatever deal you heard about you can forget. 'Cause like I said, we're splittin'. Now you take Tonto there and get it on. - I still owe you a favor, but I'm going with the club. - What are we gonna do now, Angel? - We give 'em what they want. We take on the townies the best we can, that's all. - I wanna keep 'em here. I need 'em. - Now way, man. - Can I help? - No, this one's gotten out of hand. - You think that's your fault? - That's not important. I'm tryin' to figure out a way for us to survive. - You think that's possible? - I don't know. - Is it worth it? - I don't know. - Tremaine, are you quitting? - Well, maybe I should. You know, we came out here to get away from the city, and now we're getting jacked up against the wall just like back in the city. I don't know what's wrong. I wouldn't know what to do if I did know what was wrong. Could ask you what a good pacifist would do, but I don't care. I don't know how you do it, lnjun. You been workin' all night. You had anything to eat? - When I work, I work, then I eat. - Yeah, well, you Yaquis into that bag. You got anything in your bag to cover this? - What? - Well, keep the bikers here, keep the townies away. - Sure, let the biker go. Give them the powder. And welcome the people in town. - Yeah. - Or burn up the powder. Or pretend you burn up the powder up. Or burn up the motorcycles. Or hide the powder, then the motorcycle will stay. Or maybe keep the cars away. - Yeah, and as long as I got the whammo, they got to wait till I get back. - Sure. - You don't say anything to anybody, especially to Angel, 'cause he's not gonna like this. You tell 'em I got the whammo. You don't know anything else. - True, true. - Okay, man, explain it. - I'm just trying to keep the commune together. - Like how, for instance? - Like keeping your bike club here for protection. - Yeah, well, they are splitting. - Not without this stuff they're not. - Tremaine, didn't you see what they did without even asking for the stuff? I mean, they're gonna break things. And if they figure they've been burned, they're just not gonna break things, they're gonna break everybody's head. - Well, they're welcome to the stuff after they've done what they're here for. - Well, I'm not gonna argue with you anymore, man. They could be hurting our people right now. - You don't know the way these people move, Tremaine. Maybe know know why I didn't wanna bring them out here. - Buggies? - Right. - Okay, all right, let's get 'em in the wash before they get in here. Red, you lead this people in whatever you showed 'em how to do, all right? - Right. - Shotgun, grab that scrambler over there, all right? - Right. - Hey, no guns. I got this one. - No guns? - No guns. I got this scrambler. Magician, you guard that Indian shack over there with the stash.
