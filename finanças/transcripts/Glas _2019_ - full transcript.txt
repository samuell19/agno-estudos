THE VOICE Goran. Goran! What? Please check where we need to turn. We are a little late. I don't know if we should let them know. Another half a kilometer straight ahead and then turn. Come on already! You just go straight here. Yeah. What do you think? It's okay. Let's go. Hello. I'm Paola Butorac. I brought my son. I'm sorry I'm a little late. I've got these... That's upstairs to the left, then down the hall. Here, I prepared everything. You just fill in the contact information and sign. Here you go. Does he have to sign, too? Yes, yes. You and him. Come on, Goran. Sign. What is it? Nothing, sign it. These are the house rules. Any other contacts you can leave? Well, there's a father, but we are not in touch with him. Okay, okay, it's just paperwork. For his file. Not in touch... Here's the payment receipt for this month. The rest can be paid in March? Yes. However's easier for you. These are the internet passwords. It can be used every day in the room next door. Just in that room? Right now it's not available everywhere, we're still under construction. But you just come here and... Of course, you just moved. It's been going on for a month. They're even putting solar panels on the roof. This is your ID, it's the proof you are our resident. Do carry it on you at all times. Make sure you don't lose it. It also gives you a discount in two bakeries on the boardwalk. There we have a sports hall... Sorry, dear. The study rooms are down there. Here's one as well. And this is the gym, but it's not completely ready yet. Well done. Excellent. I'm really impressed. That's standard now. Sports, studying, companionship. Nothing like it was before. Wait. This will be our chapel. Very modern. That was sent from Germany by a gentleman called Mirko Bućan. You've set everything up really nice. We got something from the church, something from the diocese and... Excellent. -Yes, it is. I am floored, really. They spelled my name wrong. It happens. I'll call you from work, when I board the ship. Be good. You know everything, I don't have to tell you. You can be satisfied, really. What now? I told you what this is. Look, Goran. Here you have everything you need. It will also sort you out a little bit. Come on! Take care. I'll be calling you and don't talk back to everyone. Come here. Take care. Goran. Come, let me show your room. I am Goran. Frane. You two are in the same room. Darko, there have to be two kinds of salad. Okay, I'll bring some. No need to panic. Fuck, I forgot the salad. Take mine, I won't eat it. Okay, as you like. I'm Goran, by the way. Right. Stipe. Stipe! You can't eat before others. What? You know how it is, don't play stupid. Five modems will be enough. Okay. Bye! The new printer is on your desk. I checked it, now it works. I'm sorry for the previous one. Okay, okay. Thank you dear, you're great. Hello! I am Dan... I am Danijela. Welcome. Thanks. Settled in? -Yes. I'm so glad to have you with us. I've heard you're good at math. You went to competitions? Well, yes. Get to know the guys. I'm here if you need anything. Okay. We got a new boy today. Goran... Stand up, so they can see you. Come on, introduce yourself. I am Goran. And? And... I went to math competitions. And? I trained judo. Don't be afraid, I wasn't very good. That's right. The more of us, children, the merrier! Tibor, drop that, please . Come on. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Call the man. Call, call the man. What man? I don't know, just call him. Quiet. We're not in a bar. What are you showing her? It's nothing, some pictures. Let me see. It's really nothing. Just stuff. If it's just stuff, let me see it. Please, don't. Would you like your parents to see that? Well, no. Then let me see. I won't show it to anyone. Just delete that, okay? It's great here. Better than home. Anyone have a charger for Samsung Galaxy? Hey, knock it off, you'll break it. A friend of mine from Split has one. I can ask, maybe he doesn't need it. Okay, do that. I had a coke somewhere around here. So fuckin' what, no one took it. Well, where is it then? What, fags? Why don't you answer me? Where's my coke? Wait, you're from Split? Yes, why? Just asking. I didn't think you were. Why? You know, you don't pray. Well, I don't. So, where are you from? From here. Are you a Muslim? The fuck, come on! Leave the man alone, who cares? I'm just asking. Leave me alone. I'm not, no. How can I get to the city? There's a bus, but you have to be back by 10. And what for, I mean, why? Why what? Well, are you a Catholic, like us, or... I dunno, I guess... I don't know. Okay then... Hey, anyone interested in online group play? Goran, right? Sit down there. Fill up those gaps. Get a move on. All here? Yes. I would like you all to attend these meetings. At least once a week to meet with the counsellors and discuss what's going on. By the way, you will have fast internet before the class. Did I keep my promise? Yes. And did you? What have you been doing? You said yourselves that you want to do the play. Right, Klara? Again with the phone? I'm not. All right. Andrea will begin working on the exhibition and we can start rehearsing the play. I would really like it if you all took part. Yes, Klara? I can be Mary. I used to act in elementary school. Well, you can't. Why? Because of your behaviour. Yes, Mirela? I think that Mary can be a little bit crazy. I wouldn't say so. Okay, who wants to play Mary? Sonja, put your hand down. It's for the kids. Oh, no, no. I was just trying to get them going... Okay. Bruna! You'll be Mary. Okay. Does anyone else want to? Do it, why not? You have the heart for it. Let's see, who wants to play Joseph? I'll do it. You? Just a sec. Yes? Please, don't tell me you can't find two big poles for the cross. One longer and the other shorter. Is that so hard to figure out? Jesus, Stipe, move that away. But this is Frane's mom. Fuck off! Frane, is this your mother? Stipe, settle down. Settle down, seriously. Or we'll call your parents. Wait, stop, stop. Okay. Right foot. Right, yes. So, you mean left? Are you coming today? Sure I am. Do you even have the script? Where do I get that? Ask the counsellor. Oh, right. Don't screw it up. We can't do it without Joseph. I won't. I think it's great. Well, I don't really believe you. Ivana, did you bring the medical card? You can't go on the trip without it. What's up, mullah? Give me a slice of bread. Why mullah? Like the guy that prays in a mosque. Oh, right. I think I know what's a mullah. What about the part you're playing? Joseph? He's the most important, man. Isn't Jesus the most important? Oh, well, I mean... Hey, hi! What's up? Nothing. I came to see if everything's fine. Do the lights work at last? Sonja, do we have lights? Give us some light. It's coming. I tried them, it's all good. Okay. Let me know about it. We work together. I know, but I have a million things to do. Sorry. Quiet! Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Hold it. Move it more to the middle. Where's that extension? Stop it, you'll take someone's eye out. I didn't find a costume for you. Take the stick for now and we'll figure it out. Okay? Move that more to the middle. That's no good. This needs to be put there. To hook this... What are you doing? Reading. Who got you pregnant? Excuse me? I'm being stupid. You asked who got me pregnant. Well, I wanted to know. And you, like, don't know? I'm just talking nonsense. I'm Mary. It's obvious who got me pregnant. How about you stop being rude? You're asking dumb questions. Let's rehearse now. We're almost done. If my first scene is with Gabriel, then I'm not pregnant yet. He announces the conception. Okay, I'll take that until you get pregnant. That's the scene with Jospeh. It's with you, you hear me? When's our turn? Before the birth. Fuck you, moron! I'll take those swords away, seriously. I hear a voice. Where are you? Who are you? I am angel Gabriel and I bring good tidings. You've found the mercy of God. You'll give birth to a son and he'll be great. He will reign over the kingdom of his father and the kingdom will never end. How will this be, when I have not known my husband? Holy Spirit will come upon you and you will hear a voice. Thank you, servant of God, may it be as you said. Joseph, my husband. I have happy news. I'm pregnant. How's that possible? We've never been together? Angel Gabriel told me that I shall become pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Everything is possible in God. Read your lines, Goran. Come on, Goran. It doesn't make sense. What? She says she is pregnant, but not with me. That's how it happened. Read it, you're annoying us. I can't. Why not, Goran? I just can't. What exactly you don't get here? The fact that this is impossible. It is possible. In God, of course. Goran, this is common knowledge. -Well, it's stupid. He's insulting. That's the problem here. Straight to the headmistress. -Why? Tell her that it's stupid. -Come down. Come on. Come on down. What should I do with the stick? -Give it here! Can I be Joseph if he won't? Just leave me alone, Frane, please. Let's go on without Joseph. What happened? He has to see the headmistress. Yeah? Why? There's been an issue, so to say. So, he'd have to see her. What issue? I suppose I should tell her. Is that so? Wait there. Close the door. -Sorry? I said close the door. Don't whine, please. I know you've got money. This trip will cost me like a stay in a five-star hotel. I told you, the scouts are six stars. We arranged everything, you just finish it. Yes, of course! It's our pleasure. I knew you'd come. Come in. Just close the door, please. Sit down. Let's hear it. Well... What's the matter? Kitty got your tongue, as we say here? What are these incidents? -I don't know. What incidents? Is something wrong? The room, the food? -No, everything is okay. So, why are you like that? Did you fight with someone? Did we insult you in any way? Okay. If you don't want to say it... Sonja, honey, please tell me what happened with the kid? No, no, tell it like it is. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Sit down, where do you think you're going? Why did you say Joseph is stupid? No, I said I felt stupid to read that. Well, aren't you a character. Look, Goran. You can do or think whatever you want. But you cannot tell believers that their faith is stupid. Especially when you know nothing about that. I know how you feel. Your mother is far away, working. You got here, you don't know anybody. Your world came tumbling down. But that doesn't mean you have to be angry with everyone. So, next time be careful what you mock. I wasn't mocking. -Okay, you weren't mocking... But try to change your attitude. I'm saying this as a friend. Okay? Okay. Okay? -Okay. I'll consider that we have settled this. Please, just apologize to Sonja and the girls, okay? If we understood each other, take off. Hey! What are you doing? Come on, get down. Come on, Stipe! Don't go easy on him, Stipe. He doesn't have to go easy on me. Fair play is key. I don't want anyone to go easy on me. Can I play now? I can't play anymore, but we'll have another tournament. Whose turn is it? Mine. -Come on, I said it first. You two. The winner will play against Stipe. What about us, girls? When the boys are done. Hey, Goran. Come here. This is our reverend. This is Goran, our new boy I told you about. Goran. Duje, nice to meet you. Sorry, my hands are a bit sweaty. It might be good if you got to know each other and have a little talk. Just a second. Let me catch my breath. Fucking hell! Luka! In front of the reverend? I'm sorry reverend. It hit the edge. When the reverend's not here, then it's fine? What did you say? You don't need to apologize to me. But to the one who hears! Come on, moron, just play. You don't understand that. Serve! Van? It couldn't fit in a van, my friend. I also got to take the kids to communion. Okay. Thanks. What's the problem? I don't know. Do you have a problem? Can't fit in or something? -No, not really. Why don't you pray then? Because. -Because! There's always a reason. Are you mad at someone? -No. No. I don't know... There's no God. There's no God... How can that be? Who made us? It's like not having a father! -Well, I don't. I never hear from him. Well, you can hear from God, if you want to hear. I'm not so sure. Here. I hear him, even now. I get it. Just listen. Hey, Duje. Was this left for you? It was. Thank you very much. Don't you worry about a thing. Even if you won't go to him, he will find his way to you. Hey, it's me. How's it going? Got a sec? No, everything is fine. I don't want to bother you. I just wanted to ask you... Can I come there? No, it's not that bad. It's just... I can't explain it. When your ship docks somewhere. I'm not screwing with you. All right. I'll be patient. Bye. Hey! Want one? Let me see. Where did you get this? Go ahead, I actually took that one for you. Okay. Thanks. Everything's explained in simple terms. Come on! Move away, you fag. Didn't you say you'll suck my dick if you lose? Is that right? I'm not sucking your dirty dick, stupid fag. This one's for the office. -Okay. Goran! Just a sec. I heard the talk went well! Good job! I'm so pleased! With our reverend. That you wanted to talk and that he got a real good vibe from you. A real good vibe! Thank you. Just relax. Everything will fall into place. Like always. Thank you, darling. I don't want any... -Do we pray every day? I'm hungry as fuck. Sit down already. -Quiet, I can't hear myself think. Don't touch my food. What's the matter? Good morning! I'll just have a coffee. We are hungry! Okay, settle down! Hah, hungry... I'd like to share something with you. I know you're hungry. I'll be brief. It's important. Klara! Will you come and read something? Why me? You've got a good reading voice. Come on. Loudly, so everyone can hear you. This bit, I marked it. The participants of "Walk for Life", in green, pink, blue and white T-shirts, with balloons, walked singing to Ante Starčević street, but they were stopped by a group of 15 aggressive girls, with a banner reading: "My body, my choice". They blocked the way to the rally against abortion and the police had to intervene to prevent an open conflict. Can you imagine that? They blocked the way to mothers, who don't want to kill unborn babies. By that logic, none of us would have been born. We would have all been aborted. Sonja, honey. Come. I'd like you to take a photo of our prayer. We'll send it to these brave women, to show that we are with them. Come on, get ready and we can start. Is that okay, Sonja? Okay. Our thoughts are with them now. Goran. Is it stupid, again? Why don't you want to join in? Come the fuck on, man! Fine. No food until we have all prayed. For everyone? For everyone. And that's no way to speak to me. Hey, I'm really sorry guys, but this is not fair. Do you believe? I do, so what? Well, then be on our side. That's not the point. Hey, did you hear the lady? Don't act like a bunch of hooligans. Settle down. Can I ask something? Why can't we eat? He's the one not praying? To show him our faith and strength. Quiet! Come on, all together! Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. No one shall touch the food, until Goran prays. Goran. Goran! You think that women who kill unborn children are right? I don't know. You don't know? Fine. Well, fuck it. Life's not fair. It's not fucking fair... Stop acting like hooligans, please! Hey, hey! -What's the matter with you?! We're hungry. What's wrong with them? Well, children. They're hungry. Those who don't settle down will be grounded. You are free to go! They're so rude, selfish, no sense of community. You are free to go, Goran. I didn't mean to... -Go! We just docked. How are you? Great. Suck my dick, you hear me? Take that into the hall, it's open. I'll get it. Thanks. I'll take that. It's fine. Let go and step away. It's fine, let go. You know what? Fuck off. Hey, it's okay. Fine, have it your way. Hey, I'm sorry. What for? You didn't get to eat because of me. Get a grip, man. What are you apologizing for? Oh, that's some joke. Give me some more. Come here. What's wrong? Are you afraid? No. I want to go to sleep. What do you want to know from him? I want to know what happened. Give it a rest, man. Why wouldn't he drink? I don't drink, really. Why are you doing this? What are you getting from it? Leave him alone, he's not doing it to hurt us. How do you know? If it's nothing, why doesn't he speak out? Well, you know... -Know what? No fuckin' peace at all. What's the point of this? Cut the crap, Frane. Turn it up. I gather lunatics around me, others are just freaks anyway Our life is a game of rock, paper and scissors The city is a zoo, people are animals Fellas are like bulls, the games begin We try to raise money to call the man If you ain't got money, call him anyway... Call the man, call, call the man What man? I don't know, just call him Get your phone and call him now Hey, don't fucking throw up here. Where the fuck are you? Why don't you come down? I fell asleep. Did you read the book I gave you? I will, later. Read it already! The A/C still needs to be put up. It will be done in a couple of days. Fuck! There's a computer for every kid here. Look, Tina. Tina! Okay. Take this up to your room and we'll go for a pizza. What should I do? Wait here, I guess. Let's just take it easy, okay? You tell us what happened. It wasn't that bad, right? -It was nothing. They blew it out of proportion. Out of proportion! They wanna throw you out. Take it easy. You told the priest there's no God? It wasn't like that! -No? You're making up problems, like you're in jail? I see these people are normal. It depends. Oh, does it? It looks to me that you're the one causing trouble. All right. Is it true you insulted Virgin Mary? No. That's really not true. What the hell is it then? Showing off in front of the girls? -Like your uncle. No. Okay. Okay, it's a fucked up situation. I'll give you that. It's a new environment, you're alone. It's confusing, but if everybody's a believer, why can't you be one too? What's God's fault in it? Well, he doesn't exist. Thank you! -I asked for mayo. Have you seen the accommodation? Cut them some slack. You think I believe in the... Fucking doves and that shit. Leave him alone. Wait, you do believe... Of course he does! But he should learn how life is. There aren't many second chances. Stop saying bullshit. Okay, I'll try. We got a deal, then? Try for your own sake, not ours. Eat up. Hey lad! What are you staring at? Get inside. What's the problem? Little idiot. Have you all taken your food? Okay. Let's pray and then we'll eat. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. You're not having anything? Why aren't you fucking eating? Let him be. We don't need all that again. I want to help him. -Sure, you're gonna help him. Leave me alone. -It's always something with you. Diana, just meat, no potatoes. And a salad. Anything deep fried? -No, just what I said, I'm starving. What is it? You're not hungry? We're all telling him. You have to eat something. You don't think we'll let you starve? Well, if I don't believe, then I'm not allowed. What? -Well, to eat. The church gave us that. -Excellent logic. Okay, well, you see... The church also donated that chair you're sitting on. Are you sitting? Let me ask you this: Are you breathing? Everything here, even the air you breathe is the air we share with our church. It's everywhere with us. And now what? So, think again if it's worth doing what you're doing. How long can you go like that? I'm sick of all this, honestly. That's how I ended up in the middle of the sea. Okay, fun time's over. We don't want to insult the reverend. I'm not insulted. Just don't do it anymore. Fine. People, I have a question for you. Who here thinks they're a believer? A real one? What? No takers? No, I'm serious. Speak up. Who among you truly believes? I think I do! Going to church doesn't make you a believer. It's not that simple. Faith has to be lived, my friends. It's not enough to just observe. It's not like watching a football match. We need to be the players, strikers and playmakers. Look at yourselves. Do you have it in you? You! No, no. The yellow one, yes. Look into yourself and then you'll find that something. You'll find faith and then you'll be a true believer. Fine, thank you. Hey! Hey! What did you come for? I'm listening. -Leave him be. You've been skulking round here a lot. Why don't you get me some doughnuts, now you're here. He's so fake. Thanks. Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I wasn't planning to speak tonight, but this... But this guy's been nagging me to say a few words, so I said I would. I want to tell you to believe. You really have to believe. I didn't and some things happened to me. So I started believing afterwards. But I want you to open up sooner. I want you to believe sooner. And I wish that you go to Betinac. You'll have a great time there. She's wonderful! Such a great girl! I have no doubt that He will find His way to you. If you are open enough. Love each other. God is always there with you. Enjoy! Don't. Come on, Stipe, don't. Hey, Stipe! He's insulting! Hello? Anybody there? Wait, you did this? It was an accident. Come on, get in. Get in! Wait, you're coming with me. What's that on your arm? Nothing. Don't speak back to the headmistress. For your own good. Stand in the middle, Goran. Where? -There You know what you did? Yes. -Yes what? Will you please try to explain why? I don't know. It upset me. Fuck it. -Quiet! Goran, please. What upset you? I can't tell. What are you laughing at? How can he be so stubborn, man? -Let it go. Now, apologize to everyone and we will forgive you. I'm sorry. -No, no, no. I want a genuine apology. We did everything to welcome you. I forgave all your arrogance, but this I won't. How do you want me to apologize? So that you understand... That you've harmed something we hold very dear. And that you did it with no scruple at all. Is that right, Bruna? Well, I mean... -It's a statue! So what? Apologize and that's it. I'm gonna go crazy here, I swear. Stop showing off! -I told you not to mention... Let the guy speak, for fuck's sake! This will never end. What? -You broke a religious symbol! What are you laughing at? Darko! You did not throw a rock at a statue, Goran. You threw it at all us believers! I wasn't born yesterday. That's enough! Come on, apologize! Goran, you are a good boy. We are waiting. -Come on already! Come on! Do it. Be a man! Take a deep breath. Exhale. Okay. Do you have any problems? Any complaints? -No. Does anyone in your family have mental issues? No. Do you have any behavioral problems? I don't think so. All right. I've found nothing. No indicators of epilepsy, but I will send you for some neurological tests, just in case. You're free to go. What did he say? -I've got to do neurological tests. Yeah, right. They always send you for those tests. I think it's in your head. You need to sort things out. It's more psychological. That's all puberty. The headmistress is really mad at you, you know. Show some good faith. No one's a 100% believer. I mean, I do yoga and all that. Go shout it from the mountain tops that Jesus Christ is born Go shout it from the mountain tops, over the hills, tell everyone Go shout it from the mountain tops that Jesus Christ is born Take it. -Thanks. Please get away from the edge. Who didn't get juice? Hey! Where are you going? Move away. One, two, three. Enough. This is small, is there a bigger one? No, Stipe, swap with someone. Take it easy. Easy! Everyone will get a T-shirt. Take it easy. Anyone have a bigger size? -This one is too big for me. What's your size? Sonja, give me an M. There's no more Ms left. Here's one. I've got two. Give it to me. Come on, put it on, so you are all the same. What a mess. Unbelievable. Careful, fuck it! Are you holding it? Come on. Three, two... Go! Is it in? -Yeah. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. You could've crossed yourself. Pull it tighter now. You did it? A bit tighter. Your side, there. Come on, Pero! Faster, Pero. Come on, Jure! Hurry up! Catch up with him, come on! Pero! -He's hopeless. Well done, Jure! Come on, who hasn't swum yet? -Why don't we go for lunch? We can't go for lunch, we haven't all swum yet. This is not a vacation. Come on, who's next? How about the two of us? Frane, go with them. -No need. Come on! -Frane! Frane! Who wants to go with Frane? I'll go. Really? -Yeah. You decided to join in. Finally. It's impossible! Let's go! What's he doing? Hey! We need a boat! We need a boat! There he is. Give me your hand. Give me your hand! Come. Come on up! What was that? I don't know. Don't you fuck with me, okay? One each, Renato. -I wanted one for my sister. If there's any left over, I'll give you one. Here, take this, so you don't get lost in the dark. Hello! I'm going to read something very important. Shall we first discuss what happened? Okay... Does anyone want to ask him something? What's to ask, he's a moron! -Hey, scouts! Watch it! I don't think a friend or a real man would do such a thing. And I think he should get medical help. Why didn't we just leave him alone? To fucking drown if that's what he wants, so what? No. True believers don't do that. Did I ever do anything to any of you? Okay, Goran. Just sit down. We'll leave you alone since you want that so much. But you will be sorry. I want to read something about this exactly. Can I ask something? -Do we have to hear this now? We're tired. I'll pretend I didn't hear that. These are the thoughts of our John Paul II. Please listen how prophetic they sound. They will invade Europe. I have seen hordes coming from the West to the East, from Morocco to Libya to Egypt and so on till the East. They will attack Europe. They will invade Europe. Europe will be a basement, an old relic,a penumbra, a cobweb. A family memory. And you, Church of the third millennium, must fight the invasion. Not with armies. But with your faith, lived with integrity. If I had married her, I wouldn't have withered like this I'm growing old, but still have no faith in love I dreamed of my children, I called them by her name I'm growing old, but still have no faith in love I'm growing old, but still have no faith in love A round of applause for our scout master in Betinac. Now I would really like us to hold hands. Like a real family. That's what we've become since you came to our school. I want us to imagine that this is a world without evil. Where love, hope and faith are victorious. Where we're not ashamed of what we are and what we believe in. Mirela, what's wrong now? Well, it's a bit childish. But it's nice. Can I join you? Yes. Why are you here? Do you mind? -No, sit. Take some. Thanks. This is the story about how God looked at us from heaven. He saw the world filled with sin and people feeling lost, so he decided to redeem them. The story starts when an angel came to announce the good news. I hear a voice. But I can't see you. Where are you? Who are you? I am angel Gabriel and I bring good tidings. You've found the mercy of God. He looked and cast his mercy upon you. You will give birth to a son and he will be great. He will reign over the kingdom of his father and the kingdom will never end. But how can that be when I have not known my husband? The Holy Spirit came upon you and you are with child by God. But... -Shhh, servant of God. In God all is possible. Thank you, herald! Who am I to judge of this. May it all be as you said. I will do my duty. My husband, I am with child. I know we have not laid together. But an angel came and told me. I don't know what to do, have mercy on me. I don't know what to do, have mercy on me. Mary, my wife, believe! In God everything is possible. Bravo, Frane! Blessed are those who have faith. We can't here you! -She's full of spirit! So came the time of Jesus' birth. And another miracle happened. A star appeared in the heavens to show the three wise men where to go, to bring gifts to the prophet. C'mon, leave the kids be. Deep river My home is over there, far away Deep river I want to cross over and find my home Deep river My home is over there, far away Deep river I want to cross over and find my home Don't you want to come with me To the promised land where all is peace Oh, deep river I want to cross over and find that road.
