* I'd sooner it be one of my field boys than you! Like Willis. Dark, piercing brown eyes, with just a hint of hazel. Dark, bulging, glistening muscles nice firm buttocks [squeaking] Sit down, boy. My own sweet darling daughter and Jewel Mayhem's husband?! Makes me sick to my stomach to think of the two of you co-mingling. You're just a foul, money-hungry little gigolo aren't you? That is a great word, isn't it? Gigolo? I believe that it's Italian. My dad used to sit on that verandah buck naked drinking moonshine, let this whole place fall apart around him. I worked my fingers to the bone to bring this place back to the successful plantation you see before you, and I am not, not, I say, gonna let some little adulterer come and steal it from me! Charlotte's all I have. I'm going to protect her from the likes of you. - Your daughter is not a little girl anymore, and there's going to be lots of other men. - and I'm gonna be there with a shotgun if I have to, and shoot every god-dang one of them! What was your plan boy? She was going to meet me out at the shed. Her bag is packed. Then over to the Dramata Inn in Baton Rouge. They got a real nice- Oh shut your filthy mouth boy! So in this plan, what were you going to tell your little - She was giving me a divorce. Well that's not going to happen. You see, Jewel was here last night. - Last night? - Last night. - Right here? - Right here? Right here? - Right here in that chair. - This chair? - That chair. - Last night? - Last night. - Right here. Now when you came in on the verandah there was a couple of chairs. Not those. You go in the foyer, and just before the music room we've got a whole Yes that chair, you jackass! Sat there crying her little eyes out. Told her she wouldn't worry about a thing. Now, you're going to come night with Jewel, your wife. But you're going to meet Charlotte in the shed. What you're going is this: * Big daddy sure knows how to throw a party! I just love all the food! * Mayhem. - I heard that see is having a scandalous affair! - Have you seen Charlotte? - Can't you see I am busy? - Oh, I'm sorry. Hello Drew. - Hello Drew. - Hello. Don't you look real pretty tonight. - I think she went out back with John Mayhem. Yeah, I bet they're doing something scandalous. Some even speak it out loud. - Jewel Mayhem Like s-e-x. Why do you always have to have such a po potty-brain? - I don't, you do. - I don't, you do. Would you please stop that? - Would you please stop that? Alright. I go find her. You're the pretty sister. So all I have to do is grow some big boobies and you'll be on my hip? * * * Paint the town, wear something fancy * * get low down and gallivanting * * you will lose that crown before you know it! Roll off the bed * * you can sleep when you're dead - I'm sorry, Charlotte. I really am. Please don't cry. Someone will love you someday. Maybe. And if not, you can always look forward to growing old here, by yourself. Turning into some crazy old loon. Probably just you and Velma, all alone. Old, old maids. All wrinkly. I got you that real nice music box so you can remember me. I could kill you! * * Drink that up, it's outrageous, * * live in sin, it's contagious, let yourself give in * * it's advantageous! Stay home and scowl or go out * * on the prowl, come on, let yourself howl * * and go crazy, crazy, crazy * crazy, crazy, crazy, go crazy! * [clapping] * Hello? Charlotte? Is that you? [thumping] * [thumping] [laughing] No! No! No! [screaming] * * * [ominous music] [murmuring] * But what if I get caught? - Then you tell her you're John Mayhem and you've come back to take your music box. Now get! * [chiming] [cat meowing, hissing] * [music box playing] [screaming] * * * Hush up, sweet Charlotte * Charlotte, don't you * shine. You heard I was * leaving you, but darling, that's * * a lie. You know I'll * always love you. * Until the day I die * Hush up sweet Charlotte. * That's a long, long time * [birds chirping] Damn you! Damn you all! Grab yourself a rifle, we're going to have ourselves a shooting party Again? - Damn you! Damn you all! - Why in tarnation does she say "you all"? We know who's out there. [rifle shots] [rifle shots] [more shots] Are you done playing around up there? - Damn you Damn you all! Velma, are we our of bullets? - We are fresh out, Miss Charlotte. - Lookie here, Miss Charlotte, This house is coming down no matter what. We got the papers signed on the dotted line and there is n - And where you are, I could spit in your eye with no strain at all! I'm sick and tired of this little turkey shoot we've been playing t I'm gonna have to head on downtown and get the sheriff and he's go Nobody's gonna tear down my house to build a little bridge railroad or highfalutin airport, so you can just clear off my property once and for all! Damn you! Damn you all! - Ooh, Miss Charlotte. One of the most a I have ever dealt with in all of my born days! I used to think that stuff about you cutting off your lover's head Now I'm beginning to think different. * [laughing] If that Sheriff Luke comes out here, he'll be real sorry! - Oh hush-up Charlotte! Now, how does a nice chicken fried steak sound? With some of your homemade biscuits and some of them. - And some ham, bacon, and sausage on the side? Oh, and some of your, your buttermilk pancakes with your maple syrup? And some of those beignets you make. The best damn beignets in the county. - Anything else? Go easy on the butter, I'm trying to watch my girlish figure. That's a good idea. [bells] Thank you so much. Meet Miss Charlotte after waiting for so why would you be coming all the way from London England to investigate a like this? The only journalists coming around these parts is so they can like this. - It's like this, Sheriff. I've never be that I haven't solved. - Sheriff, you've gotta come out to the talk some sense into that lunatic Miss Charlotte. I almost got kil She and that Velma were shooting at me l - Do you mind if I tag along? I won't say a word, I'll just observe, I'll be quiet as a churchmouse. I don't see any harm in that as long as you just stay in the car and obs Mr. Wills. - I'm writing a cookbook about the seven delicacies in these here parts. - Oh, nice to meet you. Is there a Mrs. Stan that I might get some recipes from? No, I'm not married. - Not married? A big handsome, strapping like you? - No, I guess just never met the right girl. - What kind of girl? Sheriff, I'd like to get with that Jewel Mayhem, I'm sure she's got a You know Miss Jewel? - Yes, I've done a thorough investigatio in these here parts. - Mr. Wills, your accent is very interesting. What part of England are you from? Oh, the southern part. * Velma! He's here! - Hey, Miss Velma. How are you doing this fine morning? - Well, I'd be just fine if some people would stop meddling in other people's business. She don't want to see you anyhow. - Well that's too bad, I guess I'm just to come on in and wait until she feels like seeing me so we can discu of shooting at Stan. How are you doing this fine morning? May I say you're looking mighty pretty. - Get out Sheriff Luke! Did you say pretty? Am I looking pretty today? I would be just fine is everybody weren't trying to throw me off and making such a mess and a big racket out there and practically digging up Big Daddy's g - Charlotte, you know you've had plenty of time to pack up and leave before this all starte This house is coming down and there ain' This is so unfair. Nobody asked me to sign anything and suddenly it's become some sort of public decree. I've told you this time and time again Miss Charlotte, papers were s That is not true, and if anyone did it was that Jewel Mayhem, She's always trying something out to get about poor Miss Jewel? She's old and frail and practically senile, co of anything these days, she's quite ill. When my cousin MIldred comes, she'll fix everything. - Cousin Mildred? The pretty one? - Yeah, the pretty one. She's going to march right down to that courthouse and tell them where t shove that decree. Now, get out! Now why did you tell him she was coming? You haven't heard hide nor tail from here since you sent her away I know she's coming. I can feel it in my bones. [Doorbell] Telegram for Miss Charlotte! Dear Charlotte, stop. On my way to help immediately, stop. We'll take this to the highest court in the land, stop. Love, Mildred stop. You see? I told you she was coming to fix everything. Such beautiful weather we're having isn't it? It's gorgeous. It's quite picturesque really. It reminds me a bit of a wedding I went to. The bride wore red Oh, oh my, what an odd coincidence. Look, it's my sister standing by the side of the road. Driver, please pull over. * Hello. - Hello, dear. - What are you doing here? Well when I heard you were coming out here to help poor Cousin Char two heads would be better than one. - Oh, marvelous. - Would you mind helping me put my bag in the trunk, it's awfully heavy. Oh, not you, sir. Sh the exercise. - Drive on. But what happened to the other lady? - She forgot some- she decided not to co One of those excuses will do. Drive on. - But- I said, drive on. - Okay, lady. [bell rings] Well, come on in then. Drew. What are you doing here? I swear, all the comers and goers that are happening today. - Well I stopped by to see if you need a new something to calm your nerves? - That's very kind of you Drew, but my cousin Mildred is coming and she's going to take care of everything. I won't have to leave the house. We can give parties here again. Wouldn't that be fun! Well, here we are. Isn't this an amazing piece of history? - History? Yes. I just hate this place, it gives me - Too bad it's going to be torn down next week. - Oh what a pity. What a pity I'm going hillbilly for every cent she's got. - Did you say something? - I said I need to pee. So hurry it up. * I'm gonna go powder my nose. I will too. - Well, I guess I gotta go out and get her bags. Velma. Velma Smothers. You look so... well. You are not Mildred. - Velma, why would you say such a thing. Of course, - Well, your boobs are so much bigger. I mean, Mildred's boobs were big, but yo - Now, Velma, we haven't seen each other in many years. The years have changed us. Some for good and some for- well. Milli- -Dred! Drew, what a surprise. Why yes. Mildred. I just can't believe it, you look fantastic. It's been so long. In a recent letter I sent you a photo, what did you expect? They look so much better in person. Did you have any trouble with you know w - Oh, it's so wonderful to be back here. It-way as-way easy-way. Ock-tray. Ock-tray! - Yes, I will take care of that one myse Who does your hair? I need to find out because I want to have it done Well I just do it myself. I wash it in lye soap that I make from bacon fat. That's the secret. - So that's why you smell like pork. Well I guess it's time, I'd best go up and see dear cousin. - That's the last of it, I thank you ver and I'll be on my way, ma'am. - I sure hope that that fine lady - - Oh wonderful, wonderful, well don't di to pick up. - Thank you for your generosity. No, no, there are no buts here at the plantation, just hurry along. I s along! As in have a wonderful day. Life. [chuckling] Well don't think I'm bringing in all them bags. Specially not that big one! - Well don't you worry your little hands my dear Velma. Drew will bring them into the house and to the large walk in closet at the end of the hallway by the second bathroom. I should be able to auction all these old pieces for a very good price. - I don't see how you're gonna convince You just leave that to me Drew. I'm the mastermind in this. You're the Rhoda. I'm the Mary. I'll take care of her. - You'll take care of her? Now what did you mean by that remark? It's just that poor Charlotte has lived here for so long, and I will h care of her with the move and all. Them bags are not going to move themselves. Yes, of course. - I've got the guest room all ready for Second door on the right. Thank you Velma. And once again, what a pleasure to see you. You look ravishing. Well, I guess you're gonna be wanting to stay for supper, especially now that Miss Mildred is here. I'm not doing anything fancy, so don't 'spect much. I don't serve nothing, I am out of here before dark. This place gives me the willies after dark. Just fine, Velma, just fine. I am so hungry for your homestyle cooking, but I just have to get the bag, put it in the back of the closet like Mil-dred suggested. * Something sure smells fishy. Charlotte. It's me. Melanie? - No dear, it's Mildred. I got your letter asking me to come. But you've gotten so much bigger. Well, it's been a very long time. A lot can happen to a girl when sh off to New York City, gets caught up in a wild and carefree lifesty and smoking and drinking until all hours I met the right surgeon. - You have come to help me? Yes. - What is it? Oh, the baby Jane doll. Remember how we would play with her for hours? How much you loved her? I never could understand why your sister was so afraid of her, I mean afraid of such an angelic face. - Come here little girl! [laughing] Not me. - Do you do you remember Preston? The boy I dated who went off to war and came back with a Yankee wife? I thought his name was Ashley. - No. Preston. Do you remember the time you went to the big ball and wore that red d Oh, and everyone was appalled and made fun of you, saying, 'lady of th Hussy, whore. And Big Daddy was so upset. That's when I met John Mayhem and and, oh Mildred. You have come to help me? - Yes Charlotte. I'm come to help with everything. Just everything. You won't have to worry about a thing. Not a single thing, I'll take care of everything. Really, I will. You won't even know what hit you. * This was Big Daddy's favorite room in the entire house. He'd just sit in here and eat and drink and eat and drink and eat and drink and eat and drink and eat and drink. And then he'd have a big old cigar. He'd be in here for days and days sometimes. Carrying on, entertaining different business associates. Sometimes he'd call me and have me lift up my dress and show my belly button and we'd giggle. Mildred, you can go into town first thing tomorrow morning and walk st them what's what. - Now Charlotte, you're going to have to I don't think Mildred or you can do anyt - Charlotte, Drew is right. You have to leave the house. But that's just, that's just crazy talk! - Tomorrow at breakfast, we sit down and discuss all this and come up with a plan A plan? We don't need to make any plans. What do you think I asked you here for? Company? Do you think I'd ask you back here just to - just to make a plan? You owe me, missy. Remember when Big Daddy took you and your sister downtown? Bought you whole new wardrobes? - Yes, I remember. Down to a sleazy Baton Rouge- - It wasn't good enough for you? Big daddy didn't give you enough? Well maybe that's what you came swindle me out of all of this - - Charlotte, what's gotten into you? You come here to come and help. And you continue like this? What is dragging up the past going to do for you? - It's all right Drew. Charlotte's not h She's been carrying such a large burden for many years and now with new threat of the demolition of this beautiful old house we all just need to stay calm and come up with a plan. We all know exactly she came back here t house. It was you who went sneaking off to Jewel and told her about her husband and me in the first place! - You seem to be forgetting that was my sister, Melanie. - Oh that's right. I'm sorry. You're the nice one. The pretty one. But you still didn't know about that, did you Drew? Or did you? I know the two of you were having a sordid little affair, but Drew dumped you because you weren't in line to get any of Big Daddy' money. You know something Melanie? - Mildred. You're just a vile, conniving, sour little bitch! Would you like me to get that cousin dear? I'll get it. It's still my house. * Did you take care of Mildred? Oh yes. I took care of her. * Yes? - Miss Charlotte? - Yes? Miss Charlotte Holler? The Miss Charlott - Yes. I'm a reporter with the international newspaper, The Daily Nosey you if I asked you a few questions? Did you kill your lover? - Please get off my property! * What are you two doing? Conniving behind my back? - Oh, Charlotte. - Charlotte don't be silly. I think you've been locked up here with only Velma and myself as your only connection to the world. Too long. I mean, it has altered your perception of reality. Not everyone is out to get you. Yes, Charlotte. I am here for one reason. I only want what's best for me. For you. Like the time I told Big Daddy that his darling little girl was having a dirty little affair with someone who could only end up badly. I- we- only wanted what was best for you then, too. How could we have known it would end up in a horrifically, bloody, disgusting murder that would haunt you and this hou How could we have known that? - Absolutely, how would we know that. But... but you said it was Melanie who did it, not you. - Well, I meant my sister She actually confided in me, although I must admit, I strongly agreed with her actions. In fact, I suggested it. We all knew he was in it for no good reasons. We didn't want you to get hurt. Well, no you couldn't have known that. John. John? * John? John? Everytime I come out here to visit, she's a little worse. She seems to lose her grip on reality more and more She goes up there in that room, puts on that dress, the same dress she wore that night, and she waits for him. Or she goes to the music room and plays that song. The music box that John gave her over and over, again and again. - We have no choice but to follow the pl Come on, Drew. Don't get sentimental on me now. Just think about the money. John. John. - See? She is insane. We're actually doing a good deed. She needs to be taken care of by s Other than that pork-smelling hick! How much more would it take? You know, so that there isn't any doubt? I don't think it would take much. Push her over the edge completely. Really? You really think so? - Charlotte was wrong. I mean, I never left you because of what well, my mother didn't - - Drew! You know I don't hold on to things. Let bygones be bygones and never bring it up again. Don't even think about it. Not even a little b See, I've completely forgotten about it, I've moved on with my life, ok Do you want me to stay here in this house with you? It's a big old scary house. I'll be fine. I'm not a little girl anymore. No, you're not. Well, Drew, are you forgetting something? You said you were going to bring me something for my protection. The gun, you im-patient fool. So I guess you can see yourself out, Drew. Good night. I said, good night. Good night, Meli. See you later. John. * John. [crying] [creaking] My dress! Somebody slashed my dress! [child laughing] Why do you think that she was sent off the London if she wasn't guilty? It's the best way to take To stay here and deny the allegations, proud of it? - That's the thing Mr. Wills. From what poor old Miss Charlotte couldn't remember anything that happened her daddy sent her over there to prevent her from bein charged with murder. - But how, she was the leading suspect. - Big daddy was in bed with the mayor, the governor, anyone of any power here in this here parts. He could do anything he wanted. Do you think she could've done it? No, I don't. Do you? - I agree. Sugar? - Please. Five. One, two, three, four, five. All right? It's delightful, I'm not typically a coffee drinker, I'm more a tea drinker being from London and all. So, I hope you don't mind my asking Sheriff, how did you become the local law and a newspaper man. I guess it's just in my blood. My mama loved reading the newspaper, and my daddy, he loved listening to little orphan Annie on the radio. So I guess that's as good as reason as any. I was the understand that her cousin Mildred is coming to help? That's what I've been told, but I don't know. Now we just have to do one more thing and then we can be done with all o It was such a nice visit, but what did we just do? - Miss Jewel, we have to go file those p plantation in my name. You promised, rem Now we just have to do one more thing and we can be done with all this. Excuse me Sheriff, but I'm a bit confused. If that's Mildred, she's all grown up now. The other lady out there in the black dress, that's Jewel Mayhem. Interesting. As you may already know, Mildred has a sister Melanie, they were identical twins, except for a few things. - What things? What I want to do is go back home, have some tea, and your special scones. - Miss Melanie? But you're quite mistaken, I'm Mildred. - Miss MIldred, my deepest apologies. - It's always so difficult to tell you two apart, except for- [laughing] Jewel. Jewel Mayhem. How good it is to see you after all these years. Can't you even give me the time of day? I haven't the time in my last dying days to give anyone the time of day. Especially the likes of you. Well you must be confusing me with my sister Melanie. Jewel, she had told me that you two had had some sort of spat. You are not Mildred. I love Mildred. I can tell by every fiber in my body that you are that thieving, disgusting vile pig Melanie! Please not here. Not on the public street. I'll do whatever I wish! Now get out of my way you stinky harlot bitch! Murder starts in the heart. Its first weapon is a vicious, vile, disgusting, really gross, not nice, unalluring, loose tongue. - Now, Miss Mayhem, let's go and get you back home where we can get you that tea and a nice scone. - I am not unalluring. I aways did say she was unalluring. - Oh, you never say that. I may not have said it, but I thought it - Will you two hush up? Let's go over there and say hello and find out what she's up to. That must've hit the nail right on the head. Do stop this, Charlotte! - And you forgot this! And that! - Now, who do you think you is going to clean this mess all up? Just because you saw a bit of literature about you and that John Mayhem. Now I thought this was all kind of funny, but you've just lost all your sense of humor, I swear!pp I thought this was a real nice picture of Miss Charlotte. Yes, I see what you mean. Where did you - I bought it. Down at the Piggly Wiggly. I thought it was a real nice likeness of Miss Charlotte, just like I said, and I thought it was g brighten up her day, what with all the goings on and all. Well you obviously were very mistaken, even though I hate to admit it it's a lovely picture of her. Oh, by the way Velma, I've hired your old friends Bertie, Agnes, and Trudy to pack up Charlotte's belongings They'll be here any moment, so please, have them start in the dining ro With the silver. Someone will be by tomorrow to pick up the boxes and put them into safekeeping. Safekeeping, huh? I bet it's for safekeeping. - Worst picture of me on the cover! Charlotte, you know that Velma has always been someone with special needs. I'm sure she was just trying to be amusing. But look at it. It- it looks terrible. I don't look like that. They m done something to the picture. I bet Jewel Mayhem is behind all this. She hates me. All she wants to do is try to make my life miserable. Don't be ridiculous. You're beginning to sound a bit mad. Batty. Irrational, wacky, crazy, delusional, delirious, psychotic, banana and a bit mental. Now, Charlotte, I just saw Jewel Mayhem at City Hall downtown. Crazy as a loon and practically at death's door. She called me unalluring. Crazy. Me. Unalluring. - I'm glad Jewel Mayhem is ill. She deserves to be ill. She deserves to die! I've got evidence. Lots of it. Now do you think I'm crazy? I know Jewel Mayhem is behind this, I have all of these hidden all over the ho Bertie, Agnes, and Trudy are downstairs. I told them to start on silver, like you said. Thank you Velma. - What are Bertie, Agnes and Trudy doing And what about the siler? - Oh Charlotte, I'm so worried about you in this terrible stress. Now later, we will sit down and discuss everything and talk about the plan. Oh, and by the way dear, I picked up something today for your nerves. But what happened today at City Hall? - We'll talk about that later Charlotte, now, drink up, okay? Just one. Now that's a good girl. Well, I'm going to go downstairs and make sure they're doing everything correctly. * Velma! What are those women doing in my house? Damn you! Damn you all! And don't come back! Please, do sit down. I'm sure you're quite pleased that I gave you permission for an audien - Oh yes, I'm very happy. Just to be clear, I've been wanting to sit down with you for many, many, many years. - Really? Well I'm not quite sure why. Montgomery, do we have any of those nice blueberry scones left? Yes, Miss Mayhem. We've got two left. Why not go get them? Oh Montgomery. - Yes, Miss Mayhem? Look what I made you. Yes. Very nice. Very nice. Some goober peas, Mr. Wills? Now, where were we? Yes. I need something from you. - Oh! Well now I'm intrigued. How can I help? - This town is incredibly miniscule. I'm sure by now everybody's talking about my repartee with Melanie today. - Melanie? I thought it was Mildred. Yes. So she claims. Melanie, Mildred, I don't care who she says she is. You see Mr. Wills, I know that I do not have much time left in this world. I'm sick. Fragile. Some say I'm losing my grip on reality. Oh, you're fine. I'm not wearing any panties! I was going to be a dancer. I'm slender, beautiful. But John Mayhem proposed, and I said yes. Oh, I'd loved him ever since we were little together and we played doctor. With popsicle sticks. - With popsicle sticks. - Sticky ones. He said he would see to it that John never ever got any of our family money. So John wanted Charlotte for just one thing. He told me when he'd swindled Charlotte out of all her money, he'd come back to I want you to keep something for me. To give to the Sheriff after I've passed. You see, everyone's out to get me. - Out to get you? This town is filled with dark, dirty little secrets. Dirty little secrets. - Repeat after me! I promise. - I promise Never to open the envelope that Jewel Mayhem gave me Never to open the envelope that Jewel Ma - Even if I'm stripped naked and if my testicles are beaten with tiny little bats! Where did they find these tiny little ba - Just say it. All right, even if they strip me naked and beat my testicles with tiny Until I'm dead and gone. - Until you're dead and gone! Well, now. Wasn't that good fun? Now, how about some of my nice buggrass tea? * Charlotte? * Charlotte. Charlotte, come to bed. Don't turn on the light. It's not real when it's light. It's only real when it's dark. Now come to bed. * [screaming] He's dead! He's dead! He's dead! He's dead, he's dead! Well I think she's plum crazy. - Well, maybe she is, maybe she ain't. - That's what I always say. Well, which isn't? - I don't know. Well I do know. We should do this real slow, because we get paid by the hour. * Charlotte! Jesus Christ Miss Charlotte? Miss Charlotte, please, can I talk with you? I've come such a long way meet with you. - Where are you from? - I'm from England. Oh really? How nice for you. - Yes, I was there to greet you when you came to London so many years ag journalists who stood in line to have a interviews. Big daddy forbid it. - I know. Let me introduce myself. I'm Mr. Wills. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you, but I just wanted to be with you for such a long time. - You really were there? Oh yes indeed. - Then what was I wearing. - Let me think. Hot pink dress and a big green hat? - No. - A snakeskin coat with matching t-straps? - No. - A little black dress, a monkey fur collar? - No. It was a pale blue dress with matching bag and shoes. - Oh yes, of course. How could I forget? And you were just lovely. Then you really were there. - Of course. Well, well what can I do for you now? I've something to confess. I'm your number one fan. You're my favorite living mystery. Have you ever ever solved me? - No. Then you wouldn't be a mystery anymore, now would you? No I wouldn't. - Then what would I do myself? Oh, I'm sorry. I think I've offended you with all this I never talk to people about you-know-what. I know. I'm so glad you allowed me to talk with you about you-know-what. - Mr. Wills, do you think I'm a certifiable demented lunatic unbalanced killer? - Well, Miss Charlotte, that is the big question. Now, I've entertained many the that you've taken his taxidermic head and kept it under the be or you exhumed Big Daddy's body and put Mr. Mayhem in his place or you've kept him under the floorboards and brought him out to celeb and re-enacted that night over and over again, but alas, you're the only one that knows the real truth. I didn't do it. I know I didn't do it. But just lately, at night, things have gotten so crazy in my head, it's made me question everything and everybody. I really don't know anymore. Would you like a tour of the inside of the house? That's Big Daddy. You see, he'd sit in here and eat and drink and eat and drink, and eat and drink eat and drink, and then he'd have a big old cigar. He'd be in here for days and days sometimes. Entertaining different business associates. He'd call me in sometimes and have me lift up my dress and show my bellybutton, and we'd giggle. So, why do you call him Big Daddy? He's not that big. That's not why we called him Big Daddy. So you're, you're Miss Mell- -dred. Yes I am. And what are you doing when she's in such a delicate state. - I'm Mr. Wills and she was kind enough A tour. Isn't that special? I was just showing him the portrait of Big Daddy, it's so impressiv Isn't it impressive? He's such a big man. He was a fine figure of a man. There seems to be- Take you hands off that! You give that to me! Oh Charlotte! Charlotte! Calm down, it's just an old stinky out-of-tune music box. - An old stinky out of tune music box, it's all I have left of John. How dare you call it an old stinky out of tune music box! Get out! Get out! Get out all of you! Get out! Damn you! Damn you all! Charlotte? Melanie? Anybody? * Go! You gotta go! Get out! Charlotte. - Get out! Get the hell out! How did this happen? Big daddy. He was mad about something Get out! - Charlotte! Oh my god! Charlotte. How did this happen? - It was Big Daddy. He was mad about something, he was so angry. Real angry, and he was here. He was right here. - Charlotte, you know that's impossible. Big daddy's been dead for many years. But he was here. Right here. He was so angry. Real angry, he was here. Right here. Yes, I got that he was here. Right here. Go upstairs and go to bed and I'll get some bandages and call Drew. Charlotte. Stop dripping over everything. Real angry. And he's here. He was right here. - Go upstairs! Please? Okay. - Oh, dammit. Melanie? Mildred. - Mildred. Drew, what are you doing in my room? What is my suitcase doing up here? - Charlotte, we're taking you away from today. Especially after last night. - Last night? Charlotte, you just stay put. I'm gonna give you something to help calm your nerves. While Mildred packs up a nice little bag for you. Ow. Charlotte. Drew and I have talked it over, we believe this house is making you do things you can't control. No I'm not, I won't go. Jewel will be sitting down there, waiting for me and laughing at me I can't give her that satisfaction. You see? She thinks Jewel Mayhem is sitting outside, waiting for her to go insane. Is there anything else I can get you Miss Mayhem? How much more of this do we have to endu - Now Melanie, she may be there now But I think we should stay the course and make sure that, when she's qu she doesn't make any sense at all. But she just thought that Big Daddy broke the mirror. I'd say that's p Give me the police. Yes, Luke? This is Velma from down at Holler Plantation. I need to come down to the hotel and talk to you and Mr. Wills right away. Yes. Oh good, good. All right, well, I will be coming right away and I need to get me a nice ham hock so I can make a good stew for supper. Yep, yep, that will be real good, why thank you butcher John. Yes I'll see you real soon. That was the butcher. I just wanted to make sure I could get a nice ham hock for stew for supper. I heard your conversation. I assume you want to make some more of your lovely hair products so you can continue I might as well tell you now Velma, we will be taking Miss Charlotte away from here tonight. Somewhere where she can be take care of properly. So there will be no more need for you or your lovely stew. - Taken care of? Someplace where she can be taken care of? Well I've been taking care of her ever since Big Daddy died, and we've been getting along just fine until the likes of you came. Besides, only Miss Charlotte can give me my walking papers. - You don't seem to understand My cousin is not in the right frame of mind. Oh and by the way, the childish tricks you've been playing here, trying to frighten me into leaving? A more than sufficient reason t Tricks? I didn't rip your slutty old red dress. - Odd, you seem to know it was ripped. I saw it. I saw it hanging in your room. Besides. I know you're here to get your hands on all Miss Charlotte's money. That's why you want to take her out of here and take her someplace and commit her. I know what you're up to missy, missy, missy, miss missy. This is none of your concern. The point is, you are no longer needed. You are being let go. You are fired! Is that plain enough for your lily-white trash brain to comprehend? Now get out. No. I'm gonna go upstairs and tell Miss Charlotte what you've been up to. Go ahead. Tell her whatever you'd like, Come now my dear Velma. You're not exactly the most reliable sort due to your long standing as an alcoholic. What's all this ruckus going on down her Oh, you should be ashamed, both of you! I see everything now missy, missy miss missy, miss missy! Now Velma, don't be ridiculous. There ain't nothing going on here. We're just trying to take care of Charlotte, because she's ill and she needs special care. All right. I'm going. But don't think you're not going to be sorry. Both of you! Yuck, that little pork-smelling slut. Can't wait until she's out of my hair. Do you think she's going to be Now Melanie, no one's going to believe her. Trust me. Well they are taking advantage of Miss Charlotte! I tell you, she has not been the same since that woman got here. There is something going on there that is really bad, it's really ba I tell you! I think they are trying to commit her to someplace so they can get her money! I'm so sorry, what can I do. - Well now, I saw the way she took to yo I never saw her take to no one like she did that, now, you could talk to her, and you could tell her not to listen to that Miss Melanie and Dr. Drew. - I thought it was Mildred. Oh, I heard Dr. Drew address her as Melanie. What if he just addressed her by acciden That woman ain't sweet at all. ou do realize these are serious accusations you're making. What if I cam Oh, no, no, no, that would not do. She just doesn't take to you like sh to Mr. Wills. I mean, she likes you for other things, but she still doesn't trust you. Besides, I'm worried about that Miss Melanie and her charms. Oh, I just don't think Mr. Wells would be as influenced by that wom charms. - I wouldn't be influenced at all by her I've never met that Dr. Drew. - Oh, he's a real looker. Really? See Charlotte, you just needed a good nap. You look much better, and you'll feel much better once you're away old dusty house filled with antique treasures. [chuckling] * Big Daddy. Charlotte. I got to tell you something, you've got to listen [bell dings] - Don't get that. You got to listen to me. Charlotte, these people are out to get you, my sweet. That's not Mildred. And Drew? Well, he's - [bell dings] Maybe it's John coming to get me. Miss Charlotte, over here! That's great, Miss Charlotte, give me more excitement? Now, give me some fear. Really great stuff. This time, give it all you've got. Thank you, Miss Charlotte. * Charlotte? What was all the commotion? * I love you, Charlotte. * How is she? - I would say she'd be tripping real good right now. Probably sleep till morning. - Well I have to figure out how to dispo had made. He's quite charming, don't you think? Amazing work. So, do you think we have her where we want her? Oh, Drew, I love you. - Drew? Where were you? I should say. She's just one little more nudge until she's locked up for the rest of her days. [laughing] Good morning Charlotte! There, what a lovely breakfast! - That's not Velma's southern cooking. - No, I made it. Doesn't it look yummy? - I want Velma's southern breakfast. Where's Velma? Don't you remember Charlotte? You fired her! You told her she was a no good filthy whore and to get out and to never step foot in this house again. I did? - Yes. - I don't remember that. You also mentioned she smelled like pork. I remember being downstairs and... John... [crying] There, isn't that better? Now I'll just take this tray away and you can lie there and drool. Hello? A priceless heirloom. Poor Charlotte will be so upset. Meeoooww. - Oh, it's just a cat. Just an old, disgusting pork-smelling cat. I guess I'll go to the kitchen and get a broom and clean up this mess. And maybe I'll have a snack. Oh yes. A snack would be nice. * Miss Charlotte? Miss Charlotte? Mis Charlotte! * They've been drugging you up! Oh my stars. What kind of crazy trip have they set you on? - John... No, It's not John! John is dead and buried. Big Daddy? - No, it's not Big Daddy, he's dead and Now hush Miss Charlotte, we've got to get you out of here. * Charlotte. I brought you a candy bar. It is chocolate and nougat and plenty of nuts. Doesn't that sound tasty? - Velma? Velma? Why Charlotte, why would you be asking for her? She's gone, remember? You fired that little hillbilly pork-smelling slut. - She's getting me a sweater. A sweater! Charlotte, you're delusional, because that little bitch better not show her face around here ever! - Meeeoooww. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - I came here to check on Charlotte. She seemed a little cold, so I was getting her a sweater. - A sweater. How nice. I was coming to collect some of my things. Is my cousin one of your things? Now get out of my house! This house! Get out! Oh now you're showing your true colors! You're that stinking bitch sister Melanie! - I told you to get out and stay out! - Oh, I'll go all right. I'll go right to the Sheriff's office and tell him everything that's going on down here! * [ominous music] * The filthy pork-smelling whore is dead. No stupid, Charlotte doesn't smell like pork. She smells like- neverm Just get here right away. This is Drew. I'm over here at Velma's and she's had a terrible acciden She fell off a roof. - That's terrible news, Drew. - Velma's dead. You know Velma. She was probably up on the roof fixing her antennae or taking down her Christmas lights from last year or fixing the holes in her roof, who knows. Guess I'd better call some of her kinfolk. Not that she has much more than a cousin out in Lafayette. Thanks for calling. There's nothing more to worry about. Now, I'm the Mary, and you're the Rhoda. Well I guess I'd better be taking the body down to the morgue. We wouldn't want them to know that "Miss Mildred" threw Velma down the stairs and practically broke every bone in her body. Now I have the upper hand, and we're going to follow my plan. Charlotte... Charlotte! Charlotte... Charlotte, Charlotte! Charlotte. Charlotte. Charlotte... Charlotte. Charlotte. Please, Charlotte. Charlotte. Charlotte. Charlotte. Charlotte! It's Mildred. Keep things going. I'll take care of her. * * Hush up, sweet Charlotte * Charlotte, don't you sigh * You heard that I'm leaving you * * darling, that's a lie * You know I'll always love you * * until the day I die * Hush up, sweet Charlotte... * and that's a long, long time... * Nighty night, dear. [laughing] * [laughing] [gunshots] * Look what you've done! You've killed Drew! You stupid, stupid bitch! [screaming] Melanie! Mildred, whatever your name is, please don't call the sheriff, Jewel Mayhem will be laughing at me if she fin killed anybody. Never, never, never, we can think of something I've got lots of money. Lots of money. Piles of money. I'll give it to you. All of it. You can have all of my m I wish to God I'd never come here. All right. I'll get the car and you watc It's the Sheriff and that nosy Mr. Wills. Just stay quiet and stay out of sight. Well go on! Luke, Mr. Wills. What can I do for you? - Well, Miss Mildred. Sorry I haven't been by to give you my r - That's quite all right, I know you have a lot to do, doing Sheriff things and all. [laughing] Well, you sure are a sight for sore eyes. What can I help you with? - Velma. I wanted to ask you a few questions about Velma's issue, there seems to me some confusion with time and such, so Velma came by, she was real upset abo Sheriff, but Charlotte is still asleep, can't this wait until morning? Yes, I suppose it could. I'm sorry. We'll just come by first thing. And you sure are a sight for sore eyes. Oh Luke, you're not so bad yourself. Please give Miss Charlotte my condolences. Yes, this has been a terrible shock for her. Give her my deepest sympathies. - I will, Mr. Wills. - Goodnight. Miss Melanie. - Mildred! - Melanie! I can't do it. I can't do anything else. I don't think I can help you. You can't help me? I'm the one that's helping you! Do you want me to call the Sheriff, Charlotte? Wash my hands of the Is that what you want? All right, then. [screeching] * Do you mind? * I must be the worst person in the world to have killed Drew! - Will you please shut up? - Sorry. Now get out. Don't make me do it Mildred. - I said get out! [splashing] [crying] Will you please shut up? Mildred, they'll be finding him soon and coming to the house and asking questions, and I can't do it. I just can't do it. You have to tell them. You have to talk to them and tell them I I'm really ill and I'm not able to answer questions. They'll believe tha Everybody in town thinks I'm looney anyway. They'll believe that. Jew have a field day with this one. You have to talk to them! They'll find out if you don't! Now really, you shut your mouth! You'll do exactly what I tell you to do. If I tell you to lie, you'll lie. If I tell you to run around town with your panties on your head, you'll do that, too. Do you understand? [horn beeping] Now get out! I'm going to drive the car out back. Why are you going to drive - - Because I want to, that's why! Go up to your room, and I'll come back later to check on you. [crying] * Ah! Ah! Ah! [screaming] - He's here! He's here! He's here! He's here! He's dead! He's dead! * Hush up, sweet Charlotte. Hush up [chuckling] Oh gorgeous! Wow. [chuckling] To a very profitable arrangement. By tomorrow, we should have her fully committed, and it shouldn't be too long you are in charge of all that she possesses. Which I believe is in the millions. - Well, as soon as everything's in my na I'm going to move far, far away. Maybe Paris. Hong Kong. Tuluth. Without me? - Drew. You didn't honestly think that we would be romantically involved, did y I used you. Now you'll be amply rewarded. - But you have forgotten one minor little detail. Velma. You killed her. For me to forget that bit of information, I'm afraid I'm coming with you. I love you, Melanie. With all my heart. Touche'. Oh, my dear, dear Drew, but you don't know the whole story. You see, I've been blackmailing Jewel Mayhem for years. Ever since I just happened to see her kill her husband John in a viole Once I bled her dry and helped her go stark raving mad, I began to work on Charlotte. Charlotte never liked me. She liked my sister, of course. The nice one. The pretty one. Not me. So, I started sending her those letters. She's been getting those for years and years and years. Well that's all well and good Melanie, You seem to keep forgetting that you and I are in this together. And if I go down in any way, I'll take you down with me. Well Drew, when you're right, you're right. Here, darling, let's have a drink then. To us. - To us. Well, we have one more show to put on tomorrow morning, and that's goin to be a doozy. I have to act devastated that my poor cousin Charlotte has gone completely insane! Now I'm just stuck figuring out to do with all these old, decrepit priceless relics. Is something wrong, Drew? - Very strange tingling sensation. My thumbs is going numb! I'm losing my, my footing. My tongue is... swollen. It's like I'm letting go of all my faculties! Like I've been... Like what, Drew? Like you've been poisoned? Some men can't hold their poison. And by the way, Drew, That was for jilting me. Maybe I do hold onto things. [chuckling] [screaming] * * Fix your hair up all pretty, and put on some nice lipstick. * I got you that real nice music box. So you can remember me. * Mildred is actually Miss Melanie. That means Melanie must've gotten the boobie job!pp that's what I always say. - I bet Miss Charlotte just went on a ra and killed Velma and her cousin. - and she probably got away with it, too. Just like she did before. She was living in the lap of luxury. Big Daddy... I gotta go now. They're going to tear down the house, and I have to stay in a hotel unt figure out what I'm going to do. Where I'm going to live. If only that Jewel Mayhem would drop dead so I could buy her house and live there. Still be close to you and John. Don't worry about a thing my little daughter. No, Miss Melanie. Somebody help! Miss Mayhem, she done died! Charlotte! Charlotte, please! Please, Charlotte! Please! Charlotte! - Mildred, is that you? Yes, She tied me up and kept me drugged. Drugged? My stars! I killed John Mayhem. Sorry. Yours Truly, Jewel Mayhem. All this time. * * * * Driver, take me to Jewel Mayhem's place. She won't be needing it anymore. Driver, stop the car. Yes, Miss Charlotte? Get in. I'm moving to Jewel Mayhem's place. That's a marvelous idea, Charlotte. Now, don't you worry about a thing. Montgomery and I are going to take care of everything. Aren't we, Montgomery? Oh, it's so good to be home, and so wonderful to see you. And remember darling, not a thing to worry about. Everything's going to be just fine. Okay. * * Hush up sweet Charlotte * Charlotte, don't you * sigh.
