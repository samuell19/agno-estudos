And why does he have you doing this, Mrs. Dolores…? I don't mind really… my son had to travel, and helping him gives something to do… otherwise I get bored at home. Let's take a look at what Mr. Edgar sent then… By all means. They're nice! Yes, they do a good job. union leaders call for a policy rethinking on colombian household income to speak about a vital minimum wage and not about misery, demanding less inequality minding for instance that congressmen earn a little more than 25 times the monthly minimum wage that is around 24 million pesos. capital news asked people in the streets what they think about this scarce increase in the minimum wage. for most citizens the minimum wage increase the government announced was not what was expected It's a complicated situation. Generally the minimum wage increase is always not enough in relation to the cost of living. I think it's too low. others are even starting to budget to after the government's announcement. food is very expensive, as is rent, so expensive. utilities are so expensive. No family can live off USD$200. One has to pay rent. All monies vanish in utilities, rent and children there's nothing left. What is the respect for the man? What is the respect for the woman? What is respect for that child growing up? out of all the citizens interviewd no one had a positive opinion before the government's decision. Mrs. Dolores! Good morning. - How do you do? - Fine. Please if you can do something with this hair of mine; as you can see… Would you like the same color tone, or lighter? The same, if you have it?

This year Gloria won't come with the kids either… It's going to be eight years now without seeing them. But they have many times told you to go visit, you're the one not wanting to do all the visa papers, so… All that is so overwhelming for me alone… It seems like Steve doesn't like Colombia. That's why. That's because he doesn't know Colombia… No one can like something they don't really know… So, he thinks like a little gringo kid. Look at this dog! You turn the handle and it moves back and forth, Licking his ice cream. Pure engineering. So cute, let me see… Beautiful. It is so beautiful. Well, let me stop now… I'll get ready and we're going.

You were drooling over him. What are you talking about? You were staring. Come on. I won't go if you don't want me to… to my own house, so you can be together. You're so stupid. I'm sorry, Rafael, I almost couldn't get out of the office. Were you inside the mall? Yes, at the same place… Why don't you park and… Did you have lunch already? I'll eat something at home, besides I don't have much time. Ok… Look who's in there! Hi. Say hi to your dad, Ben. The thing is that my brother got a prize to go to the USA, and he wants to go on vacation with the boy… Ben loves his uncle Jairo. Sure, I have no chance for Ben to love me, because since you don't let me see him… and when I call, he doesn't say much, right son? Look, I don't know how the relationship is between you two… but the boy has always been available. That's what you say, but he's always busy with his uncle and his grand-father. My mother, for instance hasn't even seen him in like three years. Look Rafael… I brought you some documents for you to sign. The first two sheets... to start the whole visa process so the boy can travel. My brother will take care of the rest. -For how long? - Just a month. It's good for the boy to know other places I'm planning to go on a journey with him and the girls before the year ends. Do you want to go with your dad? On that, I need you to place your index finger print. Rafael, something else Tell me… What you're giving me of child support is barely anything… with that I can only pay for his schooling. Look Alexandra, you're not asking, but right now I'm going through a really rough situation… Help me out please. Ready? Everything? don't take long I'm in a hurry. Come and give me a hug. Have lots of fun over there, alright? What movie are they showing now? Rafael… How's your health? My stuff is pretty much under control. Really? Very well, we're going Ben… say bye to daddy. So long. Bye. You know... lately I've been thinking that we should spend more time together… keep each other company… we should go to the movies more often, don't you think so? You're so sensitive old man. We could do the same pranks we used to long ago… We could go on a spree, far, far away Really? You made it, my love Here I am. Cutie pie… I want some love. -You do? - I do. How did it go? Fine… I went to Angela's… Did you know strawberries were a great source of inspiration to painters from the XIV and XV centuries in Europe? They were? They represent sin as much as beauty, love, sensuality and passion. There is great tale, babe Tell me… Picture that strawberries are elementally related to water Which was sacred to Aphrodite. When Adonis was gored by the wild ox… The tears shed by Aphrodite, as they touched the earth became… Strawberries. In the age of Cronos it was believed that sharing a strawberry like this one, induced to love and lust but they are also a symbol of innocence and spiritual purity You know so many things... beautiful stories. Babe There is something I have to tell you. That's right, you've been saying that all day long… What is it? I want us to get married. How in heaven am I going to get married at this age… Why not? Because Vicente It's been 15 years since you widowed Dolores Ramirez How many have you, Vicente Camacho? Twelve? Thirteen? Exactly! Who can stop us? Why don't you put on your pijamas, Lovie? So you don't get a cold... Where is it? Over there. Take it. I'm going to shave off. That's a very good idea, Lovie. Because that beard makes you look a little too old. Who can it be? Hi, Edgar. What's up, Tobita. How is it? Screwed up, brother… Every two weeks I'm going over a lump to complete my employee’s pay. But, anyhow, what's up with you? Did they finally give the job at the sports club? No, it's very hard for anyone my age to get a job nowadays… I'm barely getting by with my pension. You should go to the Cycling Association to see if they give you something… Your name has to be useful in any way. Rafa… Sales are not so good, brother. That means you can't do me the favor? Well, yes… I could only get $150… So… How's Millonarios playing? OK. I'll give you the money at the end of the month. I'm leaving tomorrow. I called mother, but she never answers. She can't manage her cell sometimes, that's why. Alright, I'll go now. - Bye, Edgar - Good bye, Esperanza I'll get the door for you. I got it. Don't worry… Bye brother. Thank you, Tobita Lovie, how come you’re asking for loans? Why are we a couple for if you don't tell me those things? You know it the girl's birthday and I haven't gotten her anything, my love. Can you imagine the Priest's face when we ask him to get us married? You insist... Is it for real? Yes, it's very real. A wedding… with a ring? I'm going to give you a ring. Is it a wedding with guests, music and flowers? With our grand-children as pages? I'm going to give you a bridal ceremony with music, guests and big cake… anything you want. I'm not getting married, Vicente Why not? Are you nuts? We don't have to talk about this now, nor explain anything. Of course we have to talk about this now. Why don't you believe me? Because… perhaps… that would have been very exciting… and lovely twenty-five, thirty years ago I expected it many times. Maybe… as soon as you be widowed… or even when my husband died… but I got used to being the mistress, the concubine, the kept woman… I already went through all the embarrassments; I hid and lived all this as a secret Hoping nobody find out about this Always expecting… expecting... you to propose to me… But you were a coward… and keep on being a coward. I don't need to get married now. I'm going to die. What? Why? Is there something I don't know? I must have like five years left… My daughter, my grand-children, is as if they didn't exist… What am I going to do with this house? I need to marry you! To fix the glitches of this house, you don't need to marry me. You need some help with that? Let me do it. I'm sorry Lovie, but... I don't agree with the fact that you borrow money to buy a present to a girl who never calls you, or ever comes to visit you when you have been ill. I am the only one that has always been there for you, Rafael… always by your side… when you get the breakdowns of your condition, when you get aggressive, when you get depressed and all the crazy stuff that nobody else bears. Crisis that not even the mothers of your own children could tolerate. I am the one who always has to apologize at work. I double myself, live and die for you… and when you need your children; there is no one, nor Laura or anybody. I'm still a young woman, Rafael, and I can't have your baby because you decided a long time ago that you didn't want any more kids. You are so selfish! How stupid! Come here. I'm an idiot, how dumb. Come. David, you did not answer me. Do you love me? Gummy, I told you… I love you. Get this, let's go downstairs and make love… then you tell me whatever you want. Everyting is fine... Just drink all that up, would you? I don't want to, seriously. Here… look around, this is your party, it's your birthday, come on! You just want something else. You’re my girl… What can I do? Drink some. I don't want. OK. Let's go back to my room, yeah? Dude, why don't you get it, I need to talk with you. Hi! Does it hurt? Another one over here… Is that better? I hope it's better... Babe… Babe! In any case the meal was very good. Who are you calling, Lovie? Mother. But she doesn't pick up. What are you doing? I don't want to sleep with this on, Lovie… I promise to put it back on tomorrow to go to work, yes Let me help you. - Hold on, wait, slowly. - Let me see. That's it. Thank you. An eyelash kiss. Don't you fall asleep. Your boyfriend is dancing with that tramp, and you're here alone like a mushroom, I don't get it. Megan is cute, and he's right here waiting... I leave you two… Where are you going? Baby, what's up? Come on… let's talk. The whole day, I've been trying to talk with you and I couldn't. So you take off like that? I'm certainly not gonna stay there watching you flirt with that female. Wait! Gummy, let's think things over… I made you a party. I invited all those people, I got alcohol, music… I let you drink… Gummy, we made love today. I don't know, what's happening? What else do you want? I'm pregnant. That's happening. Are you sure it's mine? I don't know, you flirt around so much… with so many guys. Are you aware of the way you're treating me? Are you? Is it mine? Is it mine? You know what? Gummy I'm sorry Gummy. I'm sorry Gummy Gummy Gummy Forgive me I apologize. What's this time, Laura? I was celebrating my birthday. Thanks for letting me know, I haven't been able to sleep waiting for you. What's wrong? Why were you crying? No What is it? Nothing, mom, I'm going to sleep. Why don't you tell me? Life is shit. You're becoming a woman. Good morning, Lovie. Why do you have to go, babe? I told you. It's Laura's fifteenth birthday. I have to be with her. I'll give you a small present for her. Bye, Lovie, I'll call you later. Vicente… Vicente… come
