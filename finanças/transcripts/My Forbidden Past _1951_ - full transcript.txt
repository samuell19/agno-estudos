Goodbye, until tomorrow. No, I'm taking a boat to South America. - Tonight at 8 o'clock. - But how long will you be gone? A couple of months, I got the university to send me. Why didn't you tell me? - I wanted to cut it sharp with a knife. - But why? - You know why, I don't like hiding. - Oh Mark? Come with me. - Just like that? - Just like that. The captain will marry us on the boat. Mark, it sounds so crazy and wonderful. You won't say a word to anybody, you won't say a word to your aunt. You go right on now and pack and meet me on the boat tonight at 8 o'clock. - Will I Mark? - Will you Barbara? Yes. - Barbara, you're late. - I'm sorry Aunt Eula. Come here for a moment, my dear. We are having company for dinner tonight, I have invited Monsieur Duchasne. Monsieur Duchasne is a fine man my dear, a great gentleman. Yes, Aunt Eula. Also, it's proper that money should be a large consideration in your marriage. You may wear your new dress, it is extremely becoming to you. Thank you, Aunt Eula. Thank you Robbie. - In a hurry Cousin? - Paul? Yes, mother. We're dining in home, you know. Aren't you wearing your new dress cousin dear? Is it necessary to pack a suitcase for down to dinner? - I'm going away Paul. - Oh, that's what the suitcase is for. Is it that research fellow Barbara from the university? - How did you know? I thought nobody knew. - Well, you're my favorite cousin. Is it by any chance the boat that sails tonight at eight o'clock? I'd better see you off, it's not Au fait for a young lady to go alone. - What's the matter? - You're not going to tell your mother? Her heart, as a matter of a fact she won't have an attack immediately... not until your entire story comes out. You don't intend, of course, ever to come back to New Orleans. - Why not? - Oh, you'd be a figure of some notoriety. People would be likely to dig into your, shall we say, ancestry. Well, I suppose it's bound to come out sometime... and Mother is old, she hadn't to many years to live anyhow. I don't blame you for wanting to live your own life. You don't blame me? You don't blame anyone as long as it doesn't interfere with you. I don't know whether you should address it Dear Mark or Dear Doctor. Oh yes darling of course, that's much more simple and direct. Very sweet, very commendable. And you will always be here, waiting. Probably dear, mother might ask questions if you ran up to... whisper with the servants, I'll see that it gets to the ship. - Promise Paul. - I promise Barbara. You'll be lovely in your new dress, cousin dear. Lower your gangplank, lower your gangplank. Stand by your lines. And nowadays Mr Duchasne, it's seems to be considered old fashioned to be... proud of one's origins and of one's traditions. Well that is so Madame Beaurevel, for my part I prefer to be considered old fashioned. I feel it's the duty of the... few of us who were left to remember our heritage be proud of it. This is one of the rare houses where on feel it in the atmosphere. You know Clay, there's something about Barbara we may have fail to tell you. Whenever she hears a ship's whistle at eight o'clock, she spills her soup. ♪ The spirits creep, the ghosties run... ♪ ♪ The skeletons rattle and moan, the goblins holler and old souls... ♪ Where's 39, Elisa Street? - ♪ Takes magic to scare off dead bones. ♪ - Thank you. - Buy cute little skeleton for Halloween? - Do I look like a man who'd buy a skeleton? No sir. - Why don't you look where you're going? - Why don't you? ♪ Goblins holler on all Saints eve... ♪ - Is this number 39? - Yes sir. - Does a Barbara Beaurevel live here? - All the Beaurevels live here sir. - The Miss madame and the Mister. - Thank you. My dear man, I suggest that you find yourself an attorney. Luther Toplady, attorney at law. Well Mr. Luther Toplady I'd no reason to trace your name under my souvenirs... And I don't think you have any action against me. I'm not even interested in you, unless your name is Barbara. Barbara? I've come all the way from California to see her. - Paul? - Yes Mother? I wish to see the gentleman. Mr Toplady mother, from California. - Your business please? - Are you Barbara Beaurevel? We are the only Beaurevels in New Orleans. I'm tracing the relatives of a lady who died, a Mrs Crandall. - The records shows... - There's never been a Crandall in our family. This is a matter of a bequest, I've traced a Barbara Beaurevel to this address. Good day sir. But after all mother, you might listen, inheritances can be fascinating. All the diamonds in Africa couldn't join Carrie Crandall to my family. I'm sure you'd forgive me for asking how you knew I meant Carrie Crandall? I see that you have your hat. I came 3,000 miles to see Barbara Beaurevel and I... Barbara Beaurevel is dead. Good day madam. I'm afraid you don't understand our traditions Mr. Toplady. The older I grow, the more I see, the less I understand. Yes, I'm sure life is much more simple in California. Aunt Eula, aunt Eula... - Isn't that... - Goodbye Mr Toplady. - Aunt Eula... - I'd appreciate that you Barbara not... to come rushing down the stairs, it's extremely unbecoming. Yes aunt Eula, the cousin Phillipe is coming home and... There's something more important at the moment. You saw the gentleman who just left this house? You're not to see him again even if he comes asking for you, you're to avoid him. His business was about that rather unsavory relation of yours. Paul? Talk, can't we even shake Barbara's skeleton in private? There's a question of some sordid bequest And of course, I told him that you were dead. - I wish to hear no more about it. - Obviously, we don't need the money. - That's not a funny joke Paul. - I agree. - Aunt Eula... - Well? I want your permission to meet Cousin Philippe's boat. - You want to go alone. - It's perfectly right, just to meet a boat. I don't remember you seen him off when he left for South America. - You don't mind, do you aunt Eula? - I don't think Clay would like it. I'm not married to Clay. He can't object if you're accompany aboard, after all Phillipe is a cousin. Oh, I always loathe him but I shall be happy to carry you to the boat cousin. Paul is always charming, isn't he? Tell Phillipe he must come to dinner. Why don't you get your raps, I'll see if the carriage is ready. Paul. The gangplank isn't down yet. You know Barbara, when you're eager and excited you're wonderfully pretty. Am I Paul? - I wish I had a nice dress. - I can do with some new shoes myself. - Oh dear, what a lucky fellow he is. - Who? My cousin Philippe of course. That's a pity you haven't got money, I'd marry you myself. - Oh, that's a very interesting idea. - Oh, they're coming ashore. Now seriously Barbara, you're the most attractive woman I've ever seen. You're and idiot if you don't make something out of it. I've no doubt you always be there to see that I do. Always cousin, always. Here he is, right in front of you. Hello Philippe. How extremely nice, you to come to welcome me home. Oh, Barbara insisted, didn't you Barbara? - Welcome home Philippe. - My dear beautiful cousin. - Aunt Eula wants you to dinner Phillipe. - How extremely kind of aunt Eula. Oh, you want to get through customs quickly Paul you help Phillipe. I imagine you'll find something to interest you till I get back. Mark Darling, it's been so long. Has it Barbara? Two months can be a lifetime, I never knew that before. And how is your dear family Miss Beaurevel? Oh, Corinne, this is Miss Beaurevel, my wife. How do you do? How do you do? I believe you're the first native of New Orleans my wife has met. As a matter of fact, it's like... eating the core of the apple before taking the first bite. I'm lucky we didn't wait to be married in New Orleans if they're all as pretty as you are. Oh, they're not Corinne, besides, they're most undependable, - Wouldn't you say so Miss Beaurevel? - Would you Dr Lucas? Possibly only the great beauties. Delighted to have seen you again Miss Beaurevel. Goodbye. Hello Dean Casley, this is nice, I didn't expect to be met. - And I'm very anxious to get your reports. - Well, we horses are fine. They have a native drink down there call pulque, terrible. - I see you haven't changed my boy. - I have change, a little. Corinne, may I present Dean Casley, this is my wife. - How do you do> - How nice, you let him work, you hear? - As long as he lets me play. - Alright. Now, suppose we begin tonight. It's also lean, where we first go to the cemetery... where you observe an old creole tradition. - And then to a sovereign dance. - Sovereign dance? Yes. Barbara, you must be practical. You're very well out of it, the man has neither family nor money. Well, I admit he might be famous some day but... well cousin dear, let other people have the fame, luxury is much more pleasant. I don't know what's going on under that pretty hat your wearing but... don't think mother is old fashioned when she talks about a good name.. Paul... Do you mind if I don't come in? I'd like to take a little drive, alone. Don't do any thinking, bad for the complexion. Alright Pappy. - Where to Miss Barbie? - I'll tell you on the way. - Mr. Toplady is registered here sir? - Mr. Toplady? Yes. Would you ask him to come to the ladies' parlor please? - Yes madam. - Take this way Miss Barbie. - Your name is Barbara. - Wait outside the door Pappy. - I'll be in shouting distance Miss Barbie. - Thank you, that's a great comfortment. Won't you sit down Miss Beaurevel? - May I get you some coffee? - No, thank you. Do you know what Carrie Crandall was? She was a sister of James McDougall who has died leaving a bequest to her heirs. I am Carrie Crandall is granddaughter. Well? I'm delighted to find someone who admits Carrie Crandall ever existed. My aunt is been deathly afraid ever since I can remember... that it would come out that my grandmother was... Such a notorious woman. They even point at her grave and make jokes. Even now I'm not sure that Aunt Eula isn't right. If the truth were known, I don't think I could live in New Orleans any more. Would it be so terrible? Oh, you don't know Mr. Toplady, I think I should die. Sit down my dear, I don't think you'll be forced into an early suicide. There's no need of court action or publicity, you see... Carrie Crandall's daughter was entered at the convent of the Ursuline under a false name. She married your father under that false name, I've documented proof of these facts. Furthermore, you resemble your grandmother greatly. - You knew her? - That's how I recognised you. Imagine her with your complexion, with your proud look. - I didn't know I had a proud look. - Just as she had. She married a gambler, he left her before the child was born. She did whatever she had to... for the welfare of the little girl, even to hiding her own motherhood and love. - But she was... - Yes, yes, she was. So if because of what she was you decided to refuse the inheritance... No. In spite of your aunt's wishes you still want the money? Yes, I want the money. Fortunately, the estate can be easily liquidated, it comes from gold. Is there much? - By certain standards, yes. - How much? A little over 900,000 dollars. When do I get it? I'll have the papers ready for your signature tomorrow. You know, at first I thought Toplady was a silly name but now I think it's a love. - Miss Beaurevel... - Yes? I'm not sure I like the feeling behind your smile, I trust you'll use the money wisely. I will, I can promise you I will. Why should I finance you in a brokerage house Paul? Oh, is a business which I'm perfectly fitted. All one does is to by bonds from rich friends, I make you a lot of money for it. I always have plenty of money Paul, I don't need any more. That's where we differ. Miss Beaurevel. Mr Duchasne is been waiting for you Barbara. - I'm sorry. - You're always worth waiting for Barbara. Madame Beaurevel, would you mind if I'd like to talk Barbara alone for a moment? Why, of course not. Well Clay? I wanted to make sure about the costume ball tonight. - I hadn't forgotten. - I'll come by at ten. No Clay, there's somewhere I'd like to go first. - Well, then let me call... - Alone. - Is that wise? - It's what I'm going to do. There's something different about you Barbara. I don't know quite how to say it, it's... as though there was a secret that warms you. - Do you mind? - I mind nothing that you do or are. Even the fact that my family wants me to marry you for your money? If being poor puts them on my side... I'm glad they're poor. If you'll marry me Barbara, I'll do anything you want. - I'll be anything you want. - I like you Clay... better than I ever have before, good bye Clay.. Say goodbye to your aunt for me. - I think you must be out of your mind. - You were listening, weren't you? What's this rush of going somewhere first? Where? If you've listened carefully, you'll know I didn't even tell Clay. You'll lose him, if you keep go on like this. Oh and then where would your brokerage business be? You know perfectly well that we don't approve your going anywhere alone. Paul isn't that too bad? Because this time nobody is coming with me. I'm afraid you're going to have to explain it to her Dean. All Souls' Eve is what I believe you call Halloween up north. With us it's a somehow religious occasion... but there still enough goblins and imps so that we don't treat it too soberly. However, our clear old tradition is that on the Halloween, the spirits of those... buried here return to visit the graves of the bodies they formerly holds. So it is that on this night, one light a candle for the soul of one dear departed. But if one forgets, the soul doesn't become too angry. Oh, you must be a wonderful lecturer Dean. You alone? - Isn't everyone? - Oh, you're a philosopher now. I thought you didn't believe in these barbaric ceremonies. I don't. - Then why did you come? - My wife. Strangers like to see the superstitious customs of this primitive society. It's an interesting smile you're wearing, anything entertaining it. Do you still want to cut it sharp with a knife? - Cut what? - You don't remember. Alright, suppose I do. - Of course, it was such a long time ago. - A lifetime. And we barely knew each other. Partly at all, we only saw each other every day for month after month after month. And still I didn't know you. That may be because you're afraid to know yourself. - I found out one thing. - Oh? You're not much of a letter writer, are you? Who is? - I know something else. - Fascinating, what? You still holding my hand. I don't think I've said anything to the effect you'd going into a physical decline. Oh, then you still approve of something about me. Beautiful hair, warm complexion... exciting figure if a man could see it in those clothes. - But you decided wasn't worth waiting for. - I decided? I suppose it wasn't you who got married? Well? Why Mark? Why did you? I know she's awfully pretty and boats are supposed to be romantic. They are, you try it some time. I don't know what make you do it darling, you couldn't have forgotten, not so soon. I haven't had you out of my mind for a single heartbeat. Darling, it's not too late. You've been using your sex on me, I'd like to know why. - Alright, you can take me home now. - Oh, no. No little trick of yours is going to make me be seen walking with you even among the dead. - You're a coward. - Sure I'm a coward. I also have a wife who's with my Dean. I just assume I'd lose either my job or my wife. Oh Mark, what did I ever do to you? That's what you did to me, so now I warn you, stay away from me. I'm afraid that's the wrong way to tell me. ♪ Buy a candle, for your love one. ♪ ♪ Buy a candle, for your love one. ♪ ♪ Light a candle, at the... ♪ Barbara? Were your customary word mess you planned for years, where were you last night? I'd rather you didn't come in to my room without permission Paul. - Mother and I are waiting for you. - Get out of my room. - After the way you behave last night. - Get out. I don't think maidenly modesty becomes you. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it does becomes you. Remind me to wake you every morning... cousin dear. I really indicated that Clay Duchasne is not a man to be put off too long. Paul, you're not to be a marriage broker. If you and Barbara won't look after this family mother, I intend to do so myself. As a matter of fact... - You want me aunt Eula. - Close the door Barbara. Yes aunt Eula. It was sufficiently unmannerly to break your engagement with Mr. Duchesne... but to let me worry about you wandering alone through the streets at all hours of the Ni... I wasn't wandering in the streets Aunt Eula. Don't be bold Barbara. - As a matter of fact I was at the cemetery. - Who escorted you? - I was alone. - Why alone? Because I didn't want anyone to see me lighting a candle at my grandmother's tomb. - How did you dare? - Aunt Eula, I don't want to hurt you. But the tomb looked so uncared for, all grown up with weeds. - It looked so lonely. - Did anyone see you? No one who knew us. You might have picked another lonely grave and you might've kept your promise to Clay. I don't think you have to worry about me making a rich marriage any more. What you mean? - The inheritance, that's what it is. - No Barbara. - I'm afraid so aunt Eula. - You dare to associate our name with... Not at all Mr. Toplady promised me that nobody will know where the money came from. - How much is it? - It doesn't matter how it is, it's a little. Not even if it's a million dollars? - A million? - Just about. - You're not to take it Barbara. - I have taken it. Oh, but mother, think what a difference it would make. Parties again, servants, a new carriage and clothes mother. Clothes, for you and Barbara, of course. And will that Paul have a new pair of shoes. Thank you dear cousin. - Paul, this is a matter of... - Don't worry Mother, it'll be alright. Don't sign anything without my advice, people are so underhanded. I wouldn't dream of doing anything without you Paul. - You know Barbara, I've been thinking. - Yes? You came to this decision very suddenly. It couldn't of course, have anything to do with meeting the new bride at the boat? Couldn't it, cousin dear? - This is it Miss Barbie. - Are you sure? You listen what I tell you. Come on, let's help Miss Barbie out. Why didn't you let him help you out Miss Barbie? Money is gone to your head Pappy. I hope you'll forgive me for calling unexpectedly. I'm Barbara Beaurevel. I really wouldn't have recognised you, you look so pretty. - You play very well. - I do a lot of things very well. Do you mind if I come in? I'm giving a little party in honor of my aunt's birthday, is next week Friday. I wondered if you'd come? I wonder if I would too, although it's nice of you to ask. - My husband isn't home, you know. - Yes, I know. - You are the girl, aren't you? - Yes. That's very interesting, the girl he left behind and his new bride. - That is what you came to talk about? - Not exactly. - I came to see what you're like. - What am I like? I suppose I really came to find out if you love him. That's very impressive, do you love your husband? - If you don't, may I have him back? - Do you love your husband? I'm crazy about him and he's crazy about me... and besides that, he married me. How did you know about me? A girl would've to be pretty simple not to know when a man is on the rebound. - I see. - And then that day at the boat. Before I'd ever let a man see that look in my eyes. I imagine so. - Is this yours? - Or do you meet all the boats like that? - Not all. - Anything else bothering you? I think you'd want a richer man, college professors don't make very much money. Mark will, I'll see that he gets over this research business. Don't you worry about me. I'm not worrying about you, I'm worrying about Mark. You needn't worry about Mark as long as I have him and I've got him. The way you say that it sounds somehow temporary. It's for as short or as long as I want it. - I think I understand Mrs Lucas. - I'm so glad you do. - It was very nice of you to call. - Are you coming to my party? - You still want me? - You have a beautiful figure, you know. - Yes I know. - You might just as well show off dancing. Everybody who counts in New Orleans will be there, all the most attractive men... even some poor ones if you prefer. - You know, I might just come. - I hope so. - I'm sorry I was angry. - As a matter of a fact, I'm not. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, thanks for classifying me with them Dean. You found me a research, I'll have no trouble classifying you. You know, sometimes you sound like Mrs Lucas. Never underestimate the power of a woman. That's a force you scientists sometimes overlook. Sometimes to our regret, good night Dean. Like it? - It's beautiful, what's it for? - We had a caller. She wanted to know if I was in love with you. You told her? Of course, I told her I was crazy about you darling. I'm fighting next, she would like us on exhibition. Maybe she thinks she's cleverer than I am but she's not. As long as she's willing introduce me to the right people, I don't care. Look, when we make a show for this town, I'll decide the date. - I'd like to see Miss Beaurevel. - Who's calling please? Well, our famous doctor, won't you come in? - I want to see Barbara. - My cousin is dining out this evening. - You're sure? - Oh, my dear fella, of course I'm sure. Thanks. - Is there something I can do? - Yes. - Yes, it's about the invitation. - Invitation? You're shocked? Well, it's rather an intimate... party on honor of my mother's birthday, I didn't realise that Barbara would... - Invite a foreigner? - Oh, that's a ridiculous way of putting it. - I gather you don't approve. - It's not a question of approving exactly.. What was then the first time we met? Just before I went to South America. Wasn't that a matter of disapproval? Oh, that was different, I didn't want my cousin to marry you. Now you don't want me in your house. - You're extremely abrupt, aren't you Doctor? - Even if it's not your house. I'm sorry Dr. Lucas, apparently you don't think very well of me. Sure I do, I think you'd managed to live a very pleasant easy life for a man with... a little charm, less talent and no honor. You know, when I was a boy, Mother used to say when I had... trouble with the street children Paul, regard the source. I'm following Mother's advice. I came here to ask your cousin to kindly eat her invitation, - Now I think I'll use it. - I strongly urge you not to. Good night. Monsieur and Madame Coucher. Mademoiselle Dupres and Monsieur Latay. Senator and Madame Dulonier. I understand you're going in business Paul. Well, I have thought in handling some affairs for Clay. Now, it's not quite so necessary Paul. Doctor and Madame Lucas. I'm so pleased you could come, Mrs Lucas. Good evening Doctor. It was dear of you to ask us Miss Beaurevel. - Dr. Lucas, we met before, I believe. - Under less cordial circumstances. - We're honored sir. - This is my cousin Paul. Delighted madame. I'm sure you don't mind if I ask your wife to dance with me? Whatever the rules are, I'll play them. - May I have the honor? - It'll be a pleasure. I don't believe you've met my aunt. - Aunt Eula, I'd like you to meet... - Wait, I should be able to tell. You must be a Delgar, the nose is unmistakable. - Aunt Eula, this is Dr Lucas. - Aren't you related to General Delgar? - No, I always been sorry about that. - You're not a native at all, no? Well, I'm a native yes, but not on New Orleans, do you mind? < Of course not. Aunt Eula, would you take over the reception for me? Dr Lucas is asked me to dance. Why certainly my dear, always entertain a stranger, is your game. - Many happy returns. - Thank you young man. They're getting on very well, aren't they? That makes it all very companionable, doesn't it? You know, you're very beautiful tonight Dr Lucas. Just my new suit. - Aren't you going to say anything about me? - You're very beautiful tonight. You're a fool Mark, you're an awful fool. Thank you very much Barbara, was a very pleasant dance. You can't leave me on the floor Mark, it's not polite. - Must remember I'm a Yankee, no manners. - I'll scream. Go ahead and scream. It's just the way it used to be, isn't it? Nothing is changed between us. - Well, there's one minor item, I got a wife. - But you don't love her. - I married her. - Why? She's pretty. - You once said you loved me. - Sure, I was crazy about you. I thought you were about me. Was just the two of us, nobody else. I thought it'd be like that for the rest of our lives. - It should've been. - Should it? Your delightful cousin let me know. The first time I met him, just before I sailed for South America. Oh, he did it charmingly enough, he told me as man to man that he'd protect you. He wouldn't let your aunt Eula know that you'd been out with me. I began to look at it, began to wonder. The secrecy, never meeting any your friends. Darling, I told you why, you said you understood. I only understood that it had to be everything and nothing, you knew that. That's why I went away, so I asked you to come with me and marry me on the boat. - But I wanted to. - But you didn't meet me. I suppose you just forgot. But I told you why I couldn't, in the letter. What letter? The one you got when you sailed, I told you I'd be waiting... that we'd be married when you got back. Barbara you're such a liar, there was no letter. - Was Paul. - Now was Paul who didn't write the letter? He didn't let the letter get to you. Mark please believe me, I did write to you. - Alright Barbara, suppose I believe you? - Then it's alright, isn't it? You mean you and Corinne and I can live happily together? She doesn't mean anything to you and you know it. - She's my wife. - You can get a divorce. What kind of people are we? We know what kind she is, I don't see why you worry about it? - I wouldn't expect it. - She's so obviously cheap. She'd leave you for the first rich man she can find. You read people just like books, don't you? Mark please don't spoil our only chance of happiness. Happiness doesn't grow like that. There's no use trying to explain anything to you like... an adult human being, so let's just forget it. Let's forget of us seen each other again, let's say goodbye now and leave it alone. Mark... kiss me once before you go. Where have you been darling? I wanted to dance with you. Mr/ Beaurevel was so charming, if you don't mind. - You sent for me, my beautiful cousin? - Tell me about the letter Paul. You realise of course, that I did it for your own good. You're always doing things for other people, aren't you Paul? Certainly. Now you can marry anybody you please, anybody you please. And I don't have to marry at all. You intend to continue living on my money? - It's all in the family, isn't it? - Yes Carrie Crandall is family. Vulgar language doesn't become you Cousin. What's the matter Barbara? You can't still be in love with that germ detective. I loathe him. Oh, that's excellent. Because between cousins, I happen to find his wife vaguely attractive. - How vaguely? - Not too vaguely. You seemed fairly successful with her tonight. That was accomplished by schoolboy lesson number one. - And she seemed quite willing. - Yes. But you didn't send for me to discuss the lush Corinne's morals or did you? Paul, are you still trying to get 50,000 dollars to start a brokerage business? I don't need it now, dowry. - You're getting no more of my money. - Barbara, don't be ridiculous. - Although you might get the money if... - If what? I want you to make Mrs. Lucas fall in love with you. - When do I get the money? - 25,000 dollars tomorrow, - the rest the day she meets you in an... - Assignation is the word. Yes. That scientist fella must've torn your pride to shreds this evening. You know Barbara, we're only cousins yet we're so very much alike. But you're beautiful. You're being paid to use your charm on Mrs. Lucas. Fire and blood, always go together, let me see his age. Four years old, in his prime sir. Five years, how high is he stand? - 15 hands, I measured this morning. - 14' 3, I'd say. But it's Arabian sir, strength enough to carry a giant. Light-boned, wouldn't carry my wife. - Well, if it size you want Mr Beaurevel... - Leave him for trial, take the rest away. Yes sir. Hello cousin, you think a certain young matron will be... properly entranced by the sight of a Beaurevel on a spirited Arab? A preliminary rendezvous has been arranged for this afternoon. I'm not interested in details. Well, in that case, perhaps I should've drop the whole matter. - Is that what you want? - No. Then my dear cousin, there are certain other expenses which you will have to meet. I've found a delightful old boathouse on the Bayou St Jean. You may have found it a convenient meeting place yourself at one time. If you remember, it'll take a certain sum of money to make it properly enticing. - You already have 25,000 dollars. - Oh, I wouldn't dream of touching that. I'm treating that sum as a sentimental trust. Paul, you just said that... - perhaps we better drop... - Barbara... Wish me well cousin. - I was afraid you wouldn't come. - I was afraid you wouldn't. My dear lady, there's far too much at stake. The most beautiful women in New Orleans were at our party, you outshone them all. - What's the matter? - That was my first party and my last. - Good, then I'll have you all to myself. - I don't think you understand. - I'm not going to see you any more. - You heard gossip about me. Whatever you heard happened long before I met you. Has nothing to do with you, it's my own decision. What gossip? Never mind, it's not important, tell me, what do you trying to say? Meeting you at the ball was so important to me. I know it's not your problem, it's mine and mine alone. - And I'm not unaware of your charm. - The Beaurevel luck. - You also know I'm a married woman. - The Beaurevel luck. Exactly, you're a Beaurevel with money, position... - I dare not see you again. - Have you considered my feelings? I want to stop it before there are any feelings. I see. Oh, how charming. Corinne, you're right, we won't see one another again. Oh, no. Well, what I mean is, maybe we shouldn't be too hasty. Maybe it won't be as difficult as I thought. No, it won't be difficult at all. Seems that every year our budget becomes larger. Because every year there are more students, more teachers. I suppose progress is costly. By the way, how's Lucas making out? Dr. Lucas. Fine, fine, good man. I'm delighted to hear that, I was a little worried. - About what? - Oh, it's nothing of any consequence. It's just that, well Lucas's background is perhaps not the most desirable... but it's of no consequence. Just a moment Mr. Duchesne, what about Dr Lucas's background? Well, his background is ridiculously inadequate... for the importance of the position he holds. In fact I understand he worked as a common laborer on the Brooklyn docks at one time. Yes, so he could study medicine at night. I'm glad to see you so vigorously defend one of your faculty. However Lucas's contract is up soon and, well it... occurred to me at that time you might want to find someone more suitable perhaps. Oh, but Dr Lucas has a brilliant future. Some day you'll be proud we had him in our Faculty. I hope you're right, good day. - I hope I'm not disturbing you. - Close the door quietly please, I don't want any little gusts of air. - You made me miss. - I'm extremely sorry. - Not at all. - A mathematical experiment? No, it's a gambling game. Paid my way through college with it. - Sit down please. - Oh, but that's your chair. It's my only chair but you're trustee of the university. Lucas, I happen to have a friend. - You're a lucky man. - In any event. This friend had noticed that... Miss Beaurevel seems to take rather a dangerous interest in you doctor... - if I may be blunt. - Oh, do be blunt, by all means. - Well, there you are. - Where? - A creole would understand. - I come from upstate New York. - Coffee Mr Duchasne? - No, thank you. I'm in a position to secure for you a full professorship... at any of several Northern universities. - May we be blunt again Mr. Duchasne? - By all means. You're bribing me to relieve Miss Beaurevel of my dangerous presence. I'd much rather you didn't put it that way. I know, we Northerners are so crass, all business crass type. So how much would you pay me in addition to the job? You leave me at a loss Lucas. What you fail to realize Mr. Duchesne that I come... from a very old and honorable family in upstate New York. My honor is necessarily expensive. Would 5,000 dollars be too much for your mythical friend? 5,000 dollars is a lot of money. Let's be business like Mr Duchasne, 5,000, yes or no? Very well, I can arrange for you to leave the university here at once. Do they still have duels in New Orleans Mr. Duchesne? Why? When you find out what a fool you've made of yourself... you may want to call me out on the field of honor, I think they call it. - You've been laughing at me. - Forgive me. There's so little to laugh at around here. Unless you want to join me in a game of chance. Gently with the door please, it deflects the cards. - Hello Cousin. - Get out of my room Paul. Happily, as soon as you've given me a check for 25,000 dollars. I gave it to you. Ah, but you promised me a similar amount when a certain transaction was concluded. And you have? The esteemed Dr Lucas will not be dining at home this evening. He's entered into a series of very important experiments. And will probably remain in his laboratory through the night. Extremely elevating, I'm sure. - Don't be charming Paul. - I'm afraid I can't help it. You remember the morning I pulled you out of bed... and you slapped my face, how charming I was then. I don't see what all the idiotic women see in you? You nauseate me. Corinne will meet me at the boathouse 9:30 and... may I say that she would come sooner except that she could never get a night off. - Alright Paul. - And the check? - Tomorrow. - Amazing, isn't it? I trust you. We're both nauseating people, aren't we cousin? - I must get a lock for that door. - That's the wrong door to lock. Look, I'm busy. Say whatever you came to say and then leave me alone. - This probably won't interest you but... - Probably not. - I remember your telling me how cheap I was. - Yeah, I remember. That's why you ought to lock your door at home. I think you'd better be very careful of what you say next. I will be, only the exact truth. While you're here saving humanity, your wife is out with another man, being human. Your stories come out of the same box with anonymous letters. People pay very little attention to them. Do you remember a certain boathouse on the bayou? - Vaguely. - That's where. - Now, may I get back to work? - Of course you may, if you can. Hell hath no fury. Happiness doesn't grow like that. But there's no use trying to explain anything to you like... an adult human being so let's forget it. I'm not sure I like the feeling behind your smile, I trust you'll use the money wisely. We're both nauseating people, aren't we cousin? - May I have some more wine? - You need some more? - Paul, don't. - Why not? You came to meet me in a old deserted boathouse... that's not exactly like having tea with your aunt Agatha. - No Paul, I don't like cheap affairs. - Neither do I. Darling, you're just what I've always looked for. I'd want to marry you even if you weren't a Beaurevel and were poor. That's sweet but I never discuss marriage with married women. - But I could get a divorce. - A divorce? For me? Yes darling. But darling, I'm constitutionally opposed to marriage. I don't why that subject should spoil our evening. - But I do. - No, no you don't really. No Paul. I told you I don't like cheap affairs. I begin to see how Lucas got caught He was the first step up the ladder for you. Paul. Well, don't be too ambitious darling, I've no intention... I'm sorry Corinne, I didn't mean to... Corinne... Corinne. Mark. Go on home, go on home and stay out of this. Hello Barbara, I suppose you're annoyed with me. Unfortunately, I'd change of heart, I failed to keep the appointment at the boathouse. - There comes a time in a man life... - I was there Paul. I saw you run away. It was an accident. - You killed her. - I told you it was an accident. I'd no intention of killing her, not even of hurting her. - Mark found the body. - Did he see me? What did he say? - No. - What did he say? What happened? He told me to go home, to stay out of this. Yes, very proper. He'll protect your fair name. You see, association with some of the better families... of New Orleans has taught him the manners of a gentleman. - Paul, they'll think he did it. - Yes, I'm afraid they will. In any event, he'll find himself in a rather unpleasant situation. - What are you going to do? - Me? Cousin dear, I hope you remember that you're equally involved... and perhaps in a more distasteful fashion. - Are you going to the police? - The police? Why, of course not. If I'd admitted this sordidus affair I honestly do believe... no decent house in New Orleans will be open to us. And I don't think you're going to police. You don't want the newspapers to know the real... story of your inheritance or your unholy ancestry. They might realize that you come by your depravity more dishonestly. We spent the evening at home. You were playing the piano, I heard you. And I was reading, you saw me. A very good book too. Barbara dear, no one is worth so much worry. Look around you... our acquaintances, our associates, our friends, revolting, aren't they? This research fella is not even one of our circle. Now Barbara, forget them, all of them. Let's consider ourselves. You once said we were nauseating people, you were right. Of course. Good night, Cousin. But if Lucas really did it, why did he call the police? Don't be naive Dean. By you own admission, Lucas is no fool, he wanted to avoid suspicion. For whatever reason he had, he killed his wife, called the police... I refuse to believe Dr. Lucas is guilty. Your loyalty to your friend is admirable... but even you must admit that this unfortunate publicity has somewhat vitiated his merit. Therefore, you will rescind Dr. Lucas's contract effective immediately. - See that he leaves the ground at once. - Surely you realise the injustice of this? My fellow trustees are in complete agreement with me. You'll also send the announcement of our decision to the newspaper. - Gentlemen? - Good day sir. - Good day sir. - I'm sorry Dean. Good day. Come in. Come right in. Wouldn't you like one of my little pets as a keepsake? The inquest is tomorrow. I know. I've been setting my house in order, how about yours? It was an accident, but it's my fault Paul's, not yours. Oh, I think I've read enough Sherlock Holmes to be able to figure that out by myself. Alright Mark, I've ruined your life and your career please tell me what to do. I don't think there's anything else for you to do. You've come here to me and made what is call a clean breast of it. Your purpose is been served, now you can tell yourself there's nothing on your conscience. - Mark. - Isn't that really why you came to me? Do you really not know what to do? Isn't still an... absolute refusal on your part to face yourself? Because you won't, you know you never will. That's why our back-door affair was held in such strict privacy. From the beginning you were afraid of what your charming aristocracy might think of it. Maybe you're right. Well, you have all the time in the world to think about it. Now, if you excuse me, I'd like to say goodbye to the rest of my little friends. Members will come to order please. Have the doors closed. The inquest is in session, the doors will be closed. This is an inquisition into the facts in the case of death of one Corinne Lucas. The jurors will hear only the facts pertinent to the case, is their responsibility... to judge from the evidence introduced whether the death was from natural causes... from an accident or as the result of homicide. It is not the jurors' duty in this inquisition... to judge any of the witnesses either guilty or not guilty... but it is within the jurors' duties to advise me to deliver the body of any witness... or any other person whom they may think is responsible for such homicide. Ah, call the first witness please. Who else was in the boathouse when you got there? This gentleman here, Dr Lucas. What was the attitude of Dr Lucas? I can't seem to think there was any attitude. - Was the room in any disorder? - Well, yes. Did it appear to you that there may have been a struggle? - I was certain, there must've been.- - Thank you Sergeant, that is all. Next witness please. It is been testified Doctor, that the deceased was found partly in the fireplace. Would a fall against an andiron have caused her death? I should say so. Yes. Would the fall have been a natural one? Even an attack of vertigo would not cause such a fall. I don't know why in the world you came here Barbara, why did you Barbara? Barbara is rather interested in these sordid spectacles, as a matter of fact, so am I. Next witness please. And where you go when you left the university? To the old boathouse on the lake. And what did you find when you reach the boathouse? - My wife was dead. - You say she died before you arrived. That's what I said. What made you go to the old boathouse? I understand you had important research scheduled for that night. - I had a premonition. - What kind of premonition? - I'm afraid it's beyond explanation. - Just a premonition? - No one gave you information? - No one. What did you expect to find when you reached the boathouse? I don't know. You had no idea that your wife might be there in the company of another man? Look here, this is an inquest, not a trial. You're supposed to find out facts, not motives. Because you see, I don't think you'd understand my motives. Now, tell us once more about your arrival at boathouse. It was empty you said, except for the body of you wife. So you intend us to believe there is no witness for or against you? If there had been anyone else present, do you think he or she would refuse to come forward? - I'd asked you a question. - And I answered the question. Careful Barbara, it's showing in your face. Dr Lucas, your manner is so evasive and your facts so uncertain... I'm sure that you will feel with me that you are withholding the truth from us. I should like to remind you that you are in a situation of great jeopardy. I don't think I need be reminded. Then you have nothing further to tell this investigating body? Nothing further. Even considering the fact that you're about to be taken into custody... - for indictment before a grand jury? - Nothing further. - Can I recommend... - Wait, wait. Have you any evidence to offer this inquisition? - Mr Coroner... - Yes Mr. Beaurevel. My cousin is under great emotional strain, she's overwrought, may she be excused? The jurors will disregard this outburst of Miss Beaurevel... - the good name of the Beaurevels will... - The good name Carrie Crandall is name? I'm the granddaughter of Carrie Crandall, the notorious Carrie Crandall. If this person wishes to speak, let stick to pertinent facts. Dr Lucas's wife was dead before he got there. My cousin Paul was with her at the boathouse that evening, I bribed him to meet her... I bribed him with Carrie Crandall is money. I tried to stop it but I failed. I was there outside when she fell and I saw him run away before Dr Lucas got there. These are the facts and I swear to them. This inquest is recessed until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Spectators will please leave the room, the jurors are dismissed. Blood will tell, my angelic cousin. - You're coming along with me Beaurevel. - Not Mr. Beaurevel? You're coming along with me. - Barbara... - Oh, Aunt Eula. - If only I could've spared you this. - I warned you not to take that money. I haven't many more years of life, but you've destroyed every one of them. And I hope all your days will be as empty and bitter as you've made mine. Stay away from me, stay away from my house. You and your grandmother are two of a kind. Oh Mark, take me away. Anywhere, wherever it is I can hide. You can't hide, you can't leave here yet. I can't bear to face anybody again, please. There are a few things that you'll have to face. You'll be at the inquest when it reopens, you'll have to face the people. You'll have to face yourself, finally. You know it just could be that... if you do all those things you might turn out to be quite a woman.
