What you're looking at is not Jonah Paxton. Jonah Paxton is dead. What is your desire? I want a better life. I want money, power, women. I want it all. But I want the world to know about the masterpiece that I have created. Enjoy. Look at me. Wake up. It's about time you finally came out, I've only been asking you for, like, forever. Well, your friends aren't really my style. Yeah, well, tonight it's just you and me sis'. Hey, girls. Excuse me? Would you like to party? - Yes. - No. See? This is exactly what I'm talking about. I'm not a party girl like you. I think I should just go. I mean I'm not even good at skating. Hold on there, sugar shorts. Cool your jets. Me? I skate like a monkey fucking a football. But my boy, Jonah, over there will show you the ropes. Rock 'n' roll. Speak of the devil. You look like you're all tuckered out. What's that mean? Just like you need some shut-eye. You know, a place to sleep? Yeah. Maybe. I know a place, a couple of hours up the road. They got decent food, rooms are ok. So, what brought you to America? It's a long story. Where's your village? Back in Czechoslovakia. Isn't that in Russia? That's a communist country. How did you get out of there? Uh.... What are you asking me? To show you my documents? Oh. No, no, no. You know. Isn't that actually that motel you mentioned before? I... I really need to lay down. Ok. Let's go. Well, you look lost darlin'. I'm fine. Yeah. You're right about that. You are fine. Hmm. - What do you want? - Question is, what do you want? You look tired and hungry. I bet I could probably wrangle you up a room for the night. Really? Why would you do that? Tryin' to help a gal in need. Here. Take this key. I work at the bar over there. Same owner as the hotel. Sometimes she lets me stay for the night. So I can get rest between shifts. That's cool. Ok. Why don't you go take a nap, huh? Thank you. Are you sure you won't get in trouble with your boss? Why would that be, sugar? For giving me a free vodka? Listen. On my shift, I run the place. I am the boss. Howdy, cowboy. Kate. What the hell are you doing here? You know, I just couldn't sleep. And? Well. So, I figured I'd come over here and see one of my favourite bartenders. You know, there are only three of us in this town? So... don't know how much of a compliment that is. Yeah? Well, you're the only one that drives me crazy. It's funny. I know someone that looks a lot like you that, uh, once told me to fuck off and threw an ashtray in my face as she walked out. Come on. I got drunk and a little jealous. Let's just make up? Where the hell did you get that? Don't worry about it, cowboy. Suit yourself. Come on, handsome. Francesca. Hey. Nice to meet you. Where you from, Doll? Czechoslovakia. From where? Shit. Is that over in Europe somewhere? Never heard of that. Lowell. Hey, buddy. How's it, uh? How's it going? Er, losing my tips for the night. Well, that's 'cos you're playing Kino. A game for old ladies and retards. You want to do some actual gambling. You should go over to Linda's house. You know? The lady who plays poker with actual cards? But she is an old woman. She's more man than machine. She cheats. Lowell. Listen. You see those ladies down there? Kate's one of them. She wants me to, er, do a little partying. And I, er, think I might be able to get something going with the three of us. I mean, me, and the two ladies. Come on man. That's the third time this week. Listen. How much you down? About three large. How 'bout I take care of your marker? Ok. That's cool. One other thing. That European chick? Make sure she gets super drunk. Run up the tab. I'll take care of it tomorrow? Alright. It's a deal brother. How do you like it big guy? Nice huh? Oh, God. My childhood's fried. How did we get out here? I can't drive for shit. We walked here. Why the hell we do that? Because I knew you wouldn't be able to drive. Oh. It is so fucking quiet. We're staying the night here. That is so romantic. Don't be gay. Hey, Kate? Yeah? Did you ever think about me and you? What you got there? Er. Never mind. Tell me when you really want to get fucked up. What's this? It's 70% pure. Shit, really? Why haven't you done any yet? I've been saving it for us. Oh my gosh. Very pure. - How do you like that shit? - It burns. Buenos "naachoos", Señor. Well if it isn't the prince of Persia come waltzing in to my sanctuary like there ain't no problem. But you know there's a shit storm coming for you brother? Yeah. You ain't kiddin'. Shit, you got baby on the way, no money, no plans, not even a fucking ride. Who the fuck are you to judge? You have to give out fucking drugs to get fucked. Really? Yeah, really. Really? What? You leave Kate the fuck out of this. Got a thing for Kate, huh? Guess you don't mind sloppy seconds? I had a crush on her since God damn middle school. All because arseholes keep on fucking hurting her and she comes crying on my shoulder all the God damn time. You know what my biggest mistake was? Introducing her to your punk arse. Look at me. Look at me. I'm your mother. Look at this. Sweet. And Chalupa. Oh. Honey, you are looking fine. You know Betty, right? This is her little friend, Jonah. Let me take your bag. Don't touch me. Get your fucking hands up, Gringo. You move, you have no head. Get it? Ok. You're clean. Hands up. That's my girl. Soft and sweet. Alright, Vámonos. El Jefe don't like his peeps to be late. Move. Come on, come on. Hurry up. Not you, maricón. You go back and wait in the car until I call. They're clean, sir. Good, good. Have a seat. Would you like something to drink? Nothing for me, thank you. Two shots of Tequila. Yes, sir. Coming right up. It's good to see you, Betty. Gracias, El Jefe. Call me Miguel, like you did when you were a child? Ok, Miguel. My niece told me that you had a director for my film. Is this him? Si. I'd like that. Now prove it to me. Kill this man. Give him the gun. Look at me. Bueno. Norman was an informant. What do you want? And how much? Straight to the point. I don't talk money. That you go talk to my accountant, Alejandro. I want to talk production value. What I want is a masterpiece of gore. I like horror movies but I get upset when the young female protagonist gets away. You will be my antagonist in this film. I want you to be an artiste. I want you to become evil. Be the monster. Even though you will be paid handsomely, I want to see you take delight in your work. I want to look to your eyes and I want to see your wicked soul Be the soldier. That's no problem. Just tell me how much. I'll give you a masterpiece. Chupacabra! Get rid of this rat. Betty? Go introduce Alejandro to our future Picasso. Si, Miguel. Come on. Yep. This is Jonah. How about a little ambience, huh? Do you ladies want to be celebrities? Yeah. I want to be a big celebrity. How about some more drinks? Your coldness is your power. Express your anger and surprise me. Showtime ladies. You girls want to take it to the next level? Now you're talking. You want this? Do you feel like a celebrity now? Huh? Look. You see that? That's the face of a celebrity. Inside voices now girls. We don't want to wake daddy. I'm a mother. I had a mother somewhere. Never met her. But look what a great guy I turned out to be? Mommys are so overrated. Yes they are. Kate. I'm kind of in the middle of something right now and you're being really annoying. What do you want, huh? You'll get your turn, huh? You're about to have a child. Don't do this Jonah. You could still be a good person. She's a mother. You understand? Leave her alone. I do understand. That's why I got to kill you two bitches. You're an animal. End this now you sick fuck. You're way to stupid to ever get away with it. Watch me Kate. Watch me. You like this don't you, huh? You like this. Look at the big man. Can't even get it up. You shut the fuck up. You'll ruin everything. You fucking hear me? God damn it, Val. What you doing here? Nobody invited you. You just ruined everything. Olly olly cloroxen free. Get out of the way. Sit down. Watch the game with your old man. Bottom of the eighth. No strikes. What you think? Um, we're being really bad, huh, father? We? Who's we? Who's we? I... I don't know what you mean. Our team. Who's our team? Who's we? You hear the door? Get off your ass and get the door. I brought casserole. Thank you, Jonah. See you called Elmer. What's up, Pal? Yeah. Glad you could make it. Just have a seat. I'm talking to my son about being a champ. Going to be a pitcher, right? Yes, father. I brought casserole, Elmer. Any mayo in it? Ain't no mayo in it. Stick it in the kitchen, I'll be there in a minute. You gotta re-up me man. I'm crawling out of my fucking skin. I can pay you back, ok? Put the fucking casserole down, Matt. Ah. Listen. You're my brother, but we're talking about the Mexican cartel. Alejandro's territory, man. I've been covering your marker, but if you don't come up with something they will slit our necks and then they will rape and they will kill that little Jonah boy. Elmer, I love you but it's time you stopped fucking around, pal. I can't leave here empty handed. Come on mother fucker. Just give me a little bit. Take it easy, burner. Aim that somewhere else, buddy. You owe a fucking load of money. A load of money. Killing me it just, it takes out the only bargaining tool you have. You need me to keep you alive. Fuck. What else you got? If they pitch a no-hitter, I can get some cash from the bookie. That's a ball game, right? One ball games winnings, right? I need more than that. What about the money you guys got from the job you pulled in the city? I put it on the fucking game, dude. You put it on the game? You're a moron. Fuck you. You fucking moron. Fuck you, motherfucker. You fucked yourself man. What is this shit? Oh Jesus, Elmer. Why you reading this shit? I told you to watch the game. Elmer. You're never going to be a fucking man. Come here. What about him? Huh? Jesus Christ, Elmer. No, what about him? Jonah. Yes, sir? Go put it on. But daddy, I didn't... Stop whining like a little pussy. Go put it on. I fucking tried to change him his whole life but I fucking knew he was going to turn out to be just like one of you people. Decency, Elmer. This isn't necessary. Oh, there she is. You like the princess, huh? You like this little girl? How much you give me for her? How much will I give you for her? Turn around boy. Slowly. Don't fucking look at me. Do what your Uncle says, or else. Oh Jesus Christ, Elmer. What in God's name have you been doing to him? Just doing what Pa did to us. Trying to make a man out of him. Alright? That's what I've been doing. Look, Pa was harsh to say the least, but you're a monster, pal. Look at me. Man. Fuck, yeah. Come here, come here. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to take him under my wing, and I'm going to clean him up. Alright? Fuckin... Ah, no, no, no. He's my pony. Alright. Don't damage the merchandise. Stand up. Hey bud, you and I have no more words, no more business, no more deals. Ok? Even? We're done. We're out. Go, kid. You belong with me. Open the door, kid. Go wait in my car. It's over there. Now this bag might last you a couple weeks. Depending on traffic. Your debt to me is scratched. But, Jonah belongs to moi. I don't want to see you again. No, no, no. Do you like that, huh? Son of a bitch. I said "Shut up!" Who the fuck are you? I'm your mother. No, really. Who the fuck are you? I came here right now to save you from yourself. I know who you are. You're bad. I know I did a lot of bad things to you. Because I hated you. I hate everything about you. You remind me of your father. Your eyes. You're cheeks. Your nose. He was a bad man. So are you. You don't fucking know me. Oh. I do. I know you can't forgive me. Because I know what happened to you. I know what happened to you. And I let it happen. I knew when they touched you, and they molested you, and they did you wrong. I did nothing about it. But I didn't care. Because I hated you. Bitch. What the fuck do you want from me? I've tried to go back now and save you. To save us. It's your second chance. I know what you're about to do. You're going to kill those girls. I want you to kill yourself. This is the same gun your father shot himself with, in the head. Now I want you to take this gun put it in your fucking mouth and kill yourself Take it. Put the barrel in your fucking mouth. You think I'm going to kill myself? Yeah. Maybe I belong in hell. No, you don't. With this you need to buy the fucking ticket. Oh. You think you're going to shoot me? I'm already dead. Take the fucking gun, put it in your mouth and kill yourself. Now. Pew. Big mistake. Don't walk away from me. Don't you walk away from me. Where you going, bitch? Get away from me, Jonah. Where you going, bitch? I'm coming after you. You got a name, kiddo? Yes, I do. It's... Sorry, it's kinda... Valerie. Sorry, I'm not out much. That's a waste of a smile. Close your eyes. I'll lead you. I'm sorry. I just haven't seen anything like this before. It's alright Woodsy I've seen things like this and worse. Much worse. You wouldn't believe the things I've seen on the job. You start to see ghosts. They'll wake you up at 3:30 in the morning. The Witching Hour. And they will haunt you. You'll be tempted to turn off your emotions. But don't. Sometimes that's all you have to hold on to. To keep your rational, unbiased, and to do your job. You copy me, partner? I'm fine, detective. It's just a little virus that's been going around. I'm fine. Let's go back to light a fire under this fat fucks ass and get him talking. You must be Mr. Hoffman? Huh? Mr. Hoffman, we just need to ask you a couple of questions. I just saw her yesterday. Think you feel up to it, son? You want some water? Something to drink? I got a handle on it right here, officer. Mr. Hoffman? What time did you discover the body? I just got off work at my graveyard shift. Picked up some scraps for the pup. Took him outside and the he started to dig. Kept on digging and digging, and... And what, son? And then I saw her body. And her face. What about her face? It was gone. Then you knew the victim? How did you know the victim? What was your relationship to the victim? My relationship? She was my friend. I... I loved her. But when I get my hands on that son of a bitch. Woah. Slow down. What son of a bitch we talking about, Lowell? You saying you might know who the suspect is? Suspect? He's the god damn killer. It's that cold hearted, son of a bitch, Jonah. What makes you believe he's the suspect? Believe? I know. He's the devil himself. Give us a sec', kid. What are you thinking, Woodsy? I want to know why was this body in your pal's backyard? I'll have him booked and taken down to the station. Officer. Sir. God damn it. Morning, sir. Morning. What's going on? I'm detective Woodbridge. Yeah? Mr. Paxton. Do you mind if I call you Jonah? Jonah, I just want to ask you a few questions. Well, I'm, uh... getting ready to go to work right now. It says here that you work at a local bar. The Mighty River. It says here that you work graveyard shift. So how come you have to go to work at this time in the morning? What's this all about? What was your relationship with your co-worker? Relationship? Kate Sheppard. Well, I haven't seen her at work the last couple of days. Remember exactly what date? What's going on? Why are you here? Miss Sheppard's body was found earlier this morning. And we're just talking to family, friends and co-workers. Damn. That's too bad. She was, uh... She was a fun girl. Oh yeah? How so? We hung out a few times, just had some drinks, nothing major. You know? If you can think of anything more... specific. Yeah. I'll be sure to do that. You are a dirty, pathetic little boy. Cleanse yourself to the bone. You could clean this up. I'd do anything to make you happy. I hope you know that? What if we got another girl to join us? It's about time you... Shut up. Morning. Good morning. Your shoe is untied, detective. What... What happened to her? Oh, please. The alleged killer obviously slashed her throat. Well, this is what we know so far. The victim had high quantities of meth-amphetamine and oxycontin. Hillbilly heroin. Breakfast of champions. No, actually, we're trying to see if she was asphyxiated as well. It looks like she choked on oxycontins, and black beauties, also known as black birds and black bombers. Christ on a cracker. Can this get any worse? Well detectives, if you don't mind, as you see, we have a lot of work to do. We'll let you know of any further details. Thank you, doctor. Excuse me, sir. Do you mind putting your guitar down? Hey, fuckstick? I need you to put the guitar down, right now. Oh yeah? Is that what you need, Boss Hogg? You can get out of here with that shit. I know my rights. We need to talk to your roommate. Is Jonah Paxton here? Look, Lady, I don't know nobody name Jonah. And, even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Alright, now y'all can get out of here. I know you need a warrant. Bitches. Listen, shit for brains. You can either let us in, right fucking now to talk to Jonah, or we'll be back in half hour with a warrant. And at that point, We'll arrange for you to spend some quality time married to the man with the most cigarettes. Or, you can just throw that shit away and point us to Jonah's room. Your choice. Alright, fine. Yeah, I got somebody staying here. I don't know his name, but, er, up the stairs. First door on the right. This is a really safe neighborhood. Jesus. Douchebag. Mr. Paxton. Open the door. We've been given access by your roommate. Mr... Carson? Mr. Carson. So, er, unless you want to spend the rest of your afternoon fixing a broken door, you'll let us in. Can you believe this little shit? Break it down, Hallock. Seen as you have such a hard on for me still, why don't you come on in? Who's your adorable little friend? Look, like I told this hellcat over here, I haven't heard what happened to Kate. Or anything about it. All I did here was where you found the body. So, it seems to me, you're probably sniffing up the wrong tree. We're not here about Kate. We're here to talk to you about another girl. Yeah? What's her name? That's the problem, Jonah. We don't have a name. But we have a face. Real pretty one too, Jonah. Just the way you like them. Yeah. A pretty young blonde, who many witnesses have seen you with, many times. And the same pretty girl was found dead and naked in a dumpster wrapped in plastic trash bags. With a not so pretty cut from ear to ear. Kind of hard to look at, huh, Jonah? No. It's just, I don't recognize her. Hell boy, I don't think her own momma would recognize her. What about this, Jonah? This is an artist's rendering of a hippy blonde girl that they saw you with at the motel, and the bar. Look, Lady, it's like you said. I work at a truck stop bar and motel, right alongside the highway. Right in the middle of the God damn country. Hitchhikers comes through here all of the time. Look like hippies. Hell, they all look the same. So, yeah. I probably bought her a drink. Hell, I probably even fucked her. But... I don't know who you are talking about. So, If you'll excuse me. We'll be back. In the meantime, stay here. James Hallock. Time is 10:42 pm. You know what sucks about this job, Jake? Every time you think you've seen it all, that there's nothing left that can surprise you, somebody comes along and fucking proves you wrong. She's pregnant for Christ's sake. Oh. It's not real. It's not real. Did you forget something, Jonah? Our baby girl? No. But you weren't supposed to be there. I remember all of it. I hope the Bleach eats your soul. You look like hammered shit, Hallock. What have you been up to? What have I been up to? Oh, you know? Trying to solve a murder. Combing over crime scenes. Talking to potential witnesses. Going through stacks and stacks of mug shots. Typing up reports, filing reports, That kind of... Where the fuck have you been? Remember that body you found, down at the river? Yeah. A little hard to forget. She was identified by her grandmother as Valerie Sheppard. Kate's sister and the soon to be mother of Jonah's baby. That is one sick fucking puppy, you know that? Then they sent me to the capitol office. Feds are taking over. Woah, woah, woah. They can't do that. This is our case. They found the body right here. Who gives a shit? That's across the state line. It's out of our jurisdiction. Motherfucker. I had Jonah picked up by a black and white on the way. The Feds won't get here for another couple of hours. That gives us one last chance to get a confession out of him. Let's go princess. I know guys like you. Really, you do? What type of guy am I? Oh. In Elementary school you were the hall monitor. High school you wanted to be class president and quarterback. But you weren't smart or tough enough. But, daddy had a friend on the force. Got you through police academy. Yeah? Yeah. Now you're just the same big dumb pussy hiding behind a badge so you can feel important. Sound about right? Not even close. My turn. In elementary school you were sniffing glue. In high school you were smoking reefer in the bathroom. And you were the one always trying to pick a fight. But when it came down to fighting you'd pull a switchblade. Just to get out of it. Now, you're a drug dealer using your pertty looks just to get by while the rest of us work our ass off to make ends meet. Now, does that sound about right? Hey, beautiful. Got another fresh one here. I figured you more for the blonde cheerleader type. Here you go detective. All yours. Well, hey, Jonah. Thanks for dropping in. Oh looky looky, grandpa and his rookie. How are you doing today, Jonah? Aside from this shitty ass jump suit you got me in for no fucking reason, other than that, if I was any better I'd be twins. Seen your girlfriend Valerie lately? Can't say that I have. Well we have, Jonah. Under the bridge, pregnant and drowned. You don't seem too surprised. Just confess. We got you by the short and curlys. Why draw this out? She was suicidal. She was found partially submerged in inches of water. Pretty hard to kill yourself like that. You're guilty and you're wasting our fucking time. Just confess you little cocksucker. How much time do we have? It still should be another couple of hours. Call the team. Tell them to get here quick. Burt and Ernesto, Morning fellas. Get your feet of the fucking desk, faggot. This is not your house. Anything for you girl. You want to sit here and play games or you want to take it serious. What kind of games you got? Yeah, I got the kind that you might like the best. Tell you what I got. I got pictures, I got fingerprints. I got bodies, I got witnesses. Not to mention footage. Nice. You want to tell me a little bit about these? Huh? What's your opinion? Slut. How do you look at that and have no fucking remorse? It's a bad picture. This motherfucker wants to play games, huh? You know we got tissue samples, we got pictures? We got evidence on the shovel with the fingerprints, man. We got everything we need man, witnesses, and you want to sit here and fuck around with me? Is that what you want to do? Oh. Sir, can I get you to sign in? You know my name. Sir, sir? Parties over ladies. The party just started, man. Did they read you your rights? No. How about down at muddy river? No. Well. Then don't say another word. Even if your dick's on fire. Wait. Who the fuck are you? Oh. I'm your beacon of light. Gus Marlowe. Attorney at law. Here to represent my client, Jonah Paxton. Who has been illegally detained without arrest, warrant or Miranda. You might turn off that tape now. Let me make something clear to you. I don't know what rock you crawled from under, but we got photographs, fingerprints witnesses, hair samples, tissue samples Your so called, "client", he has no rights. You don't have shit. Dicks down in Hicksville didn't read him his rights. And did you even ask? I think not. You prints are worthless. I'm sorry, I don't care if the Virgin Mary accuses him of murder. No warrant. No Hold. Why you representing this dumb fuck? He's a nobody. I'm not a nobody. That's quite enough. If you could see the beautiful things I've done. Yeah? Like what? Share it. I'd like to speak to my client alone. Ok. Let you guys have your moment. Let me tell you something, man. You got no chance in court. And you? Your ass is mine. Believe that. And you better wipe that smile off your face. Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you. You've got to be the stupidest son of a bitch this side of the Rockies. I did it. I cleaned it up. Something's happening I can't explain. I see them. You took a lie detector test without a lawyer. I passed, didn't I? You cocky son of a bitch. El Jefe will be proud. I put my soul in to that beautiful piece of artwork. El Jefe doesn't want to see your putrid little face anywhere near him. Your lucky he still wants the tape, or I'd be talking to a mound of dirt. I can't explain it. I keep seeing them. I... It's the blood. I need to clean. No. Forget cleaning. Go here. Alejandro's. Bring the tape. You get your money. I suggest you take the next flight. Become a ghost. You are a dirty, pathetic, little boy. You can just simply wake up. You could clean this up. Make your escape. These detectives, they know what I did, they hunt me every waking moment. and when I'm not awake I've got these girls that are constantly torturing me. I don't know what to do. Yes you do. Become, Jonah. Don't let them catch you. Embrace the foul frame. Become the demon you were born to be. Clean it up and be the monster I need. Be the soldier at my side. We must shed your weak skin. Burn it off you. And you will be reborn. I need you to get over here. I'll take care of everything. I would ask you if you've gone crazy, but, apparently, that's a redundant question. First of all, I am going to skip this whole bleach thing, and ask the question that involves me. Why haven't you turned in that tape yet? Huh? The tape. Our money. A very angry El Jefe, my connection. Come on. Put some clothes on. I'll take you now. I burnt them all up when I was cleaning. How do I look? You look ready. Ready for what? Like I told you over the phone, I'll take care of everything. Now let's get going. You've got to see this. What you are looking at is not Jonah Paxton. I've got it. Can we get this ball rolling? You're a pathetic little boy. Look at you. Standing there in your panties. I'm not pathetic. I'm in charge. And they're not panties. They're underwear, you euro trash. And they're clean. Everything's clean. From the inside out. They're going to kill you. They're going to kill you, Jonah. Nah. He's not going to kill me. I've got his precious little film. Just get the tape, and... we'll... get the tape and let's get this over with. You want a nightcap? Sure. Why not? I don't know what this is going to do to your precious little movie, but, by the looks of it, it isn't going to be pretty. Everyone drop your weapons. Now. Jonah, Betty, slowly walk backwards to us. What you are looking at is not Jonah Paxton. Jonah Paxton is dead. I'm the ghost of Jonah Paxton. Soon to be a brand new creature. A new entity in fact. This is not a confession. But a story of victory. I have battled the demons and their chance to stop my mission, but was victorious. I've controlled the torture of these three ghost bitches, and these detectives. By the time you see this video, I will be long gone. In a new place. A new dimension. But I want the world to know about the masterpiece that I have created. Enjoy.
