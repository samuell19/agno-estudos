Sachin Tendulkar is the king of cricket. Abdul Kalam is known for the rockets. And when it comes to football, Mahendra Singh… I am not sure about that. But the only person who can be the minister of this constituency is our leader. With a good margin of votes people have finally found their leader. This victory has been-- Our leader is the permanent minister of this constituency. With around 1,00,000 plus votes, Mr. Krishna has won the election. I am not a leader. I consider myself as your servant. -Yes! -Yes! Sir! Yes! Congratulations, sir. Who's that young girl with the kid? Sir, they are from Aadharana Foundation. -That kid is about to die in a week. -Oh. He saw you at the ashram during your birthday celebration. Sir! Since then he wanted to meet you. That's why I called him. Alright! Bring them in. Let them in. -Hey, come here. -Okay. -Greetings, sir. -Oh! You look great! I gave you a kiss. What will you give me in return? Oh! -Yes! -Yes! Oh, come on. Will you have some chocolates? Bring those chocolates! Here you go, sir. Have it. Five-star chocolates. I gave you chocolates. Now what are you going to give me? Do you have chocolates for me? Sir! PARTY OF THE CURRENT GENERATION Sir! Please get up father. What happened? Sir! Sir! How did this happen to you? God! Father! Our minister is no more! KRISHNA WADIYAR Killing him was not our plan. Right? Right. But I got this idea while watching Athadu this morning. Killing him is the simpler thing to do. How is this meme? It's not a big deal if you just want to see the gun. But if you wish to see the bullet… you will meet death! What if something happens to that kid? Your careless attitude makes you take such stupid decisions. It's gonna land us in trouble one day! My attitude? If you run an RT-PCR test on my attitude the result will always be positive. What about the kid? Nobody can do anything to him. He has already gone through so much. He was kidnapped and sold at the age of six. He was tortured heavily and thrown away when he was out of his mind. And months later, he was diagnosed with a rare heart disease. He just has some days in hand. He cannot say anything about us. This isn't wrong, Vikram. What if they file a case against him? He is… fifteen years and seven months old. He can't be sent to prison. And according to the juvenile law, he will be sent to a juvenile school. We are done with one guy. Next! Ram Shetty! What do we know about him? A well-known businessman with sound political influence. He was just a goon fifteen years ago. His kidnaps and murders raised his political nexus. From the stage of working for politicians, he rose to a stage where the politicians work for him now. Among all his businesses, the most important one is child trafficking. To the world, he is a businessman who exports textiles. But he earns the most by exporting children illegally. He lives in Bangalore but he operates crime beyond South India. Everyone knows that he is a crime lord. But he was arrested only once. He was in police station for just half an hour. In next two weeks, he is about to do a big child trafficking operation around Mumbai. The whole of India should watch his crime live on TV. Live? Arrest, influence, bail… is like a habit to him. Arresting him should not be just news. It should become a sensation. Only then, politicians cannot support him. Fine! Myself, you and Satish. It's just the three of us. How are we going to do this? Aren't three of us enough… to get a guy arrested? BEST WISHES TO NATIONAL SCIENCE OLYMPIAD WINNER, RAKESH G ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF VADAMALAPETA COURAGE IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS Hey! NA ISHTAM -Good morning, sir. -Good morning, sir. Good morning. Sit down. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you, sir. Sarada, give me that book. I told you all to learn the name of the scientists for today's class. Did you learn them? -Yes, we did, sir. -Yes, we did, sir. Good! -Hey, did you study? -Let's start. We'll start with our Physics Olympiad winner, Rakesh. Come on my boy. -Einstein, sir. -Very good. You are the Einstein of our village. Next. Newton, sir. -Galileo, sir. -Please. Tell me. -I won't tell you. -Please. Please, Sreenu. -Just help me out. -What did you sing about me that day? -It was… -Abdul Kalam. "Sreenu, Sreenu, cigarette! Sreenu's wife is biscuit!" That's why I won't help you! Graham Bell, sir. Nicholas, sir. -Michael Faraday, sir. -Please help me. -Please, Sreenu. -Tesla, sir. -James D, sir. -Please, sir. -Paramjit Khurana, sir. -Good. -Yellapragada Subbarow, sir. -Vaseekaran, sir. My grandma, sir. -M. S. Swaminathan-- -Wait! What name did you say? You! Say that name. Vaseekaran, sir. Who is Vaseekaran? Sir, actually Vaseekaran is a scientist in the film Robot. I will get back to you. Hello. What did you say? My grandma, sir. Silence! Madam Curie? No, sir. It's my grandmother. -Your grandmother? -Yes! What is your grandmother's invention? An air blowing pipe, sir. She blows air into it. That's what I am talking about. That's exactly the way. You are right, sir. -Standup on the bench. -Sir. Get up now! Sir, my grandmother keeps saying that she is the one who invented that pipe. Shut up! You will stand on the bench for the entire session -and you will stand for the entire day. -Sir. Sir, please! Sir! Hey! Stand up, Vasi. Come on. No, sir. That is not the right way to say it. You must say, "Vasi, come on. Get up." That's how you should say it, sir. He is Raghupathi. They say that "madness can be of different types but he is mad about only one thing. Varma. Ram Gopal Varma. And that too to such an extent that only 356 people saw Lakshmi's NTR in the entire India. He is one among them. His dream is to become a big filmmaker. Done with your bath? Pray to the God before leaving. Of course, Mom! I pray to God everyday! Lord Ram, Lord Vinayaka, Lord Srinivasa, Lord Jagannatha, Lord Shiva. All in all he is like a Ram Gopal Varma's tweet. We think that we've got it, but we actually haven't. Thank you, sir. You monkey, mind your own business. -Hellboy! -I will fall down, buffalo! Hey, Raghupathi. Do you just keep roaming around or have you learnt the alphabets as well? I've learnt them. A-B-C-D-F… your grandfather's butt is tough! You rascal. You deserve one tight slap! Hey, where is Raghava? Where else he will be at this hour? When did India win its first World Cup in cricket? A, 1882. B, 1883. C, 1982. D, 1983. I think it's 1882. No, dear. It's 1883. Both of you got it wrong. It's 1982. Meet this guy, who gives wrong answers to any question without second thought. He is Raghava. He gives wrong answer confidently to any question. Frankly, he is better than his parents. As per their answers, there were no one-day matches in cricket. And the fact is, these guys are watching the repeat episode of the program. You would have estimated their IQ levels by now. They would never find out that the right answer is 1983. Raghava is quite sure that the answer is 1982. And his parents completely believe that their son is a genius. He is a fifth class dropout, by choice. He believes that he has gained enough knowledge by then. His dream is to participate in Who wants to be a millionaire show and win one crore. Forget about the one crore. A middle-class family can easily pay their phone bills for ten years with the money they spent on sending SMS's to the show. Raghava is like the spelling of the "puncture" shop. The spelling is never written correctly at any place. Never ever. Never ever. -Got the camera? -Yes, I did. -Here it is! -Okay. Mom! -Yes. -Come here. Dad! -What are you doing? -What happened? Come here. We might get a call from the show any moment. That's why, we are making this video. Alright? Yes. I am coming. Yeah, I'm ready. You all walk from inside and stop right in front of the camera. -Okay? -Okay. They will run this video when I get on the hot seat. -So, give your best. -Action! Hi, everyone! I am Raghava. That's my mom and that's my dad. We are from Vadamalapeta, a village near Tirupati. My father has three acres of land. We also have four oxen and three buffaloes. But due to the recent floods, our entire crop washed out. Right before the harvest… Cut! Aunt, didn't I tell you to cry to these lines? Sorry, I forgot. Fine. Remember! Shed exactly two tear drops from your left eye. -Okay? -Don't miss it. -Okay? -Again from the beginning? Yes. Ready? Action! We are from Vadamalapeta, a village near Tirupati. My father has three acres of land. We also have four oxen and three buffaloes. But due to the recent floods our entire crop washed out. Right before the harvest… Why is she overacting? If I win one crore rupees I will adopt my village and will make it better. Also, I will buy my parents a car. Everybody writes "Dad's gift" or "Mom's gift" on their cars. But I want to see my parent's car with "Son's gift" on it. Mom and Dad, come and kiss me. Cut! That's enough. Go now! Is it done? Yes! You were awesome! But, we need to shoot other things as well. Other things? Our lands are dried up as we have no water for irrigation. The butts of kids dried up as there is no water to wash them. Suri, who should be studying at school, is singing songs with his buffaloes. Our old women are struggling to breathe while gossiping. I should take them to hospital. The pots of our women should be filled with water. And their hearts should be filled with me. I want to build a school, a tank and a hospital. Roads should be laid. A lot needs to be done. I will change everything and become the father of my village. And for this, I need money. All the best, Raghava. All the best, Raghava. All the best, Raghava. All the best, Raghava. All the best, Raghava. -All the best, Raghava. -All the best, Raghava. Wow! You are such a performer! You are a great director. We have a great connection. There comes a day when our Raghava will reach up to Rakesh! Did Raghava make this video? -Really? -Let's go. Idiots! Is there anything else you do other than roaming around? Did you give up on your studies? Shameless brats! What are you looking at? I am telling you! We shall dance at her funeral. There is one more idiot in this village along with these two. Here comes Rajaram. The fastest bowler of India. Well, that's his dream. But he maintains an attitude as if he is the fastest bowler of India. Bro, move to the first slip. This is first slip. And that is second slip. Do you know where you are standing? One and a half slip. Move a little. Little. There! That's it. Balu, go to deep mid-wicket. Dileep, go to gully. Oh, Lord! Brother, a bit to your right. Hey! He is the batsman. -He is covering the wicket. -Hey! Is this enough? Little more. Yeah. That's a six! -No ball. -No ball? That's cheating. -It's not fair. -Let's go and check. -Hey. -I'm sure he crossed the crease. Let's see. Hey, the crease is in Vadamalapeta and your foot is in Tirupati. That's the worst bowling ever! Poor guy! He can't get a grip of the ball as his hands are tiny. Everybody in the village has hit him for a six. Six! Six! Yes! I lost my money. That was an easy catch at deep mid-wicket. Enough of your bowling. You go beyond deep midwicket and sit on the bench. Go! Get lost and never come back. He is a huge fan of "Malinga". And decided to become like him. In this process, he even got a haircut like Malinga. And his mother thrashed badly. Don't get deceived by his use of English words. He knows only the English words used in cricket. Do you want to know his education? Harsha Bhogle is his Maths teacher. Sunil Gavaskar is his science teacher. Cricket is his syllabus. And playground is his school. The only important thing other than cricket in his life, is a police toy gifted by his uncle. Look at what he does with it. The only common goal they have is… to become famous. The only common enemy they have is… Rakesh! Damn it! What happened? Our teachers are just talking about Rakesh. It's killing me. It seems Physics Olympiad is full of tough questions. Those questions are really easy. Can he answer the questions of MEK like me? He just cannot. Yes, Raghava. If he's that smart, ask him to make a movie like me. He can't. Ask him to bowl fast like Rajaram. Impossible! Friends, for me to become a filmmaker, for you to become a fast bowler and for you to become a millionaire, and to us to becoming famous is very difficult until we are in this village. True. You know how terrible it is to play cricket with these village guys. They don't even tamper the ball when it's given to a fast bowler. What happens when you tamper the ball? It… The ball will skid. And the batsman won't be able to judge it. Really? If I were in Hyderabad, I would have won one crore by now. Yes, Raghava. We must go to Hyderabad. Let's go. Let's go and stay there. We shall become famous. So famous that our photos are all over the newspapers. -Yes, we should. -Let's go. -Hyderabad? -No! Home. My mother should be home by now. If I am not home, she will beat me up. Idiot! But we do need lot of money to go to Hyderabad. How will we get that money? Kids, come and work with me! I will give you ten rupees. Ten rupees is not enough for us old man. How much do you need? We need crores of money. Try sleeping under a tree and maybe you will have a dream about money. Old man, your jokes are three generations old. Really? How are you going to make the money? Let's hatch a plan And have the village in chaos Before they realize Let's sell the village This isn't a funny business We can sell the world to get what we want Listen to the plans You will know that we are serious -Plan A! -Let's sell the school -Plan B -Let's loan the river -Plan C -Let's tell stories -Oh! -And win trust After listening Everyone starts giving us money When our box is full We shall flee together Let's hatch a plan And have the village in chaos Let's hunt for the gold Let's bargain and close the deals Let's get on the road of earning money Raghava, I need your help with the English language. This board is not attracting any customers. That's why I got Jackie Chan's picture painted along with that of Allu Arjun's. How are the paintings? Aren't they awesome? Oh! Okay, make a note. Yes, tell me. B-A-R-B-A-R. Bar-Bar. S-H-O-P. Shop. Well said! Note it down. -Who's this? Rajnikanth or Suman? -Don't make mistakes. Who is that? -Brother. -Yes. Why don't you include children's haircut as well? You will also have family audience coming to you. Yes! You are right! Raghava, tell that as well. Alright, write it. Super Barbar Shop. This is cool. Now the shop looks amazing! Doesn't it look great? Great job, Raghava. Raghava, you are the pride of our village. -Superb! -Okay, fine. VADAMALAPETA Small amounts are not good enough to chill Ignoring physical tiredness We will do our best And when the luck is on our side We will be a big hit Then all villagers will become Our income sources Listen to us There are plans for sale Let's hatch a plan And have the village in chaos There are many disguises of money Our destiny to rule, inspires our speed. Let's make the world witness it once Control room, check. Come, Satish. What's the update on Ram Shetty's Mumbai Operation? Our informer joined their gang. He is giving regular updates. Anything on the number of children with them? Around 30 kids. Where is the file? How are you coming? I will be flying to Mumbai tomorrow evening. I have informed the press and the TV channels. -I will take care of the formalities. -Ram Shetty? He will start a day before the operation. His flight from Bangalore is at 6:45 p.m. How about you? Vikram and I will reach on the same day. We will come by road. Satish, all set, right? Prominent industrialist, Ram Shetty paid his final respects to the late minister, Krishna Wadiyar Swamy. He expressed his deep condolences for the loss. He reminisced about the friendship between them. …in prison of Nepal has deteriorated. Charlie Shobraj is highly intelligent and has been known to make women fall in love with him and then-- Mom. I am hungry. It will take five more minutes. Raghu, what's all this? How many times should I tell you? Why do you cut the alphabets of your name from the newspaper? -That is yesterday's paper, Dad. -So? How can we sell these papers to scrap now? Why do you always do this? He learns them from his mother. Mom, hurry up. I am hungry. Five minutes, darling! Dawood Ibrahim has been India's most wanted criminal for the past 25 years. A common man, rose to the heights of an underworld don. Dawood has always-- Dad. Who is he? He is Dawood Ibrahim, a most wanted criminal. What did he do? He is the one held responsible for the Bombay blasts. Was he not caught? No, son. The one who catches him will get 50 lakh rupees as prize money and yet, no one could catch him. What did you say the prize money is? 50 lakh rupees. -Have some dosa. -Wait for five minutes. Is he Dawood Ibrahim? All these days I have assumed it to be Ram Gopal Varma's photo. STONE SHOP Thank you, sir. -What happened? -Wait, I'll tell you. She used to sit in the veranda and scold every passerby. Raja, I need to talk something important! Wait! I will get him bowled! Six! -He will come now. -What is it? I've got a great idea to make some money. Who is he? He is Dawood Ibrahim. Is he going to give us the money? -No! He is a terrorist. -So? He is the one behind Bombay blasts. If we can catch him, we'll win 50,00,000 rupees. -Really? -Yes. Not one crore rupees? Stop it, idiot! How much money is that? That's a lot of money! Rajamouli can make the third part of Baahubali with that kind of money. That's a lot of money. Where can we find him? He is responsible for the Bombay blasts, so I am supposing he should be in Bombay. How can we catch him if he is in Bombay? Right. What is going on with him? Why is he talking about money, Dawood and Bombay? Just stay calm. Say something! What is the plan? We will catch Dawood Ibrahim! We are going to Bombay to find out where Dawood lives. We will hand him over to the police. Bombay? How do we go to Bombay? How long will we stay there? How much money would we need? We will figure out all of that today. -Yes! -Yes! One more thing. No one must know that we three are after Dawood. This stays between us. Do you swear? -Mother's promise! -Mother's promise! From now on, we will never use the name Dawood Ibrahim. We need to give this mission a name. Raghava? What's the spelling of "mission"? Write it down. M-I… M-I-S… It's M-I-S-H-A-N. What shall we name it? First we need to know how far Bombay is from here. How? My father used to own a book store. I should be able to find an old world map. Let's get it. Come on! Why do you need a map? I'll show you. Yes, Ravi. The connecting flight is from Bombay. -Bombay? -Bombay? There is a seven-hour wait during the transit. -Seven hours? -Yes. It's a 28-hour flight to the U.S. What's the price of the ticket? -Ticket? 600 rupees, bro. -Yes. -600, bro? -600 dollars? -That's quite cheap. -What does "bro" mean? It's nothing. We have rupee here. And they have "bro" in America. We address money in the form of rupees. In America, they call it "bro". It is… Bro is the USA's currency. Really? I can't find Bombay on the map. It must be here somewhere. Let's share the task. You search from this end and I'll search from that end. Raja, you may search in this blue area. -Alright. -Bombay… Buddies, Bombay is here. We are in Andhra Pradesh. Let's search for Andhra Pradesh. But we are in Vadamalapeta, right? Vadamalapeta won't be on the map. -Yes! -Oh! Is Bombay bigger than Vadamalapeta? Bombay is as big as Tirupati. -So… -Here is Andhra Pradesh. -Okay. -U.S… Here it is! -Why are you looking for the U.S.? -I'll explain it to you. Raja, get me the scale. It's around 28 centimeters from here. Remember what that guy was speaking over the phone? He said it takes 28 hours to go to the U.S.? Right? The U.S. is 28 centimeters away from Andhra Pradesh on the map. That is why it took 28 hours. The distance from Andhra Pradesh to Bombay on map is four centimeters. So, it is four hours away. -It's not that far. -Yes. It's nearby. So, it will take four hours to reach Bombay. Come, let's go to Tirupati now. Why? We need to find out the price of tickets and the lodging expenses in Bombay. We have to find out the details today. When we are in Bombay, let's meet Sachin Tendulkar. Please. We can meet him if we have time. Alright. Guys, Goddess Gangamma Festival has started in Tirupati. -Shall we go there? -If I don't get back home on time, my mother will sacrifice me to the Goddess. Brother, turn up the volume. We can't hear the song. TIRUPATI, SEVEN KILOMETERS What is this? It's only been a week. -Are you missing me already? -Sir, Kurnool. I told you that I would come by next weekend. -Come soon. -I will visit for sure. -Hurry up and take it. -I will get you chocolates. Miss you, darling. Are you missing me? I promised you that I will visit you. Where do you want to go? -Nellore, sir. -200 rupees! Did I ever break the promise? I will take a leave on Sunday and visit you. -Okay. -What shall we do? Shall we go for a long drive to get coffee or to Chandragiri fort? Come on, tell me. -Where do you want to go? -To Hyderabad. -500 rupees! -I want an ice cream. Do you want an ice cream? You can have as many ice creams as you wish. Did I ever stop you? You are the best! Bombay. -900 rupees. -Come, let's go. Will you take me to Mahesh Babu's film? A movie? Sure! Let's watch the film you like. Did I ever say no to you? What is this? I need a ticket to Rajahmundry. Why did you give me a ticket to Mumbai? Wait a minute, sweetheart. What happened? TRAVELING WITHOUT A TICKET IS A LEGAL OFFENSE Where is guy who asked me for a Bombay ticket? -Where do you think he is? -How will I know? Ask your sweetheart. She will tell you. Don't you dare talk about my sweetheart. I'll break your head. Where are these guys? Hey! Where are you guys? I've already punched the ticket. Where are you? This is the final cost. This means, I have to pay the money now. Why are we wearing these monkey caps? There are CCTV cameras inside. Everyone will come to know that we inquired about rooms. Then they will come to know about out mission. Okay. -You don't-- -Let's go. You can go. I did my part at the bus stand. It's your turn now. Why don't you go? Please. You guys go this time. -I won't go. -Please. Let's try out options. Alright, fine. Damn it! This isn't going to help us decide. Let's go together. Alright. Let's go. Police! This is the log book, sir. The entries show the names of people who have booked a room here. What do we do now? I don't know. Let's hide here and know the price. I need a room for a day. 800 rupees. What is that? "Aattu sau?" How much is that? A little. How much is "a little"? It definitely is something. That is why I asked you to learn Hindi. What do we do now? What do we do now? Wait a minute. Sir! -Are you looking for a room? -Yes. Please come to our lodge, sir. You will get a room for 200 rupees. Here is 200 rupees. I need a room. The room is for 800 rupees and not 200 rupees. Are you kidding? -It's your boy who told me that. -Our hotel boy? -Did you tell him? -Hey. So, if the charge is 800 rupees per day then five days in Bombay will cost us… It's 800 rupees in Tirupati. Will it be same in Bombay? The cost of a Lifebuoy soap is same in Tirupati or Bombay. The same is the case with the room. -It would be the same. -Really? -Sir, it's those idiots. -Hey! -Run! -Who are you? How much will it cost for the three of us? One room is enough for the three of us? Right? Yes, that's true. I just got confused. Brother, what do you people have for breakfast? Vada pav, pav bhaji. For lunch? Same. And for dinner? This is what we have the entire day. Do you have the same at night as well? Does the entire Bombay survive on vada pav and pav bhaji? Alright! Let's go. Don't you want vada pav? No, bro. What's with the bun? Looks like a sick man's staple food. Give it to him. -He is ready to eat. -Want some? We need 10,000 rupees to go to Bombay. How much? 10,000 rupees What about the return expenses? They will give us 50,00,000 rupees, right? Yes, that's true. Well, there is one more thing. Starting from tomorrow, we need to learn Hindi in three days. I think everyone in Bombay speaks Hindi. How do we learn it? What? Hindi? In three days? In three days? In three days? Hindi in three days? Who are you? Could you please teach us Hindi in three days? In three days? You don't have to teach us everything. Help us speak Hindi fluently. We already know a little Hindi. What do you know? Tell me. It's an overpitched ball. It was an amazing hit. The ball has been hit in the gully and… the fielder gets it. It's not gully, sir. I meant the air. It's not pakoda but pakada. You tell me. Let's play. Rangeela. Kaun. Bhoot. Sarkar One. Sarkar Two. -What else? -Shiva 2006. Aag. Rakht Charitra. Daud. Stop it! Teaching Hindi to you guys is impossible in three days. It will take a minimum of 30 days. Sir! Please, sir! Please! Alright! Let me know your names first. Raghupathi. Raghava. Rajaram. Team RRR, sir! I really like your names. I will teach you Hindi only for the sake of your names. -Alright, sir! -Alright, sir! We need to start our physical training from tomorrow onwards. Why do we need training? Do you think it would be easy to catch Dawood? There might be chases and fights as well. We may have to use all our intelligence. Can we do all these without practicing? It's not funny business. How long should we get trained for? If my mother knows about this, she is going to strip me off and beat the shit out of me. Tell her that you are at a friend's place. My mother knows that you two are the only friends I have. I have a plan to handle this. We'll be going to a friend's place who doesn't exist. As he doesn't exist, there's no chance of we getting caught. In that case, what is the name of our new friend? Name? Name-- MASTAN REDDY Yes! Mastan Reddy! Hey! Wait. Where were you so late? I was at Mastan Reddy's place. I was playing with him. Who is Mastan Reddy? A new friend. You haven't met him. Fine. Freshen up and eat. Come, let's go Come, let's achieve Come let's see the end Come, let's believe Come, let's show Come, you come on Don't look around Don't forget about the medal Let's show our power Come on, move ahead When even an ant aims at A snake too would be dead When war calls, we challenge it Don't fear even after this Let anyone block the way, move ahead Come saying you're ready If a honey bee bites Even an elephant is gone Whatever it may be, pierce the thorn Size doesn't matter, burn like the fire Even if down at every step Even if down at every step Hero wins in the climax Don't fear to an invisible villain You come on, move ahead By moving the pawns at pace Buddy, is that Dawood Ibrahim? Hey, that's Akshay Kumar. Our training is about to get completed. What's our plan to catch Dawood? Plan Trivikram. PLAN TRIVIKRAM Way to Dawood's home! Firstly, we need to win Dawood aunt's heart. Then save his uncle's life. Dawood's family members should become fond of us. And then, we should get a lead to Dawood. It's difficult to breach all the boundaries and do all this. Plan Rajamouli. It will take two years for planning. After all that planning, we can still not be sure if Dawood can be nabbed or not. We all should be born again and Dawood should be born again and then-- Easy! Please stop. Plan Sukumar. -Let's not think about it. -Just say it. It will be complicated. a²+b² + (a+b)². It will Sin and Theta as well. Then, what's our plan? Plan Puri Jagannath. Go to Bombay, catch Dawood, get him arrested, and rule the world. How are we going to make the money? Mastan Reddy will do it for us. If we don't act now Our pockets will be empty Even by cheating as many Or even by working hard Let's collect and save some money If questioned about size Let's dash ahead and show our power Bullet size is small But it gets deep into a human body When even an ant aims at A snake too would be dead When war calls, we challenge it Everybody gets bored when people say that the reason behind their success are their parents. I with all respect state the fact that we are also one among those people. Hey! That's not respect. -It's pride. -I forgot! I am proud of it. Instead of whining about what the country has done for you, you also should think about what you did for the country. -Jai Hind! -Hey. -How is it? -What is this? After we catch Dawood, TV people will place their mikes for us to speak. I am practicing the victory speech. Though it is not so easy There's a way, dear Even a hill fits into a mirror Like the typical hero of Puri's film Don't go back and jump ahead Let's show our power Even if a don is there Where are you going? I am going to Mastan Reddy's place. Why? Today is his birthday. I will be back before 7:00 p.m. Okay. Wait a minute. Will you go empty-handed to a birthday party? Take this. Convey my birthday wishes to him. Take care. What happened to you? You were never like this. Be safe and be home soon. Okay! Go. Grandpa… have your medicines on time. Don't smoke too much. Take care of your health. See you soon. Why hasn't he come yet? I don't know where he is. There he is! Why did you get such a big bag? How will we carry 50,00,000 rupees? -We need a bag, right? -Hey. Leave all that. I feel scared. Let's just go home. If we don't take risks, only rusks will be left in our lives. Stop your filmy dialogues! Okay, fine. Put all your things in this. Okay! Look, someone is coming. Don't get scared and stand aside. Come only when I call you guys, okay? -Brother. -Hey. -Brother. -What is he doing? I hope the plan works. Guys, come. He stopped the bike. Come on! -Come on. -Let's go. -I am getting on. Just wait. -Come on. Move ahead. -You-- -Hey, Raghava! -Brother, I am sorry. -What are you doing? -Please, brother. -Move ahead. Where are you going, Uncle? To get a haircut? -Want some water? -No! Where is Raghu? He is at Mastan Reddy's place, for a birthday party. He would return by 7:00 p.m. Mastan Reddy? You don't know him. He is a new friend he made. He even came to our home a few times. What are you staring at? Go get my coffee. Sure. Hello, Satish? Everything is ready, Shailaja. Our informer is giving us regular updates. Okay! Press? I have informed to all the channels. Be careful, Satish. Even a small mistake can cost us a lot. You guys be careful. Bombay! Come on. Bombay! -Guys, let's go. -Let's go, guys. My god! Guys, just step down. What happened? Our Hindi teacher is in the bus. What do we do now? I don't know! Should we board the bus at the town outskirts? But they will charge us more. That's okay. We can skip our meeting with Sachin. That will save us some money. -Alright, let's go. -Let's go. -He is not home yet? -No! Did he tell you where Mastan Reddy's house is? -No. -You don't know anything, idiot! It's 8:00 p.m. already! And you don't know where your son is? Shame on you! Come, let's search for him. Our parents would be searching for us by now. Don't be scared. The bus is here. Pune! Where is Pune? It is Kerala's capital. It's quite far. Brother, come in. Is your son here? No, brother. He isn't home yet. I searched the entire village. Couldn't find him anywhere. I am scared about it. Rajaram isn't home as well. No. He isn't back yet. Do you know Raghava's house? -Yes. -Let's go. Buddy, another bus is coming. Mumbai! Mumbai! What's your seat number? What's your seat number, sir? -Hey. -Come in. I can see all buses except the one to Mumbai. Right! He must be home by now. -Laxman, hold on. -Yes, brother. -Did my son come to your place? -No, brother. Didn't your son come back home either? We've been looking for my son. The three of them are missing. Who is Mastan Reddy? -Don't worry. -I wonder where my son is. He cannot stand hunger. Find out what happened. He wasn't home. What are you doing? Just ask. -He knows nothing but school and-- -Wait a minute. Calm down, dear. Nothing wrong will happen. IN MEMORY OF MASTAN REDDY Let's just go home. I am scared. We shouldn't give up after coming this far. -Subramaniam. -Tell me. My son and his two friends are missing from evening. Your son is missing? -Did you check in the village? -Yes, I did. -Brother, I am warning you. -Okay. You will be responsible if my son goes missing. Please stay calm. I am talking for three of them. Please be patient. He is dealing with it, right? Just be patient. I will search Tirupati bus stand and railway station. Don't worry. Why will you check those places? They must be somewhere nearby. I'll take care of it. You don't worry. Sir, have you seen three kids around? No, sir. -Did you search all the buses? -Sir, they are not here. The kids aren't at the bus stand and railway station. Where could they be? I am on the highway, sir. I'll reach Bombay by tomorrow morning. -Goods are all loaded, sir. -Hey. -What if we get into the truck? -Yes, sir. I'll come there. Alright, sir. -The kids are not at the railway station. -What? We are going to highway to check the buses. We'll check and call. -We are also coming there. -Alright. -Where are you going? -Bangalore. Okay, right. -Hey. -Stop. -The police are here. -Why are you taking the wrong route? -Are you drunk? -No, sir. -Happened to see three kids? -No, sir! -You didn't? -No, sir! If you happen to see them, inform in nearest police station. -Alright, sir. -Move the vehicle now. Alright, sir! Yes, Subramaniam. They are not here as well. Send me their pictures. I will forward them to all the nearest police stations. What happened? They are not there! Damn it! Yeah Satish, tell me! I've been trying to reach you from half an hour. I couldn't connect, Shailaja. What is it Satish? Ram Shetty didn't board the Mumbai flight from Bangalore. He is going to Mangalore tomorrow. What? Yes! That's not all of it . An hour ago, a flight from Singapore landed in Mangalore. Five Dubai citizens were spotted. They looked suspicious but managed to clear immigration. This is all the information I had from the Airport Officer. What about our informer? Satish? Satish, what happened to our informer Satish? I think he is caught. There's no response from him for an hour. Ram Shetty leaves to Mangalore. Five guys from Dubai have landed in Mangalore. Mumbai is a deviation, Satish. This operation is taking place in Mangalore. -What? Mangalore? -Yeah. Are you sure Shailaja? Goodness! Are we really in Bombay? Let's ask him. Brother, what is this place? Bengaluru! We reached Bengaluru instead of Bombay. But that truck was meant to reach Bombay, right? Why are we in Bengaluru? I too don't have a clue. Bombay is the old name guys. Recently this city was renamed as Bengaluru. That's all! Let's start our mission. Their confidence is contagious Their energy is enormous These hobbits cannot be Taken for granted Together they form The world's tiniest atomic package Brace yourself to witness These deer chasing their lion We have to rent a room first. Why do we have to rent a room? If we can get Dawood arrested by evening, we can catch the 10:00 p.m. bus. When we get Dawood arrested, we will be on TV. Right? For sure. We will look so bad with dirty clothes on TV. No, we won't. No, we shouldn't. Then what should we do? We should never take a bath at a dirty place as this. Until we finish the mission, we need to take care of our health. What is it? For what? What? Should we pay for having a bath? You know what? My mother pays me if I take a bath. How much? Five rupees for using toilet and five rupees for bathroom. One, two and three, 30 rupees. Here's twenty-five. -I didn't take dump. -Nonsense! Keep the toilets clean! I am missing my mother. He is hungry. But he does not know how to say it. That's when he feels like he is missing his mother. Do you have vada pav? Oh, I forgot. Brother, do you have vada pav? It's not the language but the item that I did not understand. What is vada pav? Guys, come here with me. They are speaking Telugu in Bombay! Knowledge-less boy! Earlier, Bombay was in Andhra Pradesh. When the states got separated Hyderabad was given to Telangana. And Bombay was given to these people. -Oh! -Oh! Sir. Do you know where this person is? I have never seen him around. Who is he? He is my uncle. He had a big fight with my aunt and left the village. Aunt has been crying for days now. She's not even eating. Oh, that's sad! Do let us know if you see him around. I will be back soon. Did luck come And knock your doors repeatedly Did the lights come on And glow in your small minds? You have packed everything And are in a city where you are nothing You have chosen a never-ending path How will you know How far you have to walk? Don't your tired feet Make you give up? Can't you see the truth? These roads are new for you Yet you have no fear This is a maze you don't understand Why enter it When you don't know a way out? This is the plan of three idiots No math can measure their foolishness Is the wake-up call coming soon? In a great confusion The three seem to be stuck Your dream is all messed up! Let's ask him. -Sir! -Sir! Can you please take us to this guy? Are you playing a prank on me? Where are the cameras? Show them. -I have seen a lot of such foolish stuff. -What is he saying? How many more are you going to make? You will make such videos and as soon as we walk away, you add graphics and call us fools. That's all you do, right? No, I am not a fool! -You are the fool! -Fool? -What's with him? -Hello, fool! Fool! It's fun to know the truth Think about it Why are you wasting time On an impossible mission? Why won't you give up on your silly goal? You are spreading the fishing net On a pond with no fish Is there no one Who can make you see sense? Hey! -Hey, leave me! -I will not! -Hey! -Hey! Hey, look at that. He will not come to you again. 4,000 rupees, please. Those guys are taking money to do things. Come, let's talk to them. Brother! Big Brother! Small Brother! Do you know where this guy is? You don't have to do it for free. We will pay you. It will cost 2,000 rupees. Wait a minute. Here it is. I have watched in many RGV movies. Villains reside in places like these. Brother. Idiots! What are you up to? Are you riding a bike? You are firing bullets. -Come here. -What? We have got a deal. You should do a role. We are in the middle of an important drama. Next, we have the Salt March episode. I am playing Gandhi in it. It's urgent! Ask someone else to play the part. Send her instead. She is Jhansi Rani. She died way before the Salt March. Send him then. He is not a 12th man in cricket who can substitute me. Hey, Rutherford! How much are they paying you? 600 rupees. What about you? I get 400 rupees plus tea, biscuit… and a samosa after the play! Brother. Yes? You brought independence to the country, and you are paid just 400 for it? And the Britisher is receiving 600 rupees? I wonder if our country is really independent! Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi said about independence? -Stop! How much? -1,500 rupees. Will be there in 15 minutes. 500 rupees extra. I will be there five minutes. -Okay. -Okay. How is it going? Come now. Is he Dawood? He is Kaleel. Dawood's close friend. We need information on this guy's whereabouts. Dawood! We were playing ludo few minutes ago. He lost the game against me. He got upset and left. He is my close friend. I can take you to him. It will cost you 5,000 rupees. -5,000 rupees? -Yes! Just a minute, bro! Come here. They bought it? What do you say? Shall we give them 5,000 rupees? No, we are short of money. Don't worry. We'll get 50,00,000 rupees when we nab Dawood. Come, let's go. We are good with the deal, brother. Money? Wait, it takes time. What are your names? Tell me your names first. Raghupathi. Raghava. Rajaram. RRR. Yours? Khaleel. Gilani. Farook. KGF. One or two? -Prequel. -What is it? That will cost you 2,000 rupees. Never mind. I don't care. Right? Right. Let's go. You guys wait inside. Dawood will be here in half an hour. Arrest him. Why? Won't you wait with us? He is betraying his friend for money. Won't Dawood be upset when he gets to know it? So he wants to leave now. Dawood will be here in thirty minutes. You remember the plan, right? I am not very sure of it. Let's recall it quickly. Raja, what's our first step? -I will grab his legs. -Yeah, I will grab his hands. I will cover his nose with white handkerchief. He will fall unconscious. Let's dial 108. The police will be here. They will gives us loads and loads of cash. We'll count it. We'll dump it in our bag. And return to our village. Hey, look. Someone is coming. Let's get inside. I'm really scared. I'm scared as well. We shouldn't have come here. We hardly have any money left. What are we going to do? She may scold you sometimes But each time you cry Mother's… Heart aches She may beat you up sometimes But each time you are hurt But it is the mother Who feels the pain all the time That's the relationship Which can never break No matter what you do That relationship which has brought you up Will never fade What is in it? I don't know. My mother gave it to me. Why don't you open it? No. I lied to my mother and brought this. Once I reach home, I will apologize and return it. MISSING, RAJARAM MISSING, RAGHUPATHI MISSING, RAGHAVA I am missing my mother. He is hungry. He doesn't know how to express it. So, he says that way. Wait, let me get something to eat. -Hey, careful! -Okay. Raghupathi! Raja! -Let's go! -Come on. Hey! Stop the vehicle! Raja! Raja! Raja! Stop the vehicle! Stop it! -Raja! Hey! -Raja! Raja! -Raja! -Raja! What is your name? -Vikram, sir. -What do you do? I am the manager of TSR Multiplex, Rajajinagar. I was watching CCTV footage of my house. My daughter, Akshara has been kidnapped by our caretaker Padmavathi and two other men. Sir, please check if her number can be traced. It will take time. Come tomorrow. -Sir, I want to meet the inspector. -You will be called. Please sit down. Dad, let's play. I am really tired dear. Dad, you are always tired. -Sir. -Ma'am! Who wants this chocolate? Don't you want it? That's mine! My Akshara is the best. Let us play in the evening. -Please take this money, sir. -No. It's been two weeks. You did not find my daughter yet. Police job looks funny to you. Right? Would you react the same way if it was your child? Jagadishwar… Sir, by the time your daughter's case was filed… a total of 52 cases were open at that time. And that very next month, we received 80 cases. Now we have 92 open cases in total. There is great mismatch between number of cases and police personnel. So? Is there nothing you can do, sir? Shailaja. Investigative Journalist and Activist. She was quite helpful in catching two child trafficking gangs. She has good network with the child rescue operation teams. Meet her once. She'll help you. Who are you? I need your help. Hello! Coming right away! Akshara, my darling. Hey-- Who wants this chocolate? Don't you want it? Tell me. What should I take off now, sir? Skirt or shirt, sir? If you did not like her, you can check these other girls. She has been heavily drugged for many days, Vikram. It may need another week. There is no improvement. There are chances that home environment might help. We've been trying for six months now. She is not responding to medicines anymore. We haven't given up, Vikram. But we are not sure if she will recover. Sorry. Look at this report. Kids are being sold like goods. They are being made into slaves and prostitutes. They are forced to beg on the streets. Have they lost all humanity? Will they do anything for money? Here, look at him. He sold away his daughter to get drunk. Around 44,000 children in India are being trafficked every year. 20 lakh young girls are sold to red light areas. Why is nobody worried about them? What can we do? Tell me. I will be happy even if one kid is saved. I am ready to do anything. I am tired of fighting such issues. It's making no big difference. So? Are you going to give up? No, I am going to change the approach! It will involve some risks. Is that okay? It's a minor fracture. She should be fine. The doctor says that the reports are alright. She needs to rest for a week. He will be executing the operation day after tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. in Mangalore. It's not just 30 kids, but around 40 to 50 children are being trafficked. All the kids are in danger, Shailaja. Do you think news channels leaked the information? I have no idea about it. We don't have any update from our informer. Not a single clue about Ram Shetty's operation. Now saving the kids, and stopping Ram Shetty, is impossible Shailaja. Who are those guys? Where are they taking him? I'm asking you. Answer me! Will they kill him? Hey, stop crying. Take off your hand. Do you want me to stop crying? What else should I do? We would have been in our village happily. You planned to catch Dawood and get the prize money. Look at what has happened! Don't put the entire blame on me! You both agreed for this. The three of us together decided to do this. You always say that we do things together. You took us to play that monkey game in Ranganna's orchard. But you escaped as soon as Ranganna came there. We both were caught. He hit us with a big stick. -We couldn't sit for a week. -Hey. I did not even go to school on my birthday. I shared the chocolates and you ate all of it. And then stated that I am your best friend. I was wrong! Don't push it on me! You are responsible for this entire mess! -I will hit you! -Stop! -Hey, stop! -Hey! Let him go! What did he do? Do you want to know? He brought us here all the way from Vadamalpeta to nab Dawood. Dawood? We got to know that we will get money to catch Dawood! He lured us into this. -Did I lure you into this? -Hey! -Stop it! -He was the one, Sister. He said that we wouldn't become famous if we stay in Vadamalpeta. He said that we should go to Bombay and become famous. You said that? That's a lie, sister. He was the one who said it first. -When did I say that? -Take your hand off! He even got a bag to get the money and that's how he got us to Bombay. Bombay? Yes, he lured us and got us to Bombay! Someone kidnapped Rajaram. Answer her now! Do you want us to beg in Bombay? -Why are you blaming me for everything? -Hey-- You are the one who did all this. -Alright! -Don't you-- Stop it! I'll help you go home. Will you go on your own? Sister, be it to Bombay or our village, Raghupathi, Raghava, Rajaram will always go together. Are you Raghupathi or Raghava? Raghava. Raghupathi. Satish, file! Recognize the kidnapper for me. -Is it him? -No. -Is it him? -No He is the one! This bearded guy is the one who kidnapped our Rajaram. He is the one. -Ram Shetty's gang. -Do you know them? Sorry. Never apologize to a friend. You said that stopping Ram Shetty is impossible, right? We are now going to nab Ram Shetty. How? They will hunt Dawood. We are going to hunt Ram Shetty. Shailaja, we kept a check on the activities around Ram Shetty's estates. We couldn't find anything other than a large toys delivery. Galaxy Toys Store. Thank you, Satish. Sister, who are these guys on TV? The Avengers. Captain America, Ironman, Thor, Hulk. They are the saviors of the world. We never saw them, Sister. They are fictional characters. Fictional characters? Made-up characters. -Oh. -Oh. Listen. Tomorrow, we are going to catch Dawood. We are going to save your friend. Are we doing the right thing? Do we have any other option Vikram? What about these two kids? Should we risk their lives? Buddy, can we trust them? Look at their courage to nab India's most wanted criminal. They don't even know that Bombay and Bangalore are different. Yet their guts is inspiring and exactly what we need. I am not sure. I doubt that they are planning to steal our prize money. What should we do now? Let's ask her. Sister, please help us. We ran away from our village Our friend is missing from three days. We need to go back to our village. Please help us. Who are you? Where are you from? We are from Vadamalpeta, a village near Tirupati. Okay. Will you reach home safely if I get you to a bus? -Yes, we will. -We will. Save us! -Why are we being tied? -Leave me! -Let us go! -Let us go! Who are you all? Let us go! Shut up! We will drop you at a place tomorrow. Run along the streets we ask you to. Towards the end of the street, you will find a lady selling pooja items. Go to her and tell her that you are lost. Ask her for help. She will ask you to come with her. She and her men will then kidnap you. Pretend as if you are scared. Wasn't I too god at acting? Awesome, right? You fool! You should act like you are scared. And you over acted like it's a horror film. The judges of reality shows act better than you. Luckily he didn't notice. -Really? -Yes. Are they following us? Oh, God! Brother? Come fast! Right! There will be a very big security gate. We can follow you up to that point. After which, comes a mini forest. Why isn't it breaking? Take a right. Brother, I need to piss. It's urgent! Please stop. Hold it. Alright. I am going to piss in the car. Hey! Stop! Brother, hold this. Drops of piss may spill on it. Don't look at me like that. It happened the last time. Of course it dried up. Get lost! Get on. There are many routes in that forest. Only you will know which route they are taking you. It's important for you to guide us through that route. Hold on. Lift your hands. Go. Next. You! Lift your hands. Go… Take them in. -Come on! -Go in. Hurry up! Wash properly. Stand straight. Enough! It's done. Go on. Come fast. Hey, stand there. Stand here. Come here. Go. Go on. Buddy, let's search for Raja. The security guard changes at 6:00 p.m. You should be in his place tomorrow, Satish. It's getting late. Where are we going now? To the toys delivery van. A toys delivery van is headed to a place where nobody lives. Isn't it clear that it's for the kids? See here. Next. Hey! Raja. Raja. Do you know who kidnapped you? Who? Dawood. -Really? -Yes. Dawood knows that we came here to catch him. So, he kidnapped us. Do you think he is scared of us? No doubt at all! What should we do now? What's in the truck? Courier boxes, sir. Open it. Where is the delivery? Show me the delivery list. It's on dashboard, sir. Bring it. Get going. We will somehow send Raja's police toy to you guys. There will be a spy camera and an audio recorder inside. Take it. There are a lot of bad fellows over there. You must record their activities with the camera. You will find many kids like you. You should save them. Can you do it? -Yes, Sister. -Yes, Sister. We will do it. Louder! Can't hear you! Tell me. Will you save them just like the Avengers do? Sister, Captain America, Hulk, Ironman are just fictional characters. Raghupathi, Raghava, Rajaram are original. The bearded guy from the CCTV room is here. Get me some coffee. Hey! Watch them. Look at this. Ten kilometer radius. The entire area is under Ram Shetty's control. There are five private beaches in this area. Batapady Beach, Someshwara Beach, Ullal Beach, Summer Sand Beach, Uchila Beach. The operation is going to take place on one of these beaches. Children will be first put into small boats. And a ship somewhere far out in the sea will be waiting for the children. Once kids get into the ship, they are sent to other countries. How will we find the one beach where the operation takes place? Brother, where is the Summer Sand Beach? Shut up and eat. This is not the beach. I will irritate this guy until I find the name of the beach. -Hey. -Boss. The guys from Dubai will be here in the morning. The children will be ready by then. We need to get to Someshwara beach by 6:00 p.m. We need to get the children onto the boats by 7:00 p.m. When this is happening, we need to record it and make sure that it is telecasted live on all the major channels at the same time. Not just that, the kids will place bugs and cameras to record the happenings in the warehouse. They will be our solid proof. We will get national media attention with that. Why don't we place our men at all the five beaches? They are private beaches, Vikram. We will not be allowed. Also they are heavily guarded places. Even a suspicion… can land the kids in grave danger. What's the nuisance? The kids are being a bit mischievous. Let's see. Once Satish replaces the security guard there tomorrow, we will get to enter that place. We will get into the warehouse, get the audio and video recordings, and finally, the name of the beach. To find them all, to stop the operation and to expose Ram Shetty… we will have only one hour. 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. That's it. One second. What if we fail to find the right beach on time? We won't fail. Shailaja, what do we do if we fail? We will find it, Vikram. Shailaja. -What happened? -We have bad news. They killed our Mumbai informer. What is it? It's very good. -What, bro? -It's good. Let me see. Do you just sing or play games as well? -We play games as well, sir. -We play games as well, sir. What's your favorite game? -Cricket! -Cricket! Cricket? Superb! What do you do? I am a batsman. -How about you? -I am a fast bowler, sir. -You? -Umpiring, sir. Wow! Umpiring! You are the one I want. Come! Okay, sir. Do you know Billy Bowden? Buddy, come here. He is an umpire. He dances while signaling fours and sixes. I showed you his video the other day. Yeah! I know him. Super! -You come here. -Brother. We two are going to play a game now. You will decide whether it's a four or a six. -Okay? -Yes, sir! Let's play that slap game. -Brother? -Come, slap me! -How can I slap you, brother? -Slap me! No, brother. Was it a four or a six? That's a no run, sir. No run! Was that a four or a six? It's a four, sir. Not like that. Signal that in Billy Bowden style. Show it to me. It's a four, sir. Come on. Slap me. No, brother. Was that a four or a six? Six. You are here to guard the children. And not to watch videos on YouTube? There shouldn't be a single problem tomorrow. This is what happens when any of you or the children misbehave. How is the game? Isn't it better than cricket? Go and sleep. Let's go…Let's go. My wife is at home There are beers in the fridge I am going to party all night! Brother, please stop. Brother, we are from a nearby village. We need your help. We are waiting since morning. My husband took all the money and asked to wait here. He hasn't returned. We have a bus to catch. Son, come here. My son is terrified and crying. If you see anyone wearing floral shirt on the way, please tell him that we are waiting here. Please don't forget. Please help us. We will be waiting here. Okay, I'll tell him if I see him. Thanks. What a terrible husband! Hi. You will be feeling sick today. You will take a sick leave. Your brother is going to take your place for today. Who are you all? -Watch this video. -Video? I am going to dub it for you. I've been waiting for an year. You said that you will murder your wife, take all the money and run away. Tomorrow is the last chance. I will be waiting for you. Our flight to Dubai is at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow. I am leaving with our child. You are coming. You are coming! That's all! Do you think my wife is going to believe this? I don't know about that. But she definitely is going to suspect you for entire life. You can't scare me like this. I knew you wouldn't be scared. But what if, I send the same video to your boss Ram Shetty? I will dub it one more time for you. Watch. I've been waiting for an year for this opportunity. You took money to trap Ram Shetty. Keep looking. This is our last chance. Our comrades are waiting for you. Tomorrow, a ship is going to Dubai at 7:00 p.m. There are a lot of kids in that. You are going to save them. You are going to save them. That's all. Who are all these people? School friends. No. School? My husband studied only till sixth class. Fifth class, B section. Your husband was a topper in those days. What do you say? He failed in class six. How was he a topper in class five? Am not fool to believe it. Even your wife doesn't believe you. Your boss is going to break your bones and slash you into pieces. Who is the lady in that video? She is our constable Vanajakshi. Very sincere police officer. Acting is her passion. So gave her a chance. Use our influence and arrange a police patrol at the security gate. Today, no outsiders should be allowed inside. Okay, sir! Bro. Is this water as cool as the water of Ullal Beach? Shut up and mind your business. Go! Vishwa? Something is happening in that room. We need to place this camera in that room. We have exactly… four minutes. Hey! Give me the coffee. Thrashed him like anything. We need to fix the spy cam in that room. We need to deviate them to get the camera fixed. We must break the bulb to deviate them. That is when they would get distracted. Okay? But who is going to break the bulb? I'll do it. How long do I wait for my coffee? -Damn it! -Damn it! -Damn it! -Oh, no! If that CCTV guy goes back to his room, we will get caught. Please aim properly. Sir. We ran out of groceries. Yes! Super, Raja! Great hit. Come on! You go and get the ladder. Come on! Keep it here. -Hey! -Sir. Looks like the kitchen needs some groceries. Go and check it out. Careful. What are you doing here? We are playing, sir. You are playing here? Why are you playing here? You should not come here. Go away. -Alright, sir. -Okay, sir. Move, guys! Where did you guys go? Sir, a bulb's broken in the other room. We went to check it out. I told you to make sure no one comes here, didn't I? Yes, sir. Shailaja. They fixed the camera. Okay. Come in a queue. I was scared that we would be caught. I know that we will be out in time. Stand in line. -Greetings. -Greetings. -Hey. -Hey! Looks like Dawood is here. Please come. Let's go upstairs. Who among them is Dawood? How many are they? Five. What are they wearing? Four of them are in suits. One of them is dressed like a Sheikh. Dressed like a Sheikh? That means he's covering his face. That fellow in Dubai Sheikh attire-- Who is he? He is Dawood. My personal cook. Oh! Have these dates, sir. -No -It's very yummy. You will like it. Then, who are those people in suits? They must be his security guards. -Vishwa? -Yes, brother. Get them ready. Come fast. Come. Come on. Stand in a queue. Send him in. Take your shorts off. Go. Come on. Remove your vest. Remove your shorts. Remove your shorts. Quick! Turn around. Turn this side. Remove your underwear. -Brother… -Remove it! Remove it! Are you going to remove it or not?

The audio recorder is switched on as well. Shailaja, I am going to the station. I know a guy who can help us. Satish, S.I. Kodichikknahalli, Bangalore. Yes, tell me. I need to speak about Ram Shetty. That's the plan, sir. Have you gone crazy? You are just three guys. They are dangerous criminals. That's why we are asking for your help. Hey! I will get you full proof evidence. I can only help when I see the audio and video recordings. Okay, sir. On which beach is the operation taking place? Is the sand on Batapady Beach just like this? Is it slippery? Go away! Go! Stand in the queue. This is not the one. Which beach is it? Don't worry. I will find that out. When? We are running out of time. Only two more beaches are left. I will find out soon. Put them all in truck. We have half an hour left. Have all of them been given medicines? Yes, two more minutes. The truck is here. How do we find out the name of the beach? All those who are done, come over this side. Hurry up! Come on, hurry up! Go! Brother, where are we going? To Uchila Beach? Hey! Just follow my orders! Don't act smart. Go! Guys, it's Uchila Beach. -Really? -Yes. Did you see how angry he got when I told the name of the beach? So? He didn't get angry when I mentioned other beaches. But this time, he got angry. We'll have to inform them the name of the beach. Let's go. Apparently, there are three to four buildings in there. He is not sure where they have put the kids. -Shall we go? -Let's go. What happened? If he falls sick on the right time… and sends his brother as replacement then they are definitely going to get suspicious. So? Today, you are going to work. Forget your sickness. What? You are going to let us in. You want me to let you in? You! Get lost! That will never happen in this lifetime. I will come. I'll come for you. For our child. I love you. I will have them arrested. For the sake of the children, I will get them arrested. I'll make it happen! What should I do now? By 6:15 p.m., get the children in the trucks. Within half an hour, they must reach Someshwara Beach. By 7:00 p.m., shift the children onto boats. We haven't written the name of the beach yet. What are we going to do? Hurry up. Uchila. Brother, I need to pee urgently. I will be back in two minutes. It's urgent! -Go! -Thanks, brother. Follow him and come back quickly. Okay, brother. Hey! Hey! Why are the police vehicles here? They are patrolling vehicles. They are sometimes parked here. You go and deviate the police. What happened, brother? What were you doing? Let's go, brother. -Wait for a minute, I'm coming. -Hey, come. Coming, brother. Let's go. Save me! Sir, save me.

I will search the beach name. We have exactly ten minutes. -Shiva! -Sir. -Assemble our team. -Yes, sir! Come on. Move fast! -What if we check all the beaches? -Impossible. Wasting time on one wrong beach is enough. By the time we reach right beach, all the children will be gone. Wait for a minute, I'm coming. Why do you cut the letters from the newspaper?

But you pulled him in. -You did it. -Hey! Blame me again and I will hit you! I will also hit back hard. -Stop it now! -Do it! Come let's fight. Stop you guys. Hey, stop it! Take the right turn. Someshwara is to our left, sir. Let everyone think that we are going to Someshwara. But we will execute the plan at Uchila Beach. No one should know about it until the last minute. Are you sure about the name of the beach? He always gives out wrong answers to any question confidently. Breaking news! Child trafficking operation busted.
