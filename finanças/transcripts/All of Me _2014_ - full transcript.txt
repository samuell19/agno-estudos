All of me I'm twenty-four years old. I have two sons. My oldest is nine. He is called Daniel. There's also Jorge, who is six. I used to live with Jorge's dad. We lived together for five years. He left for the U.S. and left me here, pregnant. He was still working there when little Jorge was born. His dad came back by the time he started walking. But he used to drink too much. He did drink too much, and he was very rough. I can't really say what he was like. You couldn't say a word to him, he was very aggressive. DOG'S BUCKET Good morning! I would like my kids to get a degree one day... ...because around these parts... ...you can only be a cane-cutter or a day labourer. You can only make very little money. So, we're doing our best... ...so they get a better education and a better life in the future. I used to work as a maid... ...and it's a very nice job... ...but I want them to have a different life than I had. I want them to have a better future than mine. I would like to defend people in need. Get wrongfully convicted people out of prison. I guess that's why I want to study law. When Mom asked us what we wanted to study... ...I told her that I wanted to study journalism. In those days, there was a big news story... ...about the murder of some missing journalists... ...in Sinaloa or Tamaulipas, where violence is highest. So, she told me that... ...if I ever write something that they don't like... ...or harms their interests, they'll come after me. That they'd track my name, and simply... ...kill me or get me fired from my job. And I thought that what she said was true. That's the reality we're living in, they don't like the truth. Who am I? Who am I? Well... I have always worked as a homemaker... ...and in the fields. My life has always been like that. One day, my husband was drinking with his nephew out on the corner. A friend of his came up to him, telling him to stop talking trash. There was no more discussion, he just... ...came up to him and shot him. He shot him through the cheek. My husband died instantly. How long can you go on without eating, José? Two weeks. Really? You don't poop, then. How could you, without food? I was never interested in studying. You know what my dream was as I was growing up? I loved to sing and dance, and all that. I used to sing and dance all the time. I used to pray to heaven to let me sing in a band. That's what I used to think. My mother was always short of money. We started working when we were thirteen. I was the first to go, Clementina followed later. And then Toña went off to find work as well. As soon as we were old enough, they hired us out as maids. And we had to live in the house we worked. I spent a year working in Amatlán. And then I went to Córdoba... ...which was way classier than Amatlán. I spent about three years working for a family there. Then, I moved to Sta. Leticia for two-and-a-half years. And then I got engaged and all my plans went to hell. You get married, have kids, and then it's all over. You don't know a man until you live with him. That's when he shows his true face. But by then, what can you do? Love is finished, everything is finished. Your illusions about marriage are finished. You lose the harmony you had as newlyweds. When you're just married, you're a new toy... ...later, you're a piece of old furniture. How can you feel any affection for a husband who's so mean? Who comes home drunk and wants to beat you... ...who always cusses you out, what kind of a love is that? - Is the cart full yet? - No, there's nothing in it. Is all the water gone? We'll have to fill bottles. I told them not to make me cook rice because I can't do it. What little I make for myself always turns out awful. I didn't want to cook rice... ...but they said that all of us should help with the rice... ...so I thought I'd give it a try, I would make an effort. I would give it my all... ...and put love and effort into it so they'd be able to eat it. And it actually worked, my first batch was very good. I had to admit to myself that it was very tasty. It was so good, we ran out. I was even more pleased. I'm a sister here for the 'Patronas' group. Today is my turn to cook, and I had to make... ...about 10 kilos of soybeans... ...some totopes because we had cold tortillas... ...but not enough bread. We're packing into the lunches some tuna, a bag of rice... ...a bag of tuna... ...and about five totopes in each one. We used all the tortillas for the totopes. Here we also have some boiled beans... ...and the rice we'll pack as we wait for the train. We heard the train is coming, but not for a little while. Take this one, Mom. Those have tuna in them, take these too. It makes me very pleased, it's really moving. But it also makes me sad, I'm sad because... ...they are going away, leaving their families. But I'm glad they take a lunch, something for the road. That's how I feel, pleased and sad. Do you have any family across the border? No. I think I heard somewhere... ...it just came to mind, that you've thought about-- - Sorry? - Leaving for something better. Yes, it's true. Because of what I've lived and how I've suffered, yes... ...I'd like my children to have it better... ...God willing. I'm thinking about leaving... ...because here in Córdoba, they pay you the minimum. The wages around here barely keep us from starving. You have to take risks, because if I never take any... ...I'll always be here, in this hole. I wouldn't take the train, I'd take a bus. The train is too dangerous. Especially because one can't help falling asleep... ...and it's very dangerous. But yes, that's my dream. I'd go by myself first, and if all goes well... ...I'd send for Jorge. My oldest son would stay here to study... ...but Jorge is too restless. I wouldn't leave him. Out of my way. Go on, out of my way. I'll give you a bath in a minute. We still have to fill water bottles, right? Since I was the youngest in my family... ...I always worked in the fields with my mom and dad. But later, when I thought about getting married... ...I told my parents... ...that I wanted to get a job because I wanted to marry. So, I started looking for work. Eventually I found a job at a factory... ...and I've worked there ever since. You go through a whole day without even noticing it. You might be welding high up, or inside a container... ...you might be somewhere you can barely crawl through... ...and you might spend the whole day there. I guess that's what makes it more tiring, you know? But I enjoy what I do. It's a good kind of tired. I work every single day of the year. Well, this past Easter I took Good Friday off... ...because I worked during last year's. In any case, I practically work from Sunday to Sunday. I make too little money, I can't make ends meet. So, I spend my life in debt. I borrow money and my wages go to make payments because... ...put it like this, when school starts... ...my wages are not enough to get by on. You have to buy supplies and uniforms. These are expenses that I can't cover... ...with my wages, so I borrow money. Sometimes he talks about going up north... ...but I've talked him out of it because our kids are here... ...and at least he has a job, even if he doesn't make much. I've told him that as long as we are both healthy... ...at least here we'll get to see our kids grow up. - They'll give you a ride, son. - Did he get left behind? - He fell off. - Did he? Get the car and take him to the freight station. - Did you fall off? - Yes. I couldn't get back on the train. - Where are you from? - Honduras. - Were your friends on it? - Yes. Do you want to leave or rest up for a while? No, I'd like to catch the train. My friends are all on it. The guys wouldn't let me climb aboard. Well, it was going too fast. This is the one with macaroni. - He has one with macaroni. - It's fine, then. Here are some totopes and some beans. - Just totopes and beans. - I'm telling you to give him both. You should grab your bag, just in case. Thank you. I'm riding the train all the way up north. Maybe, with God's help. - How old are you? - I'm twenty-four. - What do you want to do there? - I want to work in construction. - Had you eaten? - Yes, but... ...I wanted to take some more because night was falling... ...and the train doesn't stop, so there's no way to get food. I got off to get some food, but couldn't get back on it. It's a real joy to be helped with food like this. - Is this your first time? - No, the second... ...but I crossed a year ago and I've forgotten the way. Right. We have food here. - Tell them to come. - Come here! - There's food here! - Come on! Can you give me some food? If there is not enough, you'll have to share. - Of course. - We're traveling together. All we have left is a few baked goods. - Some water? - Water! - Where are you from? - I'm from Guatemala. Guatemala? Has 'the Beast' left? If you'd gotten here sooner, Immigration would've caught you. There was a raid here last Monday, I think. - How long is it since you left? - Eleven days. Not many trains leave from Tenosique... ...and when they do, they're slower than a snail. The train was too crowded to get back on. If I had been able to get on, the first cars called gondolas... ...were too packed, I could've fallen off. - The last ones were also packed. - And the stairs are too high. - All the best to you. - Thank you, thanks. - Take care of yourself. - All right, you too. - Same to your friends. - Thank you! - God bless you. - Take care. Who is Lorena? How would you describe her? Lorena... ...please don't ask me that. Go on, Lore, tell us. Talk to us. Well... ...no, please don't ask. This was going so well. So, what can I say? Behind this big, strong, formidable woman... ...there used to exist, I'm not her anymore... ...a woman... ...who has been... ...through everything. My father was an alcoholic, and when I was little... ...I had to find work, I was eleven or twelve. I started to take charge of my house. I was very affected by an illness. I was very ill for about a year... ...but I pulled through it. After my surgery... ...I spent about a year terribly depressed... ...because my family had left me there alone. I wasn't doing well. And after all that, here I am. Who is Karla? She's just a regular girl. Somewhat humble, smiling... ...and also a little fragile. She tries to work hard for what she wants. Such kind people! Thanks for the food. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. There used to be 25 of us instead of 14... ...but that was before people started talking. In 1995 they said it was illegal to help migrants... ...that we could be charged with smuggling migrants. Many of the women left to avoid getting in trouble... ...but we carried on. One day, a train came by with about 500 migrants. The train stopped at La Patrona and it was 11:30 pm... ...when a woman from our group knocked at my door. She told me that the train had just stopped... ...and that there was an injured boy aboard. His wife was there too, asking for my help. I found in her expression how I could serve God. I didn't even think about it, I just agreed to help. It was late at night when I got to the tracks... ...and I saw there were about 500 migrants. I didn't know these people or what I was getting into... ...but I trusted that God had put me there for a reason. And as I prayed... ...I felt something cover me from head to toe. It was like a chill that took over me. It left me as soon as it came, but it took all my fear away. The boys came up to the truck saying: "Mother, help us." I said I would help, but only the injured one... ...and they said by helping him I was helping all of them. Seeing the image of that migrant... ...who was a black man... ...as they lowered him like a crucified Christ. His arms were outstretched, and as they lowered him... ...everyone was waiting to support his feet. To see that image was to say: "There is Christ." "There is Christ who needs my help and support." I was there to serve Christ, so when they lowered him... ...everyone carried him very carefully to the truck. He had been stabbed by someone who wanted to steal his wife. He had tried to defend himself, but he still got stabbed. He was running a fever and barely groaning... ...so I asked God to let him live, to help him get better. We took him to a clinic, but they wouldn't treat him. Then we took him to a doctor who said that... ...since he was here illegally, he couldn't be treated. Seeing as they wouldn't treat him, we brought him back here... ...and decided to care for him. I knew a little about medicines... ...at least I knew what they were for. We bought him pain-killers and antibiotics... ...and we gave him a bath to bring the fever down. We stayed up all night and at 6:00 am... ...he regained consciousness and asked where he was. We looked at each other and heaved a sigh of relief. He and his friends stayed with us for more than 25 days. They left in September and called us on Christmas Day... ...to let us know they had crossed the border. That experience was a way for me to serve God. I had found my answer, that was my service... ...so we began our work along the railway tracks. Not at church, on the tracks. It's what we do. I used to work on the fields. I was nine when my father signed me up for school. I only studied for a year, I didn't even get a certificate. I was ahead of my class, I really enjoyed it. My handwriting was good, I was ahead of the class. Back in those days when I went to school... ...it's when they started giving kids vaccinations. That was the year they started doing it. But someone told my father vaccines made one sterile... ...so my father pulled me from school. My brother and I missed a whole year. He decided I was better off wielding a hoe. Since he owned a horse and a donkey... ...he gave me the donkey... ...and before 7:00 am, I'd be on my way. I'd tie it up when I got there and start weeding. Over by Cruz Verde, it was my fate to work there. We planted beans and chili peppers. When the plants were this high, I'd pile soil around them... ...and pull out the weeds. That was my job. On Saturdays, if I didn't want to go... ...my father would send me to harvest hay. I like that. I like it very much. I sometimes think that if my father hadn't taught me how to work... ...I don't know where I'd be. He didn't send me back to school. He'd say that women grow up to marry and have children. He said women didn't need to study. What could I say to that? This is 2013, so it was in 2011. It was a Sunday, at around 6:00 pm. We were waiting for the train, like we do every day. The train was coming, so all of us came out. The train had two engines... ...one for each of its two sections. It was crowded from top to bottom, I counted maybe 800 people. My mother was last in line, then there was me... ...and then the rest of the women. The train slowed down and they started getting off. And they just grabbed the food, we didn't get to hand it out. We had to step aside and let them take it... ...because we could've been hurt as they grabbed it. There was a boy who came with twelve of his friends... ...and he got off the train to grab some lunches. He got lunches for all his friends, but then the train picked up speed. It started going faster, but he didn't get on. He kept handing out lunches to his friends. I saw some of them get back on however they could... ...but this boy kept falling off, everyone got back on but him. We shouted from afar: "Don't get back on!" "Don't get back on, we'll give you a ride." "Don't get back on! Stay here!" "We'll catch the train in Orizaba or Córdoba." But he didn't listen. He tried to clamber aboard, but he fell down. He tried one more time and he fell off again. I started running towards him to stop him from trying again. He didn't get up after that and the train left. He was lying face down when I reached him. I told him not to worry, we'd get him to the station. And he says: "no, my foot." It was twisted backwards. I said "Oh, my God" and shouted for my aunts. My mother and I turned him over... ...and that's when I saw the blood trickling down. The boy couldn't resist looking. He lifted his pant leg and saw his foot dangling by the skin. I saw him and he said: "Mother, don't leave me alone." "I'm going to die." I crouched next to him... ...and hugged him close to my chest. I told him: "You won't die, we'll take care of you." "You are not alone, son." My aunts huddled around him and started crying. None of us had seen something like that. Norma and Lupe took him to the Red Cross... ...but they wanted to know who'd pay for his treatment. Norma told them we didn't have any money. Norma went to Yanga Hospital and talked to them. He was transferred there and they admitted him. At 12:30 am they took him to the operating room... ...to finish amputating the boy's foot. It was my turn to visit on Tuesday so I went to the operating room... ...and I asked the doctor about Cristóbal Tambriz. He said: "Ah, the Guatemalan." And I said yes. The doctor told me he was doing fine... ...but I told him that none of us had seen him. My sister-in-law and my niece couldn't see him the day before. "How could I believe you if we haven't seen him?" The doctor asked me if I was a family member. I answered that I wasn't but that we helped... ...feed our migrant brothers at the tracks in La Patrona. So he agreed to let me see him... ...only for five minutes. Cristóbal broke down crying. He wanted to see his mom and asked about her. I told him he could talk to her but he had to wait a little. Norma would be by later with a cell phone for him. He asked me to promise him, those who speak K'iche'... ...put great trust in any promises made. So I promised him that he could talk to her... ...but he had to take it easy until we could get him a phone. His mother had been fasting for his health. She had been fasting for eight days. She wanted us to stay by her son's side... ...and we told her that we would. He said: "Will you be my mom here?" I said I'd be a temporary mom. And I told him: "You'll have other moms, not just me." "There are many of us supporting you." "Even if they don't let us come inside..." "...we'll be right outside keeping an eye on you." He worried about the money for his prosthesis... ...but I told him he would surely walk again. He asked me again to promise him... ...and I promised that he would walk again. - The two biggest ones. - You lost a lot of weight! - No, he was like that. - Of course not. - His face is too thin. - What did you expect? It's just lack of sleep from traveling by bus. - It's better sleeping in your bed. - But it beats the train. - That's a given. - The train is worse because... - ...it's easier to sleep. - I think he looks well. "Despite all I've suffered," as the song goes. - He looks well despite it all. - Does the priest know you're here? - Or did you just leave? - He said I should stay. - I've been there four days. - Four days? - I just heard you were back. - Don't tell me that. I tried calling you but I didn't get through. I forgot to give you her number, sometimes I lose the signal. I get reception here, but not at home. What will you do now? What are your plans? - The next step is helping others. - You can help us for now. After that, God will guide us. Isn't that right, Cristóbal? - Do you remember her? - Yes, of course. - She's Mariela's mother. - Yes, Mariela's mother. - Do you remember all of us? - Yes, I do. - I thought you'd bring your mom. - I'm sorry? No, they won't let her in. - Why not? - She wears different clothes. - But they let you in? How? - I took a bus. - She wears traditional clothes? - Yes, like this. - Like a 'huipil'? - Yes. The clothes they wear there. Like these. - This is what they wear. - Oh, look at that. - Is she your sister? - Yes. - It's just a skirt. - Looks like a 'huipil.' These are your girlfriends, right? Oh, Cristóbal. I reasoned he had lost a foot because of a lunch... ...and I was about to quit because... ...it could happen again and it wouldn't be fair. But then I thought... ...that many more people would come on the train... ...and I couldn't just quit after one of them fell off. I was feeling guilty. Careful! We're all family. Cousins, aunts, and my grandma. My grandma was the one who started it all. She was the first along with aunt Rosa and Bernarda. When we first started, we had to deal with... ...people who had no idea. The first time I went to... ...the offices of the National Institute of Migration... ...I came across a person who was worse than I was. I wanted to get information about... ...what migration was and what I could do legally... ...to help the migrants. You have to know the law. I try to make sure that they respect us... ...and that we respect them, we can't fight each other. It's not a pissing contest, you know? Each of us have a job to do, and do it properly... ...as long as we don't overstep the limits they set up for us. We have our limits as well, they can't go into our mess... ...and arrest the migrants. It's about mutual respect. We have to know that it's about understanding... ...and working as a team, not just doing what we want. As for other departments, when they ask me... ...to give talks to the police, I always accept... ...because they often hurt them and they have to know... ...that they are not allowed to do that. It's better if I go there and they hear it from me... ...because I know that migrants complain about the police. Sometimes I feel such impotence. I have seen some things, like the people on the train... ...and how their rights get trampled over... Those motherfuckers, how dare they... ...take advantage of the helpless who have the hope... ...of crossing the border? But these motherfuckers... ...kidnap and murder them. What can they take from them? What do you think? At first, my husband... ...would get home from work and didn't find me there... ...as every husband should, but I told him... ...he should come see the work I do. So, one day he came to help me... ...and he got to see a train with many people on it. Now he gets spare bottles from his workplace... ...and he is trying to get the mess hall he eats at... ...to donate any leftover tortillas to us. They will be helping us with some tortillas. Even five or six kilos will be a great help. We can always make them into totopes. Twice he has been on trips with my sister. They went to Tenosique. And he saw how dangerous that stretch is for migrants. The people on the train suffer too much. Take it away. You have to whistle! We've been here five days, today is the 7th. That means we got here on April 2nd. They gave us a warm welcome, we're helping feed the migrants. We go out into the tracks... ...to hand out water, bread, rice, beans, and tortillas. I felt happy and satisfied because I know that... ...we are helping the Patronas as well as the migrants. I'm giving back to them, I'm happy to help my people. Back in Honduras we eat lots of beans and rice. We don't have to be ashamed, wherever we are. We are simple folk who love to work... ...mainly in the fields because that's how we were raised. I want to tell you about Jesús, a boy from Chiapas. He was a migrant, as he left his home. He told me he got on the train out of economic necessity. He was headed for Sonora to cross the border... ...and have a better future, but in a stretch near La Patrona... ...he fell of the train. The train kept going... ...and mutilated him, it took both his legs. The following day I heard he was in a hospital in Córdoba, alone. Norma asked me to look after him... ...and I said I would, without knowing him. I left very early, at about 8:30. I was nervous, what could I say to a 23-year-old boy... ...who had lost his legs forever? To someone who had his whole life ahead of him? How could I even ask how he was feeling? But I went in there and said hello. I asked him his name and we started talking. I was there the whole day and he told me... ...that there was a reason God had sent him here... ...even after losing his legs, he said he'd make an effort. He said he'd work if we helped with his prosthesis. I was taken aback, I felt bad because... ...sometimes a little problem can make us feel... ...as if the world were ending. But this boy who'd never get his legs back... ...was so eager to live, it was the push I needed. If he wasn't giving up, then neither was I. We're leaving! Goodbye! Thank you for everything you've done for us! Well, a boy used to court me. Everything was going well. He said he wanted to marry me and all that. But he said: "That costs money, I can't make enough here." He said he'd cross the border, that it was hopeless here. He often called after he left, but then the calls stopped. Afterwards, I stopped hearing from him. Eight or nine years later, he came back. He asked me to marry him but I said no. And after that... ...I thought every man I met might be the same. It would be like that again, so I'd rather not. We're always stuck in the kitchen. - Oswaldo, do me a favor. - What? Ask your aunt Lourdes for her pestle. - But why? - This one is too smooth. It's too smooth and I can't grind with it. - It doesn't work? - Go ask aunt Lourdes. Bring it here, please. When we go to an event we've been invited to... ...like when we give talks, we bring our chili peppers. We try to sell them so that we can keep things afloat. - To keep investing, too. - Exactly, to get something back. We have to make back the money we put in. It's a way of making money so we can invest it again. It's a way of making more work for us. Karina... ...she is someone who wants many things. Even though those things are not easy to get. She dreams of saving the world, but it's not possible. She tries to always speak the truth. She is very sentimental. Capable of achieving anything, like many migrants. Don't try to get on! We'll give you a ride in a minute! God didn't set up barriers between countries. We are the ones who raise them. Young people have to keep their eyes open... ...because our whole future depends on them. Son of a--! What's up? What's up, son? This is the last one. There, there. Oh, that's great. It's nice to hear your voice. No, I'm all right. Iván stayed behind. He's going back to Honduras, but I'm here with Alex. Luis is with us, too. And what did he say? What route is he taking? Iván is already by the place they caught us. In Coatzacoalcos. Alex, she said we should wait for him! Tell her we will meet him at the migrant's house in Orizaba. Mommy, if he calls again or if he calls Mrs. Olga.. ...tell him we'll be waiting in Orizaba. I love you, Mommy. Take care, I will too. Say hello to my sisters and give a kiss to Dad. Mommy, I'm not sad, these are happy tears. - We're close to Orizaba, right? - Yes, Orizaba. Yes. Yes, we are all right. They gave us food... ...sweaters, clothes, everything. Even the phone call. No, Alex is taking good care of me. Goodbye, Mommy! Who? I'm so happy Iván is coming. Goodbye. Oh, Mommy. Has Cynthia had her baby? OK, then. Goodbye. Goodbye, Mommy. I love you, kisses. Could you hang up for me? I couldn't hang up. END OF VILLAGE People don't help us with money, they help with clothes... ...shoes, cooking oil, rice, and beans. That's what we work with. This is the bread that we've been helping with. This is what we can share from what God gives us. We do the work, but people do their bit. They bring things, without them we wouldn't be here. - These are missing something. - Those over there are ready. - That's why I put them there. - Are these the sweet ones? - No, those have tuna in them. - And nothing else? That's a nice-looking rice. Pass me one with beans. - Who is Antonia? - What? Who is Antonia Romero? Who are you? How do I describe myself? Do you mean, fat? You'd better turn that off. Aunt Berna, it's very crowded! Jorge, sit down. Sit down over there. Dani is a person... ...who has managed to get by despite everything. Someone who may fall down, but who picks herself up. Dani doesn't stop, she keeps going. I've never given up. My goals always seem so far off... ...but I think I'm managing to achieve them. Run, Tere! - We'd rest. - When we got there. It was still a long way off, further up. We were halfway there. My whole life has been all about work. In coffee-picking season, there is nothing here. He would leave early, like the other men. They don't do housework, you know? His mother would come pick coffee with me. We'd catch up with him later and bring lunch. We left at 8:00 am and reached the top of the hill at 9:00. We would walk to the other side. Around the hill... ...towards the picking grounds. It took us another hour. We'd get there at about 9:30 or 10:00. We'd start picking coffee, we did well if there was a lot... ...and when there wasn't, we'd get at least 30 kilos. And when we got back, we'd keep working. As women, we always had a lot of work to do. Here in the countryside there isn't always work. Sometimes we earn money, sometimes we don't. There have been times when I've had nothing... ...not even beans. Nothing, I had nothing. No money at all. What can you do? What if you get sick? No money for the doctor or anything. You could borrow money, but what if you can't get a loan? - The train is coming, right? - Yes, it's coming. Daniela, save something for the ones at the back! Save something for them! - Be very careful, all right? - Good evening. Good evening, be careful. Thank you! My goodness! Get back on! Run! Thank you! Thank you! - God bless you, mother! - God bless you, too. Every day since 1995, the Patronas have been feeding migrants. From time to time, they receive donations... ...from people and universities, consisting of bread, beans, rice... ...tuna, eggs, clothes, and plastic bags. Official sources indicate that almost two million migrants... ...cross the U.S. border every year. It is estimated that around 400,000 of them come from... ...Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.
