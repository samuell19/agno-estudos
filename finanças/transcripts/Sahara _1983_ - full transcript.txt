We got it! Sensational, Dale, the best time until now How much did we do? 86 seconds per lap. We reached the 110. On the last lap something broke in the gearbox. Was in third and began to vibrate. - He may have broken the shaft. - Let's take it down. Let me know as soon as find out. "Has Mr. Chase said anything?" - Still early. Sponsors like to play cat and mouse. Will not make better investment as in Gordon Packard. We'll know soon enough. He's going to come home tonight. - Your party? - To my party? Thank you for having me. warned, father. You will receive the guests. Put on a dress. - What do you think? - A dismay. - My daughter or the car? - Both. I am a man of few words. I devoted my life to company. You're full of debt. I bet everything I had on Gordon Packard. And you saw it. It's a good car. Further on a flat road, but how do you react? in difficult conditions? Like great distances, hard or alkaline roads? With high under sandstorms? - You look like the Sahara. - Yeah. The Sahara World Rally. There are five cars, but each one is a legend. A Rolls, a Bentley, a Saab in Hispano Suiza, An Alfa Romeo and a Mercedes. It has a nice car, but before you hand him over a contract of 60 million, I want to see this thing run through hell and win. What's wrong, String? The engine is clean, but we discovered metal in the gearbox and I want to withdraw it. The engine is fine. The transmission is worrying. Dale said it sounded like a gear shift. Yes you can be sure if I try. I'm going for a ride on the runway. Whatever it is, will grind or munch. You promised that would be easy. Erwing, what happened? MS. Gordon, there was an accident. You were right about the transmission. The wheels got stuck. I know dad, we'll talk tomorrow ... The left front suspension was destroyed. Do not speak. Hey, shit! The last time we'll meet. I hear nothing! This car is all for us. My plans for the future is for you, for the company. We know that o that's best but the Chase Group wants one last experiment, a race of resistance along the desert. The Sahara World Rally. We can win. We can win ... - It's a very difficult race. "It was my father's dream. It was his life ... and now, mine. - more than guiding ... - What you mean? An organized race by members of a club very elegant that they are very members. They have rules. Do not let a woman guide nor even to the starting line. s for men. String thought that, since I'm here, I can drive. Andy, do not worry. Check it out! What a surprise... Welcome to Morocco. - The American car? - . My name is Dale Gordon. Son, of course ... We better drink account of our friend. I am Captain Brown, of the United Kingdom quota. This Enrico Betrocelli, our Italian rival. a sensational rider, but never won a race. "You talk too much." - Welcome aboard. - He's new ... "Dad beat me once." Who does not win? - Forget it. - It worked! Do not forget to go to men's bathroom. What place is that? Who are these men? They are from the Chambra tribe. They come from the desert to buy women. Buy women? My name is Dale Gordon. There must be 2 reserved rooms for me and my team. I'm so sorry, but we are full. - But I booked the rooms! - Sorry, but we do not have anything. Sorry, but maybe I can help. I'm Eric Von Glessing. They must have canceled the reservations when they heard about death of his father. "You knew my father?" - Very well. I have to arrange accommodation somewhere else. As this is the only hotel in El Jarida, it will be difficult. But I have a dream. very large. Take Mr. Gordon to su te n 23. - Thank you very much. - It's a pleasure. I do not want anything to happen to you. before we started the race. No car, you will not. to start a race. His car is known by the Mirage. They are annoyed by me. do not show my car, a custom that your father understood and respected. You knew him very well, did not know I beat him once. But it was always a pleasure run against a Gordon. The best player win. Gentlemen, welcome to morocco. I am Major Duvain, military attache, and I represent the French government in Western Sahara. Allow them to suggest that you forget the so-called Sahara Rally and return to your countries. The reason for the change in our policy a tribal war about happening in the dunes. North Africa is on the brink of a tribal war. How wonderful! You know what? tribal war, mr. Brown? For sure. Everyone knows. So I suggest you do not the shortest route, because it's a car with wings could cross these dunes. For the longest route, it would take 9 to 10 days. Do not forget that the route the shorter you have a poo, there is no gas, elevations or landmarks. Just a tribal war and the Chambra. - Good luck. - Equally. Someone saw the second car of Von Glessing? He must plot another of his dirty tricks. Too late for to worry about it. Stop it. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your attention. When the cannon fires the race... - Now? - Now. A mess! - We got it! - I knew! Let's win the race. Did you see that? Check. - What do you suggest? - The longest way. It will take six to seven days by the longest way. By the shortest path, we'll save 3, maybe 4 days. They are at war and can kill it. - Who's that? - The English. If you want to go by the way shorter, turn left on the camels. with you. Are you afraid of being hit? Alpha has stayed behind. The others are ahead of us. Good. No one will see us take the shortest route. This is beautiful! I wish My father was here. It's time to rest. - What time is it? - Two and a half. But it's only until dawn. - Andrew, wake up. - Are we there yet? What happened? They are gypsies, nomads of the desert, harmless people. They must have been killed before we arrive. But the map said that this was the Po o Chambra. "And they protect the gypsies." - They do not do very well ... Let's get our water. and get out of here. Only 4 days from here to El Jarida and two or three days until arrival. We have to leave soon. - This is Hamancha. - Tribal war started. "The devil's soldiers ..." - Let's go. Let's go! - Can not we do anything? - We just surrender. Him Welcome, Blue Eyes, The land of the Chambra. Leave me alone. Learn, Blue Eyes. Have the honor of being in the tents of my master, the Sheik Ahmed El Jaffar, lord of the sand. I am Ibrahim Rasoul, warrior of the Chambra. And you're my slave. Should have Proud to please me. Take her to my tent. and watch over it. - My master is? - Yes, it is. So let's gather the War Council. It looks like the Swamps are trying to infuriate the Chambra. Chambra can not find out our plans. - Has anyone seen him? - No, but I saw the American car. Some Arabs surrounded him and it seems that there a girl with them. How wonderful! Without the Americans, and us, with two days of travel ... we won for sure. - We still have not won ... We still have half of the Sahara. Get away from me! Uncle! Enough! Stop! I promise, my lord, that she will not bother you again. You tried it once and she burned her tent ... This time, if she resists, I cut her throat. And for a moment of pleasure, will the Legion invade our sand? The French will not dare to interfere. I pray you're right. Take her to the camp. and put it in my tent. No! She's mine. Forget that nothing to you not to be what I say. She's not worth anything. Take her to the tent of my women and watch over her. She how a wild animal. Let's invest against Beg, the murderer of the gypsies. Von Glessing, my friend diabolical, you deceived me. I asked for a war car, And what do you bring me? Precisely what you ordered Now I'll be the thunder in the storm. It's a pleasure to serve a soldier so brave. I will soon more cars, 10, 20, 100 ... If we are dealing with payment, I'm leaving. Kill the goat, join the women and celebrate. No, my indecent friend, I can not. Prayers have to be said and satisfied women, before silver change hands. Let's go to my fortress in my new stud. Down! Withdraw! Withdraw! Good Morning. He recovered of proofs? Who? I am the private servant from Sheikh Ahmed El Jaffar. Let me let you go. English. A crazy Englishman who can not without the midday sun. - Can I help you? - Get me out of here. In the desert, no gua rock. Here I am a slave. Voluntarily I admit, more powerless. Please eat. We do not have poisons nor aphrodisiacs. The food is a present of my master and Lord El Jaffar. This civilized Jaffar? I hope you one day study in my university, Cambridge. Accordingly, also my name I was a teacher l for many years. Your question There is no answer. I have to win a race. Your friends told me of the crazy race, but for you, it ceased to exist. War dominates the sands and Rasoul is his master. - That's what he thinks. - His property. And when he returns, it would be wise appreciate his attempts to seduce her. - Leave him? "More than that." If you become impatient to touch you, maybe he will your death. - You're joking. - No, I'm not. A passionate surrender It's a cheap price to keep these your beautiful head over shoulders. You have embarrassed your father's name. The Chambras do not retreat. Would you rather they died? It's better to be eaten by lions. which tormented by hyenas. Now, the tribes of sand will do little of us. "The storm will pass. - Words ... If the boss, attack, beat me or kill me, but enough of words. Just go everything. I think I should first learn to guide I am sorry for this unfortunate delay, my desert lion, but sure, as soon as the car is in order, you will rule, without doubt, in the desert. As for me, I have to follow my path. I have to win this race. to bring more cars, canh es and maybe even an airplane. This car is yours. That one is mine. That's a ... Very well. You can keep my car. while I repair yours. "The armor serves us both." - And I want him to drive. I'll kill him! Or I'm not Lord Beg. For sure. Let's go. You can pay me later. What are you doing? with my friends? If you do not release them, they die. S Al can decide the hour of death. - What do you want? - I want the girl. - She's mine according to the law ... - It's me. You've embarrassed me today. You will not do it again. - It's done. - It's blood. So she warms up your blood ... At least we found one you like. - Do not touch her. "Tonight will be mine." The law says that mine by right. "Only if I do not marry her." - Do not you dare. She is an infidel, a demon with blue eyes. You should not do that. Take it as my gift, but do not marry her. Tell us that we are at war, and that we can not offer the usual hospitality. Tell them you're leaving. They say they came to see Ayesha, the demon with blue eyes. What a clown thing! Tell them to go to other tribes. Uncle! Gypsies are the source of legends. The shadow of the Chambra their shadow. Blue Eyes has already begun to spread fear in our people. The gypsies will increase it. the law, uncle, and our tradition. Give them a fire, a tent and water. She already knows about the wedding. or are you afraid of her too? You will know. Really beautiful. Do not be afraid. The one who lives in my shadow Enjoy my protection. "What about my friends?" - Also. "Then why do not you set them free?" - They will be released in due time. What does it mean to be? claimed by you? Do you want to ride? It looks like a dream. o O sis Chambra, our secret refuge. The young people of my tribe Come here and bathe before the wedding. A waterfall in the middle of the desert! To lose your breath! You what of losing your breath. Can? I want to thank you for yesterday. you have appeared that way. It saved my life. You need to understand that it was my uncle's right. In the Sahara, a woman without family that protects you belongs to the warrior which to capture.

My father, too. Three years ago. He was magnificent ... the Storm of the Sahara. It's with the stars ... It looks like poetry. They are the customs of the desert. I knew they talk about you. around the campfires? Serious? They say that you an evil power ... Able to possess the soul of a man. And what do you say? You're not. Now our destinations They're just one. I wish we could stay here forever. But we risk our take the shortest route and we are losing the advantage. You should understand what this race means to me. You see? Help me out. - A very lucky woman. - You can talk. But I would not wear this outfit if I wanted to surrender to him. "Surrender to me?" - You do not know? - What? "You should have told him." It's going to be his bride. A very happy change of events. The first woman very auspicious, so get ready and change clothes. Everything has to be perfect. when you come to him.

And you're right. I can not Take this forward! Just as I ruled the sand I rule you. No. Tonight, when the bonfires shine, come to meet me. Please, come to me It worked! Get the stuff! Damn it! - Asshole! - Excuse me! - You're gonna need this. - This is quite unexpected. I never thought she if he surrendered. As soon as I saw her, I believed in the impossible. Go there. Push! Push!
