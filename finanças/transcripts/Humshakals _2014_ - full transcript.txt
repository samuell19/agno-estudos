He's the worst stand-up comedian. I cannot believe how much time I've wasted. He's cracking such pathetic jokes. Who let him in? Okay, I promise you my next joke will make you crack up. I tried writing a letter last night.. ...with a broken pencil. But I just couldn't. You know why? Anyone? Anyone? Anyone? You? No? Because it was pointless. My three own niece cracks better jokes. This guy's jokes are pathetic. Yeah! Okay. Okay. Okay. What did one potato say to another on the phone? 'Aloo' (Potato)! That's rubbish! What do you call a ghost in a telephone? A 'Phone-bhooth' (ghost)! Get out! Shut up! - You suck! And now, one of Amitabh Bachchan's famous dialogue. Ashok, I don't get one thing. Why do you get yourself humiliated every week? Why do you have to do this? It's okay. I'm still a struggling Stand-up Comedian. Struggling? I wish all the strugglers in the world were like you. Ashok. - Yes, Kumar. We've been best friends since second Grade. No one ever laughed on your jokes back then. And still no one does. Take my advice. Stand-up comedy isn't your cup of tea. Then is it my saucer? Look at this. Look at this. This is who you are? You're Ashok Singhania. Your company's worth billions of Dollars. You're such a wealthy man. Why do you need to do standup comedy? Because it's my passion. Anâ€œ AmbanL. In spite of being such a big businessman. He puts on his shorts every year.. ...and runs the marathon like a common man. Why? Because that's his passion. Bill Gates. The king of Computers. But he knits, makes sweaters. Why? Because that's his passion. So chill out, buddy. lam not quitting my business. My bad comedy isn't affecting the Singhania Company shares. We just had a bad day. The next show will be mind-blowing. Come on. You love me, right? Yes. You trust me? Yes. Would I ever take you for a ride? Never. Good. Let's go home. Pilot, take us for a ride. - Oh, Come on! You can't be doing this. - Come on, it's good joke. This is a terrible joke. Good evening, sir. - Good evening, Mishti. How was the show, sir? - Show! The show was fantastic! Much better than last time. This time only 15 people walked out. Because there were only 15 people in the audience. Don't listen to him. I am very happy. In fact, I am so happy.- ...I think I'll give you a raise. Really, sir? - You deserve it, Mishti. You're not just my estate manager.. ...but, you're like a sister to me. But right now, come inside the house man! Baby, I've told you a million times. I don't understand Bengali! Okay! Fine, then this Bengali won't marry you. I love Howrah Bridge. I love Bappi Da. I love Mithun Da. I love Mishti Doi (Curd). I love you, Mishti. Sorry! Come on. Okay. Sir, I need your signature. Thanks. Good evening, sir. Any change in dad's condition? No, sir. Good evening, sir. What's up, dad? What's wrong? You didn't go out today again. Come on, dad. This isn't your age to lie down. You should be playing golf, going clubbing. Handling your business empire. I am not saying that I cannot handle this business empire. It's just that you handle it much better. So get well soon, dad. I miss you. How about a new joke? Ashok. He's already in coma. Bye, dad. Catch you later. If a girl called Sandra is married to a 'Saand' (Bull).. ...can we call her Sandra Bullock. Here we go. Why are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 afraid of 7? AnybOdY- AnybOdY- Because 7 89! 1 a (ate) 9! Let's get out of here. - Ate 9. Ate 9. This really is stand-up comedy. People are standing up and leaving. Okay. If my shoe pops out while I am sneezing.. ...can I say I lost 'A-shoe'. Stop. Stop. Stop. I can't breathe. You're very funny. And you're very beautiful. Thank you for laughing.

Where we randomly pick a common man.. ...from the street and make him a Millionaire for a week. Oh, wow! - Sounds like an interesting concept. It is. From now on I'll never miss this show. So sweet. So, Ashok, when is your next show? When are you free? He'll come and perform. You guys are so witty. And you're so Churchgate. V.T Churchgate. She gets me, man. Really nice to meet you.

Your dreams of taking over can come true.. ...only if Ashok goes in coma, like his father.. ...or loses his mental stability. Khan! I haven't been funding your illegal scientific experiments.. ...all these years so you can lecture me. Why are you telling me what I already know? Because you don't know that.. ...I'm going to fulfill your dreams. With this. MAD. MAD. Mind Altering Drug. Made from samples.. ...of different species of dogs.

Hello. Good morning. - Good morning, sir. Hi. What have you done? What do you mean? I'm only drinking water, uncle. That's Ashok's glass. What difference does it make? Sit. Sit. Sit.

And so..on this wonderful note, let's start the meeting. You'll all be happy to know.. ...that I spoke to Prince Charles yesterday. And he said to me.. Kumar. Are you okay? Are you alright? L..l am sorry. So as I was saying, I spoke to Prince Charles yesterday. On the phone he told me that.. Kumar! What are you doing? Have you gone mad? I'm in a board meeting. Behave yourself. So as I was saying, I spoke to Prince Charles yesterday. And he said to me.. Ashok..Kumar! What are you two doing? Mr. Singh, what is this nonsense. What is happening? I don't know. I don't know. I think we should all go talk to them. Come on, come let's go talk to them. Talk to them. Ashok. Kumar. Ashok. Ashok. Ashok. Ashok. Kumar. Listen. Listen. Open the door somebody. Help. Help me! It's not opening, the door's jammed. Stop! Stop! Sir, I know what's wrong? Shut up, Srinivasan, you're just an accountant. And you also wear a wig. Sir, today's a full moon. Friday the 13th. Saturn's in its fourth eclipse. That's why some people behave like this. If you don't believe me then Goggle it. Four years ago, back in my village.. ...my cousin brother Ramindran.. ...turned to a goat on the same day. What nonsense? No, sir. Really. Lamb. Lamb Shashlik. Then what happened? Nothing, all the villagers were vegetarians. He survived. Get to the point, Srinivasan. Sir, I can handle this sir. I know what to do? Wait. Tommy. Tommy. My cute little doggies. Tommy sir. Tommy.

Where's my hair? I am quitting the job. Sir, I cannot do anything. They are insane, sir. What's going on? Tell us. What's going on? We demand an explanation. I am sorry. - We need to know. Gentlemen, I hid the truth from you all. But the truth is in front of everyone. Ashok and Kumar get such fits. They get fits. Fits? - Fits? What's he talking about? Many doctors tried to treat them. But they have a mental condition. But I promise you, Gentlemen. I'll take them to the best doctors. Try my best to treat them. They cannot be treated, sir. They are insane. They are completely mad. They should be sent to a mental asylum. Yes. They should be thrown in a mental asylum. They are mad people. - Crazy. Sad. Very sad. But don't worry. We'll take complete care. Dr. Shivani is a specialist in such unique cases. Oh, God! Hold them. Don't worry, we'll handle everything. Please come, please come. Come. The end is near! We're all going to die! I still can't believe this. A rich man like Ashok Singhania.. ...In our mental asylum, and in this condition. Doctor, no one should find out about this? Yes, of course, Mr. Singh. You don't worry. You can rely on our discretion. - Thank you. Doctor, why's there a fence.. ...and such high-security here? That's Ward-B of our mental facility. Mental patient's jail. Jail? - Yes. You see, Ward-A is a mental hospital. Ward-B a jail for mental patients. The UK government sent.. ...different types of criminally insane inmates here.. ...who have no chance of improving. Oh, I see. A jail for the insane. - Exactly. But what do we care? They don't know what happens in Ward-A. And we don't know what happens in Ward-B. But we do know one thing. Their jailor is just as crazy as they are. Anyway, I'll take your leave. Nice meeting you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. - Bye.. You said the effects of your drug will wear off in 24 hours. And then those two will be normal. What do we do then? - Relax. I've made arrangements for that. There's a ward-boy inside on my payroll. Every morning he'll keep giving them that drug. Then no one can save them. Good morning Doctors. Please sit down. Doctors, welcome to B-Wing of Lord Cray G Mental Asylum's.. ...on this Educational Tour. I am Dr. Ashok. And this is my colleague Dr. Kumar. The mental patients here are very dangerous. So we request all of you.. ...to give your mobile phones, chains.. ...and all other valuables to us. Just for safety. Only as long as the tour doesn't end. Keep all your belongings here. We'll keep this in a safe-deposit locker. Be seated here. We'll be back. Day-light robbery. Boys and girls, you all are a part of day-light robbery. I am the warden of this institution. Y.M. Raj. But for people like them I am Yamraj (Lord of Death). They are no doctors. They are old patients who are insane themselves. Hi. - Hello. And they are here to rob you. No, no, no We weren't robbing them. We were just joking. Only joking. Shut up you mad people. We aren't mad. - We're just a little crazy. Oh, then I'll fix it, right? Here we go. No! No! No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No! No! No! Oh God! Shock. Electric. Electric shock. Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Stop it! Electric shock. Oh God! Oh God! Stop it! Oh God! Sir, what just happened inside? And who are these two? You're new here. So you don't know these two. They are Ward-B's most adorable patients. This is Ashok, and that's Kumar. Even if they would have half a brain each.. ...they would still end up having only half a brain. But what happened to them watching electricity? These two were small-time thieves. They used to make Paratha (stuffed bread).. ...South Hall Don Karan T Bijlani's 'Paratha' stall. Bijlani sir, why did you get more flour? We already have more than enough. This isn't flour, its cocaine. Cocaine. Cocaine in a flourjar? Don't irritate me. This is a 'Paratha' stall. If I keep this cocaine in the flour jar.. ...everyone will think it's flour. These days the narcotics department are on a high-alert. Keep it carefully. I've taken full advance from the party. Don't worry, boss. Your job..will be done. Why are you winking? Don't worry, boss. As you sow.. so shall you reap. You winked again. Don't make it so obvious. Go inside. Hello and welcome to 'Kaun Banega Millionaire'. I am your host and friend Shanaya. One common man that I choose on this show.. ...will get the opportunity to live the life of a millionaire. For a week. Oh my, God! That lucky contestant will get big cars, exotic manors. In short, all the luxuries.. ...which only a millionaire gets. Are you a millionaire? No way. I am a student. Would you like to be a millionaire? Of course, who wouldn't? Perfect. So you're selected on 'Kaun Banega Millionaire'. Kumar, you're watching that rubbish TV show again. Quiet! Don't you dare call this show rubbish. I'm a big fan of this girl. Just watch. Some day this girl will choose us.. ...and make us a millionaire. Stop dreaming. Customers are waiting. If you don't start making 'Parathas' soon.. ...then we'll certainly be out on the streets. Where's the flour? There's no flour. Where's the flour? Flour! Flour! Flour! That day the customers ate 'Cocaine parathas'. Potato paratha, Cauliflower paratha, Radish paratha.. ...and with all that they got coke free. Wow, your 'parathas' are in a big demand today. It's not me, it's this miraculous flour. The flour was over. So I used the flour kept below in this jar. What happened? - What have you done? Why? - That wasn't flour. Then? - That was Bijlani's cocaine. You made cocaine parathas. Look. Look. Bijlani gave them electric shocks.. ...and it completely ruined the chemical balance in their brain. Their mental age started reducing.. ...and became like children. Oh, God! Shocks. We're getting shocks. Whenever they see electric current, they get fits. You can say that, they had the body of a man.. ...but the brain of a kid. Poor guys. Good morning. No, it's good afternoon. It's lunchtime. 12 o'clock. Our clocks stopped ticking long back. 12 o'clock? - Yes. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Why do you always take such a risk at lunchtime? If that warden catches us, he'll torture us to death. I am ready to endure every beating, every torture. Because she's worth it. I love her. If you love her then why don't you tell her? And what do I tell her? Tell her.. We are caught! That you're a doctor for the insane and I am the king of the mad men. Let's fall madly in love. Right? Right? Don't feel shy. I say you jump over the wall and say it right now. I insist. Please. Or else you'll see my dead face. Go on. - Come on. Go on. - Thank you. Come on. - How dare you? Come down. Come down. If this was my uncle Hitler's Germany.. ...I would've put you two in a gas chamber.. ...and used my personal gas on you two. Mad fellows. We are not mad. We're just a little crazy. Catch them. "We are spoilt, madcap barons." "Read us, for we are open books." "We are like bread as well as like butter." "We aren't insane, brother." "We've simply lost our minds." "We aren't insane, brother." "We've simply lost our minds." "Seeing us gives rise to only this question." "Does the fish have a black spot or is the fish black?" "This is a mint that makes fake coins." "We aren't insane, brother." "We've simply lost our minds." "We aren't insane, brother." "We've simply lost our minds." "We became notorious, we became eminent too." "From our dear ones we are alienated, alienated, alienated." "Our hearts were murdered, and tortured too." "Grief has crushed us, crushed us, crushed us." "Oh, my partner. Oh my partner." "Oh my partner, a rose has bloomed in my barren garden on seeing you." "We aren't insane, brother." "We've simply lost our minds." "We aren't insane, brother." "We've simply lost our minds." Excuse me. Why are you showing us this bone? And why have we been kept in this mental asylum? And in strait jackets. Do we look insane? Sir.. - Do you know who I am? I am Ashok Singhania. If these strait jackets aren't taken off immediately.. ...I'll sue you and your mental institution for Millions of Pounds. Yes. Please calm down. - No, you calm down. Untie us immediately. Fine. Ward-boy, take them away. What ward-boy. - Take them away. Okay, one second. One second. We're calm, okay. See. Alright. - Please release them. Fast - Thank you. Let's talk like civilized people. I'll just ask you some questions. Can we start? Yes. What's the last thing you two remember? Yesterday we were in a board meeting. - Yes. I was presenting something. And then.. After that we opened our eyes and.. We were here. In the mental asylum. In strait jackets. Amazing. Temporary memory loss. Patients don't remember when they turned into dogs. I just.. I am sorry, what did you say? When you turned into dogs? Dogs? 'Dogs. Dogs! What rubbish are you talking? I am serious. Yesterday, you two were behaving like dogs. Oh God. - She called us dogs again. If we're dogs then..you're a cat. You're a lizard. - You're a 'Chamgadad'. What's a 'Chamgadad'? - It's a bat "Batman." Yeah! You're a 'Gamchadad'. - That's 'Chamgadad'. Yes, whatever. You're that too. You're the entire zoo. Ward-boy, take them both away. - Okay, no. Listen, listen. Sorry. We're calm. We're okay. Ma'am, I think they need some water. Yeah, please give them. Drink some water. Look, doctor. We're telling you for the last time. Politely. We're not dogs. Stop them. Close the gates. Stop them. Let me go. Inspector, this is public harassment. Your dog sniffed my entire car. He even peed on my backseat. But he didn't find any drugs. Now can I go please? Alright, you can go. Thank you. Thank you. Ashok, Kumar, why are you two.. ...barking and sniffing like a dog? Why are you barking on me? lam Karan T Bijlani. What are you looking for inside? What are you sniffing for? Drugs! Officer, these drugs aren't mine. - Well done. This isn't my car either. I came in a taxi. Let's go. Ashok and Kumar, I won't spare you two? Oh my, God! How could we make such a big mistake, Shivani? Sir, Ashok and Kumar were telling the truth. They've been conspired against. Someone wants to make them insane. That's why our ward-boy was drugging them. And what did the ward-boy say.. ...when you confronted him? Sir, he isn't saying a thing. We should call the police. - Police? No, no, no, Shivani. Look, we can deal with the ward-boy later. But if we go to the police.. ...then Ashok Singhania will sue us. He'll shut down this hospital. Yeah! - Let's do one thing. Tell Ashok and Kumar that they're being released.. ...because they are cured. They are cured. And don't listen to them at all. Just get them out of here anyway. In fact, release them right now. - Not now, sir. They are still dogs. They will bite me. In the morning when they turn back into humans I will let them go. Okay. It's empty- Where's my doctor? Doesn't she come during lunchtime? Today is Valentine's Day. I've brought a gift for her. An apple a day keeps the doctor away. Nobody can keep her away from me, okay. I'm going over to Ward-A. I'll see her face to face and give her this gift. You come along too. It will only take a minute. We'll just go there, give her the gift and come back. Okay? Only two minutes. Two minutes. Come on! Come on. Ashok, just calm down. - What calm down? Thank God you're discharging us today. Otherwise my lawyers would've shutdown this institution forever. Forget it, we're going out anyway. Come, sir. Please come, sir. Wait here for a while, I'll get your discharge papers. What papers? Listen, you release us immediately. Sir. - Enough is enough. Sir, paperwork is important.

But last night, I brought them back to the asylum.. ...with the help of the warden. Then tell me something you rascal. What are those two doing in garden right now? What? I mean they are right here. But how's that possible? They are right before my eyes in the asylum's B-wing. What nonsense. Honestly. Come and see for yourself. What? What are you blabbering? Those two are here? Do you know what they've done to me at home? They buttered my face. What.. Uncle! Ashok. Thank God you're here. What's happening with us? Why are we in a mental asylum? And..we were released. So why are we being kept here? Ashok. Kumar. lam so sorry about all this. This..is certainly the doing of our rival companies. But you two don't worry. I will do my best to get you two out of here. And when I find out who drugged your glasses.. ...during the board meeting, I won't spare him. I will get you two out of here at any cost, okay. I'll be back. Uncle.

Caught me! Caught me! Caught me! Finally you two saw my true colors. But..look at the irony of life. I am the one that's caught red-handed.. ...and you two are behind bars. Yes, I dosed you with that drug. And that drug was prepared by Dr. Khan. He's a big rascal.. ...Kunwar Amar Nath Singh. KANS. (mythological villain) So how can you expect any goodness from him? In the next board meeting.. ...I'll be the new boss of Singhania Group of Industries. And you..will officially handover the entire property to me. Now you'll ask how. We have your look-alikes. And right now.. ...they are at your house. And it's no rocket science to understand.. ...that they are the real mental patients. And you're being held here in their place. You know what I mean. Two Double roles. And coincidently, do you know what their names are? Ashok..and Kumar! Now..I'm going to use those stupid doubles.. ...and seize the entire property.

Do you know Balbir? No, aunt. You're mistaken. He isn't Balbir, that's their uncle Kans. If he's Kans.. then you're Shrupnakha(Demoness). How long have I been your housemaid? Ten years. Have I ever lied? But.. - I said that's my nephew Balbir, then that's Balbir. Aunt, I am sorry..but, are you sure? Look at them. How dare you doubt me? You two are in the photo too, so why ask me?
