Lady Arkati! It's a juggling trick I told you she was a fraud This is a shameful accusation! I simply lost touch (Charles) was right, it was a pre-made trick where did he go? Please! Please! Mrs. Arkati has just had a very painful experience Please, just... please Listen, I ask you to respect her privacy At this difficult time Oh my God! I told you, Mandip. I don't want to see a creature My name is Charles Condomin. I am an award-winning writer - especially scandal journalism I am not a reporter I write crime novels Scripts and movies I cannot stand the novel or the fiction Get out Mrs. Arkati? I am not here to doubt your integrity Making a strange accent does not mean that your talent is not real I fully understand that it is like I am Sometimes you have to use... An artistic license to keep the crowd entertained They expect me to do a big show And a super miracle... night after night Of course, there is no need to justify yourself I am a believer I'm here simply to invite you to have a private séance in my home I'm not a traveling banjo player, Mr. Condomin. I am not fulfilling the demands Well, some influential guests might attend This can be a good opportunity to push back bad publicity One of the unfortunate events of the night When would you like the session to take place? as soon as possible So I suggest this Thursday Midsummer Night Summer Solstice The turning point of the Holy Seasons Excellent - “The Great Lady (Arkatti)” - I told her of my deepest interest Anything related to esoteric matters - And it blossomed like a flower - Hassan, host an evening with a professional charlatan - Sounds like a great pastime - doesn't it? But will it bring you closer to finishing your film? I need the old woman to show me some of the secrets of the profession - This is what will make my new hero truly unique - and what is so unique about him? - He's dead. - Dead? He was filled with death He is the victim of a brutal, unsolved murder And he communicates with the living through a spiritual medium It helps bring back people from the other world Maybe it can revive your career at the same time My father is ready to fight and he threatens to find another writer If you didn't deliver the text soon is anybody there? is anybody there? One click to answer And two for negation Is that you, Maya? Who is Maya? My guiding spirit She was breastfeeding (Tutankhamun) I really hope you are not producing milk yet I ask you not to be arrogant, Doctor Bradman. Perhaps she is in the Kingdom of Shambhala, but the woman still has feelings Please forgive me, Mrs. Arctati. I didn't mean to offend is anybody there? There is... Object... Or someone... from here? Now we are making progress Do I want to talk to her? Is it Doctor Bradman? Or maybe one of his less fortunate patients? Is it Mrs. Bradman? Is it Mrs. Condomine? Act polite, Maya. Is it Mr. Condomin? Seems someone wants to talk to you, Mr. Condomin. Do you know someone who died recently? And my old literary agent only But it is very unlikely that he will communicate with me He owes me a fortune of copyright Are you the literary agent of Mr. Condomin? No I fear we failed to get an answer Is there a dead person you think about often? Well, there's no other choice I would have to go into a coma This is a moment I hate Are you... are you nervous or... When I was a child I was sick Now let's see, what do we have here? Music by (Brahms) No, it's melancholy and frustrating (Rakhmaninov) No, he's very elaborate No, that's better Always' Should that song be? Maya loves a melody that she can chime on, too I will love you always' "Always true love" And the things you are planning "Need a helping hand" "I will always understand."

She's going through a seizure of some kind Please do something, Doctor Bradman. thank God! what happened? Except that the glass doors opened in a storm, nothing supernatural Something great happened - I can feel it in my basement - it might be a flatulence There are no evil spirits anyway Are there spectra? We didn't see any of it What about ectoplasm? I'm not quite sure what that is Thick essence of nature It seeps from one's body in a spiritual trance Matter is formed for the manifestation of spirits No, I would definitely remember that Well, I should go before the storm hits Could you have some refreshment before returning to your hotel? No, thank you, Mrs. Condomin. I like to travel lightweight Congratulations, Mrs. (Arkati). It was an exciting evening I'm fully aware of the irony in your voice, Doctor Bradman. Do I have the courage to remind you? Modern medicine is a new phenomenon And that the doctors found health In practices that cannot be explained scientifically Since the beginning of civilization - good words Good good night everyone Sorry, not much happened in the end Cosmic flow may be the cause Thank you very much for agreeing to do this, Mrs. Arctati. It was an educational evening on several levels Thank you Mister Condomin Good bye She... you might hear us I can't, really... I can't (The Olden Arch Hotel) Talismans and talismans I can't quite understand it, Donald. I have never experienced anything like it in my life It really felt like... Something big has happened Well... maybe next time Goodnight my love Did you get everything you needed for your script? Everything and more You don't even think about going to sleep, do you? What? Wouldn't it be wise to start writing the ideas while they're still fresh? Yeah, No. Certainly I'll... get a drink for myself And I start working Take the chance, my dear take the chance "Always, always" "Always, always" 'Modern woman' Gosh! (Charles) What have you done? The room looks like a huge Beach Melba dessert plate Where did my Italian wealthy go? What? Gosh! Gosh! Hello Please tell me that you didn't destroy the rest of the house No No! Moroccan mosaic decorations (Charles)! I miss one weekend It stripped the whole house of life and spirit! It can't be happening I must be babbling Judging from the decor I would say that it is the least eloquent statement of this century I should have known that you are not responsible for this Who is she? - It's not what you think - please Do not underestimate me or yourself any more If you have something to tell me, be a man And say it quickly (Elvira)... You are dead how dare you! 'Modern woman' The last thing I remember... It is to compete in the steeplechase race in the Southern Downs It is true The conditions were treacherous And as you do with a lot of things, I refused to listen to the logic Well, I couldn't afford to miss the season's most high-profile match, Charles. You paid the highest price for your patronage and fell at the last wall Knock your neck straight The whole incident was very heartbreaking for all of the participants Well, I suppose it wasn't so heartbreaking for them as it was for me They actually renamed Horse Jumping after your name O good consideration! I don't understand, if I am dead then how am I here and why? I totally have no idea Maybe you are a ghost What? - No - no! - Please don't act hysterically Rather anxious is the most accurate expression Procrastination is a waste of time, Charles. And your time... is running out Who is she? My wife Ruth - Yeah, are you okay? I'm your wife - Not anymore - Why? what's the problem? I'm not talking to you, Ruth, I'm talking to Elvira. Elvira? Yeah, you can definitely see her standing right next to you What mess are you doing, Charles? Elvira is dead! Did everyone keep saying that? I introduce you to Ruth, dear Elvira, I introduce you to Elvira, my dear Ruth. - Are you drunk? - Elvira is here with us in the room, Ruth. Mrs. Arkati must have brought her up during the session Mrs. Arkati is a rogue, you yourself said that I'll go to bed I suggest you sleep too We'll finally have some time alone to get to know each other again This is an unethical proposition in every sense of the word I didn't hint for a moment until we shared the bed - No... - I learned to accept your impotence When performing in that area I can't imagine what I did with that grim Shut up You're acting like street kids - your behavior is unforgivable, Charles. good night Hurrah! What a scary woman! I can only assume it was a marriage of counselor I've gone mad This is the reality Completely insane The drink will ruin your life if you allow it to take over One last time, Ruth, last night had nothing to do with drinking I was not pissed at all Something very strange happened to me It was a one-time delirium, likely caused by work stress The deadline does not explain why you told me when I quietly proposed to you to sleep With Shazer's loveliest look, it was an unethical suggestion I thought I was talking to elvira. Well, if you are then I can only say that it creates a good picture of your first marriage My first marriage was charming in every sense of the word It is very infuriating to mock him You are not as interested in your first marriage as you might think Your second marriage is actually what currently occupies me It is heading towards failure Okay, your pressure is 155 over 99 It is really high I am not surprised given the extent of the delirium I really thought Elvira was in the room talking to me It was true to my destiny and your destiny Maybe you'd better stop taking the tablets, my dear friend My dear I hate to see you so upset Please accept my sincere apologies Anything annoying I could have said last night Or this morning I accept your apologies Let's not mention it again how are you? Yes, I think Doctor Bradman might solve the mystery - Well, thanks to Heaven - Now... Let's go see your dad I want to make sure he likes my new idea before I put it down on paper I don't want to be late Pinewood Studios Rank Organization, Pinewood Studios (Charles) This is how you see, Henry, that it is only through a spiritual medium The killer can be brought to justice Based on new evidence collected from the other world - "You should wait at the red light" - I like the assumption, Charles. But not so much that I wait another 6 months to see a text Charles will deliver the text in a few weeks, Dad I promise you Me too - Stop filming - we stop it Yes, let's go and see the next scene I think (Hitchcock) would be the perfect director for our movie Just do not approach him in a way that interferes with his work Come on, dear Nice to see you, my dear Googy. Introducing you to Charles Condomin. I like your books, Mr. Condomin. When can we expect Detective Flowers to resolve his next case? In fact, Charles made the leap to scriptwriting - My father's help - what an exciting thing! I yearn to play one of your strong-willed female characters Where do you get inspiration from? Where do you think? What a romantic thing... to marry your muse It's not very romantic to replace your muse Why don't you tell her the truth, Charles? You are a dreamer, married to two women - shut up Stop acting like a prostitute I beg your pardon? Admit it, Charles. Your female characters are all based on me I was always a proverb who only took care of herself How dare you talk to the main heroine like this? no no no Get hold of yourself, Charles, what's going on? (Elvira) Here I can see it It's right there I insist that you go home right away and lie down I have no desire to go to bed in the middle of the afternoon How surprising things have changed! I remember a time when we could barely get ourselves out of our double sofa Stop behaving with immorality and get away from my face - How dare you speak my daughter like this! - No, I wasn't talking to her Exit my site to shoot You are in trouble now Don't be boyish - I'll give you childish behavior does it hurt? - Only if I breathe - let me see it, dear what about now? Gosh! I suggest you take yourself to your office The only way for Dad to forgive you is to hand over an Oscar-worthy script. How am I supposed to write in this case? - You better try Either you start typing and prove you're not crazy Or I'll be forced to call Dr. Bradman. I request a referral to a neurologist dung)! I am not nervous at all - And I never was - Hassan, so psychoanalyst I refuse to endure months of costly indignity just to be told by the doctor at its end At the age of 4 I was in love with my rocking horse Don't use that rough tone with me, Charles Condomin. I am not the one who started to see fantasies Then you believe me I don't believe you of course there is no such thing as a ghost or ghoul I summon (donald keeling) Second Lieutenant... In the 92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Battalion And who died on February 27 From 1881 In battle (Majuba Hill) Progress Show yourself to me now (Cecily)... Your faithful wife always (Donald) Is that you? I'm from room service Do you need new towels? What are you doing here? Even though you removed every trace of me this is still my home On top of that, I don't have a clue how to get back even if I wanted to Are you saying you'll stay indefinitely? Why? I really hate it if I did? Honestly, Charles, I'm really a little bit hurt You are the only one who could have brought me back And I absolutely did not ask you to come, Elvira. Ruth and I are about to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary together five? - What is the classification of the fifth anniversary? leather? Wood Beware of splinters Lady (condominium) I'll call Doctor (Bradman) and see if he'll accompany us to the sanatorium Please hear me, Ruth. I didn't go crazy The ghost of my first wife (elvira) Across from the other world - He's with us in the room now. - Yeah, dear I know, I see it quite clearly Accompanied by zebras and chimpanzees hiding under a piano. I've always considered you, Ruth, a woman of insight and understanding me too But if you say you are not drinking then something is definitely squeezing your brain Please do something to reveal that you are really here, Elvira. She will admit me to a sanatorium Do you remember when we first heard our song, Charles? I will love you always' Have you seen? what did I say to you? It's a damaging trick, Charles, to use some kind of... Self-suggestion or hypnosis to scare me not like that! I swear it isn't! My dear! My dear (Elvira) Do something else for the sake of God I will do anything to help See Gosh! Farewell, intruder Whew! Exposing a fraudulent spiritual medium I fear we want to reclaim the room I told you I would pack my bags and be ready to leave in an hour Thank God I caught up with you You are my only hope Something terrible happened I heard a strange noise at night? Cockroach plates? And the doors clap? A pent-up moan in the hallways? No, nor any of those things But it seems that after the session... My husband's first wife (elvira) That died 7 years ago - It's back in our midst - finally! Real embodiment I knew something very powerful had happened to me that night I feel it in the outer layer of my spinal cord After all these years of... of spiritual devotion I finally got my reward I value your pride in your achievement But I like to point out that it makes my place in my home loose I hold you fully responsible Forgive me, Mrs. Condomin. I act despicably selfish Just so things are clear in my mind You yourself did not see this revelation? No But (Charles) claims he can see and talk to her Well, if the emotional connection is strong, that is sometimes possible What? It can develop at times... To the tenth level It is something I have never even dared dream of Can he in any way... touch her? I sincerely hope he can't Why? Could this happen? If the returning spirit feels welcome It can gradually become... Physically realistic Thank you, Mrs. Bradman. Please let me know if you hear anything from her It is not there either I remember when you couldn't wait to spend afternoon alone with me Please refrain from manipulating my emotions so I feel weird enough You still find me attractive then Please, Elvira. This is inappropriate talk Look in my eyes And tell me you no longer love me I will always love you Memories belong to the past, Charles. But here I am And this is the present Why not take out the boat like we used to We breathe in some air I can't... I have a deadline what are you writing? Checks? I inform you that I am assigned the task of converting my first novel into a script Your first novel? I put all my energy into writing this story on paper Let's face it dear It is no coincidence that you have not published a word since my death I will not deny it, you had a certain talent for writing plots - And the characters - and...? - And dialogue - yeah Your biggest problem is that the turning point into Chapter 3 is not exciting enough This is why you do not have a satisfactory peak Tell me what I don't know Wouldn't he be smarter? Turn it upside down And disclosure of the husband as the killer? - That's good - or maybe more interesting... It is for the wife to plot against him Why would a wife send her husband to the gallows? - It's clear, dear (Susan Rutherford) becomes the main suspect When the argument does not prove its absence And we assume, of course, that she is trying to protect the reputation of the foreign minister Whose ambitions to become prime minister will be severely undermined If he exposed news that he was having a relationship But in reality that is far from the truth It is what we know from the victim himself It is only through a spiritual medium that they can find a solution Find a solution to what? - to the problem that she is pregnant Papen of the dead foreign minister thats good! - Well, I didn't even expect that to happen - of course you didn't, dear You're just the writer I'm afraid, Mrs. Condomin. It is time for me to really honestly admit I have no idea how to return it I have my own personal reasons for wishing to communicate with the departed But I never thought for a second Chances are I will have to return one of them Well, I suggest you find a way I refuse to share my husband with anyone Especially his dead ex-wife Well, if I thought for a moment that your husband He wanted to connect with the soul of his dead ex-wife I would have consulted you first, of course, in the end... Nobility dictates that I can assure you that he had no intention of communicating with her He planned the whole thing in order to get material for his new project Do I understand from your words You both called me in a spirit of irony? He simply wanted to take a few notes about... trade secrets Trade secrets! - I have never felt such offense in my life - sorry if I put it the wrong way I... I'm actually troubled by the whole relationship Please, I plead with you to help us I will go to the Spiritual Pact On my way back to Sussex And ask them for guidance (Sussex)! You cannot abandon us in our time of need I can no longer afford to stay here because of my recent circumstances But you can contact me I can cover the hotel bill and any other expenses Until we find a solution to this horrific calamity Susan Rutherford leans towards the Secretary of State - Don't stop - "(The Soviet Union) can wait." Says the Foreign Minister He turns around and looks at Susan with eagerness "As for this, he cannot wait." Urgent speed whisper Then... it starts slowly... Unbuttoning her silk blouse While they start kissing each other romantically Well, that brings us to the first tipping point - You can't stop in the middle of the flow - I'm tired And thirsty And I want to go into town and drink (Negroni) like we used to But... but the time was late I really became content with staying home overly, Charles. (The Savoy) Inspiration Price "It would be very loud." "If we are and in order to stimulate my creativity" "We are forced to say goodbye to each other" If you're going to start writing Sing with a song - “Nothing has a rhythm...” - What do you want, Elvira? I want? Yes I do not know what you mean I remember when you were overwhelmingly sober That usually meant you wanted something It was an abomination for you to be suspicious All I want is to be alone with you Can't be denied, I feel a little strange to see you again I miss you more than life itself I missed you too... Oh my American dream I was completely heartbroken after the accident And the truth is, I don't think I have really recovered from your loss Do you love Ruth? Of course I love it As much as you loved me? Don't be silly It's completely different I am very happy Nothing can ever be like our relationship, can it? Let's go to soho And we exchange sandals for dance shoes "You should give a little." "And take a little" And let your poor heart break a little. "That is the story of..." "That's the greatness of love." "You have to laugh a little." "And cry a little." Let the clouds recede a little. "That is the story of..." "That's the greatness of love." - “As long as we are together” - Hold on! - “We own the whole world and its magic” - I think I'll puke, my God! - “And when the world ends with...” - (Charles) I like to get back to driving a car I can't say the feeling is mutual (Charles) where have you been? I worried about you to the point of illness It was very unfortunate that it was not an incurable disease I wanted to clear my mind so I went for a long drive in the car In the passenger seat? Listen, let's not argue when we should party I finished the first chapter of the script and it's... - And it's actually good - the more correct it is me How did you do that in a day? - Elvira helped me - You mean to tell me She didn't just return herself to the threshold with bullying And even trying to work with you now too? What do you mean by "trying"? I wrote 15 books in your name This is neither the right place nor the right time, Elvira. This is unbearable Elvira! Listen to me... My dear? - I... yes? She is there Hassan And now, listen, Elvira. I went to see Mrs. Arcati and she will take you back... Unfortunately, to the place I dragged you from (Charles) (Charles) do not do Please don't be upset, my dear resent? You spent the night with your ex What do you expect me to be feeling? Fly with joy Our dream of going to (Hollywood) is finally within our grasp As soon as I hand over the script, we will be crossing the Atlantic Faster than you say, Sunset Boulevard. Think about flashiness And magic And the good times we will share You will not read about other people's lives anymore You will read about our life And you can't do that without her? Of course I can But it would be much faster in this mode You really don't need to be jealous You are the one I love Forgive me for not telling you that enough Since the words are flowing now I feel... I'm free in other respects, too Assure me that you cannot touch it My dear... She is a ghost Plus the only woman I want to touch is you Listen to me, lady You may have brought me into this world But it is impossible for me to allow you to send me from here again I came to stay is this clear?

And doom get up! get up! Get up and get up What have you been me, Charles? Warm-up part? If I were you I would keep it in its place - Good evening, madam. - I must correct you, Edith.

Wizard If only I were to compose a character with beauty Equilibrium and idealism (Ruth) My fans will accuse me of straying into my imagination But fortunately we are all here today Let's celebrate the fact that Ruth is a real It was also an amazing 5 years So let's stand up... stand up Let's raise our cups to toast... true love - Toast of true love - toast of true love - Toast of true love - toast of true love never Dies I wish I could shrug like my sister Kate. She can shake like jelly on a plate. "My mom wanted you to know last night." Why did the guys treat all of them (Kate) so kindly? "All the young men in the neighborhood know that she can shrug her shoulders" "You may be late, but you will be fashionable" When you can shrug your shoulders like sister Kate... yeah Shrug your shoulders like my sister Kate. I went to a dance party with my sister Kate. And everyone thought it was amazing. - “I looked for something new” - O Mighty Lord! - What are you doing, Ruth? - I cool down - Dancing made me feel hot and sweaty - "Then I knew the secret to her dance" - “Everyone has gone mad” - everyone is looking I didn't know it was going to be one of those parties - “Like my sister Kate” - You're so wet - What happened to your dress? - What happened to your dress, Dad? everybody! - Yes, that's beautiful, honey I'm not sure the fish are enjoying it Why don't you go upstairs and lie down a little? I will only go if you are going to join me Establish a relationship with me as if it were the first time What? Does Mister Beasbody want to go out and have fun? I am not surprised that she does not want to establish a relationship and the lights are a beacon - Don't be vulgar, Elvira. - Is she in the room? Listen now, you cheap bitch This is my party and my bedroom My home and... (Charles) my husband is me what did she say? - I apologized without reservations And she went back downstairs You should have been an actor, Charles. You're pretty good my dear... Sorry Charles, I just... I'm no longer in the mood for that I'm in the right mood Good morning my dear You look exhausted Yeah, I had a slightly thinner night Yes Yeah, it felt like you were a little flustered I made Edna bring you herring, Norfolk. - Your favorite - that's so cute A heavy meal would help me I am afraid yesterday drinking too much The party passed... a little foggy - What is the word that you stuck with? Number 22 is vertical Greek goddesses Seven letters, the third letter (M) and the seventh letter (S) (Nemesis) What happened? She said the place was damned - Not safe, not safe at all - (Edna)! - You can't leave us - you can keep your job I'm getting out of here Get away! - Stop it, Edna. Leave me Get away! - Stay tuned, Edna... please! Keep this job to yourself Here you are! Here you are! Now... to work Yes where are you? where are you? "Detective, I cannot understand how you can blame a girl." "To love the right person" "For the wrong reasons" But what about your poor, frail husband? There are many more like him. "What was he? The right person in the wrong place and time?" "Detective... just because of your proximity..." "I feel as though I'm completely naked." "How do you always see my truth?" "I see things exactly as they are." "The rest of the world needs glasses." Not sure the last line I feel is... very flashy I want something simple and straightforward like... "This is my job, honey." "I'm just doing it" Do as you like your name written on the text And the gradual transition to a black screen Hassan... I dare say the movie would be better than the book We also finished it before the deadline Just wait until I tell ruth. Let's not tell it now For the Lord's love! Miserable! Curse! - Are you all right, honey? Knowing that you are finding it at work It made it easier for me to withstand a few blisters and burns Strong spirits emanate from suffering, my dear I am afraid I have nothing to offer for lunch Don't worry about that, please, I'm not hungry at all Do I dare ask how the writing works? - The finish line is almost within sight - thank God! I never like to be alone with her But... if that means you will be able to deliver the text I can be lenient on that You and I are already a successful team, my dear I want us to get our beds back together permanently I think if we were to be apart during the day The least we can do is... That we spend nights together as husband and wife Nothing I desire more than this I'm going out I will try to clear my mind "Salt" "eggs" Do you remember when we were playing hide and seek here? And your reward when you find me? Look! Isn't it handsome? It is adorable He can sense my presence How wonderful it is to not be afraid of the unknown You're not terrified, are you, Charles? - What? To love again How is that possible when we are in two different ranks? - I am alive and you... - Don't Don't say it I'm so sorry, Elvira, there's no easy way to say this I strive to see a future that brings us together Do you know me, Charles? When you give someone an eternal ring It should be love that will last forever Charles? Beware, Charles! Curse! It's dangerous, Charles. Edna's head was almost peeled off Look at what happened to Edith. What do you suggest? It's very clear that Elvira is here For one goal and one goal only She came here to have you forever How? - By killing you, of course This is ridiculous Do you really think the locker climbed to the roof and jumped on its own? Maybe Elvira is prone to tantrums But she still loves me She never wishes me harm If you are dead... That would be her last victory over me She'll have you for herself in her Animal Dreamy Rank And I will be helpless Maybe she's planning a spiritual second marriage of sorts what shall we do? Yes, the inmate's name is Mrs. Arkati. Room No. 14 - One moment - Sorry, but she left yesterday - I got it - Did you leave any messages? - I'm afraid she didn't Thank you I left the hotel yesterday Well, I have no other choice. I have to get the police to arrest me - I spent the night locked up in a cell - No. We just have to find our safe place at night Yes Let's pick them carefully now My valuable one Herba venereus Protect the sacred nature What are you doing with this? I just removed all the heavy and sharp objects to the point I thought you could follow along with your text while we're in hiding here I originally finished I thought you said you were suffering When I thought deeply, I found that I was overthinking it I will read the text quickly - And drop him off at the studio in the morning - Charles! What a great news! Dad will fly from happiness - As I feel - Thank you, dear We can now focus on making Elvira permanently forgotten And it's just the right time Loving two and three is a nightmare I almost finished Man pigeons and dill Hold the witches from their resolve (Charles) (Charles) Hey, Mrs. Condomin. I have news - "Telephone" - the doors open and change is near This is not the time for mysteries, Mrs. Arctati. We were trying to contact you urgently Charles' life is in great danger (Elvira) trying to kill him I fear it might turn out to be a mischievous soul That's a nice expression of it where are you? - in (Sussex) I put it all together and I'm ready now for anything? - In order to return it of course Stay in your place, Mrs. Arctati, I will come to get you The phone woke me up I apologize if I scared you When mister condomine wakes up, Tell him I went to get Mrs. Arkati and that I'll be back before lunch Mrs. Arkati... before... I beg you not to hurt me Are you all right on the inside, Mr. Condomin? I never stopped loving you I don't know what to say, sir You have a weird way of showing that up, Charles. I was going to put your name on the text Before I hand it over this morning, believe me That would not be necessary, sir I am a woman, Charles. We are used to not receiving the recognition we deserve No, I insist, I will change my clothes and leave immediately The condomine left in the car some time ago She said she would be back at lunchtime What have you done, Elvira? What a mistake! "There are things I cannot control." "Like the wind" "And rain" And snow 'I completely take over' "On my soul" "There are things I cannot control." "You make summer" "It lasts all days of the year." 'One glimpse of you' And the clouds disappear. "Like the forces of nature" We were destined to be here. "And now this flame is in my heart." Burning for you "There are things I cannot control." "As time goes by" And the successive chapters 'I completely take over' "On my soul" "There are things I cannot control." Mr (condominium) I would say I reproach myself bitterly You're not to blame, Mrs. Arctati. The guilt is on my shoulders in all fairness My ambition and my ego They are what dragged us into this unbearable mess And this is something I will have to live with for the rest of my life The last time I spoke to Mrs. Condomin. Your life was in danger I urge you to come to meet me at your earliest convenience Here's my card I will be waiting Wouldn't you stay for refreshments? Please don't think I'm a rude, but I'm... I prefer to see the transition of a soul In my own way My condolences, mister condominium. Shouldn't you be congratulated? What are you doing here? Are you not ashamed? It was an accident, Charles. I was trying to kill you How can you be so hard-hearted? Death does this to you You know? You can always know how much to respect a person By who is attending his funeral what do you mean? In my opinion, the number of attendees is scant today I hardly counted 40 people Fed up Come here! Just like the old days, Charles. And you are chasing me around the park However, the difference is that the result today will be different excuse me Sorry about your loss, Mackintosh. Ruth was a classy woman And a good girlfriend I'll miss her so much. - Thank you, Mrs. Bradman. I know she liked you, too I can't really believe it's gone My mother always said that time is a doctor that heals all sorrows You were never a significant opponent at croquet, Charles. You make me sick I will kill you Don't be a fool, I'm already dead You should get your medical kit before anyone else kills Edna was right This place is damned I can't stand to see you again - The feeling is mutual, Charles. I have become a shameless villain out of age and disappointment (Charles)! (Charles)! - Everything would be great - she's not here Who is not in the presence? - (Elvira)! where am I? - At the madhouse There's no point in resisting, Charles. The more you turn, the longer they'll keep you here Why am I here? They admitted you to a spa under the Psychotherapy Act She will be subject to mandatory monitoring for the next 28 days May you chastise me in hell It's not wise to be snappy with the only person who can help you I would rather eat my tongue than ask for your help You may be able to do this Doctor McKions plans to take you downstairs in a quarter of an hour For ECT What? No! No, come back Wait Of course, there is usually a way to circumvent these matters what do you want from me? I know you'll never forgive me, Charles. And to hang in the norms with you As you hold mourning for another woman it is an even worse measure of death I agree with you most agree This is why I want a divorce With pleasure And I know the person who can do that good Ambulance" Move aside It is impossible for me to put my life in your hands again Don't get caught up in yourself, Charles. When I think about what would have happened had I succeeded On taking you to the other side, I shudder Nothing but quarrels and quarrels is forever Drive the car When I think now about our marriage years I can now see with disgusting clarity that it was nothing but a joke I was sterile And reckless And morally destabilizing I think I realized it before we left (Budley Celtine) Nobody but a huge dull He would have considered going to Bodley Celtine on his honeymoon What's wrong with Bodley Celtine? Seven hours a day on golf. And a 3-part orchestra with melody (Mary England) I am surprised you weren't complaining at the time I remember that you were good at whining - you really complained But you refused to listen That is why I took an emotional walk in the marshes With captain (pressgirl) How blind a fool I was Has he established a relationship with you? Just discreetly Ambulance" Mr (condominium) I feel so relieved that you arrived safely Follow me The moon is full tonight and we must harness its energy We're both ready to directly perform the rite of excommunication Is she here? Yes Are you sure she has complied with the operation? Yes Yes With this magic smoke I pray to the Moon Fire Spirit Dancer of time The lady of beginnings and endings To return our holy sister Into its legal realm Is she still here? Yes Yes To you, O Spirit of the Earth Thee, O element of air You, O power of water Here, O fire energy A gift from the dew of the rose plant - Is she still here? Yes Yes! Obsessions of ghosts, ghouls and demons That never met like this one Crown of Kings plant and sacred ritual I drive you out into the night The bladder herb, the cysticercus herb The bladder herb Yes Yes And... the bladder herb - (Ruth)! - (Ruth)! I am very happy to see you again, my dear Curse! How could I be so clumsy? There must have been a terrible mistake Yeah, and this isn't the first time You bitch! My dear! Save the effort on yourself I am already dead The most important thing is that you are also dead She died last Tuesday Don't be so emotionless Are you in pain, my dear? (Charles)... what happened to me? There was a car accident... It is something I have to admit that I had a hand in it - I'm so sorry, Ruth. - I'm afraid sorry isn't enough Well... though... On the occasion of this spirit of openness I'd also like to apologize for having a relationship with (Charles) before your eyes Well, practically we're still married so... Stop it, Elvira! Ruth suffered enough What are you saying, Mr. Condomin? Not now, Mrs. (Arkati) it has got very much worse You know? I should have squeezed malum citria. At the critical point It is sour lemon juice, lemon juice The only reason he was able to finish the script During exactly 5 days it is I typed it - Yeah... - Is that right, Charles? not exactly And Charles didn't want to tell you we're done Because he wanted to spend more time alone with me (Charles) Let's not quarrel, my dear Which "dear" are you referring to? But after all I endured, how did you do this to me? It's not as simple as that... - My dear - Really, Charles? You never loved me and Elvira The only person you loved was yourself No... It is something we finally agree on If you wrote the text... Did he write any of his books? - No, not a word And he took all the glory? - Won't you stay to attend the second part? - I think I'd better leave Seir is a woman with a greater insult than Hell Try two women sair Good luck with the lemon where did he go? - He can run away... - But he cannot hide Obsessions of ghosts, ghouls and demons That never met like this one The bladder plant, the crown of kings and the sacred ritual I drive you out into the night Donald!

"I see things exactly as they are." "The rest of the world needs glasses." love it Well... retool the scene! Make up! I want to get closer You're a genius, Charles. Viewers will be excited about the spiritual viewpoint Yes It's a pity that Ruth isn't here to be fun Mr. Condomin? (Haida Hopper) from the Los Angeles Times. (Condominium) Hello- How do you feel when you are talking to the country? That's very nice of you, but I'm not sure... That anyone is interested in the humble writer My intuition predicts that my 35 million readers will fascinate me With the story of the thief of others' books Thief of others' literature? I know you enjoy gossip and scandals, Miss Hopper, but... This is a disgraceful accusation and totally dishonorable There is nothing dishonorable about Mr. Morales's notification. Would you like to comment on the fact... That your 15 detective novels, Frank Flowers Based on crime novels (Inspector Francisco Flores) word for word Which is leading the sales in all (Mexico)? Smile at the camera, Mr. Condomin. You are! Don't pretend to be shocked, Charles. We both know there is no such thing as an original story - How could you do this to me? - Can you shut up!

One way to say yes And two for rejection Yes, here I am What happened to the saying Leave others to rest in peace? Mr. Condomin... I simply wanted to apologize for any role that I might have played In your early death I'm not behind the wheel, Mrs. Arctati. No, but I'm afraid I filled the tank with fuel Well... this is life I also wanted to express my gratitude Without you, I was still looking Well, at least one of us is enjoying a happy ending Can I dare... and ask How is the situation in the afterlife? - Charles! - Charles!
