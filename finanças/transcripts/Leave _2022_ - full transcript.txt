911. What's your emergency? Hello? There's a baby. Ma'am? You said baby? Is it okay? There's a baby. Joshua Hill Cemetery. Please hurry. It's crying. - Is it your baby? - It's crying. Hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Oh, no. Hey! Hunter! You better get going. It's a seven-hour drive. What are you doing down there? Uh, just picking up a book for the trip. You're driving the whole way there, right? Yeah, it's, uh, just for stops on the road. So, Georgetown. Excited? Of course. Go, go, go. Okay. Okay. Hey. -Oh, thanks. -Heh. Gonna miss you. But it's gonna be great. Hey. Hey, I'm proud of you, kiddo. First one in the family to go to college. That's really something. -Mom -- -I love you, Dad. I love you, too. Give me a call me when you settle in. Hey, uh, and drive safe. Will do. Bye. Bye. And no boys, right? Right. In 500 yards, take Exit 40 toward Logan International Airport. Hi! Hi! Sorry. I can't seem... Okay, so there's a bit of an issue. Uh, says here your arrival date was yesterday, and you're listed as a no-show. We rebooked your room this morning. -27th, right? -It's the 28th. Let me see if I can, uh... Message received today at 1:59 a.m. Hey, Hunter. It's Dad. What's happening? Just checking in, you know, see how you're doing. I haven't heard from you. Just a little worried, you know? Anyway, hope your drive went well. Um, you're probably busy making friends and settling into your dorm. Remember, no boys. Um, don't be a stranger. Call me. I love you, kid. Bye. Hello? Sorry. -Do you want a beer? -I already got one. What? Are you looking for someone? No. Just having a drink. Nice performance. Cheers. Aah! Help! What do you want? I'm calling the cops! I can't understand you. Why are you following Cecilia? Because I'm her daughter! What?! Maybe. I think so. I've been getting threats from my fans. So when I saw you took the bottle, I thought it was you. I'm sorry. Why didn't you just come talk to me? People lie. Hunter, I'm not your mother. That can't be. I don't have children. I was never able to. But you have to be. Look. September 22, 2002. I was abandoned at a cemetery in Oakville, Massachusetts. I was wrapped in this. Your band was on tour in my town that night. I... I-I took a DNA test that says I'm 99% Scandinavian. What did he just say? That you're Anna and Kristian's daughter. Who? This is all I could find. So that's Kristian, your father. And that's your mom, Anna. Kristian was our bass player, and he insisted on bringing Anna on the tour, knowing that she would have to give birth along the way. We all said it was crazy, but they wouldn't listen. At one point, they had a really big fight. And Anna took the baby -- you -- and disappeared. Where are they now? Please tell me. I wish I had better news for you. After Anna left, Kristian lost his mind and claimed that she killed the baby. So he left tour, went looking for her, went back to Norway, found her, and the baby was missing. So he abducted her and drove her up to the local church where she grew up... ...and left her inside. Set fire to the building. Can I have a glass of water? Why did he think she killed the baby? She wasn't treated very well, you know, and I think she got back at him the only way she knew -- to threaten self-harm and harm to the baby. Were troubled souls, both of them. More than I realized. What happened to him? He got 21 years for murder. Later diagnosed with schizophrenia and moved to a mental institution. He served his time but chose to stay. He couldn't cope with the outside world. Is he still there? After all I told you, you still want to go see him? I need to know why I was left in a fucking cemetery. Journalist? -How old are you? -Journalism student. I'm doing a paper on Norwegian black metal. Is he even allowed to have visitors? Of course he's allowed to have visitors. This isn't a prison. It's a care facility. Kristian needs to approve his own visitors, so I have to go and check with him first. You stay here, okay? Okay. Hi, I'm Kristian. I'm Hunter. Really nice to meet you. So, student from America. Exciting. Yeah. Don't get many visitors. So, I'm, um... You're nervous. Yeah, maybe a-a little. I'm just new to this whole interview thing. I won't bite. I promise. So, what do you want to talk about? So I'm doing a paper on Norwegian black metal, and, uh... What? Sorry, it's just you... You look familiar. Uh, have I met you before? No. Where would that have been? Yeah. So you were saying? Yes, I'm -- I'm doing a story on black metal, and your part in it is pretty important. I hope you're here to talk about music and not about the other stuff. Well, I was hoping to get a sense of the whole story, you know? What happened to your arm? Just some shit I went through in the past. What kind of shit? Look, I've been in a dark place, okay? That's all I want to say about that. During the trial, you said something about a girlfriend, Anna. You said that she'd killed your child. I thought this was going to be about music. As I said, I'm trying to get a sense of whole picture here. Yeah. Sure you are. We had a baby and she killed it. Really? -How do you know that? -She told me. -She told you that she -- -Listen -- And then went crazy when she had the baby. She cried when she realized it was a girl, talking all kinds of nonsense. And then one day she disappeared with it and called me later from the airport, telling me that she'd taken care of it. "Taken care of it." Meaning "killed it"? Yeah. -Why? -She didn't want it. Why not? Please tell me. How old are you? 25. Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Tell me who you are! Tell me who you are! What did she think was wrong with the baby? Please! Sorry. Fuck. Was my mom like that too? No. She was a sweetheart. Kind of quiet. Her family was wealthy and religious, so of course she loved hanging out with the band. Was she sane? Yeah, she had her ups and downs. Didn't exactly win the genetic lottery, did I? You seem fine to me. She left me in a cemetery. Why would someone do that? W-Why the blanket? Why the symbols? Is there something wrong with me? No, Hunter, there is nothing wrong with you. -What about this? -What about it? Why was I left with a satanic cross? That's a wolf's cross. It's from Norse mythology. It's quite a common symbol here. It's, uh -- you know, back in the days, you could pick up one of those almost anywhere. It's... I'm sure your mother wanted you to have it. Did she talk to anyone else? Besides Kristian, I mean. Anyone who I could talk to? She kind of kept to herself. Wrote in a diary. -A diary? -She wrote in it all the time. Any idea where it could be? If it's anywhere, I guess it would have to be with her family. Where do they live? Do you believe in ghosts? I'm undecided. Why do you ask? I feel like something wants me leave. Maybe it's your intuition. -Do you speak English? -I do, a little, yes. Do you know Anna Norheim? Anna? She died many years ago. Why? She was my mother. If Anna is your mother, then I'm your -- your aunt. -No... -So you're her sister? No, my husband is her uncle. So you're married to her father's brother, so you're her aunt. Yeah. Who lives here now? Well, in this house, it's only me and my husband, Olav, Torstein lives in the manor. He was the father. -My grandfather? -Yes. And that's it? There's three of you? Well, my -- my son, Stian, lives a little bit from here. The rest moved away. My grandmother too? No, she died. I mean, those who live have moved away. It's so good to have you here. You know, Torstein, he -- after Anna died, he changed a lot. Nice to meet you. Hi. I -- I can't understand. Nice to meet you. Okay. Men, you know? Come. Do you maybe have some of my mom's old things? You'll have to ask Torstein for permission. He will be home later. He doesn't like to have guests unannounced. Guess I'll return tomorrow, then. No, no. You can sleep here. No, that's very nice, but I think it's better -- Please. It will be so nice to have you here. You can have Stian's old room. Maybe a hotel? No, please stay. I insist. - Morning. - Good morning! This is my son, Stian. - Hi. - Hi there. -It's nice to meet you. -You too. So did you have a good night's sleep? Sure. Ah, were either of you up late last night? No. Why? Something weird happen? No, nothing. Is Torstein back yet? Yes. He will see you this morning. He didn't want to wake you. -So can I go see him? -Yeah, sure. Excuse me. Torstein? My -- My name is Hunter. I'm... I don't -- I don't know how to say it. It sounds kind of crazy, but I'm... I know. I can see her face in yours. Have they told you who I am? You're my grandfather. It's a pleasure to meet you. Finally. Thank you. I... I wanted to find you. But I... I didn't know where to look. I never imagined you would be in -- in America. You were put in a good family? Yeah, it's -- it's just me and my dad now. But he's a good guy. Good. It's good. And what does he think about you coming here? I didn't tell him yet. You lied? No, I... He wouldn't understand. He'd probably try to talk me out of it. And it would be a whole thing. I did want to hurt his feelings. Let me show you something. So nobody knows about your trip? No. What about your adoptive mother? She died. Was this recent? A few months ago. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, here we are. Where are we? Your mother's room. Anna's room. Just look around. I love skiing too. Just take your time. I... I'll be downstairs. Thanks. -Amen. -Amen. This is so nice. I just want to... So you grew up with two brothers? -Yeah. -Mm. Um, Barry and Marcus. Mm-hmm. They moved out when I was young, so they live with their own families now. Well, they're not really your brothers, are they? Your parents must have been so happy to have a little girl. You know, you -- You remind me of your mother. -I do? -Mm-hmm. -She was a quiet girl, too. -I'm not that quiet. Well, you didn't interrupt grace, unlike some. You know, boys get away with everything, don't they? We girls, we have to stick together. Yeah. My mom would have preferred it if I was a girl. Oh, I never said that, did I? Well, girls rock anyway. Where are you going to college? Georgetown. Why not Harvard? Or Yale? Because I got a scholarship, and Georgetown is a really good university. Yeah, it's one of the best. You should be proud. -Yeah. -Thank you. Torstein only accepts the best. You did send me to a boarding school in Zurich. And what a waste of money. Well, I'm supposed to be there now. Just took a little detour. Please, please, try the meat. It's -- It's really good. - Yeah? - What is it? It's deer. It's a -- It's a family recipe. And it was Anna's favorite. She would sit in that chair at every meal. It was her seat. Now it's yours. It took you a long time to find us. Yeah. I'm sorry my -- No, no, no. You found us. That's what's important. Yeah. Please, go ahead. While it's warm. You know we had a daughter too. She was Stian's big sister, but we lost her. Just a few years before Torstein lost your mother. Oh, she and Anna were like sisters. I'm -- I'm really sorry. It's a long time ago. But you never forget, so... I think I have to retire now. Um... Our family has lived on this land for five generations. And this garden... I've tended it since I was a boy. Ridding it of weeds. It's -- It's really beautiful. Does it feel familiar? I don't know. Maybe. I think we have inside us a kind of contact or, um... -Connection? -Connection, yes. Connection to our past and where we are from. Even if we haven't been there. Maybe. Why do you think she left me in the cemetery? Maybe because it's a holy place, she -- she thought you'd be safe there. Do you think I can maybe look through some of her old stuff? Like her diary, for instance? Her diary? Yeah, a friend of Kristian told me that she kept one. You -- You spoke to one of those musicians? Yeah. What was he like? She. It was the singer. Uh, she was super nice. She showed me all the pictures and helped me connect the dots. Oh. I never expected kindness from one of them. But the Lord works in mysterious ways. Are you a person of God, Hunter? Um, sure. Yeah. You honor and obey your father? I guess so. You know what I'm speaking of? The Fourth Commandment. Very good, very good. Honor thy father. And mother. So, about the diary, do you know where it is? I-I don't think she kept one. Not as far as I know. Did you keep a-any other things from her, like anything at all? Just the things in her room. I -- I got rid of the rest. Why? It was too painful. My little girl, to see her fall in with the wrong sort. Do you mind if I... Do you mind if I maybe look for it? I can't -- I can't go through all that again. It's... Would you leave it alone? Kindly, would you, please? Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. -There she is. -Hey. The daughter of my Satanist cousin and the psycho killer. -Think that's funny? -A little bit. Did you know my mom? Yeah. Kind of. Do you know if she kept a diary? I don't know. I was six when she died, so... She might have had one. Any idea where it is? I would guess the attic at Torstein's. So you want to search the big house? Well, he didn't want me to. Well, what Torstein doesn't know won't hurt him, right? Are you sure? Get in. Did Torstein give you the whole "obey" speech? Yeah. The Fourth Commandment. Are you a Christian too? Look, I-I just want my mom's diary. -Why? -I just do. It's not like you're the only Norheim to be totally fucked in the head. What do you mean? My family has kind of a dark past. So, my grandmother, she was this total domineering bitch. She died when my father and Torstein were young. She fell down the stairs and broke her neck. My aunt, she had some serious mental problems, though. Slit her wrists in the bathtub before I was born. My older sister, she... ...ran away, disappeared when I was four. And no one has seen her since. And then there's your mother. She became a black-metal groupie. She was burned alive... ...inside this old church. It's right down the road. Boo! You asshole. What? They... They were all women. Yeah. I guess that makes you the last living Norheim girl. I got to go. -Seriously? -Yeah, no worries. Torstein usually leaves the front door open anyway. Good luck. Thanks. You've been very helpful. Are you okay? Give that to me. Give it to me, please. -Wait, no. I need that. -Please leave. -But -- -I can't abide the thief now. -Go. -No, no, look. I'm sorry I stole it, but I need my mom's diary. If I can just borrow it for a few days. No. It's been rotting away in the attic for two decades. Come on, you give a shit. You're no longer welcome here. You should go. Out. Guys. Listen, you've both been really nice. I need a favor. I found my mom's diary. Torstein took it. Can you talk to him? Ask him to let me borrow it? It's very hard to get Torstein to do something if it doesn't want to. I get it. He's the boss. Can you try? Olaf. Fine. Whatever. So I'll be on my way then. Thanks for your hospitality. -I'm so sorry. -Lillian. Here. Thanks. So you live here? Mm. Home sweet home. It's nice. After my parents pissed away my inheritance, Torstein gave them the old servants house. When I moved out, I got the boat. Which was always supposed to be mine anyway. Just like everything else. Then you turned up. -What? -Nothing. I'm Just wondering if you're okay, that's all. -Yeah, I'm fine. -You sure? 'Cause you look kind of fucked up. Like a proper girl. Can you please stop? Been a crap day. No shit. Banished from the family in less than 48 hours. It's impressive. So you really want that diary, huh? I do. You know, Torstein has this youth group between 6:00 and 9:00 tonight at the local chapel. The house will be empty. I could take you if you want. Why are you helping me? Maybe I feel a bit bad. I shouldn't have left you alone back then. Sorry. Thank you. Let's go. Benefits of a boarding school education. Keep lights off. Stay away from the windows. Check the library. Find anything? No. Stian. Stian! I found it. -What are you doing? -Nothing. Put that back. It's fine. Pretend you didn't see it. I'm so stupid. That's why you came here, isn't it? What's the big deal? He thinks you're a thief anyway. I said I'm just taking pictures. Put the fucking money back. Then they get nothing out of this. No inheritance, no quick cash, no nothing. What are we going to do about that? Stian. I should be getting something out of this. We get back, and I'll pay you. How about that? That's too boring, come on. -Stop it. -Stop what? -Stop. -Is this bothering you? Hey, relax. I'm -- I'm joking. I told you the stop. Yeah, and I can't help myself. Look. I'll get it some other time. What are you doing? Everything here is mine. Including you. Fuck! Where are you going, huh? You want this, don't you? Look at me. Look at me. Stop! -Stop! -Fuck you! Bitch! Look at me. Look at me. Hi. It's Hunter. I screwed up. I could really use someone to talk to. Please call me back. Hi. This is Raylan White. I can't get to the phone at the moment, but if you leave the message, I'll get back to you as soon as possible. You know what to do. Hi, Dad. Um... I-I just wanted to call. You're probably still asleep. I'm not at Georgetown. I'm in Norway. Bet you didn't see that coming. So Mom told me the truth. She told me how you found me and... Look, I'm sorry I lied. I-I-I guess I thought it was okay because your mom lied to me first. But it's not okay. I just -- I'm confused. I don't know who I am. And now I've done something incredibly stupid, and I just want to come home. There's this darkness. Something from my past. You didn't check if he was alive? No. I freaked out and ran. Who are you calling? I'm calling an ex who's a doctor at the emergency. Is Stian alive? Yep, he's gonna be fine. He's got a concussion, and you gave him a minor skull fracture. But you know what? I think he got off easy. -Can you translate? -You found it. And skip to the final weeks. Is something wrong? This isn't your mother's diary. I'm sorry, but, um... Look, the writer mentions her. Anna sits outside. I'm sorry. Need a moment. Hunter, are you okay? Sure. Whatever. I'm sorry you didn't get the answers you wanted. Doesn't matter. Done here. You're going home. Taking a plane tomorrow. Getting out before the Norheims or anyone else can track me down. Maybe that's for the best. Just one thing. Have you considered telling Kristian the truth? I can't find the words. I mean... You're alive. Look at you. You're so beautiful. What about Anna? Listen. It was wrong of me to think she hurt you. That's why you killed her, wasn't it? But I didn't. Don't lie to me. You threatened her in public. They found your driver's license at the crime scene. I can't explain that. What do you think happened? Whatever I talk about it, people call me crazy. Try me. I think it's at that place he's from. There's evil there. -Evil like what? -I don't know. She never told me her... I never listened. Well, I went there to look for her diary. Couldn't find it. Didn't happen to take it, did you? You went there? Were you okay? Did anything -- The diary. Ever read it? Many boyfriends do. Why are you so curious about that diary? Because I need to know why she left me. What about me was so bad? You said she didn't want me. What exactly did she say? If I leave now, it will be the last time you ever see me. You owe me the truth. Anna didn't want you because you were a girl. We're done. -Leave? -I am leaving. -No. Leave! L-I-V. It's your name. And named you after her cousin, the one that went missing. I loved your mother. I didn't kill her, I swear. I know. No, I... -Where are you going? -Back to the Norheim estate. -Why? -Because I need to know how she died. Don't go there. You can't trust those people. Something is wrong. Liv! Something is wrong! Let go of me! Mom? It's me. It's Hunter. It's Liv. Do you recognize this? Liv gave it to me. -And I gave it to her. -It's me. It's me. Yeah, it's me. No, no, no, no, no, no. You have to run, Liv. Quickly, go, go. Where's the key? Where's the key? I don't know. Please. We got to get out of here. Please. Please. We got to get out of here. Liv? Liv? I'm so sorry this happened to you. I know who you are. I shouldn't have seen it right away. Drinking those Strutting around like some harlot. Help! Help! No one can hear you. Help! Help! Help! Help! Don't touch me. Touch you? Get your filthy head out of the gutter. That is not what I do. If you want to corrupt a man, there's nothing more effective than the female form. And it's still just in our family. Everywhere I turn, I see... I see the same fault. Sinfulness. The serpent cursed this world with lustfulness and the debauchery. And as a man of Christ, I cannot abide -- You're not a Christian! You're just a goddamn murderer. No. Hunter. I'm... I can save you from evil. Like I have with your mother. No matter how long it takes, I will catch you. Please trust me. It won't work. Tried it so many times before. And the devil that was deceived and was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet were. What are you doing? And there... they shall be tormented. Please. Day and night, all time hence. This is a cleansing fire. -Please don't. -Accept it. Accept it. This is an accepting fire! Accept it! Go away, Satan. I am a child of God. Get out, get out. We have to go. We have to go now. Come on. What? Come on. Come on, please. Come on! No, no, no. Come on, please. Just leave me. Please! Go. Go! I'll get help. -Where is she? -She ran. You fucking coward. You fucking coward. You are calling me a coward? What is that silly thing? I'm so sorry, Liv. I'm sorry. Why? I abandoned you. I couldn't take you back here. I waited in the woods till that policeman came. I waited. I understand. Hi, Dad. You found out.
