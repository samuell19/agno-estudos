Are you feeling okay? Yeah, I am. Want anything? Let's see... I wish we could've lived together again... You, me, your dad... I thought you hated him. I didn't hate him. We just couldn't live together. I'm sorry. Will you feel better if I brought him back? Mom? Stop staring at me like that. I'm just feeling lonely. Just take a seat, Dad. Fine. - When you're ready. - Okay... Can you play it again? Simply, your friend, a blank piece of paper turning black, my life becomes shorter I'm the black pen inscribing the just life I live. Someday I'll make this world a better place... How're things with Takeshi? Same old, same old. We're here if you need us. Thanks. Does his music pay the bills? We're getting by with his day job. Sounds tough. How long have the two of you been living together? Eight years. And with Ran? Seven years. Why haven't you tied the knot? Because we're both cautious divorcees, I guess. Especially you. Hey. Hello? Mikako came here for you. Be polite. Tonight's Ran's night. Let her be. I've always let her have her way. You're lucky you can study abroad, you know? I think it's incredible that she knows what she wants to do at her age. Why are you pouting? She's just nervous about her flight tomorrow. You're too soft on her, Haru. Listen to me. I've raised you better than this. She doesn't want to talk. You won't get far being self-centered. She'll be fine. You haven't seen her as a child. Ran can be a brat. She's an only child. What's wrong with that? You wouldn't understand. Why not? Only people like Mikako who's given birth and raised a child from day one would know how to guide one. You're probably right. I'm not Ran's mom, after all. That's not what I meant. I'm leaving. Ran! Let her go. Ran! Wait. Are you okay? You can leave him. Huh? You can dump my dad. Excuse me? I know you put up with him. How so? I've got a whole list. A list, huh? Tell me one good thing that's come from living with him? I can name lots. Oh, yeah? For example? You came. I'm gone tomorrow. Come to Canada with me. What? Just kidding. Hey, that's not very nice. I can finally be alone. Is that how you really feel? Well... Yes and no. I wonder if I was just as confusing at your age. Oh, come on. What? I'm sure you were way more complicated. Why's that? I think my mom had it rough, too. I see. I wonder why... Why what? He doesn't get people's feelings. Thanks. For what? Let's go. Okay. Take care of yourself. Have a safe flight. Thanks. Hey. Hey, what's wrong? You okay? I'm just a little dizzy. Don't get up. I need to make lunch. I'll do it. You'll be late for work. It's fine, I'll call in. Let's go, Kotaro. Just get some rest. Thanks... Please... just one month's worth. No. You need to wean off the meds. I need to talk to Takeshi. You do? He needs treatment, too. You taking sleeping pills won't solve the world's problems. Filming, editing, and all that other stuff shouldn't be killing you. You're family. He's sacrificing himself, too. Your child is the only one who can't live without you. You have to say no. If it's too much for you, just be honest with him. Did you want to lie down? Okay, hold on. Call me if there's anything else I can do. Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food. It was delicious. I'm glad. - How about you? - It was yummy. Good. Remember the song I recorded? I want you and Kotaro to listen to it. Okay. Hold on. I'm the black pen. Simply, your friend, a white piece of paper turning black, my life becomes shorter. I'm the black pen inscribing the just life I live. Someday this world will change for the better. "The disease is incurable." When he heard the words, devastation, tore them apart. Under surveillance Is she suicidal? Under suspicion. Come on, no way. She's fine, just asleep. Every breath resonates... Why did our marriage fail again? You said you wanted a divorce. I did? Yeah. I told you I didn't want to. Did you even put up a fight? Well, we did marry for love. May I? Sure. I'm getting remarried. Who's the girl? Someone from work. She's younger than you. First marriage? I think so. Shouldn't you know if you're getting married? It happened quick. What do you mean? She's pregnant. Five months. - Second trimester? - Yup. Congrats, good for you. Is it, though? Of course. I can't fool around anymore. Whatever. What? When you and I were together, I kinda cheated on you. I know. What? - I knew. - Seriously? Man... I see. Okay... - I'm glad. - Why? Because... I never really knew why you wanted a divorce. I thought it was 'cause of the miscarriage. But there was nothing I could do. So, I guess it was my infidelity. Well, I'm kinda relieved. As a child... I was sexually abused by my grandpa. Huh? What'd you say? I suffered sexual abuse from my grandpa. Is that for real? Yeah, it's real and pretty sick. - Seriously? - Yeah. How come you're telling me now? I'm not sure. I just felt like it, I guess. If you had told me that before... If so? I'm not sure... Foster Parents Wanted Recently, the Ministry has been promoting foster care, but it requires consent by the biological parents. And even if you register today, it will take time. But there are lots of kids needing foster parents, aren't there? There are. If you're passionate and meet the conditions, you can register. There's also the option of being a foster parent only on the weekends. What did you say? I already talked to the agency. I don't understand. I want us to raise a foster child. You're just experiencing empty nest syndrome. Plus, Ran's study abroad isn't cheap. Fostering is a serious commitment. I know. No, you don't. The kid might be beaten up and broken inside. Ordinary women like you won't be able to handle it. You'd never know. There's no way. You've been acting weird ever since Ran left. I'm thirsty. I'm... in love with someone else. We need to break up. Mikako. How are you feeling? Much better, thanks. You sure? That's great. Sorry to have to ask, but... Transcribing? Do you mind? I wanna finish my new song before the show. Okay. Thanks. You're amazing. Are you okay? Where... am I? How'd it go? He's fine. His head too. I'll give it another shot. I'm ready. Thank you very much! You grab me, cry, and run back to your room, on the followin' day, we raise our head in revenge. Written text, fingers tracing the words, forming the grand epic, embrace me, and its freedom... Can I take another stab at it? I'm ready to go. I'm the black pen. Simply, your friend, Six years since the first album, we conversate in this fun city. Illuminate, let your words lead the way. Rapper, let's have fun. Born on the stage, shouting out to the crowd. Raise your hand, the party tonight. Strongest are the people, life in play, ocean in the chest, nostalgic smile. Watching over, Kobe above our head. The moment I head to the studio with the god falling upon me, My favorite disciple, Follow me sharing in this feeling. Yeah, he's fine. His head too. But he may have amnesia caused by trauma. He needs to be away from what's stressing him out. Eat more. Don't be shy. You don't talk much. Takeshi. - Here you go. - Thanks. Someone has to take care of him. It's so bizarre. Paying for all his medical bills... You're not even related. It's strange, don't you think? His parents might be looking for him. No one's filed a missing person's report. - You checked? - Yeah. You still can't remember your name, right? Yeah... Do you want a name? How about Naruto? What the heck, Sis? It means, "survivor." Do you like it? Are you being serious right now? Good name or not, it's inappropriate. Hold on. What're you trying to do? Watch him 'til his memory's back. We're against it. - Right? - Come on. The hospital found a place for me to stay, so I'm planning to go there. - That's wonderful. - I feel bad, but... Here. Take it. To get you there. Thank you. Get yourself together, Sis. For reals. I'm gonna go. Sorry, Mom. And thanks. - Sure. Tell Mikako hello. - See you. Take care. - G'night. - Good night. It's late, so stay the night. But Takeshi just gave him money for his ride. Stay tonight. Okay? The trains are still running. Just stay. Bath's all yours. How was it? Pretty good, I think. Really? That's a relief. I know it was all new to you, but you did really well. Are you worried? The next venue's big, so I need to be ready. Finally. I'll do my best. The bath's warm. I'm gonna sleep. What time are you waking up? Six. Okay. Take it easy, okay? Good night. Are you okay? What's wrong? I hadn't properly introduced myself. I'm Haru Tsukishima. Haru means "spring." I'm not married. Any questions? Nope. Ask me something. Have you ever moved out? I came back recently... Wait, do you even care? I don't. I saw you being bombarded with questions so... I'm just tired. You said you wanted fresh air. Your favorite place? The beach nearby. Why? It helps me forget all the bad memories. Sorry... I really am. It's better than not having any at all. Stay with us awhile. No thanks. Why not? Why should I? Huh? You want to adopt a stranger? I just wanted to help you. And the timing was right. I don't get it. When one door closes, another opens, you know? I've always wanted a child of my own. - There was this girl, Ran... - That's creepy. Don't say that. It's creepy though. Fine then. Leave if you want to. Or stay. It's up to you. Morning. Can you open the door? I can't seem to open it. It won't open 'cause I've locked it. What? I'll let you out if you agree to stay forever. What's all the racket? Hello? - Huh? - It's locked. What? Locked? Hold on. Haru, where's the key? Why'd you lock it? Wait quietly while I go get the key. Geez. Where is it? It's gone. Do you have it, Haru? Where is it? Give it here. Wait. Give me the key! Give it. Quiet down! Haru, the key! Geez. I'm opening it now. I'll kill myself if you leave. One month later... Kotaro seems fine. He gets a fever when excited. I see. He will tonight then. Yeah. Do you think Naruto really lost his memory? I don't know. Wow, really? What? I thought you believed him. It doesn't matter. Why not? It keeps my mind off Ran. Oh. I see. Have you spoken to her? She texts me sometimes. Takeshi was worried too. Well, there's no need to. He should focus on your health instead. True. Why did you and Soichiro split up? He fell in love with someone else. I see. So, about my husband, he's become a shut-in. What do you mean? He takes the dog out for just 30 minutes in the morning, but after that, he spends all day glued to the TV, you know? What's wrong, Naruto? What should I do? How about your husband? He still works regularly. He's active, huh? Must be nice. Mine used to be too. I don't know what to do. Thank you for coming. What were you chatting about? - Drink up while it's hot. - Thanks. Naruto, lunch's ready! Kotaro. Freedom. Money. Money. Strike. Fork. This is grandma's embodiment. Lovey-dovey. Good night. Brothers. One-hundred. Grandpa's obsession. Thanks always. Burgers. I can eat it. Giant pen. Mikako. Kotaro. Big bro's snot. Gratitude. Ninja. Knight. Rose. Big money. I was thinking... About? It isn't healthy. What isn't? It's already weird taking him in. But giving him a name? It's none of your business. Yes, it is. How? What if his memory never comes back? So what? What'll happen to our Naruto? What do you mean? Why do you care? Don't say it like that. I've never forgotten... about Naruto. Why does everyone bring it up? I haven't forgotten, either. There's only one Naruto. You're contradicting yourself. What's he like? Hey. Do you even care? I don't. Stop it. You're feisty now, aren't you? Come on. There's nothing we can do. We're here to celebrate your birthday. I wish Takeshi were here. Hey, Mom? What? Remember when you and Dad had that big fight? There're too many to remember. That time I ran away. I was probably only eight, and I thought I got pretty far. I ran through snow and hid in the woods. Why'd you run away? I thought people would search for me and it would stop the fight. I remember. But I was found right away. How'd you find me? We found you... because of the blood in the snow. There was a trail. What? We followed the trail and found you crouched, sobbing. No way. You had a bloody nose. A bloody nose? I called your name and when you turned around, you had tears and blood all over. I was shocked. Mikako, Mikako Tsukishima. Please come in. Would you excuse us for a minute? I was used to seeing you fight, but it felt different that time. You were crying so much. That was because your father was threatening to leave us. Why? He fell for a Taiwanese woman. He wanted to go and live with her. I didn't know... Was Takeshi there, too? Yeah. He was giving everyone bananas. Did he really do that? Yeah. He thought the sugar would calm everyone down. He tried to force you to eat it while you were crying. He hasn't changed, huh? Then what happened? Your dad said, "I can't believe I was about to run out on my beautiful children." So, you stayed together? Yeah, all thanks to Haru. I shouldn't have run off. Why's that? I should've let you split up. Why would you say that? We could've moved away from Grandpa. Not now in front of Naruto. What happened? Hush. It's none of your business. Don't talk to him like that. Have you been busy? Why do you ask? You look really tired. What makes you think that? Everything about you. Is that so. I wonder why? But you also seem more cheerful. That might be true. Come in. Excuse me. Someone's here for you outside. Thank you, I'll be right there. What is it? Here. Clothes for Naruto. Did Takeshi tell you? Wow, you brought so many. They're Takeshi's, so it might be too big. Thanks. You seem different. I feel a lot better with the medication. Still getting treatment? Yes, for three months now. Are you okay? Thankfully, yes. At Soichiro's clinic? You didn't know? For confidentiality reasons. That's true. When's Ran coming back? I don't know. She's planning on getting a job out there. So, she's flown the nest. Yeah, she's all grown up. Let's go to Canada someday. Not anytime soon. C'mon, just us. Sure. I should get back. - Okay. - Thanks. Take care. Thanks again. Are you okay? My bad. Gargle. "E..." East India. Azua, Dominican Republic. Chains. Science class. Spotted duck. "K..." "K..." Kay, give up. "K..." It's over. I win. Excuse me, are you Akira Higuchi? You are, right? No, he's not. Who're you? I'm his mother. Excuse us. Hey, wait. Hey. What a coincidence. Hi, yeah. I'm trying to cross, but... I had no idea all this was happening. So interesting. Hey! Akira! Wait up! C'mon, stop. Who are you? Do I know you? I'm your dad. I saw Mikako the other day. Oh, yeah? She was acting weird. Did you notice? She'll be fine. Anyway, about Naruto. Keeping him won't help. You gotta find your own happiness. Thanks. See you later. Come to my show. Thanks. Sure. This is where I work. It's a good place for us to talk. Wait here. Let's talk here. C'mon, sit. I'm Toru Higuchi. What did you say my name was? It's Akira Higuchi. Who's the lady... Am I really your son? You were ten when I left. I left you and your mom behind. Your album. Who's this? You and your mom. Keep it. No, it's okay. Hold on to it. What's mom's name? Mari Higuchi. What was she like? Beautiful and strong. She held a going away party for me before I left. You two waved goodbye to me with a smile. Where did you go? All over the world. I went to the Himalayas first, and then I went to India. Europe, too. You might not understand, but I couldn't stay with you guys. What were you doing before? Same as now. Construction work. I went to help build temporary housing after the Tohoku quake. After coming back, I didn't leave my room for a year. Mari must've been gritting her teeth. Then, one day, we got in a fight, and I told her I was leaving. Mari said it's fine. What did I say? You said I should do what I want. Oh... I'm really sorry. But that journey I went on saved me. I don't regret it. Good for you. When did you get back? Two years after I left. I promised I'd be back by then. When I returned home, you guys were gone. I thought the two of you were done with me. So I didn't search. Do you wanna start over? Yes. Yes, thank you. Okay, take care. I'm glad you're safe, Mom. Thank God you didn't run into the burglar. Cheer up. Is Naruto coming back? Of course. Why? I want him to move out soon. You think Naruto did this? No, I'm not accusing him. I'm just tired. I want to live alone again. You and Takeshi... Both of you never listen to what I have to say. You're fine because we're family. But... Naruto isn't. The mountain's that way. Ocean's there. Careful. Good view, huh? Yeah. Is there anything else you wanna ask? I'll tell you everything I know. Why are you looking for your son now? Mari died from cancer two months ago. I heard at the funeral that you went missing. I found out you took care of Mari when she became ill. Mari's parents told me. It must've been tough. Do you live with that woman? Yeah. You wanna live with me? I don't ever wanna see you again. I just don't like you as a person. Fine. Wait downstairs. I'll drive you. You're home late. What were you doing? Are you feeling okay? I was looking for work. Work? Apparently, you need an ID to work. You don't have to work. You need to take care of your body. Let's go to the city hall. You might need to get newly registered. I can work at a host club. What? The recruiter recommended it. No way. You can choose to do that sort of job eventually, but not now. Let's eat dinner. - Welcome back. - Hey. How was Kotaro? Kotaro? Um, he was fine. He jumped into Grandpa's arms. Awesome. What time is Haru and them coming? Around noon, but they're eating lunch first. You want tea? Sure. - Here. - Thanks. Hey, wait up. It's empty. You okay? - It's empty. - I told you. Wow, it's empty. Nice, thanks. You sure you can come to today's show? Show? Yeah, I'll be fine. I'm cute. Everyone loves me. By who? Someday. Awesome. It'll be great. I want to be free. Live freely. Freedom. I don't care. It doesn't matter. Leave me alone. Make food for me. Clean for me. Someone. Anyone. Take me away. Me. I'm cute. Amazing. Everyone loves me. By who? Someday. It'll be great. I want to be free. Live freely. Leave me alone. I don't care. I don't want to care. Make food for me. Clean for me. Hey. Someone. Anyone. Take me away from here. Me. Woman. Female. I'm right here. Hey. Me. I'm cute. I'm loved. Everyone loves me. By who? Someday. It'll be great. Are they here? Not yet. I copied what you do. It feels so refreshing. I didn't know I'd feel this way just by releasing my locked-up thoughts. If I had done this earlier, maybe I wouldn't have gotten sick. What's wrong? Did something happen? Soichiro told me he's in love with me. And then? I said, "Thanks." Drinking two coffees, sugar and black. Let's ride the scooter with Muto and Kato, maybe we could head to Osaka and dance in the clubs. If you're in Kobe, you'll end up hanging with Takeshi. We're just men that fit the beach. The sunset hits the bridge, we're chasing the era, just like that one time, the monstrous... We are everywhere and nowhere, a strange man, a drop out to the normie king, a vigilant master. Mother fuckin' flow. Thank you for coming! I'm Takeshi Tsukishima from Kobe. Let's get this rolling. Hey Takeshi. Yeah, I know. You doing good? How's it going, future me? Kotaro is still a babe. You can't hang at Famima anymore, let's have fun outdoors. I wake up, feeling good like a lie, negative heartache that I prayed away. The art I made while sober, that's my therapist. On the field, iPod allowed, the birds sing my instinct. Changing my poison to medicine, treating my despair. Rising from the depths of hell, the hallway and courtyard. The orange light at night, the stories that you only told me. Under the same roof, thanks, I behaved so we could live good. I spread my wings into the world. We ain't crazy. Hey Kyoto! Hey Takeshi, let's play, we're normal. How's it going my future me? You guys are the best. Next song's the last one for the night. Please listen. I'm the black pen, simply, your friend, a blank piece of paper turning black, my life becomes shorter. I'm the black pen, simply, your friend, inscribing the just life I live, changing our world for the better. "This disease is incurable." Devastation tore Takeshi apart, under surveillance cameras, they think she'll commit suicide. No, my wife ain't that weak. Her breath echoes into my chest, in a white room like a prison, swallow the sleeping pill and on the bed we doze. From confinement to inspection, let my words lead the way. "Doc, I won't hurt anyone no more, so give me back my paper and pen." Thank you very much! You grab me, cry, and run back to your room, on the followin' day, we raise our head in revenge. Written text, fingers tracing the words, tracing the memories of friendship, forming the grand epic, embrace me, and its freedom... Hospital, south ward, building one. "Hey Kura, you asleep? I took a nap after taking Olanzapine." "Man, I feel so good!" Listen to the man on welfare or dream? In the bed, letting my words lead the way. Kyoto's a lot of fun. Got a job thanks to a friend as a care provider. Past in mind, mastery in hand, acknowledge the paper and me, looking for a superior master, connecting with our heart. I'm being useful like the Akashi Bridge. Wandering around, absorbed in talking to the invisible someone. Euphoria, so high, physically handicapped, always being watched, heart receiving everything, friendship. Let our words lead the way, meet that someone, I believe in you. This stage is the best... - Stop Takeshi! - She's mine! You're wrong! You're messed up! - Let go of me! - What's so funny? I'm gonna kill you! She's my girl, you hear me? She's mine! Look at Mikako! She's mine. She's... - Let's calm... - Fix your attitude! Hey, stop! You'll never make Mikako happy! Die! Get lost! C'mon, go! Get out! I'm really sorry. All right. Let's go. She's mine. You came? Yeah, Takeshi told me about today. This is Kenji, my ex-husband. Who's this? Naruto? We are everywhere and nowhere, a strange man, a drop out to the normie king, a vigilant master. Mother fuckin' flow. Forget about Soichiro. I'm a better man. It's not about that. What is it then? I'd be carefree if it were that simple. You're making things complicated, Haru. I have nothing. I don't wanna see myself as pitiful. Because I'm not. I've got Naruto now. He's a gift from above. The third time's the charm. He's not the Naruto we wanted. You've lost your mind. Takeshi Tsukishima? Yes. I'm sorry for the trouble. As we spoke over the phone, we found her sitting on the curb about an hour ago. We didn't find signs of any incidents, so you may take her home. Please just sign these documents. I need to tell you something. What? The name "Naruto..." That's the name of our unborn son. This was before we divorced, so it's been more than ten years. But I had to tell you. Did you sleep with him? No. He only embraced me the whole time. He just hugged a babe like you all night and didn't make a move? C'mon, let's talk. I'll go first. Mikako, thank you for today, my show was perfect, great as always. Mikako, any past can be forgotten, let's discover your new self together. You don't belong to Kotaro. You're independent from anyone. My work will go well. There's nothing to worry about. Thank you always. I love you. I love you. I'll always love you. Say something. Come on. There's nothing to say. I can't say it. There's nothing I want to say. Say it. - Spit it out. - No. Even if... Even if I say something, will it fix anything? You're doing great. It's okay. You know... I'm a liar. Everything might be a lie. You've been wrong all this time. After I met you, I've changed. I've changed and... I've changed, right? - Right? - You'll get better. That's not it. No, that's not it! What about you? What about you? - We're fine. - You don't change? - Only me? - Calm down. Let's clam down. Deep breaths. Can you shut it off? Stop it! I love you. Who are you? And me... Who am I? I don't know... I feel so sick, I wanna throw up. Where's Kotaro? He's fine. And Takeshi? Where's Takeshi? I'm right here. I... I became a mother... I'm a mom, you know? And then... - You hear me? - Yeah. And then... only I went crazy. It's not just you. I'm the only one that went crazy. I'm here for you. What're you doing? What? Say something, say it right! I said, I love you. That's not it. What's wrong with you? Takeshi... Takeshi, can you hear me? I hear you. Do you see me? I see you. Really? Hey... Look. Look at me. You'll be fine. Takeshi, where are you looking? I want to get away. I want to get away. It's the next stop. It's been ages since I pulled an all-nighter. I'm exhausted. Maybe we'll see the sunrise? Maybe soon. I wanna see it from the beach. Let's go. Uh-oh. How's Mikako? Takeshi hasn't told you? I see. I haven't spoken to her since that night. Do you still love her? She's not easy to forget. I'm going to study again when Ran's done with her study abroad. Oh, really? I failed as a doctor. True, but you're a human before you're a doctor. As a human being, I hurt you, as well. It's inevitable if you've fallen in love with someone else. I don't know if it was all for the better. It was the only choice for you. I wanna stay in touch with Ran. Even if I'm not her mom, I want to watch over her. Okay. Promise me in writing. Okay. I'm glad to hear that Naruto's safe. Yes, but after he called, I lost contact with him. Here. Oh, I gave him this. So you were meeting with him. Just once. How long was he with you? About three months. What was Akira like? To me, he's Naruto. Oh, I understand. Naruto seemed lonely. At first, I thought it was the amnesia, but I slowly realized that that wasn't the reason. To me, Akira was like the sun that could brighten any moment. But I was only around 'til he was ten. Have you told him that? Tell him what? That he was like the sun. I might have killed Akira. What do you mean? I abandoned my wife and Akira once. I see. Akira told me that I should do as I please. I see. Maybe he was killing himself inside to say that to me. I did a horrible thing as a father. I think it's fine. Because you did what you want, Naruto is doing the same. That's why he's not coming back. I know some things because I used to be a child. I was very happy to live together with Naruto... because I couldn't give birth to him. What do you mean? It's okay. Born or not, he was there with me even if it was just for a moment. Akira is a great kid. I'll search for him. I see. I'll let you know if I find him. No, that's not necessary. What do you mean? I think it's time. Third Time Lucky English Subtitles: Haruna Yokoyama
