You laugh like you're still five years old. You look like you're still five years old. I know. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Be honest with me. Is there any part of you that feels just, like, a little bit silly for still doing this in our 30s? Are you kidding? It's tradition. Besides, our wishes always come true. I'd be silly not to. Yeah, it's a good point. Okay. - What'd you wish for? - I don't want to say! - What?! Why not? - 'Cause it's embarrassing. More embarrassing than wishing you could dye your hair pink for prom? Uh, no, yeah, I think this is actually more embarrassing than that. Okay, we'll say it at the same time then. On the count of three. Come on. Okay. Okay? One... two, three! I wish to meet my soulmate. What? Actually? Oh my gosh. No way! I cannot believe that we made the exact... same wish. After all these years, we're still so connected. Even living far apart. I really miss you. It's hard being away from you. And Mom and Dad, I guess. At least we know that every year, no matter what, we're both coming home for Christmas. - You promise? - Promise. Oh! 'Kay, let's wish. Are you kidding me? Wait! Wait! Uh... Um, how much for the car? Uh, sorry? The car. How much do you want for it? Yeah, I don't think that's how it works. No. Please. You don't understand. My sister is getting married and her wedding dress fitting is this afternoon. I need to be there and you literally hold the keys to that happening. - Where are you headed? - New York City. Okay, well, it just so happens that I'm headed there too. Can I come? You're willing to ride in a car with a stranger for hours just to go to a dress fitting? Yeah, I would do anything for my sister. And Christmas has kind of always been our special time together. And I really don't want to miss a second of it. Please. Okay. You can ride in the car with me... But, but, but... On one condition. Now, I know it's gonna sound a little lame, but I'm planning on listening to the Central Park Caroller's Christmas album until we get there, on a loop, so you have to be okay with that. I love the Central Park Carollers. What... really? Most people haven't even heard of them. I'm Cara. Chace. Wow. Um... Did you make this? It is... I did. It's hand-made. I know, I know. Here, let me get your bags. Oh. Thanks. So, there we are racing all over town. The clock is ticking. It is starting to look dire. So, in a moment of sheer desperation, we end up getting a tree from one of those street vendors. Total Charlie Brown moment. That's why you gotta go to the 34th Street lot. Oh, trust me, I'm never making that mistake again. Well, I guess this is goodbye then. - Yeah. - I gotta say, that felt like the fastest six hours of my life. I was thinking the exact same thing. And I can't believe you and your sister go to the riverside snowman building contest every year and that we... Never run into each other. Yeah! I would have remembered you. Uh, speaking of our many common interests... I'm planning on hitting up Pete's Cafe for the... Peppermint hot cocoa. Yes. Yeah. And I was hoping, maybe I'd see you there. Absolutely. Okay. Great. Um... Take my number. Text me and we... will make a plan. Okay. Say congrats to your sister for me. I will. The wedding's on the 24th. I know this is crazy, but I don't have a date. And we just got along so well and so... - I'd love to. - Really? Yeah. Yes. Just to clarify, I'm asking you to my sister's wedding as my date. Yeah. I got that. Okay. Cool. Well, I'll text you 'cause... I've got your number now. Okay. Uh... I'm glad I met you, Cara. I am so sorry! No! What? You just kicked my phone into the sewer! - I did? - Yes! What was your phone doing in the middle of the sidewalk? I was twirling and then I dropped it, okay? You were twirling? Doesn't matter, now it's gone. Well... look. Maybe we can still... Yeah. It's gone. Of course it is. Thanks a lot! Uh... Amy! I'm here! I'm sorry I'm late. Oh, that's okay. I'm just really glad you're here. You hate it? I knew it! I knew it. Is it... Amy, you're perfect. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, I guess it's not bad, huh? Oh, okay, I'm really, really happy that you're here. Have I said that? I wouldn't miss it for the world. Although I almost did. What? So anyway, wow. Now the phone's gone and I have no way of contacting him. - Huh? - Yeah. Which kind of stinks because I sort of invited him to your wedding. Uh, you what? - I know. - How? - Well you don't understand... - Oh! The connection! It was... magical! Wow, Cara! Wow. Chace loved these cookies. Oh yeah? That's it. What, you're gonna leave a trail of shortbread crumbs so that he can find his way back to you? Yeah, kinda. If we just go to all of our usual Christmas spots, I'm bound to run into him eventually. Um, okay, right. I've been meaning to talk to you about that. I can't come with you. It's just, with the wedding coming up, I have so much on my plate and I... Oh, please don't be mad... No. - I'm so sorry. - No. I'm not mad. Of course I'm not mad. This is your wedding we're talking about. And I'm here to help. Whatever you need. Thanks. But hey, this shouldn't stop you. I mean, if Chace is your soulmate, you gotta find him. I'll make a list of all our spots. There she goes. Chace. Michael. You know we can't publish this, right? Why not? I feel like it's some of my best work. Well no one's saying it's not good, but it just wasn't the assignment. Do you really think that people want to read and entire article on why New York's pizza's better than Chicago's? This... this has heart, and history, and drama, and intrigue! Like... isn't that what people want to read? No. Look. You're a great writer. Probably the best we have. But you have to learn to write within our parameters. No more think pieces. Okay. What've you got for me? - It's a top ten list. - No. - Michael! - Okay, fine. Yeah, yeah. Top ten. I love it. Okay. What are we talking, huh? Best bagels in Brooklyn? Martinis in Manhattan? It's about Christmas in New York. You know I haven't spent Christmas in the city in years. I need you to prove to me that you can do this or that's a conversation I don't want to have with you. Fine. Christmas in New York. - Morning, Mom. - Morning sweetheart. How'd you sleep? Like a baby. Mom! Mom. Emergency. Our dance instructor broke her leg skiing. Who's gonna choreograph our first dance? Um, don't panic. Mrs. Gardener, who lives down the street, teaches Zumba. Trust me, she is phenomenal. Okay, Mrs. Gardener, I'll put that in the maybe pile. - Bad news. - What? - My parent's flight is delayed. - But the fitting. Don't worry, I've already rescheduled. What about the tasting? We don't need them for the tasting. Besides, you know my Dad's idea of fine dining is pigs in a blanket dipped in grainy mustard. Yeah, you're right. He has terrible taste. And how did you sleep, sugar plum? - Like a baby. - I'll just have to try one... Gary. How many times do I have to tell you, these are for Chris' parents. Who, by the way, you have to pick up at the airport at... what time, Chris? Uh, tomorrow. 3:45. Ooh, before I forget, Cara, how are the monogram and menu designs coming? They're going great. In fact, I was thinking I would head to Pete's Cafe to work on them today. Pete's Cafe, huh? Hoping to run into Mr. Chace, are we? Chace? Who's Chace? He's no one. Ooh, does somebody have a date? Is he your boyfriend? Okay, I am leaving now. Love you. Love you too. Okay, this dough needs help. Would you please pack the cookies? Okay. - Oh well. - Gary! I can see you. Another round? Make it a double. No sign of him, huh? Wow, that's pretty good. Are you an artist? Uh, graphic designer. Well actually I'm not. I wish I was though. It's a competitive field. Well then, start competing. And I'll go pick up your double peppermint hot cocoa. What's the assignment this week, Ace? It's a top ten list. New York's top ten hidden gems, Christmas edition. Yikes. No offence, but couldn't they find anyone who was more qualified? Right? Now I have to cancel my flight and actually spend Christmas here. Exhausted just thinking about it. Okay. Sounds like you can use a double shot, double whipped cream, candy cane eggnog latte? I'll get you your regular. You're no fun. For you. Thanks, Pete. You know you really should try one of his seasonal drinks... You? Phone girl. What are you doing here? Uh, I'm... working. Having coffee. Hanging out with my buddy Pete. Um, I'm actually glad I ran into you here. I feel really bad about what happened, can I buy you a coffee, make it up to you? Yeah, I guess that would be okay. Uh, I can also replace the phone. No, I bought a new phone. It's the contents of the phone that can't be replaced. They're irreplaceable. Hold on. You mean to tell me that Michael is the one who kicked your phone into the sewer? Okay, how'd you know about that? Okay, I know about everything. You sir, may have lost this woman her soulmate. Wait, what? - So there's this guy... - There's always a guy. We met yesterday and we drove from Pittsburgh to New York together and I am not being dramatic when I say that he's the one. She even invited him to her sister's wedding. - After knowing him for one day. - You don't understand. We connected on every level. But every year, they do the same niche Christmas activities. I was hoping that I was gonna see him at the riverside snowman building contest tomorrow. You need a partner. Don't have any family and friends that could go with you? No. Most of my friends have gone home for the holidays and my family is completely wrapped up with my sister's wedding. Which, of course, but... Well, that's tough. Michael will go with you. - I'm sorry, what? - You kind of owe her. Oh, no, it's okay. Hear me out. Michael here is a writer who is currently doing an article about Christmas in New York. Which he knows nothing about, seeing as how he's avoided Christmas in the city for the last ten years by fleeing to Aruba. And you're a Christmas enthusiast who needs a partner for a snowman building contest so you can find the love of your life. You see what I'm getting at? Can you excuse us for a moment? Yeah. P- What are you doing? No, what are you doing? You should be jumping at this opportunity. She could basically write the article for you. - Yeah, but she... - Look, you can't afford to lose this job. And you know diddly-squat about Christmas in the city. The universe is handing you everything you need. Cara! So? I'm in. Snowman building contest. As long as I can come along to all the other... activities for the article. Okay. I'm just not exactly sure what I'm getting out of all of this. Cara here is a budding graphic designer who needs an in. And I happen to know that Michael is good friends with the editor of Evergreen Graphics. Evergreen Graphics? That's the best firm in the city. Wait. You can make a connection, can't you Mike? Yeah. Mm-hmm. I can. Uh, cool. See you tomorrow, Riverside Park, 2PM? That'll be three-fifty. That'll be three-fifty. Yeah. No problem. See you tomorrow. - Okay. - Bye Pete. - Bye. - Bye. Ellen, Patrick, okay. Okay, we are making progress, right? - Yes. - I think we really are. - Yes. - And we just have to... Janice! Okay... hmm. Now, I can't put aunt Janice next to cousin Joey after the volleyball incident, 2018. - Definitely not. - So, where do I put Janice? We got another late RSVP from your uncle George. Ugh! That throws everything off! Why don't we put... Ted next to Felicia. George next to Margot. And Joey all the way over here next to Liane? You know they'll just talk each other's ears off about their love of... building model airplanes. Oh my gosh, okay, this makes sense. What would I do without you? - I don't know. - Stop! You guys are too cute for my single heart to handle. Well I thought you were bringing your soulmate to the wedding, no? He's even got a pin on the chart. Yeah, he's right there. Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves, I still have to find him. How's the search going, anyways? Well, he wasn't at Pete's today. But I did manage to find myself a partner for tomorrow. So, hopefully I'll see him there. A partner? Who? It's kind of a long story, but this guy Michael wants to tag along, he's writing some article about Christmas in New York. So you're just gonna build a snowman with a total stranger? A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. Besides, if we don't find him, your entire seating plan will be off. Oh, well we can't have that, can we? No, no, no, we can't. Thank you so much Gladys, you're an absolute doll. Yeah, I can't wait to tell them. Tata. Well, great news. Mrs. Gardener is happy to be your new dance coach. Aw, that's so great Ma. Thanks. Oh. Before I forget, did you manage to call Ruby's about the cake? Yes. Uh, they said it will be ready in a couple of days. But of course, I also have to get my mani-pedi and I have to pick up my dress and I have to have the final menu meeting with the caterer. Ah, Chris, because you're a scientist, can you build me a time machine please? Sorry babe, I don't think they have that technology yet. Also, I'm a biologist, so it's not really what I do. Okay. Then what good are you? Well, I'm pretty good at the seating charts. That's true. I guess I have to keep you. - I guess you do. - Uh, I can pick it up for you. - Actually? - Yeah. Thank you. It is a three- tiered gingerbread wedding cake, the one that I've been dreaming about since I was a little girl. Yeah. You've talked about it a few times. Hey. Hey. Can't believe you showed up. That was the plan, right? Yeah, I just really didn't think you'd come. I do have an article to write, so... Yeah, no, I know. I'm glad you're here. Yeah, I'm glad I came too. - I guess we should... - Uh, yeah. Hi. Sorry, you... you go. Do you wanna put that away? Yeah. Sure. Wow. This is no joke. Yeah, it's serious business. People go all out. Yeah. Hi, Nadine. Looking good, as usual. She is so smug. She thinks she's all that just because she minored in Art History. Isn't this supposed to be a two-person competition? Yeah, that's the other thing. Every year, she sends her partner to go get hot chocolate, and then they never come back and she does the whole thing herself. Okay. This looks like the spot. Great. Okay, I'm getting down. So... Time to mitten up. Okay. Where are your mittens? I have my gloves. You wore fingerless gloves to a snowman building contest? It's all I have. And they're great for taking notes. You can't build a snowman with fingerless gloves, you'll get frostbite. You should put that in your article. I'll be fine. Okay. I like him. He's got character. Might as well just hand the prize to Nadine. Hey, don't go giving up so easy. Ours can't be the worst one. Check out the competition. What? What are you looking at? That's his scarf. - Really? - Yeah! How many people do you know that would wear a red checkered snowman scarf? We're on the right track. I just know we're gonna find him on the next one. Michael, please find attached my portfolio, I know I don't have much but... I hope that what I do have speaks for itself. See you tomorrow. Hey. Mom and Dad just left for the Nutcracker. Let's do this. Okay, I have to remember which ones I've actually wrapped already and which ones I still have to finish. Um... How fast can we do it? Where are your Christmas pajamas? Oh, yeah, no, Chris got me these for my birthday. Aren't they nice? Yeah, it's just, we always wear matching PJs at Christmas. Um, no, I know. I guess I just thought these were a little bit more me. Yeah. They're great. I'm kind of jealous. You can borrow them. It's kind of wild to think it was just a year ago that we made the wish. A lot has changed in a year. Mm-hmm. It really has. Can I tell you a secret? Mmhmm. Um, when I made the wish, I wasn't picturing Chris. What were you picturing? I don't know, somebody more like me, somebody more like the guys I dated in the past. I know, um... And then Chris came along and... It just sort of worked, you know? You guys are really great together. I like to think so. I think you should make your wish with Chris this year. - What? - Yeah. Really? I think he'd really like it. Okay. - Oh! Another bulls-eye, okay. - Yes! You win again. One more round, come on, Uncle Chace. I'll tell you what, why don't you go find your mom and tell her I'm gonna come visit for dinner tonight, okay? - Okay. - Alright. - We made it! - Yeah. Okay. You'll be needing these. What's this? Oh, thank you, that's very thoughtful. Well, you know, it'd be pretty hard to write your article when you can't feel your fingers. - Alright. - It's okay, loosen up. Let's have some fun! - It's not exactly my idea of... - Yeah, alright, you're ready. My idea of fun, but okay. Okay, I'm more of a soccer guy myself. Okay, okay. Wow! Good job! - Thanks. - Okay. Alright. Warm up's over. Give me a snowball. Oh. Ah, okay. - Yes! - Wow! You're making us look bad. Yeah, I know. This baby's going downtown. You just need to stop trying so hard. You think it's so easy, well why don't you try? Alright. - Come on! - Nice! We're almost here. Alright, what am I looking at? This is my favourite Christmas market in all of New York. Huh. Look. It's you. Ha. What? Oh, is that him?! Shh! It's too soon to tell. You're right. Looks handsome. How can you tell? It's just the back of his head. I don't know, I just... I'm nervous. Why am I nervous? - It's not him. - Oh. Shucks. Hey, he's pretty handsome though. If you don't find the real Chace, you could always go for that guy. What did I tell you? I'm not giving up. Aw no, not again. What? The Christmas photographer's here. It's like, the best part of the market. They have backdrops and props. - No. No. - Really? I do not photograph well. It's a bad idea. Well, I find that hard to believe. What? You know what I mean. - Yeah? - Oh, whatever. No, no, um, elaborate please. - Fine, I'll go alone. - No, far be it for me to deprive the world of this... photogenic face. - Like a reindeer... - Ah! My eye! So good, yes, yes. I told you. Okay, come on. I told you, I'm not that photogenic. It's Chace. - What? Where? - Here. He was just here. This kid looks kind of familiar. I can't believe that we missed him again. Okay. You're Chace. Where do you go next? I know just the place. Say, these gloves do make a difference. I can almost feel my fingers again. Well, you're welcome. Thank you! Hold these. Wow. You are very prepared. You're like the Boy Scouts of Christmas. Thank you. Oh. Cheers. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ Round yon virgin Mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace Snow really came down again. I know, but it was so magical. ♪ Five golden rings ♪ Four calling birds Three French hens ♪ ♪ Two turtle doves and a... ♪ - What are you doing? - Aw. ♪ Two turtle doves and a... ♪ I don't know. A partridge in a pear tree. Aw, right! You know, it was on the tip of my tongue. You know, it's really coming down, maybe we should think about... I love this city! Hey, can I ask you a question? Mm-hmm. If you love this city so much, why did you leave? It's a tale as old as time. Move for a guy. - That old chestnut, huh? - Yeah. Then you stayed there? Yeah, the company that I work for has promised me a position in graphic design eventually. But I'm starting to think that eventually is never gonna come. Well hopefully my friend Phoebe will come through for you. Yeah. Hopefully. Okay. So, let me ask you this. What is about this particular concert that keeps you coming back? Well, I think the music speaks for itself. But it's also a tradition. - Right. Tradition. - Mm-hmm. What is about traditions that gets everyone so worked up over Christmas? Well, Christmas is the one time of year that you get to be together with everyone you love. And then the traditions have this incredible power to transport you back to the happiest memories with those people. You okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? You sure? I'm sure. That's really well put. You mind if I put it in the article? Right, the article. How's that going by the way? Well, the fact that it's going at all is because of you. Explain to me again why you're writing an article on a topic you clearly have no interest in? Oh, if I could only explain that myself. Wasn't my choice. Kind of a long story, but... let's just say I'm not the best at sticking to the parameters of the project. I actually used to dream about writing a novel. After I graduated, I fell into this job, and... it's an expensive city. - Yep. - Grateful for the work. But now years have gone by and I feel like I've lost touch with why I started in the first place. Then write your novel. What's stopping you? It's not that easy. You gotta have a publisher, an editor, and... And what? Well, I guess if I'm being honest, um... Maybe I've lost a little confidence. I've been writing fluff for so long that I don't know if I still have what it takes. Well, you won't know unless you try. And there's no better time to take a leap of faith than Christmas. While I appreciate your unrelenting faith in the Christmas... No, hear me out. Every year my sister and I make a Christmas wish, and they always come true. And what did you wish for last year? Well, if you must know, both Amy and I wished to meet the man of our dreams. What? I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh, I, uh... You can think whatever you want to think, but every year, our wish comes true and this year is no exception. And maybe if you opened yourself up to a little bit of Christmas magic, it would work for you too. Maybe we'll agree to disagree. Maybe we will. See you tomorrow? You bet. - See ya. - See ya. Good morning. Oh. Darling, I can't wait for you to see the dresses I had them pull for you. You are gonna be a show stopper. That Chace fellow won't know what hit him. Yeah, okay, so really quick, I kind of agreed to let Mom pick out some dresses for you. So... You're a stylist, how could you do this to me? I know that, but she is our mother and she insisted and then she got so excited and then, you know, so... we just need to humour her, okay? But don't worry, I had them set aside a dress I know you're gonna love. Hey! Tada! Ooh! I can tell. Yeah, she knows. Let's try this. It's very... blue. Oh, it's just awful. Okay, good. Do we all agree this is not the one? No. No, it's not gonna work, hold on... What about... Oh my gosh, hey. You forgot about this one. Maybe this one? She should just try it and then see. - Mom, great taste. - I know, right? Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Thought I'd bring you a little Christmas inspiration. But from the looks of it, you don't need any. I don't know. Something Cara said yesterday, it sparked something. It's just been flowing out of me. I gotta say, when I suggested this little arrangement, I never imagined it to be such a success. What do you mean? Look at you. You're enthusiastically writing an article about Christmas. She's clearly had quite the effect on you. Okay, I wouldn't go that far. Alright, I'm working on a deadline here. Okay, whatever you say. So, what's on the agenda today? I don't know, actually. She likes everything to be a surprise, so... Yeah, I'm supposed to meet her at... Right now. Shoot, I gotta go. I'm late. Alright, but first you have to try my drink. Okay. Oh! Um... Like candy cane? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's, uh... Not my thing. Good try though. Don't listen to him! - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wow. Oh, wow. I... I'm speechless. It's beautiful. Well hello. Who's this? Michael. Hi. Hi. Um, Michael, who's... Oh, Michael. So nice to meet you. Oh my gosh, I am so sorry, I completely lost track of time. I'm gonna go change. That's all good. Uh, so... you're the writer? That would be me. And you must be the sister. Yes. Well, congrats on the upcoming nuptials. - Oh, thank you. - I'm the mother. Ah. Yes. I was putting that together, yeah. Uh, so what are you two up to today? Ah, I couldn't say. Apparently it's a surprise. Wow. Well, my sister is just full of surprises isn't she? She certainly is. Okay, I'm ready. Okay, I'm ready. Mom, thank you. Amy, I love you. Michael, let's go. Okay. Uh, nice to meet you ladies. Okay. Okay. Who is... Michael. Wow. Okay, are you gonna tell me where we're going because I'm starting to fear for my life. What is this? Oh, it's only the most exclusive Christmas tree lot in all of Manhattan. Only the best trees from the best nurseries are sold here. And I figured, since you don't have one... Okay, I'm picking up what you're putting down. Let me introduce you to Giles. Who's Giles? He's just my Christmas tree guy. Come on. Cara! Hey! - Good to see you! - Hi. Michael here is in the market for a tree. Oh, well what kind of tree are we looking for? Little balsam? Douglas? Maybe an East Himalayan? West Himalayan? Korean? Red, silver? Uh, I don't really know- - He hasn't had a tree for years, I think he might need a crash course. Well now, let's start with our basic Fraser Fir, one of our most fragrant, I might add. Isn't that right, Cara? Cara? Oh, yes, absolutely. Would you two excuse me for just one second? Sure. Ah! You scared me. - You abandoned me! - I did not! Giles is the best in the biz, you should be so lucky. Yeah, he's trying to sell me a 300-dollar tree. Yes, they can be a little expensive, but they're worth it. And who said you need to get one that's ten feet tall? This one is perfect for you. It's kind of cute I guess. Kind of cute? Okay. This is the tabletop Norwegian Spruce. It's a great starter tree. Alright. Alright. How much is this... Actually, nevermind. Don't tell me. It does smell pretty good. Oh, ain't that beautiful? There you go. It's the winner, right there. Let me wrap this up for you, hang on. So, uh, where'd you run off to anyway? Oh, I thought I saw Chace, but he disappeared. - Really? - I couldn't catch up to him. Oh. Sorry. You know what? I think I'm gonna leave him a little bread crumb. A what? There. Now, he'll have my number. And you're sure he's gonna pick this exact tree? No, but if it's meant to be, he'll find it. - Oh. - Here you go. Thank you. What do I owe you? You know what? Merry Christmas. - Really? - Yeah. Giles! Anytime, anytime. I'll see you soon? - Yes. - Okay. - Thank you. - Take care. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Hey, um... I don't know about you but I'm feeling kind of cold. And I did see some cozy-looking firepits and some eggnog we could sip on. You wanna hang out here, see if he comes back again? Really? You don't mind? Well, you did help me pick out the perfect... Okay, yeah, yeah, sounds great! Oh, you came back? So? It's good. - And you like eggnog. - Mm-hmm. Gotta say, you are one confusing man, Michael. Hey, never said I didn't like anything to do with Christmas. I actually used to love it. It was my dad's favourite holiday, we'd go all out. In fact, uh... What? I... nevermind. No, I wanna hear it. Hey, it's Phoebe from Evergreen. What did she say? Sorry. Um... Said that your stuff looks promising, but there's not enough in the portfolio to move forward. Yeah, can't blame her. They need someone with experience. Don't give up, okay? I've seen your stuff. You're really good. Thanks. And thanks for trying. I really appreciate it. Look... I'm sorry my end of the bargain didn't exactly hold up. If you want to call it, I'd understand. You've already given me a really good start to the article, so... No, don't be silly, I told you that I would help and I'm gonna see it through. Turns out your company is not so bad either. I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little peckish. Um... Grab us a few of those gingerbread cookies. That would... Wait. Gingerbread! Uh, I think they have shortbread too, if you're... What time is it? Uh, quarter to five. Okay, we need to go. Grab the tree. I have to go. Oh, here. Bye. - Thanks! - Nice to meet you. Uncle Chace, Uncle Chace, can you grab this one? I don't know, buddy, it's pretty big. Do you think it'll fit? Yes, it will fit! Please, please! Alright. Uh, yeah. Yes! Yeah! Okay. We're too late. I was supposed to pick up my sister's wedding cake. I can't believe I completely lost track of time and she trusted me with this and I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm sure she'll understand. It's the wedding cake. The entire wedding revolves around the cake. Some people only show up for the cake! Oh God, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I think I might have an idea. So, what? Pete's suddenly getting into the cake-making business? No. But we are. One peppermint hot cocoa, one black coffee. Actually, we have to use the kitchen. It's an emergency. Oh, you know where it is. Go for it. Okay, I appreciate what you're trying to do here, but I don't see how we can pull this off. I'm a terrible baker. Well, lucky for you, you're in the presence of a master baker. Uh... Ooh. I have said it once and I will say it again: you are a confusing man. For you. Mixing bowls. Alright. Let me show you how it's done. What are you doing there? Mixing. Yes, something, but if it's... You have to really smooth it out, so it doesn't get too lumpy. Kinda... It's good, though. I'm liking this. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's looking good, but that... That needs a little bit... Yeah, sift it. And you just kinda... Hit it on the side a little bit. Ooh. Okay. Just like that? Perfect. Just a little more. How'd you get so good at this? My family owned a bakery in Queens. Christmas time was always the busy time, so... I'd go into the kitchen, help out my dad. So, it runs in the family then. You could say that. I liked it, but it was really just an excuse to hang out with my dad. See, this is what I'm talking about. These traditions let you relive your fondest memories. Yeah. I guess, yeah. Sorry, did I... say something? No, no, no. Um... Just sometimes, these memories can be hard to relive. Just... why I tend to avoid 'em. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... Oh, no, don't apologize. It's... It's just... My dad and I... We were really close. He died when I was a teenager around Christmas time, so it's... a little hard to be around the city this time of the year. It's just a lot of memories. You know? Yeah. I'm so sorry, I didn't even consider... Don't... don't apologize. I have spent years trying to avoid reliving this, thinking that it was going to be hard. But I don't know, just since I'm... running around the city with you, reliving all this stuff, it... I feel like I'm reliving more good memories than bad. So... I'm so glad you're getting more than just an article out of all of this. Me too. Me too. I gotta say, this really is some of my best work. It's a shame I'm not gonna be able to sample my masterpiece. Well you should come with me then. - Where? - The wedding. How about Chace? The wedding's in three days. And you know, I'm starting to think that maybe it wasn't meant to be. I'd love to. Are you sure? Yeah, you know. I'm gonna go with someone. I'm sure I could do a lot worse than you. Thought you too could use a little pick-me-up. - Ooh! - Hey. Am I interrupting something? No. Okay. I'll just put these here and... leave. Thanks, Pete. See you, buddy. Thanks, Pete. - Hey. - Hi. How's it going? Um, could I get... one peppermint hot cocoa to go? One PHC, coming right up. That'll be 3.50, please. Right, thanks. Looking for someone? Uh, no. I mean... No, uh. Gotta go. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Actually, yes, yes, I am... I am looking for someone. Now, I know this is gonna sound kind of... kooky, but I'm looking for this woman, her name is Cara. We met a few days ago and we... Uh, we really hit it off and I gave her my number, so when I didn't hear from her, I kind of lost all hope, but then... Then... I found this, that's her. Uh, the number got smudged but she says she comes here every year for the peppermint hot cocoa. So, I was hoping that you might have seen her. I really don't know. Okay. That's okay. I knew it was a long shot, but hey, you never know. It is Christmas after all, right? I'll... Can I borrow your pen? Uh, yeah. Thanks. Uh... If you do happen to see her, would you mind giving her my number? You got it. Okay! Thank you. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Let me see it. Sorry! Let me see my wedding cake! What are you doing, skulking around, you creep? Let me see it. No means no. But... I can show you something else. Did you finish them? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, oh! Wow, Cara! You've really outdone yourself. Hey, I... I really can't thank you enough. For everything that you've done for this wedding. You're the best sister in the world. And I love you. I love you too. Stop. Wow, so pretty! I should put this in the fridge. Hey, Amy? Yeah? Um... You know the other day, that thing you said about how when you made your wish, you weren't imagining someone like Chris? Yeah. Well, when you did meet, how did you know he was your soulmate? I think it was when I realized that he was different than I knew. I mean, it wasn't immediate. Not like how it is in the movies, no love at first sight or any of that. Um... And he's my polar opposite in so many ways. But... I think our differences are what make us so compatible. I mean... He's my best friend and I feel so comfortable around him and... He also challenges me to grow. You know? Yeah. Why do you ask? I'm just... getting ideas for my speech. Oh, okay. - Good night. - Good night! Still in the throes of inspiration, I see. It's really coming together. Cara's been amazing. You have feelings for her, yes? What? No. Really? I don't. Okay, well you won't mind if I give her this, then? Where did you get this? He came in yesterday after you left. He said he found a photo strip. He actually found that... Apparently. So, you won't mind if I give that to her? Let me give it to her. I'm gonna be seeing her later anyway. Okay. Cara... Your wish is about to come true. Don't tell me you've never been ice-skating before. No, I've... I've ice-skated. You don't have to be embarrassed if your skating's not up to snuff. I can get you one of those little cones. Hey, I'm just kidding. I am no Michelle Kwan myself. No, it's just... I actually used to come here all the time with my dad. So, it's one of those memories, then. Well, we can go if you want to... No. No, I... I think it'd actually be fun. Alright, Michelle Kwan. Let's see what you got. It's like riding a bike, right? Yeah! Ooh! Oh. Do me a favour and don't try riding a bike anytime soon. Ha-ha. Okay You ready? Yeah, let's just go forward, yeah. - Okay. - There we go. This isn't embarrassing at all. Well, luckily for you, there aren't very many witnesses. Which is why I like coming here so much! You actually have room to skate! Ah, okay! Okay, you're turning a lot! How do you feel? Yeah, I think... Okay. Oh, oh! Okay. Okay, now we're dancing? I'm not prepared for both of these things. You know, good, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Look out! I survived. Ah, wow! That was really fun. Whoo! Okay. I still cannot believe that you and your dad used to come here. It was actually one of my favourite things to do at Christmas with my dad. Yeah? Yeah. Just be the two of us and afterwards, you pull out a thermos with some hot cocoa and we'd go over the hill and sit by the statue. I love that statue. Remind me who it is again? Uh, Charles Owen. My dad's favourite author. Hmm. Yeah, he always used to go over to the statue for inspiration. He'd sit there and write for hours. Your dad was a writer too? Aspiring. He was always so busy with the bakery, he never really had a chance to seriously pursue it, but... whenever he had a free moment, this is where he'd be. It's... actually his passion that inspired me to become a writer myself. Well I'm sure he'd be very proud of you. Yeah, I don't know about that. I write top 10s for a living. I don't think this is exactly what he... imagined for me. Or what I imagined for myself. Then write your novel. We've been over this. I know, I know. You need a publisher, you need an editor. And I also have a full-time job that takes up all of my time. You know what that sounds like? A whole lot of excuses. If this means something to you, you need to do it. Well, you're one to talk. Hey, I tried. She said no. Try again. You think Evergreen is the only graphic design firm in New York? And do you really want to spend the rest of your life in Pittsburgh, with a job you hate, hoping that one day, your dreams are just gonna fall on your lap? Cara. No, you know what, you're right. No, I'm sorry, I... I overstepped. No. No more excuses. For either of us. Come on. Come on! Okay, the whole surprise thing was very cute at first, but... can you please tell me where we're going? We're here. Hello! Mom? Is this where you grew up? Yeah. Wow. Festive. Come on! This way! Well, I'm starting to see where you get your Christmas cheer from. Oh yeah, we go all out. Clearly. You'll be needing this. Oh. Okay. Michael. Cara. Do you remember when I told you about my tradition with my sister? The Christmas wish? How could I forget? Well, it's time for you to make yours. Yeah, I don't know. Come on, it's worth a shot, right? And I'm writing mine too. Isn't this what you do with your sister already? This year, with the wedding and everything, things have been a little different. You know, it's two days 'till Christmas and time's running out. Uh... For me. What do I write? What do you mean, "What do I write?" The whole reason I brought you here was so that you could manifest your novel. You've never read any of my stuff, you don't know if I'm any good. I have the internet, I've done my research. Okay. And it means something to you. You know, everyone has a story to tell and... I think people would be lucky to hear yours. Okay. Okay. Done. So, what now? Pixie dust? Do we have to say a special incantation? Very funny. No, you have to roll it up. And then... pick one of these. Oh. It's a great sound. Now what? Now you hang it on the tree. That's it. Thank you. For bringing me here. For everything. I have not had a Christmas this special in a long time. I should be thanking you, this would have been a pretty lonely Christmas season without you. And even if we don't find Chace, it'll be worth it, 'cause I met you. Speaking of Chace, there's something I have to tell you. Um... Chris, don't forget the ice cream! He's so... Oh! Hello, Michael. Fancy seeing you here. Mom, you remember Michael. Dad, this is Michael. Hi. Uh, Cara's helping him write an article about Christmas in New York. Ah! Well, no-one knows Christmas better than my little sugar plum. Sugar plum? Michael! Why don't you join us for dinner? Ah, no, I don't want to... impose on you guys. Nonsense! Got enough takeout to feed an army. She's right. Are you sure? I... I'm cool with it if you're cool with it. Yeah, I... I'd love to stay. Oh, wow. Cara, these are incredible. That's a nice thing to say. Oh. The carollers? Mmhmm. Do you mind if I use this for the article? Yeah, sure. Great. Come on, you two! Okay, I will grab these and... After you. Thank you. Hello! Michael, sit by me. Okay! Thanks. Wow. This... looks amazing. Are we just like... Let's go in, let's go in. Yes Amy, it's all taken care of, I promise. Okay, I'm just at Pete's, getting a coffee and then, I'm gonna pick up my dress and then, I will be home. Okay. Bye. Cara. Chace! You're here. Yes, yeah. Wow. Uh, I'm so sorry I didn't call you, my phone got kicked into a sewer and... No, it's okay, it's okay. I figured something happened. I found the photo strip. Really? Yes. Yeah, the ink was smudged, but I've been looking everywhere for you. You have? Yeah, I went to all our places, I even made a list. I also made a list. Huh. What are you doing here? Oh, uh... I was dropping off some flyers. There's a violinist playing a charity concert at the Christmas tree lot tonight. So, here I am. Here you are. Wow. This is... I can't believe we finally found each other. You know, I even left my number here, hoping you'd stop by. Really? I wonder why Pete didn't... Uh, hey, Pete? Cara! Hi. Hi! And who is this? This is Chace. He said he left his number for me. Oh, yes, right! I thought I recognized you. Yeah... Right. So, why didn't you give it to me? I... Well... Pete? Okay, I gave it to Michael. Sorry, who's Michael? He's, um... no-one. Uh... Anyway, you're here now and this is so wild. Yeah. You know, I wish I could stick around and have a coffee with you, but I gotta get to my nephew. If you're free tonight, would you want to meet me at the Christmas tree lot for the concert? I would love to. Okay. Great, uh... We should probably exchange numbers. I'll take yours this time. There you go. So... Do you like it? Do I like it? I love it. Oh! Great. You've completely captured the magic of Christmas in New York. It just really, it makes me think of my childhood. And I didn't even grow up here. Phil, I don't even know what to say. Um... You're fired. I'm sorry, what? You and I both know that you're too good for this job. This article confirms that. But if no-one's pushing you, you'll never achieve your full potential. So, here's me pushing you. Well, I appreciate your confidence in me. Phil, I do. I need a job. What am I gonna do? You're gonna write! I have a friend in publishing who I think you should meet. Expect a call from him sometime this week. Thank you. I don't even know what to say. Merry Christmas, Michael. Merry Christmas, Phil. Coming! Michael. What are you doing here? I got fired. I'm sorry to hear. No, it is a good thing. My boss wants me to go and write my novel. It's great news, Michael. Congratulations. Is everything okay? Actually, I have news of my own. Oh yeah? Yeah. I went to Pete's today and you'll never guess who I ran into. Chace. I ran into Chace. Oh. Yeah. Cara, uh... I can explain. Okay, I would love to hear it. Well... Pete only gave it to me a few days ago. A few days ago? I meant to give it to you. But you didn't. You kept it from me and you lied to me. No, I... always meant to give you the number, it's just... I started to feel that... Feel what? There was something happening between us. I'm so sorry, I... I made a mistake. I tried to give you the number and I'm... You didn't try hard enough, you should have said something. You know, now it's too late. We spent the last week running around the city, hoping to find your soulmate. Mmhmm. So, forgive me if it never quite felt like the right time. And to be honest, I wasn't sure how you felt... but obviously, I was wrong. What if I... What if you what? It doesn't matter now because I can't trust you. So, there's no way... you can give me another chance? Cara... Merry Christmas, Michael. And what did I see? There it is, a picture of you, just sitting there. I couldn't believe my eyes. I honestly cannot believe that it actually worked. Michael was so sure that you would not find it, but I knew deep down that you would. Right, uh... And Michael, I'm assuming is the guy in the photo? Yeah. But he's out of the picture now. Oh, I didn't realize that you two... No, we aren't. We weren't. Okay, got you. But enough about him, I want to hear more about you, how has your trip home been so far? Yeah, it's been great. I've been going around town with my nephew, Gregory, showing him a real, New York Christmas. We've been hitting all the spots. He doesn't know all the places, so I've been taking him around, I've been... We ran into a real-life abominable snowman... Thanks. Oh... Michael, I'm so sorry. No, don't apologize, it's not your fault. But it is. She caught me on the spot, I wasn't thinking, it just came out. Pete. It's okay. Okay? You gave me the number to give to her and... the rest is on me. So, what happened? She says she can't trust me. She's probably on a date with Chace right now. So what? You're just gonna give up? Give up on what? On Cara. There's obviously something between you. Something special. She brought out a part of you that I haven't seen in years. I'm not gonna stand by and watch you walk away from that. What am I supposed to do, man? Can't force her to want to be with me. Oh, and I got fired. What? Yeah. Michael. We need to talk. Turns out that Michael is this incredible pastry chef and we made the entire three-tier cake from scratch. Wow! Wow, that... Yeah. - That's very impressive. - Yeah. Uh. I had a really great time tonight. Me too. So, about the wedding, I was thinking that... Look, Cara, I really like you. You're great and we have so much in common and... I think if the timing was different, maybe... you could have been something great, but... it's clear to me that this isn't working out. Okay. Why? I think you know why. How's it going back there? You get tangled up again? I'm almost ready, just one second. Ta-da! Wow! What's wrong? You just... You look so beautiful. Okay, that's a nice try, but you were emotional before I even came out here. What happened? Hm. "Hi, again, Phoebe, I just wanted to follow up with some of Cara Martin's additional materials. While I respect your initial decision, it is my hope that these designs will help you see what a brilliant talent she is and give her a chance. I can personally attest to her passion and determination, and am confident she would make a valuable addition to your team. Best, Michael." She wants to meet in the new year. She thinks I have a lot of potential. Cara! This is amazing! Yeah, um, I just don't even understand how he got the wedding mockups. Um... Yeah, I might have had a little something to do with that. What was I supposed to do, okay? Pass up the opportunity to help my sister fulfill her dream and potentially move back to the city? Not to mention make her Christmas wish come true? You know, things didn't work out with Chace. I'm not talking about Chace. Doesn't make any sense, though. It's... - You're polar opposites. - Yeah. I think sometimes, your soulmate is the person you least expect. He lied to me, though. I can't trust him anymore. He told me that he tried to give you Chace's number. I really think his heart was in the right place. I mean, some love stories are just complicated. Enough about me! This is your day! Ooh, okay, but I'm dropping this just for now, because it's not over, okay? Oh! Wow. You do look beautiful. I kind of do, don't I? Yeah! Wow, the veil. It's almost time. Okay, I'll meet you down there. Hi. Hi. Look, Michael, I... Before you say anything else, I need to apologize to you again. Amy invited me to the wedding, but if you don't want me to be here... No, no, no, I want you to be here. And I should be apologizing too, I was so caught up in finding some guy I barely knew that I completely missed what was right in front of me. Oh, you two made up! That's great. You should... Yeah, I'm gonna go. Yeah, yeah. Okay! Okay. Wow. Ooh, it's all happening. I love you. I love you. Amy, I love you so much. That's only because I could not have imagined somebody so kind, so caring, so handsome... and so generous as you. So? Big interview coming up. Mmhmm. You nervous? A little. It's only my dream job, so... You know, trying to manage expectations. But it seems like your Christmas wish is already coming true, so... Hmm... How are you so sure you know what I wished for? You mean to tell me that you didn't wish for your novel to get published? That is exactly what I'm saying. Then what did you wish for? Can I? One, two, three! Oh my gosh, you're kidding! There's no way you made this! Well, I had a little help. It's beautiful! I love it so much. Alright. Cheers! - To the happy couple. - To the happy couple. - Cheers. - Cheers. Subtitling: difuze
