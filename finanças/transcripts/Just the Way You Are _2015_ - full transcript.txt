--== McEphie ==-- [crowd cheering] [dance music playing] [crowd] Justin! Justin! [crowd] One! Two! Three! [crowd cheering] [dance music continues] -[Drake] So, game? -[Andre] Game! -[Drake] Let's go! -[Andre] Come on! Stop the party! -[crowd screams] -[music stops] All of you are under arrest... ...by our charm! -[Andre] And sexiness. -[woman] Oh, my God! It's Drake! Drake! [man] Okay, okay, okay, everyone. Calm down, okay? All right! To the ladies and lady wannabes, this is what you've all been waiting for. With every money you drop, they'll remove a piece of clothing. [ladies shriek] Okay. Whoever gets the most money wins... [both] ...the Strip Bet! [sensual music playing] [crowd] Drake! Drake! You know I'm your number one fan, baby. For you. Ooh... [crowd screaming] [crowd] Take it off! Take it off! [woman] Take it off! Here's some more. -[man] Come on, ladies! -Drake! I love you, Drake! How arrogant! Yes! I want more! [all clamoring] Take it off! [crowd] Boo! Boo! [crowd] Boo! [crowd] Boo! You're no match! [crowd] Get off! Get off the stage! [woman] Wait! What? [crowd] "If I win..." [man] Wait. Watch for it. "...you'll get a kiss from..." -[woman] Drake! -[crowd screaming] Take my money! One, two, three! [man] You won, dude! You lost, Drake! -What now, Drake? You lost. -I finally defeated Drake! Free kiss from Drake, everyone! [crowd shrieking] Free kiss from Drake, everyone! [Andre] Enough of that. I know that you all just want a picture with me. -[Marcus] You're really milking that win. -Thank you. See you later. Stop raining on my parade! Were you the ones who beat Drake? Ever since we started these bets, it's only now that someone has beaten him. -And that's me, of course! -But in the most humiliating way possible. I think those guys were just making fun of you. [Andre] I don't care. What matters is that I won. [Marcus] Yes! And we'll take advantage of this. -Actually, we've been thinking of... -Hi, guys. -Drake's punishment since last night. -Punishment? Can we just move on to the next bet? Anyway, your punishments are lame. [Andre] What? That's unfair! Do you still remember your punishment to me before? [sobs] You got someone pregnant? How could you do this to me, baby boy? -I'm sorry, Mom! -You're not my baby anymore! -I hate you! -Sorry, Mom! Mom! [Marcus] Mine's worse! [whistle blowing] [Ivan] Among us, I had the worst punishment! -Say it! -[sobbing] We're over. You're not that handsome! -Baby! -Who do you think you are? Baby, don't leave me! -You're crazy. -That's insane. Guys, just tell me what my punishment is. It's simple. Thirty days, dude. Thirty days to make a girl fall in love with you. And of course, I'll be choosing the girl you'll play with. Hold on! That's not even a punishment for Drake. Hey! I'm not done yet. As soon as she says I love you, you'll tell her the truth. That this is just your punishment in our bet. It's that simple. -[Marcus] What a new punishment! -It's brilliant! Especially when we tell you who the target is. [Ivan] Right? Who? [lively music playing] -[student 1] Run faster. We'll be late! -[student 2] You're so slow! Oh, you bumped into someone. Her! [student 1] She's not someone. She's going to fight back. -Peace! Let's run! -[student 2] Hey! You've got to be kidding me. Dude, seriously? Why? Aren't you an expert with girls? [Marcus] That's not even a girl. Dude, she's an alien. Out of this world. [Andre] That's why it's called a punishment. It's supposed to be hard. If you don't like her, we have another option. You'll play a magic trick on the quad... with your dad. [Marcus] Are you trying to insult him? Option two. Option number two. -One! -[all] One? I'll take punishment number one. [Marcus] Drake! Drakey. Drakey-boy. Come on. [student 1] What do you guys think of my earrings? -[student 2] Bea, I love your earrings. -Totally. I'm going to make Sophia Taylor fall in love with me. Hi, baby! [chuckles] All right! [bell ringing] -Hi, Driana! -[shrieks] -Oh, my God, Sophia! You almost killed me! -[chuckles] What happened to you? Where have you been? Work. [grunts] [Driana] Finish that, please. I thought you were getting those braces removed. Yeah. I was supposed to, but then I got too busy, so... Those stupid, K-Harmony leeches! What did they write again? -You don't have to know. -Come on. Well, at least, their spelling's right. But their grammar sucks. -Are you serious? -Apostrophe, R-E. [Chloe] What? There's an apostrophe between R and E? The rules have been changed! Oh, my goodness, Chloe! We have to go. Okay? -So just tell me... -Oh, right. if those bullies bother you again. I'll take care of them, okay? -Bye! -Bye! Driana, your brush! You need that more than I do. And here. -You're welcome. -Clean yourself up. You stink. -Bye! -Let's go! [woman] That's my only concern. The buyer wants to move in already. But we haven't sold all the furniture yet. [man] So, are you ready to fly? [woman] Everything's set. Mom is actually excited. She's been packing the entire week. [man] How about my daughter? Is she really not coming? I tried everything to convince her. [woman] Sophia! Sophia is here. Sophia, it's your father. Sophia, my dear. I'm just going to prepare Grandma's food. All right, I'll just keep you posted. [woman] Sophia. Are you sure you don't want to go back to the States? There's no reason for me to go back there. Our house is gone, along with our money... and Mom, too. Besides, I can't afford to study there, anyway. I'll go back when I'm ready to get my brother. I'm already saving for that. I don't want my efforts to be wasted. What will happen to you here? I have a job at the milk tea shop, so I'll get by. And, anyway, I've dealt with that already. I called my Mom's best friend, Auntie Veronica. I'm going to stay with her temporarily. And it's fine with her. Are you sure you're going to be okay here? Yes, Auntie. I'll be okay. Don't worry. [Sophia] Sir, pull over, please. I'll be a minute, sir. [thunder rumbling] Can I get a SIM card, please? Here. [Sophia] Thank you. Can you load it with 50 pesos worth of phone credits? [vendor] Okay. Thank you. Here's your change. It's been sent already. All right. Thank you. -[Veronica] Hello? -Hello, Auntie Veronica. [Veronica] Who's this? It's Sophia. This is my new number. [Veronica] Sophia, where are you? I'm sorry for calling just now. But I'm on my way already. [Veronica] All right, Sophia. I'll be waiting for you. Take care! [Sophia] Okay. Bye, Auntie. Thank you! [somber music playing] [Sophia] Here you go, sir. Please wait. [somber music continues] [grunts] [doorbell ringing] [Veronica] Sophia! Why are you standing there? -Dry yourself. -It might get wet. -No, it's okay. -Thank you. I apologize for calling late. It's okay. I just got home, anyway. I just came from a commercial shoot. I'm a makeup artist. If I don't have shoots, I manage our convenience store. It's just right outside the village. Sophia, I want you to feel at home here, okay? Okay, Auntie. Thank you. Come on. Let's go to your room. And this is your room! Sorry, Sophia. I forgot to remove some of my clutter. I'll have them out of here by tomorrow. No need. It's okay. I don't have that much stuff. Anyway, here. This is the bathroom. By the way, Sophia, this connects to the other room. So make sure to lock this door if you're going to use it. Because my son's best friend stays here most of the time. Got it. We have a pool in case you want to go swimming. [Andre] Mom! Who is... Baby! You're still up! This is Sophia, our new boarder. This is my son, Andre. I guess you know each other already? You're from the same school, right? Yes, Auntie. I see him on the campus. That's great! Perfect! You know what? Sophia's been in the country for three months now. She came from the States. So, basically, she's a newbie. So I want you to look after her, okay? [Veronica] Yes! You're such a good boy. Your armpit stinks. Haven't you showered yet? -Stop it, Mom. -Why? Pardon me. You know, I still consider him my baby. Even though he's all grown up now, he is still my choco yummy baby boy. I love you, baby! Even though you stink. Good night. Go to bed. Come. Let's go to the dining area. Let's have a chat. Good night, baby! I love you! [Andre] Dude! Come over. I'll just go tomorrow, bro. I don't feel like going out. All right. I'll just see you tomorrow at school, okay? I have a surprise for you. Stop it. You're making me blush. Jerk! [Driana] Hey, Dad! Don't forget about my tree planting next week. -[man] Honey, what do I have next week? -[Driana] You promised! [woman] I think you'll be busy. [man] Just kidding. Of course I'm going. I promised you that. -[Driana] Thank you! -[woman] Drake, there you are. Your dad surprised us. His flight got canceled. Sit down. Your favorite food is almost-- No, thanks, Mom. I'm going to Andre's. We have a group study. Group study? This late? I'm sure you and Andre have a bet. You know what, Dad? That friend of his is a BI. Quite the bad influence! Twinnie, you're just too uptight. -Whatever. -[woman] Drake... Why don't you excuse yourself from that group study? It's not every day that we're complete. I'm sure your friends won't mind. I'm sure Dad won't mind if I go. Right, Dad? Uh... yeah. We'll set aside some food for you. No need. I'm not going to sleep there. Drake! Drive safely! [Skye] I'm so glad that you found a place to stay. Yes. Good thing my mom's best friend is really kind. She allowed me to stay here. [Skye] But we both know that your best friend is kinder, right? By the way, I have a surprise for you. Surprise, Sophia! Matt! Matt! Matt! Oh, my gosh! Matt! Sophia, yuck! Yuck, your face! Can't I miss my baby brother? It's been a week since I last saw you. Oh, yes. Dad brought me on his trip with his friends. When are you coming home? Soon. I promise, Matt. Soon. I'm already saving money so I can go there and get you. And when that happens, we will never be apart. I promise. We're going to stay here in Manila. Okay? Really? Is Dad coming with us? Matt, I think it's getting pretty late already. I'll take you home, okay? Say goodbye to your sister. Okay. Bye! I miss you! Bye, Matt! [computer chimes] [somber music playing] [hip-hop music playing on stereo] [music stops] Dude, what are you doing here? I thought you were hanging out with your mom and Driana. Huh? Ah! I get it. Daddy's home, right? I'm tired, bro. Let's just talk tomorrow, okay? Dude! I have good news for you! I'm sure you'll like it. Mom had a visitor a while ago. It was so unexpected, dude! -Let's talk tomorrow, okay? -Wait! I have to tell you something. -[Andre] Dude! -[Drake] Good night! [playful music playing] [chuckles] [light pop music playing] [sighs] [humming softly] What are you doing here? Don't you know that someone's taking a shower? -[screaming] -Don't you know how to knock? What? What? Why? Oh! Oh... Oh, my God! -Can't a guy shower in peace? -[screaming] Come on, let me help you. No! You're the most disgusting guy in the universe! No! [groans] Not my room! It hurts! It hurts! Wait. How did it happen? Explain it to me. I can't understand how it all happened. How did your fist land on Drake's face? [laughing hysterically] Auntie, we startled each other. Ah! I wasn't informed that the other room was already occupied. -Let's eat! -Sorry, Sophia! He's the one I was telling you about. He's Drake, Andre's best friend. He's like my own son, that's why he feels right at home here. Boys, why did you eat all the hotdogs? Drake. Why don't you offer your hotdog to Sophia? [choking] -[coughs] -[awkward laughter] Do you want my hotdog? [stifled laughter] It's okay, Auntie. It seems like Drake really loves hotdogs. [Andre laughs] -[Andre] Giving up already, dude? -[Marcus] He hasn't done anything yet. Guys, our friend is forgetting something. Yes! The famous three-game plan. Yes. The STT. The Staring Game, the Touching Game, and the Texting Game. -See? -Come to think of it, bro... you haven't done the Texting Game. Fine. Okay. Enough talking. See this? Before it hits 12:00 noon, Sophia is mine. Hashtag... piece of cake. [quirky music playing] Hmm? -Looking for me? Hmm? -[inhales sharply] [Drake] Whoops! Careful! Let go of my hand. No. -[wrist twisting] -Ahh! [students laughing] [Sophia] There are other designs here. If you don't want too much design, I have plain ones here. They come in different sizes. [Sophia] Come on, girls. There's a lot to choose from. Get one for your moms or your sisters... How much? Hey! Wait! How much does it all cost? Three thousand, eight hundred and forty-five. Can you afford it? Hey, wait! Thanks for paying for everything! [student] Hi, Drake! -Hi, Drake! -Oh, my God! Drake! -Hi, ladies! -Hi, Drake. Yes, I was there with my chicks. [Ivan] Oh, really? Why haven't we met any of them? [Marcus] Or did you mean literal chicks? Yes. Finally. Oh, my... rawr. Something's missing. How about another black eye to even it out? [all laughing] Boom! Twelve noon, right? Hashtag... fart! [laughs] How can we recruit new members? Any suggestions, guys? I want to tell you something. You said you want to help the poor, right? Then join our org. The Chiguibels. -[Driana] Sophia, please. -Wait. [Driana] I know you have a good heart and you want to help the poor. So please. Let's help Chloe. -Please? -I'm so poor. -Sophia? -Okay, fine. -[Andre laughs] -[shrieks] Dude! Someone just broke your record! It's your first time to reach stage three. Texting game? You got ignored! It's okay. It's just the first day. -You have 29 days left. -Shut up! That girl is not human. [Andre] Just because she ignored you? Bro, all of my moves are not working on her! Your moves? You're just used to doing things your way. But, dude, just once, have you ever asked girls what they really want? Anyway, just tell me if you're ready to give up. It's that simple. [Andre laughs] [curtain rattles] Good morning, Twinnie! Breakfast in bed? [scoffs] What are you doing in my room? Unbelievable! Can't I get a "good morning" from you first? Why are you so grumpy this early in the morning? -My twin sister is very cute! -[Driana whines] [Drake laughs] I know you wouldn't be doing this if you didn't need something from me. So what is it? -Spill! -It's about Sophia Taylor. -No way! -Hey! Wait! I haven't said anything yet! I know you, Drake. I know you're just going to play with her emotions, just like you did with those other girls! And besides, tell me, why Sophia? I have nothing against her, she's my friend, but... Drake, she's not your type. You're so judgemental. -I just want to be friends with her. -I doubt it. I'm sure you're just going to play with her emotions. Unbelievable. Do you really think I'm that evil? Me, your very own twinnie? Your twin brother? I'm not a bad person, you know. Right, Cookie? I'm not, right? Right? [smooches] No! Come on, please tell me! What does she want? What's she into? How will I get her to notice me? Twinnie, please! You want me to save the whales? I'll help you! I will do everything. Anything! Please? [sighs] Fine! But... are you sure you're going to do everything I say just to get Sophia's attention? Mmm... You have to have those parental consent forms signed before returning them to-- [laughing obnoxiously] Friend! You have to see this! Come on! Let's go! I'm sure that when you see it, you'll go nuts! Oh, my gosh! Come on! Let's go! [laughs] I can't believe he fell for it! [laughs] What? -We're almost there! This is huge! -[Sophia] Chloe, wait! -Out of the way! -I don't understand -what you're saying! -Come on! Excuse me! This is our moment! Not yours! There! [Chloe] Hey! Handsome! Here she is! [crowd cheers] Oh, my! -He's really something. -Oh, my God! [girls screaming] [Drake] All right! Here we go! [Drake chuckles] Let's see if you can handle what she'll do. Slow down or I'll fall! Oh, my gosh! -Here she comes. -Here we go. You better not let us down, okay? [Chloe] I'll wait right here, okay? For you. -[crowd exclaiming] -[Chloe] Sweet! What are you doing? If this is your idea of a joke, it's not funny! Hey! Wait! -[Andre laughs] -[Drake] Excuse me! -Sophia! -Guys! Wait, Sophia! Just... stop! Just stop, all right? -[exhales] -I have to go. No, no, no! Didn't you like that? -Like what? -That! This! I thought you liked pink! And who told you that? Driana, my sister. Wow! [scoffs] I'm so stupid! [groans loudly] No! Wait! I'm really sorry, all right? Hmm? What's your problem? Huh? [scoffs] That! All that! All that stupid staring and texting! Why are you suddenly all into me? What's the catch? Isn't it obvious? I'm not stupid, Drake! You're that stereotypical jerk in those mindless teeny-bopper romantic comedies! Your moves, your games, your girls... So answer me. What's it about? I like you. -Hell no. -[Drake chuckles] Are you a lesbian? What did you just say? I said, "Are you a lesbian?" Did it ever occur to you that you're just really not my type? Okay, fine! Just tell me. How do I get you? How do I even win you? What's your secret? [breathing heavily] Well... Yes? That's a secret I don't tell little boys. Question is, are you man enough to find out? [scoffs] [Sophia] Thank you! I'll call when your order's ready. [mock crying] We're talking about Drake! Why, oh, why did you say no? [sighs] I don't have time to play those stupid games of his. Would you really call love "stupid"? [whimpers] -Love? Seriously? -Yes. Chloe, you just think it's love because you easily fall for the tricks of people like Drake. You shouldn't be so quick to trust them! For all we know, he and his friends are just having another bet! They're notorious for their bets! And you know how allergic I am to those stupid things. My friend, it's called "true love." It's not called a bet or a gamble. Love, bet, gamble... they're all the same. In the end, you'll always end up losing. Just take my mom, for example. She fell in love with my dad, she gambled on love, and what happened to her? She lost. -And now she's dead. -We're talking about death now? -My goodness! That was quick! -Excuse me. But what if Drake Sison is so in love with you that he's willing to die for you? -Are you serious? -Yes. He's in love with me? Just look at me. But don't they say love is blind, friend? Chloe, I have better things to do with my time. And my heart will stay where it is. Safe, and all mine. Well, keep your heart to yourself, then! I'll keep this bear to myself. A cute guy gave this to me earlier. -He's cute and sweet! -Order for Glenn! One thousand... four hundred... and seventy. Well? It's still not enough, is it? [Sophia sighs] I really want to bring my brother here now. [Skye sighs] Well... you know what, Pie? You can always go back to making music, right? Skye! You know very well that I'll never write another song again. I'll just find another sideline. Okay. Let's go to another store before the mall closes, okay? Twinnie! Hi! Thanks for picking me up! Pink? Wait! Drake! I just have to do one last thing before we leave. I just need to take these letters to that shop-- What the hell were you thinking? You made me look like a fool! [sighs] Okay, fine! At least now you know how it feels to be made to look like a fool. You see, Drake, you should never play with girls' feelings. Love isn't something you should toy with. -[scoffs] -But then again... Have you ever fallen in love? No! Do you even have a heart? I guess you don't. Do you even know anything about love? No, you don't! [sighs] Twinnie, don't you want to experience true love? [sighs] Don't you want to be in a relationship where you and your partner don't hurt each other? [Driana] You know? A relationship where your partner will take care of you. -That hurts! -Let's go. Wait! I still have to bring-- Mom has been waiting for us for hours, okay? Let's go! Novan, take care of these letters, okay? Come on, let's go! [Driana] You're avoiding the topic again! What the hell is your problem? Drake, thank you. I knew you wouldn't let your sister go home alone. -Hi, Mom. I'll go ahead. -Hi, Mom. Did you and your sister fight again? Don't worry, it's just the simple things. You know? You know us. We'd fight over something petty, but we'd patch things up in no time. Drake... Is everything all right, son? Of course. Where are your clothes? Let's have Marian take them upstairs, okay? -Marian! -Never mind, Marian. I won't be sleeping here, Mom. You're leaving again? Yes, Mom. Drake. I don't like that you rarely come home anymore. This is your home. I know that you feel very at home over at Veronica's house. But, son... we are your family. I hope you realize that your father and I worry about you, too. Drake... I feel that you're slowly drifting away from us. I want to know... is there some sort of problem? Is there something I need to know? [doorbell rings] [door opens] You guys are still up? You're here. -Hi. -Hi. I'll go ahead, Mom. Drake! We'll talk next time, Mom. Okay? I'll go ahead. [grunts] [somber music playing] Why are you keeping your problems to yourself, anyway? [Andre] You know you can tell your mom or Driana about your father's mistress, right? That way, you won't have to deal with that problem alone. I mean, just look. Tonight, you'll be sleeping here again. You talk too much. Look, I'm just doing this for the bet, okay? What? -Sophia is living here, right? -Yes. I want to be close to her to get this punishment over with and to prove to you guys that among us four, I'm still the best when it comes to girls. [scoffs] [Drake] Good night! [Drake whistling] [Drake wolf-whistling] What are you doing here? Whoa! Aren't you going to say hi to your new housemate first? What do you mean? I want to know your secret so bad that I'm going to be with you 24/7. [chuckles] Oh, okay. Skye, do we really have to talk about this? [Skye] Come on, just tell me. -Ah... -What? I knew it. Yes? Nothing! I was just checking if the door is locked. You know? So you'd be safe? [lock clicks] It is locked. Don't mind him. [Skye] All right, then. Go to sleep. Good night, my Pie! Good morning, my Skye. -[Chloe] Thank you, Miss Gail. -Hey, stop! -[Chloe] I'll call you later. -Where's your wallet? You're treating us today, right? There! Great! -Go! -I want... -[Marcus] Hi, Chloe! -[Chloe] They're so handsome! -[Marcus] Can't I miss you? -[Chloe] Are you giving me this? -[Chloe] What's your order? -[Marcus] Winter melon. [Andre] Hurry. -[Chloe] What? Winter melon? -[Sophia chuckles] [Sophia] Yes, Matt. Of course, Matt! I miss and love you very much! [Sophia] I love you, I love you, I love you! Okay, Matt. Bye! Call you later. [Veronica] Come on! Didn't I tell you we would be cleaning the house today? -Let's clean the house! -[Andre] I don't want to, Mom! Drake and I will play basketball today! [Veronica] What are you talking about? Look at Drake! Is he playing basketball? He's cleaning too! Drake, can I ask a favor? Can you please help Sophia? Can you please throw out her garbage? And you? I won't stop until I get you to help us. Come on, baby. Help us clean. [Andre grumbles] Give me that so I can help you. No, I can do it. But didn't Auntie V say that-- She said you should throw out my garbage. So do it. Okay! I'm just trying to help. [scoffs] What a messy room. [paper rustles] Whoa! This looks like a dinosaur with a wide-open mouth! -[mimics roaring] -[chuckles] -Calm down. -Don't touch that! These are worn out. Why don't you replace them? [laughs] That hurts! [Drake grunts] You like it hard? [laughs] What? [exclaims softly] [chuckles] [gasps] -Nice shot. -Hey! So? Did you like it? Where are my shoes? Right there. I bought those for you. -[Sophia] Give me my shoes. -I'll leave you guys to it. What's your problem, Sophia? Hey! [Drake] Hey! Stop! -Hey! -You shouldn't have touched it! Hey! What are you doing? I was just trying to surprise you! -What's so bad about that? -I don't want new shoes! Give me back my shoes. Why are those shoes so important to you? Do they have sentimental value? Oh, I know! I bet those shoes were given to you by your ex-boyfriend! So that's why you're not giving me any attention! You can't get over him! Well, you know what? Sophia Taylor, get over it! Those shoes are old and worn out! Take these instead! They're new! [Sophia] I said I don't want a new pair! Sophia, what in the world is happening to you? You're overreacting. Those are just shoes! -What's the matter with you-- -Those aren't just shoes to me! [crying] Maybe you find it easy to just throw things away, but I don't. [sobs] Do you know who gave those shoes to me? Those were given to me by my mother... who is now dead. And that's my only remaining memory of her! And that's the only thing that keeps me going! So if you think this is funny, can you just stop? Can you please just give me back my shoes? Please. Get in. I don't have time for your stupid games. I said, get in. I'll take you to your shoes. [Drake sighs] Out. What are we doing here? Just get out. Hey! Where are you going? And where are my shoes? -[airplane flying overhead] -Just follow me! [Sophia] Drake, what's going on? -[Drake] You need this. -What? I saw it. You'll go crazy if you don't let that out. What are you talking about, Drake? Let out all your anger, your emotions! -Scream your anger out! -You know what? I have no time for this. -I'm going back! -I'm giving you time for this. Okay? Now go! Will you please stop with this foolishness? Let's go back! We're not leaving until you do as I say, okay? Just let it out! Let it go! -[plane roaring] -[yelling] I hate this damn life! I can't take it anymore! I give up! Like that. Scream your anger out! Go! Don't be afraid! Just go and shout! Let go, Sophia! I hate this damn life! I've so many problems! I give up! Go! -I hate this life! -What? That's it? -I hate you! -Go on! I'm sick and tired of all this! How tired are you? I'm very tired! Let go more! [screaming] [yelling] [Drake] I hate you! I wish you never cheated on Mom, Dad! I wish you didn't gamble away all our money, Daddy! You're hurting Mom, Driana, and me! I hate you! I wish Mom were still alive! [Drake] I wish I didn't have a secret to keep! [Sophia] I wish my brother and I were never apart! I wish our family never fell apart! I wish I was still happy! I hate you! I give up! I hate you! Mommy, I miss you so much! Mommy, there's not a day that I do not think about you! [sobs] And I wish you never had to leave me! And I wish we could still be together. I wish we could just be happy altogether as a family. And I wish I never have to feel so alone! And I wish I never had to leave home. [somber music playing] Me, too. [sobbing] [Drake] I always come here whenever I'm mad... or whenever I'm sad. Because here, I can say everything I want to say without anyone hearing me. Here, I can say everything... without... hurting anybody. Your dad? [somber music continues] The first time... that I learned that my father had another woman... was two years ago. I really thought he had stopped cheating on Mom. But the other day, I saw him... with a girl again. [chuckles] If Mommy and Driana find out about it... [scoffs] [chuckles] ...I won't be able to handle it. I can't bear to see them get hurt like that. What about you? Your mom? [sighs] Her death was sudden. Aneurysm. A little over a year ago. Our family has always had financial problems. And my dad had a gambling problem. And I will never forget that day. [sniffles] I woke up to Dad's scream... then I saw Mom. She was unresponsive even if Dad was trying hard to wake her. Then I heard my brother cry... I don't even remember how we got to the hospital that fast. But we made it. And then, Daddy had to leave me with Mommy... because he needed to find money. But then, Mommy had an attack. And then, another one. And then another one. And then another one. She had six attacks. And I was just holding her hand the whole time. And I didn't know what to do. But then Daddy came back... with nothing. He gambled our money away. Then Mommy died. I could never look at Daddy after that. And then, I told myself, "I will be strong. I can't entrust my life and my brother's life to him." That's why I left. And that's why I want to get my brother. He was the first to break your heart. It's sad when your heart gets broken. Because you know that it can never be undone. But you know what's more sad? You wouldn't get hurt if you didn't love the person who hurt you. We only get hurt by the people we love. And the people we trust. I wish we could all just do away with love. If we could, then we'd probably never get hurt. [chuckles] [both chuckle] [sighs] [somber music playing] [door opens] [door closes] [exhales heavily] [sniffles] Sorry. [tranquil music playing] I'm sorry for almost taking away a piece of your home. And I'm sorry your heart got broken. I'm sorry your heart got broken, too. [groans] Are you okay? [grunts] My head just hurts a little. Maybe I just need to sleep this off. [sighs deeply] -Miss! -[pharmacist] Healthy day, sir! Hi! What's the most effective headache medicine you have? TGP Paracetamol, sir. It's as effective as the name brands, but it only costs one peso each. -One box and a bottle of water. -Okay, sir. Thank you. [tranquil music playing] Sophia! Sophia. [groans] Hey. Take this. Come on. There. Trust me. Come on. There. Oops. [tranquil music playing] [tranquil music continues] -Hey! -You've got some nerve! How dare you? How dare you play with my feelings? -Okay, I'm sorry! -Are you that ruthless? -After everything that I've been through! -[coughing] I really, really hate you! -No! -Hey! Dude! What's wrong? Can't you see I'm playing here? Now I can't-- It's Sophia... she was killing me in my dream. -It's just a dream. -She knows about the bet! Huh? It was just a dream. But... but it felt real. Like it really happened. Oh, I see what's happening. You're feeling guilty, aren't you? So what's to become of our bet? Your 30-day deadline is almost up, and you haven't even won Sophia's heart yet. So what now? Do you concede defeat? I don't want to fool Sophia anymore. You win. Yes! [laughs] Finally! -You've fallen for her, haven't you? -Stop it. Just get out. [Andre laughs] That's okay. Sophia doesn't need to know about the bet, right? [Andre chuckles] [Matt crying] Why can't you be here? -Please come home! -Matt... -Please stop crying. -Please come back! Didn't I promise you that I'm going to go to you, then I'll bring you back here? I promise, Matt. Please stop crying. -No! I want to be with you! -Of course, Matt. I want to be with you also. Matt... We're going to be together soon. -I promise you. -Hi, Matt! Hi! It's Drake, your sister's friend. Are you okay? [Drake] Do you believe in magic? Excuse me. Excuse me. Fifty pesos. Watch closely, okay? You fold it once. Fold twice. Fold three times. And scratch. Scratch. Ooh. Ooh. -Again! Please? -See that? -So do you believe in magic now? -Yes! Can you also try to believe that you and your sister will see each other again soon? Can you? If only I could, I'd perform a magic trick to make her instantly appear beside you. But the problem is that I'm not an expert yet. But I will practice some more. I promise. -Promise? -Okay? And you know what? Your sister's a great magician too. Really? She can go on for days without sleeping. All she does is work. She's doing that so you can come here soon. Can you promise me that you'll wait until your sister saves up enough money? [Drake] All right? All right. All right. One more! -One more, okay? -[Matt] Yes! One hundred. I will return this... Oh, right. I'll show you something, dude. Whatever it is, I already have it.

In William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, Petruchio used a number of techniques in order to tame... Ms. Taylor! -Sophia! -[snores] [professor] How did Petruchio use his techniques to tame his beloved Katherine? Because Petruchio disguises his attempt to tame Katherine through love and affection, and even though it seems like they hate each other, they truly love one another. [applauding] [professor] I'm very impressed! You know your classic literature very well. I would ask you now, what other techniques did Petruchio use in order to tame Katherine?

Are you going to help me surprise Sophia? -Please? -Are you serious about her? Yes, I'm serious. I've never felt this way about a girl before.

I understand. Uh... actually... I really want to thank you. Your gift was more than I expected. You don't need to pay me for the song I wrote for you. I should really be the one paying you. Don't mention it. I'm all for you. [chuckles] Sophia. Tomorrow, there's this dance thing. I was just thinking if... it would be okay if... would you go, I mean... would you dance... no.

And I love Driana. Dad, I love our family. Okay? And now... I hate myself even more. Because I became just like you. I hurt the woman who loved me. Drake... I'm sorry for everything.
