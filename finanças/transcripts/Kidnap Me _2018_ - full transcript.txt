Oh my God, I'm so wet, I'm gonna soak through the chair! That's nice dear! Is this going to be like last weekend? Relax. I am relaxed. You're not gonna get left on your own again. I promise. I just think it wasn't much fun. Stop fretting. I'm not fretting. You're a constant fretter. You're fretting about fretting now aren't you? Maybe. Well don't. I think this is it. You can go home if you like. Right. So it's Jasmine and... Henry. and Henry's in... Finance. and Jasmine? Rides horses. I had to kiss a lot of arse to get invited here tonight. Hopefully I won't have to suck a load of... Hi! Come in. Let me take your coat. Darlings! Let me take a good look at you. Strong Aqualine nose. Soft jawline. Short eye to eyebrow distance. Yes. Plenty to work with here. Thank you? Do forgive Jasmine! She's a dedicated student of physiognomy. Right. Well, I hope I measure up. Shall we? Charlie, I've got you over there next to Henry. I expect you two have much to talk about. Excuse me. Benjamin, you and I can make a pair here. Lovely. So I'm dying to know. How did you two sweethearts meet? Mutual friends. Through work. Mutual work friends. How romantic. Hankie and I were high school sweethearts. I knew from the moment I saw him that he was the one for me. He was my first. You must try the organic poppy seed with the aged Wensleydale. It is absolutely divine I'm totally stuffed... Choo choo! We have a brought all the way from Saffron Walden by horse and cart. Costs a bloody riot but makes for a minuscule carbon footprint. Oh! Umm... Err... Little Boy's room? Yes, please. Up the stairs on the left. She's really something isn't she? Most definitely. Well! Excuse me? Oh, right. Of course! It's going well then? You reckon? Well, they seem like nice people. Don't they? Now for the main event! Not yet, Jazzy! But I want to show them my basket. The Order of Aphrodite welcomes you, Benjamin and Charlotte, to its West Surrey Chapter. Now, as is tradition... Ladies. Oh, a fine choice. I've got a special treat for you and your strong aquiline nose. I wonder what they'll do first? I don't know... Well why not, you booked it? Well, yes... No actually, don't tell me. I want it to be a surprise. You were right about surprises. Oh, come on. What did you book? I don't remember. Ooh, I like it. No, I really don't remember. I hope you booked spanking? Yes, did, definitely asked for that one. Electrics? Nothing over nine volts though. They have a strict health and safety policy. Good boy! Hot wax? Pretty sure that was in there. So you do remember? Cheeky boy. Well done! So, you've got a lunch with the Marron CEO... Can I have a black one please? Sure. Followed by three o'clock yoga with Barnes. Cocktails at 5.30 I had to shunt to 6 but we have VIP reservations until 8. The MLE veep's are in conference at 9AM Eastern so you can link in at 2PM remote And Miss Hing is in your office. Thank you. Yes? Can I watch you close? Closing's a little like fucking, honey. Everybody likes talking about it afterwards but very few like to be watched. So hey, I'm going to need you to take a look at the Clifton file. Something's gone wrong somewhere and these numbers aren't quite adding up for me on this one. Isn't that Barton's account? Yeah, but Barton's away on midterm training and you're my go-to guy, aren't you! I need this sorted by noon tomorrow. I wouldn't know where to start. That's not going to stop a resourceful little guy like you, is it? Noon tomorrow! Noon. Noonski! Well, how much... Good to have you on board Mary. So, you found the balls up yet? You see that's just it. The whole thing is a complete mess. Look, if I didn't think you could handle it, I wouldn't have entrusted it to you, would I? Would I? Wouldn't you? I appreciate all the work you do for me, I really do. It's not everybody who's got the gumption, or the determination, to stay late and put their whole personal life on hold, just to sort out somebody else's problem. That person could be you. I believe in you. Please tell me you didn't tick water sports. No. Oh thank God. I hate that. You're always so sticky afterwards. And it smells. Just as well I didn't book it then. Great. Did you actually say no, like explicitly? I didn't tick the box. If some fat fucker pisses on me tonight Ben... No one's going to piss on you, Honey! They better not! This isn't quite what I was expecting though. I think this must be what they called the authentic experience. I thought you said it was a luxury experience? I guess it's a genuine representation of, uh... Yeah, well, I'd still have expected some leather and chains and things. Maybe even a whip ... Maybe even a whip... They'll probably bring that stuff out as they go, you know, probably have to keep things tidy. Avoid breakages. This just arrived for you. Thank you. Off out? Yeah, it's my birthday. Happy birthday. Anywhere nice? We've got a table at Space. Congratulations. We might be able to squeeze on another if... Love to, but you know... Yeah, I mean, they get pretty booked up. Another time maybe? Ta-da! You've been shopping. I've been a very, very bad girl. I can see that. So what? So? So what? Did you get my text? Sorry. It's been a long day. Come on, it's trussed-up Thursday! What is it next week? Whip-me Wednesday? Let's see how you get on tonight, big boy. Can a big boy take a rain check? With me looking like this? I thought you liked it? I do, I just... Don't make me return it. I've got loyalty points pending. Okay. So, what do you want me to do exactly? Not that. Get the paddle. I'm all yours, baby. Are you buying a house? We're buying a house. Are we? Are we ready for that? Yeah, it's working, isn't it? It's a big commitment. We're not getting married. Now hit me. Can we even afford it? Of course we can. I've just done the deal of the decade. And you've got the savings. Yeah. I just, I just don't think that buying is a good idea at the moment. I can't deal with renting anymore. It's throwing money away. I understand that. I do. I only wonder if... I'm just asking that we look. There's no obligation. I heard that they're putting up stamp duty, and then there's movers' fees and solicitors' fees and... We'd have to change the broadband. If I moved would you come with me? Yeah. Problem solved. Now hit me, bitch! Are you sure you said no water sports? I'm positive. Only it does kind of smell of piss in here. It's all part of the experience. Fine, but if I'm going to bent over and given a spanking I don't really want to be reminded of my grandmother. Taking their time though aren't they? Ben! I know. I just... You forgot the one thing I asked you to bring. We could... What, just us? It's not really the point though, is it? Excuse me. Yes? Are you two up for a fuck or what? It's just that me stiffy's gone and me nuts are getting cold! Sorry mate. Fucking hipsterites! Child locks. Why do you have child locks? They came with the car! Well, that was really embarrassing. We'll never be able to come here again. Not that I even came in the first place. Oh, I'm sorry are we going to get blackballed by the dogging society? At least I get some sort of balling. Come on. Let's go. What's wrong with my Malcolm then, eh? You can't just come here and mess around. There are rules, you know! Excuse me? You come here with your fancy cars and your sex pills, shoving your pert little boobs out and then... nothing! Malcolm's lost his hard-on! I'll make sure I can return it if I find it. I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding. I know your sort! My sort?! Honey, I think... Firstly, you don't stand there with your stretch marks and your condescension and expect me to explain myself. Secondly, Malcolm lost his own hard-on, and don't blame me if this is the only way you two can fuck anymore! Rude! Here - ribbed, for your pleasure. How unsavoury! Drive. It's a role play. What? Well, we're kidnap victims. Act scared. I'm too turned on to be scared. Help! What are you doing? Help us! We've been kidnapped! Don't scream the fucking house down, we don't want to be rescued. I'm just getting into character. Getting into character. Fuck sake! You're putting me off, is what you're doing. Putting you off what? I'm trying to frig myself off. But I've got no friction. Can you reach back? I'm tied up. Well, can't you reach with your fingers? How long do you think my fingers are? Apparently not long enough. Look, they'll be here soon enough alright? You'll have to have plenty of time to frig later. Fuck it. Help! That's the spirit! Help us! Help us! So, hey, I'm going to need you to look at the Clifton file again. Barton's back now. Well, I'm asking you to look at it. Why? Okay, let's just break this down. What's your job description again? Associate New Business Enterprise Executive. What's my job description? New Business Enterprise Manager. Correct! So that makes me... The boss. Well done! That, as you say, makes me the boss. The Big Kahuna! Number One! Numero Uno! The Big Cheese! Hang on a minute. This was Barton's mistake. It's Barton's account. It's Barton's problem. Well I'm giving it to you. Look, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but give it to fucking Barton! Red Leather Days. So what's this surprise then? You can't bear to see me in control, can you? Okay, where is it? Where's what? When you recommended the cheesecake? I thought... You thought? I'll be right back. Just tell me. You have to be patient. I've never been patient. In fact, if you remember I asked you out. I was building up to it. Oh? When? When were you going to sweep me off my feet? Well you didn't exactly give me much of a chance, did you? You had a week. I made the first move. Drunkenly caterwauling 'Wonderwall' at the company karaoke does not constitute making a first move, Ben. Madame, Bon anniversaire! Ooh, thank you! Well, I'm guessing it's not diamonds! Luxury abduction experience. Get ready One night of electrifying passion and role play. Get ready for a night you will never forget as our seasoned kidnappers whisk you off the street and take you to their secret lair. When? Keep reading. Tonight? Come here. That was the plan. Cheers. This is the kind of place we should be living. Yeah, right, how many millions do we need to do that? Daddy will be very cross if he sees me out with a boy tonight. I have to ride my pony tomorrow. But um, you said that daddy was out tonight so he's not going to catch us is he? I can't let you come in the maid'll tell mummy! Help us! Help us, we've been kidnapped! We've been kidnapped! Help! Finally! What took you so long? Honey, play the role. Sorry! Oh no, you big nasty, scary man! Please don't hurt me! We'll give you anything you want! Don't hit me please! And don't twist my nipples. I wasne gonna We'll give you anything. Just the fuck up. Do you know why you're here? Yes. I mean, no. Why are we here? What do you want? Are you going to spank me? No! I thought you said you booked spanking. Honey, not in front of the kidnapper please! You sure you're not going to spank her? This is not some fucking game, Posh Boy. Oh yeah, that's better. Get your shit together. Okay, sure. Sorry! Fuck, we've got a right pair of tossers tonight. Yeah? Posh twats. Jeez, posh twats, that's all we fucking need! They're fucking wankers, the lot of them, I tell ya! I swear I'm getting too old for this shit. Them two, they're on that coke, fucked in the head. Hope you're not texting. I'm not. Just put it on silent. It is. What did you think? He's not very convincing is he? Acting is harder than it looks, honey. What, is he out there touching his makeup or something? He's probably doing voice warm-ups. I could do with some warming up. What are we waiting for, eh? You know the score. We just let them stew for a bit, work themselves, up, then we take the ransom shot. Stew? We're not cooking a fucking meal! When do we get to cut off a toe? No, for real. Jake's brother chops off toes. The little one. It's his calling card. Well you see, calling cards are for morons. And Jake's brother's doing time, 'cos he's a fuckin' idiot! D'ya want to leave something for the polis to follow? I think not! Still though, I reckon we should be in there getting fucking medieval on the pair of them, pulling fingernails... See, that's why I'm in charge! Do you want to see how I do it? Does the Pope wipe his arse with a Rabbit? What? Does the Pope wipe his fucking arse with a... All right, all right! Follow my lead, watch and learn. Okay? Turn that phone off. Off! Right you two. Ears shut, mouths open! Jesus would you check the legs on that! Don't you fucking look at me. Ooh. Scary. You want your wifey to get hurt? No, but I think she does. Cool. Ow! Sorry, um, no way motherfucker. You ain't getting nothing out of me. Please don't do the American accent. Ooh, nasty! What else you got? This is fucking awesome! Try twisting. Shut it! We know who you are. We know who your daddy is. We know he's got cheddar. My daddy or her daddy? Hers! Oh good, good. Sorry. Just so we're on the same page. Carry on. Thank you, now where was I? Daddy. Your daddy's rich, now I'm the daddy. You're the daddy. What? He's the daddy. Oi! She spoke! Now , you're going to do what I say, when I say it. Alright? I'll do whatever you tell me. Daddy. This is no joke, lassie! If you don't do as I say, then your man here's in trouble! Really!?
