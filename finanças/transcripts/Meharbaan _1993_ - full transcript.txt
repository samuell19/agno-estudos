Brother Gopal. Our head Mr. Ravi has changed the entire picture of our village. Yes, brother. He learnt engineering in the city... ...and used it for the development of our village. He has set up canal and water pumps. He provided electricity in every household. God bless him! Yes, brother. Because of Mr. Ravi's efforts school and hospital... ...were established in the village. Mr. Ravi loves villagers like his own relatives. Brother, he has never made his mother realize... ...that she's not his real mother. - He respects her so much. - Yes. Certainly. Bless you, child! - Mother. - Hmm. Are you taking these eatables to Mr. Chaurangi Lal's house again? Yes, son. It's our duty to help him. Remember, before dying your father had said... ...that Mr. Chaurangi Lal is his friend. Help him in all his tough times. And then, he's going to become our relative in the future. I like his daughter, Neha very much. Mother, you're not helping him by feeding him daily. But you're making him lazybones. Mr. Chaurangi Lal gambles all the time and eats for free. And his son Vikram. He only knows bumming around and stealing. Hail Goddess! Scoundrel! Thief! Sinner! Are you stealing offering made to god? Leave it. - I'll not leave it, mother. - I told you to leave it. - Leave my hand. - Wait, Vikram. Give me this safe. Listen to me. I'm warning you for the last time to let go of this safe. Or else I'll pull your hand along with it. Rogue! Will you pull out your mother's hands that raised you? Pull out your hand that steals. Isn't hard-earned money enough for you? No! I used to get a very meagre salary. You got a job for me in the sugarcane factory. But there they asked me to work as a porter. Now have I stooped so low to work as a porter? Really? So what will you do? Will you become an officer or manager of the company? Have you completed your education? Illiterate ignorant! You don't have any skill. I'm telling you for the last time to return and work in the factory. Or I'll beat you black and blue. Get lost. Ace! King! Queen! With your blessings I can make the whole world my slave. [CHANTING] [CHANTING] [CHANTING] On no! Is this the way to iron? If I go out wearing such shirt... ...people will consider this king to be a slave. Where is my stupid wife? Janki! Hey, Janki! What's it? Why are you shouting? You've spoiled my mood early in the morning. Do you've any sense or shame? I'm your husband. And a husband is like a king. You've always dominated me as a husband. But did you ever earn anything for this house? Stop nonsense! Why didn't you iron this shirt? It's already ironed. Is it ironed? I want stiff ironing. - Really? - Yes. For that you've to starch clothes in rice water. There is no rice in the home for us to eat. How can I starch your clothes? There is no rice to eat? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why didn't that old hag Shanti, bring the eatables for us? I've brought it. Shameless! Lazy brat! I've brought it. Greetings, sister-in-law! God bless you! May god always keep us under your shelter! So that you can eat for free till you die. [LAUGHING] Why are you laughing like a shameless man? Your daughter has grown up now. You're not bothered about her. You're always engrossed in dressing up yourself. Child, I've brought some vegetables for you. Keep them. Why are you standing here? Keep it inside. - Go. - Yes. - Keep some money. - Yes. No, sister-in-law. You've been paying the expense of this house for many years. You've shouldered all the responsibilities. How long will you and your son take care of our livelihood? Why are you talking like a loser? They will do it till they're alive. Yes. They will provide us and you'll eat without any shame. - Do I eat from your father's money? - Enough! Don't be so arrogant! - You don't eat from her father's money but from mine, right? - Yes. The day you'll earn your livelihood, - you can talk arrogantly. - Yes. Go and find a job. Why do I've to look for a job daily? Do people work daily? You should rest in between and play cards too. - Will you play cards with me? - Get out! Go and beg. Mother! What's it? Are you competing with me? You're simply mooing. You're eating your food, but thwarting me from getting food. Sit quietly. Mother! Why do you always come here to beg in the morning? Can't you go somewhere else to beg? Useless. Fatso. Fatso! What's this, mother? Your cursing is fresh but rice is stale. Even rats don't eat such rice and you're giving it to me. Get lost. You're not a king, but a beggar. So what? Both kings and beggars are important for rule this world. If the king collects tax, the beggar takes alms. The king rules in his palace and beggar pleads in your courtyard. The king gives justice and the beggar gulps stale food. If I come to your door to beg... ...you don't do any favour on me, but it's vice-versa. Get it? - So don't come to my house again. - I won't. Are you bullying me because you're a cop's wife? The wife of an uniformed beggar. - What? - Then what? Do you think only you give me alms in this village? There are many people waiting in queue like beggars to give alms. And they call out, 'Bhiku beggar! Sir, come and take alms.' Get it? Go. God bless you! There is no scope for her. Mother! Beggar child of a singer! Yes, sir. Come here. - I'm here, sir. - Sit down. Thank you. Why did you get shocked? Are you jealous of my beauty? - You scum! - What? You're sitting next to me! Do you know the of difference between our status? - Yes, I know. - So? I've to go to various houses to beg for alms. But you get alms by sitting at home. - What? - No. I don't say that. - So? Everybody says that. These days even the kids are taught the same thing in the school. - I'll kick you. - No. My clothes will get spoiled. I've worn it last month. Sit down like a beggar. You buffalo! - Someone has said it right. - What? That life is like a beam balance. Those who are full of virtuous go down and those who are lowly go up. Stop your nonsense! Show your money. How much did you earn? I earn more than you. One day I'll hit you so much that... ...you'll forget how to call 'mother and father.' What will I forget? 'Mother! Father!' - You'll forget it. - The food isn't prepared yet. Come later. No, mother! I'm not begging. He's practicing begging. Sir, your voice is very nice. C'mon, let's beg together from tomorrow. - Shut up! Don't beg. What do I've to do? Stupid jenny! - Master. - What's it? Look there. Get side! She looks like a heroine of some film. Is there film shooting in our village? I don't know. - Since childhood I had a desire. - What? - To become a hero of a film. - You? Master, how will our pair look? She and you! Like a pair of swan and crow. - I'm not talking about you, but myself. - Shut up! - Father! - She's calling you. Don't grin. She's calling you, not me. Father! Who are you? I'm your only loving daughter, Neha. What's it, father? Neha! You! You've changed so much in the city. - Where is mother? - Inside. Go. She's in the kitchen. I weaved many dreams in a flash. Everything has been ruined. Monkey. How do I look in this getup? - I can't see you? - Why? It seems darkness has put on the goggles. Get lost! Mother! Daughter! You're here! Daughter! What are you looking at? Nothing. How are you, daughter? I'll tell that later. First tell me why no one came to pick me up at the station? Who would've come? I can't go alone. I had told your father. But he has not time for this house. Yes. You've started criticizing me. You keep maligning me in the village. Our daughter has come today and... ...you've started complaining in front of her. - Mother isn't complaining. - So? I'm complaining to you for not coming to receive me. You're a king's daughter. What is the need to come to the station to pick you up? On the contrary you should've brought... ...the railway train till your house. O my god! You? When did you come? When you saw me! The same old silly tactics. You've not learned to answer any question properly. If you talk clearly with wise men, there is no fun in it. Ok. You've won and I've lost. How are you? I was fine little while ago. But as soon as I saw you, a storm has raised in my heart. To ask you a question is like... ...putting your hand in the honeycomb of the honeybees. - Now get aside. - Please wait. What's the rush? Do you like the henna on my hands? Very nice. Get aside now. Please wait! Look here. It has slipped down. Please fix it. As you're growing older... ...your clothes are growing smaller. Move. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Give us the money or else I'll kill you. I don't care. You can even kill me... ...but I'll not give you the money. - I'll stab you. If you'll stab me, I'll scream. If you keep screaming, I'll keep on stabbing. If you'll keep on stabbing, I'll bite you. They both are getting whacked nicely. You too go and get hit. Please forgive me. Why were they hitting you? Any enmity? No. Actually I went to the market in the morning. I completed my task. I hid my money under my clothes. And I was on my way. When I reached the temple, someone hit me from behind. And he pointed a sharp knife and said... Give me all your money or else I'll stab you. Then I realized that they were thieves... ...and they wanted to steal my money. How much money do you have? 9 rupees and 75 paisa. What? 9 rupees and 75 paisa? Yes. Why? You're a very strange. For such a small amount you endangered your life. Is this money more precious than your life? Money! Because the soul in this body is mine... ...but the money belongs to someone else. Yes, sir. My neighbour Kishen gave me his chicken to sell in the market. If they had stolen my money... ...I would've lost my respect in front of Kishen. Shankar can give up his life but not his respect. Where are you from? Dhampur. You? Gangapur. - Gangapur? - Yes. I've heard village head of Gangapur, Mr. Ravi is very nice man. Do you know him? That's me. What? - Really? - Yes. O my god! I always heard that sooner or later god fulfils everyone's desires. Today I've witnessed that. I was very keen to see you. Today I've met you. C'mon. I'll drop you on the bike. Stop near that banana tree. - Please come to my home. - Not today. I'm late. - I'll come later. - Do come. - Sure. - Promise? - Promise. - I'll leave now. - Okay. If you want to buy or sell good animals in the market, call me. By staying among humans I can recognize animals very well. [LAUGHING] In that case get me a good cow that gives sufficient milk. Fine. Come after 2 days. I'll find such a cow for you. - Sir, bye! - Bye! Mother! My result has been declared. I've passed in the first division. My daughter! God has answered all my prayers. Now I'll distribute sweets in the entire village. [LAUGHING] What's it, sister-in-law? What is the happy occasion? Father, I've passed in the first division. Really? Show it to me. Wow! [LAUGHING] After all, whose daughter is she? When you were not even born... I had imparted all my wisdom in your brain. Maybe that's why your wisdom has been vanished. You've started again. Do your work properly. Or I'll chop you off. She always insults me. Fine. Listen to me first then fight. Mother, I want to join teacher's training course. Why are you asking me? - Ask Ravi. - Ravi! He has borne all the expenses of your studies till now. There is no need to ask Ravi. My orders are obeyed at home. Not his. I've not taught you so much to become a teacher. Now learn to take care of the house. Now you'll become my daughter-in-law. Wow, sister-in-law! You've spoken my mind. I bless you. Live for another 2-4 months! May you be ruined! 2-4 months? I'll live for another 200 years. And I'll live to see my daughter-in-law's grandchildren. Got it? I'll get you engaged to Ravi this month. "My heart has uttered your name slyly and softly." "Even this pleasant evening is blushing." "My heart has uttered your name slyly and softly." "Even this pleasant evening is blushing." "I tried hard to hide it." "But this love couldn't be hidden." "Now I don't fear the consequences, dear!" "My heart has uttered your name slyly and softly." "Even this pleasant evening is blushing." "I tried hard to hide it." "But this love couldn't be hidden." "Now I don't fear the consequences, dear!" "My heart has uttered your name slyly and softly." "Even this pleasant evening is blushing." "O beautiful, I've come!" "O beautiful, I've come!" "Wherever you'll keep your feet, I'll welcome you." "I'll shower all the love on you that is there in this world." "Wherever you'll keep your feet, I'll welcome you." "I'll shower all the love on you that is there in this world." "You've come as love." "You've come like a solace for my heart." "Then what do we got to do with the world, dear?" "My heart has uttered your name slyly and softly." "Even this pleasant evening is blushing." "O sweetheart! O lover!" "O beloved! O darling!" "I've weaved many colourful dreams." "I desire to rest on the bed of roses." "I've weaved many colourful dreams." "I desire to rest on the bed of roses." "What is this restlessness in our heart?" "We've gone crazy." "I've got the message of your loyalty, dear!" "My heart has uttered your name slyly and softly." "Even this pleasant evening is blushing." "My heart has uttered your name slyly and softly." "Even this pleasant evening is blushing." "I tried hard to hide it." "But this love couldn't be hidden." "Now I don't fear the consequences, dear!" "My heart has uttered your name slyly and softly." "Even this pleasant evening is blushing." I won't open the door. You went at dawn and are returning at dusk. You don't care for me at all. You've got that village head of Gangapur now, right? I don't care even if he's rich. - Does he have golden horns on his head? - No. Do diamonds grow in his farm instead of crops? Why do you care for him so much? Listen. I'm not your father. Whom do you want to meet? I want to meet Mr. Shankar. He had called me today. Fine. Come in. Thank you. Sit. Father will come soon. Forgive me. I didn't recognise you. I'm village head of Gangapur, Mr. Ravi Kumar. - What? - Yes. I'll send somebody to call father now. Gangva! Come here. - What's it, sister? - Go to the place of that moustache uncle. My father will be there. Tell him to come soon as... ...village head of Gangapur has come. Ok? What will you tell him? The Ganga from Dhampur has come. Come soon. The village head of Gangapur! Take this. Forgive me. I've said many wrong things about you. No. You said the right things. There was only one small mistake. Village-head, my foot! Does he have a horn on his head? Look, is there a horn? Sir, you! Why are you sitting on the floor? Sit on chair. I'm ordinary man. I'm fine here. Mr. Shankar, you're embarrassing me. Don't be embarrassed by the fact! When did you come? - A while ago. I swear, I'm very happy as a great person like you has come... ...to the humble abode of an ordinary man like me. I've finalised the deal of that cow for 1,000 rupees. You too check it. It's enough as you've seen it. Take this. And this. - What is this? - Commission. - Get up. - What? Get up. Lord Kishen, tell him... ...did you ever hurt your devotee by talking like that? Just tell him. He's my friend. And he wants to give me commission. I'll not talk to you. Ok. Please forgive me. I won't repeat such a mistake. Look here. I've kept the money back and apologize to you. - I'll leave now. -You can't. You've come to my house for the first time. - No. I'll not eat. - If you'll not eat... ...it will be the biggest insult of our friendship. Enough! - Father. - What happened? What's it? Father, why did you invite him to eat? He's my friend after all. - But there is nothing at home to eat. - Nothing? - Only rice water is there. - Rice water? But I've invited him to eat. - But... - Mr. Shankar. Yes, sir. I forgot to tell you that I've kept a fast today. - Fast! - Yes. Yes. I've kept the fast for lord Shankar. I'll come some other time. I'll eat food later. Ok. But you can at least have rice water, right? - Bring it, daughter. - No. - We can drink it during fast. Bring it, daughter. - No. - Take this, father. - Don't give it to me. Give it to sir. Sir. Wow! I've enjoyed it. I've never tasted such sauce before. While eating it, a person can even nibble his fingers by mistake. The mixture of coconut, chilly and coriander is splendid. But I've used only chillies and salt. Oh! Then maybe this is the magic of your fingers. She cooks delicious food. Sir, if you don't mind can I say something? Yes. If there is a good hard working boy in your neighbourhood... ...let me know. If I get Chanda married, I'll be free from my responsibilities. A good proposal had come from Rampur for her. But I don't know why she refused? - Father, I won't go far leaving you alone. - Did you hear? - She'll not go to other village leaving me. - Yes. Others have many relatives. But who does my father has? Only me. If I go, can you live even a single day? You... She's right. If she goes away, who will take care of you? Don't worry. Now it's my responsibility to get Chanda married. - Bye! - Bye! Come. Master, your feet move while walking. Stay far. How far? You're stinking. - Greetings, sir! - Greetings! - Come here. - Yes, sir. Come closer. Don't you know who I am? You're the would-be father-in-law of village head? And you're roaming wearing a turban in front of me. Aren't you ashamed? Take off your turban and tie around your waist! Get lost! Greetings, sir. Rascal! - Have you become arrogant now? - No, sir. You're insulting such a big person. Stupid fellow! Don't you know that I'm the would-be father-in-law... - ...of the village head, Mr. Ravi? - Yes. How dare you remove the turban from your head and... ...tie it around your waist in front of me? Because you hit Kalu and told him to do so. But till I don't slap, order and abuse you... ...turban should be on your head. Tie your turban. Tie it even at night or I'll chop behead you. Go. - But the turban was... - You animal! Yes, elder brother! For whom are you holding this umbrella? - For myself. - Really? - Yes. - Did I give you umbrella as alms? - No, sir. The person gets things in alms can't offer to others. Started speaking rubbish again! No. Don't hit me. This is against your pride. Who are you? You're a king. You're a big man! I'm your assistance. So stop fighting now. It is my work to hit now. Now even if you want to be hit, I'll hit you. Now watch my magic. Follow me. - Greetings, sir. - Halt! You fatso lowly man! You bastard! What have you considered him to be? Is he some idiot, imbecile, hooligan, dog or ass? You're abusing me! - I am not. - Then? - I'm praising you. I'm reminding him... ...that you are the would-be father-in-law of the village head. And he has tied his clothes below his waist in front of you. You bastard! Remove it. - No. Let it be. - Wait, your highness. Oh no! May you be ruined! Look, what all he's showing to me. - Come close and show it. - No! And remember one thing. - Oh no! - Visit him daily in this state till you're alive. In the morning. Afternoon. Evening. Night. Salute him for one hour. - Happy, sir. - You bastard! Wait, rascal! You beggar! Wait, rascal! C'mon, distribute it. - This is our 5 rupees. - Sir. - Yes. - Your dumb prey is coming. - Dumb? Yes. The same dumb Uma. Stupid! [LAUGHING] You can't escape now. Don't spare her! My queen. Now you can't escape. Forget that. Did you complete the task I gave you? - Yes. - Mr. Gupta. - Yes. - Have you spoken to engineer Mr. Tiwari for the temple? - Yes. And the work of the lake? - It'll start tomorrow. - Very good! Village head. We've been ruined. We've been disgraced. We're dishonoured. - What happened? - My dumb daughter has been raped, sir. Who has done this sin? Mr. Chaurangi Lal's son, Vikram. Come, Mr. Ravi. Have a sip with us. [LAUGHING] Father! Father, save me! Leave me! - Why are you hitting my son? Ravi! Leave him! - Save me! Mother! Save me! Ravi, leave him. - Mother! - Vikram leave him! This isn't the matter of our house, but of the entire village. Get lost! I'm going today, Mr. Ravi. But the day I'll return from the jail... I'll make your life miserable. Wow! After all, whose son is he? Take him away. C'mon. Ravi, what have you done? He is my only son, apple of my eye!. And you've sent him to the jail. You've dumped the support of my old age in the jail. You're worried about the support of your old age, right? And can't you see the pain of these old parents? Their daughter's life has been ruined. It's hard to get a groom for a dumb girl. And now she has been raped. Who will marry her now? Sir, I'll marry Uma. I'll regain her respect. - Rakesh. - Yes, sir. And I promise I'll never taunt her throughout her life. Because it's not her fault. - Greetings, Mr. Ravi! - Mr. Juman, how come you're here? I had come to ask you how much more money... ...do you want as advance for the crop of sugarcane? For the crop of sugarcane? - But I never spoke to you about it. - What are you saying, Mr. Ravi? You finalized the deal to sell the sugarcane crop to me. I even gave advance of 10,000 rupees. - 10,000 advance? - Yes. - Whom had you given it? To your would-be father-in-law, Mr. Chaurangi Lal. - To Mr. Chaurangi Lal. - Yes. He even sent this receipt which has your signature. Get aside. First talk about work. I'm here for that only. My beautiful queen! When you don't meet me I sleep and dream about you whole night. Listen to me. Meet me daily near this well. We'll play cards and other games together. Get aside. You always come with your dirty intentions. What has happened about my work? Your work? - My work? - Yes. Didn't you promise to give me 5 acres of land... ...along with water pump? Where is all that? Water pump. The pump is ready. I'm looking for the land. As soon as I get the land, I'll fix the pump. Why do you get angry? I've brought velvet sari and sweets for you from the city. Wear it fast in front of me. Then we'll eat sweets together. - I don't want this sari. - Please, wear it. - Village head! - Oh god! He hasn't come. I've come. May you be ruined! I almost lost my life! Not yet. The process has just started. - Why are you here? - I've brought the fuel for the devil's car. - Say clearly that you've brought booze. - It is the same thing! - Will you've some booze? - I don't drink. I'm getting late. At least eat sweets. - I'll leave now. - At least wear the sari. Shall I wear it? Why did you come so early? - So early? - Yes. - I've come after 3 hours. An Indian movie gets over in 3 hours along with interval. - Is your movie very long or is there dirt in the reel? - You! Hold your leg. And if possible hold your other leg too. - Why? Your destruction is coming. - From where? - Look there. - O my god! - I'll leave now. - Where? - To beg for your coffin. You bloody beggar! - Greetings! - What are you doing? I'm working in yours farm since morning. Forget food, I didn't even drink tea. By the way, this farm doesn't belong to me, but Mr. Shambhunath. Yes. And the second thing. Those who swindle illegal money don't feel hunger for food. Yes. You're absolutely right. What do you mean? Someone took 10,000 rupees from Mr. Juman Sheikh... ...by forging my signature on fake receipt. 10000? Fake receipt? Just show it to me. This is definitely a fake receipt. But who has done this fraud? Who is it? Look, before I get angry tell me who the culprit is. So that I can punish the person, who has conned my son-in-law... ...in front of the entire community by hitting him with shoes. Am I right? Answer me. - Take this shoe. - Whom do I hit? Stand in front of everyone and hit yourself. - What do you mean? - Don't try to act over smart now. Confess your crime. Or else I'll hand you over to the police. They'll torture you to reveal the truth. Police? What's the need to call the police? This is between father-in-law and a son-in-law. I made that fake receipt. And I took those 10,000 rupees. - Where is that money? - They've been spent. - They've been spent? - Yes. Your son and you have maligned me in front of all the villagers. Before dying my father had made me promise... ...to help you and your during problems... ...because you were his friend. And I've been fulfilling that promise for many years. But it is enough now. It is a sin to act humanely with blood sucking parasites. And it is a virtue to treat them like animals. Master... ...what are you doing? Strange sounds are coming from within you? My heart is burning with fire of revenge. - Is there a fire within? - Yes. - Really? That Ravi is very proud of himself. But if I'll not shatter his pride, I'll change my name. He hasn't recognized me properly. I'll completely shatter that Ravi's pride, Bhiku. Yes. I'm waiting for that day... ...when he'll get married to my daughter. The day he marries Neha... I'll cling to his wealth like a parasite and... ...make him bankrupt. -Father. - Yes. The village head of Gangapur is coming. Village head? God! Has that cow fallen sick? - Sir. - Greetings, Mr. Shankar. Sir, how come you're here? - Wait. Is everything fine? - Yes. Is that cow creating any problem? No. I've not come regarding the cow. So? You had told me to find a suitable groom for your girl. Yes. I've found that boy. Why are you standing outside? Please come inside. Nobody is outside. He isn't outside. So? That boy... ...is in front of you. - In front... - You? - Yes. What are you saying, sir? Yes, Mr. Shankar. If you don't have any problem... I want to marry your daughter. Sir, it's true that when the sunrays fall on the moon... ...it becomes bright and gives light to the world. But you're giving undue importance to my Chanda... No, sir. There is no match between Chanda and you. Mr. Shankar, I'm proposing to get married to your daughter... ...not by seeing your position but by your decency. If you want some time to think about it, think properly and decide. I've to think whether this is a dream or a reality. That day you saved me from death and gave me new life. And today you're talking about marrying my daughter... ...and making her a daughter-in-law of such a big family. You're ready to make us your equal. You're not human but an incarnation of god for us. No. Don't think of me as a god's incarnation, but a devotee... ...who wants to stay under your shelter. Bless me. God bless you! You've given me your blessings. But ask your daughter for her consent. When a girl feels shy and leaves like this... ...consider that she has consented, sir. Sir, I'm going mad with happiness... May my darling girl live a happy life! She looks so cute! Only her marriage with Ravi is going to be fixed today. And she's feeling shy like a bride on her first night. - She is so happy. - Sister-in-law, her father is happier than her. My heart is getting excited and popping up. - Take care of it. - Really? If it falls on the ground, it will break into many pieces. Congratulations, village head. Greetings, Mr. Ravi. - Congratulations. - Son, you're home! Mother, what is all this? I'm getting you engaged with Neha today. - My engagement with Neha. - Yes. - But mother... - What? I'll tell you. But first, tell them to leave. - You may leave. - Wait! Nobody will leave. Mother, I want to talk to you in private. Please leave. - Shall we leave? - Let's go. Mother, I don't accept this relationship? What are you saying? Why can't you accept it? What is lacking in Neha? Mother, relationships depend on girl's family background. And I don't like this family. So I don't accept this relationship. Who are you to decide? You'll have to accept my decision. When Neha was born, I had taken her in my lap and promised Janki... ...that she's the daughter-in-law of my house now. And you want to disown my desires. I'll never let you do that. You've to get engaged with Neha right now. I'm helpless, mother. This can't happen. Why? Because I've already promised... ...to marry Mr. Shankar's daughter of Dhampur. Before promising him didn't you remember the promises... ...you made to your father on his deathbed? Mother, I remember all those promises. And to fulfill those promises, I've always helped them... ...since my childhood. But in spite of that, her father and brother acted shamelessly. Even though poor, if they had been a respectable... I would've agreed to get married in that family. But they've taken undue advantage of my service and my sympathy. They've done such pathetic deeds that, forget marriage... I don't even feel like being their enemy. And so you've promised to get married to that poor man's daughter. Mother, they maybe poor... ...but they've the wealth of respect and dignity. You only live with that wealth. If that girl comes in this house, I'll not stay here. Do you've so much hatred for your daughter-in-law? She's not my daughter-in-law. My daughter-in-law is Neha. I've just one daughter-in-law. If I don't get the daughter-in-law of my choice... I'll leave this house. Is this your final decision? My decision is the ultimate one. But you too remember that along with my desires... ...you've broken my heart. Even you'll never be happy. Remember my word. You'll never be happy. Mother! [CHANTING] [CHANTING] [CHANTING] Bless you! Be happy! May god bless you both! According to the customs and traditions of the society... ...the bride's side has to give dowry too. But I can't give you anything except my daughter. No father. You've given me your virtuous daughter. I don't want anything else. On this happy occasion please accept this small gift from me. No, son. Don't do this. Don't refuse, father. You'll hurt not your son-in-law sad, but your son. Yes. Now I'm not your son-in-law, but your son. "O beauty, just tell me this much." "Why do the bangles cling all night?" "O beauty, just tell me this much." "Why do the bangles cling all night?" "Why won't the bangles cling at night" "Why won't the bangles cling at night" "when her beloved will hold her hands?" "My naughty lover troubles me all night." "He doesn't leave my hands if he catches it." "If I'll sleep by making an excuse," "he gets hold of my hand and wrings my wrist." "O beauty, just tell me this much." "Why do the anklets rattle all night?" "Why won't it rattle," "Why won't it rattle," "when the beloved will caress her?" "My parents have married me to a selfish groom." "He only insists on his wish, but doesn't listen to me at all." "My beloved do whatever he wants." "He doesn't let me sleep all night." "O beauty, just tell me this much." "Why does the ring shines all night?" "The ring shines to tempt the lover." "The ring shines to tempt the lover." "Now you understand the rest yourself." "How do I tell you about love?" "You're a spinster. How do I explain it to you?" "May you get married soon!" "We bless you from the bottom of our heart." Where is it? I had kept it here. - Master, have you seen it? - What? Can't you see I'm eating? Stand afar. So I'm not going into your mouth? I'm looking for my plate. Have you seen it? - Plate! - Yes. I haven't seen your dirty and stinking begging plate! Very good! I had heard about robber getting robbed. But the first time a beggar is getting robbed. - Stop your nonsense! - I'm not. I'm talking sense. - First you hated even my shadow. - I still do. You never liked to be a beggar. I still don't want to be a beggar, beggar? Then why are you eating in a beggar's plate? - Is this your plate? - Yes. Empty your stomach too. That will be done. But why didn't you tell me earlier? I've ate your dirty food by mistake. Now what will happen if I'm afflicted by your begging trait? Your ruin. - What? - Look ahead. C'mon. Enough. Good! Beggar. Yes, my brother. Who is this old hag? I think he's that girl's father and Ravi's father-in-law. Ravi! Wait, son. Who is she, son? Aunt Janki. Come, child. God bless you two! Now place your right leg ahead and step in. Janki! You're my wife and you're blessing my enemies. Have you lost your mind or become shameless? They both are fine. I'm not shameless so I've blessed Ravi and his wife. - Blessings! - We are indebted by his favours. He even gave the stiff ironed shirt that you're wearing. Shame! - Nobody scolds even a beggar from doorstep like this. - Rogue. If anybody had scolded me like your wife did to you... I would've jumped in a well and committed suicide. - Shall I search for a well? - Stupid! Why do you always scratch my wounds? - Oh my god! - I'll not spare you! - If you had to return, why did you come here? - Madam... ...shall I bring mangoes from the garden? - Yes. Okay. Where is father? Do it correctly. Like this. Do like this. Father, this is a woman's work. Leave it. I've left it. Ok. I'm keeping protein powder in it. Take it daily with milk. This is drink is for sick people. I can't drink it. - No. You've to drink it. - Okay! Now stop roaming around the market in the hot sun... ...to get cattle for others. - If you fall sick, who will take care of you? - Fine. - And twice a week. - I'll come four times a week. Can I live without seeing you? Answer me. And Ravi isn't here yet. I've taken his name and he has come. You'll have a very long life! - Father is going back to the village. - Why? - I've to take care of the house and work. - Enough, father! You've done lots of work. Now it isn't your age to work. Now take rest. And forget about returning to your village. But listen to me. If you've any love or any respect for your son-in-law in your heart... ...you'll not think of leaving this house. Now it's your wish. What has he said? Explain to him. What do I explain? He's right. And now even I'll say that if you respect him, you won't leave. Now it's your wish. Now what can be my wish? I'll do as you say. You don't do any work properly. You useless! I'll kill you! Yes. Kill me. Instead of living thirsty and hungry, it's better to die. So that I'll get rid of you. Are you arguing with me? You bitch! You imbecile! Enough! You've started fighting early in the morning. - Mother, please be quiet. - She's arguing with me. I'll chop off your tongue and fed it to that beggar. I've seen unfortunate people's evil face early in the morning. My whole day is going to be ruined now. What are you looking at? Get lost! - Dhano. - Yes, sister. Why was fighting going on at their house? What to say? That sister's husband is very useless. He doesn't earn even a single penny. Your mother-in-law used to cater for their needs. But it has stopped after your arrival. Actually, their daughter Neha was supposed... ...to get married to our Mr. Ravi. But Mr. Ravi refused and married you. Because of this reason Mr. Ravi's mother left home in anger. And sister Janki stopped coming to this house. Aunt! Aunt! Daughter Chanda! Come inside. - Keep it here. - Ok. All this... Don't consider me to be an outsider, aunt. Consider me your own daughter from today. Please keep this. No, child. Ravi used to pay for the expenses of this house before your arrival. But it was a different thing at that time. The relationships were different at that time. But now it's not right for us to be a burden on you, child. Did all those relationship break after my arrival? Today if your daughter would've brought this for you... ...would you have said the same thing to her? Aunt... ...my mother passed away on my born. I've neither seen her face nor received her love. I want to present a small gift to you as I consider you my mother. Please accept it and do a favour on your daughter, mother. Do a favour. Neha! What have you done? You keep quiet, mother. Aren't you satisfied after ruining my life that... ...you've come to give these alms and insult us. Neha! Get lost. I'll get peace only when you die. Your cheap father and you have snatched my Ravi. Look, you can say anything to me, but don't insult my father. Or else I'll not be able to bear it. You'll not be able to bear it! Get lost! - Get lost. - Neha! Have you gone mad? - Come inside. - Get lost! - Come inside. - I said get lost! - Come inside. Mother, leave me. [CRYING] I apologise to you for her childishness and mistake. - Please forgive me. - No! A mother lifts her hand only to give blessings... ...not to ask for forgiveness. Don't insult my mother's hands, mother. Daughter! - Chanda! - What's it? Did Neha raise her hand on you? No! Who told you? Sister, I told him that... Dhano! Don't lie to me, Chanda. Swear upon me and say whether she raised her hand on you or not? Look, this matter is between the women. Men shouldn't interfere in it. I insist to know the truth. Look, she's immature. What's the big deal if she raised her hand in anger? How did she dare to raise her hand on my wife? - I'll teach her a lesson now. - Don't do that. - Get side, Chanda. - Listen to me. - If I had been in Neha's place, I would've done the same. - Chanda! Look, it is only 6 months since we got married. And I can't stay without you for a second. She has grown up with you since childhood. She always dreamt to make you her life partner. Her dreams were shattered suddenly. All her desires were ruined. In this condition, even a stone will crack down. She's just a human being. A weak girl. What would've gone through her heart? And the second thing is that... ...you used to cater the needs of their house. Today they don't have any support. The villagers might think that you severed... ...your relationship with them because of me. And the truth is that I'm responsible for their ruin. Neha's heart has broken because of me. What are you saying, Chanda? Will you listen to me? Now don't change the relationship that you shared... ...with them before our marriage. And one more thing. Bring your mother back from wherever she is now. Mother! Chanda, you don't know my mother. She'll make your life miserable. She'll criticise you day and night and make your life hell. She'll only criticise me, right? She'll not burn me up, right? If there will be truth in my love and behaviour... ...one day with my service... I'll make her helpless to give me her love and blessings. This is the real duty of an ideal wife. Wow! How did you start talking so wisely? I think that you're a complete dumb and insensible. You don't have any knowledge about house and family. Really? And if I become a mother in the next 6 months... ...will you still think the same about me? Absolutely... Mother! Are you pregnant? Why didn't you give me this good news before? Chanda! "If my hands could reach the sky," "I would've laid down stars at your feet." "If my hands could reach the sky," "I would've laid down stars at your feet." "We would've gone far away in fairyland" "and made a house of love there." "If my hands could reach the sky," "I would've laid down moonlight at your step." "We would've gone far away in fairyland" "and made a house of love there." "If my hands could reach the sky," "I would've laid down stars at your feet." "We'll scatter buds everywhere." "These lanes will be filled with aromas of flowers." "We'll scatter buds everywhere." "These lanes will be filled with aromas of flowers." "In these beautiful and pleasant world" "only the heart will express their feelings." "only the heart will express their feelings." "I would've made the rays protect our courtyard" "if my hands could reach the sky." "Only the clouds of loyalty would shower here." "They will drench us and make us mad." "Only the clouds of loyalty would shower over here." "They will drench us and make us mad." "We'll spread the blanket of spring here." "We'll spread the fragrance of love here." "We'll spread the fragrance of love here." "We would've made the birds of happiness fly here," "If my hands could reach the sky," "We would've gone far away in fairyland" "and made a house of love there." "if my hands could reach the sky." "I would've laid down moonlight at your step." "I would've laid down the stars at your feet." "I would've laid down moonlight at your step." "I would've laid down the stars at your feet." Madam, these bangles look so beautiful on your fair hands. Take your money. Dhano! Yes, madam. What's it? Listen. Go to the tailor. He had promised to give clothes today... ...but he has not brought it yet. - What will I wear for the festival? - Ok. I'm taking lunch for sir at the stone mines. I'll bring the clothes from the tailor while returning. No, Dhano. You'll not go to the mines. Today I'll take food for him. You? How will you go so far to the mines in this condition? With my legs. Today is our wedding anniversary. I'll feed him today. Mr. Ravi, I've placed the bomb on the mountain. - Good. Tell all the workers to come on this side. Go. Brothers, everybody come here. The bomb is going to blast now. - You too come. - Let's go. - Everybody has come. - Fine. Son Ravi, look there. Chanda is coming from that side of the mountain. And the bomb is going to blast there. Chanda, wait! Daughter, wait! The bomb is going to blast there. Daughter, wait! Wait, Chanda! - The bomb is going to blast now. - Chanda, wait! - Don't move ahead. - Wait there. Chanda, wait! - Mr. Ravi. - Chanda, wait! Wait. Chanda, run quickly! Wait! Wait! Chanda! - Chanda! - Chanda! Chanda! Chanda! Sir, what has happened? Get car quickly. - No! - We'll take her to the hospital. - Go. - No! - No! - Chanda! - Chanda! - My time is up. No, Chanda. This cannot happen. I have very less time. - Listen to me... - Chanda. Give me a promise. You will never separate my father from you. - Never. - His heart... - Chanda! His heart is like a kid. He... He will not be able to... He will not be able to bear the shock of my separation. Chanda! Chanda! Chanda! Please take care of him. Yes Chanda! Be with him anyway. Promise me. Promise me. - I promise you Chanda that... I will always be with him. Chanda! Chanda! Chanda! "If my hands could reach the sky..." "I would've laid down the stars at your feet." - Chanda, my daughter! My daughter! Sir, what has happened? Move! Enough! Well done! Son Ravi. 'My decision is the ultimate one.' 'But remember that you've broken my desire and heart.' 'Even you'll never be happy.' 'Remember my word.' 'You'll never be happy.' I cursed you that day unknowingly. I didn't know it'll come true. Please forgive me, son. Who can change the destiny, mother? Chanda had to leave me. She has gone. Son... ...forget the past. Assume that it was your dream. Now that you're awake that dream has ended. Now start a new life again, son. You'll not say anything now. I won't let you be stubborn now. You've to settle down again. And if you refuse, I'll leave you forever go on pilgrimage. Mother! What are you telling, sister-in-law? Chanda has departed from this world, but not from Ravi's heart. In this condition, shall I tell Ravi to marry my daughter? I can't be so shameless. Sister-in-law, you're right. This fool won't understand it. She doesn't know how to make pairs of cards. Then how will she make marriage pairs? She always fears god. If we'll do this, god will do that and vice-versa. Whatever god has to do, he doesn't do that. Then why will he waste his time in stupid things? You fool! Sister-in-law, please get my daughter married to Ravi at any cost. We're in a very pathetic condition. We're bankrupt. Look, how slim I've become! My clothes are loose. This shirt and sarong doesn't fit me anymore. It slips off while walking. But sister-in-law, you've become returned very fat. Which flour were you eating there? - Shut up! Look, your bangles have become so tight. Give it to me. I'll take it to the goldsmith to make it bigger. - Get lost! When I had left, you were very cunning. But now you've become even more cunning. Rogue! Zombie! Leave my bangle and think of... ...a way to get my son and your daughter married. I've planned everything for that. Uncle Gopal! How are you? Not good, brother. I'm thinking of committing suicide. - My son-in-law has thrown me out of his house. - Really? But why? He said, 'lazybones... ...'the father-in-law who stays in his son-in-law's house' 'is indeed very shameless and rogue.' Now I'm not like Mr. Ravi's father-in-law. God! Give such a foolish son-in-law to everyone! Pray to god for my welfare. - Take this. - 10 rupees. You had promised 50 rupees. You'll get half on making the move... ...and the rest when we win the game. The game has just started. Now leave. - Sister-in-law! - What's it? I think it's time now to play the last game of cards. - Call some learned priest. - For what? An evil man has entered your house. You can't win until he leaves this house. And there won't be any peace or happiness in your house. Arrange for his veneration and drive him out fast. Out. 2 evil people had entered this house. One of them has died. But the other one is still hovering around. Your son won't act sensibly till he's here. And my daughter won't get married. So I'm telling you to call some priest and... ...drive this inauspicious man out of this house. I think this evil man has understood us. I can sacrifice my life too for my son-in-law. If my departure can bring joy in Ravi's sorrow life... I'll leave. Goodbye! You! Wait! "Our life makes us face difficult stages." "It neither lets you laugh nor cry." "My destiny is angry with me." "I've been thrown out of my own house." "Our life makes us face difficult stages." "Our life makes us face difficult stages." 'There are 52 cards. There are five's, six's and seven's.' 'They all are my brothers.' 'Listen to me, dear.' What is going on? Nothing. I was stuck. Where is Chanda's picture? Sister-in-law, answer him. - Your father-in-law took it. - Yes. Really? But where? Where is father? He returned to his village. - Village? - Yes. I tried to stop him. But he said that... ...the person for whom I used to stay here, is no more now. Now I can't stay here. - What? - Yes. He said the same thing. And he picked up Chanda's picture and left. I'll investigate it right now. Wait, son! Now what's the use of going there? He came here for the person whom you had married. With her death your relationship with him has ended too. Yes. I'm right. Aren't we your relatives that you're worried for a stranger? - C'mon. Have food. Let him die! - Mother! If you'll say anything against him even by mistake... - I won't forgive you. - O lord! I think you must have misbehaved with him... ...so he left this house. If you are proved wrong, I won't spare you. O my god! Son Ravi, you? Father, tell me honestly what happened? What did they tell you? - No. Nobody said anything. Actually I came on my own. But why? And how did this photograph break? There is no guarantee of a human life. After all, this is only a photograph. Chanda's death had filled our lives with sorrows. In such state my presence will remind you of Chanda. And as per the traditions it's better for me to stay here. I don't believe in any traditions. You've forgotten that... Chanda gave your responsibility to me while dying. And I had promised her. From that day, I don't consider you my father-in-law, but father. Respect the feelings of a son, father. - I do. - No. You don't. If you had, you wouldn't have leave that place like that. I tied nuptial chain and married Chanda... ...to get a decent patron and... ...father like father-in-law. I don't have anybody except for you in this world, father. Everybody is very mean here. If you leave me, with whose support and why will I live this life? Don't say that, Ravi. If I'm alive only for you and your happiness. I'll be happy only if you come with me. I'll come with you, but I've one condition. I accept all your conditions. Let's go. Listen, first. My condition is that you will marry Neha soon. Father, what are you saying? By bringing joy in your life... ...sorrow and grief will automatically vanish, son. And then Neha is a good girl. She considers you her husband since childhood. I want you to marry Neha. - But father... - Look, if you respect for me even a little and... ...consider me your father, fix the wedding date immediately. I'll come with you the day you'll bring invitation card. For Chanda's sake. Master, I think... - ...that you're eating after many days. - What do you mean? I mean that when a person eats someone else's food... ...and eats half and spills half it means... ...that the person has lost his habit of eating. You take this. - Yes. - I'll beg another one and eat. Colourless! Colourless! Hold your tongue, old hag! My destiny has already ruined my life and make is colourless. And on top of that, you're calling me colourless. - My name is Chaurangi. - Yes. That same thing. Chaurangi or whatever? What's there in the name? Now dance joyfully. You're going to become my relative very soon. - I didn't get it. Ravi has agreed to marry Neha. Yes? Really! Yes! What happens if he has agreed? - This king has not yet agreed. - Are you against this marriage? Yes. I'm not a weak man. - Even I've some conditions. - Conditions? - Scum! What conditions? - I'll tell you. - First transfer Ravi's property in my name. - What? Yes. Only then will this marriage take place, or else I won't. Get lost! You don't deserve to get any property! Do you think this marriage won't take place if you disagree? Who are you? A rotten stray dog! I'll not even invite you for the wedding. You'll be standing afar like beggars and watch it. And the wedding celebrations will take place here. I'll make this wedding possible. Master, I accept your mouth isn't used to eating. But... ...has it lost the habit of speaking too? - What? - Then what? You're boasting very much. A crow should fly, but not as high as an airplane. Or else if it's wings are clipped in the sky... ...it'll fall down and die like a rat. What do you mean? - I mean agree with that old hag. If you disagree for this wedding, your condition will be like me. You beg for alms. You call out in the lanes like... "Mother!" "Mother!" "Mother!" "Mother!" Master! Started begging in your dreams? No. Sister-in-law! I agree to this marriage. Print the wedding cards fast. [LAUGHING] [CHANTING] Father! [CHANTING] Yes, son. This is the invitation card of my wedding. Bless you, son! Now I respect you even more. What's this? Why did you write my name on the invitee's place? Father, you're the elder of my family. That's why I gave your name. But son, won't your relatives feel bad after reading... ...the name of a small and poor man like me? Father, neither you're small nor poor. I'm getting married only to fulfil the promise I made to you. I'll be very happy if you come there. I don't care if nobody else comes there. I'm very lucky... ...to have a person like you as my son-in-law. You're not only my son-in-law but my son too. Be happy! [CHANTING] Be happy! [CHANTING] - Neha! - No, son. The world has unnecessarily made a custom... ...to seek elders' blessings after the wedding. Neha respects me a lot, but... ...she doesn't wants to show it in front of others. My blessings are with both of you. Janki, I'm very happy today. The biggest responsibility of Neha's wedding... ...has been fulfilled. Now I will enjoy myself throughout my life. "If they've lots of money," "they gulp down the entire keg of booze." "If they're penniless," "they just smell the booze." Wow, master! What a beautiful verse! Shut up! You're neither drinking nor serving drink. You're creating din for no reason, stupid! "Come, master!" "Let's start drinking booze." "Let's start drinking heavily today." "God knows if we'll get booze again or not." "Come, master. Let's start drinking booze." "Let's start drinking heavily today." "God knows if we'll get booze again or not." "My heart prays for a bar behind my house." "We should daily visit that place." "We should daily visit that place." "I'm thirsty for booze since 2 days." "Satiate my thirst and do a good deed." "Give us booze to drink." "Give us booze to drink." "If we'll drink a little," "we'll bless you." "May your kids live long!" "May they grow up and drink booze!" "God knows if we'll get booze again or not." "Let's start drinking booze." "Let's start drinking heavily today." "God knows if we'll get booze again or not." "When we'll die, mourn for us, friends." "Drink booze and give it to everybody else." "Drink booze and give it to everybody else." "Call the drunkards and tell them to bathe us with booze." "Cremate us in the bar." "Cremate us in the bar." "May our ashes" "always remain in the bar!" "We'll be born in wine-bearer's house again." "God knows if we'll get booze again or not." "Come, master. Let's start drinking booze." "Let's start drinking heavily today." "God knows if we'll get booze again or not." What are you doing? Stop! For god's sake, wait! I beg of you. Wait! What is going on? - Look, sister-in-law - What are you doing? I don't know who they are? They entered our house suddenly and... ...started throwing the house items outside. They say now this house belongs to them, not us. Why? Who said that this house belongs to you? Why are you getting angry on us? Ask Chaurangi Lal. He has sold this house to our boss. - Really? - Yes. What's it, Chaurangi? Have you sold the house? Why are you sitting depressed? Tell me. I didn't have any other option, sister-in-law. I've was in a huge debt by bearing Janki's expenses... ...throughout my life, so creditors started harassing me. On top of that I had to get Neha married. From where will I bring the money? So I've sold the house. You've not spent even a penny on Neha's wedding. Ravi and sister-in-law has borne all the expenses. - What have you spent? - You want to know? If you'll read this list, you'll go mad. There are more expenses during wedding than the cards in my deck. Now that we've lost our house where will we take shelter? They've become homeless. Now where will they get shelter? Listen to me. Let them stay in our house. What will the villagers think if you don't support them now? I request you to call them to your house, son. - Now where will we go to find a shelter? - You won't go anywhere. You'll stay in our house now. - God has come here! - Come. 'They didn't get up after seeing me!' No. Be seated. They're already sitting. Who is standing? Shut up, beggar! When the poor don't get up after seeing a rich man... ...you've to say that. Beggar! - Greetings! - Salutations! - Greetings! - Greetings! You didn't stand on seeing me before. You are standing now. - Look. - Just turn around. Oh god! Son-in-law, you! I thought they're standing to welcome me with respect. Brothers... I've called you here to inform you that... ...now the responsibility of my entire business and property... ...will be in my father-in-law's hand. Ok. He'll take care of everything now. Father. No. What are you doing, son? I'm giving your responsibility to you. - Take care of it. - No, son. I'll take care of all those responsibilities. That is my duty. But I won't take care of these keys. Look father... ...this is the matter our property, business and respect. I know very well to whom I should hand it over. Take this. Everybody do your work now. - Yes. - Greetings! Father, I'll return from the city. Son, even I'll go to the farm. Man! What are you doing? What do you think? Can't you get it? I won't leave him! Shankar! I'll not spare that Shankar today. Agent! Shankar! Come outside. Pauper of another village! Come outside. Are you coming out or shall I come inside? What is this madness? Why are you disturbing this society after getting drunk? May this society and you go to hell! Get lost. You! Come out. Or I'll start abusing your mother and sister. Come out. Mr. Chaurangi Lal, what are you doing? You've abusing outside the house after getting drunk! - What will son-in-law say? - How come he's your son-in-law? C'mon. Give the keys to me fast. - Listen. - Get lost! Listen, Mr. Chaurangi Lal. If you want the keys... ...ask your son-in-law. If he tells me, I'll give the keys to you. Who is he to give that order? This important person is ordering you. Give the keys fast. Look, if you want, you can kill me. But I'll not give you the keys without son-in-law's permission. - You won't give me the keys? - No. - Not even if I lose my life. - I'll break your head. Wait! What is going on? You're bullying after getting drunk! You're threatening a decent man! Don't you feel ashamed? You've forced me to become shameless. You're my son-in-law and I'm your father-in-law. But why is this outsider interfering between us? Who is he that you've given the entire responsibility to him? This is my wish. Who are you to interfere in my personal matters? Look, I know all the rules of the court. As per the law, all this property belongs... ...to your wife that means to my daughter. If you'll not give it, I'll go to the High court and Supreme court. I'll go to the parliament and ask for my property. Everything belongs to me, but he is enjoying it. - Give me my share back. - Then go. Go to the parliament and ask for your share. The prime minister will give it to you. - In the parliament... - Get lost! Did you push me? Your own father-in-law! Saw? He pushed his father-in-law? You're pushing an elderly person. You're listening to him and pushing me. Don't dare let this imbecile drunkard step into my house again. Let's go, father. Sister-in-law, did you see how your son insulted me? It happened because of that old man, Shankar. Please explain to him. [CRYING] Did that old woman left? Stupid hag! [CRYING] Janki! Heard what they said about me? Go and explain them. Are you leaving me too? Janki! Everyone left and I'm standing alone like a stray dog. Why are you staring at me? They've thrown me out of the house. I'll throw you out of the village. Get lost. - Let's go. C'mon. Don't watch the show! From where did this air filled mattress come? Get up, master. Have some hot tea. Hot tea for me early in the morning! And that too with so much respect. Wow, lame! You're just limb by your body, but you've a big heart. You're great! I salute you! Salute, me? Why? Because you've brought hot tea for me. Give. I didn't get tea since 2 days. - Master! This tea isn't for you, but for me. Yes. He's my secretary. - What? - Yes. - Greetings! Secretary, didn't you bring today's newspaper for me? - Hindi? - The English newspaper isn't in the market yet. So I brought Hindi newspaper, sir. Fine, sit afar. I enjoy reading the newspaper by sipping tea. And I don't see stupid people while drinking tea. Look at this. Now you just read the newspaper. And if you pronounce even one word wrong, I'll force this stick into your mouth. Don't worry. This poor fellow has become mad due to family tensions. - He will... - What are you saying? I'm ordering meal. Secretary, go to the Royal hotel and... ...get some special leftover fried bread, mutton and fried rice. Ok, sir. Do I beg something for you too? Stupid lame! Will you go or shall I break even your other leg? - He became alright! - He's a part time lame. After reaching the road, he'll become blind. When will you go blind? - Tomorrow. - Oh god! You've lost everything but not your arrogance. What's going on in front of our house in the morning? Look at my condition. Even these stupid beggars are mocking me. - Look... - Shut up! Janki, tell son-in-law to let me come inside. I promise you I'll not misbehave again. And I even promise That in my next birth, I'll be only your husband. Not at all. I'm tired of you in this life only. - I agree to become an animal in my next life. - Really? - But I don't want to be your wife. - Why? - And listen. - Yes. - I want to improve my daughter's life. - Yes. I can't put her life at stake because of you. So I'll not tell son-in-law to take you inside the house. No. Just listen... Janki, at least give me one cup of tea. O god! Even this beggar gets tea here... It is good that the evil person left. O god! Listen. This fool is still here. Last night when you were lying down on the road... ...I thought that you've lost respect as a father-in-law. But now I've know that you've lost respect as a husband too. Your position is worse than my limb secretary. - Listen to me. - Yes. Please sit afar. - My reputation is being affected. - Rascal! I'll not spare you! - Give me something, sir. - Give me food. - Bony! - What's it? Come here. - What is this? - 10 paisa. - For what? - I've given it as alms. - Alms? - Yes. These days you can't buy even dirt for 10 paisa. And you're giving me 10 paisa as alms! We donate more money than this. Take 1 rupee from me. Drink tea and bless my kids who are not yet born. Go! Stupid! He's ruining the reputation of beggars. Imbeciles! Shameless! Who are you? Master, you? What are you doing in the beggar's line without a license? Beggar! I'm not here to beg! Then are you in beggar's place to offer charity. - My daughter Neha has gone inside. - Really? - I've come to meet her. - To beg? - No! - There she is. - Mother, just give me 5 rupees. - Daughter Father, you? What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. I've been ruined. Son-in-law has thrown me out of the house. I'm hungry. I don't have any support. Do something. Please tell Ravi and take me inside the house. He won't refuse you because you're his wife. - No, father. - Why? Because he has still not given me the position of a wife. What? What are you saying? I'm saying the truth. He hasn't even spoken properly to me until today. In such conditions, how can I recommend you? So this is the matter! I can handle such situations easily. Don't worry. Go home. Your life will change in the night. I didn't get you. Do as I tell you to. He'll accept you and forgive me too. - "Come near me. - No." - "Look into my eyes. - No." - "Come near me. - No." - "Look into my eyes. - No." "My beloved, do you remember that promise?" "Yes. What is the need to say?" - "Don't trouble me like this. - No." - "Control your heart. - No." "My beloved, do you remember that promise?" "Yes. What is the need to say?" - "Come near me. - No." - "Look into my eyes. - No." "Read my eyes' gestures." "Understand the language of my heart." "O my beloved! What is this magic?" "The atmosphere is also very pleasant." "It is explaining something to me." "This intoxication is spread everywhere." "Don't try to trap me with your sweet talks." - "Come near me. - No." - "Look into my eyes. - No." "The loneliness is romantic." "Your movements are charming." "I've come into your arms." "The weather is seducing." "Our desires are kindled." "I've lost my heart on the way." "Don't entice me with your styles." - "Come near me. - No." - "Look into my eyes. - No." - "Don't trouble me like this. - No." - "Control your heart. - No." "My beloved, do you remember that promise?" "Yes. What is the need to say?" - "Come near me. - No." - "Look into my eyes. - No." Listen... ...why are you ignoring a woman's desires? I don't ask you for any wealth, jewelry or property. I'm just asking for your love. After all, even I'm a woman. I've to beg to that old man even to get ordinary medicine. Mind your language first of all. And if you feel shy to ask, don't ask. No. You'll have to remove that old man from our house first. What was this noise? It was the noise of your idea. - Really. - And its echo has scared the birds of the nearby villages. - Congrats! - Shut up! By calling a noble person, old man, you're insulting him. And you're not speaking... ...but your father's wrong teaching is speaking. Today I'm warning you for the first and the last time. If you'll say anything against father again... ...you can't even what I'll do to you. - Master, I'm very scared. - Yes. I feel as if slaps, kicks and abuses are going to be showered. - Yes. - So it's very dangerous to sit here. - Let's go. - Let's go. Pushpa! Tomorrow come at the same time. Then we'll play the game of love. Do come, don't forget. Go. Stupid old man! He's staring at us. What are you staring at? Haven't you seen me before? Don't you feel embarrassed to do this sin? What if you become the mother of his illegitimate child? The entire village taunt you. Then where will you take that child? What do I do, uncle? He threatened me and molested me forcefully. And then he promised me that if I accept him... ...he'll give me a farm with water pump for cultivation. And I... [CRYING] Sister! Sister! Aunt! Uncle! Come soon. What's it? Why are you screaming? Aunt, there is good news. Sister is vomiting. - Really? - Yes. Congrats, sister-in-law! You're going to become a granny. Wow! This means that I'm going to be a grandfather. Thanks a million, god. Daughter... I used to dream about a grandson daily. Today you've fulfilled that dream. I'll invite all the villagers for lunch. I'll tell the confectioner to make delicious sweets. - In the entire village... - Stop it! Why are you so happy? Why do you want to distribute sweets? He has never accepted me as a wife since our marriage. He has never even touched me. - We're husband and wife for namesake. - What? Daughter, why did you hide this from me till today? - Let him come home today. - No, sister-in-law. You'll not tell anything to Ravi. It's a personal matter of a husband and a wife. Daughter... ...think deeply about the circumstances... ...when Ravi married you. Now it's up to you to make him accept you. You'll have to tolerate everything... ...till old memories aren't wiped out. And by revealing the secrets of your personal life like this... ...in front of everyone, you're insulting your duty as a wife. Then why did you put me in this trap? Tell me. My life has been ruined. It's better to die than live like this. God doesn't even kill me. [CRYING] Father, where are you going? - I'm going to the village. - Why? Because you've not obeyed my order. What order? I didn't get you married with Neha to fill her life with grief... ...and snatch the right from her which she deserves. Chanda has died. She can't come back, right? Then why are you ruining Neha's life in her memory? What's her fault? You've always given only happiness to others... ...so why are you filling your wife's life with sorrow? As far as I'm concerned... I considered Neha as my Chanda the day you married her. Neha is my daughter. I can't see her cry in grief. - Father! - I don't want to hear anything. If you respect me a little... You'll give the same love and respect to Neha... ...that you gave to Chanda. [CRYING] Daughter Neha. My daughter Chanda used to wear... ...this sari and jewellery. I've brought them for you today. Because... You're at Chanda's place now. I'm not your father, but I... I consider you my daughter... And I wish you to take Chanda's place in... Ravi's heart. Father! Say once again. Father. After Chanda's death, I felt that... ...nobody could take Chanda's place in my life again. But... You've taken that place today. Father, your love is a favour on me. - And your gifts are debt on me. - No, daughter. The relationship of a daughter and a father is very pure. It is far away from things like favour and debt. Keep them, daughter. Be happy! Live long! [CRYING] Don't get sad on seeing all this. These sari and jewellery belongs to sister Chanda. Father told me to wear them. If you feel bad, I'll take it off. Brother Chaurangi, how did this finger become crooked? Scoundrel! I went to eat chicken and fried rice in Royal hotel last night. After smelling the aroma of the food a dog followed me. I ran and that dog chased me. I fell down and wounded my finger. Consult a doctor fast. It could deteriorate and cause leprosy. - Leprosy? What is your intention? Nothing, Mr. Chaurangi. - You've already thrown me out of the house. And by saying leprosy do you intend to throw me out of the village? - No. I didn't say that. It is strange. - Get lost! You're acting too smart! You may be suffering from leprosy. What happened to you? Father! - Father! - What's it, daughter? I'm not calling you, but father. Father! What's it, daughter? Return soon from the farm. - I've to go to the market with you. - Ok. Listen. Hold out your hands. What is this? I'm training you to beg. Your life is like that filthy hut... ...which doesn't has a roof, floor or any wall. What is left in your life? You were spurned from the position of a father-in-law. Your position as a husband was taken away from you. Only one position of a father was left. Just now Neha has snatched that too. Now what is left in your life? Hold this bowl and come to beg. You'll be in profit. Fine. Let them trouble me. Today they're more powerful. The day my son will be released from prison, I'll become powerful. Vikram! My ace man! My darling! The apple of my eyes! And I don't know what else. Come and hug me, son. You went to prison on the charge of rape. But here, my life was ruined. Now that you've returned, think of some evil plan. Please throw that idiot Shankar out and put me inside the house. At least answer me. What are you thinking? - I'm not thinking, but blaming my destiny. - Why? Because I was born to a sinner father like you. I wish I had born in the house of a noble person like Mr. Shankar. Maybe he would've not given me enough to eat, but at least he would've been taught me to live... ...with decency and honesty. At least my great brother-in-law... ...wouldn't have been embarrassed because of me. At least I would've done social service along with him. Are you the same Vikram or his duplicate? You don't seem to be my son. You've completely changed. Yes. I've changed. And I'll prove it to my mother and brother-in-law through hard work. - I'll definitely prove it. - Nobody will trust you. Nobody will trust a person who has erred... ...many times in the past. Got it. If I'll not be able to gain their trust, I'll commit suicide. Live long, son! The human, who realises his mistake... ...is even forgiven by god. - Father! - Enough! You're a great man, father! You've settled the wrecked life of my sister again. You've done the work that my sinner father should've done. I was a very bad human being, father. But I've completely reformed now. But I know... ...that my brother-in-law and mother won't trust me. - They won't forgive me. - What are you saying? - Brother. - Brother! - You're wrong. We wanted you to reform. Even your brother-in-law wanted the same thing. Son Ravi. ...forget about the past and forgive Vikram. No, father. I've troubled brother-in-law so much he'll never forgive me. Vikram! Let's go home. - May everyone be ruined! Come. Mother! Here comes this idiot! Shame! Master, shame on you. Today you've been thrown from one more position. First your son-in-law removed you. Then your daughter rejected you. Your wife disowned you. Only one son was left. And even he came and spurned you. I think it's better for you if you commit suicide in shame. C'mon, brothers. Have food. But uncle, Dhaniya has still not brought your food. - I'll eat your food. C'mon. - Fine. - Listen, brother. - Yes, brother. - Whom do you want to meet? - Mr. Ravi. Mr. Ravi has gone to the city. Any important work? - Yes. We've come from sugar factory. - Ok. I had to give Rs.50,000 advance to him for the purchase of sugarcane. Give it to me. I'll give it to him. What? To you? - Yes. I'm his father-in-law. - Really? - You're his father-in-law? - Yes. Do you've any doubt? Mr. Juman, I think that this insane is some fraud. - Greetings, madam. - Greetings! - Greetings! - Greetings! I came to give money to Mr. Ravi. Give this money to father. He's Mr. Ravi's father-in-law and my father. I apologise. I'll never repeat this mistake again. Now do you believe I'm Mr. Ravi's father-in-law? - Yes. - Fine. Take this. - Fine. - Greetings! - Thank you. Greetings! These people are very strange! They judge people from their clothes. Father, even you're in an odd state. - You've worn such dirty clothes. - So what? You shouldn't judge a man from his clothes. His soul doesn't become evil if he's wearing dirty clothes. Ok. Have food. Why did you bring the food? Where is Dhaniya? Today I'll feed you with my hands. Freshen up. I'll serve food. Ok. Keep this money safely in the cupboard. I'll freshen up. Father. This money? Father, Neha gave me 50,000 rupees... ...so that I can start my own business. And she told me not to say anything about this money to anybody. But father, I'm feeling very scared. If my brother-in-law finds this out... ...my sister's settled life would be ruined. Father, please keep this money with you. No, son. It's not wrong for a sister to help a brother... ...who has left the wrong path... ...and who wants to earn his living with honesty. Keep this money and you start a good business with this. As you wish, father. Please bless me so that I can start a new business. May god make you successful! And father, I've one more request. Till don't get success in my work... ...please don't tell anyone about this money. - Ok. I won't. - Swear upon me. Ok. I do. I'll not tell. - Go. - Yes, father. - Daughter Neha. - Yes, father. If son-in-law comes, tell him that the watchman is on a leave. So I'm going to the guard the farm. - Ok, father. I'll tell him. - Ok. "The stream meets the river." 'This is a good opportunity to kill Shankar.' It's so dark! Take care, master. It's night now. Snakes and scorpions come out to hunt. What are you doing? I'm not you girlfriend. Lowly man! Come. Tell me something. This road doesn't leads to your Pushpa's house. Where are you taking me through the farm at night? This is one of my plans. - Master. - Yes. I can see devil on your face. What evil plan are you hatching? I'll tell you. Pick up a stone first. - Stone? - Yes. - What will you do with the stone? Will you pick it up or not? Big bully! - Will that stone do? - Yes. So pick it up. Shall I pick it up? So shall I pick it up? - No. I can't lift it. - Really? You can bear the burden of your son-in-law's abuses... ...but you can't lift this small stone? Beggar, I say pick it up! I'm a weak beggar. I can't bear the burden of blessings. How can I bear the burden of this stone? Listen. You pick it up. I'll help you. Please go. Pick it up. What are you doing? Have you hung it? Pick it up. Apply force. Well done! Pick it up. Put your head underneath it. Your head. Yes. Up. Well done! This is very heavy. - Keep walking. - Very heavy. - You won't find it heavy after sometime. - Why? - You'll get used to it. - Yes. C'mon. I'll help you. [COUGHING] What are you doing? The burden is on my head and you're panting. I'm sharing your sorrows. It isn't right for you to lift the stone and pant too. So, you just lift the stone. I'll pant for you. [COUGHING] Father! Son Ravi, you? How come you're here at this time? Go and rest. It is your age to rest, father. You're coughing so much! Go home and sleep. But how will you sleep here leaving Neha alone? It's just for one night. You're not keeping well. Go. Fine. [COUGHING] What's the matter? I can't understand. He should be... Master! Are you dead? My master is dead! You used to dig holes for others. But you've fell into it and died. - Haven't you died yet? - Pick me up. C'mon. All my crying was in vain. All my hard work has been wasted. Oh my god! I think before carrying on my plan I'll die. I wish it would come true. I'll distribute sweets. Rogue! You always abuse me! Get lost! Hurry up! Nurse, arrange for the operation fast. Hurry up! Doctor, how is my son? I can't say anything right now. I'll have to do a major operation. And then life and death is in god's hands. [CRYING] "Sing with love, hail goddess!" "Everybody chant, hail goddess!" "Everyone sings together, hail goddess!" "The birds sing, hail goddess!" "After hearing about your miracles," "I've come to you." "O goddess of light... ...please fulfill the prayers... ...of a sorrowful heart." "Hail goddess!" "who has come to your threshold." "Goddess with chariot of lion" "who has come to your threshold." "Goddess with chariot of lion" "Goddess with chariot of lion, you've supported everyone," "Goddess with chariot of lion, you've supported everyone," "who has come to your threshold." "Goddess with chariot of lion" "who has come to your threshold." "Goddess with chariot of lion" "Goddess with chariot of lion" "Praise goddess of light!" "Sing with love, hail goddess!" "Everybody chant, hail goddess!" "Everyone sings together, hail goddess!" "The birds sing, hail goddess!" "There is complete darkness everywhere." "Darks clouds have gathered." "Please see to it that the apple of my eye," "isn't snatched away from me." "Today show us your immense powers." "The world will witness what you're capable of." "Today show us your immense powers." "The world will witness what you're capable of." "You listen to all our anguishes." "You listen to all our anguishes." "Goddess with chariot of lion, you've supported everyone," "who has come to your threshold." "Goddess with chariot of lion" "who has come to your threshold." "Goddess with chariot of lion" Uncle. Mr. Ravi has regained consciousness. Yes, father. Hail goddess! "Praise goddess with chariot of lion!" "Praise goddess of light!" "Praise goddess of light!" "Goddess with chariot of lion" "Hail goddess!" "who has come to your threshold." "Goddess with chariot of lion" "who has come to your threshold." "Goddess with chariot of lion" "Goddess with chariot of lion, you've supported everyone," Brother-in-law... you've recovered completely becaus of goddess Durga's blessings. Visit the temple before returning home. Mr. Ravi. - Greetings! - Greetings! I'm didn't met Mr. Shankar from many days. Please give this receipt to him. Which receipt? He bought Mr. Gopal's farm... ...for Rs. 50000. This is its receipt. Mr. Shankar has bought a farm? When? About a month ago. Pushpa, what happened? Yes. I had warned you that day. Today's you're vomiting. Soon that sin will take birth and... ...come in front of this entire world. Chaurangi Lal will be disgraced along with you. And it'll disrepute son-in-law too. With god's grace he narrowly escaped death. If he'll come to know about this, he won't be able to bear it. He doesn't have the courage to bear this shock now. Now what do I do, uncle? When the child will be born... ...everyone will come to know about it, isn't it? Listen. Go to some other village. How? I don't have any money. Even I don't have any money. Take this. Sell this ring in the market. I'll try to arrange for some more money. But take care that nobody else comes to know about it. Son-in-law's honour is at stake. Go. Everything will be fine. Keep quiet! C'mon. Son-in-law has come. Son-in-law has come. The items of the welcoming ceremony... Son-in-law has come. Come, Ravi. - Mr. Ravi, greetings! - Greetings! You've come once again. I told you now to come now. He has just returned from the hospital. Go, come later. - Son, rest inside. - Mr. Shankar, I badly need money now. So please return me the advance money. Father, return his money to him. - How much money is it? - 50,000 rupees. Father, why are you standing? Please go. Son, actually, that money is... Have you spent it for some purpose? No, child. How can I spend it without informing you? Then bring it. Neha, you bring it. It isn't there? Then where is it? Brother-in-law, please ask him... How did he get 50,000 rupees to buy the farm in the village. Vikram is lying, son-in-law. I've not bought any farm. What are you saying, Mr. Shankar? Are you losing your memory? You've bought a farm. And brother-in-law is its witness. Son Ravi, this is false. I had given his advance money to Neha to keep in the cupboard. Then he came to me one day with 50,000 rupees and said... Neha has given him that 50,000 rupees... ...to become self independent and start a new life. I didn't give any money to brother Vikram. Daughter, didn't you give him 50,000 rupees? No, father. But he told me that you've given it. And he told me not to say anything about it to anyone. So I promised him not to do so. He's definitely lying, brother-in-law. He's accusing me. He's taking advantage of my past life and trying to prove me culprit. But you know the truth. You've the receipt of the land that he has bought, right? This is absolutely false, son Ravi. Now you'll even say that you've neither betrayed nor cheated me. Sir... I've come to you today for justice. This respected man... ...lured me with a land worth 50,000 rupees. And in return he kept on molesting me like a beast. When I was pregnant with his child... I begged him to marry me... ...or else... I'll be disgraced in this world. He told me to abort this child. And he gave me this ring to bear all the expenses. - 'Accept this small gift. - No, child.' 'Please don't refuse.' I swear on my dead daughter Chanda. I really don't know what she is saying. - Shut up! - Look! Even I think... My father and brother had planned this... ...to throw him out of this house. Son Ravi... I don't know anything about 50,000 rupees. But I saw him giving this ring to Pushpa in our backyard. Son Ravi, it's true that I had given this ring to her. But there... - Son Ravi. - Brother-in-law. Ravi - Did you see his condition because of you? - Vikram, take him inside. - Son Ravi! - C'mon, brother-in-law. - Wait. I'll tell you the truth. - Listen to me. - You old fool, where are you going? - Son Ravi. - Get lost. Son Ravi, listen to me. I'll tell you everything. Son Ravi, wait. - Get lost! - Son Ravi, listen to me. - Get out. - I've not done anything. - Father. - Son Ravi, wait. - Out. - Father! - Son Ravi, wait. - I'm wrongly accused. Listen. - Father! - Wait. - Leave me! - Let go of me. - I've not done anything. - Wait. Listen to me. This is wrong. - Father! - Neha, come here. - Father! Who is your father? This swine? I'm your mother's husband. Then how come he's your father? - Get inside. - And listen to me, old man. Forget this house, if I ever see you even in this village, I'll kill you. Get it? Get lost now. Bastard! "Selfishness makes human stoop so low." "It takes a new form at every stage." "Our kin are worse than strangers here." "People are greedy for money here." "People are greedy for money here." "Fake pride and display exist here." "People betray themselves." "Such people live here." "Our life makes us face difficult stages." After returning from the jail, the way you had changed... ...and entered into Ravi's house... ...it had given the biggest shock of my life. [LAUGHING] But you've given my position back to me... ...by removing that Shankar from this house today. And you've proved that a son is always better than a father. I've done all this for you only, father. I couldn't bear to see stranger reigning in my father's place... ...and my father roaming in the lanes like a mad dog. Father, now your old age will surely pass in peace. And my sister and mother will rule. But what do I do about that Pushpa? You handle her. I'll ruin that Shankar. [LAUGHING] That scum Ravi had imprisoned me for 5 years. And today, I've looted his entire money and jewellery. We're even now. [LAUGHING] Shankar, have you seen such a mean brother... ...who is stealing wealth from his own real sister's safe? [LAUGHING] Friends, enjoy tonight. Because tomorrow morning we'll leave for city with his wealth. But master, what will we do to this Shankar? We'll make him drink poison. So that the people will think he committed suicide out of shame. Vikram, give 5,000 rupees to her and shut her mouth. Who are you? Me? Don't you recognise your father? Father? I've only one father. And that is this money. Look, you idiot. [LAUGHING] - From where did you bring this? - From Ravi's safe. [LAUGHING] - Have you become so evil, Vikram? - Evil? Have you forgotten about your evilness? You've always lived on other's money. In spite of a wife, you've an affair with this Pushpa. Who will call a bastard like you a father? Even in prison I had written bastard in the place of father's name. Did you see Chaurangi Lal... How the greed for wealth makes you forget human relationships? Today your son has become your enemy. You still have time to stop him. And repent for all your sins, Chaurangi Lal. I'll do it. I'll definitely repent. Vikram... ...your small advice and slap taught me the lesson... ...which I couldn't have learned in my whole life. So I'll repent for all my sins today. Really? How will you repent? - How? - Yes. I'll not let you take these jewellery and money out of this village. [LAUGHING] By the way, I've learned all the misdeeds from you. But after staying for 5 years in the jail... I've learned one misdeed more than you have. And it is that if your father become a hurdle in the way of wealth... ...you should break that hurdle too. - Give me this bag. - No. - Give me this bag. - No. - You will not! Get lost. - Give me this bag. - No. - Give me this bag. - No. - Give me this bag. - No. - Bastard! Give this bag to me. - No. Ravi! I had my doubts that this is the plan of both father and son. I just wanted to see how low you can stop for money. For money I've already hit my old father. Now a young man will face a young man. Son Ravi! - No. Leave this bag. - Get lost! Son Ravi! Forgive me, father. My fraud relatives accused you of evil deeds. God glitters only after it's burnt in flame. Similarly we've to suffer pain in order to show our... ...true qualities to the world. Son! Ravi! Vikram! Vikram! Vikram! What did you, Chaurangi? I had raised this evil boy. And I've repented for my sins by killing him. I was a selfish man... Who lived for himself and not for his wife or daughter. And I'm such a sinner... Who destroyed the house where I lived. So generous people... ...like you are needed in this house. Bhiku... Bhiku, my friend. I've met you at the right time. You always used to taunt me and make me understand. But I never tried to understand. You always used to say the truth. You're not a beggar, but an angel. - And I'm the beggar of beggars, Bhiku. - No, master. Everybody is a beggar in this world. We chase food when we are hungry. So we're beggars for food. These greedy people who love wealth chase it. So they're beggars of wealth. These immoral people... Are greed for lust. Because they're beggar for lust. These leaders try to get votes because they're beggar of votes. Master, If you think deeply you'll realize... ...every human runs after something all the time. Every human is a beggar for one thing or another. But the only difference is that some lucky beggars... Get all good virtues. And some unlucky beggars get vices. Wow, Bhiku! You're absolutely right. But for a cunning beggar like me... ...even death penalty isn't enough. You've spoken like a king. Like my king. I'm the minister of this king. This minister will wait and beg outside the prison for his king. You'll return. Right, master? - Bhiku! - For me! Return for my sake, master. Let's go.
