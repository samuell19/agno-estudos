[music playing] Ew, Bobbi, I don't want to talk about it Now is a perfect time to talk about it. Let it go, Baby. I don't want to let it go. You're my tenacious little tiger, aren't you? Rawr. You make me crazy. You are crazy. About you. No way. And you're crazy about me, right? No way. And you're making me crazy with that music. That's the one. You do what? Come on, Travis. We only have a week's vacation. We've been on the road for four hours, OK? Two of those hours were spent at that secluded little-- Travis, look out! Get the first aid kit out of the back! [suspenseful music playing] [sounds of a struggle] Damn it, she's fast! Run! Get her! Get her! Run! Help! No! No, please! [screaming] Travis! No. Stop! Here, Honey. Let me help you. Bobbi! Bobbi! Shit. Ah, shit. You've been in a very bad accident. You've sustained a number of serious internal injuries. Here. You have to take these. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so eat up. [crying] Oh, Travis! Hey, Handsome. Want a ride? Sorry I'm late. Thanks, Jenn. Hello. Have a seat. What about Albuquerque? Anything? No. Miss Firkin, would you please not smoke in my office? Wyatt, what happened in Wyoming? I thought you said you had a solid lead. That case had no connection on the abduction of Bobbi Ryland. Yeah, but how do you know that? Because it's my job to find out. Yeah, but how do you know? Hey. Travis, was Bobbi involved in any type of religious group? Any connection with any type of cult activity, anything like that? What are you getting at? Another girl was kidnapped last week out of a trailer park, about 250 miles from where Bobbi was taken. Pretty blonde, blue eyes. You do I mean what I say, Wyatt. You don't get the guys that took Bobbi, I will. I'm going to kill every one of them. I didn't hear that, Travis. How long, Travis? How long is this going to take? I don't know what else to do. I loved her, too. [knocking] Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Yeah, well, fuck you then, whoever you are. [interposing voices] That's loaded! No shit! I thought you had another six months. Out on good behavior Couldn't believe it when little sis wrote me about Bobbi. They took her in fucking broad daylight? Yeah, I wish I would have had one of these. I would have shot that witch so fast. - Who? - A woman was driving the car. She dies. How many others? At least four. I was seeing so many stars when I went down, it could have been 20. Cops? Well, for the first month or two, they were all over the place. They never found any real clues. It was a total set up with that motorcycle, man. About an hour earlier, there was a guy staring at Bobbi at a Stop 'n Go. He was in the next aisle, and I didn't get a look at him. The worst part is, the Illinois police found two cases that were similar, and they found pieces of torn jeans like the ones Bobby was wearing with blood all over them. It was her blood type, and then-- Like Bobby's the only one who wears a size five 501 blue jeans and has a type B blood. They never found a body? She's alive. She's alive. Where do you think she is? Different times, I've thought Seattle, San Jose, Tucson, Albuquerque. Travis has been in 25 states in 21 weeks. Debbie combs the shit out of the papers and gets on the phone all over the country. She's helping me out a lot. Thank god she's got that [inaudible] line at work. I put the pieces together best I can. I get out and I go drive. I look and I ask questions. And I get fucking madder and madder trying to find out where the hell she is and just bring her back, man. We'll get her. It's time to call the posse. Who? DEBBIE: Who? Don't worry. You're going to love these guys, if I can get them. Travis, was there any communication between you or anybody else? Any demands or ransom note? No, nothing. Well, that's a clue. I'll see you. [tires squealing] [gunshots] Travis, get away from that door. DEBBIE: [screaming] [inaudible] Travis, no! Who are these people? Oh, god, let's get out of here. [gunshots] Do you think we lost them? Yeah, I think so. What the hell was that? It was just this guy's cousin I killed. - What? - What? It was an accident! His bark is worse than his bite. Get out of town, man. I did. Hey, I'm hungry. You guys want to get a burger? Marion, we've got a situation here. No, you are not to negotiate on her behalf. It's not your job! Do not take a personal check as a deposit. What? It's Patrice again. She's just gone off the deep end completely. You know how they do sometimes. They're okay for a while, and then they just snap. God damn it. God damn it! She should have been good for at least two more. Mary, I've got to go here. Yeah. Listen, don't touch her. Don't force her. Just let her do as much as she wants, which will be all of it. Got it. Damn it. [glass shatters] [sounds of drilling] Take it easy. This is ridiculous. I feel like The Princess and the Pea. Where the hell did these come from? You didn't expect me to leave them in complete stranger's car, did you? Since when did you start transporting guns? They're not mine. Why am I not surprised by that? They're Loch's. That's how I know he's going to be here. He doesn't like to be away from his babies too long. Does this have anything to do with that cousin guy? And who's Loch? The cousin guy is pissed at me. Loch? He hates me. Why? Life. So now you're going to kill the guy? No he's in the posse. You mean he's going to come with us? Yeah, he wouldn't miss it for the world. Why? You'll see. What the hell are we doing here? He does a lot of business in this part of town. Yeah, well what kind of business? Put the gun down. Yo, man. What's happening? I know Chopper. Where's Chopper? Boy's fucking dead man. Vino, I did time with Vino. Vato's six feet under, homes. Oh, no. What's Loch? Who the fuck is Loch, man? Get him! [threatening sounds] Come on, man! [gunshot] Who the fuck is this wimp? He's my best friend from fifth grade. Like I'm supposed to believe that shit. Hey, Lonnie. Man, are you selling us defective shit here? What's your problem, man? You want to die? - Come on, Lonnie. I wouldn't lie to you. You know that. Ask him who our seventh grade art teacher was. We never had seventh grade art class. Right. See? No art class? Damn. That would piss [gunshot] me [gunshot] off. [gunshot] Best friends, huh? You didn't tell him about the-- No way, Loch, man. No way. - Don't call me that! - Lighten up. He doesn't know what it means. Yeah, well, he'd better not ever know, huh? So, we going to get to kill some people or what? [gunshots] Hey, you're OK, man. [sirens] - Love this guy or what? - Or what. Yo, Reb. Take this piece. [sirens] So, what's the deal? - We've got to get his girl. - How much? - Run! - How much? Run! [dramatic music playing] So, how much? We'll work it out. You bet your ass we will. I hate to remind you about this, Loch, but she was my sister's best friend, and besides, you know, I did save your-- All right, man. We'll work it out. Thanks, man. So, let's go get the professor And Sue. Let's get Sue. Ah, man. Not Sue. He drives me fucking crazy. Oh, like that's going to be a personality change for you now, right? Shut up, asshole. Do you know where to find him? Hey, I'm part Indian, man. Oh, yeah, Loch-- Lonnie! Lonnie. This is Travis. I'd check the safety on that thing before I'd go pointing it south. You're OK, kid. He's a jerk. So let's go get the rest of the posse. Where's the stuntman at? Where is the stuntman at? Does anybody know where the stuntman is? Robert! - Yes, sir. - God damn it. I told Sterling I don't want anything to do with that wacko stuntman. There It be 1,700 guys in the Stuntman's Association, and we got a hire Suicide McVeigh? Then where the hell is he? Find him will you, please? Yes, sir. Go, go! Jesus Christ, come one! We got a movie to make here. After this shot, we can all go home. I got some tickets to the Tyson fight. Get away from me. Oh, you feel so good. I want a part in your next movie. I'll give you a part in my next movie. Whatever you want. Where is the stuntman at? I can't get enough of you! Mr. McVeigh, We're waiting on you. Mr. McVeigh! We're waiting on you. You're not going to cost me my job. I got a Stallone picture coming up next week. Let's go. I've got to go. I'll see you later. It's nice to see you could make it, Mr. McVeigh. We're not bothering you, are we? All right. OK, This is what I need you to do. Go down-- - I got it. No problem. Are you listening to me?

I'm going to go with the boys, all right? I'll be back. I've got to go. Oh! Jeez. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow, my ankle. Oh! Jeez! We need you to sign this. I'm not signing anything until I get this checked out by a specialist. It's just a [inaudible] sheet. You're done working. In - Oh! My work has just begun. Get me up. Easy, easy. Aren't you a stuntman? [explosion] Shit! [explosion] [explosion] [explosion] Hey, Professor. How you doing old bud? How you doing, Reb? How you doing, Lonnie? Hey, Professor, we need your help. How would you like to help us blow some people up? No, man. I ain't going back to prison. It's not going to happen. I'm having too much fun on the outside, man. I'm not talking about jewelry stores or banks. This is a rescue. My girlfriend. She was kidnapped six months ago. Police have almost given up. We haven't, and I won't. Sue, is this legit? Talk to me. What's legit? I've got a week or two off before my next gig. I'm bored already. Bottom line, man. How much we talking? We'll work it out. Come on. [explosion] OK. Let's go. So, how's that foot? Show biz. ANSWERING MACHINE: Hey, Deb. It's Travis. Well, I met the posse. OK. This is going to be interesting. It's about 4:30. I'm heading back to town to pick up some stuff. Don't work too hard. I'll see you in a bit, OK? [phone ringing] [ANSWERING MACHINE CONTINUES TO PLAY] Yeah, look, I'm tired, too. Yeah, it went OK. They were very eager. Aren't they always? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're having trouble with who? Just hold on a minute. [answering machine stops] Now, what then? You know, it's shit like this that really makes me hate this job. Yeah, well, I've got something more important to worry about. Yes, it is more important. I'm talking about a real emotion. Something you would have no idea about. OK. Thank you. Thank you. You took care of it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, OK? Now I've got to go. Damn it. Hey, you're home. How are you doing? Hi, yourself. What's up? Hey. Hi. Deb, let me introduce the posse to you. This is Loch, that's Lonnie. This is Sue. Hi. Hi. That's enough. [inaudible] And this is the Professor. - Hi. - Hi. How are you doing? So, this is the Dirty Not-Quite-Half-a-Dozen, huh? Oh, I bet these bad guys are going to be all kinds of scared. - Would you guys like a beer? - Yeah, sure. Yeah. So, there was all this interstate brouhaha bullshit between the Chicago and the LAPD. You never saw such egos in your lives. Now Bobbi's mother, lovely and totally phony Mrs. Ryland, has had a complete nervous breakdown and is basically a veg. Now, Mr. Ryland, god, he is such a jerk. He was always telling Bobbi that I was such a bad influence on his little princess, and that she shouldn't waste her college educated time on a loser friend like me. Now he says that he can't handle the pressure anymore, and he wants Bobbi declared legally dead that he and Mrs. Thorazine can get on with their lives. I've got to go out for a bit, guys. Travis, I'm going to be out of town for a couple of days, in case you try and call, but I can pick up messages on my machine. So leave me a number where I can reach you, OK? I really hate these business trips, but somebody's got to make some money, right? Yeah. Great, thanks. So, what do you do? Besides take care of Travis? Sales. Import/export. Beverly Hills office. The whole spiel. Good bucks? Well, the overhead is kind of high, and sometimes you do have a hard time getting product. But we pretty much pre-sell, so when we do get product we can sell, we get top dollar for it. And the best part about it is we deal in cash only, so we don't have to worry about having to collect. [inaudible] Maybe after we get Travis's girlfriend back, the four of us can go out to dinner sometime. Like London or something. Yeah. Right. [crickets and night sounds] [suspenseful music playing] [doorbell ringing] Mr. Ryland. Good evening, sir. Evening? It's almost morning. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't realize. It's about Bobbi. What? May I come in, sir? MRS. RYLAND: Nigel, is that the mailman? I told him no cottage cheese! Didn't give him a tip. What about Bobbi? We're going to bring her home. What do you mean? I mean, we're going to find her and bring her home. Her body? No, her. Whole. Altogether. Alive. Who is we? You and Wyatt? No, sir. I mean, Detective Wyatt has tried. You know, I mean, I think he has tried, but I have some other people. What people? Some private detectives I know. Oh, good god, Travis! I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars on the best private detectives money can buy, and what did it get us? Zero, zilch! I have turned my life inside out over this. I couldn't work. I've lost thousands and thousands of dollars in revenue while trying to find my daughter. I've got a lunatic wife upstairs who thinks she's Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. I have worked with the police. I have worked without the police. I have worked around the police. The morgue, the private dicks, even that idiot girlfriend of hers, Debbie the Ditz. She is not a idiot, and she's definitely not a ditz. Oh, whatever. As a matter of fact, it wasn't for her-- Look, Travis, I don't want to discuss her or this with you at this time or at this hour. You obviously have nothing to report to me about my daughter. Nothing's happening out there. Nobody's found out anything about the location of my daughter. Nothing. There's no live girl, there is no dead girl. Nothing. She is not dead. You don't know how much I want to believe that, Travis. You couldn't know. Bobbie is not dead! I think she is. God Damn it, Ryland, she's not dead! You better leave. Look. I know you want her alive. These detectives, they're working for me. When we find her, would you offer them a reward? Go, Travis. When-- OK. If we bring her back alive, wouldn't it be worth it to you to offer these men a reward? Yes. Yes, it'll be the happiest money I ever spend. Thank you. How much is it going to take? A hundred grand. It's not for me. Don't tell me, OK? MRS. RYLAND: Nigel, the begonias. The begonias are in bloom. Burn the tulips. You're coming home, Bobbi. You're coming home. Three-quarters of a mile down on the right hand side. 1132. It's a big grey building. OK. You got it? Move it out, now. Come on, guys. Computer right here. [chatter] Flip it around for me. Thank you very much. Hey, Professor. Not bad. Big improvement over your last place. Hey, Professor, I'll tell you what this place needs. A little female ambience. There. Guys, listen to this article Deb gave me. "Nevada state police are investigating the suspects in the area being implicated in the kidnap and murder of Leslie Meyers, whose body was found last night with strange symbols painted on her left cheek, with what appeared to be, at first to be human blood, but after a clinical tests the Carson City coroner has announced it was indeed blood from a rare species of jackrabbits found only in Haiti." [motor cycle revving] Hey, uh, P, where's the bombs and stuff? Hey, man, put that down, Reb. You're shaking that. That's nitro, man. Are we dead yet? Way to go, Reb. Einstein. "The waitress at the coffee shop who last saw Leslie gave detectives a bizarre description of a man wearing a--" [gunshots] [motorcycle engines] [sirens] Old friends of yours? New friends of yours? Kind of. Somebody that's like them. Or you. Did you see anyone else? Nope. Happened too fast. Any ideas? I don't like this, Travis. You know I'm on your side, but be careful. Except for your fall guy friend, all these other guys have records. All kinds of shit. Yeah, well, remember what I said to you, Wyatt. Travis-- Want me to search the van, sir? No, that won't be necessary. These people were attacked. They're not under suspicion for anything. You sure about that, sir? Yes. OK. I'm going to tell you one more time: be careful Travis! [crying] I can't believe it. I just can't believe this. Look, I've been here a while, and they go easier on you if you eat. They hate it when you don't eat. Why? Why do you think? [woman screaming] MAN: Shut up! [woman screaming] MAN: Shut up, you bitch! Do you think it was that Cousin guy who's so mad at Reb? Who? Hey! They've got a girl! Let's get them! [tires squealing] God damn it [inaudible] [tires squealing] Loch, get the guns. Don't call me that! Turn right, turn right! [tires squealing] [tires squealing] [suspenseful music playing] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! [party music playing] Whoa! Hey! Look, Sandy! Phi Beta Kappa must be having a Rambo party. [music playing] Come on, come on! Here, make yourself useful, all right? I'll be out in a second. You better watch it, sucker! [night sounds] [ominous music] [horse whinnies] RADIO: This is Casey Masterson at KLOB. It's about 20 minutes past the midnight hour, a beautiful moonlit night. The kind of night that makes you remember the great love you once had and, if we're lucky, we're able to find again You never called me back! I was busy! [crying] You were busy! Too busy for me? RADIO: We've been getting an awful lot of requests here at the station for this beautiful ballad, and it's been climbing steadily up the charts to number one. A beautiful song for a beautiful night. TRAVIS: Don't push me, Bobbi. BOBBI: Then don't push me away! TRAVIS: I'm not. BOBBI: Yes, you are. Every time I even hint at the future, you clam up or you change the subject. TRAVIS: Just don't push me No! No! [laughter] WOMAN (ON RADIO): And here we have Pauletta Pearson and Tony Reynolds Try to Understand. You know what I want. (SINGING): I know it ain't easy, the change of course I've taken. But I tend to risk it all and play the fool for something so real. Just to go back in time. to the words that cut so deeply And erase the things we said bring back the fire to the love that we feel. Try to understand I'm lost within a memory. I reach out for you and find you're not there. Baby, can't you see? Your love lies deep inside of me. I need you close to me now. Please try to understand.

I know we've been at this awhile, and I'm a little tired, but I've got to ask you one more time. Where were you yesterday at 4:30, Tony? Window shopping. Window shopping? Is that what you told me before? Yep. You sure? Yeah. Can I have another cigarette? You lying sack of shit! You haven't got nothing on me, Wyatt. Nothing. Nothing. Damn it, Frank, that was real stupid. Stupid? Who do you think you're dealing with? Look, I'm sick discussing this. It's done. Did you get the money? I mean, let's discuss something important for a moment, here. I know you told me not to disturb you, but the O'Briens are here. Speaking of money. That's quite all right, MaryAnn. You just send them right on in. OK. Mrs. O'Brien. Hi. Hi. How are you doing? Mr. O'Brien. Hi. How are you? I have some good news for you. Some really wonderful news. Really? [phone ringing] Yeah. Travis? Glad you called. No. Nope. What you might want to know is that we're releasing one Tony DeLonghi at 5:00 PM. Yeah. Give me a break! If you didn't have your fucking nose up between his legs all the time trying to kiss his ass! Well, that's a laugh! You'd suck her snot if she asked you! Hey, I'm sorry. You stupid, dumb hick! Excuse me, sir? Sir? Unlike the one who bred you, sir, I was raised with some manners. That's fill it mig non! You mean filet mignon? Shit. You know what she said. Leave the fucking local yokels alone. He ain't worth the $1.99 he makes a month. Him and his fucking horse. Get a car! Yeah, get a car! Yo, Curt, man, you gotta clean this stuff up. Frank's going to kill you for messing up that steak! Hey, fuck you! You remember the fucking receipt? You dummy, you. Jesus Christ. God damn. Crazy son of a bitch. [music playing] [coughing] You've got to help me. I'm having some sort of reaction. Help me. Please. Help me. I don't feel good. I'm having a seizure. I need some help. I need some help. Help me. I'm having some sort of a reaction. Please, help me. Oh, god, I don't feel good at all. I'm going to get sick. [people yelling] I'll kill you son of a bitches. - Yeah, right! - Let me go! Let me go! You son of a bitch! I'll kill you! [struggle continues] I'll kill you son of a bitches! Yeah, right. Let me go! Probably had a good time [inaudible] What the fuck is this shit? We just want to make sure we don't miss any details of your confession. What confession? Who's the fuck are you guys? Who the fuck are you, Tony DeLonghi? More importantly, who the fuck do you work for? Work for? Oh, that's a laugh. I've been out of work for months now. Haven't you guys heard, there's a recession in this country. Who do you work for, huh? Who gives you the orders? Orders? I don't take orders from anybody. Look, dickface, I'm not in the mood for your stupid semantic bullshit. Now where's the fucking girl? Girl? Perhaps he doesn't know, man. Like, perhaps we made a mistake. Think about it, dude. What are you fucking talking about? You know, you curse an awful lot. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. What are you fucking talking about? Who gives a flying fuck about how much I swear? You don't have any idea what I've been through over this ordeal, do you? Hey, Travis, chill out, man. Chill out? Chill out? Where the fuck is Bobbi? I don't know, man. Travis, I really don't think he knows. Shut the fuck up! This is your fucking posse? Hey, Travis give me a break, all right? When things get tough, these guys are going to be here for you 1000%. Oh, yeah? What's this asshole going to do? Throw his typewriter at them? This nutcase here. What's he going to do? Fill some rubbers up with water and pitch them off the roof? This little wimp, this little wimp is so worried about someone calling him a name, he can't even piss without shaking. This is total bullshit, man I was better off looking for Bobbi on my own. Posse? Pussy is more like it. Boy, you really need to get laid. You're gonna die. Maybe. You. You're definitely going to die. You haven't got the guts to do it. You couldn't kill a man. Where's Bobbi? I don't know. Hey, man, why don't you get a grip! Right now! Who the fuck are you? None of us even know who this Babette broad is. What exactly are you paying us? You're paying us squat! Like Sue said, we might even die on this thing. So why don't you chill out and quit being such a prick! Might die? Might die? Who's the one who keeps running to the phone, huh? Somebody tipped somebody off where we were yesterday. Might die? Somebody is definitely gonna die. [gunshot] Talk to me. One. Two. We weren't supposed to kill you. Talk! Talk! I mean, I don't think it would have cared if we did, but that wasn't our orders. Your orders? Those orders that you don't take from anybody? I got a phone call, this guy I work for sometimes. They're mostly scare jobs, . They just want us to go in and rough somebody up a little bit, shake them up, detour them, sort of scare the shit out of them. Who's they? I don't know. Frank just always uses we, like, we need you to take care of something. Frank? Yeah, I don't know his last name. Where's Bobbi? Man, I swear, I swear, I never heard of no girl named Bobbi. This guy, Frank, he's smart. He's not going to tell me anything. I don't know what the hell they do out there. Out where? Out in the boonies. I don't know where it is. I'm the detour man. Anytime anybody gets within 100 miles of the place, I get a call to dissuade them from coming. So where is this place? What, east, north, south, west, what? I don't know. I mean it, I really don't know. You know, I hate it when people think I'm dumb I really hate it. Kind of makes me crazy. Crazy. Really fucking crazy, man. You know what I mean? This kind of fucking crazy. Crazy, crazy. Fucking crazy, Tony. Crazy, Tony, real fucking crazy. Would you like to know how fucking crazy it makes me? See this? Fucking crazy, man. Real fucking crazy. Fuck. You know what I mean? Huh? Where is this place, Tony? I swear to god, man, I don't know. Where? Please. Have you ever heard of Vinnie Van Gogh? Oh, man. Three seconds. Ah, man! One. Two. About 200, maybe 300 miles northeast of here, I think. I've never been there. I don't know where it is. I knew this guy once who worked for him. I think he said it was somewhere near Ravina. I've never seen him since. I never laid eyes on this Frank guy, and I swear on my life, I've never seen no girl named Bobbi or otherwise. Take off your clothes. Let's go. Get up! Come on! Come on, Tony. We haven't got all night. Whoa, baby, look at that, huh? [taunting continues] Socks. Nothing. What do I look like? Your maid? Anything else you'd like to tell us? I swear, I don't know anything else. I never even knew who pays me. when I got back from a job, there'd be an envelope under the mat. Once I didn't get to finish a job, and there was no envelope. I swear. That's it. That's it. Get out of here. Come on, let's go! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! You're about 20 or 30 miles from anybody or anything. Good night, Tony DeLonghi. We'll be sure to say hi to Frank for you. Come on! I really don't think he knew what was going on? [laughter] Fuckin' A! That was beautiful, man! Touchdown! [celebrating] We should all win Academy Awards for that one. Man, you had me going! When I saw you smear that stuff all over your face, I thought I was going to lose it right there on the spot. It's not that. What is this stuff made of? Good thing I remembered to put blanks in this gun. All right. Now the real fireworks begin. Let's go. Oh, by the way. The part about you guys not getting paid? We get Bobbi and you four guys split a hundred grand. [cheering] [dogs barking] What's that? A dog. No shit, Sherlock. Damn. You don't take your job serious, do you? What's to take? Except my paycheck. This job is cush city, man. We don't have to do jack shit. We don't even have to listen to the bone unless we're doing bone watch. Oh, yeah. Sometimes we've gotta dig a hole, we got to fix things. Big deal. Chill out, man. Could be a big deal. A real big deal. Do you hear something? A sound. Do you hear an unusual sound? Sorry. Do you hear the fucking dog fucking barking? Yes, sir. The dogs aren't usually barking. I heard the dog barking, sir. What the hell are you doing out here? Never, ever leave bone watch. Ever! Get back there now! Sam. Sam! I hate to drag you away from Wheel of Fortune, Sam, but I need you on front watch. No problem. And you two worm farm rejects, get out there and walk the perimeter until dawn. If you hear anything, see anything, shoot it. Kill it. Decimate it. I guess you get what you pay for, huh, Mr. B? Well, I guess I better dock your pay, eh, Goliath? [crickets chirping] Hey? What? Can I ask you a question? What does decimate mean? Buy them the farm. I think. Can I, can I ask you another question? What, dickhead? Does Frank really expect us to shoot people? Do I look like an encyclopedia to you? They're not worried about cops and stuff? I guess not. OK by me. I got to call Deb, OK? She gonna be so psyched that we got a real lead on Bobbi. [music playing] DEB (ON PHONE): Travis, I don't know what to do. A man came over to the house. It was that Cousin guy again, and he had a gun. Oh, god, Travis, I didn't know what to do. Can you please come back? Come back as soon as you can. I'm so scared! Travis! Drive! Look, your sister's in trouble with your trouble, man. We gotta get back now. [deb screaming] Oh, god, you scared me so much! [inaudible] Sis. It's OK. We're here now. What happened? He-- He-- He what? Did he hurt you? No, but he tried! What happened? I, I heard all this yelling from outside, and all this pounding on the door, and it's in bad shape since he just shot it up. Then, then he just kept banging on the door and he said, Where is your brother? I know he's in there. Let me in! And then he ran around to the bedroom window and tried to get in. So I ran and got the gun that you gave me. Did you call Wyatt? Yeah, but he was off-duty. And I don't trust any of these other assholes, and I don't even know the story about what happened between Reb and this guy. And god, the last thing I need to do is get my brother in trouble with the law when you need him so much, Travis. [crying] You're OK. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. OK. God. You guys must was exhausted, huh? Why don't you get some shut eye. I'm, uh, I'm going to go into the office early tomorrow and then I'm going to stay with a friend. I can't stay here anymore. Thanks. You should have seen Travis and the professor tonight. What a show! I'll tell you about that tomorrow. I'm a little tired right now. Yeah. I'm going to get some sleep, too. Good night. Oh! Oh. Travis. It's kind of cramped out there. If you want to crash in my room. I, I've got a big bed, you know, and I don't steal the covers, and I promise, I don't snore. I-- I got a real live lead today. I've got to do some homework. Appreciate the offer, Deb. Thanks. No, thank you for coming so quick. You're my hero, you know? I'm nobody's hero. OK. We take the 62 going east, and then we go to the 405, and we're going to take that south. Is that right, Lonnie? Uh, no. No, it's north. Because it hits at that culvert there and then you go. Hey, Professor, Is this the bay you wanted? It's got all the Tony DeLonghi shit in it. Yeah, I needed that I needed my notebook. Cool, man. Thanks for bringing that by. Yeah, no problem. 555-0666. [phone ringing] Babes in Arms. This is Marion. May I help you please? I'm sorry. I have the wrong number. That's just crazy, isn't it? It will never happen again. Sorry. Grab the phone. I was asleep when Deb left. Call the office. I need to talk to her for a minute, then we need to get out of here. What's the number? 555-0668. 555-0668. You guys, what was the area code we were just at? - Up by Ravina? - Yeah. It's 805, I think. [phone ringing] Babes in Arms. Jesus Christ, I dialed the wrong number. 555-0667. Hurry up-- [phone ringing] --you're missing the show. Babes in Arms Ranch. Fucking good morning to you, too. You guys aren't going to believe this. I know where the hell she's at. - Let's go. - Let's go. Come on! [music playing] All your papers are finally in order. Money has been paid in full. I think it's time to make your dream come true. Here she is. Here's your brand new, squeaky clean, healthy, blue-eyed little girl. Oh, she's so beautiful. Oh, she's perfect! Thank you. Thank you. Oh, hi! [woman crying] Bring her back! Give her back! I already gave you two! I want to keep this one! Let her go! Let me out of here! I want to go get my baby! Stop! You're hurting her! Stop it! You're hurting her! Leave her alone! I'd give you that, too, but I can't risk losing a cash crop. Comprende, little stupid breeding bitch? You've just about fulfilled all of your usefulness you're ever gonna have. I don't think Frank can force himself to ever touch you again. You'd better pray he can close his eyes and think of Miss January, or else you're going to od'ing just like Patrice. So shut the fuck up! I guarantee you after that little light show in the garage, there is no way we're going to be able to get in under daylight, unless we go in at first light. Are you sure this is the place? This is the place. They're watching us right now. [woman crying] [alarm sounding] Chicken shits! Get this place cleaned up now! Get up or he's going to go at you again! You're not pregnant yet. Yet? [crying continues] [horn blowing] Excuse me can we get through here? Nope. We really need to get through here. - Nope. - All right. Let me out. Excuse me I don't think you understand. No, I don't think you understand. Look, J.R-- No, you look. [gunshot] Don't do it! Well, Cowboy, you're going to shoot me, because nothing is going to keep me from going in there and getting my girlfriend out. You mean y'all don't work for them? What do you mean? You don't work for them? That bunch of slime buckets! I wouldn't spit on them if they were all in hell begging for water. You think your girlfriend's in there? Yeah. You think there's a lot of other girls inside there? I think there's a lot of ammunition in there, but-- But what? There's a lot of somebodies in there. How do you know? I hear them. I've even heard them screaming. Will you help us get them out, then? Yep. Can you get us in there? Can y'all ride? Yep. Come on. [hoof beats] That was good. Woo! Aah! Aw, Check that out, eh! [inaudible] Hey, stop this! [inaudible] Well looks like we're going to have to find another alternative. Hey, man, that's where I come in. You are walking perimeter at 4:00 AM. I got phone watch. Right. You don't want to walk the perimeter at night because you're so fucking lazy! You don't believe me? Ask Sam. Right. You want me to wake up Sam the Monster Man and ask him a dumb question for you? You are such a fucking wuss, and you're the reason we don't have no beer no more. Riding Riding the range. [inaudible] all day for little or no pay. Oh, well, well, well. If it isn't Dale Evans. Howdy. Hi, you fellers. Long time, no see. Don't y'all ever have no nights off? Don't y'all ever have any fun? Look what I got. Hoo, hoo-wee! Couple of hits off this joy juice, I don't care how long we're on watch or what time we get off. Well, neighbors, I like to be neighborly and all, but don't drink it all. Save some for your good neighbor here. That won't be necessary. Tell him why. Tell our good neighbor why. Why? Why? Why? Because when we finish off that bottle, we got to shoot you. [laughter] I HEAR A dog barking. We know why. [dog barking] Why? Yeah, we gonna shoot him. [laughter] [suspenseful music playing] [dog barking] [dog barking] Can I [inaudible] What are you looking at? Nothing. [nervous laughter] Get in your room. Get in your room! [suspenseful music playing] [drunken laughter] [gunshots] Hey! Get around the side of the house. Jeff! Jeff! Where were you? Follow that guy! Follow him! [gunshots] [women screaming] Come on! This way! Boom! [explosion] Come on! [explosion] [gunshots] [explosion] [phone ringing] Shit! No answer? [explosion] [sounds of fighting] [gunshot] Get in the truck! It's OK. Get in the truck! [gunshots] [explosion] Stay down now. [women screaming] [gunshots] Goodbye, my friends. [explosion] Travis! [explosion] Hey, [inaudible] Don't go back in! Don't go back in there! I've got to get Bobbi out! Bobbi! [inaudible] Get to the phone! Get to the phone! Go! I'll be right back. Stop! [gunshot] [inaudible] Hey! Did you shoot that girl in the arm? [crying in pain] [gunshot] [women screaming] I'm going to get you out of here. Mama will get you out of this bad place. I'll drive. Wait! We've got to go back and get Jackie and Lisa and the baby. Baby? Where are they? Right in the front bedroom. I'll take these girls out of here. I'll be back. - All right. Go! [gunshot] [gunshots] [glass breaking] [baby crying] Shit! [gunshots] [baby crying] Damn it! Travis. Travis! Shit! Come on! OK. Go! [gunshots] Bob. Get Bobbi. Bobbi! Travis! I knew you were alive! The baby's coming! Get me out of here! It's OK. It's OK. It's OK [inaudible] [gunshots] Come on. Let's get the hell out of here. Oh my god! [gunshot] [explosion] Debbie? Deb? You should have given up on her. A little more time, a few more disappointments and dead ends, you would have forgotten all about Little Miss Princess here. Then you and I, Travis-- She watched while Frank raped every single one of those girls. No! But not Little Miss Queenie here, huh? You see, Travis, that wasn't necessary. Because the little princess was already PG when we picked her up during your little play honeymoon. What? That's right. Your little darling was already pregnant and was too chickenshit to tell you about it. She thought she'd lose you. That you wouldn't want it, Mr. Independence. Bobbi told me she was going to get an abortion and never tell you about it. Do you have any idea how beautiful that baby will be? Do you? The child of Princess Bobbi and our handsome hero, Travis? Hey, Frank! Come here, Frank. Deb. I didn't want to believe that you'd lie to me. [gunshot] Wyatt? I never trusted that Firkin girl as far as I could dropkick a typewriter. - You followed her? - I followed you. [dramatic music playing] BOBBI: Oh, God! [gunshots] - Loch? - Get the hell out of here! Go! Loch. Don't call me that, man. You know, you never did tell anybody how I got that name. No, I swear. Oh, god. I never told anybody, Loch. That was the only secret I ever kept in my life. [gunshots] What about the other girls? Suicide got them all out. And Reb? Reb's going to be OK. We're going to be OK. [upbeat music playing]
