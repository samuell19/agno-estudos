[♪♪] WOMAN: Hannah? Hannah! Hannah! [♪♪] [PANTING] [SIRENS WAILING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING OVER POLICE RADIO] CONLON: The, uh, kid's name's Hannah. Hannah Overton. JACK: How old? Eight. How long's she been missing? About four hours. Who saw her last? Apparently, the grandfather. She was, uh, just riding her bike. What, no cars, no strangers? No, sir. No, kid just vanished. What about the parents? A bit of a domestic situation. The dad has custody. Maternal grandparents get to see the kid every couple of weeks, just for a weekend. Where's the mother? Dead. But it's all natural causes. According to the grandparents, the kid would-- Hannah. CONLON: Yeah, right. Hannah. Would sometimes rather hide than have to go back with her dad. So the kid could be hiding? Or she could be lost. Look, how do you wanna handle this, sir? Abduction. If it turns out she's hiding in the bush, she gets her backside smacked and we all get to go home. I told him to wait. REPORTER 1: Excuse me. Are you a member of the family? REPORTER 2: Excuse me, sir. Are you a friend or relative? Is there anything you can tell us about the girl? I'm Hannah's father. CONSTABLE: Let him go. What have you done with her? David! Where is she? Don't you dare come in this house! David! David! Let go! I know what you're trying to do! You're not gonna get away with it! Break it up! What have you done with her? We know all about you! Get him out! CONLON: That's enough! [PANTING] Well, I'm here to find a missing child, not settle some family dispute. You the father? They know where she is. Get him out of here. If you wanna find Hannah, ask her. BARBARA: It's all an act! He did it! He's taken her. It's all an act. I don't want him in my house! Mr. Thomas, let's just sit down and calm down, shall we? All right? CONLON: Ray. Let's just all settle. I'm Detective Inspector Jack Maitland. What makes you think Hannah's father has something to do with her disappearance? Because of what he has been doing to her. And what would that be? Hannah is in tears every time she has to go back with him. What do you think he's been doing to her? Do you know anything about this? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Well, anything to it? Look, we got a sworn affidavit from a Libby Gleeson. She's not local, but she reckons she saw David hitting the kid at the swimming pool. You think I might like to have known that? This woman, this, uh, Gleeson, do you believe she saw something? I don't know, sir. It's possible. All right. Find her. Bring her down here. This custody thing sounds like a mess. Well, most of them are. Run a check on anyone within a 50-kilometer radius who's ever looked sideways at a kid before. Just in case this is a genuine abduction. Yeah. Right. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] Which one do you want? Her. Bad luck. When Linda died, Hannah was only 4 years old. We raised her. She's our child. She's always been our child. She always will be. Hannah's special. Of course, everyone thinks that of their grandchildren. But it's been different for us. You could see how happy Hannah is when she's with us. He doesn't deserve to be her father. I'm sorry, but I have to ask, Mrs. Thomas. Did you have anything to do with Hannah's disappearance? No, I did not. Don't listen to anything he tells you. Hannah's father is evil. [♪♪] Get lost! She's very pretty. [SIGHS] Any other kids? Just Hannah. Mrs. Thomas said Hannah would sometimes hide rather than go home with you. That's a lie. Anything Barbara tells you about me is a lie. Well, what about Libby Gleeson? Is she a liar too? JACK: How long has this abuse been going on? Since he got custody. Did you report it? Of course. But no one did anything. They just let it go on and on. I knew this would happen. I've dreaded this day. Hannah's never hidden, never been upset about leaving her grandmother's and going home with you? I've picked her up and she's been in tears. Why? Because of the things Barbara's told her. That I didn't love her. That I was gonna give her away. She couldn't stand me having her. None of them could. She took Hannah. It's her. Do you have any proof? I don't need proof! You might not, Mr. Overton, but we do. You have got no idea what she's like... what she's capable of-- The things that she can do. [SIGHS] You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. [SIGHS] Mr. Overton. She's a witch. Barbara's a witch. A witch? Usually he just calls me a bitch. He's just trying to mislead you. Hannah isn't lost. She hasn't been taken by a stranger or a witch on a broomstick. Why would he take her, Mrs. Thomas, when he already has custody? He's an intensely jealous man, inspector. He hated Hannah coming up here. More than once, he came and got her before he was supposed to. I think he came here and he took her. He's done something to her. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [REPORTERS CHATTERING] CONSTABLE: Stand back. Stand back, please! [REPORTERS CLAMORING] [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] You ever met a witch? Not that I know of. Me neither. But she sure doesn't like him. Well, maybe with good reason. ROGER: Maitland, you can tell me. JACK: Not this time, Roger. JENNY: What about her husband? He looks like the sort of guy who does what he's told. Police, emergency service volunteers and local residents from this close-knit community have joined in to help the search for the missing 8-year-old who disappeared from her grandmother's home while... REPORTER 1: ...the town of Whitley, where the search for Hannah Overton continues. Hannah was... REPORTER 2: Members of police and emergency service personnel and local volunteers are combing nearby bushland for the 8-year-old, whose bicycle was found on the roadside. REPORTER 3: They have not ruled out the possibility that Hannah may have wandered off and got lost. They fear she may have been abducted. [BARKING] [BELL RINGING] [TRAIN HORN BLOWS] [♪♪] LINDA: David. DAVID: Where's Hannah? LINDA: You're not supposed to be here. DAVID: Where is Hannah? LINDA: Access isn't until next week. DAVID: I heard you're leaving. LINDA: Who told you that? DAVID: So it's true, then. [BABY CRYING] LINDA: Why would we wanna leave? DAVID: I won't let you do this. You don't own her, Linda, and neither does your mother. LINDA: Wait! David! HANNAH: Please. Please, please, Daddy. [POUNDING ON DOOR] DAVID: Linda, open the door! Open the bloody door. BARBARA: Hannah's gonna grow away from you, David. [ECHOES] You're an absent father. LIBBY: I know what I saw. Sometimes people make mistakes, Miss Gleeson. They see what they wanna see. He was as close as you are. I didn't imagine it. I saw him hit her. It was hard enough to make her cry. You're not from around here, are you? I was visiting friends. Barbara Thomas? I met her through a mutual friend. I stayed there once. That's when I saw him hit her. Did Barbara Thomas tell you David was physically abusing Hannah? Yes, she did. Was it before you swore the affidavit or after? It was before. Before this incident you claim you saw. No, it was after the pool incident. That's when she told me it wasn't the first time. Look... just because we talked about it doesn't change what I saw. A violent man hitting an innocent child. Ta. Who do you believe, Jack? I think it's too early to believe any of them. Thought you would've learnt that. [OFFICERS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] You don't think this guy loves his daughter? Maybe he loves her too much. Excuse me, Jack. I just spoke to one of the locals, a bloke named Bernie Reid. He said he stopped by to see David this afternoon, only David wasn't home. Went back half an hour later, David still wasn't home. Maybe he didn't want to see the guy? Oh, no, Bernie owed him money. Went round there to pay him. Wouldn't you open the door if you were home? Think he got any sleep? Would you? [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIO] Good morning. You found Hannah? No, no news. Sorry. JACK: We'd like to talk to you, David. Mr. Overton? [DOLL CRIES] It's Hannah's. It's a game she played. Um, can I offer you something? Not for me. No, I'm fine, thanks. It was a bad night. Well, there's a couple of things we need to clear up, David. Sure. When exactly did you last see Hannah? Before lunch, when I dropped her off. And after you dropped her off, you came back here? I've told you all this. JACK: Did you go out again? No. You sure? Yeah. No. I went out for a run. I forgot. Away long? About an hour. Anyone see you? Why do you wanna know if I went out? I run in the bush. No one saw me. What do I have to say to make you people believe me? It's Barbara! You don't know her. You don't know what she's like. People do things for her. It's like she's got some kind of power over them. JACK: She doesn't have power over you, though, does she, David? So let's get back to Hannah. This is about Hannah. It's always been about Hannah, right from the start. You should be looking for her. How well do you know Libby Gleeson? Libby Gleeson made a mistake. It didn't happen. She says it did. This has got nothing to do with Libby Gleeson. It's Barbara. She should be locked up for all this sick witchcraft stuff. We need proof, David. You want proof? Ask Barbara about the witchcraft. Ask her about the stone circle behind her house. Kind of prickly. What'd you expect, a confession? His daughter's missing, he's having a teddy bear's picnic and it's the grandmother who's crazy. Well, people do weird things. Yeah, especially weird people. [♪♪] [ROOSTER CROWS] JACK: You didn't tell us Libby Gleeson was a close friend. Libby's not a close friend. She's more of an acquaintance, really. When we contested custody the last time, she signed an affidavit saying she'd seen David hitting Hannah. Well, did you ever see anything like that? Linda said David would drink... and then he would do things. Unspeakable things. The next day he'd have no recollection of what he'd done. He wasn't always like that. In the beginning, he was the perfect son-in-law. We all got on so well. Linda was so happy. We were all so happy. Ah, you-- [LINDA GIGGLING] DAVID [PLAYFULLY]: You are dead! You are dead! No! [BOTH LAUGHING] [ALL LAUGHING] JACK: Mrs. Thomas? Yeah. When did it stop? When Hannah was born. Nice pony. Hannah's. That's why we moved here. Linda loved horses too. It kept her... Happy? Sane. The stone circle in the paddock, you use that for anything? When we have friends to visit, we have a campfire. The stones are there to stop the fire from spreading. I'm sorry, it's not as sinister as I'm sure David made out. Mom? Some reporter guy on the phone wants to talk to you. This is my son, Craig. Hi. JACK: Craig. Hi. You want to talk to him? I'll take it. Could you excuse me? Mrs. Thomas? You didn't ask if there was any news. Well, I'm sure you would tell me if there was. [♪♪] JENNY: Feel anything? Yeah. Crazy we're even standing out here. [CHUCKLES] [CLICKING TONGUE] Here, boy. Come on. Here, boy. [CLICKS TONGUE] Come on. Horsey. Here, horsey. Here. Horses don't like fire. So, what's he done with Hannah? He came back early. She didn't wanna go with him. So he hit her. [CELL PHONE RINGING] [PHONE BEEPS ON] Yeah, Maitland. Where? All right, we'll be there. They've found something. [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIO] [SIREN WAILING] [SIREN SHUTS OFF] [♪♪] That's Hannah's. Where does this road lead? Into the forest. But she's not in there. She... She wanted you to find it, can't you see? She probably got Ray to dump it out here. That's what she wants. The longer you spend out here looking for her, the farther away Hannah gets. You think I could ki--? You think I could hurt my own daughter? See, people do things. They can't explain it later, can't even remember doing it. Maybe it's like that. That-- That didn't happen! Then why don't you tell me how it did happen, David? Barbara made me feel like I was part of the family. But it soon got like there were three of us in the marriage. Did you resent Barbara for being close to her daughter? It was Barbara who resented me. She resented the fact that Linda loved me. She... She always did love me. Even when things got bad. And she took everything from me, but not that. She couldn't take that. [♪♪] You stay in bed any longer, and I'm gonna have to come in here and get you. Five more minutes. Your five minutes, it's more like five hours. [LAUGHING] David. No! All right. You win. Yeah. [GIGGLES] [LAUGHS] [GRUNTING] JACK: How did Linda get on with her mother? Um, Barbara dominated her. Barbara dominates everyone. I told her to stand up to her, but she never would. Barbara just wore her down. Linda, open the door. [DAVID GRUNTS] [♪♪] Linda? Linda? I only just got her to the hospital in time. But Barbara blamed me. Why? Because I wanted her to stop being her mother's daughter and start being my wife. That's something you argued about? Including the night she tried to kill herself? Yeah. Then maybe Barbara had every right to blame you. It wasn't like that! BARBARA: Oh, some tea. Tea, David? DAVID: After Hannah was born, Linda and I were so happy. [BABY CRYING] Oh, yes! Then things began to change. Oh, no. Barbara took my daughter. Oh, who's a good girl? She stole my family. [BABY WAILING] BARBARA: Just let me do it. LINDA: Mom, I can manage. Oh, my God, you're struggling. Let me do it. Please, Mom. Let me do it. What is going on? Nothing to worry about. Oh! Just a little misunderstanding. [SLAMS] Okay, shush. Yes, yes. What did you say to her? Nothing, David. She's just tired, that's all. It's very common. She's not getting enough sleep. [SOFTLY] Oh, yes. Hannah's gonna sleep in our room from now on. Aren't you, Hannah? Is that a good idea? I mean, she should be with us. David, we need to take care of Linda's health. She needs rest. And understanding. [WHISPERING] Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Are you okay? I'm fine. [SNIFFS] [SIGHS] You really want Hannah to sleep in your mom's room? Mom says it's a good idea. Well, what do you think? I'm not a good mother. What? Who told you that? You're a great mom. [SIGHS] What would you know about it, David? Maybe it wasn't such a good idea we moved in here. I like it here. This is where I grew up. Is this where you want Hannah to grow up? I'm tired, David. I need to sleep. Come on. Let's go to bed. Come on. Stop it. [♪♪] [DAVID SIGHS] Barbara? Is Hannah okay? She's just gone to sleep, David. I... I don't think this is such a good idea. Perhaps you haven't noticed, but Linda is exhausted. I can take care of Hannah. So can I. Ray needs you in the yard. You will respect our privacy. Of course. Then everything's going to be fine. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] Yes, David? I'm worried about Linda. I reckon she's got postnatal depression and... Well, maybe she should be seeing someone, after what happened last time. Linda's fine. She's just tired. [BABY CRYING] I'll take her. It's all right. She'll settle down. [BABY COUGHS SOFTLY, THEN STOPS CRYING] Was there something else, David? No. You must've been pretty angry with Barbara taking Hannah away like that. It must've been tough for you and Linda, staying in the house. I tried to make it work. But things only got worse. Then when Hannah was about 6 months old, I realized had to get her and Linda out of there. I had to get them away from Barbara. [LINDA SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [HANNAH EXCLAIMS] LINDA: Yummy. Yummy. Hey. LINDA: Look how happy she is. You look pretty happy too. I am. It's been a long time. Things are getting better. Are they? Listen, why... Why don't we go away for a couple of days? Rent a house at the beach or something? That'd be fun. Yeah. Mom loves the beach. Just us. [♪♪] Now? Yeah. Why not? Come on. Want to go to the beach? I just gotta see-- Linda. You don't have to ask anybody's permission. If we wanna do something, we just go. We need to pack. No... I already have. Come on. [SIGHING] Okay. DAVID [SINGSONG]: We're going to the beach. We're going to the beach. We're going to the beach. [HANNAH COOS] Where's the bag? I got Craig to put your bag in the car, David. Thanks. Uh, we're just going away for a couple of days. You could do with a little rest. I'll take care of Hannah. Hannah's coming with us. What's all this about? BARBARA: David's going away. Are you going or staying, Linda? She's going. Linda? I'm... I'm staying. I'll take Hannah. Perhaps it's best for everyone, David... if you just go. Let's not make this any more unpleasant than it's already been. I'll fight this. I'm gonna tell everyone who you are. I'm just a grandmother who wants what's best for her granddaughter, that's all. Mmm! [BARBARA KISSES] [RATTLE RATTLING AND HANNAH GIGGLING] [GROANING] She put them up to it. JENNY: Did you go to the police? No. Now, why doesn't that surprise me? I thought I'd be able to sort it out. So far, we only have your word this assault ever took place. It's your word against hers. He's lying. It didn't happen like that. You didn't ask him to leave? Yes. It was obvious their marriage was over. Only David couldn't see it. Linda wasn't coping. She was suffering. Hannah was suffering. I could see it was just a matter of time before he hurt one of them. [HANNAH CRYING] Shut her up. Shut up, Hannah! Will you shut up? I can manage. Do something about it! Just shut her up! Let me take her. Shut her up, will you? God! David, you're scaring her. You're the one who's bloody scaring her 'cause you're bloody hopeless. [SHATTERS] [WHIMPERS] [SIGHS] It didn't hurt her to sleep in my room away from all that. Do you have children, inspector? Yes. If it was your daughter, your grandchild, tell me you wouldn't do the same thing to protect her? He says your husband and your son attacked him. I was the one who attacked. [♪♪] Please. Thank you. DAVID: You listen to me. [BARBARA GASPS] I'll be back. Hannah's mine. RAY: That's enough, David. [CRYING SOFTLY] [RAY GROANS] Did he come back? He got access rights after the divorce. It helped no one at the time. And then we moved... and he stopped coming to see Hannah. And now it's come to this. David didn't turn up again until after Linda had died. How long was that? Oh, nearly three years. He's not exactly your doting dad, is he? Maybe he had his reasons. For disappearing? Or for turning up? JENNY: She wasn't abducted. We both know she's not lost. So that only leaves... One of them's lying. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] What is it, Craig? You okay, Mom? I'm missing Hannah. So... I saw that bastard today. He drove right past our house. He's gonna get what he deserves one day. I hope so. JENNY: May I come in? DAVID: Are you working? JENNY: Something like this, you never really stop. [DAVID SNIFFS] Does Maitland ever stop? I've never seen it. Send you along to play good cop, did he? No. He thinks it's me. He thinks I did it. I'm sorry he's like that. He can be kind of intimidating. Do you believe I did it? I don't know. You don't believe a word I tell you. Some things are hard to believe. Oh, witches? Yeah. How anybody can believe in that sort of stuff-- People seriously believe in the virgin birth. and that Christ ascended into heaven on a cloud. That's pretty weird. I guess everyone believes something. Yeah, well, I didn't want to believe it. What made you change your mind? She never let me into her room. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [RINGING CONTINUOUS] [SIGHS] Hello? [DOOR OPENS] Who? No, you've got the wrong number. [SCOFFS] Sorry. God. BARBARA: Who was it? Oh, wrong number. Who did they want? Oh, I don't know. Um, some woman. Jessie Rylah. You know her? Never heard of her. [DOOR CLOSES] BARBARA: Good! Yellow. Blue. Blue! Oh, blue! Yes, blue. Put that one in there. Put that one... This one. This one. [BARBARA EXCLAIMS, LAUGHING] [ENGINE REVVING] Hey. Hey. You ever heard of Jessie Rylah? No. Do you think this needs lemon peel? I hate lemon peel. Okay. [HANNAH BABBLING] BARBARA: Yes. Clever girl. Oh, you're a clever girl. Cordial time, Hannah. Oh! Who's a clever girl? Yes. Yummy! [♪♪] Yes! Thank you. [SNIFFS] Jessie Rylah. [THUNDER CRASHES] Strawberry. Where's David? He was in the kitchen before. He's coming out. Craig. Where's David? I don't know. I'll go and have a look. [DOOR CLOSES] CRAIG: David? David. David? [♪♪] David? [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] Anything for me? Why would anyone write to you, Craig? DAVID: Jessie Rylah writes books about the occult. Barbara Thomas is Jessie Rylah. Doesn't make her a witch. You don't believe me. I need something. Some proof. I think you better go now. I want to believe-- No, you don't. You wanna believe her and Libby Gleeson and everyone else before you believe me. [♪♪] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [GIRL PANTING] [DOOR CREAKS] [♪♪] They were either bruises or not. They were bruises. I didn't think it was worth mentioning. Why not? Because it was Barbara Thomas complaining again. Jack, the thing is, kids play hard, you know? They get bruises. Did Hannah say how she got 'em? She didn't want to tell but said she couldn't remember. Oh, inspector, press. Line two. [SIGHS] Do you know where Libby Gleeson works? Yeah, she's got a bookstore. What sort of bookstore? Some hippie thing. The Secret Knowledge. [CLEARS THROAT] [♪♪] [BELLS JINGLING FAINTLY] Sell much of this stuff? Enough. Any books on witchcraft? Middle shelf. You're interested in the occult? I'm interested in all sorts of things. Is that how you met Barbara Thomas? Through a shared interest in the occult? I told you, I met her through a friend. What about Ray? We could talk to him again. Ray's only gonna tell us what Barbara wants us to hear. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] Oh, God. CONSTABLE: Thank you. Move back. REPORTER: Jack, Jack! Detective, is there any news? Come on, guys. You know how this works. You believe Hannah knew her abductor? JACK: It's an ongoing investigation. Is the father a suspect? It's a police matter. If you'll just give us space. Are you confident the little girl's still alive? Absolutely. [SOFTLY] Hi. REPORTER: Oh, great. JENNY: Good morning, Mrs. Thomas. Did you tell them that you suspect David? Do I? You could get yourself into a lot of trouble making accusations you can't prove. What more proof do you need? Well, more than I've got. Mrs. Thomas, do you mind if I have a look around? No, go right ahead. Thanks. [♪♪] Scare you? No. Hannah's room. Where she comes to get away from him. You don't like him. No. Neither would you if you stood here and listened to her cry. Sometimes she'd cry for hours. He's got you all fooled. He's the one that took her. He took her and he killed her, and you can't even see it. You're useless. Why didn't you tell us you wrote books on the occult? Because it has nothing to do with him taking Hannah. David doesn't seem to think so. I'm a writer, inspector. Amongst other things, I write books about Celtic folklore. Witchcraft. It makes me such an easy target, doesn't it? It plays to people's prejudices and ignorance. All David has to do is mention the occult and instantly I'm under suspicion. It doesn't matter what I tell you... how loudly I protest, how vehemently I deny it. You can't help thinking, "What if he's right? What if she is a witch?" Are you? No, I'm not. JENNY: Inspector. What is it? What have you found? What's this? Oh, it's one of my workbooks. And you made these notes? Research for a book I'm writing. What sort of book? Oh, it's about the spirit world. Making contact. Séances, past lives... More proof that I'm an evil woman, inspector. May we take these, Mrs. Thomas? Yes, take what you like. Don't be fooled by him. Don't be fooled by his twisted version of the truth. DAVID: Everything she says is a lie. Where did you go when they threw you out? I stayed in a... Some dump for a couple of weeks, and then I moved in with a mate. How did they treat you when you eventually got access? Like a leper. [BELL RINGING] [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] Everyone except Hannah. She called me Daddy. Not at first. Um, it took a while. I had to work at it. It started to mean something to her. What did they think of that? Not much. [SWING SQUEAKING] DAVID: Whoa! Higher, Daddy. Higher! Higher? All right. Higher. Okay. Big one. [BOTH EXCLAIM] This is fun, Daddy! [LAUGHING] [GIGGLING] [DAVID GRUNTS] Higher, Dad! Look at me, Mom! [GIGGLING] He has to go now, Hannah. Not "he." Daddy. David has to go now. I don't want him to go. Sweetie, come on. You'll see him again. I don't want him to go. Why does he always have to go? [SUCKS TEETH] Come on, don't be sad. I don't want him to go. I don't want to go either. Can he please, please, please stay? [SNIFFLES] I can't, Hannah. I've gotta go. Sweetie. Please, please, please, Mom? Please. I miss you. I really don't want you to go, Dad. Hannah, story time. Linda. [SNIFFLING] Off you go, Hann. You gotta go. [SOBBING] No. No. No! No! No! Shh, don't cry, baby. No! Shh! No! No! LINDA: Come on, let's go. You will never stop her loving me. Hannah's gonna grow away from you, David. You're an absent father. I was talking about Linda. DAVID: Someone in town told me they were leaving. I went straight out there. LINDA: David. Where's Hannah? You're not supposed to be here. Where's Hannah? Access isn't until next week. I heard you're leaving. Who told you that? So it's true then? Why would we wanna leave? Don't do this to me, Linda. I won't let you do this. You don't own her, and neither does your mother. Wait. Hannah? David, wait. Hannah? Please, David. [SIGHS] I'll go and get her. I will go and get her, David. [DOOR CLOSES] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] HANNAH: Daddy! Daddy! [♪♪] Hannah? Hannah! No! Daddy. Hannah! Hannah! Daddy! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Daddy! Hannah! Hannah! [ENGINE REVVING] [BELL RINGING] Come on! [TIRES SCREECHING] [TRAIN HORN BLOWS] [TRAIN HORN BLOWS] [TIRES SCREECHING] JENNY: David. What happened then? DAVID: I went back. [♪♪] Someone phoned me once and told me they moved back to England. That's when I stopped looking. It was only when Linda died that I found out they were still here. How did she die? A cerebral hemorrhage. If everything you say is true... why would Barbara do these things? The craft is handed down from mother to daughter. Hannah's next. It's all there, Jack. All the pieces, they fit. And every piece is circumstantial evidence. It's not enough. We need proof. Excuse me, Jack. Ahem, I think you might want to hear this. The bloke's name's Bill Young. Okay, Bill, I'd like you to tell Detective Inspector Maitland what you just told me. I had to move some sheep Saturday afternoon. I've got a couple of paddocks down the Newbury Road. What time was this? About a quarter to 1. Before Hannah went missing? It wasn't later, because I went home for lunch afterwards. Anyway, I saw Ray Thomas' car heading out towards Newbury. You sure it was his car? At first I was sure. Then I saw the driver, and I thought it must've been a car just like Ray's. Ray wasn't driving it? Some young bloke. Didn't think any more about it till I saw the news on TV at lunchtime. They were interviewing Ray's son. I reckon it could've been him. Craig? Yeah. It wasn't me. I wasn't there. I told you, I didn't get back here until after she disappeared. Then you'll be able to tell us who you were with, who you saw, who you spoke to. I wasn't with anyone, I didn't see anyone, I didn't speak to anyone. I was home alone. You didn't go out? Nope. Busted up with my girlfriend. I really didn't feel like it. You don't have an alibi. I don't need one because I wasn't there. Ask my mother. She'll tell you. You don't think much of Hannah's father, do you? No. He's been abusing her since she was a baby. Is that why you tried to kill him? That's a lie. So he was lying too? Just like the farmer who saw you driving? That wasn't me! How do you know David was assaulting Hannah? We just knew. What, you saw it? No, but I knew. How? I just knew! Your mother told you? Yes! [♪♪] JACK: Uh-huh. Yeah. We've scaled the search back, but we still have searchers in the area. What I need now is surveillance teams. That's right. Jack. You wanted proof? Yeah, right, I'll call you back. It didn't make sense at first. It's like random letters all jumbled about. Do you know what an Ouija board is? You ask a question, the answer is spelt out on the board. She's been using one, Jack. And this is where she wrote down the answers. Look at this date. Less than a month ago. Do we know what questions were asked? Not all of them. But look at this: "They will suspect, but they will prove nothing." And this one. "She'll be safe with our friends in the city." And I found this tucked in the back of a book, a quote from a removal company. She got it two weeks ago. They're moving, Jack. Still not proof enough. It's her handwriting. This proves she was planning it weeks ago. Okay. We'll bring her in. REPORTER: Mrs. Thomas, do you know where Hannah is being held? Get out of our way. Back off! Move! There's been talk of the occult? Excuse us. Is your family involved in witchcraft? Good gracious, no. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] Did you plan Hannah's abduction? No, I did not! This whole thing is turning into a witch hunt. It's been said you're involved in witchcraft. I don't care what they say about me. I do care about my granddaughter. She's the one who's suffered and she's suffering still. Are the police treating you as a suspect? The police should stop persecuting me and... [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] ...try and find her. Excuse me. Is Hannah's father involved? Why don't you ask him that? Are you under arrest, or are you going of your own free will? REPORTER: Go and get a shot there. [REPORTERS CONTINUE CLAMORING] JACK: You tell us you don't practice witchcraft, and then we find you've written books on the subject. Well, I'm confused. Which is it, Mrs. Thomas? You don't have to be a mother to write books about motherhood. I don't know why you're wasting your time on all this. Tell me about all this. It's just research, that's all. Research into what? Communication with the spirit world. So "they'll suspect but prove nothing." That's just research, is it? I don't remember writing this. Come on, it's your handwriting. When I used the Ouija board, I went into-- I suppose you could call it a trance. Maybe it refers to your concerns about Hannah's abduction? Hannah hadn't been abducted when I wrote that. I thought you didn't remember. You just told me I wrote that. Intriguing, isn't it? So you contacted the spirit world for guidance? It was just research. Because you were planning to abduct your grandchild? That is not true. Well, what about this then? "She'll be safe with our friends in the city." I don't know what this means. Who are your friends in the city? [CHUCKLES] Well, I have friends everywhere, including the city. I'm sure you have friends everywhere, inspector. Is that where Hannah is, safe with friends in the city? No. Is she safe with other friends? I don't know where she is. You should be asking her father these questions. Ask him why his own daughter is scared to go home with him. I'm asking you, Mrs. Thomas. Where's Hannah? And I'm telling you, inspector. I don't know. You believed her. [ENGINE STARTS] She's gonna get away with it. She's got friends all over the country. Any time you get close, they're gonna pass Hannah on. Witchcraft is a woman's thing, you know that, Jack? You're welcome to it. It's handed down. It's all in her book. The role of the man is to provide seed for the woman child. Once the woman child's been conceived, the man is no longer needed. Typical. She only wanted David for his seed. Jack, it fits. It only fits if you buy all this witchcraft stuff. Look, I wanna lock her up, not burn her at the stake. If she is a witch, she would've passed the craft onto Linda. Linda would've passed it on to Hannah. Only Linda died. Thanks, mate. Barbara Thomas is obsessive and she's manipulative. But this has got nothing to do with witchcraft. It's a theory. It's a fairy tale. [FLOORBOARDS CREAK] What is it, Craig? You know it's his fault. Yes. So we should do something. We are doing something. I could pay him a visit. No. He's gonna get away with this, Mom. Is he, Craig? [♪♪] [GROANING SOFTLY, SNIFFING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello? MAN [ON PHONE]: You'll never see her again, bastard. You're never gonna get her back. [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [TROLLEY BELL RINGS] Do you, uh... Do you like gardening? I can take it or leave it. You Craig? Yeah. Stephan? Yeah. I hear you've got a little problem you'd like sorted out. Maybe. You done this sort of work before? Yeah. Once or twice. They, uh... They went okay? I'm still here. Hmm. You wanna learn to relax there, Craig. Nerves can be very damaging for your health. Um, how much is this gonna cost? Oh, that depends on who it is, how you want it done, how hard it is. Different jobs, different prices. It'll be easy. He's my brother-in-law. My ex-brother-in-law. Oh, he will be... when I'm done. You want it permanent, right? Yeah. Just as long as you make it look like an accident. Accidents are no problem. I need some details. Yeah, I got some. [SIGHS] Can you do him? Sure, I can do him. [♪♪] We're only targeting the grandmother and the grandfather. If they move, I want to know where. If they talk to someone, I want to know who. Now, it's not gonna be an easy surveillance. You're in the country and you're not local. People are gonna notice, because out here, they do. We're operating out of this office. If you can't get me, talk to Jen. If you can't get Jen, you talk to Conlon. Craig Thomas is shaping up to be a bit of a loose cannon, so I want you to keep your distance. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [ENGINE STARTS] [PHONE LINE RINGING] BARBARA [OVER HEADPHONES]: Glenda? Barbara Thomas. GLENDA: Oh, Barbara, I was just thinking about you. Any news on poor little Hannah? BARBARA: No, nothing at all. Police say they're still looking, but... GLENDA: It must be terrible for you. I won't be able to make the school meeting. Could you tell the committee, give them any apologies? All we can do is hope. Thank you, Glenda, for your support. Thank you. Bye. [LINE CLICKS, DIAL TONE CRACKLING] [MOUTHS WORDS] [HANGS UP] Someone was listening. Another crossed line. No. It wasn't an open line. It was something else. We're supposed to call tonight. Not from here. Phones make all sorts of noises. The older the exchange, the worse they are. I'll write a letter. He'll get it tomorrow or the day after. You could call him from a phone box in town. [WHISPERS] Yes. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning. [SIGHS] REPORTER: And in other news, the nationwide hunt for 8-year-old Hannah Overton enters its fifth day with police still no closer to finding... JENNY: Thanks. Hi, Stuart. Any news? I was hoping you might have something for me. [SIGHS] It's going cold. She's slipping away from us. We're not getting this all wrong, are we? Late to be having doubts, Jack. It's never too late. [♪♪] [BRAKES SQUEAL] [TELEPHONE RINGING] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Peter's losing his nerve. He wants to move her. Let's go. Jack. One of the surveillance units retrieved a letter discarded by Barbara this morning. Where from? What is it? Yesterday's date on the letter. JACK: Try this piece here. No, this one. Something, something... "traveling in two weeks' time to collect the package or you'll be contacted with a forwarding address." Hannah. JACK: Bayview Road? I think we just found her. [♪♪] Oh! Don't give up on me now, Ray. Don't forget why we're doing this. I don't think I can... Can do this anymore. I... Yes, you can. You can. David, we think we've found Hannah. [PHONE DIALING] Craig, Stephan. Time to talk. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Colin Pierce. Jack Maitland. As soon as we got your call, we put the house under obs. No one's come out. No one's gone in. It's your operation. How do you want to play this? All right. Let's not complicate things. We'll go in the front door, you guys can cover the back. [♪♪] It's the police. [DOOR CREAKS] Hello? It's the police. Police. Police. Hello? [SIGHS SOFTLY] [PANTING] Another empty house. JACK: Let's see who he called last. Train information. [♪♪] The railway station. [SIRENS WAILING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Victoria Police, mate. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] I'm sorry. There they are! Hannah. What do you think you're doing? That's my daughter. Put her down. Who do you think you are anyway? I said, put her down. I'm sorry. We're looking for someone else. I'm sorry. Hannah! Hannah! Daddy! Hannah! Let go! Hannah! Daddy! Let me go! Hannah! [♪♪] Daddy! Let me look at you. [PANTING] Did he hurt you? No. I love you, Daddy. I missed you. Are you okay? HANNAH: Yes. STEPHAN: Mr. Overton? Detective Sergeant Kosgo, Covert Intelligence Unit. I think you owe me a beer. [CHUCKLES] G'day, Stephan. STEPHAN: Jack.

Maybe later. Hey, Jack, you should read a book. JACK: Yeah, one day. No, it might change your mind about witchcraft. Sure it will. Seriously. It's all there. Everything you always wanted to know. Yeah, right. The guy got his kid back. That's all that matters. [GIRL SCREAMS] Hannah? Hannah! Oh, God! Oh, are you hurt? [♪♪] [♪♪]
