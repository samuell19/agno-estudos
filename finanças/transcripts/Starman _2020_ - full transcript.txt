This is me, Luca Parmitano, as a child. Flying has always been my passion. SICILY, ITALY I think we all desire what we see. I grew up with cartoons, American ones, but especially Japanese about space, robots and great explorations in this accessible universe. While in the real world, the first Space Shuttle missions were being broadcast on TV. Time! One of my earliest memories is being asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, and, as a child, I said: an astronaut. I said it with the same spirit a child today says: Superman or Batman. It was the same idea. But that idea of a job that is unique, wonderful, fun, adventuresome, has stayed with me all my life. As years passed, I became more humble, modest, but at present I am the only Italian who has walked in space, the first to command the International Space Station. A child growing up in Sicily, somewhat the outskirts of Italy and Europe, grows up far from the reality of space technology. In Sicily there are no structures that connect you to the aerospace world. So, I drew away from the idea. I was brought close to the idea of flying when I was an adolescent. That's when the path began taking shape which, 30 years later, led me to wear a spacesuit for the first time. I went to Russia in 2010 for the first time. I have a special tie to this country. Russia started training military personnel in 1960 and has sent 120 cosmonauts into space. The first man... and the first woman. The city of stars... The first group of cosmonaut candidates arrived in Moscow to start training, but in July 1960 the unit was moved here, 15 miles from Moscow. A top secret area. It's a closed military area surrounded by walls and a gate, it still exists, and was built for the Soviet Union Cosmonaut Program in the late 1950s, early 1960s. The first selection of cosmonauts lived and trained here, among whom Yuri Gagarin, Titov, Aleksej Leonov and so on. In the last ten years, since I became an astronaut, I've seen continuous change. I arrived here in the winter of 2010. There was no supermarket, there was one Soviet-style shopping mall with very little to buy. You had to leave Star City and go to a nearby city. It furnishes much more now, but the original atmosphere of Star City has almost been lost, what I remember of my first years, my travels and training here in Russia. We're entering via a service gate because a cosmonaut just re-entered. The building is in two parts, one is isolated, for quarantine, and one for the others living here. This is the "Prophylactoryum", another historic building in Star City. This is the hall on the third floor, the floor for European astronauts. All European astronauts have lived in these rooms, at various times in their training. The first time I came here, nearly ten years ago, I had room 31, this time I preferred number 34, because it's closer to the coffee machine and the bed is more comfortable. Yuri Gagarin was the first man in space and he departed alone. Now there are three of us leaving: me, Italian and European, Alexander Skvortsov, a Russian cosmonaut and Andrew, called Drew, an American from NASA. This strengthens the friendship and cooperation already among us on Earth. This statue of Yuri Gagarin hides a flower behind his back. Yuri Gagarin is this great hero in the USSR in the 1960s he was the first man to fly in space, but his nature remained that of a man on Earth with a flower symbolizing the odors, tastes, colors of the Earth which he saw from space for the first time. I never thought I'd become so long-winded over time. Andrew, help me out! Mister, Doctor, Colonel Andrew Morgan, called Drew, will be my second-in-command during Expedition 61, when I take command of the Station. We've known each other since 2013, working together during these years, but, during this last year and a half, we've trained together in the United States, Japan, in Europe, underwater, hours and hours of work together. So, when we leave on July 20th, I think we'll have a really good time. Yes, I agree. I should have brought my guitar, man. Ladies and gentlemen... # Superman! La la la la, Superman! # # Superman! La la la la, Superman! La la la la, Superman! # According to Russian tradition, after the training phase begins the theoretical phase which ends with practical exams. There are two phases to the exams: the commander and the pilot of the Soyuz must take individual exams before a commission to show they are able to intervene manually in the phases of flight with the Soyuz that are most complex, dangerous. The first is the approach, the second is contact with the Station, the docking, and the third is the re-enter phase. It is tradition to sign a large book after the exam, in Gagarin's office. Everything here is exactly as it was on the date and time of his death on March 27, 1968, at just 34 years of age. Let's go. It's our bus. Before leaving, every astronaut lays a carnation at the Kremlin wall where Yuri Gagarin's tomb is. It's a tradition and a mandatory gesture. These days are the last with my family before our departure. Then I will enter quarantine and be able to see them only through a window, however, at a distance. Being a father... should be a full time job and for which no training exists. We start from zero and the moment our children are born, we must already be professionals and take the situation in hand. There can be no training, because each child is a different world. It's normal that distance creates stress. In my experience, the only way to relate to our children, to maintain that relationship, is open communication from the start, to help them see that to stand by them, physical presence isn't necessary. Loving one's own children means giving them the certainty of your being there for them when they need you, creating a virtual place in which to take refuge at anytime. Sure, it's the hardest thing to do. My role as a father is to give them the map, the means to be able to realize their dreams. My task will be to urge them on, encourage them, give support, offer a hand, but not give the direction. I miss everything about Italy. I left Sicily at 16 to go to America, right after that I entered the Air Force Academy. I left Italy definitively in 2007 for France, then Germany and finally, the United States. I feel the distance. I miss the Sicilian sea with its scents, its colors, but I'm the result of the life choice I made and so, I don't stand here reflecting and complaining. When I go into space, I fly! And I'm going to America! The Americans went to the moon, I want to go to America. That's what I said as a child and so it was. When I first arrived in America, I was still in high school. Now my daughters study here and I work, have worked, at NASA here in Texas. Today what we're gonna do is a quick shakeout run. - What this will do is keep your body lose. - Alright. Let's do this. To be Ironman still winning the title is fantastic. For those active in this sport, the Ironman Triathlon is a unique event. Hi, everybody! - How are things? - Fine. Hot? Hoof! I decided to prepare for Ironman while I was still in orbit, in 2013. There's physical deterioration after a mission, and a long rehabilitation period. I wanted to show it could be done within a year after returning to Earth. Who could have guessed that for sport, I'd have swum 2.4 miles, biked 112 miles and ended with a marathon? Here I calculate the time for a full race. I'll describe a typical lunch. It really is my typical lunch. I don't know if other athletes do this diet. I don't think so. One measure of nuts, I think they're called Brazil nuts, pumpkins seeds, two measures. I hope Italian food-lovers and international chefs aren't aghast, but this is my lunch. My eating habits have changed through the years and will again. The launch is one year away, I'm ending the theoretical part of my training, now, at last, the practical part begins. A spacesuit is called an EMU, Extravehicular Mobility Unit. It's comprised of about 18 thousand parts. The outside layer is puncture resistant, it protects from extreme changes in temperature, solar radiation and micrometeorites, that travel more than 27 miles per hour. And I'd add: what a hole without it! A spacesuit is the most expensive attire in the world, it costs about 15 million dollars. Among the materials used for the outside are: nylon, neoprene and Gore-Tex. Underneath we wear a special garment that is called LCVG, Liquid Cooling and Venting Garment, covered in cooling tubes to the length of about 300 feet. And we use cooled water to maintain a constant body temperature during extra-vehicular activity, or EVA. A spacesuit permits the dispersion of body heat, the controlling of connections, and the communications needed to monitor the state of health of the astronaut. We also wear adult absorbent pads to accumulate urine. I didn't wear diapers as a child but I had to wear them in space at 42 years of age! The spacesuit weighs about 308 pounds here on Earth. Training has saved my life many times, both as a pilot and during my second EVA, when the spacesuit had a failure. - Action! - Yes! Food tastes the same in space, but it's the way it's eaten that can be galactic! It's like a rainbow of colors in here! Space food is no different than food on Earth. To take it into space, it must be pre-cooked or ready-to-eat, maybe adding water. Ready? - Say it. - Three... two... one! Oh! Well, we guess we do. Good morning! NASA trainers call them "Acers", it's an acronym to indicate they're both exercisers and trainers of our physiological recovery. In space, muscles atrophy and there are problems of osteoporosis due to the lack of vitamin D given the impossibility of being in the open air. All astronauts do 2.5 hours of mandatory physical activity to avoid muscle complications caused by microgravity. There's also a galactic vision... in all senses. With less gravity, the body tends to lengthen. I think I lengthened almost 2 inches. Training in the pool is one of my favorites. It puts you close to space conditions while still on Earth. Dressing seems very complicated on Earth, in orbit it is too, but for different reasons. Here, it's a problem of gravity and dimensions. In orbit it's harder to get inside because we can't push ourselves into the spacesuit, so, in a certain sense, although it's different, it's realistic for when we're in orbit. The pool at NASA is one of the largest in the world. 202 feet long, 101 feet wide and 40 feet deep. Under the water is a partial replica of the International Space Station. The advantage of working underwater is that the spacesuit is, as far as possible, in neutral balance. This allows us to get familiar with the spacesuit, which would normally weigh hundreds of pounds, without the exertion of this weight on you. What we need to understand when we work in the pool is the exertion, frustration of working in a very strenuous, pressurized environment in which movement is limited. It's a full-scale, 360-degree training, with similarities and diversities, but, in general, it's an extraordinary training. The only type of training that teaches the use of a spacesuit. And you cut out a little bit... A spacesuit is totally isolated, pressurized. The pressurization gives an atmosphere inside the spacesuit, when in extra-vehicular activity or underwater, so not to be crushed by the pressure of the water. From a physical standpoint, it's one of our most complex training drills because it's like doing endurance sport activity, therefore, long duration. We spend six hours underwater, more than seven inside the spacesuit, including pressurization, dressing and so on. It's exhausting, we can't eat, we have only half a quart of water and all movement is extremely tiring. My hands are white, this is due to the pressure of the spacesuit. My nails are a bit ruined because of the pressure of the gloves. The spacesuit is adapted to each astronaut, but it's not tailor-made, so there are some constrictions. # La la la la, Superman! # # La la la la, Superman! La la la la! # We begin with the wet suit, the number-slot belt. We go over the checklist. Okay, we're good to go. The Ironman Triathlon started in Hawaii. It was born in Honolulu as the result of a bet. Some athletes were chatting about which sport, which athlete, had the greatest endurance. "Let's have a race in which we combine all three!" One of them said: "The one who wins will be called Ironman". And now to bed early, wake-up is before dawn. At 5:30 I have to be there. # La la la la, Superman! # Superman! It's 6:40. I'm about to head to the starting area, my heat starts at 7:15. I got up at 4:30 for breakfast. I prepared my emplacement with my shoes and helmet for the bike, and my running shoes. We'll be starting soon. JAXA, JAPAN This is JAXA, the Japanese Space Agency. - Thanks very much. I'm Maria. - Yeah? - Yeah! - How are you? All the astronauts tasked to the International Space Station must do a training period here which varies according to the type of training necessary and the level of professionalism required. You pass from a basic level, "user", to a middle level, "operator" and then to a higher level, "specialist". Good point! Yeah, good point. No doubt, yeah. The entrance. On my first mission, Volare, in 2013, I was at the "user" level, so I came only once, for about a week. This time, with Expedition 60-61, I am at the "operator" level. This is my first week of training, there will be another in the second phase of training, about six months before departure. There is a mock-up of "kibo", in the Japanese lab, the logistics part and the robot arm. So this is... Lazy back then. It's a solution we have... In the next few days I will train and use these elements, both to resolve emergencies and to do routine work in the normal phases of utilization. The Japanese lab "kibo" is the largest and most modern module of the International Space Station. It is very well-lighted, well-made and has several unique characteristics. Besides, I've always loved Japanese cartoons and robots. Good morning. - It's fish. - Yeah. The sushi train's begun, time to eat. To know a culture, you need to identify with all the phases of a person's life, including entertainment. Kenji explained a tradition for all those who approach the temple. You're presenting yourself before the god or gods and you must purify your hands and mouth with the pure water of the fountain. It's a little like fortune cookies, by making a small offering, you can fish a note to foresee the future. Let's see what Kenji-San reads on my note. He told me I must be careful on my travels, something regarding flames or fire. So, I'd better prepare for a fire emergency on board. Fear is not weakness, the opposite, in fear courage is shown. Fear is a tool that allows us to survive. Baikonur in Kazakhstan was the world's first launching site. BAIKONUR, KAZAKHSTAN It was built by the Soviet Union and is now under Russian administration. It remained secret for years! From here departed Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, on October 4, 1957. From here departed the first manned launch, in 1961. From here departed the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, in 1963. From here I departed and am about to depart again. From here departed Laika, the first dog in space, dying after only a few hours. The cosmodrome observes strict criteria: 4,163 square miles in the heart of the Kazakh Steppa, built in a secret, deserted place. The Baikonur base is equipped for the departure of space vehicles both with or without a human crew. Although there is no clear distinction between the atmosphere and outer space, there is an imaginary line, called the Kármán line, at 62 miles from the surface. Scientists say the Earth's atmosphere encounters outer space at that point. At Baikonur, many traditions and superstitions are respected. The blessing of the rocket is one of these. This town was built in the desert as support for the workers at the Center. It attained city status only in 1966. Here Gagarin spent his last night before going into space. They say there was security to prevent escape due to an eventual reconsideration, but it never happened. In the next room were doctors responsible for checking his health. Here, the first machines began, older-generation flight systems, but solid and functional, improved launch after launch. My isolation wing. I'm climbing the stairs to the area where the astronauts live during their quarantine. This is the common area we've made into a small snack bar. It's the first time we've used this area. Here we can relax when we're not involved in lessons or training. These are our rooms, they're brand new, they were realized expressly for my expedition, my crew and I were the first to occupy them. This is my room, number 304. About twenty days ago I attained the rank of colonel, but I couldn't have a ceremony to validate my promotion in rank. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Whoever leaves Earth from here must first plant a tree. To date, there have been 227 of us, even Gagarin did. One day, 6 hours and 24 minutes till departure. This is the last good-bye to my family, I'm behind the window and they're here waving to me. - Hi! - Hi. The next time I'll be in my spacesuit. - Hi. - Hi! We've very close to departure. We're ready, an entirely new adventure is starting. During the first radio call, you have to say something more than "hi". You can even say, "Hi Dad". That would be good. The boots are Prada. These boots are not made for walking. They are like size 55. Cause they go on top of the spacesuit. And we only use them once, from here to the bus and from the bus to the rocket. And that's it. So... Go for it! Great Luca! Go Luca! It's a moment of great emotion for everyone. Maybe the greatest emotion is that of a father who cannot hug his daughters. I was the first Italian to walk in space. To date, I hold the European record: 33 hours and 9 minutes of space walk. I'm the only one to have done a concert from space and to have played records for a party above Earth. Under my command there was the first Arab astronaut in orbit. Under my command there was the first space walk made solely by women. October 18 will remain in history. I hold the record for European extra-vehicular activity, six. Space is the metaphor of a story of successes and hard work, the symbol of humanity's desire to exceed itself. The world must go on, it must go beyond. Commander Parmitano is an extraordinary person. Hi, ya all! Parmitano for Italians is a wonderful example. # Clappin' hands, dancin' people in the stands. # I'd never heard of a singing astronaut. But he kept perfect time. # I don't get bored, no I don't get bored... # There are women you can't dance with. What about sex in orbit?
