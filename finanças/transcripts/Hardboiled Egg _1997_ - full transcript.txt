You've reached 687-0953 Don't bother leaving a message, I don't listen to them anyway. Please don't leave any message. Bye. Hi, Lisa If you happen to get this message This is Piero Mansani A friend of your cousin Tommaso I just want to say... everything's fine here in Livorno I mean, shitty as usual How about Rome? That is, if you're there, who knows I'll leave you my number again So if you by chance - What the fuck do you want? - I'm ready I told you not to bug me when I'm on the phone Buy flowers cemetery mommy I'm not going to the cemetery Mara'll go with you. Go! From my diary of those days: Saturday, April 21 Exhausted, I fight the idea of dying... ...in the useless delusion of Seeing you again, my love You may ask yourselves: How is it possible that a boy not quite 20... ...with a healthy constitution and a respectable academic record... ...can fall so low? It's a long story. Let's start from the beginning. I came into this world at midnight sharp, on March 12, 1974. In a place on Via della Coroncina Neighborhood of Ovosodo The super 8 film my father shot didn't come out very well He and mom were very emotional Because their other son had turned out a bit odd Piero? want to play? I have to finish my homework The doctors would shake their heads when visiting him They said he wouldn't live very long But Big Ivano didn't feel like dying yet Leave me alone! Mom help! Piero You still have that headache? Come here darling Mom was always a bit sick But she loved us just the same Did you and Ivano have another fight? He hurt me He loves you, you know He could have "braked" my arm You should say "broken". I want a kiss too. Come on then One day mom died We couldn't face it How could we live without her? Dad loved her a lot They met while dancing in the summer of '65 He told her he was the son of a tycoon from Argentina Who left him a huge inheritance and a candy factory An estate in Canada with two lakes One warm, the other cold But it wasn't true He had been a docker but had been fried For political reasons, he said From that moment on, no one had a clue whatsoever. One day he came home with a big car No one knew where it came from He was always at the bar bumming rum punch But mom loved him Together, they were like the song "The most beautiful couple in the world" Or so I thought That afternoon, Dad took us aside To talk to us man to man Now you're both big boys We can talk straight, clear the air, right? I've been told about a nice girl. A hard worker. You guys are grownups now. We need someone at home who can cook and clean. So I thought I'd have her come live with us. She can also use a hand. And we need to help each other out. Right, boys? Listen, mom was mom, no doubt about it. What's her name? Mara. She's really a good girl A hard worker. During the darkest moments of mom's illness... ...she was always there for me. She was kind and understanding. And she's nice. She sings Know which song? The one you like The one that goes like this I can't sing, but you know the one So. It's a deal then I'm glad you're with me on this Easy now Fucking lousy place Don't exaggerate! It's nice What's wrong now? They're looking at me Mind your business. Don't worry about it Here we are This is Piero and this is Ivano Say hello, guys He said good morning Does he always talk like that? I'll show how we're settled Badly. There's even a pigeon A myna bird, I'll get rid of it. I want to lie down, my back killing me. Is there anything cool to drink? Orange soda, barley water even a nice little beer She's thirsty. Something cool There's tap water Go get us something at the bar So where's the money? You always ask for money When's the last time you changed the sheets? They stink Easy, baby Quiet Wait Come and see I can do that too? No, not you You? No, just Dad Thank God Damn I can't take it anymore Damn that fucking bastard who ruined you Did you get the towel? Maybe we should take her to the hospital. I'll call an ambulance No hospital She doesn't want to go Her mother died there Your Dad, where is that goddamned son of a bitch? Don't you think she's a bit ugly? She's all right If she turns out ugly, I'll drown her Understand, Diana? Don't you dare turn out ugly Ugly women are all unhappy You called her Diana? Like the Greek goddess and the wife of Prince Charles Now she's got it good He may be ugly But think of the money, the castles the jewels I would go for that It must be your Dad. Mr. Nedo Mansani, please. He's not here We've got a search warrant Search the bedroom There were words on the warrant I had only heard in the movies. Arrest warrant Criminal association Default, fugitive Understand? This is my house Who knows what Dad had done Where he had gone? At the time, I didn't ask certain questions For some time, I was taken with something else Take a guess. Girls! The other half of paradise I wondered: Now that I'm the son of a fugitive Will it be better or worse? What would girls think? Would they avoid me? Admire me? I was under a spell They were like aliens to me I was kind of afraid. What were they thinking about? Did they feel what I was feeling? I didn't know what I wanted from them But I wanted it bad The first symptom showed up one summer afternoon I wasn't quite nine years old Striker Paolo Rossi gets ready to take the penalty kick German goalie Schumacher is ready to make the save! Whoever kicks it out, gets it Whoever smelt it, dealt it. Up your nose with a rubber hose If it doesn't fit, sit on it I'm rubber, you're glue Whatever you say It it exactly three in the afternoon of July 11, 1982 A fateful day In a few hours, Italy will win its third World Cup. That night, while everyone was proud to be Italian, (and to be from Livorno) I was feeling very, very confused. From then on, the world seemed to me to be a place Where divergent creatures were drawn together to mate That idiot spends all day in the bathroom. Some day I'll leave the gas on and blow us all up. What have I done wrong? Tell me, Ivano I just want to be happy and have a lot of money A nice guy who loves me Who takes me out to dinner Who gives me lots of gifts I would love coral earrings Shut up It's unfair, Ivano! Actually, the only thing I liked to do Was to go buy milk at the corner store I envied my friend Mirko for his moped For the store where he loaded up on snacks as much as he wanted But most of all for his mother Luana Put it on your tab? See you, you handsome. I envied him because of Katia At age 13, they French kissed I was envious of whomever knew the secret of love While for me, that mysterious matter was becoming more and more of a problem. Poor, sweet Susy Susini Who lived in my building Realized that at her expense Katia Can we go? One second, Susy When I saw her, her reaction was indecipherable to me. Did you say something? No. I mean I said hello I thought so, sorry Are you okay? I was convinced she couldn't stand me But her best friend Katia told me she liked me a lot. In fact, one day she called me Susy wants you to know she's into you... ...but Toto, Sergino and Juri also like her a lot... ...they even told her that. But if you want you two can go out Right away. What should I tell her? Can you repeat the question? Sorry, but it's noisy in here Do I have to give you an answer now? Okay I said yes Thanks, don't worry about it Tell her I said hello What did he say? He was happy, his voice was shaking This way, the four of us can go out Me and Mirkio and you and Piero I've got a girlfriend I read from my diary at the time Wednesday, May 14, 1987 I can't describe how I feel since I've found a girlfriend Is this love? It seems more like pride Is love pride? Think about it How's it going? Okay. You? Not bad Good You going home? Yeah, and you? I'm going out for a little while See you later Bye. Maybe I took too long to think about it In fact, a few days later Katia called me Susy doesn't want to go out with you anymore Fine, bye I have to admit I felt a strange sadness What did he say? "Fine, bye" Forget about him, Ovosodo's a nerd Should I call Sergino? No Come on I said no My girlfriend left me Where did I go wrong? Why couldn't I do what others do? I couldn't see myself making 'cucci-cucci' Whispering sweet nothing without feeling like an idiot I thought "what if I'm like Fabio?". Or even like Danielino? But no, that wasn't me... Even though some displays of machismo bemused me more. When I have them bent over in front of me I don't know what gets into me Those beautiful naked backs I feel like punching them I didn't dare let on that it shocked me I lived in a world that did not allow nuances. One more subjunctive, one existential doubt too many... That's all it took to get you labeled 'queer' for life. Dad No, we were all sleeping I'm okay. I'm studying I have exams in June Not my driver's license, my middle school diploma. When are you coming home? Nedo? My love, honey.. You were a bastard leaving like that. I miss you so much. It's a mess here. They want to evict us The police have come Where have you been? Don't worry, it's nothing I'll talk to the judge. He's a good man Committed to civil rights, they say I'll tell him what the deal is Love, I've missed you so much What do they want from you? Nothing I've been framed by some bad guys There are plenty of witnesses to prove I'm innocent. People love Nedo, you know Come on, Mansani Just one minute At the trial we found out That Mercedes was stuffed with cocaine He was sentenced 5 years and 8 months To this day, I don't know if Dad knew Or if he was really just framed I even wrote an essay in school, about the misadventures of an innocent man Who got caught up in things much bigger than him. I also wrote that the cosmos is not built on a human scale And that man must adapt to it with little gain Except those with power and fame Which also rhymes. Piero Your essay is great. I read it to your classmates To show them what it means for a writer... ...to combine the creativity of a novel with realism of description. That is, to combine the fun of story-telling... ...with life's dramatic reality Just like Dickens, Mark Twain and Salinger You got an A but I could've given you A+ What is it, Battoni? Sorry ma'm but this isn't creativity. Everyone can do that. What do you mean? Ovosodo really has a father in jail. Battoni, you get out. Why me? You cast the stone and hide your hand. You don't even have the courage to express your opinions. No, actually, stay here. This way you can help me analyze the incomparable masterpiece... ...by our shameless friend there Assignment: "Create a story that could actually happen" "I, one day" "An incredible thing happened to me" "I told everybody about it" "But, swear to god, nobody believed me" "that it actually really happened for real." "Everybody would have thought that" "I made it up all by myself to look cool" Now, my question is, Did we just witness the work... of a daring and reckless experimenter of language... Like that Gadda passage we read the other day? Or ist it just just a smiling rascal... ...who would do better to study every now and then... ...instead of spending his afternoon shooting lizards... ...and teasing poor Fiorella? But ma'm Honey, you're wasting your time Everyone knows Florella likes Enrico Tampucci Okay, all together 'The Infinite' by our friend Giacomino Leopardi Giovanna was more than a teacher to me. More than a mother. She was amazing. But some said she was crazy, because her husband died just after marrying her, and that her grief mader ask for reassignment to another city. What a surprise I brought these back to you You already read them? Good! That means you liked them. Pasolini was a little rough but interesting. But the other one... Moravia? Yeah, I know It made me depressed but maybe it's just me. Buricchio, move it Are you hungry? Should we eat something? Have you seen the grades yet? No, they haven't put them up yet I went through a lot to get you a good grade But Mrs. Fazio says you're a disaster with equations You finished with honors Honors? Awesome That word made me want to dress up in jacket and tie smoke with a cigarette holder and go to cocktail parties Honors, like Prince Charles only without the big ears The commission supports the continuation of your studies In particular classics Yeah right, classics That's what it says Classics my ass. Listen to this guy Classics, who do you think you are? A writer? What would you do for work The classifieds are full of ads Help wanted, graduates in Latin and Greek studies, with license Ms. Fornari told me she would pay for my books How generous Know what you should tell her? If she has money to burn Why doesn't she send us a money order? Your damned father still has to pay his lawyer Instead of dreaming go see my cousin Riccardo Move it Ever since Mara arrived her cousin Riccardo and his garage had loomed over my future But I had gotten too big for my britches thank to Giovanna and I couldn't see myself as a mechanic. Finally, I enrolled at Caproni High School on Via del Mare An exotic and elegant place for someone from my neighborhood Like Beverly Hills On the first day I got off at the wrong stop It's about time We couldn't wait any longer Come this way I'm not used to the bus I got off at the wrong stop They sent you alone, on the bus? Bastards Here we are The third one is clogged And there's also a leaky faucet if you can take a look at it Have you been working with Mr. Marmugi long? Mr. Marmugi? You're not the plumber? Apparently, I didn't carry myself like the students from this school But so as not to be rude I was about to roll up my sleeves and take a look at that faucet. Sorry Section A was the most prestigious I never know if I was there by mistake or if Giovanna had been hard at work Unbeknownst to me Biagini Luca's brother? My brother remembers you fondly What a lovely boy Chimenti Doctor Chimenti's daughter Give him my best regards Gargani The son of the renowned Captain I suppose He's now an Admiral Congratulations I'll be sure to tell him Mansani Of course. Your father is that nice gentleman The rotary Club vice president No I meant not any more No? From then on, a shroud of mystery descended over my father's life. So dense it even fooled me. Initiation Come on. Run the gauntlet How about you? Come on curly. I told you to leave me alone Nice going, asshole Moron! Moron! I was no expert when it came to punches But at school, what I could do was more than enough. In my neighborhood, you had to know how to fight if you wanted respect. There were certain guys who were absolutely nuts Furio Brondi bit the heads off lizards. Sniffed gasoline, then tortured us kids What are your mothers? Whores What do I do to your mother? Fuck her up the ass And to yours? What he said Good. Good boys. You have a few coins by chance? We'll go home to get them We'll be right back Now he's in rehab weaving baskets. Silvano Ciriello, we called him "Wyoming" for his special talent He could also say Hawaii Iowa and Palaia Which was his mother's hometown At school I minded my own business But I earned a name for writing essays And I learned how to exploit that. 50 (NON-NEGOTIABLE) I'm done. Can I go now? Yes, go ahead. Knock yourself out! There's only a half-hour left - Subject? - Literature. Count Ugolino Current events? Drugs Ugolino 50,000, drugs 30,000 I have one ready on the European Union for 20,000 It's worth B, B+ Do Drugs Send someone in 15 minutes I can only do three paragraphs Otherwise you won't able to copy them all Make it good or I'm going to fail I was respected, sometimes even feared. Some people may have even liked me But I was really lonely And I stayed that way for four long years In that seat, in the second-to-last row Up until that fateful September 4th, 1991 The first day of my last year. Gargani, see what that strange man wants Finally. How do you get into this school? Normally, through the front door. It's closed, and it's only 8:30 What, is this the Naval Academy? Actually, it's 8:40 Want to know what happened? I just got here when I realized that I had my slippers on I had to go back home to put these on Who are you? Tommaso Paladini. This is 5A, right? Can I come in? Make yourself at home. Where should I sit? Here? Perfect! Comfortable seat, great view. I'm ready, go ahead. I don't know where you picked up these strange manners You're right, I come from classics. It's become a real hole! Clean up you act. That's why I'm here. I feel changed already. Where are you going? Home. I take the 12 and then change to the 30. Where the hell do you live? After Via Garibaldi I'll give you a ride It's pretty far. Where do you live? Don't worry about it. Is it going to make it? Push! Aren't they waiting for you at home? No one ever waits for me. Sorry. Goddamn it. Dry as a bone. We can't even siphon some off. Got 2,000 lire? No. I'll call a friend of mine he'll give you some gas. It's great here. It looks like Naples, Berlin, Bucharest. Mirko They're not back from the store yet. Thanks, Renata. C'mon Piero. I'm coming. Who's that? My brother Ivano. Delicious, really, out of the world. Even the pasta was exquisite. I'd like to come and live here with Piero, Diana and Ivano. Can I call you mom? That's all I need! - Big Ivano, leave him alone. - You're hurting me Tommaso was the key encounter of my adolescence. Like Brian Eno for U2 and Coach Bearzot for the Italian Soccer Team. Glory and disgrace had him as driving power. -Hi Piero. -Good morning. Bye Susy. Bye mom. With him. I set out to discover a whole new world Which had nothing to do with my neighborhood With those afternoons studying in Mirko's store. At the start of our friendship I remember skipping lots of meals Tiananmen, Commander Marcos Malcom X, Mandela and the Panther movement Zhang Ymou, Peter Jackson, Tondelli getting high, Kurt Cobain kissing and being kissed New posses, smelly feet Coming home at dawn with my head spinning What time is it? It's late You know he won't go to sleep if you don't say good night. But what do you care You're on you own in the morning Good night, Piero Good night, go to sleep The days passed, the panther was caught. The students had returned to their places. But that seat in the second-to-last row was always empty. Mansani beggar Paladine bogus anarchist Get out You're the one who taught me what's important. That's why I could appreciate Tommaso when I met him. Otherwise I would have judged him by his appearance. Which was repulsive Tell me about this Tommaso guy. You could have dreamed him up He's funny, smart, an elegant bum. - Really? - He's a living paradox The kind of guy we both like. Everyone is unique in his own way. But certain people are made in many different ways On the surface, they seem simple But inside, there's much more He's smooth, sharp, cultured Attractive, with a nice profile and a nice smell too Okay, so she's nice she's the nicest person I know. She should be the pride of this town I don't like nice people. I understand... In the sense that being nice is a fade Mafioso virtue. Typically Italian In France, England they don't try to be good They care for real virtues That's it, right? I was wrong to say Giovanna is nice I belittled her. She's so much more. Only assholes are nice, right? Good. Can you pay? I've got no money This music will have to do. I stopped keeping up with the latest hits. Tschaikovsky, the Pathetic! The second movement, the best one - How's the ratatouille? - Exceptional. A kind of semolina with peppers? Kind of The wine should be cool enough now. He's not as repulsive as you said, he even brought flowers. I told him to buy them and not to steal from city flowerbeds He never has any money I think he's poor. What do his parents do? He said his father's a gardener, a thief, he's dead... I don't think he has a mother Where does he sleep? All over the place One time he even slept at my brother's feet to my friend Piero And this enchanting angel Three cheers for Livorno! For our second course something unusual and tres chic Chinese Shrimp? Roasted chicken and potatoes. Everlasting, like The Infinite by Leopardi And the Sanremo Music Fest I get the thigh No, I get it. There should be two What's the law of potatoes? There are never enough The inescapable Cartesian axiom Descartes wrote about potatoes? That's right! Descartes is from the 1600s and potatoes were brought from America in the 1500s, right? You know, you're pretty funny. Another drop. The night took on a French flavor We talked about Mallarme Truffaut, Henry Levy About a special wine called Sauterne I felt as happy as a character out of Flaubert I didn't know what was about to happen But let's not get ahead of ourselves Tommaso and Giovanna went to get some dessert Where's the nutcracker? It always gets lost. And the scissors? Who knows where they end up. There's a parallel universe a virtual world. Inhabited by nutcrackers and scissors. I hate the word "virtual". And also "no problem". I hate when they say "I'm at the office"- I hate "it intrigues me". "This book intrigues me". It's almost worse than "engaging" and "transgressive". What are you doing? We spent the rest of dinner practically in complete silence. Something inside me did not want to think of something. I felt like I was floating. My ears were ringing. It was my mind racing To avoid thinking about what it was thinking about. Thanks for dinner, see you soon. Don't ever bring him here again. In the next days Giovanna called me a lot. But I didn't feel like talking. Tommaso just disappeared. They say Paladini won't be coming to school anymore. You're not friends anymore? Mind your fucking business. How nice I'm just telling you because I found this under the desk. If you can give it to him, fine. Otherwise, I don't give a shit. Actually, it's a bit gross. Here. He didn't come today either? - Tommaso? - Do you know where I can find him? How are you doing? Okay. His mother always hangs up on me. His mother? He has a mother? You know nothing about him, do you? Neither do I. I've gotta go. What should I know? What happened? Nothing. I mean... I'll call you. No, you call me Again form my diary of those days Friday, December 18 I feel angry, shocked and shamed of myself. Who's Tommaso? And who's Giovanna? What happened between them? Who am I? Why do I want to strangle Tommaso? Think about it. I think I've got the wrong house. I'm new around here. I'm on my way. Good boy. Excuse me, I was looking for... your son, I think. My son? Where can I find him? He died six years ago. Who are you? Dead for six years? You're not Tommaso's father. Would I be here shoveling? Dolores. This young man is looking for Signorino Tommaso. He's not here, he's in Rome. He's in Rome at his uncle's place. You want the address and number? Sure, thanks. If only I had understood our teacher's little game about famous relations I would have figured out who Tommaso was The son of Mr. Paladini, Knight of Rodi Commendatore, owner of a pier in the industrial port And head of Palchimica Industries which for twenty years has been polluting my neighborhood with its toxic exhaustions. Sorry, I know it's a bad time But something incredible has happened. Did I wake you? I know you and I have lost touch recently But we're good friends, right? So I said "I'll go talk to my good friend Piero", is that okay? Talk about what? Brace yourself. I broke up with Katia. After six years. Can you believe it? I'm a wreck! C'mon... I told her... I took you to the movies to see Cristopher Lambert To see the Vallesi concert in Ponsacco I took you to the Pitignano market for that big sale And just once, I wanted to see the Stunt Car I even had free tickets You want to deny me this satisfaction? You're being unfair. Am I right? Yeah, but don't speak so loud I'm glad you agree with me What, are you going somewhere? -I'm going to Rome. -To do what? To look for my friend. You know what, Piero ol' buddy? I've got a nice surprise for you Another one? I'm coming with you! Just like old times, remember? No. We never took a trip together? I don't think so. You see? I'm all messed up. I may be out of mind but I know what I want. To live my life Enough with these chains, Katia Mom, the store, all that! Right, Piero? I'm coming with you. Plus I've never been to Rome. Are we taking the train? They say there's a bunch of stations in Rome You have to be careful not to make a mistake Rome Olympic Stadium Rome Vatican, Rome Termini Rome Terminillo Where are we getting off? Take it easy, I don't have any money I have to hitch-hike I don't even know where I'm going to sleep. I don't think it's a good idea for you, Mirko. Think about it. Piero, my friend, I have thought about it. I'm coming. Rome! Rome-ward bound! Taste, you want? My mom made it. No eat? I have potato chips Snack for baby Pecorino cheese. They make it here Capalbio 7 km.! Can you believe it? There's Occhetto's oak! The symbol of new communist party Piero too, right? Would you pipe down They're nice The Swedes have always been very cool. Take Stenmark and Bjorn Borg That reminds me, is he still dating Loredana Berte? "I'm not a lady" "But a woman with just stars in her life" If only Katia was here to see all this beauty... Meanwhile I was thinking "When I get there, I'll be cool." "I'll ask for an explanation with no anger" "I'll try to be aloof, like the English do" No way! My best buddy. Give me a hug. He's awake What happened? Your buddy slugged you. You Livorno guys are expressive. - Did he take off? - He's in the john with nosebleed. The Count socked him Something just came over him. Sorry, I don't know what got into me. He hit you, I hit him The kid who's with him is over there Did you hit him too? He took a few drags and passed out He's gone. Livorno! Wake up! You're crazy. What about you? Did you come here to knock me out? Don't tempt me, I'll do it again. Why did you do it? Will you tell me or do I have to guess? I get it. You saw my house and you were shocked. Horrors! My father's rich Is it my fault? Maybe it is, since even I'm ashamed to admit it I promise I'll waste it all as soon as I can. Then will you forgive me? It's not that. I ran into Giovanna How's she doing? Badly, it seems. That night I tried to kiss her. I realized I had gone too far So the next night I called her. You called her? To apologize. We talked all night And then I went to her place. And slept together. In her bed? Where else? On the floor? She was acting strange the next morning. Maybe she felt guilty. Go figure. She said get out of here Then she ran after me grabbed me by the hair Then she said sorry gave me a kiss and burst out laughing. She sat down and said I don't feel good. And then she started crying. I told her I'd see her again that evening. But you never went. I was on my way but I ran out of gas. I started hitch-hiking. And this really nice chick on her way to Rome picked me up. So you came to Rome with her I'm sorry, man, really, but what can I do? Where're you going? Home. What's there to do here? Wait, let me see my cousin Lisa tonight. Then we'll take off. What, you want to leave me here feeling guilty? Too good. Plate, please! This sauce is out of this world With the bacon my mom sells at the shop. Check it out They eat pasta that's half-cooked. They say it's easier to digest. They're kinda weird here in Rome. They smoke that wacky weed. I took a puff 'cause I'm open-minded but I didn't feel anything. Rome didn't change me a bit. Wanna eat something? Finally, you made it Are you Swedish? You look like a couple of friends I met Hi Lisa. The owner of the house Hi, you must be Lisa, Tommaso's cousin. I think I've seen you somewhere before, just for a second. I don't think so I'm Piero Mansani. And this is my friend Nice to meet you, Mainardi. You want something to eat? Thanks. Sit down, make yourself comfortable. Now I remember where I saw you. In a picture in Tommaso's diary. You were wearing a dark green jacket. Doc Martens boots and a striped scarf. But you had shorter hair, I think. A bus was passing behind you. The number 94 bus. I mean I think so, I just glanced at it. Tommy, any calls? This Fabio guy, and Giancarlo. And someone with a funny name. Alex, Max. Alex? Wasn't he in jail? Your friend in jail? What'd he do? Resisting arrest. He kicked out the window of a cruiser. And put a cop in the hospital. -Why? -Why? Are you joking? Cops are helpful. Without them, the criminals would do whatever they wanted. Think about your uncle, they would steal everything he's got. If he didn't let them, they'd kick his ass. Did you hear that? I can't believe this friend of yours. - What did I say? - Let's see if you can follow this. Cops don't serve us. They only defend the interests of the powers that be. - What powers? - What, are you stupid? The State. So what? We're the State. Yeah, right. Let me ask you something, buddy. Do you believe in Santa Claus? What's Santa Claus got to do with it? Italian cops. I've always liked them. Even the Carabinieri. Cops have a cooler more modern look though. Piero where are you going? I'm just going in there. My little buddy from Livorno you're one of a kind. I was looking for the bathroom. Then I thought the stereo was bothering you. Do me a favor, hand me a cigarette. Come here. Sit down. What's going on in there? Nothing. Just talking. Talk with me. About what? Who are you? Piero Mansani. We talked earlier, remember? I'm your cousin's classmate. The guy with a cool family. Tommaso told you that? I bet you're a Libra. - Pisces. - No way! You should get a tattoo of two little fish. I never thought about it. Wouldn't it hurt? Tell me, why do you live here all alone? Are your folks on vacation? Mom is traveling with Greenpeace. And Dad's in San Francisco with his new girlfriend, Claire. She was his patient, anorexic. Manic-depressive, a real pain in the ass Your dad's a doctor? Psychiatrist. Really? And you? Do you study? Last year, I was in art school. Then after attempting suicide My folks sent me to Chateaubriand. Which is an awful place full of spoiled brats Suicide attempt? I tried twice. How many times have you tried? Just about every day. It's basically a mental exercise. It's a normal juvenile compulsion. Or so it seems, who knows. One time I swallowed two bottles of pills that I found in my dad's office. They pumped my stomach Then another time I injected a syringe full of air into my vein Obviously you're unhappy. Happiness is the disease of imbeciles. Who said that? Rimbaud, Celine. I made it up. You're just a small town kid who believes everything he's told Right? Say yes. - That's right. - You're adorable. Now I'm going to sleep but don't go away. If I wake up, we'll keep talking... ...And you keep telling me I'm right. I'm leaving. To where? Home. You staying? Are you kidding? Wait. Wait up, you taking off without telling me? During the trip home Tommaso warned me about his cousin. He said she was a lunatic who just wanted to make guys drool. And didn't give a damn about anyone I reassured him Me? In love? Are you kidding? Three months later Don't bother leaving a message I don't listen to them anyway Hope you don't mind me leaving another message. Another two lines I wrote down. I don't know how you, so exhausted can resist in this lake of apathy that is your heart. May be an amulet saves you That you keep close to your lip liner Are you out of your mind? Please, I'm on the phone. That's the hundredth call today, All long-distance! You sleep all day, don't go to school Get out of here Not a chance, you get out of here! I can't stand it here anymore! You made your brother cry He may be dumb, but you know he only goes out... ...to see his mother at the cemetery You hurt his feelings. Now he's afraid to talk to you! Months passed, I didn't get one phone call, one message. People had started to go on vacation while us seniors worried about our diploma. I said no, do it yourself. You haven't written anything, obviously. I'm done, may be I'll hand it in maybe I won't. Maybe I'll have it published. Will I see you later? No, I'll see you tomorrow. I don't think I'm coming tomorrow Then the day after tomorrow. My cousin's coming tomorrow I'm going to pick her up. Lisa? She's on the way to Corsica. Listen, tell her I said hello Maybe it's better if you get her. I've been absent too many times you can borrow my moped. Mansani, Paladini! Sorry. Fill up the tank. Paolo, how are you? Tommaso couldn't make it so I came to get you. I'm not too bad. How are you? Have you eaten? Isn't Livorno on the sea? I want to go swimming. We've got nothing but the sea. On the way to the coast, I thought "Call me Paolo, Giovanni, whatever you want... As long as you keep holding me like this!" Check out this dive, it's called 'the cannonball'! Did I splash you? Tomorrow I'll take you to the white beach. The sand there, it's like being in the Caribbean. Thanks to the run-off from the bicarbonate factory. Don't you have to study? Everything's under control. Paolino, you're a madman. Paolino? What's wrong? What do you think of someone who when he sees someone he loves realizes she feels bad but pretends he didn't see anything? He doesn't even have the guts to say hello. Someone who loves, who? Don't worry about it. I know the answer. You're a sensitive little guy. A coward, I never have the guts. Even now with you. For example, I would die before asking you to kiss me Then you're proud. It's a virtue. Come here. Hey, thanks. You're welcome. I make you laugh, don't I? So then maybe I'm in love. Because someone in love acts like this ridiculous You don't seem ridiculous to me So I guess you're not in love It's understandable Someone like you in love with someone like me? What are you talking about? It wasn't the first time I had touched a woman's body. But there was no comparison. That time with my second cousin Patrizia doesn't count One time, she smothered me with kisses and her big tits Now she's a kindergarten teacher. I hope those poor kids are okay. Paolo... Then there was Marina We called her 'Vespucci' like the Navy training ship This floozy weaned most of the adolescents in the neighborhood. I want to tell you a lot of things. Go ahead. First of all, my name isn't Paolo. What is it? It's Piero, but it doesn't matter. Then I have a proposal. Let's stay right here, today, tomorrow the day after tomorrow. But I'm leaving soon. To be frank, if I were you I wouldn't go to Corsica. The ferries are uncomfortable and they're always late. Sometimes they even sink. It's too hot in the summer. the vegetation is really dry. Perfect conditions for deadly fires And then there are attacks by independence fighters Dying on vacation must really suck. Do you like the idea of dying? Then let's die together, right here. We'll hold hands and jump into the canal. But I told you, Ernesto's waiting for me with the ticket. I wouldn't even take a bus with someone named Ernesto. Why? Just kidding. I joke too much, don't I? Then here's something serious. Go ahead. I love you. Yet, Lisa went to meet Ernesto. The ferry left right on time And despite my prayers, it didn't sink Now, about D'Annunzio's work Debenedetti talked about a sort of deductive mechanism Discuss the concept in light of the analysis made during the year On decadentism and the doctrine of the superman. In light of the analysis we did in class On decadentism and the doctrine of superman We can say that when Debenedetti talked about those things you said... ...I pretty much agree with him. So you don't like D'Annunzio either? With all due respect, he's the worst Let's review. Carducci was a windbag Pascoli was smarmy and Manzoni was paternalistic. Tell us which author you like This year I read some great stuff Ian McEwan, Benni, Pennac Andrea Pazienza's comics They have a literary dignity A fantastic book by Chatwin, 'Songlines' Nelson Mandela's biography That man has had an incredible life. You know this, right? You know this? You don't? Even in your written exam you showed a commendable 'verve' But you completely missed the subject. You began with Leopardian pessimism And you got lost in an incomprehensible tirade against tourism, ferries And you seem to have something against those who go to Corsica Quite frankly, I don't know what to say. You're right, neither do I. Who cares about church reform... ...by Vittorio Amedeo II of Aosta and his son Carlo Emanuele III Watch out My dad let me drive here when I was a kid. Take it easy! I told them, let's talk about Saddam Hussein, US oil policy, German reunification, and what the fuck we're going to do in the European Union! You'd have done that without banging your shoe on the table! Krushchev did it at the UN too! Yeah, but his feet didn't stink. Who gives a shit, they'll fail us both. We're rejects, human garbage! Speak for yourself. That night, I realized that destiny would separate us I failed because of that exam and that I had too many absences He passed, but just barely They said his father had intervened to protect his heir... ...but I think the school just wanted to get rid of that ball-breaker Who left for Greece before going off to university. I decided not to go back to school Maybe I would look for work, but taking my time. Let's go. I don't feel like it He's not coming C'mon? Diving I don't want to. Go play with Diana. Let's see how far you get by not doing shit all day There's nothing to eat, deal with it. They say melancholy is just the presence of a neurotransmitter called serotonin in your brain It makes you dangle like dead leaves. You get used to the agony and you never want to get better. I was all alone. I didn't even have Mirko around. He joined the police force and was part of the security team for an important anti-Mafia judge. Good morning. I'm looking for Ms. Giovanna Fornari. Visiting hours are at five. - Are you a relative? - A friend Come with me It's nothing but tears here And I love crying. Doesn't this lady have any relatives? Not in Livorno. Why? Someone should talk to her. She doesn't eat, doesn't sleep. Refuses to take her medicine The other day she slapped the doctor. What's wrong with her? They used to call it a breakdown now who knows what it's called. Here she is. Please talk to her. Thank you. Sweetie, I'm so happy to see you! What a nice surprise! How are you? Great. I had a little breakdown, nothing serious. I would've already gone home, but the doctor here is so arrogant. He said I had to take all the tests and he's holding me hostage. How are you? Not bad. You owe me an explanation. How could you fail? I was an idiot, they were right to fail me. It happens. You'll do great this year I want to see a perfect score, OK? Let me see you. You've gotten taller! You've put on weight, you look good. You look thinner. See? I'm trying to keep up with fashion. An anorexic top model As soon as I get home we'll have a big dinner. We'll have chickpea pie. My mouth is already watering! How nice. My sweetie. What a surprise That September, Dad got out of jail. He took that job at cousin Riccardo's garage. But he always got up late and never went to work. See you, Dad. Where are you going? To the employment office maybe they have some new jobs. Sit down, you're always in a rush. I'm late. You've changed. Of course I have. Too much, I mean. I'll see you at lunch. Before Christmas the cops came to take him away again. He'd stolen a car with two gypsies as accomplices. But he had enough time to get Mara pregnant again. Nice one. Awesome. 9,200 - 250... He broke the piggy bank. That's all I have. You're in bad shape. Take this, smoke to Sergino's health. Thanks! Hey! What an honor for our bowling alley: the great Piero Mansani. How are you? Not bad. You look good. Are you running out to one of your million commitments? No. We're going to have a pizza later. If you don't have anything better to do and if we don't seem too boring to you... This is my first love I had a crush on him and he didn't even look at me What a fool. Thanks, but I left my wallet at home It's my treat! After graduation, I applied for a job at the hospital And lucky, they hired me right away. The salary isn't bad, I'm saving up to rent an apartment. That's great, and you probably have a boyfriend too. Tell me about it. I broke up with Alessandro in July. A total idiot. His life was the gym soccer and the stadium. I saw all the Livorno games Home and away! - Fascinating - Isn't it? And let's not even talk about sex! One time after we had done it I saw he was down, so I asked him: Anything wrong? He said: I'm not satisfied with my pecs and lower abs. When you and I were going out. so to speak... I used to play a silly game When I heard you coming down I would run to the peephole and tried to gess what you were wearing. If I guessed right, it meant you were in love with me It couldn't have been hard. I always wore the same stuff. That's how I fooled myself! Thank for the pizza, goodnight. No problem. Wait! Sorry, but I thought "who knows when I'll get another chance"! I thought, check out Susy! And also maybe I could give it a try Maybe I'll look for her tomorrow Instead, they came looking for me. Guys from the military. Three months of training in Barletta. Then to Rome's grenadiers. Where, during leave, I reminisced about that brief trip to the capital years ago. The TV presenter Frizzi lives here with his wife Rita The TV host Maria Giovanna Elmi lives over there With her husband Gianfranco and their daughter Marianna Next door to the anchor-man Funari who moved to Milan His first wife lives here with their daughter You Romans just can't understand. You're used to living with celebrities. But it's different for us hicks. Mansani, tell them. I was saying, whoever was born in Rome doesn't understand Where's he going? Bastard! Get your hands off her! Running away, huh? - You okay? - What are you doing here? I've been transferred. But I'll be sent near home soon. I had my big shot uncle recommend me for the post. It's great to see you! Me too. Where'd you go? I missed you. Mansani, what the hell! I'm right here! Duty calls. You look cute in uniform. You too, even without a uniform. Call me. Despite my big shot uncle, I was sent to the extreme north. to guard the inviolable border. I called Lisa, but I always got the usual machine. I thought it was over between us, but then... I found a train that was coming up here So I thought I'd surprise you. Do you mind? -Wine? -Thanks. Want something else? I don't know what we can do now This place only has an arcade and a bar with a juke box. The closest cinema is in Udine. I could borrow a car but I don't have a license. Do you? Let's go upstairs. Sure. Let's go. What's wrong? I feel a bit... I have to be back in barracks in twenty minutes Or I'll be in trouble. Sorry Tomorrow I'll get a pass and I'll come get you. We can go for a ride. - Gorizia is pretty interesting. - You're going? There's this sergeant who's been picking on me. - You make me sick. - What? You were right, you're a coward. Even worse, a liar! You said you love me. It's not true, you don't love me. It's been a long time. No one likes me. That's not true. I never want to see you again! Maybe it's better if we talk tomorrow. I never saw her again. I heard she joined a Buddhist ashram. She's doing okay and she has a boyfriend, a holy man. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank this Buddha. Because Lisa could have met a bad end. Like poor Giovanna, a few months later. She swallowed all the medicine she has refused to take. She took them all in one gulp. So you're looking for work? I've applied everywhere. Even at your father's factory. Are they hiring? I hope they bomb the place. It's polluting half the city. Well, you live in the other half! - Now I live in Pisa - You must have taken a lot of exams. Not even one. The school is a dumping ground for small time losers. But some folks are really interesting. Like the ones who do theater with me. What are you doing? We're working on Dostoevsky. Our first play debuts on Sunday. What's it about? Come, so you can see for yourself. Welcome to St. Petersburg Piotr Nedovic Mansanski. Seems like you've decided to be happy at any cost. What are you doing? You crazy? Welcome to St. Petersburg! Come sleep with us Pavel Pavlovic. Miss Claudia Petrovna and I await you for tea. Hey there, handsome stranger. Do you know how to dance? I'm a friend of Tommaso's. Come with me. Velcaninov is very angry with you. Who? You're a handsome scoundrel! Take advantage of this poor body it'll cost you just a few kopecs. Really, I don't have a lira. This won't cost you anything, stranger. Wretched bourgeois. You think men are dogs. You judge everyone in your small-minded way. You're all vermin, you disgust me! Disgusting! Shut up, you fool! I liked it. I've never been to the theater. I thought I'd be bored. But instead it was like being St. Petersburg, not Pisa. -Are you messing with me? -No! But I didn't understand the plot very well. Go to hell, you and the plot. Here you go, handsome stranger. Tommaso didn't even introduce us. Piero, Cristina, my...what are you? My concubine, lover, geisha... Whatever you want, I love him. Pleased to hear it. She's cute. Congratulations. I didn't know you had a girlfriend. If you want to take advantage, go ahead. I saw how you two were kissing. - Actually... - I know, I know, she kissed you. She also stuck her tongue in the light technician's mouth. Maybe she just wanted to draw my attention. Too bad, she's really cute. This fucking love that you all talk about depresses me. I just want to live alone like a dog And rummage through the garbage of life. Like that Hungarian poet used to say What's his name? Give it a rest, like my uncle from Lucca used to say. That night, I got over any regrets I had about not studying. I was lucky because at the time, April 1994. I was unexpectedly blessed by the new Italian miracle. I got one of those million jobs that the new government promised. At Tommaso's father's factory without even a recommendation. The job waiting list is a kind of hit parade of the unlucky ones. With a dead mother, a dad in prison and a handicapped brother... ...I entered the top ten triumphantly. Keep in mind that Genercomit Europa is rallying big time. But the Fideuram index is low. You won't do shit with the Fideuram index. Actually, it's important. You have to go with secure Italian funds. Capital Credit, for example has been performing well. There's no question if you ask me: Either Marks or Treasury bonds. How much have you invested? Nothing, but if I had money... My co-workers, most of them older and married, were much different than what I'd imagined... ...during my revolutionary high school days. They used to pick on me but they like me. Because I tried to lighten up the endless work day. So does Pip get together with Estrella? Piero, does he? Hold on. First , there's the inheritance he got from the convict. The guy Pip helped out? Yeah, and after finding him with his friend Herbert. He tries to help him escape to Australia, But he fails! After the daring escape by boat on the Thames He is arrested They arrested Pip? You idiot. The other one Does he get together with Estrella? Wait! After the fire which kills Mrs. Avisham, Estrella frees herself from the old woman and goes with Pip. And then they fuck It doesn't say in the story. This Dickens guy really made us suffer though a bunch of shit. I really identified with Uncle Joe. He was kind and patient with Miss Gargery. It was like seeing myself with my wife. Bube has to hide out because they're after him. And Mara decides to stay with him at the hunters' shed And they fuck. Right. And then the party car comes to take them away to Russia. Does she go with him? She stays and waits for him. She finds a job and she goes out with a really nice guy... ...who takes her out on Sundays. And she fuck him too. God, you are disgusting No, they don't fuck. Everyone knows she's Bube's girl, and she wants to remain faithful to him. In fact, when Bube comes back for the trial... They convict him? He killed a cop and his son! They won't give him a medal. right, Piero? Are you Mansani? You're expected in the manager's office. Order in the court: We can only take three opinions. - I think they're going to fire him. - I think they're promoting him. I think they're going to fuck. This way. Who wants to see me? Mr.Paladini, in the conference room. Mr. Mansani, sir. Dear Piero, finally! I trouble you because we wanted to surprise Tommaso. Today is his birthday. Do you know my wife? Diletta, this is Piero. Chiara, her sister. Head of HR, Lucarelli, my son-in-law. The commercial director, Mr. Bruni All set? We have the candles. Turn off the lights! You're all crazy, I'm out of here. Blow the candles out! Speech! His dad spoke, announcing that Tommaso was going to the States. Since he hadn't done anything in Pisa, They sent him to Harvard. He said he couldn't wait for Tommaso to take his place. So he could enjoy his retirement in Cuba with commies and palm trees. But maybe he was joking, who knows. Tommaso has told me so much about you and you family - Your father, the poor dear. - I know I made you a little package from what was left over, so you can bring it to your brother and the woman who lives with you. And give them my best regards. I mean it, I care. Thank you, you shouldn't have Let's go. Are you really going to America? They think I'm going to study business administration. I already know the low-down on Boston's jazz clubs. There's a cool artists' community. It's only two hours by train to New York! Why don't you come too? Me? To do what? Just come, you'll see when you get there. Maybe one of these days. Check it out. Dad's present. Useless, I can't even take it to Boston. Want to go for a ride? No, I have to go back in. Otherwise your father'll fire me. My friend. Good luck. I got you all dirty. When I get there I'll call you and give you my address. I got home depressed that day As if all I had ahead of me was my pension. Luckily, I was wrong. - On the luggage rack? - Yeah, thanks. - Moving? - Yep. I'll put this over there. I found a lovely apartment. Top floor, with a view of the Fortress. You have to come see me. I can come now, if you want. so I can help. Great I don't pay much either. 120,000 with rent control. Believe that? A teacher used to live here but they said she was transferred. I think this is the key, I have to change the lock. Great. What do you think? Small, but it's got a certain charm. Now it's empty, but check out the terrace. Buricchio! Who's this? Never met him before. Think he's hungry? C'mon. I'll give you some milk. See how things turn out? One person's misfortunes leave room for another's happiness. Where solitude and desperation used to live You can bring back a little I don't know how to call it... Hope? Joy? Love? They're all big words but you got the picture. Were you careful? Not me. Were you? You didn't take, you didn't have... Nothing. Great. Honey... What's wrong? Are you crying? From that day on, we saw each other every day. In exchange for some odd jobs I found dinner on the table. Not like that, you have to brush That's why it didn't work She convinced me to get that damned diploma by self study. Now some dates. -Unification of Italy? -61 -Porta Pia? -70 - Crispi government? - 1885, 1886 Colonial policy. -That's enough. -What? You want your son to have an ignorant father? What do I care, I don't have kids and I don't want any. You're not pregnant, are you? Six weeks. What do we do now? I didn't tell you so you could decide what to do. I've already decided. You want to keep it. Of course. What if they don't renew my contract, what if I'm unemployed? Who asked you for anything? I have a job. I get a year's maternity leave, my mom will help me out. Are you hungry? So what, I don't count? Do what you want. I can tell people that he's the son of a hospital patient. A fallen aristocrat whom I made happy on his death bed. You're joking. You're crazy. A kid is a huge responsibility. I feel sick. Poor baby, he's sick. That's right. If it's a girl, you've got to call her Giovanna. Like Joan of Arc? I was thinking Valentina, Martina... No, Giovanna sounds better. Giovanna Mansani. Can I have some water? I've got something stuck right here. Like I ate a hard-boiled egg with the shell and all. It doesn't go up or down. In July, I got my diploma. In September we took the leap. The ceremony was nice, even though a bit tiring. There was Mirko, who had married Katia, of course. They're expecting a second kid. He risked his life protecting that judge in Sicily. Then lost his hand in a stupid accident But not his sense of humor. With the compensation he opened a sandwich bar. He told me, "I need a hand". And burst into laughter. Every now and then I work for him to make a little extra. Dad is almost done going time. If all goes well, he'll be out before Christmas. Big Ivano is doing really well. The doctors finally faced the facts. A Swiss psychiatrist from Lucca is writing an article on his case. He goes out alone now and spends time with his African buddies. I'd pay to know what they talk about And in what language? I figured, maybe he's not retarded. Maybe he's just a foreigner. Giovanna was born in October. Everyone says she looks exactly like me when I was a baby. Thanks to my diploma I'm working with computers in Sales. I use the Internet from time to time. One day I happened to find The website of one Tommy Paladini from Boston. He offers catalogs of on-line exhibits, bootleg tapes, Maps of alternative Boston, all at give-away prices. One of these days I'm going to send him an e-mail. Every morning, before bringing Giovanna to daycare and going to work in the hospital, Susy drives me to work. And rain or shine she always says the same thing... You get more handsome everyday. And I go to work nice and happy! Maybe I've become a complete idiot Or maybe just I'm happy Except for that sort of hard- boiled egg inside which doesn't go up or down, But which keeps me company now like an old friend.
