You idiot! You haven't clue what you're doing. Look at the mess you've made. What, do you think that my train is a flute? I just wanted to play, Uncle Alex. I'm sorry. But you have to know how to operate it. And now look what you've done. All the electrical circuits have shorted. God knows why you did this. This train is for you and Liz, but when only you're old enough to understand it. You're always pushing everybody. There's no sense in trying to teach you how to play a game. I don't understand why you can't play nicely and fairly. You're always pushing people. You know what, Federico? Everyone's always hollering at me, treating me like a baby. But you just wait. Once I'm big, I'll get myself a sports car. Then I'll become a famous driver, a world champion. The two of us will be invincible. You and me together will beat every record on the books. We'll even be more famous than Bert and Ernie. Introducing the world's youngest race car driver Toby who's just seven years old. You heard me right, ladies and gentlemen. He's only seven, but what a champ! Toby is about to perform an exploit so daring that no one has ever tried it before. The crowd goes wild as Toby strides with confidence over to his remarkable automobile. He gets into his car, his trusted friend and duck Federico splashing as always at his side. This amazing team is out to pulverize Franco Hitabanjo's record of 3.49 seconds set on January 23 in Rome, Italy. Let's see if he can do it. Something seems wrong-- wait a minute-- on the track. Hold it. Oh, no, how terrible! Toby's car is on fire. What a terrible development this is, ladies and gentlemen. The crowd's more than a little disappointed. They've come to see Toby drive. But wait. Toby has a brilliant idea. What's he doing over there? Let's watch him. He's ta king the water from Federico's tarp lining and throwing it on the fire. What brains! What courage! Ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable. It's incredible. Toby's getting back into his car. He won't let his fans down. Here he goes. He's done it! Toby has beaten the record. The crowd is going wild. He's done it! And now this vast crowd acknowledges this incredible feat by this remarkable young driver. Toby has beaten the world record. He'll be carried over to the stand where he'll be given his reward for an incredible feat by a very young and talented driver. To the winner of the Grand Prix international, Toby, the greatest hero in history, greater than Caesar, greater than Tarzan, greater than Mickey Mouse, congratulations. lam the best! lam the champion! I did it! Yes, sir, I am the best! lam the champion! Again? You spend your whole day dreaming. They're dressed in their Sunday best. Uh-huh, l wonder what they're waiting for. Here's Hoang, the little boy we talked to you about. We hope everything will work out just fine. Hello,Hoang. Hello. Liz, Toby, come quickly. Look, you have a new friend, a little boy of your age. Isn't he cute? Come on, give him a kiss. He will be your friend during your vacation. When school starts, a family will adopt him. So you have a playmate. Go on, say hello. You're about as friendly as a prickly pear. Well, in any case, he can't have my room. I got an A in my piano lessons. Toby only got a B. And you promised I could have the room all to myself. What's the matter with you? No one will chase you out of your room. He'll have a room of his own. He's a little boy who has suffered a great deal. He's a refugee from Cambodia-- you know, like on television. Go on, say hello. Hello. - Everything seems all right. - They are good children after all. Goodbye, sir. Behave yourself, Federico. Goodbye. I'm sure you'll be great friends. You must be starving after all that excitement. There you are. My dear. Thank you, my clear. Behave yourselves now. Are they eating? What's going on? All aboard! Don't load yourselves. It's only a picnic. We need to bring everything to go exploring. God only knows what may happen. We certainly have to bring the chocolate cupcakes along. We should bring my compass. We might need it in the forest. It's only a little wood. It's not a wood. It's a forest. Well, be careful. And don't forget to be back by 7:00 at the latest. Don't worry, I've got my quartz watch. But you hardly even know how to tell time. When I was your age I-- You're so keen on this picnic. Goodbye, my dears. It's not a picnic. It's a field trip. Oh. Hey, Hoang, we'll show you the Indian cabin that Uncle Alex built for us. I have something to show you too, something you've never seen before. Toby, the youngest astronaut in history, pedals his bicycle through the quartz dunes of the Faraway star in the Nemesis galaxy. What terrible dangers await our hero there? Toby, with unbelievable courage, is off to rescue Superwoman from a tragic ordeal. She's being held prisoner inside a fortress made of an indestructible transparent steel alloy known to scientists as Omega H23. I'm going to get you out of there. Who put you in this prison, Miss Superwoman? The Cyclops mutants from the constellation Foosley. Run and warn emergency headquarters. Tell them to bring a bar cutter. You can't possibly get me out of here all alone. You're very courageous but you're only a child. Don't waste time. Get on your space bike and fly off to warn the squadron. With my special interspatial teechy-teemy spheres, I'm the strongest person alive. Oh, it's marvelous. Toby, pay attention. You're always daydreaming. We're almost to the cabin, Hoang. It's just over the hill. I've got a neat card trick I want to show you, Hoang. When we put the card down one after the other like so- we get the Wheel of Fortune, the Jester and the Blackjack and then-- These cards are strange. They're carrot cards. Tarot cards. What's the matter? Don't you like my cards? Give me your gold or I'll kill him! Right now! What's that? Okay. What are you children doing behind the bushes? Aha! I told you I could see you. Come up here. What are you doing back there? We didn't-- I can't hear you. Speak up. We didn't mean to disturb you, sir. May I ask who you are? Who I am? lam the Emperor of Peru. Would you care for a cigar? I don't smoke. It gives you cancer. That's not true. Doctors with all their hogwash. I'll tell you what gives you cancer. Soap and water, washing all the time- that gives you cancer, only faster. I'd like a cigar. You would like a cigar? Here, fresh from Havana, furnished by all my subjects. Yes, yes, how do you like that? Very much, thank you. I'd like you to meet Hoang. He's from a faraway country. Oh, the ambassador from Asia. He's a Cambodian refugee. Oh, Cambodian. Give my credentials to the prince. No, no, he's a little boy. He left by boat and bad people made him suffer. Made him suffer? Well, he shall suffer no more because he's under my protection. What time is it? I don't know. Oh, why am I looking at the watch? It's 2:00. I think it's 2:00. If I get it open, it may be 2:00. We'll have a picnic near the train tracks. And then we can start our exploitation again. No, Toby, our exploration. I'm going to climb that mountain like on television. If you fall, don't go crying to me. I'm not worried. With my magnetic lamp I'm gonna go all the way to the Goliath galaxy. Aboard his Omega H23 space vessel, Astronaut Toby has almost reached the Goliath galaxy known for its horrible meteor showers. No human being has ever dared explore its treacherous terrain before. Now thanks to this interspatial program, you'll be able to watch a live broadcast of this fantastic death-defying exploit. A seven-year-old child is going to actually conquer Goliath. Oh, no. Ladies and gentlemen, you're witnessing live a terrible, truly horrifying catastrophe. Toby has just guided his spacecraft into the most dangerous meteor shower in the universe. He will be mercilessly bombarded as he's pulled toward the eye of the storm, its magnetic force too strong to resist. Wait, this amazing child has found a way out. Thanks to his magnet, he's been able to scramble the centripetal force of this terrifying physical phenomenon and is steering free! Toby, holding his magnet, has managed to pull away. Toby is safe! Liz, Hoang, there's a house over there. - Come on, let's take a closer look. - Okay. What is it? It's an old house, I told you. Oh, isn't that beautiful? Yeah, it's really neat. How do we get in? Don't worry, I'll find a way. There are windows all over. I see something. I want to see too. Come on, move. Oh, wow, look at all that stuff. It's beautiful, fantastic. Yeah. Look, completely covered with leaves. Looks like nobody lives here. Oh, boy, it's full of spiderwebs. Isn't that something? Let's see if we can get in. Look, there's a door. I wonder if it's open. Hey, let me in first. I found the house. - It is open. - Let me through. Let me through. Oh, boy, look at that. What? Oh, wow. Look at all the things. It'll be our secret house. We mustn't tell anybody about it, - not even Uncle Alex. - Okay. I'll only tell Federico. Oh, l wonder what this funny thing is for. Oh, a typewriter. And it's still working. Hey, Toby, come and see this. What? - It's a little rusty. - It's a little telephone like in the cowboy movies. - Hey, look up there. - What can that be? It's a factory, you dummy. I'm gonna look. Bet you anything you'll get lost. You'll scream your head off as usual. - Toby- - Toby- Toby, where are you? Answer me. Oh, wow. Where are you? Boy oh boy oh boy! - Toby- - Toby- The locomotive is mine, mine, mine! l found it. What locomotive? That one. Don't you see? Isn't it beautiful? - Wow. - It is big. Look at that. It sure is big. Oh, it is bigger than a whale. Look at the wheels. You see, the wheels have all the connecting rods. Can we have a ride on it? Of course we will. And I'll drive it, because it's my locomotive. Oh, no, no, no. How come? Because you're not old enough and the police will throw you in jail. Well, I know how it works. The lid is lifted by the pressure of the steam. The air lifts the lid when the water boils. It's not a magic trick, like at the circus? Not at all. A man named Denis Papin got the idea that if you trap the steam in a big pot it will be able to power a machine, even a locomotive. It happened way before you were born. A locomotive is simply a large boiler filled with water and heated by coal. The pressure the steam gives off makes pistons move. Pistons set the wheels in motion. Can you drive the locomotive? No, not me. Almost no one does. It takes a very smart man who is trained to do it. There are very few engineers left who know how. Nobody? Yes, there are a few retired ones left, but they are very old now. It so happens that one lives nearby at the railroad crossing-— old man Tubo, a crazy crippled man who goes by the name of the Emperor of Peru. He's one of the last steam locomotive engineers. So you discovered the locomotive. How did you know? Eyes in the back of my head. Where are they? Under my hair. Under my hair, which keeps the mosquitoes away from it, even though it makes me a little nearsighted. Yes. Would you show us how to drive the locomotive? Show you how to drive the locomotive? It's mine. No, it's mine. I discovered it. You discovered it? Then you shall be the Chancellor of the Locomotive. Yes. Incidentally, have you... told anybody about having found the locomotive? - Nobody. - Nobody? Nobody. Because if you ever tell anybody-- it's a big secret. If you ever tell anyone, I'll take you to the darkest dungeon and I'll eat you like a giant bear. You can't tell the secret, no matter if you're under the most excruciating punishment and cruelty and torture. Now where would you like to go? Everywhere. Everywhere? That's a nice place to start. Yeah, we can go up the Amazon. That's where Chief Crazy Horse started-- up the Amazon. Wait a minute. The Emperor said we could go anywhere we wanted to in the locomotive. Isn't that great? For our first trip we'll go to the Amazon to see Big Chief Crazy Horse. My little sweet ones. Poppy, Poppy, Poppy. Teeny, Teeny, do you like this? It's good for you. That's it. Eat good. Don't eat too fast. - Marvelous. Fantastic. - Neat. - It's beautiful. - Oh, boy. Show us another one. Ah, even better. - That's a lovely one. - Much better. Toby, our city's illustrious fire chief, a person we can all be proud of, heads a contingency of firefighters racing off to battle a raging inferno now engulfing a 56-- count 'em, 56-story building downtown. The fire's now raging out of control in this ultramodern skyscraper located at Babylon Square in the heart of downtown. And as the crowd panics, Napoleon Bonaparte offers a smart salute to Chief Toby. Captain, the smoke is too thick. We can't see what's going on inside, sir. Look up there. I think someone's trapped, sir. Sounds like an animal. Don't worry, I think I have an idea right here. I'm now handing the mike over to the famous Cambodian reporter Bumphrey Gokart. Toby searches through his toy chest and finds his diving equipment. Now with only a snorkel and his sheer courage, he races off, a lone man, unafraid, into the awful flames. Oh my God, I can't see a thing. The whole town is just a cloud of smoke. It's awful. Is the Chief lost in the fire? The crowd is clearing this area now but there's nobody who can help brave Toby. Wait... And he's managed to save the life of his duck. Hooray for Toby, our super boy, braver than Popeye, braver than Joan of Arc, braver than anyone who ever lived. Who are you going to marry? If I get married, it will be to my mom. Is she pretty? She is really pretty. Her nose turns up like so-- a pretty nose. Her mouth is soft and so red, you know. Where is she? She is in Cambodia. I have got to look for her. I want everyone to look at these blueprints real carefully, you understand? So that when I ask questions no one will miss the answer. Do you understand me? All right. Chancellor? - That's you. - Yes, sir. Okay, now the oil can, the one with the long spout there. That's it. Hand it to me. This is the Open Sesame. Yeah, when applied to the sensitive joints of my locomotive, it will make my beautiful locomotive live again. Do you want me to put some oil down the smokestack? Smokestack? That's a waste-- a waste. Only apply it where the red check-marks are here on the blueprint. That will do the perfect job. Now look, I want you to get out of here, you weasel. I was just passing through here and I said to myself, "Mr. Mayor, why don't you stop in for a visit with one of the taxpayers?" Taxpayers? I am not a taxpayer. I don't pay any taxes and I'm never gonna pay any tax. I've only come to help you. I don't need your help. I don't need anybody's help. The town council thought that maybe your health- - My health? - Yes. What about my health? My health is perfect. My health is perfect. And if you don't get out of here I'm gonna hang you up by your feet in my chimney. lam the mayor. I don't care if you're the mayor or what you are. I didn't vote for you and I'm never going to vote for you. The citizens have voted in great numbers in order to get you into a rest home. Rest? Who needs a rest? I don't need a rest. I just need for you to get out of my sight. - But you're crippled. - Crippled? I'm not crippled. You think I sit in here because I'm crippled? If I wanted to, I could get out of here and beat any one of your lackeys. But if something were to happen to you I-- Something's going to happen to you if you don't get out of my sight. Get out of here! Get out of here! I'd like to welcome at this time our TV audience to Symphony Hall for this old Berlioz concert being conducted by the brilliant young maestro Toby. Ladies and gentlemen, carried away by the emotion of the moment, Maestro Toby has just broken his baton. But that means nothing to a great artist. He simply plucks a feather from his duck and continues. YES? Speaking- Oh, yes, I was expecting your call. Little Hoang is an adorable child, never any trouble. ls it a good family? Perfect. Hoang is such a bright little boy. He doesn't bother a soul. From the moment he met my niece and nephew, they've been inseparable. Every day they go what they call "exploring.“ Actually, they go off on their bicycles for a picnic. Such a nice boy. Mm-hmm. I'm sure he'll get used to his new family in no time. You're welcome. Good night. It really upsets me to see him go. I've gotten used to seeing him around. It's for his own good. At this age they won't be sad for long. My little Hoang. It is time to go. Come with us. Try to come aboard. Please stay with me. It is impossible. There will be other boats soon. Then the mommies will go too. You have to promise me you will not cry. All right, Mommy. I do promise. Mommy, Mommy, you could put me inside your tummy and pretend I'm your pet dog or cat. Are you crying? No, I gave my word. I promised I would not. I gave my word to my mom. Is she still in Cambodia? Yes. Do you know where Cambodia is on the map? Faster. Faster, faster, faster, faster. We gotta keep the wheel going faster. How do you make it stop? Like this, with the brake. I'm applying the brakes now. And we stop. Now we can leave. We know how to run it. Leave? You just don't leave an engine just like that. No, you have to take tender loving care of an engine. An engine needs food, needs water. You've got to feed it lots of coal and lots of water. And if you do those things, then it will love you very much. Ready? The water is cold. Hey. Tell me-- tell me where the brake handle is. There? All right, good, good, good. Now where is the speed gauge? The speed wheel gauge? No, not the speed wheel gauge. Am I gonna have to feed it into you? Here I am, making you the Chancellor of the Locomotive. I promise I'll know it tomorrow. Oh, promises, promises. To me-- me, the Emperor of Peru. "Majesty." Majesty. That's better. Yes, all of my subjects, they would call me that too when they'd get ready to do battle. All of these people would come down to attack us. And you know what they looked like? They were 6' tall. And you know who I'd get to fight against them? 6,000 midgets. What a sight to see. The tall fellows and the little guys-- they were running around all over the place. And then the midgets would run in and out of their legs and would hit them right in the place where it would take all the fight out of them. The Emperor of Peru, whom you see here surrounded by his court of midgets, prepares to anoint the new conductor of his imperial locomotive, young Toby. Not since the coronation of the Queen of England, not since the Alice in Wonderland ball has the world witnessed such a glittering event attended by virtually every superstar and head of state alive today. Amidst his admiring fans and vassals who make up the honor guard, Toby marches forward with pride and dignity. He is wearing the traditional costume and the sacred ornamental axe hangs from his belt. The Emperor has placed the imperial conductor's cap on Toby's head and will now fit him with the royal driver's gloves. Looking on, his faithful companion Federico gives his nod of approval. Oh, I say, how unfortunate. Just as the Emperor was about to hand him his mechanic's goggles, they fell to the ground. Now one of the lenses appears to be broken. But wait, without a moment's hesitation, Toby grabs hold of his axe and with one clean, sharp stroke cuts off the bottom of a bottle, skillfully replacing the broken lens. The crowd gives him a thunderous ovation. And now I am the real conductor of the locomotive! Out! Out of my land, you trespassers. - We come as friends. - Friends? We've come to tell you that tomorrow we shall accompany you to the rest home where you will be well taken care of. Do you know who you're talking to? Do you know who you're talking to? You're talking to the Emperor of Peru. Yes, of course. Everything is in readiness so that you'll receive honors worthy of an emperor. Hogwash. I know who sent you-- that slimy toad of a mayor. Well, I don't need a rest. Do you hear me? I don't need a rest. I don't need you. I don't need anybody. And if you aren't off my land in the next few seconds I'm going to introduce you to my pet iguanas down in the cellar. Listen, friend, we'll see you tomorrow. So long, Emperor. I want you, you come back here and you'll suffer a wretched and painful death. I'm warning. Mommy, where's Papa? Will he be killed? He is in a concentration camp. He'll be fine. It's a big state school. Don't worry, son. Tell me, do you want them to take you away and put you in another home? No. With a different Uncle Alex, Aunt Elsa and Flora? No, I don't. With a different Toby and a different Liz? Never. No. Well then, we'll have to go to Cambodia instead of going off to the Amazon like Chief Crazy Horse. The Emperor must take us there so that you can find your mommy and marry her. It's so far away. We will need tons of coal for the trip. 0 Queen of Cuts, you who are so strong and killed a lion with your bare hands, help me find some coal. Please won't you answer our prayer? It's for the train. If you help us get the coal I promise to eat all of my spinach and buy you an ice cream cone and draw a picture for your house. And when you marry your mommy, will you know how to kiss her like they do in the TV ads? Show me how. With their noses on each other's cheeks like this. I've got disturbing news. I have it on good authority that some people are going to be in the vicinity. And this news has been sent to me by my carrier pigeon in Peru that there's people that are coming to get me and to put me in the rest home and to lock me up. I won't let them do it. I'll bring my plastic sword, the big one. I'll protect you too. I know all kinds of judo holds. At school everyone says I'm a real tomboy. I would have expected nothing less from all of you. Now I have a good idea. You'll take me down to the round house. I'll hide in my silver locomotive. - They'll never find me there. - Yes. All right, let's go. Let's go. No. What do you mean, no? We'll take you to the depot only on one condition. What is that condition? If you promise to take us to Cambodia in the locomotive instead of going to the Amazon. Cambodia? I should have thought of it myself-- the beautiful scent of perfume and everything. But why Cambodia? Hoang's mother is there. He has to marry her. Marry your mother? If more of my subjects only married their mother, we would have less divorces. Of course. Set the course for Cambodia. But first put out your hand. The other way. What was that for? For being insolent to the Emperor of Peru. But we're going to Cambodia? Of course we're going to Cambodia. Then just hit me again. Must I? Come on, one on the left, one on the right and back. The enemy approaches. Quickly, quickly. Come on, quickly. Come on. Quickly. The enemy approaches. Children, quickly. Quickly! Children, quickly. Quickly. The enemy--- the enemy comes. That's it. Quickly. Quickly. That's it. My little warriors from Athens, oh, may you live- thank you for carrying me upon my throne 10,000 centuries ahead of everything. Tubo. Tubo. Tubo. Tubo. Mr. Tubo. Mr. Tubo. Yes, and for this great feat you are now equipped to drive the locomotive, yes, to the far ends of the world. Long may you live. Long may I live. Long may my platanetariorium chancellors live. Tubo. Tubo. Tubo. There you are, my beautiful iron giant. How could I have lived without you all these years? But in all those years I've never cheated on you. No-- no radio, no television, not even an electric heater to darken my door. I've been true to you-- true, yes. And when I asked you to entertain me, why, you'd whistle-- you'd whistle a tune... ...so that everywhere in the valley people would hear you coming and they would know that your beauty was about to be on the scene, yes. And everybody would look as you passed by saying, "lsn't she beautiful? Isn't she beautiful?" And you'd hold me in your palm when I was in the cab and you'd keep me warm with the warmth of your boiler. Then you used to entertain me-- entertain me by smoking too much. And you'd go, "Puff, puff, puff, puff." And just before you'd come to a tunnel, I'd say, "Stop stop. Don't. Don't. We're coming to a tunnel.“ Because you'd get all of your smoke all over my instruments and you'd put soot all over me. Oh, you were and still are, I guess, a little rascal. Happy birthmonth with us. Happy birthmonth with us. Happy birthmonth, dear Hoang. Happy birthmonth with us. We'll blow out the candle now. Yay! There. And there. You have to blow a little harder. A little harder. Very good. That's good. You've almost got it. I can't do it. It's too hard. Well, I can. Look how big mine is. We're celebrating Hoang's first month with us. Will you please stop sitting around and join us? How can you be such a hypocrite and have a party when you know quite well that in a few days he'll be leaving us forever? - Wait, I'll take the ribbon. - Let's play a game or something. - Let's play London Bridge. - Okay. All right, you two start. Put your arms up real high. Watch, Flora. London Bridge is falling down, Falling down, falling down. London Bridge is falling down, My fair lady. London bridge is falling down, Falling down, falling down. London bridge is falling down... How come you don't sleep with a stuffed animal like Toby and me? If you like, I'll lend you one-- my favorite, Mary Anne. Me, I sleep with this. Where did you buy it? I've never seen anything like this. My father made it for me. Does Hoang live in here? He is my son. His father sent him this. Thank you. Hoang. This is marvelous. It's for me. "Remember your father." Toby, do it right. Now my dragon has red lips, a black dress and a beautiful gait. You'll be the belle of the railroaders' ball. Will you dance too, sir? The delicate surgery undertaken by Dr. Toby, the greatest medical mind of our time, to cure the Emperor of Peru of the crippling paralysis of his legs appears to have succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. It is a miracle of science. Hooray for To by, Nobel prize winner and professor of outstanding diseases and miracles. Repeat after me. - We swear... - We swear... - never to tell anyone... - never to tell anyone... - where the locomotive is... - where the locomotive is... - or where the Emperor is hidden. - or where the Emperor is hidden. To make our oath binding and most sacred, we must do like the Indians and seal it in our own blood. Ouch. You look really silly with a doll tied to your finger. It's not a doll. It's a bondage. It's not a bondage. It's a bandage, you dummy. Come on, hurry, hurry. Hurry, children, hurry. Hurry, hurry, come on. All right now, boys. That's it, come on. Come on, children. Push,push,push. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh. Mm-hmm. Yes, yes, no wonder. No wonder. You know what I found out? They have retired all of the locomotives and the engineers. The one thing they'd forgotten to do was to cut the telephone wires. So that means you can get in touch with your people without using carrier pigeons. Not only that, my friends, but I can use the phone to phone ahead to different crossings, so it will be entirely clear for the train when it passes through. So now all we need is coal. That's right, my friends. All we need now is coal. Do you hear me? All we need is coal. The drums. Look, everybody, look. 0 wire, see me. Love me as I love thee. Forget that I am old. Carry me on your back and spring to life under the touch of my foot. No, leave me alone. I don't need your help. What are you doing here? I'm the Emperor of Peru and this is my dominion. No one is allowed on this hallowed ground except I say so. Forgive us, Your Majesty. We're simple poor clowns. We didn't know. We'll leave right away. No, no, no. No, no, no, you needn't leave. The Emperor knows the rules of good hospitality. Yes, you may stay with my permission. However, only on one condition-- that you tell nobody of this sanctuary, of this hidden place. Thank you, Your Majesty. All right. You may stay. Go ahead, my son. Wire, look at me. lam but a man without your help. Wire, spring to life under the touch of my foot. Dream your dreams of yesteryear and love me as I love thee now. Ladies and gentlemen, we must now ask for your cooperation. Please be absolutely quiet. The world renowned artist of the high-wire Toby, this year's Oscar winner for his memorable performance in "Flying Ducks,“ is going to execute for the first time before the public his spectacular death-defying somersault. But wait, the audience is screaming. What is happening? The wire seems to be breaking right beneath Toby's feet, folks. For our hero, this could be the end. Wait, this amazing lad with nerves of steel has taken his chewing gum out of his mouth and, making a kind of a glue with it, applies it to the spot where the wire is about to break. You're always off in the clouds. To make our meal complete and to celebrate Phil's first triumph, for he is without a doubt the great high-wire artist, we're going to partake of these grapes. Anytime one of us eats grapes, whatever his fate, let him remember this clay when we met and were happy. At 2:00 in the morning they will come for me. I will not resist. I will not let them break me down in the concentration camp. This is our last meal together. And I hope that each time that you eat, you will do it in my memory. Well, it's goodbye, Your Majesty. Nice to talk to you too. - Wonderful to know you. - Thank you. - Bye-bye, son. - Goodbye. - Have a good trip. - Goodbye. - It's been nice. - Bye-bye. - So long now. - Hope to see you again. - Bye-bye. - Goodbye, dear friends. - Goodbye, dear friends. - Bye. Goodbye. It's a gift for you. For me? But what can I give you? The only thing I want is coal for the locomotive. Coal? But there's tons of it right under your very feet, in the abandoned mine. Thank you. Federico, let's go down into the mine. We'll find tons of coal down there. I prayed to the Queen of Cuts and she answered my prayers. Let's go. Come on, Federico, we've got to hurry up. And now, my counselors, I'm ordering an emergency session right away. It's a big meeting. Now on your trip you're gonna need something that at the present time you don't have. And that is coal, an abundance of coal. Uncle Alex's cellar. But couldn't your good subjects send you coal by a clipper ship? Oh, that would take much too long a time. How much coal does your uncle have in his cellar? Liz, Hoang, I found it. The old clown was right. I found the coal mine. I prayed to the Queen of Cuts, you know, and she listened to my prayer. And so we can go to Cambodia now. We'll have to wash up after this. Not me, that's for sure, not with soap and water. And not my duck either. It will make his feathers fall out. You're right, Toby. Anyhow, the Emperor said we'll get sick if we wash too much. Would you care fora drink, madame, monsieur? - Yes, please. - A martini, as usual? Thank you, Flora. - Monsieur. - Thank you. You know, my darling, Hoang has had a marvelous effect on the children. Knowledge of other cultures is so important in a child growing up. Quite right, my pet. In the past years they were always under our feet, changing our routine. "Uncle Alex, show us your electric train." "Aunt Elsa, play cat's cradle," or "There's nothing for us to do." They've been absolute angels since they've started their... exploring, no bother at all. Oh, no. Where do you come from? To by. My goodness, where on earth were you? Here, it won't come off. What will your parents say if they hear about it? You've ruined your clothes. On Sunday you'll be punished-- no toy collection, no electric train. And tonight-- right to bed without dessert. This better be the last time. But he can go exploring tomorrow? I already have given the list of his punishments. You heard what I said. And you should be punished too. You're the oldest. You should have kept an eye on him. "Dear Uncle Alex and dear Aunt Elsa, dear Daddy, dear Mommy, dear Flora, we are leaving for Cambodia on an old locomotive we found when we went exploring in the forest. The Emperor of Peru taught us how to run it. We're leaving this afternoon. Hoang is going to get married to his mother and then we'll be coming home. Hugs and kisses." Signed, “Liz, Hoang, Toby and Federico the Duck." Liz, hurry up. The Emperor is waiting for us. Which one of you know how to light the boiler without burning their fingers? Me. Ah, there you go then. You shall be the one to light the boiler, eh? Now everybody, everybody into the cab. Into the cab, quickly. That's it, children, quickly. Quickly. Quickly. My angel, the Pacific, you're about to come alive again. Sleeping beauty. Once the flame of the boiler is lit, we'll start your heart again. Your Majesty, we're about to depart. Now shall we help you climb aboard? No. No, my dear. I'm not going with you. I will never forget you. The locomotive is yours. You know how to run it now. It's yours. You're just saying that because you can't walk and you think that you'll get in our way in the cab. I'm going to-- I'm going to stay here at the station. Eh? At the station. And I'll telephone ahead to all the other stations so that the way is clear for you. I don't like long goodbyes. Go, children. Go. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Emperor. Goodbye.Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Emperor. Goodbye. Goodbye. - I'll write to you. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Your Majesty. Goodbye. The End. The Emperor of Peru
