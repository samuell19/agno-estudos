(lively accordion music) In August of 2020, I posted a 10-second video to TikTok, a single phrase celebrating the greatest rodent of the 21st century, Disney-Pixar's Remy the rat. Over the following months, hundreds of other composers, designers, choreographers, and actors posted their own TikTok contributions to create the first crowdsourced global musical theater phenomenon, "Ratatouille the Musical," and tonight to benefit the Actors Fund, we'll see all these individual ingredients whipped together. In the midst of an unimaginably challenging time for our industry and our country, together with brave arts workers across the world, we will celebrate creators supporting creators. This year alone, the Actors Fund has given over 18 million in emergency grants to arts workers of all disciplines. Your presence here tonight deepens that work. Over the past few weeks, literally hundreds of artists and technicians have been working around the clock. The TikTok creators have worked in tandem with Broadway professionals to develop their already inspired creations. We couldn't possibly thank everyone right now and we hope you'll check out our digital playbill Tonight is a moment for Broadway to look forward into 2021 and beyond. Together, we imagine a Broadway that celebrates the artistic brilliance and historic work of everyone in our community, especially theater workers who are black, indigenous, and people of color. A Broadway that uplifts the voices of women and queer artists, a Broadway where even Remy, our tiny rat with a huge dream, has a seat at the table. ♪ Remy, the ratatouille ♪ ♪ The rat of all my dreams ♪ ♪ I thank you, my ratatouille ♪ ♪ May the world remember your name ♪ (orchestral music) (gentle melancholy music) (lively upbeat music) (mysterious music) (gentle soaring music) - Bonjour, bienvenue a la French countryside. My name is Remy, and we're about to go on a very big journey. A lot's about to happen. Honestly, I'm already exhausted, and that's just showbiz! Yes, before you have to ask, I am indeed a rat. I may not look like it, but I am. There's a lot of places I could start. The time my dad almost died of rat poisoning and I saved his life. The time the old human lady went tete-a-tete with my brother and me. Quel horreur! Yeah, the world isn't a great place for rats. So maybe we should start with something a little more positive. The man who inspired me to go beyond what the world expects of rats, the man who thinks anyone can be great, the best chef in Paris. That means the best in the world.

So what? - My father is not, he never is. But he's the leader of our rat pack and he makes us steal food from the humans. - Uh, excusez-moi, It is not stealing if no one wants it. - The food you eat is trash. If the humans don't want it, why are we stealing it? I know it's cliche, but if you are what you eat, I only want the good stuff. - Remy, food is your fuel. Taste has nothing to do with it. - If we're gonna be thieves, why don't we steal the gourmet offerings in the kitchen? - We are not thieves. And you need to stay out of the kitchen and away from those humans. Remy, sit down, Emile, you too, and listen to daddy. (gentle music) Humans have made many great things, but they've also destroyed more than I can count on my two paws. Rats don't destroy. We build with what we've got.

My dad made me poison control and told me that humans suck, but there's still something about them that makes me smile. They imagine, they create, they make new paths when the old ones are shut down. Like that old lady over there. Even when she tries to exterminate us, she does it with such creativity. Ooh. What's that? Oh, I know exactly what this needs. Saffron. A little saffron would make this. (lips smack) It's in the kitchen! Saffron. Saffron. - Hmm. - Saffron, saffron, saffron. - It's not, it's not good. (old lady snores) Don't like it, I, she's gonna wake up.

(Remy sniffs) (light buzzes) It's Gusteau. - Gusteau's restaurant lost two of its five stars after a scathing review by France's top food critic, Anton Ego. It was a severe blow to Gusteau and the great chef died shortly afterward. - Gusteau is dead? (TV clicks) - Is that a rat? ♪ Kiss your friends goodbye ♪ ♪ The short one and the fat one ♪ ♪ I'll cut off their tails today ♪ ♪ And you won't forget ♪ (lively jazz music) ♪ What I did to them ♪ ♪ And I'll do to you ♪ - The old lady's trying to kill us!

I knew I smelled a rat. (dramatic music) (Remy yells) - Emile? Dad? Anyone? Ugh! (sniffs) Okay, so you know my amazing sense of smell? Really helpful in the kitchen. Really stinks in the sewer. I barely escaped the kiss of death from that dancing woman. And I'm floating in a sea of human wastes. And I haven't eaten in 15 minutes. I'm starving. - If you are hungry, go up and look around, Remy. Why would you moan? - Don't tone-police me. I'm in a dark place. I just lost my entire family and all my friends, probably forever. Wait, Gusteau? Am I really talking to you? - In a way. I am a ghost and a storytelling device. Don't think too hard about it. Remy, if you focus on what you left behind, you will never be able to see what lies ahead. Now go up, get out of this sewer, and look around. (magical chiming) - Paris? All this time I've been underneath Paris? It's beautiful. - Ah, simple. Dig deeper. (sign dings) - Gusteau's? Your restaurant? You led me to your restaurant? (Remy chuckles) I looked down and saw a real gourmet kitchen. There were real human chefs down there. There was Linguini, the new waiter who had no idea how to cook and his scary boss, Chef Skinner, then the savvy cook, Colette, a whole cast of culinary characters. All of this time, I thought I was a rat in a sewer, but I was wrong. I was a rat in Paris!

'Cause the next thing I knew Linguini came over to the stove and caught me sitting on the edge of the copper pot of soup. - A rat? Did you touch the soup? You poisoned it! - Soup! Where is that soup? - And then Skinner came in and caught Linguini at the stove, a major faux pas in the cutthroat world of haute couture, I mean haute cuisine. What can I say? Fashion is my second passion. - Stop, stop! Stop cooking. You are cooking in my kitchen. J'accuse, who do you think you are? Get out! - And just as Skinner was screaming on and on and on and on, another waiter came and took the soup from the kitchen and served it anyways. (chuckles) Linguini tried to stop it, but it was too late. Now secretly I was thrilled. A real Parisian getting a bite of my tiny rat soup. A few seconds later, Colette ran to the kitchen. - The customer wants to speak to the chef. - F-I-R-E-D. Dead. - It's not just another customer. It's a critic, a second string critic, but still a critic. Elizabeth Tagliatelle. She loved it. - She what? - The French critic loved my soup. - You're still fired. - No. Tagliatelle loved it. Well, how can we claim to represent the name of Gusteau if we don't uphold his most cherished belief? - What belief is that, Mademoiselle Tatou? - Anyone can cook. - Oof, you are either very lucky or very unlucky. You will make this soup again and this time, I'll be paying attention. Very close attention. They think you might be a cook, but you know what I think, Linguini? I think you are a sneaky, overreaching, little, Rat! (Colette screams) - The skinny boy scooped me up and stared me down. I was praying my novenas and mourning for my life. Why didn't I just have the shark lady kill me with her choreography in the first scene? At least then I'd have a rat funeral. - Hey, little buddy. I can't cook, can I? But you can, right? Don't be so modest. Your a rat, for Pete's sake. Whatever you did, they liked it. Do you think you could teach me to do it again?

(chuckles) I know it sounds weird, but hey, he had to hide me somewhere. - Though I, like many other critics, had written off Gusteau's as irrelevant since the great chef's death, the soup was a révélation, a spicy yet subtle taste experience. - Tagliatelle? - Oui, oui, oui, oui. Against all odds, Gusteau's has recaptured our attention. Only time will tell if they deserve it. - Bonjour, Linguini. Welcome to hell. - Colette - Oui? - will be responsible for teaching you - how we do things here. - Monsieur. - Good luck! And don't duck a l'orange it up. - Uh, listen, I just want you to know how honored I am to be studying- - No! You listen. I just want you to know exactly who you are dealing with. How many women- - Uh, well, I. - Do you see in this kitchen? No? No? - Um. - Une, because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid old men, rules designed to make it impossible for women to enter this world. But still I am here. How did this happen? Excellence, talent, and I'm good with knives. (lively upbeat music) You think cooking is a cute job, huh? Like Mommy in the kitchen. Well, Mommy never had to face a dinner rush when orders come flooding in and every dish is different and none are simple and all have different cooking times and must arrive at the customer's table at exactly the same time, hot and perfect!

And I wasn't the only one. Now, there was so much that happened from that day with Colette in the kitchen. I finally taught Linguine how to cook like a real French Chef, tug his hair here, tug him with hair there, and you got to bang it out. At first, Linguine didn't trust me. Pretty soon, we were two peas in a pod. Or a man and a rat under his hat. It's like puppetry, or cooking, or mind control, or you pick. In just a few days our soup became a singular sensation. Everyone in Paris was coming to taste my bisque. I was an artist in gay Paris, tres avant garde, reaching new heights of gastronomical success. One step closer to a restaurant with my rat face on it. - Take a load off little chef. You need a break, and so do my follicles. - Oh, this is heaven. A dank alleyway, a brick of cheese. I just wish, trigger warning vulnerability, that my family was here to share it all with me. - Remy! (scoffs) I can't believe it! You're alive! (man laughs) - Oh, we've been looking for you everywhere! (man laughs) I knew you'd be in Paris. I knew it! - It's so good to have you back son! - Man, oh man, I have so much to tell you guys! First of all, I'm a chef. - No. - First of all, you're not a chef. You're a rat. - Remy. If you're a big fancy chef, in a big fancy restaurant, in the middle if the fanciest city in the world, um, could you do us a solid? - What do you want? - Um? Scraps? From your kitchen? Just the stuff you're throwing out, it's not a big ask. - Emile, your brother's starting to talk like a human. - Who are not as bad as they say. - Remy, look, you're my brother. I love you. But you got to stop living in the clouds. Just come back down to reality, and enjoying the sweet things in life. Five day old pizza slices, crusted at the bottom of the trash can. Sewers so dank that you can't even see your next step. Ooh ooh, bacon? The mayo off a soggy candy bar - two days after Christmas? - Yes. - I mean what do they got that we don't? We're your family.

Just the right amount of cheese. I was happy to be back with my bro and dad, but I just couldn't deal with that diet. So, I snuck Emile and my few pals back into the restaurant. Look, if a few loaves of bread go missing and some Jarlsberg, who's going to really notice? Back to the skinny pasta man. Thanks to our new partnership, Linguini became the new hot chef in all of Paris. Yeah, everyone was talking about Liguini's, (man coughs) My bisque, and Linguini's (man coughs) My sweetbread, and Linguini's (man coughs) My bolognese. Hey, look, Colette would make a suggestion and Linguini, well, I, would have other thoughts. Anyway. It seemed like Colette was feeling some chemistry that wasn't exactly culinary. - Linguini. I didn't have to help you. If I only looked out for myself, I could've let you fail, but I wanted you to succeed. I liked you. I like you. - Look, I'm no good with words. I'm no good with food either. At least, not without your help. - I hate false modesty. It's just another way to lie. You have talent. - No, but I don't! Really! It's, it's not me. - What do you mean? (record scratches) - Blah, blah, blah. Linguine told Colette about me, the rat in the hat, Blah, blah, blah. The humans fell in love, big shocker there, blah, blah. And just when I started to realize Linguini didn't exactly seem like he needed me anymore, A major bombshell broke in the press. Linguini was Gusteau's bébé l'amour. His secret love child. Gusteau, my guy! The real skinny is some intrepid food reporter was curious about the talent behind this new bisque taking Paris by storm. So, she tracked down Linguini's family in Nantes and discovered, You get it. - [Crowd] Linguini! Linguini! Linguini! Linguini! - Uh. Uh. - Buongiorno. I'm Bethany Joanna Germanotta reporting from an Italian Internazionale, did your old lady ever tell you about her secret affair? - Uh, My mother died when I was a child. Oh, uh. - Mr. Linguine, this is Monsieur 2 4 6 0 1, reporting from Fresh Baguette Monthly, for once and for all, is there any truth to the rumor that you're knocking out Chef Skinner and taking over as chief chef and Gusteau's? - What? - What? Collusion? (man groans) - Turns out it was true. Gusteau gave his restaurant to his next of kin in his will, so now that Linguini's true parentage had been revealed, there was a new head chef in town, and Skinner was out. - Quelle bon surprise! Anton Ego is dining in your restaurant aujourd'hui, which means today. 10 years ago, he had said that your restaurant was a tourist trap meant for dogs with no tongues. How are you going to change his mind? - Wh, well, uh, (laughs), um. - Linguini. (Speaking French) Tell me now, what is your secret? - Oh my paprika. Is it my time to shine in the spotlight? I didn't prepare a speech. - Uh, uh. (cameras clicking) Colette. She taught me everything I know. - Did I plan on yanking his hair? No. Did I mean to yank his hair? Maybe. Did I yank his hair? Yes. And did I yank it again? Yes. And yank it until he left the press conference, so I can give him a piece of my mind? You bet I did. ♪ Listen up, let me tell you a stor-- ♪ - Enough. Hey, your opinion isn't the only one that matters here, Colette knows how to cook too, you know. You take a break little chef, okay? I'm not your little puppet, and you're not my puppet controlling guy, okay? You need to cool off and get your mind right, little chef. Ego is coming and I need to focus.

Dinner's on me. Just, - Chef? Little chef? Hey, little chef, listen I feel really terrible about what I said earlier, and I wanted to, you know, apologize. Listen, I just don't want to disappoint anybody, because I've never disappointed anybody before, because no, nobody's ever expected anything of me before. The only reason they do now is, well, because of you. What? Are you stealing food? How could you? I thought you were my friend, I trusted you. Get out!

I returned to the kitchen to find Linguini in a mess on the ground. I guess he told everyone about me, and the rest of the chefs quit in horror, which is rude, but no time to waste. Anton Ego is in the restaurant today. My whole artistic and culinary career has led to this moment. If the gatekeeper of the critical establishment hates it je suis finie. Ouai! Me! - We're not cooks, but we're family. Tell us what to do, and we'll get it done. - All right, team three will be, All right, team three will be handling the fish. Team four, roasted items. Time five, grill. Team six, sauces. Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go, go. - Are we ready to go, little chef? - Allons-y, allons-y. - Ready as we'll ever be. - Do you know what I'm craving? Perspective. (somber waltz music) Does the chef know what that is? Perspective? And a glass of red vintage. Tell him he's got just one good shot, to hit me with his best, yes it's test, I'll do the rest! Don't be a pest. ♪ Ratatouille is served to peasants and the like ♪ ♪ Ratatouille, do I dare humor it with a bite? ♪ ♪ When I review food abroad ♪ ♪ They look at me with dread ♪ ♪ no need to seal the coffin, ♪ ♪ For this restaurant is dead. ♪ ♪ Ratatouille, I never stuttered or misspoke. ♪ ♪ Ratatouille, is this some kind of twisted joke? ♪ ♪ I asked him for his best, ♪ ♪ Is this some sort of test? ♪ ♪ The chef misunderstood ♪ ♪ Oh, this ratatouille ♪ ♪ It's good. ♪ ♪ Mama, I've fallen from up on my bike ♪ ♪ Something smells good, is it that dish that I like ♪ ♪ Mama I love you and you love me too ♪ ♪ How do I know ♪ ♪ You tell me with your food ♪ - Young man, I must give my compliments to the chef. - Linguine told him he had to wait. Hours passed, and then trembling in their boots, Linguini and Colette brought Ego in to meet me. - Thank you for the meal. - And when the story was done, he thanked us for his meal and left without a word. - The bitter truth that we critics must face is that the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designates it so. But the world can often be unkind to new talent, new creations, the new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. I now know not anyone can cook, but a great cook can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than the genius who is now cooking at Gusteau's, who is in this critic's opinion, no less than the finest chef in France. - It was a great night. The happiest of my life. But the only thing predictable about life is its unpredictability. Skinner told a health inspector, and then the world about my identity. Food didn't matter, once it got out that there were rats in the kitchen the restaurant was closed, and Ego lost his job and his credibility, but don't feel too bad for him. He's doing very well as a new business investor in uh, my new restaurant!
