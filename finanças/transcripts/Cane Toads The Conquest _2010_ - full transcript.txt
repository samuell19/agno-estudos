And now, let's take a trip to Sugar Cane Fields. The northern coastal plains of Queensland produce around 94% of Australia's sugar. Arastic rats of labour, Queensland cane cutters are capable of handling anything from five to eight tons of cane a day. In the 1930s, there were some real problems in the cane industry, in. particular, cane grubs. Cane, when it's put into an exotic environment like Queensland, was eaten by. cane grubs, which are the larvae from cane beetles that lived in the trees. The larvae burrowed into the soil and at the roots of the sugar cane. That meant that the sugar cane couldn't draw water, it couldn't draw nutrients, and very often the grubs had so much that the entire crop fell over. The Queensland growers were in dire straits. You would expect the farmer to be much frustrated, to have a promising crop, having to be able to harvest it, and then see it become yellow, and then start to fall over. It would be worthless, worth no money at all. It would be heartbreaking for the farmer to see that happen to his crop. Yes, he was a real problem, all right, there was dead cane everywhere. Farmer's going broke, left, right and centre. It was misery at the highest. There was a lot of political pressure by the cane growers on the Queensland. government to do something about this. In 1932, there was an international sugar conference in Puerto Rico. At that conference, there was a woman called Raquel Dexter, and she'd done. some experiments with the cane tote, and apparently the cane tote had very, very good results in Puerto Rico. The guy who was chairing Raquel Dexter's session where she gave her paper was Cyril Pemberton from Hawaii. He got very excited about the possibility of the tote to cure the white crop. problem, so he took two suitcases, filled them with wood shavings, and took those toads on the biggest journey they've been on in 40 million years of their evolution. He took them from Puerto Rico by boat up to New York. Across America and across the Rockies by train. Down to San Francisco and then on a boat back to Hawaii. He released them in Hawaii and they set up home in the Pacific. The Queensland government came upon the idea that they should really try the tote in Queensland because it was so successful in Hawaii. In April 1935, they sent Reg Montgomery across to Hawaii to meet with Cyril Pemberton and bring some toads back to Australia to see how they would go. Cyril Pemberton helped Reg round up some toads. They put them in the suitcases again and the toads and Reg traveled in pretty good luxury from Hawaii. all the way through to Australia. When it docked in Sydney, Reg got on the sleeper train up to Brisbane in Queensland. There was a lot of enthusiasm from growers. This toad that had quite a reputation by now was going to do wonderful things for them. It was going to eat the kangrabs and save their industry. News from around the world and from around Australia. Brisbane and the hopes of the sugar cane industry sit squarely on the broad. shoulders of these humble creatures known as cane toads. Seen here for the very first time on motion picture film, they are all set to go to war against the Greyback Beetle. By the look of things, this sturdy fellow was eager to go to work. So three. cheers and welcome brave champion. I was with my dad when we released a dozen or so of these toads into the lagoon straight over to our house. He thought it was the saviour of the sugar industry. My father pointed out the first cane toad that I ever saw. He said it's going to grow much bigger than that one you see there now. And it's going to eat up all the cane beetles. When they had been to the toad, he said, "Oh, all we got is cane beetles by the balls now.". An actual fact, we didn't have them by the balls. They had us by the balls. The toad did nothing whatsoever to eliminate the beetle problem. I just can't comprehend because, you know, they were brought here to eat a bug in this sugar cane. That bug is two metres up in the sugar cane. It's in the flower of the sugar cane. Cane toads are not very good in climbing the sugar cane. That couldn't have worked. And when the toad didn't work, my father made the following statement, "That is this." Apart from he cursed the creatures into everlasting flames prepared for the devil and all his bloody angels. I hate them. I hate them never respect. These are the worst things that have been brought into the country. Good vials are placed where the cane sodes started off. They're a heaps of them. At night time, if you want to go the outside dunnies, it was a tractor through the grass. And there was cane toads everywhere along the track. And because I didn't like the damn things, they jump onto your feet, they're there when you walk along with the land. In the wet season, the little baby toads had come out. You couldn't count the number. There'd be thousands and thousands and thousands of cowsers. Cane toads can breed in big numbers. And when they lay their eggs, they're not laying one or two. It's sheer. volume. A female can lay 30 to 40,000 eggs and sometimes you can do it twice a year. The mating behavior usually starts in the late spring and summer. And it's the male that instigates everything. The corner of the cane toad is quite beautiful. It's quite dulcet. It goes something like this. And if you see male cane toads, they've got very strong forearms. And they've got big thumbs and he wams his thumbs in behind her front legs and into a rib cage. And once he does that, she starts extruding her eggs. The major key to the success of the cane toad is the capacity to produce. eggs at the drop of a hat in vast numbers. So to be able to produce 30 or 35,000 eggs twice a year gives it a. tremendous advantage over any native species, which only produces 100 eggs once a year. It's curious if you look at the rate at which it is moving across northern Australia. Given what happened in the say the 1930s, 40s, 50s, it's as though the cane toad scarcely moved at all other than to link up some of these small populations on the Queensland coast. But now it's running rampant. This is really unheard of for any species that is a star way or is a sort of introduced form into another area. They are really nothing more than sort of vacuum cleaners wandering around trying to find food. A toad's a nomad, a wanderer, is what he does. He just keeps expanding. Maybe he's eating himself out of the house and home and has to keep moving. He's very much a vagabondismy. Queenslanders do tend to have a sense of hopelessness with this issue. They. think, well, there's just too many toads out there and what can you do? So get used to it. Well, I was born in a toad-free Brisbane in 1949 and within a matter of just. a few years it seemed that the toad had covered the whole of the Brisbane area. At the Tuang High School Oval, you could see that amazing scene where the. whole of the ground just shifts and there are literally tens of thousands of. freshly metamorphosed toads. Just about every night they're under the light. They come under that at night time and they eat the insects at four. And I'm pleased to see the cantoes snapping them up. That's all that is about cantoes. I don't like to look at them. If you're a. person, it's ugly, not very popular. That's the human nature. I'm not afraid. [Laughs]. That's the word, girls. Full of cantoes, exactly. [Laughs] My grandmother used to tell me, you'll get warts. You can't have toads because your hands will become full of warts. So they're all these, you know, all stories about them, how dangerous they were and ugly in many senses. But as I said, I don't find them ugly and I know lots of people who don't find them ugly at all. They shouldn't be here, but they're not ugly animals. Toads are quite beautiful creatures. They've got this nice protruding brow. And below it you have these quite stunning eyes, golden black flecked. And they're quite pleasant to look at. You can just stare into them. Sometimes you feel like you could fall into them. I had a cane toad, Betty. She was huge. I used her to publicise the impacts of cane tones. But the problem was that she was so big and so attractive, she just became a media star. A reporter might say, "Geez, she's big. Can anything mate with her?". And I say, "Oh no, it might be very difficult to find her." Male to mate with her. And next day the articles would come out. Nothing about the problems of cane toads and say, "Big Betty looking for big macho male." She died one day on Australia Day, from overheating. When you think about Queensland and the cane taupe, the legacies that's going to leave used to be called a banana benders. But you never hear that. term anymore. It's cane toads. The wife and I decided to build a motel in Serena. And the majority of the southern tourists, when they were booking in, say, "Will we be able to see a cane taupe tonight?". They'd heard about cane toads, fascinated by cane toads, and they wanted to see one. So we thought, "Well, why don't we capitalise them and use the cane taupe to promote a nice little friendly cane town like Serena?" The romance of Buffy is what keeps Buffy alive. I was approached about two years ago by the ladies of the craft centre to do a calendar. It was like calendar girls, but with a bit more of a wow factor. And that was a best sell-it went all over the world and they raised money for the jail. From that, they asked me to do the postcards for the toad. I think you could. take some really nice shots of toads. I've done it. Well, they actually look. cute because they have a funny smile on them. And if you get the right angle. in the front and a bit up from underneath, they look funny. Yeah, they're great. They have this smile, you know, and they look innocent. I see it now. What can I do with that? What angle can I use that will emphasise something dramatic? I wonder if I can just tweak it a bit and make it. more interesting. That's all I do. It's being created without a great deal of effort. It just happens. We need. colour. A lot of grey people in the world. Hmm. They were going to get a Grant at one time and paint it as I had designed it in more psychedelic colours, but I don't know whether it happened or nothing happened. And shortly after that, somebody stole the toad. Somebody moved and then, of course, it was great conference. They put chains on it and chained it up. There was condoms hung around his neck at one time, and the name of the mayor was put there beside the condoms. I think he's been dressed a couple of times and brass put on it and all that. sort of thing. I love him. I think he's great. He's great for the town and, well, what other icon could we have? He's, you know, so symbolic of this area. Well, I doubt the IQ of those people. I really do in all due respects. Fancy erecting a monument of any kind to a creature like this. He's got no place in the society, none at all. I drive past twice a day on the Waitem Craft Centre and I rarely see people flocking around the toe. Probably at the time, that's all serene ahead. So I think they have to have something. I've no idea how they came up with it. I really can't think of anything else. What else? Well, I can't read and write, but I've been gifted with my hands, you know what I mean? And as I understand, I've done a good job of anything I've touched. When I. do things, I'll put my heart and soul into it. I've had plans to build a museum, but it was running too much money. So I. come up with the idea of a travelling trade show. So I started mucking around, tanning them and stuffing them and that. I put my mind to it and started building the trailer and building these toe displays. I built a full-man tag team wrestling ring first. It's just something that come in my head. At the time, I got some extra decent-sized toes and I made them the baddies and that in the smaller ones I made as a good ones. And it just shows you the little blokes really getting knocked about and all that. The next one I'd done was the four-Lane intersection cast mesh. There's fuel tankers all smashed up and motorbikes and smashed cars. And there's bits of bodies laying everywhere. And I got them set up as like the parents there, crime. The next one I'd done was the nightclub scene. Well, you've got to snip the backbone and then prize the backbone away from. the skin and then pull everything out through the mouth. You don't make no cuts in the skin at all. And then you just stuff them with the stuff you put in your pillows. When they're stuffed, you can bend them into what position you want. The travel and tow show wasn't a success around Queensland, really. Queenslanders, and they had a different outlook about the cane toage. You know, they used to get people who walked past and no one in the world would pay money to go and see dirty old cane toage and all this and that. It was disappointing. I'll put everything I had into it and... ...with other people, if they didn't like it, you know, it was their problem. I'm proud of it anyway, so really speaking I don't care. I first expressed my concerns about the cane toage in 1963. I was reading. the literature and I found that they were highly toxic. There were reports coming in of impacts upon domesticated animals, cats and dogs, for example. They'll go and play with a frog or a toad. They do it all the time. And if they ate them, they died. Wallace is a very much loved member of the family. I treat him like one of. the children. He's got an excellent personality. He's just very lovable. And he's mine, so he's special. He's special because he was given to me by Michael on Valentine's Day about five years ago. I always get a kick out of the reactions because Vicki is in control of every situation except for when I surprise him. So normally he's had a tear. It's quite romantic. He was definitely a very special gift. He was a very dominant dominant. He had a very strong personality, very dominant personality. He was the one. that sort of ruled the household like me. I think he picked that up from me, I think. Because I'm the boss on a time, Michael. He's my doggy, he follows me everywhere. So, yes. He knows when I'm not around. So, doesn't he? He sort of frets a little bit. So, where of our go? Wallace goes. Come on. Come on. I got to the bottom step and this cane toad jumped up from around the corner. Wally! No! No, no, no, Wally! So, he just simply grabbed him and then let it go, obviously the cane toad sprayed him. Straight away I instantly knew that I needed to grab the dog and wash his gala there. So, we thought he was fine then. We didn't think anything of it until we looked over and... My first reaction was he's dying. Never, he's never died. Get! Get! You're going! The cane toad defends itself by producing a series of toxins which are produced from... If you look at a toad they look like sweat glands. They're on either side of the head. They're sort of these little patches. And the toxins seep out through those pores onto the skin. The way a dog attacks a piece of prey is generally to open its mouth and clonk on the other side of it to crush the brain. So, they then get this liquid sticky toxin into the mouth. And, yeah, you just get this incredibly distressing, shrieking, screaming noise from the dog. Frogs and toads are the Cannon fodder of the animal kingdom. Everything seems to eat them. And because the cane toads don't have a label on them saying don't eat, I'm toxic. It meant that any species which devoured them in a normal way would die as a result. We were conscious of the fact that toads were a threat to the Northern Territory. And it dawned on everybody that they were migrating along behind the mangroves at the bottom of the golf there. The reason that people argued that it wouldn't get across the golf was the. large number of enormous rivers which discharged into the Gulf of Carpentaria. The thought was that these were so vast that the toads would be restricted to the eastern side. As it happens, they went across without any trouble whatsoever. I thought they would have been slowed down a fair bit going across the Gulf of Carpentaria. But, of course, it wasn't a slow point at all. They were actually going quicker than ever. And that generated a lot of community concern. There were lots of people stirring it up even back then. They were crossing the border. There was a proposal to fence the border and all sorts of extraordinary things that were never have worked. I thought it was quite likely that the arrival of cane toads could have an effect on the native frog fauna. Every species of frog makes a different sort of call, and so we can monitor native frogs by listening to them calling. We wanted to set up listing stations down about 110 kilometres stretch of the rope of alley highway. There's a microphone plugged into the computer, which would listen for the. mating calls of the frogs, and would also attract the arrival of the toads. I was one of those who mistakenly believed that the cane toad would simply. not be able to survive the long dry season. But such is their brilliance. I was completely wrong. Every biologist in Australia must have been staggered to hear that cane toads. in some places were travelling one kilometre a night. And that for a little creature that's some half as big as your shoe is really a remarkable feat. Once the toads got around the bottom of the Gulf, they hit much richer. country, more frequent rivers, billabongs, and their rate of progress just was exponential. One of the most remarkable things about this whole toad invasion is how they've conquered the Australian landscape. They've come across all these different habitats where even our own native animals die very easily. I don't think any other native animal would have been able to establish. itself at the speed that these toads are doing it. I reckon we're down about 10 to 15 percent on baby crocs. I'd found a croc on the river, but we opened its mouth and it could see down in its gullet, and I reckon we could see a cane toad down there in the poisoned out throat. Kills them very quickly. When you work and live on the river like we do, you see a lot of things that the scientists don't see. Out in the field that I'm in all the time, I do see the drop of the numbers. We've had gills goannins here, sand monitors. I haven't got dogs or cats. I've got wildlife in and we don't see them anymore. These things I think are scary to territories. Very scary and the last thing they want to see is their native wildlife obliterated, or their dogs dying in their backyards or that sort of stuff, and you know, from such an ugly creature. The first time I walked in was the next day and he was just flat, no. movement, no nothing, and just a lot of tubes and everything in him. The vets came up to me and said that there was nothing they could do for him that would be better if he would be put down. If he's not in any pain, then there's really no reason to sort of put him down or anything, because he's a fighter and I know he's in there. You take a risk if you persist and the dog survives, you might have a. vegetable dog if you like. I wouldn't put one of the children down, so I wouldn't put one of my dogs down. It's just me, just how I am. At that stage it was quite traumatic for us. We were basically waiting to see, give us a sign as the dog gonna live or not, you know. I thought, did I really see that? Well, I cried and I called his name and his tail just moved up and down and I thought he was definitely in there. So we fought back and as I said, Wallace the wonder dog, he came back from the dead. He's definitely changed. Now he's more like, well, you know, what heck do I have to do? The personality shift in some ways has been good because he's not as dominant. He doesn't want to fight with other dogs now, he tends to run away. So there is some pluses for him. And he likes his bass. He seems to enjoy himself, doesn't he? He seems to be self-amused. He's like, hey, you know, Daisy. So no one's home. So it's very, it's very cute. He's just happy to be here. He's happy to be back at home and he's great to just sit on the lounge and watch television. So it has given him brain damage, I think. So it doesn't really do much doggy things now, does he? No. Well, that's just green, replaces red. But the ancient palms still grow. A little north of the turning point, why the Catherine River flows. Her ward is a sweet, her path is bold, nor some gorge, her track, nearby the town that bears her name, first lady of the Outback. I remember hearing them saying they've crossed the Queensland border and they're now in the territory. And I think for a few years, not just myself, a lot of us listened to the They're now at Borrelula and people said, oh, we've seen them on the Stewart Highway at Daily Waters. Next time they're at Madder anchor. And the year they hit Catherine, there was just swarms of them. I haven't been thought about things like flamethrowers and everything else. I stand in front of them and try and stop them, but there's too many of them. Why couldn't we have just had aerial bombing across the whole front of them? The deadly cane toad is on the march again. Now Darwin is the new frontline in the fight against it. The toads predicted to invade the city by the end of this wet season. A new national task force is meeting there to find a solution. What I hope to do is a very small place. We originally moved out here because we like to have a little bit of space for our children to grow up in. When they were toddlers, they could run around no clothes on, no anything, go up to the local supermarket, everybody knows who you're talking about. With clothes on. I remember getting a phone call when the cane toads first arrived here from Marinda. She was very, very excited, well, excited but also distressed because we. found the first cane toad. We had heard that the cane toads like dog food and I went to feed the dogs. and I moved it. And there it was, it was just sitting there like that. I'm not a screamer. You shriek at times. You might have gone... Like that. Might have gone that. And I thought, "Shit, is that one or not?" And you just knew it was because it was so damn ugly. But I don't think that we thought they were going to be here that quick, you know? No. The behaviour of toes at the invasion front is really bizarre and it's different. from what anybody has seen before in any amphibian in the world. They were really an invasion army coming towards our study area to a much greater degree than I'd ever expected. The approach that my group, the team Bufo, has taken is to genuinely try to understand. what toads are all about, to understand the impacts that they have on natural systems. and to develop new ways that we might control toads. Greg Brown was scrapping radio transmitters on toads as soon as the first ones got close to us. and we discovered that these animals were travelling enormous distances much further. than any on the planet has ever been recorded to move. There's a remarkable phenomenon that's gone on in the last 70 years since cane toads were released in Northeastern Queensland. Essentially, it's become a foot race across tropical Australia for the toads. The kids that are at the front of the invasion are the fastest moving toads, the most athletic toads, so the best athletes are breeding with each other and we call it the Olympic Village Effect. So it's a cumulative process and in Australia it's produced a fundamentally different kind of a toad. These large, long-legged, incredibly active individuals that disperse huge distances whenever they can. What is going to stop them? How are they going to be brought under control? I mean, what are they going to be like when they get to the Western Australian border? That means as big as camels. Cane toads are invading the top end much faster than previously feared. according to a new study using radio transmitters. Scientists are warning that the first toads could reach Darwin as early as next month. Once they were in Catherine, it was only a matter of time before they'd be in Darwin. When you drive down the track, you see them all the way. It's a bit like an army on the march. They think that, oh my God, this was going to take out parks and towns and everything in its past. It was a bit of an oshid moment and it was quite scary. Toads are public enemy number one in the territory. They're like a commando, they're like an invading army, they've invaded our territory and certainly they've got to take the consequences. People should take the problem into their own hands that they should try and kill as many of them as they possibly can. by any means that they can. As soon as they came onto people's properties, everybody was vigilant. Everybody in the street would be out. You'd see wave to neighbours as everyone would be driving around, running. them over on the roads and seeing them. You and I were dead, running them over again. Practice makes perfect, I suppose. I think I've got better at hitting them than what I did four months ago. Oh, you just feel the squelch. And you can sort of hear the noise even with the air-conditioner on them. When they're in such plague proportions, people will resort to any method. We wanted to achieve, I suppose, a quick death. We found death all works well. In fact, I'd go out and do my little constitutional with the water bottle at night. And I'd get eight or ten or twelve. He's nothing but vermin and every essence of the word, I think that should be about, he put on his head. My suggestion was, you know, just encourage people to encourage their kids and just kill a toad. Hit them with cricket bats, hit them with golf clubs. We'd speed them with whatever we could find, a sharpened stick or a star picket. I just put them in a big bucket and boil up the kettle and just keep boiling water over them. Put the muzzle of an air rifle down their throats and blow the back end of them out. Connect that to contraction to the exhaust of your car and your gas to the toad. You should imagine a nation, strap a cane toad onto the sky rocket and let him go, you know. The air has made a cartridge of toad loads for 22 caliber rifles and ice quite amazed by that. Kawichi's own, I think the territories are pretty tough place and if the toads come to the territory, they should expect some tough treatment. What we do is we put them straight into a bag in the freezer. One of my children said, it's like they're going on a holiday like a free trip to Alaska when we put them in the freezer, isn't it? So, it made my kids feel better about killing them if they were going to the snow or something like that. Well, we'd have told our children that, you know, we don't kill anything. Everything's God's creatures, sort of jazz, you know. So, we'll try and euthanize them in the nicest way possible. I don't want to put a bloody toad in my freezer. That's ridiculous and most people wouldn't. You know, a dead cage goes in your freezer. They come up with the idea of hydrated lime in water. And I made some calipers. If there's going to be death of anything, it must be quick and my opinion. I can say they die with a smile on their face. They don't injure them. Other than they did. What I reckon is cruel is these hings and batteries and birds and cages or cattle in feedlots. They're the people that are cruel, but killing a tailor, I can't see how it's cruel. Or eating a meat dish is the age of the cruel. People that catch a fish and play them in the line for hours. I'm a big fish. Tell me that's not cruel. Of course it's cruel. The definition of cruelty is, would you say bombing people in another country? It's shocking, isn't it? Killing mine and people in another country. And under the guise of security and all that sort of stuff. It's shocking. You always need a scapegoat. You go down until you can find a scapegoat that you can hammer without any retribution to yourself. And then you get some high priest from some university with a PhD, a professor of this or that, to tell you it's all fine. Well, here's a joke. You don't need that. You can think it through yourself. The Toad Sanctuary here is really unofficial, but the idea is just people can't bash Toads here. I don't feel any great love for them or anything. They're just there and I. think they've got a right to exist. And I think that's the basis of it, that they have a right to be themselves. You know, I'm going to stop them by beating individual animals to death. If I don't know that there's anything wrong with them, they're just themselves. There's a Toad here. We call him "Jawhokey" because you need a hockey stick to get rid of him. A golf club wouldn't do this pretty big. He comes in regularly and he sits in the dog's bowl and has a swim. He goes over and eats the food and goes back to the bowl. You can always tell when they've been here because it's all muddy. They don't watch their feet before they get in the bowl. He obviously has a slightly difficult life. Yeah, I wish him will. On Friday the 21st of January, I was present at Bowen Police Station when a call was received from Townsville Ambulance Control. An ambulance from Bowen was currently on route to the scene and they requested police to attend. Mr Graham Sealy led police to the caravan and I then observed that the body of the deceased was laying prone to the ground. I further observed that there was laying close to the deceased, a makeshift metal spear. It consisted of a long tubular metal aluminium pipe and that it had a carving knife embedded in the end of it to make the point of the spear. I then observed that laying approximately 1 metre away from the deceased was a power extension cord which ran across a pathway from the caravan to the power box. I then approached the owner of the caravan and the person identified to me by Sealy as being a possible witness to the incident. It was ascertained that the deceased and herself had been outside the caravan at about 6.30pm attempting to kill cane toads with the homemade metal spear that was present at the scene. Henry! Henry! Oh my God! Friday night I got the call that somebody had received an electric shock. The deceased's partner stated that she was present when the deceased had pierced an extension cord while attempting the spear of toad. I then proceeded to inspect the hose, carrying the extension cord in an attempt to locate the position where the spear had entered. Tests undertaken on this extension bleed and at the accident's side indicate that this damaged cable was the act of a live wire. Contact with this cable would produce electric shock or electrocution. If a path to earth was made contact through a metal spear and through a person's hand down through their legs which are in contact with the ground would provide such a path to earth. In view of the above it would appear that the sudden death of the deceased was nothing more than an unfortunate accident. Yeah, unfortunate. Any loss of life in unusual circumstances is sad, this one was just a little bit off the off beam. It was something I'd never heard of before. The actual sight of somebody lying in the dirt with a bit of mud just with these shorts on does have an effect on people. Life can be taken away from you very, very quickly and you only need all the holes in the cheese to line up and in this case with this particular person, all the holes had lined up. That event is very much a part of me now. It sort of definitely stays with you. Any animal that knows it's invulnerable tends to be very calm it seems and. they simply wander around with this extraordinary area of confidence. They're quite calm, you can pick them up, you can play with them, do what you want with them and put them down, they'll just hop away. No stress for the toad whatsoever. [speaking in foreign language] We all fall down. I used to sing Dairy Queen the odd sort of nursery rhyme but a lot of them were in German. Yeah, I used to sometimes sort of help her dance a bit while I was singing songs to her so I don't know how much she enjoyed that. Dairy Queen got her name from actually an ice cream brand. Used to get these tubs of ice cream called Dairy Queen in massive sizes sort of in five litre tubs and so because Dairy Queen was of course an extra large cane toad she ended up by copying the name Dairy Queen. It was a bit difficult, I did get a little bit of teasing from friends and. quite a lot of people laughing at me and things like that and I learned to. deal with it. Every pet you have when you're younger is an amazing companion and that's. what I found with Dairy Queen. She wasn't a cane toad to me, she was just one of my pets that I love dearly and I found her quite charismatic. Yeah, she was a great companion. I was never too sure what happened to Dairy Queen when she sort of passed on Mum just sort of continued to tell me that she was living in this amazing toad fantasy land so and I was quite happy that she had gone back to her. friends and was where she belonged. I was actually approached by Graham Sawyer who showed me some documentation. and his battle or the battle he wanted to wage against the cane toad. This is three basic elements to a paint-toad control. There's the trapping, or toad busting as we call it up here. They're really the three elements. The fence runs north south, it's just a simple soft barrier. Now the toads have got this hard bony head and their solution to obstacles is to head but the obstacle not to hop around or over it like our native frogs do, they just charge into it. The idea of the fence was to confuse them, was to break up their migration. for as long as we could. Ridiculous. How can you fence a toad? Build it like the wall in Israel or a firm former Berlin wall or whatever. Any heron, just like landing in a pond, it will get a few cane toad eggs on. its legs and then fly over the wall and then put the cane toads on the other side of the wall. Then all the territory and government came up with the idea of a trap competition. The original concept was to the research, traps and attractants and other things as well. Traps are no good without an attractant. The toad's primal instinct is to. breed and the call is a breeding call. It's saying, "I'm here baby, come and get me.". The toad blaster is a speaker system. It's waterproof horns with a 12-volt amplifier. Every frog has a different frequency of call. The green tree frog, which is very common up here, is down low. The marble frog, which is another native, is the other extreme up high. The cane toad sits in the middle, it's about 600 hertz. And it's...ah... At the end of the valley we have our fencing that will concentrate them and. we have traps. I like to think I'm a modern-day binder, bringing the toads in towards their own destruction. The government suggested that we buy cane toad traps. They suggested that different kind of lighting seem to be more effective than just a white light. But today we've caught Jack shit in our traps. Whilst trapping fencing, great biological solution I see is the answer. Trying to make a virus that would kill them is absolutely ridiculous because if that virus would have escaped Australia, it would kill toads in the rest of the world. That's the other big question Mark, of course. You know, is will government have the balls to get out there and actually put a biological solution into the environment? Even if you have made a virus that would never escape Australia, that would. specific to just to cane toads, which is virtually impossible, it would never have killed a whole population. One of the issues we had when we were looking at this stuff was what you do. with all the bodies. And someone suggested that you could make a fertilizer out of the toads. The process is very easy. We stockpile all the toads in the freezer until we've got a big batch. We then put those into a big bat and add the potassium hydroxide. The potassium hydroxide has got a very high pH level, so no bacteria and germs and stuff can survive in it. And basically they melt down into a brown soup. And that brown soup has quite good nutrient properties for fertilizer. For me, I've got a certain amount of customers, and so I keep expanding in the research and development. As far as my leather goods go, we made bum bags and caps and toads hanging out of the caps and sun visors and belts and wallets. A lot of people are quite happy that it's an exotic skin, but not every lady likes a toad bag to have a head on it. The potential really is in the medicine side, like the Chinese already know I've been doing for thousands of years. They develop toad cake, which is concentrated venom, which the Chinese encapsulate to keep it fresh, and then sell it to Japanese pharmacies who turn it into pharmaceutical products and stuff that will even ride with more thin. I've got some little files over there that they're using the gallbladder from a cane toad. Now that must be so small. I only know one guy who took one of those files, they've got there, and swallowed it. He said he had palpitations that was coming out of his chest. He was red-hot flashers. That would get you high. That would get you hallucinating into another planet. The biggest amount of media height that happened around when the cane toads. first arrived was more about the interest in this sort of mild intoxication that some dogs get where they get. Just quite addicted to licking toads. W is a four-year-old crossberry. She's quite a sweet dog. She's very smart. She can be very stubborn as well though. Dobby. She first started chasing toads. Dobby, no. Probably about eight on our nuts of age. That's why we first bought her with one. Dobby, leave it. Dobby. Dobby. Dobby. She tends to get a little pie on them. I hope you'll all die late. She'll act a little bit trippy. She won't want to come when she's called or anything like that. She certainly seems to understand that there are certain side effects of cane toad poisoning. He's happy to deal with the consequences of the hose. This phenomenon of animals deliberately getting intoxicated by cane toads is. just fascinating. It just seems unbelievable that an animal would go back for a second try. Dobby. But nevertheless, we do have many documented cases of patients who deliberately on a regular basis will seek out a toad and they seem to be. able to lick a toad in such a way they only get a very small dose. It doesn't affect her on a day-to-day basis. So I don't think it's certainly. fitting a true definition of addiction. She certainly enjoys it. Dobby. Dobby. Dobby. Dobby. I guess if you're going to Andrew Pemorf ise, it's kind of like an LSD trip. Dobby. Dobby. Dobby. Presumably it must be quite pleasant for the dog. How may do it again and. again and again and again and again. And who knows what's going on in those dogs minds? Dobby. They spend a million dollars trying to eradicate them. There's other people like the Chinese who have been investing in the therapeutic benefits from toads for thousands of years. The very first thing they should do is set up a trial toad fun. And so that venom, you can just milk it by picking it up and squeezing it out of there, putting back in the pan, feeding them up in another few days time. You're going to be ready to milk again. And then we wondered what we're going to do with the rest of the frog. The. Chinese himself would eat the cane toad. Not a problem at all. He's back legs is just like a nutritious green frog to them. They want to bite. They. can't get it. And so everyone could benefit out of the cane toad. I actually like toads a lot now. Before I used to take the air rifle around on Friday night and pop a wall and send them out at the garbage. But I owe a lot to the cane toad. It's been very, very good for me and the family. And so I have much more. humanity towards them now. We called him Melrose. People might say I was crazy, but he was just like one of my kids. Put him on my head and walk around with him on top of my head. Put him on his back and tickling him underneath the throat. He used to worm. him and feed him. Cockroach is nutty. He thrived on him. Then I had his little show pen. There's a swimming pool in that innit. And a little oatening where I used to push the door open. The cockroach's used to come running out. As soon as you heard the rustle, you know it was coming in. You sit there and look up at the door of the cage and his tongue would be. young fifty to the dozen. I tried to get him in the book of records. Back him up and get the world's largest toad. But I overdone it really. I have a feed in him. Because he couldn't hop. In the end he couldn't hop. He used to just crawl. I went to Fady Monday and he was lying in his water. Dead. A heart attack. Just for a little part of me was dead too. I was freezing. I was freezing for quite a while and then I eventually tanned him and then I stuffed him. I wish I was sweating. The marketing stuff was still a little bit up in the air for sojus. But we. decided to approach one of the big hardware chains. They weren't really interested until we had quite a bit of it. We were stockpiling it. The only problem was the batch was still a bit too fresh. It was still fermenting. It was just a gas hazard pressure in the bottle. You could see it in the bottle. They were really tight when you picked them up. One of the truly spectacular things about the cane toad invasion is the. directional nature of the toad front. There are essentially toads that are travelling in a straight line down the road in a consistent direction. The main thing is that toads are looking for a nice flat open linear corridor that will help them head west as fast as they can. We've created those. We call them roads and the toads have taken advantage of them. I know that Darwin for a while there tried to do something about the toads. But they lost interest. They appear to have not continued through. It's all talk. They don't care. I mean, it's not good them sitting down there saying, "Of course we do care.". They've done nothing. They've done absolutely nothing. Government, they've been so quiet. They've really, in a sense, diffused the issue. I'm saying to them, put some money where your mouth is and fix this problem before it does escalate right across the top end of Western Australia and down the west coast because it will happen. The only people making a difference at the moment are the public. They get out there and they collect toads. They're an advancing wall of toads going west in the Northern Territory. And. that's only been disrupted by people. And all we are really doing is buying time for Western Australia. I was asked by Kimberly Toadbusters to become involved for the reconnaissance side of the work. So the volunteer group could get in there and do the mop up work. The highway front line is the one of most concern at the moment because that's where the cane toads are closest to WA. And it's also the path of less. resistance for the cane toads. We have become quite good at identifying daytime refuges where toads will hide under river banks and other locations like that where they can get good shade. At Crock Tank Lagoon, it was quite an amazing sight. It's probably the. largest concentration of cane toads that we've seen in any one small area. The birds will hibernate in these cracking Clay holes. They don't. necessarily need water. So if a water hole is dried up, we can no longer guarantee that the toads have died with it. None of us could believe it. In one night, we pulled out 6,180 toads. It was. like watching a moving carpet. We find cane toads that may be 5-6 years old. They've travelled such a. distance that they've actually worn their toes off on their feet. And they end up having small little stumps. And that gives us a real indication that. these toads have really travelled quite some distance. We are looking at multiple corridors of toads. And if you look at the full length of the West Australian Northern Territory border, it's a pretty large area. We have narrowed those corridors down to 6. Three of those, quite likely, will get across into Western Australia. Not if the kimpy toad busters can help, but I'm not yet. The kimpy toad busters is a 2,500 volunteer group committed to stop the toad. coming into Western Australia. It's a bit like a military campaign, really. I think of those brigades in the desert, even in the Second World War, where. you hear about those ages of them out there against 500,000 on the other side. And it feels like that sometimes. Everyone's geared up because we are working in obviously, snake country, crocodiles, wild buffaloes, wild pigs. It's incredibly dangerous. And if you're with people who are trained and skilled in that wilderness, then you feel very safe. I'm a city slicker, and I remember once I got heatstroke on a trek with her. and she just threw me in a billabong, fully clothed and fed me fruitcake till I've recovered. You're not busting at night. It's always on rugged terrain, so you really. want your hands free if you're a toad catcher. So you go diving for a toad while you're part in the spots that holds the bag for you. And then you go to bed and that might be two or three in the morning, and then you'll get up. I don't know, whenever Lee's got the bacon and eggs on. Kimby toad busting is not just about removing the toads. It's also. understanding their behaviour and it's understanding what we're dealing with. Are we dealing with a male colonising front, or are we in fact dealing with an area where we've got males and females getting ready to breed? So every toad that we remove is measured. It's sexed. One of the difficulties that Kimby toad busters have had is to try and get. scientists to accept that what we are doing in the field is science. They tend to treat our data as anecdotal. They look at the Kimby toad bust a volunteer movement as a bunch of rednecks out there, which of course is not the case. We use CO2 because it's clean and it's a gentle way of doing it and it's very quick. And so the CO2 is pumped into the bag. The bags are sealed off and they are left for about an hour before we actually then Bury them. I'm a bit embarrassed as an Australian that we can't come up with a solution. Yeah, I think by now we should have. We've now got traps. We can divert. them with fences and so forth, but they seem to have as beat on every turn. The next thing on the agenda for the toads is Western Australia and the first thing they come up against is the Ord River System, which is heaven if you're a toad. There you've got a water storage area eight times bigger than Sydney Harbour. They can breed at any time of the year and over there they'll be able to. breed all year because conditions are good. They're just going to love that. So that will be a major battleground between humans and toads there and I hope we can hold them off here as long as possible. It is truly remarkable that despite all of the fantastic activities that can. be undertaken by the human race, the magnificent pieces of equipment that. are being developed, our capacity in space and yet we still haven't come to. find a way to control the cane's home. You're not going to sit the clock back. The toad is now here. You can bash with gloves to be blue in the face. You're not going to make them go away. They've got no place in society. They don't belong to you at all. Tell them why you send them back over there to Barack Obama. The federal government was giving six and a half million dollars to save the. whales. What about helping your own country and eradicate these blasted. animals? We're our own worst enemy, are we? It's not the toad's fault that they came to Australia and caused the death of animals. It's our fault. We brought the toads here to them. It's an alien. country with alien animals and we're the cause. And the cane toad will eventually get where it wants to get or can get and. that's the way it's going to be. It's a remarkable story. There's no doubt about it. This is an epic.
