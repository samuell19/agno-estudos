[calm piano music] [seagulls squeaking] [Shawn] Life never turns out the way you expect. That's one of the last things my grandpa told me. He also told me to always bring an extra pair of pants, whenever we play miniature golf in case I got a hole in one. But I was always very careful. Your profile pictures aren't very up to date. If you didn't see your name, I never would have known that was you. I read an article about how this place used to be an abandoned plant. Until someone realized that it could be something beautiful. [calm piano music] [Shawn] Sorry. Touching can be too intense. [camera clicks] [Shawn chuckles softly] [dreamy music] [sad instrumental music] [upbeat instrumental music] [footsteps] [Ruth] How did it go? She just ran off. Let me guess. You didn't look her in her eyes. - I'm never getting married. - [Ruth] Married? We need to get you a second date. I need to find someone before you die. Well, good news. I'm still breathing. Sometimes to motivate myself, I picture you lying in a casket. [Ruth chuckles] How dare you say that? You know I want to be cremated so no one will screw up my makeup. Maybe I should start picturing you as an urn. [Ruth laughs] Whatever works. Don't ever stop looking for that special someone. She's out there. Every day, I pray that you'll find her. I printed something for you. That'll be you someday. Clint, my man. How's the meat? Wow. Why is this hottie rated a six? She lied in her bio. She says she majored in cosmetology at Harvard, I caught that one. My algorithm - cross checked the way she... - Okay, look. Somebody that looks like this should have a boost to their score. [Shawn] The score is objective. It's her history of how many times she's been... Nobody cares about people's histories if we lose all the young and hot with valid credit cards. Let's find a way to reward this beauty. Oh, I can't get into my personal account. Yes, new rule. Employees are no longer allowed to date through the app. So you can't use it either. Of course I can. - Quality control. - What about Adele? - Same thing. - And Cyrus? Shawn, we've had a few complaints from some of the girls that you've met. All of them, actually, not a big deal. But, uh, you know, maybe we try to date through other apps. I know my chances of finding someone will increase if I can... - I hope everyone's excited about our women haters party. - [Jake] Tammy. Fine, promo party. Some of you need to RSVP today. I didn't get the invite. Sorry, Shawn. Jake's getting picky about who goes. I won't have anything to eat or drink. If that helps. Can't do it, Shawn. When Jake says no, he means no. Kind of like victims of sexual assault. No means no, people. -I'll add you to the list, -But you just said no. [shushes] I hate the theme and object to it on principle, but you're a nice guy. [dance music] [Colin] What up, bro? We're at a Pimps and Hoes party. Why are you dressed like Elton John? What? - You don't look like a ho. - [Tammy] Exactly. Why are we celebrating women being trafficked by pimps? [grunts mockingly] How's Grandma doing? I heard she swallowed a hundred dollar bill. Grandma didn't swallow anything. So there's been no change? Nope. [Shawn] She looked at me. Hey, turn on the charm, smile back. Nah, no. That's like the Cheshire cat. More subtle, look, look. [Colin] No, you're being creepy. That's creepy. Smile long enough to hook her, not make her run away. Three seconds. Turn your head, smile for three seconds and turn back. Yeah, it was awesome. Yeah, yeah. Okay, some of these women might be out of your league. All women might be out of your league. - Don't say that. - Kidding. Kidding. Try your smile out on somebody else. It worked. White is the color of all wavelengths of visible life. People think black is all colors, but black is the absence of color. Uh-huh, I'm violet. Heh, the color on the higher end of the visible spectrum, I'm Shawn. Please say you'll go on a date with me. - We can go someplace right now. - I can't right now. We can do later, but it'll cost you. You're at a Pimps and Hoes party talking to a ho. I'm not good at pretend. Well, I'm good at everything as long as I'm paid by the hour. I used to be paid by the hour. Now I'm on salary. Three hundred an hour. What do you do to earn that much? Like I said, everything. You free Saturday night? What time? For how long? I don't know. Five until eight. You don't want to wait until it gets dark. It's summer in Seattle. The sun stays out forever, like it's trying to make up for the rest of the year. Whatever you say, big spender. Just text me your address. I look forward to going out. Going somewhere is extra. Then we can stay in, have dinner. I'll bring dessert. I like chocolate. Bro, you did it. [calm piano music] [phone vibrating] Hi, Douglas. Send her up. [elevator bell rings] [Violet] Oh, I think, I have the wrong place. [Shawn] Hi, Violet. [Violet] Oh. [Ruth] Hello. Women dress so edgy these days. [Ruth chuckles] [Violet] Will you be joining us? [Ruth] I'll, I'll be in my bedroom. No touching until I say it's OK. - Oh, well, Shawn doesn't like touching, either. - [Shawn] Mm-hmm. And if I don't want to do something, I won't. Oh, well, of course, dear. We all need better boundaries. Well, um, I'm off to my bedroom, and uh, - so you two can get started. - [Violet chuckles softly] [door opens and closes] [Shawn] Oh, you were supposed to bring dessert. - It's right here. - What? [jacket light thud] - Oh. - Um... [chuckles] Dinner Oh, you want the girlfriend experience? As long as it leads to something more. We can role play. Whatever you want. You really like muffins. Those are Apple muffins. Washington's official state fruit. I've got something else you'll find tasty. You did bring dessert. [scoffs] Where's your bedroom? Right down the hall and to the right. Give me a sec. [calm piano music] We should get the business part out of the way first. [Shawn] Business part? Didn't know you were changing. You're new at this? I get it. You booked me for three hours, that's nine hundred, stud. I don't understand. - Are you a cop? - I'm a programmer for a dating app. I turn original formulations into executable programs. I solve problems with algorithms and verify the requirements - of the... - I love to hear more about that later. I really have to show you You're the one who hired me. - Show me whatever you want. - Why would I hire you? You really thought this was a date? What else would it be? What do you think I am? You're a pretty woman. [cell phone buzzes] You're very nice, but I have to go. Car's on the way. - That was too quick. - [Violet] Sorry. - I need to hook up with someone. - I could go with you. You should date someone else. Did I say something to hurt you? Sometimes I do that without realizing it. It's nothing against you. But... But you can't date a guy like me? Not the first time I've heard that. [Violet] Well, it's a short car ride. [upbeat instrumental music] [Douglas] Hey, I've got a box for your grandma. I'll get it on my way back. - She knows you're going out? - Of course she does. I'm on a date. You have a busy schedule. - It's just for work. - What do you do? - I'm an actress. - Oh, wow. - So this is an audition? - Kind of. - How long have you been acting? - Look, you're fine to come along, but can you do a little less of this? Yeah. - [Violet] Have a good night. - [Shawn] I can wait here until you're done. - [Violet] These things could take a while. - [Shawn] I'm fine. - [Violet] You really need to go. - [Shawn] Don't worry about me. - Well, I have your number. - Sorry, I don't... Hugs, they're too intense. Oh, okay. I'll see you around then. [knocks on door] [door opens] [door closes] [footsteps] [somber music] Did you get the part? You're still here? I wanted to hear how it went. Same as always. I just try to get through it. I've got another audition. You're very popular. [Violet] I can't believe you stuck around. [Shawn] I didn't want our date to end. I hardly know you. [Violet] Most people just care about my measurements. [Shawn] We can start with that. How tall are you? [Violet] Five six. [Shawn] What's your favorite breakfast cereal? [Violet] Hmm. The sugar cereals. My mom didn't let me eat growing up. [Shawn] Mine used to be Good Friends. [Violet] That's a cereal? [Shawn] It's the only thing I would eat for breakfast, until I couldn't eat gluten anymore. [Violet] I'm going to make a cereal called enemies so that people can eat them for breakfast. [Shawn] You are? [Violet] Just a bad joke. [Shawn chuckles] [car tires screeching halt] [Violet] You don't need to wait for me. Let's keep this thing going. It shouldn't be long. [somber instrumental music] [boat whirring] [dreamy instrumental music] [Violet] You okay? Just listening to the colors of the bridge. Some of the senses in my brain are mixed up. It's called synesthesia. When I look closely at colors, I hear sounds. What's that sound like? Clang! Not what I thought. [man whistles] Stay here for a second. Productive night, sweetie? You didn't text me back. I'm going there now. Who's the guy? Just someone being nice to me. That's all he had in his wallet. You know, better get back to him. Who is that? He's, uh, my manager, Anton. Helps me get jobs. [cell phone buzzes] [Violet] I've got one more audition. Takes the edge off. [Shawn] You should try chamomile tea. It also relieves cramps. [Violet] I'll keep that in mind. It's the [unintelligible] [electric whirring] You're looking pretty, Amber. Oh, I think I have the wrong place. No, you got the right place. Amber works down at the office. She won't give me a time of day. Just play along. [Colin] So I haven't met a lot of actresses in Seattle. - It's a small community. - [Colin] Huh. How long have you two been friends? [chuckles] Colin is my brother, A very protective brother. Ah, didn't realize it was so late. I want to see you again. [Violet] I wish my life wasn't so busy. Take it easy, bro. Give her some space. I really like you. [Violet] I'll call you, promise. That was four dates. A new record. Yeah, I count that as one date. Look, grandma's been bugging me for a while to help you find someone. Maybe it's time I did. I like Violet. We're going to have a fifth date. I will help you find the right kind of girl, and we'll start with, uh, this. Most of us don't wear the same thing every single day. I mix up the colors. Yeah, you dress like a Lego. Okay, time to dress like a man. I'll forget how to match everything. We will take photos. And maybe do something... I know, I know, I know. Thank you. Someone stole my credit card. You gotta be careful, bro. [Ruth] Ready? I thought Sunday is blue shirt day. Colin says this is better. Did you ask that woman about her family? Her job? - She's an actress. - Wh, what about her church? I don't know. Make sure you read the sell sheet before you buy the house. I'm not buying a house. Besides, she hasn't answered any of my phone calls or text messages. She'll probably just be like everyone else. You know, sometimes we need a little encouragement, so that we don't give up on love. Doesn't seem right for me to wear these anymore. Are you dying? Oh, and I know your grandpa would've wanted you to have it. Therefore, when you find that special person - Thanks, Grandma. - Oh. [chuckles] ♪ Turn your eyes upon Jesus ♪ ♪ Look full in His wonderful face ♪ ♪ And the things of earth ♪ ♪ Will grow strangely dim ♪ ♪ In the light of His glory and grace ♪ Anyone can see it's a moustache, but you can get it lasered right off. Go. Hey, excuse my brother. He can be a little blunt sometimes. Did I say something hurtful? Just try your key, Shawn. Nope. Okay, that one's staying locked. Look, um, just try a couple more locks before we take off. Okay? This may not have been my best idea. - [Violet] Can I talk to you for a second? - Mmm-hmm. I told her to stop by between her auditions. Give us a moment. I got your texts, including the ones about your credit card being stolen. Tell me how you want to work this out. You had it. I thought that's why you texted me. [Shawn] I just wanted you to know what was going on. Maybe you wanted to see me again. Oh, right. I must have grabbed it at the coffee shop by mistake. - I took everything back. - That explains that. [Colin] Can I chat with you for a sec? Hold on Shawn, just... Look, something is off here. I know, your brother is very unique. He has autism. He's high functioning, but it's tough for him to form relationships, communicate, break social cues. I might have that, too. Look, he can be too trusting, too loyal, and when he hurts, - he hurts big time. - [Violet] Hmm. He deserves a nice woman. No offense, but you're not really his type. The only time people say no offense is when they know they're being offensive. - I didn't mean... - I know what you meant. Wanna get a bite to eat, Shawn? Try the key thing. Maybe a muffin. [Violet] Your brother could be friendlier. [Shawn] Sorry about that. Whenever I'm feeling down, this is what I look at. [siren wailing] A wedding app. That one lists everything you need to do to get ready for your big day. I heard of a guy who put out an ad one time that said, "Wife wanted." He got a bunch of replies back that said, "You can have mine." [light chuckle] - Is that a joke? - [chuckles] [Shawn] Colin is better at those. - Inspiring, huh? - Huh. Seeing all those cake photos makes me hungry. I can't eat casein which is part of milk or gluten which is part of wheat. [Anton whistles] Uh, give me a minute. You got me worried when I didn't hear from you, sweetie. No one was lined up, I thought... Let me do the thinking. [Violet] Sorry. I thought I was free today. - There's something wrong with your hand. - Just nerves. I could never be an actor. Expose myself to everybody? - You're brave. - I'm crazy. You're a different wavelength. [inspiring music] What do you mean? There are colors we can't see. Beauty that's outside our physical spectrum. There's a lot about you that's not visible to me yet. But I can tell it's going to be beautiful. I'd like to try that hug again. I can hug you gently. Can you hug me? That's the best I can do. [Violet] How does my necklace sound? [gentle whispers] Like whispers. Since you won't hug me I'll just say it. I want to hug you, Shawn. And it's not an everyday event for me. I've had more touching then I need. I don't know what that means. But I'd really like to see you again. I know. [Colin] Hey. Grandma called me. Now, she doesn't have a good vibe about Violet either. I finally have a relationship and you're both against it. You've seen her two times, that's not a relationship. You can be too trusting and that's how you get hurt. The way she dresses, it makes me think she has a past. And those auditions at night, there, there can't be that many acting jobs in Seattle. At least I'm worried about my future. You're the only barista here with a teaching degree. You should be doing more with your life. And you should be asking her more questions. Get to know her, find out what she really does. Be happy for me. Colin doesn't think someone can be a full time actor in Seattle. I do other jobs to get by. He doesn't even think we should be together. Neither does my grandma. You're an adult. You can choose who you're with. The reason I showed you that wedding app is because I only date someone if she's a possible wife. Oh! Wow. Um, I almost forgot. Since you're so into weddings, I thought you could use this someday, when, uh, some of those colors aren't right to you. Thank you. I should get back to work. I got to go too. Auditions. [Violet] I don't even know this guy. [Anton] That's why we're going out with him. It'll be fun, I promise. [Violet] It's getting late. We should've met him at the club. [Anton] Would you relax, okay? But don't worry about this. [knock on door] [Anton] Come on. Hey, Joe, She's the one I was telling you about. [door locks] Here you go. Bottoms up. Come on, you could do better than that. Bottoms up. Let's go. You know what? Actually, [phew] I forgot something in the car, all right. I'll be back in like, two minutes. - [Violet] I'll go with you. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just hang out here, all right? When I get back, we'll get a bite to eat before we go to the club. - [door clicks open] - Okay, just... [clears throat] So you must have known Anton for a while? [siren wailing] Your wine is a little sour. [glass clinks] I'm gonna wait in the hall. [door clicks open] [Violet] Oh, hey, what's going on? [violet complains indistinctly] [somber music] [inhales deeply] [barfs] [sobs] [Violet cries] [sniffs] [crying] [Anton] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - You okay? - [Violet] Something was in the wine. Your friend was all over me. - [Anton] Calm, calm down. - I'm calling the police. [Anton] Calm down. - Hey, it's all gonna work out. - You don't get... - I was at the door... - [Anton] Just... - Just... No, no, no, no, no. - And he, he's... I know exactly what happened. See this. Mm-hmm. [unintelligible] Looks like you were enjoying it. Come on. Get up. - What the hell is going on? - [Anton] Come on, get up. Come on, that's it. - [Violet cries] - [Anton] Hey, come on. Yeah, that's it. - Mm, take one of these. - Uh... Take one of these, it will make you feel good. - [Violet sobs] - Come on, take the edge off. Let's go. There you go. I have another friend for you to see. - I want to go home. - [chuckles] [Anton] Now it's time for you to pay me back for I've done for you. - Okay. Hey, shush. - No. This is... - insane. -This is... - You're going to make some dough. You're going to make some dough with this next one, all right? I'd hate for your mom and dad to get these pictures, you know, or anybody else back home. Well, no one should see you this way, okay? Look, here's how it works. You pay me back for all I've done for you. You know, keeping a roof over your head. Pretty things on your hot body. Whatever you want. Just till you pay me back. I'll keep these safe and keep you safe. It's a dangerous world. Parents get killed. Friends get killed. No one ever knows. Come on. - [mumbles crying] - [Anton] Come on, let's go. - No, I don't, I don't wanna go. - Let's go! - I... - Let's go. - [crying] - Let's go [cries] I don't want to do this. The doorman had this for you. - Oh. - You get a lot of packages. - You seeing that girl? - You don't have to wait up for me. What's her last name? - I don't know. - Well, you can't go over to her place, if you don't know her last name, - I'll ask. - She's not the kind of girl that, I picture you with. You used to be happy if I was with any girl. Well, I'm not up to having visitors like her around here. - This is my place too. - I only want the best for you. And I don't think she's it. I liked your paintings better when they have color in them. Well, this is the way life feels without your grandpa. I hope my life never feels that way. [footsteps trailing off] [Violet] You're early, very early. I, I forgot to tell you to use the back entrance. I was excited to start our movie night. - You look pretty. - [scoffs] [Shawn] I didn't realize you were just visiting. [Violet] No, this is where I live. I've tried to make it my home. Oh, you have a roommate, [Violet] That's Goldie. - Oh, that's okay. - Clutter distracts me. I'm surprised you're not in a house or apartment. Anton got the place. Worked out a deal. He likes to keep all his actresses together. And he keeps most of what I make. Welcome to showbiz. [scoffs] [Shawn] What's that? [violet] Oh, that's Theo. Every week I stuff ten bucks in him so I could go to a drama school, at the University of Washington someday. [Shawn] It's gonna take a lot of stuffing. I know. Just stupid dream. - [hums] - But Theo keeps me going. - [Violet] It's just a bra. - It gets my heart racing. Nothing wrong with that. There is, if you're waiting until marriage to make love. [chuckles] You don't have to wait. It's a sign that you're bonded and committed to someone for the rest of your life. [chuckles] Or it's a sign you like to have a good time. [Shawn] Are you waiting for that special someone? Did I hurt your feelings? I try to ask that if someone's face changes. [Shawn] You're cute. Are these your parents? - Mm-hmm. - Mm. Where's your dad in this picture? He left us. Fine by me. His brother did things he shouldn't and Dad always denied it. I'm just glad my uncle couldn't get to me anymore. I try not to think about it. It's too hurtful. I've been hurt, too. My parents didn't do so well with their relationship, either. I had to have a lot of sessions with therapists. It was too much for them. So my grandparents took my brother and I in. [cell phone vibrates] My dad says he needs to find himself before he can find us. My grandma says that he'll never find himself at the bottom of a bottle, whatever that means. I'm sorry. Looks like Anton needs me tonight, after all. What do you think? - Gold or pink. - I like the one you have on. It sounds like a heart beating. Maybe that's me. Good night, Violet. Good night, Goldie. Oh, what's your last name? - Black. - Your name is two colors. You told me black is the absence of color. You were listening. [inspiring instrumental music] - [Shawn] How was the audition? - They're all the same. This guy wore his wedding ring. So gross. Why is that gross? Yeah, you're right. It'll be better next time. I created an algorithm that searches for auditions for women in your age range. Lot of modelling opportunities. Shawn, thank you. I'd love to be going for other parts. I just wanted you to make it. [Shawn] Okay, too much. [Violet] You know, it's tough making it to all auditions if I'm seeing you in between. Maybe we shouldn't see each other on my work nights anymore. - I didn't know. I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. [Shawn] You'll get a great role someday. Look, student film, casting female in her twenties. Good looking, to play a woman with a wounded past, multiple personalities. That could be you. I think it is me. A joke. [soft laughter] [cell phone vibrates] - My next audition. - You could skip it. If I do, Anton will find me. Somehow he always knows where I am. - What are you doing? - Turning off your GPS. - That's how he tracks me. - [Shawn] Mm-hmm. I know some fun things we could do. [Violet] Okay. I'll grab my jacket and then we'll have a fun time. [upbeat instrumental music] I promise. [door clicks] It's open. - Where have you been? - I'm sorry I'm so late. - I've got something special planned. - [Violet] Oh. Uh, Shawn, this is Alicia and Nadia. They're friends of mine. I thought you and I were having dinner. I'll share, they were hungry. My grandma's coming home thinking she's having dinner with just me. You were a surprise. All of you would be too much of a surprise. I love surprises, but I wish you told me. I didn't want you to get nervous. You must make a lot of money to afford this place, huh. It's my grandma's. I do coding. Me too. [sniffs] Gets me through the day. You know how to code? Oh, no, I thought you said codeine. - We should do this another time. - Are you all actresses? You're not going to get much from Miss talkative here. - [Violet] We should go, girls. - Wait. - What's wrong? - No, it's fine. I just, I can't miss an audition again or turn off my GPS. Did Anton hurt you? He lost control, happens now and then. - He likes us to be professional. - That's not right. Let's come up with a plan for that special dinner. - [elevator bell dings] - [stutters] [clears throat] [metal gate rattles] [Shawn] How was Bible study? [Ruth] Well, if more women were like the women from the Bible, this world would be a much better place. - [Ruth] The... - Don't blow this for me. - I'm in it for the long game. - I'm not. I think Douglas has some mail for you downstairs. [Ruth] Oh, uh, oh, oh, I thought we were cooking dinner. I'm not ready yet. [Ruth] I smell bug spray or, or is it perfume? [cell phone buzzes] [cell phone buzzes] - We've get out of here. - Just give it a sec. - [Ruth] I hear whispering. - [Shawn] Huh. - What is this? - Put it back. - Is something moving? - [gasps] [soft thud] What is going on? Uh, she was looking at your ant thing and they got all over. Why do white people keep ants for pets? Grandma, you remember Violet? These are her friends. Lisa and Nadia. Is that your real name? Violet? [Shawn] Of course it is, Grandma. Oh, let's hope it is. [snickers] Well, it's uh, more of a stage name. No one uses their real name. What is your real name? It's Olivia. That's pretty. Well, I can't wait to discover more about Olivia Black. - Call me Violet. - [Shawn] That's why I wanted you to have dinner together so you could get to know each other. Did I tell you she wants to study acting at U-Dub? [Ruth] Well, what about your spiritual life? Are you a follower of Jesus? Sure. [Ruth] What's the name of your church? Church of the... Holy Grail. That's great. I didn't know. Well, I think we all should go to your church this Sunday. It's much better than dinner. Or maybe Violet could come visit our church. Oh, I want to go to hers. Who's your pastor? Monty Python? I'd love if Violet could come with us. I'd love to go. Well, you'll have to rethink your wardrobe. - She can dress how she likes. - We need to get going. We'll see you on Sunday. You really like that bow tie, huh? I was thinking maybe we could spend a little more time programming, and little less time trying to be fancy, huh. - I'm hoping to be groom someday. - Let me give you some advice. Love is blind. But marriage, that's an eye opener. [Shawn] Grandma. I told Violet we'd be at church early. Shawn, I can't stand by... as you... [breathing loudly] I'll call 911. [Ruth] It's, it's a panic attack. Just tell me everything will be okay. - Everything will be okay. - You've got to mean it. You're sure this isn't the diabetes? This is how it started with Grandpa. You're making it worse. [Shawn] Everything will be okay. Everything will be okay. - Everything will be okay. - [exhales] We never know when our time will come. What brought that on? [Ruth scoffs] What do you think? Something isn't right about that girl you're seeing. She's a woman. - Let's go now. - [Ruth] Oh, please be sensitive. I need to let this pass. Tell Douglas to hold the car. [Douglas] Now you, uh, sure you all right? You gave me quite a scare. It's still ticking, - but thank you for asking, Douglas. - Yeah. What a beautiful day. I wish I had someone to go for a walk with me when I get off work at five. Hmm. I think you might find someone. [chuckles] This is for you. Oh, and I found this. - I think it's yours. - Isn't that the pin you bought? Thank you, Mrs. Lambert. [Shawn] Who sends you all those packages? Don't worry about it. I'd really like to open it. [sighs] Fine. Thanks. He knows I haven't painted in colors since your grandpa passed away. The doorman's the one that's been sending you all these packages. - He must really like you. - [chuckles] Oh, they're just little gifts, Shawn. Why won't you date him? [sighs] I'm not, we're not... Don't be absurd. He's the doorman. - How do you think it would lock? - Why do you care? Well, at my age, not acting on love is, the closest I'll come to ever living out a Jane Austen novel. Jane Austen? You, you wouldn't understand. I told her we'd be here early. Maybe she came and left. She's probably at her church of the Holy Grail, sitting next to King Arthur. - Maybe. - Oh, girls like her tend to stay away from the light. ♪ Through many dangers toils and snares ♪ ♪ I have already come ♪ ♪ 'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far ♪ ♪ And Grace will lead me home ♪ [woman] I'm sorry. You can't be here. - I'm sorry. I didn't... - [woman] No, this is an exit row. We need to keep it open. Oh. ♪ Amazing grace how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ But now am found ♪ ♪ Was blind but now I see ♪ [cell phone buzzes] ♪ 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear ♪ ♪ And grace my fears relieved ♪ ♪ How precious did that grace appear ♪ Didn't see you come in. - We're up front. - I got called in. - On a Sunday? - Yeah. I wish I could say no. I like that song. Feels hopeful. It's "Amazing Grace." Hmm, really is. A car is coming to pick me. [Shawn] If we were married, you wouldn't have to worry about auditions or money. - [Violet gasps] - [Shawn] I'm serious. I always thought I needed someone to take care of me, but now I can see you need someone to take care of you, too. [Violet] I don't know what to say to that. Am I someone you would marry? Shawn, there's a lot you don't know about me. We can get to know one another, as we spend the rest of our lives taking care of each other. I have a past or the present life. I've been with men before. I didn't wait for marriage. Everyone has a past. But God gives us a new beginning. That's what that "Amazing Grace" song is all about. I've read up on autism, but there's a lot I don't know. I need some help, paying bills, making some decisions. Reading people's faces, maybe what to wear now and then. Though Colin's been a big help in that department. And your family? They would have to accept you if we were married. Your grandma would think I married you for her money. [Shawn] I don't care. Violet, I've been waiting my whole life for that special someone. You've been carrying that around? For when someone's color sounds right to me. That's for me. Will you marry me, Violet? [emotional instrumental music] Marriage didn't work out so well for my parents. We can be different. Marriage is a big deal to me. That's why you shouldn't waste it on someone like me. Loving someone is never a waste. [door closes shut] [emotional instrumental music] I have, I have to get used to that. Of course. Let's do this. [emotional instrumental music] I'm meeting with a therapist to learn how to desensitize. That's great. We're not going the right way. I have a quick condition, first. - But our dinner... - We have time. Unzip me. - How'd you do? - He wants me back. - Wow. - He really likes me. Of course he did. I just have to get these lines done by Thursday. I'm so proud of you. Shawn almost fell in love with a disaster. [chuckles] [Shawn] Colin, Grandma. I'd like you to meet the newest member of our family. We just got married. Tell me you're joking. [Shawn] We're not going to go on a honeymoon right away. I still have to save up. I told him I didn't need one. Shawn, is this a joke? You know, I'm not good at pretend. I figured Violet can stay at our place until we can afford something of our own. Well, it's not our place. It's mine. - And absolutely not. - But she's family now. Oh, I did a background check. Ask her how many times she's been arrested. You've been arrested? I told you I had a past. Well, maybe she can explain to you what it's like to be... arrested for solicitation. Violet, are you or are you not a prostitute? [waiter whistles] - [Colin] Let her go. - Violet. - [Colin] Stop. - She's my bride. Well, your bride is taking my rings - to the nearest pawn shop. - Doesn't make any sense. She got a call back from her audition today. - No, she's being called back to some guy's bed. - Don't say that. - [hyperventilates] - [Colin] Shawn. Who knows how many men she's been with, how many diseases she has. - My God.[hyperventilates] - Grandma. - God. Grandma. - Just tell her everything will be okay. [hyperventilates] Will it? These are lines from her audition today. [Ruth sobs] Violet. - Violet. - [Anton] Go. What the hell are you doing, man? - That's my wife. - A world girl, pal. - [gasps] - Get to steppin' Go. [Shawn cries] [Ruth] We can get it annulled. No one will know it ever happened. I was... -[cries] so stupid. -No, no. Don't, don't. Don't say that. It's hard for you to know who to trust. [heaving] I can't even trust myself. That's why I'm here. You won't be here forever. [paper rustles] What's going on with your algorithms? It's done. That's your score. I'm two. That's great. - Why am I not a one? - Best score is ten. Hmm. Something's off. Analysis questions you answered. How many people rejected your profile online. Wow, you did it wrong. That's an objective rating of your history. Two out of ten. Your time is a complete waste of my money. I don't think so. People should know what they're getting into. Look, I can't keep shelling out money to have you here. I need something that makes our app stand out, not make people feel like crap. And, and never run me through your program again. [Tammy] Don't forget the party tonight. What happened to your wedding pictures? They're just pretend. Everything is pretend. You're not yourself. I thought I found someone. It turns out she wasn't who I thought she was. Everyone hides who they are until they know they're loved. So I thought I did love her. Did you love her for who she is or who you want her to be? [Tammy] Love is like friendship that has caught on fire. Might want to figure out if you're burning. - Burning? - If you love her. [Colin] If she loved you, she wouldn't have gone back to sleeping around. You're right. Look, I will help you find someone that would never cheat on you. Someone you love so much you couldn't stand the idea of her being with someone else. She's out there. Maybe she'll be at the party tonight? Nah, should go by yourself tonight. Okay? You're an adult. Just be careful who you talk to. [dance music] - Where's my Violet? - Busy. Tell her I'm thinking about her. [suspenseful instrumental music] I need to know why you were at the Pimps and Hoes Party. So you could break my heart. Obviously. - You know my boss, Jake? - Sure. We all do. - How well do you know him? - He likes to give his guests encouragement. Me and the girls are very encouraging. I need to know what that means. [Violet] He fixed up with Anton for us to spend time with the parties. Jake thought would be a good fit with girls from the site. He's not that bad. A good tipper. Have you been with him, Violet? It doesn't matter anymore. We're over. - No more using each other. - I didn't use you. I needed a ticket out of here. And you needed a babysitter. I told you not to waste marriage on me. You should have told me what you do. So you can treat me like your grandma does? You lied about the auditions. So I'm not who you thought I was. Time to move on. This is obviously where I belong. I miss laughing with you, talking about the day, having a meal. You'll get over me. Do you miss me? I don't miss any of my clients. I wasn't a client. A non-paying client, the worst kind. Now, please be like the rest of my clients and leave. I thought you cared about me. I thought we had a future. I was playing you. Maybe you'd seen that if you weren't so autistic. [somber music] Your face changed. I got so mad when I thought you had been with Jake. You're not just a replacement for my grandma. [romantic instrumental music] I love you. You're not the first guy to say that. But you're still wearing the rings. And the wedding dress. A girl like me isn't going to wear this kind of dress again. You can't love me after everything I've done. You're my escape plan. My future inheritance. That's all. I don't think that's all. Well, one of us have a special first night. Then you lied about that audition. I just went through the motions with that guy. Buy his time. And after the restaurant, when you ran after me, I couldn't be with anyone else. [Shawn] You got into that car. I pretended that I got sick. Hmm. I've been here ever since, telling myself you're too good to be true. I always thought it would be hard to love someone. To really love someone for real. But [sniffs] I never thought it would be so hard to let someone love me. I've missed the way you see the world, your bad jokes, the way you care about me. - [Violet] They ran out of people. - [Shawn chuckles] In case you want to trace ants together. I wondered if we could runaway together, but... I don't know why I thought my pimp never let me go. When were you going to tell me about your past? When I knew you really loved me, I guess. How can I really love you if I didn't know who you were? Hmm. Gluten and dairy free. This is the song I wanted to play for our first dance.

I can't afford you to be sick no more. Neither can you. Come on. You've got a star client waiting. - The big tipper. - I'm with a friend. Her husband. [Shawn] She doesn't work for you anymore. She's mine until she pays off her debt. [Shawn] Her debt? Yeah. This place ain't cheap. This town is pricey. How much to release her from you? She ain't for sale. You put a price tag on her every night. Five thousand? Ten. Then you'll let her go? Are you serious about this? All right, anybody else gets involved, and you don't see your wife again. Or your fancy grandma. Got it? And you keep her off the streets. For fifteen thousand I'll keep her off the streets under my watchful eye. I'll see you real soon. I love you, too. Are you ready to start the annulment process? Violet and I are going to stay together. I just need to pay her debt so I can buy her back from her pimp. Fifteen thousand dollars. You don't need to buy an impossible marriage. You can get that for free. Grandma, I know you have that kind of money. I can do five thousand but that's taking out cash advances and giving everything I've got. Well, maybe he'll give you a discount. Does he take coupons? [scoffs] I have spent my entire life taking care of you. And you get married in secret. - Without bagpipes. - Bagpipes? You told grandpa that you'd have bagpipes at your wedding to honor our heritage. You wanted me to marry someone who's like a woman from the Bible. - Because you'd be better off. - Rahab was a woman from the Bible. She was a prostitute, wasn't she related to Jesus? And what about Mary Magdalene? She had her issues and she saw Jesus rise from the dead. Please. If God can help someone who isn't perfect, which is all of us, then why can't you? I think it's because you don't want to love anymore. - Now you're being mean. - [Shawn] "I have never been in love. It is not my way or in my nature and I do not think I ever shall." Jane Austen said that. I looked it up. I was joking when I said I wanted to live like one of her novels. Well, the joke's on the doorman and on my wife, and on your colorless paintings. You're late for work. And you better bring back my rings. [Shawn] Who put all my stuff in this box? I hope you have more luck finding your next job, then you've had finding your next date. You didn't get the message? I think we should ask people where they're going, who they'd like to be with, create algorithms based on their answers, make scores about the future instead of the past. We need people looking not finding. Finding is bad for business. This will keep them looking for someone who matches their destiny score. It'll be unique to our app. I could run you some examples... I think you need to concentrate on your own destiny, Shawn. And I need help with Violet, who you hired for your parties, to get her out of prostitution. I bring in performers now and then. What they do in their own time is up to them. [Shawn] If you loan me ten thousand against my future salary, I can buy back violets freedom. Future salary? Shawn you don't work here anymore. I'm not going to tell the police unless you do it again. What am I supposed to do? Hire clowns for my parties? - Clowns are not sexy. - Your business is growing. Maybe you can find a place for them here. You know what? I hired entertainers, nothing more. Get to work on this "destiny score" okay? I want to see some examples. I'm proud of you for standing up to Jake. He's a work in progress. You don't know what he's been doing. [Tammy] I'm working on him. Just... I'm working on him. I want to be with Violet. - I know she'll need counselling, and... - [Colin] You got me in trouble. My manager saw me texting you, and I told her about your crazy idea to buy Violet back. It's not crazy. Yeah, well, my manager didn't think so, either. She told me that the beans from some of our coffee come from a town where the profits help keep women out of human trafficking. Made me realize that I could help someone who needs their freedom. This is for Violet's debt. That's two thousand. That's all I have. Why does your face look like that? You've never hugged me, bro. It's worth it. [Shawn] I have over half. [door shuts] Mmm. The light's too bright. Okay. You all right? [Violet] Hmm. [Shawn] Where's Goldie? In a better place. Oh, I thought I cleaned all that up. What happened? Wedding gift from Anton. - I'm calling the police. - [Violet] No, please. The police put girls like me behind bars, not the guys who pimp us. Anton would make the girls and I pay for that. Maybe he'll take what I have. That's so sweet. But even if you had everything, he'd kill me before he'd let me go. I overheard him talking to a gangbanger about moving us to Portland. I'm glad I could see you before he did. You're coming to my grandmother's home. That's the first place he'd look. [scoffs] And I don't think she'd exactly put out the welcome mat. My brother's place, then? Girls have tried to run away from him before. He works with other gangs, they track women down, then they go missing. You should leave before he comes back, before it gets worse. Not without you. As long as he thinks we're together, he'll know how to find me. Then we'll have to make it seem like we're not together anymore. Like we broke up. Sweetie, the case is over. You're right. He needs to think we're over each other. Get out! Don't you get it? It was all a lie. You're just another John. - [whispers] Tell me you love me. - I do love you. [Violet] You don't know what love is and I am done selling mine to you. [softly] Go over there. I'll slap you. - Too painful, can't handle pain. - Shush. - I'm very sensitive. - Just, just turn your head and think of a painful time so it feels real or pretend. - That's, that's method acting or some [unintelligible] - Okay. [Violet] I never want to see your face again. We're finished. Over, done. - Go away. - [Shawn] I wish I never met you. - [slap] - Ahh. I never want to see you again. You're bothering my sweetie? We're finished together for good. [Shawn grunts] We're over. He gets, he gets it. He was just leaving. Got my fifteen g's on you? [whack] [Shawn groans] He gets it. I don't think so. Something wrong with the way this one thinks. [Anton] It's like I'm beating a freaking kill here. [groans] [beating continues] [Anton] Oh, what's this? A going away present? Hmm, nice. Time for you to go away. [Shawn groans] [Anton] Go out the back exit, don't cause a scene. You've got a guy coming up. He doesn't care what you look like. Just wants it dark. All right. No faces. Anonymous. I'm, I'm still sick. I need a doctor. I tell you what you need? Now get the freaking lights off and I'm gonna bring him up right now. [Anton] And take off that toy ring. [door opens and closes] [dramatic music] [knock on door] [Ruth] Good night. - What happened? - We were in a bad part of town. We'll be all right. - Have you called the police? - We did everything we could. - There must be more to this. - Well... I wondered what Violet saw in her pimp. Then it hit me. [Shawn laughs] Look at the colors on my face. What do you hear? [grunts] [Shawn] Trouble. [laughs] I got my wife back after all. How did I do it? - Beats me. - [both laugh] You've clearly suffered brain damage. Shawn, please go to the bathroom and wet a washcloth and bring back a glass of water. - All right, I can do that. - [Ruth] No, no, it's fine. Ten thousand dollars, if you leave my grandson and Seattle and never come back. Mm-hmm. I heard you wanted to go to the University of Washington. What's their school color? Um, that's right, the violet. How would Violet like to be a violet? Just leave Shawn alone. Their color is purple. And I know marriage won't be easy. I need counselling, rehab, but we're in this together. Twenty thousand. I once thought I wanted your money. But now I see my husband is priceless. I know what's important to you. [cell phone rings] [Ruth] Um, hello, Douglas. It's rather late. Just a moment. There's an Anton here to see you. [stutters] Douglas, um, we're not having visitors tonight. Please show him out. [Ruth] Who was that? Violet needs to stay here tonight. - I'm getting worried. - We just need to figure some things out. You can sleep here tonight. But tonight only. We need to call the police. They won't do anything. When I moved here, I had no money and Anton took care of everything. He'll say, I was paying him back. You don't pay someone back with your body. You think I wanted to? Come on, you can do better than that. Bottoms up. Every time I tried to stop, he told me he'd kill me if I didn't keep going. - [cries] - So sorry. I, I, I found out later the guy from the hotel did that as a service with different gangs. That's how they break you. [sobbing] Looks like the police have a special squad that help with human trafficking cases. - I was paying a debt. - [sighs] Human trafficking is the trade of humans for the purpose of forced labor, sexual slavery or commercial sexual exploitation. Thank you, Mr. Google. Anton is downstairs. - I'll talk to him. - No. - He'll never leave us alone. - That's how he talks. Douglas, please make him go away. You can send a text to get help. Looks like they have rehab and other services. Your pajamas look a lot like what you wore yesterday. I, I might have something that fits you. I need to pick up a few things back at my place. You can't, you can't go back there. Anton doesn't control me anymore. You thought you could still get back here without saying hello? You got a backlog of customers just waiting to get a taste of you. I've, I've worked for you long enough. [Anton] And you keep coming back. You know what? I think you might need a little taste of some. Huh? Whatever you want. You need a little pick-me-up? Mm? You want something stronger? More? Done. But you still have a debt to me. You only counted everything as a debt to keep me in this life. - You all just do what I had to do. - [Violet] What about Alicia? Nadia? When is their debt going to end? You know, they've never had it so good. And you, I always treated like family. You know what? Let's get you back online. But this time, I'll let you pick who you meet with. Well, within reason, of course. You're a small operation, I'm moving on. Look, I got a meeting with the Westside Gang. We're gonna partner up. They've got a lot of connections and some feel good meds. You'll like it. [sighs] The band's gonna be hot tonight. I came here to prove to myself I'm free from you. Only think you proved is just how stupid you really are. I'm smarter than you think. [door opens] [dramatic music] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son. God is a giver. He's a generous guy. There's nothing you can do to add to that generosity. In fact, you could say it this way that there is nothing you could possibly do in your life, that could make God love you more or less than he does right now. ♪ Thou hast taught me to say ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ ♪ It is well with my soul ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ ♪ With my soul ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ ♪ It is well with my soul ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ ♪ It is well with my soul ♪ [knock on door] I saw you at church. Between that and counselling I'm a walking wound. A healing wound. I'd love for you to sit by me next time. We'll see. That looks pricey. It's called designment. I wanted you to have something to wear while I saved up for a real one. [Violet] Thank you. Your friends are here. [Violet] What friends? Did you invite someone? [Nadia] We're out on a day pass. - From jail? - No, grandma, from rehab. [Douglas] Delivery. - [chuckles] What's going on? - Scottish afternoon tea. These shouldn't be served from a box. These are for you. I wish I could paint like that. Maybe grandma could teach you. [Ruth] Delicious. [Shawn] I think we should go to Gasworks Park tonight. [Violet] Hmm. I rather stay in. [Shawn] You know what I love about that place? People thought it was worthless... Until someone realized it could be beautiful. Actually, I was going to say until someone realized that all they needed was a new start. - Oh. - We need a new start. - We got one. - Not for everything. What are you doing? Now that I know you, all of you, will you marry me? I thought we were married. Yes or no? Yes. That car is for you. [Shawn] I hope you still like surprises. Well, dearly beloved, we're gathered here today in the sight of God, to witness the joining together - of Shawn and Violet in Holy Matrimony... - Oliva. It's Olivia.
