Horrible, have you heard about What? about Ooishiuchi After departure, he occupied Oshima's home Really? Then what about that sword?

You cannot do this You, get out Can some body go and save her? Listen to me, I have long searching for you Then Dad, I will be back soon Good morning! where is Iuemon He has been out What's this? It seems like herb You are really smart! Izumi what are you saying, Takuetu The point is not what I said Three days, without any interval He got ferocious look just like he is a cock We can easily get embroiled I understand that It make no difference if you don't know. It is enough Hey, Izumi. Why do you like such a man? I'm good at observing and I find he may be much better than I. but, you are a good-looking guy the one who can attract many girls. It must be happy to be with you Ah, is it? Then it is enough Izumi What are you doing?

Let him go He will leave by soon What do you mean by soon? Let us talk about it later Hurry, keep off, keep off What a really pretty girl It is such a pleasure to drink with pretty girls Then come to my home Absolutely impossible The lady is attending ceremony I will not forgive you in case of any accident Keep off, keep off, don't have a finger in the pie Ouch! Who are you? come here. Come here Kill it flee! flee! The dog was killed by Asano. To big extent it has been proved the relation of the died didn't give Asano's family any compensation But monsignor, the reward for the tidy and neaten of the gundog's body of Iori for hamauls and me should be afforded by the relations of the died The total sum is twenty gold coins That's enough, that hunt dog crazily ran into the house of Asano's house causing some serious damage. They are responsible for this all It is the monsignor who should shoulder this heavy task Why will the victims like us take the responsibility of this? I want to see your cock. It just make no difference. Ok, this is the end. Twenty gold coins is is an unusual large amount for a loner with the little income we earn every day. Then it is your fate to do drudgery your entire life. Drudgery! After all, you have twenty days to collect the money. Only then can we discuss any more. You must give it out by that day Did you hear me? What kind of hunt dog, can we obey this kind of person anymore? Collect twenty Liang gold coins in twenty days No one here have such big amount of money Maybe pay a visit to Ooishiuchi is a better choice They just want us to crouch the head day after night and let others laugh at us Their cruelty surprised me. Maybe Ooishiuchi will give us a hand I would rather not go Why? That's because we only live on his money And if so, Iuemon and I will both get involved. Is that the guy who wants to revenge? First think of those related people What a fool! What an interesting place! You fell into the pond and nearly died as well as drink so much water Hurry, hurry. Bring the dishes here to Mr. Da Shinei Ah, no, we don't need that. Cheers! Ooishiuchi, our fate is in the Jianghu period I know, I know No, you don't understand. Please listen to us seriously So noisy, I will probably catch cold. It seems that you drank much water and you sneezes so often. Ooishiuchi, Ooishiuchi Ooishiuchi, this is one important thing. You must listen carefully. What's up? Ukihasi died What?! When? Before he died he used the knife on him to killed the girl named little O Sorry, Ooishiuchi It's high time I went. The reason for my death is in the last year there is nothing but hatred in my heart. But, I, Ukihasi, am really distressed. In this money-depending era I gone with the gril I know well and her 17 years old adolescence Say bye When mum is attacked again, take off my sweater I left to you. It is my hope that you put it on instead of me Ukihasi, Ukihasi Dad Ukihasi paid a visit to you yesterday, didn't he? Yes. What for? to borrow money. Then, what do you say to him? I asked him the money he borrowed was for living or lechery. He said it was for living. So, I said I would lend you money for the later purpose. I won't lend you money for living. Why? If it was for lechery, both the debtor and the creditor will forget soon. But, if it was for living the case is different, it will bundle him all life. That will be painful and finally will result in treachery I wouldn't see the Ukihasi like that So I told him that I can't lend him the money. Then... Then, Ukihasi He said he understood And, in fact, he confess that it was not for living, but for those girls he was infatuated with. He regret that he lied to me, but he laughed and said "it is my fault" as he went away That's the face I will never forget Dad, it is you who killed Ukihasi If you had lend money to him at that time, Ukihasi would be still alive. What I said is true, isn't it? Dad! Did you forget something? No. I have nothing to say Dad, dad You will lend money for entertainment, but not for living. Is it? This is the words of those who didn't live in difficulty I have one request one request ... What ? Excuse me, is that Mr. Iuemon? What? No, ah! yes. This guest want to meet you. Are you Iuemon? You drove those guys away in protection of girls in the day You saved my little daughter, thank you so much! This is my honoraria. Please accept it. And for that unexpected misery, please accept those money for bury Then you are? Ah, sorry for late introduction I am the successor for Kanhei Jokokawa. We are responsible for the strange vagrant on the street. My name is Kinobyoue Ioto I am here to see if it is true Hey guys, Can I help you? Thanks but I can not accept it Please take it back Why? My father and I with you are like oil with water. So, I can not accept your money. What happed to those guys? It is far beyond my expectation. Please, take it back You won't accept, will you? Then, it is unnecessary to talk with you. My little daughter and I seldom contact with you. It is regretful. Please take all this away. Hurry, hurry, and take it away What are you doing? There is still one gold coin. What? Sorry. It is up to you. Sorry for keep you worrying me. In any case, I can collect the money by doing drudgery. But, Ooishiuchi, can you raise so much money in so short time? Yes, at any expense I will handle the problem at that time But, how? You can trust me We are both vagrant! Horrible, there is blood on your clothes. But, we finally collect twenty gold coins. Iuemon, you don't feel heart burned? every one is sure to have such feeling, after killing some one. Isn't it true? We should get it as soon as possible. If not, it will?? Good noon! You are all wet. Hey, it has been repaired. Nice! What's in that bag? I am on the way to be a mother My baby will be born in next summer. If I keep on working, it would do harm to my baby and he also want to be born at home. You also want to see him, don't you, dad? So I... Move back Please wait Who is the father? It is you, of course. Don't cheat on me. You have many guests other than me I didn't remember that. But, you are the father Do you have any evidence? It is your baby, actually. As the mother, I know it. Get out of the way. Do you know what revenge is? Revenge? Do you know Takuminokami Asano? No. then what about KotsukenoSuke Kira? No. Tomorrow is the time I will revenge on them. Asano's hari-kari was all because of KotsukenoSuke's compel. So we should twist off his neck now! Why? That is the spirit of cavaliers. It is better to be innocent So what will happen to that spiritual leader? If he understands this, he won't sit idle and only eat Then? His head will be twist off, or he will be executed to decapitation. Why? Why? That's because the father of Kira's father is a wealthy landlord. It is the right time to kill Kira. As they were both out it will be good for us all to do it as quick as possible. No, no, I don't want that Then I can do nothing if you are not willing to do this. That?s the fate for you and me Please wait. Please wait. I feel disgusted to see you There are some messages come from Kouen. there are about 3 or 5 hundred people gathered in that temple. Thus, we can establish our own force. What about then? We are here to think of a name for the sake of raising some tools and money. Those who want to revenge please gather at Maruyama's. Horrible will keep all the repairing fees. It is our revenge day today! I will meet with them later. We'd better set out quickly. We will meet later, Iuemon What do you plan to do today? Ah? We should go You mean? Can, can I go? You want to flee? Then, what should I do, from now on? Flee? Why? You want to revenge so much, don't you? Don't say that again. I am the person bound to die If I cast poison to Jokokawa, then he is sure to die. That's too bad Do you dissatisfy with something? Iuemon I understand. That's the thing you decide, I won't even say a word. Nothing to say. It is me to save you It is our fate when we can't move. It is by our hands to create such well-off live for them. Such person like me. Don't you understand? Smile, please smile. It is the era that transformed us. Yes, it is the era that transformed us That's right. In this year there is nothing inconceivable other than this. Oshima had said it that we should be able to understand our feeling one year later. Stay there! I knew that one day he would betray on me. He is incorrigible, I can do nothing. But why he feel angry about me? That's because in the last year, he witness the expansion of my hatred. Get out of the way! Does such revenge worth of my life? Iuemon Is it laughable? Is it ridiculous? You, laugh Laugh! Do you laugh? you bitch! No, I do not want to see you to die. Please, please, stay with me I will serve me whole heartedly and would prevent you from any danger. I come with money. Thought it is not a big sum, but it is for you all. So, so do not revenge anymore! Ok, I understand, I won't do it anymore and I will stay here. No revenge anymore. And so please stay with me. Iuemon, Iuemon... Today is en end to your drudgery, and those friends on the same camp should get united. There is no room for discussion, if there is some one imitating working in the storeroom. But there is only one left and we should kill Kanhei Jokokawa. This is a thing affording general satisfaction?? Those endless greetings should be reserved. The first thing we should do is to blame one person. What do you think about? Every body has opinions? Done now. What? The clothes for the baby. is it cute? Where are you going? Where are you going? Highness, Iuemon. Your highness, Iuemon. I doubt that there are some trap waiting for you or not. So, please don't go back tonight. Please come to our house in any case by Lunar May the 8th. It is a dark and cold night. In the name of justice, convoluting around the mansion. Among them there are two young men. Knowing the task is dangerous, they still come at last. This is our justice! And we are here to kill them. Leaning against the shoulders of our fathers, We should drive the entire enemy away. That's good, this, this ... Sorry for keeping you waiting Then, I can express slowly about the disrespect last time. Ah, please sit here Hey, look this is little gold coin This is really good luck What are you soliloquizing? Let me tell you, from your husband I took some little thing. My husband? Yes. We meet unexpectedly on the street just now This is catholicon which can guarantee the safety of foetus. He said that he had something to see to and can not come back right now So he asked me to bring this back for him. You can have a look now. Really? Great, I am so happy! Wine can help people out of pains, as well as it is also a luxury for soldier. The two brother of us, as the leader of our cavalier, are here to outguess the nature of war and get rid of our fear. We should maintain a peaceful mind and bring all these to the world of happiness. Let them know our strength.
