NETFLIX PRESENTS It's the end of the world, good God! Dear Lord, please save us. Come on! Calm down, calm down. Mom, faster! Here we go. We're almost there. We're almost there. She's giving birth! Is there a doctor available? No... But I am here. The baby is coming! Is there a doctor? All right, this way! - Come on, do it. You're doing great. - Push now! Push! Push! Push as hard as you can! Push! Push, one more time! Come on. - Come on, madam, push! - Push! Push! Here it comes! Is he an angel? Mom, my son is an angel! Cut it! Where are you going? Madam, you can't just leave! At least give me your personal information! Madam! Mom, what do you think? Maybe if he eats, he won't float. What? What do you say? You won't float, right? Natalia, once and for all... will you tell me who the father is? I've already told you, Mom. I don't know. Is the father, at least, someone normal? I wish I knew... This baby cannot go out. Oh, my God. It might be dangerous. Let's not just wake him up. Oh, my God. It feels like we're in an American movie. I want to name him Oscar. It sounds American and it sounds important to me. No. Are you really concerned about his name now? This is a sign from God... to punish us. Because you like to sleep around. Having a child at your age? Hello, Oscar, Mommy's little sweetheart. Mom, I was thinking... maybe he really is an angel. Angels are real, aren't they? Maybe Dad sent him to us. He looks like Dad. It would have been nice to call him Attilio. Go figure. Those four gossipmongers. What's the problem, Mom? They want to see the baby. You're an idiot. A total idiot. An idiot daughter and a flying grandson. Poor me. Do you have any idea what would happen in our town if they found out about him? ♪ Boys, boys, boys ♪ ♪ Boys, boys, boys ♪ ♪ Boys, boys, boys ♪ Oh, my dear, Attilio. Please help me. A boy or a girl? A boy! Congratulations, Alina! Best wishes! Who would have thought? At your age... Thank you, thank you. They're in there. Come in, come in. May we come in? Come, come in. Sorry for the mess. Sorry for the mess. How wonderful, Natalia. He's beautiful. He looks just like his mom. - No. - What do you mean, no? You can't touch him! The chief physician forbade it. He was born very frail, you know? What a shame. Come on, now. Let him sleep. Goodbye. Mom, Dad's belt worked. We need to get to work, Natalia. Good morning, Alina. Good morning, my dears. How is our baby today? When will you take him out? Some fresh air might do him some good. We can't, we have found out that... He has allergies. Yes, severe allergies. He's allergic to what? To the sun! Oscar, come inside! Sweetie? Come on, sweetie. Let's try this on. Sweetie! Come on! Come. Let's see. The other arm. How does it look? Let's see. Let's close it. You look very handsome. Do you see what I put on here? Do you like it? Yes, Mom. Mom! Mom! The problem is not the arms or the legs. It's here! I told you it would work. Now, my little man can go to school. No. No, he won't! We've already had this discussion. Yes, I can, Grandma. Mom said I can go out now. No. You're staying inside with your mom and your grandma who love you very much. Yes, great idea. So he can grow up as ignorant as we are and spend his life cleaning and mending clothes. Oscar, walk. Show your grandma how good you are at it. Come on, walk. Good. That's enough! Stop it! Don't you understand what you're doing? Take that off, you're not going to need it anyway. I'll teach the boy everything he needs to know. And then, God said to Noah: "I am going to put an end to all people for the Earth is... is..." Go on, you read it. "Is filled with violen-se because of them." Violence. - "Is filled with violence." - Hello. Mom! Can I watch Batman? No, Oscar, we haven't finished. - How long have you been studying? - For ages! What are you talking about? It's only been a couple of hours. Come on, then! Today, Grandma and I will cook something special. And my Oscar can go and watch Batman. Yes! That's enough! Enough! Enough with the damn TV! He doesn't learn anything from it. I'll throw it out, I will! I'd better go... Mom, will I be able to jump like Batman? Of course, but when you're grown up. Batman flies like me, doesn't he? Yes, like a real superhero. Then why can Batman go outside, but I can't? Any idea what Joker has in mind this time? Normal criminals usually follow logic. But Joker's crazy plans only make sense to him, Alfred. Alfred, we need to hurry! Here they are! Now, the lady is going to stop to talk to the other lady and they'll prepare a plan to destroy us! "We must stop Bruce Wayne!" "Yes, we must. See you later, miss." There are three of them, Alfred! The Penguin sent them. Ah. There are only two of them today! I must go and free the world from violence and darkness! Oscar? We're back! Come to Grandma and bring the book! Oscar... Oscar! My God, Oscar! Oscar! It fell, Mom. I'm sorry. I have nailed the window shut in there. Now, I'll nail this one as well. You're going over the top, Mom. He's just a kid, he gets bored. We should allow him to go outside. Why are you being so stubborn about it? He'll be with me. He'll be safe. This child will never be safe outside. Don't you understand? And you'll go with him? You'll keep him safe? You and your dumb mind? Let me get on with it. No! I'm his mother, do you hear me? That's enough. Mommy's going to take you outside tonight. Have you gone mad? Don't you dare... Let's go. - Are you cold, sweetie? - No, no. Sweetie. You mustn't talk to anyone, is that clear? Do you remember Batman? The cartoon you're always watching? Batman never tells anybody that he's a superhero. Batman never reveals his secret. Good. Let's go. ♪ I'll fly with you ♪ Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. ♪ Every day and every night ♪ ♪ I always dream that you are by my side ♪ ♪ And I'll fly with you ♪ ♪ I'll fly with you ♪ ♪ I'll fly with you ♪ There. Wait for me here, sweetie. Just stay here. Good morning. Good morning. - Here. Thanks, ma'am. Anything else? - Yes, I want some cookies. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - I'm sorry! - Why don't you look where you're going? Sorry, I didn't see you. Well, to make up for it, you'll help me carry the water! I can't leave. My mom is at the fruit shop. It doesn't matter! Help me! Here. Let's go! I think I'll get a couple of kiwis for Oscar. Okay. Hurry up! My name is Agata, just like the beautiful and colorful gemstone. What's a gemstone? You're really silly. My mom chose my name. Her name was Sara and she was also beautiful. Is your mom beautiful? Yes, my mom... Mine was so beautiful that Jesus made her fly up into the sky to be with him. She flew away? Who told you that? My grandmother. She flew up to Jesus. And now she's in heaven with the angels. What class are you in? Are you in class A or class B? I don't know. Don't you ever talk? What's your name? Oscar. Where do you live? At home with my mom and grandma. What about your dad? I don't have one. Don't be silly! Everybody has one! I don't know. I just don't have one. Don't tell lies. People who tell lies aren't the children of Mary. They aren't the children of Jesus, and when they die, they go down there... down to that old man called the devil. Do you understand? Yes, yes! Do you like that Batman backpack? Too bad it's really expensive. Come! Are you already tired? I wish I was like Raffa. Who is Raffa? She's a diva, of course! Raffa's so beautiful. As soon as I grow up, I'm going to buy earrings just like the ones she's wearing. I'll sit in the bar like a real lady and drink coffee, and everyone will go... "Good morning, Ms. Agata. Good morning." Come on! Come on, we're almost there. This is my house. You can give me the water now, I have to go inside. I can't. The water. I can't. Why not? No, I can't. Yes, you can. Give it to me! No! Look at what you've done... Oh, my God. Superman! You are Superman! No, I'm not! Help me! Hold me tight! Yes, yes. Wait for me here. No, no, no! Take this! Take it! It doesn't have Batman on it, but it's nice anyway. So, what else can you do? Can you smash a mountain with one punch? No. Can you become invisible? No, no. So you're only a half Superman, then. Do you promise me that you won't tell anybody? I promise I won't tell anyone. Give me your pinky. I swear, I swear, I swear! Oscar! Where have you been? I've been looking for you all day! I told you to stay there! What if you'd flown away? Do you know that Agata's mom can fly, too? Who's Agata? Agata's my friend, Mom. Look, she gave me her backpack. - You didn't tell her anything, did you? - No. Sure? Sure. Natalia, look what I found... Oscar. Where have you been? He got lost. No, no, no. All of this isn't good for someone my age. Come on, Mom. Sit here. No. Oh, Lord. What's that? I got it for him this morning at the market, Mom. It's pink. Yes. He liked it. Nowadays, boys like pink too. Like Wanda's son. A lot of things have changed since your day. Whatever. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom or else... Promise your mom that you won't frighten her like that again. I promise. Come in! Hello, Agata. Good morning, ma'am. Come in. - Batman! - Batman! One, two, three, freeze! One, two, three, freeze! One, two, three, freeze! Hey, that's cheating! Morning. Good morning, ma'am! What a beautiful princess we have here. Good morning, Rosa. Good morning, Natalia. Oscar! I don't want to be an angel! I'm Batman! Come on! Mom, this costume sucks! Oscar, don't say that about the costume your grandma made for you. - I don't want to go out like this! - Come on, let's go! - No, I don't want to! - Goodbye, ma'am. Bye, Grandma. Bye, I'll be right with you. And don't run like that, you'll fall and get dirty! Mary be praised, that girl's a tornado! She's a sweetheart. What? She's a handful. You're lucky! Oscar is a real angel. It's so sweet when they're in love at that age. Do you know what she told me the other day? "Grandma, I like Oscar... because he's just like a real superhero and he can fly!" What an imagination she's got, my Agata! Well, I'm going to see what they're up to. Shall I bring him home for dinner? Yes, yes... All right, bye. Goodbye. Come down! Push yourself, Oscar! Come on! Good morning, ma'am. Oscar's not here today. Where is he? He's out with his grandma, I'm sorry. - Was someone at the door, Mom? - No, there was no one. Good morning, ma'am. You can't go out today. No! I want to play with Agata. Good morning... No. You told her your secret. It's not true, you're a liar! You're going to hell! Good morning. Did something happen? My Agata won't stop crying. I'm sorry, Rosa. Oscar is doing his homework. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Did you hear that, stubborn girl? He's not mad at you. Oscar is just doing his homework. Just like you should. But, Grandma, Oscar doesn't go to school! What do you mean, he doesn't go to school? Good morning, ladies. Oh, good morning, madam. Are you the boy's grandmother? Yes, yes, yes. Oh, my God. So, I've been hearing that the boy does not go to school? I'm sorry. Who told you that? I'll ask the questions here if you don't mind, madam. He's... He's not well. Marshal, he's... he's very frail. If the child is ill, he needs a medical certificate. I told you we should have gone to the hospital, Mom. She doesn't know about these things. She's old, and I'm at work all day. Yes, I'm not that knowledgeable about those kinds of things. Well, in the meantime, the boy must attend school. Yes, absolutely. You're right. You want to go to school, don't you? We'll get everything sorted out tomorrow. Right, Mom? Yes, of course. Absolutely. Okay. When we come back, I hope we'll see this lad at school. Yes, of course. I'm very sorry. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Marshal. Have a good day. You too. Goodbye. Those damn... So I do have to go to school, Mom. Sweetie... next year, you will start attending school. No, Grandma. I can't go to school. You're right, honey. Superhumans... don't go to school. Don't lock the door, Mom. Who do you think is going to come here? All right, never mind, there was no reaction. Seventy-five books are a lot for the Paradox of Abandonment, which has been with us since the beginning. You still didn't manage to solve the mystery behind this definition. Let's see if you will succeed today. Please call 063723043. So let's hear today's first two calls. Hello! Good afternoon, I'm Giulia... Thank you. Hey, Backpack. You're zoning out? I didn't see you. Ah, Martina. All right. Martina! The next time Backpack sits here in front of you like this, take that bottle of grappa over there and make him drink the whole thing. It's on me! What are you saying? To pussy, Backpack! Hi, sweetie. Have you come down for the fair? No, Mom. I just came to pick you up. I'll tell you why he came down. Why don't you stay here with them? You can all go to the fair together. Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe another time. Let's go, now? Yes, all right. Bye. You should read this book, Mom. It's about... a place where everyone suddenly goes blind, except for one woman who... Sweetie! Why don't we go to the San Sebastiano fair? It's just full of mountain people, Mom. Come on, let's go! There'll be fireworks, dancing... It's always the same old thing. We've been going there for ten years. We might have fun this time. Yeah, sure. I would have a lot more fun if I could take off my backpack... Not this story again. Forget it. Hey. Easy. Hey. Don't worry. Come here. Hi. "In that... moment... with his... trot... trott... tro..." Trotting. What kind of fucking word is that? It's like walking... with a hop. I'm fucking tired of these weird stories about weird people. You know what I liked? The illustrated Bible. But that was when you had just started. Yeah, but it was easier. This stuff is torture! You'll see how great it is when you start to read the most difficult things. There are a lot of beautiful stories waiting for you to read them. Right... But not now, okay? Let's go have a drink. - My ass has gone flat! Let's go. - All right. Let's go! For fuck's sake, Backpack! If you don't take that pink thing off, you've got no chance of ever getting laid! Come on! Come on! - He passes again to Marchisio. - Pass! - To the left, he crosses... Di Natale! - Pass, he's free! Pass! Pass! No! Seriously! Come on! Corner kick! Quagliarella in the area, Cannavaro is coming, too. Are we winning? The score's zero to zero, Mom. Andrea Cossu, from the corner... Everything's okay now. I left the keys upstairs. - He turns well, then to Chiellini... - Shoot. Shoot, shoot! Shoot! No, for fuck's sake! The antenna on the roof has moved again! All right, Backpack, let's go and take the ladder so we can fix it. We don't need the ladder. Really? I'll just fly onto the roof... like Batman. No, Oscar. Why? I am like Batman. Like Batman! Batman! This one is soft in the head! You're soft in the head! Completely nuts! You were scared, weren't you? I wonder what they'd say if they knew. Stop talking nonsense! Come on, why? Can you imagine? "Ladies and gentlemen, here's... the living miracle... Oscar Clerichetti!" The world is not the way you think it is. Somebody could write a book about me, Mom. I already have the title for it: Oscar, the Miracle! Enough, let's go home, you drank too much. Enough. Lifestyles or nothing... Extraordinary Men is back! After the great success of the previous editions in Paris, Rome, Madrid, and London, Extraordinary Men has come to the finale in Brussels. Do you think you have a unique talent? Do you think you are an extraordinary man? Then contact us! What are you waiting for? Call the number now. Your dream can come true in Eurovision! Extraordinary Men is waiting for you! I'LL CALL YOU SOON. SORRY, MOM. Incredible. Absolutely extraordinary. Thank you, love. And let's all give him a round of applause. What an amazing final. Moving on, who will the next contender be? Let's find out. Italy! After Pavarotti and Julius Caesar, who is Italy's next extraordinary man? Welcome, Italy. - What's your name? - Uh... Oscar, is that you? Mrs. Natalia, isn't that Backpack on channel one? What do you mean, Andrea? Turn on the TV! The TV... The extraordinary godmother of the '80s... Ladies and gentlemen... it's a miracle. Oscar just flew away! Believe me. So... extraordinary people. This is unbelievable! I hope the people at home... saw what happened. I still can't believe it. Oscar just flew away right in front of us. Hello? This is the front desk. No. I'm sorry, I don't know French. You need to speak Italian. Give me the phone. Oscar? Yes, it's me. Would you like to have breakfast with me? But I was about to leave. I've already paid your room for another night. Oscar! Good morning. It's a great honor for me! My name is David Fedeli. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So, shall we go outside? - Hey. All right. - Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. Tell me, Oscar. Nobody knew you until yesterday. Now, you're everywhere. What would you like to do in this field? What field? What field? Show business, television, Oscar! Ah. Well, TV... - uh, for example, I'd like to do a nice... - Listen, Oscar. This world is full of criminals. You need someone to take care of you. Do you hear me? Have you ever seen those documentaries in which a boat saves divers from sharks? No. That world is something like that. I'll be happy to receive ten percent of your fee, nothing more. Trust me. You're a prodigy. People would do anything to see you. You need a stage name. I don't know, something... something that'll stick. Um... The Angel! Oh, no. Not the Angel, please. Because... All right, all right. - It's an old story, you see. - It's fine. Got it! The Man Without Gravity! THE MAN WITHOUT GRAVITY Good! That's better. ♪ Truth lies within everything ♪ ♪ You can see it and you'll know ♪ ♪ Better than me ♪ ♪ Longing and longing for God When close to you, girl ♪ ♪ You said to me, Do you feel? Do you feel? ♪ ♪ It's got to be you ♪ ♪ It's got to be you ♪ ♪ Let's keep fingers crossed ♪ ♪ The sunshine is true ♪ That was fantastic, really! Did you write it? Yes, but it was a long time ago. - You are an artist. - What are you saying? Have a seat. - Here? - Yes. All right. Can I ask you something? Tell me. It's a bit silly. Don't worry. There are no secrets between us. No. Well, what I wanted to ask you... Do you think that someday... someone could write a book about me? Anything can happen, Oscar. You're the Man Without Gravity, aren't you? That would be amazing. So, all you need to do is sign here. What is it? It's a contract. To protect ourselves. A contract... But I don't... I don't know. It's all right if you don't trust me, Oscar. In any case, it was really nice to meet you... No, wait. Wait a minute. It's not that I don't trust you. It's my first time doing this. - Here. - Should I sign here? Oh, it says "Artist." Artist. Brilliant! Now, we are a team. My boy. - May I come in? - Come, come. Do you like it? Yes. It's all yours. What do you mean? It's your home now. My home? Yes. It's my present to you. You mean, I have to move here? Why, don't you like it? It's amazing! Can I bring my mom here, too? Your mom?

Ladies and gentlemen, performing live for the first time in the UK, please welcome the rising star, The Man Without Gravity! Action! Let me be free, let me fly. Stop. Let's do it again. - Hello? - Hello, Mom? Did you see the magazine? Did you get it? I'm on the whole page! I'm getting famous, Mom. Can you believe it? Yes, yes, it's beautiful. I knew it. You're too old fashioned to understand. No, it's nice. All right, okay. I'll talk to you later, Mom. Bye. Thank you for being here tonight to witness a living miracle: The Man Without Gravity! The theater was packed, Oscar! You were amazing! All I did was take off my backpack, that's it. You're very beautiful. Then what's my name? MOM Let me be free. Let me fly. Great. Very good. Fantastic! Fly now. Fly. - Great. - Very good. Open your arms. Open your arms! Very good. Very, very good. Amazing! What's up? Hey, man, how you doing? Yes, smile. - Amazing. - Wow. Look at that. Smile. You're up! Don't let me down, okay? Yes, yes. This time, I wrote a few words, if I can... just a few words, if it's possible to give a little speech... - on how I feel when I fly. - A speech. Can I do it? It's a worldwide broadcast. Who would understand you? Come on, it's time to go on-stage. Ah. Make sure you remember to do the flips, all right? Yeah, the flips. Hello? Oscar, is that you? I've called you so many times... Hello, today we are in a small town that seems frozen in time. This is the village where the extraordinary flying boy was born... The Man Without Gravity. As you can see, everything here is about him. Tourists are filling the stalls to buy souvenirs with his face on them. There's another place I want to show you. Here we are in a museum about him. Imagine, these are the rompers that he used to wear as a baby. And there, the report cards with his excellent marks. There is more... Here in this case, we have the centerpiece. This is the first, authentic backpack owned by The Man Without Gravity. This is the courtyard where he grew up. I'm sure you notice this beautiful statue, dedicated to him by the maestro Lucio Savoldelli. I'd like to ask the camera to film this plaque, because this is a very meaningful place. This is where he took his first flight. I want to show you another thing. This is the house where The Man Without Gravity was born. A child without a father... raised by a heartless and possessive mother... Look at this! You're now a star! What's wrong? Why did that woman say those things about my mom? Who? Carla Cartei, in the show about me on TV. Ah. Great! It already aired? Yes, but she shouldn't have said all of that! Those things are false. You have to call her and tell her to apologize! Calm down, Oscar! Try to be less emotional... But it's not true! You should be more detached. That's how it works in this industry. It's like an ATM. You insert your card, enter your pin, and take the money! Nobody gives a fuck about what an ATM says. I feel like an idiot. Does this guy look like an idiot? Whatever. Maybe it's also that... I'm tired of always doing the same stuff. I don't feel like doing it anymore. Let's hang in there. Let's make a ton of money. And then we tell everybody to fuck off! - Yes, but you promised me, David... - A book. Why do you think I'm here? What do you mean? Are you free tomorrow night? Oscar! I'm sorry. Let me introduce you to Lukas and Piero. Good evening. Piero. I've already ordered you the grilled octopus. I told them to put ketchup on it, just the way you like it. Thanks. Oscar, Lukas is a very distinguished publisher. I told him about your idea for a book, and he was immediately interested. Great. We would like to hit the shelves within the next three months. We think this is the right moment. How many copies did you say you wanted to print? One million. Just for the first edition. Did you hear that, Oscar? One million copies! Well, I didn't have much time, but I thought I'd start... by saying how it felt... the first time I walked. - I thought it's a good start. - Sure. My mother made me a vest with weights in the pockets... Sure, sure, very interesting. Let's see if these ideas might be useful to Piero as well. Here it is, Piero. Piero is a great writer, one of the best. He's going to write the book, but it'll be under your name, obviously. What do you mean? If I may... I've already started to write down some ideas. I will start with the day you discovered you could fly. Then we could put in how a classmate fell off a roof and you flew up to save him. Then I would take a step back. The hunger, the fact that you wouldn't eat for days... What? It's all a lie. - I didn't eat for days? - You were poor, am I right? Yes, but not... not... Narratively speaking, we feel that it's better if you were very poor. Yeah, but that's not the point. Oscar, relax, people love this stuff. Do we really want to ruin everything with the truth? Do you think Calvino really knew a viscount who was cut in half? It's not the same thing. This is my life, got it? We have prepared a draft for the cover. Look. - What's that? - Wonderful. All right. Excuse me. I'll be right back... Oscar! Oscar! You said you wanted a book, right? What will I tell them now? Tell them to write about the pink pony. I'm doing my best! I can get you money, important publishers, Time magazine. But I can't get you what they don't want. What do you mean? People don't want to read a book about what you think. You're the flying man, Oscar. And that's beautiful the way it is! That's how it works, my boy! - Hi! - I'm looking for Oscar. Is this his house? Oscar who? The Man Without Gravity. Sure, come in, come in. Mrs. Natalia! What an honor. Finally, you're here. Hello. Oscar! Oscar! Oscar! Look at this nice surprise I've organized for you. And don't say that your friend David doesn't care about you. I bet you two have a lot to talk about. Let's go, come on. I'm sorry I didn't call you, Mom. Don't worry, sweetie. David told me that you are very busy. And he also told me that you were missing me a bit. Everyone from the village says hello. Andrea is always asking me when you're going to come back to see him. Give him a call sometime, that would mean a lot to him. Why aren't you saying anything? I only see you on TV nowadays. I see you have a lot of friends now. Um... I brought you these... for the new house. I don't know if you still like them. What's this? IN 20 YEARS, YOU WILL BE MORE DISAPPOINTED BY THE THINGS YOU DIDN'T DO... WORTHY MEN ARE ALWAYS THE ONES TO HAVE SIMPLE MANNERS... You brought them all. Yes. What's wrong, sweetie? Are you sad? I still have a long-term contract... Here is our angel! Let's give him a round of applause! Louder! Louder! And now... Fly, angel! Fly! Enough, I'm not an angel! Let it go! I'm not an angel! We want to see you fly! Why are you cheering? I'm not an angel! Enough! Go fuck yourselves! Great. And now a commercial... What are we going to do? I mean, not everything's lost. David... listen. I'm done. I'm done. I can't do it anymore. I don't like anything about this life. Have you got any idea how shitty the situation you're leaving me is? We have already signed the contracts. There are penalties to pay. I'll pay them. You'll pay them... What are you going to do now? Do you think they will leave you alone? Do you think you can just walk out the door... and everything will be like it used to be? Mm. That's not how it works, Oscar. That's not how it works. Tell them I'm dead. What are you saying? The Man Without Gravity... has flown away. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Last night, Oscar Clerichetti, also known as The Man Without Gravity, passed away. The cause of death is unknown. His manager and friend, David Fedeli, announced it. For a short period of time, Clerichetti became famous as the boy who could fly. However, all experts say that he was using well-thought-out cinematic visual effects. Next, we have... Good morning, we're from Channel Four. What can you tell us about your son? Was it really all special effects? Madam! Madam! Good morning. We're making a reportage and we'd like to ask you some questions. Excuse me, madam! Just a moment, madam. Please! Hello, Desky. - Hi, Vlady. - How are you? Stop fooling everyone by going around in that wheelchair. You're fine. What about my disability allowance? Will you pay it for me? Ha. Good. I'm going to go change, so... - see you around? - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, Desky! Whoa. Lucy. Listen to me. Since you're always reading... will you check something I've written for my son? Sure! "I'll always be with you... in the journey of your life. You are my most precious jewel. - I love you. Merry Christmas, Mom." - Mom. "Journey" is spelled with "ou," right? Yes, right. So, what do you think? - It's very beautiful. - Thanks. And what do you want for Christmas? Nothing, really. It's on the house. You look like somebody who really needs it. Who does she think she is? Mimì? The new one? Mimì... I'd better go up, I got a poor devil waiting for me upstairs. Well, with all the good deeds I do for these poor guys, I think I deserve a little corner in heaven. Don't I? - Sure. - Bye. WELL-KNOWN AGENT, DAVID FEDELI, ARRESTED FOR FRAUD HIS DEBTS AMOUNT TO 3 MILLION EUROS. HE'S FACING UP TO FIVE YEARS IN JAIL. What's that? Merry Christmas, Desky! Best wishes, Desky! Are you all crazy? No! - Yes. - What are you doing? Are you crazy? I didn't buy you anything! It doesn't matter. Come on, open it! Really? Two gifts? What is this? No. Perfume? How is it? Are you trying to tell me something? Do I smell or what? Who knows? Yes, it's good. - Thank you. - Open it! And this? Ooh. So you can dress a little better, you look like you're homeless. Actually, we wanted to buy you a new backpack, because we can't stand the pink one anymore. Imagine Desky getting rid of his backpack! His mother gave it to him! Merry Christmas! - Best wishes, Desky! - Now, back to work, everyone! Come on! Let's go! Bye! Best wishes! Thank you, ladies! It's really beautiful. - Bye, Desky. - Bye. - Merry Christmas to you, too. - Merry Christmas. They have all left. Not all of them. What the fuck! Who's busting my balls? What's up? Is everything okay? Yes, don't worry. Thank you. Oh. Okay. Sorry, then. Oscar! No, no, no. - No, no, you're wrong. - Oscar. No, no, you've got me mixed up with someone else. I'm Agata. Agata? Yes, it's me, Agata. Agata... But why did the TV say you were dead? The Man Without Gravity is dead. - But I'm here. - You're right. I wanted to get in touch, but then I thought... "He's famous now, he won't even remember me." - Don't worry. Here? - Yes. - Hello, gorgeous. - Oh... When are you going to marry me? You never change, Nico. It's on the house today, gorgeous. Thanks, darling. - Is he your boyfriend? - Are you crazy? No! I was just joking. What about you? Do you have a girlfriend? No. I don't. I don't believe it. Someone famous like you doesn't have a girlfriend? But I'm not rich and famous, you know? Sure, but who knows how many girls you've had, though. No. What are you saying? And did you ever fall in love? I don't know. Maybe once. Ah. And what was she like? She was small... with big, big eyes. She wanted a pair of earrings... Let's go, come on. So this is where you live now? Yes. - Where is it? - You really aren't rich anymore. Here it is! - Listen, I really have to go now. - Hey. Wait a minute. Look. I can't believe it. It's that one! It's the one that we saw together! How did you find it? You really look like Superman! And you look like Raffa! Does it upset you to find me like this? - You really have a nice personality! - Stop it! Hi, Desky, can you give me the keys? Here. Come on, let's go. Yes? Oscar. Can you come up for a moment? Come in. May I? - Come in and close the door. - Yes. Hi... Look at the state of me. I never wear this sweater. You look great. Where do I go? There. Go there. Go! Go! Good morning. - I would like to make a bank transfer. - Yes. - Do you have the name of the recipient? - Yes, sure. And the IBAN, please. - Yes. It's all written there. - Thank you. What should I put as the reason for payment? Write this... "Have you ever seen those documentaries in which a boat saves divers from sharks?" Something like that. You need a grown-up backpack now. That pink one is definitely too old and ugly. Use this one instead. For me? Thank you! It's my duty, sir! I've got something for you, too. Here. - What is it? - Open it. It's an agate. Beautiful and colorful. Do you remember? Hold me tight. Hi, Agata! For you. The key. Poor guy! Is he in love with you or something? What's the matter? Did I offend you? Can you please leave? What? I told you to get out. Are you crazy? Get out! Get the fuck out! Out! Whore! What the fuck are you thinking, huh? What kind of life can we have together, Oscar? I won't be dirt poor ever again, do you understand? Huh? And anyway, look at us... Do you want to end up on TV again? The whore and the disabled? I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Forgive me, please! - Oscar! - No, no. You're right, Mimì. Oscar! Sweetie. Come on, sweetie. Let's try this on. Come. Sweetie! - You look very handsome. - "And then God said to Noah..." Go on, you read it. Great idea. So he can grow up as ignorant as we are... - Oscar. Oscar! - Where have you been? What if you'd flown away? You're staying inside with your mom and your grandma... He's just a kid, he gets bored. This child... will never be safe outside, don't you understand? ...violence. Is filled with violence because of them. You mustn't talk to anyone, is that clear? Batman never tells anybody that he's a superhero. Batman never reveals his secret. What do you want? It doesn't have Batman on it, but it's nice anyway. Wait! What? - Your gloves. - Right. - Goodbye, love. - Have a good day at work, love. Look! That's amazing! It's like being in an American movie! Batman! Batman! Batman! I'm here! Here! Take me away from this shitty place!
