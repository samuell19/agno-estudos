Carmen, you've never told me why you hate him. Why are you unfaithful? Darling, what else can I do but hate him, he's an imbecile! Did you know the poor man's terrified of me? - Really? - Absolutely terrified, yes. Why? Because he knows I've found out his trick. He has no personality, as a man or as an architect. I see. He copies everything from foreign magazines. - Really? - Of course. - So you despise him? - He disgusts me. Why don't you leave him? Because of you. - You're so intelligent. - Me? You don't want the burden of a pregnant woman like me. But if you want me to, I'll leave him in a flash. But... no, he'd keep the kids, he loves them. What's the matter? Do you feel ill? If you could see him, every time I give birth... I'm suffering, suffering like a beast. And while I'm in pain, he only cares about the child bothering the doctor, is it a boy or a girl? He feels unwell when you're in labour, thinking he has to do something. I'll stay by your side. Lie down here. I'm here, I'll look after you. You're the only thing on my mind. I only care about you. Calm down... Ernesto! You're at your threshold of pain, it will soon be over. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. There, there, easy. Calm down. Good girl. Deep breathing! Breathe! That's it, like that. Don't lose the rhythm, don't lose it. It'll soon be over. Very good, that's it. Breathe! Breathe! I'm calling the doctor! - No don't go! Don't leave! - I'm not leaving! I'll stay with you. I love you Teresa! Please, calm down... I'm not going anywhere. - It's coming! - It's coming? It's come out! You're amazing! Take it, it's your daughter. Thank you! Thank you! My daughter... our daughter... She's so beautiful! She's started crying. I'm so happy! She looks like me. She has my eyes, my nose, my ears, my mouth. She's exactly like me. How much do you think she weighs? 5 kilos? - Maybe more? - Maybe more. What shall we call her? I don't know, Cristina after my mother, or Cristino after my father... Yes, it's a good name! If only mum could see her! What a pair of fools! What a sight! Come and help me. Or have you changed your mind? No, not at all. Let's find a place for all the antiques. It's decided. Don't you want to see this? Let's see. What do you think? Horrible! She's wonderful... and very sexy. You don't like it? - Right, let's work. - Ok. Did you say something? Have you ever been mad at me? What a question. Maybe a bit short... You didn't answer. I've told you before. That time in Germany. That wasn't anger, it was stupidity. I mean something serious. No. And you know it, you're just asking for the fun of it. Fine. But Pedro, tell me the truth: have you ever thought about having an affair? No. But if you did, what kind of woman would you choose? Stop saying these stupid things, Teresa. None. You're my wife and I don't need any other women. Yeah. You love me like a husband. And according to Juan, I'm not good enough for that. Don't believe anything that clown says. He's an idiot. All men, when it comes to an 'adventure'... look for a very different type of woman to their partner. I want to know what your type is. You're such a pain. For a lover, and for a wife, I'd always choose you. Fine, if you won't tell me. If you... Don't get mad about this. Do you remember that outfit I bought you but you never wore? What outfit? The black one with the pantyhose, gloves, underwear, shoes... Shortly after we got married. Yes, I remember, why? No, nothing. Do you want me to put it on? I wanted you to. - I still have it. - No, it's okay. Doesn't matter. Stop. Turn around. Come. You're beautiful. What else does she have to do? There's a message for you in the living room. I need to talk to you. Come downstairs now. Come closer. Thank you for coming, Teresa. We need to clear up a few things after everything that happened between us. Because between us, no harm was ever intended, and I don't see why there should be any now. I know men are sometimes hard to understand, and seem strange. Especially through a woman's eyes... and even more so a woman... who's almost a little girl. Because you're still a little girl. Have a seat. No, I want you to sit in that chair. Something wrong? My husband's angry with me. He has been ever since we got married. Your husband loves you. He has his flaws, everyone does, but do you think I didn't cause your poor mother the same heartache?. Mama suffered a lot because of you. Maybe we should forget about that. Pedro never looked at me like he did at her. Never. Her! You forced him to behave that way. In the end, he was so weak that he got drawn into that childish game. That innocent fantasy of the absurd, including everything you ever wanted, but always centred upon you. Only you. There's no other, Teresa. Believe me. Come. Deep down, your husband was trying to inject some life into your marriage. Are you going to hold a grudge against him for that? If you tell me to. Ah, there's a good girl. Now let's go and look for your husband. Daddy? Yes? Tell me, my child. My grades. Your grades? From school. Oh yes. Let's have a look... how are your grades doing? Grammar, 3. Arithmetic, 2. History, 1. Geography, 1. Teresa, you can't continue like this. You've no right to be wasting your time this way. Yes, daddy. Don't you realise that when you're older you'll regret this lack of application? What happens is you get distracted too much. You don't concentrate. Come here. Listen. If I said you're slow, I'd take it back. But you're an intelligent girl. You understand that to correct your ways, I have to punish you? Yes, daddy. It hurts me more than you, but I have no other choice. Come on. Daddy, stop, I'll be good! I promise, I'll study more! I'll get 10s in all my subjects, like in religion. In religion? Why did you get a 10 in religion? Do you like that subject more than the others? Well, no... Then what? In religion we have fun, we play, we sing... Sing? What songs do you sing? Lots. - Do you know Saint Catherine's song? - No. Shall I teach you? Ok, yes. Saint Catherine was a very good girl. She loved God, and was always praying. But her father was evil. He worshipped Buddha. - Now you be the father. - Me? Yes. You'll need a sabre. This will do. Ok. I'll sing it in French, because in school we always sang in French. You listen to the song and do what the words say. Shall we start? There's just one thing. In school, we all sang together. But now there's only me. I don't think it matters much. - Ok. Ready? - Ready when you are. St Catherine St Catherine was the king's daughter The king's daughter, do re mi fa sol la One day at prayer One day at prayer her father found her Her father found her, do re mi fa sol la What are you doing, my child? What are you doing, worshipping Buddha? Worshipping Buddha, do re mi fa sol la Father, I love God Father, I love God, but you don't But you don't, do re mi fa sol la Bring me my sabre! Bring me my sabre and my cutlass! And my cutlass, do re mi fa sol la With the second sabre blow With the second sabre blow her father wounded her Her father wounded her, do re mi fa sol la With the third sabre blow With the third sabre blow her father killed her Her father killed her, do re mi fa sol la St Catherine is dead, her soul has gone to heaven. Now it starts to snow, the snow covers her body. It's snowing, it's snowing. We need more snow! More, more! It covers her dead body! More and more snow! It's an enormous snowstorm! But little St Catherine... She's a martyr, and is about to perform her first miracle. Her father will regret his mistakes! Help! White, purifying snow falls from the skies! - St Catherine, what's the matter? - I'm cold! I'm freezing! I'm going to freeze! St Catherine, I'll save you! Help, I'm dying! A big St Bernard is coming to save you, guided by his sense of smell. I've lost the trail! Mission accomplished! Here I am, St Catherine. A St Bernard dog has come to save me. My darling doggy! Drink this! Climb on my back. Take me to safety! To safety! The steps! One, two... Lie down, lie down. Good doggy! You saved my life, and I need to reward you. Hey, don't lick me! You saved my life, and I'll give you a good prize. Lie down. Lie down! Stay there. Look what I have for doggy! No! Give me your paw. Very good. You like that? Not on the floor, on the plate! Put it on the plate, do you hear, damned dog! Where are you going? Come here! Come here right now! You disgusting dog! You stupid animal... I'm going to- Come out from there! Come out right now! Damned animal! Come out! Out! Now you'll see! I'll get you out! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Enough! - Pedro, I'm sorry. - Get off. - I'm sorry Pedro. Did I hurt you? - Leave me alone. I said I'm sorry! I said I was sorry. - Pedro I'm sorry. - I heard you. Can you imagine the servants? If they could see us they'd say... of course... playing at dogs. They've nothing else to do. Especially him. Giving orders all day. If I had to work as one... Work, her? She works hard enough looking in that mirror... she's so vain. You've a weak imagination. I'm sure they say much worse things. - About me. - About both of us. I know what they say about me. That all I care about is earning money. That I don't give a damn about the rest. The man comes home, says he's tired, eats, and goes to bed. I bet the woman regrets living with him 1000 times a day. Ana, can't you see what's going on? When he's around she plays the victim, the martyr. But when he's gone, doesn't she have fun. Haven't you heard her on the phone with her 'friends'? Yes, I've heard. If her husband had a little courage he'd leave her. But he's a coward. Imagine what his bosses and workmates would say if he left her. They'd make an example of him. And why don't you think she'd be the one to leave him? Easy. She's never turned in her life. Not for anything or anyone. Besides, where would she find another idiot like that? You've got that right. I think the best for him would be if she died. Then he'd be alone, and in peace. Don't think he hasn't thought about it. Sometimes, he's a miserable git, capable of anything. Get dressed. We're having dinner. What do you want us to play now? Ourselves. Our song. You still remember. It's been a few years since then. Too many... - 5 years. - Yes, 5 years. Do you remember? You told me to sit on the sofa. The first time you came to my house. You had something for me, I remember it well. You bought it that afternoon. Here. It's for you. Teresa, I love you. Pedro. Let me put it on for you. Will you marry me? Yes, Pedro. As soon as possible? I love you. You look beautiful. Sit down. Are you happy? I'm the happiest man in the world. You were, back then. That was a long time ago. Too long. This game doesn't work, Teresa. The past is the past. We can play something else. Whatever you want. No, enough Teresa. We've already gone too far. Yes. We can play at splitting up. Good idea, don't you think? We'd both have a great time, I'm sure. A lot of fun. It's an easy game Pedro. One of us decides to leave. You, for example. As we're both educated people, there won't be any drama. - I'll help you pack your suitcase. - No, Teresa, that's enough. Come into the bedroom. You'll see. Tell me what you want to take with you. - That's enough. - Pedro, it's a game. You tell me what you want to take, and I'll pack it. If you insist, I'll go to a hotel. I'll need underwear, shirts, pyjamas, a suit - that's all. - Fine. A small suitcase, then. - Yes. Later, when you're settled, you can fetch the rest of your stuff. I'll find the suitcase. I'll need to speak with our lawyer. Or do you want to use him? I can find another. Whatever you want. Sorry Pedro, I'm very selfish. After all it's you who's leaving. - Wouldn't you prefer to stay here? - No no, the house is yours. Plus, you have it all decorated the way you like it, so... - Thank you Pedro. - You're welcome. It's a shame to end it this way. You're right, it's a shame. But we can't stay together. Splitting up is the best option. Don't you think? Yes, I agree. We were wrong. I should leave you some money, but I don't have any here. Is a cheque ok? I don't mind, in any case I don't need it now. Do you know how much you'll need per month? Me? I think we should leave that to the lawyers... Ok, fine with me. Oh yes, my shaving stuff. I don't understand why people make a big deal about separating. Pedro, we should agree on what we're going to tell our friends. They're going to drive us crazy with their questions. Separating like this... it's so... unexpected. I think the best thing is to tell them the truth. That we can't be together. - The truth? - Yes. We can't stand each other any more, we hate each other. The truth. Yes, you're right. Why lie about it? Shirts, handkerchiefs, socks... - I forgot my suit. - Oh! Your suit! Here it is. I think that's everything. Right. The moment has arrived. Yes. I want to... say the right words... say that in these 5 years, there's been so much- Pedro... don't. I'd like to avoid saying goodbye. Let's do one thing. Please don't leave the house until I tell you. Ok, as you wish. Thanks. What a shame I didn't really die! That would have been perfect! You'd be free, no complications! - Don't think you're that lucky! - The games are over, Teresa. I'm leaving, do you hear me? Go! Go, and don't come back! Pedro, don't go. Please, forgive me.
