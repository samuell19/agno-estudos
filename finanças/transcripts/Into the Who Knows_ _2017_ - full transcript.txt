Guess what? Our space flight was successful. We made it! The Vieutian beasts appear to have a rudimentary city. We must be careful. Right Felix? Do you copy sidekick? What are you doing? - I'm exploring Venus, remember? - You need good air. - Maybe I adapted to Venus air. - See, that's great now. - Thomas. - I'm supposed to be alone mom. Being this is an uninhabited planet. - Actually, you're supposed to be getting ready to leave. I told Mrs. Paul we'd be there 10 minutes ago. - Who's Mrs. Paul? - Chester's mom. - Why am I going to see Chester's mom? - You're going to see Chester. - Who? - He'll be in your class in the fall. - Not another one. - And Felix stays here. You're going to Chester's to actually play with Chester. - I just don't want a repeat of last fall to Rock Island. - Me either, that's why I set this appointment up. Ready? - Nope. - You look like you got some provisions here. Legos, okay. What's with all these clothes? - Be prepared. You know? - Okay. - Let's get this over with. - It's gonna be fun. - There's no Felix? - It's a human only trip. - Yup. Just us people. The trick is to outrun them. You don't want to get caught. Yes! Like that! Did you see that Thomas? You want next? - Thanks. - How goes it? - As smooth as Pop Rocks. - You should get ready to play. I don't think Chester's very good at this. - I've gotta get in all my screen time today, 'cause there won't be any at camp. Are you going to camp? Did they have camp in Illinois? Around here everyone goes. Oh no! Okay, you could have next next turn. Camp is toad's awesome. Aside from the no screen thing, that sucks. Mom! You're a nut job! - Can you pass the peas please? Thank you. - You're welcome. Shut up. - Excuse me? - I was talking to Felix. - See. - I know. I know. - What? - Hey! - Your dad and I think you're spending too much time with Felix, and not enough time with kids your own age. - That's silly. I just saw Chester. - Yeah, and his mother banned you from her house forever. - Felix will think this is hilarious. - Listen, we just want you to make friends before the school year. - I have a friend. A good friend. - If you spend as much time making friends as you do making things up-- - Thomas, since we are the parents, we've talked about it and-- - And we are sending you to summer camp. You're going to Slumber Falls. - It's gonna be great. I went to camp when I was a kid. I had a fantastic time. - Felix doesn't like swimming. Or water even. - Tom. We don't think you should take Felix. - It's just, none of the other kids are gonna have a teddy bear. - He's a fox. - Well, they're not really gonna have a fox either. Come on, it'll be great for you. You get to meet the other kids and-- - How can I make friends with other kids? You guys keep moving me around. I've been friends with Felix forever. - I am sure you and the other kids are gonna have a great time. - I know. - Thomas? It's time to say goodnight.

If you're a good swimmer you get a blue bead. If you do okay you get a yellow. And then a red. - And red for? - A non-swimmer. - No thanks, I'm a conscientious objector. I didn't even bring my towel. - Hey fill it. Stay hydrated. - I'm already like 75% water. Sorry. - Hi Thomas. - Hi clones. - You have to change for dinner. - Everyone has to go to every meal, even, red beads. - I'm not a red bead, I'm a no bead. I wear this bead in protest. - You have to wear it. So we know you'll drown. - I don't need your dumb blue beads. I've been to places you can't even think of. The lake, ha! Kids stuff. I'll show you guys a real adventure. - Look, he's been playing with his stuffed animal. Like a baby! - Trying new things is hard. - Don't say I didn't try. - Hey, that's for emergencies. - This is an emergency. - Thomas, how's camp? You making friends? - Dad, you need to come and get me out of here. - Look, just hang in there. It'll make your mom so happy. - Does he sound okay? - He sounds fine, hold on a second. - They laughed at me. - What about Chester? - You're taking their side now. No one's on my side but me and Felix. - We're giving you a chance to get away from your stuffed animal and try to make some real friends. - Wait, what is he saying? - On our own Felix. - Dinner squirt. Hurry it up. The monster's in the mess hall tonight. - Good evening campers! - Good evening Counselor Mike! - I'd like to welcome you old hats back to Slumber Falls. And I'd like to welcome some of our new campers as well. Now we here at Slumber Falls, we have a little tradition. Just because it's summer, that doesn't mean that learning's done. Mm mm. You all know what I'm talking about. - Useless information of the day! - That's right. It's time for useless information of the day. What day? - Day one! - And to help me out, I'm gonna need to bring up our monsters.

You've wandered off one too many times. - You know, hold on Ian. This young man just volunteered for KP duty. - KP? - Get your back into it. Really get into those beans. So, where were you heading? - Nowhere, just out. - Out's good. I had some things out there. Most I like especially. - Things like what? - Who knows. - Well it's gotta be better than here. They threw me in the water this morning. - Can't swim? - I can swim awesome. That was a protest. - Oh sure. Like running out of dinner was a protest? Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do. Go find adventures where you like. - See, you understand me. I wanna go find adventures where I like. - Like say, run off into them woods? - I can manage. - Yeah, there's no one there to tell you to swim. Say go to bed and live off the wilderness. You can live in your own world out there. I hear they have a nice campfire opening night. That sound like an adventure? I'll take care of the rest. Maybe put up these tubs of dirty dishes off across the lake. Off to that land of Who Knows. - Thanks. - Oh boy. - I open this first campfire of the summer in the name of the Order of the Owl. We, like the owl, are wise. We respect the woods and the great totem. We stay on the path clearly marked. - Shh, I don't know what's with the white rocks. - They just mark a safe path around here. - I heard they control the totem. - Oh great totem, help me to call down favors to help these young campers on their summer journeys. Behold and be not afraid. The great forest totem is among us. - That's just Ian. - It's a sacred ceremony. Why can't you just get into it? Pretend along with the rest of the kids. Just go to your cabin. Just stay there all day for all I care. - We don't need these people telling us when to eat, how to swim, and how much to drink. - Or how many monkeys know sign language. - Yeah. - Your bead! - That's a sign of my oppression. Here we can make a new necklace. We're master swimmers. Shell level swimmers. - Man, we're gonna look good. - Now what shall we do with our world? Whoa, look at this. An ancient trail. - Maybe it's a sign of the totem. - Yeah right. I thought exploring took longer. - There is no set time. - This is definitely home base. Fortress in the Who Knows. - This is just like being back at camp though. Foxes don't hang around home base. They roam. - There's no one to tell us what to do or where to go. We can do anything we like. - We can roam? - Yeah. But we have a base now. Search party! - What? Should we say hi? - You don't understand running away do you? Do you think they'll give up? - I don't think they can. Not until they find you. Or your body. - My body? - They've gotta know. You're either there or you know, in the Who Knows. - Weird. - Maybe we should go back. - No. So, we catch the fish and then we just eat the fish? - If it's cold, that's sushi. - Should we cook it? - It doesn't seem right to cook anybody in the Who Knows. A man's gotta eat though. Got anything? - Nope. Are you sure fish like peanut butter? That kid Randy was allergic to nuts. Maybe fish are allergic to peanut butter. - Yeah. ♪ Useless information of the day ♪ - Stop it. Hey, Felix. It gets dark pretty quickly out here in the Who Knows. - We got a whole sky to sleep under. - But we got a base. - What if there's a totem out here? - Exactly. We got a base with lanterns. Oh! - What's with the rocks? - Just, you know, in case I need to use them. Way better than a dumb campfire right? - It's something. Search party probably won't see. - We'll leave it on while we sleep. Just in case. - In case of what? - It'll be on all night. If anything comes, it'll be on tape. - You mean film? - I mean digital. It's kind of like a security camera. Get up. - Foxes are nocturnal. - What do you think it saw? - Lots of snoring. - It'll be on all night. If anything comes, it'll be on tape. - You mean film? - I mean digital. It's kind of like a security. This is awesome. Wait. It stopped. - I know, keep going. - No, I mean, that's all. - What was that? - A bird, a mega bird. Maybe an elk. - What's that totem supposed to look like? - That's hokey camp stuff. - Right. - Okay, so I don't know what it is now, but I will, and I'm gonna capture it. And we're using the marshmallows as bait of course. - But all we have left to eat is marshmallows. - We can eat herbs and spices from the woods. - Or we could go back. Safety in numbers, you know? I'll even sleep in the thermos. - And miss the discovery of a lifetime? How big do you figure this thing is? - Probably average. - Average to what? - Spirit type things. - I plan to make it as big as a deer. Small deer. - It had the phone way up by the roof. - You're right, better add some pokey sticks. - You know, the Native Americans honored their spirits and deities. They respected them. - You have to be pretty crazy to believe in that kind of stuff. Come on, help me with the marshmallows. If the Native Americans had all those spirits and stuff, where did they go? - Maybe they knew you were coming and took an early retirement. - Why can't the scientists find them? - I don't think scientists know about the marshmallows. What's this tied here for? - It'll sound and set off an alarm and seal its fate. Well? - I foresee no problems. Maybe it can't smell the bait. - Maybe it smells us. - And I'm hungry. I don't know if fish like marshmallows. - We should start hunting. I have a knack with traps. - Clearly. - Do you really believe something's out there? - What? In the forest? - The universe. What could be out there in a big empty space? - I'm not sure it's that far away. - I mean, how ridiculous to think that some invisible good could be floating around and patrolling things. It certainly doesn't help me out much. - I guess it depends on how you see things. You hear that? - Yeah, it's bugs and stuff. Come on. - No, it's something else. It's the defacer! You've been defaced! - Give it back! - No! - Do you think they know I'm gone? - They're probably worried. - Those kids didn't sound worried. - Your parents might send a search party. - I'll keep moving. - How far are you going to go?

For our plan. - What plan? - I'm working on it. - Okay. I'll go draw it out. Come out. I meant that in a, come out and let's have a nice chat sort of way. Not as a come out and eat me sort of way.

It looked wonderful. - Let's regroup. Okay, first of all, those bugs. - Sprites. - Okay, how do we know they're okay? They're friends with that monster. - It doesn't seem that monstrous to me. - It didn't mess up my pokey stick. - Have you considered inviting it? - Oh right. I'll just ask it to tea. - We tried it your way, how about trying it another way? - Not a trap. Maybe some place it likes. - Some place special. - I never quite got the white rocks thing. - More inviting. - Well, to have a friend, you have to be a friend. Mom said that. I don't know whether to be excited or terrified. - Maybe both are okay. - Do you think I scared it away? - I don't know. You did try to trap it. - Yeah. - You know, the Who Knows is an unusual place. A little magical, a little dangerous. Most people don't even look for it but you're still here. - What do you think would happen if I brought somebody else out here? - To the Who Knows? - Like dad. Or mom. Or even Chester. - Maybe nothing.

I just got a great idea. - You're gonna call them? - No, we can do this flying thing to keep exploring. - The forest? - And beyond. We can just keep floating and floating. - But we have to bring it back. It's the totem's. - We don't need the totem. - The totem's our friend now. - You're my friend. - It can't be just you and me forever. You know that. - Why not? I want things to go back to the way they were. - Don't you think you're missing something? - You sound just like 'em now. There's no one on my side except me. Just me. I'm all alone. Felix! Felix!

You should've seen me running all over the place. You got me really worried. I was actually really scared. For real. Hey, at least I found you. Just me, my friend Felix, having adventures in the woods. I know you didn't think I'd find you, but I did. It was a really big tree, but I wasn't afraid. Did you get sick out there? We'll find all kinds of trouble to get into tomorrow. Depends on what you're up for. What's that? Oh. I thought you said something. Come on, we might actually catch something this time. Come on. He's not right. Please help me. Please! Hey, no! I'm sorry I always mess things up. Just bring back my friend, okay? I'll do anything you want. Please help me. It's you! - Mostly. You're squishing my guts. - What's with them? - Oh. They're my friends. - I don't know if we're gonna have enough marshmallows for everyone. - They don't really eat marshmallows. - You can eat them. I'll find herbs and berries from the woods. - Thomas-- - And we can go back to the camp if you want. It'll be just like before. Okay, we could do anything you like. We can stay here. - I don't think this is the sort of place you can stay in forever. - What is this place really? - You can't really understand the Who Knows. 'Cause then it's just The Knows. - Not even a hint? - You'll know some day. You're already halfway there. - I don't know what I'm gonna do without you. - You might feel lonely sometimes, but, you're never really alone. - I'm glad you get to stay with the totem Felix. - You'll have even bigger adventures than these ones Thomas. - Felix. You're my best friend. Don't burn your cabin down. Mom! I'm over here! I'm here! I'm alive! I'm alone! - Tom? - Mom? Hey! I'm here! Mama! - Thomas! - Hey! - Are you okay! Are you okay? - Yes! - Stay there, stay! - Babe you good? Yeah? - You okay? You okay? You're not hurt? - 7285, code six. - Did you make that fire? - You cannot run away like that. - I know. - You could have starved bud. - I had all those marshmallows. - You see what happens when you go outside the white rocks? You get lost. That's why we have protocol. - And did you get lost or did you just go out there to wander? - I wandered around til I got lost enough to come back. - Lost is just lost. - Yeah, sounds like you ain't never been lost in your whole life. - We thought you'd drowned or something. - I was on the other side, in the Who Knows. - What's that? - It's a secret sort of thing. - What does that even mean? - Don't say it. If you say it, it won't be a secret anymore. Awesome. - Oh my god! He's back. And they were looking everywhere.
