[gunshots] [tires squealing] [woman on radio] 6-0, 7-0-7, 6-0 77, at your location... [doorbell ringing] [man] I'm sorry to tell you, Mrs. LaRosa, Jack's in the hospital in Los Angeles. [Jeannie] He's been in an accident, right? A hijacking or something. Oh, oh... Call Wally, quick, tell him to get here quick. What happened? [phone ringing] Hello? What? Okay, I'll be right there. Jeannie. Down the hatch, come on. Come on. Attagirl. Oh, Wally, I can't. May I hear the rest of this? We received a telephone call this evening informing us that Jack LaRosa suffered gunshot wounds. It was in, apparently, an aborted attempt to hijack his truck. He is in stable condition. Is that all you got? They were apparently hijacking him until the truck was empty. Empty? What are they doing, hijacking empty trucks in California now? What the hell, are they practicing or something? What happened to his truck? Jack's truck's all right, it's in custody of the sheriff's department. Truck is in custody, but the crooks got away, huh? That's California for ya, huh? [aircraft engine] [Jeannie] Will he be in a wheelchair or stretcher, Wally? [Wally] I don't know. I'm really scared. I know you are, honey, I know you are, but the doctors say he's gonna be all right. It's just gonna take a little time. [Jeannie] Jack? Oh, Jack! [Jack] They're not gonna keep me laid up for six months. I'll be back on the road in a month, maybe less. [Jeannie] Jack LaRosa, you're gonna follow the doctor's orders. I can't afford to lay around here for six days, along six months. Imagine what this hospital is costing? This is no time to worry about money, Jack. Well, we gotta find someone to pick up the truck and drive it back down. The storage charges are gonna eat us alive. I'm sorry, honey, it's just that we staked our whole future on that truck. If I'm laid up for even three months, the whole thing goes right down the drain.

You're Mrs. Jack H. LaRosa? Yes, hello! Howdy, I'm C.W. Douglas, Vehicle Retrievals Incorporated. Oh, hi, how are you? Howdy. I have here a contract duly signed and executed in my favor from The Acme National Loan company. To find and take possession of one 1978 sturdy-built Superliner, serial number 241JK790A, currently registered in the name of Jack. H. and Jeannie S. LaRosa of this address. What does that mean? What does it mean? It means, missy, that as of the 15th of this month you were four months behind on your loan payments, which comes to a grand total of $6,233. Now, unless you can hand me a check for that amount right now, missy, then you'd better tell me where the truck is or you're gonna find yourself in a sea of trouble. You have the check? No. It's fine, then tell me where the truck is. I don't see it. We're talking $80,000 worth of rolling stock here, missy. Now I aim to take possession of and return that investment to its legal owner. Now you can make it hard for yourself or you can make it easy, but one way or another, C.W. Douglas is going to have that truck. [suspense music] [man] Damn, we get the stuff from Mexico and the cops end up babysitting it. [man] Do you think they found it? Not a chance. [engine revving] [tires squealing] Wally, Wally, Wally? Listen, there's this man. There's this man and his name is C.W., C.W. something, I can't remember his name, and he scares me half to death, I don't know who he is. That's old C.W. Douglas. C.W. Douglas. He's liable to be giving us all nightmares before he's through. He's dedicated man. Dedicated to what exactly? Repossessing trucks. Repossessing trucks. That's his mission in life, repossessing trucks, coast to coast. He, he, he'd follow a man to the ends of The Earth and jump up after 'em if he had to, and he's been repossessing trucks for 20 years, maybe more. That's right, ma'am. Are you serious, Wally? I figure we got about the worst kind of trouble a trucker can have. Well, if Jack loses that truck, you know, Wally, that'll kill him, you know that. Jeannie, if you could get that truck on the road, pick up loads and stay a step ahead of C.W. Douglas, you could make enough money to get back on solid ground while Jack's in the hospital. What do you mean, me? There's all kinds of lady truckers on the roads these days. Oh, Wally, that's really, wow, that's crazy. Come here, come here, let me show you something. I don't even know how to drive a truck. That's Flatbed Annie. She's a feisty little thing, but she can handle just about any rig there is on the road. When she's sober. If anybody can give old C.W. Douglas a run for his money, Flatbed Annie can. And I think I might be able to talk her into showing you the ropes, Jeannie. [woman singing] ♪ Why can't you be like rodeo girls ♪ ♪ Why can't you be like rodeo girls ♪♪ Oh, Wally, you're really out of your cotton picking mind. [everyone stamping] [typing] [stamping] Georgina? They made a mistake, they made a mistake on my check. That is a mistake, $17.34. [woman on intercom] Jeannie LaRosa, please come to Mr. Murray's office. [phone ringing] He's paging me. What does he want with you? I'll see you. [typing] [knocking on door] Come in. Have a seat, Mrs. LaRosa. I assume you know Mr. Douglas. Mr. Douglas has attached your wages in the name of The National Loan Company. Needless to say, this is a grave embarrassment to the department. Now as I understand it, Mr. Douglas is willing to sit down in private with you and attempt to work out an arrangement which will eliminate the attachment process, is that correct, Mr. Douglas? That's correct, Mr. Murray. Good, good, I'll leave you two alone to work this matter out. Please bear in mind that financial irresponsibility on the part of county employees casts a pall over all county government, Mrs.. LaRosa. If you're going to continue your career in this department, it's imperative you work this out with Mr. Douglas. [door closing] Now you wouldn't want that old truck to ruin a person's career, would you, missy? Career? [laughing] I'm a clerk typist, I make $137.50 a week. That's my point, honey, you can't afford the truck. Plus I've been doing a little checking around, I guess you know that, and it seems like you're behind on your payments on your house and your furniture and your car and the truck. And you know how nervous these credit people get, I mean, if they find out I'm attaching your wages, they're gonna be all over you like a cheap suit. Well this can't be legal, I mean, what are we supposed to live on? Again, that's my point, Mrs. LaRosa. I'm just trying to help you, missy, now if you'll just tell me where the truck is, and all your problems will be over. No, no, no, no.It's that simple,yes. No, no, you can, uh, you can just forget that. You're making a mistake, missy. I'll never tell you where that truck is. You know, you can-- You can have our house and our furniture and our car. And my stupid job... But you'll never, you'll never ever lay your hands on that truck. [door closing] That's pathetic. [crying] Nobody's gonna take anything that's mine... [slamming drawers] Away from me! [slamming drawer] Ever! [slamming drawers] [slamming drawers] [sign buzzing] [machine buzzing] [Jeannie] Somebody told me that I could find Flatbed Annie here.

Well, that depends. Pardon? Maybe I am, maybe I ain't. Depends on what shout it is. So what is your shout, Sweetiepie? Uh, well, my name is Jeannie LaRosa and I think that Wally spoke to you about-- Oh, yeah, yeah, right, forget it. Well, um, you quite haven't heard what I was gonna say. Look, I got more important things to do with my time than try and teach some prissy ding-a-ling how to drive a big rig, so why don't you take a hike, honey? [machine clinking] Listen, you foul-mouthed little delinquent, you are gonna listen to what I have to say whether you like it or not. Crackers! Don't blow a gasket, honey. Come on, let's you and me have a drink. Let me get this straight, this is the shout: what you're offering me is full partnership, right? Absolutely. I teach you to drive. Right. Hmm. Do you always wear your hair like that? Yeah. Somehow you just don't seem like primo material to me, Sweetiepie. Well, I'm a very quick learner, you'll see that. Well, you know, a person just don't step off the curb and up into the driver's seat in an old 18-wheeler, you understand what I mean? I mean, now look, you probably wouldn't be ever no outstanding driver, you know what I mean? That is something you're born with, instinct, you know? A feel for it. We can forget outstanding, I can live with good. Good, we can handle, and C.W. we can handle. Uh, C.W. I think is going to be a very big problem, I don't think that you can underestimate him. Oh, shoot, he don't show me nothin'. C.W. played hard trying to catch Flatbed Annie in The Superliner. That is what it is now, ain't it? A Superliner? Oh, yes. Take more than that old coot to stop us. Take two Sherman tanks and a 20-foot snow bank to even slow us down once we get that Superliner on the blacktop. Well, then we got a deal, huh? Yeah, you got it, Sweetiepie. Superliner, huh? Yeah. Is that the way you always wear your hair?
