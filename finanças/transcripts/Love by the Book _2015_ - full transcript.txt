Real life is one thing. Fiction is another. My sister Jane and I were raised on a steady diet of fish sticks and fairy tales. Mom, wanting us to believe in love and chivalry, read us every happily-ever-after story she could get her hands on. I bought right into it... A romantic to the core. We lived in the pages of books, staging epic battles, going on magical adventures. Well, I was always the perfect princess, of course. And then you slay the dragon, charm the prince, and then you rescue me. And made Jane play the handsome prince more times than she cares to remember. How come you always get to be the princess? Because I'm the older sister. I'll be waiting in my castle. Maybe that's why she became more pragmatic. But what if the prince doesn't show up, Emma? Oh, he'lshow up. He always does. She may have had a point, but I remained optimistic. I've always believed that that storybook ending is possible, that there really is someone out there who's all the things I've been dreaming about since playing princess. I guess I've been waiting for my Prince Charming to show up and make our happily ever after come true. Thank you. - Hey, em. - Hey. Thanks for meeting me. If we never met up after your night shifts, I'd go days without getting any sister time. [Both chuckle] Breakfast with the Graham girls. Ooh. But Jane didn't believe in waiting for anything. Greg, I didn't know you'd be joining us for breakfast. Well, I invited him, because we have news. - We're engaged. - What? Jane, let me see the ring. Oh, we didn't bother with anything fancy. Now we get to plan your wedding. Well, there's not much time for that. What? Why? Okay, so we decided to have the wedding in one month. Greg's entire family will be in town for their reunion. We can save a lot of money, which we need to do, and then keep things simple, easy. Throw it together? It's a wedding, not a salad. Well, you'll help me, right? As my maid of honor? Jane, of course I will. [Both giggle] Good. Isn't it funny how sometimes the romantic one is the one with no romance in her life? But the one place I could always find a good love story was my bookstore... A world of my own creation where I could share the wonderful stories I loved as a child with everyone who I came in. Phil, you forgot to change the sign again. Did you forget to do that again? Someone forgot to remind me to do that again. Oh, of course. It's my fault entirely. How is Jane? Well, she and Greg are engaged. Wonderful. Oh. It is wonderful, right? Yeah, of course it is. Here you go, Emma, a latte for you and an herbal tea for Frank. Marilyn, you are amazing. You remember everything. Don't worry, Emma. You'll meet your Prince Charming one day. - [Gasps] - Ooh. I am so sorry. Eric, you beat me here. Emma, this is your surprise. You brought me a guy? No, no. This is my son, Eric. - Eric, this is Emma Graham. - Nice to meet you, Emma. Nice to meet you. Emma, I have to tell you, of all my investments, this is by far the most enchanting one I have. Of course, the rest of them are really boring things like hardware stores, laundromats, stuff like that. Oh, Frank, Marilyn made you a tea. Oh. Thank you, Marilyn. Would you like something to drink, Eric? Anything you like, on the house. No, thanks. Emma, can the three of us talk in your office, just for a minute, please? Yeah. So, Frank, I still don't understand what this is about. Well, Emma, it's simple. I brought Eric by here today because I would like him to shadow you in your business. Shadow me? He's learning about my investments, all right? And I'd like him to get a hands-on feel for your business, that's all. Two, three weeks, tops. We... you want to hang out at my store for three weeks? Don't worry. I won't outstay my welcome. I have a job in Aspen in a month. Eric went to business school. He finished top in his class, okay? In fact, he's made a couple of suggestions that were implemented in my other businesses that helped very much. - He has? - Yes. You two kids have fun. [Stammers] Frank. Frank? He shot out of here like a rocket. [Sighs] - You provide free Wi-Fi here? - Of course. When you give people free Wi-Fi, do they buy books or food? Sometimes. Hey, you're home. So what was the big surprise? You are not going to believe it. So Frank's surprise was his son, who's gonna be "shadowing me" to learn about the store. - Why? - I don't know. He's learning all about Frank's businesses. Apparently, he's got "great ideas." That's a lot of air quotes. I don't want to talk about that right now. I want to talk about your wedding. I know it's thick, but it's got everything in there, from wedding dresses to bridesmaid dresses, venues, table settings, flowers. And I am planning all of this in weeks. That's why we're getting started now. So if you insist on having an obscure name, can you at least tell me that it serves a deeper purpose? The store is subtitled. Why does a store need a subtitle? Sorry. Explain, please? It's your vehicle to another world, because that's what barouches and books do. They are elegant forms of transportation. Stories allow us to understand what it's like to be someone else somewhere else, and that can be incredibly powerful. Hi, sorry, but I'm looking for Emma. That's her. No, she means the book, my namesake. It should be... Ah, right here. - Is this your first go at it? - Yeah. Well, get ready to fall in love with Mr. Knightley. That's what my english teacher said. [Both chuckle] - Thanks. - You're welcome. [Sighs] So envious when someone's about to read one of my favorites for the first time. What? Just trying to figure you out. I can see how being a hopeless romantic has helped you create this whole enchanting ambience. But I just wonder if it may also prevent you from seeing the real-world bottom line. You've known me two days, albeit two incredibly long days, but still. And you feel qualified to diagnose me as a hopeless romantic? All I am saying is that your fairy tale complex could be hindering your business decisions. My fairy tale complex? You don't believe in love or romance or happily ever after? Of course I believe in love. But romance and happily ever after have nothing to do with love. What is happening right now? Story time. [Children chatting] Hi, everybody. [Together] Hi, Book Lady. Are we ready to hear a story? [Together] Yeah. [Children giggling] Today's book is called Happy Spaghetti Day. [Children giggling] "Joey didn't like to wear his hat, not even when it was cold outside. Joey thought hats were no fun." [Phone ringing] Hey, what's up? Hey, just checking up on you. Well, I'm super hot, super dusty, but that's the glamorous world of construction, right? It sounds like it's going great. Hey, I'm really looking forward to seeing you tonight. Just takin' it easy and relax. Relax? No way. We've got a lot of wedding stuff to talk about. Absolutely, sweetie. Hey, let's talk later, okay? Okay. I'll talk to you later, hon. "Then mayor Anthony declared the day wear spaghetti on your head day. 'Just remember, ' he said, 'to leave off the tomato sauce.'" [children laughing] And that, my little friends, is the end for today. And there's only one last thing left for me to say. Thank you for joining. We had fun, indeed. Now go, find somewhere quiet, and enjoy a good read. [Laughter and clapping] Hey, everyone, guess what. From now on, for the half hour following story time, the book of the day will be 20% off. Kids, you should get your parents to buy it for you. Thanks for coming, everyone. I'll see you next time. [Together] Bye, Book Lady. What was that? It's a simple but solid marketing solution. I just told you that you can't come in here and start making decisions. - Excuse me. - I'm just gonna need a minute. Uh... Actually, I probably have some time. Oh! [Both laugh] I am so clumsy. I am so sorry. Is it all right if I say I'm not, my fair lady? - Uh... - [Laughs] Um, let me just... I'm Landon Kress. Emma. Emma Graham. I do not usually wear opera gloves. Well, I happen to like a woman with a flair for the elegant. [Laughs] Uh, thank you... [clears throat] I mean, how can I help you? What brought you into my store? - This is your store? - Mm-hmm. It's great. I wanted to peruse your poetry section. Huh, I don't know a lot of men who appreciate poetry. Well, I appreciate a lot of beautiful things. [Laughs] Well, yes, we have a poetry section. It's called poetic license. I love it. I'm looking for a copy of this one poem called the bouquet. - Have you heard of it? - Of course. A blossom pink, a blossom blue... Both: Make all there is in love so true. [Both chuckle] - Emma. - [Sighs] I will be right back. Thank you for participating in our story time deal. Eric, I just told you that you can't... I sold nine copies of the story time book. Nine? It's only been, like, five minutes. You're welcome. Hey there. Hi. Found it. I will take that. But what I'd really love is to take you to dinner. I think that's very possible. Here's your book. Thanks. Well, you'll be hearing from me very soon. [Sighs] [Door clicks] Hi. - Hey. - Is Greg here? No, but he will be here any minute. Okay, then I have a minute to tell you. - I met a guy. - [Gasps] [Doorbell dings] Oh. Come in, Greg. [Squeals] - Hey, honey. - Hey. You ready to wedding plan? [Chuckles] I can't. That's what I came to tell you. Bobby had a job he couldn't do, laying bathroom tile. Can it wait till tomorrow? No, the client wants the job to start tonight. It's good money, babe. I almost forgot. Got you something. Wiper blades. Yours are worn out. You won't be able to see the next time it rains. And I want my baby safe. I'll put them on tomorrow, okay? Hey, Emma. Oh, hey, Greg. Love you. [Door clicks] You okay? Huh? Yeah. Sure. He has to work. Forget Greg. Tell me about this new guy. Show me a picture. How would I have a picture of him? Welcome to the future, big sis. - It is called the Internet. - [Groans] You and Eric are obsessed with the Internet. He wants me to start a web site for the store. His name's Eric? No, Eric is... Forget Eric. The guy is Landon. Landon Kress. - Jane, you got your dress? - Yeah. I went to the secondhand store, and they had... It was just an amazing deal, so... Did you try on any others? I mean, how did you know it was the one? Well, Greg and I are on a tight budget and a strict timeline, so... You know what, it's gorgeous. And you'll be gorgeous. Thank you. Whoa. Speaking of gorgeous. He's been surfing in Costa Rica and to Paris. Oh, his family has a charity that saves homeless puppies. Landon Kress. I like this one. It's just right down this way on the top shelf. Is there a reason you're not using this space? I'm reserving it for a theater. Clearly, it's way too small for that. A puppet theater. I think it'll really make the section special. Kids can act out books and perform their own plays. That sort of thing really brings stories to life for them. So why haven't you done it? I've been saving up, but it's just a little too expensive right now. Well, I'll be sure to add it to the bottom of my list of necessary improvements. Thank you for prioritizing my life. Well, I'm simply saying that a large, unnecessary expense isn't really what you need right now. Well, I didn't ask you what I need right now. Well, hello, you two. - Hey, Dad. - Hi, Frank. Hi. Just thought I'd stop by and see how things were going. - Oh, just peachy. - Fine. Good. Emma, I wonder if you might give my son and I just a few seconds of privacy. Yes. So how is it going? Not good. No, Dad, not that, not the store. I mean, that's not great, but it's Emma. She's impossible. Son, you know why you are here. I need you to figure this out. [Phone beeping] [Beeping continues] [Sighs] Hey, Tommy, it's Greg. Yeah, man, doing okay, but if you have any extra work you could throw my way, I'd really appreciate it. [Chuckles] Yeah. Still working on it. So I could really use the extra dough. Yeah, man, anything. Even drywall. Okay. Please do. Thanks, man. Talk to you later? [Laughter] I don't remember any moves. Oh, I'll take that, pal. Thank you. No problem. Oh. Aw, Phil. You shouldn't have. - I didn't. - Oh, well, let's read the card. Emma, it's for you. "For the Book Goddess who I can't stop thinking about. L.K." - Mm. - [Laughs] You're the Book Goddess? I don't know. It's cute. It's because he forgot your name. [Scoffs] No, it's not. You know what? Just one minute. [Phone rings] - Hello. - Hi. It's Emma. Emma? Emma Graham from Barouche Books. Oh, Emma. My Book Goddess. - Hi. - Right. I just received this beautiful arrangement of flowers, and I just wanted to say thank you. Yeah, well, I just wanted to say hi and remind you of me. [Chuckles] Well, thank you very much. So, hey, are we on for our dinner date? You around tonight? How about 8:00? I did agree to go to dinner with you. Tonight would be perfect. I'm looking forward to seeing you again. Bye. Hmm. - Cookies? - What? Some days, you just need a cookie. Do you have a cookbook section? No. I guess I've always been more interested in fiction, narrative. Well, a cookbook can tell a narrative about the places the cuisine comes from, the experiences of a chef, harmony of ingredients. I take it you like to cook. Please, just make yourself at home. Thank you. So does the coffee klatch out there ever actually buy anything? Is this how you observe? That's funny, 'cause when I do it, I'm a lot quieter. [Sighs] And, you know, you shouldn't be so rude. Phil and Marilyn are both former english professors. They're knowledgeable, and they love literature. They're the perfect people to work here. In fact, I'm thinking of having them host a class or a book club or something. Yeah, that's a great idea, actually. And in the meantime, I'm gonna need some blog entries soon. Some blog entries? To give this store an online presence, which it sorely needs. To give that presence a personality, set it apart from other bookstores. Look, if you think my store needs a web site, and now the web site needs a blog, then you can write it. You can do it once you stop being afraid of it. Who said I was afraid? You can do it, Emma. You just need to mention new arrivals, old favorites. Talk about the books that you love and why. Share yourself and your life, how you believe in the power of a good story. Start tonight. I'll edit your first few entries while my web guy works on the web site. I have a date tonight, remember? So your personal life is more important than your bookstore? [Huffs] Emma, wait. [Sighs] Okay, okay, I take that back. But how about a little wager? What are you talking about? How about if after one month, you're still interested in captain flower arrangement, I'll personally buy you your puppet theater. But if you have predictably kicked him to the curb, then you put something useful in that space and basically agree to all my genius ideas. Wouldn't it be easier if I just gave you a gold star so you could show Frank what a great job you're doing? So you're afraid to take the bet. No, it sounds like a safe bet to me. I know I'm still gonna be interested in Landon. He's a man who understands the subtle art of romance. There is nothing subtle about this guy. Spoken like a true cranky cynic. Do we have a bet? We do. Okay. "What makes Barouche Books different? Why do stories matter?" [Sighs] [Sighs] I can't write a blog, Jane. Especially not when I have a date with the most perfect man in just a few hours. You type. I will pick out your outfit. I don't even know what Eric wants. And I can't ask him, because he's so rude and condescending and pushy and uptight. Wow, why don't you write about how much you dislike Eric? You clearly have plenty of inspiration there. You have a date with a handsome, well-traveled, romantic man, and all you can do is talk about how annoying Frank's son is. I'm sorry. I am the worst maid of honor ever. I'll finish this later tonight. Let's just forget Eric and this whole dumb blog and let's do some wedding planning. No. Tomorrow. Right now we are getting you ready for your date. So where is he taking you? I don't know. It's a surprise. Hmm. This guy keeps getting better and better. Jane, he can't see you spying on him. [Doorbell dings] [Squeals] Okay. Good night, Jane. [Door clicks] Watch your step. Thank you. - Comfortable? - Yes. [Engine turns over] - [Sighs] - It's pretty here. - Yeah, pretty flowers. - Yeah. [Both laugh] You look nice, by the way. Thank you. [Laughs] Surprised? A picnic? A very fancy moonlit picnic. [Chuckles] It's wonderful. Here you go. Thank you. How did you do all of this? Oh, I have my ways. [Chuckles] You know, I don't believe in doing anything if you can't completely commit. Well, I completely agree. - Here you go. - Thank you. You're welcome. Well... [Clears throat] To the Book Goddess. You know, people actually call me the Book Lady. I know. I'm calling you a goddess. Mmm. So do you travel often? I do. I do, actually. I enjoy seeing the world. My last big trip was to Costa Rica for a month. Costa Rica? How exotic. What did you do there? A lot. And not much. [Both chuckle] I mean, some days, I would sit on the beach for hours and just read poetry. That sounds like heaven. Yeah? Well, I don't think I can replicate the beaches of Costa Rica, but I think this setting is pretty fantastic too, at least to me. [Chuckles] What would you like to hear? I don't know. Surprise me. How about our poem from the day we met? "A blossom pink, a blossom blue, make all there is in love so true." Okay. Well, thank you for allowing me the honor of your company tonight. And thank you for creating such a memorable evening. Well, here's a secret. - I was trying to impress you. - [Laughs] Well, mission accomplished. Uh... Can I call you? You better. Well, here's the number you called me from. Is that your cell? - Yeah, that's me. - Okay. Then I will save this so that I can call you and invite you to a proper dinner. [Both laugh] And when you call, should I save your name as Landon Kress, Prince Charming? I've been called worse. [Chuckles] Well, good night, Emma. Good night, Landon. [Sighs] [Sighs] All right, Eric, here I go. "What makes Barouche Books different? Why do stories matter?" Delete, delete, delete. "My sister Jane and I were raised on a steady diet of fish sticks and fairy tales. But the thing no one tells you, you have to meet a lot of slimy toads before the guy with the crown comes along... Rude, self-satisfied toads with smug, irritating little smiles. Do you know why, dear reader? Because like any protagonist in a fairy tale or a great novel, you must take a journey. Challenge your antagonist. That's one lesson I learned from the many books I've read in my lifetime. What might you learn through a story? Where will you travel? You'll never know until you stop in and visit us at Barouche Books." Yay, bravo. That was beautiful, Emma. If you'd taken my class, I would've given it an "A." - [Laughs] - You know what? I am giving it an "A." Thanks, Phil. Dad, what did you think of Emma's blog entry? - I thought it was enchanting. - Eric? It works. It was great, actually. Heartfelt and personal, engaging. Oh. Thanks. Okay. I have to be running along, but I like this. I like this a lot. [Sighs] All right. What did you think of Dean? He seemed like a nice guy. I'm sure he'll do a good job. Well, we're not necessarily hiring him for our wedding. We're not? Why? We have to meet a couple people first. I mean, the next guy on the list is cheaper. Okay, let's pick him. But the photos might not be as good. Honey, you're already so photogenic. You know, you're gonna be more beautiful than ever on our wedding day, and anyone with a camera will be able to capture that. Greg, what are you doing? Sorry, I put a bid in on a kitchen redo. This woman has questions. Must you take every job you're offered? Can't you have a day off? I don't want to lose momentum on this side business. Really, any photographer you want, okay? [Children giggling] Thank you for coming. [Together] Bye, Book Lady. I'll see you all next time. Buy today's book, 20% off. You know, you could be a little more elegant with the way you do that. I know. I know. You like a lot of pomp and circumstance, flowers and picnics. Is Langston gonna ask you out again via skywriting? - Landon. - Whatever. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about your cookbook section. I don't have one, remember? I know, but I think you should add one. You could even call it "What's Cooking?" Oh, and add it to my adorable pun-based organizational system? If we created a cookbook section, you could introduce it to customers with a big event, like perhaps throwing a book-signing party. Invite local press, get some new customers into the store. You could expand your clientele and put Barouche Books on the map. But who's gonna do a book signing here? Caroline Lake. The owner and chef at Caroline's on Belwood? Yeah, she's putting out her first cookbook. That's a four-star restaurant. Yeah, because it's really good. No, I mean, Caroline Lake is already a name. She doesn't need my little store. I'll ask her. She's an old friend. Well, let me know what she says. You sure you want to take one of my suggestions before you absolutely have to? We still have three weeks left on that Latham bet. His name is Landon. Landon? Did somebody say Landon? A deliveryman brought this for you. It's from him. Huh. He wants to take me out again. He couldn't just call? Wow. This is so unexpected. And very interesting. Probably very expensive. No doubt about that. You know what I like about it most? It's evidence. Mm. It's evidence that I am going to get my puppet theater. That's the one I want. And I'd like my office back in three weeks. So call Caroline. Let's do this. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm on my way over. All right, thanks, man. [Knocking at door] Yeah, it's open. Come on in. - Hey, honey. - Hey. What's up? What do you mean, what's up? I'm here to pick you up. For our cake-tasting appointment with the baker? That's today? - I totally forgot. - You're kidding. Tommy just texted me about a job across town, and I'm gonna be late if I don't head out now. No, we are going to be late if we don't head out right now. Well, sorry. I just hung up with him. I told him I'd be there for him. I promised him. - Greg, you promised me too. - I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. I forgot. Why don't you call Emma and pick her up on the way over? Because I'm not marrying Emma. Look, I'm gonna love whatever you choose. Okay? Surprise me. I can't believe you're making me pick out our wedding cake alone. Just call Emma. I mean, you guys will have fun. You have the whole afternoon off, right? Just make a whole girls' day of it or something. I have to go to work. I'm gonna be there till at least 8:00, okay? I'll call you on the way home. Maybe we can meet up for a late burger or something, okay? Mm. Seriously, I have to go. You can tell me about everything later today, okay? I love you. [Phone rings] - Hey. - Hey. Are you free? How about sampling a dozen cakes with me this morning? I have blog entries to work on. And if I do it now, I can actually use my own desk. Well, did you eat already? Because you're gonna have to eat at some time. I'll throw in a vat of coffee. I will even pick you up. Wait, where is Greg? Isn't the cake-tasting appointment the only one guys typically enjoy? He forgot. Okay. I'll be there. [Whispering] Time to indulge, ladies. First up, we have a lemon-raspberry mousse and chocolate-hazelnut crunch. Enjoy. Yum. These remind me of the petit fours that Landon had at our picnic. Mmm, unreal. I'm pretty sure Greg has no idea what a petit four is. [Laughs] So tell me about him. Where did he grow up? Where did he go to school? I have no idea. Isn't that pretty standard first date conversation? It is. But it wasn't really a very standard first date. Well, what did you guys talk about? Well, we read poetry. And we talked about our favorite books and songs, our favorite places to travel. Next up, almond amaretto and dark chocolate peanut butter. Mmm, thank you. Do you have anything with coconut? Of course. I thought Greg hates coconut. Oh, does he? [Laughs] Can we plan a double date with Landon? Absolutely. Maybe Landon will rub off on him. Landon will be a great influence on him. If Eric wasn't such a judgmental grump, then maybe Landon could rub off on him, teach him how to be a gentleman. Okay, that's it. I have to see who this guy is. What's his last name, Donovan? Not this guy. He's, like, 80. Eric Donovan the podiatrist? Definitely not. The ceo of Eric Donovan and company consulting? No, I don't think so. Well, it says here they specialize in in-crisis businesses. No, it can't be the same guy. No, Frank's son is just playing at business with his father's investments. In a couple of weeks, he's gonna be flitting off to Aspen. Is it this guy? He's cute. Well, shall we share a starter or two? Sure. Do you like artichokes? They have this remoulade on the side. Oh, no, no, no. I forgot. I preordered the chevre crostinis. Oh, they come with this amazing lavender honey drizzled on top. It is, oh, decadent. Okay. [Sighs] Do you not like the menu? You want to go somewhere else? Oh, no. No, no, it's great. Actually, I don't even know what's on the menu. I've been reading the word amuse-bouche over and over again. I'm sorry, Landon. I'm just a little distracted. Well, once you have the crostini, you won't be able to think of anything else. [Both chuckle] Oh, and save room for dessert, because the souffle here is perfection. Right. Souffle. Hey, do you remember Eric from my store? He was the guy who sold you that book of poetry when we first met. Yeah. Well, he's been sort of helping with Barouche Books. But I have reason to believe he thinks my store is in trouble, and I'm really worried about it. And he is just so difficult to talk to. I don't even know how to broach the subject. What do you think? Well, I think we should order. Excuse me? Emma, we're just getting to know each other. We should be having fun, not wallowing in boring work talk. Look, besides, the best way to get over a rough day is to have a wonderful evening. Emma, when I look into your amazingly beautiful eyes, I don't want to see worry. Okay, I want to make you happy. Our time together is... Well, it's precious. So we should make the most of it. [Both chuckle] Well, that's true. - To us. - To us. Oh. [Laughs] Thank you. [Loon calls] [Somber music] ♪ ♪ [Emma narrating] One of the reasons I love literature so much is, it's a heightened version of real life, heroes and villains and surprising plot twists. But sometimes that plot twist is a scary one. In a book, it's exciting, intriguing. ♪ ♪ In real life, it's just terrifying. Trust me, you won't regret this. Barouche Books is not just your average bookstore. It's memorable, just like your book will be. Great. Send over the paperwork. I'll take a look. Okay. So I was just speaking to... Okay, wow. You look interesting. I didn't get much sleep last night. Should I assume that since you were out late with what's-his-face that you don't have a new blog entry either? Is a new blog entry gonna help save my store? - What? - I looked you up, Eric. You're not just here to learn about your father's investments. You're the ceo of an entire company that specializes in failing businesses. Yes. You've been lying to me this entire time. [Scoffs] - I think it's very cute. - [Murmuring] Only your mother, only your mother. Very. Be careful. - Yeah. - You be careful. How strong can you make an Espresso, Marilyn? Oh, dear. Something wrong, Emma? No. Nothing's wrong. Everything's awesome. You just need a really strong Espresso. So you can enjoy the awesomeness. Right. Latte or cappuccino? One of each. Right. To go. So tell me, how bad is it? It's fixable. Without some considerable changes, you'll be in serious trouble within six months. How could I have not known that? Most people don't see it coming. They justify income fluctuations, attribute it to various factors, some of which are valid, some of which aren't. You're in it, Emma, day to day. As long as you can pay everyone each month, keep your doors open, make a small profit, you think you're doing okay. Yeah. The problem is, is that you have no plan in case things start going badly. Online sales have threatened a lot of businesses. But bookstores are disappearing faster than any other brick-and-mortar. Look, don't beat yourself up just because you didn't see it coming. This is what I do. That doesn't really make me feel any better. How about this? Back when my dad was first considering investing in your store, I urged him to pass. You really don't understand how to comfort people, do you? My point being is that all I was looking at, in your words, was the balance sheet. But I get it now. Barouche Books is more than just another bookstore. - Your place is special. - Great. So I won't be the only person who misses it when it goes down in flames. Look, do you want to fix this, or do you want to wallow in self-pity? - I want to fix it. - Good. Then let's fix this. I really think that this cookbook signing could set a lot in motion for you. Just like your idea of having Phil and Marilyn host book clubs, this is a way to show people that Barouche is a destination, different than any bookstore they've ever been in. Okay. What do we have to do? Well, I think we need to buy some scanners and software, digitally catalogue your inventory, bring the bookstore into the 21st century. Then we'll create a big sale for the day of the signing. We'll create a cookbook section. And, you know, just plan the best cookbook signing anyone's ever seen. [Laughing] Okay, let's do it. We can do that. I mean, we can do it, right? It sounds pretty involved and expensive. Well, that's why we're going to my dad's office. Your dad's office? You coming? Emma, I apologize that I wasn't more up front with you about why I was bringing Eric into the store, but I didn't want to needlessly alarm you if there was nothing to worry about. Well, that's why we're here, Dad. - It is? - It is. Because I know that you're not only committed to keeping Barouche Books' doors open but to making it more successful. - I am. - And we have a plan to do that. But we're gonna need to buy some equipment and supplies, so it's gonna take a little more investment capital. I'm listening. Barouche Books is not just a store. It's a destination. It's warm and inviting, with an incredible charm and a quirky personality. But unfortunately, very few people know about it. But we have a plan to introduce the city to Emma's store, make it clear that Barouche Books is not just a place to buy a book, but it's the place to bring your kids to story time, to get an insightful and personal recommendation from the Book Lady herself. It'll get new customers into the store. It'll get us some press. And with Emma's blog and her web site, we'll have a distinctive online presence. Over time, I think this will really help to boost business. Great plan. I think we should do it. Really? [Scanner beeping] And that's one. And two. It's not gonna make it any easier. [Laughs] That's true. Okay, well, let's talk business. We need to order a bunch of cookbooks for the new section. I talked to Caroline's publisher. They're gonna give you a deal on a dozen of their publications. We should call a few other places too just to round out the section. Oh, wow. That's a really great start. You know, I was actually thinking that for the party, we could have the waiters serving appetizers from Caroline's cookbook. And they could say things like, "would you like to try a bacon-wrapped fig from page 23?" - That's really smart, Emma. - Thank you. [Puppy whimpering] Well, she is very smart. Landon. What are you doing here? With a puppy. - [Chuckles] - Hello. Oh, you're the cutest thing I've ever seen. Hi there. Landon, he is adorable. I thought I'd bring you a little visitor, right? No one can be stressed out when they're playing with a puppy. - No, they can't. - Right? No, they can't. Thank you so much. Come back and see us again. Thanks, will do. Honey, where did you put the new coffee filters? Under the counter. Look. [Puppy whimpering] Aw. Oh, Landon, you remember Eric, right? Sure. Hey. So, listen, I thought we could play with this guy for a little bit, and then we could drop him off at the rescue and take a drive up the coast in my convertible. Then we can take a walk on the beach. And then we can go to this hole-in-the-wall seafood restaurant for dinner. Best oysters you'll ever have. Landon, that sounds incredible, but I'm gonna be here all night. We have so much work to do. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I shouldn't even have bothered you at work. Oh, no. No, it was really nice. Why don't we plan something else? Actually, I was thinking it might be nice for you to meet my sister and her fiance. Think we could do a double date this week? Yeah, I'd love to meet your family. Great. Okay, bye, little guy. Mwah. Can I get one of those? Uh... Yeah. Well, it was really good to see you, Emma. You know, five minutes with you is better than hours with so many other people. Hey, say, farewell, Book Goddess. [Both laugh] - Bye. - Good-bye. Bye. [Giggles] Sorry. Back to work. So what about you? What got you into consulting? Between undergrad and business school, I got a lot of different jobs and internships to figure out what aspect of the business world I wanted to get into. And it became clear pretty fast that what I excelled at was problem solving. Do you like it at least? Sometimes, absolutely. Other times, I wonder... What? You don't care about this. Yes, I do. Other times, I just wonder if I move from job to job criticizing other people's ideas because I never figured out what truly inspired me. Or maybe it's the opposite. You're too good at too many things to settle on just one. - That's unnecessarily kind. - [Chuckles] You clearly like helping people. Clearly? I know you care about what happens to me. With the store. Right. We should get back to the books. I'm not going anywhere. Isn't that the problem? [Laughs] Yes, it is. She's probably fine, Jane. Well, she never came home last night, Greg. Emma. Oh. Hey. I was worried sick about you. You never came home last night. I called you, I texted you, and you never responded. I'm sorry. The phone battery died. Hi. You must be Emma's sister. I'm Eric. Hi. Nice to meet you. This is my fiance, Greg. What you guys doing? Well, Eric is Frank's son. He's helping her with the store. In the middle of the night. While sleeping. Stop. We were just scanning books for digital inventory. Yeah, we were just gonna take a nap around 2:00 and finish, but... Eric, Emma, you're here. Oh, they slept here. Frank, I am so, so sorry I called you. I was having a panic attack. I guess I shouldn't be surprised she was here. We were just doing inventory. All right, honey, let's go. Now that Emma's not trapped in an elevator or kidnapped or worse, we have things to do. Oh, and I thought that I was the dramatic one. Oh, Jane, Landon stopped by, and I suggested we go on a double date some night this week. - Sure. - Oh. The great Landon in the flesh. Emma won't stop talking to Jane about him. And Jane won't stop talking to me about him. Come on. All right, so maybe we can finish up the inventory, and then when Marilyn and Phil get here, we can both run home and take showers. - I have to go, actually. - Oh? To Aspen. Yeah, I got a couple of logistics to figure out before the job starts. Not really sure when I'll be back. You'll be back in time for the book signing though, right? Yeah, sure. Of course. I'll leave you a to-do list and all the contact numbers for the publishers. I'm sure you can handle it. I'll see you later, Dad. [Emma narrating] As in all my favorite stories, there are moments in life where you're not quite sure what will happen next. New ideas... - Hi there. - Hi. [Narrating] New people. - Hungry? - You brought me lunch? Yup. [Narrating] It can be challenging, but it's how you meet those challenges. Ah, that's the exciting part. [Gasps] Oh, I love these. Look. [Emma narrating] Of course, old concerns and times of doubt. But what I do know is that in my story, I'm the Book Lady of Barouche Books. [Chuckles] And no one can change that. [Hawk screeches] [Emma narrating] And if you want to meet me or the many writers who inhabit the shelves of my store, please come join us next Friday night for a once-in-a-lifetime cookbook signing and cocktail party for esteemed local chef Caroline Lake. You won't regret it. Wow. I know, right? The food here is fantastic. We should order a few appetizers to share. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Actually, I was looking at the prices. But, yeah, everything sounds delicious. Oh, well, like my mom always says, one doesn't talk about money. [Chuckles] Please, guys, order whatever you want. - Tonight's on me. - Oh, you don't have to do that. I insist. Really, you don't have to do that. Well, it's my pleasure. So em was telling me you guys are having a wedding ceremony in a park. We actually grew up playing there. Literally every day after school. Mm-hmm, Emma always got to wear the princess dresses and made me be the prince in the boring old cape. Older sisters are kind of bossy. What can I say? Either way, it was a very special place for me, which is why we chose it. Well, a toast to the wedding day. Mm. This time, you get to be the princess. Oh, how sweet, Landon. Thank you. You are such a gentleman. Honey, save some bread for everyone else. - Maybe he's just hungry. - I don't blame you, buddy. It's good stuff, huh? You got to try the balsamic and oil, I'm telling you. - A bite for the Book Goddess. - [Chuckles] [Laughing] You should have some. It's really good. That was nice. I enjoyed meeting them. It was nice. And it was good for me to get away from the store for a couple of hours. Although I have to admit, my to-do list is running through my brain right now. I just have so much to get done for the book signing. I have to finish the display windows. I need to finalize the hors d'oeuvres menu. I need to make sure that the place is... Emma, would it be okay if we left the work talk at the store? It kind of feels like every time I need to talk about the store, you're not interested in listening. No, it's not that. Well, then what is it? Here. Emma, relationships take time and commitment. You know, I feel like I've done everything I can to show you how I feel about you. You know, we haven't spent any time together this week, and tonight I had to share you with your sister and her fiance. I thought that you wanted to meet them. No, I did. But now I want to be with you. I guess what I'm trying to say, em, is that... I'm crazy about you. [Yawns] How're you holding up, sweetie? Just barely, but I am. I'm gonna bring you a coffee. Oh, thank you. And I think I'll have some of my gross childhood cookies, Eric. [Soft music] ♪ ♪ Eric. - Would you like some more? - Sure. Oh, lovely. Oh, Emma, I would've brought you your coffee. I just needed some air, not coffee. Well, coffee shop air, not office air. You know what I mean. What's going on over there, ladies? Another gorgeous bouquet of flowers from L.K. It sounds like this Landon's a keeper, huh? All right, ladies, let's let Emma get back to work. And besides, it's time to start our inaugural Barouche Books book club. Will I be seeing everybody at the book signing at the end of the week? Can't wait. Do we get to meet Landon? Sit down, Sadie. Now, has everybody finished reading the book? - Yes. - Mm-hmm. Well, who wants to start? Well, we're gonna need at least three servers. They can wear Barouche Books t-shirts? Okay. Great. Thanks so much. [Sighs] Sounds like a lot's getting done around here. Hi. Yes, it is. I didn't know you were coming back today. Last-minute decision. He's lucky you don't have allergies. [Laughs] So how was Aspen? Aspen was snowy. Doesn't matter. So how are you? I don't mean this to sound like a jerk, but you look a little tired. I am pretty tired. But Jane and I made dinner plans tonight to unwind, so that should help a bit. Good. I saw you got a new blog entry up promoting the signing. Very nicely done. You read it? Well, thank you. Speaking of Aspen, I bought something while I was there. I popped into this rare bookstore for research to see what they were doing to capture a niche market, and couldn't resist. [Soft music] ♪ ♪ It's a rare edition of Emma. Eric, this is so... It's nothing. This is the exact opposite of nothing. [Phone rings] It's Jane. Hello. Emma, would it be okay if I bail tonight? Greg and I both finally have an evening off together, and we were thinking we should assemble wedding programs and work on the seating chart. Your wedding is in less than two weeks. Don't worry about me. Okay. Well, as long as you're sure. Hey, give me that. Hey. I personally want to thank you, Emma, for making this evening possible. I'm sure this time spent tying ribbons and making place cards will be some of the most enjoyable hours of my life. You are so dead. - Okay. - Jane canceled on dinner? Yeah, she's spending some much-needed quality time with Greg. It's just as well. There's so much to do. No, you still need a break. Come on. Why don't I make up something? Where? - Here. - Here? Come on. You had to wear the headgear to school? For all of seventh grade. I had a really bad overbite. I'm sure you had those perfect teeth all along. Are you kidding? I had to wear braces for two whole years. And I used to change the rubber bands to go with the holidays. Red and green for Christmas, red, white, and blue for the Fourth of July. I'm sure it was very fetching. It was around the same time that I was dyeing my hair clown-wig orange. - Why? - I don't know. I was experimenting with my individuality. Your mom should've been stricter. So what are we making here? - A tartine. - What? A French open-faced sandwich. I've taken a plain ham and cheese sandwich, added some tomato and honey mustard dressing from the salad. And now I'm going to melt it all together. And we'll have a little green salad on the side. Mm, that is some impressive improvisation. I don't even know how to throw an omelet together. Well, you should let me teach you sometime. You come over, and I could give you a little Cooking 101 lesson. Really? - That would be fun. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, great. It's a date. I thought... Eric, I'm seeing Landon. I mean, we're still seeing each other. And I mean, I... Yeah, you still want him hanging around. I get it. I lost the bet. [Toaster oven clicking] [Bell dings] That's the sandwiches. We should probably eat and get back to work. [Sighs] [Candy rattling] [Sniffles] Jane? What's wrong? Greg. But you sounded like you were laughing and having so much fun on the phone. I know. And then he got another call, and he took another job. He said it'd be super fast, but of course, it wasn't, and now I finished all of the wedding programs by myself. Lately, he has just been so impatient and, I don't know, disinterested. Well, I mean, all relationships have their phases, right? And you guys are both really stressed because of the wedding. No, no. I am stressed precisely because he doesn't seem to care. I mean, when somebody loves you, they're supposed to be invested in the things that interest you, right? Even if it doesn't particularly interest them too. Don't you think? Yeah, I do. Yeah. Oh, I didn't see you come in. Just double-checking everything. You should touch base with every vendor that's highlighted there to confirm for tomorrow. Okay. Professional cleaning crew should be coming in tonight after you close, and if you want them to come back after the party, they'll give you a deal. - Great. - That should cover everything. Are you leaving already? I was hoping I could talk to you about yesterday. Pretty good sandwich, right? Eric, what I mean is, I wanted to... - Hey there. - Landon. What are you doing here? We said we were gonna grab some lunch today. I am so sorry. I completely forgot. Well, that's why my girl needs some time off, right? I'll see you for the party tomorrow, Emma. - I... - Enjoy your lunch. - We ready? - Yeah. [Emma narrating] When Cinderella went to the prince's ball, she had no idea her life was about to change. She just really needed a night out. [Sighs] When Rapunzel was stuck in her tower bedroom, she didn't know that one night, she was gonna be saved by her true love. But I know that tonight could affect the rest of my life, my livelihood, my dreams, my future. [Sighs] No pressure, right? Looks like a great crowd. Can we expect more events like this in the future? Well, first of all, I'd like to thank Caroline Lake for coming here to do the signing, because obviously, her being here has already kicked Barouche Books into high gear. Ready for this, kiddo? As ready as I'll ever be. The place looks beautiful, and the food is delicious. This is gonna be a big hit. I really hope so. I should check my list though. Do you guys think I've forgotten something? I've probably forgotten something. Don't worry. You're fine. There's George. We better go mingle. The place looks incredible. Thanks. - You have your speech ready? - What speech? You have to introduce Caroline. What? No. That wasn't on the list. It's not a big deal, Emma. You just say a few words. It's not a big deal? That's the biggest deal ever. Breathe, please. [Breathes deeply] Come with me. You can't really be worried about this, Emma. This is the easy part. I fail to see that. All you have done since I met you is talk passionately about how much you love this store, why you created it, what you want it to be. You've been telling me for weeks. Now just tell them. I'm just... I'm just scared, okay? I know. But there's no doubt in my mind that you can do this. This place looks beautiful. And... Well, so do you. Thank you. Emma, we're ready to start. Go get 'em. - Hey. - Hi. Hi, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight. I'd also like to thank renowned local chef Caroline Lake. She and I actually have a lot in common. We both built businesses out of nothing so that we could do the things that we loved. Although, admittedly, she's a tad more successful than I am. [Laughter] All I can say is, I love this place. It's a celebration of life. It used to be that that celebration was just on the pages of the many books that we sell here, stories about the most important moments in our lives, love, friendship and family, fears and adventures, mistakes and victories. But now Barouche Books is also a place to celebrate your lives, and we're starting by honoring Caroline Lake and one of the proudest moments in her life, the publication of her very first cookbook. - Emma. - Hi. Oh... - You were so great. - Thanks. Hey, you want to go grab something to eat? You know, I should actually go talk to my guests and mingle. Oh, okay. Well, I'll be around. Okay, yeah. - This is amazing. - And the food too. Could you guys hold on a minute? - I'll be right back. - Mm-hmm. Emma, you did it. You did it. It's great. It's a beautiful night. Books are flying off the shelves. They're selling like crazy. And two people actually asked me if they could rent this place for their very own events. - That's great. - Yeah. Where's Eric? He had to go work... work stuff. Really? I didn't think he'd leave right in the middle of the party. No, but I think this whole thing just took a little more out of him than he expected. [Emma narrating] So thanks to all of you, the book signing was a big success and things are really looking up for Barouche Books. But tonight, standing there with everyone I care about around me... Well, almost everyone... I started to wonder how Cinderella felt after she got all the things she'd ever dreamed of... Was it everything she hoped it would be? I never really thought about that before. Janey, honey, this is my third message. You were supposed to meet me here an hour ago. I'm getting worried. Look, I know I've been working too much and I haven't been around, but... I can explain. Just please call me, text me, anything. Just let me know you're okay. I love you. [Beep] Deliveries! Ta-dum. [Sighs] Oh, come on. Has Landon spoiled you so much that you can't appreciate a beautiful bouquet of flowers? I know. He's great, but... - But? - Wait... Did you say deliveries, plural? I really can't believe that Landon sent something else. Eric thinks he lost the bet. What bet? He told me that if in a month's time, I still wanted Landon around, then he'd buy me my puppet theater. And did you lose the bet? No. I mean, I don't know. Landon is the perfect guy. He's everything I ever wanted, and... You're not happy. No. How awful is that? Oh, it's not so awful. It's not your fault you fell for somebody else. Eric may not be sending you flowers, but he's been there when it really counted. How could I have been so stupid? [Laughs] [Phone rings] Huh. It's Greg. Well, you take it. We'll talk later. Okay. - Hello? - Has Jane called you? Is something wrong? She's gone. What do you mean, she's gone? I mean, she didn't show up at our last meeting with the minister. She's not at the house. I've called her cell a dozen times. Okay, don't panic here, Greg. What am I supposed to do? Where could she be? I'm freaking out over here. Okay, don't worry. Look, I'm sure there's an explanation. She's been under a lot of stress lately. Yeah, I know. Probably caused by me. Okay, I am gonna call you back. Sit tight... I may have an idea where she could be. [Goose honking] He called you? Of course he called me. What's going on, Janey? Last night, when Landon rushed over to kiss you... I'm breaking up with Landon. What? What are you talking about? He's perfect. [Laughs] There's no such thing as perfect. Truth is, yes, Landon is thoughtful and romantic, but not in any of the ways that matter. Flowers die. Fancy dinners are just that, fancy dinners. None of it means anything. And the stuff that does matter... Landon's not really interested in that stuff. But Greg, he is the guy who drives around with you at the crack of dawn trying to find your crazy sister when her phone battery died. [Both laugh] He loves you so much, Janey. You should've heard him on the phone. He is in a panic. He's so afraid that he's lost you. You always thought I was so silly, waiting around for my Prince Charming. And you were right. I had it all backwards. The perfect guy doesn't just appear and change your life like in the fairy tales. You and the perfect guy bring your fairy tale to life together. And Greg has always done that for you. Yeah. Thanks, big sister. Come here. This is a really beautiful spot to have a wedding. We grew up here together, Jane. It would be a shame to waste it. [Both laugh] Yeah. Okay. Get out of here. Hey. Are you busy right now? Here. Please sit. Um... Jane, I am so sorry. You deserved more. More of me, more of my time, more of everything. And I'm sorry I messed up. Hold on. Where are you going? ♪ ♪ When we got engaged, I knew that you were the perfect woman for me. That's why I've been jumping on every job that comes along.

I spent a lot of my childhood here. And it's also where I cultivated this... Misguided Prince Charming fantasy that I've been carrying around with me my whole life. Well, it doesn't have to be a fantasy, Emma. I mean, I thought I was doing... I thought you were too. But in all my years waiting for my perfect romantic man, it never really occurred to me whether or not I was actually romantic. I mean, the flowers, the picnics, poetry, and the puppy... [Chuckles] It's true. It's everything I've always wanted. But? But... It's just not what I needed. Hmm. I didn't think I could ever go wrong with a puppy. [Laughs] You didn't do anything wrong. You just have to wait for the right woman. Take care, Landon. All right. Bye. Bye. Marilyn, he hasn't called, has he? He who? - Eric. - Oh, no, sweetie, I'm sorry. He hasn't. Okay. [Phone rings] - Yeah. - Hi, Frank. It's Emma. Well, hello, Emma. - How are you? - I'm okay. I've been trying to get a hold of Eric, but he hasn't been returning my calls. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. He's just been a little overwhelmed lately. But I tell you what, I'm happy to pass on a message if you'd like. Okay. Thanks, Frank. You're welcome, Emma. You're not gonna call her back, are you? There's nothing left to say, Dad. The job's finished. I'm moving on to the next one. Son, I realize that you're used to moving from job to job.
