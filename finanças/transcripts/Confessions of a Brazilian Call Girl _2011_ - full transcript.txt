- Bruna Surfistinha - Confessions of a Brazilian Call Girl BASED UPON THE BOOK BY RAQUEL PACHECO: "THE SCORPIONS'S SWEET VENOM" Raquel, sensually yours. I'm not telling this story to apologize... Or to explain the reason I left. Especially because the only people I wanted forgiveness from I left behind that night. When my parents woke up the next day, I wasn't there anymore. Come in. Sit down, kiddo. What's up? I called yesterday. Raquel. Oh, what a surprise! You came to see the place? Yeah, I figured I could stay, try it out. See how things work. Let me look at you. Any experience? Sit here, kiddo. You're a pretty thing, huh... It's all right, sweetie. I'll let you stay. We'll see how the month goes, and then we'll get your paperwork in order. Are you going to sign paperwork? Sure, so you can receive your benefits, pension, Christmas bonus, retirement fund­ Just kiddin', silly. The deal is simple: each trick lasts one hour for 100 reais. 40 is yours and 60 goes to the house, right? One hour for 100 reais. 40 is yours and 60 goes to the house. If you change your sheets too much, you'll pay for laundry, ok? - Ok? - Ok. Let's go meet the girls. Did you choose that name, Raquel? It's kind of lame. Get another, ok? Let's go, sweetie. Look at this woman's fake boobs. They don't even move. - Let me see. - Nice. Look at that! We work the whole day. Come in. We're open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sundays are off. Rush hour is during the day. Girls, she's going to replace Joyce. Here you can wash your clothes, get dressed, wait for a client... Understand? The lockers are over there, one for each girl. Not much space, but it's enough. Thanks, honey. You should all go to sleep, tomorrow is the 10th, our busiest day. It always scared me to spend the night away from my home. I'd want to leave in the middle of the night. Suddenly, I was somewhere I didn't know very well, sharing a room with three call girls that I'd never seen before. Which class do you have today? Several, mom. It's not just one. Hey folks! Good morning, son. Let's go to the game on Sunday? - Yeah, sure. - Great! Be careful, you're going to get your clothes dirty. Don't worry, mom, she's already kind of dirty. Rodrigo! "Write is a way of saying what can't be said. Revealing what we don't like about ourselves. Giving this to the reader as an ugly gift, that we give away expecting nothing in return." Hey, class. Gabriela and Luciana are up next week. Hey, did you get my text? Yeah. So, let's study at my place today? I don't know. I won't be able to stay long. It's not a lot. It won't take long. It'll be quick. Hi. Hi, I managed to show up. I'm glad you're here. Let's go inside. My room, Raquel. Raquel, my room. Make yourself comfortable. Should we study the whole book or only the last two chapters? I forgot my book at school. No problem, we can study with mine. No, no. I want to kiss you. We better study. I can't stay for long. I said I was coming home for lunch. Just a little kiss. Come here. Come on. - Do something for me. - Wait, calm down. Come on, come closer. Come closer. Here. Come on. Come on. Keep going. This is what you came for. Enough! Get off! You can't stop now. You gonna leave me hanging? Jerk! Why don't you do to me what you did to Felipe? Blow me till I'm done. You fucking nerd. Honey, did you decide on your school trip? It's this weekend. Have you talked to your father? Everyone's going. I still need to pay. Let's change the subject, Celeste? - As usual... - As usual you fuck things up. Have you thought about studying, going to college? Trying to become someone. And now you're complaining, "I'm not going on the school trip­" - Rodrigo, please. - Mom, I have to... Rodrigo! Let's change the subject, Celeste. LOADING HI, RAQUEL, CHECK MY PROFILE, I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU. YESTERDAY, I HAD A GREAT TIME STUDYING! IF YOU WANT A STUDY PARTNER, I RECOMMEND HER! LOL. Asshole, son of a bitch. - Raquel, have you... - Can't you knock? Have you seen the jewelry your father gave me? The ones from the wedding? Yes, from our anniversary. It must be in the closet. That's where you keep them. Raquel, are you sure you don't know where it is? No. RAQUEL'S A COCKSUCKER Ms. Larissa! Client! No need to yell, I see who comes in. Remember, sweetie, my monitor? Look who's still alive. It's been a while. Honey, get up there. Now look what a coincidence, Huldson. A pretty little thing just arrived, that you'll really like. Tell us, how did you end up in this joint? 'Cause you sure don't look like a call girl. If you tell me you're a virgin, I'll believe you. Ms. Larissa said she is coming up. Client or complaint? It's that nice guy that hasn't shown up in a while. Nice guy... Girls. These stairs will kill me. You, client. Hurry up, honey. I don't have all day. Girls, fix yourselves up, you're looking tired. Come, sweetie, get down there. Hi. Hi. I'm Huldson. Hi, Huldson. What's your name? Bruna. What? Bruna. How old are you, Bruna? I'm 18 years old. It's your first trick, isn't it? It is, here. Calm down. Relax. Come here, sit down. Stand up. Stand up. Lay down. I didn't cry. I didn't ask to stop. I didn't run back to my parents' house. At that moment, Raquel, the Raquel I once was, was dead. Can I leave this here to wash? Leave it with the others. Oh, My God! Barbie, when you open the tap, the shower goes cold. Go wash your undies somewhere else. Hurry up in there, Janine. Want a fix, cutie? Let's get dressed, we got clients. Just like any other job, the secret was knowing how to sell yourself. I'm Mel, I suck real good. Hi, Mel. I'm Janine, how you doing? Better now. Hi, I'm Bruna and I'll do whatever you want. At first, I didn't know how to be sexy, how to be desired. I never imagined someone would pay to be with me. On the first week, I had about 30 guys. That's more than most women fuck in their entire lives. Earn 5000 Reais a month giving massage. This is what the ad said. It sounded like the easiest job in the world, but it wasn't. But what I made working there was more than the double of my brother's income. It was more than those preppy school girls would earn with a diploma. Girls, introductions in room 3. Mel and Janine, go. Bruna, you can rest. Come on, girls. Larissa, if you want, I can go again. If I keep this up, how much can I earn in a month? Sweetie, a lot more than a saleswoman behind the counter. Now, please buy yourself some sexiest outfits. Those rags you wear... I like this one. Those are granny panties. There are some great blouses over here. Let me see. It looks great. I don't know... We beat you 3 to 0, bro. Jerk. That's Bruna. Fuck, man, she's hot. For real! Hi, I'm Bruna. Do you want to talk? No, we can chat upstairs. I can call the other girls for your friend. No, I want you. Let's go upstairs? Ok. - Wait here. - What else can I do? The girls said that in the beginning every newcomer did well. But while they talked about me, I was making a name for myself. I have to confess, I loved being the most popular girl in school. Oh, fuck. Yeah, slowly... That feels good. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Bruna. Gustavo. - Let's go upstairs? - Yep! - Come in. - Excuse me. Please come back. I will. I will come back. When you go downstairs to pay, tell them this one is on me. - Really? - This one is on the house. I'm fed up with this shit. Barbie is hogging all the clients. Let the girl earn her money... You had your time... Are you jealous? I'm not jealous! Jealous... I have a son to raise. If I had money she could have every client. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. But there's something we don't know about her. There sure is. Hi, I'm Bruna. I'm Rodrigo. Remember? Remember me, Bruna? I'm Celeste and Mr. Otto's son... That great naive couple, who adopted that ugly little girl, believing she could be someone. And look at what she turned into... A whore. - You are a whore. - What are you doing here? I should ask you. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? You whore! My mother loves you. Their life turned into a living hell. They keep blaming each other and here you are, spreading your legs for a 100 reais! A 100 reais! - Stop it! I'm going to scream! - Are you? Is it money you want? Is it? Take it! Now stay away from my family. I'll tear you apart, so help me God. I swear I'll tear you apart! Slut. You piece of shit. Stay away. Alright? Bruna... Whore. I don't know why, but for some reason, I thought I was doing that because I loved my parents. It was never something I did to hurt them, I just wanted them to feel something for me. Longing, shame, or even anger. Hello? Hello? Hello? Raquel! Is that you, Raquel? Raquel? Hello? Hi. You are not well today. What's the matter? I'm fine! Everything's ok, Hudson. Huldson. Huldson. I'm a call girl. If things are fine with you, then I feel great. No, I don't want to have sex today. Today I want you to smoke. Go over by the window. I want to look at you. Don't look at me. Can I tell you a secret? Is it what I'm thinking? You were my very first client. Is that what you were thinking? No. I thought you were going to tell me your name. You know my name. It's Bruna. Tell me your name, come on. My name is Bruna. Pour me some coffee, hon. The next client is all yours. It's time for you to haul a man. Let's go to my office, you'll put on some perfume and go to the reception. Let's go. Grab my cigarettes. What about the diary? Have you been writing? Yeah. Want a cigarette? No, thanks. Fuck! I can't believe it! Someone stole my stuffs! Who was it? Are you nuts? - It was you, wasn't it? - What are you talking about? - Maybe you misplaced it? - Someone broke into my locker! They took my jewelry, my money, everything! Maybe you deserve it... What do you mean, you jealous bitch? Everyone knows who you really are. I don't steal from anybody. - Listen up, bitch. - Shut up! I'm gonna kick your ass, you rich bitch! - I'm not stupid. - Mind your own business! - What's going on? - Bruna's locker was broken into. Broken into? Everything I had was stolen. - I'm going to call the cops. - Are you insane? What's going on? - Janine stole my money! - I did not! Larissa, look at me. I swear on my son. I didn't steal anything. She says she didn't take it. Enough. The show's over. Scatter. - Who does she think she is? - Be quiet. What do you want me to do? Let it slide? I told you, Janine has a short fuse. She'll do anything for a client, but she's not a thief. So tell me, who else would want to screw me? Don't run away, I'm talking to you. - Say it! I want to hear you say it! - Are you crazy? Say what? - Where's my money? - Stop it! Say what? I didn't take any money, you are crazy! You're fucked if you don't tell me. Say it! Say it... I didn't take anything, I swear! - I'll have to hurt you. - I didn't take anything! - Where is my money? - I didn't take... Where is my money, bitch? Say it! I don't want to hurt you... You bitch! Listen! I'm not a preppy idiot! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me. I'm sorry. I spent it all on powder. I'm pathetic. Sorry... You'll pay me back, do you hear me? You will have to pay me back. Do you hear me? Fucking junkie! Piss off, you wanna-be slut. What are you writing? A letter to my son. What do you want with me? I want to apologize. I'm sorry for accusing you. I know it wasn't you. Listen up. I've starved, couldn't send money home, but I've never stolen anything. I'm apologizing. You girls think I'm a stupid prom queen on vacation. But for me it's hard as hell to be here too. I respect all of you. I want to be respected as well. Alright. People think call girls work at night. But the truth is we're busier during the day. I never stopped. When I closed the door, I didn't want to be just another fuck. I wanted to be the highlight of that guy's day. I didn't discriminate. Call girls don't choose. I treated everyone well, I guess that was my secret. Sometimes, knowing that a client wanted me, was worth more than the money. It was weird thinking that while they were there, their wives were at work or cooking at home. But even this issue became a subject in bed. Each of them was a trip, another story for me to tell. There was a guy who liked to show me how big he was. Biggest one you ever seen, right? Another one paid to move the furniture around. Now­ the bed goes over there! It was all he could do, poor guy. - Is it good over here? - I want to look out that way. Put the stool on that side. It will look great! But the funniest client, was Mr. Powder. Go on up, dear. He almost poisoned us with all that baby powder. Hey, Janine, Powder digs you. There were many strange guys, but for some reason, I pleased them all. Seven out of ten guys wanted Bruna. Bruna, now that you're experienced, tell us, what do men like? Every man likes something different. Men like to make women cum. If you moan just right, even if you fake it, they go crazy. If the guy realizes you're doing it for money, he's not coming back. - Right, Janine? - Moan for us. Moan so that we can hear Barbie moaning. Let's find out how you get so many clients. Moan! I want to see if you're a professional. Moan, goddamnit. Come on! It's easy. Sometimes you take a breath, like this... - Stop it. - You do it like this... Moan, girl! Could you tone it down a bit, the customers are complaining. The customers? And what are we? I'm asking with all due respect for you to keep it down. I'm not keeping it down. I'm a customer and I'll talk the way I want. I think you're losing your temper for nothing. Be honest, you don't serve prostitutes here. Madam, if you keep screaming I'll call security. I'm not a fucking madam. I'm leaving. Take your hands off me. Let's go, girls, we're leaving. - We're leaving! - Come on, Yasmin! - You got a problem? - Leave me alone! - How much do I owe you? - You don't have to pay. I'm going to pay. Listen up, ladies! Pay attention! While you complain about other people's lives, we have an appointment with your husbands, right? If you want to learn something, here's my business card! Just take it! Let's go! That's right! Go fuck yourselves! - Go fuck yourselves! - Stupid women! "The customers are complaining"! What customers? What customers? This situation... Leave it over there. My nails look terrible, it was no use! You paid for nothing! I don't know why did you waste all that money! What was I supposed to do... Shit. Here. It didn't smear that much. I was watching you on the dance floor­ You rocked, girl. What's your name? Bruna. Pleasure. I'm Carol. Listen Bruna, I'm with some friends in the VIP area... That would love to meet you. VIP area? Guys, this is Bruna. What's up, Bruna? Nice to meet you, Bruna. How are you? Good? I have never seen you here before, Bruna. First time? What do you work with, Bruna? Sex. I want to talk with my friend. We're waiting for you outside. Let's go? Wait, Bruna! Hey, Bruna! Hey! - Hey, Bruna. - Bruna, look. Give me a call, I'd love to see you again. And here! Here's something for you to remember me by. - We're leaving. - Bye, honey! You better go cause she's stressed out. Oh, fuck! Fuck! The police, shit! Goddamnit! My registration's expired, everything is fucked. Fuck! - Good evening. - Good evening. License, please. Wait, just a second. Damn it. I left it at home. Everything is in my other purse. At least give me the vehicle's registration. I left it all there, man. I'll have to seize your vehicle and your license. Let it slide, man. There are only women here. "Let it slide?" Officer, can I have a quick word with you? A quick word? What's she going to do? I can't believe it. Look! I'm shocked. I'm shocked. He fell for it. Barbie scored the cop. Our princess had a quickie. You go, girl. We're good to go. Me and my girlfriend Were holding each other tight She turns to me and says Would some wine be alright Next thing I know She has lost her mind Now everyone is lookin' At my princess' behind She's a goner, dancin' crazy Movin' across the floor I'm standin' here like a fool Tryin' hard to ignore But she keeps gettin' down and dirty Shakin' it from bottom to top She goes up, she gets down My princess just can't stop She goes up, she gets down... Oh, God... My head. Jesus, major hangover... I think I'm still drunk. What's gotten into you? Are you deaf? I'm ringing the damn bell and no one showed up. And what about this dirty table? Kelly! Got wasted last night, huh? Whoever's not ready in five minutes is getting fined. What about Sleeping Beauty? Where is she? Jesus Christ. There are no clean sheets. There's nothing I can do. The laundry isn't back yet. You expect me to work on cum-stained sheets? Turn them over. You've slept more than worked, so it can't be that stained. Alright then. When the next client arrives, I'll fuck him on the floor. You're starting to piss me off, you little bitch. Punk. How much longer, Carol? At least another 45 minutes. - 45? - Of course! I can't do it! I have to be careful not to get ugly again. Don't get paranoid, sugar. You look great. By the way, Miguel called me. He spoke highly of you. I'm going to introduce you to some high rollers. Just like your sugar daddy, with an allowance every month? Soon you'll score a man who'll pay for your vacation, benefits... and then, life will be much easier. Don't even say it. I ran away so that I wouldn't depend on anyone. Now honestly, that friend of yours Gabi, just won't do. She's cheap. She's too ghetto. You're at another level. - I'm playing for keeps. - You're picking up all my cards. I'm playing for real. I want to win this cash. Listen up, girls. I want everyone's attention. If you want to fuck up your nose snorting, go ahead. But not in my place! I want to know whose this is. Who owns this crap? There's a bunch of girls out there looking for work. Plenty of hot, beautiful college-girls! Spill it, Kelly. Tell me everything! If you don't, you'll be the first one out on the street. Leave her out of this. I admit it. It's all mine. I don't care. It's all mine, Larissa. News flash. Both of you, pack your things and get out. Do you hear me? Now! 1, 2, 3, out! Fucking bitch. For what the building offers, the price is excellent. - Yes, it really is. - It's pricey, though. Services like parking, access to the gym and rec area are included. Everything's included. I don't think we need a place this big. A flat like this doesn't cost as much as a hellhole in the ghetto. These stairs lead to the suite. Lavatory, kitchen, terrace. Carol was my ticket to the world of VIP clients. Gabi, my partner, was with me. They were my only friends, but back then I was more concerned with money than friendship. I'm afraid we're risking too much. Gabi, some call girls earn more than doctors or lawyers. If all else fails, the worst that can happen to you is going back to be a call girl. You know that I'm looking for another gig. I wanna work in fashion and never turn tricks again. Did you manage to get my things? At least now I have clothes. You don't know! Guess what happened? Larissa is pissed. Clients keep asking for Bruna, who looks like a surfer girl. Now she understands who kept that place going. That's it, Gabi, of course. What?

ARE YOU A REAL CALL GIRL? I LOVE YOU! BRUNA I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU! Right away, I realized that the blog would set me apart. I didn't make up anything, that was my life. And everyone was curious about a call girl's life. BRUNA SURFER GIRL'S DIARY YESTERDAY WAS A BUSY DAY, A LOT HAPPENED­ THE 1ST ONE ALMOST DIDN'T GET THERE, BUT I WARMED HIM UP. I realized that besides fooling around guys loved to talk about their problems. And I liked to listen. - Where do you work? - In a bank. A bank! What do you do? - I'm an business man. - Everyday, same time? Do you want to see? That's my daughter, when she was little. My darling. She's so cute! She is so smart! - You're so proud, aren't you? - She's going places. To this day I don't know what my profession is. I took a public service exam. I start at 8 a.m., leave at 6 p.m. No one talks to each other. I stare at the computer, welcome people. I was the perfect woman. I was there to fuck, listen and never complain. And so... My wife doesn't help either. She only worries about the dogs. Cocker Spaniel this, Poodle that. YOUR BLOG IS VERY NICE. I WANT TO SEE YOUR FLAT. YOU'RE AWESOME! VERY HOT! I CAN'T WAIT TO FUCK YOU AGAIN! IS YOUR FLAT IN MOEMA? SO HOT! LET'S GO TO A SWING CLUB ON FRIDAY? Whoever had Bruna Surfer Girl always wanted more. What I didn't expect was to become the most famous call girl in Brazil. Not bad for someone who had low self-esteem. You're really hot. I'm not the same Bruna you met at the club. Now I'm a different Bruna... Bruna Surfer Girl. It's the money. So, Bruna, if you had to give me a score, what score would it be? What do you mean a score? A score from 0 to 10? It doesn't need to be a standard score. It could be some kind of rating: Good, hot, excellent, sensational, incredible, loser, limp dick. Let me think... Excellent! NEWS FLASH! FROM NOW ON SURFER GIRL WILL RATE HER CLIENTS 3RD ROUND: BUSINESS MAN, SOPHISTICATED, 40 YEARS OLD. TOOK A WHILE TO WARM UP... BUT THEN HE NAILED ME. RATING: The ranking idea made the blog even more popular. I'd do 25 to 30 dates a week, an average of 5, 6 dates a day. Which meant a lot of money. In cash. I thought you weren't coming. 4TH ROUND: SINGLE MAN. KINKY BALD GUY. HE WAS VERY HORNY. HE TOOK FOREVER TO CUM. NICE TIP. It took me 6 months to get enough money to bang you. 6 months? 2ND ROUND: MARRIED MAN. VERY KIND. VERY GENTLE. HE CAME 3 TIMES! RATING: I never thought that job was wrong or dirty. Men don't consider being with a call girl, cheating, and they go home much more excited. NEW COMMENTS NEW COMMENTS NEW COMMENTS NEW COMMENTS - Want a cigarette? - No, thanks.

Bruna Surfer Girl. It's your boyfriend. Hi, handsome. I read your blog. I saw what you posted about your fabulous clients. They think the world of you. I'm pissed off. I can't believe you'd be jealous, Huldson. I want compensation for all this debauchery. You and me. Dinner. At a restaurant. There's a place I want to take you. - I charge for outcalls. - You can charge me. Outcalls are twice the price. Think about it. Your professionalism and the vulgarity of your blog... You can't imagine how horny that makes me. Follow me, please. Make yourselves comfortable and have a nice dinner. - Thank you. - Excuse me. So, do you like it? This place is amazing. And to think that a client had never asked me to dinner. That's because you don't accept the good things. Yet you keep finding me special? Listen, Bruna, or whatever your name is. I know that somewhere inside you lives an amazing person that you killed off for some reason. And I want to find out why. I brought you something. Stop playing a role. I don't deserve this. It's yours. Hi, Gabi. I'm on a date, tell them to wait. Thanks. It's gorgeous. But I prefer my double pay. Fine, Bruna! Very good. Now...

Get up. - Get up! - I'm sleeping, god damnit. Let's go, let's go. I had a dinner yesterday, a bachelor party with 8 guys­ It's our fourth cancellation this week! Soon we won't have any clients left. Who gets fucked to support this shit? Want to trade? Now she is rating the guys. - Look at this picture. - She looks gorgeous. - Are you going to write to her? - Yes, hold on. I started blogging about my clients, but after awhile I became the main subject. - Bruna, I want to interview you. - You are so hot! - How much for the whole night? - Write some tips on your blog. Bruna, I'm a virgin... - Bruna, do you do DP? - Bruna, have you ever done a ménage? - Show me your boobs. - I'm horny! - I love you, marry me! - I want to go to your party. Do you really surf? My webpage had more than 10 thousand views a day. I became a hit on the web. And I finally understood why people want to become celebrities. It's not for the fame, but to be loved. Great. Everything is perfect. There's only one Bruna Surfer Girl. She's lucky, honey. You're jealous. You gotta pay to have a piece of this. Don't forget to thank them. Thanking is classy. Ok? I'm starting to get anxious. Our company is called Kelly & Mel, get it? Girls, you look gorgeous! So hot! Great! How is Bruna doing? She is great. Very excited, a lot of positive energy. Shouldn't she make a more discreet entrance, greet people­ No way, sugar. You're narrow minded... We still have a surprise at the end. I'll handle it. Goddess! You are so hot! - Take your clothes off! - Go Bruna! Bruna, I love you. Good evening. What a beautiful, sexy, and horny crowd. I'm very happy to be here, at this party that my friend Carol threw for me. Gorgeous! It's a dream I was able to accomplish, because I never stopped believing in what I wanted. That's why you have to fight for what you believe in, you know? You can be someone as well. That's it. That's always it. Now I'm going to call a friend of mine, my friend Carol, who put this party together. We have a little surprise for you. Come here. Happy birthday, girl. I have one thing to say. Here at my best friend's birthday, you're the ones who get the presents! Bruna Surfer Girl is yours tonight for free. Listen, everyone. Calm down! Calm down, people! Get in line, please. You! You too? Do you have a number? You too, right? Quit it, Gabi. Ghetto insecurity. Wake up, don't you get it? I'm Bruna. Bruna Surfer Girl. You can go to any table, talk to any guy. Everyone wants to fuck me. Go on. Do you doubt me? Choose one, go ahead! Choose! Would you cut the bullshit, please? You're spending too much, snorting like crazy. If you want to keep this up, I'd rather you to call your girlfriend, whose only concern is her own line of coke. Carol, your problem is Carol. What is it? Are you jealous of Carol? Or maybe you envy her? Envy? Envious of a bloodsucker who depends on a geezer? I prefer to open my legs for 20 bucks. So that's it. Carol does her job, you do yours and stop bothering me. Now, If you don't want it anymore, you can quit, it won't matter to me. That's what I'll do. I'm leaving. Ok? This way, both of you can fuck up the rest of your life. Don't overdo it. Come on. You're the one overdoing it and you don't even realize it. By the way... Don't forget to pay these bills for that fancy party Carol threw for you. Your time is up. Did you hear me? Your time is up! Let go of me! Let go of me! Your time is up! You only have one hour! - Are you fucking crazy? - What? Don't worry I'll say good things about you on my blog. I thought you were a pro, Surfer Girl... Here's your money. You're fucking terrible at this. Bruna? Bruna. Hey, I need a break, alright? I'm going to drink some water and then we'll start. Today I'm talking to Bruna Surfer Girl. Bruna, how did it feel to be awarded for the Interactive Revelation of the year? Did you imagine that your blog was this popular? I don't know if this much. Did success change your routine? What are you going to do after this interview? I'll wait for my clients as I always do. I want to thank everyone who nailed me. My fee is the same and I haven't stopped because I'm famous. If you want to fuck me, What else? Bruna. Come in. Excuse me. I scheduled with Gabi. Gabi doesn't work here anymore. I booked a time with her. I looked for you everywhere, babe. I went to where you worked, but they didn't know about you. There are a few new girls over there, nothing interesting. Haven't you heard about the internet? Blog, Bruna Surfer Girl's blog? Nice place. You have a pool, you can sunbathe. So? So? Are we fucking or do you intend to keep up this little chat? 300 reais. This is entertainment. I don't work with charity. I see. Sorry, my bad, I think I got it all wrong­ This isn't what I expected... TODAY I TOOK THE DAY OFF. AFTER ALL, SURFER GIRL NEEDS TO REST. COME BY TOMORROW. SHOW UP, I'M WAITING FOR YOU. NEW COMMENTS LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU CUT THE PRICE. I'LL BRING SOME FRIENDS! Cut me a line. - Sorry? - Cut me a line. Didn't you sleep last night? - Half and half, right? - This is mine. This doesn't even cover half of what you owe me. So take more then half. Leave some for me. Take care. Bye, call me. - I'm going to take these. - Just a second, please. - We have it. - Hey! I'm going to grab some beer inside, right? - Where is the beer? Thanks. - There! What is your code? All right. - I'll pay for these with the gas. - Ok. Right, good night. I'm taking these. Carol. Carol, open the door. I know you're in there. Carol, open! Open this fucking door. I swear I'll pay you. MY DAD! NO LIFE... - Lady, which number is up? - Number 22. They told me this girl is hot... Line up, boys. It's gonna be a long day. Come on. Next! Next! Next! Someone help me, she passed out! Someone help! Emergency room 2. You'll be fine. What are you doing here? I brought you some clothes. What happened? I'm tired. I'm spending New Year's at the beach. Do you want to come? I really want you to change your life. I want to be with you. I've got everything. You don't have to worry. You can go back to your studies, graduate high school, study psychology­ - Stop the car. - What? Please, stop the car. You are very sweet, you know that? I just wish you could understand me. I left my parent's house, so I wouldn't depend on anyone. So I could have my own life. Raquel. My name... My name is Raquel. Sometimes I miss my old life. My dad and my mom... I even miss my house. But I think I miss the family I wanted to have, more than the family that I actually I had. I'm proud of myself. I met all kinds of people. I allowed myself to be another person. I also made bad choices. But if it wasn't this way, I'd never learn to love myself for who I am. That's why I'm telling this story, so I'll never forget it. It was as a call girl that I truly found myself. I learned a lot of things. Maybe if I never left my parents' house, my relationship with them would have gone back to normal. Bruna wouldn't have existed, only Raquel. Only Bruna could reach this conclusion, not Raquel. I'll stop turning tricks. I want to marry and have children like everybody else. Before I do that, I need to save enough money to live comfortably. I'll work for another 6 months, it'll be about 700, 800 dates. When I leave this life, I want to leave it the same way I started, accepting that it was my choice. Come in. AFTER 6 MONTHS, RAQUEL STOPPED TURNING TRICKS. SHE WROTE THE BOOK "THE SCORPION'S SWEET VENOM", THAT SOLD MORE THAN 250 THOUSAND COPIES IN BRAZIL AND WAS TRANSLATED INTO 15 LANGUAGES. TODAY RAQUEL LIVES WITH AN EX-CLIENT. SHE NEVER TALKED TO HER PARENTS AGAIN. Recovered by (c) dCd / March 2019
