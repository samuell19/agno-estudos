(BREATHING DEEPLY) (BREATHING DEEPLY) - Oh. - Ah! (BOTH LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) Hey! (EXCLAIMS) (MOANS PLAYFULLY) (LAUGHING) (DOG BARKING) (INAUDIBLE) CLARICE: Shall we have lunch? I've had enough of the beach for today. Filipa, go and get your brother and sister. CLARICE: Don't be difficult, if you don't eat up, there'll be no dessert. Pass Antonio's plate, please. Here. Antonio, come to the table! I'll get the juice. Come on, eat up, you heard your mother. That's right. - Thanks! - It's horrible. But it's good for you. FERNANDA: I'm telling Mom! (SHUSHING) May I have some more? Mmm! (CLARICE THANKING IN FRENCH) You might at least wash your plate once in a while. I never wash my plate, why this all of a sudden? A pile of dirty plates might do you some good. - It's all yours. - Oh, really? (WHISTLES) Kids, whoever washes the dishes gets an ice cream! - I'll do it. - No, let me! Easy now, careful. LUIZ: And your book, Mathias, how's it going? It's going fine. (CLARICE LAUGHING) Liar! You haven't written anything all week! Seriously! Intimacy sure stinks. No, it's going fine, thank you. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (IN PORTUGUESE) No, don't be unfair. You know how much I want you to succeed. Thanks, I'd never have guessed. I just don't identify with the characters he creates. What characters? Can you tell us? I'm curious. Those existential types who never do anything. They just go around tormented by their own desires. Your sarcasm was always one of the most charming things about you, my dear. Thank you, my love. - You're so sweet. - You're welcome. Excuse me. Filipa, get Mummy a whiskey? This one's all watery. ELVIRA: Clarice, drink one then have another. (CLARICE LAUGHING) No, but... A whiskey, please. - For you? - No, for my mom. - Is she here? - Yes. - Fine. Straight? - With ice. She likes it with ice. Plenty of sugar? Thanks. Is that good? - GIRL: Truth or dare, Isabela? - Truth. Are you a virgin? Yes! - (ALL EXCLAIMING) - I am! Go on, turn it again. Right, Juliana asks Arthur. Who's the prettiest girl in this circle? Go on! Answer! - Well? - Go on, Arthur! Answer! Answer, go on. Filipa! (ALL EXCLAIMING DRAMATICALLY) Go on, aren't you going to give him a kiss? Shut up! You're so full of yourself! Filipa asks Rodrigo. Who's the best-looking guy in the circle? (ALL LAUGHING) I'm not saying! Answer, Rodrigo, why not? What a dumb question, Filipa! Then you'll have to pay the forfeit. I want you and Arthur to kiss on the mouth. Right here in the middle. Go on! ALL CHANTING: Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss! (GIRL HOOTING) Wow, just look! They're so serious! - Go on! - (GIRLS SHRIEKING) How lovely! - (GIRLS CHATTERING) - So cute! Very good! - Cool! - See their faces! It was worth it. This came for you. Thanks. It's from my agent. What does he want? Paulao Portela wants to buy the TV rights to my last book. Cool, huh? Is it a good offer? In what sense? In the money sense. That's not what matters. What do you mean? You know we need money. I can't talk to you. (SIGHING) Yes, you can't talk to me because your concerns are all artistic, and mine are all practical, such as the bills from the bank. Paulao is a useless producer, I'm not going to sell. That's the deal. There's stuff you don't understand. Ever! Hey! - Nice here, isn't it? - Yeah! - You been here before? - Yeah. Who with? My friends. It's funny how the waves make a triangle because of the pointed rocks. It's so lovely, this landscape. Have you seen the turtles over there? No, where? You really can't see? There are two enormous! I can't see a thing! Down there, right under us. I can't see anyth... I don't know... I'd keep the beach house and you the apartment in Sao Paulo. Why? I like it here much more than you do. But you're too lazy to take care of a beach house. It's weird. Any topic is always a pretext for you to attack me. I'm sorry. I don't even know how we got onto that. Exactly. We're not going to split up, are we? It's up to you. Is it up to me or you, Clarice? Both of us, Mathias. Well, let's see. Let's see. Another? Hi. Hi. FILIPA: All right? MATHIAS: Sure. To us. (CLICKS TONGUE) (SIGHING) (ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC PLAYING) MATHIAS: Do you want a brother? I'll rent you one. FILIPA: No, I want one! MATHIAS: You've already got one. A really nice one! A little brother, one I can hold on my knee. MATHIAS: I'll buy you one. FILIPA: No. I want a real one. (EXCLAIMING) Here's my king! Sorry. Shall we sing "Happy Birthday"? Come on! Okay, folks, please! Let's sing "Happy Birthday" for the coolest kid here! (ALL CHEERING) Go on! Filipa! Filipa, I need to talk to you. Not now. No, seriously, I need to talk to you. I told you I don't want to. It's quick. I've something to tell you. But I don't want to. What happened with that boy? - I don't like him. - So what, Filipa? That doesn't give you the right to treat him badly, you must treat people nicely. You don't treat my dad nicely. Don't you speak to me like that. - I'll do what I like. - No, you won't. And if you talk to me like that, you're grounded, okay? (SIGHING) ('60S GIRL GROUP SONG PLAYING) Remember that? I love that song. - Come on, Clarice, please. - No. Come on. Here. She dances so well. What's up? What? Nothing. Nothing. MATHIAS: Good morning! CLARICE: Good morning! MATHIAS: Good morning! - Morning. - Morning, Dad. Can I have the coffee, please? CLARICE: Fernanda, want a banana? FERNANDA: No. - CLARICE: You sure? - Okay, I'll have one. CLARICE: Eat up, Antonio. Just a little bit. MATHIAS: What's wrong? Are you all right? I'm not hungry. Really? Come here, come on. I'm going to the beach. The beach? Now? Filipa seems upset with you. Did you two argue? No. Did you fight with your sister? I don't fight with her, she's the one who fights with me. Liar. - You never fight, you're an angel. - Thanks, Dad. You wanted to talk to me? I did that day. Not anymore? I'll be over there. Go on, then. I... I want to go out with you. - Ju, how about a swim? - Come on. Mom, can I take a picture? You a photographer now, too? I thought it was just your sister. Do I look pretty? I took a picture of Mom for you. Thanks. Why? Because she's pretty. Yes, she's pretty. You're much prettier than she is. Smile. Get out, you monster! - I saw what you did at the beach. - What did you see? You know, you slut. Are you asking for a beating? If you don't make my bed for a month, I'll tell everyone. - You'll see. - Come back here, I'm serious! Antonio kissed a girl at the beach. Liar, she was kissing a boy. He won't admit it because she is chubby. - (ALL LAUGHING) - Shut your mouth, you liar. All right, Son. Do we know her, has she ever been here? - Come here! Is she chubby? - She's lying! All right, Son. Let's change the subject. - Oh, I've news for you. - What? Dad's book is going to be made into a TV movie. - Now, take it easy. - When will it be on? MATHIAS: Clarice. It's not quite like that. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Maybe. It's not certain yet. What are the chances? - Ask your father. - Huh, Dad? Your mother talks too much. (THANKING IN FRENCH) Thanks. (THANKING IN FRENCH) MATHIAS: Okay. FERNANDA: It'd be great if it happened. (ALL EXCLAIMING) Come here, Antonio. Let me go, Filipa! Let me go! I'll tell Mom everything. Come here. - Let me go, Filipa! - Come here! Mom, Antonio was fighting at the beach. What's this, Antonio? He started it, Mom. That's terrible, fighting like some street kid, sit down. Are you hurt? FILIPA: Where's Dad? - Your dad went out. - Where to? I don't know, my love. Let me see. It's all red, Antonio. (WATER RUNNING) (MATHIAS HUMMING SOFTLY) You scared me! What are you doing there on the floor? Like a little monkey. Hey! Filipa! - Thanks, bye. - Bye. Shit, I forgot to buy your mother's shampoo. That's okay, we bought whiskey. What? You can't talk about your mother like that. She's always getting smashed. - But you can't judge her. - Yes, I can. No, you can't. Now please, go fetch the shampoo. Go on! What happened? Nothing. LUIZ: She was sunbathing by the pool, he comes up, they fight, he pulls out a gun and shoots her twice in the face. Must have been a crime of passion. CLARICE: I bet it was some loser. Probably felt threatened by her. I don't know, he sounds more like some macho son of a bitch. LUIZ: A Sao Paulo businessman left his wife and daughter for his mistress. I know murder is never right, but I can understand his reasons. - Oh, no, Mathias. - Wait. Jealousy is a dark sentiment. When it takes hold. A guy like that should be locked up till he dies. Murderer. A murderer's a murderer. LUIZ: Maybe she had a lover. Three, four. CLARICE: If everyone with a lover got murdered, the human race would have died out. Not here! LUIZ: But I don't know, jealousy sucks. ELVIRA: Yeah? Why, aren't you jealous of me? Of course, my love, you want me to kill you, too? (ALL CHUCKLING) ISABELA: She was pretty. JULIANA: I saw her on the beach. FILIPA: Really? It says that the marble was covered in blood. - Where? - Here. BOY: I know where this house is. ISABELA: What else? She had a lover. My mother has a lover, too. (GRUNTS) (ALL MURMURING) (BOYS MOANING HAUNTINGLY) (SCREAMING) (DOG BARKING) (GIRLS SCREAMING) ISABELA: I saw her arriving in a guy's car one day. FILIPA: Aren't you going to tell your father? ISABELA: No, I don't want them to split up. - My dad has a lover, too. - Really? That American woman who lives here at the beach. I'm going to tell my mom everything. You want them to split up? What will you do there? - CLARICE: I told you. I'm going to work. - Yes. Have you forgotten why we came to this beach? Of course not. Good. You know what you're doing. (CLARICE SIGHING) I'm taking Antonio with me. No need. The boy's fine here with me. No, he's not. He got into a fight today. - Did he win or lose? - What difference does it make? Plenty. I don't know whether to congratulate him or ground him. You son's becoming a macho just like you. I'm pretty liberal for a macho, don't you think? I know how far your liberalness goes. (BOTH ARGUING IN FRENCH) (IN PORTUGUESE) I don't believe this work talk. (DISMISSING IN FRENCH) - Bye, kids. - Bye, Mom. You behave! - Bye, honey. - Bye, Mom. Mom. You shouldn't go. I'll be right back. Are you all right? (AGREEING) (INDISTINCT) (WHOOPING) (ENGINE STALLING) Holy shit. I forgot to get gas. What are we going to do? Nothing. Wait. Someone will come along soon. With any luck. (BOAT APPROACHING) (BOAT HONKING) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) FILIPA: Look what I found down on the beach. How lovely! So mademoiselle. You haven't given me a kiss yet today. - Don't feel like it. - Don't be silly! - Come on, give your dad a kiss. - No. - Where are you going? - Let me go! (EXCLAIMING) (BOTH LAUGHING) FILIPA: Have you slept with anyone? ARTHUR: Yeah. FILIPA: Who with? ARTHUR: Some girl. FILIPA: Liar. I bet you've never even seen anyone having sex. - Have you seen anyone? - Yeah. Let's go. - CLARICE: I'm sick of the whole thing. - (MATHIAS ARGUING IN FRENCH) CLARICE: Sick of all the rudeness. I'm not arguing with you anymore! Just stop it! - CLARICE: Happy now? - (CLATTERING) MATHIAS: Go to him! CLARICE: Careful what you say. Careful what you wish for, because you might get it! MATHIAS: What'll you do? Tell me! (ARGUING CONTINUES) (SIGHING) - MATHIAS: One. - She's going to win. MATHIAS: Two. LUIZ: It's falling. MATHIAS: Three. ELVIRA: She's better than you. Four. Five. ELVIRA: You blow the spoon first, isn't that the trick? (ALL LAUGHING) (LUIZ INQUIRING IN FRENCH) (MATHIAS REPLYING IN PORTUGUESE) Oh, my book. My book is about a separation. (CLARICE SCOFFING) How appropriate. Clarice, please. Sorry. I was joking. Can't I make a joke? LUIZ: Well, so anyway. MATHIAS: It's about a couple. Otavio and Isadora. One day Isadora meets a guy 10 years her junior. They start having an affair. To start with it's all very discreet. Isadora doesn't think it's of any importance. But she's married, right? What about the husband? MATHIAS: The husband finds out, of course. The betrayed one always finds out, right? LUIZ: So then what, they split up? She wants to, but he doesn't. - ELVIRA: He doesn't? - Uh-huh. ELVIRA: Shouldn't it be the other way around? You need to understand. In a love triangle, the external element pushes them to a point they could have never imagined. LUIZ: Interesting, isn't it? ELVIRA: Yes. The book is about a separation. But it's a slow separation. It's about things breaking, things one can never recover. I think my book is about trust. About the limits one can reach. Understand? - Oh, too dull! - Understand? Thank you, my dear. Shall we go to the beach? - Yes, the beach! - ELVIRA AND LUIZ: Beach! So anyway, it's a comedy! (SHATTERING) (CLARICE CRYING) I can't stand it anymore. I can't stand it. I don't know what to do! ELVIRA: Clarice, take it easy. I'll go talk to Filipa. What's wrong, Mom? Why are you crying? Because of Dad? No, that's not it, honey. Go and have a proper shower. Oh, please! Mind you, you've been such a bore lately. One thing has nothing to do with the other. Yes, it does. Why would I take a bore to a really cool party? Tell me that. I promise I won't be a bore. - Oh, really? - Uh-huh. No. Oh, please. Stop being such a bore. - Please! - No, no. - I so want to go. Please! - No, and that's final. I'll do anything you want. I'll give you a massage, I'll... What else can I do? - Please, come on, let me! - You little hoodlum! - Cool! - Wait! We're friends again now, right? What? (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) They are all crazy at this party! Hi, there! What's wrong? Aren't you enjoying the party? Yes, I am. You're so quiet. Did you come alone? No. With my parents. You came to the party with your parents? - How old are you? - Fourteen. I see, that explains it. Fourteen, a kid. What's your name? Filipa. Filipa. Well, Filipa, I'm Lucas. - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - No problem. - I tripped. - No problem. Let's dry this? - FILIPA: Has it left a stain? - I don't think so. I'm sorry. It was nothing. What's your name? Filipa. My pleasure. My name is Angela. Are you Mathias's daughter? Mmm-hmm. I really like your father. I've read all his books. Don't you wear makeup? Here, have a little. (BOTH LAUGHING) Who's this mosquito waking me this morning? - Stop, Dad! - I'll wake Mom! Who? Who is it? What is it, Mom? Nothing, honey. Mommy's got a headache. Let Mommy sleep a little. Go and play. I'll make your breakfast in a minute. Okay. Thirty-four seconds. Fifty seconds. One minute fifty! I won. How long did you manage? Stop bugging me! (ANTONIO MIMICKING GUNSHOTS) I'm tired of playing this. (DOOR CREAKING OPEN) Arthur! Arthur! - What are you doing here? - Can you keep a secret? - Sure. Why? - Get your bike and follow me. Bike? Yes, come on. Is that your dad? (SHUSHING) Enough. Let's go. Are we meeting tomorrow? No. No? I don't want to go out with you anymore. Why did you take me to see that? I don't know. Are you going to tell anyone? No. So promise. I promise. If you tell anyone, my dad will shoot you. Mom? Filipa! Get out, Antonio. Go on, get out! Mom. Wake up. Get up, Mom. Mom, get up. Get up, Mom. Mom, you have to get up. Just a moment, honey, wait. Careful. (SNIFFLING) Mommy's all right. She's asleep. I love you, honey. Okay? Very much. All three of you. Sometimes Mommy does everything wrong. I don't like it when you drink. I don't want you to suffer. Okay? Forgive me. All right? I'll stop drinking. Promise? I promise. Listen, Filipa. - I want to tell you something. - What? You would find out anyway. I think it's better I tell you. So tell me. It's about Juliana. She's had sex for the first time. It was with Arthur. Are you angry with her? No. I don't like him. CLARICE: I'll go back to Sao Paulo and you stay to finish the book. And then? Then we'll see how to reorganize our lives. You're being so definitive. You always accuse me of the opposite. Yeah. But this time it's different. Different in what way? I don't want to talk about that again. I can't stand discussing that either. See? And the children? The children have noticed what's going on. I think we owe them an explanation. I don't understand you, Mathias. You yourself talked about separation so many times, when I take the decision you change your mind. I don't believe in this separation. - Believe it! - You're being flippant again! You can't talk to me like that! I'm sorry, but yes I do. You know what? You've lost your fair-mindedness. Sure, I've lost my patience, lost interest! I've lost everything, all right? I don't want to spend another night sleeping beside you. I don't want to spend another night married to you. You'll also be happier when you're free of me. I hate you. You used to say you loved me. It's been a long time. MATHIAS: There's something we want to tell you. But you mustn't be worried, okay? CLARICE: Nothing is going to change for you, okay? But your mother and I are going to live in different places. FILIPA: Are you splitting up? No. Just for a while, Filipa. MATHIAS: It'll be better for everyone. - I don't think so. Stop! - Filipa! Let her go. You can talk to her later. Come here, Fernanda. What's up? How are you? What sort of face is that? Where are you going? The beach. I'm going for a boat ride. Want to come? Hop on. Come on, no sweat. It's quite safe. Hold on tight. Filipa. Filipa, look at me. Here, turn this way. Ever since that party I've wanted to go out with you. Look at me. - Kiss me. - No. - Give me a kiss. - I don't want to. Get off. What's wrong, Filipa? - Give me a kiss! - No. Are you a virgin? Let go! Filipa, come here. Come here! Filipa! Filipa! Filipa, I want to talk to you. But I don't. Filipa, you're the oldest. You must understand and help your brother and sister. I don't have to understand anything. Why are you doing this now? I know why you want to leave my mother. - You don't know a thing. - Yes, I do! (SIGHING) You're behaving like a child. You don't know what you say. I told you I do. I'm never going to believe you. If you don't stop this nonsense, I'm grounding you. Go ahead. - To your bedroom. Now - I'm not going. If you want to act like a child, you'll be treated like a child. To your bedroom, now! Go, go, go! Please! - I never want to speak to you. - Fine. Bye. (GROWLING) (CLARICE ECHOING IN FRENCH) (MATHIAS ECHOING) I don't believe this work talk. (CLARICE SHOUTING) Screw you! (GLASS SHATTERING) Fernanda, take a picture of us. I don't feel like it. Then I'll take one. Come on, guys, not even a smile? (CAMERA CLICKING) Hi, Filipa. How are you? (TEENAGERS LAUGHING) (ALL CLAMORING) Arthur? I'd like to talk to you. Go ahead. I know you and Ju are together. You said you didn't like me. But I did. I'm sorry. ANTONIO: Mom, I don't want to leave. The holidays are almost over, Antonio. We were going to have to go anyway. But I don't want them to end. I don't want to leave. But things come to an end. Sometimes we have to do things we don't want. Hi, honey. Everything all right? I've something to tell you. What, right away? If you leave Mommy, you'll regret it. Filipa, your mother and I have come to this decision together. - Liar. I know all about it. - What? About what she doesn't know. - I don't think you know anything. - I do. Well, let's see. Go on then, tell me. I know you have a lover. I saw her photos in your drawer. I followed you to her house. I saw you together lots of times. I can't believe you did that. I went to her house today. She was with another guy. She's making a fool of you. She doesn't like you! Please, Dad, you can't leave Mommy for her. - Calm down! - Please, I won't let you. Calm down! We are separating for another reason, not Angela. Liar! I swear. - Listen, Filipa... - She's a whore! Look... Angela has nothing to do with this. You defend her after what I've told you? You're a child and can't understand these things. I'm not a child and I'll never understand. Filipa! Filipa! Shit! Are you all right, honey? You know why Dad wants to leave you? He's got a lover. What are you talking about, Filipa? It's true, I saw them. That's not it. I don't know who this woman is, what's going on, but that's not the reason. How come? Your father has had other affairs, Filipa. It's not the first time. We didn't come to the beach just because your father had to write a book. I'm not sure you should know all this, you're such a child. I'm not a child. Remember the story of the book your father's writing, which he told at the table the other day? I remember. That woman is me, Filipa. I've fallen in love with another man. A guy who's 10 years younger. A student of mine who came to fetch me at home the other day. We tried to get over it, Filipa. But it didn't work. Everything'll be all right, honey. Don't cry. Everything'll be all right. All you do is lie to one another. All you do is lie. - Hi. - Hi. Give me a whiskey. The bar's just closed. Come on, give me a whiskey. Are you old enough? I'm old enough for plenty of things. Yes, but I can't sell you a whiskey. Yes, you can. No, I can't. Please. Go on. No one needs to know? No one needs to know. - No one? - Mmm-hmm. All right then. - Like it? - Yes. Isn't Filipa with you? Why, isn't she here? No, she's not. We had a tough conversation. She told me you're having an affair here at the beach. And I told her plenty of things. What did you tell her, huh? Nearly everything. And these suitcases? What's going on? Are you going to meet him? No, Mathias. I'm going to live with him. You've got to be kidding. You think you're going to take my children to live with your lover? You think I'll let you? You don't understand. I'm going alone. The children will stay with you. That's ridiculous! Going off to live with that boy? I can't go on. Will you let me go? You're a mother! Clarice... You're leaving your children for Christ's sake. No. No. I'm leaving you. Clarice! Clarice, please. Let's talk. Let me go, Mathias. Please, let me leave. I can't stand it anymore. - I'm not like this. - I know. I'm not this drunkard. - You know I'm not. - But I'll change, too. Please stay. No. Let me go. Take care of the children. Take care of them. Let me go.
