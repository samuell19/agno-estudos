Lie down. Lie back, please. This will last 30 minutes. You'll have to lie still. See you soon with the results. I don't care whether I live or die. I'm not scared of death. Know what scares me? A poor quality of life, pain. That's what scares me. Being useless, helpless... Depending on others because I can't do anything myself. That idea terrifies me. So tell me, can it be cured or not? Leticia, unfortunately, when a metastatic disease spreads to other organs, it's incurable. But it can be contained. Your current hormone therapy is not producing the desired effect. Our only option is to start chemotherapy again. More pains, headaches, nausea, falling down. That's not a life, Doctor. I understand you, Leticia. The chemo three years ago was too strong. It's out of the question. We'll try other drugs. What if I refuse? The problem is three months ago you were fine and now your lung is affected. If you do nothing, the cancer will grow. It will reach the other lung, maybe even the liver, bones and brain. - The situation is critical. - Sorry, but I want to leave. Wait a moment, Leticia. Understand one thing: without the chemo, things will only get worse. I knew something wasn't right. I was expecting these results. I've lost weight and I feel very tired. I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning. The writing's on the wall. Wait a little, Mum. Wait for what? My days are numbered, I know it. We don't know that. It would take a miracle. Silvia, I give up. I've been fooling myself for four years. I throw in the towel. What hurts the most is not being able to see my grandson grow up. Antonio! Come eat. That's enough! Hi, honey. What did the doctor say? I can't talk about it. I have to use the bathroom. I hate public restrooms, especially in clinics. - You'll tell me about it? - Yes, later. - Well, kiddo? - He won't eat. I want to go out. You want to go trick or treating at this time of night? We're going home. Trick or treating time is over. If you promised him, you have to do it. With kids, you have to keep your promises. That's how it is. He refuses to eat. Then he won't eat! - What do you want? - To go trick or treating. No, it's too late. You had a Halloween party at school. I didn't get sweets. - Didn't he get sweets? - Yes, lots. Get down here. Granny is not feeling well. María José! Eat your dinner, Antonio! Where are you going, Mum? Going trick or treating like everyone else. What are you talking about? Let's get it over with. - Are you serious? - She insists on going. Otto! See you later, Marina. - Bye, Marina. - Bye, Ms Silvia. Good morning. I thought you'd left. Did you make coffee? Pour me a drop, will you? Hi, kiddo. That's fine. How are you? Did you sleep? Not a wink. Wish me luck. - Good luck. - Bye, honey. Don't be rude, kiss your mother goodbye. Obey your godfather. And don't miss the bus. Bye, Sergio. - Hello. - Hello, Sofía. - Everything OK? - Yes. They're all set for the interview. There's a problem, the Commissioner couldn't come. What? He has a meeting, he just called. But I'll stay with you. So I have to answer questions on subjects I know nothing about? Everything is ready. I'll be with you the whole time. It's the context that concerns us. The job was awarded to a contractor for 63 billion pesos. The other competitors, whose bids were all higher, warned, "This bid is artificially low, don't be fooled." I think I recognise a strategy that is used again and again. You can't maintain it was an artificially low bid because... I'm not saying it, the competitors are. Yes, the competitors. If during a call for bids one competitor accuses another you're saying we should trust those accusations? The tendering process would never end. The District Attorney and Comptroller don't agree with you. They've opened an investigation of you, the Public Works Commissioner and the Evaluation Committee. Yes, precisely. It's an investigation. An investigation does not prove wrongdoing. Nobody has been indicted. Unlike you, the DA and Comptroller aren't accusing anyone. They're just investigating to understand what happened. So us journalists shouldn't ask questions? You shouldn't jump to hasty conclusions. Our agency is responsible for public funds. That's why construction has been stopped in order to rule on the next steps. After this outpouring of goodwill, let's move onto the next segment. Thank you, Silvia Paz, Deputy Legal Director of City Public Works. Thanks so much. I told you the public sector, and your agency in particular, is corrupt, they're political puppets. It's the honest civil servants who take the rap. So I have to leave the public sector because I'll end up in prison? You could have your own law practice. Of course, follow in your footsteps. Your life is the only example. - This situation worries me. - Me too. What a mess they got you and your colleagues into. Honest people. - Know who ends up paying? - Me. Honest civil servants! You've told me a hundred times, enough! So why did you do that interview? Just to annoy you, of course. You make everything about you. Journalists distort everything. How can you smoke in your condition? Before you give other people lessons, look in the mirror. What difference does it make now? Are you two at it again? - Was it pre-approved? - Yes, we can go do the ECG. Can I leave you two? I have to get to work. We'll do fine without you. Let me put this out. Mum! Be right there. Hello. Still not dressed? No, I was up all night. We only have a half-hour. I'm having breakfast. We can't be late. Get ready. Sure. - Please. - Let me eat breakfast in peace. Eat something fast, we're already late. We'll miss the appointment. That would be nice. What? Look, Silvia, I'm not going. I was up all night. It's been on my mind for four days. My defences are very weak. This chemo will kill me. They'll inject me with a litre of poison. When my defences were better, it landed me in the hospital for three weeks, now it would... No, I won't go. Please, we're going. You thought this through. Yeah, right! It was you and Majo who made the decision. You took advantage of a moment of weakness and I agreed. When you two team up on me, it makes me crazy! So you're a child who lets others decide for you? Since when? That's right, I'm a grown-up. I decide how to live my life. I decide how long I want to live and my quality of life. What quality of life? You have lung cancer. Do you know what kind of death that is? A painful one. The faster it's over, the less I suffer. So you want to commit suicide? So that's it, huh? You want to kill yourself? I'm not killing myself, the cancer is, idiot! Refusing care is suicide. Explain that to your grandson downstairs. That his grandmother is letting herself die, that we let ourselves die when we're afraid. - Tell him. - I explain myself to nobody! Not to a four-year-old, to Majo, or to you. You explain yourself to nobody? Then stay alone with your ego. My son and I won't come watch your tantrums anymore. Stop shouting. Don't shout if you don't want him to hear us. Perfect, I'll never bring him back. - Get out! - Eat shit! Dirty brat! What's going on? Maybe if you'd been on time! What happened? Nothing. We're not going anywhere. Mum is refusing treatment. What did you say to make her refuse? Ask her. Why won't you tell me what's going on? Cheater. You're always cheating. You're not swimming enough. You have to go further. Why don't you get out? No, I want to stay with Toni. I'm gonna get you! I'm going to dry your hair. Just a little bit. Come here! She's allowed to have a good day. In the shape she's in? Be realistic, this isn't a good day. She's sick. - Lay off her a little. - You're crazy too. Nobody's crazy. Gotcha! Enough! Let's get dressed. We have to go. Come on, do it for me. - We're here, let's have fun. - I'd rather go home. Sergio! Hey bro! - You're finally here! - Do you know Silvia? - Hello, Silvia. - What's up? Are you Ramón? - Happy Birthday. - Thanks. Welcome. Silvia, my best friend, the person I love the most in the world. I want you to treat her like a queen. Life's little coincidences. We know each other. We don't know each other, we just... It's a long story. - We met once. - Through work. Shall we have a drink? It's that jerk Morales. Abel Morales, the guy from the interview. Holy shit! I knew I shouldn't have come. Don't worry. Drink this. Get your mind off it. I've come to make peace. I didn't know you were a friend of Ramón's friend. Knowing Ramón's friend means I'm not a corrupt piece of shit? You're not corrupt. There were questions on an unfinished construction project and I asked them, that's all. I admit the tone of the show was a little aggressive. But questions had to be asked and you did a great job. Does making your guests look guilty boost your ratings? No, I asked some questions. You were able to answer them and you did a great job. Thanks a lot. On top of accusing me, you're condescending about it. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Honestly, I'm very happy to see you again. And if you're the face of corruption, I give myself over to corruption. How did you get here? How did you get into my social circle? Another interview? Tonight, it will be much more personal. So, nothing? No boyfriend or girlfriend? Or several? No one? - I have a little boy. - Really? Where is he? He's not always attached to me. - He's at home. - So it's not a problem. What's his name? Antonio. I like that name. Ask for support, ask for help, have faith. Not everything is within our control. I had a Prosecutor friend... And when a young law graduate would screw up a case, if she was defending someone disadvantaged, a noble cause, she would pray to God. And she would get the Judge to see anything as evidence. A mere photocopy would become damning proof. And if it was a serious charge, she'd ask for the file to vanish and it would! Believe me. I believe you, but it's pretty weird to pray for a file to disappear. It's normal. She was always on the side of truth. God is always on the side of truth. And if the other side also prays to God and to the miracle Prosecutor, does everyone win? - Don't be sarcastic. - I don't understand. You don't? I just explained it. Whoever has justice and truth on their side wins. So truth and justice always triumph? Faith makes miracles. Pray, have faith. I have faith and I pray. I pray for you. It's the only remedy you leave us with. I told you she'd make fun of me. It's not the only one. I also practice alternative medicine. I eat seeds, dried fruits, baking soda, almonds. That'll cure you. Why not leeches? - Not that. - Enough! Can't we eat in peace for once? Impossible. - Then let's get the check. - Fine. Sir! I have to go. A teeny bit longer? Idiot. Please. - I have to go, because... - Why? - To take care of people. - People? I have a child. I don't sleep on the floor. - This really bugs me. - Not my socks. This really bugs me. It's a gross injustice! I'm still sore. - I bet. - What stamina! That's what they say. But anyway... No, it's a lie. I was kidding. You have nice teeth. How are things with Antonio's father? Does he ever take care of him? There is no Antonio's father. How so? Did he split? Is he the Holy Ghost? A man conceived Antonio, but he doesn't have the role of a father. He has no relationship with us. - You don't speak anymore? - No. Doesn't Antonio ever ask about him? Does it worry you? Why all the questions? I'm doing a market analysis to size up the competition. You have no competition for now. I know I'm unbeatable. Hey, kiddo. - How are you? - Good. Where is Sergio? At the grocery store. When did he leave? Six minutes ago. He left you all by yourself? What are you watching? Giant Ramps, Deadly Jumps. Why are you home so late? I was busy. Who were you with? A friend. Which friend? A new friend. Shall we go to bed? It's late. Catch him! Wait, let's negotiate. I'm going to escape! Kids! Do you want to break the piñata? OK, get in a circle. Enough grown-up games. It's the kids' turn. Three tries, no more. It was fun, wasn't it? Lots. You invited a guy who humiliated you in front of all Colombia. He admits he made a mistake. And you defend him, too! No, I understand him. Some people recognise their mistakes. You're the only one who never recognises her mistakes. You refuse to look at yourself. You're the one who decided to have Antonio alone. My fear for my grandson is that you stick him with a stepfather like that. Are you crazy? It wasn't a mistake. I never regretted it. Antonio wasn't a mistake. The mistake was not giving him a father. - Want to know the mistake? - You're all he's got. Making a man suffer his whole life, like you did to Dad. That's a mistake. Nobody would have treated your father half as well. Your father was no saint. He was a drunk, an aggressive man. I always did right by him. I cared for him until his dying breath. Not out of love, but to play the victim, and because you couldn't leave him. He died next to the person who hated him the most. - You killed the poor guy! - I never hated him! I stopped loving him, that's all! Your problem is you hate the whole world, because you hate me! This morning's outburst gave us a real scare. He was upset because I scolded him for fighting with Diego and he knocked the kitchen over onto a little girl. - Was she hurt? - She's fine. She wasn't hurt but it could've been much worse. So she's fine. What we're suggesting is to ask the school psychologist for help. Her guidance could help us handle the situation. We'd like to understand what's happening with your child. Clearly, there's a problem. See you soon, Ms Paz. Have a nice day. Thanks. Antonio's music class lets out in 15 minutes, if you'd like to wait. You behaved very badly. Very badly. It's unacceptable. They started it. Doesn't matter. They say I don't have a daddy. You know that's not true. Everyone has a daddy. Antonio, help me out, please. I don't like this school. You don't like it, but it's the only one we've got. Why don't you like it? The kids are mean. There are mean kids in all the schools. In all of them. Those ladies are furious. They'll expel you. Will you help me out? Look at me. This can't happen again. Really. OK. Ms Silvia, come! It's Catalina's birthday. Hello, ma'am. What an adorable little boy! - Something to drink? - Water. - Some cake? - No, thanks. OK. Happy birthday. - So, how did it go? - Hi, María Clara. It went all right. - I have to speak with you. - Are they still upstairs? The meeting just ended. The Commissioner is pissed. He couldn't reach you on the phone. I couldn't answer. He came down here furious and yelled at everyone. He's always yelling. Did you tell him where I was? I tried, but he wouldn't listen. He wants to see you right away. I'll go up now. - Can I leave you Antonio? - No problem. I'll watch him. You're going to stay with María Clara, OK? Eat that. I want your phone. You don't want to draw? I have crayons. - There's a notebook and crayons. - I'll take care of him. I'll be back. - Thanks. - No worries. Our agency oversees transportation for eight million people, and you're a professional. Your home life stays at home. I know your mother was sick, I know about your son and I empathize, but you have to handle your problems. It's not fair to question my professionalism when you know I work harder than anyone else here. You know everything I've done for this agency. I've spent 40 years building my reputation. I hold this position thanks to that reputation. If it gets damaged, the Mayor will fire us all, you included. Your reputation is on the line because I missed one meeting? We're in a tight spot, we can't afford to make any mistakes. Be here in the future. Remember that I'm asking you nicely and that I'm counting on you. I'm here to see my mother. Good morning. Name? Leticia Medina. All right. Family only. - Fine. - Those are the rules. Bye, thanks. - I'll wait. - This will take a while. I'll wait. Text me if you need anything. Mum, I'm here. I came right away. I know. How do you feel? She can't breathe. They did a blood test and an X-ray. She has pneumonia. She needs treatment. They're keeping her tonight... They're keeping her. They're going to hospitalise her? - We have to wait. - Wait for what? I just asked ten minutes ago. She's at the top of the list, but nothing's happened yet. I'll see what I can do. I'll be back. Hello. That's my mother in the hall. - Name? - Leticia Medina. Go ahead. She's in the middle of the hall and nobody has told us anything. We're waiting for a free bed. We'll transfer her as soon as possible. - Will it be long? - I don't know... Unfortunately the tumour is growing faster than expected. It's in a very delicate spot: it's growing next to the two major bronchial tubes. That's why the bronchi are closing up and that has two serious consequences. First, she can't breathe. Second, air impurities remain in her lungs causing infections which can turn into pneumonia. She needs antibiotics, oxygen and respiratory therapy. Once the pneumonia gets better, chemotherapy is an absolute must. It's the only solution. I have to hang up, Mum. I have a meeting. I have to hang up. Bye. Feeling better? What time is it? 4:50. A little after. - I slept an hour? - Less. 45 minutes. Did it help? Make some room for me. I was required to award the contract to the lowest bidder. The lowest bidder was this contractor, Carrera 13. The issue of the bid amount came up. I made sure it was cleared with the Evaluation Committee, which is a technical board I'm not on. This technical board is made up of engineers from our agency. An advance of 14.8 billion pesos was paid for a project that's been suspended and that's very worrisome. Look, this is a voluntary interview, which is allowed by law. This morning we submitted this testimony in writing with an explanation of the facts. I propose we end the deposition here. Because we've already presented our arguments. - Hello, Jenny. - Hello. Is Mr Romero in? He doesn't want to be disturbed. He's busy. It's urgent. Will you tell him I'm here? One moment, please. Sir, Ms Silvia is here. I've been telling you to terminate this contract for weeks. Either that or I'll have to resign. I'm not going to give those guys another 20 billion pesos. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. We didn't do anything wrong. Well, I'm afraid. There's good reason to be. Do you realise the risks? I was just at the Comptroller's Office. I know what's going on. We have to give the decision careful thought. It's a technical issue. We'll analyse it. I'll personally see to it. I'm done hearing about your technical stuff. That's what got us here. I listened to you last time and look at the mess it got me into. I'm not going down with you because you tell me to stay calm. Change your tone. I repeat, we... I make the decisions at this agency based on technical criteria and I take responsibility for it. And based on legal advice, so you should listen to me! I don't know what's happening in this office. There may be things I don't understand or that you're hiding from me. I've lost trust. - Don't disrespect me. - I'm not. It doesn't matter anymore. I'm not being treated right in this situation. Follow my advice or I'll quit. Do what you have to. You'll have my resignation letter in ten minutes. Are you OK? I don't know. I guess so. Are you sure? They can take their job and shove it. It's their shit. - You did the right thing. - I won't be their fall guy. I won't do that arsehole's dirty work. - But now I'm out in the street. - Let it all out. You're not in the street. Take your time. One step at a time. - What will happen to me? - You have savings. For a little while. - Nobody will hire me. - You can start your own business. The main thing is you got out. No, you started your own business. What am I going to start? It's for the best. You didn't want to stay there. Shall we have a drink? A little one. I had three before I got here. That's a good start. Come on, let's go. I'll be back later. Evening. Merry Christmas. We've got visitors! Look who's here! A little gift. Hi, Mum. Hey, there. Gimme five. Have you started drinking? You look a little tipsy. Mum, we have a surprise for you. Look, they brought you Christmas dinner. Look, Mum, it's delicious! Your favourite dish, you're gonna love it. It's too heavy. A little rice. That smell! All you ate for lunch was soup and crackers. Who wants some more? Pour them some wine. Here. That's nice of you, thanks. Antonio, want to toast? Leti has no appetite. Cheers, honey. Cheers, kiddo! With Granny. Gently. Perfect! To your health, Mum! - Cheers, Leti! - Merry Christmas! Silvia, thanks. No paella today. Don't worry. Antonio, what did you ask Santa Claus for? Did you write him? What did you ask for? A race car. He wrote to him on WhatsApp. He sent him a voice message. So the message won't get lost. Great idea! Perfect. What colour car? Any colour. - Need anything, Mum? - Do you need air? Are you having trouble breathing, Leti? But she has her oxygen tube. She looks tired. Should we call the nurse? - Sir. - Yes? I don't need a wheelchair. I'm not paralysed. I'd like to walk. It's clinic policy for all releases. Oh, for safety. Hello, Toni. How are you? - You came to welcome me home! - Mrs Leti! Let me take your things. Hello, Ms Silvia. Your dog was very obedient. Really? That's terrific. Are you happy to see your granny? Let me take that. Home sweet home! It's wonderful! We're happy to see you. I have dark circles under my eyes. Just look! - Did you sleep? - Not very well. I had just fallen asleep when the nurse came to wake me up to give me a sleeping pill! That's the protocol. It's unbelievable! I miss my bed. Mum, do you want something to drink? A coffee, thanks. Mari, is there coffee? Yes, ma'am. The replacement is here. And your piña colada, María José. And a beer for Mum? Be quick about it. Careful. It's ice cold. That's what keeps... ...your hair from falling out. You look like a young swimmer. Or a water polo player. More like a paratrooper. Mum, how do you feel? The same. My stomach burns. Drink your electrolytes. You're going to get dehydrated. So you don't want the broth we made for you? I want to sleep. If you need anything, call me, OK? Good night, Mummy. - See you tomorrow. - Thanks. I hope you feel better. I love you so much. Go, Antonio! Faster! What a champ! He's excellent. I know, right? He's so great. I had no idea. I'd never been. He rules. Yet another thing I learn about him. He's a race car driver. A champion driver. Now I have more time, but he's already five and those first few years, I abandoned him a lot. - Abandoned him? - Well, I did. You're being dramatic. Stop beating yourself up. Cut off the flow of negative thoughts that cloud your mind. You're an incredible person, an incredible mum. But I don't know, you think that everyone's perfect. You're a wonderful mother. He finished. Good job! Awesome! Nice driving, Antonio! Congratulations. World's best driver! Thank you. Sweet race car driver kisses. From my little driver. - Hi, Mum. - Hello, honey. What's all this? I was looking for the property deeds. Here's the one for this house. Here's the one for the apartment in Cartagena. Are you listening? And this is for the place in Palomino. Look, these are all the Releases of Liens. Everything is in order. Only one thing worries me. I was sure I had at least four stock portfolios. And I can only find three. We'll deal with that later, I'm here every morning. I sleep here all the time. I don't want to leave you with problems. I really don't. - If I die... - You're not going to die, cut it out. You know where my jewellery is? You see? Let's not do that now. I've already started. For hours I've been going through papers. I want to finish. Behind these boxes, all the way in back, there's a metal box. I'll show you. The jewels are in a manila envelope, OK? I put it too far back. I can't get it out. You do it. All the way in the back. What were you and Toni doing out at this time of night? We went karting. There was traffic coming home. - This old box? - That's it. Look. María José would like this one. I want her to have it. It's pretty. You never wore it. I don't like jewellery. When I was young, I did, but not anymore. This one is classic, but it's beautiful and modern. It's for you. - Wasn't it Granny's? - Yes, it was my mother's. Beautiful. - Is it for me? - Yes, it's yours. This pearl necklace too. Since you like black, it will look good on black. Thanks, Mum. I saw Daniel and we discussed your case. We both think it looks good. There will be obstacles, but it will be fine. It won't be that serious. It will be long and unpleasant. Do you have other projects? What kind of work will you do? What were you thinking? I don't know. Nobody will hire me. Of course they will. Not in the public sector of course. But in the private sector, with your knowledge and experience, I think you have every chance. It depends whether you want to work under someone. I don't know, exactly. I think I'd rather be self-employed. Through a friend, I was offered an opportunity to represent an NGO. It sounds great. It could be really interesting. I'd finally get to argue a case. - A new competitor. - You bet. That would be funny, after everything you've said. I bet you'd be better than me. Look... ...I wanted to talk to you about Antonio. He's asking about his father again. That's to be expected. We knew it would happen someday. What do you plan to do? Are you going to tell him? I plan on telling him the truth. It's only fair to him. I have to tell him... who it is. I wanted to ask you something, but it's not up to me, I was wondering if you would meet him. You've caught me off-guard. What do you mean by "meet"? What for? From the beginning we agreed, it was your wish, that it would be all or nothing. I can meet him, but you have to tell me which it is. I don't know. I figured you could meet so he can see where he gets his looks from. And so you can see your son. This may not be the best moment. There's your mother's condition. I hope she'll pull through and that soon... Enjoy your meal. And there's your situation. You don't know what you'll do, you have hard choices to make. Getting the kid mixed up in that... It may not be the best time. Of course, you can count on me. But I'd like us to decide, at least for my part, calmly, and let things happen naturally. And if your mother gets better, the conditions will be more favourable. You mock the guy's experience. Some experience! Ten years he's been taking yagé. Near Bogotá, this shaman, from who knows where, sells vacation packages. He's a real shaman, he's been doing this for years. I assure you, a good bender out in the countryside, is cheaper and more practical and just as much fun. Without the ethno-astrological new age marketing. Are you into non-textual communication? - Telepathy? - Of course. Above all, I'd like to toast Silvia who is here tonight. Now that we can agree on! Thanks for being with him. And putting up with him. We love him, but he's a handful. He's always been that way. But this is the first time he's had a girlfriend his age. She's even older than me. By three years! I don't discriminate. Since we're being politically correct. What a bullshitter! Don't overreact. This isn't really worth... ...making a scene about. I'm not overreacting. I sat there feeling awful for two hours with a bunch of total strangers. They're my friends. I just wanted us to have fun. - You wanted to hit on that girl. - I didn't hit on anyone. We were with my friends to talk and have fun and that's what I did with that girl. I talked with my friends like normal people do. We were kidding around. If I ignored you, I'm sorry. I'm a little drunk. Let's go home, relax. Let's not overreact. - Come on. - I'm not going anywhere. Are we gonna stand here all night? No, I'm going. - Where? - Home. It was awful. It's the last time. I don't need this. I have enough troubles as it is. I have problems with everything. Don't make problems where there aren't any. This is your fault. Not at all. If I fucked up tonight, I'm sorry. I don't want to see you anymore. It doesn't work between us. I don't want to be in a relationship now. I can't. All this because of one night? No, there must be other things. What other things? Don't throw this shit at me without explaining anything. I'd like to understand. It's over. I don't want us to be together. It's too hard for me, I can't take it anymore. I'm going. Goodbye. Where? Home. I'll take a cab. I can't stay here. I've had it. Are you serious? Where were you? I got stuck in traffic. We've been outside a half-hour. Mum was coughing. I left early, but it was jammed everywhere. You're always late. I always do everything wrong. You're perfect. It's not that, but you're always late. Just be on time. I tried but wasn't able to. I can't predict every traffic jam. There's traffic every day. Exactly. Which is why I left early. Stop bickering. Silvia thinks she's perfect. It's so annoying. Fine, so I'm always wrong. Handle everything next time or let me do it. I'll handle it then. Should I pull over? Are you sure? I can't breathe. I want my oxygen. What could be worse than this? It will be pretty. Surprise! Hey, Toni. What's this? Champagne. What a treat! - More? - A little more. - That's enough. - For María José. Thanks. Cheers, Mum. It'll grow back fast, and look even prettier. I hope so. Cover the mirrors with newspaper. - I don't want to see myself. - Stop it. It's a great look for you. How does Granny look? Gorgeous. Young man! - Can I get by please? - Don't destroy my house! Don't destroy my house! - Some tea? - Yes, please. Sergio, can you put that near her? Taste. I made it with love. Thanks, Sergio. - You know it. - I know. Sergio, did you see any nice apartments? I saw thousands of them. But all expensive. Have you thought of a roommate? Only you. - Whatever you say. - Nobody else. I like living with you. So do I. Especially when you get home and yell at me. Doorbell! Hello. Is Silvia home? Silvia, it's for you. Majo, who was it? Abel. - What are you doing here? - You won't answer my messages. - Because I don't want to talk to you. - It's not fair. You can't just end it like that. Let's at least talk for a minute. Talk about what? About us. What did I do that was so horrible? Nothing horrible. I said all I have to say. I can't talk now. I'm not alone. - How's your mother? - Bad. I'm sorry. Can't you escape from Alcatraz for a minute so we can talk? I really can't. I'll call you tomorrow and we'll talk. Promise? OK. Give Antonio a kiss from me. I didn't make those crepes for the dog. Eat a little. What did that guy want? To talk to me. Can't I have any peace in my own home? What's your peace got to do with him coming to talk to me? The fact that that guy comes knocking whenever he feels like it, ringing my doorbell... ...it bothers me. That guy disgusts me. You don't have to like him, I do. Some taste you have. That's not your problem. Whether I like someone or not should have no impact on you. You can't stand me having a life. I moved in to take care of you. - I'm an adult. - You're still playing the victim. No, you're the victim. That's clear. Always the same story. You can't stand me having a life. If it disturbs my peace and quiet, yes, it bothers me. So I'm the one who made you sick. I'm the one making your life difficult. Do you want me to leave? I'll move back home if that's how it is. I'm not holding anyone here. If you want to leave, leave. And if Majo wants to go with you, let her go. What's this got to do with María José? I'm used to living alone. It makes your skin crawl knowing I have someone. - That I try to be happy. - At least I have dignity. If a guy humiliates me in public, I don't go and sleep with the creep. It hurts you, doesn't it, that I have a man? I raised you better than that. It makes you sick. I raised you better. How's that? With dignity! Funny, you have energy left to argue. To the very end. - Sergio. - Yes? I'm not hungry. - Put that there. - Here? - I don't understand. - Put it there. What happened? I fell down and I wet myself. It's OK. Let's go to the bathroom. You're all wet. You'll be OK. Come. - What happened? - Mum fell. Help me lift her up. What's wrong with Granny? Nothing, honey. Go back to bed. To bed. She fell, but she's all right. Want some more coffee? No, thank you. I have some left. Hurry up and eat. Finish your breakfast, honey. Drink your juice. Mari, I made a mess. Sorry. I'll clean it up. Quick, you're going to miss the bus. Are you ready? I want to say hi to Granny. Granny's sleeping, honey. No, she's awake. You can go up. Morning, Granny. Morning, Mum. He wanted to see you before school. What a cutie pie. Come give her a kiss. Get some sleep. This afternoon we have chemo. Well, we're off. Come. See you in a bit. - Bye, Mum. - Bye. Come, Otto! Wait for me! Wait a sec! It's Ms Leti... How? Mari found her this way. She'd stopped breathing. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Our sister Leticia died in Christ's peace. We remain on earth as witnesses to this peace. Let us keep her memory alive, her legacy. We must carry within us her heart and her spirit. That we may treat one other equally and always favour justice and reconciliation. Brothers and sisters, let us pray in silence. In faith and in hope. Mr Prosecutor, please proceed.

Ms Silvia Paz Medina, how do you plead to the crime of Misappropriation of Public Funds you are charged with? I plead not guilty. Hello. I saw you in the courtroom. - Thanks for your support. - It will soon be over. Thanks for Daniel, he's been great. He's an excellent lawyer. The head of the Evaluation Committee may testify. I'll believe it when I see it. It would be only natural. In three months, it will be over. If he testifies, that will be the end of it. - My fingers are crossed. - It's only fair. - Who is this young man? - This is Antonio. Say hello. - I want to go home. - Just a sec. Can you say hello? I'm Benjamín. He's a friend. He knew you when you were a tiny baby. Are you coming from school? Did you come to pick up your mummy? Yes, he came to pick me up. To go where? - Where are you taking her? - Home. Are you tired? Do you want to go rest? - He's a space cadet. - That's right. You should go home and rest. - Let's see each other soon. - Yes, definitely. Be well. Goodbye, young man. Take care of yourself. Thanks for coming. Of course. Thanks, Majo. - How about a drink? - No, I'm tired. And Antonio is exhausted. Just one beer? Some other time. - Can I drop you somewhere? - I'm going home. We're in the other direction. - Get some rest. - Thanks. Say goodbye. Aren't you going to say goodbye? Bye, little guy. Come. Want to watch a movie? No, let's play!
