PART THREE ALEXEI, NIKOLAI'S SON THE SIXTIES Hey, Alexei, I had no idea you had so many medals. I'm a modest person, Tofik. So, if you're modest, why wear them? How long have you been away from your home in Baku? Two years. I haven't been here in my village for 20 years. Elan is my homeland. Reveille, everyone! Ivan. - The beer is here. - What beer? Beer on tap. See the barrel there? You and your jokes. You have lots of medals, but little respect. Let's see here. Step back please. - Here you go! - You bastard! - Calm down, everyone. - What are you doing? I've got a sore throat. You always have a sore throat after drinking, Ivan. Get dressed, guys. My home's nearby. ELAN VILLAGE - Hold on, I'm first. - How come? I have the right. This is my homeland, Ivan. What with your hangover, it's all the same to you. Just look at him. I invite you to a reception at my family's mansion tonight. The menu includes sturgeon soup and roasted goose. You enjoyed the banya, Alexei? - Sasha! - I'm coming, Alexei. - Where did I post you? - What? - Where did I post you? - What do you mean where? - You know yourself how - - Cut the talk! Don't forget where I got you out of. Just you wait. - Okay. - Get back to work! Tofik! Wait, Tofik! You'll be in charge, Sasha. Tofik, wait! It's not locked. Just push it a little. Just push the gate a little bit. What beautiful work. They don't build like this even in Baku nowadays. Come on, Alexei. What do you mean, Tofik? Ustyuzhanin is back home. Why foot it? This is a great vehicle. Let 'em get used to it. Hey, what are you doing? Why did you have to break it? Greetings, fellow countrymen, from Caspian oil workers! Stop scaring people. Greetings to village workers from Bashkiria's workers! New machines are plowing Siberia's expanses! Lots of living space here, and attractive women - none younger than 70. That means we'll get some sleep at night. Well, granny, how about a kiss? What do you sons of bitches think you're doing? What was wrong with it? That gate was too old-fashioned anyway. This gate was made by real craftsmen. They made it to last for ages. Why the hell did you break it? Take it easy, old man. We'll restore it for you. And we thought there were only ladies of pension age in Elan, like my new girlfriends here. - Well, you're wrong. - Are you vacationing here? - Wrong again. - I don't get it. - You mean you're local? - Right. Here's a little present for you. Go and rest awhile. Local then it is. So whose are you? Not yours surely. Don't be so sure. We're not just here for a day, but for half a year, so anything's possible. - So you're a Solomin. - How do you know? Who doesn't know? Everyone knows Solomin redheads are the best girls in Siberia. I rushed here as soon as I found this out. That's all I'm here for. Well, let me introduce myself. Okay, Alexei Nikolaevich. Huh? And we know if a skirt chaser shows up in Siberia, it's surely Alexei Ustyuzhanin. Medical battalion, Second Ukrainian front, 1943, right? Wrong. Murmansk, 1953, the Caucasian restaurant? - It was terribly cold. - Wrong again. I give up. - Sochi. - Wrong. - 1956, the October Resort. - Wrong. You taught me to dance in that shed. - Raya? - Taya. Tofik, I'd like you to meet - Dear Taya. Tofik, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine. Just look at her, shameless. - This is my friend Taya Solomin. - Hello. Very pleased to meet you. This is Tofik Rustamov, my chief, a renowned oilman from Baku. Have you heard of him? A hero of Socialist Labor. Only he's hiding the medal because he's shy. A master of sports, an excellent family man. Father of five kids. Three girls, two boys. The oldest girl is 28. The youngest, still a baby. So here we are. - Thank you, Alexei. - My pleasure. - Watch the goat! - Leave me be! - You should thank me! - Dream on! - So you made it here, Nephew. - That's right, Uncle. I've been looking forward to our reunion. Well, here I am. You look great. Look at this hero of Elan. Meet my uncle Spiridon Solomin. He killed my father, by the way. Killed indeed. And paid to the Soviet authorities in full. I fought in the penal battalion. I have a medal. - I redeemed myself with blood, understand? - Sure. - And I've no regrets, understand? - Sure. What are you gonna do now? Stab me or shoot me? - What are we gonna do? - Alexei. We won't do a thing. We'll put up a derrick at the Devil's Mane and drill till we find gas. Then we'll demolish your Elan, lay asphalt and build modern houses. And we'll live with you in the same building, with all the comforts. The City of the Sun. Got it? I'm not gonna unload those transformers. - Let me smell your breath. - Ted! You have a granddaughter, pops? - Will you put me up? - You coming with us or not? How are the lodgings here, pops? Volodya, take the next hut. This one doesn't have windows. - Sasha, did someone bring my dumbbell? - What? - Did you bring my dumbbell? - Who needs it? Ask Pete. Are you nuts? Hey, Pete, did you bring my dumbbell? Get your dumbbell yourself! I wish you had killed me then. Look at that. What a beautiful thing. How beautiful. Look, will you? Oh, my. Oh, get over it. Man, oh, man! I'll be right back, guys. You monster! They're having their mating season now. You came, cursed out the old man, knocked down the gate. Give me the gun. So now you're going for the swans, huh? Give me the gun. Go on. - Taya - - Don't "Taya" me. Give me the gun. Don't you know it's against the law to shoot swans? You out of your mind or what? - Why, you're so quick. - I'm quick. I wasn't looking for you. You came of your own will. - Why here? I live in a house. - The house is for later. - It's starting to rain! - Here's a raincoat. - I'll take it off myself. - Well - You'll take it off yourself? - Yourself, you say? - Don't scratch. Hey, you're scratching me. Hold on. Wait. Move over. We're on an anthill. Move your leg, will you? That was your gun, dear Alexei. That scared me. What is it? My dearest, my sweetheart Alexei. Alexei, dear, sweet - And you - You didn't recognize me. Forgot me completely. Who could have known? You were just a kid then. And look at you now. You don't look at all like a village girl. Not by looks or by manners. I returned here six months ago. Before that I worked as a barmaid on a ship. Deluxe rooms, restaurants, velvet couches. - You liked it? - You bet. So why didn't you stay? Too much of a good thing. I have to look after Spiridon. He's mean, but I feel sorry for him. His wife's gone, so he's all alone. And how come you're not married? - Wanna know? - I'm listening. Can't you... guess for yourself? Me? No clue. Nope. It's a long story. Gee! Oh, my! People are waiting for me at the banquet. Listen, we should go back separately, okay? People will start wagging their tongues and I have my work team, after all. Okay? Great. Well, I'm off. - Nice to meet ya. - Ciao. My heart is broken That's enough, go away now We are strangers Forget about me - Where's Tofik? - At the cemetery. - Tofik! Let's go! - Where to? What do you mean where? To Devil's Mane. Let's go! Alexei, we're not setting up the derrick on Devil's Mane. - Huh? - I know. I lured you from Tataria. I know I promised we'd put up a derrick on the Devil's Mane and not here. I need you and your guys. I'm gonna work with you. Work, understand? Yes, I know it was a cheap trick. But the derrick will be right here, as designed. I know you and your dad nearly died out there because of that gas. I remember. But we have no right to put it up anywhere else! You know how it is. Some four-eyed ministry guy pokes his finger on the map, and it goes from there. Papers get moving, they put a stamp on them, then the machinery. Alexei. Do it. Do it. Drill through the old man and the old lady. Into the soul of the Holy Virgin! Drill! Drill right here! Hey, old man! Wow! You're still alive! - Hey, Alexei. - You're something, old man. You've outlived your time. About time to die already. Die? It's not the old that die but the ripe. Apparently, I haven't ripened yet. Is it a long way to Devil's Mane? No one knows for sure. I never go there, and neither should you. I don't believe in superstitions. It's the 20th century, old man. Well, sure. Go ahead. You're not in Azerbaijan now, Tofik! So that's where they drilled. Right here! Pa. Pa! Pa! Pa. - Alexei! - Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Alexei! Sasha! Peter! There's a pure gas outlet at the Devil's Mane. Come on up. Here, chickie, chickie. There you are. Hang in there. - Can I help? - I'm fine here. - You're always fine. - Give Pete a hand. - Okay. - Will you manage to drill in time? No. I hoped you'd be the first to drill in your homeland. Oh, Taya! Hi. What brings you here? I'm going to the cemetery for grandma's funeral. Grandma died? What a shame. I thought I'd take a look at you. Sasha! Come here. Go help the guys over there. Well, then. We're working here, you see. You stepped out of the woods and forgot about me. I've no time. There's a lot of work. You could have found time during the month. - How's it going, Elena? - I'm fine. Your team demands your attention, huh? Sorry, we're celebrating the test drilling today. So see you some other time. Bye. Sasha! Here, Spiridon. What's with you, Spiridon? What's with you? Listen. He dreams of enrolling in a foreign language institute. - Tofik, we are doing it! - Fyodor became a policeman. Stepanida milks the nanny-goat, then works in the field and sings. Relatives, huh? Hey, what's taking you so long? Come on, Ivan! Hey, time to start! Hurry up, will you! You're like a fly beating on a window. Don't ruin my nerves. They'll never grow back again. You'll live a long life. I wonder what they do with all the money. Oh, Kolya! For the soul of your servant who has passed on, save and protect her. For the love of people. I lived with love for you. Let my soul rest in peace. Give peace to your servant. For the love of people. Who gave birth to children. Save her soul. Let your servant's soul rest within Christ's soul among the saints where she won't know illness or sorrow. Only eternal life. Whose car is that? Solomin's, the Regional Party Committee secretary. Hello. Good to have you here. Help them out. Okay. Hello, Philip Yermolaevich. What's happened? Not good. I've been to the State Construction Committee. And? The Ministry's proposal to build a hydropower station in our region was already voted on by the State Planning Committee. Permission to start preparatory work was granted. They called a break in the morning, so I came to deliver the news. But the session was scheduled for the 15th. They made it earlier. Who did? So - Clever move, fellas. So it's that bad. The soonest flight to Siberia is at 7:45 p.m. What about the baggage? Baggage to the hotel and cancel my flight. I'm going to the Committee. USSR STATE CONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE ...prestressed concrete. That about sums it up. I won't repeat myself. As you see, we've developed enough designs for three versions of a hydropower plant. The 42-meter-high dam can have a capacity of at least 8 million kilowatts. As for the flooded areas - Victor, please. These are areas that are practically unsuitable for living. Population density is one per two square kilometers. Moving inhabitants to comfortable new homes will only be advantageous for them. And this is our city of the future, the Sun City, so to say. If you don't take the floor, it's all over. Too late. We've missed the boat. This project means oil exploration is out of the question. You no longer believe in oil either? We ourselves need for someone to believe us. But the Ministry and the Planning Committee don't. Only one thing can save us now - real live oil instead of promises. And the only place we can find it is in the flooded areas. I've been hearing that from you for eight years. You've made me a laughing stock. They say there's oil only in your sick mind. I've been rebuffing attacks on you for eight years. Yes, my shoulders are broad, but I'm not what I used to be. And I, instead of prospecting for oil, have been trying to prove that two dozen derricks is nothing for a region the size of ours. Our swampland alone is three times the size of France. You got all you asked for. Aircraft. Transportation, derricks. Not until after you intervened. And before that, people dragged those derricks through the marshes on their backs. I can't put up a derrick without permission from Moscow. As if from Moscow they can see if there is oil or not. I wanted to speak, but they didn't give me the floor. But I'm not going to give up. I promise to fight to the end. A pig is no match for a goose. Well, what? Why so late? I've just come from the airport. With this beauty, you'll now be in first place in capital investment volume. Won't he? Sure will. Congratulations. Happy to serve the Soviet Union. Congratulations. But to be honest, it wasn't so easy. Far from everyone was in favor of this project. Who was against it? - As if you can't guess. - Maybe I can. The main thing is that Siberia's development is given priority. But God forbid you find oil there. I dread to think what it would lead to. Hello? Operator? This is Solomin. The government line please. Yes, as usual. 675-78. It will be an important landmark in the life of the people in the regions. This project, the country's largest, will attract attention by its uniqueness. The plant's annual rated capacity is 36 billion kilowatt-hours. With a normal water level of 35 meters, it will reach a capacity of at least 8 million kilowatts. And regarding the land being flooded- Hey, coachman Don't drive the horses I have no place to rush to anymore There's no one for me to love anymore FLOATI NG STORE Taya! We really miss you on the ship. - No wine on tap? - Exactly. Do you have any earrings? - How much? - One hundred. - It's gold. - Too expensive. We'll take them. Are these for me? Those look good on you. Are these really for me? A present on your name day. Yeah, right. Today's a great holiday. The name day ofTaisia, Thecla. - Hold on. - Sorry. You're too educated. In our business, education's a must. Hold on. The ray of sun gets to me Through doors shut so tightly And suddenly my head begins to spin again Love can't be understood Love can't be understood True love Cannot be measured Because at the bottom of the soul It's like a still deep river Ah, those green eyes of yours Those deceitful eyes of yours On this dark night Made me go mad Taya. Did you miss me at all? You were gone for two months. - I've been working. - Bad ground, isn't it? How do you know? There are many "borerers" here. It's "borers" not "borerers." Though I happen to be a driller. I'll remember that. - Taya - - Don't worry. And thanks for the present. - Taya, I - - What, want to come in? Well, Taya - I've got some time right now. Okay, let's go. Taya. I like it. Lots of room and light. You really like it? I do, actually. I didn't expect that. Very well. Step aside. Listen, Taya, I - Oh, it's over there. We're not strangers, are we? Of course not. We're all related in Elan. That much I know. - Taya. - Alexei. You know nothing happened. - Nothing? - Nothing. - I beg your pardon? - There was nothing between us. What do you mean "nothing"? It was just a dream of yours. - That's right. - You must be joking. There's mushroom soup, fried potatoes. Here's the soup. - I don't want soup. - And pickles. I'll go get them. I'm not hungry. I pickled some cucumbers. You should taste them. Taya, have you ironed my pants? Taya? Hey, what are you doing here? What are you doing here, Alexei? What, me? Oh, hi. Having a rest before my shift. I need to go soon. - Oh, right. - And how about you? I was in the banya here. Taya's right. The steam is just great. A man needs washing, you know. I take steam baths here. - Since when? - For about a month. - Have you read this book? - Nope. Me neither. Did you radio about the pipes? - I did. - Okay. You can stay. You're not in the way. What are you doing? What am I doing? I'm looking for my pants. And what's he doing? He's reading an interesting book. - And you? - I'm bringing some pickles. Fine. Making a fool of me? Sure. Make a fool of him. It's easier. - Have a good steam, Tofik. - Alexei - Why? What a fool I am. I trusted you! Carried you with my hands! I step out for a second for some steam and find another man in your bed. Now I know who bought you the earrings. You think Tofik is greedy? I could buy you dozens of them. Tofik has given cars to women before! You floozy! I'll kill you. Then kill him and then myself. We've been sweating 18 months without leave. Okay, guys, put it on. And so the feats of our labor add up. How could you, Taya? And he calls himself a friend. He liked the steam indeed. Serves me right. I believed him, left Tataria, quarreled with that worthy man Rashat. What a fool I am. The hell with it. I'll drill this hole and then go back to Tataria and join Rashat again. But what about the Devil's Mane? No, I won't give it to anyone. I'll keep on drilling there. If I fail, I'll go to Sochi. Oh, Sochi For days and nights We mess up our lives Doing nothing but sin If you rush around all your life in sin and with poor grub, when will you get well? Come on! Move your ass! Quit wasting time! I can't do it. If you can't, go help the women carry the powder sacks. Can't you get it in, Pete? No practice with your wife, huh? Stop! Stop! It's my fault! It's my fault! My fault! I didn't shut the elevator. He kept rushing me. I signaled to you, you son of a bitch. You kept driving me too fast! - I'm telling you! - Quit yelling! Quit yelling. Call your Tofik. Step aside. You'll find him in Taya's banya. PART FOUR PHI LI P THE SIXTI ES Worthless land. I can imagine how proud and satisfied you are as the Regional Party Secretary. Why? Well - With the building of the world's largest man-made sea and hydropower station, your region will be among the country's leaders. In the water category, I'm already a leader. Pardon? You can place three countries the size of France in our swamps. This isn't my first hydro plant. But to be honest, I've never been so exited because the scale of the project is so big. It's about time we developed the Siberian backwoods. Why do you say it like that? Siberia is fairly developed. But I agree that this here is still backwoods. Exactly. Take a look. How can someone live in backwoods like this? In this hole! Seventeenth century! Yes, a hole. This hole, as you say, is my homeland. I was born in this village. Old women are all that's left. The youngsters moved to the cities. So I'd like to pay respects to my folks. And you continue on. Pick me up on your way back. Incoming. You're our last hope. Help us out. It's impossible to live around here anymore. This here thing screeches and whines so we can't sleep. Can't even have a normal calm cup of tea! How could you allow it? In your home village! The bastards are getting close to the cemetery. Once they find oil, you can say good-bye to the village. I wish they'd find some. There'll be nothing here soon. What do you mean? The whole place will be flooded. And a sea will be made. What do you mean a sea? Well, a sea. Water. The world's largest hydropower plant. Phil, can't you tell them in Moscow about us? That's where the decision was made. And thank God. Great idea. Just flood it all, and the hell with it. And nothing to worry about. What are your shooting for? The godson's here. I'm gonna shoot you down as a saboteur. Let go. Let go, damn it! I'll shoot him at point-blank. You're wasting the land, all our riches! Oil, gold, forests! And you want to flood them? Saboteur and wrecker! I used to shoot enemies of the people like you. At point-blank! He almost shot you. Why didn't I smother you, my godson, in the cradle with a pillow? I'll never forgive myself for this stupidity. Don't listen to him. - It's the vodka in him. - He's always been crazy. Philip dear, do you really want to drown us? Drown us at the bottom of the sea, dearest? Have mercy, dear. We want to live a while longer. Don't listen to them, sonny. Don't feel sorry. I'm not, Granny. It's wasteland anyway. Cursed land. But we don't have any other homeland, do we? Screw it all. They'll decide everything and sign the papers. They know better. Flood it. The main thing is that you hold on to your post. You're the only guy from our village up there. I, too, have no one but you all. Oh, you! Hey, women, you let him be. Let him visit his folks' graves. We're not bothering him. "Buried here is the body of God's servant Yermolai Solomin" Hey, old man. Phil. The earth remains silent. Did my herbs help you? No. An elk cow was hunted down or shot to death. Ah, people. They can fly in the sky but still haven't learned how to behave on the ground. Aren't you sorry this land will be flooded? It'll get rid of the gnats at least. Phil? Phil? I've ruined it. Ruined it. Ruined this land. It'll be flooded. This village, these graves, all will be flooded. I gave in in a weak moment when I should have grabbed hold with my teeth and stood my ground. I'm ashamed. Oh, I'm so ashamed. Ah, Phil. Seems like a weak moment indeed. Seems you forgot that you can't be exiled farther than Siberia anyway. Come on! Catch up! - Howdy! - Hi. - What's your name? - Is that necessary? Listen. Give me a hand here. - What about him? - He's singing. Come on. Keep singing. - Give me a hand. - Fair enough. Palma, come here. Hold it. Got something in my boot. You like the way he sings? I do. My man. He respects me. By the way, he got out of jail a week ago. - Want a drink? - No, thanks. Hit it! If you want a drink, have it now. No drinking by the derrick. Prohibition's in effect over there. Tofik will tear my head off if he finds out. - He'll tear it off, but we're carrying this there. - This is a special occasion. I'm in for a good thrashing, So I took the case, and I'm going to patch it up somehow. What did you do? - I wrecked some equipment. - That happens sometimes. Why beat a man? I got all worked up and nervous. When I saw those guys, I got scared and ran away. Tofik's been trying to get the plug out for two days already. He's the only one who can get it out. He's a great guy. After the war, we worked in Tataria together. He earned the Hero of Labor medal there. Why did the Hero of Labor put up the derrick next to the cemetery? After all, it's a holy place for people. You know - Wait, wait, wait. - Were you in Murmansk in 1952? - I wasn't. Your mug looks familiar. Are you an oil boss? Set it down. - What are you, a boss or something? - Sort of. So what's this bullshit about the cemetery? Don't you know? Some four-eyes in Moscow poked his finger at the map, and then we come and find out where we're supposed to drill. We're talking about full-scale drilling! But Tofik, moved the derrick from the cemetery to over there. If it wasn't for him, we'd be drilling through bones. He'll get some heat over that. Not if you find oil. There's none there, I bet. There's oil at the Devil's Mane for sure. There's no oil here in Elan. Ever heard about the place? I'm from here. My father and grandfather are buried here. I won't be. I'm leaving. The name's Ustyuzhanin. My whole family's here. - Nikolai's son? - That's me. You knew my father? Yeah, we've met. No! Well, I never. He sure wouldn't have let things be like this. I meant to write to the Regional Party Committee. - Why didn't you? - Ah, you know - You've no guts, unlike your Dad. Excuse me. I don't know you. I can carry the box myself. I can give a hand. Let's go. You don't believe me about the Devil's Mane, but I am still dreaming about it. I was there with Dad as a kid. How's it going? Seems we got it. Here he comes. Look. Thanks. I'll take it from here. Bug off, will you? There we are. Hold on, hold on. Come here. Stand over here. Play on. Fellas! I've come to say good-bye. I'm leaving tomorrow. - Shut up, will you? - Tofik! Hey, what's that for? I didn't do anything to you. Tofik, I brought a box of champagne. They've got a box of champagne here, and you're acting like strangers. I got out of jail just yesterday, and you - We've come to make peace with you. You came to us, and we came to you - - Enough gabbing. - Isn't that so? The won't let a man have a drink for peace. - Hush up. - Stay away from them. I told you they're gonna beat me. Any minute now. Hit it, Gypsy! Keep it up! Tofik, come on over and dance! Oh, yeah! Leaving? And who's gonna let you? I, Tofik Rustamov, tell you, not until you clean up your shit. I'll chain you to the derrick. Then we'll see how you dance. You think you'll be a driller? No! You're gonna carry clay and mix mortar day and night. Until you undo all your wrongs, no food, no drink, no sleep! Shut up! Hello, Rustamov. Philip Yermolaevich. This can't be. What a treat. The region's first party secretary at our project. Hello, Philip Yermolaevich. - Is it true the place will be flooded? - You know too? The radio girls told me the secret. The whole region is blabbing the secret. Will our team be disbanded? Not just yours. The 18th, 20th and 30th as well. The whole region. You're joking, Philip Yermolaevich. No jokes. No more wasting the people's money. This is a promising location! You know it yourself! - Don't you believe me? - Not anymore. Give me some oil from this land. A bucketful at least. - I'll give you two bucketfuls. - When? I don't know. And I need it now. At least a bucketful right now. I can't. There isn't any now. There isn't? You know why there isn't? Because you've allowed anarchy all around, irresponsibility and boozing. Whose fault was the accident? Mine. You're a liar to boot. Well, did you make up? I'm a level-6 driller with 42 wells to my credit. Time to calm down, Ustyuzhanin. I've got a right to drink to my dad. Well - Drink with me, party boss. To a man like him, I will. - Where might I have seen you? - Don't you recognize me? You're the spitting image of your mother Nastya. Yes, the spitting image. If you remember, you owe me a crate of champagne. Time for me to go, Alexei. I'm leaving. - Bye. - Write me. I can't write. I'm illiterate. Hello, Gypsies, so early in the morning Forgive me for what I'm singing Don't think that it's about you personally I'm talking about all the Gypsies I wish you happiness To live happily Happily with your family With good people close by You are a Siberian Gypsy A Russian Gypsy Hold yourself with dignity in society I ask nothing more of you Rour out, my dear song Use joy to charm hearts Go away, my trembling sorrow - Give the full road to happiness - This is my taiga. Open up your arms, my song Afanasy's road. Take me away to a starry place Tell us that we brothers Have only one mother The beautiful land Hello, Theodore Nikolaevich. Hello, Solomin. What to you think you're doing, Philip? What? Last Wednesday we tried to find out the reasons for the delays in the power plant construction in your region. And on that very same day- Have a seat. On that very same day, your regional paper featured an article against the construction and, naturally, against the decision that was made. So, you're sticking to your guns? Yes. - Philip. - Theodore Nikolaevich - Philip. We're old friends. We've always seen eye to eye. When you were a candidate, I was the first to vote for you. But now I know it was a mistake. In wartime, I'd entrust a corps or an army to you. But I now see that some people were right. You can't handle a region. You don't understand that it's also a matter of politics. You're right. It is politics. I was in Africa last summer. The conditions are different there. Poke your finger in the sand, and oil gushes forth. What does Africa have to do with this? As I see it, in this decade, oil will have a bearing on all international political issues. You're in charge of a region, not the foreign policy department. Today they're becoming inseparable. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to deal with national economic problems. I'm deeply convinced of this. Right after the revolution, Lenin spoke of the need to develop Siberia's rich natural resources. For 40 years, we've been interrupted by war, economic dislocation, rehabilitation efforts, another war. Now we can finally develop our land. But easier said than done. We can't just poke our finger in the sand like someplace in Arabia to get oil. You've worked on-site. You know we need machinery. Yes, okay. Just think of it. Oil, gems, metals, gold, gas - all underwater. Why all? A total of 130 square kilometers. The northernmost man-made sea looks nice in reports. But why on our water-meadows, rich floodplains, 400-year-old villages, large tracts of valuable lumber and our main wealth, oil. Thank God I've no grandchildren yet. What would I say to them if they asked me? Stay there. Theodore Nikolaevich. I'll come later. Start without me. And what if there's no oil there? - There is. - But they haven't found any. They will. We just need to untie the hands of those who have dedicated their lives to studying Siberia. Without Moscow's blessing, they can't even put up a derrick. - Too many babysitters. - This can be resolved. As for the hydro plant - Ted, just think of the war, and our marines. We wouldn't have won if we hadn't taken chances. You're a real daredevil. Back me up. You must. That's the only way we'll win. And what if there's no oil after all? We can't be exiled any farther than Siberia. Alexei Nikolaevich, want to see the new core? - What? - They pulled out a new core. So what? - What if they found oil? - Sure, right. Just look at all this oil. No oil around here. You think this is Saudi Arabia? Here it's just one word - Elan. You owe us a bottle, Alexei! It's our last day of slave labor, so don't forget. Can I come in? Come on in. - The third shift is over. - And? - I've been doing grunt work a whole month. - And? - Am I forgiven? - Well - Am I forgiven by everyone? Tomorrow you can go back to your former job. - So I'm forgiven? - Yes. Then sign this please. My resignation. I'm leaving. - Leaving, huh? - Yes, leaving. I, Alexei Ustyuzhanin, prospector- I have a medal - a level-6 driller, did grunt work for a month. Who gained from this? No one. I can haul sacks if I have to, but if it's for nothing - You want to discipline me? - Why? The orphanage already did. - So, you're leaving. Yes. But don't feel offended. It's just that - Okay, we'll drill at the Devil's Mane without you. You're lying. I don't believe you anymore. You don't have the guts. You tricked me into leaving Tataria. Sign it, please. Oh, you do have something to write with. Okay. - Thanks. - Leave, but just do it fast. Very well. Tofik, my dear friend. Now get lost. I can tell you why you signed it. I crossed your path. It's that girl, isn't it? Oh, Tofik. Look, you bastard. How long have you known Tofik Rustamov? - Did he ever cross anyone's path? - Tofik. Or offend anyone? You can stay. I've never taken anyone's leftovers. No, Tofik. I'm going. So what is this? You're leaving and I'm staying? Why did you bring me here in the first place? And what about the guys? Hey, guys! - He's leaving. - This is it, guys. Last payday. - Petrov. - Right. - What are you talking about? - Peter. Alexei, I don't want you to leave. Stepan! - Alexei's leaving. - What? Why, Alexei? Don't listen to him. What are you talking about? Alexei, maybe just one more time? Are you kidding? To your places. Take your places. Here we go. Dance away! Can't you stay, Alexei? How about it? Come on over here. Taya! Why are you so dressed up and with a suitcase? It's an early winter. The swans are flying south, and so am I. - So you're leaving? - Yes. I'm bored, Taya, bored. I came here to let out a gush of oil like Dad wanted. - As for holes, I can drill them anyplace. - Of course. Off to Sochi, dear? Yes, Sochi. I've come for you. Pack up, Taya. What are you looking at? I'll take you with me. That's how it is. Go on. - You're very kind, Alexei. - Huh? You're very kind. I might marry you. You're nice. I like you. Do you remember what you asked me? - What? - Why I'd never married. I waited six years for you after the war. You're lying. Six years. Then I got a job on a ship to try to find you in Sochi. Yes. But Salekhard is far away from Sochi. The opposite direction actually. I've a confession to make. I've never set foot in Sochi. - Honest. - You're kidding. I saw it in the movies, dreamed of it, but never had the time. First the orphanage, then the war, now oil drilling - poking holes in the ground. It's a long way down there. I don't have enough money. - Was that true, what you said? - What? About waiting for me. Yes. Marry me. I can't. And you won't have me. Yes, I will. - I will. - No. I'm pregnant. From whom? Taya. I'll take you the way you are without looking. Is this your coat? Come on. Pack up. - There, take your things. - Alexei, I can't. - It'll be fine. - Just a minute. Well? Ready? Good girl. Pack up, Taya. I'm not going. I'm not going, Alexei. I don't want you. - Your child won't have a father. - You think you're the father? No, no, Alexei, no. I already have a baby, and I don't need anything else. And I certainly don't need you. So there. So you don't need me. Only my country has always needed me. And no one else. Your luck, dear Alexei. Looks like you weren't born with a silver spoon. Okay, Taya, God willing, I'll be okay. Take care. What? You're leaving already? You're a fool to let your chance slip. Honey, sweetheart, leave quickly, please. Leave quickly. - Where are you going? - No! It's no use. Leave! The screw threads broke loose! Get back! Get back! - Everybody alive? - Yes. Look at it. Look at it gushing! Alexei! Alexei, dear! Sasha! Sasha! Alexei! Almost half of its territory is suitable for oil and gas exploration. So why is it, that after investing so much in the oil project in West Siberia, and after looking at the geological map of the region, we can't find the courage to say that searching for oil and gas in that area is hopeless? "The Elan site has yielded a gush of oil and gas. Driller Alexei Ustyuzhanin died trying to stop the gushing." Even though it's sad, let's face the truth that there is no oil in West Siberia. I, Tofik Rustamov, tell you, not until you clean up your shit. I'm from here. My father and grandfather are buried here. - I prefer champagne. - If we survive, I'll get you a case of champagne. Comrades. Comrades. Please forgive me. I'll say only a few words. Here's a telegram. It just came. Siberia does have oil. Plenty of it. Why so quiet? There was an accident. A man died. Who? A Siberian, a war veteran, a master driller, a simple working man. Ustyuzhanin, Alexei Nikolaevich. Let's stand up to honor his memory. Beacon, Moon calling. Answer me. Over. Beacon, Moon calling. Moon calling. Send an armored carrier over here. Do you read me? That's the end of them Ustyuzhanins. None left in the whole world. Lived as a non-man and died as a non-corpse. No, it's not the end of the Ustyuzhanins, Spiridon. It's his baby that I'm carrying. - Oh my! - Hold me up! Who do you think you are? I was a Red partisan! So what? Let me go. They won't let us pass. - Why not? - Too much gas they say. My grandfather's three brothers and daughter lie there. All my relatives! Hold off. It's your life they're guarding. I don't want this stinking life if I can't go to my parents' graves. What are you upset about? My friends, I've fulfilled my promise to your village. We've upheld our native land. Just look at that power and beauty. The graveyard needs to be demolished. - Without delay. - Are you nuts? Oil may burst out any moment. Right here. Come on, Phil. Take charge. There may be an explosion. Comrade Solomin! - Can't we save it? - Comrade Solomin! - Just let me - - Solomin! Comrade Secretary! Go on, you! - Go! - Hold it, Frol!
