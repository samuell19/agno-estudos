"Statement of Marui LLC" "In the summer of 2019, an empty van was found near a temple in Busan." "Owner of the van, Kim Su-chan was filming a documentary at the time." "The police have confiscated footages found in his computer," "but thanks to property rights lawsuit, his footages were returned." "It was decided that his footages would be edited and screened." "Narrator heard in this documentary is that of producer Kim Su-chan." Tell us what you said during dinner the other day. Okay. "Hong Eun-hee 31, News One, City Desk" I'm Hong Eun-hee from the city desk. I do a lot of reporting from the prosecutor's office. Between prosecutors, evidence videos that exhibit extreme level of violence and gore that can't be released to the public are known as 'marui' tapes. There is a rumor that these tapes are locked away in their basement. Among the marui tapes, there are some that... A murder took place in 1992 at an inn near Busan. The inn clerk brought his girlfriend and filmed her, only to kill her violently afterwards. The video was said to be so brutal that it was sealed up to stop it from being leaked. But it was for an entirely different reason why it was so popular among the prosecutors. "Prof. Yoon Hyun-sik" I remember "61, Witnessed Video as Prosecutor" We all watched it because it was said to be possessed. Something odd was filmed. Someone appears in the mirror and disappears. It looked like a face of a young man. It was a hazy image, at an impossible angle. As students, we wore black uniforms and hats. The image had a similar look. "Busan Metro Police Evidence Storage" Could we find the tape? We confirmed the tape's existence at the police evidence storage. "Video tape (8mm)" "Busan Prosector's Office" When you go down, the ceiling will be black, as if filled with molds. Bloody pants, knives and others are stored there. "Restricted Area Authorized Personnel Only" I guess energy from those rotted out the ceiling. It's eerie staring at it. "Photos of Evidence Storage, circa 2001" It was hard to believe that the ceiling went black due to objects of the deceased. Evidence from closed cases are destroyed after 20 years. But protocols aren't always followed. We tend to destroy them when we move or clean. Shredders are called in to shred or burn them. "On-site shredding service" "Specialized in security document and hard drive shredding" Who are you? We did whatever we can do to find the tape, but it was likely to have been destroyed a long ago. Su-chan, check this out. I wanted to pass it off as an urban legend. But this story refused to leave my mind, and we decided to make a documentary. But... no one could have known where we'd end up. "Marui Video" "Busan District Court" "Busan High Court Murder Case" The prosecutor in charge died from a chronic disease. He retired as a lawyer and died in his mother's home. Could there be any files relating to the case? We asked about the inn murder case tape. Those are things my son used to use... I see. "The Inn Murder Case" "The Inn Murder Case 1992" "Copy of The Inn Murder Tape" The primary detective obtained the tape and tried to make a copy, but for some reason, it couldn't be copied. "Recording of the Inn Murder Tape" He ended up filming the TV screen, and recorded a playback for evidence submission. In the tape, you could hear the detectives chatting. What could the recorded image of the man be? - Did you eat? - Yeah. Is that the camcorder? What's that? In the mirror. Why was this man recorded in the tape? "Suspect: Park Sungjun" I couldn't help it. ""No memory about the murder"" My animal instinct said it was kill or be killed. "1992 Inn Murder Case Crime Scene Recreation" The killer claimed innocence with temporary insanity. A year before his probation for his life sentence, he killed himself in his cell. We tried to interview family of the victim, but they rejected our requests. They did not want to bring back painful memories. "Dongsungjang Inn" The inn was abandoned for a while, but it's now used as long term housing for day laborers. The laborers refused to use the crime scene room. Furniture and objects from the murder were left intact. The mysterious mirror was also still there. Where are you going? Have you heard anything about a murder here? Could anyone know about the mirror man? We heard there was a murder upstairs... We asked the tenants and neighbors about it, but no one knew about him. Then we heard a rumor about the inn owner from a laborer. He had a misfortune at his old neighborhood. His bad luck led him to this place. "Lee Nam-hee/74, Real Estate Broker" He had a home in Ami district. Ami used to be a cemetery for Japanese people during the colonization. I heard some people died in his old home. He was left alone after that, and he sold the derelict house, and bought the inn here. - Derelict house? - Yes. What do you mean by people dying in the house? I'm not 100% sure, but a few people died. Where is the inn owner now? Now? He lives in the penthouse of that building. - The inn building? - Yes. "Busan International Daily" "Busan Ami Family Massacre" "Son, Cho Kyung-ho" "17-year old son mercilessly kills mother and sister" "Son commits suicide on the scene" "Family killed on Children's Day, 1987" "Back of Dongsungjang Inn" "Cho Yong-tae/70, Inn Landlord" Is it true that you sold a house in Ami before moving here? Yes, there was an unfortunate incident. The boy living there killed his mom and sister, before setting himself on fire. It was a terrible thing. What kind of a boy was he? He wasn't normal. He never listened, only read books, he fought with his mom a lot, everyday was a struggle. There wasn't a father? No, he died long before this incident took place. How did you come to own the house? I took care of the house, and did chores for them. After the incident, there weren't anyone to inherit the house, so I ended up with it. How were you related to the family? A distant relative. After returning from the Vietnam war, the father frequented welfare center, but he had died before the disaster struck. After the incident, the house was abandoned, until it was inherited to Cho Yong-tae. Could the man in the mirror be the deceased son? "Ami Derelict House" "The kitchen where Cho Kyung-ho committed suicide" "Cho Kyung-ho's room" As students, we wore black uniforms and hats. The image had a similar look. Why is the boy's soul still drifting around the inn? The neighbors called it a ghost house. Some witnessed a ghost in the front yard at night, and others heard a girl crying. While we were researching, we heard a strange rumor. It was captured on tape... It was a weird sound... "Yoon Hyun-sook/41, Ami Resident" At the time, camcorders were all the rage. We filmed my kids all over town, and when we played it back, we heard a weird noise. Someone calling for someone. It was eerie. That house was in the background of the shot. It's an infamous house. And my kid became sick that very night. Do you still have the tape? No, we don't have it. It felt weird to keep it, so we threw it out. Then we received a call from deceased Cho Eun-mi's friend. Hi, I'm Kim Hyun-jung from Ami Elementary School. "Kim Hyun-jung/40, Cho Eun-mi's Friend" I was in her first grade class. We played at her house, we also took piano lessons together. I came across a photo long after she died, and only she was looking away. It was scary, as if she knew her fate. It was frightening. Hi, I'm Cho Eun-mi from Ami Elementary School. When I grow up I want to be a teacher. I want to be a good teacher. The reason why I want to... I went over frequently, and she came over often too. I was there only a few days before the incident, I think it was her birthday. A few classmates went to play at her home. But her mother and father were fighting, so we were kicked out and ended up in my house. - Her father? - Yes. We heard that she didn't have a father. No, she definitely had a father. Eun-mi called him 'father'. Father was said to have died before the incident. Then who was the man she called 'father'? We managed to find "Lim Geum-hee/79, Ami Murder Witness" the only living witness. But due to her ailing condition, we couldn't talk to her. "May 8, 1987: Witness Interview Concerning Ami Murder Case" "Voice of Lim Geum-hee (Neighbor, 47 at the time)" I owed some money to Mrs. Moon. I was supposed to pay it back that day. Since I couldn't, so I thought I should tell her in person... I kept knocking but no answer, so I went in... There was blood everywhere, and was filled with burning smell, so I ran out of there. "Park Ok-chul/55, Lim's Daughter-in-Law" She told me the story after I got married. She didn't want to bring it up, she was too scared. It was said that the son killed the family, but there was a rumor that someone else was the killer. The mother had a man. After the incident, the man disappeared, so a lot of suspicion fell on him. Do you know what happened to that man? He's said to be a vagrant, or that he's running an inn somewhere. An inn? Inn or something. In a testimony of the murder case, "The Ami Murder Case Testimony" we found a trace of the inn owner. "Cho Yong-tae" "The Cho Yong-tae Interview" A distant relative. Why did he introduce himself as a distant relative? Your call cannot be connected... We kept requesting an interview, but he refused. "Choi Yoo-cheol/58, Detective in Charge" It was horrifying I can never forget it. It wrapped up quickly because there was a witness. "Main Room - Mother, Daughter" The son had a mental illness, and committed suicide. (Kitchen - Son) He was said to have set himself on fire. I remember the charred body. Was there a man the children called 'father'? That's half right and half false. He was a father to the daughter, and not to the son. They didn't have a father for a long time, so the brother came by to be a father figure, and looked after the house. So naturally he became close with his sister-in-law. Cho Yong-tae took his brother's place and became man of the house. And a girl, Eun-mi was born between them, Cho moved into the house "Cho Yong-tae/Uncle (38 at the time)" afte she was born. Is it possible that Cho is the perpetrator? We too found him suspicious because of the circumstances, so we thought maybe he did it for money, but no. Cho owned a cold storage at the port, and was quite well off. The house was under his name and insurances were clean too. Even so, why'd he kill his own daughter? Those are all rumors made up by gossipers. "Land Register" "Western Busan Ami District" The house was purchased by Cho in 1980, and the ownership was transferred "Cho Yong-tae" to City of Busan in 1982. This was purchased in 1980... Ami was used as a Japanese cemetery, and refugees built shacks there during the Korean War. As part of Busan's historic preservation program, the city attempted to buy up the district, but Cho refused the proposal, and transferred the ownership after a long legal battle. Development has halted in the area, so it has retained its history. Your call cannot be connected... "May 8, 1987: Recording of the Suspect" "Voice of Cho Yong-tae (38 at the time)" Name. State your name. It's Cho Yong-tae. National ID number. I don't know, I don't remember. You don't remember your own ID number? When did you start living with Mrs. Moon? Since... the girl was born. What was your relationship like? What? We received a report that you and Mrs. Moon fought often. When did you hurt your hand? Not long ago, I tripped. "Dongsungjang Inn" I tried several times, but I always get an error here. Other tapes are fine, just this one. So I digitized the footage and imported here... There is a weird sound coming from the error. It's this one. Father... ...when we played it back, we heard a weird noise. Someone calling for someone. It was eerie. The sound from the inn has a consistent tone. The space where the detectives... It was unlikely that we'd scientifically verify the sound. "Past Footages" A while ago, the camera crew found something at the house. There were traces of shamanism at the derelict house. We found out that a new shamaness who moved into the neighborhood performed a ritual there. What about the house? Why are you asking? We heard that you performed a ritual there. How did you hurt your hand? What are you doing now? What are you shooting? "Past Footages" After visiting the house, weird things started happening. "Ha Ryung-ju 48, Shamaness" Who's that woman? The one looking at the photo. She's a reporter we work with. Why did she touch the haunted photo? Where is she? She's in the hospital. She caught the flu... She suggested that we visit the derelict house. It's here, what happened here? Cho Kyung-ho, the son, committed suicide here. The kitchen ceiling looked similar to the evidence storage. It's you, the one in the front yard. Why are you hiding there? Something's there? What's that smell? That burning smell. Don't want to talk? Come here, come talk to me. You have to tell me. Why are you there? Who's that man beside you? I think it's from outside. I think it was from outside. Someone nailed it from outside. We should've stopped investigating then. 2019/05/01_SecurityCam Recordings An unexpected question swerved the direction of the doc, and we uncovered the truth behind the family in the tape. When he called out 'father', what if the son was calling for his real father? The Vietnam vet who died in the nursing home. Even if Cho was man of the house for a long time, he's still an uncle to the boy. Isn't it weird that he'd call his uncle... 'father'? Father... "Witness Lim Geum-hee's Daughter-in-Law" I remember that clearly. It was memorable, so I remember that. My mother said the boy was very loyal. Since the uncle was man of the house, took care of them and close to the mother, so the son could've called him father. But he never once did. We began searching for traces of the real father, who supposedly died in a nursing home. "… life in the welfare center..." Nuri Welfare Center "Welcome to Nuri Welfare Center" "Site of Nuri Welfare Center" This place closed down over 30 years ago. "Social Work Department" It was founded in 1973, and closed down in 1987. Director of the center was arrested for embezzlement, and the center closed down. This is the list of members. "Kim Jin-hyuk 44, Busan Social Worker" Here it is. "MS" 'MS'? It's short for 'Missing'. His whereabouts were unknown at the time of closure. So could it mean that he may still be alive? That's very unlikely, but it's possible. "Deceased" "Cho Byung-sun Father" Thank god. The alarm went off so I came to check it out. Fortunately, the servers are okay. Is this thinner bottle? I think it was arson. It could've been bad if it wasn't for the guard. What do you mean same birthday? I thought it was weird too, maybe it was manipulated... If you look here... Cho Byung-sun's birthday is July 23. Cho Yong-tae is also July 23. Same birthdays. While looking for the son's biological father, we came across a story of his father. "Kim Chae-gyun/60, Prosecutor" I was working pretty hard at the time. I went to the ER after a car accident one day. Laying in ER, I heard some commotion. I saw about 6 people rushed into the ER. They were covered in cuts and bruises. One of them was black all over. It looked like a burn mark. So I looked carefully and saw bruises. All of them were from the welfare center. So I started digging, and found crimes of incarceration, assault, neglect and even embezzlement. Cho Byung-sun... Is this Cho Byung-sun? That's what it says on top, so I guess so. It looks like Cho Young-tae, no? "MISSING Cho Byung-sun" "This patient suffers from mental illness..." She's standing over there. She started talking weird. She mentioned a whale, and kept blabbering on, so I thought she was drunk. I was worried so I got home but she wasn't here. You know she's never been like this. Hello? Hello? Yes. It's the derelict house village. I kept hearing a crying sound, the red door there. Eun-hee? Eun-hee. Turn the camera off. I have to find something... What's that smell? You don't smell it? I can smell it. It's looking for something. It won't leave her until it finds it. It has to be exorcised soon. "Site of Former Ami Playground" It's too hot to wear it... Who are you? Who are you? What are you doing there? You poor thing, poor thing... So much resentment... Can't even go to the afterlife... Who're you waiting for in the front yard? It's okay, it's okay. I know, I understand. Everything's okay. Cry, go on. Let it all out until you untie the knot in your heart. There it is, look. Don't you smell something burning? Where? You have to tell me! Hot! Hot! I'm burning to death! Do something! Hold her! It's too hot, it hurts! It hurts so much! Tell me what's wrong! I'm burning to death! Look over there. It's not hot anymore, right? I granted your wish, so return the favor. Who did this to you? Tell me. Your mom Moon Eun-ok! Your sister Cho Eun-mi! And you, Cho Kyung-ho! Who did this to you?! Good, good... Let's see what you're after. Hey. Eun-hee. Cho Byung-sun. Taken to the facility in 1975, released in 1987. He spent almost 15 years there. The facility closed down with the director's arrest, so it happened after his release. Cho was one of the perpetrators, and during the fight inside, he got a bad burn on his right hand. May 4th, Father Came Home May 3rd, Cho Byung-sun's Release May 5th, The Cho Family Massacred Cho Yong-tae's twin brother, Cho Byung-sun. He was the father of Cho Kyung-ho. When his entire family perished upon his release, he was there. Name. State your name. It's Cho Yong-tae. National ID number. I don't know, I don't remember. You don't remember your own ID? When did you start living with Mrs. Moon? Since... the girl was born. When did you hurt your hand? Not long ago, I tripped. We found Cho Byung-sun from our old footages. Did the son's soul appear here because it wanted to tell the world that his father killed his family? Did he hear his son calling? "The following found footages have been edited by Marui LLC." "May 4, 2019 A Day Before the Incident" I think I got a notification because of the cat. What happened? Eun-hee? Hong Eun-hee? Eun-hee? - Su-chan. - You okay? Remember watching that film at the theater? Which theater? That man riding the bicycle. He wanted to buy a red house, and went to catch the whale. What was it called? You don't remember? Stay home, we'll come over. What's that smell? I think I smell something burning. That short guy said he was going to that girl and wanted to buy a red house. Did he get dumped by a girl he liked? He went to see that girl several times, but why did his father say he couldn't remember? What was it called? You don't remember? Father watched it over and over again... Someone's here... Someone… Someone's definitely here, someone's here! Someone's here! I think someone's here! Take the camera. "The Inn Murder Case Original Video" Sir. She definitely left the building. When was the inn murder? I think... It was Children's Day, so May 5, 1992, right? Tomorrow's Children's Day. It's past midnight, so it's now. Where was the suspect arrested? Where are you going? That man riding the bicycle. He wanted to buy a red house, and went to catch the whale. What was it called? Father watched it over and over again. You don't remember? A man suspected of killing his girlfriend at an inn near Busan, was captured at this prayer temple. It's been 4 hours since the murder took place, the police's rapid action was instrumental in... What's that? Please help me... Over there. Han-sung... Han-sung. Han-sung... Father... Father... Why are you here? Why the hell are you here? Father... Do you know how long I waited for you? I waited everyday for you in the front yard. So why did you do it? To me... Why did you do that to us? How could you, just how... Right under my nose... Father let's end this... To verify and uncover crimes committed at this house... "Remains of Cho Yong-tae was found under the stairs." "Cho Byung-sun killed his entire family," "and presumably stored his twin's body there." "Some time later, his body was found near the temple." "Cho was said to have visited his son's shrine every year." No! It's not! "The female reporter was arrested for killing 2 of her colleagues," "but she claims that she doesn't remember anything from the incident." "Meanwhile, the police are searching for Kim Su-chan using his own footages." "I hope this tape left by my son will be of some help." "Prosecutor Choi's Mother" "The Inn Murder Case Original Video"
