For God's sake, Nick. That's it! Can't believe what I'm bloody seeing here! -Get up, Captain Ignus! -Hey, no way! Come on! Cut that football from there, man! Show me a woman that's got a good man And I'll show you a woman doing all she can To make life worth living for her good man Did you see that one? No, how come you see everything else -except us? -All right, all right, all right, come on! The first game of the season saw the worst miss of the season. What was the excuse, Nick? It bobbled. How did you miss it? It bobbled. You blind get! Stevie Wonder could have put it in! Stevie wonder's refereeing. You stupid prick! It bobbled! Two yards out! It bobbled!

You passed me nothing all day. What, just give me the shampoo! No. You want the shampoo, Sammy? Funny. Did you see your dick just then? What? Did you see what it did? No, what? It bobbled. Hey! Very good. So I says, "Can I walk you home?" And she says "You can push me if you want." Push her? She had a wheelchair in the corner. What could I say, I would have looked a right bastard if I blew it right then, wouldn't I? So you took a bird home in a wheelchair? You pulled a fricking cripple? Pushed a fricking cripple. Got to the park. She tells me she only lives across the road. I say "Will you be okay from here?" She says "I'm just like any other girl, you know?" I bet she was. So I says "Well, how can we manage?" And she says "Well you could always hang me in the park gates." So I hung her on the park gates and did the business. You gave her one on the park gates? Yeah it wasn't bad either. Ugh! I don't believe you. So I gets her down and I'm wheeling her up her path when the front door opens. Her husband? Yeah, I leg it, he legs after me. I slip on the curb. I'm thinking, shit, this is it, he's gonna bat the hell out of me. But as I'm getting up he hands me a favour. "Here you go mate, get yourself a pint." I says "Did you see what we were doing on the park gates?" All right, why? He said "Every other bastard leaves her hanging there." That's not funny. No, that's not funny, that's sick! Bridget, five pints of lager, a bitter and a blowjob. She's crazy about me. I can tell. It's a tossup between him and the elephant man. A comeback! What's so bleeding funny? It ain't you.

Keep the change. Ta. Can you give me a bit of time to think it over? Of course, yeah. 30 or 40 years? -Yes! -Ah, spraja! Told you it was big.

Sometimes they'll disappear altogether. Sometimes it won't get any worse than a tingle in the arm. If he's got it, he's got a right to know he's got it. It's stress-related. Telling him he's got it might induce an attack. What are you going to do? Nothing. But if you want to tell him, you should do so. Sorry, Charlie. Okay, no problem. I do miss you, you know. You see me all day every day. You know what I mean. I'm living with Nick now, Charlie. Right. Well that's it now, isn't it? Suddenly I'm not available.

Fun day. All of it bad. You know what it is? She knows it's gonna happen. And when it does, it's gonna go right off the Richter scale. So she's just postponing the pleasure, smacking her lips in anticipation. Otherwise, she'll have that pint over your head. How are you feeling, Nick? Much better, aye, thanks. When do I go home? Today if you like. I've asked a nurse to pop along and get a urethral swab. A what? It's nothing. The nurse will take a sample from your penis with a little swab. Okay? See you. You jammy bastard. Oh, no, all shrivelled up. Ah you're all right, she looks like she's got a good sense of humour, that nurse. And good eyesight. Quick somebody tell us a dirty joke quick.

Jesus Christ, Karen. I love you. I love you. This piece in the paper once about Ronnie Lane. Remember him? No. He used to play guitar for the Faces, you know, Rod Stewart's old group. Made a couple of solo albums himself, this braggart. Anyway this bit in the paper said he had MS. And I always knew what MS was but who knew I would get it. Couple weeks later there was a bigger article about how Rod Stewart and the rest of the band were getting together to do a charity concert. I remember thinking that was really nice. And then held out on your lean after that. Yeah I've always wondered whether Rod still keeps in touch. It won't be MS. It'll be something else. Aye. Three My lucky number And fortune Comes in threes But we Are we like numbers That even little children Seem to see No results here, I'm afraid. Besides being a bit of a cockup.

And when I knew nothing at all Shit! However, high pressure is the theme for the next several days drifting slowly northwards. That means winds will turn into the northwest. Says here cannabis might help. But it stays actually dry. But then behind this one, much cooler air will spread down. It might help. Hmm. And that'll bring frost around central eastern parts of Britain on the cloudy cool Saturday over there at the west. Probably though, mainly fine. Hello. What a friend. Tony. Tony. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. I have heard of them, yes. Well? They've ruled everything else out. All that's left is MS. Is that all he said? Well he gave me the number to the multiple sclerosis society. What's for dinner?

Missed just one game all season, from a back injury probably brought on through picking the ball out of the back of the net the previous game. What do you think of that diet? What? The diet. In the book, the essential fatty acid diet. A bit too much of hard work. We should give it a try, though. Eh, whatever. We should make a list of the foods that we can and can't eat. We? Sorry? You keep saying we all the time. Well I'm not gonna talk into steak and chips while you're eating cabbage and bean sprouts, am I? Is that right? What are you thinking? Oh, nothing. What about music? I'll do that. -What do you want? -Jesus Christ, Karen. Sorry. Since you took your love away I'm not going back to work. I know. So how do we pay the rent? We don't. We can't stay here anymore. Why not? There's too many stairs. What do you think about moving to Glasgow? Glasgow? Hmm. We could ask your family to keep their eyes open for a place. And I could get a job.

He's gotta get on with it. But I do have a choice. I could leave him. I don't want to leave him, it'd be hard to leave him, but I could leave him. And that's hard. It's harder than just having to get on with it. Karen. Stop worrying about Nick. Come here. Remember me? Yeah. I remember you. I remember when we used to sit In the government down in Trenchtown Any luck with Bridget? No. Shit. Same again? -No, I'll get it. -No, no, I'll get 'em. No man, it's my round. Shit. What?

Ask any of the lads. Why are you telling me now? 'Cause I want you to leave. I'm getting a bit sick of you, actually. Getting a bit sick of the way that you just... You just keep taking charge all the time. I mean you've got me just exactly where you want me, you got me like this!
