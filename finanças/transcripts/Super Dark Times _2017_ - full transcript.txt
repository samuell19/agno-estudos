[UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC] [MUSIC STOPS] [JOSH] Oh, my God. This kid looks like he suffers from Goblets. [ZACH LAUGHS] You can't say that. He was in a fire, you know. - [JOSH] Was he? - [ZACH] Yes. He was in a... [JOSH] Well, the fire made him look really funny. [ZACH LAUGHS] [JOSH] This kid looks actually spot on like a bagel. [ZACH LAUGHS] What are you talking about? [JOSH] This kid looks like an ice sculpture. She always reminded me of a backpack. [ZACH LAUGHS] [JOSH] Always. Jasmine Stamford. Would you? I think so. [JOSH] She would snap your dick off. What about her? Probably. She's blonde though, I don't really... You don't like blondes? Since when have you not liked blondes? [JOSH] I don't know. I don't know what I want anymore. [ZACH] Oh, wait a minute. I think we all agree that Ms. Barron is hot as shit. Oh, Ms. Barron! She is fucking ridiculous. So fucking sexy. She should not be allowed to be a teacher. [ZACH] What about her? [JOSH] Mm. [GASPS] Allison Bannister. Obviously. Obviously. Anytime, anywhere. - Anywhere? - Anywhere. Son, I'd do that shit for the talent show, if that's what it took. That is disgusting. On stage, in front of everyone. Fuck yes! What, you wouldn't? - At the talent show? - Yeah, whatever. - No. I mean... - [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Obviously... Okay. Allison is very cute. We know that, yeah? And she's very cool. But, like, we know her. You can't be saying this... I don't know. I like her. Yeah, I like her too. Yeah. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. We actually know her. I actually hang out with her sometimes. It's just weird to be talking about her. Hang out with her? Yeah, like, in... Like group stuff, you know, in school. Like in history class or something. You got any drinks? Yeah, like, caffeine-free Coke. Well, then... Man, I hate the fucking winter. It's such a goddamn schlep to do anything. "Schlep"? What are you, a grandpa? The cold, it's debilitating. It's awful. It hurts my face. I don't know. Christmas rules. Anyway, it gets really pretty when it snows. - "It gets really pretty"? - Yeah, it does. All right, Mom. We're going out for a bit. I'll make sure to be home for dinner. I love you. Bye. Bye. - [DOOR SHUTS] - [KAREN] Huh? [ZACH] You know when you're in your maximum velocity and the gears just don't work anymore? [JOSH] No, I have no maximum velocity. My power is untethered and ever-growing. [ZACH] Do aliens even have feelings? Dude, I don't care if they have feelings. The Silver Surfer is the loneliest dude in the galaxy. I don't... I mean... The Punisher's pretty haunted, dude. Look, you have no idea what you're talking about. Don't even start me in with that Punisher shit. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Shit. Is that Daryl? [ZACH] Leave him alone. What's up, cock fighters? What, you wanna go? Huh? - Hi. - I'm Josh. You don't go to our school, do you? No. Callaway Middle. Yeah. Go Cougars. Oh, you're... You're Carol's little brother? - Yeah, I'm Charlie. - Oh, right. Carol Barth. I know who Carol is. Everybody knows who Tig is. Come on, man. Tig Bitty Bart. - You love it. You love it. - Oh, my God. Stop. You smell like a cat box. These are fucking chopped onions. What are you getting? Nice. Ew. Melon soda? Sounds gross. They wouldn't make it if it was gross. They make gross stuff all the time. Pickles are gross. - Pickles are not gross. - I like pickles. Hey, what do you... What do you make of that thing? Oh, that's been there forever. Dried squid? Holy shit! It's pretty gross. Somebody eats it. Nobody eats this shit. Let's get it. - Yes! - Thank you. Oh, shit! Squid. Squid. Squid. - I wanna see you eat it. - Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Come on. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Oh, God. [LAUGHTER] Great. Give me some of that shit. - Try this. - You guys are whacked. [CHARLIE] Seriously? Oh, my God, that's... [ZACH] Don't do it. Don't do... Oh! [CHARLIE] Oh, my God! It's horrible, isn't it? It's not terrible. It's not Skittles either, is it? [JOSH] No, it's not Skittles. Skittles is fucking delicious. Fuck this fucking shit. Oh, fuck! It's nasty. Oh, my God! [JOSH] Guys, lately I've been thinking a lot about hands. [ZACH] What the fuck you thinking about hands? [JOSH] If I got one or both hands cut off, what kind of prosthetic hands I would wear. [ZACH] If I lost a hand, I'd definitely get a hook. [DARYL] Yeah, fucking hook. [CHARLIE] Like from Peter Pan? Seriously? [JOSH] But why stop there? There's so many different types of hands. You could have a hot hand that just cooks steaks. [CHARLIE] A fucking hot hand is not a fucking thing. You could fucking have lighter hands. Fucking set shit on fire. [CHARLIE] Why is this bridge even closed? [ZACH] Yeah, what the fuck? You guys didn't hear? Somebody died. No one died. - Somebody died? - Yes. Don't fucking cry, Charlie. Everybody fucking dies. [CHARLIE] I'm not gonna die. I'm fucking immortal. Like Highlander. Hey, wait up, you motherfuckers. [JOSH] Tomorrow marks the end of my week-long fast from masturbating. [ZACH] Why the fuck would you ever do that to yourself? [JOSH] Because if you wait like a week, it feels really good when you go back to it. [DARYL] Guys, yesterday my parents fucking rented that movie True Lies. And after they went to sleep, I fucking watched that scene where she stripped over and over and over and over and over. I must have jerked off two and a half times. - [CHARLIE] Is that a record? - [ZACH] We don't wanna hear this. [DARYL] I tried for three, but my dick got sore. So I went to the freezer to get some ice, but there was none in the tray. So I got a fucking steak instead. [JOSH] Ugh. You put it back in the freezer? [DARYL] Fuck no. I cooked that shit up, scarfed it and passed out on the couch. [ZACH] Dude, that's fucking disgusting. [DARYL] You fucking idiots. Of course I fucking put it back. You know, that doesn't make it better. Someone's gonna eat that. Oh, my God. This is not the point of the fucking story. What is the point of the story? - I'm getting to it. - He's getting to it. The point it, bitch be hot. Like Charlie's sister. - [LAUGHS] - Shut the fuck up. Or Zach's mom. Yes. Sorry, Zach. You think if you jump from up here on a boat down there, you could break through the deck and sink it? [CHARLIE] Like in a cartoon or something? [JOSH] I doubt it. My uncle did it one time on the Fourth of July. No, he didn't. Yeah, he did. He won a thousand bucks, but broke his fucking leg, 'cause he slipped on a fish. [CHARLIE] Guess that evens out then. Fuck, yeah. Slickest shit I ever saw. [JOSH] I could do it. Are you special forces? [JOSH] No, but my uncle was. So fuck you. [SERENE MUSIC] ♪ [BIRDS CHIRPING] [ZACH] I guess I just, like, feel bad for Daryl, you know. We used to hang out a lot in third grade. And it's not his fault that his dad's fucking poor. [JOSH] Still, it doesn't make him not a douchebag. [ZACH] He's not a douchebag, Josh. [JOSH GROANS] Look, he can be a little much sometimes, but it's not like he ever means anybody harm. Still hang out with him like in school? We have health together. He's always trying to hit on Cindy Maples. Cindy Maples is the one that went to the hospital because she had a frozen hot dog in her vagina? Yeah, yeah. That's her. Cool. [MAN] Give me that bong, Amber. Shit. Josh, we have to go.

You could leave her a note if you wanted. "Dear, Allison. I had this idea for the talent show." Ever told you of that time with the glue bottle? No. It was like... You know, it was like last year. I'm doing art and you know when like... In the glue bottles, when the glue dries over on the top - and you can't open it? - Uh-huh. So she was trying to open this glue bottle, she couldn't get it. I don't know, she was just struggling for some reason. And I just couldn't stop staring at her. And then all of a sudden, the whole thing just ruptured. Just went... Shit, there's white glue all over her hands. And she just looked and whispered, "Whoops." It was the most erotic moment of my life. You know, 'cause the glue is like sperm. Oh. So the bottle is sort of like the [SHOUTS] penis! Dude, come on. What the fuck? Nobody is here. Nobody is here, Josh. - The car's not in the drive. - There's other people.

I don't like them. They burn the roof of my mouth. [DARYL] Because you're doing it wrong. Charlie's mom always keeps the fridge stacked with these. I like Charlie. 'Cause he's smart, his sister has big tits, and he always has fucking snacks. Where is Charlie? Probably sucking a dick. He said he wanted to hang out later. Daryl, don't sit on the counter.

I'm just saying that we should probably get our story straight... There is no story, Zach. Yeah, well, if somebody asks. I don't remember. I don't remember what I did last Tuesday. So why would I remember what I did this Tuesday? Probably I went home after school, stayed there alone until my parents got home. It's what I do most weekdays. Okay, that's good. Okay, so why did you come running over here to the middle school to talk to an eighth grader you barely know? Zach.

I had a call from his mom earlier. Guess he never came home last night. He hasn't been home yet at all. Did you see him at school today? I mean, I didn't see him. But I wasn't looking for him, so... I have no idea. Do you remember the last time you did see him? Nope. No. His mother said something about him going at Josh's yesterday. Uh, no. He didn't? - At Josh's house? - Yeah. No. No, he wasn't there. - He wasn't? - No, I was at Josh's all day. He wasn't there. It was just us. Okay. I'll tell her. You came home a little bit late last night. Yeah, I guess. Don't do that anymore. I'm sure Daryl will turn up, but if something happened or some... I don't know. Just stay close to the house for the next few days, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Tell me how... What time did you... Every one of us must fight the struggle within our own spirit. We have to decide whether we will define our lives primarily based on who we are or who we are not, based on what we are for or what we are against. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] All right.

I'll be right back. That's it. Breathe. Count to eight. There you go. Better? A little better. You haven't eaten anything, Zach. That's probably what's wrong. I took some NyQuil. NyQuil? Could have been that. Why were you taking NyQuil? You have a cold? I just can't get to sleep. Okay. Well, no more of that, all right?

Yeah, I'm sorry. How are you? Yeah. Me too. I'm not getting any sleep. You know, my heart, it'll just start beating sometimes real quick. Speed up. All of a sudden, just... I feel like we should go back. - Why? - I don't know, but I... To check on him, you know, to see. I keep having these dreams and I'm thinking that... I don't know. I just don't think it's right to leave Daryl out there all alone, you know. We got to do something with the body. Or at least let somebody know that he's there. Be cure... I don't know. I just keep thinking of his mom. You know, what's she thinking. She's probably waiting for him to come home. Don't go back there. Scene of the crime. Yeah. Do you still have his stuff? What? The bag? Do you still have the bag... Yeah, yeah. It's here. Like, that's good. Just, I guess... Would you just keep that hidden here? Yeah. It's here until I decide to burn it or whatever. Will you not do that? And can you... Josh, it's kind of important that you, you not do something without talking to me about it first, okay? I mean... If that's okay. Whatever. What game is this? [SIGHS] Josh, what game is that? It was a fucking accident! Okay? It happened. A fucking accident. Just... What, are you trying to break your other hand now? Yeah, it's... Allison Bannister is having that party this weekend. We should probably go. Maybe. I haven't gotten that much sleep either, so... I probably should... That'll be good for you. [GAME RESUMES] And if anybody asks, we didn't see Charlie or Daryl that day, okay? If anybody asks, we're already fucked.

He came in with all attitude this morning. Like totally ignoring her when she called on him. So she goes, "I don't recall you being deaf, Josh." And he was all, "I don't recall you being such a dumb cunt." [ALL LAUGH] [GIRL 1] What did she say? [GIRL 2] She sent him right to the office. - [BOY] Just now? - [GIRL 2] Yeah, like ten minutes ago.

Isn't your brother gonna notice that that stuff's missing? [ALLISON] Got it. Come on, guys. Come on, man. Okay, it's a page from the Bible, but it's not an important one. It's like from the introduction or something. The point is, it will work. I've seen my brother do it like a million times. Smells so good. Where'd you get this shit from, Josh? For real. Um, I know a guy. Can you hook me up? Uh, yeah. Talk to me tomorrow. Cool. We have enough for two. But Allison gets to go twice first, because she's the birthday girl. [JOHN] Fuck that.

[BOY] Dude with with blue hair. When? When the fuck did this happen? They found him yesterday. He fell off the bridge. - Fuck! - I know. I had algebra with him. Small fucking world. Yeah, it seems to be. I was supposed to buy some weed from him today too. He said he was going to hook up from some other dude. I'm not getting my weed. Hey... You got some weed? Yo, you got some weed? [ECHOING] Hey, you got some weed? [ALLISON] I walked in on him once in the bathroom. In the bus bathroom on that trip to the Flight Museum. Do you remember that? No, I didn't go. Oh. Well... He didn't lock the door for some reason, and I saw everything. Full Whitcomb. Mm. You're friends with Tig, right? Who? Carol Barth. Yeah, sort of. Do you have her number? Somewhere at home. I'd have to look it up. Here. Got a marker? Yeah. We're gonna take that... Trade. So, what's this? It's my new number. My own line. Mom and Dad's birthday present.

[ALLISON] What? That John... He fell. People fuck around on the bridge all the time. It just makes sense that someone would fall. Yeah, but... What if he didn't fall? Oh, my God. You think he jumped? I don't know. Maybe. It means you're right. It's not weird I guess, right? Why do you care so much? God. Wow, I sound like such a dick. Don't I? Why do you care so much a kid in our class is dead? And that kid Daryl's still missing. I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep bringing it up either. It's just... I don't really feel like I have anyone to talk to right now. It's my fault, isn't it? Um, what?

Charlie... uh, Carol Barth. Her number. Uh, yeah. Okay, just one second. [WHISPERS] Asshole. - [TELEPHONE RINGING] - [WHISTLING TUNEFULLY] [CHARLIE] Fuck. Fuck. Barth residence. Charlie, it's Zach. How did you get my number? Don't worry about that now, all right? Just listen. I think it's Josh. You think what's Josh? I think he killed John Whitcomb. What the hell, Zach? No, I need to talk to somebody who knows and you're the only one who does. So just like fucking let me work this out, all right? - What? - Okay. So fuckin' Daryl gags at a bit of fuckin' Josh's weed, and he loses his shit. But then the other night, all of a sudden, Josh just like gives it all away to some girl as a gift. But then he says he's gonna sell some to John Whitcomb. - So? - So, like a fucking week ago, Josh is talking about how much he fucking hates John Whitcomb, and all of a sudden he's gonna sell him weed? And then all of a sudden John Whitcomb turns up dead at the exact same fucking spot where we were all hanging out? I mean, it's just a little too fucking coincidental, don't you think? All right, so he's acting weird. So are you. So am I, probably. I know. But I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided to go out where Daryl is, and it's fucking different. Wait, wait, wait... You're saying you went back out there? - What the... - The sword is gone. Someone took it. I looked, I checked. It's not fucking there. Someone has taken the sword. Why would you go back up to the woods? You know that three people know about that sword, right? You, me, and Josh. And I don't think he went out there alone. - No. - No. I think Josh did. I think he went there, he took the sword, he fucked with Daryl's body, and then he went and pushed John Whitcomb off the fucking bridge. And now I have no idea where he is, 'cause he won't answer any of my fucking phone calls. It's so fucked up. I know, man. Why would you add all this extra nonsense onto the situation? Isn't it bad enough as it is? You are not listening, Charlie. Daryl is dead. Charlie, Charlie. Listen, all right? Josh, or fucking somebody else, they went up there, and if they found Daryl alive, they fucking finished him off. And if they didn't and they found him dead, well, then they were just fucking hacking at his dead fucking body. What, so it was Josh? He's your friend, isn't he? Of course he is. Then why go out of your way to put this on him? Is this not concerning? I mean, where is the fucking sword? - Do you have it? - No. Did you take it? How do we know you didn't take it? How do we know if it's even gone? You wanna take me back out there and show me? Lure me back out there? No thank you. Charlie, you need to listen. No, I don't. You need to listen to yourself. You're fucking losing it, dude. Don't call me again. Ah, shit! I didn't want you to see this, Mama. [TV PLAYS INDISTINCTLY] [DOOR OPENING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Look who I found. Yo. Hey. I got chicken. I already ate. You told me to eat whatever. - Oh, I did? - Yeah. Oh. Well, then we'll reheat. Josh, you want some chicken? I'm fine. I shouldn't stay long. - Do you wanna... - Yeah. We're gonna be outside for a sec. - Don't go far. - I won't. So what are you doing here? I don't know, dude. Just hanging out. I'm sorry I ditched you at Allison's. Yeah, she was pretty bummed. What? What are you doing? Are you like afraid of me now? No, I'm not afraid of you. There's just some... Josh, I went off to the woods again. - What? - Yeah, and I saw that someone took the sword. Did you talk to Charlie? Obviously I fucking talked to Charlie. Okay, why are you yelling at me? I'm not... I wasn't yelling at you. - Yes, you were. - I wasn't yelling. Look... Okay, Josh, this is... Look, we need to be talking. Like really talking. Not like you showing up at my house sometimes and bumping into each other at a fucking party, like... We're friends. And I need my friend back, you know. Because we're in this shit together. Whose number is that? Josh, I'm willing to draw a line. Really. I'm willing to fucking put everything, like what happened with Daryl, and what maybe happened with John Whitcomb... What are you talking about what happened with John Whitcomb? Lower your voice. My mom is inside, all right? Look, I... We... We can forget about all that stuff and... Look, I know how you feel. No, you fucking don't know how I feel, okay? All you fucking do is say a bunch of shit that you think sounds nice, because you're scared all the time. Well, you're wrong. And you're wrong about me too. He left? Wish you would have told me. I could have driven him. No, he can take care of himself. They found that Whitcomb boy. Daryl's still missing. It's just too much. I keep thinking if I was their mother...
