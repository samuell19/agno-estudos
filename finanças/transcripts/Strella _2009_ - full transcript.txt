I was raised by my grandmother..... my mother's mother My father never lived in our home Whenever he came home, he was always drunk He just came to eat, sleep and then leave in the morning Where is he now ? I wish I knew.... He's probably in prison When I was nine years old, he killed my uncle The brother of my mother A very handsome lad, he was only 17 y.o. He was sentenced for many years in prison Do you want me to tell you how it happened ? I had just come home from school and I was all alone.... ...and then my uncle came home My uncle adored me. I was his favoured. We started playing and fooling around... Nothing serious. Children stuff... We took our clothes off and started rubbing each other And then suddenly my father came in....Bad luck ! He saw us...... and he freaked out Then he started hitting my uncle Was hitting him hard. Then he took an iron bar and smashed the boy's head. As I was running to escape, he also hit me in the leg It was like a horror movie. Havoc ! Blood everywhere He then picked me up and took me to the hospital to be examined He left me there and went to surrender himself During his trial, he never said the real reason for the murder Allegedly he wanted to save me from village gossip. Nonsense ! They sentenced him many years in prison I never saw him again When my granny died, I left the village the very same day I was 14 y.o. when I came to Athens Yorgos ? Yorgos ? Yes ? - Why are you crying girlfriend ? - My mother died..... Two days ago, but they found her only today, thanks to the baby crying loud - Drugs, right ? - Yes.... What are you going to do now ?

Fuck, I'm going crazy !! - Are you laughing ? - What else can I do Yorgos ? - I'm leaving now.... - Again....? I was walking around all night. I am losing my mind ! Have you realized what we did, the two of us ? Damn it ! When granny died, I thought I should find you and tell you everything And then I postponed it because...... It's only Alex... he won't stay long I am not well.... Have a seat ! Hey Yorgos. How are you ? - Did Strella tell you the news ? - I haven't said anything My mother died. She was in a bad shape lately I was always telling myself, I must visit her, I must visit her ! And finally, me being a true cunt, I never managed to go to her ! I left her alone, just like that... You should ask yourself who left whom ? Come on now ! There is a baby involved Strella. What will happen to the baby ? They will put the baby in a State home or will give her to my crazy aunt What's all this stuff in your travel bag ? My clothes for the funeral. The brother of Costas gave them to me. What should I wear ? Man's clothes I suppose, right ? Obviously ! I'll wear my sneakers, trousers and ..... ....the tight shirt that we snatched from Zara's... remember ? Say, do you have an extra bag ? I want to put all our things in there. I will give it back to you when I come back It's in my room, under the wardrobe. You know where it is. Yes..... Thank you ! His mother was a whore too and a junkie all the way. -I should be leaving now - Wait, I want to talk to you Strella dear ...... I'll take this bag.... or is it too loud faggoty ? I'll take my jockeyhat too. I had lent it to you a few days ago, remember ? I want to hide my hair inside the hat OK I'm leaving now...

I was waiting for you all these years So, when you got out, I thought I'd follow you, just to see you - Believe me ! - What are you talking about ? I was waiting outside the prison since dawn I followed you on foot, then took a taxi and followed your bus Afterwards, I got a room at your hotel and I was waiting for you there.... I couldn't sleep all night. I was thinking and waiting.... In the morning I heard your door.... I got out and asked for a light... < Do you have a light ? > I had nothing to lose I'd see you and it would all end there Then I thought I'd wait a bit longer just to see you again But then I lost control.... I let myself go with the flow... You see, I am like that... Blame it on my life style.... For me you were just another stranger and I liked you..... - And you had to fuck me ? - One thing led to another.... -I wanted you as much as you wanted me -What are you saying ? - You came onto me first... - But I didn't know !! - I doesn't make any difference -Like hell is does !
