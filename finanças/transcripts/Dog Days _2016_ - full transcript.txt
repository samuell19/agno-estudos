Hey. That guy... Was that your husband? Bye-bye. Take a seat. When are you going to get a real air conditioner in here? You don't like it? Find another job if you don't like it. Eat something. You're as thin as a cherry stem. You... So, what does he do? Your boyfriend. He's got his own business. Does he make good money? We get by. I saw you with a kid the other day. You have a son? A kid deserves a better life than their parents. Need a ride? I got a Honda. That's all right. Have you seen Longlong? Lu Lu. Hey, gorgeous. - Gorgeous. - Lu Lu. Pretending like you don't know me? Longlong. Longlong. Longlong. Longlong! Sorry, the subscriber you called does not answer. Come on. Drink up. Who? Fan Bingbing? Li Bingbing? Fatty Teacher, have you put on weight? Underneath the fat, there's a little bit of muscle. - Hand me your phone. - Don't you have one? I can't reach him. What's in it for me? Hello? One kiss per call. I'm just teasing you. Call as much as you want. He's out so late with our son. I want you to know that I think you're the sexiest girl in town. You want to know where he went? Are you sure? Shanghai at night, Shanghai at night You are a city that never sleeps Pretty lights ignite, the music sounds Song and dance in peaceful harmony Her welcoming smile is all one sees Who could have known her inner anguish? Her life at night is all for The necessities of life When wine no longer intoxicates It's easy to indulge Under an ominous sky, a troubling place Where people squander youth Daybreak comes People go home with bleary eyes Their souls return With the turning of tires and wheels For a moment, she finds a new world A land beneath heaven But her life at night will return Have you seen him? As one awakens from a dream Up next, our final performer of the night. Please give him a big hand. Yes! Thanks, everyone. Have you seen him? No. The wind is blowing tonight Is he around? I miss your great gentleness - Who? - Ask Sunny. My life with you is so much easier My love is not subtle Because I miss you strongly Why do I dream about you all the time? I'm not lonely Where is he? On the way of love You treat me so nice Bottoms up. And this time is really different Where is he? Maybe I should... Get lost. Possess you well Do you hear me? Where is he? Just like you always support me My dear Answer me! My intimate lover Don't go. Thank you for being with me Back off. I'm running a business here. Where is he? My intimate lover Stop. You're ruining my business. You're causing a ruckus. You're clueless. Let go of me. Tell me where he went! Where are you? I booked a hotel. With what money? Money that's gonna take you out to a nice meal. Hello? I mean it. A nice meal? Okay. You've seen him, haven't you? He's not here. Have you tried calling him? Of course I've tried! He hung up on me. I can't even get into my own house. Maybe he's at another bar. With our child? How much money does he blow here? Usually a beer or two. Where is he? I'm not stupid. Sunny. Go away. "Go away"? I'll skin you and feed you to my dog! You're on in ten! Hurry up! Don't look at me like that. He's not like you. Don't look at me! What am I gonna do? I just... I just want him to tell me the truth. The truth? Yes. The real truth. And you'll let him go? I don't want him back. I don't believe you. You have to! If he gives me back my son, I'll let you go. You'll both be free. Do you mean it? Yes, I mean it. So, you must help me. You must help me find my son. Will you stay away? Can you let me talk to him alone? Answer me. Who's there? You're home at this hour? Come in. HAPPINESS Take a seat. Hi. I'm Lu Lu. Hello, Lu Lu. Have a seat. Here. How old are you? Have you ever seen him? No. Cheers. That's all you're taking? Lu Lu. Lu Lu. Here. Take care of him. Keys. ABIDE BY THE LAW How old are you? I'm pretty young. Do you know how old Bai Long is? He never told me. He's 32. Do you know how Bai Long and I met? I was out drinking with friends. He sat down next to me. I looked at him and thought, "He's quite handsome." But he didn't talk to me. I thought I'd never see him again. The next day, he showed up at the restaurant where I worked, just sat there without saying a word. He didn't want to eat or anything. I ignored him. He came back the next day. He asked if I wanted to eat. I didn't have an excuse, so I went. Then, he came to pick me up from work everyday. About a month later, he moved into my place. We've been together for a bit more than two years. So, how old are you? I'm 20. Where's my son? Where is he? What's wrong with you? How could you run off with my son? What's wrong with you? Don't cry, baby. Mommy is here. Mommy is here. VACANT Would you turn on the AC? That's extra. Are you kidding? We're looking for someone. All right. Just a moment. - Name? - Bai Long. "Bai Long". Nobody with that name. He's on the third floor. If he registered, he'd be in our system. Excuse me, sir. So, what now? What now? He said he's here. He isn't registered here, which means he's not here. He has a double bed. This is not about a double bed or single bed. He hasn't checked in, so I can't find him. Understand? I suggest you look somewhere else. Okay? You little liar. I'm not lying. You should be thanking me. - If it wasn't for me... - If it wasn't for you? Sir, miss, please step outside to argue. What's in it for you? Nothing. Liar. You think you know me? Do you know what I've been through? You don't know shit. Fuck off. I want a room. There is no room. There's not a single room in this dump? This dump is fully booked. Only one room, but it's not cleaned yet. Okay. Hey, sir. You need to register. Hey! Hello? Where the hell are you? You tell me what's wrong! I'm by the lobby. Hello? Anyone there? Hello? - Yes? - It won't open. Hello? When are you going to fix the goddamn AC? I'm so tired. - You want to smoke? - I do. I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you earlier. I was afraid you'd get angry. You couldn't stand it, so you ran out on her? Have you seen the guy I'm with? Do you realize how rude you and your friend are? I'm sorry. I apologize for my friend. I'm sorry for being rude. He went upstairs. You gave him a key? He went up with a guy. I know. What do you know? Get out. Did you hear me? Where can I go? Get out. Get up. Get going. How could you treat me like this? Why would you do this? You're sick! Where is he? Where is he? I gave him away. Aren't you fed up of taking care of him? That's a lie. I never said that. That's not what I meant. I want to see him. Now. Or I'll call the police. I told them you were dead. Look at me. I'm dead. That's what you want? Do you remember how you treated me? All those nights you came home late. You said you went out for drinks with friends. I believed you. I believed everything. Then, one night, the whole night you were gone. I found you asleep in the hallway in the morning. You said you lost your keys. There was a horrible smell on you. I asked you what it was. You said it was sweat. What kind of doctor is he? A physician. I wouldn't let just anybody raise my kid. Seventeen. Lie down, please. Lift up your shirt. Look at you. You look like an animal on the street. Where's my son? I want to see him. Let's go. Hey, guy. What's with you? Hurry up. Just get up. Come on. Get up. Where're you going? It's this way. Let's go. Don't ignore me. Hello? Okay. I'll be there soon. - Where is he? - At the hospital. Lu Lu. Lu Lu. I died. That's what he told them. Why don't you call the police? Why are you still here? I want to see what kind of place my son would grow up in. I'm taking a shower. You'd like to watch? We've examined the baby. There's nothing serious. You weren't married, correct? Here's what we owe you. Don't come around again. Longlong. Pack your things. Come with me. I'll take you for that nice meal. With what money? Sunny, help me with this. Okay. You can go. Just go! Got a cigarette? There. What's wrong? The truth is... The truth is Longlong and I spoke about giving the child away. I said it in anger. I didn't mean it. Who's there? What is it? Does he have a scar on his back? Stop it! Open the door! - Open it. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Open the door. I'll call the police. I already am! I'm calling the police. I had a son. Then what should we do? I don't think we can keep this child. Because it will mean an endless amount of trouble for us. All right. Goodbye. Sit down. What do you plan to do? Is Bai Long the father? Will you raise the child on your own? What if... What if I leave my child to you? What do you mean? I believe this child deserves a better life than us. You should take him back. A child should be with their real mother. Hello? Sorry, the subscriber you called does not answer. Take him. I cannot accept this child. Take the child. I'll help you. Take this child.
