I wouldn't do that if I were you. Wouldn't you? Thanks for the advice but how do I know she ain't going to jump? She's alright, she's not going to do anything. Just going to stand there, she's going to walk up and down and.. Then she's going to lean against that bollard... and just stand there and look out to sea. She ain't got no right to be out there without a pass. Brother, she'll have a pass, she'll have a pass to the White House if she wanted. You start pushing around, it only get yourself into trouble, she's a somebody. Speaking of passes, where's yours? Oh, you're new here, aren't you? Ship's master, eh? I came ashore on a dinghy. Tied up down there at the end of the pier. There, you see. - Told you she was alright. - What's she going to do now? Just look, she's watching for a ship to come in. Only it's sitting at the bottom of the Atlantic. - What ship is that? - Used to be called the Fortuna. Oh yeah, that gambling ship, she used to be sitting right here at this dock. That's right. - You know, I was old pier 27. - Yeah, I know, I know. Was owned by a boss gambler called Joe the Greek, ever hear of him? Oh sure I did, everybody read the newspapers then, did you know him? Yeap, I was master of the Fortuna. Say tell me, was he, was he really a Greek? Nobody ever knew what he was, except tough. And brother you got to understand he wasn't just ordinary tough, he was double tough. And too smart for his own good. - Crossed you up, eh? - Oh no. - Crossed himself up. - How? That's how. Right here on this pier, the last time she ever saw him. When was that? Back a ways when we had the Fortuna tied up here. We weren't operating then, were broke and full of trouble. One day Joe come breezing in with his face... full of fine and dandy and his heart full of ice water. You see, we'd been driven off the west coast by the law... and put in here to raise a bank roll so we could operate in Havana. Joe was kind of up against it. There was a Greek sailor on board, guy by the name Bascopolous.. How is Bascopolous? Looks like he's going to join Barnum and Bailey Joe. What did the Doc say? Well, according to the Doc, he's already gone. Said he wouldn't last over an hour two hours ago, all gone inside. - How it go uptown today? - Swell thanks, Swede. I got the plaster taken off the boat, we can sail anytime. Good, you know those mugs of yours is been getting kind of restless. I am. - Let me know when he goes. - Right. - Hey Blubber, fix this thing. - Something wrong boss? It paid. They ain't no customers Joe. There's going to be customers where we're going, fix it. Ok. Hello boys. Well, I got it. Cost me ten grand but it was worth it. Look at that, signed by his honor the superior court judge... took seven lawyers to write it and Joe to do the fixing., put it in the safe Zepp. Boys we're sailing for Havana as soon as Bascopolous kicks off. Forget it Joe, this ship ain't going no where. - Who says so? - Your uncle Sam. - What is this a rib? - Yeah, take a gander at those kites. J. Bascopolous, G. Zepp, J. Adams... 1A, they can't do this to me, I'm a civilian. That's what you think. Take a look at mine, I got the same thing, 1A. They don't even give you time to cut off a leg. - How you'd use your way out of the army? - You don't. Listen, this is ain't my war, I had my war. Calling out of the gutter, the hard way. - I won that war. - Yeah. Well, looks like you're going to help win this one. Go on, I don't recognize any other war. It's Ok chief. Don't worry. I got it all fixed Joe, we can hop a plane out of here for Mexico City in two hours. What? Yeah and from there we can catch a plane for Rio. You can work South America until the soldier business blows over. Yeah, take it easy Crunk. It's a lot of guys with big dough down there Joe. Yeah, well relax. Thanks Crunk. Look, you think I'm going to give up the boat on account of this card? - None of you other guys got one, eh? - That's what you get for using you own name. Change it once a month the way we do. Who says it's my own name? J. Bascopolous. What did he get? 4F. - What's that? - It means they don't want him. He's physically unfit. The lucky stiff. He's physically unfit alright. How old is he? Alright boys, get lost. Whatever is on the army Joe. - Who did tell you in? - Why, we're partners, ain't we? - That's a 50-50 proposition in my book. - What do you want? Half the card? I'll trade you my half of the boat for the card Joe. What good would a boat do me in the army? The one who gets the card gets the boat along with it. Who gets it Joe? - Want a cut for it? - Poker dice. - You got a deal. - I'll get the box. Wait a minute. - Can't you wait and make the thing legal? - What's wrong with poker dice? Not a thing, only the guy ain't dead yet. I never take anything off a pal in my life. After he joins the circus that's different. - Come on. - Nervous. Take your best shot Zepp. Three kings Joe. Have a smoke Crunk. Four kings Joe, in two rolls. Beat it. Can you hold it a minute chief. Shoot. Three aces. What did you think this was? Amateur night? I don't get you Joe. Didn't you see an elephant walk across the table with muddy feet. - I didn't pull a switch on you Joe. - Didn't you? Then blow on it for luck, go on, blow. - I wouldn't shuffle on my own partner. - Sure you wouldn't. - One more ace, that's it. - Yeah. That's it. There it is. Well, looks like the army needs men like you Zepp. Take good care of yourself. I'll have a nice big service... flag with a single star on it hanging in my office, just for you. - Swede, see you later. - Where you going Joe? - Uptown raise a bank roll so we can sail. - I thought you've lifted the plaster. Sure, but that took everything we had, we need 50 grand before we can start operating. Where you going to get it? Oh, I can raise that kind of wind in one afternoon. Oh Swede, shake hands with the new Joe Bascopolous. Here that Swede, Take this dough and give Joe Adams in there... a swell funeral, lots of nice white flowers. I always thought the guy had a lot of good in him. What's he talking about? You explain it to him Crunk, while I get a fast time changing my outfit. - Well, I guess that's enough of that. - Yeah. You anxious to get in the service? - You don't know what it cost me Doc. - That's too bad. Your blood pressures 210, we can't use you. Ah, you can't use... I said we can't use you. I'm sorry. - Will it hurt if I get drunk? - Well, it won't do you any good. Then I'm going to get drunk and I'm going to stay drunk. Too bad, a fine, patriotic fellow, it's been a shock to him. - Hey come on, throw that thing away. - Did you raise the wind? Raise the wind? I couldn't even raise a good cough. - I don't know what happened to this town. - How about all those soft touches you knew? Well, the heat is on, they either got caught in the draft... or went square, paid their income taxes, income taxes? - How you going to raise the dough Joe? - How do I know? I tried every guy I ever knew, looks like our luck is out. - Boss. - Don't do that. But look. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 naturals. This is strictly from heaven, this going to change your luck. Come on, what are we waiting for? Let's do it. - You do it, I'll wait here. - What? You know it's no good if we both don't do it. What's the matter with you? You're crazy? If I were jinxed or something. This is a sure thing, can't miss. Sit down boss. - Ok Joe. - Fine. Take it easy bud. Come on, the fellow is getting nervous. Thanks pal. How do you do? How do you do? Can I sell you a ticket to our charity ball? - Sure. - One or two? Two. They're 50 dollars a piece. Oh, I know they're frightfully expensive, but we're trying to raise 100,000 dollars. Are you now. - That's a coincidence. - What is for sister? War Relief Incorporated. I'm interested in relief. - Where are your headquarters? - The address is on the ticket. Thanks, I'll look you up. I may throw something your way. Thank you. - Where can I find the big boss? - I'm sorry, they're all very busy just now. I want to make a donation. What kind of donation do you want to make? Seventy or eighty thousand dollars. Just wait. Our captain Steadman would like to see you mister... Just a moment Mrs. Ostrander. Did you say 70 or 700 dollars? - $70,000. - I told you. This way please. Captain Steadman, this is mister... - I don't believe I got your name. - Joe, how are you? - Joe? - Joe. Oh Joseph, don't you understand Mister Joe. Do sit down. Close the door as you go out please. You wonderful man, you couldn't have come at a more timely moment. You know the sales of tickets for our bazaar have been so disappointing. You know, we have to send a whole ship load of medical supplies to Europe. It's frightfully expensive and we have to raise the money as quickly as possible. I do hope you want to make your donation in cash. - I always do business in cash. - Oh, that's splendid. - You'll have to help me though. - Oh, of course. You see, I'm a boss gambler, that's my business. Oh we never inquire into one's associations. Now this charity affair of yours, that's made to order. All you have to do is give me the gambling concession. - Gambling? - Sure, black jack Chuck-a-luck, roulette. I'll raise the dough for you in one evening. - I don't understand. - Well, it's simple. You're giving a ball, we take rooms next to it. You steer customers in... I supply the dealers, the tables, the layout. All you have to do is sit back and rake in the winnings. But are there always winnings? Supposing you lose? I always do. - Last winter in Palm Beach I... - Sure that's my point. I bet you dumped a packet, didn't you? Well, look... I'll show you what I mean, you roll the dice, you're the customer. - Shall I? - Sure, go on, roll them. Snake eyes. Now watch the difference. Seven, see the difference? I'm lucky, I can't lose. Now roll them again, you still the customer. - Try a dump shot. - Dump shot? That's right, put them in the glass, rattle them about. See 4. Tough point to make, now watch this. - Seven. - How do you do it? Influence. You bring me the right people, I'll get you that 100,000. - But it's gambling. - Not the way I do it. Look, how much you figure to raise on this ball? - Oh, between 15 and 20 thousand. - Yeah, but you need 100 grand. Now you string along with me and in one night you're home James. But you won't get it listening to that woodpecker. It so happens that gambling is against the law in this country. What's the matter with Reno? Out there it's as legal as selling groceries. Well, it so happens we're in New York. So we are. Oh Dorothy, this is Mr. Joseph. - My lieutenant Miss Bryant. - I already had the pleasure. It so happens Mr. Joseph, that we have a committee of financial advisers. Strange they never hit upon your plan if it's so sound. Well, not everyone can do it lieutenant, it's kind of... - Dangerous, that's what I mean. - I'm afraid Miss Bryant is right. Perhaps if you send us a letter explaining your plan in detail. Yes and we'll be glad to take it up at our next meeting. You're in a hurry for this dough, you can't afford to wait for meetings. Oh, we can't afford to sponsor something we might later regret. Goodbye Mr. Joseph and thank you. Look out, don't let it get in your blood captain, it's bad. Excuse me. Dorothy, don't forget your appointment at the bank. Alright. Mother, mother come here, what bank is that? - Why, it's at 31 East 39th. - Thanks toots. - Where to boss? - The bank. Oh, no. Next. - Good afternoon. - Hello Miss Bryant, this is your third visit, isn't it? Yes. We'll have your silver button waiting for you as soon as you're through. - Thank you. - Sit right over there please. Well? Hello. - Next please. - That's you chum. Everybody move up please. Move up one, thanks bud. Well, well. This is quite a surprise. No particularly, it so happens I rather expected it. And if you think your persistence is going to have any effect on me, you're mistaken. Well, I can't see how you people can pass up 80,000 dollars for the cause. For whose cause? If you're so interested in serving a cause, why don't you join the army? Next. - 4F. - You look 1A to me. You don't look so bad yourself. - Oh, it's my arteries. - Right this way please. Oh, should you be giving blood? My blood is 1A, just my arteries are 4F. J. Bas... - Bascopolous... - I thought you said your name was Joseph? Well, if a fellow went around calling himself Bascopolous... think what the other people would call him. Look... Why didn't you let me finish what I was trying to tell the captain? It so happens I don't trust your motives. Yeah, here I am giving my life's blood and she don't trust my motives. The person who gets your life blood... will probably develop a sudden passion for the dump shot. And the poor soldier that gets your blood, they can use him for an ice cube. - Next please. - Well, it so happens... Wait a minute, what is that so happens routine? - It so happens that's a phrase I use. - Well, it so happens, I'm offering you ei... - Goodbye and the answer is still no. - This isn't the way out. Don't bother me. But you can't go now, you got to rest for 20 minutes. Look sister, take a walk, I feel like a million dollars. - But you must lie down and rest. - I feel great. - Hi you boss. - How was it Crunk? Wonderful. They only took a pint, I'm coming back tomorrow and give em a gallon. - This thing is a... - You see? What did I tell you? - What you say Crunk. - I thought we had rat guards on this boat. How you get on? - Joe up? - What you doing back? I'll do my talking to Joe, if you don't mind. From Athens, heroic Greek troops were tonight defending the mountain... passes of Northern Greece against invading German and Italian forces. Hey boss, 1A is back. I can't hear you, turn that thing off. Heavy fighting is reported in the Vardar Valley where... What's doing Joe? How come you're not in uniform? Got a couple of weeks before I go to camp. Ain't got any place to flop. - Ok if I stay on the boat? - Yeah, why not. Thanks, how you coming with the bank roll? I got a crack at the biggest bank roll in New York, if ti works. What's holding it up? - An iceberg, but I'll melt her down. - Yeah. Ok, if I get something to eat? Sure, go down the galley, see what they got. Thanks Joe. Thanks a lot. Boss, when you clean out a guy like Zepp, you hadn't ought to keep him around. - Is that any way to treat a soldier? - But I'm telling you chief. Crunk... never give a sucker an even break and always keep an eye on a pal. Remember that. Hey, where can I get a car? I got to put off the dock for a few days. I know a fella in town is got a sedan. Yeah, well get it and meet me on the dock in half an hour. Ok chief. - So long Crunk. - Joe? So we'll just have to sell some more tickets darling, I wish we knew how. Even we sell the whole lot wouldn't be half enough. Yes? Miss Bryant, there's a recruiter out here in the office. - I don't know what to do about it. - Well, hang on to her, we can use anybody. But Miss Bryant, it's rather a special case. Well, send her in before she changes her mind. You see her dear, I got a hundred things to do. She may have scores of money and will buy a box of tickets. I'm her. I've been thinking over what you said yesterday. And I was wondering why you couldn't use me in this set up. You mean, you want to enlist in this organization? Time for every man to do his bit. - If wasn't for this weak heart I'd... - Arteries. Arteries, same thing, how about it? What about all this gambling at the ball business? Oh I forgot it too bad, great idea. Yeap, good for the cause. Well, let it go. Well, as personnel officer I have no right to refuse any enlistment. However, I think I should warn you. We've had a few men before, but they all asked to be transfer to more active branches. So many women around get on their nerves. - Oh, that won't bother me. - I might've known. Perhaps you better read this first, we expect a lot of our workers. Thank you, you mind if I sit down please ma'am? Oh, of course not. How you do? I gather from what's going on, you want to enlist. - Yes ma'am. - You sure you know what you're doing? I'd do anything to help the cause, anything. I think that's wonderful, don't you Dorothy? We do need a man in this office, you said so yourself yesterday. - Why waste time looking around? - Why indeed. You sure you know what you're doing? - Definitely. - Perhaps you're right. The discipline will be good for him too. Now you fill in the application, I'll go get you a button. - Thank you. - Sign on the bottom line Mr. Basco-pollus. Bascopolous, I didn't think you'd forget me. I don't intend to. - Like it? - Like it? I'm fascinated. There you are. Now you're one of us Mister... - Bascopolous. - Oh yes, of course. - Bascopolous? Greek? - American, naturalized. Oh yes. Well, now you get to us... Dorothy will take good care of you. And you come and see me when you have a moment to... - spare and tell me how you're getting on. - Yes. Greek, how wonderful. - Everything is fixed, I'm in. - Stand up. Take your hat off my desk, put out that cigarette. Recruits are not allowed to smoke during office hours. And put a fresh bottle of water on that cooler please. Yes. How would you like to begin with a propaganda project? Yes sir or madam. - Do you know how to knit? - Knit? I asked you if you knew how to knit. Knit? In England men who are incapacitated knit without hesitation. Knit? Why the best knitter I ever saw was wing commander Barnstable. He picked it up while he was in a plaster cast. I don't knit. That's exactly the attitude we're trying to combat. Now look here, I don't mind... We want a group of obviously masculine men to take up knitting. - Do it perfectly casually in public places. - You think I'm strong enough? I'm quite certain. Half the women who were knitting for us last year are... now learning to drive ambulances and run buses. Do I get to trim a hat? You don't seem to have caught the idea... of the organization you just joined Mr. Bascopolous. We're people who won't be able to get in to the actual fighting. We resent that fact. So we take our resentment out in doing our best to help when and how we can. Well, I'm not backing out, I can't knit because I don't know how, that settles it. Report to Mrs. Van Every, she's our best instructor. Or do I tear this up? - Ok, knit. - And take your hat. Ok, hat. Now you sit down with the rest of the girls and I'll be glad to show you. Now, let me look at your hands. Yes they're really clever hands, have you should've no trouble at all. Now the first thing you do is learn how to hold the needles. And you hold the knitting in this left hand so. Yes. And now, here you take the needle. We learn to keep those little piggies... Now you take the needle and stick it so into the stitch, you see? And then make a loop and throw the yarn over and bring it through... come, come, come, come. And here, now you try one, you see. Now, you hold the needle in this hand. Yes. Now you see how simple it is. Down... Now I'm going to show you how to rib. You knit one, just as you've been doing... and then you purl one. Now this is a purl, not the kind you pass before swine. But ♪- U - R - I. Now look here. You bring your needle so from the back to the front... That's a boy, yes and throw the yarn over in front instead of in back. That's the difference between a purl and a knit. There you did it, bless his heart. Now pick it up, there you have it. Now you see... It's knitting one, purl one. Knit one, purl one... Be calm, be patient, be exact. Hey, can you help me, I dropped me purl. I'm beginning to like it. You're a pioneer and pioneers are always know for their great moral bravery. - Sure, moral brav... - Boss, people are watching. - So what? - What do you want them to think? Will you look out, I almost dropped a stitch. - Ah, for Pete's sake. - Oh, pipe down. Mrs. Van Every, this is the Crunk, my driver. - How do you do Mr. Crunk? - Take off your hat. Take that cigarette out of your mouth, sit down. - Give him the needles. - Don't be alarmed, young man. Let me look at your hands. Go on, show your coach your hands, where's your moral bravery? Let me see, yes. They look as though they'd be quite skillful for the picking up things. Now the first thing you do is learn how to hold the needles. - You hold this in this hand... - Joe. And then you hold the other needle so... You take the one gimmick in here... stick it in here like this and then you take the string and... put it between the two gimmicks, then you take it and you just, haul it off. - That's all there is to it. - Hey Crunk... The thing kind of gets you. - Did you show them how to purl? - I haven't gotten to that yet boss. You know Joe... you shouldn't had to leave me at that knitting table with all those wacky wrens. Well, I had to, I wanted to talk to the head of the joint while that dame was out the way. How you do? I think we're in, she's going to tell her where to get out tomorrow. Hey, get to bed, we got an early call in the morning. How you making out on with that iceberg Joe? You thaw her out yet? I got a better idea, I'm working my way around her, good night. Good night. Now listen lady, you accepted my blankets and you didn't say nothing about the cost. I'm losing money on these as it is. Say, what kind of people are you? Trying to get the best of me after you made a deal. Not the understanding we had at all. I I'm only a house wrecker lady trying to get along. Now, I never would've tore down that hotel except on account of them blankets. Please don't shout so. - Oh, good morning. - Good morning. - What seems to be the trouble? - Well... She owes me 2400 bucks, that's the trouble. He's trying to charge us 6 dollars a piece for these second hand blankets. I could've got 10 bucks. Millions of refugees shivering in tents and this creature tries to hold us up. You ought to be ashamed of yourself raising your... price just because blankets are hard to get. That's the old law of supply and demand lady and it ain't been repealed yet. - Six bucks a piece, where's my check? - I tell you we haven't it in our account. Yeap, well, let's not be too hasty. Don't you think we ought to examine the blankets? Oh, would you mind holding my knitting please, thank you. Oh yeah, pretty good stuff. I think that's a good six dollar value. But we haven't got it. - Oh, well that's the trouble mister... - McDougal. They haven't got it. But look, you look like a pretty good sport. I tell you what I'll do, I'll flip you. Ah, 12 dollars or 4. Oh, but we couldn't possibly afford 12 dollars. Oh, don't worry. If I lose, I'll pay for them with my own kick. I wouldn't want to have those shivering refugees on my conscience. What do you say Mr. McDougal? 12 or 4? You're on, heads. Oh, I'm sorry, I can't do it with that coin, you see it's got tails on each side. I got it from a gambler, I wouldn't want to gyp you. See, you'd have lost. - Now, what do you say we do that old? - Behind the back? - Yeah sure, go on. - Alright how, you ready? - I'm ready. - Alright alright. Well, look at that, we got the blankets for 4 dollars... now you got that much in the bank, ain't you? Now wait a minute, you got to give me another chance to break even, double or nothing. Oh, no. I don't think I could do that Mr. McDougal. No, that wouldn't be right, it... Some of the mean guys in here don't like gambling. - Well, alright, we ready. - I'm ready. Double or nothing? You know, that's a funny thing, that wouldn't happen again in a thousand times. Oh, it won't happen again to me. Never mind, you'll sleep well tonight because you did a good deed for a worthy cause. Here. Now, you're one of us. I have contributed to War Relief Incorporated. I have been taken by War Relief Incorporated. What do you mean they won't unload the truck? Well, it so happens they're medical supplies. Serums, they're important to save lives. Well, tell them what I said and if there's anymore trouble, call me back. Come in. I've been trying to think of some way to thank you for getting us the blankets. Well, the percentages were in our favor. The other guy was doing the guessing. Mrs. Steadman was talking to me yesterday... - Oh yeah? - About the gambling. - It's off. - Oh, I get it... - You still don't trust me? - No. And ever since you first came in here, I've been trying to figure out why. Look, what's a guy is supposed to do? Put his heart on a plate before you'll trust him? What do you think you'll get out of this? - I told you, I'm just trying to do my bit. - That doesn't explain anything. Well, I just don't like to talk about it, that's all. - Did you ever hear of the Vardar Valley? - In Greece? Yeah. The name of Bascopolous goes back over 500 years in that section of the country. How do I know what's happened to my brothers or my kid sister. You think I like the idea of those guys walking into my mothers kitchen? I lie awake nights trying to figure out how to help. They turned me down for military service so I do the next best thing. Try to raise dough to get supplies to those poor people, so now you know. I'm terribly sorry. Well, that's alright, don't apologize, I'm sorry I had to tell you, that's all. Oh Mr. Joe Mr. Joe. - You forgot your knitting. - OH yeah, mustn't forget that. I can't thank you enough for what you've done for us. Oh that's alright, I'd do as much to a total stranger. Mr. Bascopolous. I have to go down to the dock. We're having a little trouble about getting some supplies unloaded. - Will you, will you go with me? - Sure. We can use my car. - Break it up, will you. - Look out fella, hey buddy... You call that purling? You dropped a stitch, wait till I tell Mrs. Van Every. - Where to boss? - North River, downtown. - Promise me something Joe. - What? - Never, never knit again please. - Oh, you're asking a lot. - What is that? - Roll of dimes. - Why do you carry it? - Habit, fits nice in your hand. - Where's Mr. Comstock? - He went to use the phone. I'm Miss Bryant, I've come to take care of this trouble. Would you please start unloading this truck as quickly as... possible and I'll straighten it out with Mr. Comstock. Ok miss alright boys. Hey, not so fast, brother. Wait a minute. The next time you touch that stuff without this release in your pocket... you'll find yourself tangled up with the law. I told you relief people it was pay on delivery, that's what it says. But we agreed to give it to you on Saturday. I don't do business that way sister. 1300 bucks, that's what you owe me. Do I get it now or do I take this back to the warehouse. - But we can't pay you until Saturday. - Ok, Saturday will be 10% more. Oh Mr. Comstock, I beg your pardon. - Who's this? - Well, I work for Miss Bryant. And I think you ought to get what you're asking for. Joe. If you've got a pen, I can give you my personal check. How do I know your check is any good? Well, if I can get to a telephone, I can verify it for you. - Telephone up the office. - Thank you. Go ahead. Everything is Ok boys, all signed, start unloading, can grab. Hello, let's get back to the jute mill. You misunderstood Mr. Comstock, nice fella, family man. What happened to your dimes? - I tipped the guy. - Did you have to hit him very hard? What? Me fight? Go on, I'm a peace loving citizen. - Joe. - What? But he might've killed you with that bailing hook. Oh, don't be silly, it's a scratch. Say, you mind if we stop over at the tailor's so I get him to sew my fiddle? - Your what? - My fiddle and flute, my suit. Oh, what kind of double talk is that? Oh, it's a language I picked up in Australia. Like a hat, tit for tat. - Shoes, ones and twos. - Sounds like poetry. Yeah that's the idea, jingles. Like, you're a girl, twist and twirl. - Oh, what are you? - Me, I'm a bloke, that's a heap a coke. Oh, well this twist and twirl is going to take care of the heap of cokes... - Cabbage patch, scratch. - We'll stop at my house, it's on the way. - Anybody home? - No. So the Crunk and me is sitting in this coffee joint. When in comes a pot and pan with his cheese and kisses. - Pot and pan, that's a man. - Yeah. - Cheese and kisses, that's the misses. - Sure. - Well? - Well, the Crunk said to me... Pipe a highs hit me eyes suppose on that guys storm and strife in the Tommy Horner. - Oh, wait a minute, I'm lost. Pipe? - Pipe a highs at, they get your pipe. - Take a look... - Yeah, at the eye suppose. Oh, the nose. Yeah, on that guys storm and strife in the Tommy Horner. - On his wife, in the corner. - Right. Well, what happened? The guy come over and punched the Crunk in the snoot. - Why? - He was from Australia. - Thanks chum, I'll finish it myself. - Yes sir. Bang, bang fella. - Miss Dorothy. - Yes? Shall I telephone for a bottle and stopper? - A what? - A copper, in the American vernacular. Why Foster, don't tell me you've been to Australia? That's where I met me storm and strife Mrs. Foster. Please forgive me Miss Dorothy, but are you aware of the character of this gentleman? - Oh I think so, why? - Do you know he carries a lady from Bristol? - A what? - In American parlance. A rod, if you get what I mean. Don't be alarmed Foster. I think it's part of his character, he carries it for balance. Yes Miss Dorothy. How you coming with the fiddle? How you do that? With a knife and fork? - I never could sew. - You better take a lesson from Van Every. Foster was quite alarmed, he thought I should send for a bottle and stopper. - What for? - The lady from Bristol. Oh that. Well, I wouldn't feel dressed without one. - You ever killed anyone? - No, I'm too good a shot. Hey look, don't get me wrong, I'm a gambler, not a gangster. - Tell me some more. - What? - Some more jingo talk. - Oh that? Now look, if we were going together you'd be my briny marlin. My darling, see. Then I'd be the guy who'd give you that simple Simon for your long and linger. The guy what give me the simple Simon was my mother. And now, bonny fair is your hair. Dots and dies, the I suppose... North and south. Joe. - Take off your mask, you're with friends. - Don't be silly. - Come on briny marlin, don't play games. - I'm not. - Then don't give me those baby blues. - You think I brought you here because... - because... - Didn't you? - Or have you changed your mind? - We seem to be talking in circles. Yeah, it so happens there's a difference of opinion. Suppose we settle it with that game you played with McDougal. What you mean that... Ok, well the... you ready? Alright. Relax, don't get excited. - Which hand. - Neither. - Oh, come on, play fair, you got to guess. - Neither, open them both. Well, looks like you lost. Oh well, when you played it with McDougal you... Yeah, well that was different. Never give a sucker an even break... but don't cheat a friend, I believe in that. I live by it. You don't think I'd play phony with you? Well, you lost. Oh but, I didn't know the rules of the game. Ok, where's my tit for tat? - Joe. - What? Will you run the gambling concession at the ball? - Well, well. Are you sure you can trust me? - Now I know I can. Ok, you got a deal. She laid it right in my lap. She asked me to run the games. We're going to clean up this town and clear for Havana. - How much of a cut do we take? - No cut, we're taking the take. The gamp is on, anything goes. We'll leave them a little chicken feed, make it look legitimate. I'm going to need 5 or 6 grand to get those games rolling in case... we get some hit and run players. Any of you guys got a bank roll stashed away? - Not a thing. - Cigarette money... Why don't you get it from the war relief people? How would it look for the big shot to go around asking those... people, mama, give me a quarter to see the movie show. - Queer the whole thing. - Where you going to get it chief. I'll pick it off a tree. Come on. I beg pardon sir. - Miss Dorothy is just come in sir. - Oh, leave us alone Foster. Yes sir. - Hello you old darling. - Come here Dot. Wait till I powder my eye suppose and comb my bonny fair. Where on earth you pick up such gibberish? From Foster, it's a wonderful slang grandfather, you should talk to him. I've been talking to Foster. What you mean Dot by bringing a gangster into this house? Oh no, don't tell me you're worrying about me grandfather. I'd give you odds against any seven gangsters in the city... but I don't want them coming to my house. What were you doing with the unhappy wretch? Learning things. Grandfather, I think you'd like him. You two have a lot in common. In the name of sweet reason, what? You're both tough. Oh I know, you're tough in a highly moral and civilized way but... fundamentally it's the same thing. It's, it's character. Nonsense, what can you see in a fellow like that? Joe is the first man I ever met I'm afraid of. - It's exciting. - Yeah, but... This fellow hasn't been making advances to you, has he? - Of course, he kissed me. - What? Right on the north and south. I pretended to be angry but truth is I liked it. - Now see here Dot, I will not have this... - Oh, grandfather... - don't worry, I'm quite safe. - Get rid of him child. I will as soon as he's served his purpose, I agree with you. I think he'd be too hard to tame. - Good night grandfather. - Dot, what's his name? The heap a coke, you'll never believe me Joe Bascopolous. - Joe what? - Bascopolous. Now do you wonder why I call him by his first name. Good night, briny marlin. Dorothy, we had the busiest morning. A solid stream of people buying tickets to the ball. The telephones haven't stopped ringing. Well, do you suppose they found out about the gambling? Well, how could they. Mr Bascopolous told me emphatically not to tell anyone. - Well, that's what he told me. - You didn't tell anyone? Well, I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd... - Well, I didn't say, - I'd, I'd, I didn't. I'll get another 500 tickets by noon or I'll get another printer. - Good morning. - Hello genius. Oh, I didn't think you'd ever be late. I've been down town trying to charter a steamship. - What's the matter? - That tit for tat. - Don't you like it? - Like it? I'm fascinated. Oh, Veronica, do we have 6,000 dollars in our checking account? Of course not dear, what for? Well, the war convoy commission is expecting a freighter in Monday. But they won't hold it for us unless we put down a 6,000 dollars deposit today. Oh dear. Well, don't worry about it, I'll send Mr. Hargraves my personal check. I can get it out of the proceeds Friday night. You're a darling. Say, would you like me to take that check downtown for you? You could, look up the Commission. Somewhere on Fulton street. - Hello Angel. - Now see here. What's all this nonsense about gambling at your affair? - Why, where did you hear about it? - Where didn't I hear about it. They're discussing it even on the floor of the exchange. - Oh, that's wonderful. - No, no, stop being frivolous. I know who's back of all this, that scoundrel Bosco, Bosco something or other. - Now Grandfather, you're being absurd. - What? I'll admit I was block headed at first too. But that money is going to send a whole shipload of supplies. Well, find some other way. No, didn't you tell me once that. Great great grandfather Bryant used lotteries... - to raise money for the American Revolution. - That was different, I will not permit it. Alright, then you give us your personal check for 100,000 dollars. Well, I'm not going to bribe you and I'm not going to argue with you. - I'm giving an order. - Oh grandfather, stop being your age. I refuse to have my name associated with that of a, a, a common crook. No remember, I warned you. Now I'm going to act. Get out of here, get your greasy black head out of here. Fair warning. Tickets for the ball? - Hey, who's that old biscuit face? - My grandfather and he isn't a biscuit face. - I don't think he likes me. - Oh, he goes off in a great fizz every now and then but he settles down, don't worry. I'm not worrying. This the check for the freighter? Yes, give it to Mr. Hargraves personally. I want to be sure we get that boat. The War Convoy Commissions form 8B-127/O acknowledging receipt... will be in the afternoons post, goodbye sir. - Are you going to take that check? - I beg your pardon, what you mean? Nothing. Nothing, except there's an ugly story spreading around town. - A story? - Yeah. That you aren't cooperating with the relief organizations. Not cooperating? What on earth do you talking about? I'd like to have your suggestion as to how I can explain why that money... that those ladies need to finance their ball tomorrow night must be given to you today. We had no idea there was any difficulty about the deposit. Well, you see how it looks? And it looks bad. Now the heart of my organization is very much with you people... but there's certain members that think that Greece... - China, Czechoslovakia could use some... - What? But then, perhaps that would put you personally in a very awkward spot. Oh, but my dear sir, I assure you that as far as I'm concerned myself... Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have spoken. But those fine ladies of mine had faith in you Mr. Hargraves. I take it you feel very strongly bout this check. I certainly do. Well, now let's see. Suppose I hold the ship, without a deposit. Oh, I wouldn't want you to break any rules. Oh no, no, no. I'm sure in this case it's perfectly... well I'll write a letter to Miss Bryant to that effect and and return her the check. Oh, I'll save you the trouble. And you don't have to write a letter Mr. Hargraves, your word is good enough for me. - Oh, thanks. - It's a deal. - Right. - Goodbye Mr. Hargraves. Goodbye. - What kind of thing is that? - That? That's a hand knitted tea cozy. Oh, hand knitted eh. Pretty flowers. Nice piece of work. Glad you like it. - Regular needles? - Oh yes, yes. - Mr. Hargraves is out there? - No sir. - Let him have the cash. - Yes Mr. Bryant. How would you like it sir? - Yes Mr. Bryant? - Get me the police department. Yes sir. - Miss Bryant? - Yes. You know where will I find Joe Bascopolous? - He isn't here. - Where's his desk? Out there. Wait, I'm so glad you came. My grandfather sent for you, didn't he? I asked him to, I always thought there was something wrong with Mr. Bascopolous. - What is it? - We want to have a little talk with him. Anything serious? When a guy is been convicted 3 times, carrying a gun is plenty serious. Who's that? That's the man from the water company. I've been expecting him all afternoon. Ask him to come in a minute. Well, inspector, it's about time you showed up. I telephoned the water company several times today. Is this your idea of reliability? 3 bottles and stoppers arrived this afternoon. - With no coolers. - Three bottles and stoppers? Is this the best service your office can give us? I've just about made up my mind to, to take our business elsewhere. Where, for instance? I think the Plaza Fountain place will serve our needs in the future. - Goodbye. - Ok lady. Will you sit down gentlemen, I'm afraid you'll have to wait. - What you doing with that boss? - Looking for a glass. Plaza Fountain, 59th. Got a date with a smart girl. Well, put it there. Why should the cops be trying to pick me up? - Get in. - Why? Grandfather, you will carry a lady from Bristol. They'd pick me up for packing a rod. I'd get sprung in a couple of hours. Come on, get in. What for? I got my own car waiting around the corner. I already told him to go home. Put this on and don't ask questions. Say, we're not only out of town, we're out of state... so is it alright for me to ask questions now please, teacher? I have to talk to grandfather. - Well, he's back... - On the phone. We've passed thousands of good phones. No, this call must come from the right locality, Grandfather is no fool. - How far is the right locality? - Pretty far. - You want me to drive? - You don't mind. - Hold, still a minute. - Hey. There, I've wanted to do that since the first moment I saw you. - What for? - I had this in the car for several days but... I couldn't get up the courage to give it to you. You mind if I show you how to tie it properly? Look. - You hold this end. - Yeah. Keep your eye on the road. Well, how can I look and keep my eye...? - You start tying an ordinary knot. - Yeah. But instead, you go over to the other side... down, then you go all the way around, up... and you finish tying the tie. - They call it a Windsor knot. - Oh they do, eh? Take it easy, just a minute. There, isn't that much better? Kind of big, isn't it? Well, it's better than that stingy little knot you wear. - You like the tie? - Yeah I suppose so. - Well, say thank you. - Alright, thank you. How long has it been since anyone had any control over you? Nobody ever had and nobody ever will. And I'm tying my own knot. - Where do I turn on the lights? - They're not connected. - Is this the old man's place? - Mine. It comes from the other side of the family. The side that was always getting into trouble. - The kind of trouble I'd like to get into. - Lend me your matches Joe. - What's this? - Just a little sitting room. It's alright. This is where I used to entertain my beau. After tea we'd sit in front of the fire and hold hands. Would you light the fire Joe? Operator? Oh, it's alright, this is Miss Bryant. Oh, I'm fine, thank you. I want to talk to my grandfather, in New York. Yes, that's the number, will you ring? For a family that was always getting into trouble, they did alright. Well, it's just that they never seemed to behave the way people expected them to. Look at them, the crazy darlings. Maybe it'll give you some idea of why I don't make sense. - What did he do? - Well, he was a great admirer of the ladies. He was a hunter and maker of 19th century love. - Where he get his dough? - From him. He wrote poetry, privately printed at his own expense. Yeah? Where he get his dough? From him. He wasted his entire life trying to spend the family fortune, it finally killed him. Yeah, where's the guy who made all the dough in the first place? Over here. My great, great grandfather. From log cabin to riches, know how he died? He was shot in a mill at Harpers Ferry. He joined John Brown and his fight to free the slaves. He was a slave owner himself but he listened to a crazy yankee farmer and... caught fire from his words. Oh, the family had quite a time leaving him down. They did, eh? Hello. Oh, well will you call me when you get a line through, it's quite important. Thank you. What you going to use for an argument when you get him? Oh, I'm not going to say much, he's going to do most of the talking. He's going to tell me about your 3 convictions... - and I'm going to tell him I don't care. - What 3 convictions? - Oh, don't pretend Joe, it's alright. - No, no. What do you talking about? I know all about it, the policeman told me today. Go on, I never took a wrap in my life. Please Joe, be honest. Well, alright, I ain't always been on the level... but I've kept my ears clean as far as John Law is concerned. Hello? Grandfather? Now don't get excited, I'm in Maryland. - Maryland. - What you doing in Maryland? You sent those policemen to the office today, didn't you. Did indeed, I'm going to have that blackguard... put behind bars for the rest of his natural life. You know the laws of Maryland, don't you? Well, unless you give me your word of honor the police will be called off... - I'm going to marry him. - What? - Marry him. - But you can't. Oh I can't, can I? I'll give you just 10 seconds to make up your mind. 1, 2, 3... 4, 5, 6, 7... Well, call my bluff then. 8, 9, time is up. Give me your word then, your solemn word. Thank you darling, don't worry. Good night. Well, didn't I tell you to leave it up to me. - Yeah, you were great. - But it worked. Why wouldn't it work? - You had a swell club to smack him with me. - Joe? You think the worst thing that could happens to you is to marry me? To people like you folks like me are animals, we're so bad. And you're so very good. What do you expect, credit for it? How could you be anything else with what you started out with. You ought to be horse whipped if you didn't turn out right. And what are you so high and mighty about? What did you ever do? He's the guy that made all your dough for you and he was born in a log cabin. You know where I grew up? In a one room shack with a dirt floor. You talk about this side of your family and that side of your family, as... far as I know we only had one side and it was awful poor. Lots of times there wasn't what for to eat. That's why I ran away when I was 9, I got tired of being hungry and... seeing my old lady go hungry until she died. - Oh please Joe. - No, I'm not complaining, it's Ok with me. But I just got a lesson in what gives with your kind of people. My kind? I just know that your kind can look through me like I was a pane of dirty glass. Oh, it's not me Joe, it's people like grandfather. - I thought you knew how I felt. - Sure I know, anything for the cause. I'm not kidding myself sister, I know how I stand with you after you cash in on me. You're wrong about me Joe. Come on. We can quarrel all the way back to NY. Will you scatter the fire. You meant that about me being wrong. - I should've slapped your face. - Why didn't you? Because you would slapped mine back. I don't know what to make of a dame like you. Neither do I. Yes I do. Hey, hey, you home. - You'd better take the car darling. - Ok. Won't you say something? - Don't you like it? - I don't know. I don't know whether I like it or not. He says, I don't quite understand it but he says that he's a heap of coke. - A heap of... - That's what he said miss. Hey, tie that thing again for me, will you? Yeah, I liked it. I don't want any slip ups, start spreading at 7:30, ready to spring at 8:00. The Crunk here be in the cage, he's got 6 Gs to start the games with. I'm taking the cash boxes with the false bottoms over the hotel myself Joe. But see those dames don't get their hands on them. Hey, watch that. Soon as we fold, everybody back to the boat. That's all. - Hey Swede? - Yeap? Are you set to sail tonight? I've ordered the tugs and the tide will be just right. Good. Swede, what do you know about Bascopolous? I don't mean me, the sailor that kicked off. My name sake. Well nothing much Joe, why? Oh, I just got an idea I might've got somebody wrong. - A letter came for him the other day. - Hey Crunk, give me that shirt. - For Bascopolous? - Yeah, I was going to tear it up. Wait a minute, I got it on me here somewhere. - Yeah, here it is. - Open it up. - What's it say? - It's in Greek. - Anybody on the boat read Greek? - No. Too bad, I'd like to know about that guy. - I tell you what you can do. - What? There's a little Greek church about a block from the pier. Why don't you drop in and have the priest read it to you in the way uptown. Yeah, I might do that. Came to say so long Joe, got my call for tomorrow. - Want to go to our party? - No thanks. - Need any dough? - No, I'm Ok. - Alright soldier, all the luck. - Thanks Joe. - You wish to see me? - Yeah father. I got a letter here, it's written in Greek. I can't read Greek. Kind in a hurry but I'll pay you if you'll read it for me. You can drop it in he poor box as you go out. I'm here to help those who need it. From your mother, eh? Yes so it is. Your mother has a very good name Maria, a holy name. Joseph, my beloved son. God grant this letter reaches you. Always you have broken my heart by the wicked things you have done. Yet surely when you hear of the terrible thing... that has happened to those who love you, I believe that God will open your eyes... and cleanse your heart. That's enough father, thanks. I just wanted to know who it was from. I write to tell you of my great pride in my other sons... your brothers. Now it must be your pride too... as well as your sorrow. It happened two Sundays ago as we were coming from church. There was a roaring in the sky and suddenly, great parachutes began to drift down toward the meadow below the village. We were too startled to do more than stare with open mouths. Save for your brother Petros... his face grew black with anger. Men of Greece, he shouted to the others... the carrion birds are falling upon our flocks, come with me. There were 5 guns in our village... but there were pitchforks and scythes and men of great strength. Your brother Petros and your brother Euladio... led the other men into the meadow. There were patches of white lilies... and before the hour was done it was as thought the field were covered... with red lilies. Not one of our men lived... but a 100 Germans died... and Greek honor lived for an added hour. They possess our village of course, I earn food by making their beds... and washing their dishes at the inn. Yet I am sustained by my god and my great pride. Thy mother Maria. May God comfort you. Let's say a prayer together. Kneel down. Our father, thou who seeist all human suffering. We beseech thee to bring consolation to the heart of this mother. And to all the mothers of this war torn world. And to the hearts of their sons, bring courage... and the will to oppose evil... as this woman hath brought it to her son Joseph... who in thine eyes, is the brother of all men. Joe, do you know what time it is? Why you've stayed away? Have any trouble with the old man? He's out of town, he told Foster he was going to Washington to find Mr. Hargraves. - How's the party? - Awful. Look, there's nobody here. Yeah, what? It's wonderful. Everyone is upstairs and their simply throwing away money. - Dance with me? - Later. - Hi boss. - Hello Joe, where you've been all this time? - Going to let me win today Joe? - Hello Joe, haven't seen you since Rio. - What happened to that boat? - Going south this winter? Hello Joe. Hi you boss. I was going to send Herbie out to look for you. - How is it coming? - Like shooting fish in a barrel. Open up. - Just passed the 100,000 mark. - Get me 6 Gs. You sure picked a soft touch boss, our grab ought to be over 200 grand. You ever sit on a park bench for 2 hours and look at yourself? Our grab is nothing. Eh? But I thought you said we were taking the whole thing. I'm keeping enough to pay off the boys, the rest goes to war relief. But Joe... You don't mind if I double cross myself, do you? See who that is. Look out, got to see Joe. Listen Joe, there a couple of parole officers down at the boat. - What have they got on you? - Not me, J. Bascopolous. It turns out he was a 3 time loser under the Baume's law. - Three convictions? - Yeah. I knew that'd put you on the spot, so I checked up. I found this letter from the parole board, in some old clothes he left behind. One more rub with the law and Bascopolous goes up for life. You better beat it Joe. Not tonight. Well, I stall them but suppose they come here? - My neck is clean. - It worries me Joe. - You got a Roscoe on you, ain't you? - Sure. You better stash that boss, why take a chance? Ok. - Thanks for the tip. - That's alright Joe. - If there's anything I can do to help you. - Sure, stick around. If you see those bulls in the crowd, give me the office. How we doing checker upper? When the boss ain't here, this cage is private. Ok Crunky, so it's private. - Who's in the gas box? - The sandwiches are for the boys. Yeah, I think I'll have a talk with them. I mean the boys, not the sandwiches. - Hi you boys. - Hello Zepp. What's the matter, briny marlin? - Bad? - I woke up. - Something happened to me too. - Yeah, what? I was struck by lightening. - Nobody dancing. - Does it matter? Remember this, I didn't lie to you, but you were right and I was wrong. For me you're right, always. You'll get everything you want, you'll get enough to fill 2 ships, maybe 3. There's something else I want. You stay away from guys like me, you'll only get hurt. I'm clearing out Tonight. Take me with you Joe. Dot. I believe you know Mr. Hargraves. This is Captain Costello of the police department. - They're here at my request. - Grandfather you broke your word. Nothing of the kind. Captain Costello is here to stop this gambling. But first I'm going to prove to you what this blackguard is. - Do you know he's a thief? - Grandfather. He cashed your check for 6,000 dollars. - Did you get the money, Hargraves? - I did not, my thought he tore up the check. Relax chump, you were out of town, I couldn't find you. Here, 6,000 even. - Well, I, I suppose I really... - That's alright. Don't apologize. Everything clear now? No, everything is not clear. Not until you get out of here. I want this gambling stopped. I don't want any scandal Dot, if you don't stop it immediately... I'll have to get this officer to do it for you. Alright, you're far enough ahead. Send the committee to the cage, we'll count up. Dot my child I... Excuse me I have to find the committee and send them up. All bets down. - Stop the betting. - Make this your last game. Tell them we're closing up, have the dealers bring the cash boxes into the cage. Yes sir. - Monty, stop the playing. - Ok Joe. That'll be all ladies and gentlemen. Crunk, we're clo... The law is downstairs, we're closing up the games. Where's the Crunk? Who you think you were fooling Joe? We knew that dame had a ring through your nose since the first night. I'm declaring myself back in the old partnership, any arguments? All that parole board needs to know is that Bascopolous operated... this scam and those one way doors clamp shut for good. - I can prove I'm not Bascopolous. - Ok, then you're Joe Adams the draft dodger. That's good for 10 years in Leavenworth. - You got to be a good boy Joe. - Ok. - I know when I'm licked. - Here come the dames to check up. Let them in. When those cash boxes come in, don't fool around with those false bottoms. Because things might happen. Oh Mr. Bascopolous, isn't it wonderful. I'm babyish and utterly happy. - Everyone is penniless. - Ladies, these are some of our boys. - How do you do? - Oh, here come the cash boxes. Crap table 3. Step up and check your profits. - Now how this one open? - Crap table number 1.> Oh, what lovely money. Just like Christmas. - Ain't very much. - 37, 38, 39, 40, 41... - Why it's only 41 dollars. - We'd very bad luck for last hour. - Only $94. - Bad night lady. - Maybe this one will be nice and full. - I think this feel light dear. $120, 1, 2. I can't believe it. What do going to tell people? Better think up something. Oh this is awful. Mary, how much have you got? Oh Veronica, only 208 dollars. - Is that the last box? - That's all. - 87 dollars. What's the total? - I'll have in a moment. Joe Joe, how much did we make? - They're adding it up now. - 812 dollars, total. - Run of bad luck for the house. - But enormous sums changed hands. I saw it. - Nothing you can do about it now. - Well, there's something I can do about it. - There's a policeman downstairs. - Wait a minute. I knew we were losing but I didn't think it would be this bad. - But how did you know? - Joe told me. - Didn't you Joe? - That's right. I've known for the last hour. - But Dorothy you know perfectly well... - No I don't. We better go down stairs and make up a story. Alright boys, get busy on the boxes, come on. So you tipped off the dame they were losing, eh? - Yeah. - What do you figure the take? Around 200 Gs. Alright boys, leave the dough on the desk, get back to the boat. Gaffer, pay off those extra dealers. Start moving out the equipment. - Come on, roll it up, let's get going. - You roll it up, I trust you. - Joe. - Don't let her in Joe. She might get hurt, remember this is your gun. Joe, let me in please. Joe I... Oh Joe. I lied because I couldn't live thinking of you locked up. But whether I live or die, I can't let you take that money Joe. - Get her out of here. - Please, give it to me. It doesn't belong to either one of us, give it to me and get away. - Get her out of here. - Wait a minute, look... You just aren't any good, are you? You never were any good. - I've got to take that money Joe. - No. No. Joe, let me go. Now I recognize you, Joe boy. Come on, let's scram. - Open up. - Open the door. - Open up. - Open the door. Come on, break it down boys. - Miss Bryant Mr. Bryant. - Are you alright my dear? Call an ambulance, get that man to a hospital. Right away sir. Baby you've got nine lives. I'll have the slug out of you in a minute. Here, bite on this. - How you feel? - Fine chump. Hold it. Mr. Bryant is out madam and Miss Dorothy isn't... You needn't bother to announce us Foster, we'll go right up. I'm afraid Miss Dorothy won't see you madam. - Dorothy, Dorothy. - Yes. I've been trying to reach you all morning. We better make some sort of statement to the newspapers. Have you seen the morning papers, isn't it awful. I haven't seen the papers. Then you have heard about our freighter, it was sunk before it even got here. So even if we had the money, we couldn't send the supplies. Poor dear, it's been quite a shock. Well, we better decide what were going to tell the reports ourselves. Oh, after all, I made the decision to allow the gambling, it's all my fault. - I know, but what can we possibly tell them? - Well, we can make a dignified statement. - We were taken in. - Mary, Veronica... ask the reports to come into the library, I'll see them myself, alone. - Oh, no Dorothy. - This is not of your fault, it's all mine. - But I'm just as responsible... - No you're not. There's only one thing for me to do and that's tell the truth. Ask them to come in, will you? Well, she's not going to see them without me. Nor me. Oh Foster, ask the reports to go into the library Miss Dorothy will see them there. Yes madam. Don't let them in, I want to see Miss Bryant. Are you Miss Bryant? No, you wouldn't be, neither would you. - Miss Bryant is in her room. - She's not seeing anybody. She'll see me, I got a bundle for her. You can leave it with me if you wish. Well, I don't wish, I'll give it to her myself. Where's her room? - Excuse me ladies. - Just a moment. - What's this? - What's it look like. Yeah, you'd be the one alright. - This money is for you. - Wait. - Wait a minute, where is he? - Where's who? Where did you get the money? Why, a man I met in the park asked me to bring it to you. Oh, you're lying to me, where is he? Where is Joe? Joe? I don't know any Joe. What did he look like? The man who gave you the money? I don't know, never saw him before in my life. - What happened Swede? - Where you get that butt? I promoted it off a guy. One cough out of you and you'll fill this seat with oatmeal. - Then what happened? - Not a thing. - Did it go alright? - Why wouldn't it? - How did she look? - Just like you said Joe. That's how she looked. Hello, yes? But if you check all the hospitals... Yes, keep looking. Now see here Dot, this is got to stop, you're looking ill. I know you mean well grandfather, but please, won't you go away, leave me alone. And if you did find him, what could you do? What can I do? I'd put my arms around him and never let go. Oh, fiddlesticks. Hello. How it's said in this paper, our relief ship is ready to sale. Isn't it wonderful. It's the luckiest thing getting that ship and the wonderful publicity. The war relief is the talk of the town, donations are simply pouring in. You know Dot, I haven't been feeling very well lately. I'm counting on you to go on a little trip with me down south. What you think of that, eh? Palm beach for instance for a few weeks. What you think of it? - Hi Mr. Bryant. - How do you do. Good morning Miss Bryant. Well, we solved that case for you. He's dead. - Who's dead? - Bascopolous. He was a wrong guy alright, look at that record. 3 years at San Quentin, 2 at Leavenworth... 5 at Sing Sing and a whole list of petty violations. - Oh no? - What's the matter? - This isn't... - That's not Bascopolous? - No. - That's him alright. Me and Sam checked our facts with the coroners office. We also checked with the captain of the gambling boat he was on. We couldn't find the owner, he was missing. The boat was missing too but we finally ran it down. Over at pier 48 they're loading a ship... called the Briny Marlin with medical supplies from this office. What? What? What did you say the name of the ship was? The Briny Marlin, at least that's what they call it now. Where's Joe? Where's Joe? Please tell me where Joe is. Joe. Take me with you, please darling. I love you, please take me with you. You don't belong with a grifter like me. You just got some mud on your dress, that's all, give it time, let it dry. - It'll brush off. - Oh no Joe. Joe I love you, please take me with you. Joe, please Joe... Joe, please Joe... Joe please... Good bye, Briny Marlin. - And that was the end of it. - What, what happened to the Greek? Just what he said would happen. He delivered the stuff then he joined the merchant marines. Coming back the Briny Marlin drew a dead heat from a German torpedo. Funny a guy like him winding up that way, eh? Can't kill a fella like Joe. Anyway, we've been home ten days now, that's why I'm hanging around. He went up town for a while and I told him I'd meet him here. I knew she was going to be here and I was kind of hoping. - Alright, I see what you mean. - Yeah. - Hey Swede, where you've been? - Waiting for you, that's all. Come on Joe, the Dinghy is at the end of the pier, let's get back to the ship. Changed my mind, we're not going back to ship tonight. Oh, listen Joe... Come on, it's our last night ashore, I got a cab waiting outside, we're going uptown. Ok Joe. Hey wait a minute, one of you guys got to do something about this. - About what? - Look... You got a Dinghy tied up at the end of the pier. It can't stay there, it's against regulations, it's a menace to navigation. Hey that's right. One of you is got to row it back to this end of the slip. Ok, go ahead Joe. - Why should I? - I could order you to, you know. - Yeah, but you wouldn't. - Well, one of you got to do it. Why don't you flip for it? You're a gambler, ain't you? Yeah I've done a little gambling in my time. Here, I got one. Ok, no heads, you bring the dinghy back and tails he does. What you say? - That's the only way you going to settle it. - Why not? Ok, you got a deal. Ok, heads it is. Joe, Joe... Thanks pal.
