Be realistic. It won't be like this... forever. [MOTHER] Of course it will. For a mother and her daughter. [LILAS LAUGHS] What era is this? It will always be like this. [LILAS] You're talking like it's the 1960s... When your mother had so many kids, they didn't even know each other. People would marry based on a photograph, or whatever. That's over now. Now, people are getting married over the internet. So, you mean life has evolved? But there is still a mother and her daughter. [LILAS] But a daughter needs to breathe, you know? I want to move out because this house is shrinking on us. [MOTHER LAUGHS] Let it happen. [MOTHER] This is impossible. Mission impossible. [LILAS] Are you and your mum still living together? - Be realistic. - Yes, but... [LILAS] When? I'm turning 25... My mother let go of me because I got married and settled down with kids. So, I have to get married and have kids? [MOTHER] Well, there'd be someone beside you... I don't want someone beside me, I am beside me. I can learn.

[BASSEM] If you move... to play with Lilas, and you're doing the thing together... this place is empty. Something, someone has to fill it. - Yeah. - And sometimes, when you go on stage, and you give all the energy, at the second song you're exhausted. - Yeah. - Don't do that. Yeah.

[MOTHER] It's not time for news! [WOMAN, ON TV] The Lebanese band, Mashrou Leila, takes on controversial topics like homosexual and transexual rights. The band is facing pressure from religious authorities and the public. The death threats are seen by the band as part of a campaign that accuses them of blasphemy. [SOFT, UNEASY MUSIC; CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK] [WOMAN] Hello. Thank you for being with us today. This campaign prevented a concert with threats of violence and bloodshed. We can no longer separate artistic repression from the hatred and discrimination affecting many people in our society. Today, a concert. Before that, homosexuals. Before and after that, the refugees. If we don't protect our right to sing today, we will surely lose our right to speak tomorrow. [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [WOMAN, IN ENGLISH, ON PHONE]Listen, I have some bad news.

So, unfortunately, we can't use you guys as the closing performance. I'm really sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS, IN ENGLISH]I don't think there's actual freedom of expression in Lebanon. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS] I would go online and check our videos, and people would call us sluts or whores. [IN ARABIC] "God save us." [IN ENGLISH] "This is satanic and... "such an abomination."

[IN ARABIC] I'm playing the same fucking tempo. - Go ahead, play without me. - [HAMMERING SNARE DRUM INTRO] [MUSIC - "EXTINGUISH THE SUN" BY SLAVE TO SIRENS] [MUSIC CONTINUES, SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] [INDISTINCT YELLING] [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [SHE GROWLS COMICALLY, MUSIC SUBSIDES] [SHE WINCES, GRUNTS RHYTHMICALLY] [SHERY, IN ENGLISH] Hi, guys. [IN ARABIC] With all honesty, I can't take it any more. The way Lilas is berating me. And the way she's picking fights with everyone. Tension is always high. No-one can say a word. I don't know how to fix it alone. I'm sure I can't fix it. That's why I'm sorry but... [IN ENGLISH] I'm leaving the band. I got very upset... [IN ARABIC] ...because... [IN ENGLISH] ...I just saw, like, how out of sync we were, and how far from a unit we were. And I think that... ...what's growing us apart musically is our internal conflicts [IN ARABIC] with each other. There are always things that are unspoken. Always. [IN ENGLISH] But this is... We have to be honest with each other, and I don't think we are being totally honest, maybe with ourselves, I don't know. - We used to go out and shit, right? - Mm-hm. Right or wrong? [IN ARABIC] What does that have to do with anything? [IN ENGLISH] Is it true or not? [IN ARABIC] What does that have to do with anything? [IN ENGLISH] Is it right or wrong? [IN ARABIC] What does that have to do with anything? It's relevant because... [IN ENGLISH] Whatever happened in the past, I moved forward. - I moved forward with anyone... - [SHERY] I really hope so. Okay. But it was disrespectful... [IN ARABIC] ...for you to make that decision over WhatsApp. - Why? - [LILAS] We are not selling potatoes. Come talk with us as a band and we make that decision together. Because it's like [IN ENGLISH] you're selling us, like... [SHERY] I'm not selling anything... [IN ARABIC] "I don't care, I'm leaving the band." No. We created something together. [IN ARABIC] Keep personal things [IN ENGLISH] out of the band. That's my mentality. [IN ARABIC] Whatever is happening in the band is business. - [IN ENGLISH] I really hope that, but... - [IN ARABIC] Don't tell me you hope... [IN ENGLISH] Dude, the thing is, it wasn't showing for me. I was like, [IN ARABIC] "Why is she acting like that towards me? "Why is she throwing me away like that?" - I wasn't throwing you away, Shery! - [SHERY] Yes, you were! Why were you acting like this with me? [IN ENGLISH] You were fucking kicking me around. And that fucking hurts me. [IN ARABIC] And this is why [IN ENGLISH] I'm fucking leaving. All right. We're not a fucking unit. - [LILAS] I wonder why. - [IN ARABIC] I'm telling you why! - [CHAIR SCRAPES FLOOR] - Fuck you and fuck this band! That's it. [INDISTINCT ARGUING; VOICES OVERLAP] That's it. I don't want her in the band, and I don't want to be in the band!

Come on! [MUSIC CONTINUES; INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [MUSIC CONTINUES, AMPLIFIER BUZZES SOFTLY] [PLAINTIVE GUITAR MUSIC] [BASSEM] Metal is about pure 100% sacrifice. You know the problem when you're an all-female band? - [MUSIC CONTINUES] - You don't have reserves. Reserves? What do you mean? Male bands, [IN ARABIC] if they fight with a guitarist, they just get another. - Ah! - [BASSEM CHUCKLES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [CAT MEWLS SOFTLY] [MUSIC SUBSIDES; BOTTLE OPENS, HISSES] I'm tired because we're circling the same story. I don't know what her problem is! We all argue, but then we make up and it's fine. But with her, I don't know! [ALMA] Man, she was really pissed off. Didn't you notice? - No. - [ALMA] She was fuming. My senses are not tuned in 24/7 to why each one of you is upset with me. [MAYA] You only think about yourself. [LILAS] Why? Have I ever mistreated her? [INSECTS CHIRR] [MELANCHOLY GUITAR MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS, IN ENGLISH]Maybe I was... just in denial. Because I was thinking, "Oh, society, "Oh, my mother, she would know". It's really bad. It's not okay. My first experience with a girl changed everything. But I was like, "No, no, no, no". - [MUSIC CONTINUES] - [SARAH] Make a wish! Wish, wish, come on. Cut the cake. - [DAD] Happy birthday, dear. - [SHERY] Happy birthday, dad.

I wasn't... aware of it. [MUSIC CONTINUES; INDISTINCT YELLING, CLAMOURING] [LILAS] Until this explosion happened, it's just... [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS] I just started imagining that the water around Beirut... is filled with dead bodies. People are still missing. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS] Home doesn't feel safe. Friendship doesn't feel safe. Love doesn't feel safe.

It's hard. [LILAS STRUMS DISTORTED CHORDS] [IN ENGLISH] I need Shery here. [LILAS INHALES, SIGHS] [LILAS, IN ARABIC] Okay, what other songs are there? Honestly, if I can't find a guitarist, I have no patience to go in the same cycle I was in [IN ENGLISH] years ago. I know it's hard. [IN ARABIC] There is a candidate but... I doubt she's [IN ENGLISH] as good as... - Shery. - Shery, yeah. [IN ARABIC] There's a specific style we don't want to move away from. Exactly. [IN ENGLISH] Shery has that specific style. I love it, [IN ARABIC] honestly. I just wish she'd be reasonable. [TATYANA] Just for the sake of the band.

[MAN 2] People are homeless, and responders are still assessing the damage. [VOICE CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS, IN ENGLISH] When Shery and I met, we were in the middle of the riot. People were screaming and shouting at the government. And I looked at her, and she looked at me and was like, "Okay, what do you listen to?" [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS] At some point, I mistreated her. I was fighting with myself. But I never wanted it to affect the band. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC SUBSIDES GRADUALLY] [LILAS] I woke up... feeling like, "Okay, I should cut my hair". - [MAYA CHUCKLES] - It was just heavy, it's like a burden. I needed to get rid of that burden. After what happened... [IN ARABIC] ...with Shery and all this mess... [MAYA] Mm. [IN ENGLISH] ...it made me take a... [IN ARABIC] I don't know, [IN ENGLISH] a step back. [IN ARABIC] For sure. I told Shery many times. Shery... [IN ENGLISH] Most of the time, she inspires me, actually. To... do more. Because whatever... [IN ARABIC] She writes challenging music... [IN ENGLISH] ...so I get more motivated to just... to catch up on what she is writing, [IN ARABIC] for example. - [IN ENGLISH] Or skills, or... - [MAYA] Eh... [IN ARABIC] But now, [IN ENGLISH] I don't know. [SHE INHALES] [IN ARABIC] We need to come back together. [IN ENGLISH] Do it again. [MAYA, IN ARABIC] Did you talk to her? Thank you. - [MAYA] Looking fresh. - Thank you. - [SOFT RATTLE] - [LILAS] Oh, great.

Where did you say you are going? Jaledib. I'm coming back home! [SOFT ELECTRONIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS, IN ENGLISH] I used to think love is just poetry, "Ooh, la, la", romantic dinners, and sex. But no, it's different. It's complicated. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [LILAS] You can't love someone if you don't have love for your own self. [MUSIC CONTINUES] - [SHERY] Bon appetit. - [LILAS] Thank you. So, how was the party yesterday? [BOTH CHUCKLE] Who did you meet? - [IN ARABIC] A lot of people. - [IN ENGLISH] Mm-hm, yeah. It was wild and hot and... Yeah. - [SHE CHUCKLES] - I was drunk.

[IN ENGLISH] I was expecting my date to come on time, [IN ARABIC] but she arrived two hours late. So, I started drinking alone. Then [IN ENGLISH] random girls [IN ARABIC] walked in and got shots. [IN ENGLISH] And they were like, "Give that beauty over there a shot!" - I'm like, "Okay, let's go!" - Yeah! [IN ARABIC] We took shots then... two more girls walked in, also drunk and, I don't know... - [IN ENGLISH] ...we made out. - [IN ARABIC] With all of them? - No, just those two. - Oh, just two of them? [SHERY LAUGHS] - Oh, shit. Shh, Shh... - [SHE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] And lots of things. [IN ENGLISH] Then my date [IN ARABIC] arrived, and we went to Club Projekt. [IN ENGLISH] We danced until 5:00.
