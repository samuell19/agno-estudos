Translation: neet21 [these subtitles may contain inaccuracies and grammar mistakes] My wife has passed away. (Romance Doll) (10 years ago) Excuse me. Ah, as I thought I shouldn't have to. You scared the hell out of me. Can I help you? Well ... Kato sent me here. Oh, it's you. The freelancer who graduated from U.S. University. Come on in. Excuse me. - Come on in. - All right. - Come on in. - All right. These are ... What's wrong? These are ... Well ... Dolls. The bodies of love dolls. Love dolls? Bodies? What? Your senior didn't tell you anything? Yeah, he just told me to come here. You really have a nice senior. They used to call it dutch wife. Dutch wife? They now called it, love doll. It's not filled with air. The inflatable doll was an old model. Ah, yes. You have to put a hole in it. Hole? In other words, a woman's ... Get it? In this country, these can only be sold as sex toys. Kinkin, the new employee is here. Oh, god. Kinkin. The new employee has arrived. Welcome. This is Aikawa Kinji. The modeler here. Modeler? Who's in charge of making the dolls. And this is ... I'm Kitamura Tetsuo. He was tricked into coming here. It's no big deal. That's pretty much how most new people came here. All I know is inflatable dolls. This one? Yeah, that's the one. It's a bit like the aunt just now, isn't it? May I touch it? Yes, that's okay. Eh? There are still any jellies left? I hid it. - Have you washed your hands? - I have. But this one can't be washed out. It's from when we used to make PVC dolls because the PVC needed to be heat-treated. You want some? I'm sorry, my hands aren't all clean. Thank you. You know. I want to make a perfect doll. This is made of latexes. It's just latex rubbers. But it's a big step up from the inflatable ones. But it's not durable and it's hard to clean. This is made of PVC. It's more resistant to dirt and more durable. The texture of the skin also looks prettier than the latex one. But, you know. When you touch it, feels like something's not perfect. I want to make dolls that are closer to the feel of human skin. And that's how we got this silicone doll. It took me three years just to develop it. You touch her thighs. It's completely different from the previous one. Right? But you know. That's not even close to my goal. Perfect doll has to have the feel of human skin. Sexy and has attractive looks. Unibody with no seams. I think that kind of doll can even host souls. Is that so? I see. What do you think? Do you want to try this job? There's a lot of competing companies now. If we don't have a good modeler we're going to lose orders, too. The only modeler we have is Kinkin. This factory is like an oldster cemetery. - Hey, why did you say that? - I didn't say that. What do you think? Would you like to try it? I will give it a try. What? Really? That's great. So, the average age goes down a little bit. It goes down a little bit. That's great. I feel a little sorry for them. Even if you told me to pursue “perfection” I still don't have much interest in making dolls myself. There's no desire to bring this remote factory back to life. This just because I need money. (The 1980s doll; made of latex) You seem so good at it. You're quite talented. - It's fun, right? - Yeah. Do you know what the weight ratio of silicone to water is? 1:1.1 That's right. That's why dolls have to be made a little smaller than humans. Or they'll be too heavy. The so-called neutron is equivalent to a human visceral. There's a technique to reduce the weight of the neutron. I know. Don't you need to take notes? Okay. - Yes, like that. - Yeah. It's not good. Not good at all. - Eh? - Don't give me that reaction, Tetsuo. Are you really a sculpture major? Let's start with the breasts. They don't look real at all. It's not like the bigger the breasts, the better. Listen up. The most important thing is authenticity. I don't want big breasts, I want nice breasts. Beautiful breasts. I don't think the customers will be satisfied with this. Redo it. It's a matter of the company's future. Get it. When was the last time you touched a woman's breasts? Why do you ask that all of a sudden? Answer me first. When was it? I broke up with my last girlfriend about three years ago. You haven't touched a woman's breasts in so long? Watch your voice. You're too loud. You can't. How can you make a doll that will surprise boss with that? And when did the last time you touch it? Not long ago I touched Tashiro's breasts through her clothes. Are you guys in that kind of relationship? I'm joking. I'm glad you're joking about it. I'm sure she'd be thrilled if I did. I'm good at it. That's not easy to say. What's wrong? How about making dolls out of the real human body? Somebody's got to be willing to do that. That's true. You can't take Tashiro as your archetype. But, since we're going to do it. How do I put it. Wouldn't it be better if we could make it more realistic? Since we're going to do it. I think so. Since we're going to do it. - Ah, how about live models. - Yeah? You use live models for sculpture and painting. But I don't think it's good. Even the sculptures don't directly use a human body. And it's not easy to explain. It's still a little impolite to say that for the production of adult products. No, let's just try it. Did you hear what I just said? How do you explain it? It might be a little risky for us to do this. Aren't there breast implants for medical use? Yes, I guess. Let's just say that's what we do, what do you think? That's a real risk. Right? Right what? But, you know. I'm at the end of the rope here. I want to make a perfect doll. I'm going to spend the rest of my life on it. This looks too suspicious. Not at all. If we don't look like medical staff, we will get caught. No one wears a lab coat in a remote factory. It'd rather look normal in work clothes. It cost me 4,309 yen. That's expensive. Mr. Aikawa, why is this one waisted? What? This is for women. Really? No wonder I didn't think it was easy to button up. What the hell? You look good. It suits you. No, I'd rather take it off. Don't take off. - What? But it's hard to move. - It's an order from your superior. What are you talking about? Not everything in the world needs to be explained. Don't put a big label on it. Stop it. - Loosen your grip a little. - No. Let go of me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Coming. I'll open the door for you right now. I'm the live model, Ozawa Sonoko. - You're the model who applied. - Right. Ah, I see. - It's a pleasure to work with you. - Thank you for having me. Please come in. This way. Come on in. The room is upstairs. I'm sorry, this is the only room left. - Would you please change here? - Okay. I'm counting on you. Thank you for having me. It's a great deal. Who's doing it? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? We're going to make a mold, right? That's why we brought the model here. Of course, it must be me. Isn't your hand gesture suspicious? Let's have jankenpon and the winner goes. Well, that's fine. Come on, then. Fists first! Wait a minute. Starting with rock! Go on. Starting with rock! I win! Boobs! Boobs! Yes? I'm ready. All right, I'm counting on you. Here you go. Actually, I still can't do it. It's too intense. But, we just dealt with it. Should the earrings be taken off? Ah, yes. You can put it on this. - Thank you. - No problem. - Let's do this. - Let's do it. It's going to be a little cold. Then I'll start. - Then I'll take it off. - Okay. Excuse me. It seems it should be taken off by yourself. You can do it? - Yeah, I think I can. - Good. What's wrong? I'm sweating a lot. Then I'll change my clothes first. Are you okay? You're sweating so much. It's okay. It'll go away soon. I'm sorry, we don't have a shower here. Don't worry. - Thank you for your hard work. - Good work. How's it going? I was a little nervous, but I got it done. - Did you touch it? - How could I touch it? Don't you want to touch it? I'd love to touch it, but that's a crime. I'll go ask her. Wait a minute. What are you doing? Nothing, I just going to ask her. Wait a minute. With all due respect, are you stupid? I'll ask her, and there's no extra charge. If you don't pay, you'll more likely get caught. What will you do next? Everything is about opportunities and challenges. I don't think we should take this challenge to kill ourselves. We were lucky if she didn't call the police. You just poured a mold and didn't touch it. Do you think that's how you get the perfect breasts? Don't look down on the breasts. - Excuse me. - Wait a second. Well, it's very hard to talk about, though. But I'd like to discuss it with you. Go ahead. Since a long time ago, our goal is to recreate the proper breast implants. You know, if we just make a reverse silicone mold. It's still not quite enough. So, I mean ... Can I have my assistant, Kitamura, touch your breasts? It's like palpation. Is that okay? I'm sorry, Ms. Model. This man has just recovered from a serious illness. But he hasn't fully recovered yet. Because this man, no matter what, wants to recreate一 What are you talking about? I'm really sorry about this. Just pretend you've never heard of it. I'm so sorry, excuse us. It's okay, I can. What? I understood. As long as my breasts can help people, that's okay. Well, then ... That's ... - Thank you for your support. - Thank you for having me. “This is heaven on earth” That was what I thought when I touched it. The sensation of the breasts in my hand has changed. In short, the nipples ... No, it's more like ... It's like “Heidi: Clara Stands” moment. No, probably not quite like. I couldn't explain it, but that's how it felt. A-are you done? Yes. Thank you, I'm going out first. - Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you very much. - You've worked hard, bye. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. She's leaving. Hey, what's wrong with you? Did she say anything? You know, sue you or something? No, that's not it. Then what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. But why are you so down in the dumps? It's nothing. He's going in the opposite direction. Wait up! Excuse me. You forgot your earrings. Ah, thank you for bringing it to me. No, I think it's very expensive. It's just 500 yen. 500 yen? That's not as expensive as the bus fare to get here. Yeah. The bus fare is still expensive. Thank you so much. Goodbye, then. I'm in love with you. I fell in love with you at first sight. Be my girlfriend. It was the first time in my life that I'd ever told someone how I felt. And it's probably the last time in my life. Are you kidding me? Why did Sonoko say yes so easily? How do I know? But it's a blessing in disguise. It's just ... Just? Just what? My job. She thinks I'm in a medical-related profession. How do I explain it to her afterward? Why don't you just tell her the truth? But, you know, she's ... She's coming over to get her breasts modeled. She thought she was helping people who lost their breasts. If she found out it's actually for adult products what would she think? In that case, maybe you're going to break up. You can still laugh. It was you who made up such a lie. You blaming me? Am I wrong? What? I get it. I will explain it to her for you. You can't even move a bit when you're being modeled, can you? Yeah. I guess it's okay to close your eyes. That's okay. Right? Or you'll burst into tears. What? Ah, you know ... I'm sorry, you go first. It's okay, you go first. That thing, the one that you were working on. How's it going? It went well because of your help. Right? I actually turned down the job when I first got it. The location was not in the research institute but in the factory. And I was worried about being cheated. But I made up my mind. And thought, “this would be more meaningful than I usually do as a live model for sculptures or paintings.” But ... our job isn't that great. - Right? - No. I really think you're both amazing. And I, though only indirectly. When I think of the good work you're doing for others, it's ... such a special, special pleasure. No, I can't. - I'm gonna go to the toilet. - You go. - Here. - Thank you. - Can I ask you something? - Yes, go ahead. What is it about him that you like? - Well, that's ... - What? - Do I have to say it? - Yes. Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep all night. I like him because ... This may sound a little strange to you. - It was him, right? - Yeah? - While he was touching my breasts ... - What? What? It's really weird, isn't it? At the time I thought ... this guy's a little clumsy, though. But he must be a gentle person. That's what my gut tells me. Of course, that's the first time I've ever liked a person in such a strange way. So, I had been thought “what's wrong with me?” That's why I wanted to go back home right away. I see. Breasts. - You owe it to me. - It hurts. Right? - That hurts. - That's great. Not bad. It's good. All right, pass. Take the orders. Love dolls made from a mold of Sonoko's breasts (The model was taken from a real woman, Sachiko) had a huge impact. (The model was taken from a real woman, Sachiko) A new group of people called the marionettist was born. (Love Doll Heals Heart) They role-play dolls by giving them personalities. (Exploring hidden worlds and living with love dolls) It's gotten tremendous media attention. However ... - What does a love doll mean to you? - Most importantly, she's modeled after a real woman. And her breasts are real. And now ... I can't go back to a real woman. Sachiko has taken over my heart. The more I think about it, the more I can't tell Sonoko about this job. I'm just carrying around a secret. On this auspicious day Kitamura Tetsuo and Ozawa Sonoko will be wed in a marriage The wedding ceremony continues please offer the letter Tetsuo! Tetsuo! Put it on my finger. What a fool. I'm exhausted. That's great. It went well. It went well? I'm now being your wife. Please treat me well. I'm also now being your husband. Please look after me. Want to clean up? Let's just do it tomorrow. - I put it here. - Okay Please put this in. I'll put it here. - Tetsuo, you ... - What? Newly married and already so busy. Isn't Sonoko angry? She's not. Oh, she's a good wife. If it were me I would have complained. It's delicious. The salads you made are also delicious. I just put some sauce on it. You cut the lettuce beautifully. Ah, it's just encouragement tactics. You get caught. Although I'd like to do it again if you'd give me a compliment. But I might be late back home these days. Yeah, that's okay. Don't force it. Okay. It's not fair. I ate the same amount, but I gained weight. You're still skinny. Did you chew it? - I chewed it. - Or you just swallowed it? Eat slowly. It's a meal made by your wife, right? That's right. Just take your time with the food. By the way, when can I retire? If you aren't here, I'll be exhausted. What? Hey, wait. What are you doing? Hey, I'm saving that for last. Okay, here we go. - Give it back to me. - What are you doing? - Join! - Okay, pose. Tetsuo? Tetsuo? Sorry. We need to stop it, you're tired. Let's sleep tight tonight. I'm sorry. It's okay. Good night. Good night. The product continued to sell like hotcakes. Those kinds of busyness lasted for four years. Where's Mr. Aikawa? He lost money at a pachinko parlor, and went to bed. Ah, I know. I'll go shopping and check on him. Okay. What's going on? Tetsuo, boss calling you. I actually want to challenge the new raw material. - New raw material? - Yeah. It's called elastomer. It's flexible and low cost. I just don't know how durable and recyclable it is. But, it's worth a try. Is silicone not good? No, I like silicone too. But other new companies have emerged one after another. We have to come up with something special. Get it. Go study it with Mr. Aikawa. If we don't have enough people, we'll hire more. Okay. I'll pick it up. - Sorry. - It's okay. Hello, this is the Kubota Chamber of Commerce. Oh, yes, Tashiro. I couldn't reach his family. I should have had their contacts, but I didn't. There's nothing you can do about it. Tashiro, he has done enough. Damn, they're dirty. These are expensive shoes. The rain is so dull. It's annoying. No one cares about what kind of people who came to see him off. So, Mr. Aikawa must be happy now. Tetsuo. He's Morizumi. He's here to help. Boss says it's too hard for you to work alone. I'm Morizumi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. This didn't work as I thought. The elastomer is fine and smooth, though. Right? Isn't it hard? Honestly ... yes. I think it's pretty close to ideal data figures. It reminds me of the days when Kinkin struggled with silicone. Ah, when it went from PVC to silicone. Yes. Somehow ... what you doing now is exactly like he did back then. Never seen it before. Neither do I. - Really? - Come on. Where did you see it? I saw it there. I'm serious. Tetsuo, you've got no eyes. Almost there. Still not good enough? Not that. Turn this value up a little more. I think it can be more flexible. - Then I'll type it in. - Thank you. Something good happens? Why do you ask that? Because you look so happy. Is it? You've been thinking about things lately. The formula for the new material has finally come to light. Improved quality of breast implants will help more people. Ah ... Well, yeah. You know ... What are you trying to say? - This is delicious. - That's good then. Recipes taught on TV. It feels like it's been so long since I ate at a decent hour. Seems so. What are you trying to say? Ah, it's on the tip of my tongue. - I'll try to think of it. - Yeah. Good morning. Morning, Tetsuo. The data was stolen by Morizumi. What? The heck? I was so careless. Hired him without a proper background check. We'll check the new employee's background out properly thus. This is also a sign of how today's era works, isn't it? You're still in the mood talking nonsense? What should we do? Tetsuo. Do we have any chance of winning with elastomer? We'll launch elastomer dolls. Even if it's not new anymore. What do you think? Let me ... Let me think of it. Sonoko? Sonoko? You're back. I fell asleep. You should sleep in the bedroom. You'll catch a cold. Yes. You want dinner? No. - Want me to warm it up for you? - I said no. Eh? You don't have to. You don't have to wait for me. Sorry. Things aren't going well at work. I'm tired. Okay. I'm sorry. I'll go to bed first. Okay. Good night. Good night. I'd like to talk to you about something Will you be back later today? From: Sonoko Look at the softness. This is the latest material elastomer developed by our company. Not bad, right? Don't you want to try it? It's going to be the era of elastomers. Look at the way it feels. It's amazing. Yeah. I've worked so hard to develop this softness. Ah, yes. It's me who developed it. Why? What a dumb arcade game! - What's the matter? Is she all right? - She's crazy. What a shame, she's cute. You can't hit it that hard. No, no. Stop it. Stop it. What are you doing? - Stop it. - I'm calling the police. - Dumbass. - No, come on. - Dumbass. - Let's go. I'm sorry. I got you into this mess. Ah, nothing. I've never caught a doll once. Neither have I. I've never gotten one in my life. Are you okay? Well ... As compensation, let's go to the karaoke bar. When love blooms it feels a little lonely when I'm with you What I want to ask you is how to forget this perfect relationship My dad is unwell I'm going to see him I'll be back in a few days What happened? Did you have a fight? No, I didn't. Then, what's it? Hello, this is the Kitamura residence. Oh, Tetsuo, how have you been? Ah, mom, hello. How's dad? He's fine as usual. Eh? I can't reach Sonoko's cell phone. That's why I'm calling. Is Sonoko there? Well, now ... She's not here right now. I see. Talk to Sonoko for me. I need to talk to her about the congratulatory gift for her cousin's new son. Yes. So, Tetsuo, take care of yourself, too. Yes, thank you. I hang up the phone, bye. Thank you, bye. The number you are calling can't be reached. Please leave your name and一 - Grab the one in the front. - No, is this okay? See? You'll never catch them. No, is this okay? - No, it's too fast. - Eh? Really? You'll see. - It doesn't work. - See? Listen up. Yes? Can you divorce your wife? Eh? Well, that's ... You're panicking, aren't you? I'm kidding. Let's not see each other again. Okay. That's a bit sad, isn't it? Not really. I'm lonely. Do you despise a hopelessly stupid woman like me? I don't. I'm stupid, too. Yeah, I know. We are stupid. We are stupid. Goodbye. Goodbye. You are Sonoko's husband? She's your wife, right? Oh, I'm sorry. What's going on, Sonoko? Hey, why is this happening? What did she do? There's a class reunion today. You didn't know? Ah, I see. - Here's her thing. - Thank you. Then I'm going back. Excuse me. Sorry to ask, what's your name? I'm Yoshimura. The taxi fare一 It's okay, I'm in a hurry. I'm leaving. Thank you. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry, Kazuya. I'm gonna throw up. Where have you been? Why are you asking? Hometown. What about the reunion? Was it a lie? I forgot to tell you, I'm sorry. How's your dad? He's ... much better than I thought. Why did you lie? Eh? Your mom called the day before yesterday. Because your cell phone is not working. I forgot my charger. That's not what I asked. Where have you been? Sonoko! Don't be so loud. Tetsuo, did you ever tell me when you came back late? That's not the same as a three-day stayed overnight. I want to ask you a favor. I'll be honest with you. But please wait a week. What do you mean? I'm sorry. I've had a long day. It was nice to meet you Can I see you again? From: Yoshimura Kazuya Thanks. One week is up. Yes. Tetsuo what kind of married couple did you want us to be? What is that? What kind of married couple did you want us to be? A cheerful and warm married couple. Is that kind of thing what we're talking about now? I wanted us to be a talkative married couple that honest each other about everything. But that's hard, isn't it? Some things are kept unsaid for the sake of the other person. What are you trying to say? Tetsuo. Is there something you're not telling me? Eh? Is there any? Well ... That's ... How to say that, it can ... It can be counted as something一 There's not? There is. Well. Actually, my job ... is not medical or mannequin related. It's a job to make dolls for adult use. Love dolls. Sorry, I've tried to be honest with you so many times. But it never came out. I'm afraid you'll look down on me if I confess. Do you look down on Mr. Aikawa? How's that possible? So do I. I wouldn't look down on you either. You still don't trust me after all these years. I'm so sorry. Is that all? What? That's not all you didn't tell me, right? I have done it just once, that ... I cheated on you. I'm so sorry. I see. I see. I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. I did it, too. What? I cheated on you. I have done it just once. I'm so sorry. What? What? What? What? Hey? Why? - Why are you so angry? - Of course I'm angry. Didn't you cheat on me, too? I was lonely and was in a trance. People make mistakes. I kept wondering if I've become a burden to you. I had been thought about that. And got sick of it. Even so, you shouldn't have lied like that. And stayed overnight. It had nothing to do with that. It wasn't about cheating. Although you wouldn't believe it either. What's that about? Well ... That's ... You don't need to know. Why? That's because we're going to get a divorce, right? Don't you want to be with your cheating partner? Of course not, I did it just once. That's outrageous. You're the one who wants to be with him. You are wrong. What am I wrong about? Wrong. I want ... I want to live alone happily. What are you doing? What's wrong? You are ... You're in such a hurry to move out. No, that's ... There's a place I have to go. I'll be back in about two weeks. We'll have to go to the Civil Affairs Bureau by then. I'm going to hand my divorce petition. Oh, my God. I don't understand anything you're saying or doing. I've already filled it out. No, no, that's not what I meant. If you really want to get a divorce I can't help it. But we didn't even really talk about it. There was something you wanted to tell me before, wasn't there? What are you hiding from me? It's none of your business. I don't want to talk about it. I won't let you go until you tell me. Okay. I will tell you. I've got cancer. What? I went to the hospital for a checkup at the nights I stayed over. It would make my parents feel worse if I told them I had to deal with it alone. I never thought they'd call home. And ... The results came in recently. I need surgery. I'm going to the hospital now. What? What do you mean? Cancer? What the heck? I didn't feel very well. I started going to hospital. They let me get checked out right away. Why didn't you tell me? I've wanted to say it so many times. But you always weren't home. And you would hate it if I waited for you. Sorry, Taxi's coming. You haven't had any serious illnesses so far? I haven't. And no history of allergies? Yes. Will your family come when the time to explain your condition comes up? I don't have a family. I live alone. But there's a name written in the spouse column. We're getting a divorce. I see. No, we're not getting a divorce. Tetsu, what are you doing? What's next? That's ... We'll take you to your room. There the nurse will explain the precautions. Got it. - This way, please. - Okay. This way, please. Even though I'm incompetent as a husband it's strange that I don't know what kind of cancer my wife has. Stage 2 of Gastric Cancer. Two-thirds of the stomach has to be removed. Mr. Aikawa, I'm going to eat my lunch. What should I do? After I graduated from college I went to a toy factory. Making toys for the kids. Married at 26, got a kid. You have a kid? Yeah, a girl. After I got a kid, I made up my mind to start my own company with my colleague. I wanted to make plastic dolls for kids. I didn't expect my colleague to take the money and run when we were about to start it. Ah, that colleague. And my wife ran away, too. I see. When I saw my daughter again after a long separation she was seven years old. I took her to the zoo. I asked her, “Is there anything you want, Mayu?” She said, “Mr. Aikawa, I want a doll” She called me by my surname. My wife remarried. I guess they made her call me like that. No matter how many times I said, “Mayu, I'm your dad” she would bow her head in embarrassment. I lost my temper and told her “If you don't call me dad, I won't buy you a doll” But then she said, “Forget it” I said, “I'm lying, I'll buy it for you” but she shook her head stubbornly. When we parted, I wanted to give her the doll I secretly bought for her. But her eyes started to tear up while saying “Mr. Aikawa, I'm sorry” She was only a seven years old kid. I couldn't take it anymore, so I went out for a drink and the customer sitting next to me said “My daughter has a doll that looks like that” That happy-go-lucky guy looked so annoying. So I made a scene in the shop. The police came and I was put in custody. That's where I met our current boss. Eh? You guys met in the detention center? It's not like you think. He's an ex-cop. Really? And for some reason, he wanted to start a business. And then here we are. We've been working together for almost 30 years. 30 years, that's a long time. My daughter is 37 years old now. Maybe I have grandchildren somewhere. You boy. You should take good care of your wife. Mistakes ... Mistakes can be made as we're human. How's the research on elastomers going? It's pretty close to the ideal data figures. But ... But what? Honestly, I'm still not sure. Even if it's close to ideal, is it really better than silicone? Of course, elastomers have their advantages, too. It's stretchable. The arm won't break even if you lift it over its shoulder. And it's cheap. But the elasticity, the transparency of the skin, the tactility, the beauty of the doll. If it's for our company which material is more suitable for our dolls? I think we'll see the results in the next experiment. If it doesn't work, do you have any other options? Let me think about it. Coming over at this hour, does it okay? I sneaking in here. How do you feel? I'm good. Thank goodness. Yeah. Any place you'd like to go after discharge? Why do you ask? Is it too cold to go to the beach? How about the hot spring? Tetsuo, we're going ... Sonoko. I don't want to be apart from you. I don't want a divorce. Ever since the last time I got angry, I've been thinking ... I'm sorry. No, I was just mad at myself. I was angry and I'm ashamed. If you're sympathetic and can't leave your sick wife behind, forget it. Who I should sympathize with, I'm not that smart. It would hurt me if you were around. After all ... After all, I can't have kids anymore. So ... you're better off having kids with someone else. I should have known better that you like kids that much. I'm sorry. No. I don't like kids. But if they were your kids I would like them. It's okay ... if I can't have kids. So ... divorce is the result of my careful consideration. I didn't marry you because I wanted kids. I want to be with you. I want to start over. What have I done? What have I done since we got married? I want to be with you. Okay. Let me use silicone, please. You're giving up on elastomer? So far as I can tell I think it's better to go with silicone than elastomer. Because I believe in the power of silicone. Using silicone means continuing the strategy we've always used. If we look at it from the customer's point of view, it's not good for us. Is there anything we could do? I'll take my chances. You're not going to say something like “the dolls with no seams,” are you? Huh? Don't give me that reaction. That's what you all craftsmen want, isn't it? He tried it before, but he gave up. - Do you mean, Mr. Aikawa? - Yes. You weren't here then. Yes. Well, let's give it a try. It seems interesting too. Eh? Is it okay? What's the big deal? I thought you all craftsmen always said. “Do the best you can” Thank you so much. Let's just do it. The seamless dolls could be groundbreaking, right? Well, yeah. But it's hard. Especially the hole part. Hole? That's ... Well, it's ... It's a woman's ... This part ... Ah, that's. - I get it. - Yeah. By the way, it's so cold. It's a nice day. Thanks. Here comes a fluffy dog. Where did you come from? - Yoko. - Ah, there she is. - Yoko, come here. - Come here. - Yoko, Yoko. - Come here, Yoko. You ran off when we didn't pay attention. We're sorry. She's a glutton. The smell of your meal must have attracted her. - She's not giving you any trouble, right? - Not at all. That's good, then. What a nice cooked meal. - It smells good. - It's cold today. It's really cold today. Can't wait until spring when the cherry blossoms bloom. The cherry blossoms are beautiful, aren't they? You know ... some of the flower watchers get drunk and break branches. Cherry blossoms are a bit squeamish. They get sick soon after they're broken off. That's why many of the cherry trees here have withered. But even if it withers it still produces beautiful flowers every year. Even if I don't know what for. - Let's go. - Ah, yes. It's cold and I'm talking nonsense. I'm sorry. - No, that's not a problem. - Goodbye. - Thank you. - Thank you. - See you later, fluffy. - Thank you. - Let's go. - Okay. - It's cold. - Yeah. - Which one is better? - What do you want to eat? Cherry tree can bloom even if it withers. Yeah. When I learned that Sonoko had relapsed it was the time when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. Metastases to the lymph nodes and liver were observed. Mrs. Sonoko has progressive gastric cancer. Even though she's been examined it's going faster than we thought. And in a case like Mrs. Sonoko's, it should be QOL which means the quality of life is your top priority. Can't it be cured? There's nothing you can do? I can help her relieve her pain. Tetsuo. What? You know there's something I'd like to tell you. Yes? That's ... I want ... I want you to make a doll out of my body. Eh? That's ... You haven't made your love doll yet, have you? Hole? As you said before, it's hard to make the hole part. Is it? I wonder if there's anything I can do to help you. You want to help me. Why? Is it okay? It's okay. What about your body? My body is fine. It doesn't hurt either. More than that. I want to make love to you. Your hands are shaking. I haven't done it in a long time. I'm more nervous than I thought. It remains me of the wedding day. You kept shaking. You wore the bride's ring on your finger. At the time, I was like, “What's going on here?” “Why did I wear the bride's ring on my finger?” Spread your legs a little. It's so embarrassing. What are you ashamed of? We're an old married couple. No, it's not because of that. Then, what's wrong? Spread your legs. - No. - I can't draw you this way. Don't. Is it good? Yes. But ... What? I don't know, somehow It's not the same as before. It's extremely good, though. I'm a little scared. Is it because of the infidelity? I guess so. What are you doing? What's that smile for? It wasn't long before I had to face reality. It's like a quid pro quo, as the doll got closer and closer to completion. Sonoko's body was getting thinner. Sonoko, It'd be better if we stop doing it today. No, I'm begging you, don't stop. Keep going on and make a doll out of my body. Do you remember when we went to Birds Hill Park? I do. There must be a lot of cicadas there by now. Let's go see cherry blossoms next year. By the way. There was a dog. It was all furry. What was the dog's name again? Pomeranian dog? I'm not talking about the breed. I'm talking about the dog's name. It sounded like a person's name. I can't remember it. It's on the tip of my tongue. It's just I can't remember it. Everything doesn't need to be remembered. Eh? Because ... if you can remember everything you'll have sad memories, too. Sonoko. Yes? I love you. I really ... I really love you. Yes. Tetsuo. I love you, too. I love you very much. If I let you go now I'll never be able to get inside your body forever. I find that “forever” is the right word for it. Nothing lasts forever. The thing I lost will stay lost, forever. I love you. Sonoko. It's so cold. I have to try it. If I try it means I have to do it. Tetsuo. Sonoko. Sonoko. Sonoko, I remember it now. That dog's name was Yoko. It's a real touch. Body with beautiful shapes. And without splices. Seems there's a soul inside. It's exactly as Mr. Aikawa said. It's like Sonoko is alive again. We were so worried about you. You didn't eat anything. We didn't know what you were doing. I'm sorry I made you all worried. We will name it, Sonoko No.1 Can I ... Can I use hiragana for the doll's name? It's not a real Sonoko, but it's Sonoko nonetheless. I understood. You've worked so hard for it. All right. Let's sell it for the highest price ever. Limited to 100 units. Anyone who doesn't understand the value of this doll is not our customer. Yeah. All right. It's a done deal. Seamless unibody doll There's a soul inside the doll Limited to 100 Sonoko There's still some left Why so fast? That's fast. That's fast, isn't it? It's only been on sale for a few minutes. It's a little over two minutes. Look! They're all sold out. That's amazing, Tetsuo. That's great. You do it. How about 20 to 1? - A little more. - Okay. - Tetsuo, help me move this. - Okay. That's okay, go ahead. I'll pick it up. Wait a moment. I'm coming. Be right there. Hello? This is the Kubota Chamber of Commerce. Sorry, they're all sold out. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. Finally, it's done. Take care! Great. All right, good work, everybody. - Let's go to the potluck party. - Barbecue! Barbecue! Okay, let's have some barbecue today. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt your fun time. Arrest warrant Suspect: Kaoru Kubota Criminal Offence Article 175 of the Penal Code Dissemination of obscene materials It's coming faster than I thought. I think a cop colleague called it in. Okay, don't move. I really can't sell it in Japan. We're already in the 21st century. It's so real. Why did you have to go that far? Are you stupid? All right, we're going to have to shut this place down. Give me some. That one. Thanks for your hard work. Take care. Boss, how could you let them arrest you? I took matters into my own hands. - I did it on my own一 - Tetsuo! Would you please stop trying to be cool? Don't worry. I'll be back in about three days. How many years do you think I've been doing this? Boss has been taken away several times. He's a veteran. I used to be a cop. All right, let's all go to the hot spring when I get back. Staff trip. All right, let's go. You have to wear this. Come on. It's a protocol to wear this. Let's go. How's Nakamura? Come on, cut the crap. I'm just asking. Shut up. Come on, drink your beer. Come on, drink it. Hot spring here is really nice. Indeed. If only Kinkin and Sonoko were here. Tetsuo, look at this. It says here that Kubota's dolls are the best. What's up? Let me see. “Someone else said they were reported, is that true?” Ah, really. “Their boss is capable of doing this” “Those people are so dumb and wonderful” You are all stupid. Sonoko is the best. The best! The best! Beer is the best! Beer is the best! Hot spring is the best, too! Alright. I've made up my mind. Let's do Sonoko No.2 Sounds good. This time we're making dolls that won't be reported. Boss, let me ... In that case I don't want to name it Sonoko. Look, a troubled guy's got another problem. I'm sorry, I know I sounded a little cocky. I understood. Can you make me another good one? I can. Hey, I know, let's do Maria. Let's do Rikako, too. Rikako is no good. I don't want to throw my money down the drain. What drain? Let's sing. I'm gonna sing “Julie” Sonoko No.1 became the legendary love doll. What's going on? There's a thing here that looks like a life preserver. - What is this? - What are you doing? That's disgusting. You know It's called a dutch wife. Dutch wife? What is it? It's a sex doll. If you inflate it, it'll bulge. With this, it's like making love to a woman. That's amazing, I want to try it. I'd like to try it, too. Who would want such an ugly girl? Just turn the light off and close your eyes. But then you won't know if you're in or not. Then turn the light on. But if you turn the light on and you'll see it's ugly. If it looked like a real beautiful woman I'd like to get one. Me, too. I want a beautiful sex doll. Does it exist? The beautiful doll that looks like a real woman. Yes, it does. You'll be able to buy it when you're all grown up. There's so much more fun when you're all grown up. You guys, what are you doing? Oh, no. Coach's got a bamboo sword. Don't run. We married like impulsive kids but yet tried to figure out the best relationship as a married couple. It's ugly. She was pretty, she cooked well. She was a good housewife and supported her husband at all costs. That's what people say about my wife. “She's a capable wife it would be a shame to marry you” Indeed. But there was one thing no one knew about her. The other side of her that only I knew. She's a horny and capable wife. I know all about your soft spot I'll always think of you in the warmth of the sun I finally understand your tenderness but it might be too late What if the weather doesn't cooperate and it suddenly rains hard? But if it would bring us closer together That's enough Somehow it made me so happy I don't know when the time to touch you will end The parts I hated and the parts I liked It was all good I don't know why I've been thinking about that today It's too simple to put that into words They'd laugh at me I'm sure they'll laugh at me for being so dramatic If I close my eyes you'll be right in front of me you're still there, being kind to me Translation: neet21 Thank you for using these subtitles
