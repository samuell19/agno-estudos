[MUSIC PLAYING] RACHEL: Come on, girls. You know it's a big day for me, and I don't want to be late. And, more importantly, I don't want to keep your Uncle Marty waiting this time. Lizzie, come on. You've got to get up. Mom's gonna lose it. Lizzie, get up, bum. Lizzie? [SCREAM] Ha, ha. - That's not funny. - You should have seen your face. Then get out of my side of the room. RACHEL: Guys, I'm starting to lose it. Lizzie's up. Oh, finally. Oh, Sweetie, Mom has got to get in here. Hang on. Oh, really pretty, baby. Mom, Molly's side of the closet has now become the entire closet. You're such a drama queen. And you're a slob. I can't find anything I want to wear. Sweetie, you look beautiful. [SIGH] You said you were going to tell me today. Tell you what? RACHEL: Can we just talk about this later? 'Cause I'm... honey, I'm really nervous about today, - you know that. - Yeah, and that means no. - you know that. - Yeah, and that means no. - No, it... No, it... What means no? Hm! I'm just not exactly excited about my 16-year-old daughter running around New York by herself. But I wouldn't be alone. I'd be with Dad. You're going to see Dad? No, Sweetie, she's not. Mom! Your father works. He works all the time. You know that. - What are you gonna do all day? - Explore the city. Go see NYU. Look, I'm old enough. I'm gonna be going to college in a year and a half. What's the difference? Sweetie, your father only asked you to come spend the summer to get under my skin. It's just complicated. You're making it complicated. Honey, I just think it's important for us to spend time together right now, OK? Fine. Another lame summer. Bum. What? [PHONE RINGING] Hello. You are such a freak. Yeah, we're outside. Sweetie, you have to stop doing that. I mean, we really should just send you off to the circus. Fine by me, circus goes to New York, doesn't it? Ah, there you are. Come on. Hey, hey, hey. Hi, Uncle Marty. Hey, love you, OK? Come on. OK. Hi, Uncle Marty. MARTY: Hi. Thanks for taking them, again. Listen, if you guys go to another Pistons game - today, no junk food, OK? - What? No junk food? Seriously, that's half the reason they go to the game. - Marty. - OK, fine. No junk food. Thank you. How do I look? Um, frazzled. Thank you, very much. No, it's... I have worked in eight years, OK? I'm a little nervous. All right, let me just be the one to tell ya, it still sucks. How about a little bit of optimism? I'm trying to be an independent woman, here. That makes two of us. I'm sure she'll tell you all about it. Listen, I love you. Goodbye. Mu-ah! I'll see you. Thank you. OK. You sure you don't want me to drive you? No, no, no, no. I'm fine taking the bus. The traffic could kill you on the way back. I love you. Be good, OK? OK. Let's go. This is going to be a fun day with Uncle "Mar-tay." [GIGGLING] OK. Mom's frantic. Yeah, she's always frantic. All right, take it easy, kiddo. She's doing the best she can. Who wants some junk food? MOLLY: Me! Yeah! PUBLIC ADDRESS: Attention all Wait! PUBLIC ADDRESS:... to Ferndale. Attention all passengers, last boarding call... Thanks. Again, I'm so sorry to be late. I had to transfer buses, and I just didn't expect the commute to take this long. Where you coming from? Uh, Downtown. Well, that is quite a commute. It... it'll be fine, now. I... I know how much time to give myself. So there's about five years of patient files that need to be transferred to our electronic database. But if you have any problems, or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Five years? How many patients is that? - About 5,000. - Oh. Your father's spirit is at peace. I don't sense any restless energy. Oh! I... can you tell us if he's still in pain? No, no, no pain. He's beyond this world. He's... he's ascended. Excuse me. One minute. Now don't you worry, he's found his way. - Oh. - OK? WOMAN: Yes, yes. Oh, yes. It's OK. All right. Oh, thank you, so much. You're welcome. Yes. You take care now. OK. I didn't know. I'm sorry. It's OK. I don't usually moonlight at work, but they're friends of the family. I'm the head nurse, Belle. You must be Rachel, right? Yes, nice to meet you. Their father passed last week, and they just wanted to know that he found his way. You were talking to spirits? No. He didn't answer. - Excuse me. STELLA: Yeah? Can you help me? I'm... I'm trying to find the Tillman Street bus line. Oh, yeah, yeah. It's just one block down, and then another over. - Thanks. - Do you work around here? Yeah, actually. Today was my first day. Oh, well, it's a wonderful neighborhood. I'm Stella Morgo, the agent for this listing. Rachel, Rachel Easton. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You know, the outside doesn't do this house justice. Here, why don't you take a look? It's really a terrific property, one of a kind. You know, my 5:00 just stood me up, so if you want to look inside, I'd, um... Oh, I'm sure it's beautiful, but it's way out of my price range. Oh, you really should see the inside, Rachel. You know, price is always flexible. It doesn't hurt to take a peak. Come on, what do you say? Yeah, I guess it can't hurt, right? Great. Great, come on. Come on in. Oh, wow. Wow. So, it's a Dutch Revival built in 1910. As you can see, there are three bedrooms up the stairs from this grand staircase. All the wood floors are the originals. And right through here is the living room. It's beautiful. It is, isn't it? Very majestic. Ugh, let me just get some light in here. There, that's better. Oh, I would have to take all the rest of my furniture out of storage. There are so many fun things you could do with a room like this. Come here. I want to show you the room in the back. Do you like gardening? Yeah. Well, come this way. You are in for a real treat. Now this is the grand atrium. Isn't that great? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Wow. Ha! It is so special, isn't it? Oh, it's amazing. I told you. All right. do you want to take a look upstairs then? Yeah, I'd love to. OK. So all of the railings on the banister are made from birch. And this is only open staircase in the entire neighborhood. It's so great. All of the wall sconces and the light fixtures are original to the house, and they all come with the house, as well. Good. This one, in fact, is a turn of the century English bronze chandelier. Isn't it gorgeous? Yeah, really. Now the master bedroom is right through here. As you can see, there's a ton of light and lots of closet space. And right through there is the master bath. Oh, I love this. My girls and I have been sharing a bathroom for the last six - months. - Oh, you have children. Yeah, I have two daughters. It's just the three of us. So you divorced? Yeah. Well, you know what they say, home ownership is the first step to real independence. Oh, there's a bonus room in the basement I've got to show you. Follow me. OK, this is the room I was telling you about. There's a very large closet, right over here. And there's even a functioning sink with plumbing, so you could add a full bath at some point, if you would like. I wonder how long this has been up? Oh, I'm sure it's the original. It's pretty dated, if you ask me. I think it's pretty. But it does fit the room, doesn't it? [CLANG] What was that? [CLANG] Ah, well, with period homes like this, there's always a few creaks and bumps that come along with it. Just part of the charm. - Shall we? - Yeah. Oh, well, it is beautiful. But it's a lot of space. Maybe too much. Well, you know, in this market, with the economy the way it is, I'm pretty sure you can get into this house for much less than the asking. And in this neighborhood, Rachel, houses like this don't come up very often. Well, take my card and think about it, OK? - OK. - Great. It was so nice to meet you. You too, thanks. See you later. - So how was your first day? - It was good. I mean, there's a lot for me to do, but I think I can handle it. I think it's going to be good for me. Also, ahem, when I was working through the neighborhood, looking for the bus, I looked at a house. What? Wait, we're not moving, are we? No. We're not moving, Sweetie. I was just looking. But why would you be looking if you're not interested? MOLLY: Is it bigger than our apartment? Oh, it's a lot bigger, Sweetie. Well tell us about it. Wait, wait, wait. Would we have to change schools and everything? Lizzie, we're not there yet, sweetheart. And even if we were. OK, but Mom, I'm in my junior year. Honey, I know it's your junior year. And... and Molly, I mean, she has a really hard time making friends at her age. I... I don't mind. OK. You have no idea what you're talking about. But... but, Mom, this is a huge decision. And it involves everybody. Did you think about that? Of course, I did. You know, Mom, I'm... I'm done. Bye. Would I have my own room? LIZZIE: Molly, come on. So where was it? It's a couple blocks away from my work, in Ferndale. Ferndale? That's like 10 minutes away. You would be so close to us. I'd love to see the girls more often. And you got to get out of that cubicle that you call an apartment. Oh, you guys. It was so perfect. A beautiful tree-lined street. The kind of house that you dream about living in when you grow up, you know? It does need, ahem, a little work. [CLEARING THROAT] I'm not cheap. Yeah, but you would cut your big sister as break, right? He'd do It for free. Hey, don't tell her that. Aw, it doesn't matter, anyway. They would have to drop the price so much before I could even think about it. You going to keep looking? [SIGH] I don't know. Probably not. I mean, with work and everything, I'll probably just let fate decide, hm? Ew, pickles and peanut butter on a sandwich? That's disgusting. You never even tried it. And I never will. Wait a second. Phone. [PHONE RINGS] We've got to get you on a game show. Hello? Hi, Rachel? It's Stella Morgo, from Stanton Road Properties. We met a few weeks ago when you looked at a house in Ferndale. Yeah, the house. Hi, how are you? STELLA (ON PHONE): Oh, fine, fine. Hey, listen, I know that price was an issue before, so I just wanted to call and let you know that it's been reduced considerably. Really? Why did they lower the price? STELLA (ON PHONE): Well, the property was inherited, and the current owner lives in Florida now, so he just wants to sell it real quick. I see. STELLA (ON PHONE): Yeah, so I thought I would just give you a call and let you know. And see if you and your girls maybe wanted to come take another look? When? Um, you know, we'll... we'll be there today. STELLA (ON PHONE): Wonderful. How is 2:30? It's perfect. We'll see you then. Thanks. Are you serious? We're just going to look, Sweetie. And like you said, whenever we decide, we decide together. Well, I'm not moving. Hey, girls, I'm not doing this by myself. Hey. Where's Erin? I thought she was coming with you? Ah, she got held up at work. She said she's sorry, but she can't wait to come by later and see the house. Well, tell her I'm going to need some help with the whole interior design thing. I know she's got a good eye for it. Well, you can tell her yourself, when you drop me off later, in you new car. Shut up. Come on, everything's new. You got a new house. You got a new job. You need a new car. It's kind of a used new car, but still, it's a new car. I don't know what to say. Huh? How about say anything? Oh, my god. Thank you. Mm. Ah, ha, ha. Wow. This is all yours, huh? Oh, it's all mine. MARTY: I thought you said it needed a little work? Did I say a little? I don't remember saying a little. - You said a little. - What do I know? You're the contractor. - MOLLY: Uncle Marty! - Hey, hey. Molly. Where's your sister? Inside. Ah, OK. Mm, mm. You have to come and see. OK. Here we go. - OK. Here we go. RACHEL: I can't believe you gave me a car. RACHEL: I can't believe you gave me a car. MARTY: Well, you know, you kind of need a car. We can't drive you to the bus all the time, can we? Look at this. My goodness. That's pretty nice. Hey, Lizzie? LIZZIE: I'm downstairs. Ah. OK, could... could you be a little careful. I'm breaking the house. [GIGGLES] Hey. Mom, this is my room. I can feel it. Honey, there's three bedrooms upstairs, one for each of us. I know, but, I really wanted my own space. It's so far away, down here. It's awesome down here. All right, if it's what you really want. It really is. I think it's creepy. Well, fine. You can just stay upstairs. Uh, it is pretty cool. Thank you. And did you see the closet? Yes. It is a very large closet. Oh, I see lots of shoes. All my shoes, and my jeans. - Hey, what's going on here? LIZZIE: What are you doing? The wall board is totally rotted through. [SIGH] Let me see. Ugh. Wow. Look at that. It seems like there's a whole other room in there. There's a grate back there, too. MARTY: It's so weird. What? I just don't... I don't understand this wall. If they had used the original dimensions, they would have an extra foot of floor space. So what's the grate for? Ah, it could just be a plumbing chase, or something. Can you fix it? No, I can do more than fix it. We can just tear down this wall and set up a whole new room. Yeah, what kind of deal are we talking about here? Oh, I'm still thinking about it. I'll let you know. RACHEL: Oh, great. All right, you. Let's get the rest of these bags in. And you are staying for dinner, whether you want to or not. Can we order in? Oh! You're so hilarious. - Oh! - You're so hilarious. You're so hilarious. Ugh. You're so hilarious. Ugh. Bye, Mom. Have a good day. OK. Your Dad is picking you up. Hey, wait up. You know, you didn't have to drive us. Hey, it's your first day of school. I want to give you guys the royal treatment, right? And listen, you know it's OK to be nervous. - I'm not nervous. - Hm, that makes one of us. Hey, remember why I named you Elizabeth? Because of Elizabeth Bennett from... "Pride and Prejudice," which you still need to read, - by the way. - I know. And you remember what I told you about her? She was a beautiful, strong, independent woman, just like you've become. I think you should have named us both Lizzie. That would have been a little weird. Listen, you guys just be yourselves, and you'll be great, OK? - I love you. - I love you, too. - Have a good day. - Right, Mom. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] LIZZIE: You got my back? MOLLY: If you've got mine. LIZZIE: Let's do this. BELLE: So did you get finished moving in this weekend? RACHEL: Oh, the move was easy. And being five minutes from work is even better. And how are you settling in? Oh, good. - I mean, the house is terrific. - Um, hm. I feel like I can finally breathe again, you know? Hm. Still trying to get used to the idea that I've actually got a place my own. And how are the girls? Uh, Lizzie, my oldest, she has her own room now, so... So you'll see once a day until it's time for her to leave for college. If I'm lucky. You know, I have Less than two years left with her. And then... And Molly? She's good. No they're... they're both doing really well. It's just... no they're... they're fine. What is it? Oh it's nothing. I... I just worry about them. Yeah, well, you're their mom. Worrying comes with the territory. You know, when I was married, I think I worried about half as much. Well, do they see your ex? He moved to New York after we split up. So not much. But they're close. I mean, as close as they can be, considering everything that's happened. And he's a good man. It just didn't work out between us. Never, in a million years, did I think I would ever be a single mother. I just hope I can give them what they need. Yeah, well, they need to know that they're loved. And I'm sure that they do. Oh, I know you're right. I just... I just worry that I'm moving things too fast, you know? A new school, a new house, me taking this job. You do what you think is best for them. And you just gotta trust them. I'm trying. But I got to tell you, it's exhausting. I'm sure it is. MARTY: Rach! Hey, hey! Rach! RACHEL: Hey, there. You ready to get started on some demolition? RACHEL: Me, no. The girls, yes. Oh, come on, you gotta get in on this. All right. It does sound like fun. That's what I'm talking about. Ugh. Spread it out. Walk it out. Walk it out. Walk it out. OK, get back. You ready? Right, 1, 2, bring it down. [SCREAMS] Ah, very nice. Go. Go. All right. Not bad. Not bad. - Not bad, ladies. - Wow. It's a good thing that it ain't going back up. A shed this is... - Be careful. - These come down next, Rachel. - Right. MARTY: Ha, ha, ha. So I'll have to just sand this brick down a little bit. RACHEL: Is it a lot of work? MARTY: No, it's easier than it sounds. [MUSICAL CHIMES] RACHEL: Lizzie? Yeah, Mom. [KNOCKING] Hey, what are you doing? Hey, uh, I'm just, um, unpacking. What's up? I'm just checking on you. You don't have to check on me, Mom. RACHEL: Well, you just seem so far away, down here, you know? And before we were practically on top of each other. So... What's going on, Mom? I just... I mean, it's been a tough year, with everything. And, you know, you're going to be going off to college soon. - And... - In a year and a half. I know. I just want to make sure that we make the most of our time together. You know what I mean? And you may be itching to get out of here, but I'm not sure I'm ready to let you go yet. - Mom, it's gonna be fine. - I know. I... you still, um, thinking about University of Michigan? Yeah, um, but also, NYU. OK. Um, yeah, NYU is a good school, too. I just think U of M has a lot to offer for... - Mom. - OK. I get it. Just... just promise me you'll weigh all the options, OK? Of course, I promise. All right. Uh, "Pride and Prejudice." I thought it was time. You know, before I go off to college and never come home again and disappear forever. Funny. That's a funny girl, considering I love you. I love you, too. And I'll be upstairs if you need me. MOLLY: Mom, there's no towels. RACHEL: Look in my bathroom. [SCREAM] RACHEL: Molly? Molly, what happened, baby? Are you all right? What happened? OK, honey. What was it, baby? I... I... I saw something. What did you see? There... there was a girl. And... and she was... sh-sh-she was in the bathroom crying. What? What girl? Who? OK, OK. I'm here, baby. All right, let's... we'll go look together, OK? All right? See nothing. There's nobody here. Listen, you have a wonderful imagination. But you can't let it get to you, OK? Come here. Listen, you want to watch some TV before bed? OK, come on downstairs. [GASP] Come on, you guys. We gotta get moving/ You don't want to be late. Oh, how are you doing, baby? I don't like it here, Mom. Oh, honey, listen. It's a big new house, and it's going to take some getting used to, OK? But like I said last night, you let your imagination get to you like that. But something doesn't feel right. What are you guys talking about? Uh, Molly just got a scared last night, that's all. - That's not it. - What? You finally have your own room and you're complaining? I'm not complaining. Do you remember the last place we lived? Perfect storm, three women, one bathroom. You guys, we gotta go, OK? Fine. - I'll talk to her. - Thank you. Hey. Morning. Hey. We on for lunch again? Yeah. Ooh. Sorry. - Late night? - No, it's nothing. It took me a while to get Molly to sleep last night. Oh. - Good morning. - Hey. Hi. Ah, she got a little spooked last night, that's all. She thinks she saw a girl. Really? [SIGH] It's a big house. It was nothing. She's just very sensitive, and, you know, sometimes I think she gets herself so worked up, she just scares herself. Hm. What? Look, when I was a little girl, that's exactly how my parents described me. But as I got older, I started to realize that I wasn't just sensitive, that I actually have an ability to sense and see things that other people can't. So you... you think that Molly's psychic or something? BELLE: All I'm saying is that maybe she's scared of something that you don't necessarily understand. [SIGH] So now you're suggesting that my house is haunted? Rachel, Ferndale is a very old neighborhood. There's a lot of history there. Belle, you see ghosts in everything. BELLE: Only when they're there. Look, I've got to get going. But we'll do lunch. Yes. You're on. LIZZIE: You actually pay attention in class? What about your teachers? MOLLY: You know, my math teacher, he's kind of funny. What about the kids? Are they nice to you? Are you nice to them? You know, same old. I know that smile. What about the boys? What about them? Well, are there any that are cute, or that you maybe sort of like? They're seventh grade boys. They're so immature. I know, but you kind of have to get used to that. I mean, they never really do grow up. [GIGGLING] What's wrong? Did you see her? Who's there? I saw the girl, the one from before. I saw her. She was there. Molly, you have to stop freaking yourself out, OK? Now come on. She was there. Molly, come on. Lizzie! Lizzie! Lizzie! Lizzie! Lizzie! Lizzie! Lizzie! Lizzie, honey? What happened? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened? Uh, I don't know. I... I got dizzy all of a sudden. I must have fallen down. Well, OK. Just take it easy. Just sit here for a second, all right? Honey, did you see what happened? Moll? I saw the girl, again, Mom. Molly. I did. When Lizzie came in, she ran into her. I saw it. All right, honey, But... but, Mom, she was at the window and... Molly, please. Sweetheart, can you stand up? - Yeah. - All right. Just go slow, OK? Can you get some ice? Let me get you some water. Yeah, did you hit your head when you fell? [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] Oh, Molly, honey, you OK? Something's wrong. [SCREAMS] MARTY: Lizzie! LIZZIE: Please, somebody help me! Somebody get me out of here! Lizzie, open the door, honey, it's me. LIZZIE: Hurry up, please, get me out of here. Lizzie! Open the door now. LIZZIE: It's so dark. Please! - Please. - Ugh! Lizzie! LIZZIE: I can't breathe. - Please. - Lizzie! - Please. - Lizzie! - Lizzie! Honey! Lizzie! Honey! LIZZIE: Get me out of here, please! I can't breathe. I can't... Honey? Oh, god, baby. OK. OK. Mom! Oh, baby. Oh, my god. I'm here. OK. OK. PUBLIC ADDRESS: Dr. Holmes please dial extension 17. DOCTOR: Well, she lost a couple of nails. I had to put in some stitches, but there's no permanent damage. She might be in a little pain for a few days, but she'll be OK. Yeah, but why would she do something like this to herself? Well, she doesn't seem to remember what happened. And there's no clinical name for it. But I think it's safe to say Lizzie had a night terror. Uh, I don't understand. Think of it as a nightmare while sleep walking. She's never done anything like this before. Has she been experiencing any stress? Stress? Well, I mean, there's been a lot going on the last year, but we talk through everything. And she seemed OK with it. Well, sometimes teenagers her age like to keep things inside, handle things on their own. They don't like to tell Mom or Dad everything because it makes them feel weak. I can recommend a psychologist, if you would like. But you should decide together. Uh, yeah, I'll... I'll talk to her about it. Try not to worry. She seems like a very healthy young woman. It's probably just a one time event. These things usually work themselves out on their own. - She should be fine. - Can I go in and see her? Of course. She's sedated, so the best thing for her right now is to sleep. But if she has another episode, please, don't hesitate to call. OK? Thank you. PUBLIC ADDRESS: We need a technician to report to Out Patients. Any available technician, please report to Out Patients. (WHISPERING) Hey. Oh, thanks, Marty. Well, at least they're both sleeping. Mm, yeah. The doctor said her fingers are going to be fine. Good. How you holding up? Ahem, the doctor said she had a night terror. He suggested we go see a psychologist. MARTY: Well, you know, that might help. - Right? - Maybe. What scares me is, if she's this unhappy and worried, why didn't I know it? You know, why didn't she tell me. She's 16, Rach. Hey, you didn't tell Mom and Dad anything - when you were that age. - Not cause I didn't want to. You knew how Mom was always trying to make everything look perfect. She didn't want to talk about anything. I just wanted it to be different my girls. I wanted us to be able to talk and share things and know that we're always there for each other. Yeah, well, they know that. What if this is my fault. MARTY: What are you talking about? I don't know. What if I'm... what if I'm pushing all of us to move on too fast? What if she's feeling like this because of what I've done? OK, listen to me. You have done nothing wrong. OK? They are both incredible girls, and that is only because of you. Don't you ever doubt that. Look, your cooking sucks, but you're a hell of a mother, Rach. MARTY: There you go. So, honey, you know, um, if there's something bothering you that you don't feel comfortable talking with me about, you know, we could always find something else for you. You mean like a therapist? Yeah. But only if you want to. I'm fine, Mom. OK. But you know, sometimes we think we feel fine when we really don't. It's hard to know, sometimes, when you're stressed out, or... or confused, or depressed. I'm not depressed. I just had a bad dream. Do you remember what it was about? Nope, just a blur. Honey, I really think we should talk... Mom, look. I really appreciate the effort, but I just want to forget about it. OK. And everything is going to be OK, honey. Trust me. You're going to be fine. Thanks for the tea, Mom. [SIGH] RACHEL: Honey, come on, we need to let Lizzie sleep now. She wants something. Who? The girl. She wants us to know something. All right, come on. Come on. Remember when you and you used to believe in the Easter Bunny? Yeah. Only you're older, and you know that the Easter Bunny doesn't really exist, right? I'm not making anything up here. I know what I saw. OK, baby, it is gonna get better. I promise. And I'm here for both of you guys, OK? OK, Mom. Listen, moving here scares me, too. I mean, this is a really big step for all of us. So that means that we need to help each other out. Right? We just need to work together. And we're going to be fine. And I love you. I love you too, Mom. OK. That's my girl. Come here. Hm. It's gonna be all right. [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] [FOOTSTEPS] [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] LIZZIE (VOICEOVER): Let me out! Oh, I'm sorry, Belle. I think I'm going to need to take another day. I have plenty of work I can do from here. OK. How is Lizzie doing? RACHEL (ON PHONE): She's OK. Uh, you know, she slept most of the day yesterday. Um, so I think she's fine, but last night, something huh, happened to me, actually, um, that I can't explain. Tell me. RACHEL (ON PHONE): I don't know, Belle. I was late, and I think a fuse must have tripped, or something, because the lights were acting weird. And I thought I heard... BELLE (ON PHONE): What did you hear? I'm a rational person, Belle. So am I. It's just, Molly keeps talking about seeing this girl in the house. And then last night, I don't know. Rachel, every house has a past. And some more than others. Maybe you should start taking Molly seriously. LIZZIE: Mom! Listen, can we talk about this later? I'm sorry. I just, I have to go. I'm sorry. I just, I have to go. I just, I have to go. BELLE (ON PHONE): OK, sure. I just, I have to go. BELLE (ON PHONE): OK, sure. Sure but... I'm... I'm here if you need me, OK? I know. Thanks, Belle. [SIGH] Good morning. How are you doing? Good. You OK, Mom? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Did you sleep OK? Yeah, it was fine. Ah, about you? You feel better today? Yeah. I... I didn't think I could sleep that well. Oh, good. Listen, you want to take another day off from school, it's OK, No, I'm good. I've got that college adviser meeting. And... and I really should be there. - All right. - OK? - All right. - OK? - OK? - Sure. - OK? - Sure. - If you change your mind though. - I know, I'm good. I love you, Mom. - I love you. - Bye, Mom. Have a great day, you guys. - Oh, my god. - Shh. 17-year-old Greta Friedrich disappeared two days ago. According to her husband, Joseph Friedrich, Greta left the house around 8:00 PM, but never returned. Police are investigating all possible leads. Investigators speculate Greta may have run away, and are contacting friends and relatives for more information. So far, no witnesses have reported anything suspicious. STELLA: So upstairs is the master bedroom and bath, which has a walk-in shower. And then there are the closets, which, I am telling you, are to die for. Now you have two kids, right? WOMAN: Yes, a boy and a girl. MAN: Yeah. STELLA: Oh, well, this would be the perfect house to raise them. Now the house was actually built in 1925. So in the kitchen, you'll see there's authentic tile from that time period. It's absolutely beautiful. Excuse me. Oh, yeah. If... if you could just excuse me for one moment, please? - Sure. - Yes. Hello, Miss Easton, how are you? Hi. Your office told me where to find you. I need to ask you some questions. Oh, OK. Well, right now is not exactly the best time, so why don't we said something up at the office. And we can chat then, OK? Yeah, I'd really rather talk now. OK, then. Um, if you don't mind just taking a look around, I'll catch up in a bit. Thank you, so much. I... I'm working here, Miss Easton. Yeah, I know. And I'm really sorry to bother you, but I need to know if the previous owners mentioned anything about the house? Well, first of all, I never met the prior occupants. And, as I told you before, it was inherited, and I was just hired to sell it. OK. But, did you know that a girl who used to live there went missing in the '50s? What does that have to do with anything? Well, my girls and I have... been experiencing some things. Experiencing things? Yeah, like hearing and seeing things that we don't understand. OK, Miss Easton, I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at. [PHONE RINGING] I'm sorry. Give me one second, OK? Hello. Yes, this is Rachel Easton. I'm so sorry. Let's go on in and see the house. Y... yeah, I'll be right there. Thank you. These are Molly's drawings. Now she's very gifted. But as you can see, the subject matter is a bit... well, it's a bit disturbing. I tried to speak to her about them, Miss Easton, and she became very upset. She won't speak to me anymore about them. That's why I thought it best to speak with you. Oh, of course. Um, I appreciate you calling me. My concern is that in her fantasy life, there lies something very dark. And if the girl in these drawings is meant to be Molly, her feelings need be addressed. Um, absolutely. I'll... I'll have to speak with her right away. Thank you, very much. Oh, you're welcome. Molly, we have to talk about the drawings. Am I in trouble? No, Sweetie, but I need you to tell me about them. Is it the girl in the house? The girl in the house? That's what this is about? Lizzie, please. I thought you didn't believe me. Honey, I know what I said before. Molly, you're too old for imaginary friends. She's not my friend. And she's not imaginary. Look, this isn't good for you. You have to grow up. OK, Lizzie, would you just let me handle this, please? Fine, I'll be in the car. Thank you. Molly, can you tell me about the drawings, honey? I know what I said before. But it's OK. OK. You can tell me. I want to know. Is this the girl you keep seeing? Sweetheart, listen. I promise, I'm not going to get mad. She's somewhere dark. And trapped in a very scary place. And I think she wants to get out. OK, Sweetie. OK. Oh, thanks. - So this is about the house. - I don't know. All this time I've been thinking it's my fault for pushing us to get past the divorce too fast. But, I don't know. I'm starting to think maybe there is something wrong with the house. Can you tell me about the girl that Molly has been seeing? Molly says she's trapped, and trying to get out. And I... I found this in Lizzie's room. It was in an old music box. They used to live in the house. When I went to the library I saw the same picture in an old newspaper. Her name was Greta, she was 17 and an immigrant from Germany who sent here to get married. Apparently her husband was abusive. And, uh, one day she just up and disappeared. The police said she ran away, but she was never seen again. So what do you think? It's more important what you think. [GASP] I think that up until last night I didn't believe in ghosts, Belle. So this is all a little bit new to me. You don't think she ran away, do you? Well, what if she didn't? What if something or someone never let her leave? But you... you mean, like what if she's still in the house? Well, whether you believe it or not, you can't deny what you and your girls are experiencing. I know, Belle, but... She's been calling out to you and your family. It's up to you whether you decide to listen to her. So what do I do? You search the house. [KNOCKING] Hey. Hey, what's the big emergency? The girls all right? Yeah. The girls are fine. Molly is sleeping and Liz is watching a movie with Erin. What's going on? Follow me. You feel that? So what? It's a vent. You said it was plumbing chase. OK. So it's a plumbing chase. So what? So where is all this cold air coming from then? Well, where you going? I'm gonna go get my tools. Ugh! Are you going? Yeah, I'm going. I'm going. [GRUNTING] Do you see anything? MARTY: Hang on. Huh? Huh, what? What's huh? There's a wall down here. But it's really kind of sloppy. Hand me the pry bar. I'm going to see if I can break through. RACHEL: Be careful. [GRUNTING] Here, grab these. [GRUNTING] Damn. I think I see something. [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] What? What is it? Is it bad? Ha, That's, uh, yeah, that's... it's... it's pretty bad. Um, OK, I'm gonna get out of here now. So I looked into it at the library, and there was a girl who lived here and went missing in the '50s. Do you think that could be her? I couldn't say. We'll have the wait for forensics to verify it, but, uh, from the clothes we found on her, I'd say, yeah. You're pretty close to the right decade. Look, uh, I don't want to go to the gory details, but it looks like somebody walled her up in there alive. Oh, my, god. What a horrible way to die. We'll keep this quiet so there's no media circus. What's gonna happen to her now? Well, we'll open up an investigation, once the individual has been identifying and the forensics have been taken. And we'll try to contact any living relatives. Well, what if she doesn't have any relatives? Well, then, the state will handle it. Usually it's a cremation, simple burial. If this that girl that you were telling me about, I'll make sure that we take care of her. I appreciate that. Here's my number. If you have any questions just give me a call. Hey, thank you. Good evening. Well, that was fun. Oh, Marty. You know, I'm sorry. I just... it's so tragic. She was so young. Ah, are you really sure that this was the girl? [SIGH] If Belle was right, then she should be at peace now, and everything should go back to normal. You know, I never thought of you as the spiritual type, sis. Me either. Listen, um, don't say anything to the girls, OK? I mean, it's a pretty big secret. No, it would terrify them, Marty, OK? Nobody needs to know anything. We just need to put it behind us, and move on. OK? OK. It's your call. Yeah. Good night. Thank you. Bye. Yay. MOLLY: Bye, Uncle Marty. MARTY: Bye, sweetie. RACHEL: Thanks, again. ERIN: Bye. ERIN: Bye. - I hope you guys didn't mind I hope you guys didn't mind No, it was fun. LIZZIE: All's good. Uncle Marty's the best, right? - Yes. RACHEL: Sure. So, I was thinking we could make this a girls day. What do you think? Do a little shopping. You want to look cool for school, right? Yay. Yes, and Molly wants to not do her homework. - Always. - All right, ladies. Let's spend a little money. LIZZIE: Yeah. MOLLY: Ha, ha. Woo hoo. RACHEL: All right, girls, let's see what we got. LIZZIE: Hey, I'm gonna go grab my heels. They'll go great with this dress I just bought. RACHEL: Oh, yeah, OK. Um, just come up when you're done. I want to see it all put together. LIZZIE: OK. Come on, honey. There's nothing to be scared of, OK? I promise. Come on, I want to see you in a new outfit in under five minutes, kiddo. LIZZIE: I'm almost ready. Be there in a second. I have waited so long for this moment. When I would finally be free of this house. It's my turn now. You're so beautiful. You're mine! [SCREAM] Molly, what's wrong? You OK? Uh, I thought I heard something. Well, honey, everything's fine now. Don't you just love it? Oh! Isn't it beautiful? No, you are beautiful. Do I look really nice, Mother? Yes, you do, daughter. That's pretty. Did you get that today? It's a friend's. She let me borrow it. I might have to borrow it from you. We'll see. Come on, Molly. Ha, ha, ha. Come on, Sweetie. [THUNDER] [THUNDER] [KNOCKING] Thank you for coming. Hey. Ooh. Come on in. So, I found this last night. Hm? What is happening, Belle? How old did you say Greta was when she died? 17. Yeah. I believe she's drawn to Lizzie. She sees in her the life she didn't have a chance to live. But I... I thought we took care of this when we found the skeleton. I know. You know, sometimes things don't always work out the way we want 'em to. So she's still here? Yeah. I can feel her. The spirit here is restless, and very angry. [SIGH] So what do we do? We send her away. I thought you said that this was all over. That everything would go back to normal. Yeah, I thought it would too, but it didn't, OK? OK. I still think you should tell them. Marty, I told you I don't want them to know. MOLLY: Don't want us to know what? You found a skeleton in my room? Yeah. And we thought we had it taken care of. But I realized last night that she's still in the house. Well, we can't say there anymore. We have to move, right, Molly? You don't want to stay there, now. I'm scared, Mom. Honey, I know. I know it's scary. And I know we've been through a lot. But it's almost over. OK. Belle is going to help her move on. She's there now? Yeah, she is. And she's going to free the girl's spirit? She's going to try. What if she can't? Then we cross that bridge when we come to it. Listen, guys, I'm... I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I should have. But this is our home. And I want us to fight to stay there. But I can't do it alone. We're a family. You're never alone. Moll? Greta, I'm a friend. I've come to set you free. You were trapped and I will release you. You were lost, and I'll set you on your path. It's time for you to leave this family in peace. And by the time I'm finished on this night, no spirit shall live in this home. Oh, you scared me, Lizzie. I'm sorry, Molly. Your hair is so pretty, Molly. I could braid it for you tomorrow. Would you like that? Thank you. We can't go back to that house, Molly. You know that, right? We're going to have to move. We're going to have to work together to convince Mother. You understand, right? We're going to have to be a team. I... I understand. Come on, Sweetie, we're starting the movie. Lizzie is not Lizzie. We need to go home now, Mom. We're starting. Everything OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. Is it OK if I go lay down for a little bit? I'll come down later. Yeah, of course, baby. It's going to be OK. - Are you ready? - Yeah. You're confused, Greta. You need to find your way to the higher plane. Don't be scared, Greta. Don't be scared. MAN (ON TV): What the hell is that? MAN (ON TV): Well, exactly what are you looking for? WOMAN (ON TV): It's not what I've been looking for. And I strongly suggest we go back, find another way. WOMAN (ON TV): I'm with Catherine. MAN (ON TV): Wait a minute, wait a minute. Catherine, wait a minute. It's too late to walk. WOMAN (ON TV): That's true. MAN (ON TV): I think we should just keep quiet. It'll be dark soon. We just don't have the time. WOMAN (ON TV): Where's the Marshall? You have no right to [INAUDIBLE]. Molly? Moll? Molly. Molly! Molly? Molly? Molly's gone. MARTY: What? Rachel, what? RACHEL: She's gone. MARTY: What... what are you... what are you talking about? RACHEL: She's gone, Marty. Why would she do something like that? - I don't know. MARTY: Wait a minute. Are you... did she say anything to you? No. I mean, she did but not... oh, my god. Wait a minute. Where are you going? Rach? Mastah spirit. Find your way. Leave this home and go in peace. Ascend to the higher plane. GHOST: Stop! Ascend lost spirit. GHOST: Please, please don't do this. Ascend. GHOST: Don't listen to it. There's a better place waiting for you. GHOST: Please, don't do this. Please. You are not welcome here. Stop! I'm not who you think I am. No! Lizzie, you pushed her too hard. Here you go. Thanks, I'll be fine. RACHEL: You sure? You sure you don't want to go the emergency room? No. No. I'll be OK. You gave me quite a fright young lady. I'm sorry you hurt your head. Ah, it's just a bump. But what I really want to know is why you came back home? Because, I didn't want you to send Lizzie away. Lizzie? Your... your sister, Lizzie? She's the one who pushed you. I don't understand. I tried to tell you, Mom. I know, you did, baby. But I'm listening now, OK? Lizzie's not Lizzie. The girl at Uncle Marty's is someone else, inside Lizzie. Lizzie's spirit is here in the house. RACHEL: How do you know this? Because Lizzie told me, mom. Before you got here. You have to believe me. RACHEL: Is she talking to you now? No. She's scared, Mom. She so scared. She doesn't want to be trapped here, like Greta was. And it was Lizzie's spirit that sent you the message in the book. How? I thought you said... BELLE: I know. I know, and I'm so sorry. I thought that by finding the bones you would be able to set her free, but instead, for some reason, it's just given her the power to take Lizzie over. So what am gonna do? All right. Look, Rachel, I know you're scared, but, there is something that you can use against Greta. There's nothing more powerful than the bond between a mother and child. You're going to have to use that bond to get Lizzie back. Good morning. How's Molly? She's fine, Sweetie. Where did she go last night? We just had a little fight. That's all. but we talked everything out, and everything is fine. So listen, I was thinking you and I could spend the day together. How's that sound? Go grab some breakfast, and then maybe look at some houses for sale. Really? Yeah, I mean, I know Belle said that whatever was in house is gone now, but I'm beginning to think, maybe you and Molly are right. Time for a fresh start. Thank you. Thank you, so much. Sure, Sweetie. I just want us all to be happy. LIZZIE: What are we doing here? Oh, I forgot to tell you, Uncle Marty wanted to borrow that old trunk of mine. It will just take a second. He wants me to bring it over today. Can you help me carry it? It's a little heavy. Honey, it's fine. We're gonna be quick in and out, OK. It will just take a second. OK. Come on. It's upstairs in my room. Honey, do you remember why I named you Lizzie? Of course, I do, Mother. Could you tell me? Uh, be... because of, uh, um, You don't know, do you? My daughter knows. What are you talking about? I love you, Lizzie. I love you, too, Mother. Honey, I need to be strong for me, now. You hear me? I'm right in front of you, Mother. I'm sorry it took me so long, baby, but now I need you to fight. I need your help. I need you to fight to come back to me. You're beginning to scare me, Mother. Well, it's about time, Greta. And I'm not your Mother. Lizzie, I know you're here honey. Let go of me. Lizzie, Lizzie, I need you to fight, baby. I'm not leaving her. Please, I need you to fight. You'll never get her back. Never. Leave my family alone! Lizzie, come back. Mom? Lizzie? No! Lizzie! No! Oh, my god! Lizzie! No, ba... baby. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Breathe, honey, come on. Come on, honey. Come on, breathe, honey! Please, breathe. Come on. Come on, please. Don't leave me yet, baby. Please. I'm not ready to let you go yet. [CHOKING] Lizzie? Lizzie? Lizzie, are you all right? Mom? You named me Elizabeth... Mm hm. Because she was strong. Baby, that's right. Yes, she was strong like you. MARTY: I still can't believe the bank just bought it back so fast. RACHEL: Ha! It was either that or a lawsuit, and I made it clear they didn't want to mess with me. Yeah, no. I wouldn't want to mess with you. Ha, ha, ha. Come on, guys. MOLLY: We're coming. That the last of it? MOLLY: Yep. So you guys excited for the new place? Ha! The only thing we care about it that it was built last year. Me and Lizzie are sharing a room again. Yeah, somebody's got to watch your back. STELLA: Isn't it beautiful? ERIN: It's got great curb appeal. It does. You're kidding? STELLA: So it's a Dutch Revival. It was built in... Be nice. I just to let them know. Excuse me, could I speak to you for a second. Excuse me. MAN: Oh, well, why don't you guys go ahead? I'll catch up over here. Hi. could I talk to you for a second? Hi. I know this might seem a little crazy, but my family and I recently lived in this house and I just thought it was fair to let you know that it was haunted. Haunted? Yeah, and I know how this sounds, but, um, I'm legally obligated to let you know, so there you go. But don't worry, we dealt with it. We had the house properly cleansed. OK. Cleansed? Yeah, cleansed, you know. Released the spirit, sent her to a higher plane. It should be fine now. Well, I appreciate the head's up, but we don't believe in ghosts. You should. - What did she want, honey? - Oh, it's nothing. I just think she's, uh, a little messed up in the head. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. Shall we? Would you mind me asking if you have children? WOMAN: We do. Two teenage girls. STELLA: Oh, well, I think you'll agree, this is a perfect home to raise a family. ERIN: Feels like home. [MUSIC PLAYING]
