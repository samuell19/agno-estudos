- Yep, just got here. Remember what I told you. - I know, I know. No loud music, no parties, no boyfriends. Boyfriends are okay. - Boyfriends are okay? Now that I don't have a one. I'll keep that in mind. The key should be under the mat. - Cool. Oh, got it. You know, the girls are really gonna miss you this weekend. I wish you could go camping with us. Yeah, I'm bummed about it too. But hey, we'll still have the summer camp. - Can't wait, Sis. Oh, hey, my flight is boarding. I gotta go. - Okay, have fun, be safe. Oh, and one last thing. Watch out for ghosts. - Very funny. Watch out for very tall buildings. Love ya, bye. - Love ya, freak. - Hey, whatta you doing? Yeah, yeah, I'm at Tina's. Come over. Cool. Oh, Nina! Pick up some vodka on your way. Peach, of course. Okay, see ya in a bit. Bye. - Mommy, come play with me. Come play with me, Mommy. - Here I come! - Yes, but I need it officially recorded on file. I'm gonna need you to come in here and let me tape you. No, telling me over the phone won't do me any good. Yes, Miss Ash, we're on the same side here, remember? - Detective Thompson? There is a lady here to see you. He's back! - Are you okay? It's all right. Can you look at me, please? Yeah. - What happened? - It was, it was Cameron. Cameron Crowe. - Cameron? Are you sure? - He tried attack me, he tried to kill me. Are you sure it was him? Yes. Tell me what happened. Please, calm down. Just tell me what happened. - James, thank you for coming in early. No problem. This is Miss-- - Joyce Moscone. Yes, we've met before. So Joyce, what is it this time? - This, this time it was different. - Really? Unlike the time you said that your doors were opening and closing on their own? Or unlike the time when you said someone was coming in your house and blowing out the candles? It's called wind, Joyce. Try closing your windows, and poof, your ghosts will magically disappear. - James. Don't you think you're being a bit insensitive? - She tragically lost her daughter in a school shooting two years ago. Ever since then she's been conjuring up these experiences, none of which have ever panned out. - Let's just check out her story. - We've checked out every story. Last month she said someone was following her. It turned out it was a postman named Henry Anderson delivering his route. - She swore it was her daughter's killer. - Cameron Crow? He's been dead for 18 months now. They picked him up in pieces with a shovel. - Yes, I've read the case. But didn't he wait 14 or so years to take revenge on those two bullies from the elementary school he had a grudge against? - So what are you saying? - The report never included any solid evidence to prove the the remains in that factory were actually Cameron Crowe's. What I'm saying is there might be a remote chance that he's still alive. And considering his track record for holding grudges, he may be back to settle the score with all those who were involved, including you James. - She's just a kook. - Well, I'm still gonna check out her story. - You go ahead and do that. Just don't go sounding off any alarms yet. Even though Tina is off covering the L.A. Earthquake, her sister Tammy is staying at her place until she gets back, And I don't want her panicking. So, in the remote chance that you uncover something, you come to me first. Thank you. - You guys, I can't believe Halloween is in a couple of days. I'm so excited. - Ooh, look out for Michael Myers. - The guy from Austin Powers? - No, that would be Mike Myers. This is Michael Myers from the very famous Halloween movie franchise. Not withstanding Halloween 3, which was a total disaster, but such is my opinion. - I hate scary movies. - Which is unfortunate, because they are the only ones worth watching. - Nah, I'll take a romantic comedy any day. - Hey guys, remember the last time we all sat around like this? It was at Briana's Valentine's Day Party, and there was a killer running around town killing everybody. - Oh, way to go Bella. You always know like exactly when to choose your topics. - But God, I'm just saying. - Wait? What are you guys talking about? - How long has it been since you moved here? - Six months. - And nobody told you? - Told me what? - There's this kid. He went to elementary school with us. He had a huge crush on Tina, I mean huge crush. Anyway, there was these bullies, Jimmy Garcia and Emilio Sanchez. They beat him up so bad right in front of her. It must have traumatized him so much that we never saw him ever ever again. - That's horrible. - Now fast forward 14 years, he goes back to our old elementary school, shoots the bullies, and in the process he kills other children and a teacher. - Ironically, when the freak came back, he got a job posing as a cameraman at Tina's TV station. He even worked side-by-side with her on the same school shooting. - And get this, Jimmy and Emilio, He catches up to them later, he waits till the right moment, then slaughters them - Argh. right in a dark alley, and he left their bodies there to rot. - Oh my God! - God only knows who else he coulda killed if it wasn't for Tina's detective work. Get this, she finds where he lives, breaks into his house, waits for the psycho to come back and stabs him with his own machete. - I still don't understand how he escaped. After she stabbed him, she said he fell to the ground bleeding. But by the time the police got there to get his body, he was gone. And you know what I think the creepiest part was? The only thing he took with him was his mask. - That's creepy. So whatever happened to him? - They found his body a few months later. It was burnt beyond recognition in some old factory in Chico. - Wow, what a way to go. - Are you okay? Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Are you sure? I'm okay. Sorry. - Hello? Yes. Oh my gosh, is she okay? Can I speak to her? Okay, I'm on my way, thank you. Okay guys, it's my mom. She's been in a accident, and I really need to be there. I'm going with you. - No, no, no, no. You guys stay, enjoy the trip. They said it's not that serious, she just needs me there, okay? That's fine. - Well, I hope your mom's okay. - I hope so too. - Let one of us go with you. - Oh, I'll be fine. - Alright, take care. - I'll be fine. - You guys have fun. Okay, have fun. - Hope everything's okay. - I'm going with you. Bree, I don't like this. - Don't worry about it. I'll text you when I get there, okay? I'll be fine, okay? - Okay. Alright, okay. Okay. Be safe. - I will, I'll be fine. - Let me know. - I would like to remind our viewers that we have Joyce Moscone exclusively on KBNC. She says that she has had first hand contact with Cameron Crowe, the same killer that plagued this town almost two years ago. Yes, that's right. He attacked me on the playground, he tried to kill me, but something stopped him. - Something? Not someone? - Well, if there was someone, I didn't see anyone. Every time he tried to get close to me, something blocked him. - Fascinating! - You shoulda been there. It was something out of a horror movie. - Now, you've had face to face contact with this same suspect in the past, correct? - Yeah, um. I mean, I guess you can say that. 'Cause, a couple years ago, after the school incident, I accidentally hit him with my car and when I went back to the car to call for help he was gone. He just up and left. All was left was this pool of blood right there on the street. - Well, surely this story isn't over. What would you like say to the citizens of Santa Carla? - Beware out there, neighbors. Beware! He's back! - Powerful words. Well, you heard it here first. I'm Anita Smith with KBNC in Santa Carla. Now, back to. - Michelle, this is Detective Nicole Thompson. Any minute now, you're gonna be receiving a lot of calls asking about a killer on the loose in our town. I want you to tell 'em we're on top of it. And if you get any leads, forward 'em to Officer Marshall. Damn it, Joyce! Ingenious. He chooses a victim similar to his build and height, burns him beyond recognition, then waits to return on Halloween, no less, wearing a mask. God, please help us with what terror you have planned for our town. - Okay, I'll see you at eight tonight, and then we'll pick up Lucas and Bella, yeah? - Okay. - Yay, okay. - Bye. Bye! - Hello? Hello? Lucas, we're here. Lucas? - Lucas, where are you, Dude? Quit fooling around. Oh my God! Lucas! Oh my God! - What happened? Jesus Christ, what did you do? - Oh my God, Lucas! - Wake up! Oh my God, Lucas! Call 911! Wake up! - What the hell? - You jerk! Seriously? Lucas! - Ooh, look at me, look at me. Help me, help me! - What the hell is wrong with you? - Oh my God. - What, it's funny. - You know I don't like this shit! - That's not funny. - Come on, it's funny, come on. - No, it wasn't. - Just for that, you're driving yourself to the party. Help me, help me! Asshole. Oh God, oh man. Oh, my gosh, oh gosh. I'm so glad I got this thing recorded. Dude man, this thing is bound to go viral. Oh Lucas! Wake up Lucas! Oh my God. I know you guys were gonna change your mind. Whoa big boy! Aren't you a little too big to be trick or treatin'? Man, look at you. You got the whole outfit on. You got the machete, the blue jumpsuit. Who are you supposed to be Jason's cousin? - Oh my God, this is my favorite. - This is my favorite, but that's really good too. - I like those too, I'll trade you. Traded! - Oh my God, dude, is that real? - I think so! - Help us, someone please help us! He's after us, he's gonna kill us! - Freaking pranksters! Oh, man. - Yeah, I'm almost ready. I'm just getting this load ready for right now. Um, you know what? Yeah, I'll see ya out there. Yeah, okay, bye. Hey, Jumbo! Chip chop, chip chop. Come on, time is money. - Nobody bullies my son and gets away with it. No way. They must all pay for their sins. You hear me? Maybe not today, tomorrow, or even next week, but some day. Don't you ever forget it. I want you to make a mental image of who those two boys are. And whoever wrongs you. And when good and ready, you do what you have to do, son. You do what you have to do. Are you listening? Someone needs to rid society of this evilness. 'Cause you sure as hell can't count on the public school system to do anything. Not my son. Go on and eat. Eat, son. So you can grow to be big and strong. That's right, eat. - Come on, time is money. There are babies for you to eat down the street. Out of the way, come on. I don't have all fucking night. - You should have just let him keep walking. - Yeah, I should have just let him keep walking. Hey, keep going, Playboy, that's right, keep walking. Nice hoodie. Maybe some Jujubes. Maybe you should buy him some candy. I can see you two are very close friends at this point. God damn. - Alright, let's see. Ooh, this looks like a nice secluded spot for you. Shall we get this show on the road? - So what do you want? A CBJ, a BBBJ, half and half, or the full service? - Baby, I want the whole menu. All of column A, and most of column B. - $300 - $300? What happened to 80 bucks? - Inflation! Do you want it or not? - I just wanted to pay toll for the tunnel, I didn't wanna buy the fucking thing. Fine. 300 bucks. - Did you hear that? Hear what? I heard something. - It's nothing. It's a God damned cat. It's a hobo that's just waitin' for the show. So just. - There's somebody out there. - What now? Why are you stopping again? - I don't like it, go out and check. - Go out and check. You mean, right now? - No, tomorrow! - Great, you know what, you know what? Stop the fucking meter. Because I'm not paying for this. Maybe it's your sense of self respect that's out there. Maybe, I don't know, I'll look. Yeah, I'm gonna go and check. somewhere out there, just for you, just for you. - Did you find out what it was that was making the noise? We're takin' it to the backseat, are we? Probably be more comfortable back there anyways. Oh Shit! Come on, start damn you. Finally! You stupid mother, yeah stand right there. I'm gonna fucking. - Well, looks like it's gonna be a Netflix kinda night. Alright, Tina, whaddya have to munch on? Whoa! Who are you? - You can see me. - Of course I can see you. - I'm Olivia. - How did you get in here? Where did you come from? Who are you, the neighbor's kid or something? Look, Tina's not here. I'm staying here until she gets back. So if you wouldn't mind going back home? - I can help you, you just have to ask. - Huh? Fuck this! - Fuck. - Here. God damn! - Watch your head! - That shit fucking hurt! - Dad, I've been trying to get a hold of Briana since yesterday, and she's not responding. And I can't get a hold of Bella either. - I'm sure they're okay. Just give 'em a little bit more time. I'm sure they'll show up soon. - They've never not responded to my text or calls. I'm really getting worried. I wanna file a missing person's report. - Now Honey, don't you think you're being a bit haste? - Let me see, I'm losing my friends one by one and there's a psycho killer running around town. No, I don't think I'm acting in haste. - Well, we can't file a missing person's report until 24 hours have passed, or unless you're a family member. - Oh, that's right. You hafta give the kidnapper a 24-Hour head-start. I forgot! I guess I'll give it a couple more hours. - Tell you what, why don't you call Detective Nicole Thompson. She's leading the investigation. She might have some information for you. - Alright, thanks dad. Cameron? Is that you? Ow! Cameron! Nathan! Whatever the hell your name is! What did you do with my friends, Cameron? Where are my friends? Cameron? Oh my God, oh my God. - Excuse me? Who? - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else. - No, it's okay. - Sorry. The hell? - You holding up okay? Hey Sandy, send that to the lab for fingerprints and anything else they can find. - And tell 'em to put a rush on that. - You got it. - Honey, maybe it's just better that you move back home and forget about this house-sitting stuff. At least until this whole thing blows over. - Yeah, I'll pack my things. I just don't understand what does he want from me? - It's not you. See, he came here expecting to find Tina. He doesn't know that Tina's away. But when you chased after him-- - Which was a very foolish thing to do. - He realized you weren't Tina and decided to split. Just think of it this way, it's kind of a mixed blessing in retrospect. You're here, and you're safe. - Whatever it was, my friends are still missing and no one gives a shit. - Tammy. - Tammy, look I know how concerned you are about your friends. I don't blame you whatsoever. I'd feel the same way. So, if it's okay with you James, I'd like to bring Harmony over to the apartment tomorrow to see what clues she can find. - Here? - Yes, here. She works best at the scene of the crime. - It's certainly worth a shot. - Look, Harmony is a medium. I don't know if you're familiar, but it's kinda like a psychic, she doesn't use all the gadgets, though. She helped us on a missing person's case a while back. Maybe you can help her answer a few questions in regards to your friends. - Sure, I wanna help. - Thank you. I'll pick you up before coming. We're gonna get him. We'll get him. - It's so nice to have you back. - Thanks Mom. - I really wish Tina would move back with us too. - I doubt that's gonna happen, Mom. She couldn't wait to get her own place. - Well, it's free rent and always hot food on your plate. Honey, I'm about to tell you something that may be long overdue. And it's something I never discussed with you or your sister because I didn't think it was gonna affect you. And I don't know how else to tell you, so here goes. You, we have a gift. - A gift? - Yes, it's a very special and rare gift. And I need you to listen to me with an open mind. You have the ability to channel the spirits of those who have passed. Now, you can choose to ignore them or you can choose to accept them and utilize them. The choice is up to you. - Oh my God mom, you're telling me this just now? - Honey, I swear I thought it skipped your generation. I mean, your great-grandmother had it, but your grandmother didn't have it. Or at least she never told me she had it. And I have it, and now it looks like you and Tina have it. It's a very rare and powerful tool. But first you need to learn how to use it. - So that's what was at camp and at Tina's Apartment. You know, one of the little girls from the Westside Elementary School shooting and the teacher, they appeared to me on multiple occasions. And they scared the hell out of me. But I didn't tell anyone because I was scared everyone would think I was a nutcase. - Well, you know, that's a common concern among us. It's such a rare power that the vast majority of people will never be able to comprehend it. - Well, how do I learn how to use it. - Now that's what I wanna hear. Well, mainly through practice. You have to concentrate on the spirit that you want to attract and connect with. It's easiest if it's someone that you knew personally, or you met them at some point. Now, I can connect with spirits simply by talking to their loved ones. But some other ways of doing that would be touching a picture of them, or some of their belongings, like a shirt or a hat or something like that. And then when you learn to attune your frequency with theirs, they will no longer scare you. - You know, Tina told me about this, but I didn't believe her. So you're saying that I can conjure up someone's spirit right here, right now? - Yes, with some practice. But Honey, save it for when you really need it. - And I can ask them to do anything? - Yeah, within reason. - Holy shit. Tammy! - Time applied for you, Cameron. You want Tina? You're gonna get Tina. - Harmony, hi. Hello. Please, come in. - Oh, it's so good to see you again. You too. Thank you. - Hi. - You must be James' younger daughter, Tammy. - She's good. - There's definitely some very strong energy here. Definitely very strong. What's behind this? There's something dangerous behind this frame. No, no, no, no. Not that kind of danger. This kind of danger. The spirits can be of no help to us unless we ask them for help. In order to establish direct communication, we must know who it is we need to ask help from. For you see, the spirits of the deceased are around us all. Almost everywhere we go. - You mean they're walking amongst us? - No, not really, they sort of drift along their plane of existence. However, they cannot affect the world in which they once lived, what we would call reality. But they can guide us through our thoughts and emotions. Have you ever given a second thought to something and then decided against it? Ever hesitated to do something? That's them. What you and I would call intuition or hunches. We all have it, the difference between you and me is that I have aligned myself to be in harmony with them. Very well. Shall we begin? I'm receiving vibrations from. From one. Two. Three. Three, three distinct energy sources. - Oh my God. Are these energies always from the dead? - No. No, not always. If two living people are simultaneously thinking of each other, then the spirits are aligned and both of them will be able to feel each other. There's somebody here. It's one of the three energy sources. - Who? Briana, Bella, Lucas? Where are they? - It's an energy field, but white energy. - White energy? - Pure energy. Young energy. - Olivia? Olivia, if you're here, I need your help. I need to find my friends. Briana, Bella and Lucas are missing. Do you know where they are? Do you know what happened to them? Please, please help us. - What's going on? - We've made contact. - Well, we know it's an old house in the hills somewhere with a creek nearby, but we're in the valley, it could be any one of these hills. - Ho ho ho ho, you're all fucked. Every one of ya. He's back and he's pissed. - Shut up and get the fuck outta here. - Oh yeah, I'll get outta here. At least I know he ain't coming for me. - Anything? - No, it's just Kristy requesting a meet up. Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't think of this before. - What? - This app we all have on our phones. - A phone app? - Yeah, this app called Approach Me. We all use it whenever we wanted to meet somewhere. It tells us exactly where each other is to the others on this scope. See, Kristy is in that direction. And as I move closer to her, it'll tell me how close she is to me. And if her position moves, well, so does it on the scope. - Hmm. - Now, all I have to do is set up a meet up and I'll get to know where they are. Okay. - What? What's happening? Oh, there's someone! - That's just Zack, see? - How long does it usually take to connect? - Usually within seconds, but the only thing is that they have to accept my invite to connect. - Hmm, so much for that. I can help you. You just have to ask. - Olivia! Olivia! Olivia, please help me. I need you now. If you can hear me or feel my vibrations, I need you to do one thing for me. Please accept my Approach Me app invite, on Bella, Briana, and Lucas' phone. Please, please do it now. That's weird. - What is? - They're all coming from the same location. Mount Diablo. We're getting close. - Tammy! Are you OK? What the hell just happened? - Sorry, I'm fine. - Are you sure? You've gotta keep it together, Tammy. - You're supposed to help me, not scare the shit out of me. - Okay, you don't have to do this if you don't want to. - No, I'll be fine. You'll wanna make a right at the next intersection. Shouldn't you be calling for back-up? I sure will. Just as soon as I find a shred of evidence, I'll have this place swarming with cops. - It looks like it's right up this hill. Up there. - Look, Tammy, before we go in here, I wanna make sure one thing's clear, alright? You understand my job is on the line, right? I shouldn't be bringing you here. I understand that you care about your friends, and I wanna help you, I just wanna make sure that you're gonna follow my orders from here on out. - Okay. - Remember how to use the radio in case of emergency? - Yeah, my dad taught me how to do it. - Great, you might need it. Don't freak out, but you know, we gotta cover all bases here. - I understand. - All right. Let's go. - Tina! - Shh! - Oh my God! Tina! Tina! Oh my God! Oh my God, Tina! - So happy to see you. - Oh my God, what has he done to you? - He's gonna be back. - Who? Who's gonna be back? Cameron. - Where did he go? - Oh my God. - Did he have anybody with him, Tina? - We gotta get you outta here. Come on, let's go. Shit! It's locked. - Let me see. - Oh my God, Briana, you're alive! Oh my God. - Tammy, Tammy, Tammy. - No. - Go to the car, call for backup, and tell 'em our location. Now! - Okay, okay, okay. Shh! We're gonna get you outta here. Briana, we're gonna get you outta here, okay? Shh! Tina, Sweetie, Tina. Are you alright? Are you okay? You're freezing! We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Try to keep it together as much as you can, okay? Shake your head. Freeze! You sick fuck. Put your hands behind your head and get on your knees. I said put your fucking hands behind your fucking head and get on your fucking knees. Now! You see this! This is pointed directly at the back of your fucking head. I have no problem shooting you fucking now and asking questions later. I'm not gonna fire a warning shot. Do what I say. I'm gonna count to three. One. Two. Say goodbye, asshole! Fuck! No! - Cameron Crowe! - Tammy, no. Ah! Argh. - Bella, help us. - Ahh! - Detective Thompson! Detective Thompson! You won't believe what happened. He did it again. He's gone. He's gone, we have to see. - No. No. You gotta be fucking kidding me. - You have to see. * This little light of mine * I'm gonna let it shine * This little light of mine * I'm gonna let it shine * This little light of mine * I'm gonna let it shine * Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine * Hide it under a bushel, no * I'm gonna let it shine * Hide it under a bushel, no * I'm gonna let it shine - It's fucking foam! * Hide it under a bushel, no * I'm gonna let it shine - It's fucking foam! * Let it shine, * let it shine, let it shine - It's a damn fucking toy! * I won't let Satan blow it out * I'm gonna let it shine - There were three Fucking masks! * Won't let Satan blow it out * I'm gonna let it shine * Won't let Satan blow it out * I'm gonna let it shine * Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine * Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine * I'm gonna let it shine * Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine * Abide with me * Fast falls the eventide * The darkness deepens - Are you ready? * Lord - Yeah, just give me one second. * With me abide - We don't have a second.
