When we take it upon ourselves to act against our best interests... ...and the best interests of our community, we have to understand that there are consequences for those actions. And we must respect the hierarchy of power as it is handed down to us from God. I did not ask for this responsibility. I did rise to power under my own volition, but the drive to do so was placed inside of me by a higher power. Jimmy... It's God's will that I stand here today... to take a hard look at your lives, people. You believe that anything happens without the will of God. If it were God's will that He wanted one of you - to be in charge... - Hey, Briggs. ...do you not think He would have given you the drive? Keep a sharp eye out for the brother. Boss thinks he might try something. He did not. God blessed me with the means and the mental fortitude to grow my interests in this community. Not only was I able to open up Clark's Mercantile and Trade, but I was able to lure in the railroad. Now I know that many of you do not agree with my methods. Let me assure you Mister McCallister here's had every opportunity to do right by this community, but he's flat out refused. Jimmy... you go on home, now. Don't stay here and watch this. You hear me, son? You go on home! Go! "James," is it? Do you understand what's happening here today? Well, your father is teaching you a valuable lesson. Go home! Go! Know your place. He stole from me. Yes, he did. Yes, he did! He stole from all these good people. That makes him a sinner. You know where in the world sinners go? I can tell you. Sure as hell ain't Wyoming. Let him hang. Shoot the wagon driver. Pa! Get Briggs! Please help me! Dad, you okay? Briggs... help me... Get the doc. You owe me more. - You okay? - Yeah. Bobby... Oh, God, no. Paid in full. You killed my brother, you son of a...! Have to get these hung early so they have a chance to dry before the wind gets up. Are you gonna help me or just keep watching? I like watching you. Yeah? You like watching me hang laundry? I like watching you do most things. Most things I do, I do for you. That's true. Suppose that might be why you like watching me. I reckon I'd enjoy watching you do other things. Not just things for me. Like when I do things for our daughter? Yes. You're a good mother. Anyone can see that. Thank you. Now, I need you to be a good father today and walk our daughter to school. Oh, no. She's old enough to walk herself. She needs you. I need you. And I can't walk her today since the wind is probably gonna get up and I need to finish hanging this laundry. I have to open the store. Then the two of you best get going so you're not late. Brooke! You need to hurry. Your father's walking you to school today. Why can't you walk me? Brooke. Yes, sir? Listen to your mother. Thank you. Brooke, I have too many chores to get done this morning. So no arguing. Grab your school books and scoot before you're both late. I think you and your father could use a little walk together anyway. Go on. - We should have taken the horse. - No. There wasn't time to saddle the horse and walk you to school and be back at the store on time to open. - Wouldn't we be faster on the horse? - Undoubtedly. Then wouldn't the time we save by being faster have made up for the time it would have taken to saddle the horse? No. "No classes today as Miss Valerie has taken ill." What do you think she's ill with? Pox? It's probably pox. You need to walk home now. I have to open the store. Mama says I'm not allowed to walk home alone. That's nonsense. You say I should listen to Mother. This is different. Mama wouldn't like it if you made me walk home alone. Sit there and finish your studies. I finished my studies. The teacher needs to assign new ones. Then sit there and read a book. Good morning, Mister Jeffries. Good morning, Mister Briggs. - How's your day? - Very well. How can I help you? Well, I'll tell you, Mister Briggs. My mother done got it in her head yesterday that she wanted to bake a cake for the church potluck this weekend. And now last year, she made a pie, but the apples she used grew on Mister Johnson's apple tree. You know, the one out back by the outhouse? And wouldn't you know it, them apples tasted plum-like shit and made anybody who eat them sick to they gut. I tell ya', I think the shit from that outhouse has soaked down to the root and changed the way a basic apple can taste. But Mister Johnson says that's a bunch of hooey, and because of that, he won't let Mama have no more apples for her apple pie, which, as far as I'm concerned, is fine by me and Mama because as I mentioned before, the apples taste like shit anyhow. Well, that left a dilemma for Mama. She's not going to bake pie for this week's potluck. What could she possibly make? A cake. Exactly. Mama's gonna bake a cake. Bring it to the church potluck after church on Sunday. Was there something that you needed from the store, Mister Jeffries? There I go, blundering on around about Mama. I done forgot you don't know why I'm here. Mama needs some flour. The sack she has is full of weevils and she don't think she can sift them all out this time. How many pounds? Just a 20-pound bag'll do. I didn't, uh, I didn't see you there. I wasn't really gonna steal 'em. It's just a game I play with your daddy. Twenty pounds of flour. That'll be one dollar and a nickel. Yeah, could you apply it to my mother's account? - Of course. - Thank you, Mister Briggs. Hope to see you at the luncheon on Sunday. Madam. Have you finished reading your book? He tried to steal some jelly beans. - What? - That man. Mr. Jeffries? I caught him taking some jelly beans and he put them back. He put them back? He did. I'll discuss this with him next time he's in my store. You want one? No. Then what do you want? His hands were dirty. Pardon me, ma'am. I didn't mean to frighten you. We weren't sure if anyone was home. Someone is home. Me. How can I help you? Yes, ma'am. First, me apologize for the rudeness of my introduction. My name is James McCallister, and me and my companions have been on the road for several days now. We're plum tired and we're more than a little lost. "Companions?" Uh, yes, ma'am. That's Boots there, out by the road. He didn't want to ride up to the house and frighten folks. He's being polite. And behind you, well, that's Big Mike. Thousand pardons, Miss. I was just around back checking to see if there's anybody in your garden. Was there? Nope. You gentlemen should have just knocked. Well, we did knock, ma'am. Hm, that's true. Saw Big Mike step up to that door and give it a rap. Most definitely witnessed that with mine own. Must not have knocked too loud. I certainly didn't hear it in the house. Nevertheless... Well, if you gentlemen will just allow me a moment to put the laundry down, I will happily point you in the direction of town. It's about a half hour's walk up the road. And they've got hotels and saloons, and a hot bath house with a brand-new shower. Well, that would be an act of kindness, ma'am. We'd be much obliged. My husband will be along any minute, so he might even be able to show you the way himself. Your husband? Yes, sir. My husband. He should be along any moment. Would your husband happen to have been that feller we saw walking down the road earlier? Walking with a little girl? Yes, he was walking our daughter to school. Oh, ain't that somethin'? A grown man walking a little girl to school. We certainly live in a new age. - Sure does seem like it. - Sure does. You said town's about a half an hour walk up the road? That's right. Hm. Well... your man sure been gone a long time if he was just walking your daughter to school and back. Sure hope nothin' happened to hold him up. Go help him. You all right? The bitch kicked me in the balls. You got your ass whooped by an unarmed woman doing her laundry. - Yeah. - You sure you have balls? Open up, Missy. I'm coming in one way or another. Might as well not piss us off in the meantime. Madam... I think you got the wrong idea about me and the fellas. Ain't no sense runnin' off and hidin'. We don't want to hurt nobody. We need to quit peckerin' around and get back on the trail. That marshal can't be too far behind. A day, day and a half at most. We need to keep moving unless you fools want to end up back in jail. Eustice, shut your damn mouth. Now I know you're scared and you're hiding. If you'll just poke your head out, you'll see we don't got any guns. We just want to talk. Go on. Go get her. Bring her back. - You gon' live? - Yeah. Bring her over! Quickly now! Her arm's all busted up. That's fine. That's fine. I feel like we got off to a bad start. And I'm going to put that on you. Now, when we first met, I introduced myself, did I not? I said my name, loud and clear. You did not do me the same honor. Did ya'? I said, did ya'? You'll get no honor from me. Tell me this then, huh? Is this your husband? Hm? Is he the man we saw walking down the street this morning? Is your husband the Colton Briggs? Heard of my husband, have you? Oh, I've certainly heard of your husband. We're like family, me and him. Good. That saves me the trouble of explaining it to you. You boys are in a world... of hurt. Who the shit is Colton Briggs? Are you serious? Colton Briggs? This is Colton Briggs' place? Eustice, quiet. That's right. And I'm his wife. And you hit me... in the face with your gun. Broke my arm. Shot his horse. You boys have woke up the devil. God damn it, Jimmy. You bringing hell down on us! I absolutely know your husband, hm. We go way back. In fact, I owe him a debt. That'll do. It's time to head home. Mama didn't come to get me from school. You weren't at school. You were here. Yes, but wouldn't she come here to find me if I wasn't at school? Hey, Marshal! You better come on out here. Who are those men? What do we got here? The family? Maybe it looks like the father and the daughter from that picture on the mantle in there. They must've been away when those fellas came through. Thank God they're okay. A little bit of luck, finally. Lucky, indeed. Tell the others to come outside. We shouldn't be making ourselves comfortable in these folks' home. Hey, you guys... family's here. - They're still alive? - Yup. Oh, shit. This you folks home? I want to apologize for my men. We, uh, we didn't realize that no one was home and... My wife was home. Yes, sir. l... uh... I apologize again. My name is US Marshall Franklin Jarrett. I know who you are. Where's Ruth? I'm afraid you have me at a loss, sir. Do I know you? Briggs? Well holy shit, man. I, uh... I apologize, little lady. That language is, uh, not appropriate. You have a family? Well, that is a good thing. A man needs a family. It, uh, grounds him. Evens him out. That is... this is good. Marshal... I'm sorry, Briggs, but... we need to talk. Somewhere private, preferably. Why don't you boys go help him dig that hole? Says he don't want our help. Says we should've been better at our jobs. He ain't wrong. - Go get them horses ready. - Hmm. Little lady... I had Smiley heat up some of that condensed milk and put a little brown sugar in it. It's good. Make you feel better. I never knew your mama. But I know she was a good woman. But I did know your daddy. Years and years ago. You meet a lot of people in this business, and the faces, a lot of times, just disappear over the years. But not your daddy. No, sir. Not him. Your daddy was about the meanest son of a bitch I ever met. Pardon my language, but... I never met anybody like him. Just the way he would look at you, just... like he was looking through you. Like you were nothing. And I don't say this lightly, but y... your daddy was a violent man. I've seen him shoot three cowboys one time. Now it was a fair fight, but... I don't think his blood raised an ounce. I can't say he was a criminal. I don't know that, but I can say that he... was not what I would call a "good man." Not back then. Why are you telling me this? Hm. I guess I just want you to understand... how good a woman your mama was. She took the coldest killer that I've ever met, and she turned him into a family man. Minding a store. Raising a little lady. That was a good thing your mama done. My father used to kill people? Yeah. But that was years ago. I haven't even seen my father hold a gun. And that's because he's a good man now. Because of what your mama done. You carry a gun. Are you a good man? I try to be. My mama's dead now. Is my father still a good man? Would you like for me to say a few words? You said plenty of words. None of them helped. There's something you should know. Um, them fellas left a mess in your barn. Not something your little girl should see. You'll wanna clean that up before you let her go in there. I reckon we'll be hitting the trail. I figured we're only a few hours behind 'em. And I think I've got a pretty good idea where they're going. Tell me the names of the men who did this. Tell me where they're going. No, sir. I don't think I can do that. I reckon it's been a few years since the world has seen the old Colton Briggs and I think the world is probably pretty happy leaving that just right where it is. Tell me the names of the men responsible for the death of my wife. Briggs, listen to yourself. You see that little girl over there? She just lost her mama. She needs her father now. Whatever changes happened to you that that woman gave you, don't let 'em die with her. That little girl needs the man that she knows and loves. You know, ever since we were granted statehood, this here land is now part of a new country. We got laws. We got due process. Folks just don't go around killin' other folks. That ain't the world anymore. Keep right by your daughter. Keep right by God. I will find those murderous sons of bitches. I will catch 'em. We will take them to trial, and they will hang. I promise that to you. Take care of your daughter. As long as that little girl is alive, there's no room for vengeance in your life. What do we do now? Go to bed. I need you. "As long as she's alive." Mama wouldn't like you pointing that gun at me. Get dressed. Those are pants. No dresses. We leave in 15 minutes. This is Mama's horse. Yeah. They killed mine. We'll have to travel light. She can't run with both of us. If we're gonna catch up with those men, we're gonna need another horse. Yeah. We'll find one along the way. This is a good time for us to do this. My teacher at school is sick. If it's pox, she could be sick for days. She could die. They'll get a new teacher. I forgot my school books. - I think they burned up in the fire. - We'll get new books. - What about my clothes? - We'll get new clothes. Why did we burn the old ones? Because we're not going back! We're not going back. As soon as I finish what I have to do, we'll find a new place and... we'll replace everything you lost. Except Mama. Give me the belt. You gonna whoop me? Take that. Over there by that tree, off the path. You can sleep for 30 minutes, not longer. Then we'll eat, and we'll get back on trail. We'll do that every four hours until we catch 'em. Aren't those men getting further away? They're only men. They need sleep as well. They'll wait for us. But if we keep going, we can be there sooner, - before anything... - Won't do us no good if we get there dead tired. Or if our horse dies from exhaustion. It's not enough that we find these men. We need to be ready to kill 'em. Because they'll be meaning to kill us. Did that seem strange to you? That little girl last night? How do you mean? Her mama had just been killed. She was sittin' there right next to the body. Not a tear on her face. Hell, I never even met the woman. I cried more about it than her own daughter. Well, she's probably just shocked from the news. I mean, her mama was just killed. She ain't never coming back. Gotta be hard for any youngster to understand. I suppose so. Holy shit! Come on. Come on. Come on. Holy shit, son. How'd you do that? My leg is busted. That one's a shooter, shit. It's that marshal. You didn't shoot the marshal? God damn it! That asshole started the ambush before we're in position! What do we do? Do you see Briggs? Shit, boss, I don't know what he looks like. Oh, you'll know when you see him. I promise you that. Get down, Smiley! Oh! Dumbass. Let's see how far them bastards get now. Boss is pulling out. Next reload, let's get up that hill. I'm out of here! God help us. Is it time to leave? I heard gunshots coming from across the canyon. - When? - Ten minutes ago. Why didn't you wake me? No reason to hurry. Gunshots might have a way of speeding some folks up, but... they have a nasty habit of slowing other folks down. We'll find out what happened soon enough. Either way. I can't believe you. You want to tell me what the hell just happened? Huh? What the hell, boss? Those guys up front, they were about to go behind the hill. I wouldn't have seen 'em if I waited. You were supposed to shoot the Marshal first. Huh? Instead, genius here decides to shoot the first guy he sees, chasing everybody, including the marshal, into cover. You know... I go to enormous pains to invite Colton Briggs to come find me. You go ahead and leave a perfectly healthy lawman between us. It's like you're trying to work against me. Is that what's happening here? Huh? You're working against me? Nah, boss. I'm with you. I just messed up. That's all. I certainly hope so. Because if that lawman stops Briggs before he can get to me... there will be hell to pay. Mm. It don't matter for nothing. You got somethin' to say, old man? If Colton Briggs decides he's coming, you might as well set an extra plate at the table because Colton Briggs is coming. What's going on? There's a rider coming. One of the men who killed Mama? Maybe one of the men from the posse? Either way, we need his horse. - Are you gonna kill him? - I'm gonna take his horse. Chances are, he won't like me doing that. I don't think Mama would like you killin' no lawman. I don't know if he is a lawman. Chances are he won't stop and give me time to ask. Can't you think of another way to stop him? He'll be coming from that direction. You stand there and get him to stop. How? Cry. Make him feel sorry for you. I don't know how. What did you just say? I don't know how to cry. Now, you listen to me. People in this world expect you to act like they do. They expect you to laugh at their jokes, and sigh at their babies, and cry at their funerals. And if you can't learn to do those things, they won't accept you. They'll push you out. Now, do you wanna make it in this world? Answer me! Do you wanna fit in? Then you're going to have figure out how to act like them. You remember last summer when the parson's daughter died? You remember how his wife cried? Wahh wahh! Wahh wahh! A little louder. Wahh wahh! My baby! My baby! Wahh wahh! My baby! My baby! That'll have to do. Keep it up. Wahh wahh! Wahh wahh! Wahh wahh! You okay, little girl? Wahh! My baby! My baby! Wahh! Baby? What baby? What? What are you getting at? Wahh! You're gettin' off that horse. You should have gone with Mark. He looked pretty bad. And what? Leave you two here without protection? I ain't helpless. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. It's me. Shit, Mark. You scared the hell out of us. What the hell are you doing back here? Where's your horse? Ask them. What the hell?! I'm sorry, guys. Now, Briggs, I know you're upset. Hell, I don't blame you. But whatever you think you're doing, you need to let these boys go. Fetch that Rossi and bring it here. My father wants your shotgun. Do what she says, Greg. I will blow this little girl's brains all over this valley. Do you hear me? I said I will blow her brains all over this valley. I'll pull the trigger right now! He cries pretty good. I'm gonna try and do it like him next time. Both of you put your hands behind your back. Is this enough wood? That wood's too green. It needs to burn hotter. See the tip of that? Should burn so hot it glows red. Fetch dry wood. It burns hotter. It burns faster. Listen to me, Briggs. Just listen to me. Up till now, you haven't committed any crimes that you can't walk away from. I understand that you're under a lot of pressure, pain of losing your wife. I can't imagine it. Any man might have done the same thing. Made some of the same decisions that you've made. But you are about to cross a line that you can't get back from. Assaulting a US Marshal, murdering a US Marshal, that is trouble that you have not encountered before. Are you sure about that? What about your daughter, Briggs? You're making her an accessory. These men here need medical attention and you are preventing them from getting it. No. You are. By not telling me what I want to know. I'm a federal marshal. You're asking me to participate in murder. You're protecting a killer. From another killer. Correct. Is this dry enough? Good. Put it on the fire. We'll be ready to start soon. If anything happens to my men, I swear to God, I will hunt you down and I will kill you myself. Like you hunted down the man who killed my wife? The man who killed your men? The man responsible for everything happening right now? I'll take my chances. Rip his shirt. Don't you touch me! Give him the stick like I showed you. - Please... stop... - James McCallister! Name's James McCallister. He rides with three men, Michael Orleans and Boots Miller and Eustice Bedford. They're all hardened criminals. Word is, he promised them a share of a lockbox he's got stashed somewhere if they'd bust him out of the prison in Powell County. And they're headed to Colorado. Somebody told me he's got a little Mexican girl down there in a town he likes called Santa Rosa. The trail I was on meant that he was headed that way. And that's all I know about it. I swear it. Hold him. - No, no. - Oh, you son of a bitch! I will kill you, you son of a bitch! Bring me the iron. Pinch the flesh on each side of the wound and push it together. We have to burn it with the iron or he'll bleed out soon. Smells like Mama's rabbit chops. Mm, that's the whiskey. Makes me hungry. Mm-hmm. The bullet was poisoning him. He's got a chance now. But these men are not walking out of this canyon. If get to Santa Rosa... and there's no James McCallister, no Mexican girl, no gang of four, I will come back here and I will kill these two men before you can return with help. And then, I will wait for you. And no matter how many men you bring back with you, I will kill you first. I will kill you... before you even see me. Do you understand? We're taking your guns and your horse. You gotta leave me a horse, Briggs! - You can't take my horse! - Take your mother's horse. - This one suits me fine. - Damn it, don't question me. You've got more experience with your mother's horse. She knows you. Fewer surprises. Now get up. I'll leave your horse tied up in Santa Rosa. I'm no horse thief. Justice is gonna find you, Briggs. - H'yah! - You hear me? God damn you. Justice will catch you! There. Just like I told you boys. Let's crack her open and see what we got. Oh, lordy. Whoo-hoo! "El Banco Londres Y Mexico"? What the hell? Now settle down. What the hell, boss? Where's the money, boss? Now, if I was crossing you, I would have killed you already. But I didn't. Nothing but a dirty rat... You ain't too bright now, is you? But that's okay. That's why you got me. I got brains. And my brains know that since we busted out of jail, we're gonna have to lay low for a while. At least a year or so. Any of you boys got any idea what kind of money they spend down in Mexico? Hm? Right there, that's enough dinero for each of us to live like kings for as long as we need. Each of you get an equal share, hm, as long as you stick with me. Or, we can split it up here and part ways as friends. But I will tell you this. That money... well, ain't worth a nickel this side of the border. Not unless you know where to spend it. And boys... I do. What about this Briggs fella? Yeah, we're gonna have to figure that out and figure it out fast. It's all part of the plan. Should we wait for him and set a ambush like we did for the marshal? We don't know how far behind us Briggs might be. We could be sittin' in the bush for days. And two, Briggs ain't the type of man to walk into an ambush unprepared. Then how do we hunt him down? I thought I made myself clear. We ain't huntin' nobody. Briggs is huntin' us. What do we need that for? It's good firewood. That was on someone's grave. So? It belongs to someone. Nothing belongs to the dead... because the dead don't need anything. Only the living need to possess things. The living need food, water, shelter, clothes, family, money, and land. But the dead, the dead've already been tended to. Once they're put in the ground, they have all they need. They're not selfish. I like the dead. I don't like this. There's a sheriff. Well, the sheriff's in Denver. Two days away. We cut the telegraph lines coming into town, which means it'll be upwards of four days before any sheriff can get the news that we're here and show up to do anything about it. That office is where they keep the bad folks until the lawman can come pick 'em up. Still... feelin' mighty exposed ridin' into town like this. You gonna question my every call? Now, I need you boys to set a guard at the edge of town, all right? Anyone rides in, you let me know. And rotate every couple hours. Y'all look like dog shit. I need you rested for when Briggs gets here or you're of no use to me. Understand? And ladies, I assume you're well rested. I am in need of your services. You heard him. Who wants first watch? Well, I'll take first watch. But you better come and relieve me in four hours. You want to give me a hand with this? That marshal said you used to kill people. That marshal should guard his words when speaking to children. Is it true? Yes. He said you gave it up. He said you gave it up for Mama. Is that true? He said Mama changed you. My entire life... even as a boy, I knew. I knew I was different. My mother always said I didn't cry as a baby. I didn't laugh. When my mother died, I was very young, but I didn't shed a tear at her funeral. Lots of folks did, but I didn't. Growing up, the other kids would play games and joke with each other, and they would cry... if they got hurt or if they were scared. And I'd watch 'em. I got pretty good at pretending. Good enough, anyway. Pretending I was like the other kids. Pretending I was... normal. That's when I realized I had never known fear. My whole life, I'd seen fear in the eyes of every man I ever met. I've come to expect it. Grown men, terrified when they had no reason to be. I remember this one man who was looking for me because I had shot a couple of his friends. He caught up with me in a bathhouse. My pistol's lying out of reach, next to my clothes. And I remember seeing this man holding a gun on a cold, naked man sitting in a tub, and yet, he was the one shaking. Too scared to move. So, I stood up from my bath, and I quietly walked over to the man and I took his pistol away. And then I shot him dead with it. He didn't even beg for his life. And even though I could recognize fear in men, even to a point where I could use it against them, I can honestly say I had no idea what it actually felt like. It was as if... I'd been born... dead inside. But I didn't care. 'Cause I was dead inside. How did Mama change that? When I met your mother, there was no introduction. There was no getting to know each other. And in that first moment, I saw her. I felt something. Something I'd never felt before. Love? Fear. Fear she wouldn't talk to me. Fear she wouldn't love me. Fear I couldn't make her my wife. Fear of losing her. She was the only thing I ever feared... and the only thing I ever loved. When they told me Mama was dead, I didn't know how to feel. She was your mother. You feel sad. You feel loss. Is that how you felt? I felt pain. Like a part of me was killed with her. Do you still feel like that? When Mama died, I didn't feel anything. It was as if I died. Like I was lost. I was lying in my bed, in my room... in our house. But it felt like I would never find my way back to those things again. You will. Do you know the man who killed Mama? The man the marshal told us about? James McCallister? Tomorrow, after the sun comes up... can you teach me how to shoot? Good. I think I'd like that. Oh! Son of a bitch. Oh. Oh, damn it. Now remember, keep your left eye closed. Let the barrel drift right above your target. When you're ready, gently breathe all the air out of your lungs and let the barrel fall. Time it so your breath ends just as you line up your shot. At the bottom of your breath, squeeze the trigger, don't pull, Squeeze with your whole hand. Were you aiming for the hat? Just below it. I was aiming for his chest. You pulled. You didn't squeeze. Let's try it again. What's wrong? Can I try the pistol? H'yah! Hit! Remember to squeeze. Don't pull. Morning, Eustice. Those turkey bungholes never relieved me of duty last night. Left me sittin' out there all night! Is that so? Boys? Come on down. What is it, boss? Eustice here has a grievance he would like to air with the rest of the gang. - Go ahead. - You two! You were supposed to relieve me in my post after four hours. And that didn't happen. And that's bullshit! Eustice, please accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of the rest of the gang. We sure are sorry, ain't we, boys? And why didn't you just come get us? What? If we were supposed to relieve you, why didn't you just come get one of us to take your place? Eustice? Why didn't you just come get one of the boys? Well, I... I didn't want to leave my post, you know? Briggs is a dangerous man. And if he would've seen there was no guard, he might have snuck in here and got us. You didn't... fall asleep, did you? No, boss. Eustice... you wouldn't be lying to me, would you? No, boss. I mean, I... I might've... I might've shut my eyes for a second or two as I... You know, was so tired. It was... it was a long ride and I... I... Eustice, shh. Oh. Falling asleep on guard duty is a terrible thing to do. What if Briggs had shown up and you'd been asleep? Yeah. Yeah, he might have snuck in and got us, like you said. No. I would have seen him. Now, I did you a favor. All right? Next time you're on watch, you get a little sleepy, you just give that broken finger a squeeze, and you'll perk right back up. What's wrong? There's only one way into town. If they're down there, they'll be watching everyone who comes in. They left a message in the barn. It felt familiar. Like it was meant for me. What'd it say? I don't like walking in, not knowing who I'm looking for. If they know me, it'll give them the edge. They'll see me coming. I won't see them. Do you think they'll know me? Now you ride into town casually. You've been sent on an errand from your parents' farm up the road. Keep your head up, and look at everyone carefully. Head straight for the mercantile. Go inside and ask the man to buy something. And then casually ask if any riders had come through town. Whatever he tells you, you bring that information straight back to me. Can I help you, young lady? Young lady? Pardon my manners. You must have caught me daydreaming. I almost forgot why I came in here. My mama got it in her head yesterday that she had to bake a cake for the church potluck this weekend. Last year, she made a pie, but the apples that she used grew on Mr. Johnson's apple tree, the one back by his outhouse. And wouldn't you know it, those apples tasted plum like shit and made anyone who ate them sick to their gut. I tell ya', I think that shit in that outhouse soaked down into the roots and changed the way a basic apple can taste. But Mr. Johnson says that's a bunch of hooey, and because of that, he won't let Mama have any more apples for her apple pie, which, as far as I'm concerned, is fine by me and Mama because like I mentioned before, those apples taste like shit anyhow. Who the hell is Mr. Johnson? Is this the little girl you seen, Boots? It is the little girl we saw the other morning. Hello there, little miss. That's a fine horse you're riding. Couldn't help but notice the saddle. Wouldn't mind telling me how you got it, would you? Better yet... Why don't you just tell me where your daddy is? Maria, this here is my little sister. Buenos dias. Still no sign of him. Hm. He'll be around soon enough, I 'spect. This one hasn't touched her food. I 'spect she's too scared to eat. Is that it, little sister? You too scared to eat? No. Of course not. 'Spect the daughter of Colton Briggs ain't scared of nothin'. You boys hang that sign outside like I asked? Red paint. Just like you asked. Good. Where's Big Mike? He's got a good angle at the road into town. Ah, well. One of you set up at the other end of town. - The other across the street. - Yes, sir. Oh, and, boys... Stay out of sight, all right? It's important he gets to the middle of town and sees our invitation before we throw him his little surprise party. Boss, if we get a chance to put a bullet in Colton Briggs, we oughta do it. It ain't smart playing games with a fella like that. Sounds like he's the one who's scared. Sure does, doesn't it? You hear what little sister just said? You scared? I'll take the other end of town. Boss is expecting Briggs anytime. Might wanna wake your ass up. - I'm awake. - Good. Keep it that way. We're supposed to let him get into town before we kill him. He wants him to see that we got his daughter or something. Makes sense. You do yourself and all of us a favor. You see that son of a bitch, you put a bullet in him. H'yah! Go back right there. If you ain't too scared to eat, why ain't you touched your food yet? It's probably poison. So you is scared. Scared of poison. You don't have to be scared to not eat poison. Just not stupid. You see this? No poison. I couldn't poison you even if I wanted to. Reckon it's some kind of sin to poison your kin. Stop saying that. Stop sayin' what? Stop calling me your sister. We ain't kin. You and I are most certainly kin in almost all respects. The uh... fruits of your father's labors. Sure as shootin'. - You're a liar. - I'm not saying that your daddy knocked my mama up and they made a baby. No, no, no. There was another man who had the honors of my physical birth. But he's not around no more... on account of the day I like to call my... "spiritual birth." You see, it was on that day that your daddy... he decided I didn't need mine anymore. He took him away from me. Right there in front of me. I watched him die. Watched the life leave his eyes. It was right then that I stared into the eyes of the man who killed him. And you know what your daddy did? He stared right back at me. Then he... he got on his horse and he rode away. But not all of him. No. See, he... he left a tiny little piece of himself buried deep inside of me. Like a seed. Workin' on a little insurance policy. We don't need those boys gettin' any ideas about running off with the money. It used to be you couldn't find nothing around these parts except tequila. Finding whiskey in Santa Rosa? It's progress. You see, the problem with progress is that something's gonna go. In with the new, out with the old. That's the way of the world. But this transition... Oh, it's rarely a peaceful one. No, ma'am. Transition of power is one of violence. Necessary violence. Which is why we're here today. You see... I got a monster inside of me. The devil himself. That devil can't get out as long as there's another devil out there in the world. Both these devils... can't exist at the same time. Oh, I get it. You're crazy. But don't worry, my father will be here soon. He'll fix that. Hmm, you know, I'm glad we had this time together. Get to know each other as siblings. 'Cause after tonight, after your father gets here... well, I'm gonna be your new daddy. And we'll see what needs fixin'. Eustice! Oh, he's here. Eustice! He's here! Help! He's here. Don't, mister, please, don't kill... Holy shit. He's here! He done killed Big Mike, and got one of them Mexican cowboys! The devil does not disappoint. Let's go see Pa. Walk. He went down that alley, behind these buildings. Go around and flush him out. Christ Almighty. Eustice, did you hear what said? Go! I got you, pendejo. You see him? He must've circled back. I got him! He got Boots, but I shot him! - Is he dead? - No. I only winged him. But he's got a bullet in him, sure as shit. He's holed up in that building over there by the alley. You're sure about that? He seem like the type of fella to just hole up and wait for us to come get him? Guess we'll see. You two. You see that mercantile? Now, the villain that killed your buddy is inside. Why don't you go in there and get him? I'll double your pay if you bring him out alive. Be careful now. He's a snake. He may be a snake but he ain't - a Goddamn wizard. - Eustice... I need you to just trust me. Can you do that? Shame to have to let you go so close to the end. Briggs! I'm calling you out. Ain't that what you boys used to do? Call each other out? Settle your differences in the street? Let's do this the old way! Holster that pistol, Mister. I swear to God, I'll kill this little girl. Hello, handsome. Remember me? No. Get your hands up. Both of 'em. It's busted. You got him, boss. What are we gonna do? You really don't remember me. I gotta say, hurts my feelings. But I guess it's not too surprising. I was just a little whooper last time you saw me. The important thing is... I remember you. Don't worry. I'm okay. I definitely remember you, Colton Briggs. Every time I close my eyes, I see your face... staring me down. I smell the smoke from your guns, hear the noises my daddy made as he died. And that's why we're here. You, me... your little girl. She never would tell me her name, but it don't matter none. We're just one big happy family. You see... we're gonna have a showdown, you and me. And you get the opportunity to put a bullet in my head just like you did my daddy. And if you do that, Eustice here, he's gonna blow your little girl's head off. - Boss, just kill him! - Shut up! Now... you kill me... and watch your little girl die. Or save your daughter, and watch me take your place. Brooke. I have all I need. See that I'm tended to. No. And... I love you. No! Holy shit. I did it! I killed him! I'm so sorry, Daddy. I love you so much. I did it! I'm so sorry. I killed Colton Briggs! I killed him! You hear that, Daddy? I killed him. It's... It's you. You're the monster... You're no kin. Brooke... take your mother. She'll tell you what to do. You alive? Found another body in the back alley back there. That makes four of 'em. More or less what I expected. Round up the bodies and let's get 'em back. Will they bring him home? Yeah, I suppose they will. Thank you. Marshal? What are you going to tell them? I thought I might bring you in for what you and your daddy did. Tell them how you captured us and tortured us and... left us to die out in the desert. But I suppose the judge would just say that you were... following your daddy's orders and... blind with rage over your mama's murder... even though you and I both know that ain't quite true. And in that case, your daddy would be buried as a criminal. And you would go home to try to figure out what to do with your daddy's store. Found a strongbox in the saloon, Marshal. Good work, Corporal. That'll be all. And then I considered telling them that you and your daddy... came along, and you saved my deputy's life... by performing field surgery on his shoulder. Then you proceeded to track down your mother's murderers and then he was killed in the process of their apprehension in which case you would still go home. So, I figure since the outcomes in both those scenarios are the same, I prefer the story that doesn't involve me getting captured by a 12-year-old girl. And maybe in that version, we can forget all about that strong box, too. In that version... my daddy gets to be a hero? In exchange for your discretion. Yes. I believe that sounds about right. Well then, it's decided. Marshal? Did you find your horse? Tied up at the edge of town. Just like he said. You get on home, little Briggs. Take care of your daddy's store. H'yah. You hear that, Daddy? You're gonna be a hero. Mama would be so proud. Maria, isn't it? Si, Senorita. Why don't you fetch me my brother's saddlebag from inside the saloon? I best be getting on home.
