Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. PORT OF ROSARIO CITY. All through the film the old guy keeps repeating: "Rosebul, Rosebul". It's an old movie. The thing is: The multi million guy owns mansions. He owns a radio, a newspaper. Impressive. And some guys need to know why the fuck the old guy kept saying "Rosebul". In short, you never know what the fuck "Rosebul" is, and in the end when the old man croaks, they burn everything, even an old sleigh that he had when he was a kid. - And then? - Nothing, that's the end. That's the end? A bad movie. No, it's a good movie, black and white, but it's good. Excuse me... We need a respirator in here. Relax. I was just kidding. Enjoy your cigarette. Have you met the new manager? - He's a Spanish guy. - He's from Buenos Aires, but he lived in Spain the last few years. He banned smoking anywhere in the office. And he ordered smoke detectors. - Here? - Yeah. I've seen the young guy. Silva is his last name. Young, maybe too young. Anyhow he looks like a nice guy. But... who knows? What does he do? Castilla? Basically, he's a ball breaker. Don't be so tough, he's okay. Can you believe he never finds 5 minutes to have a cup of tea here with us? He's upset with the upgrading. When they brought the new computers, you can't imagine what a mess he made! "Torriglia, this is the end!" He said. He's a fucking stupid old man. Never a bad word, never a curse. Some gentleman. It's just an act for the girls. You know it's true. "Bedspread" he said to Ines. What he was talking about? What the fuck: About a blanket! Why didn't he say blanket, like everybody? In all the years I know him, he never got tangled up with any girl, not even for a coffee. All he does is talk, he's a jerk! - Gossiping about Castilla again? - She already knows. You don't like him because he's a gentleman. You like to be flattered. No stupid, I like to be well treated, like any woman. When you set your "onanism?" aside you'll understand. Excuse me. What a nice blouse Ines! Thanks, Adalberto, do you like it? Were you talking about something? About films, discussing movies... I don't go to the movies. Before I used to watch three movies in a row. Matinee, vermouth and... Those were times where you could see Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum... Gregory Peck. - And today's actors, what about them? - Where are the other coffee cups, guys? Monserrat took them upstairs. Wash one up. You can use mine, Ines. - It's okay, Adalberto. - I have to work. Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck. - Would you like a little sandwich, Roli? - No. - Aren't you going to practice? - No, my ankle hurts. - Do you have any stories to tell me? - What about? - From Rugby practice. - Mother! Okay. - Mother! - Okay! Adalberto, why don't you ask for a loan the Company offers to their employees? - You know they won't deny it to you! - Not for the world, Sari. Rolito has to go on that trip to Australia with the Rugby team. It's important for him. Why this trip, when you never wanted him to go camping! This one it's so expensive, Sari! But you said that they don't charge interest. No, but the house will be collateral. I can't put my home at risk. I can sleep at night. I sleep like a baby. Like a baby. They owe you so much! Never a raise, never a promotion. It's not as easy as it looks. I won't step on anybody's head to be promoted. Promoted, promoted where to? Don't be unfair, Sari. They should retire me, not promote me. - But look at Torriglia! - Torriglia, Torriglia. Torriglia started years later and he earns more. I know very well how Torriglia was promoted, and I doubt he sleeps the way I do. Right! The only people who get ahead are tramps and thieves. You are the only honest one. Sarita, there are many ways to get promoted, many... Get down here, Casimiro! Try? Was it a try? Why don't you go to the kitchen to talk? Okay, we're leaving. Listen, don't you have a new manager? Does he know how long you've been there? - Yes, Sari. - Why don't you talk to him? He's a snotty, arrogant, haughty kid... I don't understand how these kids today get to such high positions. Maybe he is capable, Adalberto... Capable of anything. Nobody ever stops him. Imported car, cell phone... What's wrong with that? I have a cell phone, too. That guy made it, and he'll provide a good life for his family. Maybe I'm mistaken. Maybe it's me. Good morning, young lady, Silva is waiting for me, I have the report. Mr. Silva, here is... What did you say your name was? - Castilla, Adalberto. - Castill"o". He's bringing a report. - Let him in, Julia. - It's that door. My last name is Castilla, Castilla. I know the door. - Mr. Castilla! - Ah, okay. - How are you? - This looks good. Very nice... - Just a second, please. - Sure. If the princess phones, I'll take it. Do you want me to call and see if she picks up? No, it's okay. I'm sorry, Castilla. Come on in. Very well. Could you prepare some of these with last year's charges by tomorrow? I'd like to show them to the directors. Of course, my pleasure. Any problems, you know, my door is always open. Of course, when I'm here; otherwise I leave it closed. Okay. I don't want to be impertinent, but I saw those old magazines. "Tertulias" Yes, I collect them. That's good! A young guy having such an illustrative hobby. And when I was younger I used to collect Havana cigar labels, coins, stamps... Lately in Barcelona I got excited about these magazines. But, look: - One is missing! - Can you believe that? I think I have seen some of these here in Rosario. What a coincidence! I have a copy of one at home. I can't believe it! Yes, and, did you check at secondhand bookshops? At the second, the first, in waiting rooms, whore saloons. Nothing, nothing. Absolutely nothing. Now, the one you say you have, couldn't it be... - I'll check on that. - Please, do. It's one that I keep with special affection because when Prince Humbert of Saboya came here, Jockey Club gave a special reception to him. And there is a photo where my father is standing by the prince. And you have one copy? Only one. My relatives in Spain sent it to us. Why don't you check? 48. That's the number I'm missing. Here is my cell number, call me if anything arises. - Yes, sir, I'd be glad to. - Good. - Excuse me. - Go ahead. Good bye. Sit Fernadez Asenjo at the head, he needs to feel important. Are you always going to make such a big deal for a meeting? Those dinosaurs are still scared. They look for excuses to criticize me. To get me out of the way. They told the French partners that maybe I was too young. Imagine those frenchs, they don't care at all. You sit D'Arthuys over here. He's the most aggressive one. And Doval, Doval... Over here. Those two are plotting. Plus, this one. We are going to make him feel uneasy. Take the rest of the chairs out. - Would you let me smoke a cigarette? - No, Julia. I stopped smoking three years ago, and trust me, it's much better. Yesterday I forgot a lighter at your place, didn't I? It would be good if someone served some coffee. But it has to be a man. They like to make some macho comments. That's reassuring. What's the name of the guy with bulging eyes? - Mesina? - That one, Mesina. Sit him here. His eyes bother me. Those eyes! Don't transfer any calls to this phone. At 3:05 Call me on my cell. Just call and leave it on your desk. That's all. Yeah, and "Lomu" from All Blacks was an idol. He would do 100 meters in He's a beast, his weight is 264 pounds. What a great contribution to humanity, culture... Get online, I'll send you a video through Messenger. Are you done yet? See this? Look, Adalberto. And who is that? Jauregui, my classmate from high school. - Is this the celebrated Jauregui? - Yes. My father, Sari. Your grandfather, Roli. This picture must be previous to appointing him... Vice-President of the Ethics Club Committee. But... wasn't he on the other side of the picture? Wasn't he this one? Oh yes. This one. You made me look all over just for this? You have an album full of your father's photos. But here he is with the prince Humbert of Saboya, Sari. The family was always connected to the monarchy. Don't forget our great grand father was Marquis of the Octavillas. How could I forget! You are also related to this, Sari. You too, Roli. "Fierce lion over bronze field. " It's the family's shield. How nice, a lion. Are there lions in Spain? And this way the Company can keep on growing normally. Also more loads per container and the dispatch in bulk, right? I've promised fast changes. I'm showing them. Yes, but forgive me... Excuse me, please. Hello? How do you do, Mr. Ayllon? Right now, in a meeting with the board of directors. Have you heard the good news? OK I'll wait for your call. Well, goodbye, sir. Give my regards to your wife. I'm very sorry. Where were we? Get me the yellow cord. Which one did you get? No, no that's the green one. Good afternoon, young lady, don't get up. I just brought this for Mr. Silva. He's in a meeting with the directors. No, you know what? - No, be careful. - Don't touch the red one. It doesn't matter. Mr. Castilla, - I'm sorry, you are Castilla! - Yes. He told me that when you came, just go in. Do you know where the meeting room is? I've been in the Company for a long time. That happens when you ask Raul something, he is a bit... He is color blind. That's what he is. After the reorganization we did with the Psychological Consultancy, our people changed to a much more constructive attitude. Relationships improved within the Company, and so gained a much more familiar environment. And foreseeing the success of this meeting, I went ahead and prepared a toast. Ariel, please. Yes. I am busy at the moment. It was only one, Julia. Ah yes, I'll take it. Excuse me, please. Hi, my Princess! The dress that I gave you? You undressed and you are naked? Really? What did you stain it with? Nesquik? Did you tell mom? Let's do something, because daddy is busy now. I'll call you later... and you tell me all about it. Many kisses on your belly. Castilla, come in. - Excellent, Castilla. - Thank you Sir. Very good, okay, leave it here. Excuse me. Castilla, did you find out about the magazine? It's a coincidence, in fact I have it at home the number of the magazine that you are looking for: 48. Exactly the number where my father appears. Amazing, I can't believe it! You are providential, Mr. Castilla. These collectables that you can never complete... But, this one was possible. Obviously it was possible. I'm going to tell you, briefly, something incredible: I started collecting a very old Spanish magazine since I got to Barcelona. I had a missing number. I looked all over the world, and now Castilla tells me that he has it, here, in Rosario. It's incredible! Really, isn't it? Marvelous, Castilla, great. Thank you so much. I don't want you just give it to me. Everything has a price. So, tell me later how much you want for the magazine. Go now, Castilla. Thank you. Well, you'll have to excuse me, Mr. Silva. But this magazine has a special emotional value. My father appears in it. I can't give it to you, or even worse, sell it. Maybe, being young you can't realize about this. But not everything has a price, Mr. Silva. There are things that money can't buy. Excuse me. There he is. Happy Anniversary Say a few words, Adalberto. No, not me, what would I say? No! Come on, Sari, don't be shy. Stop that, Roli, please. Let's see. We've already been married for many years. On that we agree. And I still remember when we first met, so elegant, he seemed such a gentleman to me. Do you remember, Mom? You and grandmother used to say that Adalberto looked like a handsome movie star. She doesn't remember... And Magda, you were green with envy. Me?! Don't say stupid things, I had my own affairs. He always brought me flowers when he came to see me. You always brought me flowers and took me to the cinema, do you remember? Don't tell intimacies, Sarita. And... We have a beautiful son, and a beautiful daughter, and if God allows it she'll be here next year... And we've spent wonderful moments together, and we'll spend many more. How stupid I am, I'm so moved! The owl, Adalberto, you haven't forgotten the owl of this year, have you? See, let's see. How beautiful it is! Look at it. Beautiful! So many little owls! I will tell you an anecdote that reveals very clearly the difference in education we were talking about. This morning the new manager called me over. Ayoung guy. He called you over? You didn't tell me. Well, I was keeping it for now. Listen, Ernesto, Reiner, listen to this, it's very good. The new manager called me... What did you tell him? "There are things that money can't buy". I told him that, and left. Winner! You were good. "There are things you can't buy with money", what a winner! Well, it's okay, Torriglia. Anyone with some ethics and dignity would have done the same. Everybody was looking at me. There was a silence, and then I told him: "Excuse me Mr. Silva, but for me this magazine has an emotional value, and there are things that money can't buy". Did you say that? And I left. What a life lesson! Someone has to stop him. The arrogance! The arrogance of today's kids. Irresponsible, that's what you are, an irresponsible. On the contrary, Sari... Who do you think you are? Tell me, where are you going to find a job, when your boss kicks you in the ass? Why you had to be a hero with your boss? I wasn't a hero. Hero is someone who defeats himself. And don't talk smutty. It's not a big deal. The same you've done with your daughter. And see how everything ended! If you get fired, where are we going to get the money from, so Rolito can travel with the rugby team? Answer me! I'm talking about principles. That's what I'm talking about. Julia, call Castilla from administration to come here immediately. Excuse me Mr. Silva. Did you want to see me? Have you thought about the magazine? It's a shame that my father is in the picture next to Prince Humberto. - Otherwise, I would do it. - Lf you didn't want to sell it, why didn't you tell me that it was a different number? I'm not used to telling lies. You don't sell me the magazine and I'll have you fired. You are shrewd, Castilla. So many years working here, your severance pay would be a fortune. At least for you. But you are wrong. I'm not thinking on firing you, but I could have you retired. Are you the kind of men who can live without working? Be at home all day, doing nothing? I'm sorry to think that you could do that. The worst part is that I suspect that you could live doing nothing. How far are you willing to go on this? Mr. Silva, really, I'm not trying to get you upset. I don't want to throw everything away. My great grandfather Alfonso was a Marquis of the Octavillas in Spain. And my father was vice president of... How much do you want for the magazine? Lets do something, I'm not against negotiations, but you picked the worst time and place. Let's suppose you weren't aware of that. I want to finish right now with this. I'll pay $5000 for the magazine. Mr. Silva, I'm not talking about money. My father's memories can't be measured with money. Very well, you are challenging me, and I take it, Castilla. Fatiga! Fatiga. Angel. Angelito! How are you, my friend? Motherfucker, what a surprise. You look the same. And you too. Oh! Come on, you must be kidding. Today I said: "I'll take him a bit farther"... Hey, smells like shit, did you step on shit? No. I have it here. Look, the way we meet! - Lets have some coffee. - I'm in a hurry. Let's go for a cup of coffee. It's been a long time! - I'm with Casimiro. - They aren't racists. Lets go. Come, Casimiro! I always come here. You and I came here a couple of times. - Do you remember? - No, I don't remember. Come on, don't you remember? You picked me up a couple of times. What would you like to drink? Nothimg. I'll stay for a minute. They are waiting for me. And your wife, Elida? No, Elida no, Esther was her name. She died 15 years ago, poor thing. Wasn't it Elida? - And your daughter, fine? - Yes, fine. I also have a boy now, Rolito. - You finally got a boy! - No, he is adopted. My wife, had Susana, and wanted more and... Lots of errands for that. - The dog, does it bother you? - As long as he doesn't poop. No, I have it here. Remember when your wife kicked me out? We haven't seen each other ever since that day. - Never again? - 1985. '85. You took me to your house because my blood pressure was low. She threw me out because she thought I was drunk. - That was the last day? - Yes. Remember our pranks at the military service? And when we let the air out of the tires in Gomez' car? Good times! Do you remember we wanted to buy a boat? Let's do this: Come to my house one day and I'll show you the books I have. A huge encyclopedia about boats. Only boats. So, do you have many books about boats? - Adalberto - Yes? Don't you want to come to the living room? What for, Sari? To watch the news, to drink something. No thanks, dear, I'll pass. I'll pass, I'll pass. Torriglia, when you have a minute would you take this out? What? They're showing admiration for what you did! To the same one? No, the BBQ place, with the guys from Terminal 1. The game is on TV. - Are you coming? - I'll finish this and go. Castilla, I need you to go to the bank. Me, what for? We must deliver these documents urgently. They'll be waiting for you. - I'm a little old to be an errand boy. - We need a signature. Someone of your hierarchy has to go. But... to take these documents, you need me? The Company needs you, not me. These are important documents. I understand. I'll go right away. Give it another thought... The magazine, Castilla. The guys, I don't... You are an example, Castilla! Shouldn't we talk to Silva, explain to him how Adalberto is? No way! He enjoys that. He likes to be important, a paladin of ethics, of honesty. Let him be. Well, he is like that, it's important for him. Give me a break, he's doing this to get more money from Silva. He plays martyr. He's not stupid. - You would do this. - Of course I'd do it. Hello, hello, hello, my princess. Hello, my love, hello! How are you? How are you doing? What a nice lifejacket you have! Hello Adriana. Marcelo. - What are you doing here? - Just passing by. In fact I followed you, yes I followed because I wanted to see my princess. I wanted to bring her this. Antonio! Open it. Let's see if you like it. Do you like it? Yes? Do you like it, my love? What a nice day! At least here the river is not contaminated. In Europe the rivers are a mess. At the Ebro you take a fish and he thanks you. "Thank you, guy, I was dying down there" What are you up to, princess? Will you eat the fish? If they are big, yes. If they are small, no, because Marcelo puts them back to the water. Really? Hey Marcelo, do you throw them back right away, or there is a special day for returns? Wednesday, for example. No, here in Parana river returns are on Thursdays. He throws them back. That's very good. Imagine how traumatic it is for the fish, my love. They get hooked from here, with a bent piece of steel. They cannot breathe... and are sent back to the water with a hole in their mouths. Do you do an execution ritual also? Yes, sometimes I do. Or I give them some anesthesia before sending them back. And then you give her "Finding Nemo". Antonio, can we talk? Of course. Stay here. Stay with Marcelo. You can tell he's full of tenderness. What are you doing here, jerk? What am I doing? I came to see my daughter. You mustn't be like that. You mustn't follow us all the time. Hold on Adriana, it's not like that. I just wanted to see my daughter, that's all. And to see you. I don't want to see you. You can see her on your days. The law always gives custody to the mother. You don't have the right to show up, or make fun of Marcelo in front of your daughter. I have the same right you had when you brought her back from Barcelona. - Not again! - I had to came back to this fucking country I had to flee. Abandon my career, a position that anyone would kill for. My salary goes from euros to pesos. Now I live in this shitty city and can only see my daughter when it pleases the judge's balls. Are those my rights? Sorry. I'll kiss her goodbye and leave. Ines, what are you doing here? Adalberto! Nothing, a mess of errands for my mother's pension. In half an hour I need to come back. Shouldn't we eat something nearby? Yes... No, I have to go back to work. But it's lunch time. Yes, but what are they going to think if they see us together? Because I said I wasn't going to eat, and now I show up having lunch with you. They'll think we ran into each other and had lunch. Hello. It's packed here, Ines. Look, here. What's that? A model boat? Yes, it belongs to my son. - He is a fan of these stupid things. - Isn't he too old for that? He's like that. He's... adopted. The song that you usually hum, It's "Venice without you", isn't it? Yes, that one. Do you like Aznavour? I'm sad at the thought... That In Venetla died The love that you swore for always to keep. What are you doing? Excuse me, Ines but, you know? I don't like the air conditioning blowing at me. - At my age I should avoid drafts. - At your age? May I ask you for a favor? Don't treat me so formal anymore, be more casual. How long have you known me? There's one condition for that. - That you also treat me casual. - Both. Both what? That we both should be casual. Right. - Okay. - It's a practice. You remind me of my father. To your... to your father? In some gestures, I adored him. He wouldn't say a bad word, either. Your last name was Austro-Hungarian isn' it? My father always wore a jacket, even in summer. This fabric is very thick, isn't it too warm? Not because of the jacket. I chose a wrong shirt. This morning my wife said... Today everybody is around. Ariel is a good guy. Good guy... Not always. Sometimes he's a bit fresh. Don't move. Stay. You know who you look like when you smile? Sean Connery! - Wasn't he bald? - What about it? Sean Connery is very attractive. I like him very much. You have the same dimples when you smile, I love that. It's hot now. Very hot. It's a little late, why don't we go Ines? You need to go to the bank and I have to work. - Okay, let's pay the bill. - My treat, my treat. Have it. Dessert. Such a strong emotlon... To recall yesterday When everything In Venice Was words of love Seeing my loneliness In the sunset Your haunting memory Is looking for me. What a sllent stillness What an endless grief How different Venlce Is If you're not with me. What did you do, Sari? Reiner brought it. Magda's boyfriend. He says you were at a bar, with a partner, and left. Did he say anything else? We need to talk, Adalberto. Your manager phoned. Silva. He told me everything. The money he offered you for the magazine. Do you realize how unscrupulous he is? Not at all, he seemed very good, very polite. He wanted to talk with me to see if I was more reasonable. This is going out of control. I'll talk to him. He mustn't call home. Dad! It's a fucking magazine that you didn't even know you had. - What little magazine? - It's true... How many times was I about to clean that closet and throw all that shit away? Don't tell me now that that magazine is important to you. Fundamental. Not important: Fundamental. My father is in it, and I'm not allowing a brat to think that I can be bought for a few pesos. Not so few. That money would pay for my trip with the rugby team. Buy him some clothes, he can't go to Australia looking like a beggar. Show him the folder, mom. Mother prepared a folder for you to take the magazine in. I can't believe this. Ayoung guy, who should be full of goals, fantasies, dreams, is ready to sell out for 5000 miserable pesos. 5000? The guy said 10,000! Yes, he said 10,000, Dad. I need to see Mr. Silva. He left, and he's not coming back. Tomorrow at 3:30 pm, is it okay? I've been calling him. I know he is refusing to see me. He called my home... Mr. Castilla, I said Mr. Silva is not in. He is not in. Tomorrow 3:30 pm. He will listen to me. Castilla, they told me you were looking for me. Where are you going? By my house, Italia and Montevideo. - I'm going that way. - No, I'm waiting. I'll take you, and you tell me. - There's not much space. - Yes, my little girl was here. - Wait, my legs! - Come on, get in. Down below, to your right. Isn't there a handle under here? My daughter came. She touches everything, Undoes everything. I turn on the radio and the wiper turns on. They told me you called me several times today. Mr. Silva. Frankly, I think it's mean of you to involve my wife in something that's our problem. This is not a problem, it's a business transaction. Let's do this. Maybe you don't care for money, congratulations for that, but you must care for other things. The Castilla's has always been a family of its word. My father was vice president, of the Jockey Club's Ethics Committee and consultant of many... Would you like a different proposal? Listen. Just listen to me. In two days someone must go to Buenos Aires... Would you like to go? All paid, of course. It's been a while since you went to Buenos Aires? It's been a long time since I don't get immersed in the smoke, chaos, noise, insecurity. Together with Ms. Ines, would you go... What do you think? People said you were having a drink with her, weren't you? That's vulgar, and it's disrespectful to Ms. Ines. No, not at all, she has to go on other errands. - I've confirmed she's going. - I'm married, Mr. Silva. Just think it over, Castilla. Imagine how it would be. It's a shame that I didn't skip Ethics at school, Mr. Silva. Thank you for your proposal, but I sleep in peace at night. I like to sleep in peace. Stop following us, psychopath! You have your days to see your daughter. And me, you don't have a reason to see me. - Did you listen to me? - No, Adriana. Adriana, I'm not following you. Stop that. I'm not following you, Adriana, I'm not following you. This is a small city. I didn't even know that you were ahead of me. - How are you, Adalberto? - I'll wait for you to have a drink? I have a while. But come on, let's chat in here. - I wouldn't want to disturb you. - Not at all, take a seat. I was just passing by and I wanted to thank you... for bringing me my things the other day. I was with a co-worker. - An airplane. - A little boat. The young lady, an airplane. I'm very happy for you. She's really beautiful, the lady, very nice. But I don't want you to think that I have... Adalberto, don't underestimate my intelligence. Look, I see it like this: After 20, 15, 8, 2 years of marriage, one realizes that instead of going to bed with the dear and affectionate wife, one would rather go to bed with the first woman at sight. See, you were thinking... Love doesn't have anything to do with it. It has to do with routine. I've been there I've been there. Look at it this way: The meal you prefer to eat is veal scallopini. Okay. Society now forces you to eat, nothing but scallopini. Over and over for centuries. But with time... you realize you have a deep unavoidable need to eat ravioli. So, you go to therapy and the Doc. Recommends to eat scalopini, with more oregano, less oregano, with jelly peach but what you really want to eat now, are ravioli, Adalberto. Ra-vio-li. Excuse me, there are some exceptions. My brother in law, Ernesto, has been married for 40 years. He told me... Say, For him, sex, has to be only with his wife. There is a character from Huxley, who said that Saint Francis of Assisi licked the sores to the ulcerous... - Did he lick their sores? - Yes, but not out of kindness. He did it because he was a pervert. There are perversions, Adalberto. There are perversions! Just a second. Please, hand over your work. Look at my skin, the bags under my eyes. The hair coming out of my ears. And I'm showing you only the tip of the iceberg. God knows. You didn't see me naked, Adalberto! Squalid legs covered in warts, completely varicose. That's why, if tomorrow Magda tells me: "The idea of touching you is unbearable, even with the tip of a stick", I must understand her. Because I have a mirror, don't forget. If she tells me that the tall guy, the dark-haired guy from the grocery, asked her to spend the night with him, what should I tell her? If I want her, value her, love her. I should tip the guy. - Teacher. - Yes? - May I ask you something? - Just a minute. The foundation of marriage, Adalberto, the foundation of marriage is infidelity. With no escapes, with no pressure valve, no man could stand the routine and boredom. No one. We'll keep talking some other day. Pick me up here and we can go for a drink. Sure. Let's pick a day. Give my regards to Magda, and, we can find a... Of course. Who knows. Turn off your light, Adalberto. Excuse me. Sorry. Ines, let me know when it's boiling. Wait Adalberto, I want to ask you something. Do you know anything about the trip to Buenos Aires? I don't know... Somebody told me about that. The manager told you, but you didn't say yes. He mentioned something, but I don't think I can go, because I have my son Rolito. Adalberto, it would be great if you went. To me, it's a vote of confidence if they send me there. Excuse me. Fuck! If we go, we should leave in the morning, You have a lot of things to do, and me, you can't imagine. If we go early, we'll do everything in the afternoon. At night we'll be ready to bed. Ready to bed... Sorry, I didn't mean that. If I said that, Adalberto. They told me that the Motel of the Company... Hotel. They say it's great. It's in a very good location. Please, go. If not, they'll send me with Torriglia... That jerk! Torriglia... Well, I think I can go. I need to organize a few things before, but I'll go. Great! I'll go tell them that you're going. We'll have a good time. Well, good time... It's a working day, isn't it? I would advice you to go, boss. What's that for? For your breath? Castilla. How do you do, young lady? Yes. I can see him. Could I speak with Mr. Silva? It's urgent. Castilla, the management sent you a ticket to fly to Buenos Aires. - Just a sec. - Sign, please. Tomorrow at 8:00 a taxi will pick you up from home. - Just a second! - Come on, I'm in a hurry. Sign it, please. I need to take it back. This is yours. See you. Are you okay, Adalberto? Adalberto! - What happens to you? - Give him some air! Is he an epileptic? Grab his tongue! - No, Asthma! You jerk! - Call a doctor! Calm down, a doctor is coming. Call Sarita. Hello. Mrs. Castilla, how is your husband doing? Much better, it was just a fright. Yes, the Company doctor said that he'll be back tomorrow. - Did he sleep well last night? - Not too well. He was worked up. What a shock! - Anyway, how are you? - Good... I don't know. Desperate, what can I say, I don't understand why he's so stubborn with that magazine. Your husband's attitude has upset the Board of Directors. I'm afraid they will do something drastic. I can't insist, not in his condition. The doctor said he shouldn't get stressed. Madam, I don't know what else I can do. I'll reconsider the offer. I'll give him $30,000 for the magazine. Ask for the loan from the Company? No! Sell the magazine to your boss? No! It's your son's future! It's your son's trip, the remodeling of this apartment, and the possibility of owning a car. How long since we had a car? I almost don't remember how to drive. Even Reiner, who is a teacher and has a miserable salary, is buying a car. Why don't we say "no", and wait until he offers $50,000? But, our life is comfortable. Roli was able to study, you never had to go to work. Because you never let me! I wanted to work, and I still want to. You wouldn't allow me. Magda is always asking me to work with her at the perfume shop. You must look after your son! Have you seen the hair in your son's legs? I don't need to be taken care of. And Casimiro? Who'd take care of him if you're at work? Will he be all alone? I'll take him to the store, Magda adores Casimiro. I swear, if you don't sell it to your boss, and remember he is your boss, the first thing I'll do is burn that fucking magazine, and then I'll take my things and go away. - And I'll start working! - What is Magda going to think, and Reiner, and all... And your mother? Nothing, they won't even notice. They aren't thinking about that fucking magazine. I'm leaving this place. Your son and I are leaving you! Telephone. For you. No, no. The doctor said he can go out. Just a second. Your daughter. I told her you're in. Tell her that I'm not here, that you were wrong. That I feel sick, or better: I'm showering. Hi Susi, I'm looking for him all over but I can't find him. Adalberto, she's going back to the South. She wants to talk to you. I don't know why. She thinks that one is doing nothing. - What do you have to do now? - Nothing... Things. How could I talk to her after the atrocities she told me? You kicked her out of the house, Adalberto! I didn't kick her out. I told her she couldn't go on like that. That she couldn't keep on living here that way. That was five years ago. The young lady was always questioning me. She kept repeating that I was a... How do you say that? That I was a fake! She was always tough, but you're that way, too. And about you? She said that you were empty headed. That you only cared about your clothes and having a car. No, that's not true, she never said that. About the car, I admit, she did say that. Hello Susi, just a second. He is looking for a spot in his agenda. And that lame guy, "The Bearded", who she's with, a run-down hippie who drives a motorcycle? - An artisan. - An artisan? Those horrible things he make out of wire? Dolls, chairs, donkeys. Junk. You never know what it means. A drug addict. A drug addict? Did you see him using? He always wore an ear ring. Don't hung up, Susi. He's shouting that he's coming. My nose is telling me they want money. She didn't call me for our anniversary, she calls up for money. Pick up the phone! Are you okay, Susana? You look well. A bit thinner, maybe. No, I'm always the same. - And the South, okay? - Good, dad. I wanted to ask you something. Well... Things are difficult at the Company, at home we have many expenses... I wanted to ask you to wait for "The Bearded". He's coming in a few minutes to say hi. You are still with him. - Yes - Good? A chaos like everybody, but he is a good guy. He's a monkey in the Chinese horoscope, you can imagine. But I didn't want to talk about him. It's something else. - I heard about that mess at your office. - At the Company? That you argued with your manager, kind of a yuppie. A yuppie, Susana. You made me feel proud, dad, and I want to see you. It's great to have a father who thinks that way, who opposes to imperialism. And this phony, capitalist society. See how the world is because there aren't more guys like you? You can't let people like that walk over you. My father, your grand father, always told me... "The Bearded" was very happy. He couldn't believe it. He says you are fabulous! "The Bearded"? A sensible guy, an artisan. He's still doing handicrafts? Those little wire handicraft? Those things? How did you tell him? Silva. His name is Silva. I told him: "There are things that you can't buy with money", and I left. - I'm going to the bathroom - Go ahead. Yes, from high school. No. That one was Pisani. Quique Jauregui. And how can I find him? Quique Jauregui. He was in the newspapers when he was studying Law. That one, do you remember now? Boastful. Always committed to something. Passionate. Argumentative, controversial. He drove the teacher crazy also arguing about the role of the masses. In front of everybody, he refused to bring the matt to the gym teacher. You were there, don't you remember? You weren't there? Where did you meet him? Wait, I'll write it down. Quique! You can't imagine how much I searched for you. I have a problem to solve. Well, I need... Your advice, I have a decision to make. Sell him the magazine and stop fucking around! Who made you believe that if you sold the magazine you were selling yourself? I thought you'd understand we where talking about principles, an ethical dilemma at stake here. What is a principle? - What is it? - I don't know. I'm asking you. What is it? A principle is... ...the foundation we are born with. Conditional reflexes. A way to show yourself, to gain people's affection. That is a principle. Nothing else. Cultural values instilled at childhood. Everything changes, culture changes, why not a principle? You think that, Quique? Adalberto! Yours is an epic tale something generational perhaps. Sell the magazine! Take the money! Buy a car for your wife! Send your son with the rugby team! - My daughter thinks that I shouldn't... - She'll understand. Especially if she understands that you were cornered. I'm sorry Quique. I thought it was pertinent. No, please, no. It's a pleasure seeing you. But sell him the magazine. Do you think that anyone will recognize something to you, if you don't do that? You are full of sadness You don't look the same You are another Venice Colder and greylsh The serene channel Of romantlc light Has lost the enchantment Involved in dreams What a sllent stillness What an endless grief How different Venlce Is If you're not wlth me The moon passing by Has lost Its glow How sad and lonely Is Venlce wlthout your love Thank you for the loan, Angelito, I enjoyed reading it. Do you need any money? I've saved some. No, is not that. Just problems at work. - Mother fucker - Angelito! Do you remember in the army, the guys teased you because you never swore? Say: "ass". Come on, say "ass". It's liberating. If you are having a bad time at work, you say: "fucking shit". Stop it, you know I don't like that. But it's good, it's liberating. Let's see, say with me. Fuck. Fucking shit and the mother fucker asshole. Isn't it too much, Angelito? I stepped on some shit. You know what's in my head, going back and forth? There is an advertisement in the newspaper, about a sail boat for $28.000. I went there, to see it. I have about $15,000. If I show them the money right there, I could have it for 24 or 25. Are you suggesting we buy it together? Together, of course. If you can. When I first saw you... That enlightened me. About the money... I don't know, maybe you can ask for a loan. I wouldn't even dream about that. Us, the Castilla, never owed money to anyone. That's one thing my father was proud of. Tell me Angelito, would you invest your savings in it? Of course, what would I want the money for? My pension is good, really good, from Provincial Water Company. I spent 40 years in that office. Really, and we could go to the island. To the island? To Montevideo, Uruguay. Casimiro! Not so far, come here. Look Angelito, let's do it. I'll get the rest. Are you serious Adalberto?! Come on Adalberto?! If my mother was here. She never let me swim in the pool cause didn't want me to get agitated. Asthma you know. The children were swimming, having fun. And I was just looking, on the side, with her. If she could see me now. Buying a boat. One should grab life's pleasures. Tell me something, because of my asthma, I don't know how to swim, wouldn't this be a problem with navy-police? - Mr. Silva, Adalberto Castilla - Castilla, what a surprise! Look! I thought it over, and I'm ready... to give you the magazine for the amount we've discussed. But... to do this is necessary that you assure me a basic matter. Tell me, Castilla, tell me. Absolute discretion. It's very important to me no one is to know. Please Castilla, don't take the magazine to the Company, Why don't you come to my apartment the day after tomorrow? Your apartment? If you like, come over between 7 and 7.30 and I'll give you the check. Sunday? Let's see. Yes. I can. But not in the afternoon, better at night, I could at 8.30. - Coke for me mom. - 8.30 is perfect Castilla. Very good, I'll be there. Congratulations on the decision, Castilla. How great, Adalberto, how wonderful! $30,000 for that magazine! Rolito! Call your trainer and tell him you'll go! Wait, wait, wait. Sit, come and sit. Do you realize son? You have to learn from experience in order to get a better price. The important thing is knowing how long to hold out. Be patient. Like when the Prussian Army. A genious is your dad, a genious. Adalberto, I was at Magda's looking at catalogs, now we can do a trip to the falls. We can go in our new car maybe. Like in Judo. You must use the strength of the adversaries. Magda called, about going for dinner tonight, with her and Reiner to that club where they met. I don't like him, Sari. But if you spoke with him all night on our anniversary. It's not here. Ok, lets go! They are going to use our table. Sari, we are looking for an apartment. You are moving in together? I believe that we are old enough, Sari. He sells his and I sell mine, and we buy one in front of Independence Park. A love nest. You know what this scoundrel has done? He went to the realtor and told the girl, a very serious girl, about 25 years old... She was very formal, and keep telling us the advantages that it had for older people. The park, the ice cream parlor, were nearby. We could sunbathe on the balcony. She only forgot to mention the Hospital was close, too. Suddenly he interrupts her and says: "Ms. We'd like an apartment, with a mirror on the bedroom ceiling, because we are used to going to Motels, and don't want to lose that feeling. She got red as a tomato. Bright red she was! When we were looking for an apartment, remember? I was pregnant with Susanita. Remember that? Adalberto didn't like any of them. And suddenly... he broke a shutter. Remember? It was so funny. He's sweet, so very caring, a little too sweet sometimes. Well, nobody is perfect. You know what he said the other day? That if I want to, we'll get married! Comfort has won me over, Adalberto. Comfort has won me over. I'm a widow, you know. That's why, soon, I know, when entering my home, I will smell casserole chicken, At home it will be nice and cool, because she has the air turned on. And there will be noises from the TV set. He brings me breakfast to bed. If he goes out, he always brings me something. The other day he came to the store, and started working at the register. You know what? He loves us to work together. How would I look with that, Magda? This? Independence and loneliness, are two faces of the same coin, Adalberto. - Why don't we dance? Lets dance - What happened, you got lost? - Lady's things - What have you done? Don't you dance? No, you go. Come on, have a little fun. Adalberto doesn't like dancing. You go, we'll stay. Ok, lets go dancing. Go, go. Would you like to dance, Sarita? Tell him that I made them specially for him. They're scones. Do you think he likes them? I don't know, Sari. He is my boss, not my card partner. How are you, Castilla? I was waiting for you. Leave your coat over there No, thanks, I'm in a hurry. My wife sends you these. Thanks. Come in. Over here. You have a very spacious apartment. Nice decoration. How nice, you brought the scones. People! See who is here? See, I had a real surprise for you. Come, come in. So, Castilla never parties with co-workers? Today he came, and brought scones. Would you like a drink, Castilla? Roman, get him a drink. - No, I came just for a minute. - Have a glass of wine... Come on, be nice, stay for a toast! No, they are waiting for me. Can we go somewhere else to finish with this? One second. Ricardo, lower the music. We'll have time to celebrate, thanks. I'll tell you what this is about. Castilla and I have a special situation. Very special. Something about a magazine. See Castilla? Everybody knows. Partly because you spread the news in the Company. Wouldn't you prefer to discuss this privately? Not at all. Ok, briefly. Like you know, there was this great coincidence. The number that I was missing to complete my collection, number 48, Castilla had it. But what happened? He couldn't let me buy it because, inside, there was a picture with a great deal of sentimental value for him, a great deal. An honorable attitude, very honorable. He even said that due to my youth, or as a businessman, there were things that I couldn't understand, as he understands them. An honorable man. But I applied the strategy of the stronger one: I insisted, insisted, and then, Castilla reconsidered his position, and showing healthy flexibility... I agreed to give it to him. Sell it, Castilla. Sell it to me. That was the deal. How much did you ask me? 20,000? 30,000, $30,000. Ah, $30,000. Castilla probably concluded one can put aside not all the principles, but some... I'll go to get the check Castilla. Because not all can be bought with money, according to Castilla, but the magazine, yes. It looks like a magazine can be sold. Would you give me the magazine, Castilla? Lets see, Silva, show it to us. Is your father's picture in it? No, later, the paper is old. It's best not to touch it a lot. As promised. Don't look at me like that, Castilla. I admire you. You got the best price for the magazine. Write it down, those who make deals for the Company: Castilla negotiated for a price with such ability, that it always was as if he didn't speak of money. Don't leave me with my hand out, Castilla. Take it. It's yours in good faith. Can you believe what he did? Was I wrong? I gave him what he asked for. That's all. Play the music! Fatiga! How unusual you coming at this time. I was leaving any minute. Sit down. What are you having? Lets share a beer. No, no. Before, I used to drink beer. But not now it's not good for me. Maybe a cup of tea. We must celebrate. Hold onto yourself! I put a deposit on the sail boat! What's wrong? Aren't you happy? No, yes, yes. What happens is... - Do you want to ask? - A beer here, a tea here for my friend. No look, wait. 'Ll better have beer with you. Then, bring us a beer. Or it's better a pitcher of beer? Casimiro, shut up! Adalberto! Where were you? I was... ...with a friend from the Army, I haven't seen since '85. Angelito. Do you remember him? The drunk! You were with the drunk! Adalberto, it's 1:00 am. Stop it Sari, you'll wake Roli up. But you see. I was worried and called everybody up. Almost call the police Don't make a big deal. But God. What did you drink? What did the drunk give you? Don't say that. He had low pressure that day, he wasn't drunk. Come, come. We had prepared a toast with our son, and you went with your friend, Adalberto. Well, its ok, its over. Tell us, how did everything go? Oh fine. Good, good Sarita But tell me. Did you see Silva? Was he happy? Did he give you the check? I gave it to him Sarita. I had to give it to him. What? I had to. No, tell me that it isn't true. Tell me it isn't true or I kill you. What are you doing? The jerk of your father gave the magazine away. No... And overall, he is drunk. Are you drunk, Dad? No, no just dizzy, Roli. Something I ate. - Ajoke - Not really Tell me it's a joke Adalberto, a joke. Sari stop it, I'm going to bed. Stop it, I say stop it. I say stop it! I'll tell you everything tomorrow, Sari. Don't you see? Stop it, I say stop it. It's not a joke. I'll leave. Lets go son! Where are we going now? It's 1:00 am, stop it! To a hotel, I don't know. To the South with your sister. Calm down, Sari. Tomorrow I'll explain everything. What about tomorrow? What do we have to talk about? You have deprived us of a good life. Now you come home drunk. The next step is you beating us. Stop! Does he sells it? No, he gives it away. His wife and son doesn't matter at all. Don't worry, don't worry, son. I'll get the money for your trip, Roli. You are important to me. Sarita? Roli? Sari? Roli? Sari? Rolito? Casimiro? Hello. Torriglia, do you have a second? The old man asked for a loan? For $25,000. $25,000? Hey, he seems sad. A bit gloomy. - And they'll give him $25,000? - It's done, he got it right away. May we ask for that much here? I don't know why he doesn't ask Silva for the check again. Because he has dignity. What the shit does he want that money for? What is this man doing here? Reiner, did you tell him I was here? Don't look at me, Sarita. But what does he think? With a flower's bouquet. - Sara. - But what do you think? You are going to solve something? - See, how easy? - Sari, please. Reiner can you tell the gentleman that this is not a Hollywood movie. Where after he does everything wrong, he goes, and gives the lady a speech. And the lady, since she is stupid in the movie, forgives him and they kiss. And that's the end. - That's what you expected? - No dear, no. I don't know what speech you're going to give me... I've seen this movie already. What will you tell me? You'll tell me all my defects, and that that is just what you like most about me? Yes, dear, but also... I don't know what are you going to say... That you are alone? Is it that? That you miss me? That you need me? That after a marriage with a lot of shit and many years, it's worth it to stay together? And out of routine, you didn't realized that you love me a little? Or... I don't know. With flowers you are coming to say. What? What are you trying to show me? Yes, nice, it's nice. But I'll keep working. I agree. Even if you don't agree. I'll keep working. Ok, but I agree anyhow. And... He was a good guy. He paid for the magazine at last. I told you he was a good guy. Well, it wasn't like that. Would you teach me how to drive? Do you think so? But isn't it dangerous? There are so many taxis. - Will you teach me or not? - Lf you like, yes. But... And Roli? I went on and paid for his trip. It was the first thing I did. Did you get the loan? Because I asked you about the car and Roli's trip? - Did you go into debt, Adalberto? - That's my problem, Sari. Do you remember I told you I got together with Angelito? The drunk. I did like to see him again, you know? I would like him to come home one day. Of course. When did I forbid you to bring your friend? In 1985. You have the right to bring him home. And now, we could take our trip to the falls with the car? No, not that. We won't do that trip. How long has it been since we did something together? Look, Sari, maybe it's like you say: "How long since we did something together?" But it doesn't need to be a trip. Does it need to be something short like that? We can take Casimiro out together. We can go to the movies. We can take a walk. We can have breakfast in front of the river. I could pick you up after work, and go for a coffee. We don't need a trip to be together, Sari. It's the worst proposal that I ever heard. But I love it, and I'm glad you said that. Maybe we could go on a trip. But not to The Falls. We can go to the South, to visit Susana. Are you coming, Adalberto? No, Ines, I don't like those parties. Specially after the other night. Come on, Adalberto. It's a new year. Well, just for a little while. We began to speak of sexual fantasles. Leaning on the car, and it was very strange. The girl very quickly... Look. Very good, eh. Very good. You know what it is? Yes, it's a, a... What is it? A lizard! A lizard? Yes, I thought so. I see you met my daughter, Castilla. Oh, it's a lizard! How nice, princess. - Would you save it for me? - Yes. How beautiful. We'll leave soon. Dad gives a speech and we'll go. Ok, my love? I see you are still upset with me, Castilla. Very sorry if what I've done was so wrong, I didn't... It was cruel. It's true. But not as bad as for you not talking to me, or not coming to the office when I called you. Look Castilla, I know you asked for a loan, and I personally authorized it. I want you to know that, I still want to pay for the magazine, and forget about the check you tore apart. Listen, stop Castilla, I have my limits as well. I don't need your money, Mr. Silva. It doesn't seem so, Castilla. It doesn't seem so. Everybody, everybody! A minute of attention! Thanks a lot. I'll be short. I know that you all want to talk or go home, and not listen to your boring boss. I want to thank you, for your cooperation. In very short time we made this Company grow, and took it out from the standstill it was suffering. I think that we all are collectors. - Can you pick me up? - Without knowing it, we collect in our memory, moments and people. I don't want to get sentimental, but I want you to know, that in my collection, this branch has a special place, along with the people who work here. And I want to focus my gratefulness, in one of you in particular: An employee, who gave me the opportunity to complete a collection very important to me, beside giving me a great story to tell. He knows very well who he is. And many of you know it as well. Then. Happy New Year! I forgot something: Starting on February 10th... Excuse me. Sorry for interrupting. I only wanted to ask you one thing. What do you think is the price of this? From your point of view. What are you doing? Did you take the drawing as a hostage? No, I explained myself incorrectly. How much does this cost, in your opinion? Well, its my daughter's drawing, at least a million dollars. No, don't laugh. You know that a good seller fixes the price according to the buyer. And you know very well that I asked for a loan from the Company. So how much would you sell it for? Really. Listen, Castilla, let's finish with this. Don't be silly again. 5000? 10,000? I would like your daughter to see how you change her drawing into money. Stop, Castilla, don't cross the line. I'm offering a commercial deal. You don't have a reason to get upset. 20,000? 30,000? I think that, coming to this number, your daughter would ask you to sell it. But tell me. No, I better say, tell her. She can do other drawing, even a similar one. But you, aren't you ready to sell it? Stop, Castilla. Shall I take that as a "no"? I was right then, not everything is to be sold? Even for somebody like you, not everything has a price? I really thank you, Silva. Due to the magazine, I regained things that even I didn't know I had lost. I don't have to say which ones, cause you wouldn't understand. I won't bother you anymore. Happy New Year! Wait, Adalberto! What would you have done if he'd told you "yes"? - Lf he would have sold it to me? - Yes. Imagine he would have said: "Okay, $30,000". I don't have... the least... ...fucking idea. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
