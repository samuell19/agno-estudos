Breakfast is where my money is. - Yeah, I promise- - And he said, Louis what are you doing? He says, Sheriff I am taking out to bury. I said Louis, you don't bury a dead cow. You eat a dead cow.

You shouldn't be telling that- - Seth. - Pop, um, I was thinking about, you know we talked last month. About me going to school in New York for painting? - Community college at Saranac is almost free. You could stay here. - Right well, I've been looking into this financial aid and- - Seth, what are you going to do with a college degree in painting? - Kristen got into NYU. (sigh) Well this financial aid. This financial aid see- - Means I gotta sign something that says I can't support my family. - No pop, it ain't like that. - It ain't huh? Let me tell you something Mr. That governor we got, let's my tax dollars get sucked down that through way, like a drainpipe opening into a sewer. And people down there sit on their lazy butts and get rich off of my sweat. - Pop it's not welfare. Look I'll pay the money back myself. - I can't even get you to do the dishes around here. No I am sorry, I will not take handouts. - Jesus pop, why's everything got to be such a pain in the ass with you? - Excuse me, that language is not allowed at my dinner table. - Our dinner table pop. There are two other people that live in this fucking house with you. - Sally, go to your room.

With cans of rite guard. (laughing) They would like spray it at me, like in my face. And like I showered everyday you know? But it didn't matter. And you know like, the only one in the entire grade that stuck up for me was Kyle Turner. He was great man. He could like, make me laugh so hard 'cause like the way he used to put up with Marty's shit. He could be like so vicious. - Yeah - And I mean like, god, we would like we would just talk forever about, about just everything. - Yeah. Kyle was different. Seems like, I don't know.

And no one gives you shit about it. - People give you shit. People are always giving you shit. I look out here, all I see is all this innocence and big skies and- - Have you ever seen, a cross burning? Yeah, I have. - Look man, don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Please, The Cosby's were great role models? - For who? - Yo even my father watched The Cosby show. - Nobody lives like that in the city. Not even the white folks. Now Good Times. - Haha, yeah, all right. What, aint' we lucky we got it. - I mean Good Times, right. Now Good Times I always thought it had. It said more for the African American experience. - Yo Kid Dynomite, African American? - Yeah, yeah you know, kinda like how you must relate to Jethro, The Beverly Hillbillies. - Aight.

What are you doing here? - Nothing. - Where's Kristen? - I don't know. - Bull shit. She didn't come home last night and neither did you. Your father told me. Where is she? - I don't know. - Come here. Up here. I don't know what's going on between you two. But I don't you're the reason she's passed up that scholarship. And I know you know where she is. Now where is she? - Sir, I swear I don't know. Just came by to tell her I was sorry about something. - Here. - Francine? - Yeah, hun. - You never went to college, did you? - No, I didn't. But I did spent two years wandering around Europe when I was about your age. Your mom always told me I learned more in two years than she did in four. - Why'd you come back here? - 'Cause I wanted to. - Why would anybody want to? - Seth, me and your mom came back here 'cause we'd been away. Your dad never has. That's why there were troubles between them. Your mom, she was something else. - I don't want to be here anymore. - Then don't be. - Kristen! I thought I might find you here. I ugh, I remember how you used to like it here. You know your parents are going crazy looking for you. You really shouldn't be out here alone. - Have you seen Seth? - I have something I want to show you. It's okay. That's that guy that they're looking for. Who murdered all those people in New York City. I think Seth knows where he is. I think, something's wrong with Seth. - Seth and I are getting married. - Seth? Who the hell are you? - Where's Seth? - He's at work. Wait. Hey, hey. Hey. - Don't hurt me. - I won't. - Please just let go. - H-hey, who are you? - No one. - She'll come around Sid. Kids that age just need space. - Eh. - When she was a little girl she used to tell us when the sky was blue. And how you wouldn't know we were her parents. - I remember when you and Pete were in high school, you wanted to join the Navy. Well your parents raised an awful stink. - Told the recruiter we were 19, weren't even 17. (laughing) - Yeah, my pa was so mad, wouldn't speak to me for the rest of my senior year. - Hell mine packed my bags. (laughing) - I don't know, seems to me you can't let your kids run too wild. I should talk. But Seth, Seth's a good kid. Takes good care of his sister. It's just a whole lot different nowadays raising kids. So many rules. (country music) - What about your pops man? - Thursdays he hangs it with his crew in town. He won't be back 'til late. Yo Sally, it's time to wash up. - [Sally] Okay. You better not be in my room. - [Sally] I'm not. - So mom and dad (coughing) get this poor frozen animal. And they end up putting it back in the boat they go back to the car. They end up driving like two hours to get back down here. And they end up putting it in Francine's meat locker for like five months, next to the frozen hamburger patties, I swear to god. No, I know. - You making this up man. - No, I swear to god it was, it was nasty man. - Liar. I swear your lying. - Can you pass the corn? (indistinct) - Um, Knowledge. - Mm-hm. - When you get out of jail, can you come live here? - I don't know. - Hey, what are those? - Nothing. - Were you in my room? - No. - Hand them over. - They're not yours anyway. - Wh-what are those of? - Nothing. It's just a friend. That's all. - Who's the little boy? - Um, excuse me, all right. - Sally? - Yeah? - I may be having to go away for a little while, on a trip. And I don't want you to tell daddy about it. But um, I promise I'm going to be back, soon. - Are you going with Knowledge? - Maybe? Is that okay about dad? - Yeah. (rap music) - Yo man, you're bugging dude. - Yo man, come on. Don't be such a Herb shit, you know? Come on yo, you gotta loosen yourself up. - Who you calling a Herb? Huh, oh. Oh, oh I'm black so I'm supposed to be able to know how to dance right? - Hell yeah. - Look, I know how to dance, aight. I just, you know. I ain't doin' it in front of people, that's all. - Come on, move your damn feet. This shit is supposed to be part of your culture. You know that- - Fuck off. What the fuck you know about my culture? - Wow, all right. (laughing) - All right, aight, aight. Oh shit. - You pushed me man. I feel stupid. - Well you look stupid. Now move man. Come on, aight.

(slow jazz music) - I think that's Ron Carter on the bass. - Wow. - What? - Nothing. - It's beautiful. When I was ugh, 13 there was this kid who disappeared in the woods up here. Wandered away from his family's camp. No one could find him. They tried for weeks. Helicopters. Infrared detectors. Dogs. You name it, they used it. But they still couldn't find this kid. And it was like, all of a sudden this place that people thought was so beautiful, turned into this monster that could swallow you up. And then, couple weeks later my dad caught me foolin' around with some friends. This guy Marty and this other guy Kyle. He said it was real bad. He said that if I was ever bad like that again something like what happened to that kid c-could happen to me. - Yeah. Yeah. In my hood right, if you're black and you're a fag you're just a fag. I met Tyrone in high school. A few years ago. He used to intimidate everybody man. Except me. We swore, you know, that we'd never tell nobody. Because we were just scared, you know? They got these um, they got these counselors over at Black Brook. They just, they just want to know everything about you, you know? They want to know who you are and who you were and... They just want to break a nigger, you know? And I didn't give them nothin'. I'm not giving my shit to nobody. I'm going to go back to the cabin. - No, no. No. You can sleep here. You know it's just, I'm not really used to it. - What about your pops man? - Nah, he won't he won't come in here. He hates it in here. - Night Seth. (knocking) - Doris. Kristen are you okay?
