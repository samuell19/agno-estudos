(MultiCom Jingle) (bouncy, adventurous music) - We have assembled once more here at Sun City to bestow our most honored award, as judged by the greatest, and most knowledgeable exponents of the art. This award for outstanding merit, for outstanding achievement in both physical and mental coordination will now be presented to the one person deserving of its symbol. (yelling) (yelling and grunting) (woman screaming) (yelling and grunting) It will be of little surprise to you all to learn the name of this year's winner. A man known to us all for his remarkable, his amazing innovations in this, the highest of all the arts. (yelling) (yelling and grunting) (yelling) Now I ask you ladies and gentlemen to please join us in toasting our guest of honor. Holder of eight world titles in marshal arts, four times world champion, and new record, Mr. Steve-- (yelling and grunting) (yelling and grunting) Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Steve Chase. (yelling) - [Man In Audience] Why that's Steve Chase. (women screaming) (crowd laughing and applauding) - I really hate these affairs. - What kind of affairs do you like? - [Steve] The kind you are certainly suited for. - Mr. Chase, you saved me from a most embarrassing scene. - Just look what you have done, monsieur. - Send the bill to my suite. - To mine please, I insist. Those men assaulted me, and if it weren't for Mr. Chase-- - This soiree was the piece de resistance, Mr. Chase shall get the bill. - (sighing) You set that up, Miss Kane. - How do you know my name? - I got it from the hotel register. Kandy Kane with a K. - Well, I had to see for myself how good you really were. (clearing throat) Shall we continue our conversation in your suite? - I don't have a suite. - But, but the maitre d said that-- - He'll be as surprised as you are. Your suite? - Perhaps you'd like to hear a word or two from Mr. Chase. - Thank you very much. (crowd applauding) - [Steve] Imported. - [Kandy] My one weakness. - Everybody should have at least one. I have other weaknesses that come first, Miss Kane. - Please call me Kandy. - Sounds delicious. Related to the missing Nobel Prize winning chemist Dr. Horatio Kane. - [Kandy] He's my father. - Been missing two months I believe. - Not just missing, kidnapped in fact. (piano key clicking) (tense, suspenseful music) - Somebody else must be interested. This'll give them somethin' to listen to. - Ah! - Has there been a ransom note or anything? - My father has been working for several years on a project to extract fuel from potatoes. One year's crop can provide enough gasoline to drive every car in the world to the moon. - Solve the parking problem. - [Kandy] Mr. Chase this is no laughing matter. - You mean to tell me the good doctor was kidnapped because of potatoes? - During his research, my father accidentally discovered there was a byproduct. An incredible new mind control drug that enables whoever administers it to bend people to his will. (knocking at door) - Room service, champagne for the lady. - I've already received it. - This one's complements of the house. (dramatic music) - Must've been domestic. (yelling and grunting) Is he one of yours or one of theirs? (yelling) (gasping) - Steve no, these gentlemen are here to help me rescue my father. - It's for the good of the world. - We want to stop this terrible drug from spreading further. - My father's held in a village in the mountains. The whole town is under control of the drug. - If the army went in it'd be killed, is that it? - The whole world is at stake in effect. - It'll be expensive. - Oh we are men of considerable means. Shall we say two million, plus expenses? - Five million. I'll pick up my own expenses. - It's a deal. - I'll need help. Four good men I can rely on. - Anybody you choose. - I know you and I can rescue him. - One more condition. The girl stays here. (piano keys banging) (door closing) (yelling) - Cous. - Sensei Steve, welcome, can we help? - I'm looking for The Fly. - I would suggest you see Sensei Tonaca, the master of masters. (yelling) - Tonaca Sensei. I'm here to see The Fly. - He has found satori. - You mean he knows I'm searching for him? - Yes. - I must find him, sensei. - Be careful. (door creaking shut) (tense music) - You won't come. - Your outer eye sees clearly. - You must be tired of playing games. - Your inner eye is equally aware. (grunting) - This time the game is serious. - I know, it's a game between tigers and dragons. A game in which both sides bleed, profusely. (yelling) - [Sensei] Ready. (yelling) (car horns honking) Ready. (crowd chattering) (grunting) - [Man In Crowd] Pull together. (grunting) (crowd chattering) (grunting) (crowd laughing) (grunting) (men cheering) - Go on Gorilla, put him in a headlock. - [Man In Crowd] Go on, go, go, you can do it. (grunting) - Steve Chase, you son of a gun. (yelling) (laughing) That ain't funny, what's the big idea? - That color really suits you, you know that? (Steve laughing) I'm got a job for you. - I already got a job. - Yeah but this is kinda more in your line. - I've got a good thing going now. And since they banned me from pro wrestling. - Banned you? - Yeah, every time I beat a guy, I bite his ear off. I just couldn't help it. - Some how Gorilla, I just can't imagine you spending the rest of your life on a construction crew. - Oh I'm trying to get some money to get me back to Jamaica. And besides, it has got, what do you call it? - Security? - Yeah, that's the word. - Yeah, but I never thought I'd hear you say it. - I didn't, you did. - Hey, coffee break's over. Playin' games with half my crew. Get back to work or you're fired. - You wouldn't have the guts. - [Foreman] Oh I wouldn't huh, you're fired. - You can't fire me, I just quit. - I fired you first. (yelling) - [Gorilla] I quit first. - I fired you first. - Come again. - You quit first, sir. (foreman groaning) - Ah, my old buddy! Say, the color suits you too. (twangy, bouncy music) - Hey. - Huh? - You know where I can find a guy named Gypsy Billy? - What do I look like, the yellow pages? Past that truck, first alley on the left. (twangy, bouncy music) (upbeat pop music) * Well I gotta get the world off of my back * Or pretty soon I'm gonna crack * So I gotta get the world off my back (patriotic music) - Gypsy, Gypsy Billy. Hey Gyp, come on Gyp, I know you're in there. It's me, Steve. (chickens clucking) I need your help. - Go away, I'm retired. - Come on Gyp, this is a chance for you to get back on your feet. - A mission? - The biggest yet. - Naw. - Come on Gyp. - Oh! Ah, it wouldn't work. I couldn't help a one-legged widow fall down the stairs. - I'm not taking no for an answer, you're coming with me. - I'm not in shape for any big mission. - All you need to get back into shape is a good bath. - Okay Steve, okay, but I'm warning you, you're makin' a big mistake. - It wouldn't be the first time but I'll take the chance. He's just left. - Don't let the gate hit you on the way out. - Hey what about my security deposit? Two bucks, I gave you five. - Took it out for damages. - You gonna let him get away with that? - He's got the franchise. - It's now or never, Gyp. - Vampire you damn thief, give me my dough. - Let go of me. - You heard me, my five bucks. (whistling) (yelling and grunting) (sighing) Thanks for the help. - Did you really want help? - (labored breathing) Nope. - Our satellite took these pictures of the town. A place called Ironville. - Your satellite? - Anyone with enough money and a charitable heart can purchase a satellite from NASA and program it to photograph the earth. - Naturally. - Lights out please. - [First Gentleman] The drug subjects the user to the will of one man. - And if the user is mechanical, the fuel gives 1000 miles to the gallon. - All this from potatoes? - Potato fuel has a great advantage over fossil fuels. - Every year more potatoes. - Exactly, you've heard of Wellington Forsyth the third, haven't you? - Billionaire that dropped out of sight years ago. - Supposedly lost on an archeological expedition. He calls himself Marduk now, after the Babylonian God. He's managed to attract an impressive number of followers and uh, well thanks to Kandy's father and his discovery, he now holds the entire city under his control. - [Steve] Including Dr. Kane himself. You know where they're holding him? - He's in there, he's Marduk's prisoner. We must get dad out of there before the government tries a desperate rescue attempt and fails. - You wanna stop anyone from gettin' the formula. - It's debatable who will use the formula for more evil ends, our government or Marduk. - [Steve] How did you get these shots of him? - [First Gentleman] Marduk has a weakness for pretty girls. One of our lady operatives is a photographer in his camp. - How do we get to Ironville? - Our private jet will take you as close as possible, then you use the back roads. Marduk has spies everywhere. Now we prepared a map. Some of the dirt roads may be difficult to follow, but you should get there unnoticed. - You must be prepared for anything, Marduk is very shrewd. - Steve, this is gonna be a tough job. I think we should recruit Hotdog with his bag of tricks. - And Mr. Chase, we urge you to take Kandy. She can be an invaluable asset. - Look upon it as our way of ensuring that our investment carries out his side of the contract. - Sorry gentlemen, we're going in without women. It's Marduk and me. (dramatic music) (camera shutter clicking) - Thank you, thank you. (bold drumming music) (yelling) (yelling and grunting) (groaning) (yelling and grunting) (dramatic tone) - Congratulations, once again my loyal warrior, you have proved yourself to be the Optimus, the best of the best. Dedicated to our eternal quest for unparalleled perfection. And so shall you remain, until one even better can vanquish you. - Honey child. - [Marduk] What is it, Minerva? - I have news, angel face. - What news? And I wish you wouldn't all me those names. At least not in front of the ladies. - The ladies? He's coming, they convinced him. - Wonderful. At last, a real challenge for the Optimus. If Mr. Steve Chase survives. - And now for the bad news. It's the doctor, he says he must see you. - How presumptuous of him. Dr. Kane is summoning me? - At once, he says. - I summon people to me, they come to me. - He's out of control honeysuckle, I think the drug's worn off. - He may need reinforcement, take me to him. (bold, adventurous music) - [Citzens] Marduk. Marduk. Marduk. (drumming music) Marduk. (bold drumming music) - What's all this nonsense about you're summoning me? - I know Marduk, it was on the news. I'm not here of my own free will, I've been kidnapped. Why did you kidnap me? - I assure you Dr. Kane, your fears are groundless. Pure paranoid postulation. I invited you here for the good of mankind. This community is a model for a new society, a perfect civilization that will one day cover the face of the earth. As soon as the drug is ready for oral application, remember? - You want to introduce the drug into the world's water supplies? I must help you rule the world? (tense music) - When will Operation Water Supply commence? - In five days. - My patience is running out, injections are too clumsy. - It will be ready, I assure you. (tense music) - See that this citizen receives reinforcement every five days instead of weekly. There's something terribly wrong here. We don't know how long he's had a free will. Move him and the lab immediately, and search the place top to bottom. - We'll turn it upside down, buttercup. - Okay round number six, place your bets. (man laughing) Round number six, okay round number six. Place your bets gentlemen please, place your bets. Last of the big time spenders all under one roof (laughing). Round number six. You guys ready? (striking) (exploding) (gunshots firing) (glass breaking) - Oh, leap! - That's our Hotdog. - I'm not ready to die yet. - (chuckling) Then you're not ready to live, turkey. Okay, round number seven. Last one to chicken out gets it all. Place your bets gentlemen please, place your bets. Nobody move. (gunshots firing) (glass breaking) - Hasn't changed a bit. - Round number eight, come on fellas let's see some more of the green stuff. Place your bets. Ah, ah, ah. (bouncy, whimsical orchestral music) Hotdog. Round number eight. (gun firing) - Got my leg, help me. (laughing) Wait til, wait til I'm out. Wait, wait til I'm out. (whirring) - Steve. Steve baby. - How you doin' buddy? - Gypsy. Gorilla (laughing). Hey you guys go on without me, I got business. Well, the old gang together again. I never believed it would happen. - [Man] All right, round number nine-- - Yeah but where's The Fly? Hell The Fly's missing. - Do you know where he might be? - Huh, oh no now wait a minute Steve, are you assembling again? Well count me out, kid, far out. You're too dangerous. (gun firing) (glass bottle shattering) - [Man] Look out, will ya? (glass bottle breaking) - Hey you guys, I passed this one. You're only allowed to shoot each other. It's damn hard to teach these guys a new game. - Hey, are you gonna come with us or not? - Well actually Steve I'm a little busy right now, I gotta couple of numbers to (coughing). - Hotdog, you are coming with us. - Easy buddy, you're always on pins and needles. - [Gorilla] Well? - Well, since you love me so much, what are we waiting for? - That's better. (Gorilla and Hotdog laughing) - [Man] Okay guys, round number 10. Chip in or ship out. You got nothin' to lose except your life. (bullets rattling) - [Flight Attendant] Hors d'oeuvres sir? - What are those for? - [Flight Attendant] Something for you sir? - No thanks. Oh you'll see, might come in handy. - [Flight Attendant] Hors d'oeuvres? - So, what about The Fly? - We're goin' in without him. - [Hotdog] You're kidding? - [Steve] Look he's achieved satori and doesn't wanna join us. I've given up chasing ghosts. - Hey come on, that's not our style, Steve. Either we go in as a team or we don't go at all, right? - Don't get exited. - Who's excited? Just because you're eight times world champion-- (banging on door) - Four times. - [Pilot] Hey hold your horses, will ya? I'm holding mine. Hey man what're you doin', are you crazy? I can't believe this, damn animal. I'm gonna quit this stinkin' job. - Sir, what are you doing? - I couldn't wait any longer. - Please excuse him, ma'am. He's never flown in an airplane before. - Oh I thought maybe he'd never been let out of the zoo before. - Well actually we bribed his keeper. - Steve. - Hi sweetheart, you included in the price of the ticket? - What are you doing here? I thought I told you the four of us are going in alone. - It's our plane, our money. I'm entitled to come along if I want to. - You're really cute, you know that? Look, I accepted this job subject to certain conditions. So I'm turning this plane around and it's your choice who gets off at the other end. - Listen Steve Chase, I'm here for a reason. I know where you could find The Fly. I can't make him come along but I can take you to him. Possibly he'll listen to you. But I must, I wanna see my father. - Oh come on Steve, she's already on board, you can't send her back now. - Okay Duchess, let's see how smart you are. Lead us to The Fly. (slow, high-pitch flute music) - Welcome Steve, I was expecting you. Sit. (slow, gentle wooden flute music) - I know you see me, but do you hear me, Fly? Okay, come on Fly, I need your feet. There are many lives at stake here. - For this mission, feet alone are insufficient. The mind that leads the feet needs to be wise. (light, rapid drumming music) - Another one of your games, Fly? - Perhaps only a game of illusion, perhaps real. Can you match me? (light Eastern music) A true leader finds a way around any obstacle. I'm sorry, I cannot follow you. (light Eastern music) How did you manage this illusion? - What illusion, Fly? - You lead, I'll come. (bold, adventurous music) - Okay everybody, let's take a break. - Question, why is the soft lady traveling with warriors? - To sew holes in the socks. - Hey you guys, she oughta be sitting in the back, not me. - Hotdog, where is your sense of, what's the word, Steve? - Chivalry? - Yeah. - Oh yeah, look who's talking, Captain Midnight who sits up front. - Ah-ah. - Don't worry gentlemen, I can hold my own. - In any case Kandy, I better teach you some of the basics. Right after you prepare breakfast. (yelling in unison) - Martial arts are built on tradition, which the trained warrior must learn to master just as the physician masters his skill. And if the student is instilled with the forms and techniques, he learns to break the chains of tradition. - [Citizens] Marduk. - Martial arts must first be graceful, elegant. And only then can they be potent. The student begins to become one with the spirit of his art. Lending a new creativity to his every movement. - Thus he acquires the new freedom. A transcendence of the physical and intellectual being. (yelling) - No wasted motion. No wasted energy. Every flick of the finger must have a meaning. Every step. (exhaling) Every breath. Even the slightest flick of the head. (yelling) Then there's the element of surprise. (groaning) (laughing) (Kandy yelling) I should've known. - [Announcer] Attention all citizens, attention. Supervised recreation periods will henceforth be of 1/2 hour duration on alternate days only, that is all. - Operation Intercept has been activated. - Marvelous, the first test for the great Steve Chase. - Leave it to us, pumpkin pie. - You must learn to stop calling me these names, Minerva. - Oh, you're absolutely right, chuckles. - Chuckles, chuckles, ah-ha, chuckles, chuckles, ah-ha. (upbeat country guitar music) - Sure sounds like a rough joint. Let's take a look inside you guys, we might learn something. - [Man] Okay Steve. - And hey, keep your eyes open. - [Man] House of merriment usually breeds trouble. (upbeat country music) - Hey friend, do you know of a place around here called Ironville? - Don't believe we've met. - As a matter of fact we haven't, we're kinda new around here. - How come you called me friend? - Seemed like a friendly kinda thing to say. - Around here, it's only our friends that're allowed to call us friend. - Then how about hey, you know of a place around here called Ironville? (upbeat country music) - Hotdog. - I'd like to buy everybody a drink. - [Crowd] Ooh! (crowd chattering) - I'd like to buy you a drink. (crowd groaning) - [Man In Crowd] I'm gettin' outta here. - I'm feeling extra generous today, I'd like to buy you another drink. (glass shattering) (crowd chattering) Oh-wee. (groaning) (yelling and grunting) (gagging) (yelling) (yelling and grunting) (yelling) (yelling and grunting) - Ironville, friends, isn't signposted. Just take the road into the mountains and you'll hit it. (glass crashing) (bartender groaning) - [Announcer] Attention all citizens, attention. Group seven report for reinforcement therapy in 1/2 hour. Due to reduced productivity, group 11 will be on short rations for the remainder of the week. Those are the orders of the great Marduk. That is all. - Hey you, come here. Documents. Says here you're with group eight. - Yes. - [Guard] Why aren't you with 'em? - I've been sent on an errand. - Without a class A permit? - I have a class A permit. - [Guard] It's not here. - I must've lost it. - That's against the rules. I'll let you go this time-- - No you won't. No class A permit allowing him to venture forth separated from his group. You must of course be disciplined. - Of course. - Report directly to the holding center. Tell them that you are to serve one week solitaries on zita rations. - Yes sir. - Infallible, perfect control. As for you. (crying out) (man thudding on ground) Next time you'll lose your elite status. (car horn beeping) What is it? - Operation Intercept, the fight in the bar. - [Marduk] Did we defeat them? - No, they won. - How close are they? - Oh less than a day's travel. - Effect plan B, elite ground core, and put all other units on alert. Operation Water Supply begins in three days. - Sure thing, dimples. (slow, gentle music) - Great work in that fight, I was really impressed. - Thanks. - It's kinda curious, you know. - What is? - The way you handle yourself, sorta like an expert. - I wanna be prepared, the same way you want them to be prepared. - Sure, but to us it's a way of life. - By the way I'm, I'm sorry. - About what? - Not telling you that I could fight. It's just, you never really asked me. - It's not exactly the kinda question a guy asks a girl. - You're not upset? - No, as a matter of fact, your stock just went up a couple of points. (whistling) - Question, why is soft lady making mush? (men laughing) (adventurous music) - There's nothing on the map that looks like this. It's almost as if it had been changed. - This crossroads looks like it's been here for years. Hey! - What can I do for you folks? - We seem to be lost. You know anything about a town up this way called Ironville? - You mean used to be called Ironville. Got some strange new name now, bunch of weirdos up there. Don't let nobody around. Why do you wanna know? - Just interested, that's all. - If you've any sense, you'll stay interested from a distance. - Now I'm really interested. - When I give advice, I expect people to listen. - Now my interest is really peeked. - Guess I'm not makin' myself clear enough. (yelling) That's just a way of saying please. (yelling) - That's just a way of saying thanks but no thanks. (tense music) - A piece of cake. (whistling) (tense music) (yelling) (yelling and grunting) (yelling) (yelling and grunting) (yelling) (yelling and grunting) (slow orchestral music) - Oh! - Look who's on pins and needles now (laughing). - My elite ground corps pulverized. - Look at it this way popsicle, you're getting closer to seeing the Optimus destroy Steve Chase. That is if you can overcome Operation Sky Dive. - I know, I know, and don't call me popsicle. - Popsicle, popsicle, popsicle. - I said don't call me popsicle. (bird crowing) (gentle bell music) - Never let yourself forget the soul of karate. Character, effort, sincerity, etiquette, self-control. Maintain concentration at all times, looking deep into your own being. (yelling) As the master said, to become a victor, one must first be victorious over oneself. (dramatic music) - Question, why are eagles wearing umbrellas? - It's amazing the lengths Marduk's willing to go to to keep outsiders away from his experiment. - At least we know we're getting close. - I will see you, and raise one. - I'll see you and raise five. - I'm beginning to ask myself why I came along on this joyride. - Why did you come along, loyalty to Steve? - You kiddin'? I'll do anything for bucks. - Yeah but somehow you always seem to end up on the side of the good guys. - Works out that way. - I'll raise you one again. - Five more again. - A beautiful site, but deadly. Okay guys, here we go. (bold, adventurous music) - Come on I've raised you five. (bold, adventurous music) (tense music) (yelling) - Okay. I'll go five more again. - Five more on top of that. (yelling) - I'll raise you another two. (yelling and grunting) - I'll see you and owe the kitty 20. (yelling) - Ah, all right, I'll see you and I'll owe one just for the hell of it. (yelling and grunting) - 20 more. - Ah what the hell, I'll owe one more. (yelling and grunting) - Another 20. - Your 20, plus one. (yelling) - 50 more. - 50 and I'll raise you two. (yelling) - You ruined my cards, damn (muffled by fighting). (yelling and grunting) Where are my cards? - [Marduk] Well? - Well, the jump was successful. - But the fight, how did we fare? - Don't worry angel face, we'll tie 'em up in knots. (men talking) - Thanks for the help. - There were only 20 of them, I didn't figure you needed help. - Well at least we know in which direction the town is situated. I watched the plane after it made the drop. - I never finished biddin'. Guess we're gonna replay the hand. - Yeah, what did you have? - A pair of threes. - A pair of threes, is that all? - Yeah, what did you have? - A royal flush, the first one in my whole life, without cheating. - Damn place gives me the creeps. It's enough to put you off potatoes forever. - It's too quiet to suit me. - The animal trap lies quietly before it springs. - What do we do now? - [Steve] We have to get inside the town before they realize it. Marduk must know we're here. We have an advantage, he doesn't know our plans. - Neither do I. - The first objective is to get the doctor out. Then we're going after Marduk. We must destroy every copy of the formula and dispose of the drug. - Why do I get this feeling I'm not gonna like it down there? - Ah, maybe if ask real nice, they'll give us the doctor. - After dark we slip inside in pairs. Gorilla, you and Hotdog are going together. Gypsy Billy and The Fly will be the B team. I'm going alone. - What about me? - You wait here. - He's my father, you'll not leave me out of the action. - Someone has to stay behind and look after the vehicle. It's our only means of escape after the mission's been accomplished. And you Kandy Kane with a K have been officially elected. - Hey with all Marduk's checkpoints, how do we get around? - The guards are the only ones who can move around freely. Pick out one your size and take his place. - What then? - I'll make my way to the lab where the doctor's being held. We'll meet in the back of the building and plan the final assault from there. Good luck. (light, anxious orchestral music) - I want you to know, I don't appreciate being left behind. - I've been hired to do a job, we'll do it my way. (dramatic music) (tense music) (adventurous music) - [Guard] Who's there? (dramatic music) - [Guard] What's goin' on down there? (dramatic music) (light drumming music) - Hey, hey somebody, open up over here. (gate rattling) - [Guard] Who's there? - I've brought some new weapons for Marduk. Come on you guys, come take a look. Come on. You guys are not gonna believe this. (groaning) Told you so. (adventurous music) - [Announcer] Attention all citizens, attention. The great, the immortal Marduk desires to speak to you. - [Marduk] My people, it has been a great disappointment to me of late to learn of the lessening in general productivity. It seems we are not using our work hours to maximum advantage. The reasons for this are unclear, but I cannot believe the problem is one of discipline or a lack of enthusiasm. Therefore, I have no choice but to increase the number of work hours and decrease recreational time. This is not a punishment, but rather a remedial measure. That is all. - [Announcer] Attention all citizens, attention. The imminent launching of Operation Water Supply calls for new scheduling. Groups one through five will report for weekly reinforcement therapy one hour earlier than usual. All other groups will report one hour later than usual. Free activity periods are to be suspended until further notice. That is all. (drumming music) (tense music) - Watch what you're doin' citizen. - I'm not your citizen. - Drugs worn off, prepare a reinforcement injection. - [Citizen] No, no, you're not gonna get me with that. (whistle blowing) No, no. No. Stop, stop, you don't understand. (suspenseful music) - Back to work, citizen. (bouncy music) - [Guard] Oh what, what? (yelling and grunting) (suspenseful music) - What are you doing here, alien? - I belong to Marduk's undercover force. - Where are your documents? - I have them right here. (yelling) (yelling and grunting) (dramatic tone) (tense, adventurous music) (people chattering) - [Guard] The rest of you ding-a-lings get in line and come here. (door opening) (tense, suspenseful music) - [Steve] Ya! I thought I told you to stay with the car. - I've got every right to be here. Where's my dad? - He's been moved, we must find him. Stick with me. - Hey shut up will ya? - I can't help it if he wasn't my size. - There you go on a tear again, what are you tryin' to do get us caught? - Stop moaning. - Rip off artist. - Great, just great. I'm sure you'll make it to the top 10 on Marduk's fashion parade. You seen the others? - Not a sign. Kandy I'd better get you some clothes, and fast. Hang on. - The doctor's not in the laboratory, he's been moved. Since you couldn't find yourself a uniform, get yourself into a work group and try to discover where he is. - Gotcha Steve. (suspenseful music) (quick, whimsical music) (man yelling) - Okay Kandy, here you go, here's some clothes for you. (Kandy sighing) What's the matter, they too big for you? I'll get you another one. - No, no, no, it's just, just perfect, thank you. Thank you very much indeed, Hotdog. - Come on, Marduk's about to get his water supply operation under way. Kandy, go get these clothes on, we'll wait for you. - Documents, on the double. - Oh yeah, you. - You guys scared the hell out of me. (laughing) - The doctor's been moved, we have to find out where he is. Otherwise-- - [Guard] What's going on here? - There's more traffic here than on Times Square on a Saturday night. We found this female citizen roaming around. - What are you doing here citizen? - Obeying the wishes of the great and wise Marduk. - This citizen acts strange. - I think I should take her to see Dr. Kane for special examination. - Rubbish. The doctor doesn't get involved in such matters. - Then perhaps I better take her to the reinforcement therapy center. - You mean of course, the control medical center. - It's the same thing isn't it? - Yes I suppose you could say that. - I think she should see the doctor anyhow. There's something not quite in order. I think he should look at her. - You're not paid to think. Marduk's orders are that he's not to be disturbed. - [Kandy] The doctor has been moved. - Why has he been moved? Where to? - He's still where he was yesterday, the second floor of the control medical center. - I'm taking her there immediately, there's something wrong. - You're right alien, something is wrong. You're all coming with me. (yelling) - Let's go, let's take this citizen to her father. Where'd you come from? - Looks like you know where you're going, so I thought I would join you. - Only a gorilla would look for trouble. - [Steve] We found out where the doctor is, we're going in after him. - This area's off limits, what are you doing here? - We're taking these citizens to the doctor for special examination. - I have no orders for special examinations. Let's go see what the captain has to say about this. - I knew I shoulda stayed in bed this morning. - We'll have to do it the hard way, take them first chance you get. - Quiet, no talking. - [Man] Step on it, come on, move on. Have your sleeves rolled up. - So we meet again, alien. I thought I might find you here. - We must be losing our touch. Usually when we hit somebody they stay hit. - Well we won't have to worry about that much longer. Technician, bring six injections. (tense music) - [Marduk] Welcome to New Babylonia, Mr. Chase. - I never thought I'd be happy to see you. - Rest assured, you won't be. These aliens are not to be injected. I have far greater plans for Mr. Chase. (dramatic music) (grunting and yelling) Guards! Everybody freeze. I will not be deprived of my pleasure, Mr. Chase. (yelling) As you must know by now, these are my warriors. The elite of the elite. One day when I have fulfilled my mission, these people will replace the guards. Ordinary weapons will be obsolete. These are to be the upper class, those individuals superior in every way. Physically, intellectually, spiritually, and emotionally. - With freedom of choice eliminated. - Freedom of choice, as we have come to know it, has lead inexorably to the deterioration of the ethical and moral fabric of society. Even as we speak, the new oral serum is being readied for shipment. Discipline is the keystone to a successful society and is effective only when the people understand it is a necessity for their own survival. - And the doctor's drug ensures their understanding? - Practically speaking yes. In a very short time, the entire world will be brought under my control. - And just where do I fit in to this perfect world you're creating? - Amongst the elite there is always one who stands out above all others. The Optimus. It is an obsession with me that he be not only the best in this community, but the best of the entire world. That means he must beat you in open combat. - And if I refuse to fight? - That will be tragic. You would of course have to die. - Compelling argument. - [Marduk] Steve Chase I'd like you to meet Dr. Horacio Kane. - How do you do, Dr. Kane? Dr. Kane? You've drugged him. - Naturally. We couldn't have him inventing things that might be harmful to New Babylonia now could we Mr. Chase? - And he's another example of your happy peaceful citizens. - Of course he's happy. You may talk to Mr. Chase now Dr. Kane. Tell him how happy you are. - I am very happy. - What's going on here? - I caught blondie here taking photographs of the serum vats. I suspected for a long time that she was an alien. - It's not true, Marduk. You must record your triumph for history. - What a shame that one so beautiful can be so deceitful. You realize of course that you've lost your elite status, my dear. You must have her interrogated immediately. We don't know how much the aliens know. - Enough to cause them to blow New Babylonia right off the map I'm afraid. - You're wrong Mr. Chase, that's exactly what they'd never do. They want that drug as much as I do. - So you're Steve Chase. Hm, not bad. - Has anybody ever suggested you change your hairdresser? - Enough of this nonsense. You'll have to excuse me a moment Mr. Chase. Oh and please bear in mind, in case you get any funny ideas, these guards will be waiting right outside this door. How long were you there? - A classic case of paranoia. He won't feel safe til he's got the whole world at his feet. - [Marduk] How long have you had this camera? - I was only taking pictures. - You're not drugged. - [Marduk] Where is the camera? - No, in my case the drug wears off in two days. Marduk has no idea. - [Marduk] What were you doing in the serum vats? - I was taking pictures. - There in the serum vats with your camera, what were you taking pictures of? When were you there? - That makes my job a lot easier. - Your job? Who are you? - Your daughter hired me to help you escape. - That only presents one problem, Mr. Chase. - What's that? - My daughter is here, already one of Marduk's victims. - The puzzle's all coming together. In any case, I have to get you out of here and destroy the serum. - Maybe I can be of some help to you there. I've developed an antidote, in both liquid and tablet form. - All we have to do is get them into the hands of the people. - Into their stomachs you mean. Here, take these for your protection. - When were you there? - We haven't much time. Marduk has already poured the serum into the water supply. The antidote must be inserted into the contaminated water within 24 hours or it won't work. - I think I know how. (bold, dramatic music) - [Crowd] Marduk. Marduk. - Citizens of New Babylonia, today here we will witness that the Optimus is indeed the best. The best in the entire world. - And what if Steve Chase wins, dumpling? - He will not win. - It's no use, there's no way out of here. - There's always a way out. - Hey Gorilla, you wanna try these bars? - Huh, can't figure it out. Always works in the movies. - Well, well, fancy meeting you here. - What's going on here? - The bad news is Marduk's gonna make us get out there in the arena and fight his people. - My god, like gladiators. - And the good news? - I talked to Dr. Kane. - How is he? - Your father's just fine. - Steve that's terrific. - Sure terrific, and what do we do now? - I've got a plan. Once we're out there in the arena, stick with me. - You can count on it. - There's just one thing Miss Kane, or whoever you are. - There's no time now, I'll have to explain later. Please trust me. - You stay here, the rest come with us. (dramatic music) - Citizens, we have in our midst several strangers, who have come here to cause us great harm. We will prove today in this arena, that we are stronger than these aliens. They cannot and will not destroy us. (citizens applauding and cheering) Bring them in, let the fun begin. (dramatic music) - We meet yet again. (yelling and grunting) (groaning) (yelling and grunting) - [Crowd] Oh! (yelling) (drumming music) - This time you won't be so lucky. (yelling and grunting) - [Crowd] Oh! (yelling and grunting) (dramatic drumming) (yelling and grunting) (dramatic drumming) (yelling and grunting) Whoa. (groaning) (yelling and grunting) Whoa. - Hotdog. (dramatic drumming) (yelling and grunting) - [Crowd] Oh! Whoa. (yelling and grunting) Oh! (yelling) (yelling and grunting) Oh! (crowd chattering quietly) - They're making us look like idiots. - Don't worry, Steve Chase has not yet met the Optimus. - And what if Steve Chase wins? - Then the inevitable will happen. I'll have to kill him. Citizens, we will now bring on the leader of these aliens. The great Steve Chase, who is going to battle the Optimus. (dramatic orchestral music) (yelling and grunting) - [Crowd] Whoa! (yelling and grunting) Whoa! (yelling and grunting) Oh! (yelling and grunting) (groaning) (yelling and grunting) (yelling) Wow. (yelling) (rapid, swirling electronic music) (yelling) (crowd applauding) (yelling) - Nice going, Steve. - I knew you'd get him. - You'll not deprive me of my victory, Mr. Chase. I shall have the last laugh yet. - No, I am the Optimus, Marduk, the champion of champions. - You'll not be the Optimus until you defeat them, under my control. Guard, bring a drink for Mr. Chase. You shall have the honor of being the first person in the entire world to drink the new liquid serum. It's either that, or immediate death for all your friends. (crowd gasping and chattering) Goodbye Steve Chase, and welcome to my world, citizen. - I am at your command. - Those about you are your enemies. You shall kill them. (crowd applauding and cheering) (dramatic drumming music) (yelling) - Now tell them they're free. - (groaning) All right, all right. You are free. I am no longer your master. - From today on, New Babylonia no longer exists. - [Marduk] From today on, New Babylonia no longer exists. - I am your enemy. - No. (groaning) - I am your enemy. - [Marduk] I am your enemy. - You must destroy me. - [Marduk] You must destroy me. (crowd talking) - [Man In Audience] Hey come on, let's go. (crowd talking loudly) (yelling and grunting) - [Marduk] Please, save me. - Kandy, Gorilla. The rest, come with me. - [The Fly] Look out. (crowd talking excitedly) (rapid bell music) (tense, chaotic music) - They're going to get away. - Not today little lady. Wait here. - You must get me out of here. - I can't, he's too strong. Let go. - Let go, do you hear? I Marduk command you. - Command? I think you're through commanding anyone. (yelling) - He's right poopsie, it's time to get out of here. - You dare to dessert me? Come back, it's our only chance. (yelling and grunting) (dramatic tone) (helicopter engine whirring) (Gorilla grunting) - [Guard] Let go of the end or we'll shoot. - [Gorilla] Go on. - No don't shoot, no! No! (rapid gunfire) (fire cackling) - You most definitely should've listened to the lady, poopsie. (dramatic music) - The formula Dr. Kane or your life. - The formula shall die with me. - It's your choice. (tense drumming music) (gun firing) (Steve yelling) (suspenseful music) (Steve groaning) - [The Fly] Steve, the fighting is over, the town has been returned to the people. - Hey Steve, you okay? - Fine buddy. (laughing) - My daughter and I thank you for all you've done. - What about the serum? - Nobody's gonna get it, I destroyed all that's left of it. - Yeah but you can't get the formula out of your head. - The formula doesn't matter, I prepared plenty of antidote. - Steve. I must talk to you. - Seems like you're the only one things didn't work out for. - Okay, so you found out I'm a government agent. - I suspected it all along. Who else could afford to pay me that much money for my services? - Then why did you come? - To prevent anybody from getting the drug. - Steve, please believe me, I've had enough of working for the government. - And I'll be around to make sure you don't change your mind. - Hey you guys, looka here. Found myself a love bird. It's crazy about me. Got room for one more? - [Bird] Popsicle report, ah-ha, popsicle report, ah-ha. - You can still come with us, we can squeeze you in. - No, I better stay back and see that the vats in the lab are cleaned up. - Okay, everybody in. Hey, why doesn't somebody else drive for a change? (bird squawking) - I'll drive. - You're on. - [Bird] Hotdog report (squawking). - Oh no. (bird squawking) - [Man] Hey slow down, slow down! - [Man] Slow down, will ya! Watch that curb! (tires squealing) (car crashing) (bold, adventurous music) (MultiCom Jingle)
