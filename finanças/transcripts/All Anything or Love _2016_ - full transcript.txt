Luke moved through the jungle with the stealth of a panther. Even after months of evading his captors, the intensity of his yearning to get home had not waned. Home... Where she... the only woman he had ever loved... waited. Now, that's pretty darn good. I think this deserves a piece of chocolate. Coming. Hey, you! Hi! Chocolate's out. Must be a good day of work. Had a bit of a breakthrough. Well, Luke did escape his captors and he's on his way back to Abby. At last. Yes! But... will Abby have the courage to give up her safe world and accept his love? That is the question. - I vote for love. - You always do. Well, one of us should. Especially in the real world. No thanks. It's enough to write about it, and to give my best friend advice about what to get her boyfriend for his birthday, which... Charlie loved the Yankees tickets. Thank you very much. I knew it. There is a reason I have been coming to you for romantic advice since the third grade. Outsider's clarity of perspective. Nobody should be outside of romance, least of all you. Au contraire. See, the world needs people like me. People who can see romance with clear eyes and then recreate it for people like you. Or you could try living it. - Did that. - Once. Once was enough. Todd wasn't... we don't mention him. Sorry. - Why are you making that face? - What face? The "oh-oh" face. It's my publisher, Diana. Why aren't you answering? 'Cause she never calls me. It's always her assistant or my ex-editor. - What was his name? - We don't mention him, either. - Okay, seriously, answer. - No, this can't be good news. - How could you possibly know that? - Instinct. Answer! Hello. Hey... Went to voicemail. You are adorably frustrating sometimes. I know. My spidey-senses are tingling. Things have just been off with her ever since the b... and? This can't be good. She wants me to come in today, for a meeting about the new draft of my book. I knew that chocolate was premature. I know. Thank you very much. Well, yeah, I'm pretty sure this has to do with the whole editing fiasco. I thought we didn't talk about that. Well, I do have this impromptu meeting because there's trouble from the last book. Flames of desire. We do not talk about the title! Can you send me an e-mail of all the things you don't talk about? Come on, I'm being serious, Molly! You are one of their biggest authors. I know, but you're only as good as your last book, and, let's face it, my last book was... What are you doing? I was saving you from potential injury! I was walking down a sidewalk! Danger can come from any direction and at any moment. Yeah, like from an iced mocha and a stranger with a hero complex? Or from a skateboarder and a distracted pedestrian. - What skateboarder? - Exactly. - And you're welcome. - Yeah. Thanks. You know, for the record, I didn't see a skateboarder. I know. And I suppose, if there had been one, then your actions would have been warranted. I think the words you're looking for are "thank" and "you". Thank you. What was that? Elevator. Morning. After you. No, that's okay. After you. A gentleman always holds the door for a lady. That's okay, this lady prefers to hold her own door, so I'm good. We could go at the same time. You really can't let this go, can you? - No. - Okay. Fine. On three. One, two, three. Go! Hi, Stacey. She's waiting in her office. Great. Thank you. Okay, so I feel like I've been called into the principal's office. - Do I have detention? - Not yet. Jo, you're aware of the less-than-stellar critical reception for flames of desire. Well, sure, but, you know, as I always say, those who can, write, and those who can't blog negative comments. - It was Publisher's Weekly. - Well... - and the Gazette. - All right. And the readers. Here's the thing. There were some facts that were a little off about the firefighters... 73. But it's the editor's job to catch that. And that's why the editor is now gone. Problem solved! No. - That wasn't the only problem. - Really? Jo, I bought your first book because your voice was fresh. It was exciting and engaged. Today, you're none of those things, and it shows. - That was blunt. - I could be blunter. No, I'm good. I read the first draft of Sealed, and, frankly, you're on the same road to making the same mistakes you made in Flames. Well, but it... it's a first draft. Just as you said, we will get there. Yes, we will get it, and we're gonna get it now. Only, this time, we need to do things differently. We need to take a different approach. Sales on your last two books have been down. We cannot afford another disaster. You cannot afford another disaster. Well, that was really ominous, Diana. Good. Because we are three months away from publication, and, Jo, your next pass has to be darn near perfect. - What, "or else"? - Yes. Or else. What do you suggest? A consultant? Not just any consultant. A retired Navy SEAL. Highly-decorated. Silver star, several bronze stars. You get to learn from the source, immerse yourself in the world. Immerse myself? That's right, you're gonna do what they do, breathe the same air. Crawl in the mud. - The mud? - The mud. This is not googleland anymore, Jo. This is hands-on research. Okay, fine. So, who is this guy? Captain Colin Kelly at your service. Of course you are. Have you two already met? Not officially. Until now, Ms. Payden. Captain Kelly. "Kelly". Wait. That's right, Jo. This is my younger brother, Colin. Great! - Well, did you read it? - I did. And? We have our work cut out for us. - We? - Yes. You, me. "We". Did you do any research? I always do my research, but just so you know, the main focus is the love story. - Yeah, that's a problem, too. - I'm sorry? Why on earth would these two fall for each other? They're total opposites. Right, but deep down, see, they're very similar. Neh. Neh? Did you just "neh" my romance? Realistically, they'd break up in six months, a year tops. He's a man of action, and she's a florist who hasn't left Tulsa. Okay. They're Yin and Yang. Well, at least you didn't say they complete each other. Okay, Captain Cynical. Your job is gonna be to make sure that the SEAL parts are accurate. I will do the writing. And for the record, I am only here because Diana asked me to be. Well, we have one thing in common. Tomorrow morning. 5:30 A.M. be there. And how is this supposed to help me writing my book? If you're gonna write with any authenticity about the Navy SEALs, you need to get to know them at the most basic level. I promise... This will be quite the introduction. You're on. "Training SEALs before they're SEALs". I bet that read better in his head. You sure about this? Are you? It's a big ask. I think I can handle the Princess. Princess? I read her bio. Both her parents are professors, she grew up in the Ivory Towers of the Ivy League, probably hasn't done a hard work in her life. Princess. First thing I learned as a publisher is you never believe everything you read. I'll keep you updated. Just do me a favor. Do not kill her. I need to have this book finished. No promises. No. It's early. I seriously prefer Google research. If we're gonna work out at the crack of dawn, I figured I should wear reflective clothing. You know, safety first. Yep, there'd be no missing you. You're peppy today. Always am after my morning workout. You've already had a workout? 4:30. Every morning. Discipline is the foundation of being a SEAL. After you. This is your place? Yes. One of four I created. We prepare recruits who plan to be SEALs for BUDS. "Basic Underwater Demolition SEALs", the 24-week SEAL-training course. See? I did some research. That's good to know. You don't expect me to do this for 24 weeks, though, right? Because that's not possible. Seals accomplish the impossible for breakfast, and the improbable for lunch. Ralph, this is Jo Payden. I figured that. Jo, this is Ralph Lodell, one of my instructors. Just FYI... I am not here for the impossible, I'm just here for a little research. Research is the accumulation of facts. Your task is to understand what it means to be a SEAL. - And your task is to teach me. - I intend to. Good. Let's get you a change of clothes. No, thanks. I feel pretty cozy as-is. We have a different style. I can't wear those. There's no arch support. Plus, I pronate, so I'm gonna need something with a little more structure. We all do it. You can, too. But... but... Are these even in my size? Seven and a half. Narrow. You're not my first lady recruit. But I thought there were no female SEALs. Not yet, but we don't discriminate. We'll prep recruits for Army and Air Force, too. Now it's time for you to meet your team. I have a team? You have to change first. Boy. Learning to be part of a team is one of, if not the most important part of being a SEAL, so consider this lesson number one. Team Delta, step forward! At ease! This is Josephine Payden. Hello. This is PJ Salizar, SEAL recruit. Carlie Jonas, Army recruit. And Barry Klimpkie, SEAL recruit. He goes by "tiny". It's ironic. Yeah, I got it. Delta team! How do we greet Payden? Hooyah! Cute! "Hoo-yah" back. Tadpoles! Before you enter BUDS, you will be expected to do the following... 70 push-ups, two minutes, 60 curl-ups in two minutes, 10 pull-ups in two minutes, run four miles with your pants and boots in 28 minutes, swim 1,000 yards... In... this is not interactive. No. I know. I just think this might be a good time for me to mention that I can't swim, so. We're the Navy SEALs. "Navy" means water. You have to swim. Right. Well, I can't, so unless you want to call your sister and let her know that I won't be delivering my rewrite because I drowned... We'll find a workaround. Okay. Thanks. For now. All right, tadpoles! Follow instructor Lodell! He's gonna get this party started. Let's move! Move! You want me to run? Okay. Could you guys wait one sec? Here I come! Guys? As some of you know... behind me is a Navy SEAL obstacle course. You'll be expected to complete it in 12 minutes. Of course, none of you will. But the journey of 1,000 miles begins with the first step. This is your first step. Let's move. Move! Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go! Be decisive, Payden. I got it! I got it! You gotta be kidding me. That wall represents fear, Payden. Okay. I'm just gonna... Next time. You must conquer it to move ahead! Must you shout? I'm not shouting! This is my "get it done" voice! Now get it done! Maybe you want me to get you a cappuccino! Ralph? Americano? - What do you think? - Extra-hot? Extra-hot! Congratulations. Today's spa day. Get in the mud! Let's go! This is hard. I'm Jo, by the way. I'm focused. I can see that. I think you'll make a very good recruit. You got time to talk, you got time to walk. Team Delta, give me another mile and a half. What? No, no, no! It wasn't them, it was me. Where you go, they go, vice versa. That is not fair! Fair? No one mentioned fair. Let's make it three miles. Way to go. You heard him. Let's move! Move it! Move! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hey, everybody. Well, that's great. So my entire team treats me like a pariah, I could barely make it through one of the obstacles on the obstacle course, and I can't really feel my legs. So, you want to explain to me what any of this has to do with me learning about being a SEAL? You really need me to spell it out for you? Apparently. Teamwork. Teamwork is crucial for SEALs. The strengths of others helps each of us, and you have to trust the strength of those around you before you go into any situation. But... you're a writer, so that'd be hard for you. What's that supposed to mean? Writers are solitary. That's not true, 'cause writers have to have a full team of people around them to get their book published. And one of the reasons I am in this mess is because my ex-editor dropped the ball. So, it's the ex-editor's fault? No, I said one of the reasons. And you do realize what this means for you, don't you? It means that you are now, officially, on my team. - Team SEALed with a kiss. - Please, don't say that out loud. All right. Well, at some point, I am gonna need to get some non-cardio-induced information from you, I guess. - Fine. - Fine! - All this from one day? - You have no idea. I was so sore when I woke up this morning, I could barely move. Thank you so much for coming over here and saving me. How could I not? You sounded so sad on the phone. I am sad. Besides, Charlie was getting on my nerves. Has the bloom already fallen from that particular rose? A little wilty. When you were dating the guy we don't talk about, did he go on and on about getting enough billable hours? I mean, it's just one of the many things that I do not miss. What do you miss? Honestly, I can't think of a thing. There has to be something. You dated for nearly a year. For you, that is a record. Yeah, one I intend to never break. Jo. Molly, please, I'm in enough pain as-is. Potassium tablets. Thank you. Don't forget to take them tomorrow, too. The second day is always worse. Are you serious? Do you want me to read back the last paragraph? Yes. That would be great. If you could also do all my typing... I think all my fingers are bruised. This way I get to find out what happens next. "He crouched behind a rock, "waiting for nightfall before he made his next move. "Fear coursed through his veins, but he tamped it down. With only his flashlight to guide him he... " flashlight? What? How did you...? Why not have a klieg light, make it even easier for the enemy to spot him? Or... or, better yet, he should stand up and announce, "love has made me stupid. "Please... Take me away". Molly, Colin. Colin, Molly. Hi. Hi, Molly. Do you know what you don't do when you're behind enemy territory at night and you're trying to escape with your life? - Use a flashlight? - Bingo! Molly, you make it to the next round! You, however, do not. Where were you this morning? Lying around, groaning in pain. Why? Because you were supposed to be at bootcamp. You cannot honestly expect me to be functional after yesterday. I can, and I do. We had team activities planned. Team Delta was a woman short. - No. - Yes. - Do they hate me? - You're not their favorite. She can go tomorrow, right? Wait a minute! You said it was gonna be worse tomorrow, and I can barely walk today. You should try this. It's protein powder, amino acids, and minerals. And she's saved from tomorrow. We're under repair. But the next day... She'll be there. Whose side are you on? You'll need to flush out the toxins and stretch, and that means... - Yoga. - Yoga? Yeah, Molly teaches yoga. Vinyasa. You ever tried it? Yeah. Right. - You're not scared, are you? - Afraid of yoga? Raise your right foot into your left thigh... Hands into prayer. Deep breath in... And exhale. And release. Take hold of the inner-arch of your right foot. Breathe in, raise your left arm, and, as you exhale, lean forward... Kick your foot back, reach your heart to the sky. - How long do I have to hold this? - Two minutes. I'm never gonna need this in the real world. Come on! Namaste. I feel so much better. Thank you. That was fun. I don't think he shares the same sentiment. Yeah. That's what makes it fun. Glad I could help you feel better. Bye, Colin! Bye. So, what did you think of yoga? Well, actually, I prefer my exercise to be a bit more active. Well, you seemed pretty active every time you tipped over. Colin. Hey, Colin, wait. Do you have lunch plans? Why? You got some wheatgrass and granola you want me to try? No, but I do have some questions about the SEALs that I'd love to ask you, if you're up for a little writer-pestering. Okay. But on one condition. So much better than yoga. So you were telling me about the mission. Right. Before a SEAL goes on any mission, we prepare. And then we prepare some more, and then we prepare again, until, when we go wherever it is we're going, we already know so much about what we're going to do, it seems old hat. But mistakes happen? All the time. Like with your Luke. Great! So what I wrote is possible? Yes and no. Absolutely, the helo could've crashed, but where you went wrong is having Luke's team leave without searching for him. When you bond with someone, you never leave them behind. Okay. I can fix that. Short-term. But it's just, like, Luke's character is so solitary by nature, you know? You can bond with your SEAL brothers and still be solitary. Would that describe you? I thought we were talking about the characters in your book. Characters are just amalgamations of other people's stories, and every little bit helps, so... Okay. I... I wouldn't consider myself solitary as much as... I'm always on the move. By yourself. Yes. You know, I read somewhere that some SEALs have trouble adjusting to civilian life. I guess that's true. But I've been retired now for a few years, and I'm good. But, you know, you never stop moving. Old habits. Actually, I'm heading out in a couple months to open up a new bootcamp in Auckland, New Zealand. My first international venture. Congrats. Was Mars not available? Yeah, it's far. But I am, not tied down, so why not? Yeah, sure. I mean, makes sense. You'd actually have to physically be in one place long enough to get tied down. - Are you gonna finish the pizza? - No. - It's for Ralph. - Okay. Thank you. Remember, we're closed Monday, but Tuesday A.M., where will you be? Bootcamp, sir! Bright and early. Hooyah! Okay. He says that so much. Well, if the goal is to make every part of my body hurt? Progressing nicely. I meant with the rewrite. I know. Yeah, it is. Actually, I'm learning a lot. Good! Because I am throwing a prelaunch party for the book. Really? So soon? Well, we have to do something to show that we're behind this, behind you. All the critics who didn't like Flames will be there, so it's a sign of confidence. - When? - A couple of weeks. The earlier before the release, the better. Shows confidence, and it creates buzz. - So you're bluffing? - Only partially. I am confident in your talent, Jo. Nobody can write romance like you can, when you want to, but it's just that, over these last couple of books, it's like you've stopped believing in it. Of course, I believe in romance! Come on! It's me! Hearts, flowers... You know, like... Blah, blah, blah. "Blah, blah, blah". When was the last time you seriously dated someone? Like, a couple years ago. Okay. Didn't you bring him to a book-signing? "Todd"? Yeah, but I don't really talk about him. Maybe you should. Is this turning into a therapy session, Diana? No. It's just that you would not be the first author to get hurt and then hide behind their writing. Jo, you're smart, you're creative, and you're attractive, and it would be a real shame if you did that. A shame for me, or a shame for my writing? Both. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll make you a deal. How about, first, I focus on becoming a Navy SEAL... thanks for that, by the way... second, I finish my novel, and then... I work on my own personal romance? How's that? Deal. Great. Bye. Okay. Hey, guys... Listen, um... I'm really sorry about the other day. I promise... it's not gonna happen again. You gotta understand. This is important to us. We're not just doing this for book research. This is our life. I get it. I'm sorry. I promise I'll respect your time in the future. But, for now... How about just a little token? Flower. That's for you. Orange... to bring out the colors in your cheeks. Happy spring! You know? So... yeah! Go, team, right? Cool. Knock-knock! - Good morning! - Morning. What is that? You may recognize these. They are called "flowers". This really isn't the place for flowers. Why are they here? To brighten the place up! You know, when things get tough, remind people that spring has sprung. Those are pretty! Gerbera daisies are Lucy's favorite. What? Who's Lucy? My wife. 20 years. This... Saturday's our anniversary. You wouldn't happen to have the flor... - Thanks, Jo. - You're welcome. Boy. And... You are welcome. The purpose of log pt... or "physical training" for the newbie... is to build team cohesion. You're only as good as your weakest member, so you want to make sure you have the right people by your side. Keep it up! Okay, Tiny, can you just maybe lower your arms a little bit? The angle's really tough from back here. If I do, I can't lock my elbows. We just need to outlast team Alpha, guys. I don't know how much longer I can hold on. No, no, we can do this! We can do this. Tiny, just slow your breathing a little. How else am I supposed to breathe? Try yoga breathing. Did she just say "Yoda breathing"? Yoga. With a "g". You know, it's good for when you're stressed out. - You mean, like lamaze? - Sorta. My sister has four kids. She says breathing helps with the pain. I'll do anything. I'm in! Good. Take a deep breath, in through the nose... ...and out through the mouth. Again! Deep breath. In through the nose... Out through the mouth... Very good! In through your nose... ...and out through your mouth. She's got team Delta doing yoga breathing. You know yoga breathing? Yeah. Kinda sorta. Kundalini or Bikram? Vin-something. Vinyasa. Yeah. That stuff... No resting the log on your heads! ...really helped my shoulder. See? How long have you been doing it? A few years now. Lucy got me into it when my blood pressure got... No slacking! ...too high. Worked like a charm. How come you never mentioned it before? Thought you'd laugh. You're right. All right, team Alpha is out! Which means, team Delta, you win! As your reward... You get to put the log down. Thank you. Alpha, Delta, don't get too comfortable. We're going through the mud. - Yeah! - Team! Teams are good. Nice job. She's cute. Who's she? Annalise. We've been friends since we were kids. Want to ask her out, but... But...? She's just way outta my league. PJ, are you kidding me? I'm s... I have watched you scale a 13-foot wall like you were walking up a stepladder. I watched you crawl through a pit that was covered in barbed wire like it was nothing. I cannot believe you're afraid to ask out some girl. I mean... Love's scary. Okay, I have an idea. How about we come up with a plan? We will call it... "Ask out Annalise". It'll be good. Okay, you got a deal. Okay, great. Hey. Hey! I meant to give you these earlier. What's that? My notes. No, Colin, this chapter is all about Abby. Yeah. She's problematic. I'm sorry? She's way too much of a dreamer in comparison to Luke, who, let's face it, is way too much of a realist for her. I mean, she hasn't even flown internationally. It's 2017. Why doesn't fly internationally? I mean, even to Canada. I haven't. What? What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything. There just hasn't been any need for me to go. Everything that I could ever desire is right here, in the tri-state area. How do you know that? That's why people go on adventures, to find things they never knew were out there. I'll tell you what. I think it would be best if you just stuck to your area of expertise. International travel is my area of expertise. Well, writing romance novels is mine, so. Okay, Colin, you know what? If I need your advice, I'm gonna ask for it. Okay? Why do I doubt that? "We should go out sometime". It's a little general. You don't want it to go into the friend-zone. I would ask her out to something really specific. Like what? Like, what kind of stuff does she like? She works for an airline, so she's gone a lot. She mentioned that she'd like to do a staycation and see stuff she never gets to see. What about, like, the twilight ferry cruise? And then she can get a view of the city, and it doesn't break the bank. I like that! And, sometimes, it gets a little cold on the boat, so you might just have to snuggle. I really like that! Up top, Payden! Okay. I got this. Next time. Okay. We need to talk about your wardrobe. What's wrong with my style? You have so much to learn, my little padawan. Really? Think they were talking fashion. I think so. So? I've always thought you were talented. But...? But your details are much stronger now. And Luke's struggle with being alone versus loving Abby is believable. But...? I mean, I'm just sensing that there's, like, another "but" in there, kind of lurking. - I want more romance! - I knew it! I have lost my romance mojo! - That's ridiculous. - No! It's not! Diana says she thinks I'm so burned out by love. That it's now affecting my work. I... Can we talk about it now? Yes. Yes. I've got to figure this out. As your friend, it's been hard to watch. Especially for a guy who wasn't worth it. You guys never laughed together. Well, yeah, 'cause he's not funny. He's so not funny. I guess I just want so badly to have what my parents have. You know? Do you know what my dad did for my mom, for her birthday last week? No, but I'm sure it set the bar incredibly high... Get this. Hot-air balloon ride. A picnic. All at sunset. I mean, so romantic. Do you know they still write each other love notes after 30-plus years? See? This tells me you are the same romantic you have always been. You just hold your parents at such a high standard, that no one can live up to that. Maybe. Maybe. No "maybe". You know I'm right. It's your humility that I've always found so endearing. Okay, back to you. It's been two years since Todd. - I know! - It's enough. You have to give it another try. Is there anyone on the horizon? How about Captain Hottie? Please. And I mean, come... don't be delusional! Not an outright rejection. I'm sorry, I believe "delusional" constitutes a rejection. Too bad. Because his name is the first in years that has made you light up. There you go. Thank you. I'll take one of those. Thank you. I'm fine. Thank you. Camo pants, huh? Yes. I thought the military theme would put people in the mood. No, it's a nice touch. Thank you. Lowell Bingley. Isn't he the critic from the "Manhattan monitor"... - ... who said... - ... Called Flames... ..."blazingly inept"? Lowell! So good of you to come. You've certainly gone all out. Yes. Nothing, but the best. Speaking of, have you met the lady of the moment? Josephine Payden. Hello. I wasn't sure you'd be here. Well... I am. We are all so excited about SEALed with a kiss. I gather, from the title, and from the way the wait staff is dressed, that this latest love Tome is military-themed? Yes. It is. Is that a problem? My son is in the Navy. I don't really care to see such an important institution reduced in such a trivial arena. The romance genre is the biggest-selling in all of fiction. I mean, it's worth billions. Not to mention, we might have an opportunity to reach tons of people who might not ever know what Navy SEALs do. I mean, that's hardly trivial. No one is disputing the reach. It's the message that worries me. You have my word that no other publishing house or author will ever be more diligent about making sure that Navy SEALs are portrayed accurately and with the utmost respect. Fair enough. But I will be reading carefully, and any more mistakes... There'll be no mistakes. ...or superficial coverage, and, I will call you out. Again. Fair enough. Diana. Yes. Lowell. Nicely done. Now, only a dozen or so more to go. I just saw Margo Marcoux. She was absolutely vicious about Flames. Listen to me. Do not talk to her until I warm her up with a chocolate eclair. No problem. Hi. Hello. There she is... The Princess who won't fly internationally and can't swim. You know, it's a real testament to how much I don't want to be here that your company is preferable to theirs. Plus, I am hardly a Princess. Right now, you could give Kate Middleton a run for her money. It's so odd hearing "Kate Middleton" come out of your mouth. Well, I had an ex that was a Royal-Watcher. Yeah, and, yes, our lack of compatibility was a big factor in the break-up. I bet! How long ago was that? Long enough for her to get married and have kids. You miss her? I'm happy for her. She got exactly what she wanted, to settle down. Is that what you want? I was on active duty. It wasn't an option. But, I mean, you're retired now, so it is... Isn't it? Do you two not spend enough time together? Not with me all gussied up and her dazzled by my beauty. Yes, you do look pretty. And speaking of which, we are gonna shoot the cover next week, so I will send you all the details, if you would like to join me here at my house. Yes, absolutely. - Yeah? - Yeah. Please tell me you at least got a guy who looks like he is military and not just been going to the gym. Before we get into that always-fun topic, I do want to make sure that my author is not hiding from the very people she's here to win over. Yeah. Excuse us. Good luck, Princess. Absolutely. Yes. So true. I'm sure it will be fine. Once again, I want to thank you all for coming here today. I believe that we have a special book from a special author, and it happens to be in an arena that is very dear to my heart. You might not know this, but my brother, Colin, is a highly-decorated Navy SEAL, and... He has been a consultant on this book. I also want you to know that Josephine Payden has been so dedicated to making sure that her story reflects the truth of SEAL life, that she has been training for weeks with actual recruits. So, please... Let's take a moment and thank our very brave men and women of the U.S. military. Thank you. And I cannot wait for you all to read SEALed with a kiss! Thank you so much! You weren't supposed to do that. And I hope you enjoy the book. Leaving so soon? I just spent hours playing nice with my harshest critics. I deserve a medal. Yeah, you did go above and beyond. Were you watching? Maybe. And, uh... About earlier, when I gave you notes on Abby, I might have been... You know... wrong. I'm so sorry. What was that? I was wrong. That's what I thought you said. Bye. What's going on with you and Jo? We're just working together, like you asked. So, I'm just imagining the flirtation between the two of you? Absolutely. It's just an interaction between colleagues. I'm gonna hold you to that, because I cannot have one of my biggest authors distracted at this critical time. - Am I clear? - Yes, ma'am. That's not funny, Colin, I'm serious. She needs to focus on that rewrite. Besides, you're leaving town. You're going to place that doesn't exactly encourage long-distance relationships. Down-shift, sis. Jo and I are not in a relationship. Good. Because she has a lot riding on getting this book right. We all do. Gorgeous. You look fabulous. You're gorgeous. Beautiful! It's gonna look good. I think so. It's just the hair. - That one side looks... - Yeah. Wait. You're here. Well, I had to check out what version of Fabio you guys came up with. Yeah. Ridiculous. He's not even wearing the right uniform! That's for the marines, not Navy! My gosh. He's right. - How did we not see this? - Well, they're very similar. Not to the trained eye. Excuse me! Do we have a Navy uniform? That's all that I got. Does it matter? Yes! All right, we're gonna take a break. This is a disaster. How am I going to find a Navy uniform? Well, I have one in my car, but it's never gonna fit that guy. You could wear it. Of course, I could wear it, it's mine. No... I'm saying... You could wear it. No, no, no, no, no. It's not gonna happen. That's a great idea. It's a terrible idea, D. You say yourself, that these big book-cover models, they don't look like real military. Well, you are real military. Reschedule. We don't have enough time. Stock footage. It's just gonna end up being some version of this guy... who, you're right, doesn't capture the essence of a Navy SEAL. But you do. She's right. No. Please? No. All right, all right, stop. It's okay... You kidding me? No. Not the lips. Now... Look at me. Chin down. He's just not comfortable. Yeah, I know, but it's just his first time doing one of these things. Which is irrelevant to the finished product. He's so handsome. It'll work. Handsome? Yeah, you know, objectively. Speaking as an outside observer. You know, it's really more of a compliment to your gene pool, so congrats to your mom. Not that you're handsome. It's just that, um... Jo, listen. Now, when I spoke to you earlier, about dating, what I was actually meaning... - ... was after the book is done. - Right. Just because you don't want to be distracted... what's she doing to him? What are you doing? Unbuttoning your jacket so we can see your chest. For what? So that it looks... no, we're not doing that. Absolutely not. Thank you. Thank you. I got it. Thanks so much. Sure. You're doing a great job. No problem. I'll just go. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Here. Thank you. Okay. Think we're... You can keep going. Okay. So, that was... Awful. A learning experience? The photographer is really happy. She is? Yeah, she said she got some great shots. I can't see how. Well, you can do a lot these days with filters, processing. I saw this little place up the road, if you want to go, grab a bite. You know, just... Talk SEALs? Hooyah. Great. I'm just gonna grab my stuff. I'll meet you out front? Okay. I'll drive. We'll take two cars. Thank you. So why did you want to be a Navy SEAL? - I wanted to protect people. - From what? When I was 10 years old, my parents passed. I'm sorry. Diana had just graduated from college, so you can imagine the idea of raising her little brother wasn't exactly what she envisioned for her life. But she did it. That's why you two are so close. I owe everything to her. And I wasn't the easiest kid to raise. I got into some trouble when I was a teenager. 'Kay, it wasn't anything serious, but it was enough for d to suggest the high school's R.O.T.C., for some discipline. Right. And was it love at first sight? Hardly. But... when it got there, it stuck. Especially when I realized I could save people. So, you know, what now? - Now? - Well, yeah. You're retired. What does superman do once he's hung up his cape? He starts schools for other would-be superheroes, of course. No, seriously. It's something I had planned. Get into the SEALs, retire, and then start bootcamps. That's great. So, do any... ...missions really pop in your mind? Like, when you think back? Kenya. 2008. Six missionaries were captured by pirates. They were held at sea, so they called us in to extract them. James, who was one of the people rescued, he had a wife who was nine months pregnant, and seeing them reunited was the most amazing feeling. I bet. And that's when you earned your silver star, right? - Look at you, you did do research. - I told you, I always do research. But seriously, a silver star is a big deal. You should be very proud. I think medals are for trackmeets, but it is important to recognize the sacrifices that the Navy SEALs make. Yeah. I bet Diana was super-proud. Oh, she was. You two are really sweet. Makes me kinda wish I had a sibling. I mean, Molly is sort of like a sister to me, but it's, like, every time she starts dating a new guy, she sort of disappears. Is that what you're like when you date? Disappear? No. No. But Molly says that's because I'm never really into the guy. Never? Well... There was this one guy. Todd. We dated for, like, a year. Until? Until... I found out that I was not the only person he was dating at the time. I'm sorry. Were you hurt badly? I thought I was. But, actually, I think I was just using him to hide behind, you know, kind of like a shield. It's just... I want fireworks. Like I write about. And I want that, and I don't think that I should have to compromise. No. You shouldn't have to. Thank you. And there's... One other thing that I don't think you should have to compromise on. What's that? Saturday afternoon, at 3:00... I would like it if you would meet me at the community pool. Oh, no... Oh, yes. No. I can't. Okay, Jo. I posed in front of strangers with makeup on. Yeah. You can do this. I don't suppose the first lesson could be more of, like, a visualization-type thing? Well, that's excellent mental tool, one I use myself, but you're gonna have to get in the water. Well, at least, you know, turn around. Close your eyes. Okay, just... ...take my hand, I'll guide you into the water. You know, I just want to point out that this should show you how dedicated I am to getting the details accurate in the story. I can see that. Well, not literally, because my eyes are closed, but you've gone above and beyond. Thank you. Now, Jo? Take my hand. Jo. Okay. That's it. Cold! One step at a time. Good. All right, can I open my eyes? You're in the water. Okay! That's enough for the first lesson. No. No. Are you scared? No, just, you know, a little apprehensive, when you try something new. It's like that for most people, the first time they try anything. Of course, you could always just not try things. Well, then you'd be avoiding life, and you don't want to avoid your life, now, do you, Jo? Only the scary parts. So I don't suppose the pools are this warm when you do all your SEAL training? No. Not even close. We'd have to tread water for hours, in a circle, passing weights to each other. It's to build stamina. I think I'll skip that lesson. So how come you never learned how to swim? Have you heard of the term "absent-minded professor"? Well, I had two of those for parents. And don't get me wrong, they're great, they're great. But sometimes they'd get so caught up in academia, that they'd forget to teach me sort of basic parenting things. - Like swimming? - Yeah, like swimming. But it's okay, it's why I became a writer. They would be so involved with their math problems, that I would just throw myself into books, and I would create whole new worlds in my mind, and then, eventually, I put it in my novels. And you made me tell that story to distract me, to get me into the deep end? - Didn't you? - Yeah. And it worked. It sure did. Okay... You all right? Yeah, I feel... You know, wet, but fine. Okay. What's next? - Floating. - Floating? You can do this. Do you trust me? - Don't let go. - I won't let go. - Don't let go. - I won't. I want you to lean back. Okay. Breathe nice and easy. Okay, don't... don't let go. I won't, I won't. When you're ready, you let go. Okay. All right. Good! Good, good, good, good. Okay. I got you. Just relax. Nice and easy. Breathing, breathing, and... You're doing it! Great job! That's fantastic. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, I got you. You're safe. I think maybe that's enough for one day. I got you. - You got me? - I got you. How did you not kiss him in that moment? I don't know! I just... I got flustered, 'Kay, Molly? Yeah. Because you like him. Fine. All right? I like him. But it really doesn't matter, because Colin's gonna be gone in a month, and, plus, he's my boss's brother. So what are you gonna do? The only thing I can do... throw myself into work and ignore the whole thing. Yeah, that's healthy. Look, it's all gonna be over in a month. My book's gonna be published. Colin gonna's be in New Zealand, and I'm just gonna be here. Like I always am. Unless you go to New Zealand. Your laptop is portable. You can write from anywhere. I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't even kissed yet. "Yet"? I'm gonna go work on the Luke and Abby reunion. I bet they kiss. I'm over you. It's so close. All the details are accurate. I had Colin check. Yes, I know. I can see that. It's just... When we start to go deep, about how Luke and Abby feel, we just fall short of what could be amazing. I mean, these two, they can't be together, so it should feel like torture. They should be together. What? What? Are you okay? You're not... You know, distracted by anything? Or anyone? What? No! Yes. No. I'm good. I'm great! Pain, love, torture. I got it. It's already written. You're welcome. Good. Thanks. Colin? Alexis! Hi! What brings you here? My sister's office is next door. I thought I'd be spontaneous and visit her. And friend. So when they say "permanent marker", they aren't kidding! We had to get Doug a whole new briefcase. Man. Cute kids, though. You know, your name came up in conversation the other day. Do I want to know? It's all good. I was just recounting your love of the royal family. That's right. - I made you watch the wedding. - Yes, you did. I'm surprised you didn't break up with me right away. I wanted to. I believe you used the "I'm being sent to Istanbul" excuse. I was sent to Istanbul. Well, you were always going off somewhere else. So! Where's your next big adventure? New Zealand. Are you going alone? Why? It's just... You're such a catch, Colin. I don't know about that. Is there someone? I'm not sure. Was this the "friend" that you were being spontaneous for? - Interesting. - Why? - You were never spontaneous. - I was spontaneous! You planned everything to the last detail, and you never deviated, when we dated. It's what made you a great SEAL, but a terrible boyfriend. I never thought about that. It doesn't matter. I'm gone in a few weeks, and I've never been a stay-in-one-place kinda guy. First of all, love always matters. And secondly, settling down doesn't have to be a place. It can be a person. Doug and I and the kids, I mean, we travel all the time, and I know that, wherever they are, that's my home. Thanks. Remember, to get into BUDS, you must complete this course in 12 minutes! Ready! Set! Go! Guys! Come on, Payden! You can do this! Seriously, I can't. If you had let me keep that attitude, I wouldn't be going on a date with Annalise this Saturday! What? She said yes? That's awesome! - I know! - Focus, Payden. It's too high. Go back a couple yards. Come on. Come on! You can do this. Get your foot over! Put your left foot down. Now the other foot down. Look down here. All right, now fall in my arms. Ready? - Well done! - Okay! Let's go, let's go! That is... Without a doubt, the worst recorded time in SEAL obstacle history. But you did it as a team. Congratulations. Congratulations! Guys, there we go. Bring it in, bring it in. Team Delta! Hooyah! Hooyah. Congrats on finally getting over the high wall. Thanks. I read the new pages with the Luke and Abby reunion, and I... were the SEAL parts accurate? They were. Great. Jo! Hang on. Is everything okay? Yeah. Fine. I'm just really busy. Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. This will be my last bootcamp. There are no more SEAL parts to my book, and I really need to buckle down and meet my deadline. Just like that? We both knew this was temporary. Right. Well... Let's at least go out to celebrate. You've put in a lot of hard work. I've got something planned already with the team. I don't want to bother you. You've already gone above and beyond. And this way, you have time to get ready for your next great adventure. I'm sure I'll see you, maybe once before you go. Sure. The boys are ready. - Yeah. - Let's go. Don't you look cheery. Hey. Having second thoughts about leaving? Well, the new bootcamp has to be opened, and the investors won't be happy if I skipped it. Okay. That doesn't answer my question, which, you know, answers my question. And also raises another... What does this have to do with Jo? What makes you think... don't. You've been my responsibility since you were 10. I know every expression in your repertoire. You cannot surprise me. I think I'm in love with her. Until now. I've never heard you say those words before. Are you sure? No! No. But... I can't stop thinking about her. It's like there's this Jo Payden loop playing in my head. Part of me wants to turn it off, but another part of me wants to... Let it play on forever. The craziest part is, we haven't even... Haven't even kissed. Really? Yeah. Nothing makes sense, but, from the first moment, my heart beat faster. When she's not there, I look for her, and when she is there, I have to stop myself from staring. You sound like a romance novel. I know. Well, have you told her any of this? I don't know where to begin. You get in your car, you drive to her place, you knock on the door. When she answers, you say, "Jo... "I have feelings for you, "but I'm leaving. So what exactly are your thoughts on this subject?" That sounds academic, D. Well, then, you use your own words, but you do it. I'm older than mom and dad were when they passed. You're almost there. Life is so short, Colin. If you're in love with her, or even if you think you might be, you have to tell her. What about your rewrite? You're more important than the rewrite. But if you could maybe not get her so upset that she can't finish it... Get going. "He appeared as if out of a dream, raising more questions than he answered... " Hi. Colin, hey. What are you doing here? - You mind if I come in? - S... sure. Thanks. This feels like the first time I went through "drown-proof" training in BUDS. That's where they tie your arms and your legs together, right? - Yeah. - And you... And you jump in the pool. Yeah, glad we didn't get to that exercise. Look, Jo, um... The thing is... Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. It's just, I wanted to tell you something before I leave. Colin, let me... let me start. I just want to say that I am so glad that Diana paired us up together. So am I. And if you had told me on day one, when I spilled coffee all over you, after you "saved me" from a skateboarder that may or may not have existed... he existed. ...that you and I would have ended up, ahem, friends... I wouldn't have believed it. "Friends". And I'm so grateful to you, you know. And not just for your help with the book, but for bootcamp. That is an experience I will never forget. I mean, I was part of a team. Me! And I accomplished more than I ever even thought possible, so... thank you. I'm glad it helped. It did. Immensely. Your turn. Right. I wanted to give you a memento. Thank you. I love it. Good. I'm gonna let you get back to whatever it was you were doing. Cool. Goodbye, Jo. "Holding back tears, he smiled at her "as the memories of all they had endured "faded away. She was in his arms now". "That was all he needed. "And he knew, "after a lifelong, restless journey, he was, at long last, home". That is my favorite part! Where they finally get together after everything they've been through. Well, blame my publisher... pain, torture, love. Yes! And look, it worked. Good. What is that? A surprise. It was the best photo. But my book covers usually just feature the man. Yeah, well, I felt we'd make a little exception. Has Colin seen it? No, he's not. He's been very busy, getting ready for New Zealand. Yeah. He must be really excited. No, it's work, it's not a vacation. And if he didn't have to go, I know for a fact that he would stay right here. Why do you say that? Is something wrong? Not at all! But, you know, you could phone him yourself and find out. Well, I'm a smidge busy with my little writing hobby. You want to know what the best part about this book is, it's real. I think it's probably the best thing you've ever written. Really? Yes. Well, thanks to you. And to Colin. May 13th. Yes, what about it? That's the inaugural book-signing for "SEALed". So soon? It's buzz! We sent out some advance copies to choice critics, including lowell Bingley... And? And I think you just might be his new favorite writer. How about that? How about that! I love this part. It's so cute. I bet I could recite all the dialogue. Word for word? Probably. Why didn't you say something to Colin? When he came by, you should've asked him who that woman was or something. What's the point? We are not dating. I didn't have the right to be mad at him for seeing someone else. That doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. You liked him more than I've seen you like anyone. Even Todd. I think I more than liked him. Honey. PJ's right. Love is scary. I don't know, I just feel like I waited so long to find somebody who makes me feel... Who makes me feel. You should say that to him. No, I can't. Why not? Because what if he laughs at me, or, worse, what if he pities me? I mean... Every person who has ever fallen in love has felt that exact same way at least once, including your perfect parents. I've had mine stomped on, crushed... But at least I tried. I mean, I tried. A little. Not enough. I'm such a coward. Sweetie. No. There you go. Thanks. Hi. Hey! Hi. You're here. I wouldn't miss the book launch of my favorite author. - Look. - What's going on here? Did you see the acknowledgements? Yeah, D showed me. That's very nice. Thank you. So when do you leave? I fly out in a few hours. But I changed my ticket so I could be here, and give you this. Do you want me to sign it? No. I actually wrote something for you inside, but don't read it now, please. It's... what I couldn't say to you the other night. So you did come over, planning to say something? But I choked. Like a new recruit. But it's in here. Anyway, um... Congratulations. This is great. Thank you. Have a... have a great trip. Thank you. Goodbye, Jo. Bye. See you, sis. Bye, Molly. Hi! How are you? - Hey. - Hey. Good to see you. You too. - Enjoy. - Okay. I'm sorry. Who do I make it out to, again? Thank you. Hi! I'm Alexis. I'm an old friend of Colin's and I'm a huge fan. Alexis? Yeah, when we ran into each other a few weeks ago, Colin said that you two were working together and I nearly died! I loved "Dangerous in Blue". Thank you so much. That's so nice of you to say. So, you and Colin are... Are dating now? What? No, no. I've been married for years. Colin and I did date for, like, a microsecond, back when I made him watch the royal wedding. Kate Middleton. I love her! I thought you two were dating. Maybe? Why? Well, it was the way he was talking about you, like his tone. Even when it was just about how he helped consult on this. He clearly thinks the world of you. It was really sweet and romantic, you know? What am I talking about? Of course, you know! This is the stuff you write about all the time! There you go. Thank you so much. You're so awesome. I'm sorry, just give me one... One second. I think I need a minute. Are you okay? I don't know. "Jo. "I'm no writer, so please be kind. "I've been on missions around the world, "but I've never been as scared as I was "when I tried to tell you how special you are to me, "and how I wish I was staying here with you, "so we could have a chance... "Instead of leaving. "And I realize that 'home' isn't a location. "It's a person. "And, for me, you're that person. Love, Colin". You're not gonna fight for him? Fight...? What do you... What do you mean, fight for him? What kind of romance writer are you, Payden? This is exactly when the heroine goes after her true love. It's in almost every book. What? I love romance. She's right. I mean, you wouldn't let me get away with that about Annalise. Well... Okay, no. But it's different, because... - okay, here's... - do the Yoda breathing. Thank you, Tiny. You said you wished you'd tried. Now you have a small window for a second chance. Try. It's totally worth it. You can do it, Payden! Climb the wall. They have a point. I have been trying to stay neutral through all of this, because I am your boss and I am Colin's sister, but the book is done now, and I just watched my brother walk out of here, looking forlorn when he should be happy, so I'm gonna be blunt. Do you want to be with Colin or not? Yeah, I do. Then what are you still doing here? I don't know. Blue Diamond Air. Flight 725, departs at 9:30. So you'd be okay with me just leaving here? There's a big part of me that is not happy you two did not sort this out sooner so that I'm not stuck in this situation, but there's bigger part that wants you to just to go and get him already. And you're good with me dating your brother? I am now that the book's published, yes. And I also have a feeling the next one is gonna be even better. Thanks, Diana. Go make Colin happy, and I will sort out this mess. One-way ticket to Auckland on flight 725... Is booked. My gosh. I have literally written this scene so many times. I never thought that I would be the one running to the airport! How does it feel? I don't have anything I need. I don't have a change of clothes. I don't have a toothbrush. - I don't have the right shoes. - What's this? It's my purse. And this? My wallet. Okay, it's my credit card. I understand where you're going with this. Thank you. Thank you. Jo, it's not the moon. You're going on an adventure. A real one. I am, aren't I? Yep. Thank you, guys. Thank you for helping me climb that wall. Love you guys. - Love you. - I'm so proud of you. Bye. Hooyah! That's still really cute, you guys. Hooyah. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, sorry. Great. Hi. Hi. Wait. What? What are you doing here? Don't you have a flight to catch? Don't you have a book-signing? Colin, I read what you wrote. I couldn't stay. You're on my team. I shouldn't have let you go. I should've made sure you were by my side. I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. When you bond with someone... You never leave them behind, and I nearly did. What about your plans? Seals know that you can plan all you want, but once the boots hit the ground, everything flies out the window. You gotta adapt to the new situation. I was heading to the airport, and all I could think about was how much I wished that you were with me. So I'm changing my plans. I couldn't leave without you. Well, my plans have kind of changed a little bit, too. I have a ticket to New Zealand. Really? Are you sure? Yeah. I'm so sure. I think it's about time that I traveled internationally. Yes. And fell in love. Let's do this! Yeah! Okay. On three... Two... One... And so, they walked away together, reunited as a team, with a shared sense of purpose, as they embarked on their greatest adventure ever... True love.
