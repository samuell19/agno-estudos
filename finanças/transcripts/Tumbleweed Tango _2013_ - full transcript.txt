Don't you get that I'm a total bachelor? She's five years older than me. Even she has a kid in high school... What do you take this Park Changsu for? Jeez. Why are you hitting my head? Who am I? Who am I? When you came into this world with a runny nose, who took you in and fed you? Who? I don't know. I got here on my own, damn it. Why'd you hit my head... Damn it! It really hurts. Changsu.

Tell him what? All I've done is slept with you a few times. Do you love me? Don't touch me, you jerk! Shit! What's that scumbag doing? Crazy jerk! How dare you touch me? Is there a guy yet who hit woman? That's it. Go ahead and get revenge. Who's this scumbag? Hey, look here. Aren't you going overboard? She's a woman. Mind your own business. You're not such a nice guy, are you? By the looks of your outfit, you must be some kind of crook. Do crooks beat up a woman these days? Huh? Don't get into trouble away from home. Help her up and get out of here. Huh? So what if you stare at me. This little scumbag... Ah! We can't let both of us die. You should rest at home. How dare you hit me when my guard is down! That scumbag got away, did he? This is so embarrassing. I've been had by some loser who isn't even a real gangster. Hold on. Doesn't this belong to you? Lady, this is worth $1,000! My neck freaking hurts, and this is embarrassing. Whatever! I'm leaving this here. I'm not going to be responsible for this. I didn't take it, okay? Where am I, anyway? Here you go. Please get some water.Oh, yes. Here you are. That little sucker is such a wimp. Who are you? Pardon? Who the heck are you? I've been... Go away. What? I said go away. I think you've drunk too much. How much? How much is the bill? 32 bucks. - I'll pay you tomorrow. - Huh? - I'll pay tomorrow. - Okay then. Jeez. She's gone. Who? The girl sitting here. Yeah, she left. She left her lighter. Did she leave right after I did? She left with the guys at the other table. What? How could you let her leave with losers like them? Don't you know how dangerous it is here? She didn't come here. Not here? Fine. So you did it? Why'd you bring her to your home, not a motel? Girls never put out the day they break up. Who are you? You piece of dust. Shut up and clean the place. So you did it? Wow. What? So you've finally become a real man? The real thing is so much better, isn't it? Park Changsu, you've finally done it? Oh, I don't know. It's just... Well, it was just... No, they never do it on the day they broke up. Hey, Miss Jang,Come here. Oh, hi there. Let me tell you something funny. Hey, you jerk. Stop it. Let me tell you a joke that goes like this... Hello, boss. Hi. Changsu is here. I already took a 10% commission. Okay. Aren't you going to count it? I'm sure it's all here. Okay then. Don't lose all of that money on a single poker game, you hear? You're not young anymore. It's time you came to your senses. You can't spend your entire life living in jail for other people. I got it. Hey, come here I have a great deal waiting for us. There's nothing for you to do but let me borrow your name. The guys are checking out the market. After three months of operation, they'll disappear. Then the victims will sue, and that buys us five months. So you can get some rest, and then two years of prison time. Two years is too long. Is it? It's better to do a few six-month sentences. But you'll get a lump sum. - Okay, I'll think about it. - Good. - Come out later. - Okay. - I'll buy you dinner. - Sangtae, let's go. She's pretty, too. She's much prettier than her. That's impossible. No one is more beautiful than my Natasha. Do her boobs bounce up and down? Don't call them boobs. You crazy kid. Try some of this. You're the crazy kid. Why don't you just give me instead? No? - Right. No. - Give it. Go and get me two Red bulls. What will I do with him? He's just clueless. - Is it drugged? - Shoot. Sangtae, actually, I couldn't do it last night. Really? I told you not to ask me twice when I tell you something. No, I couldn't. You retard. You took her home, but you couldn't do anything? It's not like that. She's too good for me. I don't know why you had such a useless moment of self-realization. In the end, she's just a woman. It's because you didn't see her. Hey, when I first saw her, I thought it was a freaking dream. You should've had that dream for your own last night. Retard. What would you know? I was just happy for sleeping in the same room. That's a pathetic excuse, you dork. What? What did you say? I'm sorry. Since I've been away, you think you got this town? - I'm sorry. - You little twerp. Did you leave the lights on? Someone is in there. Hello. This isn't a home fit for a human being. I've been cleaning all day with no end in sight. Goodbye. What kind of a guy are you? You're pretty shameless. After making me clean all day long, the least you can do is thank me. Oh, yes. Thank you. But why are you cleaning when it'll just get dirty again? Well, where are you? If you knew where I was, would you rush over here? If you can find me, come to get me, sucker. Where are you? Well, where are you? What a crazy jerk. I'm hungry. The call earlier was from the guy yesterday, right? The guy who punched me and ran away. If he came after me with a knife, would you be able to protect me? Who? The guy from yesterday? Tell him to come. Do you have his number? Call him now and tell him to try his luck here. I'll show him. Mister, who are you exactly? The refrigerator is totally empty with no water to drink. The dishes look like they haven't been used. Mister, are you a spy? Huh? That's a false accusation. Don't you know how serious that is? It's 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. That's a big crime, calumny. I've studied a bit of law. So you're a con man. Why would you say that of all things? This town is so trashy. but I like it, because it's human. Be careful! It's not that wide you think. Living in the world is harder than we think. I don't know how you met a guy like him. Everyone, regardless of how they look, has worries on their mind. And that's life, isn't it? Are you patronizing me? I'm not that pathetic woman who needs someone like you to feel sorry. I'm fine now. Do something funny. What? Just amuse me. Shall I tell you a funny story? Show me with your body. Meow. You're surrounded now. Surrender! Shrimp chips. Shrimp. You are so poor at... Rock, paper, scissors. Rock.Rock. Rock. Scissors. Rock, paper, scissors. Scissors. Move your hand to your mouth. I have no family name. Well, I do have one. Park Changsu. The director of the orphanage gave me his family name. It's not my real one. I'm just Changsu. Changsu. This kid has no family name, either. Who is it? Then, is that kid's birthday May 5, too? Isn't there a hotel around here? No, there isn't. Then, I'll have to sleep here another night. Come and sleep over here. You can sleep up here. It's cold. What? Are you scared of me? You've been talking down to me. But I'm quite old. Then talk down to me, too. I won't eat you up. If we're together, we'll both be warm. I should go. No, no. I'll go up. Changsu, you're very nice. You want to hold me, right? You can hold me if you want. I'm just kidding. Why are you shaking? I don't think this is... I'll get on top of you if you keep this up. Shall we run far away and live together? She left. What are you doing there? Morning exercise. You thought I'd left? Didn't you see my bag inside? If it's inside, I haven't left. What are you doing? Breakfast is ready. Yes, I'm coming. Let's go eat. Aren't you eating with me? I'll eat later. Thanks for the food. What's your relationship with him? Who? The guy who hit you yesterday. He's no one. Want me to get rid of him? Where are you going? I'm not going anywhere. Get your papers ready so that we can begin. I'm not doing it. What? I'm not doing it anymore. Did you take drugs or something last night? What's wrong with you? Why are you grinning and acting crazy? Don't grin. Hey, you can go straight to the place. Okay. Wrap it well. The woman receiving this is really classy. How much is this? This diamond? It's a bit expensive. More than this? Yes, twice more... Then give this to me. Don't worry about the money. Okay. This one? This isn't right. What's the ring for? You had to rot in jail for six months to afford a single ring. For a woman you just spent one night with. If I'd known this, I should've been born as a hot woman. Don't talk crap. You'll give it to her in the bag? Why not? Are you crazy? No one gives a present like that. Oh, brother. You take the ring out of there and put it on her finger, while you're kneeling. I know that, you dork. It's obvious. Everyone knows that. Crazy jerk. You should present it in the box. I'm only giving her the ring, you idiot. Stop acting like you know everything. I already thought it out. I'll suddenly take the ring out and put it on her finger, and it'll move her heart. Then she'll be very surprised. I'd be very surprised if I were a woman. I put in a whole lot of liver. Thank you. Changsu, why do you look so good today? Did you eat something good? I think I'm going to get married. What? What did you just say? And I don't have a mother, so... Who is it? Who's the girl? Oh, my Changsu is getting married. It's not going to be a wedding, just more like a dinner. Hey, hey, hey. You're going to be a human being now. Changsu, I never thought you would meet a nice girl. I guess you've gotten lucky after all. Miyeon. Miyeon, I have some warm sausage. It has intestines and liver inside. I brought everything you like. Come out, Miyeon! You can't be sleeping when you're the one who asked for food. Miyeon. What's this? This is blood. What's with this? What is this? What's going on? Miyeon. You can't be like this. No, this can't be true. Oh, Miyeon, Miyeon. Miyeon! You did the right thing. Congratulations, sir. Good work. Are you staking out or something? Eat something. Huh? Inspector Kim came to the office during the day. He asked about you. Why didn't you tell him I was here? You could've gotten prize money for telling on me. How can you say that to me? Well, shit. You and I aren't blood relatives, and if I want, we can live like strangers. Maybe I should just make money off you. Let's go to the police station. Go where? I'm going to tell them what I saw. Why should I hide here when I didn't kill her? What will you tell them? What are you going to say? You're about to be blamed for everything. You have a long criminal record, and your house is full of evidence. If you go to the police station, the cops will only thank you. If you go now, you'll never enjoy your freedom ever again. I can just tell them that I didn't freaking kill her! I'm going crazy. Why did that girl have to die at my house? Who is it? He's a neighborhood thug from Incheon's Chinatown. Why did she die at his house? Bring him to me. Don't kill him. I want him alive. I lost my bankbook. Yes, this is your ID card. Sir, can you wait a moment? Damn it! I'm dead. Shit! Shit! Do you know the Jiseong clan? You know, the gang that's sweeping the nation? They're going nuts to find you. They've even asked some losers about you. There's a bounty for anyone who gets their hands on you. What do I have to do with them? You know the answer to that. It's about the girl. She was the boss' girlfriend. Is this a freaking surprise? And I heard that the boss is ruthless. We're here. You can get out. You'll be safe here for the time being. How did you know about this place? I know some girls who don't like motel. Fucking here is awesome. Let's have a cup of coffee. Are you still playing with cigarettes? This is quite profitable. The unit price has gone up. This is the way to go. Hello? Did you ask for me? What happened to the casino at Bando Hotel? I sold the shares. On your own? You were at the institution. So I had no other choice. Really? Fine, you did well. You can leave. I'm sure you're busy. What is wrong with you? Is it that hard to catch some thug? I'm sorry. Try harder. Have you been checking up on me? Make a wise choice. Ending up dead only takes a moment. You know him, don't you? I really don't know him. Don't lie to me. He came here all the time. How do you expect me to remember all the people that come here? I think it'll be okay. And above? I checked the opposite side. There's no one. Yes, sir. We're tracking him down. Yes, yes. I was surprised seeing those jerks go in. They were like undercover cops. Those guys... I was just blown away. - Sangtae, if you were a woman... - Yeah. What would be your password? 0000? I've tried it already. 4040. Whose phone is that? It's her phone, isn't it? Why did you take a dead woman's phone? Throw it away. It's just that... I'm worried about your safety. Hey, let's stop the search. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. It's been an hour already. Changsu, is her name Kim Seonhee? She's really pretty. Hey. Hey, man. Oh, it's her! Shit, she's hot. Wow Was the password right? No. Let's go, then. What are you staring at? She won't come back to life. Just be yourself. Remember your motto in life? You wanted to live a cowardly life to survive a very long time. That's true. But I came to think... I never wanted to be born, and I've never done anything what I wanted in my own life. It's always been for everyone else. I should freaking die the way I want. That's what I've been thinking. I don't know who the hell ruined my life, but I want to die on my own terms. I don't care if I regret it later, but once, just this once. Let me do what I want to do. It's your favorite drink. Take your hands off the Mapo development project. What? Jeonghak is on the case. Was that your own decision again? I'm sorry. If it's not final, let Mr. Kim take over. Do you think he can handle it? Are you upset? No, I think it's the right decision. This guy's been working for me for 10 years. He's really good with his job. - Drink up. - Yes. To Dongin Primary School. Cheers! Have a seat. We should've kept in touch. Did you cut all ties now that you're a cop? I don't remember your face. Who remembers everything from primary school? That's what it's supposed to be like. Do you remember everything from primary school? No. Do you remember anything? I remember. See? There's nothing. She's just joking around. This is the phone number that reported me? Call the number. Wait a second. Give it to me. You have to be grateful to me. Do you know how much I spent to get this... Wait a second. Hello and thank you very much - for calling Ocean Nightclub. - Hello? Why haven't you been around? Busy with business? Do you know me? Sure. Last time you came, I brought you a lot of girls. Don't you remember? It's my first time here. Huh? Why are you saying that? I remember all the good-looking guys. - Yongpil. - Yes, sir. Where do you live? What are you doing? Shit, what's up? What's wrong with me? Who are you? Don't you know me? Who the heck are you? Are you crazy? Why are you tying me up? Let me go, you jerks! Who the heck are you guys? What are you doing? What's up? What's going on? Let me go... Hey! You. Did you report a murder recently? What? I know. I'm working right now! That boss is making me do crap. Even if I get fired, I can just get a different job. Hey, I have to hang up. I'm hanging up. Hello? Yes, hello? Is this the police station? What is this? What a freaking... You make me surprised. Who are you? Get up, jerk. Hey. Hey. What is this thing? Who sent you? Hey. Do you know me? Huh? You rat. Hey, do you know me? Who sent you? Hello? Who's out there? What is it? Get in now! Stop! You stop! The Mercedes Benz. It's him, it's that guy. The guy who hit me before. It's him. It's him. You should've looked for it. I couldn't find it. I looked everywhere, even your clothes and the closet. It could've fallen on the floor. I'll look for it. The ring doesn't have an owner now. Why do you want to find it? What is it? Someone was here. Let's go. Why? Run! Hey! Get away from me! Okay now, you son of a... Get away from me! Shit! - You, fucking... - You come here. Snap out of it. Hurry! Move. Hey, where's my bag? - Bag? - Yeah. I moved it to the back storage. Hey, why'd you take it all the way there? You little son of a... That's all for today. Wrap it up now. If anyone mentions wiping this place out... Move. Hey, just... Jeez. Jeez. - How have you been? - Hello. Will you put this on here? Yes, sir. - I'm going. See you. - Bye. That's $3. I see. Hey, have a drink. Sangtae. Let's just go to the guy who can get you on a stowaway boat. I don't think there's any other way out. The kimchi is great. There must be a secret recipe. The kimchi that lady makes is so good. It's not like other kimchi. She is worried about you. How's she doing? I'm having a really hard time, too. Guys are roaming the streets to try and catch you. Your photo is all over the place. I feel like people are following me. How long will you be living like this? Hey, you jerk. I'm just going to... It's really delicious. With your cooking, you should open a big restaurant in downtown. I guess he doesn't eat here anymore. Changsu. He's my friend. I haven't seen him lately. What is it? Where were you? I forgot something. Where are you going? I'll go get some more soju. Forget about soju. I don't want to drink. What's with your face? Were you in another fight? You're too old to be getting into fistfights. Little rascal. I'm going to visit Jaewuk. Who's Jaewuk? The son of the old geezer? He went to the police station. Since he has no guardian, I have to go instead. I'm his parent. Is he an orphan? Yes. Fine. - I'll be back. - Okay. I'll be right back. This kid has no last name, either. Does his birthday fall on May 5th, too? Got it. He's like a sleeping baby. I wonder if he knows how he looks when he sleeps. Playing around... There's nothing useful around here. Just look at the dust on the window. What is this basket? He has so many lighters. He's selling them? Hee Coffeehouse, Sook Coffeehouse Min, Young, Gom Coffeehouse... Huh, he's living in Coffeehouse? Um... I still like him somehow. Sit down, you. Yes. I don't think you need to worry about him. Yes. Yes? Yes, we're still tracking him down. I think we'll catch him soon. Yes, sir. Why did you kill such a nice, pretty girl? I didn't kill her. Please believe me. I told you already. Please call the cops. This is going to hurt a bit. You should've known who she was before you killed her. You'll need two fingers to eat. The choice is yours. What will it be? I'll save your thumb and index finger. Just kill me. Why don't you just kill me? I didn't kill her! Just kill me instead! I'll do it step by step. You must have 200 bones. Just hang in there and you'll win. Save me. I killed her! I did it. I killed her. I did it. I killed her. Why did you kill her? I choked her with my own two hands. You stabbed her. Right, I stabbed her neck with a knife. I killed her, so please save me. You must be very hungry, Changsu. The kids should've fed you. If you keep denying it, your neck is next. Just think of it as bad luck. I stabbed her with my knife because I got mad. Who messed him up? What's going on? I beat him a few times because I got angry. Everyone, outside. It's just the two of us here. No one else is listening. If you tell me the truth, you can live. In fact, I... I want to live. I'm sure you do. Did you kill her? I just... Take him. Are you Park Changsu? You're under arrest for murder. You have the right to remain silent, and you have the right to an attorney. Are you a cop? Get up. Do you know that I killed someone? Be quiet. Am I going to the police station? If you beat up the suspect like that, it makes trouble for us. I killed her. Am I heading to the police station now? I killed her, you jerks! I killed her! All of you, I killed her! I'm going to kill you all! Do you want to die? I'm going to the police station. I killed her! I killed her! Why did you do that? Do you think I got to where I am without knowing what I know? Your leg... Is this what you called we're brother? Do you think you're still my brother? I freaking missed you. Why did it take so long to come to see me? You jerk. I thought you'd changed. If you had been a day later, I was going to sever ties with you. How's it going? This is my home ground. The guy with the biggest crime is the leader here. It's really cool. I can't forget my roots. That's a relief. I'm sorry. About what? Deokhee came in a week ago. I heard about your wedding date. I don't think I can go to your freaking wedding. Even if I can't make it, I'll give you the most cash. Just so you know. That's not necessary. Are you looking down on me just because I'm in jail? Did you know that a cigarette costs more than gold here? I'm selling cigarettes wholesale. In a year, I'll be able to buy a house. It's nothing. I'll get a new house for you and your wife, so just you wait. Huh? You little rascal. It's not an empty promise. Did you ever see me break a promise? Time's almost up. Say your goodbyes. Bye. Changsu. I did it. I told on you. Forget it. Just leave. Don't talk about it. Hold on. I want to say I'm sorry. I was too scared. I know I was shameless, but... Changsu, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. So sorry. Did you get permission to do business? What? Sangtae. I have a good news. What is it? I think I can buy you a house. I don't need a house. Just worry about yourself. Hey, I'm talking here. As a man, you have to hit the jackpot in your life, jerk. Maybe you saved your manhood at the bank. Let me see. Huh? Let me see if you're still man enough. Let me take a look. Changsu, you haven't changed a bit. Have a drink. Sangtae. I won't be living my life the same way. A man should freaking do something. Boss of Jiseong clan goes missing Jiseong clan's successor Kim Doseok takes control Kim Doseok booked on charges of corruption in casino management Kim Doseok released from prison after just four years Is this Chairman Kim Doseok's room? Chairman Kim I'm a very close friend of Chairman. Ask him. Chairman Kim, you know me, right? Chairman Kim, don't you know me? Chairman Kim. Don't you know Miyeon? You know Miyeon. - Take him out. - You jerk. You know Miyeon. It's sweet. You've become quite a great person. I really didn't find my leg's inconvenient when I was in prison. But now that I'm out, it's a bother to be outside without this. The world has gotten so much better. Can I have a cigarette? I don't want anything much. I did have my rates. And if you can pay me well, I'll disappear nice and clean. I know you're a busy person. I've taken up too much of your time. It's just one case. You can't have two culprits, can you? I've taken the punishment, so it's time to pay me. Play this. If you do this, do you think you'll win against the chairman? You should go home early. This must be your summer home. It's quite the palace. Thank you for inviting me here. I really am humbled, sir. You got ahold of something good. There's one motto I have in life. It's to live a cowardly life. But after living my life, I became a coward to myself. And that really was embarrassing. You're such a great man. You may not understand a guy like me. Where is it? Why are you in such a hurry? Give me a million dollars. And you do realize this isn't the original. If something happens to me, all the world will hear the recording. You've learned a bit about the world, I see. I know how to make a deal. I don't think it's such a big request. I know it's not such a big deal to you. Is this the original what you said? It was sent by delivery. Also, here's a letter to the police detective. Do you think I got to where I am without much? What will it be? Do you think I came here without thinking of death? Hello? Forget about the funds in China. You know my investment in the South American mine? Withdraw ten million dollars. I heard that gold prices are high in Hong Kong. Invest all of it in gold. Do what you want with the merchandise from Japan. Something shorter than 16cm won't reach the heart. Do you see what's in the safe? Drink this, and it's all yours. Did you ever see a mouse hold a grudge against a cat? You have to try to escape. If you take on the cat, it'll only benefit the cat. I think you lost this time. If you drink, I'll let you go in peace. Thank you. Thank you for keeping my dignity. Jerk, hit me more. Is that your best punch? Hit me some more. Hit me more. You son of a... How dare you try to fight me? More, more! Why is your punch so weak? You're such a pussy. More, more. Son of a bitch! More, more. You're nothing to me. How dare you, son of a bitch! Jeez. You can only protect your pride if you're strong. Do you jerks know what that is? How dare a guy without a leg try to take me on? Such a clueless jerk. It's already started. You smoke fancy cigarettes, sir. You should've known that your cigarette was poisoned. I told you not to hit women. Now you're getting punished, you son of a bitch. The cigarette tastes nice. Here! It's yours. I've... I've gotten rid of everyone who's been bullying you. Aren't you happy I'm here? I'm happy you're next to me. Let's run far away now. Miyeon. Miyeon. Miyeon, I took down everyone who had bothered you. Lee Miyeon didn't have any connection so it was taken out. Where did you go after calling me here? You don't even have a mobile. I felt rushed. Why are you so happy suddenly? Let's go somewhere to get a cool drink. That sounds great. I know a bar with hot girls. I don't go to bars anymore. That's so tacky. Don't do that. Why are you so happy? Did you take drugs? Uh?
