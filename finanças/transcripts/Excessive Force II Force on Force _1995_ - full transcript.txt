This is Bravo Point. Give me a grid check. Bravo Skylight set. Eagle One is in the nest. This is Groundhog. I'm in the hole. White Horse. White Horse, do you copy? 10-4. White Horse is cranked and ready to run. OK, gentlemen, here comes our bad guy. At the first sign of any hostility, take him out. Franco wants this one clean. Bravo Point, this is Bravo Skylight. I got the client approaching the vehicle. Bravo Skylight, give me a positive I.D. On the target. Hey, how you doing? All right. Bravo Point, this is Bravo Skylight. It's him. One ping for acknowledgment. Bravo Skylight, this is Eagle One. I've spotted three civilians... entering from the west end of the cemetery. Do you confirm? Bravo Point, this is Bravo Skylight. The civilians could be possible hostiles. All right, gentlemen. We know the scenario. Everybody hold your position. This is Groundhog. I got the civilians in my sight. Groundhog, stay with the client. What the... Right here, right here, right here! Entirely too sloppy, gentlemen. Check the client and bag the garbage. Pull back to rendezvous. Oh... shit. This is need-to-know basis only, Buchanon. No one's to be informed of anything... unless first cleared through me. Is that understood? I know the routine, Agent Harris. Good. Is that all? Yeah, that's all. OK. And that's what it looked like? You sure? - Hey! - Oh, yeah, sure. Who was that, Cap? FBI agent... nothing to do with us. What was all that with Ernie? Oh, he claims he saw a hit go down in the cemetery on Third. A hit? That how he described it? Yeah. He said something about arrows and a big hunting knife. Oh, so now we got Indians out there killing people, right? Yeah, and I told him to go crawl back in his bottle. What about a description? A body? Anything? Well, he was crashed out on a grave... so he couldn't see much. What was that on your pad? Oh, that. He, uh, claims that he saw the killer's tattoo... a pregnant dog howling at the moon. No, no. Barking Seals. Naval special forces... Seals... that's their signature. So, somebody pissed off a special forces retired. Look, O'Conner, don't give me any grief about this, please. Query the military and have a black and white... take Ernie to check it out. Goodman, they want you in the evidence room. God. Harly! Cordell, what the hell? I've been all over the base looking for you. Your flight to New York won't wait. Won't need the ride, Deac. I'm not going. What? What does that mean? What's it sound like? I've got some business to take care of first. Did I miss something somewhere? This came in last night from L.A.P.D. You have to have this surgery, Harly. If you don't, you... "Special forces..." Tck. Well, I guess I know better than to try to talk you out of this. But how are you gonna find him? He's like trying to find a shadow in the dark. I'm not stopping till I get him. The operation will have to wait. What can I do to help? I might need someone here to cover me at the base... in case anybody calls. You got it. Anything else? No. That's it. Don't worry, Deac. I'm gonna be fine. All right, I want the expended ammo replaced by tomorrow. You got it. Hey, Martinez, Torres, let's go. Come on. Hey, Cap! - Yo. - We're ready. You did a fine job yesterday, gentlemen. Good teamwork. Except next time, Bobby, anticipate and act. Now, what do I always say? Action is faster than reaction. That's right. Action is faster than reaction. That's the difference between success and failure. I suggest you don't mess up again, Bobby. Be here next Tuesday at 10:00... for a preliminary meeting on the D'Amato mission. What about the money? As usual, I'll deliver it when I receive the rest. Dismissed. Hey, Martinez! Hey, man, let's go get some beer. Sounds good. It's on you, right? Heh. Yeah, right. I'm a little worried about Bobby, Cap. Since he come to L.A., he's been running real loose. That's to be expected. He's from the area. Keep an eye on him. If he doesn't straighten up, I'll talk to him. OK. You know who this is. Two things... Mr. Franco's very pleased. You did a good job. But you might have left a witness. And there's been a change of venue on the other deal. You have a meeting first thing in the morning. Call me. What do you think happened? We'll soon find out. Yeah, this is Lydell. Just tell me who and where we can find him. It's no problem. No, man... hey, hey, hey, hey. Check it out... white boy in a suit. What the hell is he doing in our cemetery? Can I help you? - Hey! - Yeah! Yo, Five-O! Oh. Should I kill a cop today? - No. - Do it, yeah. Not today. Unh! Aah! - There you go. - Ha ha ha! Stupid cop. Dude's in the wrong neighborhood. You got that? - What was that? - What's going on? Please give me what you took from the detective. Ha ha! Ls this chick serious or what? What the hell's she talking about? My mother taught me to be polite... so I'll say it again. Please. That was nice. Sure was. I'll remember you were polite when I'm doing you. I'm gonna cut you. I tried to be polite. Ow. Aah. You know, you shouldn't get so buried in your work. It might kill you. Lieutenant Harly Cordell, C.I.D.C. Where's your partner? C.I.D.C. Doesn't always work in teams. You did that all by yourself? Oh. They were very rude. Thanks for that extra set of cuffs. No problem. So, what's the army's criminal investigation command... doing here in L.A., Lieutenant Cordell? Didn't you fax us regarding a murder? Yeah. So? Well, I was down here on other business. They sent me this to check out, too. Oh, come on. I'm not an idiot. You got on a $500 silk jacket. You show up here from out of nowhere... kick ass, take names like a pro. Something's up with you, Miss Cordell. The jacket I bought in Singapore. It cost me $85 and a pair of fatigues. Here's the number to my superior officer... Major Deacon. You can contact him. And as far as kicking ass and taking names like a pro... I've had extensive training. Relax, detective. It wasn't me here last night. And I suppose you have an alibi for that, right? I'd like to speak... with the homeless man who reported the murder. Yeah, well, good luck. Ernie moves around quite a bit. That's why I thought I'd ask you. You know the streets. Ha ha! Yep. So, you from around here? Chicago, originally. - Married? - No. Why not? Could we stick to less personal questions, please? Just trying to get to know you. Like your style. Ooh. You got... Hey! Unless you want to lose that hand... you won't try that again without permission. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's just an old scar I'm a little self-conscious about. That's OK. Ernie usually has breakfast over here behind this bakery. Well, meet Ernie. What happened? Yeah, I slapped him good, Cap. Now, you got nothing to be worried about. Yeah. Yeah. Well, dip me in pork fat. Lydell, you ain't never gonna believe this. Well, no one saw anything. No one heard anything. No one, nothing, doo-da doo-da doo-da. You can put that to music in this neighborhood. Do you think this was connected to yesterday? No. Why, do you? Why would anybody kill him if it wasn't? Looks professional to me. Well, no offense, but the kids in this neighborhood... learn to handle a knife before they're three. Ahd if Ernie was flashing the cash... I gave him last night? Ha ha! I'll take you back to your hotel. Where are you staying? I'm at the Barclay... but I have a rental car back at the cemetery... Well, I'll take you back to your car. - I'll call a cab. - I won't hear of it. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. I don't drink. Well, then, a cup of coffee. I'm easy. Heh heh. Ha ha ha! I'll bet you are. - How you doing, Ray? - All right, Harris. Here's your breakfast, D'Amato. Oh, what have we today? Let's see. Pancakes, sausage... crap! Fast-food joints never use garlic. This stuff could gag a maggot. You should know. - What did you say? - You heard me. Let's get going, Ray. Yeah, sure. Why not? I feel like singing my ass off today. Good. May 28th, second day of taped testimony... for Bartholomew "Barty D" D'Amato. Ahem. Good morning, Franco. How you doing? I guess you're wondering what I'm doing... sitting in this hole eating this garbage... instead of going home for the Memorial Day weekend. Because I got no family to go home to no more. You took care of that. But I got one message for you. This is what happens... when a moron like you rolls downhill... because guess what I'm going to tell... these nice federal boys today. Everything. All of it, you piss-ant scumbag! Everything! Yeah. Oh... Atta girl. Hey, babe. Thanks for letting me use your pool. There's a party tonight at Georgette's... if you're free. Oh, I wouldn't miss it. You, uh, you come and get me. God damn, Lydell... that dog hunts! She does. How the hell am I supposed to tell Bobby... to keep a low profile, you living like this? We got more trouble than we can handle, cuz... and you're running around... playing water games with high-class pussy! I work hard, and I play hard, right? Yeah. Now, if I want to rent canyon houses... and screw wannabe starlets, that's my business. Is that clear, corporal? Good. Do... something. I don't want Franco to think anything's wrong. What about Cordell? Come on, Yates, you're positive it was her, no doubt? That was her, Cap. I checked. How the hell did she survive? That's Franco. What are we going to do? Don't sweat the small shit, Yates. We'll just kill her again. Please note that, unlike the cerebral cortex... each half of the cerebellum... receives from and controls muscles... on the same side of the body. Mm-hmm. Now, tomorrow on rounds... I'm gonna want two to three possible treatment scenarios... on every case we see. Understood? Yeah. Oh, and, uh... Miss McCarthy. Next time, no matter how well-endowed he is... try not to say "Oh, my God"... when a male patient drops his shorts. On the plus side, I think he, uh... truly appreciated the compliment. OK, that's it for today, kids. We'll see you tomorrow. And, Wilbur, I want to see those case studies... first thing in the morning. Yes, Dr. Prender. Bye. What are you doing here? You've got trouble, Mr. Lydell. - Such as? - Don't be coy with me. Why is this military investigator... suddenly looking for you? Let me assure you, Mr. Franco... that is in no way connected to your situation... and it's under control. We have a more immediate problem. Carmine. They've moved D'Amato. Here's his new location. We want this done yesterday. We can't take the chance they'll move him again. Jesus, Cap, this is the... The original plan won't actually change that much. We can utilize the Memorial Day weekend coming up. It will cost more. Vinnie. Will that cover it? Most definitely. Here's a man we've owned for a long time. He'll provide you with information... building plans, rosters, whatever you need within reason. You've hired the absolute best, Mr. Franco. We'll handle it. There's a new condition, and this is not negotiable. Things being the way they are, we need absolute verification. Like? His hand, for fingerprints. Not a problem. There better not be. Vinnie, call him and tell him I'll meet him on the third tee. Let's go. I missed you... and I can't believe you haven't been seeing someone, Harly. Not from a lack of offers. More like a lack of desire. How long are you here for? I don't know. Sort of an open-ended assignment. I don't know how much time we'll have. What are you working on? OK. I don't want to know or even care for that matter... just so long as we can spend a few nights together. Whoa, wait, where do you think you're... The bullet fragment shifted? I was going to ask. I need that refilled. You know, you shouldn't even be driving on this stuff... let alone working as an active agent. Now, what's going on? Hey, it's easy enough for me to find out. You poking around might cause me problems. Oh, you mean besides the one that you obviously already have? I've got some things I have to take care of. Are you going to help me or not? You know, if you don't, I'll find someone who will. You knew I would do this when you came here, didn't you? Tch. Yeah. Come on. Pick your head up. We are dead men. We are walking dead men. We got the cops, mob... now this bitch ghost chasing our asses. Are you through whining? I ain't whining. Good. We're going to make this thing work. - Come on, Lydell. - Listen to me! I want you to go pick up Bobby... and I want you to drop him at the unit. He and I have to work on reshaping the charges... for the new location. Then I want you to go get Martinez... and I want you to go to the hotel... where Cordell is staying, and I want you to fix that problem. Uh, I got a bad feeling about that whole thing. Listen, Yates, fear is natural. It's how we respond to that fear that defines us as men. Now, are you with me? Huh? Yeah. Yeah. I'll fix it. You just... you leave it to me. Cut that angle off, Marco! Yeah, that's it, baby! Good play! DJ, stay up on your toes, man, come on. Come on, man! What you talkin' about? - That's it. - Unh! Watch it, man, I'm up by two. All right, everybody hit the showers. Let's go. That's it. That's enough for today. Come on, hustle it up now. Let's go! Hustle it up. Genard, don't take the soap home. - Harly. - Hi, Grant. What the hell you doing in this neighborhood? Your office buddy at the V.A. Told me I could find you here. Who'd you bribe to get this job? Amazing what you can do with the G.I. Bill... and a little bit of whining. So, where's Bobby Tucci these days? You know, Harly, it couldn't have been him. I made a mistake. That report that you turned in said otherwise. Now, cut the crap, Grant. I need to know this straight. All right, I was at this chichi downtown... underground-type club... you know, the kind of joint... you can get whatever you want. You know what I mean? You? This may come as a great shock to you, Harly... but I don't get much action anymore... you know what I'm saying? Anyway, I thought I saw somebody who looked just like Bobby. He walked in the club, went on upstairs. He didn't see me... and I didn't bother to stick around to find out. This will get you in. You know, not once... not once did Bobby... ever come to visit me in the hospital... after I stepped on that land mine. I mean, I can't say I blame him all that much. Tucc is what he is. Hey, Grant, if I get the shot before I go... it's beers and steaks on me. Hey, Cordell, if it is him and you do happen to see him... you tell him... you tell him to go suck on a wet doorknob. I did fine without him. You sure did, Grant. Absolutely. Genard, what the hell you doing leaning... up against the fence like some rock star? Don't let me catch up with you! What do you want, Brutus, huh? Damn! Al Capone, give me a break here! Get lost, dyke, before I shove something... between your legs you can't get out! Ooh, do tell. Let's go, Bobby! Business! Where are my smokes? I'll catch you later. No, you'll catch me now, or you won't catch me later. Fuck you! Oh, yeah? With what, pencil dick? I don't think so! Hey, fuck you! What are you grabbing? There's nothing there, Bobby! What the hell are you doing? We got the sky falling around our ears... and you're shoving that brain poison up your nose! Bobby, come on! You got to get straight! Get straight quick! This is not the time to be running loose... and messing around with bitches... who ain't sure if they're boys or girls! You understand what I'm saying? - OK, man. - You get me? - Yeah, man. - You do? Shit! Come on, Harly! Come on! You want some? Come on! All right. That's my basic idea. How long will your end take? About an hour. Once the charges are shaped... the rest is just a matter of making it go boom. - Good. - We done? Yeah, for today. Be here tomorrow morning for a full team meeting. I, uh... I could use a little extra money. How much? Couple hundred. When this mission is over, you better act like a pro, Bobby. Or I will kick your fucking teeth in. - Is that clear? - Yep. Get out of here. What happened? Well, it ain't good, Cap. Just tell me she's dead. Where is she? I lost her. - You lost her. - Yeah. What is wrong with you, Yates? Get back out there and look for her, you idiot! Where? Our mutual friend Mr. Franco told me... to call if I needed anything. I have to locate someone A.S.A.P. That's right. Oh, yeah! Can I help you? Go on in. Bourbon, straight. Hi! I haven't seen you here before. New in town. Really? Well... Hey, cute tattoo. You should see the one I have here. Come on, let's go. Oh... Thank you, God! This is gonna be great. You're really gonna like this. Do you want a big wedding or maybe a little wedding? A little wedding is OK if you want that. I always thought maybe I'd open... a tool and die shop in Wisconsin... but I'm not quite sure what a tool and die shop is. You know, four kids would be good... but three is better if you want three. I was thinking dogs, but if you want cats... - You know what? - What? I've got to go to the ladies' room. OK. - Will you wait for me? - Yeah. You know, I was thinking I could get tickets... to the tractor pull for Thursday night if... Can I help you? I'm looking for a ladies' room. There's one downstairs. Are you sure there's not one... Hey, I said it was downstairs. Unh! Aah! Sorry. I'll find it myself. - Oh! - Yeah! Oh! Sorry. See? I didn't even want to hit you! I didn't want to hit you! But, you see, nobody cheats me, Bob. Nobody cheats me! Bobby, sweetie, nobody! Take it easy with him, please. Back off, ho! This is mine. Oh, unless you want to go a few rounds with me. No problem. I'll start with one round at your knee... and I'll work my way up. Don't even gotta be like that. Wallet, please. Thank you. Move aside. Stop there. Hey, where do you think you're going? Unh! Whoa! What do you think you're doing, man? Close that door! Bitch! Damn, Bobby! Bobby, you got to cut out the fried foods. $50? Come on, I'm not going to pay $50 for this! You're crazy! Come on! Get in here! I thought you were dead, Cordell. How you been? Fine, Bobby. You? I've been better. My head hurts. It's been nice seeing you. Grant had a message for you. Grant? Hey! Private Goldman reporting for duty, ma'am! Better put that thing at ease, soldier. Hey! What about the tractor pull on Thursday night? You still want to go? Ow! That had to hurt. He... he don't look real good. - Damn. - Hey! What's going on down there? Nothing! He just... he just dove right over the rail! Hey, wait! You going back to the bar? Jesus, Harly. What the hell happened to you? I want to know what it is you're working on... that could possibly be more important... than your having this operation. Don't look at the light. Look at my finger. I mean, without it, you're going to die. It's that simple. It's not that simple. It's a dangerous procedure. More dangerous than dying? We both know dying... isn't the worst thing that could happen. Look, you faced this four years ago. I took you through it then... and I'm gonna get you through it now. No job's worth losing your life, Harly. It's my decision. I say no. What is this? Damn it. Map grid coordinates. Really? Ahem. What does nitro and C4 have to do with map grids? Just forget about it. OK? Breathe. I told you I don't want you involved in this. Honey, you specifically involved me in this... when you came into my office... and screwed me to get that medication. What? I don't like being used, Harly. I'm not using you. Look... cut the innocent crap. I know you. I want some answers, and I want them now. It's simple. This is about someone who took my life away four years ago... someone who doesn't deserve to live one more second. Wait, you found the sniper? Yes. But trust me, that's all you need to know. Fine. Aah! Excuse me. That hurts. Well, then take a deep breath. Is this your subtle way of telling me that you're angry? What if something happens to you, huh? What am I supposed to do then? Oh, forget it. You're fine. Wash yourself up. I've always known who shot me. I'm listening. My team was on R and R in Riyadh. That, you knew. Lydell was our field commander. He and I were... lovers. Oh, man. I swear to God, Harly, if you got any better, I'd die. Ow! We're on R and R, Frank. Do you have to wear that damn thing everywhere? Yes, I do. Ahh. So... did you think about what we talked about? Oh, hey, don't get all fucked up about it, sweetie. It was just a crazy idea anyway. You know how shit gets in-country. Heh. You lose perspective. Heh. You just forget I said anything. OK? Better yet... let me help you. Hey, Cordell, come on out, man! Hurry up, man! Come on out and get a brewski! We ain't got all day! Ha ha ha! Hey, Cordell! Lydell wanted to form a private assassination squad... with the other spec-fors after the tour. He obviously didn't take no for an answer graciously. That's how you and I met over the operating table in Saudi. Jesus, Harly. I mean, didn't you ever tell anybody else about this? Of course, but all of Lydell's team... was reported dead or missing in action. No one believed me. That's why I became an investigator. I followed every rumor I've ever heard. All I want... is to live one second longer than Lydell. So, now that you know everything... can I borrow your car? She had a tattoo where? Here? No, on the other arm and further up. Man, what a hump she would've been, you know? We would have plowed the back forty. She would've wrapped those buns of steel around me... All right, all right, all right, that's enough. We'll call you if we need any more information. Well, how am I supposed to get home? Oh, you step outside with those undies on... tck, somebody will pick you right up. Funny. Why don't you think... about growing some hair on your head? Well, I guess you showed me. Now, get the hell out of here... so I can serve and protect your sorry ass. Yeah, this is O'Conner. I'm going to need a bolo put out on a Cordell, first name, Harly. She's wanted for questioning in a homicide. If you knew the argument that I just had with myself... I'll be careful with it. Heh. I don't give a damn about the car, Harly. I just... I don't know what to say to you anymore. Just say that you trust me enough... to let me finish this my way. Damn it, Bobby... I know you got some money around here somewhere. So touching. Oh! In mourning for him, are you? Oh, great! Catwoman's back for more fun and games. I have to talk to you, please. You know... take this! I'm telling you... Aah! Doesn't anyone understand "please" anymore? OK, OK. It's only a few questions, that's all. You're hurting my arm, and you're getting on my nerves! - Man, check this out! - Good evening, gentlemen. Will you excuse us for a moment, please? Just for two minutes, I promise. That's all I need. Thanks. I appreciate it. All I need is a simple address. Well, then call the telephone company... 'cause you don't know these guys like I do. They will hurt me, princess. If you give me what I want, then I guess... you have nothing to worry about, do you? Psh! Yeah, right, whatever. OK, well, I tried. Bye. Hey, where are you going, lethal weapon? Oh, I thought I'd go and leave you here... to play house with the homeboys. Tell 'em I say hi. Whoa, yeah! Ha ha ha! Hey! Hey, Dirty Harriet, all right! You just hooked into directory information. It's a house on Topanga Canyon. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - What? - Don't touch my hair. Hey, I'm serious. Don't touch my hair. Ha ha! Jeez... I'll get some more wine. Don't go anywhere. Where would I go? I get lost so easily. Ha ha ha ha! That particular wine should be served chilled... but you won't have that option where you're going. I heard a rumor you were alive. I didn't believe it, of course. Normally, the people I kill stay dead. Oh, Lydell, you still say the sweetest things. You may not believe this, Harly... but I've regretted that night all these years... more than you can imagine. That makes me feel so much better. Step into the light. I want to see your face clearly... when I blow your eyes out one at a time. Come on, Harly, you don't have it in you. You never did. This time, you're going to be dead wrong. Hey, babe, where'd you disappear to? Come on! Shit. Move your ass! Let's go! No. They'll take me to jail. You too, for aiding and abetting. You need to go to the hospital, Harly. - Just sew me up. - With what? Don't you have a black bag? Yeah, it's got my golf clubs in it. I'm a neural oncologist, not Doogie Howser. Then get me a needle and thread, and I'll do it myself. Ooh, tough girl. She's going to eat the bullets and spit 'em out. They didn't hit anything vital. How do you know? You got X-ray vision? Now, look, be still. I can't think with you acting like a kid who has to piss. Yeah, well, what are we going to do about Cordell? I mean, first, Martinez, then Bobby. I mean, this bitch ain't going to stop at two. I mean, damn it, Frank, I can't believe you're being... so "So what" about this whole thing. Because I move past things quicker than you. Yeah, well, moving on is a goddamn good idea! I mean, how about we move on out of this town? Because we have a contract to finish! Jesus, Frank! You are going over the edge, buddy. You are fucking drunk on money! Gaah! Listen to me. We have taken nearly a million dollars... of front money from these people. If we don't do as contracted... Cordell is going to be the least of our problems. They will find us wherever we go. - Do you understand that? - Yeah. Besides, no bitch is going to determine my destiny... not then, not now, not ever. Now, go gather up the team and bring them back here. And, Yates, if you say anything... other than we move the mission forward... I will kill you. Yeah. You know who this is. I require some information on the duty roster... Listen to me, you cop whore. You do as I ask, or I'm going to talk to the man... that makes your lifestyle... or rather, your death style, possible. Do you understand me? What's that for? Lt's going to numb the area, so I can stitch it up. You always were the best field doctor I knew. I'm sorry about this, David. I didn't have anywhere else to go to. You know, I still can't believe you've kept all this from me. I never thought I'd find Lydell. He was a ghost or a rumor I chased from city to city. You know, ever since I've known you... you've carried around an obsession to kill a man. Never, not once did you ever mention that. How do you think that makes me feel? What else you got locked away in there? You feel that? - No. - Too bad. You know, you're going to have to let this go, Harly. I will, just as soon as Lydell is... What? Dead? I mean, that is what you were going to say, isn't it? I don't want to talk about this anymore. You know, I always thought that maybe I loved you. Thing is... I don't think I can love someone... whose only goal in life is to kill or be killed. Well, after I finish this... I want you to leave. Don't come back... ever. - Everything OK? - Yeah. How's he doing? He hasn't moved all morning. Let's get his ass up. Yo, D'Amato. You want something to eat before we start this again? You know what you can do? Take your big light and your boyfriend... and go catch a bus. I'm tired of talking into a camera... and I'm tired of smelling the two of you all day long. And don't bother me no more. I'm taking a nap! At least he's in a better mood. Real sweetheart. These are to prevent infection. You take two a day for fourteen days... if you live that long. David... we don't have to do this. Yes, Harly, we do. Good-bye. All right, the charges will blow up and out... creating diversions. Responding emergency services will block traffic. That's when we move. Now, does anyone see any problems? - No. You see any problems? - No, I don't see any. Good. Let's go over it one more time. Yates, you will bring the van... around to the front of the building. You got a copy of the Hughes file for me? Got it right here. You know that evidence we have is circumstantial. Can I help you? No, thank you. I was just coming to see you. That's funny, because my desk is that way. And you're under arrest. Let's go. - Give me a hand with this. - Right away. All right, who's got the chart? Who's got the ammo? We're loaded up. We're fine. Great. Got it. Just lock it down. Everybody in? Everybody got their guns? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Put it back there. - I'm set. Have a seat. I told you I was coming to see you. But you forgot to put a quarter in the meter... and you were on your way to take care of it, huh? - This isn't a joke, O'Conner. - And I'm not laughing! You're implicated in at least two homicides... you have a gun here that can blow a hole... through an elephant at a half a mile... and you have the service records... from two dead special forces, one of whom... excuse me... two dead special forces... one of whom was found dead in a bar... after you were seen with him. I'm not even sure you are who you say you are. And you expect me to believe you? Yes. Who in the hell would attack a police station? I don't know, O'Conner. I just discovered this myself. Well... when does this attack happen? I don't know. Quit jerking me off. Why would I make up a story like that? Well, to quote you, Lieutenant Cordell... "I don't know." Now, when you start coming up with some answers... that even remotely make sense, we'll talk. Until then, I'm going to figure out... how many charges I'm going to slap you with. You're making a huge mistake. Yeah? Well, I've done that before. I'll live. Where in the hell is Buchanon? I got one mother of a problem. He stepped outside. He'll be back in ten minutes. Pfft! Yes. Bobby, he's on his way. Don't wait. Excellent. Make sure you terminate our contract. Of course. You said you wanted to work the night shift. You cuff him or not? Because I have to talk with my old lady. Hey! I need to see Officer O'Conner. Is he here? Do you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. He's not in the squad room right now. Can you find him, please? Lady, he'll be back in a minute. Sit down and relax. She's in interrogation at the far end of the squad room. You tell Franco, debt paid. Don't be calling me again. I'll relay the message. You should be able to handle Cordell. I'll do D'Amato myself. You can handle Cordell? Like a dead bird in heat. Look, at least wait till I can get out of here. Of course. What are you... What the hell are you... Aah! Aah! Let's go. All right, folks. Watch your step. What the hell was that? What's going on? Hey. Hey! Let's go, McMahon. There's just been a report of a bus blowing up downtown. Wonder what the hell's going on out there. What the hell is that? Let's go! Come on, out! Freeze! Keep your back up, guys. Go on. Straight through the back. Over there. Go down that way. Down that way! Down the corridor! Come on! Let's go! Ray, go check it out. Over here! Oh, God! Got that covered? Yeah. Watch your back. You see anything? Over here. Got Williams down here. OK. Go back and get an ambulance. We got a man down here. Freeze! You're lucky I'm not like Lydell, Yates. Then maybe I am like him. - Don't shoot, don't shoot! - What's going on? Someone's attacking the station. You should've stayed at home, Cordell. You never really cut it with the big boys. Why? Because I don't shoot unarmed women in bed, Lydell? Oh... I'm telling you, it's Franco. Now let's get out of this coffin. Shut up! You don't know Franco. Hey, Barty D! Message from Franco. Just like target practice. How many holes do you think I can get through your head... before you get off one shot? Well, you've always been pretty good with a handgun. I'd guess... C'est la vie. We got the back covered! We got the back covered! Reinforce the front! Let's go! OK, we got it. Get out of the way! What the hell... Cordell. Shit. I don't believe it, man. All right, Cordell. You want to play? Come on. Come on, baby. Look at that! Look at that! Somebody get some help! Did you see that? Somebody dial 911! Help them, man! Help them! Shit! You know, Cordell... things would have been a lot simpler... if you had just joined the team when I asked. It wasn't really the asking. It was the way you took my answer. Go ahead and laugh. It'll all be over in a few seconds. After all this time, and you miss? I want you to live in hell, Lydell. What's the matter, Cordell? You seem rather sick to me. You're a good soldier, Cordell. It pains me to have to do this. Especially when I think of you on your back... with your legs up in the air. I wouldn't mind doing you one more time. But all good things come to an end. Fuck! All right, no more fucking around, you bitch! Just one second... longer. You going to stay with us this time? How do you feel? Dead. Well, not quite, but you gave it your best shot. Looks like the surgery was successful. You don't, um, remember my last visit. No. You know, you asked me to marry you. Yeah, right. Oh, it's OK. I, um... I didn't say yes, anyway. You didn't? Nope. Didn't want a felon for a wife. That's all right. As soon as I'm healed, I'm going back to ORD. Yeah. I kind of figured that. To resign my commission. I'm through playing soldier. I thought maybe you and I could play doctor for a while. Well, I mean, I'm not going to argue with you. You carry a big gun. And don't you ever forget it.
