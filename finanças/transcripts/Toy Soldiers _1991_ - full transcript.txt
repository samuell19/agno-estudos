(GUNFIRE) (MAN SHOUTING ON BULLHORN) (MACHINE GUN FIRE) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (MAN ON TV SPEAKING SPANISH) (MAN SPEAKS SPANISH) Waiting for your reply. (SPANISH REPEATS) Waiting for your reply! (SPANISH) I cannot do anything. Your father is already in American hands. We are watching the airport. His plane has not taken off. You are watching the wrong plane. Your father was taken from a military base this morning. You are lying. (SPANISH) We must act. (GUN CLICKING) (SHOUTS IN SPANISH) Let's go! (SCREAMING) (PEOPLE GASPING) (MAN ON TV CONTINUES SPEAKING SPANISH) Luis. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (MAN ON TV SPEAKING SPANISH) "We interrupt our coverage to bring you this report..." "...live via satellite from the United States..." "...as extradited narcotics trafficker..." "...Enrique Cali arrives at Homestead Air Force Base near Miami, Florida..." "even as the gunmen here at the Palace of Justice continue to demand his release." (SPANISH) Very well. (SPANISH CONTINUES ON TV) (SPANISH) We have to go, Judge! (SHOUTS IN SPANISH) Move forward! Hurry up! (MEN SHOUTING) (SHOUTING IN SPANISH) (SPANISH) (SCREAMING) (BELL TOLLING) (BELL TOLLING CONTINUES) (TOLLING STOPS) Hey, bring that back here! (LAUGHING) (CAN SPRAYING) BOY: Hey, Frank! Frank, over here! (CHATTERING) Frank, over here! - Looking for this, Frank? - Very funny. Hey, hey, hey, hey! The Dean's waiting for you guys back in your room. A pleasure knowing you. These two gentlemen are deputy United States marshals. They wish to have a word with you, Mr. Donoghue. - Me? - Mm-hmm. Let us have the room. Close the door behind you. MARSHAL: It's, uh, just a precaution we're taking... with everyone involved in the Enrique Cali case. Especially with your father since he's presiding in the case. My father's been a federal judge since I was five years old. - (TALKING CONTINUES) - (WHISPERING) What's he saying? - You saw what happened... - They're talking about Phil's dad. - He's a judge, right? - Yeah. It was on all three networks. The boys are not allowed TVs in their rooms. Luis Cali, his son, is, uh, passionately devoted to his father. Took over the palace of justice down there trying to get his father back. The judge and two others were killed. - Is he in trouble? - No. - Something about Colombia. - Good coffee. Now, you know why they have to take these precautions. Your whole family will be put in a very safe place. They're taking him out today. Oh, hey, hey, hey! Where? We can't tell you that, son, but it will be a secure military installation. You gentlemen may as well come in, help your roommate pack. See you soon. Good luck. We look forward to having you back. - Thanks, sir. You too. - All right. - Billy. - BOY: See you later, Phil. Rock 'n' roll. Were you off campus yesterday? I'm on probation, sir. I'm not allowed off campus. Oh, that's right. I forgot. You know, somebody spray painted the Sheriff's car yesterday. - Wrote the word "rejects" all over it. - No kidding. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. All right, you got away with it this time. But just remember, I'm always gonna be watching you. (BELL TOLLING) (RUSTY GATE CLOSING) - (TOLLING CONTINUES) - MAN: Lights out, boys. BOYS: Eat shit, Mr. Peterson! (TOLLING CONTINUES) There go the Dean and the Headmaster. (RHYTHMIC CLANGING) I can't go, man. This paper's due in the morning. (RHYTHMIC CLANGING) - Come on. They're ready. Let's go, let's go. Come on. Come on! Let's go. Billy, this is your homework. That's good. That's good. Come on. Let's go. JOEY: Take it easy, man. You're gonna break the window. - BILLY: Am not. - (GLASS SHATTERING) - (SNEEZES) - Shut up, Snuffy! Blow me. (SNIFFLES) Watch your head, man. That's like a spinal injury, man. - Quiet. - (LAUGHING) I know you're mad, brother. Nice hole, Billy. Speaking of holes, anyone have a sister? Call her up. - I saw Joey's mom at the mall. - Saw his mom? (CONVERSATION CONTINUES, INDISTINCT) JOEY: You guys better leave my mom out of this. I love my mom. And you can, too, for 12 bucks. As long as you're not talking about my mother, everybody's cool. Alright make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen. The bar is open. - Mr. Trotta, why don't you tend the bar? - Mouthwash? Yes, mouthwash. Or maybe not. What's the deal, Billy? You trying to tell me my breath stinks? I wasn't saying your breath stinks. Why do you take everything so personally? Damn, Hank. I don't think that smoking when you have asthma is such a good idea, Snuff. - Smoking isn't such a good idea, period. - Gentlemen. - Here's to Mr. Donoghue. - Yes, to Phil. - May he get laid while on the outside. - Amen. - This better not be mouthwash. - Trust me. (GAGGING, COUGHING) "Trust me." Asshole. This is mouthwash. No, it's not. Tastes like mouthwash. What the hell is it? Four parts 100 proof vodka, two parts peppermint schnapps for that mouthwash flavor... And one part cr√®me de menthe to make it green. Damn. You're a sick man. I hope you know that. That's the beauty of this concept. It looks and smells and tastes just like mouthwash. We can keep liquor in plain sight in our dorm rooms, right? And the best part, I sold 8 bottles of this stuff for 35 bucks apiece. - We are rich. - Ooh, brother, you is a genius. A lunatic, but a genius. Mix me up another shot. I'll work on the entertainment. Man, this stuff is great. It's opening up my lungs, it's making me breath easier. Evidently, it's making you fart easier too. I didn't fart. It's the first rule of prep school etiquette: When you're in a basement with no windows, don't fart. No, the first rule of prep school etiquette is to pretend you're asleep when your roommate's beating off. The first rule of prep school etiquette is to wait until your roommate falls asleep before beating off. Was that a personal remark directed at me, roommate? - You choke your chicken. It's yours. - You slap your monkey all the time. I can't sleep at night. - Speaking of beating off. - (LINE RINGING) I'll do the talking. Hello? (WOMAN'S VOICE ON PHONE) This is Jennifer. What's your name? Steve. Well, hello, Steve. Mmm. Oh, I like that name. Oh, tell me what you look like. Um... well, I got blond hair... And, um, I wear an earring in my left ear. About five-nine, 150 pounds. - Did I mention I'm black? - (EXHALES) JENNIFER: Sounds very sexy, Steve. - Oh, I like long, blond hair on a black man. - (CHUCKLING) Oh, I also got long, blonde hair. I'm not black, but I'm very, very tanned. I'm wearing black lace bra and panties that look really hot against my skin. Oh! Would you like me to take my bra off? Yes. Yes, please. (LAUGHING) JENNIFER: Oh, my nipples are dark red. Oh, very big, very hard. Oh! Oh! I'm rubbing my breasts. Oh, it feels so good. (MOANING) Steve, I'm running my hands down over my body now. Oh! Oh! - Slipping my thumbs inside my panties. - Slip 'em in. Slip 'em in. I'm completely naked except for black stockings and high heels. Would you like me to leave them on or take them off? Take them off. Now. On. On. On. Leave them on. (BABBLING) Why don't you go ahead and leave them on? Oh, Steve, oh, you're so wicked. - I like it. Oh. Ooh. Oh. - She likes it. She likes it. It's so soft, so big. Oh, I just wanna touch it. You want me to touch it, don't you, Steve? Yes. (CLEARS THROAT) By all means, touch it. - Oh, Steve. Oh, my God! - Touch it, baby, touch it. - Oh, Steve! - Outstanding! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hide it. Everybody move. Mr. Tepper. Why am I not surprised? (LAUGHS) This is ingenious. Thanks. It was nothing. What's this? - Mouthwash? - Oh, come on, Mr. Tepper. You expect me to believe you crawled down to the basement just to drink mouthwash? - I'm trying to fight plaque. - Right. Gingivitis. Tartar buildup. I got a little... - Are you alone down here? - Yes, sir. - Where's your roommate? - Up in his room, I guess. - (SNUFFY SNEEZES) - Shit. Watch your mouth. Come on out, Mr. Bradberry. You too, Mr. Trotta. May as well come out. He was bluffing. - Gesundheit. - Thank you. DEAN: Mr. Giles and Mr. Montoya, come out now. Or I'll place a guard on this basement, have a bed check of the entire school. Gentlemen, I want you see you all in my office... at 9:00 A.M. sharp tomorrow morning. Go to your rooms now. Move! Not you, Billy. This... you know, this is really, really ingenious. No, noth... just, uh, put the little... - Where'd you get this stuff? - Radio Shack. Really? Was it expensive? No, no, I picked it up on sale. On sale. Good. Here. - Break it. - What? Throw it on the floor. Smash it. Use your foot. Come on, come on. Use your foot. Make believe it's my foot. Smash it. (PLASTIC SHATTERING) That's enough. Let's go. (SIREN WAILING) This is the U.S. Border Patrol! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPANISH CONTINUES) (GRUNTS) (SPANISH) You think you're the first kid to put liquor in mouthwash bottles? It was done in my day. (CHUCKLES) I might have even done it myself. (KNOCKING) Mr. Kouf, Mr. Greenwalt. Mr. Tepper here sold you a bottle of mouthwash with vodka in it? You will not be punished if you give it to me in five seconds. Good. Good night. - Who's next? - If you're gonna kick me out, kick me out. Don't make me look like a narc to my friends. If we expelled you, that'd make four prep schools in four years. You trying for the guinness book of records? No, sir. Should we try this one? How 'bout this one? This one? Ah. Yes. (KNOCKING) Mr. Burg, Mr. Zarpas. Billy Tepper sold you a bottle of vodka. You have until the count of three to hand it out here. One, two... - Good. Good night. - (DOOR CLOSES) - Now, where to next? - You made your point. I can't fake you out. Fine. I admit it. Don't put me through this anymore. I'm sorry, but I will not have alcohol in my dormitories. Then I'll get it. I'll bring it to you. - How many more are there? - Eight. - You better not lie to me. - Eight. I believe you. I'll be in my apartment. You have ten minutes. (SIGHS) Do you think we should expel you? Do whatever you want. I'm not about to beg to stay in this school. If we threw you out, who would you live with? Your mother or your father? I don't exactly have a burning desire to live with either one of them. Then what's behind this perverse desire to constantly risk getting thrown out of school? You think I set out to get caught? I don't think you do it purely for fun. I was having loads of fun until you came along. - Look, should I pack or what? - Shut up and sit down. Stop acting like such a tough guy. It doesn't impress me. I'm not going to expel you. Three schools have done that and it's obviously done nothing for your character. - Are you listening to me? - Yes, sir. I'm gonna do much worse. I am going to keep you here until you graduate. It will probably take years at this rate. I might wear you out before then. Now don't you worry about wearing me out. I'm gonna wear you out. Well? He wanted to know why I have such a bad attitude. Did he kick you out? No. He put me on pots and pans for the rest of the semester. Could be worse. Yeah, he could have smashed my kneecaps with a ball-peen hammer. God, that fucker. That asshole! Get up. Get up! We gotta strike back. We have to do something epic tonight... or else I'm gonna look like a douche bag to the entire school. Come on. You were born looking like a douche bag, Billy. Come on, Joey. Get dressed! I don't want to, man. I want to go to sleep. I wanna dream about Jennifer. Later. It was fucking humiliating, man. - Okay. - (RHYTHMIC CLANGING) See, they're up for it. - You know me, man. I'm always up for it. - Good. What am I up for tonight? I don't know. I'm thinking about it. - Fire hoses. - That's been done. Cherry bombs in the toilets. It's too destructive. I mean, that would let the Dean know that he got under our skin. No, it's gotta be cooler than that. It's gotta be something witty, something elegant. Why don't you think about it while I take a nap? I got it. I got it. Come on. You'll love this. (BELL TOLLING) - (KNOCKING) - Come in. Sir, Dr. Gould would like to see you right away in the quad. (ALL SHOUTING, HOOTING) (CROWD QUIETS) BOY: Check it out. It's the Headmaster's furniture. Try not to laugh. I'm trying. I mean, just look at this. The blotter, the pen, the teacup on my desk. Everything just as I left it last night. You know what I'd really like to do? That's to work out here all day. I don't suppose that would be too good for discipline, would it? - I'm afraid not. - Yes. - Any idea who did it? - Very good idea. Well, don't be too hard on them. It's much better than... fire hoses in the chapel or cherry bombs in the toilet. (STIFLED LAUGH) (SIGHS) - You! - BOY: Yo, Billy! And you. And you two. You gentlemen have the honor of returning this furniture back to its original place. Pick up that banana. CROWD: Whoa! Are there any objections? - No, sir. - No, sir. (MUSIC) Yeah, sounds cool. - Hey, taste test. - Well? - Hi. Can I help you? - How you doin'? We don't want to hurt anybody. Get in the truck. (MACHINE GUN FIRE) - (SCREAMING) - MAN: Get down! MAN: Stay on the floor where you are until we tell you to move. Don't get up. Don't do anything. Is that clear? Hey! Stop! No! Don't hurt him! (GRUNTS) (GROANING) (SPEAKS SPANISH) They're looking for Donoghue. You can threaten me as much as you like. The fact remains that officers from the United States Marshal's Service... took young Donoghue out of school yesterday, and they did not say where they were taking him. I have been under a lot of strain lately, and I don't have a lot of patience. If you're lying and he's here, I will find him... and I'll kill you. He's not here. According to this, you're telling the truth. If you continue to do that, you have nothing to fear from me. These young men have done nothing to you. I realize that. How could this happen? We pay a fortune for this kind of information! We were in transit. They couldn't get to us. But we might not have a problem. I think you better take a look at these. LUIS: Anderson, Robert. - Anderson, Robert! - Here. Your father is president of the Tex-peet oil company. Yes, sir. Bradberry, Jonathan. Your father is Stephen Bradberry? Chairman of the First Empire Bank of New York? Yes. And Vice Chairman of The Republican Party? Yes. - Giles, Henry the Third. - Yes. Come here, Giles. Your father is Representative Henry Giles Jr.? Yes. Chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Yes, sir. Trotta, Joseph. Your father is Albert Trotta of New York City. Yes. The Albert Trotta? What's the matter? Not proud of your father. No. - Montoya, Ricardo. - Yes, sir. Your father is senior partner at Johnson, Montoya and Epps? Yes, sir. And past president of the California Bar Association. Yes, sir. So tell me, Ricardo. Are you a Mexican? Mexican-American. Do you speak Spanish? No, not really. - (SPEAKS SPANISH) Put a bullet in him. - No, wait! "Wait" what? You don't speak Spanish. I'm sorry. I do speak a little Spanish. Hey, don't! Hey, don't do that! Come on, man. - Is he a friend of yours? - Yes, he is. Well tell your friend he's lucky I didn't shoot him. What's your name? - William Tepper. - William Tepper. What does your father do, William? He's a contractor. According to this, he owns the third largest construction company in the world. Yeah, he's a contractor. You're not afraid? Hmm? - Yes, I'm afraid. - Good. Don't fuck with me. (SIGHS) You're right, Jack. We don't need Donoghue. We can play with this. I want the slick little bastard that spray painted my car! Otherwise, I'm gonna start arresting any of them damn rejects... that even show their face in this town! - I don't think so. Take a look at this. - Mouthwash. No. It's vodka. - One-hundred proof vodka. - So? So you got an Uncle that owns that liquor store down the street. - Now you wait just a damn minute. - You wait just a damn minute, Sheriff. We're gonna make ourselves a little deal here. You're gonna forget about who spray painted your car, and I'm gonna forget... - Listen if you think... - Sheriff! Somebody's been shot at the Regis school! - Come on, Dean. - (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (SIREN WAILING) (MAN ON RADIO, INDISTINCT) It's Frank Ingram. - What's going on up at the school? - We don't know. We get fired on if we try to get past the gate. Alright, you two, you get your shotguns, get down in the back seat of my car and stay out of sight. Hey, hey, you don't want to do that. You want to call the state police or the F.B.I. or something. Don't tell me what to do. I'll call them myself. (ON BULLHORN) Now hear this up at the school. This is the King's County Sheriff. Hold your fire. I'm coming up to talk to you. I'm alone and unarmed. Hold your fire. Hold your fire! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Shoot at the engine. Prevent them from coming closer. (RAPID GUNFIRE) (CAR HORN BLARES) (HORN BLARING CONTINUES) (SPANISH) Prepare the antitank. (SHOUTS IN SPANISH) Fire! (EXPLODING DEBRIS) Sheriff, Deputy Assistant Director Otis Brown. How you doin'? Sheriff has agreed to our assuming jurisdiction. I've been briefed on the plane. What's your assessment? Sir, there's an unknown number of terrorists... with .50-caliber machine guns and antitank rockets. There's about three miles of perimeter around the campus and their weapons can sweep the whole area. We've got to get assistance from the military. I'll try to get it. No communication from the school at all? None. (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPANISH CONTINUES) Your father's well? LUIS: He's tired of being in prison. He's ready to go home. (ADVENTUROUS MUSIC) I'm glad you could get here so quickly, Ed. My pleasure, Otis. I have troops taking up observation positions around the perimeter of the school and an assault force at a staging area five minutes away. Now, my orders are to assist you with observation and surveillance... and plan a joint assault with your people. That's it, Otis. Anything else would require specific orders from the President. I understand. Let's hope we never need to ask. Is it armed? It is now. Oh, man! This is disgusting. They expect us to eat this? This is dog vomit. The school gets taken over by terrorists, and I'm still on pots and pans. Stop now. Please come outside. LUIS: Anyone who leaves this building will be shot. We will take a head count now and again in the morning. If one person is missing... five of you will be executed. If two are missing, ten will be shot. And so on. Tomorrow we will begin a head count every hour... on the hour. If all goes well, you will be allowed out into the quad. But every hour on the hour, you must be in this room to be counted. Is that understood? Second. You have seen these orange wires running throughout this building and outside. These are wired to explosives. If any one of these wires is cut, the explosives will go off automatically. If any of the individual explosives are tampered with, they will explode! So... Don't touch the wires. Don't touch the explosives. Ninety-two. - (SHOUTING IN SPANISH) Over there! Stop! - All right, all right. - Just do as they say. - Are you okay? Are you all right? What are you doing? Ow. Man, stop. (MURMURING CONTINUES) Well, we managed to stay together anyway. Yeah, that's my ambition in life... to die with you guys. You're the kid they call Yogurt, right? This is your room? I'm Derek, and he's Ted, and yes, this is our room. Not anymore. Ah, here we go. - DEREK: Hey, put that down! - I guess some things never change. You have any sleeping bags, any blankets? No. Do you got any food around here, any candy bars, anything? - Do you have any more magazines? - No! - This your plane, Yogurt? - Yeah, I made it. You understand all this remote control stuff? Yes, I do. The thing the leader's got wrapped around his wrist? You think it'll work? - Yeah. - We're well and truly fucked. I mean they can't rescue us. We'd all get killed. - Then they'll pay the ransom. - Maybe. We're gonna do something, right? (SCOFFS) We can't just sit by and let these bastards fuck with our lives. - Do we have a choice? - Yes. Um, guys? Could we change the subject? I'd like to go to bed without wetting my pants. This is F.B.I. Deputy Assistant Director Otis Brown. Who am I speaking to? (ON PHONE) This is Dr. Robert Gould, the Head... Headmaster. Look, all the boys are here. They're all alive and in good health. They're frightened, of course. - Tell them about the explosives. - What? Explosives. Oh, yes. There are explosives all over the campus. He says that if the wires are cut, they'll blow up. And he has a remote control device... attached by tape to the back of his hand. He says he can blow the school up by pressing a button. It is true. And I will not hesitate. If you attack the school, my men will begin shooting students until you stop. But if by some miracle, you kill all of my men, whatever happens, I will still have time to press the button... and every one of us will die. I am releasing the faculty. One of them will be carrying a complete list of my demands. These are non-negotiable. If you do not produce my father unharmed, I will begin executing the hostages. I'm sure by now you have discovered who these students are... and who their parents are. "Rejects." I assume the students did this. Yes. Over half the student body consists of boys that have been expelled from other prep schools. - Hence the nickname. - I see. No, you don't see. My boys, many of them have a real problem with authority. There's no telling what they might do in a situation like this. That could damn well get 'em killed. Exactly. There's one boy in particular. GENERAL KRAMER: Here they come. It's a body. DEAN: I think it's Jesse Miller, the chemistry teacher. Do you think it's true... about the explosives? Would he be willing to blow himself up along with everyone else? BROWN: I think he'd be willing to do anything if he doesn't get his father back. Anything. BILLY: Can't sleep, huh? Nope. Yeah, me neither. None of us can sleep, especially with you two yapping. Billy, we gotta do something. Yeah, we can be cool and wait to be rescued. BILLY: Anybody know morse code? With that light and a mirror, we could send signals back and forth. No, Billy! Nobody knows morse code. For Christ's sakes. SNUFFY: Well, we got the perfect number for poker. Anybody got a deck of cards? - You can't smoke in the dorms. - (CHUCKLING) What are they gonna do, kick me out? Shut up, you guys. (SHOUTS IN SPANISH) Shut the door, go to sleep! Hey, Joey, shut the door. Shut the door. There's one of them at the end of the hall. Yeah? So we make some noise and we get him in here. And then we jump him. Then what? Billy, he's got a fuckin' machine gun. With a fucking machine gun... - we could shred these fuckers! - Hey. Joey. You know, this machine gun stuff must run in mafia families. - You son of a bitch! - Joey! Ow! Joey! - Come on, get up. - That was a joke, okay? I'm your friend. I can call you a fucking wop if I want to. Quiet. - They're crazy. - BILLY: Kiss and make up. I'm sorry, man. Just don't call me a wop, all right? Sure. Is it okay if I call you an asshole? Sure. Asshole, dickhead. Whatever. Fuck face. All right, enough of this machine gun stuff, Joey. Oh, okay, mom. You think of a better idea. - You wanna know what we should do? - ALL: No. We need to find out everything about these guys who are holding us. How many of them there are, what kind of guns they have, all that stuff. Then we need to get that information to the outside world. Then they can get in and rescue us. I think it's a very cool idea. Let's do it. That sounds like a lot of effort for a group of underachievers. And the difference is, if the Dean catches you, he doesn't kill you. - Look, are you with me or not? - Why even... of course we're with you, man. But if you get us shot, we're gonna be pissed. Parents of the hostages being held at the Regis school have been arriving all day and are being urged by F.B.I. Officials to stay at a local motel. We'll try and talk with some of the parents. Excuse me. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) BOY 1: Jerry, come on, man. This way. BOY 2: Hey, bring that back. Now this, gentlemen, this object I'm holding here is called... well, some of you may have seen one of these before. It's called a book. You may have seen one on television. Fellas, it's over here, the ball's over here. Thank you very much. Don't pay any attention to them. Sooner or later, they'll all be gone. Oh, yes, but this book... will be important... forever. Guard. Hey, Gube. Heard you brought a breakfast tray up to the lookouts in west hall. - Yeah. - What room were they in? - They were in the infirmary. - How many? - Two. - What kind of stuff do they have? What do you mean? What stuff? - Guns, grenades. That kind of stuff. - Man, they had tons of it. All kinds. A big machine gun. Wait a minute. I'm not gonna get in trouble for this, am I? Don't be a wuss, Gube. Describe the machine gun. Why don't you send your troops in there and shoot the sons of bitches?! You are crazy. Just shut up. Did you realize that the head of the New Jersey mafia... is here in this room? I see him. Knowing that, you let him send his son to your school? Of course. It's not the boy's fault who his father is. The F.B.I. advises parents to pay the ransom. So why don't you just give the guy what he wants? In the first place, the F.B.I. has no such policy. But beyond that, your sons haven't been kidnapped. They're being held hostage by a gang of terrorists. As we know, it's United States policy... not to accede to terrorist demands. Well that policy is gonna have to change! We'll go to the White House if we have to! My family isn't rich. We don't have influence at the White House. My son is on a full scholarship to the school. So is mine. We should talk to the press. Why should our kids suffer alongside the rich kids? Nobody should go to the White House. Certainly nobody should talk to the press. Now look, I know how much of a strain this is, but you could be putting your sons in even greater danger. So please... please let the experts handle this. (BELL TOLLING) JACK: 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92. Back outside now, please. WOMAN ON TV: Beyond saying there is an adequate number, I'm not prepared to comment. MAN: Are the hostages safe at this time? The hostages are obviously in a very dangerous situation... and will be so until they are released. Everybody's accounted for. MAN: Are negotiations in progress now with the terrorists? WOMAN: This administration has never waivered from the policy that the United States must never give in to the demands of terrorists. To do so would only encourage more hostage taking. Well, we'll see. (STUDENTS CHATTERING) - Hey, man, I'm supposed to... - We know. - Be careful, man. - You bet. I'm supposed to take this to your guys upstairs. (HAWKING) Lunch. Enjoy. (COUGHING) We got two guards in the bell tower, two more in the attic of Fisher Hall. There's two in the infirmary and two more on the roof of West Hall. That's eight. Okay, three in the quad makes 11, and the leader in the office is 12. His name is Luis Cali. And the three guys in the quad... that's Jorge, Ruiz and Carlos. That's right. You do speak a little Spanish. Don't forget the American guy with the glasses. BILLY: That makes 13. This man, here. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) - You know Vinny? - Vinny. The F.B.I.'s crawling all over me. I didn't even wanna use a pay phone. - You seen the news? - Yeah, of course. This Enrique Cali... the old man who's in prison. Now he's been around. We've done business with him. I know the Bars brothers are in with him very big. So is Dino Frenetti and his boy Micky. All right. I want you to reach out to them fast. Tell them to get to the old man and explain about my son. All right. It's done, right away. The kid hates me. Albert, hey, hey. Kids are kids. They go through, uh, a stage. They're ashamed of us. Hey, it's just a phase. No, it's different with Joey. He really hates me. But what can I do? I love him... and I want him out of there. - It's done. Right away, okay? - Go ahead. SNUFFY: Billy, we've got enough to do without you thinking up more ideas. BILLY: Excuse me, I'm having a private conversation with Yogurt. Billy! So Yogurt... this is the chip that sends the radio signals to the plane? YOGURT: Right. And it's the same kind of chip that he's got in the garage door opener thing wrapped around his wrist, the one that controls the explosives? Well, it should be. I mean, all chips aren't standardized. Well then if we could somehow switch these chips, then we would control the bombs with this and he would just control the plane with his wrist deal. - Right. - Don't be ridiculous. First of all, the guy's got the remote control tied around his wrist all the time. - How you gonna get it? - I think he has a point. No, he could be knocked out. There's no way that anybody could knock him out without giving him time to press the button. And his men would just shoot you if you did. BILLY: Maybe. HANK: Even if you could get it, why switch the chips? You can just take the thing and flush it down the toilet. We're getting the information out. I guess we're doing all we can do. What do you think of this? BILLY: Is it legible? Only if you know how to read. I told you the searchlight would be important. That's great, Joey. "If you know how to read." Of course, the reverse is also true. What the hell do you mean, "The reverse is also true"? What I mean is if you take the other chip... the receiving chip out of the plane, then you can replace it with the receiving chip from the detonator. Oh, yeah, that's wonderful. Now all we have to do is get Cali out of the Headmaster's office, which he hardly ever leaves, sneak past the guard, switch the chips without setting off the bombs... and then get out without being seen. That's right. That's it exactly. I was attempting to be sarcastic. Well you shouldn't have been. You should have been writing it down. Stop it, Billy. You're beginning to scare me. 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92. Take 'em out. You may go outside now. I'd like to see the sophomore class by the bench, please. BOY: Reggie. Over here, man. Come on. You got till exactly 45 minutes past the hour to get back to the trees. - That's the big hand on the little nine. - I'll be there. - Wait until they look the other way. - Okay. - Ready? - Ready. - Watch yourself, man. - BOY: Kick the ball! (BOYS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) BOY: All right. Roosevelt represented a profoundly different view... of the role of the federal government. - Start it up. - All right. Looks good to me. - (ENGINE REVVING) - All right, pick it up. Get it ready. Let her go. A view that, uh, troubled the government... in economic life... - You really can fly it, huh, Derek? - (ENGINE REVVING) Oh, sh... - Oh. - Oh, shit. - Oh, dear. - (ALL GASPING) Hey, you... (ADVENTUROUS MUSIC) Be on the alert. Shut it down now. (SPANISH) Jorge, give it to me. BOY: Man, come on! Hands on your head! Oh, great. Look. I'm from the school. Here's all the information you need about the people who are holding us. Be careful with it. We're all fine so far. - Nice outfit. I gotta run. - You gotta wait for the boss. I gotta get back before somebody knows I'm gone! Look, I'm on a schedule here! Look kid, I'm sorry, but you're not going anywhere until we check you out. You have a student named Tepper? Yes. Billy Tepper. I've been waiting for something from him. - Just keep him there. - What's he done? There's a helicopter on the pad outside. If he is one of your boys, go get him and bring him back here. Roosevelt, by using the radio, was able to speak to the American people... (HEADMASTER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (SPANISH) This is coffee. Even if you are who you say you are, we cannot let you go back. They'd kill you. That's my problem. I can make it. I've gotta go right now. - Billy. - You gotta get me out of here, sir. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. I'm fine. - You know this kid? - Yes, of course. They're gonna shoot five kids if I don't go back. They're gonna shoot you if you do go back. I can make it. You know I can't lie to you. You gotta know I'm telling you the truth. I believe you. Let him go. I cannot accept that responsibility. DEAN: Let him go. Get him! Stop the kid before he gets himself killed. Any second now. (BEEPING) - (BEEPING STOPS) - (SPANISH) Where the hell is he? He'll be here. He'll be here. Oh, geez! He's got a minute. Oh, shit! - (BELL CHIMING) - Please, God. (MAN OVER RADIO, INDISTINCT) Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. - What do we do? - Well can we wait? Damn! It's already too late, man. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) JACK: 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86... get back in line! I already counted you. 87, 88, 89, 90, 91. - It's still 91. - Count them again. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (SPANISH) Two helicopters are coming towards us. Okay. (SPANISH) Open fire and prevent them from getting closer. JACK: One, two, three, four, five... 86, 87, 88... 89, 90, 91. (WHISPERING) We got one boy missing. I told you what would happen if one of you escaped. (SHOUTING) Did you think I was kidding? You first. Let's go. Face against the wall. Come on. You too. You! (SHOUTING) You! Get over there! And you. Run. - Run. - (DOOR OPENS) Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. I was in the shower. I didn't hear the bell ring. He's wet. - I'm sorry. - So he is. - Come with me. Come with me. - I'm sorry. Okay, let's go. Get back in line. It's all over. Come on! Go! Okay, let's go. Come on. Come on. Go. My father sent me to a school that looked a lot like this one. A military academy in Pennsylvania. Perhaps you've heard of it... the Armitage School? Uh, yeah, I think so. You really have no sense of discipline, do you? Look, I'm sorry about the shower thing. I promise... Oh, shit. - This is how they taught me discipline, - Oh, shit. - And believe you me, - (GRUNTS) - I learned. - (GROANING) This basement the kid is talking about, it's not on the plans. It exists. I've been in it. There used to be a building right here behind where the kitchen is. That's a subbasement in that building. There's no building directly above it then. That's right. So if the hostages were in the basement... and the buildings blew up, they'd probably survive. That building was built in 1881. They built to last back in those days. What about the explosives? Well, it's interesting what the kid says about switching the chips in the remote control receiver. - Could it work? - It's very possible. I wouldn't wanna take the responsibility for letting the kid try this, but... it could work. Take it easy... It's over. Washington has authorized me to make a deal. KRAMER: What are we giving them? Whatever it takes to get the hostages free. We have a shot at a successful assault here. We know the location of every terrorist. The kid can get the other students out of the line of fire. What kid? This kid has been kicked out of two schools. - No, three schools. - Three schools. Come on. All of this is unreliable. Well, that's not really true. I may not rely on Billy getting to class on time, but I would rely on this. - Why? - Because he's got guts. He's a leader. You can see that he's, uh, thought this thing through. Now, if Billy says he can do it... I gotta believe he can. If everything goes perfect... could we guarantee no casualties among the hostages? Guarantee? No, of course not. Then our orders are to cut a deal. That's unacceptable. The demands in my letter must be followed exactly. I'll have to go back to my superiors. - We'll need... time to discuss this. - I understand. In recognition of your willingness to negotiate, the execution scheduled for 5:00 P.M. today will be postponed. However... if we have not concluded a deal by 5:00 P.M. tomorrow, there will be no further delays. We won. (PRISONERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) We just got a message from Albert Trotta. Trotta's kid, Joey, goes to the Regis school. He naturally wants him out. And he'd be a good guy to have owe us a favor. Give me something to write with. Give this message to my son. They're receiving another message. (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH OVER RADIO) (MAN OVER RADIO STOPS) - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - It's the Headmaster. How you feeling? Okay. Come to my office, will you, Mr. Trotta? - They want to see you. - Why? I don't think they mean you any harm. I'll go with you. - It's all right. - Okay. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (PATS DESK) We're letting you go. - What? - You're free to go. These men will take you to the main entrance. All you have to do is walk down the driveway. Why me? Because we respect your father. Fuck my father... and fuck you! I'm not going anywhere without my friends. Oh, yes, you are. Don't fight him! Just go! Ow! Oh! - (GUARD SPEAKS SPANISH) - Let go of me! (BOTH SHOUTING) Okay, okay, all right. I'm going. I'm going. Joey! No! Joey! Let me go! (MUFFLED SHOUTING) - Jorge! (SPANISH) - BILLY: Let me go! Joey! Joey! Oh, you fucker! - You son of a bitch! - Okay! (SPANISH) Bring him inside! Get in the room! Inside, let's go. (SPANISH) Please wait there. It is very important that you explain to them... that we did not want to kill this boy. We were releasing him, in fact. But he suddenly attacked my men and they were forced to shoot him. I would like to see the Headmaster and the other students, please. Not possible. Then release the Headmaster and take me instead. No. It is very important that you tell them... we did not intend to kill this boy. It was an accident. It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't come here in the first place! It wouldn't have happened if the American government hadn't kidnapped my father! Now, we will leave as soon as my father is returned to me. You tell them that. You tell them that this one was an accident, but the next one won't be. They're gonna hunt you down, you know that, don't you? They'll eventually find you, and then they will kill you. You Americans always say that... but you never actually do it. God, I am sorry. It's a lie... this stuff about an accident. - I don't believe it. - Well, it's what they claim. How does a kid have an accident that gets him shot with a machine gun? I don't know. These people are grown-ups, not like my son. It's time they found out there's no such thing as an accident. (SNIFFLING) (PRISONERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (CELL RELEASE ALARM BUZZING) (SHOUTING CONTINUES) (SHOUTING STOPS) BROWN: The President has waived Posse Comitatus, and we have orders to proceed with the assault as planned. Our assault teams are to move out to the helicopters and stand by, Sargent Major. BROWN: Cut the power to the campus and jam everything... radio, TV, microwave. - I want an absolute and total blackout. - What's going on? Yesterday your boy Billy Tepper suddenly appeared on our side of the wire. How'd he do that? There's an old storm drain on the east edge of the campus right there. It's got bars on it, but the boys always manage to get through. - What's happening? - Could you show our explosives expert how to get through that drain? Of course. What's happening? Enrique Cali was just murdered in prison. As soon as Luis Cali finds out about his father's death, he'll start killing hostages. He could very well blow up the school. We've got no choice. We have to go in. KRAMER: Now we're doing everything we can, but I gotta tell you, the casualties could be high unless your boy does what he says he can do. - DEAN: He'll try. - He better. - Billy, wake up. - I'm awake. That's the signal. They're going to attack and they want our help. They're crazy. What the hell do they think we can do? We'll get everybody killed. - This was your idea. - It's too late to back out now. No, it isn't. They're depending on us to do what we said! Well, they'll stop depending on us when we don't answer. You asshole! Give me that! Get off me! Maybe it was a mistake to follow your plan, but we did because you wanted us to. Now it's too late to back out. We can't back out and neither can you. I've been a major fuckup my whole life. I'll get you all killed. Come on, man. I'm sorry. The cuts on your back. Forget about the cuts on my back. God, that's the least of our problems right now. Your plan is just as good now as it was yesterday when we thought it was great. - We were wrong yesterday. - No, stop this, Billy! You got us into it. You gotta get us out. If you say, "we have to do it for Joey," I'm gonna fucking puke. We don't have to tell you why. You know why. You're fucking morons. You know that, don't you? You're fucking morons. That's why we hang with you, Billy. - We're really gonna do this? - You bet. All right, we got a lot of work to do, especially you. Me? (SWITCH CLICKING) Are you there? What are you trying to do? You see, there's been a power failure affecting the whole county. - They're working on it. - I see. Well you have exactly one hour to fix the power. Then I kill one hostage every 15 minutes until it's back on. (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) All right now, just relax. Try and act casual. The next guy comes out of the bathroom, you two go, all right? When you come out of the storm drain, if you stay to the right as you go up the hill, you'll be under cover until you get to this point right here. You know, it would be a lot easier if I went along with you. I'm sorry, sir. We can't let you do that. We'll be fine with the map. Hey, you guys all set? If there's any problem, just turn off the water. - Okay. - Come on. You sure this goes to the Headmaster's office? How do you think I broke in to get the Headmaster's furniture out? How do you think I got the algebra final? Geez Louise, Yogurt, you'd think we were going to defuse a bomb or something. - (SIGHS) - It was a joke, Yogurt. Lighten up. (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) (WHEEZING, GAGGING) Hey, man, are you okay? Get his medicine! Come on, quick. Out of the way. (WHEEZING CONTINUES) - (GUARD, LUIS SPEAKING SPANISH) Boss! - What do you want? One of the students has a problem, you should come. I don't know, he can't breath. All right, now what? - Alright, you see that box? - Yeah. No, no, no! That's the detonator. Don't touch that box. It's the other box... the blue box. The one with the light on it. That's the remote control receiver. Take the casing off. Do any of your men have medical training? This boy's very sick. (INHALING) All right, what now? All right, all right, very, very carefully... take the red chip out of the receiver. Okay. - There is no red chip. - There must be. Well, I'm sorry, there isn't. There's a blue chip the same size as the red chip, but there's no red chip. That must be it then. Well, is it or isn't it? I don't know. This boy has a history of medical problems. You can see how sick he is. You must call an ambulance. (WHEEZING CONTINUES) (WHEEZING, GASPING) Okay, it should just slide in now. (INHALING) (SIGHS) - (DOOR LATCH OPENING) - Oh, shit! Watch out. I'm coming up. Damn it. I can't just wait here. SOLDIER: Prepare to engage targets. Confirm target acquisition. - Targets are up. - Fire. He's got a history of asthma. (SIGHS) Oh. - I'm feeling a little better, sir. - Good, good. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) - BOY: What was that? - (SPANISH) What was that? Hello! Hello! (GASPS) (SPANISH) Hello! Hello! Hello! It's not gonna work. They jammed the radios. Okay, Jack. (SPANISH) Go take a look! (GRUNTING) Shh. Listen. Do you hear water running? Yes. Oh, good. I thought we were in trouble. Move. There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it? I got him. I got him. I got him! Hit him, Yogurt! Come on, Yogurt. Hit him! Oh, forget it. We're jamming the radios. Help me get to the Headmaster's office... to the detonator... Let's go. Are you supposed to be here? Yeah, I'm on pots and pans. "Pozanpans"? What is "Pozanpans"? No, pots and pans. When they wanna give a kid a really terrible job for punishment, they give him pots and pans. I have to wash this shit after every meal. - Pots and pans. - Yeah, pots and pans. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (SPANISH) Did you hear that? (SPANISH) Take that! Come with me! Come on! Let's go! Everybody in the kitchen! - Everybody in the kitchen! - Move, move! Come on, come on! Move! Move, move, move, move! Go. Hurry it up! Come on, get in. (GUNFIRE) (SPANISH) Stay outside! - (BOYS CHATTERING) - Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Ruiz! Jorge! (GASPS) Jorge? Get up! (GUNFIRE) (GRUNTS) SOLDIER: Hold your fire. He's got a hostage! (SPANISH) No one is allowed in here! Wait. - Oh, God. - (SPANISH) Careful, Lukas! - (SHOUTS) - I'm sorry. (BANGING AT DOOR) BILLY: Don't. - What'll happen if he pulls out the wires? - The bombs will go off. Shoot him. (DOOR EXPLODING INWARD) (SCREAMING) BILLY: Are you all right? Yeah. I'm sorry I was such an asshole to you. I mean, now that you saved my life and everything. Oh, it's okay. I never took it personally. Good. Hey, congratulations. You came through. You just might graduate in this lifetime. Does that mean I'm off pots and pans? Oh, no. You don't think you're gonna get off that easy, do you? Huh? (LAUGHING) (BOYS LAUGHING, CHATTERING) Hey, have you guys seen Billy? Hey, have you seen Billy? - Where can he be? - Hey! Hey! Here's an ambulance. (SIREN WAILS) Is Billy Tepper in there? He's not in there. SNUFFY: No one's seen Billy? - Where is he, man? - BILLY: Hey! Hey! Billy! - (LAUGHING) - How ya doin'? Hey, guys. Hey, Derek.
