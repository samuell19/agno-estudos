Subtitles by DramaFever Ms. Kim Hang Ah is returning to the North today. Please prepare for it. Why would Jae Ha...? Where is he now? He went to the ceremony right after talking to us. Mom, you should go see Hang Ah at least. No, I'll go. The Chief Secretary has already gone, but I think it will be hard. The North has already ordered for her return. I tried to stay despite the North's orders, but... He said no. He never wanted you to attend the public trial, but I asked you anyway. I'm sorry. Why? I'll ask you one thing. -Do you...? -Of course, I love the king. But... I'm not talking about a shallow emotion like love. You will rise to be this nation's queen. Are you ready for it? I was against this marriage from the beginning, and I still am. But if you are willing, I will help you. I will turn the king's heart and political situations in your favor. Do you think you are ready? I'm just an average woman. I just want to meet someone that loves me and live comfortably. I'm still scared of the South Koreans. This place is scary as well as all the people... And now, even the king... I will contact the North. Are you breaking off your engagement? I never had an engagement. But this seems like we're listening to their orders. It won't look good for us. Why don't we deport her instead? There's something I said to Comrade Lee Jae Ha when we were in Jeju Island. Nothing in this world is impossible for people to do. If we have the heart, everything is possible. I realize I was wrong. I was over-confident. It's because people are involved. It can't be perfect. Come back to us. When the South-North relations improve, please come back. Sorry. Did Hang Ah leave safely? Are you in your right mind? Why did you do it? Why? You were right. You should never trust anyone too easily. Did she betray your trust? I'm going to rest. Did you know your father used to wet his bed until he was well over 40? He suffered an illness. I secretly took care of him. One time I called him a bed-wetter jokingly, and he got very upset. He told me to get botox shots because he couldn't stand to see my wrinkly face. He said this was why he should never have let a commoner into the royal family. Mom, this is different... People are like that. We can be very childish. If we start looking for places to pick fights... Weakness? Secret? We use those to attack the other. At the end, we don't even remember what we're fighting over. We just focus on how we can maximize the other's pain. That's all we end up thinking about. But still, your father and I never mentioned separating or breaking up. Why? Because that's the end. That's a line you should never cross. Who said it first? Was it Hang Ah? Then I can't forgive her either. To you, that may be crossing the line, but to me... Was it you? You're pathetic. You really are trash. Is that really why you're so upset? The whole world knows you're trash. You kicked her out because you told her it was a secret, and that word bounced back at you? Oh... Trash, trash... Even the stinkiest of the trash is better than you. Mom, how can you... Can't you understand why I'm saying this? And what about her? A girl who stuck up for you at the trial, for her to call you trash... What did she say? Didn't you watch the trial? What do you think about all the North's late actions? There are problems with human rights in North Korea... Oh, you have to go back. But first... You have to leave all of the palace's belongings behind. It could cause problems later. Sorry. Let me ask you simply. Where's your identity as of now? The North or the South? -We're fighting often these days. -Who? With the king? About South-North conflicts? He was like that from the beginning. He told me I wasn't even a woman. That he shouldn't have hoped so highly. I was angry about his words, so I acted even more rigid and rough. But when I think about it now, I think that's when we started to like each other. Using the South's expressions, I think you can say I'm into bad boys. It's the same now. The king and I are not that close. We argue and tease each other. But to me, his heart seems deeper that way. I feel I can read his heart a bit. And I look forward to hearing what he'll say to me next. My heart beats thinking about him. Of course at times, I feel let down. And sometimes, I get angry thinking that I like him more. But in the end, that doesn't matter. I'm happy just knowing that he's with me. Identity? Are you asking about my identity? I'm just a woman with one man deeply rooted in my heart. Hamburger. Spicy seafood. Fried pupa. Seasoned meat. Don Katsu. Comrade Lee Jae Ha Comrade, comrade. Comrade Lee Jae Ha. Get rid of him. I can't stand it. Strong reactions... You must be feeling guilty. Tell me everything that Jae Kang liked. I heard you took it out on the secretary. You kicked her out because she called you trash. Why are you so emotional? Compared to Hang Ah, you're so childish... I know... I'm trash. -So, leave. -You should find the right solution. Use your temper for the right reasons. If you made a mess, you should do something to fix it. What can I do now?! I know. My temper ruined everything. Even as I was going to the ceremony, I was hoping someone would stop me. They sent her back so quickly as if they had been waiting all along. I want to put the blame elsewhere, but I know it was my fault. But so what? -You're the king. -King my butt. They have no respect for me. I asked to make a public announcement that the North had nothing to do with the assassin. They treat me like a barking dog. The king of this nation has no power. Even if I brought her back, everyone would be against it. Nothing would change. If I don't want to repeat all this, I need to get to the bottom. That's why I need to find who killed Jae Kang. This is first. When will you do all that? You're going to look for Hang Ah when she's a grandmother? Married Life. Residence. The Catcher in the Rye. Adultery? Ceiling pattern. Pretty wallpaper. Light bulbs. Jae Kang, give me a hint. Please? Can't you help me out? -You should get ready. -What is this a show? They thought this out carefully. The more unease there is in the nation, the more we need to unite. There's nothing better than sports to unite the nation. The National Anthem will be playing. Please sit closer. In the back, straighten out your backs. Let's practice. Our player scores a goal! Our player's ball hit the goal post, and just missed the goal. Your highness... You have to act a bit more disappointed. Imagine this... Player Park is running towards the goal... running, running...past one opponent...towards the goal... That's right. Good, good. Kick it up. Kick it up. Up, up. That's it. That's it! There it is! Shoot, shoot.... Awwww! You idiot, all you have to do is put your foot there. Any fool can put that in. -It's okay, we can still win. -It's not okay. There's only 5 minutes left. If he didn't think he could do it, he should've at least gotten out a penalty kick. Enough. Enough. Turn it off, off. It's fine. We still have time! Go South Korea! South Korea! The national anthem has just finished playing. Go South Korea. Go South Korea. Clapping, too? So geeky. Where do I talk? Ummm.... I didn't know this day... ummm...would come so soon. I'll do my best, father! Father, I finally.... got to join the WOC today. Aren't you proud of me? All the South and North Korean soldiers will gather... I wish you could see it. It'll be hard, right? We really fought hard for this, but it all came to an end with just training... What's wrong with Jae Ha? He's a prince. He should be a good role model. How can he put his own team to fight each other? Father, Jae Ha did it! He did 60km in 8 hours! I'm so proud of him. Now, all I have to do is marry him off. They're candidates. Who do you like better? She's a famous fashion designer. And she's the military doctor's daughter. I hear she's very smart. This is the one that I like the most. She's from the Special Forces Unit. It will be hard, right? The public, but Club M as well... I told you about what happened in China, right? Remember when you told me I shouldn't bother associating with someone who doesn't even exhibit the minimum amount of common sense? But, what happens when someone like that is blocking me from doing what I need to do? He planted a bomb. A corporation is getting in the way of the nation. Club M is responsible for planting the bomb inside the treadmills during the WOC training. He pretends to be humble, but he's very sharp. He will do anything for personal gain. That's exactly it. He's giving you the money to build the memorial park there, so you can dig up the false evidence. There's an old saying... If you want to trust fully, you need to first start with suspicions. That North Korean girl you plan to marry... He has absolutely no principles or rules. He was teasing and threatening me at the same time. He said he's the King. He looked as if he would kill me. But I still shouldn't be scared, right? These materials from our country. Why do we use them? The ones from Israel are cheaper. -The function... -It says there's not much difference. The French didn't even promote it. They assumed we would choose this one. Why? Because it belongs to Club M? Six trillion Won to replace fighter planes. Wow...if a war starts, North Korea will be involved too. Talking about other nations' affairs... These materials are part of Club M, too? They're all connected, aren't they? Yes. IT, steel, telecommunication, nuclear power, even petroleum... They're rich. Club M must be a military-industrial complex. They fund politicians all over the world. Very impressive. They have a very big role in both politics and the military. Arthur Mayer... Kim Suh Gu... For a Korean, he's really done well... The one who inherited everything is that guy I met? Yes, he's John Mayer. Is there a possibility that he may have killed my brother? Yes, there is. - Call him in. - There are chances elsewhere as well. Do you think everyone supported the WOC as well as the South-North marriage? Even if you look around, there's not many nations that will be happy with North Korea's success. Circumstantial evidence is not enough for anything. How is John Mayer's personality? It's as you saw. 21st century Gollum. I can see that... Magician John... What is this? He likes showing off his magic tricks. He likes to show off... Do you remember? When we were kids... I foolishly... Through your clothes... Call him. - Your Highness... - I won't do anything I'll regret. We'll just talk. Lee Jae Ha wants to meet me? Yes, he wants to meet you as soon as possible. I guess he remembers me. He must have. Oh, I'm getting so excited. I must love him. Tell him I'll be there immediately. Get the best clothes ready. I told you to get a helicopter without the propeller. He's here. I'm going to listen in on your conversation. You know... If the Chief Secretary finds it imporant to take part... Go ahead. This way. This way, please. How've you been, Your Highness? Sorry for asking you to stop by when you must be so busy. No, I'd be here anytime you need me. I've heard some rumors. That Club M is responsible for the murder of the late king. That's not true, right? What? I was thinking about who would lose most from the WOC and the unification of North and South. There are numerous corporations that would lose out from these events. But when I looked closely, most of these companies belonged to Club M. By any chance... Do you run a military-industrial complex? No, I just... Right, all you have is a small resort. No, I wouldn't say it's small. Whatever... They're all similar. Please sit. I hear there's over 100 companies... How could a Korean...? How could a king look down upon his own country? I'm not looking down. It just doesn't make any sense. Unofficially, you rank top 10 among the world's wealthiest men. Unofficial... this is a word that they just put there. If there's nothing to hide, why can't it be offical? If this is how you count your wealth, then, I would be an unofficial Asian billionaire, too. Maya, 21st century Al Capone? People like novels.... What the heck is this? As a fellow Korean, let me give you a warning. Don't believe all this. I know some big-time businessmen. Supporting and cheering you on? That's all poison. Once you start to get big-headed and arrogant, all your money has already run out. Your properties start getting reposessed. This... That... You can lose your line of credit at a moment's notice. While you have something, make sure you stay humble, and be careful you have no money leaking out. That way... That's why... I took posession of An Myun Do. I took care of your brother's death, you fool. Are you glad? You happy I'm playing along? But you know what? I knew all along. Why? Because I'm great. Did you ever hear of Shadow Info? That's me. Quite different from you... You're a ruler in name only, ruling over a country the size of a finger nail. WOC? South-North Unification? Of course, they were in my way. But, that's not why I killed your brother. Your brother banned me from entering the country. How dare he... He died without a clue... Like a fool. Just drinking away... Feeling buzzed and happy... Are you on drugs? Bipolar disorder is very serious. I think you're doing this because I didn't remember you last time. Still, you shouldn't lie. Stop acting. Oh, you said you stabbed me? I don't remember you stabbing me, but I remember you wrote something. Something on the window... Foggy... -White fogs... -Right. You wrote with your finger. "I...am...Tom?" "I am Tom, you're Jane?" That's not it. It's John. Oh right, Bong Gu! Right? That's your Korean name? Bong Gu. Kim Bong Gu. Right, it was "I am Bong Gu." Right? You!! I will remember from now on, Mr. Kim Bong Gu. You should leave. -Yes. -If you go to the lobby, You'll see an idiot leaving. Get a hold of him immediately. -What? -Get him, and rip his head off now. Or rip his limbs off! Hey!!! You're all dead! You're dead! What is he saying? -Yes, father. -It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Don't do anything! Your Highness... You heard? He said with his own lips... That he killed him. Testify. You're the king. Did I say I'm not? The one that he killed was a king, too. Korea's king. You shouldn't go after personal revenge when the nation is already at unrest. So... You can't do it? Even when we have this evidence? We have nothing but this evidence. You always said that we have no power. You think they'll sit back and do nothing? All the businesses related to Club M will turn the economy upside down. Politicians worldwide will stand up against it. They're all getting funded by Club M. There will be articles written all over the place going against you. Why? Because they studied with scholarships funded by Club M. You think that's not reason enough? We, ourselves, received their donation. Of course, it was without knowing. There's no such thing as justice in the world. Only power. Money. So we can't do anything? There's a way. The WOC and South-North Unification is what caused Club M to detest the late king. In other words, that's how much Club M fears it. We should have North and South generals attend the WOC together, and establish good relations between the two nations through marriage. This is what they hate the most. And, it will be the best revenge we can get. - But the WOC is already... - It will be hard. South-North marriage? You broke it off yourself. I'm sorry to say, but I doubt if you will be able to get revenge. You've always been all talk, but you've done nothing right. When you're ready to accomplish the WOC as well as a South-North marriage, come and let me know. Before then, I haven't seen or heard anything today. What are you doing? What did you hear? What's Club M? How's the security for the royal family's confidential files? -What's the King's passcode? -MT521. Change the passcode please. -The late king... -Get out. -Is Club M responsible for it? -I said get out! -Is that guy from Club M...? -Chief Security Guard Lee Shi Kyung! Stop butting your head in. Act like a soldier and just follow the orders! You used to detest things like that. You said, "Why be a soldier that only follows orders?" "Be a judge that can make decisions on his own." You said you weren't capable. So you're looking down on the king because he's not capable? You and the king just have different ways... I've seen him since he was a first year in high school. I know him well. -I've lived with him. -He can't even control his own emotions. -He just does as he pleases. - He's different in urgent times. He's strong. -His real side comes out in dangerous moments. -Do you even know what real danger is? How old are you? Strong in danger? That's what he wants to believe as a king. You were always like that. Once you believe something, you never give it up. You are the same. Once you make up your mind against something, you never change. Jae Kang, am I really useless? I can't do it? What? You think I'm useless, too? So what? You're going to belittle me like your father did? Like father, like son? Don't be swayed by what others say. Believe in yourself. You are already very strong. What is this? Are you being sarcastic? As far as I know, you are very sensitive and don't like anything to be serious. But, you are very well aware of reality. You have too much pain that holds you back. That's why you wear a mask to hide your true self. I'm asking you to take the mask off. You have a lot of complexes, and a lot of people look down on you. But to me, you're the world's strongest king. Please stand tall and be bold. What's with him so suddenly? Is he crazy? Testimony Regarding King's Death I, Eun Gyu Tae, met with Daniel Craig, a businessman, on March 27th at Dae Han Hotel in Room 1501 around 1 in the afternoon. He donated one million pounds to the royal family. I recommended a vacation spot in South Korea. That place coincidentally... -Hello. -You idiot! That's all you can do?! -How did you get this number? -What the heck? I know your social security, license number, and house entrance code. If you took our bribe, you should have taken care of the business! As I said before, I never... What the heck is he talking about sincerity for? Fine, I'm sure there was 1% of your sincerity. Why? It's like they said, "Mixing 1% sincerity is more effective than 100% lie." You do know who I'm talking about, right? He was a Nazi. That's why you mixed your sincerity in. To make the king believe you, so he wouldn't suspect you. Even more, you wanted to believe yourself. If you keep talking about sincerity, you're fooling yourself. You're lying to yourself and to your conscience. You're defrauding yourself! You understand? That idiot hung up on me. Hey! Hey! He is useful to us. So you better treat him... That's why I told you to get someone totally rotten. What the heck is this? He's torn in the middle! This can't go on. Get Bong Bong. Now! Drink. Relax. Let's be friends. You're so by the rule. Club M... What should... First, find out everything you can. Even the smallest details. The code between us is "Bong Gu." "Bong Gu." Please try to understand my father. I know. He may be old, but he's genuine. Who would stay with the royal family for 30 years? When we're so powerless. Thank you. Hang Ah... What should I do? The king called? Don't you dare pick it up! How dare he call after treating my daughter that way. Did you enjoy the fireworks? Father. Don't worry about me. You should go spend more time together. We just went for a walk. And my stomach is hurting a bit. It must be menstrual cramps. I knew it was coming. It's not like you are an innocent teen. Why are you acting so shy? You don't know menstruation? Monthly period! In the words of the South, period! She's outspoken... You know girls these days... Let's go. It's hurting more and more. Come visit often. Next time, you should come to our house. We can spend time together. - I'll take you home. Get in. - No, father, that's ok. "You like restaurants?" "Did you try eating meat bread?" What is that? You should be thankful. He wanted to take you out because you were feeling down. I had other friends who called me out. They're just girls, but he's different. What's different about a guy? You just want me to meet any guy, and marry me off. If you are that embarrassed about me breaking up, I'll just... I'm sorry. But, I... Listen carefully, you didn't break up. There was no marriage, and even the engagement was just a plan. Think of it as going to South Korea as an exchange student. It's true a lot of people don't think that way. I'm just trying to say... we have to look at reality. Father, can we talk when we get home? Does it hurt a lot? Whether it's North or South, how come women always have to suffer? Kim Bong Gu from Club M? You know him? Of course, everyone in this field... I have a reporter friend. He was gathering files to prepare for a report, but it was called off. You want me to ask for the files? Yes, that would be great. Yes. The princess is done, but it's going to be hard to get out. Ask for a car. -Surround the exit, and... -I'm not going. I'm not leaving until all the reporters leave. -You'll be surrounded by other royal family cars... -That's a handicap car. It's going to stick out. I'm not going to brag that I'm a cripple. -But, you can't just stay there. -I didn't say I'll stay. Do whatever you need to do to get me out without getting noticed. Oh, over there. Over there. Follow them. I asked them to send the wheelchair. -There were too many people... -Make sure there's no mistakes. Father... Someone's following. Excuse me. My daughter came here 10 minutes ago? She's with the doctor. Is it a big illness? What a leech. How does it look? Excuse me. There's an ambulance. -Princess, I'll be... -No. Don't leave me alone. You'll be back soon? Of course. What's wrong with you? We tried hard, but we're sorry. What do you mean you're sorry? It was a little over a month. A month? What was? The baby. You didn't know? A baby? Do you know why he's doing that? He left his wife. A wife that only cared for him. -Mom... -Do you know why he left her? Because the wife called him trash. I can't stand people like him.
