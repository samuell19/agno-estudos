DIRECTED BYRYU JANG-HA You can't throw that here. It goes in that bin over there. HELLO SCHOOL GIRL Sir! This is a non-smoking building. Mom. I need your stamp. - Why? - Because. I need to know why before I can give it to you. Why? Don't you trust me? Of course I do. You know how I raised you. You didn't raise me. I did my own growing up. Put your mask on! It's dusty out! - No! - Soo-young! Ow! Hello. Shit. I am so dead. Good. Look. - Your skin looks awful. - Hey! I can even see your pores. The quality is amazing. This is the whole reason I got it. Whatever. It's just a camera. You don't even have one. Oh. You're in trouble now. Crap. I'm so busted. - Mister. - Hey. Where are you headed? I get off at the next stop, at the district office. Is that where you work? Yes. Do you have to wear your tie to work? Excuse me? We have to clean the bathroom if we forget our school tie. - May I borrow yours? - What? Is that a no? Are you out of your mind? Who is he anyway? He's just a neighbor. Mister! I'll see you later. - Hey. - Yeah? Do I look old to you? Yeah. Girls. Keep it down. But... This is elastic, see... Soo-young? What's so funny? Why didn't you get your parents to sign the forms? Fine. You leave me with no choice. Close your eyes. Now. Raise your hands if you live in a rented apartment. Good. Raise your hands if your parents are divorced. What? - I need the information for your records. - What's her problem? Hurry. Raise your hands if your parents are divorced. Do they have to be divorced? What if my dad walked out on my mom? Do I raise my hand for that, too? Soo-young, where'd you get that tie? That's not our school tie. Give me that. Are you busy? - What are those? - I'll show you. It's fake snow. Who uses that in the summer? Not you, apparently. - How are things going? - Good. Take your time. Yeah. I will. I need someone to take the donated clothes. Did Sook go home? He just left. That's not good. I need the clothes cleaned today. Where? Is it far away from here? I need it taken to the cleaner's. I'll send Sook tomorrow. Oh? Why can't you do it? Take these. No one's come to pick them up. How's your new apartment? It's fine. I think I see a stain. Take your shirt off. I can throw it in the wash later. It's just a small stain. That's really okay. Take it off. I won't be able to do this for you once we're gone. Are you moving somewhere? We're going to live next door to our daughter. - Hello. - Hey. Here. Take this. Oh. This looks a little old. It's fine. You can put it to good use. You should stay for dinner. Yes. I actually have plans. You should stay. Come in. Did he tell you to meet him here? Yeah. Where is he? What's taking him so long? What if he asks you to give him money instead? I don't know. How much was your camera? Are you two in high school? Yes. Good times. You don't look so bad yourself. Whew. Why is that guy staring at me? - You're so deluded. - It's true. He's not staring at you. Politics don't work if the guys in charge are rotten. Let him eat. - You're right. - I'm telling you. You must never accept bribes of any kind. Absolutely. It's hard running a country. When will my shirt be ready? Well... - Have some more. - What? I'll get you some more. I'm actually full, but... Damn. This isn't working. Come on. Work. Here you are. Did you win anything? This has to be rigged. I'm sorry I couldn't go to the subway station. I knew you'd be late, so I didn't wait. I should have taken your number. I said I didn't wait for you. Excuse me... Ugh. I'm starving. Did you have dinner yet? Yes. I mean, no. I haven't eaten yet. These are really spicy. Do you have children? I'm not married. Why do you smoke outside then? There's no one at home, and I like the fresh air. Do you live alone? Yes. How old are you? I'm 30. Wow. You're 12 years older than I am. So... 18? Yes. That means we share the same sign. - What? - On the zodiac. Yeah. I guess. You look a lot younger though. I hear that a lot. Don't you like spicy food? Why aren't you eating any? I'm eating. You can dunk it in water like this. Here. What's your name? Soo-young. Han Soo-young. I'm Kim Yun-woo. What are you doing? I'll do it. I don't mean... Where's the bathroom? I'm sorry about your tie. That's okay. I'm not going to wear ties anymore. - Why not? - People say I look old. You are old. I have to pay you back. Kitty. Here, Kitty. Hi. Kitty? How've you been? Is that her name? Her name's Kitty. She looks like a cat. She's a cat dog. Kitty? How'd you get that name? It's so dark. I can't see a thing. Shouldn't you fix that light? Mr. Public Servant. Why do you keep calling me mister? Ouch. Come on. Kitty. She looks more like a cat. I'll take lots of pretty pictures once I get a real camera. This has better picture quality. It's still a cellphone. It's no film camera. It works fine. Well? What? Kitty. Look at the man. It's really pretty. - Wait. I'll get closer. - Okay. Not me. Take a picture of her. Okay. One. Two. Did you just move in? Yes. Which one is it? I'm in 605. - That apartment is haunted. - What? This is a no smoking zone. This is the last train. I'm doing my public service. What are you going to do after? Go back to school? I'm just going to hang out. I used to be like you, too, when I was younger. Hey. I'm not as young as you think. How old are you anyway? Why? How old are you? I'm 29. You? I'm 25. That's a cute sweater. I know. Why did you come up to me? Well... Relax. Why did you agree to come with me? You offered me your light. Sit here. Huh? Repeat after me. Ha-kyung. Let's say goodbye while we still can. - What does that mean? - Say it. Ha-kyung. Let's say goodbye while we still can. But we just met. I didn't bring an umbrella. Searching for Inquiry recipient Gwon Ha-kyung. Too many Gwon Ha-kyungs! Shit! Sorry. I know you hate to hear people swear. It's okay. I've been hearing it a lot these days. What are you doing? Nothing. Hey! You can't look that up. You'll go to jail. No one has to know. Are you crazy? What if you get caught? Don't you have someone you want to know more about? No. Stop acting like such a saint. You shouldn't be doing that. I know I have an umbrella around here somewhere. Hello. Yun-woo? What are you doing here? - Mrs. Han. Here. - Are these for me? Yes. They're for you. To thank you for your help with the apartment. Thank you. Have a seat. That's okay. I should get going. - Are there any problems? - No. Let me know if there are any problems. The owner is a good guy. He'll fix whatever needs fixing. Thank you. Have your parents come to see your new place yet? Not yet. I'm sure they'll like the house. Yes. I don't know what to do. I can't find my umbrella. I need to go pick up my daughter. You can take mine. No. I can't. Take it. I'll just make a run for it. That's very kind of you. - No problem. - Thank you. take care. Soo-young. I'm sorry I'm late. You must be freezing. You shouldn't have come. I told you I was fine. I don't want you to get sick. Will you come with me to the district office? Why? I need to get my registration card. I'm officially an adult now. That doesn't make you an adult. You're right. This does. Look. What's that? This will make my breasts bigger. Right. It's supposed to work. You'll see. I'm an adult now. Whatever. Did you save enough money? No. Lie to your mom and say the lunches went up. Should I? She might not believe you. It's a lame lie. Mom. I need more money for lunch. Just eat your tomato. Who is it? Soo-young? Here. It's for you. You didn't have to. I wanted to pay you back for your tie. Thank you. Do you have a cold? Yes... You should be careful, too. Take two tablets after each meal. You should heat this up first. It got cold on the way over. You didn't have to do this. Thank you. - Would You like some juice? - Sure. This place is so empty. Ew. It stinks of cigarettes. Sorry. I can't let you in there. You must be really lonely here. Did you have anything to eat? You can't take your medicine on an empty stomach. Wait... I'll do it. Go lie down in your room. You'll make me sick, too. Get some sleep. I'll take care of everything. Call me if the food's awful. Too salty! This looks prettier. You're going to lose it in a week anyway. I think it's pretty. How much is this? It's $5, but she was just about to get it. You can each take one. I'll take them both. I'll take two, too. - is one of them for me? - How much do I owe you? We have to get going. - Hey. - What? Little kids are supposed to play in the rain. We're not kids. Loser. Ignore him. He's just a child. - I'll take them both. - Hey! What? Is it that time of the month? Look at that sweater. - He's such a loser. - What Did You just say? Kids. I have more of those in this box. Don't fight. Well then... Since we're taking two each... Will you give us a discount? I'm sorry. I don't think I can help. Get yourself a snack. Why are you crying? - What's wrong? - Don't cry. Blow your nose. Don't cry. Don't cry. Soo-young? Soo-young? Why did you make him cry? Where do I get my ID? What? I need a registration card. I didn't know you didn't have an ID card yet, Soo-young. Mister. Me. She's still too young. Hey! I know you! I've got you now! What are you doing here? Sook? Do you know Soo-young? - Sook? - Sook? Is that really your name? Why did you have to tell them that? That must be so embarrassing. - That's some name for a dude. - I'm sorry. Do you even know these two? They live in my neighborhood. - They're both morons. - What? She needs an ID made. You can take her picture. Which one of you needs the ID? - You? - Yes. Come with me. - I brought a picture with me. - Hurry. Here. You've got to be kidding. This isn't you. That is me. We can't use this. I'm sorry we teased you. Who was that little boy? His dad must have left home. He came to me asking if I can help find his dad. Why can't you find his dad? I can't. We're not allowed. Are you smoking again? How many do you smoke in a day? I go through a pack. You should quit smoking. It's not good for you. You're too old for that. Here. I bought it for my mom, but you can have it. You should give it to your mother. You're the one who needs it. You're going to get sick again if you run around in the rain. Take it. Here. I'm really okay. Here. Thank you. Mister! Aren't you going to thank me for the porridge? I want that other one! I want the teddy bear! No! No! I can't get this thing to work. Why can't you do it right? Something's wrong with this machine. It's not working! How much did you spend on this? I didn't think it'd be that hard. You're hopeless. You can't even find that boy's dad. Soo-young? Do you have 50 cents? No. Let's just go. Okay. You give up pretty easily. Do you want some coffee? I didn't think you saw me. I told you not to follow me. I wasn't. This is my territory. You obviously didn't know. I really like this coffee. - Why do you... - What? Will you open this door? Why do you always keep it locked? I brought you a cereal drink. - Did You add sugar? - Sugar's bad for you. It's going to be bitter. Mom. We should buy strawberry milk. I know what you're thinking, but no. It's not good for you. I know one thing it's good for. Soo-young. Yeah? Hope you enjoy your dinner. You, too. Smoking again? Studying till late? Sweet dreams. See you tomorrow. Get some sleep. Soo-young. Will you throw us the ball? You almost hit me with that thing. What are you doing here, taking pictures? Are you looking for a new place? You haven't called. You told me not to. Good. I'll give you a ride. Where are you going? Ha-kyung? Hey! You're always the same. What do you mean? Nothing. Doesn't this feel great? - I'm hungry. - What was that? I said I was hungry! Okay. I'll take you out to lunch. You can drive. Watch the road. You're heavier than I thought. Want me to take off? No, no. It's okay. I was just joking. You're light! Is that how you eat at home? What? Are you trying to look pretty because you're with me? Are you happy now? I still like you. What do you like about me? You're beautiful. It's all thanks to my makeup. You're so pretty when you smile. You have the prettiest smile I've ever seen. - Sook. - Yeah? You're supposed to dip the noodles in that. I know that. God! Where do you live? I'll take you home. Take this. Or not. Did you get that for me? You said you didn't have an umbrella. - You're so stupid. - I know. - You're hopeless. - I know that, too. You should go. Ha-kyung. Don't walk around in the rain. I don't like you that way. I'm sorry. I like you. Don't kid yourself. Don't expect anything. You'll get hurt. I'm not doing any of that. This will only hurt me, not you. - Sook. - I have to go. I feel like bacon. You need to get some sun. You're way too pale. You want to look tanned, like a pop star. I don't care. I'm burning up. Sit your butt down. Beauty takes a lot of work. No pain, no gain. Is there something we can put on? You bet there is. I've been thinking. It's good for you if you drink it, so what if we poured it on ourselves? Are you serious? Let's try it. Lift up your shirt. Hurry. Lift it up. What's taking so long? You don't have to shine it. It'll sell anyway. This isn't for sale! I need your help inside. Throw this away, too. Mister? - Hello. - Hello. What do You think? It's pretty. It only costs a dollar. Why is your face so red? I was trying something at home. - Is it really red? - Yeah. A little. Are these for sale, too? Yeah. Do these all work? Yup. They work fine. Are there any film cameras here? Film? Soo-young doesn't like digital cameras. She likes old film cameras. - Where's the bathroom? - What? Bathroom? Oh. It's over there. I see you're working hard. Your face is red. Yeah. We were trying something. Yuck. It's lukewarm. It's really hot out. Here. This is cold! Nice! I wish it would snow. When are you done with work? I'm working late tonight. I have to clean up after the event is over. That's too bad. I'll see you later then. Okay. Sir? Can I donate my things, too? Sure. Here. Wait. Yes? I need your name and address. Is that really necessary? Why did I agree to the strawberry milk idea? It's so hot out. Why'd you make me get up? Did you fry your face in oil or something? It hurts so bad. Let's make spicy rice cakes. It's way too hot for that. Let's buy an air conditioner instead. No way. It's so hot in here. I hate this. Should we take a trip? I'll be a senior soon. You can go with one of your guy friends. I had to dump at least 10 guys, because of you. Ten? Are you kidding me? I bet you don't even have one. I'm an old woman with a big burden. What burden is that? You. I'm not a burden. I'm a blessing. This is really spicy. Mom. I need to go out for a while. Where are you going? I need to meet Da-jung. Wow! This is so lame. - What are you doing? - Oh. Hi. I was really surprised to see snow. Soo-young. Do you like taking pictures? How'd you know that? I've been saving up to get a decent film camera. Here. Is this money? No. What is it? It's a film camera! It's a little old, but... It's great. Is this for me? Yes. Wasn't this expensive? No... It was $5. You're lying. It's out of focus. It's so pretty. I think it's got a roll of film inside. Why are you giving this to me anyway? Well... I thought you could practice with this before you buy a better camera. Is there anything you want? Oh. I'm okay. Since it's summer, what if I got you a pair of shades? I've never worn a pair in my life. Really? Yes. Thanks. It'll snow in my dreams tonight. Sweet dreams. Kyu-chul. Yeah. Never mind. Ha-kyung? Let's say goodbye while we still can. But we just met. What's on your mind? Will you take a picture of me? I got rid of my camera. Why? It was too heavy. Really? What about all your pictures? I got rid of those, too. Were you looking for someone? Do you want my help? I tracked down all the jerks who stole money from my mom. I can help you. Can you really? No. Will you look up someone for me? No. I have my pride. Do you? I'm sorry. I was thinking about another guy. Let's never see each other again. Soo-young? What is that? You could get $5 for that if you take it to a junkyard. Take a picture of me. I don't know how to work the settings. Just do it. This isn't a digital camera. Did Yun-woo give you that? What? I'm rooting for you two. - Thanks. - Well? Here goes. Can you develop those? Yeah. Smile. I think the roll's done. What the... Cellphone number? When's your birthday? Birthday? Nov. 17. Why? It can't be. 1, 2, 3, 4. Hello? Anyone home? Sorry. I should go. Oh. I love air conditioning. Slow down. You've had enough. Yun-woo. Have you ever had your heart broken? Sure. My heart's all torn up right now. Do you have a pimple or something? Should I pop it for you? Hey! I'm being serious here. I meant to ask you this before, but do you like baby chicks? How many do you have on that sweater of yours? Good. I'm glad to see you smile. Can I bum a smoke? I'm out. You should quit smoking too, before it tears up your heart. Ha-kyung said this sweater was cute. Sook. Yeah. Do you really like her? Of course. She means everything to me. She fills up all my days. Don't you have anyone like that? Ma'am? Can we get one more bottle of soju? Soo-young. You're in the wrong apartment. Kitty, kitty! Do you miss her? I won't marry the guy I love. I'll keep him in my heart forever. I think it'll be better that way. Besides, you can't live with a guy you really like. It'll be so embarrassing. Soo-young. It's getting late. That's okay. Do you want anything more? No. I'm really full. Who sings this song anyway? It's a really nice song. Oh no. You stretched it all out. Thank you. Mister. Yes. Never mind. Let's just go. Mister. Yes. When were you going to ask me out? Aren't you going to say hi? Ha-kyung! Why didn't you come by the last few days? You must have a lot of free time. I do. Will you go out with me? No. Please? I promise this will be the last date. Do you really want to do this? I'm going to kill myself if you don't say yes. - What? - I said I'll kill myself. What did you do that for? That really hurt! You must really like me. Fine. I won't kill myself, but only if you go out with me. Mister. Yes. Your hand's all sweaty. I'm so happy right now. I know you. You're that girl from the subway. Hi. You look nice today. Are you here alone? - No. - Hey! Crap. You shouldn't be watching an R rated movie. Do you two know each other? She's just some girl. How do you know her? How do you know this jerk? Hey. Show some respect. You two are really cute. Us? You've got to be joking. She's a moron. - Chick! - I'm not wearing that sweater! I see you got a new camera. It was a gift. May I take a look? Yun-woo! Wait. You monster! - Sook. I can explain. - What's wrong? I'm the one who asked him out. What's wrong with that? Do you know the guy who lives next door to me? - The district office guy? - Yeah. Yeah. I know him. I've been hearing rumors. He seems nice to me. He's very polite. Well. No one must have told you. What are you talking about? Are you suggesting he likes me or something? That's your last one. Fine. I won't drink anymore. You can have this. I'm done. You'll get to drink as much as you want once you're older. I don't want to be a grownup. I think adults are cowards. They get scared easily. I don't want to become like that. Do you think I'm like that? I think you're adorable. We should watch a horror flick next. Can we walk arm in arm? I've got my arms crossed already. Will you walk arm in arm with me? What about now? Please? Will you walk arm in arm with me? I have so much fun with you. I know. Why are you saying that? Let's go. I'll walk you. Who is it? Oh. Mrs. Han. Am I supposed to join the Women's Association? We only accept female members. Oh. Right. Are you seeing anyone by any chance? Excuse me? I thought I could introduce you to a nice young girl. I have many friends. No. Thank you. Don't your parents want to see you settle down? Did you say they were living in the country? Actually, they both passed away when I was little. Oh. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Kim Kyu-chul. That was his name. Remember how you made me get on the subway train one time? One night, I was waiting for the train and I fell asleep. He woke me and made me get on the subway, too. He said that was the last train. Those were his first words. He had a bike just like yours. It was old and rickety. I don't want to hear this. We went to the soccer field once. It was snowing that night. Did you two kiss there, too? Did you share coffee, too? Did he buy you that camera, too? I'm not him. I'm not the guy who left you. Why are you telling me this anyway? Don't you think I have any pride? Is this funny to you? Is it? You think you're the only one who's been hurt, who's had their heart broken? Sook. Forget it. I wonder where he is. Is he not picking up? No. I hope Sook is okay. I wonder what's wrong. He'll be fine. I'll go to his house later. That old man is back. I guess he hasn't moved yet. This is so discouraging. Did you read about this in the paper? What is it? You need to save electricity. That A/C's been running all day. - That's a big waste. - Oh. We're sorry. Rapidly increasing sex crime which target is woman Those little things can make a big difference, you know. Hey. It's Yun-woo. - Hello. - Hello You must have come to see Soo-young. - Oh. - Hey! Good luck. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Mister. - Yeah. Why'd you come here? Oh. No reason. Should we go play that game? What game? No. I want that over there. Okay. I said that one. Over there. Okay. We almost had it. This isn't easy. We're out of change. I'll go get some. Soo-young. It's late. I'll get the doll for you later. Are you mad? No. You should have kept trying till you got that doll. You give up really easily. I knew it. You're mad. I'm not mad. I promise I'll get you a really pretty doll next time. Good. That's a promise. It's nice having you pick me up. There's no one around. Should we hold hands till we round that corner? Sure. Your hand is really warm. That means you're a cold person. I'm not a cold person. I'm just lonely. Mom. Mom? Mom. I really like this man. Mrs. Han. I read about the crime spree, so I was waiting for my daughter. Do you two know each other? Why is there no A/C in here? It's so stuffy in here. Were you in a fight? No. I just got beaten up. What happened to you? What do you mean? When did you start dating Soo-young? We're not dating. She's just a kid. You can't lie to me. I saw you at the movie theater. Tell me it's not statutory rape. How can you even say that? I was just asking. You'd better not break her heart. I wouldn't do that. I hate those assholes who make women cry. You're an adult. Soo-young's only 18 years old. I'm sorry. I know you're not a bad man, but I don't want my daughter dating a man who grew up without parents. I'm sorry. Kitty. I got a new camera. Here. I'll take a picture of you. What's wrong with that light bulb? Are you still alive? Are you still alive? I wonder what Mister's up to. Eat your breakfast. No. You have to eat something. Soo-young. We need to talk. He's an adult. He's not who you think he is. He's not irresponsible. He's not like dad. You don't know anything about him. You don't know how he grew up. What are you talking about? It's going to be okay. You're right. I really am a burden. Soo-young. Soo-young! What are you doing here all alone? I looked all over for you. Aren't you going to say anything? What are you going to do? I don't know. You're both such cowards. Who is it? Surprise. I just came from class. Why are you looking at me like that? Were you here alone? Aren't you glad to see me? I thought you'd be bored. You should give this to Sook. It's for Ha-kyung. Sure. Did you smoke again? You should have opened the windows at least. I'll forgive you this time. Look at all that dust on the A/C. You should clean it. Are you hungry? I am. Should we go for rice cakes? Are you free this weekend? Should we go take pictures? Maybe next time. Liar. You always make empty promises. Soo-young. I'm an adult. I'm old. I have a job. I lie all the time. I know. So... I'm no different from all the other men you hate. You're no fun. I should go. Soo-young. Mister. Why did you let go of my hand? Were you scared of what people might say? No. Why did you do that? Well... It's okay. I know you give up easily. I'm sorry about what I said to you before. How are you holding up? Here. They were taken by Ha-kyung. Kim Kyu-chul Deceased) 10 cents. 20 cents. 30 cents. Are you sorry to leave? No. I'm glad we're moving closer to my daughter's place. You didn't have to come here. I know you're busy. I'm not busy at all. I'm just a civil servant. I came to see you guys. Is everything all right? Of course. This is harder than it looks. That's not so hard. Thank you. Here. I'll take that. That's okay. No. I insist. How is Soo-young doing? She's mad at me because I asked you to stay away from her. It's hard. I'm sorry. This must be hard on you, too. You've lost so much weight. I'm old and I was starting to get a gut, so I decided to go on a diet. No! This is not a lucky day for me! Did you miss it again? Why should you care? Those glasses look nice. I see you grew your mustache. Isn't it handsome? That's not funny. Soo-young. Your mother's really sad because of you. I hope you can be a good daughter to her. I hope you can stop being good for once in your life. Sook! Yeah. Are you giving up? What about you? It's raining. You should hurry. Bye. Get inside! Love your A/C. Hope you find this before summer ends. Smile! There. Now I need your letter. Let's see. "Daddy. I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me." Kid. You should work on your handwriting. Don't tell anyone I did this for you. I won't. It's the picture lady. What? Hello. Hi. Do you remember me? Yes. Hello. Hello. It's a nice day we're having isn't it? Yes. It is. Is Sook around? He's been discharged from the army. Oh. I see. Bye. Ha-kyung? Yes? You should take the subway home. It's a non smoking area. How've you been? I was sick. Was it bad? Not really. Are you okay now? Here. Do you miss him? I'm sure he's doing well. Yes. I'm sure he is. I lied to you. I'm really 22 years old. I'll walk you home today. Really? I heard it's going to rain, but I didn't bring my umbrella. I brought mine. Should I get that box, too? We're almost done. You should change out of that. I'm okay. - You're covered in sweat. - Really? Didn't anyone come pick this up? It looks nice on you. You can keep that. It's a gift. It's a little too wild for my taste. It looks good to me. Is that a photo album? Who's that? It's my son. I didn't know you had a son. Is he coming today? If he were alive, he'd be your age by now. Why are you saying these things? I wasn't saying anything. Besides, you're the one who brought out the albums. They make a good couple. They were so cute together. Do you have a girl in mind, too? I see you do. Can I take those piggy banks? I need lots of coins. Sure. You can take them. I'll pay you for them. Sir! You can't do that here! Sorry! I came to get my ID card. I see. Did you bring a picture with you? No. - Soo-young? - Yes? I like you. What? I like you. Soo-young. Don't hate your father. If he hadn't left, I would have. I only stayed behind for you. I know that. Have you seen that pair of shades in my closet? They were your father's. No. I haven't seen them. Soo-young. I'm not going to give up on us. Have you decided to be a bad guy for once? Do you kids have email? I can send you the pictures. No. We don't. I do. Subtitles by LeapinLar
