LTRG > German Audio 448 KBPS 5.1 / Eng Sub Special thanks to Mrs. TrashCity They are here. Spread and attack. Rei? It's swelling! It hurts so much! I can't bear it! It's about to burst! Chapter 1 The Awakening One month ago What can that be? Why does it hurt so much? What is that? The elder race of legend has returned Good Morning. Same to you. How are you? Here, honey. Do you still have time for breakfast? Thanks. Unfortunately not. Well, does your arm still hurt? I've never had anything like that before. It really hurts. If you study hard today, you'll get something nice to eat. Today I'll conjure up a delicious cake for you. Really? That's great. One more thing. A surprise. What? What is it? It won't be a surprise if I tell you. She's coming. Oh yeah, this will be serious fun. Why do they let her kind in our school? Come on, girls - stay ready. Then the fun can begin. Let's see how she reacts. Nice shot. Why do they always have to pick on me? Ah, I have another gift for you, Rin. And I got one for you too. You can't stand on one leg. Well, well, look at you. You can go hiking now. She looked real hip. Really? Yes, they would go well with the red boots. Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh, What happened here!? Who did that? I did, teacher! So what? Food is not to play with. Such a good boy. Good boy. When you retire, you could work as a janitor. It's a great thing, or not? If you want to live as a human, you have to start making the best of it tomorrow. Who are you? Wait. Oh, there you are. I was looking for you. Really? Don't be frightened. I want to apologize for earlier. Do you forgive me? Huh? You know, I grew up rich, but no one had time for love. And then when I see someone who is poor, I envy them for that and get real jealous. This is the reason why I... ! Forgive me. Of course. But I can't help it! She fell for it! Idiot. Ah, you're awake. Where are my glasses? You have eyes like a lynx. Why are you wearing that thing? In fact, she's right. Or not? I want to see down your throat. Please open your mouth and put out your tongue. May I ask you a question? You are no Homo Sapiens. Huh? Doctor Sasahara, MD, at the Kurenai high school. Code number 33-42. Yes, I think she's a Hilko. She will remain under my supervision until you are there. Police officers from the Racial Supervision Unit are on the way. Time for some beauty sleep. No! No! Congratulations on your 16th Birthday, Rin. Happy Birthday! Papa, Mama. You know that I...! It's so terrible. And I can't... Is everything all right? Daughter? What happened? Don't cry. The guest of honor is not allowed to cry at their party. - Listen to your father. - Crazy little daughter? You're right. Rin. From today, you are now 16 years old. And this is the day...! The time has come where I have to tell you something very important. Watch carefully. This is the true identity of your father. Surprised? This is not my penis. Surprised? No! It hurts, right? It was the same for me. I remember it well. I was 16 years old. Suddenly my atria hardened. Right? Calm down. It's normal - look closely. Mother, are you one as well? Mother, no! No! Formation! Four. No! We are five. To balance out a Hilko that is far too human. Right? Hilko? Nose bullets on them! Fire! Leave my daughter alone! Out of the way! No! Father?! It's not working! Go get her! The outstanding technology of Ukrainian Fencing has been refined in Shin-Koiwa. Suck my sword. You cut off the hand. Up! Immediately! Very good! Okinawa-technique! Get out of here! Rin! Go! And don't be afraid. Rin. Cabaret of the great idols It's time again for Leilani's "Pick a cute guy while shopping!" Let us welcome back the sweet boys this week. Here they are. Hello. - Hi. - Hello. I'm interested to know why you think you are sweet boys. Tell her about that sweet little chick. Yes, later. Oh, no. Sure! The truth is.. The elders. The elder race? Yes, yes. There are rumors around town. That's a fact. Every ten years, the evil comes down to us from the mountains! And we caught it, and made it the mascot of the shopping center. Unbelievable! There's one! So, no rumor. Why do you do that? Tell me! Shige! Something horrible just happened! A sweet boy is dead! It all happened so fast... I couldn't see exactly... What's she talking about? So there are a few of the legendary elder race, after all. I would like to stuff some, and use them as an attraction in front of my store. Come on! They're over there! Do you have a plan? Of course. You and me, this will work. I need help. Oh no. Are you okay? She is one of the elder race, she's dangerous! Tomiko!? Come on, people, get that brat for me, so I can stuff her for my store. And I shit on respiratory protection! Everyone in town seems to be after her. I can't believe it! What's the Matter with these people? We're only a local station, reporting daily events! What's all that noise? Just concentrate on what you're doing, or it'll be a pain in the ass. Tomiko is dead now! Hey! Everything is shiny! That's true! Get out of my line of fire! Oh, sorry. Tomiko! You love bread, just like me. I wouldn't mind reincarnating as a baguette. That's really cute. It's unbelievable how many people she has slaughtered in a short time. Did I miss anything? Tomiko's death begs for vengeance! Hello. Things are getting really rough right now. Watch out, behind you! The legendary elder race attacks the camera crew. Idiot, you screwed up my bread! You should take a break! Go! My wife is a baguette! You killed all the nice people here at the mall! Now it's my turn! Hit me if you can. I will never... I will never hesitate again. And now it's time to say goodbye. Are you ready? That girl. Rin? Happy birthday. What? Chapter 2 The Revolution Sit down. Where am I? Tell me! The Hilko lived in peace for thousands of years, maintaining their good reputation. But then Homo Sapiens arose, disturbing the equlibrium. The balance was gone. They hate us and attack us wherever they can. They hunt us with the aim of completely wiping out our race. All this, because we are much stronger than them. Very few know at all that we actually exist. Their fear is deep in their subconscious and has taken roots. And no matter where we hide, they find us and let their hatred run wild. But! But... Now it's the final straw. It's over. Yes, it's over. You are the army. You will learn to fight without mercy against them and not to fear death. The day on which we will restore balance is within reach! What's that? - Ah. - Ah. It has been a very long time since someone wore that. Hello. Hello. Ah. Everything begins with it. And when I get rid of this annoying thing? If you keep thinking like that, you can wait another hundred years. First of all, you should introduce yourself. Good manners would show you are worthy to be among us. Worthy? I'll show you what we mean. This is Lemme's Butt-Saw. A sharp matter, huh? My waitress's breasts are dangerous. The swords of Sachie! Impossible! Sumire has Katana-hands. The great red spot of Miki. Isn't it a unique red? These are the germinating hands of Mari! We do everything together, he and me, Nonoko! Now it's Cyako's turn, the greatest belly dancer in the world! See? It's good you are with us now! Never! Mother!? You can't run away, because from now on, you are one of us forever. Why? That's the way it is. Rei? Rei? Ah, so this is the new one! It looks better on you than on me. It depends on your skills. Develop them as soon as possible, and you'll get rid of it real quick. I'm the unbeatable sister, Yoshie. Yoshie, why are you here? Oh, the master is looking for you. Kisaragi wants to see me? You want to talk to me? Rei, how's Rin? Is everyone coping? Of course. It means a lot to them. Rei it's very important to me, that you teach them and show them everything. Why me? She should become the perfect soldier. And you are the only one with that criteria. But...! You don't like that? No. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Go! Nose to the armpits! Don't drop it. If you do, there's a week without food for us! Tense your abdominal muscles. Again. Your friends could bear this, for sure. Punch! Now! Punch! Put more hip into your swing, that'll help. - Punch! - That's all wrong. With more power! Spin! Punch! Position! Go! Go! Next! This is a special suit. What you are wearing now, will protect you when you are in their world. This suit is for war. It's yours. Aha. Come on! - You can do it. - Yes, good. - Go for it. - Take your best shot. Oh, come on! One, two, three. finish her! - One, two, three, finish her! - Yes, you can do it. Go on, yes! You got her! Come on, do it! You got her! Come on! So? Do you like the suit now? You can leave whenever you want. This won't work. Here! Thank you. Rei is very strict, I know. I got my training from her, so I know how you feel. Oh. Where did you get that? This cross is a very important keepsake for Rei. In the antique shop...! Antique shop? Oops! Please don't tell anyone. She lost all her relatives when she was young. She wandered alone through the world. And then, three years ago, she lived near the village of Tohoku. And then, everything changed. The villagers found out the truth and sold her to a freak show. How terrible. Yes, I know. But... there was a boy, she really liked. A boy? From the new race? Exactly! One day he came to see the show and fell for her. He was the only one she could trust and could understand her. Hi Rei. This is for you. I'll always be there for you. And what happened to the boy? He died. The others eventually found out and killed him. They cut through his spinal column. Rin, stop trying to stare holes in the air. Come on. I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. Almighty Izanami. Answer me, Izanami! Answer me, Izanami! Give me strength to act. You, Izanami, Mother of Hilko. I have begged you for millenia, that you bring the Hilko-Clan to victory. Rejoice, human beings. Your blood will be a sacrifice, and food for Inzanami. Am I dreaming? Where are we? What does that mean? Gaze upon the strength of the Hilko! My talent cuts through cartilage and bones. Arise! - Arise! - What's that? Arise! What did you expect? No mercy for you, human plague! In this way, you will remember your Hilko roots. You'll grow a spine, you slacker. I will study you very carefully. Real cute, Papa and Mama. Food for the school. Birthday cake. Cut it out! You don't have the right to ba a Hilko, you were far too happy! Suffer and fight against the hatred that permeates you! All your good days are over! Die! The wind, I can feel it blowing. The mask has gone. That only happens, when a Hilko discovered its true abilities. As you have just done. We all wore it for almost a year. Rin, You seem to be something special. Are you sure? Me? Someone special? Sure! A hybrid between the elder ones and the new race. What? And you, mother? Are you one of them? She was no...! A hybrid? You can't be serious, Kisaragi! That's disgusting! It's a fact, that we are few in number. Right? She is the answer. Izanami has been speaking to me today. Rin, she has a mission for you. This can't be. Honestly? This will be your first task. And your target is Hiroaki Koshimizu, General of the Department of Defense. The repulsive military man who started the Anti-Hilko Branch. Destroy that monster. The operation will take place next week, during a party he will throw. A lot of politicians, business leaders and followers of the General will be there. Oh God, she's in my class. Are you serious? - Oh, the itching is unbearable. - Take Yoshie with you as support. And don't worry, Rin. You can do this. Anti-Hilko Weapons Release Party Katsudon is only cooked on special occasions, right? That's right. Sometimes I really like home cooking, you know. This crackers with fresh cream arn't bad. Welcome. Welcome. It's urgent! It's very urgent! What happened? I don't know, but it seems to be very important. I just ask, because I know you are only a nurse and...! I can't breathe. I'm suffocating. Would you be so kind ...! Oxygen would help. - That'd be too much of a good thing. - I'm suffocating! I have no choice. It's a real emergency. This can't be! Do-do-done! Rin? Okay, okay! May I have your attention please. The film you saw in our cinema today, has unfortunately been broadcast as a live show by mistake. We won't tolerate the recent attacks by the Hilko-Clan against us ever again. It is time to act and to destroy them once and for all. These legendary, vulgar creatures! Thanks to your care and patriotic effort, we have the latest generation of our weapons. Our weapons. And I can tell...! I can tell you now, and proudly announce that they have arrived here! And now I present to you our new digitized amazing Anti-Hilko-Retaliation-Missiles. The Predatory Crickets! Predatory Crickets! What the...? It was settled, that you two appear later! They arn't the pros...! What were you thinking when...! Wait a minute. - I don't know that girl... - I know one of them. - ...she scares me. - No good. Downstairs. Oh, do something. Haruo! Go! Go! We're the Hilko-Clan's Girls Squad! On behalf of Izanami, we'll teach your arrogant race a painful lesson! General Hiroaki Koshimizu, I hope you are ready! What does it mean? You wimps, get them! Come on! I'll grill your asses! Fire! What are you doing? Stop it! Take it out! What's happening to me? You handle this. This is what you deserve. It hurts! It hurts so much! Stop it! Stop it! I-I-I'll be right back. General? Haruo, let me go! Koshimizu?! Here is where you get off. You're right. Koshimizu! I hope you're not hurt, sir. You're late! Finish her! You murderer! Most of my bodyparts are now Japanese technology. It collects everything bad, and transforms them into pure energy. And so an entirely new kind was born. The Predatory Cricket! Soon we'll know how well that super weapon works. Nervous? Let's go. You like that? Again! And again! Ribbons! Now you can't run away from me! And next thing I gonna do is to sent you straight back to where you belong... to your ancestors! It's time to cool you down with a little breeze. Rin! Riiin! Yoshie! What the...?! What's that?! This is outrageous! You can't do this! Oh, no. I'm losing my memory at high speed. How much Udon-noodles I ate last year? That was a merciful death, compared to when you've killed my parents! Great! That was awesome! Honestly! Leave me alone! What are you doing? Now you feel real strong, huh? Listen, idiot. The Prime Minister personally ordered me here. He wants your entire clan wiped out. The cattle trucks are waiting at the Koenji station, and I...! I'm a General... Ah! This won't work without pants. A rice bowl. I have to see what's in there. Believe it? It's Katsudon. It looks delicious. I never felt so bad that I would leave a bowl of Katsudon. Now the delicious Katsudon is unbearable. Too bad! Kill those people. But...! Koshimizu clearly said it. We're in total war. So, here is where we start. Don't hurt us! I beg you! I don't wanna die! Pardon my bad behavior! I'm on my knees! I'm at your mercy! You have to forgive me! I implore you, spare us! Don't do that! Don't do that! Having doubts, Rin? Stop... I can't do it. I can't. No! It's drafty... Mina? Stop right now! Shut up! You two are stupid and naive! Ouch. Father? How is my little one? Long time no see. I think, I'd rather be with you, so everything would be at an end. Your place is here. You have to provide recognition. Ours too. And that means? Since yesterday everything is going wrong. The laws of Hilko are strict. We are not allowed to unite with human beings. But then I saw this woman. I fell in love at first sight and left everything behind for her. You know who she is. Your wonderful mother. Sayuri, the most beautiful of all. She was the greatest treasure. Something that you meet only once in a lifetime. I knew I would give up everything for her. And so I left my clan. Of course, they mocked me and said, I'm too ugly anyway. And even now, that I'm dead and miss you, I'll never regret my decisions! Never doubt it. You must listen to your heart and follow its path. It will always show you the right way. Rin, turn around! Girls, party time! - Yes! - Yes! Rin, I brought breakfast. Yoshie, what's happening? Terror attack. They want to destroy us. And if you work hard enough, Kisaragi will forgive you. We can do it, right? So, Yoshie. Just fighting won't do it. Huh? And why not? We must ensure that it ends. This is high treason. They'll sentence you to death. That's for sure. About the orders during the party, did you feel it was right? Stop it. So you think Rei only obeyed the order? Do you really believe that? Stop it! Yoshie, wait! If you don't stop talking I'll smack you. You and I can end this once and for all. I said I'll smack you! I say it again and again. This war is not right! Why... haven't you used your powers? It felt wrong on a friend. And you? You didn't use yours either. So, what you're saying is, it's the same reason. Come on, Yoshie, here we go. Chapter 3 Insurrection Look what's coming. What's that? What the hell is that? I'll catch these Hilkos in a flash. And then I build them, so rich people can have a bio-weapon. You own a lot of land, you might use them there as well. Hilkos filled up with worm shit, that's what they deserve! Welcome to the party. The Hilkos are celebrating a special resurrection. Dynamite! Ding, Dong! Rei, I beg you, stop it right now. Are you stabbing us in the back? I fucking hate you, you half-breed. Bring her here. Finally do the right thing! Izanami is thirsty for fresh blood. Blood from the largest blood sucker. Here. Hilkos are nothing more than a pile of shit. Only good to use as fertilizer. Try to kill me. Use your head! I can destroy Japan alone, I don't need your help for that! Rin, you should run after her! But...! I'm fine! Go! All right. Yoshie? Wait, you silly bitch! I'm your enemy now. The fun is over. And you are happy that he sends the Hilko-Clan to oblivion? It's an honor to fall in battle! As Hilko! You see the new ruler of this country! What the...? And this sword is harder than a samurai's! Puny clones, you think your nose-balls can harm me? You try to be like Kisaragi. It's Kisaragi-SAN to you! Rei, do you remember this? Someone really liked you. Remember that. It's for you. I'll always be there for you. Rin? Rei, I know it and you know it. It hurts a lot, when you lose a loved one. I won't remember. I will never have to feel that sadness again. Stop it! No one should have to feel this grief. No Hilko and no human. Please, stop it! Out of here! Fools, go home and play Pachinko, that's the one thing you are good for! You can't escape! Kisaragi also ordered me to stir up hatred among the people even more. But I decided to ignore that order after I realized my mistake. People who want to command others, must first earn their trust. Rei. You have to wake up. To him we are just tools he can use. Rin? You're so right, you wimp! Rei! You'll be a special sacrifice for Izanami! That's it! Now I'll finish you with my belly sword. I embody... Evil! Kisaragi, you abuse the Hilko's rules. I don't wanna hear it! For that I'll let you suck my blood! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Rin, Rei, I'm coming. Stop it! What happened? Rei! Save the state secretary. We still haven't finished this. What's that? What a nuisance! Yoshie! Down, boy. That's good. Not good! We also have a right to life. The laws also apply to us! Just like always. Don't you dare! Come on! I want you to go down! Done. Not quite. And what shall we do now? First, we should get out of here. And after that? No idea. But we're still standing. And we will remain that way. I didn't want your help. You are a pack of disgusting lowlifes, from an iguana contaminated Hilko-Hatchery!
