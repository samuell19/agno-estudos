Lacy, watch out! Excuse me your highnesses, but you're going to be late, And this restaurant recipe begs to order. Well, I think it would be a crime if you didn't participate. I thought we could even get you a new dress, Michael Paul's. Fine! But I'm not making a speech. Oh no, I think that's a big mistake. I think you should do it. Look who's up? Thank you for joining us this morning. Why can't we have pancakes? How many chapters of Latin did you do? Hmm! I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. I didn't do any, okay! Are you felicitous now? Shayne, I know you're playing with that stupid video station, What did I say about that? I wasn't, I swear. Then what did you just stuff under your bed? Nothing. Don't you lie to me Mister, You have a Life Skills exam tomorrow. How do you plan to pass if you're too busy stealing cars And shooting black people? I was studying what not to do, okay? Oh, very funny, young man! All right, next time I hear it, I am taking it away. What do you think of this little number? That is darling. Oh, look at that! Oh Bethany, you have to see the... Oh, well, that dress is one of our more sophisticated items, And I know sophistication when I see it. Well, I... I think it looks like something your dad might wear. I think this one suits you; pink is her favorite color. Everything she has is pink. - Michael Paul! - Yes. How much for the earrings, She is the valedictorian after all? $14. All righty! Hmm! Well, you know what, I think you can just borrow something of mine, Can't you sweetheart? What? Just cause I'm a mom doesn't mean I don't have snazzy things. In a game of truth or dare, you pick dare, Always totally unlike me. Dude, hurry man I'm running out of gas. What makes us so unique is that we are... How are you going to wear your hair? I don't know. Well, sweetie, it's tomorrow. Lacy needs to go out. I can't do everything now, can I? I wish I could, but I can't. Ooh, how about a French braid, I bet that would look so pretty on you? Lacy! Stop playing with that gangbang machine, Your sister's almost ready. And now your grandmother is here and the ceremony starts at noon. Why should I give a crap? What did you just say? Don't you dare talk to me that way, Just because your father gave you That jerk off contraption Doesn't mean that I can't take it away, and I will... For the Love of God, Mother. Sweetie, Let me know if you need any help with your makeup? No! Move the tassel to the side. Oh, oh, look at you. I never thought I'd see the day. Will you move over June, I can't see my knockout of a granddaughter? Did you take the lens cap off mother? Don't be stupid. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Pruitt home-school class of 2011. Will you give me a shot of the valedictorian Getting her diploma? I couldn't make one, the printer ran out of ink. For God's sake, June! Sweetheart, look what just came in the mail for you. Congratulations on choosing Phelps University For your online bachelors' degree. No! No! Excuse me little Ms. Sassy Pants, I was under the impression you wanted to go to college. I do. I just thought I could go to Valley or something. Community college only offers associates degrees; Online is for four years. Well, I guess I didn't realize You'd saved up thousands of dollars for your education. I guess when you're ready to pay, you can make your own plan. I can't believe my little girl is going off to college. Kevin, winners train, losers complain. Financing, this is Dale! Hey dad, it's Bethany. Hi! Hi Princess! This isn't really the best time right now. Mom's making me go to college at home. Listen, I can't really hear you. You know what, I will call you back. Okay? I love you. Bye, bye, you're my princess, bye! K! Bye! Well done! Sweetheart, who was that on the phone? Child abuse hotline. Fucking bitch! Shayne? What? I bet dad would never make us paint his house. He probably has a bunch of illegal aliens do all his Stuff for him. Hey! What are you guys doing? Nothing! That's cool! You going to Valley next year? Actually I think I'm going to take some online classes first. That's cool! - Are you going to Valley? - Me? No, me and my cousin just signed up for the Marines. Wow! Yeah. Well see you! See you! Shut up! In 1949, communist rebels take over China and a country falls. Did you have a nice trip, mom? That's very funny young man. Keep joshing like that And you're never going to college like your sister here. How's my little co-ed doing with her bookkeeping review? Fine! The current ratio equals current assets Divided by liabilities. That's what it says. Hi dad! Kiddo! Hello Dale! You know, I really don't appreciate you calling During school hours. Oh, come on June, it's freaking summer already, I don't know with that stick up your ass, But they sure put it in there good. Well, you did Dale, you stuck it up there, Same way you shoved it up your Daughter's sixth grade music teacher's butt. Remember that? That little high recorder incident with Mr. Kinkle. Lord knows we all do. Oh Jesus, June, Stop blaming me for your miserable life, And stop smothering my kids. Don't you dare question how I am raising these kids, If anything, you should be thanking me. I had Bethany through AP Calculus Before she was even menstruating. You listen up lady, and you listen up good, Maybe you're the reason I'm queer. Did you ever think about that one? 12 years with you is enough to turn any man gay! Hi! How are you? Later bro. What's up? Nothing! That's cool! What are you doing later? I don't know, probably just watching a movie or something. Yeah, there's this girl that lives over at Rancho Vista, And she's having a party, Me and my homies are going, you should come. Oh, would you look at that? Oh, that's precious! I don't feel very good. All right! I'm going to go to bed. Okay sweetie. You let me know if you need anything. # There ain't no debating there's a cold front # Blizzard in the middle of the house # Every time I want to make a run for it # You give me reason to stick it out # Oh oh oh oh... # Oh oh oh oh oh... Do you want a beer? Is this Truth or Dare? Say what? Dawg, I just asked her if she wants some brew, that's all. Word. Just chill, bro! Hey... when did you get into white chicks? Nice outfit honey. Are you okay? Look at her black underwear. Use this as a cover-up. You will feel better when you have something to drink, I swear.

Here you are mother. Let's see what else we have... oh, oh, are these your Johns? Well, good luck with them. They're probably all Nancy boys like your father. Now, what do we have next? Oh, this is such a nice blouse, it has a lot of cleavage And that ought to be very good for business. All right! That's enough, June. And nice earrings for a streetwalker. # Take a look at this cozy room # We won't be moving any time soon. # Take a look at this crazy life # Now tell me if you think it's raining right # Or we can talk it over # But I want to let you need... # Come here and just stay here # You're lucky, you made it # We already had this fight...

Well, my boy friend hates putting his dick in a wrapper; He says it's like eating a burger With the paper still on it. That's kind of cute. Really? What do you use for protection? My boyfriend is in the Marines, But I'm seeing someone else and we use rubbers. And he doesn't bitch about it? That's right, home girl, He just needs to be happy he's getting some. And my boyfriend's being such a dick right now, He's not returning my texts or anything. I'm thinking about showing him and getting pregnant. Of course if I get pregnant I can't go to FATI. What's FATI? Fashion Art and Technology Institute. I'm applying for the winter session, It's in San Francisco. I guess if I had a baby I could give it to my mom and go in the summer. I want to go. I want to meet your boyfriend, we should double or something. We should. Who's up you guys? Still you. Wooh! Go Brianna! Get off. Baby! I don't want you on here right now. Nice one!

Nice helmet fucktard. Sick dog, what's his name? Lucifer. Nice! Badass, is there a medium? It's not like they'll miss it. What about the balance sheet?

I don't want it, okay? - Why not? - Because I already have it. Make sure your shoulders are totally parallel Before you half it. Yours overlap sometimes. Sorry. You know, I'm thinking of training you for cashier. Really? Yeah, I think you would be decent, With all that account balance bullshit. Wow! Thank you! What size are you? Small.

Bye girlfriend! Bye! Did you see that? What the fuck was that? Okay, I have to study Returns and Exchanges. Don't worry sweetheart, I'm not going to bother you. Did I tell you about that time Terry ran off With that total flamer who sold online ads for the Penny Saver? Yes, you did. Coffee, sweetheart? Where's Chip? Gone. What did you do? I didn't do anything, he did. He cheated on me. Oh that's bullshit! Pumpkin; I saw him with my own two eyes Behind the Casablanca. I knew it all along though, didn't I? What else it is new, right? I gave him my heart and my soul, Not to mention my Miata. What does he do take a big piss all over me. Ah! Ah! Why me? Huh? Why me? Why can't I win? Where are you going, Princess? Hey! Want me to wrestle you up some breakfast? Uh-oh! I'm done. If you're short, You just write it on this form here. And you don't get in trouble? Not if it's under like 20. Cents? Dollars!

I will... I will ask for some time off. That's okay Bethany, I was going to fire you anyway. Why? Turns out you were right about The whole account balance bullshit, Regional knows someone's been stealing And I told them it was you. Ah! You told me to.

It says there's insufficient funds. Well, I know. That's why I'm making a deposit. No ma'am, the check's no good. What do you mean? It's my ex-husband's. He has an account with this bank. There's not enough money in his account to cover it. Are you sure? I'm looking at the account now. Well, can you give me what he has? That's not how it works. Just when were you planning on telling me, Because a little warning would have been nice? Well, what can I tell you, June, People just aren't buying cars. Tell her about the B&B. Here's the thing. Chip and I are thinking about moving down to Baja And opening a B&B. Uh, what? Excuse me! With what money, and what about us? What did that moron do now? Mother, please! How many times do I have to tell you, Get off your ass, get a job and get a fucking life. I do have a life, Dale, It's a very rich life, And I do have a job, It's called bringing up our children, It's called sheltering them, It's called protecting them from cretins like you. Oh lady, you are such a fucking nightmare. Well, maybe you should have thought about that Before you talked a certain young woman Into having unprotected premarital relations. Believe me, I do. I think about it every goddamn day of my fucking life. It's enough. Okay. All right, fine, thanks. Thank you! June, your dog just upchucked. Oh, You're here early. Don't you have community service? It's finished. I'm finished. That's cool! Yeah, yeah, it's cool! So yeah, you know, I'm probably going to have to cut back your hours A little bit. To what? Maybe none. I mean, I mean, I realize that we've been selling Gobs of dresses, But I just can't afford to have you on the floor anymore, so... What about my designs? Well, you know, maybe Fashion Cottage will want to buy them, But I've just been getting a lot of complaints From some of our older customers. All they buy are pantyhose. Well, I guess, some people are Just really bad with change. And then the FBI unsuccessfully Attempted to negotiate. Sweetheart, what are you doing home? I want to kill myself. That's exactly what the Branch Davidians said. It's supposed to be right there, But I don't understand what's happening to textbooks. Well, I'm sorry, but since your deadbeat dad Decided to skip out on his support obligations, We all need to contribute. You stole my money. I did not; I borrowed it. Jesus June! Well, how do you think that I make ends meet with your father Gallivanting off to Mexico? I mean, how do you think we put food on the table And have a roof over our heads? What about grandma? Why can't you ask grandma for help? No, no, I will not go crawling back to that woman With my hand out, not in million years. But it's okay to steal from your daughter. It's not like she is even going to be here for much longer. Who? What? Who? I'm so sorry, grandma. No one wanted to tell you, but you're dying. I'm sorry. Ah! Right, fine, mother, you're not dying. Are you happy now? Well, how else was I supposed to get Bethany to come home? I trusted you. Well, life is full of disappointments, It's better you start getting used to them now. Shame on your, June Pruitt. You apologize to your daughter. For what? For borrowing money Or for a tiny little white lie? All right, fine! I apologize if my fib. Don't even. What the hell's going on? You really are trying to kill me, aren't you? I'm doing the best I can here, mother. Oh, you can't do anything, can you? Watch your mouth, mother. I will not be belittled in my own house. You mean your ex-husband's house, Or maybe now I should call it your daughter's house. Why do you hate me so much? All I ever do is try to please you And all you ever are is mean and ugly. I don't hate you; I hate the decisions you make. You fall for a fruit man, you run off and marry him. Boy June, you really know how to pick them. Well, guess what, mother, I did it to get away from you. Did you ever think of that? I got on the first horse I could And I got the hell out of Dodge. Yeah, but why did you have to pick ass biscuit? Oh come on, I wasn't that bad, was I? I was just trying to toughen you up. You're too sensitive. That's your problem. A little help here. Well! What do we have here? Do I get pancakes too? Who the heck would that be on a Saturday morning? June. What are you doing here? I wanted to see the kids on my way down to Mexicali. I'm sure they'll be very excited. Dad! Hey! Hey! Is Chip here? Get in the truck, kiddo. Sweetie, sweetie, what about your pancakes? - Hey! You there! - Oh Lacy! I think she remembers me. Yes, she does. Yes, she's a good dog, yeah, that's right. All right! Have fun! Lacy, come on. You see kiddo, you can barely taste the alcohol. Go ahead and finish it. Oh my God, your dad found this killer trailer That's right across the Freeway from a water park, Supposedly when there's no traffic, It sounds just like the ocean. I want to go. Hey! So I know I haven't been the best dad in the world. What are you talking about, dad, You're the coolest. I'm going to order another drink. # Think of a place I would go # I'm daydreaming # to where the Sycamore grow # I'm daydreaming # And oh if you knew what it meant to me # And in the end so clear # Oh if you knew what it meant to me # Anywhere but here Did you see the video dad took of me on his cellphone? I was laughing so hard, my drink came out of my nose. Of course, The guy with an earring in each ear is making movies. Yeah. Who wants pudding? Bethany, it's tapioca, Your favorite. Isn't anyone going to talk to me? Oh! For Christ's sake, June, give me some goddamn pudding. Hey, sorry about that. Should use the penny. What are you doing? Nothing. What are you doing? Nothing. Did you change your mind about the sweatshirt? What? No, no. Do you want to come down and hang out or something? Why don't you come up here? Seriously? Yeah. Lacy, no. Hey! Hey! So what do you want to do? Wow! Yeah. I wish we did this before. Me too. Are you serious? Yes. # I love your face # Rosy cheeks and pale skin # Makes me feel this way # Like a little girl Lacy, Come here and give momma some love? # So far, it's not... # But it's not what they told me # Come on look sharp # The way that you feel # Give up anything to be used to this # Give up anything to be home # We have no choice but look at your face # Give up anything to be used to this Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! No fucking way! This is Jail Bait, Amber speaking. Hey! It's Bethany. What? Pruitt. I used to work there with you guys. Oh! Okay, Is Brianna there? No, she doesn't work here anymore. Oh my God! Is she going to FATI too? I don't know, I don't think so. She's having a baby so I doubt it. Okay. What do you think to start, Contemporary Auditing or Cash Flow? How about I do both? Hey, you got an extra one of those I can have? This? Yeah. Yeah. Here. How do you put it on? Here, I'll show you. Okay, so you just kind of... here, Just kind of go like this all the way around. Okay. There you go. Yeah. But what if I want it bigger and really dark And all the way around? Hey Fonzie, come here and help your grandma for a minute. I'm going to eat before I go to grandma. Give me a second already. Coming! Good girl! Hurry up, take this. Oh my God! No, grandma, I can't. It's yours, I want you to have it. It's for you. Better you than your mother. Okay, that was mean. She's going to be fine. This is for you. Go buy yourself something pretty. Jesus Christ! Talk about needing fashion school. Hey, ass-wipe, All the emo freaks belong on the bleachers. Go! What? What? You have the baloney sandwiches? Yeah. I made them with one slice each just like you like them. Thank you! Oh, remember to fill up when you reach a quarter of a tank, Okay? No less. All right, I will! And lock your doors while you're driving, Because there is no telling what kind of hustlers Can come up to your car. Okay. Well, I guess this is it then. I think so. Okay, mom, I'm going to be okay. I know you will. And you'll be too. I hope you know how much I appreciate this. I mean, I'm going to do it... All right, all right, Stop it before I change my mind. I love you mom! # Say that I'm changed. # Say that I'm different. # Maybe I finally understand # Say I let go # Say it's obvious # Well, I tell myself over, Over, and over again # I'm ready # I'm ready # I'm ready to leave # Da... da... da... # Da... da... da... # da... da... da... # da... da... da... # da... Da... # da... da... da... # da... da... # So tell me I'm strong # Tell me I'm weak # Tell me I never ever have been # And tell me I'm fine # Tell me I'm cold # Cold, I tell myself over, over, and over again # I'm ready # I'm ready # I'm ready to leave # And all the work and love # The choices you make # All the work and love # Each tiny mistake # Let the world watch # Let the world wait for you # So tell me I'm wrong # Tell me I'm cool # Tell me I fight # Tell me I fought for some things # I'm ready # I'm ready # I'm ready to leave # I'm ready # I'm ready # I'm ready to leave...
