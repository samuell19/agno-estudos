(♪ Benjamin Britten & Peter Pears: "O Waly, Waly") The water is wide I cannot get o'er And neither have I wings to fly Give me a boat That will carry two Then both shall row My love and I Oh, down in the meadows, the other day A-gathering flowers, both fine and gay A-gathering flowers, both red and blue I little thought What love can do I leaned my back up against some oak Thinking that it was a trusty tree But first it bended and then it broke And so did my false love to me A ship there is and she sails the sea She's loaded deep, as deep can be But not so deep As the love I'm in I know not if I sink or swim 0, love is handsome And love is fine And love's a jewel While it is new But when it is old It groweth cold Then fades away Like morning dew
