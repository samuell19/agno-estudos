Laith! Laith! You're only faster 'cause you're older than me. Yeah, right! The world is in shock, as a group of terrorists has succeeded in taking control of large areas of Syria and Iraq. Their leader announces the beginning of a new caliphate in the Middle East. Mosul is under Sharia law now. Ruled by the caliph of the Muslims' Abu Bakr. Whoever doesn't pay allegiance shall be burnt alive. Cut your beards, we'll cut off your heads. Any woman who doesn't abide by rules of the Sharia, shall be lashed! Laith! Breathe slowly. Slowly. I told you to stay by the house. Breathe slowly. I'll buy it for you, okay? What have we here? Interesting song, little soldier. No. He's too young. What is your name? Laith. Laith. Like a lion. Strong name. You stay out of trouble. When you get a little older, you will come and fight for the Caliphate. Come on, Laith, let's go. Open the door. We're here on Caliphate business. -Mum? -Go back inside. Go. Open up! I'm alone. It's not proper that you enter. We just need to ask some questions about your son. Remember me? Where is this Mosul hospitality I've heard about? "May peace be upon you, "O, Lady Fatima, "who has been killed unjustly." A Rafida heresy as well? Fatima. Fatima Lanrawi. Where is your husband? He's dead. A bombing? A car blew up, he was innocent! Hardly innocent if he taught your sweet boy an infidel song! No! Leave my mum alone! No, my son, don't! Stop it! You're hurting her! No! Mum. I testify that there is no God but the one God, and that Muhammad is his messenger, and that Ali is his vicegerent. Mum! No! -Get out! -Go! -Mum! -The military are closing in. -We need to leave! -Get off me! Leave me alone! Help me! Leave me alone! Where am I? You gave us quite a fright. Is he going to be okay? Yes! He'll be fine. You've been very brave. What's your name, little man? Laith Lanrawi. How do you feel now, Laith? I want her back! I led them to her. Hey. It's not your fault. They're savages. They don't need reasons to do what they do. They found a piece of paper with my mum's prayer on it. It made them really angry. Hey, you know what? Maybe you could come stay with us for a while? My grandma, she makes the best kleicha this side of Baghdad. And with you around, maybe she'll stop pestering me to get married. Here we are. She's looking forward to meeting you. Bibi! Welcome home! This is Laith. So you're the little hero then. Goodness, it's good to have you back. Let's make you comfortable. Come on. Reporting from Mosul, where a major battle broke out earlier today. Our troops have rescued many civilians including many women and children who have been transported to Baghdad for medical treatment. The leadership... Mum! What's wrong? A bad dream? They hurt her. I know. It's said some people are so full of faith, they give strength to everyone around them. A different sort of strength here. Did your mother ever tell you the story of Our Lady, Fatima, daughter to the Prophet Muhammad? Peace be upon them. I know she was a good lady. She was very special! It's a wonderful story, and it begins when Our Lady is still a little girl. People loved her and called her "the Lady of Heaven." Even back then, the oppressed were persecuted for their beliefs. For years they lived in Mecca, under pagan brutality, forcing them to flee. Brave until the end, Lady Fatima was the last to leave. Her journey across the harsh Arabian desert... ...would be the first test of her resolve on the long journey ahead. The believers followed a great man who had been destined to start a new order. To build a better future. He was her father, Muhammad. Prophet of God on Earth. Is that really him? This prophet they speak of. Why are the people of Mecca so afraid of him? They have turned Medina into a sanctuary for their people. These Muslims are bad for business. This man of God cares only for his little girl. He refuses to enter the city without her. The leaders of Mecca will never let that happen. What are you building? The future. Outside the city of Medina, he and a group of companions built a mosque. Awaiting the Lady's arrival amongst those who had followed him across the desert to a place of refuge, where they could finally live in peace and harmony. The Prophet knew the Lady's journey from Mecca to Medina would be dangerous. Their enemies would stop at nothing to prevent them from entering the city together. What did he do? He entrusted her safety to his most loyal servant, Imam Ali. Look! Ali, did you think you would get away with this? The daughter of Muhammad cannot go to her father. You must surrender. And if I do not? If you do not, we shall return to Mecca with your severed head. He cut him in half! Imam Ali had tremendous strength and power. But sometimes Imam Ali defeated evil without killing anyone. How? His heart was stronger than his hand. He had a very big heart. And if you have a heart like him, you will be victorious too. My Prophet. My Prophet! The best of tidings. They have arrived. Your daughter is here. Welcome, my Prophet. This place, Medina, will offer protection to all. Muslim, Jew, and non-Muslim. The time of oppression is over. All the tribes... All the tribes will live here as one nation in righteousness. We will help each other, support the oppressed, forgive the wrongdoers, and defend against any invaders. Everyone will have the freedom to practice their religion. Do you really think our people will be safe? Time will tell. Asylum is given to whomever requests it. No matter the tribe, no matter the religion. And this scroll bears the seal of the messenger of God, the Prophet Muhammad. And here we will be build the mosque of our saviour Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad! In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The greatest thing in this life and the hereafter is the spreading of peace in the world. All the prophets, and their successors were sent here with this goal. I am the last of the prophets. And my successors will come through my daughter Fatima, the Lady of Heaven. She is a part of me. Whoever hurts her, has hurt me. If you had a wife, you wouldn't be this messy. Well, my messy self is what keeps me alive on the battlefield. I've found someone for you, -she's very... -Very beautiful? I met her with her mother at the mosque last Friday. -I'm sure you will suit... -Suit each other so well? Morning, Laith. Sleep well? See you later. So, what do you want for breakfast? Same as him. So, doesn't Raed want to get married? All Raed thinks about is being a good soldier. Aren't all soldiers like that? Imam Ali was not your typical soldier. My Prophet... My Prophet. You know my heart is devoted to you and your message. -I have never abandoned you in... -Ali... Perhaps, you are asking for the hand of Fatima. Yes, my Prophet. Ali! Slow down. You bring up so much water, I am afraid the earth itself will run out! I cannot believe it. You are the greatest warrior of the Arabs. The bravest of them all! And you are marrying a family who cannot muster up their meal for the day. Now, if you were to marry my daughter... We are people who are happy with what God has given us. We take pride in our actions, not in our wealth. From now on, I think I will only hire warriors to work for me. Look who's here. Imam Ali. Imam. Imam Ali, the lion is here. Thank you. We hear a lady has won this warrior's heart, and this warrior needs a great dowry to impress her father? This father-in-law of yours has worked so hard to make Medina safe again. Saeed starts the bidding at 100 dirhams. I say 150 dirhams. Go on. I bid 190. Two hundred. -Two thirty. -Three hundred. -Four fifty. -Five hundred. Five hundred! Saeed wins! Now that is a very fine shield indeed. -Assalam-alaikum, Father. -Walaikum-assalam. Can I ask that my dowry be different? What is the dowry that you wish for? Intercession for sinners, so they may enter into heaven. O my Lord! They are the most beloved to me. So love and protect them, and bring their hearts together in harmony. My Lord, make them and their descendants the inheritors of Paradise. Bestow upon them a pure, blessed, and benevolent progeny, whom you make leaders guiding by your command. Greetings, Ali and Fatima. You look like a couple of stars shining in the night sky. Ali, you have the most blessed of wives. Fatima, you have the greatest of husbands. I seek refuge in you, my Lord, from Satan, for her and for her descendants. -Raed? -Stay where you are. It's okay. What happened? I don't know yet. There are huge smoke clouds. Yes, sir? I'll be there right away. Well, what's happening? They bombed Al-Karrada. I'm ordered to help control the situation. Wait. Here. Take this with you. May God protect you. I'll be back, Inshallah. Don't worry. Be good. Laith, make sure you look after Bibi. Are there any battles in our story? There is one. It's a huge one. It was only three years after the Prophet arrived at Medina. The pagans from Mecca, wanted revenge on our Prophet for the battle they'd lost the year before, the Battle of Badr. Now, Abu Sufyan's army marched to Uhud to fight them again. They come. How many? Thousands. Many thousands. Bilal, my dear friend, we must tell the archers. No matter what happens, they must understand what the Prophet told us. They must not leave their positions. The Lady wove Imam Ali a shirt, made with something stronger than any shield, the Lady's love. With her prayers, he had the best defence for the battle ahead. For the sake of the Lord you worship, I ask for mercy. Do not kill me. Onwards and kill them! With his banner fallen, Abu Sufyan's rage overtook him. He was defeated. The Prophet's commands to the archers were clear, "Stand your ground, no matter the outcome." But seeing the pagans fallen, the archers abandoned their posts. Spying a perfect opportunity, the pagans crept around the other side of the mountain, ready to ambush. Gathering their spoils, the Prophet's army was left unprotected. All for the sake of greed. Father! Do not die. No, my son. True life begins now. Listen to me. My last wish is to protect the Prophet. He is our saviour, and he shall have all my lands and groves. Father. -To the mountain! -To the mountain! Live, and pay me another day. Save yourselves! How can you abandon your Prophet? Run, save yourselves! Out of the way! My Prophet. Ask the Lord to send down his wrath upon them. Muhammad has been killed! Muhammad has been killed! The Prophet is no more. The Prophet is gone. The Prophet has left us. We must turn back to the religion of our fathers. Hearing the Prophet was dead, they lost faith, and threw down their weapons. You fools! The Prophet is alive. Do not betray him. Anyone who says the Prophet is killed will taste my blade. Where is Muhammad? Does he live? Do not answer him. This is the order of the Prophet. The Prophet lives! The Prophet lives! The Prophet lives! The Prophet lives! The Prophet lives! I think it is true. He lives. The fallen soldier had been wrongly identified. The Prophet was still alive. Abu Sufyan realised the battle was over. There was no victory that day. The Muslims hung their heads in shame. Their greed came at a high cost. The Lady was relieved to find her father and husband alive, but distressed at the sight of their wounds. She tended to them, and healed their pain. My Lord has revealed... Do not weaken, and nor should you grieve. Through this you shall be superior if you are true believers. If a wound has touched you, then know that a wound similar to it has touched the opposing people. That is how the Lord may purify the believers. Do you see that you will enter into Paradise while the Lord has not made evident those who fight in His cause, and those who are steadfast? I, Muhammad, am but a messenger. Before me, other messengers have come and gone. If I was to die, or be killed, how easily would you lose your faith? It seems like the Lord is no longer protecting him. Even in his own house, the Prophet had eyes on him. His wife, Aisha, daughter of Abu Bakr, she was consumed with jealousy. -Assalam-alaikum, my Lady. -Walaikum-assalam. My Lady, please! Allow me. Your son needs you. Did you know your father was betrayed and abandoned? We nearly lost him. I don't know how the Prophet can tolerate them. He even smiles in their faces. Smiling in the face of an enemy will save you from hellfire. Smiling in the face of an ally will allow you into heaven. There is some good news, my Lady. The groves of Mukhayreeq have produced an exceptional crop. We will get more than a fair price at market, -and the money will... -We should distribute it amongst the poor. God gives me everything I need. I learned from my father that generosity is a tree in heaven. Its branches reach out across our world. No wonder they call her the Lady of Heaven. Why do you let them talk to you like that? They are nothing but pigs and apes. Stop it, Aisha. Do not be obscene. God hates such language. It is obvious. You love your daughter Fatima and her husband more than me. And my father! Assalam-alaikum, my daughter. Walaikum-assalam, Father. My daughter, I feel fatigue in my body. Would you bring me the Yemeni cloak? The Lady's family gathered underneath her father's cloak. God declared for all to hear that the Lady's family was the most pure. Generations to come would be inspired by their goodness. God's declaration echoed across the heavens and the earth. My Lord, this is my household. Their flesh is my flesh. And their blood is my blood. Whatever hurts and saddens them, hurts and saddens me. They are a part of me and I am a part of them. So, allow your blessings to descend upon them and keep them pure through a perfect purification. Then a voice came from above. "God intends only to keep away from you the impurity of sin, "O, people of the Prophet's household, "and purify you through a perfect purification. "O, my angels and the inhabitants of my heavens. "I did not create any well-established sky, "extended land, glowing moon, "shining sun, revolving planet, "flowing ocean, or moving arc, "except for the love of these five. "Fatima, her father, her husband and her sons." What happened? Suicide bomber. Car full of explosives. A woman. But how did she get past the checkpoint? Eighty-four dead. Dozens injured. Women, children. ...was the result of a female suicide bomber who infiltrated the city by deceiving her cousin, a police sergeant, who was killed in the same blast. She detonated an explosives-laden car straight after passing a Karrada security checkpoint. Terrorist group ISIS have claimed responsibility for the attack... You okay? Reports claim that at least 84 have been killed, and 114 wounded... Why would anyone hurt their family? The Quran teaches us that sometimes bad things come from the people closest to us. This even happened to the Prophet. Thirty-four traitors plotted against the Prophet. They vowed that after the Prophet's death, they would claim back what was theirs, return to the old tribal ways and rule. A secret pact was made. The Prophet was well aware of their treachery. He could have retaliated. But it was more important for him to demonstrate to his people the values of tolerance and forgiveness. He led them on the holy pilgrimage to Mecca after liberating it from the pagans. He wanted to show them that under Islam, and even in the face of all this danger, if they believed in him, God would protect them. It was all in God's plan. As the Muslims made the journey back to Medina, the Prophet asked his believers to join him at Ghadeer Khumm for a most important gathering. God had a final message to deliver. My Lord informed me that he will call me to him shortly... My Lord informed me that he will call me to him shortly. I will leave behind for you two weighty things. I will leave behind for you two weighty things. And they will both give you guidance in the future. And they will both give you guidance in the future. The Book of God and my blessed family. Look at his eyes. There is madness there. Ali will be leader after me. My Lord guided me to appoint him as my successor. My Lord guided me to appoint him as my successor. God has blessed me with his light. God has blessed me with his light. And this light will continue... And this light will continue... ...in the 12 legitimate leaders after me descended from my line through my daughter Fatima. Ali is the chosen. He is the first and the Mahdi is the last. Whoever takes me as his leader must take Ali as their leader. This is outrageous. I'm to follow who? The husband of his daughter? This did not come from God. This is his design. If he thinks when he dies or is killed, his household will just inherit the leadership... No. Never. Truly a great day. I pay allegiance. My Imam. Blessed day. I pledge allegiance to you. Imam. You heard it from his own mouth. When he returns to Medina, Ali will take over. What can we do? See that he does not return. The Prophet journeyed back to Medina to put in writing what he had proclaimed for all to hear. But some would stop at nothing to prevent the peaceful transition of power. So he separated himself from the crowd to protect them, and took the narrower, more dangerous path. -Let us take them. -No, let them be. I have been sent as mercy to this world. I will not have it said that Muhammad is a killer of his companions. The Prophet's forgiving nature... ...did not stop them from planning to sabotage his life again. He was well aware of the continuous plots against him. When illness befell the Prophet, his orders were clear. No one should administer any medicine to him. Two traitors instigated by their fathers did not obey. Come on. In you come. -What was that? -A dangerous spider. No, I mean in the bottle. Poison. How could a wife kill her husband? Just like those spiders. Black widow spiders are known to kill their husbands. -Really? -They're poisonous too. Those spiders. Why doesn't the Prophet fight back? He has to do something. But what if he knew deep down that the best plan is to do nothing? Just to wait. Sometimes, even warriors have to hold their breath. My time is near. And afterwards, you will all face many trials. But you, my lovely Fatima, you are destined to endure the most. They will gather in their oppression of you. Sanctity will be violated. Be patient, my brother. I know you will be denounced. I know you will be challenged. But remember, whatever happens, be patient. Go to my father. Now is the time. Let him lead the prayer. Abu Bakr will lead the prayer. The Prophet commands it. Abu Bakr will lead the prayer. What has happened to him? Beware. I fear some of you are drowning... in your dissension against God. Do not split like the Tribes of Israel. Follow the Book of God... and my household. For most in his beloved city, this was a day of extreme sadness. But others saw this as their opportunity. Wait, let him speak. Wait. Let him speak. The cal... The caliphate should be ours. The tribes of Ansar are the first people of Medina. Muhammad would not have been able to establish his religion without us. Wait! But what of the Muhajireen? They will never agree. They will claim the caliphate, because they are from the same tribe as the Prophet. Then we will force them to have two caliphs. One from us and one from them. No. This will be the first sign of weakness. He is right. It will never work. Absolute power has to be the only way. We will never accept this. This is impossible. The Muhajireen will never accept this. Absolute power! Seize the caliphate! Please... No... This is a betrayal of the Prophet. The Prophet gave us Ali. Yeah, he's right. Hurry to the Saqifa. The Ansar are meeting to announce a new caliphate. Whatever we do, we must act now. I vote for two caliphs. Two caliphs. This is not the will of the Prophet. This is a coup! Just Ali. We will not pay allegiance to anyone except Ali. -Ali. -Just Ali. There is a rising against you. You know, they plan to seize the caliphate from you. Go and announce your caliphate. -If you do not, they... -I will not leave the Prophet. Two caliphs! Two caliphs! Two swords will not fit within one scabbard. Then you and your tribes must leave Medina. -And God will destroy you! -No. It will be you who is destroyed. -Get out of Medina. -Never! Get out. Traitor. Are you siding with them? Traitors. The body of the Prophet is still unburied, and you are disputing his successorship. Shame on you! Shame on you! Ali. Just Ali. Ali! Quiet! Please listen. Tribes of the Ansar, you were the first to strive for a better way. Do not be the first to change it for the worse. Tribes of the Ansar, no one can ignore your pioneering role in Islam. But we, the Muhajireen, are of the same blood as the Prophet. So, his successor should be chosen from our tribe. No, no... Affairs of the caliphate will not be run without consulting you. Join us. Join us and you will be our ministers. You. You! I agree. I swear my allegiance to you, caliph. I also swear my allegiance, caliph. This is not the will of the Prophet. I too swear allegiance, caliph. I swear allegiance, caliph. Caliph. Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr. To the mosque. Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr... You are killing my father. Kill him. May God kill him! Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr... Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr... Silence! I never asked for leadership, but the people have chosen me. If you do as I ask and pledge your allegiance to me, you will find me a fair leader. But if you choose another path, beware, for there is a devil within me. Sorry. Why don't you go and wash your hands. Lunch is nearly ready. Go on. Is it good? So, did he have a plan? Yes, Imam Ali had a plan. To test his followers, proving to them they're not as faithful as they believe. We swear by God that you are the commander of the faithful. Give us your hand, and we will swear allegiance to you and you alone. Are you sure? Prove this to me. Come back tomorrow with your heads shaved. Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Pay allegiance. Everybody else did. If you do not... you will be judged by the sword. I will pay allegiance to Abu Bakr. Caliph. Caliph. My caliph. Caliph. My caliph. The next morning, Imam Ali waited for his followers to arrive. He knew that most would fail this test of faith. Only four arrived. Master, what should we do? Go home. Please, wait. If you cannot even shave your heads, how could you face mountains of steel? There is nothing for you here. The Prophet had entrusted Imam Ali with a most important task, to compile all the chapters of the Quran and their true interpretations. Lady Fatima prepared for the birth of their child, while taking care of her husband and children. Obey me for as long as I obey God. When I act righteously, then support me. And if my path falters, then... These are lies. The Prophet told us, "Ali is our commander and my successor. "If you disobey him, your religion will be distorted." Silence! Nobody asked for your opinion. Why should we support you? Ali has greater knowledge, and he is closer to the Prophet. Repent, Abu Bakr. Do not betray the last of the Prophet's... Speak again and lose your head! Ali. Ali. I have been occupied because I have been attending to the orders of the Prophet. I have been compiling the Holy Quran, every verse and its explanation. This was the last order of our Prophet. We have our own version. We do not need yours. So, you have rejected this Quran as you have rejected us, the household of the Prophet. Imam Ali's words had moved the people to follow him again. But after his test, it was apparent they could not be depended upon, when their faith was not fully in their hearts. The path of darkness has been chosen. The whole world will become dark. Do not be deceived. Drink from the water you know to be pure, and Islam will be illuminated for you. Imam... why do you not fight back? Surely, we must fight. No swords. No bloodshed. Massively outnumbered, and their faith still unsteady, they would never win in a fight. Imam Ali's plan to preserve the Muslim nation was in action. But some still begged him for a fight. All under watchful eyes. They still gather at his house. Although Lady Fatima was pregnant, she insisted on supporting her husband's right to the leadership, calling on people to not succumb to tyranny. Sadly, they were too scared of retaliation to follow their principles. They were seen going house to house. If Ali stirs up more support, then... Ali. All I ever hear is Ali! Aren't you going to do anything at all? Yes. Of course. This problem with Ali must be resolved. Leave it to me. I will let the beast deal with him. Qunfudh. My cousin. The successor of the Prophet calls you. The Prophet did not appoint Abu Bakr as his successor. Just come to Abu Bakr. I will not pay allegiance to him. We are here for Ali! Bring him out or we will come in! I forbid you to enter this house. You did not attend the funeral of my father. Instead, you lusted after power. Your greed will be judged by God. Gather the wood, we will burn her out. This is wrong. Come on, gather the wood. We cannot do this. This is too far. You are going to let a woman tell us what to do? Finish this with as much brutality as you need. Gather all the wood and set a spark to it. Come out, Ali. Come out, Ali. Swear allegiance to Abu Bakr! What do you want from us? Why are you at the door? Because of your tyranny, you rogue. They will gather in their oppression of you. Sanctity will be violated. Be patient, my brother. I know you will be denounced. I know you will be challenged. But remember, whatever happens, be patient. Are you trying to scare me with this party of the devil? Tell Ali to face us. I have no respect for you, and I will not summon Ali for you. If Ali does not come out, your house will burn. You would burn the daughter of your Prophet? And her children? You seek to end the line of the Prophet and extinguish the light of God? Stop this foolishness, Fatima. There is no Muhammad any more, and I see no deliverance, no angels coming down from Heaven. Oh, my father, messenger of God. Look what is happening to us at the hands of Abu Bakr and Omar. You come out, Ali. Burn the house down. Burn it down! Burn it down! No. Please. You cannot do this. This is the house of the Lady, and she is inside with her children. Even so! No. Please. Move quickly. They killed our baby. Fidda! Be patient, my brother. If the Prophet did not command me to be patient and resign to the will of God, you would have never dared enter my house. Get me out of here. Take him. Defending her husband, with her wounds still bleeding, Our Lady did what no one else dared. Abu Bakr, do you wish to make a widow of me? For my children to be orphans? If you do not release my husband, I will go to the grave of my father in his bloodied garment, and I will scream to my Lord and pull his wrath down upon you all. Don't allow this punishment to strike down the people of Medina. Hurry to the daughter of Muhammad. Tell not to bring this punishment down. Do you hear me, Abu Bakr? Do you want my wrath to rain down on you? My Lady, the Lord sent your father as a mercy. Please return home. They dare to kill my husband. Please, my Lady. Ali begs you. I am sorry, Father. They took your beloved Ali away, with a rope around his neck. Did you not pay allegiance to me at Ghadeer by the orders of the Prophet? Stop this nonsense. Pay allegiance to the new caliph. Do something. This man leads a rebellion. Kill him! Please, caliph. I beg you. Show mercy on my nephew. I will guarantee. He will do what you need him to do. Ali has pledged allegiance. There is nothing more to see here. Go home. My Lady, you must see this. It was a boy. God blessed you with another son. She is a part of me. My father, messenger of God. Whoever hurts her has hurt me. What is happening to us at the hands of Abu Bakr? Get out! Abu Bakr was not at peace. He began to lash out again, demanding things he knew would hurt Our Lady. He plotted to seize all the lands of the Lady, including the beautiful land of Fadak, which had been gifted to her by her father. These lands now belong to the caliphate. No. All praise be to God who lets his word reach the hearts of the people. He created justice to allow our hearts to come together in harmony. He saved you through my father, Muhammad, and my husband, Ali. Now, with my father no longer here to lead us, the evil is with those who will extinguish the light of truth. They will return us to a time of ignorance. This new path of complicity and oppression has been set out. If you continue this way, then blood will be shed between all of you. What is all this? What, dissension? Women are but pawns of others. Some men rely on them to fulfil their own desires. No! Just like those who encourage their women to prostitution. But hark my words. Our wealth is vast under my leadership. Shame on you! Go to the treasury. Your reward awaits you. At the treasury. Abu Bakr was able to buy off the townsfolk by appealing to their greed. We have come to collect taxes for Abu Bakr. But others, spurred on by the words of Our Lady, held firm. And when local tribes received orders to pay taxes, they refused. They announced that their loyalty belonged only to the Prophet and his rightful successor. In the name of God, from me, Abu Bakr, the caliph to the Prophet, hear this proclamation. Horses! I demand you respect my command. I demand your obedience. You must obey the laws and pay taxes. If not... what you have will be confiscated. We will wipe your tribe from the face of the earth and take your women as slaves. The greatest thing in this life and the hereafter is the spreading of peace in the world. Through all this, the Lady sheltered from the baking sun under a tree. This is where she tried to heal her wounds. Abu Bakr knew this tree was Our Lady's refuge. To hurt her even more, he cut it down. During all these challenges, the Imam was her protector and comforter. He built a new shelter, the house of sorrow. Afraid that her tears would provoke sympathy, Abu Bakr and his elite alleged that the Lady's crying disturbed them. The house of sorrow was far away from them all. For 27 days, she grieved for her father, for her unborn child they snatched away. Her health decayed after the assault. Her wounds didn't heal. She knew her time was near. I despise this world that has become a breeding ground of violence. Its shadow will be cast across many generations to come. My brave Ali, when I go, no one... Not Abu Bakr... Not Omar... No one must know where I lie. Ever-living God, please help your servant, welcome me into Heaven and reunite me with my father. And this is how the Lady was buried. In secret, alone. As Imam Ali prepared her body for burial, he found her rib had been broken in the assault. She had hidden her pain from him. The people realised how much she had suffered, and how she had borne it with patience. She had won their hearts. As foretold by the Lady, for 1400 years, the direction of history shifted to oppression and tyranny. But her legacy lived on, inspiring others to stand up to their oppressors, speaking out, no matter what the cost. Just like your mother spoke out for you. My darling. My mum... I miss her so much. Her name was Fatima. Oh, dear. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. It's okay to cry. Tears are a blessing from God. We all need to cry. Jamal? You need to get out of here. Now. What are you talking about? I'm here to pray for my mother and remember the Lady. Is everything all right? What's going on? I've missed you. You left me. No, listen, I had no choice. Breathe slowly, Jamal. Slowly. -Listen. -What? Listen. Get out of here. Now! No. Jamal. No. This isn't the way. Don't let them fool you. This isn't Islam. This isn't you. -Please. -I have to do this. Jamal, no. Don't. Please. You're with me. Let's get out of here. Come on, let's get out of here. Look out. Terrorist! Show me your hands! -Show me your hands! -No, wait. It's okay. Keep your hands up or I'll shoot. Don't shoot, he's my friend. Laith. What are you doing? Step away, now. No. You don't understand. He was tricked. Show me your hands, both of you. Final warning. Keep your hands up or I will shoot. Wait. I know this boy. Laith, what's going on? Come on. Come on, get behind me. Please trust me. Trust me, he's no danger. -Come. -He's no... He's innocent. They forced him to be a martyr. Stop! Don't hurt him. He's my friend. Please... A fascinating story of a young boy who saved more than 300 souls, persuading a child suicide bomber to leave a mosque in Baghdad before detonating. The mosque attendees were shocked to find a child suicide bomber at their door, during the remembrance of the Lady Fatima. Crucial information given to the police officials from the arrested child... ...led to the capture of a high ranking ISIS commander. He is now in custody, awaiting his verdict. The real hero of the story is a young boy from Mosul, Laith Lanrawi. We heard you hugged the suicide bomber. Why? He was my friend. Why did you take such a risk? He was innocent. I thought if I could tell him the story of the Lady, he'd understand. No one ever told us. I think everyone should know the story. You were very brave. -You're stronger than I'll ever be. -No way. What you did that day, I'm sure your mother would have been very proud. I wish I could just hear her voice just one more time. I think you should take a look at this. My darling Laith. You are still so young and still learning all about life. I'm so sorry you've been taught already that the world can be a cruel and dangerous place. Take comfort from my namesake, our beloved Lady, and use her life as an example to you. Challenge those who would do harm to others, even if you're afraid. Remember to be strong like her. Your loving mother, Fatima.
