I ... Soy De Quincey. I dream, I dream. From the opium pipe, I come into me view a sailboat. Its cargo: women. Women robbed of all points the mysterious East. Your destiny and mine, humans auction in Chinatown. In 1802, Thomas De Quincey, without money or friends, came to London in search what everyone craves, And what we give different names. For some, it is a castle in Spain, or a mountain to conquer. For others, an image in a cloud smoke or sleep hidden in a bottle. About 100 years later I, Gilbert De Quincey came to San Francisco with my own search. The Chinese often say: "If a man can for one day found himself have found their place forever in the order of things. " But what you can find a when you have man himself, no place to go? However, you may have to predestined to attend an appointment. New offensive against the auction human beings, read it all! Nothing to see here, okay? Move along! When you drop the standards of the Dragon this will be a hell. Now, moving now! - Read it all! - No one will come today in Chinatown. It opens new war! New attack on human auctions! The character of a man known for their faults. That morning I could almost hear the sound of an abacus. Like an old Chinese grandfather Oceans my own accounts. Have you good health. Let the sun warm your way. Are you interested in antiques? In one especially. - Call ... "Snake Moon." - Ah! He knows his name. I've lived with it from time to time. We share the experience. - Mr. De Quincey. - Hon Ching Foon? Yes. Due on Ruby Low, She orders transmitted Ling Tan - A woman? - Ruby Low is a very beautiful woman. Take the back door, and see the house. Low Ruby is there, mourning a Chinese editor who was killed. - George Wah. - I thought it was his enemy. The more we seek our enemies, the more we take for Lambs. I see the lamb. There is a demon in the drunk and a phantom in the poet. Drunken demon and ghost and poet, was me. But for every man comes once premonition of fate. In the first moment when his image passed before my eyes, I was floating in the vastness space, and she floated by my side chains, inextricably linked ... our hands, our minds, the beating of our hearts, unable to escape, unable to separate. Sinking ... Sinking in the endless depths of time. I forgot the long sea voyage, I forgot the pain, I forgot my mission. It was the captivating perfume of incense, or a feverish fantasy dominated my brain. Whatever it was, I looked in a moment. I knew that whoever she was, or what might be. This woman was a target species for me. I'm not that woman light cigarettes. Sorry, was a boost. - You're late. Now is the time of the goat. - I think it's my time. Ling Tang is furious. Confucius said that the superior man blamed himself and less blame to others. And I, as I am much lower I decided to bring my shirt. Does your shirt? Chain mail. Yes Made in Beijing by Chen Hao. Very soft and comfortable. No knife can pierce. - When will I see Ling Tan? - Never. No one has seen his face more than a decade. I convey his orders. The message says that Hong Kong are you looking forward to work. It was ruined in the way of the Empress. Someone began to close bars at the Peninsula Hotel as if they had gone out of fashion. And, after two bottles, more or less, here I am. Maybe I should return, if is able to pay the fare. I could not pay or entry amusement park. Your friend in the coffin, might say: "There is so much poison in the mouth of the cobra, as in the heart of a woman. " Chinatown has given back Ling Tan Three of the Tongs have spoken against the sale of wives. They have stolen the best maiden last shipment. War becomes the Tongs. They are fanatics, madmen problematic. Will he cause trouble? And he was killed, Ling Tan wants you deal with the rioters. How did you do to the Chi Hon Fong in Beijing. It's strange, but he fan or not seem crazy. Not always easy to tell who is mad and who is not. - Who said it? - George Wah. The editor of the Gazette of Chinatown. He led the Chinese Tongs, trying to prevent our auctions. We explained that there are 1,000 Chinese men in the neighborhood for every woman in China. We explained that looking for a wife. George Wah did not listen. How I can send a message the venerable ancestor? Send it from here George headed home. Â¿On the basis that there should no secrets to heaven? Nor for Ling Tan They are the same in Chinatown. Does not. I think you keep a secret. Me? Tell me yourself. I'm not a Western woman. I was born in a boat that sells fruit in the river near Shu Chao. - No need to wear false faces. - I think you carry more expensive than ... than there are stars in the gutter after rain. It is long since I have chance to see me in sewers. I dare say it has a gold mirror. Although perhaps I like more the other way. Perhaps you can find out. But remember, that when they drop the banners Dragon, and when the war begins, Sometimes men come together and clouds their reflections in the sewers. CHINATOWN GAZETTE Born naked, and naked leave the world. Only the damned, the eternal fugitive, daily are separated from their neighbors, naked spirit from start to finish. In that lonely race I belong. Man is immortal, but some spend their entire existence ... as if time were eternal. This was the room of a man who had faith. A man who entered eternity. And even now he was dead, I envied him. Hush, child. Your tears will not revive the dead. We have no time to mourn. Do not leave me. I must go. You can not spend much time here. I will seek a new hiding place for you. - They will kill me. - I hit, maybe, but not kill you. Carry much opium to the auction. As before, when Ling Tan had young people around the kingdom, that the emperor could choose a wife. It was a great man then. Now it's old Not sure what the old habit is bad. Estate silent. I'll come for you at the time of the rat. When the auction starts, everyone will too busy to look. Why not make no auctions? We tried. We prevented auctions in many places. But there are evils such as herbs, never-ending. - And what is this bad? - Here the evil is Ling Tan A cancer tissue that runs healthy until they all rot. Does that mean that nobody intends to do anything to stop him? We have done everything men can make peace. George Wah took the law into their hands, and was killed for it. I have so much fear! When fortune is written or water of all rivers in the world can erase the ink. But what was described to me? In this world of fickle What can be for everyone, except to follow the path indicated? - No. .. - I will not hurt. I am looking for a bad man. No! No, please! How did you come here? - I was robbed of the mission. - What mission? - Hang Ahn. - China? I played in the courtyard of the mission when I caught two men. Had never seen. I will not see anymore the mission! I sailed along with many other girls. We sailed to an island, and there I was beaten with bamboo and with their feet. I could not escape. And said they would much opium to sell at auction. - What is your age? - 17. All my life I dreamed of America. I learned English in the mission. I wanted to come one day to America to marry. I wanted to find a man as George Wah. And today I am in this way. And George Wah is dead! No one will oppose Ling Tan! It will not stop the auction! Where are the good men? Since there are only evil men. The human concept of good and evil is like water in a tank. Open a passage to the East and east we go, open to the West and go there. Will I be up for auction? The auction will be at the time of the rat. Midnight! Too late for a boy his age. Want to help? You're a good man. I do not know how to thank you. I appreciate it deep in my soul. Save your gratitude for when we know where we go. I have much fear. A journey of 1,000 miles begins the first step. Who knows? Maybe go to where had to go from the beginning. Do not want to turn around and return. Come on. Who are you? I'm not a piece of beef in a butcher shop. It is uncertain whether a piece beef or man. It seems a man of many faces. Take the Ling Tan Tattoo You saw what I did before. I do not understand what his flag. The Hon Ching Foon, huh? Do I have to label everything? Can we not say that I am only a student of Chinese philosophy ... ... Seeking the right path? And what is the proper path? The righteousness of our surroundings, so that the eye can see, and walk forward. Good truth. George Wah met in a noble war the waiting and talking like you. - But you're late. - Guess the password, what do you expect? Ruby also hit the Low. Low Ruby is very good. For her it is very easy to bring here a man who plays both ways. And what you say. George Wah said that you spent arms to China. He liked you. But I'm not sure whether you honest. Is a risk we have to take. But do not forget that there is also a debt. George told me. While it may not be willing to collaborate because George died. War of the Tongs is very complicated, Low Ruby and compel men know to obey. George may not be the only reason that brings me here. Yes, the vast fortune of Ling Tan! The girls produce much opium. A smart man like you right side please, and earn lots of money. Is George sought fortune? He fought many battles against the auctions. He said that if prevented tonight would end all of Chinatown. But George is dead and we have very little time. Maybe it's you who must discover if a piece of beef or man. Do you think then that I trust you? I can count with you at midnight? Let's look at both sides. Â¿I can trust you with me? Yesterday, when he spoke to the girl, seemed to be his best friend. But here in his costume party, and there in your business, you look very different. My friend, you must not be confused. Good and evil go hand in hand in the path of one person. Maybe it's time to end with the philosophy lesson. And let me deal with my issues. Where is the elder? What old man? Kill! Kill! Kill! I have hungry ... Do you like beautiful singers, sir? I came from Beijing, and I know all ways to make you happy. Who are you? I am the most beautiful singer around Chinatown. I have hungry ... - Food, food ... - It's crazy. You've had a week ago. Open the door. Here's the key. - What happened? - Look Gow. Caused many problems to Ling Tan He denounced the girls who come by boat. - Open the door, please. - Why did you put in the cage? Because I'm a bad girl. Always run away from my husband. Marriage bores me. I like change. Men go crazy for me. Beautiful Chinese dwarf, very special. I dance, I play the lute, I paint watercolors ... Once they gave me $ 1,000. To be a child, have many dreams of opium. You're a girl. Once Ling So I bought for him and all hated me. Do you know him in person? One summer I called Baby Doll. It was an old man. He said I was too young to wife. I sold to a grower Salinas sprouts. I spent years cutting cabbages. - How old is Ling Tan? - Some 100 years. It is very old. What happens to this girl? There is no sense of humor. Cry all the time, husbands hate it. Where did you come? I was kidnapped from my family, do like 5 or 6 years. Lies, was his father who sold it. And why have you put in cages? When a wife dies, the man can remarry. - Would you kill? - Do not kill us. Just give us food. If they kill us, our ghosts haunt them forever. It is nice that they chase a ghost and wake up screaming at midnight. So let one die alone. That's not the ghost haunts them and sleep all night comfortable with his new wife. Many older men change wife every 3 or 4 years. Look Gow dying. Is very sick now. Not live long. It's an end. You're a handsome man. Want to see the most beautiful women Chinatown? Get ready for the big ... auction. All on sale. Come! - It all started. - How I can get? Ah! You know that girl? Do not get it. It belongs to Ling Tan is the flower of a thousand delights. When the rat will sell them all. - Show me the path. - You can not go in there. It's dangerous. Want to die in agony the 1000 cuts? I myself give to the road. - If you've been, what I give? - Your life. My life? Not that! What do I offer? If I bring to the auction room, Will you help me escape? - Do not want to die here. - I do not want to die there. I know the road. We'll go the bathroom. The Mongols will do us apart with their sharp swords. We have already died ... many times. The new girls are dirty. You have to wash them and sell them. To steal one of the girls, has to go through. The auction room is behind that door where there are men with swords. You can not go over. Maybe in two pieces, but it is useless. I know how. I'll show you how. It causes a fight between these women. You will not see you little. Ve What do you want? - A pipe. - What? No pipe here. Who would have said? So what are those? Bubbles Â¿? It's a hoax. All false. Only snuff. What are you doing? - I smoke. - There is no opium. - Why does it smell like that? - We burn incense. Go you. I'll bring. - Buying dreams tonight, sir? - I pay by nightmares. Would I then invited a nightmare? Leave in peace pipe! Did you smoke a pipe? For smoke. Like it? It seems as irresistible as you. - Do you like, mate? - I hate, man. And what has been here not like it, friend? For the auction. No white man can get the auction, friend. How long to sell wives? What do you want a wife, if you can have a pipe and dreams, buddy? Did you note, my friend? Did you notice? Should not oppose ... Do not fight. To join. It is time the dog. What you need is rest a little, and dream ... Among the dreams of the dark idol, monstrous phenomena continually developing, savages, barbarians, capricious, to immeasurable darkness, to be confined for centuries in secret chambers. De Quincey, the idol, De Quincey, the pagan priest. Be cleansed. Be sacrificed. What is the dream, and what is reality? If life can sometimes be a nightmare Can not life be a nightmare? I heard men's voices, or a strange imitation of men who emerged the jungle of my imagination. Was opium, or was this the reality? Was he dead, or just beginning to live? I escaped the wrath of Brahma through the jungles of Asia, hated by Vishnu knowing that Shiva waits, buried for 100 years with all the indescribable viscosities. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! You're very clever, but not enough. - Sorry to disappoint. - I'm not disappointed. I knew what the flower garden and willows. I know the men. All are equal in reality. All except George. George ... was my enemy. You look like George. The line between love and hate is very thin. The enemies can become lovers. George Wah said the same thing one day. But what is love? The attraction of a body by another body. Does that mean to you a man? That's all women means for man! But for a woman as Ruby Low, a man may be capable of almost everything. Snap my fingers and any man I like mine. However, it took was a snap to attract a. .. George. And killed him for it. George brought his death! It was stupid, because for a while I loved him. He thought I was weak. Do you think that would change this for some man? Do you think I risk losing the fabulous treasures of Ling Tan? Emeralds of the Lost City, Jewelry of the Ming dynasty, Lethal Weapon gold of an emperor, Opium paid in blood and human lives. This is power, fortune! I buy one army to return to China. I was born on a boat that sells fruit! Will govern a province! I have room for the Emperor's feet! - Valiente dynasty is building. - Poor slag from the beach! What can a man know as empires you? Nor about dynasties. It has no kingdoms, nor dreams, and realities. Do not own anything! For you, call the destination is to invoke the cloaca. Mine is the fate of China! I love you, Ruby. This auction, and the girls that sells ... Will it be for the destiny of China or yours? George Wah told me that once, after we had swum in ... forbidden waters. But why talk about George? George is dead. And we live. In life, very rarely happens ... ... That a man and a woman hear the call ... eternities together. It often happens in life ... a man and a woman discover the remaining half of their own beings. When I first saw you, I felt long ago, whispered in the wind together, and we lit the moon, to you and me. He is now in the Hall of the Hours Kindly me. How many hours benevolent been here? Now is the time of the rat. Have you ever woken up? Have you had good dreams? I had a horrible dream. - After the auction not have bad dreams. Will ... I know. I'll be dead. It is a fool.
