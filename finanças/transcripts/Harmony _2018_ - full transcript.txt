They say there are only two real emotions in the universe. Love. And fear. Energy so strong it binds everything. From the moment I was born, I have felt negativity all around me. I have the power to absorb the fear of others. But, it hurts. It weakens me. - Yes, I gotta go. - Good timing. - Oh, what's his name? - You tell me. I ran out of good names years ago. Oh well, I think I'll call you Pluto. Are you going out tonight? Harmony? Did something happen? You can tell me, what's going on? Uh, I keep seeing things. What things? I don't know, it's hard to explain. It's um... It feels strong and powerful. It's kind of like a, like a dark storm. You mustn't be afraid of it, child. I know but it, it really hurts. I know it does, and I wish I had the answers for you, but you need to help them, as many as you can. Hey, I've got something for you. Happy birthday, sweetie. - How did you know? - Oh, I have my own special ways. - Oh, shoot. - Oh, here. I'll take him. Oh my goodness. Ooh, I'm gonna need more cages. Bye, Pluto. Bye. Bye. - Harmony? - Mhm... Even in love, there's fear. You can't have one without the other. Want the ball, play ball. - Pass it here. - Can't get it. Okay, kid, this game, it's called keep the ball off you, all right? Oh, don't be scared, don't be scared. Don't be scared, don't you dare stop. Man, don't sound... Don't you touch me, man. Tick, Tick, Tick. - Ow! - Hey, Tick. Come on, keep movin', keep movin', faster. Get me, get me. - All right. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah! - Oh! Need to have commitment, kid. That's how it's done! Yo, Jimmy, where'd you find this place, man? It's dope, I like it. Yeah, Jimmy, where'd you find this place? Followed my gut. Pass it over here. What? Hey, Tick. Hey, kid. Kid! Hurry up! Hey, what's the matter with you? When I call you, you come. Look who's got a hope to crush. I'm gettin' annoyed with this dump. You're a good kid. Nice face paint, there. First time I ever been helped by a magician. What are you writing? A list. Of what? Questions. What kind of questions? Maybe I can answer one of 'em. I'm pretty good at stuff, you know? Give us a look, here. Why do people kiss? Well, that's an easy one. Why not? And does it make them happier? Well, it depends on the quality of the kiss. Why do people hold hands? Why can't they be happy alone? What is love? What happens if I die without kissing someone? What is love? Is love an illusion? What's your name, kid? Mason. Mason. Let's get you something to eat. Maybe I can, uh, answer some of the more critical questions, there. You're buying. Come on. You might be tired for a while, but, you can start over now. Wait, wait, wait. Here. If ever you need anything, anything, ever. What's your name? Harmony. Harmony. Oh! May I help you? No, I'm fine. Do I know you from somewhere? I don't think so. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Hey, Jimmy. I think this is our stop. You are so lucky, you know that? Thank you. Whatever. Where ya goin'? Get away from me. Shh. Don't scream. You ain't gonna scream, are ya? Please. Please, don't hurt... Whoa. What was that? That was incredible! Hey, sh... sh... she doesn't look so good. I'm g... g... gonna go help her. Hey, kid. Where you goin'? L... l... let me... go. She n... n... needs my help, okay? Just sit and wait. For what? Trust me. It'll be fun. Ain't it always fun with me? Come out, come out wherever you are. Look, freshy, this is where your girlfriend lives. Huh? Take a look. Where the hell is she? She must have gone back out. What a shithole. Hey, yo. Did you guys feel that? Weird, right? Hey, she ain't here. Let's go play some ball. Not yet. Check it out. Oh, shit. Hey, hey, come on, I'll go toe to toe with you. I'll beat you this time. I said not yet. How can I help you, Mr... Miller. Oh. Ah. Mr. Miller. It's a very bad time right now, so, how can I help you? Today's my birthday. I was born here. Congratulations, and I wish you a very happy birthday. Unfortunately, we're not in a position to be handing out gifts. I'm a little tied up right now trying to work out where I'm going to transfer all my patients because apparently, someone is trying to turn this into a block of condos, so, please, how can I help you? I'd like you to write me a list of everything you need and want for this hospital. Excuse me? A list. Of everything you need, everything you want. I'm gonna be taking care of all the bills from now on. Who are you? Is this some kind of joke? Not at all. While you're doing that, if you don't mind, I'd like to do some magic tricks for the kids. I'm not very good. Sure. Hello. Oh, hi Mason. - It's me, it's Mom. - Hi. I'm sorry, I just, I went away for a while. I... I had to. Where'd you go? Just away and, - but I'm better now. - That's good. There was a girl, she helped me, and uh, I'm having some people over the house tonight and I would really like to see you. Can you come? Okay. See you then. I love you. Molly, it's me. Molly. Hello? Hi. It's Harmony. Harmony, oh my God. Is everything all right? I'm scared to go back home, 'cause it's all gone. Did someone hurt you? Um, do you know somebody else that I could help? J... just... Where are you? Let me come and get you. No, I... I can make my own way. Harmony. Oh my God. Come in. There's a lot of people here. I can ask them to leave if you want. - No, it's okay. - Okay. There's a room upstairs. It's yours as long as you want. You look better. I am, thanks to you. Come on in. I... I've invited a couple over. I was hoping you could spend some time with them. I hope you don't mind. Yeah, sure. Good. You don't understand. My father gets what he wants when he wants it. Should never have bought it. And besides, it's ugly and old. Have you ever been inside? Is everything all right? Yeah, I just uh... I feel really strange. Well, what is it? What's wrong? I don't know, it's different. Mason. Don't turn away from me. What was that? What? Well, what is it? What's wrong? Mason, you're acting very strange. Excuse me. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Mason. I'm Harmony. Mason, this is the girl that I was telling you all about. And Harmony, this is Mason, he's my son. Oh, just going to go and get that. Like your shirt. Excuse me. Sorry, did you want some? Sorry, what? Oh, have you tried these? These are incredible. I am... I'm so... sorry. I... I don't... I don't know what... I'm so sorry. Mason, Harmony, this is Eliza and David. This is the couple I was talking to you about. So nice to meet you. Beth told us what you did for her. How, how does it work? Is there somewhere private we can go? Oh, sure. We'll go upstairs. - Be back in a minute, dear. - Yeah, that's fine. You guys go upstairs. I'll just be here until you get back unless I have to go to the bathroom. I had a, we... We had a question. Will I forget her? No. What'll happen? You just won't feel the pain anymore. Okay. Are you ready? Yeah. Yes. Are you okay? Hi, I'm Tracy. Nice shirt. And you are? I'm Harmony. - I have to go. - Yeah, I think that's probably a good idea. I'm sorry, I have to go. Mason? Mason. Where is she? Did she go? Are you all right? What's going on? Just, I need you to tell me everything you know about her. Oh. Okay. Mason? I... I stuffed food in her mouth. For God's sake, what was I thinking? Mason, that is the most normal I have ever seen you. - What is that? Is that Harmony's jacket? - Yeah. Molly. The strangest thing happened to me last night. Uh, I was at this party and... You. Well, I didn't get to say goodbye last night. How do you know where... Oh, you're, - you left this at the party. - Oh. Well, you two look like you can do with some "chat time". He's cute. Wait, Molly, wait. Look after our guest for me. Wait, Molly. Look, um. Thank you for bringing my jacket back, but, I think it's... How many animals have you got here? - Around 50, I guess. - Really? And you and Molly, you take care of all of 'em? It's mainly Molly. Look, what I'm trying to say is that... Incredible. What is? You. And Molly. You're incredible. How did you two meet? I don't know, she sort of found me one night, I guess. That's so cool. So, where do you wanna go? What do you mean? Anywhere. I'm here to take you there. I can't just leave. It's a really quiet day. I can manage alone. You should really go out for a while. Look, you don't understand... Got it. I know. I... I can take you to a room with the best view. Did not mean it like that. Not at all, that's not what that, that is not what I meant. I didn't say that right. There is a view, but there is no room part. I'm sorry. I've had a bit of a word problem since yesterday, actually. Harmony, a word? Can you just excuse me... Yeah, I'm uh, gonna sit down and read this amazing magazine, Feline Fancy. You just, you just let me, you just let me know, does that sound okay? Sure. - What are you doing, girl? - What's he doing? I think there's something wrong with him. Look at him. He's just sitting there reading. Yes, he is waiting for you. Do you know how rare it is to find a man who is willing to sit and wait? Trust me, it's very rare. Now, look at me. This is a moment. You need to get your ass out there and enjoy it. Now, whoever he is, you can touch, right? Mmm hmm. Um, I can't. Look at him and look at me. You need to get out of this room and go out and enjoy yourself before I throw you out. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - Here. - Not I ca... Yes, you can. Now, you go on out there and get going. Go, girl. Hey. Shall we? Oh, oh, before I forget. You also left this at the party. Thanks. Molly. It is, uh, it has been an absolute pleasure and I hope to see you again sometime. Well, you make sure to look after my little angel. Of course I will. In fact, I can call you every hour if you need me to. Actually calling's probably silly. I'd probably just text you 'cause if I call, if I'm always calling you, then you're not gonna get anything else done. We wouldn't want that, 'cause obviously there's a lot - you've got to do here. - Yeah, get out. Okay, thank you. I think I just met one. It's starting. Oh here. Put these one. Why? To protect it. Check this out. Is this place yours? It was built in 1892. It's in its original condition. Look. This telescope is currently pointed at a galaxy called EGS8, which is 588 million years old. Based on expansion versus time, that's only about four percent of the age of the universe. God, there's so many. One billion trillion, actually. Some quantum researchers believe that everything in the entire universe is connected by this thin web. It's billions of times smaller than an atom and, any time anything happens, no matter how small it is, even a thought, it can be felt across billions of stars. Every emotion, every heartbeat, everything. I hope you don't mind me asking, but, what did you do to Beth? You don't have to answer that. Oh no, it's okay. I helped her get back to how she was before. Like a, like a reset switch. Does it hurt you to do that? Water helps take it away. Water? So, you can literally like, wash away... pain or fear? So, the other night, when we met, was that happening to me? Were you taking something from me? When we touched, it was, it was weird, I didn't... It all stopped. I didn't feel it from anyone. Is that a bad thing? No, it's just, strange, you're strange. I mean, I don't think that you're strange... No, no. I didn't take it like that. I mean, I'm not the one with the incredible gift. But you're definitely not normal. What is with that? That is so weird, right? I mean, I don't know that I'm doing that. I mean, now what do I do? I mean, I don't wanna let go, 'cause then you're gonna think that I don't wanna hold your hand, which... I'm just so confused. Oh, I've got an idea. You said when we're touching, you can't feel anyone, right? So, have you ever been in a group of people before? I need you to write me a list. Of what? Everything that you couldn't do because you were scared. Oh no, I can't. Don't think about it. Just write. This one. We can do that right now. Come on, come on. Where are we? You'll love it. It was my friend Eve's idea, but we started it together. Eve was adopted like me. She was going through some hard times, so I helped her and this is what she wanted to do. She wanted to create this place where people could go and be themselves but not take any drugs or alcohol, you know? Just have fun. I'll be right back. Mason! Happy Birthday! This is Harmony. Hi. I'm Eve. Hi. I really like your place. And it's all thanks to this guy. You're up. Hey, this is Mason. He's the one who saved my life and this is Harmony. I know who you are. You're an angel, just like him. Happy Birthday, partner. It's your birthday. It was yesterday. Mine, too. Really? You ready for this? I promise, I'm not gonna let go of you. Just close your eyes. I haven't done this before, either. We can do it together. - I'm sorry. - For what? Is it what you expected? Hey, do you like waffles? - I guess. - Okay. I'm gonna take you to the best waffle joint in this city. Now, close your eyes. And, open them again. Ah. Great. Well it's, it's normally a lot smoother than that. No, it was very impressive. Uhm, ho... how long did it take you to learn that? I been workin' on it for a couple of months. It's just so hard with a waffle, because they're so... waffle-y. Hey, where did you get that? I just shaped it out of a piece of metal. That is just crazy weird. I got you something. It's just to remind you how bright it really is out there in the darkness. Here. It's nothing. I love it. Just here's fine. Actually, wait. Two things. One, did you have a good night? Two, can I see you again tomorrow? If you like. Cool, it's a big yes, then. Uhm, okay well, can I have your number, please? I don't have one. That's very cool. Okay cool, I'll uh, I'll give you this. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Thanks. What are you doing? Uh, nothing. Well, something. I don't know. Just feels really weird to drive away from you. Well, you're gonna stop the traffic. Oh, you're gonna stop the traffic. Come on, go. Go. - Night. - Night. Harmony. Mason! Hello? Harmony, it's Beth. Something's happened to Mason. Go get Rusty. - How's his heart rate? - Irregular, I'm not getting a beat. We're just giving him a sedative to calm him down... - No, don't do that, don't... - Do it. Heart rate regular. Harmony. Hey, you're not allowed in this room. Get outta here! No, Harmony, stay. I can't. - Harmony! - No, don't go. You can't be around me. No one can. Harmony. Let go of me. Let go of me! Harmony! Harmony! I can't do it anymore. No. Mason, don't say that. I've watched you struggle your entire life, Mason, just to fit it. I don't know what Harmony has done, but she has unlocked something deep inside you and you are connecting for this first time and it's perfect and it's pure and connecting, Mason, it's gonna hurt. Sometimes, sometimes you feel like your heart is gonna burst with love, with fear and you get angry and you get sad and you get scared and you get happy. The whole thing is so beautiful because that's life and this is gonna be your life, your new life. My beautiful son, you're everything this world needs. It's your one chance at love. Find your love, find your fear, own it because they're yours. You gotta get up and you gotta go and find Harmony. Hey Jimmy. What are you thinkin'? I think it's time the kid got initiated. - Whoa. - Shit, you hear that, freshy, huh? Gettin' excited, huh? Get excited. Sound good to you? What, what do you want me to do? I think it's time we paid a little visit to your girlfriend. Who? What for? I don't know. There's just somethin' about her that's got me... curious. I don't know, man, I mean. Hey, kid. Where's the love? Trust me. You're gonna have a blast. Come on. Sure, Jimmy. I just gotta take a piss real fast. Harmony! Harm... Mason. What's wrong? What's happened? - Where is Harmony? - I don't know where she is. Something is happening to us. Just calm down. Just take a breath. Just breathe, honey. That's it, just breathe. Good. Now, I don't have the answers you need, Mason. But, I think my sister does. You're so tall and handsome. I told you. What happened when you touched? She feel it from the others? How'd you know that? Here, come here. Sit down. Now. I raised her, Mason. You were born on exactly the same day in the same hospital as Harmony. Your bond with her started the day you were born. What's happening to her? To us? I need you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment and listen very carefully. Can you do that? Imagine a world that was suffering an ever growing abundance of negative energy, a world where pain and suffering, anger, fear, sadness and depression was building, was manifesting itself into a storm. And to balance this energy something was sent to fight it before it was too late. Harmony. Yes, and you. The day you were both born. Five babies all with dying mothers, all in one place. You were the tipping point. Tipping point? Tipping point to what? She's an anomaly, Mason. Her birth is the counterpoint to all this growing negative energy and she did something to you to protect you from this energy until the time is right. But Harmony's journey is different to yours. She's being tested. The day she ran away from me was the beginning of her extraordinary journey, one which I had to let her take alone. Sorry, you... You left her alone. And she's been suffering every night with no one to help her and now what? You want me, you want me... You want me to sit here waiting knowing that she's out there. I just need... I need to know where she is. I don't know where she is. The gift she gave me was a glimpse into the path ahead. Letting go of Harmony was the hardest thing I ever, ever had to do. But she took away my fear, too. And that allowed me to let her go. And besides, she's not alone. She never has been. All this time. Well, not all this time. Till the right time. But... What has she done to me? I feel like my heart is gonna explode. That I can explain. This is you, and this is Harmony. Child, to find her, you need to look at your past and present, all of it, what you've achieved. What you have and what you've been given. Look for the patterns. Your connection with her is perfect, you just need to listen to it. And go back to the very beginning, Mason. Feel it. Hey, wait, wait, wait, stop. Listen to me, listen to me. Whatever you have, whatever you do, he wants it. You... you have to get outta here, okay? He's lookin' for you. You have to run. I can't. Please go. Admin. Sarah, hi. It's Mason. - I need you to do me a big favor. - Sure. - I need some details from the day that I was born. - What are we lookin' for? Were there any other babies born on the same day as me? Yeah, there were five, no, no, six actually, by the look of it. - That's unusual. - What is? All the mothers died in childbirth and no fathers registered. You were all orphans, and there was one baby, she was a Jane Doe. Is there a Harmony? No. Harmony? Who's she? It's nothing. Hey. Hey, newbie. Where'd you run off to? How was your little chat? Hope it was meaningful. Heartfelt. You're gonna leave her alone. Look who's lost his stutter. Special, isn't she? Can see that now. This is so awesome, huh? You're going to leave her alone. She did something to you, didn't she? I can see it in your eyes. It seems you're not enjoying our company as much as I'd hoped. That's a pity. And you liked her so much. I thought you'd like to be a part of tonight's activity. Oh well. I ain't afraid of you anymore. Hmm. That's okay. I can fix that. Hello. Look for the patterns. Feel it. What did you do to him? Who? Oh, the kid. Yeah well, unfortunately, he couldn't be here, but he wanted us to say hi, so uh, hi. This is Tick. This is Ben. And my name is Jimmy. Get away from me. Hey yo. I ain't so sure about this, man. I am. You don't know what you're doing. I think I do. See, it's really hard for me to explain to you, but, I can literally feel it in my bones. Yo Jimmy. Can you feel that? What the hell is that? It's her. I'm serious. I think we should leave it. Shut up. I can see you. Yeah? What can you see? What can you see? Tell me. Tell me what I am. Here. I'll help you. Oh, please. Jimmy, Jimmy, you all right, Jimmy? Whoo! Oh, shit. Something's coming out of her fingers. Check that shit out, man. That shit ain't right. I don't feel so good. Hey, Jimmy. What the hell is happenin', man? Answer him. There's, there's too much in the room. What's in the room? Be more specific. Don't come in here. Don't, Mom. Yo, I didn't mean it. I didn't mean for it to happen like that. You should've stopped me, man. Why didn't you stop me? I'm so sorry. What's in the room? Fear. Oh shit, I didn't mean to push you. I didn't mean to push you, Mom. You should've stopped me. Why didn't you stop me, man? Oh no, oh no, they do not look so good. Please just make it stop. Stop, please. Please, just stop. Why won't they listen to me, man? Nobody ever listens to me. Mom, I promise you. Why? won't they listen to me? Ah, yeah! This is fantastic! You're gonna, you're gonna kill them! Me? Oh no, no, no, don't you blame me. I ain't doin' nothin'. This is all on you. So, clearly, you're not normal. Question. Can you stop a bullet? Loud, aren't they? You know what the difference between them and me is? I love this shit. Whatever you did, whatever demons you put in their heads, I've already met mine. I talk with them every day, and they like me because I'm a team player. Harmony! Oh, good, we have a guest. Mason, run! Let her go! Let her go! Kinda love the optimism. One day it won't be about the fear of others, Harmony. It will be your own, and when that day comes, stare deep into its darkness, call it for help, and embrace it. All those you have helped, all those you have saved, let them guide you. Mason, no. Stay away from me. I know everything. It's too much. I can't, I can't take it all. No. Look at me. Stop, Mason, stop. You are not alone anymore. No, no. I'm not? Jesus. Mason? Help. Come quickly. Get away from me! Mason. - Mason! - No, no, get away! Help! Don't touch me! - It's, it's Mommy. - No! Mason. No! Mason. Please let me... No! Mason, I need to be able to help you. You want some water? I've got some. Harmony. Every time I try to touch him, he screams. He keeps asking for water. What's wrong with him? He tried to help me. We need to help him. He's all I have. Please. I need him. Thank you. I need to be alone with him now. When this is over, can you tell him, can you tell him I said thank you. Thank you for showing me. Harmony. Hey. Harmony, hey, hey, hey. Wake up, come on. Harmony! Harmony. Oh, jeez. Mason. Harmony. Just wake up. Come on, Harmony. Just wake up. I'm so sorry. I just, I just need more, I just need more water, that's all. It's over, Mason. It's just not enough, that's all. - It's over. - It's not enough! Love and fear. I know love now. There are five of us, and I am not alone anymore. But there is still so much fear in the world. It's out of balance and we need to find the others to fight it.
