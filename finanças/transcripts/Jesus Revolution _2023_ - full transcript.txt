The words peace and love are used by them often. These kids call themselves hippies and represent a new form of rebellion against the status quo - [charlene coughing] - And the so-called materialism of their parents. - Charlene: Gregory. - Their message to the world, "turn on, tune in and drop out." ♪ I just want to celebrate yeah, yeah ♪ another day of living, yeah ♪ I just want to celebrate another day of life ♪ had my hand on the dollar bill ♪ and the dollar bill flew away ♪ but the sun is shining down on me [door opens] Newscaster: We can't relate to our families.

The clothes they wear, the way they preach love as opposed to hate, peace as opposed to war. These beliefs set them up as rebels against a materialistic, square, old-fashioned society. Reporter: [On TV] Everywhere young people were turning on, dropping out. The hippies, pot, speed, acid. Alcohol seemed to take a back seat. Janette: You guys stare at that thing like the world is ending. I think the world is ending. Janette: Well, I think what they're doing is kinda beautiful. Kay: Honey? Are you doing drugs? No, mom, I'm not doing drugs. Please stop asking. Look, what I'm saying is that they want peace and love. Isn't that the same thing you want? I think these kids need help. What they need is a bath. I don't know if they can be helped. Janette: See, and there's the problem. You're passing judgement on people you know nothing about. You've never even met a hippie. Thought they didn't talk to squares. Didn't you say I'm square? Dad, you are the very definition of a square. I'll tell you what, when god walks in here, brings me a hippie, I'll ask him what it's all about, because I do not understand. Maybe that's why your church is so empty. Kay: Where are you going?

[Chuckles softly] I like the sound of that. [Chuckles softly] You know, it reminds me of the words of Jesus. "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? "What are they like?" I was up in San Francisco for a long time. Living in haight-ashbury, on the streets, all over. And we did everything, and everyone. But that was the point. You see, the drugs, it's a quest. [Gentle music playing] For what? For god. How can you not see that? There is an entire generation right now searching for god. Timothy: Everyone is accepted here. We love each other freely and without discrimination. There are no facades. No lies. No masks. Just a relentless pursuit of the truth by those who have expanded their consciousness. Man, we thought acid was gonna save the world. - Thank you. - Kay: Mm-hmm. Thanks, mom. Lonnie: But that was a lie. As much of a lie as what we were rebelling against. And what brought you to that realization? I kept searching and searching, and I just finally got to the end of it. And there was still a void. And my people, well, they're a desperate bunch. And "desperation", man, there is power in that word. What would it take for you, Chuck Smith, to be desperate? Timothy: The psychedelic experience is a confrontation with the divine. It's a spiritual awakening. And you come back and you define god the best you can. So, turn on, tune in, - and drop out. - [Audience cheering] Start a new sequence of behavior that matches your vision. [Cheering continues] Be reborn.

[Chuckles softly] I know we must seem pretty strange. But if you look a little deeper, if you look with love, you'll see a bunch of kids that are searching for all the right things just in all the wrong places. So, to answer your question, how do I describe my people? They're sheep without a Shepherd chasing hard after lies. And the trouble is, your people reject them. So, I ask you, pastor, "how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard?" We can only walk through doors open to us. And your church, well, that's a door that's shut.

[Hippies laughing] I was reading in the book of acts, and I think it kind of explains what's going on in haight-ashbury. See, god says, "I will pour forth my spirit on all mankind. "And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. "And your young men shall see visions. "And your old men shall dream dreams. "I will, in those days, "pour forth my spirit."

Welcome to church. - Woman 4: Thank you. - Hello, young lady. Well, last year, I had the privilege of visiting, uh, New York City. And like any other tourist, I paid a visit to the statue of Liberty, and I read those famous words. "Give me your tired, your poor, "your huddled masses, "yearning to breathe free." And as I read those words, I thought, well, that's christianity, isn't it? [Chuckles softly] I mean, it's the essence of it. An invitation to the broken. Jesus was very friendly with the outcasts. In revelation 22, it says, "let the one who can hear say, 'come.' "let the one who is thirsty come. "Let the one who desires "take the waters of life freely." I want you all to look at me. Uh... Please. Every one of you. This place, it is yours. [Chuckles] I don't... I don't care if anybody else thinks so. [Chuckles] If... if you feel like you're an outcast... Then join us here. If you feel like you're misunderstood and judged, this is where you belong. If you feel ashamed or trapped in something you've done or are doing, you will find forgiveness and freedom... Right here. No guilt trips. [Hippies laughing] This is your home. And I want you to tell all your friends about it. There is a place for you. Now that door is open all the time for you. Any time of day. And if there are some who don't like that, well, then, that door is open for you too. It works both ways. [Gentle music playing] [Door opens] [All clapping] All right, pastor. Let's begin. - [All chuckle] - Let's begin. Hey, Chuck. You're gonna need a bigger church.

We're losing our girl to the dark side, and you're not even... What are you looking at? That was really far out. [Chuckles] The magic bus is leaving in seven minutes, folks. I'm really glad to be here. Really, all I got to bring is what the Bible calls the good news. So, this is what you've been trying to figure out? Lonnie: In the gospel of Matthew... - Yeah. Mostly. - Lonnie: Jesus said, "come unto me all ye that labor. - There's this, um, church. - Lonnie: "...And are heavy laden...

And it's happening right here in my church, calvary chapel. I've really been building it up. God has chosen himself some unexpected prophets. Are you one of those prophets, Lonnie? Well, I told god to use me, and he sure is using me. So I would say, yes, I think so. Kathryn: I think so, too, Lonnie. Reporter: [On TV] As the Jesus movement continues to work its way from the haight-ashbury in San Francisco to southern California, the question many people are asking is whether the Jesus people are a new religious group or a cult? Critic: [On TV] That's the trouble with haight-ashbury. We need more ministers down there preaching that these kids can clean up. I'm tired of these Bob Dylan preachers who go around the streets telling these kids that they can have all this and Jesus, too. They're not preaching the gospel. We have a church that is permissive, total breakdown of discipline... - Lonnie: Riverside? - Disrespect for law and order. I don't get it. We already have our own Wednesday night service.

[Chuckles] Come to find out, Jesus came in with them. And you know what? I'm proud of you. You opened yourself up to something you didn't understand. And I'm changed because of it. Thousands of us are. But you don't have to carry it all, okay? Don't lose yourself in all of it. Okay. [Chuckles, sniffles] Also, don't do drugs. [Both chuckling] [Imperceptible] [Birds chirping] Chuck: Thought I might find you here. Do you mind? So I recently heard about this little church up in riverside. Pretty near that place where you did that Bible study. And it seems that their leadership had an issue about something and ended splitting up. They took everything. They left an empty, abandoned building where a church used to be. Seems a shame, doesn't it? But that's what people do sometimes. They lose sight of what's important. Fortunately, god has a long history of using flawed people. I'm sorry, son. I didn't stand up for you when I should have. I was wrong for that. Thank you. So, what happened to that church? Oh, I bought it. This morning. It's like an empty canvas. Seems perfect for an artist like you. [Gentle music playing] You want me to work there for you? It's not my church. It's yours. This movement started at calvary, but it can't stay here. So, go build something great. I don't know what to say. Say yes. Yes. [Chuck chuckles] Pastor Chuck... I don't think I can ever do what you do. Chuck: No. You'll do better. Man: Hey, man. Hey, sorry to bother you. Is this the beach where people get baptized? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Pirate's cove. Cool. My friends and I heard about it on the radio and drove all the way here. Where from? Texas. We wanna get baptized but didn't know how or when... How about right now? [Enthralling music playing] Amen. Amen. [Knocking on door] Greg: Good evening, sir. Um, I know that you don't like me very much and... She's in the dining room. Oh. Okay. I didn't see that coming. Go ahead, son. Hey. Hi. Hi, Greg. Hi. Good evening. Sorry to barge in so late... I, uh... [Chuckles nervously] I did not know how wet I was until just right now. And your hardwood floors. Oh, I'm so sorry. Cathe: And you're not wearing any shoes. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not. You're right about that. But I just gotta tell you something. I've been really stupid lately. Obviously, you know that. I'm sure you've heard. I am so sorry that I pushed you away. And I hurt you. It was so dumb. It was really dumb. - Really dumb. - It really was. The dumbest. Yeah. But I wanted to ask you if you still mean what you said the other day about what you want with us. Because I got really big plans, cathe. Hopes and dreams. I've got goals. And I wanna do it with you. Together. You and I. Because I get you. I need you. I want you. And I... "Love you"? Yeah. Like, a lot. [Chuckles] And so, what? What is this? Is this your way of proposing to me? Oh. Um... Um... Uh... [chuckles nervously] What would you say if it was? I would say... That if you ever get in the way of me and god it's over between us. So, is that your way of saying yes? Yes. You're so wet. I'm so wet.

Seems the movement's everywhere. Los Angeles. Vegas. Even in the south. Alabama, Georgia, Florida. - It's spreadin' like wildfire. - [Cathe chuckles] "Revolution." wow. - I like that. - Cathe: Me too. You know, the first time I saw Josiah, he asked me if I thought this was the beginning of something or the end. Feels to me like the beginning. Let's see what god has in mind. [Uplifting music playing] [Imperceptible] Reporter 1: The Jesus movement is no longer a California fad. It's a song-singing, hand-clapping, full-fledged, old-fashioned revival that's sweeping the country. The converts are young people who are turning to Christ as their personal savior. Reporter 2: Their meetings, for the most part, are not inside the established churches. Man: Jesus loves you. Every last one of you. I don't care what color you are, he loves all of you just the same. Reporter 3: More than a quarter million youths have converged on Dallas, former hippies among them now known as Jesus freaks. We're told it could very well be the largest Christian youth gathering in the history of america. Billy Graham: This is a Christian happening. It's a demonstration of the love of god by tens of thousands of young people to the world that are saying to the world, "god loves you." It's the Jesus revolution that is going on in this country. ♪ Hey!
