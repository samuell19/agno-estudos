He told me the other day There is an elephant in Manzhouli It sits there all day long Perhaps some people keep stabbing it with forks Or maybe it just enjoys sitting there I don't know People gather there, watching it sitting still They feed the elephant food but it takes no notice He told me that before What did he say? You are stepping on my pants What did he say? Same thing Give me some water What's the smell? Who opened the freaking window? I'm closing it now It's too late! Now the apartment is stinky! A lousy day starts again! It's the kitchen window What? The smell comes in through the kitchen window No one cleans the garbage down there It's much better than your bedroom! The dumpster smells better than your nasty room! Where's my gift card? No idea You used it the other day. Where is it now? Check the cupboard It's not there Well, I don't know He stole it I didn't You gave a 20% off to customers at the supermarket You then spent the kickback at Internet cafés!

You picked it up on the street School district housing is triple the price of normal housing Of course it's not necessary But our daughter will go to a less qualified school She might be bullied I can't watch my kid going to the terrible high school where I'm working So school district housing is the only option for a better education Your feet But our money can only afford a small school district apartment Keep it tight We can't all move in There's not enough space That's why we want to send you to a nursing home You always think we want to abandon you that way Your instep Why do I have to stretch in the morning? Frequent training makes you a good dancer They say I'm good enough You can do better What for? Straighten up your back The school forbids us to tutor students outside My own student told on me once Private schools don't have these restrictions But it offers no welfare guarantee either It's not an iron bowl in the long run Hold on It's possible to transfer to a branch school but takes a lot of effort Our school acquired a private school and founded this so-called branch school The pay is good but it sounds less decent I'm still thinking about it Shoulder Good Shoulder Good. Good, go on I can't keep my dog at nursing homes I can't go there OK, I understand Let Grandpa help me with the stretching. He's good at it Concentrate Dad, please be more considerate She doesn't even have a place to do her homework She can't always write on your sewing machine This is my apartment Dad, please stop We didn't mean it that way This is not the first time you brought it up We are not forcing you I saw your mother What happened?

It's me I forgot my shoes They are in the cabinet Somebody else is home? No Why are you back? I'm picking up my stuff Are you leaving? What? Or are you staying home? Those are your shoes? Yes The water is leaking in the toilet! The toilet is leaking! What? The toilet is leaking again. It's all flooded You did it? It's the third time Call someone to fix it or use a basin, OK? Your cake is there You stepped on it? No I bought it for you and you crushed it? No, I didn't I walked two freaking miles There was no 24-hour bakery store around I told you I didn't step on it! Where's my contract? Find it and read for me You hear me? He wanted to beat up Yu Shuai But ended up kneeling down by the river, singing a lullaby How did you know? I was on the other side Keep rolling Do you have it on you? I didn't take it Yes but you stole it No, I did nothing Everyone else's stuff was right over there Why were you there? You don't play basketball You thought you could fool me? I didn't steal it. I have my own phone What did you see? Stay the hell out of it He's useless Why not call you Grandpa.

You go wherever you're supposed to go And you? Me? I'll have a new office in the new school. Larger, more comfortable You guys will go to the worst high school in the city When you graduate, most of you will become street food vendors Keep the money Have some fun at the Internet café Why are you so positive about your future? Tell that mopping boy to come in Vice dean asked for you The world is a wasteland What? A quote from this book. I'm moved You are... moved? Did you pay for the desk? For History class? Yep Why don't you go inside? Wanna stand for a while Do you want to meet me later this afternoon? Where? Monkey park I can't. I have other things What things? You don't have anything to do? Why always go there? I've got my own business as well Like what? Feeding monkeys? No You shouldn't have messed with Yu Shuai He has a brother. Everyone knows that His brother can kill you That'd be perfect What do you want? I've seen worse. They didn't force you out of your home yet I know the place I know the place Tolerable food, TV sets But you have to smoke secretly My old badminton fellow is there Why ask? You're bored at home? I thought your granddaughter is close to you Mister Have you seen a big white dog? It's white, huge, like this big, and long hair. Have you seen it? No. I saw it Running north North where? Towards that bridge Are you able to look after the kid? They won't allow me My hands tremor sometimes Then you are useless to them I bet you have to leave anyways They won't even pay for your residential fees if they're not happy The police came You know what it wasn't because of me He bought this apartment because you made him do it He had a lousy pay What else can he do with that pay? So he jumped off the building I don't care what you think It was his own decision. I'm not guilty He was paying for your vanity You're the one who should've jumped off I can't believe I'm talking to you about this Did anyone ask about it? They'd better not ask Or I'll tell them it was you that pushed him off Why do you look so sad? Because he's dead? Because I'm heartless? Or all the problems coming up? They called his Mom She has booked a flight She will come to you You were his only friend Understood? You gave him the money? He didn't take it He said our school is closing How come? He said we're going to be street food vendors No. He lied to you I know But I think it makes sense What were you doing with Huang Ling? She said Yu Shuai's brother could kill us You have the balls to come with him? Tell me your thoughts He didn't steal it You were not there But I know he's not a thief But my phone is missing Maybe someone else took it Maybe your Dad took it What did he take from my family that got him fired? Did he bribe you? So you stand up for him? Be careful. The school might kick you out as well So you can stay home with Daddy Fine. I'll buy you a new phone Buy your ass! What about my old files? Let him buy one. Give him an out Shut up. They asked for it We did nothing How do you want to end this? You two sing a lullaby on your knees Buy me a new phone later No way You think you're the boss?

I don't know what to do It's none of your business Time for class Go back to your seats You know what happened? Not the fighting part You two are close? Just fine Why did Wei Bu beat up Yu Shuai? Yu Shuai believed that Li Kai had stolen his phone Wei Bu tried to help him out Can't be that simple That's all You're asking as if you care Because it would get me involved The boss would ask me about it In the end it's always my business Students' problems are my problems If you stay out of it, nothing will change I know But I'll get into trouble Things work like that If anything happens, everyone gets into trouble But we keep running into troubles We have to close down the school early today Last night my Mom...

Group chat. They have nothing better to do The school didn't call the police. Why? The fight? Better settle it privately Yu's family has a car dealership Settling it privately is the best way out, for Wei Bu or for the school His brother is looking for Wei Bu That's fine Wei Bu hit him He has to pay for that Nothing serious What do people make of things happening to them? What do you mean? I don't think Wei Bu knew what he was doing He surely didn't When I was at school, there was a guy in class One day, I saw him with a stray cat at the riverside He found some stones And he slowly smashed the cat to death And then? He was often bullied back then His grades sucked as well Teachers said that he had no future But these had nothing to do with him killing the cat He was just happy doing it And you were watching as he did it? Yep I wanted to stop him. That was the right thing to do But if I did I would have something to do with it So I just watched I have to admit that I enjoyed watching the whole thing Why are you telling me this? I want you to know Daily routines have always been the same across different ages You don't have to be confused People will get it over time Can I get myself? Life just won't get better It's all about agony That agony has begun since you were born You think that a new place will change your fate? It's bullshit New place, new sufferings You understand?
