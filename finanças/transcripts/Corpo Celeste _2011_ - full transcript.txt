That's the overpass. We've arrived. Let's wait here. - Are you sure? - I'd say so. Now what do we do? Let's pray- In the coming election, vote Beniamino Spano, the force of the future... - Hi, Daddy. - Daddy's love, hi. Debby, aren't you cold? Here's your jacket. Come and get your jacket. Come here, sweetheart. Where are you going? Marta! Put it down! He'll tell us when! Girls, stay in line. Santa! Everything okay? They'll drive me crazy. Debby, you're here! I want you to meet my nieces. They're back from Switzerland. - Did you know that? - No. We're a little messy. We walked all night. You did the night pilgrimage? Rosa and Alfredo, her boyfriend. - He's from here. - A pleasure. I'm Santa. And the younger one, Marta. Where is she? Marta! Here she is. Hi, beautiful. How old are you? - Nearly 13. - Really? You'd never guess. You know, with the kids your age, I... Santa, come here! Excuse me. The loudspeaker's not working. - It worked a moment ago. - Well, it doesn't now. I meant to tell you it doesn't work sometimes. Let's get things going! Reverend, could we spread a tarp in case it rains? Okay, spread a tarp! A tarp. Let's cover the Virgin. Testing, testing... It's working. Dear brothers and sisters, your attention, please. We're gathered here, like every year, to renew our faith and the love for our community. This year is special though. In fact, Bishop Giorgio will take part in our procession. They tell me His Excellency's car is about to arrive. Let's wait for him in silence and welcome him with all the warmth and joy our community can offer. It's an order! Open the door! Marta! Let me in! - What time is it? - Relax. Your mother's sleeping. You're uglier than before. - Welcome. - Hello. You're late. They're waiting. Know where to go? I'll accompany you. You can get there through the rear door too, but I suggest you come this way to say hello to Jesus first of all. Children, who makes up the Church? The Pope and priests, non-Europeans, the people of God or the plant world? Come on, the p... Sara. The p... The Pope and priests. Are you sure? Is that your final answer? That's my final answer. - Tell her, Anna. - The people of God. Good for you! Kids, more energy! What's the name of Lazzaro's sister who listens to Jesus attentively? Mary, Martha, Sabrina or Jessica? Want to answer, my dear Marta? Don't be scared. Listen... Mary, Martha, Sabrina or Jessica? Come on, a name you know very well. Martha? Mary, the good sister is Mary. Tell her! Go take a seat. Did you go to catechism where you lived before? Sit here, next to Anna who's good. What did they teach you there? Did you take tests? - Can I go to the bathroom? - No. So, we were saying that Confirmation confirms, meaning it's the final confirmation of Christian values. It's a guarantee, a security. Without Confirmation, the doors to Paradise are closed and Matrimony too. With a small reading, you'll understand better. You have to memorize this. It's the formula of the Holy Ghost. Natale, stop clowning around! Now pay attention and listen to what Marco reads to us. Read it. "You are growing and it's an amazing experience for you. How many new things each day: your voice changes, your body transforms." It transforms... It transforms... "You feel useless, bored, depressed. You don't know your place in the world. But we know. The Church is the answer you're looking for." - The Church... - The Church... "Feeling the Holy Ghost is like wearing wonderful sunglasses that allow you to see things in a different way. It is through the Holy Ghost that you must see the world." See the world... See the world... It's hard to feel at home. How long were you in Switzerland? Ten or eleven years? Ten years. Pass me your plates. Take it off. You'll stain it with tomato! Leave me alone! Holy Mother, I can't get that dress off her. You know kids. They like to wear costumes. - She's not eating? - Tell her. She won't listen to me. Stuffed calamari. Thanks, Aunt! - I don't know if they're good. - You always say that. It's from the ocean. I'm not buying Mediterranean fish anymore. - Why? Isn't it fresh? - You never know what you're eating. With all the corpses in the sea, they choke... Nina's cousin in the navy told us. All the bodies they find! They're aliens. No, they're Moroccans. What should the fish eat? It's best to buy ocean fish. That's enough gloom. A toast. It may be thanks to God, or maybe to the sea, a toast I make, to these calamari. To the new house! - Me too! - Just a drop. - How did you prepare them? - Bread crumbs, parsley, garlic... ls Mom your garbage can? - Mom likes them. - Yes, they're excellent. Then take them from the pan. Don't eat her leftovers! I didn't touch it. Louder! Let us hear! Wonderful! You should have seen her in church. Fantastic! Debby, what's the church one like? - Good! - Come to Daddy! - Is our Marta ready for Confirmation? - Yes. She was already attending Sunday School in Switzerland. Here she's just started catechism. Father Mario insisted. He was right to insist! It's also a way to make friends. It's better to do it now and get it over with. - Isn't Marta's cake beautiful! - Happy birthday, Rosa. Happy birthday, Rosetta dear. - Did Marta make it? - Yes, by herself. - Who wants some? - Me! You, Uncle? No thanks. I'm really full. I'm stuffed too. Let's taste it! Delicious! You don't know what you're missing. I just eat and eat and leave no room for dessert. - Is that my bra? - Rosa, not now... - If she takes my stuff, she should tell me. - Don't argue. It's your birthday. What's she need a bra for? Look at her! She's a child! Stop! She runs off! Where's she going? She doesn't accept criticism. It's easy just to run off! "Holy Ghost, in times of trouble I seek you and call you. Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani. Like water flowing from the font of the sea, I entrust myself to you. Free me from the temptations of the world. Give me wisdom, intellect, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, mercy, fear of God." Holy Ghost, in times of trouble I seek you and call you. Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani. Give me... mercy, intellect, counsel, fortitude, knowledge... Fear of God! - Is he totally naked? - Yes. - Life-size? - Yes. Even down there? Children, you don't understand. Jesus' body is different from ours. It's a spiritual body, heavenly, holy. Can I go to the bathroom? Jasmine, especially you, listen to me. It's a figurative crucifix, meaning you see the whole figure of Jesus. - When will they bring it? - The day of Confirmation. On a donkey! It's Father Mario's idea, our reverend parish priest. He wants to organize a grandiose ceremony for when this gift is unveiled. I'm tuning into God He's the right frequency... - Have you seen lgnazio? - No, I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Father Mario, excuse me... Wouldn't you like to hear the children's Confirmation song? Yes. Children, keep the tempo. I'm tuning into God He's the right frequency I'm the one tuning in He's a goal for me I want to choose Jesus... I listen to His voice I listen to His command He teaches me so much He teaches me what I'm worth I want to choose Jesus... March elections are, for Calabria, a testing ground... What treatment! Go to bed. No, I'm fine here. I dreamed my teeth were falling out. Bad sign, right? Pretty much. Come here. Are your Confirmation classmates nice? Normal. That's good. - What? - They're not abnormal. - What do you do? - We sing. Let me hear. - I don't remember. - Come on, a little bit! - No, come on... - Are you shy? You're shy! Come on, a little bit for your mom who has to go to work. Okay, but close your eyes. Really close them! I want to choose Jesus... Oh, God. Why are you so selfish? Let Mom sleep! You sleep at night, don't you? Rosetta, I can defend myself. That's not true! You don't realize she's devouring all your energy. She's sucking up all you have left inside. What are you saying? These are your Confirmation clothes. They're my boyfriend's sister's. They have to be returned intact. You're welcome! - Rita, where've you been? - Sorry, the girls... It's okay now. The dough's rising over! Help him out. It was Jesus' very hands that revealed his holiness to people. Placing His hands, the Savior performed His first miracles, like this... Did she freeze? We too can experience this energy of faith that flows from our hands. And we'll do it with a game called "The dance of the man born blind." - Who can say who he was? - Me! Anna? The man born blind was a man who'd never seen, so Jesus Christ gave him sight. Good! - How did he do that, Jasmine? - No clue! - Cinzia? - With His hands? - How, Sara? - He put them on his face. I'll explain what He did exactly. Jesus used spit, saliva on His hands, and then He placed them on the man born blind. Wait. Wait. I remember one. How's it go? Jesus, take me in Your hands tonight. Watch over me till morning light. Doesn't count. It's not a prayer. - What is it? - A phrase. They remember every prayer that exists: the Credo for the Agonizing, the Credo for the Dying, the Credo for the Suffering... Mom? Get under! Tell me. Rest. Don't get overtired. I'm going to Alfri's. I'm a sufferer... Come on, stop! That's enough. Let's sleep. Come on. She might be back. Rest. Let's sleep. I pray for the moribund... That's enough. Real rest now. Chips, pastries, cookies, crackers... Drinks are missing. If we have to buy drinks, expenses increase. - Right, Father? - What? Sorry if I interrupt this idyll of drinks and crackers. We're worse than the kids! All they think of is clothes. - But who comes back after Confirmation? - The church is always full. Of course, there aren't many youths. But we're always here. If these kids get to Confirmation, it's no small thing. They have to study, grow... - Grow, that's the right word! - I didn't mean anything special... By now the church has become a place for toddlers, women, old ladies, people who have nothing to do. I think you're a pessimist. Sorry, maybe I didn't say that right. Let's look around and see what the world offers today: uncertainty, instability. The Church has to become a protagonist again. It has to propose extraordinary events, like ours: a new Confirmation, renewed. And the crucifix will be the gift for our community. It's a figurative crucifix. Right. We have to get this crucifix and hide it before the Bishop comes. Sunday morning. Is that enough time? It's two or three hours round trip, but I can't do it any earlier. He can't do it any earlier. At 3:00, Confirmation, Holy Mass and presentation of the crucifix... Cristiano, come here. At 5:00, the dance of the little virgins. The girls are ready. They need a good beating! Kids have to obey. Obey in the name of what? Settle down. I'll be right back. Where's he getting this figurative crucifix? It's in an abandoned church in Father Mario's town. - What's this exercise called? - Lining up for God. When would that be? For Confirmation. Excellent. I'm sorry. I can't before that. Seventy. All reliable people. Don't worry. About the other thing, tell His Excellency I feel ready and I could give much more if I were transferred. - Hear that? - What? They're transferring him. - What's that mean? - He just said so. He wants to have a bigger church. Why? In a more important church, he might be made bishop. Good for his career, even if he doesn't pray well. "Now, Master, let your servant go in peace, according to your word. For my eyes... have seen your salvation, which you prepared in sight of all the peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles... ...and glory for your people Israel. In waking save us, in sleep abandon us not..." I brought the next few days' meals. - Is it true you'll be transferred? - I wish! What do you mean "I wish?" And me? Even if they transfer me, I'll never forget the community. Besides, you should be glad. I'd be offered great responsibility. I know that, but who knows who they'll send in your place. Maybe one of those foreign priests. It's late. They're waiting for you at home. No, I brought sheets. I'll go change the bedding. - Will you be eating? - No, thanks. Look! It'll fall on your head. Let's go to the beach! - Wish I could! - Come on, please! - On foot? - Yes. - No. - Come on! - No. - I'll get it! The rent! May I? Our Confirmation girl! Here I am! Excuse me. It's untidy. You're eating. I'll come by later? No, no problem. Our schedule's all off. This is the rent. - Everything all right? - Yes. How's work? Fine. At least it's a job. If it weren't for the early hour, it would be perfect. Every job has its defects. Mine's a job too, but my task is much greater. I have to protect you, act in the parishioners' interest. That's why I need to know if I can count on you, on your family. This isn't a good period. There are so many bad types around. - The elections. - Of course. What am I supposed to do? You should put a signature here, name and surname. Ventura... Ventura Rita. Here? - Your other daughter? - Rosa? - Is she over eighteen? - Yes, just barely. - Rosetta! - What is it? Come here. - I have to study. - Sign here. Name and surname. You'll be voting at the grade school in Via Manzoni, voting station B. I think so. This is the candidate to vote for. For you too. - Madame Agata, good evening. - Evening, Father. - Everything all right? - Yes, please come in. Did you resolve that problem? Sara, start from further back. Far enough. Come forward. Stand straight. You're going towards God. Kids... Confirmation is your spiritual battle. You are now soldiers of Christ. You all look like mummies! Come on. Come forward. Stop. The formula. Holy Ghost, I entrust myself to you. Eli, Eli... - Eli, Eli lema sabachthani. - Good girl! - What's it mean? - They're God's words, Marta. - But what do they mean? - It's not the time. Sara, continue! I entrust myself to you like water flowing from the font of the sea. Free me of every sin. Forgive me and give me... Energy, Sara! Think... of Rambo. Do you know him? Come on! Continue. A cat! Flavia, a cat got in. Children, catch it. Natale! Good, Marta! Catch it. Like that. No, kids... Miss Marta Ventura, come with me. The formula. Holy Ghost, in times of trouble I seek you. Give me the fear of God... Do you believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible? I so believe. Do you believe in the Holy Ghost, which is the Lord and gives life, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting? I so believe! This is our faith, the faith of our church, and we glory to profess it in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. At this point, the Bishop will mark you with a cross and give you a symbolic slap, like this! When I'm big, I want to be a saint, so they'll all give me gifts. Want a gift? I'll give you my hair. Cut it. - I don't know how. - Try. Cut it. Then you can attach it to yours. I can't do it. Here. - How do I attach it? - You got your dress dirty! Where did you... get this? I don't want to see. What did you do? Show-off. - Let's go to the hairdresser's. - No, she stays like that. - She wants to be noticed. - Come on, both of you. Debby, let's go! Maybe I'd better not take Confirmation. Don't add more problems, Marta. Please. Sit up. You were right to cut it. It'll grow out stronger. After Confirmation, we'll go to the beach. Beautiful! Like a bride. Your hair too... Is it a custom in your country? The big day is here. Everything has to be perfect. You, go hang this in the hall. You, take care of the tables. You, spread the rug and take care of the stage. You, go to the storage room and get the decorations. Under the red veil? No, maybe under there. Move things! What did you find? Oh, yuck! - What should we do with them? - Let's take them home. No way! We should drown them! My grandpa put them in bags and boiled them. We'll boil you, not the cats! Put them down. You'll hurt them. What's going on? Don't touch them! They carry disease. - What disease? - All sorts... All of you, leave! You too. Don't touch them. Come out of here! Gennaro, get me lgnazio! What are you doing here? This goes nowhere. Marta! Marta, isn't that right? Is everything all right? What are you doing here? You should be getting ready! How did you get here? I walked. Santa? No one... Her mother's cell number? I understand. All right. - Get in the car. - No, thanks. I'll go on alone. - Get in the car. - I was going home. No one's there. Can you tell me what you were doing? Taking a walk. On the highway? Anyway, I really need a hand. - Where are we going? - To a village close by. The village I was born in. We're going to get the crucifix. We're on a mission. Wait for me in the car. Your participation demonstrates faith in our community. Long live Father Mario! Let's start over. Music! For the signatures, over here. - They're just a handful. - There's a flu going around. Do you understand me when I talk? If I tell you to wait in the car, there's a reason! Hello? Yes, she's with me. What should I have done? Go looking? Yes, I know... I won't get tired. Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani. - Like to eat something? - No, thanks. I thought there would be more people here. I'm just here for the signatures. Sure. A sweet for the little girl? - A nice bass? - Fifteen minutes, not more. Get it ready! Madame Angela... I don't want to disturb you, but I'd like a favor. Pray for my sister. She has a disease that won't go away. I'm praying so hard. - If you could pray for her too... - Of course. This is her picture. Her name's Caterina. - Mom? - Just a minute... Give her a kiss. I'll pray for your sister. Excuse her. That's how she is, but she's a great cook. I know. - You're not eating? - I don't eat fish. Too bad. You know how much calcium it has? No, stay right here. How did you get dirty? Miss? Occupied. Is everything all right? Take this. It's the first time, huh? It's a nice thing, even though it seems bad. I need the bathroom. Go where you want. There's not a soul here. I'll wait for you in the church. What are you doing? I didn't recognize you. I don't see very well. I'm taking it away, to warmth and safety. Anyway, by now this place... See how you let it get ruined? Hello? - How are you? - Fine. - Wait. Where are you going? - I'm late. I need to call. Are you a priest? Yes. - You study like priests do? - Yes. What does "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani" mean? It's a cry. It's Jesus crying out, "My God, why have you forsaken me?" - Why is he crying out? - Because he's angry. How do you imagine him? Good. Smiling? Yes. With blue eyes, ready to hug you? Yes. Instead, he's angry, furious. He's alone, running from one place to another. Everywhere they ask him for healing, miracles, and he runs to them all. With ignorant disciples around him, who don't understand a thing and always ask him for explanations. They don't have a bit of imagination. And they're scandalized. Read. "When his family heard this, they went out to restrain him, for they said: 'He is out of his mind."' He's here. - Who? - The Bishop. Now what do we do? He shouldn't have waited till the last minute to get that crucifix. - He had other business. - What do we do? It makes us look like a disorganized parish. - I'd say... - Let's start with the dance! Girls, get ready. Marta, let's go. Come on. Give me a hand. - Hello. - This is my mother. Hello. A pleasure. I'm Santa. And Marta? Didn't she tell you? Father Mario chose her for a very important thing. They've gone together to get the new crucifix. When? She didn't tell me anything. I don't know. I'm sorry. Please, have one. Wouldn't you like to join us? There is the dance of the little virgins. We've organized many nice things. I'll go then. Duty calls. May I ask a question? Where exactly will Father Mario be transferred? Why this bizarre question? Since there's a certain degree of familiarity between us, he told me he might be transferred to a more famous parish. Who are you? Santa. Yes, but who are you to our Holy Mother Church? What do you represent? His Excellency would like a handkerchief. I'll see to it right away. - After Confirmation, what else do we do? - Nothing. We go to church, that's all. - Do you read the Gospel? - Every day, at mass. You know what they said about Jesus? - What did they say? - That He was crazy. Nonsense! Yes, angry, furious. It's all ready. So, have you decided? Will you transfer or stay here with us? Where could I ever go? There's a stain. Everything is ready. What a shame. I was curious to see that crucifix. You know what happened? That girl Marta cut the ropes and the crucifix fell. Don't bad-mouth my sister. My brothers and sisters, first of all, I apologize to the whole community. Today our children become mature. Thanks to our Bishop Giorgio, who... with his... presence... Wanna see a miracle? Look! It's still alive.
