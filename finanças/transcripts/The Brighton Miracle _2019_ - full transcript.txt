145 to 17, people still laugh about it. Frankly, it should never have happened. But who gives a damn about history? It's over-rated. It was all about the glorious uncertainty of elite sport. And it went well beyond the playing field. [CROWD ROARING] It was devastating. It was completely unexpected. It was a sporting catastrophe. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let me tell you, these guys are here to embarrass you, embarrass your families. They want to show the world who they are and you don't deserve to be here. A lot of people think that was a tough time for me. But I was given a role to perform for the team. It was all the training, all the promises, it all counts for nothing. [MUSIC PLAYING] And believe me, nobody had any inkling of what was going to transpire that day. You got to stay with them, do what they hate. You give more than you ever had. To challenge for a win and go down fighting for it. That's a lot more honorable way to go down. Play our way, Japan way. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] Every anniversary makes that nightmare feel like yesterday. It was 17 years ago! It′s time to move on. Let′s talk about today. Are were sure about the new coach? I thought we already agreed. He′s not signed... He′s Australian. I heard he can be difficult. He′s half Japanese. He was born in Australia. He doesn′t care about our way. We′re ready. Eddie, how do you feel? Yeah good, mate, happy. JR, we need new assistant coaches. I'll make a list. We already have assistant coaches. I know. The first time I heard about Eddie coaching the national team, I think I may have heard it from my wife. I'm home. Hey. I'm off to do some extra training. I thought we were going to the real estate agency. Oh, can we do that next week? If you're having second thoughts, just tell me. But rugby won't last forever, Michael. No second thoughts. I heard on the news that Eddie Jones signed on to coach Japan. Half Australian, half Japanese, that guy? I heard him talk. He's 100% Australian. I heard he's a cranky bastard. You know, I was a little bit intimidated, but excited at the same time, because although he was a grumpy coach, I knew he got results. I heard he's a cranky man. Anyway, I've got to go. See you later. [PHONE RINGING] JR, what's the news? I got permission to get two new coaches. Two out of eight, that's 25%. Call me back when you get 100. But-- So that's full time here in Tokyo. The French Barbarians defeating Japan by 40 points to 21. Coach Eddie Jones certainly has some work to do before the World Cup. Leitchy, that was shocking, mate. Where's that pride? There was no leadership out there. Eddie, the French were too good. Rubbish. We had early penalties. We had chances to get points, but we didn't take them. You always take the points on offer. It's not as if the French were too good. We weren't good enough. There's a difference. I heard you got demoted to a desk job at your company. I start tomorrow. Goro... for your position, where do you rank yourself in the world? Top 20? Maybe. Mate, you're not even in the top 100. At the World Cup, this team needs you to be the best. And you can be, but you've got to work hard. The press conference was an interesting situation. Eddie Jones and team captain Hirose. Eddie-- Yeah, really poor performance by us today. Nothing courageous or brave about their performance. I'm disappointed with my player's attitude. Didn't want to win enough, didn't want to change enough. So I'm going to have to change the players. I cannot have performances like that for Japan. I apologize for that performance because I'm responsible for it. And I guarantee I'm going to make some changes. I better stop now. Hirose, do you agree? It's not funny. That's the problem in Japan. They're not serious about winning. Do we want to grow up so we can compete? I'm sick of people thinking that half an effort is acceptable. It's not. He's killing us. It was tough on Hirose, but I think it was a message that had to be said. At the press conference, I didn't mean to be disrespectful... At first, I felt a little upset with Eddie, but when I look back and think about it, what he said was correct... It was embarrassing. If I'd paid to watch, I'd want a refund. Eddie, you can't change them overnight. You've only just got the job. Ned, if we don't win, I won't have a job. Before you know it, the World Cup will be here. And you know a good teams do to Japan at the World Cup. In 1995, New Zealand beat Japan 145 points to 17. Now how does a team get over that? It affects the whole country. Eddie, stop talking. I'm serious. So am I. I've told you before, there are some things in life we can't control. Uncontrollables, Eddie, that's life. Those kids that used to call you all sorts of names when you were young, could you control them? No. Could you control your reaction? Yes. Focus on the controllables, Eddie, and get some rest. You can't keep doing 20-hour days. Get some rest. I will. I'm sorry to call when you've not been there so long. I called your brother. I told him not to be with those boys. He crashed his car. He's gone, Michael, he's gone. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Oh, I almost forgot, could you come and visit my English school? The students always ask if you can. I'm just a rugby player. You should get a baseball player. But you're the only person they know that's famous. And you've been on television. To them, that means you're famous. Just 20 minutes. OK. Thank you. Now, let's get back to it. You're writing looks good. Growing up in New Zealand as a half caste, I struggled to fit in. So when I moved to Japan, I came across the same struggles. Excuse me. When did you come to Japan? Ten years ago. Ah, you've got ID. Check the details. Please check... People would often judge on the appearance. And to lose your identity in a foreign country is a dangerous thing. Stay out of trouble. Lucky for us, our game got drowned out by baseball and soccer news. The game maybe, but the press conference keeps getting replayed. Eddie's crazy. Am I the only person he sends texts to at 2AM? 2:28AM. We all get those. Stop complaining. Besides, somebody had to say it. Our performance wasn't acceptable. What's not acceptable? We want to talk about the World Cup. Well, me too. What's the update on the new coaches? Well, you said Marc Dal Maso is crazy. But do you still want him? He is crazy, but he gets results. There are 30 countries in the world with a bit of scrum than ours. We look like idiots out there. Eddie, there's a process. I know the process, mate. Every four years, Japan loses every World Cup game. Just for once, imagine what it would be like to win against a top three ranked team in the world. Can you at least imagine that? [MUSIC PLAYING] Let's talk about things after the Fiji game. Michael Leitch is back from injury. Eddie, our players are doing their best. Well, their best isn't good enough. The world champions. are taking the easy way. But worse than that, they expect to lose. And that's what's not acceptable. Eddie, you can't walk out. Bullshit. Results don't change because nothing around here changes. If I stay, I contribute to that. You lot have got to stop managing failure and change your thinking. We've got good players. But how can they be great if we expect to lose? Has anybody ever walked out on us before? We're considerate, aren't we? Very. We're trying to help him. Soon, we'll know who were playing in the World Cup. It doesn't matter who it is. We going to win. It starts today, JR. Do you believe we can win? You'll have to lie much better than that, mate. So work on it. Just get me those coaches. I want them all here after the Fiji game, OK? Don't fail, JR. You might be wondering why they call me JR. Why everybody call me JR, which is I've been lost Japan Railways in Tokyo, maybe more than 100 times, even though I'm Japanese. It's really a shame. Our appointment with the estate agent is at noon. Sorry. Can we do it next week? I'm really sorry. Thanks for coming, mate. All good, mate, all good. Grab yourself a drink. I'll have a coffee. I want to talk about the present captain. Too old, too slow. It's your job if you want it, mate. Grab those drinks. The real Eddie wouldn't do that. What would he do? Blow your head off. Thanks for coming, mate. All good mate, all good. I ordered you a latte. Heard it's your favorite. You hungry? No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Have a seat. How's Satomi? Yeah, she's good. Now, Captain, great guy, great leader, on and off the field, but he's 32. His best games are behind him. This game against Fiji, going to be his last game as captain. Then his role is going to be off-field captain. He's great for team morale. Have you told him? Mate, from now on, I want you to be our on field captain. What if I improve? I can do extra work. After the Fiji game, mate, I can't make any promises. It was hard to take it... I tried to work out what it was that Eddie was trying to tell me... I wanted to understand how he thinks so I could improve. You know, it was a pretty exciting time. I had my whole family there, watching. I just come back from injury. So now's a great opportunity to put my hand up for the World Cup spot. So, you know, I was very excited for that game. It's a big day here in Asian Championship, Japan vs Fiji. Homecoming of sorts for Michael Leitch, recovering from broken arm and clearly relishing the moment. I'm watching it now. Leitch has led from the front all day, inspirational. More up-tempo play Japan. Leitch for the ball, a brilliant run for the big fellow. That looks terrible. To look down and see your foot facing the opposite direction, two years out from the World Cup, you know, it's very, very scary. And I really did reconsider my options at that time. He's late. I'm glad we're be back from Fiji. Don't you like the place? I miss sushi. They have seafood in Fiji. It's not the same. Sitting in traffic last week, everybody looked so glum. They wake up, they sit in traffic, on crowded trains. Most of them hate their job. Why do it, mate? Probably to pay bills. Do you like your job? I've got a lot of bills. Who do you hope we play first? It doesn't matter what I hope, mate. A team ranked lower than us. Japan Rugby Association, Omura speaking. The first game, South Africa. Holy moly, now we're coming up against the biggest and most physical team in world rugby. We've got no chance. The first game you play the most successful team in world cup history. What are your thoughts? Yeah good mate, very pleased. And what are your plans leading in? Make myself redundant. It's true. I want the players to think for themselves. They're the ones on the field, not me. Realistically, you have no chance of winning. Will you rest of good players and focus on game two? We haven't got enough good players to rest any, mate. People are already saying that it could be a 100 point difference. I think, 145? Listen mate, I don't know your bosses is, but he's a liar. You don't know him, but you know that? Well, he called me this morning and told me you were smart. [PHONE RINGING] Must be your boss, mate. The more I thought about us playing against South Africa, the more I liked it. So there it is, the familiar physical dominance of South Africa, just too much more than New Zealand... ...All Blacks. Springbok's winning by 18 points to 5. Hey, how about this one? Looks good. Do you want to do some studying after? No, I'm fine. That's three nights in a row we haven't studied. Tomorrow. You said that yesterday. I got to go. You can hardly walk. I'll be fine. He said he will pick me up. Would you hire you as captain? If you don't want me as captain, just say it. What did you learn at school? You went to school, right? I learned how to read. Could've done that at home. Why are we talking about this? A person has to go to school. What if you lived where there were no schools? I'd get by. How? What do you want to say, Eddie? This country, it's like a big school. They want everybody to think the same, take the same tests. Want everybody to be nice. There's nothing wrong with it. There you go again. I don't know what we're talking about. Responsibility, mate. It's not something that's given to you. Here we go again, eh? Something you take. You take responsibility for your family. You take responsibility for yourself. How can you take responsibility when you're too worried what everybody else thinks? I would hire me as captain. Why? Because I care about the team, that's why. You hire you as captain so you can lead them to win. How's your leg, mate? It's getting better. Good. We're only five minutes from your place. I'll catch you later, mate. I can only take 31 players to the World Cup. Some of our new assistant coaches. There's more to come. You don't like what you see, you change it, mate. Your players only have half a body. Is this a school team? You tell him he's here to fix problems, not to be one. Or he can grab a baguette and go home. He's lame and he's beating you. Most of you need to change your mindset or go home and apologize to your wives for wasting their time. You choose to be here. You choose this spot. But who's at home making it possible. Then you put in this bullshit effort. Who's going home to apologize to their partners? Bring it down, bring it down. Bring it down, bring it down. Tell them they're the worst group. Can you do that a bit better? I didn't say it like that. You think the South Africans are going to talk nice to them? They won't. Now say it properly or go home. You are the worst group! What is this? A day in the park? Did you bring your picnic rug? Eddie is the type of coach to put so much pressure on us. Do you want me to say that? Yes. Did you bring your picnic rug? So after a period of time, you become familiar with how Eddie operates. Go. Focus on the ball. OK. Anyone that's worked with Eddie knows that he doesn't sleep. He works the hardest. And that's why he's always grumpy. You been in Japan too long. You care more about blending in, bowing here, arigato there. You're not Japanese, mate. He actually said that more than once. Every time he said it, it really used to make my blood boil. He's a good character, so I wanted him to act himself and not be someone else. Because what sometimes happens with foreign players in Japan, they try to become Japanese. How long to get these guys ready? JP thinks a year. Steve? The same. Mark? Two years. You all right, mate? What's the matter. The players don't like you. Did they like the previous coach? Very much. And how many games did Japan win at the last World Cup? None. This isn't social media, mate. I don't give a shit about likes. We're here to do a job. If you don't like it, you can bundy off. You going to bundy off? I don't know what that means. It means quit, mate. Are you going to quit? Anything else? JP thinks the camp's too hard, 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, six days a week. The players will not last. I didn't say anything about 6:00 AM. I said 5:00 AM. We'll never be bigger or stronger than South Africa, but we will be fitter and smarter. We have to prepare to win. There's a difference between preparing and preparing to win. And so we focus very much on controlling on what we could control and not worrying about the uncontrollables. I'm here to help. Do we have anything to talk about? I don't like my coach. Anything else? I don't like Eddie. Let me guess, you don't like your coach. Did somebody tell you? Rugby. That's all Eddie wants to focus on. I think the only person you can control is yourself. So if people don't like the way you operate, then so be it. Eddie, sorry. You need to plan better, JR. Don't tell me it's because of traffic, because there's traffic every day. I'll be there soon. We've got a long drive into the country today. Well, that's if you ever get here, mate. What's wrong, mate? Nothing, just-- I decided to check the World Cup training facility today. You're not supposed to be reading texts while you're driving, mate. Sorry. You want me to read it? No. I mean, no, you're right. That was stupid. You're a bit strange today, mate. Everything OK? Yep. Eddie... There's something I need to say. Stop the car, mate. What? Stop, stop the car. Go back to where you came from and take your stupid looking mum -- Eddie, come here, please. This is for you. It always gets up. Very soon, a nice man from the Returned Servicemen's League is going to come and cut our grass. I want you to help this kind man, OK? Mom, what do you do when you're scared of something? When I'm scared, I close my eyes and I think about my family. And I think about the best outcome in that moment. No matter how scared I am, I force myself to smile. Then I open my eyes. Is that all? Yes. The next time, when silly boys call you names, smile and say something intelligent. Silly people don't like that. Good morning. Hello, thank you for coming. Ted, my husband, he'd be so grateful. This is number 34 right. Yes. I'm sorry. Sorry. I thought he was going to cut our grass. Perhaps, he remembered that he had something else to do. Scrum, Randwick feed... Well, look at you. Everyone knows that Asians can't play rugby. Suit yourself, mate? If we were real estate, you'd be the cheapest house on the street. Even your teammates think you're run down. You bastard. Get off. Get a renovation, mate. Thank you. Eddie, elbows. The real estate line was funny. You were there? Asians can't play? What would have you said. Life's not a popularity contest, Eddie. You do your best. And if only you know that, that's enough. Did you do your best? Chess originated in 6th century India. Was coughing a strategy back then? No, but thinking was important. [Coughing] Knowing your objective is important. So is maintaining your morale. You having fun? It's your move. Are you going to cough? Depends if you need me to. Check-- It's like life, don't you think? Do what it takes to stay in the game. You didn't cough. You didn't think. [INAUDIBLE Speech in Dream] But he need to find a new career. Eddie, you're in hospital. You had a stroke. Bullshit. I hope to play with the All Blacks. Forget the All Blacks. How can you forget those bastards? When this drug wears off, I'm out of here. It's not a drug. You need a lot of therapy. Where's the therapy room? Take this out. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Jones, nobody should be here before 7. I know. [MUSIC PLAYING] You are not supposed to be on that. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Jones, it's nearly midnight. I'm nearly finished. [MUSIC PLAYING] Eddie, I'm curious, who inspires you? My parents, mate. Can I ask why. My mother was born in California, Japanese-American. After Pearl Harbor, she was interned. I never heard her say a bad word about anybody. And your father? People abused him because his partner was Asian. Then they abused him when he came back from Vietnam. I never heard him say a bad word about anybody. You mentioned Vietnam. I heard you grew up in a white society at the time. How was that? It was fine, mate. Our job is to take care of rugby in this country. I understand. We need a new coach. We already have a new coach. And now Eddie's sick. We have a caretaker coach. It's only been a month. Did you say that Eddie wants Michael Leitch as captain? Because Hirose is a good captain. I know but Eddie wants Michael. At the last world cup, we had too many non-Japanese players. The media attacked us. It's not about the media. Of course not, but Michael Leitch isn't Japanese, and our coach isn't Japanese... This is supposed to be a Japanese team. Eddie's half-Japanese. Half-Japanese doesn't count. He's Australian. And Michael Leitch is? Half Kiwi. What's the other half? He's half Fijian. Why does half count now? What happened to the good old days? You mean when we lost by 145 points? Please don't fire him. [RADIO BROADCAST ...makes it New Zealand, 54, Japan 6.] Dear Eddie, I won't write about your health, because I know you'll be taking care of that. But perhaps you've had thoughts about changing your career, or maybe others are suggesting it. All those damn experts don't know what they're talking about. What people do when nobody's watching, that's the key, Eddie. So many people just give up. They'll never know how close they were to doing something because we all need to push through the mud of life to find our gold. Belief Eddie, it fuels everything. It washes away the mud and brings clarity. Slow, but always strong, Eddie. Yukkuri So many times I wanted to quit the military, but I didn't, which allowed me to meet your mother. Eddie, we just come back from Scotland. Yeah, I see. You still need a coach? Everybody supports you. I have a bad feeling about this. Happy thoughts, Michael. Happy thoughts. Great choice. 36 month lease, right? I take it the agreement's in your name? Mine. We'll find another place. That place is perfect. Excuse me. Do you have ID? You checked me before... ...do you remember? Stay out of trouble. Let's go. He didn′t do anything wrong. Why don′t you stop other people? What's going on, Michael? They didn't ask for my ID. You never told me that they checked you before. It's fine. We don't have to go to my English school, OK? It was a dumb idea. Hey, it doesn't matter what people say. We'll never please everybody. Welcome back, Eddie. Yeah, good to be back. How's things? Goro needs to work harder. Everyone's ready for you. You stayed back after your class to meet me. Thank you. I want you to think about your study like a game of rugby. Welcome back, Eddie. Why Michael Leitch for captain? He's his own man. He'll make the right decisions. We all have goals, but sometimes it feels like we're getting nowhere. Japan has an Australian coach and a Fijian captain from New Zealand. Is this good for Japan? I think it's consistent with the foreign flavor to your squad. You've got a captain who's not Japanese. Someone just said he was Fijian. I thought he was a Kiwi. What's your point, mate? Other times, you make progress and you feel great... ...but it doesn't last long. You've got a lot of foreigners in your squad. We've got less foreign born players than other countries. Not true. I don't have all the answers, but whatever your challenge is, whether it's studying English, or playing rugby, the answer is always within you. You should open your eyes more than your mouth. Samoa has more. So does Tonga. France has 10 foreign born players. Australia nine. And their captain was born in Saudi Arabia. But you only care about attacking what you think looks wrong. So when everybody's telling you what to do, just be true to yourself and do what's burning inside. That way, you'll always do right. So let's talk about what most people think looks wrong. Michael Leach is black, but he'll captain Japan. And I wouldn't care if he was purple, mate. So you go write that in your column, that only 15 people read. Thank you and good luck. [APPLAUSE] Anyone that's worked with Eddie has being sprayed at least 1,000 times, but Eddie, he has a genuine care for people he loves. [MUTED TV] Watch his job giant stride, taking to the front, as he faces the last blood bursting furlong to the finishing place. In rugby, I′ve had good time and bad time. The good times are when people are supporting. Anyone who's been with Eddie have come out better than they were before. During the off season, I want you to arrange for me to meet Pep Guardiola. He coaches Bayern Munich. I also want to visit a team in the Tour de France. I want to see how they train. We needed to take things as positives, not negatives, and we needed to think about what we could do next. It's hard work. And then you meet Eddie, and he just puts it on a different level. You don't know how to work until you've met Eddie Jones. How was Perth? Very good. The cyclists? Tough, mate. Good to be here, good to see everybody back. --a lot of good teams to play and a lot of camps. But let me tell you this, how many times in your life do you get a chance to make history? You do that by beating South Africa. [LAUGHTER] How does it feel to know that people think you're a joke? Did you hear that laughter? People think you're a joke. And people in this room have lost their family homes, their farms, have had them washed away in the tsunami. Some of you have handicapped children, and people laugh when you're trying to do something to help support your families. Training, preparation, you need to know that doing your best will not be enough. Doing your best only keeps you with the pack. When training finishes, most of you vanish. Is that your best? Ask yourself, is that your best? Roger Bannister, all the experts said it was impossible to break the four minute mile. He didn't give a shit about what people said. Instead, he tells everybody he'll break the four minutes and he gave them a date and a place. So he wakes up. It's raining and windy. But he knew it was only going to take a half a percent improvement, a half a percent improvement to do what nobody in the world had ever done before. So he runs, 3 minutes 59. The next month, another guy breaks four minutes. The following year, three people do it. So what the hell do experts know? I'll tell you what they know, nothing. And that's a good thing. Because all the experts say you can't win. We're going to hunt these guys down and they won't see us coming. We're going to do everything they don't want us to. Our smaller size will be our advantage. They can't adapt. They play one way. We'll be able to play a number of different ways. If it's raining, if it's windy, if it's dry, it won't matter. Now people will say you can't win. A billion people thought he couldn't do it, but he did. So screw the experts. He set a date and a place. And ours is the 19th of September, Brighton, England. And we will win. Let's go. Chest up, think faster guys. Go, go, go. [YELLING] South Africa think you're weak. Work them hard, mate, don't sugarcoat it. I've seen every South African lineup in the last eight years. They've got nothing on us. Stick to the plan. You should be comfortable being uncomfortable. Move it. lower, get lower, lower, lower. Lower. That's the hardest session I have ever seen. Day one, 150. Call them again. Which part, mate? All of it. They're adults, not kids. Keep them hydrated. South Africa's going to take them places they've never been before. If they're going to break, let it happen here. Everybody back with JP. All right, let's go. On 2, 1, 2, start. He's gonna kill them. He knows what he′s doing. Goro.. During the last World Cup, you got a phone call to join the National team. Told everybody the good news, everybody celebrated. Then they called you an hour later, tell you you're not needed. Must have been disappointing. You're a talented guy, mate, but that's not enough. This is your problem. You fix this or you're going to get another disappointing phone call. Every player that had been in that camp would have said it's the hardest time of their life. The training camp was so hard, that I don′t even want to remember it. Eddie made us train 4 times a day and almost every day. Why do we have to train every day, 5:00 AM? Why are we doing this? I think it really was... hell. We absolutely got flogged. It′s really easy to give up, or quit because you were told something is impossible. There was no break from training at all. It was a very, very tough time, and the team started to dissemble. JR, you tell them that they can't go on strike. How many? OK, I'll have a talk to him. What's so important, mate? You seriously don't know? You're not the only people in the world that finish work in a bit of pain. You ever worked in construction? You guys are pampered and you complain. We'll have nothing left in the tank, Eddie. You'll be fine. They busted me. Some of the boys are talking about walking away. That's not my problem. How is that not your problem? I'm not on the field against South Africa. You think they're going to take it easy on you. This is bullshit. You're listening to bullshit, Leitch, that's the problem. Eddie, we're training eight hours a day. I'm not happy about that either. I wanted nine. When people don't take responsibility, they make excuses, mate. You're not going to have anybody at training tomorrow. That's not my problem. Whatever you said, it worked. All I'm hearing is complaining. I don't care what the board says. You go back to your rooms if you like. Wait! Somebody changed the board. I saw it last night. It was full. I saw it this morning, it said, ‶no training.″ Mate, I don't give a shit about the board. What's wrong with you guys? We're so far behind South Africa, we can't afford to rest. Are you telling me you can't train? He′s right. We′ve got trainers who know what they′re doing. We have to trust them. We're going to be playing South Africa. We are. We'll be the ones who'll be embarrassing our families, ourselves. And I'm sick and tired of getting our asses kicked by good teams. We need to work. Goro, what do you want to do? I wanna beat South Africa. Anybody that doesn't want to beat South Africa can leave. Together, let's go, let's go. Form a line, one three, 1, 2, 3. Bring it in... Very good. Enjoy tonight. Tomorrow we'll take a walk together. Then we'll make our way to the airport. 1, 2, 3, History!! Go over it again. From the hotel to the ground in Brighton. 12 minutes by bus. I booked a reserve bus in case something happens. The uncontrollables, what are they? Your weather and that. What's the plan? I'd meet with local police about getting an escort from the hotel to the ground. And you'll provide all details to the other staff members, because-- I could get hit by a bus. Mate, I don't think you will. But if something does happen, they won't call the game off. That's a relief. Took you 150 days to make a joke, mate. I wasn't joking. Go get some rest. Thanks, goodnight. Hello. [SPEAKING ON PHONE] Eddie Jones... What's the matter? [SPEAKING ON PHONE] Your father, he spoke of you right up until the end. He'll always be with you. That's why we called you, Eddie. I'll get a flight back tonight. [SPEAKING ON PHONE] Don't you dare, young man... ...Your father didn't go from mission to mission... ...when he was in the military so that you could run away... ...from yours. [SPEAKING ON PHONE] He served his country with pride... ...you stay there and do your job. Losing a family member is tough for anyone. If they're sick or old, you always want an extra day with them, but those things you can't control. He heard yesterday. Is he going home? [SINGING] I look up as I walk, [SINGING] So that tears won′t fall. [SINGING] lRemembering those spring days, [SINGING] But I am all alone tonight. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] I look as I walk... ...so that the tears won′t fall. [SINGING] Remembering those spring days... ...but I am all alone tonight. [MUSIC] Each headstone represents a life. Your lives are still ahead. How will people remember you? Enjoy your time here. [SINGING] Remembering those autumn days... ...but I am all alone tonight. [SINGING] Sadness hides in the shadow of the stars... ...sadness hides in the shadow of the moon. [MUSIC] My father's favorite Japanese word was "yukkori" take your time-- Yukkori, When we see things against South Africa, it's your call. It's your game, mate. Don't blend in. Make your brother proud. [SINGING] I look as I walk... ...so that the tears won′t fall... ...though the tears well as I walk... ...but I am all alone tonight... Eddie, you're one day away from playing South Africa. And they've picked their most experienced side ever, with 880 test caps. Big day, mate. We've heard that you've just come off a camp that lasted for 150 days. Was it really that long? Yeah, something like that. I can't count that high, mate. Well, thanks for your time, Eddie, and good luck. Thank you, mate. Leitch-- that was crap, mate. It's embarrassing. You kept talking to the media, so I started things. I said I'd be 10 minutes. I was seven. We're playing South Africa tomorrow. We've dropped more balls in five minutes than we did in five months. No wonder people are saying we're going to lose by 80 points. We're fine, Eddie, go. From what I saw, I don't think so. We're good. Go. Michael, I called your room. Are you OK? What if we do lose by 80, or 100? Don't say that. Eddie's shown us every tape on them. We know every player, their nicknames, the way they run, tackle, line out, scrum. But for every player on our team, they're better. You should sleep, Michael, OK? Just be you. That's the most important thing. Thank you. I'll see in the stands, eh? What if we do lose by 80, 100? I was just asking a question. You don't get it. I was just asking a question, Eddie? You don't take fear home, mate. Even if you have to lie through your teeth. It's late, Eddie. Every big game, we send our supporters home as losers. Are you listening? They shuffle along. They got their heads down. They've just wasted half their weekend. But they come back. Week after week, they come back. You owe them. What about you? I'm not on the field. In every position, South Africa are better than us. That's true. But there's no way they're fitter. They're stronger. We're more unified. They're faster, more experience. I don't give a damn. And neither should you. Every second, every play, we play for each other and our supporters. Get some rest, mate. [CHILDS VOICE] Mom, what do you when you're scared of something? Perfect weather and a capacity crowd here in Brighton. And we are moments away from kickoff. And on face value, this is a classic mismatch. South Africa, the team with the best strike rate in World Cup history against Japan, the team with the worst overall record. Just one win from 24 attempts. Eddie, thank you for everything. Thank you, you made it possible. Good luck. Thankyou. It's time. You gotta stay with them, do what they hate. You give more than you ever had. You do that, you win this game. Play our way, Japan way. Let's go. Match four of Rugby World Cup 2015. And this is Tui, the number eight forward. And he is immediately taken heavily down the Japanese goal line. And Japan, immediately under pressure. Goromaru over halfway to Kirchner.. Kirchner sizes up. It hasn't been a fast chase with Japan. They found space. Japan under pressure here. ...du Plessis... First scrum, so important for Japan. Japan won... Here we go, Goromaru... Oh, he threw the dummy... South Africa off side and a first shot at points in the game for Japan. Goromaru puts Japan ahead by 3 today. Calling on the Japanese to do a lot of passing now. Slowly, but surely, they encroach on the Japanese goal line. South Africa controlling, ...has it. That's what they are so good at. The power to match them up front. Tapped back by Habana. Mvovo... Another penalty, another shot at goal. Very uncharacteristic, this. You can only tackle for so long against this sort of onslaught. There's a gap. Here's Matfield and Berger. Here it is now for-- no, not quite. But here it is. Oh. Tatekawa Japan trailing 7-3. Nice little kick. ...they slipped it away nicely. The back's joining in. It's a 10 man maul. South Africa holding on grimly. The Japanese heads towards the posts. Can they do it? Oh, yes, it looks like the skipper. Goromaru now to squeeze it out to 3. This is brilliant support play for the Japanese defense. Jesse Kriel to Tui. Sa'u stuck with him. They've worked so hard on countering the South African maul, but they've got a problem here again. The Japanese desperate to hold on here as South Africa apply the screws. Japan's defense is staying composed and holding their formation. Big tackle. And that sums up Japan's performance in the first half. You just went toe to toe with the team with the best record in World Cup history. Are they supermen? I saw them bleeding, hunched over, sucking air. They're spent. They're trying to do their best. But we know that's not good enough. They're out on their feet. They're fatigued, but they're winning. Goro, we need those kicks. How do your families feel right now? How do your supporters feel? We're not here to be valiant losers, not today. Those days are over. This is when you leave everything on the field, everything you've got and more. Find that half a percent more. Our finishers are ready to go on. We keep playing fast. We keep doing what they hate. And we don't stop. You deserve this. Your families deserve this. Don't let them down. 40 minutes to make history. It's no longer about you. You're out there for other people. Play with pride. You get this done. Penatly is on against South Africa. ...within penalty range. And a chance for Japan now to hit the lead. [CHEERING] We're just outside the 22. He's a giraffe. ...a human one. Now here's an opportunity for du Plessis.. de Jager goes again. Oh-- oh, no-- Tanaka, good attacking position. Try and hold him up here. And the Boks are back in the lead by three. As you say, a monumental upset is in the offing as Matsushima shows dash, in courage, and bravery. Strauss straight through. He can't stop him. 17 minutes remaining. South Africa looking to see if they can get back to back tries here to put Japan out of touch. there's space.. Now they go away with a .... Sa'u Still good enough to win the lineup. It's been very good, the Japanese lineup. Here we go, Matsushima!! [ROARING] Oh, yeah-- huge trouble here. Cut down just before the line. The upset is still on for Eddie Jones and the brave Blossoms. South Africa has it by 3. Well read by Goromaru. 3 on 3. Japan looking for an historic win and they have a head of speed. They're being tested here. There's the step. Dangerous. Broadhurst. So close. He's been held up. Now they go into driving maul. The whole team's there. They're calling for the drive. 13 seconds to go. I need you to take the kick. Do they go for the draw, Joel, or do they go for the win. Take the 3. Wow, he's virtually declined the draw. He says we are here to win. This is now the biggest scrum of the game. Japan still have it. Leitch the captain.... ...trying to give the Japanese this monumental upset. It's tough going for Japan. There goes Leitch. He's strong. Tatekawa Mafi Here we go. [CROWD ROARING] The 145-17 nightmare is over! Our eyes have seen the glory. It's a rugby miracle. [MUSIC PLAYING] We're a proud-- we're a very proud rugby playing nation. And I think no one expected the Springboks to come unstuck against a team from Japan. I mean, that's the reality. Not only in rugby, generally it's very easy to give up. But what you get from giving up is regret. If you commit to a challenge, there is a power developing inside of you. It's something that inspires and invigorates people. This enables you to exceed people's expectations, which is what happened in the South Africa game. We're-- we often take things for granted, is probably one way to look at it. But certainly, on a day like that, to lose to one of the minnows of world rugby was devastating. It was completely unexpected. And as great as it was maybe for the game, and for the World Cup, for us, as South Africans, it was a sporting catastrophe. So the decision not to kick the goal was a brave decision. And we were pleased that Leitch made the decision. At the exact moment, I was obviously upset. But we backed him to make decisions. To take the kick and miss, that would haunt me for the rest of my life. But to challenge the win, go for the try, and create new history, that was one of the biggest decisions of my life. Particularly in sport, you know, we all chat about players being confidence players. I mean, every single sportsperson in the world has is a confidence player. If you don't believe, you are never going to be able to achieve. Deep, deep down inside, you've got to-- you've got to find that ability, that strength, to go and play the game, to go and do something spectacular, to go and do the incredible, the unexpected. And for me, it's really simple. It is all about believing. If you don't believe, you don't have a hope. I didn't play against South Africa. A lot of people think that was a tough time for me, but I was given a role to perform for the team, and I did my job, so it was great. I will never forget that. It's my best memory. I'll never forget that day for the rest of my life. Eddie Jones and his Japanese team believed. You know, they worked to that one focused goal for so long. That instilled the belief. It instilled something deep down inside that comes from being so very focused on one mission, one purpose. And that ultimately is what enabled them. And to the point, it is absolutely about the drivers of belief that make it all happen. Well, to me, the most amazing thing of the World Cup was after we beat South Africa, the next game we played against Scotland. 30 million people in Japan watched on television. That's one in every four people in Japan. And so the effect that one sporting team can have on the nation in engendering a sense of optimism, it's a fantastic thing that the players did for the country. And I think the country will always be proud of them. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC] Other sports, these upsets happen. In Rugby Union, they don't. But this Japanese team found a way to cause the greatest upset in sporting history. [MUSIC]
