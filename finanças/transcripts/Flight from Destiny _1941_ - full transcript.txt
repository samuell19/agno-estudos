Good morning. - Morning. Pardon me. Could you do something about this door. What is the matter with it? - It's turning around too fast. It turns as fast as the people push it. But I would like it to go slow. How slow? - Very slow. Look, mister. I can't hold up the wheels of progress just for you. People must go in and out of here in a hurry. You don't understand. I am a sick man. The speed of that door might very well cause me to have a fainting spell. Now, that fainting spell would probably last five minutes. A crowd would doubtless gather. It would take another five minutes to disperse them before I could be revived. Well now, that is a minimum of at least ten minutes. But if you allow me to go through there alone I can do it in a half minute. And from a mathematical point of view .. That is a saving to you of nine and a half minutes. Philosophically speaking .. - Never mind, mister. You can go through just as slow or as fast as you like. Just a minute, folks. Step back please. Step back .. step back. Okay, mister. - Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. You're sure you did everything I asked you to, Henry? Oh, to the letter. Absolutely no physical exertion. I walked one inch at a time. And when I ate I moved the spoon to my mouth at slow intervals. I even laid awake at night to avoid tossing in my sleep. I am glad you can still joke about it. Well you forget, Larry. You are a doctor and I am a philosopher. I am able to view even my own illness in its broader aspects. In its relation to humanity as a whole. In fact, I have a theory. Well, Larry? It's rather hard to tell you, Henry. Oh. Well .. If it's as difficult as all that I will save you the job. I am going to die soon. Is that what you have to tell me? How did you know? I've been doing a little enquiring on my own. I have an advanced stage. Of an aortic aneurysm. There is absolutely no cure for it. Diagnosis correct? Absolutely. If you knew about it why did you come to see me? Oh. I came to you to find out just how much time I had left. Oh, don't worry. There won't be any pain. When it comes, it will come quickly and mercifully. But when? When will it come? That's what is important to me, Larry. You see. I'm planning to write a book. I've been making notes on it for years. And I want to find out whether I have time to write it. How long would it take? About two three years. How long? Six months at the most. It will take that long to do the introduction. If you had come to see me sooner, maybe I could have done something about it. And if you suffer any severe emotional or physical shock. The end will come ever quicker. Yeah, I'll be careful. I don't have to tell you how I feel about this, Henry. I know that. Thanks. I wish you'd come to see me in a week or so and let me have a look at you. Yes, I will. It does seem a shame though, doesn't it. Such an interesting book. Sort of a .. A compendium of .. Human knowledge. Well. I suppose I ought to be grateful that I can continue teaching. Look here, Henry. It will be horrible to have to sit around and just wait. Goodbye, Larry. Goodbye, Henry. You know, Larry. You ought to study philosophy. It comes in handy at a time like this. Now to tackle that door again. Get me Dean Summers of Sylvan University on the phone. No. No. Absolutely no. My decision is final. We can't afford to take any chances. But don't you see it's like telling me I cannot eat anymore or sleep or breathe. Teaching has become as much a part of me as those things. Take it away and it is like leaving me in a state of suspended animation. I must have something to do. But man alive, you might keel over right in the classroom. What if I do? It is like a soldier dying on the battlefield. Don't you think a classroom is the logical place for me to die? The logical place for you to die is in your bed. I will have no dying in classrooms in my college. I won't have people saying we were too miserly to take care of you .. During your last few months on earth. Why, if such a story were spread our enrolment would drop in half. Oh. That is what you are worrying about. Well, naturally. And it would worry you too if you were running this college. I see. Yes. That is very important. Well then, you should welcome the opportunity this gives you .. To live the rest of your life calmly. In serenity. Surrounded by your books. Looking out of the window of your study as the world passes you by. Watching the seasons change. I've only got time to watch one season change. Well, even so. I envy you, Todhunter. When my time comes and it will, as it must to all men. I can think of a no more idyllic way in which to die. Now, you do as I say. I have arranged for everything. Nurses, doctors. Etc, etc. The college will meet all expenses including your funeral. Oh, I didn't mean to say that. I am sorry. You needn't be. I am glad you did. It isn't often a man is privileged to talk about his funeral. What kind will it be? Simple but dignified. The kind I know a man of your taste would like. A musical selection by the school orchestra. A drill by the gym class? If you wish. A short eulogy. Delivered by me. Well, I can't say that I like that. I spoke at Professor Haskell's funeral. Everybody thought it was magnificent. I didn't. I thought it was too sentimental. As Dean, it is proper that I deliver the eulogy. It is my funeral. But we are paying for it. That is true. I tell you what we'll do. We'll compromise. You can speak the eulogy, but I will write it. Don't let it worry you. I won't praise myself too highly. Just here and there. That sounds reasonable. You will send it to me in plenty of time so I can learn it? Of course. Don't you think it would be less expensive .. If you just had me stuffed and mounted right away? I am overlooking your remark. I realize the mental strain you are under. Now, you go home. And die in the manner befitting the dignity of the university. No, no, Dean Summers. I refuse to be put in a shop window with a label on me reading .. "This man is living and dying through the courtesy of Dean Somers". If I can't find something to justify the few months I have left. I assure you, Dean Summers. It will give me great pleasure to stand on your front doorstep .. At high noon in full view of everybody .. And put a bullet through my brain. Good day, Dean Summers. Good day, sir. Professor Todhunter. I forbid you to do that! Professor! Professor Todhunter, I forbid you! I absolutely forbid you! Is that you, Professor? - Yes, Martha. I'll be right in. Don't hurry. Good evening, Stubby. Thank you, Stubby. Come on. I'll give you a little present. Here we are. Were you a good boy today? This is a fine time to be coming home. I had your tea ready an hour ago. Well, you will just have to the muffins. The scones are all cold. Where have you been anyway? - I took a walk around the campus. Well, it is almost six o'clock. Nearly dinnertime. What are you snivelling about? Caught a cold? No. - Then what is it? I've just been talking to Eleanor Brown. And who is Eleanor Brown? Professor Martin's housekeeper. - Oh. She says the Dean's housekeeper told her she heard the Dean tell Mr Nichols .. That you were going to give up teaching and leave the college. Good news travelled fast, doesn't it. It isn't true, is it? You weren't fired, were you? Oh no, no. They just feel that I have worked long enough. I am getting too old. Too old? Why, I never heard anything as silly in my life. I will go and talk to the Dean about it. It isn't silly, I am, Martha. I am tired. I believe I will enjoy doing nothing for a while. No brandy, please. No brandy? The first time in 22 years you have not had a wee drop of brandy in your tea. And no tea. No tea? Now listen, Professor. Are you trying to hide something from me? A slim chance I'd have of doing that with you snooping around. Looking in my appointment book. Listening at the extension. Prying and spying. And what would happen to you if I didn't? I know, but you don't have to constantly .. Have you ever thought about it? - It's a very tough question, Professor. Yes, I wouldn't know how to answer it. I'd have to know more about the man. Young or old? Of course I realise how difficult it is .. To place yourselves in the position of a man who's only going to live six months. But I do wish you'd try. Professor, may I ask why you are so interested in this problem? Is it for your book? - My book? Oh yes, yes. I am doing as special chapter on the .. mortality of man. Well now, Professor. What exactly is the problem? Technically speaking, I am concerned with the problem of a man. Let's call him "X". Who is faced with an irrefutable fact. He is going to die within six months. What would he do? What would you do? - Yes Ferrers, what would you do? Well, I .. If I were quite sure there was no hope I think .. I think I would kill myself. Would you? What would be your reason? I am alone. I don't think my death would matter very much to anybody. And I don't think six months would make very much difference to me. But I don't think I could stand the torture of waiting to die. Very interesting. What do you think, Ferrers? I don't want to die. I hate the thought of it. If I had just six months to live. I would do all the things I've always wanted to do. First, I think I would travel. - Run away, you mean. Not exactly, Why do you say that? Take it easy. Now, now gentlemen. It is merely a hypothetical case. Go on, Ferrers. Most people postpone the things they want to do most. I'm the same way. If I were face to face with a deadline I would do those things. Try to crowd it all in. Use every precious moment. I don't agree with either of you two guys. As a matter of fact I think you are both lying. I know what I would do and you would do the same thing. I'd get myself a dozen cases of the best bourbon. And I'd call up twelve of the most beautiful blonds I know. And I would .. You would do the same thing. That isn't very different from the way you've been living all along. Well maybe, but this time I'd concentrate. Excuse me, gentlemen. Professor, why don't you ask George? George. - Yes, sir? What would do if you had only six months to live? Pardon me, gentlemen. I have to finish dusting. Don't go. We are serious. What would you do? What would I do with only six months to live? Yes. Oh, that is too soon for me. - Come on, now. Tell us the truth. Well sir, there is 24 rooms in this club. There's ten ashtrays in every room. I've been emptying ashtrays every day six days a week. 52 weeks a year. For 14 years. And I only had six months to love. I'd take all them ashtrays and dump 'em on the floor. And grind them butts up in the carpet. Yes, sir. That's what I'd do. Grind 'em up in the carpet. And let somebody else clean 'em up. Professor, you haven't given us your opinion. What would you do? Yes. That's right, Professor. What would you do? Well .. I am not sure. But. I think I would like to do something that might of some benefit to society. I have it, Professor. Yes, Peterson? Commit a murder. - Murder? What do you mean? That's a strange statement, Peterson. Just how would a murder benefit society? By eliminating someone who's a menace to it. For instance? - I can think of some people. Wait a minute. I think I see what he means. Someone like a dictator. Ah, just a moment, gentlemen. A dictator is a symbol. His death wouldn't be of any benefit to society. Without the death of the system that created it. Well, what about a blackmailer? - Or a poison pen writer? No, no. Those are crimes punishable by law. I'm not talking about ordinary lawbreakers. Haven't you sometime known or met someone you felt deserved to be killed? Why did you hesitate? For fear of your own death. With only six months left to live there is nothing to stop you. I see. I see. A socially useful murder. That's right. Well, granting that premise there is a lot in what he says. No, no. I'll still stick to the blonds. Well, gentlemen. Very interesting. Thank you. Goodnight. - Goodnight, sir. The boys at the club all have different ideas about what I should do. I listened to all of them. Assn they were interesting. - Step behind this screen, Henry. Yes. Is this alright? Yes. That's fine. Well. As I was saying. They were interesting. But the most intriguing idea came from Peterson. He suggested that I commit a murder. Hmm. What is that? I said he suggested that I commit a murder. A murder? - Uhuh. Oh, murder? Just like that? Well. A socially useful murder. What exactly is that? A socially useful murder would be one .. That would rid the community of a person who is a menace to it. That is a pretty bloodthirsty idea. Besides, if I remember correctly .. We have laws which are supposed to deal with people who are a menace to society. That's true. But he was thinking of a person who commits a subtle .. insidious .. crime. And ought to be killed. But unfortunately cannot be touched by the law. Who is to the judge as to whether a man deserves to be killed or not? Me. You? - Yes. Who else is better qualified than a man who now has anything to gain or lose? Oh please, Henry. Come over here. - But don't you see, Larry? My motives would be absolutely beyond reproach. I see. Sit down. So you are going to be both judge and executioner? Yes. What gives you that right? The fact that I am immortal. Henry, what on earthy are you babbling about? I will explain. The idea of immortality occurred to me about a week ago. I discovered I no longer possessed the quality which makes most people mortal. That is: the fear of death. So, I reasoned that I was in a sense, immortal. That's a very profound deduction. Come over here. Having arrived at this conclusion I reasoned further .. There must be some social use to which I could put this lack of fear. Get up here, Henry. I examined all the things I could possibly do. But none seemed quite satisfactory until Peterson suggested committing a murder. That seemed to have good possibilities. I see. Because you consider yourself immortal you can do whatever you want? Rob, burn, kill. Commit any crime. A nice hobby. - Now Larry, that is not true. What I do can't be considered a crime as it will be for the benefit of society. Of all the poppycock I've ever heard. Do you realise what you are saying? Your theory is not only foolish, it is dangerous. Put it in the hands of some mentally unbalanced person and .. Now look here, Henry. This is just a theory of yours, isn't it? Of course. Of course. It is just a theory. Good evening, Professor. - Good evening. Oh, there you are. I am certainly glad you are home. What is the matter now? - Mrs Farroway is here. She has been waiting for you since 8 o'clock. Betty is here? Betty. Henry. I am so glad to see you. I'm glad to see you too. You and Michael have been neglecting me shamefully for months. Well, we haven't been going out very much lately. How is the youngster? - You wouldn't know him. That's fine. I .. hope you don't mind my breaking in on you like this. Of course not. I am just going to have some tea. Come on. Let's sit over here. I'm sorry you had to wait so long. If I had only known you were coming .. Oh, Stubby looked after me. Now let me have a look at you. A little thin, aren't you? What have you been doing with yourself? Just the usual things. - How is Michael? Working hard? Betty. What is the matter? Michael. He isn't ill, is he? - No. Well then, what's wrong? I'm losing him. He hasn't left you? No. But he might just as well have. Well, when did all this happen? About six months ago. Just after the baby's illness. I began to have a feeling that .. Something had a hold on him, that he was drawing away from me. Well. I wouldn't let that bother me. Michael is a painter. An artist, and can't be judged by ordinary standards. He may be busy with some work important to him. He hasn't painted in months. Of if he has I haven't seen it. He's asked me not to come to the studio anymore. Oh. That doesn't sound like Michael. - It isn't. Not the Michael that I've known for five years. Where is he now? He didn't come home last night. Has he ever stayed away before? Once. We had a quarrel. I don't even remember what it was about. He was gone for two days. Then when he came back, everything was alright for a while. But lately it has become impossible. I know that he is unhappy. Something is troubling him and sometimes .. I can feel him reaching out to me .. As if he were trying to tell me what it is. But he never does. I am frightened. I am terribly frightened. Betty, Betty. This won't do. Here, here. Whatever is wrong, this is no way to solve it. Betty. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to behave like this. You are the only one I can come to. You know he worshipped you. You're his favorite professor. Michael was my favorite pupil. I don't think Betty he would do anything to hurt you. Maybe he is just passing through a phase. Men do you know, especially husbands. I ought to know. I am a bachelor. I wish I could believe you. But I can't. I don't know how to explain what I feel. It's like .. Standing on the shore and watching someone you love sail away. You can still see him. He is still there. But he keeps getting smaller and smaller. And there's nothing you can do about it. Well. I'll tell you what we do. I'll see Michael. We'll have a good old-fashioned bull session. And don't you worry. We'll straighten this thing out. Now then. Feel better? Now, now. What in the world is that for? I love you very much. Come on, I'll take you home. - No, no, You needn't do that. But I would enjoy it. Come along. Martha. Martha. - I'm coming. It isn't often I can ride with a lovely lady in a taxi-cab. Martha. I am going out. - You are going out? Where? I am taking Betty home. - What about her tea? Oh, I forgot. Sorry. I'm afraid I have to go home. Yes. She will have to go home. - And you? What about your milk? You drink it. Come along, Betty. Now don't stay too long. It's after nine already. Driver, couldn't you have gone down another street? Sorry Pop, but they are all jammed up at his hour. Betty. Isn't that Michael? Yes, it is. Michael. - Hello, Ketti. And what are you doing here? - I have been waiting for you. I've got to talk to you, Ketti. Alright. But not here. Let's go to my apartment. - No. No, I'd rather not. Michael, what is the matter? The painting. I cannot go on with it. You let me worry about that. I'll take care of everything. No. I am serious. I have made up my mind. Alright. Let's talk it over, but over a drink. Come on. Do we have to sit here? Driver, let's get out of here. We're moving out. Good day. How do you do, sir. How do you do. You have some very lovely things here. Thank you. Are you interested in the work of any particular artist? As a matter of fact I am. I wonder whether I could speak to Miss Moret about him? Certainly. This way please. You are a collector? - Well. Not exactly. I am a philosopher. But you know, I have always maintained there is a very distinct relationship .. Between philosophy and art. Don't you think so? No. This way please. I will tell Miss Moret you are here. Make yourself comfortable. Thank you, thank you. How do you do, sir? How do you do, Miss Moret? Yes. My name is Todhunter. Professor Henry Todhunter. I'm very pleased to know you, Professor. Thank you. I have been admiring the Francesca. It is magnificent. Absolutely magnificent. It must be a product of his dark period. You know Francesca's work? Up to a point. You see for a long time he painted in bright, vivid colors. Romantic style. And then suddenly the whole character of his work changed. Yes. What do you suppose happened to him? A woman entered his life. She caused him great unhappiness. Well, women have been known to do that, haven't they, Professor. Yes. May I ask how you obtained it? Yes. A friend of mine brought it from Europe. We consider ourselves fortunate indeed to own it. Oh yes. There can't be more than 7 or 8 in the whole world outside of the galleries. Perhaps you would like to own it, Professor? Indeed I would but I am afraid I cannot afford it. No. My mission in being here is .. Quite different. May I sit down? I am a little tired. - Please do. I am afraid I am getting to be an old man. You are a most attractive woman, Miss Moret. Thank you. You can't be a very old man, Professor. Oh. Dear me, I hope you don't misunderstand. Miss Moret. I have a very difficult task to perform. Yes? I am a friend of Michael Farroway's. Oh. Oh, how nice. As you know, Michael has a wife and a child. And as one who seems to be interested in painting. You must realise that Michael is a very talented artist. Talented, of course. That is what attracted me to him in the first place. Then would you consider it presumptuous of me if I asked you to give him up? Give him up, Professor? Why? I have no hold on Michael. I am only interested in his work. I want to help him. You're implying that your only interest in Michael is as a patron of the arts? Why, exactly. And your relationship with Michael has none of the .. Shall I say, personal element, in it? Of course not. I see. Then .. perhaps it would be better if you made your interest in Michael .. A little less intense. Whatever you say, Professor. I care enough about Michael's future not to want to do anything to destroy it. You are very kind. Yes. I am happy to hear you say that. You are not only an attractive woman, Miss Moret. But you are an understanding and extremely generous one. Well, I'll be running along. Oh by the way. Michael left home several days ago. And I wondered whether you had seen him. His wife is rather concerned. I think you will find him at his flat. Oh thank you. I am deeply grateful. Goodbye, Miss Moret. - Goodbye, Professor. Good afternoon, Professor. - Afternoon. Have you seen Mr Farroway? I think you'll probably find him in the bar. I'll have him paged for you. Thank you. George. Yes? Have you seen Mr Farroway? I seen him but I don't think he seen me. What is the matter with him? He done have six scotch and sodas. Without the soda. Hello, Michael. Hello, Professor. You are just in time to drink a toast. To the pride of Sylvan University. Care to join me? No thank you. Michael, don't you think you have had enough? I detect a note of disappointment in your voice, Professor. Your favorite pupil has let you down, hasn't he. Oh, not at all. Nothing of the sort. I was a little worried. That's all. Betty called. Told you I'd run out on her I suppose. No. She suggested I find you and have a talk with you. If you don't mind I don't want more lectures. Michael. I know what you are going to say. Betty is a lovely girl. I'm a talented young man. We've been very happy in five years of our marriage. It's true. I know it. There's some things that neither you nor Betty or anyone else can understand. Well, that is not very flattering to me, Michael. I am a philosopher and I have been deluding myself with the idea .. That I could understand almost anything. I am not a pupil in Philosophy 4A anymore and you are not my teacher. Of course not. But Michael, I'm not going to stand by .. And see you ruin something that has taken years to build. I am not a narrow-minded bigot. And I have more than the usual share of tolerance. And I don't altogether blame you for becoming .. Temporarily infatuated with a woman like Ketti Moret. It is not that. Then what is it? What is your problem, Michael? Tell me. Maybe I can help you. Nobody can help me. - Now, Michael .. Please. Let me alone. I am ashamed of you. Here you are, a man with everything in his favor. Family background, fine talent, a growing reputation. Yet you sit whimpering like a spoiled child wallowing in drink and self-pity. I don't want to hear any more. - That woman doesn't love you. She told me so! She told you? You mean you talked to her? - Yes. Who asked you to interfere? What right have you to discuss me and my affairs? Why don't you mind your own business you meddling old fool. I'm sorry. Hello, Michael. Michael. Well nurse, how is he? The doctor will tell you. He will be out in just a moment. Thank you. Henry. Henry. How is he? - He is going to be alright. Is he very badly hurt? - I hope not. We'll know in a moment. The doctor is now with him. How did it happen? - It was an accident. This man here was driving the cab. It wasn't my fault, lady. He acted like he was in a trance. The minute I seen him I stepped on the brakes but it was too late. We are not blaming you. - No, of course not. Why, I wouldn't want to hurt anyone .. How is he, doctor? He is undoubtedly hurt pretty badly. But if there are no internal injuries I don't think we have much to worry about. May I see him? I am his wife. Well, I'd rather you didn't. He's not fully regained consciousness yet. Please, doctor. Alright. Please don't stay too long. And don't try to talk to him. - No. No. I won't do it. It's wrong. - Michael. No. I won't do it. I won't. - Michael, darling. Please don't talk. Try to be quiet. Betty. Betty. Betty. The painting. The painting. You must get it back. Destroy it. Destroy it. I cannot go through with it. - Michael, please be quiet. Destroy it. - Be quiet. I can't go through with it. - Please, I think you had better go. Don't go. Stay Betty. Please. Stay Ketti, please. - Darling. Let him be. He doesn't know what he says. Don't leave me here. Don't let them keep me here. Poor Michael. If only there was something I could do to help him. Did you notice .. He said something about a painting he wanted to destroy. What do you suppose he meant? I don't know. Strange. Have you the key to his studio? - Yes. Would you take me there? Certainly. Very strange. Well, this looks familiar. Yes, sir. I have spent many pleasant hours here. These are all his old paintings, aren't they? Yes, most of them. That one was done about a year ago. That is about two years old. Yes. Yes, I recognise them. Beautiful. Very beautiful. They were reproduced in several of the magazines. Oh, it's a tragic thing to see talent go to waste. I don't understand it. Hasn't he done any new canvases? Well, look. This one seems to have been started fairly recently. Yes, The paint is still wet on it. A peculiar style for Michael, isn't it? It doesn't even look like his work. No. More like the earlier Italian. The 14th century painters. Oh, yes. The use of color and the brush strokes. You would almost think it was an old masterpiece by .. What? Do you know whether Michael has had a commission recently? To copy a Francesca? No. And I don't think he would accept it if he had. He has always hated imitation of any kind. I remember. What I really want to know, Mr Kreindling. Is just how exactly you determine the authenticity of a masterpiece? That is extremely difficult Professor Todhunter, but .. There are methods which we have found very reliable. Can you tell me what they are? Not at all. You see. In a manner of speaking every artist leaves his fingerprint on a canvas. Up to the beginning of the 18th century artists had to grind their own paints .. Weave their own canvases and cast their own nails to hold the frames together. That is very interesting. Now all these things can be determined by X-Ray or fluoroscope. Fakers can imitate everything except .. time. Time does things to wood and paint and canvases that no man on earth can do. I see. I understand. That is why I question the authenticity of the painting in Miss Moret's gallery. You mean you think Miss Moret has perpetrated a fraud? Well, I .. I dislike to criticise a competitor. But the lady in question claims she has discovered a secret store of Francescas. She sold the first one for an enormous sum of money. The second one hangs on her wall and .. Heaven only knows how many more she has stored in her vaults. I asked for the privilege of submitting them to the usual tests. And she refused. Miss Ketti Moret's real name is Petterina Moraciagos. She was married to a man named Walter Sender. He was a concert pianist. They had a child. About three years ago she got a divorce. You know where I could find the husband? He is playing downtown in a dive called Jim's Caf?. And the child? - She's in the county orphanage. Any other relatives? Yes. A mother, brothers and sisters. If you ask me, Professor. Ketti Moret looks like the sort of woman who might .. I will find out about her, Mr Pereti. Could you give me the mother's address? Yes. She works at 734 Morton Street. Can you tell me where I can find Mrs Moraciagos? I am Moraciagos. I would like to ask you a few questions. Mr Sender. You were married to her. Why did she leave you? I worked too hard. I became ill. When I lost everything, she left me. If I told you she were dead .. Would you mourn for her? I mourn .. Only for my child. Now tell me, my dear. Do you miss your mother? I don't remember my mother. "I wish she were dead." "She took every cent I had." "She walked out on me." "I hate her." I will be brief, Miss Moret. I have here a record of your whole life. It is a record of greed .. Selfishness and brutality. I think I know all there is to know about you. Your past. Your present. And probably your future. I hope it is an interesting one, Professor. Miss Moret. That depends entirely upon you. As for myself I cannot for the life of me see what use you are in the world. What purpose you serve other than an evil one. Or why you should continue to live. That is why I have come. To plead with you to do one thing. One decent act. To display one generous impulse. Anything. That will cause me to change my opinion of you. Professor. I am getting a little tired of your quaint attitude. You have no right to pry into my personal life. And what is more, I want you to stop. I have. I know .. all I need to know. The next move is up to you. What is this mysterious thing you want me to do? I want you to give a man back his self-respect. His freedom. His pride in his work. I want you to restore him to his family. And suppose I don't? Then, Miss Moret. Time and truth will have caught up with both of us. Did you know I was going to die? Aren't we all? - Yes. But with this difference. I am certain of my date. I am trying desperately not to be certain of yours. Goodnight, Miss Moret. I want you to go to her, Michael. Talk to her. Tell her you are through with her. Tell her you'll have no more to do with this deceitful scheme of hers. Tell her once and for all that you want to break off this shameful relationship. I don't know what you're saying. Michael, Michael. Why do you lie to me? I'm your friend. I'm trying to help you. Those Francescas. They were all painted by you. You can't prove it. I could prove it, Michael. Even though you did an excellent job of copying. It isn't true. - Michael. Do you realize if you continue this decadent affair you'll ruin your career? Disgrace your family. What do you want me to do? - I want you to tell the truth. Michael. Alright. I painted them. Why? I don't know why. It all seems like a nightmare now. It started by her praising my work. I suppose I was flattered by it. She led me to believe that she wanted to help me. She made me feel that I was struggling needlessly. I deserved much more than I had. This was an easy way to make money. I agreed. I couldn't help myself. - But you realized it was a mistake? Yes. Afterwards. Why didn't you break with her then? I suppose I was afraid to. Afraid? What were you afraid of? I don't know. Henry. You may think I am a coward and a weakling. I could see her and talk to her. But I know the minute I am with her I am completely at her mercy. My work. My family. I lose all sense of responsibility. I don't suppose you can understand that. - Yes. I understand it. It's why I tell you Michael, you must go to this woman to ask her to release you. Persuade her to destroy those paintings. She wouldn't agree. I know it. How can you tell? Perhaps if you appeal to her sense of decency? She doesn't know the meaning of the word. Michael. Go to this woman. Give her a chance to prove that there is some good in her. If not for yourself at least do it for my sake. For your sake? What do you mean? Don't ask me to explain. But Michael, you must go to her. Now. This very night. I must know. I am sure glad that is you. Why Libby, who did you expect? Nobody. But I've been hearing some funny noises around here. Did anybody call? - No, ma'am. Professor Todhunter? You mean the old gentleman who came the other evening? Uhuh. Well if he does, tell him I am not in. I don't want to see him anymore. - I sure will. And Libby, I am expecting Mr Farroway. When he comes you may go. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. That is him now. Show him in please. - Yes, ma'am. Good evening, Mr Farroway. Come right in. Good evening, Libby. I am sure glad to see you here again. Is Miss Moret in? - Yes, sir. She is waiting for you. Good evening, Michael. Hello. I am glad to see you. I am sorry I couldn't get to the hospital. But I was very busy. It is just as well. - Won't you sit down? No thanks. Why do you act as though you have never been here before? I cannot stay very long. My wife is waiting for me at home. We are making plans to go away. Before I go there's something you can do for me. It's very important to me, Ketti. To my future. To the happiness of my family. And what is that? You must tell the man who bought the painting that it is not a Francesca. But a fraud painted by me. Oh .. just like that? Yes. You have got to do it, Ketti. If I remember, you were quite willing to take the money I paid you for the work. I know. I'll pay you back every cent as soon as I can. But you must return the entire amount to the man who bought it. It is the only way I can clear myself. My whole future depends on it. Michael, your future is in my hands. And it is a very pleasant one. I did well on those two paintings of yours. I'm anxious to get the third one. There will be no third painting. I went to the studio before I came here tonight. I burnt it. That is too bad. You will have to start all over again. But then that is easy. You are so clever at it. Yes, Michael. I will continue to sell them. And we will continue to be very happy together. Not any more, Ketti. I have made up my mind. I am leaving the city tomorrow. I am through with you. You, the paintings and everything else. Oh no. You are not leaving tomorrow or any other day. And you know why? Because I don't want you to go. You can't stop me, Ketti. I am leaving, no matter what you say. I only hope you have the decency to do what I ask. Michael. Do you remember the case of a man called Crassius? He was a Dutch painter. Very talented. So talented he succeeded in copying a masterpiece .. And then selling it to The Metropolitan. Ha. Imagine fooling the curator of The Metropolitan Museum. What has that to do with me? Years later when they discovered the forgery they arrested him. The charge was grand larceny. They gave him ten years. And what did his accomplice get? He had no accomplice. Fortunately I had. If it's alright with you to spend ten years in prison, it's alright with me. Michael, you sold me those paintings. And I took the word of a distinguished artist that they were authentic. I am as much a victim of your fraud as the man who bought them. You will have a hard time proving that. I don't think so. If you recall, I once asked you to write me a letter describing the painting. And assuring me of its authenticity. I still have that letter. Once you tricked me into believing that you were in love with me. That you wanted to help me. I still do. Before coming up here I made up my mind not to plead with you. The only reason I am doing it now is because of my wife. I am not concerned with her. But I am. Ketti, I swear to you by everything I believe in. If you don't do as I ask you to. If you try to stop me from going back to my family .. I will kill you. Excuse me, Miss Ketti. I am going now. It is alright, Libby. Goodnight Mr Farroway. Goodnight, Miss Ketti. Goodnight. Well, Ketti. There is nothing else to say. You know how I feel about this. I hope you believe me. You shouldn't have done that, Miss Moret. It was so little he asked for. What are you doing here? How did you get in? I had a key made once. I wanted to be here when Michael talked to you. What gives you the right to come in here and spy on me? I wanted to see what you would do if you got another chance. You have been found guilty, Miss Moret. Guilty? What are you talking about? By whom? - By me. You must be mad. Get out of here before I call the police and throw you out. What are you trying to do? If only you had a reason. But you haven't. Everything you've done has been to feed your own selfish vanity. You have climbed to where you are over the bodies of people. Simple, innocent people. That is a crime against man and God. And you must be punished for it. No .. no, wait. I am everything you say I am. But I had to be. When you die no-one will weep for you. Not your mother. Nor your husband, nor our child. Nor any of the others you have destroyed. They all want you to die. I am only their instrument. You must believe that. I'm coming. I'm coming. Good morning, Mrs Farroway. - Is he in? Yes, he is inside. - Henry. Henry. Oh, I am so glad you are home. - What is the matter, Betty? Two detectives just came to the house and took Michael away. Michael? - Yes. That woman Ketti Moret was killed last night. They say that he did it. They have arrested him for murder. Arrested Michael? - Yes. Oh. Oh. I forgot that he .. - Forgot what? Oh, what will we do? Nothing, dear. It's quite alright. I will take care of it. I'll get him out right away. He couldn't have done it. It's impossible. Of course he couldn't. Wait here with Martha and don't worry about a thing. And I will be back. I'll have him out in no time. Martha. Martha! You take care of Betty. So then Professor Todhunter, you claim that you killed Ketti Moret? Yes, yes. Then why didn't you give yourself up last night? I intended to. But I was very tired and decided to rest. I didn't think one night could make much difference. Ah, but it did. You see, we already have the murderer of Ketti Moret. So you must have killed somebody else. Mr Johnson. I hardly think murder is a matter to joke about. I quite agree with you, Professor. You know, I think you are still in need of rest. Why don't you just go home and go back to bed? And the next time you kill somebody get here a little earlier. You know, here it's: first come, first served. Mr Johnson. There is my written confession. Every detail of the crime is mentioned. I haven't overlooked a single thing. Yes. I see you even had it notarized. - Yes. I wanted it all to be perfectly legal. And now will you release my friend? Farroway is a friend of yours? Of course. And he must be released immediately. He is innocent. If he is innocent you may rest assured he will be released. Thank you. Professor Todhunter. Accusing yourself of murder you know, is a serious thing. It is not nearly as serious Mr Johnson as accusing the wrong man of murder. You say in this confession that you shot her twice. Yes. And the gun you claim you shot her with? Do you have that with you? Oh. It is in my overcoat in an upstairs closet in my house. Shall I get it? No, we'll send for it. I still have a few questions I want to ask you, Professor. Yes? Professor Todhunter, perhaps you can tell me why you murdered this woman. My motive? - Yes. What was it? Robbery or an obsessional hatred? A crime of passion? Mr Johnson, I am 61 years old. Of course I realise my motive is difficult to explain. Yes, I imagine it would be. - You see, it wasn't an ordinary murder. My attitude towards the victim was at all times purely impersonal. Firstly, the idea was from a philosophic theory that I was, in a sense, immortal. And therefore perfectly justified in committing this particular murder. Yes. As I said, it would be difficult for you to understand. Oh .. here. There is the record of the whole thing. My theory clearly stated. A logical deduction of how I arrived at it. And a case history of Ketti Moret. Now Mr Johnson, if you will study that carefully .. You will see that there was nothing left for me to do but kill her. Oh, is that so? I think that should clarify matters, shouldn't it? Yes, I am sure this clears up the whole thing. You know Professor Todhunter .. I must say you're the most accommodating murderer I have ever met. You have saved us a great deal of trouble. Well, I hope I have convinced you, Mr Johnson. You have convinced me Professor Todhunter, of one thing. What is that, sir? That you are completely out of your mind. That you are insane. In short Professor Todhunter I think you are as crazy as a bedbug. Mr Johnson. You will have to prove that. Professor Todhunter, I will. Now, where does that one go? There. Are you satisfied now? - Not yet, Professor. Now, Professor Todhunter. Really, really. Is all this hocus pocus necessary? This light. The rest of the room in darkness? I could just as easily answer your questions in a more cheerful atmosphere. It is necessary, my dear Professor. I must have absolute concentration. - Oh, very well. So, according to your book you claim immortality. You claim the divine right to judge good and evil. Also, the divine right of taking a human life. Is that right? That is a fair synopsis, yes. Do you often have dreams? No. I am a very sound sleeper. Once in a while? Once in a very long while, yes. - What are they like? It depends on what I eat before I go to bed. Dreams are not the result of eating. They are the results of the subconscious. Well, there are two schools of thought about that, doctor. I am not here for a theoretical discussion. I am here to determine whether or not you are sane. Go ahead, doctor. Do you ever dream that you are a great person? That you perform great deeds? Here. If you're trying to prove that I had delusions of grandeur .. Never mind what I am trying to prove. Answer the question. Where did you go to school, doctor? - Paris. The Sorbonne. Did you ever dream that you committed an act of violence? You weren't a very bad student, were you doctor? I stood second in my class. Did you ever dream that you committed a murder? No. You haven't kept up with the times at all, doctor. Not at all. Mr Johnson. - Professor, please. I can't help it. The man is incompetent. If I were in your place I wouldn't accept his findings one way or another. This man is impossible. Impossible. Perhaps you know more that I do about this subject. Of course I do. Your approach is all wrong. It is unscientific. Perhaps you can do better? - Of course I could. This is a case for psychiatry, not for psychoanalysis. This man is trying to prove that I have delusions of grandeur. Hallucinations. In short, he is contending that I am a paranoiac. Well, that is a technique for a professional, not an amateur. Amateur? How dare you call me an amateur. Mr Johnson. I won't let this man insult me anymore. - Professor. Sorry. I'm not insulting you, doctor. It's just that you don't know your work. I am recognised the world over as the greatest psychiatrist in this country. Not by me. - Professor. Don't you see? He has the delusions of grandeur. Not me. I will sue you for libel. This is a conspiracy. This is a conspiracy. Ask anyone. They will tell you how great I am. Ask anyone! They will tell you. Now that man is really nuts. Yeah, but you are alright. - Yes, I am. And my patience is about exhausted. I know my rights as a citizen. And I demand that you release Michael Farroway .. And arrest me for the murder of Ketti Moret. Alright, Professor. I will arrest you. But you are not fooling me. You know you're going to die in a few months anyway. And you are taking upon yourself the guilt of a man you liked very much. You went to that apartment. You found that gun. You wiped off his fingerprints and substituted your own. Oh, nonsense! You didn't read my book very carefully. - Yes, I did. But now that I am convinced that you are sane I don't believe a word of it. Michael Farroway is guilty of the murder and I will do everything in my power .. To bring him to trial for it and see he gets the chair. No. No, no. You mustn't do that. You can't. You can't do that. Extra! Extra! I want to speak to Professor Todhunter, please. He will send Michael to the chair. Larry. You are the only one who can prevent it. You are the only who can prove that I am guilty. You have got to help me. But how can I do that, Henry? Go to the District Attorney. Tell him I discussed this crime with you. That it was planned in advance. That it was premeditated. That I did it. But I don't believe you, Henry. I don't believe you would ever kill anyone. Larry. We've been friends for a long time. And I tell you this in all seriousness. I committed that murder. And you are asking me to give testimony that would send you to the chair? You have got to do it. If I am responsible for the death of an innocent man .. It would be as though I had murdered him too. Don't you see? No, Henry. I won't do it. Larry. I am not afraid of any penalty they might impose upon me. I have already stood before the highest tribunal. And heard my sentence pronounced. You know that. Now, please. Will you do as I ask you to? Alright, Henry. Thank you. Professor Todhunter. There is something I want to say before pronouncing sentence upon you. I hope that somewhere in eternity there is a punishment that avenges society .. For your presumptuousness in daring to judge any member of it. Yours is a horrible crime. A crime without passion and without reason. I also hope the theory you expound dies with you. Henry Todhunter, having been found guilty of murder in the first degree .. As charged in the indictment. It is the judgement of this court. That you be remanded to the custody to the warden of the state penitentiary. To be put to death in the electric chair. During the week of March 14th. And may God have mercy on your soul. Professor, you have got company in the parlor. Parlor? - Yes. The visitor's room. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. This way. Alright. Betty. Michael. Henry. Oh now Betty, Betty. No tears, please. There is nothing to cry about. Sit down, both of you. You sit down, Henry. Thank you, Michael. I want to talk to you. You didn't come here to make me unhappy. You came to cheer me up, didn't you? Well now, that's better. Michael, did you see the man who bought your first painting? Yes, I did. - What did he say? When I told him that I had forged the painting he said he couldn't believe it. That after all his years of experience in buying masterpieces .. He has no business being taken in by an imitation. It was a blow to his pride. - Isn't he going to prosecute? No. He seemed to take the whole thing very lightly. I offered to pay him whatever I earned in the future. He refused that too. I don't understand. - Well you see, he said that .. He could afford the money but Mike could not afford to go to jail for ten years. He said it as better for him to go on painting. Now, isn't that grand? He sounds like someone I should have known. I am so glad for both of you. I don't know how to find the words to say this but .. It is all so wrong. It is so terribly unfair. What is unfair? Because it is my fault. If I hadn't gone to your house that night this would never have happened. I can't bear to think that you have got to go through all this just for us. You think I did this just for you and Michael? And you don't believe the reasons I gave for killing that woman? That it was socially necessary? No. How could I? And you, Michael. Do you feel the same way? Yes I do, Henry. Oh well, that is too bad. I was sure you would understand. I only understand one thing. You are here in this place. Alone and tired and .. With murder on your conscience. And the rest of your life could have been so peaceful and beautiful. But I didn't want it that way. That would have been so dull and uninteresting. I have always thought of a man's life .. As a work of art. The virtue of a work of art .. Is that when it is finished. There is nothing left to be said and nothing left to be done. As for my life. What I had to say I have said. What I had to do .. I have done. Now, if you don't mind. I will go back to my cell. Guard. When do they take me to the .. The place where the execution occurs? The state prison? That is first thing in the morning. And just what is the procedure? It is all very simple. You go out of here handcuffed to an officer. Go out through the head keeper's office. Down the flight of steps to the street and there will be a car waiting for you. I see. - Then off you go. Thank you. - That's alright, Professor. Hello Larry. - Well, Henry. Well this is nice. Sit down. Sit down. I am glad to see you. How are you, Henry? - Oh, fine. Fine. Everything is very pleasant. The guards are considerate. The prisoners treat me with respect. In fact I find the whole thing rather interesting. You shouldn't be smoking, you know. Why not? A man already in the water needn't worry about getting his feet wet. I still can't believe it. Henry, how could you? - Now, now. Larry. Don't you worry about me. I did what I did because I thought it was right. And I still do. So let's not talk any more about it. Hmm? Alright. Is there anything I can do for you? - I can't think of a thing. I have everything I want. It is all so horrible. What, Larry? The chair. - Oh. I've figured that out too. I am not going to die in the electric chair. The first thing in the morning they take me out of here to the state prison. Well. Now look. Here is a drawing of this building. As you can see, from the building to the street is this long flight of stairs. As they take me down the stairs I'll make a break for it. Naturally, it will be a struggle. And I will exert myself very much. Well, as much as I can. And then. Well. That should do it, shouldn't it Larry? I didn't expect you to answer that. You have always been a very poor liar, Larry. Sorry. Time is up. Well. You'll have to be running along, Larry. Goodbye. - Bye. Take it easy. Take it easy! Take your hands off me. I can walk. Don't get tough, son. Do as you're told. Yeah. Relax, fellah. Relax. Don't have keep shoving me around. - You have been asking for it. Now settle down, son. You are going to be with us for a long while. Captain. What is the matter with that young man? That is someone you ought to know, Professor. He is a pupil of yours. A pupil of mine? I don't understand. Explain it to him. His name is John Saunders. He is charged with first-degree murder. And he has just confessed to robbing and killing an old man in cold blood. When the district attorney asked him why he did it, he said he had the right to. He showed him a newspaper clipping he carried in his pocket. That clipping was all about your theory, Professor. The right to kill. Saunders, you can tell him the rest of it. Young man. What he said. It isn't true, is it? Yes, it is true. You robbed and killed because of my theory? Sure. I didn't know what to do. I was all set to kill myself when I read what you said. But you didn't understand. 0h yes, I did. I figured it out step by step. But couldn't you see that what I did was something else? Couldn't you see the difference? Difference? No. There's only one difference between you and me. You've got a way out and I haven't. Better get up, Professor. You are leaving in ten minutes. I will be ready. Alright, Professor. Time to go. Thank you. Thank you. So long, Professor. Goodbye, Eddie. "And so my dear Larry, this meeting with the murderer Saunders." "Convinced me of the fallacy of my theory." "And of the enormity of my crime." "My assumption that I was immortal because I lacked fear was wrong." "Saunders lacked fear too." "He was as sure of his death as I was of mine." "The only difference was that my death was caused by a physical disease." "His by a social maladjustment." "The second fallacy that I found was my belief .." "That my crime was a justifiable one." "Because my victim deserved to die." "Here in the death house is a group of men." "All of whom feel .." "The same way about the people that they have killed." "I bear a curious kinship to all murderers." "They too set themselves up as judges over life and death." "My sin was a mortal one." "That is why, my dear Larry." "I didn't choose to avail myself of the opportunity to avoid my punishment .." "That day on the prison steps." "For if my sin was a mortal one." "My punishment must be the same as all other mortals receive." "Therefore I choose to die in the electric chair." "I hope to continue my research into immortality." "In a laboratory that is much better equipped." "That is .." "If they let me in." -(t-g)-
