Perhaps I'd lightened your pockets earlier, Sir Lancelot? The best knight won. You mean "king." Not until I find a queen. Not if I find her first. Join us tomorrow. I hear Lady Vortigone is going. I'd rather not be cursed by your forgotten conquests. Tides coming in. Let's get back. Still telling bedtime stories, my Lord? Young Modred needs a mother. A father's love only goes so far. Night draws in. Lancelot. Do you hear that? Over there. Stay with the horses. What were you saying about a bride? Wait. Good lady, show thyself. My lady. This is no place for one so gentle. Come. Lancelot. You're welcome. That voice. A spell. Think of it no more. Come. Arthur married Guinevere and she became the queen he always desired. He then spent the better part of eight years fighting a group of bloody battles against the Romans. He took his bravest Knights with him to save Camelot. Leaving his son, Modred, in charge. After winning the battle in Rome, Arthur, tormented from the torturous and gruesome battle, now rests with his knights in France. Ooh. Go on! That's it, he's down. - Watch out! - Ooh, whoa! Hold him, hold him! Do you concede? - Do you concede? - I concede. Let's go. Let's go. Step back. Step back. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, get up your hand. Not bad for an old drunk. Who you calling old? I trust you had time to sleep on my proposal? Camelot, my Lord. Oh, yes. Camelot. Not for me. Word comes south of a Saxon threat. We cannot expect young Mordred to lead our country into battle. He has the knights, what more does he need? An army is nothing without his father's guidance, the king's guidance. There is no king without Excalibur. It is not the sword that made you, Arthur. Its abandoned you, because you abandoned yourself. Arthur, it's time to go home. Look around, my friend. Huh? We're already home! Now's your chance, good sires. Arthur, the sword puller. King of the Britons. This is no king. This man fights like a blacksmith. If he's a king where Is his army, huh? We are his army. What? Good. Prove yourselves, eh? Give your children something to be proud of! My children are not yet born, but the way he fights, I fear they never will be. With a face like yours I have the same fear. You? I can't fight you. I do not want to fight you. But I'll have you on your back quicker than any man. And you wanted to go home, eh? Oh, to be king, eh? Lucky bastard. It's not luck, good Tristram. You wanna stop licking his ass? He might learn to wipe it himself. My lord, do I not please you? Lay with me. It's all I ask. And put your clothes back on. I'd have thought a dagger in the back would be more your style. Come, my lady, this is an evening for revelry. Don't be sour with me. The nobles are gathered, Sir Mordred. Thank you, Tomas. I'll be along. Less meekness, my lady. It is not becoming of such a graceful creature. I'm neither your lady nor your creature. Don't go anywhere. Brother Cedric. Bless you, my child. If anyone should be blessed, it is I. Bless me. You're blessed. Sit, my lords, sit. Rest your weary souls. Fetch more wine. Wench their thirsts, why don't you? My lord, we are not here for your wine. Or your wry observations. We understand you have business with us, my lord. It is not far from here. The place where they grow the grape. You should taste it, lord Bedivere. The business at hand, sire. Taste it. It's good, is it not? Thick. The business, sire. - King Arthur is still... - Lord Arthur. Who sits on the throne? Camelot has no throne. Our king takes his seat at the table, equal to all his knights. And where are these knights? Where is this table? Do you see it? My Lord. The table has been destroyed. Not by me, of course. By my woodsman. He refused at first but then I threatened decapitate him with his own axe, so... Arthur has abandoned us. And for what? War mongering opportunists. He fights for honor. This wench has more honor. He fights for Camelot. He fights for himself! He fights for himself. Arthur, wake up. We are under threat, my lords. A Saxon army masses on the other side of the water. And our king, your king, my father, has abandoned us. He has left us to the wolves. Where is the honor in abandonment? Where is the honor in neglect? But now the war in Rome in over. Arthur will be back amongst us soon. Before or after the Saxons have spiked your head onto the gatepost of your hall? - He would not abandon us. - He already has. Vortigone. Skulking again. Not skulking, Agravain. Listening. Perhaps you should try it. One day it might save your life. Lord Modred is right. These are dangerous times. Thanks to your so called lord. Dangerous times, indeed. Easy. This one's mine. We will break bread with our Saxon enemies, not bone. Embrace me, lords, this is our new world. I will not be a part of this. We must let Camelot die so that we may live. I would rather die than let that happen! Easier said than done. Or is it? Arthur trusted you. All the more reason to call him a fool. - This is treason. - No. This is loyalty. Who's with me? Who's with me?! What's the matter, never seen a real woman before? Few that try to hurt me. Sorry about your friend. Not now, Arthur. Who sent you? Tell me who sent you or I'll slit your throat. I very much doubt that. Who sent you?! You really have no idea, do you? No. Quite the voice she has. Fit for an angel. You tell me she lives. As much as one can live as a prisoner. Lord Modred does enjoy his treats. You're going to find a boat. Soon as you can, sail to England. Take a horse directly to Camelot. I've a message for you to deliver. I'm not some errand girl. What makes you think I would do that? At least your friends were dead when they lost these. How do you expect me to deliver your message if I can't talk? Tell Modred to release her, or his tongue will be the least of his worries. If you succeed, you'll live a rich, fruitful life. I'll make sure of it. Alright. We'll be right behind you. My own blood. Modred is but a boy. A murderer. And he's making a play for Camelot. My dear Guinevere. If he's laid a finger on her. I'll kill him where he stands. Modred's influence stretches farther than is safe. Percival, send a bird ahead. Tell Bedivere to gather a handful of men. Only the most loyal at the table. Your most loyal men are here in this room. Tis not enough. Send the bird. Tell them to ready themselves and wait. We head for the coast immediately. Thank you. Thank you. I do not charge for my company. Trust Guinevere knows none of your vices, my lord. Call me not your lord. You'd prefer an insult? I'd have preferred if I had let one of my men be killed. Tis not your fault, Arthur. It's hardly the behavior of a king. How you lust for my bloodline. Na√Øve. Just like your husband. You know not what he's capable of. Dead men are but dust, my Queen. Capable of nothing. I understand your affection for Arthur ran deep? Until he turned his cheek from mine. I've never had any need for friends, my lady. It is not friendship I offer. But I can give you my mind. Of what use is that? How am I supposed to eat that? Travels west. You ned wit about you. When your father does return. He'd be a fool. That he would, my lord. Stand up, you bloody fools. Welcome home. Up I tell you. We're not home yet. Which way are we headed, my lord? The safest way. Lead on. Is that all, Sir Bedivere? I'm afraid so. Not like you to show up, Sir Lucan. Oft found ducking the fight. Are you not? Behave, Sir Tristram. Where are the others? Tell me my father's dead. You will find my father and you will return him to me. I know not where they ride. Vortigone! The girl needs your assistance. Show her Arthur's path. And if you fail me again, I will slay your peasant family and leave them to rot in their decrepit hole. Is that understood? I shall not fail you, my lord. Where's it taking us? I know not. Camelot? Not yet. Are we stopping, Lancelot? I've a rumbling in my stomach. We'll eat when the bird stops. Good to see you, my lord. We always prayed for your return. The war was long. Camelot has suffered greatly in your absence, my lord. You should count yourselves lucky. You won a great victory, Arthur. If you say so. Halt. Where did it go? Highness. I could get used to that. You might have to. The great sages of the past kept their secrets close. But it is written? There is a volume alluding to it. Legally binding? Follow the scripture, my lord, and you are the law. Bugger that. I'm not going in there. I've been in worse places. I don't want to hear about your failed female conquests, Percival. There's magic in there. Look at it! I'd sooner dip my cock in a witch's cauldron. Quiet! Arthur, come to me. I want you. We go on. Really? Arthur, I've been waiting for you, my King. Come to me. This way. Are you sure, my lord? No such thing. Walk on. Arthur. - Come here. - No! I've been waiting... Wait. Tether you horses. We'll make camp here tonight. Bedivere, I'll leave the fire to you. Lucan, Branor find us some meat for the pots. Aye. Proper scran. And get some rest. When your bellies are full, I will need your counsel. Is there a problem, my lady? I sense an unease. A belief or longing, perhaps? Yes, yes. That's what it is. False hope. Alas, your ignorance won't save your so-called king. If that treacherous bastard does make it back to Camelot... he will die by my hand, and you will bow to me, your eternal king. You, my Queen. My whore. Night after night, on your knees by my throne. At my wish. We should be riding for Camelot now. I don't understand why we're still here. You ever needed to question your king before, Sir Tristram? I question not his wisdom, Bedivere, merely his intentions. A dark shadow now rests on his heart. Sir Branor, your lands are closet to Camelot. Tell us what we may expect. Modred waits for the Saxons. Yet without them by his side, you still failed to protect the throne. We were too few, Sir Tristram. They needed us. And where were our brothers when we needed you against the Romans? Protecting our families. You made safe your own lands while the heart of England rotted. That's enough, Tristram. Modred's treachery was unforeseen. The nobles who follow him are ruled by fear and greed. And how would you know that, Sir Lucan? Slander. I said that's enough. I merely speak what we all feel. - Tristram! - These cowards seem like they don't wanna fight at all! Enough! Waste not energy mourning the unknown. Merlin. Walk with me, Arthur. I told you this place was magic. You're distracted from your cause. That poison doesn't help. What is my cause, Merlin? You need not me to answer. I fought a war and can't even remember why. I sent ten thousand men to their deaths. And the reason has been lost. What better reason than home. A home I have not protected. Tavern fights, laying with women I cannot recall. Only a fool would call me king. Your men are no fools, Arthur. Their own men, not mine. I hear them. Their gossip. Fear is what you hear. Of losing their leader. No leader would fail to raise a loyal son. Modred shares your blood, Arthur. Not your destiny. Excalibur was my destiny. Even that abandoned me. And it will return to you when you are ready. What if I'm never ready. Then you pretend to be until you are. Your King! Whom do you serve, Sir Tristram? I serve you, my lord. To my dying day. And you've forgotten who you are. We've all forgotten who we are. We kneel on ancient ground. Sacred ground. This is the Circle of Avalon, where the very code that we live by was born. You are wrong to bow to me. Your duty is to Camelot, my lords. Your duty is to each other. Our duty is to each other. Rise. Rise from your knees. Take each other by the arm. And remember who we are. Remember what we stand for. What we fight to uphold. Rise and remember we are more than men. We are knights, chosen to protect a kingdom. Chosen to protect a people, chosen to protect Camelot. We are more than men. We are more than brothers. We are knights of the Round Table. Keep your wits. I... I knew not what to do. What did you see? Who did this? The woman, sir. My lord, I... I failed him. I failed you. Any others? No, sir. Tristram. Bedivere. Seek her out, return her alive. Modred has made his move. Now we must make ours. Nothing, my lord. It is not without reason. One by one she will hunt us. Until she has me alone. Our queen can wait no more. My lord. Tell Vortigone I want to be wed by the week's end. Mordred has imprisoned the Queen and captured the throne. Time waits not for us. You travel on foot. "You?" Why not we? I cannot risk losing more men. I shall travel alone. We're two days out from Camelot. We must travel undetected. - My lord. - On foot, I said. No horses? No horses. We must be vigilant. Take the road less travelled. If anything separates us, we will find each other again, under our castle's hill, as the sun dips into the ocean on the second day. Great tragedy is coming. Such are the spoils of war. Yet we fight on. For Camelot. For Branor. For Branor. Away with the horses. Up early, Sir Lancelot. I'll sleep when Camelot is safe. I need you to head West. To Mythr. I chance you'll find Sir Kay there. Tell him to gather as many true men as he can, and meet us at the castle hill. My lord, we have marched side by side since we left these shores. I'm not about to leave you now. You're not leaving me. You're following an order. My lord. You're a good man, Lancelot. My loyalist of friends. As long as you are king, what I am has no bearing. He won't last, you know. This new nailed god of yours. I'm not sure he's going to take hold in Britain. Is there something I can help you with, my lady? Our Lord Modred is getting wed. Congratulations. In the eyes of the church? So he intends. I was not aware his beliefs fit to the Christian faith. He looks to please the Saxons. Who's the fortunate lady? Queen Guinevere. The heart wants what the heart wants, Brother. But she is already wed to our king. Not in the eyes of the church. I cannot believe Queen Guinevere would have part in such a fa√ßade. She will do as her king commands. This is treason. Think sensibly, Brother Cedric. You will see that Modred is wed and you will crown him king. Only a fool would try to take Arthur's throne. Only a heretic would kill a monk. You must be tired. I'm used to marching, Young Alexander. Though, a horse never goes a miss. I don't mean that, I mean tired of fighting. It's what we do. What was it like? Rome? We never made it into the city, but I heard stories. No doubt you did, too. What about the battles? They fought with honor. Unlike our Saxon friends. Should I fear the Saxons? Saxons fight like animals, Alexander. Like feral wolves. They'll eat you alive given half the chance. Modred's guards are worse. Calm down, Sir Lucan. You'll scare the lad. Nothing wrong with a bit of fear. Don't trouble yourself, young 'un. We don't often lose. Go on. These fish know not their suffering. Their destiny is not their own. Such is there place, young Modred. You used to bring me here as a child. Do you remember? It's funny, isn't it? The queen of Camelot and yet she does not even love the future king she is to wed. You will marry me. Or I will kill you. But first you will provide me with an heir. Do you think you're a worthy king? Even Modred is wrong about you. He thinks you're a traitor. But the truth is, you're nothing more than a murderer. Where were you when my father was fighting to keep Camelot safe? I offer a thousand thanks to your father, on behalf of all of Camelot. But forget the other thousand slain. Whilst you drank your ale and ravaged your women. And now just because your whore wife is in danger you see fit to return. You know nothing. I fight only to protect our land and our queen to whom my heart belongs. I fight for my father! Let me go. I shall right your suffering. Not just me that has suffered. It was my choice, tou'd be dead already. I must keep my end of the bargain. Does everyone enjoy pain as much as your queen? Do not tempt me to show you. I need not be shown. Every night I hear screams. And unlike you, Modred will not tire of her! Your fear offends me. - Fear only I may kill a lady. - A lady? You speak of the wrong woman! Do not force my hand. Says he who bows to me! He will kill Guinevere. God, forgive me. Do you mind? This is my castle to explore. As is your body, my queen. Not so brave now. My body is no more yours than the throne. Tell me. Where does a boy, who thinks so little of himself, find the nerve to claim the very honor that scares him so. To steal the role of a man who puts terror in his heart. Child, your father is coming and when he does and you're down on your knees begging him for Mercy, you'll wonder why you, a pathetic little rat, ever decided to take so much, and leave you little for the Camelot you betrayed! Tell me, are all Arthur's men so fragile? Who do you speak of? No one, my Queen. You can't be real. Fear not the truth, my lord. Come closer to me. You look so cold, my love. Tis I, Lancelot. And I would not harm you. Come. To Camelot. My lords. Welcome home. No sign of Arthur. Or Lancelot. Must have beaten them here. I didn't think you'd come so easily. Vortigone enjoyed your taste. Or should I say, the one that got away. Camelot thinks you're strong, Sir Lancelot. But we both know the honor that drives your sword. I could not have asked for a finer wedding gift. Tell me, how is my father? He cares nothing for you. You don't think I know that? You don't I've always known that? The whore is mine. Did you build all of this? - Was it a surprise for me? - No! Arthur! Father! Father! Father! Merlin! Merlin! Tell me you are real! I cannot go on alone! I have failed my queen! My country! I killed a girl. A warrior whose father gave his life for our land. You did what you had to do. Look upon me. I am no king! I talk but do you listen? A king does not mourn his own betrayal. He does not fight so others can rest. He does not survive because he fears death. He endures so that he can protect his people. His country. But most of all, he endures so he can empower those who cannot. Who dream of sitting at the Round Table beside the man they spend every minute of every day aspiring to be. So that they, one day, can be every inch that man. You their king. I know what troubles you, Arthur. What haunts your sleep. She's gone, Merlin. She's gone. Only if you believe it so. I did enjoy playing with the rat's emotions. All locked up. Bedraggled. I wonder if news of our imminent wedlock will draw my father more hastily? Killing his bastard son will be drive enough. You should try that on. I'd sooner wear rags. You will play nicely or you will watch as I dismember him. I've brought the wedding forward a little. Your ladies will be attending presently. Make sure you're bathed and rested. You shan't be getting any sleep tonight. Arthur. Come here. Merlin! Merlin! Is it true? Aye, my lady. He Keeps him in a cell below the ground. You'll have to hurry the guards will be back soon. Keep the doors locked, tell any visitors I bathe. My lady, it is too dangerous. Am I not your queen? - My lady. - Shh. Be quiet, my lord. No, Lancelot. How I've missed your touch, my dear lady. I'm no one's lady. Tell me you don't feel the same. What about Arthur? The Saxons near as the wedding approaches. You mustn't allow it. Say no, sweet Guinevere. It's not my choice to make. I must go. I shall find a way. Have faith. Uh. This is useless. How are we meant to beat the Saxons with these court jesters swinging their tiny cocks about? I fear they will eat us alive. Did your mothers never warn you about playing in the rain? Ready for blood, my lords? My lord, the Saxon nobles have set sail. Then stock up the wine. Let us ready for a wedding. And what of your bride? The scriptures say once made King he can re-marry. Then after the wedding I have no more use for her. Perhaps you could get rid of her for me. Another petty favor, my lord. It is worth all the favors in the world to become my queen. Make her suffer. I must admit, Vortigone, I did not think you would stoop so low. No, I've stooped much lower, my lady. Ask your husband. A lucky escape, I think he called it. Shame the same can't be said for yourself. You have no idea what is coming. Do you think I dote on Modred or consider his heart? He has the same weak blood as his father. The Saxons will eat him alive. Finally with me as Queen, Camelot will be the envy of all Britain. And yet, no one will love you. Hurry along. Your fianc√© waits. My Lord, it is not too late. To banish yourself, I wonder. You do not have to go through with this. You are a prince. One day, perhaps, Camelot will be yours by right. Correct me if I'm wrong, brother, but you took the purse I offered you? I only offer council, my lord. That's the problem with your sort. You think you're better. What do you call it, "enlightened"? But you're not. You're just like me. So, take your purse and keep your counsel. Well? She's on her way, my lord. Then let us not keep our wedding guests waiting any longer. Bring in the meat. Bow, my lords. I passed through a village. All the talk was of a great feast tonight. We target the Great Hall, that's where he'll be. There is a cave. Not a half a mile from here that leads us directly to a tunnel. A storm drain takes us into the heart of Camelot. Now we take no prisoners. We show no mercy. Anyone who tries to defend Modred, let them choke on their own blood. And if we fail? Failure is not an option. We cannot let the Saxons rule with an iron fist over the people who make Camelot what it is. My lords, I have not been the leader I aspire to be. King is a crown I've not always borne with ease. But I could choose no men with whom I'd rather share a fight today. The honor is mine. Our world is changing. Some are bringers of change. Others have change thrust upon them. But we must all adapt to it. We must all embrace it. And today I ask you, I urge you, to embrace a change for the good. Applaud your queen. When we get through, head straight to your positions. Leave Modred to me. Douse the torches. Kneel with her, my lord. I knew you'd see sense one day, my lady. One day you'll be on your knees begging for mercy, my lord. Arthur! What was that? - Arthur! - Lancelot. The cells, move! We are gathered here today in the presence of our Lord God. If you're not with me, you're against me. You fool. My lord. The knights. Guinevere. Are they safe? Only if we act fast, brother. And today is truly special. For today we are to witness not just a union, but a coronation. Let us proceed. These were men of Camelot. Our brothers! No. They were men of Modred. Do you, Lord Modred of Caerleon, take this woman to be your wife? I do. Now, Tristram. And do you, Guinevere daughter of Cwyrwd, take this man to be your husband? My lady? Say the words. Lucan! Here's to the heart of the church, brother. Get her out of here! He can't have her! Your whore cares not for you! You're not her king! Lancelot is. Liar! I thought you were going to save me. It's not safe here. What about Arthur? We have to go. Come. Guinevere! Father! Father! Out of my way, you stupid wench! You wanted to kill me? You wanted to take my crown? Let's see what kind of king you really are. Take my crown. Take it. Take... my... crown! Please, please, father. Have mercy on your son. Never, ever utter that name again. I am your king, you hear me? Your king and nothing more. Now leave. Leave Camelot. Tell your Saxon friends what they can expect if they come here. And if I ever see you again... Hail! Hail King Arthur! Hail Camelot! Hail! Hail King Arthur! Hail Camelot! My lords... Raise. Raise up your brothers. We will give them the honor they deserve. Hang the rest. Hang them from Camelot's walls. Let the crows gorge on them and the Saxons away. I will not fight another way today. You honor me, my lords. You honor yourselves. I am your king. But this is our Kingdom. This is your Camelot. Hail! Hail! Hail, King Arthur! Hail! Hail! Hail, King Arthur! Hail! Hail! Hail, King Arthur! Hail! Hail! Hail, King Arthur! Hail! Hail! Hail, King Arthur! Hail! Hail!
