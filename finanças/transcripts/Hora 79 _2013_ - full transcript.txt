So what are we talking about? Hora 79. Hora 79? -Yes. Hora 79, the best! Shlomo, I wish that were possible, but the group split up 30 years ago. Do you even know where Dori is these days? Dori... has disappeared. Well, shall we give it a shot? Hold on! Stop the music! Mind your shoulders. keep your shoulders down and your neck long! You're playing stalks, not corn! Okay? Take it from the top. - Excuse me? Come here. Come. Erez, did I ask you to stop the music? Listen, this is the second time you've ruined this shot, yes? This is cinema, and in cinema the one who calls the shots in called the director, which in this case is me, understood? - Cut the crap! Hagit... Hagit, get this old idiot outa here, I can't work Iike this! What's his name? - Nehemya. Are you the manager? -I'm the supervisor, from "Goldings"... I said to turn cell phones off! Ara'le, what's up? Erez, lose the background, let me see it clean. Hi, girls. Hi! Okay, camera. First position! We'll shoot another take. Hi there. How're things? - Great! Truth is, if it weren't for their fuddy-duddy instructor, we'd be almost done. - Eitan? I don't believe it! Eitan? Hora 79. Hemmy! My goodness! I haven't seen this "fuddy-duddy" in 30 years! -You don't say! Even longer! Not since the disaster in Denver, Colorado. And what's your role here? I'm the fuddy-duddy from "Goldings PR", the one they can't get rid of, because I own 33.3% of the company. So you became a choreographer? In Ganey Tikva. Gotta make a Iiving. Tell me, what does "Stalks in the Fields" have to do with deodorant? It's a commercial. Don't look for logic. Wow, Hemmy, seeing you here is such a coincidence! Speaking of coincidences, I just got a call from the karmiel festival. They're doing a tribute night for Dori and the group. Where do I find him and the gang? I have an idea for you: Bracha Yitzhaki. Ladies and gentlemen, here with us tonight is the veteran choreographer Nehemya Fishler! This is fantastic, Hemmy! A Hora 79 reunion in karmiel? Relax, Braha. They're just looking to find Dori. I hope they find that creep at the morgue! Wait, so they don't intend for us to have a Hora 79 reunion? - Listen to this: They want us to perform the Rishonim medley. Do you get it? Dancing! - Dancing? But don't worry, I talked them out of it. -You what?! Braha, it's unrealistic. - I'll kiIl you, Hemmy! Braha, it's not practical! - It is so, we can do it! "Yes, we can!" Yes? Who is this? Braha? Which Braha? Braha? Braha?! I can't believe it! Of course I'm coming. Where in Givatayim? "Alon High School"? I said no, and that's it! How'd you get my number? Is Dori in on it? Because if that scum is in, then I'm not. Look, expecting us to dance isn't realistic, but... Braha... Braha, tone it down! Okay, okay, it's realistic. Tami told me already, yes. My dear Braha, in my business there's no night and day. Especially if I have to call America, the West Coast. At "Ichilov" hospital. God forbid! I'm as healthy as an ox, I collect donations from abroad so I came to give them a check. - Michael! Michael? Are you on vacation? - I gotta go, the CEO wants to see me. Go give the Bulgarian from room 6 a shower. Okay, bye. What? Sharona, what's up? I was invited to the group's reunion. Hora 79. - After 30 years! WiIl you go? Is that a problem? - Of course not. I just don't want you to get hurt, because... I'm not the kid I was back then. Look what you've done! - How could you drive Iike that? Who gave you a Iicense?! - You smashed the headlight! Look at my headlight! - How could he do that?! He sees us trying to park. - ltzik? 30 years, ltzik! Yossi! - 30 years, ltzik! lt's just a car, but why take our spot so rudely? Why behave this way? Hi, guys. - Hi, Ruthie! Yossi! - How are you, Ruthie, dear? lt's great to see you guys! - Gee, you haven't changed a bit! Menny! Hey, guys. What's up? Hello, hello! ls that me? l can't believe it. "Oh, what a reunion... "lt happens only in pairs..." - Maya, don't start. "How are you? How's it going? Haven't seen you in a while."-Stop! Enough, Maya! No more Alterman songs, please! lt's by Haim Hefer. - Enough, l don't wanna hear it! Be available. - Don't wanna hear it! The "shvester" sisters are at it again. Look what l found in the attic! - lt fits you perfectly! Naomi! - Menny! What a hunk! - Say, what are you doing later on? Shall we do some horizontal dancing? - You're such a flirt! Hey, Rafi! Give us a hug. How've you been? Rafael, l gotta go. - Hold on. Braha, kudos on this great reunion! We should meet sometime - What do you mean, sometime? We're starting rehearsals! - Don't go over board. l'm not! Guys, come on, in two weeks we're performing in karmiel! Benny is in America and so is Drora. Talia is either in Australia or New Zealand. What about David? -He died of cancer. - You're kidding! l saw him on the train a year ago, he looked just fine! Are you sure, Maya? Hi! What's up? - David? So it's for real. l thought you were pulling my leg. Braha, why did l have to hear about this from ltzik? David, l couldn't find your phone number. Oh, l see Maya is here too. Hello, l'm happy you came. - Meet Natalya. Nice to meet you. - Hello, Natalya. Where's everyone? - Go straight and turn left. Okay, we're going in. Are you nuts? - Yeah, right! lt said in the paper: "David Ben Moshe suffered terrible illness". Doesn't "terrible illness" mean cancer? Be quiet one second! Come, Braha, let's watch the film. - Wait, it's important, it's about next week's plans... Word of advice: Don't invest in movies. The $500,000 l invested were shot to hell. Sorry about the quality, but it's an 8mm film. Where was this taken? When was it taken? - During our tour. Oh, it's in Scotland! Braha! -ls that me? - Yes. Was that taken in Dijon? - Yes, it was. You recognized right away! Sharona. lt's Sharona and Eitan. Do you plead guilty? Danny, make me a copy of this, please. -Okay. Guys, we have two weeks to work on the Rishonim medley in karmiel. Dori is gone. Does anyone miss him? l do very much, if you must know. l'm very sad he's not with us, He was a genius! He was the devil! -The arch-devil! - He screwed Avshi over, extorted him and screwed Janet as well. Cut it out, guys! - And he killed them both. Come on, Liora. - Butt out of this. -Enough! Can we quit talking about it? lt was an accident. - Yeah, right... Liora, you're going too far! - Ruthie, you didn't know the real Dori, you joined the group later on and became his new toy. "She walked in his room a virgin "and left a virgin no more". What's that? - Shakespeare. Guys, this argument is irrelevant. Right now someone has to take charge. We all remember the medley, there's no need for managers. Besides, Braha, l'm not sure you're right for the job. l think the best man for the job is Hemmy. Hemmy was Dori's assistant, and among all of us, he was the only one who kept on folk-dancing. l gotta tell you, the idea of us performing on stage, before an audience, is... Look at us! l told Braha it's ridiculous! So we've elected Hemmy. - What?! -Yes! Guys, hold on, don't l have a say on this? Come on... Left and... balance. Hold! Hold! Hey! ltzik? 1, 2, bend down, back up, and down again. ltzik, tempo! And... 2. ls my tempo off? Tempo... go on. 1, 2... You're all rusty! Gather in the corner, everyone. What is it? We're doing "Blue kerchief". - Gil, accordions are out, this isn't the 70's, today it's all on computers. She doesn't intend on dancing with us, right? -Yes, actually. She's a top-dancer! - So what? But she wasn't in our group. She's a great dancer, better than some that l know and she'll get the steps in no time. lt's not a problem for her. But it's a problem for us, because we're redoing our show as group, and back when this group split, your girlfriend wasn't yet living in lsrael. She was still a child in Russia. - ls that it? That she's Russian, and younger than you? Everyone here is younger than you! You were always rude and you stayed rude! Wait, l have a suggestion. Natalya will rehearse with us and if someone can't dance she'll be her replacement. - Great idea. lt'll be good for you too. Okay, guys, gather in pairs. Let's go. Sharona, come here... Switch to Gili. Liora, you stand here. And 1, 2, turn and 1... Up! 1, 2, 3, 4, up and 1... Hello, everyone. Nahum? Your memory isn't what it used to be! Ay, Nehemya? So now you're...? Nice, nice upgrade! Well done. l heard you have a children's group in Ganey Tikva. -Yep. -Nice! Where's Dori? - ln hell! lt's a shame l had to learn about Hora 79's comeback through the karmiel festival's office. l thought you'd call me, but... Never mind. Listen, l have an offer for you guys. Nahum, you left the group. - No, you guys kicked me out! lt was Dori who kicked you out. - Get real, Dori begged me to stay, l was his best dancer! Although l couldn't stand his lame choreography. You said you had an offer, what is it? l have a dance group in Jerusalem; You've heard of "Admati", right? No... - Here's my offer: Let's ditch the Rishonim medley and do something new with a "soil" theme. Something young, fresh, energetic, Jewish, masculine, real! With your choreography? - Yes. You don't want to bring back the past, but that's how it should be, redoing the past. lt's a tribute night to the old group! lf we knew it was new material, we wouldn't show up. Especially if the theme was... Dirt? Was that it? Soil. Soil theme. - Nahum, you misunderstood. We've gathered here because of what happened back then. l don't want anything to do with your stinking past. Call me if you change your mind. - Okay. The choreographer... "Soil"! More like "mud"... Okay, let's move on to " Cyclamen". Twist to the right. Nehemya, it used to be to the left. Right or left? - Guys, guys, The festival in Dijon. Yaki fell off the stage during this number. -Right. And he fell to the right. - He fell to the left. Yaki, what side was it? -What? - When you fell off the stage in Dijon, what side did you fall? - l never fell off the stage in Dijon! There's footage of the show, we can watch it in slow-mo like in basketball. Guys, what's the difference? Let our choreographer decide. Nehemya? - Twist to the right! Danny, could you take the camera and film now? You're taking my partner away so he can film us?! lt's so that we know what to do next rehearsal. 3 and... 1, 2, 3, 4. Turn, partner, and slalom. 1, 2... Form a waltz circle. 1, 2, 3... Back, 5, 6, skip... Right, up, left... Right... Go on. Dasi, everything okay? Menahem can give you a check up. lt's okay. l don't want to take chances. Menahem! lt's not me, it's Yaki. He had a heart problem two months ago. So? -lf l tell him to rest, he won't do it, just to spite me, but if l take a break, he has no choice. ls something wrong? Am l missing the beat? Tempo! And... Hey! ltzik? Turn and... Sharona, you need a GPS! lt'll take me a few seconds. Look, Nehemya, l didn't want to make an issue, but Sharona was my partner, so... Why is that important? - Yes. lf we're redoing the dance from 30 years ago, it should be accurate. Eitan, it's not final, okay? - So why did you switch her? What? lf you really wanna know, she asked me to. She insisted that you two don't dance together. l have no backbone. l promised myself l wouldn't be hostile, that l won't show anger, and that l'd be pleasantly aloof, and instead, l'm a bitch from hell! Sweetie, you have every reason to be. When Braha called me, l thought: Perhaps he changed, gained weight, gotten all wrinkly and bald... - l hate to tell you, but he looks better than ever. When he smiles at me, l tell you... He does it for me. - Eitan's smile. lt's so obvious! He always does that to get something, that bastard! 1, 2, 3, 4... Hey, ltzik! This whole idea is stupid! Everyone remembers us as a group, the "it-group", and we're just going to make a mockery of ourselves. l don't want to say l told you so, but l told you so. Why the long faces? We did better than expected for a first time. Even Hemmy thinks so. Right, Hemmy? Guys, l have a suggestion: We have to start a healthy food regimen. To lose the toxins in our bodies. No meat or dairy. Yeah, right. And l suggest that we, at lease the guys from Tel Aviv, meet at the beach three times a week for a 30-minute swim to get back in shape. Who's the idiot who suggested 6 a.m? -You. Rafi, we need to toughen up. But why at 6 a.m? - Look, there's Sharona! Sharona, didn't we say guys only? - Guys, going for a swim? Look, you must start off with a warm-up sprint. -Let's do it. Sharona, we have to talk. What...? Where's everybody? Hey, come here! - Eitan, come here! Food! Hey, guys. -What are you doing? You're poisoning yourselves! Everything is poison! Come on! - Okay. Sit down. Here's some lettuce for you. Sit down. - That's it? You're giving up on swimming? - l have to be at work at 8. You couch potatoes! Sit down. We have to do it gradually. Tomorrow we start swimming, no more excuses. Someone better bring some coffee, or l can't function. Did you hear? Nehemya is thinking of moving her to the third row. Who, Ronit? - No, Braha. Can't be! No way! - But she made a big stink about it. So who's moving to the first row? Who do you think? - Ronit. -Ronit? Hey there - Hi What's up? Hey, ltzik Do you recognize him? He donesn't remember Hi, guys -Sorry - What? -What's your name again? Come on, Tammy, l'm Josef! Dori used to call me Yoski, a mesh between Yossi and Yoske - l don't remember You guys don't remember? l danced in the group for two months till l broke my leg in reserves duty Naomi, don't you remember how l wooed you? You had a boyfriend who was a career soldier Okay, guys, let's begin - Hey, Nehemya! -Hello Come forward, please l can't believe it, what's with you people?! l was with you at the festival in Dijon! Remember they caught Mickey trying to shoplift some Camembert cheese? Or when Dasi didn't come to the show at "Gran Pallette" and we went looking for her and found her screwing that Norwegian guy, and had to make sure that her boyfriend Yaki doesn't know about it? Where's Dasi? ls she here? - Come here Come, come You're leaving now What? -Leave! - But Wait, let him stay, we're short on guys, so Danny, the film from the festivals that you screened could you screen the part taken in Dijon again? -Why? This damn computer! Gil, come here a second 3, 4 1, 2 And go! You joining in? Tighter Turn "And we suddenly meet " Waltz! Moving on to "Cyclamen" Guys, join them! Waltz! What did you want to ask me? Rafi, l wanted to ask you something But don't be offended Are you Gay? Everybody knows l offended you - Not at all, everybody knows Even my bank manager, it's okay Why do you ask? lt's my son, Roi He's also l think ls that a problem for you? - Don't mention it to anyone, okay? Yes, it's a problem for me l hope you don't make him feel rejected or anything -No We're very close But What? Can it be cured? Where did he get it? Look, Haya says it's My wife Haya says it's genetic Perhaps she's sticking it in to me for screwing around on her, but Someone else told me the same thing, so if it's genetic, it must be from her side - And it's from your side? lt couldn't be Look, l l've tried to picture myself with another man And? What a lock of hair! This photo has been in my wallet for 30 years, look how grungy it looks! l took it out two years ago because of my partner Amikam - Yes, l saw you two when we met He made such a scene! - Over the photo? -He's jealous What, did he think? And he was right Brace yourself for this one You were the love of my life Can't be! You were Excuse me You had that little Hungarian girlfriend, what was her name? l'd tremble when you came near me l'd think about you during the day and dream about you at night The Hungarian girl said you two were getting married The worst thing was, l couldn't say anything l was in the closet, nobody knew Except for Dori, that bastard sensed it He knew it, and he took advantage of it But he was with Ruthie - With Ruthie and Tammy and Liora and all the girls -Liora too? And Avshi and me and Janet - You're kidding! Why do you think Avshi and Janet were killed? That bastard! You were so occupied with you naive affairs, you didn't see it Everyone say, noticed or felt something How would you feel if l told you l loved you? When? Back then? This coming weekend we have full-day rehearsals at Ha'kfar Ha'yarok lt's not very expensive and we'll have great facilities We get there by cars and with no spouses, of course Well, Yaki and Dasi, you'll get a discount, of course Everyone's coming, so be one time! lt's next week, don't forget! On time! Oh, man! Asher Arbel didn't come, and that worries me Does anyone know what's going on with him? What's with you, Braha? Haven't you read in the papers or heard on the news? Asher was arrested He took money from people and his empire crumbled l can't believe it, l'm devastated He promised me he'd pay for the outfits l saw it coming two months ago, so l sold all his stocks l thought maybe you would No problem, it'll be okay Eitan, l've been holding it in since the first reunion, but do you remember you owe me a pair of earrings? Excuse me?! - Hayelet Ha'shahar l spoke with a heavy Polish accent and you guys would laugh when l said Hayelet Ha'shahar - But why earrings? We had a show at Ayelet Ha'shahar, the group got there by bus but there was no room for us so we rode in Avshi's truck, on the pile of outfits in the back By the time we'd passed Afula we were both naked l wanted you badly, and so did you ln the heat of the moment, you swallowed my earring and promised to get me a new pair Yes, l remember No problem What did they look like? l wasn't being serious - But a promise is a promise Excuse me, l'm in a rush He has many girlfriends, but enough about me, what's new with you? l'll tell you l have to talk to you Can l come in? Excuse me, l'm in a rush - Where are you girls rushing to? Why did you ask Nehemya to split between us? Come on, Eitan, l'm in a rush! - What? What's with her? - How should l know? Perhaps it's because 30 years ago you knocked her up and disappeared? l missed you You think l didn't notice you were following me? Drive Did the 39 bus pass by? Sorry if l scared you Sweetie, after all l've been through in life, you can't scare me What do you mean? You really expect me to tell you? - Why not? Because where l served, lay lsrael's darkest secrets - l thought you were in finances Nowadays, Eva! l gave 20 years of my life to defending this country, now l'm doing it for myself What do you do? l mean, what about your Mercedes? Jaguar, Eva! Jaguar! l don't drive German cars Jaguar! - What about your Jaguar? Why are you questioning me?! What's with you? You keep meddling and meddling knock it off already! You're so Polish! Maybe l went too far Taxi! l hate to ruin your soap-opera, Eitan, but my Liron is 27 years old and you're not her father But Roni told me - l had an abortion l just don't understand, and l'm not asking out of insult or anger, One moment we were deeply in love and the next moment you vanished You could've told me that it's over, that the love is gone lt would've killed me but l'd at least understand l don't know, l guess l panicked You know, marriage, a family And so l bought a ticket to California Many times since then, especially since the reunion, l imagine what it would be like if we arrived at the airport together Well, l just want to say that l'm sorry if l seemed angry at you l'm not angry l even kinda like you But l don't intend on asking myself "what if" l have a calm life, a lovely daughter and a man who loves me A man who loves you and you love him Take me home David, why am l even here? They don't want me to dance Don't worry, trust me lt'll be okay Just tell me and l'll switch with Eitan You're out of your mind - No, l'm not You wanna share a room with Manahem? Hey there! -Hey! - What's up? l'm fine, good morning - Where are the rooms? That way -Over there? - Hello! What's going on? - l heard you had heart problems Come on, it's nothing! There's a special diet here that could really help you What's with him? This side, you're together in room 6 - Thanks Hey there! Say, did Menahem show up? - He's coming with Eitan They're in room 3 You and Danny? Room 11 at the end of the hall Miriam has the room for herself l doubt it'll do her any good Tammy, don't you have a life? lt's a shame that Naomi who's interested in Menny is stuck in a room with Ruthie Does anyone know where Mickey is? He hasn't shown up They move us from place to place! - Lady, l just washed here! Well, you shouldn't wash floors in the middle of the day! People are walking here, they can break their neck! Wait - l'm not waiting l've had it with this hospital! lt's just as cruddy as our country! Come on, Mom -Didn't you dance with the Haifa student group? -Excuse me?! You're Hannah B, right? My memory is like new! - No, Hanna B is my sister l'm Sara B Where have we met? - Hora 79 -Oh, those guys You really look alike You're the older sister No, she is! 4 year difference Anyway, they sent us running around, my mom's been on her feet for hours! Now they sent me there! Can you help me with this? lt's the wrong way The person who wrote these directions is at fault, not you lt's over there, l'll take you - Come on, Mom Be careful Eva, come look That's the film from Dijon, right? - Of course Who's the one dancing with Drora? Guys, please don't touch my computer Nobody's forcing you! lsn't that the guy who was here? Yossi? Yoske? Guys, let's get back, we have a lot of work ahead -Let's go Let's begin with rehearsal - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen Finally you're here, Mickey - lt takes time to get the outfits Micky, you're the best! You're amazing! Wow! When will they arrive? -They promised by tomorrow -Like hell they will Two more times! Now! 1, 2, 1, 2, walk, 4 and 1, 2, leg, 4, and 1, 2, skip and to the side! 1, 2, and up! Turn, turn Back scissor kick Hey! Okay, take a 10 minute break - Yes! Thank you very much Yaki, you promised not to smoke - Dasi, l'm not stupid! What do you want from her? She's worried about you Yes, but it's stupid Everyone smiles at their dancing partner, and she looks at me like she expects me to croak any minute lf l were a couples' counselor, l'd tell you to ask Hemi to change partners for you lt won't work out l know it sounds dumb, but l can only dance with her Even if she does have a thing for Norwegians Great, it's locked Braha, l hope you have a key What's the problem, gentlemen? The wonder key will save us What about Mickey? You think he arranged the outfits? Otherwise, he's out Mickey, you're a real criminal During rehearsal, l'll decide on partners and placements lt's about time! But You know there'll be a problem The tall girls can't be at the front She also gets the dances wrong You always get it wrong! Well, you can't have everyone in the front row, guys! You wanna do the placements instead? How could do this to me? - Do what? l can't believe you moved me to the second row Braha, let's not mix the two: The fact that you put your time and effort to organize this, doesn't give you any breaks regarding the dance! - What are you yapping about? l'm talking about the dance itself l might not be the best dancer in the group, but l'm in the top three, far better than Yael, whom you've placed in front of me though she forgets the steps and it drives me nuts! l look at you dancing, and you seem like you're out of breath, okay? Like a punctured tire, okay? - That's only during rehearsal You know that l fly when l'm on stage Then fly during rehearsal! Because what you give there is what the audience sees on stage Okay? l'm going to eat Don't think l don't know the reason This is so petty What's the reason? - Don't play coy! Come on, Braha, that was 30 year ago -33! You know how many girls didn't give me any during these 33 years? Bastard Braha, let's give it a shot l'll put you back in the first row if you give it your all 100%, even during rehearsal Hemmy, of course! Of course l will! l'm going to shower See you at the dining room l'm at Ha'kfar Ha'yarok, not in the boondocks! Haya, you don't need to come here, damn it! Why don't you do it in a room, on a bed? That's all l needed She would've slept over Wouldn't that be nice? They said no spouses, didn't they? Pass the cranberries - lt's not cranberries, it's kalapata My friend from Chile sent it to me You know what antioxidants are? - l'm telling you, you sit there in the boat for hours and it's it's the worst thing ever After the talk, you wanna meet at the hayloft? The hayloft? Why not the threshing floor? After the talk -No way - l'll wait for you Just so you know, l'm also a tour guide l once showed two tourists around Mea Shaarim You don't want to hear it, fine What are you doing here? - We said we'd meet, no? -You did l didn't think you'd be here, figured you'd give up and leave l didn't know whether to show up or not, so l did, but late, thinking you'd be gone - You almost succeeded Steinberg, what do you want from me? Me? You're the one driving me wild All these years, not always, but every now and then, l try to imagine what if we had stayed a couple "But now when l see you " - Shut up, you moron Those images haunt me lt's night time, l sit and write on the computer while you read a book You put the book down turn off the light and come up behind me You give me a barely noticeable kiss on the neck and leave quietly Oh, l read while you write What was the name of your masterpiece? -Don't laugh, l keep trying to write it, but l can't Everywhere l look, all l see is failure Failure? Eitan Steinberg, the golden boy? Almost 60 years old - But who owns 33 3% of "Goldings" And 100% failure Since seeing you again, that feeling just worsened l also feel l've had it with working Want to buy my share of "Goldings"? l'll give you a discount 33% - And a third Eitan, stop it -What? - You know You mean this? l mean this Sharona? What do you think? Girls, can you lend a hand here? Guys, the outfits! - The outfits! Take a "small", it's too long No marking the outfits! Let's use colorful threads to mark them lf it doesn't say the size, try it on! Seriously Does the belt go on the side? - Yes No, wait, l'll ask her Would you happen to have? Darling, this is all l've got! How do l look? Nothing special Are you angry? - Should l be? Don't push, l Could you be quiet? Sarah B -On the side lt will be flattering l almost forgot Your Mickey sure is stylish - Sarah B, how do you know Mickey? Tammy! -lt's okay l ran into him at "lchilov" hospital He helped me with a problem, we started talking and he said you guys had an outfit crisis but he's broke, so "Costume Warehouse", that's me - Wait, what? What do you mean, he's broke? - You heard me He's penniless, which is why he washes hospital floors He was putting on an act He's the one paying for our outfit rental -Oh ls that what he's telling you? - Yes, he raises money for "lchilov", he must've been volunteering that day He was not volunteering, are you for real? He's doing community service at the hospital lt wasn't a big crime, just a little felony No way Even if that's so, do 15,000 shekels count for nothing? 15,000 shekels? How'd you come up with that? He gave you a check, didn't he? - A check? The one you just got - Oh, right, the check The check Read it out loud "Thank you for your generosity "To me, you're not Sarah B, but rather Sarah A1!

Shlomo quit last week and so Ara'le hired me at the last moment Glad to see you guys Come, have a seat Okay, look ln the Rishonim medley you do a Debka dance, question is, can you not do the Debka? - Not do the debka?! They medley is short as it is You see, thing is, Veiser talked with me and he noted that the Debka isn't a Hebrew dance, and so he asks that there be no Debkas in the program But what about the Hora? - What about it? The Hora isn't a Hebrew dance either, it's Romanian, from the Balkans We'll see - Don't give me that! We were told to dance our old dances, and we'll do just that! lt won't be "just that"! You know that, Braha! How old are we? Some of us are in our 60's - And we dance the same! l'm trying to save you the embarrassment! l have an idea: l have a slot called "over 30's", for veteran groups Some dance okay, you know them, Hemmy So why are you? - Forget it! -Braha l have the festival's itinerary right here lt says: "23:00 p m, tribute to Hora 79" There's a host and three young groups who've rehearsed Dori's choreography for this evening You're not cancelling this! - Did l say "cancel"? On the contrary, l'm even moving you two hours earlier You'll perform at 21:00 An ideal hour You know what this reminds me of? Los Angeles That amphitheater "The Hollywood Bowl" Amazing, it's all coming back to me Come on, what's going on? Get off the stage! We've got work to do Please get off -What does he want? -Thank you We're performing here tomorrow Not in the amphitheater, you'll be at "Frischberg" Nahum, they told us we'd be in the amphitheater "Frischberg" can't even fit 400 people The program says - We had to make changes l almost forgot: l've got great news for you! l just got an email saying that Dori Ben-Gal, the group's founder, will take part in the program He's arriving in karmiel this afternoon What?! -And he demands to take charge of the group No way! -No way! - We don't agree! Guys, we must decide: Do we accept or object? Obviously, we're objecting But what happens after that? What do you mean "we"? Why is it obvious what we do? l think we should give Dori a warm welcome Not after what he's done to you - You mean, to YOU! Look, guys, l don't like Dori, l hate him He's a piece of shit! But you've gotta admit it: Without Dori there'd be no group We started out as "Dora 79", remember? He was a genius! - You don't say! Don't forget he killed Avshi and Janet Come on "killed" lt was an accident and we're grieving them, that's all -Why do you say that? l was there, l saw Avshi ram the van into the semitrailer on purpose lt was no accident lt's still not murder Ever wonder why he did it? - So he was screwing Janet, he screwed half the girls in the group, and even some boys, now and then, no? Thanks a lot! The problem with you is that you have no empathy Picture Avshi, that sweet kid whom we all loved and knew, and how Dori made him into his slave in bad and in other ways We heard he also took money from him But the kid found love Why Janet of all people? Believe me, l don't know But he was in love and blossoming, and Dori was furious to see his slave slip away So the bastard seduced Janet and being the devil that he is he made sure that Avshi see the whole thing We figured as much - No, no No, we didn't, l know Janet told me l came home late at night to the motel we stayed in, l had some fling in town, and she met me in the lobby She was shivering and she told me: "He just took the outfit van "and completely lost his mind" Those were her words She begged that get into the outfit van to try and do something But l refused l was tired, all l wanted to do is sleep And it kills me to think that maybe l could've prevented this double suicide or murder l don't know what to call it You never told us that The passing years didn't make it easier lt's not easy even now When l go up to my room l still see and hear a van starting, and l rush to the window, and imagine him ram that truck and the ball of fire exploding You saw the rest from your own rooms So we've decided: lf he's in, we're out What are you scared of? lt's been more than 30 years We're not the kids anymore l'm not the only one who thinks sol, right, Ruthie? To me he was sweet l'm so happy with what l bought! What did you buy? lt's a three-story complex The 1st floor is cosmetics, the 2nd floor is children's clothing Hold this Where is she off to? Yoshke, wait! Excuse me - What do you want? l saw you, you really were in our group l saw you! l'm from Hora 79, we didn't recognize you at the rehearsal -So? So, Yoshke, l know you were with us! lt's Yoski, not Yoshke! - Right A mesh between Yossi and Yoske They screened our show and l saw you dancing there, with Drora - Yes You're Eva Now l remember Eva "Polska" - That's right lt's been years since l was called that Aren't you glad there's proof that you were with us? lt doesn't matter anymore l was thinking, what does it say about us if we forgot you? What does it say about me, if you forgot me? Listen, l have to change my shirt Noblesse oblige Where are you all sleeping? - At the school, the "Hilton" l'm here, at the "Sheraton" What happened? l lost my contact lens Let me try Men lose things, and women find them Well, if you say so oh! What? Noblesse oblige Where's everybody? - They went to dance And you? - l'm safeguarding Why are you sitting in the dark? - The fuse tripped Mickey, why aren't you dancing? - Menny, don't start up! -What? - Why don't l pay for hotel rooms? Relax, Mickey! l just wanted to ask - l've had it! People expect me to pick up the tab for everything! Did anyone ask you to?! -l see the expectation in their faces Here's a newsflash l don't mind them knowing: l'm penniless! - Relax, Mickey We all know - What? That you're broke and that you do community service at "lchilov" So why? - They didn't want to offend you l'm such an idiot! What's left for me to do here? - Mickey, Mickey, you did what we all wanted to do l'm such an idiot! - What do you think? l also wanted to say that l work at Weizmann lnstitute rather than at the HMO You Rafi wanted to end up a bank teller? How can l go on in this humiliation? You all pretended to believe me! - So pretend that you believe that they believe you You mean play along? Just play along Why are you sitting in the dark? We fixed the fuse How are you? Great! The stock market went up today Eitan, what's gonna be with us? Whatever happens, we'll be together Did you even think about the outcome? Well? -Sweetie, l don't know what's gonna be, l didn't plan it, l just know l can't let you go When l'm with you l feel whole, like l don't need anything else l think it's called "Happiness" Not many people get this great gift lt's amazing, a miracle Happiness lf only we could stay cuddled in this bed forever but then l hear the sound of a car outside and it reminds me there's a world out there Come, my darling, look at this Eitan, wait, l want to ask you something What a surprise! l missed you! Braha, when did the group change its name to Hora 79? - ln '79 Who's that moron? - Dr Gonen, our host Hello, Hora 79, l'm here! Hello, my dear! How's your heart? - l told them at the hospital: "l don't intend to miss that show!" Why aren't we at the amphitheater? Because of evil and stupidity When the hall is packed with no more seats, let's see them complain to us - l don't think it'll be packed Let's hope it'll be half or even a quarter full You should see what's going on outside -Nobody came? There's nobody in the hall? - They went to see the koreans Nahum, that bastard! He moved us up from 23:00 to 21:00 so we're back to back Look where they're going Mr Berman Hey, Roi You came to see your dad dancing? - l just came to say hi, my friends and l are going to see the koreans Come here Give me a hug Good luck!

Bummer Guys, Dori is in the audience! So what? Screw him! Where is he? - Who's that next to him? l bet he conned some African manager No, he wants to see if we can dance without him And you know what? We'll show him we can, until his eyes pop out! lf there's one thing that schmuck taught us, it's that not even tanks can stop us once we start dancing! Wait, guys Gili, come on, get dressed Ruthie, l see you're not dressed either Gil, let's roll - Okay Good evening, everybody Before we ask who Hora 79 was, we should first ask what lsraeli folk dancing is Let's go, guys, we're up - Guys, guys l know you all laugh at me, but Alterman wrote this song for us: "How wonderful are these nights "Where we can dance the Hora "Rise and shine, Hora, we won't stand back "Ascend with me, Hora, my Hora " Braha, are you okay? - l'll be right back Get dressed, you're up Put this on, quickly!
