Go and get the sweets. Get all of them. We are running out. You've applied too much turmeric on groom. He looks yellow. - Are you dead? - Where's the alcohol? Good, the horse is ready. Play the band. Give a trial run. You too. Good. You too, the rattle guy. Drums? Let's go for it! Let's go for it! 1, 2, 3! Move your hands faster! Hurry up! We are working on it! This spade's blade has gone blunt. You and your excuses. Give it to me. Fine, you do it. Here you go. [folk wedding songs] [folk wedding songs] [folk wedding songs] [folk wedding songs] - You go and dance, dear. - I am not going to dance. [folk wedding songs] [folk wedding songs] Release the water. Release it in full force. Yes, release it in full force. Okay. Release it in full force. There's a jeep coming this way. There's a jeep coming this way! Not one, but many. Mahendra? That's... Run! Run! Run! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop the jeep! There they are! There's one running along the river. Go after him, Pawan. Catch them! There they are! There they are! Where are you going, fatso?

How many seats did congress get? Leave this topic. Gone are the days when farmers would form a government. Merchants hold the reign nowadays. You are right. Just sit down and take from here! Standing on my head! Play this song. Neither wine, nor venue nor bargirl... I won't move from here unless you play it. What is he blabbering? Play it. - What are you doing? - When will we leave? We'll leave as soon as Mahendra shows up. Fauji, you didn't jump in the water? That's enough. You useless scum! Let me go. Please let me go. Ruldu, you? Who is he? Ruldu. Ruldu, who? You know Jagtap, the fat, dark guy? How are you related to him? I am his nephew. Whose turn is it to take the water, nephew? It's your turn. Then? I told him not to. Uncle said, "They'll all be busy attending headman's wedding." "You don't need to worry." I made a mistake. Please forgive me. Jagtap. What do we do with them? They are just kids, let them go. They are also our nephews. This is your uncle Kansa saying hello! Let's get going. We have a wedding to attend. Having fun, kiddo? Let me go, please. Greetings! Greetings, everyone! Come on, guys. Handle him. Greetings, brother. What? You got tired already? Come with me. Look at him dancing shamelessly! Yes. Greetings, brother. Greetings. Give me some change. No. You don't say no to this. But brother so much... You're looking nice. I hope you had milk, to keep your energy up. All okay? Greetings, everyone. Mahendra is here. - Welcome! - You are late! Is Jagtap inside? Yes, he is. Come with me, If you can't pour it here then pour some over here. Buzz off. Why should I? Jagtap. Got it? Did you get it? If you got it then it's all good. Continue. - You bastard... - No, no, Fauji. Go, have a drink. What's wrong, Mahendra? It's nothing. Serve him a drink and get me as glass as well. - Calm down. - What happened? Yes, brother? You didn't come? Where? Oh. Uncle Shamsher Singh's son was supposed to get married today. I forgot. You think I am stupid? I know your excuses. Mahendra... Hear me out, bro. Please hear me out, bro. You come here. - Come here and talk to me. - Tell me something, will you come for my wedding at least? Or you already have an excuse ready for that as well? I already have an excuse ready, brother. I see. Then make sure it's a solid one. Bye, you stupid boy. Hey... Where's Jugnu? I'll go get him, brother. No one has applied henna on my hands as yet. - Does anyone have any plans to do it? - Where is he running off to? So many things to do at a house where there's a wedding taking place. Jugnu! Open the door! Jugnu! Lambe, open the door! Welcome, Mr. Groom. Come, let's dance. "Come, my love." - "Come, my love." - What the hell is going on? Stop this Disco, Billu. Damn it. Where is Jugnu? Look over there. He puked, a lot. He just slept. Oh no. What do we do now? Mahendra is downstairs. He is asking for him. Jugnu... Jugnu... Is he dead? Look at his face. Come on, guys. Come here, Mr. Groom. Come on, brother. Join us, Billu. Come, come, come. So... Tonight's the night. What's tonight? What do you plan to do? I don't know, bro. Look bro, she is leaving her house for you. Right. For me. Yes, for you. She must be scared. Tell her. What should I tell her? That there is nothing to worry about! - Right. - Okay. Go to her and hold her hand. Okay. No, let go of the hand. Let go of the hand. Let go of the hand. I am not holding it. Billu, let go of my hand. He got married to her. You should let him hold her hand. No Billu, you only talk on the first night. Recite a couplet for her. This one... Don't think about the house. Don't think about the outsiders. Don't think about the dowry car. You don't have to wash any clothes or utensils. For how long will you keep doing it? They keep piling up every day. You don't need to look after my parents either. You just need to make me a happy man! [Folk songs] [This is Haryana] No class? No, dumbass. Don't bother having a bath. - There is no class. - Jaibeer? Our class has been cancelled. Girls from the Home Science section have a class in our room instead. Girls will sit on our benches. Ouch. Careful, bro. Hey... Want a beer, bro? Okay. You are late. What's wrong? I couldn't find a rickshaw. Your class is taking place in our classroom today. I will sit in your place. How do you know where I sit? How can I not know? Last bench on the left hand side. Hmm? Hmm. I see you every day. Why? Because I like to. What do you like? To look at you. Then look at me. Jaibeer... Yes, Vasudha? Jaibeer... Tell me. Including the fields next to the canal the total comes to... Is that all of them? Yes, that's all of them. Tired? Have a puff. Write it or I'll forget. Note it down. - What will happen? - Listen to me. For the shop at the market it's 13,25,000... You...! - Catch him! - Brother! You are like a wild ox! He was sloshed yesterday as well. And at the wedding, he didn't even realise when the guests left. Brother! Bloody drunkard. The joy of the high makes me forget everything, brother. I don't realise when to stop. Shameless fellow. The joy of the high makes me forget! I'll kill your joy! Mahendra! You look like Dharmendra today. It's nothing. I wore them because Rajendra had brought them from Delhi. Good. You should wear them, you look nice in them. Right, Japan Singh? - Pawan! - Yes, uncle? Did you call the market? Uncle, I... There is no need, uncle. I'll talk to them. We get to decide the rate this time. Or else the grain stays with us. We will distribute them to the poor. Call that dog. I am on it. Can I talk to dog? No, doggie. Mahendra, aren't you tired? You keep working all day long. You got the boys younger to you married. You have been delaying getting married for 10 years now. You are not getting any younger, son. It's already too late. I saw a white hair in his moustache. I'll... We are going to see the girl tomorrow. Mahendra, get married. I'll dance at your wedding like this. He will dance like this, huh? Look at my boys. They keep watching movies all day. There is no new movie playing, brother. Since many days. They have someone in Mumbai, who keeps sending them new movies. Look at that one, their leader, leaving slyly. Always fiddling with his phone. You still haven't ordered the big screen from Delhi. How am I supposed to create a cinematic atmosphere at home? Get this straight, you will have to pay up. You are done. What? Leave! Don't ring the bell. Phone's ringing. Who is it? Whoever it is, call later. Disconnect the call. I am being charged for this call, I won't disconnect it. Listen up you idiot, I'll get inside the phone and strangle you. Right, strangle me. Come on, strangle me. Hey, hey, hey! My phone! Look at him. Always cracking jokes. Hello, Jay? Jay? Jay, it's Jugnu. How are you, bro? Good? I had asked for some movies. Oh, you gave them to uncle Amar Singh? Okay. You have also included some songs? Thank you, brother. Did you get the money? Does this lot include the heroine Alia's movies as well? Okay, brother. Thank you. Uncle Amar Singh still hasn't showed up with my movies. "You are my life." "You are the one who makes me happy." "I felt alive when I saw you." "I want to see you to my heart's content." "But my heart's never satisfied." "I'll die with happiness if you'll turn around and look at me." "I came alive." "I swear on God, I came alive." "Oh God, I came alive." "I feel intoxicated," "But I never consumed any alcohol." "I came alive," "I swear on God." "Colours now look more colourful." "Even butterflies seek you," "As you make this atmosphere better." "You are my light," "I burn for you." "Even the flowers agree," "You are the one who makes them fragrant." "I came alive." "I swear on God, I came alive." "Oh God, I came alive." We were four brothers. Mahendra's father was the second eldest. Mahendra's parents passed away in a road accident 15 years ago. I am the third son. And my younger brother Shishpal is the youngest of us all. - Have a puff. - That's Fauji. He's a soldier. He can break a wall with his forehead. It was made with sand. A wall is a wall even if it's made with sand. He has a very thick moustache. Bimla? He has a very thick moustache. Go away! Let's go. Cover your face, dear. Bimla, he is a very nice boy. Don't discuss intellectual stuff, okay? You'll turn 30 this year. I am already 30. Shut up. - You aren't 30 yet. - Stop hogging. They are delicious. Do you want to eat all of them? You know how angry your father gets if there's a refusal, Bimla. Greetings, sister-in-law. - Welcome. - Aunty. I am Rohtas, sister-in-law. Your brother-in-law. Don't already start forming relationships. From your lips to God's ears, son. - Have a seat, son. - Okay. - Let's go. - Let's go. These Samosas are delicious. Did you make them at home? No, son, we are not confectioners. He's my uncle's son, Rohtas. Well... Come on, give me a kiss. You always keep kissing me. Stay away from me, I'm telling you. Get down, Jugnu. Get down, I say. When are we going home, brother? Are you angry? You didn't like the girl? Get him down, Andy. Get down. - Get him down. - Get down. No. Stay away from me. That's Jugnu, my younger brother. I have another brother who is studying at Hisar University. Jugnu loves to watch movies. Do you watch movies? Not many. It's not allowed at home. What about you? Hello? Yes. Yes, I'll do it. I had just given them some donation. Listen, tell them, we'll personally give gifts to kids this time. Make sure you don't misbehave with them. Hang up. I'll call you later. So, movies... No, I am always so busy with work... My life is like a movie for me. I heard that you are very beautiful. I think you don't want us to get married. Do you have anyone else in your life? Is there anyone else? No, no one. I'll only get to spend five minutes with you. And my family will ask me for my decision. In five minutes, What do I tell them? I don't know anything about you. How well educated are you? Have you ever been with a girl-- I flunked in high school. This is the first time I am talking to a girl like this. Would you believe me? You are not hesitant. Are you lying? I am not hesitant because I am not a liar. But you are... - Fast? - No! That's not what I meant. Because I too, am not a liar. And I don't want to become a liar. I have seen what happens after the wedding in villages. All men stay together and... women stay in the kitchen. I want a life partner. Will you talk to me after we get married? Or will you stay busy with your work? I love to read and share my knowledge. It's my brother who I kept bothering until now. In the future, it will be you... What if you are not a nice man? Everyone would pretend to be a nice man in the initial meetings. What if we don't love each after we get married? Love is very important. Love? Now what do I say after I go downstairs? What will you say? I will say yes. No matter who it is. I cannot say no this time. Are you done talking? Or do you plan to come down only after you get married? What say? You should ask the girl. It's a yes from her. I told you. - No, you should ask her nicely. - She said yes. Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! She is your daughter now. Jugnu! Jugnu, Mahendra's wedding's fixed! Come meet your sister-in-law. Get some Samosas! "I went thinking that I'll find my soul mate." "I went thinking that I'll find my soul mate." "But I came back losing my soul." "What is love, girl?" "What is love?" "What is love, girl?" "What is love?" "I have done only business since I came into this world." "What is love, I wonder?" "I wonder for the first time." "I have already spent half my life," "The other half is also a waste." "I realised that when I saw your beauty." "I lost sleep and my friends." "Only after I know what love is that i want to die." "What is love, girl?" "What is love?" "What is love, my love?" "What is love?" Long live Chetram! Long live Chetram! Who do we want as our leader? We want Chetram! - Who do we want as our leader? - Greetings. - We want Chetram! - Get out of my way. Long live Chetram! Long live Chetram! Long live Chetram! Long live Chetram! Long live Chetram! You want me to contest in the election? Uncle, we help some poor people. We make donations. But that doesn't mean that we've become the government and we should now run this country. Son, I don't like MLA Chetram. Brother, if someone like you come into power, then we will be rest assured that it won't be misused. You always keep your word. If you'll promise to make a road, you'll make it. Even if the government won't pay you for it, you'll spend the money from your pocket and make it. Son, let me see an honest leader before I die. Fine, if everyone insists, I'll think about it. I was looking for all of you in the courtyard, but all of you are sitting in the backyard. Welcome, uncle. How are you doing, Mahendra? How's Mumbai? Mumbai is full of traffic. Greetings. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings. - Greetings, brother. - Come, Amar Singh. - Uncle Amar Singh! - Uncle! Uncle Amar Singh! - Run, Jugnu! - Uncle, my movies? Forget the movies. First greet him. Greetings, uncle. How are you? All good? The movies? Greetings, son. This contains your movies and songs. You had asked for a camera that gives instant photos? Yes. Here are your DVDs. What is the name of the boy who stays in Mumbai? Jay. He is fooling you. He charged you 5000 for it. It doesn't cost that much. Look! Look! Look! The photo is coming out! This is the camera I was talking about. - So uncle, what were you saying? - This? - The ones that come for 100 bucks are fake. - Jugnu... There are lines on the screen while watching them. There is no use arguing with him, uncle. I see. And it makes sense to argue with you? Uncle Amar Singh, brought me both, the movies and the camera from Mumbai. And you? You couldn't even get me the big screen from Delhi. He is right. The big screen needs to be hanged to a wall to watch a movie. Where did you see it? Huh? Damn! Bro! Both the movies and the screen came on the same day. I am sure a miracle is going to happen now. Mark my words. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Time to watch a movie! Damn! It's huge! We'll turn this place into a cinema hall. This is great! Damn it! Veeru, you go and get pillows and blankets. - Lambe, you get the mattresses! - Okay! Go, go, go! It's here! Alia Bhatt! You want me to drive to Kailash, all by myself? How about dinner? We are not hungry. - Go away. - Movies will make you go crazy. Whatever. - She is so beautiful. - Are you serious? Just one touch can tarnish her beauty. - One look can tarnish her beauty as well. - Oh my God, Vishal! Then don't look at her. Yes, I love you. And you know what? I will love you till my last breath. Because only I have a right over you. Let's watch another movie. Tell me which one. This one. Enough. You guys should go home now. I am feeling sleepy. We'll watch the rest tomorrow. Hey! What are you saying, Jugnu? I've been kicked out of my house. Where will I go? I am not responsible for you. Go sleep at Lamba's house. Why? I won't take him home. Come on! - Ask Veeru... - No ways. I told you to leave! I am feeling sleepy. Go, go, go. Go, Billu. - Take him with you. - I won't take you along. Come on, Billu. I am tiny, my house too is tiny. My bed's tiny as well. Go to your own home. Someone please let me stay at your place. Yes, I love you. And you know what? I will love you till my last breath. Ravi Kishore is the father I never had. Fine, I'll give you a party. Listen, stop, happy rose day. Take it. You take it. Get lost. Happy now? - Did you place one near the library? - Where are you taking it? I am putting it across the college. I had made 50 of them. I have placed them everywhere. You see the arrangement? I did it. Once I become the president, I'll turn this college into a lover's paradise. - President? - Yes? You are playing English songs. Do you even understand English? Why? You think I don't? My English is much better than yours. I am not as good as Jaibeer though. - Really? - Really. Then say something in English. - Should I? - You should. Bastard. Don't tell us who you are. Tell us about this college. Okay, tell me the meaning of this song, I want to break free. Give me something different. This is a piece of cake. I want to break free? I... want to bash up for free. Awesome! That's our president! - I am awesome, ain't I? - Come, have a seat. - I am good in all languages. - Right, of course. We were sitting over here. So what? We are sitting here now. You go and sit over there. Why should we sit over there? You go and sit over there. - Forget it, let's go. - "Break free! I wanna break free!" - Let's go. - "Break free! I wanna break free!" I might have to go to America after I become the president. Okay, go and get my book. Fine. - Hurry up. - Okay. Bye. Dude? Why didn't you get up when that girl asked you to? She is a friend of mine. It was just a joke, dude. If you don't believe me then go and ask her. You are a PhD student, right? Yes. What is your name? Vijay. Vijay Deenanath Chauhan? Don't joke. Concentrate on your studies, okay? What's wrong, bro? Nothing. I was just asking something about PhD. - You want to do PhD? - Yes, let's go. - I'll get you the degree. - Let's go. I'll bring it to your home. He gave him a tight slap. Very good. - Come, my boy. - Let him come. - Stop. Don't break his bones. - Greetings, everyone. - Uncle. - Greetings, uncle. - Greetings, uncle. - Greetings, uncle. Listen up, everyone. I have decided to contest for the election. Will all of you support me? Yes, of course. We'll always have your back, Mahendra. You come here, brother. We don't want you standing behind. We want you to stand with us. Right next to me. Of course, I'll stand with you. Yes, brother. You have our support. Uncle? "I'll get you a beautiful girl who wears earrings." Get her. - Are you sure? - I am sure. How about I sing you a Ragni tonight? Go for it. Should we go for it, Mahendra? Go for it. Ragni's fixed for tonight! We'll all party tonight! You've won my heart! - "Your intoxicating eyes..." - You go. "Your intoxicating eyes..." Mahendra! How are you? I am good. I am good. "Your eyes..." What brings you to my village? Oh, it's your uncle's house. Is that Mahendra? Why did he run away? I was standing straight even after having one full bottle. - I was with... - Hey! Where were you? Rohtas, I met Bimla. Sister-in-law Bimla? We aren't married as yet. You will be, brother. Call her that after we get married. Listen, I met Bimla. I didn't know what to say to her. So, I gave her money. How much? Around... What difference does it make? I mean why? I don't know why! You are such a flop, bro. You gave money to a girl? Come on, brother. Learn to express love. You spend far too much time with men! Today, I'll sing for you. "Your eyes are a deadly weapon..." "Sister-in-law's eyes are a deadly weapon..." "She has hurt my poor brother." "She fills her pot with water and leaves." "Uncle started following her around." "Her intoxicating eyes..." "Turned an old man into a pervert." "Uncle!" "I'll get you a beautiful girl who wears earrings." "Uncle!" "I'll get you a beautiful girl who wears earrings." "Uncle, I'll get you remarried." "Uncle, I'll get you remarried." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who dances." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who dances." "Uncle, I'll get you to fall in love again." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who wears earrings." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who dances." "They were madly in love with each other." "But aunt passed away." "He smokes hookah all by himself." "All his brothers are gone as well." "Grandma says, someone get him something to eat." "She says, get him a new bride." "Uncle!" "Uncle, let me help bring your blood pressure up again." "Uncle, let me help bring your blood pressure up again." "Let me get someone to cut onions for you." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who wears earrings." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who dances." "There is no right age to fall in love, to be happy." "We need someone who will wash his clothes." "Your kids don't look after you." "Let me get you someone who'd look after you." "You have spent your life running around." "Let me make you feel lucky now." "Listen, let me make your nights beautiful again." "Let me arrange for the confectioners." "Let me bring the twinkle back into your eyes." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who wears earrings." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who dances." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who wears earrings." "Uncle, I'll get you a beautiful girl who dances." "Uncle, let me..." "Uncle, let me..." "Damn, uncle!" Let's race, Veeru. Let it be, you always win. You are already as long as the canal. Get lost, you mouse! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Your nail is hurting me. Let me go, bro. Let me go, bro. Bro! Come on! Hey! What's wrong? You dogs! What's wrong with him? What's wrong? Let him go. We are going. Hey... he is crying. Jugnu? Jugnu? What's wrong? Hey... What's wrong, Jugnu? I hope you aren't crying because you slapped them. Stop it. He didn't even slap you. You can slap us again if you want, but don't cry. Slap me, you missed me. Jugnu? Jugnu? Stop it. You guys keep joking. There is something called as pain, bro. Do you know what pain is? Huh? I know what toothache feels like. My mother suffered from it. Toothache. The worst kind of pain. Have you ever been kicked there? Your eyes will pop out. Look, all kinds of pain are dangerous. But the pain one has when one has a kidney stone is... Stop it, guys. Lambe... I am talking about heartache. It is the worst kind of pain. Have you ever asked me... why do I look so lost these days? Why do I watch movies alone? Which movie did you watch alone? Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania. Now ask me... why do I keep so quiet these days? Why do I roam around all by myself? Why, bro? Are you suffering from a disease? Yes Lambe, I am suffering from a disease. And this disease is known as love. I am in love... madly in love. I feel as if my heart will blow up. Oh God, what should I do? It just happened. It is not my fault. Love does that to you. You never realise when you fall in love. Who did you fall in love with, bro? Alia Bhatt. Huh? Hey! God gave me a heart and Alia Bhatt stole it. How is it my fault? Tell me! Tell me Lambe, how is it my fault? Tell me! So, what kind of love is this? It is real or just a phase? It is real. What do you mean by just a phase? - I mean... - Shh! He means when you close your eyes do you see her face or her... Right. Stop your nonsense! Try it. Hmm. Yes. Yes. Her smiling face. Wow, he's done for. You are in love, stupid! Real love! This is awesome! She is so lucky. A boy from such an affluent family fell in love with her. We've seen many like you! Let it be! You let it be! Not like this. Everyone will get a chance to speak. You go ahead. Has there ever been a day when you came to me for some work, and I acted arrogant and said that I won't do it? What do you want, uncle? What do you want, Mahendra? Someone else to win the election while we keep fighting with each other? Chetram, you can join us. If gun could resolve matters then all security guards would become police officers. See you then. Give me your blessings, brother. I am going to file my nomination. May God bless everyone. Don't worry. It will be okay. We'll start canvassing from tomorrow. Blow some air into it. Add some potatoes in it. Cottage cheese get priority over potatoes. - Brother is here. - I don't like this. I will hit him. What don't you like? I don't like him. I'll... Heed my advice. How many times to have to tell you to calm down, Fauji? Add some more. What is going on? - Greetings, brother. - Fritters and all, huh? Join us, brother. Are you guys celebrating someone's birthday? Have a seat, brother. Sit down. - Get it quickly. - Coming. - Hurry up. - Sit. Sit down, Fauji. - I prefer standing. - Here you go, brother. What is this? Cottage cheese, brother. Here, have some cottage cheese. - Sure, brother. - Give me some as well. Brother, I want to discuss something very important with you. Brother... Jugnu's life has changed. Hmm. So, what happened? Tell me. Jugnu wants to get married, brother. Get married? So soon? Jaibeer is still... Forget that. Do you like someone? Ask him who she is. - That's when the fun will begin. - Yes. Who is she? Alia. Who is here? No one is here, brother. Her name is Alia. What kind of a name is that? Where is she from? She is a movie star, brother. - She is very famous. - Right. She works in the movies? Are you trying to fool me? Huh? Did you have cannabis? Lambe? It is true, brother. Alia Bhatt. She is a heroine. She is Humpty Sharma's bride. She is married? Not in real life, brother. She got married in the movie. Jugnu will marry her, brother. He is in love. Love? Where did you meet? They never met, brother. He saw her in the movie. He saw her movie and fell in love with her. Uh-huh. Let's go, Fauji. Why did you say that you'll get me married to a queen. I said a queen not an actress. You are crazy. How can you just watch a movie and... fall in love? Kiddo, you are naïve. You cannot get married just like that, you stupid boy. Brother, I will get married to Alia only. And you will get me married to her. And how will I do that? You are my elder brother. You will have to take my proposal to her. Or do you want to ruin my reputation. People will say that your younger brother eloped and got married. God bless you. What is this new mess? Look kiddo, you can talk about them, you can click a picture with them, you can even take their autograph, but you cannot marry them... I am not her fan, brother. I love her. Kiddo, I am getting very angry now. Fine then let it be. I will stay single. I anyway don't have parents who'd worry about me. I'll give you a tight slap! It's okay. - He's your elder brother. - It's okay. Look at him. Don't scold him. He's just a kid. We'll lose everything if he does something untoward. Talk to him, brother. Jugnu... Jugnu, listen to me. Please hear me out. What did you say her name was? Alia. I see, so her name is Alia. Is she very beautiful? Yes, brother. - She looks like a doll. - Yes. A bunch of idiots! All of you go and stand over there. Sorry, sorry, sorry. So this Alia, is she very beautiful? Tell me, Jugnu. Is she fair? Does she have a dusky skin? She is very fair, brother. She has big eyes and a sweet voice. She is different than the rest. I'll be damned. You're madly in love with her. Once you get over her, I'll find a nice, beautiful girl for you. - Okay? - No, brother. Alia and I, we are made for each other. Hmm? Can we discuss this tomorrow morning? When we are completely sober? Okay. Okay then. I'll have these beers shoved up your... You should limit your intake. Go. Go to sleep. Brother said he'll discuss this tomorrow morning. Get it. Take it along. You saw what he did, brother? Do people do this when they are in love? How would I know? Look, we learnt a new thing today. Had anyone imagined such a twist in our story? Now that you have taken it, you might as well open it. Open it, Fauji. Hey kids, go outside and play. Go on. Go outside and play. Mahendra, I can take up the responsibility of villages Dhol, Reva and Chidi. As for the other villages, we will only know the scene once we go there for canvassing. Hello? Rs 340 for a sack and 170 for half a sack. - Rohtas? - Okay? Hold on. Yes, brother? Can you take your stupid matter somewhere else? Oh, I see. I said 340 for the sack... What's the total number of votes? Of our Jats? Mr. Chaudhary, Everyone is ours. Otherwise, why do I even need to do this? Okay, Mahendra. I'll go and get the list of all voters. That's not how it is done. It is done like this. - Hello, brother-in-law. - Hi. Well... I go mum whenever you are in front of me. - Then give me money. - Yes, that's... That's... I mean, don't misunderstand me. Otherwise you will be called a sinner. I didn't know what else to do. I keep giving money to Jaibeer and Jugnu, my younger brothers. That's why. You too are younger to me. Would you have some tea? I don't drink tea. How's Jugnu? Jugnu is crazy. He keeps watching movies 24/7. You'll find this funny. There is an actress, Alia. Alia Bhatt? Yes, have you heard of her? He is in love with her. Really? He wants me take his wedding proposal to her. Then? Let's see how long this madness lasts. Here you go, Mahendra. The list of all voters. Okay, I'll get going then. Greetings, uncle. Greetings, son. Greetings. Come. Achintram, Mahendra is your son-in-law later, first I am your friend... Greetings, brother. Greetings, brother. What happened? He fell from a cycle. Don't. Look at his fake leg and his amputated leg. Friction between the two caused this injury. Jaibeer, why were you riding a cycle? Fauji? Okay. Okay. Let's go. Cycle? To exercise? You could do something else. You could do push-ups or something. I know. I won't make this mistake again. It's me who is hurting. Only you are hurting? - Even if I get shot... - I know. Sorry. I'll be more careful next time. Hey hero, how are you doing? I am good, brother. You shouldn't ride a cycle. Did you hear him? Your little brother too doesn't want you to. Rohtas. Yes, brother? What? I have it. Keep it. It will come in handy. How's sister-in-law doing? We'll get going now. Okay. You should call. You never come to the village. I will. I'll come once my exams are over. Promise? Promise. Brother, I too have an Alia... Yeah, yeah, it's time to leave. Let's go. - I won't tell him. - Take care. Why didn't you let me tell Jaibeer? What didn't I let you tell him? You know what. What didn't he let you tell him? Mahendra? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing, really? Son? Jugnu? What's wrong? What's wrong, Mahendra? Will someone tell me anything? Stop it now. Heard his story, uncle? Now explain it to him. He thinks I am his enemy. Whats the sweet girl's name? Alia. No one is here, uncle. Her name is Alia. Alia Bhatt. Seems beautiful.. No one is more beautiful than Jaya Prada. Hmm. Mahendra, boy likes a girl. His family takes his proposal to her family. And they get married. This is only possible if the girl is of the same caste. Only the girl liked by the boy deserves to be his bride. Forget the caste, the girl stays miles away. Moreover, she works in film industry. Film actresses aren't less than anyone. They have a lot of money. How do you know? I have heard so. Have you guys lost your mind? Our boy's life is at stake and you guys are talking about rumours? What is this, brother? I'll never get married if someone learns that this is how I discuss my love life. Let it be. I'll handle it on my own. Come here, Jugnu. Come here, my boy. You saw how crazy he is, uncle? I don't care. You have to go there with my wedding proposal. All of us are looking nice today. This all arrangement... Has been done by me. So enjoy the party. I have made special arrangements for snacks. There are fewer people on the snacks counter now. - Shall we go there? - Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, Jaibeer. Let's call the president as well. He's on the stage. He, too, will have some. "I am gone." "I am gone." "I am gone." You don't just learn from the books. College teaches you something new every day. You sometimes learn about friends, and sometimes about love. Our president is here. - Salute! - Sit down. You are talking about love? What do you have to do with love? Darling, I was born to love. Satpal, you know, what the midwife said at my birth? What? Mr. Love is here. Wow! He will love everyone. He will look after everyone. Everyone will stay happy and in peace. I have taken up that responsibility. Let it be. You can only talk nonsense. Bro? What bro? No one is safe if their leader is like you. Neither a boy or a girl. What are you saying, bro? - You are saying that? - Yes, I am. You know that no one can even dare look at a girl from our college. - I'll break his bones! - "I'll break his bones!" How many names do I take? What's that nice girl's name? Vasudha. Didn't you see that boy chasing her? What's his name Vijay something. - The PhD guy? - Yes, the PhD guy. You didn't see him chasing her? She is a Jat. We don't even know his caste. Why am I even saying this to you? It's not like you'll do something about this. No way you will become a president. He wants to mingle with us. Get out. Get up. - What is it, bro? - Where can I find the PhD guy, Vijay? Hey... What's wrong, Jeetu? Where can I find that PhD guy, Vijay? - What's wrong? - Come on out. Let's go. What's wrong? - Vijay? - What? Look behind you. You bastard! What's wrong, bro? - You are romancing a Jat girl, huh? - Why are you beating me up? Let me teach you a lesson. Here you go. What's wrong? What's happening? I'll disfigure you so bad that not even a donkey will look at you. Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! You want to flirt with our girls, huh? Long live Mahendra Sheoran Long live Mahendra Sheoran! Long live Mahendra Sheoran! Long live Mahendra Sheoran! We are ready! Our symbol is a turban! We are ready! Our symbol is a turban! Long live Mahendra Sheoran! Long live Mahendra Sheoran! Long live Mahendra Sheoran! Long live Mahendra Sheoran! Look at that. We are fully prepared. - Election symbol is Turban. - Long live Mahendra Sheoran! Long live Mahendra Sheoran! Jugnu? 15% off on a motorbike. - Shishpal? - Yes? Shall we buy him one. Okay. You won't get me one. You just keep saying that you will. So you won't give this up. Give up that? What else can I talk to you about? Let it be. Then go! Go to Mumbai! Go to Mumbai. Meet her, talk to her. I'll take your wedding proposal if you both like each other. Are you telling the truth? You won't go back on your word? I don't know why I am entertaining this, but I have no other option. You are doing the right thing, brother. You don't need to do anything else. This is the right decision. - Can I take Lambe, Veeru and Rocky along? - Huh? It's a very big city. You are taking your wedding party with you? You will be leading that, brother. Brother Rohtas, book four flight tickets for us. Brother, please tell him to do it. Book the tickets. We want to stay in a five star hotel. Okay? Come on boys, pack your bags. Lambe! Brother? What is this, brother? This is the right decision, Mahendra. Jugnu! Jaibeer, I am taking your shirt. That girl, Vasudha, she is having an affair with that boy. Jeetu not only thrashed that boy but also told the girl's family about her affair. I heard that she tried to commit suicide. But she survived. Everyone's talking about it in the college. Love affairs are such a messy thing. Stop at a nice restaurant and feed them. - Make sure everything is in order. - Okay. - I hope they don't have issues on the way. - They won't. - Let's go. - Grandma. Give it here. Give it here. Move aside, fatso. Go, go, go. - Uncle? - Bless me, uncle. Bless you. You look good. What are you doing, brother? I cannot go if you do this. Really? No, I am going for sure. I don't want to have regrets of not meeting the girl before the wedding. Have a safe journey, son. Okay, grandma. I'll get a sexy daughter-in-law for you. - What is he saying? - Go. Jugnu, why aren't you taking me along? Tell Alia I am her best brother-in-law. Move aside, Billu. Say my hello to her. - You can say hello to her at my wedding! - Jugnu! Jugnu! He's just a kid. He has left the house for the first time. We never even sent him to Hisar alone. And we directly sent him to Mumbai. Don't worry. Hello? This is Mahendra speaking. Can I talk to Mr. Chaudhary? Father has gone to the market. I'll call on his mobile phone. Was it something urgent? Bimla... Hmm? Jugnu has gone to Mumbai. I only sent him. He wasn't letting it go. I sent him but now I don't know whether I did the right thing. You did the right thing. Mark my words, he will come back smarter. Sometimes you need to give them freedom rather than protect them. Hmm. If I ever want to talk to you... **50789114 Come... **507... Hello? I thought I forgot the number. You got the right number. "Take me for a Shikara ride." "Give me a tour of Kashmir, my love." "I am always at home." "Take me on a world tour." "Paint a picture where we both are smiling." "Take me for a Shikara ride." "Give me a tour of Kashmir, my love." "You have changed the way I think." "I don't sleep a wink." "I count stars at night." "I don't know if you know this, or not..." "I have started falling for you." "Your eyes spoil me." "Winds caress me." "I dress up for you." "You make my destiny beautiful." "Give me a reason to absentmindedly nick my finger." "Take me for a Shikara ride." "Give me a tour of Kashmir, my love." "Your intoxicating eyes..." "Your intoxicating eyes..." "Melody" "Your eyes..." "My heart races..." "O' My love." "I don't like anything without you..." "O' My love." "I belong to you." "You are my soul mate." "I will always fulfil your dreams." "I'll dedicate..." "My entire life to you, my love." "To you, my love." You can only play with top hole not the others? Listen carefully. You will come straight home from college. I'll be damned. This girl is courageous. She came to college despite everything? So bro, now tell me, don't I deserve to be the president? I'll look after everyone. I've thrashed him so bad, that now no one from the other caste will even look at Jat girls. Great. Awesome, bro. But why did you have to tell her family? You also told everyone in the college. Let it be. No, bro. I always finish the job. I am Jeetu. This is how I do justice. But I just did the job. It is Jaibeer who delivered justice here. Right, bro? Jeetu! Jeetu! Your posters are here! - Really? - Yes. The one where I am wearing goggles? - Blue one? Or the red one? - Let's go attend the class. Let's go. Taxi! Stop it! - What are you doing, Jugnu? - Are you an illiterate? Have you never seen an aeroplane , huh? Have you never seen educated people? Tell me, where have we seen such people, huh? In the movies? Lambe and I too saw them only in the movies. This is wrong, Rocky. And you...! What were you doing? Why were you talking to the airhostess? Is she your cousin? She said thank you to me. I thought she liked something about me. She thanked everyone. That's her job. Wait. Everyone, behave yourselves. Got it? Jugnu, we'll send them back if they misbehave again. A bunch of idiots. - Welcome boys! - Hey! Uncle? What is this, uncle? A car? - You call this a car? - Yes. You should've brought a horse carriage instead. You couldn't find a smaller car? I'll arrange for a bigger car tomorrow. We have to go directly to the hotel today. Welcome to Mumbai! - Get in, Jugnu. - Load everything up, guys. "With a twinkle in our eyes we proceed..." Stop the car, uncle. Our sister-in-law, Alia. Sister-in-law! "With open arms, Mumbai welcomes us." Look over there. He is taking a piss. Hey! - Go away! - I'll hit you! - Go away! - "This is Mumbai...!" "We are in Mumbai!" "Mumbai!" [indistinct chatter] What's wrong, uncle? Why is it taking so long? Just give me a moment, sir. There was some confusion about the IDs. It's sorted now. Do you want both the rooms to be together? Sir? - Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! - Move! Let's check it out! I'll get going now, Jugnu. I'll be back tomorrow. Damn! It is great. These two rooms, sir. - Here you go, bro. - Thank you, sir. Keep these bags in that room. - Okay, sir. - Okay? Jugnu! Come here, bro. Come here. Look at this. It's like a house. There's one television in this room and... Come with me! Look at this! There's another television in this room! Look at this! Such a soft bed! Bro! Look at the bathtub, Jugnu. Listen, guys! Listen! Come here, everyone. Sit over here. Come here. Come here. Listen bro, don't act surprised over everything. Hmm? Look at them like it's quite a common sight for us. I see. You are right, bro. Did everyone get it? - Yes. - Yes. Tell me, when do we meet sister-in-law Alia? Man... You know what I think? It's Alia who'd teach us the ways of this place. I'll sit on her lap and learn everything. You want to be her favourite, huh? You want to sit in my lap? Jugnu, if he gets to sit on the lap then I too want a chance. Good evening, how may I help you? They always talk in English. Then how about we go downstairs to eat? Plz order room service. I've just caught my breath. Yes, Lambe. Why don't you go to your room? We'll sleep here only. What if we go there and someone comes talking in English? We are scared. Yes brother, everything's fine. Yes, the rooms are very good. Brother, stop calling me repeatedly. I am not a kid. I'll call you. And yes... Once I meet Alia, I'll make her family to talk to you. Okay? What's wrong? Vijay? Who is it? It's me Jaibeer, bro. I came to ask how you are doing. I have been getting threatening calls since yesterday. Since when are you and Vasudha... It has been two years, bro. What was your intention? Marriage? Yes. I got a job in Hong Kong. Vasudha wanted to elope. She perhaps knew. But I thought caste wouldn't matter. But it matters. Caste matters. I slapped him. He touched my cap. I have grown my hair. Jeetu... Hmm? That boy, Vijay... Hmm? And that girl, Vasudha? They love each other. Right? It is my fault. I didn't know. We'll do one thing. We'll stay away from them. Okay, bro? Enjoy your meal. Bye. Why? Is she pregnant? Damn! Hey... What is going on, bro? You should tell us what is going on. It's okay. The story is over, right? I'll explain it to Jeetu. Explain it to me right now. Explain it to me very clearly. I do everything for him and he humiliates me in front of everyone. What should I do now? Forget it. It's not a big deal. It's over. Listen, will you have mutton tonight? I'll cook it. Have it. I make it well. Hooda, go and get beer. - Okay. - No. I'll get the beer. We'll drink all night long. And in the morning we will break the bottle outside Vasudha's house... Bloody animal.. Stop, Jaibeer... I told you to stop it. Don't you get it? - Jaibeer? - I told you to stay away from them! Why are you thrashing him? What's wrong? - Go away. - Don't act stupid. Go. Today's mutton is made. Leave. - Move aside, Lambe. - Move. I too want to get ready. Move aside, I too want to use the mirror. - Stop it. - You are so stupid. Good morning, Jugnu. Your first morning in Mumbai! Just imagine, Alia must have just woken up. Right? She doesn't even know who is in Mumbai to meet her. Jugnu, look, he has turned it into a canal. I'll go to my room and turn mine into a canal as well. Close the door. Come out soon. Lambe. - Yes? - Come here. Tell me. I am feeling a little scared, bro. Huh? Boy, there is no one like you, not just in Haryana but in the whole world. You get that? You are just nerves. It will go away. Come on, get ready. We'll eat downstairs today. I promise. Time to get out of your canal, Veeru. Rocky, I'm coming! The whole menu book is in English. They have given strange names to the dishes. They have photos on the next page. Green rice. And this is some kind of a vegetable. Hello sir, are you ready to order? No problem sir, take your time. Even the waiters talk in English. Look around, there are so many people here. Yet it is so quite in here. They are all feeling suffocated from inside. Their forks and spoons are making more noise than them. Let's go and eat at Alia's place. Yes, of course. I'll call her up and tell her, "Darling, quickly cook something." "We are coming over for lunch." Stupid. Now are you ready to order, sir? This is where your Alia stays. Here, oranges, apples... - And a dozen bananas. - Okay. You didn't get pomegranate? Oh no. Don't feel shy. If you get stuck, just make her family talk to Brother. Give my regards to sister-in-law. Call us over after some time. Yes. I have booked the tickets. I don't know whether it will get confirmed or not. A lot of people are traveling back to their villages. Yes, that is true. It will get confirmed. Let's see if I am able to go home or not. You'll go, don't worry. Hello, sir. Which apartment do you want to go to? Alia's. Alia madam's apartment? Make an entry in the register. What should I tell them your name is? I am Mahendra Singh Sheoran's younger brother, Jugnu. I am staying in a five star hotel. Sign over here. Your intercom never works. Listen, Alia's designer is about to come over. Rouble. Let his car come in. Okay? Ma'am, he is here to meet Alia ma'am. Is he the same guy? Hi. You are not Rouble. What's your name? Do you have an appointment? Hello? You will lose your job. He is a nobody. Ask him to leave. Please leave. Leave. Don't touch me. I am leaving. Go. Go. Leave. I wonder where such idiots come from! He is still standing there. Huh? You still haven't left? - Go! - Get lost! Go! Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Let's go, let's go, let's go. - What's wrong? You are back so soon? Let's go. But what happened? What did Alia say? What do you mean what did she say? You think she was standing at the gate? You came back from the gate? Why? They didn't let you go inside? Why wouldn't they let me go inside? I came back on my own. I am not dressed well. - I see. - Let's go buy some new clothes. Yes, let's go, uncle. We all will buy new clothes. Right, Jugnu? We all will buy new clothes. - Come on! - Coming! - Don't talk nonsense. - I won't wear it. Tell him, Rohtas. I won't wear it, Mahendra. I'll never wear a suit. You'll look nice. We all will wear it. Quiet. - Wear it. - jaibeer. Jaibeer, I knew you wouldn't buy any clothes for the wedding so I... What happened? Hey... Who did this? I asked, who did this? Let him go, brother. Let him go. Please. We went to a restaurant to eat, brother. There... Jaibeer? Yes? Drag him! Drag him! Come on. Let Jaibeer go! What's wrong? Let Jaibeer go, man! MLA Chetram's brother-in-law, Sikka. Who? The one who contested in the election last time. They were his men. What is going on? Go back, brother. These things happen in college. Say that when I die as well. These things happen! People die. Brother, there is a girl called Vasudha. This happened because of her. There is a boy called Jeetu in our college, brother. He fought with him as well a few days back. - What did you say his name was? - Jeetu. - Jeetu? - Yes. Let's go. - Come with me. - Coming. Which hostel is he in? Who is Vasudha? I am your brother. Vasudha is a Jat. She is having an affair with a boy. He is not a Jat. I want them to get married. Is she a friend of yours? What kind of love is this, brother? If you want to fight for someone, fight for yourself. I'll go and talk to her parents. I couldn't say it even if I had both my legs. Your brother is not a nice man, brother. I got Vijay beaten up, her... She tried to commit suicide. All this is happening because of me. - No, don't... - Brother, they've made it a caste issue. They won't spare the boy and even the girl. - How dare they! - I'll get them married. Jaibeer! You'll get them married. You'll only get them married. Don't you trust me? - Mahendra. - Yes? This is the boy. Jeetu. Come here, Jeetu. Come with me and tell me who is responsible for it. - Come on. - Let's go. - It was a mistake, brother. - Let's go. Fauji, call Bir Singh and ask him to meet us at Sirsa road with a couple of his men. How are you doing, Mr. Chaudhary? Mahendra. You'll call me Mr. Chaudhary, huh? I am your uncle. We didn't know that Jaibeer is your brother. He had to be someone's brother. You knew that, didn't you? You are contesting an election, nephew. Be smart and stay out of this. A Jat girl is having an affair. Boy belongs to another caste. The girl has a right to do as she pleases. No, nephew, how can we allow that? We too have daughters. So? What will you do then? Kill them? There are people more powerful than me. It doesn't take long to hang someone from a tree. We'll make them tomorrow's headlines. This news has reached some wrong people, brother. They can go to any extent in the name of caste. I'll talk to the SP. Get them married under police protection today itself and send them out of here. Will you be able to this? Let's go. Let's go. There they are, sitting in the corner. Having lentils? Who all were they? Him, him and him as well. He too was with them. But not him. You can leave, kiddo. Go. Pawan? Yes, brother? Get a brick. You know why this is happening? Will this bone be fine? It looks fine, brother. I think you should aim a little lower. Go for his knee, Mahendra. Go for his knee. - His knee? - Yes. Where are you going? Don't you think we thrashed him too hard? - Fauji? - Yes? No, he's still breathing. Make sure they get the right treatment. You want us to take care of that? Who broke the bones? - We should also get them a tetanus shot. - Yes. Take the responsibility of their wedding as well! - I was just joking. - Let's go. You...! He must be in pain, Fauji. Don't make me break your nose. - Did you book the tickets? - Yes, bro. What time is the flight? 12:30 am. How do I thank you, bro? You are an angel. No, bro. It's okay. Stay well, stay happy. - Okay? - Okay, bro. Thank you, bro. Bye. - Bye, bro. - Bye. Take care. - Bye, bro. See you. - Thank you. Bye-bye. All this reminds me of my grandma. All this? Yes. Grandma used to say big cities are on fire. My father will get a heart attack if he sees this. I am surprised at how open-minded they are. She is your sister-in-law, close your eyes. Then tell my sister-in-law to put some clothes on. - Let it be. - Jugnu! Jugnu! We are stupid to keep wandering at useless places! Manager told me all movie stars visit famous discos at night. I see. That's where they mingle with the high-society. High-society means, people like us. Which disco? Look, I have a list of all of them. Well done, Lambe. - Lambe, my man! - Well done, Lambe. Let's take over Mumbai, guys! And unite our brother with his love. Oh. What are you doing? Oh, my God! What is going on? This is so funny. I'll be damned. Look, she is unwell yet she wants to go to a disco. They are stamping the ones who are going inside. Will they stamp us as well? They'll stamp your forehead. - Stop your nonsense, you dog. - Welcome. Should I tell you where they will stamp you, huh? No stag entry. - Please move to the side. - Huh? Go. Please, side. - Side. - What is he saying, Jugnu? - Girls. - I don't know. What is going on? Why isn't he letting us in? I don't know. Jay! Jugnu, look, Jay! - Jay! - Jugnu! Guys, come, come, come. - Jay! - Bro! What's up, Jugnu? How are you doing? When did you come to Mumbai? Wait, wait, wait. Guys, meet them. Guys, you remember I told you that my bus broke down during my Rajasthan trip? These guys helped me a lot. Very nice guys. Very nice. Hey, I'd sent you some movies. Did you get them? Yes, yes. Tell me, are you going to the disco? Yes, obviously. Let's go. He isn't letting us in. - Yes. - Why? He said... what was it? Yes, he said, "no sta, no sta." Stag! Stag! He means you cannot go inside if you don't have a girl accompanying you. Oh, I see. That's why that guy brought a sick girl here. To get an entry. I see. What do we do now, bro? It will cost you. Money?! You should have told me! Look over here. Let's go, guys. - Let's go, bro. - Let's go, Lambe. These four. Enjoy! Come, girls. I'll have no regrets even if I die today. Don't talk about dying, Veeru. We feel alive for the first time! This is the real deal! This is the real Mumbai! True, bro! Jugnu, give me some cash. I'll buy us some alcohol. Here. Yeah! Loosen up, guys. We are at the right place. Excuse me, do you have a lighter? Do you have a lighter? Hey, there a girl tried to talk to me. Really? What did she say? I didn't understand. She was talking in English. - Then you should have spoken to her in Hindi. - Right. I couldn't gather the courage to. Here, this will give you some courage. - Go for it. - Go, go, go. - Go, give it to Jay. - Okay. Come with me. I'll get you more courage. You are a very good dancer. She ran away. Should I follow her? Are you a goon? Don't misbehave. - You can roam around, but don't misbehave. - Okay. Hey! Are you drunk? What's wrong? This guy has been pinching me. And I think he's drunk. No. I... What? Let me explain. That guy... I'll go and find him, sister. Or come with me, I'll show you who did it. - Look at the way he is talking. - How! Idiot! You! Get lost right now from here. No sister, you are not getting it. Come with me, I'll show you who did it. You moron! Idiot! Sister? Shut up. You... you don't get it. How dare... how dare you touch me! You cheap! - Excuse me! - Sister... Excuse me, ma'am. What happened, ma'am? - I'll show you who did it. - What's going on? This guy, he has been touching me inappropriately. - No brother, I... - This is the kind of crowd that comes here? - No, no! - I'll... I'll take care of it. If you know Hindi then explain it to her. Wait, brother. - Do you know Hindi? Explain it to her. - Wait, wait, wait. - Shut up! - I am not wrong, madam. - Just shut up! - You misunderstand me. Wait, bro. Wait, brother. - Don't touch him. Don't touch him. - Tell her! - I'm with him. What's the problem? - Sir, this guy is troubling girls. - Hey, please don't talk. Get... get this guy out right now. - Madam, madam... - One minute, I am talking to him. - Please try to understand. Girls are involved, bro. Try to understand. Try to understand. Try to understand. Tell us what happened, Jugnu. - Someone was pinching her. - Okay. - Give us a minute. Give us a minute. - She thought I did it. - Take your hands off me. - No, bro. I couldn't speak in English so... It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - Madam, sorry. Sorry from my side. - Madam... - Stop saying sorry, just get...get...! - Just take him out. - I'm doing that. I'm doing that. - Yes, yes, yes. - Please try to understand. You misunderstand. We are not miscreants. Wait, wait, wait. Listen... - What's going on? - Manager! Look at what he is doing. Jugnu, no! Manager! - Manager! - Stop it! That's enough. Jay, let us handle this. - Who do you think you are? - Hey guys don't, it's okay. How dare you touch us! How dare you touch us! Jugnu, stop. Get out! Hey guys, Jugnu... Jugnu... Jugnu... Jugnu's gone there. - Jugnu... - Stop it. - Manager! - Jugnu! Jugnu! Jugnu! The girl who slapped me? You think she knows Hindi? Of course, she does. Then why did she look at me like I was speaking in some third-rate language? Look Jugnu, try to understand. There is one society where we live. There we can talk in any language we want, Hindi, Guajarati, Marathi. But when we step out, like for example when we go to a hotel, go to a disco, we talk in English. I know that. You leave a good impression if you talk in English. But you shouldn't feel ashamed to speak in Hindi either. For example, if two people know Hindi, then in a disco they can talk in Hindi, can't they? It's just another language. You look like you've come from a good family if you talk in English. That's the case. Hello? My life's ruined. Huh? Who is this? A village bumpkin. Jugnu? Not Jugnu, a village bumpkin. You know forget getting married to me, the heroines here won't even talk to me. What is wrong, Jugnu? All big people here talk in English. Only in English. They throw people like me out. They don't even listen to me. Where are you, Jugnu? In a well. You have turned me into a frog in a well, brother. I have never stepped out of my village. The world outside is completely different. What do I know? Sorry and thank you. No, no. Don't worry, son. You can always learn. What all will I learn? And where do I begin from? Brother, you have ruined my life. Look kiddo, Jugnu... Where is Lamba? Where else will he be? He is standing right behind me. Imagine, there is someone behind me as well. Let me talk to him. Lambe? Yes, brother? What's wrong, Lambe? It's nothing, brother. The atmosphere here is quite different. Are Veeru and Rocky with you? Yes, brother. They are all here. Stay together. Okay? And stay together at night as well. Don't leave Jugnu alone. Got it? Yes, brother. Okay, brother. Brother is coming over tomorrow. Greetings, brother. Greetings! Greetings, uncle. You come here. Come with me. Let me take that. Give it to me. Let's go, guys. Are you alright? This? What is this, brother? Have you brought my wedding party along? Tell me why were you sounding so sad last night? What happened? What's wrong? Do you see that small car? Uncle Amar Singh has been taking us around in it since we came here. There is no car smaller than this one in Mumbai. Stupid boy, which car do you want? I can even get an aeroplane for my brother. Stupid. Look uncle Amar Singh has rented a house for our stay. You can stay in your five star hotel. Keep Billu with you. No brother, I'll go with you. I don't want to stay in a five star hotel. Fine, let's go. Get into the car, guys. You come with me. Let's go. How much further is it? I really need to pee. There's an empty bottle at the back? Should I give it to you? Stop, stop, stop. Where are you going? I don't want to pee in my pants. Oh God! Hurry up! Look at this beautiful sight, Billu! Such a big sea! It's even bigger than Lamba. Really? You know, it is so big so big that no one can measure. Water for miles and miles. If that water reaches here, we'll all drown. We got to see Mumbai because of Jugnu. Otherwise, we'd spend all our life in the village. It was not Jugnu's fault. The girls misunderstood. They slapped her. We were not with him at that moment. Scoundrels! You let our boy get beaten up? Did we send you to Mumbai to go sightseeing? They were girls, brother. Then you should have thrashed some boys around them. That would have been enough to scare the girls. Take a tour of Mumbai for a couple of days then book everyone's return ticket. Do you want to go back? I don't want to face anymore humiliation here. Won't you give your brother a chance? Balram, you must know someone in Mumbai? How can you not know anyone? - You are such a liar. - Hello? You made such tall claims. "I know this one, I know that one. "Why aren't you self-aware?" "Why are you so surprised at this world?" Don't talk to that guy. Talk to this guy. He went abroad? - Hello? - No, problem. "There is always a way." "You just need to watch where you are going." "Why have you stopped breathing?" "Take a deep breath." No, I am not in Hisar. I am in Mumbai. Hang up, you idiot! - "Why don't you ask them what the problem is?" - Karan Singh. Hello? Where are you, Karan Singh? In Mumbai? We too are in Mumbai. Where are we? Where are we?! By the seaside. Yes.... - Idiot! - I'll text you the address. "This is nothing but an illusion." "Just an illusion." "Just an illusion." Shake hand. Good boy. Hi-five. Good boy. Speak. Speak. Speak. Good boy. Jump. Jump. Good boy. Very good. What suddenly brings you here to Mumbai, Mahendra? A spur of the moment decision, brother. Look at him. - He looks like a city boy now. - Yes. You are looking good, brother. - He looks like a hero. - Right. You too can look like one. It doesn't take long. Yes, but how? What's the scene of Mumbai? I heard everyone here speaks in English? True. So did you learn English? English? I know only a little, just to get me through. I've hired a staff to speak English on my behalf. - Bala? - Sir. Go for it. It's an honour for me to be working for such a great and kind personality as Mr. Karan Singh. I shall forever be indebted for this opportunity. Interestingly, it's very rare to meet such a humble person who has a heart of gold.. That's enough. Stop, stop, stop. Thank you. Thank you. Jugnu? What is the name of your heroine? - What is it? - I'll tell you, he's asking. Alia? Alia Bhatt? A party? Who will attend our party? This is Mumbai, sir. People don't respect you until you show some money. Hmm. It will cost you, but you should throw a big party. When your photos will be published on the newspaper on page 3 the next day, people will know who you are. This isn't about me. All this is for Jugnu. Here you go. Mahendra, so much cash? Doesn't matter. Tell me, will Alia attend the party? There is no way she wouldn't come for this kind of money. She will surely come. If you want, I can invite a couple of more heroines. Bala, throw us a party then. We too would like to see how Mumbai parties! Jugnu! Jugnu, Brother has set everything! We are throwing a very big party. No one can throw us out now. We are bosses now. Your photo will be published in the newspaper. - This big! - Yes. Come on in! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up, man! - We'll party! Come on, guys! - A party? Here. Take this and smile. Go, take it for a spin. Stupid boy. Hello? Hello, I... I am in Mumbai. I thought I should call and inform you. You know... the sea's right in front of me. Have you ever seen the sea? Mahendra? Hello? Mahendra? You and Jaibeer helped a Jat girl elope and marry? That too to a boy from another caste? Mr. Chaudhary, that girl loved that boy. I don't believe caste is greater than love. Don't tell anyone that you are about to marry into my family. I am returning your ring. Oh no, no one came. Why are all of you standing in a line? This is your party. Go to the bar and order a drink. Ask the DJ to play some music. Feel free to roam around. Yes, he is right. Go, do your thing. - Go on. - Go spread out. Go on. Go on, go on, go on. Listen? Where is she? - Kiran? Come here. - Yes, sir. Did you have any drinks? Kiran, did you offer them any drinks? Do you wish to have drinks now or later, sir? Kiran, what is our national language? - Hindi, sir. - So let's stick to Hindi, okay? Sure, sir. Would you like to have drinks now or later? Get them, dear. Get them now. Come with me. You can take us wherever you want, dear. Let's go. - Bala? - Yes, sir? No one has showed up as yet? - Do you think they will show up? - It's just 9 o'clock, sir. - Is that too early? - This is Mumbai, sir. Even 12 o'clock is too early, sir. - Mahendra. - Hi. How are you? I am good. So tell me, liked the arrangement? Nice place you have got here. But when will our guests show up? And what about Alia? Yes. - Yes? - Hmm. Is this Jugnu's party? He's Mahendra Singh Sheoran, from Haryana. Very big man. I'll be right back. Jugnu! You saw how many people showed up. I don't understand this place, Mumbai. You wanted people like them around you, right? They are here for you, come on now give me a smile. - Wow! - Jugnu! Jugnu! Brother did it! Look at that! Now everyone will know who you are, bro! Jugnu, I am your favourite, right? Jugnu? Jugnu? Come, come. You're looking so handsome. - Mr. Ashok? - Yes, sir? Come here. Girls! Girls! Girls! Look who's here! This is Jugnu. Hi, Jugnu! - He's new in town. It's his party. - what a lovely name Jugnu! - Hi, Jugnu. - Come, come. Mr. Ashok, where are you? Come, let's click a picture. - Come, come. Come in, come in. - Please come together. - A little closer. Come, come. - Smile, please. Click a picture for page 3. Come on girls, smile for page 3! Come on, yeah. Hello? Yes, what? Okay, I'm coming. Give me a minute, I am coming. - Hi, Jugnu! - Look here, look here. "But don't get deceived here." "The same sun and stars shine here." "But you should only love your shadow." "Why are you sitting here?" "You have to give a reason to sit too." "Otherwise, you move on," "And give someone else the opportunity." "Otherwise, you move on," "And give someone else the opportunity." "You are not the only one," "Everyone in this crowd is alone." "God has destined you to have some such moments here." "There is a shadow that overcasts everything." "What is this shadow?" "This is nothing but an illusion." "Just an illusion." "Why are you so scared?" "I had heard that you are the one who created this world." "So many innocent lives got ensnared into this trap." "Yes, you should keep an eye on this path." "You will keep losing things at every corner." "You are unique." "Your love is unique." "You will get everything here but you will never get peace here." "Run away, " "Don't you ever turn around and look back here." "This is nothing but an illusion." "Just an illusion." "This is nothing but an illusion." "Just an illusion." Jugnu? What are you doing out here? What happened? Did you not like the party? This is just the first party. We will have even bigger parties. No, brother, it's not that. No, what? Stupid, do you know who is going to be here? Your Alia! Karan Singh had a word with her. - Alia is coming here? - Hmm. - Karan Singh spoke to her? - Yes. - Let's go. - Yes, let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. Brother Karan Singh? By what time will Alia come? She will come. No, you spoke to her, right? When is she coming? I am sure she must have told you. She will come. If not her then someone else will come. Do you want me to get someone better than her? Tell me, should I? Jugnu! You! I am a fool. You can fool me. But why are you fooling my innocent brother? Huh? No heroine comes just like that. You can't just offer money and... Bloody villagers just come to the city and... You too, Karan Singh? It's just... - Get out of here! - Jugnu! - Listen to me, Jugnu. - Get out! Get out! This is not right! - Jugnu! - Everyone leave! - Jugnu! - Sir! Hey you, stop the music! Stop the music! Calm down. Come here, son. Listen... Come on, everyone... Party's over. Bye. Please leave. What are you doing? Everyone's staring at you. Who are they, brother? Who are they? Who are all of them? I should be afraid of them? These shameless people? - Hey, who are you? - Jugnu! - Is this your father's wedding party? - Jugnu! Get out of here. - Jugnu! - Get out! Hey, have you gone mad? You can't do this. Excuse me, do you know me? Do you know me? You don't right? Party's over, please leave. - Go, madam! - What is wrong? Everyone, leave! Party's over. Please leave! What is wrong, Jugnu? What is wrong? - Get out! - Shameless fellow! - He pushed me! - You heard the guy. Come on, everyone. Come on everyone, get out. You pushed a girl. Just leave, come on. Don't you have any shame? This way, come on. get out. Now you slap me. You should have slapped me the day I told you that I want to marry Alia. Then I wouldn't have to go through all this mess. I am feeling suffocated from the time I came here. I haven't laughed even once. I always keep thinking what will people be thinking about me. I can't think of anything on my own. Who do I want be a hero in front of anyway? These fake people? Who are even ashamed to speak their own language? My little brother, you will come across different kind of people everywhere. For us, they seem fake. For them, we are village bumpkins. I am okay being a village bumpkin, brother. I don't want to be fake. I asked you to get me married to Alia. And you are worse than me. You sent me here. And then followed me here. Brother... Brother, please take me away from here. I'll die, brother. Take me away. Take me back to our village, brother. I want to laugh, brother. I want to laugh freely. Then tell me, what do we do about Alia? I am just a fan of hers, brother. There are many like me. I had gone blind. I have realised my mistake. Bimla was right. She said Jugnu will return back smarter. Sister-in-law said that about me? Huh? Hmm. Party's over, dude. What do we do now? No brother, all our people are still here. How can you say that party's over? Fauji, set the mood. Right away. "Our Jugnu's got smarter." "Our Jugnu's got smarter." "We have turned Mumbai into Haryana." "We have!" "Our Jugnu's got smarter." Keep all the bags inside. - Why do you need to keep them separately? - Jugnu? - We are all going to the same place anyway. - Look at this. Huh? Did you send Jugnu's new car? I sent it in the morning itself. Brother, they published my picture in the newspaper. Well done, Bala. - You kept your promise. - Yes, brother. Tell me if you need more money. No, brother. You've already given a lot. Come to Haryana. You'll get a grand welcome. Greetings. We'll get going. We are getting late. - Mr. Bala... - Rohtas? You sit at the back. Who has the tickets, Fauji? This is a letter... Can you give it to Alia? Yes, of course. She'll be happy to read it. Let's go, Jugnu. Get in, Jugnu. Bye. - Drive. - Let's go, let's go. Ms. Alia, my name is Jugnu.' 'I came all the way from Haryana to meet you.' And I got an experience of a lifetime.' It's a long story.' Let's keep it for some other time.' But let me tell you something.' 'In the movies, when the hero falls in love with you,' 'not just he but all of us too fall in love with you.' Because you are very beautiful.' Mumbai... is a nice place.' But I am better off in Haryana.' 'If you ever come to Haryana, make sure to visit me.' I'll introduce you to everyone.' My address's mentioned below.' Jugnu.' Propagation doesn't help, brother. - You have to work hard. - I'm leaving. - Make sure voting takes place smoothly. - Okay. - You are right. - Go, cast your vote. - He crossed all limits this time. - Greetings. Greetings, Mahendra. You should start preparing for the next election. Look at him. Forget him. Listen, we three need to get our horoscope read by an expert. Our love lives are a mess. Brother, what I had wasn't love. I still can't believe that you went to Mumbai. I can do anything for my brothers. Come here. Come on, give me a smile. A bunch of idiots. How much time's left, Fauji? - I think only half an hour more. - We have done our job. Yes, God will handle the rest. I just hope our security deposit isn't seized, brother. You always say the worst things. Stop it! It is a possibility. I have been noticing for quite some days now. You keep blabbering nonsense. - Go, go, go. - Grab him, grab him, grab him. Uncle! Catch him from behind. Stop, stop. Take a break. Election's result is out. Huh? - Security deposit got seized. - Damn it! Oh no! You idiots, Chetram's security deposit was seized! We won the election! How did this miracle take place? You were bound to win. You know your girl, Bimla? She is responsible for it. She spoke to all the women and canvassed for you. You know what she said? "There never was and there never will be a man like him in the whole of Haryana." Hats off to you, auntie. I agree! Mahendra? Bimla helped you win the election. All by herself. That's what you call woman power. Bimla did a great thing. Fauji, quickly give me the jeep keys. Hurry. We won! We won! Chetram lost! "Your intoxicating eyes..." For the first time, a man stood up to support a woman's right. He got her married to the boy she wanted to. He went against the community and did it. He didn't even think how it would affect the election. If you vote against such a man, you are voting against yourself. Have you ever come across such a man? Huh? He is the man I am talking about. You have to vote for him. "Your intoxicating eyes..." - Right. - Is Bimla at home? No, she's sitting on the swing over there. Bye, brother-in-law. So, who did you vote for? The one who deserved it. Do you like the one who deserved it? Why won't I like the one who deserves it? Listen, I don't understand. It's okay. The one you like... do you also love... Anyone would love you. You are so lovable. Huh? "This bride has found her groom." "She is on cloud nine now." But what about Father? He called it off. To hell with him. You were the one who didn't seem interested. Go home, I'm coming to marry you. Go! "This bride has found her groom." "She is on cloud nine now." "Listen up, bro." "Action." - "Listen up, bro." - "What is it, dude?" "Listen up, bro." "Let's get this straight." "Don't be mistaken." "I love this land." "The address you seek..." "This place is known as..." "Tell me already." - "This place is known as..." - "What is it known as?" "This place is known as... Haryana." "This place is known as... Haryana." "Haryana." Meet my friend, Nepal Singh. Japan Singh. Nepal Singh. "This place is known as Haryana." What's wrong? Forgot to carry money. Stop! "This place is known as..." "Tell me already." "This place is known as... Haryana." - "This place is known as Haryana. - Haryana!" Nothing needs to change. We'll take it from here. I said change. No problem. Never sent him till Hisar. Never sent him till Hisar. Oh God, Fauji! "We were sitting and doing nothing." "Then we stood up." "But we are still not doing anything." "We have sown the seeds and set the water flowing." "Now we need to visit the bar." "This place is known as..." "Tell me already." "This place is known as..." "What is it known as?" "This place is known as... Haryana." - I know. Listen, listen, listen. Yes tell brother. "Four play cards." "Forty sit around doing nothing at all." "They keep laughing." "They just keep laughing." "They crack jokes, they gossip and they smoke hookah all day." "This place is known as..." "What is it known as?" "This place is known as Haryana." "Haryana!" "Haryana!" See how he's going like a thief.. Sorry, sorry I'll take it from here.. "This place is known as Haryana." One more. And..its a WRAP. "Haryana!" "Haryana!" "Haryana!" "Haryana!" "This is top class." "Totally satisfied."
