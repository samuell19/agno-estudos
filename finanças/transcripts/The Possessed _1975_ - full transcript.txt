(epic music) (alarm wailing) (clanking) (clanking) (clanking) (creepy ambient music) [Barnes] You surprised me, Father. You're the last person I would imagine to dramatize a petty theft. Of course, the sacrilege is an unpleasant matter for you. [Juan] But how do you explain the fact that they left some solid gold candles next to the chalice of much value? [Barnes] The thief or thieves were in too much of a hurry or perhaps, in the darkness, they failed to notice them. And how about the candle placed at the devil? Obviously, a blasphemous challenge. These things are quite common in cases of breaking and entering. They're almost like the thief's signature. Some sort of just put it down to the nervous tension they're under at the time. In this case, the important thing is the intention of the person who stole the chalice. The thief may believe in the presence of good and evil. Why not? Err and perversion do exist. We're surrounded by devilish businesses. Well, that's true but only on a purely human level. I can't imagine a man like you believing in black magic or the cult of the devil. The child who was kidnapped? That's going too far, Father. It was probably committed my some poor, demented, motherless woman. (sudden dark music) And this. Do you know what this signifies? Root of mandrake. I tell you, there's something devilish about this. That's just non-sense. Excuse me. Would you like to sign this, Mr. Barnes? Do you mind? Of course, not. Bring them in. The child will be found. And the chalice was probably in the hands of some unscrupulous antique dealer. We'll catch the thief, don't worry. But please don't alarm the people. Young people nowadays are bored with just sex and drugs. They're liable to turn to any strange rituals. Anything exactly... It's too easy to make that conclusion. I've a report about a gypsy woman who was supposed to be a witch. She sells love potion and stuff like that. She might just be a lead for us. I'll have her brought in for questioning. If she knows anything, I swear to you, I'll ring it out of her. My intention was to avert a greater evil. I wouldn't like to be responsible for that poor woman. Suffering uselessly at the hands of your men. You do your own job, Father and let me do mine, will you? You may think me cool or severe but thanks to my severity, we have no problems with tramps of vagrants. Daddy, I'm going to the garden with Anne. Would you give me a kiss, please? Of course. He's Father Juan. How are you? Don't bother your father, Susan. Excuse me, Mr. Barnes, I told her not to intrude. Don't worry about it. Now, go on, Susan. Go out with Anne. So long. [Anne] We'll see you later. She's a charming little girl. Yes, she is. I regret that I can't spend more time with her than I do. Since my wife died, I've been so tied up in politics, I'd have to leave her to Anne for governance. You were saying, Father? Nothing. Perhaps you're right. Maybe it's just my imagination. Well, you can't complain. The jack of gold. The spades, I don't like too much. More spades. Now, a great fine gentleman. This is what's waiting for you. Hey you two, search the ground. You, come with me. That child's gotta be around here somewhere. I've got a search warrant and an order for your arrest from the police commissioner. [Gautiere] What do want? We just have a few questions we like to ask you, that's all. Don't touch me! Terrible things will happen to you. My master will protect me. Pig! Come on. Let's go. The police commissioner will pay for this! I swear it! I'll put a curse on all of them! A curse on all of them! For the last time. Tell us, it was you who kidnapped the poor child. There were several witnesses who saw you loitering near the house. Now where's the child? You'll never find out. Right, I have somebody here that might have something to say about this matter. Tell her to come in. Hm? Oh, sorry, chief. Would you come in, please? Now this. I gave you charity, don't you recall? A few bits of dried bread. That's all. It's all I could spare at the time, I swear it. Now tell me that you know where my son is. What about your son? He's my only child, lady. I can't have more children. It could be that you are a mother too. Shut up, you stupid bitch! Please, won't you? If you know where he is, please tell me. He's so small, I. (Gautiere chuckles) Answer, you witch! Don't you have any feelings? No, please don't shout at her. I know she'll tell me. I'll ask her on my knees if I have to. She'll give me back my son. Lady, tell me, for the love of god. Don't call me your lady and don't invoke your god. I know you know where he is. I know it. Give him back to me. I'll give you everything I possess. I'll sell everything I own. I'll give you anything you ask. But please, give me back my son. You'll never see him again. He'll be sacrificed to the great master. I'll give you everything! Everything! Why don't you stop your whining? But please, give me back my son. Get up! Please, give me back my son! You're crazy. I believe you're capable of sacrificing a child but we have ways of making you talk. You can believe that. Torture? I can stand it. The great master give me strength. There are other ways. I don't think your magic powers would resist an injection of sodium pentathol. Do you know what that is? It's a truth serum. That's what. I'll never talk. Your influential friend won't be able to help you when a chemical product has taken away your willpower. Ascator! (groaning) Hi there. - Hello. - Is your teddy bear better? He got a fever but he'll be better. Give him him some cognac oil. It'll do him good. [Susan] Ugh. - Hello. - Hello, honey. How are you? Fine. You're late again. Snowed under with work on the table. Oh, we never have any time together. You're right. How about dinner time? I've heard that story before. I know who you are, Susan. You're a very pretty little girl. Did I scare you? My daddy says I shouldn't speak to strangers. It'd best if you go away. He says it's dangerous. And takeaway the present I brought for you? I don't know you. I've got a beautiful little doll for you. His name Ascator. Okay, let me see it. (brooding ambient music) He wants to be your friend. But it's our secret. I'll give him to you if you promise to hide him and not show him to anyone. Are you serious? He's yours. Swear that you won't show it to anyone. Swear it to me. I swear it. You can only play with him when you're alone in your room. We'll hide him in here. This is Ascator's necklace. Only his friends have unlocked it. If anyone asks, tell them you've found it. Don't let it anyone take it away from him. And don't forget, it's our secret. Come on now, honey. Now, you don't gonna believe that. Now do you? I know you're only kidding. I wanna go home. Did you get tired of painting? I'm bored. Where did you get that horrible necklace? Don't you touch it. You're horrible. You're a pig. You let him do dirty things to you. You're both filthy dogs. (spooky piano music) (spooky choral music) (wind blowing) (phone ringing) Yeah? Anne, is Susan still up yet? No, she went to bed, oh, an hour ago. That's strange, she didn't tell me goodnight. That is strange. But you know what children are like, don't you, Barnes? She just wasn't quite herself today. Well, it's doesn't matter. Goodnight. Goodnight. (creepy ambient music) By the hurricanes! By the pestilence! By the devouring insects! Satan, hear us. Give us your power! [Witches] Give us your power! Prince of a lot of human sin! Give us your power! [Witches] Give us your power! Susan Barnes, daughter of our higher lord. In his name, I order you to violate the laws of all nature. You upset hands of luck to carry out the impossible. Susan Barnes, hatred and perversion await you, Susan. Come! Come! Come! Immediately! (groaning) (creepy ambient music) I know. Your child. Her expression shows hatred and contempt. (buzzing) Her father about it. She's had a moment of disappointment. Maybe we disgust her. Maybe that's why she seems to hate you. But don't you worry, it'll pass. It's just the age she's at. It's quite natural, I'm sure. (woman screaming) Kneel down. Renounce with all your heart's strength your god. The father, the son, and the holy ghost. Baptism and all the prayer you have ever made. I renounce those. You give completely your body and soul, all your strength and power. The devil, our master. I do so. [Gypsy] Leave the hand of god and deliver yourself to our lord and master, Lucifer. I do so. This is a princess of the old one. How do we know she's the truth. Go on, give us proof. (wind blowing) (creepy ambient music) She's Mother Gautiere. I've come back to adore our master. (baby crying) Lucifer, I acknowledge you as my master and my only price. I promise to obey thee blindly, to make evil, to spread confusion and hate. And if I fail to obey absurdly, I promise to give my life to thee, to do as you will. (baby crying) (dark ambient music) (thunder crashing) (women screaming) (birds chirping) Hey there, Susan. It's time to get up, honey. (Susan giggling) But were are you? (giggling) Here's your breakfast. It's a beautiful day outside. Bullshit! (laughing) I don't know what's wrong with her this morning. Leave us alone, will you? Yes. Yes, of course. Why are you behaving like this? You know that you can't treat Helen like that! Why don't you go fuck your boyfriend and leave me alone? We must administer justice with a firm hand. That is the only way for us to maintain the peace and tranquility we have always enjoyed in this county. I'll sign it and then I'll add something personal. Excuse me, sir. May I interrupt you? Of course, Anne. Come on in. You'd better type that up right away. I must speak to you about something urgent. Certainly, go ahead. I'm very worried about Susan. She's a delightful little girl but I should say was. [Barnes] Was? She's changed suddenly and unexplainably. She seems obsessed with, I don't know how to tell you. Are you referring to sexual matter? Yes, well, it's perverse and she uses obscene language. None of her friends could've taught her any of those words. And she's getting very violent. (children chattering) Hey, cut that out! Cut that out! I'm gonna tell my brother that, you idiots. (creepy ambient music) (girl screaming) What's the matter with her? (deep dark music) (children clamoring) [Anne] Good morning, Father. How are you? Oh, good morning, Anne. And how are you, Susan? Fine, I see you're reading news. Yes, but nothing you should worry about. I know what goes on. Susan! I know these things. Who told you? Children overhear everything. So it seems. Including these atrocities committed by some abnormal person. If I shouldn't hear about this, why don't we leave? Please, excuse her. These days, she's been impossible. Just a minute. What's wrong, Susan? What's the matter? I'll be right back. Is it true that priests can't tell lies? No, that's not possible. But priest, much less? That's true. So if I ask you a question, you'll tell me the truth, won't you? If it's possible, I certainly would. It's possible. It certainly is possible. And if you don't answer it, it's because you don't want to. Ask me the question. Do priests have the same thing as other men? What are you referring to? To sex. Who's been talking to you of these things? You must answer me. Do they have it or not? We're the same as other men. So you've all got girlfriends, haven't you? But you mustn't speak like that. You don't wanna answer. These are things you'll learn about, Susan. We have to learn to repress our desires. You as well? [Juan] Yes. Then you're either a goddamn queer or impotent! What did you say to Father Juan? Susan, answer me! That's none of your business. (mellow orchestral music) [Esther] Juan, just a second, I wanna talk to you. [Juan] They're waiting for us. - Hey, hurry up you two. - We'll be there. Just a minute. Can't we talk about it later? It has to be right now. All right, go ahead. What's wrong? Since we arrived, you're acting strange. Last time, your were completely different. You wouldn't let me out of your sight. Esther, we'll always be friends. Why didn't you answer my letter? Are you angry for some reason? No, it's not that. All my friends thought we were engaged. Another woman? No. What is it then? Forgive me, Esther. I haven't been faithful to you. You're confessing. Another woman. No, I tried to keep away from you because during this past year, my ideas have changed. You have that for reason? I want you to know, I'm becoming a priest. You? I'm entering the seminary. Are you certain? You want to do this? Yes, Esther. (gloomy music) (silently sobbing) (bell tolling) Bring along. The people of our county are afraid of lauding to the darkness. Afraid of a monster capable of destroying the body of an innocent child. This is our question. Shall we receive an answer? Signed, William Grant. This is a direct attack on the commissioner, young man. Doesn't your girlfriend work from? Yeah, but what's that got to do with it? Now, the coroner says that child was sacrificed after the old woman was arrested and died. Isn't that proof enough? William, I think you've something against Barnes. Is he one those bosses who gives up his female employees? Don't publish it if you're afraid to reprise. But don't mix girlfriend in this. [Editor] Hey, Smith. [Smith] Yeah? [Editor] One page, two columns. Right away, sir. [Editor] Put a good photo of the child's body. Yes, sir. And make sure we can see the wound. Right, sir. This is the newspaper business, son. With direct precision and dynamite. No, you've already suffered enough. It's best you don't open it. I wanna see my son for the last time. I wanna see before he's buried forever. She's got a right to open it. (screams) (woman sobbing) Who could be so diabolical to a child? We better start now. (discorded music) (screaming) (frogs croaking) (Anne screams) Helen, Helen! Come up at once! What's the matter? I don't like to be screamed at. You're not the mistress of this house. Why did you leave the windows open? With all the strange toads that come in from park. The room's full of them. (suspenseful music) Do you see this? They're all get broken because of your carelessness. What the devil's going on? (faint growling) (faint growling) Susan, open the door. Susan! Susan! Susan, did you hear what I said? (laughing) What could have happened to her to bring about this transformation? First her obscene language, then this howling and these unconceivable fits. I can understand you being alarmed but there are treatments for these abnormalities. Would you mind telling me something, doctor? What are your conclusions after talking to her? Well, it's very disconcerting, Mr. Barnes. But your daughter has an incredibly superior IQ. Susan? She always seem to be like an ordinary child. Even not very good in her studies. She spoke to me in several languages. Including Ancient Greek and also in Latin. And in another language completely unknown to me but which might well have been Sanskrit. What are you saying doctor? You're talking about Susan. Why she hasn't even been able to learn a little French. And that's not all. In what you might say a marking impertinent manner, she questioned me about theology. Higher mathematics and also about vanished cultures. I believe your daughter thought me a contemptible ignorant fool judging by her laughter. But that's impossible, doctor. She could've have possibly become gently... Come at once, doctor, the little girl. (Susan mildly growling) [Doctor] 50 milligrams of Thorazine for me. I don't want this filthy bitch stick her needles into me. It's a tranquilizer, Susan. Don't alarm your father. You mean I shouldn't frighten you! You damn fool and knows nothing! Your ties is a bunch of bullshit! Do you want me to tell you what you did this morning? You sent flowers to a Mrs. Blayton, the widow that you're trying to convince to invest in a clinic for you! Nurse, get it over with. Get the hell outta here, you bitch! You don't stick needles into me! Don't you do it! (gasps) Hey, Anne! Look what I found here! (Helen screaming) (Helen sobbing) What are you doing with the furniture? Have you gone crazy? I didn't do it. They were moving alone, Anne. What have you got there? I've never seen this. Doctor, tell me why I was invited to this meeting? You don't believe in the supernatural. But I do believe in the power of superstition. And the trauma sometimes brought on by a fanatic education. In Susan's syndrome, there's a possible religious phases. That's evident. You won't admit then that other persons or individuals are speaking through Susan? Diabolical possession? (chuckles) That belief belongs to the Dark Ages. The ages of complete fear, especially fear. Nowadays, science can find an explanation for anything. Almost everything, doctor. The power of evil is real. It emanates from Satan. But to manifest itself in these persons and simpleton. In religious literature, in the literature of all ages, the name of Satan corresponds to the vices, evil, to hatred. All completely human peculiarities. Today, when it has been scientifically proved, that an electron passes at the same time through two holes placed at each side of the same plane, everything can be accepted as natural. And how would you explain Susan's case in a natural, normal manner? Epilepsy, drugs, schizophrenia, hypnosis can produce some muscular impossible to repeat in a state of wakefulness. And her knowledge of several languages, her advanced cultural level, impossible in a child of her age. We know that genes have memory. The use of languages and knowledge in general is inherited from our forefathers, remaining hidden and appear by means of an adequate mental stimulus. It's like the impression we sometimes have of having already been in a certain place before. It maybe an inherited memory. Emerging like a dream after eons of time. Are you referring to the Anima Mundi and the platonic philosophers? Something similar. It's what Greek explains as racial memory. You're talking about my daughter. Not about the subject of an experiment. I wanna know if she's abnormal or... It's much too early to diagnose. We have discarded the possibilities of a pathological cerebral state caused by a tumor, for example. I want a neurologist to perform an electroencephalogram. Won't you allow me to consult an expert first, Mr. Barnes? On Satanism? Or perhaps maybe, an exorcist? Could you please sit down? Come now, Father. There's plenty of light on this subject. Darkness no longer frightens us. You know that all that was merely a fear of the unknown. Fear of nature, simple sickness and simple death. Your bewitched people of two centuries ago would've been cured with a good chemical tranquilizer. Don't be too sure. Can your tranquilizer return the life of that poor child who was killed? This was precisely the emotional catalyst which produced in the child a psychopathological crisis. I want you to do something, will you? Medicines or exorcisms, it's unimportant to me if she's insane or she's made a pact with the devil. I don't the either magical or logical explanations. We have to put an end to this horror. I insist on a thorough examination by a neurologist. Meanwhile, what about the child? She can go home to her toys. Live in our ambience. Her condition maybe uncomfortable but by no means dangerous. What are you doing here, Anne? This morning, we found this hidden inside a teddy bear of Susan's. I think it represents the devil. It might be a warning or some kind of curse, maybe. It's a very strange kind of toy. A lot of strange things are going on in that house. Excuse me, ma'am. Could you direct me to the house of the three sisters? That one. That one on the corner. Thank you. Hey, you're not going over there, are you? Yes, seems they need me urgently. What it was? He hasn't got a bit of good reputation. If they need me, I go. Do whatever you like, I warned you. Thank you all the same. Good morning, I'm Father Juan. You called me. Yes, come in, please. I didn't know she was Catholic. She never told me. But she insisted I call you. She's an awful good girl. First she married Ed, and then gets a divorce then she starts mating with whoever comes down the highway. You must know those things are. I do. Is the girl badly ill? I suppose so. Last night, she drank a whole bottle of gin and since, she don't eat anything. You have to believe me, she's never done this before. Would you like to pass through? Thank you. (knocking on door) Hi, I've been told that you needed me. (gloomy music) You didn't expect to see me, didn't you now? (laughs) Especially you. I hesitated about calling you. It hurt me to do it, I assure you. But I had to see you. And you, to see me like this. What do want with me? I want you to contemplate what you've done. And yet, you can't forget that I'm the same young woman that you once loved. You remember this? It was a present from you when we first met. I was young then and fresh and filled with illusions. You know what I am now? A cheap whore, that's what. A whore hole sell us all for a couple of fucks. Take a good look at me. Lift your eyes and look. Have the courage to look at what you've made out of me! You can't blame me for it. You have chosen your own path. Did I have an option? You abandoned me without any thought of what could happen to me. It was my vocation, Esther. What about me? Have you ever thought that you broke off my life? No! You're safe and sound. Your church protects you. Until now, because in the future, you'll have my life a baggage on your conscience. And when I laid some delicious pig, I'll think that I'm laying the blame, the blame on your shoulders, buster! And that'll be my revenge! That's what! I'd like to make you change mind. But it's you who has to repent. There's still time. Time to change. Change your way of life. Have you forgiven me? Yes, Esther. Oh, leave the priesthood and let's go away together! I'll do whatever you want me to do. No other woman can love you like I do. That's not the kind of love I feel for you. Don't abandon me again, whatever you do. You'll never understand me, Esther. Yes, of course, I understand! You're nothing but a selfish hypocrite, that what! You destroyed me and you haven't got the slightest compassion to me in this condition. Esther, I want... Please, go. I told you to get out, didn't I? Thanks for coming here, Mr. Grant. We'll overlook your yellow journalism. All that matters to me is my daughter. I understand completely. Where did you get the idea that Susan's illness might be a kind of revenge? Hmm, it seems like a reply to the severity with which you administer justice. You had that old woman arrested. All these mysterious phenomenon began after her death. Witchcraft? Do you believe in it? Of course, I don't believe in it. But somebody might have given Susan some kind of drug. I'm afraid it's not only my daughter's health but also her life that might be in danger. Don't exaggerate. Grant let's his imagination run wild. I wanna ask you if we might forget our differences. Let's make kind of truce. Don't publish anything which might harm my daughter. All right, I won't, sir. But only for Susan. Thank you. Besides medical treatment, what else do you think we might do? Intensify the police investigation. Somebody's got access to Susan. You should have your house watched and your telephone tapped. Telephone as well? Yes, someone's influencing her by means of messages. You could be right. I better have the house watched. That is if I get authorization from the commissioner. Do it now. Consider it done. What's that pig doing down here? Why's he watching me? Your father's worried about you, Susan. The only thing that matters to him is his political career. Not other things you know all about. Don't talk like that about him. Your father's a fine man. I suppose you should know about that since you're sleeping with him. Susan! Don't pretend. I heard you both talking in his office. Don't you get enough with your newspaper reporter? Bunch of pigs! I'm not taking you to the park today. What are you doing with that rubbish around your neck? I told you to throw it away! I'm getting tired with you, you whore. Oh, Susan, let me go. (dark ambient music) Good evening, miss. [Anne] Oh, good evening. How are you? I'll be here all night. (dark ambient music) (phone ringing) Hello? I'd like to speak to Will Grant. Who's calling, please? Tell him, it's Anne Crawford. Just a moment, I'll call him for the phone. Bill, hey Bill. It's your love. Hi, honey. Sorry, to bother you. I have to see you right away, darling. It's very important. Right now? But Anne, I'm snowed under with work! Forget the newspaper for once in your life. I'm in danger. I can't come into your office. We shouldn't be seen together. If you really love me, go the park with the next half hour. I'll be waiting for you next to the statue. Don't forget I love you so. Anne? Anne? (choral church music) (choral church music) (choral church music) Pardon me, Father. I didn't want to interrupt you. I went to your house and they told me you were still at the church. I'd like to speak to you. (distant choral church music) Sit down. Well, would you like to start? You all have a reputation. We? To whom are you referring? Catholic priests. I've read that you all have facilities for exorcizing. First, it's necessary to be possessed by a demon. I think Susan Barnes is in this case. I firmly believe it. What reasons you have to make such an accusation? I've seen furniture moving furniture moving around on it's own. And I've experienced terrible cold in well-heated room. And I've smell repulsive orders. And above all, I've listened to somebody, somebody, obscene and evil. And I've awful seen malignant eyes in the back of the child's eyes. Yes, Father, I believe she's possessed. Those who are not believers accept such a fact. And I have many doubts. Our church only accepts possession in truly confirmed cases. What proof do you need, Father? Science must firs exhaust all its resources. Prove that's not hysteria, schizophrenia, or even pretense. In other words, arrive at the certain conclusion that the phenomena go past natural limits. I'm not hysterical. And I have no absolutely interest in pretending. I tell you, I'm certain I've witnessed supernatural phenomena. You have to do something, Father. We must first exhaust everything, Anne. I'm referring to the official sciences. And then obtain a special permission from my superiors. But I must warn you that not all priest capable of being exorcist. One needs experience in exorcism and complete authority. (spooky choral music) (screams) (grunting) (discorded ambient music) (bird hooting) You've come, my love That's Anne's voice. Oh, my god. How's that possible that you? Don't ask me questions. The important thing is we're alone together. We're going to love each other. (grunting) Let me go! Kiss me, my love. You love me! Willy, you want to or not? You will be mine! (grunting) (thudding) I knew you'd finally give in. Kiss me, my love. I said kiss me! Pig! You kissed Anne. You're well-hung. Oh, what good are they to you now? (creepy ambient music) I would say that this crime looks like the work of a sex maniac, Father. Similar to the death of the child and the desecration of the church when they stole the chalice. If they're related, we better start thinking in terms of a dangerous madman or in something more calculated. No, that old gypsy allowed herself to die. She wasn't a victim of a madman. I think this is a clear case of Satanism. Don't try to obey the truth with fantasy, Father Juan. This young man had accused the authority of inefficiency. Used by even determine. And that's the reason he died. The killer is inventive and has added a macabre detail to distract our attention. William Grant died for calling things by their proper name. My newspaper would be used to denounce the authorities daily. If they continue their policy, I mean action. The police does what it can. The very lack of logic makes the matter more difficult because if he... Somebody's being covered for, Mr. Barnes. Not a single arrest. I'll uncover it. Don't you worry! (creepy ambient music) [Anne] Hello, I'd like to speak to Will Grant. [Secretary] Who's calling, please? [Anne] Tell him it's Anne Crawford. [Secretary] Just a moment, I'll call him to the phone. Bill, hey, Bill. It's your love. Was that the conversation? Do you recognize the voices? Exactly. I didn't know we were being recorded. Okay, here's a transcription of the conversation. Check it over, please. Exactly. Would you please sign it? Thank you very much. We're through for today. But we'll need you as a witness at the trial. I'm at your disposal. I'll do whatever I can. Thank you once again. Bring in the other woman. Would you come in, miss? Sit down, would you? [William] Hi, honey. [Anne] Sorry, to bother you. I have to see you right away, darling. It's very important. [William] Right now? But Anne, I'm snowed under with work! [Anne] Forget the newspaper for once in your life. I'm in danger. I can't come into your office. We shouldn't be seen together. If you really love me, go the park with the next half hour. I'll be waiting for you next to the statue. Don't forget I love you so. [William] Anne? Do you recognize your voice? I don't know. I don't understand this. I didn't speak to William. I said none of those things. Hm, that attitude will get you nowhere. Anyone would swear that that's your voice. Listen, Ms. Crawford. You're better off to accept then sign your statement. You phoned your fiance of don't you recognize his voice? Yes, it's his voice, all right and the woman's voice is perhaps similar to mine. I don't know what my own voice sounds like. But I'm telling you, I didn't call William last night. [Morrison] You think someone impersonated your voice? It's possible. I hope that I prove it though. Uh, you said that you're in the Catholic church at that time and yet, you're not of the Catholic faith. Can you explain that? I wanted to speak to Father Juan. [Morrison] At that time of night? It's was an urgent matter. Would you tell me about it? It was about Susan. She's the daughter of the police commissioner. What could be so wrong with a child that you'd wanna visit a priest at that time of the night? I think, I think she's bewitched. What? Well, let's leave that for the moment. You were with the priest for 15 minutes. Now, what did you do afterwards? I already told you. I stopped in the garden. For what? To think about things. It's all so confusing. Ah yes, so I see. When you entered the garden later, was the policeman still there? No, I only saw the policeman when I left. What's here is clear enough. I think it's your voice. And the experts we consult will think so too. Now let's this get over with once and for all. You phoned your fiance, yes or no? I didn't call him! I didn't see William last night. I swear it! I have a gift for you. Susan, what are you doing here? Oh, what's this you brought me? I like it very much. I know you'll like it. My little girl. Who let this little girl in here? [Police] She's the daughter of Commissioner Barnes. I don't care if she's the daughter of the secretary of the treasury. That imbecile at the door just let her walk right in here. Come on, little girl. Come with me. I'll be going. I've got a lot of things to do. So long. Goodbye, my dear. Be a good girl. Don't give your father any trouble while I'm out of the house, huh. Wait a minute! What did you say your name was? Susan. How many times do I have to tell you? What you say we play a little game called what do you think? I don't have time for things like that. I'll ask you questions and you'll give me quick answers. Would you like that? You wanna interrogate me, eh. Uh, well, yes. Something like that. Shall we play? Better not waste my time. What do you wanna know? That dark stain there on your pocket. What is it? Oh, stain. Can't you see it's blood? I am Police Chief Morrison. The stupidest man in the whole damn county. Hey, that's my voice. (Anne screaming) What? What's wrong? (dark ambient music) Don't drink anymore, Mr. Barnes. It won't help matters. Better keep your mind alert. We're facing an enemy that's powerful and cruel. You still believe all of this is a work of the devil? Now, more than ever. Susan could never have done such monstrous thing to poor old Will. It's absurd. She's been kidnapped. I'm sure of it. Where could she be? What are the police doing? They'll find her. Don't lament yourself. Give your men time. Meanwhile, what's happening to her? Pardon, sir. A servant gave me this ring to deliver to Father Juan. It was given to her by a young woman who died this morning. Do you remember this? (melancholic music) By the ring of summon. Mother Gautiere, I invoke you to come and to help me tonight. Mother Gautiere, present yourself. Present yourself. (spooky ambient music) Mother Gautiere. My name is Susan. No! You are the princess of the old wonders. I'm the daughter of Police Commissioner Barnes. You are Mother Gautiere. I will be when it's necessary. Why have you called me? A sacrifice must be made. The sisters want a meeting. They'll have it. [Gypsy] We need a child who is not yet been baptized. That's not your job. You simply call the sisters to a meeting. When for? For tonight at midnight, within an hour. I shall do as you order. (doorbell buzzing) Well, hello, Susan. But I thought you were... Where's my aunt? [Aunt] Who is it? It's me, Susan. Susan. At this time of night? Are you all right? Fine, I never felt better, why? Everybody's looking for you. Your father is very upset. How's my little cousin? Fine. But tell me, what happened to you? Has he been baptized yet? No, he hasn't been baptized yet. You know, what a fright you gave us. Why did you run away? May I see him? Of course. Of course, you can see him. Go on in to the nursery. But don't make any noise. I don't want him to wake up. I wish your Uncle John was here. He would know what to do. He would've been with your father but you know he never misses a reunion with his old students. And he's a three-hour drive away. Call daddy, he's worried about me. Yes, of course. I guess I should call right away. What do you wasting so much time for? I'll call right now. I'm so confused. So many horrible things are happening. Yes, she's here now. Don't be long. Susan, don't play tricks now. (discorded music) Oh my god! He's gone! Susan! Susan! Susan! (discorded music) Hurry up, please! I must speak to Commissioner Barnes. Please, hurry up! [Barnes] You shouldn't come along. You've been through enough today. [Juan] He's right, you get some rest. [Anne] I must see Susan. Don't you understand? I can't stay here. [Juan] It's very likely that Susan knows nothing about it. [Barnes] If it upsets you stay here alone, you better come. Hey, you men! Don't follow us. You take the southern route. (dark ambient music) Lord and master, Lucifer. I recognize you as my powerful master and prince. And I promise to serve you and obey you as long as I live. To do evil, to spread confusion and hatred! [Morrison] Hold it! You're all under arrest! (women panicking and shrieking) Susan! (gunshots bang) (grunting) (grunting) (groaning) (fast-paced discorded music) (baby crying) Susan, stop! Susan, in the name of God! (hissing) (wind howling) (baby crying) Susan! (growling) I am going to die, you perverted pastor! (grunting) (growling) Take that away! Fight on your own, you coward! Don't hide behind that! Show your face! Vade retro Satan! Go back to the hell you deserve! You can't forget that I'm the one you once loved. I was young and fresh. I had illusion. No. You're not Esther. You don't deceive me. When I died, I came to our Mother Gautiere. Don't throw me out. You always hurt your Esther. Leave me alone, go. You're my only love. You know that. I beg you. For all the awful things you did to me. Go away and leave me alone. (mellow music) No, you're not Esther. You're the spirit of Satan. You're simply trying to confuse me! Vade retro Satan! Vade retro! (Susan screaming) (screaming) (sobbing) (mellow eerie music) She's left now. I'm free. She'll let me die in peace. (sobbing) (light mellow music) (deep orchestral music)
