Whoa, whoa! This place gives me the juicebumps. Maybe we should go back. - Very back! - No! We can't go back now, you guys. Okey-Dokey Jones never goes back! Hang on to your diapies, babies. We're going in. That's Tommy Pickles. He's the bravest baby I ever knowed. And that's Phil and Lil. Well, they like worms. And I'm Chuckie. Ah, I'm not so brave. But that's okay, 'cause I got Tommy, and he's my bestest friend. Watch out! - Guys, keep moving! - It's right behind us! Tommy! Help me. Come on, Chuckie! Tommy. You kids shouldn't be playing in here. We thought the fun times would last forever. But we was wrong. Oh, my. - Upsy-daisy, Deed. - Thanks. Thank you for inviting me to your baby shower, Mrs. Pickles. Glad you could be here, Susie. - What a pretty party dress, Angelica. - Thank you. My mommy's assistant bought it especially for my aunt Didi's party. Don't say a word. All right, I got $20 on eight pounds, six ounces. - Eight pounds six. Who's got eight-seven? - I'm in for 12. Twelve pounds? What are you, crazy? Gosh, you can hardly tell she's gained any weight. Oh, don't worry. I mean, you know, from behind. There you are, Didala. Come. Look what we got for you. Boris, move your tuchus. A goat? Oh, Mom, you shouldn't have. Nothing better for the little bubbale than goat's milk. Except maybe yak. But you try finding good yak these days. He's saying, "Hello." Here you go, kinderlach, some chocolate coins. Teething on everything, I... Oh! - Aren't you gonna eat it, Tommy? - Nope. I'm saving it for my baby sister. - Oh, you mean, she finally came? - Not yet. But they're giving her this big party, so I'm pretty sure today's the day. Do you think she got losted on her way to the party? I don't know. Maybe we better go look for her. Come on. But, Tommy, she could be anywheres. - Watch it, pups. - Careful. I'll get back to you, Jonathan. I've got to say hi to the life of the party. How's our little man? I told you, Charlotte, Dr. Lipschitz says it's a girl. That windbag thought Phil and Lil were intestinal gas. Face it, Dolly. Riding high, it's a guy. Well, you know what they say, "Born under Venus, look for a--" Hello? Now, now, Dr. Lipschitz is the expert. I don't see any of you with a PhD in Latin. Yeah, pig Latin maybe. Well, let's just hope for Tommy's sake it's a girl. I'd hate to think how much my pups would be squabbling if they were both boys. Uh-uh-uh! Let's not do any gender stereotyping. After all, Stu and Drew are brothers, and they get along just fine. - Pushy! Bossy! - Lazy! Inconsiderate! - Nosy! Busybody. - Good-for-nothing! Why can't you listen to me? We're talking about a real job, Stu, with benefits. I'm not gonna waste my life as a clock-punching, paper-pushing, bean-counting... Oh, no offense. You barely make ends meet now. You've got no insurance, no savings, and another kid on the way. For your information, bro, I am working on something right now that is going to put this branch of the Pickles family on easy street. - What is it this time, an electric sponge? - Of course not! That was last year. This... This is the Reptar Wagon. The ultimate in toddler transportation. The perfect children's toy! In my day, we had plenty of fun just throwing rocks at each other. Big bag of dirt clods, that's what the kids want. The Reptar Corporation is holding a toy design contest, - and the winner gets $500! - Ooh! And there'll be plenty more if this toy's a hit, and I'll be famous. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what you said when you built that stupid thing. Maybe Dactar was a little bit complex, but this... this... Watch! I am Reptar. Hear me roar. I am Reptar! Hear me roar! Conflabbit! Can't a man work in his own basement without getting barbecued? Okay, so maybe real fire isn't the best idea for a children's toy. Tommy, somebody's been coloring your room. Yep, it's for my new sister. How are we gonna find her, Tommy? Yeah, we don't even know what she looks like. Well, she's a girl like me, so we know she'll be prettiful. Oh, brother! You dumb babies got a lot to learn about the facts of lice. Now, get out of my way. I gotta get back to the dessert table before the grown-ups get all the good stuff. Angelica, can you help us find my baby sister? I wouldn't be in such a big hurry if I was you, Tommy. 'Cause when the new baby gets here, she's gonna get all the toys and the love and the attention. And your mommy and daddy will forget all about you. It'll be like, "Look, Deed. There's that little bald kid in the house again." My mommy and daddy won't forget me. That's what Spike said before you were born. Back when his name was Paul. - Paul? - Yeah. But then you came along, and they put him out in the rain, and he turned into a dog. That's not gonna happen to me, Angelica. My mommy and daddy will love me no matter what. ♪ A baby is really neat ♪ ♪ A baby is a special treat ♪ Who does Susie Carmichael think she is? ♪ A baby has a tiny nose ♪ ♪ A baby is a little dickens ♪ ♪ A baby is a cuddly chicken ♪ ♪ A baby is lots of joy ♪ ♪ A baby will get all the toys ♪ What are you doing? ♪ A baby has a smiley face ♪ ♪ A baby is from outside space ♪ - Angelica. - Susie. ♪ A baby is extra fancy ♪ ♪ A baby poops in its pantsies ♪ - Cut it out! - No! ♪ Like a birdie singing in a tree ♪ ♪ More like Reptar screaming in your ear ♪ ♪ A baby is a gift ♪ ♪ A gift from a Bob ♪ ♪ A baby is a gift ♪ ♪ From a Bob, Bob, Bob ♪ ♪ A baby is a gift ♪ ♪ A gift from a Bob... ♪ Tommy, do you really think babies are a gift from a Bob?

Lipschitz Center for Holistic Birthing, offering the modern parent the state of the art in primitive birth alternatives. Oh! Mrs. Pickles. You weren't due till next week, now, dear. Geez, well, I guess we could try and squeeze you in somewhere. But Dr. Lipschitz promised us the all-natural Zen experience in the Tibetan terrace room. In my day, a woman just dropped her baby in the potato field and kept going. Ah! Yes, the old country room. Do you have anything a little cleaner? Well, we could try the aquatic immersion room. She's having a baby, not a gefilte fish. Oh! Stu, Didi, Randy called to say you were on your way. I didn't realize you were bringing the whole party. How far apart are the pains, hon? Oh, they're pretty much constant. Okay, Didi, let's go and get you settled in, huh? Here you go, sprout. Don't worry, sweetie, Mommy's going to be okay. Oh, gosh, Tommy, your mommy sure seems upset.

Hello, my wonderful, sweet baby boy. Well, I guess we won't be naming him after my mother. He doesn't look much like a Trixie. What about my cousin Dylan? Dylan Prescott Pickles. - Hmm. - Dil Pickles. Yeah, I like it. Here you go, sprout. Tommy, I want you to meet someone very special. This is your brother Dylan. Dil, this is Tommy. Baby. See? They already love each other. Well, that's a start. Deed, what are we gonna do? He hasn't stopped crying since we brought him home. Somehow it's not as much fun around here anymore. Yeah. What's your brother so sad about? I don't know. But whatever it is, it must be really bad. - Maybe he's broked! - What? - Broked! - Broked! Broked? He's not broked. He's a... Just a little loud! Oh! That baby's getting on my nerves. Direct from Moscow, the Banana Brothers Monkey Circus. Featuring the most amazing monkey since Brezhnev!

Serge, you stay here and watch monkeys, I get us coffee. No, Igor, you stay and watch monkeys, and I get us coffee. Nyet! Monkeys, watch you. I get coffee! I think coffee's better in St. Petersburg. Nyet, is better in Kiev. No, it's better in St. Petersburg. Nothing is better in St. Petersburg. Look! The train! Let me out! Stop! "And then the wizard looked down at the little boy and said, 'Your wish has been granted.' And the little boy looked..." Deed! Help. I'll be back, sweetie. All I did was cough, Deed. I tried not to, but I had a feeling in my throat. And then I coughed. And now he's crying. And now he's got the hiccups. Oh, Stu. - Stu? - Yeah?

Yeah, it used to sleep with me before we even got you. My blankie! He's not very nice. Ow! That's not how you get things from a brother, Tommy. It's not? No, it is not. Here, watch. Hey, that's my Reptar, Lillian! - Is not, Phillip! - Is too, Lillian! - Is not! - Is too! Is not! See, Tommy? Now you try it. Teddy mine! - Mine! - Mine! - Mine! - Mine! - Mine! - Mine! Gosh, Tommy learns fast. Yeah. Hurry, Pop, they'll be here to pick it up any minute. Daddy, why can't I watch Shirleylock Holmes at our house? I'll never be able to hear it with that new baby squawking the whole time. Now, sweetheart, Daddy's got to put in a little overtime today, so that Mommy won't be so ashamed of his quarterly earnings. Hi, Uncle Stu. Sorry to hear your pony is so slow. We don't have a pony, Angelica. Then how come you told Mommy Aunt Didi got saddled with a loser? "Loser"? I... Excuse me, bro. My tax deductions are crying! You can't deduct them if you don't have any income! Tommy! Dil! Boys, what are you doing? Dil, what say we give Tommy a little turn with the bear? Huh? Or not. Hey, champ, why don't you come with me for a minute? I got something to show you that's even better than your old teddy bear. We weren't gonna give you this until you were a little bit older, but I think now's the right time. Shiny, huh? And Grandpa Lou put your picture inside. I know it's hard, Tommy. You have a little brother now, and that's a big change. Dil can be pretty tough to get along with, huh? But sometimes little brothers, they aren't everything you'd hoped they'd be. That's why big brothers have got to have faith. And one day, you'll see, he'll change. - Ooh! - After all, you've got responsibility now. I know I can trust that you'll stick by Dil's side and be a swell big brother. Sponsatility. - Wow! - Wow! What is that, you guys? Reptar! On wheels. What do you think it's for? I don't know. I bet it could take us to the baby store. Great idea, Lillian. We could take Dil to the hopsicle - and get Tommy's moneys back. - Yeah. - It's money back bearantee. - Guys. Guys, Tommy's not gonna be happy about this. Well, he's sure not happy now. Well... You watch. Once Dil goes back to the baby store, Tommy will be happy. I don't know about this. What are you doing? We-- Well, actually, Lillian was... We're taking Dil back to the hopsicle, Tommy. We're gonna get your moneys back. What? You can't do that. My mommy and daddy want to keep him. See? See? Why? All he does is cry and poop. - So do you. - I don't cry that much. Well, you poop an awful lot. Look who's talking, Mr. Chocolate Pants. I am not a poopie monster! More Shirleylock Holmes: Girl Detective right after these messages. - We thought you'd be happy, Tommy. - Well, I'm not. Hey, babies. Knock it off. Cynthia and me are trying to watch TV. Huh? Hey, hands off the merchandise, pinkie. Whoa! - Pretty good. - Pretty good. Be nice, Angelica. He didn't mean it. You wanna ride in a wagon? I'll give you a ride, to outside space. Ow! My show! Next commercial, you babies are in big trouble! All aboard. Just walk away, Chuckie. Walk away. Oh! Wait for me! - Which way to the hopsicle? - We're not going to the hopsicle! Well, we're going somewheres. Uh, pardon me. Pickup for Pickles to Japan? Take it away, take it away. Yeah, have a good day. Pipe down, Spike! Me and Cynthia are watching... Cynthia? Nice try, babies. Now give me back my... Cynthia! They took Cynthia. Spike. Come on. You're gonna be my butthound. We gotta search every doghouse, playhouse, tree house, and dollhouse! I want those foogitives back in custardy. Bad dog! Bad dog! Stop! Deed, just go to the spa and relax. Pop and I are doing fine taking care of the... Pop? Where's the crate? Huh? Huh? Oh. Uh, I guess the delivery folks must have come. Wow! They loaded her up and everything, huh? Stu, let me talk to Tommy. Sure, I'll let you talk to Tommy. Um, Pop, where are the kids? That's funny.

I've turned this plane upside down, and I assure you there are no children. - No. - We found a kid, but he's not the one you're looking for. Tommy! Sprout? Dil! Angelica? Where can they be? We gotta find them! Find what? Einstein here lost the kids. I lost the kids? See? Where are we? I don't know. It looks kinda like the park. Only biggerer. Biggerer? This place is biggerer than the park and the backyard all put together. This is bad, you guys. This is bad. Uh-oh, Tommy, I think your brother is broked again. Oh, no. Dil, are you okay? I think he's gonna explode. - Poopie. - What? Pooping! Ew! Well, I guess we'll have to change his diapie. What do you mean, "we"? I can't believe you left them with your father. The man slept through Pearl Harbor, for heaven's sakes. I sounded the alarm as soon as I could. Ah, Mrs. Pickles, did your son have any enemies? - Oh. - Uh-huh. Any underworld or mob connections? He is a baby! The powder goes on his bottom, Tommy! Well, I'm doing the best I can. - Pee-pee. - Look out. Stop it, Dil. Get off me. Frog! Frog! Ah! - Your brother made a frog jump on me! - Stop it. - Stop it. - Stop it. - You stop it! - Stop it. - Stop it. - Stop it. Hey, guys, maybe we should stop playing around and figure out how to get home. But, Tommy, we don't even know where we are. I know. I've got my sponsatility! What's a sponsatility, Tommy? Sounds yucky. No, it's what you get for being a big brother. It's just like Okey-Dokey Jones uses when he has to find his way home. I thought that's called a crumpus. Well, my dad gave it to me, and he called it a sponsatility. - Where's it say to go? - Well, um... Uh, hmm... This way. Ah, hmm... That's the way! Straight up that hill! Whoa! Bad dog! Bad dog! Stop! Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! You know, not all dogs go to heaven. There he is. Mr. Pickles, is it true you shipped your own children to Tokyo in a wooden box? Is it true a dingo ate your baby? Mr. Pickles, how many pecks of pickled peppers did you pick? Look. Childhood, a time of innocence, a time of joy. A time of unspeakable, unrelenting tragedy. Mrs. Pickles, tell us how it feels to know you may never see your children again. Criminy! Can't you pit bulls show some compassion? I'm so sorry. Forgive me. Please tell us how it feels to know you may never see your children again. - That's it! Let me at him! - Hold your horses, Betty. All right! Hold on, Jonathan. There's an alarming crowd at my in-laws', indicating either a yard sale or a family tragedy. - Let me get back to you. - It's the brother. Hey! Mr. Pickles, how does it feel knowing your brother lost your only daughter? He what? Share your pain. You're breaking my arm! Only 'cause I can't reach your neck! - You moronic idiot! - And there you have it. Two sour Pickles and young Tammy, baby Dale, the twins Bill and Jill, little Chunky and poor Amelia, all vanished without a trace. I'm Rex Pester, and I'll be back with more Big Action News. Mr. Swenson on Center saw Angelica and Spike run through his garden and head north on I-99. - My baby! - Let's go! Private First Class Pickles reporting for duty. Just get in. Come on. Good job, you guys. We're almost there. Good, Dil. Now, play nice. Not much fun back there, is it? We're doing okay. That's some good hitting there, Dilly. I'm hungry. Right about now my daddy'd be making me a fried bologna sandwich. Mmm! I can almost smell that burning. Ooh! It tastes all crunchy. Stop it, Chuckie. You're making me hungry. Oh, no. We can't see our houses from here, Tommy. We can't see any houses from here. We're doomed. Doomed. Doomed, I tell you. Mrs. Pickles, I know this is hard for you, but can you identify this binky? This is all Dil's fault, right, Chuckie? - Uh... - Nuh-uh! This never would have happened if you hadn't putted him in the wagon in the first place. Right, Chuckie? Um, nuh-uh! It's not our fault you got a bad, naughty, stinky baby for a brother! He's not naughty. He's just a... He's just a baby! How could you be mad just because you're, um... standing there all nakey? I mean, I'm sure he's just trying to help. And 'sides, it's hot-- phew-- 'sploring in the woods all day. A little breeze feels good. Just what I needed. Oh, thank you, Dil. Those hippups are really starting to bug me. Face it, Tommy. Having a baby brother just isn't what you expected. Hey, you guys, look. Somebody's house. Tommy was right. Wow! My sponsatility does work. Yeah, but who'd have a house way out here in the forest? Maybe a lizard lives there. A lizard? You know, a big guy with a pointy hat that grants wishes. All's we gots to do is knock on the door and say we wanna go home. See? Then everything will be back to Norman. - Thank Bob. - Thank you, Bob. Come on, guys! We're off to see the lizard! Tommy, are you okay? I'm fine. I just tripped in a little hole, that's all. Gosh, it looks kinda like Spike's feet, only if he was a giant. I saw feetprints like that in our storybook. A wolf made them, and then he ate that little red riding girl. A wolf ate a girl? Uh... They got her out. I don't think it's a wolf, Chuckie. If it was, we'd hear him say... That was pretty good. I didn't do anything. - Do you see the wolf? - I don't know what he looks like. Teeth! Teeth and fur! And teeth! No, Dil. Bad Dil. No. I am Reptar! Margaret? That's your name, isn't it? I'm sure you've run afoul of many a scary pedestrian. But out here, we have what you might call... Hmm. How should I put it? Actual danger. Danger? Grizzlies that'll rip the top off your car. Bobcats, wolves, wolverines, which are something entirely different. And dragons. Tommy, I saw some grown-ups. Stop! Stop! I don't know how. Well, I hope you figure it out, 'cause I didn't bring no bathing suit! Whoa! Ah! Phew! Any further, and I would have needed a fresh diapie. Dil, no! Aqua Reptar, engage. I'm telling you, I saw a dragon. Margaret. A big, green, fire-breathing dragon. I've got to call headquarters. While you're at it, you might ask for a new assignment, say, a city park. 'Cause, you see, out here in the country, you have to be just a little tougher. The dragon! I just saw it! I saw it! Where? Where? Where? Here? Where? Bingo. Lookee here. A wrapper from a Cynthia sweet bar. My angel. She's been here. Yep, I figure she's tracking the sprouts. It's the Pickles' blood. I myself spent 15 days tracking Sitting Bull through the Northwest Territory. - The year was 19... - Over here! We found some wheel tracks and baby footprints heading into the woods. Well, actually, Howard found them. Although, see, I saw them. They must be in my Reptar Wagon. It's the perfect children's toy. You and your stupid inventions! My stupid inventions? That's it! All right, the pups are in the woods. You men, follow those tracks. We'll head to the ranger's station and start the search from there. Now, move! Hut, hut, hut, hut! Stu, where are you going?

Now, I knew my Dactar would come in handy. Pop, are you okay? Oh, Pop. Do you think we'll still be able to find the lizard's house, Tommy? Uh... Oh, sure, Chuckie.

Those are our feetprints, Chuckie. You're leading us around and around, Tommy. But it was working before. I don't think it ever worked. I think your sponsatility's broke, just like your brother. My brother is not broke! He pulled the lever! He tried to send us into the big Jacuzzi. We could have been drownded. Hey, you guys! What is it, Chuckie? Clown!

I'll get the lizard to wish him back into a people. But the lizard's only gonna give us one wish. Yeah, and if you use it up on Dil, how are we gonna get home? He's my brother, Chuckie. I have to wish him back. - You can't do that. - Yes, I can. What would you do if Phil turned into a monkey? That's different. I like Phillip! 'Sides, you'd be wasting your wish anyway, 'cause that's not even your brother. Wait a minute. What Lillian means is, um... the monkeys kind of took baby Dil, and we just-- We thought you wouldn't mind a baby monkey instead. - What? - Lookee, Tommy, nobody likes him. We're gonna find that lizard, Tommy. You can find your brother by yourself. Will you help me, Chuckie? Sorry, Tommy. But... But you're my bestest friend. Yeah? Well, if I'm your bestest friend, then how come when I got throwed up on, you didn't help me? Huh? Huh? And when I falled overboard, you didn't help me. And then when the monkey dropped me, you didn't even care about my boo-boo. Face it, Tommy. You don't got a bestest friend no more. All you gots is a brother. Oh, um... Fine. I'll go find him by myself. You dumb butthound! Fine. I hope you turn into a frog.

My splendid monkeys, come to papa. Who's your daddy? Babies and monkeys, both lost. Now both found. This is my story, pal. I'm Rex Pester. Stay tuned. No, not the toupee. No. Go get him, you little simians! Time for your close-up. Oh, dear. Wow. That was bad. I'm sorry about all this, Drew. It's all right, little brother. For a nincompoop, you're not half bad. Now I have my whole family together again. Remember there was Swamptar? Yeah, I remember that... So that was our big adventure. The monkeys founded their daddies, and we all gots to go home and have fried bologna sandwiches. Except Dil, cause he gots no teeth. But if you think things went back to the way they was before, you're wrong, cause now, thanks to baby Dil, they was even better.
