(GUNSHOTS) (HORSE NEIGHING) (FUSION MUSIC PLAYS) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (GRUNTS) (GUNSHOT) That reb never misses. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) How many we lose last night? A couple. Four or five. Casualties, Sergeant? No. Done lit out. SOLDIER: By the principles of war, that is still considered desertion. I don't know about no considering. Now's the time to get, if you're quick enough. (CHUCKLES) Well, you ain't. You taking pretty good care of that weapon, don't you, Hollis? Yeah. I guess I kind of like something simple I can hold on to. SOLDIER: I guess everybody needs something to hold on to. Some people need to believe in something, and other people need to touch something. Well, I wouldn't know anything about that. (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (HORSE NEIGHING) (OH, SUSANNA PLAYS) General Lee has surrendered in Virginia. We are hereby ordered to lay down our arms. Do you surrender your men, sir? You are surrendering to those men, sir. You will show a white flag so that they can see it. (HORSE NEIGHING) Where you going, Hollis? Not to no Yankee prison camp. I'm coming, too. Not with me, you ain't. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS) (MEN LAUGHING) (ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES) Thank you, ma'am. That'll be a dollar each. I'm Matt Graves, girlie. (CHUCKLES) Heard of me, ain't ya? Matt Graves? Why don't you take care of the bill here? With what? I'll be busy with that fellow over there, trying to trade off our horses. So just tell him who you are. So if you give me them two horses over there, $10, I figure you've made yourself a good trade. No deal. You couldn't give them horses away. I could if I had to. (GRUNTING) Well, you gotta teach him a lesson. Joined the Yankee army and won the war. HOLLIS: Let me have that nigger. Put him on a horse. Get! What took you so long? Just covering your rear. Again. Last time I saved a nigger's life, he said, uh, "Thank you, sir." You got a name? Duncan. HOLLIS: Rough nick, huh? My name's Hollis. This here is the famous Matt Graves, you probably heard about. (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) I don't like the way things are going. What I mean is, here we are, two busted rebels out in the middle of nowhere with a rock in our pockets. The way I see it, we been running so long we don't know how to do nothing else. It's time we stop, boy, dug our heels in. What did you have in mind? I been doing some figuring. Well, you with me? It sounded like damn fool talk last night, but in daylight...

I'll expect you at the ranch. It will be my pleasure, ma'am. "It will be my pleasure, ma'am." Whenever you're ready, Captain. (KNOCK ON DOOR) (SNORING) (KNOCK ON DOOR CONTINUES) (GRUNTS) You got lead in your britches? What the hell y'all want? If you're the sheriff, we got two dead men out here. So you're the boys that brought in the stage, huh? You better have a good reason for getting me up this time of day. WOMAN: You! You there! Yes, you. Is Captain Hollis about? He's in talking to the sheriff, ma'am. Please, give him this when he comes out. Don't lose it. I'll make an effort to, ma'am. And thank you again. No reward, huh? (CHUCKLES) Well, that's the thanks a citizen gets for risking his neck. Come on, Matt. SHERIFF: Hold on, reb. I noticed you boys are still wearing your uniforms. No cause to shoot, Sheriff. The war is over. You boys come into this town like you won the war. Let me tell you something, reb. A lot of you boys been coming around here lately. Most of you looking for handouts, some of you for action. Well, I give everybody the same chance, one hour to get out. I wasn't planning on settling down. That your nigger out there? (LAUGHS) You just make sure you take him along, boy. (DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Get out there and clean up that stage. Go on! What's that, a stud fee? No, it's a reward for turning you in. I'm hungry. This looks like an eatin' house. Are you sure this is an eating place? It's gotta be. Breakfast? Ladies, we've been riding all night and we're just plain hungry. (CHUCKLES) This here is Pearl. The law after you? Not yet. Ain't that a picture, Hollis? Sunlight dancing in all that gold hair. (CHUCKLES) You were saying about the sheriff? Most of the men in this town are on the run. He's got to be hard. He's not a mean man, really. As long as... He gets some sleep. You look like you could shoot a pretty good stick.

What about the sheriff? If he gets in the way, you shoot him first. Hey, Matt, anything happen to Captain Hollis, I'll shoot you first.

If I had a little bigger stake, I could make a lot of money in there tonight. Help me out? I already gave all I got to Hollis. (SCOFFS) Again? I gotta get my money back. You want to make it $100? That's about all I got. Go ahead and break. (INTENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) I reckon I quit now. Around here, the loser says when we quit. Is that a rule of the house? It's the rule of any house. $900. Make it $1,000. $100 a ball on top. Sorry, mister, I just don't have that kind of money. Well, I made a little money on you tonight. Try again. $100 a ball it is. We ain't finished yet. HOLLIS: (WHISPERS) Duncan? Over here. I'll meet you later. MAN: You out there. Put it down, son. Virgil tells me there's a pool game worth betting on. So am I. Later. (GUNSHOT) Time to get. We didn't agree on the stakes. $1,000. I don't see your money. Let's see it. Son of a... Argh! (COCKS GUN) Guns on the table. Everybody. All right, now get out of here. Are you all right? How much you win? Where's the rest of it? It got a little tight down there, so I gave it to a friend of mine to hold till things blow over. Trust me. You big ol' rebel. (VIOLIN PLAYS DIXIE) You know, I wasn't quite sure what it was about you, but I think I'm beginning to find out. You know, in this business, a girl's got to be a little careful. (CHUCKLES) I mean, in her relationships. Yeah, I'd kind of think so. Oh, come on, you know what I mean. It isn't every night I put all I got on a man. HOLLIS: Yeah. I'd kind of think that, too. Well, it's usually the other way around. You know something else, rebel? What's that? You and me make a pretty good pair. Hollis? Yeah? You know, I went through hell for that money, don't you? Yeah, I know. All that hell I went through, and now I finally got a chance to get out. Don't you worry, honey. We'll put this on account, then, okay? What do you mean, "They locked themselves in"? They did. About time we let 'em out. It looks like you're gonna be around a while. I'm leaving. Where's the money? Duncan's got it. Where's he? Don't know. I ain't gonna ask you what made you give a nigger $4,000, but I'll tell you something, Hollis, I'm gonna get my money. And I may lynch myself a nigger when I'm gettin' it. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) SHERIFF: How about another pool game, Jake? Get another drink, Al. Is that right, Virgil? Our town hustler got himself out-hustled? (LAUGHS) You know there's no sin in that. But I'll tell you something, Al. If I'd lost all that money, I guarantee you there's no way that boy would get out of town. No, no, sir. Give me a drink, Al. (GLASS CLINKING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) RUBY: Pearl, honey, wake up! Go away. Open up! We've got to get Hollis out of here. All right, hustler, where's my money? You lost it, mister. Now get out of here. You thievin' bastard! Come back to bed, Pearl. You had one chance tonight, mister. You got one more, if you leave now. Why, you... Ahhh! (GUNSHOT) (GROANING) (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYS) (HORSES GALLOPING) Now hear me, boy. Everywhere there's a rose... Every direction, anywhere you look. Look out there. What do you see? Nothing. Look harder. Look where the sky gets bluer. I don't see nothing. It ain't in the seein', it's in the lookin'. You gotta think it, and if you think it and believe it, well, there it is. I don't see nothing. At least the clothes fit, Captain. And they say, "If they fit, wear them." You and my brother might have been twins except that he was, well, my brother. Yeah, well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have a little trouble returning the favor. I don't think you will at all, Captain. Not at all. Is this the same man? Now, tell us the story of what happened in town. Well, it wasn't much. You know, you ladies sure know how to eat a meal. DUNCAN: Ain't you hungry, boy? Come on, now. You gotta be hungry. You can't always stand back. Sometime you gotta reach and grab it when it comes along. You got a name, boy? Hey, boy, you gotta have a name. Good night. (DOOR CLOSES) (PIGS OINKING) Did you see a black man around here the last couple of days? No. Can't say that I have. I'd notice him if he'd been around. Why? Stole some money from me. I'm offerin' a reward to anybody helps me find it. Lot of money, was it? Enough. Well, I just might be a little interested in that reward. Isn't the meat tend enough, Captain? I noticed you're not eating. DUPRES: Have you seen Captain Hollis? CAMELIA: No. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Well, now, who are you? Duncan sent me. I never asked thanks to any man in my life. I've been going by gut feeling on you. Now, you better use that gun or come across. I never thought I'd have that much money in my britches in a whole lifetime. Your choice. MAN: Drop it. You know what we're after. You might as well tell us. We'll find it anyway. Nothing. That's enough. Throw 'em out. You keeping pretty good company, are you, Matt? MATT: I told you I was gonna get my money back. Now, there's only two way. Either the nigger's got the money and won't tell, or he never had it at all. Maybe that little whore in town has got it. One way or the other, we're gonna find out. (MATT CHUCKLES) All right, nigger lover. How'd you like to carve yourself one for dinner? (GUNFIRE) Where is it? Well, it was good while it lasted. All right. So we split it right here. Ain't no split. We'll make it. Take your choice. I got a debt to pay in town. That's playin' a damn fool. (SIGHS) Well, I guess there never was much else. Maybe it does to you what you said it does. Having all that money in your britches, makes a man do funny things. I gotta see a lady in town. (YOU, ME AND A FRIEND OF MINE PLAYING) ♪ You...

BEDROOM MAN: Sheriff! Some big guy threw me out of Pearl's, and he's got two niggers with him. That's them. Just like I told you. All right. I'll take care of it. Virgil. We'll back you up. (MUMBLING) All right, all right, all right. But I'm calling the shots. Let's go, boys. Hell, I don't know about all this, but I didn't even get my money's worth. This looks like trouble.

They won't shoot if you come out without your guns. You hear me, Hollis? When it's dark enough, we make a break. They're moving around out there. What's he up to? I don't know. He can't shoot us out and he can't talk us out. Ready? Be nice to use that front door just once. I think I smell Matt Graves. There gotta be a better way out of here. The window.
