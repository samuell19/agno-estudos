I met these girls, and it's kind of cool to know a guy, you know? Sounds kind of dumb when you say it, but... Hey, listen, man, whatever you want. But, honestly, don't buy drugs to impress girls. I'll take the molly though. $60. MAN: The ATM would only give me $100. I know we said three, but I've got $100 here. Um, that's no worries, I can give you five for... One...

Yeah, yeah, Crumbs bakery. I sell giant cupcakes a couple days a week, but I'm at community college racking up credits. Awesome. Oh, uh, here, sorry. Thank you. So, you do magic? I mean, a little. I'm getting pretty good at it. (BOTH CHUCKLE) You know, I have never seen a cute magician before. I'm starving. He sent a card on my birthday, but that's about it. I haven't seen him in about a year. Yeah, he moved out fast. Like, crazy fast. Well, I mean, at least Arizona's not that far if you wanted to visit. That's what he said. Yeah. Ifsfunnythough, 'cause,Hke, I get it, you know. Like, my mom has always been a handful. And Arizona, it's far enough away for him to get away from her, but close enough to still come see me. Not that he does, but whatever. Itdoesn% really bother me, but my mom is definitely still dealing with the whole thing. And she really needs me right now. But once my mom is better, I can figure out where I wanna finish up school. Mmm. God, I'm sorry. I feel like I've been talking for hours. No, I asked. It's fine. What about you? Well, my dad passed a while back, and my mom passed last year, so it's just me and my little sister, Tina, the love of my life. She's such a smart kid, you know. I just wish I can move her into a neighborhood with a better school. Yeah. Surround her with better people. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Yeah. Uh, she's gonna be something big. I know it. (DISCONNECTS) (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) (DISCONNECTS) I grew up in a school district, and,honesHy, except for one teacher I had, nobody oared. And I just... (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Do you need to get that? No. It's fine. Get it if you need to. Okay, it'll just be a second. Yeah. Yeah. Totally, man. Yeah. I'll be right there. No, it's cool. (SIGHS) I'm the worst. I'm sorry, I gotta go. Society of magic ruining a perfectly good first date? (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES) I'm kidding, it's fine. I promise. Let's do this again, though. Please. Ought to be good enough for you, young buok. Hey. Ready? What's going on? Found out where this Maurice guy lives. Homie moves into our backyard and starts selling coke like I don't exist. I mean, we're gonna pay him a little visit. (GANG LAUGHS) Talk to him about etiquette. Let's go. Put that shit out. Smoke after. PACKY: Yeah, put that shit out, man, smoke it after. MAURICE: What the fuck? PACKY: Sit down, loser! Sit down! Maurice, right? Check to make sure no one else is here. (GUN COCKS) Get up. So, here's what I don't understand. You moved to this neighborhood, started selling, and never thought to introduce yourself? (SCOFFS) Man, listen, I don't give a fuck about who you are. See, that's the problem with kids like you. You come out hot-tempered and bad-mannered. There's no respect. I don't even know you. And I don't need to know you. Maurice, now don't play me like that. You can't say you've never heard of me, because you guys are out there telling people that your shit is cheaper than mine. So, you know me well enough to compare yourself. That's not good business. Where the fuck do you come from where people do business like that? West Covina? Yo... You know what? Why don't you just get the fuck outta here, old man? Here, here, here, take some chips with you. (LAUGHING) Oh, shit. Wow! What... (LAUGHING) I mean... That's what we're gonna do now. Okay. See, even your boys are talking like you. (GRUNTS) Sit the fuck down! Now! You gotta lead by example. (GROANS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANS AND COUGHS) Maurice. Maurice. You and I, we could be friends. We really could. And if you don't like me, we could at least be co-workers. And we both know you don't always have to like your co-workers. So, your options. You can go back to wherever the fuck you came from, or you can get comfortable, stay right here, sell my shit, and kick me 30%. (MAN GROANING) Think about it. Let me know. All this weed and no snacks? Man, this party's whack. Fuck! (CLATTERING) Man, get the fuck up. RAMONE: That gun slipped out of your hand like some cartoon shit. We gotta put sticky tape on it next time. (ALL LAUGH) (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) Yo, you're one of my boys now. Word? BO: I never thought it'd get dangerous. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV) You guys never done something like this before? A stick-up? No. Hell no. And that's what I liked about Angelo. I mean, he didn't seem like the gangbanger. Just a cool guy who'd help me make money off kids who wanted to party. I don't know, this is turning into something I would've never signed up for. And I thought this whole thing would be temporary. I mean, a year flashes by and I'm still a drug dealer. I need to get out of this, Georgi. Now. BO: Eight of clubs, okay? Keep it facing me. So, the card is gonna stay in your hand. I'm not messing with it. This is all you. All right. So, I need you to name another card. Any card besides the eight of clubs. Three of diamonds? Three of diamonds. You sure? You can change your mind. You're making all the decisions. Three of diamonds. Okay. Turn it around. MAN: Oh, my... WOMAN: No way! (LAUGHS) Are you kidding me? (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Uh, 'new. HOLLY". Hey, what's up? Not much. What are you up to? Just out performing. Are you working tonight? Yeah. Cool, where at? Uh,NoHo, maybe hit CityWalk in a bit. Tourists love magic. Damn, I was just, you know, seeing if you wanted to catch a movie or something. Uh, maybe tomorrow night, though? I could make you dinner maybe? All right. Are you gonna be working? loan pick you up. Perfect. Oh, shit, I have a customer. Text me. (CALL DISCONNECTS) Oh, oh... Okay, any one you want, all right? WOMAN: Okay. I want you to sign your name on that card. You don't need to hide it from me, we all should know which one is yours. (WOMAN CHUCKLES) Shuffle your card into the deck. Get it lost in there. Perfect. And there's a lot of things in our lives that can trap us. It could be a person, a problem. There're so many things that can wall us in. But these barriers only exist if we let them. We can do whatever we want if we just believe we're able to. There's a card in here with your name on it, right? Uh-huh. Let's say 51 of these cards are too scared to trust themselves. Too afraid to believe that they can do whatever they want. Okay. Now, your card, your card knows there's no wall, no limit, no barrier. Okay. Is that your card? Oh, my God. No, it's not. (LAUGHING) So, where did you meet? On Larchmont. He was performing outside my work. I like your nose ring. Thanks. I want one, but Bo says they're ugly. Oh, does he? He said so. So, is Bo your boyfriend? Uh, we actually just kind of met. Do you have a boyfriend? Yeah. Three of them. Three? Who are these boys? Jacob, Elijah and Daniel. (TINA CHUCKLES) I'm gonna die alone. (ALL LAUGH) I thought boys might like you. Well, you need to let them know you got a big brother who'll beat them up if they ever get rude. Okay. (ALL CHUCKLE) GEORGY. So, she's a lot cooler than you. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I have no idea how this happened. Yeah, well, family dinner is a totally normal second date. Good job there. Was that bad? You're fine. You guys are cute. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Yo. You weren't picking up. Oh, my bad. My phone is charging in my room. Oh, my bad. Hello there, ladies. I'm Angelo. I work with Bo. Hi, I'm Tina. I'm Holly. Georgi. Very nice to meet you. You must be Bo's little sister? Yeah, and Holly is maybe-Bo's-girlfriend. And Georgi's our friend. (ANGELO CHUCKLES) Well, you have a good one on your hands here. I'm so sorry for interrupting, but I just need to talk with Bo for a minute. Chat outside, real quick? Yeah. What's up? So, that motherfucker Maurice didn't take my warning too seriously. The dude's back out there selling again. Like, really, man? We hear he's partying nearby. Ought to catch him on his way out. Right now? We're in the car. Hurry up. (CAR ENGINE ROARS) (PLAYING HARMONICA) (GIRLS GIGGLING) Uh, hey, guys- I have to head out with Angelo for a second. I like him. Um, can you watch Tina for, like, a few hours? Yeah. I can stay, too. I mean, I don't wanna put you out or anything, I'm sure you've got things to do. I don't mind. Honestly, I'd rather stay if that's cool? Please stay. We'll see you when you get back. Thanks. Hey. What was he doing here? TINA: Yeah. It's weird. HOLLY: Yep. It's cool. Always the same with me. Why are we leaving? It was fun. 'Cause I'm fucking tired. You can stay if you want to. I don't even care. You're my ride. Well, then I guess it's time to go home. (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) God damn it. MAURICE: Fuck! Fuck! MAN 1: Come on, baby. MAN 2: Damn it! MAN 3: Let's go. Let's go. (MAURICE GROANING) Let me go, man. (PAC KY YELLS) (ENGINE STARTS) Grab the tarp from under the sink. I thought we had a deal, man? Man, we had no deal about nothing. See, this is why I fucking kidnapped you. Look, man, if it's about a percentage, then fine. Homie, homie, homie. This is not about a percentage anymore. You are here because we made an agreement, and then you decided that you were above it. Now, how the fuck you think that makes me feel? Put the tarp down. You right-handed or left-handed? Am I what? Are you right-handed or left-handed? I'm a leftie. A southpaw? Ifeelhke you're fuckin' lying. Maybe not. Tighten that around his left arm. In oase you're wondering, I'm not gonna kill you tonight. You know what they used to do to liars and thieves back in the day? Wait, wait. Hey! Come on, man, wait. They'd cut a hand off. Spread 'em out. Wait... Come on, man. Wait, what are you... As clean as you can. What? As clean as you can. No. Why the fuck not? I can't. I'm sorry. Hey, Bo! This dude does not respect us. He doesn't give a fuck about us. And if we don't show him who we are, he will come after us. Whose side are you on, Bo? Come on. Come on, Bo. Come on. Come on, man. Please, please, please. Don't do this, man, please. Okay? I'm asking you. Please don't do it, man. Come on, donfidoit man, please. Please, please, no, don't do it, man, please. Please, man, don't do it, okay? Please, man, don't do this, I'm beggin'.

If I hear that you're selling again, I'm gonna kill you and every person you know. Now, get the fuck out of my house. (RETCHING) Let's go. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) ANGELO: There's gonna be a little more business with Maurice out of the picture. You can handle a key, right? Yeah. Of course. Boom. Your normal re-up's in there, too, but you're gonna be working with a lot more money, so pay attention. (MUSIC CONTINUES ON CAR STEREO) Oh... I'm having a party at the crib this weekend. You should come through. Bring your girl if you want. If not, a bunch will already be there. Word. (ENGINE ROARS) Hey. Hey. Why don't you take my bed? You don't need to sleep on the couch. Oh, shut up. We can sleep in the same bed. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV) Hey, uh, you want a T-shirt or something? Yeah, sure. Hey, uh, thanks for watching T tonight. (TINA HUMMING) Oh, um, what kind of cookies are you going to make? Or are you gonna make a cake? What makes you think I'm baking something? Because you have two boxes of baking soda. (CHUCKLES) Oh, uh... I'm not sure. We'll figure out something. GEORGI: Holy shit. How much is that? BO: It's almost two kilos. One of Angelo's cut with baking soda. This is a bad idea. Selling all this, I could pay Angelo his cut and still walk away with $15,000. That's enough money to get out. Evenifyou sell all this, you really think Angelo's gonna letyouleave? (SIGHS) I don't know. I hope. I know it's not my place to say this, but there's no one else here to say it to you. I don't want you to do this. It's too dangerous. I'm sorry. It's already done. Hey! I'd like to re-up. Or reorder. (CLEARS TH ROAT) Hey. Wait, what? What happened? Where are you? I can come over. No, that's fine. I'll meet you at my place. Hey. Hey. Thanks. (SNIFFLES) She doesn't mean it. It's just the divorce that's still hurting her. And I don't know, when she drinks, she just has a hard time moving on. It's... But she hits you. I mean, I saw your bruises the other night. No one deserves that. You can stay here as long as you need to. I mean, it's not the Four Seasons, but we try to keep it pretty clean... Sorry. (CHUCKLES) I'm never the girl with the mascara running down her face. Thank you. (EXHALES) Morning. You sleep okay? What is that? What? That thing in your arm? Oh, uh... It's part of an effect. But what is it? Hlooks kind of infected. BO: It's not that bad. Bo, for a magic trick? Why would you do that to yourself? The first time I ever saw a magic trick, I was with my mom and dad on the Venice Boardwalk. And there was this guy, this old Italian guy with this little Jack Russell. He had this small stand where he performed. He did a lot of card and coin stuff, but there was this one thing he did that just stuck with me forever. He took a pocket knife and pressed it into the center of his hand. It went through his skin with a hard push. Popped through the other side. He held his hand right in front of my face. It didn't make any sense, you know. It looked like it was going straight through. So, he asked me to pull it out. So, I grabbed the knife, and it just slid right out. When he showed me his hand, there was no blood, no hole. Nothing to say that there was just a freaking knife stabbed through his hand. My 7-year-old brain was just exploding... (EXHALES) So I asked him. I asked him how he did it. What'd he say? He said he could only share his secrets with other magicians. I went back last year and saw that he was still there. I showed him a few tricks, we talked shop for a little bit. And I told him the same exact story I just told you. Did he tell you how he did the trick? It wasn't a trick. It was real. I mean, for a year, this guy stabbed a knife through his hand. Each time, he cut a little deeper, let the scar tissue grow. Then do it again. After a while, he had stabbed a clean hole straight through. And because of the scar tissue, there was no blood. So, when he performed, he just covered his hands with a little bit of latex andifdlook like brand-new skin. That's the effect. I mean, it's so obvious, but you wouldn't think anyone would go that far. Yeah, he cut a freakin' hole in his hand. I mean, is all that worth it just for a trick? I mean, can't you do tricks that don't hurt you? Anyone can learn a trick, but doing something no one else is willing to do makes you a magician. I can do something no one else can. (HOLLY SIGHS) (VOLTMETER BEEPS) (BEEPS RAPIDLY) BO: So, you think the spirit is sitting in the right chair? WOMAN: Yeah, I think so. BO: And you? Yeah, I agree, right chair. I mean, are you sure? You can change your mind, 'cause I'm going to ask it to get up in a second. (WOMEN CHUCKLE) Okay. Spirit, would you leave the table please? (CHUCKUNG) (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHING) (ALL CHUCKLING) (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) (CARTOON MUSIC PLAYING ON TV) Hey, man. Yeah, I was heading over there in a few. Word. Later.

(GRUNTS) Why the fuck are you cutting my drugs? I don't know what you're talking about, man. We're not gonna play this game. You ungrateful piece of shit! (GRUNTS) I gave you a job when you needed it most, and now you're fuoking me? (GROANS) (PANTING) How much did you cut it? Just another kilo, man. I swear I was gonna pay you back. Fucking hell. I swear. I swear. I swear. No,no,no,no,no! Come here, you motherfucker. (WHIMPERING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) You know what? I want my kilo's full value back without you taking a cut. Obviously. Another 15 since you doubled my product. And let's throw one more 15k on top of that for asshole tax. So, if you're following me, that's 45k, and I want it by midnight next Sunday. Get the fuck out of my house. (MUSIC CONTINUES) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Hey, close the door. Bo, what happened? I don't want Tina to see. What happened? Hey. I messed up, okay? I messed up bad. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Tell me what happened. (SHUSHING) Tell me what happened. If you never want to see me again, I get it. I mean, I really hate that I was lying to you about it, but, honestly, lthought I'd be out of this by now. You don't seem like the type of girl that'd want to date a drug dealer. Okay, stop. I'm gonna help you figure this out. There's no way I can get that kind of money. I only have $5,000 saved up. Okay, but you have to try, right? If he's as bad as you say he is, you don't have a choice. Look, sell off what you have. Keep performing until you can find a way to get the rest of the money. And I'll see what I can do, too. To working in hell. $35,914. You sold everything? Everything. Here. What's this? It's only $900. Wait, where'd this come from? I had it saved up. It was supposed to be for school applications. Holly... You're not allowed to give it back. I don't even know what to say... You don't have to say anything. You know I'll pay you back. Yeah. (HOLLY SIGHS) Now, how do I get nine grand by midnight tomorrow? (HORN HONKS) Fuck! Is something bad going to happen to us? What? No. You're scared. I know. I'm sorry, T.

So, I got a job. Really? Yeah, buddies of mine have a band. They're going on a tour next week. It's shit money, but it's not this. Oh, my God. That's great. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hey, to getting out.

BO: I'm almost there. ljustneed a little more time. I didn't ask for you to get close, Bo. I asked for 45k by midnight tonight. I just need some more time. I want another 5k. (CAR RECEDING) Why couldn't I go in the house? Um... I'm gonna pick you up from school today, okay? Okay. All right. I love you. I love you, too. Have a good day. Okay. I don't know what else to do. I can't get any more money. I did everything that I could. I don't know, nothing's working. (SIGHS) Holly, I almost died. What? You and Tina have got to get out of here. You've gotta get out of LA. And I wanna come with you. But what about school and your mom? (SIGHS) What you said the other night, that I don't deserve this. I really needed to hear that. I do deserve better. And you do, too. Look, you guys could get out of here now, and I'd only be a few weeks behind you. My semester's almost over, and I could apply to some new schools over the summer. But where would we go? (CHILDREN PLAYING AND LAUGHING) Excuse me. Have you seen my sister? Tina? Tina Wolfe? Yeah, I think your uncle picked her up. Uncle? T, where are you? ANGELO: Homie, did you think I was kidding? Angelo? Get me my fucking money. If you touch my... (CALL DISCONNECTS) WOMAN: Everything okay? WOMAN: (ON RECORDING) I know you're in class, just wanted you to know that it's looking like I'll be working late tonight. I need you to snag T after school and get her to dance class. It's that studio on Walden. She knows where. I'll be out in plenty of time to pick her up. Oh, and there should be a 20 on the fridge. Go ahead and order yourself something if you get hungry before we get back, but no pizza tonight, please? Text me and let me know that you got this message, okay? All right? I love you. AUTOMATED VOICE: End of message. To replay this message, press... (CAR APPROACHING) (CAR DOOR OPENS) MR. GRANGER: BO'? Hey, Mr. Granger. You all right? I, uh... Come in. Come in. It's a little complicated. It always will be. Anything I can do? Do you remember the last project I did senior year? (SIGHS) Bo. Building an electromagnet in a shoebox is one thing, but in your arm? How long has this been infected? I'm taking care of it. It doesn't look like it. The negative is fed to my thumb and the positive to the rest of the fingers. The board is programed to read all the different inputs. It gives me a little bit of control over pitch, yaw and roll. But I need more power. I mean, the lithium-ions last a while, but their output, it's just... I need more output. Have you always run the battery straight to the electromagnet? Yeah. Huh. What about a feedback oscillator? A feedback oscillator would magnify the voltage. You could do that without touching the coil. But with a higher voltage, you'll be running into a new problem. You see, these wires in your arm are thin. You'd want a larger gauge with that much power, otherwise, it could overheat. But it's still possible, right? Yeah. I think so. So, a feedback oscillator. And a bigger battery. Do you have a soldering iron? (INAUDIBLE) (ELECTROMAGNET CRACKLES) (GRUNTS) (ELECTROMAGNET CRACKLES) (SIGHS) (EXHALES SHARPLY) (ELECTROMAGNET CRACKLING) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) This isn't for a trick, is it? For what it's worth, I didn't want to bail on the scholarship. But I had to. I just want you to know that. I do. Thanks. Please be careful. Listen, uh, if I'm not back in a half an hour, call the cops, okay? (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) It's like, "You're so fat, why are you "living in your mother's house?" (LAUGHING) Bo. You gotta be out of your fucking mind. (CHOKING) (BLOOD SPUTTERS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (PACKY SCREAMING) (WHIMPERING) (MUFFLED YELLING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Everybody, get out! Get out! (MUSIC STOPS) Angelo! Angelo! ANGELO: What the hell is goin' on? What the fuck are you doing here? You have my money? Where's my sister? Is she here? That's not the deal. Angelo, where the hell is my sister? Give me my money. This had nothing to do with Tina. You crossed a line when you took her. Bo, the fucked-up thing about all this, man, is that I liked you. You did good work. And you know what, I invested in you. But I'm getting so tired of people who have no fucking respect. I'm trying to build something here, and every corner I turn, there's another piece of shit who thinks they can just fuck me over. You did it behind my back, you did it to my face. I mean, where's the common fucking decency? I'm not gonna stand here and have you roll up inside my house, fucking my shit up, telling me you deserve some shit. So, let's make this an example. Not for you, but for the next motherfucker who thinks it's a good idea to fuck with Angelo. (GUN FIRES) (ELECTROMAGNET CRACKLING) What the hell? Shit. Where's Tina? Shit! Fuck! Where is she? (ANGELO SCREAMING) Oh, God! Where's my sister? Stop! Stop! She's fine. She's fine. Where is she? (GRUNTING) Shit! Stop! Oh, God! (GLASS SHATTERS) She's with my aunt. Where? Okay, stop, stop. Where?

She's fine. Oh, oome on! Look, we're good, all right? We're good. Just“ Just leave, all right? Oh, shit! $15,000. One kilo. What I actually owe you. Oh, gosh. (DOOR CLOSES) Oh, shit. Hey, are you okay? Where's Tina? We gotta go, she's close! Come on! (ENGINE TURNS OVER) (INHALES SHARPLY) (sesame) (WAVES CRASHING) Okay, Okay- (CROWD EXCLAIMING) (APPLAUDING) Thank you. Hey. Wanna go? Oh! Hey. Absolutely. Thank you, GUYS- T, go start your homework. Bo and I are going to start dinner, okay? Okay. I had my test today. Oh, yeah, I forgot to ask. IgotaB. B's not bad. (BOTH CHUCKLE) HOLLY: Did you hear from Georgi? BO: Yeah, she should be here this weekend. HOLLY: Sweet. What'd you do today? BO: Just working on that new trick. HOLLY: Are you ever gonna show me? BO: When it's ready. (CHUCKLES) It's gonna be something special. (TINKLING) (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) (SOFTLY) Bo. (ENERGY CRACKLING) Oh, my God!
