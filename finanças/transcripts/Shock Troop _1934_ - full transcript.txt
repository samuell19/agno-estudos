In 1934, the Munich firm "Aria" made the film "Assault Battalion 1917" aka "Stosstrupp 1917", which became one of the most popular films in the 3rd Reich. Stosstrupp 1917, one of the first films about everyday life at the front in the First World War, when shown in theatres, immediately drew the attention of millions of cinemagoers. From the point of view of contemporary film some scenes seem a bit stiff, and feigned The original film was considered lost for many years but recently the Federal Archives with the help of private collectors, restored the original soundtrack and film Print. Since some film fragments were stored in varying conditions, some portions of the film and sound track could not be restored even with modern audio and video equipment. But the result is still there: society can now see the film "Stosstrupp 1917" 70 years after its screening, and see the thoughts and feelings of the generation that embarked on the path of the Nazi dictatorship, which ultmately led to the Second World War.

Where was that? Reims line of trenches? An hour ago I see ... Thank you. Send a man immediately to Brigade Headquarters The enemy are entrenched on this line Open fire immediately and shell the line. At short intervals Attention! - What? Are you here? - And you? The only thing not fouled. Do you hear that? It's not the French It's too late. It's all over. We have lost the whole battalion. We have only three men left from10th company. And we go back to the front lines. Who have survived from the Assault Battalion? The three of us here. Heiner is in hospital With Fredl and Martl There is no one else 6 of 15 survived But not one Frenchman broke through the main defense. After losing the battle deep disappointment swept soldiers of the French Army To support its allies the British attacked the German positions with a new, incredible strength Flanders Information for Leave Peronnel Where should I go? My regiment has moved somewhere. You have to go to Bruges. Your regiment is in Flanders All is clear - thank you. What then...? - Hey, what are you doing here? - how cheerfull you look. I'm back from leave. I'm going to re-join my regiment. We are as well. We were discharged from hospital today - Then you are recovered? - Yeah. - And you, too? - As you can see. Tell me how it works in the company? And in our Assault Battalion? You're somebody I don't know. The new man - always asking things. And our Assault Battalion are same desperadoes as before! - Are we in a quiet area? - In a "quiet" area? Haha And do not ask. We are always in the "quiet areas" Read it. Flanders has already been shelled for 4 days We are, as always, "lucky" - Well, well, we always get it. - that is our share. Stop! Here is your position. Watch your front and look out for tanks. We will look out for them but how will we stop them? Now you can just think about it! Oh Lord! Let's go. It's not very nice, but at least we have a roof. Come on. Come down Gustav to the window - for one hour Unpack everything and bring all the gear ....and find something to sit on No one needs to know that we are here Oh, thats for me. So we'll be able to see. - How long are we going to stay here? - No one knows. When will it end? Small caliber, it's not dangerous to us. It seems that it will last 10 years. Aha! That's real! What do we do if we meet tanks? From the right of the trench? We have nothing to counter their treat I have something to use. We can produce a high-explosive bomb Come on. We do not have so many grenades here So we can't do it. But "Tommy" left them in abundance We will start to make our bomb and add their grenades. What do you think about this one explosive? You always find adventure "per se" If you do not believe me, go check Not today Today is the day of fasting, it is impossible to shed blood. Come on, don't quarrel. I can't stand the sight of blood! God, when is this abomination going to end? What will you do after the war? On that day, Carl gets drunk like no one has got drunk! I only think about how to get good sleep I will tell you I will not leave my bed for 3 days only to eat and, of course ... for a warm embrace I'll go home and marry. Well, my son was born a year ago Who wants to be a godfather? I will be. And me! And me! Not all at once! Peace will come Hans. What did you say? Peace. I can't imagine how it easy it will be to walk peacefully without being shot at. But they do not want peace apparently there is something in us that makes them hate us so much' It is too early to think about peace But when you come down to it.. no war has lasted more than 30 years. Well, it's finished. Now the tank can come. No, it is better not to let it come! I wonder where the front line is. I would like to know. I think I heard something. Somewhere near. I thought they were ours. No harm in dreaming. Hey, look here! There is something. Get ready. Maybe we should stay here? No, we will all get killed at the same time. You're in a war. We have to go out and fight Are you wounded? No, no, thank you. But of course it's terrible There are only three dead The others are not so far gone. I do not quite understand what happened. They came from two sides To surround us, that's what they wanted Look, there they are. There on the grass. But now it is possible to smoke a cigarette? Gladly! At least you can just stand on your feet Tony - he has died. Nonsense, he's still alive. Prop him up. Give him water. What happened? I'm cold It's nothing, Tony Sleep. Soon they will fly again. If they come I wan't to meet them in the open air I do not want to wait in here until I am beaten. Tanks!! - What? - Where? - They are coming right at us Do not move! Come on, pull it up One coming from the opposite direction! Stop! Where is he? Get out! Move! Is it possible? Our cellar is destroyed! I need some air! - That there is a new threat? - No, Herr Major. Points 4A, C, D do not meet any more What does that mean? "4B is occupied by the British I am badly wounded." That's it. It's just impossible! Herr Major, the British Tommies have broken through the defenses Do not shoot. We are wounded. My God, look at that. A war profiteer! Looks just like us! Ruddy swines! Aren't they? War and barbed wire The Artillery has arrived. - They support us? - that's it Get ready! Stick together. It's a creeping barrage. Just keep up Stand beside us See what the experienced soldiers are doing Stay close to me Hey, get out. Help is here - What happened? - The relief has come. Relief? Thank you, Lord! Where do weo go now? I don't know. But I will not stay here We will go look for another trench. Oh, I see. Well, let's go. Well, pals. Here we are again. What's for dinner? We want to eat. Where are our quarters? Here. In the field A field? - Here in the meadow. - In the open A field? Well, now you can curse and sleep all day.. but today at 5 pm there will be an inspection And will I check rifle beeches and barrels. Have you ever heard the like? Checking the rifle breeches? Our Assault Battalion will not look in the best light Well,well, it happens Now I would destroy any threat to sleep in Bavaria Well, you know This can all go to blazes. Hey, look Somehow they can still live and sing - Let's sing. - of course. As we always sing? "Germany is on the right track as never was before her radiance illuminates the east and west She stands like a mountain, guarding against the insidious and vicious enemies And like an eagle her spirit is high in the sky and we are keeping the flag flying and we are keeping the flag flying We keep our flag flying high Show all Show all our enemies that we stand for the truth how strong is our ancient camaraderie when you hear a battle cry So keep on, despite the storm and the storm So keep on, despite the storm and the storm In the furnace and the mud of Flanders Britain's hopes of winning in 1917 became bogged down On the Western Front in Winter in the last months of November the English break through with hundreds of tanks... Cambrai Christmas 1917. - Come on, get a move on - What is it? - It's already 6 am - it's 6 already? Carl is already on duty. He waits. Thanks. Wait, wait, wait Bread and this is to raise the alarm. Ah, a flaregun. Anxious? Today, on the eve of Christmas? Save a cup of punch for me It's a very special occasion and we have nothing special to drink Thanks. I think it is necessary to remember those who were with us last Christmas those who had been in our Assault Battalion O Lord, our corporal, was a great man and Fritz, old friend and Beni, and Fritz - And Ludwig - And Sepp Oh, God, those were the guys We have no soldiers. and we generally do not like to bother about winning Ohh, Where did you get that? "Stille Nacht, ... heilige Nacht Alles schl?ft; einsam wacht Nur das traute hochheilige Paar Paar Holder Knabe im lockigen Haar, Schlaf in himmlischer Ruh! Schlaf in himmlischer Ruh! Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht, ... " Get out! Grenade! Good. Let's get out of here! Come on! Out! Hurry here! He is here. Oh, my God. Someone is crying there. Hans! He is here. Slowly. Do not rush Get a medic here! Move. That's it. There is nothing more I can do. Come on, light the Christmas tree and rejoice. This is his last hour.
