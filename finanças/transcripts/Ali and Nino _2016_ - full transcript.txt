[SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] At the dawn of the Great War The Russian Empire ruled over more than 100 ethnic groups. The Caucasus Region supplier of 50% of the world's oil. The Land where East meets West. [WIND WHISTLING] [BUBBLING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [WOMAN CHUCKLES] But we did it yesterday. [HUMMING] [CHUCKLES] WOMAN: He said he loved it. I'm so glad he clapped, because if not it... would be... [SHEEP BLEATING] Father, I want to get married. You want me to find you a beautiful wife? I want to marry Nino Kipiani. Her hips are too slim, like all Georgians. Father! A woman's hips are more important than her education, my son. Remember that. When do you want to marry? Soon. I should like my grandson to be born in May. It is a lucky month. - Why did you choose her? - ALI: I love her, Father. FATHER: Generally speaking, loving a woman is not a good idea. ALI: [CHUCKLES] Father. [CARRIAGE RATTLING] [ENGINE HUMMING] MAN: Ali Khan, congratulations on graduating. It's a very well-deserved celebration for you. Will you be going on to study in Moscow? I haven't decided. May I ask you for this dance? Father? Certainly. [SHEEP BLEATING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] KIPIANI SUMMER RESIDENCE, TBILISI How much for the land, sir? How big is your domain? Well, sometimes I'm quite shy, but... [LAUGHS] No, no. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MALIK: May I? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. - I'm Malik Nakhararyan. - Oh. Nino Kipiani. - Pleasure to meet you. - Lovely to meet you. I'm a very good friend of your father. We are in business together. Oh. [CHUCKLES] Thank you. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: But we have to do that. After all, it's the supply, we have to control. MAN 2: Well, at least we try to. Prince Ali Khan, you are most welcome. I am so sorry, but my train was late. Not at all. Come and join us. - Welcome here. - Thank you. I have just learned of your ennoblement, Your Highness. My sincere congratulations. You are most kind. Thank you. Thank you. God is in our wine. It can do you no harm. Father, Ali Khan does not take alcohol. It's against his religion. On this occasion, I will make an exception so I can toast Prince Kipiani. Thank you, young man. - Prince Kipiani. - ALL: Prince Kipiani. You must go and look at our gardens after dinner, Ali Khan. We have the most beautiful ancient trees. Thank you, Your Highness, but I came to visit you, not your trees. [CHUCKLES] What, you have something against trees? Ali Khan is afraid of trees, Mr. Nakhararyan. Not exactly, but what others feel for trees, I feel for the desert. The desert? It's just scrub and sand. That's what I love about it, its simplicity. Maybe that's the difference between East and West. The desert asks for nothing, promises nothing... ...but the woods are full of questions. - Well... - Ali Khan. ...eagles come from the mountains... ...and tigers from the forest... ...but nothing... nothing comes from the desert. Lions and warriors come from the desert. [LIGHT LAUGHTER] Lions and warriors. And not to forget, the source of our wealth, our oil. [LAUGHTER] Ali Khan. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [LAUGHING] [LAUGHS] NINO: I'm so happy you came. ALI: I'm sorry I was late. NINO: I was getting worried. - Who was that man sitting next to you? - Malik? He's from a very important Armenian family. [CHUCKLES] Your father's a prince now. Does that make you a princess? It does. I think I love you, Ali Khan. Even though I'm a princess. Maybe you won't be one for very long. What do you mean? Don't you lose the title when you get married? Is that supposed to be a proposal? Yes. Will you always love me, Ali Khan? Yes. And will you stay with me, whatever happens... ...and take no other wives? Yes. Won't your father demand I become a Muslim? No. I've always wanted to go to Paris... ...more than anywhere in the world. I promise I will take you to Paris for our honeymoon. [CHUCKLES] Now... ...will you marry me? I will. I will, Ali. Khan. Khan. A telegram for you. 4th AUGUST 1914 MAN: My dear son, the czar has seen fit... ...to declare war on various European monarchs. Return at once to Baku and be ready to do your duty. Who's this war against? The German kaiser, the Austrian emperor... ...the king of Bavaria, the king of Prussia, the king of Hungary... - ...the sultan of the Ottoman Empire... - And who are Russia's allies? The king of England, the king of Serbia... ...the king of the Belgians, the president of the French Republic... ...and the emperor of Japan. [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] BAKU, AZERBAIJAN [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [MUEZZIN SINGING CALL TO PRAYER] SHIRVANSHIR PALACE ALI: I know, when our family ruled this country... ...how many of them fought and died on the battlefield. Your father, your grandfather. And I feel part of that. But why should I fight for one Christian monarch against another? Why should I fight for Russia's cause, whatever it may be? We've grown used to thinking of ourselves as part of Russia. We are not. They invaded us a hundred years ago and took away our family's power. We are an occupied country. Believe me, Father, I shall be proud to die in battle when the time comes. But this is not our fight. You're crazy. You mean you're going to pass up this wonderful opportunity? Ilyas, we're here... ...and the front line will be around here... ...2,000 miles away in Belgium. If we get to fight at all, it will most probably be against the Turks... ...our cousins, why should I want to do that? - For the glory. - Listen, do you care who wins this war? - No, not in the least. - [CHUCKLES] - You just want to fight. - Yes, I want to be a soldier. I've always wanted to be. I'm sorry, I don't understand. You'll be jealous when you see me in my officer's uniform, Ali. [CHUCKLES] I'm sure you'll both be brave officers, but why? It will be an adventure. That's the important thing. What do you think, Seyid? I'm with you. I don't think this war is any of our business. At least I won't have to go back to school. Oh! Beautiful. When will you go and see him? My father? ALI: Soon. [OIL RIGS WHIRRING, WORKERS CHATTERING] Your Excellency can assure the czar there will be no interruption... ...in the oil supply in the coming months. There is even scope for an increase. Prince Ali Khan. I'm afraid it has to be admitted that, regrettably... ...war is extremely good for business. ALI: As you may know, our family were rulers in this region for nearly 700 years. MAN: Yes. ALI: We have retained enough property in the city to make us financially secure. I don't doubt it. - So... - Yes? I have the honor to ask Your Highness' permission... ...to marry Princess Nino. [SIGHS] This is genuinely an honor, Ali Khan... ...not only for Nino but for our entire family. [SIGHS] However... ...I can't help feeling she's still rather young to marry... ...to say nothing of the differences in background and in, uh... ...religion. I'm... [SIGHS] Sure this is also of concern to your father. No. I've discussed it with him. Well, anyway... ...main thing is, the world has embarked on a terrible and unpredictable war. I think we should wait to see its outcome. Don't you agree? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [TIRES SCREECHING] - [HORSE NEIGHS] Ali Khan. Are you all right? What's the matter? ALI: How dare he? A hundred years ago, a Kipiani would have kissed my feet for such an opportunity. [SCOFFS] My father will laugh at me. - He didn't actually say no. - The end of the war. This war could go on for 20 years. - What will you do? - We'll run away together. You mean kidnap her? Well, I'm not against the idea. It's the traditional way to settle problems of this kind... ...but it should be the last resort, shouldn't it? I think... ...someone should explain to Prince Kipiani... ...what a wonderful marriage this would be... ...for all kinds of political and cultural reasons. Who is going to do that? I can. Leave it to me. Thank you. Why did you say the end of the war? I don't think there is any need... ...to rush into it. Everyone says it will be over by Christmas. But how do you know? Nobody knows how long it's going to last. I thought it would be good for you to have some thinking time. Why do I need thinking time? You'd rather just join his harem without thinking? But he said he's not gonna take any other wives. Nino, don't be so naive. Once they get what they want... ...men don't always remember their promises. [SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] A Georgian, an Azerbaijani, and an Armenian... ...three great Caucasian people. - Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. - My wife will tell it to you every minute. - Gregor, you're bad. - Tell him. Recite one now. Recite one of your poems now. - We have the same face. - Really? Oh, I don't think so. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ALI: What's happening in the war? The Germans have occupied Poland. Russians are advancing on Baghdad. It's all the same to us. Well, better than school, anyway. - We have horses. We have guns. - Can't you volunteer for the front? They won't take Muslim officers at the front in case we refuse to fire on other Muslims. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] And they're right. I don't want to kill my Turkish brothers. - Courtesy of the officers. - Pork chops for the boys. [LAUGHTER] You see the kind of thing we have to deal with? You were so right not to join up. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hello! - I'm gonna go. - Okay. Bye. - Salaam alaikum. - [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS] Is Malik making any progress? He's certainly trying hard enough. But my mother still calls you a wild Muslim. [CHUCKLES] I don't think anyone's ever called me wild before. I quite like that. I don't think she meant it as a compliment. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [MAN YELLS INDISTINCTLY] - [MAN COUGHS] [BLOW LANDS] - [WHIP CRACKS] - [MAN SCREAMS] I know your friends are serving in the army, Ali. But between you and me... ...I'm sorry the Russians are doing so well. Does it matter to us? It does. Because unless the Russians are defeated... ...we have no chance to achieve what our country most needs. And what is that? Our independence. My father thinks we have no chance of independence. I think he is wrong. [MARCHING FOOTSTEPS] MAN: [IN RUSSIAN] Left, left, one, two, three! [TELEPHONE RINGING] - ALI: Ali, it's me. - Any news? Malik's here. He's telling them that in this region... ...he thinks mixed marriages are the only way forward. - Is that so? - Yes. And I think... ...after the war, maybe, even more... ALI: All right. Maybe we can see each other later. - Mm-hmm? - Uh... ...more... - ...complicated, yeah. - Oh, hmm. - So I'll see you after the opera. - MALIK: I think it's time for us to go. - [WHISPERING] See you later. - WOMAN: Nino? Are you coming? Bye. [DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [GUNSHOT] If Russia takes Turkey and Persia, the czar has said... ...he will close our mosques and schools and abolish our languages. And yet the czar asks us for money. Why should we collaborate in the destruction of our own culture? All we can be sure of is that after the war... ...everything will be quite different. All the great powers will be weak and exhausted... ...but we will still have our strength... ...our money, and our oil. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could become the first democratic Muslim nation? [ALL MURMURING] I don't like the way he's trying to portray the czar. I agree with Fatali Khan. We should liberate ourselves. And I don't mean go back a hundred years ago... ...to the way it was before the Russians came. I mean, we should create a modern progressive country... ...and run it ourselves. [APPLAUSE] Thank you so much for agreeing to accompany me, Mr. Nakhararyan. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. It's my pleasure. [CHUCKLES] [SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Amir, you have to talk to the young people. They listen to you. [BOTH MURMURING INDISTINCTLY] NINO: It was a wonderful evening. Thank you. Wait. Wait. I like you. I really like you. Wha... what are you doing? We can leave the country together. We will get married in Moscow. - No. - Yeah. And then we'll go to London. No, no, no. Malik. What are you doing? Let me out. Stop the car! Malik! Let me out! [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] - [HORN BLARING] - Let me go! Let me go! NINO: Stop the car, Malik! Good to have your support. Thank you for inviting me, sir. Thank you, Fatali Khan. You conducted yourself very well, my son. MAN: Ali! Ali. [PANTING] - Nakhararyan has kidnapped Nino. - No, they were just going to the opera. No. He was trying to kiss her. Then he drove off with her. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] What do you think you're doing? You're gonna stay with me. - Let me go! You can't do this! - No! You can't go. You're mine now. I'm not gonna say it again. They were heading for the coast road. Maybe it's for the best.

No, he didn't. - He's dead. - [TAMAR SOBS] [GROANS] MAN: I have 40 men guarding the house. - You have to leave tonight. - Why? The Nakhararyans, they have put a price on your head. They are going to come looking for you. I am going to send you to our people in the mountains. How long do I have to stay away? A very long time. - Good evening. - Good evening. Would you like to sit? In the circumstances, Khan... ...I'm convinced... ...the only honorable solution is for them to marry. - It cannot be done, Prince. - Yes. It could be done tonight. Where is he? I believe he's gone to his uncle's in Persia. They have to marry. I'm sure you'll be able to find her some suitable husband. We both know that no one will marry her now. Thank you for coming. [MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC] [GROANS] [EXHALES FORCEFULLY] - What's this? - Hashish. It's good for the pain. And for the conscience. MAN: Ali. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SHEEP BLEATING] Kasi Mullah? This is Ali Khan Shirvanshir. He needs your protection. Follow me, Your Honor. [GROANS] Ali Khan. Ali Khan. I'm afraid he's very ill. No one is ill for long in Dagestan. I'm sorry. Really, I don't understand what you're saying. Prince Kipiani... ...out of respect for the Nakhararyan family... ...our community feels obliged to ask... ...that your daughter refrain from attending Mass... ...for the foreseeable future. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] I don't know what else I can do. Well, you'd better think of something. Look at her. Look at you. We can't go on like this. [WOLVES HOWLING] I don't want to go to Moscow. I'm afraid, on this occasion, we are not asking your opinion. - I refuse... - The arrangements have already been made. - Father, please. - No! It's quite obvious there's no future for you here. There is no future for me in Moscow. There is a chance not everyone there will have heard what happened. [SOMBER CHORAL MUSIC] [SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DOOR OPENS] My parents are sending me to Moscow tomorrow. Then it's your duty to obey them. Is it not? If you won't take me, I'll go on my own. [SHEEP BLEATING] [BIRDS CHIRPING, ROOSTERS CROWING] Nino? Yeah. Nino. How did you get here? Seyid Mustafa brought me. [SIGHS] I've missed you so much. [DOOR OPENS] Seyid. Go fetch the mullah and tell him I need to get married immediately. We don't need a mullah. I know how to conduct a marriage. I just need to prepare the papers. Good. In an hour's time, then. You really want to do this? Do you? Are you prepared to marry a fallen woman? Are you prepared to stay here? This hut? Won't you be bored? No. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What is your name? Ali Khan Shirvanshir. Son of Safar Khan. - Your religion? - Shia Muslim. What's your wish? To take this woman as my wife. What is your name? Princess Nino Kipiani. Your religion? - Georgian Orthodox. - What is your wish? To be this man's wife. Do you wish to retain your religion? Yes, I do. Please, sign here. What... what name should I sign? Your new name. [GENTLE MUSIC] [LAUGHS] [LAUGHTER] NINO: My dear parents, please don't worry about me. Ali and I are married, and everything has turned out for the best. Life is simple in the mountains. We raise chickens, and we grow our own vegetables. We work all day and play a full part in the life of the village. We have none of the comforts of the city. But I can honestly say... ...I have never been so happy in my life. With all my love, Nino. [SHEEP BLEATING] I need something warm. Something warm. Something warm. Oh. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] My father suggests we make our way to Sweden. Neutral country. Does he suggest how we might get there in the middle of a war? They pay no attention. When you write back... ...tell them we are living the way most people live in our country. And it makes sense. - [MAN SINGING OPERA ON GRAMOPHONE] - [CHUCKLES] [BOTH TRILLING] [TRILLS, CLICKS TONGUE] [LAUGHS] AUTUMN 1917 It belonged to Ali's mother. Thank you so much, Safar Khan. Thank you. Do you fetch the water from the well every morning, my child? Mm-hmm. And do you do all the cooking? Yes, I do. Thank you. SAFAR KHAN: I approve of your wife, Ali Khan... ...but... ...she is a very bad cook. Safar Khan, can I tempt you to some more? No, thank you. Delicious. I couldn't. - How's life in Baku? - All is much the same, except... ...the streets are rather chaotic because our Russian governor has run away. - Why would that be? - The czar abdicated. What? Yes. So the Russians have all left the city. And our soldiers are back from the front, released from their oath to the czar. But what about the Nakhararyans? The entire Nakhararyan family has fled to Moscow. And my family? I believe they have very sensibly gone to Tbilisi. Does that mean we can go back? I see no objection. NINO: We've been happy here. Do we have to leave? This is the best chance we'll ever have to take our independence. [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [HORSE NICKERS] Was it like this when you left? No. MAN: The revolution in Russia has caused chaos everywhere! The Russians may have gone, but we are still in danger. Brothers, come closer, please. I want to make the situation clear to you. Our town is surrounded by deserters from the czar's armies. They're going village to village killing everyone in their path. They've set fire to the oil fields and are almost upon us... ...desperate and resolved to loot and destroy our houses... ...rape our women. They outnumber us! And we have fewer weapons. I ask you to join us to defend our homes... ...and keep the enemy from our door! [LIGHT APPLAUSE] You're back just when we need you most. Ali Khan. - What happened to your eye? - Piece of Russian shrapnel. So one day fighting for the Russians... ...the next day fighting against them. At least they trained us. Come. We need to start preparing. The deserters will be here in a matter of hours. [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Please... ...take these instruments inside and sterilize them.

[MELANCHOLY MUSIC] NINO: It's been weeks since I've heard from you, Ali. I'm so lonely here. Please come for me. I'm afraid my state of mind can't be good for the baby. Promise you'll come as soon as you can. 28th MAY 1918 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - Fatali Khan. - Ali. - When did you get here? - This afternoon. The National Council have given me a job to do. What?

[EXCITING BRASS MUSIC] I declare the creation of a new sovereign nation. It will guarantee... ...civil and political rights to all its citizens... ...regardless of ethnic origin, religion, class, or gender. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [PEACOCK CALLING] NINO: I thought I'd lost you, Ali. I thought I'd be here for the rest of my life. When can we go home? Not yet. But when the baby's born, you'll be able to leave. I can't wait that long. I can't. I feel like a prisoner. I can't go out with you. I can't receive guests. I can't go out to Tehran because I'm not allowed to mix with unbelievers. Do you wonder I can't bear it here? And I can't stand that eunuch another day. He keeps wanting to paint my nails and shave all the hair off my body. I don't want to see him ever again. And I don't want to see you either. So please... ...please. [SIGHS] What's more important to you? Your wife and child... ...or your country? Ali Khan. - It's a girl. - It's a girl, Father. Next time, it will be a boy. [TENDER MUSIC] NINO: Hey. She's so beautiful. [CHUCKLES] I love you. I love you too. - ALI: Will you come and join us soon? - No. I have decided to stay here. But what will you find to do in Tehran? I don't know. I will probably marry again. You should come back when everything falls apart in Baku. What do you mean? I think you know what I mean. The war may be over, but our troubles are only just beginning. Have a safe journey, my son. - Good-bye, Father. - Good-bye, my son. SUMMER 1919 [BELLS TOLLING] [MUEZZIN SINGING CALL TO PRAYER] [BABY FUSSES] [SHUSHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Prime Minister.

I thought I'd make you deputy foreign minister. What do you think? Thank you, Prime Minister. I will do whatever you wish. Good. Then that's settled. We need to find a place to entertain our diplomatic guests... ...and I am told you're redecorating. Yes, the palace should be ready in two weeks. Any chance you could make that a week?

Ali, when you talked to the high commissioner... ...what did he say? He said the Treaty of Versailles is about to grant us full nationhood... ...and guarantee diplomatic recognition. - Hmm. - Thank you, darling. - To independence. - To independence. [GRAND ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [CROWD CHEERING] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHS] [WIND WHISTLING] AZERBAIJANI-RUSSIAN BORDER, SIX MONTHS LATER [INDISTINCT CHATTER] They were not exaggerating when they said 30,000 men. No. And I don't believe they're here for their health. They can't do anything. The Treaty of Versailles says that... By the look of them, I'd say not too many of them have read the Treaty of Versailles. No. The Russians aren't going to march here just like that. Besides, they've just signed a friendship treaty with us. - Then why are they massing on the border? - Maneuvers, they say. Why have they chosen the closest possible point to Baku for their maneuvers? They can be here in three hours. It's a bargaining ploy to get us to lower the oil price. I think they want it for free. I'm happy. I'm happy. - I have a wonderful girl. - She is a good girl. She is a good girl. Now I'll live forever, yes? - You'll give me one wish? - Tell me. - If I ask, you'll say yes? - Depends. I want you to come home to Tbilisi with us. - No. - But you have to. I want you to tell your husband to leave this place. It's not safe. This man Lenin said the revolution will not survive without Baku oil. They'll be coming for it. [SOMBER PIANO MUSIC] 28th APRIL 1920 [LAUGHS] Do you like it? [TELEPHONE RINGING] Come here.
