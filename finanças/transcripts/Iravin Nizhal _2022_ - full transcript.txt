[Radio] Before I sign off, I have to tell you... [Radio] Do not sacrifice your peace of mind for anybody or anything. Exorbitant interest rates! Nandu's immoral interest! Nandu's heinous loan mafia, they say! Just write what I tell you to. You don't get to be creative about my life. Nandu is not a bad guy, like you think. My life is despicable, unimaginable, just the worst... Nobody knows that. That's why I'm recording it. Listen, and write correctly henceforth. There's crores of rupees lying in my warehouse now. These film producers borrow money from me to make their movies. It's not that my father owns Warner Brothers or my grandfather owns MGM. For one frigging rupee, I got fucked in the ass. Yes. Yeah, it's recording. 'Spring water 5 paise per cup' I had nowhere to sleep so I came here, how could you do this? Son of a whore! For almost three months... ...they troubled me wherever I went. And then, I went early to the place where everyone goes at the end. 'Cremation Ground' Don't choke on your food. There's water by your feet. He's so hungry, he can't even hear me talking. I didn't know if should call them sister or brother. Like a mother, they fed me... for three days. Little brother... Little brother... Little brother, wake up. Here. Go sell this at the market. What is it? They call it 'ganja'. To me, it's my bread and butter. What if the police catch me? They'll ripen your bottom. That's when I understood that you get nothing for free. Sir, some stash? This is the stairway to heaven. Is this powder or ganja? Ganja, brother. I witnessed things well beyond my age. What are you gawking at? Brother, I've got some stash. You want some, Holy Man? Brother, I've got ganja. Get lost! The fake saint Paramananda is out of the prison. There's a rat amongst my men, revealing my secrets to him, to finish me. It's not just for me. The fake saint had a female rat, too. Nandu, open my door. It's stuck. Coming... Nandu, have you taken everything? I'm getting it, don't shout. - Hurry up. Water-- There you are. Hurry up... before somebody comes. It was that pregnant woman whom I killed. If you ask why--? What? Who? Come, dimwit! I knew you'd come. Got a gun to finish you off! Come for you, if you dare. I dare you, come on. It's either me or you now. Glory to Paramananda! Glory to Paramananda! Glory to Paramananda! Glory to Paramananda! [uttering gibberish] Thutha Mikitha Lakutha. What's that, Holiness? What's in the meaning? Just enjoy it. Not just the idol. Every word that came out of his mouth gave me goosebumps. Holiness, I am opening a new jewellery store. Please wish me with your blessed mouth. Cover my face. Glory to Paramananda! After the Guruji, Saintly Mother Premakumari was our all-in-all. Let there be bliss! Holiness, I wish to sell jack-fruit. Bring this jack-fruit out of your mouth and bless me, please. You have no idea what will come out of my mouth! Anything that comes from your mouth will be blissful. Take this fruit vendor out back and carefully ripen his dumb ass. Want a promotion? I'll grant your wish. - Consider it done. It's an arrest warrant. For which case? - We found 5 skulls in your Ashram. Count again, there will be 6. The fact that he wasn't shocked, shocked me. I need to change my pelvic armour. - What is that? My underwear! He was my God. I had laid down my life at his feet, considering it my shrine. If it upset me this much... imagine the Saintly Mother! That guy over there is watching us. - He's useless. I'll handle him. Make sure the case is solid. Everyone is venomous. Devotee! Prison is nothing but a wall in between. It has a board - 'Central Prison'. Does that board make this side of the wall heaven... ...and the other side hell? Every place my feet touch turn into heaven. Oh wow! May God bless you, my child. God, you've blessed me with your child! Lack of protection, it seems. Protect the treasure till my return. If you try to steal it, you'll become the 7th skull. Glory to Paramananda! Glory to Paramananda! Hell of a difference between everyone else's hunger and mine. What is Rani doing in there? The baby is crying. He's crying for milk. She can't nurse the baby all day. She must be busy. Rani, open up. Oh, no! Hurry up, brother. - Wait, wait... One of you women should go in first. Indira, don't just stand there. Go. Is that Rani? Looks like her husband killed her. Don't just stand and watch! Make way. - Oh, no! Selvam, what the hell is this? Oh, God. Rani! Oh, God... What happened to you? I suckled a dead body. Where the hell would I find my humanity? Rajabadhar killed his wife out of suspicion. I was so worried for this poor baby... Thank God! The people who adopted me took care of me like their own. With affection. For 6 - 7 years. When they finally had their own child, I became her living toy. Yes. They would put her on my back and make me crawl around. One fateful day, at the park... ...she accidentally fell. And that was it. 'Bloody orphan! Is this what we fed you for?' They hit me. I fled to the beach from there. Then the mounted police ravaged me... I sold ganja, formed my own gang, burgled and got locked up in a juvenile home. That's where I was asked for my father's name. And that made me think. Where is Rajabadhar's house? - Who? The guy who killed his wife 18 years ago and went to jail. You were a chaste woman. - Oh, the drunkard? You were a chaste woman. Rani... How could I have suspected you and killed you? Though I have served a jail sentence for it... ...my sins are still not washed away. It's because of that grief that I drown myself in alcohol. Dad? Dad... - Who is it? It's me, Nandu. - Looks like the landlord from 18 years ago. It feels like a flashback. How are you, Dad? You sold the house, didn't you? Are you still here to enjoy rent? Dad, I'm your son. Don't you recognise me? He's ours? Yes, Dad. Don't cry. The same mole! Dad! You fucking whore. My suspicions were true. She kept saying she liked the man of the house. And I thought... ...she meant me. But now I get it. She liked the man who owned this house. What are you saying, Dad? I'm saying you are not my son, you son of a whore. Buzz off. I smell money. Show me your pockets. Sit! Looks like you're richer than me. I'll keep it safe. - It's mine! How does it matter if I'm not your father? Let me be a friend. Want some booze? Our calendar, our street... were all named after you. I loved you to the core. But you turned out to be a whore. You did your hair, got dolled up and went out, you harlot. Come here, my green-eyed darling. Slender necked beauty. Come, my stiff-lipped baby. Listen... - What? Keep chappatis for me. Don't screw me over. Like your birth did. Don't keep talking about my birth. Am I responsible for my birth? You impotent--! Rajabadhar is dead! If not now, I won't get any food till his final rites tomorrow. This is me. Nandu... That bloody whiner would start lamenting now. Nandu, what are you doing? Your dad lays dead over there, and you are stuffing chappatis? Imagine the suffering he must have gone through to birth you. Come and look at him, man. Don't look from there. Come here and shed some tears. Father! Dad, you've left me orphaned. Dad, you said the house owner owed you ten thousand bucks. You said you had an affair with his wife. - Boy, stop it! If you want money, just ask me. Don't pimp my wife out for ten thousand bucks! Same mole! You're my father, aren't you? What? You didn't father me, but you did fuck my mother. Shell out the money. My dad's on his way out... Don't hesitate. Dad, your mouth stinks. Buzz off, woman. You can pay your final respects now. Twenty for five. Forty for ten. Come over and place your bets. Miss it and it's money down the drain. Come over and place your bets. Twenty for five. Forty for ten. Money for money. Place your bets. Miss it and it's mine. Come over and place your bets. Twenty for five... If you don't have love in your life, you'll find a partner. That was when I first saw my Lakshmi. If you're already married... - I'll get divorced? Shut up, fool. Don't ruin my business. If there is no love in your life... She was more peckable than all the other birds there. I don't see my birdie. Renu, move Balu and Saro inside. It's raining. It's raining men in your life. - Shut up! Nibble my finger... A pretty girl like you deserves the rainbow. For now, I got you this bow. Get a room! How did you know green was my favourite colour? It's obvious. They are shooting a Rajinikanth film. Sound! - Running. Start camera. - Rolling, sir. 32/2, Take 2. - Clap. Action! Cut, take okay. That was great. - All okay? That was great, sir. Sir, you have a duet with the lead actress. Of course, didn't expect a duet with you! Superstar! We love you! Everyone got their knees dislocated. And I got everything but my knees dislocated. Last month, Superstar Rajinikanth invited me as chief guest... ...for his new movie's audio launch. That's how famous I had become. But now I must pretend to be someone else, run and hide from the media. Every kid wants to become the next big movie star. But I wanted to become the next Dhana. He'd ride his metal horse with swag, as though he were Robert Clive. Even before brushing his teeth, while chugging down brandy... ...he'd lend 900 rupees to each shop. Then he'd brush his teeth, eat beef biriyani... ...and go sleep at some woman's house. He'd come back at sex-o-clock, fresh as a daisy. How is business? I heard your sister cramped her lips? All the shopkeepers paid him back 1000 rupees. Hundred rupees interest per shop. 236 shops in total. Do the math. Even a calculator would go dizzy. But it was more than just the money. People would bend over to greet him, just short of licking his legs, you know. And I like to call that kind of swag... 'Suggni'. Come here. You thought you could give me the slip? Before I died, I wanted to live like him just for a day... ...and maintain that for the rest of my life. And I like to call that kind of lifestyle... 'Suggni'. I am home alone. I never asked. Besides, the door is open. Let me close it. Don't touch me. Like this? Don't come closer. Can I brush against you? - I feel these strange sensations... Listen to me. Oh, she did it. My first kiss. Saroja Devi! Hey, Green Parrot. You always have something green on you. But I don't see anything now. N-A-N-D-U. Oh no, you misspelt my name. Oh, she's inked me in her heart. Saroja Devi! I thought you were all I'd ever get in my life. But I really lucked out! My sweet little donkey! Do you have any idea how I feel? Ouch! Nandu, can you give me ten thousand rupees? I wanted to give her the money right away. But I didn't have the money. So I decided to burgle again, and got caught a second time. This was how it felt the first time I touched her. Thunderstruck! Love is a very powerful thing. It made me a burglar again. Don't hit me, sir. It hurts. Screw you! Name? - Nandu. Age? - Fourteen. Father's name? That was the bell. Shut it and go to sleep. Saroja Devi gave me sleepless nights. The more I read the smut, my nerves started bulging out. After I got out of jail... I eagerly picked up earrings for Lakshmi... ...and went to her house to put it on her. You are thunder and lightning combined, babe. Is that so? Change your blouse hooks. They are poking me. You--! You said you loved me but now you're sleeping with another man? Aren't you ashamed? Aren't you ashamed to peep into someone's bedroom? His money has gone to your head. Be practical, Nandu. Had I married you... ...I'd have been crying all the time, unable to afford even a nose pin. The people in our hood have branded me his kept woman. But look at what I get to keep. There are greater things in the world than money. Sure... ...but it takes money to buy them all. You bonafide witch! ♪ What is this mess I am in?

All she had to do was look at me, smile at me, and touch me. And that was more than I could handle. But the moment that filthy woman dumped me for another man's money... Saroja Devi made a comeback to rock my nights. She told me, "Go to Andhra. You can find action and cheap booze." I went there to buy a drink... ...but I started brewing it myself. Give me a light. - [Telugu] One moment. [speaking Telugu] I should light up a Tamil guy's cigarettes? I hate my life. My heart had gone numb. Until I saw her. [humming devotional song] Chilakamma... [Telugu] Please show me the way, Lord. [Telugu] Can you convey my prayers to the generous almighty? [Chanting prayers] I'd just collect the offerings and eat outside the temple. I never set foot inside. But now, I'm performing penance inside the temple all the time. I never saw any holy being in there. But for her. [Telugu] Come and buy these flowers to offer to the Goddess. [Telugu] Ma'am, light this lamp. It will bring you good fortune. [Telugu] Please come. [Telugu] What's with her attitude? Finally, my Goddess noticed me. And I went for it. I thought giving her a silk saree would be a silky smooth move. Maybe she caught a whiff of the liquor money that paid for it. [Telugu] She is not an ordinary girl. [Telugu] She won't fall for these gifts. [Telugu] She is as divine as this Goddess. Bad makeup, but good advice. [singing devotional song] My small brain told me that she'd fall for a big gift. One sovereign gold. After wastage and making charges, it set me back 3388 rupees. This will work out. That smile was like a slap on my face. I wish she had actually slapped me instead. I started working hard for that work of art. [Telugu] Chilakamma, come here. [Telugu] Please mind the shop, I'll be right back. [Telugu] Okay. Greetings, ma'am. - Yeah, right! [Telugu] At this age, even donkeys look beautiful. You have transformed me. I never had anybody to call my own. Will you...? ...be there for me? I may not give you a life of luxury. But I will give you a life of dignity. [singing in Telugu] ♪ Are you an illusion? Are you a shadow? ♪ ♪ Would you unveil the truth To begin our sweet war of the night? ♪ ♪ Are you heartless?

"It's a shared bathroom with a hole in the door." "Those boys from the hostel are always ogling." ...she started complaining in Telugu. Men build monuments for their wives. I built a tin bathroom. We returned from Andhra and sought refuge at Rawther's house. I had considered women to be nothing more than flesh. With Chilakamma, when I... well... you know... Okay, let me not sugar-coat it. When I went to bed with Chilakamma... I remembered what the Andhra woman said about her being "divine". It sure felt that way. I wanted to cherish her like the treasure she was, and tried hard to find a job. But no one believed me. Without Allah's grace, you can't even get a call through! And you're in such a pitiful situation. Why don't you take over my petty shop? Take a 50,000 rupee loan and buy some provisions. God willing, you can pay the rent when you make a profit. My Chilakamma lit the inaugural lamp and Sister Fauziya opened my shop. Hello, Bhai. - Hello. Chilakamma, what's the hurry? Look at you smiling ear-to-ear. Watch your step. [Telugu] Dear... Yes, dear? What is it? Arputha... ...you're my mother born in the form of my daughter. I don't even know if it was milk or poison that I drank from my mother. Which is why my life is part-poison... ...and now, part-you. I don't care about anyone in this world. To be honest, I can't see anything in this world, except for you. I don't care if the whole world misunderstands me. If only you'd understand me, and come back to me... ...I will even come back from the dead. Please, Arputha. I can't miss you, sweetie. Because I love you. That's what you always said. How could you hate me now? Please. Listen... Make sure this video reaches her mother. Your wife is pregnant. Your business won't even cover the loan interest. Why don't you get into Hawala? Bhai, you don't know Chilakamma. If she knew I earned money through illegal means... I'm not asking you to earn for my wife. It's for your wife! I'm scared. I'm here for you. You just need to be careful, okay? Malik, unload the goods. Stop slacking. Get to work. Before I understood what "Hawala" meant, it was all over. I convinced Chilakamma that it was a license issue. What could I do? Bhai handled the case for me. The loan sharks threatened me and chased after me. I didn't know what to do. I thought I'd go back to Andhra with my wife. It's my Chilakamma's baby-shower today. Nandu, the loan-sharks have taken your wife away. What are you saying? Happy new year! Watch your step! Let a man sleep in peace! Brother, they shut down my shop. That's why I couldn't pay on time. I am here now. - Where is the money? Do what you want to me. Not my Chilakamma. [verse from Ramayana] Let go of me. You pray to all these Gods but you have no heart! What the hell, man? Let go of me. What have you done to her? She is my Goddess. And now she is just naked. If you don't pay up, my boys will handle her delivery. I'll kill you. Let her go. - Get lost, you son of a whore. Sir, please forgive me. She is pregnant. Sir, please tell them. Please tell them, sir. It is wrong to loan money for interest. It is just as wrong to not pay back. I couldn't do it, sir. - Poor thing. She looks like Goddess Sita on a pyre. Every second you delay, she will continue to burn. See, it's all about the point of view. From your point of view, they are the villains. But from my point of view, you are her villain. Hurry up with the money. You are still surrounded by brainwashed morons. So you're powerful, in jail or otherwise. Because people in power listen to your every word. Even if you land here with the army, you cannot match my lone pistol. Die at your hands? Never will I die at your hands. I ran. I run. And I will keep running. Hunger and poverty chased me all my life. Not just my friends, I begged every single person I saw. Rajagopal Iyer had set aside money for his daughter's wedding. He gave me 50,000 rupees of it. I went back to Rawther. He put together about 8,000 rupees. Peter gave me 20,000 rupees. I took the money to those wretched people... I had no words to console her. Nor did I know if she needed me to console her. Those guys did this to me. I was so furious, I would have beat them to death right there. The only reason I didn't do that was... ...I couldn't afford to end up in prison. What would become of my Chilakamma? To wash off the sins I just committed... I wished to be the reason behind her smile, till the end. But that smile of hers... ...showed me the fear of mortality. [Telugu] Come on, dear. [Telugu] What is this? [Telugu] Are you still thinking about that? [Telugu] Even I am over it. [Telugu] Today's my baby shower, right? [Telugu] Where are my bangles? Chila, it's all broken. [Telugu] Looks nice? [Telugu] Go and have a bath. [Telugu] I'll make dinner for you. [Telugu] Go on. [Telugu] Hurry up. It seems obvious now, but I didn't realize it then. Pretending to shut the door, she shut me out. I didn't know she was going to do that when I went for a bath. Did you see the way she looked at me? And I was taking a bath, oblivious to it all. Who will save my Chilakamma? Look. Look over there. [Telugu] Forgive me, my little one. [Telugu] Please forgive me, dear. [Telugu] I wanted to spend my life with you. - A pregnant woman! A pregnant woman! Poor thing. I've never prayed to God. She made a human out of me. She was my Goddess. Look at her. She is burning, look at her. Oh no! Chilakamma! Look at my Chilakamma. My tender, little flower... Who will save her? Come out, you idiot. Come out. Come out! Save her! Save Chilakamma! You are too late. Why were you bathing all this time? Chilakamma! Chilakamma... ♪ In the quest of divine enlightenment ♪ ♪ Your soul is bare naked ♪ ♪ It will vanquish the ego ♪ ♪ Your skill is sorcery ♪ ♪ It will conquer sin ♪ An enlightened bunch that had renounced everything. I came here seeking solace. But these deadly voices haunted me. You fucking scumbags! Why did you kill my Goddess? When people like me go to him with problems... ...he enchants us with his divine words and brainwashes us... ...to use as doormats till the very end. I went to him believing he was God, but he was the devil. This lady showering jasmine petals... This arrogant whore. Trusting this arrogant whore ruined my life. I could have just killed Chilakamma's murderers and gone to jail. I escaped one prison and ended up in another. Hello? Oh, no! When? Proceed with the rituals. I can't come now. I was supposed to perform my sister's last rites. Little brother, I admit to this shamelessly... After 40, we can't make a living in this dirty trade. To this day, you support me all because I fed you for a few days. May Lord Aravaan bless you with a long life. You must perform my last rites. [chanting incantations] All hail our Saintly Mother!

Didn't you get him a garland? - Next time. Come. You are asking for a 50 crore deal, but you look like a bloody school kid! Sit! Greetings, sir. Can I come in? Check this out. Catch it. How could you hit an old man - on his ass, no less? This guy here is my ass-istant. - Ass... as in? Greetings, boss. Greetings, boss. Greetings, boss. Greetings, boss. All those years ago I greeted you several times, but you ignored me. You point that out every day, boss. But your 'Suggni'... was superb. I must say, you too were an inspiration for my progress. But you did something bad. You took something that belonged to me. No, boss. Correct! The matter is, neither you, nor me... Nobody owns anybody. It doesn't matter who matters the matter. That's the matter. Are you wondering where I learned all this English? With money came everything. English, you, my Laksh-- --your Lakshmi. Last week, we f-ed right here. After I was done with her, she pleaded, "Tell me a way out." I said, "Turn left, then right, for the main road." But she didn't enjoy the joke. Her eyes were full of tears. What could I do? I tossed 4.5 lakhs rupees at her, after deducting tax, of course... ...and sent her packing. It's all in the game of... ...cricket! When the ball comes at you, you just lift your bat... ...and hit it out of the park. Press the button now. You are killing it, boss. When Dhana was the big buck, I was a mere penny. And now... ...he is just one of my many pennies. They will pay up if we give them a sound beating! Hello? Listen up. The boss is here. You had all better pay up. You know what he's like. He's a bloody lion! I don't deal in thousands anymore, but crores. Because I am this MLA's benami. Hi, Sindhu. Sindhu, my dirty little secret. Wear some non-stick lipstick. It smears on me. I need to go shopping. Get the car ready. For a sinner like me, Sindhu was a sin I couldn't get enough of. Greetings, boss. That makes it 20 crores. - Yes, boss. Some of these cinema folks are crooks. Never loan them money. And if you don't return my money... ...that will be the end of you. - I will pay you back, boss. Whether or not his party is in power, politicians can always get away with murder. If I don't pay these scumbags back, they will hang me. Like this mongrel who hanged to death with his entire family and screwed my life. And that's exactly what he told me when he begged for money. Sir, if you don't lend me money, I have no choice but to commit suicide. If I don't start shooting in two days... ...I'll lose face. Then I can't go on living. I swear on Anand, I'll pay it back. Who is Anand? - My only son. You swear on your son? Please don't hesitate. I'll be indebted to you for life. Everyone always says that when they're borrowing money. But during the film's release, you people accuse me of exorbitant interest rates. Definitely not, sir. No one's lending money, even against property. But you lend money without any collateral. Whatever your interest, I'll pay it. Believe me, sir. Dhana... - On it, boss. What's your film called? "Hold me, choke me." Say it with more expression. "Hold me, choke me." Where are you filming? - Near Parthasarathy temple. Her father is no more. Did you do a background check on them? I did a background check. Their family is well respected. She's been blessed with a good match. Lady, your husband borrowed money for your daughter's wedding ages ago. You're just looking for a groom? That was for our elder daughter's wedding. This is my second daugh-- - Why stop with just two? Long ago, since one Rajagopal Iyer helped me out... ...when your husband with the same name came to borrow from me... ...I lent money out of sentiment, without any document. But now you are screwing me over. I'll pay back as soon as I can. He just left us suddenly... Please don't leave. The groom is walking away! What does the groom do? He teaches short-hand writing. - No wonder he is short-tempered. A good son-in-law should stand by you when you need him. This guy will only get your daughter preg-- Is the idol from the shrine coming to serve me coffee? Wow, you are so pretty. I don't need the principle or the interest. I'll just bed your daught-- I mean, wed your daughter. Why are you glaring at me, dear? Sure, you are fair as cream, and I am dark as coffee... But without coffee-- Say another word, and I won't marry you. So you've fallen for me? Head over heels? I don't like you. - Good Lord! I don't like you at all. Then why did you agree? I don't want my mother to suffer any more. If I were to find a job and pay you back... ...I can't do it in one lifetime. You sabotaged our last hope at happiness. I do have one other option. I could choose to commit suicide. Or something equally bad. Like marry you. I have an equally valid point. It doesn't matter if money likes us. The real question is... do we like money? And we do. That's what matters. My grandfather always said, "Some sins are washed away in the Holy Ganges." "While some sins never wash away, even if the sinner is washed away." I see the newsflash of my death over and over again. This sin you've committed... ...it won't just affect you. It will affect my child too. You've already hurt her. Deeply. Arputha hates you to the core. She doesn't even wish to read your messages. Mommy... Please... - Mommy! Don't talk to him. He is the devil. A tiny drop of life sucked the poison out of my soul. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. But I have decided to bear with it. You sin for a living. With you, I decide to bear a sinless child. I will bear your child. You don't have to sneak around. I am nothing but compensation for unpaid debt. This is not the sound of wailing. This is the nagging voice that's going to devour you, bit by bit. You devil! No! The body you buried underground wasn't that of a crafty, cunning conjurer... ...but of a tender soul that had never laid eyes upon this Universe. - It was her! She made me do it! Nandu, you despicable man. No matter which planet you flee to... ...I will hunt you down and torment your every last cell till the end of time. Stop it. Let me get some sleep. Just a little. ♪ Is it my life That I see in front of me? ♪ ♪ Will my sins wash away In your smile? ♪ ♪ Red flowers shall bloom Under your feet ♪ ♪ Your love has turned Into my sky ♪ Arputha... Arputha... There, there. Where the hell are you? - I'm here. Where the hell were you? What happened? - Why is the baby crying? Babies cry. She could be hungry, or sleepy. No, my baby should never cry. The sound of a crying baby... ...it really bothers me. I think this baby is here to tell me something. Nobody knows where life is contained in the human body. But mine's right there. I want to live till the age of 100. Till she is 100 years old. After she becomes an old woman, and loses all her teeth... ...I want to kiss her toothless mouth. Look how beautiful my Arputha is! So beautiful! Look here, baby! As a father, I really like you. Second only to my father. What happened? The boys are downstairs. I am not used to romance. See, I'm sweating all over. Why are you sweating? I am only used to violence. You just said... ...you really like me as a father. In that case... ...I'd really like to become a father again. Why are you feeling so shy? Look here. You became a mother only because I raped you, right? Yes. I was no less an object to you than the bed you impregnated me on. Only after Arputha was conceived... ...did you even treat me like a living being. I wonder what magic she worked on your soul... your Arputha. ♪ A million moons shine Across the milky way ♪ ♪ They wait patiently Just to see your sinless face ♪ ♪ My world ♪ ♪ My god ♪ ♪ My redemption ♪ ♪ You are everything, my mother ♪ It's been 2 years, 4 months, and 18 days since Arputha was born. And I, as a human. Even if there was a multi-crore deal... ...I'd set it all aside and be home by 6. From feeding her meals, to washing her poop, I had to do it all. And I cherished it. Like a baby kangaroo, she always clung on to me. She had trouble sleeping that night. Just like me. How could she sleep, when her head was rested against a grave? For that woman was buried in my heart. There was so much buried in my heart. Some problems haunt you like a phantom. And some demons pose questions that you can never answer. I guess everybody has these inner demons. Get lost. How much longer will you torment me? You devil! The body you buried underground wasn't that of a crafty, cunning conjurer... ...but of a tender soul that had never laid eyes upon this Universe. Hello, mister! Who are you? Where are you? Why do you disturb my Baddy all the time? Do you even know who my Baddy is? A real Superman. He fought against The Hulk and Darkman! Isn't that why you are scared to face him directly? If you have the guts, come out and face me. I am not a little girl. I am stronger than Wonder Woman. Face me one-on-one. I'll sort you out. I dare you to come out. Arputha, who are you talking to? I was talking to the invisible man. Why is he torturing you? He is... He is nobody. How... ...do I... ...explain it? Don't feel bad, Baddy. I'll be your bodyguard. I love you, Baddy. I can't miss you. Every time Arputha called me Baddy instead of Daddy... ...it was a constant reminder of all my bad deeds. She couldn't pronounce 'Daddy'. Sheila? Kaali? Where is everyone? Kumuda... - I'm here. The party got over long ago. You could have cleaned up. - Right away. Is this for me? - No, it's for the horse! Why did you surprise me with a diamond necklace? Because you picked such a beautiful name. Thanks. I'll keep this safe in the locker. For your daughter's wedding. No. Why not? No. Have I done something wrong? Let's not do this any more. Tell me what's wrong. I feel bad. Today, I named my daughter Arputha. Isn't that a wonderful name? It is. I wish to give up at least one of my sins today. ♪ Kill your old self And be transformed ♪ ♪ Bequeath your bread To he who has none ♪ ♪ Donate your organs For the life of another ♪ ♪ And you will be immortal ♪ Little ones, aren't you close friends? Friendship shouldn't just be about games. You should motivate each other to study better. So that when you grow up... Anand, what do you want to study when you grow up? I won't study. I want to be an actor. I'm going to be a movie star. - And then? I'm going to become the Chief Minister. When you become a star... ...I will be the financier for your film, just like my Baddy. Anand was Arputha's close friend. He meant the world to her. Anand's father swore upon his son's life and borrowed money from me. But that coward couldn't pay it back... ...and committed suicide with his family... ...turning me into a walking corpse. Now I'm lugging around my corpse, trying to hide it. ♪ How could you cast a curse? ♪ ♪ How could you alter the course of fate? ♪ ♪ How could you wage a war of rage? ♪ ♪ How could you let passion quell reason? ♪ ♪ Don’t you sin, my heart Don’t face the wrath of the grim reaper ♪ Before we looted, you said we'd split it.

You promised to replace him as my male companion... ...and now you want to split the booty? You thought I was a weakling like you? You are the Saintly Mother, alright.

So you can imagine what I did to those loan sharks. When I had enough money, I buried that case too. I buried it.

Let me talk to Baddy. Stop! Why did you do this, Baddy? God will punish you. Anand was my friend. You killed Anand and his family, didn't you? I had nothing to do with it. No, it was you! Everyone at school says you killed them. That's a lie. Listen to me-- - No, Mommy. Don't talk to Baddy any more. I won't talk to him either. The very sight of you angers and irritates me. I'll live with Mommy. Arputha... - I hate you. I don't want to see you again. I am scared to be here. Let's go away somewhere, Mommy. It's been a week now. I don't know where they went. I used all my influence and looked everywhere. Poor Arputha. She was really affected by what happened to her friend's family. Arputha... I didn't commit that sin. I didn't. Even children born legitimately, and raised in the right environment... ...struggle to lead a straight life in this country. I am an illegitimate child. How do I explain that to you? My world turned dark. Though I begged and pleaded... ...I could never regain her old love. Even the sight of my shadow scares her, and she hides behind her mother. When she lay on my chest... ...my heart beat just for her. But she wouldn't have heard it. That's why she left me. And now I've lost my heart, and I don't know how to go on living. I am in agony. To make matters worse, the media breaks me repeatedly with their breaking news. Anand, his father - the producer, and his wife. The media says I'm responsible for their suicides. Even I'm disgusted to see my face all over the news. It's no surprise that Arputha hates me. The last time I saw her... Please don't come looking for us. We will never return, even if you die. When I got this heartbreaking message, I decided to come out here. I came here because... I wanted to kill him before I die. What? I can't hear you. I'm trying to record something, and this guy is ruining it! What? The police? Why are they coming here? We give them wads of cash, don't we? What? A new DC? He doesn't accept money? How do they know I'm here? I know it. One of you must have given them this number. No wonder they tracked me down. - [police] This is the Deputy Commissioner. [police] I request you to co-operate and surrender. [police] I assure you... you will be treated humanely. Bring them on. I am not scared of the police. The ex- Deputy Commissioner told me... "The media are ripping you apart, blaming you for their deaths..." "If I don't arrest you even now, the department will give me a tough time." "So please go to a hideout" And now they've replaced him with a new DC. This must be the fricking fake saint's handiwork. [police] We are facing a lot of pressure, so we have no choice but to arrest you. [police] We know you have a gun with you. My gun! I came here in search of peace after I lost Chilakamma. [police] Don't try to act smart. Now I've lost everything... I have no peace, and I'm running with no direction. These darn police sirens! Feels like the call of death. Enough! I've been hurt so often, I have more scars than skin. You've called at the right time. Paramananda, you parasite! You're coming for me, clueless that death will be at my hands. Yes. You are a bigger criminal than me, but you look like an absolute joker. Come. I am coming at you... ...and you are coming at me. This is your place. You know your way around. I'm the one going around in circles. A death sentence looms over me for a sin I didn't commit. This is where I buried the unborn child. No one knows about that sin. Except one son of a whore. And he's been after me since that day. I haven't been able to silence him. Once I shoot him to death... ...I will find peace. A crime ends with punishment. But is there an end to the guilt? So I have to... ...find atonement. My Arputha... She will love me again. Arputha... Arputha! Baddy, here I am. Baddy! Baddy! Baddy! Baddy... Baddy! I can't miss you. Because I love you. Arputha...
