Everything inspires me, sometimes I think see things others don't. Norman Foster If you look how Norman looks, always dressed a very particular kind of style. He reflects the qualities of his architecture very much, it has that sense of doing things precisely, carefully, considerably. But you also see there's something, about the architecture which is hard to read. How do you understand a building which is a black glass, curved screen? You don't quite know what's going on inside, and maybe that's Norman also. The first drawing I can remember making, was of an aircraft, and it was... it used the only knowledge of aircraft that I had first time, which was the model aircraft, with the high wing, the ribs, and the source of power was... you know, rubber, I mean strands of rubber, but this was on a herculean scale. You know, I was up there several storeys above the ground, with the joystick and the lever that would unleash these, you know, kilometers of rubber. turn this, I obviously had this fantasy that, you know, I was sitting there in control all of this great craft. I can remember the drawing very well, You can see all kinds of reasons why Norman, throughout his life has been so fascinated by flight. There is, of course, the beauty of a artifact, the way that the wind curves over an engine, the way that the revets bring together pieces of metal, there is also the sense of being in control and command. If he'd been taught to fly when he was is in the Royal Air Force, there's no question, but the world would've lost an architect, he would have become a pilot. Ascending a building like The Eiffel Tower, changed the way a lot of people thought of the world, they literally saw it in another perspective and that's reflected in the paintings. I think as an architect, if you're privileged to be able to enjoy that dimension of flight, to be able to see how awesome nature is and the forces of nature, to be able to fly vast distances at high speed with no engines or solar power and to be able to literally almost sniff out the rising air, the sinking air, and to remain aloft, but it's also about challenges, and it's the poetic dimension. It's... something I never tire of, never will. There's something that is nothing short of awe-inspiring. but the idea of a bridge marching forward through a landscape, on a series of giant legs the scale of skyscrapers. It even wiggles as you're driving across, so you can see how spectacular it looks. We forgotten the useful things could be this beautiful. Norman never stop drawing, he communicates in the most effictive way, through a sharp pencil and beautiful block of paper, in his car there are fresh note pads, and freshly sharpened pencils, just in case something comes to him. he is always drawing, drawing, drawing, drawing... it's his way he thinks it's his way he argues points, you can see the buildings take shape. His lines are very spare, but very expressive, in a very economical way, just like Norman. I think he is the most self motivated person, I've ever met, without a doubt. he has passions, he has a passion for architecture, he has a passion for skiing. langlaufen he has the passions for flying. which is, I mean, amazing. you know, I mean, you don't know, but he has a commercial pilot's license. He wants to conquer, which is conquer infirmity, conquer weakness, in the sense that he wants to show how far one can do through real power. I came from a sort of continental, [Richard Rogers Architect] mould-potted, slightly middle class, upper class, Norman really made it himself, I'm full of admiration for that, but it makes him very much know from the beginning, the way he is going to go. I remember, hearing bombers go over the house, in the middle of the night, with my mother, I remember, talking rationally, about you know, what kind of bomber it might be, and just breaking down into a flood of tears, just being absolutely, abjectly, terrified. [Norman Foster's first visit to his childhood home in 30 years, Manchester,UK] Norman was an only child, he was born in the mean streets of the Manchester, just after the great depression, Robert, his father, managed a pawnbroker shop, his mother Lily became a waitress, My voice had change from my father died, my father was a tenor, and somehow, you know, it's was some gift, impassing. I just found a new voice almost, and I was asking him about his father, and what he got from his father, and Norman said what he got from his father and his mother is work ethic. they worked and worked and worked, and he said the only thing was, he perhaps as a result of them working so hard, he hadn't got to know them as well as he would've liked. This is a very important room, isn't it? this is where you did those drawing that got you into university. yes. and when I was at university, I had a drawing board here, and this is where I did most my student work. One of the things that he did for the portfolio to get to the university, was to draw the view from his bedroom window. the view he had was of a railway line which went right past his window, at eye level, and he would've been out there, looking at those big black steam engines, rushing past, throwing out smoke and cinders. Under the track, there's a passageway that goes from Norman's street, which is humble, poor, you can smell the damp, but you go through this tunnel, under the railway, and you find yourself suddenly in a middle class suburb, with trees on the streets, and detached villas. And realise of course, that Norman, was on the wrong side of the tracks. I came from a background, where the only honorable work, if you like, was manual work. I moved up into of sort of a middle class world of guaranteed pension. all the security that my parents never had which they earned for me, so I was working in Manchester town hall. I find it, totally depressing, I mean I'd escaped at launch time I discovered architecture. I didn't know I was actually discovering architecture, it was only in afterwards, I realized it, I would, you know, I'd been looking at buildings. My escape route was a bicycle, to get me out of that environment, into other kinds of worlds. When he came out of the air force, he was lucky enough to be recommended to do a job working in a firm of architects. Not as a designer, but as an assistant to the guy that ran the building contracts, I plucked up courage to talk to the most junior person in the drawing office, and I remember challenging this guy and saying: What do you think of Frank Lloyd Wright? and Frank Lloyd Wright was one of my passions through the local library, of... you know like Le Corbusier and so on... so I then started to engage individuals in conversation, how do you become an architect? what you have to do? Well, you have to have a portfolio. how do you get an portfolio? wow!, I don't know, I mean it's drawings. So I'd be drawing out of the bedroom window, I'd be taking drawings home from beach shores, copying them in the evening, and then I thought I have to tell the boss, so I knocked on the door of John Beardshaw, said I just tell him I'm going to apply to be an architect. but you have to have a portfolio. I've got a portfolio. how can you have a portfolio? so I told him, you know I took his drawings home in the evening. so he said you had bring it in the next day, which I did. erm, and he said: you know, you're a square peg in a round hole, and give me an office, a T square, a book of graphics standards, and gave me a project: a house, so that was a turning point. The essence of Norman's architecture, is that design can make things work better, and it's a very optimistic belief, architecture can make your life feel better. On a small scale, it transformed his adolescent bedroom in the suburbs of Manchester, later, it could take him away from that narrow world and make almost anything possible. Architecture, I guess, for me is something that moves the spirit, it really works in terms of all the senses, in that sense is about the things that you can measure, that you can quantify, and if you like the spiritual dimension, which is rooted in all of the senses, and which you can't measure, but you know it's there, it moves you, it moves your spirits. [Old Yale University School of Architecture USA] This was the school of architecture unbelievably the same ceiling, the extraordinary staircase, difficult to imagine it, but very familiar. Yale in 1961, was still under the spell of modernism, Paul Rudolph, the dean, had been a student of Walter Gropius, founder of Bauhaus. And the fire of the modern movement was still alive, Yale was full of strong teachers, but it was dominated by Rudolph. He was the man who taught Foster how to draw like an architect, and even how to look like one. Rudolph also made him cry, he used the words "you don't care enough" to Norman, after he had been up all night, working on a project. Yale never had a kind of Ideology, and Rudolph was particularly good at, bringing out the best of every student, he was tough on them, he's famously tough and rigorous, but it is about bringing out what you wanted to do. Rudolph really encouraged Norman, he really pushed him, with most of us he pushed us, or you'd be out. But I think he pushed Norman more than anybody in our group, I think he saw things in Norman that most of us did not see then. I went on this building, I did a lot of drawing, on the perspectives, so if you just take a photogragh of those, I can show you an extraordinary drawing, which is probably about so big where I was drawing line after line after line. Also on the teaching staff was Serge Chermayeff, he wanted to make him think about communities, about how they worked, and he was the one who was pushing Norman, to thinking about how you design a whole world, a whole environment. Vincent Scully, the other great force of Yale, was a historian, whose passion about making architecture, come alive to his students. Vincent Scully and Rudolph were all very much about the visual, how you sort things, how you approach things how things unwound as you looked at them from different angles. Scully was the one who encouraged both Norman and Richard to drive across America, they went on pilgrimages to look at great architecture. As we drove into the city of Chicago, and my VW Buggy had one of those windows on the top, the whole crew,not Sue, but Richard and Norman, kept and it was freezing, I mean it was like snow everywhere, wanting the top to be open while we were driving so they could take photographs, of the oil derricks and the big things all around Chicago, going into the city. It was worth the idea, that they'd start a partnership one day was born Having been inspired initially by American architects, Foster has that then returned later in his career to remind Americans of lessons, that they gave the world originally but then subsequently forgot. So he's like many people of his generation, someone who admired America perhaps more than it deserved at the time, because... and he's a kind of more enthusiastic about America than the Americans are themselves, because America isn't quite... or maybe what Foster imagined it to be had romantic vision of America. Just going back, it's Manhattan, It's New York, It's the skyline, It's the city of towers. You think your skyscrapers, you know, it's New York. The good news is that we have a tower in New York, the bad news is that it's a very very small tower, amongst the most extraordinary collection of mega towers. And how do you make this tower have a presence, when it's physically so small. Scale in a way is the same thing as size, scale is a quantity of somewhat abstract proportions, it has, it bears a relationship at one level, to the body but it bears a bigger relationship to the imagination. The way if you like, the pyramids in Egypt do, they remain, whatever you do, you walk up them, you walk around them, they remain the scale they are, which is somehow bigger than what they really are. When the Hearst building was finished, I called Foster, the Mozart of Modernism, cause I thought that that conveyed the way his work seems, sort of lyrical, elegant and effortless, and just as we know with Motzart there was huge effort behind all that, but part of his genius, was to produce this finished piece of music. They didn't show the effort, they just seem to sort of dance perfectly through the air. well, Foster's buildings tend to do that, they don't show they're effort. The diagrid triangulation, not only produces something which is inherently stronger. we can go back in terms of antecedents: the bottomless, the full of bones, walless and those, aircrafts of the late 30s, structures in nature creatures, are triangulated. inherently stronger using 20% less steel, a good start in terms of the sustainablity story, especially when 80% of that is recycled steel. The Hearst tower is set up to be as green as possible but magically, it also manages to come up with a new geometry, that no New York skyscraper had ever tried before, the corners look as if they disolved into thin air. I like the building in New York, and I told him that, and he said it was too squat, and I said, no, that's wrong. I think the muscularity of that building, I like. I think it's a very good building. The trouble with so much sculpture is the larger it gets the worse it gets, and I think the architects understand how when something is put outside in the open air, it changes, the air eats into it, and it has to be richer, and it has to be altogether different, and I think all these things, we haven't even got the first base on, and architects know all about it. So we can learn from them on this, I'm fascinated by the work of artists. and relationship, between space and works of art. The synergy between... you know, a painting, a sculpture, a furniture, the way those come together, which is a kind of endless personal pursuit. Given my love of water, and stones, and mud, and raw materials, and also the fact that like the first time, human habitation, the first natural place, for people to live in was caves, you know, and Norman has chosen Neolithic artists to make his wipe Norman would have stayed in America, he was happy there, he felt at home there, he had a job in San Francisco, but he kept in touch with Richard Rogers, and the idea of forming a practise in London came up, when Richard got a project, Norman joined him, he could always go back if it didn't work. so Norman got back on plane, and flew back to Europe, to discover that Team 4 wasn't exactly this big professional office. It was actually in Norman and Wendy's flat, it was in a house, you know, in Hampstead Hill Gardens. I never forget it. And they used to have to reorganize the flat every morning to turn it from a flat into an office, of course if they were having a client to see them, you know, they had to do all sorts of things, you know... I remember that they had this enormous great white wooden box that covered the bed, and they used to put models on the box, you know... so it looked like a sort of display unit, it really was a scream! Team 4 was where Foster met his first wife Wendy, they worked with Richard Rogers and his first wife Sue, and also Georgie Walton, Wendy's sister. it was a short lived partnership that lasted only three years. Their first big job was the Reliance Controls Factory just outside Swindon, which was the first british hi-tech building. The Reliance Controls was the first really successful building, in terms that, it won the Financial Times Award, and we thought: "We've made it!" and The Enquirer got somebody want to know if they had to clean the floor in the factory, but I, so it didn't really made it. It was an extraordinary time, it was almost like a pop group in a way, where all the things that brought these individuals together eventually, had the seeds of the things, that would provoke them to go in their own directions, a relatively short period afterwards. Team 4 split up and it was time for new start, Norman and Wendy decided to stay in london, and together, they formed Foster Associates. If I think back to 1967, then really Foster and Partners was formed rather, it was at that time 2 people. My late wife Wendy and I, who formed Foster Associates. There are only two problems, first of all, we had no work, and there were no associates. Without the connections that architects need to get their first jobs, the one area in which Norman thought him might get a foretold, was by going into the uncharted territory of industial architecture. The Oleson building was first serious thing Foster built on his own. In those days, Britain was still divided between the workers and managers, they had separate entrances and facilities. Oleson stood out because it was trying to give the workers something which is as good as everyone else had, you could say it was a socially utopian project. The project for Fred Oleson became a turning point, in the sense that buildings like Willis Faber, IBM, the Sainsbury Centre, all visited that building that we did for Fred Oleson. The Willis Faber Office building in Ipswich looked a lot like a giant black glass grand piano. Foster took a radical approach to everything about it, how it looked, how it worked, the techniques used to build it, the comfort it offers its users, its reduced energy use. How do you give glamour to an office building? And in Willis Faber we sought to create a lifestyle, so it had a swimming pool, in a town which at that time, didn't have a public swimming pool, It had an atrium, it had plants, and part of that was the colour, and the shinny ceiling, which was a response in a way from some lessons, that I learnt on the Oleson building. I remember the first time walking up the stairway, and seing this ceiling and thinking, My God what happened? I thought it was a white ceiling, of course, it was a white ceiling, it was just sucking, the colour. So this ceiling was very subtle, I mean, extraordinary. I remember the first time ever, looking back and we wake on my ship and seeing all of the brightness, and the forms of that that's white, because it all consists of bubbles. and said, how many bubbles you are looking at! and I was in front I'm looking at fantastic numbers of bubbles, they come in this way, look, look at this whiteness all those bubbles, beautiful, beautiful bubbles, everyone of them. I say, I've been taught in school, not to be able to design, cause a bubble is a sphere, you have to use time. Buckminster Fuller was the last of the american eccentric geniuses. A messianic, even slightly odd figure, who run the world in his bow tie giving speeches to students, as never to be believed went on for at least 5 hours. Foster jumped to the chance to work with Fuller, and the two began a conversion, that never stopped until the day Fuller died. Fuller's big idea was to do more with less, to make the strongest structures, hitting the least amount of resources. he was a engineer, an architect, an ecologist who defied any label. in 1951, he coined the phrase 'Spaceship Earth', the very image of humanity floating on a fragile vessel, lost in the middle of space. I remember flying him to, in a helicopter, to the Sainsbury Centre, at University of East Anglia, and then we spent really quite a long time walking around the building, going back to the building, through the spaces, talking about it, and when he came back into the restaurant, he draw attention, to the way the sun had moved, the shadows had changed, then he turned around to me and said, how much does your building weigh, Norman? and of course, I didn't know the answer. How much does your building weigh? and even Norman was stunned into silence, but being Norman, a week later, he had the answer, 5,328 tons, most of which was lost in the invisible concrete substructure, In the course of finding out how much the building weighed, of course I realized the disproportioned amount of weight in the least attractive part of the building. It was interesting voyage of discovery. So in a way Bucky was always provoking, provoking himself, challenging himself, and challenging everybody around him. Some people would see Fuller as a impossible dreamer, with wild ideas about covering Manhattan with a dome. On one level, Norman seemed so different, He's an architect who seems to be the personification of the organized and the ordered, and it is clear that Fuller made a real mark on Norman, and I think the difference is that when Norman talks about covering the city with a dome, he believed he could do it. Technology is the art of making things, and high technology is performance, and this particular material is a high performance material. Norman Foster 1980 A 3 ft brick wall, it weighs about 0.5 ton, a concrete wall, 9 inches, air coverty, or 3 brick walls with air gaps in between, except that concrete has so many overtons. I mean it's really a unpleasant material, I mean you know,it stains in the wet, it attracts graffiti...and no wonder, it's an aggressive material, this is sandwich panel, nice and light, weighs about a few ounces, not half a ton, lets the light through, very beautifully, compare that with this concrete wall, half a ton of brick works, they've all the same performance. The Sainsbury Centre was a vision from another planet astounding optimistic view of what architecture could be it was like an elegant and refined machine, that had the classical precision of a Greek temple, sitting in a green landscape. It was built to house the art collection of Robert and Lisa Sainsbury, two remarkable patrons, who helped make Foster's career possible, The really good buildings come out of a strong dialogue between the architect and clients, and the more pressure the client puts on the architect in a creative way, I think the better the product. The work that Norman and the team did with the Sainsburys at the Sainsbury Centre, was neat picking and meticulous going into every issue, and I think it shows in the end product. The Sainsburys and Foster, developed a close personal relationship, they became something like surrogate parents. Finished in 1978, Robert Sainsbury called the centre, "The finest thing in his collection". If you could put the Sainsbury Centre next to HSBC, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong, you'll see the difference between a glider and a jumbo jet, they're both about forms of flight, about new ways of dealing with materials. The massive exposed structure, the diagonal braces, the bridge structure of the HSBC makes it a weighty building, one which is swollen towards the sky. It's powerful, it's dynamic, wether the Sainsbury Centre is calm, is floating. It was the first time that anybody outside America, made a skyscraper that looked like it wasn't just a copy of an American original. Everthing has to be brought into Hong Kong, they don't build buildings there, the materials, the skills and the expertise, of, historically has always been brought in from outside. and in our project we were very much encouraged to try and find whatever was the best and most appropriate throughout the whole world so we went off to America and Japan and Europe and everywhere to try and bring the best things at that moment in time for that project. What it taught us, really, was there is a big world out there. Norman went back to first principles, deconstructed the skyscraper and made his own rules. He put the structure on the outside, and moved the greatest and remarkables spaces. It was beautifully built, and it was a landmark, that became internationally recognized, the symbol for the bank, and its commitment to Hong Kong before the handover to China. We'd never done a tall building before, so we were hungry for the opportunity, but we also borrowed up to the hilt and we were taken massive risks, and I suppose in a way you're always taking risks, then we were gambling, if you like, with the bank, in the sense that if we had not won that competition, we probably wouldn't be having this conversion now, we would had gone bankrupt. Norman had come long way by the time that he finished the bank. He tranformed his life, he become a very successful, very visble architect. He had built an astonishing project in Hong Kong, which the world came to see. It was called the most expensive building the world had ever seen. He looked as he was at the top of his game, but just when things going so well, some bad thing began to happen, the financial position of the practice was seriously weakened with the end of the monthly fee coming in from Hong Kong to pay the overheads, there was a series of black fridays, he had to let people go, and he began to worry even about being able to survive. And about the same time, Wendy,who'd been so important to make the practise work, became sick. She had cancer, she died. It was a terrible time, what can seem absolutely tragic and devastating at the time. It still obviously has a tragic dimension, if many years later, you look back on it, but on the other hand, life has moved on, we've all moved on, um...and you have a better measure... of satisfaction, of friendship, of love... of... whatever. Many times. I think I need the silence, and it's not an escape, it's a kind of complementary activity. A time that is so completely absorbing, but there are other times, when you're cross-country skiing, when you're cycling, you can reflect and often I find solutions to designs. There are many dimensions to those pursuits, obviously they're about pleasure, but they are so inextricably linked with what I do as a designer. [Mclaren Technology Centre UK 2004] [Petronas University of Technology Malaysia 2004] [Millennium Bridge London 2000] [The Sage Gateshead UK 2004] Foster has become placeless, to quite an extraordinary extent. Rushes with bankruptcy had overshadowed many architect's careers. So once Foster had the chance to work outside of Britain, he saw building at global practise as the key to survival. Downturns on one continent, can be compensated for by booms on another, the experience of working on a world-wide scale, has transformed Foster and his work. You can see now that there's a certain level of impatience with the way the old Europe does things, he wants to bring home what he's learned. The approach is always to... to go there, and to experience it, and to live it, and to...erm.. If it's people you live with the people, you know, you take your own, human, cameras, they were... and there is no substitute for that. You know, Norman's always taught us that that you must do it, which one of the reasons was why he is always the first one, you know, on the sites. [Foster + Partners Headquarters London] It's not the building, and it's not the physicality of a studio, it's the philosophy, the way in which beyond my lifespan, that will move on, and have its own life. That I think is the most difficult designable, and the one I'm most proud of. It is a belief in a youth, in the energy of youth, in the optimism of youth, and in the end the ultimate test is, do you continue to attract the greatest young talent? and wonderfully, the average age of the company is the same now, as it was when we were 2 or 3 people in 1967, it's still early thirties, thirty two. It's thrown in the deepen, and I think that's what's, what's really interesting about this place, it is how they integrate you into the process, and everyone becomes part of that process, because the days, all of the projects, they're always a journey, start very... you know, about the brief and the client, there's never a stylistic, goal that comes from Norman, He doesn't say: "It should look like this, and we develop it for the next." Yes, it's a whole journey, it's constantly changing and developing. As a team, we've reinvented the genre, we've reinvented the airport, we've reinvented the nature of the high rise building, we reinvented the relationship of the old and new. In terms of...you know, how you create a new life-cycle for a historic building, keeping the best of its identity from the past, and perhaps all of us in one way or another, we invent ourselves in terms of changing circumstances, or from experience or knowledge or feeding off new challenges. Architecture is also about power, it creates the landmarks that cultures of very different kinds have used throughout history, to express who and what they are. Whether is, you know, the Golden gate or whether is Sydney harbour, the bridge becomes the symbol of the place, transcends the original function, and in that sense of things, that the way in which the Reichstag, For example, which is very much about creating the democratic forum, for a reunified Germany, has become not only the symbol of the city, but it has become the symbol of the nation. The capture of the Reichstag at end of World War II, was a defining image of Hitler's defeat. Its reconstruction by the british architect was recreate poweful symbol of reunification the very different democratic Germany. German radio has just announced that Hitler is dead Foster's original proposal for the Reichstag was a much larger structure, a giant roof saw directly across the top of what was left of the original building, in a kind of exorcism of Germany's tortured past. It was too expensive, and he was asked for something smaller, and a lot cheaper, there was also a demand for a symbolic memory of the dome that had been destroyed by the war. I remember saying, there is no way I'm going to be a party to recreating a symbol that was of the emperor past which was a symbol of authoritarian, you know, the kaiser would call the government, as and when he felt it was necessary, and instead, what we proposed something that would work with the ecology of the building, would work with the winds, would scoop air, would actually draw sun in, would have a shade, and would also celebrate the kind of processional route to the summit, for the many visitors, who would come to the cupola. The question for Foster is, do you restore the damage? do you take what's left of the old building and make it look new again? Or do show what's happened to that building? Do show its history? Do you keeping Russian soldiers sometimes obscene messages written on the stone? In Foster's view, of course you do, this is part of German history, you can't just wipe these things out. Daddy! Yep Where do we Yeah... But we need... um... Um... is this really hot water? It is actually very, very hot Does it scald? It's so hot. Let's see... Because I let it, like, three minutes. Really? going You think it's pretty hot? Yeah, because I let it three minutes going. Right To take the glass. Okay,can you put it into here? The water? Yeah All of it? -Hmm For what is this? To fill the boiler to put this out? It's full, I think we can say, categorically, it'smore than full. Okay, put this one down here. No, no, we need to put some fuel in there. And what fuel? It says the maximum three pieces. It's starting to smell, Hope it doesn't explode in our face. Why's... How can it explode? Little bit of experimentation is needed here. it's getting hot (Hiss) You can start to smell it Can you... I think the oil. Hey... Try that one too...try that one too! Ooo! What was that? Hey! Hey! Let's go! Yey! Mummy! Let it build up some steam, because it'll do the... Can we shake it? It's fantastic! look at that! Ever since he was a child, Norman's been fascinated by models, he makes them, he collects them. In his house, he has shelf after shelf of exclusively crafted model aircrafts and cars. And even as architecture becomes more and more a digital design process, models are a key part of its practise. As the computer started coming into the office, and obviously everybody works on computers now, you started to wonder whether the model shop will have a future, and we have the same people in the model shop, you kind of wonder how we would use models. What's interesting, although we can do incredibly convincing renderings, computer renderings of what spaces might be like, we're finding we're using more models than ever before. Models provide a physical, three dimensional crystallization of a design, they provide a tangible step in the process of making an idea into reality. [Great Court British Museum London, 2000] For Norman, it's not simply about seing how a building will look, it's a means of understanding what a full architecture experience will be, I believe that the infrastructure of spaces, connections, the public domain, the kind of urban glue that bind the buildings together, is more important than anyone building. [Trafalgar Square Redevelopment London, 2003] Also perhaps, you know, trying to reinvent concepts like an airport, in such a way that the experience of the airport will be uplifting, where really an airport is got to the point in terms of crowds, of security and so on, that is, you know, a kind of reviled building type. [Stansted Airport] UK,1991 If Hong Kong marked a point of departure in the evolution of the skyscraper, Stansted began a new phase in airport design. At Stansted the terminal was turned upside down, burying the machinery underground, and moved and transformed the rooftop into a giant umbrella, liberating travellers from the claustrophobic labyrinth of the traditional departure lounge. The Stansted breaks through to go a step further, with the more refined Chek Lap Kok Airport in Hong Kong. In China's Olympic year Foster's approach to Airport design, went even further with Beijing's new Terminal 3. I think this place is gonna become like a viewing platform. Well, well, well. You can see, you can see the entire building. Look, all of it. For the first time. You can actually see the aircraft here. You can see people getting on, getting off Incredible. and In here, you will just just see 40 aircraft on the site all lined up You can see the whole... I finally got the diagram, hahah You see whole thing here. The airport is the modern city gate, a symbolic national front door, reflecting the aspirations of a culture, but negotiating the terminals is a stressful, anxious exprience for most passengers. A good airport is one that's easy to understand, one that allows you to move through it without having to ask for directions or look for signs, it celebrates travel, other than makes the journey an ordeal If you can see an aircraft, the runway, and the sky beyond, you have natural orientation. It is a privilege to have this Airport in Beijing. It is the best I've ever seen. When I go through it, I look up and the natural light fills the space and I find that often, there is no need for artificial light It's an enclosed building but it's very smooth and comfortable and the natural light makes you feel as if you're outdoors As an artist, that's something that really touches me. China wanted the building would make a strong statement about their country's new place in the world. It's the largest building on the planet. Its architectural language is both contemporary and rooted in Chinese culture. This geometry of the roof is like an analogy of a kind of crouching lying dragon. It's very modest looking, but once you get inside is completely overwhelming, completely the opposite of this base that you would you imagine. Building Beijing's new Airport in just 4 years, was an astonishing achievement. Only made possible by a highly organized 50.000 strong workforce, they lived on the site, working 3 non-stop shifts around the clock, at one point, there were a hundred tower cranes on the site. I remember doing the competitions for the terminal 5, at Heathrow and we didn't win. A year and half later, we did the competition for Chek Lap Kok in Hong Kong, we won that competition. I went out, we built the buildings, the building operated for 7 years before Terminal 5 at Heathrow opened. So, that's how long things take in UK. We now have a tremendous amount to learn, from the best of those emerging economies, and the way in which they are thingking big, thinking strategically, taking bold initiatives. erm... examples of, in a way almost so obvious, I just wonder why it takes so long for the penny to drop. Realising huge complex projects under the most difficult circumstances is an achievement, that does not come without a cost. When Norman started, an office of 25 people was considered big, before the credit crunch Foster + Partner reached 1.400, its critics say, that being big, might make for more good buildings, but not so many brilliant ones. For Foster, a big office is a tool. It gives him the resources to play a part in the keys you face in an architect today, shaping the future of the city. For the first time in history, the planet has become majority urban, and the challenge for an ambitious architect is to go on being relevant in the face of such massive change, working at the scale of the individual building doesn't seem enough to make difference. Man for thousands of years, has actually lived in harmony with nature, it is just the last hundred years, or maybe 150 years, where you have this incredible organisation taking place. The farmer was very happy he would be working on his field, he would produce the food and feed his family, a very sustainable cycle. If all farmers suddenly move into the city, then you have a problem, and why, why is that happening? because this guy, would earn probably three times as much by selling peanuts at a traffic light, than he would by working in the fields. in a sort of remote district, and that's why the landscape, of many of the cities that we've been studying together, show so much of these informal street vendors, people who have to sort of adapt and respond, and the problem is, how do you feed all of these people? and how do you feed them with energy, with food, with all the stuff they need, gas, electricity, the way they move around, in their cars, in a sustainable way? We all have dreams and they come from television programmes, and we've got all these, you know, nice people poor, happy children, long driveway, if this is what you want, this is what you're going to get. In the west, the Industrial Revolution took 200 years. In China, this change would take place in just a few decades, so architects must not only plan cities, to address the way mankind is making the planet uninhabitable, they need do it quickly. Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, is an attempt to show how that might be done, in the 50 degree desert heat, it's a hugely ambitious plan for a carbon neutral city of a hundred thousand people. It is actually the idea of creating a Silicon Valley of clean tech, and as in Silicon Valley, the seed is a university, where you get the new knowledge, the new research, and then, companies settle around and benefit from the research. Masdar would combine homes with jobs, it would generate its own power, and treats its own waste, the materials and methods used in construction aim to maximize recycling, and minimise carbon foot prints. But at first glance, the project seems like something from a science fiction comic Norman read as a boy, but much of it is based on very traditional ideas that were abandoned or forgotten with the advent of cheap fossil fuels. Movement in the city will rely on a network of driverless electric vehicles, guided by invisible sensors, running across the city at ground level, while pedestrians walk on a deck above. If vehicles are going to become more efficient and driverless, and they're going to follow networks they're going to be programmable, Then you'd have to separate them from the human, because the human are unpredictable, and that's why the city is lifted, and that's going to be revolutionary for transportation. Put 50 billion dollars into focusing on a centre for renewable technologies, and spend oil money, which is there now, on it, you know with the foresight, thinking 20, 30 year down the line is unbelievable, erm...why aren't we doing that? will Masdar be the first carbon neutral city in the world? We don't know yet, if it works, it's a huge achievement, if it fails, it's a heroic failure. If we achieve zero waste, zero carbon, then that will be a kind of a miracle. The tragedy is that given the urgency of the situation, given what is at stake, which is literally a survival of the species. The thing I find inexplicable is that there is only one Masdar! You know, if there were 20 urban experiments, in terms of 20 cities happening around the planet now, one would be very, very critical and say why only 20? That is the shocking thing that is unbelievable. The big issues in terms of tackling all this together, can only be a political initiative, and I think that probably it will have to get almost to the point of absolute desperation, before everybody is forced to get their act together, and then, the agonising question will be, did everybody wake up in time or did they wake up too late? Norman's early career was a honeymoon, a love affair with the critics, because he produced work, which is photogenic, very fresh, very successful, and then of course, there always comes a moment when someone has to say: well, just a minute, haven't we seen this before? is this becoming overexposed? maybe he's trading water, maybe this is becoming self-parody, maybe a world end to end covered in fostrism is not such a great idea. It's not what you read in the press, is not about an award, is not about somebody saying 'well done', erm...sometimes, somebody will say, nice things about something you've done an,d in truth, you don't really think, you deserve it, other times, you don't win a competition, or you get a bad review, but you know yourself, if you've done justice to it, it really doesn't matter. Of course, we all love, we all love praise, so we're all vulnerable in that sense, we're all human. What on Earth is a man in his 70s, is doing pushing himself to the extremes of a cross-country marathon. It's painful to do it, once he was wearing the wrong kind of gloves, and he got Frostbite, it took him 6 months to recover, but he did it again the year after, and the year after that. It hurts, it's also a very isolated thing to do; yes you're surrounded by all the other people in the marathon, but you're alone in the physical determination, you have to finish. I suppose that I've until relatively recently been inmune from illness, so the idea of a hospital, or drugs, o an operation was a kind of alien concept. Ten years ago, I was diagnosised with cancer, that was pretty horrific, erm, that was probably the worst moment of my life, erm...one of the worst. erm...I remember struggling through the idea, struggling through the 48 hours, before I was kind of rushed to hospital Erm, I remember being told at the time, but I was fortunate because it could have been a heart attack, little was I to know that 2 years later, I'd have a heart attack. And the thing perhaps that really was important to me, was the idea of at the end of that 6 months. I would still be able to train for the cross-country skii marathon, and I was told by the doctor, forget it, you'll never do it in 6 months, you'll have relaxers, it'll take longer. The reality was I did to the day in 6 months, so I think that in some ways a state of denial, is perharps at times helpful. Having survived the operation, the chemotherapy, I remember the marathon afterwards, and then shortly after that, I had a check, and I remember coming back in a car from the airport, and wondering why the doctor hadn't called to give me the results of the check. So I called the doctor, we stopped the car, I got out, and he said: I've got bad news for you, and I remember saying, you know, what is that mean tell me the truth and he said you've got maximum 3 months to live, that I think was the worst moment ever. Like the many other challenges, Norman came through that health crisis. The constant thing about Norman is he will not stop, he will not get himself beaten down by things, he always pick himself up, he will always start again, and there is always another turn in the Foster's story. Everything is a fresh start, and I'd love to do every project that I've ever looked at, and have a second bite at it, because you can always go one step further, and if you can't go one step further, then it means that you haven't learned from what you've done before, and you're not sharp, then, it's time to say stop and do something else.
