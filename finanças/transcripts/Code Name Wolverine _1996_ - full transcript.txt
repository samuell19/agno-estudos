- He's rolling. - Okay, good. Give him lots of room. I'll be right out. Have a great time, Harry. Thanks. - Say hi to Monica. - Will do. Oh, listen, you'll keep an eye on the place for me. You bet. Send me a postcard from Rome. Oh, okay. Harry, it'll work out. You guys are too good together for it not to. Thanks. Looks like our bad guy's on his way to the airport. Copy. Clear. Good morning. Good morning. Here you go. Thanks. - Mister Gordini? - Yes. - Travelling alone today? - Yeah. Okay. Stop-over at Miami International. Final destination, Rome, Italy. - Luggage? - Two pieces. You have a change of carrier. You'll have to recheck them... in Miami for the international leg. Okay. Sorry. Okay, have a nice flight. Thanks. Momentito. I got him. Thanks for everything. Hey! - What's going on? - What's the hold up? It's okay. I got it. Here we go. - There he is! Daddy! - Joey! Hey, boy. Missed you. - Hi. - Hi, Harry. - How was your flight? - Good. We checked the bags through to Rome. Yeah? So, what's goin' on? Look. I thought that we weren't gonna bring one of those. Well, it's not that big of a deal, Harry. - and he really loves it. - Yeah? Let's go get my bags. Watch this. Hey, Joey. I think you've grown about this much in the last two months. Joey, hello? Hey. And see if you can find my bags. - There's two of 'em. - Sure. We just need to give him some time to get used to you again. Yeah, I know. How 'bout you? Oh, maybe. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. Every day. You know, about my job... I can learn to like it. That's optimistic. I just wanna be there for Joey. Honey, Joey would rather you came home once a week... from a job that you loved... as opposed to coming home every day from a job that makes you miserable. When you're happy, we're happy. Simple as that? - I don't think so. - Look, Harry... - I am going to try... - Dad, there's our suitcase! Joey, that looks like ours, but that one's got a white ribbon. Just keep lookin'. Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Down! Get down! Freeze! Down. Don't move. Adolfo Jones? The one and only. Gotcha. Hey. How'd you organize the extra seat? Conned a few people. You know me. I'm just glad we're together. Why didn't you just force it? And have Mister Jones sue me for damaging his property? No, we do this by the book. What the hell is this? What does it look like? Outside. The bastard pulled a switch on us. Look at him, grinning like a monkey. He didn't pull any switch. He's just as surprised as we were. What difference does it make? We're burned. We got zip. We got the mule on videotape loadin' the powder into that suitcase. Yeah? What powder? He walks. They all walk. Come on, gentlemen. I have a dinner engagement. I'd hate to keep the young lady waiting. Unlock him. Oh, no. You put 'em on, you take 'em off. Excuse me. Oh. I almost forgot. Hey, Joey... did you know that Grandpa Joe and Grandma Angela came from here? They came from an island actually called Sardinia. Remember I showed you on the map? Remember that? Sure. Sardinia. Like sardines. Well, anyway, we're gonna stay here in Rome for a couple of days... and then we're off to Sardinia. That's where we're diving? You got it, man. When I was a little boy... my father used to whip me... till I told the truth. So... again, Miguel... you checked the suitcase at L.A.X. And then what? No. That's enough! Please! With all due respect, sir they do this kind of thing every day. Successfully. Then some jerk comes down from Washington... to supervise and it all goes to hell. Alright, bottom line it for me. Adolfo Jones? I don't have him. I'll get him next time, I guess. Not good enough, John. Sir, you don't seem to understand... No, Agent Baines, I understand perfectly. You are going to nail Adolfo Jones. - Any questions? - Suppose I can't? I picked you personally for this one, John. Don't let me down. I'd hate to have to cut you from the team. You know what I mean? - Yes, sir. - Atta boy, John. Good hunting. I guess it wasn't his fault. Two identical suitcases? Both with white ribbon? Never happen. It happened. [Spanish] [Spanish] Are you certain? A million-to-one accident. Some lucky passenger walked off with the goods. I don't understand why you had to fly up here for this. Twenty kilos of 'Pura' wholesale at two hundred thou. I accept the responsibility. I'll pay the money. Tell my uncle, he knows I'm good for it. I wish it were that simple. Your uncle, Don Pablo, put you in charge of this shipment... for a reason. Who's your newest man? - Ramon, why? - Is he married? No. Venga! This is a new product, Ramon. Try it. Tell me what you think of it. You see, we do have a problem, Adolfo. It isn't Pura in that suitcase. It's something we've been working on for ten years. A symptom of some kind. I don't pretend to understand it. I'm not a scientist. But it's a concentrated form of Pura. One thousand times as powerful. Can you believe it? So... the merchandise in that suitcase... was not worth two hundred thousand dollars. It is worth two hundred million dollars! The fact that you are Don Pablo's nephew will not protect you. You seven days to recover the merchandise. You got a key for that, kiddo? What are you watching? I don't know. Did you bring my snorkel? Oh gosh. I think it's Italian P.B.S. Where is it? I want my snorkel. Hold on. I got it right here. Oh, no. Come on, you guys. We're gonna miss the whole day. Let's go. Come on. I'll race you to the elevator. Come on. Go! And this is the flight the mule was on. A hundred and fifty-eight passengers. And we are gonna trace every one. All we have workin' for us is Adolfo Jones' face... and his reaction. When we opened up that suitcase, he was more surprised than we were. The last thing he was expecting was diving gear. So, we guessing accidental switch. The mule just took the wrong bag off the carousel. John Q. Passenger's gonna be real surprised when he unpack his snorkel. Does he live in Miami or L.A.? Wait a second... wasn't there like two of everything? They were adult-size and kid-size. Damn it. I wish we still had that suitcase. Adolfo. "Manny's Surf, Venice, California" "Joey G" Let's go to L.A. "Gelato" That's ice cream. Gelato. Yep, and I think Mom is getting us some. You don't want any? The game stopped. Fix it? Well, later, okay? Here. Now I have a little surprise. Gelato? No. Here. What? Here, sit down for a second. You know what this is? This is the Coliseum. It's one of the greatest Roman buildings ever made. The gladiators fought here. - Mom! - Is this an exclusive boys' club... or are you lettin' girls in today? Well, I don't know. What's behind your back? A surprise. - Gelato? - Even better. Fruit. Fruit. A hundred and forty-nine checked out. Thank God for credit cards. Everybody got their luggage, no blue Samsonites. We're down to nine still missing. Two flew on to London. I got our boys down at the Embassy looking for 'em. Five live in L.A. Left phone messages, nothin' yet. - Sounds promising. - Yeah, neither has any kids. Know, the five from L.A. are the best bet. Four of them are one family, father, mother, two children. And the fifth one? Name, Harry Gordini, flew alone, no answer at his house. - Bye. - Take care. Come again. What's up man? You sell these, right? Yeah, I sold this one. But we're all out of stock. How old is your kid? Oh, no. I was just found it on the beach... and I was kinda hopin' to return it personal like, ya know? It has a name on it. Look. Joey G. I mean, maybe I thought you had some records on it. I mean, I really wanna give it back to the kid. Lemme ask you a question. What is it about me that makes you think... that I'm gonna believe this load of fourteen-carat crap? Damn. You see right through me, don't you? Alright, look. Mom was a total babe. I mean... she's divorced. I got that much out of her. So, I mean, I don't know. I just kinda was wondering... maybe you could get a name and address on it. Yeah, well... you know, honesty is the best policy. Let's see what we got here. "G?" You're in luck. We only sold one to a "G." And that is... Gordini, Harry Gordini? Oh, Gordini, that's great. You got a address on that? Harry and Monica ain't divorced. What you say, man, who the hell are you? What the hell is goin' on here? Is he asleep? Yeah. I'm just tired. Look, I'm not ready yet, okay? Sure it's not just jet lag? God, I hate hotels. I'll be better when we get to Sardinia, okay? I promise Good night. Night. Nobody's home. Can I help you? Roy Murdoch, federal investigator. Is this the Gordini residence, sir? Yeah, but nobody's home. Hey! Hello? Anyone here? John Baines. Forget everybody else. Gordini we're looking for. - How do you know? - Call it a hunch. Listen, his neighbor says Gordini's vacationing in Italy. He doesn't know where... but his college will know. I'll check there. College? Is he a student? Teacher. I'll call you back. Good work. Murdoch here. His name is Harry Gordini. We think he's in Italy. You have nice time in Roma, yes? - Yes, thank you. - Here you are. You're going home to America now? No, sardine place. We're going to Sardinia for two weeks. Oh, Sardinia, it's beautiful. [Italian] - Have a good journey, okay? - Grassy. We're sure he works here? Yeah. "Professor Gordini." According to these pay stubs. Hello. Hi. Can I help you? Oh, yeah, I hope so. Exactly, what kind of college is this? Criminology and law enforcement. Oh, I see. Well. I'm looking for Harry Gordini. I'm his insurance agent and I have some papers that I need... He's on vacation. He's on vacation. I see... You wouldn't happen to know where I can find him? Sure. You can find him at the Plaza Hotel in Rome. - Thank you. - Bye. Daddy... - Are we there yet? - Are we there yet? I'm hungry. Oh, yeah. Me, too. I can't wait for a big plate of sardines. Yuck! We're almost there, son. But first we gotta find their house. And then we're gonna feed your face. Then could we go diving? First thing in the morning. I promise, my man. How are we doin', honey? We are doing great. Come on, pumpkin head. Come here. Sweetheart, it's beautiful. It's just unbelievable. Yep. Well, I guess he wasn't that hungry. I guess not. How about you? I think we passed that grocery store in the village... and I think it was still open. You wanna get something to eat? Oh, yeah. I'm starving. But not for food. Not for food? Signore Jones, I presume. Marco. Welcome to Italy. Thank you for being here. There is a change of plan. Your party check out of his hotel. [Italian] I spoke to the hotel porters and money changed hands. The Gordini family flew to Sardinia for two weeks. I have already made reservations for us on the morning plane. We have good contacts there. They'll be found. Please give my compliments to Don Salvatore. By the way, when you spoke to the porter... - did you happen to find out... - The answer is yes. Signore Gordini does have a blue suitcase. Sweetheart, that's beautiful. Well, thank you. You know, it's great. Everybody in the village sounds like my grandparents. - I think we're home. - Come here and let me welcome you. Why don't we skip breakfast and go back to bed? Can we go diving now? You're not hungry? Not hungry? Didn't you hear? They have strict laws in Italy. No monkeys in the sea until they're well-fed. Look, Daddy made us a big, nice breakfast. Honey, I think I got the wrong keys. Not my department. There used to be a scuff by the handle here. I think that... I think we got the wrong bag. Dear, you have no idea how we women pity. You poor, pathetic, right-brained creatures. Hurry up, everything's gonna get cold. Thanks. - Where's my snorkel? - Just eat your breakfast, baby. Joey, don't worry about it, okay? I'll get you a new one. A better one, I promise. - Where is it? - We got the wrong suitcase, honey. Remember. Remember the guy at the carousel in Miami? But his case had a ribbon. I don't understand. We have been carrying this since Miami? I don't know. I mean, it's academic... how long we had it. But we have it now. Look, let's just get in a boat. We'll go a mile out and we'll dump it, Harry. - Let's just dump it. - We can't. - We have to turn it in. - To who, Harry, the police? We're in a foreign country. How are you going to explain it? I'll have to go back to Rome. - Where? - U.S. Embassy. They have D.E.A. people there. Let them deal with it. Look, Harry, it's dangerous. I don't think you should do it. Listen, I'll go over there. I'll drop it off. I'll take the first flight back. Just take me to the airport. - Just when things were starting... - Things are fine. We're fine, okay? This has got nothin' to do with us. You made it. How was L.A.? Check this out. Nice lookin' family. Oh, here. You weren't kidding, were you? And they don't give the Navy Cross out to just anybody. You notify the Roman police? Yeah, we'll be met. I asked them to hold the Gordinis for us. Let's just hope we get there before Adolfo Jones. Are you sure that was him at the college? Yeah. A woman there described him perfectly. He was there a half an hour ahead of me. Damn. Sweetheart, please be careful. You love me? Now and forever. Trust me, okay? Everything is fine. Everything is wonderful. I'll call you when it's over. - No mistakes. - No mistakes. Hey, here. Take care of your mom. Get in the front, baby. We have them. They're in a villa about one hour from here. I told you they wouldn't be so hard to find. Because this is a small community. Look. - Okay. - Yes. Mister Baines? Radio message for you. Thank you. What is it? The Gordinis have checked out of their hotel. Destination unknown. Could be a plus. If we can't find them, neither can Adolfo Jones. Can I help you, sir? Yes, I need to see a D.E.A. rep. You have one here, don't you? Can I ask what this is in reference to, sir? No, you can't. Corporal. Just take me to the D.E.A., please. - This way, sir. - Thank you. - Wait here, sir. - Thank you. I think maybe her husband's taking a nap. It's time for his wake-up call. Yeah. Vamos. You think it happened in Miami? - Most likely, yes. - We'll need some help on this. Julia, get me Bissell in Washington. Yeah of course, then try him at home, please. Scramble the call. Where are you staying in Rome? I'm not. I'm on the next flight back to Sardinia. I'm afraid I can't allow that. I don't remember asking your permission. I gave you my number at the villa... if you need me, you'll know how to reach me. Good day, sir. You're not going anywhere. Mister Gordini. Please, sit down. I can put a bullet in this Marine's head... and one in yours. I'm not gonna do that. I came here like a good citizen to do what's right. Now, you got the suitcase. So I'm no longer involved. End of story. Who are you? Sorry, Corporal. Who are you? Signore Baines. I'm Roy Murdoch. This is... Forgive me Agent Baines. I'm Commissario Della Cortese. Welcome to Rome. Well, yeah, send them right in. Hey. Roy Murdoch. - Is that really you? - How are ya, Gus? Long time. Meet John Baines. John's with C.I.A. NARCOG. And the Commissario Della Cortese. Oh, we're old friends. Como esta, Giovanni? This is incredible service. I only put in the call an hour ago. - Call? - For backup. You guys were already in Europe? We just landed. Backup for what? Well, for this, of course. - What? - Some guy walked in here... told me the darndest story you ever heard then walked out again. Hi, honey, it's me. I'm on the last flight back. - Can you pick me up? - Harry... - we have a problem. - What is it? Is it Joey? You just need to bring the suitcase back. - What are you talkin' about? - Bring the suitcase back... Bring the suitcase back, Harry. That's if you ever want to see your family alive again. - Who is this? - That's not important, Harry. Bring me my merchandise or they're dead. I understand. Now just talk to me... He really should be at his villa by now. It's ringing. Thanks. Do you have my merchandise? Hello? What? What? Adolfo Jones. How long? I don't know. Not long. About thirty minutes. I hope we're in time. There he is. Come on! Wait. Don't shoot! I'm on your side. From your wife's note... it looks like they were kidnapped about 6.00pm. There are at least four of them. How do you know that? Four different brands in the ashtray. Good eyes. Adolfo Jones doesn't smoke. So, there's at least five. Who the hell is Adolfo Jones? Since this is now a kidnapping, gentlemen... it is officially police matter. Fortunately or unfortunately, I have some experience in this field. Why unfortunately? On the mainland, a rescue might be possible. But, on the islands, these mountains have countless caves. Millions of places where to hide. If you bring in more men? No. A thousand men would make no difference. - Yes? - Really stupid, Gordini. Really stupid to bring in the cops. I didn't. They found me just like you did. I had nothing to do with it. That doesn't make any difference. The point is, I get my suitcase back, I send your wife and kid back alive. You play games with me, and I send 'em back one body part at a time! You got that? Tell Baines to get the merchandise sent over. And when it gets here, I'll call again. [Italian] No. Telefono cellulare. You understand, gentlemen... officially, I can't allow you to pay the ransom. It's against the law. Officially? Are you married, Detective? Do you have any children? Well, what are you waiting for? Call Rome. Now! Okay, done. But I don't like it. You don't like it? The ransom he's demanding is twenty kilos of contraband. I don't give a damn. We're talking about my wife and son here! What? - Your surname is Italian. I was... - If I spoke Italian? No, I'm third generation American. What's the point of all this? Hey, it's for your protection. I'm not the one who needs protecting. We'll finally get Jones' attention. Gordini, classified? Mister Gordini, what does this mean? What it says, I guess. Alright, you won't tell me, then we'll get some clout of Langley. Was that my merchandise arriving? - Yes. - Good. Alright, listen carefully. You, and you alone, are gonna bring the suitcase. - No deal. - What? Nothing happens till I hear my wife's voice. Okay. After I talk to her, then and only then... do we discuss the exchange. Stupid, man! You play these macho games... put your whole family in danger! Hey. I apologize. I had no right to... Look, Gordini, I won't pretend I know what you're going through. But I do have kids of my own and I know how I would feel if... I understand your anger. But we have to stay calm. Think clearly. I'm calm. I'm calm. You'll never find Jones without me. We'll see. Sir! Move. - Yes. - Okay. I have a recording your wife made a half hour ago. No recordings, I said. I wanna speak to my wife. Well, sue me, Harry. Harry, it's me, Monica. He told me your exact words were, "No deal until you heard my voice." I'm fine. We're both fine. Listen carefully, Harry. He told me to say this. Do not. Repeat, do not look for us. Where we are doesn't matter. We're safe for now. God, Harry, where, we should have dumped the suitcase. It's a mess. Look just do whatever they say, please. Oh, God, that's good advice, Harry. Take it. I'll call again at noon tomorrow. They're alive. You're a very lucky man. Could I hear that again? Listen carefully, Harry. He told me to say this. Do not, repeat, do not look for us. look for us. God, Harry, we should've dumped the suitcase. We should've dumped the suitcase. We'll just put it in a boat. We'll go a mile off shore... and we'll dump it. Okay, Harry? "Where we should have dumped the suitcase." We'll go a mile off shore and we'll dump it. Okay, Harry? But which one? Which one? Oh. Signore. Boon giorno. Agent Baines? Did you sleep? A little, not much. Where's Gordini? In the bathroom, I guess. No, I was just there. Still asleep then? We'll find him. Where can he go? He doesn't know this island. [Italian] [Italian] [Italian] [Italian] Okay, John... the officer you're supposed to see is from Harry's Navy squadron. An ON, officer. Excuse me. Are you the base intelligence officer? Here. You got some I.D.? Thank you for meeting with me, Commander. It wasn't voluntary, Mister Baines. The Admiral apparently owes your boss a favor. That's the only reason you're here. So let's get to it. Why do you want Gordini's records? I need to know who he is. What he's capable of. Yeah, Gordini's ex-Navy SEAL. He's capable of anything. SEAL? What is that? Underwater expert? Among other things. Lieutenant Harry Gordini's probably the most efficient killer... the U.S. Military ever produced. Where'd he get his Navy Cross? Kuwait City, night before Desert Storm. He lead his team ashore, ten men. They killed a total of fifty-two Iraqi soldiers. For what it's worth, that was the night he picked up... the code name "Wolverine." Know what a wolverine is, Mister Baines? A kind of badger? Same family. Basically, it doesn't know when to quit. Get in a fight with a wolverine and it doesn't end until it's dead. Or you're dead. And it especially gets cranky if you threaten its family. From what I understand, your mission is to capture this Jones character. If I was you. Mister Baines... I'd try to find him before Harry does. Thank you, Commander. Pleasure. This time read exactly what's written. Not one word more, you got me? Sit down. Harry, if you don't come to the phone he says he'll kill Joey. I believe him. Look, please listen... Where's it say, "look"? Where does it say "look"? Try again. Harry, if you don't come to the phone... he says he'll kill Joey. I believe him. Please listen to him and do what he says. Keep the engines warm. I'll be back by dawn. - Yes? - Baines, give me Gordini. Can't come to the phone right now. - What? - He's sick. He's in the John tossin' his lunch. Look, call back in a couple hours. Please. I'll call back at midnight. If he doesn't take the call, I'm gonna kill his kid. One down. Paco? Check it out, both of you. - Mom. - Quiet! Hey. Paco! Jorge! Daddy! Damn. What, did you see someone? My daddy's gonna whip your butt. - Joey, sit down... - One sound, you die. Shut up. Jorge? Your man dies now. Joey, baby, come over here. - Do you think you could untie me? - I'll try. Getting it? Go! Drop the gun. Drop the gun. Now! Drop it, or she's dead. Wait a minute. Slow it down. Listen to me, senor. If you drop that knife and let her go you will live this night. I'm gonna cut her. She's dead, man. It's okay, Joey. Take it easy. It's okay. Is he dead? Let's go home. Joey, come here. Come on. Come here. Everything's fine, okay? We're gonna walk away this time. Remember what I told you? When you have no choice. Yeah, Dad, I know. - Okay. - You were real brave, baby. Damn it, man. Where the hell have you been? Jeopardize the whole operation. Your wife and kids are probably dead. I'll go pack. I'm waiting. Jones had 'em on a yacht a couple of miles off-shore. I went aboard. Jones wasn't there, so I persuaded his men to release them. Oh, and they agreed, just like that? Harry can be incredibly persuasive. Where is the yacht now? It went away. [Italian] [Italian] A Coastguard helicopter sighted the motor yacht, Calypso... burned to the water-line. Calypso? I didn't see the name. Excuse me, gentlemen. I need to help my wife pack. Cute, Harry, but you blew it. If you had done things my way and made the suitcase trade... we'd've got them all. Including Jones. That suitcase? Baking powder. Tracking device, too. Well, I wasn't fooled by it. Why would he be? No, Baines, you want Jones. But you're gonna have to get him without me. Could I have a word, Harry? Just give me a minute, please. I got nothin' more to say to you, Baines. It's not over yet, Harry. Jones is pissed off big time. It's not safe for you to go home yet. Who said we're goin' home? I'll go get the boarding passes. We have people in Europe. Let me send a couple of men with you. I owe you that much, Harry. It's nothing personal, Baines. You seem like a nice guy. Please go away. Forget we ever met. Take your hands off my son. You okay? They're goin' to Venice. Have somebody meet 'em at the airport. Okay. Well, maybe we'll get lucky and Jones will show up. Maybe they'll get lucky and he won't. Excuse me. I'm cornin' through. Excuse me sir, can you just scooch on over... 'cause I need to get through here. Excuse me, ma'am, can you tell me. Could you, can you tell me where the flight to Milan is? You have to go out here. One gate up. - That way. - Thank you. Sweetheart, I know where our flight is. Come on. Where are we going? Hey, I promised you a dive on vacation, kiddo. That's what you're gonna get. - Alright! - Alright. What year was that? John. Sir. - What are you doing here? - I just arrived. Gus and I were just reliving old times, right, Gus? So... we lost Adolfo Jones? Again? I'm afraid so. Can we talk in here? By the way, what was all that about meeting with Gordinis in Venice? Didn't your man get there in time? Oh, he got there in time. They weren't on the plane. What? But... We saw them board. Officially, they were on the flight, boarding passes and all, but... - He's still in Rome. - Or he left on another flight. - I'll go check. - Car rentals, too. Yeah. Resumes for Mr. And Mrs. Gordini. She's ex-Secret Service? Two years White House detail. They say she's almost as good as he is, hand-to-hand. He taught a course at Quantico, that's how they met. She hung it up after they got married. He resigned after Desert Storm. Didn't give a reason. Maybe he got tired of killing people. Why are you here, sir? You could've sent these by fax. I've alerted Paris and London. You can draw up to six men from each station if you need them. D.C.I. goes to the Hill next week. Appropriations Sub-Committee meeting? I promised him somethin' big to impress them. I promised him Adolfo Jones. Now, I don't care how you do it. You have forty-eight hours. I will not use the Gordinis as bait. Well now, that's sort of academic, isn't it? Since you don't even know where they are? I'm at the Hasstler. Working out his demons? I hope so. He's gonna need to talk about this. And you're gonna need to encourage him. I guess. Look, Harry, the last time I checked... I was the person spending all of their time with him. So, trust me on this, okay? I'm with him now. Sweetheart, I'm sorry. Really. Oh. That wasn't fair. Are you okay? As long as you guys are safe. I'm fine. Enjoy Roma, signore. John! I got 'em! They rented a car in her name, paid cash. They haven't crossed any borders. Well, they're still in Italy. Well, that's something, I suppose. Your boss wants you to use 'em as bait, doesn't he? You're not gonna let him, are you? If I find Harry Gordini, I'll ask him if he wants to cooperate. And if he doesn't? Ever wonder why when you get your college diploma... they hand it to you like this? So you can see the head of the unemployment line. Hello? Yeah, it's Murdoch. They're still in Italy. Maximum of four hours driving time from Rome. "And if that mockin' bird don't sing" "Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring" "And if that diamond ring don't shine" "And if that valentine's not sweet" "Mama's gonna buy you a golden fleece" Close in. That's your target. Right there. We're clear, right? No accidents. And how accurate is this? Within fifty meters. Listen. Aren't you gonna be glad when we're home in our house... with two bedrooms? - What? - Stay here. Daddy. You and Mommy are naked. No commente. No comment. You heard? It's all over the morning news. - In Rome? - Of course. - Great, huh? - Jones knows exactly where we are. - I told you. - Come here. As long as Jones is loose your family's in danger. The first few, as you can see, were shot high. That was to give me time to get everybody down. The rest were never below window height. We were never in any real danger. See, this, my friend... wasn't Jones. Then who in the hell did this? I thought maybe you might know. Murdoch? The airport, maybe he put it in my son's backpack. In my son's backpack. But you don't know. Live on national television. Harry... will you work with me? Two guys out there fishing without bait? That's pretty funny, don't you think? We're the bait. By the way, I can't see anybody else. Well, good. There's six more agents within a hundred feet of us. If you can't spot 'em, neither will Jones. Are you sure this Adolfo guy will come after me? Oh, yeah. He has no choice. You've injured his pride. He'll come. Damn! - What? - Police chopper. Let me see. Della Cortese offered one. I said, no thanks, he'd scare Jones away. Obviously, he didn't get the message. I'll go radio him. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey, get out of the water! Come on! Get out of the water, now! Get out of the water! Get down! Daddy! Joey! Mommy! Joey! - Daddy! - Joe! Joey! No! Any more great ideas, Baines? They found the police chopper dumped about fifty miles north. Empty. Excuse me. Why don't you to go lay down for a little bit, honey? You haven't slept in a day and a half. Come on. Harry, I can't sleep. Come on. Just listen to me. Mrs. Gordini. Excuse me. Could I speak with you, please? Special sandwich for Mister Gordini. And look who's having a good time. Oh, he's fine. He's healthy. I wouldn't dream of hurting your son. I'm not a monster. All I want is my merchandise. Get it for me, Harry. And when you do, a simple exchange, the suitcase for your son. All you have. You don't trust me? Well, think about it, Gordini. If I had wanted to hurt you... I could have just poisoned your food. Good evening. I'm expected. Nash. Evidence pick-up. Nash. Right. Good evening. Monica Nash. Which way's your lock-up? - That way. - Thank you. Nash. Treasury. NARCOG sent you. Hell of an hour, Nash. Now, do you think they care about our sleep? Next time, Nash... tell 'em we've got regular hours here. No problem. Good night. What the hell? Stop that woman. Stop! Harry. Pull over. Pull over, Harry. Harry. Pull over! Theft of government property? Possession of contraband? I mean, you're looking at thirty years, at least. What the hell am I gonna do with you people? You use my computer, my password and my memo. Now, back at, they add that up, it looks like I'm on your side. Only shot I got to clear myself is to take you in. Now. But, I won't. So... like it or not... you've got yourself a new partner. We can live with that. Thank you. You're free to go. Goodnight. Okay, it's done, but I don't like it. Your objections are noted. For God sake Harry. If Jones decides to hit this place with twenty men, what's to stop him? He's not gonna do that. This is his last chance. One of you is a fool. I guess we'll find out which one. No mistakes. No mistakes. You waste no time, do you? So far, so good, Harry. One question though. What's stopping me from walking in there and taking the suitcase? Because you would never walk out again. Alright, 7.00am. Daddy! Hey, kid, get back over there now. Move back. Okay. And now Harry, you're dead. You're dead! Wolverine! You got it Harry. Now! You okay? Come on. Get up. Come on, now. Right. - How long has he been under? - Not long at all. Harry! - Is he dead? - He can be resuscitated. It's your choice. - Are you all right? Yeah. - Okay. This is why you wanted him? We need him, John. We need a spy inside the cartel. He's ours now. You're gonna be working with him. And what about the Gordinis? You're just determined to keep them at harm's way. I know. It's troubling, but every war has its casualties. Casualties? What? Where's he going with that suitcase? Oh no, you don't! - John. - No way! No way does he get his goods back. Agent Baines, butt out. - This is my call. - You can't be serious. Credibility, John. He's got to have credibility with his people. Oh, no. I would like cowboy over there to unlock them. Not in this lifetime. Unlock the man's handcuffs, John. Agent Baines, that's a direct order. Thank you, John. Oh, by the way, I'm really looking forward to working with you. We have a little ceremony around here for new members of the team. You son of a... Welcome aboard. I'll remember that. I promise. Nice throw. You didn't have to come out. Yes I did. I found something that belongs to you. I thought you might like it back. You didn't have to do that. Well, it was the least I could do for my old buddy, Wolverine. Hi, John. Hey, Monica. - How are you? Nice to see you. - Good to see you. So, what happened to Jones? Well, Jones is taking his suitcase back to his people. But don't worry. No way will any of that dope ever hit the streets. He's not in prison? Not yet. Not while he's working for us. But, we can protect you. Just pick a place. I already did.
