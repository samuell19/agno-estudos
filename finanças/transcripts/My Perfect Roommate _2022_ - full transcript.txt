Rule 1, we eat separately. In fact, wouldn't it be uncomfortable to sit at a table with a stranger? Rule 2, save electricity! Save water! Do you know saving is the best income? Rule 3, a personal space must be respected. Never intrude on the red line. Yellow is a common area. Your color is blue. Na Moon-hee Choi Woo-sung My Perfect Roommate Don't drag your suitcase.

Defecation not allowed I just can't imagine sharing the toilet with a man. I've lived alone all my life. I'm sorry. Sure. Room Sharing between elderly and student Grandchildren, my ass… Look at this. Grandmother knows art. Living room looks like Mondrian's job. - Shut up. - Seriously, how can you live like this? Ask another place to the city hall. - Do you see the main gate? - Yes. People queues about that far to replace me. Really? So it's cheaper than a studio? It has a window, twice bigger but cheaper. I have no choice. You silver spoon knows nothing. Would you stop laughing? It's so funny that you can't poo at home. Whatever. I have to dig with my dirt spoon. Again? I need at least $600 per month just for breathing.

Ah, okay. Clean the bathroom, it's your day off. Okay. Give me a moment. What's wrong? Why do you go to the toilet so often? I have irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable... what? Under the stress or psychological pressure. It's incurable. I guess I was so stressed out in the morning. It's so obvious you don't want to clean. Clean the bathroom! Turn the lever to the cold. Otherwise, the boiler will keep running. Thank you for cleaning this morning. You must be hungry going to the toilet so often. Have a breakfast. I'm fine, I can go to the convenience store. Come on, sit down. Try it. Okay, then. If you skip the meal, you will suffer when you're old. How do you eat usually? At a convenience store or school cafeteria. It's cheap. How much do you spend at a convenience store? Gimbap, cup ramen... About 4 dollars? Right? I'll make a proper meal for 5 dollars. What? Can you compare it to ramen? You can try it today and tell me. Why would you eat outside if you can eat at home? How is it? 5 dollars is cheap, right? The first day, it's on the house. Soup run for the elders Sorry, I'm late. Traffic was so heavy.

Her mom had an accident, she has to take care of her! Let's go! Hey! Come on. I won't go either. Hello, I'm Han Ji Woong. I'm sorry. Am I late? No, you're on time. I'm sorry for such short notice.

I guess she's busy. Why would you call her, who won't even come? She's about to meet her husband in heaven. How could she always be so cold? Do you still want to meet your husband in the afterlife? There will be a lot of other men! Look at her, she can't hold her smile. Why are we walking? Not going home? Actually, I... I'm living with a scary old lady. If she sees you, we might be kicked out! Jing! Let's help her. Almost there! Jing! Stay put. Be quiet! I told you what's going on. Come on, shut up! I heard a dog barking. What are you doing outside? It's nothing. What's that sound? Please, only for three days. So you brought the dog? - Yes. - What nonsense is this? At my house, without my permission! The owner needed help… How about me? I don't even like human being. But a dog? - For three days? - I'm sorry. No. Never. Hairs will be everywhere! I can't eat if I see one. I will clean by myself for the next week. And the dishes! Besides… What about pee and poo? He pees at the bathroom, hose little water on… It will smell! Bathroom cleaning for the whole week! I mean, the whole month! What about poo? He's really smart, poops only outside. I will take him out after school. How about when you're not around? I'll take him with me. You know you're being illogical. Yes. But the owner's mom had a car accident… Young man. If you look after someone else's life, your life will be miserable. Even so, we must help each other in this society. What? We all live together. People always need someone's help.

Do you have a blind date? - Here are your beers. - Thank you. Are you having a fun with your friends? I've been to pet cafe, but didn't know a pet pub. Pets are family. It's popular among pet owners. I love it. You are a good pet sitter, Ji Woong. What? Spam. So we're at the same age, shall we talk comfortably? Shall we? - Absolutely. - Choi Sung Jin. Didn't you say about meeting someone? He kept following me saying he had an appointment! Why do you speak in honorifics again? It's none of your business. I've never seen him putting a hair wax. - Whatever. - Look at your hair. Shut up, don't listen to him. Now we're friends, I can ask about Jing easily. Right? Right? Jing? Do you want a snack? Women's restroom Try this yogurt. Now we're friends.

This is my jurisdiction. Where is your manner? This is theft! I left for a few days but you can't take my boxes! They were on the road, first come, first serve! Look! These are from the pizza place, These are from the chicken place. Did I ever take yours? I don't even look at them. Stay away from my street! Spiteful, venomous. What a grumpy old woman. Great job. Here is your $12, wait. Here, $12 and 30 cents total. It's getting less. It's a hard time. The price keeps going down lately. It's crazy. I know. The world is getting harder. But what can we do? Life goes on! - Take care. - See you later. I was so stressed out preparing Scholastic Aptitude Test. Mom nagged "Do you think that's enough?" "You'll have fun at the university." She was sugarcoating it. She exactly sounds like my mom. How about you? I bet your parents were different seeing you live so hard. My family? No, just the same. They just try to take care of you. My dad calls me every day at 10 p.m. Dad, just let me have some fun. And that's my mom. She's like a cuckoo clock. Hey, I wish I can live alone like you. Where have you been? Out of cooking oil. Dinner? Soon. Where's everyone? 806 went home with her son, 301 has to put her grandson to sleep. You tell your son and grandchild to come. You miss them all the time! Few days ago, at dawn, I was so sick that I couldn't move. So I was struggling alone, then I called my son telling him to take me to the hospital. After a while, a doorbell rang. So I opened the door. It was a damn ambulance. My son called 911 to take me to the hospital. I understand. He's busy living his life but... But he gives you a lot of money. Money can't replace everything. Count your blessing. He gives you money, calls the ambulance. That's enough! I can't listen to your bragging anymore. What a temper. I was about to go inside. Wait for me! Brother. How did you find me? I'm nosy, I asked around. It's been a while, be nice to your friend. I'm totally broke. It's not like that. I came to see your face on the way to Min Chul. - Really? - Yes, you punk. If I go there, who knows when we meet again? Good for you. You'll save money if you work for a while. Yeah, right. You could've told me you will be late on the phone. It was on silent mode. Look at you. You're dating someone? What dating? No. Hey. It's too late already. Let's go to your place. No, grandmother hates it when people come. Why? I'm your friend. She just doesn't like it. All right, all right. Then I'll stay until the first train. Ji Woong. Reminds me the old time. Shut up. We still got it, dude. Still the same. What kind of dog eats an apple? And pumpkins too? Sure, it can prevent constipation and give vitamins. I envy you. You go to university in Seoul preparing for the future. You must work hard for Min Chul for a year. All right, smartass. Who are you? I'm friend of Ji Woong. I'm sorry! He was about to leave. What's wrong? Leave now. Before I call the police. What? Why are you making a fuss? Let's go. Why? Call the police! Come on, let's go. She treats me like a criminal! Put on your shoes. I'm so sorry, ma'am. I'll pay you back as soon as I get paid. I'm sorry. This and that, too. Okay, go. See you later. I'm so sorry, ma'am. It was outrageous. I'm sorry. He acted like he has no parents, is he your friend? Please don't talk too recklessly. Do you think he acted right? No, I don't. But all he did was use the bathroom. He wandered around a stranger's house! I know it's your house, but I'm living here too. What? What are you saying? What a thief! Now, your parents must be so obvious! Ma'am! I'll give you a few days, leave. I can't live with someone like you anymore! Yes, I will! Honestly, it was hard for me to bear your personality. I can't wash or defecate comfortably! How about eating? There aren't many people who can live with someone like you! If it was that hard, why did you hold it in? Fine! That's good! What is today's job? Leave me alone. So cranky. Is it Yoo Jin? Get lost. Love is never easy. It requires infinite dedication and patience, at last, there's love. You know nothing. Do I look so free to you? What kind of reaction is this? I saw you put wax on your hair. Come on, man. Let's freaking hang out! You've been an ass whole week. What? What is it? I said get lost. Even if it's not you, I only have back tackles in my life! Hey! What the hell she's doing? Get out of my way, old woman! Hold on. I just need to pick this up. Are you deaf? I'm busy! Almost done! Move! I said move! Dammit! Come on! Grandmother? You! - Seriously… - Hey, craphead! Who the hell are you? Who are you? What are you doing? What the heck are you doing? Crap, seriously. I'm telling you, this punk punched me first! What? Punk? Stop! What are you doing? Both of you! Sit down! Give me your identification. Young man, let's wrap up quietly. Call your parents, it's not a big deal. Call them. What's this? You don't have parents? I knew it. You orphan punk. He must have records. - You son of wench! - Stop! Both of you! Sit down! Sit! Mister. One more word, I'll put you in jail. Excuse me, sir? Yes? I... I live with him, Han Ji Woong. Han Ji Woong. Is that true? I live with her. Punk. No matter how shameful her job is! "I live with her"? To your grandmother! What? Looks like your grandmother took you after parents passed away! - It's not like that… - Shut up. Mister. You pushed her first in front of her grandson. You are so famous already. Look. You pushed old lady down in mud, swearing. You were on the camera. Oh my! Who holds in it when this happens to their grandmother? Seriously. Young man, let's eat together. Have a seat. I'm sorry about last night. I said awful things to you. I'm sorry. Let's eat. Are you alone? Yes. How? I've never met my parents. All right, let's eat. Where's Dae Hun? - Dae Hun? - Yes. What are you talking about? Did you give him money? - Yes. - Scumbag. Why didn't you call me? I trusted him. And I was in trouble. What trouble? Never mind, it's okay now. Call me if you were in trouble. Don't bear it alone. Okay? Okay. I've put some more for regulars, enjoy! Thank you. Roast pork restaurant We come here after every works, now we're regulars. Why? Are you sick of it? This was our dream since we were in the orphanage. Eating with family was the most envious thing. Today's house seemed to be a young guy's. Right. He was 28-year-old. I guess the end of a lonely life has nothing to do with age. By the way, what's up with you? You've never bowed before. I looked into his stuff and room, there was not much difference between my room. They didn't think their last would be like that. While doing this job, it makes me think a lot. People who leave this world alone, their last moment. If someone was there for them... Then, wouldn't they die feeling a little less fearful and painful? How's the pet sitting? You almost lived with Happy at an orphanage, and you ended up with dogs. I love dogs. We can understand each other without talking. What are you doing? I'm disappointed. I'm lower than dogs to you. Without talking, you can't read my mind? Don't be like that. Stop it. It's good. Nutritional supplements Take one for breakfast and dinner Hello, ma'am. Hello, ma'am. Where did you two get so friendly? - Just walking. - Walking? Unbelievable. Stop talking nonsense and go in. We're going on a picnic at the park tomorrow. Do you want to go with us? A picnic? Yes, before Hyung Seok joins the military. I'll visit on a break. You'd better! It's not far and really nice. Shall we? I have things to do. I'll help you, let's go after that. Then, shall we? Yes, good. Let's go. - Okay. - Let's go to the mart. See you guys tomorrow. Should I cook eggs? Just sit down. - I can do the spinach! - No, I got it. Well, you can try. Try not to burst it. That's good. You're good, Ji Woong. - Now this? - Yes. Ta-da! Finished. It's so good, ma'am! Did you bring any delicious food? No. Gimbap, fruits, cider. We have sandwiches! This old lady is so excited! Look at you, you're in trouble. - What trouble? - I told you. If a person changes, it's time to go. Go where? I can't afford to go anywhere. The Grim Reaper won't take you because you don't spend a money. We'll be right back. Where are you going? Buy something. They look happy to be on a picnic. He's good, right? Yes, he's pure. He is a little dark because he had been alone, but he's one pure kid. But Ji Hun came in… Ji Woong! Not Ji Hun. Whatever, Ji Hun, Ji Woong. It's same to me. You've changed. Sitting out here at this time. Have I? Let's come out and look around the world sometimes. That's not so bad. The park is big, right? The sunshine is nice. You're right. It's a road I passed every day, I felt it's irrelevant to me. But not today. I've heard about her from my grandmother. She used to be a really bright person. They went to the same university. My grandmother got married after she graduated, and Gum Bun went to Germany. They understand each other well without talking, I think that's why they are close. Let's go, they must be waiting for us. Yes. Here. They made it together. Try this. This is why I fake illness sometimes. Let's take a picture. Grandmother, shall we make a heart? A heart? Yes! Ready? Focus on here. More friendly, smile, 1, 2, 3! Do you want to see pictures of Jing? Look. So cute. - I miss him. - So cute, isn't he? "It's better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all." Excuse me? It's better to lose everything by making love than not loving. Understand? No, we're just friends. You're too soft. It's a habit to lose. You must win when you can. - Coffee bet, 1 point! - Cheeky. - Hello, professor. - Professor? I won! I finally won! You can't put up with it too much. You have to say what you must say. Ji Woong, I'm going to drink some coffee. Please take care of this. I'd love to drink coffee. Don't let them take advantage of you. Sorry. I was too harsh on you. Have some fun! That's how you gain more energy! - It's so good. - As expected, Han river is... So, what's your dream? I'd like to run a pet sitting business properly. An apartment? Yes, at the living space. For the last time, please lend me $500! How dare you. It's an emergency. Bullcrap, pay back the money you borrowed before. Ji Woong! What are these? I used to eat a long time ago, but I wonder if it tastes the same. Pannfisch. Sauerkraut. It's delicious! I was poor, I made it because it was cheap. I liked the taste. I forgot about it, but it suddenly came to mind. Go ahead, don't mind what an old lady says. I enjoyed the food. Stop, you don't need to anymore. No! I insist. So I can have more sometimes. Your food makes my stomach comfortable. Were you looking at the picture again? Yes. Since Hyung Seok left home, I feel so empty. I brought this because I thought you'd be acting pitiful. A porridge? Abalone porridge? It's not a bad idea to fake illness. A serious illness begins with the heart. Shake it off and go outside! Yes, nurse. Don't be absurd. I'm not. If it weren't for you, I would never see my grandson. It's a long time ago. Acute myocardial infarction? Golden time is an hour. How do ordinary people know that? You did because you were a nurse. Time flies when you look back. It feels like yesterday when we were a freshman. You mean it's time to leave. Okay! I'll stop, stay a little more! Sickness makes me recall old times. The porridge on the table is for you. No charge this time! What are you doing? I cleaned your room too. What's wrong? Why is this here? I don't know, what is it? Even with the evidence, do you deny it? Get out. Get out of my house, right now! Let's go to your place. What? What? Okay, I got it. Calm down, first. You pathetic son of wench! I said calm down. Ji Woong, calm down. Listen to me. Bullcrap! Give me my money back! I can't. Scumbag. I'll be locked up in jail without it. What? I needed money. So I committed fraud on the used market. What? - Min Chul. - Are you with him? - Yes. - What did he do, this time? I think we should pay back to the victims first. Yeah, I'll handle it, don't worry. Okay. I'm sorry. I must have been crazy. I'm sorry, ma'am. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. Right after high school, they said we're adults. They told us to leave because we were 20 years old. To where? How? Do you… Remember $5,000 you get when we went out? I thought it was freaking a lot. But while living in a small room, it disappeared quickly. That's why you did it? "Because you're an orphan." "Because you don't have any parents." Do you want to hear something like that? When we were in school, remember they looked at us even if a tiny eraser disappeared? You're a smartass, goes to university. You know nothing. It was the easiest way. They love a model student. They love an obedient child! You freaking loved to be loved. Must've been feeling so freaking good… University is the same. When my friends… ask me about my parents, I have nothing to say. Say about their moms, what does your dad do... I thought it would be different in university. But It's all the same. It's branded on us forever. An orphan. Hey. What's wrong with you? - Ji Woong, Come on. - Hey, guys. - Let's go. - No, let me go. It's a school! - Hey! - Let go of me. - You wacko! - I got to run. Listen guys. Let me tell you a funny story. Yes, go ahead. Do you know what I did on the day I took Scholastic Aptitude Test? After the exam, I went to my part-time job. Others were happy because exams are over. But I couldn't. We couldn't celebrate. We had to leave the orphanage. I don't have mom and dad! I'm alone! Generation pause? I'm not paused. I'm N. Because I have nothing. This is why he's an idiot. Why would you hide that for 2 years, you idiot. Yes, what's wrong with that? Ji Woong, it's not your fault that you grew up in an orphanage. Sung Jin, let's kidnap him during this summer vacation. - Call? - Call. Let's kidnap him and torture him. Don't let him work. You know he's going crazy if he can't work, right? I know, a workaholic is worse than an alcoholic. Hello? Rest in peace You'll be okay? See you later. What are you looking for? It's nothing. She should've given us in advance. What if there's none? Come on. What if the student who lived with my mom took it? Excuse me, sir. Most of them will burn. Please take things for remembering the deceased. Yes. Do you want to burn these pictures and frames? Yes, do it. Please take this frame. These are the pictures that your mother valued the most. Sir? How about this? Yes? Looking for this? Yes? Thank you, ma'am. It was right in front of us. She thought at least you would take it. She always missed the moment spent with you. I finally graduated from college, but my family was having a hard time. I went to Germany as a nurse. They gave me eight times more than a normal salary. Leaving my country, I worked in deathly agony. There, I met someone I loved. But turns out, he was a married man. Eventually, he abandoned me. I came back to my mother. My father spent my money drinking and cheating on mom. My mom died because of my father in exasperation and depression. I felt disillusioned. There was no one I can trust. I thought about killing myself, but I wasn't… brutal enough. That's why I'm still living. Alone. I've never waited for anyone. He's late. He should call if he's late. Young man? Concerned… Missing… A month after I was born I was abandoned at a church. Without knowing my name or birthday, I was sent to an orphanage. My birthday is the day I was abandoned at church. My family name is Han. Because the principal's last name is Han. The thing I hate the most is writing mom and dad's names and jobs. It's so hard for someone like me. Ji Woong. Do you want to live with me? As a family. A real family. It may not be enough for you but as your grandmother. To me, you are a university student, handsome, and my undeserved grandson. Why? You don't want to? I may not look like it, but I graduated University of Foreign Studies, majoring in German. The first family of Room Sharing Program Hi, nice to see you. Welcome!

I thought you already knew. Enjoy your meal. Don't be picky. I'll come again tomorrow. - Okay. - Good kids. I can't move because I'm not feeling well. With this medicine, I can put up with it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. Grandmother! Why don't you stop picking up boxes? I'm afraid there'll be another accident!
