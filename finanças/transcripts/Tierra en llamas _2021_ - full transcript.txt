I see you confused I see you with fear Fear is normal Fear is good Fear will be with us and can be our ally. What do you read here? Fear is OK, but insecurity is unacceptable. And here, the most important thing is... Did they put the salt blocks? Yes bro, very early they put everything. How many? I counted 220. Ready to ship them to the border. Let's get rolling because they're a lot. Okey I have to go because it's Nachito's birthday, are you going? Of course, no way I miss Lola's cake. See you there. You bet. I'll bring a gift to the nephew. He came against me with a huge rifle... look, this is small, it was bigger! A very big rifle, he pointed at me... so, I threw the saddle down on him... I knocked him down and pow! punch him! Pow, pow! His eyes popped out because of the punches I gave him. But wait! Two or three came after me... then, I took some stones and pow... pow to another... I remember that another came against me... I had no more stones so I grabbed a big stick... but wait Nachito... they were like a hundred over the hills... I was all surrounded, but when they saw that... when I gouged out his eyes with the punches with the saddle... they all fled. Like John Wick? No, I don't know him, I think he's not from here. But I really beat them all. I defeated more than 100. I think they're a bunch of lies. Of course not! No, no, no, of course they are not lies! Ask your dad, he was there. Cool it Miye! Why not a coffee first? The parties are cool, but lifting the whole mess is a bitch. That's right, the good thing is they're only once a year. What about the girl who was going to help you? What's her name? Olga Why didn't she come? I saw her yesterday and she told me she was coming. She must be fooling around with her boyfriend. Miye, You always with your mind so filthy. Positive, you mean. You are so uptight, "Sister" Marilu. How long has it been since you get laid? Miye! What do you care? You don't even remember, see? Of course I do. When? Well... the last time. You don't know what you're missing, you silly. Isn't that right, Lola? Well, it's my problem. I'll do it till I get married By then, you'll have everything rotten. You are so vulgar! Let's go. Hurry up boys, you're gonna be late. Please. Don't be dirty, don't do that! Didn't you tell me to hurry up? Mom, why do some eggs have chicken in it and some don't? 'Cause some times chickens lay eggs for us to eat... and other times for them to have little children. And how does the hen know how to put which or which? Hey dumb, when the rooster gets on the hen, the egg comes with chicken. Why mom? Well... mmm... let's move, or you're gonna get late. I got chubby. But very pretty. Let's go, let's go. Nachito, where's your jacket? I'm not cold mom. Children, I'll wait for you at 1:30 at the entrance... I don't want to go look for you inside, okey? Mrs. Doña Lupe, what are you doing here? Olga didn't sleep at home, I wanted to see if she'd stayed with you. She didn't come yesterday, Doña Lupe. What!?, She told me she was coming here. We were waiting for her but she never came. Oh God, where she can be? Maybe with a relative, an aunt, a friend... I don't know, I don't know. Well, I have to drop the children at school, but don't worry... In a while, I'll go to check on Olga. - Lety, good morning. - Good morning commander. - I come to see Don Ruben. - Sure, come in. Thank you. What happened? It was a massacre, Sir. Twenty young men, shot at close range. Abducted women, summary executions... What's going on in this town, Commander? I think I have the answer, Don Rubén. The authors left their signature at the rehabilitation centre. The Masiaca?! Most of the boys worked for the Padilla. In a few more days they would finish their reintegration course. This is all my fault. Excuse me? A recklessness of mine... has caused all this misfortune. What do you say, Don Ruben? I proposed a strategy to end the Padilla's Let's make them believe it's a rival cartel... which is killing their men. But I never considered the consequences. The only thing we got... was to create a mess. And now, those bastards are coming to get revenge. But, there's no one left in Los Padilla, Sir. They come to recover what the Padillas took from them. They don't give a shit who's in their place. I have heard that the Masiaca... have dedicated every day to become stronger. Have been recruiting the most violent and bloodthirsty thugs in the region. We end up with a plague but we're getting a worse one. I will prevent and prepare all men, Sir. I don't like being pessimist... but I think we're gonna need more than that. We better warn the state police. Yes Sir. Excuse me. - Yes Lety - The State Attorney is on line. - Put him on - Yes Sir. I'm sure you're already aware. Of course I am. I hope it was just a settling of scores. And this problem ends there. I don't think it's going to be that easy, Tomás. Something big is coming on us. And the high command must be prepared. They surely have us in their sights. Mainly to you, as the state attorney that you are. I feel you so paranoid, Ruben, and you're not like that. I already had the Padilla's experience and I know what I'm talking about. We better be careful. I understand Ruben, but I think you're overreacting. These are just a bunch of starving thugs. On the other hand, the Padillas were a true organization You and your boys managed to take them down. And all the accomplices they had. That work was done by the Montoya along with the other boys. I was just in the way. They were just dragging me from one place to another But this Masiaca... We cannot be complacent. I have heard a lot about them. Don't worry Ruben, we'll take care. Let's go José, to Mr. Governor's country house. - That guy have a gun. - Where? Someone has being shot! Gee!...he fucked him! What the fuck man! They fled! Lety, I'm going to the livestock union. Okey Don Ruben. Now what. Why such a fuss? What's up, guys? Hi Don Ruben, there was a shooting, Sir Somebody hurt? Yes Sir, Tomas Rubio and his guard were shot. - Tomás Rubio? - Yes Sir, the State Attorney. Are you feeling well, Sir? Yes, yes, I'm okey, thank you... let's go. What happened, Rogelio? Good afternoon Don Ruben, sorry to bother you, but... We need you to watch a video which is all over social media. I just send it to your phone. Thank you. Please pull over. Everybody listen to me The time has come to recover everything the Padillas took from us. And the whole bunch of crooks who worked for them. What happened yesterday at the Rehab Center was the first warning. What happened today, is to let you know who's in charge here from now on. My brother was tortured. And Julio Padilla shot him in the head with this gun. But the real culprits were the Montoya brothers And their little hunting party. They blamed us for something we never did. We know who you are, and we're going after you. We have to change all the line. Yes bro, I already talked with Juan, he'll come to see that tomorrow. What's up Don Ruben, how you doing? Nacho, I need you to get the boys together, I need to see you, but right now. Okey, we can met in my house at seven. No, no, no, not in your house, come to my office. Okey, see you there. Now what, what does he want? He want to see us right now. I don't know, I heard him very upset. What is wrong with him. I have to change my clothes, they smell like shit. Yeah... you're going to meet the president. - I already miss you guys! - I was bored without you! - Don Ruben, how are you? - I'm okey. - Good afternoon. - Hi Don Ruben, how are you. Where were you? Where have you been? How are you Don Ruben? - Fine - That's good. I realize you haven't heard nothing yet. What happened? Sit down. I wonder if you've heard the news... about what had happened in the last few hours. No, I've been working the ranch all the time. Me too, Don Ruben. I don't watch the news. I heard something in the hotel about some deaths. Well... A new war has been unleashed in the region. What? War? How's that, Don Ruben? With whom? With the Masiacas The Masiacas?! With the Masiacas. Before yesterday, they killed 20 young men who worked for the Padillas... who were in rehabilitation. Most were "hawks" and small-time drug dealers. The Masiacas probably wanted to take them to work with them... and they refused. And just a little while... they just shot the State Attorney. Oh shit! Fuck it. Son of a bitch. The responsible of his death were the Montoya brothers... Now hear this. And their little hunting party... they blamed us for something we never did. They just uploaded it to social media. We know who you are, and we're going after you. I feel responsible for all this. But, why? What do you mean why? Because I came up with the idea of blaming them.. Of the slaughter in the vulture's canyon. Don't you remember? Of course Don Ruben... but how would you know the Padillas were going to kill that bastard's brother? That's right Don't Ruben!...no way! Of course it wasn't your fault. Okey, whatever. But the reality in this video is that they're threatening us directly. You have to hide boys. At least for a while! Nacho, you need to get your family out of here. Today! These bastards are serious. What about you Don Ruben? What you're gonna do? Me?...I stay here. I already have a commitment to society. We're gonna face these bastards. Who are "we"? The municipal and the state police... Mr. Winchester... and me... - What about us Don Rubén?! - Listen No, no, no, wait! You think we'll leave you alone, Don Ruben? After you helped us end Los Padilla? But, what help are you talking about? I arrived to the action just to count the dead. Listen to me Don Ruben... Finally, I got the ranch back... ranch of my mother, taken from her by these mother fuckers Padillas. Do you think I'm going to allow... that other bastards come and take it away from me again! Listen to me... better dead before that happens. That's it Don Ruben... Do you think I'm gonna let them extort me again? Never more. Okey. Let's hit it. The hell with that! Well said! I already missed the adrenaline Don Ruben! Let's get ready! But we have to keep something in mind... With the Padilla, we were the hunters. With these... we've become the prey. Good point Nacho. We must try not to walk alone. And always be armed to the teeth. They blamed us for something we never did. We know who you are, and we're going after you. This is the message that circulates from today on all social networks... According to reports, this sinister character calls himself "El Morro"... who commands a criminal group called Los Masiaca. He was talking about you, didn't he? I warn you, I will not leave you alone. But Dolores... Don't even tell me you're going to send me... to the U.S. with your uncle, because I won't let you alone. - But, the kids? - Don't worry, tomorrow we take them... to their grandparents in Santiago. Nacho... We've been through worse. Give it to me. Are they gonna take us to the fair? Sure, but you have to obey your grandparents and behave, okey? And, if we don't? Then, no, you won't go. I want you always be together, OK? Nachito, you are responsible of your brother because you are the oldest. But he never obeys me. I always obey him. Sure? Sure. Okay, hop in, we're leaving. Mom, I wanna go to the bathroom. We just left, why didn't you go at the house? I just wanted to pee right now. Of course. Can't you wait till the next gas station? No, I want go now. Come on. You, do you wanna go? - No. - You better go, I won't stop. Okey. Just there, why are you hiding? Someone can see me. - Who's gonna see you? - My mom. So what?, she's your mother. So? - She's gonna see me. - Okey hurry up. Dad, my zipper is stuck. Let's see. Boys! Boys!, Dolores! Boys! Dad! Dad! Nacho! Where is your mom? She was taken in a black truck. We don't know for sure if this kidnapping of women... is related to Los Masiaca. I bet my ass they are. That would be quite a coincidence Commander, wouldn't it? There's only one way to find out. How? Asking them. How are we going to ask them? Time ago, the Masiaca had their base nearby, by the Nayar. But when the Padillas kicked them out... they had to leave to the Mountains. Close to Otinapa. I know all this because an employee of mine lives there. He told me he saw them passing by. We just need him to tell us where they are. How are we gonna do it? We can't just walk in and knock on the door. Like the big bad wolf. Where is that worker? We can go to his house. Let's go. Let some of my men go with you. No! no patrols. That would only alert them. We're going to surprise them. Okey... I agree. I prefer your people here at the ranch. Sure, don't worry. Mrs. Dolores! Olga! Are you okey Olga? Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. Hey Don Ruben... These Masica, where the fuck did they come from? This asshole in the video, they call him El Morro. His dad's from a town called Masiaca, down in southern Sonora... next to The Sierra. They say he was a heartless son of a bitch. He already owed several lives. That's why he had to get out of town. It was then when he came to work here... with the most heartless mobster there was in the seventies. They called him the golden donkey. But it didn't take to long to this bastard to kill him. Since then, they've been called Los Masiaca. He, who lives by the sword, will die by the sword. And soon, they killed him too. Leaving their sons in charge. One of them, is the one killed by Los Padilla. The other one is this fucking Morro. How do you know all this, Don Ruben? My employee, who lives near there, told me all this. We got to get one of those motherfuckers alive. Alive and kicking. Let's go. Move on. These Masiaca, are more savage and violent... But they're assholes and useless... It'll make it easier for us to catch them. If we eliminate their leader, El Morro... They're gonna behave like headless chickens. They won't know where to run. You're right Don Ruben. Most important is to rescue Dolores. Once she's safe, we can hunt down each one of them. But, El Morro, leave that bastard to me. Fernando, It's Don Ruben. Good afternoon Don Ruben. Good afternoon Fernando. Friends. Nice to meet you. Hi. Fernando, can you tell me where the Morro's ranch is? Of course Don Ruben, just take that road and go around that hill... Ahead is a meadow... You reach the hill of the three crosses. I recommend you climb to the top, from there you can see everything. Very well... thanks Fernando. See you soon. Let's get the hell out of here! This is the hill the boy told me. From up there we can see the whole ranch. But... For me, that's rough. You go up, I'll go around, and we'll meet there. There are two at the entrance. In the courtyard, there are... one... two... three... four... five... six... Approximately, 10 fuckers. There... have the girls. Pedro... we're going this way... You two... finish with those two of the wall. Let's go. You just turn her around and you'll see. I can't wait to see her. You're late man. Hand me the gun and go on, it's your turn. I want to have it. Good luck man. You weren't expecting from this side. Bastards. Who the hell?! There he goes! I'll cover you... like always. Help me... I'm dying... help me please. Shut up! You're not gonna die bastard! When my dad came here... He took over this ranch... Was his favorite... He wanted to build a house right here... With stables, and fruit trees over there... But the Padillas showed up, and ended his dream. I'm gonna bring my dad's ashes, and put them in that tree. Where he used to swing me when I was a kid. And so... my old man can see... how we recovered everything that belonged to him. Morro!...boss! What happened?! They attacked Otinapa's ranch. Who did it?! The police. Motherfuckers! The girls? They took them all, boss. So that's how it's gonna be, huh? Komatzu... Stick to the plan. Take the best men. What about these, boss? Let them rot... and be a lesson to others. I just see 12 women. And the shipment must be 20 Mr. Morro. We do it for security Mr Hassam. We have them placed in different locations. Don't worry. In Mexico we say: "we do not put all the eggs in a single basket" I don't understand what this "egg thing" has to do with this... I can't fail in this shipment. Wait! I like this one. She's a very special girl, Mr Hassam. Getting her was like finding a 50-carat diamond. How much? It's twice the price. Okey. You are a god damn beasts! Shut the fuck up! I like her temper. I like it. I'll see you lying on the floor. I doubt it precious, you will be very far when that happens. It's a miracle he's alive, he has lost a lot of blood. I knew where I was shooting him, that's why he didn't die. Will it take him long to talk? In 24 hours he will regain consciousness. It's too much 24 hours, I need it sooner. We will do our best. You must do more than best. No one can know this man is here... If El Morro finds out, he will come for him. And if that happens... He'll kill anyone who gets in his way. Understood? You're crazy if you think I'm gonna say that. Oh yeah? If you don't say it, you'll die, you asshole. I'd rather die than send my companions to the slaughter. Okey. Very well officer... You already realized we are not playing... Or do you want to play hero? One... - Two - Okey, okey, okey Okey. But I don't want it to sound fake or agitated... 'Cause they're gonna think you're fucking a chick, you prick... So... you better... calm... Take a deep breath. Do it, do it... relax... There it is bring it closer. You better don't say a key that I don't like, jackass. Attention, central. We have located the kidnapped person... We contacted the black Ford truck... it comes escorted, we were shot... We are following them on the Deer Road. Near Los Tulipanes Ranch. Roger, roger... Attention to all units at east of the city... This is Commander Uribe... Go to the support site... See you at the exit to the Tulipanes Ranch. Did you hear that? - Yes Sir. - Hit it to the Ranch. Roger base, we're sending in backup. Ja, ja, ja... get ready boys! They are coming! Put the dead man in the trunk. And put the cop inside patrol... and take it one mile ahead. We are arriving at the place... get ready. Something's wrong... I don't like this. Fire! Boys... go to sleep. Dolores! The famous Nacho Montoya. You know... I admire you. It looks incredible to me that you, and your group of hunters... you could have ended with the mafia created by the Padilla. And the best part... Hitting Julio where it hurt the most... his wife... You took her down from that bastard. And as they say, "If you steal from the thief..." What do you want? Get even. I'll give myself up... Do what you want with me, but release my wife... She has nothing to do with this. We had nothing to do either... with the massacre of the Padilla's men in the buzzard canyon. My brother died, and many of my men... We never thought that could have consequences... I'm sorry. But it did. And now... it's time for us to revenge. What do you want? Your ranch... and your beautiful wife. Don't you dare touch her, bastard. How are you gonna stop it? Just watch... and listen... An eye for an eye... a tooth for a tooth... learn... No! Nacho, please help me!...No! No!...please no! Let me go!...please! Nacho!, please help me!...please! Let me go yo bastard!...let me go! Are you still there? I'm gonna kill you... I'm gonna kill you son of a bitch! Nacho. Any news? That mother fucker contacted me. Dolores is alive. Thanks god! And what does he want? What is he asking for? He wants my ranch... The ranch and Dolores! What! This asshole is crazy! We must rescue her before this animal keeps hurting her. Of course, but let me... wait! It's another call. Yes? Okey... thank you Miss... that's good... thank you for calling. Nacho, it was call from the hospital... the wounded has awakened. I'm coming. Pedro! What happened Nacho? I'm going to the hospital... the bastard woke up. Good, I'm going to your house with your kids. I'll be there in 20. Thanks. Can he talk? - Just a little, I think that... - Perfect! Listen to me, you son of a bitch... You're gonna tell where the Morro is. Where he hides. Ja... The Morro does not hide... The ones who have to hide, are you. Look shithead! I won't say it again... Where is El Morro? Are you gonna tell me where The Morro is? Next time I'll rip your guts out, fucker! Where is El Morro?! Don't even think about yelling. Where is El Morro? He's in Guatimapé... At the Hacienda de la Rosa... My wife... is she there? I don't know, I don't know... I swear... Girls are taken to different places... But I know something... They're going after Commander Uribe, the others, your family... and you. Get the kids out of the ranch and get them to a safe place. Don Ruben, they are preparing an attack against us... I must warn the others. Hey Nacho, what's up? Get everybody out of the hotel! Close it, they're coming for you! Listen to me... we need to get all the guests out, but now! - Why, what's happening Lencho?! - There is no time to explain... How many we got? There are two... Room two and three. Get them out now! You, room number two, I get number three! What's happening?! - We need you to leave the hotel please. - But why? - It's an emergency. - But, our things? We'll take them out later, don't worry. Please, this way. What's up? We need you to leave the room. But, Is there a fire? We don't know yet. - But... - It's gonna be just a moment. We need you to leave the room, please. Come on Leoncio, answer the phone! God damn it! Hello Nacho. Leoncio doesn't answer me. Must be in the stables. I'm going with you and Lencho. We have to go warn him. I'll wait you here. How did you find out they were coming for us? I got the truth out of the wounded guy in the hospital. Today, in the morning... Commander Uribe and his men were killed. Oh man, what?! Fucking shit! Let's go! I hope we're not too late with Leoncio. Then what, Don Juan? How many steers we have? - There are 32. - Very good. What the fuck. Who are those bastards? Don't know boss. I do not like this. - Where is Leoncio?! - They are attacking him! I hope we're not too late. Heaven forbid. We're gonna grab them from behind, Shit! Fuck it! Come on prick! Lucky that you got here just in time, dude. I kept calling you man. I don't have good reception in the corral. But I saw them coming from afar. We were complaining about the Padillas, but these bastards are worse. They're son of bitches! They come determined to everything! I know where the Morro hides. Where? He's in a ranch, in Guatimapé. Surely, there they have Dolores. Hello. Marilú, It's Nacho. Hello Nacho, what's happening? I call Dolores to her phone and the house and she won't answer. Marilu... Dolores was kidnapped. What?! Look, I don't have to much time to explain you... I need a favor. Can you take care of my kids while this happens? But! Yes, of course Nacho. You want me to go get them? No, I'll take them to you. It's better this way, it's safer. How you wish. See you in two hours. Okey. Pick up Miye, pick up! Hello. Dolores was kidnapped! What?! How?! When?! I don't know!, I have no idea! I just got a call from Nacho. Go to my house, I'll see you there. I'll be right there. We are deeply disturbed. I know. The kids? Come down. Don't worry about them, they'll be fine here. Let us know if you know anything. Of course. A patrol is going to stay here 24 hours. Take care. That's okey. You should have more respect for other people's time, Mr. Morro. I have an hour waiting for you, and it's always the same. I'm sorry, Mr. Hassam, I've had a bit of trouble. You mean these, Mr. Morro. I suppose these affect us. Something unexpected happened. How could they attack the place and take 14 women? Someone leaked information to the police. It was supposed to be a safe and well-guarded place. It won't be difficult to find who did it. I don't care who did it, or if you catch them or not... Now... we have a problem. Do you know what the Chinese Triad is? No. The Chinese mafia is known as the triad... You can't joke with them. They have cells all over the world... Even here in Mexico. I represent them in Saudi Arabia. The Triad branch that deals in human trafficking... mostly women, is called Fu-Chin. With them, I have committed this shipment, I got paid in advance. If I don't comply... not only me will end up beheaded... they will come for you too. Wow... how spooky the story sounds, right? You better take this seriously. Don't worry Mr. Hassam. I assure you, I'm interested in having my head in it's place. The shipment will be ready, when does the ship leave? Next Friday. By Thursday, you'll got your entire shipment on the dock. I give you my word. I hope so. And remember to include my "50-carat diamond". See you Thursday. 50 carat diamond, Boss? Bullshit from this fucking Arab date. He liked Nacho Montoya's wife, and so he baptized her. I wanted to keep it for myself... But business comes first. How many do we have? Only the 10 we have here boss. We have today and tomorrow to get the other 10. Boss, they found 11 dead guards out of the 12 we had in Otinapa. A neighbor told us they had taken one of our guards... in an ambulance to the Hospital La Paz. That can be very dangerous. His tongue can get loose. Yeap. They may turn up here at any moment. You take care of it. Very well. And you... let's get those women we're missing. Yes boss. You can't be here, it's a restricted area. Sorry, I got the number 216. That's on the top floor. Thank you. Come on. Quickly! I don't have the whole fucking day! Hey, yo, are you going to get more? Yep, I still have to go to El Morcillo Ranch... for another group that Komatsu has there. Hey you! Around the corner is the White House. Get in there. Move! Damn chicks. And you? weren't you leaving? I'm gonna take a piss, or what? can't I? Why don't you take mine? It's already yours. This is yours, you prick. How many did you bring? Five, Boss. What happened? Everything okey, chief. Ready Boss... it's done. The shipment is ready. Komatsu will take the rest of the girls, so we can go to Maztlan. The girls are ready? Yes Boss, we washed them and they are very clean now. I'm gonna prepare the "crown jewel". Where's the woman who was here? I... I don't know boss. Who let the door open? I don't know, I wasn't here. Maybe you left it open, you're the only one with the key. Bitch mother fucker! She may have gone to help her friend. Let's go. Yunque!, get the van ready! There goes the komatsu with more girls! Yeah, I'm coming! What a pain in the ass! She's not anywhere... who knows where she got. She's not in the stables either. She couldn't have escaped, she must be around. Unless... Son of a bitch! She got in the truck! Which truck boss? The one with the girls, dickhead! What's up boss. Did the girls' truck got there? Yes, few hours ago, we're about to ship them. Listen to me carefully... Nacho Montoya's wife escaped Check the truck! This nasty girls let me this shitter... What the fuck! Mother fucker! What happened? Yes, she was in the truck, boss. You have her? No, she hit the driver and ran away. You're a bunch of useless! It's not possible you can't catch a woman! You're delaying the delivery, god damn it! We should already be shipping them in Mazatlán! Look... I'm going there... For your sake, you better have everything ready. Otherwise, they're gonna start rolling heads. You two... Get the truck ready! And take them to the cellar at once. There, you're going to join the truck Komatsu sent. And hit the road to Mazatlan. Do you know where the cellar is? No Boss, I've never been there. You, send him the location. Okey. There's nothing here, let's go. Chuy, where are you? I'm heading to the bale warehouse. Roger Shut up or I'll give you a reason to cry for real! Who knows how to use this? I do. My father was in the army. Ma'am, help me please! Kid, over there there is a hole in the fence, go through it! Over there! Girl, but where did you come from? They had me kidnapped. But how?, Where?! In a ranch... over there. Holy Mother! Come in, come, come. - Hey, watch that truck. - What's wrong with him? Slow down man, slow down. Victor!? Duck! Take that bastard. Here on the couch, lie down. Put your feet up. Watch your head. Poor little child. Oh my God. Drink this, it's gonna help you. Slowly. I'll call the police. Eh... yes... look. I have a girl here who came to my house... She tells me, they had her kidnapped... Yes... look... my house is in the Union Camp. Yes! Very well... I'll wait for you here. You're gonna be okey... you're gonna be okey... Hey! Officers! I'm the Major! Don Ruben!, what are you doing here?! Just grabbing motherfuckers! These are my boys, let them get up. Okey, On your feet, boys! - Stand up. - I don't want you to touch the guns! - On your feet! - Cool man, they're my people. Don't shoot! We are here to help you! Okey. Don Ruben! Call an ambulance! I'm gonna put pressure on the wound, okay? Mr. Montoya. Olga! No, no, no...! No, please don't, Ma'am! I was already there when Mrs Dolores arrived. Then, some men came.. They were... they were like Arabs. They were selling us like animals. This guy... Morro.. Asked them to pay him more... for your wife... for Ms, Dolores... Where is she? Why doesn't she come with you? She was taken to another room. A room next to ours. We just listened to her screams. We never saw her again. But, I listened this morning... that his Boss, that Morro... was yelling at his workers... shouting them... "How was it possible, that Montoya's wife have escaped" She escaped?! Yes!, and I also heard... That they were going to take us to Mazatlan. To get us on a boat. They must be taking them there. I'm going to call the commander of the police in Mazatlan But how to know in which dock are they going to embark on? True, Mazatlan has many entrances to the sea. I think I know where they're going. The trusted man of the Morro, who they call "El Muñeco"... The one who looks very queer... He passed the location to one of his guards on his cell phone. Check the others! Here it is! It is on... La Isla de Piedra. In the "Collera de las Chivas"...there they are. Let's go. Hold on, Nacho, they're changing the plan. They're saying they're meeting at a ranch before they get to Mazatlan. Does it say where? Yes, they're sending the location. It's about two miles from here, before we hit the freeway. Very close from here Nacho, two miles only. We're gonna get them there. Yeah, what you w... According to Google maps, it's in a cabin on the right. Let's go around them. Lencho, Leoncio, go behind that warehouse. Done. We're going this way. - Ready. - Okey. Let's go. Come on man. What do we do now, brother? Wait. Hey buddy... I think that shithead is the Muñeco. Boys... come this way. Here we have a clean shot. They're coming out. Don't shoot until you have a straight shot. Okey. Doing business with you Mr. Morro... It has been a real nightmare. These women should be here since yesterday. Son of a bitch! We said Thursday Mr Hassam. And it's still Thursday. We still have to take them to Mazatlán. A truck is coming, boss. And how are you going to pay, Mr Hassam? Don't worry about the payment... better take care of having my 20 women... at the boat tomorrow Anyway, I'll show how professional we are... Al Abim, bring the suitcase. Mother fucker! Now everything depends on you, Mr.Morro. Come on, get off. What the hell are you waiting for! Get off! You!...move on! You owe one bitch. Dolores! Calm down Nacho! I know how you feel. We have to be cautious and smarter than them. Take the girls to the room. Come on girls. But, what is this?! Mr. Morro, there are only 6 women here. I told you Mr. Hassam, we have them spread out in different places. They're coming, don't worry. For everyone's sake, I hope that truck gets here. Muñeco... call these bastards to see where they are. Fuck. Shut the fuck up! This is a trap! Where is El Morro? He is inside. He's with the girls. You better give up, Morro! There's nowhere to run. That's what you think, fucker! You, get out! Out! Move! Don Ruben... Can you hit the Arab? Of course Nacho... you don't worry. Leave that bastard to me. El Morro is for me. I got you at 50 yards, northwest wind, 40 knots. Stay together! Dolores! Calm... calm... I'll be right back. It won't be long. Are you okey? Wait, wait, wait! Don't kill me please! - Fucking Frodo! - Wait, look... Where is him? I'm a simple engineer who has me working for them. Where is El Morro?! I am one more victim of them. I swear! I don't know anything! Wait, wait! Is right next door man. It's done? Let's go. I told you, we just needed to cut the head of this ball of crap. Don Ruben! What's wrong man?! Nacho... Don Ruben! Nacho... This is the end of the tune.
