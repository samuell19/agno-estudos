Dori Meyer’s voice mail. Leave a message and I’ll get back to you. Hello, Dori, where are you? I’m worried. You said you’d pick me up. Let’s meet at the home with your brother. Hurry, all right? SARA STEIN - OLD FRIENDS Dori will be here any minute. Dear residents, dear relatives. Thank you all for coming again this year to honor this important day, the Jom haScho’a, with music. Today for the first time with the concert pianist David Shapiro. Together we want to celebrate life in memory of those who have lost theirs. David. You’re dead! You weren’t fast enough. Not in shape, man. I’m sorry, okay? I’m really sorry, old man, okay? I’m out of practice. -There was no alternative. -Big time. -It’ll come back. -You’re not in shape, man. Cheer up! Let’s go and have a drink. -I was there the whole time. -All right, man! Listen, Ayman. The attacker kept hitting her with it. Her head, her chest. And her back three times. A 70-year-old woman. Probably floored after the first blow. Does it happen often in your neighborhood? Who could it have been? Uncuff him, Uri. That’s against the rules. Coffee? I sold my bike for a good price. So I wanted to celebrate. So you went to the kiosk to buy alcohol. I wanted vodka. Three bottles. When you left the kiosk, was Mrs. Benhalim all right? She-- She even gave me a bagful of ice. Tastes better with it. That’s what she said. -I’ll do the report? -Yes. You’ve already done two hours extra. He’s lying. First it was chocolate, then vodka. Two people at the kiosk swore under oath she served them after him. Where he comes from, you get an alibi for a packet of cigarettes. Let him go. We know where he lives. She may come out of her coma and describe him. Blok will go berserk. Let him. He’ll choke on his stupid prejudices one day. -See you tomorrow. -Yep. To us. -Cheers. -Leyahim. Well, Yoram? Getting nervous? Are you kidding me? The prenatal classes were more terrifying than the Nablus offensive. -He doesn’t even have a woman. -The right one didn’t show yet. What are you staring at? Take that trash out and then you can go. Hey, careful! You’re done here till tomorrow evening. That’s kind, Uncle, thanks. Thanks. Don’t blow it. Don’t worry, Sara. You’ll easily pass the test for new citizens. Straight on. -Watch out, beside you. -I saw it. Not while you’re driving! Here. What is that? A hand. -What? -In the sand. Oh, it’s my boss. Can you take it? Answer it. Yes? -Have you seen it? -Yes. Where are you? I’ve got a driving lesson. -Blok isn’t answering his phone. -He’s got a private appointment. I’m doing his shift. Go take a look at it on the beach. Oh, no, Godin. I’m finished for the day. Am I supposed to go there? Brake, brake now! What’s all this? It’s Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Memorial Day. -Get out. -Oh, right. I forgot all about it. Oh, shit. I have to go. -What? -But we’re celebrating. Ehud, let him be. Duty calls. No, this one’s on me. You’re my guests. But I thought you were broke. That’s why he got a rich woman pregnant. Here. Drink. -One as a parting gesture. -For sure. To Blok. Who showed us how to survive. -And how to drink. -That too. And to all those no longer with us. Yes. Leyahim. David. -I’ll come by and we’ll sort it out. -Fine. Take care. -I’ll drive you. -You’ve had as much as me. But I can afford a better lawyer. You carry a gun, huh? Yeah, for the last few months. -Supporting public safety. -Show me. It’s a new law. Jericho, 15 shots, huh? Military issue. Where did you get it? -Internet. -Bullshit. -Want one too? -Internet… Fine, all right. Members of the Special Forces get a discount. Even former ones. Hey, it’s our lucky day. I’d rather have your boots. They’re awesome. Over my dead body. Come on. Come on! Homicide Tel Aviv. May I? Yes, of course. Hello. Oh, my God. Young, white male. Definitely not an Arab fisherman who fell from the cutter. It’d be good to know if he was dead before he fell. -I’d have to-- -Do an autopsy first? Exactly. Thank you. -“Shalom, my friend-- -I miss you.” That’s a quote from Bill Clinton. After Rabin’s assassination, it became a key phrase in the peace movement. “Shalom, my friend, I miss you.” I can put in the report that the hand was still in the water when I got here. It’s low tide. What? Why? Then it’d be the coast guards’ responsibility. That’s what Blok would do. Hi. The old lady from the shop has just woken up. Thank God for that. Hanan, we must get a description of the attacker. Age, skin color. And take a picture of Ayman. I’m on my way. -Thank you. -You’ve got me here for this? Did the little Arab confess to the murder? The old woman is alive, and out of the coma. It’s irrelevant given his record. I had to let him go. What? What did you do? I’ll send you the report later. I don’t care about your report. You let a killer go. So, how’s it going? Should it be high or low tide? Dori? Dori, are you there? -Hello, Dahir. -Hello, Zvia. Do you know where my son is? -No. -No? We were to meet this morning. He promised to pick me up and didn’t come. That’s not like him. I’m really sorry, I haven’t seen him since yesterday. But something was up with him. Do you think…? Tell him to call me. I’m going to the police. Of course, I will. Take care, now. You too. If I don’t come back, take it out. Dori, what is this? My life insurance. If I don’t come back, take it to the police. I phoned the coast guard. No missing sailors, divers, seamen, or any other accident or death where a hand could have been lost. I checked the missing persons. Five men in all, one is 95, two are dark-skinned. That leaves two of them. One named Avi Katz, 48, and one Dori Cohen, 27. He was reported missing by his mother just an hour ago. We don’t know anything about Avi Katz. Except he was a drug addict and was last seen two weeks ago. We don’t really know much more about Dori Cohen either. From Tel Aviv, single, lives and works at Bet Noah House, a small left-wing human rights organization, which would fit well with the Rabin tattoo. Is it related to the murder of Amakov’s son? I don’t understand. Isn’t Amakov in jail? -Yes. -Yes. But it’s not clear who Amakov’s new rep is on the outside. Yeah, I can… ask around if you want. If I don’t suspend you for drinking on duty. I’m not even here. It’s my day off. What are you all staring at? We’ll deal with the two missing persons for now. Check if there’s a record of them leaving the country. Get on to this Dori’s mobile. Send Hanan out to that Bet Noah house. I’m sorry I’m late. There’s good news and bad news. The old woman has come out of her coma. And the bad news? There he is. Where’s Omar? He wrote me to say he can’t come. -But we’ve a big concert next week. -I don’t think he’ll be back. What? What do you mean? Why not? Okay. Juliet, can you take over first violin? As an exception. Your generous help for Uriel has been suspicious to me. My brother seems to have various accounts with more than half a million euros. -You have sole access to the accounts. -How do you know? Just like you drug dealers, we street workers have contacts. -What do you want? -You need to ask? Do you think I’m going to keep quiet when you’re supplying my brother with arms and drug money? -I’ll go to the cops and tell them. -You? -She won’t make it. She’s too soft. -Of course. Where she comes from, murderers do theater workshops in prison. David. I’m home. Hey, you’re home already. -Hey. -Hey. -Who’s that? -Just a friend from the old days. -I ran into him this morning. -Play it. -I was about to turn it off. -I want to see it. Come on, show me what you got. Come on! Man, David. -Is that you? -At least, it was me, yeah. It’s years ago. You look so young. Enough of this valuable cultural contribution. -You never told me about that. -No, why should I? That was during training. That’s why. -How was your day? -Not so great. But I don’t need a drink. I let a suspect go on lack of evidence. And today the guys with prejudices were right, unfortunately. Blok is pissed off with me. It was his suspect. -Then he should have taken care of it. -He wasn’t there. -Veterans’ meeting. -Ah, the same fun every year. -Boozing and shooting. -Yeah. You should’ve gone. Then you wouldn’t be drinking alone. -We drink for different reasons. -Yeah? They drink to remember… I drink to forget. We missed you this morning. As ever. I get why you’re mad at me. Really? -Godin should have suspended you. -We’ll catch Ayman again. A seventeen-year-old. Where could he get to? He’s long gone. Through the tunnel. And they build a new one every day. Sara? -Hello, this is Daniel. -Hi Daniel. Hold on. What news? He was already dead when he was thrown overboard. The ship’s propeller got him. The bones to the rear are totally fragmented. Like in a food mixer. The surrounding tissue as well. No fish, not even a fat predator could have done it. And…two fingers are missing. As if torn out with brute force. I did a CT to make sure. A bullet went through his palm. Definitely not an accident. That would have looked different. I’d say he was tortured. We also found concrete particles where the nails were ripped off. The DNA analysis is here. I need something from our missing friend for a match. Drug stash? Hard to say. Someone else has already been here. But did they find what they were looking for? Look at this. That must be Dori. What is it, Blok? Nothing. -Come in, I’m Lia. -Hanan. I’ll show you Dori’s office. -I haven’t heard from him for two days. -Is it usual for him to just vanish? Now and then, yeah. There’s been a mix-up. I’m not from the Aliens Department. I’m from the Homicide squad. The good guys. The good guys. Sure you are. It makes no difference to us. A cop’s a cop. So once again, is this usual? No, he’s almost always here. But sometimes he goes to Holot. You know what I mean. To Holot. The deportation prison in the desert. An open facility, of course. But where can you go during the day in the desert? That’s why we go and care for people. Lia? We need you. Can you come here? Sorry. I’ll be right back. Uncle. Let’s go in. Did you fuck up, Dahir? I need you to help me, Uncle. Dori’s disappeared. I think he’s dead. One of the men who was here yesterday has something to do with it. Who do you mean? Take it to the police, Uncle Ibrahim. As an illegal, I can’t. But you can show them, Uncle. Please. -Dori is my friend. -Very well, then. Make yourself something to eat. Go in the kitchen. You’re very good to me. What exactly do you do for them? We try to help them. That’s all. We try to find apprenticeships or a place in school. We help them to extend their temporary residence permit, for example. And we raise money for them. Aren’t you worried you haven’t heard from Dori for two days? To be honest, I am. He was meeting some tugboats in Akko yesterday. It’s illegal, even for the good guys. -Do you have a name or address? -No. -Everyone keeps their contacts quiet. -As a safety measure. -So I don’t know Dori’s. -I see. You smell good. -Thank you. -To our little Tomer. He has to come out first. Your mobile. -What’s up? -Something serious. What? I’ve got a video here. It doesn’t look good for you. What sort of video? He doesn’t know the store is yours and wants me to tell the police. I’ll be there in half an hour. Make sure he doesn’t take off. All right. Hey, beautiful. Come on, go in. Smile. Dahir Wahadi, born 1984, Sudanese. Applied for asylum two years ago and was denied. That’s why we had his fingerprints. Dori’s place was full of them. The kid’s passport was lying around in a bag. He must have left in a hurry. What was in the cistern? Nothing. But it had been used to hide stuff. They were after something specific. Anything indicating a fight? Bloodstains? No. Any news on mobile location? I’ll call the state prosecutor. -For you. -No, thanks. Shoot. Nobody at Bet Noah knows where Dori is. But nobody wanted to speak. One of the two missing people showed up. Avi Katz. He was in a homeless shelter for 10 days. Well, trashed apartment, illegal roommate, severed arm. Guess it’s time to talk to the mother. -We’re headed there right now. -But don’t break her heart. We don’t have a DNA match yet. Blok, you take on Amakov. Maybe he’s still got a hand in it from jail. -Yeah. -I’ve told them you’re coming. -Is there anything else? -No. I’ll be back at the office. Dessert’s on me. Okay. Who’s having what? Come on, sit down. Do as he says. Sit down. -I hear you’re a friend of Dori’s. -No, no. Dori’s just looking for a job for me. Ibrahim thinks you may have something for me. Know what he wanted from me? He tried to blackmail me. And I have no idea why. He wanted a lot of money. Give me your phone. Where’s the memory card? Yoram, I was here the whole time. Where is the memory card? I don’t know… You know what? I believe you. Maybe you just need a little something to relax. What are you doing? Uncle! Uncle, please don’t go. Uncle. Uncle Ibrahim. Please, Yoram. The boy is harmless. I think you’re going too far, man. No! No! Let me go! No! No! Please don’t. Let me go. We have to be on the safe side. Even if he’s your nephew. He was really here till you came. Keep your spirits up. -Yes? -Mrs. Meyer? So you spoke to him the day before yesterday? Yes, we had an important appointment, and Dori is very reliable. -He never lets me down. -You have a good relationship. Yeah. We regularly talk on the phone, especially before he’s about to embark on something. So that I won’t worry. What sort of things? At first, collecting clothes for veterans. Then he began to work for refugees from Africa. That’s him. Here. He helped everyone. I even had to take out a mortgage. That’s why I’m still working. What about his elder brother? Are they on good terms? Uriel gave his life for this country. He was a good soldier. -I’m so sorry. -Does Dori have any tattoos? -Why do you ask? -It may help us to find him. Of course he’s got tattoos. Lots of them. If you ask me, they’re terrible. I’ve told him so often, but he… he had to have them. Did he have one like this? I don’t know. We must go. -You think something bad has happened? -No, I was just interested. She was worn out. Don’t you think? You know what’s killing me? How little she knew her son. The tattoo, the flat. We’ve got our man. It all points to that. He’s dead. Hello. Are you registered? Hats off, Blok, that you dare to visit me. Want to hit me? Then hit me, Amakov. I like you, Blok, you know that. Otherwise, you’d be stone-cold dead. Don’t go all soft on me. We found a hand on the beach. Torn off, with cement under the fingernails. Somewhere out there, in our beautiful bay, is the rest of that poor bastard. In cement shoes. What’s this got to do with me? We all know that’s how you got rid of the competition. I have an alibi. Yes. Your son Yuri too. What’s going on out there? Can’t be easy running a well-oiled business from jail. Are you done? What’s the point, Sergey? You’re old and tired. You’re making mistakes. Help me. Then I’ll make sure you’re out a few months early. What do you say? We were on an ancient ship, packed with Jews from Kiev and Odessa. Your father and I, we were maybe six years old, and neither of us had parents. Wherever our ship tried to dock, we were turned away. The next time we saw land on the horizon, your father said to me, “Go on, jump. Jump, Sergey.” I was scared. He jumped first. If you want my help, tell me who killed Yuri. Yes. From here. That’s one of Dori’s protégés. He got him into a school. But his asylum plea was rejected? Know how many Sudanese refugees have been granted asylum -in the past ten years? -No. Zero. Not one. But it’s not so easy to deport them. That’s where we come in. A few weeks of tuition, then we challenge the rejection with our lawyers. -Are you successful? -Sometimes. Israel is terribly afraid of letting refugees in. Despite this state being built by refugees. So we help them with contacts. Find small jobs for them. -That’s illegal. -Yes. Dori went to a lot of trouble. Dahir was ambitious. He wanted to do everything right. We spoke to the landlord here. Your rent is six months behind. Yes, Dori said he would handle it. He always sorted things out. Did you sleep with him? Excuse me? How is that any of your business? I just want to know exactly how badly you want us to find your boss. Dori would never just let us down. This place, the organization, this is his family, his whole life. If Dahir shows up, call me right away, okay? Thank you. Good-bye. Great woman, huh? Bitch and do-gooder at the same time. It’s understandable. -She has firm views. -I think she’s lying. She knows where Dahir is. -Can’t we just tap her phone? -We’ll never get approval. Drive me home? I’m in a rush. I have to buy something for dinner. Hey, this is a surprise. Is this how you live? -It’s only rented. -Oh, just rented. Ehud was right. That’s why you got married. -Where’s your wife? -Walking the dog. -Beer? -Yeah, thanks. That body part we found on the beach had cement under the fingernails, and the wrist was shot through. Ring a bell? Sure, it was Amakov’s method. Back at Schechter’s. You were there when he bragged about it, weren’t you? Me and lots of others. On his son’s birthday. It didn’t do you much good though. -No corpse… -No crime. You still put him in jail. With your help. He deserved it. That bastard. I don’t care if he croaks in there. Did you know his son? He was a bastard too. Any idea who iced him? No. I was with Amakov today. He seemed composed, like he had no worries about his business. You mean he found a successor? There are more drugs on the street than ever. So that’s why you came. I don’t work for you guys anymore. It’s over. Come on, Yoram. Anyone who likes to shoot comes to your range. People drink, talk. Help me, Yoram. If Amakov found out you recorded him talking to me, then… -Why would he? -What’s this about? Do you remember Uri? Uriel Meyer? Of course. Our sniper. -Where did you get this? -From his brother’s place. -Dori. Do you know him? -No, I didn’t know he had a brother. -Know what happened? -To Uriel? -He had a lot of problems. -Drug problems. Yeah. I lent him money a few times. When was that? Seven, eight years ago. No idea. His brother, Dori, has gone missing. -The hand you found? -It could be. I’ll ask around. You’re a good soldier, Yoram. Even if you sacrificed two comrades on our last exercise. I won. That’s true. Oh. Hello. Wilson, how are you? Do you know where David will be playing in February? So the first week in February. I’d join you. I have a few days off. What? There you are. I must go to Jerusalem. -Something wrong? -No. Why would you say that? Why do you think that, huh? -Did Wilson call you? -Correct. -Why didn’t you tell me about the tour? -I don’t know. Are you crazy? We’d just talked about it. And you cancel it behind my back? No one needs another Chopin interpretation. -What’s wrong with you? -Why? Because I won’t be the performing monkey. You’re a gifted pianist and people have a right to hear your music. But music alone changes nothing, it can’t undo things. What will you do instead? Carry on with your little youth orchestra? Who do you think you are talking to me like that? Hey? You of all people. What’s wrong with you? You play cops and dig around in the misfortune of strangers. Is that to take your mind off your own shit? Like you being adopted. Have you talked to your parents yet instead of attacking others? I just think I should focus more on us and my youth orchestra. These kids are so full of life, dreams. I can’t let them down now. They’ll still be there when you get back. And so will I. I’m going to Jerusalem to see Omar, our first violin. I need to talk to his mother. Otherwise, we can kiss the concert good-bye. Maybe you’d like to come along. We could take a look around town and… and talk? -I don’t know when she’ll be back. -I just think it’s too important. The mother’s not here. I’ll come back tomorrow. -Definitely more conservative. -Is it true? Ah, why not? Tastes very good. Let’s get something to eat. Dahir! My God, what happened? Come on, I’ll… I’ll get you inside. Come sit down here, okay? Take it easy. Dahir, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Dahir? You better sit up. Please. Tell me what happened. Who gave you the drugs? Who was it? Does it have something to do with Dori? Do you know where he is? Drink. Better? -I think we should get a doctor now. -No, no. No doctor. Dahir, you must listen to me now. Please. The police were here. They’re looking for you. They were from Homicide. Dahir, please. Do you have something to tell me? Please. -I have to call the police. -No. -Don’t, please. -No, let me. Don’t you understand? I’m sorry, I have to. I can’t risk it. -No. -I’m sorry, Dahir. Please don’t. No. Tiger 2, this is Tiger 3, unknown target to your left. -Uriel. -Tiger 2, this is Tiger 3. If there are no special incidents, carry on. We will. Well? I have no idea. -What would you like? -Coffee, please. Omar’s uncle is threatening to stop supporting the mother. So she won’t be able to pay for the flat. But at least she said she’d think about it. -You should have seen Omar’s face. -So, what are you gonna do now? So no concert? Will you postpone it? Are you crazy. No way! I worked so hard to get to play for these UNICEF people. I’ll play first violin myself, if need be. Why did you never talk to me about something so important? Sit down there, okay? If you ask me, the victim sat right here. -Raised up on this chair, I’d say. -You bastards. Where was the shooter? No. The blood from the bullet through his hand… splattered pretty badly. Right down to here. That’s a good two meters. He was shot in the right hand. That’s why the blood here. -You’re sure it’s Dori’s blood? -Well… the rapid analysis leaves little doubt. -Give him a pair of nice shoes. -That’s flash concrete. It only takes three, four hours to harden. Did you find the bullets? Yeah, from a pistol or a small sub-machine gun. Jericho 15 rounds. -Hey, Hanan. -Hey. -How was Jerusalem? -Tell you later. Okay. So, the ship’s up there. We also found Dori’s mobile in that bike’s saddlebag. It was his bike. Three hours after the GPS data was released, we finally found it. Not bad. Where were you? Family reunion? But no one can come in until they’re done here. They went out to sea and bye. Sara, I have to tell you something. This Dori Meyer is the brother of a former comrade of mine. Uriel? Yeah, he was in our unit. With David and me. Why didn’t you tell me? I wanted to be sure first. I’m your partner, you should have told me. Hanan, we’re going to Zvia’s to give her the sad news of her son’s death. Come. A police spokesman said the severed hand on the beach is that of a human rights activist, Dori Meyer. The young man has been missing for several days. It’s believed he was the victim of a crime. What, you’re drinking coffee? Shoot. What have you got for me? It looks like Dori was dealing drugs. All sorts. Along with a Sudanese guy. Dahir. Apparently it was for a good cause. He used it to finance his shop. I hope that helps. Yeah, what’s new? Hello, Yoram. -Can you please pick me up, Yoram. -Please, try to calm down. -Will you drive me to Uriel’s, please. -I’ll be right there. They’ve just reported it. -Dori’s dead! -Easy, easy. I’ll be right there. See you shortly. Pregnant women. -I have to go. -Sure. Where can I find this Dahir? I guess… he’s long gone. Or at the bottom of the sea with his feet in concrete. Maybe. But what the hell? One shit less. It’s on me. You have no money. AYALON SOUTH HASHALOM RD The disappearance of the young man is believed to be linked to the activities of a Tel Aviv drug ring. His name is Dori Meyer. He has been missing for several days. It’s believed he was the victim of a crime. -Uri, did you guys issue a press release? -Godin authorized it. Why? Do you ever think of the people affected? -This Lia called for you. -Not now. Fuck that shit. Drive faster. How? I know him. He drove Blok to the beach when we found the hand. What does it mean? Follow them. -Shall I come with you? -No, wait here. I can help you? An older woman just went past, Zvia Meyer. Does she work here? She’s in the garden with her son. Shall I show you? -Yes. -This way. -Through the door then right. -Over there on the right? -Guess what. -What? Uriel’s not dead. He’s in a wheelchair, being told the terrible news. -But his mother said… -She did not. We just weren’t listening. -Let’s ask her… -No, let’s not. Not yet. I need to ask someone something first. -Have you finished already or what? -Yes. -Something wrong? -No, everything’s fine. Oh, yeah? I just followed a man I saw on the beach with Blok the other day. Apparently an old friend of his from the military. He drove the mother of a murder victim to a psychiatric facility, where her other son is a patient, to break the news. And I knew him too from your computer. No swearing till I put the ball in. That’s Yoram. Yoram was our MG-gunner. Ehud was driving, and this is… That’s… Uriel, whom you now know too. The one who put the ball in the net, that was our sniper. We rammed holes in the walls of houses and barged through the living rooms of families. We were instructed to shoot only at the legs. But who keeps still so you can aim at him? Why didn’t you tell me? I didn’t think you’d understand. You’re not from here, from this small country surrounded by enemies. As a police officer in Berlin, did you ever shoot someone? No, never. But you have, right? No, neither have I. I gave the order. Uriel did the shooting. Tiger 2 to Tiger 3, unknown target left of you. Unknown target to your left. But I decided it’s my responsibility. Tiger 2 to Tiger 1, a boy’s headed straight for us. -Distance? -Can you see anything? Hard to say. Let him come closer. It’s just wrong to put a machine gun in the hands of an 18-year-old. The area is cleared. Anyone in there is an enemy combatant. Eliminate. He’s… He’s holding something. It could be a hand grenade. No human should ever have the power over life and death. Because we are tainted by it. Come on. The kid’s holding a grenade. Tiger 2 to Tiger 3. -The target’s unclear. -Uriel, can you see what’s in his hand? Uriel! -No. -For fuck’s sake, shoot! What should I do, David? Fire! I should’ve waited till he was closer. But I was scared. Fire. Scared of dying. Yes, Hanan. -Is anybody there? -No, no one at all. They’re all on the beach. -Why? -Memorial service for Dori. -Maybe it would be… -I could drive by now. -Dahir might show up. -I’ll catch up on you. I just need to check something. I came across something yesterday evening. -See you later. -Sara? You owe me an explanation. -Why? -I’m just saying, Yoram Rilli. What do you want to know about my old comrade? Yesterday when you felt the need to confess, why not about Yoram? He drove Zvia Meyer to her son, Uriel, yesterday. They seemed very familiar. Did you ask him if he knew anything about Dori? I’d have liked to, otherwise. No one’s stopping you. Things have moved on. I wanted to see the file on Yoram. But I couldn’t. Access denied. That’s usually only the case for informants or people in witness protection. Good morning. May I? You two are getting on my nerves. I wondered why you wanted to keep me away from Amakov. -Then I took a closer look at his file. -Yes? Yoram Rilli was your informant on Amakov. Correct? -What are you hiding? -Listen. Don’t get involved. He’s sitting by the sea with the others. I see. The hell I won’t. I’m going to the beach, where I hope to find Dahir. Go along. So? Are you coming? Or are you off again today? Where is he? Back there. The cops. Shit. I know that guy. He’s a friend of Yoram’s. Dahir? -He’s leaving. -Let’s go after him. Come on. Stop! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! -Away from the fence. -I’ve done nothing. -Come on, kneel down. -Okay. On the ground. Hands behind your back. Why did you run? Just because of us? No, because you killed Dori. -No, that’s not true. -Shut up. -Why would I kill him? -I’ll tell you why. -No, no, I didn’t kill Dori. -Shut the fuck up. Get up. -You work at Ibrahim’s, right? -He’s my uncle. He can tell you Dori was my friend. Hey, come on, come. Stay on your feet. Come on. Pull yourself… Breathe! Blok! An ambulance quick! Do you hear me? Breathe! I don’t know how you see it, but there are other ways… If you don’t come clean about Dahir right now, I’ll have this place shut down. Got that? And I’ll find a reason. It’s not that simple. And why not? Whose is it? -Whose is it? -Yoram. Yoram? Yoram Rilli. Your friend. Take him with you. His body’s pumped full of heroin. But he’s young and tough. He’ll pull through. Don’t blame yourself. You practically saved his life. By the way, we found this in his stomach. -What’s that? -It looks like a memory card. I recognize it from my own phone. -Thank you very much. -You’re welcome. My pleasure. -Thank you. -Good-bye. What happens now with Dahir? As soon as he’s fit, he’ll be in custody. Here. It needs to go to the lab now. Something may still be legible. What about Ibrahim? He’s keeping silent. Although Blok’s been working him. -But Dahir must have worked for him. -Illegally? Yeah, how else? So, want to hear what I’ve got on our friend? Uriel Meyer. Of course. This guy’s lived in this psychiatric facility for 12 years. He got stuck on some drug trip and turned schizophrenic. -Who pays for it? Health insurance? -You’re kidding. This is a private clinic. Payment is made by bank transfer. By a gentleman named Yoram Rilli. -Did you check him out? -War veteran. -He was decorated for his bravery. -Like Uriel Meyer. Exactly. He has a shooting range outside of town. He went bankrupt eight years ago and sold everything. Who to? -Uriel Meyer! Dori’s big brother. -Are you kidding me? It gets even better. A dozen apartments and office buildings, top locations, are registered under Uriel’s name. Including the penthouse where Yoram is registered. A rich man. When you checked his file to see if he had a record, access was denied. -How do you know? -I tried yesterday. But honestly, I don’t know if I want to know all this. -I’ll drive you home. -No, I need to talk to Blok. He’s with the owner of the ship where we found Dori’s blood. What’s his name? Yoram Rilli. Do you want a go? I almost killed a man in an arrest today. I worked him till he couldn’t go on. Know what the worst part is? I had no pity, and if my colleagues hadn’t come… You’re getting old Blok, sentimental. -The war changed us all. -How did it change you, Yoram? It brought the best out in me, I think. Before the war, I was a bank clerk, remember? Better than drug dealer. And what are you? A cop. You always have been. Sitting on your high horse. You sent us out to kill. Do you remember? -I was following orders. -You were our commanding officer! Our father. -Our brother. -That’s ages ago. Don’t make it so easy on yourself. I’m guessing Dori figured out what you did to his brother. That you kept giving him drugs after he was released. And when he had turned into a vegetable after his breakdown, you used him to launder your dirty drug money. Too bad Dori became a do-gooder. What did he want? Money for his club? What did he have on you? Why did you have to kill him? Dori wanted to destroy me. I couldn’t let that happen. Now that I’m finally putting all you taught me to good use. So you’re running Amakov’s activities. You put me on him back then. Remember? A whole year of lies and deception in the service of justice. -I learned a lot from you. -That’s when you shot Amakov’s son. I did you a favor, admit it. Don’t you feel any guilt at all? You hypocrite. Blok, come back when you’ve had a drink. Sober you’re unbearable. The war is over, Yoram. For you, maybe. And don’t forget: You showed me how to kill. Uriel came home addicted to heroin. We tried cold turkey, but it only got worse. But then his comrade Yoram put him in the care home. Do you know about a shooting range Uriel bought from Yoram eight years ago? -What? -Did you give Yoram power of attorney? Maybe when Uriel was admitted to this care home. Once maybe. I don’t remember. Yoram was the only friend my son had left. He wasn’t his friend. Could Dori have found out anything incriminating about Yoram? Why do you suspect him? He took care of Uriel. Not like the others. -What others? -From his unit. Especially this Blok. He denied there was drug abuse in his unit. That’s why we didn’t get any help from the army. They just said he was an addict before he was drafted. -Who said that? -All in his unit. Ehud, Ofer, even that pianist. David? David Shapiro? Yeah, he didn’t tell the truth either. At first, he took care of him. But later, Uriel wanted nothing to do with him anymore. Not even a few days ago when he performed at his home. Because of Jom HaScho’a. The music was beautiful. Bravo. That sounds much better. This is my wife, Sara. She looks like she has something to tell me. Five-minute break, okay? But first, my thanks to Omar. I’m really glad he’s back with us. Bravo, Omar. I thank Juliet for playing second violin again without much grumbling. Thank you from all of us. Okay, five-minute break. What’s the matter? Why didn’t you tell me you gave a concert for Uriel at the home? It was for everyone there. Uriel’s mother says you denied him support from the army. Because of some decoration. Is that true? A medal for extraordinary bravery? -Is that true! -Yeah. -It’s true. -What the fuck is this? What are you gawping at? After the boy’s death, things changed. I’ll take him down. Uriel had the worst problems. He started taking hard drugs. He became ice-cold. No orders were necessary anymore. He would shoot anything that moved. I didn’t know he got the drugs from Yoram. Why did you all lie when Zvia applied for support? Blok wanted us to get this medal. He probably thought it’d help us to forget. He was wrong. Like all of us. What should I have done? Betray them all? I don’t know. You have to tell Godin. That I believe Blok is protecting a murderer? I have nothing to prove it. Just a hunch. Maybe Yoram was just using him, like he does Zvia and Uriel. Was there anything else on the memory card? A few fragments. -Too much… -Stomach acid. It was in there too long. Should I come with you? That’s fine, thank you. How are you? So far so good. And now? I’ll take the 12,000 shekels and get flown out to Rwanda. I’m an unwanted intruder here. Why did you run off? What were you afraid of? Of your colleague. Who exactly? The man who caught me. He’s a friend of Yoram Rilli’s. And Yoram killed Dori. I’m sure of that. Let’s go. He says he needs to talk to you. Urgently. What do you think happened? Dori found out what Yoram was using the power of attorney for and confronted Yoram. But what for? Because of Uriel. And his mother. Maybe that’s how he wanted to finance Bet Noah. Why didn’t Dahir talk to us on the beach? He’s a fugitive. He thinks he can’t expect anything good from us. -And… -And what? He recognized you. He saw you and Yoram at Ibrahim’s. He thought you were his accomplice. That’s why he was so afraid of you. Will you talk to Godin or should I? We can’t do much with the video of the swallowed chip. It doesn’t prove anything. Unfortunately. But Dori was murdered. We’ve an illegal fugitive who’ll say anything in court to escape the noose. Not a chance. Then we set Yoram up. We persuade Zvia to meet him wearing a wire. Blok, you were his commanding officer. Think you can get a confession out of him? We’ll wire you up and we won’t be far. Yoram is a murderer. You know that. If we don’t stop him, he’ll keep going. Maybe this will do. Why did you have to kill him? Dori wanted to destroy me. I couldn’t let that happen. Now that I’m finally putting all you taught me to good use. You’re running Amakov’s activities. You put me on him back then. Remember? I learned a lot from you. Zvia, this is a surprise, come in. Come on. Sorry I’m on the phone, but I’ll be right with you. Make yourself at home. -I’ll let you know, okay? -Okay. Sniper 1 in position. Understood. Sniper 1 to command. Suspect in view. Roger. There’s another person in the apartment. Female, about 60. -Colorfully dressed. -Zvia. See you tomorrow. Okay. And she… wow… What? She’s pointing a gun at the target. Zvia? Target clearly in view. Awaiting orders. Shoot? No, wait. -Just for a few seconds, please. -Wait. Roger. Put that thing away. You’ll hurt yourself. You killed Dori. -Zvia, what is this? -Stop fucking with me. Do you hear? You were just using Uriel. And Dori found out. Unfortunately, your wonderful son, Zvia, was a self-righteous, stupid asshole. The idiot thought he could blackmail me. Who gave him that idea? Just tell me where he is so that I can at least bury him. How the hell should I know? Somewhere in the ocean. It’s big. Fuck, she shot. -What’s the matter? -Target is down. Woman moves away. Okay, I’ll take over. Zvia. He didn’t know where my son was. How can I bury him? How can Dori’s soul find peace? -Call an ambulance. -Come with me. Can you hear me? Yoram? Come with me. It’ll be all right. Yoram, you’ll be all right. -Want to make us fall asleep? -Why? I’m under the speed limit. You can do that when you’re alone. Jean, did you teach her this? -Would you go a little faster? -Yes, of course. Very good. Turn left at the intersection. Should she also park or… Why? It’s no different here to Berlin, right? Exactly. -Sorry, I’ve got to… -What the…? Sara? I don’t believe it, Jean. You always meet twice in life. -Did she learn that from you? -No. Call the police.
