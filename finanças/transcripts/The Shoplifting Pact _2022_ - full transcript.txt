Yeah, heather. Are you at the cabin? Yes, and I'm pretty sure someone followed me here. This is not okay anymore. After tonight, I'm out. No, no. Don't say that sherri. We need you, she needs you. You're a really important part of the team. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I need to tell someone before I'm in too deep. - I got to go. - Sherri, don't hang up. Sky, honey, it's time to get. Up. Morning, mom. Honey, how long have you been up? Oh, I don't know. A couple of hours. Sky. Did you get any sleep last night? Honey, you should have slept. I could say the same to you, mom. Hey, I slept. You know, it's rude to lie to your child, mother. I mean, it's not every day that your 17 year old daughter. Has her first day at school. I've been to school before, mom. Not since... Look, it's... It's going to take me some time to get comfortable with.. You being there by yourself. Mom, I'm not going to be by myself. Okay, without me. You're not going to start crying, are you? No. Well, not in front of you, at least. Relax, nic. She's got plenty of time. Here. Have something to eat. Maybe later. My stomach, it's all in knots. Good morning. Is this why you wanted me out of the house? Busted. You ready, hon? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Got your inhaler? Mm-hmm. And a backup in my bag. - Okay. - Alright, yeah. Bye. - Have fun. - Bye, dad. It's okay to be nervous. What makes you think I'm nervous? Mom, come on. Triggering anything from your fun-filled days here? Gosh, no. Honey, I can walk you in if you want. Because that wouldn't. Automatically make me a social pariah. Yeah. Oh, well, look who's using her sat vocabulary. Well, I was taught by the best. Everyone is going to love you, I promise. And if they don't, it's their loss. Okay. Hurry up! You're going to be late. Love you, mom. Love you. Bye. Hey, can you guys... Just completely ignore me? Sky? Marnie. I can't believe you're here. Trust me, neither can I. Wait, what are you doing here? Oh, my mom just wanted me to stay ahead academically. With college coming up next year. Sat prep, honors courses. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I practically had to. Pry the leash out of her hands. Well, I mean, that's just because she cares. Both your parents always have. I always thought you were lucky. Yeah. Yeah, I guess maybe I am. Over the last few years, I thought about reaching out. But I wasn't sure if you'd be mad about what happened. But I've really missed you. I missed you, too. Okay, well, great. I'll show you around. So, what's your first period? History. Oh, I'm sorry. Marnie. Please tell me that you did. The chem problems that are due today. I did the chem problems. Okay, let's try again. But this time without lying straight to my face. I'm sorry, heather. I tried to get them done last night, but my mom... Oh, my god, spare me the sob story. Of being mommy's shoulder to cry on. When another man dumps her. You're supposed to be the responsible one. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I overslept. Way to let the team down, mar. Why do I know you? Heather, you remember Skylar? Oh, my god. Shut up. You know, I'm not going to lie. I really thought you'd let yourself go, But you look pretty good. Thanks. You look so good, too. Thanks for noticing. It's crazy what being called canned ham all of middle school. Will do to a girl's motivation. Wait, you're the girl that almost died on the playground? Yeah, your face got all red and you couldn't breathe. You forgot your. Inhaler. Right. And they had to call the ambulance. That was so embarrassing for you. Tabby. Was that one of the things that we talked about. That I shouldn't say out loud? Yes, sweetie. I didn't lose it. Someone hid it. Okay. So... Still into all that computer stuff? Yeah. Great. Failing computer sciences. So I could really use someone like you. Like a tutor? God, no. I just need someone to do the work for me. So I can stay on the basketball team. Oh, well, I'm not going to help you cheat. I thought you wanted to make friends. You better watch who you cross, sweetie. We're going to be late for class. - Heather turned into a... - Monster? Yeah, but remember. How we used to get picked on in middle school? That doesn't happen with heather around. - Is that... - Trey. Didn't you used to have a thing for him? I don't think middle schoolers can have a thing. I doubt he remembers me. Trust me, you don't want him to. Okay. Heather. Who was that? Just some new girl. Why? You want me to hook you up? So, how's the sherri situation? Did she run away? It's really none of your concern. Sure, I'm just protecting my investment. Wait, you still haven't heard from sherri? Trey, don't you have a class to go fail or something? Try it. Hello, principal skinner. Do you know this girl? We got to go. I'm sorry. Marnie, open up. - Shoot it tabby. - No way. Yes. Keep it moving. You're okay, hun? You look a little lost. Are you trying out for the alternate? Oh, no. I'm just here to see marnie. We're hanging out after practice. Watch the pick, watch the pick. Keep going. You got it. My girls are good, huh? Nice. Sky. You came. Coach sandy, this is sky. She's one of my oldest friends. Is it okay if she stays for practice? Yeah, of course. Thank you, miss... Evans. But you can call me coach sandy. Just don't tell the principal. Sky. So good to see you again. Thanks. Marnie, it was such a good idea to bring. Sky in to be the new scorekeeper. - Oh, I didn't. - The what? Coach sandy, sky is brilliant. When it comes to computers and numbers. I think she'd make a good fit to keep the stats. At least while sherri is out. Are you interested, sky? Sports aren't really sky's thing. Can I think about it? Don't take too long. You'd be a really important part of the team. See you. Heather. Marnie. I didn't know you were still in here. Is that sherri's locker? Yes, I guess it is. What are you looking for? Not that it's any of your business, but my eyeliner. She borrowed it and I wanted it back. Do you happen to know her combo? No. Hey, I saw her mom talking to the principal. And she looked terrible. Should we be worried? Look, sherri wanted out. I'm sure she's just avoiding us at her dad's or something. But... As far as I'm concerned, there is no sherri. All right, let's go. Let's get the team together. We have to do another one. Marnie. Let's go. Okay. Ready? Look at this. Good afternoon, ladies. How can I help you today? My best friend here needs a stunning dress. For her after baby trip to Monaco. Congratulations. Thank you. - What's your name? - Julie. Julie. Wow, that is such a gorgeous name. So, Julie, we're going to browse around a bit. But the second I find something, Can I track you down and try it on? - Of course. - Thanks so much, hun. Yeah, I'll see you later. Hi, can I help you? Yeah, wow. I don't know if I could afford any of this. It's a little expensive for me. Do you have a clearance rack? It's in the back. Oh, wait. I love this. What do you think? Or maybe this one? Or maybe this shirt. One or the other. I really love the color. They'd both be very nice on you. They're very expensive. Thanks so much, Julie. But none of it really worked out for us, though. Thanks, Julie. - Oh, thank you, ladies. - Bye. Give me your opinion on this one. That was a great one. We got so much good stuff. We must have at least five grand. What are we going to do with all this stuff? Sherri is the one that knew how to sell online. I'm sorry, who? Yeah, last I checked, I already found a replacement, remember? We can't bring sky into this. What would I even tell her? I don't know. Just make something up. And quick, we have a deadline. Let's go. I've been looking for you guys. Miss Clark. Girls... Please tell me you know where she is? I'm sorry, we don't. I don't care what you girls have been up to. I just want to know that sherri's okay. Wait, we thought she was just out sick or something. Is she really missing? Yes. There was a note in her room this morning saying. She had to leave town. She's 16. Why would she have to leave town? - I don't know. - If you girls know anything, Please tell me. Tell me. We don't. We promise. I'm sorry. We have to go. I know you girls were up to something with sherri. If you won't help me, maybe the police will. Her mom talked to the cops? We heard tabby. Well, what if they can't find her? What if they start asking us questions? What are we going to do then? Tabatha. Enough. Let's get out of here. Go. Need some help? Hey. Yeah, sure. I thought when you started school again I was going to lose my assistant. Never, mom. Sky. How was your first day back? It's pretty much what I expected. Oh, honey, it'll get better tomorrow. I mean, first days of school, they're always tough. Did yours get any better? Yeah. Eventually. You are incredible. Any of those girls would be lucky to have you as a friend. What if you join a club or some sort of team. There's got to be one that lines up with your interests. Tech club, math club. Well, there was a team I was considering. What team? Basketball. - Oh, honey. - No, don't worry. It's just score keeping. I won't be stepping foot on the court. I don't know. I just I know, mom. I'm your miracle baby. I get it. But it won't be dangerous at all. Please, mom. Okay. All right. Just be careful. Please. The doctor... Mom, it's just score keeping. Okay, fine. Just make sure that it doesn't interfere with your schoolwork. She's going to make her teachers proud, Just like she did with you. Yeah. You are going to be the best scorekeeper they've ever had. Is sandy still coaching? Coach sandy? Yeah. You know her? Yeah, We were in the same class. And were you friends? In the beginning? Yeah, we were. Later there were issues. You know, your mom and I can come to your games. Oh, you don't have to do that. It's not like I'm going to be really doing anything. You'll be an important part of a team, And we want to support that. Thanks dad. - Tabby, three. - Talk it out. Alright. That's okay. That's okay. Okay. Keep it moving. Keep the hustle. Keep the hustle. Marnie. Open up. Open up. Sky, does this mean you are helping out? If you'll still have me. I don't want to step on any toes with sherri's back in school. No, she's still out. But just hang on the sidelines. And I'll show you what to keep track of. Okay? No. No. Here. Right here. Tabby, open up, over here. Catch it marnie. Yay! You just have to conjugate the verb here. It will either be reflexive or a negative conjugation. It's not that hard once you get the hang of it. God, you're a lifesaver. I didn't think you took french. Oh, I don't. Heather does. This is her homework. Mar. I'm working the second shift at the hospital. Oh, I didn't know you had company. Mom, you remember sky. Oh, my gosh, of course. Hi, hon. So good to see you. How's your mom? She's good. Great. Well, tell her I said hi. It's just so good to see you girls hanging out. Yeah, sky is doing score keeping for the team. That's great. We actually have a game this Friday. You said you would maybe make it. It's the one up against Reagan high. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I completely forgot. I can't cancel my plans now, So I'll get the next one. Sure. Okay, I better get to work, but you guys have fun. So good to see you. Your mom seems like she's doing okay. Today, at least. It's the first time I've seen her all week. She works a lot? Yeah, she's not even here when she's here, But it's fine. Oh, my god. I can't believe you still have this. Yeah, of course I do. It's from your grandparent's cabin, right? You remember? Yeah, I remember the hide and seek. I mean that was epic up there. Yeah. Oh, I almost forgot. I need to ask you for a huge favor. Yeah, what is it? Wow. Where did you get all this stuff? Most of it's heather's. Stuff she's never worn. And doesn't plan on wearing. - Must be nice. - Right? None of it fits me. And the rest of it is for my mom's last ex. He was a real creep. He thought buying me gifts would win me over. Anyways, do you think you could help me sell it? Like, on marketplace or something? Yeah, or something. My mom and I share all our accounts, And I really don't want her to know about it, So I'm looking for something a little more. Untraceable. There's like, sites for that, right? Oh. Yeah. They're just not always the safest places. To go digging around. And this stuff looks like it's worth a small fortune. Yeah. My mom was kind of banking on me. Getting a basketball scholarship for college, and. It doesn't look like that's happening. So -oh. I'm sorry. So, you'll help me? Yeah, of course. You are a great friend sky. Who is it? Just wait right here. I'll be right back. Okay. - What the hell? - Excuse me? All of this is your fault. You have any idea what kind of trouble... What are you doing? Stop. Good luck sweetheart. Better watch your back. What was that? Trey's been asking me out all year and I keep saying no. Trey doesn't respond well to no. - Bye. - Bye. And thanks for selling the clothes. Sky. There you are. I was worried sick about you. I'm sorry. I didn't think that you'd still be up. What, you think I'd go to bed. When my 16 year old daughter is out past her curfew. On a school night? Not answering her texts? I'm sorry. Wait. I have a curfew. You do now. Okay. Goodnight. Okay. No. Okay, close. I'm just too stupid for this stuff. Don't get frustrated. All right? Just one step at a time. Let's try again. Right? Why do I even have to learn algebra? I'm not going to need it. Well, I'm sorry. You need it. To stay on the team and to graduate. Hey, I just need a c. Hey, you're better than a c. You have all sorts of a+ potential. Okay? So don't call my friend, stupid. Deal? Thanks, coach. Hey, sky, what's up? Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Oh, no, I was going to be late for class anyways. Cool. - See ya. - See ya. I just wanted to drop off some stats I've been working on. All right. Wow. These look great. You're becoming an integral part of the team. You should be proud of yourself. Thanks. I'm just excited to be a part of an awesome team. Sky, You're a bright girl. Stay out of trouble, okay? What's up? Nothing. These are all from heather? Yeah. She said I could take whatever I wanted, But none of this stuff is really my style. I don't know how any of this stuff can't be someone's style. Well, you know, This would look so good on you. I'm sure heather wouldn't mind if you took something. I mean, especially since you are one of us now. Really? Yeah. You're the best. Thanks, marnie. Sky. Honey, are you in here? Sky. - Hey. - Mom. Sorry, I was just getting some stat inputs for the team. Okay. Why are you acting so weird? I am not. Sky. You know that you can tell me anything, right? I mean, you used to tell me everything. Yeah, I know. Do you need something? No, I just I just want you to know that I'm here if you want someone to talk to. Okay. Bye. Okay. They are shoplifting? Nicole. Hi. How are you? Come, sit down. I'm okay. It has been a while. Yeah, yeah, it sure has. Well, I really love having your daughter. Helping out on the team. She's such a sweetheart. Thank you. That's actually why I'm here. About sky. Is everything okay? Is she...? Listen, I just feel like I need to say all that stuff. That happened between us back then. Yeah, I've moved past that. We're good. Okay. Nicole. I'm glad you're here. And I'm glad you said something. It took me some years to realize it. Because I was dealing with my own stuff, but I treated you terribly junior year. And I would like to say I'm sorry. It wasn't just you. No, but I was captain of the team. And the other girls took my queue. I knew you wanted to be a part of the team. And I shouldn't have been so cruel. Dangling it in front of you like that. And then taking it away. I am... Embarrassingly sorry, Nicole. Those high school girls, They really know how to stick a dagger under your heart. Which brings me back to sky. Have you noticed anything going on with her at school? With the girls on the team? I'm worried that maybe they're bullying her. Like we bullied you? No. Nothing like that. Or not that I've seen. But I'll keep a lookout, Nicole. I promise. I never got to have kids like you did. But these girls are my kids. I've got her back. And I'll let you know if I see anything. Thank you, sandy. What are you doing? You can't wear the merch here. Heather is going to kill you. Plus, you're going to get us caught. Sorry. Oh, hey. Hey, sky. What's up? Can we talk? Alone? Yeah. Yeah. What is this? Sky, I'm so sorry. I'm not stupid, marnie. I know you guys stole that stuff. I don't think you're stupid. I wouldn't have stolen it if it wasn't for a good reason. You have to understand. A good reason, marnie? Are you serious? What's going on? Something's wrong? No, it's bigger than this. There's a lot involved. I wouldn't just steal for no reason. Marnie. We can't let her ruin everything. Come on. Let me guess. You're in on this too. I don't know what you're talking about. She knows about the clothes, heather. The clothes that you've been hawking on the dark web? The clothes that are still in your possession? Those clothes, sky? Yeah, but I didn't know where they were from. Didn't you? I mean tabby and Vera overheard you. Bragging about stealing them. Didn't you, girls? - Sure did. - Yeah. What? There is no point in pretending. So you're all in on this? Well, I mean, we just really wanted to... We just really wanted some brand new clothes. Some nice ones with some extra spending cash. You of all people should understand. Wanting to fit in with a clean slate. I know you don't have to steal, heather. Yeah, well, maybe not me, but. The rest of the girls aren't as lucky. And I look out for my team, Which now includes you. Yeah. Well, I quit. That's so sweet sky, But it's a little too late. So I suggest you just shut up, fall in line. And do your job, okay? Sky, don't ruin this for the rest of us. We're just having some fun. Actually, Sky can quit if she wants. - What? - Yeah. She can just go back to being some home schooled freak. Who sits alone at lunch. Looking like a bargain rack barbie. Oh, and if the cops show up at her house. After some hot tip about. Where to find some stolen merchandise, well I think her parents would understand. Right? So, you're in or you're out? It's your choice. Jeez. Don't you have that inhaler thing or whatever? All right, so, can the team count on you or not? Yeah. I'm in. Great. That's the team spirit. See you later. Don't. Mom. Mom. Mom. Honey. Hey, are you okay? Have you been crying? No. It's just allergies. Sweetie, If there's something going on in school, You know, you can tell me. Mom. The girls on the basketball team. They... Oh, my gosh. I wonder how that happened. I'm sorry, honey. You were saying about the girls on the team. They're great. The girls on the team are really great friends. Why would sky lie to you? I don't know, kev, but she did. She's hiding something. And I think it has something to do with. These girls on the basketball team. Maybe... You're overreacting because they're sandy's girls. What? No. I did go to see her today. Sandy? - Why? - I just. Thought maybe whatever is going on with sky. And the girls on the team, maybe Sandy would know something about it. Is sky in trouble? I don't know, But... Something is affecting her. She's jumpy all the time, and. That's not our sky. Do you want to pull her out of school? No. I don't know. Maybe. I don't want to be one of those parents. Who ignores all the signs until it's too late. I just wanted to say that I'm so sorry, sky. Save it, okay? There's a lot that you don't know about. Heather doesn't want to tell you yet, But I promise that there's a good reason. A good reason for shoplifting? Yes. And you'll know soon enough. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. Thought you could use something warm right now. Thanks, dad. You always know when I need something before I do. Hey, I know you're almost all grown up, but I'm here if you want to vent. Or cry. Or do yard work together like we used to. Thanks, dad. Yeah. See you kiddo. May I help you? Yes, I'm looking for something for my granddaughter. That isn't too flashy, More understated. We've got some options. Be right with you. Maybe in a soft pink. Would that be pretty for this pretty? Start with the jewelry. Good idea. Thank you. Did you want to try that on, hon? Actually, you don't have my size. But I did see this belt, And I'm wondering if you can ring it up for me. - Of course. - Thank you. Great choice. $29.95 cash or credit? Hey. You almost forgot this. Oh! Silly me. Wow. Thank you so much. So welcome. So, we were wondering... What's going on? Skylar, please, come sit down. You want to tell us where that came from? Yeah. It's a gift. For coach sandy. All the girls on the team wanted to pitch in. And get her something nice for her birthday, And I picked it up after practice. Then why was it hidden in your closet? Because I didn't want to just leave it out. Where anything could happen to it. I can't believe you guys have been snooping around my room. When I wasn't home. Honey, we're worried about you. Your mom just want to make sure everything was okay. That doesn't mean you can invade my privacy. Just stay out of my business. Well, that went well. I don't know. Something is wrong. Do you think they believed you? I think so. Sky, are we okay? I don't know how to answer that right now. Look, your friendship means a lot to me. I never wanted you to get caught up in this. I didn't have a choice, just like you. You always have a choice. Marnie. Tell me what is going on. Marnie, tell me. Heather would kill me. Mom. Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing here? Well, I work here now. I'm sorry, what? Surprise. I'm just volunteering in the office. Hi marnie, it's good to see you, sweetie. You, too. I've been trying to get in touch with your mom. She's impossible to get a hold of. Yeah, tell me about it. Mom, are you trying to keep tabs on me? No. Not at all. Honey, you won't even know that I'm here. Okay, I'm going to leave you girls to it. Keep open. Shoot it. Okay, all right. Get over there. Sky, what is she doing here? I don't know. I can't believe you brought sky into this. She's not one of us. Should have never agreed to let you girls help me. What was I supposed to do? I mean, we needed someone like her, And sherri just went up and disappeared. And she's not even responding to anyone. Sherri? The principal just told me that. They haven't heard from sherri's mother either. The police are involved now. Sky's mom just asked me. How I liked the new bag the team got me. That's good thinking, sky. She's really quick on her feet. No, no. That's sloppy, heather. I should have just has taken responsibility. For all of this already. God, I just didn't know what to do. This has all gotten... Way out of control. I mean, we only need one more shopping trip, And then it can all be over forever. I'm the adult. This was my mistake. They should be my consequences. Please... End it now. What are you going to do about the rest of the money? I mean, honestly, coach, they don't pay you anything here. There's absolutely no way you're going to get it. It'll all be over soon. You guys have been lying to me and manipulating me, And I've been an idiot to let you do it. - Keep it down. - For what? A bunch of fancy clothes? And with my mom here now, I won't be able to hide anything from her. You can have all the clothes and the passwords to the accounts. I'm done. Heather, tell her. Okay, yeah, sky, we've been lying to you. But it's not like we really had a choice either. The money, the clothes, it's not for us. It's for coach sandy. Okay? She needed money and we're protecting her. From what? Coach sandy's husband was her high school sweetheart, And he was killed in a car crash. Oh, my god. Yeah, she was obviously hurting. Went out one night and met up with some hot 22 year old guy. Spent the night with him. Just for some comfort and to ease her mind. That's not a crime. No, but when school started a couple of months later, She was teaching one of her classes. And who walks in but that hot 22 year old? Except he wasn't 22. He was 18. He lied to her. It was trey. Oh. But what about the shoplifting? Trey is blackmailing her for 50k. Coach sandy's a high school teacher. She doesn't have any way to make that money. Yeah, I overheard her in the office. Crying on the phone one day. She told me everything. She's the best coach we've ever had. She's always had our back. We couldn't let him ruin her life. You have to go to the cops or something. Tell them what trey is doing. That's such a good idea, sky. I mean, why didn't we just think of that one, marnie? Oh, yeah, because trey won't be the one that gets into trouble. It'll be coach sandy. She could get fired or worse. We need you, sky. Coach sandy needs you. We're not just a team. We're family. Family, huh? Which one of my family snuck into my house the other day and. Threatened my mom and me? What are you talking about? It was probably trey, obviously. I mean, he has more of a reason for you. To sell the clothes than we do. Don't worry, sky. I got your back. Only as long as you have ours. No, don't give me, I think so, Is she going to do it or not? We need that money. I know. It's just I can't stay in that house any longer with my dad. It's getting bad. I'll call you later, baby. I love you. Hey, gorgeous. Stay away from me. You know, I remember you, Skylar. Middle school? You had the biggest crush on me. Didn't you? Sent me all those candy grams for valentine's day? It was cute. Yeah, well, I used to eat glue as a kid, So I'd say I'm pretty good. At purging toxic traits out of my system. Oh, she's witty too... What do you want, trey? I heard your mom's been snooping around. Even found some of the merch. Yeah, well, she has a lot to be suspicious of, don't you think? I'm just saying, You're the new sherri, right? The last I heard, sherri just vanished. Rumor has it, Her mom's gone, too. Maybe she skipped town to look for sherri, or I don't know. Maybe something else. Are you threatening me? Trust me, candygram. When I make an actual threat, You won't have to question it. You wanted to see me? Yeah. Take a seat, sky. Am I in trouble or something? No, not at all. You're a bright kid. All your honors courses and computer literacy. You probably don't need any. Extra curriculars for your college application. Maybe not, but it never hurts. Well, I was taking a look at your course schedule, And I have no idea how you're making it to every practice. Look, you have done a great job filling in, But if you wanted to prioritize. Other things for the rest of the season, The team would understand. Coach sandy, are you firing me? No, Of course not. I just don't want you to get overwhelmed with everything. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. I appreciate your concern, but I have to stay. Well, I guess if that's what you want, We're happy to have you. That's a beautiful ring. Yeah. Skylar, Never be afraid to realize when it's time to move on. And not let something drag you down anymore. Okay. Thanks. Sandy. Nicole. Listen. I wanna... You're worried about sky? Yeah. Lately, she has been slipping. I spoke with a few of her teachers. And they said that her grades are down, And I think that she is being spread too thin. I'm so sorry. That is unacceptable. I hold my girls to very high academic standards. Yeah, But I get a sense. As good as your girls are, Maybe they're just not healthy for my daughter. She's acting strange at home. It's not sky. Nicole, possibly the team isn't the best environment for sky. Okay. It would be okay if you wanted to pull her off the team, Encourage her to make new friends. Maybe even forbid her from seeing the girls on the team. I mean, if her grades are slipping, I think that might be the right thing to do. Thanks, sandy. Off the team? Mom. Sky, I put you in that school for academics. I don't want your grades suffering. I can get my grades back up. There's just a lot you don't understand. Sky, don't get worked up. You never wanted me to actually make friends. - Sky. - Honey, come on. You know that's not true. Isn't it? Take a breath. I'm fine. Honey, you're going to get your asthma. I'm fine. Okay, listen, Maybe these just aren't the right friends for you. Whatever they've got you involved in, If it's bad, you can tell us. You have no idea what you're talking about. You're suffocating me. You never would have spoken to me like that. Before you met them. What happened to my sweet little girl? I grew up. Mom. Just let me stay on until the end of the season, please. There's just a lot going on. I have to stay. This is not a negotiation, sky. You're done. Immediately. No, mom. - Honey. - Sky. Just relax. I'm okay. You just don't understand. I can't quit the team. Then talk to us. Tell us exactly what has been going on with you. What have these girls gotten you into? It's not just me. It's who. Is one of them bullying you? If you tell us, we can help you. Fine. Fine. You win. I'll quit tomorrow. Sky, wait. Shouldn't she be here by now? Where is she? She was in class today, right? Yeah. I had second period with her. She should be here. Hey. You saw all the last haul? Yeah, it's all gone. How close are we? Okay. Yeah. We just need to do one more and then we're good. You'll have to do it without me. You don't think you actually have a choice now, right? Threaten me all you want. I made a promise to my mom. What are we going to do? We need her to sell everything. Fix it. Now. Sky, wait. No, marnie. I'm out. I'm done. Okay? Just leave me alone. You can't quit. Whoever is behind this is breaking into my house, Threatening my family. It's gotten way out of hand. I'm telling them everything. If you do that, then they'll go to the police, And this whole thing falls apart, And coach sandy could go to jail. I don't have the kind of relationship. You have with your mom, marnie. My mom knows everything about me. I can't just hide this from her. Marnie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean. No, you're right. My mom doesn't know anything about my life. But coach sandy does. And the girls on the team do. I'm sorry, but I'm telling my parents. - Sky, you can't. - Why not? Because sherri said the same thing to me. The last time that I saw her. And now she's gone. I'll be home in about 15 minutes. Did Skylar come straight home from school? Yeah. I feel bad. Yeah, I know, Kevin. I feel bad, too. But if you've seen the look on coach sandy's face, You'd know we're doing the right thing. I'll see you soon. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Where are the keys? No. No. No. Call Kevin. Nicole. Nicole. Nicole, are you there? Nicole! Honey, are you okay? What was that? Nicole, answer me! The police think that it was an attempted mugging. Did they take anything? They grabbed my purse. The police found it a few blocks away, but. It doesn't look like anything was missing. Hey, guys. It's sherri. Tell me everything. Bye. Alright. Alright. Come on, guys. Come on guys. Open up. What's the problem? Nothing. You look nervous. Why are you nervous? I'm anxious to get this over with. God marnie. We all are. It's our last one. Just keep focused. Call her back later. Okay. Stay here. We'll be right back. Sky. Marnie, I found it. - Found what? - Sherri's phone. It was in heather's jacket. Heather killed her. She's dangerous, marnie. What should we do? Sky, where are you right now? At school. Okay, you're right. This is getting to be too much. And we're going to go to the police. Okay, good. But we need to protect coach sandy. Okay? All the money from the heist, Are they still on the online bit coin accounts. Yeah. Okay. We can't let heather get at it. We need to change the pin. Can you do that? Yeah. Okay. Good. Come meet me. We need to figure out what to do next. I'm at the mall. Yeah, of course. Hey. Stop them. Stop them. Go. Wait, where's marnie? She's gone. What? What's going on? - Keep going. - Stop. Stop. Stop. So, it was you. Trey. Marnie. I'm sorry, sky. Sometimes you really don't have a choice. Voicemail again. Can you call someone else? And maybe one of her friends? I can call Becky and see if she's with marnie. Hi, this is Becky. Dammit. I'm going to go to the school and see if she's there. We'll go together. I'll drive. Thank you. Heather. Heather. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Tabby. Tabby. What happened? Marnie. Marnie, what? I always thought someone on the team was stealing from us, But I couldn't figure out who. It was marnie. What? Wait. What are you doing? We have to go. We have to go warn coach sandy. Don't move. Keep your hands where I can see them. Sandy. Sandy. Nicole, you were right about the stealing. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. Where's sky? - I don't know. - Sandy, where is guy? Where is she? I don't know. I'm sorry. I really don't know. Okay. Okay. Oh, Nicole. - Is sky here? - How are you? Is sky here? No, I haven't seen her. What about marnie? Do you know where she is? She's not here. Do you know about the shoplifting? - The what? - The girls. The girls on the basketball team. They're on the news. Their coach just got arrested. No, that can't be right. Marnie would never be involved in something like that. Do you have any idea where they might go if they wanted to hide? My parents cabin. She'd run away there a lot during the divorce. - Okay, let's go. - What? You're coming with me. It's just the turn off the road, a couple more miles up. Oh, god. I hope the girls are okay. Hi, sky. Hey, candygram. Trey. What are you doing here? Wait, marnie? You two, together? Marnie, let me go. I can't do that. Not yet. The online accounts have a new pin. And you need to give it to me. Okay, sky. Is that what this is about? Money? No. Not really. What has he gotten you into? Give me some more credit than that, sky. I got him into this. This was all my idea. But he seduced coach sandy. She's not some kind of martyr, sky. But she didn't know. She was supposed to care about us. About me. I thought I found the one woman in my life who supported me. And then she goes and sleeps with my boyfriend. She's a fake, just like the rest of them. You don't have to do this. I don't have your perfect grades, Or your loving mother. Who would do anything for you. And I don't have heather's talent. I was going to be trapped here. And when trey slept with sandy, I saw an opportunity. I saw my way out. I don't understand. Not all of us want to end up. At some second rate community college. With a dad who doesn't return your calls. Because he went and had a new family. Or a mom who doesn't have any time for you. All that money won't erase this. It will get me out of this town, And away from these people. I can start somewhere else with a clean slate. And trey, he needs this just as badly as I do. He and I, we understand each other. Trey. I love her. It must be nice... To go through the day and not see all the people. Who are struggling just to get by. You never realized how lucky you are, sky. You think your parents are overprotective? Some of us would kill for that kind of love. You are gonna hurt me? No. I don't want to. I don't want to hurt you, sky. But I didn't want to hurt sherri, either. Did you kill sherri? You were always the smart one. Now, just give me the pin number. What did you do to sherri? I did what I had to do. Now, please give me the pin numbers, sky. Sky, honey, what is going on? Where are you? Mom, I'm at marnie's cabin. Mom, I think she wants to kill me. What? Who? - Marnie. - No. Look, sky, listen to me. We will be there as soon as we can, baby, okay? You find a safe place to hide. - Do you hear me? - Please. Hurry. I don't know much longer I have. Sky, can you hear me? Drive faster. Go. Lose something? Marnie. I like you, sky. That's why I tried to warn you to stay away from all this. And you wouldn't listen to me. I just wanted to be a part of the team. You betrayed them. I'm a punching bag to them, sky. They all think that I'm a joke. You just need some help. Okay. We can fix this. Don't you think, I've been to therapy. Sky. It's safe to say it didn't work. I'm sorry, sky. Marnie. Oh, my god. Sky. - Mom. - Sky. Get away. What are you doing here? I came here to help, honey. Whatever your friends got you involved in, we can fix it. We can fix it together. No. You don't get to pretend like you care now. Where are you when I needed you? It's too late for that. I'm so sorry. Do you have any idea what I've done? Baby. Trey. No. Honey, look. Your mother and I just want to help you. Look, marnie. Marnie, please. Your mom and I are just trying to help you. Your mom loves you. No, she doesn't. No. Sky. Sky, baby. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Marnie. Thank you. Hey, the police talked to coach sandy and heather, And they explained how you got pulled into all this. It's over now, baby. - Hi. - Hey. Bye, mom. Bye, dad. Wait, slow down. Sorry, I'm just running late for volunteering. Wait, I thought you finished. Your community service last week. I did. I want to help other girls stay on the right track. Well, did you finish your homework? Yes. Homework is done, Spreadsheets are uploaded, Room is clean, And laundry is folded. Anything else? Sounds like you thought of everything. Before you go, you got mail. Oh. It's from the fbi leadership program. What does it say? I got accepted to do the summer session. Hey, I guess hacking in the dark web has its perks. Way too soon, dad. Honey, we are so proud of you. Thanks, mom. Oh, I won't be home too late. I promise. It's okay. I trust you. Oh, did you forget your... Got it. - Bye. - Bye.
