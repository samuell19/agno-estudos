- Nan Moore. Well I'm sorry, but I don't believe you hold the proper ranking for what you're suggesting. David, this is not a private line. Well watch what you're saying. I'm trying to get out of here. I'll see you later. Good, bye I'm so sorry dear. - Oh, overtime? - Oh, they have to pass a special bill to keep me here today. - Two more minutes Nan, remember tax payer's dollars. - Good God, is it Friday? Have I missed something? - Could it be a date? Is there something you'd like to tell us dear? - Well, actually ladies and gentlemen, I do have a few choice words. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, and tell John to have a great year. - Oh, I will. Thanks, bye. - John? John? John, you better start cleaning up. - I've got to finish this. - You're so compulsive. - Well. I'm going to be gone for a whole year, and I am not going to leave this half painted. That's my shirt Elizabeth. - Looks great, doesn't it? - Yeah. I ironed it. - John, feel free to borrow anything of mine you want. That's what sisters are for. John? John, don't you dare. Don't come near me with that. John. It's your shirt. - That's my point exactly. - You're dripping. - Oh, look what you did. - Me? - Yeah, I was doing just fine until I saw you running off with my clothes. - Oh well I'm not so sure about that. I mean, look, you missed a spot right here. John, this entire wall needs another coat. Fine mess you left us in Oly. Off to China, leaving us with only half a wall painted. - No. - John, I'm really sorry. John, I am really sorry. John. I am really sorry. John. - I'm gonna get you. - John, stop it please. I said. I' said I'm sorry. - Are you? - Yes. - Peace. - Okay. I'm going to be sweating midterms and finals and you're gonna be living the life of Riley in Beijing. - I don't think that there is a life with Riley in Beijing. - Well it must be great to have all your studying over with. - Well, I'll be back in a year and you can tell me how you sailed through college. Elizabeth. Hey. You have the brains and you have the ability. - Not now John. - Hey, how many times do I have to tell you, you don't have to stack yourself up against anybody else. - Right. I have a sister with a degree in economics. A brother with a law degree from an Ivy League school, thank you very much. - I see your problem. Hey. It is exciting. You're moving on to a new point in your life. - I guess. It is. - Mom's gonna be lonely you know. You're the last one to leave. - I think she's looking forward to being alone. She gets to spend some time with David. - Well I don't care what kind of front she puts up, she raised four kids in this house, and now she's gonna be by herself. Just, you take care of her Elizabeth. - I will. Alright, come on, let's go. They're probably waiting for us. - He is flying high above the dinner table. Superman. - Thank you. - I think I'll have the shishkabob. - Thank you. - I wouldn't. - Why not mother? - Because I've had the pasta and I think you'll enjoy it more. You think this is hard now, but you're gonna miss me telling you what to do. - I'm sure it'll take some getting used to. I'm just kidding. - Oh yeah, right there. Now listen, competition is keen. Grade point average is important, extra curricular activities are a must. I cannot emphasize this enough. - John, why don't you give the kid a night off. - There are no nights off in the quest for excellence. Remember, Handover, Columbia, Princeton. Law school. - He must be feeling pretty cocky about the law boards if you're still pushing law school. - Oh boy, ask me in a few months when I get those results. - Well, maybe he should be just a little bit cocky. - Well that's it mother, encourage him. - I'm not ashamed to be proud and neither should you John. I mean you graduated from the finest schools and you've done it with honors. - Thank you. - Well I don't want to put a damper on the evening, but, it's gonna be a very sparse life in China. - Oh mom, he's only going away for a year. It's not forever. - I'm sorry, it's just, it's just a long time since I had a cry. - My brother Ben died of cancer. He was only 17. - Well, those were different tears. - No, Ben would never have wanted his mother to cry, not at a moment like this. No. No. No, he probably would have put a puppet on his lap and said something like Ma, loosen up. Everybody's here ma, the whole family is here. - Hold this for me will ya? - Are you going on a picnic? - Elizabeth and I have to drive all the way up to Connecticut tomorrow. - Do you think that's such a good idea? - Oh, we'll be fine. It's the nature of mothers and daughters to disagree about everything. It'll pass. It was the same with Mary. Do you want me to make you a sandwich to take on your trip? - Mother, it's a 45 minute shuttle to New York. - And then forever on to China. - Stop kicking yourself because you're taking Elizabeth. It's her first year. Besides, I don't need you to take me to the airport. - Wash that. - I think you should marry David. - And I think you should stay in Washington. - Wow. So much for that discussion. - I like him very much. Next topic. - I just want to make sure that you're taken care of. - I have a job. I don't need to be taken care of. Pretty 1980s, huh? - It's time that somebody started picking up the slack for you. - Take up the slack for me? John, I wish there was more that I could give. I wish it hadn't been so hard for all of you. - Mother, you taught us not to let those things get in our way. - Yes. I just want you to have time. Time to make choices, fall in love, get married. - You just want to get your hands on the grandchildren. - I have no shame. I can't wait. I'm gonna miss you. What are you doing here? - I just thought you might need some company. - Elizabeth and I argued all the way to Westmin, and we both cried when we had to say goodbye. - You think you'd have built up some callouses by now. - Got to me a bit. She's my baby. - We just have to remember to draw the drapes and we've got the whole house. - You're a maniac. - You did a terrific job with each of your kids. Got a whole new era ahead of you now. - You know, I've never lived in this house without the children. That's going to be very, very quite. - Not if I have anything to say about it. - I'm glad you're here. - Yes. I would like to change my reservation to Beijing from the 30th to the 31st. Is there a seat available? Okay, my name is John Moore. Yes, I would like to cancel and rebook for August 31st. Okay. Uh huh. Flight zero zero seven, leaving JFK at 11:50 PM. Okay, thank you very much. Okay. - Thank you very much for your help John. When you're in Beijing, I hope our people will extend themselves as you did. - Now are we clear on moxie? - We want our deposit refunded. - Very good. - Hello? John. Where are you calling from? Where are you? - I'm at Kennedy. I had to postpone a day. Some Chinese students had difficulty getting an apartment so I had to interpret. - Well don't they speak English? - Not landlord English. Did Elizabeth settle in okay? - Oh, yes. Yes, she's gonna be just fine. And it's such a beautiful campus. - That's great. Mother, you never told me that you liked the job that I did on half the garage. - Oh it was wonderful. You want to do the rest of the house? - I'll miss you. - I love you pal. - Flight oh oh seven for Seoul, Korea - Okay, I gotta go. - John, do you have a warm coat? - Don't worry about me. - I want to send you the brown pockets. It's not very pretty, but it's warm. - They're gonna leave if I don't go now mom. - Take care of yourself, John. - Okay, bye mom. - Bye. - Flight oh oh seven for Seoul, Korea. - Be good. Take care of your sister. - Is in its last boarding stages at Gate eight F. Rows one through 15, please board now. Please have your boarding passes ready. - Into Soviet air space. All reports at the present time indicate that the airliner was escorted by Russian fighter pilots and has been detained at a military base on Sakhalin Island. - Good morning Diane. - Good morning Nan. - Morning Charles. - Good morning Nan. How are you? - Nan. I haven't gotten the documentation yet from General Dynamics. - Oh. Well we'll put a tracer on it. - Oh, he's not in yet. Want to get some coffee? - Oh, sure. - Have you heard from John yet? - No. It'll take him a couple days to get settled in. - Pretty hair raising news this morning, huh? I bet there's big pow wows going over on the hill right now. - What are you talking about? - Haven't you read your paper this morning? - No, I was late getting started. - A Korean air lines flight was forced down over Russian. - When? - Last night. They just announced it this morning. Thank your lucky stars John left a couple days ago. - Not a commercial flight? - Yes, flight oh oh seven. Do you believe that name? Creepy huh. They say it's strayed. Russian's forced it down over Sakhalin Island. Nan? - John stayed back a day. Oh God. - Nan, he'll be alright. - Excuse me, pardon me. I've got to call Elizabeth. - Oh Nan. - Dammit, I can't find the paper Elizabeth wrote her number on. - Nan, sit down. I'll try and track down Elizabeth for you. - Oh God, let him be safe. Let them all be safe. - Nan, is there anything we can do? - John was on the plane. I'll take care of it. - Yes, may I speak with Elizabeth Moore please? When do you expect her back? Would you please have her call her mother right away? Thank you. Oh, I need to call the children. They didn't know that John was on that flight. They might release the names on the news. - Nan, we'll be right out here if you need us. - Nan, Nan, it was a commercial air liner. The Russians will just detain it. A week from now, it'll be nothing more than an embarrassing incident and John will have a terrific story to tell. - At 1400 hours Greenwich Mean Time yesterday, A Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 on route from New York to Seoul, Korea departed Anchorage, Alaska. The aircraft strayed into Soviet air space over the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Soviets tracked the commercial airliner for some two and one half hours. At 1821 hours, the Korean aircraft was reported by the Soviet pilot at 10,000 meters. At 1826 hours, the Soviet pilot reported that he fires a missile. And the target was destroyed. - What's he saying? - Nan. - Soviet Union. The United States reacts with revulsion to this attack. Loss of life appears to be heavy. We can see no ... - I thought it was safe. - For this appalling act. - It was on Sakhalin. That's what they told us. How can he be saying this? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - He's dead. - Oh Nan. Nan. - My son is dead. I want to pick up Elizabeth at the airport. - Come on Nan, she said she'd take a cab. She'll be fine. - An account of what happened? - Are you Mrs. Moore? Are you Mrs. Moore? Can we get a comment from you ma'am? - Would you just stand back from the car. Good Just stand back from the car. Just stand back. Stand back. - Have you heard anything? - Have you identified the body yet Mrs. Moore? - Can you give me a comment on the tragedy of your son? - Mrs. Moore, I know this is a difficult time for you right now, but people need to know what you're thinking and feeling about this incident. How do you feel toward the Soviets? - I'm sorry, Mrs. Moore is in no shape to answer any questions right now. Please. - Mrs. Moore, the world mourns with you Mrs. Moore. - The search flotilla of over 60 ships and aircraft remains on station in the sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan. The belief here is that the Soviet Union may have already ... - It's very hot. - The downed Korean airliner, or the jumbo jet's black box flight and voice recorders. - Let me turn that off. - No. - The 747 was shot down. Among the northern Hokkaido coastline, authorities continue to look for debris washed ashore. The first piece of identification of an American aboard the airliner was ... - John. - Oh honey, it must have happened so fast. - Meanwhile, the two week suspension of the Tokyo Moscow air services - Hello. No, she can't come to the phone right now. - Oh, why don't those reporters leave us along. How can I describe how I feel. - There are angry demonstrations here in Washington denouncing the Soviet Union. Do you think we should retaliate against the Russians? - The only thing I know that John would be strongly against is this notion of retaliation. Retaliation is just ridiculous. And to think in those terms would be to negate his life. - Momma? I'm going to go to Korea. Will you change your mind and come with me? - Oh, it's halfway across the world. I don't have the strength. - I'll try and bring him back. - It doesn't feel real, does it? When Ben had cancer, at least we all had the chance to accept what was happening, to say goodbye. This photo of John was taken before you were born. He was seven years old. He used to get out of school before Ben. That was when we put him in the special school. I used to fix a snack for us and then I'd pick him up and we'd go down to the park. That we were pals. - Is that why you used to call him pal? - He felt different from the other kids because of his reading problem, and because we had to change schools for him. But I didn't want him to feel different. I wanted him to feel special. - He was special. He worked so hard. Don't they watch momma? Don't they have radar? Don't they watch Russia? They must. - Who's they? - Our military. I don't know, Intelligence. It's a border, we must watch Russia all the time, don't we? - Well, one would think. - I mean, aren't there people just glued to the radar watching if Russia launches World War III? If they're looking for missiles all the time, don't you think that they would spot and airplane of course? - Well our government isn't going to let the Russians get away with this. We're gonna find out what happened. - I bet we never do. You work for the government, you never talk to us about work. Do you really think that we're ever gonna find out whatever happened up there? - Honey, what do you want me to do? I've lost my son. - He was my brother. I just lost my brother. Does any of this make sense to you? Any of it? - Let me help you. Let's go. - Memorial service was held in Seoul's main football stadium. It was packed to capacity. Buddhists, Catholic and Protestant rites were held. The victims of the jumbo jet disaster were of 16 different nationalities. Korean Air Lines arranged for nearly 100 family members of foreign passengers killed to be there. - She had to touch their names momma. She couldn't accept their death until she had touched their names. Momma? - I'm still here honey. I was so worried for you. - No, I'm alright. I'm gonna go to Hokkaido tomorrow. We've heard that some bodies have washed up on the shore there. I'm sorry momma. I don't know what other words to use. - You be strong for me Elizabeth. - I will momma. - Are you gonna be at the memorial service in Washington? - I'll try. I love you. The president is greeting the relatives downstairs mother. - Was John? - We didn't find anything. - Nothing? Not a trace? - There was some debris that washed up on the shores in Hokkaido. Parts of bodies were found. - Why couldn't they have all be safe like we were told? - Safe of Sakhalin was a lie mother. - We don't know that. - We learned in Hokkaido that the US had ships out looking for wreckage. - Elizabeth! - They were looking for wreckage hours before they told us that the plane was forced down and safe on Sakhalin. - We don't know that. Stop it. I don't have a body to bury. This is the second time I have been at a service for a son. When I lost Ben, it was an act of God. There was nothing or no one to blame for that. But John was murdered. And I have nothing to bury. How can I put that son to rest? - Those were the voices of the Soviet pilots. In this tape, the pilot who fired the missile describes his search for what he calls the target. He reports he has it in sight. Indeed, he pulls up within about a mile of the Korean plane. He then reports he's reducing speed to get behind the airliner. Gives his distance from the plane at various points in this maneuver and finally announces what can only be called the Korean Air Line Massacre. He says he has locked on the radar, which aims his missiles, has launched those missiles. The target has been destroyed and he is breaking off the attack. The 747 has a unique and distinctive silhouette unlike any other plane in the world. There is no way a pilot could mistake this for anything other that a civilian airliner. Our immediate challenge to this atrocity is to assure that we make the skies safer and that we seek just compensation for the families of those who were killed. Make no mistake about it, this attack was not just against ourselves or the Republic of Korea. This was the Soviet Union against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere. It was an act of barbarism. - No, turn it over. - Why don't you try to go back to work mother? - Mary, did you hear Schultz say that they listened in on the Soviet pilots, that they could hear them? - The more you dwell on it, the more it will hurt. - If they could hear them, wouldn't you think they'd know that there was something wrong? - Mother. Try to go back to work. Somehow we need to pull ourselves back together. Try. - Mother, you never told me that you like the job I did on half the garage. - Oh, but it was wonderful. You want to do the rest of the house? - You just want to get your hands on the grandchildren. - I have no shame. I can't wait. - I just want to make sure that you're taken care of. I'll miss you. - I love you pal. Lilian? I can't come in. I don't know. Maybe next week. I don't know. Lilian, I can't talk right now. - Need a hand? - Sure. Now, where were you an hour ago? Morning Ernie. - Morning Mrs. Moore. - Thank you. He passed the Bar. - Aren't you glad I talked you in to this? - It's a gorgeous exhibit. - Say thank you Lilian. - Thank you Lilian. This is the best part of Washington, the galleries, the museums and the galleries. When the kids were little, I used to pack them all up, all four of them, and we would go through the galleries. - Just keep moving. I'm not gonna pretend I know what you're feeling, but somehow you've got to go on. How can I help you? - I don't think anyone can who hasn't lost what I've lost. Hello? - I didn't wake you did I momma? - Oh, no, no. I was up. I was just picking out an outfit for work. I'm going to go to work tomorrow. - Good. Very good. - What do you need sweetheart? - Who says I need anything? - Habits. - Mother. - I'm sorry, sorry. Let's start over. How is your love life? No, don't tell me. - I wanted to let you know I'm sending you some articles from the Berkshire Eagle written by a guy named Robert Allardyce. - Oh, why? - Because he's investigated some plane crashes and he has some theories about what happened. - Elizabeth, honey I want you to look after yourself. - I loved him mother. - I know you did sweetheart. But you have your own future to be concerned about. Now you have school and this is your freshman year. - Mother, this man doesn't think the pilot strayed by accident. He thinks the course was set. - But, but that is insane. - The history of the world is, is shaped by somebody doing one insane thing or another, and guess who has to pay for it? People like John. - Oh honey, you don't know what you're saying. Stop it. - Momma, do you want to look the other way? Do you want to say John died and we don't know why, and we don't even care enough to find out what happened? Just read the articles. Okay momma? - Our little one's keeping her so busy she hasn't even had time to spend her rave. - It was so kind of you both to drop by during those first few weeks. Bruce, I don't mean to put you on the spot. - But you're going to anyway, huh? - There's been certain things I've read that I don't understand, like RC135s. - Now Nan, the people who really know about RC135s aren't likely to be talking to either one of us. - All these years in Intelligence and you, you still know nothing? - We could not break without secrets. It's called national security. - Oh Bruce please, it was right there in the New York Times. An RC135 flew near oh oh seven. - The Russians say an RC135 was in the area. - Was it? Alright. Can you at least tell me what an RC135 does? - An RC 135 is an Air Force reconnaissance plane. It makes routine flights along the Russian coast and eavesdrops on electronic communications. It's one of the main ways we keep tabs on the Russian military. And none of that's a secret. Not even to the Russians. - And that's it? - More or less. - Bruce, we all know that we're spying on each other. Thanks for enlightening me. - Nan. Let's go over here. It goes back to what we've been doing since the 50s. Sometimes we take these reconnaissance planes loaded with electronics gear. We send them right up to the border. We call it tickling. It's a game we play. - And this is in the name of defense? - It's called the Cold War Nan, and it works both ways. - The Russians said that they were confused. Now why would they have thought that an airliner was an Air Force spy plane? - The Russians are used to monitoring the reconnaissance planes on patrol, but they've never seen anything like this. Now two blips representing two planes, merged right on the Russian radar screen. - So they couldn't tell the difference between the RC137 and the airliner any more? - Exactly. And from that point on, the Russians claimed a plane, possibly an RC135 was headed straight toward the military base in Kamchatka. - Bruce, if there's anything that you know ... - Nan, the Russians have to come up with their version of things too. - Tickling, huh? - Whatever the reason, Flight oh oh seven was where it was. It triggered a military alert. - But these weren't soldiers on a reconnaissance plane, these were innocent people. - Nan, I don't know if the plane was sent in deliberately or not. But the Russian defense system lit up like a Christmas tree, and what we learned from it was valuable. - It was valuable? - I broke you mug while you were gone. I'm owning up to it. You can have mine. - Lilian, I'll cherish it. Thank you honey. - I'm glad you're back. Oh, you got a lot of paperwork. - Lilian, it flew over two Soviet military bases, and it had to fly through our buffer zone to get there. - Nan, don't do this to yourself. - It just keeps going around in my head. Somebody must have seen. I mean we watch our buffer zone for income missiles. - It's gonna take a long time to put all the pieces together. - Schultz said in his speech we knew the Soviet fighter was in constant contact with his ground control. We heard them. Now Lilian, somebody was listening. - Nan, the Soviet fighter pilot was speaking in Russian. Can you imagine the bureaucratic mess until they get a final translation? - Lilian, we live in a world where we can be blown up in minutes. Now I would like to believe that our defense system was a little more efficient than what you are suggesting. - Nan, nobody should have to ever go through what you're going through. Please, don't make it any worse on yourself. - Lady? Lady? Lady? - This guy Allardyce is out on a limb. How can a guy in Massachusetts claim to know what went on over the eastern seaboard of Russia. - He's a 747 flight engineer. He knows those planes well. - It doesn't tell you he's off his rocker. - I want to hear what he has to say. - It's clear what he has to say, he asks questions he can't answer. And then infers the US is at the bottom of it. Did the CIA have a hand in this bloody mess? Oh sweetheart, all I see in front of you is frustration and bitterness. You've got to pick up the pieces of your life. - If I want to hear something that makes sense... - There are a lot of respectable people in this country who believe the plane strayed. John is gone. Come to peace with that. - How? Can you tell me how? One day, I had a young boy. A strapping, sweet, brilliant young man with every prospect of a future, and now this is what I have. A picture of John's tennis shoes amid the debris. You see the white paint on them? That's the same paint that's on my garage door. Now this is what I'm left with. I want to know why. - I read Mr. Allardyce, that the pilot may have punched in the wrong coordinates and that's what set the plane on the wrong course. - Mistakes can be made, but it's not like hitting the number in your telephone. There are three computers that make up the inertial navigational system. The pilot must enter the same numbers into each one of them. The numbers must agree with each other. If they don't, lights flash and warning buzzers go off. - Well what if he puts the same wrong number into each system. - The pilot doesn't fly the plane alone. There's a flight engineer and a copilot. They are all responsible for loading in the system and they're constantly cross checking. - This sounds crazy, but, I mean what if all three believed that they were putting in the right numbers? - Well even the crew doesn't fly the plane alone. There is ground control and there are way points where the pilot must check his location and report it in. - You said that Captain Chun was used to flying this course. But what if the crew were bored, or inattentive? - I was in the cockpit of a 747 for seven years, some of them spent flying by Albania. We were issued navigational maps. And over Albania, where the words "Warning, aircraft infringing upon "non-free flying territory. "May be fired upon without warning". Now, Captain Chun had a navigational map and you'd better believe that over Russia, the same warning was issued. If a pilot is going to go to sleep with his feet up on the dash, it won't be during a checkpoint. - Let's say they did make a mistake in the beginning, and it just compounded along the way. - Even so, there are many ways to tell where you are by the checkpoints. If it wasn't their INS, their radar would have told them that there was a landmass where it was not supposed to be. - If they reported their position and they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, why wouldn't somebody on the ground tell them that they were off course? - Because the crew didn't report its actual location. They reported their position as if they were on course. - You're saying the crew lied? - That's what occurred to me. Yes. At first, I thought it might be an equipment failure. I mean when I go up in a plane, I depend on that equipment. I want to know where I'm going to come down. - But it wasn't the equipment? - No. When there is an investigation, we start with the crash and work it back all the way to the beginning of the flight to try to find out what failed, what went wrong to cause the accident. - And what about oh oh seven? - It just doesn't hold together. There is no logical way to explain how Chun got where he did by accident. - It's just so hard to believe. - Yes. And I am absolutely appalled by the possibilities. People put their faith in a commercial airline and that is a trust that simply can not be betrayed. - I mean who in their right mind would jeopardize innocent people? - There were 269 passengers whose families are probably asking the same questions you are. - I need a partner for bridge tonight. - Can't. - Well, you can't say I didn't ask. - Lilian, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. - Oh, it's okay. - This is a study of the incident by an international investigative team. It's called the ICAO Report. - And? - And they say it was an accident and that the pilot was inattentive. - Maybe he was. - Lilian, this report was rushed. It was done in less than three months. - Would it change the facts if it took three years? - Maybe. I mean I just don't understand. I mean even in their own report, these people say that they did not have access to all of the radar tapes. Now why would the government hold back radar tapes? - You're off on a bad track. You want to blame somebody. You can't accept that this just happened. A horrible accident. - Now this organization had only one crash investigation to it's credit. Now how can this be trusted? - Why don't you just yell at the top of your lungs that the government is lying. You have to trust the people in power that they know our interests better than we do. What choice do we have? - It was a good film Nan, trust me. - Did I snore? - You even whistled. - Oh stop. I'm just so tired. - Well, you've been butting heads with every bureaucrat in town, with Korean Airlines. If I were you, I'd be tired too. - I don't want to fight with them David. I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants a list of the relatives' names and addresses. - Honey, it's a matter of privacy. - The victims personal effects was a spread in Life Magazine. Faces twisted with grief. Elizabeth is in Newsweek. I mean there's nothing private about it. - You're gonna be at this for the rest of your life. - You know, the newspapers printed a list of the victims. Maybe that will be a place to start. - You've got to put your life back together again. Help me help you do that. - If only we could find each other, maybe, maybe we could look after each other. Maybe we could do something. - Do what? - I don't know. - Come to the cape with me. Change your mind. - Going away for the weekend with you isn't going to help anything. - Sorry if I'm taking time away from your dead son. - I'm sorry. Sorry. I have listened to the tape over and over and it is frightening. - The words were very difficult to hear mother. - You know Bob Allardyce heard it. He sent it to an acoustics expert and he agreed with Bob, that the last radio transmission from the plane was very, very strange. - Mom, why don't we go in and buy something pretty. - Oh, no, no, no, you go on. I'm gonna entertain the baby. It's alright darling. - Okay, well, he has some toys if he gets cranky. - Alright. We're gonna watch all the people. There we go. Excuse me, I don't suppose you remember me. My son was on the Korean Airliner. - Yes, I'm surprised you remembered me. There were so many of us out there at your home that day. - Well, I suppose it's all part of the job. There's a lot of new information that has come to light since then, and I hardly see anything about it on the television these days. - I think what we came to understand Mrs. ? - Moore. - Mrs. Moore is that it was a tragic set of circumstances. - Yes, yes of course. But that doesn't explain anything. - There really is no reason to keep reporting it. - There have been developments. I mean we were told things in the beginning that turned out to be quite untrue. - I just work for a local station. - Did you know that at first, the transcript of the Russian plane did not include a warning to the US Airliner? Now that was the version that the US presented in the United Nations. - Mrs. Moore, I'm really sorry, but I have to go. - Now there is a far more complete version of that same transcript. And everybody says that, that it's quite clear that the Russian pilot did warn the airliner by firing tracer bullets and by rocking his wings. - What difference would that make? - Well all the difference in the world. I mean if the pilot was warned, why didn't he land that airliner? Why didn't he comply? - I haven't the vaguest idea. - Maybe the pilot knew exactly where he was. Maybe he wasn't innocently lost. - What would be the point? - Well to trigger a military alert so that we could study the Soviet Defense maneuvers. - Who gave the orders? The military? The head of the CIA? The President? Who are you pointing the finger at? - I don't know. But you have got to keep reporting this. - Mrs. Moore, I won't report what I can't prove. - Yes, but the government has held back tapes and records. Why did they say that the plane was safe on Sakhalin? Don't you walk away from me young lady. You come back here. Listen to me. I lost my son. - Momma, the cab's on its way. Momma? - He wrote a story about his life. It was a long time ago. - When we come back from Korea, let me help you put his things away. - I'm afraid of forgetting him. - Oh momma. - Who was he? Why was he put here? Why do we think about these things when it's too late? - Excuse me, I'm sorry. I don't know if you remember me. My name is Elizabeth Moore, and I was here in Korea last year. - I'm sorry. Those first few days are still a blur to me. I'm Anna, Anna Nillson. - My mother and I, well we were hoping that the relatives can get together at the Shilha Hotel tomorrow. - We need to know each other, all of us. - My two children were on that plane. - Yes? - You're organizing a meeting tomorrow? - Yes we are. - For the relatives? Is that right? - What do you want? - Our parents died on that flight. - We need to be careful. We don't have the same freedom here that you enjoy in America. - We want to know what has been said in your magazines and your newspapers. Here has been kept very quite. - Well some people feel that the plane simply strayed. But we have been presented with a theory that says that it didn't. - Captain Chun had been chosen to be the personal pilot for the President of Korea. He was a heavily decorated military pilot. How could he get lost? - The plane was only one minute and 38 seconds from free air space. - He was probably counting on the Soviets not shooting at an airliner. - We have a tape that was released by the Japanese. It's the last transmission that was heard after oh oh seven was hit. Only one phrase was verified by the acoustics expert. But he was also able to tell us what was not on there. - Even in Chun was innocently lost, he still must have known something was horribly wrong. - And still, the crew never gave their position and never declared an emergency. Now, it goes very quickly. Listen. There's going to be a bloodbath. Real bad. - What if people came forward and said yes, we knew. Yes, they sent the plane. That would not bring my daughter back. That would not bring your father and stepmother back. If people fried in hell for this, it would not bring anyone back. - That's true. But I can't understand why the whole country isn't screaming for an explanation. - Because, they only remember that an airplane went down. They don't feel robbed the way we do. - Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you see my logic? - I just can't pretend it didn't happen. - Bernard, we have to be in charge here. We are the ones who makes something happen. - They went to school in the Philippines. I let them go alone this time. Peter was going to meet them. - Anna, you can't blame yourself for not being there. - Were they frightened? I was not there to hold them. - Has anyone not put their name or address on this list? - I haven't. - I'll be sure everyone gets copies. - I think that we should formalize the group by having Anna and Elizabeth be the chairpersons. I'm so glad that we found each other. - No one in the world knows how we feel but us. - Perhaps, as a group, we can find a way to accept what we cannot change. - Perhaps as a group, we can change what we cannot accept. - You're gonna be in the center of it. You're a spokesperson now. - You know, a year ago Elizabeth, I could barely get out of bed. Now I'm angry. I want to know the truth. - Are you scared? - Yes. - How did John get in his head that he could make a difference in China? Was it courage or craziness? - Maybe you need both. I'm gonna have to think about him if I get up to speak in front of people. - Do you think it's possible to be heard in all of this? - I think it's more possible here than anywhere. - I don't care what you say lady, the Russians blew one into some plane out of the sky. - Yes, you're right. I don't think anyone is saying there is any excuse for what the Russians did. - Well, you seem to feel that this may not have been an accident. - What I'm saying is that we don't know. I mean was it a coincidence that it flew over two of Russian's most sensitive military bases? - It was no coincidence. There are Russian bases all over that area. Come on lady, you can read a conspiracy theory into anything. If all this was something the CIA cooked up, don't you think by now the papers would have had a field day? - Okay. Also with us today is Captain Paul Billings, a commercial 747 pilot, 11 years experience in the cockpit. Captain, why do you think that the plane was so far off course? - Look, we're never going to know what happened in that airplane. But I can tell you one thing for sure, nobody flies into the Soviet Union on purpose. The Russians shoot down planes. We all know that. Even if you were on a spy mission, you wouldn't fly into Russia. It's suicide. - So, you don't think it was on a spy mission? - Personally, I find it very hard to believe. The government has refused to release classified information that could jeopardize American interests. No one disputes this. But, bureaucratic stonewalling does not exactly prove mass murder. - Okay. Next caller. You're on the air. - I'm with you Nan. I think people have short memories. This isn't the first time. - What do you mean? - 1978, a plane flew over a Russian military base also. - A commercial airline with innocent people aboard? - Yes. Like double oh seven, it was another Korean Airlines flight. It was shot at, but it was able to land. Two people died though. - What was the outcome? - The Russians detained the plane, but they finally let the people go. What was wild was the passengers knew they were headed in the wrong direction. When they looked out the window, the sun was on the wrong side of the cabin. - If the passengers realized this, what do you think was going on in the cockpit? - Well that's the question we need answered for oh oh seven. - Okay, that's about all the time we have. Thank you to Nan Moore, Captain Paul Billings. I'm Richard Edward Green. Talk Radio, next week, relationships in the 80s. Thank you very much. You were great. Okay, wrap. - You've been making some pretty strong statements. - Well it's part of our democracy to be able to ask for information. - Nan, you've got an ax to grind. You've been through a lot. - Lilian, tell me it hasn't crossed your mind. Don't you wonder if that plane wasn't wrong because someone got so excited at the prospect of tripping Soviet radar. Maybe it was planned. Did you know that there was another Korean airliner, KAL015 that was just 15 minutes behind oh oh seven? Now that pilot, Captain Park, spoke to oh oh seven. He even admits that he relayed some of oh oh seven's false position reports. - You idiot. It is only a matter of time til all of this catches up with you. Look around you. Who do you think you work for? - The government. The government that promises us freedom of speech and justice. Are we talking about the same government Lilian? - I have always admired you. I have watched you go through a divorce, get a job for the first time in your life, raise your children. I have seen you make it through things that would have crushed other people. Don't blow it now. You'll get through this. - I don't want to get through this Lilian. The price has been too high to just get through this. - I can't begin to fathom the pain and horror that you have personally experienced. - As the relatives of those who were lost ... - I know that you haven't gotten the information that would clear up the circumstances of this flight. And I know that this only prolongs your grief and anguish. - Congressman Overstar, we are here because an investigation would fall under the Transportation Committee, which you chair. - Yes, but emotions are high. I can understand your feelings about wanting an investigation. - Don't you think there should be a more extensive investigation, Congressman, after all 63 Americans died on this flight, including one of your colleagues, Congressman MacDonald? - My position is not all that different than yours. I have been asking questions too. I have been running into the same brick wall. - There are 1300 documents that have been held back by the State Department. We need to see them. And we need to subpoena all radar operators, all air traffic controllers ... - First, the horse, then the cart. See if I don't get more answers, I don't have the groundwork I need to, to push for a congressional investigation. - With due respect, is there any reason why you couldn't start a preliminary investigation where you could question the ground controllers in Anchorage, the FAA in Washington. And perhaps you would learn enough evidence that would support a formal investigation? - We never buried our dead. We never got any answers as to why they were flying where they were. They bought a ticket in New York. They were going to Seoul. And they ended up shot over Soviet air space. And no one has given us answers as to why when we said goodbye to our relatives in New York, they never came back to us. - It's money. See, it all comes down to money. We've had to tighten our belts because of the Gramm-Rudman Act. Now it's the end of the budget year. I don't have the funds to send a team of investigators to Anchorage or New York. - It costs 80 dollars to fly the shuttle from Washington to New York. - Well there's more to it than that. Now why don't we meet again in a couple of months. There will be a new budget then. - Just ridiculous. They spent 18 years in Washington, then all of a sudden, she announces they're selling their house. Poof, they're gone. - Well that's Foreign Service. You had to expect that one day he'd end up in some place foreign. - Raise your hand if you believe that he was in Foreign Service? - Let's behave. You don't expect him to go around calling himself an operative, do you? - Well whatever happened, we'll never know. - Probably not. Straight answers are hard to come by. - Well it is our town you know. Let's not bit the hand that feeds us. - Billions for defense. A hair trigger, and we still the audacity to goat each other. - Nan, please let it go for the evening. - Nan, the reality is it's tit for tat. It's the only way we know to prevent war. - We are at war. Don't you think we should wake up and understand that. - This is a party. Let's enjoy it. - Nan, it's hard to make sense out of something that was just bad luck. - Well I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that the plane that my son was on flew over two Russian military bases because of bad luck. - Nan, we're really very sorry. Very sorry. - When our children were growing up, I remember you held you little boy when he fell and he hurt his knee. We all did that for our children. We loved our children. - Nan, why don't you come inside and help me set up the coffee. - If we don't press for answers and accountability, how do you know that your son is safe, or your son, or your son? All you're gonna be left with is memories of holding your little boy while he cries into your shoulder. - Nan. - Nan. - Go back to the party. - You're pushing away your friend. Why? - They don't want to hear. - No they don't. I don't. Not 24 hours a day for over two years, enough. Nan. There's no place for me in your life anymore. - Anna, I'm so sorry to call so late, but I needed to talk. Anna, I have been so daffy. Well I made a fuss at a party and, it's all over with David and me. Uh huh. Anna, I don't want to alarm you but, we've got to be prepared. They're sending personal belongings to the relatives. They're sending us what's left. 400 dollars. - Who have you been calling? New York. San Francisco. Massachusetts? Mother. - Well I have to keep the relatives up on things. Sometimes we just need to talk. - Have you ever heard of a postage stamp? - When Ann Nillson tells me that she can't take a swim without thinking of her children in the Sea of Japan, she needs to hear a voice. - Mother, you have cut yourself off from your friends. I don't think you allow yourself to have any fun anymore. - Well, priorities change. - Mom. John embraced life. You gave him that. That's who you were. I can't stand to watch who you've become. I love you. I miss you. - Mary, you have a wonderful time ahead of you. Your little boy is going to develop and grow. You'll see him set off on his own and you're gonna be bursting with pride. And maybe then you'll understand my having to know why my son only lived for 28 years. - Nan, you must appreciate that not everyone is of the same thinking. - See, whether you like it or not Nan, Sy Hersh is a Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter. - That's the problem. His name brings credibility to his arguments and makes it feel as if there's nothing left to say. - I understand that. But Phil Donahue is not having us on his show so that we can agree with Sy Hersh's theory that the plane flew over Russia accidentally. - That's right. - What we all hold in common are questions. We see evidence that makes us want to know what happened. - Yes. But we have got to voice all of our doubts as strongly as we can, or we don't have a hope of prompting a congressional investigation. - In my heart, I think it is wrong to hold our government up to attack. It is wrong to say these beliefs are facts and use them to humiliate our government. - But we have facts that raise questions Bernard. And in our democratic society, our government has to answer to us. Our government is us. - I know better than you what this government is. You don't appreciate the country in which you live. You never had to live in another place, experience other leaders. - Yes, but Bernard even if our worst fears are realized, the fact that we were able to speak out, the fact that we were able to have an investigation that might uncover the truth makes me have even more faith in our system, have more belief in our country. - What has brought us together is grief. I hope that whatever it is you are looking for as a group will bring you peace. But, I cannot participate in this public outcry. - Bernard, it's more than two years, and we still don't have all the answers. It deserves a fight. - I do not want the memory of my daughter to be perpetuated by rage and distrust. I must find a different answer for myself. - There is a group of people who monitor the Soviet Union constantly. They're in the National Security Agency, the men who work for ... That's our hush hush secret agency. These people have, the NSA has stations all over the far east. In Alaska, in Hawaii, in Japan. They sit there and monitor the Russians continually. I've got to those people. I've talked to those people. That's one of the interesting parts of what I did, is I got them to tell me about how the administration manipulated the intelligence. None of them, and I've talked to 10 or 12 of those people, none of them had any advanced notice of a flight that day. And there's no way you're gonna send a spy plane in without having the people whose function it is to monitor Soviet radar be aware of it. And in fact, we sort of stumbled around a little bit. We really didn't know what was going on for four or five hours, and the first messages about a plane being lost were not filed to Washington by our NSA to the president until four or five hours later. I'm absolutely clear on that, that there was no advanced notice of a spy plane. All I can tell you, if it makes you happier, you can't rule anything. But I think really, the answer is that it wasn't a spy plane. If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck. It wasn't a spy plane. - You must share her, indignation at what appears to be the attitude that this is a historic event and it's over and we're moving on. - My indignation is really focused a little differently, but it's there too. I think our government has an obligation, the reason the government hasn't talked much about this is a little bit of an embarrassment over the fact that there was so much intelligence available, about the fact that it had not been identified before it was shot down. That's the reason obviously we have not given full scale debriefings on the issue to anybody who asks. Because it involves intelligence collection too, they will tell you, but the real reason is is because they manipulated the intelligence for political purposes. That's why you're not getting the information. I'm mad about that. I don't think a full scale investigation by a congressional committee, or by anybody into how the plane got off course, I don't know what it's gonna prove at this point. I don't, what are you gonna do? You can't talk to the pilot. - Nan's son, John was 27 when he died aboard this airliner. You wanted to add what? - Well, one thing I will say is that I've had people in Intelligence tell me that it was for electronic intelligence purposes. I've also had them say, "oh, they didn't think it would be shot down." now in order for you all to believe the thesis that he is pushing, you have to believe that the plane went over Petro Pavlov's base, turned, and came down over Sakhalin base accidentally. Now I find that very hard to believe. I mean, we also have to deal with certain items that we have that are factual. There's a tape that was made in the Anchorage air controller's tower and behind the air controller, the background noise is "we should warn them". That's what they said and they didn't warn them. Now why didn't they warn them? There were 25 children under 12 on that plane. - And we'll be back in just a moment. I'm not sure that I was as effective as I wanted to be. I was so nervous. - You did just fine, Nan. What you said and how you said it are going to make people care. - Bob, would you be a speaker on the panel after the memorial service? It'll be in New York this year. After the national exposure we got on Donahue, the press is paying more attention to us. - Nan, the relatives committee in Japan have pressured their government into releasing another radar tape. What I have to say is very unsettling. Nan, despite what Kasmin said, the radar data confirms that the plane continued to fly after it was hit by the missiles. Chun had control. It was a gradual descent. - Then they knew they were dying. They were in pain. Oh God. - Early in the flight, when it appeared that oh oh seven rendezvoused with the RC135, Chun lost eight minutes. - He lost eight minutes? - Remember, but, if we accept that Chun's job was to goad the Russians into revealing their channels of communications, then logically it had to be when the satellite would be in position to collect the information. There are observatories in England and Denmark that confirm. A US spy satellite was orbiting nearly overhead. Chun, well he had a schedule to keep. - And the passengers? - Chun pushed the plane to the limit. At those speeds, it would certainly not feel like ordinary turbulence. If Chun had held his course after he'd crossed Kamchatka, oh oh seven would have been safe. But he didn't. As he neared Sakhalin Island, he made an abrupt turn towards Soviet territory. Six minutes later, he turned westward, again positioning himself over a military base. The Soviet Air Defense was on high alert. But somehow a squadron from Kamchatka had been unable to find the plane. Another squadron took off from Sakhalin. One plane, and SU 15 piloted by Major Kasmin found oh oh seven. Later, the Russian pilot claimed he flashed his lights and rocked his wings and an internationally recognized warning. At this point, the copilot did a very odd thing. He called Tokyo ground control and reported a false altitude. And then, he asked for permission to climb to 35000 feet, but he only climbed to 32,000. The radio transmission was very muffled. And so are the ones that followed. It sounds like the copilot was wearing his oxygen mask. I think there's only one reason he would have been wearing an oxygen mask at this point. He knew he was in trouble. Kasmin says he fired four rounds of cannon bursts to warn oh oh seven. I believe these bursts of tracer fire were evident to Chun. Was Chun gambling that he could outfox the Russians? Suddenly oh oh seven slowed down. The Soviet plane almost overshot the airliner. If it had, Chun might have reached international airspace before Kasmin could regroup. But that's not what happened. Oh oh seven's fate was sealed. Computers in Kasmin's fighter took over. All he had to do was wait for the command. Military ground control on Sakhalin worked at a state of panic as they tried to reach their key decision makers in Moscow. If the plane escaped, there would be dire consequences for those responsible. Kasmin received his orders to fire. When the missile struck, oh oh seven was only a minute and 38 seconds away from international airspace. I wish the story ended there Nan. Kasmin said the target is destroyed, but he was wrong. What has been learned is that oh oh seven flew for an additional 11 and a half minutes. Fragments from the explosion probably tore into the fuselage. As Chun struggled to control the plane he knew that the cabin had suffered sudden decompression. But at that altitude, the air would have condensed into a fog. It had to be freezing at that altitude, and yet the plane was descending slowly. I figure Chun couldn't risk putting the plane under the stress of a rapid descent even though he knew people were suffocating. Shortly after the plane was hit, Chun was on the radio with Tokyo ground control. Captain Chun flew for at least 11 and a half minutes, never a call for mayday. He never gave his position. - That is Rachael. She was 17 when that picture was taken. - She was very beautiful. I didn't think I would have the opportunity to talk to you at the memorial service. - I'm not going to be there Nan. - Are you sure there's nothing that I can say that would change your mind? I heard about the scholarship that you've created in your daughter's name. - That is my answer. You see, I can live with it in that way. - For three years, I've been searching for the reasons why John died. - Three years. Isn't that an answer right there. - We lost our children Bernard. - How long will you continue? Until you are a bitter woman? Until you loose the capacity to love those who are still alive? - There was a spirit in John that I never really understood until he was gone. He felt that the individual could make a difference. And I won't turn my back on that. Have you ever wondered why they were put here? What was the purpose of their lives? - That is what is so tragic about loosing young people. All that is left of their legacy are the possibilities. Why did you come to see me? - John was going to China to teach. He wanted to exchange ideas with a different people. I think he felt as you did, that there was only one way to put an end to weapons, and mistrust. And that was by learning, by understanding. And when I heard about your scholarship, I knew that it also honored my son, and I wanted you to know this. - Perhaps there will come a day when there are no missiles, no fear, no war. And a plane flying over another country will always be seen to be a welcome thing. - I hope for that too Bernard. The families of American victims of the KALOO7 tragedy, a support group formed in 1983, held a memorial service today to commemorate the dead on the third anniversary of the disaster. We want a full federal investigation. It would be a dangerous precedent to allow this matter to simply fade into oblivion. There are many unanswered questions about the flight. And while nothing can ever mitigate our condemnation of the Soviet's inhuman act, these questions suggest that some responsibility for the tragedy may hit closer to home. There were 25 children on that plane. Your child could have been there. My son bought his ticket in the Village. Your children could have been on there.
