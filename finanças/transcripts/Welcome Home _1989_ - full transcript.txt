(helicopter) (woman shrieks) (man shouts) Agh ! Left! To your left! To your left! To your left! Right! Left! To your left! Company! To the rear... Turn! (drill sergeant hollering) Pick it up, people! You should know how to make all these moves in your sleep! To your left! Thomas, you just lay back and let old Dwayne do all the work. Hell, that's what old Dwayne gets paid for. (beeping) (irregular beeping) Mm-mm! Lunchtime! I bet you thought old Dwayne would never get here. Now, I hope you like this, cos I made it myself. But if it needs more salt or somethin ', just... ...sing out. You hear me, Thomas? Relax, Thomas. Come on, just relax. Wait a minute, Thomas. Wait a minute! Jake. What did you say? Talk to me, Thomas. Come on! Robbins... ...Jeremiah T . Jesus! Welcome back to planet Earth. Do you know where you are, son? Where's Leang ? Leang is who, son? - Where am I? - You're home. What's happened to Leang ? - Come on. It's okay. - Listen to me carefully, son. Right now we don't know where this Leang is... ...but we'll find out. Do you hear me? I gotta get outta here. You just rest now. You've been through quite an ordeal. Where are they? They're fine, son. We'll tell you all about them when you wake up. Everything is fine now. Nothing you heard gets out of this room. - You got that, Sergeant? - Yes, sir. This camp was in the Stung Treng ? I think they never moved me very far from where I went down. They kept saying they'd take me to Hanoi... ...if I'd sign a confession I'd been bombing Cambodian civilians... ...or some crap like that. And you never had contact with other Americans? No. They had me in a goddamn cage for four years. There was a lot of bombing. I don't know what was going on. I don't even know if I ever signed anything. When the camp was hit I got out. I think they were Khmer Rouge. I was hit... ...but I got through to the jungle. And that's all I know till Leang found me. And then? And then I just tried to stay alive. For 13 years? For 13 years. You know we have to do this, Lieutenant. Her people took me in. Hill people. And nobody went out. The ones who got in later said there was a blood bath when Pol Pot took over. You know Vietnam took Cambodia in '79? I heard. And I know we already had Kim. I had a wife and son, Colonel. And then Siv was born. I tried to get my fingerprints out with Leang's brother in '79. He actually made it into Thailand. They put him on a bus, drove him to the border... ...and forced him back into Cambodia through a fuckin' minefield. His wife made it home a year later. He didn't. Even if I'd had thoughts about trying to escape... ...I couldn't take a chance on what'd happen to my family if we got caught. According to your records... ...you were married to Sarah Renee Marsten ... ...May 1970 on your R&R in Hawaii... ...one month before you went down. Have you contacted her? Do you want us to? My family's over there, Colonel. I just want them out. I didn't play ball with the Vietnamese... ...if that's what you're trying to get at with this. The only thing we're trying to get at is the situation, Lieutenant... ...so it's best for everyone involved. I figure my ass is shit for telling you this... ...but I also figure you're getting one hell of a royal screw... ...and it doesn't help any that you're one dumb son of a bitch. Now, look. it isn't now, but when you came in... ...the name on your chart was Morgan. Thomas Morgan. I had a friend of mine look you up, Jeremiah T, and you know what? You are dead, my man. What the hell are you talking about? You been wondering why they got you stashed away out here in God's country? Jeremiah T Robbins bought it. Bagged and buried. Killed in action. June 12th, 1970. This whole thing is just fuckin' weird, man. It's just fuckin' weird. I wanna see my records. You were listed as Missing In Action 12 June, 1970. In 1973, after the peace accords... ...the Vietnamese released a set of remains and your personal effects... ...said to have been recovered from the crash site. Our lab confirmed the lD . You should also know that... ...Sarah Robbins remarried 12 years ago. I'm beginning to get the idea that my being alive... ...is not exactly a cause for celebration around here. There's a lot going on here that you aren't aware of, Robbins. And before this hits the 6 O'clock News, we all better know our positions. We've got almost 2,400 people still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. 82 of them in Cambodia... ...which is still a goddamn hot spot with the Vietnamese calling all the shots. Now they've exploited the MIA issue all the way down the line... ...trying to bring about a normalisation of relations with the US. Now... you... ...come waltzing out alive after 17 years. And every goddamn over-the-hill hippy and back-yard Rambo in the country... ...will be screaming to go over there and look for more. And the Vietnamese will have a fuckin ' field day. Colonel Barnes, with all due respect I'd like to request a discharge. Under the circumstances, that would be a little difficult. Of course, we'll settle your claim for back pay immediately... - I haven't made a claim. - ..If you cooperate. We need time to develop a policy position to deal with your reappearance. Something that won't jeopardise our current negotiations... Colonel... ...or the lives of other Americans who may be over there. You want me to keep quiet. We'd like to call the shots on this. What about my parents? Any objection if I decide to let 'em know I'm not dead? And your wife? She's in Thailand. You know what I mean, Robbins. I'm dead, remember? We consider this a matter of national security, Lieutenant. If you choose to contact your parents, it's imperative they understand that. You help me get my wife and children out of Thailand... ...and I'll cooperate as long as you want me to. Well, from what we've been able to determine... ...they were probably sent to one of the Thai holding camps at Site 2. Now they've got almost 200,000 people in there, but... ...if that's where they are, we'll find them. (knocking) Your new lD's in there. Consider yourself on condition to leave. You're not to leave the country under any circumstances... ...and you're to keep me informed of your whereabouts. ♪ No parade ♪ No marching band ♪ No banners catching the breeze ♪ No cheering crowd to warm your heart ♪ Welcome home ♪ Welcome home ♪ No hurrah's ♪ No tears of joy ♪ No ribbons round the trees ♪ Time has picked your pockets clean ♪ And time will take your welcome home ♪ Schoolyards ♪ Railroad tracks ♪ Memories laid end to end ♪ Seems only you have changed ♪ Welcome home ♪ Welcome home, my friend (board creaks) (doorbell) Can I help you?

Yeah. lt was a stroke or something like that. We never knew her. Thank you. Do you want to use the phone to see if he's still listed out there?

I got something inside if your head's hurtin '. No, I'm fine, Dad. You had enough to eat? I can make something else. No, that was plenty. You want a jacket? That feels good. I need to know about Sarah. Well, she's doing real well, Jake. Her husband's a good man. I think I'll walk a little. That's Tyler. He's almost 17 now. He's your boy, Jake. He's with Sarah and her husband in River Falls. I didn't know what was best. Still don't. - (meowing) - Oh, Tweetie ! Tweetie ! What are you doing? What are you doing? (starts engine) (stops engine) - I'll call you later. - Yeah. - See ya. - Yeah, okay. You said you'd buy one when you got back. God, Jake! (sighs) Jesus! I didn't want this to happen. I know. l ... l just can't think... I... I don't know... Maybe I did want it. I don't know what the hell I want. I thought if I could just look at him without him knowing it... And not screw your life up. I should never have come here. If he ever needs anything... Supper's ready. You go ahead. I almost didn't come home. Jake, you haven't done anything... ...to deserve this hurt you're putting yourself through. I know you're worried. Maybe I was wrong telling you about Tyler. You're right, you know. I didn't do anything. Not a goddamn thing. When the camp was hit I just ran. I got shot running. I was so scared, I didn't even know it. Son... I don't even remember getting anyplace. I woke up some place else. It was safe and I didn't do anything. There wasn't anything you could do, son. Are you listening to me? I had a woman who pulled me out of the jungle... ...and treated me like I was some kinda god. Two great kids. A goddamn hammock in my back yard. Do you think I was deprived over there? We had everything we needed. Life was swell. Couldn't have been more swell if we were sitting in fuckin' Syracuse! Every once in a while... ...I had a dream of what it was like back here. It was the only way I could even remember what you looked like. (man) I just can't believe Mel. Two weeks late, then showing up with a load of rosewood so warped... ...you couldn't get a toothpick for a pygmy out of it! Are you sure you won't come with us this weekend? You're the only one who ever catches anything. Um... I've got a food drive at school next week. A lot of calls to make. You're not hungry? I think I'll stay home, too. I'm going to study for a test on Monday. Well, hell! What? Well, I'm not going by myself. You're not going? I tell you what. We'll all go. What do you say? I'll do the cooking. You guys can do your stuff and I'll take charge of the kitchen. - Can I have the keys to the car? - You've got school tomorrow. - Forget it. I'll take my bike. - Where? Tyler! I didn't say you couldn't have it. Just don't be too late, okay? Thanks, Dad. Is he okay? Tyler? Yes, Tyler. The person who was sitting across the table from us. Our son. I think so. You know what I did during my service. I was a dentist's assistant in Louisiana for the whole goddamn war. Dad... I missed out on all the fightin '. When you came home with your orders, I was so goddamn proud... ...cos I believed the movies and the politicians... ...and the war stories at the Rotary Club. Now I had my boy, the flyer, to talk about. Cos, God knows, Mom and apple pie don't mean a damn thing... ...unless you got a boy in uniform fighting for 'em, huh? Until we got that box with the flag on it. And all of a sudden I didn't give a damn about any of that stuff any more. We just wanted our son back, not a goddamn box. Right then I knew, instead of being so proud of you in that John Wayne suit... ...I should have tied you up and driven you to Canada... ...or the goddamn North Pole if I had to! I had no idea about whether that war was right or wrong. All I knew was that they were telling me you were dead! And that was wrong! And I couldn't even try to believe in what you died for. It was like... lt was like me declaring personally... ...that you died for nothing. Not just some soldier some place, but my son! So don't think you've got a corner on the guilt market. You're alive, Jake! That's what's right! And, unless you can accept that and start feeling alive... ...then it's the same as being dead. You might just as well be in that box next to your mother. And then I'd have done all this goddamn soul-searching for nothing! Jesus, Jake! I'm sorry. This whole thing... What, son? ...is getting pretty fuckin' weird! You son of a bitch! You were willing to let me die in vain? You were swinging in a goddamn hammock? Drinking mango-ade . (laughing) (car draws up) (whispers) Tyler! Are you all right? I'm fine. Do you know the time? Sorry. Okay? Tyler! Well, I'm glad you decided to get up. Listen, I was, uh... thinking about fixing up the attic for Kim and Siv . It just needs some insulation. You used to like it up there in the summer. I don't wanna put you out. Hell, I'm not thinking about being put out. There's plenty of room. School bus goes right by the highway up there. I just thought maybe Leang would need a little time to get herself adjusted. Until you find something else. Just a thought. Okay. Okay? Sure. Thanks. I gotta introduce you to PAC-Man. (thunder) I knocked. The door was unlocked. I wanted... I thought I could talk to Harry. He's gone into town. Probably a couple of hours. It still fits. I should have called first. Sarah... Why did you have to come back? Do you have any idea what I went through those first years? Not knowing if you were alive, if I'd see you again. It was almost a relief when they told me you were dead. At least I could get on with it, for our son's sake. But I made one mistake. I promised myself I would never stop loving you. And I didn't. That's the joke. I never stopped. I made a stupid, safe, romantic promise to a dead man. But you aren't dead any more. Do you think I ever could have hurt you like this on purpose? That I had any control over what was happening to me? After a while... ...all this... Everything back here seemed like it was... something from another lifetime. Something I'd dreamed. Sarah, don't go. Phew! Ooh! That's one helluva day out there! You got caught too, huh? Yeah. Phew! Oh! How you doin ', sweetheart? You're a little bit flushed. Did you catch a cold out in all that? No, I'm fine. Just sitting too close to the fire, maybe. You want some coffee, Dad? I was going to make a pot. No. Well... ...I got all the drywall under a tarp in the truck. You get the fiberglass in? Just about. These are pretty much dry. This kinda reminds me of the night... ...your mother and I came home a little early from bingo. Dad... That was a helluva long time ago. You're not kids any more. I guess you know that. Is there a reason why the DIA would have been interested in you in '79? Defense intelligence? You remember that friend of mine? The one who looked you up for me? Well, he did a little more looking on his own, Jake. He thought I might be interested in an item he came up with. A State Department report of a possible live sighting... ...referred to the DIA for investigation. That was in '79. Well, the rest is locked up so tight he can't get at it. That mean anything to you? No. If this thing's so spooky... ...would they have just let me drive off into the sunset? They didn't know what the fuck to do. You seem to be giving them the answers. You are one paranoid son of a bitch! Well, fuckin ' A, man! There's other ways, Jake. There are other people involved. And maybe a helluva lot of other people! What makes you so sure you're the Lone Ranger? How do you know there aren't other guys over there they know about? And nobody's doing anything. Is that it? What the hell can they do? They gonna start another war with the Vietnamese? With the Russians sitting on the fuckin' bases that we built? We'd have to pay 'em off. And admit to a helluva lot of things nobody's willing to admit. You don't think they'd be tempted to cover it up... ...if they knew for sure there were other guys over there? Wake up and smell the shit, Rip. (Tyler) Ready! Set! Hike! (whistle) All right. Try it again! Come on, Robbins! Come on, move it! S-U-C-C-E-S-S! That's the way we spell success! Success! Uh! Uh! Success! Go, you mother! Ready! Set! Forward! (whistle) (whistle) What the hell's going on! Robbins! Are you nuts! Colonel Barnes? Have you found them? Tell me. Jake... ...Leang ... She's dead. Two weeks ago, the Vietnamese shelled the border camp. 11 people were killed. Leang ? Kim? And Siv ? They weren't listed among the casualties. The camp's been evacuated. One of the relief agencies picked up the unaccompanied minors. - Do you know where they are? - We're working on it. - You're working on it? - lt's just a matter of time. You were working on getting Leang out! Christ! We're sure they're safe. I wanna go over there. - That's not possible. - I don't give a damn! I want a passport and I wanna go over there. It wouldn't do any good. We're doing all we can. Just get the fuck outta here, Barnes! Your goddamn deal is off! I don't know what deal you're talking about, Lieutenant. You son of a bitch! I think you should know there's been some talk of an inquiry. A Marine came out of Vietnam in '79. He was court-martialled on charges of collaboration with the enemy. I didn't collaborate. I know that. I want my children safe. We're doing everything possible. The situation's very confused. Did you hear what I said? I want my kids here! Don't do anything to make it worse, Jake. Just trust me on this. Let us handle it. (footsteps) Sorry I'm late. Tyler... Where have you been? Out. Do you have some kind of problem we need to talk about? Tyler, look at me. He's been drinking. Let it go till the morning. I don't know what the hell's going on. Is he all right? I'm pretty sure he'll be worse in the morning. Let me see if he's okay. Get some sleep. I gotta go in early. You get to wake him up for school. - Woody... - Mm? Nothing. Tyler, come on. Wake up. You're going to be late for school. - Here. Drink this. - Just leave me alone. Don't talk to me like that! - Look, I know you're sick... - Yeah, I'm sick! Leave me alone. I don't want to go to school. Well, you should have thought of that before. Here. Drink this. I swear it'll make you feel better. I don't want anything from you! For God's sake, what is wrong with you! What did I do?! I saw you with that guy. Nice Porsche. Honey... ...you don't understand. Does Dad understand? Oh, God, Tyler! It's not what you think. What am I supposed to think? That he's your long-lost cousin? Am I supposed to call him "Uncle"? He's your father. He came to see you. Just to see what you look like. To find out if you need anything. (train's whistle) Hey, Woody! You wanna tell that jerk of a shithead Harris to get off my back? I'm moving this crap as fast as I can. Whistle while you work, Willy! You know how to whistle, don't you? Just pucker up and kiss ass. He's a customer, boy! - What's wrong with you? - You kiss it! I'll drive this goddamn forklift up it! That's the spirit, Willy. - Not good? - I let him go in after lunch. I thought we might get off easy. He's been such a good kid. He still is. He was upset. About what? What's so big he has to get drunk and risk killing himself, or somebody else? (buzzer) I can't take any calls now, Cindy. He just came to see Tyler. Not even to talk to him. He wasn't trying to screw up our lives. - Has he? - Has he what? Has he screwed up our lives? He doesn't know Tyler saw us. He's still waiting for me to decide whether he should talk to him. Sarah. Has he screwed up our lives? He ought a be home by now. Look, Woody, I feel... He'll see your car. He'll come in if he wants to. Thanks. You don't think he's gone out again? It's a helluva lot we're asking him to deal with... out of the blue. Maybe it'd be better if I wrote him. I could explain things better. I don't wanna put him through this. (door opens) - Honey... - Let me go up. Can I talk to you? All I want is for you to go back to wherever you came from... ...and leave us alone. I'll do that, if that's what you want. That's all I want. Can I just talk to you first? Five minutes? I made a mistake coming here. I know that. I didn't mean for this to happen. When I found out about you... All those years I never knew about you... And what about Mom? You knew about her, right? Tyler, you don't understand. - There's no way... - Are you a deserter? A what? I asked somebody what would happen if a guy who was supposed to be dead... ...showed up from Vietnam after 17 years. He said that guy would either be a hero or a deserter. If you're a hero, I guess I ought a have seen you on TV, right? I'm not a deserter. I'm no hero, either. Tyler, look at me! There are things I can't talk about now. Fine! So just leave, then, okay? If you're feeling sorry for me, don't. I've got a father. The only one I want. I'm not trying to take Woody's place. You couldn't. All you can do is hurt him. And Mom! Tyler... You know what this is? Woody took me to the Vets' Memorial in Washington... ...so I could find your name there. Well, that's it. Right up there with 50,000 other dead guys. Now would you just get outta here? I'm sorry. Jake! Jake, wait! Don't leave it like this. I can't believe I've done this to you. It had to happen. Tyler had to know. I had to know. Did you? I had to know, Jake. Where are you going? I don't know. Senator Camden? I've gotta talk to you. My name's Jake Robbins. Lieutenant, Air Force. What can I do for you on my vacation, Lieutenant? I was shot down over Cambodia in June, 1970. I came out of Cambodia three months ago. I don't know what you hope to gain by this political grandstanding, Camden. Except another term in office, if you pull it off. I also don't know what you want from me. I have managed to arrange a diplomatic passport for Lieutenant Robbins. We assume you have the paperwork necessary... ...to allow his children to leave Thailand and enter the United States. That is what we want from you, Colonel Barnes. You realise if you go through with this... ...you may be returning to face charges of desertion? Colonel... ...let's say that in 1973 a body is misidentified. It's happened before. And Lieutenant Robbins here is listed as Killed In Action. Six years later, Defense intelligence... ...investigates a reported sighting, backed up by fingerprints... ...and determines that the Lieutenant is indeed alive. Now this could get a little embarrassing. But you can't get to him without risking an international incident... ...and he can't get out. So all you have to do to cover your ass is bury the evidence... ...and hope he stays put. But eight years later Jake pops up, and now we've got a major fuck-up... ...that has been compounded by cover-ups all the way down the line. I should remind you that an inquiry on collaboration charges is still pending. What you do at this point could greatly influence any decisions in that matter. Colonel, I don't care what your people try to do to me. I told you all I wanted was my family back. But I was wrong. I want something more. I want me back. And I want whoever that man is who's buried next to my mother... ...back with his family. They deserve to know he's been accounted for... ...not just missing in some goddamn bureaucratic limbo. Colonel... ...my committee has no way of knowing... ...that Lieutenant Robbins is an isolated case... ...that there may not be others whose whereabouts have been likewise known... ...but not acknowledged. We're not going to let go of this. You are making a very big mistake, Senator. This could reach a helluva lot further than you realise. What you're doing could cause a great deal of embarrassment. It would all be a great deal less embarrassing... ...if it involved only an old cover-up during a previous administration. Wouldn't you agree, Colonel? Unless necessitated by your lack of cooperation... ...or by his defense in a court-martial proceeding... ...I see no reason that Lieutenant Robbins would pursue allegations... ...of the more recent attempts to suppress this evidence. This is not my decision to make. We will be in the lounge tomorrow evening at 6 o'clock. There's a flight connecting for Bangkok, and a flight for Washington. Lieutenant Robbins and I will be on one of them by seven. ♪ "Your Song"by Elton John ♪ lt's a little bit funny ♪ This feeling inside ♪ I'm not one of those who can easily hide ♪ I don't have much money ♪ But, boy, if I did ♪ I'dbuya big house where we both could live ♪ if I was a sculptor ♪ But then again, no ♪ Ora man who makes potions in a travelling show ♪ lknow it's not much ♪ But it's the best l can do ♪ My giftis my song and this one's for you ♪ And you can tell everybody ♪ This is your song ♪ lt maybe quite simple ♪ But now that it's done ♪ l hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind ♪ That l put down in words ♪ How wonderful life is while you're in the world ♪ So excuse me forgetting ♪ But these things I do ♪ You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue ♪ Anyway, the thing is ♪ What l really mean...

Good luck, Jake. You're going to have to deal with this, Tyler. - I don't want to talk about it. - I know you don't want to. You want to feel sorry for yourself... ...and make sure that everyone else feels sorry for you, too. I was a kid. I know the MO. - Bullshit! - Bullshit?
