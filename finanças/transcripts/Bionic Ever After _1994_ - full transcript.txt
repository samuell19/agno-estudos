And therefore we commend his soul to the lord. Thank you all for coming. So sorry. I've been an OSI agent a long time but what happened on my last mission, I can't tell you about it. I'm trying to cope but I just can't. I just can't... I can't take anymore. I mean, um, look at me, I'm falling apart. All right, so what do you want of me? I want you to help. Are you sure this is what you want? I'm sure. I mean, I'm through. I've gotta get out. Okay. I realize I'm asking more than I should. I don't have anywhere else to turn. It's okay. It's okay. We will go through this together. I'll be there for you. All right? Okay. It's just, I'm gonna to need some time to think about this. Give me till tomorrow afternoon. Can you live with that? Okay. Okay. Thank you. See you tomorrow. So? Oh, Oscar, you startled me. Does she want out? Now, that is privileged information, you know that. - Jaime Sommers... - I'm her boss. And I'm her doctor. Sorry. Normally, I wouldn't ask, but I've got something cooking in the Middle East. You've always got something cooking. And I need her, it's imperative! It's always imperative. Presidential order. Oh, well, that sounds familiar. Jaime, I'm asking you as a friend. Jaime Sommers, Family Counseling. Can you hold a moment? Oscar, you're gonna have to find another cook. She needs a rest. That bad, eh? Whatever she saw on her last assignment, it's completely rattled her. You wouldn't care to fill in the blanks, would you? I'll pretend you didn't ask me that. Well, that makes two of you. She won't tell me anything either. Look, she needs time to heal, not another assignment. You're gonna have to find somebody else. Jaime, I... I'm her friend too, Oscar. You wouldn't care to come out of retirement for a quick, life-threatening trip to the Far East, would you? Not a chance, buddy. I'm getting married in three days, you know that. I can dream, can't I? Not in this office. All right. I'll give Kimberly some time off and I'll find myself another agent. Meanwhile... See you at the altar. Bye. Regarding patient, Kimberly Harmon... That's a good color. Yeah, let's go with that one. Hey, if you're gonna start something, you better be prepared to finish it. Oh. Oh! Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Is that a list in your pocket or are you just glad to see me? Well, let me see. Ah, I got hotel, restaurant, flowers, travel agent... - What am I missing? -Minister. He wants to make sure we haven't changed our minds. - You're kidding? - No it's the way he works. We haven't, have we? No. Oh, good. Are you still happy about this? About standing up in front of 76 people, I don't know... You know what I mean. I do. How about you? I do, too. See, this was good! We can do this. Felt good. What would you say to some exercise? What did you have in mind? Well, I, uh... You know, according to my calculations, give or take a dollar or two, I think I owe you, somewhere in the neighborhood of six million dollars. My kind of neighborhood. Can't believe you keep coming back for more of this. Hmm, ready to visit the cleaners, darling? Come on. Hey, you all ready, sweetheart? Come on. Good shot. Very funny. All right, then. Got you with that one. Wow! - A-ha! A little slow on that one, huh? - Yeah. Okay, seven serving thirteen. Oh! Hey, I finally won. Hey, I won. Yeah. Whew, I can't believe I beat you. I should have changed the bet. To what? Oh, a quiet little ceremony on the beach, like, burgers for 10? You all right? Wounded pride, let's go. Morning. How closely will OSI monitor this situation? Very. I don't mind telling you, I'm worried. Don't be, I've got a team standing by if we need it. We're covered. - Oscar. - Carolyn. Hello. More beautiful every time I see you. You will stay for the ball tomorrow, won't you? The fairest lady is already spoken for. Regrets. Oh, Oscar, honestly, the way you come and go, you haven't changed a bit. I've got a good excuse, this time. I'm the best man at a wedding. Steve Austin. About time. Well, that is a good excuse. Come on, Oscar, I'll walk you to the car. You have a visitor I see, Mr. Ambassador. I don't know what else to say, Mac. - I just hope your intelligence... - Relax - Rashid. - Ah, Mr.Ambassador Who's that? Tennis star, Astaad Rashid. Our guest of honor. He has all the female population smitten, but he skulks around here like a church mouse. Boy needs a good talking to, if you ask me. Thanks for coming, Oscar. I'm grateful. - Give my best to Steve. - I shall. So long, Mac. Oh, yes. A thing of beauty. What hazardous mission? Come on, that Russian spy defected. Or, how about rescuing that mad scientist from Kaifra. - Oh, God. - Now that was bad. Yes, I remember. It was also the time that you insisted we go north to Garaa Telbout. Well, it was you who insisted that we go south. That's right. So, we went east. Oh, well. You know, none of it can compare to my most dangerous mission, though. What? Asking you to marry me. Oh, right. Uh, who did the asking? Well, I do recall a little assistance. A little assistance? Hmm, well... I better get the check. Uh, waiter! I know that look. What look? I know that tone too. Well, I was just thinking. You know, marrying you looks as good today as it did 20 years ago. But I just... I just think we ought to postpone the wedding a little bit. - Is that right? - Yeah. Why? Well, Dr. March and is going on vacation. He's referred all his patients to me and I'm gonna be swamped. Some of those patients are very fragile people. Well, add me to the list. Honey, I want our wedding day to be wonderful. I don't wanna be thinking about anything or anyone else. So, we wait. For what? The day that Jaime Sommers stops caring about her patients? The day that her professional career doesn't step on her private life? That sounds like a very long wait. Please don't fight me on this. No, no, no, no, no. Look, I'm sorry, but you're a part of my life. I'll share you with your patients if I have to. They can come to the wedding for all I care but we're getting married in two days, if we have to perform the ceremony right in your office. Jaime... I was just, sort of, hoping you'd understand. Look, I'm scared too. We just have to have a little faith. A little stubbornness? Well, I used to be tenacious, but I'm mellowing. - What's the matter? - Uh, it's my hand I-- I think it's embarrassed about losing the game yesterday. Let me see. You told anybody about this? There's nothing to tell, it's just a little pain. I think it's probably just stress. How's that? It's better. Wow... Call it biopractics. biopractics? Let me see. Oh! Oh! I'm sorry... It was an accident, I swear. You feel better now? I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm really... Oh! You! Hello? Let me guess, you're working? Well, now you know what you're in for, marrying me. Yeah, well, I'll take my chances. I just want you to promise me you'll talk to Oscar about your hand. I will. If it gets any worse, I promise. I worry about you. And I love you too. Now, good night. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. What is happening to me? Yeah, Oscar Goldman. Mmm. So much for working into the night. Oh, my God! Well, it seems that we're on time... Marine, listen up! XO wants you both back at HQ, double time. Don't ask. I don't get paid to think. XO pointed, said march, here we are. Bing, bang, boom. Yes, gunning. - One of the few. - One of the proud. Sorry, folks, party's been canceled. - Very nice wine, very nice party. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Yes, it is. - You're a very beautiful girl. - Thank you. - Señor, nice to see you. - Mr. Ambassador. - Nice to see you. - Wonderful to be here. - Excuse me. - Sure. Carolyn and I are so happy you were able be here. - Ah, Mr. Ambassador. -Ah, Mr. Rashid. Are you enjoying yourself? Yes, very much, thank you. However, I wish to speak to you on a matter of great importance. Really? Yes. I have decided to request political asylum of you, sir. Yes, absolutely right. I wish to become an American. John, there are men running through the garden. What? They have guns. Oh, my God. Oscar was wrong. We're going to my office. Quick, let's get inside. Good afternoon, Mr. Ambassador. No. Thanks for trying, operator. So, what did you tell Steve? I told him my already burdensome caseload had become overwhelming. Not any easy man to bluff. This is true. Oscar, my, uh, my legs are weak. My arm has been aching for a month, it's having spasms and the... This morning I couldn't even lift it up over my shoulder. And my ear, I keep hearing conversations everywhere I go. I'm at work, I'm in the grocery store and all the sounds, they keep running together and... I'm having trouble isolating anything. My bionics are breaking down. Well, well, that's not possible. Oscar, it's my body. I'm telling you, I can't control it. Well, I'll track down Rudy Wells. I'm sure he can explain it to us. What if he can't? What if I end up in a wheelchair? - You won't. - What if I do? Steve is expecting to marry somebody who beats his behind in racquetball. Somebody who, who runs 60 miles an hour, takes a little 20-mile swim with him once a week. We've been bionic together for a very long time. Jaime... Steve has loved you through so much. He's not gonna stop now. Well, I can't ignore the truth. Look, I'm becoming somebody, neither one of us knows. And, yes, I know he'll do what he'll do. He'll stay and he'll be wonderful, but can't dump myself on him in that condition. I can't put us through that. I can't stand the thought of him loving me out of pity or having him look at me - Stop it! Just stop it! - and now knowing what he's feeling. Steve loves you. Oscar... Excuse me. What is it, Jim? Opsinc message from NSA. Well, read it. What do they say? It's all right, go ahead, read it. "Satellite reports gunfire at American Embassy, Nassau. "Reports from local authorities to follow." End message. 1621 hours. Call Hellstrom at the CIA. Go on. Put out your fire, it's okay. - I'm alright. - Alright, then. I'll track Rudy down, huh? Thank you. - Sure you're all right? - Fine. - Okay. - Yeah. Now that I have your undivided attention... Just tell us what you want. One of your guests. Who? One Astaad Rashid. The local constabulary, how nice. Okay, I want strength and disposition numbers. Yes, Mr. Goldman. I wanna talk to the Police Commissioner, and if he's off the island, tell him to call me as soon as you can find him. Right away, sir. And it now seems that the American Embassy... That's Nassau, isn't it? The American Embassy is under some kind of an attack. Details remain sketchy, but sources now confirm the initial reports that local police responded to gunfire on the embassy grounds. These scenes were taped earlier, as police began to quickly cordon off the area, barring further access to our television news cameras. We believe their leader could be a man called Miles Kendrick. Kendrick? Kendrick, I know him. He was a company man. Bailed out after Afghanistan. - Went independent. - Well, don't stop. Go on. Well, he blew up a munitions factory in Tangier about four years ago that had been supplying Qaddafi. Our side was very happy about that till we realized he took all the armaments for himself and dynamited an empty building. In two seconds, you told me more than anybody else in this building has. Well, if he's your man, you've got your hands full. Wonderful. Well, I, uh, guess I'd better get out of your hair. Steve, I don't mean to be rude, but what are you doing here? Aren't you getting married in 48 hours? Well, I was looking for my bride. I found her secretary. She said she might be here. She was. Jaime wants to talk with you. She does? Oh, um, good. Sources have confirmed that there's been no contact thus far with anyone inside, where a reception was being held by American Ambassador John MacNamara for international tennis star Astaad Rashid... You know, John MacNamara saved my life once. ...winner of this year's singles tournament at Wimbledon. This is Simon Stepford for World News Network. Back to you, Faye, in the newsroom. Thank you, Simon. We will, of course, bring you the latest... I gotta go. That is commonly called a Scud. Maybe you've heard of it. Very low-tech, but effective. No one, I'm afraid, will be coming to your rescue as long as that is pointed out there. And we won't be going anywhere until we get Mr. Rashid. Understood? All this for a pretty tennis player? Why? Mr. Rashid is a traitor and a spy and I am being paid an obscene amount of money to bring him to justice. So, as you can see, it's really time to talk. Where is he? How did you do it? I mean, you were an operative for years and you survived with your sanity. Well, mostly. I had a lot of help. Your fiancé. Yes, and my family. I don't have anything like that. I never really did. Do you have friends? You have me now. You know, you seldom get help until you reach out for it. Yeah, I know. Doctor. I'll be right back. Oh! Dr. Sommers, are you okay? What's the matter with you? Are you in pain? Where does it hurt? Everywhere. Doctor? Doctor? Are you okay? Are you all right? Excuse me. I was looking for Jamie. Is she here? - One moment. - I'm going for help. Quick! Something's wrong. Jaime! Jaime! Jaime, what's the matter? What's wrong? Steve. I'm here, sweetheart, I'm here. It's killing me. What is? I'm dying. I'm dying. Dr. Reznik, please call the nurse's station. Dr. Reznik, please call the nurse's station. Nurse Peterson, please answer your page. Nurse Peterson, please answer your page. Steve. How is she, Rudy? I really don't have much to tell you, but, uh... Is she gonna live? Yeah. But she may not be the same Jaime when she wakes up. There may have been some neurological damage. I have someone flying down to consult with me. I'll know more then. Oscar. You okay? I was just explaining Jaime's condition. You see, if I'm right, Jaime may never be bionic again. Just keep her alive, Doc. Of course, that's the important thing. I just wanted to prepare you. And I'm saying you don't need to. All I want is Jaime back. Any way I can have her. Okay? Okay. Rudy, I'm glad you're here. So am I. What happened? I don't know. It's my life's work and I haven't a clue. But thus far, the unknown captors inside the embassy have not made any of their demands known, leaving the hostage negotiators little to do but sit and wait. ...situation that the American Embassy here in Nassau, clearly, cannot be allowed to continue. How you holding up? went on local television an hour ago to implore... Sounds like the world's going to hell in a hand basket. Yeah. I made all the calls. Everybody understands. The wedding guests. Thanks. And the, uh, hotel called. Yeah, I know. I'll take care of it. I can't stay. I understand. Thanks for coming. Right in here. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Now we go live to Nassau. The siege on the American Embassy here in Nassau continues with little change and with the missile still pointed at the heart of the city. Authorities here seem powerless to effect a solution in this tiny island paradise. We understand there's been no word sent from the negotiators to the President as yet but a high-level meeting has taken place tonight at the White House that the Joint Chiefs of Staff attended. ...reporting live, World News Network. And now back to you, Faye, at the News Desk. So, when was this sent? According to the postmark, yesterday. Yesterday? She must have taped it before she collapsed. Okay, go ahead. Play it. I have tried to tell you how I feel, Oscar, and I realize it's difficult to comprehend but it's as though my, my body is turning against me and it's trying to kill me. It's just the most awful thing I've ever experienced. And it's, uh, forced me to make the most difficult decision of my life. I have to call off the marriage because even if I do survive whatever this is that's happening to me, I don't expect to ever be the same again. Steve, you and I had what most people only dream about. My life was truly blessed with you and, uh, I will always love you. Please believe that what I'm doing, is the best for both of us. Jaime. - You're gonna be fine. - Go. Rudy Wells is doing everything he can. Just go. Please, Colonel Austin. So, what did you tell him? I told him I'd been in this hospital... To us. And we've been through a lot together. Steve. Ah, just let me finish, Jaime. When two people... Look, why don't we get married... Uh, just let me... What? Wouldn't you like to get married? Feel like some company? Sure. Well, now that I'm here, I don't know where to begin. Well, maybe I can help you. - You know I saw the video, right? - Yep. You gotta admit, she does have a flair for the dramatic. You know, I've been thinking... I've been thinking about what's been keeping me alive all these years. All the assignments that you sent me on where I should've come back in a body bag. It's that little something in my gut. Little somethin' I listen to that says, "Trust here, don't there, do this, don't do that." Well, it's talking to me right now, loud and clear, standing up and slapping me right in the face. And what is it saying? Look, it's saying, "Get the hell out of Dodge." Excuse me? Look, it's saying Jaime loves me. She doesn't want me out of her life. She'll realize that soon enough for herself. But in the meantime, I just can't sit here and not be with her. I gotta keep occupied, I gotta work. Go fishing. I want an assignment. Steve, let's not get rash. Oscar, please. It's been a long time. You know, you once said I was the best. Well obviously, you've already made up your mind. I wanna go to Nassau. Bartender! Yes, sir? I think I need a drink. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... Screw it. Waste them. Now you go clean up that mess. Hello. What are you doing here? Oscar sent me. You're OSI? That's right. I'm the other member of your team. Look, I'm sure you're very capable but, uh... Quote, "If he gives you any guff, "tell him he's off the case." Unquote. Sorry, he thought you might have an opinion. Like I said, welcome aboard. We've counted Kendrick's strength at ten men. They look more like light infantry. Machine pistols, body armor, night glasses. They have 34 prisoners in the embassy's wine cellar. No easy in, no easy out. I know, I've seen it. These hostages are not your local tourist riff Raff. Prime minister, the French Ambassador, Astaad Rashid, Princess Anne was a no-show. What about the missile? Chinese-made Scud. Point and shoot. It doesn't have to be accurate. I wouldn't wanna be within five blocks of where that lands. Actually, where it lands won't make a difference at all. What do you mean? Satellite infrared picked up a hot core. You're kidding? Nope, it's nuclear. Doesn't matter where it lands. A mile out at sea? Goodbye, Bahamas. Needless to say, just about nobody else knows that fact. They feel it might harm the tourist trade. You know, come to Nassau, get a tan? Sorry. Our Mr. Kendrick must really be hacked-off about something. Yeah, but what? That's the question. No, that's not the question. It isn't? The question is how does he hope to get out of there with the whole world camped on his doorstep? He's gotta have something up his sleeve. But if he can get out, I can get in. We can get in. Yeah, right. We. There's gotta be a way. Out of sight, out of mind. It's not them I'm worried about. You shouldn't be worried about anything. You haven't looked outside lately. Let them come. The more the merrier. We want every Tom, Dick and Harry with a tin badge and a cowboy ego from here to Timbuktu out there when we leave. Look, our little tennis player will be starving soon. He'll come out to eat. We'll take him and then we leave and your only problem will be what to do with two million dollars of your very own. What if he's gotten away? It would have been all over the news. No, he's here. We just haven't found him yet. If you say so. I do. Now go help Paul with the search. Rashid, where the hell are you? The continuing drama at the American Embassy in Nassau may have taken a turn for the worse late last night. Reports of an aborted rescue attempt by a contingent of local militia has just surfaced, indicating that they sustained numerous casualties. There's been no mention, however, of the condition of the hostages still believed to be held inside the embassy. I'll tell you what, Jim. Call State, maybe they know something. It's a virus. What's up, Rudy? I found Jaime's problem. It's a computer virus. So what are you saying? I'm saying that your body is fine. Your bionics are fine. What you have is a circuitry sickness. In a way, it's the same kind of sickness that a computer in your office would have. A data virus. Something's telling your brain, telling your circuits, that you're sick. In reality, there's nothing wrong with you. How did I get this? That's a different matter. If someone put a tainted disk in a computer, it would search out the data and contaminate it. The computer's fine but the data is gone. And Jamie has chips in her, just like a computer. You're saying someone did this to her? It's the only way. Someone went in and corrupted the circuitry. Probably in stages, over a period of time. That's impossible. Someone cut her open? It's the only way. Can you make her well? I think so. You think so? I've never seen this before, I've never done this before! I have to shut down your power source completely. And that should eliminate the virus. And then I replace the contaminated chips and I reprogram her. And that should work. You are a phenomenally complicated program. I'll do everything I can. Where's Steve? I can get word to him. Okay. Whoever did this to me, you know, they could be after him. I'm already on it. You just concentrate on getting well. Do you think he'll ever talk to me again? I don't think that's gonna be a problem. Oh, good. Okay, put her out. Prepare bio-chips for implantation. All right, shut down her power supply. Alright, this is the wine cellar here, staircase and hall leading to it. What's this? Trash collection. It's gathered here and then trucked out. It wouldn't work for us. The approach is too exposed. The service entrance? Same thing. I don't see a weakness. None. No old sewer entrances, underground conduit, abandoned tunnels. No discreet approaches, nothing. This guy Kendrick knew what he was doing when he picked this place for a siege. You've got multiple fields of fire here, here, here. He could settle in for the season for all we can do about it. But, how he gets out? Yeah, with ten men. You got me. I don't see it. Well, we will. Here's the work-up that you wanted. The guest list, staff. I don't see what good that's going to do us. Well, we haven't heard any demands. Now, he wants something. My guess is, whatever it is, it's got to be inside that embassy. How about some coffee? Hey, thanks. Can I ask you a personal question? Sure, why not? What... What was it like to work with someone you love? How did you know about that? I have low friends in high places? Come on, you two are the worst kept secret at OSI. That's a lot of water under the bridge since then. I'd still like to know. Well, I wouldn't recommend it. The job doesn't leave much time for anything else. That's why I got out. Why do you want to know? Just nosy. It's not every day you get to work with a living legend. Well, don't believe everything you hear. And half of what you see. Less, if you're smart. Mmm, good coffee. Thanks. Are you planning on getting married? Hardly. The ones I like don't like me. And the ones who like me are either, well, too young or too old or too something. It's just me and my mom. My dad passed away a while ago. I'm sorry. Well, I better get some sack time. That's a good idea. I'll wake you. Okay. That was good work today. Thanks. No, I mean it. I'm glad you're here. Thanks. I appreciate that. Steve? Steve. You know, you knew my father. You and Dr. Wells. Hi. - Hi. - How you feeling? Better. Good. You're going to be better than good. But I want you to take it easy for a while, because, there's some inner ear damage and you might have some balance problems for a while. But nothing to keep you from carrying on as normal. Once again I owe you my life. I don't know what to say. You're welcome. I made some improvements I think you'll like. - We'll talk later. - Okay I'll let you two catch up. I'll be in my office. Where's Steve? Have you talked to him? He's on an assignment. Where? I can't tell you that. Oh, Oscar, come on. You and I have to find out who did this to you. If you want to help Steve, that's the way to do it. ...John MacNamara, his wife Carolyn... John MacNamara? He's in The Bahamas? There's nothing you can do now. - Oscar. - He's in the Bahamas. I can't deal. Wait. Just a little dizzy. Just dizzy. Listen to me. You are going to get well. Stay here. Help me and do what Rudy says. Now do you understand? Oscar, the idea that he may have done this is so repulsive to me, I'm reluctant to even mention it. Well, I have to start somewhere, Rudy. All right. I had an associate once. A partner, really. And in a way, bionics is as much his as it is mine. And we had a falling out. He thought that I had betrayed him somehow. He was bitter, irrational, became hostile. You're talking about Jason Havilland? Yes. Dr. Jason Havilland. What do you know about Astaad Rashid? Uh, a little tennis, a lot of ladies, very good-looking. That's about it. Why? Well, his uncle traffics in arms. You're kidding. Oh, how does a tidbit like that stay off the 11:00 news? Well, his uncle is the man behind the man. Saddam most recently. And he's rich enough to stay that way. And do you think he figures into this somehow? Probably not. Like you say, just a tidbit. Are you all right? It's just my arm feels funny. I must have slept on it wrong. So, what is the plan? I'm working on it. Okay. Now what? Well, I want to check out a water tower. In broad daylight? I'm gonna try to make my way around to the back wall. There's more cover there. Not without me, you're not. Who's the boss here? You are. If I'm not back in two hours, contact Oscar, you got that? - Got it. - See ya. Up in the water tower. Come out or we'll shoot. Damn. Don't shoot. I give up, don't shoot. Climb down, now. The water tower, I swear, we checked it. Well, well, well. Astaad, I bring you greetings from your uncle. Please, I will pay you. Sorry. I already have a contract. Twenty million dollars. You must have been a very bad boy. Who was the one who said he checked the water tower? Well? Paul. Put him in the cellar. And then go find our eagle-eyed Paul and shoot him. What? Do it! I'd do it myself but I have more important matters! Radio the sub. Tell them to rendezvous at 0600 tomorrow. Now I believe I'll prepare our exit from here. Hello, is anyone there? Yeah, this is Captain Ramsey, who am I speaking to? Captain Ramsey, would you please tell your boss that I would like to speak with him. You can tell him, Trixie Winnetka is calling. Trixie Winnetka. Trixie Winnetka? That's what we said, Trixie Winnetka. We're dealing with a comedian here. I'm going to nail this guy. Put Trixie Winnetka through the skunk works. It may be code-speak, but I doubt it. Also, there's confirmation of wireless short-wave traffic both in and out of the embassy. Miles Kendrick has been talking to somebody, huh? - That's right. - And? It's untraceable. Hmm. - Jaime. - Hello. - Hello, Jim. - Hi. What are you doing out of bed? Doctor's orders. Follow all leads and I understand you have one. First Steve and now you? Well, it's a regular mutiny. What do you have? Something about Rudy's former partner. Feel like a car ride? As long as I'm not driving. So, you're the famous Oscar Goldman? My husband died four months ago. Oh. Our condolences. Somehow, I don't think you're here to comfort a bereaved widow. Are you? Well actually we're trying to find... No, absolutely not. You're correct. We had no idea. We are very sorry for your loss. Mrs. Havilland, your husband played a role in saving my life and the life of someone that I love very much. Oh, are you one of those people? Uh, yes. I see. Lucky you. Well, right now there is someone out there who is trying to destroy your husband's lifetime of work. Is that what this is about? Well, it stopped being my husband's work. A long time ago. It stopped being his life a long time ago. Cirrhosis of the liver. He drank himself to death. His work destroyed him. I don't think I can summon up much concern about it today. Mrs. Havilland, this is very important to us or we wouldn't be bothering you. Did your husband work for anybody else after he left the OSI? No. Or did he leave any papers with anyone or anything like that before he died? - No! - You're certain? Absolutely! I was there every single day! Do you know what it's like to watch someone you love slowly disappear? Well, your husband, he gave me something that I don't have any idea how I could ever possibly repay. But if you ever feel like you need to talk with someone, please, I'd be very happy if you called me. Truly. We should go. Thank you. Ah, excuse me? Could I ask who is this? My daughter. Your daughter? I don't see her very often. She works overseas. Did she know anything about your husband's work? Oh, yes, she's her father's daughter. I can't believe this, all this time I've been treating her. Boy is she good. You bet she's good. She's the agent I sent to the Bahamas with Steve. What are you talking about? She came in and volunteered. Oh, my God. Don't be complaining about that. Look at that. Miss, you can't park here. You'll have to move along. Well, can, can you make an exception? I'm attached with the American OSI. No exceptions. I have my orders to clear a five-block area around the embassy. Please, right now. Turn it around and go. You need to clear the streets. Keep the streets clear. Go back to your homes. Go home now. What's going on here? Well, well, well, the famous Steve Austin. Kendrick. Retirement not exciting enough for you? Or was it the call of your old Uncle Sam and the red, white and blue? It was something like that. Pity. I can guarantee you, you're not going to like this very much. It doesn't make sense. What's that? Your picture's going to be in every newspaper, post office and nickel and dime store from here to Hoboken. Am I that big? Oh, you're bigger. Well, thank God, I'm going nowhere near Hoboken then. Having all that money and being stuck in Hoboken. Imagine. Horrors! No. I have a little dacha on the Black Sea. Two hundred acres of the prettiest land rolling down to the jewel of the Volga. Do you have any idea how far twenty million American dollars goes on the Black Sea? I'm the czar returned. I'm the second coming. I'm King Miles I. Put him with the others. I have our exit to attend to. Who's that? Who's that? Steve? Steve Austin? Mac? Mac, is that you? What are you doing here? Same as you. No. Please. Tell me you're not alone. Tell me there are others coming. Maybe you better offer me a drink. Steve is in that compound. But that's all we know. This is all my fault. No, it isn't. He and John MacNamara are old friends, they go way back. It was Steve's choice. It was my video that nudged him into that choice. He was retired. You know that. Look, I know Steve too. He'll go a long way for a friend, especially a friend that saved his life. Get me to Nassau. Here it comes. No way. - I'm going, Oscar. - It's out of the question. Look, whether I'm on this team or not, I am going. I'm not gonna make another mistake. Look at it this way. It's your dream come true. Your prodigal children back in action. I suppose this serves me right. Get me General Hanks at Air Force. Atlantic flight com, this is Charlie-Eagle-Two. Climbing angel's three-five. Roger Charlie-two. Angel's three-five. Radar contact. Flight com, I am Bahamas bound, one passenger, ETA, 48 minutes. Roger, copy. You have a priority, PCA clearance, Charlie-Two. The sky is yours. Who the hell you flying, anyway? - None of your business. - Charlie-Two, out. Done. Let's see if that gets anyone's attention. How much did you plant? Enough to make them jumpy, not enough to hurt us. What the hell is that? We have a leak. Radiation detected in the nuclear warhead. I repeat, radiation detected, nuclear warhead. We have a leak. How you doing? I'm okay, Steve. Mac. Mmm? Mmm. What do they want, do you know? Rashid. But I haven't the foggiest idea why. It's not good though. The poor guy's been retching his guts out over there ever since they brought him in. It is my uncle. He thinks I have stole from him. But did you? I will pay you...five million dollars to bring me to safety. Ten million dollars! What's the drill here? Uh, food twice a day, thereabouts. infrequent visits. We don't scare them, so they've mostly forgotten about us. What about guards? Not recently. That's good. What do you have in mind? Trying to get us out of here. I'll second that motion. Remember, we have precious cargo. Valuable antiques. I resemble that remark. Was that your plan? Well, it used to work. You'd be surprised. What's that? That's funny. That's our old air raid alarm. What is it? Well, it was changed in the '60s, the Cuban missile crisis. It's got to be a mistake. It's a fallout alert. I was afraid you were gonna say that. Mom? Mom, please just listen to me. Mom, please, listen to me. I did something that... Put the phone down. Oh, God. Now. Don't even think about it. Don't worry. I won't run. You and I have got some talking to do. This wasn't about you Dr. Sommers, this was about my father Oscar Goldman. Oscar, it's Jaime. I'm here with Kimberly now. Jaime, we've just discovered short-wave radio equipment in Kimberly's apartment. We think that she is the one that's been communicating with Kendrick. She's the mole, you understand? Yes, I understand. I'm on my way. That your car out there? Yeah. Let's go. This is Ramsey reporting in at 0400. No change in the situation. No, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Stay in the car. Oh, and by the way, I don't think I'll have any trouble getting you out of the OSI. This is a restricted area. Whoa. That woman in the car, I want you to arrest and hold her. Well, shouldn't I get someone to... There's no time. Can you turn those off? - What, the lights? - Yeah. Um, yeah. I mean, with the proper authority. Just do it. Now. Yeah, this is Captain Ramsey. Get me tachcom. Oh, she's got an ID all right. Probably knows God himself. - Now, Captain... - Do it, kill the lights. Oh. Great. The lights! What are they up to? It doesn't matter anymore. Push their needles off the scale. Then round everyone up. We're getting out. Not bad, Rudy. Something's happening. Someone's coming down the stairs. They're coming to the door. - Steve. Steve! - Jaime! - Oh, God. - What are you doing here? Well, I could ask you the same thing. Coming out of retirement like this. Oh, I was so worried about you. Me, I wasn't the one dying in that hospital bed. Um. Excuse me? It's okay. She's my fiancé. Now what's that? I don't know. That's one I've never heard before. Yes, sir. Ten rads and climbing. We have an event, sir. Repeat, this is an event. You think we can go now? Yeah, I do. You do? I do. Let's go. Okay, folks, single file, single file. Very quiet. Are you okay, hon? You gonna make it? I'll be all right. Am I doing this right? You keep going, I'm gonna want a cigarette. - How is it? - It's better. Okay, look, I've got to tell you from experience, that this doesn't last very long so we better put a wiggle in our walk here. You go first. I love watching your wiggle. Let's go. I understand, sir. Yes, Mr. President. Right away. This is Oscar Goldman, send them in. Yes, sir. Got that. Go. Ready? Blow it! Split up! All right, you three men with me. Let's go. Tell the others. It's bingo time! Where are they? I don't know. So far so good. Look, why don't you get them out of here. I'll take care of Kendrick. - Wrong. - Wrong? You go with them, I'll find Kendrick. Will you please not argue with me? Don't raise your voice to me. Delta Teams 1 , 2 and 3 are moving into place. We're sending in the containment team now. You just got out of a hospital bed. I'm not the one who couldn't knock down a silly little door. I was just saving myself. Jaime, Steve, there are some kind of space men on the grounds. Oh, God. Radiation. Look, trust me. I want Kendrick. Honey, fine! Just be careful. I want you back. Me too. Now for a little smoke and mirrors. Yeah, I'm okay. Just flash bombs. Move out. Go! Okay, come on, come on. You must be on some vitamin program. Re-group! Let's go. Kimberly. Freeze! Drop and eat the floor, scumbag! Like I said, I'm NEC. Here's my badge. I have a radiation victim! You tell me! He's dying, you're getting exposed. You decide! What do you want me to do? Back up! Look, I told you, I'm OSI. And I said kiss the floor right now or you're dead! Like I said. I'm one of the good guys. You don't mind if I borrow this? Everyone out of that building! Come on, come on, come on. Jaime, they're getting away in the NEC truck. They're headed east on Bay Road. I'm going after them. Brava, my dear. You even had me convinced. That Delta Commander back there is going to tell the world a renegade member of the OSI did this. Good thing you love me. I'm finished, Miles. I know. What is that? Our little insurance policy. Once we board the sub, poof! No one left to follow us. Turn right, turn right! You know the route, concentrate. Don't let that happen again. Steve. What? Nothing. Steve. Kimberly's driving the truck. Well, I'm not leaving you. Rudy gave me a few new options. Wait till you see what he has in store for you. I can hardly wait. Dr. Sommers, if you can hear me? He has a remote. He can launch the missile from here. insurance, my dear! Kendrick has a remote. He's going to launch the missile. Insurance! Not bad. Sometimes old-fashioned is the way to go. You've been telling me that for 20 years. You know, we're definitely getting too old for this. Let's go home. Wow. Friends, we are gathered here today to join in the holy state of matrimony Jaime Sommers and Steve Austin. I do. Not yet. You do, huh? Yes. I sure do. Wait a minute. We haven't come to that part yet. Yeah, we have. Is that it? Do you Jaime Sommers take Steve Austin to be your lawful wedded husband? To have and to hold, to cherish in sickness and in health, for ever more, till death do you part? Excuse me? Now you can say it. I now pronounce you husband and wife. Way to go, pal. Now, can we talk about kids?
