It is a stunning moment, Dana. The disgraced 45th President of the United States and First Lady Melania Trump walking to Marine One for their last ride. Ladies and gentlemen, the President-Elect of the United States, Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. And Dr. Jill Biden. There was huge security issues that day. Fears after January 6th and a lot of steps and precautions that were being taken. We couldn't even get close enough to drive here on our first day. So actually, all of the senior staff all met at the zoo and we got on buses, and we all were watching the inauguration on our phones. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., do solemnly swear. I, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., do solemnly swear. That I will faithfully execute... I was not out on the mall watching the speeches, but rather sitting in the situation room watching the secure monitors where we had up on the screen the command centers for DHS and FBI, because we were worried about the potential for unrest or violence. This is America's Day. This is democracy's day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. Even in that moment of joy, of renewal, people were extremely conscious of the inheritance we had. Thinking about the challenges we were facing at home, I knew that as Secretary of State, I would have to be in some way explaining that around the world. We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril, and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain. Hello, Cathy. Hello, sir. Good evening, everyone. On behalf of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, I am delighted to welcome you to the swearing in of the day one appointees of the Biden-Harris administration. We are joined by hundreds of White House staff and hundreds more agency appointees, all of us here... There was a nervousness about COVID, even among us, and we were pretty informed people. So many of our meetings were done over Zoom. I'm looking at all your photographs and I'm supposed to be looking straight ahead, but I want to take a look at you while I'm talking to you. You know, this was not business as usual. This was not normal. It was an incredibly challenging week around here. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on this historic day. I was doing a briefing for the first time that day, which also was not typically done. We just felt it was important to do a briefing on that first day to send a message to the world we were going to return to respect for the freedom of press and that engagement. President Biden also officially appointed a COVID-19 Response Coordinator, a position and team we had already previously announced, but made it official today to create a unified national response to the pandemic. On day one, the first full day of the presidency, we only had the small core of a team here at the White House. The few of us that showed up in the building, and I was one of, like, four people on the COVID team that showed up in the building. We couldn't even be, uh, near one another. We all knew that this was going to be a race against time. Hospitals were full. Only two percent of the public had been vaccinated. In December, as we started to make the transition, we kept asking for the plan, and there wasn't a plan. So the team came together and put together a plan. On that first day, we knew we were meeting with the President. Within a couple of hours, the President was announcing the strategy. And we didn't have the ability to sign on to our computers. We had to figure out where to print. And then the hardest thing was the binding. So, we had a loose-leaf folder, notebook, alternative or backup plan, and at the last minute, one member of the team figured out how to get it bound. So, just in time, we walked into a press conference where the President, you know, rolled out the plan. Mr. President, how are you? You're going to be doing a lot of talking for the next while. - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you. Good afternoon. Today, today, I am unveiling the National Strategy on COVID-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our plan starts with mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign to meet our goal of administering 100 million shots in our first 100 days in office. We're on day one. I'm going down to the White House for the first time since Biden was elected. I covered the White House for years under the end of the Clinton administration and then through the first six years of George W. Bush. Then I've been off for a number of years working on big national security projects. - Good morning. - How are you? But I'm coming back to the White House this year and doing it mostly to see how this team come together to try to pull the United States out of the hole that it finds itself in around the world. Today, uh, the administration announced a historic new donation in the global fight to defeat COVID-19. This is a period of such remarkable division in the country. From the racial reckoning that was playing out in the streets in the summer of 2020 to President Trump's big lie that he had been cheated out of the election to the rioting and horror of January 6. It all played into a Russian and Chinese narrative that America was in terminal decline. For Biden, the biggest challenge is to make clear that democracy could be a winning formula for everybody. And to do that, he brought back the people he knew best. Alright. His chief of staff, Ron Klain, has been with him for years and years, including as Chief of Staff when he was vice President. Here or here. Here? He ended up picking as his National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who at 44 was one of the youngest people ever to be in the job, but had already been his National Security Adviser as Vice President. Where do you guys want me? - You're gonna be right here. - Alright. His Secretary of State is Sullivan's predecessor, Tony Blinken, who had served for years as the National Security Adviser to Biden while he was in the Senate. Blinken was also the Deputy Secretary of State under John Kerry, Obama's Secretary of State. And Biden brought Kerry back as his climate czar. Do you mind taking off your mask? You know, we've grown nervous of it today because we're hearing about cases. They put Kerry in the White House because putting him in the State Department would have been a little bit uncomfortable. He would have been reporting to his former deputy. Okay. You guys gonna sit? - Yep. - Yep. For his Secretary of Defense, Biden chose Lloyd Austin, a retired general he had known for a decade and who had been a friend of Biden's late son Beau. Vice President Kamala Harris: I, William Burns. I, William Burns... And finally, as his director of the CIA, Biden chose Bill Burns. Burns had been ambassador to Moscow under President Bush, and there's no one in the administration who knew Vladimir Putin better. I spent the first decade of my career as a diplomat at the end of the Cold War. I would never underestimate in dealing with President Putin over the last couple of decades, his risk appetite. Vladimir Putin! President Biden has a history with President Putin. They had met when President Biden was Vice President, a very memorable meeting that I was part of in the dacha that, uh, that President Putin had just outside of Moscow. Then-Vice President Biden was in the study with Putin. They were very close to each other. And Vice President Biden looked at him and said, "I'm looking in your eyes, and I can't say that I can see your soul." And Putin laughed and said, "Good, we understand each other." Good afternoon. It's great to be here with you today. So first, what happened? Hackers launched a broad and indiscriminate effort to compromise the network management software used by both government and the private sector. An advanced persistent threat actor, likely of Russian origin, was responsible. Biden has an immediate problem with Russia, one he's going to have to deal with in the next few weeks. And it's called SolarWinds. The hack of the federal government and more than a hundred American corporations was the deepest, most sophisticated hack of the United States that's ever been accomplished. Russians managed to slip in through this software that was put out by this company called SolarWinds. What was remarkable about this was its sophistication and the residency, the duration of the residency, of that intrusion in government systems. These Russian hackers have been in these US governments since March and remain there. This is an ongoing, widespread espionage operation. The alarm, I think, was quite, um, significant. It was an alert that we're entering into a new chapter in our relationship with Russia. What are we going to do about it? Three things. First, finding and expelling the adversary. Second, building back better to modernize federal defenses and reduce the risk of this happening again. And finally, potential response options to the perpetrators. They're in a tough spot here. We know that in the next few weeks, the United States is going to begin a series of sanctions against Russia. But Jake Sullivan, the National Security Adviser, has made clear sanctions alone are not enough. And then the question is, can they establish some kind of deterrent, which so far has failed completely? When you think about the challenge that Biden faces, he's in the position of being in adversarial relationships from the start with the two other major nuclear superpowers in the world, Russia and China. And the only way he's going to be able to make that work is if he can organize the allies with him. Because of the past four years, what I heard from my colleagues was, "Welcome back." Thank God you're back. We're so happy to see you. It was a love fest my first few weeks here in New York. With our fellow democracies having experienced the US retreat for four years, there's a sort of a sense of, "Okay, phew, uh, now we can actually build these alliances again." But there's also a sense that democracies need to, to pull together, that we need all hands on deck. We are really in a global struggle between democracy and autocracy. And in the last decade, autocracy has been on the rise. The way we view it, and the President views it, is that it is an ongoing fight, and it will continue to be, because there will always be powers pushing for autocracy. The problem is the United States is in a particularly weak position to have that argument. I mean, in terms of how you want a political system to run, there are, there are countries around the world that would say, "I might want my country to run like Germany or Japan or Canada." There's no one around the world that looks at the United States and says, "I wish my political system would run like that." USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Well, thank you very much. And hello, CPAC, do you miss me yet? Do you miss me? President Trump's behavior this year as an outgoing President is certainly unprecedented and very different than what the other 44 people who held this office had done. Remember how quiet Obama was when Trump first came in? He said, "Look, you know, he won. This is his time. I'm not going to be here criticizing him at every turn." Trump did no such thing. Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any President in modern history. That's true. When you look at the polls of Republicans, you still get a very substantial number, nearly a majority, who believe Biden is not legitimately elected President of United States. I don't know how you get past that. This election was rigged. And the Supreme Court and other courts didn't want to do anything about it. I will say it's probably what we expected. His behavior as President was unprecedented, and so there was no reason to think his post-Presidential behavior would be unprecedented, I suppose. Keep going up. - Okay. - Okay. We made a conscious decision when the President came into office that we didn't want to make his presidency a continued campaign and battle with Donald Trump. Alright, guys. The lesson we took from the American people was that they wanted to take the venom out of our politics. Okay, what are follow-ups? Follow-up on Abbott, and Mexico, on the other side of the border. The migrants arriving from Texas... President Biden wanted me to take the temperature down in the country. There's concern about their treatment. I don't think we need to, like, change our posture because it's not everything. After years of questioning the legitimacy of the press, not having normal briefings, lying, I mean, returning to a version of normal. I don't think we have any update on that, although maybe we can check and see what the status is. I think what people have seen is after the four years that predated President Biden is, um, you know, US... What US leadership should look like and what it looks like to stand up for democracy. I'll find an answer for that. Relations between the United States and China will face a new test as officials from both sides meet in Alaska. The discussions are expected to be frosty, with Beijing warning that compromise is not on the cards. We went to Anchorage, myself and Secretary of State Blinken, to meet with our counterparts from the People's Republic of China for a multi-hour session to go through the full range of issues in the US-China relationship. Bitterly cold, not exactly a shock. It was Alaska in the late winter. On behalf of National Security Adviser Sullivan and myself, I want to welcome Director Yang, State Councilor Wang, to Alaska. And thank you very much for making the journey to meet with us. We wanted to be able to tell them directly our concerns about some of the actions that China has taken recently, challenging not just our interests but our values. Our administration is committed to leading with diplomacy to advance the interests of the United States and to strengthen the rules-based international order. The transition identified a few basic propositions about what we expected from China. We believe that the Chinese government had made a decision that they were going to attempt to surpass or displace the United States in terms of being the world's leading economic and military power. That this next decade was a decisive decade, and that we were going to have to deal with a more assertive, more aggressive China and that we had to tool-up and be prepared for this competition. We've said to them, you want to play, you want to be a superpower. With being a superpower comes responsibility. Uh, with that, there are certain rules of the road that you have to abide by. We'll also discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies. We wanted an opportunity to explain how we see the world, what America's interests are. And I would say that we actually accomplished all of those objectives. Now, there were some of the public fireworks. This is not supposed to be the way one should welcome his guests. We wonder if this is a decision made by the United States to try to gain some advantage in dealing with China. But certainly this is miscalculated and only reflects the vulnerability and weakness inside the United States. I see a confidence level among my Chinese colleagues that over the years I had not seen before. They have come in with a, with a sense of power and a sense of strength. They came up with this term "Wolf Warrior" to describe their diplomats. When you're talking about your diplomats as Wolf Warriors, that says something. And that's what was on display in Anchorage. We hope that the United States will do better on human rights. The challenges facing the United States in human rights are deep seated. They did not just emerge over the past four years, such as Black Lives Matter. It was a kind of classic whataboutism that we saw from the Soviet Union back in the day. It didn't work then. We don't think it's going to work for the PRC either. It was, "You want to talk to us about human rights. We're going to tell you about human rights" kind of thing. So part of my reaction was, we've seen this movie before. Part of my reaction was, uh, "Man, they're really going for it." The United States has never seen an adversary like this before. Biden knew that for ten years, Washington was trying to make a pivot to Asia, but something always got in the way. And he was determined that he was going to execute on it. Good afternoon. I'm speaking to you today from the Roosevelt, the Treaty Room in the White House. I'm now the fourth United States President to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans. Two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth. We have to focus on the challenges that are in front of us. We have to shore up American competitiveness to meet the stiff competition we're facing from an increasingly assertive China. It's time for American troops to come home. You go back to when we came in, a deal had already been struck that our forces were going to be out of Afghanistan by May. The Taliban had said, "Hey, if you're not out of the country by the, "by, by, by May 1st, then we're going to start attacking you again." So this really doesn't give President Biden a long time to work through this process. His choice is to either increase our footprint significantly or he can make a choice to, uh, decide to leave. It's time to end the forever war. Thank you all for listening. May God protect our troops. May God bless all those families who lost someone in this endeavor. If you listen to the speech, it sounded pretty simple. We were just going to pick those forces up and bring them home. Very popular among Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike. But what was important about that announcement is what's missing. There's no plan for bringing out the people who had helped the American troops, had helped journalists, had helped contractors, and who will be targets of the Taliban. The pace of the vaccine rollout slowly picking up. The federal government sending out an additional one million doses this week to 6,500 select pharmacies across the US. The main event was vaccinate more people more quickly, period, no matter what. We felt that we were racing against an enemy. We quickly deployed the Defense Production Act, worked with the vaccine manufacturers, helped them get additional equipment, raw material. So we were able to lock in in the first few weeks of the presidency enough supply for all Americans by July. And then we were able to accelerate that. And actually by April 19th, all Americans were eligible for the vaccine. In my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. We've spent every day since attempting to carry it out. But that wasn't the only problem. Not just supply. There weren't enough vaccinators. We're mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one's arm. There weren't enough places for people to get vaccinated. Calling active duty military, retired doctors and nurses, administrators. We stood up these big federal FEMA sites. We created a Web text line for people to be able to find a place to get vaccinated. Things are slowly changing. 32.8 million Americans have received at least one dose. That's about 10 percent of the population now. Nearly 90 million Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine. The President had set a goal for us of 100 million shots in 100 days. We did 100 million shots in 58 days. President Biden's ability to get the country vaccinated and back to work, that's democracy delivering. And that is the debate that we have struggled to have in recent years, because we weren't able to do in the last four or five years those, those big things. If we do this together, by July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day. When we came in, of course, the most dominant thing has been COVID, and that certainly changed the way that, uh, that we were doing business. Well, good morning. Well, good afternoon. Good evening. Let me start by thanking China and Foreign Minister Wong for initiating this critical discussion. COVID has been an enormous crimp on diplomacy. Hey, folks. Diplomacy is always better person-to-person, country-to-country like that. Thank you very much, President Fernandez, for your leadership and thank you for convening this timely conversation. Thankfully, we got to the place where we could start to, to get out there, actually see people. Good morning. Good morning. Great, great to see you. We've had the opportunity to see each other and work together in Brussels at NATO, but it was mask-to-mask and now it's finally face-to-face. So that's really, really good news. So a lot... When you think about any of the challenges that we face, whether it's COVID, whether it's climate change... Lots to talk about. I'm just grateful for the opportunity to be able to spend some time today. Not a single one of them can be effectively addressed by any one country acting alone. Even the United States. With Russia, the way President Biden sees it is this, it makes the most sense for us to see if we can have a stable, predictable relationship. Please, have a seat. On the other hand, we've also been equally clear that if the Russian government chooses to act aggressively or recklessly challenging our interests, challenging our values, threatening friends or partners, we'll respond. In late March, heading into April, we began to see indications of a massive Russian military buildup around Ukraine. The President received multiple briefings from his intelligence community, his military experts. Our concern is that nations respect some measure of a rules-based international order where countries don't arbitrarily attack other countries and change the borders. I mean, we've heard Putin say before he thought the fact that the Soviet empire broke apart was one of the worst things that he had ever witnessed in his lifetime. So does he have a desire to, to reconstitute something that looks like that? I mean, that could be the case. We made clear that these actions are simply unacceptable and are not going to go unanswered. They're not going to be allowed to happen with impunity. You saw the international community in many countries stand up and raise concern and alarm about the buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine's border. And in the weeks after that, we saw Russia pull back many of its forces and much of the equipment. Not all. It still represents a real concern. I think at that point the Russians were surprised at how quickly, now that we were actually talking to our allies again, we were able to pull together a more united response. But they sometimes tactically de-escalate. It doesn't mean that they strategically de-escalate. I think it remains to be seen. This is the second stop on a very carefully choreographed first foreign trip for President Biden. The Group of Seven meeting that just took place in Western England was really about demonstrating that the alliance is back. The meeting here in NATO is to play the anti-Trump. To say that our obligations to our NATO allies to come to their aid, is what Biden has called a sacred obligation of the United States. The change is obvious. After four years of an administration which had shaped the foreign policy of the US in a way which made the functioning of alliances quite challenging, it has created positive expectations. I want America to be the leading nation in the world. But the Biden administration faced a potentially very large challenge. Allies were looking at them very warily. Even among the European leaders. You're hearing this set of doubts about whether or not Joe Biden, who they're delighted to meet here in Europe, is actually the blip, not the change. But each of these officials have their own dynamics that are keeping them from fully signing on to the Biden agenda. They're willing to stand up to China, but not so willing that they're going to cut off all their trade in luxury German cars. Yeah, they're willing to go stand up to Vladimir Putin, but not so willing that they will cut off the pipeline that's bringing them natural gas direct from Russia and routing around Ukraine. So everybody's engaging in their own hedging strategies. And meanwhile, President Biden wants to show up at Putin's doorstep and basically say, "You're outnumbered." Tonight, President Biden in Geneva, just hours before that critical face-to-face meeting with Vladimir Putin. A major test for President Biden who requested this summit. It's important to recognize how this summit came into being. President Biden called President Putin and said, "I'm going to impose a series of sanctions on you "for what you've done with SolarWinds "and what you've done with election interference. But I want to sit down and talk." So they arrive at this beautiful estate where the conference was to be held. They have this stiff greeting at the entrance way. And then there was this scrum of Russian reporters pushing American reporters as they tried to get into the room. Everyone, take a step back! We're not going in! One of my colleagues telling me that one of the Russians put his hand right up to his throat to get him up out of the way. So, I would say that the press corps behavior wasn't all that different from the national behavior. It was a calm, determined atmosphere on both sides of the table in Geneva. There was a sense in the room of we're going to have harsh, in some cases, unrelenting differences on various issues. But this is a channel where we can talk plainly to one another and come to some understandings. I would say that the two men had a depth of familiarity with one another. Kind of understood where the other was coming from in terms of their perspective, even though they disagreed vigorously on things. Now, those understandings could be, "You're going to do X, and I'm going to respond," or they could be, "We can work through this." But that's really what you felt in the room. Donald Trump could not get his head around the idea that Ukraine was an independent state. Biden and all of his team come in and reaffirm the traditional threat of the US-Ukrainian relationship. We have visits by the Secretary of Defense General Austin. We have more exercises going on between Ukraine and NATO forces. For Putin, this is not just an affront, but it's a bit of a shock. Did you commit in these meetings to stop threatening Ukraine? From the Russians' perspective, Ukraine may not end up in NATO, but NATO is ending up in Ukraine. And that becomes impermissible for Putin. I communicated the United States' unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. I did what I came to do, communicate directly, directly, that the United States will respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. Now, here's the interesting question: Did Putin believe him? Putin might think that the United States, at the end of the day, is going to come to the conclusion that it can't risk getting on an escalation ladder that it can't control. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. As we moved to summer, we had gone from hundreds of thousands of cases a day to 10,000 cases a day. We'd gone from thousands and thousands of deaths down to 200 deaths a day. We were doing four million vaccinations in a day. Variants were emerging in other countries, but there seemed to be a reasonable case that we would have a limited amount of case growth come back, and it would be isolated and targeted in regions of the country. Just think back to where this nation was a year ago. Think back to where you were a year ago and think about how far we've come. We'd seen cases go down. We had vaccines available for everybody in the country. We had a lot of resources, um, to fight the pandemic. Today, all across this nation, we can say with confidence, America is coming back together. But we didn't have a sense clearly of, uh, the impact of new variants. Residents and officials here are confused about an outbreak that is stemming from large July 4th celebrations that happened here just a couple weeks ago. Out on the Cape, an uptick in COVID cases serving as a reminder that while the vaccines are highly effective, they're still not 100 percent protective. It became clear that we were going to be dealing with much higher case counts than we thought. The Delta variant is now taking hold in the US Ten percent of new cases now and doubling every two weeks. It took this sort of very clean story of vaccinated and unvaccinated, um, and it said, you know what, it's vaccinated, yes, but with an asterisk. There was a wall we were hitting of people willing to get vaccinated, and that's when we started to get concerned. Some states are pushing back, blocking health officials from promoting the vaccine. COVID had been a politically divisive issue around the issue of masks before we got here. But I believed that when you had a vaccine that President Trump had boasted that he had developed, that the FDA under his leadership had approved the vaccine, the idea that his supporters would refuse to take a vaccine that was developed on his watch, that was approved on his watch, was something that I did not expect in the numbers that we have seen. Good afternoon. Earlier today, I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of US forces and Allied forces in Afghanistan. When I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out by September, and we're on track to meet that target. Excuse me. Our military mission... The assessment across the government was that even in worst-case scenarios, as our forces withdrew from Afghanistan, that the Afghanistan government, the Afghanistan security forces, would hold well into the following year. Is the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable? No. I believed strongly that we were going to have a robust embassy, an embassy presence in, in Kabul, certainly through the year, well into the next year. There's going to be no circumstance for you to see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy in the, of the United States, from Afghanistan. Everything that we planned and did was based on that assumption. To Afghanistan, the Taliban seizing control of more and more territory. Taliban militants blast their way into Kunduz. The Taliban has captured the capital of Baghlan province. It's the eighth province now to fall in a short number of days. On Wednesday, August 11th, the President convened us in The Situation Room for an update. Some of the outlying provincial capitals had begun to fall, and he was increasingly concerned about what might happen in Kabul. The President posed a series of direct questions to his national security team about whether we had to activate the contingency planning that we had put in place over the course of several months. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense recommended to him that we put the forces that we had already set in place, that we put them on what's called a "prepare to deploy" order. Afghanistan was the first big international issue that dominated the airwaves and was on everybody's minds. Okay. A lot going on today. We are closely watching the deteriorating security conditions in parts of the country, uh, but no particular outcome, in our view, is inevitable. - Jen. - Jen. We were playing catch-up from the moment the President took office. Middle of the night on Wednesday night, or in the early hours of Thursday morning, I was woken up by a phone call from Chairman Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He informed me that the Taliban had taken a city called Ghazni, which is on the highway approach to Kabul. And he said, "It's now my judgment "that it's gone past 'prepare to deploy.' We need to deploy. And that would be my recommendation to the President." To the other breaking news, President Biden announcing he is sending additional troops into Afghanistan to help evacuate US embassy personnel and Afghan visa applicants. Biden defending the drawdown in a statement writing, "One more year or five more years "of US military presence "would not have made a difference "if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country." You keep changing the subject to whether or not we should be there forever. And I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about whether or not this exit was done properly. Taking out all the service members, and then you have to send people back in. That's the definition of, oh, we shouldn't have taken those troops out because now we have to send twice as many back in. The thing that we were up against in that time period was a very basic tension. And it was a tension between moving fast to fly people out before instability had really set in, thus potentially triggering that instability, triggering panic, um, or standing by the government who was asking us not to do that. We were in intense conversations with the Afghan government throughout this period of August and, and into the middle of the month to help organize a peaceful transfer of power. And President Ghani said to me on the phone that Saturday, "If the Taliban doesn't agree and engage in good faith, then I will stay and fight to the death." That was Saturday. He fled the country the next day on Sunday. - No notice? - No notice. We begin with Afghanistan and the dramatic fall of the capital. Helicopters and black smoke, visible American diplomats, including the ambassador, evacuated to the airport. At least 500 staff leaving the country so far. The embassy shuttered. The flag coming down. My God. Not only were people pulled out of the embassy, we were pulling people off of the tarmac. Chaos at the airport as thousands of Afghans desperate to get out. Afghan civilians desperately fleeing the airport. Packed commercial flights fully booked. Many who work for the US forces searching for visas to get out. One former translator pleading for Americans to help. Tonight, the worst predictions for Afghanistan's future coming true. This country now under Taliban rule. It's an embarrassment. It's a stain on our national reputation. Imagine if there were hundreds or even thousands of effective American hostages that are trapped in Afghanistan because of Joe Biden's chaotic, disorganized, ill-planned evacuation from that country. Let me lay out the current mission in Afghanistan. I was asked to authorize, and I did, 6,000 US troops to deploy to Afghanistan for the purpose of assisting in the departure of US and Allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan. Operation Allies Refugee has already moved 2,000 Afghans who are eligible for special immigration visas and their families to the United States. In the coming days, the US military will provide assistance to move more SIV eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan. We were executing this incredibly complex, incredibly difficult, historic evacuation of civilians from Afghanistan. He's a friend. It had gone beyond, I think, anyone's expectations in terms of the size and scope. US. US. The thing we thought about every day was would Americans wind up giving their lives in the service of that mission? We knew it was a risk. The President knew it was a risk every single day. We knew there were terrorists in Kabul. We knew there were terrorists trying to kill Americans. To try and ensure that the Taliban weren't going to in any way obstruct the evacuation that was underway, the President asked me to go to Kabul to meet with Mullah Baradar and some of the other Taliban leadership. We met at the old civilian terminal at Kabul International Airport. The setting was quite tense around the room in which we were meeting over a couple of hours. You know, we had both of our security detachments outside kind of eyeing each other very warily. Mullah Baradar reaffirmed that the Taliban were not going to obstruct the evacuation effort. Certainly shared the concern about ISIS threats in that period. They were seeing much the same threat stream that we were seeing. We had incredible intelligence about attacks by ISIS-K that were in the offing. Of course, we didn't have the specificity, but honestly, this was like a, a slow-motion nightmare. You know it's happening, but you can't do anything about it. A couple of days after, I was in The Situation Room with the other principals getting ready for a National Security Council meeting with the President. General McKenzie, the commander of CENTCOM, was on the video screen from his headquarters and mentioned just before the meeting began that he had just gotten handed a report about an attack at Abbey Gate at Kabul International Airport. President came into the room shortly thereafter, and at that point, General McKenzie informed him. You know, we didn't have, uh, all the facts all at once. They kept coming in, and we heard... the casualty count go up through the course of the meeting. We have just learned from the Pentagon. This is their statement. "We can confirm that a number "of US service members were killed "at the Kabul Airport. "A number of Afghans fell victim to this heinous attack." It causes you to stop and reflect for a minute and, and think about, you know, what you just heard. I felt it intensely because the men and women of my department had been at those very same gates for almost two weeks, helping to pull people to safety. I remember the President just paused for, you know, at least 30 seconds or so and put his head down because he was absorbing, you know, the, um, you know, the sadness of the moment and the, and the sense of loss as well. This is not surprising to this White House and to the Biden administration because they've been warning publicly for days that it could happen. But regardless, a nightmare scenario. Something they've been very sensitive to the possibility of. And it has now happened. Unquestionably, that day was the hardest day of the first year, no question about it. And, uh, you know... he is the President of the United States. He is the Commander-in-Chief. He is also a father and someone who sent one of his sons to go serve in the Middle East. I believe... this is the right decision, a wise decision and the best decision for America. We're engaged in a serious competition with China. We're dealing with the challenges on multiple fronts with Russia. The world is changing. I've known Biden's cabinet, most of them for many years. These are not stupid people. They're experienced people. They're smart people. And they got this really wrong. Suddenly, they're seen to be incompetent. Had Biden, after he made the decision in April to pull out of Afghanistan, immediately begun speeding up the withdrawal of the Afghans who had helped Americans, then I think August could have played out very differently. Instead, by the end of the summer, there was a sense that things were really falling apart. Delta was raging. In April, almost 70 percent of voters said they approved of the President's performance on COVID. That number has fallen to 53 percent. The disapproval has risen to 44 percent. A dramatic change. The number of new COVID cases is higher now than during last summer's peak. Weekly hospital admissions are up more than 40 percent. We had an opportunity, and I really do think it was an opportunity, to show that we, too, could sacrifice for one another. And I think the question that I most underestimated was, would we be willing to say that none of us are more important than all of us? Or would we fall into the pattern that most people would have thought we would have fallen into, which is to say that, no, we each individually are more important. And I think it's one of the reasons we've suffered so greatly. 700,000 Americans now have lost their lives to COVID. One person is dying in America every 43 seconds. One in 500 Americans are dead now. Biden's first year could be defined more by COVID than anything else. Remember, Biden is the guy that said by 4th of July, if you just stick with me and wear the masks, we're going to, we won't have to do that anymore. And that's just not the case. World leaders gathering in Scotland this morning following G20 sit-downs in Italy over the weekend. The summit is being billed as the world's last best chance to curb the climate crisis. More than 100 heads of state have been arriving in Glasgow this morning. But in addition to world leaders, dozens of corporate CEOs, fund managers, and venture capital firms will be here over the two weeks. Noticeably absent will be China's President Xi and Russia's President Putin. There's a lot at stake here. In 2018, the IPCC scientists told us that we really have 12 years within which we must make and implement the key decisions to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. And, unfortunately, we lost three years during the Trump administration where we pulled out of the Paris Agreement. I do believe that this is our last, best chance not to solve it all in one blow here, but to get on the track where we keep 1.5 degrees alive as the limit of the raising of temperature on the planet. Hello, Senator. Good to see you've made it out, sir. How are you doing? Do you think we'll be successful? I do indeed. Yes, I do. Keep your fingers crossed then, eh? Yes, sir. Thank you. By and large, the Biden administration has been highly disciplined, highly coordinated. I love it, I love the accent. - I loved that. I love that. - "Keep your fingers crossed." But John Kerry is a former Secretary of State, a former presidential nominee himself. This is the last big job of his career. And he felt like he could say what he wanted to go say. And so on China, they were not at times on the same page. I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China, with respect to China not showing up. The rest of the world are going to look to China and say, "What value added are they providing?" It came as a surprise that Biden offered really strong criticism to Xi for not coming himself to Glasgow because the Kerry strategy on China was largely to work behind closed doors, avoid sort of any open conflicts. I have to imagine it was strategic. What we know now is that they were brokering this sort of last-minute US-China pacts the last days of Glasgow. And so one has to assume there was some pause, rift, something in the discussions that would have led this administration to think this will help. The US and China have struck a deal on climate change. The announcement came during the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The United States and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate... And climate cooperation is the only way to get this job done. This US-China announcement is both huge and kind of small. You know, it's small in the sense that none of this stuff is truly groundbreaking. But I think in that moment, just the two of them coming out publicly and saying, we're going to work together, we're committed, it was a big deal. The Biden administration came in as the Trump administration went out, with a clear focus on China. China is definitely in that old Cold War terms of a system challenge, saying that its system is better than ours. But Russia's saying, "Hey, it's not just about China. "We're here and we matter, and you'd better pay attention to us." In the fall, we began to pick up a variety of indications that the Russians were conducting a significant... Significant would be an understatement... Massive military buildup around Ukraine. They have so much forward firepower that they are assembling. Um, it's on a level that is not comparable to what they did in April. The President decided that we would begin down a dual track of deterrence on the one hand and diplomacy on the other. So we asked Bill Burns to go to Moscow quietly. The President asked me to go to Moscow to convey to President Putin and some of his most senior advisers our serious concern about what we were seeing. This was in the midst of the fourth big wave of the COVID pandemic in Russia. So Moscow was locked down. President Putin was in isolation in Sochi at that point. I found President Putin to be quite measured but unapologetic about Russian concerns about Ukraine. I think over time his confidence has grown. In some ways, his appetite for risk has grown. I think his sense of personal legacy has probably deepened over time. I conveyed on the President's behalf a message of serious consequences that would flow from a Russian decision to renew military aggression against Ukraine. We wanted to communicate that if Putin moved on Ukraine, there would be severe consequences from the United States and our allies. If Putin wanted to go down the diplomatic road, the United States was prepared to travel that road with him. President Biden holding a high-stakes virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin right now. The two leaders speaking via videoconference today as a potential geopolitical crisis is currently unfolding. Hello. Good to see you again. I, unfortunately, we didn't get to see one another at the G20. I hope next time we meet, we do it in person. The buildup that Russia was engaged in was continuing. We had to have, and we did have, deep, deep concern. Like all the conversations between President Biden and President Putin, there have now been several in person in Geneva, by video conference on the phone, they're very direct, they're not polemical. There's not a lot of wasted time. And President Biden made very clear to President Putin that if Russia committed renewed acts of aggression against Ukraine, there would be significant costs. Biden is confronting the question of how does the United States support Ukraine without getting its troops directly into an old-time border conflict in defense of a country that isn't even a NATO ally? And when Biden had his teleconference with Putin, the two men knew one thing: Whatever Putin did next, whether he rolled his troops or not, the US was not going to put its own military into harm's way to defend Ukraine. They never were on the table. And are you ready to send American troops into war and go into Ukraine to fight Russians on the battlefield? Look, here's the deal. I've made it absolutely clear to President Putin, it's the last thing I'll say, that if he moves on Ukraine, the economic consequences for his economy are going to be devastating. Devastating. We have proceeded very deliberately but also, in some cases, quietly. For example, in December, the President approved $200 million for additional defense equipment to Ukraine. We didn't advertise it at the time. We just went forward with doing it because one of the plays in the Russian playbook is to create, invent, point to some kind of provocation, and to use that as justification for something they'd been planning all along. And we did not want to play into that, at least not in any overt way. The question haunting the White House is whether this is enough. Because if Ukraine falls, Russia will, for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, be redrawing the map of Europe. And more importantly, it will be showing that it believes it can push back on a world that was dominated by the United States from the Soviet collapse forward. On this January 6th, solemn ceremonies at the US Capitol replaced the violent scenes of rioters ransacking the building one year ago. There is still a political divide that's very apparent and even with today's ceremonies as well. Among my many reactions on January 6th was just mortification at how we appear to the rest of the world. This day is a reminder that Trumpism is very much with us and that our democracy remains very much at risk. Let us acknowledge today our fallen heroes of that day. I ask all members to rise for a moment of silence in their memory. What else are Democrats going to talk about? They gonna talk about 30-year-high inflation. They gonna talk about the fact crime is up in every major urban area. They gonna talk about 1.7 million illegal immigrants coming into this country. They gonna talk about the attacks on the First Amendment. Um, what are they going to talk about? Oh, so, January 6th. That today there are members of Congress trying to act like that wasn't a big deal, we should just move on, I find hard to be reconciled with. And there's not much more we can say, but we'll keep background names off the record, any reporters... We started discussing in the fall what that day would look like and what that should mean for the President and what he should have to say on that day. We all agreed that it was an important moment for him to be more direct about what that day meant, what former President Trump's role in that day meant for history, and why we need to prevent it from ever happening again. Alright, guys, um, we will catch up with you soon. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your stuff. Uh, big day. We saw with our own eyes rioters menace these halls. What did we not see? We didn't see a former President who had just rallied the mob to attack. Sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours. It didn't mean that it was the start of every day President Biden was going to go out and talk about Donald Trump. But that day felt like it uniquely required President Biden to go out and really be direct and call out the former President for his role. Those who stormed this Capitol and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America. Make no mistake about it. We're living at an inflection point in history. We're engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, from China, to Russia, and beyond. They're betting that democracy's days are numbered. Good afternoon, everyone. Very good to see folks here. And to those I haven't had a chance to say this to, Happy New Year. Um, this morning, NATO's North Atlantic Council met to discuss our coordinated response to Russia's military buildup along the Ukraine border and its increasingly sharp threats and inflammatory rhetoric. No one should be surprised if Russia instigates a provocation or incident, then tries to use it to justify military intervention, hoping that by the time the world realizes the ruse, it'll be too late. We were working overtime to organize allies and partners throughout Europe. They also wanted to make sure that we were proceeding in a deliberate way and not being perceived as fueling a fire in any way. Vladimir Putin didn't pick Ukraine for nothing. He knew that it wasn't a member of NATO. And I think deep down he thought the NATO alliance would be splintered on the question of whether or not to gather together to push him back. When he went into Crimea in 2014, it took about a year for the allies to get together and decide on some sanctions. And by that time, the sanctions were so weakened they had basically no effect. Eight years later, Putin was still in Crimea. Biden wasn't going to make that mistake again. Blinken sure as hell wasn't going to make that mistake again because he remembered it vividly from the time that he was in the Obama administration. So when they first saw this massing of troops, they made a very important decision, which was to declassify their intelligence as quickly as they could and publish it. We have information that indicates Russia has already pre-positioned a group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation in Eastern Ukraine. Sometimes they went out and announced it. Sometimes they leaked it to us. The US National Security Adviser says more details will be revealed within the next 24 hours. In a few cases, they called a few of us in and did show some sources and methods just so that we understood they weren't making it up. They knew it would take a while to convince the Europeans that this was no bluff. By mid to late January, not only was Russia still building up forces to the east and the south, but it was engaged in a buildup to the north, particularly sending 30,000 forces to Belarus under the guise of exercises that gave it the option to really hit Ukraine virtually from all sides. It was becoming so clear, including to allies and partners, that this was happening. Our view is this is an extremely dangerous situation. We're now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine. We said that one of the purposes of our foreign policy was to defend this rules-based order, because it comes with certain principles, certain norms, certain expectations that grew out of two World Wars. If you let an aggression against those rules go forward with impunity, then you open a Pandora's box. And you're going to see potentially conflict and war everywhere. And that's one way or another going to draw us in. You've seen country after country coming together, standing up. I think it has been a reassertion of American engagement, American leadership... and a recommitment by many countries to defend this rules-based order. The discussion today with Mr. Lavrov was frank and substantive. We've made it clear to the Russians that not only would there be severe economic and financial consequences, but they would also see more support to build up NATO's defensive capacities. As we've continued to see the accumulation of combat power and as we have now seen that, so far anyway, Mr. Putin has not elected to de-escalate, all that combined has led us to want to contribute more capabilities to the Ukrainian armed forces and be ready to contribute more capabilities to our NATO allies. Who knows what's going on in Putin's mind. Whether or not he believes that the international community will carry through is one issue, uh, but what I believe is that our President is very serious. I believe that other leaders in the region are very serious. I believe that the world will take this as a, as a very, very serious issue if he invades Ukraine. We just hope that he makes the right decisions. And, uh, and I'll leave it at that. As Putin was building up his forces, he went off to the opening of the Beijing Olympics. The very fact that he was going there was remarkable because he'd been in complete isolation. When Bill Burns went over, he made Burns go over to a Russian government office and call Putin on the phone. But he was willing to go see Xi Jinping and the day that they met, the two countries turned out this extraordinarily long document describing their common interests, their dedication to working together in the future, their joint pushback on an America that sets the rules, on a West that expands its influence. A lot of people speculated that Putin would not begin the invasion while the Olympics were on because he wouldn't want to anger the Chinese by interrupting their big event. And he held true to that. Oh! It was unprovoked, but Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed on Ukraine. We have heard air raid sirens, loud sirens here in Lviv. This is in the west of the country. Wednesday night was a really pivotal night for us as we were looking at what was happening on the ground, and we were talking a lot internally about when would we call it an invasion? When was it the right time to send the President out? When was it the right time to do a written statement? The President spoke with President Zelenskyy, who basically asked him to condemn what was happening and to keep rallying the world. I mean, those were his primary asks, and that's exactly what he went out the next day and did. Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine. Without provocation, without justification, without necessity. This is a premeditated attack. Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as we've been saying all along. The Biden administration learned a lot of lessons from the mistakes they made in Afghanistan. By the time that the Ukraine crisis came along, they had a better-oiled machine, and they responded by getting out ahead of events instead of being behind them. For weeks, for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen, and now it's unfolding largely as we predicted. It will be difficult for any intelligence agency to predict the outcome of this war or how the Russian army or the Ukrainians will ultimately perform. But on the timing of the invasion, they got everything right. As murky as they were about how quickly the Taliban would take over Afghanistan, they had the Ukraine thing dead on. I want to be clear. The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we've been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half the global economy. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says that he is suspending the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project with Russia. The European Union remain resolutely united as it takes the next step in close coordination with its partners. You know, for the first half of the year, we heard Biden talking about reestablishing old alliances, listening to people, building up what Donald Trump had tried to shatter. And, you know, I think to most of the country, that sounded like diplomatic gobbledygook, like, yeah, sure, it's nice to get along with allies. But Biden knew something, which was the moment would come when you would need that alliance. It came with Ukraine. The United States and our allies and partners will continue to respond to Russia's actions with unity, with clarity, and with conviction. How many White House staffers does it take... To open a package of gum? Don't tell Dr. Fauci how many pieces of gum I've swallowed. This last week, because of the confluence of a number of events that in many ways were unrelated... - Hi! - Hi there. How are you? it was a wild, crazy, exhausting week here. One of the more challenging weeks, uh, since we started. Madam Speaker, the President of the United States. Six days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking it could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine, and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united. And that's what we did. We stayed united. Hang on. I was just about to call you. I'm just disentangling my headphones. Hang on just a second. What's the biggest thought that we're taking away from this? So when Biden first raised, you know, autocracy and democracy at his first press conference a year, a year ago, uh, this wasn't, this wasn't the battle he had in mind. - Yeah. - Right. Ukraine is going to be a constant diplomatic and military effort. It will haunt the next three years of his presidency. What do you do if this ambitious, deadly gambit by Putin succeeds and no one really knows what the world will look like 5 or 10 or 15 years from now. Will this stick? Now is the hour. Our moment of responsibility, our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. We'll meet the test, protect freedom and liberty, and we will save democracy. Others are watching. Others are listening. Others want to see how we're responding to this challenge, including China. And so the potential repercussions go well beyond Ukraine, well beyond Europe. That's why this is important. That's why it matters.
