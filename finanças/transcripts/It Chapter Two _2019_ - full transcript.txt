Anyone who wants to talk to me. It's not ... I know how it all started. How ... it started. It started ... From here. - What is this, Mike. - It's an artifact. - Early 18th century. - Where did you get that? I see, no. They gave it to me. - I stole it. - Did you steal it? - From Native Americans. - It's a bit complicated. - Yeah. - They helped me in the adventure. - Very beautiful. - He showed me something. One picture. Dan. I feel dizzy. Am I sweating? I want you to see what it is they showed me, Bill. It's about Derry. Far from thinking. They moved years ago. They are saints, healer of everything. He brought me in. They give me holy water. I started giving ... respond. All living things must be unified in law. Where it is still not yet owned. When I was watching that valley, I saw it coming. I knew one day, I want you all to see this, Mike. You have something in my drink? It's spice. Are you intoxicating me? No. It helps us to realize something. Why are you giving it to me? - So you can see. - I'm fine. I want you to see. You'll see. - I feel so unwell. - Open your eyes. They show me past stories. Show me how he appeared.

How do we do that? - Everyone says no. - I'm with you. Billy, we still have a lot to do. Okay, what do you mean You see we're all dead? Yes, because you told us something absurd. Every night after Derry's incident. I've always been can have nightmares. People in pain, they will die. So you're dreaming. Dream in life. They always dream, too. It didn't mean it Your imagination is right. I see every single one of us. You see every one what of us? I see Stanley is bound. That's his fate. Why all of us didn't see it. What makes you different? The light of death. The light of death. He's the only one exposed to the light of death on that day. We are all impressed by that, changed. Deep inside such as infections or viruses. Virus, you understand it slowly ... The virus has grown for 27 years. All this time it is growing. It just needs to be understood because ... - It's a weakness. - What are you doing, Rich. I just said what You're all thinking. I mean, Richie ... What Beverly saw it goes back to the past. That's what happened to all of us. Unless we stop it. How are we want to stop it? Chud ceremony. They're impressed. The first person to oppose it. They said. All living things are necessary according to the law of heaven. An ancient ceremony? Are you kidding me? There must be another way. This thing comes up every 27 years? Quickly light the candles and we will do it again. Wait, it's been 27 years. It wouldn't work like that. Not everyone will live The next 20 years. You know, too. If we're not inside life cycle, so ... - We must die. - It's in bad condition. Yeah, I don't want to know that bad part. I didn't say that. She said it. I understand what he's saying. And ... it's very true. That's the solution. If we all want to the ceremony was a success We need to remember. Remember what? I better show you. We don't have time. It's like a breeze. - Once it's over. - We're done. The basement. This is where we always come. After the fight. Group member's house. Yes, you remember us all. Yes, the entrance is for sure is around here. I still remember it. Are you okay? - What? - Nothing. You haven't changed. That's a good thing. I think the entrance is at... around... I found it. I'm fine! Let's go downstairs! What is this place? How are you doing? When did you build it? I'm always here. It's almost ready. I just need to prepare the wall. Need to add wood to the door. That all. Not too bad for the first time. Interesting build. What would happen if did you touch the other pillar, professor? You see, that's why safety features are a priority. Why do we need a permit? This place is a death trap, do you understand? It's still under construction, Eddie. If I get hurt You need to take responsibility. What is this? Chain of evil spirits. It's a night light. What is that. Horse bar? One day a horse came ... Oh, this is interesting. It's worth 3 dollars. So be careful. I have this one thing. Hey, Stenly did you see this? - Yeah. I can't ... - What is it? Yes, okay? Stop the excitement from playing rowing ball. Wow. That's good, You ruined her stuff. - I ruined it? - Yeah. You ruined it with your face. What? My hands won't touch below it. Oh my God. How about us still remember this place? Hey, Loser. Want to play hide and seek? Damn it, Richard. I always do that. There may be a dance. Why can't I remember this place? You want to keep this attitude until we return? Alright. I just want to make things better. I want to go later. He's really bad. Hey, everyone. What is this? Write it down "for Loser use only". Bill. What is this? So that there are no spiders creeping in your hair. Stanley, we're not afraid of spiders. I said yes. Best attempt. It's a shame. Hey, Richie. You're done in 10 minutes. What are you talking about? That swing. Rule of 10 minutes each. I don't see it a sign of the rule? - Are you kidding me? - No. But we did sign the agreement. I am entitled to the agreement. - Edge. - 10 minutes each! You're good at all this, New Kid. You think so? I'm interested in one program at the Harbor Bar. He taught everything about architecture. - That's the plan. - I'll do it. I want to do anything for out of Derry. After I graduate I want to go to Florida. Is it Florida, Mike? I do not know. That's all where I want to go. Stan, you have to go to Florida with Mike. You're in your 80's. Take your grandma once. You think we all are still friends? - When we get older. - What? Why not. Your parents are all still get in touch with your schoolmates? I mean, times have changed. We might all change. We will always be friends. I didn't think it would happen because we're getting older. Yes, Stan. Of course. You don't have to ... sad. - Old time. - Yeah. I was wondering what if I'm all grown up. Just like you think of it when you were young. The best. Hey Mike, what are we doing here? This ceremony is necessary sacrifice. Victims, You're the one, Eddie. Instant? What? Because you're small and easy to bake. I'm 5'6 "tall. Not such a sacrifice. Mike? Past stories have been embedded. But you have to dig back. Little by little. And that piece, this artifact. That's why we're here. That is your sacrifice. How to find it. We should be together looking for this artifact. I think Bill has met. Mike, where are we need to find our token. Yes, I have to say this. This is so stupid. Why do we need a token? We remember everything, save Bev Break it. I mean, we already know. Not everything. We're against it, but what happened next? Before we get to that place. Think about it. We ... don't remember, do you? There are more stories. What happened when that summer? And that blank page disappeared from the book. That's what we need to find. We need to break up. Everyone needs to find artifacts themselves. Alone. That's the most important thing. When you get it. See me at the library this night. I have to say this, Because we have to be safe. We're better are in a group. Yes, breaking up is a foolish act. We need to stay together. We were together when that summer, right? No. Not all summer. Feel this! Bill. You're useless. Stop it! We're all together when we have problems. That's why we're alive. Yes, let's just say it away. We're all going come back together again tomorrow. I don't think so. If we want to stop it. We should.

A description of what is I read it earlier. Words that are less talked about, Where ... To change something. It has the meaning behind it because Today I will become an adult male. It feels funny. Everyone has different memories. And maybe that's why we are afraid to change it. Because of the thing we are hope you can forget it. - Good morning, Mike. - How are you? Whisper us hoping to close it. It's heartbreaking. They said it was because of the fire. The nightmare we all want wake up from sleep. The memory we hope for can change it. The secret remains. Keep your heart out from hearing it. The best memory. Depictions in memory are getting away. That piece of memory too easy to forget. Maybe I don't want to forget about it. Maybe. It didn't happen today. Just forget it. Thank you, Stan. Today I should become an adult man. But I'm not there sense of difference. I know I'm useless, no matter what. It will last forever.

It's about the group, the ceremony would not have been possible without the group Do it together is the solution. Mike, he did where did he go? If you really want Pennywise there is only one place. The same place where the ceremony needs to be performed. We wouldn't like this. Die. Bill. Stop it. I started it, It's my fault why ... You're all here. This curse exists in each other. It's getting bigger at every day since I'll take you to the sewer flow. For what it is I care about finding ... Georgie. I want to go inside, I don't know what will happen. But I can't ask for you to do all this. We won't ask permission from you too. We don't alone, Bill. We won't be alone henceforward. We will always be together. So there's more want to say something? Richie said friendship always lasting. Is that so? - No one will die. - Nothing. Aren't we scared? No. Let's kill This useless clown. Let's kill This useless clown!

You don't want them to know what happened to that ancient artifact? Mikey, are you cheating on us again? No. They don't believe he can be killed. That's why it didn't work. Are you kidding me, Mike? Damn it, Mike! I need something. Whatever we remember. Whatever we believe. The light of death. Don't look! 27 years old. I'm waiting for you. Something I didn't appreciate. I miss you all!

Be quiet, Richie. For your information my mom's food smells like the smell of potpourri, you fool. Oh, no. You know how it smells the first time you smell it. We can't just keep quiet.

I'm just ready wrote the first chapter. I think I know where to go this time. - Good. - May I ask a question? Of course. Why do you think we are difficult to forget about the past. Maybe it can't be erased. Or maybe we are want it inside memory of we forget about it. Maybe. You've decided what to do? Quit Derry? I'm trapped inside in captivity for 27 years. It will definitely change many things. I think it's time to change lives. Go away, Mikey. - Oh, did you get that letter? - What letter? You will know after you see it. Hold on. I got a new letter. We all got one. This is from you. Read it. Okay. Call me, anytime. Bill. I love you, man. Me too. See you again. To the Most I know this letter look how. But this is not a suicide note.

I'm scared to be behind. Don't. Be who you are. Be proud. - Did you sleep well? - Yeah. I had a wonderful dream. And if you meet someone meaning in this life. Never let it go. Follow in your own footsteps. Whatever it is. Think about this step of life like a promise. The promise I made to you to do ... To me. With each other. A note. Good thing become a Loser.
