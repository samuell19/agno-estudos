Like camera, shoot for weddings, or get a commercial gig, or a school play, bar mitzvah. - No bar mitzvahs in North Branford. - Yeah, well, you know what I mean. Until then, I'm gonna need a car. - If I was off tomorrow, I'd go with you. - Why don't you just take the day off, come with me. - I can't! I'd have to be on call, and I'm not that kind of nurse. But I'm serious about Friday. Going to New Haven, or Eli's, I haven't decided yet. Also, I told Holly you were coming back. She's excited! She wants to fuck you, dude! - Well, that is not gonna happen. - Why, why not, what's wrong with her? - Dom fucked her. - So? So did Danny. Those guys are super horny. They'd try to fuck a bride on her way down the aisle. - How is Danny? - Oh, he's a cop now. Yeah, I know. If one more girl asks to see his gun I'm gonna shoot his dick off with it. Hey, wanna smoke? - Come on, smoke with me. You never do. - If I never do, then why do you ask? - Because I am always, always hoping. - Hoping? - Yeah! - For what? - For you to take a single puff with me. - Next time? - Next time, really? - Yeah, next time. - I don't believe you. - I don't believe me either. - Full of shit. - Alright, you know, why don't you get me a beer. Yeah, you smoke, I drink, we'll have fun. It'll be fine. - Okay, let's make a compromise here. So, I will get us both beers. - Alright. - Good?

I don't know if I could, like, see a future there. - Well, honey, let me tell you, guys are kids at heart they're entire life. - So I gotta be his mom now? - Ew, no, that's gross. God, no. But one of you guys has to be a little mature and kinda, you know, handle things a little bit. I mean, it doesn't mean he's not mature, it's just he'll be a kid three-quarters of the time. - He still plays with Hot Wheels. He's 22, it's gross! It's weird. - Oh, God. Well, just remember they don't quite grow up. Or maybe they're just playing us, huh? Maybe they want us to thing that they're kids so we can let them get away with stuff, you know? Maybe they're using reverse psychology on us. - Well, now I really don't wanna date him. - Oh, hang on, honey, give me a second. I just have to-- - What's, what's wrong? Do you want a glass of water or something? Do you want? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah, it's just, just need some air. Okay. I'll be okay. I'll be okay. Thank you. Thank you, honey. - Okay, okay. - I love you. You know I always will. - I love you, too. Yeah, of course. I know. Why are you talkin' like you? Don't talk like that. Come on, you're gonna be okay. - Okay. So when do you think you, um, take me maybe to the salon or something so I can get rid of some of this gray hair? Maybe make me feel good about myself. - Yeah. Yeah, it'll be really fun. You look beautiful, stop. You know I don't have to be at work for another hour. Wanna find Kara? - Yeah, sure. She's over here. - Really, I thought she was by Saint Francis? - No, over by the two trees, I thought. - Oh. Did you find her? - No! - I thought it was a family headstone! - No, it's just a plaque! ♪ Ooh ♪ - I said get out, get out! - You are freaking out about nothing. - About nothing? - It's nothing. - Oh, nothing, really, really? - Yes! - Explain to me how this is nothing? - Okay, so you were texting me, and then he texted me, and then you texted me, and I got confused about-- - That is such a-- - No, it is not! - For this! - Yes, I was. - You knew exactly what you were doing. Get the fuck out. - Tommy. Fuck. - Hi, Tommy, I really need you to call me. I feel like I did not articulate myself earlier. I, I am, I am so sorry, I didn't mean to. I feel terrible. I understand why you're mad, but just call me back, okay? - We have new information on that crash in North Branford from last night. This happened at the intersection between Route 80 and Twin Lakes Road. The driver has been identified as 22 year old Kara Gavin of Northford. A vigil will be held tomorrow at 7 pm at. - I can't find her anywhere. - It's alright, neither can I. Let's just go. - No, I feel awful. - It's okay, Tommy. We can come back. - She's gonna get so mad at me. - No, she won't. She's knows you're here. It's alright, Tommy. - It's there like, fucking, a directory, or someone we can talk to about this? - We can't keep going back and forth. - It's not alphabetical. I just can't fucking find her! - Okay, hey, whoa. Listen, you got an interview at three, I gotta go to work, we have our shit, okay? Let's just go. - Yeah. Yeah, why don't you take me back to my car, and come back on my own. - Tommy, no, don't. No, come on. Let's just go, alright? - Oh, God. This place is so small, she could be, she could be right there, you know? - Tommy, I know. I know. - She could be right there. - Tommy, let's just go. Alright? - Yeah, yeah, okay, let's go. - It's okay. Want Dunkin'? I'll buy. - Yeah, sure. Hello? - Tommy, it's Angela. - Oh, hey. - Hey. I don't mean to bother you, but my cousin said that you came in looking for me the other day. - Oh, um, yeah. I was just, you know, at the restaurant, and wanted to say hi. - Oh, okay. I was just wondering, making sure you're okay. - Yeah. No, I'm more or less fine. I had a job interview. - Oh, cool, how'd it go? - I don't know yet. - What job? - Technical director for an arts college. - Oh, that's nice. I hope you get it. Listen, I was just wondering if anytime this week you wanna grab dinner or a drink or something. Not like a date, just I wanna see you, and catch up more. - Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. I'm kind of in for the night right now, but, um. - Do you like Supreme? - Supreme Seafood? Yeah. I haven't been there in a while. Nah, that sounds great. - Okay, great. Four o'clock? - Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'd really like that. - Me too. Okay, great. Well, I'll see you then. Oh, you can text me, by the way. - Yeah, about that. How did you get my number? - I've had it. - Right. Yeah, I'm, sorry, I switched phones. - It's okay. Okay, well, have a good night. I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah, four o'clock. - Okay, bye. - You know when you watch the Titanic high you root for Cal. - You're out of your mind. Oh my God. - It's true. - These fucking bullfrogs! - Hey! - Jesus! - What the fuck are you doing? - Get in. I almost died. - You guys smell like a dorm room in here. - Why, why are you in the car? - My dad doesn't like me to smoke in the house. - He's not home. - He's not? - How high are you? - Pretty high. I thought he was in the house. - No, I was in the house. - Well, who the fuck were you talking to? - I was on the phone. - Then where is he? - He's at the basketball game. The Branford basketball game. - Oh, shit, do you wanna go? - No! - That'd be so funny. Imagine us walking in there? - Oh, yeah, that'd be hilarious. - It'd be the best basketball game. - Anyway, what are you doing tonight? - Nothing. - Come hang with us. - Yeah, sure, we'll do it. - Why don't you smoke? - I get paranoid. - No, he doesn't, it makes him sad. - That's not true, I just-- - Why? - 'Cause Kara used to smoke, and he didn't like it. She was a bigger stoner than was. - Huh. - Yeah. - Oh. That's a pretty big stoner. - Oh, yeah. You remember, do you remember when she almost hit something in her RAV. Oh my God! - Yeah. - It was the best night. We were all coming home from some party or something, I don't remember. And so we all pile in her new RAV, 'cause it could fit all of us, and she turns the corner onto our street and we just hear this bump and then the , and we were like, oh my God. We all rushed out of the car. It was like that movie. And so my brother walks around to the tire, and he goes, oh my God. And we go, what, what what? He goes, we hit a fucking boot! - Yeah, yeah, it was pretty stupid. - It was the, it was the best night. Oh, I'm pretty high. You guys wanna go inside? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Alright. I'm movin' out. - Do it. - Wait, what? - Do it. - Do it. - Wow, was not expecting that. - What were you expecting? - I don't know, some big, like, no, don't do it! You can't afford it, we'll miss you. Aren't you guys gonna miss me? - You said moving out, not moving. - Oh. - Do you wanna move in with me? Cheaper. I don't have an extra room, but. - No, it's okay. I just... It's just, like,. It just sucks. My dad probably doesn't even want me here. - Hey, don't say that, that's not true. - Whatever. - She's passed out again. - Oh, yeah? - Do you think she's really gonna move out? - Yeah, probably. - What about you? You can't live here forever. - I don't plan on staying here too long. I'll figure it out once I, you know, get a job. But if I don't, it's down to Delray Beach with my parents. - That would be awesome! - For you. - What are you working on? - Ah, it's nothing really. Found some old videos, just looking through them. - Geez, you look the same. - Thanks. - Oh, pink was Kara's favorite color. Sorry. - For what? - Nothing. - Okay, alright, check this out. We used to put cups in the sand down on Madison Beach, and we would throw ping pong balls against the wind, try to hook 'em back into the cup. Called it beach pong. It's fuckin' impossible, I only got it once. - Were you guys, like, drunk all day there? - When we were a little older, yeah, pretty much. But it was even better when we were teenagers. You know, none of us had phones or anything to be distracted by. Well, I mean, you know, we had the Nextels. - Oh my God, I remember those. - Yeah. - Those walkie talkie phones. - That's the one. Shit. - What? - It's gonna kick off. - What? - Yeah, there it goes. - What happened? - Nothing, I just got too much shit in here. Gotta get it cleaned out. - Take it to P.C. Richard. - No, no, it'll be okay for a little. It'll turn back on. It's just the fun part is seeing if I lost anything. - Can I kiss you? - Um, no. - I love you guys, all of you. Do you want another beer? - No, no, I'm good. - Okay, I'm gonna go to bed. - Oh, hey, do you need clothes or anything? - I brought my own this time. - Cool. - Unless you want me to get naked in front of you again. - That's not what I meant. - I'm fucking with you. Good night. - Good night, Holly. - How long were you waiting? - I just got here. - Okay. What's up? I remember that shirt. - Yeah, it's a classic. - You always had good shirts. - Hey folks, how are yous? Can I get you something to drink? - Can I get a Coke? - A Coke. - Just a water, please. - And a water, sure. - Thank you. - Oh, I have been non-stop today. What were you up to? - Absolutely nothing. It was fantastic. - Oh, lucky you. I took Joey to school, went to get new glasses because I broke the shit out of my old ones that I loved. - There you go, folks. - Thank you. - Oh, thank you. - Would you like to order right now? - Yeah, can I get the lobster roll, please. - The lobster roll? - Yeah. - Can I get the clam strips with extra tartar on the side? - Extra tartar, would you like french fries with it, too? - Oh, yeah, those Cajun fries. - Cajun fries, sure, okay. - Thank you. - Thanks. Let me see your glasses. - They're all right. My old ones were adorable. But they do the job though. - I like 'em. - Thank you. - So, what happened to your mom. You know, I heard she left. - She went to California. - Your dad okay? I don't wanna ask. - No, it's fine. He's alright. Trying to date again. - Did you see it coming? - No. My dad helped her get a job with his friend. Three months later she was fucking that friend, and six months later she wanted a divorce. Now she's in California with him. - Still talk to her? - All the time. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. But, no more me. How are you? Are you okay? - Yeah. - Listen, I know you don't wanna talk about it. You probably were worried that I was gonna bring it up. But just. - Ang, you don't gotta say, it's fine. - Just listen, just listen, please. I don't know, this whole time, I thought after seeing you today that I would be thinking, you know, you're not you, and it's sad or whatever. But I was wrong, no, you're still you! And I know that you're not the kind of person that. - It's okay. - No, Tommy, I know she was horrible. I know she treated you like shit! - Ang, it wasn't that bad. - And you didn't deserve that. - It's not that bad. - Everybody talks about her like she's some fucking angel now, and you can't even talk about how fucked up she was to you because that would be rude. - We were in college, that shit happens all the time. - You never told anyone, you only told me, and then you move. - It's not. - And I couldn't, I. - That kind of shit just happens. It's fine. - I want. - I'm fine, Ang. - I worried. And I missed you. - What do you want me to say? - You don't have to say anything, Tommy. You just have no reason to feel guilty now that she's gone. - It's stupid. - It's horrible for everyone, but you gotta find some way. - No, you don't get it. You don't get it. - Tommy, I do! - No, no, no, no one, no one gets it. You don't, you don't know. Fuck, nevermind, no. - Talk to me. What? - When she died. - Hey. - I went with her, you know? Just... Um, thanks for dinner, you know? - No, I owe you. You didn't have to pay. - Sure, I did. Anytime. Let's just, um, let's not talk about that, okay? - Yeah, okay. - Just. - I'm sorry I brought it up. - It's fine, it's fine. - Hey, do you wanna do this again sometime. Not cry together. Everything but that. I don't know, grab dinner, drinks. You could come over. - Yeah, actually, I'd really like that. - Okay. I'm sorry I brought it up. - No, it's alright. Let's just, let's just not talk about it again. - Yeah, okay.
