Admirers, upholders and epicures of the comedian art... Be patient a little longer and everything will turn out fine. Because we will perform for you in a purely artistic way... ...a great journey where you will meet your fortune... I am the brave knight Philoden And I come to your country of Naples... For many tournaments and feasts Squire, open the gate of the Royal castle. High-bred foreigner, doth thou not know... How deep in sorrow is our king? For the sake of his excellent daughter Princess Beatrix... For the ninth day now, the whole city is covered with black, English canvas... Oh, recruit me right away, so I could use all of... My skills and braveness to solve all the mysteries... and to save the divine princess Beatrix from all bedstraw... and to make her my dear wife. Move, honey. I will go... Even if it should mean my doom. Well, follow thy determination then. If thou art smart enough... to fight against all adversities. Your Majesties, The King, The Queen I am well aware of the enormous agony which engulfs the country of Naples It engulfs so much that all the country seems like a gulf now. Clear off, you disgusting shrimp and fool. This isn't the time for your silly jokes and clowning. And thou, Brave and fearless knight, Philoden Thou must know... What's wrong with the hand? That our Princess disappears each night... despite the guarding of her bedroom door. But if thou wilt risk thy head and release some perfidious persons from diabolic plots... Thou canst believe... The Princess and even half of the Royal treasury will belong to thee. See, how daring the comedian rabble is. Exorbitant, your Excellency. Nothing but insults to Grand Duke's court. We will make a thorough investigation. Those are riff-raff, Hetman. Just insolent riff-raff. I'm out of roses... But if I could invite the damsel to that pub for something. The damsel wouldn't refuse. But she's not on her own. Dad, Yoseph, uncle This man would like to invite us to the pub for something. For a dinner! High-bred man Fortune or misfortune - mere illusions. An actor can't tell today about tomorrow. The life of a comedian... It's nothing but blind chance. In other words, dear friend... We find your invitation more than kind. Well... I'm no higher bred than you, better leave it behind. I am an errant student. My blood needs drifting as well as yours. But when a banquet, then in a royal way. I'll be your debtor forever, my friend. Ladies and gentlemen, to the banquet, please. I am Martin. I am called Tontchka. Hold on, riff-raff. Go to another house. Last time, you paid with a handful of moth-eaten rags. You can only dream of a royal banquet, I'll give you not even a crust. Oh no, all the precious company will be my guest. Woodcocks, pheasant, ducks, even a young goose will be OK. Oh, that's something quite different. Come on in, dear gentleman. Didn't our Princess wave to you? The beer is quite excellent. And the skin of the geese is just being roasted and getting crispy. Let your hurdy-gurdy relax. We will sing ourselves. Better help us eating and drinking. Well, your invitation is cordial... Wine for the gentlemen, please. Here's to... Here's to long living, good elder. Enjoy your meal, friends, and here's to health. Well... I will play one song after all. In the name of Grand Duke... Hang this. Didn't you hear, hang this. Isn't that the same paper as last week? Check this out! Let all dependants of His Grand Duke's Majesty know: Capable young men devoted to the Royal lineage are being sought... For a special service. An exuberant reward. The possibility of making a proposal to the Princess. Present yourselves any time to the hetman of the guards. Haven't they enough soldiers? Soldiers! It shows that you've come from far away. Weird things take place in our Grand Duchy, high-bred sir. Even these honorable actors act it out, as you can see. The Princess is involved. All kind of beggars have tried to get the royal reward. 8 of them have disappeared so far, so they're seeking others. I didn't see much of your play, Tontchka. Never mind, dear friend... Tontchka... Yoseph, keep eating. We are willing to perform the main part of the play. Come, my beloved... Royal daughter Beatrix, come up. Couldst thou let us know, which wicked man or arch-demon tricked and impounded thy tender soul? My dearest royal father My dearest royal father and daddy. Each night I must... lodge god knows where - Dance... - Go back. Take part in all kinds of parties and balls. But I cannot mention the cause of all that... Not even a single word. Otherwise wicked things would come to pass And that would mean... Bloodshed and death for... All of us. And now a drink for me. Who wants can figure it out. Keep this for the fair. I am a decent citizen and an inn-keeper. Here with the drink, c'mon. Drink on, my friends. The gentleman will pay, now? Oh, pay. This is for wine and beer. This is for the barbecue. And this... This... ...is the tip. Dear publican, remember... No student ever became poorer because of a tip. Smart cookie! I believed he was a great nobleman, and he's only a student! Punk! vagabond!! Help me! I've been swindled. I'm stony broke! Help me! Scoundrels. Help! Guards! Burglars and murderers! Send them to the gallows! Help! Help me! So insulting the Grand Duke's majesty isn't enough for these artists. I've been swindled, swindled. Now they even swindle the inn-keeper. Let's see. You will have to accompany me. I invited them and I will pay later but... You should hang him! Take this, Martin. It's for your invitation. Is this really justice? Hey, not so fast! Tontchka, pay! 6 coppers? I'm coming... Hey! Lemme out! Lemme out! Open the door! Guards! Well! Madam, There's no help, I must ask thee for a dance. We must entertain the gentry. As if I was a royal fool... Speaking of which, where is that person? Well... Music. Mademoiselle It's not my fault that everyone avoids being your suitor like the plague. No one is keen to loose their head. Adriana, You should open your heart at least to your mother. And the court astrologer has been away for a month now. Master of alchemy, astrology as well as of white and black magic... The court physicist, an inventor and a card interpreter. His excellency, Count Aldobrandini. He is the only one who could help us. You're right, Grand Duke. What's going on? Martin, You have escaped? I didn't feel well there. Also, I missed something. - Freedom? - That also. - And you as well. - A lot? - A lot. You are acquainted with the Princess? No, I saw her only once. She is beautiful, isn't she? Martin Tontchka I'll give you the heart of the biggest bell. Would you like it? I don't believe you, two-faced. You give out hearts as easily as roses. I'm not lying... You'll see. Stop it, I believe you - Forever? - And you? This has a magic power. As long as you wear it, you'll never forget about me. - And it will always protect you. - Even from the Hetman? I know... Out of love... Dear admirers... Upholders- Stop it Yoseph And epicures of... The comedian art- Yoseph, go to the cabin. Be patient a little longer and everything will turn out fine. Because we will perform for you... in a purely artistic way... The story of unfortunate love... and a cruel adversity... Which was experienced by... The perfect and comely knight, Philoden. And an overly-sweet princess Beatrix In the country of Naples. But before that Ladies and Gentlemen... I'm sorry, miss. While our comedians are getting ready So that they are tastefully attired, we will sing for you a song... Which springing from the heart... Affects only pure feelings. Well, student, so much for the performance. Guards! Just, come... Get him! Martin He's disappeared. We can't find him. He's disappeared. Imprison them all! What's all this mess? Daddy! Daddy! We've only done a play. Yoseph Well, Councillor of Police, this gang of comedians will have to do. Of course. Hiding an escaped criminal and so on and so on... Also that play of theirs is a very transparent way to... Step aside! High-bred gentleman, What's wrong? We didn't do anything! High-bred gentleman... We'll take all of you! Even this high-bred miss. Guards, come on. Hey, Hetman! I read your edict and I volunteer for the service. But you must release the actors. Well... We've no need of any comedy in prison just yet. We will see. Martin, you can't mean it! - Not one of those eight came back. - I will, Tontchka. - The Grand Duke will surely be kind-hearted then. - Go. - No! Move! They stand here like this every single day. Unbelievable. None of those eight youngsters is likely to return. You will surely be more lucky, student. Martin You don't lack courage. But neither did those before. I have no choice, Your Majesty. I have debts, I am an escapee. I would be imprisoned again. Not only me, I'm afraid. I know, You feasted actors. That thing is a disaster for the whole Grand Duchy. The Princess should be married. But no one longs for her- You're forgetting me, Grand Duke. Come to the park, to the summer-house. The Grand Duchy will lack an heir to the throne. All right. I await you this evening, at eight. For dinner. Then you will guard the Princess. Perhaps... Your Grand Duke's majesty You should be more careful... - With presents like this. - Thank you Step inside. The court astrologer... Count Aldobrandini. He is the owner of this summer-house. I know, you're not stupid nor a coward. I know, you escaped from prison... with that coat and even without it. But here, you risk your life. You know why. My friends would suffer for my sins. Now, what do you want to tell me? I want to speak about the Princess. She used to love dances and garden parties. The Grand Duke needn't worry about the lack of her suitors then. He and the Count had daring intentions. They found the Grand Duchy too small. They longed for an enormous army. They prepared inventions that would bewitch the world. But the main item was money. A fabled fortune gained by mysterious experiments. A man who is able to promise all this... and to flatter the Governor's vanity as well as Aldobrandini... can even think of marrying the Governor's daughter. But the Princess could never stand the Count. I feared for her. The astrologer tricked the Grand Duke and lied to him. Later he... focused on the Princess. Your Highness... Finally you should know your future. That is also the wish of your high-bred father. Only a single, tiny drop of... Blood will do. May I? I can see your future. It's splendid... Shining like diamonds. You are accompanying your husband... Towering with him over human wretchedness. I can... Read here your new... Proud and noble name. What name? Adriana Aldobrandini. Don't defend yourself. This power is stronger than your will. This power is capable of destroying the whole palace with one word. Of the whole Grand Duchy only smoke and rosemary would remain. Whoever opposes me will die. Do you resign yourself forever and ever to my endless power? I resign. Since then, the Princess seems in another world. It has broken everyone's heart. And no one but you knows it's all the astrologer's fault... Only a day later, he went on one of his overseas journeys. There's no point in me explaining it all. Who would believe a court fool with a clown's cap? And... I could do even more wrong by that. It seemed the astrologer's threats were really meant. So I am the ninth one. There's not much hope left. A bit yet.. You have that coat and... - I will accompany you. - You? Me. If the Princess only was involved... Her father would have forced her after all. In the interests of state... I'd love to know the whole truth. And to help the Princess. When she was a kid... She used to like me... My life isn't important any more. I can't wait any longer... And... Somehow I feel that you could be the one. - All right? - All right. Martin the student. Poor thing. Such a handsome, young man. No one knows about me. Just come, come, Fuksa. Let's go to the warm. Stay here. Yoseph, I worry about him. Why didn't he stay with us? They'd have released us from the prison anyway. If only we could make our living... All four of us. What's up? - The hand is broken. - The thumb again. I'll repair it. He could sing along with you. People liked it. We've been expelled just the same. Dear Beatrix, love will release you... When we come to another country. Nothing will happen to Martin. He will solve the mystery after all. And he will marry the princess. I know that. Why are you crying? To the table, gentlemen. Dinner is served. Fool... Nothing but a croaker. We have bad luck. No savior today. ...And his excellency is waiting. Silence. Carefully. Jump. A fool! - Finally a proper hero. - A dull brain. His Excellency needs his heart not his wit. Let me out. Such paleness becomes her. She is as beautiful as a funeral maid. She shines like an autumn crocus in the moonlight. Count Aldobrandini can't wait. I hope your journey was pleasant, Princess. Let us dance. - As you wish, Count. - Only the modest wish of a groom-to-be. No one? One is here, your Excellency, but... Finally a ninth one. Even fools act like heroes these days. A heartlet. Wake up, Princess. I order you, wake up. Now. Fool! Where am I? Your Majesty, I dared... a ball. - The day before our wedding. - No! My father will never have me married against my will. He will never let it happen. The Grand Duke? I don't give a damn about him. Anyway you will never return there. Now... I have the ninth heart. I will have the potion again... Which will return to me life... and youth. Which will give me power. Over the people and even over the underworld. Dear Princess, this is... A Kingdom above all the Kingdoms in the world. See, fool? There's only one missing. - And where are...? - The owners of those hearts? You needn't worry about that. Fool. Finally. An extract from nine hearts. Princess This is a distillate... gained in Pharaohs' crypts. Without it I would be... for 300 years now... Dead. Whenever I feel... My energy weaken only a droplet will do The extract and... The distillate... Make together an elixir. And the fool? - Is there no way to help them? - Them? Only the potion could give them back their lives. But it has my seal on it. Their time... is over. Come, Princess. Before I start the work... I will show you... The way that time works. Time which I control. This is the hall of underworld time. Princess. Each cog of the circle here... stands not for a second but for a whole day. Within only an hour here you would grow years and years older. And if I would let fall... each grain of sand... The ninth heart, poor fool. It could have been mine. Fool Martin Come on out of... here. Go. Princess... They won't get out alive. Those nine hearts belong to me! Dogs! We have to get out. Out! This way. There... Come on. This one is mine. We've passed through here already. Oh my god. Let's separate. Or we'll never find the way out. There must be an exit somewhere. The four of you to the right, the rest to the left... come on, move. The hall of time. Come on back. But there was a gate here before... And only a second means a day here. Maybe he will return after all. Even with the Princess. In a few days we'll reach a town. You know he won't return, Yoseph. Isn't it a whole year now? Well... Dear admirers, upholders and epicures... Of the comedian art. We will perform for you a story of a unfortunate love... and cruel adversity. Which was experienced by A perfect knight, Philoden and an overly-sweet maiden... The Princess Beatrix. In the country of Naples. The fifth minute... A minute more and a year will be gone. Martin Martin! Martin... An exit! Look! Princess Princess You are beautiful. Daddy! Adriana! I can't believe... My child. Oh look at you. - So you have succeeded. - Not by myself. Oh yes, great work, fool. I designate you to be the main court fool for life. with license to wear the golden chain. I know... With jingle bells. And as for you, student... Adriana... Will you sue for the Princess? - Your Majesty... - Of course he will, you have promised. But before all, I must change. When will the espousal party start? I'll give orders right away. We will call for the dress-makers. Princess To love beyond the marble tomb. I have a surprise for you. Martin The groom of my daughter. The Count Merlini. Our new court astrologer. You are not a very amusing man, Mr. Martin. You haven't even danced with me yet, Your Highness. - Aren't we celebrating the espousal? - Oh, the espousal. But I am tired now. Besides, the Count has just invited me for a ride You and I will have fun enough later. And... There are lots of other dancing girls here. The Countess Clara. The Marquise Charlotta. Or the Baroness Amelia there. One foolish dream is fading away. Youngster... The Grand Duke was never serious about his offer. The state's interests and so on. For you he will give money. I lost something. Somebody perhaps. But no. You didn't. Does one year really mean something? Well, congratulations, student. His majesty talked about you... in a most laudatory way. Where are the actors? Sir, they aren't suitable company for you now. Dear admirers... Upholders... And epicures of the comedian art. Just come in, comely maiden. Don't be shy. Be patient a little longer... And everything will turn out fine. Because... we will perform for you... In a purely artistic way the story... Of an unfortunate love... and a cruel adversity... Which was experienced in the country of Naples... By the perfect knight Philoden and an overly-sweet maiden... The Princess Beatrix. Tontchka! Martin Martin Martin Children... The play... begins...
