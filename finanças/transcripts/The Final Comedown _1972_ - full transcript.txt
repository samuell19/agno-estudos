Move back. >> I wonder if Johnny's all right. >> What? >> She asked if Johnny Johnson's all right. >> I hope the son of a bitch is dead. >> Why don't you douche out your mind, that white ego? >> John -- >> That was a bitch! Now, who are you that we should spend all of our time hating? You and the rest of those zombies runnin' around, talkin' about you all dropped out. They don't educate you in those schools, baby. They condition you -- that's their bag -- and then feed you right to their system to keep the machinery going. >> Well, there's a lot -- >> You and your brother and the rest of you carrying those fucking peace signs and talking that two-sided trash and still takin' your parents' money. >> There are blacks doing the same thing. >> What? Now, let me lay something on you, chick. By time you hit 30, you gonna drop back in. Yeah, 'cause you didn't do nothing but talk that brotherhood love and peace. You didn't change nothin', which means work and making that talk, talk, talk happen. But we can't drop into nothin' 'cause we never had nothin' to drop out of. >> Everything you say, I -- >> Always that same bullshit about how you can't deal with pickin' up the gun. >> That's not my trip. >> And you think it's mine? >> I don't know. Johnny, what I mean is, I just don't see how that solves anything. >> It's not your trip, remember? >> But just look what it's doing to you. >> Fuck you! >> Every day, you just get more and more bitter. >> Bitter, baby? I'm not bitter. I was bitter 350 years ago. I'm violent. You hear me, God damn it? Violent! They gonna kill you sure as shit, and all you're gonna have is that peace sign in your hand. [ Water running ] >> Hey, I can understand, but I am not in your skin. [ Water turns off ] Johnny... I live in another world. I would like to know. >> You'd like to know? One day. If you lived in my skin one day, you'd blow your fucking brains out. You'd like to know. >> Could I ever understand? >> Yeah. Turn black Monday morning.

Shit! >> Oh, Johnny. Johnny, don't talk. >> Yeah, man. You bleedin' like hell. >> Doctor will be here in a little while. >> No, no. Find Mama. Tell her -- Tell her stay away, stay home. [ Gunshots ] >> She should know what we gotta do, understand why we're here. >> She probably knows. >> No, man. She's -- She's no good in that way. That's all you ever talk about, Mama. >> I talk about who pays me when I work and who pays your daddy when he works. Trouble with you young folks today is -- >> The trouble is the white man has a rotten society. >> The white man! >> But you don't wanna see that. >> I understand food and shelter. >> A dog has that, mama. A dog. >> All day I'm working, slavin' for y'all. >> Yes, mama. >> I ain't got time to be blamin' white folks for all of my troubles. >> [ Mutters ] The man whose house you clean every day -- does his wife work and slave, too? Does his Mama? You got to know one thing, Mama. We want these murdering dogs to be human and let us live like human beings. [ Water running ] >> White folks have always helped us. Nobody gives you nothin' for nothin', son. They know what's right and what ain't. >> Yeah. I'm sure of that. >> Mama, how can they do to us what they've done and still doin' and -- and know right from wrong? >> Them crazy niggers you hangin' out with, always shootin' each other and gettin' shot up by the police. >> You ever ask yourself why, why the police are always shootin' us down and why we hate one another? >> Because you -- >> We live in the same country as the white boys. They aren't taught to hate themselves like we are. >> Nobody ever taught me to hate. >> But you do. Mama, listen to the way you talk about black people. >> I say what I feel, that's all. >> Mama, we believe ourselves inferior. The cops believe we're inferior. Black animals -- that's why they shoot us down, those damn pig-faced sons of -- >> Shut up! [ Voice breaking ] Just shut up. Am I inferior, too, that you can use words like that in my house? >> [ Sighs heavily ] Mama, Mama... [ Vehicle departing ] We distrust what is black in our mind and body. Man, oh, man. And these things make up the whole of our being. [ Door closes ] >> What's goin' on? [ Water running ] You fussin' at your mother again? [ Gunshots ] >> Them other brothers are burning now. I can feel it. >> If them white boys would have done what they should have... >> Billy Joe warned you, Johnny -- just talk. >> [ Exhales sharply ] ** >> All right, then. Okay, we in our basement, you in yours, reciting the declaration. >> Good, good, good. And the pigs will say illegal assembly, and they'll attack us. >> We fight back, just a little, enough to lead them to a midpoint, then make 'em follow us uptown. You're sure that they'll follow? >> They'll follow, man. If you all are not there, they'll force us into a corner. >> We'll be there. >> Good. Newspapers will do the rest. ** ** [ Vehicles passing ] >> Hey, look... we gotta get it together and take it to the white part of the city. My folks have to see it. >> All right, man. >> Look, we gotta do it. If you do it, it's no good. >> All right. We bring it to them or bring them to it. >> All right. >> Now, you all let out on us, we gonna be in there by ourselves. >> We'll be there. >> The pigs will be waiting to hit us the minute we get together. We begin at home, then bring it together. >> We get together, recite, but we don't start. >> All right. You scared, ain't you? >> Yes. So are you, man. >> Yeah, but the motherfucker won't let me breathe. [ Funky music plays ] [ Indistinct conversations ] >> Nobody can stop us, not now. >> [ Breathing heavily ] We gotta keep pushing, and we'll win. And we... [ Gasps ] >> Cool it, man. >> And we'll win. [ Gunshots ] Ahh. [ Gunshots continue ] [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Vehicle approaching ] >> Wow, what are you doing around here so early today? >> Dropping something off at Billy Joe's. [ Vehicles passing ] >> Thank you, sir. Didn't make near $5 today. Ah, well. Make it up on the weekend. ** [ Engine starts ] Billy Joe and them -- they're gonna get you in a whole heap of trouble. >> We ain't doin' nothin' to nobody. >> [ Scoffs ] Yeah, I know. You're just protecting yourselves. Sure. You gonna get your ass back in school to get that piece of paper. >> What is that gonna do? They ask Reverend King's I.Q. or Kennedy's I.Q. before they ripped them off? >> I'm talkin' about you. >> Yeah. [ Scoffs ] "Don't kill this one. He's an intelligent man." >> Look, all I'm sayin' is that you gettin' locked up or killed ain't gonna change nothin'. >> Hey, a lot of us gonna die. >> For what? For nothin'? >> For me, me! I'm somethin'! >> For you. You get locked up, you can't help nothin'. >> What if I'm right? What if I'm right when they lock me up? >> I can't protect you. I -- I can't protect you. All right, what do you want me to say? That ain't nothin' changed in 300 years? All right, I'm sayin' it. How do you think I feel knowin' it? For 24 hours a day, I gotta live with it. What's the use of gettin' killed? ** [ Gunshots ] >> I'm scared, Luanna. >> You're the leader, Johnny. You ain't scared of nothin'. Everybody knows that. >> You don't know. You don't know. >> I know. I've known you for 3 years. >> In my mother's house... I'm nothing. [ Gunshots continue ] >> Shh. >> She half-killed my father. She made a nigger out of him with that white man's god. [ Breathing raggedly ] [ Jazzy music plays ] >> Okay, we'll start with the head rolls to the right. Ready? And down... to the right, to the back... to the left, to the down... to the right, to the back, to the left. Arms up to the side. Right foot forward. Let's go down and touch the toes and come up and take a big breath. And let's put our left foot out. ** Put the left foot forward, over. And take a big breath. >> Hey, man, come on. >> Fifth position jumps. Ready? Jump, jump, jump, up, up, up. >> Come on. >> Jump, jump, jump, up, up, up, up, high, high, high. >> Hey! >> [ Laughs ] >> Hey, what's happenin', man? >> What's goin' on, my brother? >> What's goin' on, bro? >> It's happenin'. >> Right on. Mm-hmm. >> You're the man. >> Brothers. [ Exhales sharply ] Brothers New York, Chicago, Detroit. These brothers are Los Angeles. I understand you're full of leadership qualities, but you don't want to lead. Would you run that down for me? >> I'm just not there, man. >> Well, that's cool. The New York brothers -- they wanna -- they feel that they should, well, put more stress on legal action instead of the anti-pig tactics. >> Yeah, well, with the pigs, we ain't got no choice. They won't get up off our asses. And that legal shit? Well, it's just that for us. >> Yeah, you know, the brother's right, so there's no controversy. >> The legal trip to us means submit to conquer. Ain't no man in his right man goin' for that shit. >> Right on, brother. >> Mm. >> Right. >> Well, the New York brothers -- they wanna tie the man up with his own legal strings. >> Mm-hmm. >> How do you feel about that? Oh, wow. >> And put your leg way up in the air. Up, up, up, up, up, up! >> Black thighs? Man, the brothers are dyin' in the streets. Now, you ain't got no time for that shit. >> Maybe you don't, but I do. >> Ready? Jump, jump, jump... >> Hey, man, don't let the meeting degenerate into the subject of sex. >> You asked me about leading. Lead what? A bunch of dead men? >> Oh, man. >> Man, back off. >> We call each other "brother." What does that mean? "Brother, what's happenin'?" "Nothin', man." "Brother, how you makin' it?" "Steady, fightin' the man." That's the dialogue of dead men. Here we are, continually shooting each other down. That's what the pigs want -- for us to keep ourselves divided instead of seeing and doing what we can for the young brothers and sisters coming behind us. We are here smothering each other, brothers killing brothers. This has gotta stop. It's only a matter of time before we go. We go either dying of pneumonia in some cold building or dying of an overdose of shit or wine in a gutter or they shoot us down in the street. All of that is immaterial. If we have to die, then let it be so that the language of the young brothers and sisters coming behind us can be the dialogue of living men. >> To your right, to the back, to your left. Okay, put right foot out. >> I think we are all acquainted with the problem. >> Yeah. >> Right. >> It's the solution that we're after. >> We've got to take the shit off the street corners and make it applicable. Nothing is gonna change till them white people see their kids shot down like animals. >> Well, that's good. I mean, I can dig that. >> That's where it's at, man. >> You're sincere. But the contradictions are obvious. You see, you don't understand the dynamics of the culture that you live in. >> Contradiction? >> You are judging your brothers and sisters by a society that has suppressed them. And upon that judgment, you want to be separated. And finally, you don't wanna lead simply because you don't think they're worthy of you. Like you said, they are dead men. >> Now, wait a minute, man. I didn't say -- >> Hey, man, let him finish. >> Right. >> Now, there are social, political and economic pitfalls that clearly explain our people's position. Now, you said they're dead men, huh? Well, they are more alive than you are right now. >> Right on. >> Right on. >> Dig it. >> Now, you talkin' about goin' out and shootin' down some white kids like animals, huh? Do you know how that's gonna read in the newspaper headlines? "White radicals shot in ghetto riot," period. >> It all depends on how you set it up. >> Listen to me! Listen to me. You are living in a tormented cultural wasteland. You are a black man. And you are not dead. And neither are the rest of us. You are alive. And if you know... you must teach. And if you know... you must lead. There are many brothers and sisters outside who need you, and if you can't see that... then you have deceived yourself. >> Ready, and down, right... back, left, down. And arms up to the side. Right foot forward.

You're pretty uptight. I don't do nothin'. I can't get a job. Used up, chewed up, too old. Oh, they don't -- They can't use me anymore. >> That's what happens. >> Wow. Look at that, will ya? Big. Big, ain't it? Tombstones of a super-technical country. I don't belong here anymore. I ain't got what they need. >> Ah, you pay one way or the other. >> You're next, you know, you and others like you. >> Not if I can help it. >> Uh, you can let me off at that corner there. >> Right on.

We have to think about what we wanna do and how to get it past the white man. We don't live life. We survive through it. We have to run a conscious game on the man... 24 hours a day. [ Gunshots ] [ Dramatic music playing ] [ Gunshots continues ] >> Doc, you black, ain't you? >> My skin's black, if that's what you mean. >> I mean what are you doin' for your people, Mr. Doctor Smalls? >> A rat bit a child this morning. I treated her. They couldn't pay me, but I treated her. >> A rat? >> If they could, would you take it? >> Of course. >> Well, maybe you're human after all. >> Quite. And a little bit older than you, so -- [ Gunshots continue ] >> That's a boy. Got your cereal okay? [ Indistinct conversations ] >> Oh, shit! Mnh! >> Cussing won't help. Run cold water on it. Damn it, woman, come on. [ Indistinct conversations ] >> Here you are. >> Theon, you late again. You late one more time, I'm-a kick your ass. Now, you believe that? >> Ain't nobody gonna kick my ass. >> [ Chuckles ] Right on, blood. Come on, now. Give me five. Now go on in there. [ Chuckles ] [ Vehicle approaching ] [ Engine shuts off ] Don't turn around. The pigs are behind you. >> What them bastards want, man? >> I know what they gonna get. >> I got a job interview, man. I better go. >> Poor Johnny tryin' to be a good American. >> That's what a college education does for ya. >> He's gonna find out. [ Keys clacking ] >> You've done extremely well on all our tests, Mr. Johnson. The job is yours. >> Thanks. When do I start? >> Monday. We've got an excellent insurance plan for all of our employees, plus Blue Cross and Blue Shield. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. [ Intercom buzzes ] Yes? Now? Uh... Yes. Yes, sir. Please excuse me a moment. [ Keys clacking ] I'm sorry... but the job is not available. I'm sure a young man with your abilities won't have any trouble finding a job in a large city. I know. [ Dramatic music plays ] >> Hey, hey, you sold-out pig! >> Pig! >> Why don't you go on down there, you pig bastard! [ Indistinct shouting ] >> Pig bastard! >> How's Johnny? >> When's the doctor coming, Joe? >> I got him. Found him in a house hiding. Come on, Doc! A little dirt ain't gonna hurt you. >> Man, this ain't no time to be jivin'. [ Gunshots ] >> L-Look, I-I-I don't know what I can do here. >> Motherfucker, you better think of somethin' quick. >> [ Moaning lightly ] >> You hear the news? >> Yeah, it's happening all over. >> They rushed me so quick, I-I just stuffed what I could in my bag. Hey, that's a bad wound. >> [ Moaning ] [ Gunshots ] >> Be cool, man, please. >> [ Gasping ] [ Groaning ] >> Police do this? ** [ Engine backfires, shuts off ] >> Up. >> Here we are, boy. [ Car door slams ] >> You, uh -- You know this, uh... >> What -- What did you do? >> Oh, we found your car with him in it. >> My -- My car? >> Yeah. He said it was his. >> A white Rambler, '61, license plate BBO477. >> No, no, that's his. He bought it from me last week. He paid $170. >> A white man is telling you the same thing I said. Now maybe you'll believe him. >> You shut your mouth. >> Ah, now, wait a minute -- >> Didn't you ask him? Didn't you ask him? >> Well, uh, maybe we made a mistake. Look, I-I-I'm sorry. >> Can I get my car back? >> Well, they -- they towed it in by now. 8:00 tomorrow morning. >> I have to be at work at 8:00. >> What kind of people are you? You stop private citizens in the street? You take away their property? What kind of people are you?! >> Hey, hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's over, okay? >> No! No! No! It's not okay! It's not okay! >> You're Jewish, aren't you? >> Yes. I'm Jewish. I'm Jewish! What are you gonna do, take away my store?! [ Dog barking ] You hear what he said? >> Please, Hal, please. >> That son of a bitch. Did you hear what he said?! >> Please, Hal, please. [ Engine starts ] >> [ Gasping lightly ] >> Okay, you go on inside, and I'll catch you later, all right? Yeah. Thanks. [ Gunshots ] >> What happened? >> [ Breathing heavily ] They -- They came and busted us, five of 'em. Damn, man, they were all over the place. >> All right, all right. Go on inside. Johnny will tell you what to do. [ Indistinct shouting ] >> Where you at?! What are you doing here?! >> Damn it, move it back! Move it back! >> Why don't you people go home? >> Why don't you go home? I am home. Hey, hey, brother. Brother, maybe he means Africa. Do you dig it? >> Yeah. >> Hey, by the way, are you home? Trap-ass dog. >> Johnny, Johnny, we're... >> Cops are gonna be rushin' us, man, hundreds of 'em. >> They'll wipe us out, man. We gotta stop 'em. >> Every time you move, blood pours out of that hole. Now sit still, damn it, or you'll bleed to death. >> Ah. Just -- Glass. [ Gasps ] Throw glass, bottles, anything in the streets. Then pour gasoline for maybe a block. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> All right, plant men in places where they can hide with firebombs [gasps] and others with shotguns. And when the bastards get in the middle of the gasoline, chuck them bombs, baby, and open up. >> Oh, outta sight. >> Those pigs, man. Come on. We'll tell the others. >> He's heavy, ain't he? >> You're killing yourself. You know that. >> He's right. >> You blow too much soul, man. Ain't no use you cuttin' out on a humbug. ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** [ Gunshots ] >> [ Crying ] Let me through! Let me through here! Let me through! >> Miss, we got a job to do!

Johnny. >> Go back home. >> Johnny! >> Don't shake him, woman. >> But he's my son. >> Yes, but he's bleeding to death. >> Are you a doctor? Will he be all right? >> Oh, he's all right. >> Come on, now. Billy Joe will take you home. >> Let go of me! Why is my Johnny hurt like this? You're the cause of it! >> He got shot by a white cop. >> Help me get him to a hospital. >> Mama, leave me alone! >> Johnny ain't goin' to no white man's hospital! Them motherfuckers would just let him die! >> Help me, doctor. >> Every time he breathes, he pumps out blood. Now, if we don't -- if you don't do somethin', he's got to stop breathin', one way or another. If I can get the bullet out and close up that hole... I'd like to go back to my office and get my instruments. >> Okay, Doc, get your stuff. >> Yeah, and I'm gonna make sure that you come back. [ Gunshots ] >> Why you do this, out here, with the police all over? Thank God you're not dead! >> I'm a man, Mama... a black man. And the one thing I don't need is that white man's god to help me. >> Your daddy's a man, and he don't -- >> Then where is he, mama? >> He's home, where you ought to be, instead of out here, shot up in this here alley. >> Is he hiding, Mama? >> Hiding? No, he's not hiding. He's stayin' close to his home. >> While his woman's out in the street. Bullshit! >> What do you know? >> Good nigger, work hard, kiss ass, and you'll make it. >> What do you know? What?! >> I know, Mama. And she knows me. >> You sit there and tell me she knows? I brought you into this world. I fed you and clothed you. And you tell me she knows. Boy, I'm takin' you to a hospital! >> No! You leave him alone! >> Don't you ever put your hands on me again. >> Can't you understand? It's because he's a black man, not the white man's black boy. That's why we're in this alley, them white pig's waitin' to kill us. [ Gunshots ] [ Funky music plays ] >> [ Speaking indistinctly ] >> Andre! Come on. I gotta take the doc here back to get his shit. And if I don't make it, well, you're the horse. >> How's Johnny? >> Bad. >> Come on, bub. You're losin' time. >> Brown said some white boy sent a message askin' what they can do. >> Man, we're through talkin' with white boys. Poof-butt mothafuckers. >> Your blood brother is losing blood. >> Shit. Okay, come on. >> I don't like this at all. >> Orders. >> This is madness. It's crazy. >> Maybe so, but we got orders -- "Get rid of him." [ Funky music plays ] >> Doc, you can help us get a free medical thing goin'. >> A clinic? >> Yeah, somethin' for the kids. They don't have no -- Keep walkin', Doc, and don't say nothin'. [ Music continues ] >> Clear the streets! Clear the streets! >> What's wrong? >> Do you see that guy?! [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Gunshots ] >> Ahh! >> Mnh! >> Did you killed them? >> What the fuck you think they're here for -- some goddamn afternoon tea? Come on! >> No, wait, wait! Don't shoot! I'm a doctor! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm a doctor! >> Wait! He's a doctor! >> He's still a nigger! [ Indistinct shouting ] >> Reverend, we can go out and help this man. >> No, no, no, no, no. >> Who the hell's gonna pay for repairin' my buildin'? >> A first-aid station. >> But we can't get in. >> What the hell are they doin' here? >> [ Groaning ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Gunshots ] >> The rat bite. Nurse...get... the rabies shots. [ Gunshots continue ] [ Siren wailing ] >> What's the matter? [ Indistinct shouting ] >> I see it. >> What? >> Nothing. [ Round chambers ] >> Hey! >> God damn. >> We gotta move Johnny! They killed the Doc. They're comin' through. And they're gonna kill him. [ Dramatic music plays ] >> Johnny. >> Hmm? >> Johnny, we got to move. Johnny. Johnny. >> Johnny! Johnny, they blew Doc away. Now we gotta move you. They're comin' through here. >> No, we ain't goin' nowhere. >> Don't. Don't. Don't. >> It's...come down... >> But you can't win. >> We don't have any choice. [ Gunshots ] >> I'm goin' out with the brothers. >> Yes. >> I hope... you don't die, brother. [ Gunshots continue ] >> Well, you know how that is. If it's over, then it is over. [ Gunshots continue ] >> Yeah. Yes. >> Come on, Black. >> [ Groans ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ Dramatic music playing ] [ Gunshots continue ] >> This place is crawling with cops. [ Gunshots continue ] We got split up, or we'll never find Johnny. We gotta get him out. It's our fight, too, no matter what happens. Talk to him. Make him understand that it didn't come down right and we gotta take it underground. [ Gunshots continue ] [ Music continues ] >> We work him over first? >> No. Let's take him in. >> Well, where's your white friends now? Them liberal bastards can't help you now, nigger, huh? >> My dad died fighting Nazi Germany, but he died fightin' the wrong ones. >> You black ape. You're fightin' the wrong people, too. >> [ Groaning ] ** >> Johnny! From yesterday. Some kids eat more, you know. >> Right on. >> Eh. [ Engine starts ] >> I swear to God I don't know the answer. >> [ Chuckles ] You will, man, as long as you're comfortable. >> They got bigger guns than you. >> We got no choice. And you have, and we don't. >> So, off with their heads? Shit, that's exactly what they want. >> It's that, or we decide to do some hard work, like that grocer. He don't gotta do nothin', but he wants to see somethin' different. >> All right, but we do it together, all of us, all the young people all over the country. Then maybe we won't have any violence. >> If we work together, there would be no need for violence. But we gotta know what we want. It's got to be important. [ Military-style music plays ] Oh, man. >> What? What the f-- [ Brakes squeal ] [ Music continues ] [ Music continues ] >> Well, I just don't see what it's all about, this hate, this violence. If it keeps up, you'll be giving the White people all the reason they need to kill you. >> Blacks have been exploited, raped, and murdered since this country began. >> Son, you know I like to hear it from the horse's mouth. >> It's what we do before we go because we have nothin' to lose. What we're all about is our young ones not havin' to be niggers 24 hours a day because if that happens... what do we live for? >> We're the ones with the hate, Dad. >> Well, it'll work out. Just give it time. We've got a democratic process here in America that allows us to -- >> The Democratic process. >> Well, don't you go to the polls? Don't you vote? >> Just look at what we've done to the air we breathe. I mean, your generation has left the world -- >> Wait. Now, you just wait. You can't blame my generation, as you call it, for all the ills in the world. >> Then what about the American Indian? Does -- Can he? >> Can he what? [ Grunts ] [ Door closes ] Where does that boy live? >> Why? >> "Why?" Somebody oughta put a check on him -- that's why. I think I will. >> What?
