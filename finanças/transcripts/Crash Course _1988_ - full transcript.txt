It's the first day of the last chance to graduate with your class. Give me a break. I didn't make something of myself by partying all night, and neither will you. How do you think I got my own truck fleet and chicken suit? Work, boy, work! Chicken suits aren't just hatched. Now, either shape up or ship out. Okay, okay. Your mother will have breakfast in 15 minutes. If you're not down by then, forget about dinner. You mean breakfast. That, too! These citywide test scores are an embarrassment. You're absolutely right, Mr. Paulson. Shut up, Fraser.Sorry. You know where your last semester's students scored in driver's education? In the root cellar! Lower than a snail's tail! Howard Evans from JFK High actually calls me on the phone and cackles at me like some demented loon. Right on, Mr. P.Shut up, Fraser. [STUTTERING] I'm having a bad year. It could get worse, Pearle. You're pulling my school's average down. The school superintendent isn't happy. When he's not happy, he takes away my sports program. That makes me very unhappy. When I'm unhappy, you know what that makes you? M-M-Miserable? I ask you, is this a sports nut's office? No, no, no, no. It is the office of a principal who happens to understand the proper balance between athletics and education. Now, the fact is that sports are very, very, very important. They teach our young people positive lessons, like the importance of physical fitness, the thrill of competition, the elation of winning, combativeness, aggressiveness... The values they need to know when they get on that freeway. Exactly. Fraser?Yes? You are a twit. Absolutely right, Mr. Paulson. Twit. That's cute. WOMAN: Wipe that off. Mom, I'm 16 years old. You don't have to remind me. Other girls wear makeup. Other girls are not as pretty as you are. You'll have plenty of time to cover your face when you're older. [GRUNTS] Why are you rough on him? ED: What do you mean rough? If you're not careful, he'll turn out like you. I'm warning you, Maxine. You'll be wearing this grapefruit. Oh, yeah? Where? You think I'm overprotective, don't you? Mom, you're driving me to school and we only live four blocks away. What do you think? I think you don't know the neighborhood yet. You've got to sign this. What is it? Permission to take driver's ed. Vanessa, we've been through all this before. I am not a child! We'll talk about it tomorrow! Pass this course and you'll drive to Princeton in a new convertible. Dad, do you know the stats? People get killed driving. I'll walk. If you don't pass driver's ed, you can't go to college. That's not fair! I'm an all-"A" student! Doesn't that count for anything? I don't make the rules, Chad. You need driver's ed to graduate. Besides, a new car will... certainly help you with the ladies. Face it, Dad. We just have different priorities. At this juncture in my life, ladies are not that important to me. You've got one last chance. Who, me?No, him. Shape up your driver's ed scores No, no, him! This is a serious matter! Careers are at stake, reputations, and more importantly, my pension. Uh, Wendell... Larry, never interrupt a tirade. I lose my train of thought. Now, where was I?Him. Listen. I want you to know something. I consider you a friend. But I've fired friends before, and I'll do it again. [STUTTERING] I need an advance on next month's pay. You have a rotten sense of timing. You're this close to being fired and you have the nerve to ask for an advance? You can't fire me! I'm under enormous pressure! My ex-wife needs new clothes. The divorce took a lot out of her. I'm sending her to Hawaii. I thought she divorced you? Well, just because you divorce somebody doesn't mean you don't love them. I guess I just don't understand modern romance. Now, look here, Larry. I like you as a person, as a teacher, that's a different story. But I'd like you to stay at Hamilton. Oh, I'm sure we can trust Larry to get back on the team. Sure, Abner. The problem is, the superintendent insists that I attend some cockamamie conference. I won't be here to check up on you, Pearle. Abner will be acting principal while I'm gone. However, I'm bringing in a heavy hitter for driver's education. Who, Mario Andretti? E.W. Savage. E.W. Savage?E.W. Savage? Attila the Hun behind a steering wheel. We don't need Savage. I can handle it! You've got six weeks to save your job and my sports program. You teach those kids how to drive and pass with high scores, or out you go. I think these little faculty chats are really great for morale, Mr. P. How's your eggs?Fine, Mom. ED: How's it look, the son of Smilin' Ed failing driver's ed twice? He couldn't pass his exam without smashing up his car. If you don't pass, you won't graduate. Bummer. You won't get your license. Never stopped his driving before. Get him off my back. As long as your father is putting a roof over your head and feeding your face, you'll play by his rules. If you're not gonna eat the eggs come here. I got something to show you. Come on. Smilin' Ed's Perfect Body shop. It's our new ad campaign. It kind of grabs you, don't it? I thought of it myself. Hey, come on. I'll drive you to school. Dad, do you have any idea how difficult it is to be your son? Get in the truck. The crowd's counting on us! We're going to get 'em! Are we ready? Are we ready? [YELLING] Yeah! [GRUNTING] MR. SANTINI: I don't get it. Driver's ed should have been a piece of cake for a Santini. Motor oil runs in our veins. You're right, Pop. You've got to pass this time. I'm depending on you, toothpick. Someday Santini and Son will be yours. Easy. I'm still a lady. That's right, you are. Someday, you'll bring class to Santini and Son. [SIGHS] Hey, get out of the way! [HONKING] Alice! Hey, hey! [HORN HONKING] Why does Maslanski have to repeat English Lit? Try, he's illiterate. Without compromising your principles, could you forget it? He'll have his hands full passing driver's ed. You're asking a man who worships Shakespeare to let a football player slide through school without knowing how to read See Jane Run? How many times in a life does See Jane Runcome up? Maslanski has a full scholarship to Michigan state. Who are we to judge? Just think, the next Heisman Trophy winner right here at Hamilton High.

BOY 1: Ah, come on.BOY 2: Be real. I want to thank you for endangering my job, my career, my financial future... [STUTTERING] And--And now that the divorce completed... Are you all right, Mr. Pearle? You kids are too young to understand what it's like when the only one you ever loved turns and says, "Get out of my house before I call the cops." [RAPPING] Come back to Earth, Mr. Outerspace.

So, anyway, my ex-wife sends me a note this morning with the latest bunch of bills. It started out, "Dear worm..." I don't believe this is happening. Mr. Pearle, may I be excused? Me, too.

I see your reputation has preceded you. I'm a legend. You'll be history if you don't sit down. Jock strap.EDNA: Now, Mr. Konner! This is how I eliminate smart-mouthed students like you. From now on, if you're even one minute late, you will receive a demerit on your permanent record. [ALL GASP] If you mouth off, you will receive another demerit. [BOY EXCLAIMS] Accumulate sufficient demerits and you fail. BOY: No way! Sounds like she's got your number, Riko. [LAUGHING] [GASPS] Um, perhaps the class... Let's see what we have to work with. Anyone know why we're here? To develop sufficient expertise in order to qualify for our provisional license. Excellent answer, Mr. Bennett, but insufficient. We're here to learn how to stay alive behind the wheel of a 3-ton killing machine. Okay, class, let's begin. Mr. Konner, what's the first thing you do when you get into a car? Hot-wire it. [ALL LAUGHING] Demerit. Take it, Mr. Bennett. You put on your seatbelt. Good. Miss Abea, what vehicle always has the right of way? My father's limo. [BOY LAUGHING] Demerit. Take it, Mr. Bennett. An emergency vehicle such as an ambulance, police car, or fire engine. If Miss Savage is finished with her classroom edition of--of--of Jeopardy, I'd like to teach the class something about driving. If you'd done that, we wouldn't be here. [ALL EXCLAIMING] Let's not waste anymore time. Mr. Maslanski, you're on a two-lane highway with a broken white line. You begin passing a car. Give me three reasons why you might not continue? You're going too fast. Exceeding the speed limit, that's one. I don't see where you're coming from. Yeah, an oncoming vehicle. Come on, Maslanski, a third reason why you can't complete your pass? [LAUGHING] My receivers are all covered. Cute, Maslanski. You'll be happy to know that your teacher does have a sense of humor. [LAUGHING] [GASPS] Demerit. Bennett! You can't pass if the broken line turns solid. Very good, Mr. Bennett. You do well on written material. It's a shame about your hand-eye coordination when you're behind the wheel. Chadley, the teacher's calling you spaz. Mr. Konner, do you know the meaning of "symbiosis"? No, sir. I thought not. Mr. Bennett? The living together of two dissimilar organisms in association, especially where this is advantageous to both. Genius, absolute genius. Mr. Konner, you could learn something from Mr. Bennett. You two will be a team, a symbiosis. I'm not associating with a geek. You will! You will all work together and be responsible for each other. Consequently, you will report here, Saturday, 9:00 a.m. sharp. [ALL EXCLAIMING] Oh, great. Having a bad day, are we? What is this we stuff? You hurt my feelings when you talk like that.

There's going to be four of us, me, you, and your two legs separated from your body. Now, move it! Alice. We're going to be in the same car, so I was thinking, we should get to know each other. Okay. Play a little football or something. Look, J.J., I don't have time. Why? Because I work for my father. I can't see you hauling concrete. That's what I want to do. And I need my license to do it. I won't have time for football. How about basketball, a little one on one? Loser out. Thanks anyway, J.J. [EXCLAIMS] BOTH: Are you okay? We haven't met. I'm Chad Bennett. I'm an A through K. Are you? Crawford. Vanessa Crawford. Must be fate. We're in the same part of the alphabet. Along with half the class.Yeah. Yeah. We're in the same part of the alphabet. That's totally impossible because my last name, it start with an A. Abea. Your last name, it starts with S. Shuganoy, whatever it is called. I forgot to tell you. I'm Americanizing it to Wang Chung. I haven't really seen you around here before. Oh, I just transferred. My parents divorced and we moved here last month. Oh, then you don't really know anybody, huh? I do now. Yeah. Let's move these babies out. Before you engage the two liter, twin cam, 16 valve, 135 horsepower engine, don't forget the BMPBs. Four point standard operating procedure, right? ALL: Right. Okay, what's this? You're the professor. You should know. Just answer the questions! Chad. The steering column, sir. Now, what's this? That's where they keep the guns. PEARLE: Guns? [IN SPANISH ACCENT] To kill people who try to kidnap you. It's no very funny, Vanessa. We move here to escape the Comunistas who raped my beloved homeland and tried to take our servants away. That's commonly known as a glove compartment, convenient for the storage of tissues, road maps, pencils, and pantyhose. My wife used to keep her pantyhose in the glove compartment. With her lipstick, makeup, and perfume. It would smell like a garden of orchids... Listen up, people. I'm talking major safety here. B-M-P-Bs! Belts, mirrors, park, and brakes! Now remember it! Use it! Live it! Let's roll. PEARLE: Santini, are you ready? Yes, I think so. Start your engine. [CAR ENGINE STARTING]Take a couple deep breaths. That always help me out before I punt. Mr. Maslanski, distractions cause accidents. Shift into drive. Yo, teach...Quiet, Maslanski! Step on it! Hit the brake! Hit the brake! [ALL SCREAMING] On roads like this, be very careful. So much to think about. If you can't handle this, how will you handle the freeway? I memorized the driver's manual and the aerodynamic coefficients of this vehicle. Careful, or we'll study the aerodynamics of that tree! PEARLE: [STUTTERING] Watch the truck. [ALL SCREAMING] [HORN HONKING] Don't wreck! Hold it!Go back! [ALL CLAMORING] CHAD: Help me! MAN ON TV: 1 and 2 and 3... Is that my headband? Yeah. Looks good, doesn't it? So how was your big date with the dentist? Not a dentist. He's a periodontist. Great. So? Every time I smiled, I felt he was assessing my gums. Like a horse. Once we'd exhausted the joys of flossing, there wasn't much else to say except "spit." [EXCLAIMS] Oh. FRASER ON PA: Maslanski! Maslanski! To the principal's office! Run! Now! [KNOCKING] Yo, Mr. Fraser. Sit down, Maslanski. How did a smart guy like you get caught a credit short? Driver's ed's supposed to be a gut course, so who studied? Don't worry, I'll pass. Maybe, but what about English Lit? Did you forget? You gave me an A. No, uh... I'm afraid I, uh... I gave you an F. Your buddy Mr. Paulson changed your grade. You'll have to take that English Lit final again. You can't do that! Who's going to stop me? [STUTTERING] Mr. Maslanski, you move me. Your grasp of English is absolutely stunning. I have chills. You, you... No, you'll take that Lit final again. So you better read your Frost, Mr. Neanderthal, and your Byron, and your Shelley. Otherwise, it's bye-bye Michigan state, hello, hamburger heaven. And when Mr. Paulson returns? [IMITATING MASLANSKI] Well, suppose he doesn't return. Get out of here. Move it! "When threatened with a head-on collision. ALL: "Number one, keep driving. BOTH: "Slow down as much as possible, "but do not lock the wheels. "Slowing down lessens the force..."

You're sick.It's just an idea... Guys. Superintendent Shriver? Acting Principal Abner T. Fraser here, sir, calling to let you know everything's under control. Uh, Abner Fraser. I replaced Principal Paulson. Yes, sir, I'm glad you asked. I'm a little concerned about how Paulson's running things here. Well, he brought in this maverick driving instructor. I'm watching her very closely, I can tell you that, sir. That's not what I mean. She is attractive, but... [DIAL TONE]Hello? Hello? Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Edna, we're gonna talk. You can talk. But I'm not listening. I'm busy. Got no time for chit-chat. Then make the time. I have got myself a career here. It took me 10 long years to reach this pinnacle of achievement. Who are you to take over my office like I don't exist? You don't scare me. I know your type. I had a wife like you once. She took advantage of me, but I was naive then. But I've learned, I have grown, and I am onto you! So don't play games with me, woman! I have been taught by the best! If you're so smart, you'd watch your step. I forgot to tell her to get out of my office! Okay, Kichisaburo. Drive. PEARLE: What the heck are you doing? You're on the wrong side. [STUTTERING] Move to the right! Right? Now? No, no, no! Move. The truck! Here, let me have it! [ALL CLAMORING] Let me have it! Why you drive on the wrong side of the street in America? Ah, come in. Come in. Mr. Fraser. Oh, please, call me Abner, Edna. Miss Savage, Abner. Please, sit down. Now let's see, where do I start? Get to it. I'm busy. Of course, Miss savage. You're a very attractive woman, a woman who's going places. I think you'll understand what I want. Yeah, you want Paulson's job. You'd like a BMW 635 and some bimbo sitting in the passenger seat. All right, let's be honest. Pearle is a fool who doesn't know cigarette lighters from turn signals. So let him do his incompetent best. Paulson will be out and the school will be mine. Ours. I don't like you, Fraser.That hurts. I'll make sure this driver's ed course is a success. As for Pearle's incompetent best, well, we'll see about that. Abner. World's perfect today, huh? We in America. It's a perfect country. The sun is shining. It's perfect weather, and I am here. The perfect man. Oh! Two out of three's not bad. [EXCLAIMS] Concentrate. You're on a highway... You're driving me crazy. Stop it. We have a mutual responsibility here. I don't care about responsibility or symbiosis. I'm a loner. That's how I like it. All right, look, look, look, You're passing and the accelerator sticks to the floor. What do you do? A: You pump the footbrake. B: Apply the emergency brake. C: Slam your foot down on the accelerator. What are you laughing at? That's the answer. That's the only way to get it unstuck. I didn't know that.There's a lot you don't know, diaper head. Okay, you're in an intersection...Stop it! We're making progress.What's the matter with you? Mom, calm down and listen. The whole class is staying late. We're practicing Castilian dialect. I will see you later. [GRUNTS] What was that all about? Don't tell anybody, but my mother doesn't know I'm taking driver's ed. You're not serious? She doesn't want to admit that I've grown up. If your mother doesn't know, who signed your permission slip? It was incredible. This huge bird came down and just handed me this signed permission slip. I think it was an eagle. Birds don't write.This one did. You wanted to see me? Sit down, Larry. Get comfortable. It's time you put your ex-wife behind you. Get on with your life. Whoa! Wait a minute. Is this some sort of ploy of yours? You sound like you don't trust me. What could little old me do to big bad you? [STUTTERING] Everything. That's my plan. You know, Lar, you're a nice-looking man. You're still young, you're moderately intelligent, and besides, you're not the only one who's been hurt by love. What would you know? You've never had a wife leave you. No, but I had a fiance. Oh, yeah? How close did you two come to getting married? About 50 feet. He came to the church door, opened it, saw me in that white gown, turned around, and started running. That's been hurtin' from since. No! You mean he left you at the altar? Oh, that is... That's terrible! It could've been worse. The gown wasn't paid for. But my point is, Larry, people have to move on in this life. You want to move on together? Want to get started next Friday night? Now, wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You are asking m-me out on a date? [STUTTERING] Under one condition. What's that? No more darts, please. I love a forceful man. No, this time it is serious. I know I promised, sir. Sir, I've run across some rot here. No, I'm not talking termites. I'm talking rot like in bad fruit, like in fungus. No, we don't need an exterminator. I'm talking scandal. No, this is bigger than low attendance. I'm talking Watergate, sir. Contragate. We have footballgate here, sir. Footballgate. Don't worry, I'm on top of it.

Yeah, they were pretty bummed when I decided to go to Michigan State instead. [LAUGHING] Go ahead and start her up. Are you sure it's okay?Yeah. Okay. [ENGINE REVVING] So, Hamlet, "The play's..." "The play's the thing where I'll catch a..." "I'll catch..." "I'll catch a bomber pass!" [LAUGHING] J.J. Shift into forward. [CLICKING] "Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King." Hamlet's proving that his uncle offed his father to hitch up with his mother. That's some wicked family! You're not taking this seriously. I'm taking one thing seriously. If you hit the accelerator, you'll off the car and garage because you're in reverse. Why can't I get that straight? I can't tell left from right and forward from reverse. It don't matter why. I'm here to help you. Doesn't matter why. [SCREECHING] Time to learn to change lanes. [TRUCK HONKING] There's an 18-wheeler behind me. I'm afraid. When there's an 18-wheeler behind you, you're supposed to be afraid. Turn anyway. But, Dad...Don't think about it. Just turn. Okay. [TIRES SCREECHING] Son, slow down! The accelerator's stuck! I can't slow down! This is a $60,000 driving machine! It can't be stuck! You got the dealer's discount! What do I do? Pump the brakes. Pump the brakes! Dad, it's not working! "C: Slam the foot down on the accelerator." No! No! No! No! No! No! It worked! [LAUGHS] Hey, you're right. All it takes is a little confidence. Thanks. [DOG BARKING] Hi, Bambi. Hi. Here you go. There you go. Ok, good. [TIRES SQUEALING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Don't come in yet! I can't believe it. When I won't go out with that louse, he charges me $1,500 for my gum work. Then some idiot in a car of teenagers tries to run me down, and then I destroy this lady's front yard and get a dent in my fender. How was your day? I can't believe it. What? Have you got a TV camera in here? Is that how you know what I'm wearing so you can wear the same thing? What's the matter? Look! No matter what I wear, you're wearing the same thing, and it's driving me crazy! Vanessa? Vanessa, what are you doing? Putting on makeup, mother. What girls usually do before dates. Date? Mom, look. You can't stop time. You have to face it. I'm growing up. And, Mom, you're not my best buddy. You're my mother. So, does this boy have a name? Riko Konner. Chicken-man's son? Where did you meet him? Driver... Um, school. We take a class together. Which one? Sex. What? We take human sexuality lab together. It's mandatory for health. I don't know, Vanessa. Should I show you the boy's report card? Come on, please? [DOORBELL RINGING] That's him. I'll tell him you'll be right down. That's a tow truck. Yeah. Vanessa tells me you're in the same class. Uh, yeah, we are. Your daughter's gonna do very well when I show her better moves. I beg your pardon. She's having a little problem with the teacher, so I figured I'd show her how to park. Park? The ins and outs of the whole thing. Not with my daughter, you won't! My Vanessa has always been a good girl, and she is going to stay that way, or her father will have something to say! Nice night. Mmm-hmm. Nice evening. Look, Edna... To tell the truth, it's been seven years since I've been on a date. I'm a little out of practice. Miniature golf could be fun, but there's a great movie at the drive-in tonight. Really?Uh-huh. The Tomato Who Ate Cleveland. Who'd watch a movie like that? Precisely. Now, I mustn't sound anxious. Just be calm and natural. Open up with some chitchat. "How's the wife? How's the children?" Superintendent Shriver? Abner Fraser here. How's the... [DIAL TONE] [WHISTLING] You really know how to treat a girl. Colors are gruesome, but it's wheels. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to be a total waste case. Let me ask you something. Is your dad really a cop? Who told you that? Your mother. She'll do anything to keep guys from me. Don't listen to her. That's a relief. Actually, he's FBI. [VANESSA LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY] Watch this. Hold on. Let me show you what these lights do. You're going too fast. You'd better slow down. Nah. Yeah. Nah. Come on. Come on! [TIRES SCREECHING] [SIREN WAILING] Do you know what you just did?Yes. Everything's fine. It's very cool right now. No, it's not. Are you a total lunatic? I can lose them! It's over! Relax! What are you doing? Everything will be fine! Stop it! I got to drive! Get over here! Everything's fine. Stop it! Let me out! Let me get out! See? And you thought we weren't gonna get along! Somebody was driving one of your tow trucks in more than a reckless manner, Mr. Konner. Officers, I don't know what to tell you. All my tow trucks are here. We've been closed since 3:00 p.m. Come on. This is leading nowhere. I'm telling you, Mr. Konner, if this ever happens again, someone's going to pay for it. [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] Dad, thanks for covering for me. I warned you, Riko.

Chad, let me talk to you. Chad?Yes. Look, I know that you think that I've been a goober, right? Oh, no, no. A diaper head. [LAUGHS] Right. Look, I got to ask you for a favor because I had this misunderstanding with my old man so I need a place to crash. Uh-huh. Right. So we're supposed to be responsible for each other, and the whole symbiosis thing, all that stuff, right? Let me think about it, okay? What? Flyspeck. [BELL RINGING] Flyspeck? "The bell invites me.

Just a little joke, Mr. Pearle. No joking while you're driving. Sorry. What's this with the joking? Ow! My contact lens. I can't see. Stop joking. No, I swear... Put your hands back... CHAD: I can't see! RIKO: Take it easy. You've got to keep it straight. All right. I'm trying! We're going to crash! I can't open my eye. [HORNS HONKING] [TIRES SCREECHING] I got it. Grab the wheel! No brakes! RIKO: Hold it! Hold it! [SIGHING] Hey, my contact went back in my eye. It must have been there all the time. I'll tell you the truth, Edna. I'm still a little shaky. I thought we were goners on that freeway. Forget about that freeway. Just think about the freeway you and I will be on tonight. Which freeway is that? The freeway of love. No brakes and all green lights. Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot. Good job.Thanks. Hey. Mr. Chad. Hey. What are you doing, bud? I got lucky. CHAD: Thanks a lot. I taught you good, right? You saved our lives, partner. So listen, Riko, you still need a place to stay? Yes, I do. As long as you lay off the symbiosis stuff. I'll lay off the symbiosis stuff, but it's Chad, not Diaper Head, not Needle Nose. Richard. You need a place to stay? You can stay at my place anytime. You're moving out? You know, you are going to beg to be with me someday. Maybe. You know, Riko, you seem to know a lot about women. I know everything there is to know. I'd really like to ask Vanessa out. Oh, that's easy. You got to act confident and ask this girl out. Act confident. Okay, thanks. Wait! Yeah? There is a chance, Chad, Hmm? that this girl could turn you down. I'd be destroyed. She likes guys who live on the edge. And you, you're still a babe in the woods. What are you... I live on the edge! Didn't you see me back there? There's more to living dangerously than driving on the freeway. You've got to do some dangerous stuff or this girl is gonna lose interest in you. So what do I do? Do something romantic.Romantic, yeah. You wanna set up something really nice, like a mountain scene with a nice beautiful day at a lake. Romance, yeah. So you take her to an adult motel. I couldn't! I have too much respect for her! Respect has nothing to do with it. My parents have a house at the lake. Okay. No, forget it. I have no way of getting her there. What are you saying? Of course, you do. Borrow a car. Borrow... You're talking about stealing! These are the pro moves and that is living dangerously, okay? Here, wear these. It will increase your cool quotient. Remember, pro moves and confidence. You're a dangerous man and an animal. Get this girl! All right! [CHUCKLING] Oh. I swear, Alice, there's nothing between Maria and me. Yeah? Well, where did this come from? Tough scrimmage down at the barbershop? Alice. Oh, man. Alice, calm down. J.J. does not like Maria. Sure could have fooled me. Okay, so maybe he finds her body interesting. Gee, thanks. No, he needs you. Sure he does. Alice, he's studying with you. No other girl has ever gotten J.J. to quote Shakespeare. Trust me. Once he passes that English test, he'll know who to thank. I hope so. Get out of here. See you. Hi there.Hello! The name's Bennett, Chad Bennett. Excuse me? Vanessa, it's time to show the world the real me. I thought we ought to start from scratch. Chad Bennett, it's very nice to meet you. It's mutual. I was thinking maybe you and I could go out sometime. Like Sunday afternoon. If you're not busy, that is. You aren't busy, are you? I've got a date. With you. Chad, this car is school board property. We could get into trouble. Not to worry. Come on, relax. I got them now! Wait till the superintendent hears about this! You don't have a license. Or a car, but that's not stopping me! What if Savage finds out? Hey, come on, I thought you liked to live on the edge. There's a difference between living on the edge and driving off of the edge. Riko said you liked guys who live dangerously. I don't want to go out with Riko. I want to go out with you. [POLICE SIREN WAILING] I'm sorry. I just wanted to spend a romantic day with you. That sounds real nice to me. I'm just worried, that's all. What's to worry about? It's no problem. I just wanna tell you what these past weeks have meant to me. Well, don't tell me. Show me! All right! Looks like we both could use this workout. I got them both! Thank you. I can't follow him and I can't... I'll follow them. I can't follow them. I'll follow them. Why do you do things like this to me? [BIRDS CHIRPING] What did I tell you? Isn't this nice up here? Beautiful. You still think this was a lousy idea? I'm beginning to like it more and more. I'm beginning to really like living dangerously. Me, too. [TIRES SCREECHING] VANESSA: What's wrong with him?CHAD: He looks drunk. He's going to hit us! [VANESSA GROANING] No! WOMAN ON TV: If we set off this atom bomb... [TELEPHONE RINGING] This better be good because you're interrupting Zombie Death. Chadley, did you know your remote control was broken? You what? [GROANING] Look, J.J., you have until tomorrow morning. Do you want this football career or not? I'm tired of geeky poetry. My brain is fried! [DOG BARKING] I got an idea. I'll just take your notes to the test. You even think of that, and you can find another girl. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. Hi, Riko. What? My old man will slice me, but we got to. Because Chad and Vanessa are our friends. Dynamite! [WOMAN SCREAMING ON TV]Bye. I'll call the others. J.J., we're going to the lake. Now that's more like it. If Smilin' Ed catches me this time, I can reserve a room at Leavenworth. Could you back away from the truck, please? Where did you learn how to do that? Girl scouts. I sold the most cookies in my country. You learn a lot in the middle of a revolution. How does it feel? Like I'm the stupidest jerk on the face of the earth. You'll feel worse when Miss Savage gets you. Tell me about it. Is Vanessa all right? He's going to love this. This is hot! Superintendent? This is Abner... [DIAL TONE] Oh, phew! I can't believe the difference one session made for you. I'm a mess, a physical wreck. I'm falling apart. You're just getting ready for the ultimate workout. Oh, yeah? What's that? Me. Whoa!

Dad, I can explain. I got a better one. I found Mr. Fraser trapped by Bambi on the roof. He kept swearing that kids were vandalizing the place. That's obviously not true, Mr. Konner. Oh, spare me, okay? You took the truck, didn't you? Yeah, but I didn't take it for myself. I've had it, Riko. Now, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna make a list of the parts you took, because you're gonna pay me back. Fine, no problem. Then, you'll pack and move out permanently. You don't have an ounce of responsibility in your entire body! You're wrong! Riko's very responsible! He did this to help us! It's never Riko's fault. He's the perfect kid. You don't give him credit. Listen, Chad and I got into trouble last night. Riko knew you'd give him hell if he helped us. He was unselfish. He organized everything. That is all Riko's work. It is true! Riko turned out to be someone you can count on. A good friend. Come on, guys. Let's take it back to school. You can stay at my place. Hi, Mom. Did you have fun at Alice's last night? Did you guys study? Baby, what happened? I had a little accident. It's nothing serious. Nothing serious? I've been taking driver's ed behind your back. It was wrong, but, Mom, you wouldn't let me, but I had to do it. I'm sorry. Sorry just isn't going to cover it, young lady. At least you finally owned up to it. You mean you knew? Well, I may be naive, but I'm not stupid. There's a lot more to tell you, but I have to go upstairs and get washed up. I have a driver's ed final. Vanessa?Yeah? Good luck, honey. Thank you. You look beautiful today, Mom. Won't work. Right. Right here after school. Okay. I'm too tired to have a fight. Riko, I came to tell you something. You did the right thing helping your friends, and I'm proud of you, Son. I want you to come home. Now, get your butt over to school. You got a final to pass. If they let me take the test. Well? Go for it. Thanks. There's J.J. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Hey, J.J. Are you ready for the test? Yeah, as ready as I hope to be. What's that noise? Crib notes. Alice. Wait a minute. I want to talk to you. About what, cheating? Alice is right, J.J. All right! Um, Miss Savage, Mr. Pearle, I'm really sorry I stole the driver's ed car. It was completely irresponsible on my part... I told Chad to steal the driver's ed car. I told him he should live dangerously. I didn't think he was going to do it. I guess I took the symbiosis thing too far. Well, you two, I respect your honesty. Riko, you've taken a giant step in your relationship with your father. Congratulations. But what you two did was wrong. Very wrong. There are rules. Gentlemen, we have got to live by the rules, symbiosis or no symbiosis. Yeah, I get it, flunk city. [SIGHING] Come on. EDNA: Sit down! I make the rules, and I rule that since both of you... Sit down! This is my department, and I make the rules. And I say that since both of you have shown that you are able to take responsibility, you should take the test with the rest of the class. All right, sugarplum? Whatever you say, sweet lips. Now, get your symbiosis out of this office! [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [LAUGHING] Yeah! We worked everything out. MASLANSKI: I'm happy. I hope everyone who was responsible for Mr. Pearle's and my little accident last night has studied for their driver's ed final, or none of you will graduate. Come on, let's go. FRASER: Miss Savage?
