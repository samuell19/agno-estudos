Forty-five an hour okay? Forty. Call me so I have your number. Nomi. That's your name? What kind of name is that? What kind of phone is that? I'll text you when I need you, okay? Okay. Or you can call me. Why would I do that? I don't know... Maybe you get lonely. I do. [UNCORKS BOTTLE] My daughter is still undefeated. [POURS DRINK] My... My oldest, remember I told you about her? NICK: You must be proud. She's a winner, like her old man. Salud. But you know, her weight class, most of the boys don't even have hair on their coin purses yet. But still... Three years undefeated, boy, girl, nobody. High school wrestling, of all things. [CLEARS THROAT] You know, uh, the guy you worked up, he's not a friend of mine. But he's a friend of this place. So... We gotta part company. Professionally speaking, that is. It's your severance. I respect you. That's why we're having this drink, you understand? [POURS DRINK] I bet you she loses. [CHUCKLES] That's a tough bet. That's a tough bet. I got one for you. I bet you never fight in the ring again. What about that? You'd take that bet? Let me know when you lace 'em up again, kid.

Maybe you should take some time before you, uh, jump on to another night crew. Get back in the gym, even. To teach, I didn't say fight. I got nothing to prove. I know you don't... Do you? [WATER SPLASHING] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] [SNIFFS] [RUNNING] NOMI: Oh, karaoke. - I don't like karaoke. - [LAUGHTER] Why? - We hate it. - It's the worst. Although you sang a lot of Sade. I always get everyone so depressed. Like, I'm the worst to take to karaoke. [NOMI SIGHS] - I'll see you. Call me. - Yeah, I'll message you, yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Are you gonna stalk me like some creep, or walk with me like a gentleman? [SIREN WAILING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SIREN BLARES] [THUNDER RUMBLING] MAN 1: Fuck that motherfucker. MAN 2: I know. MAN 1: Aw, beautiful. Mmm. Look at this. - Wow, marry me. - Oh shit, sweetie! Let me have your phone number. Aren't you gonna say something? They're harmless. I guess. You're hurting me. I-I'm coming from a place of love, why do you gotta hate? [LAUGHING DRUNKENLY] - Shh! - I'm just... I'm trying to show my love. What is it you think I do, exactly? I don't know, some type of art. - Where are you from? - The Bronx. Ah yes, I figured that. You from around here? I am from far, far away. Bay Ridge. A Nuyorican. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You know that guy you beat up in the club the other night? What about him? He wasn't my boyfriend or anything. What do I care? He deserved what you did to him. [THUNDER RUMBLING] I live here. - This is your place? - Yeah. You must love what you do. Fulfill fantasies? Who wouldn't? Goodnight. Goodnight.

This car is, like, brand new. - Yeah I built it up from junk. - You built this? I didn't build it, but I fixed it. Took me about five years. Ten, to be exact. I got kicked out of high school so I went to trade school instead. I was also kicked out of high school. Jinx. That's not how it works. - Hey. - RECEPTIONIST: Hi.

You know the sun's not that good for you, right? I proposed here once. NOMI: What'd she say? Yes. What? Tell me everything. What do you wanna know? She was nice, she was pretty. We used to work together. So what happened? It fell apart after I lost a fight. I heard you were pretty good. I don't remember losing. I hear it sometimes. The thing is, I don't know if it's a memory or a dream. So she was a fair-weather fan. Nah, she was cool. I hurt her. Her feelings. The end. Or the beginning. NOMI: How're you doing over there? Good. You like those? Yeah. Try them on. Do you have them in a 10 and a half? NOMI: Can I have a minute? Please take your time. [SIGHS] I may have screwed up. They only have one room for both of us.

BRETT: Rice and ketchup. - NICK: Is that a thing? - [BRETT LAUGHS] LACEY: No, I wasn't eating rice and ketchup. It's a cheap immigrant family type. - Yeah, wow! - Spanish people do it.

ROSIE: Oh, sorry honey. Gym is closed. Does it look like I'm here to fight? It's cool. What's up? DRIVER: Are you Nomi? NOMI: Yeah. So you're that boy. The one that's been hanging around my daughter. Yeah. You know, when my mother... When I was pregnant, my mother knew I was gonna have a girl. She told me that baby is gonna show you the real meaning of life. So when Nomi was born, I knew she was that baby. You see, I know my kid. I tried to teach her how to survive here, how to keep herself from being hurt from men that would do anything... to get what they want from her. I did the best I could. Nomi's a tough cookie. Maybe too tough. NICK: There's no such thing. I'm sorry for your loss. Hey, Irish... wanna know what the key to a woman's heart is? Be there. I'm actually a whole bunch of different European races. Whatever, baby. [VIDEO GAME NOISES] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I'm not allowed to answer the door. Hi, is uh... Nick home? No. I just came to wish him luck. Do you know who I am? LACEY: Yeah, that's a bad idea. What? Wishing him luck or... me in general? Both. LACEY: It's superstition. I'll tell him you stopped by, but after the fight. How's that? Boys are ridiculous. NICK: Who was that? How's your weight? NICK: I'm two pounds over. Who was it? NICK: Nomi. NOMI: Hey! What are you doing here? I... just came to make sure you're staying out of trouble. You look good. Thanks, so do you. Flattery will not work. You cannot have your job back. I shouldn't have left like I did. Yeah, we... We both did things we shouldn't have done. I heard you came to the wake. Yeah. I'm sorry. She wasn't in any pain, so... Anyway, I brought you something. There is a track on this flash drive that I think is the perfect walkout song. Thanks. Do you wanna come? I leave tomorrow to South America, I have like, a full month of shows. Flying on the red eye. I'm bad luck anyway, right? That's what your boy just told me. Yeah, you probably wouldn't have liked it anyway. I should pack. I haven't even done it and... I... Yeah, I should go. I'll see you. You can call me if you want. Why would I do that? You get lonely? Do you? All the time. Okay go. I hate goodbyes. Nicky. You don't have to win. I know. [ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Where the hell is this boy? Gee, Nicky. Glad you could make it.
