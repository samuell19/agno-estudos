Listen, boys. The reason you are all here today is not because you did something wrong or you committed a crime. You are all here because of a small mistake. Don’t think of this as a prison. Think of it as a hostel and that you have come here to study. A lot of people who have studied here became teachers, doctors and lawyers. If you are really interested in studying hard, the government is ready to sponsor your education. Since that’s the case, each of you tell me what your goals are and what you wish to study. Sir, my name is Kumar. I want to become an advocate. Good. If you are able to fight for justice in the courts, you can become a judge as well. Do you understand, dear one? Sit down. Sir, my name is Sravan. I want to become a police officer. If you want to get into the police force, you only need to finish your tenth grade. And if you complete your bachelors and prepare for the UPSC examinations, you can become an Superintendent of Police as well. What is your name, young one? My name is Surya, sir. In the future, what do you want to study? CM. GM? No, sir. Not GM. I want to become the CM. Chief Minister. It’s from the party office? Hello? What is this, Mr. Subba Raju? Why would you call for such a hurried meeting in the middle of the night? Well, in another ten days, the results of the election are going to be announced, right? The surveys must be out. Madam must have seen those surveys and the predictions must have made her tensed. Perhaps that is why she arranged the meeting. Do you think that is all there is to it? Of course, what else could be the reason? Please forgive me for arranging a meeting in the middle of the night and calling you all here. It’s fine, madam. We are ready to take such small inconvenience for the sake of our party’s future. Why did you call for a meeting, madam? It’s because I checked all the voting surveys. The surveys say that out of all the 175 seats of the state assembly, the ruling party is predicted to win 40% …. and the opposition party, i.e. us, would secure 42% of the seats. The Independents are predicted to win the remaining percentage of the seats. Therefore, if our party is to form the government this time, we would need another ten seats only. If we are able to persuade the representatives who have contested independently across the state, to come to our party, this time, we will form the government for sure. Please tell us what you want us to do now, madam. Just a single command from you is enough to make hundreds of people, who support you, rush to do your bidding. But since you set them all aside, and came to meet me in such pouring rain, I can understand how serious this issue is. Tell me, what would you like this Basha to do for you? Please start work from the ground level up on all the independent candidates who are going to win the elections this time. Even before ruling party gets their hand on them, let’s try to buy them off. Even though I am getting old, my political journey is still continuing in the opposition seat, Basha. That is the reason why, no matter what, I want our party to form the government, Basha. You are right, madam. But what is the guarantee that that dog, Durga from the ruling party, hasn’t already entered the fray and tried to sway the minds of the independents in their favour? One must always chain the dog that bites. Isn’t that the reason why we’ve orchestrated the filing of many airtight cases against him and put him in jail? Do you think his influence is curtailed because he is in jail, madam? To ensure that’s the case, you must do something for me. Please tell us what you would like us to do, madam. There is a prisoner in the central jail. Send some ten people into the prison and kill him. What is his name? Durga. He is most dangerous animal. Ajay, some people are hitting our guys. Come on. Just leave that to me, madam. I will take care of it. Do you think this is a jail or the ground in which you play PUBG? Why don’t you speak? Why did you hit them? Just that gaze…if you can keep your attitude in check, the time that you spend here will be safer. If not…you don’t know about me. I will take you and throw you in Tihar jail. What are you guys staring at? Take him and throw that idiot in the cell! Jailor sir. -Tell me, Basha. What’s up? I am sending ten of my men to the jail. Who are you targeting this time? Durga. Durga? You mean the ruling party’s man? Yes, sir. That very same fellow. How much money did you take from the opposition party to kill him? What about my share then? The money will be transferred into your account as it usually is. We are going to come to power in the state this time around as well. That is why I have arranged for a party at my farmhouse tomorrow. Hello? -Mr. CM. I am Madusudan from Central jail. I called you to tell you some important news. What is it, tell me? The opposition party has hired people to kill one of your men in the jail. If you don’t need that man, they will go ahead and finish him off, sir. But if you say that you still need that man, we will even lay down our lives to protect him, sir. That’s what going on. Do you want us to save your man or do you want us to leave him to those killers? Give me ten minutes. Alright, sir. I will wait for your call. Just a second, baby. Hello, uncle. Tell me. The opposition is planning to kill Durga in the jail. Is there anything he still can do for us? Uncle, right now, he is the only one who can do things for us. In a few days, we are going to come back to power. Why do we still need him? This time, your imagination is wrong, uncle. We are not going to be in power. The polls predict 70% of the voting to be in their favor. What makes you say that? In all the election survey reports, they have polled much better than us, uncle. If that’s the case in the counting as well, we would definitely need a few MLAs to win these elections, uncle. To threaten them or make them submit to our party, the only option that we have is Durga, uncle. And he is the most powerful weapon we have today. If we say we don’t need him at such a crucial time like this, we might end up giving up the power to the opposition. Until the election results are declared, there shouldn’t be a single scratch on our fellow in there. Just leave that to me. I will take care of it. But it looks like protecting your man is going to cost a lot of money, sir. I’ll take care of it. I have a small doubt, sir. What is it? You took money to kill him and now you are taking money to save him. Between these two choices, which one is it that you are going to pursue, sir? I am slightly confused. Fool. In English, this is called Politics. In Telugu, it’s called 'Rajakeeyam' (Politics). If these people have come into the jail once again, it looks like some biggie’s head is going to be off soon. When are you planning to kill him? If possible, today. Forget about today. Tomorrow is Mulakat. It would not be possible. Plan for it the day-after-tomorrow. Alright, fine. But you need to remember this. That day, I will only give you half an hour to kill Durga. You must finish him off in that time. If not, I will not give you an opportunity to kill him again. Go. Move! Here, brother. Let’s go Let’s go. Didn’t I ask you to come with me? What is it? Earlier, you were staring down at my guy. Stare at me if you dare Come on, look. Why don’t you try it again on me this time? Look! I am asking you. Look at my brother the same way you did earlier. Look! Look! You don’t know about me. I will take you to Tihar jail and throw you in. Someone is here to meet you. Go! It’s almost time…go… Go… Hey, leave You must leave. Let’s go! The time is up. Come through. You there…come! Come! Alright, fine. I shall take my leave. Take care, buddy. -Be careful. Shiva, how is Bhavana? Finally, you remembered. I thought you forgot. "Did you know? Did you know? Your heart is the owner of my breath." "Did you know? Did you know? Your little smile if a gift for my heart." "You are the divine beauty." "My heart is filled with thoughts of you." "Why don’t you come to me as my reward in this life?" "The beauty of this woman is the pandal for moonlight." "The friendship with this beauty is enough for me." "I must tell you of the dreams that I’ve dreamt of you. Why don’t you sit in my lap once?" "When the beautiful goddess is beside me and is my other half," "The path is strewn with blooming flowers." "You are the music in my love." "Did you know? Did you know?" "Did you know? Did you know? Your heart is the owner of my breath." "Did you know? Did you know? Your little smile if a gift for my heart." Durga is in the washing area. Don’t make too much of a mess and kill him. What are you guys looking at? Throw them in the cell. Tell me, Jailor sir. Bhasha, even if you send ten more people into the prison, you will not be able to kill Durga. What happened, sir? What do you mean what happened? Someone here thrashed the hell out of all the ten people that you sent in here. I am not sure if any one of them will make out alive out of this mess. If you have some nonsense such as this to take care of, do it outside the jail! Don’t plan such things in the jail. Cut the call! Madam, I was not able to live up to the faith you had in me. Take this gun and kill me here right now. If not, give me another opportunity. This time I’ll go to the jail and kill Durga. In another one week, the election results are going to be out. If the results are not in my favor, that is when I’ll tell you who needs to be killed by whom. My name is Durga. Surya. Thank you for saving me yesterday. I heard about you. Aren’t you in jail because of a murder case against you? Surya, tell me if you want to work for me. I will get you out of this jail and make sure there are no cases against you either. How is that possible? I have the favor of the ruling party. If you agree to work with me, as soon as my party comes to power, I will make all the cases against you go away. If you are certain that you can make all those charges against me go away, I am ready to join hands with you and get down to doing any sort of work. From today onwards, we are friends. Why did those people want to kill you the other day? The people from opposition party were trying to kill me for a very long time. This time, the opportunity presented itself in the prison. That is why they came to kill me. What if they had killed you that day? At the most, I would have lost out on meeting a good friend in prison. Who is it, baby? Hello, this is Durga speaking. Tell me, Durga. I met someone in the prison, brother. He is in here on a murder charge. But looking at his confidence, I feel like he belongs to a totally different league. Listening to what you said, I get the same feeling as well. He will surely be of assistance to us. Alright, fine. If the election results are not in our favor, you might need to come outside. Alright, brother. That’s when I’ll talk to my uncle and make sure to get the both of you out of there. Tell me, Surya. Surya, this society will never change and neither will the people in it. In the past hundred years of history, did you ever feel that the pattern of voting changed? Why should we bother, Surya? Please listen to me. Let’s forget about all this here. Listen, Shiva. You might be right in saying that this society will never change. And the voting pattern of the people might not change either. But we must change the leaders who govern the people. What happened, sir? Why did this happen this time? What should we do now, sir? No matter how, this time around, the government is going to be formed by us. Madam, your party is leading over the ruling party this time. What is your opinion on this? The people have begun to trust us. That is why our party is in the lead this time. Thank you. Madam? CM Ram Mohan Rao is on the phone. Tell me, Mr. Ex-CM Ram Mohan Rao. What do you think about the election results this time? Just because you’ve scored a couple of seats more than us, don’t think that you’ve won, Ms. Shyamala Bharath. If you want to come to power, your party needs another 10 MLAs. You must buy those ten MLAs. You must acquire them and bring them to the test of strength. That is why, even though your party scored 4 seats more than my party, and even if my party loses another four seats your position in the assembly is going to the same as it always is i.e. towards the opposition. Don’t forget that, Ms. Shyamala Bharath. Alright, fine. Mr. Ram Mohan Rao. This time around, let’s see who is going be in the opposition. Good Luck. Even though Mr. Ram Mohan Rao knew that we were in the lead, he strongly stated that we are not going to win. That could only mean that he has something big up his sleeve. According to the lead that we have, for our party to win the elections and come to power, we must buy off those 20 independent contestants as soon as possible. There is only one way to buy those 20 independent MLAs, madam. What is it? We must buy off the undefeated MLA Kalyan Prasad from Anakapalli, who has always emerged the winner for the past 20 years as soon as possible, madam. What’s unique about him? He is the kingmaker, madam. These 20 independent MLAs are usually in his control. If that’s the case, call him here immediately. Call Kalyan Prasad and ask him to come to our farm house and meet me immediately. Okay? -Okay, sir. Looks like everyone is here. You are the one who is late. Hold on…hold on Namaste, madam. Madam, let’s come to the point straight away. It would save the both of us a lot of time. I would like to come straight to the point as well. The 20 MLAs in your control must support our party. Tell me how much money is it going to cost per each MLA. Each of these MLAs spend around 50 crores to win in their constituencies. Each of these MLAs costs 100 crores. What? Each MLA costs 100 crores? That means the whole bunch is going to cost 2000 crores. Yes, madam. Why is it that expensive? The market is very expensive, madam. At one point of time in the past, the cooking oil would cost 90 rupees per liter. Now it costs 230 bucks. Aren’t the people buying it? And are we really thinking about the people? Not really. That is the reason why the voter has increased the cost of his vote based on the rising prices, madam. Once upon a single vote would cost a thousand bucks. Now it costs 5,000 bucks. No one votes because of a particular candidate, madam. They take the cash that’s given by them and then vote for them. Now, if your MLAs need to support our party, we need to pay you 2000 crores. Is that it? Not 2000 crores, madam. What do you mean? 2500 crores. What? 2500 crores. What’s that 500 crores for? That’s my commission, madam. Your commission is 500 crores? Yes, madam. I am not giving you some auspicious offering, madam. I am giving you the authority to rule this state for 5 years. To fulfill that, it’s not wrong to take 500 crores as my fee, madam. The ruling party has been calling me. If you are okay with my proposal, I will cut this call. If not, the government this time is going to be theirs again. Think about it. Sir, Kalyan Prasad has been cutting our call. Try him again. Okay, sir. Sir, the phone’s switched off. Send him a voice message immediately. Okay, sure, sir. The 2500 crores that you asked for. Make sure there’s no discrepancy anywhere. On the day of proving two-thirds majority, the 20 MLAs with me will be with you like dogs following you around. They will sign wherever you ask them to. Get ready to take the oath as a CM, madam. But before that, we need to do something. What is it, madam? Ram Mohan Rao would come to know that you have joined hands with me. Then, it might not be safe for our MLAs. That is why I booked the entire of a star-hotel in Bangalore for our MLAs to stay safely. Until our strength is tested, all of them will stay there. If we send our MLAs along with yours, all of them can be at the safe at the same place. You are right, madam. Just for the fear of Ram Mohan Rao, there is no need to put all the MLAs at a place that is 500 kms away from the city. That’s ‘cause there is a place that is unknown to the entire city and that is under my control. If we save our MLAs there for the next ten days, it would save us a lot of time and it would be reassuring for us to know that our people are close by. But where is this safe place in the city? Sorry, madam. Until the strength is tested in the assembly, I will not disclose the location to you either. Alright, fine. I will send my MLAs along with yours to the underground place that you suggested. Take good care of them. Okay, madam. Sattanna. -Sir. Shyamala Bharath bought Kalyan Prasad for a price of 2500 crores. What are we going to do now, sir? Does that mean our government collapsed? Sir, I spent a hundred crores in this election. What is going to happen to me, sir? Tell us, sir. How do we deal with this, sir? -Please say something, sir. Please tell us. -Stop it! There is no need for any of you to worry. There is still time for the two-thirds majority test. I know very well what to do. I understand what you say. What do you want me to do now? Durga should come out of the jail unofficially as soon as possible. It doesn’t matter how much money it costs. Talk to the jailer and get that done. Alright, uncle. I have a request, uncle. What is it? There is another person along with Durga who needs to be brought out of prison, uncle. Who is it? His name is Surya. Apparently, his guts and courage are entirely on a different level. It may be so. But how can I place such kind of trust in a stranger? This is an issue that’s related to the state government. If anything goes wrong, my entire political career would be ruined. Please believe me, uncle. If our government needs to survive, Surya can do more active work than Durga. Alright, fine. Since you sing such high praises of him After the deed is done, the both of them need to be back in the jail. I want to meet him once too. Hello, madam. I have some information that could be favorable to you. Tell me. Durga escaped from the jail. Take care of your MLAs. You just let them go and you already gave the other party the information, sir. Only when those people fight amongst themselves, people like us would be safe. Stay here this night. Tomorrow, the meeting with my uncle might take place at any time. As soon as I call you, please start and come. Madam, I shifted all of our people to a safe place last night. I am unable to explain to you in words how happy they seem. Be that as it may. First, listen to me. Tell me, madam. I got information that the ruling broke Durga out of the jail. I don’t know what method you resort to. Make sure our MLAs there are safe. Madam, even if ten people like Durga break out of jail, it’s very difficult for them to know where our MLAs are. Well, if the other side is planning for things, it means we are quite cautious. Please don’t be tensed. Until we meet the challenge of the 2/3rd majority, forget about them, even you wouldn’t know where your MLAs are at. That is how carefully I’ve planned, madam. Alright. All of you be careful. This time, my estimates regarding the election results were off. It looks like I might lose power. I don’t know what the both of you are going to do. No matter how much money it costs, make sure that the 20 MLAs that Shyamala Bharath bought, come to our side. What is your plan to make that happen? What are you going to do? We are going to kidnap all of them, sir. Kidnap? Yes, sir. Do you think kidnapping 20 MLAs is as easy as kidnapping school children? Not just 20 MLAs, sir. Along with the MLAs from the opposition party, the total comes to 72 MLAs, sir. What?! 72?! Along with the 48 MLAs from your party, I am going to make sure that a total of 120 MLAs is locked in your Bangalore farm house. If we don’t do this, you will not be able to become the CM this time, sir. I have no problem with the locking opposition MLAs. But why would you need our MLAs? They are our people, aren’t they? They are politicians, sir. They are not people. They will sway in the direction of power. Power is more important than winning, sir. Given the situation we are in, we have to protect our MLAs ourselves, sir. That is why it’s essential to lock up our MLAs along with theirs, sir. Upon listening to it, your plan seems alright. But…how will you kidnap the MLAs from opposition party? Is that even possible? Everyone wants to win in the war, sir. But there can only be one victor. That man is called a hero. You are talking to a hero, sir. So when do you think is the right time to put this plan into action? This Friday. Get all of your MLAs onto a bus and hand them over to Durga. Durga will bring them to the Dabha on the Bangalore Highway. Meanwhile, I will take on the responsibility of kidnapping all the MLAs of the opposition and bring them there. Good. I like your confidence along with your plan. There are 2 crores in this bag. This is just an advance. If everything goes according to the plan, along with taking back the charges against you, a lot of such bags will reach you. This time as well, you are going to be the one who will be sworn in as the CM. Get ready for that. "I keep slipping away when you catch me.' "I am the ambrosia with charms and guile." "When you touch me, I turn into fire." "I am the matchbox with beautiful dimples." "Who was it that showed me their knife?" "Who was that?!" "Who was that who poked me with their gazes?" "Is that him?" "Who was that who intoxicated me?" "No matter who it is, I enjoyed it. Oh dear." "You surround me and run around me." "Please don’t look at me like that." "Like a vine you entwine around me." "Don’t keep pulling me towards you." "If the red lip touches you, you heat up." "The whisky turns cold on such a fair body." "Who was that who pointed a gun at me?" "Who was that?" "Who was the one who stunned me?" "Is that him?" "Who was that that poked me at the back?" "It doesn’t matter who it was, I enjoyed it." "You keep hitting at me and melting me away." "Don’t keep tearing at me." "Don’t waste me like that." "My waist keeps swinging about like a delicate vine." "I am a little one, have some mercy." "Who was that who switched off the light?" "Who was that?" "Who was that who gave me a passionate kiss?" "Is that him?" "Who was that who wore a tight bun?" "It doesn’t matter who it was, I enjoyed it." The last call that Kalyan Prasad made was at 11 o’clock last night from Gulzara House, Surya. Since then, he hasn’t been in touch with anyone. That means he is at Gulzara House for sure. Who is it? Madam, there is some bad news for you. The ruling party is planning to kidnap all your MLAs in Gulzara House. You must immediately shift them from there. If not, you will not be able to become the CM. Who are you? Your well-wisher. Alright, everybody get on. Tell me, madam. Where are you? I won’t tell you that. I am serious. I am being serious as well, madam. I am being serious as well, madam. I will not disclose it. Do you think I don’t know that you are at Gulzara House What? Is there a new app that came on Google search? How did you find out such a secret place? Not just me. Even the party in power knows where you all are. What do we do now, madam? Before they come there, take all our MLAs and shift from there. How can I suddenly take these many MLAs and shift them to some other place, madam? I am sending the bus. Go to my resort in Bangalore. Do you understand? I understand. Madam. -Basha, it’s time for you to get to work. Tell me, madam. We are immediately shifting all our MLAs on a bus to Bangalore. Until our bus reaches its destination safely in Bangalore, you must follow it. Alright, madam. Wait at the Bangalore Highway with your men immediately. Okay, madam. Hello, madam? I am the travel bus driver, madam. -Where are you? I am exactly at the location that you asked us to go to, madam. Alright. Our people are going to be there. Wait there. Alright, madam. Tell me, madam. The bus is here. Start immediately. Okay, madam. The bus is here. Start now. Come on. Get on… Come along now. Madam, everyone climbed onto the bus. Shall I start, madam? Okay, madam. Tell me, Surya. Our plan is a success, Durga. All the MLAs are in my control. If so, wait at the highway Dabha. I am starting as well. Okay. What is… Tell me, madam. The bus has started. In a short while, it’s going to get on Bangalore Highway. If you feel like someone is following our bus, kill them right there. Madam, the bus just crossed us. Follow the bus carefully. Okay? Yes, madam. Come on, move it. Tell me, Basha. Just now, the bus just now stopped at a highway Dabha. Why? Since it’s a night journey, they must have made a stop to have some tea. Do you really need to call me for such minute things? Madam…madam… -What ever happened again, Basha? There is another bus that halted behind our bus, madam. Another bus? -Looks like it’s the bus of the ruling party. What? The bus carrying MLAs from the ruling party? Yes, madam. I am quite sure that it’s their bus. Why is their bus there in the first place? Madam, I get the impression that they are doing the same thing that we are doing sending the MLAs to Bangalore. But why would the two buses come to the same place at the same time? Do this. Until our bus safely gets out of there, keep an eye on the ruling party’s bus. Alright, madam. Tell me, Basha. Madam, our bus driver hit the bus drivers of the ruling party’s bus and took control of their bus and is driving on. What? What do you mean our drivers are taking over their buses? That is what I don’t understand, madam. Fine, I’ll call our driver and find out what’s going on. First, follow our bus. -Okay, madam. Hello, madam. -Anwar, what are you doing? Someone came and hit me and took our bus away, madam. Tell me, madam. -Basha, they are not our drivers. They are some criminals. Go and stop them immediately. Stop them right now. Alright, madam. Drive faster! Faster! Tell me, Ms. Shyamala Bharath. Why did you call me this time? Looks like you are in a very relaxed mood. Shall I tell you something shocking? Tell me. What is it? Until now, at the assembly, I thought it was the both of us who were in competition. But now, a third person entered into the fray. If I tell you what he did, your heart’s going to stop from the shock. Only when you tell me what that third person did, would you know whether my heart would stop from the shock. You brought a beast out of the jail. That beast along with another beast took both your MLAs and my MLAs, Mr. Ram Mohan Rao. If I get to know that there is some connection between you and that third person, you will never have any sort of political future ever, Mr. Ram Mohan Rao. What happened, uncle? Call Durga. He isn’t picking up, uncle. Call his friend. This is the first time in my political career that I trusted someone and was betrayed. Who the hell are you?! I already told you, didn’t I? Everyone wants to win in the war. But there can only be one victor. And that person is called a hero. Now, that war has begun. By and by, you would understand who that hero is and why he’s in this war. Until then, wait and see. What is this? We were told we are headed to a resort in Bangalore. Did we take another route? This looks like a deep forest. Sir… I trusted you and gave you some work. There’s nothing wrong with beating myself with my own slippers! Don’t ever show me your face again! You brought one stranger into the circle and made him such a huge burden to me! Look at what he’s done. Sorry, uncle. Forget it! Call that DGP and ask him to come to the farmhouse. Okay, uncle. Why did all of you get into our vehicle? -Damn it! When our party is in the lead, why would we need to join your party? Since we are in the lead, you guys joined our party. Watch out! Forget about being in the lead. Tomorrow, we are going to emerge as the winners! Stop it! Why is everyone shouting? You will all be thrashed! You can say what you want to us but we will not take it if you insult our party. Come forward. Show me how much your party’s pride is worth. Show him. Go on, show him. Stop it! Stop it! SILENCE! What are you looking at? This isn’t the assembly where you can shout as you please, and fight as you please. This is a forest! My forest! My forest! There is no speaker here and neither are there any mic. And you cannot walk out of here. You are deep inside the forest which is at least 250 kms away from the highway. Youngman, are you a Naxalite, Maoist or a terrorist? Who are you, young man? Where do you think those people were born from? They were born from the wrong doings committed by people like you. Sir.. I’ll believe what you say. But I have diabetes. If I don’t eat on time and have my medication, my nerves and my entire body start shivering. Aren’t you the health minister? Yes. You own a lot of big hospitals and yet you don’t enjoy good health. How will you serve the public? Sir, no matter what you say, we are not in a position to listen to you. First, feed us and then you can talk to us. Why is the rice like this? Will anyone ever eat such kind of rice? Why? Isn’t this the rice that you give to the people in the ration shops? Did you ever think of how they would feed themselves with such rice? That’s enough. One must eat the required amount of rice. We shouldn’t eat more than that. Well then, why did you amass so much wealth? You should have said enough. But you would never do that. Listen, your words and deeds are indeed extraordinary. But the only thing that’s ruining your credulity is the covering up of your face. We would be satisfied. If you look at my face, you will not be able to take it. Really? Do you think of yourself as Lord Narasimha, huh? If that’s the case, take a look. Show us. The thing that decides our future is the college. The thing that helps us design our future is the college indeed. Swami Vivekananda said that the future of our country is in the hands of the youth. But as youth, what are we doing about it? We are living selfish lives where we are more concerned with what’s happening with our lives rather than sparing a thought to the country’s future. Are you saying that educating ourselves and taking up a job is being selfish? The problem isn’t about education or taking up a job. What is it, then? The problem is that we don’t think about the future of the country. Isn’t that the reason why every five years we vote and elect leaders? They will take care of all that. That is where you are all wrong. You are just voting for them and letting it be. As students, you might not have any authority to take any decisions. But you are capable of establishing a better society. You have the right to question them of their actions. When you do that, you will prove Swami Vivekananda’s words of the nation’s future being in the hands of the youth, to be right. We will give money to buy nets and we will give you loans to buy boats. These are the promises that the leaders gave us before the elections. Even though they have been in power for the past 4 years, they did not fulfil even a single promise. How long are you going to tolerate this? How much longer are you going to bear with it? Go and ask your MLA. Question him! Do you know why our country gives the right to vote for someone above the age of 18 years old? It’s for them to pick a good leader for themselves and vote for them. But what are we doing about it? We are looking at their castes and casting our votes in return for the money they give us. If this continues, your children and your children’s children will end up facing the same troubles that you are going through. Friends, from today onwards, let’s change this habit of voting for a leader based on their caste. Let’s destroy the culture of votes for cash. Let’s show it to the future generations that casting your vote is a tool to change the future. Who are these people? They are students, sir. They keep moving around amidst people and lecturing them on the public issues and solutions. Sir, nowadays, this is fashionable. Alright, fine. Make sure that our image isn’t spoiled because of their public speeches. Sir, we bought those votes with cash. We will not encounter problems because of them. Ask our people to keep an eye on these fellows here. Okay, sir. After we come back from Delhi, we will deal with these people. What can I say, young man? All the problems of this village are unsolved. When we want to discuss about these things, the ward member doesn’t come here. The Sarpanch doesn’t care about it. The corporator doesn’t work either. And regarding the MLA, it’s been four years since we elected him. In these four years, we have spent a lot of time going back and forth between his office and his home but I swear, we never saw his face even once. Listen. -Sir. We went to the neighbouring state, didn’t we? Yes, sir. Why are these flexis here like we’ve arrived in United States? Yes, sir. Well, now that they’ve already done this, I must admit that the photo is indeed nice. Who put this up? Who else, sir? It’s those students. I am certain that the MLA would react upon seeing these posters. Yes, there would be a reaction. But there’s no way to know how he’s going to react. No matter how he reacts or the magnitude of the problem, we must all be ready to face it. It’s not at all like you imagine it to be. Looks like you are all from respectable families. You are all educated, aren’t you? Why can’t you go and get a job? Why do you want to put posters up like illiterate people? Why do you need to involve yourselves with the politics? You wouldn’t understand this. I must give unbelievable amount of faith to people. I must promise them innumerable things. If necessary, … You mean to say that the voters should prostate at your feet? Brother, what fine insight you have! You might think voters are like feet. But we consider votes to be feet. That is the difference between yourselves and us. On the day of casting their vote, they become kings. After the voting, for the next five years, we are the kings and the minsters. You mean to say that there is no one to question you? You tell me. How does the voter who sells his vote after taking money from us have the right to question us? All that happens now is not elections. They are just about collecting money. We collect votes, they collect money. One vote costs 5000 bucks. One and a half lakh votes i.e. 75 crores. And on top of that, food and liquor, entertainment, posters and publicity campaigns… And apart from these, the gifts we give our superiors. It costs anywhere between 150 and 200 crore rupees. And the interest for these 200 crores along with the principal, we need to earn 1000 crores. Those five years are not enough for earning those 1000 crores back. Where will we have the time to do public service, young brother? Why should we serve those who sell their votes? He doesn’t have the right to question. That’s because he sold his vote. I am telling you this for one last time. I started my life as an alleyway goon and now I’ve become a minister of a state. Don’t turn me back into an alleyway goon. The elections are close. Last time, they asked for 5000 bucks for a vote. This time, they are going to ask for 10,000 bucks per vote. We need to get ready to meet that demand. Here, we need to pay money to get the votes as well as the seat. If the party high command ignores me, I will be at a great loss, young brother. Please don’t come in my way. If anyone does decide to stop me, all your date of deaths might end up being the same even if you share different date of births. Remember this. I shall take my leave, brother. Dear one! Dear one! Everything worked out well. We went to the tea estate and gave them an advance. The next month is going to be about elections. The month after that we are going to register that estate onto our names. Idiot! Take a look at this. You might think voters are like feet. But we consider votes to be feet. On the day of casting their vote, they become kings. After the voting, for the next five years, we are the kings and the minsters. Today’s breaking news! MLA Kalyan Prasad has exposed himself of the corruption he indulges in. Sir, look at this. The voter doesn’t have the right to question us because he took money from us. What happens now is not elections. We are simply collecting our money. All your date of deaths might end up being the same even if you share different date of births. Remember this. Since Mr. Kalyan Prasad spoke in this manner, the party high command has removed him from the position of a minister and suspended him from the party. They’ve removed you from the post of a minister without consulting you at least once. This is really unfair, sir. What’s unfair? He was the one who admitted to being the most nasty and evil person around in the video. He is the leader for all those stupid fools! Eat. Eat really well. What other work would you have now besides eating and sleeping? Goodness! You showered me with such false promises. You talked about a tea estate in Ooty and coffee estate in Karnataka. You said that if you win the next election, you would be a home minister and I would be the wife of a home minister. And then you talked of being the Chief Minister and me being the wife of a Chief Minister. Do you really think you can make me the wife of a chief minister?! Now, you cannot become a chief minister and I end up being the wife of a useless man! What should I do now to become the wife of a chief minister? Why are you looking at me like that? Tell me, what must I do? Enough with you harassing me! Get lost! Remove it! Remove it! Take it off! Please forgive us, sir. We are teaching our folks how to catch fish. It spilled on you by accident. You please leave. Surya? Sorry, sir. While catching fish, it’s not possible to catch all the fish in the ocean, sir. We just catch those fish that fall into our nets. Please don’t mind us. Please leave, sir. Surya! Surya! Surya! Tell me. Tell me who sent you. Tell me! Tell me! What are you looking at? You must be wondering why someone who should have been dead came back alive. Killing me is not something you or even your father can achieve. Vote is a man’s right. Nobody can buy it. MLA is only a representative who brings the people’s problems to the government. It doesn’t mean you are the king of a constituency. You are a mere servant. Since you forgot all about it, we’ve put up posters to remind you of that. But you didn’t get that. I just wanted to change you. I never thought of changing the representative of this constituency. Now I am going to change it. Get ready to fight with me in the next election. You are not going to be able to collect money because we are going to elections. Smile. His name is Vinay. He is going to contest against Kalyan Prasad in our constituency. He was born here and knows your troubles. He might not be able to buy your votes by spending money. But he is going to do justice to each vote that is cast in his favour. By electing him, you are all going to win. Or else are you going to vote for Kalyan Prasad and spend another five years to injustice and illegal endeavours. It’s your choice. Young man, we voted because of the money they gave us. But now we will vote for the good deeds that you do. We never found a leader who is out there to do good. Please contest, sir. Next time, all our votes are going to be for you. Is that so? You are leisurely playing a game of cards here, sir. And there, someone is getting ready to contest against you, sir. As long as there are people who take money and vote, all these things don’t matter. The tree that you plant will give you shade. The vote you cast will decide your future. Decide who you want to vote for. We will repair punctures! We’ll repair punctures! What is it, young man? Do you have a flat tire? Yes, brother. I am in a bit of a hurry. Could you please fix my flat tire? I will. He is going to be an MLA in the future. Please fix his tire properly. You use this route everyday and to think that your tire gave out today, doesn’t that mean something’s fishy? And to top that, a man who fixes tires is out here peddling his services. Don’t you find that strange? And isn’t it strange that you guys are contesting the elections? You are an MLA, sir. You’ll head to the assembly. Where will we go, sir? We will be back to being goons. Do you know what will happen when we go back to our roots? Murders, killings, maiming and rapes. Do you know who we kill and maim? Your friends. We are going to brutally murder your leader Surya. Do you know who will remain in that aftermath? Those fair girls who are in your company of friends. We will use them as we please, enjoy them as much as we like and take them to the red-light district in Mumbai and sell them there Think about it. Come on, guys. I want to tell you guys something. But you must not get angry. That means you are going to tell us something that will make us angry. Not that. If not, what is it, then? Tell us. We… we are not going to contest in this elections. What?! Tell me the truth. Did someone threaten you? Nothing of that sort. We are not going to contest these elections. That’s all. I can see fear in your eyes. What is it? Yes, I am scared. So what are we going to do about it? If you are that scared of dying, why did you agree to contest in the elections? Tomorrow is the last date for the filing the nomination. We are all going to be waiting at the MRO’s office at 3 o’clock in the afternoon. You will come there and file your nomination papers. If you still don’t do it…I don’t know about these guys but I will kill you and throw you in the ocean. Remember that. Tomorrow at 3 o’clock at MRO’s office. Come on, guys. Vinay, we are going to be waiting for you there. What happened to him? What does he think of himself? His phone is not reachable. My messages aren’t getting through to him either. Keep it. We might need it for some program or another. Namaste, voters. Please give me your precious vote. You will vote for me. You will definitely vote for me. Before the auspicious time gets over, I will go and file my nomination papers. Namaste. Try calling Vinay again. What’s going on? Why didn’t he come here yet? Brother, looks like your candidate didn’t come here yet. The inauspicious time will be upon us soon. We are arresting you. Arrest? Why? Sir! Come to the station. We will discuss there. -Why are you arresting him? Surya! -Move it! Put the foot here. Take that sickle. Sir, what exactly is going on here? We are not the ones doing it. You are the one getting this done. Take the sickle. Inspector, I need to speak to my brother. Okay, sir. Young brother, you thought you were the only one with brains. Even if I am not as smart as you, I do have a bit of brain. I used the very same weapon that you used. Social Media. Tomorrow is the last date for the nomination. You are coming to the MRO’s office and filing your nomination papers. If you still say no, I will kill you and throw you into the ocean. Young brother, politics is like the ocean. To sail on these waters, you either need a ship or a boat. You just wanted to sail with your arms. You are going to drown in the midst of the sea. Useless people like you are the ones who need boats and ships. I don’t need it. I will chase you, hunt you and catch you. That’s because I am a shark. He really is a shark. He abducted us and brought us here What else is he going to do? Let’s go. -Let’s go and beg him. Let’s go. -Let’s go and beg him. Despite the situation, the weather is still pleasant. Hurry up and move. My tummy is upset. Looks like I might have to take a dump right here. Brother, if your bowels are moving this early in the morning and that too right on time, your health condition must be superb. I think because of the fear and the forest herbs infused in the drinking water, we all seem to want to take a dump at the same time. Don’t keep shooting like that. I am shitting bricks right now! Master, what’s the meaning of that sound earlier? [Singing song] Do you have any sense?! Why would you do such foolish things in the twater? I thought of it as a leech I also assumed it to be a leech. Is a snake this small? A snake is this long. Fool! It might be sleeping. Don’t you know the difference between a mother snake and a baby snake? You stupid turd! You only know about a sleeping snake! You guys never let me take a dump in peace. You never let me bathe in peace. What is this situation that we are in?! It’s not just one or two MLAs. He’s preplanned this entire operation and kidnapped a total of 120 MLAs. I don’t know what to do now. If either the media or the people get to know that I am the one who made this happen, the political career that I’ve strived to achieve through all these years is going to be ruined. Don’t you worry about this anymore, sir. Leave this to me. I will take care of how to get the MLAs from the grips of the kidnapper. Kiran. -Sir! Contact Dhruva wherever he is and ask him to come to my office and meet me. Okay, sir. I shall take my leave, sir. Sir! Sir! What?! He told us all about you. Really, what happened to you was unfair. I won’t deny that. But if that one person committed a wrong, why would you bring all of us here ? If need be, keep him with you here and let all of here go, please. Alright. As you said, I will let everyone here go. But before that I will ask you three questions. If you answer them correctly, I will leave you today and in fact, right now. Please ask. Go ahead and ask. Question number one: How many amongst you know who Sunny Leone is? Why wouldn’t we know her, sir? She is my favorite porn star. Every night, I am unable to fall asleep without watching her videos. Question number two. How many of you here know who Pooja Hegde is? I am her hardcore fan. [Singing Pooja Hegde Song] Sir man, her latest hit is Ala Vaikuntapuramu lo. [Singing Pooja Hegde Song] Shut it! Third question. How many of you know who Narayana Swamy is? Sir, you mean the Lord Annavaram Satyanarayana Swamy? You know who Sunny Leone is. And you also know how many movies Pooja Hegde acted in and who all she acted with. But, you don’t know the Narayana Swamy who lost his life for the people. Who is he, sir? Is he a God? Yes, he is a God. But he is not the God that’s in the temples. He is the God that lives in the hearts of the people. Narayana Swamy. Namaste, sir. Namaste. Namaste. What is this, woman? Can’t you figure it out by looking at it? It’s rubbish. That I understand. What you’ve thrown and what you did are both rubbish. But why are you throwing rubbish onto the roads instead of throwing it into the bins? I throw them in the bins everyday. Just today, I forgot doing that. Oh goodness, you speak English. Don’t you know that you must throw garbage only in the dustbins? It’s because of such behavior that people are dying of some unknown diseases. Really? Look there. There’s garbage overflowing the bins and the people of the municipality who are responsible for cleaning up that mess are nowhere to be found. I’ve been waiting for a week to see if anyone would show up. And you say that the diseases come just because I threw the rubbish on the roads. Hello? Is this the Municipality office? Hello? Who is it? Is it Mr. Narayana Swamy? How did you know? Did you put a camera in the phone? Not at all, sir. If the landline ever rings in the office, it is always you, sir. Tell me. The dust bins are filled to the brim at Sundaraiah colony. The entire colony is stinking. Could you please get it cleaned? Oh? That? We are not responsible for cleaning up the garbage, sir. We’ve given the contract to a private company. What? You gave the contract to clean the rubbish to a private company? What are you doing instead then? We answer people like you who call us up and ask us such doubts. Alright. Give me that contractor’s number. Hello? Is it contractor Gangadharam? Yes, it’s me. Who are you? I am Narayana Swamy. You are the one who took the contract for cleaning the garbage bins in Sundaraiah colony, right? Yes, it’s me. The garbage bins here are full and the entire colony is stinking. Why don’t you clean it? Oh, that? The previous contract term is over, sir. We are filing for a new contract next month. We will clean those bins after we secure the tender. Are you just going to leave it like this until then? You should be a little responsible. If you have such sense of responsibility, why don’t you take up the task of cleaning it? Thank you, dear. I just cleaned right now. Did I just clean it so that you can pee all over? There are public bathrooms out there. Why don’t you go and pee there? I’ve been peeing here for a long time. From tomorrow onwards, don’t pee here. Forget about tomorrow or the day-after. Two days later, I will still be peeing here. Why? Why didn’t you pee? You are good boy. That is why you couldn’t do that. This is a seed. Why are you looking like that? If you throw it away, it dissolves into the earth. But if you plant it, it will split apart from that very earth and come out as a plant. You are like this seed. This seed becomes a big tree and will give you fruits. Even if it doesn’t give fruits, it will provide shade to a minimum of ten people at the least. It will give rain. The seed that you plant will grow and become big. It will also leave your legacy behind for the next generation. It’s your choice if you want to plant it or throw it away. Hello? Do you have any sense? It’s so clean here. Why would you relieve yourself here? Aren’t the public toilets over there? Why don’t you go there? If I go there, I would be charged two rupees. Drinking water costs a mere rupee. But to relieve oneself it costs two rupees? Just go! I am leaving. Listen, you shouldn’t hold the national flag displaying it upside down. That’s wrong. You must hold the national flag like this. The saffron color is at the top and the green color is at the bottom. Come. Hoist the flag. What’s with that look? Not just the seed that you planted. The seed that I planted is beginning to grow as well. It’s going to become a big tree. Come. Hoist the flag. Who are your parents? What do they do? My parents were in the marijuana business. The police beat my father to death. My mother is in the prison. Aren’t you studying? I used to study. But my mother asked me to quit studying and go trade marijuana. That is why my mother stopped sending me to school. And so even I didn’t go to school and study. Do you want to study now? I do. Mister, it’s wrong to sell liquor in front of the school. And you are selling alcohol to minors. Don’t you know that selling alcohol to persons below 18 years old is illegal? Laws are like handkerchiefs in people’s hands. You must just fold them and keep them in your back pocket. Tobacco can be sold beside school but alcohol is not allowed? We took a government license and started a shop here. We are lamenting the loss of our business. And here you are talking about law and crime like they do in the movies. Forget about just serving the school-going kids. If an infant comes and pays money to serve it alcohol, we would oblige. Business is the only thing that matters. Why are you talking in such an arrogant manner? Yes, I will most certainly speak this way. What are you going to do about it? Sir…sir...sir… Inspector. Beating him up is not legal, sir. Present him in the court tomorrow. You’ve made that liquor store shut shop and did us all a great favor, sir. If men like you become our leader, I am sure you will do many great deeds for people like us. And so, people elected Narayana Swamy as their MLA with a huge majority. Narayana Swamy wanted to do something for the people who have elected him. Therefore, he went to each and every house to understand their problems and issues. That is when he found out that even though the river Godavari flowed close to the area, the water from the river was not being used for either agricultural activities nor drinking. He began to protest against the government’s incompetence of not providing that water to the public. He surveyed the entire constituency, enquired after the geographical problems of the area, worked on bringing solutions such as the crops that could be produced in abundance given the environmental factors of the area…. He wrote a book on many such problems of the area and went into the public. What’s notable about my victory today is not that I’ve won. Instead, your vote for me has enabled the victory of democracy here today. This change should be the foundation of the change in our national politics. This book in my hand, describes the flaws and problems in our constituency, lists out all your needs, and my methods and solutions on how to counter those flaws. This is our constituency’s constitution. I will definitely fight for every issue in the assembly. I swear on the assembly that in the next five years, I will fight to change things around in our constituency. This is my oath to you. Honorable speaker, this is the book containing the problems of my constituency. If you can allocate me a bit of time, I will speak to you about all the problems plaguing my constituency. Silence! Silence! Why are you guys laughing? Did I crack a joke? Of course not! So, why do you all laugh? Honorable speaker, looking at Mr. Narayana Swamy, I feel that he hasn’t come to the assembly. Instead, he looks like someone who came to school bringing his books. What are you saying? These are the problems of my constituency. Stop it, sir. Silence! Silence! Despite the speaker asking for silence, you guys continue to laugh. Please, stop laughing. Honorable speaker, please ask them to stop laughing. The house is adjourned. Tomorrow at 8 a.m. Mr. Bhasker Reddy, please speak. Honorable speaker, given the utterly useless governing of the previous government, the entire state is in shambles. The reason why I say that it is in shambles is because the governing which should have been like how Lord Rama ruled Ayodha, has turned into a monster-ruled place, honorable speaker. That is the reason why I am forced to speak like this. What the hell are you saying?! How dare you call our rule ‘monster-reign’? Just because you have a mouth, don’t speak as you please, Mr. Bhasker Reddy. I will be watching as to how you are going to rule in the next 5 years. What do you think you will watch?! Just shut up and sit. We won’t sit quiet. Absolutely not. What are you going to do? What am I going to do? You know how much majority we have in the assembly, don’t you? 100. Once we decide on not letting you go out of the assembly, not a single person of your party will be able to leave the assembly. Just as you, the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war were a hundred people too. But you do know what fate they suffered, don’t you? No one here is incompetent. Enough with your foolish prattle. Sit down! Who the hell are you to tell me to sit down?! I am saying this in front of you. If anyone of us goes berserk, none of you people would be able to leave the assembly. Yes! Yes, you will not be able to leave! Silence! Please, silence! What do you mean we cannot leave? You mean to say that you are going to beat us up? If you have the guts, come at us. We shall see. Just because we are quiet, do you think that gives you a license to get aggressive? You are the one who egged us on? Do you think we are incompetent and weak people that wouldn’t be affected by you pushing our buttons? Or did you mistake us for you shameless people? Shameless, huh? If that’s the case, come at us. Let’s decide this once and for all here and now! - Come, let’s decide this! How many of your people want to do this? Come and give it a go! Let’s decide once and for all. How dare you? Sit down! Please sit down. He’s gotten used to stuffing his face….Please stop. -Mr. Bhaskar Reddy, please keep quiet. Please shut up. You don’t know about us. Come... Think about serving the people as well. Please sit down. Everyone, please sit down. Silence! Silence! I am adjourning the session for half an hour. The MLA of the Bhadrachalam constituency, Mr. Narayana Swamy, is requested to speak. Honorable speaker, I would like to say something with the members of the assembly as my witnesses. Proceed. Honorable speaker, everyone here is a representative of the people. They have won because the people have voted for them. Instead of talking about the people who have voted for them, why would they shout at each other in front of the entire house? This isn’t good behavior, honorable speaker. This is shame on the name of democracy. Honorable speaker, Mr. Narayana Swamy speech disrespects all norms regarding the assembly. We are not sitting here because the people have blindly cast their votes for us, honorable speaker. And he dares call us shameless people?! Mr. Narayana Swamy must apologize to us for this insult. He must apologize! -Silence! Silence! -He must apologize. He must apologize. -Silence! Mr. Bhaskar Reddy, I only said that this behavior is shameful for the democracy. I never called you all shameless. Instead of wasting the time of the assembly with these fights and apologies, isn’t it better for us to work together and solve the issues and needs of the people? You mean to say that we incite fights? You dare lecture us and our chief Minister on how to run the government? Honorable speaker, Mr. Narayana Swamy must apologize to all the prominent leaders in the assembly! Yes, he must apologize. He must apologize. Silence! Please don’t feel bad about what happened in the assembly, sir. Everything will settle down and you will once again get an opportunity to discuss our problems in the assembly. What is the use of giving a microphone to a person who cannot speak? Even if there are numerous opportunities, what’s the use? He should at least open his mouth and speak. Govind, what nonsense are you talking about?! Have you gone insane? Shut up and walk away from here. Get lost! Sir, please don’t mind him. There is nothing wrong with what he said, Subbaiah. You are looking at his anger. But I am looking at his worry. Honorable speaker, even though there are a good number of rivers in my constituency, the people of my constituency have fallen behind Because they do not know how to avail these opportunities. Even though I have told the ruling party of their plight numerous times, they aren’t allocating funds for the projects here, honorable speaker. If this is the case, what is going to happen to the people who have placed their trust in us. Please tell me, Honorable Speaker. Mr. Narayana Swamy, we will definitely talk about the problems in your constituency in the coming sessions. Please sit down. Honorable Speaker? I didn’t start speaking yet. How can you ask me to sit down already? Mr. Narayana Swamy, please sit down. Mr. Srinivas Goud, please speak. Honorable Speaker, this isn’t in keeping with the decorum of the assembly. Please let me speak about the problems of my constituency. Please, Mr. Narayana Swamy. Please sit down. At least, give me ten minutes, Honorable Speaker. Please. Mr. Srinivas Goud, start speaking. Honorable Speaker, looking at the rule of Chief Minister, I feel like Lord Rama ruling over Dwaraka in the Dwapar Yug. It’s not just me who thinks so... Even the people say the same thing, Honorable speaker. Honorable speaker, Lord Rama’s rule was in the Treta yug. Lord Sri Krishna was the one who ruled in Dwapar Yug Tell him to get these details right before speaking, Honorable speaker. I already told you, didn’t I? If you take an incompetent person and make him sit in the assembly, he isn’t a leader. A leader is someone who evokes respect, awe and shiver in the assembly. He must threaten them. If necessary, he must face them and fight with them. Those are the qualities that a leader needs to demonstrate there. He has none of those qualities. And even if he learns these things now, he will not be able to learn them. Instead of attending the colleges, we went around and campaigned for you for a week and made you win the elections as the MLA. Why do you think that is? It’s because we thought you would help us get jobs and help us improve our lives. But looking at you like this, I have no faith that such things would happen, sir. Please don’t be offended by what I have to say. The one who opens his mouth and shouts in the assembly is seen as the leader. Only men like that will be able to get the work done and would be able to solve problems. Please listen to me and resign from the post as an MLA. The MLA of the Bhadrachalam constituency, Mr. Narayana Swamy, is requested to speak. Honorable speaker, even though there is water all around our constituency, there isn’t even a single drop that’s available for drinking. Please think about the pitiable state that the people of my constituency are in. Not just this issue, honorable speaker Education, health, roads…and if I have to keep going on, the constituency is ridden with a lot of problems. That is why, at least now, please… Honorable Speaker, according to Mr. Narayana swamy, only the people in his constituency have problems. But given the illicit liquor that’s being pumped into the state by the ruling party’s enabling antics, the people are losing their lives, Honorable Speaker. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Just because they are in power, the ruling party has made making money their goal. Are they really ruling the state or running alcohol business? They must answer this question, Honorable Speaker. They must answer! They must answer! Honorable speaker, we are only selling alcohol in the shops. But when the opposition party was in power, they ran brothel houses, Honorable Speaker. Bhaskar Reddy, what the hell are you saying? Madam Ramadevi is the head of that. -You are running your mouth?! What the hell are you saying? I will skin you. Honorable Speaker, ask Mr. Bhaskar Reddy to keep his tongue under control. Silence! Silence! What was wrong with what I said, Honorable Speaker? Everyone here knows Ms. Rama Devi here, her entire background, and what she did in Chilakaluripet long ago. Bhaskar Reddy, you are being indecent! How dare you?! How dare you slap our leader with your footwear? How dare you! -You and your foolish leader?! You dare slap me with your footwear?! Stop it! Is this the assembly or some nonsense? Don’t you guys have any shame?! The ruling party must rule and the opposition party must question their motives. But what the hell are you guys doing?! Is this the reason why the people have elected you and sent you here?! Shouting that people must change isn’t enough. Amongst the population of 5 crores of people, only 290 people have come here. That means that it’s not the people who need to change! We don’t have to fight and go to war for the people who have placed great faith in us, voted for us and elected us. It would be enough if we can just discuss their problems, and find solutions for their wants. But what the hell are you all doing?! You introduce schemes that are beneficial only to your vote banks and are betraying the people. I am not saying this because my shirt is torn or because I’ve been at the receiving end of physical abuse. This assembly is the fruition of many great leaders’ efforts. People such as you are not eligible to be in a reverent place like this. People such as Tanguturi Prakasam, Puchalapalli Sundarayya, Vavilala Gopalakrishnayya Only people like them are eligible to come to a place such as this. Until that happens, this state and this country will never get better. "The world would not change upon your word." "They will never listen to you cries, ever." "Don’t be disheartened." "Cast your net with this water. Don’t put yourself under pressure" "When faith supports you." "When the world is pretending to be asleep." "Your advice here is completely useless." "Don’t be threatened, when your ambitions are strong." "Don’t get tired, your courage will guide you." A leader is someone who makes the Assembly quake in fear. He must threaten them. If necessary, he must face them and fight with them. Instead of attending the colleges, we went around and campaigned for you for a week and made you win the elections as the MLA. Why do you think that is? It’s because we thought you would help us get jobs and help us improve our lives. The one who opens his mouth and shouts in the assembly is seen as the leader. "If you forget, despite knowing everything, what will happen to the world?" Narayana, even this time, you were unable to speak anything at the assembly? And to top it, you were thrashed as well. Didn’t I already tell you? If you elect useless people, this is what will end up happening. He doesn’t know what he should be doing and where. You’ve given power to a useless person, Ramulu. "Come on,. Come on." "You are the one who should be the change first." "Come on,. Come on." "You are the one who should be the change first." "To make things sprout, To make them flower," "Tell me who has the power on the entire earth." "The air and the rain do we have the power to bend them to our will?" "Come on,. Come on." "You are the one who should be the change first." At least now, tell me why do you seem so sad? I’ve lost. I have turned into a useless person who is unable to keep the promise I made to the people. What happened, sir? Why are you saying that? We need to change the political leaders who think they can do anything once they come into power. When that happens, that is when this society will improve. If that’s the case, I will change them. What? You’ll change them? Yes, sir. I will change them. If that’s the case, give me your word. I promise that I will change those political leaders. Change them. You must change them! You must… Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? How is what happened to your father in anyway connected to us? We are public servants. It’s not right to bring us here in this manner and make us go through all these hardships. Public servants? How are you serving the public? Tell me one thing. Even before the month is over, we provide people with rationed food. Every month, we give pension to old aged people and disabled people. We are giving funds to unemployed people. We are doing such good deeds. Aren’t these considered service to the public? Public service doesn’t mean giving rice and lentils, on ration, on time. Why does a 20-year-old unemployed person need funds, sir? Can’t he work? Why would you provide rationed rice to a farmer who has 2 acres of land? Can’t he grow his own rice? Because of your stupid policies and programs, the farmers have lost the capacity to grow food and the system is giving way to laziness. When people finally believe that working hard is better than believing in your free policies and programs, that is when you would truly be doing public service, sir. You mean to say that even though they have no faith in us, the people continue to vote for us? You are Maruthi Rao, aren’t you? Yes. Isn’t your constituency Ramapuram? Yes, it’s Ramapuram. Tell me what you know about your constituency Ramapuram, sir? What’s the big deal about Ramapuram? It’s got four mandals, 6 government hospitals, 20 private hospitals, 12 movie theatres, 130 wine shops. Apart from that the number of voters are … Reddys make up 57,000, Kapus constitute 70,000 voters, the other castes make up one lakh voters. Apart from that, the BCs and SCs constitute 2 lakh voters. Not only that - Director Sukumar and Heroine Anjali were born in my constituency. What more do you need? Nice information, sir. In that very same Ramapuram, earlier, the farmers accounted for thousands of the population there. Yet now, they are in mere hundreds. Do you know why? I don’t know about it. I don’t know anything about my constituency. Tell me what you know. The entire population of voters in Ramapuram is 4,80,000. The men account for 2,50,000. The women account for 2, 28,000. The rest of them are third gender. Since the area experiences high rainfall and high-water supply, the land there is conducive for the cultivation or rice and sugarcane. Coming to the problems that plague the area, there is a huge dumping yard at the main center of Ramapuram town. Given the state of the roads, it would be better to stop talking about them. He is the MLA of a ruling party. You have the right to ask those questions. But we are from the opposition party. Why would you bring us along with them? As an opposition party, you might not have the governmental support. But you have the opportunity to raise your voice in the assembly, don’t you? Why don’t you discuss anything related to the problems in the assembly? The people vote for you and send you to the assembly in the hopes that you would do something good for them. But you don’t care when the petrol prices rise. There is no discussion on the increase in the price of the onions. And the suicides of the farmers merely end up as news without any repercussions. It needs to change. Our way of thinking needs to change. We need to change the way we behave. It’s all well and good to ask us to change. But what about the people?Aren’t they voting for us in exchange for the money that we give them? What are you going to say to them? Who were the ones who taught the public to cast their vote in exchange for money? Wasn’t it the work of you politicians? Not all wish for money to cast their votes. There are people who want justicae for the votes they cast. What do you do? -I am an auto driver. Why are you sticking these posters? Brother Nani deserves such effort. Why is it that you have so much respect for Nani? He is someone who knows our troubles very well. When he comes to power, a lot of people would get jobs. The entire village will prosper. Do you have such faith in that man? Yes, I have a lot of faith in that man. He is someone who fulfills the promises he makes for sure. When our MLA Chinna Kottaiah was arrested, there were protests to free him. As a part of those protests, my husband poured petrol on himself and set himself on ablaze. What did Chinna Kottaiah do? He said that as soon as he comes into power, he would speak to the government and make sure we get some money. Did you make that happen for you? He made a promise, didn’t he? He will uphold his promise for sure. Such kinds of promises that you made have simply become stories and left unfulfilled. At least from now on, please change. Don’t simply change parties to suit your agendas. Follow the plans you promise and change the lives of the people. If you continue to stay the path of buying people’s votes through money and disregarding their welfare, none of you will make it out of here alive. Surya, no matter how much you explain to them, they will never change. They are just going to be the same. Please listen to me and let’s kill all of them. Hey, hold on! Stop that! Brother, if you want to kill us, please go ahead. But before we die, we want to change. Please give us a chance. All these days, we put our attention on how to rob people of their money. But now, if you could give us an opportunity, We will think of ways on how to distribute the wealth back to the people. We will make sure that the dreams of Mr. Narayana Swamy come true. His name is Surya. He is already serving time on a murder case. With the support of the ruling party, he’s managed to coax the authorities in the jail and he’s out of jail. He’s kidnapped the MLAs of both the parties and took them with him. No one other than him knows why he kidnapped those MLAs and to what end. I get it, sir. No matter where he is, I will take up the responsibility of bringing all the MLAs back safely. "There are no boundaries. He is the soldier that no imagination can reach." "The army of people is his Everyone has raised a weapon for you." "Take it…take a step. Stop the games of the evil men." "Challenge…throw a challenge The path you are taking is the history." "There are hundreds of people around you" "Believe us…you are our courage." "It’s enough that you lead us. My brother." "Each step you take is an audience Your word is the Assembly." "Each step you take is an audience Your word is the Assembly." Tell me, Dhruva. Sir, we found the location of the abducted leaders Where? Deep inside the Nallamalla forest. Why delay? Immediately go and catch them "Be ready for the change that’s going to come inside the people" "Lock all the differences of caste and religion." "Sing praises of our land and keep moving forward." "You can clearly see the goal that you have for tomorrow." "He is the master. Master…" 'He is the master. Master…" "Each step you take is an audience Your word is the assembly." Kill them and bring the MLAs. I will take care of whoever interferes. Stop it. Tell me, Dhruva. Looks like they already had information that we would be arriving there. What?! -Yes, sir. He’s taken all the MLAs from here and shifted them elsewhere. So, what do we do now? If I am unable to present the MLAs for the show of the strength test tomorrow, this will turn out to be a big issue in the state. Do whatever is necessary to find out where the MLAs are and bring them to me. Okay, sir. I will try my level best. Here is the file, madam. The signatures of all the MLAs are in this. This is the list of MLAs that support our government, sir. Go ahead. Wish you all the best. -Thank you, sir. Shyamala Bharath, congratulations on being elected the first female chief minister of the state. Best wishes. Thank you. Everyone must agree that the reason why we are seeing the assembly with a changed mindset is because of the good deeds of a single person. To ensure that we work for the betterment of the public, there must be harmony between the members of the assembly. I request the opposition party to put forward the problems of the people that have come to their attention. Honorable speaker, on the very first day that the session of the assembly commenced, the Chief Minister has given the opportunity to the government to speak first. I, as well as our political party, thank the Chief Minister and the honorable speaker. For the past two years, we all know the effects that the pandemic of Covid wreaked on the public. It’s is time for us to wake up to the issues of public health. I request on the behalf of the opposition that the government must take steps to address the issues of the public health, especially the poor. I request the Chief Minister, Shyamala Bharath to speak on this issue. I appreciate Mr. Ram Mohan Rao and his party for creating a harmonious atmosphere in the assembly where we can work towards public welfare, and also for putting forward a bill for the betterment of public health. Corporate health facilities for even a common man. Even if the cost is a mere ten rupees or even ten lakhs. With the objective of providing good healthcare, I am signing into effect the first policy of my term, in front of all of you, your honor. Surya, at last, you have achieved what you set out to do. What are your plans next? All those who are hindering the progress of our country are going to be my next target. "There are no boundaries. He is the soldier that no imagination can reach." "The army of people is his Everyone has raised a weapon for you." "Take it…take a step. Stop the games of the evil men." "Challenge…throw a challenge The path you are taking is the history." "There are hundreds of people around you" "Believe us…you are our courage." "It’s enough that you lead us. My brother." "Each step you take is an audience Your word is the Assembly." "Each step you take is an audience Your word is the Assembly." "Be ready for the change that’s going to come inside the people" "Lock all the differences of caste and religion." "Sing praises of our land and keep moving forward." "You can clearly see the goal that you have for tomorrow." "He is the master. Master…" 'He is the master. Master…"
