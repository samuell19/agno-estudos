[MUSIC PLAYING] [EVIL LAUGHTER] MAN: Don't tell me it's no god damn pottery class. Nobody takes pottery class at 3:00 AM. It wasn't 3:00 AM. It was more like 11 o'clock at night. I don't give a shit if it's high noon. When I get home from the office, I want you in the house. Hey. Am I making sense here? - It's not-- it's not like that. - No, see? See, that's bullshit. Fine. You want me to leave? I'll move out. Oh, no, baby, come on. I don't want you to move out. [SOBBING] Listen, babe. I'm going to go out for a while, OK? So why don't you clean the place up? It's a mess. [SPOOKY MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hello? Is anybody home? Hello? [EVIL LAUGHTER] [MUMBLING] Stevie? Hold on a second. I have a [MUMBLING]. The door was open, so I just came in. Oh, yeah, I guess the door knob's broke again. That's the god damn landlord for ya. [DOG BARKING OUTSIDE] Are we going to shoot this? No, that's a wrap. Oh, gotcha, Stevie. Annie! Hey! Where have you been? You vanished on us for a little while there. Yeah, seven months. Thanks for calling, friend. What's going on with the Halloween costume? What's with the sunglasses after dark? You first. Oh, my god, Annie. Jesus Christ. Looks like you fell down a flight of abusive boyfriends. I was going to get around to it, OK? It was Burke, wasn't it? I didn't have anywhere else to go. Yesterday, he got sort of mad, and I-- Well, you're staying here, OK? You know, maybe we should call the police. - No. - What do you mean no? We're going to put that asshole away for life. Guys, it's just a bruise. He's never done it before. It just scared me, that's all. I packed up all my stuff. I tore out of there. I don't want to go to court or go through all that crap with the police or see his face again. That's not even an option. That's right, kiddo. This place is more than big enough for the three of us, OK? And you're going to stay here till you get your head put on straight. Thanks, you guys. Before I unpack, though, please tell me what's going on with the Lily Munster look. It's witchcraft, baby. Boo! [LAUGHTER] Annie, where you at? Annie? Shit. How much? Well, let's see. This is good for the divorce papers. OK. And this is good for when you catch your boyfriend sleeping with the Hooters waitress. And this is good for when you catch him walking around in your bra and panties. (TOGETHER) Bra and panties! So she just ran off and hopped in the shower without explaining herself. What's up with the weird get up? Are you guys starting a cult or something? Are you familiar with the Cal Berkeley grant? Nope. OK. That's for women in film. Anyway, she got it about, I would say, three months ago. She quit her day job. Stevie got financing? Good old Stevie. Uh oh. What did I do? I was just telling her about the grant. So what? Are you guys making a horror film or something? No, it's a documentary on witchcraft. We were shooting the wrap around when you showed up. Let me guess. Cross-dressing boyfriend, right? Cheers. Absolutely. So this stuff is all just props. Yeah, for the most part. The costumes, the fake blood, the knife. You're still into all that weird stuff? It's still cool, OK? Drink up. If it's too weird, you're too sober. I bet you didn't know where the whole riding the broomsticks thing comes from. I'm sure you're going to tell me. Uh huh. Well, a long time ago, the first witches in the covens back in England, who were doing really exciting experiments with hallucinogenics, they would take this sort of LSD balm, and they found the most effective way of applying it was through-- Oh, Christ. Thank you. Yes, it's true. See, they would lather up the balm on the end of a broom stick and sort of-- Thanks for sharing. It's true. Ask Rose. Oh, no. Don't ask Rose. At least not until the drinks are finished. Cheers. You guys are awesome. You know that? Huh uh. We just drank this way too fast. Next time we cut it down to creepy first date, and we check your strength, OK? We've got a shoot tomorrow. Hey, what are you shooting? Going up to the Renaissance festival or some dumb thing. No. It's a Wiccan thing. It's the summit. You're totally drunk. Whatever. I'm going to interview witches, OK? - Real witches? - Yeah. They have covens. They make potions. They go the whole nine yards. They believe it's real, anyway. Oh, my god. They actually have people like that? Yeah. That's the basis for my whole documentary. People really do practice witchcraft. It's big business. So I just want to know, why is it that people find it fascinating? What do they like about it? Why do they want to know about curses and casting spells and all that shit? They actually, like, turn people into frogs and fly around and stuff? No. That's the whole argument, is that you can't turn people into frogs, so why waste your life trying to do it? So what is it? Is it fun? Are the clothes cool? Is bingo night full? We're going to do it. Right now. - Do what? Oh, no. Huh uh. Huh uh. It is way too late, and I am way too drunk. Rose, come on. It's going to be fun. Wake up. What are you guys talking about? There's three of us. It's perfect. Three? Yes. Everything in magic is threes. You end your votives with 3 times 3 times 3. There's the holy trinity, the three wise men. Three's company. - Rose. - I'm sorry. The whole idea is dumb. No, this is great. This is going to be great, because we're going to videotape the ritual. I can use this. Are you serious? I'm serious as a frickin' heart attack. All right. Can you at least let me get some pants on? No, you look terrific. Stevie, is this something bad? Define bad. Human sacrifice, the exorcist. We're just going to read from this book. I got it from a friend of mine. He does antiquing up in Covington County. What is that? It's a book. It's a book of spells. We're going to have to mic this from the camera. Damn it. You're not going to dress up like that witch again, are you? Shh. Girl at work here. OK. Let me guess. Those aren't aromatherapy therapy candles. Pretend I don't know anything about witchcraft. What's the white candle for? This is our travel candle. This is what we focus on during the ritual, right into the flame. And the black one? This is for protection. Protection from what, Stevie? You never know. Evil spirits, demons, trolls. - OK. You know what? Rose's right. Let's just forget this. Annie, this is just a ritual. It's just like communion. We light the candles, and we just go with the flow. Nothing's going to happen. - Yeah? Then why is that candle behind you? It protects the whole god damn room, OK? Can we just get on with this? Um, we're not going to have to cut our palms or anything, are we? Annie, they, don't really do that, OK? Our link is the fire. And then what? Then I read, and you help me concentrate. I call upon forces greater than mine, the mother of Earth and mistress of time. Spirits, guide me fast and true. Bid thy task, I ask of you. Give unto thee thy demons' fire, and grant us all our heart's desire. What just happened to the lights? I don't know. Maybe the beach line's down. Damn it. The camera's on battery. It's a low light, so don't worry about it. Everything's OK. This is actually perfect. Stevie-- Annie, look into the fire. I need you guys to help me on this part. I call upon thy sacred name. I call upon thy sacred name. I call upon thy sacred name. Repeat it to the fire. (TOGETHER) I call upon thy sacred name. I call upon thy sacred name. I call upon thy sacred name. I invoke thee on thy sacred name. I invoke thee on thy sacred name. I invoke thee on thy sacred name. (TOGETHER) I invoke thee on thy sacred name. I invoke thee on thy sacred name. I invoke thee on thy sacred name. By the flame before thee, I speak thy name. (TOGETHER) I speak thy name. Thy name is Lilith. [EVIL LAUGHTER] Stevie, what's happening? Guys, everyone out now! [BREATHING HARD] - What was that? I don't know. It sounded like it came from under the house. I think was a storm. Hello? Notice something? No thunder, clear skies. What do you want me to tell you? What about those lights? Something was in there with us. It's that book. That book. That book did something. Yeah, that's right. It's this book. It's from Salem. Over 300 years old, used to raise demons and cast spells. Except for one thing. I bought it at Pan Pipes in Riverton a week ago. It's a gag gift. I got it for $3. It was either this or the satanic Bible. It's all bullshit. Oh, yeah? Well, then, what about the ritual? I'm good with rhymes. I do it all the time. Come on. Don't get mad. I just wanted to prove a point. Yeah, like what? You need Zoloft? Like it's all in your head. Yeah? Because you looked pretty god damn scared back there. You know what? We were all there. We all heard it. We all saw it. Right? Sweetheart, we are drunk. OK? We probably just psyched ourselves out. Power outage, right? Yeah. It's a power outage. [BUZZER SOUNDING] Jesus Christ. Oh, god. Should have slept in my bed last night. My body feels like it was beat by a sack of quarters. Ugh. It's the rum. Yeah? Well, sign me up for AA. Time to get up, booze-hens. - Oh, coffee. - Wakey, wakey, wakey. Thank you. Rise and shine. Oh, yeah. You're awesome, Stevie. I don't care what they write about you on bathroom walls. Say, what the hell are you so perky for? Yeah. You had just as much to drink as we did. I have a steel liver. What are you doing over there? I have to hustle over to Baker Street. I want to bump into some witches at that festival. It's a convention. Whatever. Hoping to get some decent footage. You want to come? - Yeah. Um, what about that? What? The footage you shot last night. I didn't even look at it. Don't you think you should? It's probably not even usable. Come on. Hurry up. Let's go. Get in the shower. Let's go. I've got to pack the car. OK. Maybe I'll be awake by then. I think we should watch it. Why? Because there might be something on it. Besides three drunk chicks saying spooky shit to a candle? No. Because maybe the camera picked up sound or the lights we saw. What do you care, anyway? You don't even believe in this shit. You think I did it? Gee, I can't imagine why. Look. All I'm saying is that I think that we should tell Annie it's all a joke. Hands off. I'm not finished. I've got to pack the car. Oh, man. Christ, I have to stop drinking. That's bad. Blah. Oh, well. What are you going to do? [HUMMING] What? Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. It's so stupid. What am I doing? (SINGING) I'm going crazy at 25. Doo be doo bop be doo bop. Crazy at 25. Do do do do dah. Wow. So you do this all the time, huh? Yep. You should have seen it at Halloween. It was fucking crazy. I can't believe people are into this stuff. - What, witchcraft? - Yeah. I mean, you think witches and black cats. You think Wizard of Oz. Ah, familiars. That's what witches call cats. They're like servants and demons that take animal form. Oh, my god. You are really into this stuff. Well, I'm not exactly a witch or anything, but I think it's fascinating. Are you OK? Rose said I really fucked with your head last night. Did I? Well, Stevie, it was pretty scary. I know. We should've just slept it off. Everything would have been fine. Well, I know we probably just freaked ourselves out, but what about the camera footage from last night? We're not using that footage. It was a dumb idea, right? You ever had a Fatburger? - Fatburger? Mm hm. You have not lived until you've had a Fatburger. I will buy you one. I am starving. Fatburger. What you doing? Well, seeing I can't afford a digital deck, I have to hook the camera up to the VCR so I can see my dailies. Dailies? It's raw footage. Yeah. And you better put it back the way you found it. Last time, you left 17 channels of porn on my cable box. So? So it was in Spanish. Anyway, how was your day with Stevie? Did she go into pit boss mode? I got to hold the microphone. Hey, how come she got to hold the microphone? Talk to the ass. Speaking of which, it's in my view, OK? Hey, are we going to watch the whole thing? No, just the end. The wind picked up during the last interview, so I got to check the audio. MAN: I don't know. The more shit you hear about it, yeah, I'm getting closer to believing in it. How did you get this footage? From Freaks R Us? MAN: I think so. I mean, it's a little town-- [GARBLED SPEECH ON RECORDING] I knew it. It's the god damn microphone. Where's it at? I put it in your room. Battery is dead. Hold on. MAN: You got your drunk drivers and your farming accidents. Well, I didn't-- - Keep watching. Let me know if there's any drop back. Huh? Let me know if anything looks fucked up. MAN: Yeah. Those are the two options, pretty much. And I think-- (RECORDING) I call upon thy sacred name. I call upon thy sacred name. Hey, that's the stuff from last night. Hey! You taped over the spook stuff. STEVIE: Hold on, OK? (RECORDING) I invoke thee on thy sacred name. I invoke thee on thy sacred name. I invoke thee on thy sacred name. I invoke thee on thy sacred name. (RECORDING) By the flame before thee, I speak thy name. I speak thy name. - What's going on? This is the part when the lights go out. Come on. - Come on, you guys. Give it a rest. - Come on, man. Sit down, will you? (RECORDING) Thy name is Lilith. Hey, what are you doing? This thing got slow mo? (RECORDING) Stevie, what's happening? What, Rose is it? See that? That's a head. Oh, my god. It's a ghost image. - A ghost? Yeah, it's a ghost. Come on, you guys. The erase head on the camera's all munched up, OK? The camera is probably just picking up the TV transmission. That is not a TV transmission. That's the lights we saw last night. So what is it? I don't know. You tell me. I did tell you. The camera is broke. Come back to Earth, Rose. You know, I really hate it when you guys fight. I'm going to go for a walk. I told you. I want you to knock it the hell off, man. You see what it does to her. You are the one who's going on about the fucking ghost. Man, why don't you tell her you were screwing around with the lights? I wasn't, OK? [GASPING] What is it? What the hell? What are you looking at me for? I'm the one who put the security deposit down on this place. The last thing I'm going to do is start finger painting on the walls. You know, you were the last one to leave the room before Annie. Maybe Annie-- No. I didn't do it. Nobody's saying you did it. Are they? I'll go get a rag and clean this up, OK? I didn't mean to cause you guys any trouble. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] It's times like these that make you feel so crazy. Look at what you thought you had. Just can't seem to face it. The things you love can make you mad. It's my turn to make you feel the pain. It's my turn to give you what you asked for. It's my turn to make you feel some shame. It's my turn to turn you inside out. It's my turn to make you feel the pain. It's my turn. [BELL TOLLING] Stevie, what are you doing here? [EVIL LAUGHTER] Call the police. Come on! Call the police. What? Somebody's in my room. Did you see them? It was dark. Shit. What are you doing, man? Call the police. I'll take care of this. [STAIRS CREAKING] (WHISPERING) The bed. Look under the bed. There's no one here. How do you think he got in? It wasn't through the windows. I don't think it was a guy. What's going on? Someone was in my room, and they jumped me. Oh, my god. Rose, no one was here. No one came out of the room, and there's no other place they could-- [CREAKING NOISES OVERHEAD] That's a raccoon or a squirrel or possum or something like that. Man, it's no raccoon. OK? What I saw was a full sized human being, and it jumped me. OK, Rose. I get it. Now just take it down a notch. Whatever is was, what are we going to do about it? Man, you know what? I'm not going up there. I'm done for tonight. I get to get up at the crack of dawn and do work in my office before the staff gets there. We'll just close off this room. I'll call pest control in the morning, and they'll handle it. [MUSIC PLAYING] I used to think fame was my destiny. I let my pipe dreams get the best of me. I need them now. I'm coming down. Don't believe a spoken melody into the darkness of our dreams. Been there in fire with the earthquakes down below. The foolish hearts and fantasies. Don't turn around. Who are you? I was in your bed last night. Oh, god. Oh, god. I'll be there tonight, as well. Maybe you and I will have a talk then. No, please. Whatever we did, I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything. I swear. I swear. I swear. You meant everything. Every word. That's why I'm here. What do you want? I'm here to punish some bad little girls for playing with fire. Maybe you will go first. I haven't decided. I just want you to remember witches burn. [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't believe a spoken melody into the darkness of our dreams. Been there in fire with the earthquakes down below. Jesus Christ. Yesterday you couldn't throw a rock without hitting a witch. I don't get it. I know. They're hiding. I'll have to interview construction workers again. Well, Stevie, maybe we should just call it a day. I have to get the footage, OK? You didn't get any sleep last night, did you? Rose is driving me nuts, OK? She's going over the edge. Between that message on the kitchen wall and that stuff about the ghost and that thing in the room. Annie, think about it. It's not good. What do you think it is? I don't know. It's not me. Are you sure you're not messing around with your old buddies, Annie? Why would you say that? Well, it's a little bit of a coincidence, don't you think? I mean, you come to town. Shit hits the fan. I'm sorry. It's not you. OK? I know it's not you. But I know it's not me. And Rose is just too squirrely for it to be her. So what is it? Bingo. Living dead girl at nine o'clock. Go. Go. Come on. Let's go. Pull over. Pull over. Pull over right here. Stop the car. Go. Go. Go. Pull over. Over, over. Wait! Wait! You want to be in a documentary? Miss? Hello? Hello? Miss? Fuck. Oh, shit. God damn it. God damn it. LILITH: I've decided to stop playing with you. Stop looking. [EVIL LAUGHTER] Neat trick. LILITH: You liked my message? What message? The one I left for you on the kitchen wall. Do I know you? I'm someone who has been watching you for a long time. Great. Why don't you come on out, then? I will. I might save you for last, though. I think you need special attention. After all, you're the one who started the fire. Jesus Christ. What are you doing? Fucking going crazy. Did you see that weird looking goth chick walk in here? Uh, no. I didn't see anybody come in here but you. OK. Stevie, what's going on here? Why you asking me? Because all this witch crap is your deal. I didn't see anything, Stevie. OK, this is bullshit. I sat here, and I tried to tell you guys, maybe the power went out. But you attacked me. You said you saw the spawns of Satan. Now I'm trying to tell you guys, I saw-- God knows what it was that I saw out there, and then you guys are coming down on me. Oh, yeah. The whole world is against you. - Well, it might as well be. - Why? Don't you get it? This is my fault. I brought this down on us. I think we formed a coven the other night. Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowgirl. First you had me. Then you lost me. You said that stuff was all made up. It-- it was. It's just-- it's perception versus reality. OK? The intent was there. I think that we believed in what we were doing so much that we brought this weird shit down on our heads. No, Stevie. No, no, no, no. We tapped into something. You know we did. Look, you had us going. We got scared. But that's it. That's all. Rose and I saw the same person. Yeah, we did. We saw the same person on videotape, and we both had a dream about her. It's a little weird, but-- All of a sudden you're Ms. Practical? I thought someone attacked you in your room last night. Yeah, I was. And I think I know who did it. Who? I think it was Burke. Burke? Burke's wearing a black dress. Man, I'm not even going to go there. I don't think even Burke would do something like this. Sure he would. He follows Annie here. He gets all pissed off because we take her in. He's probably just trying to scare us. I'm going to pull a Rose here. It was no god damn Burke. I'm not saying it was magic. I'm just saying that I think we believe in this stuff a little bit too much. Then how do we stop believing? That I don't know. [MUSIC PLAYING] I've traveled the longest road, and it seemed to me I'd been hiding for too long. You set me free. Like a story being told to me, one look in your eyes, and I knew it would have to be. Now we go our ways-- [MUSIC PLAYING] It's times like these that make you feel so crazy. Look at what you thought you had. Over and over, you just can't seem to face it. - Hi, Burke. - Hey. Ow. Ah. Hello, Burke. Come on. Try for me again, and I'll drop kick your nose through your ass. I swear to god. I wasn't trying to hurt you. Oh, no, no, no. That was just one of those friendly jump a female jogger on the beach scenarios, right? My mistake. - Ow. I didn't want Annie to see me. No shit. It's been your MO for the last couple of days, hasn't it, Burke? What? What? You know what's funny? Is that I used to think you were a prick, OK? I didn't think you were an asshole enough to drive all the way up here and cause all this trouble for us. The hell are you talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about. It'll take me 10 minutes to jog home, 15 minutes to call the cops, and a half an hour to make a report. You've got a stop watch? - All right. All right. Fine. I'm leaving. Come on. I have to tell you something. - Call me from jail. - OK. All right. Fine. Go ahead. Call the cops. I got to tell you something about Annie. What about Annie? What about Annie? What are you going to say, you fucking love her? MAN: Of course I do. Then why did you hit her? What are you talking about? Pull that candy cane out of your fucking asshole, all right? You left a fucking knuckle sandwich on her face. Oh, Jesus. What is she telling you, huh? I hit her? Is that what she said? I never hit her. Of course not. You're not violent. Look. Look. A couple of days ago, we're sitting around the apartment. [CRASHING SOUND] - Honey? Annie? What are you doing? Who's this? Stevie and Rose. I know them? Honey, do you want me to call the doctor? They'll figure it out. Honey, look, I need to call an ambulance. You're not well. - Don't. [EVIL LAUGHTER] She left. I don't even know why I let her leave the room, let alone drive off like that. I followed her out here. Well, guess what, Burke? I think you're making all this up just to save your own ass or to scare me. No, I'm not making this up. You've got to get her to a hospital. You leave one more love note like that on my kitchen wall, and I will personally show you why you don't hit girls, Burke. I promise. Fine. You don't have to believe me. Will you just please keep an eye on her? Please? Fuck. [EVIL LAUGHTER] Hey! [EVIL LAUGHTER] [COUGHING] Where's Stevie? She went jogging. Looks like she left us something on the camera. Really? What the hell is this shit? He looks so scared. No, this has to be a fucking joke. No. Look at his face. There's no way he could fake that. [GAGGING] Oh, my god. He's dead. Sweetheart-- Was it Stevie? Was it her? She's the only one that knows how to operate the camera. I think she snapped. Why would she do that? I don't know. Maybe this stuff is real for her now. Oh, my god, Stevie. I know. I love her, too. What do we do now? What if she comes back? We're not sticking around to find out. I have to get my car keys, and then we're out of here. - What if she didn't do it? - What? I don't care if Bob the murderer flew in from Ohio and did it, OK? We're calling the cops. Now, you stay here. Rose, I'll go with you. Wait. No. You stay here. You keep an eye out on the house. You understand? If Stevie comes, you run. You want me to leave you alone after what we just saw? OK, if anything weird goes down, there's not going to be much of me to be left behind. Stevie? [SCREAMING] Rose. [CRYING] [STAIRS CREAKING] [CRYING] [GASPING] (SOBBING) I found her like this. What-- - Annie. - No. You stay away from me. You killed her. (SOBBING) No! No! No. I was jogging on the beach. I was looking for you guys. It's you. You killed Burke, and you killed her. I saw you! I saw you come in here. What? Annie! - No, no! - Annie! Annie! Get away from me. I didn't do it. You got to believe me, Annie. Like hell. Just calm down, OK? We got to get some help, all right? See, I'm here. Nothing is going to happen now. - Hm. (RECORDING) [SCREAMING] You should see your face, Stevie. You really should. How could you? Oh, I'm not your Annie. But I think you know that. And you kicked Burke in the balls for nothing. He was telling the truth. [SNORING] I knew she'd be the easiest way in. She led me right to you. Why are you doing this to us? Why cast spells on a stormy night? Why ask for demons and power if you aren't ready to pay the penalty? Any witch knows that. Even a fake one. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Lilith Le Fay. What the hell is going on? Oh, you thought I didn't remember how my dear old friend spent that night of passion with the man of my dreams, did you? All because I worked late one night, and you two come over, shitfaced drunk. At first, I thought it was just Burke being a typical, pathetic man, having two sluts shake their tits in his face. When he confessed to me what happened, I couldn't even believe it. My two best friends and my boyfriend? I'm sorry, Annie. We just wanted to get you away from Burke. Why? Why would you do that? Why would you want to take me away from the one thing that made me happy? Because we wanted you back, Annie. When you met Burke, it just-- it all happened so far, and before we knew it, you moved in with him, and we never saw you again. I was happy, Stevie. Can't you understand that? Burke was everything to me. He was everything. He was everything I ever wanted and needed. What about us? Your friends? - No. If you were really my friends, you would have supported my decision instead of acting like a couple of jealous bitches. No, Annie. Everything we did, we did because we were your friends. Can't you see that? - No. No, I can't. I tried. I tried to forget about what happened. I tried to forget that Burke did what he did. I just-- no, I couldn't. I just couldn't. And killing Rose? Is that the answer? No. I knew-- I knew you were in all that weird shit. [EVIL LAUGHTER] You cast a spell on Burke, so I decided to cast a spell of my own. Jesus, Annie. You are so pathetic. If you feel like we wronged you, the least you could do was get your hands dirty. Do you really need Double Ugly over here? You never confronted us about what happened with Burke. No matter much we apologized, you just ran and is scared into your little shell. I thought I taught you better than that, Annie. Why don't you do the right thing and kick our asses instead of going straight to Lizzie Borden mode? You always were the weakest of the trio. Don't touch me. Come on. Get up. You want revenge for what I did? Now come on. Dish it up. I can take it. You killed my friend. You killed Rose. [SCREAMING] The least you could do is say you're sorry. I'm sorry. That's better. [GROANING] You bitch. You ain't even worth it. You've got spunk. I like that in a lady. If you're going to waste me, do it right now. Otherwise, go fuck yourself, witch. What if I told you I had something else in mind for you? Keep talking. Hi. This will be my final installment for the documentary. My closing arguments, I guess. What is witchcraft, and why do we still practice it? I think it's because we're all afraid of the dark. That's my final word. But I have one word of warning for you. No matter how many lights you make, no matter how modern you become, there will always be dark, and there will always be something to be afraid of in the dark. I've got to run now. I was worried before that the police would come after me after what happened to Rose and Burke, but that's just not happening now. Things have changed. So I've answered my own question here, then. Now I know what witchcraft is. [EVIL LAUGHTER] It starts with a fire. [EVIL LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] When you were young, you learned to hate. That's all they ever gave in the cold and barren place. Under the grave and cool the sky, only time was on your side, and only fantasies they're having. Still a child when you took wing to trade your misery for fame and the fate. But when you wake up, you'll find your own road. Because all that little girl ever needed was a home. Ooh, baby. Ooh, baby. The dream is over. The dream is over.
