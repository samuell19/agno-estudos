Aw, crap. Oh, hello. Thought you could sneak away from me, huh? Nice try. But you are gloves, and you must submit to my human hands. Oh, God, I've really gotta get out of here, for real. What the hell are you? Radio announcer: Good morning, Pangnirtung. It's the longest day of the year and what a beautiful one. We're celebrating with the Solstice dance tonight at the community hall. Doors open at seven music by, and his nephew Joe. Can't, sorry. Gotta go! This is the money my mom gave me for washing Hondas every day, and I only get a quarter a week, so it took me 60 weeks to get this $15. There is nothing in Pang to spend $15 on. It's almost like having nothing. Maybe I'll get a cell phone. You can't get a cell phone for $15. They cost way more than that. And plus, where are you going to get it? Maybe I'll get it from Nelson's brother. He won't talk to you, you're too little. And as I told you, $15 can't buy you anything. You don't know about money, but that's okay. Still, if you can give me that $15, I could take care of all the complicated stuff. And since you added money to pay for my phone, I'm willing to make a deal that says you can maybe use it sometimes. Then can I hang out with you? You could hang out with me during break periods when we've agreed you could use my phone. But you can't call long distance, and you cannot use my data. This is a great deal for you. What are you doing? Uki, you didn't just take that little chick's money, did you? I'm not a little chick. I only gave her the money so I can share cell phones together. Give that shit back. No! What? Hey! It was a good deal! So what are you up to later? Guess I'll come. Hey, you guys see that girl in Arviat that harpooned that fat-ass whale? Yeah, that was cool. - Ugh, I hate fishing. - She probably got lucky. Plus, her dad probably did most of the work. You just called out Cameron V. Chick is wearing John Anderson's hoody in that pic, and just yesterday, she told me he was trash. You're vicious on Insta. Meat for sale! Yo, is that your dad? Ugh, let's go for a ride on the boat. - By ourselves? - Yeah. No way, not allowed. Oh yes, we have to. Plus, we have to! We could drive out to the cabins. Lee Lee, it will be super fun. That's fun with additional fun on top. - Come on. - Fine. Yes! I'll go home and get the keys. TV news anchor: And that's it for me. Back to you and Tia. Second anchor: In other Arctic news, there has been an update in the evolving case of a missing researcher. A pack containing equipment that was hand-mended, and field guides have recently washed up on the shores of Pangnirtung, are believed to belong to the missing geologist, Tony Konk. Konk, an American geologist from the University of Connecticut... ...was getting snow samples outside the isolated campus. Konk has been missing for... Wait! No way. That chick said if I give her my 15, we get to hang out together. Hurry, we're gonna get in trouble. Someone's gonna tell parents. We're good. Chill, chill. Go get pop-chips-coco. Me and that one made a deal, so you have to take me with you, because that's how deals work. Shut up, you're not old enough to make deals. I can make deals if I want to! Better grab this money before the water gets it. I'll tell mom you're taking the boat out. I'll tell mom I caught you eating that stick of butter in the middle of the night. Your At a at a know you're taking the boat out? - Yep, no problem. - Yes, sir! Look at all those stupid birds. Circling like place like it's a big garbage dump. I like watching it get smaller. If we drove far enough, it would just disappear. So they're like, trying to shock this guy to life. And his belly turns into a mouth with effed up monster teeth. And the teeth chomp the other guy's arm off. And then the main guy lights that on fire, but it only makes the guy whose belly split open's neck grow long, until eventually... Pop! Off with his head. And the only way you can tell if it was a human or an alien was by burning its blood. The main guy got so crazy he burned the whole thing down to ashes. That's whack. - You want to hear a true story? - Yeah. You know the Kattuk boy that went missing last spring? Yeah. Well, Brenda was talking to Billy Mike, and Billy Mike was talking to a fisherman from Iqaluit, and he said that he saw the boy playing by the water. And then, like, a fog rolls in. And out comes a grey head, with long black hair. And you know what happens next? What? He snatches the boy and drags him into the water. Qalupalik. Get out of here with that silly Inuk shit. Stacey hates Drew now. By far the cruddiest boyfriend I've ever had. - Worst two days of my life. - How much data do you have? Dunno, my parents pay for it. Are your guys's parents going to the dance tonight? Everyone's parents are going. All the parents will go and get pissy-drunk and then come home and we'll have to deal with them. My Dad's scary when he's drunk. Yeah, welcome to Crap Hole. Population, who cares? Pang? What other crap hole are you living in? I think Pang is awesome. Sorry you like crap so much. Maybe it's just crap wherever you go. Whatever, everywhere in Pang is ghetto. So ghetto. I'm gonna move to Winnipeg and forget about all these lame Inuk problems. This chick gets to go to Winnipeg every year. I know. Lucky. Thomassie Tiktak just got a Honda. It's a nice one. How do you know? He take you for a ride on it? Not even! I'm just saying. Those things are sketchy as hell, I'd never get on one. Bet you can't shoot that can. I could, easy. My Dad taught me shooting. He can shoot seal when they're just tiny dots way off. - Thought so. - Shut up! - Let me shoot, then. - As if. Don't be such a wimp about it. Look, I don't got all the bullets in the world for you to be blasting off everywhere. Yeah, little miss John McClane. Who's that, Manitok's cousin? Oh my God. Hey. Hey! It's not fair that other people can't shoot 'cause you're a chicken. Uh, my gun means I decide what's fair. It's coming closer! You guys! What is it? - - I don't know! - What is it?! Shh! It's a bear. Bear?! Oh God, our parents are going to kill me! Shh, just stay still. Guys, what are we... Told ya, I'm a good shot. Oh my God, Uki! Hah! Knew you chicks was out here! Aju! Oh, shit! Guys! Guys! Aju, run! Run! Maika! Okay, come on! Aju! Aju! Come on... Come on, guys! Come on! Hurry! Aju, run! Maika, come on! You've got this! Shoot it now! Aju, run! Shoot! Shoot it! Hurry! Maika, shoot! Uki, come on! Aju! Aju! Aju! Oh my God, oh my God! Aju, wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Aju! Oh my God. Come on, come one. Let's get out of here. Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Come on. - What was that? That was so scary, I thought you were dead. Aju, are you hurt? Wash this gunk off. It's not coming off. See how it moved? It didn't move right. And its blood was black. And its face was messed! Like, dead. Maybe it was just effed up with rabies or something. Uh-uh, that's not what effed up with rabies looks like. That's not even what a bear looks like. My bike is still out there. It was like, pee-your-pants scary. It's just a bunch of blurs! It's a crazy bear thing. It grabbed Aju. - What? - It ran away with me. Get out of here. Go play with the kids down there. Yeah, they wish. Thomassie You kill that shit? - I shot it first. - Yeah. That's why it came after us in the first place. Doy. Sounds cray. Totally cray. Cray-cray. But like, what was it? Ijiraq. Ijiraq tried to take me? It was not Ijiraq. Don't even. What was it then? It was just an effed up bear. What makes an Ijiraq? Shape-shifting, children stealing. What did this thing do? Pretend to be a bear and steal Aju. Ijiraq. That's Inuk nonsense. There's no Ijiraq, no Sedna, and no Qalupalik. Just stupid old people stories made up because they didn't have internet yet. What's an Ijiraq? Ijiraq are things that live in two worlds. Two worlds? If you go far enough north, there's a whole other world. If you go far enough north, you'll start going south. When Ijiraq comes to our world, they can disguise themselves as anything, and when they do, they snatch children and bring them back to their world. Why do they take children? 'Cause it makes no sense, it's dumb Inuk stuff. And only dumb Inuit fall for it now. You think you know all that, but it's only people who think they know all that who really don't know anything. Ask your At a at a, he'll tell you. The great hunter. Feel free to shut up about my dad. Hey, since you know so much and you're such a good little Inuk anyway, why don't you go out there and hunt that thing with all your great skills? Then you can come back and prove us all wrong. Seriously, I dare you. Go out there. Officer - Who's smoking what out here?! Huh? Tiktak. Some big wheels you got. Where's your helmet? Aww, don't give me that stoic stare. I might lose myself in those dreamy eyes. Officer - Lefebvre, leave the kids alone. They're smoking out here. Big Honda man here doesn't have his helmet. Lefebvre, just go. That's an order. Hey, so what are you doing later? I'm having a few people over, you should come by. Can we all come? Yeah, sure. - Text in a bit? - Yeah. - Go to Thomassie's together? - Yeah. Later, chica. Don't say a peep to mom and dad about us being out there today. And hide that blood. What if they ask about my bike? They're not going to ask about your bike. Ruh-roh! - Hi, At a at a. - Hi. Around. So your thing is you don't want An a an a to go out? We were coming home, but this real doy, Johnny Lampe, was making trouble for all the kids, but Maika got him to stop, and because he's scared of Maika, he stopped. Oh, wow, isn't that great of Maika. Why don't you tell Maika she is supposed to be helping An a an a before she goes off helping everybody in Pang? Sorry. Hey, you and you. And me and me? My toy. An a an a? Oh, okay. Okay. Thanks. - Hi, Leena. - Hi. Why are you home so late? Who were you with? Jess. I see you guys were out on the land today. You're grounded. - How long? - A month. It's dangerous to go out on the land without an adult. Don't you young ladies know that? Dude, you have to. Thomassie! Hottest guy in school. - Can't. - Why? Your parents aren't home. Because she has to sit me. You can go to Maika's with Aju. No. Lee Lee will let you watch Netflix in her room for a month. Uh-uh. You can have my phone case. Fine. Hey, girlfriend. - Hey. - Hi. - Sorry you got grounded. - Yeah. Your parents are always in your business. But I was the one that was like, "Let's go in the boat," which is just so dumb. It doesn't matter anyway. I mean, she's out now. Hey, we're on our way. - - Bye, An a an a. - Bye, sweetie. - - Bye, At a at a. - Love you all, be good. Okay, wanna go out? Yeah. Uh, I don't think so. You're staying. No way. Nice try, chica. Alashua will stay with you, right? No way, I'm going out with you guys. No, actually you're staying or I'll tell the reason your new stretchy pants went missing was because you pooped yourself on Shooyook's trampoline and then buried them in the field by the school. Good. Later, poopy. And purple, and dark... What the hell is that? The guy from the dock? Eww, what's that smell? Like expired yogurt. Shut up. I like it. Who's it for? - No one. - Really? Really! Crap, what the hell. Sometimes I wear perfume when I'm like, hanging at home alone. It makes me feel fresh. She's fresh for sure. Give it up. Shall we call on this chick? I'm not going in. Aye-aye, her scares me. I'll get her. Hey, Granny. Sanaugaq, tell An a an a to come over and give Granny some company. She's going to the dance tonight. Granny used to dance so good! What about you? You babysit for Granny? Where's Uki? Ah, Jesus. That girl disappeared on me. Now Granny can't go out anymore. Uki disappeared? Nami? Here, and then not here. She's supposed to babysit for Granny. A space ship? What the... What do you need his blood for? - Where is she? - I don't know. Should we go after her? She could be anywhere, doing any stupid thing. Dude, you were like, "I dare you" in front of everyone. Not our problem, we didn't make her. I know, but she's crazy. She can get into trouble out there. Nothing against Uki but no way I'm going back out there. Exactly, she's always dragging us into her Inuk shit. So, wanna go to Thomassie's? He's only TNT because he's the bomb. Oh. You guys are gross. This place is like a ghost town. Because of a square dance. For real, lame. It's kinda spooky though. Should we just go in? Yeah. Why not? Okay. Guys, this is so cool. Who's that girl sitting beside Kendall? I think it's Wesley Oonark's sister. What's up? - What's up? - I just asked you. Oh. Nothing. - I brought Jess. - Yeah, hey, Nothing. I mean... nothing. Do you guys actually use those? Yeah, sometimes, when we're, like, having country food. Ugh. Country food. What? How can you not like country food? Okay. What do you like? - KFC. - Ooh, expensive. I hate how every home has stupid Inuit art, even though it all looks the same. And it's like, how many silly fish pictures can we make? And the only reason people keep making these dumb pictures is so they can sell them to rich Qallunaat who feel sorry for us. And they're all, like, painted by eight-year-olds. My mom made that picture. Oh. I always see your dad in the parking lot, selling meat. My mom says he's a great hunter. Like the greatest, by far. Did he ever teach you any of the stuff? Like hunting or trapping? Do you think he would like... like, ever take me out sometime? Hey! Hey! Excuse me, hello! Excuse me, private. Uki, what the hell? Maika, I need your rifle. I know you don't believe I'm a good shot, but just trust me on this one, there's something really, really bad outside and we may be in real big trouble. Uki, seriously, what the hell? Not Ijiraq, no. But aliens? Oh yes. Aliens for sure. Probably. Yeah. What the shit?! Gah! Get back! Get back! You should throw yourself a little party, because good for you, not Ijiraq, not stupid Inuk stuff... - Uki, shut up! - You shut up! I'm not even joking right now! I've seen shit like no one's ever seen! They killed other animals! Hundreds! Well, maybe not hundreds, but how am I supposed to count? They're like hunter aliens. - Sorry. - It's cool. You said aliens? But pretending not to be aliens, pretending to be animals. - Where? - Out on the land! Aren't you listening? There's two more, and maybe they'll get tired of country food and want a bite of your bald little weeny. Or this one's stupid tucked-in shirt! Leave, Uki. Get out of here. Nobody cares about the weak stories that you tell so that people can pay attention to you. 'Cause you've got no dad, and your mom's always out with some new guy, and your granny is drunk 24/7. And that's not even our fault, not even a tiny bit, so why don't you just leave everybody alone with your baby stories. Maika. Cops! Hey, Uki, come out! Where is it? I think it ran away. Holy crippity-crap! Oh my God, that was too much! - You guys okay? - What was it, Uki?! Oh, is someone talking to me? You said aliens pretending not to be aliens? Yeah, like an Inuk pretending not to be an Inuk. Man, that thing was onto you. Yeah, why just her? It might be kinda pissy because I killed the little one. How'd they know? You murder it right in front of them? It's the blood! Hear it sniffing? They can smell their own blood! Uh, you got blood too. You said there was two, right? Oh my God, where's the other one? How should I know? You should just wash the blood off. It stains! That's what happened to... - Aju! - What? Aju's got blood! I need to borrow your Honda. Forget it. Qanuippit? Run, go! Run! Meet me at Qimmiq's crate! - Maika! - Maika, come on! What is that? It's so scary! What's going on? What is that? Maika... They're waiting. Chill, chill, chill. It's okay, they can't hurt us here. What happened to Willie Isaac? His face is all rubbery! - Who are you calling? - At a at a and An a an a! No, they'll kill me! They never answer when they're out dancing. My parents are way drunk by now. Same. No answer. The cops! The cops! Call Peters! - Got it. - But don't say aliens. Say we're in Qimmiq's crate and there's a whole bunch of drunk men outside trying to get in. Pang police department. Hey, hey, I need to speak to Peters. And what is this in regards to? This is in regards to... This is Jesse Pudluk and a bunch of us kids are trapped in Qimmiq's crate because a bunch of drunk men are outside, saying they're going to chop us up and do other kinds of bad things, so this is a total emergency! Emergency, emergency, emergency! What are we supposed to do now? Hey, remember when we used to always build forts in here? Lee Lee, remember? Forts? Come on, guys. This will be the best. I don't want to build a baby fort. - I want to fight Ijiraq. - It's not Ijiraq. - Go with Jess. - Don't tell me what to do, or I'll tell every I caught you staring at that picture - of that boy... - Get! This is not a little bitch fort. This is an F-yes fort, where we trade secrets and tell stories that can only be told in the fort. Basically this is the best, and you should consider yourself lucky to be invited. What's weird was that one, the one chasing me, just all a sudden stopped, and then started doing that weird walk again. All these stupid alien monsters are in town because I went out there and I killed the baby one. I always ruin everything. No, I'm the one who dared you to go out there. I know dares are unresistable to you. Yeah, you're right. This is all your fault. Too bad you're a butthole and the exact opposite of a friend. Hey, you know what I'm thinking of? - What? - What? Ma ha ha. What? Your Anaanatsiaq never tell you? Nope. Well, he's a creepy little guy with long skinny fingers, and he runs around the North. And you know what he does? Little kids: What? He... tickles people until they die with a tickle smile on their face. Hey, stop it! Aju, what grade are you going into next year? Five. - - So is Ala. - - Yep. We might have the same homeroom next year. Oh my God. Uh, I'll go check. Hey, who are, like, the hot guys in your grade? - Eww! - - Eww! I think Peters is out there. Her cop truck is out there, but I can't see her. Stay in there, don't come out! Stay! What's happening to her? What's going on? Peters was awesome. And we called her out here. And basically we're trapped. I have to take care of this. You? Well, yeah. I'm responsible. Okay, cool. See you. Whatever, Uki. You're just as responsible as anybody else in this. Okay, I'll participate in saving Pang, because, A, I'm not scared, and plus, B, I love Pang. And if you ask around, everyone in Pang loves me. No, guys, this really is my fault. Who cares? Let's just do something. But so everybody knows, none of this is my fault. I would only go because we have to get what got Peters. Okay, so first, what do we know about these... Skins, I've been calling them Skins. Cool. So we know they can, like, smell their own blood, and noodles come out of their hands, and claws come out of the noodles. Which are super sharp, and they suck up blood to use as fuel for their liver ship. Maybe they also need blood for their own power? They might want our blood too. So they're just horny for blood? How'd you kill the little one? Oh, I cut open it's throat with an ulu. Nasty. I love it. They do that weird walk until they get close. That's why they wear skins! To try and get close. Dummies, think they're tricky. And then they run really fast and really strong. But I think they get tired. Like, maybe if they don't have enough blood, they can only be fast and strong for short bits. They must be strong by now, they probably just sucked up all of Peter's blood. Girl, you know a lot. My Dad always told me you have to observe what you're going to hunt to understand how to hunt it. We're gonna hunt them? They came here to hunt us, but what they don't know is that we're the best hunters there is. We're going out for a bit. Aju, stay here, okay? You're going out there? Yeah, come on, we've gotta take care of this. I can't. Lee Lee, you have to be brave. No, I don't. I'm scared. Why? 'Cause this is frickin' scary. Lee Lee, the Skins are trying to get us right in the B's and the V's, and we can't just let them. I'm not like you guys. I wish I was, but I'm not. You guys do so many awesome things. It's okay, Lee Lee. Keep the little ones safe. You gotta do one thing and lock the door behind us, though. You got this. So how are we gonna do this? Uh, first we need something like... Here. Give me your jacket, they'll smell the blood. Okay. First... What? Do you carry that around, like, just in case? Shut up already! Ah, Jesusie, puke in my mouth. - It's a disguise. - Ugh, God. Ugh. Okay. Hold this by the door. Now! Go, go, go, go! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Oh, wait. No. That's my Ataata's. Let's go hunting. Wait. We have to. Come on. Nobody fucks with the girls from Pang. Peters. How sucky if you're like, an alien, and you're so hot for blood, you've gotta go everywhere to vacuum it up. Like, obviously, we're going to make a real mess. There's blood there, and blood here! And oh my, look at all the blood there! That's because Uki was just there murdering your BF. - Shh! - I'm just saying. - - The perfume. - What? If the perfume wasn't for Tiktak, who was it for? - Oh my God. - Dude, really? All you did was flirt with him. I thought friends have each other's back. It's an established fact that I liked him first. He was talking to me! I tried to get you to talk to him, but you were all like, quiet, and like, looking at the ground. Whatever! You were all like, "Blah, blah, I like KFC, "your mother's artwork sucks." I was just talking back, holy. I don't even like him. He's got that lip fur which is just gross. His moustache is cute. Fine! Like, what am I supposed to say? - Say you don't like him! - I just did! That's true, she just did. - All right? - Fine. Fine. Can we go back to hunting a blood-sucking alien? It's just a dog. But the blood. - Help me! - Jesse! Get him off! Go! Gross! Oh my God, are you okay? Yeah, it was more just freaky. That's two for Uki, which makes the meanest alien killer in the North, by far. I guess we can't choose who we are. Stay alert. The other one could come at any second, and it's got no injuries. This trap we're going to set is really chancy because it requires bait, which I'm going to be. So that makes both you chicks responsible for me not dying. As if! Don't act so goody-goody, saying you're bait. What if I want to be bait? You guys sound like you want to be on "To Catch A Predator." It's dangerous, okay? They're always using bait on those old pervos. - That show's the best. - So what? - No one's daring you. - No doy. I'm volunteering. That's because I'm an especially cool person, which, sorry, like being a mean alien killer, is a thing you have to be born as. Uki, I'm sorry. I know I've been a crap friend. True, I'm still bait. Fine. I'm not stopping you. I'm just saying. I am sorry. But you're fully annoying. You know that, right? Well, well, look at this little bitch. - Hey. - Hey. Was that your Honda making that bang? Yeah, thing's brand new and it already has a backfire. Boo-hoo! I just wanted... I just got a little freaked out before. - I'm sorry. - Well, if you're so sorry... Uki! If you're so sorry, let us use your Honda. Yeah, whatever you need. All right, trap just got better. Uh, Jesse, you're gonna go with Thomassie. And Uki, I've got something planned for you. Anything? No. - So... - Do you think Maika likes me? Yeah. Yeah, I think she does. Ugh, what's taking so long? Do you think this one chickened out because we murdered the other two so hard? Patience, Uki. Hunting is patience. I'm gonna take this thing out. Eww... You know, Lefebvre was a douche, but he didn't deserve to get his skin torn off and sewn by an alien. Maybe just a butt probe. I'm gonna look under the skin. Should I? I can't help it! I'm gonna look. I'm gonna look. Eww... Oh my God, you guys won't believe what's under here. It's so rude, and like, slimy! It's got an ugly mouth. Like, a really ugly mouth. This totally reeks, like... You remember that raven, Maika? The one that had diarrhea and kept on doing it on your front steps every day? It's like that. Raven diarrhea. Uki, shut up! Turn around! Turn around! It's coming. Hey, come get me. Go, go, go! You must be pretty pissy about this. And remember, I killed the other too, so you should be double pissy. Are you gonna get me? You want some tasty human flesh? Now! Aw, crap. Oh my God. Uki, come on! Maika! Uki! It's behind you, come on! Oh my God! Oh my God! Uki, come on! Uki! I'm stuck! Uki, come on! Don't let go! Uki, come on! - It's got me! - Oh my God! Here, let me help! Okay, don't let go. Don't let go! Hold tight, okay? Hold tight! Uki, don't let go! Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?! Put pressure on it! I got it. I just need you to get up, please, Uki? Is she breathing? - I don't know! - What do you mean? I... - I can't hear anything. - What do you mean? - Uki, you asshole! - Come on! Wake up! Uki! Oh my God. Oh my god. Are you okay? I think I saw Jesusie. He looked like that old drunk who always pulls it out in front of girls. What? It's okay. You're gonna be okay. Don't let it get away. I'm not leaving you. If you don't go kill it, I'm gonna hate you for life. Uki. 'Cause then I got all my blood sucked for nothing. And then Pang is going to have to wait for me to recover to save it. I'll see you soon. Maika! I'm coming with. Friends got each other's back. He likes you. Not true. True. And you like him. - So not true. - True. You should. I'd be a garbage friend if I said not to. Look. What the... What'd they do to your house? It's in there. At a at a? At a at a! At a at a! Fight it, you have to! Maika, are you okay? I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Jess, I'm stuck! Okay, I'm coming. At a at a, fight it! It will get weaker! You have to! I fought like you taught me. Its throat, At a at a! You have to cut its throat! Told you. No one fucks with the girls from Pang. How come you never talked to me at school before? I always thought you were too crazy. Why didn't you ever talk to me? I always thought you were too cool. Will you talk to me when starts this year? This is the best time I had all summer. Me too. I'll check. - Oh my God! - - What?! At a at a! Is everyone okay? Uki! Are you okay? Aliens were hot for my blood, but Maika didn't let them take it all. What is that? I think it's the meat ship. My bike is still out there. - We did it! - We scared 'em off! No. I want to keep going. Quit it with the flyers. We're not exactly dying for customers. We're a hit because of you. No, we're a hit because we sell totally mamaqtuq country food. Seriously? I thought they had enough of this forever ago. Excuse me, folks. Excuse me. Are you the young lady that fought the aliens. I'm just a hunter. Hey, hey! News chick! I killed tons of aliens. I found the aliens, and I knew they were aliens before anyone else knew they were aliens. I got clawed by one after it chased me under a house. So I'm pretty much the hero of this town. Point your cameras over here. Come on, let's get this. I'll tell you everything, which will make you pee your pants, and you'll love it. So this one's for sure gonna make you lots of money, so that's why you're gonna have to pay me in advance if you want all access, or I'll accept either of you guy's phones. What kinda phones you got?
