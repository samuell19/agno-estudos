- [Narrator] Somewhere in the dark depths of the universe far below the world known as Earth, is the ultimate destination, all things evil. Hell. Here, all beings who have committed atrocities in life are tormented for eternity, ruled over by the fallen angel Lucifer. A great war erupted when the dark lord Desecrator challenged Lucifer for his crown. The possession of the key to Hell itself. But Lord Desecrator's own general, Dominator, stole the key for himself. Desecrator sent an army of demons to pursue Dominator and return the key, but to no avail. (growling and screaming) (loud rumbling) (intense electric guitar music) In desperation, Lord Desecrator sent three other warriors to destroy Dominator. Decimator, Extricator, and Lady Violator. But the real war is just beginning. ("Carrion" by Cradle of Filth) * Lurking in the shade * Of dark and fragrant trees * Shaking from the rage * That tore the heavens free * A vagrant Angel * His with span to see * The garden swell with terrors * To banish man and Eve * Another fall from grace * Whiplashed from the gates * Half-naked and insane * Full-blooded, breasted * Nerve ends tested * To behests of pain * A sombre lot to gain * A storm slid in * Borne by carnal winds * The upper ether thinned * And therein sat abominations (bells ringing) (electricity zapping) - Demonica's fugid, succubine on entere. Demonica's fugid, succubine on entere. Demonica's fugid, succubine on entere. Oh well a few more Sidney, then we call it a night. (groaning) Yeah I know it's a hassle Sidney, but someone's got to do it or the world will be crawling with the walking dead. (lightening crashing) (growling) Still no point bitching about it, eh? (screaming) It pays the bills right? Oh shit. (glass breaking) (loud rumbling and crashing) Oh, if only people knew what we get up to on their behalf. And how do we explain this to the bereaved family? (bells tinkling) (heavy metal music) - Tara, Fina, Dad and Sidney are nearly done. Maybe we should forget all about this. - You worry too much little sister. No sweat, I've got it. Now let's rock. (heavy guitar music) - Now what? (heavy metal music) - Tara, Molly, Fina, you idiots, stop! You don't know what you're messing with. Stop now. Oh no. (electricity blasting) - [Dominator] Up yours scumbag. (electricity zapping) What the fuck? (screaming) (grunting) (giggling) What's going on here then? Start talking shit head. - Um, he uh, he can't speak. He's mute you see. - [Dominator] I don't give a damn, I'll kill him anyway. - It's humping my leg. Get it off, get it off. - First time you've ever turned down free sex. (laughing) (growling) - [Dominator] I knew this was a wind up. (loud rumbling) (electricity zapping) - Ow, stop it, please. (glass shattering) - [Dominator] Play fragetar. (screaming) Strike. Now is one of you dweebs gonna give me an explanation? Or do you wanna hear the chorus? - Oh aren't you cute. What's your name? (growling) - Just keep him off my legs. (laughing) (birds chirping) - Oh what a dream. This tall dark demon shows up and oh was he tasty. - Let me guess, he made cool music, smacked some other demons around, and smashed Dad's favorite stained glass window? Sorry Fina, that was for real. (giggling) - Look at Molly. Hey I wonder what he likes for breakfast? - Deviled eggs? - Nah, 10 shredded wheat. - I think I know what happened Mister, um, uh Dominator. My daughters borrowed one of my archold volumes. Somehow playing the lost chord opened up a gateway from Hell. - [Dominator] Darkadia, the sonic region of Hell. - Uh yes, yes, quite. And um, well, and you popped through. - [Dominator] Then pop me right bloody back again then. - Well uh, well I'm, I'm sure there's a reversal spell in here somewhere. Oh yes, this might be it. - [Dominator] Well? (clearing throat) - Well it seems there isn't a reversal spell for playing the lost chord in this volume. Perhaps it'll be in one of the others. - [Dominator] It had fucking better be. - Look it isn't my fault we can't send you back immediately. And we can't shut that bloody gateway either. God alone knows what else might come through. - [Dominator] Not God, but maybe Ozzy. Or maybe even Elvis, if we're really lucky. (metal tinkling) - So, uh, do we have a deal? I guarantee to find a way to send you back home, and in the meantime you can stay with us and deal with anything else that comes through that gateway, hmm? What's that? - [Dominator] Uh nothing that concerns you. Just concentrate on getting me home. Unless of course you want to throw your daughters into the bargain. - My daughters? What do you take me for? - [Dominator] Ah, don't worry. I'll pay for them. (electricity zapping) - [Lady Violator] Always the ladies man. Hey my love. - [Dominator] Lady Violator. And I take it from the gorillas that you're not here for a shag? - Before you hand over your women, get him to tell you how he betrayed me. - Desecrator never said nothing about no lovey dovey crap. Right bro? - Fraggin' A Decimator, tank that wanker Dominator, that swally sad. - Quiet! I'll deal with this. Dominator (speaking in foreign language) Sonic Pits. Lord Desecrator demands the return of that which is his. The key to Hell. You will hand it over to me and return with us for punishment. (electricity zapping) - [Dominator] Clumsy. - Don't dis the bro. - They're killing him. Can't you stop them? - [Lady Violator] Of course. But I can't think of a good reason right now. (electricity zapping) - Bastard. - After him you idiots. (growling) (motor cycle engine rumbling) - [Dominator] Tell Lord Desecrator to sit on this. If you ever get back. - Huh, you got lousy taste in lovers Vi. The creep's a coward. - [Lady Violator] No, he's clever. Dominator knows he can't take on the three of us at once. - Then lets go get him. (laughing) - Dad what's going on? - Where's Dominator? - Well might you ask Fina. It's all going rather horribly wrong. - It was awful wasn't it? With the Lost Chord. I'm sorry. - Oh that's alright Tara. I've a feeling the whole world's going to be sorry. The Prime Minster's going to be livid. I was supposed to keep all this under wraps. - Good grief girl. Can't you even hold a mirror straight? - I'm trainee reporter Miss Lynn, not a makeup girl. - You are a dogs body Lendra, just do as your told. Good afternoon London, this is Judith Lynn for XLN. I'm on the the Thames embankment speaking to some of the less fortunate who live in our capitol. Uh, uh. (gasping) - This is Lendra Patel reporting from the heart of London where we are witnessing an aerial battle between what I can only describe as monsters. - What's the time Mr. Wolf? - Who fragging cares. (loud explosion) - Big Ben's gone. I don't believe it. - Surrender and Desecrator might go easy on you. There's no reason why you and I shouldn't get back together again. - [Dominator] You're pissing in the wind Violator. It's over between us. Now get lost. - [Lendra] One of the creatures has crash landed. I can see that it's a woman, and boy is she pissed off. - Two timing bastard. (heavy metal music) (scream singing) * All for fire * Keep it on fire * Burn this noise * Keep it on fire (loud rumbling) * Buckle and break * Drop it like you say (yelling battle cry) (sirens blaring) - [Lendra] I can hear sirens. I think the police are on their way. - Oh my God. What the hell is happening here Bishop? (heavy metal music) (loud rumbling) * All for fire * Keep it on fire - We'll take him back to Lord Desecrator, alive. - Screw that. Desecrator only wants the key. Dominator is ours, right bro? - Dead fucking A he is. And the bastards spraying some up. (metal tinkling) (electricity pulsing) - What the fuck? - He's using the key. Look out. (screaming) - [Dominator] Cool. - Excuse me, sir. Could you tell me who you are and what's going on here? - [Dominator] Sure, right after you take your clothes off babe. - Oh. - [Police] You, halt. Park or we fire. You had your chance. Open fire. (metal clinging) (engine rumbling) Oh bugger. - Geez. - Get me Dr. Payne. Now dammit. - What the frag happened there man? - Dominator used the key to teleport us away. Devious wanker. - Where's Lady Violator? - Who gives a fuck. - I don't. - More to the point, what are we gonna do? - I dunno. - Even if we do get back to Hell, Desecrator will kick our asses for failing. - Bastard. Woah what's all this lot Mate? There's a rook of ale here. Smells good. (gulping and burping) Smooth. (gulping and burping) - Hey um, a couple more before we um, hit the road? - Alright then piss head. To Dominator, may he rot in eternities back passage. (liquid gurgling and burping) (instruments tuning) - Right, fuck 'em all, let's go. (heavy metal music) - What? What uh? You have to speak up I can't, I can't hear you. No I said I can't. Hang on a minute. Would you please shut up! - [Tara] Nice end to the song Dad. (electricity sparking) - What about those others? - [Dominator] They went somewhere else. Forget 'em. Let's say we make our own music. (laughing) - Uh that's quite enough of that thank you. Um, Dominator, um, could you come with me for a moment? There's some important people who would like to meet you. These past few years an increasing number of supernatural entities have found their way to Earth. We've even had to start hexing corpses so they can't be taken over by the undead. Don't suppose you know anything about it? - [Dominator] Something seems familiar, I've got to admit. Dunno know what though. - Uh no, I don't know either. I just feel as if we're over looking the blindingly obvious in all this. What, what? What the hell are you doing? - [Dominator] What I promised I'd do. Watch. (cackling and growling) Oy. (speaking foreign language) (metal clinging) - Fool Base metal cannot harm me. - Oh yeah? What about electricity then? (screaming) Hey don't touch that dial. Bloody Goth's. - Prime Minister, gentlemen, this is Dominator. He claims to be from the sonic pits of hell. And I regret to say I've been unable to send him back, and now a gateway has been opened. I have to warn you that we can expect more and possibly worse visitors. - Sonic pits? Hell? - Gentlemen, please, let's stay calm. I'm sure Dr. Payne wouldn't have brought, um, Dominator here if he posed as any threat. - Indeed. Dominator has agreed to deal with any further intruders. In return, I'm looking for a way to send him back. - [Dominator] Screw all that. Just find a way to get me back home. 'Cause if Lord Desecrator himself comes from Hell after me, your little planet's in a whole fucking heap of shit. See ya. - Now uh Dominator, wait. - If this Dominator continues to act as a free agent, there'll be panic in the streets. And if he isn't with us, he's against us. I believe I know someone who can help. For a price. (wind whistling) - Guess who. Hey, you okay? - [Dominator] Bored. Hey, wanna shag? - Uh frankly yes. But there are certain rituals a girl likes, you know. Talking, getting to know someone. So what's home like? Motorhead album covers immediately spring to mind. - [Dominator] It's more like Cradle of Filth actually. - Can't blame you for wanting to get back there. - [Dominator] Hey I like it. - You never said why those others came after you. - [Dominator] Lady Violator and her stooges? Ah, they were after this. Most valuable thing in all damnation. The key to Hell itself. - It's, it's. - [Dominator] Powerful is what it is. Shred your soul in seconds if you don't know what you're doing. And believe you me, Lord Desecrator won't give it up in a hurry. It means too much to him. - So, who's Desecrator? And why steal it from him in the first place? - There's a war going on in Hell. A war for power. The key, you see, gives its owner almost limitless powers. Lord Desecrator stole the key first from Lucifer 'cause he fancies himself as a new top dog in Hell. So I stole the key from him as I don't like the idea of serving that wanker for the next few thousand years. So that's why he sent those others to Earth after me. - But why not use the key yourself to get home? - [Dominator] Nah. I tried that already, didn't work. No idea why. Sometimes it works for me, sometimes not at all. Guess I'm not evil enough or something. You're different from your sisters. - Same father, three different mothers. Cost Dad a fortune in maintenance. Molly's mother was a teacher, Fina's was a witch, and mine was a model. - [Dominator] What's this? Some kind of mating ritual? - Something like that. - Guys the cut is smoking, I mean it. - Oh get lost Fina, I'll hear it later. - Oh come on. Molly's uploading it right now. I've got a good feeling about this. Dom, you're gonna be a star. - I'll upload a pic of you Dom. Uh, strike a pose yeah. Piss off Sidney. (grunting) You're only jealous. (grunting) - I'm here at Charing Cross asking Londoners, do you believe in the supernatural? (squealing) (electricity sparking) (heavy metal music) * Stand and fight * Stand and fight * Stand and fight * Stand and fight (engine rumbling) * You're the one here to claim my soul (electricity zapping) (screaming) (evil laughing) (loud explosion) (train wheels squeaking) (gasping) - [Dominator] Makes you horny huh? What are you doing after the show then babe? - Oh. (ominous music) (lasers shooting) (laughing) ("Perfect" by Skith) * When I go to sleep * I lay my head * Then all I can see is you in front of me * Why did you * Creep into my head * One day * And you never went away * Why did you do this * I am scarred in the nicest way but I want it to heal * Feel so pathetic that I can't control my emotions * Why I am so hyper every day * Because of you? * And I wonder where, what you are * As I fall down * Take my soul away from you * And I wonder now * If you weren't so perfect * What you are as I fall (loud explosions) (upbeat music) (loud crashing and glass breaking) - Just so they know what to put on your gravestone, it's fragged by the Hellkatt. - [Dominator] Never heard of you darling. - Ditto, but I've been hired to kill you, and. - [Dominator] Hey wait a minute, who are you? - I'm half human, half demon on my father's side. Some big shot called Desecrator. And when I find him, he's meat. - [Dominator] It sounds like we have a whole lot in common. We should uh, get together. You know, swap um, amongst other things, details. - [Hellkatt] Well swap something anyway. (groaning) - [Dominator] Who hired you? - Some politician. Guy called Bishop. Dunno why though. - [Dominator] Who cares. (phone ringing) - What the hell? - [Dominator] The Doc gave it to me for emergencies. Hey, this better be good. What? - It's me Dom, Tara. The band sites are live man. Over nine million hits. We just called a press conference at the Savoy. Can you get there? - [Dominator] Uh give me a break. I'm uh, I'm busy, uh, saving the world. - Look pal, I wanna be famous even if you don't. Please, can you get to the Savoy? - [Dominator] I'll definitely be coming soon Tara. (groaning) (laughing) - [Extricator] Hey don't go light now. - Listen, I've got one for you. Now hey, do you remember when the Kanakium dead rebelled? Man we slaughtered those decomposing bastards. - We dazed the embattled souls for weeks didn't we? - We did. - Holy shit, hallucinations. Lord Desecrator. - What the fuck are you two doing? - Um yeah, um sorry boss. Dominator used that key he stole off you against us and he stumped our asses bad. - Yeah and um, we're just stocking up for the rematch, yeah. - And Lady Violator? - Um, buggered off somewhere. I dunno. - Kill Dominator. - Sure, yeah, no problem, yeah we will. But later. - Now! - Listen Desecrator, you're a big shot in Hell, okay. But here you're just a fucking midget. Copy. - You will have all eternity to regret that. I'll be back. - You know maybe that wasn't so clever man. - Oh who gives a frag. A toast! Fuck all fuckers. - Good fucking toast. A fucking men, man. Bottoms up. - [Lendra] What are they? Where did they come from? Why the hell are they wrecking London? - Dammit man, you told me we were dealing with a few ghosts. - Relax sir, and try to get a good nights sleep. Things always look better in the morning. I wish. - What if your wish was answered Mr. Bishop? Indeed, what if I were to offer you the position of King of the world? - All girl rock group Crowcut has set the music world ablaze. Every celeb in town is out tonight for their launch party. I can see Miss Gurley, Howard Volderman, and oh Dominator. (applauding) - [Dominator] Hey, looking good kid. (heavy techno music) - Look I really like him. And I know he feels the same way. - Yeah right. - He's stringing you along like a thunderbirds puppet. - Not. He took me into his confidence. He showed me the key he stole from Desecrator. That's why those others came after him. (car horn honking) - Where have you been? People are getting impatient. - Hey don't hustle the main man Tara. - Come on, it's play time. (audience cheering and applauding) - Hi everyone. We're Crowcut. Sorry we're late. This one's called Die Goth's Die. (heavy metal music) - [Lady Violator] Relax. Don't to fight me. Traitor! Pick this you bastard. (electricity surging) (screaming) - Scum! - [Dominator] Violator's taken control of your mind. You have to fight back Tara. Fight back Tara! Fight damn you! - I, I. It's alright, I've got my head back. Oops, I think I've got her body as well. Cool And her powers. Hey I can fly. - [Dominator] Are you alright? - I am now. - Lucky cow. - Why her? Not even as if she's the pretty one. - Mind and get beer now Dave. None of your cheap wine. What's the big idea? Put the fucking lights out. - [Police] On your feet. - [Homeless Man] Says fucking who, James. - [Police] Says fucking me, asshole. - Where are we going man? - [Police] Somewhere warm. Don't you worry. - The beer was too expensive. So I got some. Oh shit. - You caused havoc back there. This can't go on. - [Dominator] Then send me back home. - You think I haven't tried. None of the usual spells work. Like something on the other side was counteracting them. - [Dominator] Desecrator. What's he up to? (electricity zapping) - Well? - [Dominator] No ecto residue. Whatever took those people, it wasn't from my town. - 200 homeless have vanished in London over the last week. Isn't there anyway you can tell what happened here? - [Dominator] Hey, I can try. Lemme see. (electricity sparking) - Military. It has to be. And that means the government. (liquid pouring) - [Fina] Looks like you could use this. Good for the soul, they say. To you sweetie. Oh much better. - [Dominator] Ah, to me. Oh you're beautiful. ("Heroin" by Jezebel) * Can't feel my skin * Can't open my mouth * Can't do anything * No mind, no limbs * My eyes have peeled * Just let me lie here * Free from fear * Quiet on the floor * For the first time the great tales have something to adore * Hell I feel so nice (electricity zapping) - [Fina] This is what you wanted? - [Dominator] Fina stop! - You shouldn't interfere in my plans Dominator. It hurts me. And soon I will hurt you. - [Dominator] Not clever. That key gives Lord Desecrator a whole lot of power he doesn't need. - Oh shit, I'm sorry, I didn't mean. - You bastards. - [Extricator] God, you dropped one in a Hackney carriage? - [Decimator] No. (farting) I am now. Oh come on you daft bastard, we're here. Shift your fat ass. - I haven't got an ass, fat or otherwise, have I? - Well just, well shift your skull and tentacles then. Come on, get out. Come on you fat bastard. - [Dominator] Don't you two ever learn? - No, not us man. - [Dominator] What do you want? - Eh we've left Desecrator's employment. We've gotten the sack, drinking on the job. - Okay short version. We get home, Desecrator wipes us out. If he found his way, then dit fucking oh. - Right. - Now, seeing as he's after you too, we figured we'd stand a better chance together. What do you say pal? Let's all be heroes and save the Earth. - [Dominator] This hero thing seems to be catching. - Hey, we're starting to like this mud ball. It's fun. We don't want Desecrator up here spoiling it. - You said it me man. (somber music) - Right, get her now. - [Police] Open fire. (electricity zapping) - Hi. We've got quite a night ahead of us. We're going to discover all your secrets. And an old friend of yours might be dropping by as well. Cool, huh? - You mean Lord Desecrator? You idiot. You can't. - Oh I can, I will. And you're going to help me. - But she can't have just disappeared. - [Dominator] Tara has Lady Violator's body and powers now. She can take care of herself. - She's my daughter for Christ sake. - It's my fault she went. Maybe I can find her. - Fina, what are you doing? - Mom was a witch remember? She taught me a few things. There, St. Paul's Cathedral. - [Dominator] Oy you two, let's go save the bitter skirt. Oh yeah, if it's Desecrator, we'll be needing help. Call this number.

About so-so. Huh, be like that then. - Oh bugger, ambush. - [Dominator] Chill Decimator. She's with me. - Fuh, strike a line, look at that. Eh, you would, wouldn't ya? - Well I would if I had any discernible genitals, yeah. - [Decimator] Well what's that then? I thought that was your nob. - That's me gun. (screaming) - The chains will keep her quiet while the machine draws off her energy and uses it to feed to feed this process you've set up. Whatever it is. - Official secret. Need to know only. Thank you. (mumbling) Everything's ready. You got what you wanted? - I possess the key once more. My powers are at optimum strength. Start the transfer. - The raw material for your Earth body is ready. But how do I know you'll keep your word? - Believe me, your stature shall be as no mortal has ever known before. (screaming) (growling) - [Police] Here it comes, get ready. Open fire. - Honestly what kind of a welcome is that? - I think we're in the right place. (sirens blaring) (screaming) - [Man] We've got intruders sir. - Stop them, by any means necessary. This won't take much longer. - [Dominator] Having fun Mr. Bishop? - Fraggin' A. - [Dominator] Gotcha babe. - Oh thank you, you two timing bastard. It's your fault I'm here. If you hadn't shagged that sex starved sister of mine. - [Dominator] Ah yeah, sorry about that. - Looks like we got here just in time. - Oh do you think so? Huh, look. (lasers shooting) - I'll be, frag me with a sharp stick, look at that. - Now, the sacrifice of flesh. (heavy breathing) - Oh shit. - And um, what now smart ass? - I haven't got an ass, either smart or otherwise. You get stalking, you're the big angry looking one. - Bugger that. - Well you're all mouth and CGI trousers you. - That's my father? - [Dominator] Yeah, that's him alright. - Pucker up Daddy, it's fragging time. - You're no daughter of mine. Burn bastard, burn. - [Dominator] Leave her alone bastard. It's me you want. (laughing) - Nice one nob head. You trying to get us all wiped? - [Dominator] Everybody outside, now. - You're a beast of your word Desecrator. We can do business together. - Insect. You do what I tell you. There is much I need to know about this world, and you will tell me. I will suck your soul's knowledge dry like marrow from a bone. - But, but you said, wait a minute, I built a new body for you. - I lied. This world shall finally be mine. All that I planned has come to pass. You and Dominator and the others unwittingly paved the way for me by weakening the fabric between Hell and Earth. Now it is time for me to assume my rightful place as ruler of all realities. - Oh shit. (screaming) (heavy metal music) - St. Paul's Cathedral where something very weird is going on. The building itself appears to be collapsing. (glass shattering) Oh my god, what the hell is that? - Here comes trouble. - Hello London. - Maybe not. - Well go to the foot of our stairs. - What is that? - Desecrator. Oh bollocks, we're too late. - Ow. I'll never be mean to a fucker again. We safe yet? - [Dominator] Uh no. - Can we stop him? - [Dominator] Maybe. But I say we hit the bastard with everything we've got. (loud rumbling) (intense heavy metal) (loud explosions and glass shattering) - King of the world, king of Hell, king of every fragging where. - Oh my god, he's eaten the world. - [Dominator] Yeah that's one way of looking at it. - We need a plan dammit. - [Dominator] Yeah, such as? - It's all your fault Tara. You talked us into playing the last chord in the first place. - Right bloody mess we're in now. - [Dominator] Come off it. You gave Desecrator his key back. Without it, he wouldn't have been able to cross over to Earth. - Hey. - Hellkatt said Desecrator raped her mother, but then he returned to Hell. How did that get arranged? - A sacrifice I think. - We need to find a sacrifice bigger than all those poor people that helped bring him through in the first place. Hey what if we get Desecrator to sacrifice himself? - Sounds good. So what do we use as the sacrificial knife. - Look, what if we hit the key with something so powerful that it unlocks Desecrator from his new body and drags his spirit back to hell? Something like. - [Dominator] The Lost Chord played backwards. - You do that, while I perform an exorcism and I think we may get a serious result. - It's as good a plan as any. Shall we? - [Dominator] Yeah, let's go frag the bastard. (intense heavy metal music) Just make sure you time it right Doc. - Just you get on with it. (growling singing) (electricity zapping) - [Dominator] Oy, you lot, follow me. Quick through there, we've got to find his brain. * Here we go, here we go, here we go * Here we go, here we go, here we go - Down there, I can feel him. Eat shit Daddy. - Oops. - You presume to challenge the king of everything? Then die! - Oh bugger, the power's gone down. - Anybody got 10 pound for the meter. Oy, Dom, we're in big trouble here. - [Dominator] The rest of you fall back. Leave the rest to me. - Like hell. I'm coming with you. - [Dominator] Bullocks you are. Hellkatt, get her out of here. - No. (intense metal music) - Come to me little insect. - [Dominator] Alright Doc, now! - Exo demonicas, exo malificarum, exo monsterous. - What? No, not me you cannot sacrifice me. (screaming singing) (loud explosion) - [Molly] What happened? Where's Dominator? - Still up there. - I think it's over. - Cool. Hi Sis. - You okay? - I don't know. Ask me later. (engine rumbling) You did it. You got him. - [Dominator] Huh, it was nothing. - Ugh. - Thank God that's over. - I wouldn't be surprised if he gave us a hand somewhere along the line. Hey where are you two off to? - We're gonna find a bar and celebrate. - Yeah alcohol's cool. I need a new hobby now that I'm stuck here. - Fair enough. Have one for me. - [Dominator] Hey, they've got the right idea. Shall we? - Does Keith Richards play guitar? - [Dominator] Only when I let him. Come on. (engine rumbling) - Aw, I was hoping for a a threesome. - Um, I have to explain things to the Prime Minister. Another time perhaps. - That's alright. But uh, see if he fancies joining in. (laughing) - Oh that was a day and a half wasn't it archaic? - Unbelievable archy. - [Extricator] I'll tell you what, looking back on it. - [Decimator] Yeah. - [Extricator] I thought we were a bit dirty to start with. - [Decimator] We were a bit yeah. - [Extricator] And for no good reason. And then we got good and we got nice. - [Decimator] Yeah. - [Extricator] And we saved the world. - [Decimator] Yeah. - [Extricator] And we developed a taste for ale all in the same day. - [Decimator] I tell you what, being a good guy, and liking beer, right, is really something. - [Extricator] Right okay.
