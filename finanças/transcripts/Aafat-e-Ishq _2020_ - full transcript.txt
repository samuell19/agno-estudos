I... I am the red fairy. Cursed Doom is my Destiny for I am the all-consuming fire to the moths that I attract. Scared you?... Let it be... Let's tell you a not so simple story of an old house in a little city... ...where lived an innocent, naive, and beautiful girl. Her name was Lallo. She had no one to cuddle up to. An orphan since birth. But as the saying goes... When you've no one to turn to, there's always the ghost. "Lover singing a song..." "Is it love or is it a crime?" "She has never seen joy..." "...because she ignores her heart." "The one blessed with this nature..." "...and a luck that's rotten." "You always hit a new low..." "...when you're possessed..." "...when you're possessed..." "...when you're possessed by the ghost of love." "...when you're possessed by the ghost of love." Atmaram Kishore. The world-famous singer of our town One hit wonder. But also one-hit surrender. Poor thing...his soul stuck to his phone when he died. Lallo's parents bid her farewell when she was young. Do you know where Lallo and Atmaram met? At the crematorium. Whenever the song plays, his spirit appears. One more thing... Except for Lallo, no one else can see Atmaram. Lallo has two more friends in the neighbourhood. Suhani from the parlour. And the son of the parlour owner Pratap. Lallo madam, mission accomplished. Here's your identity card. Thank you, Pratap. Please use your right hand. Lallo is technologically challenged ...And Pratap always comes to rescue her. But they both hesitate - to take their acquaintance further. - Pratap, at least have a cup of tea. Another time maybe. The future is waiting for me. And this is me. The angle's not right and I am looking weird Paralysis and asthma. Nothing can keep me away from fashion. There's no way I won't get my eyebrow done. I just call Suhani from the parlour downstairs. Take a look, aunty. I've to go downstairs and open the parlour. Otherwise, aunty will start screaming at me... O image in the mirror.... do you see Even the mirror is looking at you in awe. Bravo. If my husband was here, he would say... ...the ruins indicate that the building was once robust. 'His eyes closed as he took a bite into the warm, melting mozzarella' 'And when he opened them...' '...his love was there in front of him smiling.' 'Her face resting in her hands and watching him in intent adoration.' Lallo's a sight to watch today. Because she believes her fate is about to change, Just like in her favourite book, 'The Ship of my Dreams'. You know, Atma, how many boyfriends Suhani has? And I can't even say hi to anyone. Did you feel bad? Sorry. - I look much more beautiful. - Aunt, you look stunning even today. Tea is here. I need my bed tea to wake up Aunty... Put the money on my tab. She keeps asking about the money. If we start keeping tabs on aunty's account, then we're doomed. Lallo...?? What can I comment on Lallo's fate? She's got her hands full dealing with a ghost, a spirit... ...and sick old me. I've told her several times that she doesn't have to be alone. At least find a handsome prince for yourself. Thank God Lallo loves her books and stories Her imagination helps distract her from real life Two hours? Is there a carnival in town that you need two hours? I want to know. There you go grinning again I think you've been possessed by some ghost or spirit. If I ever find him... ...I'll first twist his nose. Then pick him up from his ears using pincers. And throw him in a vessel of hot oil... boiling oil. And fry him like a kebab. Aunty...I...It's my birthday today. You know I can't stay two minutes without you. Why do you need two hours? Because, aunty...I turned 30 today, so I... No means no. There I've said it. Turning 30 isn't an achievement like Olympic Gold (Grumbles)Turned 30,she says... There you go with your tears again. Okay, fine. Come here. Laliya, I am telling you something. Come here, Lalli my pony. See what I have for you You didn't think I really forgot your birthday, did you? All this makeup isn't for nothing. I had already told Suhani about the cake yesterday. Look... do you like my kebab cake? It's lovely. God bless you. God bless you. I know what you’re doing You're using me as an excuse to eat food that's not allowed. I don't eat fried things every day. Come here. Look what I got you. This is from your collection of perfumes. There was no need for this... You need it Young buds must spread their fragrance. Dilip sir gave this to me very fondly. I pray this perfume brings sprays love and joy to your life. May you spread your fragrance in all seasons. God bless you and your future family. Do you want me to go on and on? Now, will you cut the cake and feed me... - ...or just keep watching? - Yes... Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Laliya. Happy birthday to you. Dilip was the one who brought Lallo home. He was always helping others. He was a good man, bless him. But I could never make sense of his hobby... ...which was collecting dead butterflies and caterpillars. God knows what he did, and why? Well, I guess it was just a hobby. Aatma, you must be 27-years-old? And look at me. I went from 20 to 30 with you And you're still 27-years-old. What luck. No fear of old age, forever young How am I looking? Lallo would look for books in her reality... ...and reality in her books. And she was obsessed with this one book The book said 30 is her year to find love And she was ready at 30. The place in the book was McNow so she set out for McNow. "Welcome to McNow..." One lemon soda free, with one veg hamburger. Have a good day. Hello, madam. Welcome to McNow How can I be of service to you? One mozzarella cheese crosant. Sorry ma'am, but that's croissant. Yes, that. How am I looking? You would've said the fire died long ago, dear. It's me who is still keeping the sparks alive. Remember that song... "O, my lover..." "I will never be..." These two idiot sisters always come in the frame. Why don't you come a little closer? Fine, I'll move a little. "But in your court, I..." Lallo! - 'Everything happened just' - Excuse me, but can I park my backside on this seat. Thank you. Don't you live in area pin code 226003? Yes... By the way, myself Birender Mishra. Currently posted in GPO. I am starving. Wow... 'Everything happened just like I imagined it...' Watching him eat his burger satisfied my hunger' ''and my cheese croissant lay there getting cold.' 'Has fate brought him to me?' 'Or is it just a coincidence?' 'The answer to this question can solve all the mysteries of..' - Hello, Mr. Mishra... - Kusum. Kusum, you bring the sunshine inside Actually I was looking for you inside. Where inside? In your heart. 'Lallo didn't find her prince charming on her 30th birthday' But she didn't find alive either' Oh, God. These two Kismet, Rehmet are back wearing their favourite purple dress. Did you take the phone? Bloody scavengers, will you loot everything? Supposedly this place has a caretaker, but look how dirty it is. Very dirty. Aunty... Prem Gunjan, the apple of my eye. - Death is hovering over your head. - What? He's Dilip's nephew. My only well-wisher after Lallo. Only one sympathiser. And these two are my useless sisters. Stay away. You jinx. First, you got your parents killed and now our darling sister Ismat. The tea's amazing, Chiku. - What's your name? - Hasn't changed for ten years. Lallo. - Lallo... - She's the one who runs the parlour. She's a bit weird, but... Have you seen Suhani? She already left. Let's keep the parlour closed today. ...but has a good heart. Lallo, where is our sister's passbook. Is it still here, or did you destroy the bank account too? Pack your bags and leave now. That's no way to talk to her. She's been working here all her life for free. So you won't listen to me... Where are you, Aatma? Mic check! 1, 2, 3 Here he is! Singing for the dead as usual. He never misses a chance to perform for his fans. Such an imp! "You're my sweetheart." "You're my desire." "I am the cloud," "and you're my sky." "My body sways, and my heart is overwhelmed." "With your love." "My heart's restless," "waiting for you." "you, you, you." "You're my sweetheart." "You're my desire." Welcome, welcome, to our home. The lawyer's here. It's a good habit. I just have one wish. That you settle down' 'and to see that my son Pratap does too. There she goes again. Always trying to set Pratap up with someone for marriage. This is my daughter-in-law's old handmade recipe book. So beautiful. It will work like magic on Pratap. He'll fall for you in an instant. - But... - I am telling you. Now it's up to you. Aunty had no one except for you who looked after her But here they all are, to claim their pound of flesh Where will you go? I don't know. You can stay with me for a couple of days. Okay. Until you don't... ...find a handsome... ...romantic... I mean, until you don't find another gorgeous place. Often I passed through these steps... ...but never came face to face with you. Even these steps have such an attitude. They never let me know that you climb up and down on them. Amazing... I am... I mean my name is Prem Gunjan. And I am Suhani. "This beautiful moonlit night..." "...won't let me sleep." Both aunts are furious. Do you know why? Because aunty left this house to you, Chipku. The lawyer's waiting for you upstairs. He'll need your identity card. Do you have one? Yes. See, didn't I tell you? Your luck is not that rotten. - This calls for a party. - Your party's on me. Keep my card. You too. And this I card is for the lawyer sitting upstairs. Go on, he's waiting for you. This is definitely Lallo's doing. I am telling you. She's the one who fed her kebabs in the morning. She had asthma, paralysis, and also sugar problems. And she fed her kebabs. Her sugar must have spiked. Brain haemorrhage, huh? She looks naive, but she's too clever. - I mean it. - I mean it, yes... Poor Ismat... We couldn't get a final glimpse of her. We couldn't get a final glimpse of her. Don't worry, your case will be handled by a very talented... Very talented... Clever... Young man. Byomkesh Bakshi of our local intelligence unit. He'll handle it. Vikram. Sir. You'll handle their case. Vikram, stop staring at them. They are not the culprits. They are the ones who lodged the complaint. Bahuji's caretaker... Sir...Vikram Kamal is on casual leave today. He'll be back on duty from tomorrow. 'Like I always said, Lallo, don't even rely on fate. Even those without fate lines have a destiny.' I will take good care of everyone. 'How much wood would a woodchuck chuck... ...if a woodchuck could chuck wood?' I can't even call anyone. Even the junk-seller has a touchscreen phone. How much for this book? Room on rent available here Only decent people should apply. I am putting up Bahuji's room up for rent' But how will the tenants contact me? The line's working, but the two aunties took the phone with them. Where will I get a phone? Atma, are you sure we'll find something here? Bahuji had the place cleaned a couple of years ago. Maybe she kept a phone here...somewhere. Found it. Red Fairy... ?? A folding book. Isn't this beautiful, Atma? 'Love never goes out of trend.' 'But stories do.' 'So in this obsolete story part seven...' '...we'll know about a very ancient story.' “…where both the lovers are doomed to die” 'This story dates back to the time when other than kings and queens...' '...even the (the Royal Courtesan) had a place in the society.' Not just kings alone, but kingdoms would be sacrificed in her honour'. Looks beautiful, doesn't it? Do you know who the Red Fairy was? She was a beautiful courtesan... ..and her real name was Shok Sundari. She lost her heart to a conniving dacoit. Shok Sundari left all her riches behind... ...and exiled herself to the jungle with him. But the dacoit was only greedy for her wealth. Shok Sundari pushed the dacoit off the cliff and killed him. And a curse to be forever alone befell her. Whoever would try to get close to her wouldn't survive. The Red Fairy was so ill-fated She must be so lonely, Atma. Unique ways to cook food. Pratap's wife seems pretty talented. Baigan ki Thandai (Aubergine milk shake). Bhindi aur Machli ka Shorba (Fish and okra broth). Daal Lemon Soda (Lemon Soda Lentil). Chawal ki Barfi. (Sweet Rice Cakes) Angoori Kofte. ( Grape meatballs) It will work like magic on Pratap.' A true match made by Sarla. One's blind and the other is a leper. Atma, do I put onions in the soup? Lallo had realised in McNow... ...that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach too. And the way to Pratap's stomach was Sarla's book. Poor Pratap had no clue what our dear Lallo was brewing to get rid of her loneliness. Sarla. in jaggery syrup and....roasted sesame. The perfect way to make sweetmeats. I was trying a different recipe, Pratap. It will be ready in a couple of hours. You may join me for dinner... 19:00 hrs check in at Lallo's house. So she had a roof over her head. The piggybank was broke open. And dinner is finally served Could this be the cure to Lallo's lonely heart? Cold coffee and coriander soup. That's my late wife Sarla. She cooked just like you. But her stomach exploded from overeating... ...and she shut down forever. You and mom can look after the parlour. I'll call you Sarla. I hope you won't mind. You know, every Pratap needs a Sarla. And every Sarla... Pratap. Pratap I'll get you something to drink. "You're my sweetheart." "You're my desire." "I am the cloud," "and you're my sky." "My body sways, and my heart is overwhelmed." "With your love." "My heart's restless," "waiting for you." "you, you, you." "You're my sweetheart." "You're my desire." Out of the frying pan and... Aunty, I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything, aunty. I saw Pratap was choking. Irushed to revive him. I thought... I thought something's stuck in his throat. And the rice... the rice was coming out. So I used my scarf to stop it. But I haven't done anything wrong, aunty. I haven't done anything, aunty. Aunty... Rap song "I want to challenge death." Rap song Rap song Where was he posted before this? No, sir, I won't have dinner today. It's a Friday. "I want to challenge death." Come on. Sir. So young man, seems like you have set up house here? What is all this commotion in my Police Station? It’s Death Metal Death what? I want to challenge death. Oh, I see... Wow, Kamal, that's a good pun - Kamal...Kamaal. - Ek minute. Kamal...Kamaal. I am good at this too. Tell me something, young man. You mentioned in your report that Pratap died of choking. But what did he choke on? The fishbone or was it someone else. And why did the caretaker have to go out of the house to call the ambulance? When there's a telephone line in the house... ...then why waste time running all the way to the PCO to call the ambulance. My opinion is that the caretaker hid the phone while Pratap lay choking to death. Sorry, sir. Any luck in finding a place to stay? Sorry, sorry, sorry... Sorry, I'll come back later. - Vikram. - Yes. - I'll come back later. - No, it's okay. Did you want to ask something? Yes... Then ask. It's about the people who live in the house or frequently come here. She is very naive. I see... She was only 20 when the master brought her here to work. Okay. She is lonely. By the way, are you single? Lallo, go see who that is. Yes? The room. Pratap's was in the hall' No. I am the tenant. Oh, I see, you're the tenant. Would you like some tea? There's no milk. I can only offer black tea. ?? It just got installed yesterday. Phone... It's new. I mean I just installed it in the room but it's an old phone. Bahuji had kept it safely in the attic. The room... Oh yes. Just a minute. This is your room. And that's my lemon plant. Even she has a guest. Look... And there's a common bathroom. Not in that manner. I mean there are two doors. So...be careful. It's pretty strong. So... shall I take that tenant notice down? I don't have a spare key. You can keep my key. I'll arrange for another one. Yes, Prem Gunjan. I've found a tenant. He's a policeman. Yes, his room is separate. No... Yes, he looks decent. Listen, I want the other set of keys that you have. I'm trying to save on small expenses. No, he doesn't know the house is falling apart, yet. No, Gunjan, there's no question of borrowing money from you. No, let's skip lunch. Fish. I'll never eat fish again in life. Me? I like McNow. He just found out about the flush. He doesn't know that the geyser, sinks, dripping water, light in the gallery, gas lighter, window shutter are all in a bad shape. Oh yes, the keys. Tomorrow at 4. Bye. Bye.

All her lovers die one by one. And it's happening with me as well. Red Fairy... I want to know everything about the Red Fairy. If only I was still alive I would've warded off the evil eye on Lallo myself I wonder if Lallo will come across true lovers in her life But Laliya, be careful of this unwanted attention. The entire world has an evil eye. Lallo is restless. Just like a drowning man, clutching at a straw... ...she's arrived at the city library... ...and the in-charge here is also the famous astrologer of the city... ...the psychic, multipurpose lady. Maybe she can guide Lallo I'm looking for books on fairy... Sister, you're being chased by a ghoul. Not ghouls! I want to know about fairies. Ghouls feed on peoples' weakness and insecurity Yes, there's a ghoul with me but I want to know about the Red Fairy. Why don't you understand? Why doesn't anyone understand what I am saying? Chotu! Madam, your scarf. You left your... “Here comes trouble” “Here comes trouble” Red Fairy... I am the Red Fairy. Lallo. Lallo. Atma. Where are you Atma? Why did you leave me? Go away. For God's, sake go away. Your life is in danger. No, not that. Eat this instead. Bengal grams. Makes me constipated. Lallo, if you have a problem you can tell me. Problem. It's not a problem. I am doomed. I am unlucky. I don't know anything about stars and planets... ...but I do know if the right person is stuck at the wrong place at the wrong time... ...then even he's considered a criminal. If this was happening recently, then I would've admitted that I am not lucky. But everyone's left me alone since I was a kid. Just like the Red Fairy. I've a question... Have you read the book? Till the end? Yes, once. Do you fully believe in this book? Yes, my fate is the same as the Red Fairy. Someone barely lays eyes on me, and he is dead You're lucky that you don't feel that way about me If you did had grown a little emotional, then' I am asking you again did you read this book till the end? Yes, I did the first time. And I gaze at the picture everyday See how beautiful it is. You remember the picture, but not the story. Nothing heals better than love. Only true and selfless love can mend the Red Fairy's, broken heart. And as soon as that happens her curse will turn into a boon. So maybe the Red Fairy's curse was finally broken in this last torn page. And my curse will too. A true lover. Now I just have to find him. Well...look here. What is this? Guru... Disciple. Guru...Disciple. It's pretty ordinary... But definitions change as soon you change your point of view. - So then God' - 'is in the details I have something for you This... Where did you find this caterpillar? From a crime scene. Your caterpillar is alone. They can keep each other company from now on - Hello. - Byomkesh, where the hell are you? Just leaving from home, sir. You've become quite the homebody these days Yes, sir. Come down to the station immediately. And don't forget to get some lemon for my tea. - Lemon? - Yes. Okay, sir. Sorry, sorry, I know you called several times... "You called and I..." "...and here I am." Listen... what. What? Are you going somewhere? Let's go inside for a minute, please. Suhani, please. I have to pee urgently or I'll pee in my pant. Suhani! I am serious about you It is over with Zoya! Suhani! Respected, Vikram. I owe my heart to someone else. Please forgive me if you can. I hope you will try to understand. Your almost wife, Kamal. It's working. Vikram... Vikram. Prem Gunjan. What... - What... - I was just... Did you come to fix the flush? And you're secretly doing repairs around the house. What happened to her? - Who? - Lallo. Who is this? It's me. Lallo I mean... Lallo, you're looking extremely beautiful. Don't say such things about me. - If anything happens to you... - I'll deal with whatever comes my way. What do you think will happen? - For me? - Yes. Why not? By the way, what are your plans for the evening? - Would you like a cup of tea? - Tea? How did tea come into this conversation? This evening you and I are going to a party. 8 o'clock, sharp. Fantastic. A pendant to find true love. This thing...it does nothing. True. It is...nothing. Zoya, your husband was looking for you somewhere over there. My husband isn't even in town. Okay. Why didn't you come over? Wasn't that your girlfriend from McNow? Yes... Several girls like her are dead crazy about me, not my problem. Don't talk about dying. I'll be fine. And she was my girlfriend. But she isn't anymore. And I won't die today' it's my birthday after all. It's your birthday today. Hmm. Why didn't you tell me? I could've got you something. We're here together and that's good enough for me. Cheers. What happened? Don't like the place. It's not great Why didn't you tell me earlier? Let's leave. Come on. Come on. So as you can see...I survived. Would you like some tea? Prem. Prem. Prem. Prem... Prem... Prem... - Did I scare you too much? - I thought you are... Dead. I would be. But you called out to me so lovingly I had to come back down. Look, Prem, don't ever play such a prank on me again. Look, Lallo, don't ever ask me for tea again. Careful...aunty. Good music but not for dancing. I'll play something. Romantic song plays Romantic song plays Romantic song plays Romantic song plays Prem, I... I can't do this. Okay, I won't do it. It's okay. It's also pretty late. I'll see you. Prem... Yes. I know you've helped me a lot. First, you helped transfer this house to my name. Then you secretly repaired the place. The water dripping from the sink, window shutters, geyser, gas lighter. You fixed everything. Without telling me and without any selfish intentions. You have done a lot. I know you want to get close to me. Maybe even I was waiting for this day. Because I hoped to find love first... but even that turned into a curse. I don't know whether I'm unlucky, the Red Fairy, or just unfortunate. But...if anything happens to you because of me... For my love to find its true love at the right time, you must wait. Only true love can break this curse of loneliness. I understand. I'll leave. What is Manglik? Poor loveless Lallo so desperately looking for love might just find love in the end. Well... Wait and watch what happens next. Hello. Zoya. What is it? Wait a minute. Come over now. But now is... Zoya...?? Prem... 'Mangalyaan. (Mars Orbiter) Because you're from Mars. Would you go on a journey of the galaxy with me?' 'For my love to find its true love at the right time, you must wait.' Now? But I've a show now. How can I leave my show? Urgent, huh? That will be extra, in cash Only true love can break this curse of loneliness. Lallo. Lallo. Lallo. I am coming. Wait a minute. Gunjan... Prem, no more pranks please. Prem! Prem? Madam, if we believe you then Bahuji's death was an accident. Then Pratap... Swallowed a fishbone. Then Sunil...took Shilajit(energy) pills. Their crimes were just an accident. And now Prem Gunjan... Someone killed him for no reason...right outside your door. Why is it that people around you land up dead? And Vikram... Who will take responsibility for that accident? I am the Red Fairy. Cursed. Destined to be doomed. But if anyone tries to get close, he'll meet with the same fate. Someone turn off this noise. What were you saying? You're a fairy. Do we look like ghouls to you? That poor Vikram is dead because of you. You're definitely playing a some big game, madam. Mr. Vikram Kamal, you're still alive. Reduce one murder charge against her. Sir, please... Go on. Lallo is innocent, sir. Innocent? Again? Sir, these are the murderer's fingerprints. The prints were on the staircase as well. We just need to tally them with our database. And this is Lallo's phone details. There were no calls made at the time of Gunjan's death. Nor the two weeks before that. What is this? These are Lallo's sandals. Sir...I am taking Lallo home. I hope you understand. Go on. Do you want anything to eat? Shall I make tea for you? Anything at all. No. I want a croissant from McNow. You're not alright. I cannot leave you alone right now. No... I am fine. Vikram, you did a lot for me. One last favour. What do you mean last favour? I'll get it as many times as you want. With mozzarella cheese. Amul is fine. Atma? "You're my sweetheart." "You're my desire." Am... Am I dead? Absolutely. 100% confirmed dead. And you can speak. Speak, I can even sing here Are you from across the river? Forget the river bank and know this... ...you won't find anyone who will love you more than I do. Neither in that world nor over here. Lallo. Hello. Lallo... Lallo. So my new dress enchanted you too. Have you lost your mind? Since the day you picked up my phone I latched on to you. With a twist. Look Atma, don't even think about falling for me. You know I am the Red Fairy. I want to challenge death. My point exactly. That you're the Red Fairy and I am your salvation. Ultimate lover! Ghoul! But in the Red Fairy book... Yes, it was written in the book that all her lovers die. And just like Shok Sundari committed suicide, so did you... But Shok Sundari's lover betrayed her. Prem wasn't like that at all. Prem Gunjan. He was sleeping with Zoya, you fool. Hello. Is your name Joker? Urgent, huh? Prem... It's pretty ordinary... But definitions change when you change your point of view. Vikram. Do you know the end of the story? Yes. The Red Fairy commits suicide. like the Red Fairy, I have no hopes of finding true love. I am your true love. I've been attached to you like your shadow for 10-years. I've seen everything, your good and bad. Look Atma, don't even think about falling for me. I don't know what may befall if a ghost falls in love with me? - You're my only friend... - Friend? Friend? I am not your friend. I love you. I know that you're thinking about Vikram. But his time has come. Just like everyone succumbed to their death one by one. He won't survive either. You you killed everyone just for my love? Of course. Of course. And my first victim was not some lover... ...but that stupid Bahuji who put this idea of a prince charming in your mind. Still don't get it? God... No, I... The library guy, the junk seller, the postmaster...all of them. But that cop of yours... He's a tough guy. He loves you a lot. Atma, I must go. For the first time in my life, I've come across someone who truly loves me. No Romeo can take my love for me. And listen carefully... forget all about that cop Delete him from your memory... Otherwise, whatever life is left in him... Atma, please don't harm Vikram. What if I accept you and stay here with you? Will you... Yes. Yes. Yes. Then the constable will live to see his retirement from the force Promise. Okay...I will stay here with you. Let Vikram go. Vikram. Vikram. Vikram. ?? So the missing page said that Red Fairy herself would have to love him selflessly... ...only then can the curse be broken. 'Finally, Lallo found her ship of dreams... ...on which, along with her prince charming, she's going to her childhood home. Oh, God... Lallo's boatman is Atmaram version 2.0!' He has nowhere to go now. He's stuck in the middle. But Atma will never mend his ways. Don't worry, Laliya. So what if I am dead but I will be your guardian angel for the rest of your life. That's my promise. And you...I will see you. I mean we'll meet again. Don't be scared.
