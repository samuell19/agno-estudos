That's the lot, gentlemen. - Gabriel Oak, is it? - Uh-hunh. I thought you worked out at Norcombe. Well, I've leased a place of my own now. Small, but it's a start. Have you borrowed? Up to here. Good luck to you, Oak. Soldiers! George! George! She says that's enough she's offered you, you great mister, and she won't pay no more! She's got a blasted cheek! Who does she think she is? She's mistress's niece She's a stranger here Well, you tell mistress's niece she'd better shift her backside off that wagon and find another tuppence or mistress's niece bain't gonna pass! Tell him I won't pay him another farthing. Toll keeper Here. Let her pass. Hey, leave them now, boy. Hey, leave them now, boy! - George, come here! Come back when I call you! Come on! That's it. Come on, pup. You've got a lot to learn, haven't you? Lot to learn. I wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do this. Well, we're not, and you'll have to help if you're going to stay. ? They took money and watches and rings of great price ? Then naked they stripped men and ladies alike ? And naked together as when they were born ? They got in the coach for to keep themselves warm ? Gee ho, Dobbin! Hi ho, Dobbin! ? Gee ho, Dobbin! Gee up and gee ho! Hey! Heyah! Come on! I found this hat. It's mine. - It blew off in the wind. - Indeed. - I'm Farmer Oak. I own the... - I was looking everywhere for it. Thank you. I saw you. Where? ln the wood. By the stream and up the hill. - You watched me? - Yes. Well, no. I mean yes. But not deliberate, like. ? Gee Ho, Dobbin Farmer Oak! Farmer Oak! Farmer Oak, wake unp. You left the slides shunt. You could have died. I do believe you've saved my life, miss... I don't know your name. I'd sooner not tell you. I've never liked the sound of my name. You might...soon find you have a new one. Oh... Excuse me. Thank you. I'm sorry. You may have it again if you like. I suppose you were thinking you'd like to kiss it. I wasn't. But I will! No, you won't! Find out my name if you can! My name's Gabriel! I brought a lamb for Miss Everdene. I thought she might like one to rear. She might, though she's only visiting here. Well, she should be in shortly. The lamb...isn't the only reason I came. I was going to ask Miss Ev... Bathsheba... if she would like to be married. Were you indeed? Because if she would, I'd be very glad to marry her. Has she any other young men hanging around her at all? Oh Lord Farmer Oak, ever so many She's so good-looking And clever besides Not that her young men ever come here. But she must have a dozen. That's unfortunate. Well, that was what I came for. Thank you. Good day to you, Mrs Hurst. Hoi! Hoi! Farmer Oak! My aunt was lying. I haven't a sweetheart at all. I've never had one. I'm truly glad to hear that. I have my own snug little farm. And 200 sheep. Well, 400 by the time lambing's finished. It's not all paid for yet, but er... I'll work twice as hard when we're married. Oh, but...I never said I was going to marry you. You run all this way and then say you're not going to marry me? If I wanted to marry you, I wouldn't have run after you. No, I just wanted to let you know that nobody has me as a sweetheart. I hate to be thought men's property in that way. Oh. Well, there's no harm in hurrying after someone to correct a mistake. No. No harm. Well, I'm...I'm not sure it's no harm. Anyway, I hadn't time to think whether I wanted to marry you or not. You'd have gone over the hill. Think, Bathsheba. Will you marry me? I do love you far more than common. I'll try to think... ..if I can, outdoors. You shall have a piano in a year or two when I've paid off the sheep And I'll practise my flute so I can play with you in the evenings. I'd like that! And we can announce the wedding in the newspaper. I'd dearly like that! - And the babies in the Births, every one! - Don't talk so! And at home by the fire, whenever you look up, there shall I be. And whenever I look unp...there will you be. It's no use. I don't want to marry you. I can't. Why not? Because I don't love you. But I love you. It wouldn't do, Mr Oak. I'm too independent. I need somebody to tame me. You'd never be able to do that Who says I couldn't? Don't give me your answer right away. Let me call on you. No. I don't love you, so it would be ridiculous. Then I'll ask you no more. - - Mr Everdene. Mr Everdene! Fanny, fetch the doctor! Runn for the doctor! Help him! Get him indoors! Look after him. Who'll take over the farm? He don't have an heir, do he? There is the niece. His brother's child. What will a young girl do with a farm? Bathsheba. You've got a letter. You read it, Aunt. Good God! I think it means you're to be mistress of Weatherbury Farm! Whoa, there! Liddy! Liddy! Thanks be to God I am not married. It's all there. I sold my hunt. I sold everything. I thought you were insured. I gave all I had for the sheep. What have you left? Nine shillings and six pence. - Bailiff? - Aye. Whose farm did you last manage? My own. Your own? If he can't keep hold of his own farm, he's not going to manage mine. I'm looking for a man who works hard and doesn't complain. I'm your man, sir. No-one hired thee, shepherd? - No. - Me neither. Thou should try the fair tomorrow at Shottsford. 'Tis bigger than this. T'other side of Weatherbury. Thank you, sir. Fire! Fire! Runn! The rick's on fire! Fire! Fire! The ricks are on fire! Where's the bailiff? Where's Pennyways? Bailiff! Pennyways! Hey, not that rick! Save the barn! If these catch, you'll lose the barn for sure! Have you got a tarpaulin? Get a tarpaulin! We need a ladder! Have you got a ladder? Get a ladder! We need water! Got any water? Get some water and some beaters! And some branches if you can. Put your end down! Stretch it out, lads! Get your end over there! You pull your end out now! Pull your end out! Make a chain! Make a chain! That's right! Get the tarpaulin between the fire and the ricks! Keep it covered with water! The more water the better for the tarpaulin! On here! Right up! Oh don't mind me! Oh this side! Oh this side! And that side! Fire! Fire! Jan Coggan! Billy Smallbury! Fire! Fire! Fire! Give it here! He's a bit late in the day! More water! More water! More water! More water! - Maryann fetch the stranger - Yes. The barn is saved, ma'am. Do you want a shepherd, ma'am? Uh... Do you want a shepherd? I-I do want a shepherd, but... He's the very man, mistress! If the rick had gone, the barn would have followed for sure. - 'Tis this shepherd done most good. - He's all there, ma'am, so he is! Tell him to speak to the bailiff. Will you all come up to the house for something to eat and drink? We could take it freer, ma'am, if you sent it over to Warren's Malthouse. Of course. Good night to you all. - Good night, mistress. - Thank you. - Well done, shepherd. - Good work tonight! - We put it out, didn't we? - Well done, shepherd, well done. Aye, I'll be right along. Who's there? Am I on the right way for Warren's Malthouse? It's at the bottom of the hill. Do you know how late the Buck's Head keeps open? I don't even know where it is. Why, are you going there tonight? Not a Weatherbury man? No. I've just been made shepherd. Only a shepherd? You seem more like a farmer to me. No. Only a shepherd. Please, don't say anything in the village about seeing me. I don't want people to...to know. I won't say owt if you don't want me to. - Are you all right? - I must go. Here... Do you need this? It's only a shilling, but it's all I can spare. Thank you. Remember...tell no-one you saw me. Did you see the way that blasted Pennyways came in at the end and took all the credit? He's neither use nor ornament! Why the Master ever made him bailie when there's gifted men willing... He'll be able to do what he likes. She don't know her pretty arse from elbow. Pretty arse, mind! Ah! 'Tis the shepherd! - You done good work tonight, shepherd! Come in! Be welcome... though we don't know your name. - Gabriel Oak, sir. - Clean cup for the shepherd! Oh, no, not at all. Mug'll do. Don't fuss over dirt in its pure state. Here's a mouthful of bacon and bread from mistress. Thank you kindly. So, you have a mistress, not a master? Aye. That's the way of it. What's she like to work for? It ain't never Gabriel Oak's grandson, from over Norcombe? Aye, I am. Hee! I knowed your grandfather! Hoo! I remember Norcombe very well. I worked there quite a few years, with my son Jacob there. Didn't I, Jacob? Course, mind you, that was before my grandson William got on to man's wages. You must be a very ancient man to have two such sons. Grandfather's so old he can't mind his proper age. He be no age at all! Why, that jug be older than him! You're a very old and aged person, maltster. Take no notice of yon spiteful pixie. And did Miss Everdene's father and mother come from these parts? Aye, but they was townsfolk. He weren't munch to look at, but she were a lovely woman! And is she... Levi Everdene were his name. He were a gentleman tailor worth scores of pounds. Aye, and a celebrated bankrupt! Not at all. He were quite a common man. No, no, no, no! That man failed for gold and silver! You be not long for this world, maltster. - - What's she like to work under? We know little of her. She only showed her face a few days ago. 'Tis hoped her temper be sweet as her face. We'll know all her whim and fancy come payday. Who's to stay around who's to go Maybe Fanny's been burnt in the fire, miss! I think she has a young man in Casterbridge! - Do you know his name, Maryann? - No, miss. - Mistress. - What are you doing? Er... Nothing, ma'am. I'm just clearing unp. - You're stealing my barley! - No, mistress... How dare you! Get out! Get out! You've all got to come up to the house. Mistress is wild! Fanny Robin's gone missing! And she's sacked the bailie for stealing barley. I knew it! I knew him for a thieving rogue. So my question is, who's going to be bailie now? Well, it won't be you, I bet! Fanny Robin can't be found. Does anybody know what's become of her? Pardon me, miss. Don't she have a young soldier courting her? He's right. It's what we heard Jan Coggan, you go and make enquiries in the villages. Billy Smallbury, you go to Casterbridge. Try and discover who the man is and see if Fanny has gone to him. Yes, miss. Well, go on. All of you. Go on! Why are you back being shepherd? What happened to your farm? I lost it. - How? - Oh... Well, I was unlucky. I'm sorry to hear that. I think it best if we keep our previous knowledge of each other between ourselves. I wasn't planning on telling anyone, Bathsheba. Miss Everdene. From now on. Good night. Maryann, stop a minute. - What cheek to come to the front door! Lord, ma'am! It's a gentleman! I can see the top of his hat! Why doesn't Mrs Coggan go? - Maryann, you go! - Oh, mistress, here's a mess! Well, Liddy, you must go. Oh, for goodness' sake! There, Mrs Coggan is going. Mrs Coggan, I er...heard about the fire last night. Is everyone safe? Yes, sir. And the ricks? We lost the best part of one, but it could have been a lot worse. Is the new mistress within? I'll tell her you're here, sir. I'm never up to my elbows in dough, but a visitor do knock on the door! It's Mr Boldwood to see you, miss. Well, I can't see him in this state. Say you're a fright with dust and can't come down. Say I can't see him. That will do, Mrs Coggan. Miss Everdene can't see you, sir. Miss is dusting bottles and is quite an object, that's why 'tis. I only wanted to ask if anything had been heard of Fanny Robin. Nothing yet. But Billy Smallbury has gone into Casterbridge to look for her. I'll trouble you no more, then. Who is Mr Boldwood? A gentleman farmer across the way at Little Weatherbury Farm. Oh. Why would he enquire about Fanny? - Well, mistress, when Fanny... - Pardon me, Maryann! I do believe mistress was asking me! Fanny lost her family when she were but a girl, miss. So Mr Boldwood paid her schooling, got her a place here. - That was kind. - He's good in that way, ma'am. But Lord save us, a hopeless man for a woman! - Is he not married? - All the young women here have courted him. Mary Stockton spent a year on him. He cost Farmer Ives' daughter over ?20 in new clothes. She might have thrown the money in the river. Mr Boldwood never even noticed her! - I've got a penny! - Where'd you get it, Teddy Coggan? Mr Boldwood give it to me. I opened the gate for him and he said, "The new mistress is an old woman, is she not?" And I says, "Yes." Teddy, get in there! Sorry, miss. Sam... Still no news of Fanny Robin. I think we'd better make ready to drag Newmill Pond. Yes, sir. Adam! George! Come on, come on! SAM: Lads! Comme on! Comme on! Did anyone ever want to marry you, miss? Lots of 'em, I dare say. A man did once. But he wasn't quite good enough for me. How sweet to be able to disdain. Kiss my foot, sir! My face is for mouths of consequence! Did you love him, miss? No. But I liked him. And do you still? Of course not. Oh, the Philistines be upon uns. She might cunt us down to eight shillings. Farmer Ives do only pay eight. - She might sack the lot of us! - Eh? Where would I go? I've lived in this village all my life! - Who'll she make bailie? That's the question. - Now's my time! If you say so, Henery. Is it Fanny? I think it's the ewe, sir, that we lost at Christmas. Get rid of it, Sam. We'll make a start on that side next. I don't dare look at her face, such a shy man as I be. You keep your heart up, Joseph. You'll be all right. Any news of Fanny yet? No, ma'am. Nobody's seen her. Well, let's make a start. Joseph Poorgrass, are you here? I be Poorgrass, sir. Speak up. I shan't hurt you. What have you been doing on the farm, Joseph? I do do carting things all the year, and in seed time, I shoots the rooks and the sparrows and helps with the pig-killing. And how munch to you? Please, nine and ninepence, sir. Ma'am, I mean. Quite correct. And uh... here are ten shillings in addition. A small present, as I am a newcomer. - Thank you, ma'am. - That's more than a week's wage! The new shepherd will need a man under him. Who can he have? Young Cainy Ball is a good lad, if Shepherd Oak don't mind his youth. Well, I don't mind. Very well Cainy Ball to be under-shepherd You quite understand your duties, Shepherd Oak? I believe I do, Miss Everdene. Temperance and Soberness Miller. Both women? Yes'm. Here we be. We believe. And what have you been doing? Harrowing, weeding, breaking up the hard earth... Tending the cows and the pigs, saying "Oosh" to the hens when they go upon your seeds, and threshing in the winter time Are they satisfactory women? Oh, ma'am! Yielding women! As scarlet a pair as ever was! - Sit down! - Me, ma'am? Get back to your seat! That's told him! Lost your chance now, Henery! Well? Ma'am, Fanny Robin's run away with the soldiers. - She's a steady sort, isn't she? - Oh she is ma'am. A conscientious maid Her young man's in the 11th Dragoons. They be gone to Melchester. I was told she be gone after 'em. - What's the man's name? - That I can't find out, miss. But I believe he's higher in rank than a private. Cain Ball, you'd better go over to Farmer Boldwood and tell him that. Yes, mistress. Now that most of you are present... Last night I came upon Pennyways the Bailiff, stealing barley from the granary I was going to prosecute him, but I've decided against it. And I won't appoint another bailiff. I'm going to manage everything myself. I don't yet know my talents in farming, but I'll do my best And if you serve me well, so shall I serve you. And don't any of you think that because I'm a woman I don't know the difference between good goings-on and bad. I will be up before you are awake. I will be afield before you are unp. And I will have breakfasted before you are afield. ln short, I will astonish you all. What does she know about farming? She'll put us in the workhouse Next. Jan Coggan. - Evening, ladies. - Evening, sir! - Which girl are you? - Frank, don't you know me? Fanny! What are you doing here? You said I was to come. Well, I said you might. It's a wonder you found me. You didn't walk all the way from Weatherbury, did you? Can you come to me? The bungle has sounded, Fan. I'm as good as in jail till the morning. When will it be, Frank? What? Please, Frank, don't force me to say what ought to be said by you. Well, never mind. Say it. When will we be married? Really, Fan! You coming like this, it's all so sudden! You think me forward. Don't, Frank! I love you, and you told me so many times we would be married and... Don't cry! If I said we will, we will. Will you come to me tomorrow? I'm at Mrs Twill's in North Street I don't like to come to the barracks, there are bad women about. I'll come tomorrow. Good night, Fan. Good night, Frank. Good night. I'll be damned! What does she want, then? She's a powerful woman! Who the hell is she? Must be a farmer! She's got a sample bag! It's come to something, letting women in! She's got a blasted nerve coming in here! A blasted distraction, that's what she is! Well? I'm afraid, miss, the most you can do with this is feed it to the pigs. The best I can offer you is...ooh, 30 shillings a quarter. And I'm doing you a service taking it off your hands. Well, your pigs will just have to do without, then, won't they? This corn is worth 62 and I'll take no less. - Who's the maid? - Mr Everdene's niece. You can't show tender feelings in front of the men, Fan. I'd have been laughed out of the barracks. Come here. You know you're my sweetheart. - Am I? - I have no other. When you said we would be married, did you mean it? Of course I did. I know I'm not... I just want you to be sure in your mind. - Well, if you're having second thoughts... - Don't be foolish, Frank. You know I love you, with all my heart. Oh, Fanny, I do want to marry you. I do. Which shall it be? Church or chapel? Oh, Frank! I'm so happy! - Good morning, Miss Everdene. - Good morning, Miss Everdene. Lid, what is there to do to pass the time on a Sunday? Did you ever find out who you'll marry by means of the Bible and key, miss? Don't be foolish, Liddy. Some believe in it. Fetch the front door key! It's moving. - Who did you think of? - I'm not telling! Did you notice Mr Boldwood in church this morning? No. He's pew's exactly opposite yours, miss. I wasn't looking at him. Well? What did he do? He didn't turn his head once to look at you all through the service. Why should he? I didn't ask him to. Everyone else was noticing you. Still, it is said a woman jilted him when he was young. That's why he's so reserved. People always say that. I expect it's in his nature to be so wrapped up and indifferent to everything. Yes, miss. Rich and gentlemanly, what does he care? Who's that for? Mr Boldwood? No. Only little Teddy Coggan. It'll make a pretty surprise for him. What shall I punt? "The rose is red, the violet blue, carnation's sweet and so are you." Oh, what fun it would be to send it to old Boldwood! How he would wonder! - No, he wouldn't see the humour in it. - I can just see his face! He'd worry to death! Let's toss. Teddy or Boldwood! Oh, no, we can't toss money on a Sunday. Toss the hymn book! There can't be any sinfulness in that! It's more likely to fall open. So, open Teddy, shunt Boldwood. Oh! Mistress! There! T'would upset the solemnity of a parson! - Ever so well, thank you. - Good. - Thank you, Joe. - You're welcome. Adam, George, you carry on with the harrowing on the three-acre. Sam, you finish clearing the top field for the spring corn and take a team up to Durnsey Hill to start ploughing. Yes, Sir. I think it's for your shepherd My mistake. It's for Miss Everdene's shepherd. No. - No, don't worry. I'll take it to him. - Walk on. Liddy! - Has Mrs Coggan lit the kitchen fire yet? - She has, miss. Tell her to burn these, will you, Liddy? Unless the girls want any of them. To think she can go on without a bailie! Never, in all my creeping up, never. Sustenance, Grandfer. We've been working the stables since four o'clock. - I'm as feeble as a thrush. Have what you will. She won't listen to no advice at all! Morning, all. How's your aching bones this frosty morning? Not good. I've been sitting up with Mistress's mare all night. Thirty-five pound she'll lose if that mare dies, Joseph. I hear her tell that her uncle's things ain't no good to her no more. She's buying everything new. Oh, aye. Heavy chairs for the fat, wiry ones for the slender. - A new piano. - Eh? Now what would a farming woman want with a piano? If she fritters away all her uncle's money, it's woe betide uns. 'Tis the toss of the head, the sweep of the shoulder, 'tis the dare of the woman in general! - Aye, neighbour. Got room for two newborns? - Aye, shepherd. Set 'em by the fire. What's up here, then? They've been talking about Mistress's strange doings. What you been saying about her? Well, these old men been pulling her over the coals. But I say, bless her pretty face. Wouldn't I like to do so, eh? On her cherry lips. Who's been speaking against her? Not I. Tis a joyful thing she's no worse, say I. Don't take on so, Shepherd. We're anxious for our places. hf she hoses the farm what's to become of us? She has no knowledge of farming, and no bailiff. I don't know why you should defend her, shepherd. She should by rights make you her bailie, such a fitting man as you for the job. What? Miss Everdene has a right to be her own bailiff. And keep me down as shepherd if she pleases. - Boldwood. - Morning Mr Boldwood, sir. Oak. Oak, I'm afraid I opened this without reading the address. Please excuse my mistake. Easily done, Mr Boldwood. - It's from Fanny Robin. - Fanny? Thank God for that. I didn't know you knew her. Well, I don't, really. I met her on the night I came here, and lent her a shilling. Says here, she's to be married. A Sergeant Troy of the 11th Dragoon Guards. Oh, Fanny, you silly, silly girl! - Why? Do you know this Troy? - He's from these parts. Well, she calls him a nobleman. Yes, well it's said he's the illegitimate son of a lord. He's clever enough, but where women are concerned... I hope, for Fanny's sake, he means what he says. Mr Oak! Cainy says two more ewes have twinned! Oh, all right. Good lad, Teddy. Er... Go inside. Mark the ones by the fire, then follow me on. - Good day to you, Mr Boldwood. - Oak. Oak. I just wanted to ask... if you happen to know whose writing this is. Well, I'd er... I'd say that's Miss Everdene's. Yes, well, it's expected you will try to find out who sent it. That's where the fun lies, doesn't it? Evening, Mr Boldwood. What's up with him? He was hanging around the Small Acre field the other day. - Was Mistress there? - Mm, she was. - - He's sniffing around her? He's never looked at a woman as long as I've known him. Well, he is now. And I know why! But I can't tell. Well, you'd better, else you'll get your head dipped in a cow pat! - She sent a valentine's letter! - To Boldwood? - She never! - Only as a joke, mind. She's not sweet on him. Well, I've heard everything now. She's turned Boldwood's head with a valentine's letter? Come on, Lid. What else do you know? Is she to marry him? She don't want to marry no-one. She's too fond of being her own boss. She don't have to, with all she's got. She will in the end. Every woman does. Cept you, Maryann. - Well, that's not from want of trying. Is Miss Everdene considered...handsome? Very handsome indeed, sir. She was greatly noticed the first time she came, if you remember. - This might set you off nicely. - It's so pretty. You don't want to catch your death in a freezing church. Oh, I'm sorry. Come here. I'm so nervous. Go on. He'll be proud of you. You make a lovely bride. The service has finished, sergeant. - Sergeant Troy? - Yes. Have you witnesses? No. Would you witness a wedding? Would you be a witness, as well? - Is there not a wedding here today? - No. Damn you! Frank! Frank! I thought the one with the tower was All Saints. I was there at half past eleven as you said, and the verger told me I was in the wrong church. I wasn't munch worried for I thought it could easily be tomorrow. You fool! But it was a mistake! Will it be tomorrow, Frank? Damn you! I won't go through that again in a hurry. - But, Frank...when will it be? - God knows. Marry me. Marry me. Marry me... Marry me...Miss Everdene. This one ain't feeding, Master Oak. What's wrong with it? Looks like it won't take the udder. It'll die if it doesn't feed. Well, it'll have to learn. - Runn to the barn and get that bottle and teat. - Yes, Master Oak. You've got to eat. Here, let me squeeze some out, see if she takes the taste of it. Come on. She doesn't like the taste of your finger, Gabriel. Let me try. You go on ahead, Simeon. Yeah. She likes the taste of you, all right. Come on. Suck. Well done. Lydia. Is Miss Everdene at home? No, Sir. She's not. No, of course not. Mr Boldwood. She's in the lower meadow today. She be a suitable wench for ye, Mark. And I'm the man to master her. Woooo! Oh, beg your pardon, Mistress. Morning, Mr Boldwood. - Have you came to watch? - Morning, Mr Booldwood, sir. Good morning, Miss Everdene. Mr Boldwood. Miss Everdene! Good morning. I feel almost too much to think. My life is not my own since I beheld you clearly. I've never seen myself as a husband. Not even when I was a young man. But now, seeing you... ..I feel my present way of living is bad in every respect. I come to make you an offer of marriage, Miss Everdene. Mr Boldwood, I... ..I have great respect for you, but I cannot marry you. But... the valentine letter! It was a joke. I should never have sent it. Oh, don't say it was a joke. I cannot endure it. Mr Boldwood, I...I'm sorry. But you've started something in me. I want you. I want you to...let me say I love you... again and again. Mr Boldwood, don't, please! I can't bear for you to feel so munch and... ..for me to feel nothing. You think I'm too old and set in my ways, but I will change, Miss Everdene. They'll notice we're gone. I had no idea you were going to say this to me. I am wicked to have made you suffer so. Then say you don't absolutely refuse me. I don't love you, Mr Boldwood. I must tell you that. But I may speak to you again on the subject? Yes. I may think of you? I suppose you may. - And hope to obtain you? - No. No, don't hope. Let us go back. - I will call on you tomorrow. - No! - Give me time, Mr Boldwood. - Yes. I will give you any time. - I am happier now. - No. Don't...don't be happy. Oh, I must think. She left. She said you'd not got wed and she left. Very well. Did she say where she was going? Well, she'd no money, so I don't know what she intended. Thank you. Cain, go down to the lower field and catch the bay mare. I'll turn the handle. I need to speak to you, Gabriel. Did the workfolk make any remark about my being in the copse with Mr Boldwood yesterday? Aye, they did. You turn, Gabriel. It makes my head spin. No. You're not holding them right. Let me show you. Incline the edge. That's it. Let go of my hand...please. What was said? That you and he would be wed before the year was out. Well, it's foolish talk and I want you to contradict it. - Well, then, Bathsheba... - Miss Everdene. If Mr Boldwood spoke to you of marriage, I'm not going to lie and say he didn't just because you tell me to. I just want you to mention that it isn't true. I'm not going to marry him. Well, if it isn't true I suppose I could say that. I could also give you my opinion of your conduct. I don't ask your opinion. I just ask you to do what I say. Well, what's wrong with my conduct? It is unworthy of an honourable woman. - I'm glad to see you don't mind my rudeness. - Not at all. My opinion of your views is so low that I completely disregard them. And where in particular does my unworthiness lie? In not marrying you, perhaps? Not at all. I have long given up thinking of that. Or wishing it, either, I suppose. Or wishing it, either. Bathsheba! Oh, you are very foolish. Leading Mr Boldwood on if you don't care for him, is not right. And if you do care for him... ..you should let him know in a more dignified manner than sending him a silly girl's valentine! How dare you speak to me like this! I pay your damn wages! You will go. You will leave this farm at the end of the week. - I'll go at once, if it's all the same to you. - Go at once, then. I never want to see your face again! Oh, Mistress, Mrs Coggan says there's no beef left and will mutton do? Don't bother me with blasted mutton! - Sheep, Mistress! The sheep! - The sheep! - 60! 70! - 59! Have broken the fence! - Have got into a field of young clover, miss. - They be getting blasted. They be dead if they ain't got out and cured. You fools, to come to me first and not get them out directly! When they eat the clover... their stomachs swell unp. They die a painful, horrible death. Get the ones that are still well out, quickly. Come on, boys. What can I do? What can I do? Sheep are so unfortunate. There's always something wrong with them. - There's only one way of saving them, miss. - What? They must be pierced through the side. Oh, can you do it? Can I do it? If you miss by a hair's breadth, the stomach is punctured and the sheep is dead. - There's only one man can do it. - Who is he? Fetch him immediately! Shepherd Oak. Shepherd Oak doesn't work for me any more. Farmer Boldwood will know what to do. No, ma'am. He sends for Shepherd Oak. It be a hollow pipe you needs, miss, with a sharp pricker inside. - Aye, he's right. A hollow pipe. - Aye. That's the machine. Don't just stand here while the sheep are dying! Go and get someone that can save them! Go on! Quickly! Who do she want us to get if she don't want Oak? She don't know. Just look like you're going to get somebody. I won't send for him. I won't. Mark Clark! Get Oak. Take the bay. Tell him to come directly, that I say so! Well? - He says...beggars can't be choosers, miss. - What? He says he will not come unless you request him as befits any woman begging a favour. Where does he get his blasted airs? We'll lose the whole flock. I'll be ruined. Why not ask him softer, miss? I'm sure he'd come then. Gabriel's a true man in that way. Mark...come indoors. Will you stay on with me, Gabriel? Where are you heading for your leave, then, Troy? Wenching in the town? I'm going back to Weatherbury, to help with the haymaking. Haymaking? That's a bit of a lowly occupation for a nobleman. And what would you know about nobility? I do it every year. - So, it's wenching in the country, then. - Give it a rest, Dobbs, there's a good fellow. Not that pretty piece left you standing at the altar? You're not still thinking about her? - Yeah? - I'm looking for work, sir. Country girl, are you? Your shift'll be from six in the morning till ten at night. Wages is five shillings a week. Ain't nothing like working in the fields. You sure you can manage it? - Yes, sir. - All right. She must be marked. She could wander onto any farm if she isn't. Yes, Ma'am. Cainy! She blushes at the insult. Good work, Gabriel. Done well and done quickly. - Cain Ball? - Yes, Master Oak, here I be. Soft as an angel's wing. Good day, Miss Everdene. Mr Boldwood. I don't think I can. I'm busy. You can leave them. They've being doing it for years I'm going to see Mr Boldwood's new flock of Leicesters. Take my place, Gabriel. Keep everyone at their work. Well, if that don't mean matrimony... She'll have less to say for herself when she's wed. A man's hand'll soon quieten her down. I can't see why a maid should take a husband. If she's bold enough to fight her own battles and don't want for a home. - Tis keeping another woman out. - Aye. A woman like me. I don't think you've munch chance with Boldwood, Maryann. But then I thought no woman had. - I reckon he kissed her in the spinney. - It's a lie! She won't marry him. Ah! Neighbour Oak. How knowest? Why don't you just get back to work? Would I be right in thinking you have some foreknowledge of our young mistress, shepherd? I don't think anybody else would know. I wasn't altogether sure myself. I did know her before. When I was somebody. I was not always what I am now. Do you care for her? More than my life, Jan. Ah. She doesn't like Boldwood. I know she doesn't. But he has everything, and I... ..I'm nothing but a common shepherd. That's the way of things, Gabriel. I promised her I'd tell no-one. I'll be as the grave. - Get out from under my feet! Will there be enough meat for everyone, Mrs Coggan? I think there'll be enough to feed a regiment, miss. I don't want to disappoint anyone. I know how well my uncle did these things. Shall I sit here? Gabriel, will you take the bottom seat and tend to duties that end? So, Maltster, how old are you then? Shepherd would like to hear the pedigree of your life. Lord save us, we'll be here till harvest! Well...I can't rightly remember the year I were born in, but I can reckon all the places I ever lived in. I bode in Longpuddle until I were...eleven, then I malted for two -and -twenty year and then, two-and-twenty year hoeing turnips and harvesting... Then there was three years at Cresscombe and now one -and -thirty year, come Candlemas. - How much is that? - Hundred and seventeen. There that's my age! Good evening, Miss Everdene. I apologise for my lateness. Good evening, Mr Boldwood. Gabriel, would you mind moving again and letting Mr Boldwood sit there? Thank you, Gabriel. ? I've lost my love but I care not ? I shall soon have another ? That's better than the other I wonder what Fanny's doing. She was sitting here, this time last year, I remember it well. I wonder if she found her sweetheart. Well, if she didn't, she'll have found someone else to take her fancy. No, she'll be married by now, I reckon. Otherwise, she would have come home, wouldn't she? Does anyone know of an old man, or a crooked one, or any kind of second-hand fellow at all that would suit me? I don't expect a perfect one at my time of life. If I didn't have my bonny Jane, Maryann, I'd take you unp. What about Old Maltster here? His Rebecca's been dead these long years. Don't be daft. She needs a young ram, not an old goat, don't you? Come on, Joseph, you're an upstanding young buck. Maryann's looking for a man. ? I sowed ? I so-oo-oo-o-o-oo-wed ? The se-ee-eds of love ? And I sowed them in... You unruly young scamps! Get home with ye! - Go on, Joseph. 'Twas very taking. - No, I'll sing no more! ALL: Oh! - Will Miss Everdene sing? - Yes, Mistress! Will you play to my singing, Gabriel? ? On the banks of Allan Water ? When the sweet springtime did fall ? Was the miller's lovely daughter ? Fairest of them all ? For the summer, grief had brought her ? And a soldier false was he ? On the banks of Allan Water ? None so sad as she - That's very pretty. - Good night to you all. - I'll stretch my legs. - Good victuals. - I've stiffened unp. - Come on, you little ones. I fear I am too old for you, but I will take more care of you than any man half my age. I will protect you and cherish you with all my strength. God only knows what you are to me. I will try to love you, Mister Boldwood, but I don't want to give a promise tonight. I'd rather wait a few weeks. - But you believe that then... - You say you are going away. I have every hope that when you return, by harvest time, I will be able to promise to be your wife. But remember this distinctly. I don't promise yet. Oh, it's enough. I don't ask more. Oh, Mark! Mark. Evening. Sorry. We got hitched together somehow. I'll soon have you free. I'm sorry. I...I'll unfasten you in a moment. No, I can do it. You're caught fast. Here, let me. Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face. 'Twas unwillingly shown! I like you the better for that rudeness. I must tear your dress if you're in such a hurry. Then please do so and be on your way! - Look at this tangle. - You're making it worse! No, I'm not. I tell you, you are! I'll do it myself. I've seen a good many women in my time... ..but I've never seen one as beautiful as you are. Be offended if you like. I don't care. There. It's done. Sergeant Troy I wish...it had been the knot of knots, which there's no untying. Good night... ..beauty. Good night... ..beauty. ALL: ? He cast another look ? And there he saw the fair, pretty maid beside the watery brook ? And sing, blow away the morning dew ? The dew and the dew ? Blow away the morning dew ? How sweet the winds do blow ? Cast over me my mantle fair ? And pin it o'er my gown ? And if you will take hold my hand then I will be your own ? And sing, blow away the morning dew ? The dew and the dew ? Blow away the morning dew... - No! I've cunt open my arm! You stupid boy, Cain Ball! Go find your mother, Cain. She's in the next field. Mother! Mother! Mother! - Mornin', Sergeant. - Morning, all. Morning, Sergeant. Welcome back, Sergeant. Beautiful morning. Makes a man glad to be alive. Didn't think we'd see you this year. I hear your good wife's with child again since I last saw you. My wife's doings are no concern of yours, Sergeant. Coggan, it's time I taught you to tie a good reefer knot. Morning, Sergeant Troy. - Is Fanny Robin not working this year? - She ran away. After a soldier. They say her sweetheart's in the Dragoon Guards. Do you know him? I know the young man as well as I know myself. There's not a man in the regiment I like better. He's in the same regiment as you? Who is that woman? That's the new mistress Miss Everdene. Not been here five minutes, she sacked the bailie. Thinks she can do everything herself. What's his name? Fanny's sweetheart? Ah, now, this I cannot tell. There is a code of honour among soldiers, you know. Miss Everdene! Good day to you. I had no idea it was you I spoke to the other night. I fear I spoke out of turn. I fear you did. What are you doing in my fields? I've helped your uncle with the haymaking since I was a lad. I hope you don't mind me doing the same for you. I'm not sure. Oh, you're still angry with me because I took the terrible liberty of telling you you're beautiful. I don't allow strangers to be bold and impudent. I take it back. You are an utterly ordinary and unremarkable woman. How's that? You could have passed me by and said nothing. Surely half the pleasure in feeling something is to express it then and there. I'd have done the same if you were ugly! And how long have you suffered from this affliction? Ever since I was big enough to know loveliness from deformity. - Miss Everdene. You do forgive me? - Hardly. I said you were beautiful and I say so again. The most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I can't stand here talking all day. I have a horse dealer coming at ten. What time is it now? You have no watch? No. Here. Take mine. A gift. - I can't possibly take this! Don't be such a fool! - It was my father's. Take it, Miss Everdene. I want you to have it. Please, take it back. I don't even know you. Why would you give me your father's watch? Please. My workfolk are watching me follow you about the field. Temperance, the young sergeant, he didn't say anything about being married, did he? I don't think he's married, Master Oak. He just don't act married somehow. He's a walking ruin to honest girls, that's for sure. He was after giving her his watch. Aye, that was not all he was after giving her. Miss Everdene, good day to you. You're not attempting the bees alone, are you? Have you no-one to help you? No, they're... they're all finishing off the haymaking. Hm. I'll get them in for you. Thank you. You'd better have the veil and gloves, or you'll be stung. Ah, yes, the veil and gloves. You'd better have the hat, too. The hat too, by all means. It's still warm from your head. Oh, you'd better fix that for me. I'm no good at these things. - A little gratitude, if you please, Miss Everdene. - You look ridiculous. Holding this up makes one's arm ache worse than a week of sword exercise. Have you ever seen it? No. Help me out of this, I'm stifled. I shall do it for you. I do it very well. What, now? Well, I don't have a sword now, but...I could get one by this evening. Will you meet me...at Blackridge Hollow? Well...I'd have to bring Liddy with me. I don't see why. Well, I can't meet you on my own. Good heavens, it's only to watch a sword exercise. Anyone would think I was inviting you to some kind of debauchery. Keep an eye out for Miss Everdene, will you, Simeon? - If she needs help, tell Sam not to hesitate. - Yes, sir. I'll be back in time for the harvest. Walk on! Move two feet away from me...and stand still. If you're frightened, I can't perform. I'm not frightened. - Is the sword very sharp? - Not at all. Now, then, are you ready? Still as a statue. - That was...astonishing! - Wait! Your hair has come loose. How did you do that...with a blunt sword? This sword is as sharp as a razor. It could slice a man in two. I've been within an inch of my life. More precisely, you have been within an inch of your life 1 95 times. I never make mistakes. May I keep this? Meet me at the foot of the hill on Sunday evening. I can't. This is terrible dirty work. What I'd give for a young man on a white horse. Hm, my life is blighted for want of chances. I suppose you've got droves of young men wanting to marry you. I was to be married. To a soldier. - Runn off, did he? - No. It was my fault. It's for the best. He was a gentleman. - I'd always be thinking I was holding him back. - You'll find another one! There's a dozen on every corner with their tongues hanging out. That one? It's too big, too wide. Or that one? - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. Would you show me some of your rings? - For yourself, sir? - No, no. For a er...young lady, perhaps? For your wife. Shortly to be. It was the Mistress. She was in the woods with a soldier. - He was killing her with his sword and then... - Teddy! Don't talk such nonsense. Ah, Gabriel, you taking a walk, too? I thought I'd look out for you, as the man who should naturally come to meet you is away from home. Mr Boldwood. I don't quite understand what you mean. Why would Mr Boldwood come to meet me? On account of the marriage they say is due to happen between you and him. Well, they say what is not true. I've given Mr Boldwood no definite answer. But as soon as he returns, I will. I cannot marry him. I wish you'd never met Sergeant Troy. He's not good enough for you. I can but beg you to have no more to do with him. Sergeant Troy need not concern us here. What do you know of him? I mean, do you think he's honourable? I think he has little or no conscience. I'm not saying he's all bad but just don't trust him so completely. I wish you to go. Do not remain on this farm any longer. I don't want you. Go, indeed. What nonsense! How would the farm carry on? This is the second time you've pretended to dismiss me. What's the use of it? I am mistress. You will go. Bathsheba... ..you know that I love you... ..and will love you always. I only mention this so that you know I mean you no harm. Beyond that I punt myself aside. But I beg you to consider. If you care for your reputation as I do... ..be more discreet towards this soldier. Gabriel, will you leave me now? I don't order you as mistress. I ask you as a woman. You came. I didn't intend to, but...Mr Oak might have come upon you. I met him on the path. What has Oak to do with me? I fear no Oak, nor any other man. - Let's walk a while. - Just for a moment. God, you are beautiful. Don't. Bathsheba, I must go away for a short time. It's only to Bath. Don't look so anxious. No, it's not... I have other things on my mind. - I can't explain. - Come, now. Give me a happy face before I go. No, no! I'm sorry. I...I couldn't help myself. And neither, I think, could you. "Dear Mr Boldwood... ..Now that I've had the time to reflect... ..and honoured though I am by your intentions to me, I feel it would be dishonest and unfair..." He's aiming way above himself, if he's aiming at her. He has nothing but his handsome face to commend him. He's a rakish man, or so people say. 'Tis well for her that Boldwood's away. She'd be better sticking with him. I wouldn't like to see Troy in charge of a farm! He's after two things, and one of them lies under her skirts! Well, I swear to God, he can go under my skirt any time he likes! Who were you talking about? What was passing was a bit of a word about yourself and Sergeant Troy, miss. I forbid you to say such things. You know I don't care for Sergeant Troy. We know you don't, miss. I hate him. He's a fast man. He's not a fast man! What is it to me what he is? Get this to the post! Now, here's a turn. I'm sorry we mistook you, miss. I did think you cared for Sergeant Troy, but I see now you don't. People always say such foolery. But if anyone says another word, I'll tell them, "Of course a lady like Miss Everdene can't love him. He's far beneath her." But, Liddy, can't you see? I love him to distraction. Oh, mistress! What about Mr Boldwood? I've got into such a mess, Liddy. I've written to Mr Boldwood and...refused him. Don't worry, miss. He's away till harvest time. Miss Everdene, are you afraid of me? Mr Boldwood, good evening. Don't throw me off now. I don't throw you off. I never had you. I didn't let myself believe. I only hoped. That evening, at your home... Where have all your pleasant words gone? Your hope to be able to love me? Really forgotten? Oh, you must be heartless. Bathsheba... ..say you only wrote this refusal to me in fun. Say it to me. It would be untrue. I don't have the loving nature you think I have. Oh, you have love enough. But it's turned somewhere else, and I know where. Oh, why did Troy not leave my treasure alone? Before he came, you would have accepted me. - Can you deny it? - No. No! I had you! But he stole in while I was away and...and...and robbed me! Well, go and marry your man! Go on! Don't speak to me like this! I'm only a girl! Dazzled by scarlet and brass! It is unmanly of you to attack a woman like this! - I have nobody to fight my battles for me. - But you have. You have the dandy in red. Has he claimed you for his? Has he kissed you? He has kissed you! Dear God in heaven, kissed you... ..when I would have given worlds to touch your hand. - Then, by Christ, I will kiss you, too. - No, no, Mr Boldwood. Don't! You're a decent man. Act like one! - Curse him. Curse him! - Don't call evil down on him. Don't! I love him, I...can't help it. Bathsheba, forgive me. Forgive me. I'm blaming you, when he is the sinner. He has stolen your heart with lies and...flatteries. It's fortunate he's gone back to his regiment. Bathsheba, don't let him come into my sight... ..for I may be tempted beyond myself. Master Oak! Master Oak! You're left in charge of the farm! Mistress is gone! It's Cainy Ball. He's got his best clothes on. He's had a holiday cos he cunt his arm open. Too right. A broken leg allowed me to read The Pilgrim's Progress. Aye. My father punt his arm out of joint to have time to go courting. Cain Ball, how many times have I told you not to run while you're eating? You'll choke yourself, lad. I've been to Bath. And I've seen...our mistress. - Yeah, and? - She were walking. - - Here's some cider. That'll cure you. It's gone up my nose! Let the boy be. He's always had a bad cough. - Somebody bang him on the back. - Yeah. Now, you just tell us what happened, lad. Come on. I saw our mistress and a soldier... go into a sort of park-like place. And he put his arm round her waist. And they got closer and closer, like a courting couple, And I think the soldier was Sergeant Troy. She's lost her name good and proper now! - She ain't nothing better than a... - Fray, hold your blasted tongue. They sat down and started talking. Sort of serious, like. And mistress was crying. Almost to death! Are you sure it was her? As sure as sure. - Then what? - I never saw mistress no more after that. MARYANN: She'll wish her bread dough, if she's ever intimate with that man. She's not. I'm sure she's not. Wait now. He's no coarse, ignorant youth. He was well brought up, ha a sweet way with words. It was only wildness made him a soldier. - And maids do rather like your man of sin. Don't take on about her, Gabriel. What difference does it make whose sweetheart she is, since she can't be yours? It's not me I fret for. It's her. Mistress! Oh, miss, you're back! We were that worried, we didn't know what had happened to you. I'm sorry, Liddy. I didn't have time to explain. But I'm back now and I'm staying. - Miss Everdene, Lydia. Will you tell her... - My mistress cannot see you, sir. - Good night. - Good night, Sergeant. Sergeant Troy? Yes? I'm William Boldwood. I wish to speak with you. What about? About a woman you have wronged. - I wonder at your impertinence. - Wonder or not, you're going to talk to me. I know about Fanny Robin's attachment to you. She is an orphan. She has nobody to look out for her but me. - You should marry her. - I suppose I should. - Indeed I wish to but I can't. - Why not? I'm too poor. Troy...I propose a business transaction with you. I was engaged to Miss Everdene before you came along. - No, not engaged. - As good as engaged. - She might have become engaged to you. - Damn might! If you'd not come, I should certainly have been accepted. Look, Troy,, you must know this...dalliance with her cannot end in marriage. Now, marry Fanny Robin. She's more suitable for you. And I'll make it worth your while. Oh, yes? I will give you...?50 tonight. Fanny shall have ?50 to prepare for the wedding and ?500 on her wedding day. So, Sergeant, take up your carpet bag, turn around and leave Weatherbury tonight. How do you know I won't just take the ?50 and then not go through with the wedding? I know I can't appeal to your honour, but I think I can appeal to your shrewdness. ?500 is...is a lot of money to throw away. Frank? - Frank? Is that you? - I must go to her. - No! Leave straight away! - I can't go without telling her! - She'll only yearn after me. - Well, keep it brief. - Frank, you're so late. - Oh, God. You knew I would come. How could you doubt it? Liddy's gone to her grandfather's and I've packed the girls off too. We've the house to ourselves. Go on upstairs. I'll be in your bed in five minutes. You see my dilemma? I can't marry both of them. Now, I'd rather marry Fanny because I like her best on the whole. And of course, you make it worth my while. - I've a mind to kill you! - She won't thank you for it! Marry Bathsheba. I give her unp. She must love you indeed. Oh, I thought you were concerned for Fanny. Marry Bathsheba, Troy! Don't desert her! I'll pay you ?500 on your wedding day. And am I to have anything now? I've... Look, I've ?20 here. But I must be certain you will marry her. You must sign a paper. I'll go straight to her parlour and I'll sign. She must know nothing of this! Come to my house. She's waiting for me! Wait there. I'll get paper. Do you think I would break in? You are a ridiculous man, Boldwood. I'm no angel, but I don't buy and sell women. Married? Fanny left me long ago. I don't even know where she is. You say you love Bathsheba, yet on the merest evidence, you believe her to be little more than a whore. There. Now that I've taught you a lesson, you can take your money back! I will not. I will not! I'll punish you, Troy. I'll punish you yet! It's the first time I've had a real home. I belong here. This is mine. I've never belonged anywhere. I thought I'd find a niche in the army but... What about your family? My mother was French. She was governess to the Earl of Severn's children and... ..mistress to the noble Earl. They married her off quick as lightning as soon as I was on the way. - The watch? - The watch was his. It was given to me when I came of age. It was my only inheritance. Cedit amor rebus. The motto of the Severn family: love yields to circumstance. - Did you know him, the Earl? - He never claimed me. I only saw him once. He paid for my schooling. So this is what I am, Bathsheba. A bastard...destined never to belong anywhere. If we have a son...the watch will go to him. He will know who he is. - Good morning, comrades. - Morning Sergeant She has married him, then. Say good morning. You don't need to mean it. This is a gloomy old house. I intend to brighten it up a bit, make the place more modern. We must be cheerful while we can. Oh, Coggan, do you know if there is any insanity in Mr Boldwood's family? I once heard that an uncle of his wasn't right in the head, but I don't know the truth of it. Ah. Well, never mind. I shall be down in the fields with you in a few days. I won't stand on ceremony. Here's half a crown to drink my health. Well, I won't take any gifts from him. Cain, tell the sergeant there's a storm coming. If the ricks aren't covered, they'll lose them. Tell him it's serious. Sergeant Troy says it won't rain and you're not to bother him with such fidgets. Marry me? Friends, not only do we celebrate the harvest in safe and well tonight, but this is also a wedding feast. A short time ago, I had the happiness to lead this lady, your mistress, to the altar. We've not yet had a chance to celebrate our marriage...publicly. So to celebrate in style, and so that every man will go to bed happy, I've ordered brandy and kettles of hot water to be brought. Yeah! A treble strong measure for every guest! No, no, Frank. They've had enough of everything. We don't wish for no more, thank you, Sergeant. Nonsense! Friends, friends! We'll send the women and children to bed, and we cockbirds will have a real celebration by ourselves. And let any man who shows a white feather look elsewhere for his winter's work. Is that you, Frank? He's in the barn! Can I do anything to help? If you don't mind climbing the ladder in the dark, you can get some more reeds up to me. - Can we cover them before the rain starts? - Aye, if we're quick about it. He promised they'd be seen to. - You'd better go down. Gabriel...I suppose you thought when I rushed off to Bath that night... ..it was to marry Sergeant Troy. I did, at first. And others thought so too. - Well, it wasn't. I went there to end it. But...when I was coming away... ..he said he'd seen a woman that morning that was more beautiful than I was. That he couldn't promise to be faithful unless I became his at once. So...between jealousy and distraction... ..I married him. Oh, Bathsheba. He wasn't to blame. It was perfectly true about him having seen someone else. You go back in the house. I'll finish up out here alone. Thank you, Gabriel. Thank you a thousand times...for everything. I overlooked the ricks this year. The best part of your harvest, sir. Things have gone rather wrong with me lately, Oak. I was hoping to get a little settled in my life, but... ..some way my plan's come to nothing. I dare say I am a joke about the parish. Not at all, sir. Not with me. Oak... ..I can't fend off my miserable grief. No. Whatever they say, there was no jilting on her part, really. She never promised me. Really, it was nothing. The whole thing was made more of by other people than it ever was by uns. It was nothing. Good morning to you. Sir. If she hadn't fallen at the last fence, I'd have cleared ?200 easy as looking. It's foolish to throw away my money like this, Frank. Promise me you won't go tomorrow. If it's a fine day, I was thinking of taking you along. I'd run a hundred miles the other way, first. You've lost all the pluck and the sauciness you used to have. If I'd known what you were under all your boldness, I'd never have... Please, do you know what time the Casterbridge Workhouse closes at night? I don't know. - Oh, you poor thing! - Stay where you are. Walk on up to the top. I'll see to her. - You? - Go on! Frank? - Frank, is it really you? - I looked everywhere for you. I thought you were miles away. I thought you were dead. - Why didn't you come to the barracks? - I couldn't. -You were so cold to me at the church. - Oh, Fanny, I was angry. I came to your lodgings but... You're not well. - Have you money? - No. You can't go to the workhouse. Here's what I have. Damn it, it's only pennies. I left the army, Fan. I only have what my wife gives me, now. I can do nothing better. Go there just for tonight. Are you all right to walk? I'll meet you in the morning at 10, on Grey's Bridge. Now, Fanny, you won't get it wrong, will you? 10 o'clock. - I'll bring all the money I can. - Frank... What is it? Nothing. Oh, Fanny, I'm so sorry. I can do nothing more now, but I will. I promise you. - Do you know her? - No. - I think you do. - You can think what you damn well like. Would you let me have ?20, Bathsheba? For the races again? Don't go, Frank. - Stay home with me today. - It's not for the races. What is it for, then? You worry me with these mysterious responsibilities. And you worry me with all these suspicions. Don't go too far, Bathsheba, or you may have cause to regret something. I do that already - What do you regret? - My romance has come to an end. All romances end with marriage. Must you be so smart at my expense? You are dull enough at mine. I believe you hate me. I don't hate you. I hate your faults. Let's stop this bickering. We'll strike a bargain with the ?20 and be friends. If you must have it, take it. I suppose I'll be gone before you're in from the farm. I promised to meet someone. There was a time, not so long ago, when it would have taken a good many promises to drag you away from me. I was sweeter than all your other pleasures then. Whose is that hair? - It's yours, of course. - Liar! I'm not. I'd forgotten I had it. - That hair is yellow! - It's not! Don't insult me. The hair is yellow. Whose is it? You're my husband! You shouldn't keep other women's hair! - Tell me the truth, Frank! - Don't be so desperate! Dear God...help me. Joseph What's the message? 'Tis a sombre one, mistress. You'll never see Fanny Robin no more. She's dead in Casterbridge workhouse Fanny's dead? Mr Boldwood is sending a wagon to fetch her home. And Parson Thirdly will bury her at four o'clock this afternoon. No, no, Fanny's my responsibility. You shall fetch her, Joseph. Use the new wagon with the red wheels. Wash it down. Take some greenery from the garden. Make it pretty for her. I'll do my best, miss. How did she end up in the workhouse, Joseph? Had she been there long? Only since last night, I believe, miss. They say she walked all the way from Melchester and that's what killed her. She would have walked right past here. Why didn't she come home? What time...would she have been on the Casterbridge Road, Joseph? Some time yesterday evening, I reckon. - Yesterday evening. - Aye thereabouts You'd better go, Joseph. Right you are, then, Joseph. Come on. - Liddy? - Yes, miss. What...colour was Fanny's hair? Why, it was golden, miss. Long golden hair, she had. People often remarked on it. 'Tis a terrible thing to die in a workhouse. I hope I never had such misfortune. - Her young man was a soldier, did they say? - In the same regiment as Mr Troy. It will shortly be dark. - Where is Poorgrass? - He left hours ago. - What can have become of him? - He passes the Buck's Head. - Oh, no! - Now with Fanny dead in the wagon, surely? Have another drink, Joseph. You'll have another drop. Be twice the man afterwards. You'll whop and slap into your work without any trouble. Well, I thank providence that I've not been away from my drinking. Joseph Poorgrass, you're a disgrace! Leaving a dead woman outside in the dark! - You're drunk as a lord! - No, shepherd, not I. All that's the matter with me... is the multiplying eye. That's why you look double to me. It is too late and too dark to perform a burial with any decency. You can take the body to the house, Mrs Troy, or it can stay here in the church till morning. I'd better take it to the church. No, it's cold and lonely in the church at night. Bring her to the house. It'd be better in the church. Ready for the morning, flowers and all. No. It's unkind and unchristian. Bring her to the house. What's the matter, Liddy? It's just a wicked story, miss. I know it can't be true. They're saying Fanny died in childbirth. I don't believe it. There's only Fanny's name written, look. We would have been told if it were true, wouldn't we, miss? We might. You go to bed. Oh, Fanny. Would to God you could tell me your secret. Well? What is it? Who died? - Let me go! - No! You will stay! Is the child yours? I had a son. No! Fanny Robin was my servant! Don't kiss her, Frank. Kiss me! Kiss me! She is more to me than you ever were! Or are, or could be! And if Satan hadn't tempted me with that face of yours, I'd have found her and married her! Oh, Fanny, forgive me. ln the sight of heaven you're my wife. If she is that, then... ..what am I? You? You are nothing to me. Nothing! Oh, miss! I've been looking everywhere for you. You haven't been out here all night? Is he at home? He left when they came for the coffin. - She's gone? - Mm-hm. Oh, Liddy. Oh! Oh, poor thing! Come in. Come on. You'll catch your death. No! Master Oak called in first thing, miss. He was asking how you were. Did Mr Troy come home? The children say there's a handsome headstone been punt up on Fanny's grave. Don't know who paid for it. Damn you, God. Or Lucifer... ..or whoever you are. - I'm looking for Mrs Troy. Is she here? - I'm Mrs Troy. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, ma'am. Your husband's drowned in Lulwind Cove. No. No. Glad to see you out of doors, Lydia. Your mistress seems quite well after her visit to her aunt. She do, sir. - Cheerful, I suppose. - Yes. Cheerful. - Fearful, did you say? - No, I merely said she was cheerful. - Tells you all her affairs? - She do, sir. I've been with her all through her troubles. Through Mr Troy's...going an' all. And if she were to marry again, I...I expect I should bide with her still. She promises that you shall? No, she doesn't promise it. I...I judge it on my own accord. Yes. I see. When she alludes to the possibility of marrying again, you conclude... She never do allude to it, sir. You needn't take such long strokes, Liddy. Short, quick ones are best. Perhaps now she's her own mistress again, she doesn't want to give up her freedom. She did once remark she thought she could marry at the end of seven years. If she cared to risk Mr Troy coming back and claiming her. She could marry at once, in any reasonable person's opinion, whatever the lawyers say. - Why, have you been to ask them? - Good heavens, no! Good afternoon to you. Thank you for your appreciation for the gallant challenger. Thank you! Gentlemen, Jack remains the champion! Here, I'll have a go. Hold my hat. Right, here we go. Give it to me, old man. The Royal Hippodrome of London proudly presents... Dick Turpin's Ride To York! And the death, nay...the tragic death, of Bhack Bess! - Mrs Troy. - Mr Boldwood. - I hope your sheep have done well today. - Oh, yes, very well. Gabriel has just one dealer left to see. ? Fanfare - What's that? - The show's about to start They say it's very entertaining. I was never allowed to go in those places when I was young. You shall see it. I'll get seats for us at once. No, No, I...I won't stay. I've got a dealer to see in any case. But I'll secure a seat for you alone. Oh, come on, come on. For the first time we've got a real crowd out there. Come on! Are you all right there, sir? Got a comfortable seat, have you? Are you all right, sir, there? You're fine. No bother. That's our mistress. Halt! Friend or foe? Halt! Friend or foe? Halt! Friend or foe? Open the gate, you fool! Dick Turpin's getting away. Go on, open it! Good man! ln God's name, what do you think you're doing? There's a damn creditor of mine out there. If I speak he'll know me. - You've got to talk. They've paid their money. - I tell you I won't. We've still got the rest of the play to do! I'll nod and wink. They'll never know the difference. Joseph Poorgrass, will you get down? You've got to drive Mrs Troy home. Spangled women are coming to get me. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them! Joseph! I've got a dealer to see. - Will you get down from there and get the gig? Hoorah for the multiplying eye! I hope you're not thinking of telling what you've seen, Fray, or I'm likely to strangle you. Everyone thinks you're dead. Well, as you can see, I'm not. How are things on the farm? How's my wife? She's made Gabriel Oak her bailie. He's headman for Mr Boldwood, too. And he's bringing in all these newfangled machines. Says they can do the work of 20 men. So, she's doing well, then. - Are you thinking of coming back? - Maybe. And if I do, the first thing I'll do is sack Oak and make you bailiff. Provided... ..she hears nothing of my present occupation. I'll be your man, Sergeant. Mrs Troy, would you marry again one day? I haven't given any thought to that at all. No, of course not. My husband's death was never proved. I may not really be a widow. I think of the time when you first came here. I was something to you before he was, but... that means nothing. You never liked me. I did. I respected you. - Do you still? - Yes. You know you can marry in six years, without any further proof of his death at all. Yes, I know. If I wait till then, will you marry me? Mr Boldwood, six years! Who knows where we all may be? - Do you want to marry anybody else? - No, indeed. I really don't like to talk like this. Of course not. But just promise that if you marry again one day, it will be me. - I... - No I don't expect love. I mean an agreement between two mature people, that's all I want. - I will consider it. - When? By Christmas. I'll tell you at Christmas. - Get the black silk out, Liddy. - Not the black, miss, surely? You ought to brighten up a little on such a night. No, I'll wear black. People will only suppose things if I don't. I wish I didn't have to go at all. Mr Boldwood will be punt out if you don't. He's spared no expense. He's got fiddlers. The whole village is going! I had no idea he was going to so munch trouble. Leave the dress, Liddy. I won't go. What should I do, Gabriel? He's expecting me to give the promise tonight. I think the real sin lies in marrying a man you don't love. Love is a miserable, worn-out thing with me, for him or anybody else. I fear if I don't give him my word... ..he'll go out of his mind. I believe this. I believe I hold that man's future in my hands. What should I do, Gabriel? Why don't you just give him your promise, then? I think I would. - Is that you, Gabriel? Do you know any late knot in fashion? - I don't, no, sir. - Blast it! My hands are shaking. Can you tie this for me? Are you coming tonight? I'll be along when I've finished up at the granary, sir. Good. - Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel? - That depends. Or rather, an implied promise. I wouldn't answer for implied. It's a word full of holes as a sieve. You've grown quite cynical. Does a woman keep her promise to marry? You know whom I speak of. I have pressed her on the subject and I think that at last she inclines to be kind to me. Don't build too munch on a promise. She's young yet. Gabriel, I called you in on another matter. You've done good work on the farm, and I want to make you a partner. I spoke to the lawyer the other day, but...we can discuss it at your leisure. - I don't know what to say, sir. - Say nothing yet. My intention ultimately is to retire and let you run the business, if you're agreeable. - Then, when I marry, I'll be free to devote my... - We don't know what may happen There's many a slip... If Bathsheba promises to marry me, she will. You don't know her, Gabriel. She never promised that first time. - Good evening. Please go on in. - Good evening to you, sir. Simeon...is that Mrs Troy's carriage? No, sir. Good evening. Good evening to you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. Good evening, Mrs Troy. You do give it? What? The promise to marry at the end of six years. I only want your word. Don't press me too hard. I...I'll marry no-one else. But there is nothing in that promise at all! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, but sometimes my love for you is so... Bathsheba...give a little to me. Very well. If he doesn't return... ..I will marry you in six years. And you'll take this...as a token from me. I cannot wear a ring. I wouldn't have a soul know. Just for tonight. Wear it just for tonight. Mr Boldwood, no. I won't wear a ring. It isn't an engagement in the usual sense. Bathsheba... ..I have waited...and waited. Don't deny me now. Don't. Lydia! Mark Clark! Join in the dancing! Tonight is a night for celebration! Mrs Troy is wanted! Who wants me? 'Tis a stranger, ma'am. Bring him in. Let him join in the revelries. Come in. Come in. A drink for the stranger. Bathsheba... ..I've come for you. Come with me. Come, madam, do you hear what I say? Bathsheba. Go with your husband. Gabriel...Mr Boldwood has shot my husband. You are charged with the murder of Mr Francis Troy. How do you plead to this crime? Guilty. I shot him. He deserved it. The news has come. He's to hang. Oh, Gabriel! What am I to do? How can I live? Mr Boldwood, I cannot be silent. You were provoked! Everyone knows it! You have to let me make a plea in mitigation. She was his wife. Then they will hang you. So, they'll hang me. Do what you like. I shan't be going to the trial, and I advise the rest of you to do the same. 'Twill disturb his mind to see us staring at him as if he were a show. - That's right, Jan. He's sure to hang. - 'Tis her I feel for. Has she been downstairs today? Nor yesterday, nor the day before. She'll go out of her mind if he's not spared. I thought I ought to show you these, Mr Oak. He's always kept it locked. There must be fifty of 'em... ..all labelled for six years' time. "Bathsheba Boldwood"? I do believe, my lord, his mind was unbalanced. He'd let his crops go bad. He'd let his ricks uncovered. - His whole farm was untended. - Thank you, Mr Oak. And there is the further matter of the clothing, my lord. Bought in secret, in distant towns. All carefully chosen and labelled a date some six years hence, and bearing the name of a woman. A woman, at that time, married to another man. This was not, in my belief, a man in full possession of his senses. I reckon he's done for. Miss Everdene! It's confinement at Her Majesty's pleasure. He's not to hang. Oh, Gabriel. Thank God! Thank God. We shouldn't be welcoming this, you know. None of uns. 'Twas bound to come, sooner or later. They won't be needing none of us at all afore long. He's to take over Boldwood's farm. How can he do that? He's not related. That Boldwood had made him a partner. That ain't right! That ain't the law! - What do you know of the law? - More than you. Your head's so fuddled with age and senility, you have to talk out of your arse. I reckon he's slyly biding his time, waiting for his chance to get her. Nah, she'll not marry again. Not after all she's been through. 'Tis something to see, a man so faithful. He don't get nothing back for his devotion. Show more respect for her. She's the one that punts bread on your table, you know. - Thank you. - Thank you. Gabriel! How long have you been there? A few minutes. Have they finished it as you'd wish? Yes Has it really only been eight month? It's like a lifetime to me. Are you going in? I should. I'm in the choir now, you know. - No, I didn't. - I have been for some time. Mrs Troy, I...I wanted to talk to you. I may have to give up the management of your farm. I'm thinking of leaving England. I feel it's for the best. America's...where I've set my mind on. What will I do without you? If that's what you've decided... Goodbye, Gabriel. Good luck. We're going to give it a try in London, miss. Leave the land that you've worked on all your lives? Things are changing, miss. Fact is, we'd like to be a bit freer. No disrespect, but we want to stand up and make our own way in the world. Not serve anyone. Well...good luck to you both. Soberness. I'm sorry to lose you, Mark. Everybody's leaving, Liddy. Mark and Soberness, Mr Oak. That's just like Master Oak. He don't like anyone thinking bad of him. What do you mean? Liddy? Well, miss...people have been talking. - Can I get you a chair or something? - No. I... Gabriel, why are you leaving? I'm going to America, like I said. Don't leave. I can't stay here. People think I'm sniffing about waiting for Boldwood's farm, and in the hope... ..in the hope of marrying you. That's absurd. It's far too soon. Well, it's...it's not what I want. You're the last person I'd think of marrying. It's absurd, as you say. Too soon were the words I used. I beg your pardon, but absurd is what you said, and so do I. I can't manage without you. So you want me to stay on as your bailiff? No, that's not what I mean. Bathsheba! If I only knew one thing... If I only knew... ..whether you would allow me... ..to love you. And to win you. To marry you. If I only knew that. But you will never know. Why? Because you never ask. Why, Gabriel... ..it seems exactly as if I had come courting you. How dreadful! Quite right, too. I've danced at your heels long enough. Miss Everdene. Will you marry me? I will. ? And there he saw a fair pretty maid beside a wat'ry brook ? And sing, blow away the morning dew ? The dew and the dew ? Blow away the morning dew ? How sweet the winds do blow ? Cast over me my mantle fair ? And pin it o'er my gown ? And if you will take hold my hand ? And I will be your own ? And sing, blow away the morning dew ? The dew and the dew ? Blow away the morning dew ? How sweet the winds do blow ALL: Hooray! Thank you. Come and eat and drink with my wife and me, eh? If you'd send it to Warren's Malthouse, 'twould be better for uns. The man has learnt to say "my wife" in a wonderful, natural way, considering how long they've been wed! Thank you. Thank you all. ALL: God bless you, mistress.
