[intense music playing] [boy] I think life's like a game of chess. We hope to checkmate and be winners, but many times, life puts us in check instead. The question is would you accept defeat so easily? My name's Tay. And these people I'm with are Beat, Khung, Zoe, and Wen. We're neither friends nor family. We're not even close. But at this moment, we have the same goal. We will go out and pull off one of the craziest and most dangerous plans ever. We'll make possible an impossible mission. - [truck rattling] - [splashing] [gasps] You jerk! Watch where you're going! [Tay] Honestly, I don't wanna give you spoilers, but one of us might not make it out alive. Uh, why don't you... take a guess who won't make it? Is it your dad's funeral? I challenge you! Wanna fight? Come on! You asshole, I'll get you! - Come back if you dare! - [tires squealing] - Hey, wait up. - Run! Run! Run!

She's a cheerleader. She and I dated a while back. Even if it was just a few months, it truly felt like I was in heaven. [chuckles] [record scratching] [Tay] That's right. I crash-landed hard and I had to face reality. [Pie] I'll call you when I get there. Thank you. [intense sound effects] What? [Tay] The reality in which... ...I'm just a perpetual loser. [crowd applauding] INTER-UNIVERSITY CHESS COMPETITION SECOND PLACE [melancholy music playing] GET RICH LIKE A CHAMP [Tay] I'm a senior studying business administration, living off the government's student loan. I'm like most teenagers on the cusp of adulthood. I grew up in a society where only the rich only get richer. You know, I chose it myself. [Tay] They have it all, they can get anything they want. Meanwhile, the poor become poorer and poorer till they eventually lose everything. [car engine revving] [Tay] My dream is the same as the other poor people of this country. I wanna get rich so I can finally escape the reality of my life. [melancholy music playing] [faint indistinct chatter] But to be honest, I'm actually very close to achieving my dream. It comes once every 16 days. Mom, I'm leaving. Okay. [Tay]This woman's my mom, her name's Toi. I want to introduce you to her more than anybody else. [Toi sobbing] Darling! Please. Please, don't leave me. Wait! Please, don't leave me! Please! [tires screeching] PAVILION OF SADNESS [Toi sobbing] No! Well, as you've seen for yourself, my dad left my mom while she was still pregnant with me. And he left us with... a pretty shitty memory. Then my mom drank to console herself. Although she picked the wrong stuff to drink. - BEST SUPER CLEAN - WHITY BATHROOM CLEANER [grunting, gagging] Well, ma'am, you drank two separate things, first, an acidic liquid, then alkaline liquid. They canceled each other out in your stomach. You're a very lucky woman, you know. What? Oh, and by the way, congratulations! It's a baby boy. - [bell dings] - [baby crying] Huh? It seemed like God wouldn't let my mom and I die that easily. [Tay] My mom said that the moment she saw me, she had an instant spark of inspiration. So she escaped extreme poverty and left Nong Khai to move to Bangkok, where we became averagely poor. Play the lotteries! [Tay] Eventually, she became number one. The best lottery hawker in Si Phraya. She ran her business both offline and online. Not to brag, but her business was going really well! You want with a one-two suffix? And what will it be? Singles or sets? Yeah, yeah, I'll keep them for you. Hey, Tay, put the comic down and watch where you're going or you'll fall in. Eyes on the road. [Tay] Our life started to really pick up then. Things were getting bet ter. We even managed to get a house. Hey, you keep looking at your phone. Watch where you're going or you'll fall into a pit. You never pay attention to what I say. Now go put the food away. [Tay] Even if it is... - [banging] - Shoot. ...slowly falling apart. It's fucked. [keyboard clacking] The roof leaks... - Tay. - Yeah? Do you ever clean your ears? [Tay] And cockroaches are everywhere. - Cockroach! - What? - [whimpering] - [Toi screams] What? Ah! - Mom. - [Toi laughs] [Tay] Despite it all, we were happy. But then it seemed God wasn't done with us. [slow-motion screaming] [loud splash] BANGKOK... A CITY OF GOOD LIFE [Tay] Mom dislocated her hip, so she switched to sewing clothes at home to make ends meet. Hello, ma'am. Good day to you. - Hello, ma'am. - I came to deliver your clothes. Here you go. My son even helped me with this bag. - Really? How lovely. - [laughs] [Tay] I had to take over the dream business from my mom, so every day, I did it after school and on weekends. - Girl, look! - Gosh! - The lottery guy is super handsome. - Let's take a picture. [cell phone ringing] MOM Yeah? I just wanted to tell you not to sell the set of five with a 6-9 suffix ticket. My customers called me last night to reserve them. I already sold four of the set. FIVE TICKETS, 30 MILLION BAHT, 1 NOVEMBER 2022 [Tay] For each draw, I'd stash one lottery ticket for myself, hoping my dream will come true one day, my dream of riches.

Come on, how many of those do you have? - All right. - Yeah, check them. [suspenseful music playing] [officer] How much for each? - It's 80 baht. - Jeez, now that is bullshit. No one sells them for 80 anymore. They're all 120 now. - What? - Come on. [laughs] A hundred and twenty. Here, this is all I have. Okay, I'm off now. Oh. Wait. You are...

[heavy machinery beeping] [Tay] How am I gonna tell my mom without shocking her, that Mee had snatched our lottery tray? But something more shocking quickly followed. [Toi] Hey, Tay! Tay! Son! - Tay! - Mom? What is it? The jackpot has been announced! - And so? - Take a look. 197469 is the jackpot. That's right! [screaming] - So you're saying... - Yeah, damn right! Our tray has hit the jackpot! - Yes! That's right! - Whoo-hoo! - [squealing happily] - [laughing] The jackpot! Whoo-hoo! Hey, I've been selling this for so long, I never thought I'd have the winning number in my tray! I'm gonna take your lottery tray instead. Oh, gosh, I'm so over the moon. Hey. You know what this means? We'll definitely sell all the tickets out next time. - [Toi laughs] - [chuckles nervously] Wait. You have to have a sticker made that's gonna say, "Buy here! We sell tickets that win the jackpot!" - [Toi cackles] - [laughs weakly] Wait a minute. I've sold four of the five tickets, so there should be one ticket left. Hey, Tay, did you keep that one? Or you sold it already? Did you keep it? - Yeah? Huh? - Yes, I did. Ah! Are you serious? Really? [squeals happily] The jackpot! I have won the jackpot! Dang! Dang! I won the jackpot! Do you hear me?

Six million baht! My God! I'm rich now! I am rich! Hey. What's wrong with you? Aren't you happy? Oh, you're happy, you're getting goosebumps. [laughs] Six million! Oh, I'm so happy! Hey, what's up with you, Tay? Huh? Why aren't you happy? Mom... promise not to be upset. Why would I be? We won the jackpot. [chuckles] - The thing is... - Uh-huh? The lotteries... Uh-huh, what about it? Mee and his friend took the tray. [descending violin notes] - [clatters] - [splashes] [upbeat music playing] Where are we going, Mom? We have to get away from here! Those people who bought the tickets will come. Run? But why? Don't be stupid. Once they know they've won, they'll come to us for the tickets. We don't have those. [music continues] Can't we just explain what happened? Fine, you do it if you want to, but I'm leaving now. Ooh. [intense sound effects] [Tay] Remember what I said in the opening scene? This guy right here, his name's Wen. [man] Action! [Tay] See, Wen's birth name was Prachuab, but he changed it to Jessadaporn, just like his acting idol. Wen dream is to be a famous actor, but the... best role he's ever landed so far is... [gun shots] [groaning] [Tay] Then came the big day when he got to play the leading man's friend, and he was given two lines to say. "From here to the city of New Delhi, not a soul has never heard of me." [evil laughter] "I became a thug when your dad was still sucking milk." [evil laughter] [in annoying voice] "From here to the city of New Delhi, not a soul has never heard of me." [clears throat] "From here to the city of New Delhi, not a soul has never heard of me." - "I became a thug when your dad..." - [woman] Wen! The director will change your lines. Okay. Sure. [gun shots] - [high-pitched moan] - [man] Cut! Good. Moving on! [woman] Done! Clear the set! [woman 2] Not for you. Hey, but Toi, why are you doing this to me? I must've bought tickets from you, like, a hundred times. You've earned a lot of money from me. And now that I've won, you're trying to fool me? [Tay] His nam e is Khung. People say he looks like the Olympian boxer Somjit Jongjohor. Except for the hair, the giant mole on his face, - and the boxing skills. - [boxing bell dings] NEW STAR, POBCHOKE [Tay] Actually, Khung's really not that old, but he started boxing when he was 12, so at 32, his face had aged way beyond hi s years. He won two boxing fights in a row and lost every match since. He never tasted victory again. Khung has been dreaming of winning for a third time. But that dream seems to keep running far away from him. Hey, hey! Wait up! Hey! Stop the bus! I said stop! Using just one tablet, our truly amazing Drain Attacker will surely be able to completely unclog your toilet here. And it'll be as good as new, allowing you once more to just happily take a nice big dump. [Tay] Now Khung tells everyone he meets that he works in an office that specializes in improving cash flow. And now we wait. [gurgling] Mmm! [chuckles] Don't worry about a thing. This is all just standard operating procedure. Oh, now, y'see? [laughs] This is gonna be good. - [bubbling loudly] - What? [whimpering] [bubbling stops] What? [suspenseful music playing] Ah... [loud explosion] [classical music playing] BREAKING NEWS [reporter] Allow me to give you a vivid description. His face was hit by a shitload of shit. They said some of them have gone into his lungs. Oh, my gosh, he could die from a serious case of blood infection. [gagging] I'm not lying to you. The mafia have taken my lottery tray. Well, you're just gonna have to get it back! [Tay] This woman talking is Zoe. [on microphone] Good afternoon, dear customers. Today, we are going to have the grand reveal of our premium, top-of-the-line model. Our fermented fish sauce... Whoo! Let me be honest with you. It's so delicious and hot that you'll forget your hot husband. Amazing Bra that's really so amazing. It lifts your boobs, making them bubbly and bouncy just like this. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. ding. Just like that. [Tay] Zoe said she can sell anything and everything, from toothpicks to submarines. - The only thing she's not selling is... - [overlapping patter] - [horn honk sound] - Oh fuck. - Ooh. - [sighs] [chuckles] Are you the bonus that comes with the car? If you say yes, I'll gladly buy it right now. Someone help! Help me. please! - This pervert just grabbed my butt! - Hey. - Whoa! Take it easy. - Someone help! Take it easy, my ass. Did you go easy when you grabbed my butt? No! You grabbed me hard and you nearly tore my panties off. - Why is this bitch throwing a tantrum? - Where are you going? - Stop right there! - This crazy woman's lost it. We haven't settled this matter! Hold up. Where are you going? - Look, I barely touched you. - Barely, my ass! Come back here. Zoe's parents left her and her brother, Seven, with their grandmother. When her grandmother died, Zoe became both sister and mother to her brother. The little ball is blue. Oh. What other colors did you learn about today? Pink! Pink. [Tay] Zoe's big dream is to go to Korea to get a boob job. She believes big boobs will help her get more jobs and earn more money, so she can care for her brother better. What? So what if it's hard? You have to find a way to get the lottery ticket back because it's mine and I paid for it. - And mine as well. It's six million baht. - Mm. How 'bout this? Why don't we just go to them and let's all demand that they return our lottery tickets to us? Yeah, that's good. But if they realize that those are jackpot winning tickets, - you really think they'd give them back? - Oh, you're right. We go to the cops and we let the cops handle them. Uh! Right! You're right. What's with you? You keep on saying that. Just shut the hell up if you don't have nothing better to say. - We go to the cops. - Uh-huh. - But... - There are no buts, ma'am. This is a matter of life and death. It could be dangerous. - I'll report it myself. - Mm. THE PEOPLE'S POLICE STATION Let us through. Excuse me. Hey, what happened here? [indistinct police radio chatter] This guy Jued is a soccer gambling addict. He placed his bets with an underground bookie. They cheated, so he got frustrated and angry and reported them to the police. The police raided the bookie after that. Oh, they sure ran for their lives. So, have the police caught the culprits? Look, the police officer died first. [gets shot, crying in pain] - [gun shot] - [groans] Holy shit! Are you serious? Oh crap. If getting the lotteries back means we'll have to risk our lives, then I'll pass. Hey, what if we go their place, sneak in, and steal the lotteries back without them even suspecting anything? That could work! - No, it can't. - Huh? Mr. Chye's factory is under 24-hour surveillance. Every single night, the gate is tightly secured. There are security cameras at every corner. But something is scarier than the cameras and the guards. And that's the... The lady who sells grilled chicken once told me that two druggie burglars climbed over the factory's fence and tried to steal things during the New Year holiday last year. You know what happened to them? [dramatic thump] They were electrocuted and died right there on the wall. - [electricity sparking] - [dogs howling] [swallows loudly, exhales] We're done, so let's go. It's fucking scary here. Look, I don't care. You'll have to sort this out yourselves. You have one day. I'm coming back tomorrow. [Tay] Her name is Beat. I have never met her before, but there is a sadness within her eyes that captivates me. [romantic piano music playing] [lizards chittering] [clock ticking] [Tay] I spent the whole night thinking about what I should do. [dramatic music playing] [gasps] Suddenly, something popped into my mind. It sounded so ridiculous, but I had nothing to lose, so I gave it a try. [rooster crows] Oh come on. I mean, you're Chief Chang, aren't you? Yeah. Well, you can't win all the time. [Tay] I've heard of Mr. Chye. Yup. [Tay] Still, I gathered as much information on him as possible. It sounded so ridiculous. The guard won't let you through the gate easily, unless you work in the factory. Besides the workers, only those with fighting cocks can get in. [man] Only boxing gamblers can get in. Anyone else don't stand a chance. That's just how it's always been. How much fish do you want? But me, I go in there often. Really? How come you can? [woman] That's 'cause I deliver food. It's for all those boxing gamblers. They earn a lot. They exchange millions there every night. Hey, you're serious? You've seen it with your own eyes? Yeah, of course I have. - [crowd cheering] - Three thousand, okay? [woman] Small-time gamblers place bets, but just downstairs. But then the big spenders do that upstairs. - How much, ma'am? - It's 40 baht. - Wait here. - Sure. [Chye] Okay, it's 1.5 million for boxing bids. [woman] There's cash, there's gold, and other valuables that are kept in that office. Doe, take it. Yes, sir. Hey, why are you here? Who, me? Just hanging. Put this in the safe. - Hey, can you lend me cash? Forty baht. - What? Again? - You're always broke. - [chuckles] Here's your money. Okay, thank you, sir. [woman] So why are you asking anyway? You don't look like a boxing gambler to me. Oh. Where'd he go? I forgot this. Oops. [chuckles] What's with him? [Tay] Once I'd gathered enough intel, I put them together to come up with a plan. KHUNG, WEN ZOE, BEAT KHUNG, WEN, TAY, BEAT, ZOE Are you absolutely sure that your plan is gonna work? I'm not. Huh? - Then what's the point? - [Wen] Mm. Well, it's for our lotteries, for six million baht for each of us, and for every single one of our dreams to come true. [laughing] [laughing] [laughs] What, are you nuts? Do you think you're Tom Cruise? Listen, that movie Mission: Impossible is from Hollywood, you understand? But this is real life. Huh? Here in Si Phraya, it's real life. - Right, Beat? - I'll do it. You see? Beat is agreeing to your plan. - Wait. Come again? - Hm? I'll do it. I'll go with your plan. [clock ticking] Well, we can't ask the mafia to give it back. And we can't tell the cops. We can't just sneak in there and rob them. So why don't we try this plan out? Even if it sounds ridiculous, stupid, and impossible, it's still better than sitting around and arguing like this. [monitor beeping] [sentimental pop song playing on earphones] [song continues] NEW STAR, POBCHOKE BUFFALO BRIDGE, WINS TWO MATCHES IN A ROW WATER FOR STARS WATER FOR EXTRAS [sighs] [groans softly] [sighs] [upbeat music playing] - [buzzing] - [yelps] [camera clicking] [man 2] There are no records, and there's no plate. That's okay, right? Yeah, it's perfect. But do you have one in gold? Say what? [upbeat music continues] [roaring] Hey! Mmm! - [sparking] - [shrieks] [shrieking] [Zoe] Where are you going? Let's remove your mole! [temple bell ringing] [sighs] Mm! What is this? A million baht in cash. What? - Only a hundred thousand is actually real. - Oh. The rest are counterfeit. Wen just borrowed them from the filming prop team. Where'd you get the 100,000 from? Khung borrowed it from the soccer gambling bookmaker. We'll use the mixed banknotes to deceive Mr. Chye. Cool, right? No, it's not. It's getting more and more outrageous. Your plan is not that easy to pull off. This isn't anything like a game of chess. It's very different. In chess, if you lose, you can start a new game. But this, if Mr. Chye and his men catch you, you're gonna end up dead! This plan of yours, it's just totally absurd. And what in this world is not absurd, Mom? That we're born poor? That you fell into a manhole? Or that Dad abandoned us? No matter how many more shrines you pray at, our lives are not gonna get any better. Our lives in this world is absurd, but if we're to keep living in this absurd world, we should have six million baht in our pockets. [engine roaring] [brakes screech] This is our plan, and it's going to begin with... SECRETARY ...Zoe, she'll play a sexy secretary. Oh? How sexy are we talking? Make it the sexiest role that you have ever done. [sexy pop music playing] [woman moaning] [moaning] [moaning] [gulps] [woman sighs] [Zoe] If I'm secretary, who's gonna be my boss? PROVINCIAL COUNCILOR BOSS [Tay] We are gonna use Wen's acting skills to lure the big fish into our trap. We're here to see Mr. Chye. [Mee] He's upstairs. [rooster clucking] Hey, be quiet. Saengchai. [clucking] [stops clucking] I'm in a meeting. Pleased to meet you, I'm PC Boss. I see. All right, Mr. PC. I dropped by because, I want some fireworks for my wife's big birthday. [Tay] PC Boss is some kind of big shot. - What kind of fireworks? - Hey! Hey. Hey! I only get the biggest baddest ones! I spare no expense. The biggest I have available, sir, cost over a million. He is hot-tempered. Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't you dare look down on me! I don't care how much it'll cost. He's also a drama king. [sobbing theatrically] My wife really loves fireworks. She's dying of terminal cancer. [sobbing] [wails] My dear wife... At first, it took one of her boobies. [both sniffle] A few years later, it took the other one from her. Both boobies are gone! Can you even imagine how lonely my hands have been? How lonely my hands have been. Oh, my poor wife. [sobbing] [gulps] [sobs] But you have to keep getting angry. Fuck you, cancer! Why couldn't you just take my boobs instead? I'll give you my balls as a bonus, you asshole! Then you're sad again. [sobbing] Why didn't you take me instead? Why didn't you take me instead? Why didn't you take my boobs? Why? Then you're aggressive! - Son of a bitch! - [startled gasp] You can hurt my wife all you want, but you can't hurt me! - And then you're sad. - [sobbing] And then you're aggressive. - Fuck you, cancer! - And then you're sad. But why? - You're aggressive! - So what, am I bipolar now? You taking a piss at me or something? Okay, yeah. I have an idea how to play him. I'll go as a smooth assassin. Calm, but ruthless deep down. And he's good-looking. [Tay] Okay, yeah. I heard you host ruleless boxing matches. And the big bets are placed every Friday night. Is that right? I think you must have... gotten your information wrong, sir. This factory is for fireworks. I sell fireworks. [chuckles] Before you feed me with more lies, allow me to show you the boxer who fights for me. [boxing bell dings] [intense music playing] Somjit Jongjorhor. Who the hell would fall for that? Only idiots, that's who. [intense music continues] You have an interesting fighter. Okay then. I'm gonna match my fighter against yours. We'll see you again on Friday. You'll get fireworks for your ailing wife, and you get to place all the bets you want. [upbeat music playing] Deal. Oh damn, they are the idiots. [chuckles] [soft acoustic pop music playing] Ta-da! I brought your uniform. Oh, I see. Let me close up. Okay. You want ice cream? Mm-hm. Let's go. [song continues] Do you need any help? It's okay. I'm done. - [clucking] - Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Hey, what are you looking at? I just realized that lottery results were announced two days ago. It's possible that there's a winning ticket somewhere in that tray. Why don't we check it out? [startled grunt] If you're done putting away the cocks and stuff, you can leave. Let's go. Go. [man] I don't get it. Why do you seem so scared of Sek? He's younger than us and he looks like a wimp. Come here. Mmm. It's 'cause you're new here, and you don't know what you're talking about. Mr. Chye assigns different jobs to us, right? Take for example, we look after the factory, collect debts, and take boxing bets. But as for Sek, when he's not fixing the boss' car, he's assigned to handle a special job. And what's that? - [gun cocks] - This. Bang! Bang! You're serious? You know the room full of concrete slabs where he fixes the cars? They say that beneath those slabs are Sek's "special jobs." Fuck, man! That's scary! Huh? Oh fuck, when did he get here? [gentle piano music playing] It's amazing. Ten-baht ice cream with a million-baht view. Sometimes I tend to wonder who lives on the top floor of those buildings. But certainly, it's not someone we know nor someone we've met. [sighs heavily] I'm curious though, how those type of people spend their days. Do they ever... go through a miserable, terrible, and shitty life like we do daily? One of those who live there might be the person who had made my dad... the way he is. [Tay] My mom told me about your dad. I'm so sorry. - [man 3] Hey, what happened? - [man 4] There was this sports car. It ran over the locksmith at his stall. That's so messed up. Did the locksmith survive? - I hope they caught the culprit. - Yeah. [Beat] When I saw how my dad was at the hospital, it was painful. [exhales] But it was more painful to see that bastard laugh. [men laughing] Thanks for settling this matter for me. [Beat] I thought about getting back at him. [lawyer] Relay our gratitude to your dad, Mr. Great. - [Beat] I wanted him to feel pain, - [zapping] just like I did. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Have you all eaten [Beat] But I could never lay a finger on him. And ever since my dad's been in the hospital, he never went to visit him. He never talked or even apologized to me. And you know what? He maybe has no idea what... the guy he hit and his daughter even look like. I hope the six million baht will be enough for me to hire a good lawyer and send that rich asshole behind bars. But I'm also aware that... that no matter how much I spend on a lawyer, that son of a bitch will outspend me for an even better lawyer. Or no matter how much money I have, my dad probably won't wake up. But... at least it's good to give it a try, am I right? [whistling jaunty melody] - What are you doing? - [continues] Whenever I'm feeling sad, I always whistle this tune. And, what about when you feel happy? [whistling "Auld Lang Syne"] [both whistling "Auld Lang Syne"] [both laughing] [both sigh] Beat, let's go get our six million back. To the ridiculous and improbable plan. [chuckles] To our ridiculous and improbable plan. [both laugh] [Tay sighs] ["Auld Lang Syne" palying on guitar] - [bell ringing] - [metal door opening] [bell stops ringing] [breathing nervously] I think that... we should call the whole thing off and run. It's too late. Hello there, everyone. Wow, I'm really liking your style, PC Boss. I'm very impressed. You wanna have one of these loincloths? Your fighter will be... in the boxing ring in ten minutes. I hope you're all set. It's my first time here, I won't bet too high and scare you off. One million baht. If your fighter wins, it's yours. [suspenseful music playing] A million baht in cash. Only a hundred thousand is actually real. We'll use the mixed banknotes to deceive Mr. Chye. No need to count. I'm gonna take your word for it. If my fighter loses, you can have all the fireworks that you ordered for your wife for free. Aren't you going to give us the pleasure of seeing your boxer? [clapping] [gulps] - [Zoe] Hey Khung, where are you going? - Well, I'm running away, obviously. - Stop! Wait! Don't go. No. Stop! - Hey, just let me go! Stop it right there! What the hell's wrong with you, huh? How can you run away now? Oh, if I don't run now, then when? That guy's Iron Man, built like a tank! Who's that? Iron Man is the MMA champion, he's a pro. He TKO's TKO's TKO's all his opponents! The thing with Tay's plan is that it's pretty much a long shot. But one thing is certain, if I fight against that guy, I'll fucking die! You know what I think? Maybe he's just a fake Iron Man! Just like you are! A big Somjit pretender! [grunts] Aah! You're a genius. I forgot about that. Oh, this country is full of copies. A fake? You liar! Who else will fake it like us? The guy is the real Iron Man. Stop it right there, Khung! I thought you said you wanted another chance to prove yourself in the ring. And now you're going to run away like a coward? If you'll just run away now, you'll have to run away forever. Your chance is right here in front of you. You just have to do it! Try not to forget who you are. You're not here to be known as Khung the Loser. And you are not Pobchoke Sor Saphan Khwai. But you are Somjit! Somjit! Somjit! I am Somjit! You are Somjit! I am Somjit! Yes, you are Somjit! I am Somjit! You are Somjit Jongjorhor! I am Somjit Jongjohor! Yeah! You can go to hell. You can stop with the bullshit. You can't pep talk me into fighting him. [sighs] What if I brought something magical that can help you win this fight? [bell tolls] [whistling "Auld Lang Syne"] [bell ringing] [drums banging] [music stops] Oh. What the fuck are you doing? Every boxer needs a dramatic entrance before the fight. Felt more like a ceremony. - And you... - [gasps] Why you... [spits] Stop throwing those. They're in my ears and mouth. Son of a... [lights click on] How long are you gonna stand here? Go! [crowd muttering] [staccato string music playing] I certainly hope you're ready for this. [music continues] [roaring] The sacred lip balm that was blessed by Venerable Yam of Yamnok Temple is super rare. People will pay four million for this small tin. This is some amazing stuff. This balm has been blessed on the fifth using five earthly elements. It's the holiest balm since the Roman Empire. It makes you invincible. He could drop-kick you 50 times and you won't feel a thing. It was passed down from generation to generation. Just put it on. I guarantee its power. [coughs] So the rule is, there are no rules. It's a battle of freestyle fighting. If you're knocked down and can't get up, you lose, get it? [bell dings] I won't lose to you! You better just go home! Unless you wanna go home in tears! - Just fight already! - [whimpers] I'm sorry, sir. [rings] - Fight! - [groans] [crowd cheering] [grunting] [cheering] - [man 1] Look at that! - [man 2] Hit him on the nose. Hey! Come on, throw a punch! Concentrate! Come on, focus, man! - Move it, hit him on target! - [Iron Man grunts] Oh, yeah! Hey, you bitch! Get that sprinkle shit away from my face! [grunts] - Connect already! Connect! - Watch out! [crowd cheers] - Go for him, man! Go for him! - [grunts] [man in crowd] What the hell is this? Go! Again, again! [man in crowd] What are you doing? - Get him! - Get him. - Peekaboo! - [grunts] Oh, yeah! Boo! Hey! [cheering] [roars] [grunting] - Come on! - Hey. [grunting] Yeah! [Iron Man grunting] [Chye] What the hell? Come on. [grunts] - Well done! - Yeah! - [grunting] - [cage rattling] Oof! [man in crowd] What's wrong with you? [yells, groans] [yelling] - Yeah, come on! - Argh! The Ball-Grabbing Monkey Move! [grunting] [sound of glass shattering] Ooh... [screams] - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yes! - There! That's it! [laughs] Your punches are only child's play. Ooh! That magical lip balm is so amazing, isn't it? Magical, my ass. It's just a normal lip balm. What? Oh, please. I got it from a corner store. - [bones cracking] - Ah! [all] Ooh! Sorry. Time out, please. - Put more lip balm on me. - Do it. [man in crowd] There you go. [crowd cheering] - Oof! - Ooh! Isn't that bastard tired yet? [grunting] - Hey! Don't back down just yet. Go! - [cell phone ringing] Yeah! That's it! Hit him just like that! [crowd cheering] [Tay on phone] Hey Zoe, start the "Mee Capture Operation" now. Hey! Go get him! Yeah! Good move! Give him a left! Hit him some more! - Yeah! - Go! [crowd continues cheering] - [woman moaning] - [horse neighing] [cheering] [horse neighing] [tiger roaring] - [cat snarling] - [Chye] Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get him, quickly! Now! Come on! Now! Now! Now! [dance music playing] [moans] [moaning] [grunts, gulps] [trilling lips] Ah! [sighs] Don't you want to watch the fight? Not anymore. I want to watch something else. Mmm... Come on, babe. [moaning] - [horn honk sound] - [screaming] - [growls] - [grunts] [groans] [breathing heavily] Should've told me you like it rough. [whimpers] Because so do I. Slap me again? What? [crowd cheering faintly] - Again? - Yeah. Ah... Again. [grunts] - Again. - [groans] Again! - Again! - [yells] Enough. - Now it's my turn, babe. - What? [crowd cheering] [grunting] Come on! Hey! On your guard! Like that, yeah! There! Good, yeah! No, hit him on target! [panting] [heavy breathing and moaning] [moaning] - [Mee grunting] - [moaning] - [grunting] - [gasping] - [mouthing] Do you have the key? Where? - [Mee] Take this. And this. - That! - [moans] [Mee grunting] Now we're screwed. No! Why'd you stop what you're doing? We were just... getting into the groove. I'm so happy I met someone with the same taste as mine! - [grunting] - [moaning] - [light clicks] - [Mee] Huh? What the hell? - [punches landing] - [Mee yells] [dull thus] Ah! Shit! Shit! Shit. [gasps] Why did you hit me, idiot? Oh shit! [groans] It was dark. Oh, jeez! You're Toi's son, right? [tense music playing] What are you doing here, huh? Damn it. What now? You tried to hit me? Or could it be that you two... Oh shit, the lotteries. - [Tay] Shit! - [screams] [all] Ah! Ah! - [light clicks] - [grunting] Huh? Huh? - [light clicks] - [grunting] Ah! - [light clicks] - [grunting, yelling] [grunts] [groans] [crowd cheering] [grunting] This lip balm you gave me really is amazing. I don't feel anything right now. It's the best lip balm since the Roman Empire. Nice one! Time for Leg-Gnawing! Ah! - [crunching] - [crying in pain] [grunts] [gasps] [shallow, slow breathing] You suck! You can't be a boxer. You're a wimp! Go back to sell your stupid toilet cleaner! - [spits] - [laughing] [laughing] I'm not a toilet cleaner salesman anymore. I'm a boxer! You better believe it! Hmph! [yells, grunts] [punches landing] [punches continue landing] [grunting] Hey, that's the referee, dumbass! [grunts] Ah! What was that, a dream? Oh jeez, I shouldn't have woken up! - [panting] - What took you so long? It's a long story. Here. And now, we've finally come to the big play. TAY, BEAT [panting] We're screwed. Oh fuck. What is that thing? Are you an idiot? What we have here is a fingerprint lock. So what now? [grunting] Let's hope this works. [lock beeps] [continues beeping] - [clicks] - Yes! [rooster clucking] Huh? What's this? There's no key to unlock this thing. Seriously? Not this again? Beat. Now's the time to show off your locksmith skills. [breathing heavily] [suspenseful music playing] [sighs] Get him! [grunts angrily] [cheering] IS THE OLYMPIAN REALLY AT YOUR RING? TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LINK [woman] All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're finally back with our very special guest for today! Give it up for Somjit Jongjorhor! [groans] Assholes. [lock clicks open] - [Tay] Fuck! - [Beat] What's this? Where's the lottery tray? Hey, order some more drinks and prepare me a glass. [groans, hiccups] [chuckles] Here. His fingerprint. And the key to the cabinet. Don't forget my cut. [cash register dinging] Where the hell is it? - [Mee] Son of a bitch! - Hey, it's Mee! - [grunts] - [yells] - [grunts] - [groans] [groans] [men grunting] [grunts] That's it! - Look, boss. - What is that? [Somjit on video] Hey guys! Today, I've come to tell all of you about this wonderful product. This product is out of this world! Look at my hair. It's black and shiny and I look young as ever, I'm telling you. [woman] That's right. So, as you can all observe, our guest's hair thick and beautiful. [Somjit] I'm telling you, this product helped me out a lot. I can't recommend this product enough. [continues indistinctly] Yeah, block him! Hold him! Come on! Son of a bitch. [grunts] [Beat yells] - [groans] - [grunts] Ow! Argh! Oh! [grunts] Hey! Ow! [groans] [all groan] - [kick landing] - [groans] [grunts] - Ooh! - Yeah! Oof! - Ah! - [grunts] Hold him! Yeah, that's right! Yeah! That's it! Right! Good job! Yeah! That's right! Huh? You lied to me. What do you mean? The guy with the ugly lips is not Somjit. Hmm? Who told you that? That's Somjit. [grunts] Hey, Khung! Ah... His name's Khung. What about you? Are you really PC Boss? Huh? Will you tell me nicely or should I make you cry? [all yell] - [Zoe] Whoa! - Hey! What the hell? Hey, wait, stop! The lottery tray! The lottery tray! It's mine! - It's mine! - It's mine! [grunts] [grunting] - [rooster clucks] - [grunts] [Beat yells] - Ah! - [metallic clang] [clangs] Ow! [grunts] Hey! ["Auld Lang Syne" playing] - [Mee yelling] - [both gasp] Too bad, but your kicks are nothing for my pecs. I've worked really hard on them. [groans] [Beat sighs] You asshole! Who kicked me? I did! What the hell are you waiting for? Run! Leave me here, you fool! Go. Follow them! - [grunts] - [gasps] You jerk! You surprised me, I couldn't flex my face in time. [groans] Ah. [grunts] [grunting] There! [crying in pain] [gasps] It hurts. Exactly how I like it. [whimpers] I'm sorry. Stop right there! Protecting your woman is a thing, right? Take this. [grunts] [Beat] Stop! Oh shit. [panting] - Wait! - What? - What happened to my face? - That mirror's broken! [sobs] - Let go! - Let go! - Let go! - Let go! - It's mine! - It's mine! - It's mine, let go! - It's mine. [clucking] - You... - [grunting] This trick is too old for me. Goddammit! - And what about this? - [screams] [both groaning] Oh man, I got electrocuted. That's it. C'mon! - [pants] - Let's go. Come on. Come on. [trilling lips] Are you okay? Why didn't you use the taser earlier? I forgot. Hey. Are you all right? ["Auld Lang Syne" playing] Hey. Shall we leave? Mm. Let's go. Come on. Hey, where are you going? It's this way. Come on. - What? - Come on! Let's go, let's go! - It's mine! No, it's mine! - It's mine! Hey! What's that? [laughs] I won't fall for that? I'm not an idiot. - I won't... [groans] - [zapping] [continues groaning] What the hell are you... [groaning] Hey! - Stop... [vibrating] - [imitating mockingly] [panting] I'm begging you. Just let me pass out in peace, okay? [clucking] - Oh! Hey! - Oh, hey! Hey. You got it, right? - Shit! - [gasps] What the hell happened to your face? Leave that for now, take care of this first. Okay. FIVE TICKETS, 30 MILLION BAHT [gasping softly] Here it is, a set of five. Thirty million baht Six million for each of us! - Come on. - Let's go. Oh fuck. [intense music playing] What's the hurry, guys? I think you need to tell my boss first. Tell him who you are and what you're doing here. STUPID LEADER WILL LEAD US ASTRAY Why would you risk your lives for this lottery tray? Is it worth it? [suspenseful music playing] Or could it be that this tray's... [clicks tongue] Give me the tray. [suspenseful music continues] [rooster clucking] [continues clucking] [rooster crows] Give me the tray! Now's the time, right? I guess. Our plan could fall apart for many different reasons, so we need to make a plan B just in case. Give it to me! [clock ticking] Give it now! [suspenseful music builds] [choir chanting dramatically] [music stops] [groans] [gasps] That was some throw! None of you fools are getting out of here alive, you hear? [sparking] [sniffs] Ugh. [loud explosion] ["Hallelujah Chorus" by Handel playing] [music fades] [rubble clattering] [whimpering] [shouts] [explosions continue faintly] PARKING BEHIND THE SHRINE [menacing music playing] [panting] Oh shit, look. What do we do now? Looks like our car is blocked. How about we take that? What are you talking about? I can't see a thing! - Jeez. I feel bad for him. - Let's go. What... Ah! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Close the doors, close the doors. [all panting] Uh, hey, Tay, so how do you know if this car has a key? - You're right! - [Beat] Oh, no! [keys rattle] - Here. - What? - [engine revs] - [screaming] [groaning] Hey! [Khung] Oh shit! The guard and the gate. What do we do now? Just run into them! Sure. I've always wanted to do a scene like this. - [tires squeal] - [all scream] [guard] Ooh, ohh, ah! [grunts] [all moaning in pain] Fuck me. This isn't like in the movies. [Zoe groans] For fuck's sake! [Khung moans] It didn't work, the gate's still there! At this rate, they're going to kill us! They won't. They're going to torture us first. Shut it! [metal creaking] [all gasping] Hey. Step on it! What are you waiting for? Okay! - [shouting] - [all yelling] [fireworks exploding] ["Auld Lang Syne" playing on electric guitar] [Tay] Come on, get out, get out! [sighs] [music fades] [all sighing] Oh, God. We actually made it. [exhales] [sighs] [fireworks exploding] [romantic version of "Auld Lang Syne" playing] [fireworks continue] [bells chiming] [gun shot] [dull thud] Oh, Doe... You bit the hands that feed you. You got me into trouble, stabbed me in the back by stealing my things. Have mercy, boss. Please don't kill me. I have to take care of my grandma. How will she survive if I die? I won't kill you. At least, you brought me the jackpot. [sighing in relief] - Give me the tray! - [all gasp] [suspenseful music builds] [fireworks continue] - Mee. - What is it, boss? I guess your grandma will have to live alone. [Mee grunts] [Wen groans] - Hey! - Huh? Wen! - Wen! - Hey, Wen. - Hey. - Wen. Wen, what's wrong? Wen. Wait. Did you get shot? No. Wen, let me look at the wound! - Easy, easy. - Hey, you don't have to worry, Wen. We'll take you to the hospital right away. - [Tay] Let me see. - [Zoe] Hang in there, Wen! [weakly] You know what? This is the first time that I feel so proud of being shot by a gun. [sad music playing] There's no camera to record it, And yet I... I feel so worthy of it. [exhales] Beat. Yes? [groans] I give you my share. Use it for your dad. I won't take it, no. Hey, don't say that. Why does everything feel so cold? Hey, Wen. It's so dark... Cut it out, Wen... So sleepy... - Hey, Wen! - Hmm? What are you babbling about? You didn't get shot. [music stops] [Wen] What? Look, there's no wound, you didn't get shot. - Right. - What? I didn't get shot? - [all] No! - Ugh! What the fuck is wrong with you? Yeah, what's wrong with me? Ugh! Oh, I get it. The loincloth was so tight, I almost fainted. - [all groan] - Oh goodness. - Also, Beat. - Yes? I told you I'd give you my money, sorry, I take it back. [laughs] [laughs] [laughing] [Tay] Oh, God. And then the last thing we have to do is get our stuff and pack our bags because we have to go our separate ways. We have to run as far as we possibly can. Let's hope that we'll be safe and sound in the end, and get to spend our winning money. [panting] Hey. I really hate saying goodbyes. Everyone, you guys stay safe, all right? And you have to keep me updated on where you are. You got that? Mmm. - Khung. - Hmm? Listen, I may have disrespected you in the past, but I want to tell you that... I won't apologize to you. Yeah? Screw you. Why did you bring it up? Huh? I may love drama, but I hate to be overdramatic, it's not cool. [snickers] [Toi] Tay. - [gun cocks] - [Toi whimpers] Mom! Sek, I think you're gonna need more cement this time. Because it won't be just two bodies, it'll be eight. Give me the tickets. Let my mom go first. Do you think you can negotiate? You can dream on, buddy. - Hand it over! - [sobs] [Toi] Tay. [tense music playing] I'm so sorry, guys. [music continues] - [grunts] - [Toi screams] - Tay, be careful! - Be careful! [grunting] [all yelling] Wait, wait, no, no. [all yelling] Hey. [grunting] [all grunting] [Zoe] Press it down! [all shouting] - [gun shot] - [Zoe] Shit! [all gasp] Huh? [Khung] Oh, it's still here. [Tay] I told already you that one of us might not get out of this alive. Now, can you take a guess who it is? [exhales shakily] [sparse, tense music playing] Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! No, no, no! [Toi gasping] - Mom! - Mrs. Toi... [Tay sobbing] No, please, Mom. - Please, Mom. - Tay... No, Mom. Please. Please, just hang in there, Mom. - [jagged breathing] - Just hang in there, Mom. Mom... [sobbing] [gun cocks] [intense music builds] [gun shots] - Mom... - [Toi] Tay, my dear. [gun clatters] [Tay] Don't forget that we're just ordinary people. It's possible that Plan B could also fall out, so we also need Plan C to back us up. Someone who can be as ruthless as they are. SOCCER GAMBLING BOOKMAKER [Zoe whimpers] Hey! Mrs. Toi! - Mrs. Toi. - Mrs. Toi. Mom... [chuckles] Well, that was pretty close, huh? I'll take this as a payment for your hundred thousand baht loan. And the remaining amount is gonna be for saving each one of your sorry asses. Understand? [sirens wailing] [sobbing softly] [exhales] Uh, Mom... Mom, don't do that. Don't take it off. [Toi groans] Hang in there, Mom. We'll be at a hospital soon. The doctor will take care of you. You'll be all right, you'll see. [sighs] Mom... [sighs deeply] Tay... Stop it, Mom. Don't say anything. Later, we can talk about it, okay? We'll talk when you get better. [Toi exhales] Do you know... what it was that I asked the gods for when I prayed to them? I didn't ask for anything. All I did was thank the gods. I thanked them for letting you be born as my son. [chuckles] [melancholy "Auld Lang Syne" playing] [Toi] Y ou often said that there's nothing valuable in our house. You're wrong, my dear. It's you. You are the most valuable thing in my life. [sobbing] We don't have to be any richer. And we don't really need more luck. [inhales] Just having you, son... is good enough for me. [sobs] [both sobbing] [Beat] What about you? What do you want to do with the six million? It's simple. I'll buy a new house for my mom. I'm going to buy a more beautiful and comfortable house for her. I don't want her to break her back from sewing or wandering around hawking lotteries. Mm. Why are you smiling? Well, I was thinking what a good son you are. [laughing] Nah. I think that's too much. But I think you understand what I'm talking about. The equation of life is quite simple. How so? "Someone we love being happy" equals "us being happy." It's that simple. Mm. [sighs] You're right. [melancholy piano music playing] How is she, doc? [doctor] She's gonna make it. [Zoe] She's okay now? [screams] Thank you, sir. Come on, come on. - You're asking for it! - She's safe now! She's okay. I've had tougher things than that. Come at me! [grunting] Hey. Stop that. Oh, uh... Sorry. Tay's mom is safe now. [boat horn honks] [Tay] Mom barely survived. She had to spend a month in the hospital. And since it was a fatal gunfight, the police came to investigate us. We told them everything that happened, including our absurd plan to steal the lotteries back. Mr. Chye's firework factory was ordered to shut down. He managed to run away and the police have yet to capture him. But what the police and others didn't know is that the five lotteries were not lost during the shoot-out. They're with the soccer gambling bookies. But we keep this a secret and don't bother to try to get them back. After being held at gunpoint that night, it seemed that we realized six million wasn't really worth risking our lives for, even though we still have the same shitty lives. [sighs] I get it, but I can't help but feel sad about the money. Oh, my new boobs, man. Hey wait! We should hatch a plan to steal the lotteries again! - [tsks] Hey! - [sighs] What? Why not? Once is enough for this stupid plan. It's too outrageous to pull off again. Maybe we could sell that truck and then split the money. You've got nerve, Tay. I mean, look at that piece of junk. If we sell it, how will we make? Yeah. That's true. But one bird in hand is worth two in the bush. That's also true. [toilet flushing sound] What the...? What is it, Khung? Hey, it's the fighting cock from the office. Don't tell me that we'll get to have boiled chicken with fish sauce to celebrate our sad and miserable lives? Hold on. 4-MILLION BAHT CHAMP [Khung] Holy shit! What is it? What's the matter? I hope it's true. THE HOTTEST FIGHTING COCK OF THE YEAR RED DRAGON, WORTH THREE MILLION Holy crap! Besides the "holy shit" and "holy crap", I understood nothing. Just spill it. I knew it. That's why the necklace looked familiar to me. Don't tell me. It's made of real diamonds, isn't it? I'm not talking about the necklace. I'm talking about the cock. Huh? Look! What? SAENGCHAI, WORTH EIGHT MILLION BAHT! [all] Oh fuck! ♪ Run for da money, run for da money ♪ [all] We're rich! [Tay] It turns out that a fighting cock is worth a lot of money for having won so many matches. But most importantly, this very fighting cock is worth eight million. ♪ Run for it, run for it, run for it ♪ [cash register dings] [inspirational music playing] [Tay] Khung sold the cock to the soccer gambling bookies. Then we all split the money and began to pursue our dreams. Khung opened his own boxing gym in his hometown. After the fight with Iron Man, his demon was then completely exorcised. Nowadays, he devotes himself - to other boxers' dreams. - [all cheering] [Wen] I'm telling you, anyone would get excited in that kind of situation. He was a real gang boss, and I was a fake senator. Ooh. [Tay] Wen got rich and famous, as he always wanted to be. He's surrounded by many people. I've received many offers, four movies and eight series. [excited gasps] I don't know when I'll get to sleep. Anyway, please watch my film, The Lizard Hunter. What's your role in the film, Mr. Wen? Take a guess. Is it the lizard? - Are you serious? - Really? - Is that true? - Hey, he's acting as the lizard. [Tay] Zoe changed her mind about the boob job and used the money to send her brother to a good school. Now onstage to press the button for this event, please welcome the Prime Minister! [anthem playing] - Oof. - Sir, you okay? [groans] [Tay] Though her boobs aren't big, Zoe is still Zoe. She gets hired to promote major products anyway. [dings] [fanfare playing] Everyone give it up for Thailand's new submarine! [Tay] When she said that she could sell everything from toothpicks to submarines, well, it finally became a reality. LOTTERY, 2 MAY 2023 [Tay] Now what about me and my mom? Hope you get rich. [Tay] We went back to Nong Khai... That one? Good choice. ...to expand our once-every-16-days dream business. [Toi laughing] And Mom won't have to risk falling into manholes. [woman on TV] What's the update on Mr. Great's hit-and-run case? The court has kindly acquitted Mr. Great of all charges. It has been ruled that he was only guilty of reckless driving, with a suspended sentence. The case is now closed. [Tay] I check in on Beat from time to time. She used the money to hire a lawyer to fight her father's case. But just like she told me when we talked on the rooftop, the rich asshole outspent her and managed to hire a better lawyer. In the end, he was cleared of all charges. [monitor beeping] [Tay] Beat's father passed away a few months after the case was closed. It's... an extremely cruel reality. I feel so sorry for her. [metal grinding] Please wait and we'll get to you. Wow. You raise the fish better than I do. He's much bigger than mine. What are you doing here? Well, I'm not for keys. If I invite you to do something else, would you come with me? [man] Join me. We have plenty of drugs and chicks. What else do you want? [snorting] What are you afraid of? I got cleared of all charges. [snorts] Okay. See you. Mr. Great. [Beat] Getting too comfortable? [chuckles] So this is the view from the top. It's amazing!
