(cars honking) - [Voiceover] A keystone species is any species in an ecosystem whose population and behavior affects every other species. That's certainly what we are as a species right now. - [Voiceover] If you look at the foundation out of current system, it's based on a flawed understanding of nature, and a lot of our political ideologies, our economic system, it's all based on this understanding that we're separate from natural systems. - [Voiceover] We've seen enough examples in different civilizations and societies that have existed throughout history. Invariably you'll find that the reason why they no longer exist is because they undermine their resource base. - [Voiceover] The word agriculture comes from Agrarian culture. Agrarian means the soil, culture means the enrichment of it. Agriculture today is the destruction and depletion and extraction of soil. It's an extractive process closer to mining. - [Voiceover] All of the agricultural soils where our food is coming from is losing around two millimeters topsoil per acre per year every single year. It really can't continue. - [Voiceover] So as we look at the present modern world that we live in, it's largely an industrial economy. And this idea of centralization, mass production, long distance transportation, goes completely against how it is that evolution has actually done what it's done so beautifully and ingeniously on the Earth. And what we're looking towards is this question of adaptation. How can we, as a species, really adapt to how the Earth works? - [Voiceover] In order for us to design an agriculture or a culture that is ecological, then we have to look to our local models, and that's the forest. That is our teacher. - An ecosystem generally doesn't require lots of energy input from the outside from another ecosystem. It's finding a way to work with the sun and all the natural cycles throughout the seasons to produce what it needs. - [Voiceover] Nature's the best thing we got. Point to something else that's better. There's nothing, we don't have anything else. And it hasn't only survived, it's thrived, it's found ways to adapt to new conditions. - [Voiceover] Let's now design ecosystems. They're ecologically sound, economically productive, and permanent agriculture. - [Voiceover] Permaculture is not a thing. It's a way of thinking, it's a process of design. And the word permaculture comes from permanent and agriculture, and it's putting those two things together and asking the question can we create a permanent agriculture. Not permanent in the sense of concrete, but permanent in the sense that it is built upon and grounded in the resilient diversity of how ecosystems work. And it's also a permanent culture in the sense that can culture become something that is grounded in the real resilience of biology. - And we can really look at permaculture design as a whole way of seeing the world. Looking at problems and seeing how they can turn into solutions. - [Voiceover] Permaculture is a design process that's applicable n any landscape for any set of objectives. - Permaculture is dependent on the prospects for us doing good, not us just doing less bad. And that really has been the driver of a lot of the modern environmental movement is people doing less bad, let's just do less damage. Be eco, lower our footprint. - [Voiceover] And concepts like this create a very dangerous self image because it's a self image that's based on the notion that we're inherently bad, or inherently a scourge on the face of the planet. - [Voiceover] I wanna have as small an impact as possible. Ultimately, it'd be better if you didn't live with that approach, right? And that's where you go with that philosophy. Well I don't wanna be dead, I wanna live, and I want the lives around me to live better as well because I had lived. So all of a sudden humans start doing good and then impact is a great thing. Footprint is something we wanna leave. - [Ben] We're a piece of land that's representative of what most of land is in the United States and increasing in the world, it's a beat up old hill farm, so it's degraded land, we're not on agricultural land, so the strategies we're working with are specifically to respond to these conditions, how to restore health to degraded land and to do so in a way in which you're gleaning valuable yields. We see the time we're in today as a period where we need new tools and new strategies, new techniques for land repair that are adaptive in our more rapidly changing world. Whoa! We check them once every few days to a week. Look at their hooves, make sure they're healthy. It wasn't until after we got sheep that I realized that the site, that the biomass, the biological material, that the site was producing was mostly oxidizing, it wasn't being cycled back into soil directly, and that doesn't really build soil very quickly, this material falls down and it decays in the sunlight and oxidizes and it doesn't turn into soil directly. And when this material goes in the mouth of a grazing animal and out through the backside it comes out as fantastic, pure soil and moves right back into the soil food web system. All of a sudden, when we got grazing animals, the lushness of the site and the vitality of it just started to go straight up and we saw more richness in what the soil could do on this site in a season of grazing than we had in six years before. So we're always adding organic matter, feeding the soil from the top and also feeding from the bottom with roots because that's carbon that was in the atmosphere, these roots... Now in the soil, that's carbon going from the atmosphere into the soil, that's the reverse of a smokestack. That's the opposite of a factory. And plants are the opposite of a factory, right, reverse carbon conveyor belt. Oh, I'm stepping on them, there' s so many! Wow! It's neat to see the value of perennials in the ecosystem as far as food producers, you know, perennials, plants that don't have to be planted every year, they're constantly growing, constantly establishing themselves deep in the root systems growing bigger every year and more productive every year versus an annual that we always have to plant. Seaberry is a nutraceutical quality berry that's loaded with essential fatty acids and vitamin E, vitamine C, many forms of anti-cancer compounds. It's really a citrus of the North, but it's much more nutrient dense than any citrus, and it's a nitrogen fixing fruit, one of the only that we can grow, so it's actually putting more nitrogen into the soil than it takes, it's putting more fertility back into the soil than it extracts while giving us a very high quality yield of food and medicine. The plants that are most medicinal for the land also tend to be the most medicinal for the human body. Which probably isn't a coincidence, we're all co-evolved with plants for tens and hundreds of thousands of years. So here we are in seaberry swale zone and this is our growing medium here. If you look at the material we're on, you just pull back the one inch of subsoil... And roots, you see what we're on here. This is bedrock, we're on zero to one to 12 inches of subsoil on the Earth itself, the mantle, right, schist, green mountain bedrock Terrible land, the opposite of Ag land and we've turned what was the least productive area this property into now the most productive, this Southwest facing slope was in perpetual drought and I didn't realize that until we actually dug these swales. Swales is where you cut out of a slope on a line of equal elevation across a slope, not up and down, horizontally across the slope, you take that material and you put it downhill. (beeping) And so all you do is create this long channel where the water has to stop when it's flowing downhill, and it's spread out and infiltrate. And so all of a sudden the water has to go into the soil and it's not just moving across the surface, it's going into the soil horizon and then percolating through the soil past the roots of plants. Made the swale. Does anywhere in this whole field look as productive as this? There's so much more food and soil building here, this is the kind of biological action that's happening here. So I got tillage radish, purple top turnips, clover, there's so much food for people and animals here. There's more food for grazing animals on this swale than there is in the existing field that was here and probably more nutrition here than there is in this entire field. And we didn't add anything, we just changed the structure. The only input's in running the machine, we didn't put lime or fertilizer or anything like that in. It's structural adjustments, land Rolfing Land chiropractics, it's like... The rice comes right out of its stalk, so all of these, that's really cool, you see how it's inside that? The rice? It's coming out of... The grass. In parts of Southeast Asia they've managed to figure out how to grow grain for not just hundreds, but thousands of years in the same piece of land in these things called patties, even on hilly landscapes without losing their soil, without losing the constant battle to erosion and gravity which is soil loss and nutrient loss. Because the patty changes everything. All of a sudden you have a depression in the landscape, and you have a system that's catching everything rather than always losing your nutrients. Everything we're doing here, we're realizing, is an attempt to actually farm the water first and the soil second. Now water droplets that used to have to travel about 1,500 feet from the top of the property to the bottom have to travel about a mile through swales and patties and ponds and most of that water never even leaves the site, it's infiltrated and recharges the ground water, or it goes right into plants and evaporated back up into the hydrological system to fall as rain somewhere else. There's a fossil fuel input there to create these land shapes which I resisted early on and wanted to do everything by hand, but then I realized this energy is only gonna be cheap and super available potentially for a short window in human history, we have those resources today, and they're being burned up for flagrant uses every day. So now my approach is one of oil intervention, oil to soil, oil to inter-generational infrastructure. We get done with Earth working an area of the land, heavy equipment never goes back there, it's done, that land is structurally adjusted to be more robust for the next five, 10,000 years until the ice comes back again. And be more resilient in the face of drought or flood and more productive every year thereafter with a little bit of Earth shaping. We're not just creating rows of corn or beans, that's just for us, you think about cultivated till field, that's just for human beings, everything else needs to basically be killed to get that crop, you know, that thousand acre cornfield. Well creating a multi-storied ecosystem with mushrooms and berries and fruits and nuts and grazing animals and vegetables all interwoven, this idea of permaculture. - [Eric] Among the things that do well in this spot... (mumble) eat as many as you can put in your mouth at once. We found a place that was just as beat up as it could possibly be, the house was brand new but the yard was just a wreck, most of it was fill, it didn't even have vegetation on it or anything. We could have gotten a farm and stuff, but we wanted to show what could be done on this scale 'cause so many people have yards this side and we wanted to show that even with terrible soil and lots of shade you can produce a huge amount of food. We spent a year learning the site Watching it in every season, learning the pattern of light and shadow and rainfall and snow and wind and came up with a pattern that harmonizes to the best of our ability our goals within needs and opportunities the site presents. Basically we wanted a double handful of fruit every day from late May through November. We wanted edible greens every day of the year. We wanted to build organic matter and to put some vegetation in here and to make some habitat to bring life back, to bring animal life and soil life and fungal life back to the site. And we're trying to do it in a way that functions as a real ecosystem. We've tried to find this garden as the best of both worlds where you've got native plants and habitat plants, many of which are edible. And you've got food plants many of which provide habitat all working together to try and bring this ecosystem, this novel designed ecosystem to life. And it's mostly perennial. We're experimenting with perennial beans and perennial chickpeas and all kinds of stuff. So we grow 70 kinds of perennial greens and another 46 species of fruit. These are paw paws, and it's a delicious fruit, it's related to cherimoya, soursop and guanabana all that good stuff, and it's native here which is really important to us, we feel like we always wanna start looking at the native plants of our area and building out. Paw paws are creamy and custardy and wonderful. I'm not a spiritual guy, but I would say there's a spiritual enrichment that happens when you make that transformation, when you regenerate a site and that's why we talk about permaculture being regenerative design. Sustainability is just about keeping things as they are, not letting it get any worse. Regenerative is about making things better and that's really very promising and very inviting. - (mumble) - [Lisa] It's so peppery. Isn't that nice? You know, in a setting like this which some might classify as suburban... I think it's pretty important to not focus on the negative aspects that suburbia has come to engender over the years. We have an enormous opportunity to take the neighborhoods we have and turn them into the villages we're going to need to navigate through the future, so whether you think of stringing a bunch of lawns togethers for food production, or all of the roofs that could be capturing energy and rain water, or just the geographic proximity of people and families to be able to team up together and make positive things happen. Just wanna welcome all of you and thank you for coming to this Perma blitz the idea being that we all pitch in together and we get an enormous amount of work done in one day for turning a permaculture design into reality. - [Little Boy] (mumble) - [Voiceover] You boys are so strong! - Doom and gloom and ultimatums of catastrophe are not necessarily the most compelling messages. I mean it's true that we need to be concerned about what's happening in the world and not hide from those realities. But at the same time, hold in our hearts, this amazing vision of what's possible. What could it be like if humans could help make this place sing with life. - [Lisa] So I'm really interested in taking the scope of permaculture and taking it really wide and looking at how does a whole region or whole community adapt this kind of systemic design lens and thinking. Pedal People was started 10 years ago and it's a worker co-op that uses bicycles and bike trailers to haul things. Somewhere along the line somebody said wow, a diesel truck, that's a great way we can pack a lot of trash on that, but when you look at the effect on our roads and we look at really the terrible effect that diesel fumes have on our communities, bicycles just are awesome. The whole business is really based on a principle that there's no such thing as waste. And Pedal People actually takes that waste and takes compost, literally, we started this in our pilot project, and uses that to build healthy soil. Taking out of the waste stream all the wonderful organic materials that are just going into the landfill and contributing to methane gas, but actually using that, pulling it out and building healthy soil. - [Steve] We moved to this house about 11 years ago in Plymouth, New Hampshire, and it's an 1890s house, and it's on a half an acre, and we did that with a lot of intention. As much as we would've liked to start it clean and be able to build exactly what we wanted in a way that we wanted, one of our thoughts was that so much of the housing stock that's needed is already built, and all the energy's been put into all these houses all across the nation, so could we take a house in a town that we really wanted to be in and start to retrofit it and actually embody permaculture. For us, the whole intent of putting a composting toilet in the house was part of trying to close the cycles of nutrients and energy as they flow on the property, and we realized we had a huge disconnect where we were eating all kinds of healthy, organic, local food, we were processing it really well with our bodies, and we were creating this really nutrient rich waste, human waste is really nutrient rich, I mean we use cow waste and all kinds of other manures in agriculture. And so we had this really nutrient rich waste that we were using clean drinking water to flush down a pipe to the sewage treatment plant. And so we realize there's a huge disconnect, so we were taking all this fertility and we were actually exporting it from our site, and it was becoming a really energy intense polluting issue. So we decided we could actually keep our waste home, capture it, and recycle it on site and use it to actually nourish the forest garden and the fruit trees. So this is basically the bottom part of the batch composting system, so all the waste from that second story bathroom that I showed you just comes down through this piece of road culvert And then there's a fan that actually just is exhausting any odor and any moisture from the system, just out of the house. And then inside that box is this drum. Just this pretty typical trash can on wheels. And that will hold, it'll fill probably about 60% of the way after about three to four months. We're gonna compost this material really well. It will have been sitting for a couple years and we can take it out and actually use it, so we're spreading it around, above the root system, the fruit tree, and then putting fresh mulch material on top. The trees are happy. - [Dwaine] Sneaky ailanthus. Who invited you to this party? Look at this, a field of dreams on top of a building. Green roofs literally are a vegetated system that cover most, or if not all of the surface area of a rooftop. We can integrate elements from the natural world into a developed space in a harmonious way to add not just beauty, but some functionality as well that you get in the natural world, you can bring that into a built space environment in a powerful way with green roofs. One of the great unspoken catastrophes happening in this city and cities like this across the country, across the world, is the enormous problems caused by sewage systems. So in a city like New York, rain water goes into a combined sewage system, so every time you use the toilet or wash your face or brush your teeth, that water goes into the same sewage system as storm water. This puts an enormous burden on the current model, infrastructure model for dealing with these kinds of environmental inputs. Large cities like New York city eject anywhere from 25 to 30 billion gallons of raw sewage into those surrounding bodies of water every single year, I mean that's just an astounding number. And that is having a catastrophic effect on ecologies that depend on those bodies of water that are near us and it's having a catastrophic effect on us because we're intimately connected to and dependent on those ecosystems. So if you've got living systems like this covering the city, you have a massive capability of absorbing almost all the storm water that falls over the city on top of buildings, this is one of the biggest contributors to combine sewage overflow. And I think one of the most important revolutions has happened in the last five or six years is that green roofs have now become a center for food production. So you can get all these other sort of cascading benefits, but now you can imagine that you can grow food. And on a green roof this size, you can grow enough food for several different communities that are local to this area. So these are the beehives. One of the principles of permaculture is the idea that, in a limited space, you can diversify the production that's happening in that space. And here you have built in pollinators for the food production and perennials that are planted on the other side of the green roof. So you have this mutually supporting relationship. And of course you get a little added bonus because you can rob a little honey when the time is right. When I got involved with green roofs I was working for a non-profit that really, you know, I had such a deep, I gained such a deep understanding of social justice working there, and one of the reasons that we were involved with creating green roofs is because the understanding was is that this was a way of not just improving the environment. Although that was our goal, our goal was to improve our immediate environment there in the South Bronx, but also to look at a way of creating unique and appealing jobs, opportunities for people who are really often not a part of that conversation. You know, really, it's about supporting human activities in a way that enables us to also support these essential relationships that we depend on. Brings us back into that web of interdependence. - [Andrew] We've got over 120 million people in the Northeastern corridor which is over one third of the United States population. Most of those people are living in urban epicenters. And what we're looking at as we tour around these sites in this landscape is ways to take the principles of permaculture and turn a problem into a solution. The dill here... Is a permaculture guild plant in that this plant attracts in beneficial pollinators. These two plants together create a symbiotic relationship where the dill is attracting in the insect that will eat the things that would have made holes on this. And so you end up with better looking kale and some dill to make your pickles with. So one of the main things we're out here to look at is this rain tank up here. Part of what's so great about this rain tank... Is that you don't even know there's a rain tank here. In a landscape where we get two to four inches of rainfall every single month, we could be catching, holding, storing, and using that rain water in our landscapes. This is one that we're looking at here that is a 1,000 gallon tank. The water for it is all coming from a church that is a large structure that's sitting next to the community garden, and the roof surface of that church sends all of its water into this 1,000 gallon tank, so we see a great example of another permaculture approach which is let's use biology to back up technology and here the biology is all these vines that are trellised over the tank. Prolong the life of the tank, increase the water quality by keeping light from getting into it. We'll see, I'll turn this one on so we can see the volume of water we're talking about. So when we catch it, hold it, and store it high, part of why this tank is so well placed is because it's at the highest point in the garden, so every place we go downhill, our water pressure will actually increase. For every foot of drop in elevation, you get one pound of PSI pressure in a water pipe. Tanks like this throughout the city in our community gardens are really an invaluable resource because this water flowing right now doesn't need any electricity from the grid, doesn't need any trucks, doesn't need any aqueduct from the cat skills. All it needs is to have this line from that tank be connected, and we've got gravity fed high pressure, high quality water. This would just be turning into a storm sewer overflow event, and now here it is becoming part of how we can grow super high quality nutritious foods. And people will ask us will permaculture work and what Bill Mollison said is will plants grow. (children laughing) - Not me! - [Paula] This is both an educational place, but really from the kids' point of view it's more of just a really pleasant place to hang out. And it's really beautiful, the idea that the garden is really part of the block. And so it's just integrated like all of the fruit plants and the vegetables are now a normal part of life. It became much easier to teach garden design when I was using permaculture principles because I wasn't... Designing something that they would think would be this disgusting amount of work that would turn them off to the whole project. Instead, we could design a playground where food is naturally growing throughout the playground. That that's a healthy part of this garden, that's not taking away from the garden, that it's adding to it. And the people sitting out front and playing cards adds to it, and that they're looking out over it and taking care of it. And that's all part of, to me, the permaculture idea, especially in the city. - [Ari] This neighborhood's called Waterfront South. And here in Waterfront South there's a lot of environmental issues because of our proximity to the river and to industry along the river. The storm water and household waste water treatment facility is like a block away and they process all of the store water and household waste water for Camden County. Historically, they've been really bad to the neighborhood and this neighborhood is known for having a certain smell that Camden as a city doesn't have. And made it so it wasn't like people wouldn't go play outside because of the smell, and so because of our closeness in proximity to the water treatment facility, we've come to realize that it's really important to find a way to recycle water and reuse water. - [Little Girl] Faster. - [Louis] Camden's an older city. It's been around for awhile, it's had its ups and downs, but yeah, the way the sewer system works is everything's going, all the pipes connect to the same route, they're not separated in any way. When it rains, all the rain water gets collected in that same area. So when it starts raining, and it goes on for a couple hours, it starts to flood, the system actually overflows into the streets and flooding is bad down here. So right here we got... We have these inverts in the sidewalks because the streets have a downward slope to them, but all the rain water rushes down the streets, comes through these vents, vents go straight across into the rain garden. They go across the rocks, it's almost like a natural filter, and they water this, these gardens. Before this happened, three years ago it was an abandoned gas station. Three years ago, an abandoned gas station and now it's a rain garden. It's a big contrast. Well after they had lifted the concrete and it was just dirt, we brought in soil, we started bringing plants, we started taking plants from our native plant nursery. It went from being that run down, abandoned gas station, really, just dead, to turning, it's like it's flourished and it turned into this. It's really lively, I can hear crickets, there's something living in here. This is just, this is rain water, this is that overflow. Yeah, like right here, not too long ago, this was an abandoned factory and it had got burned to the ground. And that's all that remains, that's all that's left standing was that tower. But definitely, if something were to happen here I'd love to see a rain garden put in. This, it's a massive lot. It's empty, that's all it's, it's already got life growing in it. Why not? I mean it's already growing plants. Why can't we, we could make it functional. - [Pandora] Talking, showing, sharing, and practicing to pave the ways people and the planet are all connections, so (mumble) about that. (mumble) and free colonizing roots, can I get an a-woman. (laughing) A-woman! Can I get an a-woman?! - (unison) A-women! - That's where my family used to, you know? That's the way, blah blah, oh that's kind of, well that's just... One of the most inspiring permaculture principles for me is the first one, this idea of observing and interact. It slow me down, it allows me to understand the flow and the wisdom that exists in a landscape that I might have the opportunity to learn from and co-design with. And it's the same with people. I work with formerly incarcerated men, so when I can talk to them about the permaculture principles and applying it to their life, they get it and they immediately apply it. Whether they have land or not, whether they have a window that they can plant seeds in, but they understand this permaculture lens starts with me, how I'm designing my life, and then how I'm meeting mine and other's needs for sustenance. Naturally that includes food, water, energy. So it's that integration and relationship building because I don't wanna assume that any person or group doesn't care about something. I wanna create capacity for people's needs to be heard. How do we meet people where they're at, and that to me is the on ramp. It's actually meeting people where they're at, acknowledging where they're at to be valid, and then co-designing this movement together. All 16 of the participants, you can make your way over. - I can give back now, you know, I mean I have children that can actually learn from me, you know what I mean? How to build garden boxes and run lines and drip systems and so on and so forth. And what's the importance of having healthy food. - [Voiceover] What we've been doing is we're planting 500 fruit tress, actually 494 to be exact. We got cherries, we got apples, and we have pears. - So that idea of observing and interacting is not just about the land that we're a part of, but it's all of the different areas that we are trying to transform in our lives. - [Charles] Permaculture is a lot more than simply applying a new set of techniques to nature that's viewed the same way as the past. It's not just a bunch of techniques to better manipulate the substrate of matter. It comes from a different understanding of matter. So to make an economy ecological, we have to understand what is true of the rest of life, and that means understanding ourselves as a part of nature. Not the lords and possessors of nature as Descartes put it. And as technology seems to make us think, you know, that a better world will come when we finally complete our dominance over all natural processes, over all other beings, we can control things at the genetic level, at the nano level. Then we'll have a perfect world. We're waking up from that because for one thing, that technological program is falling apart, and our control over nature has kind of backfired, so an economy that's aligned with permaculture and that supports permaculture would be an economy in which for example the best business decision is the same as the best ecological decision. - [Michael] Most of us know the saying an apple a day will keep the doctor away. It's certainly not true today. What we have to understand is how our food is grow has big implications for how medicinal that food is for us. I do this thing in my workshops and I ask who many of me do you see right now. And usually people will laugh and joke and say oh I see ten of you or two of you or one of you. And the right answer is I am a community of one trillion, and my skin is covered with bacteria. My respiratory tract, my digestive tract, and without all those allies, I would be in trouble. Well similarly out here in nature, there are all kinds of beneficial bacteria and beneficial fungi that cover the surface of plants. When we come in and spray fungicides, we're also depleting what's meant to be on the surface of the leaf. Really, the basic notion is I have a symptom and I'm going to do something to take care of that symptom by killing the organism causing the problem. On the other hand, a holistic spray is something that works with the system to build health. And that's where the true divide lies here. Is that spray allopathic, or is that spray holistic, are we supporting the system. So there's several items that go into my holistic spray mix, and the biology portion is effective microbes. And the way to think about this, it's not unlike a probiotic culture us going into the health food store and buying something to replenish out gut flora. Well effective microbes come to us out of the natural farming movement in Japan, and the microbes select the lactic acid bacteria, the photosynthetic bacteria, the different yeast are all competing organisms that i'm gonna apply out to the surface of the plant. And this is something that I actually brew, so there's a way to bring it up to heat to make these organisms multiply. So when I'm out here spraying, it's because I'm on the positive side, I'm looking for ways to enhance that nutrient uptake in the plant, enhance the coverage of the biology on the leaf and the fruit because that's all part of how the plant resists disease. All these different plants that make up this really bio diverse scene here in my orchard play all sorts of different roles. Here you see Queen Anne's Lace, all these umbelliferous flowers attract all kinds of parasitic wasps. Those parasitic wasps, as adults, need the nectary to be here. They in turn go out and find the larvae of the codling moth or the oriental fruit moth and put their egg inside that larvae and destroy it, so they're part of my insect balancing plan. It's through biodiversity that we bring in all kinds of allies. I've always loved the idea of... The permanent part of the word permaculture, this notion that we live in a place and we're committed to it just as much as it's committed to us. That through stewarding it, by creating biodiversity, we start to have part of what is the answer to a lot of our big issue problems that overwhelm us. - [Keith] Riparian basically means along the water, and a riparian buffer means a more diverse ecology along our water's edge. Most of our farms of course are farming right to the edges of the rivers and we see that being some of the most erosion prone land. In the Summer of 2011 here in Vermont we were hit by tropical storm Irene which did tremendous damage to our farms to the point of some farms being literally washed away to the underlying bedrock, essentially losing all of their topsoil because their land was in bare cultivation with no protection from the action of the river and from the action of flood getting over the banks and moving swiftly over their fields. What we see here is your standard pattern of riverbank erosion, so the goal here is to aggressively establish deep rooted plants and root masses to better stabilize this. But yeah, you can see I mean these ones, you know, they weren't planted like that pretty obviously, but they're still rooted and this Spring has been, we've seen two floods this Spring, we just had a 100-year flood, and these plants are holding on even as the banks crumble underneath them unlike the grasses which tend to break off and wash away, they have deeper roots and they hold more soil, so the buffer isn't simply to absorb nutrients running off the farm. the buffer is also to protect it from wind, the buffer is also to shade the stream the buffer is also to prevent erosion, the buffer is also to provide food, the buffer is also to provide medicine, the buffer is also to provide habitat. So I have lost track, right, but when we talk about stacking functions, we see that we're getting multiple yields from this one endeavor. - For most of human history, most humans in most places in the world having been getting their food from forests. That's definitely some good... This is very traditional, this has probably been done for thousands of years in Asia. And it's very different from most mushroom production which is done indoors on lots of sawdust where you're controlling the temperature and the humidity and constantly putting energy inputs into the system. And here we're out in the woods, you know, and the woods provide all the right context for these to grow and flourish. It's a little variable, this week's a little wet, so they're a little bit different, but by and large the logs then respond to the conditions of the forest which is where they come from. And I like to believe where they wanna be. It's kind of nice out here, nice fresh air. I worked at a nature center. We were thinning our sugar bush for maple syrup and had all these small diameter logs like this one that we had enough firewood, we were like there's gotta be something else we can do with these, so we learned some guy up the road was growing shiitakes on logs. We said let's have him for our class. We did it, it was kind of weird, he plugged a bunch of things in a log and they're sitting there and they don't look like anything is happening. And a year later of course, first flush and I was pretty hooked just at the beauty of them and the nutritional value and just the flavor. And then we're decomposing this log, right? So if you just dropped a tree it would decompose anyway, we might as well decompose it with something that's edible, and then it eventually goes back into the forest soil, so we're plugged in in a really nice way to this whole forest system that's gonna happen anyway, the trees are gonna fall over, die, decompose. But we're inserting this piece where we're getting this really high value, high sustenance food product in the meantime. You can have that win win scenario where the forest benefits, we benefit, and we engage in the cycle, right, we're just the facilitator of decomposition. The mushrooms are doing most of the work really in the end. There's a slug. Gotta get the ducks back in here. That's our biggest predator, so to speak. You know, from permaculture, Bill Mollison was known for saying you don't have a slug problem, you have a duck deficiency, so that there's something missing from an ecosystem which gets it out of balance and the slugs in the mushroom yard is the system a little bit out of balance. (ducks honking) The eggs are bi-products for a surplus of their activity as pest control agents on the farm. So their main job here is to root around and dig out slugs and bugs and fertilize, and the eggs are just helping as a surplus of that activity. As a product for us to sell. What this is about is whatever species you're working with, plant or animal, how does it wanna thrive, and how can you create the conditions for that? 'Cause then it just goes crazy, you know, if you give it the right conditions, it just explodes with health. The principle that Mollison said is everything gardens, we're just a piece in the whole ecosystem, and that's a big shift from what I've seen of industrial agriculture which is that we command the ecosystem, we tell it what to do and it obeys us. What we're talking about here is that I'm just a part of it, but the birds in this forest, the trees in this forest, the rodents, the slugs, the ducks, are all playing their role and we're just orchestrating those relationships and trying to shift little pieces at a time and let it exist as its own ecosystem and see ourselves as just a 1/10 of that ecosystem or 1/100th rather than it's all about us, you know, it's really ego driven and I think that's the shift of permaculture from agriculture is how we place in it rather than imposing on top of it. - [Rhamis] If you look at the natural world... If you look at the forest or jungle or savannah or grassland, what is the primary energy input? It's the sun. And there's water and there's wind, you know, those are the inputs, and then somehow, through those energy inputs, it's able to create this amazing infrastructure. So you get wood, leaves, and you got all the biology that's connected to it. You have all these amazing lifeforms that come from that process, that photosynthesis, that autotrophic process, being able to take the energy, the nutrients that are in the atmosphere, the light that comes from the sun and then convert that into... Into matter. That's incredible! Technologically, that is amazing! And we don't have anything that comes anywhere near that. So why would you not leverage that technology to form the basis upon which the systems that you rely upon to live, why not leverage that technology? Why not leverage that infrastructure? And in doing so, realize that your ability to exist is predicated on its ability to exist. And that if you undermine it, you undermine yourself. - Here's a pound, okay? (distant singing) - [Susana] When you get into growing crops like we're doing on the scale of an acre here, the dry beans and pintos, black turtle beans and the other beans like the whippoorwill peas and the cow peas that you, try the oats and the wheat. It's very difficult for people to get their head around how to do that without tractors and combines and tillage. Masanobu Fukuoka was a Japanese rice farmer that wrote two books that are important to people in the permaculture movement and both of them were helpful to me, The Natural Way of Farming and The One Straw Revolution. The biggest thing was he didn't till the soil. So he talked about planting the next crop into that crop that was growing when it's about time to harvest so that it takes over and you don't have weeds, really, are trying to cover the soil, so if you do that job for them, then you don't have that cycle of weeds, so if you plant the crop, the next crop into the crop and that really was very helpful for me because I couldn't believe that beans would just germinate when sewn, everything told me well you have to drill it in, they have to be buried a quarter inch and to see that it works with mulch and that you just scythe your mulch in place and the beans come through it. After we harvest the dry beans out of the field, then the chickens go in there and clean up. The way animals are treated in the industrial system is basically it's a one way loop, we're not closing the loop, animals are mistreated, but they're also losing many resources that they provide in a holistic system, and when they're treated well they give back. The ducks are great in going around and getting insects and eating and foraging. They're largely self sufficient. The Three Sisters is a great example of a poly-culture. The roles of the three crops growing together, they help each other out, the beans being a nitrogen fixer, fix nitrogen, extra nitrogen for the soil which is taken up by the other crops. The squash and the pumpkins cover the soil, you can see how they're doing it in the cornfield. You just work with the field as a diverse poly-culture and all three crops help each other out. One of the things that many farmers try, they try to get maybe four to five percent organic matter for example in this soil and the soils tests have come back 18% organic matter here, in fact often they say it's compost because of the way we built this soil up here and that's something that organic farmers are always finding, they're always trying to find ways to get organic matter and nutrients into the soil, but still feeling the need to till, so that transformation from tillage is the biggest obstacle. It's the obstacle of scale, and it's a social obstacle as well because it's looking at the farm in a very different way. - [Mark] Every culture that has based its staple food crops diet, now staple foods are the carbohydrates, proteins and oils. Every culture that's based its staple food crops diet on annual plants has collapsed. Now an annual plant is a plant that the seed goes in the ground, grows one years, puts out a prodigious amount of seed, and then dies. If you're growing annual plants, you have to destroy the ecosystem that's there to expose the soil, so you go and you eradicate that ecosystem, now you're planting your annual crops, now your soil is exposed to the wind and the rain and it does wash away, it goes down into the streams. There's no life there anymore, it's gone. Life, it's devoid of life, you might as well be on Mars. That's why we need permaculture, we need a permanent agriculture. We need a agriculture that actually restores ecosystem services instead of an agriculture that goes in and degrades a resource base, wipes it out and washes it all out to sea. What were the plants that naturally occurred here and belong here and let's create a system that imitates the form of that ecosystem and its ecosystem functions. (indistinct chatter) When you look at what is your region, your biome, what was the vegetation like here 300 years ago, 150 years ago, 6,000 years ago, what was the range of species that grew in your area. Then start to imitate that, say okay, pick out the ones that have economic potential. Pick out tall trees, medium trees, shorter trees, shrubs, cane fruits, vines that are specific for your region, and every region's different. The model I do the most work with is the most widespread in North America, the Oak Savanna, it ranges all across North America. Wherever you found Oak Savanna, in order of height you'd find the Fagaceae which were oak, chestnut, or beach, they all produce large nuts. Apples, malice, prior to Europeans there were little prairie crabs. The dominant shrub in Oak Savanna was hazelnut. Then there were raspberries and blackberries kind of crawling out, then there were vines climbing all over the whole mess, grapes was the most widespread furthest South you have passion fruit. Who eats the grass? The Oak Savannas were teaming, teaming with wildlife. the Pleistocene megafauna with the mastodons, woolly mammoth, Colombian mammoth. This was the most productive photo-synthetically and biologically productive savanna on the planet. So productive that some of the soil South of Chicago were like 200 feet deep of the most rich black dark topsoil ever seen. That rich dark topsoil was created by all those plants that I just mentioned and all those grazing animals tearing trees down, eating grass, leaves, bushes, vines, pooping and peeing, reproducing, killing each other for zillenia. That's how the soil was created after the glaciers pulled back. It was created by this type of biology right here. When we look at that system, if that's what here, the Oak Savanna was here, let's plant those different families with selected plants that we've done breeding work on to have improved yields, improved disease resistance, pest resistance, and let's use the animals to do the weed control and the fertility management and a lot of the pest control so that animals are driving the system, just like in nature, and we're harvesting all the yields that come off of the various different perennial woody crops. One of the things, because this is so far North, when you get a week of 20 degree weather, the burs will freeze shut and the nut gets ruined. And so when I'm saving for seed, I want the earliest ripening ones. There's a bunch. Now the classic perennial crop staple foods are nuts. We've got chestnut trees here. There are chestnut trees that are over 4,000 years old, there's one on the Eastern flank of Mount Etna growing out of the solid rock. It still sets the record of having the largest diameter trunk of any tree on the planet, you know, beats Redwoods and everything, it's that big and that old, 4,000 years it's been producing a grain equivalent with no inputs. Anything that you would use an annual grain for... You know, breads, pastas, use it like a potato in soups and stews. We know that nature, nature functions with no inputs. It doesn't take any fertilizer from some factory somewhere else, it doesn't need natural gas to make pesticides and herbicides and fungicides. I've actually touched hazelnut trees that were planted by the Romans. They're still there, still producing hazelnuts, what, 300 a.d. so that's like 16, 17, 1,800 years later still producing hazelnuts. These are some of the oldest chestnuts. We did this alley cropping, we were growing zucchini in between. it's five rows of zucchini. Then as the trees got bigger, we moved into three rows of zucchini, then we went down to one row of zucchini, doing one row of zucchini was a waste of time, and so then you observe the rest of the system I see weeds coming in. The weeds that were coming in were mulberry, raspberry, elderberry, grapes. And so then we planted them right down, right down the middle of the rows. This was a corn farm, I also worked with farmers to do exactly that transition. Where we're entering into now on our transition, we've already gone from the cornfields to this diverse system. Now we're getting to the point where things are closing in, the canopy's closing in and our grass component is disappearing. And so now we're starting to manage with a chainsaw. So we're now removing trees, now we're gonna have to remove trees always and forever. Think about that, our management system now demands that we cut trees down. Crap, we have to make boards, firewood, mushrooms, toilet paper, all that kind of stuff, we have to harvest this wood or else we get decreasing yields. Hi, pigger. How you doing, you want a belly rub? Want the belly rub, come on, give me the belly, pig, belly pig, come on, belly pig, there you go, good girl. Here we go, there's my buddy. Everybody has looked in their rear view mirror before and seen a police car. What happens to you, instantly your whole entire body chemistry changes, and pats, they are not being chased. Your whole body chemistry changes, you are a radically different physical organism. So if you have animals that live like this, and they experience love and joy and pats, they not being chased by a police car, and then what we do, we're gonna start doing it right now is we feed them on the trailer towards the end in the morning, give them their snacks. So they're used to loading on a trailer, we don't have any squeeze chutes, any of that, you just call and they run up on the trailer. Then you shut the door and they have one bad day. Oh hi, how are you? How are you? The animals that we have there, they are savanna species. It just so happens that the ones that we have right here aren't the North American variations of the savanna species. So we have, we have cattle and hogs and sheep and chickens and turkeys and ducks and guineas. And then some of the animals eat the grasses, some eat the broad leaves, some eat thorny stuff, some eat brush, and then turkeys are mostly insect eaters, the chickens are mostly seed eaters. And so the chickens are going around eating weed seeds and some bugs, caterpillars and stuff. They all eat different parts of the ecosystem and the tree crops, that's what we reserve to us, and if you were just looking for a vegetarian diet between hazelnuts and chestnuts that's a complete protein. (laughing) Let's go look at the corn. Corn has its place, but it's definitely not over like 60% of the continent. But yeah, look at that! Even in its prime, there wasn't any more than eight feet of photosynthesis going on there. And they produce however million calories per acre, but it's not an ecosystem, there's no wildlife out there, there's... Their water actually runs off onto our farm then we collect it and store it and reuse it here. Look how brown that cornfield is. Look how green my trees are. And it was actually some students at University of Illinois last year, they did the analysis and even if we are getting, if you look at all the yields of the different crops from hazelnut to chestnut, grapes, raspberries, currants and livestock gains and pasture forage, even if we got the low end of the range of all of the crops we grow, we are outproducing corn by about 30% total human calories per acre. I'm a proponent of doing things to a real scale and if we are going to be creating permanent agriculture, that means growing food for people, that doesn't mean planting a nut tree in your front yard, that means hundreds and hundreds and thousands of millions of acres of food productivity, there's, I think it's like over 100 million acres of corn that's out there this year, we need hundreds of millions of acres of food producing savannas and forests and all the different vegetation types, hundreds of millions of acres, but let's have a mechanized ecological paradise. If we walk away from this place right here, it'll still be producing crops for the next couple thousand years. - [Voiceover] That's a good sound. (ducks honking) You know the word designer is very misleading. Designer sounds like oh, well we know what we're doing all the time, right, we know exactly what we're doing, we're the designer. No, we're just facilitators, right, we're just assemblers, we're orchestrators. But we can't play all of the instruments. We can make sure they're on the stage and hopefully they can play their instruments well, but the symphony that comes out of that? That's the magic, we just can assemble the components and kind of have faith in that the symphony will come forth, and it does, that's the crazy thing is it does come forth. You put the pieces of the puzzle together in beneficial interrelationship, this is just all that permaculture is, and the symphony starts to play. We don't have to know how to do it all. 'Cause we don't, we will never know how to do it all. All we have to do is start assembling the pieces. (guitar music)
