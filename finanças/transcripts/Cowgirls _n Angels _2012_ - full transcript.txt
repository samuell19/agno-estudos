25.000 English from DVD-PAL RETAiL The only difference between cowgirls and angels... my granddaddy used to say... is that angels can't ride as good. Cowgirls 'n Angels (2012) I wouldn't call myself a cowgirl. And I'm not much of an angel, either. The truth be told, I'm not really a rodeo fan. But it was summertime, and the rodeo was the most exciting thing around. I'm not exactly your typical Oklahoma girl. See, I'm half-orphan, which means I don't have a daddy. And my mama works all the time. So I'm basically on my own. I did have a granddaddy. He was a rodeo trick rider. One of the best. When I was real little, he'd tell me... "It's not enough for a man to know how to ride. He's gotta know how to fall." Well, I couldn't ride a horse to save my life. I have to admit, though, it sure looked like fun. - Yeehaw! - Hey! What are you doin' in my purse? - Get outta there! Get on! - Hey! What are you doin' under here? Come here. Hey, you can't get away from me, now-- Hey! Just stop! All right. Come on out of there. Hi. Security guard went that way. I suggest you go that way. Thank you, sir. - Don't let me catch you in here again. - I promise! It's okay, boy. Hey. Hey, boy. Come on. Step off it. Come on. Work with me, boy. Here we go. Come on over here. What are you doin' out here, huh? All you need is just a little love. Good boy. Here we go. All right, girls, listen up. Real nice job, ladies. Just a few little things I noticed I think we can improve on. Nora, when we crack the whip, you gotta keep up, okay? I know. Has to be a tassel-- Hi. That was an awfully great show, everybody. Thank you! Like I said, I ain't much of an angel, either. Yep. The only ridin' I did was on my old bicycle. One thing was for sure. I wasn't gonna tell my mama I was hanging out at rodeos. She hated the rodeo. "Rodeo's nothin' but a bunch of deadbeats", she'd say. And by rodeo... she really just meant my daddy. Hey, Punky Brewster, just checkin' in on ya. I know I promised to swing by the market. But we are shorthanded tonight. You know the drill. Gotta be somethin' left in the old fridge, right? Love you. Love you too. Mama made it clear a long time ago. No talkin' 'bout my daddy. Wouldn't even tell me his name. But just like a Texas Ranger, I had my ways. "Elaine... I'm sorry for the sudden departure. I'll always remember you. Walker." Can you think of a cooler name for your daddy than that? I mean, I'm not tryin' to get down, but... that's only the third rodeo since spring, and there ain't been a-- Sorry. There hasn't been a "Walker" at any of them. I mean, at this rate, my grandkids are gonna still be lookin' for him. Okay. All right. Just wait a second. Ho. Easy. Okay, boy. Gosh. You're too big. That's the problem. Point your toes. Keep 'em straight. - Up, up, up! - Come on strong! Rose, when you touch the ground, you gotta jump back up. That's better. Good girl. Dang. - Madison, that ain't funny. - It's funny to me, Kansas. You just don't have a well-developed sense of humor like I do. Don't worry about it. Hey. Okay. Who was in here last night? Looks like the gelding got loose again. What's the matter with that horse, Augustus? Nothin' but trouble. Lock was broken. Found this. Come on. Keep up the speed! You gotta sell it! - There you go, Terence. - Thank you, Alice. And how are you doin'? Well, I get up every morning... and make it to bed most nights. So I guess I should count my blessings. You hang in there. You sure do mean a lot to all of us. Thank you, Alice. I appreciate the kind words. - Beg pardon, ma'am. - That's okay. Excuse me, ma'am. You have a nice day now. You too. I swear I was gonna pay for it. Is that why you were halfway out the door? - No! I was halfway in the door! - You save your story for the sheriff. There you are. Thought I told you not to run off like that. - Is she with you, Terence? - Uh-huh. Well, it looks like she was trying to make off with this bottle of aspirin. It's for my mama. She's got a real bad headache, and it's extra-strength. Sorry about that, Marta. I'll give her a good talkin'-to. Come on, kid. So, what's your name, kid? Ida Clayton... Mr. Parker, sir. And how is it that you know my name? You're Terence Parker. Used to ride in the rodeo. You were almost as good as my granddaddy. That a fact? Jim Clayton. Ever heard of him? So, how are things at home, Ida? Everything okay with you and your folks? Just me and my mama. Never knew my daddy. Well, you best be gettin' on home. Imagine your mama's waitin' for these aspirin. Yep! Yep. Gotta run. Thank you, sir. Whoa, boy. All right. Okay. I promise I'm gonna get on you. If you just give me a second, I'll do it. Come on. All right. Good boy. There we go. Let's go for a little spin, huh? Boy, slow down! Come on. He's a beauty, ain't he? Takes somethin' special to ride a horse like this. How'd you feel about ridin' with the Sweethearts? Don't take this the wrong way, but... did you forget to take that medicine that you got? Come on now. How about it? What are you afraid of? I'm about the worst rider in the world. Sweethearts goin' out on a big tour. Rodeos all over the West. And Rebecca-- That's my daughter-- She's lookin' for a couple of alternates. Did you say all over the West? If I help you, you gotta do something for me. Yes, sir. No more lyin'. No more stealin'. You gotta ask your mama's permission. Thank you, sir. Come on. Come on. No way. Absolutely not. But, Mom, come on! It's Terence Parker! I don't care about Terence Parker. Anyway, you don't even know how to ride a horse. Oh, well, I do so! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! Summer camp. That was two years ago. The rodeo's no place for a little girl. - It's just a bunch of-- - Deadbeats? You sure you not talkin' about what's-his-face picking you up tonight? He's not that bad. There he is. No on the rodeo. I got my phone on me. I'll be back by midnight. You sure you're okay? I always am. Okay. Just for a little while. Mr. Parker... "I would be honored, Mr. Parker--" She really wanted to come out today... but it's just so hard to get off of work. - Okay. Let's get you on in there. - Yes, sir. - In you go. - All right. - Howdy. - Howdy. Now, don't you want to name him first? You want me to name him? Hi. Well... I think... that your name should be Prince. - Prince. - Prince it is. - Go on. Get up. - All right. All right, now hold on a second. First thing I want you to remember is that you and this horse are a team. Every team has a leader. So that makes you the leader of the Ida-Prince team. - Yes, sir. - All right. Let's get you on up. - All right. - On three. One, two, three. - There we go. - All right now. Hi, Prince. You just hold on to the reins and tell him where to go. - You might wanna put your heel into it. - I got it. I'm sure that you do. But you still gotta listen to me. That's part of the deal. - All right? Off you go. - Yes, sir. Show him who the boss is. I'm the boss! - What are you doin' over here? - I don't know! Get on over there. Go on. That horse should be riding you. Come on. Faster! All right. - Here's the turn! They're watchin'! - That's right. Good boy. That's it. Now hold him up. Hold him up. Attagirl, Ida. Lookin' good. Keep it up, boy. Good boy. - Good girl. - Good job. - You're as ready as you're gonna get. - Here. You deserve it. Better, boy? Then, Madison, you'll be up, okay? And then you'll go last on Friday. Howdy. Howdy. This here's the young lady I was tellin' you about. Rebecca, I'd like you to meet Ida Clayton. You're Jim Clayton's granddaughter? Yes, ma'am. How old are you? I'm two years older than Mr. Parker when he started performin', ma'am. Okay. Well, why don't you go ahead and show us what you can do? - And you can lose the "ma'am." - Oh, yes, m-- You gotcha. Okay. All right, Prince. Okay. - Ride like the wind. - Thank you. That's a different way to get up on the horse. She's learnin'. Didn't you once tell me... "You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear"? Come on, now. Just give her a chance. You gotta admit, she shows promise. Form's not bad. Let's see. Not bad, Ida. Thanks for comin' out today. Thank you, Miss Parker. Sorry for wastin' y'all's time. You'll fit in just fine. Welcome to the Sweethearts of the Rodeo. Seriously? Wait. I'm in? Thank you, Miss Parker. I promise I won't be a problem at all to any of you. Thank you. Rebecca, we done? I got some laundry I gotta fold. No, we are not done. We have a new member who needs to practice. And I'd like to try her out on Friday night. Congratulations. I'm Kansas. Good job. Hi. We'll see if she can really ride. Race y'all to the well. Come on, girls! Let's go! I used to think of people as a great big box of crayons... and each one of us had our own special color... that God would scribble into his book of life. Only up till now, I thought my color was "clear." Come on, boy! Howdy, partners. I'm Ida. Yeehaw! Why, yes, I'm a cowgirl. Occupied! One second. Ida, now! I'm late for work. Give me a moment! What? Is that makeup on your face? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. See? I'm just goofin' around. That's all. Oh, Lord. You've discovered boys. I'll be back by 10:00. Hey, babe. I forgot my purse. What a beautiful day for a rodeo. That's right. We're gonna have us a calf-ropin'... bronco-bustin', barrel-racin' afternoon. - Ida. - Hey, Augustus. - Hi, preacher. - Howdy. Why do people call you preacher? That's what I am. The rodeo preacher. So, you, like, pray for the riders or somethin'? Oh, yeah. Riders, animals, even new members of the Sweethearts. Anyone who may need help. Come on. It's just me and you. Well, now look at you all gussied up. Is your mama gonna make it tonight? My mama, sir? Oh, no. No. She has to work. - That's too bad. - Yeah. Well, get up on there. Let's do it. - Okay. - They're waitin' on you. - Hi, Prince. - Come on. Yes. Mr. Mack, I realize I am late. But-- No. You're not listenin' to me. I have to go get my daughter. All right, girls. If you feel it, I wanna hear ya. Keep your lines tight. If you make a mistake, just keep ridin'. Kansas, keep an eye on Ida. Hey, Ida, don't be nervous. Just have fun. Make a ruckus! That's what Sweethearts do best. Sweethearts of the Rodeo. All right! Ride 'em like you stole 'em! Yeah! That's so funny. Step on up, folks. Line up. Can I have your autograph? - Wait. You want mine? - Aren't you the new Sweetheart? Well, I guess I am. What's it like to be a Sweetheart of the Rodeo? It's better than anything in the whole wide world. Sign mine "No-good stinkin' liar." - Mom, I swear I can explain. - Yeah, you always can. - Get outta here. - That hurts! - Ma. Mama, that hurts. - Ma'am? Ma'am? I reckon you must be Ida's mom. And I reckon you must be the one who put her up to this. Well, no. Not exactly. She gave me the letter you wrote. But I-- If you actually believe I wrote this, then you're dumber than I thought you were. Mom! That hurts! You just ruined the best thing that's ever happened to me! Pretty sad if this is the best thing that ever happened to you. Well, how would you know? When all you care about is your dumb old job! Yeah, I care about my job so much, I just threw it away so I could look for you! Right along with any chance of me ever findin' my daddy! Wait. That's what this is about? You actually think you're gonna just stroll into every rodeo this side of Louisiana... and say, "Hi. I'm Ida. Which one of you is my daddy?" You're gonna be waitin' in a long line. Well, maybe if I didn't know his name. But I do, and it's Walker! So ha! What are you gonna do if you find him, huh? Transform magically into a respectful and loving daughter? Baby, listen to me. Listen. There's only one thing you need to know about your daddy. And that's the fact that he deserted us. He did. He deserted us. You just have to accept that and move on. Oh, me? Me, move on? You're the one who keeps him stuffed in your closet! All right? He is gone. All right? Gone! I hate you! I hate you! Oh, hey. There's Kim now. Nice job, girls. We gotta get all this loaded up so we can get on the road by 10:00. Sorry, Rebecca, but I'm not goin'. Well, why not, Kim? Kenny doesn't want me to be away that long. I didn't know it was up to Kenny. I'm sorry. What are we gonna do? We should bring Ida back. That crazy lady is not lettin' her anywhere near us. After she lied, I'm not sure I want her back. Well, I think we all knew she was lyin'. I'm just startin' to think maybe she's too much trouble. That's all. - I think you said that about me once. - And me. Definitely said that about me. You even said that about me. Weak. Well, I don't know what I would do with Ida... but now that I'm unemployed, I could really use the money. Okay. Let me call you first thing tomorrow morning, and I'll let you know. All right. Thanks. Who was that? Carrie wants me to go to Oklahoma City... and help her with her catering for a few weeks. - You gonna do it? - I don't know, okay? I'll figure it out. Howdy, ma'am. - I'm Terence Parker. - I know who you are. Yeah, well, look, Miss Clayton. You and me kinda got off on the wrong foot, and I was thinkin'-- My daughter's not ridin' with you. So you might as well just turn around and go. Miss Clayton, the Sweethearts, they give everyone a fresh start in life. Sweethearts takes 'em all in and gives 'em a second family. Well, Ida's already got a family. I know that. And a mighty fine mom too. How would you know that? Because I knew your daddy. And I know how much care he put into raising ya. Even if you did start out as an ornery little thing no higher than my knee. Yes, sir. Jim was a good man. And a fine cowboy. Sure looked out for me. Wish someone would've looked out for him. You and me both. I think he'd be proud to know that Ida was ridin' with us. Don't you dare tell me what my daddy would've wanted, Mr. Parker. And don't you go usin' his memory for your personal gain. You're right. Sorry. That was out of line. I don't know if I mentioned that there's pay involved? Seventy-five dollars a performance. Twelve performance works out to be about-- about $900. Times is hard right now. For all of us. I could pay you half up front, and... well, the rest of it when we come back. And I'd be personally responsible for Ida. Girls, now that's not very nice, now, is it? You said we should be practicing our roping. Not on Sierra. Yeah, well, they said they was gonna come see us up in Fremont... but I'll believe that when I see it. Five years of ridin' rodeos, my parents have only come to see me one time. Must be hard for you. - Nope. I don't care one way or the other. - What about your folks, Ida? Did you hear Chuck Norris found a way to make butter without churnin' it? He just roundhouse kicks the cow, and it comes out butter. - I hate those stupid Chuck Norris jokes. - No. Do another. - Hey there. - How can I help you? I'm Rebecca Parker with the Sweethearts. The Sweethearts of the Rodeo. - Heard a lot about you. - Thank you. - Dean Stucky, Selby's manager. - Hi, sir. Gimme a sec. Lemme grab your paperwork. Okay. Careful there, little lady. This here's some sensitive information. Okay. If you'll just sign those, I will grab y'all's passes. You see, Mr. Stucky, I've been tryin' to call you all day. It's very important that we get a chance... to practice in the arena before tomorrow night's show. - Why is that? - We always do. The girls and the horses need to get familiar with their surroundings... so we don't have any accidents. Dang. I am sorry to say... ring's all booked up tomorrow. Well, what about tonight? Now come on. Now you know these gals just gonna prance around in their pretty little britches. The only accident they may have... one of them may get their makeup smudged a little dab. Practice. Look here, Mr. Stucky. My name's Terence Parker. Case you don't recognize the name, that's me up there on that wall. Me and my wife started the Sweethearts of the Rodeo over 25 years ago. Now, all I'm askin' you is to make that dirt available tonight. And show these ladies some respect. If you don't... I'm gonna give you such a whoopin', you won't sit down for a month. Well-- Okay, Mr. Parker. Well-- Why don't I just meet you on out there? She's pretty. Yeah! I seen her first there, buddy. Come on, Daddy. Please be in here. Are you dumber than a box of dirt? What are you doin' in here? - Kansas! - What are you doing? - I'm trying to find my daddy. - What is that smell? Come on-- What in the Sam Hill are you girls doin' in here? Nothin'. Looks like somethin' to me. I was tryin' to find out about a cowboy that I met tonight. And... Ida must have woke up and followed me. I'm sorry. It was stupid. Darn right it was stupid. If word of this got out to any sponsors-- Nothin' was missin' here. I ain't gonna press any charges. - I was young once too. - Thank you. It won't happen again. I promise. Mr. Parker? Yeah? It's me, Ida. Can I come in? Sure thing. Come on in. Shut the door and make yourself at home. Is that your sweetheart? That's my wife, Gracie. She's beautiful. Yeah. Where's she at now? Well, Ida, I guess you could say she's with the angels. I'm sorry. You needn't be. She's in good hands. And I'm doin' okay down here. I reckon we'll be together soon enough. What's on your mind? Well-- Kansas. She-- She shouldn't take the blame for something I did, sir. I'm sorry for lyin' to you... about my mama and... for not doin' my chores when you told me to. And the other million things that I haven't even done yet... but, I mean, I will. Yeah, that's all. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go now. Yeah. Okay. Oh, and, Ida-- Yes, sir. Thanks for tellin' the truth. You're welcome. Why didn't you just ask for help? Yeah, why didn't you tell us about your daddy? Hey! Kansas. What's your daddy's name? It's Walker. His first name is Walker. That's all I know. Oh, I get it. Walker, Texas Ranger. Chuck Norris, bad jokes. It's cute. Wait. Chuck Norris is your father? No. Her father's a Texas Ranger. No, her dad's just a dude named Walker. So, what's your daddy like? Well, I've never met him before. But I've dreamt about him more times than I can count. He's always the same. He's nice, funny and helpful. He cares about me more than anything in the whole wide world. He's definitely a good daddy. I just know it. Well, if there's any justice in this world... I'm sure you'll be reunited with your daddy. So, should we start lookin'? Hey, excuse me. - Any of y'all named Walker? - No, ma'am. Do you all know anyone named Walker? - No, ma'am. Sorry. - All right then. - Hey. Either of you boys named Walker? - No, ma'am. Thank you. I think there's some guys down by the breeding barn. Hey! - One of y'all named Walker? - Honey, I can be any name you want. How about Ricky Rodeo? All hat and no cattle. So no? Okay. - All right. Thank you, sir. - Sure. You've only been to one rodeo. Didn't think it'd be that easy, did ya? Don't give up hope. We'll find your daddy. I've been waitin' this long. I reckon I can wait a little bit longer. All right now, ladies, keep your spacing. Don't cut the pin. Terence, there's somethin' wrong with my stirrup. Well, let me take a look. - Go on. Back. - Prince, stop. - I need a piece of rope. - All right. Try this. This year's Landon Rodeo Queen, Jean Simms... and Princess Brooke Stevens. Ida, you were supposed to check the saddles. - I did. - It was your chore. No, it's too thick. I need somethin' I can tie. Oklahoma's own the Sweethearts of the Rodeo. And as they get ready to go, they make some very last-minute details... - What are you doin'? - Make sure everything is taken care of. - What about your blood clots? - I won't have 'em off long enough. Ida, you wanna be a Sweetheart, you pull your own weight, got that? Yes, ma'am. Y'all are on now, girls. Let's go. All right. That'll do 'er. - Come on, Dad. - Go. Oklahoma's own, the Sweethearts of the Rodeo. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, Madison-- As she'll make her way around the arena... she'll attempt another high-flyin' danger maneuver. There's a lot of trust between the horse and the cowgirl tonight. Rose will lay over the neck of her horse at a full gallop. Once again, a round of applause for the Sweethearts of the Rodeo. Wish me luck. Well, hey there. Annie Oakley. Annie Oakley was a sharpshooter, not a rider. - Well, I stand corrected. - Just sayin'. That was some fancy ridin' you were doin' tonight. Thank you. - What is wrong with you? - I don't know. Leave me alone. - He's cute. - Hey there! Cowboy! - Ida! - What's your name? Justin Wood. What's yours? - I'm Ida Clayton. - Pleased to meet you, Miss Clayton. This here's Kansas. She's a little shy. But trust me, she's real pleased to meet you. - See ya. - Stop. - What are you doin'? - Don't yell at me. We're gonna speed things up a little bit and do a song I wrote called "Come On." - You wanna dance? - Sure. Wanna dance? Come on, girls. Come on. Let's dance. - All right. - Come on. Come on You can dance. Thank you guys so much. I'm gonna slow it down a little bit for you guys... and do a father-daughter song. I'm going to actually get some help from my special dad. So if you guys would help me welcome Mr. Doug Grant. Do you remember how I begged you To read Cinderella to me Every night? I must've read it a thousand times When Billy Wilson asked another Girl to go to the junior prom You thought your world would end You said I'd live through it I can always count on you To make it right Make me smile Knowin'that makes me feel safe This world can be a scary place You're always there Always there for me My baby daughter Off to Nashville I know. Hi. It's Elaine. Sorry I couldn't take your call. Leave a message. Even where we're-- To a great performance tonight. I'll drink to that. So, how did you get a name like Kansas? My mom and daddy said that I was conceived in Kansas... on a road trip that they took right after they eloped. - I think Kansas is nice. - Thanks. All right, let's go. Rebecca! Justin's gonna take me home. - I don't think so. - I'll catch up with you later. I wouldn't count on it, cowboy. Rebecca, what is wrong with you? You are about as sharp as a marble, aren't you? Let go! Do you even remember what brought you to the Sweethearts in the first place? Rebecca, I've changed. Have you? Because last night you were breakin' and enterin'. And tonight you're throwin' back longnecks with John Wayne Jr. Looks to me like you're hell-bent on gettin' sent back to prison. It was a correctional institute. Whatever it was, do you ever wanna walk through those doors again? Well, then you gotta stay clean. And stay away from that cowboy. You hear me? Yes, ma'am. Hey, Walker, you got them halters? Yeah, I got one right here. - Here you go. - Thanks. He kinda looked like her, but I don't know. What was his last name? She doesn't know his last name. - What you doin'? - Kansas found your daddy. - I didn't say that. - Where's he at? He's at the stockyards. Ida, I said "I think"! Howdy. Howdy, sir. What can I do for ya? Well, if you don't mind me askin'. Does your first name happen to be Walker? Yes, it is. My name's Ida. Ida Clayton. My mama's name is Elaine Clayton. It's a fine name. Well, you see, sir, we're from Dalton, and that's in Oklahoma. But we used to be from Springville, or at least that's where my mama was. I wasn't actually born on account I'm only 12 years old. But that's kind of the point... because she fell in love with a rodeo man named Walker. I was just thinking that since his name's Walker, and he could be my father. You know. Since your name's Walker, it could be perfect. Your name is Walker, right? That's good. I mean, you're just the right age and everything. I was just wondering... if you could be him. My father. Ida, you seem like a wonderful young lady. But I've never been to Springville. I'm sorry. Wait a minute. They didn't meet in Springville. They met in Kansas City. I'm from Colorado. I'm pretty sure I've never met your mother. I'm sorry to have wasted your time. Hey, babe. Well, what are you doin' here? Well, I was on my way to Missouri... and I passed a sign that said, "You are leaving Kansas." It hit me I'm not ready to leave you. Look, I got a confession to make. I'm not supposed to drink anymore. I'm sorry. I thought you just bein' a big rodeo star and all-- No, it's just I used to be kinda wild. I guess I got what you could call a past... and... I'm different now, but-- Is that okay? Of course it's okay. You know, I got a past too. So what's this past of yours? I went to business school for two years. That is not a past. A past is something bad... like petty theft at least. I dropped out. - All right. That's a little better. - Gettin' there? How come? My parents own this big business... and I was expected to take it over one day. Yeah. When I got there, I just felt like I was penned in. I couldn't breathe. Thought it was my destiny to be out here and think for myself. How about you? - Am I happy? - Yeah. Hopefully the bad times are behind me. Don't I know you from somewhere? Here I thought you did all your hidin' in the hay cart. Oh, come now, angel. Tell old Rawley what's all the fuss. I ain't no angel. Bad day, huh? It's a bad life. Well, I don't know about that. Aren't you one of those Sweethearts? More like one of their stray horses. Mama was right. I'm such a mess. He wouldn't wanna have anything to do with me. Hey. Hey now. Hey. What are we talkin' about? Boy trouble? You just wouldn't understand. You probably right about that. I never been too good at relationships myself. But I will say sometimes it's just as simple... as that boy not even knowing there's a problem. You can't give up. - You gotta get right back in the saddle-- - Wait. - What did you just say? - About giving up? No, no. About "not even knowing." Yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about. - Can I have this? - Well, I-- Well, I'm glad I could be of help. That cowboy helped me see the problem. My daddy probably didn't know I existed. But if I could become a famous trick rider... and get my picture on the front page of the newspaper... then he would find me for sure. The Hippodrome? You want me to teach you the Hippodrome? - Why? - Why? That's right. Why? I can't even get you to practice your drills. Well, you said I had what it takes. Well, maybe you do, but that doesn't mean... I'm gonna teach you a dangerous trick like the Hippodrome. Listen. Did Kansas and Madison ever make the front page doing a Spin the Horn? Not that I know of. Then Hippodrome it is. I hope someday you find your daddy, Ida. I really do. But whether you do or not... you can't go living your life lettin' all those yesterdays define your tomorrows... not if you wanna be a trick rider. You gotta step into that arena with a clear head... and a quiet heart. But you don't start out with the Hippodrome. You gotta learn every piece of it step by step. Fine. Then that's what I'll do. You don't have to get all Mr. Miyagi on me. Come on. Relax. That a girl. Easy. Breathe. Breathe. Good girl. Easy as pie. - Hey. - Hey. Any news on the sponsor front? You know. "We'd sure love to, Miss Parker, just as soon as this economy picks back up." I heard there's gonna be a big honcho from the Cactus Saddlery here tonight. - Really? - Word is they lookin'. They'd be great. I know you been praying, Augustus. We all have. But I'm not sure it's doing any good. I mean, every time we get close to it... it seems like someone just snatches it away from us. If God is driving our car... then honestly, it seems to me... he took a wrong turn a few miles back, or I-- Okay. I know you believe, Rebecca... but believin' and trustin' is two different things. So you think all my second-guessin' makes me a fool? Just means you've been given a chance to find out what trust really means. Thank you. I am ready to practice more of my Hippodrome. - You don't say. - Well, yes, sir. I mean, I've had my fill of "waxin' on and waxin' off." Well, how about we start on it tomorrow, okay? All right, ladies, listen up. We gotta look extra sharp tonight. There's gonna be some potential sponsors in the audience. Hey, that's good, ain't it? Good. Yeah, that means we can finally go legit. Hey, where's Kansas? I'm just wondering, is this-- Is this just for fun, or what? Well, I mean, it's fun, but... I think there's somethin' more. Me too. Bye. Come on. Rebecca. I told you not to see that cowboy. Rebecca, it's not a big deal. It's not? I'm 21 years old. I should be able to have a boyfriend. You can see him all you want when we're back home. But you know the rules about fraternizin' with boys when we're on the road. I'm not fraternizing with him. I need you to be focused on the job that you are here to do. I am focused. Kansas, you see that boy again while we're out here... you can say good-bye to the Sweethearts! Well, you know what? That's fine by me. 'Cause I would choose love over trick riding any day. What are y'all starin' at? Tend to your horses! - Howdy, Ida. - Hi, sir. Can you imagine it, Prince? Everyone just watching you and me? Ladies and gentlemen and worldwide audience watchin' at home... please help me in welcomin' at only 12 years old... the greatest trick rider in the world... Miss Ida Clayton! See, Ida Clayton rides for many reasons. But tonight, she rides in honor of her daddy... who doesn't even know that she exists. She was born to Elaine Clayton of Dalton, Oklahoma... and a mysterious cowboy named Walker. Ida's the youngest to perform the death-defyin' Hippodrome... in competition! Hey, kid! What were you thinkin', pullin' a stunt like that out here? - Come on. Let's see. - My arm. - You all right? - No. It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna go get you set down here. How bad is she? Well, she's a little banged up, but I think she'll be all right. She's definitely not riding for a few days. - Thanks for all your help. - Well, no problem. Hey. Take care, missy. Thank you. Great. Now we're down two. - Hi. - Don't you "hi" me. You was practicin' the Hippodrome. And I straight up told you not to. I'm sorry. - Hey there, sweetie. - Don't call me sweetie. Didn't mean anything by it. I'm Mark Winters, Cactus Saddlery. I'm looking for the Sweethearts of the Rodeo. You'd best steer clear of the Sweethearts. - Excuse me? - They only care about themselves. - Is that so? - Yep. You'd be wasting your time, as far as I'm concerned. And who would you be? I used to be one of their riders. Have a nice day. But I almost had it! The trouble with you, Ida, is you just don't listen. What? Those men from the saddle company that were comin' tonight... aren't. What? Did Miss Grumpypants over here say somethin' to them? No. Kansas did. - This was our big break. - Then why did you go and hurt your arm? It wasn't my fault I went and hurt my arm. Dang it, Ida. Whose fault was it then, the horse? Fine. I'm sorry. Well, you know what I'm really sorry about? Is that they ever let Kansas out of jail. Ida, hush. Kansas was there for you when no one else was. Girl, you gotta stop worrying about other people's problems... and take a long, hard look at yourself. Maybe you could call 'em up and explain everything? I don't have their number. Terence! - Dad! - Terence! Dad! Augustus, call 911. It's all right. It's all right. He's gonna be fine. Come on. He's gonna be all right. Rebecca pulled everyone from the show. There was no way we were performing that night. There was one more show scheduled at home... but without Terence, it was lookin' like the Sweethearts were done. But he'll be okay? Well, Mr. Parker has stage two. It is treatable, but he has a long road ahead. - Thank you. - Thank you, Doctor. It's okay. - It's all right. - All right. It's gonna be all right. You can't let him see you like this. Hey. Doctor said Terence needs to rest. What if your mama's cooked up a big feast to welcome you home... and you're sittin' here missin' it? She doesn't cook. Hey, what are you doing? What's it look like I'm doing? My arm feels better. Don't think your mama didn't miss you. I promise you. She has. And I promise you she's probably just sittin' there... waitin' for you to come home. Thanks, Madison. All right. Go on now. You have fun with your mama. Madison was right. Stop tryin' to replace my daddy! Stop! How you feeling? Well, you just rest, Mr. Parker. Come on, boy. - She ran away. - What? - Prince is gone too. - We better try and find her. She looks like an angel, doesn't she? You'd have been proud of her out there on the road, Elaine. She's a real trouper... just like you were when you were her age. Really? I sure am sorry I lost track of you after your daddy passed. But I'm real grateful Ida's brought us all back together. Me too. Now, this lovely lady here is Nurse Joan... and she's gonna bust me out of here for that last rodeo tomorrow night. I'm gonna appeal to her sense of adventure. Would you mind passing me that box over there on the way out? Bless your heart. I found this up in the attic a little while ago. No idea how long it's been there. It can wait. I think your little girl needs to go home. Yeah. All right. Take care. You too. Is that you? You have your grandfather's eyes. I have your eyes. You have my stubbornness. You really miss him, don't you? Yeah. - I'm real-- - I like those-- No. It's okay. Go ahead. Those curtains in my room are real pretty. I'm glad you like 'em. I wasn't sure whether to put 'em up now... or wait till after your show tomorrow night. I'm not gonna ride tomorrow. What? I'm retiring. No, honey, I'm not asking you to. I know. But-- All I ever do is talk, Mama. When words come cheap... sometimes you just gotta find another way to say what you really mean. I missed you. What time is it? I wanted to show you the morning paper, see if I could get you to reconsider. Terence isn't even gonna be there. Besides, I'm sure they'd do far better without me. I'm just gonna go back to sleep, okay? - All right. - Love you. Mom! You are not gettin' away from us that easy. Did you think we wouldn't miss you? We're draggin' you out whether you like it or not. Okay, okay, I'm going! We got a big show tonight, boy, for everyone. Gotta help Mr. Terence. Got the sponsors comin' tonight, huh? That way, the Sweethearts can keep ridin'. We've been through a lot together. Thank you for being there for me. Good boy. - Hi. - Hi, Ida. I'm really sorry about the other night. You seem like a really nice man, Mr. Rawley. You can date my mama if you want to. I'm sure she'd be happy. No, I-- Ida, I didn't come here to date your ma. Ida, I came here... to ask permission... to introduce myself to my little girl. Why do you need permission to-- People call me Rawley. Rawley West. But my real name is Walker. And I don't know why it didn't work out between me and your mom. I'm sure it's my fault. I was more bullheaded than the bulls I rode back then. I didn't know about you, Ida. And when I saw your confidence and your determination, it... convicted me, and... I can't get those beautiful brown eyes out of my head. Hey, you know-- You know what the difference is between a cowgirl and an angel? What? Angels can't ride as good. Oh, sweet little girl. Yeah. I'm here now, Ida. I'm here now. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to rodeo night in Clarksville. The Sweethearts of the Rodeo... are a very special set of ladies I'm gonna introduce you to in a moment. They ride with a purpose. And tonight, they ride for a gentleman. He dazzled us with his riding, and we wanna take care of that gentleman. And the Sweethearts of the Rodeo wanna make sure... that he knows he's not going through it alone. Ladies and gentlemen, help me and the Sweethearts... and welcome Mr. Terence Parker. - Did they just say "welcome"? - You mean that old coot is here? - Dad? - Guys, come on! Come on! There he is! Terence! Oh, my gosh! He's gonna see us perform! We got a show to do. Come on. He's gonna see us ride. Well, that means he's feelin' better. That's all that matters. Kansas! - What are you doing here? - Look at you. I know. I heard y'all could use another rider. - Got my message. - Yeah, I did. - Well, can we go ridin' now? - Yeah. - Mr. Parker's here. - He's here? - He's out of the hospital. - Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, here they are for your enjoyment... your cowgirls, your angels... your Sweethearts of the Rodeo! And now, ladies and gentlemen, a very special moment for us this evening. Last, but certainly not least... Ida Clayton will perform a surprise for the man... who believed in her when she didn't believe in herself. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Ida Clayton! - All right, Ida, you can do it! - Yeah, come on, Ida! Terence, Ida wants you to know this one's for you. Yeah. Yeah. Whoo! Come on, girl. Come on now. That's my girl! That's my girl! Wow! Look at that! I guess you're wondering how everything else turned out. Well, Terence ended up being just fine. Said he had at least another hundred years or so in those boots. Congratulations. Kansas and her cowboy were truly meant to be. Rebecca said that from now on... true love would always trump rules and regulations. - Rebecca, this is Justin. - I know who he is. Come here. Welcome. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. The man from the saddle company was mighty impressed by the show... and very excited about striking a sponsorship deal... to keep the Sweethearts of the Rodeo riding for years to come. As for my mama and daddy... I don't claim to know what the future will bring. But I'm hoping the spark that once burned so brightly between them... just might rekindle itself. And as for me... well, I sure learned how to fall... but I do believe that I also learned how to fly. After all, I had gone searchin'for my daddy... but did one better. I found myself. Yep, it was like the good Lord himself was smilin'down on all of his cowgirls. Of course, the only difference between cowgirls and angels... my daddy once told me... is that angels just can't ride as good. English
