PRESENTS: IN: PROVINCIAL ACTORS Written by: Directed by: Photographed by: Music by: - Krzysztof, you off to the rehearsal? Have you had breakfast? - Yes. - So go. What about lunch? - In our bar? Half past two. Good morning. Is there fresh bread in the corner shop? Yes, night baked. And at the butcher's? I haven't looked, I don't know... Check the oil level and clean the spark plugs. - Boss, I have no time. - The rehearsal is in two hours. Everybody laughs but they are wrong. - Nice weather, isn't it. - Yes, it is. He got crazy in his old years. It's summer and he wants to stage a national drama. You know when we should play 'Liberation'? In Autumn. And now 'Fasio's Wedding' and that's it. I don't envy you. You will slave and I will wait. - Morning. - Hello. Is the cast list hanging? I've always dreamt to play the Old Actor. But I will play Karmazyn. If you are Karmazyn, I am Holysz. Just first act - and then home. - No, to a side job. Fashion show. - That's life. Danka, do you know the cast? Krzysiu is Konrad, Andrzej is Father, you are a Mask, and you are Karmazyn. Haven't I told you? Danusia, why isn't the list hanging? - Do I sit in the manager's office? - I'm sorry. - No. She lies in the office. - Good morning. See you around. Oh, you mysteriuos beauty, let me call you Literature, whoever you are, Muse. - A gifted boy. - What have you learnt it for? We did fragments at school, I couldn't understand, but I was so emotional that all female teachers enthused. - You had a deep personality, dear. - I still do! Of course. Andrzej, why so worn out? Colleagues! Zygmunt, please! Today we start rehearsing for one of the most important plays in Polish literature, for Polish theatre. It will require extreme concentration and work, but our troupe has proved that we are able to work hard and each of us can cross the limits of their own selfishness. I believe it will happen again with 'Liberation'. This work of this great Polish visionary, won't leave any of us indifferent. In everyday work and troubles we sometimes cannot continuously keep in our hearts this feeling that great matters, written with the capitals: Homeland, Human Fate, Freedom, Art are as crucial as bread and shoes. I talk about it because we start rehearsals for and exceptional play. I'd like to introduce you the director, Mr Slrawomir Szczepan, with whom you will struggle through this labirynth of symbols and interpretation options. Over to you. - What's happened? - But at twelve... Yes, I'm sorry, me and my colleagues Antczak and Bielski have a meeeting at twelve in the Culture Departament. Could we leave after the break? - If it's necessary... - Thank you. Have I told you the manager from Lodz is coming? What for? To see me. When? Don't know. I've sent him an invitation for the opening night. You know, I am in the cast. I have a good role. Krzysio, in this theatre there are two real actors: ...you and me. And this role... - You will play it great. - Have drink with me. Sorry, we have an anniversary... Yes, for the anniversary, have a drink with me. - In a moment. - OK, I'll be waiting. What's happened? You have no idea what's going on. I'm playing Konrad in 'Liberation'. This is more than I could imagine. Something starts happening. It must be the turning point. - And what is the director like? - Young, clever. From Warsaw? Finally - not one of these provincial routininsts. Difficult to say after first rehearsal, I need to talk to him. - What is it? - Nothing. Sit there in corners and sidelines and I will call you to stand up. - Whatever you tell. - You will do what you do every night. - And we get the ordinary pay? - And ordinary pay you will get. - I don't know. - You will build and destroy. Our sons will demolish our work, we demolish the work of our fathers. You will build and destroy in silence. This is who we are. - This is how I see you and what you will be. - You will see us. - Now rest and wait for the sign. - Who will give it? A streak of darkness will descend. - Darkenss is kind and gentle. - Night is longed for. Night will come after your deeds. Thank you, that's enough, this is simple. - Excuse me, one question. - Yes, please? Who are they? Working class? Or just theatre technicians? Is Konrad an intellectualist who has nothing to offer the working class? This issue does not come back, later. Does he, an artist want to create theatre with them? Or a revolution? Excuse me, director. About the allusions: we should make the story simple. Yes, Michal, I think we should remove the flat allusions and scorn. I don't mean allusions. Krzysztof, I see your doubts, my vision is: you come from the light - strong light on your back, darkness around; you have normal working helmets and they reflect the light. You are right, it can be both ways. It isn't explicit. Yes. But we can't do... neither this nor that, Excuse me, I've got lost but I think of analysis... You just play the Stagehands, technicians! - Only? - Yes, only them. Why ,,only”? This is great, for example Swinarski did it. What about the night? Night will come after your deeds. And they are just Stagehands? The ,,night” is written in capitalics. I think it's about the night that comes after fullfilment. Or after the defeat of revolution or deeds. We should discuss it. And Zygmunt's lines. Our sons will demolish our work, we demolish the work of our fathers. It's not about dismantling decorations. - Are you in my cast? - No, I've brought the chairs. He is a stagehand in our theatre. So, you've brought the chairs, nobody's told you to stay. Good bye. I'm sorry. I think it's clear about the night. Page 16, cross it out from second verse to the end. Tell it to the prompter, by the way she should be here. I don't know why she hasn't come. - Fewer lines, less work. - That's it. What Andrzej said about "our sons" - it's better to avoid the doubt, let's omit it. All right? I am glad we have it cleared. Let's have a break, thank you. Excuse me, one of my colleagues would like to leave after the break. Impossible, no way. Wait a second. So what's left of this scene? Go, if you have to. You are paid to be here until 2 p.m. The pay is rubbish. Can't he do this scene without me? Seems he can't. This play will be a piece of shit anyway. I need money, I have children and home. I won't come, I don't care.. Zygmunt, you were in the payrise committee? Yes. Congratulations. Well, you are all the same. We are entitled to a 3 month notice, right? Yes. So look for some other Muse, I'm handing my notice. Why talking to me? Am I the manager? What do you want? One leaves the rehearsal, another hands her notice. I will wait until the votings - and good bye! You will resign? And who will go with your family for free holidays to Yugoslavia? You've said before he deserved this trip, beacuse he works like a horse. What do you want? A payrise! I don't moonlight like you. You crazy or what? Got a payrise? Everybody has. What a stupid democracy. Payrise should be for what you do. Each duffer will get the top pay just before they retire! That's right. Rises should be for achievements. What are you doing here? A prompter should be at the rehearsal and not in the dressing room. I'm sorry I am a human and I can go to pee. Since when is there a toilet in Hanka's dressing room? And you don't complain. Here we have audience for 8 plays, for the rest we shepherd children and soldiers. Like audience like play. It's not an answer. Theatres play for kids everywhere. Not as much as here. May something happen with this barrack. We pray, our Lord. And with the management. We pray, our Lord. May the Cynic stop smoking. We pray our lord. And may I always smoke. He prays, our lord. And may I play in a good theatre once in a lifetime. What a catch. Who goes for a drink? What, nobody goes to our bar? To hell with you. Our drunkard couldn't wait to get to the spirit. You steal the cigs and I smoke. What? I checked after the second act, there were 9, and now 6. I saw who went in and smoked. We will talk tomorrow! You've told him off! - See you. - Bye. He socked it! Everybody will forget in a few days. What is it? Let's go. Nothing... I called Hanka, she gave me a doctor's phone number. He cured her dogs. And... you see. I know what you're thinking but how could I know she would jump? Of course. I will bring a new cat, we have one in the theatre. I don't want a cat. If I cannot care for animals. I shouldn't keep them. Skawek, I know we've had a talk, but just two words. No. - How about tomorrow? - I'm going to Warsaw. - Can we talk? - Please, go on. I'd like to take exams to drama schol. What you need it for? How come? And you? I look at you and I like this job. Better than yours? Better. More interesting. And you can say something wise... Would you give me a few lessons? I would pay you, I have some money. If I wanted to help you, Adam, I would do it for free. - How old are you? - I'm 27. There is the age limit, they won't let you take the exam. - What is the limit? - 23. So what can I do? I play etiudes, I can show you one, a dancing bear. On hot steel. Give him here! Good job! Go on! Oh, God. I know I am bothering you, but if we decided on such text, we can't waste the chance. We must concentrate on the truth. It's one of the plays really worth doing in one's life. We must know what we want to say and what for. And to whom. You must trust me. It's difficult even to trust oneself... Yes, I trust you, but the crossings... I can't see the sense. You want to throw half of the masks. There must be shorts, you will not keep on the stage for 4 hours. But what shorts? I understand your vision but the question is: what is it about? It means something, here and now. We must play the text. What text? Is it to be a comedy about theatre? About politics? The title is "Liberation", isn't it? That's right. Excuse me. In your play - in our play - what is this "Liberation" from? You get histerical with no reason. Your role will be great. There are two days off, take your wife to country without a text copy and play tennis. Bye. Krzysztof! Why this thrashing? "Liberation" this time? Come on. Where? To the park. It's after two. - You may not come back. - What have you said? I have enough. Enough. What is it for? Who cares? Who do you want to cheat? Yourself? You think it will be different with "Liberation"? We must do something that would depend on us. So many things happen that do not depend on anybody. Idiot. You speak only in quotations, you overenthuse. But you are a coward! Cold and selfish! Look at me. Look. I do. Help me. And nobody will manage to tie my soul, I've set example, before I knew it myself. They can stamp me with their seals. Put their hands in my pockets. They can tie me, they can steal... Sorry, here you are. It's six a.m. Today in north east and partly central Poland the day will be cloudy. - Good morning, Tadeusz. - Morning! What time is it? One past six. My radio is broken... I can take it to the service. Don't bother, it's old. Why up so early? Up already or up all night? Up all night. - Good bye. - Regards to your wife! - Thank you. - I really like her. But, how is "Liberation"? Feel invited to the opening night. - Slawek, I think it's all right. - I feel very good, so loose. Stand on the chair. Take the gloves. No, on your feet, really. Director, I am sorry, should my Muse look pregnant? The literature lady, pregnant with meanings. But I should look beautiful! It's a beautiful costume. The spurs. - On my hands? - No! To your shoes! Excuse me, director, should I be dressed like that? With this belly? A moody actress... I'm sorry...! - Great, fantastic. Any questions? - No. Try the mask. Here. Very good. Should I wear it all the time? No, only in the Mask scene. So maybe I will wear a shooting target? - Yes! - Good idea. Please, note: a shooting target. Paint it on. - You feeling unwell? - No. Is that all? - Yes. - Thank you. Now I am being serious, a Muse should be beautiful. - It's very good. - But should she or not? You look great, why should I lie? Jesus... Krzysztof? What's happened? Nothing. - You feel bad? - No. So what's wrong? Something at the theatre? Stop treating me like a child! If maternal instincts bother you, have a baby and let me be. It's not my fault you spoil your role. Listen what clever books my wife reads: A human emerges from nothingness, thrown amongst his possibilities, his arrival is accidental, absurd. Two: Projection. A human chases the possibilities but he does it in vain, towards something that does not exist yet because we are surrounded by nothingness. Our future is in nothingness, our projections give the world some sense, thanks to a human being that has no sense himself. Don't you think it can do her some harm? A puppet theatre star should not read such things. To play scarecrows and rabitts and read Heidegger? She can end up with schisophrenia. No, she's sitting here. Yes, we're in our little home. Two females ond one male calf. The 4 years old cow, Gila, and her offspring feel good. A hundred years live with us, birthday girl. Once more, just once more, live here, live with us. Live here with us! Let the best luck star Never cease on her! Krzysztof, you are ambitious and intelligent, - ...you will achieve a lot. - Don't exaggerate. Remember my words, don't be so modest. Come on. We will all boast that we know you. Right? Of course. Krzysio, for Konrad. Could have been good but it isn't. I know. But it will be. When I see your rehearsals, I pity you so much! And you know he will not work here any more? Really? Too modern. He told me he made a play in some theatre and... What does it mean: too modern? It's a question of honesty. If you don't know what you are doing, you should be brave enough to admit it. If it does not make sense, why do you agree to work? You should rebel. What can we do? We are actors, we have to play. We are artists, our place is in the buffet. Darek, don't drink so much, the rehearsal is tomorrow, you come on the stage again. Watch yourself. And how everyone creeps to him. Mostly Danka. "Oh, director, really, it will beautiful". Who can't play has to creep. Who can play in this theatre? Don't listen, young colleague. Thanks God there are five or six good people. But they haven't been lucky. And they struggle in some backwaters. You must help your luck. If you want something..., ...you can have it. But you need to risk. Leave it all. Go looking. If you really want. Especially you risk, playing with the dolls on sticks. - Leave me alone. - To the ladies! Yes, Women's Day, socialism, democracy, a Degree in Art... But without a man in the theatre, a woman achieves nothing, despite her talent. You exaggerate. Do you think our actresses would play the great roles without their husbands - managers and directors? You have no idea what it is to be a woman in the theatre! 19th century. Not only in the theatre it's better to be a man. Jesus Christ, Malinka! What a lovely blouse you're wearing! - You've startled me. - Where did you get it? It's old, I sew in a piece of lace. - Lovely! Ania, have a look! - Yes, really nice. My dear, when I was young, I wore lovely things. Men were crazy about you, didn't they? I was always nervous but original. And they noticed me. One was crying when my mummy refused him my hand. Your health. And one wanted to kidnap me. But they all bored me, only Kazimierz, Kazimierz... We called him Asian. Kazimierz was then Asian. His nickname was also "Wild". Oh, it seems he's back. He's not, lucky him. Malinka, have you got Spaniards in your family? - No, Italians. - I thought so. Asian has scratch marks. I wouldn't repay him for my trouble even if I hit him with a hammer. You have enough time. Now he listens to me. When he's got crippled. You know what I did to him once? I tore out his hair, made a bald spot. I went for a hair set, our Jadzia had a salon. She was doing my hair and said: "Malinka, dear, you have... ...alopecia areata“. "Oh, God, not alopecia areata!" I was scared, ran to the doctor. He looks at me, doesn't say anything. He says: "It's not alopecia, these are mechanical damages"! "My II And then I remembered my dear Asian did it during his last jealousy attack. I thought I would die of shame. And I said; "Wait, you bastard, I'll show you". I jumped to him and said: "Have that!" I'm sorry, dear. And he got scared. He spilled tea on his trousers. The revenge feels sweet! Love is a gypsy child... Krzysio, don't look at me like that. Come on... Malinka, come to bed. To get drunk like that... Ania, have you got something for nerves? - No, what for? - Yes, I have. - What do you have? - Valium. That's weak. But will do. Only Andrzej was patient enough for Malinka, but he gave up. You know this queer also loves him? - Who loves whom? - Andrzej loves Krzysio. - A new phase of delirium? - Everybody says that. Darek, drink more, you might say something interesting. I will. In his youth he was some writer's secretary. What was his name? I don't remember, doesn't matter. Andrzej is a good guy, but queer. A pity he is a lousy artist. You know, I'll whack you. He will laugh in a minute. Krzysio! Excuse me, have the guests gone? Kazimierz, you can come in, Malina has gone to bed. Thank you. Malinka, how are you? Headache! My daddy always said: "Little bird, you are too good". My beloved daddy. People, why so little beauty! To my wife! New? Yes. Nice? Very nice. Turn the light off. What's up? Adam, why carrying alone? Can't others help you? - I will manage. - I can't disturb him. Enthusiast, likes hard work. Ardent ones are the worst kind. Want to work, but do nothing well. We've made decorations for a school celebration. Adaé wanted to do this. You know what he did? Hang the eagle upside down. The courtain went up, the boss saw it and would do a head stand himself. But he's a good guy, isn't he? Yes. Don't you pereform at celebrations? - It's well paid. - I'm not good at it. Once I took such hackwork and made a fool of myself. Yes. If you don't have a gift. Zawadzki, do I have to send you a special invitation? Hello. What's happened, Mr Zawadzki? The guys don't want to work at... this play. Why? We had an argument with the director. He called us swines. We've told him a few words as well. This is rubbish, I see it. You walk in gas masks. It's not that bad. We went to the manager, but he did not want to talk. If it wasn't for you, Krzysio, we wouldn't be doing that at all. The foreman would work on his own. Zawadzki, coming or not? To hell with them! Anka? Zarzycka? Krystyna Gazda! You are an actress! You, so good at physics! Hi, hello. - Where did it come from? - I don't know, somehow. Sawicki told me, remember him? The spotted, red hair. Always had his flies open. I know. He told me about you when I met him two years ago. Are his flies OK? He doesn't blush, he's a big fish! What are you doing here? Do you live in Warsaw? I rarely go to the theatre, no time. I have a guest performance with the theatre. So, how can we meet? I have two things to do. - What's the time? - Four. So I would be free at six. And you? I have the play at five. Perhaps I could come for the second act? No, come on... Where are you playing? Really, what for? I don't know if I can find you a ticket. And after the play? - I will be walking... - From where? - From the Palace of Culture. - So I will come here. But after the play I... And where do you live? In Rozbrat, over there. So maybe I would come at half past eight, I'm meeting some friends after the play. They would drive me to your place. OK, so after eight. Bye. But wait, I haven't got your address. - You've got something to write? - Yes. Rozbrat 3 A. I'll be waiting. You look nice. Come on, let go, later. Thank you. So, what do you do? I studied industrial architecture. You build factories? You could say so. - You've stopped skating? - Yes, before final exams. I grew up so fast, I got so big. I had a feeling the skates did not carry me. Lovely wood. After we met I thought, l jumped at you, you could have got startled. In fact we were not close friends. Did not talk much. But I used to look up at you. How come? Yes, I was impressed with your confidence. Don't misunderstand, it was not boasting, but you were just so sure of your opinions. I've told you today I remembered your eyes. - No, you haven't said. - I have. You just don't rememeber. Hello? Is it you? I can't, I have a guest. Who is this lady who connected me? I wouldn't hang up, I don't do that. My ex-husband. In fact, a husband, but we've been separated for a year. Doesn't want to give me a divorce. - More coffee? - No, thank you, this is great. Yes, I like it too. I brought it from Brussels yesterday. So, you're an actress? Let's better talk about you. You've changed a lot. A different person. - How have you achieved it all? - With poison and a dagger. What? Poison and dagger. How to say that? Good luck. Could have gone worse - but went fine. You must have a talent. It's not the most important thing. You must help your talent. And it wasn't so good at the beginning. One day I said: "I won't give up" - and I managed. Let's talk about you. Are you married? Yes, for ten years. And, how is it? Fine. - An actor? - Yes. What is he like? We love each other. So it's very good, not just "fine". After ten years? Krysia! - Maybe I would... - No, sit back. Krystyna, can we have a word? You idiot. What's going on? It's OK. Calm down. Delicious. Maybe you would eat some? No, thank you. - Please, try, it's really good. - No, no, thanks. What role have you played recently? A crow. What? - Did you caw well? - Yes, I've got an award. - I think I will be going. Excuse me. - Really, can't you stay? No, I can't. Thank you very much. - Perhaps, a bit longer? - I really can't. I must go. Always call me when you are in Warsaw. - Has your coat dried? - Yes, completely. Thank you, good night. Oh, Lord! Goodnight, thank you! Anyone chasing you? How can you eat like that, come on. Yes, I forgot. There are things we don't forget, probably no one told you at home. The way one eats is impulsive. Your father eats the same way. - Haven't noticed. - But I have. You care for nothing but your plate. Did you go hungry as a child? Let me be. Or this open toilet bowl! The lid should be closed. Where do your family traditions come from? Yes, you've got offended. I can't say anything. I'll tidy up, leave it. OK. Whoever lives in Polish land, With covered forehead and your eyes sad, You wring your hands and lament. Oh, come here..., you will revive. You will see the liberation. We come here to announce: tragic our play will be . It will be a reproach and confession. Adas, come. We will play the highest tones like bells ringing from towers. Those will see the Liberation Who are freed with their own will. We scowl a hundred years in ties. What do you say? The world sneers at us. Can't even dream of better fate. We should... ...crave blood... for our blood! ...crave blood for our blood. The heart aches when we see our sons. Our grandsons give us disgrace. What do you think? In bondage The heads got used to yokes. When will he come? The one who frees us? He will not. False are our dreams! False are our dreams, In ghosts and sorcery we faith. So what is left? Shackles, poison, razors and ties, if you, my brother, despise your fate. Yes, good, let's stop. Malina, let's cross out ,,When will he come, the one who frees us”. Now, rest of the page, but lively, or louder at least. Please. Let's put hands on our chests and listen to the heartbeat. Obedient to what happens around. Fly above... - It was crossed out. - What do you mean? - Have a look. - Where? I said it. Here. Buddy, learn your role, don't play a fool. I don't know my role? Let's make it clear. If I asked for "a word", don't give me full lines! I throw you words, you don't catch. I don't catch? I say each line. - So I am a bad prompter? - Yes, horrible. Don't care for this idiot. Are you crazy? People are working! It's all right. An old actor does not know simple things. The same again! It can only happen in this theatre. Close the door when you talk. Hanka, your "Heavenly, I descend..." is great. Really? I swear, I've listened today. Jureczek. . ., Thank you. I really want to do it well. I have problems breathing but I'll practice. Give me a cigarette. Our plays is getting better and better. The opening night is in 10 days, not 10 weeks. Remember. All right. Not "all right", but think what you are doing! What's going on? Who's next, you? I'm after you. Give me my copy. Hold it! Don't brainwash me. The masks are not there yet. I don't have to make excuses. Let's go. It's not a puppet theatre. Don't change it your own way. - The world is coming to an end. - What's happened? This doesn't make sense. Why are you leaving the stage? Mister Malewski? Can you explain? Take it off! Complain to the director! No, everything is fine. Rabble! Bought it in the market place, but it isn't pure wool. Krzysio, you can't do that. What's happened? - You feeling bad? - I am, but it's irrelevant. The opening night is in ten days... If this is the director's vision... If you use the word ,,vision” once more, I will break the tables and hang myself on the lamp. Krzys, coffee? I don't want anything, I want to scream! This is the end of season, we are all tired. But there is the festival... We must control our nerves. Don't speak to me like to a neurotic girl. Can't you see it has no sense? What is this play about? The director has described his vision. The idea seems controversial. But Szczepan is not a beginner and he is entitled to experiments. Let's stop talking - something might happen to me and we will all regret. - Krzysztof... - It can't be crossed out! What has he crossed? Homeland, Human Fate, Freedom - all crossed out. Mask 11, 15, 8 - crossed out. "You are brawlers!" - crossed out. You are brawlers - have never felt proud, but about poverty, whose despair you jostle with full bellies and servant's fist! You footmen of stranger's vainglory! Yes, you have learnt the role and your effort is wasted. But it happens, it's not your first year here. Manager, but Mask 12, really important, is left. But what's left? Naked ass! Bugger me! ,,Liberation” without the Polish issue? Is it just a play about actors and theatre? Can you explain? Maybe I am stupid? Perhaps you can explain, manager? Maybe the director? - Coffee? - Yes, please. Provincial hardline. What is it? Let's finish. Ladies and gentleman, end of rehearsal. He wouldn't give me a glass of water when I have asthma! When I eat fish, he hopes I choke. God, this is a real actor. To play like him... I forgot to tell you, aunt Brunona sends you regards. I've heard there was a fight at the reahersal. No, everything is fine. You don't have to play. You can resign. Not so easy, when you've done so much. If something has no sense, you should leave it. Ania, make sandwiches. Make sandwiches! Is it an order or a request? Please. Our monarchy must be a bronze rock... Krzysio, and what about Lodz? The manager is going to come. Excuse me. What's going on? Father comes so rarely, could you be a bit nicer? Save your moods for the time we are alone. To hell with your daddy! That's strange, everybody shares my view, but nobody supported me. It's not their fault. Remember the last line from Norm/id's "The Ring of a Great Lady"? "Marvellous fiction". You also haven't said a word. I wonder if you are my friend... or just a queer in love. "Hard to live without love". Where is it from, remember? - Do you mind? - No, you can smoke. Krzysio? Something wrong with Ania. - She's just tired. It will pass. - Will it? Yes, don't worry. Why should I worry? It's your life. That's right. I'd like to tell you something. I think I'll get married. What? I will go home. Go, I will stay and do everything. Krzysio? It's late, time to go home. Excuse me? I've said it's time to go home. Yes. Yes. I've seen a lot, working in the theatre for 30 years. You'll torment yourself to death. I'll be going. Yes, Stasio, I'm sorry I've kept you. I will be fine, thank you. And he's made them too tight again. Give it to me. When will he learn...? - Push, Krzysio! - Pull! The same each time. Bloody boots. The instep is too narrow. We will give it to be fitted. Or he must make a new pair. What is it?! Please, go to the bedroom. I'm really touched with your kindness, just like you are - but go. He won't come. False are our hopes. This is our colleague Malewski - the manager from Lodz. Hello, nice to see you. Good morning. Misha': Sulkiewicz. It's been ages! Why so sad?! I came with the manager. I wanted to see you after the play. I will be home, do you know my address? - No. - Have you met? - We studied in the same year. - It can be seen. 5/11, Weglowa street, will you remember? I will drop by afterwards, ok? See you. Excuse me. Good bye. Nice to meet you. I've read a lot about your theatre. I thought you were younger. I am really curious of the play - and your role. Today is the first dress rehearsal. The director did not object to my staying, besides I have a premiere on Saturday, I wouldn't be able to see you. Couldn't you come after the premiere? I'm sorry... Stagehands, to positions. Don't watch the play today. Please, walk the manager to the seats. See you after the rehearsal. This way, please. Excuse me. Krzysztof? I haven't thought you would stick a knife into me. We don't know anything yet. Sit down, please. Krzysio, I set the whole repertoire for you and you are leaving? It's not fair. Not after what I've done for you. You can't expect I would stay here all my life. You know how I fought for you? Your colleagues objected. You are young, haven't played much, you have low standards, you haven't deserved it. You haven't done any community actions. But you see, I support young talents. I am not that young, I'm 31, besides I think I have always worked well. Have I taken appropriate measures after some incidents? But... I have a file of denouncing letters about you. The Culture Departament receives complaints. But what complaints? To the stage, please. Konrad, please! Get on the stage. Ladies and gentleman, we begin in one minute. Get on the stage! Adorn the national stage. I will see the riches and make the fire burn. Theatre, the temple of art. Put the columns here, and here the monuments. Make them stable, with poles support them. Stagehands, on positions. To build Poland, lords and peasants... Stagehands, change. Muse, give me the tone. Change! What is going on? Change! What is it with you? It's the dress rehersal. Should I send a cab for you? Dress rehearsal! Easy to say: calm down! You will not teach me. - Quiet, little mouse. - You will be in the report. They will torment these people to death. Appear to me! What am I to do? I can hear this question. I've always heard what you were thinking. I am to carry out the destiny, theirs and mine. Steal the holy fire that burns. Steal? Take the holy fire and give it. Give? To those who are waiting. The bell! No, manager, I won't control them by myself. The dress rehearsal and your Stagehands all drunk. Majchrzak, I am not drunk, I will breath out. To hell with your breathing. So write a report. It's not enough. - I will throw you out. - I didn't drink! Hold. It was a good one with this bell. But you pulled very well. Krzysiu, will you come to our bar? - Yes, later. - In a moment. See you. We will talk about details, when you come. And is this Malewski a gifted guy? He is, but insubordinate and drinks too much. I see. If you could call me again. Thank you. Manager! - It's you, I thought you have left. - Let's go to the buffet. Well, Krzysztof - I am honest talking to actors. You are gifted, but you have some shortcomings. I imagined you were a different kind of person. I need talented actors, but even more I need useful and reliable actors. I don't see you in the repertoire for next year. This is El Dorado, a virgin land. There is no life in Lodz, drained area, I've done Majakowski 300 times. Here they buy everything. Do you have any contacts in Culture Centres around? Not really. The Chemist's Centre is like a gold mine, I will come three times a month. - We will be really pleased. - Me too. If you are loosers, it's your problem. Your health. You can make your living here, how long have you been working? Eight. How many a month? With roadshows, there will be 20. God, the standard is 10, but it's good if I have 6. I don't make enough for a baby sitter. If it wasn't for singing and film, I would go back to my mummy. I have friends, they can always find something, - Krzysio, introduce us. - ...like an episode in film. Misha': Sulkiewicz, Marek As. It's better to play an episode than a role. When you come, I will help you, you will pay me back with a few cognacs. - I will find you a dubbing. - I don't know if I move. Stop it, the theatre is lousy, but you will have some side jobs. The theatre is not good? Of course, but not worse than others. Ala, I will pay tomorrow! The boss can make them write good reviews. Krzysio, just a word. But if you want great Art... No chance. Guys leave us and try producing. Then they complain and come back. And then again. Krzysio, just a word. There isn't much to play, but it's quite a big city. - What's happened? - Nothing, lend me 50. - 50. Please. - Go home. But I'm hungry. Krzysio, just lend me 50. I am really starving, don't you believe? - Here. - Thank you, Krzysio. Ala... Listen. I'd like something better. Everybody would. Your health. One more. Are you still with that... Ania? A nice girl, give her my regards. Has she got the degree? Plays with dolls on sticks. Puppet externist. She frolics with dolls. A bright girl. Why did they expel her? Lack of predisposition. Emotional. For acting profession. Bastards. They destroy people. I must go, Krzysio. Bye. - That soon? - I have a train to catch. See you in Lodz. I went to Honoratka, to Mrs Sokdrowska. To talk. And there was a dog under the table. Jumped out and bit me. Here. My hand, when I fought back. And dogs are not allowed in the cafe. And my leg. This dog had no muzzle! The young man is leaving. Pulls the dog and goes. I go after him and call the policeman. He knew the policeman and they gave me a 100 zloties fine. That I scream. I had to, the policeman did not want to give me the man's details. What if the dog was ill? I can't get ill, I live alone. But it is is not the point. Ubi lex, ibi pena. They don't teach you latin now, do they? Horrible people. I lost my marbles a bit after all this. Luckily my wife hasn't lived to see it. Tadeusz, do not worry, I will take care of it. Does not matter. Time to understand. Everybody can offend an old man. Go down, sun, if the time has come, My legs hurt to walk the field. My legs hurt to walk My hands hurt to work Go down, sun, if the time has come. If you, my sun, had to work like me... Jesus! What's happened? - No! - What's happened? - No! - Go home! Have you seen? O, Lord! I stood at the window to shake my skirt out and someone fell. I looked down. It was the neighbour. - Which neighbour? - From fourth floor. Tadeusz, the elderly man. I recognized him. Jesus, how he crashed. Dead on the spot, for sure. I saw him falling. Just in front of me, had I leaned out, he would have killed me! Have you seen? It's better you haven't, I you saw him... I felt as if a thunder struck me. Why did he do it? Disperse, please! Oh, God, Muszka, dog. I left the door wide open. Why has he done it? Look away! - Hurry up. - I'm not going. As you wish. Don't touch. Can't you see he's dead? We must go. I forgot to invite him for the opening night. Doesn't matter now. Krzysio, let them say whatever they wish, I liked it. I have a request. Could I have my trip expenses reimbursed? Great, just great! If not now, do it in the morning, all right? Of course. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Is there everybody? Sit down. Our Muse isn't here. Haneczka, please. Give her the seat. - Manager, thank you, but no. - Haneczka, please, come! - I'm sorry. - Here you are. We haven't met. Hanna Wbdarczyk. Dear colleagues, I'd like to thank you for the effort you've put into our performance. They want to make another cut tomorrow: the moment Konrad appears. You want to behead me? The director will cross out three or four lines again. You want to have jewellery fixed by a carpenter? The director gave us a beautiful play. Thank you very much. What a kiss. Once again, regardless how much effort you've put - thank you. Good evening, excuse me. Thank you. - Have you watched? - Yes, I have. And what, another success? Well, it's been average. But you've had some very good moments. In the scene 9 or 10, you were great. If you could only continue... And he will give me a bollocking. Krzysio, you've complained and everything is fine. - You think so? - Of course. - The artist isn't happy again? - He's scared he won't be the best. Whoever fights, might be scared. I'd like to introduce you the editor Gbsowicz. The Head of Culture Departament. Excuse me. Is he glad? I think so. We really need his review now. You don't have to worry. You can count on Gmsowicz and for me. Thank you. Rysia, excuse me. Call and confirm the cab for the editor... - You won't get there! - Told you I would! Good evening. Can I? Manager, could I have a word? Excuse me, can we dance? The premiere was nice. Mr Majchrzak, I've told you to watch your people. This is a banquet for the actors. Manager, we have fired him. He's come drunk from the town. I caught his jacket, but... If you were so kind and left... Manager, you fire me? Why? But I... would do everything for this theatre. With all my heart. Please, I can do everything. Manager, why? Please, please! Stop making a fool of yourself. Adam, I'd like a word with you. Let's go. I'm sorry for this incident. No, I will go to work, not here. Stupid prick! Adam, what's up?! Mr Zawadzki, take care of him. Quiet, he's drunk. He will sleep a bit and go home. Let's have a drink, Krzysio. - Just a shot! - No, thank you. Are you refusing? Today was the opening night, congratulations, Krzysio. To you. Mr Majchrzak, why did you sack him, he was the best guy. Yes, but he caused trouble. You know, he wanted to do good. Krzysio, I will tell you something. Those that want good are the worst. The point is to listen and do what you are told. What do you expect? That you will win if you say a piece of text I have crossed out? Would it change anything? No. Nothing. That's true. If I were the manager, I would fire you. Thanks God nobody noticed. I don't want to make fuss. You know why? Because I like you. I swear to God. You are a jerk, I like jerks. If you want, say this monologue, I don't care. You think I'm a pillock. I am not. In fact, we want the same, don't we? We are the same age. But you act as frustrated petit borgueois. And I have responsibilities. If the play is good, you do well, I do well. And then we can make another play. Understand? We will stupefy them! You don't believe? You think I have no character? I have. Only I know when I can be a creep and when I have to creep. You do the same - but you don't know it. Yes. Krzysio! The reviews will be marvellous. Don't worry. I have thought to show the borderline between acting and privacy, especially in the first act. But I don't know if it was clear... You see? What did they write about me? Talented, great creation. And now? To play, you must be in cahoots with the manager. Andrzej told me you really support him. I have been to all his opening nights. Just once, in Kalisz, when I had pneumonia. Was it clear? I'm not working now, you must ask the director. - Will you have some vodka? - No, thank you. I Will. I wonder why he doesn't play bigger roles. He is so talented. I have talked with Kowalczyk from Warsaw to take him. I can't live by myself. Mummy, you don't have to. But they say I am manager's whore! You know what they say about me? The same - that I am the director's whore. No, they don't. How come they don't? Excuse me, do you remember me? I don't know. In 1964 I was a Wawiejski's secretary. You used to come there... Yes, I did, but I don't remember. You used to be a young student then. I don't remember. I had my cigarettes here! Excuse me. Where are my Kents? Manager, your actor has stolen my cigarettes. - You have them here. - Where? - Here. - Yes. I'm sorry. No vodka. I won't stand it! Manager, we have no vodka. - Don't worry, wait a minute. - You see! Rysia! It's Daniela. Daniela. Can I have a word. - I've asked for a car to the hotel. - It's a 10 minute walk. I won't walk now. They promised me a car. He drove for you to Warsaw and back. He is asleep now. So wake him up. What are you doing? Cleaning at 3 a.m.? Ania? What are you doing? Everything is always different... than you have imagined. I used to think about such moment and... You've imagined it? Yes, but I did not believe. Do you have a feeling it is just a dream? Yes... Yes. Yes. We have destroyed something good. Yes. We've done it together. Thank you. It's kind of you to say that. I've understood, I really think so. I've rented a flat, I will try to cope by myself. I'm close enough to the bottom to reach it and jump up. I understand. However we try, we won't avoid cliches. Whatever we do now, would be pathetic. We can get tearful, or we can... It will be just the same. Always... Excuse me for a minute. - Can I help? - No, thank you. LIBERATION What is it? What are you doing, Krzysio? Get up! Manager, I must tell you..., - I resign of the role. - But, Krzysio... I will not play Konrad. Go and catch some sleep. Please, we have a festival coming. What you do is harmful for you and us! No festival. We have to do... something... that depends from us. - No, it's not that... - What is he saying? It's from "Liberation". Krzysio, you are tired, please, go to bed. - We will talk in the morning. - Nothing, nothing. Krzysztof, wait a minute. We must substitute him, do you know anybody? No, I don't. - I will fire him. - Listen, but... I won't suffer with him for a year! I will run first to tell your parents how nice you've danced! Go home! I'm running, good bye! Krzysztof, what's happened? What are you doing? You are drunk. Let's go from here. Krzysiu? - What's happened? - It's not fair. It's not all right. Shush, quiet. Calm down. It's not fair. It's not OK. Shush, quiet. I don't care. Now I don't care. I will change my job. I will study medicine. I must go. Ania! Ania! I love you. Basia, replace me for a minute, I will be back. You will see. It will be all right. We will move to some other town. Lodz or... Warsaw. It will be great. I don't want anything or anybody. I don't want any fractions, any ideas. They will fall, they have to. No people, personages - they have to fall. I only wish... in a summer day..., a scorching, summer day..., see ryefields reap under my feat, and hear the sound of sickles jingle, and crickets swoosh and whisper. And, in front of my eyes, corncockle cut among the corns. In a hot day I'd hear and see the good and evil herbs be reaped. And how, from golden, scythed corns the brids fly up to feed.
