Ooh. What kind of whiskey did I drink? What is this place? Are we dreaming? I hope you will adjust to your new home soon. Miss Nan Runglawan. Miss Oil Adchara. Miss Joyce Nantaka. Miss Bam Metanee. And Miss Oom Sasima. Welcome to the World of Life and Death. What life and death? Watch your mouth. I'm just a fan of all of you. Only a perverted one who likes to slash and torture people. Today, I get a crave to kill four pretty and sexy ladies But there are five of us, that means… It means, one of you will be spared. Consider it a bad joke. But four others will be cruelly tortured and killed. How do you pick the one out? Forget about killing me. Better let me go, and we'll be having sex all night. Don't you know how hot I am in bed. Come on, no need for anyone to die here, huh? Jeez, if he had wanted to have sex with us, he would have raped us already. We wouldn't be hanging around like this. Or, has he done us already? I'm feeling strange down there all of the sudden. Ha… rest assured. I don't want to have sex with any of you. But it is sex that brought each of you here today. You will be killed to repay the sins you have committed. You have committed the sin of sex, and deserve to be punished without having to wait until the next life. Today is your Judgement Day. What do you plan to do with us? Just tell us exactly what you will do. Each of you will get an equal chance to tell stories about your sex sin to everybody in this room. Whose story I consider most sinful, the teller will be released. What? Shouldn't it be the least sinful to be rewarded? I'm sure to die today. I'm not as experienced in sex as other girls. Don't try to be innocent. Who knows? You might be the worst of us. I'm not like you, Bam. I don't change partner daily like changing tampons. Keep your energy to tell us about your sins. Anyone who tries to make up stories to make it more sinful that it was, there will be sharp metal pricking your body until you return to tell the truth. Well, what if we don't want to tell? Who would you kill? Who would you save? How do you judge? Right. What if we all don't tell? What would do you? Good question, Oil. Good. Don't tell. So you all can go straight to hell. I don't have to decide. I'll kill you all. If no one wants to live, so be it. I'll tell. I don't care whether they will tell or not. I'll tell my story. Mine is most sinful. I'll tell mine. Hey, what the hell? You're taking the easy way out. Behaving like the disgusting politician. How could you do this? Right. I was trying to find the way to save us all. You want me to tell? Okay, I'll tell. You ladies listen and weep. With my hundred sex styles, ha ha ha, no one can beat me. I'll be the one who survives. Don't be so confident. Don't think you are the only one with boobs. Other women have different experiences in sex. Theirs could be more adventurous, far more sinful. But I don't think I'll make it out alive. The sin of sex. I can't think of one. It is settled. Everybody gets unlimited time to tell about their sin. I'm the only person who determines whose story is the most sinful. Nan, you want to start, right? My pleasure. Because mine is sure to be the worst. Don't blame me if I win. Ooh. Yeah. Oh. Ah. Good. Ooh. Ow. You're great. Very good. Oh, oh. I'm almost there. Oh, come on. Don't stop. Oh, ah. Don't stop. Ow. Ow. Ow. Whatever show you want, you'll get it. Huh? You saw Nid and the director having sex? Psst… They were really going at it. Right here in the director's office. No shame at all. Ooh. I knew it. There must be some wrongful doing in here. Because lately, the ratings have been dropping like leaves. I can't believe it. In this day and age, there's still someone who uses sex to get promoted. If it were me, I would take pictures to use for blackmailing. Bad people deserved to get treated badly. Come on, don't lower yourself to their level. If you believe in karma, you know their sins will catch up to them soon. What are you all talking about, ladies? I heard you talking about sins and karma. Oh, nothing much, Nid. We were talking about a guest for my show next week. I was thinking about getting someone who has committed sins, and get punished for what she has done, some thing like that. Oh, really? I don't have that kind of experience. I only know about the modern world, how to attract cute guys. Oh, sorry, auntie. The director asked me to give you this memo. / Thank you. Good news. You have been moved to co-host Nan's show. And next week, your show will be moved to four am. to four fifteen. Lots of viewers during that time. Ah… I'm going to faint. God. I'm a ten year veteran. I'm going to faint. Oh my God. Right. I can stay, but my heart doesn't want to. Okay. I'll talk to you later about Mr. Ar. I have to buy something for Rong. It's a surprise for his special day. Okay, talk to you later. Bye. What are you doing here, Nan? Oh, hello, Mr. Director. Do you live around here too? Not really. I come to see my friend. I have an appointment with Mr. Ar this evening. Oh, Mr. Ar, the Big Pocket? Good, Nan. Try to get as much as you can. Good time slots are waiting for you. If you can get a big sponsor like Mr. Ar to sign up, you surely can get the prime time. I'll do the best I can. I'll have to leave. I don't want to waste your time. Oh, don't work too hard, Mr. Director. Take care of your health, goodbye. Surprise, darling. Oh, shit. Nan, Why are you here? Why, oh? This is your surprise. Oh, this is the bitch you told me about? The one you're tired of screwing. Son of a bitch. Asshole. You faggot. Homo. I'll never marry you. You queer loser. Nan. Don't go. Nan. Stop. Nan, don't go. Hey, Nan. Listen to me. It's nothing. He's my friend. He loves to play joke. Don't listen to her,Rong. That impotent bitch. Let's get back to where we were. I was just warming up. Damn it. How can I get back? I'm screwed. Nan is a television host. Everybody in Thailand knows I'm gay now. I've been staying in the closet for years. Good time to come out. Now we have the wedding ring. Love you. Kiss. I was really seeing red. They told me that our sex was so bad that Rong has turned gay. Irrelevant. Your ex-boyfriend has been gay all along. It's just a lame excuse to say that it's because of what you do in bed. But I was totally mad at him, that damn faggot. Golf. Mike. Stop. Come on, Nan. I'll help you relax. I'll teach you what good sex is like. You're making me blush. I can't believe this is the first time you had orgasm. Don't tease me. I was not born a sex machine like you. I also had a gay boyfriend. If it were not for you, I wouldn't have known how it feels like to be in heaven. So, I guess you like it. I told you, sex is a great thing. But we have to know how to use it. If we can manage it, our life will be in good shape. How can I do that? Use sex to gain advantage in our career and business. Our life will be happy. That's all we want. The same way Nid used to get her show over her seniors? Oh, using sex to get promotion is just the tip of the iceberg. Our aim is much higher. How about Mr. Ar? You are about to meet him, right? Make him go crazy over you. Suck him for at least 10-20 million. How would I suck him for that much money? Oh, it's not that difficult. Just use your charm, plus lots of sex. Let's make a plan. You are going to see him today, aren't you? Let's move the appointment from the afternoon to around 8 or 9 pm. He knows what he will be getting, and he will be in your hands. About that 10 million baht contract for my new show, the one we've been discussing. I don't know if you… Umm, I'm sure you're ready to sign now. I'm ready for you, Nan, if you're ready to take a ride with me. The big budget will be yours when you're mine. Oh, but before I can ride with you, I'll have to have your signature first. My rule is, no deal, no riding. I hope you can take this rule. Oh, sure. I can take everything, every hole. Every which way you want. Where's the contract? Here. Just put it in here. Oops, just sign here, then it's done. Just poke it here. Poke it in here. Okay, done. Now it's my turn to take you on a wild ride. That's it? You think this is so sinful? Yeah, using sex for just a little bit of personal gain. But both ended up happy. It's not so sinful. But it's not appropriate to have sex with someone you don't love. I can't do that. Well, innocent girl. You can't do it because you haven't been in Nan's situation. If it were you, you might have committed more perverted sin. You might not think my story is so bad. But what I did was clearly against a main Buddhist precept. Because Mr. Ar was a married man. And his wife was about to give birth. But it's hard to blame you, Nan. You probably didn't know about his wife. Not knowing means not guilty, I think. It's a big sin that she did. She will surely win this. That's laughable. You call this little thing you did a sin? Just tell me your story if you think it's worse. After that night, Mr. Ar's wife learned about his affair. She got into a shock, had a miscarriage, and died with her unborn baby. Nan, didn't you forget to tell about this part? God. This is not true. Blood. Blood. Help. Help. Argh. It hurts. I didn't mean to lie. Argh. Even if she knew, but it's her first mistake. If it were a sin, it wouldn't be so bad. Once a sin is committed, it's a sin whether it's the first or last time. But it's still more sinful than whatever I have done. Nan, what you did might sound serious, but it's partly because you didn't know that it could affect other people. But my story is really a sin, a deliberate sin. Definitely worse than yours. I'm not very confident. Look, my boobs are falling out. Wouldn't they slip off when I dance on the stage? Oh, come on. You fear the nip slip? It's all for the job. You've got to sacrifice. Believe me. The reporters would be in awe to see you in this dress. Then you'll be on the front page of every paper. Oil Adchara. The pretty singer with a new super sexy look Her new hit album tops all charts and is selling like hot cakes. See, what do you have to lose? Right, my smart manager. Let's go. We have a radio interview with DJ Bogey at two. Look at this news. It's disgusting. What is it? Here. Gibso weeps, saying sorry to fans. After her hidden sexy pictures with a guy are released. Look. You call this hidden? It's definitely intended. Look at the camera angle. You can see the face crystal clear. Come on, all celebrities do it now. It's the best way to be in the news. You know, some people even hire the paparazzi. Telling them where and when to get the hidden pictures. Good afternoon, Miss Oil, Miss Nok Nok. Hello. Long time no see. You've been well? I've been great. How about you? I've been okay. So, today we'll talk about your new single. I've seen your new MV. Seems like you've become a lot sexier nowadays. Not like that. It's the company's policy and the theme of the album. I also wanted to … change my look to be a hot and spicy girl. Oh, wow. You are hot. I admit. One more thing, I don't know if I can ask this question. About the rumor that you are a lesbian. You don't have to answer if you're not comfortable. How could it be possible? They're just jealous of me. Nok Nok introduced me to the show business. I owe her a debt of gratitude. She has been taking care of me like my own sister. It's sickening to think that we would do something like that. I insist. It's just a rumor. Oh, Big Daddy. I want to make amends. You're a respected figure in the showbiz. My place? The same place you use to send me flowers. Oh, it's okay. No problem at all. I'm alone tonight anyway. Okay. I'll be waiting for you. See you tonight. Ewww Our final step after changing to the sexy look is to get support from these playboy journalists. You must not fail tonight. Understand? Ooh, Big Daddy. Good evening. Why do you come so early? I'm not ready yet. Is this really you, Oil? I haven't seen you in a long time. You've changed so much. I almost can't remember you. Come on. You better come in. Because out there is not convenient to do, uh, to talk. Of course. I'd like to do the talk. Big Daddy, you want something cold to drink? Beer or whiskey? Oh, I've been trying to eat healthy foods. I'd like some milk instead. Do you have any milk I can suck up? You're teasing me. I don't want to talk to you now. Let me take a bath first. I suddenly felt the heat. Don't you take the shortcut and sleep while I bathe. Okay. Be right back. Let me get one right here. I got you, Big Daddy. Gotta rub one out. Go ahead. Jerk off all you want, you dick head. Hey, shit. That's my tablecloth. Son of a bitch. Ooh. Big Daddy, have you been waiting for long? You look kind of pale. Just a little bit. I got tired of wanking, uh, waiting. So I try to read something. There's nothing fun to read. Let's watch some really exciting video clip. You can't read upside-down like this. You bitch. You're blackmailing me, aren't you? You made this clip, didn't you? Don't try to be smart. I shot this video a minute ago. No way you can deny it. You dykes. You two have been planning this. What do you want? Don't try to be innocent. Do you think I shot this video just for fun? You want money? How much do you want? Come on, Big Daddy. I don't want any money from you. I plan to share this video among my actress friends. The ones you lambasted in your paper. Or, should I share it to the reporters. Oil, please don't do this to me. I didn't mean to. I made a mistake. I'll write good news about you every day. Big pictures. Two stories in the same page, okay? You've made a promise. Be sure to honor it. Only positive news about her. If I've ever seen any negative news in your paper, you'll turn from Big Daddy to Tablecloth Daddy. A promise is a promise. But if you ever let other people see this clip, I'll get you back a hundred times. I'm not going in, the Uncle doesn't like me very much. Don’t forget our plan. If things go smoothly, follow the plan. Camera. Remember, this is for our future. Just do what I asked. I'm going outside. Yes, ma'am. Oh, Oil. Don't you have an appointment with my husband? Yes, ma'am. His secretary asked me to meet him here. He has been looking serious lately. Yeah, that's why I have to go outside. I can't stand him. I'm so sorry for not being able to extend your contract if you don't consider singing country songs. Yeah, it's because I'm old. I'm like an old toy that you can throw away any time. Please, Uncle, only one year extension. Don't cry, Oil. I don't know what to do now. What the hell is it now? Who is making the noise this late? Oh, Bird? What are you doing here. It's late at night. Ka Ki Su Ka Sa He … Aha … Arrrgh… I said Korean. Korean. Not Japanese, you dumbass. Or you want to sing in Latin? You want Latin? You're lucky that I consider what you've done for me. Or else, you would be singing for soldiers in Iraq. You don't like my Japanese style? Hmm… Arirang Arr…rirang Arirang. Arirang Arr…rirang Arirang. You moron. Arirang Arr…rirang Arirang. Sing it for me. Good. Don’t get the words wrong. Good / Ah… you asshole. What did you say? Ah, you son of a bitch. Arirang, Ah… Good. Good. / A bitch Ah…you bastard. Ah, Arirang. Ah, you dumbass. It's Mr. Bird. Just a little misunderstanding. All clear now. Oh, Oil. You look better now. You must understand me. Yes, I understand you now. I am indebted to you and your wife. I think I can try to sing country songs. If that's what it takes for me to be a singer. That's great thinking. Country songs are good songs to sing. If you sing it well, I'll consider extending your contract, album by album. Oh, okay. Let's see. Oh, right here. Have some drink. Let's have a toast. Young Oolong tea number 5 that you like. Let's drink to that. Hmm… That's good. Drink it. No, if you respect me, you must drink. Good. We must understand each other to work it out. Okay, I'll have to pick up my wife. Okay. Let's get out of here. These are the sins of sex I have committed. Being a lesbian. Using sex to blackmail other people. Using sex for personal gain. Oh, then I'm a lesbian too. I had sex with a woman, plus too men. You're not a lesbian. You just had an experience. That's not a sin. Actually, being a lesbian shouldn't be a sin, if two people love each other. It's just a quest for happiness. That's all. I agree. I had a relationship with a woman for years before switching. If this is the worst sin, then I'm the clear winner. Did you forget to tell us something, Oil? Uh oh, I didn't forget. I didn't. Just saving it to tell you all at the end. I've been feeling guilty about what happened, because… Both of them must be starving by now. Should've told me they would be staying late. No. Oil. I'm such a bad person for hurting the ones who have been good to me. That old lady also looked for her own trouble. Why did she have to check on him that late? Well, she was his husband. She must take care of her husband. But you probably did it because of the drug. The sin shouldn't be as bad as doing it intentionally. You are quite sinful, Oil. I can't possibly beat you. I'm the only one who determines whose sin is worst. Your job is to tell your story truthfully. You all are wasting your time. Because when I hear my story, you will be so discouraged that you don't want to continue. Hey, Mr. Psycho just told us that he's the only one who makes the decision. Right. What makes you be so sure that your story will be worse than ours? Just tell your story, and we'll see. Just don't lie, or you will be get hurt. I like listening to your stories. You guys are unexpectedly debauched. Right, you good lady. You can die in good manner. I'll be the survivor. Because my story is indescribably super bad. Mario, you make me late for work again. What a nasty boy, doing me all night long. I have to go now. Hello Everybody has been waiting for you. This way. How could you do this again? You made a promise. You do this again. Come on, Pood. I had a little accident. Please don't be mad at me. Okay. Alright. Pood, I'll explain everything after the shooting. Hey, where's all the crew gone? Two dolly cameras. Let's rehearse for a minute. Come on, set the lights. Where's the backup light? Put the bulb in. Come on, I need light. Is it ready yet? Here they are. I asked for two cameras. Not two chairs. You morons. Idiots. Get out of here. Get out of my face. You dumbasses. Why did you kill yourself, Apidej? Why did you do this to me? Cut. Cut. Cut. Why? I said the right name. Acting was okay. It's the acting that was the problem. Jeez… can you take out half of your boobs? They're blocking the actor's head. It's a tragic scene. The lead actor is dead. You have to cry. Lots of tears. You didn't shed a single drop. Oh, My God. I'll have to wait for your tears. I can't wait. Hey, bring me the tears. Okay. Tung. Yes? What's this? Sugar. You brought me sugar. Sugar my ass. Get out. Yes. Anyone ordered a cup of coffee? How many cups? How many cups? How many cups? Scene five. Shot one. Take three. Hey, let's take a break here. Let me settle with this idiot. Oh, a big star is here even though he doesn't have to. He's here every day. I'm curious why. Have you seen Joyce? I saw her talking with Pood. Probably in the director's room. Okay. Thank you very much. I'll go to see Joyce. Let's have lunch together some other day, ladies. Ow… I understand you, Joyce. I know you have, ahh… your own reasons. Don't … be late next time. So you are not mad at me, aren't you? Well, I was never mad at you. Never. Joyce… Joyce… You have been good to me. Oh… and… I only complained because I miss you. Ooh, slow down. Slow down. Hello, Pood. Uh, isn't Joyce here? Heyyy… Komsan. Haven't seen you for a while. Oww… why did you have to rush in. I got startled… Ooh. Don't do this again … ooh… Uh… uh… Joyce? She just went out a minute ago. She went out the same way you came in. Didn't you see her? No, I didn't. Did she tell you where she was going? To…to the bathroom. I can't hold it too. Gotta get it out. Yeah, yeah. To the bathroom. Bathroom? Where's the bathroom? Out of the room. Turn right. Go straight. Turn left. It's on the right. Thank you very much. Are you feeling alright? You look kind of pale. I'm alright. I gotta take a dump. But I don't want to do it now. Holding it is a lot of fun. Ooh… In and out. In and out. I'll see you later. Almost there. I'm sorry. Oh, turn left, then go straight. Or turn right immediately? To the right. The right. Go stright. Straight. Then left. Left. Then right. Almost there. Almost there. Right. So it's not far. Not far. Almost there. Don't stop. Don't stop. What did you say? I said don't stop looking for Joyce. Or you'll miss her. You'll miss her. It'll be a shame. What have you been doing? Screwing myself, maybe? Oh. I think you're acting weird today. I have to go now. Thank you very much. Don't stop. Don't stop. What's that sound? I'm alright. I've never felt this good before. Never felt this good before. Oh. Would you like some water? I'm okay. Don't worry about me. Go. Something in your throat? Uh, some hair. Really. Cough. Hey. Make it quick. Pood. So I'll be the lead actress in your next drama series? Oh, for sure. You'll be my mistress. I mean actress, forever. Thank you. Komsan, your boyfriend is waiting for you. Let's go. Pood,don't forget. Let me get a kiss. Just go. Quickly. Joyce, where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Well, I just went to have a chat with the ladies. She never came. I mean never stop talking. I got so tired. I've looked for you everywhere. Oh, I met Pood too. He said you just went out before I came in. Darling, don't you feel that Pood look a little strange today. He seemed tensed. Couldn't concentrate. Must be sick. He must be worried about his series. I think we'd better hurry to the opening of Uncle Long's new action series. The traffic is not so good downtown. Okay. Darling, what is it around your mouth? White stain. Oh, it's just some antacid. I've been having stomachache. So I drank some of it. I must forget to wipe it out. But it seems kind of thick and dense. It tastes weird. Must have expired. Darling, you must take care of your health. Have your meals on time. Got it. I know. Let's go. Come on. Komsan, it's said that you always wait for Joyce at Pood's set. Driving her home every day. Is that true? It's true, because we are… We're close friends who happen to live on the same way. You've been going out for a while. You don't call yourself a couple? Not yet. We like to be friends. Komsan always ask me advice about a girl he likes. Oh, Komsan must be mad. He walked away. Oh, it's nothing. He's definitely not mad. He probably needs to fart. So he walked away to fart over there. May I be excused? Darling. Why did you walk away? I looked for you all over. Why did you say things like that? Everybody knows we are a couple. Come on. Don't be mad because of this nonsense. It's the actress's reply. How could I say out loud that you're my boyfriend? This is show business. You should know the deal. You've been in the business. But your tone of voice sounded like you're afraid to let people know we're dating. What are you afraid of? Don't be mad, Komsan. I'm afraid of the misunderstanding with you. Come on, honey. Don't be mad. Let me give you the big one tonight. Let's get wild tonight. I'll prepare the big one for you. Come on, darling. Joyce. Huh? Joyce. Yeah? Darling. Hey, what's the matter? Won't you turn over and look at me? What is it? Will you marry me? Are you crazy? Nonsense. Why, darling? I'm serious. You always try to dodge this question. Darling. Our relationship is going well. Our marriage could affect job offers. We should work. Save up money. Build a big house. So our kids will have good future. I will always be with you forever. I can't possibly break up with you. Alright. In one year, I will have everything you want. When that time comes, you can't turn me down again. Okay. Okay. Let me get some rest. I'm damn tired. Mario in the morning. Director in the evening. Exhausting. What are you talking about? Ton, come with me this evening. I'll give you a personal training. Thank you so much, but I'm going out with friends tonight. Ahhhh, my beloved friend. What smashing dress you're wearing. Enough chitchat. I'll take you to a new gay bar. Let's go hunt for handsome guys. God. Too many gays these days. Who would I release my tension with? Here's your dress. Alright. Someone must be doing something in here. It sounds familiar. Joyce. Joyce. How could it be fun doing it alone? You want the real thing? Oh, Joyce. How about my story? Easily the sluttiest and most sinful, isn't it? Wow, you are a star of all sluts, Joyce. Jeez. I never thought a famous actress like you could be such a slut. But I feel bad for Komsan. He's the idiot of the story. He never knows what you've done. Let me tell you something. Komsan would be better off not knowing. No. Komsan. Indescribably sinful, isn't it? Can you let me go now, Mr. Psycho? You don't have to wait for the others to finish their stories. Joyce's sins might be high in quantity. But when the causes are considered, it can be seen that most of them didn't come from her intention. But it's because she has hysteria, caused by her painful sex experience when she was young. All of her sins might be considered somewhat forgivable. Oh, hey. I've told you all of my dark side. And you tell me I'm not a sinner? What kind of freaking rule is this? It's not fair. I'm not saying you have not sinned. But your sins might not be the worst in my opinion. I'm just telling you to not be too confident, Miss Joyce. So my sins could still be the worst. If yours could be worst, mine are worse. I'm confident in my sins are second to none when it comes to debauchery. Wow, it's a close call. I don't think mine can be worse. Especially after you have heard my story. Oom, there's no way you can top mine. Just a little update. Not only that Komsan got to witness the decadence of the one he loved most, but this incident also led him to tragedy. Why did you do this to me, Joyce? Why is this happening to me? Komsan… I'm sorry. Poor him. Must be all over the news now. Yeah, but I miss this news too. This means it must have just happened. Quit being sad, girls. Listen to my story. My sins could make you feel a lot less guilty. Yeah, we're about to get on stage. The dresses are not ready yet. How could they be? The want to change the models for the finale all of the sudden. Hey, Bam. Aren't you mad at her… for stealing your spotlight right out of the blue? I don't care. I don't care whatever she does. I just want to finish this job. I'm sick to death of it. Ouch. Do it gently, will you? It's a human's head. Just a minute please. Can I ask you a question? It's rumored that you have broken up with Jack, your boyfriend. Is it true? Umm, let's talk some other day. I'm in a hurry. One moment please. It's said that Jack dumped you because he couldn’t stand your behavior. Can you elaborate on that? Just go ask him. I don't have time to explain. I'm in a hurry. Excuse me / Bam. Bam. One more question. This is the third boyfriend in five months that broke up with you. Don't you think you have had too many boyfriends? Six and a half months, not five months. Sorry, I've got to go. Aren't you afraid that you'll scare men away? Do you think this confirms your image as a playgirl? Is it possible for you to have a steady relationship? God damn it. Why the hell do you want to know this? I said I'm in a hurry. Didn't you hear me? My private life is none of your business. Why do you care? Are you my parents? Huh? Understood? How's it going, Jane? Yeah, I saw it. Damn them all. Those damn journalists. They write stories about me screwing men. I don't care. But the ones I have issues with are those wealthy old guys. Yeah, right. Bastard. If I don't screw them, they would pull me out of the job. Tell reporters I'm difficult to work with. Or that I don't keep the promise, ask for too much money. Any lies they want to make. I'm just bored to death. Whatever. When I get bored, I go to chat online. So maybe I could find wealthy old foreigner like yours. Haha. Thanks for your concern. I'm gonna hit the shower. Right. Okay. Bye-bye. Okay. It's Bambie's sexy time. Wow. Yeah. Our angel, Bambie, has just signed in. Come on, all of Bambie's fans. Let's say hi to our angel, Bambie. Dear God. Yeah Yeah. You rock, Bambie. Better get on MSN Messenger. Wonder if you've signed in, Mr. Prawit. Really miss you. Haven't talked for a while. Really want to meet you in person. Don't lie to an old dog. It's a sin, you know. I'll give you my number. Just give me a call. You're quick. Yeah. I'm free tonight. Yeah, I want to meet you. That's why I gave you my number. Where? Yeah, I know. Got it. See you in one hour. Okay. Bye-bye. You know he's married. Why are you still going out with him? None of your business. I can do what I please. I work my ass off to make money for you. Don't you dare tell me what to do. But you make money from breaking up families. I don't want your dirty money. How dare you to teach me? Mom. / Huh? You ungrateful daughter. 777 01:06:35:06 01:06:35:06 I'll cut your allowance. Don't ever tell me what to do again. Mom. Mom. Mom. Between you and me, Mom. Let's see who can screw more men. You look even prettier in person. I'm such a lucky guy. What did you tell your wife so you could get out this late? She believes whatever I tell her. She's too dumb to think otherwise. Should we start now? An old guy can be hasty too. That's alright with me. I'm starting to get hot too. Let's do it in your car. Good idea. How was it, Miss Bambie? How do you like having sex with an old guy? Not just good, but very good. I can't believe you're 48. Do I look like 60? Let's split now. It's very late. I don't want you to get spanked by your pretty wife. That hag is having a sweet dream, snoring in her bed. We have enough time to get another round. No, thank you. My rule is, once is enough. No negotiation. See you later. Bambie. Bambie. All rules can be broken. Just once. Damn it. When are you going to listen to me? You embarrass me by what you do? Embarrassed? How about you? Screwing men around. Do you think that makes me proud? I'm so embarrassed that I want to put my head in a hole. You believe those damn stories. But you never believe me. All of you men, they don't care even a little bit for you. How many have you had? Shouldn't you have learned your lessons by now? Don't you dare to raise your voice against me. I admit I had some bad men in the past. But this new husband of mine. He really cares about me. You better worry about fixing your own slutty image. Yeah, I'm a slut. I'm a bad person. Because you have been a bad example to me. What took you so long? I had to make excuses. My wife is getting suspicious. You miss me, huh? I do. I miss you a lot. You're a great lover. Let's meet tonight? Wow. I never thought an old man like me is still attractive. You got it. You name the place. How do you know? I'm sorry, Mr. Prawit. It's the price you have to pay for screwing me. Breaking up families is what I do best. All of my sins come from my full intention. There's no excuse. No need. No pressure involved. I am the one who deserves to live. Because my sins are genuinely evil. But it's just finding men to release basic sexual desire. That's not so evil. But I think she really screws around. Young or old, it doesn't matter. I don't think that's so sinful. It's more toward seeking the joy of sex. Right. Mine is a lot worse. Using sex for my own personal gain that affected a third person. How do you know that what I did didn't have direct effect? Bam. My daughter. The latest guy whom I lured to have sex with was my mother's new husband. It's my intention to take revenge on her. Isn't that sinful enough? Yeah. That's bad. Taking revenge on her own mother. What did your mom do to you that you so mad at you. That you have to take revenge on her. The reason why Miss Bam did what she did, building her own world. Using sex to control men like she always do. It's because she has been neglected by her mother all through her childhood. Her mom changes men like clothes. Causing her to become a troubled child, insecure about life and relationship. That's why she despises her mom. Seeing her as an enemy. And it leads Miss Bam to take revenge on her own mother. I get it. I think you might not be the worst sinner among us, Bam. Intentionally taking revenge on my own mother? How could it not be worst? I think screwing around senselessly like me is surely the worst. Hey, using sex to blackmail people. Betraying people who you should be grateful to. I'm the worst. Using sex for personal gain like I did. Even causing someone to die. That's the worst sin. We still have one person left from Miss Oom. Let's hear from her first. Then we can debate about which one is the worst. Do I have tell my story? Mine is really nothing. Just a little sin most girls do every day. I think. It's said that you have a big backup in Mr. Namluk to support you. What kind of relationship is it with Mr. Namluk? Oh, Mr. Namluk. He's a big brother to me. He thinks of me like his little sister. Is it true that he bought a luxurious condo for you? That's an exaggeration. He happens to have several condo projects. He didn't want me to take a long ride. So he let me stay in one of his condos until the end of this competition. How do you feel to be the favorite of this competition? I owe you all a big thank for your support. I'm not really sure if I'm really the favorite. I only know that I must prepare myself and do the best I can. Uh… how about the rumor that you … had a boyfriend before going out with Mr. Namluk. Is that true? How about the rumor that you used to be a bargirl before? Is that true? About your educational background. There's a rumor that you bought it from America. But you never went to study. Is that true? All that you said are just rumors. You know well that it happens to every beauty competition. Any contestants who are considered favorites they will get accused of negative rumors. It's normal. Panda. Panda. Can we ask some questions? Oom. Oom. Can you take a picture with Panda? How do you feel about your main competitor? She's a pretty girl. I wish you all the best. Thank you so much. Take a picture together place. The two favorites. Shoulder to shoulder. Okay. Another one. Good. Gee, Namluk. Why do you have to park this far? Were you using Blackberry to chat with girls again? I'm sorry, darling. I thought you said you don't want reporters to see us. That's why I park here. So how was your day? You must be tired. Mentally. There's this Panda girl coming out of nowhere. Shamelessly stealing all my spotlight from me Didn't you say I'm a clear winner for this one. Impossible. I've given an order to block all new faces. I don't know. You must take care of her for me. You said you can make all the decisions. Don't worry. I can take care of this thing without any problems. We control all of the judges. That Panda girl is just a half-time show. Isn't it good? We will have more time together, darling. How many times have I told you not to call me darling? You'll get used to it. The reporters will make a big news out of it. Let's go. I'm hungry. No problem, darling. Uh, baby. Oh, my dad just gave me 100,000 baht. Let's go shopping to make you feel better. Shop 'til you drop. Whatever you want. Let's go. No. Stop it, Namluk. I'm not ready. I'm sorry, darling. You're just too sexy. No man can resist your charm. I need to take a rest. There're lots of activities for the contestants to do tomorrow. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Kiss kiss. Oh. Hey. Chit, how are you doing? How am I doing? I just got out of jail. And I'm here to see my girlfriend. I plan to ask my pretty girlfriend for a place to stay. Stop your nonsense. Who's your girlfriend? I have a new boyfriend. He's rich too. You could be whacked if you don't stay away from me. Good. I can pay him a visit. Borrow him some money, so that I don't announce to the world... the filthy past of his girlfriend. Oh, don't do that, Chit. Calm down. Let's have a talk. We better go up to my room. I don't want people to see us. Oh, you are afraid your new boyfriend might know about me and dump you. Hmm… not like that. You will always be my first man for the rest of my life. Let's do something to remind us the good old days. Wait. Wait. Wait. Miss Oom. Good evening, Miss Oom. Oh, he's my brother from the upcountry. Well, I'm going to have to report this to Mr. Namluk. Come on, a friend helping another friend. Nobody. I see nobody else but Miss Oom. During this past three months, you never bring anyone home. You've always come alone. She shivered intensely when I held her. Oom, you're still the best. She seems like she's never been touched by a man. A playboy like me can't be wrong. Chit, you're the best of all the men I've screwed. Hey, don't envy me. I was born rich. I can't help it. I love you. You're the only one I love. My wedding party is going to be the talk of the town. On front page of every newspaper. What a great couple they will make. How do you feel screwing an ex-convict? Hey, I'm starting to feel pity for my girlfriend. The wedding night, she will lose her virginity to me. She's going to scream. Oh… you're the best. What are you going to do next? I don't know. You know it's difficult to find a place for a conman like me. You can stay here in the meantime. Just don't get out too often. People might see you and tell my boyfriend, uh, Mr. Namluk. Then both of us won't have a place to stay. Whatever you say, my pretty girl. This room has everything. I don't need to get anything else. I don't be wandering around. Save your energy to use it on bed with me. Oh, Chit. I have something to ask. Just tell me what you need. You know, I'm in the Miss Thailand competition this year. I'm the favorite. That's good. But you'll dump me after you get the crown, right? No, I'm not going to do that. Getting the crown is good for us. I'll be famous, get job offers. Then we can do whatever we want. I hope you'll keep your words. Of course. You'll always be my first love. I will never dump you. But there's a problem. Your rich boyfriend? Don’t worry about him. I just make a quick call. And his body will never be found. No that problem. But now there's another favorite. She is looking more like the winner. If she's gone, I would definitely win the crown. Don't worry about it. I can take care of that. My woman will certainly be crowned Miss Thailand. Let's get another round. I've been longing for it for years. How many people do you bring? Wow, that many? I'll go to meet you now. Wait for me. You want me to drop you off here? It's okay, Boonsong. I'll walk from here. I don't want any reporters to see me. So I'll wait for you here. Okay. I'll be back soon. Yes. Please don't hurt me. Time to enjoy yourselves. She's yours. Go ahead. Meet your new husbands. Oww… it hurts. You bastards. It hurts. The show has started already? You said you'd wait. That's too general, right? Nothing especially bad. Just having sex with an ex-boyfriend, and uh, cheating new boyfriend. But you told your boyfriend to hurt another person. That's a sin. Yeah, she got raped because of you. You're a badass. Maybe that Panda girl liked it. She might have liked having group sex by now. She's not a sex addict like you. Not everybody has hysteria like you. Alright. How about that Panda girl? Have you finished your story? I don't know what happened to her. All I can remember was… Bitch. You brought me here to screw a homo. She's a man. Shit. You made me rape a man. I want to puke. I'm going to have to screw you for revenge.I have to do that, Chit. Hey, how the hell would I know she's a man? Chit, you son of a bitch. You're going to let these bastards rape me? For fun. My girlfriend is my friends' girlfriend too. When you don't screw me, you go on screwing around anyway. Go ahead. Go ahead if you want her. Where are you going, Oom? / No. That's the last thing I remember. I ran away from them as fast as I could. The next thing I know was being in this room with you guys. I think it's your boyfriend Chit who took all of us here. He and his gang. Right. They probably want to torture and rape us. Oom and Panda couldn't satisfy their lust. Just to rape some girls, do they need the plan this complicated? And how could Chit and his gang kidnap us all? It doesn't make a lot of sense. Right. I've never known any of you before. Definitely not Chit's work. It's me, Panda. Hello everyone. Huh? Panda. How could you come here? Shit. She is going to get the police to arrest you, Oom. I don't have anything to do with you, Panda. Right. Right. Right. We never knew this Oom girl before. Oh, my. Poor pretty little girl. I could've sworn you're a real woman. You're such a bitch to have done what you did, Oom. Are you alright, Panda? You've come to rescue us, right, Panda? Did you have to ask her if she's alright, Oil? She was just gang raped, not crowned Miss Universe. You don't have to hurry. And I can't help you in anyway. Because all of us here are already dead. Welcome to hell. How did you do it? Must have cost a lot of money. You want to take revenge on me? Who's your sponsor for all this? Right. How did you change your clothes so quickly? Where did you learn this clothes changing trick? Did you have sex with David Copperfield? You're using sex to take revenge. What did you say? About all of us already dead. What do you mean? Right. How could I be dead? I haven't had sex with Rain. I can't die yet. All of us, including me, are already dead. It's true. Miss Nan Runglawan, you die in Mr. Ar's hands. He choked you so hard that you couldn't breathe. Ow. It hurts. Arrgh… Next is Miss Oil Adchara. While you were having sex with the Uncle, Your intoxication of the drug caused you to fell down the balcony to your death. What an awful death. Ow… It hurts, all over my body. Now your body is returning to the real condition before you die. Now Miss Joyce. You're the unlucky one. The stranger you had sex with turn out to be a serial killer. You became one of his slashed victims. Bastard. My bowels are falling out. Son of a bitch. I let you screw me. It's bound to happen one day, Miss Joyce. Miss Bam, you died painfully too. Jeez, mom. Didn't you know that you were shooting your own daughter? Mom, look before you shoot next time. She didn't know it was you. You didn't tell her you were the one who had sex with her husband. If not, a mother would never kill her own daughter. Oom, your sin pays you back immediately. Help. Help. No. Run without looking could end in a pitiful death. That's why I can't remember anything after you got gang raped. it hurts. Not long after you died, I soon followed you to hell. I committed suicide by overdosing sleeping pills. She's a smart bitch. Her body stays pretty. Damn it. And what do we have to do with you? It's between you and Oom. Right. Why did you bring us here? Shouldn't we get punished somewhere? You go ahead. I want to get reborn again. I won't make mistakes again. Please, pretty Panda, please. It's no use asking her, Nan. She is a soul like all of us. She doesn't have any power to decide. That's right. I don't have any power to do that. But there's a reason why I took you all to confess to your sins. 1132 01:37:38:05 01:37:44:05 The only way to alleviate this sin, so I could possibly get reborn, is to find the explanation of why I killed myself for at least five reasons. Only then that this grave sin could only be lessened. Oom, the sin you did to me was clearest and most direct. Miss Nan, do you know… that Mr. Ar's wife who died with her unborn child because of what you did was my own sister. What a small world. Oil, do you know that the Uncle's wife, It's not true. She was my aunt, who had raised me since I was young. How the hell would I know? Miss Joyce, you probably didn't know that Komsan, your lover, who drove away in tears from the scene and had a fatal accident. He was my only brother, whom I loved the most. God damn it. How many relatives do you have? Miss Bam, you didn't know either that ... Mr. Prawit,your mother's new husband, who got shot tragically by your mother… He was my real father. Okay. Whatever. What a mess we're in together. And these are the five sins that were done to me, causing me to commit suicide, God of the Underworld. Alright. I've heard your explanation. Your punishment deserves to be lessened from being tortured in hell forever. I will give you a chance to be reborn. Thank you so much, God of the Underworld. Use this chance well. Live your life happily on earth. You will be born a real woman. May your life be free of the miserable fate you have had in the past life. Go, Panda. Now, I will announce the punishment for each of your sin. Joyce, your sin is least among your friends. You had sex senselessly because of your disease. You will be sent to the first level of hell for one human life, before you get the right to be reborn. Nan, your sin is second least. Sex for personal gain.You will be tortured in the second level for two lives. Oil, your sin was pretty serious. Three lives in the fifth level. Bam. You ungrateful daughter. You go straight to the seventh level for five lives. Oom, your sin was the worst. You will stay in hell forever. Never get to be reborn. My judgment is considered final. No pleas or appeals allowed. It's not the end yet. There's more. I know it's the Candid Camera show.Hey. Come out. Come out now. This is not fun at all. What kind of damn show is this? How would my fans in the upcountry think about this? They've been through my ups and down. I'm so embarrassed. It took two hours to put on. You fake Korean star. You stole my husband. Ananda… I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere. I like gossip stories. It's hard to find good men. You better stay a lesbian. How can I help you? You must've taken a nap. Come on. Take the stuff to the car. Mr. Bird is a little off trend. He's in Korean look now. I can't see how his music will turn out. Pop music is dead, I guarantee. If you really want to know, go home to ask your mom and dad. Here, Mr. Kui, director of Dek-Khong. How do you do? This is Mr. Nu Dang. He's my sponsor. Is this the actress I can screw? Yes. Yes. Hey, the event is today, not tomorrow. I'm the nine-inch,two-fist long sergeant. You remember me now, don't you? People here call you the hundred husband model. Dragon Soaring drug.You can't live without it. Naga Pumping. It's the best men can get. Thank you so much for your support. I need to go now. I hope to work with you again. Good night. It's impossible for Thai soccer team to go to the World Cup, Namluk. It's easier for Thai soccer team to be World Champion Boxers. Don't worry. The judges are ours. You're so unfashionable. Get out of here. One more thing. Help me by practicing safe sex, will you? Hell is getting more and more crowded. More people coming here because of AIDS. Come on, safe sex. Huh? Come on,what have you been doing? I've been waiting to help you relax. Ahhh. I'm coming now, Suwan. Now you know. In here,being homosexual is not considered a sin. Oom. My daughter. She's gone, mom. I'm sorry for your loss. We've tried our best. Hey. Are you alright, doctor? Where's Panda? Calm down, Oom. Panda has passed away. But we're glad to have you back. It means I, Oom, is reborn as a woman. My dream has finally come true. The End.
