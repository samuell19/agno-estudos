It's over now. ﻿It's over now. ﻿You'll be alright. ﻿- Are you ok? ﻿- Yeah. ﻿I think I need a drink. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿I don't want to know where it is. ﻿- I'm sorry. ﻿- It's ok. ﻿Everything I hate in myself ﻿comes from her. ﻿I don't want to be her! ﻿You're not your mother! ﻿You're nothing like her! ﻿You embrace life, you move forward. ﻿You'll never end up like her. ﻿- It was an accident. ﻿- No. suicide! ﻿It was raining. ﻿It's tragic but it happens. ﻿She was dead drunk. ﻿It was no accident. ﻿I don't think I should ﻿be staying with you guys. ﻿I'm in your way. ﻿In our way? ﻿You're never in our way. ﻿You're never in our way. ﻿The kids love you. ﻿I know, I love them too. ﻿It's just that... ﻿I feel like ﻿you've managed to build a life. ﻿I'm alone. ﻿I work odd jobs ﻿I'm 36 and still doing my thesis. ﻿Don't be silly. ﻿Seriously, I think ﻿I'm in the process of becoming a loser. ﻿Nonsense. ﻿You're the freest person I know. ﻿You're never complacent. ﻿You'll be ok. don't doubt yourself. ﻿I miss Mom so much! ﻿Don't you? ﻿No ﻿How do you hold it together so well? ﻿I fake it. ﻿Has the abortion been scheduled? ﻿Yes. ﻿We're going for an ultrasound first. ﻿I believed it all. ﻿But two hours later ﻿I began to wonder. ﻿I'm not sure ﻿what he told me is true. ﻿I never told you. ﻿Before Mika, there was ﻿a woman who got pregnant. ﻿When she gave birth, the child was dead. ﻿Still born. ﻿His tears were like in a film I love ﻿where he plays a widower. ﻿At the time, ﻿I absolutely believed he was sincere. ﻿Only when I was alone ﻿did I begin to doubt. ﻿But I'd already given him hope. ﻿When is the abortion? ﻿It was yesterday. ﻿But I got it postponed 3 days. ﻿Then I'll fly to the island ﻿for the shoot. ﻿What do you want? ﻿I think I need your help. ﻿I can't think, ﻿I can't trust my decisions. ﻿I'm trying to help you. ﻿You have to see him. ﻿Come to the shoot. ﻿ I can't think anymore. ﻿No, impossible. ﻿I can't do that ﻿and it wouldn't help. ﻿I can't do that ﻿and it wouldn't help. ﻿We're on Stromboli in 4 days. ﻿I'm nearly 3 months along. I'm terrified. ﻿I can't do it. ﻿A young woman... ﻿actress... ﻿just starting out... ﻿first film... ﻿Characters... ﻿Margot, Gabriel... ﻿Selma, you know that's off limits. ﻿I just read the writing. ﻿Nothing's written. ﻿It's my work. ﻿Edith, please. ﻿Come here. ﻿You need to learn ﻿to manipulate your mom. ﻿It'll come in handy later, too. ﻿Tell her you feel ﻿she doesn't love you. ﻿Or less than your sister. ﻿Or say you feel ﻿she's disappointed in you. ﻿Or that at school, ﻿someone you like hates you. ﻿Make her pity you. ﻿You've got two things ﻿going on with her. ﻿She's your mom, ﻿and she's a shrink. ﻿Moms hate to see ﻿their children suffer. ﻿But for shrinks.. ﻿it's a crime! ﻿Get it? ﻿Go see her. ﻿Act really unhappy, ﻿and say, "Mom, ﻿I'm afraid I lack the tools ﻿to make it in life." ﻿Sad puppy eyes. ﻿Cosette. ﻿Go on. ﻿That's it. ﻿Lay it on thicker. ﻿Perfect. Go get her. ﻿Mom... ﻿I'm afraid I lack the tools ﻿to make it in life. ﻿Honey! ﻿What're you talking about? ﻿You're far too young ﻿to worry about that. ﻿Why do you say such things? ﻿You bet you have the tools. ﻿She's got strange worries for her age. ﻿Remember how she looked at you ﻿in the maternity ward? ﻿You know, ﻿I'd never imagined my child would. ﻿judge me or even look at me. ﻿I felt her eyes asking me, ﻿"Who are you?" ﻿You have to have fun, play with the monster inside you. ﻿I don't believe ﻿in the whole method acting thing, ﻿digging deep down ﻿almost religiously. ﻿I believe in lies. ﻿Making things up. ﻿Deep down inside, I'm often empty. ﻿Totally empty. ﻿I gotta make it happen somehow. ﻿That's what they pay me for. ﻿Mika is... ﻿a woman l truly admire. ﻿I have deep admiration ﻿and respect for her. I'd even say she's the first woman ﻿I've loved this way. ﻿Just to meet him once. ﻿No way, there's no reason. ﻿She's testing you. Say no. ﻿Your role is to stay in the fantasy. ﻿But you want to? ﻿No, but.. ﻿I need to know who I'm dealing with. ﻿Who Margot's dealing with. ﻿Not you or your character. ﻿Want to talk about Gabriel? ﻿I'm so happy your book is out. ﻿What can I do for you? ﻿Get out of my life. ﻿You take up too much space. ﻿You're too alive. ﻿You're cutting me in half. ﻿I'm starting to resent helping you. ﻿You found your place. ﻿I probably helped. ﻿It's all good, I'm happy for you. ﻿Almost happier ﻿than I would be for myself. ﻿You're leaving ﻿because you helped me? ﻿You took on the role of helping me ﻿because your pride wanted to save me. ﻿But I never saw you that way. ﻿Deep down, maybe you preferred me ﻿when I was down. ﻿You can't handle me up? ﻿In life, ﻿we change, we evolve. ﻿Nothing's clean or set in stone! ﻿It's crazy to reject that! ﻿You're pathetic ﻿if you don't accept that. ﻿I'll be a shit for you. ﻿Prefer me weak? ﻿I'll be a shit. ﻿Must see you.

Gabriel is dead to me now. ﻿Who was my father? ﻿What makes you ask? ﻿Why don't I see him? ﻿I told you. ﻿He left before you were born. ﻿Then why did you guys make me? ﻿We loved each other very much. ﻿That makes no sense. ﻿Why'd he leave? ﻿Was he unhappy when I came? ﻿No, he was very happy. ﻿He loved you ﻿even before you were born. ﻿But... ﻿he had things to do elsewhere. ﻿Never doubt his love. ﻿Do I look like him? ﻿Yes. ﻿Do you think of him ﻿when you see me? ﻿Yes. ﻿It's as though ﻿part of him lives inside you. ﻿Do you like it?
