You look good. See? Oh, geez, Mom. You scared me. I'm not the one talking to a dead guy. - What do you want? - Upstairs! I'm in the middle of something right now. He can wait! Happy birthday! No, I'm not celebrating. I told you. 27 hours of labor. I think it's more my call than yours. Your mother preferred to stay in even then. Okay. Make your wish. Wait. Did you even make one? I couldn't think of anything, you make one. Seriously. - Mhm. - Okay, um... Okay. - What was it? - Just blow. Nah, ah, ah, ah. Other room for presents. Frank, now! Frank that's your cue, come on! Oh my God. Mom. A blowup doll? Come on, I'm not that desperate. You said that you wanted to practice some greener embalming techniques, and maybe teach Sam. What do you expect me to teach Sam with that? - He's way better than a banana. - Sam. Well obviously, I ordered the wrong kind of doll. But isn't he gorgeous? Oh yeah, Gram thinks he kind of looks like dad. - How? - His eyes, no hair. Anyway, we kept him, and we've named him Pedro. Oh, and we have another present for you. And it's in his pants. - And I'm done. - Oh Frank, wait. Will you to the intake for Ann-Marie Toddy? Right. Okay, his pants? His pocket. - We're going to Moscow! - Who is? Me and you, Mom! Gram booked us on a tour, and we're leaving in a month. That means "I wish to buy some cheese." - Or it might mean... - Sam... That your cheese smells like feet... Stop please. I still don't remember. And wait, wait, wait. Look, I made a calendar. Put it away. - Mom, I've been crossing off the days... - Put it away. - So that whenever we get close to the day... - Put it away now. - Mom! - Whatever you did, cancel it. - How could you get her hopes up like this? - Don't yell at her. - Sam... - I had as much to do with this as she did. Did you really think that this was something that was for real? You didn't think we would actually go? No, of course not. It's you. - Just forget about it, I don't even care anymore. - Oh come on, Sam. What were you thinking? She has wanted to go to Moscow since she learned how to talk. Yes, but that's because of Peter. And Mom, of all the places, I mean you know what's going on there right now? It's kind of a disaster. The whole world is a disaster. - You have to find a way to live in it. - Please, Mom, I found my way, I like my way, - and I'm happy. - Good for you. - And Sam? - Did you have any idea that there were 20,000 homicides in Russia last year? Do you know that we're in the middle of a Cold War 2.0? You think it's a safe place to... It is a plane ticket and a plane ride. If it was a matter of flipping a switch, don't you think I would've flipped it by now? You have to cancel it. Where are you going? It is my lottery day. Oh, and you have a dead body waiting for your downstairs. Crap. Ann-Marie Toddy. Mom, where are the hedge clippers? Garden, why? 'Cause she's too fat for the truck cart. - Oh. - What? Everybody does it, Dad taught me. Well, it's going to take about a thousand cute little kitten videos to get that image out of my head. - Hey guys! - Hi! Hi, Molly! Hi, Suz, looking good! Don't I know it! Mom, will you grab those hedge clippers for me before you go? They're right there, next to the geraniums. Are you serious? - The lottery calls. - You know you're 9,000 times more likely to get hit by lightning than you are to win the lottery. It's just for fun, Molly. Remember fun? - Woo hoo! - -We're gonna do it this time! Don't stare at me. Sam? Sam! Sam? Mama! Knock much? There's somebody at the door. So? So, Frank is out, and Grandma's getting a lotto ticket. Why don't you get him to answer it? Answer the door, Sam. Come to Moscow, Mom. Come on! No. Not anymore, I'm done. Ugh. Okay. - Sorry. - Hi. Hi, I'm Joe... Frederickson. My father's... visitation is this afternoon, Harold Frederickson. Well, the parlor entrance is just around the side. Tried that, no one answered. Well that's because I think you're a little early. - Is that a problem? - You know, my mother usually handles this stuff, and she's not here. I'm sorry, you know what? No, it's not a problem. Just, if you go around the side, I'll make sure it's open. Oh, wait, before you go, could you grab those hedge clippers for me? Sure. Thank you. - That way. - Oh, yeah, got it. Don't start. - Why is the door still locked? - He's early. - Unlock it. - I already did. - Okay, go get dressed. - What? Here, take this. That was Frank, and he'll be handling your father's service. I really wanted to see him before you did all that. Oh. You know, you think you would, but trust me, it is better this way. What color is his face? Beige bisque number 40. I wanted to see him, not some made up version of him. I can change it if you'd like me to. No, no. I'm sorry, it's fine. Fine. Well, you'd be the first. We aren't built to be fine with this. I'd also like to read a passage. When everybody gets here, from "A Calendar of Wisdom". Tolstoy. Yeah. Yeah. - Is that going to be here? - No. - What is that? - A training aid. What? Um... I just had too much coffee. What's wrong? Are you okay? No, I'm not. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm going to let you have some time with him. Your father, not the doll, obviously. That would be really weird. I will be down the hall, and Frank should be in soon. - Wait, wait. What's your name? - Molly. Molly. Wow. Way too much coffee. Aw, shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit. What are you doing to his face? It's all wrong! It's not him. Of course it's not him, right? It's some place he used to hang out. An abandoned building. How did you know him? Oh, um, I don't, didn't. I just live here, and I'm not supposed to be down here when there are people, so. Could I have his tie clip back? What? The one on your head. Oh, it's a barrette, it's mine. I made it for him, in Eagle Scouts. It's got my initials on it. J.F. Joe Frederickson. I must, um... I don't know how that got here, it just... Probably happened when you took it. Are you going to tell? - I wasn't there. - Where? When he... Working. Working... Out of the country. Whoa! Did he... Did he just breathe? Oh, no. It just looks like that sometimes. He didn't, don't worry. So... Why were you out of the country? I make documentaries. Oh my God, I'm like so addicted to the Discovery Channel. - Would I have seen anything of yours? - Possibly. You know, it's so cool that you get to travel. I was supposed to go to Moscow in a few weeks and I got a passport, and I was learning Russian, and then... You know what, I'm sorry. I should just leave you alone. It was nice to meet you, by the way. And I'm sorry about your dad. Um, is this weird? Not really. Thanks. About... About what I did... I don't know what you're talking about. Good to see you. Thank you, appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, thank you for being here, I really appreciate it. Thanks for coming all the way. Hey, Buddy. Yeah, yeah, good to see you. Be careful. What a beautiful necklace, Ann-Marie. Gorgeous. All right, I wanted a good picture to work from but... And it's expired. Still talking to them? You know that's creepy, right? Molly, it's me! Molly! It's okay, Mom. One, two, three. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Oh, God. I'm sorry, Sam. I know. I'm sorry I was gone so long. Come here, let's eat. Come here. Atta boy. That's a good boy. Not yet. Hey, here you go. Do you know what the movie is? You have to go on this trip, Molly. Do you hear me? You have to take this trip. Mom, Gram, hurry up, it's movie night. You hear that? Let's go. So what are we watching tonight? You know that guy that was here today? The kind of hot one, Joe. - What about him? - He makes documentaries, and I found one on demand. It's about cruelty to animals in circuses and animal shows all over the world. One of them is about the Moscow Cat Theater. - So, he's been to Russia, which is so cool. - When did you talk to him? - Earlier. - And you thought he was hot? I don't know, kind of like someone's dad hot. Oh, and... I got us hats. Aw. One for you, Mama. And one for you, Babushka. Thank you, darling. Mhm. I ordered them when I thought we would still... - Sam, I'm... - No, it's okay. One more thing. Here's your date. Every kid's dream is to run away and join the circus, right? Well, I actually did it, as a grown up, but still. I left my whole life. Then a dream just turned into a nightmare. And what made you decide to come forward? The circus is a lie. Molls. Are you really thinking about going? You don't even go to the grocery store. You couldn't even take a few steps outside this afternoon. You're not real. This is real. Sam. Wake up. Sam. What? We're going. Going where? To Moscow. - We're going. - Really? Really, really, really? Just the two of us. But how? I don't know yet, but we're going. Okay. I love you, Mom. I love you too. Go to sleep. ♪ If I can't have Everything I wished for ♪ ♪ At least there's more Left for me to dream ♪ ♪ C'est la vie ♪ ♪ C'est la vie ♪ Is something burning, Mom? No... Yes. Oh my God. - Oh my, get me the... - Got it. - Yeah. - Here. Ugh. - Take the batteries out. - What? What is happening? On the side, give it to me. - What were you cooking? - I wasn't cooking. What? Then how did that get in there? Were you cooking something? An oven mitt, I guess. Hey, grab your shoes, we're late! I'll get Oleg. Oleg? I thought it was Pedro. I rechristened him in honor of your trip. Someone was careless enough to throw their birthday gift in the trash, so I liberated him. In a new outfit? - He needed a bath. - Hm. He's not coming with us. Oleg loves riding in a car. I'm just going to go open the windows so he can stick his head out. That's dogs, Mom. I'll go to my room. Your room? - But Gram, we have to go. - Go where? Dress rehearsal. Oh my God. Get her, Sam, grab her. Mama, Mom, you okay? Oh. Oh, I'm fine. Sam, will you get that? Mom, I'm going to call Dr. Barlow. Oh, no. I just forgot to eat breakfast so I took my blood pressure pills on an empty stomach. I'm fine. I'm sorry, this is crazy. So crazy to bring him here. Mom? Joe. What happened? It's Tuck. He was just lying there cold. And I was going to bury him in the backyard, but I thought my condo association would frown on that. Oh, I don't do pets. I don't even know if that's allowed. Honey, you just cut open a plus-sized woman with a pair of garden shears. You're not going to help this poor man with his dog? And I couldn't just dump him somewhere because he was a rescue, and he has abandonment issues. Honey, we have to get going, you're going to be so late! Joe can take me. - Right, Joe? - No. Well, why don't you take me? - How many points do you have? - Points? - On your license. - None. How do you do that? - I've got... - You have so many. - I'm a very good driver. - I'm going to be so, so late. Okay, I'll take him. And I'll do what I can, but I can't embalm him. No, no, that's not what I, I didn't mean... I didn't have anywhere else to go. He's my family. Okay. It's okay. I got him. Thank you. - Bye, Sam. - Bye. - Honey, I'll see you later at the recital. - Okay. I brought you some company. Oh, great. What do you think he's going to do with him? You think he's going to keep him like Roy Rogers did with Trigger? I don't know, Mom, I'm not a taxidermist. Your mother must think I'm nuts. Well, glass houses. What do you mean? Nothing. Do you? Think I'm nuts? I've seen worse. I don't want you driving. I am not missing that recital. Okay. Doctor first, and then Frank will drive you, - you promise me? - No. Stop treating me like an old person. I've got at least ten good years before... - 70 is the new 60. - Mom... Come with me. You know I can't! You don't have to come to the office, - you can stay in the car. - Frank will drive you. You told Sam that you would go on this trip. How do you think you're going to make it if you can't even go four miles to the doctor's office. Molly, I... I need you. Not Frank this time. You. Okay. What's the strangest thing you've ever seen? Why do you make documentaries? I, um... I think I'm a pretty good witness of other people's lives, other people's moments. That's the pretentious answer. The real answer is I'm more comfortable with a camera in front of my face than without one. Are you sure you want to hear? 'Cause it's about a ten on the crazy ways to die scale. Then I'm sure. So there was this pigeon. This pigeon who clearly did not do his homework in regards to peanut allergies, and who obviously did not know that even a whiff of the tiny legume can send some people into anaphylactic shock. That dumb bird could've had no way of knowing that. When he ate those peanuts in that park, he was however unintentionally, committing manslaughter. 47 people were killed by lightning that year. 75 by cataclysmic storms, and as far as I know, only one has ever been killed by peanut infested pigeon poop. Would've been a lot funnier if it wasn't my dad. Sam. Yeah? I'm pretty sure that's an 11. At least. I'm really sorry. I can't believe you're doing this guy's dog, you didn't even do me. You just farmed me out. You're spending all this time brushing this dog's hair, and you didn't even spend a second with me. Just threw me in the trash last night. - I am not talking to you. - Why not? - Because I refuse to be insane. - Well, I don't think you really have a choice on that matter, do you? Molly! - Oh, shit. - What? Where are you going, Molly? I want to go. You can do this, Molly. I have faith in you, come on. Just one step at a time. That's it, yes. That's it! - No, I can't, Mom. - But if you just do... - I can't! - Yes, you can! - Get off my back! - I can't do it, I can't! Where are you going? What are you doing? What are you doing with that? Carpool lane. You almost hit me! What are you doing, you lunatic? I'm driving you. - What the... - Molly called. Guess she wanted me on standby, just in case. Just in case. Oh hey, can I have that? You quit 20 years ago, you're supposed to be my inspiration. Yeah, some inspiration, come on. It's not like I ever light it. Then give it to me. I only have the one. ♪ Hey little girl is Your daddy's home ♪ ♪ Going to leave me all alone ♪ ♪ Step outside, let the Going wind blow ♪ ♪ Gotta go live like We're never going to die ♪ ♪ Gotta go live ♪ You know how some dogs will run or bark in their sleep? Not Tuck. Tuck, when he slept, he would sing. - Sing what? - I'm tone deaf, but I swear it was a howling version of "Stairway to Heaven". Wow. Why does this hurt so much? With my dad I was just numb, but this... Pure pain. I think pets give us permission. What you did for me today, not many people would've done that. Oh, it was nothing really. I cleaned him up and brushed his fur. How do you know that this is what you wanted to do with your life? Not every little girl's dream, you mean? Well, for me, it was. And this is my dad's place, and he wanted a son, he had me, so he taught me instead. And I would run around embalming my Barbies. You... - You're so... - What? Nothing. Oh. No, no, I don't... I didn't mean you're nothing, you're... You're... The strangest girl I ever met. There's a pet cemetery over on Grove. It's pretty, it's like a park. I could give them a call. No, no, no, no. I got it from here. Okay. Come on, boy. Joe? I'm sorry I keep kissing you. I'm not. Where's your necklace? - So? - What? So, what did the doctor say? If you were so interested, you could've come with me. Mom, what did she say? What they always say, I need more tests. You were gone an awfully long time to just hear "More tests". Yeah, well, Frank and I stopped at Loomer's for a drink. Oh, and Pedro here was very popular with the bikers. Don't make me ask Frank what the doctor said, because I will. They think it was a mini stroke, and that can affect your balance and your memory. Stroke? - I have to cancel the trip. - Don't you dare use me to get out of this. Don't you dare. You need to sort yourself out. You had a stroke, Mom. That's serious! A stroke! I did not have a stroke. - You did! - No! Sam. I called you about a hundred times. The recital. I forgot. I'm so sorry, sweetheart, I just forgot. Are you dying? No! No. Oh no, it sounds worse than it is, they just have to run some tests to see what's going on in my noggin. Oh, that's all it is, honey. Sam! Peter. Are you there? I need you! Sam. Sam, can we talk? Can we talk later? Sure, honey. I love you. I love you too, Gram. You okay, Molls? You're here. All you had to do was ask. But I did it, not before. Yeah, maybe not out loud. If anything happens to my mom... I know. I know, I know, I know, I know. Is it really you? I want it so much to be you. Even if it means taking a little flight over the cuckoo's nest? It doesn't feel crazy, it feels real. Then I'll stay. Then I'll stay, Molls. I missed you. Did you really think something as trivial as dying would keep us apart? Hm? - Did you? - No. I love you so much. I love you. Hey, did any of the parents get video yesterday? Yep, all of them. Oh, I'll call Rachel's mom. No, it's okay. I sucked anyway. I'm sure that's not true. No, let your mother get it. She needs the practice. I'll do it! - Hi. - Hi. Hi. - What are you... - Oh, I just stopped by to say hello. Before the viewing. Oh, no. Another funeral. - Yeah. - Did you know Ann-Marie well? Oh, she was a distant relative. Really very distant. Well, the viewing is that way. Oh yeah, I remember. - Sorry. - And if there's anything I can do... Okay, thank you. Oh. Hey. Hi. How'd she die? I'm not really sure. So, she's not family then? No, no. A friend? Yeah, not exactly. Who is she? Oh, Ann-Marie Toddy. You don't really know her, do you? I wanted to see your mother again, and when she opened the door, I panicked. You've been here for a really long time. Five hours. Oh my God. Well, I was going to leave when her family came in, and nobody ever did. Nobody. Bunions bugging ya? I don't have bunions. Just my feet hurt. Yeah, that's because you always buy your shoes a half size too small. I'm a seven and a half. No, you're an eight. Let me see them bunions. You don't have bunions. You just got perfect feet. Let me massage them. I have to go back to work. Oh, come on, Molls. Five minutes. I know you miss my massages, don't act like you don't. What were you watching? - No shoes! - Right? Come on, Mommy, dance with us! You want me to dance? Who's going to take the video? Who cares? Just dance with us! - Dance! - All right, we're going to spin. Get in there. Come here, baby girl. Dance with me. Wow, where did you find that? To us. It's not even five o'clock. It's after midnight in Moscow. Mm. Come on, Molls. Yeah. Yes. Right? Why do you think nobody came? You're not actually her family, Joe. I don't think you're allowed to do that. Well, if they ever show up for her, they can tell me to stop. Remember my thesis project in Moscow? That tiny sixth floor flat. I mean, we just had to heat our water up on the stove just to take a hot bath. Except for that one crazy day in November. All of a sudden, this flat with no hot water heater, the water ran hot. I took a bath all day. Just kept filling the tub up with hot water until it ran out. That's the night we made Sam. Do you want to go on a date? With you? No. That would be illegal. With my mom. That is why you're here, right? You like her? I do. So then ask her. It's been a pretty long time for me, Sam. Well, you can't keep pretending like you're a friend or a relative of every recently deceased person in town. Why not? Just ask her. Look. Ann-Marie Toddy even thinks you should ask her. Look. Go on a date, Joe. - Sam! - Joe. - Okay. - Wait, seriously? Then let's go right now, come on. No, stop. That's something I should do alone, thanks. Okay, I'll go get her before you change your mind. No, Sam! Mom? Mom? Mom? - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Get out! Oh. Molly. You should get dressed. You kept my clothes? Yeah. Ah, I love you. Molly, hey. - Hi. - Hi, Mom. Samantha. Now? Uh, Molly. I was wondering, I was just wondering if uh... Who paid for the funeral? She did. In advance. It was very nice of you to stay the whole day. Oh, it wasn't quite the whole... Would you like to go out with me sometime? - Go out? - On a date. I got it from here, Sam. Oh... Hello, Joe. Joe, I would like that, really, but going out is a little bit tricky for me. Why? Yeah, Mom. Why? There's... For one thing, my mother's not very well. I am just fine. - Yeah, you should go. - Go where? On a date with Joe. God, yes. Have some fun. - Friday? - 6:30? It's a date. Oh shit, I'll be right back. I may not have done this in a while, but I'm pretty sure that was a no. Mom! You just walked out on him. I can't do this right now. You should have knocked! Seriously? That's your response? I do not want to have this conversation with you. I can go my whole life without having this conversation. I am your mother, and I have feelings and needs. He was meant to be a gag gift, Mom. Not a boyfriend. Please just do it for me! - Molly... - Okay. Okay? Really? Um, then I'll pick you up. Does Friday, 6:30 still work? Seven. I volunteer at the animal shelter, my first shift is Friday. See you then? See you then. What just happened? You have a real, live date with a real, live person. We need to get to work. On what? The plan. Oh honey, fix your hair. - Why? - It's in your eyes. Welcome to your online support group. Everyone, this is Molly. Mom, this is everyone. Hi, Molly. Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

So, we stay in. Wait, I tell you something incredibly screwy about myself and your response is "we'll stay in"? Well, I guess I have one question. What's that? Order delivery or raid the fridge? I like your house. It hums. My house? Just no hum. Seriously, what is wrong with you? You really want to know? Would you tell me if I did? I work all the time. I eat like crap. I can go weeks without speaking to a soul, well, except the kid at the drive-through where I get my chicken nuggets, who just lost his virginity, by the way. And he's going off to college to leave me to get my nuggets from a total stranger who's never going to remember what dipping sauce I like, which is barbecue, by the way. And my dog just died. You'd be huge in country music. You think? This is fun! Shall I be offended that you sound surprised? No, it's a nice surprise. I think we should do delivery. There's a melon. I get everything delivered because... The one thing I really miss is picking my own produce, because I used to love to pick it up and smell it, and now some other person smells it, like the produce guy. I don't know, it just seems gross to me that somebody else would pick up my melon and smell it. I don't know, do you think that's gross? It seems kind of gross to me. Sorry, I just wanted to get that in. - You okay? - Yeah, it's just been a while for me. Well, yeah, me too, I... - Whoa! - Oh. Oh, God, I can explain that, it's sort of a "Where's Waldo?" thing trick that Sam plays on me. Oh, God. How long is this going to take? Four, five minutes? Peanuts? - Stop! - What, stop? - No, don't stop. - No, don't? You know what I miss? Bike rides. I miss bike rides with Sam. How's Sam, by the way? Fine! Just fine? No. The quiet ones with the most secrets. Nice pin you found. And those pearly rings. And those cuff links. Did you ever find those cuff links? Oh my God, Peter. Um, it's Joe. Hey, you obviously have things going on, so, I think I should just... Goodbye, Molly. Okay. Wow, really? Look, you're not over him, it's okay. I understand that part. But this was just a stupid idea, I don't know what I was thinking. I'll see you around. Actually, I won't, because you don't go around anywhere. So I won't see you anywhere, ever. Wait, Joe? Oh, and I love the three a.m. feedings, most people don't. But I did. And sometimes when your Grandpa Mike was sleeping, I would get out of bed, and just watch your mom breathe. Mom? Who are you talking to? Sammy. Sam's not here, Mom. She's not? No. I know, I know. But you should see your face. Not funny. I'm just recording some stories for her, and Joe said he'd edit them together for me. - Mom? - What? Did you give Sam a pair of pearl earrings? No. Sam has been stealing from the deceased. What? I don't know how I could've missed it. I don't understand how I could've missed something this big. We could lose the business, Mom. Yeah, well I missed it too. God, I am so sick of being afraid. You have to find that one thing that is bigger than your fear. Well, that's easy for you to say, you've never been afraid of anything in your entire life. I am now. That's her. You scared me. Sorry. You should wear a bell. Like how cats wear bells. Are you drunk? Why? You going to ground me? If I go outside, are you going to chase me? I need to sit down. What were you drinking? Dad's vodka. I thought you were with Rachel's family. Rachel doesn't talk to me anymore. Why? - Look at us in this house, Mom, we're freaks. - No we're not. Mom, you're screwing a doll. Okay. - I want you to homeschool me. - No. - I want to stay here like you. - No. You don't know what it's like. You hide inside this place all day long. We are never going to Moscow. How can we get on a plane when you can't even get past the driveway? I watched you tonight. You couldn't even make it to his car. I tried. I'm never going back to school, I hate it there. It'll get better, Sam. No. You don't get to say that. Not when you've missed every single dance recital and soccer game and doctor's appointment. - I have seen the videos for every... - Videos? You haven't been here. You are missing my whole life. Why did he leave us? Why did he ride his stupid bike that day, and why didn't he take his epinephrine with him? He never forgot it, he never forgot it! He never forgot it! What's going on? She's drunk. - I don't feel good. - Drunk? - Help me out. - What happened? Come on. Mom. Please let me stay here, let me stay in this house forever like you. I found your box, Sam. Everything you stole. I found this in there. This was supposed to be buried with your father. It was in his pocket. Do you know how I know that? Because I put it there! Do you realize what you have done? Do you realize that you can ruin the family business? Why would you do something like this? Because they had you, Mom. You have to give it back. Every single piece! Do you hear me? Okay, I will, but you have to take me. You have to take me, you have to take me out... Molly! Take me, Mom! God damn it! Mama's here, Mama's here. One good green light. You can do it, baby. Mama's got you. Go to the door. Go, honey, go. Mom? Mom! Sam! Mom... You're my everything. Sam. Sam, my everything. There. Mom. You have to do it. I can't. Mom, she would want it to be you. I can't imagine it being anyone but you, you have to do it. No, I can't do it, sweetheart, it's not the professional thing. Professional? Mom... It's not about professional. You don't know what you're asking me, Sam. Yes, I do. It was a stroke. Jimmy said it could've happened when she was taking a walk, reading a book, sleeping. It was just one of those things. Thank you, Frank. - Bring her home. - I thought I was taking her to Cabbot's. No, bring her home. She looks beautiful. I have to change her shoes. Why? 'Cause I'm so mad at her, I put her in these ugly... beige orthopedic shoes she hates. I have to change 'em. So... I only came by because Sam called. She sounded really upset, so I just wanted to come and make sure that she was okay, that you're both okay, that's all. Okay, we're fine. You'd be the first then. She's upstairs, you can go up. Take care of yourself, Molly. Joe... Don't. Don't. Okay. Bye. Sam? Oh. Hey. - Hey. - How are you doing? My mom went outside last night, on her own, for the first time in like three years, and it killed my grandmother. Oh... No, Sam, that's not what killed your... Well, that's how she sees it. I hope you know how to plan a good staycation, because she'll never leave this house again, like never, ever. Um, Sam... Your mom and I, we... What? It just didn't work out. Oh. I'm sorry. So... You're not staying either? No. No, I'm not. Then why are you here at all? I wanted to see if you were okay. To document? What? You get to watch without getting messy, don't you? Well, you don't get to witness us, our lives, our moments, 'cause they suck. Like, we're cursed. Sam, that is not why I'm here. - Go home, Joe. - Sam... Don't you get it? We don't want you here. - Sam. - Just leave! Go, now! Just go. Go. I have to tell her. About how you killed me? That's a terrible idea. I yelled at Joe. I heard. Do you think we're cursed? No. I think we're just alive. I yelled at your dad. The day he died. My birthday, we had a big fight. The last thing I ever said to him was mean. Why? Because he loved me, and I felt entirely unlovable that day, and I thought I had all the time in the world to make it up to him. I wouldn't let him take the car. I said I needed it, I didn't. So he rode that stupid bike. I wanted to tell you, but I just couldn't. And I'm sorry. I'll be in my room if... I'll be in my room. I told you so. Hi, sweetheart! Oh, are you okay? Of course she's not okay. How's your mother? She's doing all right. - Oh. - We won! - We finally won! - What? But not the whole thing. No, just a couple of numbers. But enough to get an upgrade to first class, or maybe a hotel suite on that trip to Moscow. - We all agree that Ivy would want you to have it. - Yes. Oh, honey, oh. Sweetheart, you take care of yourself. - Yeah, we love you. - Okay. Now we have to get out of here and let her do her thing. - Let's go. - Yeah. Don't answer that. No, I have to do it. Hello? This is Mrs. Lewis. She what? Where is she now? You didn't keep her there? She's a kid, she could be anywhere. Never mind, I'll find her. Thanks for calling. Oh, God. I have to go. Sam needs me! I need you more. What did you just say? What are you doing? - Move. - You're not well. Get out of my way. Ivy said you're sick. No. You're not real. Just forget about the outside, forget about everything, - forget about the pain. - You're not real. Molls. - You're a lie. - Is this what you want? Huh? - Okay, you're hurting me. - What kind of mother are you? You're hurting me, let me go. - If you love her, let her go. - Let me go! You're only going to mess her up. That's it. You're going to ruin her, just like you ruin everything else. You're never going to make it without Ivy. You know why? 'Cause you killed her. Yeah. If you would've stayed in the fucking house she'd still be here. There you go. It's okay, Molls. I'm here for you. I'll always be here for you. Let's just be together, like we were in Moscow. Remember that? No one's going to love you like I love you. You don't have to change anything, you don't have to be strong anymore, you don't have to love anybody. Just love me. You don't need Sam, just let her go. Get the fuck off me. Molly. Molly! So, did you find it? Sam. It's Sam. - Why can't I move? - Because you think you have to stop being afraid. You won the lotto, $10,000. Oh. I thought you'd be happier. Winning isn't the point, the point is playing the game. Now, go get our girl. Sam. It looks good. No thanks to you. Where are you going? Away. I hear it's nice there. Stop. I don't get it. How are you out here right now? I found the thing that was bigger than my fear. You. All I can tell you is that if you come home, I promise I will be there for you, always. And I plan to be available for all kinds of outdoor activities. Maybe we could start with going to an authentic Russian restaurant, and do Moscow next year? But if you do go away, or wherever you go, send me a postcard, okay? - Mom. - Yeah? Can you give this back to Gram? Grandma would want you to have it. Sam, I love you. So much. Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh. You okay? Come on, let's go home. I went to Mr. Dawson's house. The earrings belonged to his wife. How did that go? Not well. The next ten might not be so easy. I know. I need you to look up an address for me. Whose? You knock. Be shocked later, just listen now, okay? You're right, I'm not over Peter. But I don't think that I'm built to get over the people that I love and I lose. And I do want to keep living, and I do want to learn how to love again, and I do want to make space. And I know that I come with more than the usual amount of baggage, it's probably more than you can fit in an overhead compartment, but if you think that maybe your baggage and my baggage could somehow... fit, I'm here. And there's space for you. In your suitcase. Yeah. And in mine. We're kind of a package deal. I'm really sorry that I yelled at you. I didn't mean any of it. Don't answer anything now, just think about it, okay? Okay. Okay. It was a beautiful service. - Bye, Frank. - Bye, Sam. She was one of a kind. Yes, she was. It's good to see you out. It's good to be out. So, I'll, um, see you on Monday? I'll see you on Monday, Frank. - Hi. - Hi. So, I thought about it, and I like your luggage. A lot. And it matches mine, which I thought was damn near impossible. So... Hi, Joe. Hey, Sam. So I brought this. It's a picnic. Sort of a Russian picnic. - Seriously? - Yep, I got borscht, and well, it's not really borscht 'cause I didn't have the right ingredients, but it's cabbage soup. And I got three beets and vodka. Black tea for you. Thanks. And this is a picnic, right? Um, yep. And picnics are meant to be enjoyed outside? Yep. Okay.
