What's the news? What's worrying you? I put all the hard earned money in the hundi. It goes to God's Trust. Why the worry then? God is in the temple but Satya's gang's hundi is here. Come on, drop the money. I heard that Satya is a big businessman and a smuggler. He does it on big scale, these, on small scale. Vizag is reeling under their atrocities. Dolls are Rs.30/- each. They have no other business. He is the new Asst.Commissioner of police! Salute, sir. So what? He doesn't know we are Satya's men. Else he won't hit us. - Satya must come here. -He is a big shot. Everyone is a gentleman as Iong as there is no proof. I've proof. Tell him to come here. Who are you? -Satya sir's men. I wanted Satya to come. -Address him as `sir'. Be patient. Throw him into the cell. -Move. Keep politicians out. No pardon because they are Satya's men. You do your duty. Let me do, mine. Your Satya sent so many to beat up one person! Ask him to come here if he has the guts. Thought they came to hit you? No, but to watch you beaten up. You are in Vizag for 3 days. Show me how courageous you are. Let's see. Your 3 chances are up. I'll show you something which no one sees in his Iife. I'm not Satya. Look there. Father, he is the ACP. Who killed him? -Revolutionaries. Drop his body in Jagadamba Center. Sir, I'm constable Subramanyam speaking. Satya's men killed and dropped ACP's body in Jagadamba center. It is Naxalites not Satya. Are you a new recruit? Brother, will the auto come? -Ask it. I drive it. Where to go? -You tell me. Are you new here? - Right. I need accommodation too. Do I Iook Iike a broker? Anyone can tell you how strong I am. Want to check? Touch?

Move it. Get in. - Who are they? They are Satya's men. They kill those who talk about them. Those boys are college students. Rogues. Beware. Here it goes.

Planing to attract me! Do you think it's easy because you are handsome? Why don't you speak? I didn't bump into you. -Then who? Me? You tell him about me. -What? What you know of me. Around here she is... -She is What? - A rowdy. You know now. So better be careful with me. O God! There is some magic in his eyes. My hand... She put her hand on my heart! She Ioves me! I'm Iucky. - My foot. -Who is it! Who hit you? -That one with the beard. He must not know we are students. You wait here. Stop. It's their area. Let's handle it Iater. We have to handle this fellow now. He is a peace Iover. Doesn't get angry even if you hit him. Come on. How can that be? -Want to see? See, he didn't get angry. Why are they hitting him? He is not getting angry! Who hit you? -Those 4 men. He threw his shirt on the carom board. You will obey us from today. You hit our man! Don't hit my brother. Why do you hit him? Don't hit him. I touch your feet. No! Brother... Who are you? -I'm his friend. Let it go. I didn't hit him for your sake but for your family. College students don't behave Iike hooligans.

Excellent! `Pappu' is very tasty. Tomorrow bring chicken 65 or mutton fry. Food is tasty. Thanks. No need to thank his sister. Good night, brother. Is this food for me? - Yes. So, your anger was fake! Brother, Priya brought food for me. Not for you. - Then for whom? -For your friend. He already ate. You may Ieave. Ate! - She brought food! She! Who dared to bring food for you! Who was so shameless? Who insulted me! I brought the food. - You! It's okay if it's you. I took trouble to cook. I wish you eat a Iittle.

Take out money. What's wrong with him? -He has cancer. Do you really have cancer? -Yes. Even my father died of cancer. I could do nothing. Why? - I was in jail. -What for? I killed 5 people for Iying to me. Forget it. Tell me if you need anything. You are so nice! I need 2500/- for X-ray. You hate Iying. I've Rs.500. You give me Rs.2000. I Iike you for being frank. I'll help. I've to help you. He told the truth. We must help him. I wish you well. - You get the check up done for you. Why? - Your father had cancer. You might have it too. I need men Iike him. No one gives me a job. No one feeds me when I'm hungry. But he gave me money at the mention of cancer. Fool. Only trouble is he kills Iiars. That gives me tension. This drink might help me. They are okay. -Mr. Seshu, I depend on you. I must win this time too. -You will win. What's it? - We found the man who gave witness against us. Both of you handle him. You keep this money in. Stop. Where are you going! Satya's men are coming. Get in. Husband... No. Don't harm me. Come on. They are bad men. Get in. Don't hit him. Don't harm him. I beg of you. How dare he testify against Satya. Look at the consequences. Don't hurt him. Someone help... Uncle.... I beg of you. Please save him. Go up and give witness. No, don't... Husband... Satya's men killed him for being a witness against them. None of you could save him. I'd rather die than Iive amongst you. Stop. - Leave me, brother. What are you doing? - Stop. Listen to me. -I won't. Listen to me first then do as you wish. I told you everything. Die if you still want to. Is Seshu there? What is the date today? -You called to ask this! By the way, who are you? -Answer me, you... - You? Oh, you scare me! You won't be alive by the 1st of next month. Mona Iisten... He says I won't be alive by next 1st. Good story. Continue. You will know what is fear by 15th. People will know by 20th that someone has dared to fight you. Public will stop to be afraid of you by 25th. By 1st, you will be dead. Who are you? Someone called `Mass' Talking of dates. Must be a mad fellow. What's this! Wait! How dare you touch Satya's man! Take her. -Oh, you are on our side! I Iike Satya. I'm eager to meet him for Iong. Go... Go, mind your business. Come, I'll introduce you to him. Take her. 2 others are serious. One who hit them should die before they die. Go, find him. I didn't expect it from you. -What did I do? Don't act innocent. What do you imply? I'm unable to sleep. Go and Iie down. -I tried That too. What do you want me do? - Can you do me a favour?- Stand up. What's it? - I'm in love with someone. - Poor fellow! - What? - Does He know it? -I'm afraid to tell him. Forget it.- I cannot. Tell me his name. I'll speak to him. I'll close my eyes. -To take his name! It gives me courage. Okay. Go ahead. Falling in love is Iike being bitten by mosquitoes. Result for both is the same I.e. one cannot sleep. You are responsible for it. I love you. I didn't know you love me! Come close. You dog..... That bearded man will kill me if I go without X-rays. You don't need operation. I'm fine. This is okay. I cannot drink openly. No one will suspect if I drink from it. Why are you here, with saline? -Who is it? - Don't get up. I couldn't afford hospital charges. Requested doctors that I'll do it myself. Saline is injected through veins. Why is it in the mouth! Through veins is for those in initial stages of disease. I'm in the Iast stages and hence... What a thing to happen at such an young age! Did you take X-ray? -I did. I cannot see a thing. - There is nothing remained to be seen. What did the doctor say? -Gave me few days. Then... I begged him to keep me alive till Diwali. You love `Diwali'? - Yes I get up early, have bath... ...take blessings from elders Iike you, have some sweets,... ...burn some crackers,... ...Iike a flowerpot,... ...then, that night, or at dawn, Iooking at you..... I'll go bring everything you need. Such people do exist! Did you find out who beat up our men? - No, sir. Find out else father will kill you. - Sure, Sir. Leave me alone. I'm Mass speaking. Your voice sounds different. Scared for the 1st time in Iife? I told you that you will know what is fear, on 15th. You didn't take me seriously. Do it now. You will not get easy death. I'll torture you first. You are supposed to be a terror here, right? Use all your power to catch me. Now only you know there is someone who can strike you. On 20th, entire Vizag will come to know of it. Aren't you wondering who hit your men? It's me. We will come face to face on 1st. Let's settle scores then. Wait for me if you have guts. What happened? -I heard noises. It is gas cylinder blast in the neighbour's house. I suspect the mafia Ianded here to finish us. Our men got beaten up. There is a bomb blast in our house. Let's take help from ministers. -They seek our help. We Iose our control if we seek their help. Why not tell father? We must handle ourselves such small things. Do as I told you. Locate this call. Who called from here just now? -Don't know. There were many. Yes. - That was a public phone booth. A crippled isn't acceptable to my parents. They won't change. So, I took a decision. Let's commit suicide. We cannot Iive together, but can die together. Good decision but how? Jump on the rails or drown in the sea? Suicide needs Iot of courage. One percent of it is enough to achieve anything in Iife. They won't object if Sirisha's Ieg is normal, right? - Yes. Her Ieg will become normal. I'll speak to doctors. So, stop being foolish. Is it Iove? How are you? You after a Iong time! I went to steal Rs.10,000 in a house. But is turned up to be only 10. Yet, I was sent to jail. But, they served good food. One must have brains not a huge body. Look at me. There is a fool. He believes anything if it concerns cancer. He is 6 1/2 feet tall and has a huge scar on face. Killed 5 people for Iying. He is dead scared of me. I told him I've cancer and just coughed. That bird brain gave me 2000. That is not all. Next day I asked for silk clothes, sweets and... ...crackers for Diwali. He must have gone to buy those, brainless fool. When he comes next, I'll cough and ask for 3 bedroom flat. He will give it away. He has no brain at all. He is huge in size but cries when I talk of cancer. He has 4 or 5 cronies. AII are stout. Cry very easily. None of them have any brains. This is the man I consider my God. Please forgive me. Inspector, I'm 5 murders Narsimha speaking. I'm going to commit 6th murder near the buildings. You wished to die while Iooking at my face. Look at me. - Brother, Iet's beat him up first. He will notice me. Come... Come... Come. Yes. - You exercise too? It's a good habit. You have the habit too? -What are you saying! I don't feel Iike working the day I don't exercise. I slept Iate else I get up at 4 a.m. I Iike people who exercise. -I got him! They have perfect shape. -Really! Look at my shape. That's enough. Some girls wake up at 10 a.m. then sit and watch TV. I don't Iike it. Girls must wake up at dawn, exercise. Pray to God, make coffee for parents, seek their blessings. What are you doing? -Exercise. Do you expect me to believe? You sleep till 10 a.m. I've to wake you up with coffee. How come you woke up at 6 a.m. today? Mother always jokes. -It's not her but you. I get up at 10 a.m. daily. Don't you understand why I got up at 5.30 a.m.? Just say greetings! If heart beats faster.. If seen a glittering body.. It is good if you fall on my lap just like that 'A' means censor. If whistled it is once more Oh gosh! Lips are like a lollypop, hip is oh gosh! Heart would pack up at the sight of your shape! Oh dear! Don't go advance! Don't do a new dance exposing your beauty You stole my heart. Love me! Why do you stare? Oh dear! There is no joy until you shows, Come near my dear! Your front is tempting and your back is sensational! It is a new equation for the word 'fashion' Stop Ruksaana! Are your eyes Jelly fishes? Should hug you today dear! ..And let you taste the stylishness in me! Oh heartthrob! I am restless and can't leave you! None can match you Come fast, with love Get down. We are getting Iate? Don't waste time. Come back soon. Tell her to Ieave you early. We've to go to Jagadamba center. I'll take care. Go. Who are you? No. Let me go off. What happened? I'm talking to you. Atlas someone is here to hit back Satya! - Who? - Mass. Good days are here for Vizag. Satya is hunted. These were worse than Satya. They are dead. Everyone, come down. Here is a good news for you. Satya's men Kasi and Baba are dead. A man named Mass killed them. Sister, Mass killed those who killed your husband. A man named Mass killed 2 of Satya's men. Everyone say that here is a hero to fight Satya. Make away... -He is great. Has he really killed them? Who is he? Mass. - Mass! God exists. May God bless him. He will surely be blessed. I've to pray. I'll pray more. Who is he? - He came out after 2 years. His son-in-Iaw is killed a day after his wedding. He was an officer in municipality. Satya got him killed for taking objection to Iand grabbing. His daughter committed suicide the next day. Since then he prays to God for Satya's doom. Our troubles are over. Brother Mass is there to protect us. You won't have any problems too. Everyone, Ieave. Go... Go. Seshu, come inside. Sit. Tell me what happened, without fear. I've hidden something from you. Someone named Mass threatened to teach me what's fear. A bomb exploded in our house that day. I Iied to you that it was a gas cylinder blast. He challenged that public will know he is here to hit me. He killed Kasi and Baba. What else did he say? - He'll teach people not to fear us. He warned me that he will kill me on the 1st. Where does he stay? -I don't know. What does he Iook Iike? -I don't know. Why is he doing it? You don't know. Are you scared? -Not at all, father. I'm infact, waiting for that day. You are making a mistake. He did what he said he would. He will put an end to fear in people's mind for us. Place where we collect protection money from people... ...is the only place we are in contact with them. People don't fear us if our men are killed there. That's what he thinks. But he doesn't know all of us will be there too. He made my brain strain after a Iong time. We don't know where he is born, but he will die here. Brother... - Yes. -I went to temple. What's wrong? Didn't you go to hospital? - I went. I couldn't bear see Satya's men hit an old man at the temple. I warned him that people will stop fearing him from today. Take out money. Take out. Drive faster. He is going towards the bridge. Block his path. He is dead. He said he will inform us tomorrow morning. Father... -What happened? You Iet him go when you almost got him. How can you smile? According to me, he isn't dead. It's him. Now the game is exciting and interesting. I was doing all the beating. This time you attempted it. You missed me narrowly. I'm going to come face to face with you on 1st. Then, not even God can save you. Hey Mass, Satya is still alive. Hey old man, you are a crippled. How can you protect your son? God spared your one hand to Iit fire to your son's pyre. If you are a terror to others I'm a terror to you. Wait for me, if you have guts. I'd have killed him if I were not crippled. I've guided you but you could do nothing. If you are my blood, you come to me only if you kill him. Your father had never been humiliated Iike this before. Who are you? I'm asking you. It's not time for jokes. Go. I saw everything. Why were so many chasing you? I fell in love with you at first sight. I was sorry for not able to express it. Now I'm feeling bad for falling in love with you. Your presence here endangers many Iives. I'll not Iet it happen. I'll tell all right now. No one Ioses Iife because of him. You don't know him. -I know. Priya must know who you are. He is Mass. Don't be scared of me. I was a carefree person once Iike you. We have to kill him today somehow. - We cannot. Let's assign it to the person sitting next. It is Mass! What's your name? Have you come to fight? -Who told You so? I came to sing a song. -Then sing. Come on sing. - Okay. Get started Brother's walk, posture and even look is a terror His style of wearing clothes is unique The earth shakes when he gets angry No one can dare come in his path He is good to good people and bad to bad men Brother, please sing My arrival is hailed Nothing can stop me With a smile and with compassion... ...share your love, sacrifice your life for love Extend hand of friendship He saves us from all troubles He is good to good people She is beautiful She is from Dhoolpet. Follow her till Malakpet He doesn't fret about unemployment He manages to glide through Why did you come here? Go away. People won't Iet us Iive here if they find out I'm your sister. I came to wish you on birthday. I don't need your greetings. Wish me when you Ieave Satya. I won't Ieave Satya. You people come with me. You thought I'll tell my brother about you? Never. Mass is needed to fight against Satya. I'm happy for falling in love with a right man. I'm not a right person Iike you think. I still have a Iot to tell you. I'm sitting here waiting to catch you today. You would have collected alms if you sat on temple steps. Mother might hear us. Tell me when are you paying the rent. - I'm not paying. - What! People ask for time. You flatly refuse to pay! It's okay but I won't pay. My son will make you pay. You joke well. Mass is... - I know. - How? I can read Iips. Pay the rent. - I won't. I forgive mistakes once. I ask you the 2nd time. Pay the rent. - I won't. Last time. If you don't pay... You won't Iive in the room anymore. You hit me! No man has ever hit me before. You mean women used to hit you? Where is my sword? -Where is the sword? Don't go. -What's my name? - Adi. I swear that I'll kill all. What's the matter? -He is gone! Get my phone. I've to call up the Iawyer, IG and the judge to save him. What for? -He is going to commit murder. Let it go. - You say that to me! - Get Iost. Get on. We are getting Iate. -You acted well. Else my father wouldn't have Ieft you easily. You pay in time. What happened this time? I needed it somewhere else. -I'll tell your mother. Move. Adi is waiting for you outside. -He never comes here! What's the matter? -A small problem.- What's it? Satti is angry with me. He hit me. I hit back. He said he will bring goons. I said so do I. We have no goons. -I took your name. I'm only a mechanic. Here they come. Get started. Brother, wait. Take me along. Here they close in. Brother, wait. Get me now. He bragged that you are a hero. But you ran all over the town from us. I'm not a rowdy but Mass. I make you run before I hit you. That area is not sufficient. This is more spacious. Fighting with rods and swords isn't a fight. Fight with hands. Nice jokes. He isn't joking. You have not seen him yet. Show them. It isn't a coin but my mother. Keep your hands off. That is called scores. No! I told you I'll make you run. You think I'm joking? You wanted to hit him. Come here. Hit him. -No. - Hit him. Hit him. Adi is feeling shy. You give him. I'll kill those who touch Adi. Let's go. My father will bug you for rent if you wake him up. Will you pay or else should I kill you? Where is the sword? I'll kill him. Go away else he will kill you. He is an angry man Iike me. Say something else. -Good night.- That's better. What's he doing! Wife, hide the sword. Thank you God for saving. -What's the commotion? If he wakes up he will... -No way. Go sleep. It's not my mistake. Adi is responsible for it. I drank very Iittle. I said sorry. You can talk to me. Mother, I feel pained. I wanted to ask you something for Iong. I wish I had a sister. I could talk, share my feelings. It's okay. I'm hungry but no one to serve me food. I'll cry if I talk more. I'll sleep. Bye. Where is she? Don't shout. Daughter is praying. How many times do I call her for coffee. Here she is. Do your work quietly. Daughter is praying. Yes. You got scared. -Anjali, wait. I thought she is praying but she was dancing. Why don't you care to Iisten when I talk? Hold her Iike that, grandpa. Give her a kiss. Grandma, you Iook sexy. Grandpa, give her a kiss. Did she keep quiet? What happened next? - Next! Here he is. Aren't you ashamed to say so standing at the bus stop daily? You don't Iike it? I'll sit and say it. Okay? I'll complain to police. -Do it. I drank too much. Let me talk to Adi. You are sitting here? -I won't talk to you. - Why? I won't talk to you. Okay. I was depressed hence I went to temple. Met a family which increased my depression. Thought mood will improve if I drink but it got worse. Wanted to talk to you. But you don't want to. My time is bad. It's okay. I was waiting for you since morning. Don't you get it? Today is my birthday. Happy birthday. -I can see your condition. It's okay. We go to temple today. You went. We could drink together but you did it by yourself too. Don't start it again. I've nothing to give you as gift. Will you take it? You get angry if anyone even touch it. You give it to me! -To only you. Thanks, brother. But one thing. Don't ever feel you have no one. Take my advice. Early morning, get dressed and go to bus stop. Choose a girl, fall in Iove, marry, have children. Then you have wife, kids, and brother, a full family. Would any girl Iike me? -Not one but ten. 10! - Chose one of them. -The rest 9 are for you! Will you do as I said. -I'll do. - Son... - Mother woke up. -I'm going to sleep. Who troubles you everyday? -The one in the black dress. You mind your work, I'll take care of him. Go. She isn't coming today I think. I'll go to next bus stop. Do I Iook glamourous? It's new and worth Rs.1000. Good? Are you here to woo the girls? - How do you know! Do you read minds? -I know your full history. Tell me which type of girl I get and where do I find her. Come with me I'll tell you. I won't come unless I know who she is. - Come. - No. -Come. You want to know the girl. -I don't know who she is. You trouble girls at bus stop! -I don't know what you mean. - I don't know. -I'll tell you. Don't take him out. Call the girl. If she says it's me, imprison me for 10 years. I won't keep quiet. Bring the girl. Is he the one who troubled you? - It's not him. No! Look closely. -I've pointed out so clearly. You showed me! Release him. Someone troubles me at bus stop everyday. I showed him to police. He was in black dress. You must have come there in black dress. You took so much beating because of me. You should have told them. I'm responsible for it. Hope you aren't angry with me. You are very beautiful. Your eyes are very beautiful. Beware. What's her name? -Anjali. You arranged for our meeting. Is she really so beautiful! But you are beaten up badly. Painful! -It pains Where You are hit... ...Iike here. But she touched me here but it pains here. See what I told you! She is born for you. Go to then bus stop tomorrow... -I'll handle it. I want to talk personally. Hello, greetings. Me... Police station... I praised your eyes too, have you forgotten? Yes. - You should know few things about me. Why should I?- Did I ask you why when beaten up by police? So, you should agree to speak. Okay. That's better. My name is Mass. Wondering what sort of a name is it? I'll tell you. My mother was poor. Neighbours helped admit her when in Iabour. She was operated and I was born. She died. Nurse was told I've no one else. A kind doctor clicked mother's photo and... ...put me in orphanage along with the photograph. I got out when I grew up. Masses everywhere always admired whatever I did... ...Iike singing, dancing, fighting etc. I had no one to christen me. So I named myself Mass. AII of you got emotional? Let me tell you a nice things. Tendulkar in cricket, Pele in foot ball, Tyson in boxing... ...Ben Johnson in running define what's sports. Go. Maa TV, ETV, 9TV, Gemini TV are for news. Come to family relations. Parents, grandpa, grandmother... ...elder sister, younger sister, brother, aunty etc are TV serials. In movies, Amitabh Bachchan in Hindi, Rajnikant in Tamil... ...Mohanlal in Malayalam, Rajkumar in Kannada... ...and in Telugu, many. Come to seasons, summer, Rainy and winter seasons.

You say you love me and keep quiet? Thanks for touching me. We cannot say it to anyone and everyone. I said it to you. What do you people say? I must love this Mass! -Name is Mass, heart is gold. I take well care of you. I'll wait for 2 days for your reply. Think well. I've to tell my mother. I've to tell you something. I feel shy to tell. I'm in love with a girl. I told her so. But wonder if she accepts me. You have to take care of it. Thank you, mother. What a dream! I must tell Anjali. He has come again. I told mother about us, in the dream. She okayed. - What! - It's our 1st Iove. I had a great dream. We got married and had twins within an year. Boys name is Raghava, girls' name is Raghavi. Didn't you Iike it. Let's choose some other names. We both must Iike the names. Sit and think. You can tell me Iater. Bye friends, bye Anjali. I haven't said I love him! He is talking of kids, names! Did you Iike the names? I went to play. Don't hit him. He is a kid. I said no. -Who are You to tell me. If he doesn't study, he will become Iike you. You are an orphan, a wayward. Should I Iet him do as he pleases? Talk. You hold me by my collar? He is my son. I'll do what I please. Who are you to ask? I'll kill you. - Adi, stop. -What did You say? He knows the value of family as he doesn't have one. You don't know because you have it. Don't ever say he has no one. I'm there for him. Don't bother. -He is drunk. Forget him. Bloody drunkard. -You got angry too! That's why I told you to marry soon. You can shut them up. -Smile please. Enough.- Eat more. - I'll become Iike you.-Then Ieave it. Chutney? I'll serve. Ghee? I'll serve. Pay the rent.- Enough of drama. He paid yesterday. I paid. - I'm asking for next months rent. Why are you taking it away. -These are For tomorrow. Put it back else I'll serve them to you tomorrow. I couldn't find out all three of you are together. Every month he refuses to pay. I complain to you. You chase him with a sword. I ask your mother to call up Iawyer. She refuses. You always shut me up. You could have told me the truth. Touching my feet for the mistake? - No. Then? - For marrying you. I'm coming... I've some important thing to say. Wait for 5 minutes. Listen carefully especially the boys. This is my Iife's... I won't honk again. -Good. Why is the traffic jam? Anyone can love anyone. I bless you all. He came with a mike.- Let him make his announcements. He will come to me. Now about me. That girl's name is Anjali. I love her. -See I told you. I'm warning you politely that,... ...no one dare Iook at her. You came at the right time. Arrest him. I should put him in Iock up because you say so! Then you deny it. He shouts at me. Orders me to fix a date for wedding. Do I have to go through it? You may proceed. Okay. - May I clear the traffic? - You may. Police won't even bother. -Leave It For now. I've brought flower for you. - Hey, you... I spent Rs.200/- for mike, stopped traffic, announced,... ...and you come to profess Iove! I'm much senior to you. I'm in love with her for Iong. Oh, it's you. I got her because of you. Thanks. You may Ieave now. -How dare You say so? Stop it. - Say so. I'll Ieave. -Good. They are fighting. -Go and stop them. Bus isn't coming in time. He is villain and I'm hero. You are supposed to say you love me when I hit him. What do you think of yourself? I said sorry for my mistake. You must Iet it go. No. You came to me, tell me about your name. You talk of dreams, kids, telling your mother etc. Dare ask me to suggest names for kids too! Now you use mike to tease me. If I keep quiet, you'll print it in papers, announce on TV. Idea of newspaper and TV is good! Why didn't it strike me? Thanks for touching my cheek. What do you think of yourself? -What are you going on about? -That you love me. I'll never love you. - You will. - Never. -I'll see to it. I won't in this Iife. Are you sure? - Of course. Be with me for an hour to prove yourself. What will you do? I won't interfere yet you love me. What if I don't. I'll not show my face again. - Really? Will you go with him? -Do You have any problem? I'll miss my class but can get rid of him forever. What do I do? Get on that bus. Come on. Get in. Do you expect me to say you Iook beautiful even when angry? You really are beautiful. It's only for an hour. Cannot you keep smiling? Look at the chubby cheeks Look at the hair like dark clouds Wow! What a hair style! O Beauty with bewitching eyes Love for you ruined me Forget anger, quit tantrums and love me I don't know what happened to me after I met you Everything seems strange I feel restless if I don't see you Everything looks rosy when I'm with you Give me a place in your heart.

Say yes to him He is tall and handsome. Agree If she comes my way,... ...I'll fill her path with petals of Marigold flowers ...to make it soothing for her tender feet If she comes into my Iife I'll protect her... ...from evil eyes None of you must have seen a good guy Iike me Why not you tell her the same once Agree that you belong to me, now, right here. Give me a pack. 45 minutes are already over. 15 minutes are still to go. Don't rush. Brother, you have not come here for Iong. I came only Iast week. These are my friends. Greet her. - Greetings. Who is that girl? -Sister-in-Iaw.- Sis-in-Iaw! Who and whose sister-in-Iaw? Who said so? Don't get upset. You won't become one by their saying. You are confident of yourself, right? They were joking. Distribute it to them. How is this enough for so many kids? I had only that much money. -Brother, move aside. Quantity is immaterial. Feeling behind it counts. We have no one. Would you visit us... ...along with brother, once a while? I'll come. Everyone calls us orphans. -What Does That mean? That means you are `Children of the God' I'm an orphan too. Offer me too. Children, go play. Do you know why I brought you here? This place is Iike a temple. No one Iies here. Now tell me whether you Iike me. I won't come to college. -Why? - He disturbs me a Iot. I won't come. - Does that mean you love him? Did I say so? -I can understand. Let's go, have tea. -Let's go. Are you the boy in love with Anjali? Did she send love Ietter? Are you afraid that Mass will come? He won't. I told my brother and they must have broken his Iimbs. Your brother is a goon. I don't Iike it. Call him to stop it. O God! - What's it? My brother has brought Mass. Why did my brother fall down? Brother. I'll not be called a man if I don't beat them up. So is the case if I don't fulfil the wish of my beloved. You want me get hurt, bleed, right? Please, don't do it. You wanted me get hurt and bleed. Are you happy now? Understand me atleast now. How is he? - Wait. It's Iate. Let's come tomorrow. Your grandparents must be worried. Let's go. I'll not go home until I know he is out of danger. We are Iate. He is...- He is fine. You can go, see him. How dare you kiss someone on the road? Don't stare. Wondering how we knew it? He saw it. Forgive me, grandpa. I love him. I'll marry him. Gift is nice. -Sister-in-Iaw Gave it. Sister-in-Iaw! -Yes, Sister-in-Iaw. Wait. Brother is coming in. Let's go up. -I'll be here. Mother, it's her. Is she nice? I'm very Iucky. -What for? Parents get to christen their children. I could do it even as a beloved. From today, your name is Ganesh. I tell him all my problem till now. Henceforth, I'll tell to this Ganesh. Change your style now. Greetings, brother Ganesh. -Have You heard it? Anjali, he is Adi. -Let me tell her. I'm Ganesh's brother. -Do You Iike the name I chose? Your names and your pair both are good. But not the affair. - What? Marriage only after graduation. Wait for an year! No. Wedding is tomorrow. Tomorrow! No way. We must enjoy Iike other Iovers. We must roam on bike, go to movies, share icecreams etc.etc. Isn't it? She was joking. I'm serious.

You are overjoyed that granddaughter is going with you. She comes there only for studies. Anything goes wrong... You know me. Okay. I fell in love with you the day you said you love me. But kept you away for fear of my brother and father. None of them can do anything. They can do nothing once we are married. You are an orphan. I've a family yet an orphan. I want you. My brother is getting married. Everyone must come. Who is your brother? -Who is he! Watch it. He is dashing, his looks are infectious He is handsome.

We will wait for you. - Come in. - Where is Anjali? -I don't know. - What happened? -We know nothing. Trust us. - She went to temple to get married. You have no Ioyalty as much as a servant has. Father will kill you if he comes to know of it. Your duty here is over. Let's go. Mother, I forgot you. Come with me. -Let Go off me please. Brother, Iet go off me. Sister-in-Iaw! Who are you? Leave her. Adi, you go away. Brother, don't hurt him. Don't Ieave him. You proceed. Sister-in-Iaw... Catch him. Leave me and run. No... Brother, don't. Leave him. I'll come away with you.

Don't ever say you have no one. I'm there for you. I won't Ieave anyone who raises hand on Adi. I didn't want you people know of my sorrow. I kept smiling all the time. 1st is 3 days away. That day is the day for Adi's Iast rites. Satya dies here. Since then you haven't met her? -No. I'm going to meet her at a wedding of Satya's relative. Anjali will come there surely. What if they spot you? -They don't know me. I wish you and Anjali unite. I love my brother deeply. You are Iike fire in Vizag. I Iit, your cigarette. Anyway, your hair style is nice. Who is it? I went to her wedding too. Take me away. I cannot stay here after I met you. I'll come and take you on 1st. Will you come away with me I'll give my life for you Will you come with me"? I'll come with you... ...if you keep me in your heart I'll be your companion at every step. Will you come? Marry me Then I'll come with you I'll bring down the sky for you. Will you come? Come to me O my beautiful girl Take me away stealthily. I'm your girl You are my every desire You are the definition of my love You are my breath All my eyes dream of is, you You are my eyes My body is burning with desire O my dream girl come with me Let us get engaged and then get married Your lips are sweet Let's unite Let the love take over Let your body quiver wish that day comes soon Don't be hasty let the right time come I'm unable to control my youth No need to feel shy. Come to me my beloved Let me make you wait Mass says he came to the wedding. Said my suit is nice. He spoke to my sister and kissed her too. What were you doing? -We didn't know who he was. You don't know! - Tension won't serve the purpose. Take your father's advice. I've to speak to father. -About What? - Mass. What will you talk? He told you to come to him only after killing Mass. If you go for advice again, he will kill you. I know him better than you. There is a Iawyer who advises your father. He is Durgaprasad. Sent for him. Be seated. My men told you all. - No. I want to hear it from you. Someone is torturing me. -His name is Mass. I can seek high Ievel minister's help. Because you know you will Iose your reputation. I want to know who he is. Tell me about your competitors. Be truthful and don't hide anything. A Bombay party sent me money recently. But I didn't send the goods. -It Cannot be them. Tell me about your family. You know everything. Why did you bring back your sister suddenly? That's not important. Leave it. What happened? - I told you to tell me everything. My sister Ioved someone. I didn't Iike it. Killed his friend who obstructed us. When did you bring her? -4 weeks ago. He is Mass. -He is Not capable of it. People with background fear Ioss of possessions or Iife. But Mass has no such fear. Friendship is dear to him. You don't know the power of friendship. He Ianded in Vizag the next day you killed his friend. Took a week to enquire about you. Then started to threaten you. Ask your sister. I challenge she cannot deny. Go. What's the name of the boy you Iove.... I'm asking you. Shocked! Because I chose someone of your stature? Take care of her. No worry. I don't do things Iike starving or running away. I know Mass. He will come to take me. So, I won't go anywhere. He is Mass, Iike you said. She couldn't describe him. I'll go to Hyderabad and show my power. He is in Vizag. His attack is well planned. I doubt he Ieft clues Ieading to him in Hyderabad. Search for him here. When did he speak to you Iast? Yesterday. -What did He say? That he came to my cousin's marriage. Said he spoke to Anjali. However intelligent one may be, makes a mistake. Mass made a mistake.It is, telling you of his visit. Get video cassette of the wedding. You can find him. He is Mass. Sir, I know where he stays. He eluded you till now. I know what you will do if you catch him. What's the commotion? Let's ask them. Stop it. Please spare us. What have we done? I want him. -What has He done? He is not Mass but Ganesh. We all know him well. He is Ganesh. Stays in our building. Tell them. -He is Ganesh. -Priya, tell them. Tell us where is he. Everyone keep quiet. Where is he? -I don't know. - Tell me. She is my sister. -So What? Do I spare her? She knows nothing. Why do you hit our men? I won't spare anyone. I want Mass. Talk. Why do you hit us? He is not Mass. He is my brother Ganesh. He is Iike a God. Then you may worship him. Talk. Brother... Take them into the vehicle. Let go off me. Let's go. This is all because of Ganesh. He Iied about his name. Yes. - Our mistake is to Iet him Iive here. Yes. -Don't blame him. He won't cause us trouble. He too is a victim of Satya. You were sorry for me. He will come here for these people. I'll kill him infront of your eyes. Shocked? - Brother... -Want me release them? Mass took away our father. I still feel sorry for you, brother. What is it? Feel Iike killing me? You would have, if your Iimbs are okay, right? These people will kill you if I say so. But I won't Iet you die because,... ...you should watch your son beaten up by me. You don't know me. Think you are great! I made you and your son piss in pants for a month. My Seshu didn't not find you. Aren't you ashamed to say it? You claim you have control over entire Vizag. What could you do? I did as I told. I came on 1st as I told. Call your son. I'll teach him a Iesson. Go. Kill him and... Get up Mass. You can hit back. Come on. Will he get up by your saying? Call him. Tell him to get up. You come Iike a coward in my absence and take away women? You call yourself a man? You give 3 chances, I believe. I give you a chance. Pick it up and come. Second chance. Come on. Didn't you think of your mother when you kicked a pregnant girl? You are so scared of death! How can you kill others? Come to my help. -Wait. I was ready to sacrifice my Iife but he... ...didn't care when it came to my sister. He will do the same to you. Don't help him. You are scared. Now Iast and equal chance for both of us. Both of us are at equal distance from death. Try if you have guts. You have killed my only friend, Adi, unnecessarily. Kill him.... I won't kill you but Iet you Iive Iike a vegetable. I've seen a true man after a Iong time. One Ioses the post if he Ioses in politics. But you die if you Iose as a rowdy
