YEAR 2003 You really like it so much? We need a bigger tank. This one is too small. Okay. I'll get you a bigger one. We're pulling out. But we're almost done. Just take your men and leave. YEAR 2023 Wear your uniform. All right. Dad, what's up? Where are you? Outside. How was it? Did you get in? No. Don't worry, you can try next year. I graduate this year! I'm sorry. Forget it. Mom! Madam Chan. Bo Seng, I just met with the board. Is the breakdown report done? It's in progress, it will be ready soon. What are your men doing? There shouldn't be any issues in the first place. I'm sorry. We are addressing it now. Enough breakdowns. Get to the bottom of this and make sure it doesn't happen again! Okay. We're trying our best. Trying isn't good enough! Get it done! Understood? Understood. The top brass just had a board meeting. This morning's incident didn't sit well with them. If it's always the same problem, why is there no solution? It's usually the gray line. Yours is not any better. It's not about any line. Heng. Do you have any suggestion? Sir, our system is automated. Even if there are flaws in the system, they will be overwritten... So you are saying the system is the problem? Yes. Our system needs to be renewed. The train frequencies have been increasing. In my opinion, we should increase the maintenance budget. That's not an option. With the new lines opening up, budgets are tight. I know. But we shouldn't neglect our current lines. Will a system renewal solve our problems? At least it will be better. It's been a while since we renewed our system. Does everyone agree? All right, let me think about it. Heng, in the meantime, no more breakdowns. All right? Mom. Did you eat? Yes. Lucas. Get your bag, let's go home. Don't you want to stay a little? It's late. Hold on. Take a look. It could help Lucas. He's been like that since the accident. He needs professional help. It has been tough for you. I'm fine. Let's go. Closing station three. Thank you, Control. Everything okay? Only one train is two minutes behind. You don't have to pick me up. Just wait for me at home. I said, I can... I said I can get home by bus. Okay. Bye-bye. See you tonight. Another breakdown? Hello? CL41, this is Control. How may I assist you? Control, is 1152 coming in? Yes. It's two minutes late. We seem to have lost its signal. That's strange. Calvin. This is the duty supervisor. We have lost the signal for 1152. Its signal is normal here. It should be in by now. There's no train here. One moment. What's going on? The train was two minutes behind schedule. Its signal disappeared here. The last train didn't stop. It just went on. We have a situation. The signal is normal, but the train is not at the station. Take a look at the log for the last ten minutes. Lucas, come back. Quickly. Lucas! Give me the footage of 1152 at every station before CL41. Pull up this window. Strange. No train has ever disappeared due to a signal flaw. - I need a clear image. - Okay. Play it again. I'll leave him to you. Lucas? Are you okay? Are you hurt? You're all right? Easy. Again. Shut down the tracks. Send our ground staff to search. Don't stop until it's found! Supervisor here. Can you stay here for a while? Don't use that. I just need these. You can help the rest. Hey, I am injured too. Hey! That's it? Done. Everybody is taken care of. What else can I do? Take a break. Control should be aware by now. I think... help is on the way. You seem to know a lot about the train system. Found anything? No. It's impossible. An entire train vanished into thin air. The junction! Damn it. How long are we gonna be stuck here? Hey, Uncle. Chill. You have to calm down. Calm down? How can I calm down? What are you doing? I knew it. Nothing works here. Being smart is good. You're just not that smart. Instead of just talking, why don't you try? The door is open? Why didn't you open it before? I didn't feel hot. What's wrong with young people these days? You're the problem, old man. Who are you calling old? Just wait here. Help should be here any minute. Okay. Stay here all you want. I'm leaving. I need some air. I don't want to be stuck here with you guys. Hey, old man. Take a flashlight. Phones have flashlights. Don't you know that? Who is old here? MAINTENANCE - CONTACTING THE TRAIN... We have searched all four lines. - It doesn't make sense. - Guys, look. CL40 and 41 are about two kilometers away from each other. Where could it possibly be? Pull up the construction maps. You think it could've gone into the closed lines? We need to report this. We don't know how many people are in the train. - We can't leave them there. - It could also be empty. Stop making a fuss. Even if we don't report it now, they'll still know from the system log... I said wait! Wait! I'm in charge here. We will wait! Sir, we have a situation. Who's there? Don't scare me. How could a train vanish into thin air? Did it go into a closed line? It's the system's overwrite. When the system can't read a signal, it will automatically find an alternate route. Sarah. These are the new lines. If the original signal can't be found, the system will look for a new line automatically, and the train will run on the new line until it reaches the next station. So which new line is it on now? Not necessarily a new line. Could be an old line too. But in theory, no matter which line the system chooses, the train will stop at the next station and wait for instructions. It will stop even at dead ends. Have we searched all possible lines? We're searching. It's still missing. Missing. It's still missing even now. Which line is this? What is this flawed system? Flaws everywhere. We have been using this system for years. Why is the system designed this way? You all knew there were flaws. Yet no one can explain why? Sir. You wanted it to be efficient. The budget is too low, but the demands on us are so high. How can we make it work? The director is just doing his job. Just like us. Who's down there right now? Our ground engineers are still searching. - And also the maintenance team. - No, I mean passengers. We're not sure yet. But we have the footage of the train before it disappeared. You seem experienced in first aid. Are you a doctor? I used to be a nurse in the emergency unit. Used to be? I changed my job. Are you still in school? Yes. Junior college. That used to be the best time of my life. Really? I feel for me it's the worst. No matter whether it's the best or the worst... it will pass. Help me! Hey! Hey! Help me! Quickly! Pull me up! Quickly! - Close the door! - Close it! Be careful. I'll handle it. Janice, get the first aid kit. Lucas! No! What happened? The maps are incomplete. - There was a track running here. - The old hospital demolished last year? - Yes. - There is a line underneath? That was 20 years ago. The line was almost complete. But it was abruptly interrupted. It has since been abandoned. Could the train... be there? Don't ever... open that door. Something's out there. Run! Quickly! Help! Open the door! Let's go! What is the protocol for this? What protocol? This has never happened before. What station is this? The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please try again later. The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please try again later. That thing just now, did you see it? I thought I was crazy. What's that thing doing in the subway? Why did... Whatever that thing is, why did it keep looking at Lucas? Lucas, tell me. Do you have any food on you? What's in your pocket? Check. Let's keep going. Right. I agree. Let's keep going. There should be another station ahead. Are you okay? Can you walk? I know you're worried about this blowing up. If we keep stalling, how will we explain it to Legal? I don't mind losing a multi-million dollar train. I'm more worried about the passengers on board. Find them. Deploy all the resources for the rescue. I will call the armed forces for help. Got it. Madam Chan. I can't send a rescue team without precise information about the incident. We'll be fine. Sorry. I'm just a little shaken. Your kid is so cool. Other kids in this situation... would've been too scared, even hysterical. He's been through an accident. I was driving... and hit a barricade. The car flipped three times before it stopped. I lost my husband in the accident. We were lucky to survive. Nothing can compare... to the fear he felt then. It must have been tough for you... to raise him alone. With him around... I'm not scared. Right. I understand. Okay. Let's keep moving. Run! Run! Dad. Mom! Wait. Don't go after that thing. You're not doing anything? Calm down. I can get a proper rescue team. But come up with me. I can request help then. Don't bother. There is no signal here. Hello? Anybody there? We need assistance. Hello? Anybody there? We need help down here! Stop it, just come with me. Everyone else on the train is dead. What about them? Where is the train? Enough! If you really want to help them, come up with me. I'm trying to solve this. Can't you just listen? Don't you know how much you matter to me? You are my only daughter. Come with me. I promise. I will rescue them. All right? Why did you try to fight it instead of running? I wasn't thinking. If anything happens to you, what will I do? If everyone in that train had died, what would you have done? I'm here now, right? You're here because it's your job. I've been trying hard. But no matter what I do, you just... Forget it. We'll talk when we get out. When we get up there, the radio should work. Go. Go now. Climb up. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Hello? This is Control. Over. Hello? Hello? Hello? This is Control. Where are you? Madam Chan. We have a situation. One of our men is down there. He may be in danger. Who is it? Mr. Wong. He went into the tunnels and lost contact. We need a rescue team down there now. Mom! Lucas! Lucas, please come down. Come down. I'm here, don't be scared. Come. Are you hurt? - Are you hurt? - I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine, really. What a relief. Look. Nothing... can take him away from me. Not that accident. And certainly not you. You'll let us pass! Come on! Stop that! You can't protect your children. You are no mother. Mom! Don't come out. Lucas... You'll be all right. We will be all right. I will protect you. You will be all right. Lucas? There's someone here! Survivors! A mother and child! Your deposition is done. You can speak to him now. Did you hear about the survivors? The mother and son? I just know they burnt the entire tunnel. They've classified it as a gas leak incident.
