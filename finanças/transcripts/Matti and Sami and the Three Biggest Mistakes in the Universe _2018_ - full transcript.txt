Summer vacation. I'm in Finland. For the very first time in my life. Everything is just the way I imagined it. That's my brother Sami. He's five. He wanted to stay in Germany with his frog friend from kindergarten, but now he's happy to be here too. As you can hear. Sami only does that when he's really pleased. When are we going home? I want to see Timo! That's Mama. In Finland she can relax and escape the stress her boss causes her. 1 think Finland will help Mama see the nice side of life. And that's Sulo, my papa. He's a genuine Finn. Here, Papa doesn't have to drive a bus. He can finally be a games developer. Everything is perfect and this could turn out to be the best summer ever. What were you thinking, Matti? Where are we supposed to sleep? We have no money. We have no car. The next village is ten kilometers away. - Four and a half, the guidebook says. I'm Matti, by the way. I'm ten. Apparently it's my fault we're stuck in Finland. But I'm not so sure that's true. I was just trying to put the universe in order. MATTI AND SAMI AND THE UNIVERSE'S THREE GREAT MISTAKES Everything began one Saturday a few months ago. Papa, have you heard? Swisher is coming! A real dolphin! Matti, read it out! "Because the zoo has too many dolphins Mayor Meyer has offered a home in our town to one of the many excess dolphins. At 10 am Swisher will move in to our duck pond." We need a present! Won't Swisher be sad living in our pond? No, our duck pond is much bigger than Swisher's old aquarium. It'll be fun for him. Sami, leave that be. It's for Swisher! - Dolphins don't eat pickled herrings. You're not coming? I have a class. Oh, come on, honey! The three of us will have fun, yeah? Behave yourselves, boys. I want Swisher! Sami, get off the railing. - Then I can't see! Oh, stop your whining. - Sami! That's a Turkish name, isn't it? You don't look like you're a Turk. Sami is also a Finnish name. Do you know the soccer player Sami Hyypia? No. Everyone knows him in Finland. Matti! Leave the lady in peace. Excuse us. But she... Gernot, I think it's time for us to go. It's getting rather too... crowded here. When is the dolphin coming? A dolphin? Here in our duck pond? Don't you know that today is April 1st? Who's dumb enough to fall for that? Swisher not showing up was pretty bad. But the real problem was much bigger than that. Oh, Sulo, the dolphin story was an April Fool's joke. I know. - You knew? Of course. - Why didn't you say? Can you imagine what I've had to put up with all afternoon? The Dolphin Lie was the universe's first great mistake. It got everything all mixed up. And when the universe gets mixed up terrible things can happen. The planets can go out of orbit and crash into each other. Others get lost in the depths of space. In the worst case, the sun gets extinguished. I doubt that it's easy to set the sun alight again. Sulo, can you pick Sami up from kindergarten? I have a double shift. No, Sulo! I have a first-aid course. I can't get away early. And I have a double shift. - Just great! Man! Mama? There. It's gone now. Don't worry. I can ask Uncle Kurt to pick up Sami and I'll take care of him. My big boy! That's Turo, my best friend. Terve, Sulo! Turo is half Finnish, like me, Terve, Matti! - Terve, Turo. We were in kindergarten. Oh, what's with your arm? Oh, nothing much. My family and I went mountain biking. They don't just mountain bike. I got you something. - What? Every year his family go on vacation to Finland. This came in the mail. I'd never been there. You say it "Kokkola jah imparistto." Kokkola and its surroundings. That's where our vacation house is. Look. Here's a photo of it. You can see the tip of our boat. You have a speed boat? - No. A row boat. We go out fishing on the lake every day. Oh, Turo! I really want to go to Finland. It's vacation soon. Come with us. I'm sure my parents wouldn't mind. Yeah, and we'll take my mama and papa too! Our vacation house has plenty of room for everyone. Hey, you slapheads from Slapland, want a slap? How many times? Good morning, Olivia! Matti, it'd be so cool if that worked out. Ask your parents tonight, yeah? Yeah, I'll do that. Good morning, children. - Good morning, Ms. Thiele. A little more oomph. Good morning, Ms. Thiele! Very nice. Ready to go, Matti? - Sure am, Uncle Kurt! Oh, we have to get Sami from kindergarten. - Roger! We can do that! A dolphin in the pond? That's pretty hard to imagine. It was in the newspaper! It was a big, fat lie. I mean, Sami was so looking forward to it. Things like that have to be put right again. Who decides what's right? You just know it. People can have different opinions. - Baloney! Of course! For example, one person thinks it's right to fly to the moon, but someone else thinks that it's wrong and believes we should explore the deep sea instead. It's hard to know what's wrong and right. - I know right away. Everything would be fine if the paper hadn't lied. Don't take the dolphin story to heart. Adults lie now and then. Hey, it was a pretty funny April Fool's joke, right? An April Fool's joke about dolphins isn't funny! Sami, can't you give up the bad mood? Not until we have a dolphin in our pond. Irrawaddy dolphins don't dive for long. They come to the surface to breathe around once a minute. The WWF estimates that only 85 individuals remain in the Mekong River. Please donate to stop the Irrawaddy dolphin dying out. Matti, we have to help the dolphin, or it'll die! Nobody's going to die. Mama and Papa donate money every month for animals with problems. What is donating? Mmm... It's like making a payment. Hey, sweeties! Did you have a good day? - Uh-huh. Where's Papa? - In his study, I think. Living in this house is driving me crazy! Sulo Pekkanen, didn't it occur to you to wash the dishes? Annette, I have to work. - Sulo, I need your help. How can I manage all alone? - Please! I have to concentrate. I've just about had enough of... Mama. - What's that? I've had an idea. Tell your father about it. He needs some ideas. Hey, are you working on a new game? WIN A DREAM HOME IN SCANDINAVIA And are you making good progress? What's up, Matti? Look at this. How about we vacation in Finland? Ask your mother. So how was your first-aid thingamajig? Don't ask. If we're not quick enough, Dr. Casper screams at everyone. Maybe we all need a vacation. Oh, yes! It'd be great to get away from here. We could all go to Finland together this summer. Oh, Matti, we can't afford a vacation. No, it isn't expensive. This is Turo's parents' house. He said... - Matti! I'm exhausted. I can't discuss anything right now. Okay? Mama? Yes? How much money do you donate to the animals? The man on TV said dolphins are dying out so I told Sami you donate money to help animals. Hey, honey! Don't worry. We give them so much money they'll be fine forever. Matti... do you really think we donate money every month? We only told you that so that you'd stop worrying about the animals. A little fib is okay if it's well meant, right? Matti? Are you okay? "All of them are on the Red List of Threatened Species." The Donating Lie was the universe's second great mistake. And it was much worse than the first one. Now it wasn't only about Swisher, this affected all dolphins. And if 300,000 of them really die every year, in all that time, that would be... An awful lot of animals! When Sami is as old as I am now, there might not be any dolphins left. His world would crumble. 1 had to think of something. And I knew what. Hey! We're not allowed to take Mama and Papa's pizza money jar! You'll be in trouble! - I don't think so. They forgot to donate for the animals. Hungry dolphins are more important than pizza, right? That's 37 euros and 30 cents. If you want to donate, your parents have to come too. We need an adult to sign the donation form. I'm sorry. - Please! It's for "Save the Animals.” - That show still exists? I used to watch that when I was little. The poor dolphins are going to die! They're all going to die! Okay, boys, it's done. - Awesome. Say hi to the dolphins. I'll do that. Matti, will she really give the money to the dolphins? Oh, don't be silly. She won't take it herself. But she'll make sure it gets there. All right, but what about the dolphin in our duck pond? Now there's a dolphin in our pond after all. And no one knows about it except us. And you can't tell anyone. Swear to it. I swear. I won't let anyone tell me it's hard to know what's wrong and what's right. 1 think mistakes the universe makes can be fixed. You just have to know how. Ew! Sami! You sure look pretty. You think so? Thank you. Mama, Matti, come see! Are those pirogi from Finland? So delicious, Sulo! Jussi will love them. Jussi? You mean Uncle Jussi from Finland? He's paying us a surprise visit this evening. Already? I'm not even ready yet! Terve, Matti. Terve, Sami. He asked if you have a sauna here. The tough guy is Jussi. And I'm Marja, your aunt. Your sons don't speak Finnish. There's no sauna. Still think you're areal Finn? Your uncle is a real jatka. - Yeah. What is a jatkad? A really strong man who works in the forest. That's right. Have you ever heard the story of how your father burned down the warehouse in Kokkola? No one wants to hear that. We do! Tell us! - Tell us, tell us! Tell us! - Okay, okay. As children, we used to help out at old man Makinen's lumberyard. Your father used to sneak into the warehouse to smoke cigarettes. But this one time, he just wasn't careful enough. He threw a match onto a pile of wood shavings. And... boom! The whole lumberyard went sky high! Back then I thought that I'd never get another job in Kokkola as long as I live. But now old Mékinen has passed on the lumberyard business to me. What? - Yeah. I'm going to be the manager of the lumberyard. That's... That's tremendous! Yeah. - Why didn't you...? I wanted to surprise you. I also have an important announcement to make. A cell phone company has offered me a job. We're moving. What? We're moving? Where to? Switzerland! Switzerland? Yes, indeed. We're moving when summer vacation starts. We'll live in a big house right by the lake. Sulo! Zurich. ReuRB. Sursee. Burgdorf. Berne... Three, two, one, and... Stop! Matti, you're not writing a novel. Would anyone like to read theirs? - Me! Me! Come to the front then, Matti. What is Changing in My Life, by Matti Pekkanen. "Everything. We are moving to Switzerland. We will live by a lake. Papa is a real computer game developer and Mama will find a new office. She won't have stress with her boss. The house is so big that Sami and I will each have our own room. We won't fight anymore. The most important thing is that our family is happy. In the evenings we'll eat dinner by the lake and watch the sun set." That's it. You moving is really crappy. I might never see you again. We can still visit each other. - Once a year maybe. And what about Finland? Mama said we can't afford the flight. You have to ask them again. If you're moving, it's even more important for us to spend vacation together. Yes, I will. Can you explain this to me? How long have you been taking our money? - It's not yours. What? - You lied. You said you were donating money to the animals. I did what you promised you were doing. Does everyone here do as he pleases? Are you stressed out because of work? I wish that was it. I'm stressed out because of your father and his story about the house by the lake. What about the house? Matti... Your father made up the whole thing with the house. We're not moving. How do you know that? - Because he told me the truth. Why would Papa make that up? What do I know? To prove he's a big jatka like Jussi. Papa's Switzerland Lie was the universe's third great mistake. It was worst of all. Okay, okay! - Listen to what I'm saying! It's not acceptable! - Yes, yes. No! I... I don't know. I don't know either! Matti. - What do you want? Can I come in your bed? - Come on. I don't want Mama and Papa to get divorced. We'll have to go to a home. Like Moritz from kindergarten. What are you talking about? Mama and Papa love each other. Yeah? Of course. Look. Up there is the Earth. Our planet. For millions of years it's been spinning in our galaxy, orbiting the sun. What's that? That? That's an astronaut. He's floating alone in space, doing research. His spaceship is close by. When he goes back, all his friends will be there. They've been looking after him the whole time. Everything is in the right order. The rings of Saturn orbit their planet at the same distance. Things like that never change. That's certain. Hey, Sami. Matti... We have to talk. - We sure do. So... it wasn't right to take the pizza money. What? We have other things to talk about! What about the house in Switzerland? We'll talk about that another time, but, here, this is for you both. You can donate that too. To mark this special occasion... we will dedicate today... to a special topic. Switzerland! Oh, gosh, where is it? Here. I'm sure you can tell us where you're moving to. Zurich. - Zurich! It's a delightful city! I was there years ago. I'll tell you some things you have to see! Switzerland is known for its many languages... Uncle Kurt... If you tell a lie but then tell the truth afterwards is that still just as bad? Lies grow quicker than bamboo. Lies grow so thick and fast you can't see where they're going. What have you been up to? - Me? Nothing. Papa told a lie. And now Mama is really mad. I'm sorry. What can I do to make everything all right again? You can't always make things right. The world is too complicated. Matti, your parents have to sort it out. But how? They're hardly speaking to one another! Let things run their course. It doesn't mean it will all turn out bad. Hey, don't step on the dead guys! Mama said you'd play with me when you get home from school. Maybe Uncle Kurt was right. You can't fix everything in the universe. The actual universe is much too big. And just because things weren't looking so good for us didn't mean everything had to end up terribly. In the end things might turn out better than you expect. I know why you're in a bad mood. What? - Because we're not getting a new house. We just have to win one, like Timo's mama. She won a new TV. Sami, you're a genius! WIN A DREAM HOME IN SCANDINAVIA Win your dream home in Denmark, Sweden, Norway... Finland! Fifty euros! We're going to the bank to win a house. A house? - Yes. Man, it was your idea! Papa gave us that for the animals. He'll be so pleased! It'll be a fantastic surprise! Come on. Now! But, Sami... A surprise is no fun if someone lets on beforehand. Promise me you won't tell Mama and Papa. I swear. Going to the playground? Don't forget, dinner is at six. Not one minute later. All right. Only adults may take part. But the adults aren't allowed to know or it won't be a surprise. I'm sorry. I have to abide by the rules. But... - Next, please! Run along, now. There's no point anyway. Wait here a minute. I'll be right back. What's up? I'm your uncle, not your dad. - The man in the bank doesn't know. Sorry, that's going too far. - Please! No, Matti. Know what your mom would do to me? You have to ask your parents. Maybe they'll buy you a ticket. I'll drive you home. How am I supposed to do that? I can't ask Papa. He's never there. And I can't ask Mama. She doesn't know Papa took money from the pizza jar. What do you think will happen if she finds out? Matti, stop. - Want things to get worse? Okay. Listen to me. I'll do it for you. But I want you to know that it is a lottery. Only one, single person can win it. That money would be better off elsewhere. Did Papa really take the money from the pizza jar? No, he didn't. But you said... - So that Uncle Kurt would help us. Then you lied! - Yeah, I did... But Mama says a little fib is okay if it's well meant. All aboard! Thank you very much, Mr... Pekkanen. Have a nice day. - Thank you. Come on. Uncle Kurt? Thank you. Okay. Papa's house by the lake was made up. But if my ticket won the draw, we would have one anyway. Papa could keep his promise and Mama would no longer be mad at him. The universe would immediately be back in order. And because the house would be in Finland, not Switzerland, we could all go on vacation together. "Congratulations! Your lucky number came up! This isn't a trick." This is incredible. This is incredible! Papa! Papa! You are out of credit. Please add more money. You are out of credit. Please add more... Matti! Why aren't you in school? I need your phone. Quick! What's up? - Here. I've won. I have to call right away. Or the other tenants will get the prize. For God's sake! This is scandalous! I got taken in by a scam like this. You spend loads calling and they get rich. Nonsense. We took part in a prize draw. We've won a house. Can't you see? - It's a scam. Matti, I'm afraid the lady is right. - Why? It says in bold that it's not a trick. The trick is that it says that. The biggest trick ever! We only took part yesterday. It doesn't work that fast. It'll be weeks before they answer. That's unrelated to the draw. It is ascam. Sadly. I'll drive you to school. - I have to go to the airport! No problem. We'll make it. - I've had enough. I'm getting out. What a nerve! I've never had such athing happen. How absurd! I need to go to the airport. And now ['ll have to walk. Matti, what's wrong? - I don't get grownups. They promise dolphins in the duck pond, a house by the lake or a big prize if you make a call, and none of it is true! Recess. I couldn't keep it in any more. 1 had to tell Turo alf about it. About Papa's Switzerland Lie and the mess it had caused. I couldn't wait for the prize draw. Was I supposed to watch our family go to ruins? I needed a vacation house for us. Quickly. I've got it! "Superintendent required." It's from July to August. 700 euros a month. ' Yes. 80? '? If your papa gets that job, you can go to Finland this summer! And we can help him mow the lawns. "We'? - Yes, our mékki is really close by. Your papa has to call right away before someone else gets the job! But he's driving a bus right now. Darn. Jari, are you coming? Yes! In a minute! What? What the hell? Get out! - In a minute. You have to call this number. Now! You want to be superintendents or what? You're so stupid! - Please, Jari! It's important! I'll take out the trash! All month. Get out of here! This month and next month. I promise! Until Christmas! What's this idiot's name? - Matt... Sulo Pekkanen. Is Jussi Pekkanen your brother? The lumberyard guy? Yes. Why? And? Did it work out? That was the homeowner. His name's Markku. He laughed the whole time and told me not to burn the house down. He said you can pick the keys up in Kokkola on the first of the month. Now get out of here. Fast! Kokkola? Why Kokkola? That's where the job is? - No! Uncle Jussi lives in Kokkola. He'll laugh at Papa if he sees him working as a superintendent. You have to turn it down! You should have thought of that earlier. Now get out! Oh... Here's my trash, yeah? What a stupid situation! Now I had a house for vacation but no one would be staying in it. Because of Uncle Jussi, Papa would refuse to do it. But I couldn't turn it down now. I couldn't ask Papa to quit a job he'd never even accepted. If this got out it'd cause the biggest trouble ever. What are you doing? - Cooking. Anyone can see that. Where's Papa? He's gone out. Sit down. And Mama? Out too. When are they coming back? - Never again. What? Papa was here and he got really angry. He said that Mama would be here in a moment. Then he left, but Mama didn't come either. And Papa didn't say anything else? No. Yes, he did. He said that I should be good. And so should you. I don't believe that. Let's clean up and then go play, yeah? No! I've been slaving in the kitchen all day, cooking! I want you to eat everything on your plate! And if you're good, then we can see what we'll do next. Here... "They started running. They rushed in through the door and into their father's arms. He hadn't had a moment's happiness since losing the children in the wood. His wife had died in the meantime. Gretel shook out her apron..." You left the kids alone. - I had a late shift to go to. I thought you'd be home soon. Sulo! I met up with Cordula. It's been written in big, fat letters on the calendar for ages! Why didn't you call me? - Why didn't you call me? I don't think we can go on like this. Matti! You aren't asleep yet! My darling! Mama! Where were you? Mama and Papa got their wires crossed. I thought that you were never coming back! - No! We'd never, never, never leave you alone. Oh, Sami! My little stink bomb. "Congratulations!" "Win adream house." YOU HAVE WON A DREAM HOME IN FINLAND Yes! Suddenly, I wasn't so sure about it all. Uncle Kurt had said it was often better to let things run their course. So far, everything I had tried had only made things worse. Who knew what might happen this time? Damn it! Oh boy, oh boy! - What's wrong? Nothing. I have to go. But we have math now. - I know. Say that I have a stomach ache. This is important. The future of the universe is at stake! Hello. Matti! Have you finished school already? What's up with you? - Mama, I... What?! That's... What is this? We've won a house. In Finland. - Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! That was my idea! - No, no... Stop... - What was your idea? I told Matti that we should win a house. And now we have! But it isn't like that... - Matti! Hey, I was worried about you! Did someone die? No, way better than that! We won a house! Matti, you won? No, but... - Matti? Kurt? What exactly is going on here? Matti came to see me, upset because you're arguing. He asked me to take part in a prize draw. He wanted to win a house for you. I went to the bank and bought aticket with the 50 euros. The 50 euros? We have to call right away. Okay... Hey! Just wait a minute! Oh, man! Hey! Listen... Can't you see he's on the phone? Say something. What's going on? That was a Mrs. Makela. She already knew about it. We can pick up the keys from her on the 1st of the month. She was so pleased I couldn't get a word in. They've already done the roof, she said. So we have time to settle in first. - What? What does that mean, "time to settle in"? - No idea. What are you waiting for? They probably make sure everything is tip top. Oh, you guys! I was there. I bought the ticket! Accept your good fortune! You've won a house! In Finland! This is... This can't be... It is, Annette! Our own real, furnished house! Our own mékki! Right by the lake! You know what the best thing about this is? The house is in Kokkola. It's close to where Jussi lives. He will be green with envy! { knew that I should have told Mama and Papa the truth but the two of them were so happy { couldn't ruin the mood. { could tell them the house didn't belong to us once we were actually in Finland. It'd be so nice there, no one would be mad at me. We would all have the best vacation ever. You're coming to Finland? - Yes! Maybe we can go to Lapland and see reindeer! It's going to be a great vacation! Isn't Uncle Kurt picking me up? Not today. I got off early especially. Heh? Why? It's a secret. Mama and Papa have a surprise for you both. Would anyone like dessert? - Yes! No! Come on, out with it! What's the surprise? Are we buying a boat? Okay. Matti... Sami... I'll keep this short. We're moving! To Finland! Yeah! Moving? To Finland? But we can't do that. - Yes, we can. I can drive a bus anywhere. And once I've learned some Finnish, I'll find a new office. This morning... both of us... quit our jobs. When the summer vacation starts, off we go! What? Why? Why so hasty? A move is... - A really big change. And that's why. We want a change. - You wanted to go to Finland. Yes! On vacation! Not for always! Oh, Matti! We can't do anything right. I want dessert! Mama and Papa's decision to move away developed into a strange situation. Normally they took ages over a decision but now things couldn't happen fast enough. No! Everyone was happy. You have more muscles than Uncle Jussi. Mama and Papa thought they'd won a house but it actually belonged to Mr. Markku, who thought Papa was his superintendent. Turo and I had gotten him the job. But Papa still knew nothing about it. And each day I thought "You have to tell the truth." But then? Mama and Papa were as happy as I'd always wanted them to be. { knew that if I tried to put the universe in order in the end it'd be more disordered than ever. How could that be? { had to think that over for a while myself. But then it arrived. The last day of school. But we weren't going on vacation to Finland we were emigrating there for good. Matti! Don't you know the time? You have to go! Remember, we're picking you up straight from school. Don't dawdle, okay? ' I still had no solution. HAVE A GREAT VACATION! My dear children! I'm sure you're looking forward to summer vacation. But today is also... a very sad day. Our dear Matti won't be with us next school year. He's moving away. His family has won a house! In Finland! Let's sing a goodbye song especially for Matti. Come up front. That's nice. Okay. "Auld Lang Syne," yes? Right! One moment. Matti? You won a house in Finland? It's not really ours. What do you mean? - I didn't know they'd want to move away. I just wanted us to go on vacation there. - You mean, no one knows? That's insane! Matti! You're the coolest person I know! But what am I going to do now? At last we've become a real family again. Anything might happen once we get to Finland. Who knows? Maybe it'll all turn out fine. If anyone can handle this, it's you. Matti! Are you coming? We'll be late for the plane. "Good luck" in Finnish. We'll have plenty of that. Come visit us soon. Kurt! - Sulo! I promise, you'll make lots of nice new friends in Finland. Stop crying! Don't you know we're onnepekkd? Really lucky devils! Matti! In Finland we will be the happiest family in the world. No one will need to do any crying. I promise you. So there we were. In Finland. The whole family. All together. Unbelievable, but true. Until now, everything was fine. Who knew? Maybe we'd get lucky and things would stay this way. We'd enjoy every moment this journey lasted. We all really deserved this. What? We're going to live here? - No, kulta. I'm just picking up the key to our house. This has all been very well organized. Mrs. Makeld said that Mr. Markku left just half an hour ago on a business trip. He's looking forward to meeting us when he gets back. Oh, how nice! This is unbelievable! I'll go see where the sauna is. I want to see my bedroom! Yes, yes. How peaceful it is! Mama? - Yes, Matti? Do you believe in miracles? Yes! I do. I really do. Come on. Come quick! Look! But... This can't be... Sulo? What does all this mean? - You're asking what it all means? This Markku guy has left all his stuff in our house! But... Papa! Sulo! Calm down! I'm sure there's an explanation. - Papa! I have to tell you something! Papa! Papa, please! Wait a minute! Sulo... Sulo! Sulo, stop it! - Papa, don't, I... Please, Sulo, calm down. Sulo! Kulta, get the prize certificate. No! - Leave me be, Matti. Sulo! - Stop! Listen to me! We didn't win this house! It's all been one huge lie! - What? I made the prize certificate myself. The house belongs to Mr. Markku, not us. That's the truth. I'm a bus driver. Not a superintendent. So here we are. We're in Finland at last but the best summer vacation ever is over before it even really began. But am [ really to blame for this situation? I'm not sure about that. What are we going to do? We need a solution. Now! You have to ask Jussi for help. Never! I know it's hard for you, but... you are going to do as I tell you for once. Go to Jussi and get your family out of this mess! When will you be back? Speak to me! Hey, Papa! You told us that we had a house! - I know! But you told us the same thing! You should have told me the truth. - I didn't know how! And you didn't come tell me the truth about the house in Switzerland. I often try to talk with you. You're always working or at your computer. And even when you are there, I get the feeling you'd rather not be. I know, Matti. And I'm sorry about that. There are many things I'm not good at. Come back. We need you. All of us. We really do. Matti, of course I'm coming back. But... I have to go talk to Jussi first. You're going to Uncle Jussi? But I thought... Where else would I be going? I love you, Papa. I love you too, my boy. But... you don't really want to ask him for help. Then let me go to him. It was me who caused this mess. I'll make it better again. No way! This is my responsibility. But... I'm happy for you to come with me. Maybe it'll be easier if we do it together. What are you doing here? This is a small house for a manager. I don't think I can believe it... Old Makinen passed on the lumberyard to you? That's a good laugh! Your fantastic uncle is a perfectly ordinary woodchopper. He dreamed up that story of taking over the lumberyard. He wanted to show off. Isn't that right? I need your help. Thank you. You bunch of nuts! You can tell straightaway that you're all from the same family. Each one of you is worse than the next one. Matti, that has to be the funniest story that I have ever heard! Winning a house? That's even better than the story about the burning down of the warehouse. Before you all die laughing, go and fetch Annette and Sam.. I'm sure the poor things are wondering what's taking so long. Dear Turo, Greetings from Finland! We've been here for a week, staying with Uncle Jussi. Finland is fantastic. Mama and Papa have changed. Mama has lots of free time now. And she's enjoying every second. Uncle Jussi takes Papa chopping wood so he can be a real jatka too. Papa laughs a lot now, too, and gets along great with Uncle Jussi. Okay, so they still try to outdo one another. That's what brothers are like. And Sami loves it here too. He's already found new friends. It's good to watch them communicating and getting along although they speak different languages. Isn't it strange? So much went wrong and yet we're still a family. Even closer than ever before. Oh, Sami! It wasn't me! Maybe sometimes things look wrong, but aren't. All I know is we all feel really happy for the first time. Turo! Hey! Turo! Matti? What's up? Oh, man! You and I only have two weeks together. And then everything will be over. Oh, Matti! Chill out. It's all just beginning. Turo was right. Maybe I should just leave the universe to itself. For one day at least. Maybe even two days. Okay then. For the rest of the best vacation of all time. Matti, you won the house! This is our house! Turo, we won a house! There's a balcony! A balcony!
