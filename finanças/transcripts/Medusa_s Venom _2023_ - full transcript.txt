- It's just not the way I always meant my first time. - She's a professional who really knows what she's doing. What could be better? - I can think of a lot of things. - We're here now. - Hey, cutie. - Hi. - Who are you looking for? - I... - We don't bite. - Sorry. My friend's a little shy. It's his first time. - That's okay. - Go on. What tickles your fancy? - You like what you see? - Yeah. - Come on. - You interested in a little snack? - How much? - We can arrange something. - It's okay, relax. Don't need to be shy. It's okay. Would you like to talk first? - Yeah. - Okay. What's your name? - It's Gabriel, well, Gabe. - My name's Star. - That's a pretty name. - Do you want to touch me? - Yeah. - Go on. See? That wasn't so bad, was it? - No. - How much you want? - 20. - That won't get you much. - It'll get me exactly what I want. - I'm sure we can come to an agreement. - No agreement. We do what I say. I make the rules. Okay, let's just calm down for a moment. - You do what I say. I'm the customer, and the customer is always right. Now am I going to have to warn you or will you remember not to use any teeth? - Oh, that's nice. Yeah. - Let's get you a little bit more comfortable. - Yeah. Good girl. What have you done? - What was that? - Ooh, where do you think you're going? - She, she burned me. What are you doing? Let me out! - You, you crazy bitch! - You talking to me now? - What did she do to me? Gabe, Gabe! Gabe, Gabe, we need to go. Gabe, we need to get out here. Come on. Gabe, Gabe, Gabe, come on please. We need to go. - Be silent! - You're friends with this insolent fool? - Yeah. - You shouldn't associate yourself with scum like this. - Please, don't. - If I let you go, do you promise to never speak of this night again? - Yes. - Gabe? - What will happen? - Don't worry about him. You don't need people like him in your life. Go. - No. No, don't leave me here. Gabe, please. You'll pay for this when I tell the police about- - No police. - You can't tell me what to do! - We've seen many like you. Many think that they can just take whatever they want. - Who are you? - There have been many before me. I'm just the next one, and there will be many more to come. - We are one, we are many, we are a legion. We are a pits of snakes. - I lost my family, too. I was like you not that long ago, and my parents got really sick, and they both passed away quite suddenly, so. Yeah, I was like doing drugs, dealing drugs. I, I didn't care at all. - Thank you. - And then I found this place. Dunno how, I think like fate probably, and I've been here like ever since. - So who's in charge around here now? - Oh, Simone. Yeah, she went away for a little while, but she came back. Everyone always does that. This place just calls to you. Drink up. It's gonna get cold. Oh. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - It slipped through my fingers. - This place has seen worse stains. - I'm really sorry. - No, I'll just make you one another. - It's, it's all right, don't worry. I, I don't really like tea. You don't have anything stronger, do you? - We don't have alcohol here 'cause of the people that come. It's just all temptation's too great, so. Is that something you struggle with, alcohol? 'Cause if you wanna stay, like all vices have to be stopped. - I just like a drink every now and then, you know? I have been walking for days, so. - Yeah. Okay. How about I go and find you somewhere to sleep then? Yeah? I mean that's if, if you wanna stay. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah? Okay. - Hey, new girl. What are you doing snooping around? I was just getting some fresh air. - What's your name? - Lola. - You're far away from home, Lola. What's that behind your back? - Uh- - You can't drink that. - It's just a beer. - It's not just a beer! We don't tolerate that here! - What are you so freaked out about? - I knew you were bad news. - Who do you think you are? I come here with nothing but the clothes on my back looking for sanctuary, and you accuse me of what? I thought this was a safe place and talk of sisterhood. Sounds more like a regime to me. - Hey, what's going on here? - I was just getting some fresh air, and now I'm being interrogated. - Fresh air. - All right, stop the both of you. You're gonna wake up the whole camp. Come to my caravan and get rid of that. What are you doing walking around? - I was just getting some fresh air. - And drinking. - It was one, all right? The last one. - Find that hard to believe. - This isn't kindergarten. If you would prefer, you can leave now. - No, okay, please, just look. I have nowhere else to go, okay? I came here especially because I don't have anyone else. - You're new here so I will give you the benefit of the doubt, but you can't go wandering around at night. - Why not? - We're very private here. Everyone's whereabouts are accounted for because it isn't safe at night. - But why wouldn't it be safe? - I dunno how much you already know about this place. We have communal times and private time. Outside of that is work. - You do know what we do here, right? - We offer sanctuary to those that travel through, but they learn very little of what we do. Those that stay have to prove themselves and contribute. - So what have I gotta do? - For now, stay in your caravan at night and no more alcohol. - Respecting our rules is the first step. All right? - Well, I'm sorry, okay? I didn't know. - It's okay. Tomorrow we'll show you around, and we can discuss how you can contribute. - Thank you. - I don't trust her. - She's new. You don't like change. We all know that. When Simone comes back, she'll let us know if there's anything to worry about. For now, she's a guest. - Do you... - Spit it out. - Does everyone here do sex work? - Not everyone. I mean, you don't have to if that's what you mean. I dunno how else you'd make your money though. 'Cause that's our main source of income. Oh God, you're not a virgin, are you? - No. You know, all I've ever wanted is somewhere to call home, even if that means I have to work. - It's not dirty, you know, not as society would have you believe. Like there's a stigma attached to it, obviously, but you're in control. Look, it's just a job, you know? Some enjoy it more than others, but yeah, we make the rules and, you know, let's just say we don't respond well to mistreatment. - You're in charge? If I do stay, when will I have to... - No, it's up to Simone, but you will have to pay your way somehow, so. You safe now, you know that? - Yeah. - Oh, she's back. - Oh, she's back. - The queen has arrived. - How'd it go? - Smooth as silk. - What are you up to? - Oh, I just had some unfinished business. It's all sorted now. - Could have given you hand. - Well, don't worry about it. It's my burden to bear. - As long as you're all good. - We're good. So what are we playing? You play poker? - I dunno how to play anything, actually. - No, I'll show you. It's easy. You know how to bluff, right? - Is that like lying about what card you have? - Sort of. - Okay. - What is this? What have I done? Why am I here? - Be quiet. - This isn't funny. - You've been dishonest, Tina. - What? - There's no use lying now. - No, I didn't mean to. - That's no excuse. - No. - You know the punishment for dishonesty. - Please. I won't do it again! - You fed without the sisters. - Please. There has to be another way. - We are one, but you think you're alone? - No. No. No! No! No! - Hey. Who are you? What are you doing here? - I'm sorry, to you before. I didn't mean to bother ya. - So what are you doing here? - I'm, I'm looking for someone. - Who? - A friend of mine. I felt like he was over here. - Well I haven't seen any visitors here tonight. - Anyway, like I should go. Gonna go check Ted's house again. It was nice talking to ya. - Tina? Tina? Tina? - Hey. - Hi. Have you seen Tina? - She's no longer with us. - Oh. - She broke the rules, so we asked her to leave. - What role did she break? - She was being selfish and we share everything here, not take things for ourselves. - I see. - The rules are there for a reason. They keep us all safe. - Do you know where she went? - I don't know. Wherever the wind takes her. - I liked her. - We all did. She was one of us, but sometimes we lose our way, and we have to say goodbye. - Yeah, do you think she'll be back? I mean, Monica said something about sometimes we leave, but then something pulls us back. - I don't think so. You again? - Hey. - Come inside before someone sees ya. - Sorry. - Did you find your friend? - No. His parents haven't seen him either. - It's strange. - But you haven't seen anything just weird going on? - Like what? - Don't really know. There's just something about this place. You know, I feel like I've come here once. Just I don't really remember what happened and, you know, I haven't seen my friend in a few days, and I just felt like he was here, too. - You're funny. - Why? - It don't make any sense. What, you thought you came here once, but you can't remember? Sure you would. What's your name? - Gabe, well, Gabriel. - Well, I'm Lola. - It's nice to meet ya. - So did you really come here looking for your friend, or was that just an excuse to come see me? - No, he, he really is missing. - Oh. - But yeah, I like talking to ya. - I like talking to you, too. I was hoping you'd come back. - Really? - Mm. - Quite interesting. - Interesting. Is that it? - I mean, sure. You're pretty. - Look, I really have to go find my friend. - Hmm. Surely it can wait. - Can I see you again another time? - If you want to. See you then. - Yeah, okay. See ya. - Hi. - Are you busy? - No. - Simone wants to see you. - Hello, Lola. I have been dying to meet you. How have you found it here so far? - Yeah, good. - I'm glad. We're a very close family here. Your presence is both a blessing and an inconvenience. - I don't understand. - We have to be careful who we let in our camp. There are many who wish to see us perish. - Well, I'm not one of those. - Why are you here? - I have nowhere else. - You still have family? - No, they're not my family. Not anymore. That part of my life is over. - They out you? - I don't wanna talk about it. - The pain that you feel, they hold power over you. You will forever be running from it if you don't address it. I can help you with that if you wish. - How? - There is more to this place than what you think you know. - I don't know much of anything about this place. - You know more than you let on. - Well, I know it can be dangerous. - Danger is relative. There is danger from outside and danger from within. Which category do you fall under? - I dunno what you mean. - Who's the boy? - That's Gabe. - And why is he here? - Honestly, I dunno. Oh, he's just curious. He thinks his friend is missing. - Curiosity can be the beginning of something dangerous, but first, you have to earn your place here. We all have to earn our place. Will that be an issue? - No. - The body is a vessel, a conduit before we shed our skin and emerge anew. What we do here, it is nothing to be ashamed of. - I don't- - If you want to, if you wanna be a part of this, you'll have to. I don't want you talking to him. - Why not? - We have to be careful. You might say the wrong thing. He might get the wrong impression. So I can't talk to whoever I want? - You can talk to him, but don't get too attached. He's pure. - What do you mean pure? - Untouched. - That explains a lot. - I only say this to save you from the inevitable. Once you're a part of us, you'll understand. - Can I ask you something? - Why did I come back? - Mm-hmm. - I don't know. There was something drawing me here, like a voice calling to me. I see something in you, Lola, something special. - Hey, new girl. That'll be you soon. When are you gonna contribute? - Soon. - You just come from Simone's? How'd it go? - Yeah, fine. She's very strict. - She can be tough, but it probably didn't help that you were with that guy last night. - How do you know that? - Little birdie told me. Well, you didn't do a very good job hiding it. I just assume you wanted everyone to find out. - I wasn't trying to hide anything. - Doesn't matter. We don't do interlopers. - You think I'm an interloper? You really are something, aren't ya? Oh, what do you actually have against me? - I don't trust you. The young ones, they're all the same. They just take, take, take, and when things get real, then they leave. - Well, if you knew me, you'd know that's not my intention. - Well, I don't know you, but I want you to prove that you want to be here and stay here. Till then, I'll just hold my opinion. - Bitch. - Takes one to know one. - I can't keep doing this. - It wasn't my fault. - It wasn't your fault? - It just happened. - Really? We can't do this clean up all the time. - Thanks. - Okay. - Did you forget something? Come in. - Is this bad time? - No, come in. - What can I do for ya? - Did you hear what was going on in Star's caravan last night? - No, I was working. I didn't hear anything, why? - It was like screaming. - It was probably screams of joy. Men do that sometimes. - It wasn't screams of joy. It was like painful. - I didn't hear anything. - You didn't or you just won't tell me? - Do really want to go there? - Yeah, I wanna know what's going on. - All right. Give me like two minutes to get dressed. I'll take ya. Well, you wanted to see it. - Oh my God. - We call it a snake pit. It's just a fun thing we throw around. - Who are they? - Just bad men. - What did they do? - They just got out of line, and they had to pay the consequence. - That's murder. - That's a gray area. Yeah, they got murdered, but it's just self defense. Like when put in a position where you're taken advantage of by a man, the only option is to fight back. - That is not fighting back! - Yeah, sometimes it goes too far, but sometimes they go too far. Look, right? You're beautiful. You're young. How many times has a guy said something inappropriate, or how many times has a guy done something inappropriate? It's only a matter of time before they don't take no for an answer. There's a lot of those. We're not here to be abused. - How often does it happen? - Not often. We have regulars that are harmless, so we'll set you up with one of them to start. - So you all look out for each other? - Yeah, always, like safety first. - I think I'm ready. - Yeah? - I wanna contribute. - Okay. All right, tomorrow night, me and you. I'll do your hair. - What's wrong with my hair? Can I ask you something? That first day when I arrived, what was that thing you tried to put in my tea? - It's just, it's just something that helps you to transform. - Drugs? What was it? - It's like a cleansing healer thing. - Can I take it now? - He knows? Okay, just a little bit. You won't feel the full effects, but it'll help. - Gabe. What are you doing here? - I'm sorry, I just, I wanted to see ya. - You can't keep showing up here. - Yeah, I know, but I need to talk to ya. - About what? About what happened last time? - No, just, I don't think you're safe here. - Gabe, I'm fine. - No, listen. - No, this is a bad place. Bad things happen here. - I know. - You know? - You know, I've seen what men can do. I've experienced what men can do. - Yes, this is a bad place, but we look after each other. We're like family. - They're not your family. - They're more family than my own ever was. - All right, it's not the men you have to be careful of. - It's the women who work here. - What are you talking about? - Look, I did not come to argue with you. I've come to warn ya. - All right, well, you've warned me. Can you please leave? - Look, I am pretty sure me and my friend were here. It's all just fuzzy like in my head, but that is the only thing that comes up. It's like a dream you never forget. Look, he never came home. No one has seen him, and I am pretty sure- - Well, he is not here if that's what you're implying. - I just want you to be safe. - You can't come in here like Prince Charming and try to sweep me off my feet, all right? Things like that don't happen to people like me. - That is not what I'm doing. I want you to leave please. - Lola, please. - No. I don't wanna see you again. Just go, all right? Now. - Yeah. Yeah, fine. Just promise me you'll look after yourself. That's all I ask. - I wanna talk to Simone. - She's busy. - She's not too busy for me. - There are rules. - Well, I don't care about the rules right now. - Lola, this isn't how we do things here. - I need to speak with you. - What is it? - I wanna know what's going on here, okay? All of it. - I can't tell ya. I'd have to show you. You ready for that? - Yeah, I'm ready. - You're not ready. - I am ready. There's no need to rush. The destination is not the answer to your questions. - Have I not earned my place here? Okay, what more do I have to do? - You've only just started. - I am ready. All right, look me in the eyes and tell me I'm not ready. - Once we do this, you can't go back. - I wanna know. - I'll call the sisters. Are you ready? - Yeah. - Deep breaths. It's begun. Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me. Sh, sh, it's okay. It's okay, yeah? It's okay, it's okay. Sh, sh. - What happened? I could've sworn... - You're gonna see a lot of crazy things over the next three days, okay? - That red powder, does it have something to do with that? - Yeah. It just helps you adjust. The dose should've been given gradually, but the bit you were given last night was a lot more. - What happens now? - Rest. The next few days aren't gonna be easy, okay? But when you feel better, Simone will talk you through what to do, yeah? - , are you? - What is that? - Hey. - What are you doing here? - I came here to see you to make sure you're all right. - You can't be here. - Yeah, I know. Where you going? - I don't know. It just, I can't stay here. - It's okay. What happened? - Look, I can't tell you, all right? I just, I can't be here anymore. - Where are you gonna go? - I dunno. Ooh, ooh. - Hey. - How did I get here? - I, I brought you here. - Why? - You fainted. I didn't really know what else to do. Look, you've had a fever since you got here. That is, I think. Like you were saying some pretty weird stuff. Snakes come up a lot. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I just want you to be safe, and you can say as long as you like. My parents won't mind. - Oh God, no. I couldn't. You barely know me. - I know enough. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Where are you parents? - There away at the moment. They'll be back in a few days. - I don't feel so good. - Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey. Come on, sit down, okay? You haven't eaten in a few days, but I'll make you something, yeah? - Bring him to us. - You okay? - Yeah, nothing. Nothing, I'm fine. - Okay. Just need to step out for a minute, but back in about half an hour. Hey. - Hello? Ah, home sweet home. - Ah, really is the best part of the trip. I mean, I have loved it, but it's great to be home. - Gabe, we're home! Huh, must've gone out. - Oh, well maybe he's asleep. I'll go check on him. - All right. I'll do the unpacking. - Ah, just leave it till tomorrow. Put anything dirty in the hamper. - All right. Whatever. - Gabe? - Everything all right? Did you find him? It really annoys me when people. What the hell? - Hey. Oh my god, I thought I'd never see you again. - I don't know what to do. - I told you it wouldn't easy. - No, it wasn't. - Whose car is this? - I had to take it. Simone, she kept calling me back. - What else did she say? I'll get Simone. - We need to dispose of the car, too, before anyone sees. - I'm glad you're back. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left. - You're home now. That's all that matters. I think it was too soon. Your body didn't have time to adjust. I thought you could handle it, but I was wrong. - I can handle it. It was just too much. I panicked. - It's okay. We all had to go through it. What happened? What did you see? - Snakes, blood. - It will get better in time, and then you all feel the power within you. - I just want the pain to end. - Did you bring him? - What are you gonna do to him? - We're gonna sacrifice him to Manasa to complete your transformation. - No. No, no, he's pure. Like you said yourself. We don't hurt those who are pure. - You got too close. I told her you shouldn't. I did warn ya. - Is there no other way? Please, I don't wanna kill him. - We're not killing him. One thing you need to understand is we are setting him free, free from hardship, free from oppression, free from pain. This is the only way. - Where am I? What's going on? - We are here today to welcome Lola. She has lived with us, learned our ways, observed our rules. She survived the first part of the ritual. Imbibe in the vish so that her body can appropriate. This is no easy feat. It takes everything you've got, mold you so that your body can complete the transformation. We must be proud of Lola, as I was proud of you when you did it. - Lola. - Go to him. - Look at me. Look at me. - I don't know what . I'm sorry. - You didn't do anything. - Lola has brought us the offering. - What's that mean? - Sh, you will see. It's okay. - This isn't right. I never wanted this. - It'll be over soon. - We'll make it painless. - No, no, please, please. No. - We call to you. Please bless this offering. We are your servants. We call who you. We call to you! Please accept this offering. We call on you. Please blessed this offering. We call on you. Kalana. - We call on you. - Kalana. Please accept this offering. - She has come. - Sisters, we are witnessing something great. - Witness Manasa.
