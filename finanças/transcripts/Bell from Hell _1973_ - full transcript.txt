(upbeat music) (cup tapping) (mixture sloshing) (footsteps tapping) (pen scribbling) (paper tearing) (photo tearing) (door scraping) (footsteps thudding) (door creaking) (door clanging) (knocking on door) - Come in. (door shuts) Well, my boy, your case is coming up in two months. Here is the summons. If you suspected we are letting you out on a kind of probation, you're absolutely right. Your aunt and I hope that you can conduct yourself normally. (John scoffs) Wait a minute. Don't forget to report back here every eight days. (door closes) (phone clicks) (birds chirping) (door squeaking) (birds chirping) (engine revving) (engine idling) (engine roaring) (engine roaring) (engine roaring) (children singing "Frere Jacques") (wings flapping) (birds chirping) - The wild fig trees have been uprooted from the graves. The blood of the toad and the bone snatched from the mouth of a bitch in heat are waiting. The dead will rise. The owl hooted three times when your parents secretly copulated to conceive you. I thought that you were far away. Why have you come back? - [Shepherd] They made me. - I told you when you were only a child that you would be unlucky. Already fate has dealt the cards. - But I'll play them. (engine revving) (engine roaring) (rain pouring) (engine revving) (tense music) (lid creaks) (piano bangs) (door creaks) (children singing "Frere Jacques") (book slams) (animals squealing) (blood pouring) (machine roaring) (animals screaming) (bones snapping) (water spraying) (footsteps thudding) - Thank you. Why do you want to leave? - I've learned enough. (water pouring) - John? I didn't know you were back. Staying for a while? - Yes. - I got married. - Hmm. (horn blaring) - I'm glad you're well again. (birds chirping) (cart creaking) (engine roaring) (engine roaring) (water splashing) - I quite understand that you wanted to go home to your mother's house. Only I would have preferred to have you here. It's a long way and I know that you could never phone. Do you want your tea with mint or lemon? - With lemon. Won't you let me help you? - There's no need, I'll be ready in a moment. (paper ripping) (doorbell rings) (drawer shutting) Would you please open the door? - Okay. - Does Mrs. Aveiro live here? - [John] She's my aunt. - If it's the vendor, keep him company while I finish here. Would he also like some tea? - No. - He says he would. She would be upset if you didn't accept. Have you met my aunt? - No, no. - So you don't know. - Know what? - She was confined to a nursing home. Now she insists on living at home-- (cups crashing) Are you cold? - A little. - I'd love to close that door, but I daren't. - No? Why not? - A few years ago, her three daughters went out of that door to go fishing. There was a very heavy fog. The boat was lost at sea or smashed against some rocks. They never came back. (clocks chiming) Aunt Marta went mad and the shock paralyzed her. She thinks her daughters will come back at any time and that they will come back singing as they used to. Whenever there's a fog she prepares tea for them. That's why I can't close that door. You understand, don't you? - Yes, I think I do. (door creaks) - I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. I get clumsier all the time. This handsome young man is my nephew. - We've already met. - You didn't bring another cup. The chemist from Juarez sent you? - Oh yes, he told me you were planning to have some construction done. - My roof needs to be repaired and so does the front. My friend spoke very highly of you. Did you hear that? - What? - It was probably nothing. My daughters have gone out fishing on the sea. They shouldn't be long now. Does the door bother you? Shall I close it? - Oh, I met that bearded beggar the other day. He recognized me. He said the dead would rise-- - And of course the dead will rise (spoon clatters) to be judged. Death is simply a transition. Don't you agree? (girls singing "Frere Jacques") There they are at last. (tense music) - My god! (teacup clatters) (door slams) - Hang up your coats. Wipe your feet. What did you tell the poor man? - He's here! He's come back! - So I see. - You're much thinner. - Must have frightened him with one of your practical jokes. I can see you haven't changed. - Much taller and much fatter. - He's just the same. - Take your foot off the sofa, Esther. - What did they do to you in the clinic those three years? Did they cure you? - Yes. Now I'm completely mad. - I believe you. - Hello. - How's Mr. Supermarket? - I prefer that you call your cousin's fiance by his name. - Do you know she's almost pregnant now? - Really? - When they get married they'll have two more supermarkets. Twins. - Do you mind if I tell you I'm not exactly overjoyed to see you? Why have you come? - My case comes up the 15th and-- - Maria, your tea. I want you to know that I haven't changed. And I'll do anything I can not to have you squander my sister's money. - I thought we might meet at my house first-- - It won't be your house for long. - She'll never forgive you for that night. - Shut up! When you didn't finish raping her. (screams) - Stop it! - You didn't help. - I said stop it! - He is the one who's got problems. He's scared because he doesn't wanna go back to the clinic. - His problems are ours, the whole family's. - I won't go to that house. I don't trust him. - I do. - You will do whatever is necessary to do. - So what about Tuesday? - We'll be there Tuesday. - Three years without seeing you. - It was a mistake to let him out. (giggles) (smooching) - My dearest darling? Do you know what you are, my dearest darling? - What? - You're a stupid cunt. A stupid cunt who doesn't even know what to do with it. (crying) And I'm an idiot. Christ, I should've known. - Known what? - Your mother set you up as bait and I nibbled. It's true isn't it? Isn't it? (screams) - You bastard! They're right about you. - Oh? What did they say? - That you're a cruel, selfish, sadistic mean, psychotic bastard. (sobbing) - God. I must get away from here, away from your sick mother and your crazy sisters. - You are mad. - Maybe. - And you're not going anywhere. My mother won't let you. (birds chirping) (wood scraping) (footsteps tapping) (tense music) (choir singing in foreign language) (cart creaking) (children shouting) - I know you won't believe me, but I've prayed a lot for you and for your mother. - I know you were the only one who tried to help her. - Yes, well she couldn't believe that the church forgave her while her family and friends did not. Often the worst enemies of the church are the hypocritical bigots and the phony Catholics. - And the phony mad and the phony sane and everything that's phony. - What'll you do now? Tell me, son. - You wouldn't want to know. (birds chirping) - Hey fellas, look at that bird will ya? - It's not flying away. It's not frightened. - Do you see that? A wild duck that hunters don't scare in the least. - It's a little late to be around here, don't you think? Hey, I'm asking you. Didn't they teach you to reply when you're spoken to? - I guess maybe she can't talk. Wild ducks probably don't. (men laughing) - Oh, by the way, I wonder what sex, male or female. - Come on, boys. Let her go. - Your father could get upset. (girl crying) And now the little duck is frightened. (men laughing) - We gotta find out if it's male or female. - Yeah, we gotta find out. - That's enough. - No! - Oh, we're just having fun. Come on, let's see, let's see. (men laughing) (girl crying) - Who are you, little bitch? - Let me go! - You're a tough one, aren't ya? (men laughing) (chickens squawking) - Why aren't you happy? - Happy? I think I am. - How often do you need to have sex? You haven't done it with your husband for three weeks. - What? What do you mean? - You were brushing your hair. He came out of the bathroom, gargling, and told you, well told you very crudely what he wanted. - How do you know all this? (rooster crowing) - The day I repaired your TV I hooked a microphone to your bed. - Why? - It was like having you in my arms. - That wasn't nice. - I know. I deserve to be punished. Would you like me to stay a week without eating? Or tear out my eyes? Yes. I'll tear out my eyes. (imitates groaning) (woman screams) (suspenseful music) - Keep 'em as a souvenir. Listen, take it easy. It was only a joke. Look, they're made of glass. (suspenseful music) (footsteps tapping) (girl shivering) (man shivering) - She might freeze to death. - Come on. We'll pick her up another day. I'm beginning to freeze too. (man laughing) - You wanna stay, Peter? We may get into trouble. (footsteps crunching) - Go on, grab the rope. Go ahead now. We won't hurt you. I promise you. Don't be afraid. Come over to the fire. - I don't like this. (animal squealing) (girl crying) - I'm backing out. - We started this together, friend. Don't back out now. (girl whimpering) (engine roaring) (man screaming) (man screaming) (man screaming) (gunshot firing) (engine idling) (engine roaring) (footsteps tapping) (sheep bleating) - What happened? - She'll live. They didn't do anything. - Who did it? - Soon I'll be going away forever. Promise me you won't do anything till then. - Who were they? Who? (people chattering) - Hm-mm. Mm-hm. (whispering indistinctly) (door shuts) - Oh, uh, look, about yesterday, we weren't going to hurt the girl. - It was just a joke, right? - Yes, we were just having a little fun. You know, we didn't mean anything, you understand. - If you don't mind? - Hmm? Oh. (zipper unzips) We bought her a new dress. So let's forget about it. I'm sure we can count on you. - Of course. And we'll also forget about your wife. And me. - What's that? What did you say? - Nothing. It was just another joke. Ask her. I told her you would do this, and I was right. Thanks. (people chattering) (bell ringing) (waves crashing) (birds squawking) (children singing "Frere Jacques") (suspenseful music) (water spraying) (children singing "Frere Jacques") (tape rips) (suspenseful music) (doorbell ringing) (bird squawking) (bird squawking) - What's the matter? It's Tuesday, remember? - Here we are. - Yes, you invited us. - Did you forget? - Of course not. Come in. - Wonderful! Everything's the same. - It's enough to have you committed. - Why? Don't you love it? - You think you're so superior, don't you? But you never explained why. - Total waste of money. If it weren't for me there wouldn't be a penny left of your mother's fortune. - May I have your order? (girl laughs) - I'll have a blood Mary. (bird squawking) - And you. Miss? - Gin tonic. - Dr. Cunquiero called. You didn't report to him? - What for? I'm not going back. - Well, you're still on probation. Don't forget, John. - The other day I was going through your accounts. The first of each month you transfer 50,000 pesetas to the clinic from my account. - Your treatment is very expensive, John. - And 100,000 more to Dr. Cunquiero personally. Why? - What do you think? - Perhaps so they could give me extra special treatment. If I'm declared insane you'll have the money forever, won't you? - Your mother trusted me, John, and she named me her executor. I'm not going to get angry with you, but you are being very silly. - Why did you want us to come here? - Come on! Let's have some fun. Today'll be an important day for all of us. (upbeat electronic music) (clears throat) - Hey! (screams) (monkey grunting) - I don't know how you can live with all those animals. - I like animals. They're real. They eat when they're hungry. They sleep when they're tired. And they fuck when they're in heat. You've never been in heat, Aunt. - It's enough! - Let's go. - Sit down! (birds chirping) I'm not impressed by your vulgarity or by your tricks. I want to know why have you invited us. - I wanted to see you, talk to you. - Good. Go ahead and talk. - It all started five years ago, when I went to London. - Yes, you were underage, and you ran away without my consent? - Did you practice free love? - Yes. - I want to start, but Mother won't let me yet. - One thing I know, I hated my mother's money. I wanted to burn it and start all over. - And I, as your guardian, stopped you. You do not burn money. You invest it. - I was picked up in Hamburg and forced to come back. I wonder when I used to smile I remember my mother saying, "When a child smiles we forget he also has a future." I wanted to pick my own future. - We heard all about it in the court hearings. Living with prostitutes, running around Europe with drug addicts, et cetera. - Why must your way be the only way? You punished me too hard. You threw me to the lawyers, psychiatrists, and they pounded me, crushed me. - You were ill, John. And the judge and the doctors believed that you needed a few months away, treatment. Nobody wanted to punish you, John. - Aunt Marta, please save me. I'll give up everything, the house, the money. I'll do whatever you say. Just give me one thing. - What's that? - Give me back my passport and you'll never hear from me again. I swear it. - I can't do it. - Please. - Let John go. - I can't. If anything happens to him then they will blame us. So everything has to be done legally. - Okay. As you wish. Let's begin. (film rolling) Why did you always hate my mother? - I didn't hate her. I hated her weakness and her immorality. - I often go to the cliff. I'm thinking of planting some pine trees, and there isn't a single tree there. And she was so fond of them. What do you think? - A very touching idea. John? (birds chirping) Maria's gonna get married soon. Please leave her alone. - That still leaves Teresa and Esther. For you. - Leave your cousins alone. All three of them, please. - Shh! Remember your heart. You look tired. Are you? Why don't you close your eyes and sleep like a good little girl? Would you like me to sing you a lullaby? - That would be nice. It would be so wonderful. Why do you behave so strangely sometimes? - I'm irresponsible. Didn't the doctors tell you? A real menace to society. - It's not surprising, growing up without a father and your mother. May she rest in peace. - She had her punishment. She killed herself. She can not rest in peace. - It was an accident, John. (John humming "Frere Jacques") (engine rattling) (film rolling) (bottle spraying) (bees buzzing) (film rolling) (footsteps thudding) (film rolling) (footsteps thudding) (film rolling) (footsteps thudding) (film rolling) (film rolling) - What's the matter? - I'm tired. Man is a strange animal. He has a conscience. - You're so different now. - Dr. Cunquiero would change anyone. He destroys you slowly, like a worm inside your brain. And finally you realize there's only dust in your head. Dust. Caress me. - Maria would do it better, wouldn't she? - [John] You sound like a woman now. - Why didn't you marry her? - [John] I wanted to show her the Taj Mahal, the Temples of Luxor, the China wall. But you she didn't want to come with me. - I would have. I'd like to go away with you. - You don't think I'm-- - No. - At least at first I wasn't. But now perhaps I am. I'd like to know. - Are you all right? - No, I'm not. (laughs) - Is this a new game? (laughs) - In every tragedy there's a missing victim. In this case you're it. - What are you doing? - I've got to do it. I've got to do it. (film rolling) - I hope nobody saw you come up. Where did you leave mother? - Dead, in the garden. Are you happy? - I'm all right. You sure no one saw you come up? What's wrong? - Why? When did this war first begin? At first I was sure I could stand it. But then something began to go to pieces in my brain. Then something else began to grow. Hatred! (Maria gasps) It was painful. But when I accepted it I felt better. - Why do you talk like that? Where's my mother? - I told you. Dead. She's dead. If there's none of you here there'll be no case. And you're not going to be anywhere. I'm irresponsible. That's what your doctors have said. I don't know the difference between right and wrong. And do you know why? There is no difference. There are only roles. (suspenseful music) (Maria screaming) (door slamming) (hand smacking) (film rolling) - If you think you're scaring me, you're wasting your time. I know you're there. - We were all free then. The past didn't exist, and the future wasn't a threat. We weren't trapped in the web. - Trapped? How? Where's mother? - Asleep. And your sisters. You and I are the only ones awake. - I want you to know one thing. I don't trust you. I know you're capable of anything. - Aunt Marta and you have made your plans. And I have made mine. - I really believe you're sick. - I'm mad. - I can get you put away again. I'll even lie if I have to. - You already lied once. Told them I tried to rape you. - Don't touch me. Don't touch me! Let me go! Let me go! - It's too late now. Too late for all of us. (girl gasping) (girl crying) (film rolling) (girl whimpering) (girl screaming) (girl screams) (tray bangs) (machine roaring) (machine roaring) (machine squealing) (water spraying) After death, what happens to the skin, to the eyes, to the soft, silky hair? Everything rots and disappears. Your bodies will turn into sap, and in the spring, the sap will rise up the pine trunks. In a few years, I'll come back to the cliff, and I'll think, "Those leaves are perhaps Teresa's fingers, "and those others, her cheeks, and her lips." You'll always be facing the sea and the wind will caress you for centuries and centuries. (blood gushing) (cow screaming) (water spraying) (table bangs) (table crashes) (table bangs) (doorbell rings) (footsteps thudding) (hand slapping) - What did you tell my husband? What kind of bed did you and I make? When? - I'm sorry. It was a joke. - You like to play jokes, don't you? - I love it. - And the thing about us, is that also a joke? - I would've loved to have done it, but not with you unconscious. Not that way. (machine roaring) (Esther screams) - I wanna get out! - I can't open it. - When he comes back pretend you're trying to escape. I'll kill him myself. - I won't let you! - He's completely crazy. Can't you see? It's his life or ours. - I want out. I want out. I want out! - Shut up, you idiot! - Tell him to come and see me tomorrow night at 12 o'clock. I'll apologize to him if that'll make you happy. Now please go. You shouldn't be here. Please go. (door closes) (birds chirping) (footsteps tapping) (rain pouring) (wind howling) (thunder rumbling) (wheelchair clanging) (train roaring) (thunder rumbling) (screams) (tool tapping) - We've installed a new church bell. It weighs two tons. - And? - It'll be run for the first time tomorrow. To operate it requires a system of counterweights. And you, you'll be one of the counterweights. - What will you tell them? That I ran away? In the end, I couldn't hurt you. (cat meowing) - At the first peal of the bell you will hang. - I only want to know one thing. Was I really insane or was it Dr. Cunquiero? I must know. Who was right? You? Are you right? - A malignant tumor has to be cut out. I could not sleep as long as you were alive. - You won. You've always won. May you all sleep in peace. - The last two bricks. - Who are you? - The one who gets the last laugh. Now, don't you think that's funny? - You may leave here, but I promise you, I'll have the last laugh. - We live in troubled times. Wars, revolutions, civil disturbances, the wanton killing in many lands of innocent men, women, and children for political ends. Yet, in our darkest hours, there can still be heard by those who choose to listen, the voice of our maker. God speaks to us every moment of the day and of the night. And in these dark times we need to hear him more than ever. I thank all those who have made their contributions so that this church may have this new bell, which will carry the voice of our Lord to more distant places, which will command the attention of all those who do not wish to listen to it. God bless you all. (speaks in foreign language) Amen. Come on. (footsteps thudding) (bell rings) (choir singing in foreign language) (bell rings) - What's wrong? Can I help you? (engine whirring) (door slams) (engine whirring) (doors slamming) (engine roaring) - Esther? - I'm leaving. I won't go into that house again. - Why not? - You killed him. - We did something terrible. But it was necessary. - Goodbye. - Esther? You are underage. I can force you to obey me. - If you do I'll tell everything, Mother. I'll scream it to the whole world. - I'm exhausted. Let's go. (engine idling) (engine roaring) - We're getting fog again. - Are you going to see him? - Who? - You know perfectly well who. He wants to give you an explanation. - That won't be necessary. I think our neighbor's finally left us alone. - Why? (man gargling) - He's gone away, abroad. - He didn't tell me that. - I don't want his name mentioned again. (suspenseful music) - Didn't you say he'd gone away? (door creaks) (birds squawking) (door slams) - [John] Come right in. (wings flapping) Over here. No, here. (water bubbling) (doors sliding) I'm waiting. This way. (monkey chittering) Come on. - What do you want? What do you want from me? (upbeat electronic music) How could you get out? How could you? Answer me! You can't be here! You can't! (banging) (piano bangs) This was your last laugh. Your last laugh. Your last laugh. Your last laugh! (laughs) (laughs) This was your last, last laugh. The last laugh. Last-- (water splashing) (water bubbling) (bubble popping) (tapes whirring) (tapes clicking) (footsteps shuffling) (children singing "Frere Jacques") (engine roaring)
