If cats disappeared from the world.. How would this world changed? If I disappeared from the world.. Who on earth would sad for me? You may not believe it, but all this is actually happen to me. And then, before long.. I'm going to die. This letter is my last letter that I wrote for you. In other words, you could say that this is my will. Yamada-san, mails~ Ah good afternoon~ Thankyou very much. For today are 1, 2, 3... 3 mails. Be careful. Do you eat meal properly? Of course. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Thankyou for your work today. Because tomorrow Yamada-san will take absence as well.. Tsutaya. This is mail for you. I'm Tatsuya though. Well forget it. This is for today. This time the title looks difficult. Don't think, -feel it. -feel it. Thankyou. Don't you get tired with such an exchange? Mikan-chan. *Mikan: Orange* I'm Mika. The movie's ticket.. I don't want to. My life up until now.. coming from the past through today, and moving forward to the infinite future. No. I'd never thought such things like future. I thought it was only natural I would face the next morning. Drink coffee, take care of my cat, eat breakfast and go to work. I just continue morning like that with nothing special in my mind. It's brain tumor. Quite enlarge near the brain stem. We don't know the detail until further examination, but there is possible a cancer. Am I going to die? The condition quite severe. It's also hard to do a surgery. How long can I live? It's not a strange circumstances if you could live for at least a week. From your condition now to reach a stage of death also possible. Please take hospitalization immediately. Are you alright? Yes. That's what I'd rather say in my delusion. What was that we talk about? About the hospitalization... I've never been flustered when I deeply longing for something. This time I did. "How many more movies can I watch?" "How many more books can I read?" "Even though I just start collecting shampoo.." "Even though I can get cleaning for free just with one stamp more.." I find myself thinking of nothing but such things. I'm home. Ah welcome home. Howaa you frightened me! Everyone always have such reaction~ Well well, sit and let's talk. Why...looks exactly like me? Excuse me, who are you? Who do you think I am? God of death? Errr, no. Devil..? Um, well, just take with that. Yes. I'm devil. Okay with that? There is no time to explain. Then, what will you do? What will I do? You are going to die soon, aren't you? It's tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow, you'll die. -How do you know things like that? -How do you know things like that? Well forget it. In short, tomorrow you'll die and I come here just to inform you. Unfortunately. Eh? Eh? What? You want to die as it is? I don't want to die. I thought so. Then, there is one way so you're not going to die soon. A way so I'm not going to die soon? Yes. You... -what kind of person are you? -"what kind of person are you?" therefore I said an evil spirit, that's enough! Just be aware of the situation! Look, the pain comes again. Eh? Next time the pain will be stronger. You don't have much time. Is that real? The way so I won't die... If you know some dealings, it's very easy to extend your life. What do you mean? Erase one thing from this world, on the other hand you can extend your life for one day. That's the condition. Erase? Erase what? See there are so many things in this world that are okay to disappear. Doesn't this world full of unnecessary things? Aah we don't need trump cards.. Do you need rubik's cube? I understand. O! You've made your determination. Good. Then, parsley... Eh? Please erase the parsley.. Sorry, wait, what did you say? That's not like that. Eh? Dont "eh?" me. I'm the one who decide what will be erased. Eh why like that? Can you just stop asking? To get something, we have to lose something. That is the rule of this world. Then, what will we erase? Right, what will we erase? Howaa! You surprised me! Ah I'm sorry. Hello? Chief, tomorrow I can't. Yes, I'm sorry. Would you excuse me to absent this week? I'm not feeling very well. Yes, if you wouldn't mind. I'm sorry. Thankyou. Ah, That's. Eh? Looks like we don't need that. Yosh I've decided. Let's erase phones from this world. Phones.. Ah you just feeling relieved right now. You thought "If phones, well, it is ok~", right? Not like that. Definitely. Day and night playing with phones, you said that living like that is useful, but the truth is boring. Ah, well, for example, if we erase the phones.. This is not an example, I'm going to erase for real. You make me irritated. I'm sorry. Hah? Won't you call someone? The phones will disappear. Don't you get it? I'll make a call. You entry so many like that, in the end you have no one you want to call for the last time? I do have. Do you? well up to you. You can survive for one more day in return for the phones. Well, enjoy phones for the last one day. You thought "Is this dream?", didn't you? Eh, exc.. Just for one night, please.. If you do that, you will getting harder to say farewell later. Put it back again. I've repaired this. Thankyou. It's cute though.. Okaasan have cat allergic. Eh? Can't be helped. I'd try to keep at this cat. Really? We have to decide its name. How about "Retasu"? Eh? *read: retasu* (Lettuce) Un, Retasu! Alright. Let's use that name. Retasu, come here. Retasu. Retasu, come here. Retasu, come here. Ah. You came here.. Even though Retasu was my cat, why she become okaasan's cat. It's because you neglect looking after her.. Nee, Retasu? Okaasan doesn't sneeze at all. Ah now that you mention it, you're right. Give to me. Retasu is mine. No way, mine. Long time no see. Long time no see. Somehow sorry. It's ok. Why suddenly? Um, there is phone.. Phones? I want to make a call or..how should I put it? Why? For example, if you have to erase phones so you won't die.. who do you want to call for the last time? I thought about it. You always think about everything by put it in to an example. That part of you doesn't change. So you decided to call me for that? Well, something like that. Isn't there anyone else? The person you should call for the last time. Okaasan. I've repaired this watch. Why at this time? Even you've never visited her at once. What have you been doing? Have you met your father since then? Nope. Although I've said that I want to get along well with my mother. I never hear that. The truth is even after we separated, I've met with her several times. Really? She teach me about cooking, and later going to hospital together. Hospital? I didn't know at all. Then? What will you do after meet with your ex-girlfriend? Sorry, I don't have anything particularly Because I just want to make a phone call. Why since a while ago you looks like chewing something? This morning I took my silver tooth unintentionally. Sorry. You don't have to apologize. What was that we talk about? Therefore, I want to make a call.. Phones.. Somehow that's nostalgic. Yes. Hello? Hello? Excuse me, is this Seki-san's house? Ah no, this isn't. I'm sorry. Is that Metropolis? Are you watching Metropolis directed by Fritz Lang by now? Yes, right. Right now is almost the last part, isn't it? Underground city looks like will death, right? But It's okay. At the last moment the children can be rescued. Ah, I'm sorry. I said it first, I'm really sorry. No, I'm glad. I started to think that I don't want it to have a bad ending. So, thankyou. Now I can watch it with relief. Do you like movie? Yes. But I don't knot know very well.. I have a friend who knows very well about movie. He just lend me the movie which I should watch. I call him Tsutaya. Back then I was surprised. Having the same class with person in the wrong call. So did I. But, even though we ended up dating, we couldn't talk much. You're right. A long time ago since watch movie, that was interesting. Which one do you like? Which one... Do you properly watch? Even though you talked much in the phone. Out. I was too nervous. That's why I liked your phone call. Talking in the phone after coming back from date.. Ah, you've already arrived at home? Un I'm home now. Ah, which reminds me, not long time ago I found amazing great band in net. Later I will sent you the youtube's address, try to listen it. What's band? I think maybe Russia's band.. Talk about novel or music of no concern and talked as if the world possible to change Although we only separated in 20 minutes by walk. Talking in the phone for hours. Even it faster if we meet face to face. Talked on the phone for all night long, the next day date we both lack of sleep. And the two of us end up spend time in the train. To the extent that we dated just to make a phone call. That was fun. In the end.. why we broke up? We didn't particularly break up because we hate each other. But, that's happen sometimes. Where are you going? Toilet. You still live here? Yes. This is my workplace too anyway. Certainly. Well then, till here. Ah. You should repair your tooth immediately. Yes. Thankyou for meeting me today. About the parable before.. I think I don't want phones to disappear from the world. If there was no phone then we wouldn't meet each other. That's true, but... The truth is.. I'm going to die soon. Eh? Apparently lose by brain tumor So that's why.. What a nice last date. Life is wonderful, right? Well, phones, is it okay to erase any time now? I don't want phones to disappear from the world. If there was no phone then we wouldn't meet each other. No way... What are you doing? Who are you? I'm sorry.. Then what will you do? You still want to live, don't you? What did you do to her? what did I do? If something going to disappear, the memories and the connection to them, all part of it will disappear too. That's natural, right? Well, you can live for one more day, is that a good thing? Then, let's decided what we'll erase for the next. This. Let's erase movies from this world, in return for one day life. By sacrificing something like this.. Can I live longer day by day? Let's go eat something. Excuse me. You like movie, don't you? Yes. Do you like it? Quite like it. I often watched movie in Kinjanai Theater since childhood. *Minatozaka is a city in Fukuoka prefecture* Minatozaka? Yes. Then released in April 1996, "Underground". Ah. I watched that. I envy you. I missed it. I would never forgive appendicitis. Appendicitis? I were hospitalized because of appendicitis. I couldn't watch that in screen, what a regret for my whole life! Is that so? How was that? How was that? Your appreciation. (talking about Underground movie) They have wedding's party in the end of the movie. (talking about Underground movie) That for sure a movie that should watch in big screen. Sorry, I didn't really understand that. Why do you like movie? I wonder why.. Life is a tragedy if you see from close, sparkle if you see from far. Phrase from Chaplin. Movie that resemble you is not deep, not compete, not heavy, nor either light. But there are lines that remain in your heart. Thankyou. I'll bring you the next one. *TSUTAYA is a Japanese rental shop operated by Culture Convenience Club* Somehow you look like Tsutaya.. I'm Tatsuya though. Thankyou for this. This is for today. Thankyou. This is for today. I forgot. This is for today. This is for today. Thankyou. There will be no end for movies. That's why this relation also will continue for eternity. That's so. Morning Tsutaya. I'm Tatsuya. You're right. What's wrong? Somehow you look pale. Never look so well from the start though. How about the one I lend you before? You see.. That wasn't difficult at all, was it? as much as you like For example.. It's only for an example.. If this is for the last time.. If I can only watch one before I die, what movie would you tell me? Lend me that. If I buy a book, I would read the ending first for sure. Cause it's possible for me to die first before I could finish it. * When Harry met Sally is a movie released in 1989 where Billy Crystal played as lead actor.* "When Harry met Sally". Billy Crystal. How can I choose one title? Surely I'd die first before can choose one. Anyhow, movie will vanish from this world, as if it had never been. Face it. But before that we can watch one. Won't you choose it for me what I should watch? As long as there is a good story, there will always be someone to talk. Only with that life isn't something to thrown away. After all the last one doesn't exists. There is nothing such as that. Like this, our movie relation will continue for eternity. That was also my intention. But this is the last time. Why?? What's wrong? I have to find it. What are you looking for? It's useless. I can't find it. I'll help you. What's the title? He is going to die. Who? Even though it's always my duty to choose movies for him. But I can't find it. Even though I've been searching from some time ago. Even though I've been searching all the way. No matter what I can't find it. Thankyou very much. You don't have to watch it for the last time. Does it have to be movie? What? No matter what.. It doesn't really matter whether movies exist or not. Even if movie doesn't exist nobody would die. But.. After all there also things that only can do by movies or music. Art film or literary course.. Those art film or literary course, are those more important? Life is more important, isn't it? You're right but... Then let's erase movies now. W-wait, give me more time- It already disappeared. There will be no end for movies. That's why this relation also will continue for eternity. Tsutaya.. Are you looking for something? Let's go eat something. I get it. Hola Oooh, welcome back, girlfriend-boyfriend. Toumo-san, thenk you very much. As you said, those meat is great. As I said. Thas was delicious? Yes. Delicious. Let's drink. Ah, am I bothering you two? Yes maybe, but we'd love to. *"Zehi" is used when you want to show how eager you are to do something* By all means. *"Zehi" is used when you want to show how eager you are to do something* Well, I'll get in your way. This is a little bit sweet. Whoops! Hurry! Quickly! Bus already came! Cemetery in Argentina, there's written those dead person's history and social class. I don't know why but the image very much like an exclusive residential district. That bridge! Used in "Happy Together". Happy together? Movie. -That was in that movie. -Right. Toumo-san, why you travelling around the world? Time? Build up the wall, shuts yourself up in the room, even turn off phones. My father has a watch store. I'm sorry. I'm going to live my life! I will stay alive! If you do travelling, you'll know that this world is full of cruelty. But beside of that you'll also realize that there are so many beautiful things. Hmmm that really nice~ Came to this idea. Don't you have plan to comeback to Japan? I've aleady in Japan for 18 years. Is that enough? If, just for an example.. If you're going to die, and you have to decide the last place to spend your time. Even like that you would never going back to Japan? Mmmm I wonder.. I never thought that. It's ok till here. Then, this is farewell.. As long as we live, we will meet again somewhere. Eh? Your eyes moistened. I dislike such things as farewell. I must go now. You two keep get along well. Yes. -Adios -Adios See you later. Take care of yourself. Somehow I don't want to go back. You're right. That way of life also possible, doesn't it? It does possible.. Nothing change. Even though Toumo-san died, this world doesn't change at all. Just as if Toumo-san's presence never exist before. Why like that? Even though we were living together I dont know whether I sad or not. If I died.. is there anyone who would cry for me? and of course Could you face the next morning like nothing change in this world? I'm going to live my life! I'm going to live my life! I'm going to live... If I disappeared from the world.. who in the earth would sad for me? Would you sad for me? Watches already disappeared. There was no other way, wasn't it? With this you can extend your life for one more day, isn't this good? Eh? Somehow you make a depressed face. Losing connection with important people is painful. But your life is the most important, don't you agree? To get something, we have to lose something. Then, decide what we will erase for next. Let's erase cats from this world. I'm home. Retasu hasn't eat anything at all. Is that so? You shouldn't follow me, Lettuce. What do you mean? I'm sorry. The truth is okaasan.. What should we do? About what? There is nothing we can do. Retasu? Retasu! Let her sleep peacefully. Now she can go to a place where there's no more pain. It was painful, wasn't it? I'm sorry, I can't do anything. It's alright now. You won't be in pain anymore. *written "pick me up"* Come here. I'm home. Eh? What happen? I don't know.. Cute. Just like Retasu. This time is Kyabetsu? It's decided. Fixed names. Welcome, Kyabetsu. *read: kyabetsu* (Cabbage) I'm afraid there are no more rooms for today. But.. Don't worry about it. Maybe okaasan forced you to brought me. But.. I'm sorry. I understand. Excuse me. Isn't it quite a nice inn? Not at all. Well, let's eat Delicious. Thankyou. Thankyou. This, I want to give it to you. What's that? If I'm gone... Stop it! Things like a will like that. I'm going to take a bath. Kyabetsu? Kyabetsu? Where are you? Kyabetsu. Kyabetsu. Kyabetsu! Do you understand? Pull yourself together please. Please calm down. Kyabetsu! Okaasan.. I'm the one who is writing this letter now, before long will disappear from this world. Before that, what I want to do? I tried to think about this and that. "I want to eat delicious food." "I want to go to various places." "I want to be fashionable." While I'm thinking of those stuff, I realized it. Everything that I want to do before I die is everything that I want to do for you. But there's nothing more that I can do for you. Therefore, from now on, try to believe in and show the good part of you. The good part of you. You always stay right by my side. When someone's happy or sad, you can getting close to them gently. Your lovely sleeping face, and your curly hair. Your habit to touch nose unconsciously. Your behavior when you concern over people around you more than needed. When you were born, you don't know how my world becomes beautiful and bright. It's feeling good. The day when you were born was also a good day just like this. Really? What's wrong? When you were born, your father said "thankyou". "Thankyou for being born to this world." He said that to the newborn you. I regret it now. I should've give you at least a flower for your birthday. I should've be able to properly tell you thankyou. Okaasan.. Do you have time for yourself? Things that you want to do, dreams about future or such things. You always think only about me. When you go shopping you only buy my stuff. You even didn't buy anything for yourself. You're a crybaby as always. I will soon have to go. Pull yourself together now. Nee Kyabetsu. I already tired. They said it's not humans who keep for cats. Cats who will always be by human's side. Take care of Kyabetsu. Will you? I understand. Ah I'm wrong. Kyabetsu, take care of this child. You who always worried and pondered about everything. But, you are the one who in the end can always find the right answer to all your worries. The good part of you. Please live without forgetting this. As long as you have that, you'll be happy, People around you also will be happy for sure. Hope that you will still have what you have owned now until forever. Thankyou. For what? Because of you, I can know that this world is full of irreplaceable things. That's why.. I won't erase cats. It's true that I'm afraid of death, but.. Forces me to realize Can I properly accept that and die? In this way I think that this is the truly happiness. You are me, aren't you? The other part of me inside myself. All this time I was talking to myself. With me who can't accept my death. Is that so? It doesn't bad to have life that ends with thankfulness. His hands shaking. Morning, Kyabetsu. Today is the last morning. To otousan. (To father.) You are the one who sent my mother's letter. Yes. I kept it for her. She asked me to give it to you when you seem to be in troubled for something. I refused it first, but she said it's okay as long as there is someone who hold that letter. That was it. I'm so glad I've meet you. What should we talk in this time? As long as there is a good story, there will always be someone to talk. Only with that life isn't something to thrown away. *Another movie's title.* Umino Ueno Pianist. I'm glad I like movie. Because movies.. have sent my best friend to me. To otousan. If cats disappeared from the world.. How would this world changed? If I disappeared from the world.. Who on earth would sad for me? Let's go home, Kyabetsu. If I disappeared from the world.. dreams and wishes that I couldn't think about.. things that I couldn't do when I'm alive, and things that I want to redo.. And there must be many regrets left behind. But the world where I existed and the world where I vanished.. I want to believe that it must be different. It may an insignificant change.. but that the proof that I'm alived. I'm going to live my life! Struggling and worrying.. The proof that we're alive. Keep it as secret from mother. Just like Retasu. This time is Kyabetsu? *read: kyabetsu* (Cabbage) Welcome, Kyabetsu. I'm home. You weren't coming at all I've repaired this Look! Thankyou. Thankyou for being born to this world.
