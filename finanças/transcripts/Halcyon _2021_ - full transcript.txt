Dear press members, camels are slaughtered in Australia: exterminated, killed... As is demonstrated here, we place a lot of importance in them. I kindly urge you to notice this fact. I remember going to the village on a lovely, sunny day. While my mother and the other women were doing the house chores; as men of the family, we were onto something I didn't understand entirely. I helped my father dig a small hole. I learned how to hold the shovel, dig the earth, and throw away the soil. I learned these things. Then, a few other men brought a cow behind a small truck. Aksehir Municipality Livestock Market. Welcome, welcome, welcome! Take your pick — 1000 Lira! Come on boy, come on boy, come on! Move away, mate! Mankind, mankind. On the days of greater Eid, you can't find a better job, there is no better religious service than sacrificing an animal. That means there is no need to fuss. Sacrifice, yes — the ritual of sacrifice is the most beautiful thing for us; it is the best thing we do. Through these sacrifices, we proclaim once again that we embrace the sincerity, loyalty, and devotion that is expected of us by the almighty Allah. Uncle! Stop the engine! Come on — bring that here! Enough. Lift it down like that. Drive backwards a bit! Drive backwards a bit, man! Okay! Stop. Stop the engine and come here, brother. Shall I bring the knives as well? We have knives here. Come down— be quick. Mehmet, let me see your strength, boy. Here we go. Allahu Akbar! Allahu ekber. I watched the cow's life pour into the hole we dug with my father and disappear. While I was standing there alive with my little body, that majestic animal was lying motionless on the ground. I remember making up an excuse and leaving. Then, I was called back to have my forehead painted with blood. The sun is about to rise. I become aware of my own body. I feel as if my limbs are redundant. I don't know where to put my hands or my feet. It is so weird to be myself. My dearest. I would die for you. I am in a place that looks like home. I want to go out, but as soon as I reach for the shoe cabinet, I notice there is a baby goat inside. When I try to take the baby goat out, cats—which I didn't realise were there before— scratch my hands. I pull my hands out in pain, then try again. This time, even more cats scratch my hands. I start to smack them away: one, two, three… Every cat I hit crashes against the wall and falls down. I try once again, but whenever I put my hands inside, I encounter more cats. Even though they are not strong enough to stop me, there are too many of them. I can't reach the baby goat. Then I go out to the balcony to watch the sunrise. Get off! Why are they kept separate from these ones? My dear, they're nursing. My dear, they're nursing. Sorry? They're sucking their mother's milk. If we let them be, they'll recognize their own mother and drink her milk. Well, don't they have to nurse? I mean... If they drink all the milk and there's none left, what are we supposed to milk then? Itır, İnci, and Sümbül are left behind. You brought Bunak and he fled. That's all I know. Why is this one fleeing? Come here, come, come… As if she has never seen anyone, my gosh! Oh! Rojda Mete, do not deprive us of your light. Oh! Xızır… Whatever is left in the forest, outside, in the wild, in the world, in the neighboring world, give it to us, to the poor, on a rainy day. O! Rojda Mete, do not deprive anyone of your light. Dersim, the land of all sacred things. The land of dervishes, owners of the grey moon. Claim your loyals. Don't make our children dependent on anyone but you. Give us relief. Oh! Rojda Mete! Don't let our elders dependent on anyone but you.
