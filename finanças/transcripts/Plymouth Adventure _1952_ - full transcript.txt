Hear, you come here. You're the Mayflower? - Master's main, Coppin is my name. - These passengers for the Mayflower? - Aye. - Any on board? None on board. - Rough are they, aren't they? - Aye. They want to pray this way, instead of this way. And they do not kneel, they pray standing up. They call religious freedom... and for that they're sailing away into a black sea of darkness. Will you search that cargo or been... spending here time watching the waves as they descend to us? - Will search the cargo. - Ah? - Here, you, what's your name? - Samuel Fuller William Button. John Carver, my wife. Stephen Hopkins, my wife, my children, my bonds man. William Bradford, my wife. - And you? - Mary Brewster. Love Brewster, Roaster Brewster. - Wife of William Brewster? - Yes. Where is your husband? I came from Holland with the others on the Speedwell. - And we had no words... - Speak out. Did your husband come with you on the Speedwell? - I've not seen him these many months. - Brewster is not been among us. He fled from Holland months ago, he's believed to be dead. And voyaging to the world alone? By the goodness of my neighbor, Mr. Bradford and my two sons... Why are we been questioned? We've all been clear for departure. Except William Brewster, we want your leader. The rest of you may go and good riddance to you. Passenger for the Mayflower? Gilbert Winslow, I've just down from London. May I give you a word of advice? This Brewster, this leader of the dissenters. If you are wise, you'd force him to go with us. It'll be easier to let them sink out there that to keep... him lock up in prison until he starves to death. This man won't starve to death, he'll hang. And there's 5 crowns reward for the fella who turns him in. 5 crowns, eh? - What he looks like? - Old man, white hair. Well, we must do something about this. This is the years of one round earth, when a young man... make up beyond the world's rim and live to see marvels. If he can keep his feet dry and the ship from sinking. Why are you going? I'm going because I've nothing better to do. I want to see for myself if there's really a new world or only the backside of the old one. - Does it take money to go? - If it did I shouldn't be here. I'm an impoverish tutor. Not quiet a gentleman but not worst than the other. No, there's not a drop of blue blood among my soul, scarcely a shilling. - Who pays for the ship and the provisions? - Investors. A Mr. Weston, representing the Virginia Company. It passes me how Mr. Watson and his investors expect to get their money back. They'd do and the profit. We going up a contract. In exchange for the money will give our labor for... 5 days of every week for 7 years in the new world. We'll harvest crops, trap birds, dry fish and the profits will be there. And for the other 2 days of each week we should be permitted to work for ourselves. Please all passengers... It's a rich country, 2 days a week is enough if you expect to find gold in your dori art. Seems we going aboard, we sail tomorrow. They're only waiting to hire 2 more sailors and a carpenter. - Good day to you, carpenter. - Good luck. Track for it. In halt. - Cargo loading is moving Mr. Coppin? - Hi Captain, but we be loaded dip. Fools, taken their wives and children with them, keep them out of my way. Get up board. Gentleman from London is been asking for you. - Where? - Yonder, the one in brown velvet. Sailing in the morning? - You came to say me goodbye? - Later. - Mr. Weston? - Captain Jones, won't you sit dowm? So we meet at last Captain Jones. Our correspondence has been must satisfactory but... as I wrote you, I have a small matter I wish to discuss with you in person. Not so small bring you from London to Southampton. In confidence Captain. What is your opinion of your passengers? You're paying me to transport them Mr. Weston. They are ravel, a ravel poppers... Running this obnoxious of wealth and adventures because... they believe the tall tales they've heard from the new world. And others running from the Church of England. Because they got some new notions to how to say their prayers. But there's one thing to be said for them, they'll made good settlers. Because they'd nothing to comeback to. They sold their home and spent the last shelling in equipments for the new world. As for the religious dissenters... they're very earnest and determined to see it through. And when you have a small group like that Captain... they're likely to infect the rest with their zeal. So they can say their prayers standings on their heads or their minds too. If the bottom near settlement, here. Oh, I don't understand, you must be mistaken. Your company, the Virginia Company, owns a track here, in this region. That's south of the 41st parallel. That's were the settlers will be landed? Do you know this other track? The cape Patrogen. Oh, that's of another company, New England Company. Captain Jones, you take your passengers to New England. But that's hundreds of miles north of the bridging agreed upon, by all parties. 100 pounds and another 100 when you return. The passengers are not to know their destination is been changed. Naturally, there'll be nothing in writing between us. And if ever in the future you speak of it, I'll call you a liar to your face. That's by all means, have a gentlemen agreement. Troubles you Captain? - Do you care where this people land? - I don't care if they land in hell. No, that isn't it, but there's another man who have to know about this. My mate, Coppin. He's a good navigator. We sail above the 41st parallel, he's bound to know it. - Coppin will have to be told. - I see. Yes, he'll have to be paid. - I'll see... - Is Captain Jones here? You're Captain Jones of the Mayflower sir? I am a carpenter. I'm a good carpenter sir, I've worked on the buildings of ships and I built houses. I'm a barreler too, a train cooper and I can read and write a letter. And I'm an orphan and not married. How interesting. I've never been to sea sir, but I, I'm a carpenter. You're a carpenter, you also had a drink too many. Oh, not today sir. Then what in the name of bladder and bills you talking about? I am told your hiring a carpenter. Not I, I have a full crew, I had the same ship's carpenter for 5 years. It's not a ship's carpenter they need. It's the passengers they're still short 3 men, they're putting them on today. They'll pay a man to attend to their barrels and... cast from the voyage and help them build houses in the new world. Sign on for one year, then return or stay if you will. See Mr. Martin at the Old Inn, he'd give you a paper to sign. Thank you sir, thank you sir Captain. - Get on with you. - I'll put in a word for you with Mr. Martin. - What's your name? - John sir John Alden. We lucky we shipping on the Mayflower. This other one, the Speedwell, is a tub of bones and she's rigged all wrong. But she's our consort vessel, she's sailing with us. Aye, she's over spot, a ballast won't take her, she'll be giving trouble. But the settlers are keeping with them for a year in the new world. - How many passengers she's carrying? - About 30 I think. Captain Jones of the Mayflower never carried no passengers before. - Oh, he hates them. - He's a blizzard, that man. Aye, his odd master. But a good sailor, you'll ride easier on this ship. You there. You, passengers were told to stay in the waste deck. Oh, I'm not a passenger, I'm not a sailor. I am a carpenter, I was hired... You were hire by that company of ride pickers, not by the ship. I wish yourself off the captain's deck or I'll help you. Why? Be right there. Next time I'll leave him over the side. Below. Where am I suppose to put my gears? Passengers look upon me as one of the crew and the crew thinks I'm one of the passenger. Oh poor laddy and that's makes real off and shy, don't you? Get below. I hired you to look out of this price... shoot the the rats and the passengers keep out of them, now get below. Yes sir. Human cargo this perch. They come from home, many of them, where they slept... in their own soft beds in their own clean rooms. What is it drives such men to adventures of this sort? The police. No, no alone that. No that alone. Here, here's my captain, It's not precisely luxurious but you welcome to half of it. I'll see what comfort there is below. John, this my elegant brother, Edward Winslow. This is John John... We are off to a meeting in the deck of box. Still you get with mine until you find your own corner. Who is she> The daughter of William Mullins, Priscilla Mullins. The only female aboard unmarried over the age of 10 good to look at. Christ-men cross, I thought it were rats. I've been sleeping I believe. Good day to you young man. Your pardon sir, I thought to make me my bed here, but if your... Take no notice of me my lad, I shan't stay here now. I've been having a nap, away from noisy children on the like. Children are a blessing, but they ram and yam an so. - Who are you young man? - I'm the settlers carpenter's. I came here for a quiet hour with the good book., - Great comfort in Scriptures. - But that's not Scripture. The People's Plead for a Free Church. - How now? A carpenter that can read? - It's a forbidden book, isn't it? You're a well informed carpenter. I never saw the book before this minute but I'm better inform now. I see. I'm a loyal subject of the king and guard fearing member of the church of England... Mr. Brewster. I'm going above now for the rest of my gear. How do you know I'm not going to turn you in for the 5 crowns? - Cause we're on the same pilgrimage each. - I'm in no pilgrimage. Every man on the ship is on a pilgrimage. To a spacious land where a man can set up a... trade without pulling down 2 of his neighbors. And need no pack his means from other's throat. Such a man can not be tempted by 5 crowns to betray a fellow pilgrim. - The settlers are all above in a meeting. - I'm not a settler, I'm a hired man. So am I, hired as a soldier to teach them the use of firearms. - John Alden. - Myles Standish. That don't last, set it to. - My wife Rose. - Delighted. Her last works seems to be tacking me, dosing me... - minding me. - Let's look at the meeting? Yes. Aye. As it was signed... all profits and benefits that are got by trade, traffic, trucking, working, fishing... or any other means of any person or persons... to remain still the common stock until the division, furthermore... if the agreement went off, we do by this presence solemnly and mutually hear by our fix our seals. And so forth and forth. Each man must sign. These are not the terms we agreed upon our discussions. Agree or not agree, this is what you to sign. I for one, one sign. And before you sign friends, reflect carefully on what you sign. Mr. Weston is waited until the 11 hour to present this agreement in writing. And now, it does not contain the terms that he promised us. He promised us that the homes we built... and the vegetables crops will be ours from the beginning. And only the profits from our labor will be divided by his company. But this paper says we're to work not 5 but 7 days a week. And everything produced, bought, grow or made in the new world... our homes and the tables and chairs we made for them are to belong to the company. This means that after 7 years Mr. Weston's... company can lawfully seize every stick and stone we're able to produce. You'll sign it, you'll sign it or I'll wash my Hans of the whole affair. But we can not sign our lives away, you're making puns way of the sort. Do as you please, you'll get no more from me, this is my last one. You'll stand on your own feet now, we all be. You can now you'll be sail Captain Jones. Close the door. He's left it in out hands. Now, I think I begin to see what he's doing. He's going clean-up of his head, that's what his doing. The money is already been spent for charter and supplies. His company's money, now he tosses all away. Mr. Weston suddenly makes the terms too difficult for the settlers to accept. In the name of the company he represents... he forces a quarrel and then he tears up the tie with it. Now there is no contract and no obligation on either side. But why? So it would be easier for me to land them in the wrong place. These are honest fools. With a contract they might insist upon been taken where they agreed to land. But now they have no contract. But he works for the Virginia Company, they pay his wages. It's a neat sham, and it's likely to make him rich. Oh, I don't understand. Get... another cup please Coppin. The new New England Company... The New England Company has never been able to gather enough settlers... together to make a permanent colony on Cape Cod. I've heard that the New England Company is bankrupt, now... without notifying his employers, as to his activities... Mr. Weston will privately and secretly... buy a, a bankrupt New England Company for small penny. When he will work his back to London, at either through accident or error... the settlers has landed on their land. Now, with good settlers, the New England Company will prosper. And Mr. Weston become rich, all at the expense... of his former employer, the Virginia Company. A deep bay infilsh. Hey, he hasn't paid us enough. No, we'll see to that when we return. - Mr. Coppin. - Aye, aye sir. Gentlemen gentlemen. We have no further time to argue back and forth. I'm ought we sail, without Mr. Weston's lead. But is the Captain willing to sail? I have no other to the contrary, I sail on the morning tide. Fools. Take ready to sail in the morning, I'm going ashore. Aye sir. ♪ I see the one-eye, they have one on the sea. ♪ - ♪ I have one the shore. ♪ - ♪ Sea and watcher. ♪ - Careful, old sailor. - Here we go lady. Give a hand old lad. - Farewell Maggie. - Good luck sailor. Now I'm unsteady, I'm full of these culprits. Oh now, there is a pretty girl. Well, is the very same, the very same, the one with the sad, beautiful eyes. - Let me go. - Why, there's nothing to fear us. - Let me go I beg you, let me go. - Why, she's blossom, all a quiver. Flesh and kindle. Hey, I'll make you my camera man and we'll have a nice couple of brandy, you and I. We'll punch a few fires. Oh, a skittish maid and as pretty as any that stroll the land. Married to that dove face Psalm singer who doesn't know the right... - kind of hymns to sing our way to... - Please Captain, you will let me go? Oh, you have to pretend your old fight, fight. I... Hymns and prayers are all you ever know. - That's all you ever... - Let me go. Let me go, I beg you sir, let me go. - Mister Clark? - Aye. - Mister Coppin. - Aye. - Mister Duff? - Aye. - Say pry your sail. - Very Weill, sailors... Passengers below. Clear that deck, stay below, your fill is bock for sailing. Sailor, place the advance sail. Anchor is up for now. Anchor is away. Set topsail. Set quarter main. - Rudder starboard. - Starboard sir. That's good, alright. - Ease the helm. - Easing the helm. Ready to go. August the 06, this is our first night at sea. I'm going acquaintance with my fellow passengers. It is possible to distinguish the religious dissenters... to the ones who are going for trade or adventure. Perhaps it is the preeminence and... neatness of the dissenters which they have made part of their religion. They've invented a saying, cleanliness is next to godnidessim. There someone tiresome about it. The others are a varied lot, farmers, weavers, tailors, coppers. Some are tradesman with the wisdom to see ahead the opportunities of the new world. In addition to the children of the settlers there are the street waifs. Homeless orphans, cast aboard by royal major of the populated London. The master of the Mayflower Captain Jones, had shown in many small matters... an attitude of unfriendliness toward the passengers. He sees insult in every clanks and accusations in every innocent word. Well, master William Button, you should be below and sleep. I'm going to be the first to see land, keep me up little while, then I be the first one. It'll be like the Garden of Eden and I'm going to be the first to see it. As for me... and the way the wind is blowing I should probably be the first... to be beaten by the snake that flocks in every Eden. - You well? - Had to see daylight. Mary is been warned, your name is John Williamson. - She's been told to... - Good morning. Good morning Mr. Williamson. Fine weather, eh? I hope it holds. Mistress Brewster... This is John Williamson, whom you may of heard. Mr. Williamson. - How much did he hear? - I don't know, he's no fool that captain. August the 15. We've been in sea for 10 days, our consort, The Speedwell has caused several delays. Putting back, trimming and mending. She's now once more beginning to laid behind. - She's signaling sir. - Answer he too. Confound slack package, she's given nothing but trouble since we started. - Ahoy Speedwell. - Ahoy. Captain Reynolds report. - We are leaking for an aft. - Can it be mended? - Not at sea. - Can you stay above with pumping? Aye, but I don't know how long. - Mister Coppin... - Aye sir. Break out the long boat. Greenhorn are on no form for my aft, I'm going over. Will you tell me the nature of the trouble Captain Jones? I'll report it to the passengers so that they may decide. I tell you the nature of the problem, you report it to the passengers and they decide? In the first place I don't know the nature of the trouble. In the second place, what I do know is I'll tell the passengers and I'll decide. I've inspected the damage and she's leaking like a sieve. There's only one thing for you to do and that's turn back once more for England. Hold, we're 100 lays from land's end. Speedwell should found on the way home all her passengers would've to go down with her. Because it happens to be room only for crew in her longboat. I care no more what happens to those passengers than I care about what happens to you. But if she sinks, I'll never be able to show my face in an English port. There you have it, we're going back with her. That's the nature of the trouble Mr. Bradford and that is my decision. We're once more back in England, anchored off Plymouth. Having lost many week since the Mayflower left London. If we ever sail again and there's now some doubt of that... this delay will bring us into the season of storms. - You asked to see us Captain Jones. - I asked to see the leaders. I take that you heard the news. We heard that the Speedwell can't sail again. Not for several weeks. - We don't understand these nautical matters. - Nautical? Captain Reynolds received the best part of his money in advance. He was to remain with the Speedwell and stay with you in the New World for a year. I never made such a bargain. Perhaps if I had, I would've done the same thing he did. - Then what did he do? - He broke the Speedwell hull Mr. Bradford. The Speedwell was over-spot, he knew that and yet he sail, there were too much canvas... so were the rigging too slack and now her... It's a matter of stresses on the hull Mr. Bradford. The tirses are wack, the seams are open, you've lost the Speedwell. That much we've heard. We discussed, all of this and we made our decision. Oh, you considered it and you've made the decision? This is our rightfully area of authority. Area of authority? On my ship I'm the authority. - But Captain Jones... - Mr. Bradford, did... I think you'll agree we have no choice but to sail again and at once. Will you permit us to transfer the passenger from the Speedwell to the ship? 18 passengers have chosen to remain in England after discouragements and the illness. But the rest are willing to share their foods and their space. You want the Mayflower to sail all alone, without a consort. You understand the danger of this? Afraid Captain Jones? Now, let's us have one or two matters understood before we sail. Sit down. I can give you no more space aboard the ship than you're already provided with. As far as food is concern, if you choose to starve, it's nothing I can do about that. Starving at sea is no worse than starving at England, you will have no ship of your own. You will have no Speedwell standing by during those long months, housing your woman and children while you build shelters for them. And no Speedwell to carry you back when you grow discourage and give up this adventure. I intend to land you and leave you there. And as for you the masquerade is over. You know that as the captain of the ship I have the right... to turn you over to the constables of the king. Well, I'm not going to turn you over. - Thank you Captain Jones. - Thank you. Keep your thanks to yourselves. There's so much mealy-mouthed kindness aboard the ship as sick as we have hear it. I'll god my word to truth you. You've nevertheless done me a kindness. I've done myself a kindness, I'm taking you along as a hostage. - Hostage? Against what? - Against trouble. So be fore warn gentlemen. If there is ever the slightest question raise by any decision I may make... I'll put his old gentleman of yours in irons, take him back to England and watch him hang. That is all. Why do you hate us Captain Jones? Why you so full of contempt for us? Because you are hypocrites, you talk fine about a new, clean world. What you're really dreaming up is getting rich. For the gold you'll steal from the savages. I grant you we may be common peasants and no better than any others. But Heaven is chosen to create around us a situation to which we must rise. Or die in ourselves, that's when men perform miracles Captain Jones. Be a miracle if only of them is alive after this. Evening Captain Jones. I gather we're sailing in the morning tide? We are this fog lifts. The people from the Speedwell are aboard now, I don't know where we store them. But we put together a new list of passengers. - How many in all? - 102. 50 men, 20 women and 52 children. More women and children than men. Sailing across an ocean into a winter wilderness with their women and children. I'm carrying a cargo of mad men.. You can make a world only with men. We are settlers Captain Jones, not explorers or conquerors. You are fools, that's what you are and liars. I can see through this clean new world talk. It's possible Captain Jones that you see no further than the end of your nose. - These are honest men. - There are no honest men. There those who try to be. I've lived long enough in the world to know what men are made of. There's the good of the world Mr. Winslow, the good clean sea. And my ship, my good ship. I put faith in my ship and she's never failed me. Don't put your faith in men and you never know disappointment. Perhaps, but then I could never know friendship or love either. Friendship? Love? - Lead out Jake. - She'll handle easy. Fishing ma'am? - Lord, she's got a whale. - Let me give you a hand dear. - Leave off, I'm helping the lady. - Will you please go away? Be laid there. - You go away, is she told you to go away. - I'm helping the lady. - I'll help you over the side. - I'm sorry ma'am. - Both leave me alone, both of you. - I saw her first. Be laid, be laid there. - Your father been seasick again? - Is to wash me. Oh mistress Mullins, you can't wash you with sea water. - Superstitions. - Seawater won't take soap. It will crack your skin open and the winds will do the rest. Can't be helped, we're not given enough water to wash our hands. You will wait it rains again, I take you plenty of nice soft water. It never going to rain again, we've been 8 days without it. We all smell like pigs. Oh, I must remember staying down wind from you then. You're not too bad, not like the sailors. - Haven't you fill that bucket again? - No. But if you must wash I get you some water, come on. Until we land I must see that every tonel and barrels they mustn't leak or go bad. - That's beer. - It's a important one. Trading goods for the savages, knives and bracelets. Here is water. That's oats and that's smoked beef over there. And this is a printing press. I may not know about your beer and your beef... smoked but I do know about this printing press. It was brought from Holland, is the reason in a way for this whole voyage. It was on this very press that Mr. Brewster... and the others printed those books that made us exile. Now I show you where I live. I found me a snot place. Come on. It's the rope locker. It's so quiet here. Aren't you ever afraid so far from the others? It's nothing to be afraid of. I've seen the sailors looking at you. - And I don't like it. - I don't like it either. - But you're not different from the others. - Oh, but I am, I am. How you different? Because you like me, that's the importance difference. Let me carry it for you. Oh no, no need, no. Stay where you are. Father come looking. Hey, that's not salt water. Water from the see don't make a lather like that. - You've been washing clothes, eh? - Keep your hands of me. To good for a sailor, eh? But not too good to use of his drinking water. Now you come with me. Is a lady who's had a bath with our drinking water. Now we know how someone would kept their faces. You forgot to knock when you came in Mr. Cobbin, get back to your watch. Aye sir. I could punish you for this. I did to wash my face and my hands and little bit my neck. And I washed the cap and collar. All this cleaning and scrowing was learned in Holland... now a good Englishman doesn't mind a little dirt, sit down Mrs. Bradford. You see, the passengers and crews have separate storage of food, but... water is common to the ship and if it's run dry we all go thirsty. I promise not to us the drinking water again Captain Jones. Of course, there's always a little water to be found for friends of the captain. - May I go now? - No not yet. The laws of the sea requires I punish you for this... I'm quite decided what the price of the water should be. If you going toss me over the side and feed me to fishes... do it now and spare me this cat and mouse game. When I start feeding the fishes Mrs. Bradford there 1 or 2 others who'll go first. What is wrong with you people? Why can't you be civil and agreeable? What's wrong with you sailors? You give the women no peace. My sailors are not use to see women strolling int he deck. You mustn't be annoyed with them if the get out their hands the times. Remember they're men. Although I'm not to sure that you would know a man if you saw one, married as you are... I'm not obliged to listen to this. You're obliged to live in a 90 foot vessel with me. And there are some things we charge inevitable lady. - Inevitable? - I can see it all, just like a south sail. You've never been on a long voyage. Weeks and weeks in closed quarters with nothing to do and very little to think about. All with the liquid sea moving beneath you, setting you stern... telling you that you're alive. I don't need to feel my blood to tell me I'm alive. By the time this voyage ends, this ship will contain not 102 passengers and... 30 crew men, will contain 132 cats and dogs, 132 robbing peace.. Is the sea that does it, the closeness of all together. You'll sea it. So, you and I may just as well meet out choice early. Best choosing the best. It assure ourselves a very pleasant journey. What a foul man you are. Tom Tinker's boy is ill, you should visit them. - Oh yes. I'll go. - Not now, tomorrow will do. I understand there some unpleasantness in a matter of water. Where is the? Here. We must try to understand the problems of the ship Dorothy. The rules must be obey. And I should try to keep out of the way of the sailors. There was probably some justice in whatever occurred... but it may have been an embarrassment to you. Don't wait for me, I may be late. I'm meeting with the others, we'll talk about rations... September the 15. Today Captain Miles Standish is making his most... earnest effort to teach us the use of firearms. But I suspect that we shall never be soldiers... for we grow clumsier and more baffled with each new command. Now again and this time all of you do as I do, shoulder your musket. Put in you muskets. Arm your musket. Recover your musket. Fair your musket. Go for the Scottish dirk. Recover your Scottish dirk. Return you Scottish dirk. Halt, halt. I laugh you barrel life laughing stake no just scotch long us. But if you don't attend to me now, you'd wish you have when... savages and wild beast fall on you in the wilderness. I shall now load the musket with gunpowder. Observe me first and do nothing. This is gunpowder. Open your charge, charge your musket. Put in your ball. Go for your Scottish stick. And ram your ball home. Return your scouring stick. Hoist your musket, mount your musket. When you go arm, you will carry your fuse lightly. It is apply to this cocking piece. When you pull the trigger it is release... downing to the flash pan, the powder ignites... bangs through the shock-holds... Explodes the powder in the barrel and the ball flies forward. Carrying destruction. Now, attend me carefully. Prime your pan and shock-hold. Guard, blow... and open the pan. Go for your wick... and blow on the cold. Straighten musket. Present... give, fire. I was a boatswain when Captain John Davis, god bless him, were lost in his grace. Have you been to the New World too? Not in Virginia where we be heading, but to the fishing off of Cape Cod. - Indeed you Se savages? - That I did, we brought 3 home with us. All smear with grease they was. Naked that make you blush. We tried to put decent cloths on one of them. But they had a lead into a chicken feathers. I'm going to be a king in the new world and I'm going to be the first one to see land. I swore I've never make this voyage again but here I am. The last time weeks on weeks we plowed south by west. And again and again heavy seas and headwinds drove us back. All our spars were carried away. - And dying men gathers without end. - Spring us some more cheerful young sailor. Tell us of the mighty rivers and warm sands. Palm trees. If you think you'd be seen palm trees and warm sands... and leaving a live of ease, let me disavow you right now. Why, it'll be a cold winter world, where fine words... will be useless and your saints will be a burden. A world in which only men of brung and blood will survive. A world in which each men will have to be strong enough... to care for the women they have drag like cattle into the wilderness. At last the autumn voice of the Atlantic is come bellering out from the horizon. The passengers remain huddle in the crowded tween-deck and all the hatches are close. With the wind and the assault of the black water of the weather had grown suddenly cold. As for the Eden I dreamed of, it seems it is not to be. But they have found theirs. He's appointed himself as her watchdog and guardian. I know of no sure sign of love in a man. Young William Button, who plans to be a... king in the new world has been taken with lung fever. - Watch your helm, hold her steady you don't. - Steady sir, steady. - Flow up and sail Mr. Coppin. - Aye, up sail. Up. - Take him to spritsail. - Aye, take him to spritsail. Highly a aft. - Stake away that. - Stack away. - Where we all? All fast, all fast. - Holding fast sir. Cooper, here, Where are the broken spar? You up there, bring a seal, Young, Young... Young, my son. Young, Young, Young... - My son, he's gone on deck again. - Alright, alright, I'll fetch him for you. Young, Young, Young... - Mother, here I am. - Bradford Bradford. Go below. Get below you blubber-head, get below. Held a hand. Yeap, blubber-head, now get below. Fix the line. Big fields coming, hold tight. I can mend it sir, there's something down in the cargo hall that would do it. - What do you got there? - A printing press. A printing press? Leave... Now. Water on this hose. Leave... Now... Go on. With God's mercy, we had weather the great storm. Till our deck are quarters are cold, airless and moldy with moisture. Many passengers are bedded with the fevers and injuries of the storm. Captain Jones, there's something I should like to say to you. Thank you for saving my husband's life. You know as well as I do if I had my wisdom by then I let him drawn. I'm not wiser and at least won the married. I know that and so I must thank you. Why you done it. October the 2nd. The days go by each like the other and it grows... difficult to believe we should ever see land again. At times it seems that for weeks we've not moved at all. For there's always the same horizon, the same cold pitiless circle. A son was born today to the wife of Stephen Hopkins, he was named Oceanus Hopkins. October the 7th. Firewood is growing very short... we have a fire every 3rd day and cook enough for 3 days and eat it cold thereafter, October the 10th. The scanty food, the airless quarters and the endless darn cold are taking their toll. October the 14th. We've almost forgotten what is like to be without the pains of hunger. It is not difficult to understand why the children remains... sturdy while their mothers grow weak and thin. Who's there? It's Coppin stealing food. - I've been spoiling for this. - Will teach them. - Dirty scum. - Get a poor sailor, will you? Coppin. Go below. Get below. Back to your quarters. October the 29th. We sail on and on Southwest by West moving slowly under short sail. Captain Jones is been easing his ship... cautiously along since the breaking of the beam. He does not dare to move faster yet there is desperate need for haste. For our drinking water is very low and there is firewood enough for only 4 more days. The sailors blame the settlers for the delay as they're... brought us into winter and short rations. November the 4th. Scurvy has began to show it's hideous symptoms among passengers and crew alike. The seed of death has been planted. In some hope is dying. Our firewood is gone and the water will last only a few days. November the 6th. The lamps in the Captain's cabin burn late. He sleeps at odds hours and holds himself more and more apart, a lonely man. You coming to thank me again Mrs. Bradford? The time for lies is over, I know how is for you, I know. You came here half hoping to meet... me only to pass me on the deck and see the need in my face. That's what good women like you feed of. But the time for that is over too, we've missed the time for taking. I have a feeling we're all doom Mrs. Bradford. Your adventures and your saints and Bradford with his frenzy religion and... you with your sense of duty that have you bleeding at the soul. My scurvy ridden crew and the empty water tasks, last prove of food. And my broken ship. And my nights alone with this hunger for you that will not leave me. Perhaps it will end soon in the dark sea and good riddance to us all. You are not alone in this. What make you think only you can feel? Others had known the hunger you speak of and live to tell of it. Yes, they never to tell of it. And one thing more. - I get to your secret. - What secret? That you have a heart, that there's goodness in you. And that you die rather to admit it. You say you know how it is for me. Well my captain, I know how it is with you. What you feel isn't anger and loading. It's despair, despair because the dream is about to perish out of fulfillment. Because this beauty is about to be lost. Wednesday, November the 8th. We've been at sea for 64 days since leaving Plymouth and 96 since Southampton. The weather has grow warmer and the sea gently during the past 2 days. For these 2 days the captain has scarcely left his upper deck. Fog has been heavy and there is no wind. Encouraged by the warmer weather, a few passengers adventure above deck. What have you there Sibby? Look, Sibby found a bird, dead dead. - A thrush is, I think. - A land bird. King Button. See what we brought to you. It's a land bird. It means we'll soon be seeing the shores of Virginia. Poor land bird. It flew too far from home. We therefore commit the body of our deceased brother William Button to the deep. To return in the corruption looking... for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead. Ho, land, ho Land... Land, ho... - Far away, - Too close, further right of bow. - Starboard cap Mister Coppin. - Free traces. Looks most barren, Miles of sand. That's bit of sand is only Cape Cod... there's a good snug harbor in the other shore of the bay. - Is Virginia over there in the bay? - We no way near Virginia. I've been here before with the fishing fleets. This is New England, Cape Cod. The captain will likely put in here for water and firewood. And then sail south to the Virginia shore. I've read the books of Captain John Smith, he wrote much of New England. If this is it, we're still hundreds of miles north of our destination. They are coming. They coming mister Clark, did you lock away their muskets? Aye sir. - Good morning gentlemen. - Good morning Captain Jones. Sit down. And mister Clark, pull up a chair for our visitors. You asked to see me? We noticed the long boats it's been on ship Captain Jones, that means you're... sending a party a shore for water and fuel, is that all? Aye, that it does. Is it possible that we may be off New England Captain Jones? This country is ever be as good as Virginia. That strip of land you see conceals a very good harbor. Well, the sooner you get your shelters built, the better chance you have for survival. Besides, I can't risk another hour of sailing in my ship in this condition. Are you suggesting that we settle here? No, I'm not suggesting anything, I'm telling you that this is where you going to settle. But what with your contract with the Virginia Company. This is not the territory of the merchant who paid our way. No, that may well be, that may well be. But you would do well to remember your lead... taken of Mr. Weston in Southampton, he's for you, he's cutted you a drift. You're under no obligation to him nor I to you, I've done my duty. I have delivered this cargo sons, seniors and babies and there is an end to it. Explore the other harbor. I'll stand by while you do it, in meantime I provisioned again my ship, then I go. And this for you Mr. Brewster, I haven't quite decided what to do about you. You remember the constable still wants you. So, if there's any trouble about this matter where you land... I'll leave here with you and maybe one or two others hanging from the order. I don't know why you brought us to New England... Captain Jones when you knew we were bound for Virginia. Accident? You're too better navigator for that, but here we are. And here we intend to stay. We decided that before we enter this cabin. We're staying not because you are threatening and... pulling us here for some reason of you own. But because we wanted that way. This region is better for us than Virginia. Because is not so close beyond the domination of the king and church. Here we will have even more freedom. I'll go reasons don't concern you Captain Jones, I know that. And what your reasons were, we may never learn. But let me tell you that if we'd decided to land elsewhere... not all your gun and cut-asses would stop us. And if you think you could take Mr. Brewster back to England with you, you're mistaken. We are men well accustomed to fighting for our lives. Think you don't know that. But what we know of you, makes us pity you now. For the comptentable weakness that greet us here with guns. Call off your dogs. You laugh too much Mr. Cobbin. The company we've pledged to serve has no rights in this territory. None and every man can take as much land as he pleases. - We'll divide the food and the gunpowder. - Aye, we'll take our chances on that. We starved and frozen for weeks, we're free now. I'll thrust my own strength back to get me my own part of living. - Give each man... - Hopkins Billington I beg you to hear me. This would not do, some form of government is needed here. - What sort of government? I need to rush... - Wait Billington. What is the deadliest danger we now face? Hunger, wild beasts, savages? No, the deadliest danger we must face is that we may disagree. If we may each go groping in the wilderness by himself alone and so face quick destruction. And you will. It is possible here to revise old institutions and start a new system. Of a perfection and excellency that still unknown to feed our infant society.. But until such government can be devised, we must agree to stand together. Let's us therefore sign this Mayflower commit. By which we all agree, irrespective of religion or former condition... to unite in one body politic... and to obey all laws, which will be necessary for all of us to make. What say? It is this or anarchy, and anarchy means disaster. We are not alone in this room, god is in this room. For whenever a man goes upward... he takes another step to also prove fulfillment of the god's head that lays within. What say, you gentlemen? - I say aye. - Aye. Governor John Carver. William Bradford. Whether they know it or not, they have laid hold of great principles... hided to unrevealed to the nations of the Earth. They're about to establish just and equal laws adopted and administered by the people. A government based on the will of the govern. John Alden, a hired man, grateful for the privilege of signing. Isaac Allerton William Brewster... Myles Standish. Samuel Fuller Richard Warren. Stephen Hopkins, Francis Cooke. Thomas Rogers. Edward Fuller. Francis Eaton. John Billington, Christopher Martin. William Mullins William White, Some are bonds slaves, some can not write. But they make their mark with earnest pride. James Children, Degory Priest. Brown... The Mayflower has been move into the harbor of New Plymouth. Today, some of the men are setting up on a long and hazardous... exploration to find a place for a settlement. They planed to be gone for several days. They carry bundles of beads and mirrors against the chance of encountering savages. In the hearts of those who remain behind lays the feat that theses husbands and fathers... may never be seen again. - Dorothy? - Yes William? Many things had happened on this voyage. But if this exploration succeed there will be a new world and a new beginning. And what happened aboard ship will be forgotten. And forgiven. I wanted you to know that before I go. Now, I wanted you to know you have fill my life with sweetness. - Bradford William Bradford. - God keep you William. Here, at last, the beginning. This lonely boat be in beach in a cold and empty coast. I do not know if anyone will ever learn what was done here today. But if one of us survives, this day must be remember for the courage of these... weavers and haters, these carpenters, Taylors and tradesman. Shivering in their city clothes, frighten. Setting forth into they not know what, holding guns they scarcely know how to shoot. Ragged, foolish looking and weak as they are, they have the true splendor of man. They'll be save, they'll return. Now go to bed. I've heard it said Captain Jones is going to take the Mayflower out of here. Back to England as soon the man return in the long boat. It can't be true, he can't leave us without shelters. - Is what he plans to do. - Is there no way to that man heart? You can't take the ship back to England. Before we sail I made it clear that's what I must do. If you remain until our shelters are built some may live out this voyage. If you go it is certain they'll die, every last one of them. - They choice that, I warned them. - I ask you to stay. And I ask you to come back to England with me. This is no place for you, what do you know of building new worlds? I have no dreams of a new world, make no mistake. But here or there, my place is beside William Bradford. No. This is where you belong, here. No. - We'll sail away together. - No. - Where else is we be able to love... - There is none. When? - After we married. - No. - There's nothing between you two. - Yes, there isn't between us too. The years of understanding. He feels more than the others show, my feelings for him run deeper than you know. This is wrong., It's just as wrong leaving beside me and thinking of me. I know. I could never be happy in a runaway life with you remembering him. You can't go back to him, you'd never belong to him again. That I know too. But somehow I lost it, somewhere between you. Let me go now, let me think about it. Let me go. - We found it, a perfect harbor. - Perfect, it's warm. The ground is good too, even in December and a good rich soil. It's a shelted harbor, with a large rock risings from the water. It's the very place that John Smith called Plymouth. There is a hill which rises thus and there is a good stream here. We can built our fort on the hill and our settlement along the stream. There is a plentiful supply of leonburguers size of wild game that if... Three nights ago, the night you left. Not if in her own free will, she would not have broken god's commandments. We can only believe she felt over when no one was about. Captain Jones, the men appointed me to ask you again. How much longer do we stay here? The ship ready to sail, there's no gold here, nothing but beavers and clams. And sickness, the crew said they feel they're taking the sickness... from the settlers, lung fever is beginning to spread. They'll get out of hand sir, when do we sail? Let them die, the whole unlawful, blasphemous look on the noose lot of them. You wasn't so worry about them when you took Weston money to drop... what makes you side with them now? Look in to your face and look in to theirs. Stay by with your friends... and look at that mealy faces, we're going home, we done enough, We're taking the Mayflower out of here. Now, who else threaten mutiny? Clear the deck, step back to your posts. April the 4th. The winter is over, the land is a bloom and nature's bleak face begin to smile again. Of the 102 who landed here, 56 remain. 6 died in December, 8 in January, 17 in February, 13 in March. All taken by the sickness. A combination of scurvy and lung fever. But now this plague is over and our hopes are high for the future. The Indians have prove gentle, poor, friendly and often hungry like us. If only in this we are fortunate in having settled here in New England... For in Virginia the Indians are murderers of hate for the white man. And all these months Captain Jones has kept his Mayflower standing by. Providing us with shelter and comfort during the long winter. Until out homes were built, without that we have perish. All of us. We who through god mercy survive the sickness... Are gather to say farewell to Cap Christopher Jones, who sails tomorrow for England. We wished this token could be of thing of greater value. But there's nothing of much value on the shore. Sir, perhaps what we hold in out hearts for this matter. To Christopher Jones, master of the Mayflower who's fidelity sustain us and kept us alive... during our first winter on the shores of America. We give our thanks and our friendship... until eternity. This scroll is inscribed with the names of all, even our latest settler. Mater Peregrine White. I, I had spoken with your leaders and... and we have an offer to make to you. Any of you who wishes to return to England... I shall carry you back. My ship will be traveling on short rations, the food will be scarce but... probably no scarcer than it will be here until your crops are harvested. So, if any who wish to go will appear at dawn on Plymouth Rock. You'd be taken aboard. I wish you all good fortune. And I want to thank you for what you've taught me. The growth of the human spirit bring him closer to all living beings. I was alone. Now I'm with my fellows. There's so something I must tell you, I'll be brief about. - I loved her. - I knew that. There's something you may not know. She loved you in a way she never love me. In a way which I never understand then, but she never betrayed you. Thank you. Thank you. Do you realize the wonder of it? That a handful of sick and dying men had built a settlement that now... not one has appear to ask me for passage back to England I'm glad we didn't disappoint you. I suspect that you too were on a pilgrimage whether you knew it or not. Searching for what? A glimmer of hope for your discourage heart? I see the sails. I can see the sails, 2 then 5, then fleets come here to join you. I'll be in one. I must go. God be with you. Fire a salute. - For living and the dead. - Aye sir.
