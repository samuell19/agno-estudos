I thought, "Hey I should buy that!" But I didn't have any money So I was like, "What should I do?" Can I have a hot dog? Could you wrap it for me? Tonight, at least from now... Tonight, at least at this time... The things you lose won't come back. How sad! Wake up this morning... Stop it! Hey give it back! Let go of me! Let go! Make her eat it! Eat it! Wait! You're the worst! Let go! Stop it! Get off me! Leave me alone! I've gotta go, I'll do it next time. Later, later, later. Ugh, I'm beat. - Only that much? - Seems about right. They're the devils after all. - Want some? - Thanks. Great job today! Hey out of the way he'll sign it later. - Good job! - Today was so great! - Great job guys! - Good job, let's go! This guy You always get all smiley right about now. - Alright guys, let's cap it off with a round of beer! - Alright! You know her? Shingeki? What's a shingeki? Hunt's got sooo many friends. Fujito - 19 years old - Well, see you guys tomorrow. - Bye! Tomorrow we start from 12:00. Don't be late! - We've got the Gravia shoot. Good job today - Good job! Hunt - 23 years old Sagara - 22 years old Aki - 20 years old Hello? It's me. Why didn't you come? No, I'm nearby It's no trouble, I can come by You're putting me in a tight spot. Where are you? I'll come to you. Wait for me. You're such a bother. I'm busy Hey come on! Let's go to a hotel. - I don't feel like it. - Why not? Are you dumb? You sound like a little kid. Your place is just as good. Come on. You're hopeless. I don't care how restless you are, I won't do it. You just fall asleep immediately afterwards anyway Hey let's go to a snack bar. I'll buy you something warm to eat before you go home. I'm not hungry! Come on! Let's just do it! Go in. Bring your shoes with you. Don't. Come on, that doesn't matter I told you, I don't want to. Don't let it slip out! You know what? What? I'm seeing someone. I was thinking of telling you but it was hard to say He's a senior at my college. He'll graduate this spring and he's already got a job lined up. I really like him. You could have applied to a Tokyo college too. But I guess I've changed over two years as well. So you hate me now? No, I just can't keep following you. Everything was great when we were in Osaka. At the Nakanoshima concert over 500 high-schoolers came. But, the world of music is tough. We made a record but it never made any money I don't even know how many we sold. Maybe we made 100,000 yen or so? Just barely enough for buying a TV. That may be true, but I'm following my dream. Someday I'll make boatloads of money I'll fill the Budokan concert hall with fans and tear it apart with our shredding rock music. Just go home. You understand how I feel. Go, I'm busy I've got a report to write. How am I supposed to go home with the train not even running? Just take a taxi! I don't have that kind of money! I'll lend it to you. 5,000 yen should be enough. Oh yeah, and take that with you. I'm giving it back to you. Can I still call you? Fine. H draws away, it fades away. Fantastic! Psychedelic! Oh, yeah! Hazily driving... Together, baby... Baby baby... Who is it? Hey! - Were you asleep? - Yeah, I was. What's he doing? I don't know, something. Alright, I'm going to mine. See ya. - Did you come up with that just now? - Yeah. It's kinda dark. What's wrong? Dark? What's dark about it? Well, it's not very lively Of course it's not lively! It's not supposed to be a lively song! Keep your eyes on the road. Look right. And accelerate. - That's too much! - Alright. Fujito. Hey... I know you. - I was eating the hot dog. - Hot dog? Yeah, that girl gave you some too. Oooh, yeah it was really good. Did something just happen? Wait a moment. Here you go. Actually I have a favor to ask. What's that? One of my friends is smoking, even though she's still in high school. Oh? Could you talk to her? If it came from you, I'm sure she'd listen. But what's so wrong with smoking? It's bad! Please talk to her. I'll bring her tomorrow. - Sure, it doesn't matter to me. - Really?! That's where you live, right onisan? - Onisan?! - Yeah. Yeah, it's OK if I call you that, right? Oh yeah, some people from a band in my store said they knew you. They said to come over anytime. You're more than welcome. You dope. What are you doing! Stop! Hey! Quit it! Not here! Hey you lent Hunt some money right? A while ago. 1,700 yen, right? I hate him. But since he's fun to be around I don't say anything. You lent him that money right? Hey Aki, what's wrong? What happened? You're such a dope. Here. Aki... - Excuse me, I'd like to pay - Yes. - How much is it? - It'll be 5,000 yen. - Please give me a receipt. - Yes. Here you go. Thank you! - Here it is. - What's that? 5,000 yen?! For a cut like that? Choose somewhere cheaper next time! I'll give you 3,000. Shizuka paid anyway right? - I know how you operate. - And then just the date and your name. Here. The song-writing fee. Mr. Aoki, this is impossible! This would pay way more as a single by other artists. Well, I already told you, if you deduct expenses, this is what's left. How am I supposed to know that? You've gotta make it clear! You think you all are in a position to complain? Do you have any idea how much it costs to run this show? Your apartments cost 100,000 per month. There are advances, maintenance fees for the instruments and car, transportation fees, hair dye... And rent for the recording studio. However you try to out you all are costing at least 10,000,000 yen! And how many records have we sold off the last recording?! That's because the promotion sucks! What do you know about it? Stick to performing! If you're in a position to complain, why don't you just yell out and bring 1,000 fans running? If we could get 1,000 people, we'd be set. You shouldn't say it like that. Explain it to us more clearly I already told you, take away expenses and this is what's left. How does 10,000,000 yen become 12 yen? You probably thought we were doing well bringing in 10,000,012 yen. You're on your own? What about your friend? My friend? Oh, she said she would be too embarrassed meeting you, so she won't come. Welcome. What do you want to eat? I don't have any money - It's okay I'll buy for you! - Well then, I'll take a hamburger. - Me two, two hamburgers. - Very well. Is it okay for you to smoke, after you were giving your friend such a hard time about it? Can you get me Dirty City by The Devils? The Devils? - You don't know Dirty City? Please wait just a moment. It's really him! He's so cool! Excuse me, could I get your autograph? Excuse me, could I get one too? Me too, please. Excuse me ma'am, it seems that we aren't selling that album. Hey! Hello, it's been a while. Did you sell out? It seems that we returned them. - What's wrong? - It's nothing... - I listened to your album the other day It was pretty interesting. - Thanks. - Good luck with everything. I hate people that are this arrogant! What fools The two who loved each other up until now Though they trusted each other Just look to the side... Hey today I met Yuya Uchida. He said he listened to our newest LP, said it was really solid. He invited us to come by his office sometime. Oh yeah? What happened? We only have this place until 10, so get back to it! Okay okay Guys, let's go again. Aki, from the top! What fools The two who loved each other up until now We shouldn't sit on the fence with it. Let's just bring it all at once! Yeah, but, if we want a melody that sells we should rethink it a bit. If you've got so much time to think things through then how about you think how to play a decent C? I'm just saying it could be better. We should rethink it. I wrote that song all at once and it was great, just like the others. Who are you to say it isn't cool? I'm not saying that. Then stop complaining! There's no talking to you! Fujito... ls there nothing you don't have an excuse for? What're you saying?! Exc-whatever! Stop using words nobody knows, old man! - Hunt! - What? - Jingai. - Huh? I'll teach you what they mean! You'll teach me? I'll show you! Who gets in a fistfight with the manager when we're talking music?! That hurt, you bastard. You all clatter around back here like you're big shots. But the lyrics suck! The music sucks! The performance sucks too! You're all fluff. Not once have you actually brought a crowd to scream together all at once! You find the time to grumble and complain. Meanwhile you don't have the talent The Beatles had in a single fingernail! Fuck you, asshole! Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Aoki... Hey we... You bastard! What are you doing, you bastard! Hello? It's Fujito. This is Fujito from Osaka. Is Hitomi there? Who the hell was that? I told you the other day that I'm seeing someone. - Your order? - A salty dog. Bang! How are they? Do you like them? Hey what's your name? - Tell me! - Just call me what you like. I'm putting out a record. Would you like to hear it? Hey want to get a drink? I don't really have any money I'm living on 50,000 yen a month. Really? You know what? I was born in America. - America? - Yes. And you know what? I went there! Sunset Boulevard 2719! Is that a car? - What? What's he doing? - No need! Sorry we don't need one! Thank you! - That scared me. - Yeah, right. And so, I fell off the stage during the set and ended up in the hospital! The hospital! Wait a second! Please wait a second. I'm really drunk. You'll get drunk if you don't eat anything. - Hey what's wrong? - I'm so tired. Don't fall asleep, wake up! Please, if you want money just take it. Wait, I'll do it myself. Ow! That's hot! Hey how about we jump? It'd be instant death. You wouldn't feel any pain, right? Will you jump with me? I guess I'm a scary woman. I can't go home anymore. Why? You're rich, no? Oh, that? I borrowed it from the Consumer Bank. I'd used up my salary Hey are you free today? You could meet me tonight. I can after 9 PM. Shut up! When will it end?! I was called on in front of everyone! - Oh, hi! - Hello. - Hey onisan, what do you think? - Come on, stop calling me that. It was really a big mess. But in the end, he forgave me! I wonder if he likes me. Hey go home already You'll get in trouble if you miss too much school. Today's Sunday! Oh, that's right. Well, our manager gets really mad if we bring girls here. - I'll leave at once. - I'll walk you. Well, goodbye. - I'll take you all the way home. - Really?! Hey come quickly! This is it, my house. A doctor's house? You're like a rich princess. But my parents are really stingy They only give me an allowance during school festivals or holidays. Pretty strict, huh? And they're so bossy with their discipline. My dad was a doctor too. When I played my first chord, he broke the guitar. Come on. If you don't want to, we can always do it another time. What are you doing? This is a place for people to do... that. Yeah, of course. Are we really doing it? Come on, you want to, right? Of course you do! I don't know. - Ne! “ Hey! Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why? You don't even know that much! “W.! - Let go! - Stop moving! Quit struggling. No! Stop it! Stop fighting back! Don't run! Stay right here! Get back here! I don't want this! Be quiet! Quiet! Don't move your legs. Stop moving them! Stop moving! I have to take your panties off! Come over here. Come here! Come here! Alright. Now stop struggling. Open your legs. Spread 'em already! Do it! Alright. Here we go. Hunt! Shizuka said you borrowed money from her? Be sure to return it. You should return things that you borrow. Alright guys, Aoki's here, so let's go. Huh? Where's Hunt? Oh. What about Fujito? - He said he'd meet us at the studio. - I see. Okay let's go. Can Fujito vote? No, he isn't 20 yet. Turns 20 next year, right? Sagara, who are you gonna vote for? The old guy at the fruit stand asked me to vote for Kanamori. - What about you, Aki? - I'm going for Kanamori too. Japan Minji Party Approved Candidate - Kanamori Shigeru By Kanamori, you mean the Kanamori right behind us? Japan Min)? Parky Approved Candidate - Kanamori Shigeru Japan Minji Party Approved Candidate - Kanamori Shigeru - Yeah, there he is. - Huh? Well he's in the way! Get him to move that truck. Hey everybody move! We can't get out! Are you mad? I've gotta get to practice, so I'm gonna go ahead. What's wrong? It hurts a lot. I feel like I'm bleeding. Let's go. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'll take you back to your place. - No, I'm not going back yet. - Huh? I'm not going back yet! If I go back now, I'll get caught. I'll go back a little later. Well come on then! Come to the studio with me! Devils are the best! What? Devils are the best! That bastard Fujito is late. Huh? Where's Fujito? Hey! Hey! Hunt! What's up? You made plans to meet up with someone tonight, didn't you? There was a phone call. They can't make it anymore. Said if you read the paper you'd know why Embezzling Office Lady - Missing Hunt, give the money back. - Huh? - You borrowed 1,700 yen from Shizuka, right? Give it back. You know I don't have any right now. I'll give it back later. You're terrible, always flirting around with girls. You're irresponsible! You're already 23, how about starting to save a little?! Look who's talking! It's the same with the guitar. Yeah, you're pretty good, but you've got no heart. You're the same with women. Have you ever dated anyone seriously? - Shut your mouth! - What are you gonna do?! You bastard! Let me go! Stop it! Somebody! Hey! Break it up! Wait a moment! What, are you gonna keep going till somebody's dead?! Idiots! Aoki, they're fighting, you've gotta do something! Stop! Somebody stop them! What are you so upset about? It's got nothing to do with you. Idiots! Break it up! Let go! I'm not finished with you! Sorry for being late. You idiots! I put all my heart into this band, but it's over! This band is finished! Well, you guys want to practice? No, I'm out too. I'm through with this band. Go ahead, quit! Hey Hunt. Hanto, please, I'm begging you. Just be a little patient. He)" If you weren't here, I wouldn't know what to do. Aki's one thing, but I don't know where I could find someone to replace you. Please, do this with us. We'll look for someone who can rock the drums better than Aki. We'll find a replacement. Really that's all I ask. Until we find someone to replace Aki? Yeah. Aki, come on, I'm begging you. We'll find someone that can shred a guitar better than Hunt. Yeah? Just be patient. We'll get rid of Hunt. Alright? Well? Hunt, come on! We're gonna start! Are we really gonna replace Hunt? I just said that. They'll make up soon enough. How the hell does this work? Did something happen? Hey did something happen? Okay let's do this! Check. Aaa, aaa, check. Silence, fight? Yeah, Silence, from the hook. The part with the hook. From there, there's an A-minor, right? Oh no, no, Silence. Let's go from there. Ready? Oh no, no, Silence Wait, it's a little different. Here, we go, waaa, fight? It's supposed to be a hook. We've got to bring it up a bit here. How many times do we have to do this? You guys are pros, right? Don't make us do this twice. Alright, one more time. Hey let's go to Hokkaido. Some small, cold town. We could be together, with no one else. It'd be the best. There aren't that many options in Japan. All that matters is that you get good. Hey hey hey right there. Where? What we just played. On the last accent, could you do a B-flat? A B-flat? The last part, like daaaa. I'll do it, listen. It broke... I'll go grab a string. I've only seen that happen like three times. I've never seen it before. Does my nose look twisted? Yeah, it's totally bent! That's a joke, it's perfectly straight. My voice isn't right. - Hey give him a tissue. - I didn't bring any There you go. Silence, silence. This one time. An unfinished dream. Passes through my heart. H's stained... This knife. Oh, Silence... Gather up the red roses. Oh, Silence. Silence! Looking back at the knife that's chasing you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Looking back at the knife that's chasing you. Oh yeah. Oh, Oh, Silence. Looking back at the knife, knife, knife. Silence, I love you! There's no silence. There's no silence.
