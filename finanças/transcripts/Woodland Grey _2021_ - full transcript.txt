Ah... ah. Ah... Hello? I should go to a hospital. You have to let me go. I need to leave! Arg! Ah! Fine. I'll stay. Ah! Thank you! I think... It's better. I'm Emily. I like your place, it's nice. It's quaint. I used to go camping with my grandfather. He had this stupid orange and blue tent. And it smelled like mould. Anyway, he used to make all kinds of things on the fire. It's a nice flavor. Mesquite, I think. This is really painful. You don't have Aspirin or anything? I had some in my bag. Hey! I had a bag! Where's my bag? Ah! Are you a doctor? Are you a paramedic? A nurse? I had to take care of myself. - Ah! - It's not broken. He speaks. I could go for a Dusty's triple cheeseburger right now. It's this place up in New Canaan. It's the best burger in America, Dusty's Grill. They marinate the patties for four hours and each one is just a little bit bigger than the bun. Even the cheese they use, ha a a a... Do you know where they have them? Just outside this fucking forest!!! Where are you from? It doesn't matter. Um... Do you like movies? What's your favorite film? - Okay, look, we don't have... - Mine's Casablanca. - Pff! - What does that mean? No, it's just... every girl... Oh you know other girls? Does some of them live in this forest? Should we invite them over sometime? Listen... I think we should talk about me heading out. - As soon as you're ready. - Tomorrow? It has to be tomorrow. I'm running out of time. You've got somewhere to be? Doctor's appointment. I can't miss it. I'll show the quickest way. Why do you not really look at my face? Stop it, okay? Okay. What's your favorite color? What's your favorite animal? Stop it. Stop it!!! Stop telling me every fucking thing in your head. It isn't necessary to tell me every fucking thought that you have. I don't need to hear any of it. I'm just a man, okay? Sorry!!! Sorry, again... Sorry... Sorry... Sorry. Sorry. Ah! Sorry! - Sorry! - Yeah... Oh my God! Moses Rafferty Memoirs, 1971. We were stationed at Khy Sanh. I'll never forget that night we did that recon mission with a son of a bitch; Sergeant Jack Goldfarb leading us out. We'd only gone a few miles when I realized we were going in the wrong direction. I didn't say anything. Goldfarb decided to... set up camp in a clearing. I guess I dozed off. Next thing I know, everyone around me hit the ground, but I knew what was happening. So, I hit the deck and I stayed still. I didn't make a sound. And out of the jungle came out all those Charlies. My heart was pounding, trying to burst out of my chest. You know sometimes, you can play hero and sometimes, you just got to suck it up and play dead. I was the only one playing dead. You know, you make decisions as you go a long, sometimes they come back to haut you. I should have said something. I knew we were in the wrong place. Tom, Goldfarb and the rest of the guys... lost like that. It doesn't... it just doesn't... heal ever. Sorry, peanut. It's okay. I guess that's good enough for today, you think? Yeah, of course, it's totally up to you. Hey, so when do you go up to this college again? In three weeks. I told you, they have a med school. The medical facility is all set for dialysis on campus. It'll be super easy for me. I can do this in between classes. Good. You know, the closest I ever came to biting it in the war was when we were disoriented. We all need something to keep us on track. We can't all be Bogart, smooth-talking his way around Casablanca. - Almost done. - Thank you. - No problem. I bought this compass when I got back home. Grandpa, you don't have to give me your compass. I'm being buried with this compass. It's going to help me find my way back to your grandma. So, you're going to be here tomorrow, right? Hmm-hmm. Yep, of course. Because Tyler's got a hot date. Oh! I will definitely be here. Thanks, peanut. Grandpa? Grandpa? It's me! Sorry I'm late! Grandpa? Yeah! This is good. Thank you! I appreciate it. Emy? Talk to me. What is happening? Nothing. I just need to clear my head for a bit. - I don't like this. - I'm fine. Back, I promise. We'll talk when I get back, okay? We'll catch up and stuff. Okay, how is that what I'm worried about right now? Can... Can I at least come pick you up or something? - When you're done? - I'll catch a ride back in a few days, seven tops, can't be much longer than that, doctor's orders! Got to get my fix. Thank you again. I appreciate it. - Fine. But if you're not back in seven days, you are a missing person. Seven days! I'm counting. No! Shit. Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Play dead. Ah! Stop... Stop it!!! Stop telling me every fucking thing in your head! I don't need to hear any of it! Sorry!! Sorry again... Sorry. Sorry... ah! Sorry! Hello? It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you. Hello? Oh my God! Shit! Hey, it's okay. - Stop it! - Hey! - What are you doing? - Don't fight me! Don't fight, just listen, just listen! - Stop it! - Just listen to me. - Stop it! - Shut up and listen, okay? - Get off me! - Stop fighting! Get off! - What are you doing? - Just for my own safety. I don't want to hurt you, I didn't do anything. You're lying to me, you're lying to me, you're lying to me. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Ah! I'm going to give you some options. And you need to talk about what you're going to do next, okay? You need to think about how you're going to react. - Get off me! - If you're willing to cooperate, I can walk you to the edge of the forest, because you're not going to make it out of here without me. Okay, you're going to be blindfolded because I can't have you direct people back here because of something you think that you saw. - There's a little girl there! No, there isn't! No, there isn't! Yes there is, I saw her! She's in there right now, what are you doing to her? - I only want to say this the way it has to be, okay? There's a little girl in there. - No, there isn't. - Yes! There actually isn't. There isn't. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you. Play dead. It's okay, just stay calm. Stay calm. It's okay. It's okay. AH! No. No... Okay, okay, you've got this. You've got this. You've got this. You can do this. Fuck you. Fuck you. Hey! It's okay, I'm tying you up for my safety, shithead. Don't do this. Hi! Hi! It's okay. I'm going to get us some help. I'm going to get us out of here, okay? Are you hurt? Hey, hey! Wait, come back! Come back! - Hey hey! - Oh! Fuck! Fuck! Look, you and I both know I can't in good conscience just leave that little girl alone here in the woods with you. - I know. - It's not what you think it is. - No? You tied me up. You locked a little girl in a fucking shed. - I know what I've done. Believe me. I didn't think anyone... could see her except for me. I... I... she just appeared. I know that doesn't sound rational. I know that. Okay? She just appeared. I don't even know if you're real. Are you? I need you to show me the way out of the woods. Did you hear me? And we're going to taker that little girl with us. That book. Second last on the right. It's her favorite book. Just read her a story. What's her name? It has no name. Hansel went on as before and strewed bread crumb all along the road. The women led the children far into the woods. Where they had never been before in all their lives. And again, there was a large fire and the mother said: 'Sit still there, you children. And when you are tired, And when you are tired, you can go to sleep. We are going into the forest, to cut wood. And in the evening, How long? How long did you have her locked up in that shed? Answer me! No! It's going to hurt you. I can take care of myself around a little girl, trust me. You should trust me too. Careful, the safety's off. - I know. I could kill you. Maybe you should. Are you okay, sweetheart? Sweetheart? Sweetie? Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah? - Are you hungry? - I don't know. You don't know? I can offer you um... some peanut butter. You and I are going to sit here no spoon, and straight up... we're going to eat some peanut butter. - Dad? - You just do it. And once you start, I think you'll find that you just... just difficult to stop. That's what I find. - Really? Get in there. Grab it! Straight in, get in there! - Okay. Put your hand in! There we go! Mmm! I find that if you just put your hand in... - Oh my God, dad! - Put your hand in! What are you doing? Getting food and water. I need supplies if I'm getting out of here. - Please don't leave me tied up here, alone like this. Please don't leave me! Please! Please don't leave me! Please! Please don't leave me! Hi. It's just me. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you. It's okay. It's okay. You're a missing person. - What? - You're a missing person. What is this? Hey? You left. And it did this to me. How is that even possible? It's going to burn me. - I asked you, I told you. - Maybe she hates you? Maybe because you locked her in a fucking shed. Did you ever think about that? - I don't know how long I've been here. It's a long while I think. But I saw it. Her. I saw her on the second day. First, I just thought it was a figment of my imagination, or it was just PTSD or something. I don't know I came. But it tortures me. It burns me. It makes me remember things! I built that shed for it. It took me two days to build. One day, I went down there to reinforce the roof and there it was, it was just... it was just inside. All I know is that when it's inside there, it leaves me alone. So, I just... I just locked it inside. I know this makes me look like I'm a bad man. But I'm not. I'm not. Not for this anyway. Not because of this. Okay... okay. Ah!! Hi, sweetheart! Hi. Sweetheart? It's okay. Oh! It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. So, you're going to be there tomorrow, right? Grandpa! No, no, no! I'm seeing things. I need to leave. I'll lead you out, but um... I'm not leaving. This is where I have to be, I don't have a choice. Okay. Let's go. How long would you say I've been out here? I'm not sure. When I found you, until now, maybe five days. - Your doctor's appointment. - Yeah. I got bad kidneys. I've got to clean those suckers out every few days. I can go seven max, but after that, it's a crap shoot. Who camps on dialysis? Who lives in the woods alone? Snare. We can use this. This way. Is this how you normally do this? It's not always a stick. It's a miracle you catch anything the way you do. Self-taught. I catch food every time almost. It's impossible. This is all wrong. You've been set in these for years, I take it. I told you, my grandfather was a good teacher. Look, this part is too big, you need to... Guess I'm a miracle man after all. Thanks. Empty. What is this? How many traps did you set? - Maybe five or six tops. I don't know. It's a distraction. We need this. We need this, we need this. Wait! Wait! Hey! What are you doing? I miss you, sweetie. What is that? It was her favorite. Stop fucking with me! Leave me alone! Fuck you! Leave me alone! Fuck you! Fuck you! It's happening again. You know, the whole thing. The whole thing is happening again. Do you see that? It's happening again. The whole thing, it's happening again. No, no no no no no! No! She just keeps taking, just keeps taking. No! Fuck! She just keeps taking. Keeps fucking taking. No, no! - No! - What's happening? She's burning all of her stuff. She's burning all of her stuff. Fuck! - Fuck! - What? No, no! Fuck! I'm a missing person. I'm a missing person. I'm a missing person. I'm a missing person. I'm running out of time. I feel it. I have to go home. Tomorrow. You'll go home tomorrow. We should go. Hey, seriously! You said you had a bag. Are you at all curious what this is? All of this? - I know. - What is it? - We're sleepwalking. You honestly know? What I know is in constant flux. Where exactly did you find me? It's not far. What were you doing when you put it down? Well you know, walking around. Hoping to trip and fall, crack my skull, dislocate my knee. Carried away by a stranger in the woods. Are you sure it wasn't here? Yeah. Why? - I found it! - God dammit! - Do you have food in there? Yeah. Everything's gone. This is impossible. It was my grandfather's. He had it during the war. He's buried with this. - He surprised you. - No. No. I took this piece and I placed it in his coffin myself. This can't be here right now, this is with him! Things, they appear here all the time. Did you think I wandered into the forest with a truckload full of supplies? All those books in the trailer, and the trailer itself. My family, we used to... we used to have an identical one. And you've seen me, I don't know I don't know what I'm doing out here. I... I... I don't even know how to tie a snare, right? Right? A triple cheeseburger. And the girl? It's my daughter. It's all memories. She loved stories and rabbits and she was always... fascinated by fire. Everything burning last night. She burns me. I'm sorry. Let's go. Hang on. I need... I need to rest a minute. How much longer until the road? I guess in about five more hours. First, we pass the river then after that, it's just a little ways. You're going to be home by tomorrow. What are you doing? Don't move. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. Sweetheart, sweetheart? Just stay where you are, okay? Emily, put the gun down. Just listen... put the fucking gun down! - It's not her. She's not real. But she is real. This time, she is real. Peanut? Just stay where you are, okay? My grandfather called me peanut. Peanut just stay where you are, okay? NO!! Why did you take her from me, again, huh? Why did you fucking take her from me again? Huh?? Ah! Ah! Here's your compass. Head east and you'll be home tomorrow. You fucking idiot! So, you're going to be here tomorrow, right? Thanks, Peanut. I thought you everything. You were like a daughter to me. I was all alone! Grandpa? - Hey! - Hey. - How are you feeling? - Okay. Relieved. I can see that. We'll get you back to town, stop off at the county hospital and make sure you're okay. At some point, we'll need a written statement from you. My partner, he said something about a little girl? Yeah. I told him everything that happened. Okay. We'll stick around for a while to see what we can find, in the meantime, you get some rest, right? Hey? Hey? Hey! - Yeah? - Hey, wake up! - What? - Wake up! I'm awake! I'm awake! What are you... I'm awake! - Wake up! - I'm awake! I'm awake! What are you doing? What are you... I'm awake! I'm awake! What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Wait! Wake up! Wake up! You need to wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! I found my place, I got lost. - It's okay. - I got lost. It's okay. It's okay. I've been doing this wrong the whole time. It worked though. I don't think it did. I think the forest just let me have it, you know? Food, water, fire, it was all just... Given to me. Do you think it will let us leave? Never worked for me, but... Maybe better luck for you. I don't know how much I have left in me. Let's find out. It's like walking through glue. Come on, peanut. - You can do this. - I got it, I got it. I'm just going to put you down. Stay here for a minute, okay? I've got to figure all this out. - Just stay here. - No, no, no. - I'll figure this out. - No, I made a mistake. Don't go. Don't go. I'm so sorry. Daddie's right here, okay? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's happening again. You know, the whole thing, the whole thing is happening again. Do you see that? It's happening again. No. No! Moses Rafferty Memoirs, 1971. The sun started to come up. I lay there starring at Goldfarb's ugly dead face staring back at me. My heart was pounding kind of burst out of my chest. You know, you make decisions as you go along. Sometimes, they come back to haunt you. I should have said something. I knew we were in the wrong place. Tom... Goldfarb and the rest of the guys... Lost like that. It doesn't... It just doesn't... heal ever. Sorry, Peanut.
