This is the story of a contract workers wife Images of a fairly large class that is now lost. The last of those contract workers traveled on Swedish highways in 1945. The contract workers were farm workers with few rights. They were lodged in wooden houses of poor quality. They slaved away, day and night. The man out on the fields... And the wife milking cows with "the white whip". They were never themselves, nor free. They were "trapped by destiny". No one were allowed to be different. ONLY A MOTHER - Oh, lord. - Yes, it sure is hot today. Hey, listen up! What's going on? You won't believe it! Get over here. Hurry up! It's something terrible. Go get some hot water. - Rya-Rya has been bathing in public. - Has she no shame? In the middle of the lake! It was beautiful. So beautiful. Quite a sight. Nothing like you old hags. Heed my whispers. Her fianc? is sure to avoid her after this. I saw... Did you now? What did you see, old fribble? Am I not allowed to speak? So talk, God damn it. Don't you have the decency to wash yourself in private? I'm positive that Nils will leave her. How much we've played here in the Hot Hills. Here I was destined to meet you. "We will live here, you and me." Do you remember your words? You'd go fishing on Sunday and bring home a big pike. One mustn't be gluttonous. Just imagine to get away from here. From all old hags and children. All their gossip and talks. Darn mosquitoes. Nils, what is it? No one is like Jesus He's always by my side He can heal your every wound No more tears you have to bear No one quite like Jesus No one quite like him No one quite like him He answers all my prayers Yes he cares for my prayers No one quite like Jesus Put some of this down the girls collars, lads. Nonsense, we don't believe in such. - It's horse dander, very reliable. - Nils! - Oh, it's the swimmer. Nils! I have no quarrel with you. No woman can resist this horse dander. I can't continue. - Can I come with you, Rya-Rya? - Only if you like my kind. Nils. - No, you can't. I?m untouched. - Oh, I wonder... So try me on then. Put it all in the middle and push it down. Rya, get up here and help. We should get out of here soon. I've been thinking. It was wrong. I only like you anyway. The incident scared me. They say you did it to show yourself to the contractors. Could we try to start over again? Rya, are you coming or what? I don't care about Henrik. And you shouldn't care about Berta. I did it only out of stupidity. - It's too late now. I'm pregnant. We're buying the rings in eight days. -Are you coming?! You've never been to the city, have you? Are there fish in the river? - Yes, occasionally. Rya, are you daydreaming again? It should read "Henrik" inside. And today?s date. It should be good quality. Or we'll take our business elsewhere. Surely it comes with a box? - It will be one of these. This one... I've seen better ones. Does it bother you? "It". - Yes, I'm being careful in the stairs. It's not so noticeable. Maybe the eyes. But not on the waist. I hope Henrik will be good to you. - A child needs his father. What are you yacking about? - None of your business, mister. Farewell then, and thank you for the inspection. Just stay quiet about it. Good day, dear Henrik. How are you? I must speak to you. As a married man I refuse to live up there, in the barracks. Then you ought to move into the castle. Mark my words, inspector. I might leave this place for another farm. Either you give me the black barrack or nothing at all. It's been promised to the Alms. They've been with us for four years, just for this. Alm's wife is sick. And the daughter. - Why do we need sick people up here? Well, nothing to be done about it. I didn't promptly say no. - For me it's already decided. Okay, I give you my word. - Well, then. Did it go well at the priest? - Quite so. But it was so ceremonial. The meat is a disaster. It's not done. - Not at all. Oh, what a misfortune. - The meat is delicious. It appears you have one of our plates. Let us change. I'll have a toast for the bride and groom. Now is the time. Yes a toast for the bride and groom. I'm grateful that we were blessed with a good daughter. They call you Rya-Rya. But you were born a Maria. You called yourself Rya-Rya. Even before you learned how to speak. It is a woman?s destiny to be married when she finds such good fortune. That both will be healthy. And that things will go their way. Don't be silly. You're disturbing me. Little dear, are you free on Saturday? We shall be lucky that you choose to continue, when we will move on. We're leaving this old place, known as "Backward". We old timers are worried. If they refuse to give us more, we'll just settle for less. You young folks. You begin. Cheers. Have some port, woman! It's a party, god damn it. Cheers! My arm hurts badly. I can't even raise my glass. The meat is a disaster. Should I tell a wedding tale? - No! Would you be quiet, please. Cecilia, mother Alm has fallen ill. In my heavenly home with my Father I will rest the eternal rest Among the divine, loving crowds I shall take my rest from Earth In my heavenly home, In my heavenly home In my heavenly home with my Father I will dress in a white shroud To heavenly tones of... quiet! It's mother Alm... Dear child, what is it? In my heavenly, heavenly home They deserve a cheer! Hurray, hurray, hurray! Get to bed already. - Get out, the lot of you! They put some firewood here. Let's get it out quietly. Be quiet! Henrik! You better hurry back home. It's time now! They're at it in the black barrack. What's going on? She's going into labor. You need to leave immediately if you want to make it to the midwife. I see now. - I think it's time. I'll see if I can find a horse. You'll miss the supper. - It's all the same to me. How does it feel? - Try to hurry up. I do need to change, don't I? - Yes. Your pants are behind the door. Don't touch the sink! - Off you go! How is he, little Otto? Don't let the man near you for a month. It'll just result in another child. If Henrik leaves me alone. After all, I'm married. Just throw him off you! Can I hold him? - No. Go fetch some firewood. Don't breathe on him! What are you doing? You have consumption! Please step aside when you see me here. I've been asked to get firewood. Why, you're married with children now. It's true I have a child, but about a wife... Stop being silly. Step aside and let me get the firewood. One gets lonely. Don't you agree? - Perhaps. Don't you understand how I feel? - No, Henrik! Let go of me! I was not going to talk about it. But Henrik is chasing after us girls. Is it you? - Not so much. If he has business with you it's all the same to me. I mean... then I don't have to. I have this little man here. Farewell, then. I'm marrying Nils. Has your time come? - I don't have to be pregnant first, do I? We're getting married anyway. I just thought I'd let you know. Nils - need to talk to you. I'll be waiting at the window at 3pm. Strange. I was just wondering how the woman of this kitchen looked like. It was windy. You must've missed me. You think we don't know... what goes on behind locked doors? Oh, but we do. Everything new. Knives... scissors. It's beautiful here. And so are you. And yet, I should've known earlier. Stop talk nonsense. I don't have the time. Don't let me disturb. - What do you want? Perhaps you need something sharpened? I guess not. New knives needn't be sharpened. It's all the same, by the way. Where are you from? - From outside. Perhaps I'll return another time, then. Well, then. Henrik! Henrik! Eleven crowns. Why do I need it? I won't force it on you. Hold on a second. I can't go on like this. But I'm stuck here until the inspector finds someone else. Maybe you'd like to do the milking for me? Just for a while? I'm tired. Henrik won't allow me. Milking is the white whip for us, wives of contractors. Which is the truth. There will always be the privileged ones. Who simply don't have to do the milking. Despite my aches I will continue, although it seems impossible. But one day, I shall hang myself on on top of the hill. Above the cows. They shall see me, an old milker, hang there and suffer. My neck will be long, as will my arms. I've already tended to the snare and crossbar. And my neck... they will see it right here. I'm worried that I'm that way again. Did you let the old man touch you again? Are you out here, even though you're married? Why don't you get married yourself? - I'm marrying the one you couldn't get! Are you going home? - It's too early. What on earth...! God help me. I have acted so bad. Why didn't you come when I wrote you? Stay here. I will drive you home. You have to see to the milking. - I have two children to care for. That is none of my concern. The work has to be done! Don't look at me like that. Is it the new maid? - Her name is Margaretha. Perhaps there is an alternative. Erika Rost who lived here before. She used to help me with the choirs. An in return she didn't have to tend the milking. Don't you think she was pleased? - Ask her. She's standing right there. Good day, dear inspector. What is she doing here? - That's not very polite, is it? Don't one have the right to revisit one's old house and reminisce? Is it like you left it? - Quite so. Stove's there. As is the roof. Even the inspector is the same. What's going on? He has commanded me to do the milking. - That's not going to happens. My wife will not milk any cows! Either you do the job I tell you to do, or you simply have to move from here. Don't mind if we do, kind inspector. When is the eviction? All the same my wife won't milk any cows. I'll tell you all about the eviction. - Please do. Perhaps everything is not like you left it here, in the barrack. I say, what a man you got yourself! Of course you should do the cleaning. Besides, you deserve some fun as well. Don't go and have a bunch of kids. - What else is there to do? I was never pregnant. Don't we women deserve to have some secret? On Midsummer I'm going to get pictures with the kids. Henrik will be pleased. That's about all secrets that I have. - One visit. 2,50 crowns. - That'll do. But I'm first in line. I arrived here first. Just let me finish this... - As long as I come first. Look at the little birdie. - Please be quiet for a moment. Don't forget the little birdie. One, two and... I'll be back at Friday, 2pm. As agreed. - Very well, madame. I really was first in line... - Excellent. Grandiose. Well done. On such an occasion I rather be home. - One grows old. It's too much already. Dancing and jumping about doesn't do anything for me. Let's have another, while we can. Yes, it's quite strange with brandy. It keeps us warm during the winters. And somehow, cools us down during the summer. At wedding's it cheers us up. And on funerals it makes us... melancholic. Not too much. Or I'll leave on this very day! She's been at the photographer. - What are you talking about? She went and had her pictures taken. I drove her to the city and then back. Well I'll be damned...! Stop it! Stop it immediately! Can't you hear me? Stop it this instant! Or I'll leave. Go on dear. Did you leave yet? Where is your daddy, little children? Never tell us you had to starve, children. Anyone who says that is a liar! Take this and buy what you want, children. I've never been cheap. Did I? - No, never. If anyone should object we'll protest. What's wrong? Otto, what is it? Oh Lord! She swallowed something! She has something in her throat! She's dying! Quick, we need help! There are things to be done. My time has come to help. Do what needs to be done. Imprison me, if it's needed. Step inside and grab some food. Farewell then, dear Margaretha. We're only women left in this carriage. She was spared all of this. There were so much left to be done. Perhaps it was for the greater good. The years passed by with no regard. The world war came. Even in these godforsaken part of the world people were growingly concerned. In the midst of the biggest shoveling of wood. Rya-Rya felt her heart trapped. She was waiting for winter to disband and release her hunger for love. Am I disturbing in these stressful times? I'm trying to get the house in order for Christmas. It's quite impossible to get anyone to milk the cows. There's simply no time. Many men arrived to our society. If we want, we can sell a lot of milk. I'm serious this time. - But I have twice as many children now! I did offer you a choice, didn't I. Here you are making things pretty. The bachelors don't live this nice. I'm not satisfied with Emili. She's old, and... I'll let her go. Well, to each his own. If it is the inspectors will, and it doesn't hurt me, I will clean. I will of course have to talk to Emili first. I know what you're thinking. And I, too, have to speak to Henrik. You men are nothing but a pair of pants! A person of your kind needs to have a soft spine. It smells of cigars. Who was here? - I didn't see no one. Quite some sight! Don't you recognize me? I told you I would be back. I have the goods. - Who are you? Hammar! - Yes? I just intended to keep my promise. Take this requisition. Let's head over to the saw mill. Don't touch me! I'm sure that's what people believe. - Does that make me guilty? I don't want to go back home yet. Women should decorate for Christmas. It's good with a capable wife. Are you on about the milking again? I won't interfere! It's been decided long ago. Emili will tend to it. Not anyone is able to clean at the inspectors' house. Your wife is out and about. It's true. - Lies. Lies and slander. I shall call on Emili. She will know. What is this? What do you want? What?! Return back home. Just go! I'll be damned! And God, in the nightly hour. Rests pure... where have you been? I couldn't tell you. I took the cleaning. I get just as much as for the milking. Didn't want to tell, eh? One day I was bound to go looking for someone else. Isn't that what you said? Look?! For the inspector? Get out of here! When I grow up I will buy a motorcycle. I'll be my mothers' driver. - You look frightened. - Do I? Yes, perhaps. I hope I am not to blame? - I wouldn't think so. It's just, that... what? Tell me. - Nothing. One shouldn't have to be frightened just because one is a woman? Maybe we'll meet again, like this? - Yes, perhaps. It's so lonely around here. You shouldn't stay up so long. In my situation I don't feel like working or sleeping. Your situation? Is it worse than mine? - Everyone is talking about me. I'm all alone among these women. They all look the same to me. What about the gossip? Is it not true? I give birth to your children. I haven't changed. Can't you see? Oh God, she hasn't lost her mind, has she? Nonsense. She can do what she wants. As long as she keeps safe. Am I supposed to be frightened again? - Aren't you women frightened? Can't we go and talk somewhere? We were supposed to. I was just going to pick up an axe down at the saw mill. I don't understand why I'm running around like this. This is the saw mill. Don't get cold. - I won't. We could make a bonfire. - People would notice. Why are we standing here? I barely even know your name. When do we even know ourselves who we really are? Haven't you heard anything about me? - No. No one said anything. Tell me. What could I possibly tell about myself? I used to be a lonely child. I never knew my own mother. Who she was. Whenever I would meet a strange woman, I wondered if she looked like my mother. I never cared for them. Yet still I married. I tried to make sense of it all. Mostly for the sake of the child. But I couldn't take it. I had to leave. And so I left. Once I saw a woman. A woman I came to look very close to. She had something. Something I had been looking for. Isn't it strange you think? I could see it immediately. And I thought it'd be nice to have her by my side. I've been thinking. That one day, she and I will walk away from here. Away from it all. Out somewhere, far away. It's getting cold. - Wait! Don't fear me. It's supposed to be here somewhere. Now I know who you are. My biggest boy. I don't care for nothing else. Be kind to me. Don't you see? I want to hear about the good old days here. It would be like a history in culture. About what once was here. Do you mean stories of women and such? - No, not quite. That being said I wouldn't mind some of that, too. Most fuss came from our superiors before. Now... just look at the contract workers wife who is messing around with other men. Is she? - Indeed. He is quite oblivious. They won't leave him be. Many are out and about. Last night... Oh, Johanna! Can you hear me? I almost felt myself the godfather of the little one. But I remember that she once ran into the lake. Completely naked. Swimming,. A person has four stages, in this life. There our youth, and a time for mature. But also the time of being wild. And then there is the aging. What is for sure is that she'll have a rough time if her husband finds out. The inspector doesn't know Henrik. He's a lion, even though he doesn't look one. I've warned you. Henrik is a dangerous guy. You are an eternal, blessed, coward of a man! You poor weakling. You don't even deserve to walk in pants. A skirt is what you should wear. You've allowed for your wife to walk about. Now she has an affair with that yob. It isn't true! You really accept everything. Even if one would pee you right in the face. If you don't pay a visit to the inspector so help me God, I will. I will show you what I can do. You've been too weak. You hit a woman the first time she commits adultery. Not the last. After that she needs to really have it. Women are struck by something unspeakable in this age. Come sit down. I'll tell you what I know... What are you doing? My eyes have been closed. People think that "cleaning" means something else. Don't touch me! - Oh, the unfaithful is proud? I'm not unfaithful to just anyone, just the one I like! Yes or no? For the last time tell me. - No! By tomorrow I'll have myself that milker. The time of choice is over. You stay! Did you want something? - I'm resigning. That's very good. Third time's a charm! Is that so? - I force no one to stay here. I've acquired a new worker. His name is Hammar. Hammar? - Yes. Does that name sound familiar? Where will be stay? - In "Backwards", naturally. The wild forest life is over. Maybe there's a reason why he wants to stay? I stand by my word. I will never return. I want to bring you with me. Now that I know who you are. One day we will leave, you and me. When we cannot stand it any longer. Out somewhere, far away. And we shall never return. Never return. They'll be back with us in a few years. - A few years? One year, two years... Where will we be? In which apartment? - In Alm's old attic. Elis, come here! - Many others have stayed there. At the Alm's? Don't drop it! That's two chairs. Give him a hand. Let mother take the clock. Rya, will you take it please? Are you taking the mattress? Bring it on then. Children, help her. Help you old man. - Don't throw the chairs! My God, are you here again? - Good day. Everything goes around, you see. Are the people here? - Yes. I am. Then I shall leave. I have been expecting you. I was going to quit so many times. But this place is no different. People return. No one needs to wait for me. That's not why I came back. I don't want us to see each other anymore. I'm done for. Leave. Leave, before someone comes. Leave! Why would I leave when I've been waiting for so many years? Don't! You went back to him. That's why you wanted to return. He says something happened in the basement. Is it true? Every word of it. I'm left alone like a leper, while you sleep around with others. Leave me be. Why do I care for him? Or you? I only care for one thing in this life. You'll never understand. Oh Lord, bless us and deliver us from evil. Lord, your gracious face. The children are supposed to be enlisted at school. Why didn't you come on time? Or on a break? Let me see those grades. Children of contract workers... I see. Untie your shirt. Untie the upper buttons. You are clean I hope? I've always tried to keep them clean. Sit down. - Contractor kids! The children may stay. They needn't miss more days of school. That boy is called Nils. He's from the Black Barracks. Is your name Nils? From the Black Barracks? Oh Lord, is that you? - I came to say hello. Good day. - Hello. It's been a long time. - I guess so. Henrik was assigned to the barn. And I have to tend to the milking. And now you live here. That's right. The cabin is not anything special. I wasn't planning on taking it from you. - And neither could you. Thank you. I won't be coming along often, if that's what you thought. Could you possibly do the milking for me tomorrow? I'd awfully much like to have the day off. I wanted to bring the family out to the Hot Hills. If the weather allows for it, of course. Help me, Emil. - No, wait. I'll help. You're older than me. - And let's go! Yes! I will do the milking for you tomorrow as I know you will appreciate. Where are you off to? - Nykoping. For business. I took the day off tomorrow. I thought we'd go out. To the Hot Hills. I could bake a cake, and we could stay as long as we'd like. So it's decided. - I'd like that. Could we have a drink as well? - I didn't think about that. Then I won't be joining. Just kidding! So it's been decided. Yes. Of course it's decided. If only Elis was here we could already get going. It's Elis. And he has a motorcycle. You'll see. Just listen to how it sounds. Let's go! Surely the family should be first to see. - Could we have a ride? I'm not afraid. You can bring me on it. Shouldn't we be leaving? - We have time for some coffee. It's not every day you see one of those things out on the lawn. Perhaps you'd also like to stay, Anna? It's good here in the Hot Hills. - It sure is. I see you went fishing last Sunday. Just enough for the cat. Are you here all by yourself? - I'm never alone. I have my children. They're out on a ride now. Elis got himself a motorcycle. That's all good. I know where they'll be. Who was queen Kristina? - She was a Swedish queen. She was one of the queens of Sweden. Queen Kristina was born... when did she die? - Queen Kristina died... She lived an unmarried life. - That was not my question. Oskar! Queen Kristina lived an unmarried life. - Is that all you know? When did she die? Does no one know the answer? Who was queen Kristina's mother? I think... - You think? Anna! - Her name was Maria Eleonora. - Correct. Well done. When did queen Kristina die? - She died 1689. That is correct. Now for some math. How much is 67+125? You? How about you? Well? Let's have Stig solve it. - 67 plus 125 equals 192. How about 7x97? - That will be 679. - Attaboy. That was difficult. - This young lad knows his numbers. Can you also tell me what 75 divided in 375 is? Five. - Well done, son. You can count. He's real good at counting, the boy. I wonder who he will grow up to be. Could it be something wrong with him? Perhaps he could start to work for me. What do you think, Stig? - Well, for the time being yes. That's right. You could try and then continue. Are you laying here all by yourself? What's the matter? Have you been crying? It aches. I cannot get any sleep. Don't be mad. But something's not right. Perhaps I'm destined to pass away from you and the children. I didn't want to tell you. But now I can't hold it any longer. What are you saying. If you're unwell I'll come with you to the hospital. I will ask for a leave and come with you. I don't want to leave. I want to stay with you, here at home. I'm sure it will be fine. It's time to milk the cows. If you feel bad there's no need to go. - Of course I'll go. What's the matter? - Get over here and help out. Rya, what's the matter? Good day, mother. I just heard the motorcycle. Imagine, that you arrived at the same time. We got a ride. So much time you're spilling on me. - Don't you worry about it. It's good that you brought the gloves with you. They could've been stolen. Let them lay here on the bed cover. Shouldn't you have one of those caps? With big glasses. When you are speeding with the motorcycle. I will purchase those later. It's against the wind you see. Yes. When you drive so fast you're bound to have sand and dirt in your eyes. One thing at a time. I still owe money for the machine. I'm just worried about sand in your eyes. You do should wear a hat. I should speak to the rest of you as well. Otto... I have something to say. Something I wanted to tell you. Nothing's wrong I hope? - What have you done? I might have to get married by autumn. You didn't cause anyone any harm, did you? Well, did you? - That's my own business. It's Dorotea. It happened like this because we both stayed in Backwards. It's good that I heard about this. You do a good job at the gross store, right Stig? You don't make any mistakes counting the money. Right? All items are marked with special letters. Only we know what they correspond to. It's like a cipher. It's created from the store owners name. But you do count correct, don't you? The owner usually comes to me when he needs something to be calculated quick. I brought a strawberry straw. It's from the Hot Hills. Anna... You'll have to look after them. Do the right thing until you grow up. Please leave us, children. I need to talk to your father. I can feel the ache begin again. I'm never mistaken in this. Couldn't we talk a bit first? Surely we have to stay positive? - That's not what I wanted to talk about. I want to know what will become of you and the children. Otto is getting married. You'll have to see to it that everything goes well. Give them something from... you. Give them our old crib. Otto is the only one who would settle for it. He's most like the rest of us. I think Elsa is also seeing someone. Try to keep Anna with you when Stig is at the gross dealer. She could learn how to milk the cows. She's a good girl. I'm sure it can be arranged. Once the time comes. And then we need to talk about us. What about us? - You've spent so much on me already... No need to talk about that now. You've been a good husband. And I've been an unfaithful wife. Would you finally be able to forgive me for that? You've been good as well... Maria. Subtitled prepared for KG by voice (c) 2020
