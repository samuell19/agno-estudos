I can drive, believe me! This wreck has no brakes, the boom's down, the train comes, we head for a mound! Yes, a mound. What choice when the train is bearing down on us? -My nerves are shot! -You talk of nerves? What about me? -We have a sold-out theater waiting on us. -It always is! What if we don't get there? How nice. I, Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt, having played on all the grand stages of this country, have to travel around with this company who'd win first prize in a country fair. Don't just stand there, look to see if the motor's broken! -Broken? Better to look if there is one. -Then do it! ...I'd perform even if it was on crutches. I feel better now. -How are you, Nanna? -I'm fine. You better leave, you're not as hardened as us. And you, boys. What are you staring at? Help out, instead! I'll sit down now and won't move an inch until the bus is repaired. I believe you. Here are the tools. What would you like, this? Whatever, beside the whisk for the last act! -Screwdriver? -Don't mutter, I'm already sore! -Here... -What, does it work with springs? Get lost, little man, before another accident occurs! Yeah, yeah. Save your energy... Get lost and leave me alone with my bus! Helge, don't forget the suitcases. Nanna, hey...! I've got a room with two lovely beds and a sofa! -Thanks dear, we're coming. -Bag the sofa, I'd rather sleep alone. Really? Here it is. Good day. -Good day. -Look...! -What do you think of this? -It's absolutely wonderful. -Welcome to you all. -Thank you very much. This is really nice, we'll get on well here. There are no shades. How will we undress? I'm sure you're decent under that. Alright then... Come in. -That's nice of you. -No problem. -Put them down there. -Could I have my suitcase? -Thanks. -Very nice of you, thank you. You can sleep for a few hours and I'll wake you when the bus is ready. Don't go and party now. Hardly... -Shades, right? -How about that one! Nanna, I guess I'll take the sofa so there won't be arguments. -Don't meddle in things you don't grasp. -But I can... -You take the bed. -What's the pecking order here? You may well ask. But when you bag, you bag... So, go ahead. There's the sofa. Nanna, again? -Just let her drink. -Thank you. You sweet little rattlesnake. Cheers! -Goodness, Malte! -What is it? I forgot I telegraphed him at JĂ¤rnviken. -He's meeting us at eight in the morning. -Malte? Who is Malte? You don't imagine he'll be there at eight in the morning? You can be certain of it, my dear Karin. If I have a friend, I have a friend. Not like some of us. A cousin in every town. -Flits. -What? Yes, like a butterfly from flower to flower. It sounds like a fairytale, but it's really true. Malte and I haven't seen one another in twenty-five years. Then he was just a Mr. Nobody and we were madly in love with one another. But he was the son of the steelworks owner, you see, and wealthy. And I wanted to make a career on my own. It didn't work out. -So he married another. -Yes, he did. It was my way of making him happy. Now he's the boss there. And you're on the edge of the sofa and don't know better. Yes, I know you mean well. -But don't play my bad conscience. -But Nanna... You know so much... If you've let the devil on the boat, you better row him ashore. And Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt knows very well what she's bailing... -...to keep herself afloat. -It's your little way of making a career. A lot has happened since then, believe me. I'll never forget when I met Malte for the first time. He stood outside the stage door carrying an armful of beautiful, red roses. Malte! Malte Brundin, Jr. Welcome. It's lovely of your father to send you here. Unfortunately father is away, so he asked me to come and welcome Miss HĂ¶gfeldt. What enchanting flowers. Thank you. My pleasure. Is there anything I can do for you? Would you invite all of them to breakfast? You see, I've spoken so much of Malte... Your father, I mean. So they almost expect it of me. Of course, it's already done. Why don't you come along! What are you waiting for? Come here. May I present theater director Rydman. Mr. Brundin. -Pleasure. -The pleasure is mine. Miss Lund. What a wonderful car you have. Mr. Brundin, this is Monika Hall. -It'd be nice to show you the steelworks. -Good evening! But before that, perhaps you'd like some breakfast at the hotel? -Thank you. -I gather you're tired and hungry. Allow me. Mr. Johanson. Johanson with one "s". I was just saying to my friend that we've come to a lovely place. You feel happy being here. That's nice to hear. You're from Gothenburg I hear? Yes, Gothenburg! Actually from MĂ¶lndal next door. -Mr. Ă–lander. -This is Mr. Ă–lander, a lovely boy. So, where exactly is the hotel? Mr. Johanson is so interested, he'd prefer going straight to the steelworks. What do you say, my boy? It's magnificent, right? -Colossal... -Yeah. After such a good breakfast all this running about is unnecessary. But if we can make him happy with so little, I expect we should listen to what he says. It may be useful. ...little by little and after about three hours the iron is ready to be poured. Here the iron is put into molds, cools and becomes pig iron. And Malte came up with all of this? -Yes, and grandfather. -Seeing all this makes you feel so small. -I didn't even know this existed. -I believe you. This is so interesting. There's only one thing I don't understand. How do you make the iron? Well, what is the time? -But where's Monika? -Monika? You can't do this, Miss. You can't just walk around here. It didn't look too dangerous. I was more afraid when you came. -Who has let you walk around here? -Your boss. -My apologies. -You're welcome. -I must have gone astray from the others. -The actors? -They're over there. -They are? Thank you. Goodbye. -Miss! I've dirtied your jacket. -No... -You have my whole hand on your back. -Where? No, look at that... -If you follow me I'll try and remove it. -Thank you, that's very kind. -This way. -Thanks. But we were expecting a shipment from Bufors today. Yes... Yes. Just let it wait until I get there. I'm through here. Ferdinand, could I borrow your stain water? She has a stain on her jacket. He's an inventor. He has his little patents. -Here you go, if it will do any good. -Could you please come with? -Have I caused you a lot of trouble? -On the contrary. It's funny that this is the first time I've met an actress. -Really? -I didn't think it would be like this. -Shall I take off my jacket? -No, it's fine as it is. I mean, if you allow me to rub you in this way. Rub away. The main thing is to get the stain out. That's the point. -Were you going to the theater tonight? -No. -But I changed my mind. No, stand still. -Sorry. Then perhaps I can arrange a couple of tickets for you? Thank you. -What's your name? -Erik Norrby. -The guys... -Yes. -Is it done? -It's wet, but the stain is gone. Ferdinand's water removes everything. Stains as well. We'll meet this evening, then. Thank you. -You're welcome. -So long. -So long. -Goodbye. Pretty, right? -We're going to the theater tonight. -Really? So, you decide? Yes, this time. She's playing the lead role. You can go, but I don't care for such things. Karin Lund. That's her. I'm to pick up two tickets for Norrby, Erik Norrby. No, there aren't any. Who was leaving them? I don't know... Miss Lund, Karin Lund. No, there aren't any. -Get moving there. -Yes. -Unreliable like all theater people. -There must be a mistake. -We'll go in anyway. -No. -I'll buy the tickets. -Is it worth spending money on this? Excuse me, there should be two tickets for Mr. Norrby in my name. -Good day. -Look, there you are! Good day. -I just fixed the tickets for you. -Thank you. -Welcome! -Thanks. Yes, time is relative. It only took me five minutes with the new edition of Malte. How nice for you. Then you have food for tonight. He's just a cockerel, but still. If I know you, my dear Karin, you'll still manage to pluck him well. Gosh, all this fussing with your guys. I won five kronor playing poker. Yes, crumbs are also bread. Just wait until you become a "star" like Karin. -You'll also go out with the big boys. -Keep your trap shut. What did you say? You'd best be polite, let me tell you. -Shall I say hello to father-in-law? -You watch out! I guess I should. I may have you as mother-in-law. -That would suit you. -Oh, no. -He looked really nice with clothes on. -Who? Don't be excessive, my dear Karin, one at a time. Get moving, the bell has gone. Aren't you ready yet? No, you wouldn't say so. I have to play a tender and loving mother to Karin. And with nothing drinkable to cover my real feelings with. Yes, that was the drop that caused the cup to overflow... Enter the stage, you who dare. No response will be correctly said. You're welcome. She's Karin Lund. -Mom, did you see them take him away? -Why wouldn't I have? I've been by the window the whole time. Now you should ask me if he'll keep quiet. Dummy... -Do you think he'll keep quiet? -How would I know? -He's no gentleman if he doesn't. -That would be frightful. It's much more frightful than you think. Now of course you'll say that they put him in handcuffs. -Mom, they put him in handcuffs. -What did I say? What else do they do with a prisoner, tell me that? -Damn, she's off again. -And she's on form. Monika, there's a flask in my room. Pour a little glass and get straight on stage. -Go quickly! -A little glass? In the mood she's in today, she takes about two quarts an hour. You'll have to sort that out yourselves, I won't get involved. Good day, good day. Well, it's like this... What is it? Spit it out, don't just stand there nodding! Good, we agree. It's like this: Inspector York from Scotland Yard would like a word with Lady "Whoops." -Ask him to come in. -Right away. Come in. So, the police would like to speak to me? That's wrong, I'd like to speak to you. I'd like to ask what you're up to? Are you dropping your hat? -Happened to do so. -Can't hold it? -By all means. -Don't argue, my house is upside down. It's full of police and as usual you've nabbed the wrong person. In your house, Your Ladyship, a man has been hiding for eight days. A man the police have been looking for, for over two years! She's at the end. Ah, that's exactly what I needed. Thank you. Thank you, my dear Maud. You may go. I won't need you this evening. Go out and enjoy yourself. Right. Now I'm ready. The smallest child can talk to me. -Well, have they come out yet? -No. -What are you doing with those? -She's the only one without flowers. -Is that really necessary? -Yes. You see? For me it was fine that she played the maid. Why? Look, Monika, what did I tell you? Thank you, that's very kind. -She was worried she wouldn't get flowers. -Thank you. Nanna, this is Mr Norrby who I mentioned and his good friend. -I'd understood that. They're charming. -They're wonderful. Hello. Where have I seen you before? I never forget a face, although I never remember whose it is. I had this face twenty five years ago as well. No, it can't be? -Ferdinand Sund? -Yes. It was you that brought letters to me from Malte. -From Mr. Brundin. -From Brundin, yes. -We have a lot to talk about, then. -Yes. It's a pity I'm so tired this evening. -What about tomorrow? -I'm not sure, but... It's the only day, we leave on Monday. Imagine, I can't understand it, but I don't remember that Mr. Sund looked so nice. If you ladies feel like it, you could come to my cottage tomorrow. You could get some fresh air and rest for a while. -Thank you, with pleasure! -That would be lovely. Of course. So pretty! It's as pretty inside as outside. But it's a little dark. Couldn't we open a shade? Oh, yes. My gosh! Does it... -...go up on its own? -Yes, watch out now. No, you know what? If I had something soft to fall on, I'd faint on the spot. Then go ahead! Really! Are you trying to frighten me to death? It's not so bad. It's magic. So ingenious! That's it. Come here and I'll show you another little amusement. Just look! A little fan! -That can't give much fresh air. -Fan? It's not a fan. -It's a clock. -Is it a clock? Of course! -It's beautiful. -Yes, I made it myself. We amused ourselves with such things a few years ago, Erik and I. What he has in his head, I have in my hands. But now we have more serious things at hand. Well, if it goes as I've imagined I'll build out the cottage, both in length and breadth. -And in height as well if needed! -How nice. -Ferdinand? -Yes. Could I make a little observation? -What? -Come here. I wanted to say that your porch out there, or whatever it is... -It's a bit miserable. -It is? -What's wrong with it? -There should be a porch on this side. Along the whole wall with a view of the little lake. -Really? -And thick with geraniums. What? Geraniums? No thanks! I don't want any geraniums. -I can't stand geraniums. -Geraniums are beautiful. -I don't like them! -Oh, I do. I can't help that, but I don't want any geraniums anyway. That's a pity. Because I think they're beautiful. Was it you? Was it you that applauded when I entered the stage yesterday? I'd waited so long, I was happy to see you. It was very nice of you. I guess you were a bit disappointed. -Quite the opposite. -Quite the opposite? For me it was good you didn't have the lead as I'd thought. You wouldn't have put up with such simple fare. The leading lady ran off in a fancy car. -You mean Karin Lund? -Why did she play that role? -It would suit you much better. -It's not so easy in the theater. You have to have your years of drudgery behind you. But I'll get my chance as well, I hope. -It won't be long, I'm convinced. -You think highly of me. -Yes, I do. -Where's the fish we're having for lunch? -It's in Ferdinand's boat. -It is? -You're getting hungry, right? -It's all the water. I understand. Let's see... -Here! -Oh, look what a whopper! It's sweet seeing you pottering about. You're a real Jack-of-all-trades. -I may well be. -No, I feel really strange. -Why? -I must do the dishes. -Do the dishes? Not in this house. -Really? Oh, no. Look here. Like that. -What about the tablecloth? -It'll be cleaned with the dishes. Life is strange. When I for once want to sacrifice myself for a man, he doesn't need it! It's taken two years to put that expensive dishwasher together. What good is it? -Is this where we're going ashore? -Yes, this is my desert island. I'll build a cottage when I grow up. -Will you? -Yeah. Thanks. This is wonderful. I could actually stay here all summer. That's fine. Had I known, the cottage would be ready. -You should have thought of it. -I was occupied. -With what? -I work from morning to night. -And I study. -You study? I was thinking of doing an engineer exam. -Are you going to be an engineer? -You must count when throwing your lot in. -Yes. -Talking of which, can you throw skimmers? Skimmers? I think so. Let's try, come. Right. Like this... That wasn't so good. This will be better. -Good. -See? Try it. Here goes... -It wasn't meant... -Yes it was. No. -Are you angry with me now? -No. -What are you thinking of? -Nothing. Nothing? Yes, I am. How wonderful it is here. This business of grass in my face isn't so nice. -I can't do anything good today. -Have you tried? -In my way, but it wasn't right. -Can you just lie quietly here next to me? Hard, but I'll try. -Can I talk? -No. -Can I whistle? -No. -What can I do? -Nothing. Nothing... I think it's wonderful that you haven't brought out mechanics into the garden. This is the most wonderful day of my whole life. I don't want to drive you away or be disagreeable in any way. -But it's best that we be setting off. -What time is it? -Almost five. -Goodness, so late already! Time just runs away. It's just like when I was young. No, it's not! It's definitely not! I'll take that back. Where on earth have the youngsters gone? I wonder. I'll call them. Call them? That won't be easy. I remember when I was young walking with Malte. -Mr. Brundin? -I meant Mr. Brundin. We walked for five hours and he only talked steel. I didn't understand a thing. But I could have walked another five hours with him even if they'd called. Just wait till you hear how I call. Hold your hat! What was that? -Ferdinand wants us to come. -I don't want to. Me neither, but we have to. -When do you leave? -Early tomorrow morning. Why? Must you go straight home after the theater? Will you come and fetch me? Shall we sit here? Maybe the ground's a bit cold. -Look. -Thanks. Monika. -Don't go. You know I'm in love with you. -I have to. Don't you see what that means to me? I stay and you move on. You perform somewhere else every night in front of strangers. We didn't know each other two days ago. -I can't accept that it ends tomorrow. -You don't have to. It can't be. So far I've worked like a dog to get somewhere. Now I know why I have to get somewhere. Monika, I feel I could pull out trees for your sake. -If you had any use for them. -That's how I feel. We have a mad desire to become something, to get somewhere. Listen... We'll believe in each other and we'll help each other. And the next time we meet, it won't be in a meadow behind a steelworks. RYDMAN'S THEATER ROMEO AND JULIET Boxing Day -Don't you see the edge of the glass? -You'll get enough. I suppose... Ah, you made an effort there! -May I continue? -Don't let me disturb you. Thank you. I've said, it's been tradition in my company to raise a glass with company members every Christmas Eve. And even on this one, which is a peaceful holiday above all else, where all people are good to one another... ...and lies and mudslinging are banished. And with that said I now raise my glass and wish you all, from the bottom of my heart, a Merry Christmas. -Cheers to you all. -Cheers. And a heartfelt thank you, Sir, for those kind words. -Let me wish you a Merry Christmas! -Go ahead! Right, we just have to pay 1.50 for the sandwiches. -Merry Christmas! -Good evening, trim Christmas tree. -Is this the time to come? -I couldn't come before. I think that when I invite you on Christmas Eve you should be on time! Please Theodor, don't argue. -There was a card for you at the theater. -Cheers, Helge! -So, do I get anything then? -Sit down. -Cheers. Last Christmas we were in Arboga. -And we heard the same speech. -That's what I said. -Cheers. Nanna, my dear? -Cheers! -Really? Monika, go and put on the best clothes you have. I'm invited to a good friend and he wants me to bring along a nice girl. -Thank you, but I don't feel like it. -You don't? -Can't you be friendly on Christmas Eve? -No, it's not that. -I can't. -My dear... If you're only given visiting cards on a tray, you take the spoon when offered. Shame on you. Monika can enjoy herself and fill her belly without your friends. We know how you'll celebrate Christmas Eve. Nanna, that's enough of your cheek! It's only you trying to defame me, not so? Of course, Karin, if it's you... I mean... If Nanna says... Well, it's wrong. There you have it! I'd advise to stop your insolence. No ovations, Karin my dear. If it weren't Christmas, I'd tell the whole company how hospitable you can be after coffee and liqueur. Nanna, I really don't think you should make insinuations. -Why not? -Well, think about it. Christmas Eve. Monika, where are you going? -Merry Christmas. -Wait, I'll come with you. In a while. I just need a bit more warm glĂ¶gg. It's so cold in the room. No one wanted to hear more of that anyway. -Are you back so early? -I don't really feel well. -I think it's cold here. -I've had a fire going all afternoon. -It'll soon be warm, you'll see. -I hope it is. -The children singing doesn't disturb you? -Quite the opposite. It's Christmas Eve, after all. -Merry Christmas. -And to you. MERRY CHRISTMAS! -The telephone is ringing. -Thank you. Hello. Yes, it is. Hang on. It's for you. For me? Thank you. Hello? Is that Erik? Merry Christmas! Thank you for the card. Thanks. How nice of you to call. What's that? Exam? No... Congratulations! Aren't you happy? Happy you've come so far? For me? Things are going well. I got so many flowers yesterday evening. The whole room is full of flowers. The audience was wonderful. This evening? We're celebrating Christmas Eve, the whole company together. We'll celebrate a real Christmas with a tree, presents, lights and things. Yes. Yes... On New Year's Eve? We're performing as usual. Romeo and Juliet. Juliet is a wonderful role. I'd love to be able to perform it for you. What's that? Are you coming here? No, but... Yes, of course. I'm happy, but you see... You just surprised me. I'm performing, yes... Hello? The call is over. -Hello! -She was well, I heard. Oh, yes. I wanted to whole district to hear it. Things are going well for her. She's playing Juliet. Really? Juliet? -Well, cheers to your Juliet. -Yes. And cheers to your porch and your geraniums! What? -I'd like to speak to Miss Lund. -Please, the gentlemen can wait. I hardly think so. May I speak to Miss Lund? Yes, of course. One moment. Nanna, what is it? -How is your throat? -My throat? I'm certain you'll be hoarse on New Year's Eve. -Nanna, you've had one too many. -No, on the contrary. But I have a good idea. Does it matter to you that you don't play Juliet then? What do you mean? I don't understand. In a nutshell, Monika has told her boy that she's playing the lead role and he's coming here on New Year's Eve to see her perform. -I can't help it if she lies. -No, of course you can't. Gosh, it suits you. And it will be good to have when you get hoarse. -You mean I should...? -Yes, you've always wanted one. Do you really mean it? -Word of honor? -Word of honor. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath praised him so many thousand times? -Who is she? -Go, counsellor. -It's Monika Hall. -...henceforth shall be twain. I'll to the friar, to know his remedy: If all else fail, myself have power to die. You applaud any more and there'll be trouble. Come on. Just listen to them! She showed no stress. She was glorious. Such intuition, such absolute selflessness in the role! -Yes, she was good, but not so amazing. -What? Let me tell you, stepping into that role after Karin is no big deal. No big deal? She was Juliet! If she's like that the whole play, she'll be a sensation anywhere, I guarantee it. -Is she coming? She was... -Fantastic! Fantastic, yes! That's exactly what she was! Monika, I had no idea you could be so good! You know, when you said your last line to me, "Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!" I actually stood in the wings and felt ashamed! You were so good. And I was bad and got flowers. -You should have them. Yes, you should! -No... Monika, you were lovely, great to hear. In the next scene, when you come to Laurence's cell, don't just listen to him, you have to be almost hypnotized by what he says: "Wednesday is tomorrow: Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone; "Let not thy nurse lie with thee..." Then he says, "Take thou this vial, and this distilled liquor drink thou off; "When presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humor, "for no pulse shall keep his native progress, but surcease: "No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest..." Then you should feel as if the poison had already started to work in your body. And the audience have to feel how your pulse becomes slower and slower. They must imagine how you grow pale. Then when he speaks on... You die, you see. You die... "Thy eyes' windows fall, "Like death, when he shuts up the day of life; "Each part shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death". Goodness, Helge my dear. Is it you or Monika playing Juliet? Do you need to teach her, a dramatic pure-bred, how she should play and feel? Sorry, I meant well. Go and mean well elsewhere and not in the lady's dressing room. You should die in this scene. The man is right! Helge, come here. Come here. Where did you get this from? Go through it again, you can actually listen to him. I wonder if you don't have a director living in you. -Nanna, I've understood all along. -When you get to Laurence's, you must... Goodness, it's ringing! I'm so nervous, I'll think about what you said. Mr. Norrby, here you are. -Here you are, Miss Hall. -Thank you. What lovely flowers! That's so sweet of you, Erik. -They're not from me. -They're not? To the grand colleague from your insignificant Karin. It's been a long time since we met which makes it nicer seeing you again. -Did you like me? -What do you think? Perhaps I haven't come as far as you. -I'm thinking. -Of what? Of what we agreed upon at the meadow. Shall we continue with that? -What is it? -It's nothing. Who's it from? Show me. Isn't it fun to be so admired? Excuse me, dear Monika, for intruding. We have a little do up in the banquet hall. Of course, it would be deemed unsuccessful without our prima donna. -Perhaps you could...? -My apologies. Mr. Norrby, this is Miss Lund and Mr. Carlman. That dress looks very sweet on you. Erik, I can't very well... -Of course. -You're welcome to join us. -Come, let's go. -This way. Excuse me? Please see to it that those flowers are put into my room. -Yes. -Thank you. -Come on. -Karin... -Was that necessary? -What? I'm known in town and I think this is a bit awkward. -I asked your help. Do you want to or not? -Of course, Karin my dear. Well then. All you need to do is to make sure we get fed. Come on. It must be wonderful for you to see Monika perform. She was brilliant as Juliet. Juliet is a generous role, so it's not so strange. You should have seen her when she did her usual chambermaid. Her entry alone... She was just there. The audience didn't see anything else. Thanks, Karin, but aren't you exaggerating your kindness a bit? -That's the second time this evening. -Not at all. I'm merely giving Mr Norrby an idea of how much you have to love you to not find you dangerous as a colleague. Yes, there's no limit to your loving temperament. I think that your so-called humor sticks in some people's throats. -Who'll pay for this? -What do you mean? They're playing theater in there on their own time. Seeing the New Year in... -Where are you going? -You'd lose your appetite for less. Bye. I don't understand. What does all this mean, Monika? Don't worry about it, Erik. I feel a little tired. I'd like to go home. -Did you exhaust yourself so in the role? -Karin! -What Karin's been trying to say... -I haven't said anything. What she's been trying to say is I played the lead for the first time tonight. And everything I wrote to you and told you was a lie. I was ashamed because I hadn't gotten anywhere. That I've hurt you I can understand. But how I've injured Karin is beyond me. I just did what every actress would have done if she'd had the chance. I did my best. Farewell. -Monika! -No, stay here! I'd like to slap you! But I've given my hand to too many decent people to abuse it on you. It's a pity, Mr. Carlman, that you through Karin should receive such a low opinion of us actors. Excuse us. But thank you for the meal, nonetheless. And you. Call yourselves actors? You're not even bad actors! And companions. You don't even know what companions are! You're just... I don't have the words to say what you are! And as for that! -Has Monika left? -Yes, I have to find her. -But not tonight. -I must have an explanation. -What's behind all this? -Schemes as always. Monika is very proud and hurt. The past doesn't matter, she was superb this evening! -Yes, it was her first success. -Why be ashamed for me? For who else, for those in there? Oh, no. Monika isn't as hardened as we are. That's why she lied to you. Let her calm down, she'll get over this. I'm sure one fine day you'll laugh heartily at this New Year's Eve and this little deceit. Promise me not to look for her. Promise me. -Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. You're exactly the person I thought you would be. Oh, Monika... Don't be upset. Remember you once said to me that when you saw me on stage for the first time, everything changed for you. It was the same for me when I saw you as Juliet this evening. However nasty and jealous they've been this evening, those that call themselves our colleagues, and however much they tried to hurt you, they've done us a big favor anyway, even if they don't know it. We don't belong with them. We're off to Stockholm, you and I. I don't want anything for myself. But if I, Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt, arrive there and have you with me, all the doors will open for us. You'll see how easy it will be. An old and a new name. Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt conquers Stockholm with Monika Hall. ROYAL DRAMATIC THEATER ARTISTIC DIRECTOR The Artistic Director apologizes, but he can't see Miss HĂ¶gfeldt. Really? He can't see me? No... I've begged to see you four times without being received. -Excuse me. -Really? Have you forgotten that Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt performed in this theater for ten years? On the contrary, Miss HĂ¶gfeldt. You haven't been received exactly because I remember. Thankfully it's only happened once in this theater's history that an Elektra at a premier, with royalty in the auditorium, fell out of the stairs, because... Perhaps a reminder isn't necessary. And that's why doors are slammed in my face, still today? -I'm not here for my own sake. -Sadly it's the same thing, Miss HĂ¶gfeldt. There was a time when we spoke to one another as Harald and Nanna. Well, if you have anything personal to say to me, we can continue in that manner. It's not personal, so I won't humiliate myself again. I've been brushed off, time after time. I come here to put in a good word for my pupil, Monika Hall. Nanna, it should slowly dawn upon you that your name is not a recommendation here. Yes, I should have understood that. But that it's so grimly obvious I'm standing in her way, I only understand now. I still have confidence in you as an artist, but... I know. But what you or other people think of me is indifferent and my own opinion of myself is clear to me. But this girl believes in me. It grieves me. I am the Artistic Director, Nanna. I understand. You don't have to stare out of the window like that. It's Stockholm that I promised you as a New Year's gift. Don't speak like that. You've done what you could. It's not what you promise, but what you can keep, and what's happened. I've run around from theater to theater for months and always the same answer. We'll inform Miss HĂ¶gfeldt as soon as there is anything. Nanna, dear. We've had the radio. 30 or 40 kronor a time. Is that anything to live off? They treat me like a shadow of what I was. And a shadow doesn't need to eat, of course! -I'm so miserable I'm going crazy. -I know everything is hopeless. But for me this time has been useful, anyway. I've learnt so much. I have two people to thank for that. Fine protectors you have. Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt, an old fool, and Helge Berg, who's still wet behind the ears. Why do you say that? Is it to take away all my courage, what is it? Every person should know what they want. Don't beat about the bush, out with it! I think you should see Erik. He's been in town for two days now. You know I can't. I know exactly what he'll say to me. You understand that I don't dare? Every word he'll say is true! Are you afraid of the truth? Where are you going? I'm going out to get some fresh air. Oh, no. We haven't sunk so low. We'll crawl up together you and I. Laugh. That's it... See you soon. Then perhaps you understand that I've been the obstacle to her being hired. What does Monika say? It's not easy telling a girl who looks up to me that it's simply harmful to be seen with me. -Can't you help me? -It doesn't look that way. I've tried getting hold of her, but she resists. I want nothing but to help her. Excuse me. Hello. Yes, ask him to come up. Thanks. A gentleman is coming to discuss a construction Ferdinand and I are doing. -It's very important. -Really? How is he? -Who? -Ferdinand. Well, thank you. You see, I miss that... -Can't we meet in an hour in the studio? -No, are you crazy? You think I'd dare tell Monika that I contacted you? I'm so exasperated. I wish I had something... -...to wash down my tears. -I understand. -But you understand, this is so important -I think so, too. Yes... -Excuse me, I've had an unexpected visit. -By all means. I could return later? No, of course not. May I present bank director Mr Lindell. Miss HĂ¶gfeldt. Delighted. I'll never forget how splendid you were in Pygmalion. Oh, you saw that? Yes, it ran for a whole season. I've always admired you, Miss HĂ¶gfeldt. When you played in Mollusken. It was the most splendid theater evening of my life. And Camille. That was an experience! Those were the heydays. This is really a surprise. -Maybe we can leave the business to later? -But... -How about a glass of Champagne? -No, thank you. -What time is it, by the way? -The time is... half past five. Oh, I see. Well in that case, thank you. -Can you give me more white paint? -It's finished, use toothpaste. Is this a painting studio or rehearsals? I'm only asking. Half the cast is missing. Where is everyone? -Where's Nanna, Monika? -Here I am! Did you hear? Radio! My first big radio role. The cat in a children's program. -How about that! -Hello. I was so into it that when I saw a dog coming here I arched my back. Watch out! It's 15 kronor, sausages for a week! Do they need other animals? I'm as hungry as a wolf. If everyone runs off to the radio, this will all go up in smoke. You sound as if it's wrong for an actor to earn a crust. I didn't say that. But Greta quit yesterday after getting hired. -You think I'd say no if I got something? -It's youthful enthusiasm I'm fighting. I didn't hear her and don't want to. We're finished without further ado. Anyone know where Nanna is? -Nanna's at the bar. Here. -No, this is impossible. -We'll go through the second act. Hurry. -The second act? Helge, that's where I have my line! I have to compose myself. Can you lend me 1,000 kronor? Abroad? Oh, no. It's just that I don't appear on stage much these days. -That's unfair to the audience. -I'm interested in talented youngsters. To bring through another theater generation. It's an actor's duty to share some of the wealth of their experience. Yes. The youngsters I have now. Oh, how wonderful they are! Helge Berg, for instance. A superb director. And Monika Hall with her talent... That'll be the one to pick up my fallen mantle. -Is she so good? -Just ask Mr. Norrby. -She's magnificent. -Goodness, the third bottle! Is it already so late? I have to go home. My youngsters are rehearsing. -Miss HĂ¶gfeldt, I'd like to ask you... -Ask away! I've never really had much to do with the theater. I'd love to see you rehearse. That's the easiest thing on earth. Just come along. But we were going to discuss some business. Then come along as well. That will be fine. -And Monika? -I'll take care of Monika. Nothing is impossible with Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt. Whoops! It's a bit uneven here. Come in. It looks a bit messy. But it's not as bad as you think. You're looking at the statues, I see. -It's quite something. -Yes, a sculptor lived here before. -Really? -A childhood friend of mine. He couldn't pay the rent, poor man. So he was evicted. In his anger he took off all the arms and legs of his works. -Except that one, of course. -It's really good that one. That's me. I modeled for it. -You don't say? -That's what I looked like at the time. It was long ago. If I had a mouth I'd say so. I got the money to go home. If I only had the money you'd have it. But I don't have any. I don't know what to do. I'm tired... Report him to the police. It'd do him good to see he can't behave any old way! -That's Monika. -Should I report him to the police? No, I can't. I'd rather write home and say I have a position here. That's how you say a line. Just listen. -Hello, youngsters. -Hello, Nanna. Mr. Lindell, let me present Monika Hall. Isn't she just charming? And this is our big director, Helge Berg. Here are the other youngsters. This is Margit Larsson, Berit SĂ¶derstrĂ¶m... Hello, Erik. -You weren't expecting this, right? -Not exactly. -And didn't want this, either? -Well... -Where did you meet Nanna? -It's a long story. -Now that I'm here, can we talk? -Of course we can. Let's not stand here. Let's go. -Oh, yes. -That's right. You see, this represents a guesthouse which I run, with a wonderful view of StrandvĂ¤gen, and a delightful breakfast table already laid. Helge, continue playing the hostess. I should have understood that we'd meet when you were in town. I came here primarily for you. I want to know how you are doing. You haven't answered my letters. It hurts me. -Do you want me to leave? -You can't leave. Stay with me! If you only knew how I missed you. I was so scared to meet you because I thought you'd be bitter. -You can't leave me now. Stay with me. -You must stay with me. My work is successful, I don't need to worry about the future. -But what about me? -Monika... Everything I do, I do for your sake. -My future means nothing without you. -Your future? And my future? Should I give up or what do you want? You don't understand me. You've never understood me. Don't you see I need my own path? Where does it go, downwards? You've gone around the country for a year without doing one real role. Sorry, one... -My life's most beautiful, bitter night. -Just spit it out... And since then? Your seven months in Stockholm have been hell. -No. -Yes, I know they have been! I also know you've tried everything. But you no longer hope. You yourself don't believe in your career. I knew it would be exactly like this. That you'd try and disillusion me. -I can't help hurting you with what I say. -Then don't say it! I want to be honest with you. Monika... Don't make it harder than it is. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You've done what you could. I'm in love with you. -Isn't it enough one of us gets somewhere? -Yourself, you mean? That we'd drift so far apart. I never imagined... Erik, stop! Monika? -I have to go. -I don't want to meet the others. -Farewell. -Farewell. -When is the premiere? -I don't know. -You don't? -No, we don't have a theater yet. -But you're rehearsing! -We're actors. Let me tell you, in my time it wasn't so hard to get hold of a theater. If you just had a good play, a good director and Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt... Sorry... And a talented girl like Monika Hall, for instance. Then there was always someone who'd be honored to help young talent. Mr. Norrby apologizes, but he had to leave. -Is it already so late? -Yes. This was so charming, I forgot our business altogether. It was a pity I didn't see Miss Hall rehearse. But I hope to have the opportunity another time. Apollo Theater under new regime Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt starts with youth ensemble Please wait driver, you'll be paid in a minute. -Hello Mr. Andersson. How are you? -Hello, good thank you. -Goodness, is it already four o'clock? -Yes, it is. -Have they started rehearsals? -Yes, at 11. -Of course. -Parcels and flowers have come for you. -They have? Please take them to my office. -Of course. Do you happen to have 10 kronor? 10 kronor? Let me see. -Yes, here. -Please pay the driver. How much? He waited while I tried on six dresses. So there'll be no change for that... So, here's the entrance. You come in... -That's what I did. -But you go straight to counter. -Yes, okay. -Take the bowl and put it on the table. And that's when you say your line. Right? Try it again and let's see. Hello everyone! Yes, yes, I know you've been waiting for me. But I don't have time. Helge, I'll rehearse a little later. There's no one on this earth who's head is as full of dealings as mine. And everything for your sakes. Monika dear, I have to speak to you, please come up with me. Continue rehearsing, I won't be down in quite a while. I have a lot of things to do. Oh, yes... -Monika, I have to talk to you. -What is it? There's something very odd that I don't understand. I pay and I pay every day... And loads of bills have come, each one bigger than the last. Look here... What a lovely dress you have! -I got that from you yesterday. -Oh yes, I'd forgotten. -You have to help me with something. -What? It's something so strange. I'm so upset I don't know which way to turn. Thanks, Mr Andersson. Just put them there. -Have you bought more clothes again? -Well, I have to wear something! I don't know what's happened. The money just runs through my fingers without me noticing. Monika, dear. It would be easier for you to speak to Mr. Lindell than me. Wait a bit! Do you want these flowers? Look, every time I get flowers, they're for you. For me? Look. -They're from Mr. Lindell. -They're charming. -Let's see. He's asked me to marry him. -No! This is his answer to my answer. "Dear Monika. I'm leaving today. "If you change your mind, you know where to find me. "I hope you can continue with the help I've left you. "I wish you all the best, GĂ¶sta Lindell". Monika, you don't mean it? You may just as well go to the stage and tell them it's the last rehearsal day. -We haven't an Ă¶re left! -But Nanna! What have you done with the money you received? Received? He gave me money and I paid it. You give money to a person who's had less than nothing for ten years and insist she takes care of it. Every person who knows me knows that I can't look after money! -Then you say received... -Leave the Champagne! Don't you see what you've done! You've left 20 young people without their chance. You messed it up for yourself, and involved us all! And the money that is all of ours, you've thrown away on clothes and things. And what is this? An office in a theater? Nanna. Sorry if I was hard on you. I didn't think it was you. I'm so exasperated. What should we do, where will we go? Maybe there's one person who can help us. Yes, call Erik. You know what that means for me? The last remains of pride I had left. It's taking quite a while. I don't have time for this. You're used to talking to him, you go in and I'll wait. -I'll go in. -Yes. I'll say that Mr. Norrby wants 50,000 kronor for a theater! I've informed the director of the matter. Please go in. Right. Please come in. The works engineer told me of your suggestion and it seems a good one. You're a reliable man with us, Mr. Sund and it pleases me that it's you that have brought this to us. It's been fun to follow your development Mr. Norrby, I've been watching you. We'll need people like you if your invention proves as useful as we think. I suppose we'll agree. But it needs to be tested a little more. So we'll return to the matter another time. Yes, but... ...the thing is that we need a bit... -...a bit of money. -Really? And how much would that be? Fifty... Five thousand kronor. -55,000 kronor? -No, five. Yes, five thousand. Everything you need for your experiments you can get here. Yes, of course, but... -This would be more private. -Yes. -I see. Is it a family matter? -Yes. You mean that I would advance you 5,000 kronor? -Yes, if you... -Yes... It's a little bit of a surprise, but... I'll have to organize it, then. Go to the pay office. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Good morning. -Good morning. Oh, I'm tired. -Are you coming Nanna? -Yes. I always thought these stairs were long. -But never like today. -Come on, let's continue. What is it? I've heard of exhausted desert wanderers seeing water and things like oases. But it actually smells of mirage. Coffee! What in Heaven's name? You're crazy. You almost scared the life out of me. Really... -What are you doing here? -What kind of welcome is that? -Hello. -Hello. A telegram for you. The country folk are in town... "Coming with the 06:30 train. Erik". I see. -Shall I answer? -Yes, please. -Welcome. -Thanks. -Have you been at the theater until now? -Don't mention it. We're dying of fatigue. -We've been at it all night. -Poor you. -We have to do something for the money. -We've got some coffee for you here. You see, I smelt correctly! Come in, welcome. Follow me. Here's our little luxury apartment. -Did you wait long? -No, only a couple of hours. -We've really worked hard. -I understand that. Perhaps no one will believe me, but I am so tired. I can't even undress. Maybe a coffee to perk yourself up with is a good idea? A coffee, yes. That would be wonderful. Erik. Thanks for helping us. How is it going? Do you have a good role? I don't know. I'm so tired. I have so much to tell you. If someone would only take off my shoes. Oh, how lovely. -I'll have to heat this up. -What? No, I'll do that. Oh, yes... The gas is out there. It'll soon be ready. Are you happy to get your chance? If I wasn't so awfully tired, I'd be nervous. Then it's better you're tired. -Sleep, it will do you good. -Hey... The last time we parted, I didn't think we'd meet again. I knew we would. Erik? Hey... -Actually, I have a guilty conscience. -Why? This wasn't how we'd agreed I'd forge my career. With your help. But it's thanks to you that I am where I'm at. This evening we'll see how far I've come. Hey... I want to see you after the premiere. You're not angry, right? -Why would I be? -I just thought... -Is that any way to behave? -Quiet! Let them sleep. Quiet. -Perhaps it's best. -We'll leave. -Take this. -What for? You could have said it's hot! As intelligent as you are, I find it odd that you stay here. As intelligent as you are, I find it odd that you stay here. I have relations, let me tell you, I have relations, and really influential friends that can help you... Really influential friends... I could find you a position that would suit you. I could find you... Damn, why can't I get it right? I could find you a position that would really suit you. This is no future for you. How can you breathe this air? -Why are you looking at me like that? -What are you doing? Nothing. I'm going through the role. I'm not sure of my lines. -Don't tell me you have stage fright? -Stage fright? -I'm just nervous. -You know what? If I'm nervous as a beginner, it isn't strange. But you, Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt. This is nothing. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know how it feels coming back to Stockholm after ten years after everything I've been through. I suddenly have to reveal myself like a Phoenix. If you knew how good you were yesterday. Helge had tears in his eyes. Yes, because I had people around me that like me. But tonight, let me tell you, they'll be all lined up in rows. My old, dear friends, who want nothing more than a complete fiasco for Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt. But, it won't happen. -You have flowers, Monika. -Are they for me? -Nanna, they're for you! -For me? -Here. -"Good morning. Ferdinand". Heavens! -That's sweet. -Just imagine. Before he left this morning, he put a blanket over me. It was so thoughtful. You know, I regret nothing in my life, but their money is too much for me. -Their honestly-earned money. -You sound as if we'd already lost it. But it depends on us and that's what makes me nervous. But Nanna, Luminal again? Don't you remember what the doctor said, it's dangerous to take too much. Don't get all nervous. You'll see that everything will be alright. Hurry up... PREMIERE SHIPWRECK You see? -There are two tickets for Mr. Norrby. -Mr. Norrby... Here you go. -Thank you. -There's no payment necessary. -No? Thank you. -You're welcome. -They didn't cost anything. -I think they cost quite a bit. -You're also curious to see her? -Of course. When Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt is on stage, you get value for money. One way or another. Look here. It was her that was so magnificent she got me to finance this. Karin Lund is here. Good evening. This will be an interesting evening. Good evening. -Who was that? -I have no idea. No, neither do I. -Are you ready? -No. -Can I come in? -No. -I wanted to tell you it's sold out. -Really? That, as well? Monika, now's the time! -It's totally full. -I'm so nervous. -You don't need to be nervous. -What if it doesn't work? Shall we launch this thing? Can't you stop? I want to be left alone. Go away! I have to rehearse. It hurts me, but I must state that I have been robbed. But Heavens, that Monika's line! Where is mine? What's the matter with me? Oh, yes, I come in and say: You wanted to see me? Then there's her bit about being hurt. It's hopeless. How can I answer that. I don't know whether I'm coming or going. "And hast unlearned thy kissing? "Why is my heart so anxious, on thy breast"? Oh, Heavens! What is it with me? I'm suddenly doing Margaret in Faust. Lord! Oh, Heavens! What is the matter with me? I hope I can calm down. I wonder how far they've come? -I assure you. -Don't play innocent out here. -You knew why I came into your room. -You should be ashamed. -Don't try. -Give me back the money. You know very well why I need it. I'm going to leave this place. -I see. All the more reason to keep it. -Then do it. You need it, too! -And I know for who. -Really? It wasn't only about the money. It was the investment that bothered you. -You're the meanest brute I ever met! -You don't hold back. Nanna! Nanna! -Open up, Nanna. -Isn't she ready? You have to be on stage in a minute! Why aren't you answering? Come on, Nanna, open the door! You hear me, Nanna? You have to get on stage. -What is it? -Go and fetch something. -A Cognac? -No, keys, a cloth. We must open the door! Nanna, don't you see this will ruin everything? Monika can't be alone on stage. It'll be a scandal! Don't think I'm scared of you. Don't you understand you're forcing me to talk to your mother? If there's one thing that doesn't impress me, it's a threat. Especially when it's not supported by force of arms, as it's called. To prove that to you, I'll send for the President. Pelle, I beg you! Pelle! Mother, Miss Birgit would like a word. Bye. Why isn't Nanna coming? She can come by all means. It doesn't matter. I'm not afraid at all. I'll have my say if they come. -Isn't she coming? Monika won't last. -What can we do? Hurry up! -Nanna! -No, this is a delicate matter. Nanna, what's the matter? -Don't you see you have to go on? -Leave me alone. Let me be. -Are you ill? -Yes, I'm ill. I can see. Come, Monika is alone on stage! I don't want to. I can't! Why doesn't she come, then? -Perhaps she doesn't dare. -A courageous girl. You wanted to see me? It hurts me, but I have to tell you I've been robbed. -It's over now. -What? My dear, if you use... My dear, if you use that tone! My dear... -If... -Yes. I know what you're going to say. That I've been here three weeks without paying rent. You've wanted to throw me out ten times. But what can I do? You've never had the money. Nanna? Nanna! I know exactly what you think. That I never received the money. But I did receive the money. I got it to go home. I can't stay here anymore. I don't want to stay. Everything scares me and I'm afraid! Nanna. Nanna! Nanna? Don't you understand? I came here to Stockholm full of expectations! Nanna, look at me. Look at me! I was so happy with everything and my whole life would be different! Nanna, look at me. Look at me. I believed in everything. I believed. It's gone now. I've lost everything. Every hope, every ounce of self-confidence. Everything I liked. Curtain! Everything. Everything I liked. Destroyed! -Is that the end? -No, there must be something wrong. Ladies and Gentlemen. Unfortunately the performance must be discontinued. Miss HĂ¶gfeldt has suddenly become indisposed. Refunds are available in the ticket office. I'll try and find Monika. Wait for me out there. -Here you are. In here. -Thank you. -Miss Hall. I can't tell you how sad I am. -I can't right now. I have to go. Forgive me. -Hello, Mr. Norrby. -Hello. What happened? Where's Miss Hall? She's with Miss HĂ¶gfeldt. A minute, it's not appropriate right now. -Why not, why...? -Ah, so it's like that? I should've invested in your invention rather than finance a theater. It looked promising initially, but then... -You put me together with Miss HĂ¶gfeldt. -Yes. So I helped with this. Did you finance the theater? Sometimes you let emotions get the better of reason. Monika Hall is a charming girl. But she'll manage her career without my help. Look me up one day and we'll talk business! -Hello, Harald. -Hello. -So it went as expected. -Well... That Monika Hall, she's something to look out for. A real find! Let me tell you when I first saw her... -How was it? -Later. Let's get back to the steelworks. We should never have left! SHIPWRECK IS A SHIPWRECK EMBARRASING PREMIERE AT THE APOLLO THEATER Monika Hall goes to Royal Dramatic Theater Big Promise, says Artistic Director STRINDBERG'S EASTER IN NEW STAGING A charming "nestling" Monika Hall conquers the public Royal Dramatic Theater special performance Monika Hall as Ophelia in Hamlet NATIONAL THEATER WITH "ROMEO AND JULIET" THEATER THAT GOES RIGHT BY US ROYAL DRAMATIC THEATER TOUR THE MAID OF ORLEANS Malte? Who might be... Is that Nanna? Let me see you! Come in so I can speak to you. Oh, yes. -When I was here last you were away. -Unfortunately. It was the last chance to celebrate Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt as an actress. -You talk... -Oh, yes. What can I do for you, Nanna? Malte, I've never asked you for anything. And I won't now, either. It's not for me I'm asking. Last time, I was hoping you'd throw a dinner for me. Pity I wasn't home. But now you can repair that harm. By giving a late dinner. And there are two young people that I'd especially like you to invite. Couldn't you explain more? It's our old story that's repeating itself. The only difference is that it will end a little differently this time. It's Monika Hall who's performing here this evening as you may know. -Yes, I saw that. -And Mr. Norrby. Mr. Norrby, the engineer? Nanna, this is awfully similar to an intrigue. I'm sure it's magnificent in that you're conducting it. Promise me you'll go with Mr. Norrby to see the performance tonight. I promise. I'll go with him to the theater. And his eyes radiate peace. And a sun of beautiful emotions break out. He's crying. He's bound. He's bold! -Please excuse me. -By all means. It was a wonderful audience today. My dear, what is it? -Erik was in the audience. -Really? -Well? -He just sat staring at me the whole time. -He was gripped, my dear. -Oh, no. He was the only one that didn't applaud. -Who is that? -I don't know. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Sorry, I'm in the wrong place. -No, quite the opposite. Come in. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Am I interrupting you? -No, not at all. Monika. I just wanted to say that you were magnificent this evening. I've read about your successes these past years. But I couldn't have dreamt you were so good. You didn't applaud. I couldn't. For the others, you were Joan of Arc. -But I thought of so much else. -Of what? That you abandoned me when I needed you most? -I abandoned you? -Yes, two years ago. But that's so long ago, we won't get into it. -Why not? -No. -It was rather you that abandoned me. -Me? In what way? I wasn't needed anymore. You had a stronger supporter. Stronger supporter? What do you mean? -Mr. Lindell. -Mr... Lindell the banker? Oh, please Erik. Did you think? Oh, heavens! He helped us with our theater plans. That was all. I wouldn't have accepted help from you if there'd been something between him and me. -He told me straight out. -What did he say? That he'd financed the theater for a woman's sake. -And that woman was me? -He said so. No, Erik... My dear... And that's all that's kept us apart for two years? We've been so silly, both of us! -Can I see you tonight? -Just like before? Yes! -We'll talk about everything. -Yes. Will you fetch me after the performance? Good. I have to hurry now. Cross your fingers for me. And if I'm good, after the next act... A little bit, okay? But... Goodness! -I've been invited later. To your boss. -Me too. -It'll be hard to manage. -What should we do? So, I ask you all to come together and thank Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt for all that she's given to us of her great and beautiful art. -Cheers, Nanna. -Cheers. Cheers. Thank you. After all the charming exaggerations Mr. Brundin has said about Nanna HĂ¶gfeldt, I would like to say a word about her - she is retiring. But Thalia is not dead for that. She's not even ill. She lives healthily and energetically and gives birth to new litters one after the other. I've had the privilege of serving her all my life and will still do so in my little manner. I think the only real thing for an artist is that she doesn't draw a line between theater and life. And living life a little in illusion is, I think, the only right way. This is what I've done! -Cheers to you all. -Cheers. Bravo! That was probably my last applause. Well, I... I'd like to... The porch is finished now. And there are geraniums. Thank you. Cheers. My dear friends, don't worry, I won't hold another speech. I merely wanted to give an explanation for these two empty chairs all evening. I'd hoped to have as guests this evening Monika Hall and Mr. Norrby. But it so happens that Mr. Norrby is currently occupied with an extremely meaningful experiment. It's as if we were here yesterday. So silly I've been. You? Us... Imagine, you thought it necessary to have a career. The main thing is that we love one another. They're waiting up there. Let them wait. I've been waiting for years. Subtitle translation by Alexander Keiller
