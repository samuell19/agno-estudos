[dramatic music] [police siren wails] [police walkie talkie chatter] [man] So he snapped and walked over to his horse, and got it by the ears, and said, "Listen, you stupid horse, bring back a pasi!" [laughs] All right, guys, listen up. Listen up. As you know this is the big fish, this is not another low level narco bust. The department has been building this case for a long time. Miguel Aguirre, street name, Hades. Former member of LA's 18th Street Gang. Wanted for drug smuggling, kidnapping, arms dealing. Basically every flavor of trafficking in the book, you name it, he's had a taste. [man 2] Two weeks ago, he was hiding in plain sight downtown, 48 hours ago, officer Mills undercover went into the Spring Street warehouse with him. Under no circumstances is Aguirre to be harmed. Even if he has a Glock aimed at your head, - you still take him alive, understood? - Yes, sir. This is the first break in the wall to bring down the scaesa syndicate, pull this one out and the rest will come tumbling down. [dramatic music] [exhales] [gun clicks] All right, let's rock this shit. [guns click] Green light, people, green light. Here we go. - All good, dawg? - All good, man. Just, just nervous. I had to clear my head up a bit. Just in time for the party. Oh, I'm ready for a party. Come on, man. The boss is waiting for you. Absolutely. - [moans] - [rap music plays] [woman] Fucking faster! [chuckles] Everyone's so serious. [laughs] The bad guys. Just playing with you, man. Here, papi, special friend. [chuckles] [inhales smoke] You want to taste? - No, man. - Got to stay sharp. We didn't come here for this type of business. [laughs] Present for you, papito. You ever danced with the angel before? Shit. [both laugh] - First time for everything, right? - See? See? I knew I can count on my man right here, huh? - [man] Pop your cherry, old boy! - Absolutely. [coughs] - Holy shit! - Yeah. [laughs] - [woman] Come to your mama, papi. - [Miguel] Get away from me. Don't blow out that shit, bro. You got to save it, for the party later. I am the motherfucking party. Fuckers. They'll turn on me if I don't keep them medicated. - You're damn right. - I know you of all people understand how hard it is to get good help these days. But this one here, see the one right there, he's loyal. Es mi hermano, my gringo brother, you know? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm naming my next son after him. - Best gift I can give to anyone, right? - Yeah. His name becomes part of my legacy. Part of the history books, right? Ain't that right? Man, if you ain't got loyalty, you ain't got nothing. See? That's what I'm saying, 100 proof, baby. - 100 proof. - Yeah. [laughs] Hey. Speaking of history books, we got to get this deal going. [clears throat] How much are we talking? Five billion in product. [whistles] That's some pride cheddar, man. [Mills] That's a lot of feria, shit. [laughs] It's clean? Clean and fresh. Untraceable? Just got to have the man power to push it through under the radar. I got the DEA, Xander has got the Feds. [Mills] If you want my help I can get the local PD. Shit. [Takayama] I didn't come here to waste time. Sounds like we've got a plan then. [laughs] Hannah, did you know, if you touch the G spot and the clit at the same time, it takes a screenshot of the pussy? [laughs] No, bitch, I didn't know that. - Come on guys, let's go. - Let's go. I'll show you my crotch later. [dramatic music] [moans] - Wait, stop! Stop! - No, fucking go. Let's go! I said, fucking stop! What the fuck? What? Policia! Policia, man, fucking Five-O! Motherfuckers cannot wait two minutes? Five-O, fucking Five-O, man, let's go! [dramatic music] Keep on listening to the musica, hijo. You don't need to see any of this. [breathes heavily] - Got the routing digits ready, when you are. - Let's do it. Yo, Hades, man, we got Five-O outside. Fuck you mean? Outside, the fucking police man! Go! We got SWAT outside, man. - How many? - I can't tell. Enough to do some damage though. - [screams] - [fires] Shots fired, shots fired! [gun shots] All right, lock the place down. They're about to come in hard. On the artillery, now! - On it! - Move it, boss, upstairs! Get them out on every window! - [screams] - [fires] Fuck you! [sniper fires] No, this is a mistake, nobody knew about this! - What the fuck are we supposed to do with these? - Protect your investment. They're here, they're got to be here by morning. [Blackjack] We don't give a fuck, let them come. [Hades] This is not what I signed up for. [gunshots] [screams] Clear! [dramatic music] Okay. Clear! You fucking bastards! [guns fire] Shoot to the right, on the right! We got a man down! We got a man down! [guns fire] Son a bitch. [guns fire] Go, go, go! [guns fire] [Hannah] Get down. [guns fire] Oh, shit! Motherfuckers! [groans] [guns fire] [groans] Fucking bitch, fuck you! Go! Son of a bitch. Clear! [calm music plays on headphones] [dramatic music] [gunshots] Drop it, Blackjack, drop it! [Blackjack] Cease fire, cease fire! Put it down! I knew it, I knew you were a fucking cop! [breathes heavily] Put it down. [grunts] - [fires] - [gunshots] No, you son of a bitch! [guns fire] - These motherfuckers! - [fires machine gun] [gunshots] [policeman] Clear! Don't be scared, what did she tell you? She tell you something about me, huh? Huh? Scared, huh? Huh? We have a hostage, we have a hostage! - Miguel, put him down! - Yo, you call me Hades, motherfucker. Fuck that shit, put the kid down! Put him down! Check this out, only one way this shit's going to go down, homie, I'm going to slice this kid throat like fucking butter, that's how this shit goes down, nigger. No, it's not, not now. I'll blow your fucking head off. Yo, I die, he dies. Think about it. Let that shit haunt you. Yeah, let my face haunt you, man. I die, he dies. I die, he dies. - I die, he dies. - Drop it! Don't make me pull the trigger. Don't make me kill you. Yo, I brought you into my home, man. I introduced you to my wife and shit, man. I was going to name my son after you, man. Don't make me kill you! [speaks Spanish] Homie, you got blood on you now fucking anyway, here. Happy? Go die bitch. Die. Die, motherfucker, die. That's my kid, man, you think I'm going to slice my own fucking kid, man? Nigger, what the fuck? Oh, look, he's dead, yeah, go get him. Go get your bitch boy. Harry Charles Manson. Nigger, hey, who's Charles Manson? [police sirens] Keep squirming and I'll have to break both your wrists. I'm not American citizen, I'll call Interpol on you. My lawyers, I'll bankrupt everyone in your family. - [speaks Japanese] - Heard that before. What is that? Kid's got an imagination. Coo Cooi? What does that mean, Coo Cooi? I don't really know. - Hey. - Hey. You did good, man. Thanks. How's Mills? Bad. All right, you guys got to head out. Whoa, wait, why? Because they said so. Oh, they said so, really? - Are we really going to do this now, sir? - Yeah, we are. [man] Look, this is not the time nor place. Excuse me, I was shot at today. Where were you? Oh, that's right, sitting behind your fucking desk, right? Yeah, behind a desk, doing my job. Look, I think my friend wants to know why we have to leave. Four of these perps were competing syndicate bosses, something big was going down, and the Feds want in. - You got to be kidding me. - I wish I was. Look, I'm no happier about this than you. I want a statement from everybody as soon as possible, and forget you were ever here. A year and a half of the department's time and a man in the hospital and this is how it goes down. You know I don't make the rules, Maddox. Trust me, this is just as frustrating for us as it is for you. - It's bullshit. Let's get out of here. - Yeah. - [rock music playing] - [laughing] Cheers, fuckers. Hey, to kicking ass, fucking shit up, and the FBI fucking it all over in the end. - And here's to Mills. - Oh, yeah, to Mills. [all] To Mills. And before I forget, there is a person here, finding it hard to give a scumbag like me the time of day, and consider a major life change. [laughs] [indistinct] Fuck you. Oh! And then cheers to modern day social standards, sexual appropriation despite you live in the fucking dark ages. Cheers! - I love you, homeboy. - I love you, homegirl. [Vernon] God, you guys are too cute. I need to get vodka and Red Bull, you got it. [rock music playing] Thanks! [barman] There you go, whisky on the rocks. Thanks, Jake. And of course, guys, it's on the house. That's like $10,000 worth of free drinks you've given us by now. Well, it seems like you guys had a rough night. Yeah, it always is. Don't worry about the drinks, shits wearing down anyway. [chuckles] Shit got real back there, didn't it? It sure did, but it always does. Yeah. I knew Mills would deliver, he's a good cop. He deserves a nice long vacation after this. Yeah, he does. And once he pulls through he's going to go straight into witnessed protection. Like I said, a nice long vacation. By the way, I got those... those papers. What papers? Those countersigned divorce papers, my wife served me before I came in today. Served me like a goddamn criminal, - not even like her ex husband. - [scoffs] And I already feel like shit today. I mean, I really feel like shit. And you look like shit, too. [laughs] So at least you match. Thanks for the pick me up, bro. So, now that you're officially divorced. Yeah. Come here, sweetie. Welcome back to the meat market, my friend. - Hello there. - Oh, Jesus. Hi, hello there. - How are you doing? - I'm doing just fine. [rock music playing] [woman] Don't touch, dude. Would you like to dance? Yes, I'm going to arrest you. - Already? - Mm-hmm. What? You got big hands. Oh, yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry. [laughing] Yes! [Kai] Guys. Guys! Bad news. What, perp got out already? No. Mills didn't make it. Yeah, that was the department calling. [sighs] Final toast, to brother Mills. May he rest in peace. To Mills. Godspeed, brother. [man] We've got seismic activities. [radio chatter] Hey, Vern. Hey. Did you tie one on last night? Yeah. And you didn't call me? - I should have. - You should have. Well, he's just finishing up with a patient. He'll be with you shortly. - Super. - [news reporter] Ground reports of unusual weather in a down weather satellite. Each which has led to wild speculation and conspiracy theories ranging from fracking accidents to an alien invasion. [news reader] Scientists have been scratching their heads over latent blossoming cloud formations, which were seen in the mesosphere, the region and the earth's atmosphere... Sorry, I had an emergency early. Oh, that's all right. I'm not going anywhere. How's work been? Well, people are still trying to kill me. I guess it's too late to tell you about my malpractice lawsuit. [chuckles] Sorry, still no sleep? No. I just can't get used to being in the house by myself, you know, I'm just, uh, just restless. I mean, if I can work 24-hour shifts, I would. That's about what I end up working here. See, that's the good life. Good life. See? [phone notification] Ah. Sorry. Sorry about that. So, what's going on, I mean... Got your blood work results. Let me guess, too much red meat. Possibly. You know, I had a vegan try to kill me once, still can't do it. Have a look. Okay. I'm not sure what I'm looking at. - It's cancer, Vernon. - What? Myeloma, it's a type of blood cancer... I know what myeloma is. Luckily it's early, there are no symptoms yet. Look, when can we start treatment? I'll bring you in every three or four weeks. It's... We'll go from there. - Chances of survival are... - I know what the prognosis is, and it's bad. When can we start? Well, we're not going to do anything yet. I would put you on chemo, but there's only a very small percentage of survival rate on that. I've been studying this for 20 years and I've had some fortune with some studies that were done in China. [police siren wails] What the hell was that? You tell me, I can't drive after some tequila, with this kind of shit happening on the road? Shut up, man! I'm getting tired of your fucking shit. Hey, Hey. Hey. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Why does all the crazy shit got to happen at the end of the shift? I'm going to call it in. Dispatch, this is officer Hanson. It looks like we got a weird electrical disturbance - over by Gates Canyon. - [cop on radio] Copy that officer. - Check in when you have visual. - Copy that. When we have visual? I think we already have visual. Seriously, man, we don't got nothing until something jumps out of this. I think a fucking lightning bolt just jumped out at us. It's two hours before our shift ends, you're going to start? Is your blood sugar low or something? Look, I had my protein shake before I came in, all right? That shit fucks with your head, you know that, right? Lovely, lovely, lover's quarrel. Hey, shut up! [siren wails] - Whoa. - Whoa. That's... unusual. [drunk guy chuckles] Seriously? Dispatch, do you read me? Do any units out there read me? This is Hanson. Jesus. Your turn? I don't think Jesus wants a turn. Look, I took the last one, this one... all yours. All right, that 70-year old prostitute. 75, and you owe me big time for that shit. 75 years old. I mean, that's got to be a record. Look, when we're done here, I'm getting another unit to take this guy. - [drunk guy] Cool, bro, cool. - Good. [drunk guy] Seriously, you guys are like the worst cops in the entire planet, I swear. Watch yourself. I think maybe you should probably go with him, man. I think you should hold his hand. Shut up! Shut up or I'm going to handcuff you to a fucking cactus out here, man. [tense music] What in the actual fuck? Dispatch. This is Hanson, does anybody read me? [explosion] - Fuck! - Is that the fucking satellite? I don't fucking know, man, let's just go! - [groans] - Oh, shit! Oh, shit, man, come on! Get me out of here! Oh, shit, man! Get me out of here, man, come on! Get these fucking handcuffs off of me! Come on! Get me out of here! [screams] [dramatic music] [man on radio] ...there are no such things, but something big... something that made it through the earth's atmosphere intact [tense music] You're late. I tried calling. I'll fill you in later. What's up? Last minute request from the Feds. - Suit up. - All right. - You doing okay? - Yeah, ready to rock and roll, sir. [Maddox] So this morning threats came in on Miguel Aguirre's life, not the typical social media bullshit, the real deal. [Vernon] I thought the Feds were handling that. [Maddox] Yeah, well, they specifically requested us to move him to county and keep him on a 24-hour watch. - There's cartel in the county. - Yeah. - [helicopter chuffs] - [pilot] I've got eyes in the sky, boys. Eyes in the sky. Keep him in sight. [whistles and chuckles] Hey, hey. How you been? Come on, bring it, baby. You're back in your fucking element, aren't you? - Huh? - I missed you, man. Yeah, I missed you too. [laughs] Nothing like the smell of middle aged testosterone in the morning. Agent Caprice, FBI. I'm going to be accompanying you on this little adventure. I don't think so. Feds do not ride with us. [radio chatter] [pilot] Yeah, check in five, boys, can you confirm that? [Caprice] So you're the heroes? Who are you looking for, Mills? Can't wait to meet him. I'm sure you can't. Where is he? He's in the morgue. [chuckles] - Sorry to hear that. - I'm sure that makes him feel much better. Let's get out of here. Eyes on the prize, coming out. [Hannah] Keep the chatter down in case someone hacks the channel. Copy that. [tense music] Coming in hot. [pilot] ETA, five minutes. [tense music] [cop] Kills my fucking partner with some... octopus shit. What the hell? What is all this? God. I don't get it. What's happening? [whistles] Don't they teach you to make calm in situations like this? Let's say I had a gun stashed. Or shit, a grenade. I pull the pin, you're going to make calm then? Or what if my boys offed another one of you all like that snitch motherfucker last night? - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Hey, hey, hey! [Maddox] Hey, come on, he wants you to do this. He wants you to do this. Calm down. - Calm down. - [Hannah] Calm the fuck down. - Easy, come on. - [Miguel chuckles] Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I want to see. Yeah, yeah, that's what I want to see, some real cop shit. The kind of cop shit that gets you on the news, and all over social media, yeah, yeah. [chuckles] [siren wails] [newsreader] This just in, citizens are being advised to stay in their homes. [tense music] What the hell is that? What is that? - Can you see it? - I see it. You see this from the office, right? Hey, look at this! You're throwing off my vibes, Coli. I said, look at this! Yo what's up, everyone, it's Dallas. Coming at you live from the heart of Los Angeles. I'm going to take you guys to the walk of fame, the Hollywood sign and my personal favorite, last but not least, Vivid entertain... [rap music playing] And also, an alien invasion. Oh, shit! [siren wails] [pilot] Guys, I'm getting some interference with the radio. [explosion] [Tobias] What the fuck happened? Shh! [chuckles] Cartel's got anti-aircraft weapons now? Buddies of yours? [chuckles] Boom. [siren wails] [car explodes] No. Fuck, I missed my pudding. - Oh, what the hell, assholes? - I'm sorry. You're very sorry, you son of a bitch. Hey, hey, let me in! No, no, no, no. [yelling] Drive, drive! Go, go, go, go, go! - Who are you? - Hey, just drive! Drive! - Lady, get out of my car. - I'm going to push you right into traffic if you don't drive. - I think you better do what she says, man. - Go! Okay, fine! Fine! - [old lady] Just drive! - [tires screech] Motherfucker! [tense music] [car beeps] Dammit, no, no, no! - What is it? - The van's dead. - What do you mean the van's dead? - It's dead. Well, make it undead then. I'm trying. [old lady] You don't know how to drive. Oh! Stop hitting me. Stop hitting me, lady. - You're going to get us killed. - First of all, that thing's what's going to get us killed. [spaceship roars] Jesus Christ. Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Stop cursing, it's fucking judgment day. Dammit, hold on to something and pray. Come on, man, you've got it. Come on, you've got this. [groans] It's been a good life. I'm coming, Rito, I'm coming up to see you, Rito. Not today, Satan. Not today. What the hell are you doing? [spaceship roars] [screaming] [sirens wail] Atul? Atul! Shit. [alien growls] [gun clicks] [Tobias] What the fuck happened? - [grunts] - I don't know. Everyone all right? [Maddox] Yeah, anybody hurt? Just my feelings. Cargo good? I'm going on, baby. Yeah, whatever. Any idea what happened? Someone had to have hit us. If they did it wasn't explosives, something else. Snipers maybe, blew out the tires? No, the choppers would have seen it. I'm pretty sure the chopper went down. No signal. Anybody else? I got nothing. 911's down too. Shit. [alien growls] [fires gun] Fuck! You want it? Come on! [siren wails] What the hell is going on? [people screaming] Oh, shit, man. The tires are intact. The snipers maybe? No. It's not a bullet wound. Hey, man, you can't help a brother out? What? A tooth. [spits] [laughs] You know what? I think I'm going to start calling you tooth fairy. Yeah. [laughs] How's that for a motherfucking tooth fairy? This doesn't make sense. If someone's trying to take us down, then what happened to everything else? No, I don't think this was planned. Come on, let's get out of here. Holy Mary Mother of God. [Maddox] What? Up, man. Look up. That's no cartel. [Maddox] No, it's not. [people screaming] Let's get out of here. Let's go, we got to move. Come on! [Tobias] Come on, we got to go. We got to go! Come on. It's four blocks to the county, and we're going to hotfoot it over there, - come on. - What the fuck is that? The hell does it look like, homeboy? Come on, people, we got to move! Hey, we got to help these people though, right? There's no time, we got to go. [van explodes] [dramatic music] Left! Left! Left! [gunshots] Move! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Move! Run, run! Go, go, go, go! Pick it up! Come on, go. - They're catching up! - Come on! Go, go! - Come on! - Bullets aren't doing anything. Pick it up! [explosion] Hustle, hustle, come on! Go, go, go, go! SWAT, SWAT, SWAT, SWAT! Go, go, go! [dramatic music] It's locked. You're going to let them in? No, let them figure it out for themselves. All right, back it up. [fires shotgun] They could have just knocked. - Clear! - Go, go, go! Get in here. [dramatic music] [alien hisses] - Whoa! - Fuck! - Shit! - Ah! - Oh, my God! - I got you. I got you. - I fucking got you. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Don't let go. [screams] - No! - [alien hisses] Fuck. [dramatic music] Jesus Christ! Fuck, what the hell is that? - It looks like my mother's vagina. - Shut up! The fuck? Close that goddamn thing out. [gun clicks] [gun fires] [alien growls] What the fuck is that thing? What the fuck are you? It does kind of look like vivid. [chuckles] Just like Vivid. [Vernon] You think this is a joke, huh? You think it's funny? People are dying out there, you understand? - Okay, I understand. - What the fuck is that? What the fuck is going on here? Fucking serpent. You saw that thing in the sky, right? That's impossible. [Maddox] You saw it just like I did. That's fucking impossible! You saw what happened, man! Fucking aliens! Actual fucking aliens, man. That's right, that's what's in the sky. Knocked out cell towers and broadcast capabilities. Yeah, they knocked out cars too. We closed the doors so we didn't get mobbed. Is this the only civilian you let in? Jesus. You didn't let any more in? - No. Yup. - That's it? Hendrix here is a little bit anxious. So, you brought the delivery. Yeah. [Weller] Put him in a cell. The rest of this place is like a bank vault, but we got to figure out how to seal off these front doors. People, listen. I know we got hit hard, but we need to be ready in case more of these things show up, got it? - Got it. - Yeah, I got it. So what's your story? [stutters] I'm a tourist. You got any training? I got second place in a Street Fighter tournament. So you're good with hand to hand, how about firearms, any weapons? I didn't place in a Mortal Combat tournament. Wait, what? Oh, you mean in person, like for real? I took Taekwondo in elementary school, if that counts. Everyone took Taekwondo in elementary. So you're worthless. I'm a podcaster from Texas. [Kai] It's not a real fucking job. Anyway, Let's drop the cargo, come on. Let's go. [inmate] Fresh meat. Fresh meat! Fresh meat! Fresh meat! Fresh meat! Fresh meat! Fresh meat! Fresh meat! Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [inmate 2] Let us the fuck out of here! Oh, here to keep me company, huh? [speaks in Spanish] - Open number three. - [door buzzes] [dramatic music] [welds] Cartel in here won't let your boy sit easy. He's not ours, he's property of the FBI. Prisoners know what's going on? As far as they know, its an earthquake. We tell them what's out there and they might get real Catholic real fast. I prefer them the way they are now. I'm Catholic. Nobody's perfect. Home, sweet home. I heard Mills played you really good. Hey, you know what? Do you... Hey, Miguel, do you like... coloring books? The fuck you mean coloring books? You know, coloring books. We were at your house... cleaning the mess up and... the girl's kid was drawing a picture... it kind of looked like that thing back there. It said Coo Cooi. - Coo Cooi? - [Vernon] Coo Cooi. I know the neighborhood kids use it, around Halloween, that name, it means a monster. You know what, man, it's funny, man, life's funny. I thought I was the monster. I don't know shit. Yeah, I kind of figured that. Always a pleasure. Let's go. You got an analog radio or ham radio, anything? None that are working. My comadre can fix it. Be my guest. I don't think radio shack's open if she needs any parts. She'll be fine. [thunderous roar] [alien coos] What the fuck's going on outside there, pigs, huh? Sounds like a building going down. [inmate laughs] It might be safer outside. Let's move. You feel safe? Let me out of here, I'll skull fuck every goddamn one of you with a baseball bat! Can you do me too? Can you do me too, bro? Move it along motherfucker! I'll take a baseball bat and shove it up your ass! - Kentucky style. - [laughs] [inmate] Bitch! You like that shit, huh? [inmate 2] Let me the fuck out of here! [inmate] Huh? You like that? You hear me? You good, man? You want to know if he's good? He said something was up? Yeah, I don't know if now's a good time. [calm music] Is it the ex wife? [sighs] I, I went to the... doctor's to get the results of my physical this morning. I have cancer. You're kidding me. Shit, Vernon. Yeah, it's, uh... myeloma. It's a, it's a... blood cancer. The survival rate is not good. I don't know what to say. You know what, brother, you don't have to say anything. I mean, it's, uh, it's my reward for... for a lifetime in public service. Okay, we got to get you out of here, we got to do something. You know what, let's just keep it between our selves right now, I don't want anyone else to know. I'll tell them when the time's right, all right? Absolutely. Of course. Thank you. - That's all we got. - All right. I don't know the last time anybody used these. That is not a fucking joystick. All right, we got two riot guns. We've got, uh, [counting] four or five Glocks, extra clips, flume grenade, got some knives, we got some tear gas, and every coed's favorite... pepper spray. I'm not sure that will be too effective. You know what, you don't know until you try. [chuckles] Yeah. Right. Agreed. Totally agree. So is this all we got? This is a jail house, not a police armory. [Maddox] You have cartel in here. [Hendrix] It's not our decision, man. We don't run the city. You may need the assist if one of them manages to break out. We don't want cartel to get any heavy artillery, now do we? It's like he said, it's not our decision. Way above our pay grade, bro. How's everyone ammo? Not good, wasted bullets on those things getting in here. Down a clip and a half. [indistinct] Hopefully these knives can do some damage. We just got to make sure every shot counts. That's going to be hard to do when we don't really know what we're dealing with, and our numbers are down. And in a place full of people who don't want us here. I'm sure if we stay in here long enough, they'll get in. We need to move on to something else. That's why I want to get that radio fixed. - Can I get you on that, comadre? - Definitely. [Maddox] C-Los, Kai, let's get you two on the roof. See what the damage is outside these walls, and we can figure out our next move. - Affirmative. - Copy that. Lee, go with them. They can't cover the whole roof alone. No problem. Thank you. What about me? I'm useful. Why don't you go play some fucking Punch-Out!!? Punch-Out!! I love Punch-Out!! My Ninja. No. Just no. [Vernon] All right, people, let's move. - Let's go. - [Vernon] Put all that ammo in that bag. Yes, sir. [dramatic music] [bag unzips] How does it look? I don't know. I got to check it out first. Well, let me know. Hey. Hey. I know it's tough, but we got to keep moving until we get a handle on this. Tobias was like family to me too. But we got to keep that mourning in check. Yeah. He was my dip shit little brother. I'll miss him. Yeah, me too. I'm going to go back downstairs. No, you're not. Your boss gave you orders. You're one of us now. Cool? Yeah. I'm cool. Good. [dramatic music] Shit. All right, all right. Now we're getting somewhere. [radio static] [chuckles] Fuck, yes. Oh, I still got it. If anyone can hear me out there... this is officer Hannah Paulson, we're in the county jail. We have few survivors, and we're low on ammo. If anybody can hear me, we'll sure as shit be grateful for the help. [radio static] So we just sit here and watch the world burn. It's not in my DNA. Not in mine either, but now we just got to sit tight and survive. Guys. Guys. The situation is apocalyptical out here, fellas. Stay safe down there. Jesus shown up yet? [C-Los] Nada de nada, señor. We got fires all around. There's fires all around? [C-Los] There's no way out. - At least not by ground. - Jeez. All right. Well, stay safe out there. [C-Los] I might be ready to pray. Okay, so here's plan B. Communications and transportation are both knocked out. What's the goal? It's the end of the world? No. It's psychological warfare. Paranoia, desperation. [Maddox] Right. People are strapped to their phones nowadays. Take them away and they panic, they don't know a world without them anymore. Yeah, like I said, the end of the world. - Agreed. - See? she gets it. So what's the end game? They're watching us. Yeah, but what's going on in their heads? Weakness, vulnerability, desperation. They're exposing our handicap. Exactly that. Finally you say something useful. Before cell phones and the internet, people were generally more self sufficient, something's broke you fix it. No phone, you knock on someone's door. They're going to sweep this building if they haven't already. - We need to be mobile, and not just for your sake. - Right. What's so special about him? We just got to go. All right, look, I see that I'm not your favorite person here, and for the record, I'm not disagreeing with you. But none of the vehicles work. You know what, we find out more about what we're fighting against. And how do you suppose we do that? The cargo. - [Weller] Cargo? - Yeah. Yup. [inmate] What, you don't think I look sexy? [inmate 2] You remind me of that greasy looking sasquatch, that booked me, boy. I told you earlier, I don't have shit to say to you. I just came by just to... say hi. - Did you miss me? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I missed you too. [Vernon] You know what, boys, this guy's about ready to snitch... and I know how you boys love snitches. You recognize this fool? I recognize him. The fuck you want? [Vernon] Coo Cooi. I told you before, I don't know shit about no Coo Cooi. [Vernon] Yeah, you do. You know maybe I can have these boys here, come in there and jog your memory. We need to do it this right here? [Vernon] Absolutely not. [door buzzes] [tense music] [aliens growl] You guys hear that? Yeah, we got ears, don't we? I can pick each one of them all from up here, if I had a .50 cal. Yeah. One shot from that .50 cal, and there'll be on you like ants on high fructose corn syrup. At least I'd have done my part. Anyone got a book? I can use a massage if you feel like that'll help out... with time. I don't think you're my type. You got a type during the apocalypse? [Lee] Yeah, not alien. Well, I guess that makes me alien then. [laughs] [alien growls] Yo, they need to stand so close to me? Making me uncomfortable. Got to compare ink, you're a fan? I know I'm comfortable. You boss? Yeah, I'm fine. You seen these things before? No. Heard of them though. Enlighten us. It was one of those stories that used to scare little kids. When I was a boy in Baja, my abuelo told me a story about his grandfather. How he used to trade with the settlers. [man 1] I don't recall seeing this on any map. [man 2] You could have said something before the ambush. Something's different here. I can feel it. This place is empty. It looks like somebody left in a great big hurry. What's that supposed to mean? - It means they were running for their damn lives. - Quite. I know the heat is getting to you, but this is enough. - Quiet. - Stop! One day he came to them... and the entire settlement was dead. - Go, go, go! - James! Go, go! Don't you take my brother! Come on! [grunts] [groans] [whimpers] [sings sadly] [whimpers] No, I love you. [alien roars] Bodies were there but... they had all the blood taken from them. "Vampiros del cielo," he called them. The vampires from the sky. Space vampires? That's the stupidest shit I've ever heard. Yo, I didn't come up with the name. I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to you, but that's what they are. They're here for blood. [alien growls] [Lee screams] [gun shots] Hijo de puta! [speaks in Spanish] What the fuck are you? It's pierde mierda. Mierda. [grunts] [groans in pain] [machine gun fires] [dramatic music] [alien hisses] [machine gun fires] Oh, shit! [groans in pain] Get the fuck off my planet. [alien hisses] [groans in pain] So how did they beat them? Never did. My abuel said they went from settlement to settlement, they come in, take the blood, destroy the town then split the next day. What do they use the blood for? It's their medicine. Take him back to his cell. - Oh, it's like that, huh? - Yeah, it's going to be like that. [gun fires] Put your gun down now, drop the gun! [aliens hiss] [aliens growl] [woman screams] - [gunshot] - [screams] [tense music] Hey, hey! Yeah, you. Shut up, man, shut up. Shut up! Shut up! Pussy ass, cosplay gothic motherfucker. Shut up, man! Shut the hell up. I got a costume in here. [alien coos] Sexy little nurse's outfit, want to see? [inmate] Shut up, man, shut up! Get me the fuck out of here! [inmate] The fuck's wrong with you? [alien growls] [dramatic music] [aliens hiss] - [whimpers] - It's okay, it's okay. [inmates scream] [screaming] No! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. C-Los. C-Los. Kai? They're all gone, chief. I see a light. [alien hisses] [dramatic music] [radio static] [Weller] They're coming. They're coming here. Goddammit, and we're sitting ducks. Then we make ourselves scarce. Wait a minute, there's a tunnel in the basement. It goes under the street to the precinct on the next block. How do we get there? Through the cell block, [chuckles] so we're screwed either way. You got to be fucking kidding me. [tense music] [whistles] [alien growls] [Vernon] Get over here. Here you go, brother. [Maddox groans] - New plan. - What? I stay here and you go. No, I... I can't do that. I'm not going to make it out of this room. I don't want to slow you down. - Hey. - What? You go get yourself well. I got this. I know you do. I know you got it. [brooding music] I know you do. [radio static] [man on radio] Paulson, Officer Paulson, you there? This is Sergeant Solon at Nellis Air Force Base, people alive down there? Gone, everyone... [radio breaks off] Oh, shit. Solon, this is officer Hannah Paulson, LAPD. Sergeant Solon. Sergeant Solon? [sniffs] Yo, yo! Yo! [breathes heavily] Took you long enough, man. Took you long enough to find me. Holy shit, well, you're real. [chuckles] I know who you are. You ain't no Coo Cooi. You're my father, huh? Yeah. What's up, Dad? What's up, Dad? You did this, right? You made me like this, right? You're a bad ass, man? You ain't shit, bro. I'm worse than you. I'm worse than you. [fires gun] [dramatic music] Come on Dad, you killed me a long time ago, Dad. It's good to see you again, Dad. It's good to see you again, Dad! [grunts] - [skull breaks] - [screams] Solon. Solon? - Can you send someone for us? - Hannah. Hannah. We got to go. We got to go. [Hannah] I got someone on the radio. It's the military. He said everyone's gone. Yeah, right. Hey, look. You came in here with us, now you're one of us. Let's get out of here, come on. [radio static] [Solon] Paulson, you there? [tense music] Hey, get anything useful from Aguirre? [Vernon] It's an old Mexican legend. They're here for a blood harvest. They use human blood for medicine. The tunnels aren't far, two lefts and a right. A blood harvest? Where's the rest of the team? [Vernon] They're gone. They're all gone. [alien hisses] [dramatic music] [alien growls and hisses] [tense music] [gunshots] [breathes heavily] Come on, you son of a bitch. Come on! [gun fires] [Dallas] What the... [Hannah] Get behind me. Stay close. [Dallas] Shit, shit, shit, shit! Hadouken! [gun fires] Come on! Come on. Come and get it. Come here, you fuck! Come on! [gun fires] [grunts] [Dallas] Shit. What is that? [screams] What the hell it that? Ah! [alien growls] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck do you want? You want blood, you want what's inside me? - [alien hisses] - Huh? Take it. Take it! [dramatic music] [tense music] [groans] [Dallas] Holy shit. [Vernon] Let's move. There's nothing we can do here. [alien hisses] [alien growls] If the precinct's clear, we can get some ammo, supplies, whatever we need to keep moving. Slinging over a mule here. Wait, there's animals down here? [alien hisses] Did he say anything about everybody being gone? The signal was bad, I don't know what he meant. If it was just the base or... worse. Assume worse. It's the end of the world, duh. He said something about a helicopter, but he didn't say when or where. Probably scanning the area for survivors. Assuming it's safe, I say we get to the roof. Lights some flares, just in case. [dramatic music] [tense music] [alien growls and hisses] [exhales] [alien growls] [exhales] [falling clutter] [dramatic music] Can you help me? Can you help me? Come here. It's okay. Here you go. Lie down. That's bad. I'm not going to make it, am I? I'm sorry. One thing... before you go... can you help me with the pain? Yeah. I can, uh... I can... I can make it stop. I promise. [woman cries] I promise. [gunshot] I hope that was him. Vernon? Vernon? Any survivors? No. I'm sorry. Regular rounds won't hurt them. What will? Hollow points. Yeah. Yeah, you're on fire. Fucking nuclear. Let's give it a try. [gate clicks open] [gate clangs shut] [lift hums] God, I feel old. That's not my problem. I'm young... ish. I mean, I couldn't have come down here, when I was like... 20. - Enjoying your vacation? - This fucking sucks, I was supposed to see the Hollywood sign today. You're safer in here, trust me. Hey, buddy, if we make it out of here... I'll take you there myself. That'll be cool. If it's still there. [alien hisses] [dramatic music] Wait a second. [alien hisses] It found us. Can this thing go any fucking faster? It's here! - [guns fire] - It's here. [alien hisses] [groans] Fuck! What the fuck is that? Shit! - [screams] - [gunshots] - [Hannah] I'm out. - [Vernon] You're out? Re-load. [gun fire] [Hannah] Back. [alien growls] What the... Ah! [machine gun fires] [alien growls] [guns fire] I got your backs! I got your backs! [groans] [gasps for air] Told you I can be helpful. You are one of us. [metal clangs] [brooding music] Let's go. Yeah. Let's go. [tense music] Where the hell is it? [alien growls] [gunshots] - Fuck! - Come on! Cover me. [Vernon] Come on. Come on, get me. Get me. Come on! - [cocks gun] - [fires] Do it! Do it! - [gun clicks] - Come on. [alien growls] Kill me, you motherfucker! Come on! Huh? What's wrong? Yeah! Come on! Come on! Come and get it. You ugly green, fucking son of a bitch, come on! - Come on! - [alien hisses] Go ahead. Go ahead. What, you know what's wrong with me? Huh? I'll tell you, I'm dying. I'm dying. You don't like that, do you? You don't want to take me? I'll take you. Go ahead! Go ahead! Come on! - [gun clicks] - Hey, fuck face. [shot gun fires] You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. [dramatic music] - What the fuck is that? - I don't know. [spaceship buzzes] Shit. [water drips] [coughs] Vernon? Vernon! [breathes heavily] [grunts] [coughs] [grunts] Fuck. [coughs] [aliens chatter] [alien hisses] [tense music] [alien hisses] [alien hisses] [Vernon chokes] [screen beeps] Oh, my God. [alien growls] [screen beeps] [tense music] [alien growls] [dramatic music] [alien hisses] [Hannah grunts] [alien squeals] [alien hisses] [brooding music] Oh, shit. We got to get you out of here. No, you're not going to do that. It's bad. It's bad. Look. Stay strong, all right? Don't forget about the team. I won't. [brooding music] You know what? Cancer... it's a son of a bitch. [exhales] [helicopter chuffs] [enchanting orchestra music] [Solon] There we go. She's awake. Jesus Christ. That bad? Yeah. Sergeant Solon. That's right. You must have circled the city a dozen times. Are there any other survivors? Just him there. Got him wandering the streets. Damn near dead. I'm not dead. I'm alive. Only because we got you out in time. But I did make it. I'm alive. Where are we? Over the Arizona desert, we're out to Camp Navajo. So you know what happened, right? You know what happened to the city. Same thing happened in San Francisco... Seattle... most of the Western seaboard. I was in San Diego before I was... We found a few others on the radio. But you two are the only ones that have survived. Everyone else is gone. The government's considering an air strike, whether there's survivors or not. - An air strike, are you serious? - Yes. Come on, man. A nuclear war is not going to solve anything. So it really is the harvest. Yes. So you know about the legend? It's been classified for decades. Great. Anything else useful still classified? Like what? Like how we fight them? No. There's your weapon. [Solon] What is it? It's a form of blood cancer. Cancer? Yeah. Welcome to the resistance. [dramatic orchestra music] [helicopter roars] [upbeat music]
