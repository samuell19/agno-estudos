Run! Run! Run! All right, girl, there you are, there you are, girl. Come on! Come on! Get 'em up! Come on! Right, haul it up! Get them out! Come on! Hold on, Harry. Ted! Ted? Ted, it's Oliver Mellors. We're going to get you to hospital, Harry. Let's go! Go! Ted Bolton's in a bad way and Harry Dale's leg's a right state. Hurry up, lads! Come on. Ted. Hey, Ted. Ted, wake up, son. You keep your nose out, Mellors. I'll handle this. There you go. You daft thing... what am I to do now? You daft thing. Come on. Well done. Right, go on, off you go. Take it away. Come in now. Come on. Dance with us, Connie. Connie? Champagne, madam? How are you enjoying the evening? Everyone seems so desperate to appear joyful, one senses only their despair. Are you always so forthright? Always. Perhaps I shouldn't be. On the contrary, it's refreshing. I haven't seen you at Wragby before. No, it's my first time. I am up from town with my sister and our dear friend. I... But... But are you enjoying the evening? I am now. But, really, someone should do something about this awful din. Not on my account. What will the Chatterleys think? Clifford Chatterley. Constance Reid. Sorry, Duncan. In the presence of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, we have come together to witness the marriage of Clifford and Constance... to pray for God's blessing on them, to share their joy and to celebrate their love. I, Clifford Herbert Chatterley, take thee, Constance Frieda Stewart Reid, to my wedded wife... '..to have and to hold from this day forward.' Keeping moving! 'For better, for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness 'and in health, to love and to cherish till death us do part.' I, Constance Frieda Stewart Reid, take thee, Clifford Herbert Chatterley, to my wedded husband... '..to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, 'for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.' 'To love, cherish and to obey, till death us do part... '..according to God's holy ordinance and thereto I give thee my troth.' Advance! Aggh! Advance! Advance! Welcome home, darling. Thank you, darling. Welcome home, Sir Clifford. Hop to it, lads. Yes, sir. That's it. We've got you. Right, Charles. Thanks. What a wonderful effort you've all made. Thank you. Thank you. Naturally, we'll engage the best doctor in the land. I am told there's a first-rate fellow on Harley Street. Oh. He'll operate? He manages incurables. Oh. Clifford. But you look so well. I'm, er... I'm very tired. Perhaps you could ask Mrs Betts to turn down my bed. We'll talk later this evening. Yes. Yes, of course. Sir Clifford needs time, My Lady. Yes. Mmm. No! I release you from any obligation towards me. No! No! No! No! Help! No! Quickly, help! Aggh! Fetch help, quick. Leave us! Leave us! My poor darling, my poor darling. You'll always have me. You will always have me. Out of pity. Out of love. "My darling Bertha... "words cannot describe my joy that I shall live to see you again." Thank heaven, I thought the rain would never stop. Yes, milady Steady. Sir Clifford will see you now. Acquaint me with your gamekeeping experience. I worked the Shipley Hall Estate for two years before moving to Tevershall Pit. And for what reason did you move? I got wed, needed the better money. I were always well thought of at Shipley, if that's what you're alluding to. You were supplied with a written reference? You served? What regiment? The 1/7th. You served under me? One o' you, happen. One saw so many men come and go. We owe them a great deal, those of us who came home. And God rest their souls. You will be gamekeeper to the Wragby estate. Betts will meet you at six o'clock tomorrow morning at the gatehouse. Thank you, sir. The new gamekeeper, he served in my regiment. Oh. You remember the man? No. That's 25% throttle, Betts. That's 50% throttle, Betts. Be careful, Clifford! Isn't it the most marvellous machine?! Please, be careful with the throttle, Sir Clifford. Oh, Betts, sometimes you really are an old woman! That's 75% throttle, Betts, and rising. Here we go! Whoo-hoo! I never knew it was so beautiful. I haven't been able to get down here in so long. I spent the happiest days of my boyhood in this wood, and now I've set a man about restoring it to former glories. Mellors! Morning, sir. I see you've been busy with pest control. I'd say we were winning this war and all, sir. Constance, this is our new gamekeeper, Private Mellors of the 1/7th. Good morning, milady Good morning, Mellors. Mellors, gun. You'd better come along in case the machine sticks. Aye, sir. She's making fairer progress here than over no-man's-land, eh, Mellors? Thank heavens for that, sir. Gun. Well, she seems to be up to speed. Keep up the good work, Mellors. Ramming speed, sir. Quite. Milady Will that be all, Milady? Clear away those old papers would you, Mrs Betts? Very good, milady Good morning, Sir Clifford. Good morning, Mrs Betts. Oh! Aggh! Help! Someone help! Aggh! Aggh! Oh, my goodness, Milady, Sir Clifford. Aggh! Ow! No, don't fuss. Constance? Aggh! Oh, sir, are you safe? Aggh! I'm fine. Constance? Milady, you must rest. I must get Clifford his bath. Rest, Milady, it's all took care of. One hears accounts from elsewhere in the land of sedition on an alarming scale. Is there much bolshevism among the men? I don't see how you're going to get bolshevism, Sir Clifford, when all the lads want is just money to enjoy themselves. And the girls the same, with fine clothes. There was no time for discussion. You were incapacitated and Mrs Bolton's services were immediately available. I don't like her intimacy. Now you're being ridiculous. She's a servant. It's not as if she's a person. Do you like her attending to your physical needs? I would like to be as other men, able to stand on my own two feet. You know what I mean. I feel less... ashamed of accepting her menial offices. I don't regard them as menial. But I ought to be a figure of potency to you, Constance. In which regard, I will be visiting the colliery today. Oh. I've neglected my duty long enough. Thank you, Field. I should be at your side. And you are, in all things, but the colliery is no place for a lady. Begging your pardon, milady Mr Mellors is making quite the fuss about a key for the cottage. Mr Betts has gone with Sir Clifford and the boy is laid up with influenza. I could ask Mr Clifford if... Mellors can wait till morning. Very good, milady On second thoughts, Mrs Betts, I could do with some fresh air. I'll take my walk. It's barely out of my way. Very good, milady All right, all right, hold your horses! Lady Chatterley. I do hope I'm not disturbing you. I'm sorry I've not a coat on for Your Ladyship. I had no idea who were knocking. She is a suspicious one. She's only acting lady of the house. I do love dogs, don't you? They're too tame and clinging for my taste. Are you always in such a grim temper? I've been told I don't quite digest my bile. You requested a key for the cottage. My husband keeps the original and it's been difficult... I beg Your Ladyship's pardon, but I don't see it as asking too much to have a key to my own cottage. You misunderstand, it's been difficult to find anyone, so I've brought you a duplicate. You should never have gone to the trouble. I did take the trouble. I see now I shouldn't have bothered. No, no, Milady, I meant no disrespect. All I meant was that it wasn't important enough for you yourself to be put out over it. I'm very grateful to Your Ladyship. Well, then, all that was required was a simple word to that effect. It is essential the equipment is in full working order. We must increase productivity. Sir Clifford, I'll fetch a lad to climb up. Nonsense, man, I'll see for myself. Hup! Steady, Sir Clifford. Argh! Here I shall generate the power to drive a nation! Begging your pardon, milady. Field? From Mr Mellors, milady Thank you, Field. Very good, milady My apologies, milady Pipe down, you daft bitch! Your Ladyship will have to forgive her. I don't know where she gets her bad manners from. One struggles to even speculate. I wondered what the hammering was. Getting coops ready for young pheasants. And I'd come to the wood for some peace and quiet. Regarding your letter of apology, you walked so far to say so little. Least said, soonest mended, milady What if my husband had seen it? It were intended you didn't inform His Lordship and spare me the chop. You have a very low opinion of me, that I'd have you dismissed over a trifle. I've known men suffer fates far worse for as little. Really, your insolence appears so generalised, one chooses not to take it personally. What a beautiful place. I should like to come here and paint. Happen I can find another place for rearing pheasants. Whatever do you mean? It'll take me a couple of days to move all this stuff out. I don't want you to move anything out at all. I only fancied coming to paint here sometimes. I can sit perfectly well on this tree stump. Well, Your Ladyship can sit wherever she pleases, only Your Ladyship wouldn't want me tinkering around and about when your Ladyship were here. Why should I mind you being here? The nuisance of me. Clearly you mean the nuisance of me. Am I such a nuisance? I think it's best if I see to traps, Milady, and this can wait. Then I shan't bother you. You're my husband's gamekeeper, not mine. No, Milady, let's not have another misunderstanding. This is as much your place as Sir Clifford's. Your Ladyship can turn me off at a day's notice. It were only... Only what? Only that Your Ladyship would like the place to Your Ladyship's self, for peace and quiet, not me at my work, banging and the like! Why do you think I should take any notice of you and your being here or not? As if you could possibly be important, you and your stupid presence! Is there shelter nearby? Only the cottage, milady Well, quick, then. Warm yourself by the fire, milady You must warm yourself as well. I'm all right as I am. Why are you embarrassed? I ain't. Mellors... Please, Milady, if it became known we were here like this together, I'd lose more than my job. I think the shower's passed. Thank you for the shelter. Good day, Mellors. Good day, milady Darling. Thank you, darling... but it's no use. There are things we can still do. We've tried. The frustration is insufferable. There are things you can do... for me. I'm very tired. Goodnight, darling. I love you very much. I love you. I consider this land the heart of England. Mmm, yes. When I see it, I mind more not having a son than any other time. The land will last. But not the Chatterley name. I'm sorry we can't have a son. I haven't given up hope, Constance. Science possesses the answers to all man's ills. Ready. Again. Field, I thought I had made myself perfectly clear. I asked to be left alone. My apologies, milady Sir Clifford has asked me to inform you not to leave the house. In the event of fluid, Your Ladyship will be required immediately. Yes. Begging your pardon, Milady, but you've not eaten. I was worried you might catch cold. Thank you, Mrs Betts, that's most kind. Will that be all, Milady? Yes, yes. Very good, milady I order this obscenity to stop at once! You will leave this minute! Your equipment will be sent on. Ssh. That will be all, Bolton. Very good, milady I tried. Are there chicks? 36 so far. Not bad. Can I see? Pure, sparky, fearless new life. I'd love to touch one. Oooh! Yeah, reckon I'm a bit more thick-skinned. Hello. Reckon he's took you for his mother. Milady, I meant no... You don't appear a coward. There's things I rightfully fear. Are you afraid now? Yes. Of me? Not you. The world in you. Don't be. I'll walk no further. You aren't sorry, are you? No. What, then? I... I thought I'd done with it all. With what? Life. I do beg Your Ladyship's pardon, only I do love to see the flowers. Quite all right, Bolton. Very good, milady. The gardens will be a rare treat when full in bloom, milady. Hmm, they will. Tell me... is it many years since you lost your husband? Six this coming October, milady. Since they brought him home. May I ask? An explosion, down the pit. I'm very sorry. He looked so quiet when he was dead. As if he'd got free. He was such a nice-looking lad. It just broke my heart to see him so still and pure-looking, as... as if he'd wanted to die. But it was the pit. He didn't want to leave you. No, that was only my silly cry. And I kept expecting him back, especially at night. All I wanted was to feel him there with me. Warm. The touch of him. That's it, milady. The touch of him. I feel it to this day. How can a touch last so long... that you can still feel him after all these years? Oh, milady, it lasts. Once you've got a man in your blood. I search for it still, that touch. But it's only Ted I find. Only him. I thought you weren't coming back to me. Thought I were alone again. No, never. Never. I shan't take dessert, thank you, Field. Very good, milady. Sir Clifford and I would like to be alone for a while. Very good. Sir, milady. Something the matter, dear? It's our great sorrow, the absence of a child. It's my fault, this yearning I've stirred up in you, all my vain fault in raising the subject of siring an heir. It's not your fault at all. We agree, marriage is as much in the mind. Ours transcends the limitations of the body and is eternal. This is our life. Precisely. Sexual connections pass like the mating of birds. It's the living together from day to day, not the... sleeping together once or twice. Time goes on as the clock does. Half past one instead of half past 12. It's been some time since we've entertained. We should make amends. I should like to see my sister. Well, then, it's agreed. Thank you, darling. It was the most uneventful journey. That's your way of saying we live in an unfashionable corner of the land. Ah, but it appears that country living has agreed with you at last. Hmm. Perhaps that. Thank you, Travis. Thank you, Louisa. Perhaps not. Connie, do tell. I can't. You have a lover. Sssh! It's only to be expected. Hilda! I hear Clifford has become totally absorbed in coal mining. You can't expect that to be sufficient fire. Hilda. You haven't denied it. Promise not to tell. Cross your heart. You do. You do, who is it? Promise? I promise. You must swear not to tell a soul. Connie! Clifford's gamekeeper. Hilda, you should see your face! Oh, Connie, like an absolute ninny I believed every word! Reverend and Mrs Massey. Thank you... Captain and Mrs Hepburn. Mr Duncan Forbes. Sorry, excuse me. Duncan! Don't look so surprised, Connie, you did send me an invitation. Look at you! A quantity of my newly developed coal would yield more energy than the same quantity of a common or garden variety. One would hope as much as 20%. Squire Leslie Winton. It all works by developing a form of coal that burns at a higher temperature. My word, Clifford, didn't God make fire hot enough for you? It's fascinating. Isn't it fascinating, darling? Good evening, Squire Winton. How do you do? I trust all is well, sir? Yes, thank you. I think it might be time for me to retire. So early? I'm very tired, darling. But please don't feel you have to withdraw on my account. Goodnight, Hilda. Goodnight, Clifford. We must dance immediately, as I am no longer sober enough to stand. I always wondered why you chose Clifford. Chose him over you, you mean. Was it the title? Clifford wasn't a baronet when I fell for him, his late father was. You could have had any man, Constance. And I must have taken leave of my senses to marry the most dashing one of all. I hope circumstances don't force you into becoming a demivierge. No doubt water needn't be as wet as it is. It overdoes it, in wetness. But there it is. Begging your pardon, sir, milady, guests are rising. Duncan must have a heavy head this morning. Mr Forbes won't be joining us for breakfast. No? Duncan had to catch the first train home, pressing business engagement. We'll come through in a moment. Very good, sir. Er, it's the child that matters, isn't it, darling? Clifford? What I mean is... not the man so much? Don't worry, Clifford, I've understood your meaning exactly. Leave us! Shut the door. Constance, please, I... You plotted Duncan's invitation! I was thinking only of you. Of me?! Naturally! To save you the embarrassment of having to parade the sex thing like a continental. Perhaps you interviewed candidates? Sought references! Duncan was utterly innocent of the scheme. It's plainly obvious the poor chap adores you. He's good-looking, intelligent, well-bred. Naturally I assumed you'd regard him as the right sort. You regard him as the right sort. The deed has to be done by someone! You make it sound like pulling a tooth. I mean only that the man doesn't matter. Only the creation of our child. Clifford, you appal me that you would humiliate me thus! I crawl upon my belly, Lady Chatterley, to avert my eyes, while under my own roof another man would perform on my wife the act God has stolen from me! The humiliation is mine! I must have an heir! You have the nicest behind of any a woman. The nicest tail of any a lass. You've got a real soft, sloping bottom that a man loves in his guts. It's a bottom that could hold the world up. How lovely your hair is there. That's John Thomas's hair, not mine. Isn't he somehow lovely? So on his own and so... strange. He's got his root in my soul, he has. He's not only yours. He's mine too. I'll allow, there's worse jobs on this estate! Hey, you've got me in trouble again, yeah, but he's come up smiling. Speak up, lad, her ladyship can't hear thee. "Open the gates, milady, as John Thomas may come in." It was no-one, come back to bed. Won't folks be thinking summat, you coming here day and night? No-one knows. The lady of the manor can't come and go and people not notice. Really? I'd best not call you milady, then. Why would you? I'm Connie Reid from Tevershall village, born and bred. Happen you're a long way from home, Connie. First time at Statutes? I should welcome a guide to the attractions. Move your arse! Oh. The nerve! I should like to teach them some manners. On you go, then. You enjoyed that. It's how the other half live. Though I can't say it's enjoyable. But you're enjoying my being taught a lesson. Oh, there's a lesson in it, aye. You can either be Connie Reid of Tevershall village, or you can be Lady Chatterley. But you can't be both. Stand by, milady. Ah, step right up, sir. Someone's feeling strong. Argh! You fat bastards! Is it always like this? Nah, no, that were a quiet night. You've never had one before, have you? It's a sweet and a fruit. But I dare say there are those who've remarked it can't be both. Clifford, darling, I have good news. I'm expecting a child. You have made me the happiest man on earth. You're happy aren't you, darling? Very happy. Thank you, darling. And the man? You must rely on me to handle him with sensitivity and propriety. Of course. Where are we going, darling? To inspect the pheasantry. I want to hear Mellors' report on progress. We shouldn't disturb the birds. I'm sure they'll be fine. Coming, darling. Oh, dear, we're stuck. Mellors! I'll fetch help from Wragby. Please, don't. It's, er, such a way. Has she gone wrong, Sir Clifford? I'd say that was stating the obvious, wouldn't you? Well, there's nowt catching, far as I can tell. Then, would you give her a push, get her going? Sir. Ha-ha, see, she's doing it. Are you pushing? She won't do it without. I said only to set her going. Kindly let the machine do her work. Oh, for God's sake, Clifford! It is obvious that I'm at everybody's mercy. Well, I'll push too. In your condition? Don't be ridiculous. You mustn't, you'll hurt yourself. Please, Clifford, he'll hurt himself. Mellors. Can't you see he's intent on hurting himself? Let me run back to Wragby and fetch Betts and Travis and the boy. I'd rather not have the whole world entertained by my helplessness. Aye, sir, just a case of digging in for the big push. Yeah, yes, indeed. I'm most grateful. Clifford... The man says he's up to pushing. Do you want to kill him? Say it, damn you! Say you need help. Say it! Look, stand by, I'm going to throttle-up again. Ha-ha, she's doing it! Come along, Constance. I'm forever in your debt, Mellors. Oliver... Constance, darling, aren't you coming? Why would you allow such an abominable spectacle? The man was doing his duty by sparing his master's humiliation. Because your precious machine broke down! Would you have rather Betts, Travis and the whole world witness my helplessness? He made himself sick and you encouraged him. You should be ashamed. I am. Go home and send for a doctor. Oh, Lord, what has he done to you? I did it to myself. I'll not be babied, soon enough you'll have a real one for that. I wanted to tell you, but... I feared the baby would make for the end, I didn't, I didn't know what to do. Is that why you wanted me, then? To have a child? Did I seem of good enough stock, as you'd consider a horse for a stud? I felt for you what I've never felt. Heaven knows, it would have been simpler if you'd not been... Say it! Say it! Simpler if I'd not been a servant! To be commanded and Your Ladyship has commanded a lover and commanded a baby! I wanted you for you, for us! Us? I went down pit at 12. That's what your kind do to children, pack 'em off underground away from light and nature and good things. And dust choked my lungs, then for good measure they shipped me off to France, no doubt in the hope of finishing me off! All while you were away marrying for land and title. I married the man, not the land and title. Well, go back to him, then! Go and put your little baronet in Wragby. No. I want you. How can it be, woman? How can it be? It can't. It will never be. Constance, darling, please. Constance? Darling, please, let me in. I, I must come in. My darling, you have me out of my mind with worry... The baby. The baby is well. Then, then all is well. I do understand, my darling. Do you? It's quite clear to me that there has been some unseemliness involving the man you appointed. Just give me some time. Darling, we shouldn't delay a formal announcement. The longer we leave it, the greater the opportunity for speculation. Yes? Am I to turn down Her Ladyship's bed, Sir Clifford? Thank you, Mrs Betts, Lady Chatterley has retired for the rest of the day. Is it too early to ask if names have been considered yet? Far too early. If a boy... It will be. IF, then we favour Geoffrey, after my dear father. And his middle name would naturally be Malcolm, after my dear father-in-law. My apologies, sir. Thank you, Field. Hilda, come on! I hear great things concerning Sir Clifford's power station... Yes. By the end of the year, he's hoping to supply electricity to half the homes in the county. Please excuse me a short while. I have an urgent business matter. I hope this is indeed a matter of extreme importance. I found it in the gamekeeper's cottage. Constance Stewart Reid. They're Lady Chatterley's initials as was, aren't they? Yes. A Tevershall baby in the Wragby cradle. The scandal of it. What on earth do you mean? It's plain as day. Lady Chatterley's lover, and father to her child... is Oliver Mellors. How dare you bring this foul profanity into my house!? How dare I? Well, because I'm of the kind only to be used and discarded as your kind pleases! Get out of my way, please! My Ted, sent down the pit and killed there, working for the Chatterleys. Betts! Then them trying to make out it was his own fault, so their compensation was only 300 pound! But they wouldn't let me have the money down, so as I could start up a little shop or, or something of my own. They said no doubt I'd squander it, perhaps in drink! So I had to draw it 30 shilling a week, going every Monday morning, standing there a couple of hours waiting my turn. If you feel one shred of the humiliation I have felt... well, you'll have the punishment you deserve. Milady. Have you seen my husband? Sir Clifford required a breath of fresh air, milady. There you are. I was worried. The cataclysm has happened. We are among the ruins, the roof brought down. Of your making, Lady Chatterley. We've got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen. Clifford, I... Get away. Get away. Get away from me! The car will take you off the estate. The rest of your things will be sent on. May I have a moment in private, Betts? Yes, milady. Who told you? I asked you a question. I didn't need telling, it was brazen. You had your way. No doubt he served your purpose. What did Oliver Mellors say to you? Nothing. He's never said a word against you as long as he's lived. But, milady... you care for him? I love him. I love him. I love him with all my heart. Oh, milady, what have I done? What have I done, milady? I'm sorry. You must go to him quickly, before it's too late. Too late? Word travels fast. He'll have flit already, if he knows what's good for him. Oliver? Oliver? Oliver! I'd best be away low afore half of Nottinghamshire's down here with shotguns. I can protect you. How? If we're together. I've no Wragby to offer. But you've put a child into me. Be tender to it and that will mean much more than Wragby. I've a fear of putting children in the world. The world that's coming, this machine world with machine men. So you do want this to end? Everything ends. No. You've just given up! Wait! Connie, wait! Why? Why?! Why don't you believe in us? I do. Do you? You never said it. I've said it an 'undred times inside you. I need to hear it! But you want the talk after that makes it all to be something grand and mysterious. It is. At least to me. This, this rare and... sacred and fragile thing that we are. I want to be with you. I want to be with you in heart and belly and cock. It heals it all up that I can go into you. And I love you for opening to me, in my bed... wider than you ever thought you would. And that's the truth of the world, to me. You took two vows, Lady Chatterley. The first of marriage, the second to conceive an heir and not let it come between us. Life has turned a new face on it all. And for what do you want to go back on everything? Love. It is as bitter as death to me to have the order of life smashed, just for some feeling of yours. I know better than to seek understanding. I seek only divorce. You, do you mean to say that you would marry him? Yes. Bring him to me. Clifford... Bring him to me! You have broken the holy order of things as certainly as if she'd lain with an ape. You ought to be wiped off the face of the earth. Your so-called ruling class is the mingiest set of ladylike snipe ever invented. A generation of fops and cowards with half a ball each. You lost yours in France, man, at least you got out with your life, unlike most you ordered into the teeth of the enemy. We were more likely to fall in battle than the ordinary man. England's finest sons, her future rulers, gone. And, and who takes their place? Ha, you?! Your offspring?! Me and my sort, aye. You've not even the guts to remember me. Remember you? When you were laying wounded and I stood over you. And the look I saw in your eyes then is very like the one I see now. You long for the mortal wound, for someone to put you out of your misery. You fear life more than you fear death. What would you know? I would know. You will collect what's owing to you and vacate my property at once. As for you, Lady Chatterley... your child will never be better than a bastard. Grant the divorce or God help me, I'll... Oliver, please. Please. Once, to unburden me of you... you were ready to sacrifice your life. I believe there must still be a part of the beautiful man I fell in love with capable of one last act of sacrifice. Have your divorce, Lady Chatterley. Have it. Take her, she's yours. And mine? Mine is the world.
