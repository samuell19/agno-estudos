"Every year, around the world and even here, " “thousands of young women disappear. " “Perhaps If they had been more aware of the fearsome hicks employed by the traffickers, " “some women would not have fallen into their sordid traps. " “Only by revealing the tactics of the bandits" "will It be possible to provoke their failure?' “by showing without pointless hypocrisy how the most odious constraints are exercised, " “through sophisticated approaches, followed by dramatic violence. " "Hiding the truth would mean hiding the seriousness of the danger" "and thus remain defenseless against the most despicable of traffics. “ Come on, go ahead. WOMEN DISAPPEAR Why not shooting fireworks while you're at it? - You're still going out? - Hush. - It's the second time this week. - Gimme my shoe. Your father knows about this? Where are you going? - It's my business only. - It's mine too, don't you think? - Pierre... - I can't stand knowing you're alone out there. Not knowing where you are and with whom you are. You have no reason to be jealous, I assure you. - Let me come with you then. - Not tonight. - Béatrice... - Listen, Pierre. I want to go out alone, it's my right. You're not my husband yet. That's enough Pierre. You must leave me alone now. I'm tired of you treating me like a kid. It's only a girls' night out. It's not a crime. That girl The day I will make her wedding dress, she will probably come and try it after the wedding. Gee, they don't fit! Young lady, evening shoes must be worn very tight - At last! - I'm sorry Madame - but It's always the same at home. - Sure, sure. You're lucky that I'm late. These girls will make me die. - I was afraid you wouldn't come. - Don't talk nonsense. - You know Thérése? - Good evening. - Béatrice. - Good evening. It would help If we could get that cat out of the picture. Firm and fast. - But without excess. Got It? - Yeah. Could you repeat what you said earlier? What, are you crazy? You guys never stop arguing! - Hands off. - Dirty little brat! Stop it! I don't get It, I was just passing by and this guy suddenly jumped at mo. Calm down and hand me your papers, quick! - You got a job? - Of course. We're sorry, sir. You want to lodge a complaint? No, let him go. Come on, go home. - Good night sir. - Good evening, sirs. The little prick! You could have him put in jail. What came over you? I want him to remember me. Little scumbag! No need to play play so rough, mate. You'd better give me his wallet. This way It will look like an honest little "mugging". - So? - I almost look like a lady. Wait a little. You think It's really necessary? I don't want to keep Cora waiting. She wouldn't be the first to wait in my studio. Fréhel, Damia, even that hothead of Mistinguette. Well, they all had lo wail their turn. So It's surely not Cora who will make me shiver. Where's that damn needle? - That's what you're looking for? - Thanks. Coraline has made a brilliant marriage. Good for her. She shops now at fashion designers. Very well. Nevertheless, It's me who made her communion dress. All the same, at our sewing room, we have customers much less impatient than Coraline. - Where ls It? - In the Carton lounge. What's certain Is that she stayed the same after her marriage. I find her as nice as before. It's true. She could have invited society ladies instead of us. - You like It like that? - It's wonderful. It's her. If you could see her car. The worst thing In the world after stupidity is clumsiness, my dear Nasol. To prevent that fool from being busted was really clumsy. And to risk sending him to the morgue after the cops separated you was completely unwise. Unwise? That's rich coming from you. Keep your advices for yourself. What about your recent "operations" on my turf? You find that careful? Didn't you get your share on each of these "operations"? That's nut the point. At this rate, there shall be soon no street where you haven't snatched a girl. That's what I call being unwise. Really unwise. What are you driving at? It's over, Victor. We must stop before the oops understand. After, it will be too late. Too late for what, Nasol? You don't care If the cops tear us apart, huh? "Victor Qualio? Who is Victor Qualio?" “He's unknown on this turf. " "But Nasol, we know him. " "We'll present him with the bill. " Victor, I'm warning you. Tonight's operation is the last one. Does this mean that you want to deprive us of your collaboration? Yes. And operations like that on my turf are over. My word! We raise our voice now. We give orders. We're not afraid of the big bad wolf anymore. We become courageous. You're not playing at home, you seem to forget that too often. I pay well enough the right to say and do what I like. You can't buy everything, Victor. From now on, you'll need my authorization too. - “Signed Nasol“. - That's right. Nasol, the purse snatcher. The boozers' robber. Nasol, the champ of the break-in in maid': rooms. Nasol, the loser. MY qoodnes! Very good. That rug is so fragile. - That little street we talked about, It's discreet enough? - Not a single rat. Then move him there. And that brick he wanted to use to smash that little punk? There's still a chance I can use it. Seize it. And don't forget to leave this hanging nearby. When committing his first murder, that poor young man had the misfortune of losing his wallet. And don't forget to recover your chewing-gum. It has no chance to serve again but it would attract attention. - You're crazy! - I know Béatrice is here. Now you see there's nobody here. - But you're hurt, my poor boy! - No, it's nothing. - What about this? - It's a dress. It's Béatrice's dress. Why did she leave it here? To wear the one I just made her instead. Oh, I'm sorry. Wait, I'm going to fix your face. Here's to refresh yourself a little. Who has messed you up so badly? I'd like to know too. If I still had my wallet, I would have said a guy who had a meeting with Béatrice. You should be ashamed of yourself thinking things like that. Don't you think it's curious that a car following her all evening finally tries to run over me. And to top It all, one of the guys got out of the car and tried to break my face. So now there are two of them? Come on, kiddo... Say, you really don't know where Béatrice went? I swear to you. She just talked with other girls and then they left. I think you shouldn't worry too much about this. From what I heard, they just had the intention to go out and dance. Well, my dear lawyer, you're quite dashing! Not bad, huh? It cost me an arm. Cigarette? He makes no progress. You think they can read music? No, but with your luck you can bet some of them will be music lovers. I see here someone who's not very confident in your talent. Right, Lambert? You can't be too careful. - Where's Merlin? - Not here yet. Nothing special tonight, gentlemen. The usual routine. Just try to avoid changing partners. It's a waste of time. Of course, I want you all to be ﬂawless. I'm willing to forgive Pasquier’s wrong notes but under no circumstances I will forgive Lambert’s clumsiness. Just in case, I remind you that hand-kissing for young girls is contrary to common practice. One of them might know this detail. Be tactful and show ﬂexibility in general. Don't forget the kind of characters you're supposed to personify. Well, down to the real business now. Pasquier. Norbert Pasquier, fashion designer. I'm shipping out tomorrow for the Middle East where I'll show my winter collection. And obviously a young model as extra baggage would be very handy. That's very good. Maybe my friend Féllcien could accompany me with his new secretary? Under what pretext? Cotton purchases for my mills. I'm a textile manufacturer. No, gentlemen. No more "shipment" toward the Middle East. Flight pursers are becoming more curious about young female passengers. A recent Interpol circular recommended them to be on the lookout. I have a copy on my desk. No. No unnecessary risk. I will add that every girl has to keep the belief that she has a unique opportunity. A personnel opportunity. Well, how can I put this? Think "Sleeping beauty" rather than "Embarkation for Cythera". Each of you tonight is a potential prince charming. - Yeah, great, great... - Lambert! Pierre Lambert, Champagne maker from Epernay. “People In ministries only drink Champagne Lambert. " “Lambert, Champagne of the Republic. " Decidedly you will never forget your beginnings as a street hawker. How about a little discretion, huh? And your work will be much more effective. - Your turn, Delacour. - Maitre Delacour. Lawyer of the Advocacy of Paris. High society divorces. A lawyer? You're kidding me, right? With a wrinkled little face like yours. Give up the Idea of going to the other side of the barricade. Tonight you will be Doctor Delacour. Plastic surgery, clinics In the world's best cities. - You see what I mean? - Very well. - Only princely noses. - Perfect. Also, I remind you that all our guests can easily be seduced by the lure of a new, easy, pleasant and fruitful career that ls going to get them out of their mediocre lives and that In no way they must have the feeling you are proposing yourself as a rich guardian. We are dealing with honest girls. Let's never forget this. One last thing. No personal selection. Let freely play the inclinations of these young people. It is the least we can give them. I... I'm sorry. Car trouble? Bad luck at the game? Come on, Mr Merlin! It... It will never happen again. That's fine! We would be sorry to lose Coraline': husband in our team. - Be careful! - Oh, that girl! It's wonderful. Hardly feels like we're driving at all. I have It for two weeks. This is the first issued in France. You're so lucky. - You know, It's a bit of a liability for my husband. - A liability? Yes, in his profession he cannot afford to have an old-fashioned car. It's part of his social standing. - We'll see your husband tonight? - I hope so. What does he look like? You want to know if he's handsome? No, only If he's not too imposing or too important. We don't want to look stupid in front of him. - And the others? - Don't worry. You'll see. Everyone will be very, very nice. There we are, buddy. You're okay? Where the fuck did I put this damn brick? Well I never... What are you going to serve to our charming guests? Punch with a hint of cinnamon. It's still the best cocktail to support our little "seasoning". Above all, serve it light. And earlier than usual. I don't want the party to go out of hand. I hate when that happens. - There come the broads! - Really, Mr Lambert, it ls diff cult to count on you. You're too kind, sir. Victor Quaglio, our host. My friend Béatrice. Thanks for your presence, Miss. I hope you won't get bored with us. - And this ls my husband. - Miss. It has been a long time since I wanted to meet you. An enticing selection. - Pleased to meet you. - I didn't know you were on the French Riviera, Doctor. - Madame. - Good evening. My congratulations. What a beautiful bracelet! - 2 years of marriage, It counts. - I'd even say it adds up. Excuse mo. His husband ls doing well with his cars. This kind of trinket must cost at least 100.000 francs. - You mean It's a real one? - I can guarantee you that I've never robbed, er, seen one of such value. Thank you. No thanks, I can't stand Champagne. You'll hurt poor Lambert’s feelings, my dear. This bottle comes straight from his caves. - And he's very proud of them. - In that case. That Lambert, what a bore with his Champagne. Because he sells the best, he sends two boxes each time he's invited. I admit it is very good though. - It's you the fashion designer? - No, it's not mo. It's Norbert Pasquier, the tall guy there. I'm in the textile industry. Sorry. All change! Some punch, sir? Camille is doing the best. Hoarder! Tell me, I have not yet had the opportunity to thank you for the young girl you recommended me. - What girl? - Nadine Martin. Yes, I remember now. - Are you satisfied with her? - Satisfied? She's simply extraordinary. I put her to the test at 60.000 a month. She now earns 100.000 and I'm still winning. You see, that girl I had before... My dear Carette, I'm sorry, but her dance card is full. AI her dances are mine. Forgive me, I'm a bit of a selfish person. Excuse me, please. I have to leave you alone a few minutes. Coral You're not feeling well? I'm fine. Excuse ma. - Tom ls outside. - And then? - He comes for whom? - Neither you nor me, I suppose, so forget him. You didn't believe me either the last time I warned you. You had to see the "result" to believe me. Listen Georges, I agreed to do a certain job but I don't want to be mixed In some bloody business again. Just shut up. And take care of your friend. You'll have to take care of her yourself. I'm sorry for him but there is no other solution. Yeah... obviously. Problem ls, at this late hour, I don't have time for a clean job. Come on, you can't tell me tales. In any case, I'll need your garage to "anesthetize" him. The solution would be to leave him In a place frequented by Nasol's friends. You must leave, quickly! Don't be selfish. I'm expecting this dance since the beginning of the evening. I do not see our lovely Coraline. I saw her heading towards the terrace. Probably to get some fresh air. You couldn't stay quiet, huh? Pretty girls are not lacking in this city. But you had to develop a fixation with that one. You should have understood after the warning we gave you. But you refused to understand. First you saw me killing that moron of Nasol. Then you managed to come here on your own. But here you're just a nuisance to us. Where the fuck did I put the adhesive tape? There it is. Adhesive tape ls great to stay anonymous. Provided that you apply It with gloves to avoid fingerprints. Does It bother you that I speak to you? We're not a bunch of savages, you know. I have nothing against you, I'm just doing my job. I even think I've been pretty nice to you tonight. I stopped the guy who beat you to split your head open and a little later I cleared It up for you by killing him. Notice that, no matter what, you couldn't get out of this. You know why? I'm going to tell you. Your wallet has been placed under Nasol': head. Making you his official murderer. You follow ma? And tomorrow, when the cops find you as dead as him, they'll probably think that some of his gangster friends have killed you. That's it Come on, handsome! What the fuck is this? Say, that's a neat trick... So now we ran Into a regular magician! You'll have to explain this to me. Well, that's not very kind from you... Is this your good deed or you just fell In love with the guy? Let's go upstairs. She'll have to explain this. Come on! It's not your lucky day. What were you thinking? Spill the beans! What's wrong with you? You think the situation ls not complicated enough! You want to compromise us? Come on, tell me! Spit It out! Tell me! I beg you, Georges, not this! Take off your dress. Georges... You know how much it costs. Take it off! Georges! What were you thinking? Come on, spill it! Stop, Georges, stop! Come on, speak! Speak! Another trick of that little punk. Where is Béatrice? I beg you to leave. They mustn't see you near me. You tried to help me earlier. At least, answer my question - ls Béatrice downstairs? - Yes. - We're gonna stay up all night long? - Certainly not! Make up your mind then. What do you want exactly? Béatrice. And that car to get her out of here. Make the slightest move to stop me and I'll shoot. Oh, oh! Okay... But you see, it's not up to mo. - I'll try. - No! - How do you want me to do then? - The telephone. - Hurry up! - Coming, coming... Hello? Yes, it's mo. Could you ask Sir to have the extreme kindness to come to the phone? - It's urgent. - Are you crazy? - What's wrong with you? - Hurry up, I'm serious. Alright but you take full responsibility for this. Hang on. I'm sorry but Sir is urgently asked on the telephone. It won't take long. Wait for me please. I have yet many things to tell you. Yes, absolutely. This gentleman would be very grateful to us if we could bring him that young person. He wants to leave with her. Furthermore, he would like to borrow us the car for this little trip. Well, you see, given his insistence, I do not think we can deny him anything. Alright, I'm coming. That fool of Merlin let himself be disarmed. No girls on the terrace. Turn the music loud and rush to close the gate. A very troublesome thing happened, Miss. A young man who pretends to be your boyfriend forced his way into my house. He's armed and holds our friend Merlin at gunpoint. - It's unbelievable! - That's my opinion. As I do not want a scandal in my house, you will ask him to clear off quickly. You can count on me. Nothing gives him this right. This way please. May I ask, young man, the reason for this scandal? Cut the crap and hands up! - You too, the killer. - The killer'? Yep... and he's blabbering like that for a while now. Sir should do like me to be on the safe side. Pierre, you're going to leave this house immediately! Don't stand in front of him, stupid, or he will kill the both of us! What's wrong with you, Pierre? You have no right! That's my opinion too. That's why I would be very grateful to you If you could bring this young man to a more reasonable perspective. - Filthy scumbag! - Pierre! Shut up, stupid, and get in that car! - I don't know what to do... - Get in the car, for Christ sake! Or I swear I'm going to kill them all. And I'll start with this human wreck. I beg you, Miss, obey him. This comedy has lasted long enough. Please get us rid of this madman. Leave with him. Hands up, you tool And stay close to the others. Close your door. Turn on the ignition. Start the car. Open this door. Face the wall now. A single move and I kill the three of you. Hands higher up. Not here. Rush to the gate. See you there. A banker, a diamond seller, a fashion designer... You still haven't understood? - You're completely crazy. - Look in front of you and say it again. - Give me the key, quickly! - What key? If he moves, shoot him. Come, come. I won't tell you twice, you know. I probably hit him, he fell over there. Good. A 40 meters fall and hard rocks on the arrival. Try to find him. I wouldn't like people to make a grisly discovery at the base of the property. It's a quiet home here. What a night! I'm not sure I enjoy your little artistic experiences on Coraline': skin. Remember that before being your wife, Coraline is our associate first. If a punishment ls Imposed to her, it must be on my order and not, In any case, for your personal enjoyment. I know what Coraline tried to do. She'll have to explain later. Meanwhile, go help Tom in his search. In your Interest, try to behave properly. Well... Don't be afraid. So, Cora, what's going on with you? A small crisis of conscience? I have a remedy for that. I advise you to remember it. We'll talk about that tomorrow. For the moment, go back to your guests. They need your presence. We pout? We don't like what we've seen? I can act very differently when I meet a superior woman like you. Don't touch me, you're disgusting. Too bad for you, kid. I would have thought you more intelligent. Give me a favor. Lock the little Miss in the Directoire room. She badly needs to think. Turn out your light, fool. We don't need the attention. He must be in there. Or else he took the swan dive. - I'll have a look. - I'm coming with you. What for? I see, you're afraid of the dark. You need to be led by the hand. It's just that we'll make a better search if we are two. Cut the crap, please! There's no need for you to be scared to dead. He's unharmed. And watch your step, If you don't want to take the plunge too. Open the door! Thanks. How did it go? Quietly. We leave in the morning. You'll find the little Béatrice in the Directoire room. I don't think I'm his type. I have no doubt that you will have more success than me. At least, tell me what I'm supposed to do. I'm telling you again, I don't know. This is about your future, not mine. I am not here to give you advices. Really? I would have thought the opposite was true. You got a cigarette? Everything': alright? Say, this is very nice... Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Pierre! Will you shut up! - What's wrong with here? - Nervous breakdown. And not a small one. Camille's stupid drug again. One day there will be a catastrophe. He always puts too much of it. Last month already, the little brunette almost died. You remember? It started exactly the same. - I'm going to see Victor. - No, I'll tell him. Take care of her. Will you shut up for a minute? Get out, quick. Victor, the little Jacqueline... It's just a nervous breakdown. We can'! have this turning into a syncope like the other day. Victor, I swear... it's urgent. Quick! I'll buy you dresses on the way. Tons of them. I want you to be the most beautiful woman of the cruise. All the same! - What will they say at my work? - Don't worry, we'll settle everything. Coraline will call your boss. And you'll send postcards to your colleagues while ashore. Athens, Naples, Alexandria... I can already see their faces. They will be mad with jealousy. Now that's smart! I swear! You're a real help, pal. Well, come on, we'll go for a stroll. You're a little bit too showy here. Come here, old buddy. What a night, I swear! That's it Pierre, we should really go to the police. Excellent Idea. Let me recover my wallet first. Cops are already there. What now? Let's get your dress. You can't stay half-naked. But I'm telling you that I can't! It's true, I always forget that business with your wallet. What if I called the cops myself? An anonymous tip of course. I could explain everything. - If you don't tell them how you're In the know, they won't believe you. - You're right. What if I talked only about Béatrice? Saying that she wants to testify. - There's no risk for you. - Not a single one. And I'm pretty sure I can lead them to the villa. - I'll get right on It. - Above all, don't talk about Pierre. Don't worry. Have the others come downstairs. The cops could be here in ten minutes. What about the girls? Leave them alone. I don't want a single room locked. In the criminal code, it means sequestration. You take Coraline with you. Carol, you go first by the way on top. Meet you all at Paul's in one week. Hello? Bianey, take Martin with you and go get me this guy. Above all, don't show him his wallet. Thomas, stay here with Morin. I leave you here with three policemen and one brigadier. Take the bystanders' identities. Justin case. You promised you wouldn't talk about Pierre. Well, my poor darling, It's not me who talked about him first. It's them. As soon as I pronounced your name, and I couldn't do otherwise, they started to ask me: "What about her boyfriend named Pierre?" "Haven't you seen him by any chance?" I played dumb and answered that I didn't know him. But they kept at it and asked me to tell you that, in case you knew about Pierre's whereabouts, you had to make your best to have him come with you to the precinct. You will do as you like but in your place, considering that they woke the Inspector up, - I would go there. - You're probably right. Good bye, madam. And thanks for everything. Excuse us to have you involved in this story. Don't mention It. Good bye, kiddos. Good bye, madam. Good night. Either you resign yourself to see your boyfriend killed in front of you or you put your ass in that car pronto. Come on, quick. Why are you waiting so long to kill me? Don't push me too much or I will easily yield to your wish. Come on, get In the car. And no sudden moves. You like driving so much. You're going to do it one last time. - Where to? - To the villa, my friend. You know the way, don't you? I'm tired at this late hour. Come on. Start the car, kid. Take a left, it's a short cut. I told you to go left! - What If we talked seriously now? - I have nothing to say to you. I thought you had understood the stupidity of your behavior. I can do a great deal for you, Béatrice. A great deal, If you decide to change your attitude. - You're despicable. - Don't start again. I have nothing but contempt for you and I'm no longer afraid of you. I'm afraid you'll have to change your point of view. What a night! You got it all wrong, Béatrice. The cops you were waiting for won't come. And for good reason. You're going to have to be reasonable. Very reasonable. Look alter her. This way. - Victor, what do we do? - Let's vamoose with the cash. Turn around! Turn around! You hear ma? You want to kill me because your friends are getting killed by my friends. Bu! I want to share my death with you. It's cute, isn't it? You're fucking crazy! Some innocents girls are in this house! You really want to kill them, right? Take him away. Go away, I 599 W"- Come, it's time to go. So you bring the cops with you now. You don't seem very happy to see me. I'd rather have seen you alone. And you're probably going to sermon me about my clumsiness. Don't take me for another Nasol, please. Because, unless I commit suicide, you have no one left to do your dirty work. Is that what you really think? You had the chance to get out of their paws. Why did you come back? I came back for this. Look out, Pierre! Victor! It's the end of the party. Sir leaves us already? Either you take me with you or I kill you like a rat. I still have the strength, you know. I don't take anyone, especially not you. You got a face that cops are unlikely to forget. Scumbag! I know people who have died for less. I know. Only It was me wacking them for you. Turns out I can do it too. That's where I started. One for your clumsiness. One for your imprudence. And three others for pleasure.
