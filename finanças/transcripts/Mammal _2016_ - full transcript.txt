[blowing bubbles] [ladies talking indistinctly] [indistinct chatter] [woman] Hi, Margaret. [Margaret] I've another load for you. Ah, brilliant. Billy's is there. Ah, God, it's great, isn't it? Thanks, Margaret. No problem. Of course, he'll think his Mammy's only great now. [laughs] Hiya, look what I have for you. - Hiya. - [woman] Hey. Everything okay this morning? Yeah, good. Managed to get most of that new stock sorted. Great. Oh, and some man called for you. Did he leave a number? No, he just hung up when I said you weren't here. Is it okay if I head off now? I've to go to a lecture. - No problem. - Great. Thank you. [doorbell chiming] [door closes] [keys jangling] [phone beeps] You have one new message. [man] Hello, Margaret. It's me. It's Matt. It is you, isn't it? You changed your name back. Call me back, will you? I'm on the same number. [call disconnects] [phone beeps] [keys jiggles] [window shutting] - Is it okay if put this up? - Yeah, go ahead. You look different. Sorry, I didn't get to call you back. [Matt clicks tongue] I wasn't sure if you were still around here so... [waitress] Two coffees. Milk's there. Has something happened? Yes, something has happened. Look, I didn't want to come, but... they said it was worth checking with you just in case. He's been gone for two weeks. The Gardai say they're doing everything they can. I told them you left when he was a baby, that... he wouldn't have come looking for you. We never talked about you. He never even asked about you. I wasn't so bad, was I? I never asked you to understand. No. Of course. So, you haven't seen him then? No, I haven't seen him. Would you know him if you had? I haven't seen him. [Matt smirks] Right, well, I've done what I said I would. I won't take up any more of your time. What should I do if he... [footsteps] [door closes] [siren blaring in distance] [siren continues] [siren stops] Are you all right? Are you okay? Can you get up? [boy] I'm okay. [Margaret] Can you walk? [boy coughs] [retching and coughing] [boy grunts] [water falling] [tap closes] [water dripping] [inhales sharply] I'm going to get you a glass of water. Don't fall asleep. [water gushing] [meowing] You're cute. Ow. Little scamp. [cat meows] [kittens meowing] [phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] [answering machine beep] [automated voice] You have reached the voice-mail of: [Margaret's voice] Margaret Brady. [automated voice] Please leave a message after the beep. [phone beeps] [Matt] Margaret? [upset] They found Patrick. In the canal. [exhales] [Matt sighing] [sobbing] Margaret? I don't want any trouble at the funeral. Yes. [Matt] You're not to come. Mm-hmm. Do you hear me? Yes, I heard you. [disconnecting dial-tone] [doorbell chiming] [woman] Why didn't you tell me Andrew moved out? [rattling] Bitch! [dryer blowing] [indistinct chatter] Hi. Do you not remember me? What do you want? How's your hand? - It's all right. - Oh, good. That's great. - Look, I've to go. - Can I see it? Just to make sure that it's healing okay. You should really try to keep it dry. Does it hurt? No, it's okay. It's looking better, anyway. What do you want? I want to make sure you're looking after that hand. [scoffs] Where are you staying? Have you got somewhere to stay? What's it to you? I've got a spare room in my house. I'm looking for a lodger, but you can have it if you want until I find someone. It'd just be temporary. It's up to you. Come on through. The television's here, the remotes are in there. Kitchen's through here, help yourself to anything in the fridge. Um, you can leave your washing down there. I'll show you the room. This is it. The bed's old, but it's comfortable. I'll get some sheets. [kittens meowing] [talking in distance] [unzipping] What was that about? I hate cats. They're just hungry. No one looks after them. There's more there if you want it. No, I've had enough. They should be dry in the morning. I'm going to bed. Make yourself at home. [footsteps] [unlocking door] [tap closes] [tap opens] [door opens] [woman] Margaret Brady? [Margaret] Yes. [woman] I'm glad I caught you. Hi. My name's Jean Cunningham. I'm from the Child and Family Agency. What's this about? I'm your neighbor, Lucinda Byrne's, family support worker. I don't really know her. Right. But her former partner, Andrew Jordan, used to live here, with you? Yes, he was my lodger. Look, I'm sure you can imagine, it's not easy for her on her own. As the baby's father, he should be paying child support, at least. I'm sorry, I don't know where he is. But the car, the Toyota Carina parked on the street, is his? It's my car. I bought it off him before he took off. Are those bottoms dry? Yeah, they're on the radiator in the dining room. Mine's the same. They want everything done. Okay. I'll let you get on. Thanks for your time. Bye. Bye. Thanks. No worries. He left it to me, for rent. You want one? Yeah, all right. She thought I was your son. [laughs] I don't have sugar. That's all right. Do you know much about cars? A bit. Why? I could do with someone having a look at that car. I can't get it started. The keys are there. Thanks. See ya. 21.75. Do you need a bag? [softly] Sorry, how much? 21.75. - Do you need a bag? - Yes. [rummaging] With you in a minute. [groceries fall] [distant electro music playing] [music gets louder] - Do you mind? - No. Just don't smoke it in the house. Do you want some? [bottle cap clicks open] [bottles clinking] Oh, thanks. - You sure? - No, you're all right. It's good shit. Go on then. It's been a while. I knew you were all right. [cats meowing] There's your old mates, at it again. Mangy little bastards. And then they go drop their litters all over the place. It's all they know. I used to do that when I was a kid. My mum would brush my hair, almost pulled my head off. It distracted me from the pain. - Why do you do it then? - I don't know. I always did it. Sorry, I'm being weird. [cats meowing] [imitates meowing] [both laughing] [imitates meowing] [Margaret] My sisters and I used to do this when we were kids. It's so relaxing. [Joe laughs] [Margaret] Mm-hmm. [Margaret] No, lightly. Yeah. What about you? Do you have brothers and sisters? [Joe] Three half-brothers. [Margaret] Where are they now? [Joe] At home with me mum. [Margaret] And why aren't you with them then? It got a bit crowded. [sniggers] What? I was just thinking... [laughing] Do you like swimming? Yeah. Why? It's just you're not very good at it. [imitates laughing] [Margaret laughing] Hmm. I'm going to bed. 'Night. - Hi. - Hi. - You ready then? - Yeah. [Margaret] Okay. Stretch your arms out in front of you, keep your hands flat, palms down. Head down. Blow some bubbles down here into the water. [Margaret laughing] Good. Push your hand down, feel the water, and push it behind you. Yeah. Don't look at me. Continue the movement in a semicircle, elbows high and then, slide it into the water. That's this. Begin the movement again. Arm up high and then slide it forward. This... Yeah, and then up high and down. Elbow high. [Margaret smirks] And... That's it, okay. Now, lean into it. Make yourself flat, relax your body. Keep your body flat and relax, and bring your legs up and start to kick. And kick. Kick! Kick! Kick! Keep breathing. Kick. Keep breathing. [coughing] - Are you okay? - No. Joe, come on, come on. Come on, put me down. Put me down. [gasps and yelps] [Joe laughing] [Margaret laughing] [blows whistle] [guard] There's no splashing. Fuck off, you. [people exclaim] - Hey. - What? What next? That's enough for today. I'll see you later. Heya. Hi. You still like to swim, then? Yeah. What are you doing here? Did you not get my message, no? Look, I've got to get on... My hotel's only down the road, I thought we could go there for a drink, huh? [smirks] I mean, it's not too much to ask, is it? After everything? No. You'll catch your death, going around with wet hair, like that. Here, give me that. [indistinct chatter] [softly] Matt, don't. [Matt sighs] [Matt sobbing softly] [footsteps] [boy] Where are you going, you little cunt? Where are you going? [boys teasing] [punch] Who are you following? You little prick. Go on ride me, you little cunt. Go on ride me, you little prick. You little cunt. Come on. Yeah, that's right. Get the fuck down there, you little prick. Go on, Joe. Go on. Knock him out. Knock him out, Joe. Come on, Joe. [grunts] Oh! It's enough! It's enough! You fucking faggot! [engine starting] [engine stops] [front door closes] - Hiya. - All right. You got it going then? Do you want to go on a drive? Okay. Oh, God. [laughs] You're all right. You're all right. [both laugh] [slow instrumental music playing] [indistinct audio] How long? I don't know. A couple of minutes maybe. - How many minutes? - I don't know, one or two. I swim a lot. I used to teach when I was younger. - Yeah, who taught you then? - My dad threw me in. - You're messing. - Mm-mmm. He did it to all of us. Sink or swim, you know? "You know?" [chuckles] I like the way you talk. Look at them. [both giggling] [engine stops] [water flowing] Have you been up here before? No. Are you sure? - Drinking maybe? - No. Parking? No. You never came up here with a fella? Like those two back there? [chuckles softly] You're not going in? - Of course I am. - It's freezing! Come on! Don't be afraid. You're crazy! [chuckles] Come on! Come on! Come on! [Margaret] Oh. [Margaret screams] Come on! [Margaret] Oh. [Joe] Come on, you and your two minutes in. Prove it. [exhaling deeply] [laughing] [Margaret] Okay. [inhales deeply] - What the fuck! Fuck. - [breathing heavily] Stay, stay. Fucking hell. [gasping for breath] Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Stay, stay. I have you. I've got you. Fuck. [both chuckle] Okay. Fucking hell. We used to come up here on the mitch from school. [chuckles] There was this game we used to play. You have to hold your breath, while you're pushed up against a tree over and over again. Then you black out. Why would you do that? I don't know. It felt good before it went black. You just forget everything. If you started panting now, it'd happen. We did some fucked up things. [car door opens] What about your mum, then? What about her? Does she know where you are? No. Isn't she looking for you? Nah, I doubt it. [hand break] You all right to drive home, yeah? Yeah, of course. [Joe] Boys. [indistinct chatter] [car door closes] [car slowly accelerates] Bye. [doorbell chiming] [sighs] I don't know what to do with it all. Thought I'd put it to some good use. I can't stand being at home. I keep thinking it's something I did. We went there last year to celebrate his exam results. It helps being around you. Although sometimes, I could smash your skull in. Anyway, I'll leave those with you. [door opens] [door closes] [keys dropping] [knocking at door] [Joe] Yeah. Sorry, I thought you were up. No, it's all right. Come in. Late night? Yeah. Your cats were at it again, randy little bastards. I couldn't sleep. These were left in at the shop. See if there's anything you like. Which ones do you like? What do you think? It looks good. Here. I'm sorry. [keys jangling] [Joe panting] [indistinct shouting] The prick had nothing on him. He'd a fucking knife. Where were you? You're not so great on your own, are you? Huh? [indistinct shouting] [tap water running] [water falling] [Joe sobbing] [inhales sharply] [announcer] ...Race Night fund-raiser for the kids' Halloween Spooktacular. Don't forget to get your betting cards at the door. [upbeat music playing] Hey. - [woman] Hiya, how are you? - [Margaret] Hi. You can just pop them over there. Thanks. [indistinct conversations] [bartender] How are you? What are you having? Vodka and white. Thanks, Tom. It's coming up. There you are. Hi. Your neighbor said you'd be here. [Tom] 6.90. - No, all right. - No, no, let me. And a pint of lager, mate. Well, this looks like a lot of fun. It's for a good cause. I'll grab that table over there. [softly] Bye. Cheers. Are you gonna bet? I don't know. Maybe later. Here's one. "Pat's Pride." Might be lucky. You never liked his name, did you? - You should go home, Matt. - Yeah, I know. Carol says we need to get on with things. But she doesn't understand. Sure, how could she? We don't have kids. [slow instrumental music playing] Anyway, I like hotel-living. It's good to see you. Right, I'm going to put a few quid on this one. I thought that was you. What are you doing here? What's anyone doing here? Are you all right? Yeah. Who's the man you're with? No one. All right. We used to be married. What's it, an anniversary? [woman clears throat] [on microphone] And quiet now, please. Quiet, please. Hello, everyone. Thanks so much for coming out in support. It's great to see so many of yous. Last chance to place your bets. First race starts in five minutes. [people cheering] You don't mind if I join you? How are you, Joe? [Joe] All right. We're going to a party later. Yeah, where? -[girl 1] It's in a mate's. -[girl 2] You should come with us. Do you need permission from her? The bitch kept Andrew's car. Go on, Margaret. We'll look after him. Nah, I don't think so. Go on, Joe, why don't you go? [girl 1] Are we getting you into trouble? [girl 2] Aw. [chuckles] - What's up with you? - Just leave it. How are you all, this evening? Two, please. Not so lucky tonight, boyo? What's that? All bets are off then? How's that? Oh, God, Matt. Joe! - Matt, are you all right? - Just leave it, will you? - Let me see. - Fuck off, you! [Joe imitating meowing] [girl giggling] [continues imitating] [girl continues to giggle] [door opens] [Joe] Come on. - [girl giggles] - [Joe] Shh. [both panting] [girl] What is it? [both giggle] [both panting] [both grunting] [girl giggling] Good party last night? Not bad. Can I have a go? Can you drive? Go on, just to the end of the street. I don't know, it's not my car. It's not hers either. Go on. All right. [engine starts] [baby crying] [baby crying] [cat meowing] - [cat hisses] - [baby cries loudly] Shh. You're okay. You're okay. Come on. [baby continues to wail] Shh. Shh. Shh. You're okay. Shh. Shh. [continues shushing] [car approaches] What happened? What did you do to him? - A cat scratched him. - I only left him for a minute. -[lady] Will you take me to the hospital? -[Joe] Yeah, of course. [car driving] [water splashing] [panting] [footsteps approaching] Okay? [exhales sharply] [both chuckle] [both panting] [door alarm chimes] [door opens] [woman] Hi, can I help? [Matt] Uh, yeah. I'm just looking for Margaret. [woman] Yeah, hang on, I'll get her for you. [footsteps approaching] - Hey, there's a man... - [mouths] I am not here. [softly] Okay. Sorry, she's not here. She must have just popped out. [Matt] Oh. Okay. - Thanks. - Yeah, no problem. Thank you. [doorbell chiming] [door closes] [boys laughing] [boy] Look who's coming to... Ah, Joey, Joey. Take it, take it. - [breathing heavily] - [cheering] There you go. - Had enough of her then? - Fuck off. Thought your little prick was too small, did she? I fucked her, didn't I? Yeah. Yeah, 'course you fucking did. I'd say she's mad for it, is she, huh? [indistinct talking] [keys jangling] [shutter descending] [doorbell ringing] [baby crying] [Matt] How are you? - Will you have a pint? - You what? Look, that business the other night, let's forget about it. Fine. No hard feelings, huh? What's driving you to her? Fuck off. I need to take a piss. - You're all right. I've got him. - No worries. [Joe] I'm all right. Come on. [phone ringing] [bottles clinking] [phone continues ringing] [automated voice] You have reached the voice mail of: [Margaret's voice] Margaret Brady. Please leave a message after the beep. [beeps] [woman] Hello, Margaret? My name is Sue. I'm looking for me son. I think he called me from this number earlier. His name is Joe. If you know him, could you call me, please? I just want to make sure he's okay. [phone disconnects] [phone beeps] [Joe chuckles] I fucking knew it. This is where you hand over your wallet like a good faggot. [grunts] What the fuck is she dressing you up in his clothes for, huh? Answer me that! Scum! [Matt punching] [Joe grunts] [Joe chuckling] [grunting] [door opens] [doorbell chiming] [doorbell chiming] [doorbell chiming] [doorbell chiming] [cat meowing] [doorbell chiming] [thuds] [banging on door] [Joe panting] [door bangs open] [panting] [Margaret urinating] Fucking crazy bitch. [breathing in fear] [Matt] Margaret, are you okay? [siren blaring] Little pricks. They don't know what to be at. - Will I come in? - No, Matt. I'm fine, really. Accidental drowning. He fell in. It was an accident. That's what they're saying. Thank you, for telling me. Will you go home, Matt? He won't bother you again. They have no respect. [Margaret] What did you do? What were you doing taking a knacker like that in, in the first place, huh? He's just a kid, Margaret. He's just a fucking kid. And what did you go giving him Patrick's clothes for, huh? He needed them. [sniffling] [panting] I'm sorry, Joe. [Joe sobbing] [nurse] Joe? The doctor will see you now, if you want to come with me? I'm all right. Hi. I'm looking for Joe Walsh. I'm his mother. I got a call saying he was brought in. [indistinct conversation] [slow instrumental music playing] [indistinct chatter] Okay. [instrumental music continues]
