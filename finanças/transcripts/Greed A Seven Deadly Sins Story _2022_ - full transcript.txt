That's me, Zuri Brown. My life was beautiful. I had a career I loved, supportive family, loyal friends, a good man. I had it all, and I didn't even know it. Now, sit back and watch as I torch it all. You are... smart, ambitious, and talented. You grew your business from scratch, girl. Your portfolio is bangin', and you have delivered for every single client you've ever had. This is just... a bigger room, a bigger house, with a bigger budget. Then he said to them, "Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed, for not even when one has an abundance, does his life consist of his possessions." You got this. Wish I would've studied my Bible more. Ahh. Yes! Mm. Mm-mm-mm. Stephan, zigzagging all over my lawn. Now... Now don't be gettin' creative on it. M-My lawn's not your canvas. What's that, Mr. Brown? Don't play with me, Stephan. Straight lines. Yeah, I got it, Oscar. Just 10 more minutes and I'll be finished. There's something I want to talk to you about before Zuri gets here. I'm all ears. What's that? I said, I'm all ears! Huh? I... am... all... Punk. Old man. Viv, I've been trying to reach you. We've... we've got a problem. I hear you, Rochelle. Godfrey and I are working on a solution as we speak. In fact, she's just pulling in right now. I'm glad to hear that. We've been bringing in a lot of cash. We've made how much? More than double what we projected. Already? So what's the problem? Viv, I'm talking six figures of Medicaid billing that we need to funnel immediately. The longer it stays in company accounts, the more attention we attract with the IRS. Half the residents we're claiming on are already ghosts. Mm. I must say, I've had worse problems than making too much money. It's a problem if there's nowhere to hide it. What about Don? Padding the invoices for landscaping the grounds of Sunnymeade worked great. We could use his firm again to... Don isn't a friend we can trust anymore, so I, uh... severed ties. But we need to move the money. I can't keep it for much longer. Rochelle, I am already two steps ahead on this. Just make sure you keep it moving on your end, okay? Okay. Let's talk about it later. Yeah. I'll call you back. Zuri Brown? Hi. I'm here to meet with Ms. Anderson. Yeah. I'm quite aware. Miss Anderson has been held up on a call. She sends her apologies. Follow me. I'll take you through to the drawing room. - Ow! - Careful. The floor was polished just yesterday. Right. Thanks for the heads up. Another one of my paintings just sold at that gallery downtown I told you about. Oh, yeah? So do you get enough to quit your day job? Nah. Nah, I still gotta work that construction gig for now. It's a nice sale and all, but I'm not exactly Kehinde Wiley. Uh... He's an artist. Did that Obama portrait? Gotcha. Gotcha! But, I, uh... did earn enough for this. It's beautiful. It's barely a carat, I designed it myself. You think she'll like it? She'd be a fool not to. I knew that this wouldn't feel right without your blessing. You're the only family she's got. I think of you as a son already. Thank you... for trusting me. Mm. So, I was thinking... right here... A fresco. - Mm-hmm. - Huge. Like in some of the old European houses. You know, some of the big firms submitted design proposals, and they were all the same... Staid. I mean, girl, I'm old, not dead. When I saw the adorable nursery you did for Annabelle Cartwright's granddaughter, I demanded your number on the spot. Thank you. I went to college with her daughter, Laura, so it just felt really special to help get her ready to be a mom. Wow. You have such an amazing library. I love to read, too. Yeah. Books showed me the world, possibilities... a gift close to my heart, a gift I'd like to share with others. Read this? Mm-mm. Here. Borrow it. You know... right here could be a reading nook. Upholstered in velvet, a touch of damask, but nothing too heavy... We want to keep it fresh and feminine. I love all of your designs and ideas, so I'm going to commission you. So, let's start in the drawing room and we'll see where we go from there. How quickly did you want this turned around? The budget allowed for a little bit of fat, but I'm sure I could crunch the numbers and make it... Mm-mm-mm. Don't worry about budget. Just get me the best of everything. Let's have some tea. And when I say "tea," I mean the kind that comes in a bottle and a popping cork. That sounds wonderful. Okay, to health, wealth, and happiness, and... throw pillows. Mm. Has this house always been in your family? Girl, I grew up in a shack in Nowheresville, Georgia. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Really. So, then your husband...? Mm. No. Never married. I was about your age when I made a vow to live life on my own terms. Wow. You have a man? Kids? No kids, but I have a man. Stefan. We've been together for three years. Well, what does Stefan do? He's an artist. Oh, would I know him? He graduated from Pratt. So, very talented, but, um, you know, the art world is tough to get into, so right now, he does construction. "Right now..." turns into "a couple more months," turns into "a couple more years," turns into a lifetime. I'm not sure what you mean. Has anyone ever told you to work smart, not hard? It's okay to want more. Here. Had my chef make this especially. Macarons. Mm! There goes my paleo. Forbidden fruit always tastes the sweetest, dear. Eat up. You're the one who's making the money now. - Hey! - Hey. Hey, hey. I got the gig. - Yeah! - Oh! Congratulations, baby. Thank you. Let me fix you a plate. Sit down. I don't need you running after me. I'm not hungry. I had "afternoon tea" with Miss Viv. - "Afternoon tea," huh? - Mm-hmm. So who's Miss Viv and what's the gig? Ohh! She has this incredible house in Baltimore and she's commissioned me to do the drawing room. Oh. "The drawing room." What is she, from Mars? Nah, she's from the South. Self-made. Owns a chain of care homes. Well, maybe she's got a spot here for Oscar. Maybe she's got a son for Zuri. Okay. If all goes well with the drawing room, she'll commission me to do more rooms. And trust me, there's plenty. You know, with the extra money coming in, Daddy, I was hoping that maybe I could help out a little bit more... Maybe get you a nurse. I'm fine. I will not have you spending money on me. Daddy, we could maybe get a stair-lift or... I said, I'm fine. Hmm? - Okay. - Yeah? - Right? - Okay. Fine. No, you're always doing... Lord... Thanks, baby. Leave me alone! Okay. Try this next one. I want to go up in the... buh... buh... Sound it out, Russ. You're doing great. Buh-loo-nah. Balloon! Oh. Balloon. Boom. You got it. I can't read, but even I know this book is as boring as hell. Russell, I can't wait to loan you some books from my collection. I think you'd love "Iceberg Slim." - Hmm. - Sounds like a rapper. He's a novelist. Was a pimp, but mad smart, you know? His books are real gritty, all about street life and hustling and all that... Sorry to interrupt... but we've got a visitor. Please extend a warm welcome to Godfrey Anderson. He's just been appointed to chair our Board of Trustees. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you, guys, for letting me be a part of your session this evening. Godfrey, could you tell us a little about yourself? Uh, okay. Uh, let's see, aside from being the newly-appointed chair of the Baltimore Literacy Foundation... Which I am really excited about... Uh, I chair a few other non-profits. I have several other businesses which keeps me very, very busy. Uh, let's see. Downtime. I love to cook. He can cook for me any day. Stop. Thank you, Godfrey. Yeah, yeah, but how about y'all? I mean, you're taking this step to empower yourselves, and that just uplifts the entire community. I'm in awe. Really. Thank you. Thank you. Tyrone? I was hoping you could share your story. I'm Tyrone. Most of y'all know me. Born and bred right here in Baltimore. Lakewood Heights. Long story short... My mom died when I was real young. I bounced around group homes and ended up dropping outta school. I got caught up in some bad stuff and wound up doing a bid. I was 19, couldn't read or write. The Baltimore Literacy Foundation were running some courses at the pen, and after I got out, they welcomed me into this community, and I never looked back. With the help of Zuri, Karima, Charles, and other volunteers, I got my literacy up to a level where I could enroll on a G.E.D. course. So I went to night school, graduated. 4.0 G.P.A. Really? So, after a year of community college, everyone here encouraged me to apply to other colleges. They said, if I got in, they'd grant me a scholarship. So... I did. And next semester, I'm transferring to Morgan State College. Whoo! Wow. Wow. You have one new message. Hey, we got out late. I'm not gonna have time to make it home and change. I've got a dress and I'm changing in the car, but I need shoes. Can you bring me a pair? Just pick any pair you like. I'm wearing a black dress so you can't go wrong. Love you. I'm sorry! I didn't mean to scare you. I was talking to some people from the group, and I saw you walk by, and, damn, you walk fast! But I saw you get in the car, but I never saw you leave, and I just want to make sure you're okay. I'm, yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Oh! Wow. You look really, really good. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. No, I'm-I'm fine. I'm on my way to a dinner and I didn't have time to go home and change, and I just had a dress in the car. - Yeah. - Hi. I'm... Zuri. I know. - I'm... - Godfrey. - Yeah. - Yeah, I know. So, so nice. Uh, look, so how long have you volunteered there? Off and on since college. Really? Karima and Charles are like family now. I just love being part of it. - Yeah. - How did you hear about us? Well, I escorted my cousin to a fundraiser a few months back. I met some members of the board, and here we are. I'm surprised I didn't see you there, because I would have definitely remembered you. Only the bigwigs get invited to those events... Not us lowly volunteers. Really? Well, that changes as of now. In fact... we're having an event in a few days, and after seeing Tyrone, I'm more determined to pull in as much support as we can. Yeah. Uh, that's my direct contact right there, and you can drop me an email or a text. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. And feel free to invite your partner, your friend. Uh, where's it gonna be? Well, it's actually at my cousin's house. She's redecorating and... between you and me, I'm-I'm sensing a strong motivation to help a great charity, and an equally strong motivation for her to just show off her swag. I'm actually an interior designer. You wouldn't happen to know who's doing the revamp, would you? She found someone through her friend's... sister's cousin... something. It had something to do with a nursery she... Wait. Is your cousin Cassandra Vivian Anderson? The one and the same... You know her? You're the decorator! I'm the decorator. You're the decorator! Yes! Miss Viv is amazing. Yeah. Yeah, she's a powerhouse, but what beautiful synchronicity. Really. Well, look, I know you gotta get to your dinner. And, uh, please, make sure you come to the fundraiser. I... I'll see you there. - I insist. - Okay. All right. Goodnight. Goodnight! Hey, babe. You got the shoes? Mm! You got dinner at eight and you running from the cops at ten. You're clowning me, right? You told me to grab a pair I liked. Stefan, these were never meant to see the light of day outside of our bedroom. And that was a one-time thing. But you look good in them and you told me you were wearing a black dress, - and so I thought... - You thought that I would want to go to a birthday dinner for my best friend's doctor husband, dressed like I just left Magic City? Stefan! What were you thinking? I got you. That's not funny. We gon' be all right! You play too much. Thank you. Let's go. Everyone! - This is Zuri and Stefan. - Hey. Clifton, Josh, Rita, and Marla. Zuri and Audra were roommates in college. Zuri, I'm sure you see a few familiar faces here? Yes. So sorry we're late. Thanks, hon. This looks wonderful. Thank you. Dive in, everybody. Finally. We do our company retreats there every year. It's just how you would have imagined it. Incredible beaches. I bring the wife and kids. - Really? - Yeah. Even better on the company dime. My... My folks are actually from the island. Have you been? One of these days. The, uh, "holiday fund" always seems to end up turning into something like the rent fund. That's not true. We should celebrate the paintings you just sold. You're an artist? That's what they tell me on the building site. Yes. He is an artist. He has some pieces right now at the Araminta Webster Gallery. Yeah. Everyone? Meet my publicist. Uh, sculpture? Paintings? Oil on canvas. He just got a review that said he's like "Basquiat meets Monet." My work can be a little abstract, sure, but that article was lazy. What I like about oil on canvas is... Yeah, but the painting sold for, like, $3,000. Maybe "Basquiat meets Monet" isn't such a bad thing, babe. You know? Finally hang up that hardhat and high-vis, start making some real cash. Who's ready for dessert? You know, my firm's refurbishing offices. We're looking for some artworks. Maybe I could get your card? Yeah. I don't have a card, but, uh, I could give you my number. I'd love to show you some of my pieces. Here. Take mine. He's way too laidback about these kinds of things. I'll make it happen. Well, what can I say? My girl has a lot more hustle than me. Ahem. You're no fun. Cut it out, Zuri. I'm not in the mood. What do you mean, you're not in the mood? What was all that stuff about at dinner? What? What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. What are you, my agent now? Why are you so mad? Honey, I'm just proud of you. You're the exact opposite of proud. Why do you always have to act so humble, huh? Just fake it until you make it, Stefan. Anyone would think that you don't want to be successful. Yeah, well, maybe I don't define my success by the amount of zeros in my bank balance. Well, it's a good thing you don't. You humiliated me at dinner! You graduated from one of the top art schools in this country. You're not humiliated working on a building site? Lately, all you talk about is money and how you can get more of it. It's called ambition! Nah. It's called being a fake-ass wannabe. And you know what? It's ugly as hell. I'm sleeping down here tonight. Enjoy the bed. Fine. - Goodnight. - Mm-hmm. Okay, Rochelle, what is this all about? I just got off the phone. It is getting too hot. They're investigating Willowbrook Residential right now. I spoke with a friend of mine who works there and she says you can't move for auditors who are looking everywhere and at everything, and they're clean. Well, Medicaid billing accounts for, what, 45% of our revenue? I'm not going to jail for you or anybody. Don't get greedy, Godfrey. We... have to make up the deficit. Impossible. You can't... Can we try, Rochelle? Look. We can put our contracts up for tender, we can tell the existing service providers that, hey, "your competition, they're coming in cheaper than you." We can cut back on staffing costs, Rochelle! But we need capital. We're stretched to breaking, Godfrey. That's how I know you're gonna make it work. Mm-hmm. You will make it work, and we'll meet again next week, and you will update me on your progress. - Ah! - Sorry. Come in, Pat. Have a seat. You're still here. Your shift finished an hour ago. You know we don't pay unauthorized overtime. I know. One of my residents was upset. I wanted to make sure she was okay before I left. So... what can I do for you? The paperwork with several of my Medicaid clients doesn't add up. Look, right here. We're billing for hospice care and a bunch of tests they don't need. Pat... I've worked in residential care for well over 30 years... I thought I should bring this to you. It doesn't add up. Well, I appreciate your concern, but what I'm saying is that I'm sure it's simply been an administrative error. Nothing to cause alarm. Leave the paperwork with me and I'll look into it, okay? Okay. Um... should I close the door? No, no. I have an open-door policy. What an amazing client to land! You gonna rise, Zuri. Girl, I'm just getting started. You can never have too much. That so? Why didn't Stefan want to come? He said it wasn't his thing. It's like all we do is fight lately. Mm. Anyway, I'm just glad I get to spend time with my girl. By the way, did you speak to Marla about him showing his paintings? Yeah, I'm working her. He'll get a shot. Good evening, Baltimore! Can I have your attention, please? That's right. Come on in. Thank you so much for coming out tonight. It's really great to see so many familiar faces hidden behind masks. But all jokes aside, we are here to highlight the work of the Baltimore Literacy Foundation. Tonight, you can save lives. Every cent will go towards uplifting individuals in our city so that they, too, can become their best selves. "Each one teach one." Thank you! Thank you so much. Zuri. I'm glad you came. Great speech. Uh, Audra, this is Godfrey. Godfrey, Audra. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleasure. Shall we get a drink? You look a little lost. I'm looking for my girlfriend. Oh, well, maybe I can help you. I'm Cassandra Vivian Anderson. Everyone calls me Miss Viv. Miss Viv! I'm Stefan. Oh. Stefan Gardner. Zuri Brown is my girlfriend. Oh! The starving artist. Upholstery isn't the only thing she has good taste in, I see. I think I see her. Excuse me. Catch you later. Way to work the room. Miss Viv did not exaggerate your charms. Well, I learned everything I know from my cousin. In fact, she's been singing your praises. She flat-out instructed me to make sure that I hire you to make my house a home. Well, Miss Viv is a very smart woman. I'll have my assistant reach out so we can get the ball rolling. Great. Oh, sir, uh, can we get some drinks for the ladies? What'll it be? Stefan, hi! Hey. Hey, babe, what a surprise. Stefan? You're Stefan. The artist. Uh... masquerading as a caterer? I usually get invited to these things to, you know, help the aristocrats feel... relevant. I'm here for my girl. Stefan... uh, Godfrey. Godfrey, Stefan. Quite the party. Look, those donation baskets, they're not gonna fill themselves. So, I'll leave you guys to it. Zuri. I can't wait to see what you're gonna do with my place. I love this song. Let's go dance. Hi! Hi. Ooh. Houndstooth. I like it. - You look amazing. - Thank you. So... I like minimalism, but this is just spartan. And I think you can give it some life. Godfrey, this place is stunning. Come on, let me give you the tour. Uh... But you're gonna have to take them heels off. I can't have you messing up my hardwood floor. The floor! I'm just messing. Come on. Let's start at the top. After you. And most of these wines are Argentine, but I have... Oh, wow. I have a few that I picked up in Bordeaux that you have to try. Wow. I'd love to go some day. Yeah. Yeah, you should. What would you like to do with this area? Huh. Probably leopard print and, um, neon. I'm kidding. Okay, good. All right, these are just some sketches, but, um... I was thinking, for color palette, maybes browns and beiges for warmth... Hmm. And then you could add in a little bit of texture with some authentic raw cowhide, maybe some modern mid-century furniture... Yeah. I like that. I like that. That's... That's really amazing. Good. And this... is your day rate. For the month. And I think that's enough to make inroads on some of those amazing ideas. Yeah? Yeah, I think I can make it stretch. Good. Thank you. Thank you. I feel overdressed. You look amazing. I told you that already. I'm proud to have you on my arm in jeans and sweats, let alone looking like that. Whoa. Um... Order anything you want from the sides, baby. I don't think I can afford the mains. We can go halves. I'm just kidding, baby. You know that. I'm sorry. Really, this is... This is great. So? How'd it go today? Did moneybags like the color? I keep telling you, his name is Godfrey, and, yeah, it was a hit. The room looks great. Oh! Did you talk to Marla about the paintings that she was interested in? We spoke today. And? I was too late. They've spent the budget... Something about buying out half the Jones Gallery, apparently. How many times did I say that you needed to move fast on this? There'll be other opportunities. How? You know, I pushed Audra to set up that meeting for you. She liked your work, had a lot of office space... You could've made a ton of sales. We don't know that. Do you want to work at a building site forever? This again? I actually like my job. No, you're coasting, and no matter what I say or do, it's like you don't want to keep up with me. Keep up? What are we racing towards? I would like to own a home before having kids. Is that too much to ask? Maybe go on a vacation? Stefan, you are so talented. I... I just want you to live up to your potential. Yeah. Ouch. Ooh! It seized right up. Daddy, I've told you a million times... Leave the trash. I'll take it out. You know, I hate having you looking after me. You're my pops! I want to look after you. You know, even as a little girl, you always wanted to help. You know, looking after your dolls, the cats next door. You know, I always hoped, when you grew up, that you would find a man to look after you. What, baby? Did you and Mom ever have doubts that you were right for each other? Well, you know, relationships aren't always sunshine and flowers. We had our rough patches, sure, but I always knew that life would be better with her by my side. Stefan and I have been fighting a lot lately. What? Really? What...? We're just so different. He's so laidback, and I've always loved that about him, but we're not in our 20s anymore. Meaning? Daddy... you did great and I couldn't have asked for a better pop, but we struggled. If I have kids, I want to make sure that I can spend time with them, give them opportunities, not work every hour just to make ends meet. Stefan loves you, Zuri. I know... but lately, I've been feeling less like his woman... more like his mom. I wouldn't dream of telling you how to live your life, honey, but I raised you to be decent and kind. Don't string anyone along. You hear? I hear you, Daddy. I do. This should go the other way. Hmm. Wow. Wow! I mean, completely transformed. I actually want to spend time in this space now. Well, you work so hard. You deserve to have a beautiful home. Yeah. I just don't have anybody to share it with. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Zuri. I'm just a man who... pursues what he wants. You are smart, beautiful, so talented and... loyal. Look, I know that you're trying to work things out with him, and you made that abundantly clear, and I respect that. But I'm saying this as a friend. Don't settle for a life that you don't want. You have ambition. You have drive. People in your life, they either give you weight or wings. Which one is he? Hmm? The right man by your side... the sky's the limit with you. Will you fly with me, Zuri? Will you fly with me? Mm. Hey, Stefan. It's me. Um, I was just calling to let you know that I'm safe and I'm gonna need to take a couple of days to myself. I'm... having some second thoughts about us. I'll call you later. Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for He has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Zuri? Stefan. - Don't. - I'm sorry. Keep it. Keep it, really. I've got no use for an engagement ring. But, the money... you could sell it. Zuri, don't you get it? The money's not important. Never was, never will be. No matter what you wear, what vacation you go on, who your clients are... it'll never be enough to keep you from believing that voice inside your head that keeps telling you that you're not good enough. You don't love him. You just love what he can get you. I'm out of here. Why aren't you ready? Am I supposed to be somewhere? There's nothing on my calendar. Pack your bags. Car's outside. We're going to the Barbados! - You're kidding. - I'm serious. You're funny. Come on. I'm serious! Really? Let's go do something... in Barbados. Come on. Yeah! Attention, everyone. As you know, I'm not one to mince words, so here it is... We're cutting everyone's hours at the end of the month. Geoff's gonna brief you on the details, and we'll have an "all hands" between shifts on Friday. I'm sorry, I really am. Board decision. Is there a cut in workload, too? I know I'm barely getting my tasks done and I haven't taken a lunch break in over two years. As I said... Geoff's gonna brief you, and, as always, I've got an open door, so come see me if you want to talk one-on-one. Uh, hi, everyone, I'm Geoff, as Rochelle was saying. Yeah, I'm gonna brief you now on the... new policy. Thank you. I didn't know what to pack so I brought everything. Okay. So, um... I have another surprise for you. You are now a member of the board of the Baltimore Literacy Foundation. What? I just need you... to sign... right on that line. Right th... oh, if you accept, of course. - Really? - Really. And this way, you get an actual voice. I love that you are always looking for ways to help me grow. This is gonna give your credentials some real weight. Gonna appeal to investors as we expand "Zuri Design." And all the other spin-offs. So? Are you in? Of course I'm in! There you go. And in their greed, they will exploit you with false words. Yeah. That's my girl. Let's go. I love it. Want to try it on? Let's trade. All right. Okay. And... It's beautiful. It is. Mm. This is the life I always dreamed of. This is the life you deserve. And more. Actually... I just bought these... I'm expanding the company. I'm so proud of you. And you will get the contracts for the interiors, of course. My CFO is handling the finances... and a competitor just came in with a better offer, and we need to match it by the end of the week, or else the deal's off. What are you going to do? Well, I was hoping you could help. - Me? - Yeah, you. As a member of the board, you can co-sign for the release of funds. For capital. Wait. Is that why you got me on the board? For this? Zuri... I got you on the board because you deserve it. I'm just sorry nobody saw it sooner or wanted you to grow. Why can't you use your own money? Is something wrong? Baby, look around. Do I look broke to you? Look, we're already in the process of selling off some real estate to raise capital, but that's gonna take months. We gotta move now. What if you lose the money? I've been investing money for a long time and your man is very good... at what he does. How long before you put it back? Just a few days. That's all. I buy the homes, and you get a contract that's gonna take your company to six figures. Secure your future, Zuri. Our future, baby. The foundation is gonna have enough funding to put kids to college for the next 10 years. So what do you say? Fly with me, partner? You promise it's just a couple of days? I promise. Okay. Deal. Deal? Let's fly, partner. Zuri, your dad was taking out the garbage and had a fall. He's going to the hospital. Where are you? Hey... big man. I'm gonna take my car and I'm gonna meet you at the hospital. Take care of him. You're gonna be all right. The boys just tied it up, all right? Audra! What... what you doing here? Zuri sent me to take over. She's on the first flight back tomorrow. Oh, I told her to stay and enjoy her vacation. I'm fine. His arm is broken in three places, his blood pressure's a little low, and he has a minor concussion, but aside from that, he's fine. Because of his age, though, we're gonna keep him overnight for observation. Yeah, right. You didn't need to come. Are you kidding me? Oscar fed me through most of college. It's my pleasure to be here. That's my girl. She told me to say thanks. All right, old-timer. You call me if you need anything, all right? I'm gonna stop by the house tomorrow - and check on you. - Thanks, son. So how you been? I've been fi... what? What did you do? Oh, I fell. Ah, girl, the resort was amazing. Godfrey insisted on a seaside view. Mm-hmm. Okay. What is up with you? You've been pissy all day. Nothing's up with me. Meaning? It's "Godfrey this" and "Godfrey that." Godfrey didn't even show up at the hospital. Uh, he had a meeting. And Stefan had a shift that he canceled so he could look after the father of the woman who's just broken his heart. Is he okay? He's putting a brave face on it, but, nah, not really. Well, it's just gonna take some time. I don't get it, Zuri. You're throwing him away, just like that? I'm not throwing anyone away. We're just not compatible. What happened, Zuri? It was a done deal... That's what you said when you guys moved in together, before you were ever married. Okay, what is your problem with Godfrey? I don't know. It's like you are different when you're around him. Just come out and say it. When did you become so materialistic? Wow. You have never had to worry about money a day in your life. Yeah. You're right. Maybe that's why I can see the only thing that Godfrey has that Stefan doesn't is a couple of bags. How dare you? - Right there. - I won't fight you. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Okay. Oh, oh... Oscar, you home? Hello? Hey. Stefan. Zuri... Oscar's friend. - I'm not home. - Mm-hmm. We're just in the middle of his physical therapy. - Ah... - Sorry to interrupt. Don't mind me. Oscar, shall we finish? Just a couple more reps and then we're done for today. Sure, Pat. Thank you. Easy... Ahh. That's a nice set. Yeah. Um, a gift from Zuri. She was here last week... With Slick Willy. She okay? Well, they didn't stay very long. She brought that. But I'm happy with the old one. She seems, uh... happy. How about you? So how's your father? Better. I've kept Pat on. She's great. His mobility has improved a lot. Nice watch. How's business? Crazy busy with clients. I'm starting a soft furnishings line, and Godfrey is gonna set up a meeting with Sizl. He just bought in the city and, but... you know. There's always room for improvement. Viv? Thank you so much. Doing this place really got the ball rolling for me. That's okay. Ooh. I'll send you an invoice. Or... to be precise... You can send me an invoice. I don't understand. Send me an invoice for that amount each month from your company and I'll give you 5% of every transaction. My accountants will handle the books and will forward the money into an offshore account. Where does the money come from? Zuri, do you really want to know that? Look around. This isn't dirty money. I'm a businesswoman and Godfrey is a businessman. Sometimes, you have to make a few moves here and there to keep it moving. So, are you in or out? For, from the least of them even to the greatest of them, everyone is greedy for gain, and, from the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely. Make it 10%. When do we start? Tyrone Raymond? How can I help? I got an email asking me to come and discuss my tuition. Okay. Can I get your student number, please? Thank you. Oh... I'm sorry, but there is a balance on your tuition that hasn't been settled. There must be a mistake. That's what it's got on my system. Look, you're not gonna be able to attend classes until it's resolved. This is suspended for now. I'm sorry. Are you sure? Yes. I'm sure. Nice, Oscar! Wait till I show Zuri! Maybe I can even walk her down the aisle! She's getting married? To Godfrey Anderson? Well, she's hopeful, all right. And he seems to be all in, uh... ahh! His family own the care homes, right? Something like that. Why? Do you know him? The home I work at is owned by the G. Anderson Enterprise. Ah. So what is it you're not telling me? Every home I've worked at, they squeeze everything they can from you. But that... that's usual. But there's something about that place that's... different. Ah! Nothing. Forget it. - I shouldn't have said anything. - Wait, wait, wait. Nuh-uh. There's nothing to tell. Now, do you want to try again? - Sure. - Yes! All right, on your feet, young man. All right. There's just a couple more things I want to show you. Okay. Don't worry. This is gonna be hung. So what do you think? I love it. In fact, I love everything, and I'm notoriously picky. You? Never. Mm. Who's the artist? His name is Stefan Gardner. He's an emerging artist. This is good work. Oh. And you're padding the invoices for your clients like I showed you? You were right... Art works. It's almost too easy. Yes. I've been doing this a long time. Mm. Just watch, listen, and learn. Mm? Can I get you a coffee? I'm actually okay, thank you. Have a seat. Ah. I'm so glad you called. I missed you. Tyrone, everyone. I miss you too, Zuri. I don't recognize you anymore. It's still me. Just in better clothes. You know what I mean. We've known each other a long time and underneath all this fake-ass flossing, I'm hoping that the Zuri I know and love is still there, so I wanted to give you a heads-up. Okay, if this is about Godfrey... Damn right, it's about Godfrey. Embezzling the foundation's funds, and Lord only knows who else's. No! You've got it all wrong. So why won't he hand over the accounts? No one knows what was raised at the last event. I heard it was $2,000 a ticket... 300 guests. Okay, Miss Viv and Godfrey bankrolled that whole event. Maybe so, but everyone was there for a cause, and that cause wasn't to line Anderson's pockets. Where's the money, Zuri? You are making some serious accusations. When that house burns, Zuri, you're going to burn with it. I'm warning you... get out now. I'm gonna do just that. And you know what else? Before the designer clothes and the fancy car, you actually had way more class. Do not be misled. Bad company corrupts good character. He says that bad company influences your character and I'm standing here like the Apostle Paul did with the Corinthian church, saying "Come to yourself." Why? Because, before you leave here, I want you to know that there is never a bad time to be good. Now, in a few seconds, you're gonna get the opportunity to worship the Lord in giving. Now, what I want you to do is worship the spirit of generosity. As our team play softly, let's give. I'm so happy to be here, Daddy. Ah, thank you for bringing me, baby. It's so good to spend time with you. I know, I'm sorry. I've just been so busy. Ah, I didn't want to guilt-trip you. I'm just so glad that your business is doing so well. So, uh... everything okay with, uh, Slic... Godfrey? I'm really happy. You can always come home, you know that, don't you? I know you don't like him, Daddy, but he's really... he's really good for me. He's helped me a lot. Okay. As long as you know. Thank you. Where'd that money come from? Ah, Ms. Brown. Miss Anderson did not tell me she was expecting you. - That's because she's not. - Excuse me... Is she here? I will seek Miss Anderson. Excuse me! He who profits illicitly troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live. Sorry, Madam. I tried to stop her. No. No. It's okay, Clayton. Thank you. As you wish, Madam. Well, what a lovely surprise. Please, sit. It's fine. I'm not staying. Is something wrong? I just came to tell you that I'm done with the invoicing. From here on out, I'm running a clean business. I think you're confused, Zuri. You don't get to say when you're done. You wouldn't have a business if it wasn't for me. That's not true. You opened a lot of doors, but... I made you. You were nothing but a pawn from go... An insecure, greedy little something. I read you... the minute I laid eyes... click-clacking your way up my drive. This is ugly. Hmm? I told you, I'm done, and now I'm leaving. Well, how do you think your clients are gonna feel when they find out you've been swindling them? Mm. You're in way too deep, and this isn't the movies. Uh-uh. You don't get to just walk away. He's caught up in some really serious stuff, and I'm mixed up into it, too, Daddy. Deep. There's always a way out, baby. No. No. No. This is a dark hole, Daddy. I don't know how I'm gonna climb out of this. You're a grown woman, Zuri. And it pains me to stand by and let you make your own decisions. I was waiting for you to come to me. We're gonna figure this out together. - I'm sorry, Daddy. - Together! I'm sorry, Daddy. Ah, here we are. - Ah, thank you. - Thank you! And thank you for coming. Yeah. Are you okay? Not really. Now, I want you to tell me everything you know about G. Anderson Enterprises and how they run their homes. I don't know anything for sure. What do you think you know? Pat, you've been caring for me for a few months now and I know how you play. If you even have a hunch, then you're likely onto something, and I want all the information I can get, to protect my daughter. - Okay. - Mm. Good. Let's talk about it. Hey, baby, what's... what's... oh. Tell me it's not true. Are you... Are you outta your damn mind? The tuition fees... Why haven't they been paid? - That's being handled. - So it's true? You stole the money? Whoa! You told me that you were gonna put it right back right away. I didn't steal anything. Then why's everyone acting like the money just disappeared? It'll clear the foundation's accounts by tomorrow. It should've been today, but I was on a call and I missed the cut-off time. And I'm the only one that can do the transfer, remember? I don't believe you. Wow. Oh, man. Look. As promised. With interest. By tomorrow, all the students' tuition will be paid for the whole academic year. Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold, but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others. Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay are those who gain riches by unjust means. When their lives are half gone, their riches will desert them, and in the end, they will prove to be fools. I found out the truth about Godfrey. Turns out G. Anderson Enterprises is involved in some serious shade. Medicaid fraud... Spanning years and millions of dollars. Look. I have photos of everything. When I leave, I'm taking the documents with me. I'm gonna need a lawyer and a shovel to dig my way out of this one. Are you in that deep? I honestly didn't know that it was this dark, but I knew that what I was doing was wrong. And illegal. I chose to look away. A lot. Why, Zuri? You fell for him that hard? No. I think I fell for... the princess dream. Yes. Do not wear yourself out to get rich... Do not trust your own cleverness. Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle. What? I spoke to Viv today. Where's my money? It's not your money, sweetie. No, I earned that money. Through kickbacks and side hustles? I'd say over half of what's in that account is income generated by me and Viv. Why are you doing this? Really. I want to know. Well... because I didn't want you to do anything silly. Because I needed insurance, while I clean up this mess. You know, all this time that we've been sleeping in the same bed, it was because I truly believed that we were gonna be husband and wife. Hmm. What was I to you? Zuri, every relationship in my life is transactional. Everyone has a purpose. Everyone has a use. What did you think? That we were just gonna ride off into the sunset like Bonnie and Clyde? You were useful. You were a great way to launder money. I didn't even have to persuade you! I didn't even show you anything of myself that wasn't... superficial. You're ruthless! Ambitious. Greedy. If I'm greedy, so are you. No. Godfrey Anderson, you are in a league all your own. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. 'Cause you are definitely not in my league. I need a real hustler by my side. Thank you for seeing me. Any time. What's going on? It has been a steep learning curve. I've betrayed almost everyone who trusts me. God forgives everything. There's no mistakes, only lessons. But... what did you think you were gaining? Validation? And you got what? I lost everything. It doesn't look like that to me. It seems like you gotta lose the negative mindset. But all the other stuff? It's just stuff. God's working on something for you right now. But you gotta think about what you do have... Redemption. What if I don't deserve it? Zuri, you're God's child. That alone is what makes you deserving. Let's pray. Come on. Dear God, protect and guide Zuri with your light. Clear a path in front of her so that she may walk in truth and service. Mm! - Amen. - Amen. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. Shh. Keep it down. Don't wake the neighbors. Come on. So I guess we're roomies for the foreseeable, huh, Oscar? You got the bed, I'll take the couch. I'll, uh, call you first thing, okay, Dad? Thank you. This is the only place that Godfrey wouldn't know about, so I know he'll be safe... with you. You can stay, too, Zuri. Really. I can double up with your pops. No. I'm okay. I really didn't deserve you. Thanks again. Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position. But the rich should take pride in their humiliation, since they will pass away like wildflower. The offshore money is clean. It's the homes where we're vulnerable. The only flaws with billing... And lucrative as it was... Is the paper trail, and there's no way around that. I only see one way out of this. We get outta here. I have a passport ready. I got one for you, too. Get outta here? - Like, run? - Yeah. Run from my home? Run from everything I've built? Godfrey, you were raised in privilege. I was not. You don't come from a shack in the woods to a mansion in Baltimore without getting your hands a little grimy from time to time. I see another solution. We get rid of the problem. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold up. She's powerless. Viv, she's powerless. She has no money. She has no clients. When we're done, her reputation is gonna be in tatters. She can't incriminate us without putting herself in center frame, and I know her. She's way too selfish for that. I've taken care of this. She's done! And that's a gamble you wanna take? What if she does talk? You said it for yourself... That she didn't have nothing to lose. 35 years... in a federal prison. You'll be an old man by the time they let you go. An old... broke... man. Why don't we just talk about this tomorrow, after you've had a chance to calm down? Sit your ass down! Okay. So how... how do we do this? Do you have someone that you... Rule number one... We don't trust no one. We take care of this ourselves. Such are the paths of all those who go after ill-gotten gain... It takes away the life of those who get it. Godfrey. Zuri. Are you ready to talk? I've nothing to say to you. I have your money. Uh, I just took out what's mine. I earned that money! How dare you put your slimy hands in my pocket? Look, do you want it or not? I was angry and you hurt me. You turned on me, just like that. I didn't turn on you, Godfrey. I just didn't want to be part of all the shadiness. That's what it felt like. Look, I never told you, but, cousin Viv, she raised me. She's like a sister to me, and I'm very protective of my family, Zuri, and I lashed out, and I-I'm really sorry. By "lashed out," do you mean stole my money? I was always gonna give it back... I told you that. Look, you can come get your money tonight. You know I don't trust you as far as I can throw you, Godfrey. Whatever, Zuri. How long did we sleep in the same bed? Huh? Did I ever treat you with anything less than respect? Did I ever hurt you? What about Pat? I know you had her beaten up. Pat? Y-Your dad's nurse Pat? Why would I do that? Look, I found that little chain you used to wear. My mom's cross? I don't know if it's your mom's cross, but I know it's that little chain you used to wear when I first met you. I'll come by in an hour. No. No, no. Come by tonight, because it's gonna take me a little time to get the money. I'll have it by 10 p.m., but... look, do what you want, Zuri, but just swing by, get the cash, and leave. Hey. You can just put the money through the window? Zuri, are you for real? For real, for real. Here's the necklace. Here's the money. T... Viv! Get out of the car, Zuri. - W... - Get out of the car! Viv, what's the plan? Shut up. Let's go. W... Viv... - I said, shut up. - Viv. Hey! What are you doing? I'm handling my business! 'Cause if you'd have took care of yours, we wouldn't be here. She already went to the cops, Godfrey. I got an informant who told me so. Well, why didn't you come to me and tell me when you found out? She's about to bring down a whole lot of rubble on your head... And mine. She got a tip... And you know from who? A nurse who worked for her dad. Now, I had the nurse hit off, figured she'd back off and mind her own, but my god, we're talking about a nurse and a decorator here. Turns out... the nurse worked for Westgate. Ooh... you didn't notice, huh, Godfrey? Because you never were good with the details. Big-picture man, huh? That's you. Uh... You didn't see this in your picture? Hmm? Why? Why are you doing this? Because it's either me or you. Now I've really taught you everything I know. Viv, whatcha gonna do? You gonna kill me? No, no, no. We're family. I'm not gonna kill you. I'm gonna make it look like you killed your damn self! Zuri? Stefan. Stefan, wake up. Huh? What? Oscar. What's... What's happening? What's going on? It's Zuri. She's not answering her phone. Oh... What time is it? 3:35. Mm, yeah, that's why she's not answering her phone. Can I get you something? Some warm milk or... Man, the last time I looked, I wasn't five years old. Man, I'm telling you, there's something wrong. All right. Karima gave me Godfrey's address. I'll check on Zuri. Morning, dear. Oh, you're probably feeling a little woozy. Fentanyl. Yeah. I used to be a nurse, remember? It's a very powerful opiate. I put a speck on your tongue, and it disappeared just like that. A little speck more... you'd be dead. But what'd be the fun of that? Yeah. All right. You know... I'm gonna go dramatic for you. Yeah. Let's see... Killed in a house fire after a violent struggle with her ex... who you betrayed. Yeah. Who then put a bullet through his own skull. Bingo. I like that. Hmm. Yeah. It's gonna be hot in here for you. Somehow, I believe you like it hot. Yeah. Yeah! Come and get her. Dear Lord, thank you for all of my blessings... Damn! Zuri! Zuri! Zuri? Zuri! Thank you for Stefan and his generosity. Don't turn around. Put your hands where I can see 'em. And thank you for guiding Zuri back towards the light. And may you continue to watch over her, illuminating her path with love and light. Amen. Now how are we gonna do this? Because it needs to look like a suicide, and I sense the reluctance to put the gun in your mouth. You're a psychopath. No! I'm a survivor. Are you? I think not. I think that you are a jealous lover who kills his ex-girlfriend and the new man. Tale as old as time... and good headlines. Now... Devil's in the details. Just a speck of this on your skin and you'll be incapacitated. Zuri! Zuri! Zuri! It's all right. You're safe. I got you. Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you. Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. Everyone comes naked from their mother's womb, and as everyone comes, so they depart. They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands. Quick. Listen to the news. Baltimore power-players Cassandra Vivian Anderson and Godfrey Anderson were convicted today and sentenced to a life sentence, and 25 years respectively, for their part in murder, fraud, and embezzlement across a number of businesses, spanning decades. Cassandra Vivian Anderson was implicated in the execution of Baltimore businessman Don Jackson. A number of whistleblowers came forward to authorities. Back to you. Yes, I was just calling to confirm that you received the final repayment? Great. Thanks again for your patience and understanding. Okay. Bye. So, is this a job interview? An audition? What? Thanks for coming. There's never anybody here on the weekends and I'm still at my dad's. This is a conversation that I wanted to have in private. What's done is done. We don't need to do a post-mortem. I know. But you do deserve an apology. I am so sorry, Stefan. I was just so dissatisfied with myself and... what I thought I should have that I lost sight of who I was and who you are. You're smart, funny, kind, and I had to have been out of my mind to have lost sight of that for even a second. Well... sorry I put you on the spot. Um... I'm sorry that I made a fool of myself, but I just needed to get that off of my heart, Stefan, so... Thank you. You wouldn't happen to know about this big order from Sizl. He says his decorator turned him onto my work. I don't know anything about that. You deserve to be happy, and I want that for you above everything, and I hope that you find a woman that can love you the way that you deserve.
