Summer nights are pleasant in Caulfield. They smell of heliotrope and jasmine, honeysuckle and clover. The breeze that stirs the curtains is soft and gentle. There's the hush, the stillness of perfect peace and security. Oh, yes. The summer nights are pleasant in Caulfield. But not for us. Not for us. The house we live in is so pleasant. The lawn always seems freshly watered, the beds of flowers so neat, the dazzling whiteness of the porch supports the satin finish of the rich, old floors, the smell of wax. This is a home, warm and friendly as a home should be. But not for us. Not for us. I love him and he loves me. I know he does. And yet I know just as surely that someday he'll pack his things and leave. Though he won't want to. But even if he doesn't leave, I know it will be I who will walk out and never come back. We've fought this thing. How bitterly we've fought it. We've driven it away a thousand times, and it comes back again in... a look, in a thought. You believed our love would be strong enough to make us forget. But we haven't. This is a thing apart. This is... murder. Wanna go out somewhere? It's a nice night. If you think we should. Come on. You can put him to bed. He's asleep now. Yes. Yes. Yes, I knew him. We'll be here. What? The police. Are they coming here now? In a few minutes. Did they say...? Which one of us they want? No. I'll put him to bed. Don't let him suffer for the mistakes I've made. I was wrong. Terribly wrong in what I tried to do. But I was desperate. So desperate. Steve. Steve. Steve. She's here again. Steve. It's me, Helen. Steve. I know you're there, Steve. Let me in, please. Please. Please let me in, please. Oh, Steve, don't do this to me. I came all the way here to find you. I don't know anyone in New York. I haven't anybody. I have to see you. Steve, I'm gonna stay here! I'm gonna stay here! Will you pipe down! Show a little consideration for people who stay up all night. Things is tough enough without having my sleep disturbed by you. Now, scram! Steve, please. Oh, Steve, please. Don't ever try to brush me off like that. Would you take my seat, please? Oh. No, thank you. Go ahead. Take my place for a while. Come on. We want you to. You can't stay out there like that. Come on. We want you to. There you are. Isn't that better, hm? Thank you. You look dead. It's this awful train. It's his fault we're on it. It seems everybody wants to go home for the 4th of July. You wouldn't think a firecracker could be that important, would you? We had tickets on the plane and everything, and at the last moment he wouldn't let me fly. You know, for the same reason your husband probably wouldn't let you fly. And look where that bright idea of his landed us. Here. Well, go someplace. Just don't stand there hovering. Well, if you're sure you're all right, I guess I could go smoke a cigarette. Smoke two. Okay, boss. See how henpecked I am? He's nice, isn't he? I mean, giving me his place. Oh, he's tolerable. He has his good points. I could tell right away, about you I mean. I am too. It's that month. Eh-- Oh, wonderful. Where's your husband? Are you meeting him? No. Oh, did you leave him in New York? No, I... I've lost him. I'm sorry, I'm such a fool. I-- That's all right. It's funny. You never think, do you? No, you never do. He's coming back. He didn't smoke-- We just got rid of you. What are you doing--? Special inside information from the porter. They're just opening the dining car in a couple of minutes. Come on. We'd better get underway. There'll be a stampede in this mob. Come on, let's make a dash for it. Oh. Oh, no, thank you. I'm not hungry. Besides, someone ought to stay here and keep the places. Oh, women are always hungry. And we can use this for a place marker. It's all right. He'll look after everything. Oh, no, it isn't that. It's just that I-- You can't neglect yourself now of all times. I know. Come on. We'll lose him. This is a holiday and I'm off my diet. Well, what have you got? Prime ribs up here are nice today, ma'am. Here you are, sir. Yes, sir, here you are. No, ma'am. You don't want to be riding backwards. Now, if you'd just sit over there, and the ladies will sit here. There you are. There you are. Like to sit here, ma'am? Yes. Mm, pickles. Good sour pickles. Barrels of them. That sounds nice. Uh, may I suggest soup, ladies? Nice vegetable soup and some breast of chicken? I'll tell you what, waiter. Suppose you just go ahead and bring what you think they ought to have. Yes, sir. Heh. He must be a family man. Well, now that we're not strangers any longer, I think you ought to know our names. He's Harkness, Hugh, and I'm Harkness, Patrice. Harkness. That's a funny name, isn't it? Oh, I'm just trying you out for it. I haven't decided yet whether I'll let you keep it or not. It's mine now. I haven't decided whether I'll let you keep it or not. What's your name? Ferguson. Helen Ferguson. You've both been awfully kind to me. Oh. I thought she'd never get out. If anybody else wants to get in, they'll just have to wait. We're nearly the last ones still awake anyway. Here, have some. Oh, you haven't anything to rub off, have you? Here, rub some of this on and then you have that to rub off. Go ahead, take out a gob. I'm not sure what it does for you, but it smells nice anyway. I'm getting scared. About the baby? Uh-uh. I'm meeting my in-laws. Do you think they'll like me? Suppose they don't. Suppose they have me built up in their expectations as somebody entirely different. They don't even know what I look like. Didn't you send them a picture? I didn't have any except my passport picture, and I certainly wasn't gonna send them that. Go on. It feels good. I guess they must be very well off. I know they had to send us the money for the trip home. Hugh only had his salary from one of those government agencies. You know, one of those initial outfits. I just had my scholarship. My folks are all dead. We were on a shoestring the whole time. And don't let anyone tell you how cheap Europe is. We had an awful lot of fun, though. I think that's the only time you do have fun. It's when you're on a shoestring, don't you? Sometimes it's-- Anyway, as soon as they found out I was expecting, that did it. They wouldn't hear of my having the baby over there. I didn't much want to either. Here, hold this for me, will you? I have a horror of losing it. Slipped down the drain once and they had to pull out the whole wall. Oh, it's very beautiful. It has our names around it on the inside. See? Isn't that cute? Mm-hm. That's one of the reasons we're on a shoestring. Here, put it on your finger. It'll be safer that way. Well, isn't that bad luck? I mean, for me to put it on? I couldn't have bad luck. Come on, guys, give us room to work. Who is it? Who is she? Cut off her clothes. - Caesarean section. - Use a local. Plasma. Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! My baby. My baby. Where's my baby? Your baby's all right, dear. No. No, it isn't. It's gone. It's gone. No. No, it isn't, dear. He's in an incubator. H-He? Incubator. Oh-- Is he--? He's perfect. Now, just drink this. A coddled egg, some custard, a little milk every two hours. If she keeps that down all right, maybe in a week or so we can let her see her baby. Nurse. What's this doing here? Why is this here? Everyone who is ill has one. It's just-- But the name. It says-- Does the sight of your own name frighten you? Sh. Now don't talk anymore. But you don't understand. You have to tell me. - Just a moment. - I'll be right back. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor, what happened to--? To whom? There was-- There was another girl in the washroom with me. Is she--? Did you know her very well? No. You only just met her on the train? On the train. She died. Oh. Is there anyone else you want to ask about? What happened to...? To him? What happened to him? Your husband died too, Mrs. Harkness. Oh, no, that-- No, you're making a mistake. There, there. No, please. Please, let me tell you-- Don't talk now. Later. Oh, please, let me tell you. Sh. Please let me tell you. She took it very well. When she wakes up, show her the things the family sent her. If I've left the hospital when they call today, tell them she's doing nicely. And a little dress. With pink and blue ribbon. You can run the blue through the lace when you're stronger. And a wee sweater. Feel how soft. And... And a note. Shall I read it to you? "Patrice, dear, you are all we have now, you and the little fellow. Our daughter and our grandson, Hugh's legacy to us, though we have never seen you. Forgive me for not coming to you, but the shock of Hugh's passing was too much for me. My doctor..." Though we've never seen you. Though we've never seen you. Though we've never seen you. If... If my son... If he weren't the Harkness grandson, would I be allowed to stay in this room? We'd put you right into one of the wards. Why? Are you trying to tell me that he isn't their grandson? No. No, I'm not trying to tell you that. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It isn't too late. I can still back out. It isn't too late. I can still back out. It isn't too late. I can still back out. It isn't too late. I can still back out! Who's there? Caulfield, ma'am. No, wait. It can't be. Sure enough is, ma'am. But so quickly. It's always come between Hastings and Clarendon. It ain't never been no different since I've been on this railroad. I can't go through with it. I can't. I can't. There's-- Caulfield, ma'am. No. No. - Hurry, ma'am. - You only have five minutes. For you. For you. Well, here we are. Man's sake, that train must have been on time for once. We're sure glad you're here. Mrs. Harkness has been stewing and fretting something terrible. Oh. Easy. Sure gonna seem like old times having a baby around here. I'll take him. Father, you and Josie take in the baggage. Come, dear. Welcome home, Patrice. You and the boy, I want you to be very happy here. Thank you. Now, come, I'll show you to your room. I'll bet you thought I didn't remember how to do this. I guess people don't forget. Thank you for letting me have my dinner in my room last night. Oh, pooh. I knew how you felt. Now, young man, you stay right there while granny cleans up all this mess. I'll do it. No. Humor me for a few days, will you, dear? You go and get his bottle, and tell Josie not too hot. All right. - You're mine, my dear. - You're mine. Mine! If you scare me like that again, then I'll hit you over the head with my rolling pin. Hello. Well, you sure have changed since the last time I saw you. When? In the hospital. I'm Bill. Sometimes called Willie, sometimes called William. William. Is that you? See what I mean? Hiya, Duchess. When--? - What are you doing here? We didn't expect you till Thursday. Your wire from San Francisco said-- You flew. That's right. Smart kid, the Duchess. Oh, I'm sorry. William, this is Patrice. I know. I scared her so, she didn't know who I was. This is my-- Heavens, the baby. I left the baby on the bed. I'll go. Hey, when am I gonna see my nephew? Soon. I'll never get away with it. Never. Never. I didn't know he had a brother. I don't know anything about him. I don't know anything about anyone. They'll find me out. They're bound to. You. You, what were you like? I've got to know. I've got to. Patrice, dear. It's Mother. May I come in? I have some things for you. Oh, he's such a good baby. You know, Hugh was always full of the devil, even when he was little. What you said tonight about wanting some pictures of Hugh as a child, well, I've kept an awful lot of things. Both boys. Father says I'm sentimental, but now I'm glad I was. These all belonged to Hugh. He used to write such funny letters from college. I can remember one... Well, anyway, there they all are. Keep what you want of them. The boy might like them, when he's old. Good night, dear. You were a nice guy, Hugh. I'm glad I brought you here. Name this child. Hugh Donald Harkness. Hugh Donald, I baptize thee in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost, Amen. You have a name. You have a name. We receive this child into the congregation of Christ's flock and do sign him with the sign of the cross, in token that hereafter, he shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified, and, manfully, to fight under his banner... And Patrice was so worried when the baby's hair started to fall out. Well, I didn't know it was supposed to. I didn't either. - Of course. - William was bald for months. Please, Duchess. She's referring to the nude study of me on the bearskin rug. The best pie you ever made, Grace. - It certainly is. - I wish I could cook. Well, nonsense. I didn't make that pie, Josie did. Don't you let her tell you them fibs, Mr. Donald. - She knows she ain't suppose-- - Isn't. Isn't supposed to be messing around the hot stove. - Josie. - I can't do nothing with her. She-- Do I smell something burning? No, ma'am, you don't. With pumpkin as expensive as it is, you're lucky to have any pie at all. Okay, Duchess. Next spring, we'll put in the victory gardenagain. Don't let anyone tell you how cheap Europe is. I used to think San Francisco was expensive, but-- San Francisco, dear? I didn't know you ever lived there. Hugh told us you were raised in, um... Uh, were you born in San Francisco, Patrice? No. How about some music? I believe I am in the mood. So am I. Something nice and sentimental. Well, if we're all finished, why not take our coffee in the other room? Isn't it a pity it's so old-fashioned to be sentimental? I don't mind being sentimental today. Play Hugh's song for me, will you? Hand tied behind my back. The same way you play golf, eh? That's lovely. I don't think I ever heard it before. You should have. William. Don't worry, Patrice. We understand. It's a wonder you remember anything after what you've been through. I shouldn't have asked William to play that. It was Hugh's favorite tune. You're all very kind. So that's why they've never questioned my mistakes. Patrice! Hello, Bill. Hiya. You buying up the town? No, just picking up some yarn for Mother. I have a hunch it's going to wind up in a sweater. Do you like blue? Oh, I never wear anything else. Hm. Come on, I'll walk with you. What are you doing out of the office? Someday you'll find out how smart I am. I always manage to get in Dad's way when he's looking for somebody to do some legwork. Smart, huh? Oh, those are nice. Aha. What are they? Oh, you know darn well what they are. Don't be so superior. Mm. Is this what they call window-shopping? Mm-hm. This is what is called window-shopping. Fun. You don't get anywhere, but you see a lot. Hey, there's an idea. I've been wondering what to get for Dad. Come on in and help me pick one out. Oh, I don't know anything about pens. Oh, come on. I have no sales resistance when I'm alone. Patrice. How do you like the way this one writes? Here, let me try it again. I'm not completely sold on that. Let me take a look at this one over here. Yes, that'll do. Charge it and send it over to my office. Certainly, Mr. Harkness. Shall I gift wrap it? No, don't bother. Well, maybe you'd better at that. Come on, Patrice. How do you do? Can I show you something? Cigarette lighters. Gold. I ran into Patrice downtown today. Yeah? Yeah. Something funny happened. What? You know that sweet child went all the way to Bloomers to pick up some yarn for me today? I'm making her a sweater for Christmas. Do you think she'll like blue? You like her, don't you, Duchess? I just hope when you marry, you'll bring home somebody half as nice. Why, the way Patrice is taking hold, she'll know how to run this house better than I do in another month. Just you do as well as your brother did, and I'll be happy. Oh, Josie, I'll take that up. You shouldn't be climbing them stairs too much. You're getting too old. She's three years older than I am. It's too hot. It'll be cold by the time you get up there with it. You were gonna tell me something that happened today. Oh, was I? I guess I must have forgotten what it was. You're getting as bad as your mother. Yeah. I guess I am. And Santa Claus will come down the chimney with presents for everybody. And in the morning when you wake up, there'll be a great big Christmas tree. Do you know something? This will be your mother's first Christmas like that too. Heh. Come on, let's say good night to Grandma and Grandpa. Oh, I'm sorry. - Come in, Patrice. - We were just going to call you. Sit down. This is something that concerns you. Did I cover it all right? That's the way you want it, Willie? Yes, as long as you're sure there can't be any hitch. Listen, you young squirt. When there's a hitch in any legal document that I draw up, your father can get a new lawyer. That'd be a little late, wouldn't it? Now listen, you-- Now, now, now, you two. That baby has to get some sleep. - All right. - Ready for me to sign? Shouldn't you tell Patrice about it first? Well, you see, Patrice, this-- Donald's changing the provisions of his will by adding a codicil. In the original will, after Grace was provided for, there was a division of the residue made between Bill and your late husband. We're altering that by making it one-quarter to Bill and three-quarters to you. Now, don't look that way about it. You're not doing anyone out of anything. Willie will have the business. No. No, don't put my name in it. I don't want my name in it. I don't want any money. Oh, Dad, won't you listen to me? It's on Hugh's account, dear. Don't you understand? We all feel bad about Hugh, Grace, but Patrice has to go on living. She has a child to think of. These things shouldn't be postponed because of sentiment. They have to be taken care of at the right time. No. Please, no. Sign it, Dad. I want you to. He signed it after you left. Ty took it back with him. It's done, Patrice, whether you wanted it or not. I just wanted you to know that I'm glad you acted the way you did. You wanna shake hands good night? Good night. Happy New Year! - Come and listen. - It's wonderful. * And never brought To mind? * Can you hear it? Yes. Happy New Year, Patrice. Thank you, and you. We should thank you, dear. * For auld lang syne * Happy New Year, Bill. * For auld lang syne * Happy New Year, Patrice. * We'll take a cup O' kindness yet * * For auld lang syne * Donald, it's too cold for you out here. Go inside before you get pneumonia. I'll never get pneumonia. You'll get worse than pneumonia if you don't stop being so thickheaded. I guess you know how I feel. Bill, please, not now. Why not now? You don't think I like it, do you? I've been fighting it for weeks. I guess I've never really been in love before. Oh, no. Don't say it. Don't you understand? I have to say it. If you're worrying about what people will think, that you were Hugh's wife, well, don't. I don't. Not anymore. I love you. Is that so terrible? No. No, it's beautiful. You're so good, so kind. You deserve the best there is. I-- I think I have the best there is. Give me a little more time. All right. I won't rush you. That's not what I'm afraid of. That's all of them. Give a yell when you want the lights to come down. I'll be in the library with Dad. Don't strain yourself, Duchess. This is an old one, isn't it? Oh. That was on our first Christmas tree. William was 6 months old. Huey wasn't even born yet. I blame Dad and myself for not making more over William. Huey was the impetuous one. If there was a fence to go over, William climbed it. Huey jumped over it. He was always the one with the skinned knees. I think that's why I made over him more. I think William's going to make some woman a wonderful husband, don't you? Yes, he will. Let one of the men go. I'll get it, Josie. Merry Christmas. Lots of girls have set their caps for William. You wouldn't think so. He goes out so seldom. It's for you, Patrice. Thank you. Last year, a girl named Peggy Crandall was bound and determined to marry him. Really, I was so amused. She even started to make over me. Now, wasn't that silly? I do think that was pretty out-- Patrice. Patrice, what is it? - Oh, I got a little dizzy. - It's nothing to worry about. Oh, you scared me. I'm sorry about the ornaments. I'd better take a look at the baby. I'll call Bill. "Who are you? Where did you come from? "What are you doing there?" What are you doing there? What are you doing there? What are you doing there? Only thing for you. Just for you. I'll be right back. What brought it on? Some shock. Her heart's always been weak. Even before you and Hugh were born. I never realized it. She didn't want you to. How bad is it, doc? Things like that don't improve as we get on in years. I thought that that baby pulled her through last time. Maybe it will again. But no excitement. No stress of any kind. Understand? So don't tell her or let her know that you found out how serious it is. Okay. Let her think it's her secret and mine. She'll be happier that way. I'll try and have a nurse here in the morning. Bill, why didn't you call me? There's nothing you can do, Patrice. Where's Dad? With Mother. Come on, help me get him to bed. Dad. Please go to bed. I'll stay with her. I'm all right. Please, darling. I'll call you if she needs you. Come on, Dad. Tom says she's all right. "To Mother from the four of us." Here she comes. Really, Pat, I can walk. Not up and down the stairs. There. You did it perfectly. Oh. Thanks to you, dear. I don't know what I'd do without you. You, uh, sure you should have tried this, Grace? I should have tried it a week ago. Oh, for me? Oh, aren't they pretty. - Now, come on. - Don't stand there. Your legs are too wobbly. Josie, the way you carry on. Anybody'd think I'd been really sick. No, I don't need this. Don't argue with me. Oh, that child's wearing herself out, racing me to the door every time it rings. Answering the telephone every time there's a call. Mrs. Patrice Harkness? Yes. Telegram. Sign here. Patrice, what is it? Bill. Well, will you? No. It's high time you got out of this house and started going round. I can't. The baby-- Josie will take care of him. Well, I have-- I haven't anything to wear. That little white dress will do nicely. William will buy you a big orchid and that'll fix it up. Now, run along. Skedaddle, shoo. Your father and I want to be alone for a change. Thanks, Duchess. - Jack? - How do you do? Harry. John. My sister-in-law, Patrice. How do you do? I'll never remember all you names. You won't want to when you know us better. You come sit down. We've all been so anxious to meet you. Pat, sit down. Sit here, won't you? Thank you. Uh, Jack, uh, go find the waiter and buy them a drink. Oh, oh, sure. Here, Mrs. Harkness. Take this one. I think it's Mary's, but she's had enough. Oh, no, thanks. No, no, no. Go right ahead. I'll find that darn waiter soon. Henry? - You like golf? - Henry? We've got a nice course. I'm sorry, I don't know anything about it. I'll teach you come spring. Take my advice and don't do it. How about coming to lunch next week? Oh, I'd love to, only Mother hasn't been well. And the baby-- Bring him along. I've got two. And besides, I can probably bribe the nurse to stay an extra week. She's got her eye on a new hat of mine. Are you girls free Wednesday? I can make it Wednesday. You should have an appointment, but I think I can break it. Shall we dance? Hadn't you better ask one of the others? I'd like to dance with you. - What time? - Twelve-thirty? Anybody wearing a hat? They're nice. You'd better like them. You don't see a lot of them. Can I cut in on this one? Morley's the name. Stephen Morley. Mr. Morley, Mrs. Harkness. May I? We've met before. Haven't we? Who did you say you are? Too warm for you? My fault, I'm afraid. The porch, outside. No, I can't. You don't understand. I think I do. I understand you and you understand me. Better than any two people in this room. Come on. What are you doing here? Well, for that matter, what are you doing here yourself, Helen? Steve, please. Oh, I beg your pardon. What did he say your name is? Oh, yes. Missus. Mrs. Harkness. Funny, I always thought your name was Helen Ferguson. What do you want? Can't a man show a little interest in his child? He's not your child. Not anymore. Once he might have been, but you lost that chance. Now he's all mine. No way I'm making father. That you know. You're insane. We haven't finished yet. I think we have. The decision is mine. A few things you ought to get straight. For instance, Hugh Harkness married a certain Patrice Willis in Paris a year ago, June 15th. But you were living in a flat in San Francisco, June 15th a year ago. I know because I was... Shall I say, around most of the time. Just to be sure I was straight on my dates, I went back out there. The manager remembered me. Very well. She even gave me copies of your rent receipts. Better hold on to something. You don't seem very steady on your feet. I wouldn't like to have to carry you inside in front of all those people. What do you want from me? Nothing. I don't want you to do a thing. Just keep on the way you have been. Then why did you come here? Curiosity. When I read about the wreck, I went down to identify you. Only you weren't there. Someone else was. I identified that someone as you. Then I went to work to find out what happened to you. And who was taking your place in the morgue. And to find out what there was in it for you. You haven't changed any. No, but you have, haven't you? Quite a bit. Steve, answer me. What do you want? I don't know yet. Of course, if you care to do me a favor, all this investigating has been kind of expensive. That's blackmail. You always did overdramatize things. Let's say, you're just taking out insurance. I haven't any money. Not the kind you want. No? No. But your adopted family has. Do you think I'd ask them for money for you? You don't ask. You're a woman, aren't you? Use your head. No. No, I won't do it. The kid would have a pretty rough time if I had to take care of him. Better think it over. Where can I get in touch with you? Seneca 382. That right? Thanks for letting me cut in. You'll be hearing from me, Mrs. Harkness. There now. That-- Oh. Uh-huh. Now, let Granny clean you up. Oh, he's a mess. Tsk, tsk. Oh, let Josie do that. If you could see your color next to this child's. If that's Cora Johnston tell her I'm fine and hang up. She'll talk your arm off. Hello? Hiya, sweetheart. Oh, good morning. Glad you think so. It's Harriett Olson. I met her last night. How nice of her to call. Give her my love. I gather you're not alone. I also gather you haven't done anything about that little financial matter I mentioned last night. No, I haven't. There hasn't been a minute. Well, look if you have any screwy idea I was kidding, you'd better get it out of your mind quick. Yes, I will. It was a lovely party, wasn't it? Now, cut the stalling and get me some dough. I wanna get out of this whistle stop. There's a train at 7:30 tonight. I'll try. But I don't know how. There are so many things-- If you're worrying about the baby, Josie's perfectly capable of taking care of him. So you run along and do whatever it is she wants you to do. Very well. Yes. Seven-fifteen. I'll be in the waiting room. But if you don't show up, I don't take the train. Is that clear, Mrs. Harkness? Yes. Bye. - No, no, no, young man. - You'll fall off. Then you'll be just like Humpty Dumpty, all smashed up. And all the king's horses and all the king's men wouldn't be able to put you together again. Then what would poor Granny do, hm? Hm? You'll like Harriett. She's nice. Yes, she seemed very nice. She had on such a pretty dress last night and I admired it. She wanted me to meet her salesgirl. She says she's very clever. Well, you should. You need some new clothes. Well, I haven't, uh... You see, I don't like to use your charge accounts. That is not without your permission. Pat, you mean to say Father hasn't opened a bank account for you? Well, I hated to mention it. Oh, bring me that phone. Honestly, men can be the most thoughtless creatures sometimes. Oh, Pat, dear, I'm so sorry. You must have felt like a charity patient. You, you go and get your things on, and I'll, I'll tell Donald to meet you at the bank. Then you can go out and buy whatever you want. - Miss Goodness. - This is Mrs. Harkness. Oh, I'm much better, thank you. May I speak to my husband? Cutting it kind of short, aren't you? I couldn't leave until the baby was asleep. Here. February 15th if you're trying to remember the date. I wish I could forget it. Make it for 500 dollars. Five hundred? Yeah. Surprised it isn't more? Knowing you? Yes. You forgot the name. It's Stephen Morley. No. I can't do that. Why not? It's my name. Not one I picked up, Patrice. But both our names are on it and-- It'll be evidence that I blackmailed you when it clears the bank? I'm not worried. I'll be a thousand miles away. Come on, or do you want me to miss the train? All aboard! Board! Better hurry. Thanks. That's all I wanted. You taking this train, mister? No. Steve, you promised. You said-- You didn't really think I was interested in 500 dollars, did you? Oh, Steve, please. I'll give you everything they've given me, 5,000 dollars. I don't wanna be given anything. I want it to belong to me legally. Stop talking riddles. I can't stand this. It's no riddle. The old lady's life is hanging by a thread and the old man won't last any time after. Old people. I know the type. When they die, you hit the jackpot. And since the law gives the husband one-third of his wife's property, you and I are gonna be married. Married? Yeah. Married. We're going across the state line right now. I got it fixed with a justice of the peace. I wouldn't marry you. Why, I thought that's what you always wanted. The time is past for that and you know it. Suit yourself. What are you doing with that check? San Francisco rent receipts. Copy of a Paris wedding license and a check for 500 dollars. The old man's not dumb. He'll figure it out. Even you wouldn't dare. Wouldn't I? Steve. No, Steve. No. You'll kill him, do you hear me? You'll kill them. They worship your son. They think he's their grandchild. Right or wrong, they think he's their grandchild. You'll kill them, Steve. You'll kill them. They're gonna die some time. Now, let's stop the stalling. You gonna marry me or do I mail this letter? I'll marry. Looks like they've gone to bed. I couldn't get away, he'd follow me. He'll never let go of me. Never. Never. Never. Pa and me was locking up the back of the house. - Sorry. We were delayed. - We'll be right in. Come on, Helen. I can't do it. We've been all over this. I... I can't do it. Let me clear up one thing for you. I don't want you. I just want what eventually comes with you. I'm dumping you on the steps of your loving family as soon as this is over, but you're gonna marry me and it's gonna be a marriage that sticks. It's gonna stick to the bitter end. I can't do it. Look, I'm not gonna drag you in there. You're gonna walk. If you don't, I'm going in and call the Harkness house and tell them the whole story. They can have you after that, if they still want you. I-- Take a good look at me. Do I look like I'm kidding? May I use your phone for a minute? I wanna get Caulfield, Illinois. The number is Seneca 382. I'll hold it. Steve, don't. Oh, Steve, please. I'll give you everything I get. I'll sign an agreement giving you everything I get. Only don't make me do this. Please. - Please. - Don't make me do this. How do you think I'll explain a thing like that, you fool. People don't give away that kind of jack without a reason Operator. Operator. No! All right. Hello? Hello? Operator. Operator. I've been cut off. Opera-- William. William! What's the matter, Mother? William, something's happened to Patrice. When? Where? I don't know. Just now I heard her on the phone. She was pleading with some man. Now, take it easy, darling. Tell me exactly what you heard. Dad! Come on! We need you. And then the man-- Steve was his name. Yes, that's it. She called him Steve. Steve? She doesn't know anybody named Steve here-- Yes, she does. The guy at the club last night. Steve... Steve Morley. Do you, Stephen Morley, take this woman as your lawfully wedded wife? To live together... Take it easy, Mother. We'll find out where it came from. Operator. Operator. Oh, we've got to help her, William. She sounded so desperate. We will, Mother. We've gotta find-- Hello, operator? This is Seneca 382. I was disconnected from a long distance call. Do you, Patrice Harkness, take this man as your lawfully wedded husband? To live together in the state of matrimony... It won't stop here. It won't stop here. He won't leave us alone. He'll never leave us alone. He'll want more, more, more, more. ...as long as you both shall live? "As long as you both shall live." "As long as you both shall live." I said do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? "As long as..." I will. Will you give this ring as a symbol of your affections, - sincerity and fidelity? - I will. Will you receive this ring and wear it as a symbol of your affection, sincerity and fidelity? Yes. Well, can't you cut in, operator? It's busy. I know all that, operator, but this is urgent. For as you both have consented in wedlock and have acknowledged it before this company... Will you give me that again? 413 Elm Street. Yeah. Yeah, I'd appreciate it. Thanks. I hate to leave you alone, Mother. You sure you'll be all right? Of course, I will. Father and Josie will be home soon, only hurry. The operator'll call back if they get the phone fixed. Where do you live? Look, don't get any funny ideas. This wedding stopped when that bird said we were man and wife. I've got to know how to find you in case anything happens. Nothing's gonna go wrong. If it should. Right now, in my office. 1401 North 8th. But I'm moving in the morning. Since I've married money, I'm gonna get myself a place with class. Some place out in your neighborhood, for instance, where I can keep an eye on the kid. Good night, Mrs. Morley. Information? You have a Stephen Morley listed? No, I don't know the address. Patrice. Patrice. Patrice. Drive down North 8th. Kind of deserted down there this time of night. Oh, God. Oh, God. Steve. Get up, Steve. Get up. I don't wanna kill you lying down. This is Radio Station WXYR, Caulfield, Illinois, concluding another 18 hours of broadcasting activity. This Johnny... Steve. No. - Let me in. Let me in. - Do you hear me? No, no. Bill, don't come in. What are you doing here? Answer me. Bill, why did you come? Trying to get you out of whatever this mess is. Answer me. Why are you here? He's dead. I was gonna kill him, but somebody-- Oh, Bill, you-- You didn't. Listen to me you little fool. It doesn't matter who killed him right now. Has he anything of yours? Anything that connects you with him? Well-- A check. I gave him a check tonight for 500 dollars. What'd he do with it? He put it in an envelope to mail to your father. Did he? No. No. I married him. That was his price, Bill. Have you got the wedding license? No. He has it. He kept it after. Anything else? Think. Think hard. Well, a little black book. It has our phone number in it. That's all. You're sure? Letters? No. Did you ever write to him? No. No, never. Pull yourself together. We've gotta get out of here. Quick. Get home the best way you can. I have to keep the car. What are you going to do? Clean up this mess, get rid of him. Bill, they'll catch you. Patrice, get this through your head. I've gotta keep your name out of this. If he's found here, the whole thing will come out. If he's found far away, they may never connect him with this room. He's a stranger. There's nobody to inquire. If they should, if they find-- It's a chance we've gotta take. Now, shut up and get out before somebody comes. No. Bill, no. I'll do anything you want, but I won't leave you alone. All right. Here. I haven't time to argue. Get the car. It's around the corner. When you see me come out, bring it up to the door. But if you see or hear anybody, keep going. The door. Open the door. Get in back. I'll drive. I told you to go home. I'm sorry. I'll be all right in a minute. Take it easy. We've been lucky so far. Did you find the letter? Yeah. Everything but the check. It's gone. We'll worry about it when the time comes. There's only one bullet hole in him. I didn't kill him, Bill. He was dead. I know he was. He was staring at me and I suddenly realized he was dead, but I couldn't stop. I fired the gun and he just kept staring at me. His expression never changed. I-- You've got to believe me, Bill. You've got to believe me. It doesn't matter, Pat. Not to me. What is it? Listen. Hear it? Stay here. If anybody comes, duck down in the bottom. It's a slow freight. Outbound. I think they're empty and it's coming at a crawl. No initials. Do you want me to--? No. Just watch for anybody coming. Bill. Get down. Unit 4. Three twenty-two South Oak Street. Unit 4. Three twenty-two South Oak street. See the woman about a prowler. Unit 2. First and Main. Unit 2 at 1 and Main. Investigate a disturbance. It's not in the five column. That's stolen, I guess. Better call out a wreckers and I'll take a look. Unit 3. Calling headquarters. Come in. Go ahead unit 3. Hold it. Attention all units. Officer needs help. Shooting at 3rd and Washington. Come on. We got a hot one. Attention all units. Officer needs help. Shooting at 3rd and Washington. They're gone. He stayed on. Caught on the catwalk or whatever it is. But his head didn't. It came off. Oh. Bill? Yes, Patrice? You know, don't you? That you're not Patrice. That you're not Hugh's wife? I think I've known that almost from the beginning. And you never said anything. I was afraid I'd lose you. That you'd walk out. Oh, Bill. Listen, Patrice. Don't call me that. Everything you call me that, it's a lie. No, it isn't. It is. It is. I'm not Patrice. I'm an imposter. A low-- Listen to me. I don't care who you were and what you've done. I love you. Don't you understand? I love you. Not a name. No, you can't. Not when you know. I don't wanna know. I don't care. As far as I'm concerned, you were born the day I met you. What happened before that doesn't exist. The name of the girl I love is Patrice. She has no other name. Oh, my darling, can't you see? The things I've done. Steve. The things you did for me tonight. No matter how much you love me, no matter how much I love you, it will always be there like a-- Like a sword hanging over us ready to drop. We'd never forget. We've got to. Mother. She's gone, Bill. God forgive me. Yes? I heard you and Mr. William talking. The police are coming now? Yes. For three months I've been watching and waiting. I wasn't to give you this unless they came. What is it? Mrs. Harkness wrote it the night she died. When I got home from my sister's, I went up to see if there's anything she would be wanting. She was lying on the floor with her hat and coat on. I wanted to get her to bed, but she insisted upon writing that letter first. Made me swear on the Bible I'd let nothing happen to it. Then she sort of crumpled up. Bill. Oh, Bill. Bill. Pat, what is it? I, Grace Bennett Harkness, knowing I'm about to die, wish to make the following confession. That on the night of February 15th, of this year, 1949, I shot and killed Stephen Morley. She couldn't have. I cannot condone or justify this crime. For those who doubt my ability to carry out this deed, I can only answer that one calls upon great resources of strength when the happiness of those one loves is in jeopardy. Where did you get this? Josie. Your mother told her to give it to me if the poli-- Oh, Bill, she didn't do it. She couldn't have. She's only trying to protect us. What are you going to do? Give it to them. That's what she wanted. No. No. I've got to. It's our only chance. Do you think I'll let you do that to the woman who took me in? Gave me a home? To the only real mother I ever had? Patrice, I love my mother. I loved her as much as any man can love his mother. But when I married you, I said, "Forsaking all others." And I meant it. Bill, please, don't give it to them. - Mr. Harkness? - Yes? I'd like to speak to Mrs. Harkness. Come in. Mrs. Patrice Harkness. I'm Patrice Harkness. You recognize this check? Yes. Would you mind telling us what it was for? He was hounding her to collect a debt of my brother's. She paid it. Why? Steve Morley was found murdered three months ago on a railroad ditch about 200 miles from here. We had a hard time finding out who he was at first, but he finally connected up with a room over on 8th Street. The landlord identified him. We'd about given up when this check turned up and broke the case, Mrs. Harkness. She had nothing to do with his death. My-- He's wrong. I did kill Stephen Morley. Pat. I went to his room. He was lying on the bed, I-- I shot him. I see. You speak to him first? I told him to get up. Did he answer you? No. He just stared at me. Well, that clears up a couple of things we've been puzzling about. What kind of a gun did you use? A .38. We found a bullet from a .38 in the mattress. But Morley was killed by a .32. We got the gun. Raided a gambling joint and found this check and a .32 on one of the shills. Finally broke down and made a full confession. Out in the car now. Come down to the DA's office tomorrow morning 10 o'clock. Both of you. You can make full statements of your part in this case then. In the meantime, don't try to leave town. Good night. Oh, Bill. Bill. You know, from what we've dug up about this Morley, he must have made a lot of people wanna kill him. He was quite a guy. He was a skunk. You ought to know, sister. You killed him. The house we live in is so beautiful. What stood between us is gone now. Whatever comes, we can face together.
