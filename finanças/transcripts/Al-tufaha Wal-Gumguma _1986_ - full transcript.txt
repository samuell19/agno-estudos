I doubt that this story will reach anyone I'm writing this on the back of a checkbook, I will be putting it in a jar and throw it into the wide sea And waves will carry it to where destiny decides An explosion happened aboard our ship and everyone were jumping into water And just before the ship sank to the bottom of the sea, I jumped holding my nose with my hand and shutting my eyes And while anticipating the moment I will hit the water; I suddenly remembered I can't swim! My body hit the water and I tried grasping for anything that would float Until I grasped something very soft, the softest thing I ever touched And a soft voice called to me: ''hold onto the board, don't pull me down And in a few minutes the wooden board drifted away from the sinking ship And I finally managed to see the face of my savior who I recognised Aren't you Aziza Fahmi the movie star? My name is Zaza, and you? Ahmed AbdoulGhfar, the first engineer of the ship Nice to meet you, you must be the one who built it! You have great since of humor, by the way thanks for saving my life No need to thank me, it's my job! Do you know, we are like two ants drowning in a glass of water! Is that supposed to be a joke? -No it's philosophy Stop philosophizing and kick harder to move the board Do you know where we are heading? Did you hear that? -I heard a bird A bird? -Yes Where? There It's land, I swear it is! It's land! I will work as a plumber, a doorman, anything Just no more sea, I swear -Kick harder! I'm kicking Zaza Zaza -Stay where you are! I am drying my clothes I need you to hold the mirror for me Come! Hold this Where did you find this? -It's mine And the brush? -Also mine You brought them before you jumped ship?! You think I'm crazy to leave the ship without a mirror and a brush? And nail polish too? Nail polish, powder, lipstick and everything Hold the mirror straight don't shake it Ironic that this island is too small, with only us here. Damn it! We are all alone? All alone, except for some dead people What? Dead people?! Yes but long since dead, only skeletons are left And I think there was a woman among them And how did you know she was a woman? -I found her bracelet! What?! You're wearing a dead woman's bracelet? They died long ago! Hold the mirror straight! Don't shake it! Did you check out this cabin? -Yes, it's empty Give me the mirror What's wrong? Why has your jaw dropped open? Were you afraid I'd see you without that thing on?! Come I will show you the island What's that? Is it drinkable water? Of course, it's so fresh! Come and drink I want to Strange, a small island in the middle of the sea and the ground water is unsalted Wonderful! Come and see these dead people! Oh my god! I want to put this skull upright Why? I don't like it while the nose is in the sand! And did he tell you he can't breath?! Oh my god! It's really sweet, do you think it was a woman or a man? Who cares, dead is dead male or female I think it was a man Why? -It's a big skull dosen't look feminine! Please let's go, I'm getting goose pimples! Coward! What do you like in this? -What's wrong with it? It's the sweetest apple I ever tested How come theres apples in summer? Maybe they're summer apples! I never seen an apple tree so short Are you always like this? Like what? You see everything as strange Give your mind a break! You're right Do you know what we are like ? Again! Like two people in a fairytale, a sinking ship, a small island and a boy and a girl all alone What's the name of your perfume? Mystery Let me show you the cabin! -That's what I really want! Come What do you think? Great! A bed! And it's made of wood I wonder if it's strong enough for both of us It's strong enough for you alone! I can't, I'm out of breath What the name of that perfume again? Mystery Zaza! Thank God you're safe, I thought you drowned Zaza -Welcome back Toto Poor baby, you've been in the water for that long? Come, I will introduce you Ahmed, Toto Nice to meet you Mr. Toto! Welcome What? Can't he talk? -Yes, but in a strange language And where's he from? -I don't know, he didn't tell me And did you try to talk to him in English? Of course I tried English, French, Italian All the languages! Then how do you know his name is Toto? I named him Toto! -Zaza! You mean you can't talk with each other? We don't need to talk together! And where did you meet him? I met him on the ship My poor Toto you must be very tired Zaza Why are you laughing? Whenever you touch him he says Zaza! He is like a doll that speaks when you tab their belly! Zaza! -You see?! Oh, he is so sweet He must be hungry Right Toto? Zaza! -Come with me Don't you have no shame?! And what do you care? What do you mean what do I care? Are you my father, brother, husband? Are you my guardian? No but a while ago you and me were ..you know! Come with me Toto I will show you the island Come here you are going nowhere with him! Zaza! -Toto no, come with me Come join us! Fish?! Where from? I have Toto! Zaza! He caught it? And he's made a fire He did it all while you were snoring there! Is that all that he done while I was asleep?! Great, it smells so delicious! He is a resourceful man, right Toto? Zaza Great we eat fish and apples for desert, it can't be better! Come and eat, are you waiting for an invitation? I won't sell my dignity for a meal of fish! Fine, I'll have yours It's so delicious, really great! Do you want your fish or should I eat it? Of course I'll eat it. And where's your dignity?! Fish doesn't effect one's dignity when roasted! Tell me: why do you hate Toto? Why did he had to come out of the sea at that moment?! It's OK I will make peace between you two Food makes me sleepy Did I sleep for long? -Not really. Hiw long you been sitting there? Also not long. I want to drink Here you go Who put the dagger there? Me Why? Drink! You are a strange person -You mean a noble person Did you eat your fish? -Yes Why didn't you leave some for me? I'm sorry, I was very hungry I love you Zaza Toto woke up! Thank God a thousand times! Salam Alikum Alikum Salam Thank God you're safe What resort is this? Did I say something funny! Not at all, it's no a resort, it's just an island An island?! And what do you do here if I may ask? We were aboard the sinking ship, I think you were too Right I'm Ahmed AbdoulGhfar, the first engineer of the ship Nice to meet you I'm Haj Tolba Hasaneen, a junk merchant And him?

Of course, but we forgot to bring our bags! hey Kersha, take off your robe What? I said take off your robe My robe? -Give it to the lady to wear Take this, when it's dry let the lady wear it How can I wear this? It's better than parading naked in front of these men Mister, is there's any water to drink? We filled this jar from the well it's not salted After you Haj Damn it, everything is wet even my checkbook Thank God the water didn't spoil it If I may ask, do you always carry a gun? My job requires it. Kersha, give me an apple I don't think that this cabin is big enough for all of us I wish it was just big enough for me and my wife But the weather is warm and we can take turns sleeping in it. Me and my wife a night and you the next Of course not, God forbid the lady sleeps in the open and the men inside?! Zaza Zaza This guy is so funny! It's getting dark, we all should rest Tell me what direction is Mecca? This is the west, Mecca is this way Let's go Zaza, Good night Good night I said you're my wife because .. -Because you're a bastard! You're the meanest bastard I've ever seen! I just wanted to give you protection so no one will bother you And who told you that I need protection? And even if I needed it, why didn't you say I'm Toto's wife? Are you stronger than him? Of course not but I have can speak! Stay away from me! I bet you're not really angry I will never put this on! Please the guy can't control himself when looking at you He is smug! And you are a smug too! But you know, there's something attractive about him! Really?! Why don't you say that Kersha has something attractive too?! Of course he does! Every man has something! Really?!! This bed is too hard The ground is more comfortable! Of course the ground is more comfortable Now please turn the other way and go to sleep I love you Zaza -Shove it!

Yes, what can I do for you? -Sorry Mr Ahmed, I.. I .. It seems that I caught a cold from staying at sea for so long And what can I do for you now? Can't you understand? He should sleep with you inside How can I let a strange man in my wife's bedroom?! Sorry Mr, I had a pneumonia a few months ago and if I stay out in the cold it may kill me God forbid Haj, may the one who hates you get it! We can put the bed on its side to divide the cabin And we can also use kersha's jalabiya as a curtain Anyways, it's up to you.. What do you mean up to him?! Is it a house his father left him?! Did he build it? No please behave yourself! -How dare you You behave yourself! You're talking to the boss! If it wasn't for his kind heart he would throw you out on your ass! Enough Kersha I swear I would've taught him a lesson Zaza, let's leave this place -OK Where are you going? We will sleep outside -How come? Would I throw a man and his wife out of their home?! I won't have it! It's OK, when you feel better we go back to our home Come on Mr. Ahmed, why are you so stubborn? If you will sleep out I must pay you rent Is 100 pounds enough? It's a cabin by the sea Where can you find another cabin Make it 1000! A thousand?! Is this a furnished villa? It's an empty miserable cabin Even though I want you to be happy, I will make it 200 To compensate you and your lady for sleeping outdoors Keep your money Haj! Come on take it, be smart we won't stay here forever A ship will pass and pick us up soon Let's go Why are you laughing? At you! If Kersha got you he would squash you! You're making fun of me?! -Do you want me to praise you? Is love just words? A man is supposed to protect me! A man uses his brain not just his muscles! I'm sorry Ahmed, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings A woman needs to feel safe for her love to grow Come on smile now Now give me a smile Or should I go and search for Toto?! What are you doing?! You're not alone on this island Behave yourself! You come to stand next to us and say you're not alone?! I will stand where I like! Let's go Zaza Where you going? Toto! It seems they are fighting! They are killing each other! I hope so! Why're you standing here? go and stop them Me? - Who then? Me? No chance! I'm afraid to get hurt just watching! Go and help Toto I don't think he needs any help Do you call yourself a man? I prefer to keep my manhood for things better than fighting! Are you crazy? We don't want trouble I swear I will kill him! Give me this dagger, I said give me the dagger! What's going on here? It's all because of this cuckold, I woke up to see this boy kissing her Yes I saw him kissing her, it's this asshole's fault He is standing like a sissy Is this true, lady? True or not this doesn't concern you! -Is that so?! Yes it's so And you? What do you say about this? Now calm down, Haj -I'm calm I lied when I said that Zaza is my wife The truth is she is not my wife nor I'm her husband! Not her husband and she's not your wife?! Then why did you two sleep alone in the cabin? Take it easy Haj, it's a deserted island You're a degenerate! -No! behave yourself! Really?! You made a fool of me and you say behave yourself! Who do you think I am, do you think I'm a pimp? God forbid Haj I know I was wrong, from now on Zaza is a free woman You girl! -Don't call me girl! You rude ignoramus! I'm a lady, a respectful lady! Behave yourself! You're a brute! How can you hit a lady? Why did you hit her? You have no right to judge her! Careful how you talk to Haj, you fucker You filthy dogs, I swear if someone comes near her I will use this! Kersha, take the check from him Give it to me, God dam you And did you have to kiss her!? How did these fish bones get here? -I don't know, Haj Where's that engineer boy? He is sitting there beside the dead Go and bring him here Whatever you say, Haj Hey, come and talk with the Haj Didn't you hear me?! What do you want from me? -Come talk to the Haj I don't talk to no one! What do you mean?! I said you will talk to him! OK, OK I will talk to him! Good morning mister -Good morning I know you're angry with me, it's OK, I'm sorry You did me wrong and I did you wrong, we should just forgive each other It's OK, It's all over Tell me mister, where did the fish bones came from? From the fish we ate yesterday And where did that fish come from? From the sea! I know it's from the sea, but who fished it? Toto And how did he fish it? With this dagger Kersha boy, go and catch two fishes for us Two fishes?! Catch them with what? Use this dagger And does this dagger catch fish? -Toto did it. Are you as bright as he? I never heard of people fishing with a dagger Just go and try OK Why aren't you wearing the jalabiya? Listen to me if you want to stay naked you must stay inside the cabin I'm a righteous man! Go inside Not one fish wants to be caught! You're good for nothing It's not my fault, how can you can fish with a dagger? Well, how did he do it? Because he is son of a Jinn! Why don't you tell him to catch some fish for us You beat him up yesterday and now you want him to fish for you?! Just talk to him, he may agree, I will pay him Do you have money? I will write him a cheque I don't know if Toto accepts cheques Why pay him? He will eat with us! Yes but if he does all the work he should get paid Please talk to him, is 20 pounds enough? 20 pounds! That will buy a 100 kilos! Shut up, I will give him 20 pounds! Here you go OK, clean my glasses while waiting! Try not to break them Toto, this is a 20 pounds cheque Why don't you take it and go catch some fish for us? Take it We want to eat, man! We're starving! Stop chewing so loud, I'm up to here with apples! Say, why don't you talk to that woman? -Zaza? Yes, she may be able to convince him After you hit her yesterday you want her to mediate for you?! So what?! She will also eat with us, won't she? If not for free, I will pay her I can convince her but with one condition What is it? -You come with me Why? It's better you go alone -If you come it will stroke her ego Do you think so? -Of course Haj Zaza, Zaza Please open The Haj wants to ask you a favor Yes? The Haj is hungry and wants you to ask Toto to go fishing What's that to do with me? I talked to him and he refused He will listen to you, if you could try to convince him So the Haj is hungry and wants me to talk to Toto?! And why can only I convince him? Can't you convince him Mr Haj? If you won't for free I will write you a cheque. Keep your checks for yourself! You can't fool me! He wants me to convince him! Do you want an apple? -I don't want that shit! Apples are not food! If you agree I will beat him up and he will obey you like a dog After two days, you're already bored? I hope she is hungry and went to convince him It seems he is not convinced yet! I want to see how she convinces him -It seems to have worked like a charm. Kersha! Go get him! Haj, he will kill him! Toto, Toto, please no Toto please don't Stop him! Stop him! Please please don't let him kill him! Stop him I beg you Drop the knife, Kersha I said drop it! Don't come any closer! Stay back! Come on Mr Ahmed, is it your gun? Yeah, now it's mine! Don't say that, man! Give it to me Stay where you are! -Calm down, why you're so jumpy? Get back, I swear I will shoot! Should I gut him, Haj? No it's OK, he is not a bad guy, where's the gun? Too bad, I really wanted to gut him Go and tell your boy to go fishing! I swear if he doesn't go I will kill him OK Kersha, Give him the dagger Please Toto, I beg you to go for my sake Take it Go and catch some fish -For my sake Toto Go with him and learn, you idiot! Sorry Zaza, it seems I can never kill Not a ship has passed, not even one for gods sake.. Didn't you say you're a ships engineer? I think I told you so Why don't you build us a ship? Why not? tomorrow morning you will find it ready! I'm not kidding, I'm serious! And can you tell me what to build it with? Here it is, with this and some engineering it can be a boat But where's the tools? -With the dagger and some patience Some patience! -Persistence can move mountains! We are four healthy men How much do you want to build it? Ten thousand -Ten thousand?! Ten thousands pounds? This is a rip off This is my price, if you don't like it find another engineer Ahmed Yes darling You must find a way Way for what? Out of this terrible situation Don't you know a way? The problem is I don't Aren't you pretending to be a philosopher? What can philosophy can do against a gun, a dagger and a chimp? I wish if they hadn't arrived, it was a black day Yes it was, I was about to kiss you! OK, here is a cheque for 5,000 pounds My prices are fixed, I never took a job for less than 10,000 Come on man don't be greedy, you will be on board too Please don't waste your time and mine, I have other work to do I will make it seven Ten means ten! Let's make it eight 9,999 is still no! Damn it you're so stubborn! Here it is, ten thousands pounds For the first time in my life Im holding 10,000 pounds! Why this does Toto work with the dagger and I get this?! Shut up and work Kersha And you? Will you just set here and not work? Of course we all will work! Why don't you tell them what to do? If I tell them the whole plan they will not need me anymore So you're really smart! Why don't you send Toto to fish? I'm so hungry! We won't fish until the boat is done We will eat apples You continue to work, I will go pray before night falls Why dont we stop, I'm so tired and it's almost night Go to work Kersha! You will work until it's dark I think it's getting cold Tell me, how long it will take to finish it Two or three months, maybe four Or five, six, seven .. -Say eight, nine, ten .. Take this, take my place I will go do my night prayers I think it's enough, we should sleep to wake up early and continue Good night Hey you, that's enough, don't you get tired?! He is an animal! Why are you late? I was putting the kids to bed! Aren't you afraid that Tolba may see you? Of course not -If he sees you he will kill you He can't because of the boat, the worst he can do is complain And aren't you afraid to be scolded?! Any one who passes up this chance deserves to be scolded! You're crazy! I love you Zaza How about this! Now tell me how about this! Whats it got to do with you? What gives you the right to invade our privacy? Oh really?! Do you think you can bullshit me? What do you think I am? Do you think that I'm a pimp! -OK Haj I want to marry Zaza Any objections? You marry her? With which magistrate? The world didn't always have magistrates, wel write a contract and you two will be witnesses And how do we know it's valid maybe it's just a con? I said we will write a contract, a contract! Well, it's true that this girl needs a man to control her Don't call me girl! Do you think you can control her? And why not? Am I a child?! And what if that giant outside attacked her? Will you be able to stop him? Well you're here, you can stop him -Really?! That's nice You get married and I work as a bodyguard! If he attacks us I will deal with him And what if he kills you? -What do you care?! And the boat? Who will build the boat? Your life is not your own! If I don't marry her I won't build the boat Yeah really?! And the check you took? Here 's your check, it's worthless Speak politely to the Haj! - Leave him, Kersha Listen, we agree that this girl needs a man to control her Didn't you agree on this? Well I said I will control her! Don't fool yourself, you can't control her Why don't you say it clearly then?! What do you mean? Admit you want to marry her? Am I good enough for Lady Zaza?! And why should she marry someone like you How much do you make monthly? A hundred? Two hundreds? Lady Zaza needs a man of wealth A real man! To buy her clothes, shower her with gifts, pamper her! Make her live like a queen, or am I wrong lady Zaza? What?! Zaza! Say something I tell you what, let me know when you decide, I just want to get married! Didn't I tell you?

Good morning, Why are they fighting today? What do you think? They are fighting over me! Yes right, I forgot They reminds me of cats For me they reminds me of cooks Did you ever see cooks fight? -No Me neither But I think when they fight they do it like this! See how they're showing off!

Yes darling? Is that all you can say? Yes true! -Ahmed please, I'm not kidding I'm telling you I'm so scared, save me Ahmed Please hid me Hide me, my darling Ahmed, I don't know why I'm so scared Even after I've hid you? I love you so much I love you too. Ahmed! Toto, don't be crazy! Please Toto don't Toto calm down, god dam you Toto! Ahmed! Run Ahmed, run to the cabin Ahmed, run to the cabin Take it Ahmed, I loaded it, I hid the bullets Stop Toto Go back Toto or else Toto I don't want to kill you Go back Toto, I'm not the same as before I'm serious Toto don't come forward Toto I'm warning you Go back Toto please Finish him! What are you waiting for? -Should I kill you now? Should I kill you? I should kill you all! From now on you will all obey me! You will all obey me! Do you understand? I will finish you! One bullet and its over Ahmed what are you doing?! Have you become like them? I realized that power... Any power we should restrain it with love and control it with reason So the desire to kill that the smell of blood raging inside us doesn't take over our minds I didn't see Toto for the rest of the day, also Haj and Kersha were avoiding me Until it was night .. Dagger! Dagger! Oh my god! He will operate on himself! He can't leave the bullet inside But he will hurt himself! It's his choice, his wound and its his own thigh! Give me this Wait Take off you shirt Can't you see he is shaking from fever? Take, you don't deserve it Dagger, Dagger What? He wants the dagger Toto, fish Take it Fish, fish Toto is a nice guy True! Where you going? I will bring Tolba and Kersha to eat with us I can't believe the harmony that landed on this island! I hope it will continue You are right mister From now on I'm the leader here If you want to leave this island unharmed... We have to join our hands together and work hard on the boat Do you think we can really make that boat? Of course Haj, if we worked hard and stopped fighting, We can finish it in 3 or 4 weeks maximum We will still spend 3 or 4 weeks on this damned island?! Do you have a better idea?! What do you say Haj? -I say it's God's will .. And you Kersha? What else can we do? And you Toto? Arabic, Arabic, “Kersa” Kersa?! He is a funny guy! Do you know what I really want now? What? -I'm so happy that I want to dance! Do you know how to dance? -You kidding?!! OK, Toto plays music and you dance What's this stupid music?! Give us oriental please For the belly! Where are you going Haj? -This is not for me, you have fun Let's go Kersha -Please Haj let me watch As you wish, stay Thank you very much Haj Although I had the gun I still didn't feel safe from Kersha and the Haj. I needed to dismantle their front so we can build the boat without problems And so I can easily rule the island. I thought divide and conquer was best despite its immorality. But I have to do what I have to do And there's no mortals in politics anyway. I noticed that kersha has tendency to rebel, when he saw Zaza dancing He was unable to control himself and one night I got my chance .. Don't be afraid, Zaza -What do you want Kersha? Nothing -What? I'm .. -You're what? I love you Don't be afraid Kersha! -I'll be tender Please Kersha Don't scream Please Kersha I want you They are no better than me They are no better than me -No no Kersha! What are you doing you dirty dog, bastard?! Low-life savage! What are you doing?! Speak up, bastard! Enough, enough both of you We are working at the boat and you're fighting here? This is not fair I'm human flesh and blood And I'm strong as an ox! Where should spend my strength! Zaza should be for all of us! Kersha! A man can marry four wives, we can't a woman marry four men in our sorry situation? What's this bullshit, you bastard!? Haj, what Kersha said is right What do you mean right?! You atheist heretic! Listen, I won't allow for this blasphemy! Got that?! But Haj .. -You shut the fuck up! And did you forgot that lady Zaza is my wife?! But you divorced her It was in a moment of anger, it's my right to go back on it What do you mean?! I mean she is my wife again from tonight to end this farce I won't allow this! It's my legal right to go back on it after a waiting period It's not over and you're still my wife. And you will obey me liked or not, got it? I don't accept this nonsense! Shut up you whore! Stay away from Zaza, you got nothing to do with her Really?! Think you can scare me with this gun?
