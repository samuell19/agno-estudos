I'm going to kill you, because you're a fucking embarrassment. I'm ashamed to have such a dim-witted fuck for a brother. I need a fag. Fuck him. There a fire in here somewhere? You can'nae smoke in here. (LAUGHS) Don't start me, Thomas. Don't fucking start me. Well, if you ever came to chapel, you'd realize we were fully central heated now. Aye. What the fuck do you call that, then? Now give us a bunky up. Christ, haven't done this since I was an altar boy. You were never an altar boy. Thomas, you were never know an altar boy. I was an altar boy. Bloody hell, Thomas, what have you done? It wasn't my fault. It was Sheila. Where is Sheila? She wanted to go up the road. You let her go out of here by herself? She wanted to. You are supposed to be looking after her. Well, she didnae want me to. Well, I can understand, but you were supposed to be looking after her just the same. I'm looking after our mother. Our mother's dead, Thomas. Sheila's not. You're bleeding again. What? Shite! That boy in the pub hurt you, didn't he? Not as much as your fucking singing. I have to go and find Sheila. And you better start praying nothing's happened to her. Where's John? He's away trying to kill a guy. Don't let that bother you, Thomas. Just so long as you're all right, that's all that matters, isn't it, eh? I love John and Sheila, and you. But I made a promise to our mother, and I intend to keep it. Good for you, Thomas. Good for useless cunting you. Should we wait till morning? Get him when he goes to sign on? Get him when he goes to sign on, eh? What do you think? I think I'll kill him in the morning. You better get you some target practice there, eh? (WHIMPERING) Fuck, man, it was your idea anyway. Hey you, get back with that money. Move it! You bastard! I'm gonna get those fucking bollocks!

You're supposed to be in charge of safety in the workplace. Well, some job you're doing. Because I'm not supposed to be here today. I'm supposed to be at a funeral. I only come in here because I knew that youse were behind, and youse needed all the hands you can get. But what do you get for it? I nearly get killed. Well, I'll tell you, I want compensation.

But we can'nae wait for the rest of the immediate family. The [inaudible] are coming to inspect the church at half-past. You go right ahead, Father. Thomas. Uncle Ian, thanks very much for coming. I really appreciate it. Thomas, where are they? Who? Your brothers and your sister. I don't know. I thought you were staying at your ma's last night. I stayed here. Just as well, or my ma would have been buried under five foot of rubble. Did you see what happened to the statue to the Virgin Mary? Took her right off. Thomas, I think you should phone the house. Maybe they've slept in. Well, that's really sad, innit? I mean, what kind of people would sleep in for their ma's funeral? [ship horn] In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen. Lord be with ye. [inaudible] Tell me, Carole, when we get to that chapel, will you take that stupid hat off? It's not stupid. You're stupid. What did you say? What did you say there? Nothing. The Church is a house of God, and you'll show some respect. And there's no way you're taking that scabby dog in here, either. I think God's gone in [inaudible] first. [inaudible] up here. Up here. Let us pray. Almighty God, our Father, we firmly believe that your Son died and rose to life. We pray for our sister Rosemary, who has died in Christ. Raise her at the last day, to share the glory of the risen Christ. God, her Father, you have called your daughter from this life. Father of all mercy, fulfill her faith unto you, and lead her safely home to heaven, to be happy with you forever. Oh, Michael. Who are you going to walk away from? Are you all right? [inaudible] gone. Did you kill that guy? Did you kill that guy? No. Come here. I nearly killed him. Nearly killed him and his baby. I nearly killed a baby, Michael. What the fuck's wrong with me? You didnae kill him. You didnae kill his baby. [inaudible] And now let's go and say goodbye to our Ma with all the grace and all the dignity that she deserves. Right? [inaudible] A reading from the first letter of St. Paul, to the Corinthians. Death is swallowed up with victory. I will tell you something that has been secret, that we are not all going to die. But we shall all be changed. This will be instantaneous. In the twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet sounds, it will sound, and the dead will be raised, unperishable. And we shall be changed as well. Because our present perishable nature must put on unperishability. And thus not to nature must [inaudible] immortality. Do you know what's really scaring me, John? I think I may have fucked [inaudible] THOMAS: And when this, not of nature, has put on immortality. Thomas, [inaudible] Thomas. [interposing voices] Thomas! Are you coming, Thomas? SHEILA: Thomas! JOHN: Thomas! Sorry. Thought this thing of death is sin, and sin gets its power from the law. So let us thank God for giving us the victory through our Lord, Jesus Christ. This is the word of the Lord." [congregation murmurs] Would the pallbearers please come forward? I'll take her. You'll need some help, sir. I said I'll take her. Alone. I'm sorry, sir. I think you'll find she's too heavy. She ain't heavy. She's my mother. (WHIMPERING) Are you all right, Thomas? Thomas, are you all right? God bless. Thanks, darling. Cheer up. All right, Thomas? When did you get out of hospital? Just about a minute ago. When did you tell me? - I told you. - When? Last night. No, you never. I evered. I told you Michael was getting out of hospital, that we were going to pick him up, and if you wanted to come with us. Never did tell me. I'd have remembered if somebody told me. It's all right, Thomas. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried about it. Nobody told me, though, or I'd have remembered. I was going to come up and visit you, but I've been kind of busy. I can see that. You're looking well, though. I look shite. No, you're looking fit. Have you lost weight? Four and a half pounds worth. Yeah, 'cause you're a little lean about the face, good strong jaw. Thanks. Big brother. Looking good, brother. Hey, I'm going to have to go, before I start grieving. We're going to go for a curry. You want to come? Ach, I don't know. Don't know. Well, you're invited. Thanks for that. I maybe see youse down there later. Where are youse going? Shenan's. Well, I'll maybe see youse down there. You're not going to come, are you? We just want you to know that we're here for you. I want to know that. I do know that. And I'm here for youse. No, you're not here for us. This place is full of dead people, Thomas. We don't belong here. Now, are you coming? JOHN: Come on. Come on, Thomas. I'm not really hungry. All right, let's go. When I said I was here for you, I meant it. I am here for you. In my heart, I am. I'll maybe just come for a starter, then, 'cause the mushroom pakora's not bad. [music playing] THOMAS: See you ma. See you da. God bless.
