So, this stone, this glowing gem found hundreds of years ago in a Hibernian cavern, possesses a key to another world. known as a counter-earth, called Gor. How the stone works, the circumstances that govern its power and the nature of Gor itself are yet undetermined by modern science. Some suggest that Leonardo Da Vinci approached the answers to these questions in his famous discoursi. It is even thought that the transference of dimension was the last of Einstein's projects, but in the stone's power we can account for many out-of-body experiences. Many of the tales of the mystics and secrets of the psychic mind... Yeah. Laugh if you will, but the counter-earth lies close, close to each one of us... Okay, if you have any papers to hand in, please hand them to Miss Anderson, okay? Oh, have a good vacation. Oh, thank you. Have a good vacation. Beverly, meet you at the car in a few minutes, okay? Uh, yeah. Okay. Uh... goodbye. Bye. Beverly! Hey, Beverly! Oh, hi, Tarl. You were right on time. Now, I've calculated our traveling time, and if... If we only stop for about 28 minutes, - we'll be there in about two hours and 17... - Yeah. Minutes. Right. Tarl, I, I have to talk to you. Tarl, I, uh... Come on, what's the problem? Tarl, I... I've got to talk to you. Where are your bags? Tarl, I'm not going with you. What do you mean you're not going with me? I made all the arrangements! Wait till you see the cabin. Oh, Tarl! Norman showed me the place on the map. It's in the middle of nowhere. There's no electricity, there's no running water... Tarl, this has all been a big mistake. I never meant for it to go this far, but there's nothing for me out there. There's no nightlife, no clubs, no shops, nothing. But... I'll be there. That's not enough. Well, especially if I have to share you with your work. We've talked so much about this work. It's extremely important for me. I mean, we're almost finished. Tarl, this is a holiday. Oh, well, I mean that... I know your proposal for a grant is to study a family heirloom, and I know your father's ring is important to you, but there's more to life - than that. - Hey, hey, Tarl! How you doing? Hey! Hows life's greatest reason for birth control, huh? - Hi, Bev. - Hi, Norman. Hey, it's just a little joke, okay, guy? - Yeah. Let's go, Bev. Come on. - Yeah, uh, okay. Uh, sorry, Tarl. Hey, be careful with all that gear, okay? You'll get hurt. We won't have anybody to remind us what fashion used to be. I know what I'm doing, Norman. Yeah, sure you do, Tarl. Sure you do. Hey, guy, you are a statement. Chao. Stop it! Make for the cliffs! Take the stone, my son. Take it. Your home stone is now my father's. Your father is worse than a barbarian. The home stone is the spirit of our people! Mine. Help me. Stop. Mine. Man 2: Run! We can still make it! Run! Run! Run away! Run! Run! Look at the fine folks of the Koroba. How brave they are with the panic of defeat. I want them all killed or captured. Advise my son that not one person will escape. Go. - Go! - Yes, your Excellency. - Father! - Grab her! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Run, Talena! Run! - Run! - Hyah! You okay? Take your men that way, behind those rocks. You go this way, and we'll catch him out in the open. There he is! Get him! Hyah! After him! Hyah! Hyah! Hold it! Hyah! No! Stop, please. Please, stop. There is a very big mistake here. Uh, I am a physics professor at Harvard college, right? Okay? Stop right there. Uh, I'll show you my driver's license right away, okay? Here it is. Uh-huh. Here. See? It's a mistake. Ah! Hyah. Uh... I... Get the swords! Get their weapons! Here's one. Thank the Gods, this one is still alive. Your Excellency... He died a hero. You have won a great victory. You have the homes. Who killed my son? The man who killed him escaped, Excellency. Then he must be found. And until he is... 100 people, men, women, and children will be tortured. You will do that. Excellency. It's okay, it's okay. Where the hell am I? What a bad dream. Indeed, you are not dreaming, young visitor. You've come to a land called, Gor. Appropriate name. Come on, where are my clothes? Please, where can I find a telephone? Come on. We've had visitors like you before. We believe you have been sent to us through the stone. This? This is... Just a ring that my father gave me. You want it? Okay. I'll give it to you. I can give it to you and go, okay? No! That will not be possible. You've killed the son of Sarm. You're not safe on your own. He's dead? But it was a mistake! I, I can explain that. You were not sent here to help us? Help who? I can't help anyone! I had a car accident. I need help! Sarm has destroyed Koroba. He's taken our home stone like some small trinket of war! Half of our people have been slaughtered, and the others have been forced into slavery, even Marlenus! Slow down. Slow down. Who's Marlenus? Marlenus is my father. He's the ruler of Koroba. Uh! No, thank you. Wha... What's his name? What's the other one? Uh... smarm? Smarmy? Sarm, formerly of the priesthood. He came to power some passages ago by killing his king. As a priest, he believed in the same values we all do. But once king, he became obsessed by power. He's been attacking and destroying village after village, capturing their home stones and forcing the people into chains of slavery, killing everyone who resists. Are you friends of Norman? Did he put you up to this? He's not like any of the others. It will never work. We must go by ourselves. Talena, I think of Marlenus. And so do I, but what of the other survivors? They also saw what he did. They know of his ring. They believed, as we did, that he was sent here as a savior. We cannot tell our people. Talena is right. We could teach him to be what they expected. We must train him. If I could just lie down and have a couple of aspirins, please. - Huh? - It will never work! Other visitors from other lands place great importance upon our home stone. Without it, you'll never return to your native land. What do you mean? We have to retrieve the home stone from Sarm. He's taken it to his realm in the Sardar Mountains. The mountains are forbidden territory. The plains below are scattered with the parts of travelers and outlaws who sought refuge there. He must start his lessons at once. Come. Bring him. Come. Oh, no. - Cover your body with your shield. - Okay. Lift your sword. You've got three axis, - you can move on any axis. - Whoa! Whoa! Come on! Not bad. - Ah! - Come on! You would be dead, Cabot! If I was a barbarian, you would be dead! - I can do it. - Oh. That's it! Come on! Now go for the head! - Go! Go, go, go! - That's better. Hit! Hit, hit, hit! Excellent, Cabot! Come on, Torm. I knew he had it in him. You learn very quickly. It's no accident you came to us, Cabot. For everything that happens in our world, or yours, there is a reason. I've made a decision. He's ready for Sarm. Come on. Our journey to rescue Marlenus and the stone will not be easy. Gor is a harsh world, and she breeds hard people. Here in the wasteland, every man's hand would be against us. Even the sand will trick us if it can. Keep up, Cabot. Come on. Hey, isn't there an easier way to get to the realm of, uh... Where are we going? Sarm. Now, everyone stay alert! We must avoid contact with the outlaws and the nomads. They'd kill you for the clothes on your back. Is it not cold on your world as it is on ours? Well, I suppose so. I'm just not used to overnights in the desert. If you were in your land now, what would you be doing? What would I be doing? I'd... I'd be in a... In a cabin all by itself on a lake with warm clothes on, sitting close to a hot fire with... With Beverly. You have a woman? It's... No. It's just a dream. Gaya! Where is the rest of your family? I want to know. I don't... Know? You will tell me, won't you? You know you will. Your loyalties have always been a wasted emotion. Did you know that? Keep searching. My son's death will be avenged... Won't it? Again. Talena! Cabot! Wake up! - You okay? - Yes. Elder? I am all right. Torm, who was on guard? Who do you think? We lost almost everything we had. Torm... Stotelis isn't very far. We can bargain for supplies there. You can't get anything from Stotelis. Weren't you supposed to be on guard? We should be going. They may be back with reinforcements any time. Let's leave. Can I put this in your bag? This way. Come on. Quick! Over there! Those poor retches are destined for the mines of Sarm. Those children will go to the rich, as house slaves. Cabot. Cabot! We'll have to deal with the barbarians for supplies. Talena must look like a slave. Cabot, we need your tunic. My tunic? What for? - Hey! Hey! - What for? You're the one who got us into this mess. Did you have to do that to my shirt, uh? Got any iron shackles? In Sarm's realm, women are not permitted free. Let's go. We must keep off the slave route. Over here. Over here. Talena, I'm really sorry. It'll be all right. Come on, Cabot, we're here for supplies. Pay no attention to them. Just remember to hold me and treat me like a slave. We'll need some more weapons. I think we need at least two more swords... Of course. And maybe a crossbow or a bow for Talena. Yes. She always was very good with a bow. Let's keep going. We have to get some dry wheat, and some corn to chew. I know a merchant who won't cheat us. Do you need me to give you some help? No. I'll be all right. Just look after Talena, that's all. - Come on, Cabot. Cabot! - Buy a snake. Buy my snake! Beautiful animal. Beautiful animal. Buy my snake. We've already eaten, thank you. Out of my way! Hey, what is this place? It's a tavern. Surbus, my friend! I was just picking up a few things before moving out of town. Nice shirt. My little fool, I told you, "Not again." Mercy, Master. Do it! I told you to stay out of town, didn't I? I'm going out of town. When I get back, I'm going to slit your throat! You understand me? Yes, Master. - You understand? - Yes, I promise, Master. I'll leave immediately. Yes, Master. Thank you, Master. What? Hey! I don't think so. I could use a drink myself. You've seen enough. Let's go. There you go. Three pagas. Warm, please. We're in a hurry. What kind of bonds are these? Well, times are hard, sir, and metal's scarce. It's no way to keep a slave. And where are you headed? - To the Sardar Mountains. - What? Sardar mountains. The realm of Sarm. Others run from Sarm. You towards him? Of course, you'll never make it. Fire. Fire has destroyed all the lands, and there are outlaws everywhere. Hear that? Outlaws everywhere! We'll be all right. You'll need weapons and supplies. And, of course, you'll need this map to get there. Good. Now there's something I want. Dorna? Let us see, pretty slave girl, how you fare in the ring. Don't you... I want to see blood! If his slave wins, he shall have this map. If mine, I shall have her... And your head. Get her. Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Dorna! She's angry now! Look out! Kill her! Kill her! Hey! Hey, you! We made a deal! I want that map! You want the map? You crook! Give me that map! Hold your tongue, you fool! Come on! - I want that map! - Come on! Are you okay, Talena? Yes, I'm all right. You must learn to curb your anger. - These are barbarians! - I've noticed. - You've got everything? - Yes. Cabot. Talena, this is yours, your quiver and your sword. Cabot, you take this. I'll take the big bag. - What have you got in here? - Just food. Masters! Hup, at your service. It appears you need some protection on your long journey to the Sardar Mountains. - Bodyguard? - A guide? - I can save you time. - How? I know all the shortcuts. - What'll we do? - We take him! Carry your own weight. Come on. Surbus is a man who doesn't like to lose a wager, and he never forgets. Come on, hurry up. Wait. We could go up here. You've got something I want! And it's mine! Well, I warned you. Don't hurt her. She's mine! Come to me. Ha! Without their leader, they have no belly for a fight! If Hup is right, the Sardar Mountains lie more in that direction, and they are formidable. If he can also shorten our path there, he could be of great help. Hey, doesn't it sound hollow? Right here. Come on. We've only got a few more miles to go. Then we can make camp for the night. A few more miles? You'd better be kidding. I should never have let you talk me into this. The nerve of him. Ah! Help me! I'm sinking! Help me! - Help me! - Torm! Torm! Help! Help me! Pull! Pull! Pull! Come on! I've got him! Let's pull him out! Come on! Together! Pull! Pull! Give me a pull! Come on! Come on! Oh! Get him! Come on! Pull! Come on, pull! The bags! Get the bags! My sword! Careful, now. Wait. Come on, I've got to get my sword, Cabot! Cabot, there it is. Got it! The man you seek. Has been seen. Where? In the village of Stotelis. Apparently he's headed toward these mountains. Bring him here. I wouldn't want him to miss any of our hospitality. - Yes, Master. - Go. Keep your eyes open. Come on. Come on. Talena, lead the way. Halt! Stop the train! Hey! Hey, it's okay! I'm taking a pee. You just move on. - I'll join you later. - All right. Go! March! Forward! Let's go. There. Cabot, go that way. Torm, this way. Come. Come on. Let's go. Heave! Heave! Get 'em up! Pick her up! Pick her up! Heave! Heave! Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on. Go. All clear. Come on! Let's go, Talena. It's all clear. Wait. Wait. Go now. Quickly! No more, please! Water! - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. There it is... Sarm's back door! Only he doesn't know he has one. There should be a tunnel that takes us into the mine. Then we're very close to the main square. Be careful, all of you. Stay close to the wall. I gotta be careful. I can't see anything. Ooh! Cabot, your ring! You lead the way. Well, there's the tunnel. Come on. She's a victim of Darkosis. Disease that kills many in the realm of Sarm. Hopefully her agony will be short-lived. To the end of the tunnel! Quick! Stay close. We'll go to the end. Light that torch! Let's go! Move along. Quickly! Come on. The realm of Sarm. Well, Hup? I said I could get you there. I never said I could get you in. Feast your eyes! Feel the texture of her skin! Full lithe... Give me an offer. - Very well. I'll give you 20 pieces. - 20 pieces? I have to feed a family, sir! Thank you, sir! 30! - You there! - Thank you! 40! Straight from Port Kar. Take it. Arrest him! Move! Move! These slaves are from Port Kar. Please, please! They're always having these scuffles about the place! Please, please! Pay no attention! Pretty! Pretty! 12! 12! 12! High priests! Kings of Sarm! Why did you come so far to find me? I've come for the home stone of Koroba. Koroba? You are not from Koroba. Why is that home stone of such great consequence to you? I come from another world called Earth... And the stone is my ticket back. Most interesting. Most interesting. Why don't you stay here, accept my hospitality? And then if you are very lucky, I might allow you to use that home stone for your return to your... To your world "Ergth." Earth. Ah, yes. Earth! I'm not leaving my friends. Where are they? Where are they? Friends? They have no power to help you boy. Why should you be concerned about them? They happen to be human beings! Me. Here, I. I am the one that controls your life, boy... Your destiny. So, you've seen the new one. Come here. Let me show you something. Tafa, my sweets... Here. Yes, Master. Prepare to please our guest. Yes, Master. Are your thoughts still now with your friends in that village... Karib... Uh... Koroba. Oh. Koroba, yes. I am sure that she will please you. See, she has satisfied many, many people. Easy for you. Easy, my dear. Come, let us feast. Feast, my friends. Yes! Come! Bring on the food and wine! Come! Hey! Tafa, where are the home stones kept? I am only a pleasure slave. Where are they kept? Where's the secret vault? You've got to help me. Don't you want to be free? No, Master. I only wish to satisfy you. Enough! No more music. No more dancing. Honored, noble guests of the realm, and our friend, honored guest, from Afar. Now is the time for the ceremony of possession. - What a pity! - Bring them in! Oh! My king! Oh, my king! Gather around, yes. Make them kneel! - Ah! - The ceremony! Oh, the ceremony! Oh, boy, oh, boy! Bring this one to the forge. No! Oh! You'll want to watch this, Cabot. You see, it is a sport... A sport that gives much pleasure. It will give you a chance of experiencing the delight of giving pain. Come with me. All right. How quickly he adapts to the ways of our world? Does he not? The honor will be yours. Brand man. Talena. She is yours is she not? Brand her. Seize him! Seize him! Seize the lying cheat! The lying cheat! Seize him! Run, Talena run! Kill him! Kill him! Rogue! Get the two guards over there. I'll sneak in while you distract them. You okay? Yes. What is it? Who's out there? Who's there? Oh, guard! Open up! Who is that? Don't you remember me? Come forward. Open up. Stay where you are! I'll get the keys! Go! Talena! Here! Torm. Hurry. Quickly, now. - The keys. - Talena! Talena! - Did you find them? - Yes, but now we must find Marlenus. I think he's in the dungeon chamber below us. - How do I get there? - Go back and follow the passage to the left. Cabot... Be careful. Hurry! Hurry! Run! Marlenus! - Marlenus! - There's nothing to be gained by torturing me again. I've come to free you. Help me. Yes. Can you walk? I think so. Where is the home stone? Home stone? Yes, this way. Sarm tortured me by showing me where he keeps it. The entrance is blocked. Help! Help me! It's working. Ah! Marlenus, wait. This looks too easy. What is all this? The home stones. Of all the villages destroyed by that butcher. But which one? The stone we seek will only glow when touched by a native of Koroba. Please help me find the stone. Come on! Come on, sir! Move! Go! I found it... The spirit of Koroba. Now it's safe. Let's go. - Hurry! - Oh! Come on, this way! Come on! Come on, move it! Move it! Psst! Hey! - Talena! - Cabot! Cabot! Marlenus! - Father! - Talena, my child! Did they hurt you? I am well, Talena, I am well, and I have the stone. Marlenus. How do we escape from here? There! That way! Go now. Stay together. This way! It's no use. We can't get through here. - Come on. - Need a little help? It's Hup. Say "please." Give me the keys. Give! This way. Come on, come on. Through here. Praise God! Praise God! Soldiers! Get back! - Let's go... - That way! Cabot! Stop it! Bring them to me. I'm not surprised this often. Go do it. - Go do it! - Yes, Master. So, old man... Your vacation has been brief. I have seen enough of freedom to be grateful. Your strength is useless, old friend. You can no longer make slaves of free people. They have gained the will to fight. You can never win. Well, since you are all so attached to those values, and to your petty home stone I have decided that you will all suffer the same fate. Is everything prepared? Master. Then begin with her. Oh! Hey! Cabot! Watch this! Push him! No! Don't! People of Koroba, our city will be rebuilt. From all corners of Gor people will come carrying a stone that will add to the walls of our home. Freedom has returned! Dear. Thank you. Now that you have helped us break the bonds of slavery we owe a service to you. Well, maybe we'll discuss that. A cabin in the mountains near a lake? With a hot fire? And warm clothes? Let's go that way. Who are you? I am Xenos, a priest. I have come to guard the home stone. Well, you're a bit late. You're a stranger. I've not seen you here before. I was born here but left many years ago. Now I have returned. And where did you spend those years with priest-king Sarm? There are other priest-kings and many priests. I am but one of them. A humble servant of the Gods. I don't like that man. He means trouble. Don't worry. Maybe it's the other world that's a dream. Oh, hi, Tarl. Tarl. - Did you have a nice vacation? - Certainly. Oh, nothing much just... A priest-king, his warrior son, a few thousand slaves and a battle for a home stone. Sounds wild. Come on, Beverly. You're wasting your time with this jackass. - Let's get out of here. Come on! - Norman, I... Wait! Norman. Norman. Yes, Cabot? Norman! Tarl! Tarl! Excuse me. Tarl! Wait, Tarl! But back in Gor. The slave girl Lara was sold by her owner to Marlenus the king. There I encountered her for the second time and realized that in her supple body lay the means by which one day I, Xenos, a humble priest, could have in my own hands the home stone and become in all senses the ruler of Koroba. Far away on Earth was the one man who might prevent me... Tarl Cabot.
