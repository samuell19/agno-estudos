Once upon a time, there was no Moon in the night sky. There was no such thing as night. Just days with the hot Sun. All the rivers and streams were dry. All the crops died. Everyone on Earth was starving to death. All hope seemed lost At that moment, one mother decided to find the Sun God and asked him to turn off the sun so that she could save her children. In return, she would offer her own life and become the cool Moon. Although Hang had told many bedtime stories to Hung, her Little Star, the Moon Cake Story was still her favorite. She wanted Hung to get used to living with his father because she knew the day would come When she would have to leave her Little Star. Honey. Poor Hung. His mother was his whole world.

Don't ever think like that. I am the one who doesn't want to move. This is our home. All the memories we have of Mom are here. I will never move. It's not your fault. Don't ever think like that. METEOR SHOWER There's a meteor shower this Saturday. I will fix Comet tomorrow. Then, we'll go to Hoa Trung Lake this weekend. We can fly the plane, go fishing, then we'll camp and look at the stars. Would you like that? - Put the plane on the table. - Okay! Hung! That's Mom's table. Hey! Why are you out here? They're making a mess! Who cares? Go back inside! - But it's a mess! - Go back now! I'm going to tell on you. I'll throw this at you! Hurry! Hurry or I'll toss this! - What? - Go inside! Hey, pretty!

Maika Now head southwest. Our destination is Bratislava. "Whenever you need me, just look up to the sky". Meteors, Mom! Help me, Mom. Please help me. Run, honey! Come here, Hieu. The mountain is glowing! What? It's pitch black. Really. I just saw it! Girl, you're crazy! Oh god, my brand-new drone! You broke another one! That's what you get for scaring me. Why are you here anyway? Are you following me? Who has the time to follow you? I'm here to watch the meteor shower. To watch the meteor shower? Liar! Watch the meteor shower with a drone? You're supposed to use a telescope! My god I'm so glad I found you. As a tutor, I don't have time to drive for you to meet a friend. Who's his friend? Do you want a lift home? Of course, you do. Only a crazy person would ride their bike up here. Hey, I noticed that your bike is rigged with an electric motor! That's cool! Can you make me one, too? Why are you still standing there? Let's go! Hurry! Hurry up! Come on. Let's go! - Do you even know which way to go? - I sure don't. Remember to make me a bike like yours! But make it in red. I'm crazy about red. Where did you go without telling me? Do you know how worried I was? You promised to watch the meteor shower, but you broke your promise! You always do that! Hung! - Do you trust me now? - That's a nice trick. Those who stayed up late last night had the stars aligned in their favor. The blackout throughout the city made all the stars more visible! Thus, Tech billionaire Nguyen Dai Nghia intends to build a launch pad in Da Nang! That's it? What about purple lights in the mountain? Why are you so loud, son? one man made our entire nation proud. He was not only the first Vietnamese but the first Asian to travel in space! By now you already know to whom I'm referring. That is Mr. Pham Tuan. Today, I will be the first Vietnamese to join the space race! In the year 2024, we will not only set foot into space, but we will set a milestone in the history of space travel! Allow me to introduce Cygnus! Ho Hoa Trung will be our nation's first space shuttle launch base, a place where passengers can board our spaceships and take off into space! Travel from the nearest space station to the furthest reaches of space. Make space our home. Amazing. It's too bad about the lake though. We won't be able to fish there anymore. I have waited for this moment my entire life. Boss Did you pay 20 million dollars for this mountain? There's nothing around here but rocks called tektite. In this whole area, any rock that you pick up is a tektite. Do you want to see something weird just up this hill? I'm sorry. Are you hurt, sweetie? No, not at all. Where are you going? To a picnic with my Dad. You're having a picnic with this? Yes. My Dad makes it good! He also makes rice noodles, crab noodles, and beef ph! Thank you, miss. See you, miss. Bye-bye! So frail. Exhausted? Look. There. See how all the trees look like they've been chopped across? Something cut the trees, and carved a path down into the lake! There. Take a close look! It wasn't here yesterday! It has just appeared! I told you. It's strange! Right? Are you still using that old flip phone? How embarrassing, right? No I mean that flip phones have advantages, too. Like when I get mad, I can throw it at the wall! The battery comes flying out, but I put it back, and-- It still works. If people don't break their phones, then I'd be out of work. How's it going with the phones I brought you? Done. Where are you? Aren't you hungry? Come out already! Here. - How was your picnic with Hung today? - When? This morning he seemed like he was in a rush. Maybe I misheard. Did Hung say where he was going? Have you tried calling him? Yesterday I yelled at him for taking off without permission. These days I can't tell what's on his mind. I've noticed that the kids in the Children's Ward, rarely let adults know what they want. This is for the phones. Thank you. WHERE ARE YOU? Dad's texting? Can I skip lunch? What's that? I MADE NOODLES FOR YOU Again? Comet! Hey! You're naked! How can you go outside without clothes? Here, wear this. Do you know how to get dressed? Now I can see your face. Why weren't you wearing any clothes? Joyeh to hale zazemi? What? Muvlish Chezki? I don't understand what you are saying. Can you speak Vietnamese? Viet nam mese. Viet nam ski. That's right, you're in Vietnam. What is your name? Ah, you're from Hanoi! I thought you were an alien! My name is Hung, what is yours? Maika. Maika? Like the alien girl from the TV show? No, from the planet Maika. Are you here to spy on us or to kill us? No, I'm here to find my comrade. Comrade? Your friend? What's the friend's name? We don't have names on Maika. No names? Then how do you call each other? We don't talk on Maika. If you don't talk, then how do you communicate? Your spaceship is damaged. How will you get home? No, I need to reach my friend first then I can call the mothership. Call? I know! Tell me the number and I'll call. I need to fix my transmitter to call my friend. Oh, is that all? My Dad can fix any phone! Samsung, Nokia, even Oppo! I'll ask my Dad to help since we are friends. We are friends? That's right. We're friends. But I don't know what to call you. How about Maika? High five! On Planet Maika, you don't know high-five? Here's how you high-five. High-five! Whenever we do something cool, we high-five. High-five! Now that you know, can you do this trick? You can't do that one. How about this trick? Can you do that? You can do it! Okay, that one is good, but for this one you'll need to focus. I dare you to do that. Yes! I will do it. It stinks! High-five! Makato! Duty! Honesty. A samurai warrior, once he accepts a task, then he must complete that task! Then why are all those people still living in my building? Hi-So gave me six months. Now I only have one week. If not, then they will buy the adjacent lot. Find out what is important to them, and break them into pieces for me! Go! Dad? Dad? What were you looking at? Do you like tektite stones? Tektite is not a stone. It has healing powers. Really? My Mom also said that tektite has the power to heal. But my Dad doesn't believe it. Do you like it? I'll give you one since you like it. Let's go inside. Don't touch that! Don't touch anything on this table, or my Dad will get angry. Why does he have to get angry? I don't know, but for sure he's mad, because I was supposed to be home by now. Don't touch anything else. Oh no, I touched it! I'll go eat dinner and be right back, okay? No, I need a transmitter to call my comrade. Hold on! It's not safe out there. What if you accidentally change into an alien and someone tells the cops? Cops? I told you, my Dad can fix anything. He can even fix your spaceship and find your comrade. He can't fix the spaceship. Then he can fix the transmitter. Just stay here. Don't go anywhere until I come back, okay? Don't move! Don't follow me! Stay still! Beef noodles! Dad! Do you know what happened to me today? Oh. Why is Ms. Trang in our house? What's wrong, son? Can I skip dinner tonight? If you don't eat, then you'll have to tell me where you went today. And why you lied to me and Ms. Trang. Where were you? What does he have to lock up so securely? Bull, the kid is inside! Maybe he's so scared he peed his pants. I'll go in to change his diaper. Teach him a lesson, Bull. I made a new friend today. You did? Where does he live? My new friend is a girl. Did you get a girlfriend? - What's her name? - How old is she? - Where does she live? - Is she pretty? - Can we meet her? - Can we meet her? No! My friend is not a normal girl. How is that? Hung Come out, so that we can talk like a man to a man. I just want to be sure That you're not going to tell anyone about what you saw. Flashlight? You're going to fight me with flashlights? Remember This is your idea. Get him, Bull! Who are you?! Maika. Your friend's name is Maika. Just like in the TV show that you and I like watching? So Maika's spaceship fell on Earth, got wrecked, and now she's looking for her friend. Lucky she found you, right? I'm telling the truth! Stop joking around! Maika's spaceship that fell with the meteor shower is wrecked! I already promised her that you would fix her spaceship, so you have to do that! Meteor shower. A broken spaceship. You made up this story because I broke my promise to you, right? How can a hulk like you let a little punk kick your ass? No, that's no kid! It's a demon. A demon! Wake up! What demon? Get back in there! No. It will kill us! Let's go. - Let's go! - Are you scared? Let me go break his neck! Let go! Let me deal with him! - Let's go home! - Why you-- - It'll kill us! - You want to fight me? - Go home! - You dare beat up my brother? - It will kill us both! - Are you lying? Why won't anyone trust me? There is. Your Dad trusts you. Of course, Maika is real. But you know what? Sometimes when we don't feel well, we can get depressed. So our emotions can get chaotic. Do you think that your friend would ever want to harm you? Harm me? I mean, does Maika want to hurt you? Maika saved me. I almost drowned. Did you go swimming alone? Why are you here? Why are you always around my Dad? Hung! Don't be rude. Apologize to Ms. Trang. - Why should I? - Because you were rude! - She's the reason! - Don't talk back! Go outside and fold your arms! Don't come back home unless you're willing to apologize! If Mom were here, she'd go after me already. - Pick on someone your own size! - Shut up! Why do you have to be such a punk? - Why can't you play somewhere else? - Why do you care where I play? - Because that clubhouse belongs to Hung! - Who is Hung? Just because you're sick doesn't mean you can say whatever you want! Bin! - Don't talk to your brother like that! - But he messed with my friends! Friends? Why do you think they play with you? It's because you buy toys for them! At least I have friends. Leave. You'd better not come around to my clubhouse again! What? Scare me? Do you think you can scare me? You! You two are scary! - Are you hurt? - No. But he's always picking on me! I know. I am a tutor, not a bodyguard, always having to protect you! But he took over my friend's place! Your Dad will deal with him tonight. Dad said he won't be back in another week! Right. Next week? Yes. Keep your cool. Don't get mad. I want some, too. Don't get mad. It's ruined. Maika Maika! Maika. Maika, are you hurt? What happened here? Were you scared, Maika? No. They've ruined Mom's working table. Mom loved this table. "Loved this table"? That's right. Just like Aunt Thu loves her garden, and Uncle Van loves his oven. Uncle Van loves an oven? I wish there was a way for me to explain. Hey, that's Mom! You have to raise this. That's right. Then you lower this. If your heart flutters You know you're in love Mom also loves this song. A lingering autumn afternoon Light kisses Blowing through the bamboos Autumn leaves falling down Wake up, son! Happy birthday, son! Happy birthday! Wow! - Wow! - Open it, son. Wow! - Do you like it? - Yes! Take a long bit, and wrap it around twice. Just like that. What's wrong, Mom? It's nothing. It's too painful. I don't want to continue the treatment. Mom Mom Hung Come sit by me. Why does your hair always smell so good? My Mom asked why my hair always smells so good. Don't. That's a teardrop. It tastes salty. So does a booger, but I wouldn't eat it. Are you still sad? Want me to fix that? You're fixing it! Can you fix Dad's store, too? Maika! Maika! Maika! My Dad bought me these pajamas, but they don't fit. Are you done, Maika? It fits perfectly! Maika It's too dirty to lay here. Let me lay a mat down first. Maika. Maika Sorry, Maika For leaving you alone. Just rest here Until you have found your friend. I promise you that no one will hurt you again. Load that carefully. - Handle it gently! - Nghia, sir. I found this plane in the lake Next to that spaceship. Look into that logo. Yes, sir. Did you have a chance to speak with Hung last night? He was asleep when I got back. - What's wrong? - This shop feels different. You recently tidied up the shop? No. This fountain is new! It's always been there. You didn't notice because it was broken. So you just fixed it? No What are you looking at? Hung's alien friend? What are you looking at? Hung's alien friend? Get the car. Maika. Maika. Maika! Maika! The cake is lumpy! Wow You also cleaned up your shop! What do you mean by "also"? Because you also cleaned up my oven. When did I clean your oven? Can you show me? Hit it hard! Hard! Once more. Once more! There you go. Isn't that pretty? This one's yours. My daughter used to help me make cakes just like this. Hung! Come in! This little angel is helping me make cakes! But what is your name, angel? Maika. Mai Mai is part of my daughter's name. Maika, let's go home so that auntie can work. It's okay, Hung. Mai is helping me make cakes. But last night, I saw you wearing a raincoat. Now you're wearing pajamas. Don't you have any prettier clothes? - You saw Maika for real? - I sure did! Mai made a bright light that helped make the flowers bloom! Come! Come with me and let's find you a nice dress! So? Are you sure you're not the one who did this? - No. - Really? Come on. I know all about it. His store was supposed to be trashed. The garden was supposed to be destroyed. The oven was supposed to be smashed to bits! Just look! I told you idiots to destroy it, not to redecorate it! It's not that, Boss. It's that monster. It restored everything to normal! If you had looked into its red eyes! It's like looking right at the God of Death's eyes! Then you'll die! Kichigai! If he's crazy, then you get crazier! If he strikes a match, then you light a torch! Then you run into his house, and turn his house to ashes! Only then will he fear you! Understand? I'm giving you the next three days. Drag them out of the building by the necks! If Hi-So decides not to buy my building and buy the lot next to the harbor, I will let Tiger eat you alive. Tiger. Bite! Woah, Tiger! Easy there, Tiger! Easy, Tiger! Come on, Tiger. Stay away from me! Oh! Tiger! Beautiful. But you need this lantern made by Uncle Van to complete the outfit. - Is anyone here? - Yes. Please wait a moment. You're Mr. Nguyen Dai Nghia, the CEO of Cygnus. I saw your press conference on TV. What brings you to my shop? I'm talent scouting for my launch base. Don't you already have a team full of scientists? I'm looking for people who think outside the box. Like that fountain of yours. Did you make that yourself? I just made that for fun. This is no common hobby. What did you do before you opened this shop? A scientist? I graduated as an engineer. My thesis was on sound levitation. What luck! When I saw Uncle Van walk in, I almost peed my pants! Any more cakes? What? Did you finish the cakes already? Tektite, the healing stones. Did you know that tektite comes from space? Yes. Tektite can also be used to contact aliens. To be honest, my wife knows about these stones more than me. Do you think it's ridiculous? If it helps heal the one wearing it, then why should medication matter? True. But a scientist without faith will not get very far. It's okay. - You need to recover! - Mr. Van! Maybe your hair will be all purple again. My gosh, you fixed so many things last night that you even passed out! No cakes? These are debt bills, not cakes. Debt? That's right and if we don't pay, they will kick us out of our home. No more house? - Maika will fix it! - Not everything can be fixed. Right now you have to regain your strength. But I am strong. Look! What's wrong? Do you need some water? Do you live here? I live with my son, Hung. Hung. What's he like? Well He's brave and smart. He just doesn't talk much. That's enough, Maika. I know you're strong. Maika! Your son seems to be very interesting. I'd like to meet him someday. Really? He'd be thrilled to hear that. He idolizes Cosmonaut Pham Tuan. He's upstairs! Can you wait while I call him? Dad? - Hi son, there's-- - Hi Dad, sorry, I'm busy. Can't talk. Bye! Kids They spend all day playing with their phones. That's enough, Maika! Why don't you and your son come visit my company? Whenever you like, just call my assistant. She'll prepare the best dish for you. Don't lose faith. The power of ideas can still change the world! I told you I'm strong. Does your son own a blue and white toy plane? Yes. How did you know? I recognized the logo on it from your shop sign. My workers found it by the lake. We'll have it fixed and returned soon. Consider it my gift for you. If you can do all this Then why can't you fix your own spaceship? Materials from planet Maika can't be replicated. Can you turn your hair back to purple again? No, my skin and my hair are linked to my energy. - What does that mean? - It's like a battery. I have to get back to the mothership to recharge. That's why we need to build the transmitter. Let me help. We'll help each other! We'll pass out the flyers to the rice shop, the noodle shop And the cafe. Hurry, Maika! We'll lose customers if we're late. We need to pass out flyers to help Dad! Your screen looks cracked. Get the date right! Eat! What are you looking at? I'm very upset! Hello? Did he hang up? - Did your phone break, sir? - You're damn right. It's broken! It's fixable. - Excuse me? - What can I help you? A boat sailing dreamily down the river What do you think, Hung? It's gorgeous! Together with the wind Following the moonlight The waves are stuck with nostalgia Time going by, singing life to sleep Oh my boat, please sail to the horizon So that I can visit the land of poetry Under the moonlight While listening to an unknown song These tektite beads are the batteries that will power the transmitter. But these look too small. Might not be powerful enough. Let's give it a try! The small beads are too weak. We need bigger pieces like this one! Can we use this? Do you need bigger stones? Wait a minute. It works well now. Thank you. Good day, sir. Let Mr. Nghia know that I'm here if he needs anything. Don't worry. I'll let him know. Thank you, sir. Nguyen Dai Nghia? Hi, Tektite shop here. - Nghia's speaking. - Mr. Nghia. Thank you so much for fixing my son's drone. Let me know if you need me to do anything. Then what would you say if I asked you to work for my company? I don't understand why you need me when you've got many talented scientists. Because sound levitation is the core of my space flight technology. My instincts also tell me that my plans for Cygnus won't succeed without you. I know that this is a great opportunity for me. But it doesn't help me or my son. I'm making this offer while considering your son. I also offer all my best scientists a house with a beautiful ocean view. You will also be making enough money to send him to an international school. Isn't that better? It's true that a house with an ocean view and sending my son to an international school is my dream. Thank you for giving me a great opportunity. - You don't need to thank me-- - Give me a few days to consider. You don't need to think it over-- These are the biggest stones in the shop! Will they work? Now we just need a satellite dish and a super high place to transmit! I have a satellite dish, too. But it's at my space clubhouse. What's wrong with the space clubhouse? Tell your monkey friends to put me down! You heard him, monkeys. Let him go! Bin! Don't let me go! If I fall and die, I'll go home and tell dad! Hey! Bring him down! - He's sick. Stop messing around! - Hey, then what about my face? Put me down! Who the hell are you, punk? Take your girlfriend and scram! Girlfriend? I thought we were friends. I ain't dead but you already have one? A pretty one, too! Shut up, Beo. I'm trying to help you! Enough talk. Drop him! Hey! Put my friend down! What if I don't? Get lost! Save me! I'm going to die! Oh god, I'm going to die! I'm going to die! Oh god, the inhaler is broken! Oh god! Beo! Stop screaming. You're fine. Will you marry me? Beo, don't harass Maika. Maika! What a beautiful name! Beo! Help me with this satellite dish! What do you want to do with it? I have no time to chit-chat with you. Now that those punks know that Maika is an alien, Maika is no longer safe here. I need to grab the transmitter, then go with Maika up to Ba Na Hills! That's easy. We'll take my car. We? Who said you were invited? You can't take Maika to the most romantic spot, especially in Da Nang without me. Got it? Besides, you still need my car! Do you have a car? Yes! I have a driver who will do anything I ask him to do. Go home and get the transmitter. He and I will be waiting! Are you sure? Sure! Hey! Are you nuts? That's gasoline! I know it's gasoline. I was checking to see if it burned. What if they sold us the fake gas? Fake gas? I'm a tutor, not a driver. It's real! Maika, wait up! Your hat and jacket! The purple demon! - What? - There she is! She's with Hung! Where are they going? Hurry down and help me catch them! Oh, Mr. Dong Isn't Beo coming with us? His Dad is coming home tonight. I can't let him go play with you. Hurry up, Ngao! Hurry! - My pants are on fire! - Move your ass already! This is the highest spot on Ba Na Hills. We can pretend to be tourists, and hide here until the park closes. Oh no! Forgot about the money for the tickets. - What are we going to do? - Don't worry. Kids get a 50% discount. Fine. I'll lend you some money. I'm a driver, not a bank. Oh! I mean, I'm a tutor! You kids got me all confused! Hey, girl! I'll take two tickets. For both of you, it'll be 1.5 million VND. - Two tickets cost 1.5-- - I don't have that kind of cash! Can we get the discount for children? What's up? I'm trying to buy the tickets. I understand why it's hard for you to decide. On one hand, you want please Hung but on the other hand, more money means a better future for him. But what if he misunderstands and thinks I'm doing it for the money? Then don't think about the money. If you just consider Hung's happiness, then what will you think of? I don't know. Try to close your eyes. What do you see? Hung is running by the lake. The two of us are camping. lying on the grass, looking at the stars. Hung is in this park with the purple-haired girl. I want you to check the tower. In position. The Glass House. I'm in position. And the station? I'm in position. Report if you see anything strange. Are you hungry, Maika? No problem. We've got food. Would you like to hear the Moon Cake Story? A long time ago, there was no Moon, only the Sun. All the rivers and streams were dry. The land was dry and all crops were dead. Everyone was thirsty and hungry. WELCOME HOME, DAD Please accept your dad's apology. One mother decided to save her children by making a plea to the Sun God. Hung! Hung! She crossed streams and rivers, hills and mountains, and swam across the sea until she was so tired she fainted. Then a white rabbit walked by and asked, "Oh, what happened here?" She told him the whole story, then he took her to meet the Sun God. The Sun God said, "What are you doing here?" She replied, "Can you please turn off the Sun for a little while?" The Sun God replied, "It's impossible. If I turn off the Sun, then the demons will come out and harm the humans. I will need someone to keep the light on at night." She said, "I can do it." The Sun God replied, "You can't, because you won't see your family. Because you will do this every night." Then she said, "I can do it. I will do it." So the Sun God agreed and allowed her to see her family one last time. Why does your hair always smell so good? Finally, the mother turned into a beam of light, and shined a light down for all humankind, and down upon the house, where her children slept. Please don't leave me. I can't raise him alone. You can. Just be there for him. Since then, people make moon cakes to honor her every year. Would you like me to erase the sad memories? What for? To erase my memories? - Uhm. - Don't do that. But they make you sad. I'm sad because I miss her. If I forget my mother, then how can I remember her? Have some more, Maika. Secure the tower now! Use the electric pulse gun. Do not harm the girl! Copy that? Are you okay, Maika? I'm okay. Were you able to call? No. Was the stone too weak? Maika! You're getting weak. Please stop! Maika! Maika! Don't! I can sense my friend now. Maika! Snap out of it, Maika! Maika! Maika! Maika, the bad men are here! Maika, we need to go! Monster! Maika! Hung! Up! Stay down! You'll fall! They can fly! Let's go, Maika. Looks like we got away, Maika. But I found my friend. It's not what you think. Hang on, Maika! Hold on, Maika! Maika! It's the bad man! Maika! The bad man! Wake up, Maika! Maika, help! Maika Maika, we dropped the backpack! Maika Is that Hoa Trung Lake? Maika Maika! Maika! Cover your eyes, Maika! Thanh, his finger just moved. Hung. Dad's here, son. Where is this? You're at the hospital. Hospital? Are you feeling unwell? Why are there so many balloons? Your friend Bao sent them. Bao? Who is Bao? He's the chubby one. Chubby? Beo. - Maika! - Son! Where is Maika? Let me go! - Maika isn't real. - Let me go! - Aliens are not real, son. - She is real! She was taken by Nghia! When I found you at the lake, you were by yourself, Hung! - There was only you. - I don't trust you! You're lying! If Mom was here, she'd trust me! - Son - I hate you! - I'll get the doctor. - I trust you, Hung. - I'm telling you the truth, Hung. - I hate you! Doctor Let me go. Where's my Dad? He went home to shower and change since haven't slept for two nights. Don't. But I have to go save my friend. Sure, but how can you help when you're sick? Okay, I'll be honest. I know that you don't like me. But I always want the best for you and your father. Do you trust me? Then do you believe that Maika exists? Thanh. You said that your son was here, so I thought I should come visit. It's the bad man! So have you considered my offer? In another circumstance, I'd accept it immediately But in this case - I don't think that I can-- - That's enough. I'm not used to being rejected. It's all right. Something could happen in the future to change your circumstances. What an incredible girl. So small but sleeps for days! A samurai warrior, when he has failed his duty, will use this tanto to open his belly and protect his master's honor. If you die, who will collect my money? Hi Towers already bought the adjacent lot! Who will I sell my building to now? Konnichiwa! Konnichiwa! Konnichiwa! Hello, this is Bushido Agency. Cygnus? Nguyen Dai Nghia? Boss! Astro Nghia! Astro Nghia! Astro! Astro Nghia? What do you want? I think this is a good time for you to have a heart-to-heart talk with Hung. Sit down and listen to him. And start to believe in things that you don't normally believe. You mean I should believe in Hung's imaginary friend? You should trust your son. Thanh! Beo! - Beo, Maika needs our-- - Hung! Maika has been-- Will you let me go? What? I bought you all these gifts, and now I can't even get one hug! Let go! I don't have time to play with you. Maika is in danger and needs our help! Do you know where Maika is? Yes, but we're kids and they're bad guys! Where's your dad? Why not ask him to help? My dad doesn't trust me. Right now I just need weapons. Weapons? Why didn't you say that sooner? I have a wall full of weapons! Isn't that awesome? They're all foam guns! That's right! They're all foam guns. Oh You want those guns that shoot bullets. I can tweak the guns to shoot whatever we want. Anything but foam! Why so aggressive? - Hung! - What? You don't like it? There's more! You don't like it? Exhausted! How dare you take Maika! Kimchi? Are you hungry? No, this is one is for the bad guys! You're nuts, Beo! Have you ever been slapped in the face with kimchi? It's super stinky and spicy! If you want it stinky, then just open your mouth! Now we have to get to Nghia's company. But that place is high. My bike won't make it. Leave this problem to me! Do you like it? Sure! What's going on? Bin! Don't mess with me! Go away. I have to rescue my friend! With what? Foam, Smoke bombs, and a slingshot? What will I tell Dad if something happens to you? Doing stupid things is my specialty. Where to? I'll drive for you. What's this? A mosquito zapper? - Don't! - Bin! The doors are locked! What do we do? Hurry, Beo, let's go! CYGNUS - WARNING Hey. I thought you said that Maika was here. Hey, come here! Her skin is blue like a gecko, but somehow he wants her. Take her hand out. Take the car down to the garage. When I call you, bring the girl up. Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Beo? - Kimchi bomb! - Stop it! To the garage! - Where's the money? - I was going to ask you where the girl is. But I already know that. If you shoot us, the girl will sleep for good, too. Don't worry. These are EMPs, not machine guns. One shot is all it takes to fry your car engine. But you'll be fine. At worst, you have to walk home. I can use Grab. No Not kimchi! I bought the port for 50 billion VND. But after I sign it over to you, you can double that value. Not to mention Hi-Tower still wants to buy the building you are selling. Are you related to that girl? I noticed you're spending a lot on her. If I was related to her, you wouldn't still be here. Oh, hello! You little punk! You'd better not let me catch you! Now! Bin, hurry! Take the rope and tie him. I've looked into Cygnus. I know all about your space race. Do you want to know my take on it? In 2015, scientists discovered the energy that is created from the collision of two dying stars. They used powerful telescopes to observe and witness a magnificent light show in space. We're too late, Beo. You're so full of it. Step aside! The death of this star was the birth of something else. Maika is alive! Maika! So strong! So beautiful! The debris created in space from the dead stars creates enough gold to equal the mass of the Earth. All this space race has nothing to do with improving humanity. But a big rush to scoop up gold. I smell some greed here. Just bring the girl up, and you can say whatever you want. Hey. Bring the girl up here. Can you stop plucking your stubbles? Bring the girl up here! Are you deaf? Bring her up here now! Can you hear me? Hear this... What are you doing, Beo? Bio-weapons? I was just playing! Playing? We have to go! Secure the garage. I'm on my way. We're not done dealing! You don't have the girl. There's no deal. Get him! Why are you standing there? Go catch the girl first! - Okay! - Wait! - What's wrong with you? - You drive like a madman! Where's my money? Kichigai! Make a turn! Hurry! - Beo, they have guns! - Keep driving. I have guns too! You! Go to hell! Block the exit! What kind of driving is that? - The car has gone crazy! - How? - Why did the door open? - The engine is broken! - Hey! There's a wall! - Make a turn now! - It's a dead end! - Make a turn! Shoot him! Bin, hurry! He's catching up to us! Shoot his helmet! Shoot his tire! You two punks are trying to take me on? Beo! It's a dead end! Help me! Shoot his boobs! Shoot his balls! How can you shoot me? No way! You crazy driver! You drive like a maniac, Bin! Hey there's another car! I'm going to puke! Bin! Stop braking! We're out of ammo! Catch up to them! Papa's got this! Eat boogers! Slime it up! Keep shooting! Chalk bombs! Hurry! Kichigai! Beo! Beo, close the door! Fatty! Get me the backpack! Fatty! Are you giving me an appetizer? - What is that? - Kimchi! Ah! My eyes are burning! Want some kimchi, Hung? Hey, it's Nghia! Bin! Go back! Go back, Bin! Do it now! Bin! Bin! Beo! You killed my friends! - Just tased them, they're fine-- - Let go! - Don't touch Maika! - That's enough! Son. Are you and Maika okay? Do you trust me now? I'm sorry. I won't break my promises anymore. Maika Maika is very weak, Dad. Maika is fine, son. Let's get you home, Maika. Kichigai! Dad! Don't, Maika! Maika, don't! You're still too weak! Don't! Maika! Maika, don't die! Maika, please don't die. - Maika's dead, Dad. - Maika isn't dead. She can still be saved. What are you saying? I can save Maika. How? With this. It can also help her recover as easily as charging a battery. How can you be so sure? Because I have met Maika's comrade. I have examined him. Friend Comrade Where is he? Born from a star. In death, Tektite. That's why tektite has healing powers. Your wife knew this. But she found out about it too late, And she didn't have enough. But me? I have a whole mountain of tektite. Only I can save Maika. Can you save Maika? Yes. But only on the condition that you will never see her again. Why not? Because I need Maika to help with my work. She's going to help me reach the Moon and beyond. If I agree to work for you, then my son can visit. Sorry, but that offer no longer stands. Only Maika's life matters now. Do you promise you won't hurt her? I promise. I will heal her and never do anything to harm her. Deal? Maika Don't forget me. Here. Whenever you are sad or miss Maika too much, just look at the Moon. She'll always be there. Maika. Maika Listen to me There's no need to cry. Maika will live again because of you. She will live because of you. Right now Maika is not by your side, but you haven't lost your friend. Because when you love someone with all your heart, then she will always be with you. Wherever they go. Listen to me. Close your eyes. Now I want you to remember all the times that you and Maika were together. What were your happy times? Your sad times. Remember. Try to remember, son. Fill your heart with all those happy moments with Maika. What do you think, Hung? It's gorgeous! Now I want you to gather them all, and then send it to your friend. So that she can carry them with her. Forever in my heart, wherever you go. - Forever in my heart - Forever in my heart - Wherever you go. - Wherever you go. Forever in my heart wherever you go. Forever in my heart, wherever you go. Forever in my heart, wherever you go. Forever in my heart, wherever you go. Forever in my heart, wherever you go. Forever in my heart, wherever you go. Maika! Don't kill me. My friend and I will go home now. No. Don't! That's my life's work! No! What now? You have to dream another dream. Maika! Don't kill him! I didn't kill him. I just took away the thing that makes him sad. You're alive, Maika! The bracelet! Hey, don't use up all of my hugs! Too far! Can you help me a little, Maika? So far What? Please stop! Please put me down, I beg you! - Wow! It's so beautiful! - It's ginormous! It's even bigger than a normal spaceship! Thank you for helping me get home. Thank you. For helping us have a home to return to. Forever in my heart wherever you go. That's enough, Beo! Do you want to fly? Now we'll both use our super powers and make this fire burst into a fireball. Let's go to sleep. We're going fishing tomorrow morning. Can I stay here just a bit longer? Pace yourself, son. Not too long. Thanks, Mom. Goodnight, Mom.
