I'm from London too. - Really? - Hey Kathy, could you go through that combination again? Why don't we sit down over here? By the way, my name's Mike. What's yours? - Hi, I'm Julie. - So you're a dancer. Are you a good one? - A good one? I'm a great dancer. - Oh, yeah? Tell me what brings you here? - Well, I have a dream. I wanna dance on Broadway. - Several years ago, I came here with that same dream. I guess I still have it, but I haven't been lucky enough to find a dynamite dance partner. Hey, maybe now you'll be my dance goddess. - Dance goddess. I kind of like that. - I'm not putting you on. I mean it. - Really? - Julie, I work very hard at what I do, but I just haven't been lucky enough to get a break. - Well I don't think luck has anything to do with it. If you have enough fire in you to get what you want and you've got some connections, then that'll do it. - Oh, well here Doc has the connections. By the way, how do you know Doc? - Well, I don't really know him. I know a friend of Doc's who asked me to get in touch with him whenever I needed help. So do you know when I'll be back? - Oh, he should be back soon. But in the meanwhile, if you like, you can look around, browse, have a cup of tea, or if you like, you can join the class. - Really?

Ooh! - Oops. - Do you live here alone or do you have a roommate? - No, I live alone. - Must get lonely sometimes, huh? - Sometimes. But I've been living here for about 10 years now. So it's all right. - Do you have a girlfriend? - Sort of. - What do you mean, "sort of? - Well, my boss, Maggie's got a crush on me. She's really great choreographer, but I really don't love her. She's just not my type. (ball clacks) - Hmm, is that so? Well, can I ask what is your type? - You're my type. (bright music) (phone rings) Yeah? No, I wasn't home. I just got back. Yeah, I'll come right over. - Who was that? - A friend. Listen, Julie, I'm gonna take you home. Tomorrow's gonna be a big day. We're gonna be dancing in Times Square. - Times Square, isn't that where all the Broadway theaters are? - Yeah, it's the heart of New York City. It's just like our Piccadilly in London. - Can I dance with you guys? - Yeah, sure. Now you're one of the gang. (bright music) (upbeat music) (doorbell buzzes) - Come in. The door is open. - [Mike] Hey Maggie, how you doing? - You goddamn son of a bitch. Where the hell were you? I called you a million times. The phone kept ringing and ringing. - Hey, hey, just calm down. I'm sorry, I wasn't home. Brand new dynamite dancer at the studio. Her name is Julie. But Doc asked me to show her around the city, all right? - So you were out fooling around with Julie while I was here feeling miserable? You know, you don't care about me anymore. You don't love me. - Look, Maggie. I'm sorry, all right? You know I care about you. You know I love you. (upbeat music) I'd never do anything to hurt you. I'm all yours. - Do you like Julie? - Oh, come on. I don't even know her. One thing I do know, she's a dynamite dancer and you're gonna love watching her tomorrow. (dramatic music) (upbeat dance music) Hi, Maggie. This is Julie, our dynamite new dancer. - Hi, Maggie. How are you? - Hi, Julie.

I'd like to have the chat with you. - Okay. (bright music) - You really are a great dancer. How long have you been dancing? - God, as long as I can remember. I mean, for me, dancing is definitely the most important thing in my life. When I'm dancing, nothing else matters to me. - That's great. So tell me, what are you up to? - Well, I've come to New York with a dream. I wanna dance on Broadway. I wanna be a star. - Well, you certainly have the potential to be a star. You've got all the right material. - What do you mean, right material? - Well, you're beautiful. Sexy, very talented. And I'm on top of all that, you've got all the connections. Doc's willing to help you out and I can help you with some hot numbers. - Well, Maggie, I'd certainly appreciate anything you can do for me. - Okay, then just be honest with me. When I saw you and Mike dancing out there, I saw a lot of electricity. Am I hallucinating or is something going on between you guys? - Well, I think that while dancing, there's a certain chemistry between us, yeah. - Okay, let me rephrase my question. Are you trying to get Mike? - No, definitely not. Don't worry. Maggie. I'm not gonna mess around with Mike. I don't wanna screw up my dream. - Good, I'm glad to hear that because I don't know if you know this, but Mike and I have been going out for a long time and I don't wanna share him with you or with anybody else. Understand? - I understand. Maggie, you have my word. I would never allow anybody or anything to come between me and my dream. - Great 'cause Doc tells me there's this director, Jack, he's got a new Broadway show, he's looking for a lead dancer and he thinks it's great opportunity for you. And I'm willing to choreograph some numbers for you. - Maggie, that'd be great. When do we start? - Right now? - All right. - Come on. We're gonna be in the studio. They'll be sitting over there. Start with your right foot. Let me just teach you the feet first. So you have one, two, three, accent, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, step, step, look left, look front. - Okay. - Okay. Now accents will be on four. Really lift your legs. Don't make them so small like I'm doing now. - Okay. - Just, just do the feet with me. One, two, three, four. One, two. (bright dance music) Let's do a little bigger and arms. So you have one, two, three, push up, four. Four. - All right. - Are you getting it? Ah, I gotta go. I'll see you tomorrow at the studio and we'll work at it. - Okay. - Yeah, buh-bye. - Bye. (bright dance music) - Hey, Julie. - Mike, I wanna talk to you about something. Can you wait for me by the bench for a bit? - Yeah, sure. (bright dance music) Hi, honey. - First of all, don't call me, honey. I just had a talk with Maggie, and I'm not gonna let you cheat on her anymore. - But you know I don't love her. - Don't tell me that. Frow now on Mike, our relationship is strictly platonic. - But I don't like platonic relationships. - Well then that's too bad. I'm not gonna screw up my dream for you, Mike. If you want, I can go and talk to Doc about it. - No, you don't have to tell Doc about it. I don't wanna lose my job. All right, Julie. From now on I'll just be a good friend and a secret admirer. - No, just a good friend. - All right, Julie. Have it your way Bye, Julie. - God, why can't I have both? (bright dance music) (upbeat music) - Doc, that ballerina is a dynamite dancer. - Jack, I'm sure Julie will work out great for your Broadway show. - I certainly hope so. (dramatic music) Doc, remember Sandy? I worked so hard with her, but she just didn't work out. - I remember her. I think as long as you have in your head that you can create stars, you're gonna have this problem. (upbeat dance music) I know you, Jack. You're a good director. Just don't play God. - You think Julie gonna work out for my show. What makes you think that? - I don't think that. I know. She's a star. - I got to see her dance. - Fine, let's go see the audition.

When you're hot, you're hot, and I'm hot. - And this is Juie. - Hi, Jack. Nice to meet you. - Hi, Julie. - I hope you liked my performance. - Oh, I loved it.

(dancers chattering) (upbeat dance music) (doorbell buzzes) - Hi, Maggie. I just wanted to come over to thank you for all that help you gave me at the audition. - You know, you were really great. I think during the dance a star was born. - Yeah, you putting me on or what? - I'm really serious. You were really fantastic. Um, did you hear any good news yet? - Well, sort of. I talked to Doc and he said that Jack really liked to performance, but he wants to see one more dance. - No problem. I'll make up another dance for you. Here, listen to this music. (bright dance music) I'm programming thiis for dance outside of the park. You like it? - Yeah. And Doc mentioned to me that he wanted the dance to be outside. - Great, you wanna learn some of the movements now? - Sure. - All right, the concept is we're out in the middle of the park, right? And the dancers are all in a huddle and you're going to separate. So you'll be coming out of the middle, straight forward, there's a double pirouette, then hit. Okay, so it's gonna be double pirouette, when you hit, the dancers are all gonna separate. - Mm-hmm. - Try it. (bright dance music) Great. - That's great. - Let's do one more time. All right, just pull up a little bit. - Yeah. That's my bad side. Why'd it have to be my bad side for? - All right, you can reverse it. Do it instead on the other side. Good, just shoot your arms to the other side.

I still feel the same way about you as when you walked into the studio that very first day. Remember when I told you you would be my dance goddess? - I remember. - Well, in my eyes, you still are my dance goddess. I still believe in you. - I know how you feel about me, Mike, and I really love you too, but you can't separate me from my dream. I am that dream. - I understand that.
