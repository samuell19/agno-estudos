Starting in 1861, the American Civil War divided the North and the South in a devastating battle. Napoleon III requested that French settlers on the new continent adopt a clear position in this conflict... Strict neutrality Are you cold? I forgot my gloves. Very kind. Are you sure we can trust them? You should've asked yourself that before. I never understood why the French militia sided with the South. I'm not a politician, Mr. De Lisle. When New Orleans fell to the Yankees, the locals were ready to pay a high price for their safety. I didn't know they paid you. Sometimes we forced their hand... But let me reassure you, you're far more generous. What will you do with the money? What are you doing? I'll read. I can't sleep. Go back to bed or you'll be too tired for Christmas. Go on. What's wrong? I had a nightmare. Was it a man's face? Yes. I'm not 12 anymore, Layla. What are you talking about? All this stuff... I don't believe in it anymore. We've always believed in it. SAVAGE STATE December 1863 St Charles County, Missouri The joys of... The joys of love are but... The joys of love are but a moment long The pain... Love! France! Not staying with your sisters? The holidays are always the same. Tell me a story that will take me far away. You don't believe in them anymore. I'm sorry I hurt you the other night. Did I tell you about the Marassa? No. The Marassa... It's the name given to twins, living or dead, in the voodoo pantheon. They are respected and treated like deities. Any family with twins must make offerings to them for fear of being struck down by mishaps. There was once much talk about two Marassa: a little girl and a little boy. Their names were Ezilli and Auguste. They could never be separated. Never. Layla, I've told you, none of that under my roof. I'm sorry, ma'am. I asked Layla. I don't want to know. Where is the key to my husband's study? I'm to lock up when he's at the shop. Does he have anything to hide? Do you love him? My father. It's just meant to intimidate. They're already making arrests in Baton Rouge. Women are disappearing. Miss Davis says this and that... Since when do you talk politics? I'll ask Mr. De Lisle tomorrow. Maybe he'll know more. Listen, Madeleine. He's to marry your daughter. He won't marry anyone if she's kidnapped. They're just stories to frighten ladies. I still have time for the alterations. You'll be fine for New Year's. It's much too tight. That torture instrument was invented to stop us breathing. Look how pretty we were last year. You've changed, Esther. Good. This one... or that one? The smaller ones. How will he be dressed? Mr. De Lisle? As usual with his silly check jacket. Your sister's future husband. What about you, Justine? Never been intimate with a man? I've encountered enough of them. Unlike you. It must be him. Mr. De Lisle is a good man. You'll be happy with him. I'll miss you, Abi. I'll miss you too. Who let you in? I work for Mr. De Lisle. - Are you Abigaelle? - No. Esther. De Lisle is dead. The deal went badly. I'd promised him my daughter's hand. He told me. I'm sorry. What exactly happened? When you deal with these people, unfortunately you must be prepared for bad surprises. With the war, I had to call on smugglers to move my goods. I'm not judging you. What do you want from me? I wasn't paid for my work. The money will be delivered soon. Perfect. I'll be in St Charles for another few weeks. Then I'm sailing for Europe. What would a man like you do over there? I'd advise you to do the same. And leave everything behind? You might as well accept that the Yankees have won the war. You'll lose all you have here. The war isn't my concern. I'm French. From what I can see, you live like a Southerner. Layla is emancipated, I pay her. - Don't compare me to those barbarians. - Your clients? You're a vulgar man, Victor Ludd. If I go to Paris, I promise I'll learn good manners. I wish you... a fine evening. What did he want? One of De Lisle's partners. He won't come this year, he's held up in Europe. What's he doing there? Things are complicated, it's not personal. Maybe he found a woman more to his taste. I don't know what's wrong with her. Go talk to them. He'll come back for a girl as pretty as you. Bless, O Lord, this meal and those who made it. Give bread to those without. Amen. The joys of love are but a moment long The pain of love endures the whole life long Stories to frighten ladies! We'll have to get used to them. To what degree? Couldn't we go up to your room? He doesn't speak French if that makes you feel any better. Five times that sum if you can get us to the next boat for France. Why the sudden hurry? The rest, once we've arrived safely. You, your wife, your three daughters... And Layla. That makes six. Plus at least two porters, depending on your luggage. Eight times the sum. Are you asleep, Abi? No. Do you have any memories of Paris? Some. I mainly remember our grandmother's house. There were blue curtains and it had a funny smell. She was always boiling camphor for her rheumatism. I was scared stiff of her. She'd say: "Why did I only have granddaughters?" You're lucky you never knew her, Esther. When we got to St Charles, Daddy told her of your birth. A few days later, we learned she'd died. The disappointment of a third girl was too much for her! The first thing we'll visit in Paris will no doubt be that witch's tomb. Is your book set in Paris? No, in Touraine. Didn't you already read it? Yes, but it helps me fall asleep. So I'm rereading it. I heard it was sad. The main character's life is so intense that... I seem to vibrate with him. What we're going through isn't enough? I'm scared, Justine. Every morning, this coffee reminds me how long the road still is. Abigaelle isn't awake yet? She's coughing more and more. I'm worried. I gathered some plants. I'll make her a decoction. What would we do without you? What you would do. Keep your remedies. The bond that united the two Marassa was so firmly respected that the village schoolteachers agreed to make an exception for them: Auguste was the only boy allowed to frequent the girls' school. So he would never leave his twin sister. Soon, seduced by his aura, the schoolgirls tried to talk to Auguste. Ezilli became insanely jealous. She put a curse on them. All of the women in the community were struck down by an illness as abrupt as it was strange. The spell immobilized them and prevented them from walking. The bond between Ezilli and Auguste which was so respected now acted as a poison. You think that Victor is my Auguste? He leads your heart away from the truth. Mommy and Daddy? What's wrong? There was a woman... She meant no wrong. You'll go first. That's an order. Hail Mary... full of grace. Blessed art thou among women... I can't! I'll go with you. Be strong. Go on. I've got you. You were right, Esther. All this... It's the best thing that ever happened to us. I too loved someone a long time ago. I mean, truly... Remember that distant cousin who stayed with us after her parents died? Carol? Yes, I was little. I was just old enough. It lasted for several months. Mother surprised us one day in her room. So she left. Why didn't you ever tell me? You were too little, you said so yourself. Did Abigaelle know? When Carol left the house, the color of the furniture grew paler, the sound of the wind seemed weaker. As if the world was starting to go out. So I withdrew into a corner and became closer to Abi. I watched her grow up. People started to say "Abigaelle and Justine". Never "Justine" alone. For me you're Justine. No-one else. Since we left, I've never been afraid for myself, always for her. When I heard De Lisle wasn't coming at Christmas... I felt relieved. Abi could still say no. You said he'd make a good husband. Only to reassure myself. Her path is no longer mapped out. And yours even less so. That's all that matters. Oh, Lord... We can take shelter. Bless, O Lord, this meal and feed our souls. I'm not hungry. Justine... She can't stay like this. We must do something. Why do you always act like I don't understand? I know no-one will be waiting for me in France. I knew it the day Victor paid us a visit. De Lisle is no more. I saw it in your eyes and in Daddy's. A man isn't worth dying for, Abi. No! Any other idea? I forbid you to cry. You never loved him. The only man you love is that God... you don't even believe in. Lord... Your prayers are empty. You can't hear anything at all. What do you hear there? Madeleine... What do you hear? Nothing. You can't hear anything at all. Quiet! Edmond? You didn't hear him. Your daughters? You don't hear them. You'll end up alone... in a world that no longer exists. Alone. With no-one by your side. That is the fate of us all. No. There are things... that are bigger than us. Things that surpass us. But you can't see them. You're crying now too? Over who? Over him? Or over you? Quiet! Trust me. Trust me... There are men outside. The men! They're here! Aim for the cross! I'll do it. Wait till they're close. Now! He's the man I dreamed about before leaving. Victor? He abandoned us. Now you see...
