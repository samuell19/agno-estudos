AT THE PHILOSOPHERS' SCHOOL DIRECTED BY FERNAND MELGAR Who is this? No. Don't climb up. What did I just say? Albiana, there's a hole. You could fall. Say, "Aah." Mommy's here, Emma. Get in! You're going to play ball! Mommy's here, Emma. We're going to play ball together. No, Albiana, you stay there. Your sister is going to get the ball. No. No. Albiana. IT'S NOTHING, EMMA. Albiana! Don't look at her. Albiana! Emma, Emma. Albiana! Mommy's here. Don't hit your sister! Albiana. No, it's me. If I'm not mistaken, Albiana turns 5 on August 15th? Yes. It's important that she start school well and that it goes well. For you, too. For it to go well, we know from experience that it has to start with a certain number of days. We can't just say that we only start on Mondays. It doesn't make sense. I think it's important to have 15 full days with the noon meal. Because... She'll eat lunch here, right? Afterwards, we could consider mornings, and if all goes well, we'll switch to 2 full days. - That's a lot for her. - Do you think it's a lot? Yes, but we'll try it first. - A lot for whom? - For Albiana. Just for Albiana? Or for Mom too? It's hard. Yes, it's the first time. She's my first, too. My first child. You're used to it for the second. So, she's the eldest, the firstborn, as they say. That explains why you worry so much about her. - Right. - It's more difficult. Maybe that's also what makes it... so difficult. Come on. Shall we get the spaghetti? Come, Louis. Come. Louis, shall we put it in the pot? Come. Put it in the pot? Go quickly and see if she's there. She'll come. - Papa. - We'll wait a little. Go ahead. Is she here? Go look out the window. Who's down there? She's not there? Still not. We'll wait a little longer. Huh? - Wait a bit more? - It's broken. You broke it? Why did you break it? Want a new one? Don't grind your teeth. Don't grind them. Is it going to be tough for us with Louis? How will it go? Please tell us about it. What will make him panic is all the people. Too much noise and people. For now, we can't do anywhere public like restaurants and stores. - OK. - We can't go in with him. - He'll go in, but... - When he leaves, he leaves shouting and throwing yogurts and whatnot on the floor. He wants to get it all. He's overwhelmed. It's too much for him. - He panics. - There's a lot of work to do. That's all. I think I got the message. - What do you expect from the school? - Everything. Please explain. For him to learn to speak as soon as possible, for starters. Then what follows, for him to manage to say something like "I hurt," which he can't yet. In terms of diet, does he have allergies? None that we know of, but there are two more complicated things. He still doesn't chew, so you have to blend everything, like purée or soup. Does he put things in his mouth and chew like this? No. When will he come to school? Every day? Is he tired? If he does a morning, for example... He's never tired. - Never tired? - No. So we can take him every day? Until six o'clock in the evening. How are you? So you're not sleeping, huh? We're getting in the car. Here we go. Her foot is stuck. Thanks. There. There. Nice and easy. Where are you now? What we wanted to do today was give - some direction. - Maybe. Right, it's true that... About how we carry her. She's very hypotonic, so that means she's heavy, for starters, but on top of that, she often lets herself go. So... yeah, it's not easy. We always try to pick her up from the pelvis, not just under... But it's hard sometimes. If she goes left or right, we follow. Right, but she can also... - Cry. - That's right. That's new too. It's a new thing these days. - Her crying? - Yeah. Because she... She's better able to express herself. For as smiley as she is, there are also times where she's had it. At least she's able to show us when something's wrong, but it's true that sometimes, it's difficult to... to really know why. Well, it's true that when... In general, we try... to console and comfort her as best we can but we feel powerless at times, I have to say. She also has a tone... She gets a little upset, and you can feel it's a little... She wouldn't move at all before. Lately, with the change, we can see her little hands reaching her mouth, moving around... That's it, that's better. Do you want to do it yourselves later? It's OK if it bleeds a bit or something like that. It can happen from time to time. But normally... There's a small scab there that's healing. That's good. It's got to be... There. That's it, and when you see the little drops, then it's all good afterwards. All right. It's good for about half an hour since there's more than 250. It's never easy to suddenly separate from your child even if school is good for them. - But it's a step further. - Of course. Thinking, "Now it's in others' hands." Yeah. Do they play with the plastic kitchen a lot? I think it takes up space. If not, put it in the hut outside. Is there a lot of stuff there? Yeah, we'd have to sort it out. I should stop soon, my eyes are crossing. So, you're interning now? - Yes. - But you're with us all year? - Yeah. - OK. Then you're done at the end of this year? I graduated this year. - Yeah. - Now, I'm getting... - Finding a discipline? - Yes. OK. When kids come to our class, it's mostly... to learn how to be in a classroom. I always say they're learning the school trade. So they... How to wait their turn, stay seated, and take others into account. Moreover, our students have particularities. Each one has their own. We take those into account as well and go at their pace. Everything is new at the beginning of the year. It's new for the kids and new for the parents. It's new for the intern arriving here as well. At the same time, you still have to be there and do the things we ask of you, so it's very tricky. That's it. - See you Thursday then. - Yeah. - OK. - Nice to meet you. I'm a little apprehensive, but I'm delighted to work here. Yeah, don't hesitate to say so when... When there are issues. RUE DES PHILOSOPHES SCHOOL ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL CLASSES - Is that today's schedule? - Yes, it's today's schedule. I'm sticking it there because I'm not sure it will stay in place. We usually greet them on the chairs. Then they do it? Right, you do it with them. Some can choose, but right now, I don't know... It's day one, they'll be excited. We have no idea how it's going to go. For Léon and Louis, who are two autistic children, it's apparently quite important that we set up rituals with objects to get them used to it. You pick me up at school. Right hand now. Good morning! Can you say hi? Hello. You can bring me them or put them in the bags, and then... Whatever you want. Albiana, are we going to class too? You can come with Dad if you want. You can sit down. Good morning, Léon. Good morning, Léon. See, there are friends here. Can you say hello to him? Oh dear, you have to let her go, Léon. You can say, "Good morning." Good morning, Kenza. Good morning, young lady. Oh, yes. We've prepared them, and we'll give them to you - every day. - Yes? What's up? Bye, bye! Louis, come back into the classroom. Daddy! It's the same at home. - Léon, you stay here too. - See you later. - See you! - Have a nice day! Bye. Bye, bye. I don't think she understood. Goodbye. What are you looking for? Sitting down? OK. - A bird? I'm not sure there is one. - Daddy? Daddy is at home. She's coming back. He's working. Daddy's at home. Yours too. Both of them. Does he work hard? Home. Here, we're at school. Oh, they drank it all again. At school. Is it nighttime? - Daddy! - Shall we go play? Daddy! Yes, yes, easy. Look, do we want some blue? Let's see. Hi there. - Your turn, Albiana. - Chloé? Look at how pretty it is. Wow. Great! - A little more? It's done after. - No! Just a bit more, Léon. No! - No. - Hang on. Yeah, I see you've had it. Let's take off the apron. Léon? You did really well. You can go play for a while. Here you go. You can go play. So, Léon. He didn't want to eat. - Does he eat at home? - Yes. Come here, Léon. She had another bag, no? Or was it the diapers? I thought there were two. I got the diapers right here. Come, Léon. Look. Look, Léon. Look, it's Shaqiri. Who's that? "Switzerland." Look here, "Switzerland." Come on, Léon, say "Switzerland." - Switzerland. - Yes, good. What's this? Albanian. Wait. No, no! That's a tiny Shaqiri. OK. Léon, what did you do? That's why I didn't want to get out my cards. Oh no, really. I've had enough of it. - I'm done. - You're done already? You are done. Wait a minute. Then I'll bring you a drink. OK? Yeah, he's thirsty. Oh yeah, you were thirsty. Until he was 18 months old, Léon developed totally normally, like all children do. He was able to say words when he was a year old, even say two words to make small sentences. He was able to hold a spoon. He could do all these things. All of a sudden, from one day to the next, something changed, and he forgot everything. Absolutely everything. No more words, no more interests. He wasn't there. Really, we could call him, but he wouldn't react. - So, all of a sudden... - From one day to the next. We don't know if it's something that happened to me because I had a significant surgery that got really complicated. I almost died. My husband arrived at the hospital with the four children, maybe not a good idea since I was hooked up to machines. I wasn't in great shape. It's true that just then, all four were in shock. After that, my husband saw... After that, he had a lot of trouble calming down both Léon and Maxime and the two older ones as well. For me, who was away from home for 10 days, I really saw a change in Léon that really struck me when I came home because when I came home, he didn't come to me. He stayed alone in his room for hours. He would stare at an object and nothing interested him. The doctors had explained to us that unfortunately, Léon can very well make a lot of progress and from one day to the next, just like that, go back to 0. We said to ourselves, we hope it won't always go back to zero! We ask them in turn to build a tower with the boxes. They take their turn, and it just has to stay up. It's... It's math, right. After, maybe we have a moment to paint. - Yes, paint. - Care. - Hmm? - Care. How was it yesterday? - It was... Oh, going home? - Yes. Yeah, I was tired. I mean, I think it's hard work. Because I think we still have a big responsibility. But it went well. I wouldn't make it if I were on my own. Yeah, as an intern. Even I wouldn't be able to handle all that by myself. We need to be a team for this class. That's for sure. Come, Léon. It's time for welcoming. We are going to sing the song to say hello. Léon, you can come sit next to Sophie. We're going to sing. We're going to sing. Come say hello to Kenza. We'll sing, and after, we'll talk about new people. Through the open window Hello, hello Through the open window Hello to the day Hello, Albiana Hello, Louis Hello, Kenza Hello, Chloé Hello, Léon And hello to the teachers! Louis, there are a lot of things in this notebook. "Hello, I've added a cap if you can get him to wear it." - And cabbages. - He wants to sing "Cabbages." We'll sing that after. No, Albiana! Whose notebook is this? No hitting, Albiana. Oh. Who is that? Léon. There's a man over there. - Come see. - Who is it? Léon? Is this your notebook? Who is that? It's me. - It's me. - Daddy? - Léon. - Daddy? Did Daddy write this? Bring home. "Hello. Léon was not well after coming home. "He was very thirsty and hungry. "He drank a lot from the bottle and ate a lot, so after, "he wasn't feeling very well. "The fact that he doesn't want to eat and drink during the day "isn't good for him." - He had a bottle yesterday. - Yes, but he doesn't want it. Even with syrup. Oh, shoot! Louis, can you put the school here? The school. Right now, we're greeting. Put it right next to it. Here. Yes, that's next to it too. That's correct too. - School. - Yes, Louis, you're at school. The cabbages! You want to sing that? Now, I suggest that we sing. - So, what do we sing? - Cabbages! Shall we sing "Cabbages?" - Have you sung it? - Yesterday. OK. Do you know how to plant cabbage In the way, in the way Do you know how to plant cabbage In the way that we do They are planted with the feet In the way, in the way They are planted with the feet In the way that we do Oh, she dropped her slippers. It's Albania's turn now. It's Albiana turn. Léon is after. You can sit down. Louis, come here. - After. - You watch. Louis! Louis! This is one of the important ideas to learn. At school, it's one at a time. Don't be mean, Albiana. - No, not allowed. - Go sit. Put it on top. Bravo. Again. The green one. Again. The green one. The green box. - Great, Louis. - Bravo. Your tower is so big! Now, we go, "One, two, three!" Yeah, you got it. Bravo! Bravo! See, that was great! We can break the towers. Louis, what cup did you take? - This one? - OK. There. Louis, are we going back to the little bib? The body doesn't want it. No. When it's not going well... Here, Louis. Here some water, Louis. Go see with him, get some water. Louis? Shall we get water? Shall we go? Careful. So, you put one side in the hole. Wait, let him drink. It's OK, Louis, we're not putting it on. No, that one's for me! This one's for Louis. - Are you OK? - Yes, I'm fine. - What to say? - I don't know. - Where do we start? - With today. Yeah. It'd be nice to have two more arms. - Yes. - Yeah. It's complicated. I don't think it's fair for the kids or for us. We're not starting off well. No, we need someone. They're all so different anyway that... - You have to monitor them. - Yeah. OK. Look at that. We're here! That's right. Are you happy? Why don't you want to? We're at school. We wear slippers here. Now run, and grab your backpack. Are you ready? Be careful not to get stuck. One leg on each side. Perfect, just like that. Colors. Look, what color do you want, Kenza? Red or purple? More this one. Then we'll use purple. That's a good choice. This color you picked is beautiful. Can you open your hand? It's all wet, huh. Yes. You'll do it after. I painted your nails blue. What will your mom say? Huh? Now we put it on the wolf. We'll put it on his belly. Are you ready? Way to go, Kenza. You put your hand down well. We're making Kenza's handprint. Well done, Kenza. You did some painting. You did some painting. Here we go. Put it in his hand. No feet on the table, Kenza. We don't do that. It's not allowed. Hey, Albiana, take it easy. Kenza. Ah, great. Why are you waiting for... This is Albiana's. It's a banana, and it's Albiana's. Be careful! It's over, I get it. Come on, let's sit down to sing. You can choose between the two. I'll choose. You can choose between the two songs. These weeks of school are tiring, aren't they? Yeah? Oh, yes! Do you want some more chocolate? Is it good? It smells good. I'll put it near your nose. Yeah, well done. It smells like chocolate. Chocolate mousse. Well done. Can I help you a little? That's good. That's good. Well done. No, but what Laura was saying... I really need to look you in the eyes, Kenza. That's important to me. Because you're looking at me. Hi there! One, two, three! There. Hi. Stay there for a little while. Where are you going? Did you pee? - Pee. - Are you done? You can leave it open a little bit, and we'll put the diaper on. You're fine on the toilet. Now we have a nice, clean diaper. - Thank you. - Have a good afternoon. - Have a good weekend! - You too, bye! Yes. Are you OK? - No, I'm not OK. - What's wrong? Why? You're not happy? I'm not happy. While he was eating his soup The cat caught the bacon If I run after the cat - More. - Then sing along with me. If I run after the cat, he... will scratch me You're exhausted. I went with Chloe out into the hallway to wait for her mom. I thought she was coming right away. Her mom arrived, a little shocked that she was sitting in her pink chair. Then she said, "Does she spend lots of time in it? How's it going?" I said, "We try to get her out as much as we can, "but we try to watch when we can "and can't, when it's better for her." So I fed Chloé at noon and came back up here a bit later than the others, since we need more time. I brushed her teeth. Then suddenly, her mom was back, standing there in the doorway. By the bathrooms. She immediately pulled Chloé out of the chair as if she needed to hold her. It was pretty physical. Yes, she held her, and her mom broke down in tears in the bathrooms over there. She said she wasn't well and that it was hard, so I stayed there for a bit to talk a little. She really needed to let it out because... Then she said, "What are you going to do now?" I told her, "I'll put her in the ball pit, "or let her roam around on all fours during nap time." She put her in my arms and said, "You're going to stay with Léa. - "It'll all be OK." - That's good. "Mommy's going to be brave. "She's going home." - I was like... - Was she able to leave? Yes. Did you get a diagnosis right away when she was born? Did you immediately know that there was something that was different with Chloé? Pretty quickly. She was super sensitive. She was quickly affected by everything, by noise... Did she cry a lot? No, she would withdraw as if she was in a bubble. We asked ourselves, is she autistic? Hard to imagine when you see her now. Yeah, I used to take her out for a stroll. I would talk to her, like any mother would, and she would look at me and just look away. I felt like I was bothering her. Then a year ago we were diagnosed with mitochondriopathy. Are you making dinner? So you reached this new stage in Chloé's life. Starting school. Everything is changing. It's true, I was impatient for school to start because I knew very well that she would like it and because she needed it. But I also was for myself since my life was on hold until she turned 4 and a half, so... It's kind of like deliverance because she didn't sleep well until she turned three and a half. That meant no nights out, sleepless nights, and no sleeping in. Then, as we separated in June last year, I lived with both girls for a year. Their father takes them 4 days a month. - Every other weekend. - Not weekdays. So, I used to do a lot of sports and couldn't anymore. I didn't frequently see girlfriends, and then... I started having health problems. That was the end of the rope. Just having healthy children is already very demanding. At times, it feels like that's all we do, and on top of that, you're running left and right, no sleep, and... Yes, that's it. What's he doing? What's he doing? Shall we wash your feet? Shall we wash them? They got lost in the foam. Lost. There's a swan. First one to spot the lemon wins. The same one as in the picture. Where's the lemon? Look, Louis. Do you see a lemon? Do you see one? Let's take this one. Can you put it in the basket? There you go. Good job, Louis. Now we're going to buy apples. We need six apples. Three, four... Two more. Five, six! Great! Good job! Oh wow, it's so far! Put it in the basket. Can you put it in? Good job, thanks, great! - We're going to pay. - We're going to the checkout! So, the flour... - or salt? - It's all stuck up there. Good. Give me your little finger. Let's wet it. Are you tasting the lemon? - You know how. - I want to play trucks. We'd like to say, "Nice, done like a leader." Can we say that? I want to play at the door. No, we're in the kitchen. The kitchen. We're in the kitchen and tasting the lemon. In the kitchen! Can you show me how you taste the lemon, Louis? Come on. Come on! Be brave! Good job! Good job, Louis. No, keep it in your mouth. Good job! That's it. We're done with the lemon. More? Good job, Albiana. No, don't touch that. - We're going to taste lemons. - Albiana, quiet. Albiana, please stop, or you'll leave. Hey, that's enough. Squeeze! Squeeze harder! We're going to taste. You're misbehaving, Albiana. You're punished now, bye. You're punished. Chocolate is hazelnut with apple, lemon, and sugar. It's cool. Do the first part well. No, just roll it. More. Good job. That's it! Look Kenza, a snail. Push. Good job. One snail for Léon. When she was born, they saw when doing the blood tests that she had one chromosome 5. It was hard to accept. We've never... We never... We always saw her as a normal child, not with one chromosome. We'd do anything for her. Even if sometimes we exaggerate and... You exaggerate? What does that mean? Well, if she's with her father, it's even worse. Her father lets her do everything. Like a normal child, she also needs to be told "stop," "no," that she must be quiet, that there are things she can't do. Yes, since I had my second, I've started - to set some limits for her. - OK. - How old? - She's one. It's hard... When we came home from the hospital, she got slapped. The little one. - It hurt. - Yes, it's hard. I never thought I would also love the second one, so my husband and I decided that until Emma can defend herself, this is what we'll do. She goes with my in-laws, and we'll see her during vacations. All right. Until she learns how to defend herself. Because... it's hard. Do you notice any special needs with motor skills for your daughter, for example? She can't go down the stairs. Yes, I wanted to discuss that as well. She can't do that. She throws herself. She throws herself down the stairs. She doesn't know. She should not be allowed to go alone. If she's alone for two minutes, she gets on the couch and jumps. She's not afraid of anything. - Does she sleep alone? - No, she sleeps with me. - In her bed, but in my room. - OK. She's beside you in her bed. I wouldn't dare leave her. There's never been a night you slept without her? No, that'd be too much for me because she often has seizures - while she's sleeping. - Yes. Epileptic seizures. In another room, I wouldn't know when she'll get them. You don't get a full night's sleep? No. - You don't sleep well? - No. For 5 years? - For? - For five years? For five years. It's been five years. Right, Albiana. Up to now, you talked about it with your family and doctors since they were there. - And that's it. - That's it. - I couldn't. - Why? There was something within that wouldn't come out. I had... a block. I couldn't do it. - Are you afraid of being judged? - I was afraid... - That they'd judge Albiana? - That. That people would look at you sideways? They'd stare. It was hard for me. Yeah. They wonder. They don't understand. No. Sometimes we can very well tell them and then... Starting school is also a step towards that because the specialized school isn't the village school. It's just as difficult. Yes, that's... Albiana! - Look what you've done, come here. - It's OK, don't worry. - Albiana! - It's out of paper. But you can take some. It's clean. Albiana gave it to you. But you've had some tough conversations. It's a relative. They... Albiana. They had gone and told other relatives that I had a child who wasn't normal. It was hard to find out because Albiana is normal to me. Regarding Albiana's own teaching project in class? Our main goal is for her to be able to get into an academic rhythm, become a little schoolgirl, for her to throw less and exhibit better behavior in relation to her in-class socialization. We're a little helpless as far as this behavioral side goes that interferes with her potential learning. There are some of us who are wondering how to move forward with her. - OK. - It's also an issue of the parents who make a point of saying that she's a normal child. That brought different things mind. I wondered if the parents were Muslim since she doesn't eat pork. And I thought, "Is this girl..." As far the community goes, what's it like having a disabled daughter in the family? Does it go back to things like, "Inshallah, it was God's will." Are there things like that happening that make it even more important to say she's normal, or else the community rejects you? Do they believe that? I think at home, she hears a lot that she's like other little girls, and at the same time, she sees that her sister doesn't live with them like any other siblings do. I'm sure how much she realizes this. Sandrine? Yes, so... What's left to say? One idea would be psychomotricity for Albiana. Individually. I think it'd be more suitable individually for now. Let's go in. Look. So. You found the house. Look. Do you remember the game? What do you have to do? You heard a noise. It's Fabienne's students making noise. You're so high up now! Go ahead. Oh, watch out! You fell down. "Boom." You went "boom," Albiana. Look at me. Let's do it again. We'll redo it. Go ahead, again. Come here. Come with me. Go ahead, good. Go this way. Here, look. No, you're going to the other side. Taking a shortcut? Ah! Stop at the bottom! Stop. You have to slow down, Albiana. Albiana, we stop. Are you tired? We'll go around on the boat. Come. All aboard, Grammy, Grammy All aboard, Grammy out on the water When there are some very big waves, the boat splashes in the water Slow down! Yeah, great! You're working hard. Look, like this. Press down. Goodbye, Sandrine. Goodbye, Albiana. Hi, Louis. Good morning, Madam. Good morning. Hi, Guillaume. There's some wind, it's chilly! Work hard. Come on, Natalia. Good. No hitting, Louis. No, Louis. Good morning, Louis. How was it? It went fine. - Good morning. - Coming to school? Good morning. Are you coming? Put on your backpack. That's it! Let's go. No, you're not sitting properly. Léon! Calm down, or I'll move you to another seat. Louis, come and sit down. Sit down, Louis, or you can't play boxes. So, today... So, so! - So! - We're going out into the hall. - Let's go. - You'll work with the boxes. Go ahead. Come, Louis. That's it. Goodbye. Goodbye. You want to be alone? - Is it over? - Sit on the little bench. - Is it over? - No, not yet. Sit down. Wait until I tell you. Do you want to go back to the boxes, Louis? The boxes! If you want to play, you have to be quiet. You have to be quiet to play. Sit down, Louis. Green box! Next... Wait, I haven't said it yet. Are the boxes over? No, not yet. It'd be great if you played, but you have to be quiet. Oh! It fell! Louis, do you want your turn? I'm going to break the tower. - The tower that can break. - Yes, you can break it after. But first, you must be silent. You have to sit in silence. Yes, quiet when sitting. Give me your hand? One... two... three! Again! Louis, let's go back to the boxes. OK? But first you have to sit in the chair. Bravo Albiana, you did a good job! - What color do you want, Léon? - Red. The red one is small. What about you? Brown. Go ahead, take the brown one. I'm taking green. Louis is drawing circles. Very good, Chloé. Very good! Good work! More songs. Yummy, Mommy and Daddy's little jars. This is our first time eating together, Léon. Go ahead. Show me how you eat. It's salad. She eats well... Sorry, Louis. Albiana's eating well! Good, Chloé. Good. I want to eat on my own. On your own? Did you hear that? - Go ahead, then, good luck. - At least he's trying. Good job, Louis. You have to eat some gratin. Great job, Léon. That's good. No, that's OK. Good, right? This meat is good. That's good. Do you want some more? He's going to eat for now, but later... Want some more? Louis, what do we sing? - The little singing teeth. - Scrubbing the little teeth. Scrubbing the little teeth Scrubbing the little teeth Scrubbing the little teeth with the toothbrush! Now the water! That's it, Louis. All good. Do you know what we're doing next? We're going to put on bandages and ointment. You can't touch it. You're hurting your hands, sweetie. We can even put on ointment. Ready? Come here. Look. We do as the doctor said. What did he say? Otherwise we have to go back to the doctor. Because you bite a lot. You shouldn't bite. You can't do that, sweetie. See, it says "Stop." It says "stop" for hands in mouth, sweetie. No, it says "Stop." No, you can't do that. It'll hurt you. Let's put this on. You got a boo-boo, sweetie. There. This way, you won't play for a while, and it will heal. There. Look, it's good, Louis. That's great. Put it on? There, good job. That's great. Now it doesn't hurt anymore. See, it doesn't hurt. Here. We're not at the doctor's. We're being doctors here. After, play. Yes, later, after your nap. OK? You said that you found out about the diagnosis when he was 2 years old. He burned his hands. - Second degree burns. - It was long, huh? We had to go to the hospital every day - to get the bandages changed. - For how long? About a month and a half. That was the bandages. Then about 3 months. He had started nibbling on pears and apples. He had been chewing for 2 weeks. Then, after 3 months of bandages, nothing. Basically, since the day of the accident, we could only feed him yogurts. That's all that worked. The first week, we thought, "It must be the shock." - He got burned on a stove? - Yeah. Since early January, we've been back into regular motherhood. That's when you notice things aren't going back to normal. He wouldn't play anymore. He hasn't gone back to making towers or doing puzzles or Legos. He withdrew more and more. Yeah, and he talked less. Same for gestures. He wouldn't wave goodbye. Did doctors connect it to anything? - No. - OK. And you? Yes, we've made a connection. With what we've told you, we found one. Yes. Since school started, there's been a dramatic change as far as his behavioral stability goes. When he comes home, he's full of happiness. We can tell that he's really enjoying all of it. Shall we go? Shall we go into the snow? Into the snow! It's so great! It's snowing! Are you good? Hold on tight. - Done! - Are you done? - Swing. - No, this one is Albiana's. Come here, take another. Swing. When reading all the reports, is everything more or less related to this hand-burning episode, or... did that unfortunately happen at the same time, but it's not related? With what the parents told us, we agreed. Now, I think the doctors didn't necessarily agree. Was there some kind of susceptibility that triggered this event, - or... is it unrelated? - If there's a disorder on the autism spectrum or a form of autism, it's not related to a trigger event. Some things can be seen early-on in development, and maybe if we ask the specialists who work with this child, they'll tell you that there were some developmental things. Well, I think he's doing well, but there was a lot of anxiety. He puts his hands in his mouth more, and then it gets all irritated and infected. But there are no after-effects from the burn? No. Just like that, and we put the corn on it. We tell Stefania, "All good!" - It's hidden. - It's hidden! Should I look for it? Should I look for the yellow one? Where's the yellow? - Help her out. Where is it? - Will you help me? OK, Vanessa, help us. Well then, I'll help you too. Where's the yellow? Yellow. Wow! You're so good, Louis. Good job! I'm hiding it for Louis. - Hey. - Hey! Don't peek, Vanessa is hiding it. Not yet, we're waiting. Vanessa is hiding it. It's ready! - You can look now. - Where's the yellow? And the blue. Look for it, Louis! It's hidden pretty well, huh? Ah! - You found the blue one! - Good job! - Where's yellow? - Let's put it here. - You're so good at this! - You found both. The yellow too? Wow! - Bravo, Louis! - After that, we put on music. We'll play some music if you want. Through the open window hello, hello Through the open window Hello to the parents And hello to the teachers Welcome, everyone, to your first parents' meeting. For the first time in our class. I have to tell you that we've noticed a huge difference. Now, we all do the greeting together. Every child is here sitting with us. In our profession, we're lucky to witness changes and improvements and all this progress your children are making day by day. With Léon, for example, I can see that he feels things even more now, and he can say them. We had been told that Léon would never speak. So, you should never give up. For me, every day is a new step. - Yes, every day. - One step, another step. It's not like he progresses and then falls back anymore. Now, it's always like this. We can see it in Kenza too. When the minivan driver shows up, there's that response that starts showing, you know. She's all happy when she sees him. It's impressive since at the beginning, she would shut down. Yes, it's great. Also, you giving her a little morning snack when we don't forget to pack one is really great because we know she at least has that during the day. We think, "Ah, well..." We know that you do this kind of thing, and we feel less stressed or less guilty when we don't have the time or chance to do it. That's cool too. What's all that? What do you mean by that? I don't know if you can hear me, but I know you're listening because you squeeze your little fingers. You know, the first time you cried, we cried with joy, I promise. We said to each other, "Hey, her first self-expression." You never cried in your first two years. Nothing. Then it was... Wow. We were with your mom, and we hugged and cried like never before. We thought, "That's a good start." You were crying with pain, and we were crying with joy... to have something... to at least have a reaction from you. Thank God. Take off your jacket. So... I suggest that Albiana do the orange pom-pom because it's Tuesday. Good morning, Léa. - I'm here. - That's right. Good morning, Albiana. See, she's working for Mommy today. It's a performance for Mom. Chloé, give your hand. Say "Hello, Chloé," Albiana. - Yes. - Good job. Let's say hi to Mommy. - Hello, Mommy. - Hello. Give your hand. Hello, Louis. - Hello. - That's really, really good. Bravo. So, you are at school. Now, there's the schedule. Show mom, but you come and put it on the board. Now you do the schedule. Bravo, yes. Great! Then the children have snack time. We put it next to it. There you go. That's great work. Mommy also thinks you're doing well. Let's just explain to your mom that the first few times you did the greeting, you threw all the cards on the floor. We never said no because she'd always pick them back up. Almost immediately. She doesn't do that anymore now. You can return to your seat. Look, I'm here. Look, I'm here. It's like that at home too - when we want her to sit. - She has moments. It's not all the time, but snack time is different today. Yeah. Like I said. She's always like that. Now, calm down. We're not OK with that. Neither is Mommy. I think that before, we could leave her be, but we often have to watch her now. - Does she ever hit you? - Yes. - Does she bite you too? - Yes, quite often. - Every day. - Here too. At home, every day. How do you react? Are you able to explain to her that you're not OK with it? It's mostly when we change her. She kicks us. I've got bruises all over my legs. This summer, I don't know what I'll do - to wear skirts. - Your glasses fell. I try to calm her down in ways other than shouting because if I shout, it gets worse. If I hold her like that, she hits me with her head. I feel like I'm being hit every day. Sometimes I can't even carry her anymore because I'm so tired of her hitting. She's quite strong, too. It's like an adult were hitting me. After, this is how it is. All of a sudden, it's all out. - She calms down. - I'm not holding her back But, well... I need you to see that not only is your daughter progressing and that she's able to learn things but also that there are some tough moments for us. But, for example, if there's a time where things are too complicated with Albiana for me, I say: "Listen, Léa, you have to take over," and Léa then takes over. - Is she pregnant? - I think you could say that. She has to be very careful... Yes, we also protect our coworkers, you know. If I were pregnant today, I don't know what I would've done. Roll over. OK? Let's roll all the way to the mirror. Hop. Go, turn. Let's roll. You don't want to be on your stomach. Good. Push off with your hand. You really don't want to, eh? No, you have to do it. That's it. Just like that, perfect. Perfect. Great, Kenza. Now put your head in the middle. Straighten up. Raise your head. Raise your head. Good. Hey, Kenza. Let's raise your head. Raise your head, Kenza. Go on. Good job. Good job! That's perfect. Hello. This morning, I went on the potty. I took a poo in the toilet. Yes . - Great. - The teachers are happy. Yes, us too. I am too. After that, I did some painting. Yellow. Hello. That's why she had paint on her fingers. - It's great she's using the toilet. - That's a good thing. We're making progress. Feeling dizzy, huh? Mommy's tired. Let's put you in your chair, but I can't sing anymore after that. I'm all out of breath. Here we are. Oh, yeah! Should we swing, Kenza? Should we? Oh, the swing, the swing, the swing What a sweet, a sweet story You carry me away up high To be among the birds Oh, the swing, the swing, the swing What a sweet, a sweet story You carry me away up high To be among the birds Let's open it. Hang on. Knock, knock, knock. See you later, Chloé. See you later. Are you ready? Click-clack, peanut, green mouse, say cheese! He was a little man Say, our pig ate a lot today. Did you see that? Yes, he's always hungry. What does he have to eat? - Tomatoes? - No. - Carrots? - No. Eating hand. He wants to eat your hand? No, that's not possible! - No. - No. Chloé will take her first steps soon. Right, Chloé? But today I saw something that looked like an attempt... Something I haven't seen before. She wants so badly to be able to be autonomous that... Yeah, that would... That would be great. Is it a congenital problem or a problem that occurred after birth? No, it turns out it's genetic. In the majority of cases, it's transmitted by the mother. But then again, a lot of people said to me, "You can't feel guilty." I never did. That's good. It never occurred to me that I was guilty or responsible for anything. - That helps a lot, too. - Yes, of course. It's true. Well, yes, but many parents feel guilty in one way or another while you can't do anything. - That's how it is. - Yeah. When we got the diagnosis when she was one, they told us that she could die at any time. - Right. - And then... That she may never speak and that they were skeptical that she could ever stay seated. It hurt so much when the doctor told me that I thought I would stop asking questions, and that in the end, it was too much of a burden on me. At the end of the day, they didn't know anything. We started setting up a lot of things. - What is it, Chloé? - Toast. Toast! That's great, you're asking for a piece of toast. It's true that I put a lot of things into perspective as a result. That's also slightly why... her father and I started clashing a little bit. Since I was always with her, feeling so exhausted, I thought, "Why are we getting angry "over not vacuuming, or... "I don't know, all sorts of stupid things." "The fridge is empty," "Why do we care?!" Or... "Loosen up." Basically, stop acting so uptight like this. I can't get back into that swing, get ready, run, fetch, bring it back, and miss all those nice little moments. Despite it all, not knowing how long she has left... I can never lose sight of that. And also... I'm trying to learn to accept that one day, she might not be here anymore. But we'll have so many beautiful memories. Right? Our little ray of sunshine who makes us boats in the water. Chloé really teaches us how to live one day at a time. On three! Don't start until then. One, two, three! Go, Léon! Oh the croco, oh the croco, oh the crocodiles From the banks of the Nile they left, say no more about it Oh the croco, oh the croco, oh the crocodiles From the banks of the Nile they left, say no more about it. Chloé, what are we singing? The...? Chloé, come closer, I can't hear you very well. Léon, let her do it, she can do it alone. Come here. Little hands that clap Little hands that clap Little hands that clap On your marks! Get set! Go! THE ELEMENTS OF "SELF-DISCOVERY" THROUGHOUT THIS INTERNSHIP, I WAS ABLE... Next stop: Yverdon-les-Bains. To do a short evaluation of the near-end of your internship. You've been here since August. What's the difference between today and your first Tuesday? - Your first week? - A lot of differences. First, I think it would be the background noise. All the noise. Like I explained when I started, at the end of the week, I would be on the train, close my eyes, and I could hear each child's screams in my head. As if it were going away. Now I don't have that anymore. I don't even hear it anymore. That's it, really... The first week, I thought, "How will I do all year?" The diapers, too. That was difficult. It's still not, "Yes, we're changing diapers!" I just have to do it, and it's much better for the child than if we just left it and let it leak and get worse. Better do it when you have to, basically. What do you prefer doing in your work here? I like, for example, recreational activities or when you have to play with them. I like that. It's nice to see the children... actually making progress because you're there for them. You see? Yeah, it makes me happy. A session like this afternoon's story where Louis could stay, well, you were the one there. It's really great. I'll miss them. One, two, three! One, two, three! We're going to take the bus. - Hi, Léon. - Hello. Are you ready too, Léon? Are you going again? - The bus. - Yeah! - Are you nervous? - Yes, my heart's pounding. - A little? - A little bit, yes. First time? First time, yes. First time with Kenza. - Great. - Yes. Camping is good. Yes, it's good so that she can discover her little town. This is natrium bicarbonate. Put five drops in a small bottle cap and collect it with this to inject it. I don't like to take this one there's a risk of using more. - OK, fine. - This is for nighttime. - It's ready. - Yes, sounds good, Chloé. There. See you tomorrow! We can say see you tomorrow! Have a good trip. Yeah! You're singing! Yeah! The famous river... Are you OK? I've got you. Put your arm out. That's it. I'll be sleeping here. The AC is making noise there. Right next to Chloé.

Did you see? You didn't know it was a girl. I was certain it was going to be a boy, I'm good at that. I said... I don't remember, but I know you said, "I don't know." You should know it's not a big deal if he cries. He's allowed to, he's new. It's no problem. The other boys were just like that last year. OK? Oh, you're not happy. empty the bag, OK? That's it, Chloé, good. Sit next to Chloé, Kathia. You're so good at drawing! Look at how well he draws. Wow, that's great. Great. Keep going. I'll give you another color. Look.
