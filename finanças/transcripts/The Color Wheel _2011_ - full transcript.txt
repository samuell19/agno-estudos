Nice shirt. How am I being unpleasant? Well, you're not being unpleasant, but you are making this an unpleasant situation, instead of making it an erotic one like I am. Yeah, really erotic, Colin. I mean, again, you don't seem to grasp that we could be talking about forty-eight, maybe seventy-two hours without me here. So, you might want to, want to think about some passion occurring. Like, immediately. Why are you even helping your sister? I thought you and your parents hated JR. We do, but, you know, she asked for a favor and I said yes. You know, you don't have any siblings so you have no frame of reference for what it's like when one of them asks for a favor. Like I said, two maybe even three days so this is definitely a great opportunity for us to share something wonderful. Now come on, can we please stop arguing and start enjoying one another's company in a very real way? We can't even negotiate for a handjob or something? What do you suggest I do with this massive black man sized erection I made special just for you? That's racist. What did we talk about with you saying racist jokes? That you love it. By the way, that was a compliment to any black man with a large penis. Which is all of them, so... Colin, you should change your pants. Those are dirty and ugly. - Colin! - Is your sister here already? What? No. You didn't just hear her yell my name. Which is actually what I would like you to be doing, during the passion we'll be sharing momentarily. I'll walk you out. - Colin! Let's go. - Oh, don't you look like a movie star. Oh, thanks, so do you. So, this must be important for you to drag your brother into it. It is actually, it's college related. You probably wouldn't understand. I heard you were living with your professor and dating him and then he threw you out. Goodbye Colin. Goodbye JR. It's been a pleasure. Yeah, the movie star I meant was the bathtub monster in The Shining. Have a nice day. - Blow me, JR. - Done. Goodbye, my sweetness. I'll call you. She gave me the finger. - Or me. - Gave us the finger. No maybe it was you. Probably you. How long have you guys been together? - Like three and a half... - Months? - Years. - Ugh! - But it feels like at least four. - Here, you drive. Please. - What? - Please. - What the hell is all this crap? - This isn't crap. How am I supposed to enjoy driving on this trip if this car is full of all this garbage? What the fuck is this thing, why is this in the driver's seat? Oh my god, give that back. Colin, give that back. What is this? Stop it. You're so annoying. Give it. What do you mean what is this, this is my vision board? What the fuck is a vision board? What is this giant piece of shit covered in pictures of you? They say if you put your hopes and dreams out on paper they're more likely to come true. - Who says? - Experts. Jesus Christ. Why does it say the word Moses next to a drawing? - That's my celebrity crush. - Look, I got an idea. You wouldn't understand, you have no hopes and dreams. How about we forget about all of this, we can just stay here tonight, have dinner with mom and dad, we can first thing in the morning. That way we don't need to drive when it's, when it's dark out. - Colin, what do you think I want to do? - I think we should stick – Leave right now. Leave right now, that's what I was going to say. No! I have to pee. - Can I help you? - Hello, kind sir and God bless. We are gonna need one room for the night, the cheapest room you've got please. The cheapest room we have is a smallest. It's a single. And we don't allow co-eds to cohabitate unless they are married. That shouldn't be a problem. We're brother and sister. No funny business here. Brother and sister? That's foul. And in a way that's even worse than if you were a couple sinful, sinful kids up to no good. Um, ha well, actually we are married. We have the same last name because we are married. Yeah, ha ha. We're just aspiring comedians and like to make jokes. Taking our act on the road here. In public places. Look at us now. Uh, yeah, take out your ID my precious husband. - Yeah, let me see some ID. - Yeah, we have a wonderful marriage. - Sometimes I... - So happy. So happy. I can't stop smiling. Most of the time, my face hurts. Oh my God, he's such...do you think he's fooled? Of course he's not fooled. Just shut up and let me do the rest of the talking. - Are we in, like, the... - Don't say anything else! How come you ain't got wedding rings? This actually is a wedding ring. - And I sold mine, to buy... - He sold his to buy drugs for kids. - Medicine. For sick children. - In Chernobyl. In some other country. There's a lot of sick kids that are, we've given them so much they're pretty much ungrateful at this point. You kids look an awful lot alike. You sure you're married? Who wouldn't want to marry and live with this person, the rest of their God given life? I remember when my wife and I we got married. I was fifteen, she was fourteen. Had our first child seventeen, and sixteen. And, sixteen is a, uh, good age for a girl to have a baby. That's what I hear. But, you don't need to hear about my life story. No, we don't. Yes, we would love to hear your life story as soon as we get some rest. Alright. Well, you pay the door at the end. You need to leave a twenty dollar deposit. I don't have any cash. You better make it forty. Wait a minute. Let me see you two lovebirds kiss. - Why would we have to kiss? - Because, our policy. - I need to see married couples kiss. - Is that an actual sign that you use? Yes. Did you make that sign by hand just before we got here? - No. - What would Jesus do? - He would sleep in the car. - No, He wouldn't. Sure, uh, why would we do anything other than express our love and devotion. Bless you, and keep you. Very nice. How do you feel about that? I get to do that every night of my life, and possibly after death, if you believe in that, which I do, of course. - Very nice. Have a good night. - Thanks. God bless. And God bless. Was it really that bad pretending to kiss me? The sad thing is you're not the first boy to throw up after kissing me. It's something that I ate. Something awful, awful that I ate. I don't think I've thrown up in like, twelve years. Isn't that kind of an impressive record? What is that, like something you have to brag about. Like that's a skill? Like, oh, I have a superior digestive system. Reward me please. Oh, I have good hearing. I taught myself to have good hearing. Ridiculous. Can you smell this Bible? Get that out of my face I just threw up. Wait a minute. "If a man mates with an animal he shall surely be put to death and you shall kill the animal." That doesn't seem fair to the animal. Wha – did you bring all those gargoyles here? You couldn't be away from them for three days? Well, I'm not permitted to display them when Zoe is around. She thinks they watch her sleep. Gross. Who would want to watch her sleep? I just this one my trip to Puerto Rico and I've been excited to display it. Wait, why were you in Puerto Rico? Were you deported? Mom and dad got a family vacation package and they took me and Zoe on this really nice all expenses paid vacation. Why didn't they bring me? I totally could have come. Because they don't like you. And I think the exact words were: "I want this vacation to be relaxing and pleasant," "not a humungous pain in the ass like it will be if JR is around." And I can honestly say at no point did anyone ever say it would have been more fun had you been there. You know what, I'm sure mom and dad probably just didn't invite me because they know I don't like the ocean. Yeah, I'm sure that's it. Of course I wouldn't want to have fun on a cruise. Yeah 'm sure that's it. It wasn't a cruise, by the way. It was a beachside resort with a pool. Have you ever sat in a pool and looked at the ocean? It's lovely. Why wouldn't they want me there? I have so many wonderful things going on. First of all, I'm their only child, I've got that over you. Second of all I'm a wonderful person. Third of all.... That is so nonsensically untrue I don't even know where to begin. The oldest, the first child is always the favorite. Right but the first child's not the only child. Only child means only child. Number two I'm a wonderful person, number three I'm an aspiring actress. Yeah fourth of all, you know what I think it is? That nobody wanted to listen to you talk about living with your professor in a den of sin. I don't think anybody wanted to hear about that. I think we wanted to go down there and concentrate on the breeze and the pina coladas and not your emotional turmoil and your pathetic shambled life. You are such a jerk. You know, I should have thrown up all over this floor to prove my point that Jesus freak clerk. And what point might that be? That you love him? That I think his policies are bullshit and this pile of vomit on the floor is a representation of my feelings. Well if you'd thrown up all over the floor, we'd have to sleep in a room with vomit all over the floor. Did you ever think about that, Einstein? No. No buddy, I didn't. But if I have to do it again, I'm going to throw up all over the floor in the morning. You're throwing up all over the floor, not just in one spot? - Yes, absolutely. - That's pretty impressive. I am going to stand on the bed and spin around. It's going to be like a lawn sprinkler, but with puke. Just, everywhere. - Shhhh. Oh my god. Do you hear that? - Hear what? I don't hear anything? - Is that what I think it is? - Maybe you do have better hearing. Shhh. Having loud sex in a motel room. So cliché. I bet they're fat. I should go tell the, tell the manager. It's probably him having some gross sex with a blonde woman. This has got to be against the policies of this Christian establishment. A minute ago you said you wanted to throw up all over the room in response to his hateful policies, now you want to snitch? - Well this is different. - How is this different? - Because this affects me. Me! - Me. I'm tired. I'm not going to be able to sleep with this noise. Well lucky for you, I think it just ended. - How sad. - He was quick. Quick to cum. - Colin. - What? - Do you believe in ghosts? - I don't know. No. I wonder if there's, like, gay ghosts. And if there's gay ghosts, do you think they go booooo! - I'm going to say goodnight now. - Is that seductive? You missed quite the continental breakfast. Shhhh. I burned the roof of my mouth on a piece of toast. I didn't even know that was possible. Colin, just stop it. Alright, alright I'm up. Stop. You are so annoying. You and Zoe didn't tell mom or dad why I needed you this weekend, did you? - No. - Okay, good. - They don't care about you anyway. - Yes they do, stop it with that. Why wouldn't they care about me I'm a wonderful person. Oh, I don't know. The fact that you were living with some creepy gross professor man nearly twice your age, and he threw you out, and you dropped out of school, and now you have nowhere to go, and you're picking me up, and it's just everything at the same time. Alright, alright. I'll have you know that that creepy professor man that you're referring to is one of the top broadcast journalism professors in the entire state, so I am clearly on a fast track to a career in broadcasting. Yeah, he's such a, such a great professor. That's why he got you all those great jobs, all those wonderful auditions, all those pathetic events you're always going to with your dumb little headshot. Yeah, you have so many jobs now because of him. That's why nobody likes you, because you are too successful to hang out with us. You're so successful. I forget. I forget sometimes how successful you are because that's all we can talk about when we're sitting around the dinner table at night is what a success you are. Wah wah, you're so funny Colin. You know, I don't understand. Of anyone you could have asked, why me? You must know two dozen people. I don't want to involve more people than is necessary. I don't need a million people to help me carry a few stupid boxes, I just need one person. Yeah, is that because you want to keep it hush hush or because you're ashamed and embarrassed at how this is ending? Fuck you, if you really didn't want to come you could have stayed at home with your gross girlfriend. No, I'm here. I do want to come. Look, I'm here. I'm having a great time. I'm trying to bring you on a fun trip. I am having a great time, this is a fun trip. - I'm having a lovely time. - Oh yeah, I'm sure. You just threw up the first, five minutes on it. Well, that's your fault. I just, you know, of anyone, I'm just shocked that you asked me. My fault. I thought you said it was food poisoning. Whatever. There must be, there must be a reason you asked me and I don't know what it is yet. Colin, I asked you because I trust you with my stuff. And mainly because you have nobody important to tell. - How was the room? - Oh it was great. I'm sure if all goes according to plan we'll be naming a child after the Avalanche Express Lodge in about nine months. God bless you. Hello, I heard somebody having a good night last night, if you know what I mean. I'm a wholesome blond woman, beautiful blond woman by day, and an Aryan sex machine by night. Walkin' and talkin', sashaying out of the parking lot, because I didn't have multiple orgasms, I only had one. - What's this all about? - Oh, uh, nothing. - Just making small talk with the locals. - Can we go now? Yes, but can you drive this time? I'm like, so tired. - I'm not used to getting up this early. - It's eleven o clock. That's early. Fine, but just stay awake so I don't have to drive by myself. Yeah, I'll stay awake. I'll entertain you with my wit and charm the entire ride. I promise. - I am going to go use the bathroom. - Gross. It's not that I've given up, there's just more important things to me right now than doing whatever I feel like every day, like you do. Oh, so you're just going to live with mom and dad and your gross girlfriend in an attic the rest of your life. Is that your idea of success? I have a low cost of living, it's called smart business. It's not smart business. It's pathetic and boring. - Why do you care? - Why do I care? Because you could be doing something fun with you life. I am doing something fun. Living somewhere interesting and not in mom and dad's attic. I am doing something interesting. No you're not. You're doing something you're okay with doing. That's so sad, that's like the worst existence. Wait, what? I've known you your entire life and you never, ever said that you wanted to work, wait, what exactly do you even do? You see, you don't even know. I write the copy for focus group presentations. It's actually really fun and cool. Focus groups. Oh my god, I'm bored already. Whatever happened to being a writer, isn't that what you went to school for, Colin? No, no. You can't just be a writer. It's too pathetic to be an aspiring writer. It has a negative connotation to it. But you're so witty. I'd rather be a successful tollbooth operator than an aspiring anything. That's so bleak and pathetic. Yeah, I guess maybe a better idea is to do what you do, sleep until noon, leave the house three days a week, deplete your savings while you chase down pathetic weather girl jobs. What are you talking about? It's my money. It's my money and I can do whatever I want with it. Yeah your money and it's never coming back. Just spend it, it's never going to come back. Auditions take a lot of time. It's not like I'm doing nothing. Yeah, a lot of time. A couple of hours a day in between all the day dreaming and the napping. You leave the house three days a week, I got news for you. I don't know why you think you're so special. - Because I am special. - I don't know why... you think you're special that you don't have to work and everybody else does. You make me, mom, dad and my girlfriend sick to our stomachs every single time you come up in conversation. He's a jolly good patron, he's a jolly good patron, He's a jolly good patron, A special birthday guy. A special birthday guy! I'm going to eat this. But only because I am very hungry and it looks delicious. I have to go somewhere and change this, I am not wearing this. Why? It's a perfectly nice shirt. You look lovely. Colin, I look like I had an abortion on my shirt. I can't wear this. Oh, yeah. It does kind of look like that. - Is anybody out there? - Just me. Ok, how does this look? Does this look better? Well, it has less food on it, if that's what you're going for. Could you just get me the grey one with the collar from the car please. I thought I was watching the door because it won't lock. Colin, go, please. Thank God. - Hey, I got - ugh! - Just get in here. What, haven't you ever seen a pair of beautiful bosoms before? Yeah, not your. Jesus Christ, no thanks. Don't be modest. - You should learn modesty, a little bit. - You should learn modesty. Took you long enough to come back here, what were you doing out there? I'm going to throw up if you keep talking. Buying a slurpee? Fasten this for me, please. I can't reach it. Fasten my shirt, asshole. Stop it, goddamnit. God, I hope I gave the professor the clap. - I hope you didn't. - I probably didn't. I don't actually know what the clap is. It just sounds old timey and itchy. Sorry... does this collar look weird, Peter Pan-y or good? I don't get the reference. Okay, there. - Okay, does this look better? - I don't know. Whatever. Do I look barely legal, in a mature way? I don't know, who cares. This isn't , isn't even worth it. Yes it is. I want to look good. I want him to see what he is missing. You're going to move a bunch of your shit out, you shouldn't be dressed in sexy heels and shorts. Oh, so I do look sexy. Okay good. You should be wearing jeans and one of those moving belts, with the... guys wrap around their abdomen. You think I should be wearing a tool belt to go to the professor's house? You think that's really necessary? No, not a tool belt. Those things with the suspenders that are made of leather that you see people wearing when they're moving furniture so they don't throw their back out. I can't imagine you being less helpful right now. You can go. Fine, I'm going. Have fun in there, doing whatever you're gonna do. Do you remember that babysitter we had, when we were like, seven and nine? We had a few, you mean the one that talked like this or the one that would pull our earlobes really creepily seductively. The earlobe one. Why, did she like, molest you or something? I don't think so. I mean I think I would have remembered if I had been molested. Not necessarily. I mean, most children usually repress it until they're much older and in therapy, you know? If I was molested, then you were definitely molested. You've always been a hot commodity in the world of perverts. Thanks. Remember that guy with the handlebar moustache, who worked with dad? Oh yeah, you mean Uncle Randy? Why, what about him? - That guy wasn't our uncle. - What? Yes he was. See, you're a hot commodity in the world of perverts. You know what, that's probably the nicest thing you've ever said to me Colin, thank you. Anyway, my point is, I've been thinking about this woman a lot lately. I feel like, she might have given me my first erection. Is that a weird thing to have remembered now? Oooh, boner appétit. Not really, I'm just surprised it wasn't the one that talked like this that gave you your first erection. That's kind of... she would have been mine. - Do you have a point? - Yeah, I do have a point. My point is you were definitely molested. You just seem like the type. Don't look at my crotch when you say molested. I'm gonna look at your crotch and say that. Molested. Hey, it's me. JR? It's JR, hello? We're like about twenty minutes away. We'll be there in a little bit, okay? I mean, I guess we can wait an hour, but that's kind of annoying. Alright, look. When we get inside I'm probably going to need a minute with my professor alone so if you can just hang out in his... Why are you still calling him your professor? It's not like you're walking into office hours. Just call him your ex-boyfriend at this point. Are you really starting this now? Well, no, I just think it's weird that you still refer to like he's in some position of esteem even though the guy has revealed himself to be nothing but a creep. Okay, fine. Neil. I'll call him Neil. Just, alright, when we get in there, don't say anything, don't do anything, your job is to be silent as a mime. Just hang out in the guestroom and pretend you're invisible, okay? - Oh, son of a bitch. - I, uh, I told you to wait. So what, are you, dating the guy now? The guy out there? - Yeah. - It must be going well. He seems like a really charming, upstanding individual. He's really smart actually. And a great listener. Is that Colin, I guess? I, uh, I see the resemblance. Please, let's not bring him into this. Okay. It seems like maybe you brought him into this, right? You want to talk, I mean, talk. I mean, I don't need to be reminded how much being around you is like babysitting. Yeah, I don't need to be reminded how much hanging out with you feels like I'm in a geriatric facility. Let's not do he said, she said. Okay? I don't want to play that. I'd rather this experience sort of end on a positive note so I can harbor some sort of nostalgia for our situation. Our situation? Is that really what you'd call it? - Really? Can you... - Oh, sorry. Sorry, you can't handle me being on your level, can you? I'd hardly call it a relationship, would you? I thought so, at the time, yeah. Really? I sort of thought of it as like a continuation of our sort of mentor pupil thing we had during the enrollment in our class. Yeah, you're such a great broadcasting professor, by the way. Thanks for getting me all those jobs that you seem to promise me. - Thanks. - No problem. I could tell you needed a strong male figure the minute we met and I'm not going to deny you that. Does your daughter have a strong male figure in her life? We don't talk about my family, remember? Oh yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. Why are we not allowed to talk about your family again? Is that because you're too ashamed to admit what a loser you are when you remove yourself from a room full of students half your age? I'm starting to think we're not going to have that one last conversation I was hoping for. I don't even know what to say. You want to eradicate any kind of, like, hope I would have to maybe, like, go out smiling with this thing we had? I'm not, I'm not being dramatic. It's no big deal, you came in here all amped up. I wasn't expecting to come in here and see you with some random girl that you... - I don't even... - Fair. Well, you will be missed. Yeah, I'll miss you. I'll really miss you. I'll miss your insecurities, no question about that. Sort of suitable for a fourteen, twelve year old, fourteen year old. - Yeah. That two year age difference. - I'll miss that. I'll miss having to hold my breath while we have sex. - I gave you dozens of orgasms. - Dozens of orgasms? I feel like I could use that stupid sex tape we made on your digital camera as like, part of my acting reel. - That's how fake it was. - You have an acting reel? Yeah. You were making that while you were watching reality TV? I don't know anything about that. I do work. It's not like I'm just sitting here. Maybe if you spent more time with me I wouldn't be home watching TV. I cannot believe that I... I have to use the bathroom, and I just, this is retarded. What, are you crying now? You upset? No, I'm not crying. I'm allergic to your stupid cat. Another cliché. I mean, really, like... - Being allergic to cats is a cliché? - Yeah, it's a huge cliché. No, like, girls like you always are allergic to cats. - That's a given. - Girls like you. - Yeah. - What does that even mean? Like, are there any girls who are, like, remotely, like, okay looking who aren't nuts? I mean, do those girls exist? Where are they? As are, like, faking orgasms. Speaking of clichés. Yeah, yeah. That's what it is. Sorry I'm not original like you. What if for once, like, instead of asking daddy to, like, take care of you, you actually learned to take care of yourself? Was that an option? You definitely didn't take care of me. How did you take care of me? I don't know. Did you ever, like, reach for a check when it came? Did that ever happen, even once? You never took me to a restaurant that was over twelve dollars so I don't think I should feel obligated to pay the check. You're a full time professor. No, seriously. Seriously, answer the question, first. Answer that question, and then we'll just go on. - Did you ever reach for a check? - No. I never did. Okay. That's what I'm talking about when I say 'I took care of you.' I have to use the bathroom, excuse me. Bitch. I can't believe I allowed you to, like, have this freaking fantasy that we were dating and like a couple or something. - Its just ridiculous. Can you please... - Yeah, yeah. - What am I making you uncomfortable? - Can you get your things? Oh yeah, like I have so much stuff. It's really taking up so much room in your house. It's like, yeah, it's taking up psychic energy in my house. - Oooh, psychic energy. - Yeah. You have to do an exorcism. Why don't you burn sage when I leave. Why don't you have your blonde whatever burn sage... purge. Anyway, do you want to sit back down? I mean, you're just kind of taking up a lot of space there. Yeah, I'm sorry I'm making you uncomfortable. A little bit. I don't know. When I think back on what we had, all I think about is you, like, wasting time, spending my money, eating my food, etcetera. Fuck you. Look, I don't have to deal with this. - I'm just here to get my stuff. - That's all I think. When I think of you, I think of etcetera. - You're just a huge waste of my time. - You're a huge waste of my time. Did you ever get me any jobs relating to broadcasting? All these things that you promised? Never came to life. Ever. - Everything you've said is true. So... - Thanks. Thanks for validating me. So maybe we could... tie a bow around this thing, and, uh... Fuck you! What the fuck is this thing? Fuck you! Did you hear something? No, I'm fine, I'm happy to leave. This is retarded. I can't believe that you ever... Whoa, whoa. - Oh my god. Colin... - He tripped. Jesus! - Are we about through here? - This is a comedy of errors. Because it's not that I'm not having a fun time, because I am. Well maybe it's a lesson, not to come where you're, like, unwanted. Get away from me, stop it. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Watch out for my vase. You care more about the vase than helping him up? No, you guys maybe should hit the road, I don't know. Don't you think? Fine. We'll leave. We'll leave you here alone, with you girl. And your surprisingly tastefully decorated apartment. It's nice of you to come help your sister. I mean, seeing your apparent reconciliation is intriguing. I don't know. Based on what she said I assumed you two didn't have a very good relationship. Don't listen to him, he's just trying to upset you. Some of the things she would say are just awful. It's not even true. Stop it. Someone should write a case study about you guys. Like you, the victim of circumstance, you the victim of yourself. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, exactly. You don't know because you're a child psychologist. You're a journalism professor. So your case study would be a piece of garbage. Anyway. Your difficulty would come from your overwhelming lack of experience with child psychology and your relative slight experience in journalism and broadcast. - Asshole. - You guys make quite the couple. Like one, barely able to seek and maintain the attention of a male, the other a pathetic wreck of post-graduate stereotyping. What did I do? You seem unaware of how little respect your sister has for you, for starters. Yeah well, you know what? I might not be some cool journalism professor, student, whatever, but I am well aware of how little respect everyone has for me. That was even more fun than I anticipated. What's next on this exciting tour? Abortion clinic? Do you need an abortion? Rape factory? Children' swing of the local leper colony? I've got a better idea. Why don't we go to the local soup kitchen and we can feed the hungry while listening to their sob stories. I think that's probably the next fun thing we can do after what just happened. Alright, I just need a minute. Can you just wait right here? What? No. Can't we just leave now? Colin! Please. Fuck. Excuse me, Ms. Wagner? How is everything? - A bit salty. - Oh, I'm so sorry. May I say that you are our favorite, favorite newswoman, and could you please sign this for me? The whole town would be thrilled if we could hang that for our restaurant. Thank you. Excuse me. Ms Wagner? Hi. Don't be alarmed, I'm not like, a creepy stalker or anything, I just wanted to come over and introduce myself. My name is JR, I too am a news anchor. Or I'm, I should say... I'm a perspiring, uh, an aspiring news anchor, like you. I just wanted to let you know that you are the whole reason I watch WORM every night. You so good on TV. You are amazing. Like, you help me fall asleep at night, but you know, your voice, watching you on TV. Not that you're helping me fall asleep. That's creepy. I just, the reason why I came over here is cause I was just curious if you have any advice for somebody like myself trying to break into the biz. You know, and be on TV. And... anything? You know, off the top of my head: don't interrupt people while they're eating. Okay. Anything else? Ok, well, thank you. I'm taking you off my vision board Ms. Wagner. - It's like, Mexican style brunch. - I know. - JR? - Julia? - Julia. Hey. - Hey. - So nice to see you. - It's nice to see you, sort of. - You look so funky and cool. - Kim? - Hey JR. - Kim. Oh my God, hey. Nice to see you. It's been a long time. How's it going? Good. We just got brunch. It was really good. That's cool. Are you still trying to be, like, a weather girl on television or something? You mean a news anchor? Yeah, yeah, I still do want to be a news anchor. Actually that's why I was in town. I just had a meeting with Ms. Wagner, the broadcaster on TV. I don't know if you know her. She's my hero. And a personal friend. I mean, I think it went well. I don't know. We'll see. Fingers crossed. It's really weird that we're running into you because we were just talking at lunch about how we don't really see people from high school any more. Really? Were you talking about how you ignore people from high school who you used to be best friends with until something happened? I still feel really bad about the way our friendship deteriorated so abruptly. Do you? I know what caused it and so do you. This one! I'm having a party tonight. You should totally come. No, that would be awkward. Why would you want me to come? - I don't know. Erik's going to be there. - Erik who? Kim's cousin is coming and he's an agent. Like a TV agent? Yeah, he's, um, Teddy is an agent in Los Angeles and he's going to be at the party. And, I might be able to hook you with something through him. Really? Like, news, news anchor roles. If I remember to introduce you. Oh my God, yeah, if you could introduce me that would be amazing. I mean, uh, I mean, maybe. I don't know. I mean, I'm here with my brother so I don't know if we'll have time, but... - You're here with Colin? - Yeah. He should totally come. Bring Colin, that would be great. - No, really? - Yeah. Is he still kind of fat? No, no. He is not fat anymore. He went a bunch of, he tried a lot of diets and it finally worked for him. - Is he cute? - I guess. I mean, he's my brother. - I guess... my brother. - Oh my God. Where is he? Colin is back at... shit! I have to go. I'm sorry. I'll see you later. I'm still kind of hungry. I don't want to go to any party. I want to go home. That was my opinion too before I realized that I'm practically homeless so I figured, what's the rush. Besides, you didn't give me a chance to finish. The person who invited us to this horrible party is not other than your childhood crush... - Kim Thompson. - Kim Thompson? Yup. Hottest girl in school. Besides me. Come on. It'll be fun. Why do you even want to go to this party? You've been moving for years to get away from these people. I don't know. I just feel like it'll be cathartic, you know? How? Maybe not cathartic but at least interesting. Those are two completely separate adjectives. No party I've ever been to or heard of has been anything remotely resembling cathartic. You want catharsis, you have a near death experience. Alright, can you just stop saying cathartic? - You said cathartic first! - Alright, just stop. Colin, you're being so annoying. It's my car, it's my rules, and we're buying you a completely new outfit because you cannot go to a party dressed like that. What's wrong with my clothes? What do you mean what's wrong with your clothes? You look a boy that would own a blow up doll. I'm sorry but it's true. Well these clothes are not built for style. They're built for comfort and also for durability. I've been wearing these jeans for years. Exactly. Yeah, that stain indicates as much. - Ooh la la. - Well, so what? I don't even want to go to this stupid party. Just drop me off at a movie or something. - No, please. Kim Thompson. - Okay, fine. But under one condition and one condition only. You're not buying me new clothes, not now not ever. I'm only going to go to this party if I can go wearing my current clothes. Okay. I think that's good enough, right? Colin, just please come out. You've been in there for like, forty five minutes. No way. I feel ridiculous. These pants are so tight. How can any man enjoy this? I have no breathing room. I can feel my sperm count just disappearing every second I'm standing here. "I feel my sperm count disappearing." Just think of these pants as like, stylish birth control or something. I don't even know what the point of this is. There was nothing wrong with my initial pants. Your pants are a nightmare, Colin. That's the whole reason we're here. - Pants are pants! - Pants are not all created equally. Please, just come out. I'm not going to judge you. No. I feel ridiculous. Alright, look. We're on a schedule. I just can't... what are you doing in there? - Why aren't you wearing a shirt? - What are you doing? Stop it. Colin. Can you come here? Please? Okay. Okay. Do you think I should grow my bangs out or leave them the length they are, like, short. I don't care at all. Not even a tiny bit. I promise. I just feel like, I don't know, without these like, funky bangs how are casting directors going to know I'm the type of girl that likes music and art and cultural stuff, you know? No, I don't. That's not actually that bad. This shirt isn't a nightmare. No. The sleeves aren't long enough. I have long arms, I need adequate coverage. - What are you doing? Stop. - No, this is the look. This is how its supposed to look. Now I'm going to get all cold. My wrists are exposed. Do you remember what dad always said, Colin? The person who exposes himself is always the life of the party. This is a win-win situation. - Are you coming? - What? - Are you coming? - No. - My clothes are all dirty. - Oh, are they? Yeah, my favorite pair of pants in the world are filthy now because of you. - You're having fun? - Yeah. - You're proud of yourself? - Yeah. - You're okay with your life? - Yeah, are you? With yours? I'm okay with it. I have a great life. - Yeah? I don't think so. - Oh, look at this dog. - It's so cute. Look. - Is this dog going to bite her? - No. - So cute. There's no chance it's going to bite her? - You excited for this party tonight? - No. What about slutty time with Kim Thompson? What about it? She said that her cousin would be there. He's like an agent. That's a good look for you. This is he best you've ever looked. This is how much I want to go to the party. Oh really? That doesn't make any sense. - Have one. - I don't want one. - Come on. - No. I don't want one. - They're so good. - I don't want to eat anything. - Your shirt, your outfit looks good. - Christ, it still all sugary. What the hell is that thing made out of? Colin, do you know how rare these offensive figurines are? I wish real black people were as rare as this. - Colin, don't say that out loud. - I knew I would love Boston. - Then don't judge them. - I don't judge them. I look at a good looking black, good looking Asian woman the same way I look at a good looking man. What does that mean? I could see how a gay man or a woman would find this guy attractive, but for me, I have nothing. My sexual preference is for white women and I don't expect to be discriminated against. Ooh, sorry. Did you ever find any weird sex stuff growing up? I think I'm going to purchase this bedpan. It seems like it might be useful. Colin, did you just hear what I asked you? I did, but I'm ignoring you so I won't be responding. Now can we please get out of here before you break something? - I'm not going to break any... - Colin! Jesus Christ! - What are we going to do? - Let's just go. - We can't just go. - Why not? The car's right outside. - No, we have to pay for this. - No come on, let's get out of here. - I think we've got a problem here. - Well, she did it. - No I didn't. He broke it. I'm sorry. - You break it, you buy it. Okay. Well, how much, um, how much could it possibly be? - It's five hundred dollars for the vase. - Colin. - No, seriously. - I'm serious. - Do you have five hundred dollars? - Guess I can't get this bedpan now. I can't believe we're actually going to a party with your friends from high school. I can't believe I actually got you to wear those skinny jeans. Yeah great, I feel really cool. Alright, look. Theres a few things we need to go over before we go in, okay? Number one: nobody can know I was living with my professor. Why? Number two: just listen. Number two, if anybody asks the only reason why I'm not on TV yet being a news anchor is because I'm not settling. I'm not settling for local stuff. I'm only holding out for major markets, okay? - What constitutes a major market? - Nobody's going to ask you that. - What if they do? - Oh my God, you just spit in my eye. Look, if somebody said major markets to me, the first thing I would say back to them is, "what constitutes a major market?" So if someone asks me that, I want to be prepared. Alright, fine. New York, Philadelphia, Hollywood, Los Angeles. Hang on, I have to write this down. What are you...you don't need to write this down. It's not a big deal. Well I'm not going to remember otherwise. I didn't know I was going to have to memorize material tonight. - This is really stressful for me. - Boston, Newark. - Delaware or New Jersey? - Delaware. I hardly think that constitutes a major market. It doesn't matter because nobody's going to ask you. Just promise me that once we get inside, you're not going to disappear, leaving me alone with people I don't know all night. I can't handle that right now. Colin, I promise you I will not leave you alone at this party. I'll even pinky swear with you that I won't leave you alone. - That's how honest and genuine I am. - No, I don't pinky swear. You know that. It's a barbaric practice. Well then I can't guarantee that I'm telling the truth. Well then tough shit, I'm going to go home. Wait a minute, is that Harriet Tubman? Gotcha. I'll be right back. So, who invited you? Oh! My bad. - So how's your mom doing? - She's good. You know. She's been a little sick the last couple weeks, but, I think I'm going to have to get out of here in a minute. Oh, really? Oh, that's too bad. I wanted to ask you more about your family. - We haven't caught up in a long time. - Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. - Oh yeah. That's true. - Kim, can you believe I really made it? Oh, yeah, hi. Well, my cousin actually just had to leave for Los Angeles. I'm really sorry. Oh, I completely forgot about that. Um, it's all good. I mean, my manager probably wouldn't want me meeting with random agents anyway. You know, he'd want a commission through your cousin or whatever. What kind of roles are you looking for? Oh, I don't know. I mean, I'll, I can do all sort of stuff. I have the diversity of a young Robert Redford. Well, if you see your cousin again I guess just give him my resume. It will probably tell him, you know, my range. So, thanks. Looks like you had a little accident there. Oh, yeah. This. Some gentleman spilled some red wine on me earlier. It was, it wasn't on purpose. You know. Just one of those things that happens. Would you like a slice of pineapple? No thanks. Yeah, who's the idiot who brought that, anyway? Oh. Yeah, boy what an idiot would bring this. Actually, you know, pineapple is a sign of hospitality. So maybe it's not such an idiot who brought this after all. Perhaps the person who provided this just wanted everyone at the party to have a nice nutritious snack. You know, I've heard that pineapple, actually, if you eat a lot of it, it reduces swelling if you get your wisdom teeth taken out. Well, I still have mine so I'll keep that in mind, thank you. Well, I've also heard that if a man eats a lot of pineapple it will make his ejaculate taste delicious. - Why are you telling me this? - I don't know. I figured maybe I could eat this entire thing and we could all see what happens. - I going to go now. - Okay, that's great. I'm just going to stay here and cut this pineapple up and eat it a little bit myself. You know, broadcasting is just such a hard thing to break into. It's like, these people get these on camera jobs and they don't ever want to leave. It's like they hold on for dear life. Even if there's people out there who are way more talented. You know? But, it'll happen eventually. I mean, me and my manager are setting up jobs in major markets. - Nothing local. - What are major markets? Oh, hey bro. I forgot to mention. There's a dress code for men. Yeah, men have to wear jackets. I got this one special for you. Put it on. Now. I insist. Good evening. I'm your nightly correspondent JR. In other news, multiple school children were found bludgeoned to deaf, bludgeoned to death. Wait, let me start over. Okay. Good evening. In other news, multiple school children were found bludgeoned to death, their bodies stuffed in a garbage disposer. Garbage chute. Garbage shoot. This always happens in auditions. Whatever, it's way harder than it looks on TV. You know that. Where are you going? - How is that? - It's really good. - Can we go home now? - Why? We just got here. I'm having a horrible time. Somebody spilled drink on me on purpose. You don't even notice. None of the girls want to eat any of my pineapple. Oh, you owe me for that pineapple by the way. I don't understand why we're still talking about this. Who's your friend? No, no. This is my brother Colin. You remember. - Colin? - Hi Kim. - I didn't even recognize you. - You've known me since I was six. Yeah, but you used to be so... I mean, you look so different now. Do I? I didn't used to have all this drink spilled on me. That must be it. You know, Colin used to have the biggest crushes on you guys growing up. I don't know if you knew that. - What the fuck? - Yeah, it's true. Do you remember in tenth grade when we took those photos in our bathing suits? He saved all of them. Even the ones of me. - Isn't that kind of weird? - I don't mind. Yeah, Colin, we're flattered. Yeah, well, uh, JR didn't know how to read until she was ten. Isn't that hilarious? I had to teach her and I'm younger. That's not true. You're so funny Colin. I mean, I am but it's not as funny as you not knowing how to read until you were in fourth grade. Excuse me. I should probably go call my manager and see if any casting people called me. - Excuse me. - Hi. I'm Colin. You know, it's just hard. Because you still want to go out, you know? I mean, I'm only twenty six but I have a husband and a kid. Oh, you got married and had a kid already? Well of course I did. I mean how else do you think I get to be here tonight? Let me tell you, the only thing better than having a live in babysitter is having a husband in a back brace. Ooh la la, sounds romantic. Can I talk to you? This is way less fun than I thought it was going to be. Hey, do you think I have a shot at Kim tonight? I think things are going well with us. Oh my god, yes. Totally. That's the only thing good in the party. I feel like Kim is giving you really slutty eyes. I feel like you should go for it. I know, it's surprising. I didn't bring my A-game, I didn't prepare any jokes, nothing, but here she is, giving everything to me. Now JR, you are very bohemian, to me. Is that the word I'm looking for? It is. So you choose to express yourself in a very different way and I respect that. I'm just wondering, how you can get a job looking the way that you do. I mean, what's your secret? But you know it's more than just gainful employment. It's about finding a job that matters. Always working towards being the best in your field. - Making good career choices. - Good career choices. Like what? Well, I'm a junior accountant at one of the biggest telecommunication firms in the city. Pretty soon, that's going to be senior accountant. I am assistant to the head of client management at an artist's union. - I work for a temp agency. - Oh my God. I tempted before. It's so boring. I was entering data like, for two weeks straight. I felt like a robot. I totally know what that's like. No, no. I'm not a temp. That's sort of ridiculous. I work for the temp agency. I place people in positions. JR, how do you have time for all your little auditions? I mean, do you do them after work, or do you have a flexible job? I can't imagine what kind of job you have, you have such a kooky sense of humor. No, no. Let's keep talking about you. I'm just a fly on the wall at this party. JR, don't be so modest. Even if it is just a day job, it's still a really big part of your life. Uh, no. It's not like you're just sitting around doing nothing, waiting for a phone call asking you to be a weather girl like you were in high school. No, that would be weird and pathetic, right? - Yeah. So what is it? - No, no. - No what? - No... nurse. I am a nurse. Well there you go. For a minute there, we thought you didn't do anything. How silly would that be? That would be sickening. See that's nurse talk. Sick. It's just such a beautiful, noble profession. God bless you, JR. God bless you and the American Nursing Association. No, no. That's okay. No, no, that's fine. Look, you've got a choice to make, buddy. You can go on and get out of here, and we can wait for that girl I hear is your hot sister to get drunk enough so we could audition her ourselves. That is tempting. But, what's my other choice? Or you could take your gauche ass out of here and replenish our supplies? Supplies? What, like cleaning supplies? - What do you need? - Party supplies, asshole. We need cups and shit. Store's down the street. It's your choice. Or we can just drag your under dressed ass out of here and beat the shit out of you. - Hey. - Hey. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about all of that. Oh, whatever. It's okay. I just, I didn't realize you were a nurse. Had I known, I never would have put you on the spot like that. Whatever. It's fine. You and that guy just seemed so uncomfortable. You mean my brother? Brother? Huh. Anyway, I just want you to know that I have great respect for everyone in the medical profession. - Why is that? - Because of my crippling polio. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... - I can't feel that. I didn't mean to... sorry. Okay. - Hi. - Hey. Are you guys really only here for one night? Oh yeah, I mean, I'm just here to help Colin move his stuff out of his girlfriend's house. They just broke up. So, that's kind of why I took him out to this party. - Because he's so down in the dumps. - That's really sweet of you. I don't think I would ever do that for my brother. Yeah, neither would I. Supplies! Colin! Oh my God, are you okay? You guys are such assholes! Thank God we have a nurse on the premises. Alright. Just take your time. Slow, slow. Easy, easy. Alright. Just stay right there. I'll be right back. Oh my God. I can't believe that just happened. Should I disrobe for the remainder of my physical? Yeah, sure. Let nurse JR go and get you a paper robe. Colin, I am so sorry about this trip. This has been a nightmare. Thanks. It's no problem. I'm having a great time. It's definitely not as cathartic as I thought it was going to be. - I think it's pretty nice. - Yeah, right. - Am I interrupting something? - No. I'll be right back. - Hey. I got that for you. - Oh, thanks. This is just what I need. I've wanted to do that since I was eleven. I've been wanting to do it since you walked in the door this evening. - What's going on in here? - Nothing. We were just making out. But we're finished now. I'm gonna to go. Thanks, Kim, my brother really needed that. Fuck you. And your stupid weather girl career. We were only ever friends with you because your family had a trampoline. I'm sorry. Fuck you. Fuck you. Is what I mean. Fuck you. I'm going to go throw up before we leave. Let's just keep this between us, alright? That was really cathartic, actually. Thanks for including me in this fun, fun party. Thank... whoops... thank. Now? No, you are so drunk, Colin. We're not driving all the way home. I don't want to spend another night in a hotel. No more anywhere, I just want to go home, get in my own bed. Let's just go to grandma an grandpa's cabin. It's like, so close. What? That's like twelve hours away from here. It's less than an hour. I used to make the drive with Neil all the time. - What? No. Really? - It's really not that far. Tell you what. I'll go to the cabin but you go get the car, I'm just going to lay down here on the sidewalk and take a nice little nap. Oh, that sounds like a good plan. Colin, what the hell is this? Looks like something from Aunt Connie's funeral. What? Aunt Connie is dead? What are you talking about? - Yeah, Aunt Connie died. - I just saw her ten months ago. - Yeah, she died, like, six months ago. - Why didn't anybody tell me? I think mom and dad kind of decided not to invite you because they thought you'd be a little bit of a downer at the funeral. I'd be a downer at a funeral? Isn't that kind of harsh? Well, I don't know. Just the whole unemployment, professor thing. You just kind of weren't invited. But it was a lovely service. Oh. I'm sure. You really think I would have been that much of a downer at a funeral? Well it wasn't my decision. I'm sleeping over there. Goodnight. Come in. Colin we're the only ones here. - You don't have to knock. - Sorry. - It's okay. What's up? - Can I put something to you? - What do you mean put something to me? - Ask you something? Why don't you just say can I ask you something? - I don't know, what does it matter? - Alright. What is it? - No. I don't want to say it. - Colin, what? What is it? Okay. Tonight at the party, did I seem at all, like any of those people? No. Not really. I just feel like, I don't know, the way you looked at them. I just saw so much hatred. I would never feel comfortable with anyone looking at me like that. I mean, you annoy me but I could never look at you like that. - Those people are losers. - Yeah. I guess. I just feel like there's so much pressure put on having an interesting or exciting and unpredictable life. I thought so to, but I'm kind of realizing having an unpredictable life is sort of overrated. Oh yeah? I don't know, I mean, just the way you've talked to me and what you said about, you know, people with these pathetic jobs. I don't know, I would never want you to look at me like that. I could never look at you like that. Those people are fails. - We're special. They're like normal. - Yeah. Wait, but you wanted to make out with Kim, right? Yeah. I mean, I had to. I owed it to myself. My younger self. I guess. I wonder what she's doing now. Do you think she hates us? - I don't know. Probably. - It's weird. I wonder if she's like, asleep. Isn't it weird that everyone goes to sleep at night. Like, everyone is in bed, sleeping. There's not one person that doesn't sleep. Except sharks. I guess Zoe's probably asleep now. Oh, yeah. What about Zoe? You two are like, together for serious, right? Yeah, what about her. I don't know. I don't know. Are you going to tell her what happened? No. I mean, I couldn't. The situation with her is so fucked. - We haven't actually... - In what way? I mean, we haven't actually had any sex for, like, weeks or months. Wait, mom and dad didn't take you to Puerto Rico? No, we went to Puerto Rico. I lied about how romantic it was. I'm sure, you know, the way things are going I'm going to be on the suburban marriage wagon any day now. With male pattern baldness and varicose veins. It's a relief to hear that you didn't... That I didn't what? I don't know. It's just like, I was thinking about her but, I guess that's pretty much it. I don't know. You're not going to end up like a normal suburban loser. Like those people. I'll come whisk you and your stupid, or precious gargoyles away before I'll ever let that happen. I see you like, twice a year. I'd be completely a lost cause before you ever got to me. No. Just call me and I'll pull you, I'll whisk you away to whoever my new mentor or suitor is. You can live in their basement or something. It's way too late for me. I'm trapped and I floated away to sea. No! No, you're okay. Honestly, I mean, what would you rather be doing if you weren't having your current life? What, you mean like a Plan A? Yeah. What's your Plan A? What's your dream life? I don't know. I guess at some point I thought maybe I could teach. Teaching? That's ironic. You were always the one to say that teaching is like the biggest failure. That, there's nothing worse than teaching. That teaching is allowing others to fail. While spinning your own wheels. You really remember exactly what I said. Well, yeah. It had an effect. At one point I maybe thought I would pursue teaching and you talked me out of it. You? Teach? You're not qualified to teach. You're barely qualified to learn. - Thanks, I guess. - I don't know. I mean, it just felt like something that I could do. It's something that I don't have to struggle at. It just seemed like an option. But then what? You teach for ten years and then what? What are you going to do then? I guess you can just fuck your young students and promise them jobs. Shut up. I'm sorry. I'm in no position to judge. I guess I could imagine you, though. What? Fucking my students? - Yeah. - Or teaching. Or fucking my students? - Yeah. Having sex with your students. - Thanks. They way you were with Kim tonight, I can just imagine all the creepy perverse stuff you're capable of that I didn't think before. Oh, yeah? Well, you don't know the half of it. Ooh la la. I don't even want to know. Oh, remember what I was saying earlier about mom's vibrator? Or I started to tell you and then you cut me off at the store? Yes, I've been unable to get an erection because of it. It's haunted me every second since you told me. Wait, Kim didn't give you a boner? Um, sorry I was just thinking if there's a way I could kill myself before you go on with this. Don't you want to hear a story about mom's vibrator? Isn't that what every, every young man wants to hear about? Well since I guess I can't actually kill myself before you keep talking, you might as well just go on. Okay. Well don't tell anyone but when I found it, I don't know why, but I felt like I should smell it. Isn't that disgusting? I just though, I don't know when the last time she used it, or what or if it was just a family heirloom or something. But, I just wanted to know what it smelled like. Yeah? And? It didn't smell like anything. So, nothing at all. Maybe that means if you ever have children, mom passed on the no smell private part to your offspring. Congratulations, your daughter will be a big hit at parties. I know. Don't tell me that a scent free vagina is a great thing like I don't already know that. Is there any other scene related family information that you want to pass on to me? Did you ever smell any, any underpants around the house? Ooh la la, no. Is there any ass information you can divulge to me? - Alright, stop. - Sorry, I'll stop. I'll stop, stop with all the butt cracks. Ha ha. No, that actually was funny. So stupid. I can just imagine you though. Being a teacher. You'd be, I can just imagine you in front of some class. You wearing your stupid marshmallow shoes and your stupid jeans and some weird off the rack blazer, being like, "come on class, listen to me. Come, you know, I'm a serious professor, look at me, look at my gargoyles." You really got me down pat there. What else is there? That's it. That's all you say to the class and you walk out. No, I can just imagine it though. You gathering your stuff after class. Everyone leaves and you're such an awkward guy and the class has like, never had a teacher like you before. And they don't know what to make of you. And I'm sure there is some random girl at the end of class. She's like, packing up her books really slowly as everybody leaves. And you're like, putting your books in your satchel or whatever professors carry. She walks over to you and asks for a minute of your time. She's wearing some sort of old fashioned angora sweater and pleated shorts, or something like from the movies. And like, I can just see it. She's like, 'professor, can I talk to you, can I talk to you?' And you're like, you appreciate her because she's the only one in the class who laughs at your stupid jokes. And nobody knows but she's wearing a pin that you gave to her. Because one day you were wearing it and she said she liked it, and weeks later you just had one for her when you gave her back her notes. I can just imagine, casually, you go to the movies. And you leave a seat empty, hoping that somebody will sit there. And nobody does, but then right as the movie starts, right as the movie starts, she walks in. She walks down the aisle and takes the seat where you put your stupid blazer. She sits down. I can just imagine that maybe that night you held each other's hand while you shared popcorn. Even though she doesn't like butter, so you didn't even put butter on it, just to be nice. And then you don't talk again until later. After the movie, another time at office hours. You give her back her rough draft with notes in it. And scribbled on page four is an address. Your address obviously. She's not a minute late, and right as you open the door, she's there. She looks so ready, and fun, and like a good person. She'll be a success and you guys get each other. Which is so rare. And it just, I don't know. It just makes sense. That's what it'd be like if you were a professor, I think. - Sounds like your kind of guy. - I guess he is. - Colin? - Yeah? Can you call me Jeanette right now? Please. No one's called you Jeanette since you were eleven. - Just do it. - Ok, Jeanette. - Goodnight, Colin. - Goodnight, Jeanette. - Is that it? - That's it.

Good luck.
