Hey Siri! Send message to Nadine. What should the message be? I'm still paddling here. I'll get home around one o'clock. I'll drive right over to you. You can wait for me naked in the pavilion. Then I'll eat your skin and hair. Shit! - Wait. - Your message is: "I'm still paddling here, guess until around one." I can't find any Nadine in your contacts. Say who you want to send the message to. Before the story I'm about to tell you, nothing has ever happened here in La Pointe . No one has ever made it anywhere here . We had no writers or singers here, not even a rugby player. In other words: Anything to do here was to sit with your ass in the sand and watch the waves.. And guess what? That was great for all of us. Everyone except Maja Bordenave, First Sergeant at La Pointe Marine Corps. For 27 years she mainly pulled cats from trees, like you know it from American films. But this morning, in the middle of a heat wave, finally something happened. Now look at these hollow skulls! Hello! There you are at last. Something to drink? Breakdown? Bread? Baguette? Do you have bread? No, I wanted to know if your engine has broken down? Something hit the boat. No, nothing hit the boat, the boat hit something. Sandbar here, boating prohibited here. It says big on the sign. French, English, German. - I didn't see it. - Forget it. I will have a look. We saw a shark. - You saw that too, didn't you? - Yes, I saw that too. - We both saw him. - I only understand Spanish. Maja to Ruben. I am here on site, mission accomplished. Returning to base. - What was that about? - Guess! "Something hit the boat." More tourists who can't read? The ninth time in two weeks. What did I tell you? You owe me ten euros. Old cutthroat! Well, hurry up then! The fries are getting cold. OK, I'll go full throttle! Four meters? It can also be five. You want to tell me there's a shark over four meters out in front of La Pointe? And we should take care of it. I don't send men to hunt sharks because of the hearsay. Impossible. Block off the beaches, Ruben! I know Maja, you will retire soon and you see things. But here in the Gironde there are at most a few dogfish. You touched a sandbar. You are about to retire. But you're not a superhero. We're La Pointe, not Chicago. You have a great husband. I can already see you and Thierry lounging by the pool while we're still slaving away here. Here is my tip for your last week: take it easy At the age of 22 Maja Bordenave had decided to wear the uniform she hasn't off since. She is even said to have worn it at her wedding . Her husband Thierry has held her hand throughout her career. If she was on duty on National Day, he recorded the parade on channel 2 for them. And if she had to go to an emergency at Christmas, he later reheated the turkey. I have to do something immediately. Otherwise there will be a catastrophe here. Do you know what I'm thinking? Your colleagues are idiots. Don't worry about me, it's just a big fish. But Thierry was worried. Maja? Yes I come. Maja had put it off for a long time. Now she finally signed. In three days she would retire. Understood? So I'm going now! 93.2 FM. You are listening to Radio La Pointe and we continue with our summer hit "La Kiffance". Grandma Bordenave, please come. Watch out Ruben! Grandma can still spank you. If you say so, Corps First Sergeant. Joking aside, anything new about the missing person? NNo sorry. There will be fajitas for lunch anyway. Wonderful. You're listening to Radio La Pointe, it's 10:15 am, so it's time for... - Bernard. - And Bernard. - Good morning, Bernard. - Good morning, Bernard. 38 degrees this morning in La Pointe. Oh I can hear them already, the people screaming climate change the collapsologists of all kinds, the scaremongers, the joy killers with greasy hair and vegan leather sandals. But whether the Gretas like it or not: In La Pointe, that beautiful sun is what keeps things going. So no hysteria, dear green friends. Better sit on our beach instead of sticking to the streets. Hello, Dominique. I think you can help me I am looking for two German tourists. Haven't you retired? - Do you know anything about them? - The whole square is full of Germans! A bald guy with big ears and a small poisonous dwarf with an unnaturally red skull. Their boat broke down yesterday. Yes, they damaged the hull. They left this morning. Oh crap. Can I see this boat? Michel, can you take over? Coming very soon. I kept the deposit of 500 euros, but it costs 1000 euros to repair it. They're ruining me, really now. You are welcome. Listen to this. From the science journal: After the Asian hornets and the tiger mosquitoes now come the epsilon hornets. They're everywhere! direct hit! Biscarrosse, Andernos... Even here in La Pointe! I knew it. Like ass on a bucket. What do you mean? Ruben thought I hit a sandbar and I told the same nonsense to the two Germans. No, it was there, 100%. And they both saw it. Three days until retirement, but you still have to go hunting. Those assholes... You assholes! She is filming "Jaws 33"! "The Killer of La Pointe." At your age, it's important to drink when it's this hot. How funny Blaise. Very quirky. I thought the three of us were a team. It's no fun getting soaked when you're on duty. - But that's... - Maja! Go out to the aqua park! Alright, we've got things to do folks, come on! - Something stinks here! - Don't get excited, bear. You will have another heart attack. Sébastien, I'm talking to the police. - It smells strange. - It stinks. I'm no expert, but I'd say it's shit. Why don't you call a plumber? I've looked everywhere. It is not the drain, the kitchen or the toilet. I even took a PCR test yesterday just in case I had Covid and it was in my nose. Mamouch. - And? - Negative. I have another suspicion. The Parisians. The Parisians? The Parisians from Aubervilliers, exactly. The youngsters. Do the Parisians stink? I can almost see them in front of me. I guess last night two or three of them snuck out Got some buckets of shit from the shelter or something and made fun of smearing some of it everywhere. For example between the engines. - And what good does that do them? - What do I know? Maybe they're just bored because it was fun, or to piss me off. -Sit down. -Shut up! Every year they come here from the suburbs of Paris. It creates chaos and you cannot stop them. They're just rioting here! They think they are someone else, even though they can hardly read or write. They say chocolate bread and not chocolate croissant. What to expect? They do what they want! Okay, but calm down. That's a bit of an exaggeration. Vacationing Parisians are generally well-mannered. But they are like a raft, there are always some rotten planks. We don't want to clean up their shit! - These are young people. - I was young once too. When we were little and misbehaved, we got spanked. But that was in the past, when people still had respect! Yes, there was still respect. The cans on the beach and all the dirt, disgusting! We're not here to be bothered! Here's what! What's going on now? Did you see a ghost? Is it the missing person? I can bet my life on it. So, let's take a closer look. Not pretty, right? If you look closely there, all along the wound then you see something like small marks. - This one? - Yes. Do you see the little lines? And the whole edge is quite irregular. Wait, I'll show you something else! I prepared this before. A sardine. I didn't expect that. Let me explain. French sardines have 53 vertebrae. But the further south you go, the more there are. In Marseille they have 53, in Morocco there is already one more. This one was caught in La Pointe and it has 59 vertebrae. It is unusual to find sardines with 59 vertebrae here. Whatever animal caused these types of injuries, it must have a jaw with a diameter of at least 1.20 m. You can imagine the rest. Yes I can. The fish are migrating, from deep south all the way up to us. due to rising temperatures and climate change. What you and the Germans rammed wasn't a sandbar. - That was more like a big fish. - Like a shark? I didn't dare say it, but yes. Shark, get lost, this is our beach! Leave our waves alone! Idiots! There are the sharks here! Mamouche, sit down or you'll have another heart attack. I'm fine, Sébastien. Take it easy. Sit down, please! Has at least one here seen this shark? No The press hasn't heard anything yet, but... We understand that, Monsieur Fourcade. So we hear Madame Bordenave, thank you. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, I am the first sergeant of the La Pointe Marine Corps. According to the expertise of our coroner, it is official that we are dealing with a shark. You're kidding, I think you've watched too many action movies! Mamouche! Listen, Maja, you know me, I've been fishing here for forty years. And you only see a dogfish or blue shark in La Pointe. I know it sounds incredible, but it's still possible. 40 years ago nobody would have believed in Asian hornets either, and today one heat record is chasing the next. They have to close the beaches, Mayor. Close the beaches? Never! Well, you are retiring, Madame Bordenave, But I still have work to do on the damn beach. And I'm not alone. And you, Mayor? Don't you say anything? They come from the capital and walk around with the stick up their asses! - Mamouche, please. - Let me be! Only until the investigation is over. If a child loses a leg tomorrow, we at city hall will be blamed. Please, ladies and gentlemen! This is a challenge for all of us together. And we don't like that any more than you do. But the La Pointe police will handle this one, too. I can assure you that we will put things in order as soon as possible, and return to normality. For that you have to trust us. We have asked some fishermen from Réunion for help. That's it, I've had enough! Let's go, Sébastien! We'll get the accordion and castanets and then we go begging on the street. Close the beach first. - Understood. - That's it Why do we have to trudge through the sand like idiots here? The fishermen from Réunion only come on Saturday. Until then we will secure the site. Can't we secure this while sitting? Sorry, Blaise. But we have to go a little further. Sir! Sir! Swimming is prohibited! Sir! I have to ask you to come out of the water. Hey, grandpa, are you deaf? Are you color blind? The beaches are closed. By order of the mayor. I have been swimming here for many years. If it's not one thing, it's the other. Last year the fucking corona virus, this year it's your shark. I'm already wondering what's next? - Martians? Giant squid? - Listen, monsieur! If you continue with that tone, you will be fined 135 euros. I won't tell you again. You can't do anything anymore. Don't even smoke in a restaurant. Boring shit. Is that clear, monsieur, I don't want to see you here anymore! Sure! - Enjoy your day! Some people are rude. - Some are idiots. - Or anarchists. Don't let anyone help me here! Oh shit! Ruben! I've thought about it. There's no way I can get going until everyone's safe. Please, Maja, the fishermen will take care of that. The planning is complete. This is my case, Ruben. Yes, that may be so. But your file says you paid all dues and that all references have been acknowledged. Form number 58617. It's your signature, isn't it? Let go. Take it easy. Some people would kill their parents to retire at fifty. 49. This is the last time. Then you're really rid of me. I will play bridge, go on bus trips and wear a thong. And if you want, I'll take coffee trips and buy blankets. But first let me finish this! We've already hung the balloons. I'll give you a week, not a day longer. - Then you drop the case. - Thanks very much. Hey guys! Listen up folks! Pack the bubbly again! I'm going to catch a shark! - Monsieur Bordenave for 9 o'clock? - Back there. I swear I'm innocent, Commissioner. Beautiful evening. I'm sorry I didn't have time to change. I don't smell any champagne. I'm guessing your farewell party was long and sober. Maybe a bit chewy on the back, and no alcohol. I'm glad you waited. Tonight we're taking a cab. So then... How does it feel? I hope there was a nice speech, with hymns of praise and so on. Well then, to you! Honey, I have something to tell you. Okay! I won't stop. Will you do something? I'm not quitting yet. I will catch this shark. Why are you doing this? Isn't there anyone else in your department? I asked for it. you asked for it This can take a few days at most. Do you understand that? I am not sure. Next time we'll drink ourselves. I promise. Okay... for the shark, then. You're listening to Radio La Pointe, it's a quarter past ten, so it's time for... - Bernard... - ...and Bernhard. - Good morning, Bernhard! - Good morning, Bernard! - A giant shark in La Pointe! - That can not be true. I can already hear the so-called experts who tell us in a panic that the probability of truth of this message is 1:100,000. Don't be so hesitant, get dressed! That's okay. Perfect. Excellent. You know what, Eugenie? A fisherman needs a rod and a good chair. Help me. We can throw in the probe and it can tell us what's going on. Different depths, rocks and fish. The information appears on the screen here. We weren't taught that at the police academy. They still use Windows XP. Just look! Do you see all the dots here? All small fish. Mackerel, gobies, sea mullet, perch... As soon as a big fish appears, it will appear on the screen. Well, and then it's our turn. Refill! Here below. See? Like Blaise in the canteen. If someone calls "Food", he is there immediately I hear what you're saying. do you like being with us Well, yes. Basically, I'm doing pretty well there. Don't let the boys take the butter off your bread, okay? And you? You like it so much in the police you don't want to leave, huh? Yes, I'm coming. But we can still meet. Without a uniform? - There's something. Get me back in! - Quick, the lifebuoy! - Do something, Maja! Hurry up! For God's sake, bring me in! - Great, thank you, Eugenie! - I'm sorry, Blaise! Swim! When I'm strapped into a chair? It is here, I can feel it! Swim! do it! - Hurry, Blaise! - It's good! Go ahead! Pull me in! Faster! Come on! That was close! It broke my fishing rod. It's completely screwed. I'll break his neck! Where's the motherfucker? Show yourself, motherfucker! Where! Eugenie, that's just a buoy. Oh, sorry, I have lost my glasses. Over there! - Where exactly? - There! Quick, Maja! Fast! - Quick, Maja! - Here! Go shoot! Pull the trigger I think we don't need any more fishermen. In the 40 years that I've been fishing here now, nothing like that ever happened. That's really incredible. Are you sure you wouldn't have been better off killing the fish? Sir, it's 2022. - Mamouche, sit down! - Shit, Sébastien! Do you have to constantly embarrass me in front of everyone? That much sedative could have put forty cows to sleep. After the analysis in about three days, he is flown out and released again somewhere in the Indian Ocean. He's not coming back anytime soon. Madame Bordenave is right. If we kill a protected species, people want to go straight to the Green Party. And it falls back on the city again. Well, that was a successful effort. I hope your cage is safe too, Madame Bordenave. Indestructible, Mr. Mayor. He's sleeping, Sébastien, don't worry. Now let's forget the carbon footprint. The further away, the better. So... Clearly resolved, Maja. But now get ready! they are all waiting for you Sergeant Bordenave, bravo! Thanks, group leader! Thank you all! Thanks. Bravo Maja, we will miss you. Cheers to your shark! And your retirement. Maja did what she promised. She caught the shark in two days. She cried when she returned her uniform. A friend told me. But whatever, it was a dignified farewell. Thierry even put on a shirt. He vacuumed the car and brought tissues with him. Just in case. Together they set out on a new life. A life one always dreams of in La Pointe: A life with your ass in the sand and a view of the sea. - Have a nice day, ma'am. - Same to you. Popsicle! - Maja? - Thanks. - Hey, you're a star! - Do you think so? That it doesn't go to your head. Here's your ice cream. Thanks. - The snowman is for you too. - Thanks. This time even went on the house. You're joking, right? He's usually so stingy. He recognized me. I think he was very happy. They'll replace the Charles de Gaulle statue at City Hall with yours. C'mon stop. Popsicle! Ice... on a stick! Anyway, it seemed like he was gone. - It's a thing. And where was he? - Just go away. And then he was in the little cave after all. Don't, Léonard, that's gross. What happened? Everyone out, go, out! Shit! Everyone out of the water! Fast! That's a bulldog shark, one of the most aggressive shark species out there. Its distinctive feature is an extremely strong jaw. A machine to crush and kill! Whether fish or human makes no difference to him. Protected species or not, You don't catch a killer shark, you kill it! Please, please! We'll start over again. Monsieur Ferrère and his men take over the operation and we rely on his expertise. And if we have to kill the shark, we kill it. Monsieur Ferrère, gentlemen, La Pointe is counting on you! When you retire then you don't go on a shark safari, Madame Bordenave. - Come on, Mamouche! Sit down again! - Leave me alone, Sebastien! "Murderer!" "Murderess" probably didn't fit on it. A wild animal is caught and released again. What else could I have done? People are always looking for someone to blame. You did your best, you always do Here, take him. Take him! Flatten him Really good, isn't it? Now you're thinking of something else. Or? Thousands of ideas to give away Radio La Pointe. And on we go with our new summer hit, directly from La Réunion. We could do the next round now. - Why, we've already done five? - Actually? If you think so, we can also do another round. Would be better. - According to me. Right now? - If it is possible. - Well then, let's go. - Excellent. Let's go! It's best to take a lunch break now. We will be back. Good, then see you soon. are we going too Maja BORDENAVE CATCHES THE SHARK AND FREES LA POINTE! - Good morning, Bernhard. - Good morning, Bernard. Jaws Part 2 wasn't the last chapter, Bernhard. Word has already got around: the shark is back. Maja Bordenave's refusal to kill the animal, made him want to come back. Balance sheet: one dead. Look out Bernard, I can feel the anger rising in you! Just don't say the wrong thing now, otherwise you'll get "woke" problems. but not the Asian wok with soy sauce and rice, but before the shitstorm of woken do-gooders! You're absolutely right, Bernhard, so I'll leave it to the citizens... And please! - Thank you very much. - And your receipt. You never stop, do you? Never. You're better off leaving that to the experts. And you better mind your shit. It was just advice. That annoys some. MOTION DETECTED 25 Kilometer. I'm floored After eight, Caco left us behind, then she was done. Pilou then drove her home. And with you? - How was your day? - Good. I slept like a rock all day. you are all wet... Because it's so muggy. You sweat all by yourself. It will probably be. TWO WANT THE SHAME OF LA POINTE "Cop Wannabe." OUR FATHER IS DEAD AND Maja BORDENAVE KILLED HIM. JUSTICE FOR JEAN-PAUL MURDERER! SLUT! Maja! What was going on? I was all alone tonight Did you sleep in the office? I just couldn't sleep. Walking with the neighbors at three, do you want to go? No, I'd rather lie down again. Fine, but I'll go with you. And stop tweeting. Walking on the beaches and boating are strictly prohibited by prefectural decree! Stepping on the beaches and boating are strictly prohibited by prefectural decree! MOTION DETECTED MURDERER You killed our father. Murderess! And it's night time in La Pointe. People sleep, but fear remains awake. At all? Or only with Maja Bordenave, driven by her paranoid shark madness, who have long since retired, and with the stair lift should drive up the steps of her house. She should hardly sleep peacefully given the deaths she caused. Thierry... Thierry! Stop the lies now! And with the shark too. We're staying at home, so for now. Until you recover. Then we will calmly consider how to proceed. La Pointe went down the drain. Sadness at the loss of life had given way to anger. But that's one thing with anger. It is laden with the blood shed by the victims. And it seeps in like poison. A poison that contaminates everything: the shark opponents, the shark advocates, those who want to surf, those who don't want to surf, and those who shudder at the sight of the sea. And in the end you don't even know who or what you're actually fighting. Thierry and Maja had decided not to stay. There was a guard at the entrance to the campsite. They had a fixed trailer overlooking the harbour, covered terrace and double glazing. And at worst she wanted to go shopping keep her glasses and hat on in the proxy. You were safe. Everything would be fine. Look. Huge, huh? Do you see? That's where the boats and our boat are parked. ...like in La Pointe. Riots broke out in the city center which have meanwhile claimed three lives and thirty serious injuries. The population is extremely unsettled because of the shark, who is still untraceable as did the deserted Maja Bordenave, who was tasked with catching the shark. The situation seems clear to many: The former police officer apparently wants to avoid responsibility. Angry residents have therefore already started looking for her, to make them pay for their cowardice . Thanks very much. Dominique, what happened? Come on, people! Faster, up, up, up! I'm trying to put everything in order. It's pretty awful, I mean, you don't see that very often. So, there was a sound in the water. At first I thought it was kids from Albertville who were rampaging here. And then I just said to him: "Look, you better call the police." And now he's lying there, dead. Maj. Mamouch... Maj. You'll get yourself killed in the process. I'm just worried. What should I do if you go chasing the shark? Lay down and relax? Thierry Bordenave treats himself to a nightcap and get into bed in peace, while his retired wife once again plays the heroine and risks her life. No my Darling. Does not work like that. If I lose you, I lose everything. That's what makes you and me different. So now I have everyone against me. The ones on the street, my colleagues and my husband. Maja Bordenave, the incarnation of wisdom against idiots. The savior of the animal world against the angry people. Since when are you such an eco? You've been driving diesel for 20 years. You get KitKat and Kinder Country. You never buy any organic stuff. Is too expensive for you. That's sheer pride. It has to be Maja Bordenave who catches the shark! I should forbid you, ha? - Thierry, please let me! - Not this time, Maja. Not this time. We're not 80, we're only 50. We're not dead yet. do you want to watch tv There is the mouth of the Gironde, part of the Charente-Maritime, the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel... We're going to need a bigger boat. Big Tasty. Maxi Menu. - Fries and Coke. - And for dessert, McFlurry Daim. Okay, now we're driving. - And the arrows! - Oh fuck! He dived again. Be ready! I don't see him. -Are you okay? -Yes. Eugenie? - Eugenie? - I am here! Maja! Blaise, here I am! House, Blaise! I can't do it! Over there! I can't do it! Blaise! I got him! Blaise! Make it faster! I got him! - Hurry up! - I have him! Blaise... Blaise? Blaise? Blaise? - Blaise! - Blaise! Blaise! Blaise? Blaise! Maja! To the dead! Maja got what she wanted. Her honor was restored. - All the best, Maja. - You too, Ruben. It could have stayed that way. Hello, this is Thierry Bordenave's mailbox. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Don't move, monsieur, we'll take care of it! I never quite understood what Thierry must have been thinking that night. He had torn the armrest off the sofa and had gotten into his boat to help his wife. There are probably two types of heroes: Those who want to save the world and those who want to save the people they love. I don't know exactly what all this is supposed to teach us. Maybe nothing A SHARK OFF THE COAST OF LA POINTE? But what I do know is that this was all a size too big for La Pointe. We had fought and then wanted to forget it again. This year was the year of the shark. Next year it will be something else. Everything goes incredibly fast these days. But what I wish for most is that this whole circus doesn't attract so many Parisians again. This is Radio La Pointe, it's 10:15 am, so it's time for... - Bernard... - ...and Bernhard - Good morning, Bernard. - Good morning, Bernard. Mayhem and eco-horror this morning in La Pointe. The parking lots turn into bike lanes! The mayor is still hiding behind his plastic visor and flirts with the environmentalists while the police keep... BATHING FORBIDDEN Maja! Wait! What are you doing? I walk, what else? Come on! Do not give up now!
