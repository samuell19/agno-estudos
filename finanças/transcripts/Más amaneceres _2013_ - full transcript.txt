Move it, move it Good evening, good evening You're going to tell me right now where you're going, because I won't allow two beautiful women to walk alone without knowing where they're headed. Thank you very much Mr. Jimenez. We're just going home, around the corner, We're nearly there, but, thank you, we're very grateful Please, forgive me, if I insist but I have to take you because the sun has set and there are a lot of snakes and specially a lot of lowlife drunks with nothing to do. Come on. Honestly, we are nearly there. Thank you very much. Goodnight Maria. Goodnight. Goodnight, young lady. I've always felt that horses hate me. My father told me that horses were good to see men's souls. I never dared to get on one. Until later, my father began to doubt my manhood. Once, he took me to the hill very early in the morning, and in the middle of the bushes he pulled out a gun. He said: "If you don't get on a horse, I'll kill you right here." And he was going to do it. One day I got the courage and I mounted a horse. With all that fear. I hadn't gone far when my grip slipped on the rein. I think the horse felt free and wanted to go faster then broke into a full gallop, and I had no choice but to grab its hair, I couldn't even scream and it went running to the hills. And I let go And I fell. So, what happened? I hit myself on the head pretty bad. But you don't understand, Pedro! Since that day the horses hate me All of them. They look at me, and it's like they are saying with their eyes: "You are not a man." Sometimes, they tell me things. You're drunk, Jacinto! I knew you wouldn't believe me! I don't even know why I'm telling you this. Hell no, it's useless. Hold on a minute, I'm gonna pee. Go ahead. Go ahead. What happened? What happened, Pedro? We were walking My dear! Go to school! You'll be late! Oh my God! Oh my God! Let me see, give me your leg. Put it up! Give me that, come on! -Dad, does it hurt? -No big deal, he'll be up and walking like nothing happened. Come on! Hold him, come on! Hold him! Hey, ¿what's going on? Nothing. How much do you want to bet I can hit it? What? Leave him alone! When we pulled the trap, A little shark about this big, got stuck with the tuna, so we tied it up by the tail and pulled it on deck. There it was, very quiet. We were a good distance from it. but reacted With its last breath, it jumped. Grabbed a hold of his leg. We fixed him up as best as we could. But. It looks serious. Does it hurt? A lot. Here Take him to the town clinic. Have them look at him So, what happened with the shark? Well, we returned it to the sea. It was about this big. Ahh, I see. Alright. Let's take out our dictionaries to look words that start with "b", "bl" and "br" Examples: -Bleach. -Bleach. -¡Break! ¡Break! ¡Bank! -Blouse. ¡Blouse! ¡Blouse! ¡Bank! ¡Brassier! ¡Brassier! Teacher! I need to go to the bathroom! Wait until Maite comes back, and then you can go I need to go Continue, students. -Break -Brazilean. We already wrote down break, what else? Brazil. Brazil, another one. -Brazilian. -Brazilian. Give it to Eva, please. Another one. Brand. Gross! It smells like tuna What? Did someone go fishing today? Tuna!, tuna!, tuna! ¡Silence, students!

Shut up, fucker! Jacinto, Are you sure you don't prefer a clinic? No doctors, no syringes. I don't like this place. This is my favorite time of the day. There's a lot of silence. I can hear what you think. Making a real effort, I can completely see inside of you. Can you see inside of me, too? Yes. We could exchange souls Can we? Yes Although, your soul is bigger than mine So big that it wouldn't fit. in my body He hasn't said a word since dawn. He looks bad. Who is going to care of us when dad dies? I brought you this For me? Girls look prettier when they smile. You didn't like it? My dad is dying How come? His leg is rotting. He has a hole of this size My mom doesn't know what to do. I want him to die. So he can leave us alone But, he's sick, Why are you mad at him? He can't do anything to get better, can he? You don't understand. I do understand. Why don't you go back to where you came from? I do understand. Please, help us! He doesn't talk anymore and he's hardly breathing. Boss, the way he looks, I don't know how long he can hold out. He is an old dog. You know he works hard and respects the sea. He's been here a few years already. By helping him, you are helping yourself. He's a good man, and very useful It's just that his leg got sick And what more do you want me to do for you, huh? I already helped you out as best as I could No, no, there is nothing else to do Please, sir, have mercy! Just lend me a little money so I can take him to the clinic. They can help him there. What about the money I gave you? Did you buy the medication? Yes, boss, but they haven't worked. They haven't worked. Here! Thank you, sir! God bless you! You are a saint! I promise to pay you until the last peso! Really, until the last cent! -God bless. -Enough, enough, enough Hey Make sure Maria and Jacinto never set foot here again, do you understand? It's not good. Jacinto don't work here anymore. And as your friend, you should go looking for ways to help them. Before. You know? Alright, go! We gave him an intravenous drip, His blood pressure has significantly dropped. He will feel a little better but his leg is bad. Well we did what we could, but... But, what? We need to amputate his leg. He has an advanced stage of gangrene. and these things are delicate. oh my god! Unfortunately, we are operating on a very low budget, but we can bring a specialist with all the equipment. We also need the right anesthesia. What's up, uncle? Look, this is the wife of Jacinto, my good friend. and she wants to talk with you. Hold on. Bah! Oh, please! What can I do for you m'am? I humbly come from the my heart. Some people have told me you are a good person, who helps those in need Well, we try to help here and there. What then? How can I help you? My husband is dying. He hurt his leg and now they have to amputate it. And right now, well, I don't have the necessary resources to get him treated I have a twelve-year- old daughter, and we won't have anyone to provide for us -Twelve? -Yes. I don't have much to leave as collateral but So, they 're going to cut his leg off? yes, that's what the doctor told us yesterday, they have to cut it That's too bad. I mean, how How will your husband work? As a gimp. Please Mr. Jiménez. How much do you need? 350 euros I promise to pay you until the last cent. I'll start by making tamales, selling clothes, I don't know, food. Oh, ma'am, look With all due respect, hmm? With all due respect but You're too old to be offering yourself for that amount of money. On the other hand, I mean Your daughter No, no, can't even think about that. What? What does she have to do? Look, in this place we're not in that kind of business that type of loan, or arrangement, no, no, no we do something else. But, I know there are people that deal in other types of loans, other sort of businesses where, I could say, your daughter can fit... Just saying, ma'am, just saying I mean, your daughter, between your daughter ending up there or ending up getting pregnant by some fisherman. -Uncle! But, but, what is it that she has to do? Oh no, no, I don't know, ma'am I know this person but. I've been told, there is a possibility of, well, a person such as your daughter working keeping company with such people I would just need to put you in touch, but i don´t know them okay? It would be a way to solve your problem, right? Now, I mean, think about it Discuss it with whomever you need to, sleep on it, and let me know, okay? Alright? Excuse me. Pedro Yes, uncle. Set that up, will you? She's twelve years old, uncle. And who the fuck asked you how old is she? Look at you now, All of the sudden you like older women now? Huh, asshole? Let me borrow the money, I'll pay you back For what? To pimp out your goddaughter She's your goddaughter, asshole! Is that what you want her for? Oaf! Yes, I want her for myself, but I want her as my wife. Look at you! Just for fucking headaches is what you're good for, bastard! Get the hell out of my sight! Asshole, lazy, perverted, bully! Sad state the world is in, what a shame! God damn it. Hey, what did the tree say to the sky? What's up? Want some? I'm not hungry. Your loss. Are you still mad? Do you forgive me? In the morning, my mom was cleaning him with a rag I don't think he is going to die. No? I don't think so. Nothing happens when it's the leg. Once, at night a scorpion stung me. It was about this big. You are such a liar! They are not that big. That one was. I was really dying that time. So, what happened? Well, I got massive diarrhea, but, then it was like nothing happened. You're gross! What do you want me to say? It's the truth Let me see. Give me your popsicle! Hey, it was mine! Well, I know it was yours. What are you waiting for? Go get it, it's there. You'll see, now you have to buy me one. Keep fasting. Now you have to invite me to eat some cake. We'll see That means yes. Okay. ask your mom for permission. What's wrong with your mom? She did the same thing your father did he left us One day a man told me she was sick. Then, later on, he came back with other men, and they wanted to take her but, that day my mom wasn't that sick, and they didn't take her Sometimes I can talk to her, although... It's been a while. Do you take care of her? Yes, who else? Hey, did you see my socks? They match now. If my dad dies, would you take care of me? Throw it over here, dumbass! Hell no, got get it yourselves, assholes! What happened, son? Everything is so dirty, don't you think? Just look at your pants. Give them to me so I can sew them. How was school? Good, mom. I have a lot of friends Really? You should ask them to come over after school so I can meet them. Yes, they all want to meet you, Especially, a friend. Tell me the story, Of when we first went to the ocean Whew that was so long ago. You were so small. I carried you in my arms and sang you a song you cried the first time, we put in the ocean. but afterwards, you liked the water so much you never wanted to leave, we even called you "duck" Are you sure you want to do this? It's a night for a life She's a girl I really appreciate your help, but it's between Eva and myself, if we make that decision. You are going to sell her like merchandise. God forgive me Jacinto. Is a lost cause. He is not a lost cause, you bastard! All that you want is for him to die you want to form a family with Eva and me I never said I wanted to form a family with you But Eva, doesn't deserve this. Do you know what kind of people my uncle knows? Do you know the kind of shit you are getting into? Get out of my house! Let's go, Evita. There is nothing but decay in this house. Sweetheart. It's okay. I'll do it. I'll do it. No. I want my father to live. And you want him to die. Don't say you never had a choice. Without a father, with a crazy mother, -And without. -Think whatever you want. You heard my mother. We don't need you. That's what I get, For being a fucking idiot. We'll see who helps you in the path you are about to take! Sweetheart Forgive me Where did you come from? From somewhere. Thank you for standing up for me today.

Stay a little longer. -I can't It's just that they're coming for us to fix our problems How are you going to do that? A night, for a life. What? Just like you heard it. Are you going to do it with someone, for the money? Please don't do that. We'll pray all night. If God doesn't want me to do it, he will stop me. How can you say that Eva? You don't know what you're doing. Yes, I do know what I'm doing. God doesn't hear anybody. Don't say that. Look at everything that happens to us. Do you think God punishes us because of nothing? It's a sin what you're saying. I can help you! Its a lot of money You can't help with that! You're a child. -I'm a man -I have to go I can help you! Just give me some time. I'll get a job at the shop, or at the docks. I can help my dad! You don't understand that a woman has to do what she has to do Yeah, I understand. You sell yourself Where did you get this from, huh?

Come in, trust me. It's too dangerous for you to be walking out here. Hold on a second. I'm gonna pee. I'll walk instead.
