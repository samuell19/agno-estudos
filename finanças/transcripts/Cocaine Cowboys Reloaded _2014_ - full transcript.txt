Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Mayor Randy Christmas, of Miami, Florida. The film you're about to see is a stunning expose based on fact. It concerns a vicious attempt by organized crime to take over the entire state of Florida. But for the alert and courageous work of Florida's law enforcement agencies and the integrity of its governmental administrations, this threat might have been made good. I take this opportunity to issue a warning to the people of every state in the nation. It could happen in your state. We are dedicated here in Florida to the belief that it will never again happen to us. [Roberts] My name is Jon Roberts. I was born in New York. I lost my father when I was nine. My mother when I was 13. My stepfather threw me out of the house when I was 13. My sister tried to raise me, failed miserably because of me. I went to see my uncle, and my uncle took me in. First he had me collecting money because he was a loan shark. So he put me with one of his guys who also happened to be the driver for Carlo Gambino. And my uncle said, "Don't worry, this guy will take care of you." Some guy owed my uncle money. We kidnapped him, we threw him in an apartment, and the guy that I used to do it with me was strung out on heroin. I said, "Look, I'm going home to sleep, you watch this guy." Well, he ends up shooting up and OD-ing, so the guy he's watching just opens the door and walks into the street, because my friend's dead on the floor. He ran to the police. The police came, and you know, they got me and they put me in... At that time they had a place called the Tombs in New York, which was one of the original jails. And they came around to the Tombs and they made people offers. If you go to Vietnam and you leave with an honorable discharge, your charges will be dropped. I said, "Okay, that sounds like a good deal." And I signed up for a year, and they interview you. And they said, "Look, we're going to give you advanced training. We're going to send you here and we're going to make you... You can do some crazy things if you want in Vietnam." And what it was for was, it was 101st Airborne, and I got to like it, because I had a bad mentality, and I ended up staying there 4 years. I got blown out of a tree. I got a metal plate in my head, and you know, I don't want to get into stories over there and shit like that, because everybody has a story, so... And when you come back, and you can't do anything, it's like, what am I trained to do? And I lost everything. My uncle, he said to me, "You and I are going to make a lot of money together," and we opened a restaurant there. Opened it? We bought it or took it from somebody, if I remember, back in my childhood. And it was called Alice's Restaurant, and then we went into nightclubs and we opened about four or five nightclubs. It became very big and we were doing really well. One day they just came in, the police, and they told us that our partner, they had found him out on the Long Island expressway. And he had been killed and he had like 11 bullet holes in him. So, who knows what happened to him? The best thing that I could think at that time was, "Just let me get away from all this heat," so I moved down here. And started into the cocaine business. [Buchanan] I think there's something about the location here. It's at the end of the map, the bottom of the map, the jumping off place. People who are running away from each other or from the law or from their own personal demons. Eventually if they run long enough, they come here. [Man] The City of Miami area was very, very quiet, and it was just a very pleasant place to live. [Roberts] Miami back then was the South. It was like Alabama. There was no money here, there were no big buildings. Downtown was pretty barren. Miami Beach, it was a lot of old people just sitting around in rocking chairs on South Beach waiting to die. It was a whole different world down here back then. [Man] I'm an old South Florida boy, and one of the few that's that old, I was born here. I was in the import business, doing some exporting, but mostly importing. [Roberts] Back then the city was like a virgin city. [Man 1] South Florida was vulnerable to penetration by drug suppliers. [Man 2] Florida is a drug smuggler's paradise. It was wide open back then. It was wide open. [Man 1] 1200 miles of coastline, much of it remote, deserted, thousands of rivers and bays. Nobody even knows how many islands offshore. [Man 2] The pirates operated here in the 1700s. During the Civil War, gunrunners would run the Union blockade in from the Bahamas. Rum runners used the same technique. [Munday] This city has always had something coming in. [Man] In the 1960s, this was a jumping-off place for soldiers of fortune, who ran commando raids into Cuba. Several dozen miles south-west of Miami is a military training camp located on 40 miles of Everglades swamp land for Cuban refugees who are planning to return to the island to fight. These guys had been trained by the CIA, had gone into the fishing industry, and they were making a very good living. The change in 1975 was precipitated by a lobster. There was a law changed in the Bahamas which prohibited Cuban exiles based in Miami from fishing in Bahamian waters for the spiny lobster. It put out of work tremendous amount of fishermen. [Man] Obedio Perez sold his gold watch and ring last week to feed his two children. He expects the bank to foreclose on his boat before month's end. Francisco Gado's boat is taking on water from lack of use. He says it might sink before his next payment. More than 1,000 other lobster fishermen, a majority of them Cuban exiles, have not left these docks in six weeks. [Diaz] They had their boats, they had their knowledge, they had the training. That's when we started seeing the mother lode method of transporting marijuana. The fishermen were acting as intermediaries, and the go-fast boats would bring them into the coast. At that time everybody in Florida was smuggling pot. And you could drive in with a boat, stacked up, [Munday]] pull up to the dock and unload it. Nobody said a thing. There was no defense of the border to speak of. [Woman] There were thousands of fishing boats in this area, hundreds of thousands of pleasure boats. Many of them capable of the run to the Bahamas, with another ship on a marijuana delivery cruise out in the Gulf Stream. [Munday] If they thought there was a problem, they'd just throw it overboard. They would order 40,000 pounds and they'd send out 50,000. And they'd only have enough boats to carry the 40 and they would throw the stuff away. You could be out in a boat and find bales of marijuana floating. The proverbial square grouper. You would get guys who would go over, unload the ship, and they would get their dentist or their attorney or their doctor, because forevermore he could tell his grandchildren, "I was a smuggler." [Man] South Florida has become the drug smuggling capital of the United States. No other place in the country even comes close. The first marijuana trip we made, we found through a guy who was a fireman. He had a twin engine plane called the Piper Aztec that he would fly to Colombia. He offered us, if we would go down and pick up 1,000 pounds, $50,000. I really wasn't thrilled about the amount of money it was, but I said, "Well, at least it gets our foot in the door." And we did it. And it was a fiasco from one end to the other. We ended up having to throw it all away. They didn't have an alternate where we came back to. There was a sentinel police officer sitting on the road that they wanted to land on. They used a used airplane radio on an old battery, and they didn't realize the battery was dead. From that trip, our very first trip, with all the problems, we took it as a lesson. From then on in, we'd have one, two, three, four alternates. I ran into some Jamaicans, went down to Jamaica, physically looked at the place. For Jamaicans it was... The pot wasn't really good. We made one trip, brought back 700 pounds, but this time we brought it back to our place. People that I knew, they were all calling the ground crew. They were all my friends, and the vehicles were mine. I tried to control everything. It got to the point where there was so much pot here that you couldn't sell it. It was too cheap. Got down, it was like $230 a pound, and what you had to pay for it, and you figured your expenses and everything, and the chances that you take, legally. [Man] Big seizures used to be measured in hundreds of pounds. It is not unusual now to catch a ship with 30 or 40 tons of marijuana. [Munday] For the same amount of money that you would make on 40,000 pounds, you could bring 1,000 pounds of cocaine and make the same amount if not more. When they were sending, like, all this pot, they would send a few kilos of coke. [Man] As for marijuana, the police might be able to stop it. But as for cocaine, the police have no real answers. [Roberts] In the beginning, it was very small. [Munday] Because it was so expensive. [Roberts] And they would bring them in a suitcase. [Man] In the last year, cocaine seizures have doubled. More than a quarter of all cocaine seizures in the United States were at Miami International Airport. While we were filming a routine day, agents got another one. Five pounds of pure cocaine were hidden in the bag. U.S. Customs said the seizure was worth more than $1,000,000. [Roberts] When I first came down here, I really had no idea what I was going to do, and I worked with a guy training dogs. Agitating the dogs and letting the dogs hit a sleeve and bite me. And doing that, I met a Cuban man out in Hialeah, who became very notorious, very famous down here, and his name was Albert San Pedro. He was in the drug business. It was obvious. I got him a really bad dog. His name was Sarge. He was a German Shepherd. And this dog was crazy. I mean, absolutely nuts. And his stash was under the doghouse on the side of the house. He would lift the doghouse up and he had a cement pad. And in the cement pad he had a safe. And this dog would sleep on this pad day and night. And this was his way of stashing it. Eventually he was my main supplier. He would front me a quarter of a pound, and he would give me like three or four days. And then I would go and bring him the money back. [Woman] Shortly after midnight, Hialeah businessman Alberto San Pedro was arrested again at his palatial home. So far he stands accused of conspiracy to commit murder, drug dealing and corruption. San Pedro brags he controls the majority of the Dade County Commission, its mayor and no less than 15 judges. No mention was made by any of the council members or Mayor Raul Martinez of the San Pedro affair. [Man] There is no organized crime group that's going to challenge the Cubans. In Miami, the Colombian drug organizations stepped into that market. [Man] Worried Colombian authorities say they are now seeing increased coca planting as Colombian traffickers try to take over all phases of cocaine production. [Diaz] it was very clear to us that the Colombians were already getting involved in the distribution area here in the States. The Colombians realized that they were giving up a large portion of the profit to people they really didn't have to give it up from. They didn't need the Cuban as a middleman. And they just bypassed the Cubans completely. That toehold is what sprouted into the crazy 1980s here in Miami. These people didn't have a pilot or plane. They asked if we'd be interested, and I'm trying to be really, really, really careful. You have to be careful of who you meet, who you talk to. You might be the police officer on undercover, because that's really starting to roll at that time. We set up an appointment to meet these people, and what I did was, I bought the most expensive portable tape recorder I could find. And I went to a bunch of different locations. And what I found was the best place of all was a bowling alley. I mean, the noise, the people, the clanging. The reason I'm doing this is, if I'm meeting somebody, and they're trying to record our conversation, I wanted to make sure there wasn't going to be much recorded. And when we got to the place, I had three of my friends outside. We all have radios. There was no cell phones at that time. There were, but they were like this big. When we came out from after the meeting I told them that we'd have to make a decision and we'd get back to them. And I had my friends follow the people home, just to make sure that they didn't go back to the DEA building, the FBI building, U.S. Customs or whatever. And then we sat on them for three days to make sure that they were who they said they were. These people that turned out to be Rafa and Max. They threw a number at us that was more than agreeable. $3,000 apiece or a kilo in your terms, and they wanted to move at least 400, a gross of $1.2 million. I just transported. I took it from them, gave it back to them. Give me money, I'll go again. I wasn't worried about them, because I had no intentions of ever stealing from them. I had no intentions of ever cheating them. All I wanted to do was make money. And money we made. Sunny and Rico at the same bar. How lucky can a girl get? Laura. [Mooney] My name's Toni Mooney. I was born in Miami, Florida. After I graduated high school, I met somebody named Shelton Archer, and he was a photographer. And he came up to me and told me I should be a model. He had a Limey accent. He said he would like to photograph me at the airport. He had a plane. I ended up going with him to his plane in Lantana Airport, and he shot photographs of me. Most models have to struggle, and I must say, because of Shelton, I had a fabulous, very beautiful apartment. He went out and bought me a Mini Cooper. I had a maid, everything. Cash is a whole lot better than plastic, and Shelton always seemed to have plenty of it. And if he didn't he went and got more. He was a photographer. I mean, he seemed like it to me. Of course, it was a little strange he was living in Colombia. Then he told me he had a job for me in Santo Domingo. I didn't realize I was going to know him so well, but we had a plane crash. The first leg of the trip, he woke me up and told me he wasn't sure if we were going to make it. We ended up crash landing the plane. We were there like, seven days. We didn't have any water. We were licking condensation off the plane, and it was quite a mess. Finally, the coastguard came and rescued us. The Bahamians apparently had been looking for us, but once they found out Shelton's M.O., the Piper plane and all that, they just didn't go pick him up, because he had been convicted of drug smuggling there. When they finally picked us up, they believed my story that I was just really catching a ride, and they let me go and they detained him. I flew to Miami, and I was working on a shoot with a girl, and she told me that she had somebody for me to meet. A friend of mine fixed me up with her. He was a lawyer. He was dating this really beautiful girl who was a model for Ford. And he said, "You know, she's got a beautiful friend, and she lives in West Palm, but she works in New York, and I'd like to introduce you to her." And that's how I met her. Her and her boyfriend kept telling me, "Don't do this and don't drink in front of John and don't..." You know, and I was like, "Whoa whoa whoa. Wait a minute here. I don't even want to go." And then we opened the door and there's this guy with this face, you know. He looks so mean, and actually I found out he wasn't. He was a wonderful person. I remember sleeping on the couch, and Jon bringing out blankets and covering me up. The next morning I woke up. I was on the couch. He told me he'd like to take me to see his racehorses. And I loved horses. I grew up with horses. So I said, "Okay." When I was growing up, it was just myself, my brother and my mother. And Jon really put our family together in our eyes. And we really adored him. I mean, there wasn't anything he could do wrong. It's like a dream, you know. You can have anything you wanted. Jon made everything all right. He was a pretty magnanimous person back then. Everything was hunky dory at home and everybody was happy and... But then things changed when he met Shelton. [Roberts] I was selling at that time. The Cubans didn't have big supplies, so I had to search out other people. This girl, who I happened to have been seeing, knew an English guy who was a pilot for these people from Medellin. So she introduced me to him, and he said, "Well, I'm going to hook you up. I can take you to these Colombians that I know, and this guy can give you whatever you want." And I'd heard stories like that many times, so I just said, "Sure, whenever you're ready, let me know." And we drove to Sunny Isles, Florida. And we go into this house. It was about five or six Colombians there, all like, loaded to bear. When I say "loaded," they were strapped. They had pistols, machine guns, and they were all standing around. And at that point I realized this guy is serious. This is for real. I meet this little guy, he can't be more than 5'4"or 5'5". And he introduces himself and he says, "My name is Rafa." And he's telling me, "I'll give you whatever you want. And if you've got some money, I'll front you twice the amount of money that you come with." And I said, "Well, you know, show me something." He takes me in his back room, he pushes a button, and a whole wall opens up like this. And I had never seen so much cocaine in my entire life, just sitting behind this wall. I said, "Okay, I guess you can help me, man." I said, "Give me a day and I'll put together the money, and I'll be back." The next day I came, he had an American guy there, and he introduced this American. He said, "This is my compadre. I'm not in town a lot, but whatever it is you need, this is the man, he'll take care of you. And don't worry about it. He's 100 %." And the man he introduced me to happened to be this man, Max Mermelstein. Jon introduced me to Max. I thought they were going to open a shoe store together or some story like that. [Roberts] Rafa came to trust Max because Max was married to a Colombian woman. She was the cousin of Pablo Escobar, the woman Max was married to. So they had a bond with Max. Max seemed like a very nice guy back then. It seemed that way, anyway. [Roberts] One Sunday, Max had a party out there, and I went out to his farm. The next thing I know here comes this guy, and Max says, "This is my transportation guy. You're going to work with him." He's got like two ATCs, these three-wheelers, and he says, "Max, I brought your ATCs back." And he takes them off the truck. He says, "That one runs about 90 or 100 mph now. That one over there runs around 80." So Max says, "I'm telling you, these guys, these are the shit, man. We don't have any more. This is who you'll work with." So the guy introduces himself. His name is Mickey Munday, and he's like a redneck from Florida, that's been here his whole life. [Munday] I want to say I didn't like him. The first time I meet Jon, he's driving this black Mercedes, two-door, that's got drug dealer written all over it. He just looked like somebody that I don't want to have anything to do with. I think he was okay. He had a big race boat. He was involved in racing. Do you remember the show MacGyver? That's this guy. He could do stuff that just was incredible. And Max had me working with these guys, and he sent me to Colombia. [Man 1] Medellin, Colombia. Right now there is little or no cocaine enforcement activity here. [Man 2] This city only has a population of about 50,000, yet there are about 50 airplanes parked at this airport. [Man 1] The dealers control much of the countryside. [Man 3] This town is completely dedicated to narcotics. Rafa would introduce me to the people he was working with. We met, you might say, the elite of the drug business from Colombia. And it would be the Ochoas-- [man] Here lives a man believed to be one of the most powerful cocaine traffickers in the world: Fabio Ochoa. This is his ranch, and he is treated as a hero here. They were a huge name in Colombia. There was no secret about them. [Man 1] Fabio Ochoa is considered by many as a godfather of the business. [Man 2] Some intelligence officials have charged that you and the members of your family are the biggest cocaine traffickers in the world. I know nothing of lies being told. This doesn't interest me. I am well known by all the horse breeders in the world. My life has been honorable, and I can tip my hat. [Munday] This was Pablo Escobar. [Man] Mr. Escobar by any measure, has to be considered the John Dillinger of the cocaine trade in Colombia. [Munday] And this is Carlos Lehder. [Man 1] Carlos Lehder is wanted by the U.S. authorities for drug trafficking. [Man 2] He stated cocaine was the atomic bomb and he was going to drop it on America. [Man 3] The cocaine traffickers have more power and money than the government. You make it sound like they had an office the size of this with computers and they got 40 secretaries. It's just a bunch of bums down there. [Roberts] Most of these Colombians came from really poor, poor families. And when everybody in this country got into cocaine, it was just like they struck gold. The Beverly Hillbillies, that's basically what it was. The Colombians have farms, fincas they call them, just filled with cocaine down there, because they just kept producing it. They call this the Valley of Orchids. Flowers are a principal export. So is cocaine. More than 20 tons a year. For this valley is the cocaine capital of the world. [Roberts] And it was a whole process. It was like a factory working. Campesinos - peasant farmers - support their families by processing the leaves into coca paste. It was a matter of survival. I mean, there were no other crops that would grow in that environment, and at that altitude in those mountains. [Man 1] The farmer lives off the coca plant, and without it, there is no point in living. [Man 2] Without coca, we would have to die. [Man 3] The coca paste is then taken to processing labs to be made into cocaine. One popular route is this one, along the Amazon River. And in going down the river in a longboat, the guys in the boat would stand up, and they would hold the bags of cocaine, and I remember them shouting, "Coca-roca." And showing it off right there. This is what we have. [Man] There are just too many coca fields, too much money, and too many traffickers. [Munday] At first I thought it was all their stuff. But once you get to the point where you're unpackaging it, they're all marked different. It didn't all belong to somebody. Maybe 50 belonged to this guy, 10 to that guy, 5 to this guy. They would all pool their stuff and send it up. Going down the freight yard, when you get the train full, then you leave, you know. That's what they were doing. [Man] The ships and planes that smuggle it in come to Miami, and then the coke spreads all over the Eastern United States. [Munday] We bought some property in Lakeland, built two runways there, put up a couple of barns that were really hangars. They looked like barns, but when you'd open up the hayloft door, you would see that it was shaped to the tail of an airplane door. I would use a five, six, eight-year-old family car. [Roberts] And we would load 300 pieces. And we would put air shocks on the car, so that the car wouldn't fall to the ground. And we would use a tow truck to tow the vehicle back. [Roberts] They would bring them into Miami. I personally liked to go when there was a big moon up. I call them the "Smuggler's Moon." The moon sitting right there, and it's real big, because we landed with no lights. There was a night, looking at an alternate, where I watched some guys come in off Route 27. They didn't know I'm there. I'm listening to everything they say. I have night scopes and goggles. I'm watching, and I could have been the man to seize them. They came in, and there was a ball of fire. I thought it was like an atomic bomb. I've never seen a flash. If you took a flash camera, went right up to your face and went click, it would not have been as bright. It blinded me because the nights go bloons. And the guy's on the radio, "Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're dying, we're dead," and then boom! Right in front of me, [MIMICS PLANE] it was one of these things. It was an avo. They didn't know they'd put the power wire up since the last time they'd been out there. He hit it with the top of the nose, went over the top of the airplane, took all the antennas off and chopped the tail right off. And his friends all hauled ass. And so did he, and left a little thing in the plane that I took. A whole lot of little things. It was a rather worthwhile night, for all I did was go out there to look for an alternate. [Roberts] Mickey's operation was a very sound, very good operation, although it was limited. [Munday] They wanted us to go more often. Bigger airplane or something. And that's when we purchased a Cessna Conquest. We paid $980,000 for it. In cash. How do you like that? You try that one today. We'd made one trip with it. [Roberts] Sometimes you just get bored, I guess. In that particular trip, I went up there, not to unload it or put it on the truck. We were just hanging out. [Munday] The pilot knew he was going to have a problem when he could see the lights out of Tampa on the horizon, which meant he was too high. If he could see the lights of Tampa, that meant that they could see him with radar. [Roberts] Next thing I know, wham. These cars start flying by. Police cars. Here comes a chase plane. [Munday] First they were chasing him with the military airplanes. Here come my guys, who had the cars up there, flying into the restaurant, "What's up, what's up?" "We got to get out of here, we got to get out of here." [Munday] And the military realized that it wasn't a threat, and by then they'd called in the U.S. Customs. [Roberts] Cops are everywhere, all over this stuff. Everybody is going to go out the door. You don't throw nothing away. You throw everything away. First the co-pilot would go out. Fifteen, 20 minutes later, the pilot would go out and would leave the plane on autopilot and give it to the Bermuda Triangle. And nobody believed that I lost the load, and I said, "I lost it, man. These guys will tell you I lost it." And he said, "Well, why isn't it in the paper? Show us the article in the paper." You know what I mean? When it first happened, of course, they don't. There's nothing in the newspaper. And you needed to bring them proof, but I couldn't prove it. I had no way to prove it. Man, they came flying to my house with machine guns and cruise killers. [Mooney] I remember my brother and I were out on the porch, and these two guys drove up. Rafa came. They get out of the car with guns. [Roberts] "You fucked us. You took our load." And of course me, I go right over, get in his face and start screaming, "Get off my property, blah, blah, blah." Colombians were actually afraid of this woman. [Mooney] Next thing I know, Jon comes out of the house, my brother comes out of the house, and they both have weapons drawn. And standing there with a laser shotgun and-- She didn't give a shit who came. Rafa could bring six, seven guys. And she was a big girl and Rafa was only like 5'5", and she was looking down at him, screaming and screaming. Of course, there I am, screaming. "You ain't coming in my house today." It looked like they were going to have a gun battle right there. "What are you, crazy? For this amount, why would I take your load?" I could have ripped them off, but I didn't do it. "Are you nuts? I'm working tomorrow. I'm doing 1,000 tomorrow. Why wouldn't I take your 1,000?" Five hundred kilos compared to what I'm bringing every week. It just wasn't worth it. [Munday] it wasn't until the next day, and then I started reading about all the stuff being found. [Roberts] And that's the proof with the paper, because when you hand them the article, "480 kilos Busted in Yeehaw Junction." And of course they realized that we weren't stealing it. Okay, here's my 480 kilos. We have to get rid of it. "It's not our problem, it's your problem." But without the paper you had no proof. Unfortunately, we lost a $1 million airplane and they lost whatever it cost them for their part, so they write it off. And we wrote it off too. [Roberts] Rafa was crazy like that, and I guess it was because he did so much coke he would get paranoid. He was just a little guy that was kind of crazy, and you had to be a little leery of him because he would get high. He'd smoke the shit. He would take like half of the tobacco of the cigarette, put cocaine in it, a little tobacco back in, and smoke it. One time, a trip was on for Saturday, and some kind of problem had come up and I needed one more day. Max was out of town, so I get to Max's house, and I go on into the dining room. Rafa is there, sitting at the head of the dining room table. I thought it was marijuana, but it turned out not to be. A circle about this big and about that high. And he's using like a credit card or something to keep it in shape. What it is is tobacco from a cigarette. There has been so many cigarettes that he actually has a pile of tobacco this big. And he's had that much to smoke that there's that much tobacco. And I'm going, whoa! And he's like, drooling. And the people there are all scared to death of him, because he could say something and somebody would be history, and I go, and I go... And I don't speak Spanish, and I've got to try to tell this guy who was higher than a kite, that we needed one more day. I ended up having to get Max's son, which I really didn't want to do, because the kid was only like, 14 years old, to translate for me, and then make sure that somebody there would call, because I don't want to send my plane the next day and there's nobody there. But he was in one of his binges. And those who knew had to be afraid of him. It's amazing. Here was a guy who made so much money... Rafa really controlled almost every kilo of coke that came into this country through the people from Medellin. There was nobody higher than him for the Medellin Cartel in this country. He was a little Napoleon. I often wondered how much money somebody who had been fairly sharp could have possibly made, instead of some guy who was a drug addict. Mickey then started to do air drops. I built me a small boat factory to play with, and we decided to do Colombia up to the Bahamas, air drop it to boats. [Roberts] And they had beacons that they would drop, and they would be able to know exactly where the load was, because there would be a frequency that would send back to where it was. The middle console would open up. They'd put holes in the middle of the boat, and you would fill them up. [Munday] And then bring it in with boats. Sometimes I would run what we call the front door. The front door would be the entrance at Haulover. We would call it a front door. You can't say, "Why are you coming in Haulover? We say, "You're coming in the front door." It's a code of sorts. At the Haulover Inlet, I rented an apartment on the 12th floor in the north-east corner called the Harbour House, which has a spectacular view of the inlet. And I put a young lady there, and I
