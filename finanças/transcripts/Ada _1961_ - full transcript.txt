...and my very great pleasure to introduce the friend to the poor white men, the friend of the rich white men, and the negro, and all men... The next governor of this great state, my very good friend, Bo Gillis. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Mr. chairman, friends, I guess you folks know how the big newspapers keep at me for not making these fancy speeches. Well, they say if a man's running for office and he kinda likes to sing, well, he's lacking in stature. I ain't exactly sure what that means, they could be right, anyway they got no cause to find fault with me tonight 'cause in this here speech... Let me have the speech, please... in this here speech, I'm up to my ears in stature. No, I mean that, just like the administration's candidate, I got me a college man. Come up here, Steve. A real smart boy to put in some very big fine words. Yes, sir, I got some real ding-dongers here tonight. Stuff like this, uh, the incumbent. That means a gang down state with sticky fingers and big pockets. Now, the incumbents wallowing in the slimy trough of public corruption. Now, before I got stature, I'd of just said no wonder there's a depression, these boys been grabbing all the money, yours and mine. And it's about time we spread a little of their prosperity around. Oh, I got a lot more stature here. I got about 46 pages of corruption, which I'm against, and about 49 with good government, which I am for. Nice night, ain't it? ♪ May the lord bless you real good ♪ ♪ may the lord bless you real good ♪ ♪ I've spent a lot of time praying that he would ♪ ♪ may the lord bless you real good ♪ ♪ may the lord up above bless you real good ♪ ♪ may you find happiness in your neighborhood ♪ ♪ I've spent a lot of time praying that you would ♪ ♪ may the lord bless you real good ♪ I won't need a new speech, Steve. That stuff about stature, that never misses. Tomorrow you're talking to businessmen. Some of them might want to hear words with more than one syllable. Last night did good today. Didn't I have four speeches, two committee meetins'? And besides all that singing, I can't think of anybody that deserves a party more than I do. That's right, you did fine. Businessmen, educators, representatives, the kind of people I meet today, you know, if I didn't have you around, I'd die of lonesomeness. And at that, you can talk over my head half the time. But I listen well. I'll bet you never thought when we were kids you'd be writing speeches for me, did ya? You win your bet. Steve. Yeah. Does it strike you funny that in a few months I might be governor of this whole state. Fairly funny. I'm serious Steve, you're the one with all the education. You know how much schooling I had. I didn't think you had any. Listen, I know exactly how much schooling you had, and you're two years up on Andrew Jackson. Who's he? He's finally here. How are ya? Good to see ya. How are ya? It's really good to see you. Good, how are ya? Judge. Thanks very much. Anybody here? They're all here, sheriff. Every politician in the county got to work. Good, here. Alice, you've really done yourself proud on such short notice. Thanks, colonel. Some businesses improve during bad times. Yeah, Alice, you got an especially good one picked out for Bo Gillis? What kind does he like? He likes the good kind. Okay, I'll look into it. Thank you. Hello, Ada. Doesn't look like you need me, Alice. Oh, you don't know what I got in store for you tonight, honey. The suspense is killing me. Now don't tell me you wouldn't be impressed if you were gonna entertain the next governor. Do they make governors different from other men? Not from what I've been told. Hey, everybody, Bo Gillis is here. Everybody, Bo Gillis! Friends, sheriff Bo Gillis here of Collins county has been going through a mighty grooming campaign, and he ain't about to let up until election day. But my invite to him tonight is strictly non-political, in fact, he's here to forget about speechmaking. Mighty fine of you, colonel, all this. I know how tough campaigning could be, I been doing it myself for 20 years. What does Sylvester think your chances are? Oh, Steve would know more about that then me. Well, we're solid in the country but we still got an uphill battle in the cities. Sylvester would like to know how much he can expect from you. Well, so you tell him that about a week from today I'll give him a count that won't vary one single vote from the election day total. You run a capital organization. Thanks to Sylvester, he showed me how. Are you the man from the people, for the people? That's me, yes ma'am. Reckon you've seen his face plastered all over the countryside, eh? I've seen it. Why don't you tell me some more about it while we dance? I'd be delighted. Well. Well what? Tell me about yourself. Haven't you read my campaign literature? So many things to read, you know how it is. You heard my speeches. No, make one for me now. Well, I can't without my writer. You the one who campaigns with a guitar? How come you don't know anything about me? I'm new in town. - Really? - Uh-huh. Well, it's always nice meeting someone new. Why? I don't know why. Tell me about your plans when you become governor. What are you gonna do for the people? Well, I... Let's go someplace where we can talk. Anything you say, governor. - Bo. - Oh, hi, Steve, I wanted to... Listen, you've got an important meeting tomorrow at noon. Wait a minute, Bo, no girls, if you want to be governor, there's certain things you're gonna have to give up. This kind of nightlife tops the list. I ain't governor yet. How do you like the party, Steve? Oh, it's a beauty. I'm sorry about my friend but he kinda keeps an eye on me. It's nice to have friends. He's a smart young man. You want a drink? Not while I'm working. Oh, tell me about yourself? What would you like to know? I don't even know your name, yet. Ada. Ada, well, that's a fine name. My daddy had a workhorse named Ada, maybe he thought some of it would wear off on me. You sure I can't get you anything? You don't have to treat me like company. Where are you from? Alabama. Montgomery? Smith's crossing. Smith's Cro... well, you're a country girl? Yeah, I'm a country girl. Well, me too, I'm right from out of the hills, right around these parts here. How long ago? You mean you never wore shoes till you were 14, like me? Maybe that's why these hurt my feet so much, or it could be your dancing. You sure I can't get you some ginger-ale or something. All right. A piece of ice, two, ginger-ale, and I didn't spike it. You're a fine looking woman, Ada. How come you're running for governor? I'm just running, that's all. Well, how did it happen? Well, I've been sheriff of Collins county for two terms. Won both elections by a landslide. Look at that, one, two. I just don't understand it. What's to understand, one night I was playing my guitar in a nightclub, some political bigwig walked in and he says, "you've got appeal, how would you like to be in politics?" I said, "I don't mind," before I knew it, I was campaigning for sheriff. That's all there was to it? Kinda surprises me too, sometimes. I think I'll go out and buy a guitar. You're different from most, Ada. So are you. Well, I mean it. You make me wanna... I don't know, just talk all over the place, and I really mean talk. Well, you learn something everyday. What have you learned today? Well, I didn't think there was anything left in the world for me to be curious about. You sound like you've had some education. Oh, I've been exposed to a lot of different people. I don't mean to be prying or anything, but how did you end... My family went broke on five-cent cotton, then we scrabbling on chairs eating black-eyed peas and cornbread, when we could get it. And that was only the beginning. I never could break myself from the habit of eating. I have the same problem. You know, I think I'll vote for you, Mr. Gillis. Well, being from Alabama, you probably aren't even registered. Well then, I'll just have to contribute to your campaign. Just put it right here. Oh, never mind about that, that's all right. - Well, thank you, ma'am. - Close the door on your way out. Sure. Mr. Gillis, it's after 11:00. You said something about a political meeting at noon. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mr. Gillis, Mr. Gillis. Well, good morning, honey. Boy, if you don't look like a rose in a garden. Aspirin, tomato juice, soft-boiled eggs. Stop looking at me that way, I'm not on the menu this morning. You sure do know how to take care of a man. You do have a meeting, don't you? Honey, that's the story of my life, meetings. Mr. Gillis, would you kiss your playmate goodbye and let's go. don't rush me, I'll be right along. I hope you know enough to keep your mouth shut, ma'am. don't mind him, honey, Steve's all right, he just let education go to his head, what are you... What's the matter with you, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you're trying to throw the election. Why don't you lay off? You start talking in 30 minutes, they're gonna ask you questions. It's a businessman's luncheon. I think you should give 'em eight words about taxes... I would like to say here and now that Bo Gillis is not a reformed candidate. What reforms has he suggested... ♪ May the lord bless you real good ♪ ♪ may the lord bless you real good ♪ ♪ I've spent a lot of time praying that he would ♪ ♪ may the lord bless you real good ♪ ♪ I've spent a lot of time praying that he would ♪ More tea? Thank you. In three weeks time you've won just about everyone's vote around here. Yeah. You expect a lot of trouble in the cities? I don't know. Why you going to Memphis? I've had enough of small towns. You got somebody in Memphis that you care about? Only me. Ada, I'm a hunch player. Swell, let's play some time. My hunch is that we should be together. Oh, that'd be cozy. Is there a back door to the governor's mansion? Oh, come on, Bo, this is our last night. Ada, I don't want any other man near you. Nobody, you understand? Sure. Let's get out of here, Bo, get some air... Please. Will you stay if I marry you? Did you hear me? I heard you. I know it's sudden, but I've done everything in my life sudden. I go by my feelings. No wonder they have that guy tramping around after you. You need watching. I need you, these past three weeks have been the best time of my life. Having somebody to talk to, somebody to share my troubles with, my laughs. I'm a lucky man, Ada, but not 'cause I'm runnin for governor, 'cause I met you, and I'm not giving you up. I'd be good to you, Ada. You'd be good for me. don't you know girls like me are always looking for a hand up. What's wrong with that? Somebody had to help me. Well, you're no kid, you know what you're buying. I don't want you to talk about yourself like that ever again. Bo, Bo is this it? Yeah, this is where I hang my hat these days, thanks to Sylvester. Let's go in, Mrs. Gillis. - Hi, Steve, come on. - Where have you been? The old man's in there, he's been looking for ya. - Oh, I want you to meet... - What's she doing here? We got married. You married her? Yes, last night. Come on, I want you to meet Sylvester. Hi, Sylvester. Oh, I hope you forgive the liberty of my making myself at home at your table. That's all right, any time at all. We had a meeting for all the county sheriffs scheduled for ten o'clock. I know you're not generally tardy unless... Unless there's a pressing reason. Well, there was this morning, Sylvester. I put them off till next Friday. I want you to meet my bride. This must be the Sylvester you've told me so much about. I'm very pleased to meet you. Ah, forgive me if I don't rise. I have a touch of arthritis these days, or perhaps I'm just not as young as I once was. Well, Bo, tell us all about it, huh? Well, what's to tell, we got a marriage license in Fairmont junction, and we used it. I feel a little neglected never having met the bride, or even heard her mentioned. Have you had that pleasure, Steve? No, I haven't. The county clerk at Fairmont, isn't he our man. That's right, TW Wallace. Let's get in touch with him, huh, see that the marriage license is taken out of the files. Didn't I make myself clear? Well, not to me, you didn't. I'm married, Sylvester, so what's all the fuss about? Who is this young lady, where does she come from, what's her background, who are her people? What's that got to do with anything? The voters are gonna wanna know, Bo. Is it something we can tell them? She's Mrs. Bo Gillis. To put it very bluntly, miss... Mrs. I think this might be a very painful discussion for you. Would you care to take a chair in the other room till we get things ironed out? I don't think I'd like to turn my back on you, Mr. Sylvester. In that case, then, perhaps we can... Perhaps we can ask William to bring you some coffee. - Sit down. - Sit down. William, bring some more coffee, will you please? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Well now, public office is a very demanding position for a man to find himself in, Bo. Three weeks before the election, why it'd be... It'd be fool-hearted to take a chance on the unexpected or the unknown. Your young ladies vote for these things. I think, perhaps under the circumstances, an annulment. Sylvester, I'm married and I'm gonna stay married. Well, then the thing to do, I suppose, is to write an official biography for ya, miss, to be used in our campaigning, huh. You'll forgive us if we take a few slight liberties with the truth? Well, I don't see why you shouldn't. I have from time to time. Yes, ma'am. William, you can clear the table now, Mr. Sylvester's all through. Pardon me. - Mrs. Gillis. - Yes. The newspaper men are here for pictures. - I'm ready. - Oh, good. You look fine, but I wouldn't wear that scarf. Well, you'd look silly if you did. That's true, I would. Say, Ms. Gillis, when you talk to these reporters, I'd like to suggest you not say... I suggest you stop worrying about me, I'm not gonna spit on the floor. Just one more question, Mr. Gillis... - How do you think Mrs. Gillis... - Are you planning a family? Now you're getting the pretty one in the family. - Come here, Hun. - Good morning. Just hold his arm, please. Fine, fine. We would like another one. One more please, take another one. Just a few questions, Mrs. Gillis. How long were you engaged to Bo? Well, too long. Would you say it was love at first sight? Well, I'd say that yes, but confidentially, I took a second look. About yourself, Mrs. Gillis? Now, gentlemen, my husband's running for office, I'm not, what I've done or what I haven't done couldn't possibly interest more than two of your readers, Bo and myself. I don't agree, people wanna know... I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, we just don't have any time. We've got a long drive to Sylvester's house. You all don't have to rush off, William's gonna bring you whatever you'd like to drink. Excellent, William. See if these folks want anything. Thank you. Oh, no more for me, I've had two already. I made it, it's my mother's recipe, Mr. Gillis. Well, ma'am, whether I'm elected governor or not, this pecan pie has been the high point in my campaign. - This is delicious. - Well, thank you, sir. I wonder if you'd be kind enough to write down that recipe and send it to me, I'm a bride, just learning. Oh, I'd like that! It isn't like you to miss a train. How come you didn't give him a big one? The newspapers woulda eaten it up. don't you think we better stick to our problem, gentlemen? The election's only three weeks from tomorrow. Personally, I feel you're being a little too pessimistic. Betting on Bo's still eight to five. That's the story we gave out. No, we mustn't be fooled by the fine show Bo's making in the rural areas, the farmers are for him, yeah. It's the cities, where the newspapers be pecking away at us. That's where we're in trouble, big trouble. Question is, what are we gonna do about it? Now I suggest that with a little encouragement, say a crisp two dollar bill, we might get them to the polls and voting live. That's an expensive way of doing things, Sam, not always too successful, but we'll bear it in mind. You mean we'd seriously consider buying votes? The reform ticket? So the reforms could we bring about if we're not elected, huh? Ronnie, I'll tell ya something. I admire your ideals, that's one reason you were picked to run for lieutenant governor, but ideals are worthless without the heart and law of common sense. If what we have to do seems a little... A little disturbing to you, try to remember this. If you want to grow a beautiful rose, there's nothing like a touch of manure. Ah, excuse me, gentlemen, help yourselves, excuse me. You look like a man that has just accomplished a very useful mission. - Have ya, have ya? - Maybe. I knew it, that mealy-mouthed bag of hot wind. Did you get the affidavit from that woman? No, sir, I'm afraid we were way off on that one. It seems the man our friend Bo's running against is purer than triple distilled butter milk. You found out nothing? About the other candidate, not a thing, but, about his wife, Mrs. Lorraine Henrietta Keely... What about Mrs. Keely? Since last April, when she had a major operation, it seems the old girl's been taking stuff to ease the pain, and now it's become what they call a habit. Interesting? Very, come and have some coffee. Yes, sir. Did I do all right? Just like Lincoln at Gettysburg. You were wonderful, Ada! Hasn't this been a wonderful day? Just wonderful, Ada. You handled yourself so beautifully. Mrs. Gillis, Mrs. Gillis, ah, do you remember me? I'm afraid you must be mistaken. You must remember me. You heard what the lady said. She looks just like this girl I knew in Alabama, I'm sure I know her. Uh, you don't know, the lady says she doesn't know you. Well, she must have a twin sister. All right, come on, we don't want any trouble here. Mrs. Gillis. Thank you, Mr... Uh, Yancey, colonel Yancey. Incidentally, if you do have a twin sister, I sure would admire to meet her. Here she comes. It's her. Ah! Would you like some more coffee? Yes, thank you, William. Where's Bo? Well, he's still asleep, why aren't you? Well, stories like this keep me awake. Well, how did a thing like this happen? Ask Sylvester, he'll probably be along in a few minutes. What for? Probably a celebration. Oh, you have a nice wholesome outlook this morning. Well, you can't argue with the timing, especially when it's a well known fact that we're behind in the cities. What are you trying to say? Oh, come off it, Mrs. Gillis, we both know that you've been out of the girl scouts for a long time. You think Bo or I know anything about this? Let's just drop the whole sorted mess, shall we? Who do you think you are talking to me like that? Good morning, Mr. Sylvester. I've had a very trying morning. I asked that you all be assembled when I got here. We seem to be missing Bo. Oh, I'm here. I don't suppose you've read the papers. No, I haven't. Last night your opponent's wife was picked up on a narcotics charge. It's all right here, Bo. Not all of it, my dear. She was let out on bail, she went... she went back to the house where she lives with her husband and shot herself in the head. Oh, God, the poor woman. Very sad, very, very, sad. But our colleagues tell me that we'll win the election by at least 200,000 votes. My boy, I have a father's pride in you today. I know you're gonna bring luster and honor to the office. I hope I'm allowed to be spared these next four years so I can be at your side, and give you all the help I can, governor. You can't go in there, you know what time it is? Come on, I'm the governor elect's wife. What do you want? We'd just like to look around. What do you mean look around at this hour? I wouldn't tangle with her, this is the governor elect's wife. And this is Bo Gillis. Oh, congratulations, governor. I was just listening to the five o'clock news. When I heard you won, and by a landslide, Mr. Gillis, I sure felt good, real good. Why did my election make you feel good? Why, because that office in there has been needing a strong man, needing one bad. Thank you, thank you very much. Do you mind if we look at the new office, if it's all right? Surely, surely, come along. Hello, this is your new governor. This is Mrs. Bo Gillis. Right in there. Here we are, Ada. So this is where it all happens. Where the laws are made, buttons are pushed, some pockets get filled, and others get emptied. If only my old man were alive to see this. True leadership is strong, generous, just. Those are good words. You know something, Ada, I'm scared. What's there to be scared of? How can a fellow like me be accredited to that office? Who am I to be sitting behind that desk? You're the governor! You're the man the people like, and they want you here, and I want you here. Look, Bo, this is a big job, be big, fill it up. But when I see all this, I'm not so sure I wouldn't settle for being back on the farm. Well, I won't settle, I've settled all of my life and I'm through with that. Now, Bo, you're not alone, there are two of us now. We'll put our heads together and really make things hum around here. Well, I said if I got it, I'd do a good job. And you're going to. If you say so, honey. I never thought I'd be a lady, let alone a first lady. Life's a wonder, sugar. Pardon me, pardon me. This is a great day. You've met this gentlemen, governor, but they want to give you and Ms. Ada a special greeting on this notable morning. Now this is Mr. James orphan, your highway commissioner, excuse me, Mr. Harold Drescot, board of health, Mr. Howard Webstin, board of liquidation, tom Depaul, you know, and the commissioner, Clinton Dokell, Mr. Clinton Dokell, department of conservation. Excuse me, come along, excuse me, pardon me, pardon me. Hello, Ada, remember old friends? Why, sure, Alice, how are you? Oh, honey, you know my lieutenant governor, Ronnie, my best friend, my right hand man. You and me, boy, we'll pull that old wagon together. We sure will. Oh, hi, Steve. - Congratulations. - Well, thank you for everything. That's my job, anytime you need anything, you just let me know. - Well, wonderful, wonderful. - Now, you read these. Okay, but don't you go too far away. I won't. Got a lot of wads here. Governor, sir. Mrs. Gillis, ma'am. I just stopped by to pay my sincere respects to both of you. Ada, honey, you remember colonel Yancey, chief of state police, colonel of infantry. You're now looking at a certified brave and fearless young man. I want you to know that the police organization of this entire state is at your disposal, night and day. In other words, you can fix a parking ticket. My job is to stick very close to you folks. And I do my job. That boy, he's far too big for those whipcord breeches. Oh, honey... I just still can't believe all this, it all don't seem real. Oh, it does to me. You know, I've always had the feeling that life owed me something real special, and this is just the first payment, Bo, you wait and see. Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. You wanted to see me? Yes, I wanted to see you. What's wrong around here? Well, nothing that I know of, Bo's down at the capitol building, you're here gracing the executive mansion, I'd say that God's in his heaven and all's right with the world. You're a public relations man, aren't you? Yeah? Well, then why are you doing nothing about me? I wasn't aware that anything had to be done about you. Just what is the social standing of the governor's wife? Depends on who's the governor and who's the wife. In other words, the office means nothing? I didn't say that, the office means a great deal. Well, then why aren't we being entertained by a few of the people who count around here? I mean, like the queen bees of the social set, the big-timers, people like this Mrs. Maude Penmore. She's giving giving a fancy tea party on Friday and I'd like to go. Well, do you know the lady? I want to, Mr. Jackson. Not that I'm too crazy about tea parties, but I hate not being asked. Look here, these old families don't fool around much with new ones, they're what you call a gentry. What are we, trash? - They call the... - That tea party's Friday at the colonial house. I'll try pulling a few strings. You try pulling ropes, Mr. Jackson. I suppose we would have met before, but we don't come to town much anymore, we stay down on the Gulf most of the year. I understand. Sally-Ann, you gonna open a hermitage this year or not? Well, I'd like to know who'd get the catenian bar if I didn't. Do you know the Gulf at all, Mrs. Gillis? Well, no, I'm afraid I don't. Oh, you're from South Winston, aren't you? I remember reading all about it in that article on you in the gazette. Oh, I thought, you know, your photographs don't do you justice, Mrs. Gillis. Thank you, so much. Um, as for that uh, writer, didn't it strike you as rather peculiar? In what way? Well, I read every single word and there was never even a mention of your family, your people? Oh, I insisted on that. Insisted? Why yes, you see, the way my momma felt, there were only three times in a lady's life when her name should be mentioned in the newspapers: When she was born, when she got married, and when she died. Both momma and daddy've been mentioned all three times. - Oh, I see. - Yes. Oh, Maude! Maude, dear... You're the hostess! So stop stuffing yourself with those teacakes and come over here and talk to us. Oh, you girls have met the governor's wife? Well, I should think so, she's my guest. Dear Mrs. Gillis has been kind enough to forgive me for voting against her husband. Our only defense is I simply can't stand guitar music. What a shame. You miss so much. Uh, Mrs. Gillis is from South Winston, Betty-may here knows everybody in South Winston, she's got kin-folk there. Oh? We must have all kinds of friends in common. Remember kitty Wainwright? Well, I've been away quite a while, school, travel... I just don't understand how you missed old kitty Wainwright. She's on every committee in town. I hope that all you ladies can come and have tea with me one afternoon, at the executive mansion. - That would be nice. - That would be very nice. - Thank you so much - that'd be very nice. Oh, Mrs. Gillis? There's somebody I'm sure you'll remember. Janna Dainsley? Who? Surely you remember Janna Dainsley! She is South Winston. Well, I think you mean she "was" South Winston. How's that? Honestly, I could bite off my tongue. It's quite possible that story isn't true. What story? Oh, please, don't ask me to repeat it. It may be nothing more that vicious gossip. Mrs. Gillis, Janna Dainsley is 84 years old. There's no one in all South Winston who wouldn't agree that she's one of the finest examples of Southern womanhood. Like I said, that story probably isn't even true. I wondered if the governor's wife isn't pulling our leg. I suspect she doesn't come from South Winston at all. Fess up, where are you from, Mrs. Gillis? Okay, I'll tell you! I'm a sharecropper's kid from off the delta road. I'm sure none of us mean to be so unfriendly to you, Mrs. Gillis. Oh, you'll warm up. Mrs. Dunstock, your husband is the director of St. Ann's hospital, isn't he? Yes. Mrs. Dunford, your husband owns a printing company, the one that handles all the state publications? We've been in business a hundred years. Uh-huh! Mrs. Bradville, your husband is the principal officer in the Gulf canning company? - Why yes. - Uh-huh. You live pretty high off the hog all of you, with the aid of state contracts and such. So, if you ladies would like to maintain your standards of living, you'll join me in another cup of tea... Because my husband is the governor... And you know that old saying: You can't fight city hall. I heard about the most marvelous new diet the other day, guarantees it takes five pounds a week off you. You don't eat anything but crow. - What happened to my car? - Your driver just left. I sent him home, Mrs. Gillis, we'll use my car. Just what is this all about? Well, we got some crackpot letter in the mail this morning. Crazy threats, you know the kind? Some crank sees your picture in the newspaper and he gets a little excited. Course it probably don't mean nothing, but, we can't take any chances. I understand, thank you. That's a mighty nice outfit you're wearing, ma'am. It's very becoming. How is it so late in the day, you just looked like you just stepped out of the shower? Now, where'll it be, Mrs. Gillis? Where would you like to go? I'm going home. Well, what are you stopping here for? Well, I thought you might like a little drink ma'am. They got a rum drink in here that'll give you a real down-to-earth... You're way out of line, Yancey! You sure think the worst of me, don't you ma'am? I don't think about you at all. Well, I'm so sorry to hear that, I was only trying to make your afternoon more pleasant. Well, you're not! I certainly don't mean to offend. You know what's funny... You never know what's gonna make a woman happy, or what's gonna put up on her temper. I guess I just had you figured all wrong, didn't I? All wrong. Well, I sure ain't gonna do that again, ma'am. No, I promise you that. We gonna be seeing a lot of each other for the next four years, maybe more. Best to stay on good terms with you. Yes sir, I'm gonna be just as respectful and helpful to you as I know how. Well you can begin by getting back behind that wheel. Any way you want it, ma'am! I'm gonna stay on the good side of you. And while you're at it, adjust that mirror. Well, you caught me at that too, didn't ya? You know, miss Ada, you're bound to be admired. "A cat can look at a king," as the saying goes. There's nothing in the world you can do about that. Tom? Tom, you old cotton-picker! Afternoon, governor. Come on in, tell me your troubles. Sure would like to, Bo. How about seven across the street? I'll buy you a beer. No, thanks, got an appointment. Okay, Tom, maybe some other time. Bo, can I ask you to come up for a moment? I'll be right along, Sylvester. Might as well transfer my calls up to Sylvester's office. Ah, Bo, my boy, got several little things here ready for your signature. What are they? Oh, just some routine authorizations for the commissioner of finance. Legal language is a little heavy-going, huh? There are a lot of words. Bo, what's the matter with you, you seem a bit down? Something worrying you? Oh, Sylvester, I... Talk freely! Well, aside from me signing my name 100 times a day, I, uh, I'm not doing much work around here. Sit down, Bo, sit down. That is if you don't mind a hard chair. I find a hard chair keeps a man awake. Bo, I had no idea you were unhappy in office. Well, I'd like to do more than just wave at the traffic as it passes my office to get to yours. I thought you understood you weren't gonna be bothered by the mechanics of the job, I hoped you'd allow me to take that burden off you. I don't want you to think that I'm complaining, or anyth... Bo... My wife died twenty years ago. I've had a long and lonely time here since then. A seat at the dining room table or a chair on the front porch can't take the place of a wife, children, family life, so... So I decided to put my energies into public service. Then, one day up in Collins county, I found you, you were young, vigorous, ready... Ready to be helped and moved up. I decided to make you the son I never had. That's why you'll find me at your side, Bo. Yeah, but you, you give me a big job to do and you don't let me do it. All in good time, my boy. Right now, your biggest job is to pick up your check each month. Bo... I'd like you to sign, please. The bottom right-hand corner. I suppose if a leaf came sailing through that window you'd get me to sign that too. You reap us for the good of the state, yeah. Controller's office sent some papers up to be signed. Oh, I don't want to bother you if you're busy. Oh, it's not bother, honey, I'm just signing my name. What are those papers you're signing? I don't know, Sylvester sent them down from the controller's office. You know, the other day I did 173 signatures in one hour. Wait a minute... don't you read them? Oh, ah, Sylvester reads them. Bo, don't let Sylvester push you around! Oh, Sylvester's been in government all his life. I'm just what they call a "political hayseed." If he finds out he can push you around, that's exactly what he's going to do! You're the one the people elected, Sylvester can't do a thing without you! I was a nothing candidate, now I'm a nothing governor. Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself! Not a law can be passed in this state until your name is on it. You're the one who's important, Sylvester needs you! I'll bet you were a tough little girl. I'm a tough big one. Yeah... all right, I will. Thank you. Bo, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, come on in. These new state parks... Who's riding the gravy train? What are you talking about? I just had a look at the bill. One's setting up a dozen new state parks. Ronnie, this is all news to me, I don't even know about a park bill. You're not serious? I don't think you understand the way the old man and I work together, Ronnie. It's beginning to become very clear to me. Oh, now, wait a minute, Ronnie. Oh, Bo... we both come out of Collins county. We've been very good friends for a long time. The way I got it figured, I'm your assistant. I can't come to you and level with you, who can I go to? Well, you go right on ahead and level! The bill describes the exact location of each new park. Thousands of acres of valuable land are involved. Who owns that land? Who's selling to the state? Who's fixing the prices? You sure about all this? The only thing I'm not sure of is who's getting rich off this deal? He's not in, governor. - Well, where is he? - At the health club. Your secretary told me I'd find you here. Bo, glad to see you're taking care of yourself. Man should never lose sight of the fact that his health's one of the most important things he has. How about working up a little game of handball, governor? - Not right now, thank you. - Right on, do you good, - good for you. - Some other time, thanks. I'd like to talk to you about the public parks bill. We'll talk later, Bo, this is no place to discuss matters of state. I don't want to talk later, I want to talk now! What's wrong with you, something upset you? I just want some answers to the bill, that's all. We have every right to be very proud of that bill, my boy. When all this land is sold to the state for parks, certain people are gonna make a lot of money, is that true? - Uh-huh. - Who are these people? - Friends... - Cold water, gentlemen? No, thank you, nothing at all. My dear Bo, when a man sells land or anything, doesn't he usually, usually expect a profit? And if some of that profit goes to our friends, people who have helped elect us, are we gonna stand in their way? Yes... if they get more than they should! You bet we are! What's the matter with you coming in here, practically attacking me, huh? I've just begin to realize it's me they call governor. Who's been talking to ya, Ronald? Well, why shouldn't he? Bo, we mustn't be at each other, we're friends, old friends, we've been like family, you gonna let the pious whimpering of that lieutenant governor come between us and our friendship? You and I have got a lot of things to straighten out, Sylvester. So, let's forget about Ronnie. In your present fram of mind, I don't see the sense in continuing this conversation. Did you think I'd never grow up? What do you want to know about that bill, huh? Where's the money coming from to pay our friends for the park? Taxes, of course! Taxes, you mean you want me to double-cross the people that voted for me, just so our rich friends can get richer? Let me explain to you why you'll sign this bill, my boy: I have complete control of the legislature. I, myself, have placed every committee man, every doorkeeper, every Usher, every pageboy I have indebted to me, tax collectors, local judges, policemen, firemen, the highest, and the lowliest official, my friends can disqualify any voter. I can pass 35 bills in two times 35 minutes. Well, I'll tell you one thing you haven't got, Sylvester, that's my right hand, and until it moves across the paper and spells out the name "Bo Gillis," that bill ain't law! Just a moment, please. - Mr. Marin? - Uh-huh? - Ronnie Hallerton is here. - Huh, ah, send him in. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Mr. Hallerton. - Hello, Sylvester. - Ah, come on in, my boy, make yourself at home, sit down. Thank you for being so prompt, ah, thank you. Time's precious, never waste it. That's a very good adage. Ronald, I want your advice about something. Shoot. I'd like to know what you think about our public parks bill. I can tell you that in a nutshell, Sylvester. I think it's an open and shut case of robbery. Do you? In fact, I've been doing some investigating, and I've discovered some things about that bill... Talking about discoveries, Ronald, it's come to my attention that you have a note outstanding for $90,000? I've had that for years, never missed a payment on the interest, though, not even during this depression. That's very commendable, Ronald, very commendable, but I'm told, I'm told the holder of that note can call it in any time he wants. You'd be in a disastrous position, Ronald. You'd lose your business, your plantation. The bank wouldn't do that. An old friend of mine bought up your notes, Ronald. He might have other ideas. Oh? So you've got nothing to worry about, my boy, nothing to worry about, I'll see that your credit's extended indefinitely. You will? If you do a little something for me? Just sign this. You uh... You expect me to resign? For the sake of your health, Ronald. I'll have to insist that you go away for a good, long rest. I see... I see how it is. - Good morning, Mr. Sylvester. - Good morning to you. Miss Ada's upstairs, I'll tell her you're here. don't worry, I'll announce myself. - Sylvester... - Miss Ada, forgive me taking the liberty of walking in on you like this, but it's urgent we have a few words alone. Is it something that can't wait until I get my clothes off? Purely academic indiscretion, I'm afraid, I'm quite an old man. Sylvester, it'll be at least 20 years before any woman can be completely safe with you. I'll admit it's a pleasure to look at you, miss Ada, a great pleasure. Well, then we both have good taste. You said there was something urgent? I want your help. The benefit of your intuitive understanding. Well, I think you know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you... Almost nothing... What's your problem? Heard about poor Ronald resigning, huh? Hadn't been well? Yes, I heard about that, that's too bad. Long time since I felt so depressed about it. It's depressed Bo even more. That's what you wanted to talk to me about, wasn't it? You're a very bright, young lady, miss Ada, very discerning eye, I don't know what's gone over Bo, it's not like him, he's suddenly, he's suddenly become willful, headstrong, even a little rude. Really? He won't listen to advice sometimes, he refuses even to talk to me. Oh, that isn't like him. I want to help him, miss Ada, as I have in the past, he needs my help, my guidance. You're the only person that can make him understand that. I appreciate your confidence in me, Sylvester. I'll do what I can. I knew you would, my dear. Have you any particular plan in mind? No, just to consult you and see if you have any suggestions. - I have several suggestions. - Uh-huh? First of all, I'd like you to get me something to do down at the capitol. You want to play a part in the affairs of state? A prominent part. What you ask is highly irregular, you know? Oh, no it isn't, Sylvester, times have changed. A woman would be accepted in public office now. What did you have in mind, huh? The office of lieutenant governor. You're an amazing woman, Ada, you aim high. Very high, I can handle that job, Sylvester, and besides, I'll be working with Bo and close to you... I'll talk to Bo for you, he'll listen to me. We'll look into it, there some sort of precedent, you know, ma Ferguson in Texas, we'll look into it. Well, there's nothing to look into, Sylvester. The appointment's up to the legislature... If you look in your pocket, that's where the legislature is. Well, never mind, William, I'll get it. Yes, ma'am. Hello, honey, you're home early. Hey, that makes you the first one who's been glad to see me today. Rough going, today? Well, Sylvester sure didn't waste any time passing the word. - The thing that gets me is... - No politics. You're home now... relax. The only subject under discussion is how would you like your drink, straight or with? Straight. If you feel as good as you look, you must feel great. I feel pretty good, the only trouble with me is I don't have enough to do. What are you talking about? The last few minutes alone, you've done more than your share. - Bo? - Mm? What would you think about my taking Ronnie's place? Your what? To my being lieutenant governor? You're kidding, aren't ya? No, I'm not kidding, now that job's open, why shouldn't I fill it? Well, come on, stop talking silly, honey. Well, give me one good reason! All right, I will... Because you don't know anything about politics, that's why. Well, I know as much about politics as you do. Well, if you know as much as I do, and I'm learning fast, then you know what a dirty, rotten business it is around here. Well, you're in it! Yes, up to my neck, now that I'm fighting Sylvester, which you asked me to do and I am doing, and Ada, this is gonna get rottener and dirtier. Look what happened to Ronnie, I don't want you mixed up in this, why should you be? Because I don't want to spend the rest of my life just sitting on the sidelines, I wanna be somebody. Well, you are somebody, you're my wife, now, when did that stop being enough for ya? Well, because I'm your wife, does that say I can't be anything else? Well, if you cared a damn about me, you wouldn't want to be anything else, most women don't. I don't know about most women, I just know about me. That's more than I do. Look, Bo, when we first met, I told you I wanted a hand up. Yes, but you didn't say how far you wanted to go. Just as far as I can go, why not? Now, we're talking about things that have nothing to do with the point, which is whether or not I'd be good in this job. don't you think I would be? I think you're smart enough to be anything you want, and you probably will, but not this time because I'm not gonna raise a finger to help you get the job. But you don't have to... Sylvester will. You talked to Sylvester about this? Well, then you're not asking me, you're telling me! I wanted to know how you'd feel about it. Well now you know, and I know Sylvester wouldn't have made you this offer if you hadn't made him think you could keep me in line! Would you rather he put one of his stooges in the job? He is putting one of his stooges in the job! That's not true! Look, Bo, we're gonna work together and we'll fight him together. A minute ago, it was all for ambition you wanted to do this, now it's all changed, now it's for me you're doing this! I didn't say that, what I said... Well, you better get straight on what you're saying and doing, Ada, you're talking out of both sides of your mouth and I won't have it! Bo, you're not making any sense, they're waiting. Well, this is one celebration I'm passing on. I know it's hard to take, but you've got no choice. There are reporters that want to ask you questions, photographers who want to take pictures. Steve, I just can't be nice to people when I don't believe in what they're saying or what they're doing. They are expecting you to witness the oath, you didn't do that! Well, I just couldn't! You're a public figure, so is Ada. Now, you must make an appearance if you want to stay in the fight. Okay, let's go. - Congratulations. - Thank you, so much. Oh, Sylvester, I don't know how I'm going to thank you. Merely the beginning, my dear, merely the beginning. - Congratulations, my dear. - Thank you, so much. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Good luck! - All right, take it easy, or the lieutenant governor's gonna run away. Miss Ada, one thing for sure, no state ever had a prettier executive, not one that smells so good. - Hello, governor. - How do you do, governor. Looks like I missed the main event. Oh, we understand perfectly, honey. The governor wanted this to be my very own, undivided, very special celebration. Governor, what about a statement for... Well, Bo? Oh, now, you heard the lady, this is her party. - Yeah, but just a few words? - No, no, thank you, thank you, let's go into Ada's conference room, shall we? We have a lot to discuss. Bo, we have something we have to clear up... Unimportant little misunderstandings. - Sit down, gentlemen. - Thank you. Yancey's joining us? If you have no objection? I like the benefit of the clear, uncomplicated mind he has, real, real political instinct, sit down, Yancey. Yes, his uniform always adds a tough of class to the room. Yeah, we're all a little self-conscious. That's because the hurt that each of us has felt can only be caused by someone we love. That's so true. It never occurred to me before, but what do you call a lieutenant governor, is it lieutenant or governor? Well, this woman'd very much like to be called "Ada." By everybody? I know that in spite of everything, deep down in his heart, Bo's very proud to have his lovely Ada share some of the duties of his high office, because it was very painful for all of us when Ronald resigned, but Ronald wasn't one of the team. You can't have a winning team with one man playing against you. You mind if I ask a question? Go on, go on, I want you to. What part do you play on this team? Well, I suppose I could be considered the coach, huh? Who calls some of the plays. Oh, I see that, I didn't know we were playing games. I was under the impression I was elected governor and by the people! Bo, do you really feel just because you're the governor that you no longer need help? You've suddenly become wise, experienced, erudite? No, sir... but I did learn a few things, Sylvester, one from you, that's how to talk soft and sweet before the knife goes in. Ho, ho, ho, my poor, young friend, how little you know. Have I ever asked anything of you? - Have I ever... - Yes! You asked me to sign the public parks bill, those crooked tax amendments, and a measure to protect the small homeowners. I know all about that "small homeowner," he owns 900 small homes. - Bo... - Oh, shut up! I'm not signing those bills, Sylvester. And what's more, I'm appointing a special man to look into the crooked goings on in the state house. You're a childish man, Bo... An ignorant, childish man. Come along, colonel, the conference is over. Just how far do you think you'll get handling Sylvester that way? He's got control in this state, Bo! You just can't roll over him like a freight train! Wait a minute, you look familiar, don't I know you? Oh, yes... it was in the back room of some hotel in the sticks wasn't it? - Bo... - don't "Bo" me! I know how to handle Sylvester and I know how to handle you. You got one talent, lieutenant, only one, and that's a talent that shouldn't be wasted. I'll call your driver sir! He's around the corner having a coke. Tell him I'm taking the car. Go in now, Mrs. Gillis, the governor's awake, and don't worry, he's going to be fine. I've been trying to see you, but... They wouldn't let me until now. They take right good care of a person in this hospital. Did the doctors say how soon you could come home? Home with you? I just ain't that brave, honey. It's tough luck I was sitting in the driver's seat when that bomb was put way back in the trunk. Boy, it'd be a cold day before you get another chance at me. You... you think I did it? I tried to kill you? You and Sylvester, together. Oh, no, no, Bo. Sorry, it's sorta crude coming right out with it, but a man gets a little mean and touchy when he's blown up sitting in his own car. Why would I try to do such a thing? don't have to be no genius to figure it out. Yesterday, yesterday afternoon when I... Got and gathered all the brains and guts I got together and declared war on Sylvester, you set a new speed record high-tailing it over to his side. No... it was the wrong way to fight him, that's all. Wasn't I the one who begged you to stand up to him? But that was before you sweet-talked him into making you lieutenant governor. You don't need me, nah, you're way up there all on your own. With me out of the way, there's nobody around to upset the gravy train. Only, I ain't out of the way. Three more weeks, the doctor said, so you'd better hurry up and make the most of it, you and Sylvester. There's not a chance you can be wrong, is there? Oh, Ada. I've been wrong about a lot of things. Once, in the back room of a saloon, somebody gave me a broad, as a present. I got to love her, and treated her with respect. And, I married her. I never once thought she'd turn on me, or kill me. That's just to prove to you how wrong I can be. Why don't you scream and yell, and say it ain't so? Why don't you tell me I'm out of my mind? It wouldn't mean much, would it? Coming from a broad... ...somebody gave you as a present... ...in the back room of a saloon. I don't think you believe me. I don't think I'd care. Ada. Oh, my dear girl, you look so tired... sit down. I wanted to be with you at the hospital but I just didn't have the strength. don't put on a black armband yet, Sylvester. You didn't kill him. You just came close. People say terrible things in moments of stress. I'm going to forget you ever said that. You did this to Bo, and you know it. Ada, I love that boy... I love him as though he were my own son. He may have been a little defiant of late, and I may have been sharp with him, I admit it, but that's a far cry from having him killed. Some crank did this to Bo, some crackpot. That's one of the hazards of public life. The thing that worries me... - Mr. Marin? - What? They're ready for Mrs. Gillis, now. Oh, yes, thank you. Ada, my dear. The supreme court has had an emergency session, since Bo is incapable of performing the duties of his office, you've automatically been declared acting governor. They're waiting to swear you in. What worries me, Ada, is your state of mind. These wild suspicions, these insane accusations. I don't know what got into me, Sylvester, I... I guess it was seeing Bo hurt, I... I wanted to lash out at something. I understand, my dear, completely. Come along. As far as taking Bo's place... Do you think I can handle the job? I have absolute faith in you, and myself. Together there'll be no stopping us. I'll do my best, Sylvester. I just hope my best is good enough for you. I, Ada Gillis, do solemnly swear... I, Ada Gillis, do solemnly swear... That I will uphold and defend the constitution, and the laws of this state. That I will uphold and defend the constitution, and the laws of this state. And, that I will faithfully perform all the duties encumbered upon me as governor... And, that I will faithfully perform all the duties encumbered upon me as governor... To the best of my ability, so help me God. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, governor. - Goodnight. Goodnight, my dear. Get some rest. I didn't know you were here. Why, I wouldn't miss this for anything. Tell me, governor, while you were being crowned queen of the may, did you spare just a little thought for my friend Bo? All my thoughts were on Bo. Oh, now, that's very touching. You know, I said to my friend Bo at the hospital, I said... "Bo, that girl cares for you." "She really cares for you." And he said, "that's funny..." "Because it was that little tramp who put me here." There's something else funny. The way you and Bo keep reminding me of what I was. Because what you can't forgive, either of you, is that I'm not that, anymore. Oh, please, governor. Let's not go into what you are now. I wouldn't want to throw up on your nice clean carpet. If you'll just accept this, let's bid each other a fond farewell. Best writing I've ever done... It's my resignation. You disappoint me, Steve. To resign now... just when I'm about to hit my stride? And you can watch my conniving and double-crossing, and double-dealing from close up? You're not as good a newspaper man as I thought you were. Why, think of the expose you could write. Why, there might even be a Pulitzer Prize in it, for you. Even a Pulitzer Prize can cost too much. Well, now, I hadn't realized you were that squeamish. Or, that high-principled. I thought watching dirty politics amused you. Otherwise, when your friend Bo was chosen as a candidate, you might have told him he was chosen as a stooge and nothing else. And when he was elected, you might have urged him to fight Sylvester and to throw the crooks out. And then, when he did start fighting, on his own, and floundering, you might have jumped into the fight with him, and helped him. But you didn't, did you? No. Come to think of it, outside of writing a few speeches, which he never delivered, and telling him I was a bad woman, which he knew, what have you ever done for your good friend Bo? Am I late, Kathleen? Yes, sir, you are... She begins right on time. Well, dockhelder, you make it around the course today under par? Oh, I am sorry I held things up, Mrs. Gillis. My doctor advised me to get some regular exercise. Well, I'm just what the doctor ordered. I'll keep you hopping, right here. All right, gentleman, let's get back to business. Mr. Ordman, you have an approval for $100,000 to build a road in Marisol county. Yes, it's badly needed, ma'am, uh... governor. Very badly needed. By who, Mr. Ordman? That road goes nowhere except to a piece of property you own. Well, I suggest you discuss this with Sylvester, ma'am. He's more familiar with the facts. Mr. Jackson, I have a report on my desk that says you condemned three truckloads of food scheduled for the old people's home. Two days later, that same food showed up in a chain of markets, of which you are part owner. I consider that a little bit shifty. So, Mr. Jackson, you're going to have to find some other way of storing up nuts for the winter. I suggest that, perhaps, if we were... Well, gentleman, I could go on, but I think you get the drift. If you don't, you're gonna be the saddest sight in the whole world... Unemployed politicians. Well, uh, I'm sure you'll have our very best efforts, Mrs. Gillis. That, or your hides. You sure do come right to the point, don't you, Mrs. Gillis? You don't sugarcoat the pill any. Oh, I don't know Mr. Jackson... I'm wearing a silk petticoat and French perfume. We noticed. You've got a reputation for having a sharp eye, Mr. De Paul. Keep it on your budget appropriation, from now on. Oh, uh, give our best to the governor, when you see him. You're talking to the governor. Thank you. I'm all right, I'm all right, thank you... I can manage. Come in, come in! Good afternoon. - Sylvester? - Ada? Nurse, put those in water while they're still fresh. Very courteous of you, Ada, to come all this way to talk to me. I wouldn't have asked you, except for this little illness. The, uh, the leaf grows seared and yellow, you know. I think there's some life left in you, yet. My butterflies, aren't they beautiful? But boy, you adore me, come and sit down. Ada? I hesitate to discuss business so soon after near tragedy, but, uh, the matter of running the government continues to be our responsibility. I've been told... I've been told that you handled one or two of our associates a little bit roughly the other day. Oh? Very good idea to make them toe the mark from time to time. Like most people, they're inclined to greed occasionally, but I want to reassure you that every one of them boys would bend over backwards to support you. Well now, I'm glad to hear that, Sylvester. It'll make the changes I have in mind so much simpler to push through. What changes are you referring to, huh? Well, first of all, the budget. I'm gonna cut it, right down the middle. Now, before you do that, I suggest you examine the financial reports. You'll find the budget is worked out with great care. I'm sure it has, by your friends who bought all that cheap land and are now about to sell to the state. Bo wouldn't like that. I never pictured you as a loyal wife, before. I guess I'm beginning to make mistakes. Never put your trust in a woman, Sylvester. Any man will tell you that. It appears I've been hoodwinked. I really did expect your cooperation, you know. Let me fill you in on a few of my other ideas. Next week, in the legislature, I'm gonna propose the elimination of the special tax exemption on all private hospitals with over 200 beds. That'll only affect one hospital in this state... St. Anne's, owned by Dr. striker Smith. I'm also gonna see to it that we don't award a single government contract for state printing, anymore. That'll take more than a million dollars a year away from the Donford printing company. And, the other little item I have in mind involves a separation tax on all canneries exporting over 300,000 pounds of canned seafood a year. The only one that bill will hurt, and hurt bad, is Mr. Richard Bradfeld. Tea? These men have opened their personal fortunes to me, they've supported my career. You better start thinking about retiring, soon. Retiring... Not yet, miss. I rather enjoy a good fight. And you're gonna get it. Nurse, nurse... Come here. May I have that again, please? Oh, just a moment. I have a personal call on the line, governor. Well, I don't want to talk to anyone, right now. It's a Mrs. sweet. She says she's an old friend. - Who? - A Mrs. Alice sweet? Did she say what she wants? No, just that it was important. Would you like me to say you're out? No, I'll talk to her. Hello? Oh, hello, Alice, how are you? I'd rather not tell you on the phone, Ada, but there's trouble... Bad trouble. I think you aughta consider paying me a visit. Trouble... bad trouble? Yes, I'm at a little motel outside of town on the highway. It's called haven's inn and I'm in cabin number ten. Come on... Oh, Ada. Sit down over there. Imagine me, being called on by the governor. What's the trouble, Alice? Oh, well, I'm not feeling well... not a bit well, honey. You know, I think I got a kidney stone. Now, you aughta do something about that. Oh, well, I plan to. As soon as I can land my hands on some real money for the operation. My goodness, little lady, you rose to the top like cream in a milk bottle. All right, let's stop all the small talk, Alice. Aw, now say, you're not gonna be as hard to do business with as that Yancey fellow, though, are ya? And, you know I haven't come to any terms with him, yet. I just can't stand a man who pinches pennies, can you? Just about as much as a woman who tries to extort them. Listen, I've considered I've always been a good friend to you. Now, I'm giving you a chance to make some kind of an arrangement. How much did he offer you? $5,000 if I can come up with some proof that'll hold up and I got some proof that'll hold up real fine. - I'll give you $10,000. - Oh, that'll be fine. It's gonna take me a little while to get that money together. - How long? - A few days. Oh, well, that'll be all right. I don't want you to think I'm inconsiderate. Well, you can't blame me, now can you? Look, I got back aches all the time and I'm alone, and... You're all signed up, you ready? Raring to go. Well, you sound like a man with a plan. I wanna go on the air, Steve, and tell the people of this state the whole score. After that, I don't care if they throw rocks at me or toss me in the pokey, just as long as I take Sylvester with me. - Did she move out, like I said? - No, not yet. She's still the governor until you return. Okay, I've returned. She's over at the state house right now, sponsoring three new bills. If they're passed, that's the end of Sylvester. They won't pass, huh? What's the matter with you, boy, don't you recognize an act when you see one? One last word, gentleman. Now, you're here on that floor today that I've used you in my office to revenge myself on personal enemies. That's not the issue. It's true this bill is designed to cause these three gentlemen some discomfort, but for one reason and for one reason only. They have sheared this state like a sheep. Sylvester Marin can get pretty mean when he's cornered. Well, you're not afraid of him, are you? No, miss Ada, but that old fox will be gunning for all of us after this. Well, I'm expecting that you'll bring me back his bushy tail. Now, I'd like to thank you. I know I've kept you away from your families while we've gone over this ground. No complaints on that skull, miss Ada. I hope we've become good friends in this time. If I had any more friends that looked like you, my wife would turn me out of the house. We'll do our very best, ma'am. Morning, ma'am. Uh, you're gonna need a lot of help this morning. Uh... Alice sweet and you had a conversation and I've got it right here in my briefcase. Besides, which, the old lady had a lot of things to say on her own. Of course, this didn't come as a surprise to me, see, I've always had a feeling... I know what kind of feelings you have. Now, you don't want to talk to me like that, ma'am. I want to be your friend. Your real close friend. You know why? Because you're different. I've watched you go right to the top. I've never known anybody that's a powerhouse like you, and pretty, and all woman at the same time. That's got to make a man real excited. You don't even like me a little bit, do ya? Well, that's all right... I don't mind. Sometimes it's better that way. Now, I've got this conversation between you and miss sweet, right here, I'll just... Oh, no. Now, I'm just gonna let you ask me. Ask me not to give this to Sylvester. Real sweet, like. And, I'm sure the words, coming from your pretty lips, will persuade me. How 'bout it? don't you want to say please? Pretty please? Tamblyn, Templeton, Tonberg, turtle... Warren, Wagner, Walker, Webson, Whalen, Winslow... Witters, Ureszsch... Forum is present, the house will be in order. Each member will take a seat. Heavenly father, we ask thy blessings on this August body. We pray for these, our lawmakers, that they may be given the wisdom for every decision. Be with them in their deliberations, that they may be pleased in thy sight. Amen. Thank you, Babylon. The hour of ten having arrived, special order of business set for this time is consideration of house bills 2130, 2131, and 2132. Which is a special tax on canneries bill, a tax exemption for private hospitals bill, the state printing contract bill. First order on file is house bill 2130. Clerk will read. House bill number 2130, an act to provide for a separation tax on cannery. Mr. speaker... Mr. speaker! Chair recognizes Mr. Joe Adams. Mr. speaker, members of this house, I am of course in favor of this measure. And, I say that anyone who withholds his support of the governor on these measures, is no true friend of this state. We have had secret boss kind of government long enough in these parts. And, Mr. speaker, I am referring to a man who holds no office from the people, but who is well known to all of us... Sylvester Marin. Sylvester Marin... Adams, you're out of order. A point of personal privilege here, Mr. speaker. Chair recognizes Mr. Natfield. - Mr. speaker... - You are out of order! Gentlemen, the house will be in order. Now, we will transact no further business until all of the members take their seats. In order, gentlemen, in order. Mr. Warren Natfield. Mr. speaker, I have been... Mr. Adams your time has expired! As you know, you will have a further opportunity in your closing. - Now, Mr. Natfield. - Thank you. Mr. speaker, fellow members, this bill is vicious, it's dangerous and it's utterly without merit. We condemn any tax bill that seeks to impose a heavy tax burden on the great industries of this state. Are we gonna bankrupt as fine a citizen as Richard Bradville, to satisfy the petty vanity of that woman? - No, Mr. Natfield. - Increase the sales tax two percent, so they can relieve the big boys at the top and sweat it out of the little boys at the bottom. - I beg your pardon, Mr. Davis... - I am speaking, and I am not yielding. Now, gentlemen, gentlemen, this will not do. Gentlemen, I am going to tell you what will happen if you don't pass this bill. You will have a sales tax that will be the most tyrannical form of taxation ever introduced. Will you please come to order? They want this administration run by a bunch of ladies in waiting to our majesty, up there. That doesn't buy a bunch of bootleggers, sir. - Gentlemen, please. - My distinctive supporters are jumping up and down like a lot of fleas. Fleas have a use... They keep the dog awake. Well, we are gonna proceed according to the rules. Now, please, gentlemen. Gentlemen, not one of you shall shout me down. Mr. winters. Mr. speaker, I move the previous question. No, sir... no! A sufficient number having arisen, the previous question is ordered. Mr. speaker, by this motion and your ruling, sir, you have deliberately enabled the Sylvester Marin crowd to stifle any further debate. Under our rules and by your own testimony, you have said yourself that I am entitled to close this discussion. Very well, Mr. Adams, you may make your closing argument. All right, we should proceed with a vote. But, before you vote, gentlemen... Miss Ada has asked me to remind you of one thing: These measures are part of a program of reform started by Bo Gillis, whom the people, not Sylvester Marin, elected governor of this state. A vote for these bills is a vote for the governor. Roll call... Roll call! All debate having finished, the clerk will prepare the roll. All the members will please vote. I voted 'yes' but it shows red. I haven't even voted yet and... And my light's red. They got something wrong, so is mine. Make 'em change my vote! That chairman team is fixed, Mr. speaker, it's fixed! The party's been tampering with our voting machines! All the members having voted, the clerk will please clear the roll. Roll call, I-34. Mr. speaker! Chair recognizes Mr. Ordman. I move to adjourn. Gentlemen, please. Twice roll call... twice roll call... twice roll call! Very well... Clerk, we'll call the roll. - Adams? - Aye. Adams, aye... Adkins? - Aye. - Adkins aye... Brownson? - No. - Brownson, no... Campbell? - No. - Campbell, no... Carfan, no. - Aye. - Carfan, no, aye... De Paul. - No. - De Paul, no... Dickson? - Aye. - Dickson, aye... dockhelder? - No. - Dockhelder, no... Enach? - No. - Enach, no... Fairman? - Aye. - Fairman, aye... Gibson? - Aye. - Gibson, aye... Offman? - Aye. - Offman, aye... Jackson? - Aye. - Jackson, aye... Kingsby? - Aye. - Kingsby, are... Launder? - Aye. - Launder, aye... Mann? - Aye. - Mann, aye... Mitchell? - Aye. - Mitchell, aye... Morgan? - Aye. - Morgan, aye... Murphy? - Aye. - Muphy, aye... Natfield? - No. - Natfield, no... Newman? - No. - Newman, no... Neilson? - No. - Neilson, no... Nolan? - Aye. - Nolan, aye... Norbet? - Aye. - Norbet, aye... Ordman? - No. - Ordman, no... Pilkinton? - No. - Pilkinton, no... priestly? - Aye. - Priestly, aye... Just a moment, Mr. clerk. Mr. natfield, for what purpose do you arise? I have important information here for my colleagues. Point of order, Mr. speaker, we're in the middle of a roll call. Please instruct Mr. natfield to be seated. No, my colleagues have a right to know who sponsored these bills before they vote on them. The acting governor of this state is sponsoring these bills. And what was she before she became acting governor? A common trollop, that's what she was. A woman who could be bought by anyone! There are tapes to prove it. Gentlemen, gentlemen... Gentlemen, I don't have to speak... On this recording the lady speaks for herself. And she hangs herself... In one minute, you can hear our acting governor offer her former madam $10,000 just to keep her mouth shut about the past. She's willing to pay $10,000 to keep you in ignorance... And that's the woman who gives you your orders! Mr. speaker... Mr. speaker! Mr. speaker... Mr. speaker! Sylvester Marin gives you your orders Mr. natfield. A man who sells out all the people of this state for money! You like that better? You have no official position here! You have no right to speak! If a man's wife is accused, most people would say he has a right to defend her. - Is that right? - Yeah! He's out of order, Mr. speaker... Throw him out of here! Throw him out! Order... order... order! I'm your elected governor... Handpicked by Sylvester Marin... Why? What qualifications did I have? Well, I like people... I talk to 'em plain and I play the guitar. Well, that added up to being a good vote getter, I guess. Too dumb even to see what was going on, let alone ask questions. A man you could count on to sign any bill without even reading it... Just as long as Sylvester Marin said sign, well, that's what I did. But, I'm not here to tell you I'm more innocent than he is, or that my hands are cleaner. There's just one thing that Sylvester didn't know. That I was grateful to the people who voted for me... Who raised me up higher than I ever dreamed. I didn't want to do them any harm, so I started reading the bills I was signing, and asking questions. That's when I found out that Sylvester Marin and his friends were robbing this state blind. That's when I served notice that I was gonna try and be a governor, not a stooge. Six hours later, a bomb was put in my car. But my wife went on fighting for me. Believing that there are honest men among you and finding 'em. So, now you've planted another bomb, haven't you, Sylvester? Only this was to take your minds off the bills we're asking you to pass. Now, you can do what you want to me... Ask me to resign, throw me out and prosecute me. First, vote on these bills... Pass 'em. Make the first move in freeing this state from graft and corruption. And fools like me. My feelings are hurt. That's the best speech you ever made and I didn't even write it. Order! Mr. speaker... Mr. speaker we are in the middle of a most important roll call vote. Clerk will continue with the roll call vote. - Pamperly? - Aye. - Pamperly, aye... Peterson? - Aye! Sylvester, just a minute. When they start investigating, what are you gonna do about it? Just a minute, miss. Ah, hell to 'em... I'm prepared to meet a more severe judge than any they got in their courts. Yeah, but what about me? What are you gonna do about me? I ain't old and sick. Yancey... I suggest you go out and get yourself drunk. Have a night on the town. It may be your last opportunity for some time. I don't want those pills, come on... Come on... come on, then. - Push me, take me home. - Yes sir, yes sir. Congratulations, Mr. Adams... You did a fine job, sir. I really appreciate you standing up to that bunch. Thank you. Now that these three bills have passed, what's next Mr. Adams? This is just the first step in a reform program that'll take the government of this state back to the people.
