On the bell. Going on the bell. - It's going to hit 6. - What'd we say here CBG? I want to sell those between 44 to 50 dollars. Everyone here is losing money. Our customers are losing money. I'd say that this is most like 1973, 1974 today. And that would be for 18 months. I've been here for thirty years. In 87, when the market crashed, we went down and it was quick. This has been a continuing grind. Currently, the stock trading is very irrational. Stop stock trading. Protest against irrational trading. In order to tackle the economic recession, the government summons heads of financial services for a meeting. How can you have a constitutional democratic government when in fact, one percent owns most of the wealth? How did that happen? We need a new financial system. - New System! - New System! - Another world is possible. - New System! - New System! - New System! The Sandbox Bill is a big leap for us. It signifies that the Ministry of Financial Service is freed from the burden of the past and to undergo a total transformation. Therefore, this time we'll choose the team with the grandest vision to join the Sandbox. Also, we'll invite the international venture capital to participate in this open and fair selection. Let's get rid of all legal restrictions and carry out a daring experiment. Let Taiwan be the leader of the financial technology. Minister, is there any restriction on the candidates? No. We hope that everyone will take part in the project. Minister, you came back from abroad for this post Do you have any other plan for your career in politics? Will you run for the Taipei Mayor next year? For now, I just want to help the government relax the financial regulations. Apart from this, we'll see what happens in the future. Minister, what's your next move? Will you run for the Taipei Mayor? -Thank you all -Minister. That's all we got time for. Thank you all. - Thanks. - Minister. MINISTRY OF FINANCIAL SERVICE This is a beautiful world. A world controlled by money. Five years ago, I was the youngest bank branch manager. The branch had a monthly turnover of 100 million. But I was paid less than 70,000 a month. I was confused. Why was my salary so out of proportion with my performance? In this world controlled by money, some people make money with money. Without putting in any real work, they've made billions of dollars. So I decide to take up a challenge and will not regret it even if I fail. I'll build a transparent cash flow mechanism with new technology to fight injustice. And now we've got the chance to realize this dream. As long as you guys are willing to believe in me. As long as you're willing to believe in me... I'm willing to believe in you. But look at how you changed our pitch, will the investors understand it? Look. What do we do when we get a Rubik's Cube? We adopt a formula to solve it. But those who make the cubes don't care about it. They only care about how to make it harder and sell it to more people. That's why we can never convince any investors. Why? Look. Since we set up the company, we've won countless prizes. We even have a genius who turned down Berkeley. But why? Why? Why can't we find any investors? It's because we only care about how to improve our skills but ignore the most important thing. Hm? The investors want a big factory. Not this. That's right. But what we're building is a blockchain ecosystem fighting against Capitalism. If we grow big overnight, we'll be sent to jail. But what if we apply to join the Sandbox? If we succeed, the world will change because of us. What a waste. It's not a waste. The only cask of 45-year-old Macallan left in the world. You bought it. But instead of collecting it, you pour it away. If it's not a waste, what is it? I'm increasing its value. You get 200 bottles out of the cask. A bottle could fetch 2 million. If there is only one bottle, the one and only bottle, that no one has ever tasted in the world, who will be able to evaluate it? You smell it? What? The fragrance of money. What's this? A cask of good whisky. A cask of good whisky that belongs to a new era. But it has to be wood-finished to meet my needs. Nowadays, we spend the most precious time in our lives on turning ourselves into gears that can be replaced. During the process, we lost our uniqueness without knowing it. There is only one purpose to keep the gears working every day and it is to keep a monster called "money" alive. This monster swallows the total value of our work and stops the people and the government making real money. Instead, we're enslaved by money. But now I've got a chance. A chance to change everything before our eyes. Through blockchain, the new generation of internet, we can overturn everything and seize the power and the control back from the monster. This is why I come to apply for participating in the Sandbox, seeking financial support. SELF TOKEN, a currency that belongs to us. Through the transparency of the blockchain, we can create the first cryptocurrency used in different countries. In that case, we won't need to rely on the banks, the securities firms, the insurance companies or any of these dishonest centralized organizations. People can work directly with the government. Everyone can become part of the currency. I believe that it'll free us from the shackle of money. I believe that it'll make us retrieve the basic value of humans. - I believe that it'll help us... - Have you ever thought how this cash flow system could stop money laundering and protect personal data in the process of globalization? Moreover, how can the government in each country tax the so-called blockchain and how to protect everyone's right? - Okay, I think... - If I lose my money, how can I get it back? Don't those who have no internet access deserve to be rich? It's good to have a dream. But don't use this as a platform to deliver your speech. We need thoughts that can be realized. Tzu hsiang. - Yin Tzu hsiang, right? - Yes. You've got a great idea. But just like what Ms. Hsu said, there are many problems that need to be overcome in this proposal. I hope you can keep working hard. Okay? Yes. Thanks. Well done. Thanks. Next. It's never easy to run a start-up. But high risk, high return. I believe that after you amend your proposal and get selected for the Sandbox, you'll make a huge profit out of the patents and the shares you mortgaged. Come. It's a pleasure working with you. Don't worry. Convertible bonds are reliable. You have faith in the company? Yes. Good. Very good. Your partners will be grateful to you. AFTER HEARING YOUR PITCH, I'M INTERESTED. TIME FOR A DRINK? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Tomorrow's my dad's birthday. I need to go home. Would you like to come with me? I don't want to borrow money from your dad. What if we don't call it "borrowing" but an investment my dad puts in? Instead of allowing others to make money, why not my dad? I don't want your dad to look down on me. But don't worry. I'll find a way. 21:00 TOMORROW NO. 39 LELI RD. SELF BAR Are you on your own? What do you do? I run a blockchain start-up. What is blockchain? When the subprime mortgage crisis happened in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed the idea of Bitcoin. From there emerged the blockchain decentralization technology. In short, it's a trick to con you out of money... Look at how the value of bitcoin fluctuates. How can we use it? What does it have anything to do with us? It has a lot to do with us. It's not only the next generation of internet but a mechanism that conveys value. What's the next generation of internet? You're not explaining anything. Can you let me finish? Then you'll know that the blockchain technology... Actually, blockchain is quite simple. For example, I put some money into the bank. Theoretically speaking, the bank should safeguard my money. But the bank often secretly lends my money to others such as property developers to make a profit. When the property developers make money, they pay the government taxes and the bank the money borrowed with interest. Now let me ask you where do you think your money is? In the bank? If we go to the bank and ask them to open the vault, we'll find that in fact, there isn't that much money in there. I know. In the government. Every government in the world is in debt. The total debt is up to 16.4 trillion US dollars. So do the property developers get all the money? Wrong. You'll see only a pretty bubble. The so-called high property prices are just an illusion. So where did the money go? As long as I've got these opaque cups in my hands, I can secretly get all the money from you. Back to your start-up company. What on earth is blockchain? It's like changing these opaque cups into transparent ones. So you'll always know where your money is. The money always belongs to you. It won't be stolen by others. Right? What are you taking? Adderall. Smart drugs. To be precise, it's a stimulant used to treat the ADHD. But it's illegal, right? As long as you have power, nothing is illegal. You publicly humiliated me on the stage. Why do you want to see me? I humiliated you because I don't like sharing with others. Only when they give up on you can we work together. Right? Why should I work with you? My father was a high-ranking bank manager. Back then the Taiwanese economy was booming. Taiwan stock index reached over 10,000. In order to go international and to reward the senior staff, the bank came up with a project. Within the bank, they offered the high-ranking staff a company bond with a 20% annual interest. 20% is really high. My father lent 300 million to the bank. It included money he borrowed from his boss, his friends and the cooperatives. Later the authorities discovered the misconduct of the bank. The bank went bust overnight. My father jumped to his death. The creditors drove my mother mad. And I... stayed with one relative after another. In a few years, I moved more than thirty times. I lost a lot of things in my life that can never be retrieved. The boss back then was jailed for only a year. He's still manipulating the society with his power. What did you lose? It's not important. Then what's important? That's why I want to work on blockchain with you because I hate this centralized world and this unfair capital society. I want to create the new world you described with you. Okay. Then how should we start? Like me. Learn how to tell an enchanting story first. Work with me. I guarantee that you'll be selected for the Sandbox. I can give you any investment needed and a good story. What do you think of it? Are you interested? I don't agree. I bet there is something fishy about them. You mean Hsu Ching or the Sandbox? Hsu Ching sounds fishy. So does the Sandbox. How can they guarantee that? - Anyway, I don't trust her. - Are you thinking too much? This is how the world works. If you've got contacts, you've got everything. If you don't, you've got nothing. Finally, we've got the chance. We should take it. How about our original intention? Our self-respect? Can you live on those things? Apart from writing the codes, have you cared about other things? Do you know how much we pay for the rent, the phone and the broadband? You know Chen Hsi pays what you drink and eat out of her own pocket? And then? You naively think you can live on your self-respect? - But, it's not... - Enough. - We need money. - Enough. - We can't do anything without money. - Enough. Fine, let's vote. It's the fairest way. Okay, let's vote. I agree to Hsu Ching's proposal. I'm against it. Hsi, how about you? You're the biggest shareholder. Yi. I know you don't trust Hsu Ching. You don't trust the Sandbox either. But are you willing to trust me? In God we trust. It doesn't matter if you want to make money or issue a currency or print banknotes, all the secrets about money boil down to this saying. As for how to do it... It's clearly written in this book. Religion is the most successful business in the world. Use religion to make people donate. Use an idol to unite people. What you need to do is become the saint worshipped by people in the new world. Don't I look too young in this? Isn't it your advantage? - Okay. - Hey. - Where are you going? - To change back to my clothes. No need. From now on till the Sandbox is passed, you'll keep wearing it. This is the last thing that needs to be sorted. Good day, ma'am. Manager, long time no see. Long time no see. This is Yin Tzu hsiang, the founder of SELF TOKEN. Hello. Mr. Yin. This is your company card.. All your travel and accommodation expenses will be free from now on. Free? No need to be surprised. Nowadays, the richer you are, the less you have to pay since money flows up to the top of society. Welcome to our new office. Everything you see before your eyes is free. You see it? All free. We made the right choice. I've never seen the clothes you're wearing, have I? I chose it. Hope you don't mind. Thanks. If he doesn't mind, I wouldn't mind either. I'm Chen. The top blockchain engineer at the Sichieh Fund. Hello, I'm... Actually, I don't think you're good enough to be my bosses. Finish it. How could it be possible? Only three lines? Impossible. Of course it is. In the blockchain structure we're developing, we don't charge any transaction fee. After all, he's a genius. It's not shameful to be beaten by a genius. You got it? I'll teach you later. Is it necessary? Have you seen any herowith glasses on? But I've never worn them. Here, look at me. Close your eyes and move your eyeballs. Are you ready? Yeah. Up you go. Hello everyone. My name is Yin Tzu hsiang. I'm the founder of SELF. I've been wondering whether you're coming for drinks or for my speech? I guess it's for drinks. But before I begin my speech, I want to ask you a question. Did you have pocket money when you were young? - Yes. - Yes. All of you? I didn't have any pocket money. My best friend Dai Yi... He didn't have pocket money either. So together we thought of a way to make money. With his incredibly smart brain, we did the math homework that everyone hated most for our classmates. Smart. You nervous? I'm okay. Have a guess. On the first day, how much did we make? - 200. - 500. - 400. - We charged 50 dollars each. We had 20 customers. In total, we earned 1,000 dollars. It's true. For one thousand dollars, we worked for three days without resting. Even sacrificed the most precious time for playing video games. So we made a decision. Only 10 customers a week. So we earned 500 dollars. Just enough for playing games in an internet cafe and have noodles with egg. But you know what happened later? More expensive. What did you say? I said more expensive. What's become more expensive? The service is in high demand so the price is raised reasonably. That's right. Just like what she said. It became more expensive. By the end of the term, we charged 1,000 dollars for one customer. Thank you, Dai Yi. The Sandbox project is our top priority at the moment. No matter what, we have to make all the amendments before the next review and get selected for the Sandbox. This is an anecdote of our childhood. But in reality, if Maroon 5 is having a concert with 1,000 tickets, 10,000 people fight over them, can you tell me if Maroon 5 would earn more than originally expected? No. The online ticketing system would crash. The ticket scalpers would get all the tickets. But the fans who truly love Maroon 5 would fail to get any tickets. They have to pay the middlemen who snatch the tickets more. Why do you think it would happen like this? The ticketing system isn't good enough. True, the system isn't good enough. But is there a more fundamental problem? Because they didn't come to me. I mean it. If I was the middleman for Maroon 5, I'd want the fans who truly love Maroon 5 to have the privilege to buy tickets first. But this is what most middlemen fail to do. Why? Because they're selfish. But what if I could build a smart contract on blockchain which would allow everyone here to become a middleman? Let one's selfishness become profit for everyone. No need to let the dishonest bankers or the incompetent government be the middlemen and steal our wealth. Everyone, do you think it's a good idea? - Yes. - Yes. Yes. A very charming speaker, isn't he? I prefer what he was like before. You're missing something in the past. Isn't there anything in the past you miss? No. I feel sorry for you. Tell me. The first man who ate a crab... How hungry was he that he'd eat something like this? As long as you're hungry, you'd eat anything even if it's poisonous, right? All going well? Everything is going as planned. But I can only promise that we'll raise three billion in the end. I can't make the bank verify it. As long as they're one of us, all the transactions are just numbers they put in, right? Are you angry? No. Honestly? Yes. Do you like Hsu Ching? No. But I can accept her. What do you mean? Because she can help you. Thank you. Happy Valentine's Day. What's this? The Love Token I invented for you. A symbol of everlasting love. Since it's been put on blockchain, it'll never be changed. And then? You can exchange it for anything I can do. Okay. You said it. In short, we amend the overall payment method and concentrate on the live app development. More importantly, we'll carry out the KYC procedure and work with the auditors. Hope our innovation would create a win-win situation for the people and the government. Impressive. You improved so much in a month. You filled in all the gaps we mentioned. I have to thank Ms. Hsu. If it weren't for her advice, we wouldn't be able to make such amendments. Good. Please wait outside. When we hear all the proposals, we'll announce the winner straightaway. Don't be nervous. It's just a procedure. Why did you choose usin the first place? To make money. But you can make money in other businesses. If I can make money and at the same time, turn the world into a better place, isn't it good? You're lying to me again. Have you got any friends you can be honest with? I don't need any. Yes, we all do. If the bill is passed, I'm willing to be the first friend you can be honest with. Minister. Congratulations. You're the only team unanimously selected. Let's carry out the project together. Are you confident? Yes. Very good. Just call me Mike. Thank you, minister. Congratulations. Scissors, paper, stone. What do you think? It tastes nice, yeah? Very nice. This is the best Japanese A5 Wagyu beef. It's not easy to get. You must have contacts to import it through a special channel. Actually, I always feel that you need to choose the right red wine to make the beef taste nice. Just like people. You must be with the right person to have a happy life together. To be honest, I always thought that you were a restructured steak. I didn't expect that you turn out to be the Wagyu beef. Dad. What? Did I say anything wrong? I'm just being honest. The thing you're doing... Blockchain. Isn't it about the trust between people? Yes. Blockchain is all about mutual trust. It's just that I don't deserve to be described as the Wagyu beef. After all, I come from a humble background. If we get a chance, let me cook you American beef. Actually, the premium ribeye smells really nice. Sure. I look forward to it. Everything is going well. All we need is his signature tomorrow. THE TRUSTEE IS ENTITLED TO 15% OF THE AMOUNT SELF TOKEN RAISES AS COMMISSION What's this? It's a procedure we have to go through before the press conference held in three days. A procedure to go through? Yeah. All the new companies in the Sandbox have to set up a trust with the Shin Hsin Financial. Moreover, we'll audit it in order to control the risk. I'm thinking about the collaboration... - If it's okay... - It's okay. Hsu Ching. Did you know all these before? Hello. Gordon Kao of Shin Hsin Financial. Shin Hsin Financial is helping the new company in the Sandbox. It's different from what we agreed. Excuse me. Mikey. Gordon. Good to see you, man. - It's been a while. - Long time no see. Set up a trust with the bank and they can stop the cash flow at any time. Tell me. Am I doing blockchain or running a branch of theirs? How can you make money if you don't get into the system? Make money? Damn, you think it's the only thing everyone wants? My dream is to create a new world. Not to be a puppet for these people. Everyone has a role to play in the world. Your role happens to be a puppet. You'll regret it. It's you who will regret it. I don't think you'll get your investment back. I'll lose only a dozen millions out of billions. But what you lose is your bright future. You're wrong. What I lose is those virtual numbers. But I keep my integrity. It seems that after all, Ms. Hsu has failed to sort everything out. SELF TOKEN LT. CO. TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON THE FIRST CONVERTIBLE BONDS IN TAIWAN Come on. Time is money. Let's start the meeting. Ladies first. Okay. I know. Give me some more time. I told you that we couldn't trust them. Enough. Apart from you, who could have expected them to be so evil. You can't do this. What we agreed is... Hello? Don't you think you're being too impulsive? What are you talking about? We can leave just like this. It's fine. But how about those outside? What will happen to them? You get this right. They're Hsu Ching's employees. Not ours. They work for us. They help us realize our dream. Don't they? You have to make a choice between reality and dream. You let more than a hundred employees watch us... Nick. What's up? I'm fine. I just want you to know, - now that we... - Nick. Among those outside, can you tell who are helping Hsu Ching and who are helping us? Is it important? The point is that you're damn talented. You're damn smart. And now we've got a great platform. We can move forward. But because of your meaningless self-respect, you want to give it up. Dreams cannot be so simple. It cannot be so pure. Dreams have to be compromised. If you don't get your hands dirty, how can you realize your dream? What did you do? I did nothing. Seriously? If you care so much about whether your dream is pure and flawless, you should have borrowed money from her dad. Actually, I've thought it through. I think Dai Yi has thought it through too. Hsi has already got the old office ready. If you need to calm down and think, you could stay here. Tzu hsiang. Nick. I really don't think it should end like this. Tzu hsiang. I'm sorry. I really didn't expect that things would end up like this. Hope you and Yi could forgive me. I thought it'd give us a better future. If we could start all over again, I wouldn't do something like this in secret. I'm sorry. I sold our dreams, your self-respect and future. I'm sorry. Nick. Nick. What are you doing? Get down. Please, get down. I'm sorry. No need to say sorry. Nothing is impossible. I turned all the shares into a convertible bond. I even mortgaged my family's property. Now Shin Hsin owns everything. I'll raise money to buy it back. Okay? It won't work. Believe me. It's over. No, we'll think of something. Okay? - Get down please. - Yin Tzu hsiang. I'm sorry. I don't want to listen to you. You get... Nick. Grand Master. A pawn threw himself off a building. Any problem? No problem. When we setup the convertible bond, we took everything into account. So even if he has died, we still own the company. It's a pleasure working with you. Don't worry. Convertible bonds are reliable. That's good. The patient's neck and sphenoid bone are seriously injured. Though he's in a stable condition, his brain lost a lot of blood. He's likely to be in a coma for a long time or even a vegetative state. You should have signed the contract. Should I? So your dream is more important? No. I just feel it's so unfair. What's unfair? Why the world is controlled by people like you? Nick himself signed the convertible bond. Didn't he? Often we remember blaming others but forget to examine ourselves. If you don't work with us, Nick won't be the last to jump off a building. You get it? Now I'm reporting from the Sandbox press conference. The Minister of Financial Service will hold the ceremony with the new company selected for the Sandbox. Your call will be transferred... Yi. Did Tzu hsiang contact you? No. Today I happily announce that... Hsi. SELF TOKEN has become the first successful example of the Sandbox Project. It'll allow us to become the first blockchain island in the world. - Tzu hsiang. - Now let's welcome Mr. Yin Tzu hsiang to initiate the project with us. 3, 2, 1. Mr. Yin, are you satisfied with the result? What is your next step? Do you plan to expand it abroad? Your CFO jumped off a building. Is it related to the Sandbox? Did you visit the CFO's family? Keep going. You're quiet because you don't dare to face it? - Anything you can't tell us? - Please answer us. Yi. Why? The reason is? For everyone's sake. For everyone's sake. What? What? Yin Tzu hsiang. Can you explain it properly to us? Didn't we reach an agreement yesterday? But you didn't know that Nick signed a convertible bond with Shin Hsin. Even if we don't take part in the Sandbox, they still own the company. And then? Since the result is the same, why don't we stay here and work hard? At least, we can afford Nick's medical care and accomplish something. Isn't it good? It's an excuse. Yi. It's time we take responsibility. Yi. Let him go. Yin Tzu hsiang. Or you want to leave too? If you don't, stay and work with me. Let's continue. Boss. The Coin Market Cap called and asked if you have time to go to the blockchain summit in LA next week. Check my schedule with Tom. If it's okay, we'll go. Alright. Tina, Jeff, is it done? Yes, it's done. It went very well. We solved all the 170 issues found last week. Good. I trust you. Great job. Boss. They hope you can join the engineering meeting next week. Ask Chen to attend. I've got a board meeting next week. Thank you, sir. Here's the contract with the virtual currency exchange. Please sign it. Ms. Hsu has read it. You just need to sign. Okay. Thank you, sir. Sir, this is the press release for the Forbes. Could you have a look? Change the headline to "SELF TOKEN is a kind of lifestyle". Don't use "TOKEN". - Boss. - Chen. Dai Yi left. I'm worried about the development progress. - Is it... - I know it's a pity. But now we have more resources. You need one person, I'll give you a hundred. Okay? You're here. - Have you got used to it? - Once you've started, you'll get used to it. Won't you? Is it really free to get the machine? It's free. Someone has paid the cost for you. Who? The miner. - Who is the miner? - Doesn't matter if you don't get it. You only need to know that it'll make money for you. Ms. Hsu. You allow us to use your platform for free. And later we can even issue a currency via this platform. - Do I understand correctly? - Yes, you do. So it's a blockchain fan economy. Isn't it? Therefore SELF TOKEN is not just a token. Because we created an individual chain for it. Why we do that is we want to encourage users, creators, anyone around the world to build own community on top of it. Great. What you think are some of the biggest challenges in a block chain industry today? The problem is how people face Blockchain and Block industry. There are three things. First, the crowd can't find the right information. Second, there is no application. And third, the government are not supporting us. That's the three things. Hello everyone. Today I'm honoured to have invited the young entrepreneur Yin Tzu hsiang. - Welcome. - Hello everyone. First, I'd like to ask Tzu hsiang. What on earth is blockchain? I think many people are confused. - What does it mean? - Actually, blockchain is simple. It's a technology that makes the Internet more transparent and fairer. In the traditional internet structure, it's controlled by centralized management. So the information could be easily manipulated by a few people who also control the profits generated. But it's totally different in the blockchain Information is testified by the public and forms a blockchain that cannot be reversed. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies are given to the participants as reward. Ten years ago, you could buy two pieces of pizza with the bitcoins, the first cryptocurrency. But now, with the same amount of bitcoins, you can get 100 million US dollars. This is the world of blockchain. A utopia where we could re-define value and regain our chances. That's why I want to issue our own currency, SELF TOKEN, through blockchain because I want to make a big fortune with you guys. A big fortune that our generation is entitled to. - Okay, thanks. - It's fine. Come. Here. To everyone. To you all. It's fate that brought us together. - Cheers. - Cheers. White and white together. Two in white. You. And you. Come over. Hi. Ms. Hsu. Long time no see. Tzu hsiang. Come on. This is a party Grand Master holds for you. Pick one. It's okay, really. Thanks. I'm sorry. Can't you see he's not happy? He doesn't like them. - I'm sorry. I'll go find more. - Wait. You didn't even ask what his type is. What if he likes men? So what do you like? Boy? - Girl? - Mike. What you're choosing is an attitude. Or you want me? Grand Master. Thank you for tonight. Let me drink a toast to you. Come. Mike. Here is to you. Thank you for your guidance. Remember... You work hard. And play hard. Of course. Work hard. And play hard. That's the spirit. Play hard. Play smart. Just treat it as a high-class entertainment. What does "high-class" mean? Let me show you. Music. Sunset House. Turning on the radio Something's floating in the air The corner diner drive through Neon signs all the way All the road you pull away From the town you had no say The doorway used to be little By her pretty eyes in the dark Do you see that sunset house from where we stand Her little roof and her rusted fence Over the hill and worn out face Do you see that sunset house from where we stand Summer pool and her sky blue dress All of them were in a million shades I want to stay So let me stay Sunset house Gosh. How could you get so drunk? Careful. Ask him to bring the contract to the company tomorrow. THE TRUSTEE IS ENTITLED TO 15% OF THE AMOUNT SELF TOKEN RAISES AS COMMISSION YIN TZU HSIANG Say it. How much do you need this time? Thirty. Thirty million. You know how much thirty million is worth? - A factory of mine. - I know. So if you don't lend it to me, I'm fine with it. It's not what I mean. I'm just worried. Don't worry. I'll definitely pay you back. You're waking up? What time is it? Just past seven. Still early. Did you sleep well? Hey. I cooked a lot. All your favourites. Come on, eat. I don't feel like eating... Yin Tzu hsiang. Look at this. Look at this. I want to exchange it for being with you all day today. No, I can't. I've got a meeting later. A meeting at eight. After this, I'll take you out for three days. Okay? I don't want to wait. I want to do it today. I want to do it this morning. - I'll be back in the evening. - I just want to talk to you. Is it that hard? - Well, what do you want to talk about? - We can talk now. Talk while I get ready. I want the old Yin Tzu hsiang back. I don't want the Yin Tzu hsiang manipulated by Hsu Ching and lies on the net. Don't think too much. - I'm working. - 30 million is enough, isn't it? Is thirty million enough? - We can ask Yi to come back. - What are you talking about? We can start afresh. You know what I'm talking about. Just see it as a bank loan. You don't have to think that much. - Enough. - It's alright. Come. Eat your breakfast. I cooked a lot of your favourite food. Eat more. And then? When you finish eating, let's go to my dad. Enough. I don't want to go to your dad. I don't need his mercy. I don't know how many times I have to tell you. Do you understand me or not? Hsi. I'm sorry. I'm wrong. - Don't touch me. - It's my fault. I'm sorry. I'll come back after work today. You think... You think I don't understand you? - That's not what I mean. - Do you understand me? I'm sorry. That's not what I mean. Chen Hsi. I'm going to a dinner soon. Just spill it out. What do you want? You can't give me what I want. If you don't tell me, how would you know? Well, you can give him what he wants. Now you've become a burden to him. Leave him... if you truly love him. Grand master, let me drink a toast to you. If it weren't for Grand Master, we wouldn't be sitting here today. No hurry. Let's do the business first. Then we'll drink. Mr. Chiang. After the crowdfunding, in addition to getting the public money out via the trust, actually, we can do one more thing. But this... Isn't it a bit too risky? No. The riskier, the safer. You practically loan it twice. Put it in a trust as well as P2P loans. The same money for three different purposes. That's why we need everyone to coordinate. I'll set up a new fund with Shin Hsin. When the market descends into chaos, no one will notice it. I'm fine with it. It depends on the minister. Since everyone is fine with it, I'll do my best to cooperate. Very good. Now the only problem is how to help Tzu hsiang carry out the project. What do you mean? Nowadays whatever related to blockchain is easy to sell. So he'll take the creditfor the project? What's wrong with that? Any problem? No. That's good. In this case, I'll seize this moment to share some good news. In the election next year, I would like our rising star to make his debut. Tzu hsiang. Are you ready? I'll work hard. Very good. Apart from you working hard, all of us will work hard with you. Right? They are big bosses. Top media owners. Prominent capitalists. They'll all work hard with you. Come. Raise your glasses. To our rising star. Plain sailing to success. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Thank you. Thank you. Maybe the promise you gave me is like this 1314 token. It's never a real thing. Yi, let's talk. I want the old Yin Tzu hsiang back. I don't want the Tzu hsiang manipulated by Hsu Ching and lies on the net. How about our original intention? Our self-respect? Dreams cannot be so simple. It cannot be so pure. Dreams have to be compromised. If we don't get our hands dirty, how can we realize our dream? Okay. How should we start? Like me. Learn how to tell an enchanting story. Hello. Hello. Standing next to me is the hottest young entrepreneur on the net. Tzu hsiang darling. Say hello to everyone, okay? Hello everyone, I'm Yin Tzu hsiang. Hello. Okay. Today Tzu hsiang is going to explain what blockchain is to us. You have to listen to him carefully. Hello. Do you know what blockchain is? I... I don't know. But I know you. Can I have a picture with you? Yes, here. 1, 2, 3. Do you know what blockchain is? No. It seems to be a new technology. Yes. But I know you. I often see you on TV. Can I have a picture with you? This is my livestream. You're very rude. Why? I want it too. Okay. Hello my darlings. Let's reveal Yin Tzu hsiang's true nature. We all know the famous saying "one fish for three dishes" or "one duck for three dishes". Well, quack, quack, quack. In this case, one man for three women. Oh, kiss kiss kiss. Yeah, chu chu chu. First love. His loving naive girlfriend who invests her daddy's millions in him. Second love. A rich powerful woman who sends him straight to the paradise. Third love. Pretty internet celebrity who is completely in love with him. Kiss kiss. Hug hug. He gains all the advantages. Did I do anything wrong? Yin gives you everything but his word. His tricks are so clever that even I was almost fooled. I can't give her my word. Ha, you're being so direct. We escaped the last financial crisis. Can't we see another coming? We can't do what we said we want to do. You still support Yin Tzu hsiang? Still support the bullshit Sandbox? In my opinion, it's all bullshit. Don't let the government and the idols fool you. That's right. Just like what she said. All right. REVEAL YIN TZU HSIANG'S PERSONAL LIFE Grand Master. The public opinion has shifted. Should we deal with it? Or it'll affect ourfurther collaboration. It's fine. Finish your soup. I'll keep an eye on him before the crowdfunding starts. I'll manipulate the public opinion as well. Oh. Yeah? How will you deal with this? I always thought he was unreliable. I sent someone to tail him and found that he was working on another plan. Ms. Hsu. If you don't tame the dog, it'll bite its owner. You know that? You keep dogs for two purposes. If you've trained it well, it's obedient and guards the house. Or... If it's killed and cooked, we can have it as food. Here. Try it. What Grand Master means is... You make not only the best but the fullest use of people. This is murder you're talking about. Eat some meat. - You too. - Thank you, Grand Master. It's almost done. Check it. What do you think of it? You're such a genius. As for the online clip about me, did you deliberately overdo it? I feel that you took your revenge on me. You know... I spend time with them every day recently. I'm really exhausted. I feel that I'm acting every day. You can't smoke in here. I know. Yi, let's talk. I want to do another crowdfunding project. A real decentralized crowdfunding project. I've already got my stage. Now I'll overturn everything. Hey. From now on, you've got to be more careful. Yes, I'll do. Don't worry. I'm more worried about Hsi. I feel sorry for her. She'll understand. Get in the car. I'm reporting from the press conference of the issue of the SELF TOKEN, the first virtual currency in Taiwan. How is the result of the crowdfunding? Everyone is eager to see if the issue will affect the government's virtual currency policy and the amendments of the related regulations. It's also the focus at the press conference today. He's got into the car. Try this. Is it good? Yes, it's good. The target is getting into position. Repeat. The target is getting into position. This time if we get 15% of it, even after it's divided between us, it's quite a lot. But... We're working out how much it will be if we get 20% of it. Minister. 0.2. Since it's a good thing, we should go for it. The target has got in position. 60-second countdown begins. The truck is ready. On the starting line. I'm ready. Minister. Project manager Yin Tzu hsiang isn't here yet. It's okay. We'll wait a bit longer. Okay. Countdown begins. Action. Start counting. Ready for the crash. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. EVERYTHING WENT AS PLANNED Let's start. But... The press conference has begun. Okay. The goose liver is so lean. Get a fatty one. Grand Master. Sometimes it's not the problem of the ingredients but cooking. Yeah? Would you like to try? If you don't mind... Today should be a day for celebration. But unfortunately, an accident happened just now. Our project manager YinTzu hsiang had a serious car accident on his way to the press conference. He's been rushed to the hospital but still in a critical condition. Will the press conference continue? Of course. The success of the Sandbox crowdfunding is Yin Tzu hsiang's biggest wish. Even if we're truly saddened by the news, we have to continue the press conference to make Yin Tzu hsiang's wish come true. Look. The netizens immediately start "one person one share" to pray for Yin Tzu hsiang. The netizens are all united. The amount raised today should reach a hundred millions. Aren't we broadcasting live? How could the netizens get the news so soon? - Yeah. - So soon. Everyone. Everyone. The Sandbox bill is an important milestone in the Taiwanese financial service. I think in the next few decades or a hundred years from now... MISSION ACCOMPLISHED ...when everyone reminiscences about today... Sir, what kind of goose liver would you like? Fatty. One bite and your mouth is covered with fat. The fattier, the crueler to the goose. Yeah? Yeah. To get a delicious fatty goose liver, you have to keep force-feeding it and stop it from moving. Even keep it awake. You have to force-feed it every day to get a fatty liver ten times larger than normal. The larger it is, the harder it gets. Wow. Then I want a portion of the fattiest. The fattier, the better. When everyone reminiscences about today, everyone who participates in the crowdfunding will become an important part of the history. All of you have made great contributions to the future. The car didn't get hit. Yin Tzu hsiang is coming. - Hey, Yin Tzu hsiang. - Isn't he involved in a car accident? Minister. Mr. Kao. Good that you're okay. Thank you both. I'll take it over from here. Impressive. Hello everyone. I'm Yin Tzu hsiang. As everyone can see, I didn't have a car accident. The reason I'm here today is to share a very interesting story with you. But it won't sound interesting enough in my words. Therefore, I've prepared a film. Mr. Chiang, after the crowdfunding, in addition to getting the public money out via the trust, actually, we can do one more thing. But isn't it a bit too risky? No. The riskier, the safer. You practically loan it twice. Put it in a trust as well as P2P loans. The same money for three different purposes. That's why we need everyone to coordinate. I'm fine. It depends on the minister. Delicious. That's good. Since you can't have it anymore. Why? What do you mean why? Why did you betray me? In a cannibal society, if I don't want to be eaten, I have to eat others. Isn't it what you taught me? Just for this? What do you want? Now you've become a burden to him. Leave him. If you truly love him. Do you understand what love means? Dai Yi left. Nick jumped off the building. You turn Tzu hsiang into a puppet. One after another, you've ruined us all. What on earth do you want? Pretending to be a puppet makes the job easier. What's this? If you don't work with us, Nick won't be the last to jump off a building. You got it? Let me ask you a question. Fire away. How did you know about the convertible bond? Nick didn't tell anyone, not even me. It's not important. Anyway, you've got no choice. Let me tell you my choice. I choose to give up. I choose to admit defeat. I'll leave at once because I don't want to become so dirty like you guys. As long as I'm alive, I'll have other chances. Open it. This... I've been working for them for ten years. Sometimes, the world you see is different from the real one. Your story is true. I never lie. To create a decentralized world, we have to get rid of the centre of the world. Actually, he isn't changed. He just doesn't want to drag you into it. Into what? Tzu hsiang. Choose one. It's alright. Come on. This is a party Grand Master holds for you. You practically loan it twice. Put it in a trust as well as P2P loans. The same money for three different purposes. I plan to kill him and bring him back to life. Try it. Ms. Hsu wants to see you. All the files are here. It's time to reveal these saints' true nature. Hsu Ching. Why are you helping us? I'm just helping myself. Five seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. What are you doing? - Go after him. - Ma'am. Mission accomplished. What are you doing? Get in the car. Who are you? We're here to help you. EVERYTHING WENT AS PLANNED Today should be a day for celebration. But just now, our project manager Yin Tzu hsiang had a serious car accident on his way to the press conference. He's been rushed to the hospital, but still in a critical condition. TZU HSIANG: I'M FINE. EVERYTHING IS GOING AS PLANNED. Actually, the Sandbox project has become the cash cow for the rich and the powerful. Any reformation that may bring changes will be rejected. And there is only one reason for this. We've lost courage. We've lost the courage to choose. Lost the courage to take responsibility. The courage to reveal the truth. But this time, facing the corrupt and incompetent world, I choose not to compromise. What I really want is to start a decentralized blockchain revolution. SELF TOKEN crowdfunding will begin in 72 hours. But what is needed next is your choice. You were jailed for only a year. Don't you think it's bit too short? Among that bunch of idiots, no one was called Hsu. I adopted my mom's surname after that. How is she? She's gone mad. Mad? What a pity. She was such a beauty. Mad? Mad. Lin Ming yen. Time to go. We know each other so well. No need to cuff me, right? Such a beauty. What a waste. SELF TOKEN CROWDFUNDING DAY 1 Yi, go. Dai Yi, actually, you can relax. Slow down a bit. Don't be nervous. We're getting just hundreds of thousands per second. Don't touch me. Can you leave me alone? - Okay, I know. The DDoS attacks... - Yin Tzu hsiang. Leave him alone. Yi, go. Hello. How is it going? Is the crowdfunding going well? You can check it yourself. I prefer to hearing it. 2.8 billion. We're nearly there. Congratulations. I should congratulate you. You've realized your dream. Enough. Come celebrate with us. Okay. Wait for me. Tzu hsiang. We made it. Give it to me. Hsu Ching. You know I really dislike you. I don't like how you do things. But, thank you. I know that without you, we wouldn't be able to make it. Thank you. Let's go. Leave him alone for a moment. HSU CHING But by doing so, you put yourself in great danger, right? Have you read the Greek mythology? There was someone called Sisyphus. He was punished by Zeus. Every day he rolled the boulder up a hill only for it to roll down when it neared the top. If he's bound to fail, what's the point of rolling the boulder again and again?
