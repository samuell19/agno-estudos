All right, you monkeys. Today we will learn an exercise called a squat thrust. We will learn how to do this exercise in the proper manner, or I will personally chew some asses off. All right, on the whistle blow. ♫ Now here's a little song about a thing called rage ♫ ♫ And you're wondering just how it feels... ♫ Squat, thrust. Squat, thrust... Mr. Noland, what the hell is going on back there? Those were the lamest squat thrusts I have ever seen in my entire 10 years of high-school gymnasium class coach. Get your ass up your front center, pronto. Pronto, damn it. Now you will do a squat thrust in the proper fashion, in front of the entire class. On the whistle blow. Squat, thrust. Squat, thrust... ♫ Don't let them get you down, don't ever lose your glory ♫ ♫ 'Cause the world's doped up, and you're part of the song ♫ ♫ So, let's all get in key and we 1! all sing along ♫ ♫ Yeah, we 1! all sing along ♫ ♫ Yeah-ah... ♫ Squat, thrust. Squat, thrust, squat-- (whistle blows) Get up, you pathetic turd. Get up. Now I will demonstrate the proper fashion in which to do this exercise. Hold my clipboard, if that's not too much to ask. ♫ Ain't got no daddy, my mama's living off of government mail ♫ ♫ But she is the one that will decide ♫ ♫ What's best for me, while pills are keeping her high ♫ ♫ Vlﬁth her and the school board against me ♫ ♫ They gave me test to see just what they might see... ♫ Observe-- you're down, extend, retract, you're here. You're down, extend, retract, you're here. Give me that clipboard, boy. - Now do it on the whistle blow. - Can't you give me a break? Give you a break? Give you a break? Son, I never got any breaks in life raised in Alabama. 12 years in the military, I never got any breaks. 64-70 pick-up, no breaks. Now repeat after me-- I had a damn fine gymnasium class coach. I had a damn fine-- I had a damn fine gymnasium class coach. Now, then, you will demonstrate 30 squat thrusts in the proper fashion, in front of this class. On the whistle blow. (bell ringing) I am the head of the guidance department. And my name... is Mr. Korn. Now, hold on. I know what you're thinking. You are thinking to yourselves, “Oh, man, with a name like that, this guy had best be down with where my generation is coming from, huh? Otherwise, he is whack!“ ( laughs ) Okay... well, I'm gonna be taking over this class for the next two weeks. And I'll just be here to talk to you about stuff like college, and jobs... and fun things like that. Now i have an assignment for you. i want you to write a paper. it'll be due at the end of two weeks. But that's not your homework for tonight. I know, I know. Hold on! Let me get a word in here, please. Boo, grown up homework stuff. I want you to help me out. i want you to jot down some ideas for tomorrow's class. Like, where do you see yourselves in 10 years? Are you gonna be married? Single? You got kids? What's your job like? Are you gay? Straight? Hooked on drugs? Sober? Just give me the whole Iollapalooza. ( chuckles ) - Hey. - Hey. I was looking for that book. Are you gonna check it out? Maybe. Okay. I'm trying to find a topic for my career paper. Whatever. Well, it was nice talking to you. - What the hell are you doing? - Check this out, baby. Very impressive. Mr. Grimaldi made me do 30 squat-thrusts today. That's the advantage of being in Special Ed. We don't have to take gym. It makes it up for being with the retards all day. Next year I'm gonna sign up with the “retard" classes with you, but... No, you don't wanna be doing that. We got all the lame chicks. You guys get all the hotties, like that Sasha you're always talking about. Sasha seems like she's into murder and stuff. She was wearing a Charles Manson t-shirt today in the library and reading a book about killers. So I got a bunch of them. Chicks love these guys. The Night Stalker, Richard Ramirez, Ted Bundy-- they both married fans while they were in prison. I think you might be on to something here, man. (scream, explosion ) - Hi, babe. - What are you cooking for dinner? Very funny. - So, how was school? - Fine. You got any tests or papers coming up, Case? You gotta get your grades up if you're gonna get into a good college. - Not this again, Mom. - Just keep me posted, okay? You never cared before Dad died. Now it's myjob to make sure you get everything done. So just give me a break, okay? ♫ She swam to me, yeah... ♫ TV host: Hi, I'm J. D. Rock. You may remember me as the host of the game show Fun House. You wanna make more money? Heck, we all do. Call now for a free brochure and how to earn a degree in auto mechanics, real estate, or computers-- Worried about not having your high- school diploma, but you like to travel? Why not call JWA Transport? And we'll get you driving the big rigs. When I graduated from high school, I knew college wasn't for me. That's why I went to the Tech Effects Institute for Computers. Police this morning found the body of a local high school student. He was with his girlfriend, who officials claim is still missing. Police have yet to release the names of the victims, but our sources tell us that authorities are now considering the recent murders to be the work of a single serial killer-- Narrator: Theodore Robert Bundy considered himself to be a predator. He preyed on young women. He murdered at least 30 of them. He told me, “I decided to take the shortcut to be... powerful and well known and to be-- to make my mark on the world.“ - I'll meet her. - Man: They're all my children. Anybody that's ever seen me has followed my footsteps. How else could they do anything else? ♫ Toot-toot. ♫ I know my mind. And I trust the very same person that you do. And the very same person that you do. I trust the only person left to trust-- me. ( dog barking ) ( barking continues ) Shh! Would you please be quiet? Shut up! Shut the fuck up! ♫ Hey, you, shut the fuck up! ♫ ♫ Shut the fuck up! ♫ ♫ Shut the fuck up! ♫ Goddamn dog. Hey, I got those stickers you asked for. Oh, great. This is gonna be awesome. Man, you look burnt out. Old man Cruder's new dog woke me up again last night. That goddamn dog barks every night. I mean, I know where-- I can get you some C-4, we could shove it up that puppy's ass and blow that fucking mutt to Delaware. - Have you gone postal? - No, but check this out. Last night, I'm watching the Jenny Jones Show, okay? They got these supermarket employee makeovers. Are you following me? They take these fat ugly chicks and turn them into fat ugly chicks with makeup. I mean, fucking those are the people you gotta kill. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Somebody's gotta clean up the crap. - Man, just kill those motherfuckers. - I hear you. Hey, check this shit out. Holy shit! - That's disgusting. - Serial killers struck again. I've got the pictures to prove it. Show and tell, baby. Having a dad as a police photographer must make you the coolest kid in Special Ed. Nah. Actually, this one chick's dad is a drug dealer. It kind of sucks. ♫ i needed you then, i needed you then ♫ ♫ i bet you know i don't need you now ♫ ♫ We were good friends, yes, you know, we were good friends ♫ ♫ But you know you lost me somehow ♫ ♫ it's a beautiful life ♫ ♫ it's a world of delight... ♫ Okay, now if you'll all just pass your outlines up front, - we can read them aloud. - Oh my God, how embarrassing. Thank you, and thank you. Okay. Well, let's see what we've got. - Hey, Mr. “Pekela.“ - That's “Pekala.“ Mr. “Pekala.“ “In 10 years, I see myself as a gynecologist, because I feel it's important for young girls to have someone to help them with their... vaginal problems.“ That's “vaginal," Mr. “Picalla.“ Very funny. Very funny. Let's see... voila. Okay. “In 10 years... I will be the CEO of Revlon.“ Marni Greenstein. Well, that is very interesting, Ms. Greenstein. And I can see that clearly you are off to a very good start. You're so money. You do know it. Let's see what else we have here. Ah, Mr. Casey Noland. “In 10 years, i see myself on death row... convicted... of being the most notorious serial killer in history. They caught me after i decapitated my gym teacher. " Ew, what a psycho! I don't find this very funny, Mr. Noland. And we're gonna wrap about this after class. All right. We've read enough of these. We 're gonna be handing you out the Life Goals Evaluations Test. And this should give you a pretty good idea of the sorts of careers and vocations that will best suit you and your personal ambitions. You will need a #2 pencil. Please don't go outside the circles. (crowd cheers, applauds) Mr. Noland, you should know that the use of CD players - during school hours is forbidden. - I was just listening to-- And you will excuse me if I relieve you of this toxic-- pardon my French-- crap as well. ( bell ringing ) So, you like Marilyn Manson? - Yeah. - Me, too. I liked your career choice. Thanks. I'm gonna return that book to the library this afternoon, if you wanna check it out. It'll be in. - Yeah, thanks. - That's no problem. How cute. Two freaks in love. Thank you. Mr. Noland... I didn't find your paper very amusing. Killing people isn't the bomb. - It's just not funny. - Depends on who you ask. Now you listen to me. If you want to pass this course, you're gonna hand in another paper besides this one and do it properly this time. Do you understand? Yes, sir. And by the way... thanks for the diet tip. Oh, Marni. Someone seems to have left their jacket behind. Would you do me a favor and run it over to Lost and Found? - But I'm gonna be late for gym class. - Thank you. Hello? Hello? - ( screams ) - What the fuck are you doing here? I am lost. I am trying to find Lost and Found. No, no, wait, wait. Here, we keep that shit in here. What you got there, pretty girl? Oh, it must have been expensive. You are a pretty girl. You wanna sit? - I've got some beer in the fridge. - No, thanks. I have to get to class. Wait! Where are you going? The kid will learn his lesson, huh? ( spits ) They're ungrateful. They're all ungrateful bastards and bitches. What you're gonna want to ask yourself today, is, “Can I hurl the plastic disc in a fashion that will please Mr. Grimaldi, or will i hurl it in an improper fashion and displease Mr. Grimaldi, thusly receiving a boot upside my buttocks?" I think you'll choose the first option. Take the disc and hurl it to your neighbor in the other line. On the whistle blow. And... Good throw. Good catch. Good throw. Good catch. Good throw. Good catch. Good throw. Good catch. - Good-- - ( whistle blows) Mr. Noland, what the Sam hell is wrong with you, huh? You can't even throw a plastic disc like you don't squat to pee? Try it again. And this time throw it like you got a pair. On the whistle blow. And... Did you try to hit me with that plastic disc? Did you? Did you try to express your hatred for Mr. Grimaldi? Well, if you did, try it again. And this time, throw it like you got a pair of nuts. Take the plastic disc. Throw it at me. Do it. Do it. You pathetic turd. I cannot believe that you throw like a woman. Well, We gotta get somebody to teach you how to throw like a man. Ms. Barman, get your ass up here. Take him over in the corner and teach him how to throw like a man. Do it now! The rest of you resume the activity. You know, Mr. Noland, if you continue in this fashion, you'll be the first student to ever fail gymnasium class in the history of square buildings with wooden floors. The rest of you continue on the whistle. ♫ At least the monkey was my own I ♫ i let him go because We grown... ♫ These kids are maggots. Fucking tater tots all over the lunch room. Goddamn kids. Where are their fucking parents? ( alternative rock music playing ) ♫ Although you think you're very clever: ♫ Long ago i was alone ♫ ♫ But i had my monkey on my back ♫ ♫ Now my monkey's gone away ♫ ♫ it's worse this time, l'm aware of life every day. ♫ That's disgusting. I think I'm gonna be sick. I don't feel good. I can't do this. Mr. Horror Movies is grossed out by a dead pig? - I don't believe it. - Can I go to the nurse? Well, I have to fail you if you don't complete this project. Can I make it up with extra credit? Well... we'll work something out. Yes, go. You go. Go ahead. - Thanks, Mr. Rabino. - It's the second door on the right. No, the third door. Mrs. Prisano. Ah, she can handle it. Keep cutting. Very good. ♫ Let's do it. ♫ What you reading? “The Psychosis of Murder.“ So, I guess you're really into this stuff. You know, I never met anyone that wanted to be a serial killer. - It's pretty cool. - Thanks. If you're serious about this stuff, you're gonna need some help. - Help? - Yeah, look at all these books. It's gonna take you weeks to get through all this information. Unless you had someone who can do the research with you. - Like who? - Who do you think? Then what's in it for you? Hmm... let's just say I share a personal interest in this topic. I help you become a serial killer and you let me be your first victim. - What? -Yeah, you heard me. -You wanna die? - It's not a question of dying. It's a matter of fame. “Sasha Fitzgerald, the first victim of serial killer Casey Noland.“ Yeah, it does have a nice ring to it. Yeah, I wanna be the Sharon Tate of the '90s. So, do we have a deal? - ( knock on door) - What? What did you do now? You and I have a little meeting tomorrow after school, - with your guidance counselor? - That guy is a jerk-off. I didn't take his stupid aptitude test seriously. He said something about killing people. I told him that I wanted to be a serial killer when I grow up. Very funny, Casey. Come on, you can't kid around like that in school. Come downstairs. I got “Taco Hell“ for dinner. - Mrs. Noland. - Mr. Korn. Thank you for coming by. Casey, come on in. Have a seat. Okay. Well, let's get down to the business at hand. - Has Casey shown you this paper? - Ah... no. Well, evidently, your son finds it humorous to joke about death and murder. Mr. Korn, Caseyjust has this really odd sense of humor. Yes. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't find mutilation and dismemberment to be an appropriate topic for a paper. I'm gonna fail him if he doesn't change the subject. All right. Well, I promise I will help Casey pick a new topic. in addition, I gave Casey a career profile survey, which incidentally I had to mark by hand. (sighs) He is qualified to be either... a parking meter maid, a night security guard, or a toll booth operator. Not very ambitious careers, are they? Mr. Korn, Casey's a bright kid. He just hasn't found his niche. Well, Casey, give me “the McCoy.“ When you graduate at the end of this year, - what do you wanna do? - I don't know. - Toll booth operator sounds good. - Mrs. Noland: Casey! Casey, you're not dissing me. You're dissing yourself. Because in six months you will have graduated from this high school, and you have no plans for your future. Listen, i know it must be very tough for a young man to start his senior year at a new school, but this behavior... is abnormal. Incidentally, I took this from Casey. It's a band called Marilyn Manson and I don't know whether or not you are familiar with their lyrics. No. It's not exactly my kind of music. Well, in this song, they are talking about eating cake and sodomizing each other and... that date rape is a kind thing to do. They are clearly glorifying Satan. They are proclaiming themselves to be the gods of-- - the gods-- - Fuck. Gods of fuck. Casey, stop it! This is what I'm talking about, Mrs. Noland. Ah, Ms. Lindon. Very nice to see you. Thank you for coming by. Mrs. Noland, Casey, this is Ms. Sally Lindon, the school psychologist. It's nice to meet you. Sorry I'm late. Ms. Lindon and I have talked it over. We feel it would be extremely helpful if Casey would start counseling twice a week. - What? - Excuse me. No offense, but... I don't know if I'm exactly thrilled - about my son seeing a shrink. -Yeah, me neither. Of course Casey doesn't have to go to counseling with Ms. Lindon, but if he doesn't, I'm gonna fail him on his paper. - ( sighs ) - Ms. Lindon: it won't be that bad. Instead of going to the gym, you come spend that period with me. Cool. Mrs. Noland, Casey shows many of the troubling signs we associate with... mentally disturbed adults, but if we can nip it in the bud, we can help Casey become a respectable, responsible, - contributing member of society. - ( sighs ) His father passed away a year ago and... We're aware of that, Mrs. Noland. But it's time for Casey to start moving past his grief. - Ray, there's been another-- - ( flatulence) Oh, Jesus Christ! Mexican again?! - Another what? - Another murder down at the park. You'd better hurry up. The press is already down there. Press? Press. You have no idea what you're gonna do with the rest of your life. Well, have a look at this paper. Look at this survey. You know, quite frankly... I think the only thing you're qualified to be is... a serial killer. You know what? You're absolutely right. This is not psychologically normal, Casey. Casey, will you stop killing your teachers? Honey, you are never gonna graduate! That was stupid fresh, Casey. Maybe this is the right career for you. ( barking ) ( dog barking ) Casey: Mr. Grimaldi? Why aren't you dressed for gymnasium class? I have to meet with the school psychiatrist. Ms. Lindon? What in the hell for? Well, they say is that I don't have enough direction in my life. Casey... what you need in your life is more discipline. I think you know that. The kind of discipline that it can only be found here in gymnasium class. Casey, if you allow this class to be something in your life, it can be a warm, nurturing, embracing nest. Like chickens have in a hen house. You know what I mean? I'm gonna go. I'm gonna be late for... Ms. Lindon. Another thing... if I find out it was you who put those bumper stickers on my van, I'm gonna squash your nuts into oblivion. And tell those boys from home economics to stop calling my house. - How about this one? - The blob. - What does this look like to you? - The sequel. - And this one? - A vagina? - Casey, do you remember your dreams? - Sometimes. - Tell me about them. - Well, last night, I had a dream that I took I really big knife and Iopped off Mr. Korn's head and then I threw the knife in your skull. Then Mr. Korn's decapitated head told me I'd be a good serial killer. You know, Casey, this would be an excellent extracurricular activity for you. it would give you an opportunity to be of help in the community and to socialize with kids your own age. “Adopt a grandparent?“ You've seen the signs in the school, haven't you? Yeah, but old people? They're so... old. I think you'll find spending time with the elderly to be very rewarding. Listen to this: “Everything serial offenders do and think about is directed towards assisting and fulfilling their otherwise inadequate lives. This book says that the most crucial single factor in the development of a serial killer is the role of fantasy. Edmund Kemper's fantasy involves sex and death. He had to completely possess his partner, this meant possessing her life. So, what's your fantasy? I guess I don't have one. Well, it also says that Kemper was like this because he was trying to rid himself of his domineering and abusive mother. So, what's your mom like? Is she cool? Yeah. Yeah, my mom is great. Things have been kind of tough on her since my dad died, though. - Sorry. - Yeah. He was a cop. Some scumbag shot him. We moved out here to start over. Your dad was a cop. Why be a serial killer? Sally, I wanted to talk to you about Casey Noland. Sorry, I meant to send you a note. He's gonna be meeting with me twice a week. Oh, really? Missing more gymnasium class, will he? You know, he's failing as it is. Casey has a number of problems to work through. - Oh, yeah. Like what? - That's too complicated to get into. Sally, I'm concerned about Casey Noland's welfare just like you are. Casey wants to become a serial killer. (laughing) - Really? - It's really not funny, Vince. It's a little funny. Listen... I know you've got your psycho mumbo-jumbo business going on, but that's not gonna give him the proper discipline that Casey needs. That discipline can only be found in gymnasium class. The only thing he finds in gymnasium class are more problems. Serial killer, huh? Shut up, Frank. - How are your grades? - Why? It looks like a lot of these guys are really smart. Like Edmund Kemper, he had an IQ of 146. So, how did you do on your last English exam? - I didn't study for it at all. - What was your grade? A D+. Look, if you wanna be like these guys, you're really gonna have to start doing better in school. You're also are gonna have to start dressing better. What's wrong with the way I dress? I mean, I like it. It's cool, but... it's not the way these guys dress. You gotta be more conservative. Look at this. Ted Bundy-- he was a young Republican. And when they catch these guys, the neighbors always say, like, “Oh, he was such a nice man. We had no idea. He was such a quiet man.“ You know, you have to blend in. - Blend in? - Yeah. - I don't even know where to start. - I do. - So, what do you think? - Very nice. You look like J. Crew's evil twin. - lf anybody's got any information... - Hey, check it out. ...about the murder of Michael Berman or Tara Bolasky, who is still missing, notify your police department. Tragic. Here's Chuck with the weather. Tragic? I'll tell you what's tragic. I just got my new car washed and we're expecting rain, rain, rain. Wow. I bet with all the information we have, we could probably catch this killer. - Yeah, maybe. - I wish I could talk to him. You know, see what it's like, get some pointers from him. I don't think he'd be too interested in chatting. Yeah, so what's in the book? Anything interesting? Yeah, it says you first need to pick a type of a victim. Like Ted Bundy liked to kill teenage girls. I don't think I could kill teenage girls. I like 'em too much. How about ifl kill old people? Put them out of their misery. Maybe even terminally ill patients. Yeah. You could be Casey Noland, the Dr. Kevorkian of serial killers. I like that. Okay, now you need a type of a pattern, like the Zodiac Killer. How about I kill every time one of those infomercials come on - for the Psychic Pals Network? - No, it's on too often. How about a weapon or a special way of killing? Okay, but I wanna be original. I wanna use something no one's ever used before, so it guarantees me a place in history. - How about a baseball bat? - That's too athletic. - A chainsaw? - That's used in too many movies. Jeffrey Dahmer once drilled a hole in a victim's head while the guy was still alive and then he poured acid inside. Mrs. Noland: Dinner! - Mom... - Mmm? - ...this is Sasha. - Mmm. Excuse me. Well, hello. Pleased to meet you. ( laughs ) Casey, look at you. Mr. Clean Cut, huh? Looks like you're a good influence on him. Thanks. So, anyway, you wanna stay for dinner? No, thanks. I don't eat meat. I can whip you up a salad or... cereal? That's all right. I gotta go. Okay. It was nice to meet you, Mrs. Noland. You too. So, I got tickets to that Marilyn Manson concert on Thursday night, if you wanna go. That concert's sold out. Well, I know, but my dad's company was able to get tickets, so... Yeah-- no, I'd love to go. Cool. Great. I'll see you in class tomorrow. - Bye, Case'. - Bye. Case'. ( laughs ) Don't even start with me, no. I'm not gonna say a word. Well, she's-- she's cute. Oh, man, look at it. Junk mail and more bills. - Man: Maylhelp you? - Actually, I can have a little... help. - Oh, but these are nice over here. - Oh, yeah-- yeah, I like these. Yeah, they're 7 1/4-inch "dinanite carbicle" T-saw blades. Then you're gonna have to buy one of these big babies here. - No, I'll just take the blades. - Just want the blades? All right, fine. Movin' right along. Oh, it's here-- you're gonna need one of these for your tools. You've got so much stuff, a little tool belt for you. Let's see. One of these, one of these. One of these, one of those, and two of these. Good. Turn. - Is this a good grass blower? - Ah, yeah, yeah. That-- it blows. It blows well, actually. The problem is, they're not very dangerous. What if something sharp got stuck in it? Like those giant drill bits. What if somebody took one of those and shoved it in there and started it? Ahh, ooh-- yeah, that would hurt. See you later. Toodles. Weird guy. - Yeah. - Hey, can I come in? -Yeah, come in. - Whoa, awesome tools. - Yeah. - How'd you pay for all those? Dad's insurance. I couldn't decide on just one weapon. There's just too many of 'em. That's okay, you can be the hardware store murderer or something. I brought some books-- they might help you out. - Cool. - What's this? Oh, that's my dissection program for biology class. Oh, cool. I got this great stuff off the internet. The psychological profile of a serial killer. Let me see. Let's see. “Body disposal: Hide the body, dismember it, display it, throw it away or a combination of any of the above.“ I don't think I have space to display it and I don't think my mom's gonna be very happy with dead bodies hanging on all over, so I need to throw 'em away. It would be easier if you dismembered it and then trashed it. I guess, but I'm not gonna be too comfortable with chopping up dead bodies. I can't even dissect a fetal pig. Okay... “Take a souvenir or trophy from the victim, like a ring or a necklace.“ Yeah, it lets you relive the kill. These guys would give them to their girlfriends or their wives-- it would reassert their domination and control. I guess I'm not gonna have anybody to give a souvenir to. “Postmortem sex.“ - Sex with an old dead lady? -Yeah, a lot of the killers do it. I think I'm gonna pass on that one. Okay, so you're not into sexual experimentation. Okay... the killer is a male. Check. The victims' race will be the same as the killer's. Check. - Usually single? - Check. And middle class. Check. - Resides away from the crime scene. -You know, that's not a problem. There's an old age home half an hour away from here. - What kind of car does your mom drive? - A Taurus. Why? According to John Douglas, the Volkswagen Beetle was a serial murderers' car of choice. That's weird. You know who has a VW? That crazy janitor at school. - Maybe he's a serial killer. - That guy is a freak. I mean, he walks around all day at school, mumbling to himself, mopping the floors. I heard they hired him off some mental institution program or something. ( barking ) That fucking dog keeps me up all night long. You know, Edmund Kemper once said that the true measure of a psychopath lies in the quality of his animal torture. Ithink you should kill the dog. I was thinking about that, but I thought I'd be better off killing people. You should take this one step at a time. You don't wanna rush into anything. I think you need to start small. - Kill it. - Fine. I'll kill a fucking dog. You know what? You should do it after the show. - We gotta go. - Okay. ( crowd screaming ) What's this about women in the army? What kind of a military is that, huh? I'll tell you what, I think those guys are all a bunch of fags and they like to put on their little green uniforms and parade around, am I right? Ha! You are such a dickhead. Pull up your pants. You're talking out your ass. I was in the military. And I worked with a lot of women. And not one of them was a fag. - Jesus, Vince, man-- - Hey! Can it, boy! I didn't know you were in the military. Military was the best thing that ever happened to me. You know, I was raised up in Alabama by a one-titted whore. Whoring for a living, what my momma was doing. Whenever she played out on me, my grandma and my grandpa raised me. They died when I was 16 and then I went to the army. - I didn't know, I-- - Well, now you know. - I'm sorry. - Fighting in Granada for the US of A, storming the medical campus, hand-to-hand combat with Mexican medical students. That's so shitty. It's a good thing, that army training. I pass that on to my gymnasium class students, too. - I'm sorry, Vince. - Oh, shut up. You're not a man. You're a prancing, little ball, a sissy thing. Look, Vince, I didn't know you were-- Oh, I'm just funnin' you. I'm just funnin' you. Casey: Oh, wow. - Great Marilyn Manson concert. - Casey: Yeah. - You left your keys in the car. - Oh, shit. Do you have anything we can break in with? No. We gotta call a locksmith. - How are you doing, Vince? - Hey, Ray, how are you doing? - Good, good, good. How's work? -You know how it is. Little bastards don't appreciate nothing that you do for 'em. Wipin' their asses one day and their noses the next. How is it going with that serial killer? Between you and me, we got a few suspects. We 're looking for a younger man. Because lots of these psychos, they look for victims their own age. Uh-huh. Well, if you're looking for a young guy that has the wants and desires of a woman trapped inside a man's body, you oughta talk to Pessin over here. - Jesus, I said I was sorry. - Yeah. You know, speaking of... that serial killin' business, I got this kid in my gymnasium class who says he wants to grow up and be a serial killer. -You are kidding me. - I'm not kidding. He's in therapy for it. I mean, you ask me, he couldn't kill a housefly if his head was shaped like a swatter. But somebody believes him. They got him in that counseling. All right. - What's this kid's name? - Noland. - Casey Noland. - All right. - I'm on it. - Good. - ( pager beeps ) - Goddamn it. All right. I'm out of here. Get everybody a drink on me, except for Pessin. Casey Noland. - Thanks for the ticket. - No problem. Who else was I gonna ask-- it wasn't a date. You know what, Sasha, I'm kind of embarrassed about this, but... I really like you. ( car door shuts ) Grimaldi: You called for a locksmith? Mr. Grimaldi? Well, corn hole me at the Saturday dance, Casey Noland, my favorite gymnasium class student. - You're a locksmith? - I am a locksmith, Casey, on weeknights and weekends. Gotta work a second job, you know? Well, with the economy being what it is... quite frankly, the working man's place in the work force is always at risk, being usurped by foreign influences. But I don't have to tell you that. You probably know what I mean. Maybe not. What do we got going on here? I-- I locked my keys in the car. All righty, then. I'll justjump right in, have this worked out in two shakes of a Iamb's tail, have you and your little pretty friend out of here, double time! Thanks, Mr. Grimaldi. Your name's... Sasha, isn't it? Yeah, I had you sophomore year. ( laughs ) You sure did. There you go, Case'. Thanks, Mr. Grimaldi. How much-- how much do I owe you? You can give me Sasha and we'll call it even. Ha! Just funnin' ya. No charge tonight. You two kids run along. - Thanks. That's really nice. - Yeah, thanks. Now, don't tell anybody at high school. I wouldn't wanna ruin my reputation as a hard ass. Sure. Drive carefully! Good night. Sleep tight. Ah, enough of this shit. I'm gonna go see the real thing. I still can't believe that dick had to be the one to help us. i don't know why you hate him so much. He seems like a really nice guy. - I had a good time tonight. - Yeah, me too. Thanks for going with me. Good night. Good night. I-- I'll call you tomorrow. ( muffled screams ) - ( squeaks ) . He-. (grunts) (toy laughing) Let's get messier. ( laughs ) How groovy! No, that's too “Evil Dead.“ Time to carve some puppy? Fuck it! Let's get over with it. ( squeals ) (engine sputters) - ( engine humming) - ( shot fires) (yelps) ( squeals ) Hygiene isn't just about “Hey, get the germs off me, man.“ But it's also very important on a job interview... - Did you do it? - No, I couldn't do it. - He was too cute. -You couldn't even kill a dog. I just-- Now, it's also very important, when you're going on thatjob interview... Did you hear what happened with Marni Greenstein? - No, what happened? - She disappeared last night. There were cops swarming around her house all morning. - Are you through? - Yes. Are you sure there's nothing you'd like to share with the class? - No. - Okay. Now, teeth-- brush 'em. You don't wanna go to that interview with your breath smelling like “booty." Today we're gonna play a little word association. I say a word and you tell me the first word or two that comes to mind. Gotcha. - Red. - Blood. - Boy. - George. - Girl. - Boy George. - Casey! - Me? - ( sighs ) - What? You know, you've really been improving this past week. You cleaned yourself up. You're dressing better. Your grades are improving. I'm really proud of you. - But why can't you ever be serious? - ( knocking on door) Come in. - Ahh, Ms. Sally Lindon? - Yes? I'm Detective Raymond Berro. I... I'm looking for one of your students. Casey Noland? - Is there a problem? - No, ma'am. There's no problem. Nothing's wrong. But I would like to talk to him alone. - Well, I'll be right outside. - Fine, thank you. So, hot shot, I hear you wanna be a serial killer. Yeah, so? So, I have a missing girl here with your name written all over it. You know this girl? Yeah, it's Marni Greenstein. She's in one of my classes. I understand you don't get along very well. Yeah, she was a stuck-up bitch. - Where were you last night? - I went to a concert. - Yeah, what did you do after that? - I went home and I went to bed. - Yeah, what did you do after that? - Well, I-- - What did you do? - Okay, I admit it. Ijerked off. Hey! ( loud whistle) Don't become a smart ass with me. - Ray. - Yeah. Excuse me, but there's-- there's something you should see. You don't go anywhere. We interviewed a teacher named Korn. He claims he sent the girl to the lost and found. So, we go to the lost and found... it's in the boiler room. So, we searched the place, right? And we find this, Marni Greenstein's notebook. - Who's this guy? - He's the janitor. Custodian. Head custodian. Custodian. Excuse me. Not only that, he's got a very keen interest in young girls. I think this is our guy. I say we take him down to the station and see if we get him to talk. All right. But in the meantime... I wanna keep my eye on this kid. Brad, bring him in. Wait a minute. This thing is way too damn loud. I'm surprised you didn't get caught last night. You know, Frank, the janitor? He was arrested. Yeah, I know. They got the wrong guy. He even doesn't fit the profile. They must know something we don't. They don't know anything. They're stupid cops. No, they questioned you. We gotta be careful now. What does it matter? I couldn't even kill a damn dog. - I am a failure. - Relax. You just need to kill a real person. After your first, it's not supposed to be that tough. I think I'm gonna go and kill one of those old people first. Just to practice. I promise, ifl ever get caught, I'll tell everyone you were my first kill. I hope I am your first. We should scope out the old age home tomorrow. - You wanna go? - Yeah, sure. ♫ in a peril-act world... ♫ - Casey, what are we looking for? - Someone who looks senile. - How about that one? - Let me see. - Casey: oh-ho, per'lbct. - So, what are you gonna do? I figure I'll find a good time to go up there and grab one of these old farts and carry 'em away. Do you think that's gonna work? They're so dazed, they don't know what's going on. I'll drive her to some secluded spot and kill her. Unbelievable! That old bag's been walking in circles for hours. I never wanna get old. They look so bored and hopeless. Yeah, God, I hate retirement homes. it's like you can smell the death inside. Hey, wait, listen to this. There's more Volkswagen stuff in this book. It says that a lot of the serial killers own VW Beetles, but then they switch to a van. “Because unlike a car, in the back of the van you can do whatever you want and not be seen. You have in effect a mobile murder site.“ - You know who drives one of those? - I almost forgot... they let Frank, the janitor, go last night. They said he had an alibi. And that the police think that the killer had some kind of special tools, so that he could sneak into these homes so easily. They're calling him-- The locksmith killer. Sasha, it's Grimaldi! Oh, come on. I agree there are a lot of similarities, but I refuse to believe that a high school gym teacher is a serial killer. He is a war vet. He's probably killed many people. Plus, he drives a VW van. You're insane. Just because you don't like the guy, it doesn't mean-- Look, all these victims are young girls, high school girls. Have you seen “Silence of the Lambs“? We covet what we see every day. This guy is surrounded by hot chicks in short shorts. Casey, that's a movie. It's not real. Grimaldi is the killer. I'm gonna prove it. - Hit any? - Three for three. Cool. I need a favor. -You need some C-4? - No, no C-4. I need some information. Can you go to the police station with your dad? Yes, I could go there. He's going there tonight. Can you see what you can dig up on Mr. Grimaldi? Yes, I will bring a shovel. What do you need it for? Ijust have a hunch. Good to go. Time to kill. - Come on, it's time to go to bed. - Charles, is that you? - No, my name isn't Charles. Come on. - I know that's you, Charles. Oprah, come meet my grandson Charles. He just stopped by for a visit. What a lovely surprise! So nice to meet you... Charlie. Come on, it's time to go in! - Time to go in. Good girl. -You know, I think-- I think... - Charlie is gonna come with us. - Oh, shit. - Aren't you, Charles? - Yeah. What are you doing, Amil? You're not messing up my computers again, are you? - No, I'm just playing some games. - Where's your dad? He is in the dark room. Losen Hey, everyone. This is my grandson, Charlie. Nice to meet you, son. We've heard so much about you. Look at those dimples. He's adorable. - Now, what's with all those tools? - He's a big-time carpenter. Just look at that punum! He's got your looks. So, where's the girlfriend? You're not one of them faggots, are you? Holly shite! Whoo-oo! - Have you constructed big sky rises? - Do you build mansions? Now, with all those tools, you must be a busy boy. Jesus Christ! I'm not a carpenter! I'm an undercover detective. Yeah, I'm currently tracking a serial killer who goes after young girls. Wow, how do you do that? First, I draw a psychological profile of the murderer. I figure out his motive, his weapons, any pattern that he may be killing. How do you know? Many serial killers, they fit a particular lifestyle. They're very charismatic, although they lack soul. Thank you for coming to see me, Charlie. You know I don't have much time. I've been telling my friends about you for years. They started to think you don't exist. I'm so proud of you. When you were younger, you were such a loose cannon, but you've become such a respectable young man. I love you, Charlie. I love you too, Gram. Mr. Pekla, what job experiences do you have? - I worked in a fast food restaurant. - Mm-hmm. They fired me. I pissed in their shake machine. Dude, please. Try to take this seriously. ( bell ringing ) What's wrong? I had another bad fight with my parents last night. - And how'd you do? - I bonged. That old lady thought I was her grandson. I'm gonna give up. This is getting really ridiculous. You're not giving up. Tonight. You and me at the park. You want me to kill you tonight? Yes, I still wanna be your first victim. - Are you sure you wanna die? - Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Tonight... at the park. Yes, ma'am. Uh-huh. The kid was by the Palms nursing home last night. I want you to stop by later and see what he was up to. Hold on, please. Ray, I'm following three other leads-- Do it. Go ahead, please. Were your parents related before they were married? Get your ass up that rope. Mr. Grimaldi, I have a meeting with Ms. Lindon today. Another one of those stupid meetings. Casey, when are you gonna learn? The discipline that you need, the help that you need, is right here in gymnasium class. You're right. If I could just climb that rope, - my life would be wonderful. - Listen to me, you pole-smoking “Playgirl" subscriber. You will treat me with respect in my class. Do you understand me? Repeat that! I will treat you with respect in your class. Get the hell out of here! Tell me about your childhood. Well, Ms. Lindon, it was kind of tough. I was a bastard child. And my mother told me my father was probably a sailor she met one night. Then, when I was seven, she remarried a man named Mike... Mike “Cock-In-You.“ And he used to tease me. He used to send me to school in dresses. He said I wasn't manly enough. If that wasn't bad enough, he left my mother when I was 14 and by that time, I had a nine-year-old half sister. And my mother was afraid that I'd rape her. So, every night, before bed, she'd lock me up in the basement and I spent... many nights planning my revenge on that bitch! - Are you finished? - No, wait. I didn't tell you about my uncle Bob, Bob Booey. When are you gonna grow up and start acting like an adult? You can't spend the rest of your life goofing off. I'm 17 years old. Why is everyone in such a hurry for me to grow up? Everybody else your age realizes it's time to start planning their lives. You know, I don't wanna be like everybody else. Well, if you're not, you're gonna be left behind. Everybody else will be married and in good steadyjobs, while you're still trying to decide what you want to be. - Do you wanna be some kind of freak? - A freak? Why am I a freak? Look, every time somebody wants to do something different, you shrinks classify them as crazy. Half the kids my age say they're gonna do something and they're not gonna end up doing it. The ones that are gonna do it, they're not gonna be happy. - That's not necessarily true. - Are you happy? We're talking about you, Casey. And I'm not saying you're crazy. You know what? I am crazy. I am a fucking psychopath and I'm proud of it. I have no ambition? I have ambition. - I wanna be a serial killer. -You're not a killer, Casey. - It's not something you can become. - Yeah, we'll see about that. I just wish that you could take all this knowledge about murder and death and apply it to something more positive. Positive? Positive?! We live in a world where a man kills his wife and gets off scot free. Teenagers are having babies and throwing them in dumpsters. My father is getting shot by a bank robber. - How positive do you want me to be? - Casey! Casey! Yo, Casey, where have you been, man? - I've been looking for you everywhere. - I got to get the hell out of here. I've got that information that you asked for. Vince Grimaldi lives in a small apartment on Gayhouse Lane with his mother. Twice he tried to become a cop, but he failed the examination. Twice. You know, that is not that unusual. A lot of people fail that psychological stuff. But this, this is unusual, man! - Check this out! - What is it? See, this is some information that you did not ask for. You see, I dug a little deeper and came up with this shit right here. Grimaldi was in a mental institution when he was a teenager. - Oh, shit! - Yeah. This motherfucker killed his grandparents? Yeah. How can they let him become a teacher? It doesn't-- I know. His mother, she convinced them to seal his file when he turned 18. I guess they thought they cured him. - How did you get this if the file was-- - Don't worry about it, man. I just get into the mental health main frame using a CIA hub. I just hack that shit. So, it's no big deal. - I owe you one... seriously. - I know how you can repay me. Take some C-4 and blow this motherfucker up. Fucking boom! Fuck! C-4, man. That's the shit, man. I've got the skill to kill. I've got the urge to purge? Fuck! - I can't do it. - Why not? - You're just sitting there. - What do you want me to do? I don't know. - Run away from me, I guess. - Okay. What's wrong? Amil dug up info on Grimaldi. This guy's a psycho, Sasha. - He's killed people before. - Oh, come on. They wouldn't let a murderer be a high school teacher. They don't know. His files were sealed. All the research we've done points directly to him. - So, what are you gonna do? - I don't know. Don't do anything stupid, okay? Why don't you call that cop? That guy is almost about as big as an asshole as Grimaldi is. I'm kind of exposing myself. If there's one person I could kill, it would be Grimaldi. You know, it's getting late. We really should go. - What is this? - It's nothing. You tried to commit suicide? Why didn't you tell me? It's nothing I like to brag about, okay? - What-- I mean-- - I screwed it up. - The first time... - The first time? I swallowed a-- a bottle of pills. And then a month ago, I slit my wrists. And I screwed it up. Why? I just get depressed. And I don't have anyone to talk to. My parents are always out making money or something. It's not like I have all these friends. I'm not some pom-pom cheerleader. - So, this was all bullshit? - No, Casey-- You couldn't kill yourself, so you had to get me to do the job for you? All the research, the practice, you were just manipulating me to get what you wanted from me. You lied to me, Sasha. This whole thing was a lie! - Well, it was a lie at first-- - I trusted you! Yeah, “Let me be your first victim so I can become famous.“ I can't believe I listened to that bullshit! Casey, wait! - Ray, Ray... - Yeah? You are not gonna believe this. Rose Wyman was found dead in her room at the Palms nursing home this morning. Okay, that's sad, but guess who was the last person to see her? - I'm on it. - Ha! ( knock on door) -You're Mrs. Noland? - Yes. Detective Raymond Berro. A woman died in an old age home last night, and it seems that your son was the last person she spoke to. You can't possibly think that Casey could have something to do with that. Hey, looks like she died of a heart failure. But I still need to question your son. Grimaldi's got Sasha! Let's go! - Go where? - Where? I don't know-- his house. You think he takes girls to kill them at his mom's crappy little apartment? Where would he go? How the hell am I supposed to know? You're the one that did the research. - Casey: Shit! - He's not here. - He's probably at the neighbor's. - Which neighbor? - The Feldmans, next door. - Mm-hmm. All right. Umm... There was a guy named Beswick and he used to take his victims to the basement of his factory. - So? - The school! Go to the school! Hey, kids! I hope we're not too late. Shit! It's locked. Stand back. What the hell is that? C-4. I told you it'd come handy. - What? You carry it around with you? - Never leave home without it. You militia fuck! Is it “blue to red“ or “red to green“? ( laughs ) - ( clock rings) - Oh shit! Shit! -Amil! - Blue to yellow. It was blue to yellow. - It was awesome. - Probably got to get you to a hospital. No, no. I'm fine. - I'm fine. Just go save Sasha. - All right. ( gasping ) The office. - What happened, kid? - It was beautiful. Okay, I put about 350 pounds on here. - ( grunts ) -You know I'm gonna kill you later. But at least you'll have the firmest buttocks in the morgue. Well, well... if it isn't my favorite sissy boy, Casey Noland. What the hell happened to your southern accent? My southern accent? I just decided... to stop doing it. Take care now. Casey? Casey? Casey, what are you doing with all these tools? This ain't “Home Improvement,“ boy! Casey? Casey! Casey! Don't let me catch you! Casey. Did you fall down? You know, it's a shame I'm gonna have to kill you. I was looking forward to you being the first student ever to fail gymnasium class. I dug up the papers about your past. - Everybody's gonna find out about you. - Not if you're dead. - Put down the knife, Vince. - Ray! I am so happy you're here. You know, I caught the kid red-handed, and he tried to kill me. - He's full of shit. - Vince... I need you to put down the knife. No problem, Ray. You know me, law-abiding citizen, huh? - Casey: Look out! - Ah! Nothing personal, Ray. Ouch! Casey, did you say goodbye to detective Berro? Casey, stop. See, now that you've run away, I'm just gonna have to cut your heart out, show it to you and make a hand puppet, huh? Casey? Casey, you forgot to say good night to Detective Gurgling-on-his-own-blood. ( laughs ) Casey! Just show yourself, you idiot. You know I'm gonna find you. Case'! Well, you get an “A" for rope climbing skills, but an “F" for hiding places. You stupid imbecile, did you actually think I wouldn't see you hanging from a rope in the middle of a big, empty room? Get your ass down here. Casey! Get your ass down here! (coughing) I gotta hand it to you, Colombo. That was a pretty impressive detective work on your part. -You killed a cop. You're finished. - Oh, I'm finished? You think they actually are going to suspect their drinking buddy? You asshole! You're the one that's been bragging for two weeks that you wanna be a serial killer. Who do you think they're gonna believe? You could teach me how to be a serial killer. What!? Casey, you're a girl. You have to be a man to be a serial killer. I know everything. The bodies, you turn them into furniture. You depersonalize them-- inanimate objects. You wanna feel like you own these girls. Like-- like they're your possessions. Possessions? God damn it! You have completely bought into this touchy-feely horseshit that they're teaching you in psychotherapy. i don't want 'em as possessions. I'm just trying to rid society of some of its filth. That's all. Yeah, I took a shotgun and killed my grandmother and grandfather, but! was doing them a favor. And then I get sent off to a mental hospital, where they thought they could cure me. They didn't do a very good job. No, they didn't, 'cause I don't have a disease. I'm the one who's healthy. It's the rest of society that is diseased. Look at these girls in gym class... with their breasts bulging out and their tight little shorts on. They're just gonna grow up to be whores and sluts, and real estate agents. You've been rejected by girls your whole life. What teenage girl wants to be with some lame-ass gym teacher? First of all, fuck you. Second of all, this conversation is over, 'cause I'm gonna kill you now and turn you into a piece of furniture. ( saw whirring stops ) ( laughs ) You are so pathetic. You bring a power tool to kill your gym coach and you don't get good batteries? What do you intend to do with that? Scratch me to death? Huh? You can't throw it. You throw like a fucking girl! Not anymore. I had a damn fine gymnasium class coach. Good throw... bad catch. Sasha. It's over. Grimaldi's dead. Yeah. I'm all right. How about you? I'll be okay. Did he touch you? No, but he said he wanted to make me into a coffee table. After this, you still don't wanna kill yourself, do you? No. I don't think I'm cut off to be a serial killer. It doesn't matter. - What do you think? - This is so good. God, I wish your dad was here. He'd be so proud of you. So, ifl have a problem with Mr. Korn, you're gonna back me up? You bet. You're on the right track now, guy. Thanks, Mom. I love you, honey. I simulated the whole fetal pig dissection. It's totally interactive. Casey, this is great! I can use this in all my classes. So? I'm giving you an “A.“ It's great to see you take more interest in school. Killer. I believe the next individual to go up and speak would be Mr. Casey Noland. This should prove to be very interesting, Mr. Noland. Because your grade in this class hinges on this paper. My paper is entitled, “Serial Killing for Dummies.“ “A serial murderer is like a hunter, he must always be on the hunt, looking for the victim, the opportunity, who is most vulnerable. As an agent in the FBI's national center for analysis of violent crime, I will have to put myself in the position of a hunter of a serial offender. I've got to be able to profile my potential prey, determine what his next move is... ...detectives and crime scene analysts take a number of unrelated clues and turn them into a coherent narrative. They're telling a story that victims can no longer tell. As John Douglas explains, if you want to understand the artist, you must look at the paintings.“ That was fly, Mr. Noland. You got yourself an “A.“ Motherfucking kids! Killing the goddamned teachers. ( laughs ) Un-fucking-believable, yeah! And you know... who's gonna have to clean up this fucking shit, right? The head... fucking custodian, that's who, yeah. Fucking tater tots, and blood, blood, and tater tots. Jesus Christ! ( sighs ) I gotta see some titties later. I got titties on my mind here. Yeah, what do they care? What the fuck, huh? Sure, sure, sure. They just make fun of me, right? Make fun of the job. I'm just a dummy. “Look at the dummy clean it up. The dummy will clean it up.“ Yeah, well. Fuck them, huh? I'm gonna kill all those fuckers. Yeah. Yeah, serial killing, uh-huh. (laughs) Yeah, that's for dummies. ( laughing ) It's for dummies. ♫ Buried my own head ♫ ♫ Buried my own dead ♫ ♫ Buried my own brain ♫ ♫ And met her in there yesterday ♫ ♫ Hiding my own fears ♫ ♫ Hiding all these years ♫ ♫ Hiding my own brain ♫ ♫ And hiding my yesterday ♫ ♫ Whatlknow, yes, what i know: ♫ Can't you see l'm trying to believe in you? ♫ ♫ So please believe in me ♫ ♫ And what i am is what i am-- ♫ ♫ Burying my own head ♫ ♫ Well, truth are lies and lies are truth, so what do you believe? ♫ ♫ l'm trying to believe in you, so please believe in me ♫ ♫ And what i am is what i am, it ain't easy ♫ ♫ Burying my own head ♫ ♫ Bury, bury, bury, bury, bury, yeah ♫ ♫ And l'm hiding, hiding, hiding, hiding, hiding ♫ ♫ l'm buried: ♫ l'm buried, oh buried ♫ ♫ And I'm hiding ♫ ♫ l'm hiding, l'm hiding ♫ ♫ What i know is what i know ♫ ♫ Because you'll see l'm trying to believe in you ♫ ♫ So please believe in me ♫ ♫ And what i am is what i am, and it ain't easy ♫ ♫ And hiding my own-- ♫ ♫ Well, truth are lies and lies are truth, so know what you believe in ♫ ♫ l'm trying to believe in you, so please believe in me ♫ ♫ And what i am is what i am, and it ain't easy-- ♫ ♫ Bury, bury, bury, bury, bury, yeah ♫ ♫ And l'm hiding, hiding, hiding, hiding, hiding ♫ ♫ l'm buried: ♫ Buried, oh buried ♫ I And l'm hiding, l'm hiding... ♫ ( screams ) ♫ Buried my own head ♫ ♫ Buried my own head ♫ ♫ Buried my own head. ♫
