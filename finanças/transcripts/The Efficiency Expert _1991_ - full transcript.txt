I just can't see the union accepting a staff cut of this size. Four hundred and eighty workers, that's a quarter of their workforce. It's a quarter you don't need. The savings are on page 19 of the report. I suggest you take a long look at the amount, gentlemen. That's just our company's assessment of your position. You are, of course, at liberty to reject any of these recommendations. The Americans haven't signed yet. The sale is contingent upon a staff reduction. Yes, there is that, of course. As recommended by you? That's exactly right, boys. Have they seen this report? No. That'd be unethical. Friggin' old women! If they don't act, the Americans will pull out. Nothing surer! They're just giving themselves time to think, that's all. They'll think us right out of our commission. Our next client is a moccasin factory in Spotswood. Yes, they've been on our books for weeks. Ah, Jean? Could you ring this Mr. Ball and tell him I'll be at his factory at 9:15 a.m. on Monday? And then, um... Why don't you take the rest of the afternoon off, Jean? Thank you, Mr. Wallace. What's wrong with the old bat? Do you know where this Spotswood is? Oh, and Stewart flies past sad old Brabham! Where did you come from? Oh, it's where I'm going! Oh, you think you're smart, eh? Well, Brabham's coming up on the outside now! ...In the studio this morning, is Adam Park of the Melvin Marriage Guidance Counsel... Adam, I suppose there are various warning signs that a marriage is broken down. Well, often we don't realize our marriage is broken down. Do we? It can happen gradually. Often happens in the stage in life when one of the partners is very busy. Perhaps in a career. Oh! But he missed the turnoff! Stewart's got the lead again. What's wrong with Brabham back there? Stewart's well ahead. Brabham's pathetic. Brabham's utterly hopeless! Stewart! You big girl! Because here comes Death Corner! And you know what that means, Brabham fans? Stewart hasn't got the guts! If you're not getting home till all hours, there's a lot of pressure at work... And the crowd goes wild! He cannot be beaten! Ohh, except by the incredible Stewart, who the crowd loves even more than pencil-leg Brabham! Hey! Hey, that's not fair! I already won! It's time we did something about it. I genuinely think a lot of people have lost their way. ¶ Who wants to be A millionaire? ¶ ¶ I don't ¶ Hello? Uh, excuse me please, I'm looking for Mr. Ball's office. Mr. Ball's office? Now what would be your most direct route? I tell you what... down this corridor, then left after your third door. Thank you. You'll find two passages: One on your left, one on your right. Ignore them. They're not the ones you want. Your best bet would be the very next one on the right. Thank you. Or would it? Ah! Mr. Wallace! How do you do? An honor to have you here. Thank you. A real pleasure. Please, sit down. Thank you. Mrs. Ball's biscuits. Ah, tell Gordon to try a couple of stitches under the fold of the insole. Should solve the problem. Sorry, new line. Oh. So! Um, I've read your letter, Mr. Ball. Yes, I sent that. Um, you're aware of what we do, Mr. Ball? Ah, we are an independent consultancy providing an independent assessment of your business performance. Time and motions. Yeah, well that is a rather dated term. Ah, there are other elements of performance-orientated analysis, certainly, but we look at your whole operation, not just manufacturing, but, uh, your equity position, debt to equity ratio, market determinants, tax minimizations, the whole corporate picture. Right. Ah, we then make a series of recommendations which you are quite at liberty to accept or reject. At present, we are compiling a report for Durmacks, the country's second largest car component network. It's going very well. Really? Yes, um... so perhaps you could outline your problem for me. Mmm. Uh, Edna's offered you tea? Sorry? Ah, yes. Thank you. We've been in casual footwear for 38 years. I'm of the mind that we make the toughest-wearing moccasin in the southern hemisphere. Now, Mr. Wallace, I don't know if you're familiar with the moccasin. Obviously, you've got your casual or evening moccasin, of course, but also. Milk? A more sturdy and no-nonsense moccasin for outside wear. Yes, please, thank you. Then, naturally, you've got your different finishes. Anything from natural leather, right through to the "wet look." Although, to date... that hasn't been a big seller for us. Hmm. However, as I mentioned in my correspondence, which you have received, we're presently expanding into after-tea wear. After-tea wear? Uh, dressing gowns, nighties and so on... Oh, yes. Um, Mr. Wallace. We've had some great days. But frankly, it's time we started to look to the future. Oh, we've shown a healthy profit every year, but there's always room for improvement. I feel it's really a question of modernization. Do you agree, Mr. Wallace? Modernization? Uh, yes, modernization, possibly. Ah, sometimes it's more a question of reduction rather than expansion. Expand rather than reduce in our case, I would think! I'm on the opinion that a lot of people aren't aware of these things. I need to have access to all your books and records. Of course. All of them. I'll start with a look at your departments. Uh, of course. Uh, I will introduce you to everyone. Ah, no, please, I would prefer to remain anonymous. No, no, no, Mr. Wallace! You mustn't be shy around here. Everybody's dying to meet you. Right now they're having morning tea. Uh, Anzac? A bit of a worry, that car of yours, Gordon. Hi, Dad. I've never been happy with the Maserati. You were late again this morning, son. Maybe it's your tires? There's nothing wrong with the tires. The worry is, I don't think this body's ever meant to carry such a big motor. I don't like the look of these brushes. Excuse me. Can I please have your attention? Excuse me, Mr. Ball. Can you sign this? What is it, Win? It's a going away card for Jamie Ericson. It can wait. But he's leaving this afternoon. See me about it afterwards! Ericson? He's only been here 3 weeks! Uh, I have the honor of introducing Mr. Errol Wallace of Tynan and McGregor, Commercial Consultants. Mr. Wallace will be visiting us over the course of the next week or so... to offer his wisdom regarding the general updating and modernization of Ball moccasins. Y-yes, Kevin. Ah, I'd just like to say, while we got Mr. Wallace here, that we need some new steps down in dispatch. - Yeah. - Yeah, we do. Thank you, Kevin. We'll all get the opportunity of speaking to Mr. Wallace later on. In greater depth. In the meantime, would you please make Mr. Wallace warmly welcome. And while you have your hands together, I'd like you to welcome my youngest daughter, Cheryl. Cheryl is coming to work with us here for a little while before embarking on a full-time modeling career. Thank you and enjoy your break. She looks like she could be a model though, doesn't she? I think she's got her father's legs, quite frankly. Yes, yes, I like the line of that a lot. Does it feel comfortable, Edna? Plenty of room across the shoulders? Feels good. Lovely, lovely. Ah, these can't be the, uh... Ah, the complete financial records, Mr. Ball, surely? As far as I know, they are. Just turn around once more, would you, Edna? Oh, it's beautiful. It's really beautiful. Yeah, ah, I would like to get into this today, if that's possible? See if he's here, Edna. I've got just the man to take you to the very heart of things. Cut the red tape, so to speak. Ah, Mr. Wallace. We meet again. Now I thought we'd start with the Sticking Room. What would be the quickest way, I wonder? And her neck got caught in the back axle and she got dragged three miles. But my mate who was driving, the bus stopped, because he reckoned it sounded like his universal. Oh, she was dead and that, the funny thing was, he was right in the first place. His universal was gone! Ah, can you take this down to dispatch for me? I don't work in the office, I work in the shop. I don't really care. Just do it. Working on the roof of a block of flats... he slipped and fell nine stories dead square on his head. He lived, but what they had to do was surgically insert all these steel plates in his skull. He reckons, the doctors reckon, if ever he goes near a magnet, he gets these really serious headaches. Yeah, sure. I got a better one. This other fella I knew, went swimming, got hit by a speedboat, got his arm chopped off. Well, they rushed him to the hospital. His mates found the arm and stuck it in the ice box. When they got to the hospital, it was the wrong ice box. It was full of beer! Is there something I can do for you, Carey? Yeah, um... Yeah, I'm looking for Win. Well, he's not in here. Didn't you just pass him in the corridor? Don't you think I would've noticed if I had? Well, you mightn't have, Carey, if he wasn't wearing a short pink dress and a nice gold belt. Yeah, good. Thanks. All our machinery is up to date, as you can see, and all made in Australia. Mr. Wallace? And from the machine room, the young moccasin travels via the concourse, which you've already seen, into this area, our Sticking Department, where the ladies stick the insole to the outer skin. All highly-skilled craftswomen. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Wallace, with regards to the modernization. We've been looking through some paint charts, we've marked the colors we liked. Now we think we prefer the chantelle to the mediocre colors... I don't think you quite understand what I'm doing here. I'm not an interior designer. Oh, don't worry. You don't have to make up your mind now. Just take a look. Ah, this way... We had exactly the same opportunity in '66 but we lacked the mental discipline. Now we've got barely two weeks to make ourselves into one supreme racing machine. If we win this, we're state champions. If we lose, we're nobodies! That's how important it is. Ron? Mr. Wallace would like to see your dispatch book. Can do. I thought I might leave a bit early today, pick up a new front end. Yeah, right. I ought to knock off a bit early myself. I've got a lot of hard thinking to do about the correct driving order. Ah, no. I'd like to see your records for the last five years. That's them! I've got small handwriting. I got them all to fit into one book. Oh, could you put my eye drops in please, Mr. Spencer? Of course, Win. Two in each eye. Allergic to sheepskin. Why does he work here? It's where his future is. Tea break! Okey-doke. Afternoon tea? Mr. Wallace? So... have you spoken to that Cheryl yet? Yeah, I've bumped into her. But did you talk to her? Yeah! Well, what did she say? Oh, nothing specific. Carey... What? Well, where are we going? You'll see! Wendy! Do you think she actually looks like a model, though? Who? Cheryl. Hmm, possibly. She's got big hands, though, hasn't she? Has she? Oh, you know something about her? How many birds do you reckon are over there? Do you know what she does on the weekends? Do you? Did I tell you I spent some time with that Mr. Wallace today? Oh, yeah? What did he say? I think he was very impressed. Oh, hello. Did you have a good day? I've made you a meal. How's this new place? Oh, it's strange. It's like visiting my grandfather's house and finding it full of people. Huh! Hello? G'day, Carol. It's Jerry. Is the boss there? Yes, he is here. It's Jerry. The, uh, owner of the factory gave me those. Errol? Hi, Jerry. Can you get over to Durmacks, the whole thing is blowing up in our face. No. How? That's what we got to find out. Can you get over there? Crikey, yeah. Well, you better get going. All right, I'll be out straight away. Sorry to break up your romantic little dinner. Yeah. Go on, get in there now! - Get him! Get him! - Don't let him through! - Turn around. - There's a side gate. What the heck's happening? Well, old son. I don't think we're too popular here. Your report's been leaked to the union. Who leaked it? Don't ask me. Who leaked the report? God knows! But there's 10 copies of the thing floating around. Come on. Morning dew, yeah. Three foot nine... three foot six. What are you doing? I have to measure the whole house. School project. I'm trying to concentrate. Get out. I'll be quiet. Good. Who's Cheryl? No one you'd know. A model. I wake up with the sun bright and new, I listen to the sun and the early morning dew. Dew doesn't make any noise. What? Look, it's my poem, I can write what I like. Just trying to help. If I was you, I'd stick to drawing. But dew doesn't... I don't care! I'm not interested. I just finished this book called Animal Farm, about these animals that take over the whole world... Did you? Did you? Get out! I'm glad our dog died. Hope I can keep my form for the state finals. Probably wouldn't make much difference. Who are you going to take to the club fundraiser? I think I might take Cheryl. - You haven't got a chance. - I'm taking Shirley. Shirley? Oh-huh, red hot, red hot. I met her a couple of weeks ago. I ran over her cat. And she's going out with you? I don't know. I haven't asked her yet. I'm sure she'd jump at the chance. Hey, go left! Oh, you can't help an accident... It was an old cat. Well, did you kill it? I don't think I did it any good. Hey! Hey! That's Cheryl! That's Cheryl in the car. That's Cheryl in the car with Kim! What she doing with that suck? What did I tell you? Sales staff. Looks too much like her old man anyway. Never go out with a woman if you know how she's gonna end up looking. Hey, Win! Win, you dickhead! Turn left! Cheryl doesn't look anything like Mr. Ball. Well, she doesn't now. Give her a couple of years and she will. Have you seen the size of his feet? One of Australia's bigger companies, Durmack Proprietor Limited, with rumors of a foreign take-over and the dismissal of 1000 workers. Union leaders have been quick to react to this leaked report. Now this dinner dance on Saturday night's vital. We've gotta raise some funds if we're gonna make a proper showing for the Grand Prix. Wendy's Roneo'd off 800 of these fliers, boys... Carey, you make sure you distribute those all around the local area. Everywhere. Oh. I'm counting on you! Yeah, all right. No worries. I'll get it. Win? Fletcher? - Hello? - Yeah, what is it, Gordon? Not you, Kevin. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Yes, hello. Um, this is Cheryl, in the main office. This is Carey in the Skin Room. Um, is Mr. Wallace there please, Carey? Hang on, I'll just check. Have you seen Doctor Zhivago? No, Mr. Wallace. Oh, I was going to go if you felt like coming along. Oh, I think I've got a crossed line here. I might try the Machine Room. Mm-hmm. Oi! No, no, no. It's for me. Hello? Ah, no sight of him in here either. Look, who is this? This is Carey. From the... From the Skin Room. We were just talking. What? I'm looking for Mr. Wallace. Oh, well, hold on, hold on. I'll just see if he's in here, all right. One minute... No, it's okay. No, it's fine. I'll try dispatch. Oh, all right! This is Cheryl in the main office. I'll get it! I'll get it! Hello? Hello, is this Mr. Wallace? Yes. Ah, Mr. Wallace, Mr. Fish wants you to call him. You mean, Mr. Finn? Right. Thank you. Um, is there a phone around here? Yeah, yeah. There's one right up in the office. I'll take you there. Isn't there one in there? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll only be a tick. - Um... - Hello? Hello, Shirley? Yes? Oh, this is Frank here. Who? Well, Frank Fletcher. I ran over your cat a couple of weeks ago, remember? Excuse me... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll only be a minute. Gordon? Have you got today's crossword? Mr. Wallace? Is there another phone around here? There should be one around the corner here, I think. I'm Kim Barrett, by the way. Sales. Oh, hello. So, uh, what do you make of this operation? A bit of a dog, eh? What? Most of the blokes here are "a shrimp short of the barbeque" at the very least. Durmacks? Ah, Jerry Finn, please. Line's busy. Can you hold? Yes, I'll wait. The slot car capital of the world. Hmm? Grown men playing with toy cars. Where? Oh. Jerry Finn. Hello, Jerry? I was wonder... Oh, Errol. Those figures you did on start production... Excuse me. The board's called a meeting... Yes, what sort of extraordinary meeting? They want to go through the report with the union. I see. It'll be another long meeting. All right, I'll meet you there tonight. You better tell your wife. Yes, I will. Right. I was actually wondering if we can get together for lunch? Perhaps? Well, what did you say your name was? Kim. Kim Barrett. Sales. Kim. Sales. I see. Very good to meet you. Kev, turn your hearing aid on! One of the worst ways of going is an electric shock. This other fella I knew, went to open his fridge and was blown 45 foot across the room, into a glass cabinet, and ended up with a dinner plate embedded in the back of his head through his brain! Ah! Uh, Carey... Yeah? Could I have a word with you, please? Yes, Mr. Wallace. Carey, I'm looking for a keen young fellow, like yourself, to help me. It'd be a bit of a promotion for you and plenty of overtime. Are you interested? Ah, no, I think I'm a bit busy. Well, you'd be time-keeping, monitoring output, keeping an eye on everyone pulling their weight, helping me with my report. Oh, I can't type or anything like that. No, no. You wouldn't have to type. Mr. Ball's daughter will be working with us. Cheryl? Yes. Would I be working with Cheryl? Yes, with Cheryl and myself. Just the three of us. You'd get a desk to yourself. Oh, no, I don't mind sharing with Cheryl. Good! So you are interested? Yeah, yeah. I'll do it. Overtime, that's great. Well, um... I won't eat my lunch, I'll just come straight up, huh? No, we don't need you until tomorrow. Well, I'll eat my lunch, then. Been a while since Spotswood had a chance at the state finals. It'll be a big day. Especially for your Uncle Gordon. Have you been practicing? No, I didn't think I needed to. Oh. You know, you should be very proud of yourself, son. If someone as clever as Mr. Wallace takes you under his wing, it's a step in the right direction. There's a vacancy coming up in the Machine Room next month. Why don't you ask Mr. Wallace about that? You'd be in an ideal position. Yeah, I was thinking about being a salesman or management. Well, not a bad idea. But you don't want to get ahead of yourself, son. What about something on the floor? Yeah, I could see you heading Dispatch one day. Thought we'd surprise you. Your Uncle Gordon and Aunty Gwen have got something for you. We thought our young new executive should look the part. Used to belong to Geoff. We haven't known what to do with it. Going to a good cause now though, eh? Shh! Shh! Gordon Baxter. New suit? You look nice. Yeah, it's new. It's a bit wet. Can you give this to Mr. Ball, please? Mmm-hmm. Sure. Doesn't matter. Um, what's this? Carey's been promoted! Uh, I'm Carey. We spoke on the intercom yesterday. Well, we have to share a desk. Mr. Wallace said. Hi. Hi. He said... He said we're gonna Excuse me. Have to work closely together. Good luck. So... Carey, Uh, um... could you come here, please? Oh, um... Good morning. Cup of tea? No, thank you. Morning, Edna. Ah, Carey. Ah, listen, I'm instituting some changes here and I'll be needing you to assist me. I've chosen you, Carey, because I think you've got the right attitude. You could have quite a future if you set your mind to it. Yeah? Yes. Now, look, what I want you to do is very important. Have you ever seen or studied the inside of a clock? All the components are reliant on the others, but some play a bigger role, and some a smaller. But the mechanism does not function unless all the parts are working. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes. Good. Our job is to make sure all the parts that go to make up Balls are performing to the best of their ability. Right. Going to have to keep your wits about you, though. Sometimes people resent change. So you're going to have to put aside some of your friendships for the time being, I'm afraid. And, um... fill these forms in as accurately as you can. Okay? Any questions? Mmm. Can I go back to the office later? More, more, right. One of the first laws of industry, reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between employees. And the girls won't mind? Oh, no! You'll find they'll appreciate the lack of distraction... after awhile. Now, this should overcome your delay problems in dispatch, Mr. Ball. Save you a bit of effort, eh, Kevin? Yeah, if you say so, Mr. Ball. Just like Nancy Sinatra. It was really good. And so they put me in this spotted dress... Right, I've staggered the lunch hour into three separate shifts, 12, 12:30, and 1, and removed a couple of the tables. Because there is a tendency when you have a large group of people for conversation to eat into production time. Oh? Ah, these changes, of course, are very minor. Um, I want to spend the next few days going over the financial side of your business. All right? Carey? Rose? Rose, can you hear me? Is that as fast as you can do it? I don't know, I've never thought about it. Please do it again. No, Carey. But you have to. It says so right here. Now we're all set for the dinner dance? Everyone knows what's expected of him? Yeah, right, Gordon. Right. Ah, our young new executive. Are you all right, Carey? Um, would you mind starting work so I can time what you're doing? Do you mind? Win! Yeah, what? Take this letter to Mr. Ball. Tell him it's from Gordon, immediately. But I'm going the opposite way! I don't care. I work for Mr. Wallace, now take it. No, I'm going for a kick. Win! I'll take it. Tell him it's from Gordon! From Gordon, all right? Carey, can you come with me? Are these discounted moccasins last year's range, Carey? Oh, no, they're this year's. Are we going inside? No, I don't think so. Do you think you have to be funny with women? What? Witty. Do you think women only like witty guys? No. I think they like other things too. Like what? Money? I don't want to go to some toy car dance. I made a date, Daddy, with Kim. The letter is signed by Gordon. He wishes us to be his special guests, and I'll be dashed if I'm going to let him down. Well, you go. He specifically asked that you attend. The letter mentions your name several times, see? There, there, there. At least make an appearance. I'm having my lunch downstairs. I suppose they'll want some sort of speech. Take your serviette off. It's a cravat. It looks like a serviette. But it's not a serviette. See, it's got patterns on... Will you take it off? Nobody likes to see things hanging round people's necks. It makes you look like an infant. Now, we're picking up Shirley first. I lined you up with her friend. No, you can't. I've got a date. I'm meeting Cheryl. And did you tell Cheryl? Yeah. Well, just ditch the ugliest one when you get there. That's what I'd do. Now, this girl's supposed to look a little bit like Elizabeth Taylor. In Cleopatra or National Velvet? Huh? Hey, look out for cats, will you? Which one's yours? The one on the left. I think. Don't you know? I didn't take that good a look. It was dark. Shirley! Oh, thank Christ, it's the good looking one. Hurry up and get in the back. - Have a nice time. - You boys be careful too. Hey, do we all have to sit in the front? There's somebody in the back. Ta-ta! We've been working here for here 20 years. A lot of these people, it's the only place they ever worked! Are you coming into this meeting? These thousand retrenchments they're talking about on the radio. Where did that come from? What? It was you who leaked the report, wasn't it, Jerry? Hmm? I didn't recommend a thousand retrenchments. I recommended 480, maximum. But you've blown the figure up, haven't you? You leak it to the press, the union hits the panic button. Then in a weeks time you'll go into some sort of a crisis meeting and appear to back down to a figure of say, what, 480? Isn't that right, Jerry? Guilty, Your Honor. Well, someone had to push the pace. Durmacks weren't going to confront the problem and we'd lose our commission. We may end up losing a lot more than our commissions. Look, someone's always going to lose out. The trick is to make sure it's not us. Thank you. Oh, come on, sunshine. Just back me up in this meeting, will you? Come on. Carey. Are you sure you sent out all those handbills, son? Mm-hmm. That'll be a dollar each, please. Uh, we're the special guests. Robert? Listen, is this bloke Wallace the full load? I mean, what's his point about eating in three shifts? There's plenty of tables. I'm sure he knows what he's doing. Apparently Bob's not allowed to take the shop van home at night. I was under the impression it was Bob's van in the first place. I was thinking of asking Cheryl to dinner. I wouldn't. Mr. Ball. Didn't know they were coming. Stick to the pictures, cut your talking time down. Mr. Ball. Robert. What a pleasure. Thank you. You know Lorna? Yes. And you've met Cheryl, of course. Many times. When would you like me to speak? Uh, well, anytime. Uh, feel free to speak anytime. We don't stand on ceremony around here. Well, I wouldn't want to speak out of turn or anything. You know how it can be sometimes. Please, speak whenever you feel the urge, Mr. Ball. I'll wait for a few minutes then. See this gear, here? It's worn. It's got to be replaced before the race. I will speak now, Robert. Righto, Mr. Ball. Excuse me. May I have your attention please? Welcome friends and enthusiasts, to the Spotswood 124th-scale Slot Car Club. I have the very great pleasure tonight of saying a few words, and that will be a blessing to some of you, about slot-car racing. As a local captain of industry, I'm often called upon to speak at such evenings as this, but I must tell you, in all honesty, it's rare I've seen a spread as good as this one. Oh, hi, Cheryl. Hi. What do you think of Julie Andrews? Pardon? She's supposed to be good in The Sound of Music. Oh, yeah. It's on at the Grand on Monday night. Think you'll be going? Oh, I don't know, I might. Yeah, I guess I will. Yeah. Me too. Oh, we'll both be going then. Uh, hey, do you think we should go together? Now that we're fellow work mates and stuff? Uh... Um... I can't. Um, thanks for asking though. Oh, another night? Any night's all right with me. Um, I've got to go, Carey, 'cause I'm meeting someone. Oh, yeah. No. Yeah. It's been nice talking to you tough. Yes? G'day. Kim. Kim Barrett from Ball's sales. Yes. Um, I wonder if I could have a few minutes of your time. You recommending that Ball closes the place down? Not while they're making a profit, certainly not. Profit, ha. Bullshit. Old man Ball hasn't made a real profit for years. He's just been selling off his assets. What is this? That's a, uh, complete company ledger. See, old man Ball used to own the whole block. When things started going wrong, he started flogging it off. That's what he calls a profit. The only reason we got paid last year was 'cause he sold the place next door. Mr. Ball wouldn't just give you this. Well, you can't wait for people to give you everything. So you just took it? I'm going to take over the company one day. Sack all the loonies, start importing cheap shit from Asia. That's where the money is. Now, your report could be my ticket in. And prepare yourselves for the great battle ahead. And so, in conclusion, I can but wish Gordon and his team the very best of luck in this most prestigious event, the 124th Slot Car Grand Prix. Very well done, dear. Yes, well, I think they warmed to me. Bit worried at the start though. Can you take me home, please? I thought you were being picked up. I'll drop you off here, save me driving down. See you, then. See you, Gary. It's Carey. Hi, Carey. Hi. What are you doing? Catching snails. If you find enough of them, you can make a flying potion out of the shells. Oh, yeah? Oh, found one. So you reckon this will make you fly? Yep. Mmm. Oh, found another. What are you really going to do with it? Put it in the jar. Going to eat it? Ahh! I told you! Wendy? What are you doing out here? Who's that? Who's that out there with you? Is that a man? No, it's just me, Mr. Robinson. Carey. Carey? Carey. Oh, that's all right, then. I thought it was a man. No, just me. Come on, girl. Come in here. What do you think this is, a bloody circus? Come on! Wendy? Are you riding to work on Monday? I'll pick you up, then. Is this to do with Durmacks? Yes. Are you satisfied? All right. I'll call the police. - For Christ's sake. - You don't care about me. Of course I care about you! No, you don't! I had something to do on Saturday night. Yeah, you were supposed to be with me! I know you were with someone else, you're just too immature to tell me. Cheryl, all right, I was with Wallace talking business. Hi, Carey. Hi. How'd you finish up Saturday night? Good. Good. Sorry I couldn't stay. I had something really silly to do. Mmm. So are we still all right for pictures? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, sure, n-no, that'd... Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. Me... Me too. Yeah. Thanks. You're dead mate. I mean dead. Really dead. Dead, dead! I am going to knock you right out! - No! - Kim. There's a phone call for you. Where? Thank you. Easy, Ron, easy. It's more useful out here, I reckon. Yeah, I think you're right, Kev. G'day, Mr. Wallace. Oh, morning, Mr. Wallace. Morning, Mr. Wallace. This was a good idea of yours, Mr. Wallace. Easy, now. Now watch yourself! Any twins in the family, love? Oh, my cousin had twins, you know. They each came out different ways. One was in a sort of breached... Oh, we couldn't hear each other speak the other way! Do you think we upset him? Nah. Completely hopeless, Mr. Ball. The women have totally ignored my partitions. It's the same with the roller. The men are using it to move somebody's car engine! As for lunch, it's supposed to be three separate half-hour sittings, not one 90-minute Bacchanalian feast! They're using you, Mr. Ball. Can't you see that? No. I'm sorry, but I don't agree. Now, look here. If you're not happy with my work, I can be out of here in 10 minutes flat. Oh, no, Mr. Wallace. Why didn't you tell me you were in a loss situation? Well, I'm not. It's just... You've been selling off your assets, haven't you? Year by year, till you've got nothing left to sell! You haven't made a real profit since 1963. I didn't mean to keep it a secret. You're in a dire situation, Mr. Ball, and you know it. The sort of changes I've been introducing here won't help your present situation one iota. I was... I was hoping modernization. Yes. Now look, I've got two days left here to redraw the whole strategy. But I'm going to need your complete cooperation. You're going to have to get ready to take some very hard decisions. Hello, Gordon. How are you, mate? Sorry to butt in, Mr. Ball. What is it, Gordon? We just put the motor back in your car. Want to have a look? I haven't got time for that now. Tell young Carey to come up and see me. Yeah, right. Hey, Gordon, have a word, eh? Uh, look, you just better keep an eye on Carey, mate. Ball's got him telling tales on you lot. He's working for Mr. Wallace. Straight to Ball, mate. Straight to Ball. Yes, Wendy? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. It has been brought to my notice that many of you have been abusing the new lunch-hour roster system. Now, these new changes I expect to be honored. If you have any questions about them, you can ask Carey. Now, those of you who shouldn't be here, please return to your own departments. The rest continue eating, please. Sorry. Sorry, Mr. Ball. Sorry, Mr. Ball. Sorry, Mr. Ball. Sorry. Just wasn't thinking, I suppose. Thanks a lot, Carey. See you! Hey, see you, Win! See you, Kev! See you, Ron. Oh. I let your tires down. Don't worry 'bout them, son. They'll soon get used to it. Just wait. We're not going to lie down and watch while a thousand of our members go on the dole queue. Listen, the easiest thing for us to do would be to shut the whole place down, and none of you would have a job! Now, hang on for a moment. Guys, does it have to be a thousand jobs? I mean, surely there's a compromise here? Excuse me, please. Is he coming back? Robert. Gordon. They'd have to go too. I'd be losing 60 percent of my people. The Asians can do it for half the price. Importing is the future. You simply cannot afford to be in manufacturing. But we must. People need to make things. We can't just import everything. You've been a very kind employer, Mr. Ball, but I'm afraid your people have let you down. They haven't paid you back in kind. No. You're wrong. You don't understand, you never could. With respect, Mr. Wallace, they've paid me back double. Triple. If you'd been here when the place was busy, you'd have seen them working day and night. No overtime. They did it because they believed in the place, and they trusted me. It's not their fault. I won't have that. No, it's your fault. You haven't helped these people, letting them live in a fool's paradise. And what did you think was going to happen in 18 months' time when you... When you run out of money? You can't see past the dollars and cents, can you? Work isn't just about money, Mr. Wallace. It's about dignity. It's about treating people with respect. Mr. Ball, if you want to save any part of this operation, I advise you to act immediately. I'm very sorry. I might wait for a week or so. Please have Carey's figures ready by tomorrow morning, 9:00. Yes, Mr. Wallace. Good. I need three copies of that. Um... Ah, Carey. Thank you very much. You're all finished here now. You can go back to dispatch or wherever you were before. Incidentally, Carey, you've done very well. Thank you for all your help. Goodbye. Look out, Fletch, I'm on you, mate! Get out of my way, Win! What a kick! Pass it over here, mate! Give me the ball, Win! Bloody hell. Car trouble, Mr. Wallace? Uh, yes, blasted thing. They can make you mad, can't they? Oh, Ron, Gordon, Kev! What's all this? Uh, vandals. Vandals. Take a look at this. - Look at those leads. - They're almost cut through. A wonder it ran at all. I'm surprised it ran. Yeah, wonder it went. Uh, is there a garage I could call? Oh, you don't need a garage. Nah, we'll do it. Just needs a bit of re-wiring. No, please, I've got an appointment on the other side of town. Tell you what, I'm on a break. I'll run you over. No, no, it would be out of your way. I'll grab a taxi. Looks like someone's been in here with a hammer! Mine, mine. Yours. Hi. Hi. What are you doing? I thought it needed a bit of a clean-up. The Sound of Music is coming on at the Grand. Do you want to go? Yeah, I suppose. Yeah? Except I think I'm already going. Okay. But I could go twice. Wendy? You'll be right with Ron. He's a natural with cars. Ever raced slot cars, Mr. Wallace? Uh, no, I had a train set when I was a kid. By the way, I've been meaning to thank you. For taking young Carey under your wing. Been a little worried about him finding his niche in the company. Surely you don't expect him to spend his whole life there, do you? Oh, well, I can think of worse things. Good people, good boss, good product. Oh, I know we're a little out of touch with the outside world sometimes, but, from what I've seen of it, we're not missing much. No, Pheeli wanted him to carry on at school, but he's always been a bit of a dreamer. Nice to have another breadwinner in the family, anyway. Oh, so you're thinking of retiring then? Oh, no, not yet. Had a little heart trouble, but nothing to worry about. You've got a couple sons, haven't you? Most important thing in the world, I reckon. What age are your lads? Don't start till I say. Right. Ahhh! Thank you very much. Well, it's been nice having you aboard, mate. I didn't realize you were leaving so soon. Yes, that's it. I had hope it'd be more permanent. Oh, well that's the way it is. Tell you what. When you come and pick your car on Monday, drop in and have a drink with us. Yes, I'll do that, thank you. Good on you, mate. We've beaten them. We've beaten the bastards. The Union caved in this afternoon. They've agreed to lose 500 workers. We won! Come on, please, Julian! Please stay, Caroline. At least until we can talk. Stay a couple of days. You could come with me to this cocktail party for Durmack's. Ah, the real reason. So I can be the loving wife to the Americans. No, that's not what I meant. I just thought we could go out together. I think it's a little past that, Errol. I'll call you in a few days. I'll be in the car outside, Julian. There's a group of men outside. They're just standing there. Are they from Durmacks? Go up to Julian's room. Lock the door. Where's the axe handle? It's in the garage. Get me something heavy. A piece of wood, anything. Oh, Mr. Wallace, you're up! Yeah. We weren't sure whether to ring the bell or not. What do you want? Well, it's about Ron's thumb, actually. It's my accelerator thumb. He broke it fixing your car. Kev, makes no difference where it happened. The point is, it couldn't have come at a worse time. Today's our state finals. We don't want to put you on the spot, but we're wondering if you'd be interested in being our sixth. Sorry, sixth what? Driver. I mean, Robert here's been telling me how you've had some experience with trains. Well, slot cars are similar. It's just you use more of a pushing action than a twisting action. Yeah. I'm sorry, I've, um... I've got a very important appointment later on. Understand completely. Yeah, of course. It was just a thought. Sorry to have bothered you. Yes, I'm sorry too. How do you do? I'm afraid Ron's thumb's held things up on your car. Won't be ready till Monday afternoon, if that's all right. Course, it gives Gordon's nephew time to fix up that paint job of yours. Yeah. Hey, uh... Uh, this race... Will it take very long? Everyone stand by please. This is the big one, mate, the big one. We're going to take home the big prize this time. You're not nervous, are you? Corner officials, stand by. Those used to be my farm yard animals. Have you read Animal Farm? Yeah. I didn't think so. Over here, Mr. Wallace. Now that's ours. That's the Ball's one. Number three, the green car. Ready? Time! Marshall! Don't worry about Carey. He always does this. - Don't worry! - You'll get it back! Pull your finger in, Carey! He'll make it up. Yes, yes! He's got one! Come on, Carey! Your main worry is that bloke from Little Piggy's Hams and Small Goods. That black roadster shouldn't be allowed on the track. Robert, go! Oh, that's the relay line. Hey, Wendy! Have you seen Carey's new girlfriend? Who says she's his girlfriend? Carey. He reckons they're going steady. Oi, Win! Get that flea-bitten dog out of here. What's wrong with him? Just get him out. - Take it easy, Punch. - Take it easy, mate. Keep that relay line clear. Time! Come on. Hurry it up, lad! Hurry it up. Come on, Dad. Quick. Sorry, sorry! You stepped on his toe. Come on, Robert! Go! Relax that thumb, Robert. You useless, young idiot. Come on! Dad! Dad! Come on, Dad! - That's the way! - That's the way! Yes! Yes! - That's it, Dad! - That's it, Dad! Keep it up! - Too good! - Too good for them, Bob! Time! Go, Robert! Go! Go! We need you to officiate. Move it down the straight! Come on, take him! Come, come, come, come, come on! Gordon! Come on, Gordon! Now, our job as officials is to pick them up as they come off. We obviously have to be fair, but the main thing is to keep the race going. Oh, there's one! No, other way. Up here. Up here. Other way! Up here. Don't panic. What? Don't panic. Watch the cars. Don't panic, yes. But don't panic. Well done, Kev. Nice and steady, eh? Take him, Kevin! Take him! Yes, good lad. That's your big worry. You come off in the tunnel, - it could cost you a minute. - Yes, and they have to reach in and pull you out, is that right? Yes, but you don't have to worry about that now. We're 12 laps ahead. Oh, good. Gonna have plenty of time to get the feel. Twelve laps? Just get yourself ready, Mr. Wallace. Yes. Errol. Everyone call me Errol, please. Okay, well, Errol, just get your jacket on. - What do we do now? - Don't worry. That's it! Kev, style! Kev, style! Okay, let's go. Go, Kev, go! Go, Kev, go! - Come on, Kevin. - Hold that lead, son. Good boy, Kev. Time! Go now, Mr. Wallace! Go! Go! Okay, Errol! Yes, Errol! Move it! Move it! Now take your time. Go a bit faster! He's not bad. Just a little faster now. Okay, just pick it up. Pick it up, gently. More of a train driver, really. How many to go? Four, but we're still one up. Carey, come on, hurry up! Come on, hurry up! I'm sorry! I'm afraid it's all over. Cars off! Cars off! Come on! Three to go. Go, Mr. Wallace! Come on, Errol! Stay there. Go, Errol, go! Who's Errol? Keep the pace up now, Errol. - Good stuff! - The roadster. Don't worry about the black one. Just stick with him. Stick with him. Stick with him like glue! Oh, no, not the tunnel! Slow down! The tunnel! The tunnel! I've got him! I've got him! I've got him worked out! Oh, no! We've won! We bloody well won! Errol, you bloody ripper! Yeah, mate, the way you came around that top bend, I've never ever seen anything like it, Errol. I was getting the knack of it in the end, I think. I tell you what, you've made Gordon a very happy man. Oh, good. We haven't had a win since 1961 when young Geoff was driving. And who's Geoff? Gordon's boy. Lost him in '64. Terrific kid. Errol, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. What's the secrets towards running a successful business these days? There are three rules to making a business work today, Kevin. Minimize initial production outlay, maximize stock output, make sure your product is situated correctly, be flexible to market trends... I suppose parking would be something to think about too. Yes. Yes. But do you realize that 50 percent of the companies set up today won't be in business this time next year? Fifty percent. Can you imagine that? It's unbelievable, isn't it? You don't want to hear all this though. Surely, not now. On the contrary. No, I'm interested. Gordon'll be interested in this. Gordon! Hurry up! Errol's telling us all about business. Dry argument too, Gordy. Yeah, come on. You wanted to ask me about business and the three rules. Right. You don't want to hear that. Balls! Cheers! Balls! Balls! Hey, Wendy! Wendy, we won the state finals. Where were you? Caroline? Caroline? Caroline, are you there? Ah, you haven't gone. No, I thought I'd stay till after the cocktail party. I owe you that. No. You don't owe me anything. Hey, you missed a great afternoon. Look what I won. We're state champions. Aren't these the men that are getting laid off? Yeah. Hi, Wendy. Hi, Dad. Hope you haven't been whispering in Mr. Ball's ear again, Carey. Leave him alone now, Ron. My guess is they called this meeting to straighten out the lunch muck-up. People can't eat in shifts. As you know... As you know, Mr. Wallace has been compiling a report on our company. I'm afraid that it's not all that it could be. I've known you all for 30 years. Well, not all of you, but... So what I am about to say is going to be rather... Is very sad for me. Thank you. Jeez, you're game, aren't you, mate? What? Old man Ball, he's just laid off half the staff. They're coming out now. He wasn't going to tell them for another week. Well, he did. Listen, further to our little chat about my ideas for the place. Could we get together for another hour? I'm very busy. What about lunch tomorrow? There's a nice restaurant round the bridge... Yes, yes! All right. 12:30? Fine. See you then. We gonna starve? Marvin. You going out? Yeah. You look very nice. Thanks. See you. See you, Dad. Sorry. At least Carey's still got a job. Errol, I'd like you to meet. Amos Lang, Consec Chemicals. I've just been telling Amos about that shoe factory you're winding up in Spotswood. Consec have got a bit... How do you know what I'm recommending, Jerry? Read your report. Very interesting stuff. You've got no right to telling him or anyone else. It is not public knowledge. Amos is in a position to buy the thing. I don't care if he's in a position to swan dive into a vat of his own insecticide. The place is not for sale and you've got no bloody right discussing it with anyone! Do you understand? Excuse me, Jerry. What are you trying to do to me? We're on the same side. No, we're not on the same side. No, we're not. Are you pissed? No. You picked a bloody great time. You all right? Yes, I'm fine. These people have flown in from America. They don't want to hear your mid-life crisis. We've done a good job... Tell me something! Did you ever talk to any of these 500 people we've put out of work? Did you ever find out how many kids they had? Or what they do in their spare time? Or if they ever raced slot cars? Caroline, can you drive me home, please, before I thump this... man. We're not on the same side. You're going to try to save a moccasin factory? I don't know, but maybe I can save its dignity. Oh, well. Here we are. Mr. Wallace. Ah, might I have a word? This is my wife, Caroline. How do you do? It is rather late, Mr. Wallace. I think we've said all that needs to be said. Well, I may have been wrong about the factory. It may not be necessary to sack everyone. This is a big about-change. Yes, I know. I've had time to reconsider. There are other approaches, possibly not foolproof, but, um... Your figures, all the work you've done. You're quite sure about all this? Well, to be honest, Mr. Ball, I don't think your place works on standard economic lines. You see, the sort of help I'm offering you, I don't think you need. Oh, and they'll all keep their jobs? Well, you may lose one. Oh, this is my wife, Errol. Uh, Lorna, Errol. Caroline, Lorna. Do you think it's too late to ring some of them? No, it's only 8:45. Wonderful, they'd probably like to hear. I'll get some tea. No, this calls for sherry. Better still, port. We've got some port. There may be a chance for you yet, Errol Wallace. Don't get your hopes up too high. It's only one night in a lifetime, isn't it? Fairy cakes with your port? It's a pity about everyone at the factory. Yeah. There's too many people there, anyway. How do you mean? Well, it was really crowded and it was smelly. Do you want an ice cream? Yeah, if you want one. So you feel the market for moccasins is almost beat? Yes. I'd say so, yes. Even the Indian look with the fringe? Well, I was thinking of lessening the emphasis on moccasins altogether. Oh. Yes. You already have the equipment and the skills to move into new areas like, uh, gloves and jackets and... What about seat covers? Yes. Yes! You're right! Here I am touching 75 and forging ahead into a new future. We can count on your assistance with all this? As much as I can, Mr. Ball. You see, I think your greatest asset is your people. I've always said that. Good. So why not get them all involved as shareholders? Shareholders? Yes. Yes, or, um, partners. Partners? Yeah. Because I think you've been protecting them for far too long, Mr. Ball. I wonder if now isn't the time to be taking on more people? Expanding. Expanding? Aha! No, I don't think so. Not quite yet, anyway. I think I will have another port. Oh, me too. Expanding. Thank you. Um... Anyway, here's to you, Mr. Ball. And to you, Mr. Wallace. And our continuing success. Yes. Tiger, haven't we seen this one before? Yeah... Excuse me. I think you're sitting in my seat. - Sit down! - Sit down! Huh? And anyway, my dad's worked for your dad for 25 years. How can you say it's a good thing that he got the sack? It's not too crowded in there. Hey, hey, hey. Piss off. Shut up, idiot. I'm not talking to you. And Uncle Gordon's worked there even longer than him... ...the show is about to begin. For two hours, the courage and judgment of three men and a woman will be matched by the speed and stamina of their cars. We're ready for them and here they come. This is Pat Jones, the Kansas girl who likes to drive like a man. Who is it said "women can't drive"? Hi. Want to come for a walk? No, thanks. What is wrong with you, Carey? You are so stupid! Me and Cheryl have split up. Oh, you're immature, you're selfish and you're childish! Who are you talking to? - A friend! - Probably Carey again. You and Fletcher. You don't know anything about anything. Especially about girls. Oh, you're so juvenile and naive and horrible! And you know what I think? I don't think I like you anymore. Looks like a lot of things are gonna change around here. Yeah, it's good. I hear they're gonna make us partners. Sharing the profits. You're late, Carey. You'd better put yourself on report, son. Dad? Has Wendy come to work yet? Haven't seen her. Oh, sorry, Aunty Gwen. Edna? Has Wendy been up here? No. Have you seen her anywhere? Nope. Hey, Fletcher? Fletch! You seen Wendy? No. She's not around here. And I'm just off night shift. Everyone's back. Yeah. Bugger it. I'm finished work. I've got the afternoon off anyway. Me and Shirley are going out to the airport to watch the planes. I thought I might propose. Want to come? Are you going to get married? No, just engaged. Hey, Kim's leaving. Do you want to sign the card? Bugger off. Where's he going? Oh, he's got some new big job. Well, do you want to sign? No way. Hey, Win, have you seen Wendy? Oh, she's not in today. Are you sure? Yeah, she hasn't signed the card. How did you get here? Flew. No. How? What are you thinking about? You. Have you ever been up on the factory roof? You can see all of Spotswood over to the refineries, and right across Yarraville as far as Seddon. And there's a thousand pigeons up there and they never fly away from you because they don't think a human can be up so high. Do you want to see? This is great. It's just the opportunity I've been waiting for. Thanks very much, Mr. Wallace. This is where you belong.
