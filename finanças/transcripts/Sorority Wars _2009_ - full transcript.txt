[MUSIC - LINDSEY RAY, "PICTURE PERFECT"] (SINGING) You played your piano, wrote silly love songs and sang me fast asleep. You drove me to New York, healed my first heartache. And I remember how every night and every day you're never afraid to always say that I'm your moon and stars. You've got me singing, la da da da, la da da da, life is never picture perfect. La da da da, la da da da, but we are perfect just the way we are. You told me stories, took me to movies and held my hand so sweet. We dressed in our snowsuits, made pretty angels. And I remember lying on our backs, taking a rest, making a guess, trying our best to count the moon and stars. Oh, thank you. I don't know. How does my hair look? Ugh, perfect as always. Thank you. OK, ready? Yes. Let's go. Ladies, it's time. Shall we? (SINGING) La da da da, la da da da. We are perfect just the way we are. Being in a sorority is a privilege. But being a Delta, that's an honor. I don't need to tell you how deeply the actives rely on the insider opinions of us alumni when judging our local girls at rush. Now it's up to us to do our part to ensure that only the right girls get in to protect the legacy we all built. Lutie. You can endorse as many as you like this year. We all understand the pressure, so please keep the good of the house in mind. Strong crop this year. Which reminds me-- spoke to my Gwen. Reminded her that Katie is prime Delta material. She'll be in good hands. LUTIE: I still can't believe it's her time already. I still feel like a freshman pledge myself some days. Oh, honey, don't we wish? [LAUGHS] This is the next best thing-- both our girls following in our footsteps. I couldn't ask for anything more. (SINGING) Just the way we are. [MUSIC - DANIELLE MCKEE, "THIS IS ME"] (SINGING) This is my life. I'm on my own. Don't need anyone to guide me down the road. I'm finding out who-- Hi. (SINGING) Yeah, who I want to be. This is me. This is my life. I'm in control. Moving so fast to where I wanna go. Name, please, so we have your information. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. Hey. So I guess those are the preppy girls, and those are the slacker guys. God, it's like some kind of gang war, only really, really perky. Oh my goodness, how are you girls going to keep them straight? There's so many. A house for every girl. That was our mission when I started here. Oh, this is so exciting. Aw. Katie Parker! Look at you, all grown up. I can't believe you're here. You two must be proud. My Gwen tells me your Katie is quite the hot rush ticket. Oh. What? Every year, there's a handful of premium girls that all the good houses fight over. Poaching a legacy is total sport around here. Be warned. But we already have dibs on you. In your pledge, I totally want to be your big sis, OK? Pinky swear. OK. Gwen's been elected Delta rush chair. It's quite an honor. Mm-hmm. And if she does a good job, she's a lock for president next year, just like her mom. All right, I'm headed back to the house with the other alumni. See you later? Yes, definitely. Come on. Gwen! OK, bye. KATIE: Come on, let's go. You guys go ahead. I'll catch up. Mom? You OK? Oh, just being silly. Reliving some ancient memories. Some of the best moments of my life happened on this stage. This is where Delta won its first ever Tri Crown. I was lead vocals. I bet you rocked the house, huh? I held my own. Ooh, go, mom. Oh, it's your turn in the spotlight now. Three months, I'll be watching you up here. Oh, mom. Chill. I'm not even in Delta yet. You will be. You are beautiful and talented, all grown up. Mom, you promised you wouldn't cry. I can't help it. Well, you owe me 5 bucks. I am so proud of you and so excited we're going to have all this to share. Yeah, me, too. Hey, I have a crazy thought. How would you like to visit Delta and meet all the girls? Can we? I don't think I'm supposed to be fraternizing during rush. I think I can pull some strings. Come on, let's go get Sara. It'll be fun. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Katie! Hey! Oh my gosh, do you believe this place? What do you think? I think this is the actual floor plan of the Barbie dream house. Oh, I know. Can you imagine living here for the next four years? That's not all. Full-time cook, weekly maid, and sleeps more girls than any other chapter. Best house ever. I'm telling you, if they have half as much fun as we had when we were here, this is going to be quite a year. Whoa. What's with the Super Bowl? Is this what I think it is? I've only seen it in pictures. LUTIE: Mm-hmm. That is the Tri Crown trophy. Tri Crown is legendary. It's this amazing competition between all the sororities every year. More like a war. And not to brag, but we totally dominate. And our mother started the whole thing. Well, that's a bit of a fib. It was actually a fraternity competition until the school went coed, and then us ladies just sort of took it over somehow. I like Gwen's version better. I still can't believe you talked me into all of this. What, the most fun you can have at college? Right, I'm sorry I twisted your arm. You should be. Now I have to face the fact that I am a secret conformist at heart. That vexes me. Well, if it suits your anarchist ego, Greek life isn't just about keggers and formals, OK? Are you drinking the Kool-Aid? Seriously. It is a proven fact joining increases your odds of staying in school and earning more after you graduate. - Wow. Will it also make my hair shiny and manageable? Fine. We just better get in the same house. I'm not doing this without you. Hey, we're only here for Delta. We're only doing full rush because we have to. I kind of like these Kappa girls. We're about friendship, not gossip. Fun, not drama. That sounds great. Still not Delta. I don't know. Speaking of Delta, is it me, or was Gwen totally about to dry hump you in the quad this morning? [LAUGHS] I don't know. What was that about? She barely even talked to us in high school. I guess you weren't such a hot ticket when you had a retainer. Or was it headgear? No, she was just being nice in front of our moms because we're BFFs. Probably ignore us again the rest of rush. [MUSIC - GIRLS LOVE SHOES, "SUPAMEDICINE"] (SINGING) I'm in a pickle 'cause I'm fickle. Don't know what to do. Every girl has the right to need a change of view. I'm so impatient it takes-- [KNOCKING] (SINGING) --imagination to get through. Gwen! Hi. So, big news. There's a party at our brother fraternity tonight. Very VIP. You in? Absolutely. Wait, you meant-- you meant both of us, right? Of course. Any friend of Katie's is a friend of Delta's. Be ready at 9:00. OK. Let's go, girls. Lucky bitches. [GIGGLING] [MUSIC - ST. JOHN, "KEEP IT COMIN'"] (SINGING) We like to party like we party all night long, yeah. Come on, come on. Pump, pump it up. Keep it comin'. All right. Keep it comin'. All right. The other sororities will try to tempt you this week. But they can suck it! You're ours. Hey, I thought taking rushes to parties was against the rules. Screw rules. You're worth it. It's like, we're continuing our mom's legacies. You and I, we are totally going to own this house. So whose party is this? The Betas. Definitely the hottest guys on the campus. Come on. And we're like this with them. Join Delta, and you will be, too. Hi. Thanks. Here. Oh, you like? Don't be shy. What a Delta wants, a Delta gets. Come here. Beau Beau. Gwenny Gwen. Meet Katie. She's our top pick. Definite Delta material. So you be nice to her and tell her how we're the hottest house on the block, OK? Have fun. I gotta mingle. - Bye. Wow. Friend of Gwen's, huh? Mm, bet I can guess your major. Go for it. English. No, no, no, no, history. Why would she want to waste her time majoring, Deac? I bet Katie's just here for her MRS, right? Actually, I'm an econ major. But apparently, you're majoring in sexist ass. [CHOKING] Well, good luck with that. Oh, we like her. Ow. Ooh. Ow. You should put some ice on that. OK, that-- that's a little funny. Seriously, though, I'm-- I'm really sorry. I'm PJ, by the way. Katie. Katie, are you rushing, too? Yeah, that's the plan. Well, tell you what, uh-- Hey, man. Thanks, bro. If we both make it out of rush alive, I'll buy you some real beers to celebrate, in bottles and everything. OK, you've got a deal. OK. PJers, [INAUDIBLE] now! OK, I'll, uh-- I'll see you around, OK? I'm serious about those beers. Unbelievable! We're here 10 minutes. I have a migraine. You have a date. Well played. Here. Who wants your pity beer? OK. I'm kidding! I totally want your pity beer! [GIGGLING] Woo! Woo! I'mma dance! [CAR REVVING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome to rush, ladies. Get ready for the five hardest days of your lives. Oh, this is amazing. Let's move it, girls! Let's go. Now for those of you who don't know, here's how rush works. Each day you'll visit a different sorority house and start narrowing them down. Now every sorority has a chance to sell themselves to you through theme days, using pledge songs, slideshows, and skits. (SINGING) Gamma rho your boat ashore. You're so cool. Gamma rho we adore. We're no fools. Gamma rho your boat ashore. You're so cool. Gamma rho we adore. [SNICKERING] Not every house will fit you. But some houses you'll like right away. So the brave rush crept slowly down the old, haunted door stairway. And into the empty, dark foyer, desperate to know if Kappa bid her. She felt her way to the mailboxes. Took out her keys, reached her hand deep inside for her bid card, and-- [AIR HORN] [LAUGHTER] Just a little reminder, ladies. BOTH: Life would be scary without Kappa. [CLAPPING] Oh my god, they are insane. I love it. We like to think rushing is like falling in love. Both sides have to feel it. And you'll know it when it happens. Our alumni are the most dedicated and connected. It's instant networking potential. Research shows that Delta girls go on to higher paying jobs. Unofficial research says we also date cuter guys. In closing, we also have the highest ratio of legacy retention. We even have a Delta legacy in our midst. Stand up, Katie Parker. [APPLAUSE] Thank you, ladies, for coming. Thank you. Do not forget this is all a test. We are so excited. While you are judging them, they will be judging you. No matter how much they seem to like you-- Hey, you. SARA: Hey. Come here. --don't take anything for granted. Every night, each of you rushees will choose your favorite houses. Meanwhile, the sororities will be cutting you. Oh. She's cute. I like it. [LAUGHS] No, never going to make it. Totally Delta. We get her or die, ladies. [MUSIC PLAYING] I got invited. Awesome! Oh my god, I knew Delta liked me! Holy crap, I actually made [INAUDIBLE].. Delta asked me back. Yeah, why wouldn't they? Wait, whoa, why do you have one for Kappa, too? I thought we were only rushing Delta all the way. You know, I just don't want to look cocky. Oh. Well, I wouldn't worry. You're their dream girl, remember? I'm the one who still has to pray I get in. I can't believe you're so stressed about this. You know whatever happens, I have your back, OK? What can I say? In the gym class of life, I am the fat kid on the sideline. But you wouldn't understand, Miss I Have Two Pref Parties Tonight. [MUSIC - BEAUTIFUL SMALL MACHINES, "SUPER CONDUCTER"] KAPPA GIRL 1: Woo! Woo! Go, Kappa! KAPPA GIRL 2: Ready? Kappa rules! KAPPA GIRL 3: Woo! (SINGING) Hey! Hey! I've got the frequency to turn you on. I've got the frequency to turn you on. Superconductor, keep it going. I've got the frequency to turn you on. Hey there, tin smiles, I've been loading down your files, moving up your dials and I think I know what's going on. I am programmed clickety-click at your command. Shift for a man with the heart of an automaton. Did we scare you away already? I understand. [INAUDIBLE] this can be intimidating. Sorry, I gotta get going. I was supposed to be at Delta a while ago. Gotcha. Look, I had a really great time tonight. But I don't want to mislead you. I'm sort of supposed to go Delta. Oh, the legacy thing, huh? Can I ask, why did you pref me? Well, I'm not going to lie. Stealing a Delta legacy would be a coup. But mostly, you know your people when you meet them. And trust me. You're Kappa people. Thanks. Just one piece of advice. Whichever house you pick, make sure you like what they stand for. Because you're about to stand for it, too. See you. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Woo! Get your cute butt in here, girl! We missed you! Let's all make Katie welcome, you hot Delta bitches! Katie! Katie! Oh my god, I'm so glad you're here. Oh, jello shots! I was this close to calling standards on those Kappa skanks for keeping her too long. I know. It's like, hi, have some tact, people. Tell me. [GIGGLING] (SINGING DRUNKENLY) Beauty in her heart and soul, my sister till I'm gray and old. There's no greater treasure in all the world than a Delta Theta Theta girl. You were right. The Deltas are the best! Woo! What's that all about? That's Lana. We were having boat races before you got here. And she puked on Gwen's shoes. And it was awesome! I am so glad you talked me into this. You are the best friend ever. Mm, creepy. Oh my god. [LAUGHTER] So what did you tell her? Who, Lana? I said that we would forgive and forget. But we expect you to show loyalty and only put Delta's name on her bid. Wait, we're going to bid her? Of course not, stupid. But this way, no one else can either. And she'll be left with no house. Serves her right. Hey, what about that Sara chick you keep letting hang around? GWEN: That one's not my fault. Katie won't cut the cord, but Sara's a brain. She can earn her place. I mean, someone has got to raise the GPA while we have fun. But I want to stay. You're leaving? Um, yeah, it's kind of late. Am I crazy here? Because I'm picking up some attitude. I mean, first, I have to practically drag you away from those Kappa bitches with my teeth. And now you can't wait to leave? I gotta say, you're not really feeling the Delta love. Look, it's nothing personal. And I'm just tired. Where are my shoes? I forgot my shoes. Don't panic. I'm all over it. Are you rejecting me? What? No-- Do you know how bad this will make me look if we lose a legacy? How pissed my mom will be? Your mom? You humiliate Delta like this, trust me, you will be sorry. Look, go take your Xanax, Gwen. This isn't a big deal, OK? No, you're right. You're right. Cold feet are no big deal. And that's all this is. You and I are practically sisters. And sisters support one another. Do the right thing here, Katie. Have some principles. Me? Wow, you're really one to talk. What's that supposed to mean? Well, it means you've broken every rush rule that there is. I mean private parties, bribing these girls with drinks. Oh, and what about promising that poor Lana girl a bid just so she'd be cross cut? What the hell was that? Boohoo. So I break a few stupid rules to get the best girls. That's what makes me a winner. And as for the dirty rushing, I'd like to see you try to prove it. So would I. Standards meeting tomorrow at 10:00. We'll get to the bottom of this. Oh my gosh. Now look what you've done. Found them! Hey, what's her problem? Promising bids? Cross cutting? Drinking games? This makes all of us look bad. But we still have to prove it, and Lana won't go on record. Besides, it's her word against the Deltas. She's not the only chance we've got. We'd like to hear from rushee Parker. Wow, so this is, like, Sorority Supreme Court, huh? OK, wrong crowd. Just to clarify, you personally overheard plans to promise a rush a bid with the intent of cutting her? Look, I don't want to cause any drama, honestly. Can we just forget all this? No. Accusations were made. Either you were lying, or you weren't. I wasn't lying. Thank you. Take your seat. I was starting to get worried. We really need to talk. Sara Snow, please stand. Do you confirm these accusations? No. Are you denying rushee Parker's version of events? Do you deny there was alcohol? I just didn't share her experience. I mean, the Deltas have been proper and conscientious around me the entire time. (WHISPERING) Sara, what the hell? We've heard enough testimony. Some conflicting, but I have to trust what I witnessed last night. Deltas, please stand. You know the rules. You know the consequence of breaking them. Your annual house formal is hereby canceled. You can't do that! What? Mom? It's not my fault. Do not get angry at me. OK, Gwen, slow down. What-- what are we talking about here? Standards. Katie said we were dirty rushing, and they believed her. They canceled our formal! What? Oh. Oh, hell no. Hang on. Hello? Lutie, what did your daughter just do? Snitch. Come on, guys. Let's go. Ugh, hater. Nice. Very mature. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? GWEN (ON PHONE): You just made a big mistake. This isn't over, bitch. We're going to make your life hell. [KNOCKING] Mom. What are you doing here? Get dressed, dear. We need to talk. How is Sara? KATIE: I don't know. She's been avoiding me since yesterday. I can't believe you came all the way to campus over this. I had no choice. So we're going to have a meeting with the Dean in an hour. Are you serious? This is serious, Katie. Now I'm not impressed with how you've handled yourself. Well, I'm sorry. God. Oh, and I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking. Don't be smart. Your well-being is what I'm concerned with. Darling, you've tainted yourself. The right sorority can provide you social and business contacts for life. Being a Delta practically guarantees you job interviews when you graduate. What house is going to take you now? It doesn't matter. I'm not rushing anymore. I'm dropping out. What? Look, I know this isn't what we had planned. But it doesn't have to be a big deal. Katie. Mom, I'll be fine, really. OK, school starts in three days This will all blow over. Look, I gotta go. Well-- GIRL 1: Delta? GIRL 2: Yes! Ah! GIRL 1: Ah, I'm so excited! GIRL 2: Me, too! GIRL 1: Woo! Yes! Sara. Not so fast, Judas. What the hell happened yesterday? You're the one who put me in that position in the first place. What was I supposed to do? Oh, I don't know-- support me, tell the truth? And get blackballed by the one sorority I was bidding? Look, why do you care about a stupid sorority? So first, you tell me Greek life is awesome. Now sororities are stupid. Gee, am I allowed to have thoughts of my own on this? Yes, of course you are. Just, I thought you'd share mine. It doesn't matter anyway. We obviously can't join them now. Am I stroking out here, or did you just give me an order? Oh, don't be so dramatic. I just-- You told me I couldn't do something because you weren't doing it? Yeah, that's an order. And it's too late. Sara. I can't believe how selfish you're being about this. Me? The whole campus wanted you. You could have gone anywhere. Finally, I meet people who like me for me, and you're being such a baby about it. Let's just cool off. OK? And so we'll be in different sororities. So what? It doesn't mean we can't still be friends. When you had to stab me in the back to get there? I guess that's exactly what it means. Fine. I guess I should pack my stuff and move into Delta. Maybe you should. [MUSIC - SWEETERSONGS, "WHY NOT NOW"] (SINGING) La da da da da da da da. La da da da da da da. Give it up, break the hold. Take the edge of all that noise. [KNOCKING] What now? (SINGING) Turn it down. Feel the crying. Oh! Hi. I got into Beta. Whew. [LAUGHS] I've been celebrating. I can see that. Congratulations. Thanks. I guess only one of us made it through rush alive, huh? Hey, I still owe you that beer. Uh, we're having a keg and egg party tomorrow night. It should be insane. Katie Parker, will you be my date? Yeah, I'd love to. OK, I'll pick you up at 8:00. Wear your jammies. (SINGING) Just let go. There's no way I would drop you. La da da da da da da da. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ew. Hey, econ girl. Great. So look, other night, rumor has it I may have come off as a bit of a-- - Jerk? Nope. A neo misogynist? Actually, it was-- Troll? Hun? Reprobate? Wow. And she's as good with her adjectives as she is with numbers. That's awesome. Thank you. This was good. Glad we had this little talk. I feel better. Here comes herpes girl. Excuse me. No kidding. Ew, she's coming this way. Don't get too close. No kidding. Do you think it's real? Ew, I can't believe he's sitting down next to her. Let's go. OK. Awkward. I don't know. Let's try this again. I'm Beau, and I'm really not as bad as you think I am. Considering how low that bar is, I'll conceive the possibility. I just can't stand Gwen and her girls. I just made you guilty by association. And that was wrong of me. Thank you. Especially now, I'm not associating with anyone. What does that mean? Come on. I mean, after that stunt you pulled, you're like Typhoid Mary. Now there's probably never been a less popular girl on campus, thanks to Gwen and her [INAUDIBLE] mafia. Is this seat taken? Hey. I don't recommend the company. Wow, I have never seen you tank with a girl before, Beau. That was almost art. I know, right? I'm off my game with that one. I guess I should go apologize for being a jerk again. No, let me. I need to talk to her anyway. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Sorry, I just really needed some air. Well, it's no problem. So how are you doing? I haven't seen you since the Great Sorority Inquisition. I'm OK, I guess. Liar. I think I know what's bothering you. And I just want you to know that Kappa has got your back. It is the least we could do. Oh. Oh my god. I know, it's really crazy. What the hell are these? Where did you get them? They're all over campus since last night. So this is why everybody's been staring and laughing? Are you kidding? Oh my god. Katie. Look, Gwen's a freak, no doubt. Knowing her, she won't stop this anytime soon. So what do I do? Talk to Panhellenic. I've never really heard of a girl being allowed to join a house after quitting rush, but-- Wait, that's your solution? Joining a different sorority? Yeah. They're not all like Delta, Katie. Every house is different. Some are sluts, some are snobs. Some are the best girls you'll ever meet. It doesn't matter. It was a mistake for me to rush in the first place. It's not for me. Because of Gwen? No, because I have an IQ above dryer lint. And I don't need to buy my friends with sorority dues. Wow. Thanks. No, I-- No, look, you had one bad experience with one bad house. I get it. But judging every sorority because of that makes you as big a snob as Gwen is. I guess I had you wrong, Katie. Maybe you do belong with Delta. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, screw it. [MUSIC - THE EXPLODERS, "PRETTY GIRLS"] (SINGING) Nobody will love you. Nobody will love you. Nobody will love you. Nobody will. Nobody will, hey! Hey. There you are. Hey, what are you doing here? Um, you invited me? Yeah, but I thought when I didn't come by, you-- you know. Look, if you don't want me here, then have the decency to say it to my face. OK, look. Gwen and her Deltas date a lot of our senior brothers. And if you come to our parties, the Deltas [INAUDIBLE].. So it's kind of the house rule that we can't be seen with you. You're serious? Look, Katie, I think you're great. But I'm just a pledge. These guys can make my life a living hell. And it's not my fight. It's a lot of other things to think about it. It wouldn't happen in real life. Yeah, I like your PJs. Well, I like yours, too. Sara? They gave me a little Delta makeover. Do you like it? I can't even deal with this right now. Oh my god. What are you doing here? Trust me-- Snitch. ALL: Snitch. [GIGGLING] Snitch. Snitch. Snitch. Snitch. Snitch. Snitch. You are a piece of work, Gwen. [LIGHT CRYING] Mom? Look, I was wrong. I need your help. Can I come home? Uh, motion to send an arrangement to the senior actives congratulating them on a job well done. I mean, we have a really strong looking rush class this year. Mm-hmm, seconded. How are the other houses looking for this year's competition? What competition? Now let's not get glib. You know the moment we sit on our laurels, some sad little house will come from behind and steal that Tri-Crown. Any new business to table, hmm? Actually, I do have some business. Hmm? I had a chat with Katie, and it seems-- and believe me, I find this hard to believe myself. It seems she's been the target of some harassment. It needs to stop. What? That's appalling. You-- you're not saying you think it was one of our Delta girls, are you? Well, who else could it be? What? What? Hello? Don't you remember college at all? Yeah. Your daughter stepped on a hornet's nest when she opened her mouth. What are you talking about? Katie not only defamed Delta, she smeared the whole rush system. I'm sure girls from all over campus were offended, from pledges to wannabes. Yep. Any one of them could have taken matters into their own hands. I mean, because nobody likes a tattletale. It's-- it's really true. It's sad, and it's wrong. And really, our hearts go out to her. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But if fingers are going to be pointed anywhere, don't you think they should be at Katie for starting all this drama in the first place? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Let's talk fundraising, shall we? - Yay. - Woohoo! I think that's just sororities, honey. There's always some kind of drama going on. Dad, that's so sexist. Well, look at your mom and her friends. I don't know any grown man to give a damn about fraternity politics 20 years out of school. No, but you and your father still cry over college football. Yeah, but that's important. Fine. Maybe we're each just stupid in our own ways then. Agreed. Hey, honey. Hey. I'll just, uh, leave you guys. So, did you talk to them? I did. And they are very concerned about you. Concerned? What does that mean? They think it's terrible. And they wish they could help, but honey, it's all been anonymous. Are you sure it's Delta? You're seriously asking me that? Katie-- Don't worry about it. I thought you could help me, I was wrong. It's no big deal. Honey, it's not that simple. Things are complicated at the alumni level. It is very political. Mom, it is an alumni group, not the freaking UN. It's fine. I'll handle it myself. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] [KNOCKING] KAPPA GIRL: Somebody get the door! [KNOCKING] God, make it stop already! I want to be a Kappa. And I want to be Angelina Jolie. Brad Pitt years, not Billy Bob. What's your point? You said that I could petition to late rush. Is that true? It's a long shot. Anyway, why should we give you a second chance? Because you were right, OK? I screwed up, and I judged all sororities based on Delta. And I was wrong. Just listen. We're about friendship, not gossip. Fun, not drama. I mean, that's all I wanted in the first place. And if I can still be a part of a house like that, I'd really like to try. Well, we'd have to vote on it as a house. I understand. Hey! If we can get it by standards, you're in. If everyone could please calm down. Ladies, take your seats. Sisters, what say you? Given the circumstances, does Katie Parker have your permission to join Kappa as a late pledge? The nays? And the yeas? Yeas have it. So ordered. [APPLAUSE] Oh, I'm sorry. If you're looking for Sara, she had to hurry back and do all her homework. But I don't see why. Your calendar should be cleared since you have no formal at all. How's that working out for you? Well, it's good to see you in a good mood again. Leave some room. Your mom made custard. Oh, no, I can't stay long. I just came to grab a few dresses. I've got somewhere to be tomorrow night. Were you even going to tell me you joined a different sorority? Should I have? Don't be smart, young lady. Here we go. You know, I was beginning to understand why you did what you did. I even felt for you. Maybe I pushed you too hard. Maybe sororities weren't right for you. Mom-- Only then I heard from everybody but you that you like sororities just fine. You just decided to humiliate me and mine. How do you think I look to the other alumni? Why are you making this about you? Not me. Us. We were supposed to share this moment. Remember? Enjoy your initiation. Meanwhile, I have to help the Deltas affirm their pledge class without you. She can't stay angry forever, kid. Yeah, I'll watch her starting to feel that way. ALL: See here at Kappa Theta Psi, we pledge ourselves to thee. With our free hearts and minds, forever sisters we shall be. And all our Kappa lives, we will build your legacy. These pens symbolize your acceptance among us. We are all sisters now. Wear them with pride. Kappas forever. And some of you have special guests waiting to welcome you here tonight. Mom! Honey, you look beautiful. I'm so proud of you, baby. [HUMMING] ALL: (SINGING) Beauty in her heart and soul, my sister till I'm gray and old. There's no greater treasure in all the world than a Delta Beta Theta girl. [HUMMING] Such a shame. This could be so special for you with Katie here. [MUSIC - SAMANTHA JADE, "GET AWAY"] (SINGING) Seize the moment, attempted fates. Step up the cold, dark into you. So many boys who want to holler at me, better make your move. Tick tock, tick tock. (SINGING) You're on the clock. Say it, 'fess up. Come on, now what? What makes you think that you're so special? Flaunting like I'm not on your game. Don't mean to seem disrespectful. Hey, girl. Hey. You can really sing. Thanks. Bam, what do you think? I love it. Order, like, 20 of them. Put them all over campus. Shove it down Delta's throat. You got it. Hey, that reminds me. I need your date's name for the foam formal by Friday. Just a security formality. Oh, right. You do have a date? Yeah, what, are you kidding? Tons. Not really. None. You aren't shy, are you? No. But apparently, I'm contagious, remember? And I kind of worry about any guy that's willing to date herpes poster girl. Right, I never thought about that. I'll tell you what. Don't give it another thought. I'll handle it. Really? Absolutely. One Prince Charming coming up. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] Ugh. Whoops, I think you accidentally closed the door on my face. Hello, Beau. Hello, Ms. Parker. You look lovely this evening. Yes, well, unfortunately, I am developing a bit of a cough. [COUGHS] Wow, faking sick. That really gets you, huh? That's a good sign. What, your impending homicide? I was thinking more like unbearable sexual tension. I take it Heather didn't fill you in on this arrangement. Not so much. Look, you've got a party to go to. And I'm just guessing, but I'm probably the only guy who's come to your door tonight. [SIGHS] Fine. And thank you. But I don't have to like this. You ever been to a foam party before? No. No, what-- what exactly am I in for? [MUSIC - HAWK NELSON, "YOU HAVE WHAT I NEED"] [CHEERING] (SINGING) I've tried my best to hear out the masses. I've heard it all from A to Z. I've read it all, been to all of the classes. And still I'm trying, but I just can't see through the smoke and I don't want it, this confusion. I don't want a false solution. Give me something to hold onto. I want what you have 'cause you have what I need. You have what I need. Oh my gosh. Exactly. [PHONE VIBRATING] Come on, let's go. (SINGING) But all I got was empty fists. Can you hear me? I don't want it, this confusion. I don't want a false solution. Give me something to hold onto. I want what you have 'cause you have what I need. [MUSIC - GIRLS LOVE SHOES, "COME GET YOUR RIDE"] (SINGING) Come get your ride. Come get your ride. Come see how fun it could be to be alive. Come inside and baby, get your ride. Get it started! You give it. The feeling don't start keep on 'cause you really got me reeling. You know, I am starting to believe my mom. These might just be the best years of my life. Totally. I gotta say, this kicks the ass of any formal I've ever been to. Well, everyone knows that Kappa girls are just more damn fun. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, yeah! Woo hoo! Want to go for a swim? Not exactly what I had in mind. Careful. This goes deep before you swim in it. I'll avoid the deep end, I promise. You know, you're-- you're hard to get a read on. At that first party, you were an ass, and here, you're-- Charming, roguish, debonair? You're less ass-y. I'll take less ass-y. I just realized something. We were at a Beta party when we met. You're a Beta. Yep, me Beta, you Kappa. Your point? I thought your fraternity made up some rule that you couldn't be seen with me. Or what, the fraternity police is going to bust me? Are you serious? I know Gwen's putting you through hell, but I don't need anyone's permission to like you. OK? Yeah, did I overplay that? No No, it was hot. Let's go get some air. [RETCHING] Ah, that's gotta be a health code violation. Ooh. [GURGLING] Let's go, come on. You OK? Are you OK? What the hell's going on? There's gotta be something wrong with the food. What did you eat? What didn't I eat? Oh my god. What's up, ladies? Oh, hey, tonight's your big formal, isn't it? How's that working out for you? Toodles, bitches. Bye. Woo! OK, they want war? They got it. Katie, you in? Yeah, try and stop me. We've put up with Delta long enough. It's time to take Gwen down. Yeah. And there's only one way to do it. We've got to steal the Tri-Crown. Yeah. Um, isn't that illegal? She doesn't mean literally, Seana. God. Katie, you know Gwen better than we do. What do you think? I think I love it. Gwen needs this. Winning Tri-Crown, it's her only shot at becoming president. Hello, random voice of reason here. Steal it how? It's not like we've been letting them win it on purpose. No, but we never wanted it as badly as they did. We just wanted to have fun. Right, well, now it's more than that. This is more than just winning the Tri-Crown. It's about taking it from Delta. OK, if we're going to do this, then we've got to nail them in the three legs of the crown-- intramural, trivia, and talent show. Katie would kill at the talent portion. We've all heard her sing. Definitely. Um, OK, sure. And I can cover volleyball. We could totally do this, girls. Everybody in favor? ALL: Yes! All right. Come on! [MUSIC - SAMANTHA JADE, "GET AWAY"] [GIGGLING] ALL: Go, Kappa! Nice! Oh! - I got it, oh! - Bump it! Ah! OK, here! (SINGING) Seize the moment, attempted fates. Step up the cold dark into you. So many boys who want to holler at me, better make your move. (SINGING) Tick tock, tick, tock. (SINGING) You're on the clock. (SINGING) Say it, 'fess up. Come on, now what? (SINGING) What makes you think that you're so special? (SINGING) Flaunting like I'm not on your game. (SINGING) Don't mean to seem disrespectful. But-- (SINGING) I don't wait. Woo! No. OK. All right. Good. Right, um, OK, but maybe all together? And maybe a little less jazz handsy. (SINGING) What makes you think that you're so special? Flaunting like I'm not on your game. Don't mean to seem disrespectful, but I don't wait. All right, ladies. That's it. Looking good. All right. Got it! Set it up! Yeah, just like that everytime, OK. You're on fire. All right. OK, now bump it. Nice! Delta! [BLOWS WHISTLE] [SCREAMING] Woo! [LAUGHTER] Woo! Woo! Woo-woo! ALL: Go Kappa! OK, I need some advice. Hmm. I'm-- I'm dreading going home this weekend. Who dreads Thanksgiving? Maybe turkeys. Well, Sara and her mom join us every year. And apparently, this one is no exception. Even though you guys are fighting? Well, her mom is like the sweetest woman in the world. Probably thinks all we need is some pumpkin pie and stuffing to magically be friends again. Have you even talked to Sara since the foam party? No. I'm so angry, I don't even know what I'd say. But it's going to be so awkward. Just eat enough turkey for a tryptophan coma and sleep through it. Look, you're going to have more fun than me anyways. I mean, I'm going to be stuck here on campus. You're not going home? No. I never do. It's too expensive, and, you know, plus, it's just me and my mom. Well, why don't you come home with me? It's perfect. You can diffuse the tension. And before you read too much into this, this is not-- this is not me taking you home to meet the parents or anything. I mean, yeah, they'll be there and you'll say hi and talk to them and stuff, but, uh. I'd really like that. Beau, I am so glad you came for Thanksgiving. Here we are! Oh, Lutie, you've outdone yourself. Thank you. Who wants a leg? Well, wait. We can't forget tradition, Will. Do you guys beat each other for Thanksgiving? It's a prayer stick. We all pass it around and say what we're thankful for. Sara and I made it at camp. And in light of recent events, I think the girls should go first. Katie. No, I'm-- I'm not really feeling it. [SCOFFS] OK, I changed my mind. Here's one. I am thankful that this food hasn't been messed with and that I'm not one of the cowards who sabotaged our formal. - Katie. No, that's not what I meant. Wow. OK, my turn. I'm thankful I've grown up since high school and know how to let things go. BEAU: I'm thankful-- Well, I'm thankful that-- --for this turkey, this lovely, juicy turkey. I'm thankful that I can still look at myself in the mirror. I'm thankful for all my new friends. Yeah, well, you know what? I'm thankful that I don't have my head stuck up-- Ooh, ooh, all right. There's a lot of thanks in this room. Thanks. Yes, well, let's eat. I like that Beau. He seemed sweet. Did you want to talk about Sara? Not really, but thanks. How's your Tri-Crown prep going? Are you girls ready for the competition next week? Mom, are you digging for inside information? Maybe a little. [CHUCKLES] What are you working on? We've decided to put an alumni photo on the backflap of our charity cookbook this year. So I'm just sifting through some old ones. You've been really working your butt off on this. Yeah. I just hope the alumni appreciate it. Can I see? Oh, please, yes. KATIE: You know, it's really great that you made so many true friends. I can only hope to be as close to my sorority sisters in 20 years as you are to yours. I think I have more photos in the garage. I'll be back. [APPLAUSE] 1, 2, 3. ALL: Delta! Ready to be humiliated? Can you teach me? I've had a little more practice. [WHISTLE] [CHEERING] It's right, girls! We should go for lunch after this. I feel like I haven't seen you in ages. What are you talking about? We see each other at meetings practically every week. Outside of that. I worry that this Katie and Gwen issue is impacting our friendship. Isn't it? All right, girls! Kill those Kappas! Woo! [WHISTLE] Come on, girls! Gwen! Come on, Delta, kick it up! Woo! [CROWD JEERING] [WHISTLE] What? Wow. Play a little rougher than in our years, don't you think? Well, that's what makes you winners. [CHEERING] All right! Good one, Katie! Ref! Sara, sub in for Cass. Cassidy, come on. Go on, get in there. Uh, come on, that's just low. KATIE: You've got to be kidding me. This is all I need. Get in the game, Katie! Woo! Yeah! What's the matter? You can't look me in the eye? Please, why don't you just get over yourself? I tried warning you. I had nothing to do with ruining your party. KATIE: You could have told me sooner. SARA: Hey, my conscience is clear. I'll bet. What, you were too busy doing everyone's homework that night? Deltas help each others study. Who cares? You just can't stand that I have new friends, can you? Down, now! Trust me, those aren't the kind of friends I want. Woo! Woohoo! Go Delta! Woo! Go Delta. Go Delta. Go Delta. Go Delta. Go Delta. Sara. Sara, they aren't your friends. OK, they only picked you because of me. You're lying because you're jealous. It's pathetic. No, I heard Gwen say it that night in the bathroom. And that's why I quit to protect you, you ungrateful spaz. You're right. You are a great friend, as long as I stayed in your shadow. Sara, look, I've known you since kindergarten. OK, you-- you're the funniest person I've ever met. You're freakishly smart. You can't dance for crap. And you quote Monty Python like it's your job. You know, do they know this? Have they even tried to get to know you at all? Sara, you are a lot of things, but you're not a follower. At least, you never used to be. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) You're going to cry in to the-- BEAU: What is this? KATIE: These are my mom's Tri-Crown competition tapes. You know, when you called me here for an evening of stolen goods, I was expecting something more exciting. Sorry to disappoint. So what exactly are we looking for? Inspiration. We completely blew the volleyball game, so now we have to win the other two events to win Tri-Crown. Heather's leaving the musical show up to me, and I'm totally blocking. BEAU: And what's the theme this year? Looking back moving forward. Oh, catchy. I know, right? [CULTURAL MUSIC] Look, it's the new Kappas on the block. [CHUCKLING] [BAND MUSIC] And that's a whole lot of Lycra all in one place. Whoa, wait, hang on. [MUSIC - "AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH"] I know her. That one on the right, isn't that your mom? LUTIE (ON TV): (SINGING) Ain't no mountain high. That's my mom. LUTIE (ON TV): (SINGING) Ain't no mountain low, ain't no river-- Oh, she was pretty. LUTIE (ON TV): (SINGING) --wide enough, baby. If you need me, call me no matter where you are, no matter how far. Don't worry, baby. Just call my name. Ah! Match. So anyway, Sissy's got a 3,000 square foot dance studio for the girls to practice in. Mary Ellen's got a line on a New York choreographer who's going to help them with their routine. We are set! Yay, wow. That's wonderful. Well, we might need the edge. Looks like Kappa is going to be a real contender this year, thanks to Katie's inside information maybe. What's that supposed to mean? Dana has a point. Maybe President-elect isn't the right position for you-- right now, until this all blows over. Why not? One could question where your loyalty lies. Are you saying-- what are you saying? Lutie, don't take it personally. It's just with all this distasteful drama with your daughter, it just doesn't look right. Look right to whom? We're the alumni. You're the only people who could possibly have a problem with it. Well, all right then. We have a problem with it. We had a vote, Lutie. Dana will be taking over as President-elect. Yeah. We, of course, still want you to stay part of our regular membership. Of course. For sure. Lutie. Lutie Parker, that is not Delta behavior! I'm not here to fight. I just want to give you this. What is it? Delta stole the questions to the quiz challenge. You deserve a fair fight against them. Them? Not us? Not anymore. I quit Delta. Now you quit? I only joined them because you told me I couldn't. And you said we weren't friends anymore, and I had nowhere else to go. Well, according to what you said at the game the other day, being my best friend was no great thrill anyway. It was great. It was just humbling. Come on, Katie, every party I got into, every double date only happened because of you. You're so much better with people. It was easier to follow your lead. Even if that is true, what does that have to do with Delta? It was a chance to see if there's more to me than your sidekick, to find out who Sara is without Katie. And now she's kind of a douche. Seriously, man! I mean lame. Blah blah, Delta. Blah blah, Gwen's so cool. Ugh. I miss the old me. I miss the old you, too, Sara. Let's be friends again. You know I miss you. But you also really screwed me over. Come on. I've had to live with Gwen for months. Isn't that punishment enough? Close. OK, just do one more thing for me. Give the judges an anonymous tip and tell them that the questions were compromised. Wow. That's pretty noble. Not really. I just want Gwen to know that we beat Delta because we're better, not just better cheaters. Done. Now if you'll excuse me, I have an ass load more studying to do. Sara, you were right. I did take you for granted. I was an idiot. Hey, so Sara and I finally buried the hatchet. You know, it's really weird imagery for forgiveness. Well, that's good. I knew you would. Old friends are the best friends. Now, why don't you go get yourself some snacks? Preferably healthy. Oh, yeah, I think that would have been perfect. Oh! Fancy running into you. We were just picking up some things for the Delta girls. Listen, Lutie, I hope there aren't any hard feelings still. Barely any feelings at all. I understand how you'd be frustrated. I'd be frustrated, too. Then, again, some of us know how to control our daughters. Or how to raise them in the first place. Yes, Summer, I know your daughter. How proud you must be. [THUNDER] All right, what's wrong now? I heard Summer's trash talk. Would it have killed you to defend us? Oh, so we're an us now, are we? I know you're angry, but I thought you'd at least defend me in public. With what magic wand am I supposed to protect you, Katie? Huh? Tell me. How am I supposed to cover for your mistakes? I'm not even on the alumni board anymore. What are you talking about? Mom. I've been asked to step down from President-elect. Wait, they fired you? They tried. I quit before they could. But that's ridiculous. But you helped start that chapter. Can they even do that? What do you think I've been trying to tell you? You think Gwen and her friends play mind games? These women have had 20 years to perfect it. Well, I mean, obviously, they're just punishing you for what I did. Is there something that I can do to-- Oh, I think you've done enough. Please don't tell your father. I think I've had enough humiliation for one day. [APPLAUSE] If everyone could settle down, we could get started. I hope you were right about returning those questions. All right, first question. Oh, this is from the psychology department. Freud qualified the unconscious into these three parts, the id, the ego, and-- [BUZZ] The Parthenon. [CLAPPING] [LAUGHTER] Incorrect. Uh, Kappa, you buzzed in next. Your answer? That would be super ego. Correct. Yeah! [APPLAUSE] I'm surprised you missed an ego question, Gwen. Game on. [POP ROCK MUSIC] [BUZZING] Micro and macro economics. Indeed. [APPLAUSE] [BUZZ] [CHEERING] [BUZZ] [CHEERING] [BUZZ] That would be the French Revolution. Absolutely right. [CHEERING] [BUZZ] [BUZZ] [BUZZ] [BUZZ] [BUZZ] [BUZZING] BOTH: [INAUDIBLE] Delta buzzed first, and they are correct. Yes! [APPLAUSE] Well, we have a tie so this last question will be for the win. Well, this is interesting. We are going to mix it up a little with some Tate University history. Ladies, which Greek house started the Tri-Crown competition? Delta's first. That would be Delta. I'm sorry, but that is not correct. Over to Kappa. According to my mother, it was started by the school's first five fraternities. Correct. Kappa wins. [APPLAUSE] There are no excuses. Listen to me, Gwen. That performance was unacceptable. Did you prepare for this at all? Crying is not going to get it done, young lady. I'm not crying. I'm tired. Well, I am tired of the excuses. You need to pick it up a whole bunch of damn notches, sweetheart, because when you look a fool, I look a fool. OK, fine. I get it. Are we winners or losers, Gwen? Hmm? Look at me. Are we winners or losers? We're winners. Good girl. Now give Mama a hug. Mm-mm. Wow. It's harsh. Mind your own business. Look, I'm just saying. I still can't stand you, but you didn't deserve that. Whatever, your mom is just as bad. Actually, she's not anything like your mom. You're right. Your mom didn't even care enough to come. We used to be able to talk about everything. I don't know when that stopped. Puberty? [CHUCKLING] I'm really sorry, mom. All my drama getting dumped on you, I didn't mean for that. Oh, sweetie. It's me who should apologize to you. You were just expecting me and Summer to behave like adults. The truth is, seeing you here, being back on campus, it reminds me of how I felt back then, how much potential I had, and 24 years later, how little I have to show for it, except for you and Delta house. Oh, come on. You don't really feel that way, do you? Oh, honey, I got married at 23. I have loved my life, but there's something they forget to tell domestic goddesses like myself. What? Well, that when you stay home, raise your children, keep your house, your family will love you. They will appreciate you. They just might not respect you. Is that how you think I look at you? I know what people think of sororities these days. I suppose I always hoped that one day, when you came to Delta, that you at least would understand, that you'd be proud of me, too. I do understand. Now. [CHUCKLES] So what can I do to make this up to you? Honestly, grind Delta into the ground. Steal the Tri-Crown. What? Trust me, the humility will be good for them. OK, I'll see what I can do. And for the record, I have never been anything but proud of you. [APPLAUSE] Thank you, Gammas. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here with their interpretation of this year's theme, Looking Back Moving Forward, Delta Beta Theta. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - JESSIE JAMES DECKER, "BLUE JEANS"] (SINGING) I step in my blue jeans, homewreck in my blue jeans. I got it from momma so I'm blessed in my. I sing in my blue jeans, bling in my blue jeans. When I hit the country club, I get in free with my. Oh, I'm like whoa. I got a fresh new pair. They're so dope. Oh, I'm like whoa. I got a fresh new pair. They're so dope. I got a brand new pair of blue jeans. Me and my posse looking fresh and so clean. What are they doing? That's like little whores on the prairie. [LAUGHTER] (SINGING) Giving my sugar one sweet performance. Hey, hey. Don't matter what you're wearing. Hey, hey. It's about the way you wear it. Hey, hey. Don't what you're wearing. Hey, hey. It's about the way you wear it. Y'all ready for this? Hey. Hey. When I bend and snap, when I step and clap, everybody else, who, who is that? When I'm out in public, everybody loves 'em. I know what they're wondering. When I bend and snap, when I step and clap, everybody asks, who, who is that? When I'm out in public, everybody loves 'em. I know what they're wondering. [CHEERING] MC: Let's hear it for the Deltas. Follow that. Bring it, blondie. Leave it on the stage, ladies. You're up, Kappa. [ZIPPING] [MUSIC - "AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH"] (SINGING) Ain't no mountain high, ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough, baby. If you need me, call me, no matter where you are, no matter how far. Don't worry, baby. Just call my name. I'll be there in a hurry. You don't have to worry. 'Cause, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough. Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you, babe. Remember the day I set you free. I told you, you could always count on me. And from that day on, I made a vow. I'll be there when you want me some way, somehow. 'Cause, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough. Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you, babe. (SINGING) Oh, no, darling. No wind, no rain. (SINGING) Or winters cold can stop me, baby. (SINGING) No, no, baby. (SINGING) 'Cause you are my goal. (SINGING) If you're ever in trouble, I'll be there on the double. Just send for me. (SINGING) Oh, baby. My love is alive way down in my heart, although we are miles apart. And if you ever need a helping hand, I'll be there on the double, just as fast as I can. 'Cause, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough, ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you, babe. Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough. Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you, babe. To keep me from getting to you! [CHEERING] On behalf of the judges, it is my honor to present the Tri-Crown trophy to Kappa Theta Psi. [APPLAUSE] Gwendolyn, sweetheart. Sweetheart, don't you worry. We can fix this. They cannot use a Delta in their song. I am sure of it. There's got to be some-- Mom, let it go. Someone once told me. Don't get me wrong. I still can't stand you. But you deserved what you got. [MUSIC - MARJORIE MAYE, "THIS IS MY STORY"] (SINGING) No time for cynical when life's so beautiful. Glass of empty seems so full when you look at it that way. The world can try and bring me down, but I want to fly. This is my story. This is my life. I don't know the ending but it's mine to write. This is my story. This is my chance. I'm not going to sit it out. I'm going to dance. I'm going to dance. There's my girl. Hey. I was just looking for you guys. You were amazing. Thank you. Hey, sir. Good to see you again. Did you like it? Oh, honey. I loved it. Aw. KAPPA GIRL 1: Katie! KAPPA GIRL 2: There she is! KAPPA GIRLS: Katie! Can you believe we got the Tri-Crown? Just one second, ladies. One for the record. Say "Greek." Greek! (SINGING) This is my story. This is my life. Don't know the ending, but it's mine to write. [MUSIC PLAYING]
