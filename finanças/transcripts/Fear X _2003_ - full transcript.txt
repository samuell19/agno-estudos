Who's harry caine my sister just called, she said some guy named harry caine is looking for me. He's got a picture of me and quinn. WELL, DO YOU KNOW HIM no. I thought maybe you might. How would I know him MAYBE YOU KNOW HIS WIFE. Oh, my god. KATE, HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK IT what am I supposed to think what, some complete stranger is just wandering around with a... Family photo ever since you got back... Something's going on. I promise you, kate, nothing's going on. I LOVE YOU. I'm not afraid of the truth. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Who was that WHO WAS ON THE PHONE I have to go back to the station for a couple of hours. I thought you wanted to stay home tonight. Hey, buddy. You wanna go visit aunt gayle it's tuesday. She'll be home by now. What about dinner I'll only be a couple of hours. Quinn, honey, if you're done why don't you go wash up, okay what's going on I can't help it, kate. Something has come up. Something's what why do you suddenly want us out of the house there's something I have to deal with. That you have to deal with have you done something you know there are things about work that I'm just not allowed to share with you. I do know a harry caine. Then why didn't you say something before should I be worried I mean, who is he I think he's part of an unfinished case. Why is he looking for me I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS. Are we in danger I would sooner die than to ever let anything happen to you. Hi. HI. Are you alone excuse me WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COMPANY I'm married. So, is your wife here No. Can I use your phone Hi. It's me. Yeah. SURE. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT ALONE I'm sorry. Hello, peter. Is there something wrong these kinds of meetings are dangerous. I know, but this is important. THERE'S A MAN BY THE NAME OF HARRY CAINE HERE. What's the problem he's asking about kate. YOUR WIFE DOES SHE KNOW HIM NO. But I think he's from wisconsin. HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONTACT WITH HIM I wanted to talk about it with you first. Do you think he's looking for you or is he looking for us no, that doesn't make any sense. You see, if he knew of us why would he just come here and openly make inquiries like this It was a woman. HER NAME WAS CAINE. Why did she have to be there right at that time it was just a shadow. I didn't know. You can't blame yourself, peter. You only saw the threat to your life. You knew. We all knew and accepted the possibility of this event happening, RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE HURT AND KILLED EVERY DAY. THAT'S THE WAY THE WORLD IS. Yes. Yes, we've talked about that. But all that talk never prepared me for the reality. I killed an innocent woman. We have to keep our focus on our goals, our ideals. Corrupt law enforcement is a cancer. It eats at the heart and moral fabric of society. Without law there is no order. What you did was right, peter. He was a corrupt cop and he's gone. BUT THERE ARE OTHERS. WE MUST KEEP OUR FOCUS. So, where does that leave us HE MAY BE ALONE, or they may be others. FIND OUT WHAT HE KNOWS. Peter... I know how difficult this is for you. BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE. I know. I'll do whatever's necessary. Would you prefer one of us taking care of this matter no. Thank you... But I created this situation. Lounge. Hold on. Are you a mr. Caine yes. THERE'S A PHONE CALL FOR YOU. Thank you. Hello MR. CAINE yes MY NAME'S PETER. Do I know you NO, WE'VE NEVER MET. I'M A FRIEND OF THE WOMAN YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. Oh. SHE'S ASKED ME TO COME AND MEET WITH YOU. OF COURSE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEET ME IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. BUT SHE IS HOME AND IF YOU WANNA SEE HER... Yes, I'd like to meet her tonight. GOOD. I'M IN ROOM 503, WHY DON'T WE MEET UP HERE why WELL, A STRANGER COMES TO TOWN LOOKING FOR MY FRIEND AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO HE IS. I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HER CONCERN. I'm not looking to hurt anyone. I just wanna talk to her. GOOD. I'M IN 503. Pleasure to meet you, mr. Caine. Please, come in. SIT DOWN. MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE. May I see the photograph, please I thought you were gonna take me to see your friend. SHE'S EXPECTING US, BUT... THERE ARE A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO CLEAR UP. Who gave you this photograph no one. I found it. IN KENWOOD PLAINS HOW DID YOU KNOW I... Who else has seen this picture no one. Where's your friend why are you so anxious to see her I need to talk to her. WHY I believe she can help me find someone I'm looking for. Who is that someone who can explain why my wife was murdered. What makes you think that I'VE GOTTEN THE INFORMATION. Then you've had help from others no, not really. I need to know why my wife was killed. Is that all you need And you really don't wanna kill this man I'm not a murderer. HOW DO YOU KNOW Is it worth your life I'm not living anyway. Then let's go see my friend. We'll take my car. Did you know my wife No. You. Why Why For god's sake... Why Oh... I'm sorry! No! Why did you go after him He murdered my wife. I see. He murdered your wife, so you went after him and killed him. I never wanted to hurt him. WHO IS "HE," MR. CAINE the name of the man you killed what's his name I don't know. Can I speak to you a minute, ed We did an extensive search of the hotel. AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY CRIME. NO CRIME. THERE WAS NO BODY, MR. CAINE. Not even the surveillance tapes show anything. We know what happened to you. YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHAT WAS. WHAT USED TO BE. ♪♪
