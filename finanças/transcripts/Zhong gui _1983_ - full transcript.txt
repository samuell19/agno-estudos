No We found something at the spot Come with us and see if it belongs to your wife Alright C'mon, hurry You bitches, how dare you seduce my boyfriend They're all here, take a look I've checked with the taxi station, but they said they never asked him to go to the Yi Dong Mansion There's something fishy here You've seen them all? Do they belong to your wife? Where did she work before? She works as a dealer at a casino Any enemies? No Did she get home from work punctually? Any lovers? I don't know You're lying You knew that your wife had a boyfriend and cuckolded you So you murdered her No Stop pretending We've already checked the records at the taxi station Your wife asked you over at the Clearwater Bay booth instead of Yi Dong Mansion I swear the taxi station asked me to go there You're not in court, there's no need to swear You picked her up at Clearwater Bay, brought her to the Yi Dong Mansion and killed her there Sir, why would I kill her? If I were the murderer I wouldn't have come to report to the police It's all very evident from the crime scene that my wife was raped and killed Had every case been that simple, half of the cops would have changed their profession My wife was murdered; Instead of going after the murderer, you're putting pressure on me Sir... Mr. Zhou, calm down Before the case is solved we have every reason to suspect anyone Have you seen this person before? Who are you looking for? Are you Mr. Fang Ming? Yes We are the police We'd like to invite you to the police station regarding that case at Yi Dong Mansion Don't wake my wife, I'm coming with you What are you looking at? Haven't you seen a man before? Bastard, you... What are you doing? Go... Sit Come in What's your name? Anthony Fang Chinese name? Fang Ming Did you know Irene who worked as a dealer in a casino? Yes Did you see her on August 18? Yes, that night I went with her for a ride and we had a bit of squabble After that she got off at Clearwater Bay According to the autopsy report your wife had semen in her body Therefore I suspect that person to be the murderer I admit my sexual relationship but I didn't kill her Do you remember whether you saw anyone that night or what happened? I saw a red car near the crime scene Don't move, get off the car... You must be tired of living Be gentle We are the police Is this your car? Whose car is it? What are you doing? About that case in Yi Dong Mansion we want you to help with the investigation I need to call home You may call from the police station Have a seat please Have some tea Thank you Previous generation detectives have a bad image sort of They sometimes framed people; but it's entirely different now I like telling stories and reasoning I'm going to tell you a story Qn the night of August 18 a murder case happened at the Yi Dong Mansion A young woman was the victim Soon after this her husband drove his taxi to the crime scene and saw a red Fiat sports car license plate no. CR 4417 What do you think of this story? I don't know I hope you two could help me complete the story about how the woman was killed Speak I'll wait for my lawyer It has nothing to do with me, I didn't do anything Says who, you should have had her then this wouldn't have happened Beer You caused all this trouble I have to share the blame with you If it weren't for my mom you'd still be inside I am good enough We are in such bad luck Had we left earlier that night we wouldn't have run into her husband Not a single person was in sight How come her husband went there? If he recognises us, we're finished Kill him, we have no choice How can we find him? I can find anyone I want to You shouldn't use force towards them I can sue you for harming people It was self defense, they wanted to kill me You beat us so badly and you still say that we wanted to kill you Tough guy, huh? Mr. Zhou, don't be mad Trust us we'll handle your wife's case If you are to do everything by yourself what's the point of us being the police? If you run into witchcraft your family will perish you have to believe this Come in My wife is dead I want you to help me seek revenge Although you saved me, I can't help you Your situation is... What? It's in your destiny, no one can help you Think of some other way yourself You seduce my wife and yet asked someone to beat me up I must have revenge Don't run I must avenge her I've been beaten to a cripple It's in your destiny If you keep thinking about revenge you might end up killing yourself too They destroyed my family and crippled me You still refuse to help me? You don't know black magic If you want to seek revenge using black magic you might kill yourself if it failed You... If you refuse to help me I'll report to the police that you stole dead people's bones Alright, I'll help you but don't regret it I won't I'm now exercising some advanced black magic to lead your wife's spirit to her murderers This method is assumed lost and is called seeding a ghost Don't be scared I am using your body to lead your wife's spirit back Now bring me to your wife's body immediately "Grave of beloved wife Irene Zhu" Give me that packet Done Where's my wife's body? It's here, follow me Sit down Close your eyes and don't look Rub some coconut oil for your wife Her spirit will feel better Qh, what happened to my hand? This is the price of using black magic It will get more serious in the next couple of days You said you won't regret it, rub it From now on, all those who have harmed your wife will have no peace I don't know what you want to do You're not studying nor working Spending all your time in bad company None of your business None of my business?
