[engines rumbling over tense, menacing synthesizer music] [plane engine rumbling] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [plane whooshing] [tense synthesizer music] [engine rumbles to a stop] [tense synthesizer music] - What happened, Klausmann? I got a message in Miami to catch a ride back with Cliff, why? - You know why, Rikki. You've been stealing from me, Rikki. You've taken a cut off every shipment for the last six months! - That's bullshit, Reyes! [tense synthesizer music] You know it is. - Finish it! - You lying son of a bit [gasps]! [tense synthesizer music] [knife squishing] [tense synthesizer music] - [Klausmann] Come on, do something! - I will. Real soon, now. - That's enough. I want to talk to you first thing in the morning. - Yeah, you owe me money, Reyes! [Reyes speaking foreign language] [engines rumbling] [rhythmic Latin folk music] [soldiers shouting] [dogs barking over tense synthesizer music] [fabric ripping] [dogs barking] [man shouting in foreign language] [dogs barking] [bag crinkling] [dog barking] [man gasping over cracking strikes] [dog barking] [man gasps] [liquid bubbling] [dogs barking over tense synthesizer music] [man gasps] [dogs barking over tense synthesizer music] [liquid bubbling] [dogs barking over tense synthesizer music] [liquid bubbling] [man gasping for breath] - Get to work! - [Man On PA] Get to work! [birds cawing] - There won't be an election. - I hope. - Still, with Marcelo stirring up the students and workers, there's bound to be strikes, riots. - And the generals will have to step in. - When the army takes over, you'll need my cooperation. Otherwise, your problems are only beginning. - I can take care of my own problems. You remember that. - And you remember this, Gonzalo. Las Palmas is my territory. - But you are on my territory now, Lujan! One word from me and you are dead! Your corpse will fertilize the coca crop! It will save us some horse shit. [birds chirping] [chair creaking] Put the damn thing out! Do you want to blow us all to hell? [cigarette hissing] We will discuss this further at the polo game, Mario, hmm? - Of course, Gonzalo. That is the way gentlemen do business. [footsteps clacking] - How are you, Cliff? - You owe me for the last shipment, Reyes. 100 grand. - How would you like to make twice that much in a few hours? Marcelo Villalba. A big mouth leader of the Social Party. He writes for a newspaper, a little rag called El Diario. A troublemaker. - Yeah? So what? - You're going to kill him. [Cliff scoffs] - I don't think so. - I'm ordering you. - I fly for you, Reyes! That's it. Why don't you call Klausmann, he's your trained Doberman Pinscher. - You don't have a choice. I've got your plane. - Oh, I'll get my plane. And I'm also gonna get all the money you owe me. - [Reyes] And how do you propose to do that? - You just keep right on fucking with me, Reyes, and you'll find out. [birds chirping] [bag crinkling] - [Klausmann] For this paste, 90 a kilo. - Lujan pays 100. - Forget Lujan, 90 a kilo. - No sense in wasting the trip, I'll take it. [Bailey speaking foreign language] - Smart boy! - People who sell to Lujan, accidents happen to them. - [chuckling] You're an accident, my friend. You can ask your mother. Cliff, how're they hanging? - What are you doing here? [strike thwacking] [Klausmann gasps] - Rikki wasn't ripping Reyes off. You were, you and your pal, Wilhelm. When Reyes got suspicious, you framed Rikki for the job. [strike thudding] [kick thudding] [punch thwacking] [Wilhelm thuds to ground] Give me a ride to Urubamba? - Yeah, well, hop in. [engine rumbling] - If he talks to Reyes, you and I are dead! Get to Urubamba. - I take care of the bastard. - He knows you. You find Miguel, give him 5000. - And what about Bailey? - Get going, I will take care of Bailey. Oswaldo, Oswaldo! [crowd chattering over pleasant Latin folk music] - Cliff, keep your pecker dry. [metal clanging] [engine rumbling] [crowd chattering over pleasant Latin folk music] - Muchas gracias, senora. - Take my Rolex, best price anywhere. - I got flake or rock, take your pick. - Jorge, come on! - Hey, Gringo, look. [gun clicking] [gun cocking] - No thanks. [pleasant Latin folk music] [foreign language chatter] [hooves clopping] [pleasant Latin folk music] [slap thwacking] - Cliff! - Hey, Kenny. - How you doin'? - [Cliff] Still flying for big bills. - [Kenny] Still flying. [crowd shouting] [chickens clucking] [crowd shouting] [pleasant Latin folk music] [arcade games beeping and buzzing] - Que tal, Cliff? - Bien. - How goes it, amigo? - Remember those two packages I gave you? - Sure. [arcade games buzzing] - [gasps] I'm gonna need 'em. - I'll fetch 'em before you leave. [tense synthesizer music] [gunshot cracking] [glass shattering] [strike thwacking] [glass shattering] Goddammit, Cliff, that window cost me 200 bucks, special order! [chickens clucking] What am I supposed to do with it? - Make it into a lamp. Picked the wrong mean son of a bitch! I don't like it when people point guns at me. Makes me a little crazy [laughs]. - Hey Ace, buy a girl a drink? [expressive synthesizer music] Cliff? - What are you doing here? - What about that drink? - Yeah. Kinda thirsty. [glasses thwacking on counter] [crowd chattering] - Yes? Dammit! - I'm surprised you even bothered to look me up. - Don't flatter yourself, Ace. I've been here five weeks already. I'm on a story, six parts. - Coke. - Good guess. [Cliff scoffs] So, you still working for Reyes, congratulations. You must be very rich by now. - Yeah, I get by. - Maybe you can get me an interview with him. - [laughs] He and I aren't exactly on the best of terms at the moment. As a matter of fact, he just sent me a message. I sent it back. Come on, I need a lift into Las Palmas. - I gotta talk to some people first. [crowd chattering] - Fine by me. [bottlecap tinging] - Ah, take it easy, Ace. [paper crinkling] Call me. [crowd chattering] - Yeah. Maybe I will. [engine rumbling] - Keep moving. [tense synthesizer music] - I never run over a good looking broad. It's against my religion. - Give us a lift? - I'll give ya a lift! - Move this shitcan! - Gimme the money! [tense synthesizer music] Don't even think about saying it! I hate it when guys say, "What money?" [tense synthesizer music] - You are a stupid son of a bitch. [strike thwacking] [gunshots rumbling] [engine rumbling] - So long, sucker! [engine rumbling] [tense synthesizer music] [footsteps clacking] [crowd chanting] [Cliff scoffs] [Cliff sighs] - What is it? - It's an old family heirloom. [crowd chanting] [Franco speaking in foreign language] - Move it, out! - Franco, put this stuff somewhere safe for me, you know what I mean? - Mm, mas o menos. - Mas o menos! [Cliff sighs] [chuckles] Suddenly, it all becomes crystal clear, ey? [crowd clapping and chanting] - [MC] I give you the leader of the Social Party, Marcelo Villarba! [crowd cheering] [crowd chanting and cheering] - The government of the Social Party will be a government of the people, and the first act of our government will be to stop those responsible for the exploitation of the people! [crowd cheering] They allow the corrupters, the parasite, the bloodsuckers! [camera snapping] But we do not fear to speak their names. [crowd cheering] Gonzalo Reyes! [crowd jeering] Gonzalo Reyes, a man who has sold the very good name, the very soul of our nation for a handful of cocaine and a fistful of dollars! [crowd shouting] Mario Esujer Lujan! [crowd shouting] [tense synthesizer music] [soldier speaking in foreign language] Mario Lujan, who auctions off of the laws of our nation to the highest bidder! [guns rattling] Mario Lujan, our valiant Chief of the National Police! [footsteps clacking] We will make some federal constables move! We will exterminate the knightly generals, the coke leaders! [crowd shouting] The germs that feed on our nation's pride! [tense synthesizer music] [crowd shouting] [placard thwacking] [crowd shouting over tense synthesizer music] [footsteps thwacking] [tense synthesizer music] [strikes thudding] [bag thwacking] [tense synthesizer music] [strike thudding] [man shouting] [tense synthesizer music] [strikes thudding] [tense synthesizer music] [doors crunching] [engines rumbling] [tense synthesizer music] [door crunching] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [tires screeching] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [tires screeching] [engines rumbling] [tires squealing] [men groaning] [tense synthesizer music] - Out, get out, come on! [tense synthesizer music] Come on, quit it, get out from there! Come on, woof woof! Come on, come on you! Move it! [tires screeching] [tense synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] [gunshots cracking] [bullets tinging] - Marcelo! [engine rumbling] - Forget it! [tense synthesizer music] [doors crunching] [engines rumbling] [tires screeching over tense synthesizer music] [engines rumbling] [wood rattling] - Turn! [tires screeching] [tense synthesizer music] [car crunching] [metal crunching and rattling] [Marcelo sighs] [Marcelo chuckles] [gasps] It won't go well for you if Lujan's people find me here. - Just keep still. [doorbell buzzing] [sighs] Cliff! - [sighs] Oh, maybe expecting somebody else? So, this is where an American reporter lives in Las Palmas. - [Janet] Si. - Very nice! - [Janet] This is Marcelo. - Yeah, I know, I heard his speech this evening. - [Marcelo] And? - You didn't get very far. - Maybe another time, you have a chance to hear the rest. - Maybe. - Take care, Marcelo. [lips smacking] - Perhaps we'll see each other again. [footsteps clacking] [tense synthesizer music] - All right. [phone rattling] [footsteps clacking] Senor Reyes? It was Wilhelm on the phone. He shadowed Cliff to a house in Las Palmas. 10 minutes after Cliff went in, Marcelo came out. - Cliff! The double-crossing son of a bitch! What the hell is he trying to pull? - He's crazy, and there is only one cure for that sort of craziness. - Marcelo is a friend. He's one of the good guys. - I thought all you reporters were supposed to be neutral. [photo thwacking] - Captain Coke! - [scoffs] You know I don't have to take this anymore. - Sit down. [Cliff sighs] Sit down, you're giving me a stiff neck. [pack crinkling] Dear old Cliff. [lighter snapping] [expressive piano music] I got it in Caracas off some kid in the street, two bucks. I wonder where he stole it from. [expressive piano music] I thought you'd like it. - I keep it because it helps me remember. - You played so tough back then. You didn't need anybody. - [laughs] I needed you. Just never could seem to find the words to tell you. [expressive piano music] [lips smacking] Problem? - Uh-huh. - Still the same old Cliff? - That's the problem. - [sighs] Yeah. [door rattling] [sighs] You may never see me again. - I loved you, Cliff, I just despise what you're doing. I still do. [lips smacking] [door creaking] [footsteps clacking] [menacing synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] [tires screeching] [engine rumbling] [tires screeching] [engine rumbling] [tires squealing] [tense synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] [chains rattling] [tires screeching] [Cliff thuds onto hood] [engine rumbling] [tires screeching] [Wilhelm gasping] [engine rumbling] [Wilhelm shouts] [car crunching] [explosion rumbling] [tense synthesizer music] [explosion rumbling] [tense synthesizer music] What happened? [fire crackling] - Somebody took a wrong turn. [fire crackling] [birds chirping] - Wilhelm is dead. - Goddammit! - I was wrong! - [speaking foreign language], hmm? - And make it right! - [Man On Phone] Miami. [door rattling] - [sighs] Yes, Cliff, get me Mario, would ya? Listen, they had Rikki killed! Yeah, that's right, so you think you can get him on the damn phone? Thank you! [sighs] Frank, now, Frank, I need to, what, what are you talkin' about, Frank? Frank, for, for Christ's sake, I got it stickin' out, and you wanna break it off! You, well, Frank, I'm the one that's down here! Eh, Frank, Frank, would you listen to me first. Frank, I'm in too deep, it's goin' down now! [phone rattling] [Cliff sighs] [phones ringing] - It's set, 20 minutes. - Great, where? - I'll let you know when we get there. But here's ground rule number one, Ace, I get first shot at the story. [crowd murmuring] First shot! [phones ringing] There's Marcelo now. [engine rumbling] [window creaking] Cliff? - Yeah. - Are you all right? - Hmm? Oh yeah, yeah. [paper crinkling] Great [sighs]. [sighs] Did I tell you that Reyes offered me 200,000 bucks to kill that guy? Let's go. [door crunching] [footsteps clacking] - [Janet] Marcelo. - Hello. [lips smacking] - How would you like to nail Reyes to the wall? - I'd like that very much. - Merry Christmas. [paper crinkling] [paper rustling] [Marcelo gasps] - [Janet] What is it? - A list of Reyes' partners in Miami. A few of the Cubanos, and so on. - [Janet] Let me see. - Names, dates, places, mierda! Where did you get this? - [Cliff] Oh, I collected it in my spare time. Every young boy needs a hobby. - [Marcelo] There's enough evidence here to put this man away! Reyes will have no customers. [papers crinkling] - Reyes will need no customers, Reyes'll be dead. These men don't fool around! - Are you giving this to me? - [laughs] No, no, no-no-no-no. This is my insurance policy. As long as I've got it, he can't afford to kill me. What you get is a story. - What about me? [muffled shouting] [footsteps clacking] - All right, uh, Marcelo, I think you should have-- - What about me? - Janet, look, this thing is not over yet. When I get through with these papers, you can have 'em. Do anything you want to them. Write your goddamn story! But until I give you the green light, it's my game, my court, and my rules. You got it? - Are you finished? - Yeah. - I'm in. - Marcelo? - What do you want me to do? - Uh, here, print that on the front page of your newspaper tomorrow. I'll take it from there. Adolfo, how are you doing? [muffled thudding] [Cliff sighs] - Cliff, aw! [pleasant keyboard music] Cliff, you never asked for me, Cliff. - No one's asked for you since 1962, Chica! - You slut! - At your service, from five to five. - It's a new floor show, Cliff. How do you like it? [pleasant keyboard music] - Great, me gusta. You, uh, have a little accident, did ya? - Well, it was no accident. - No, no thanks. Bailey, don't you think you're getting a little bit too old for this line of work? Maybe you oughta quit, move back to the States. - You're late! You little creep! - Oh, my darling! - I hope you brought me something! [pleasant keyboard music] - So how's your, uh, your buddy Lujan doing? - Lujan's been firing up the army boys, and they wanna run the whole shebang. [muffled rustling] - Why don't you give them a call for me? - Aw, you creep! [whip cracking] Stand up! [whip cracking] Heel! Come on! - I like to see a girl who enjoys her work. Cliff, I got a few bad habits, but I ain't dumb. I know what happened with Rikki. That information is cheap in this town. I got a feeling there's a, there's a shitstorm coming down. Huh, I don't wanna get caught in the middle. Maybe you're right. Maybe I oughta quit. - Maybe I can help you out. [crowd murmuring] - Bring me the telephone, Chica. - Dial this, chico. - [growls] That's the best telephone booth in Las Palmas! [lips smacking] [both chuckling] - Miami, International Press. Si, gracias. Lenny? - Your men find what was left of Wilhem last night? - What do you know about that? [ping pong ball clacking] - Oh, not much, tried to kill me. I wouldn't let him. [ping pong ball clacking] - You know I could arrest you for murder? - Yeah, but you wouldn't do that to me. I'm afraid you'll kiss me on both cheeks and award me the Croix de Guerre. How'd you like to put Reyes in a hole he'll never climb out of? - Lenny, listen to me now. This is totally embargoed until I give you the word. Do you hear me? - Why would you help me? - [scoffs] For the money, 'cause I'm holding an auction, and you're gonna wanna bid. - Could I? - Oh, yeah. You'll know the first thing in the morning, my friend. I'll be in touch. Yeah, get him on the phone, would ya? Listen, you know who this is, asshole, so just get him on the damn phone, all right? A-ha, Reyes [chuckles]! You know, I've been feeling a little bad about our relationship lately. We don't seem to be getting along, so I decided to send you a little love letter. That's right. Why don't you take a look at the cover of El Diario tomorrow. [phone rattling] - Cliff? - [Cliff] Hmm? [Cliff sighs] - Why did you fly for Reyes? - Uh, researching my autobiography. - Oh, yeah, what's it called? - God Is My Copilot. [Cliff laughs] - You owe me some answers. Cliff, what are you doing? - My job. You remember when Rikki and I bought into that air taxi service? - Sure. And Gonzalo Reyes Jr. was one of your regular charters. I thought-- - You thought that I was suckin' up to the kid so that I could make some real money flying coke for his old man, right? [lighter snapping] - You're DEA. - You're right, undercover. [Cliff snickers] - Why didn't you tell me? - Because you never asked me. [liquid bubbling] [chuckles] Come on, Janet! You know I couldn't tell you. [Cliff sighs] [glass clanging] - What happens now? - [scoffs] Well, according to the agency, nothing happens now. [sighs] I've been pulled off the case until after the elections. - Oh, there won't be any elections. Lujan will see to that. - Not if I can see to Lujan first. - This is just like Marcelo said. They sit around playing politics and Reyes keeps sucking his country dry. - He's filling our country full of shit. - He's got to be stopped. - Stopped, hell, he's gotta be destroyed. [sighs] Looks like I'm elected. - Got my vote. - Hmm. [cigarette hissing] You know, uh, I wasn't quite finished with that. [Janet gasps] - Yeah, you were. [expressive synthesizer music] [Janet gasping] [hooves clopping] [tense synthesizer music] - You goddamn bastard! [paper thwacking] - Cliff, it's Senor Reyes. - Yeah, well, tell him to hold his water. - [Franco] Just a moment, Mr. Reyes. Just a moment, please. - Franco, here, I want you to put this back to bed for me, okay? Yeah. [tense synthesizer music] [phone rattling] Hello? - We should talk this over, Cliff. Reasonably, like men. - Like men [chuckles]? What I want you to keep in mind, Reyes, is that I set myself up a deadfall. Anything happens to me, you're gonna be swimmin' in shit! - Cliff, don't do anything we'll both regret. Can you come out? Two o'clock. - Okay, I'll meet you at two o'clock. - Yes, that's fine. [tense synthesizer music] - Yes, Cliff, of course. Very interesting! Six o'clock this evening. Yes, yes, I'll be in touch. Ruiz, stakeout the men across the street from the Boulevard Hotel. I want to know as soon as the Americano Cliff goes out. - Yes, my general. [birds chirping] [sheep bleating] [engine rumbling] - Come out! [engine rumbling] [door crunching] [engine rumbling] [tires squealing] [punch thwacking] [gun clangs to ground] [tense synthesizer music] - Uh-uh, no fighting in front of my place. It scares the customers. [tense synthesizer music] [gun thwacking] You keep giving me guns, Cliff. Maybe I ought to open a shop on the side. - Why don't you just make it into another lamp? [door crunching] [engine rumbling] [bell clanging] [men shouting over clopping hooves] [bats thwacking over playful synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] Klausmann's afraid I'm gonna tell Reyes he was ripping him off. [engine rumbling] - Maybe you should set his mind at ease. [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [horn beeping] [tires screeching] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [metal crunching] [engines rumbling] [tires screeching] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [metal crunching] [engines rumbling] [tires screeching] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [metal crunching] [tires squealing] [metal crunching] [tires screeching] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [tires squealing] [tense synthesizer music] [water splashing] [engines rumbling] [tires screeching] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [players shouting over playful synthesizer music] - Fine. [players chattering] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [metal crunching] [tires screeching] [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [metal crunching] [tires screeching] [metal crunching] [engines rumbling] [metal crunching] [tires screeching] - All right, now! [metal crunching] Get closer. [engines rumbling over tense synthesizer music] [Klausmann gasps] [engines rumbling] All right, Klausmann! [Cliff gasps] [Klausmann shouting desperately] [metal crunching and crashing] [explosion rumbling] [tense synthesizer music] [fire crackling over tense synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] It's all right, Reyes is expecting me. Open up. - Who is she? - My Aunt Irene from Odessa. I promised her I'd show her the sights, now come on! - Smartass, huh? [engine rumbling] [players shouting] [engine rumbling] [players chattering over tense synthesizer music] [camera snapping] [Reyes shouting] [camera snapping] [whistle screeching] [camera snapping] [horse whinneying] [camera snapping over tense synthesizer music] - It's over! [whistle screeching] [tense synthesizer music] [camera snapping] Who are you? - My name is Janet Meade, Senor Reyes. - What are you doing here? - I'm a reporter, International Press. I'd like to speak with you about certain-- - La camera! [horse sighs] - Wait a minute, Senor Reyes, I'm here for a legitimate interview. - You want an interview? - Si. - Okay, interview Rosita, she was Miss San Pedro 1983. [birds chirping] - Goddamn reporters, huh? [scoffs] Oh, by the way, I killed Klausmann on the way over here, I hope you don't mind. So how's Gonzalo Junior doing? Is he still knockin' up gringas at the University of Miami? - Leave my son out of this. - All right, all right. I just thought that, uh, maybe Maranetti's men might wanna look him up. [birds chirping] [footsteps crunching] [can snapping] [Cliff chuckles] - What do you want? [liquid bubbling] - I want my plane and the money you owe me. - Ah, 100,000? - [chuckles] No, that was before. The price has gone up since then. See, your boys have had two shots at me already, Reyes. Then there's Rikki, I kind of like the idea of his folks getting a little something, you know? Let's say, uh, two million dollars. - I don't have that kind of cash on hand. - Bullshit, Reyes. A little friendly advice, don't fuck with me right now. I got you by the short hairs, pal, and I'm about to start pluckin'. - How can I be sure that you-- - You can't. - All right. All right. One of my men will meet you with the money-- - I'll tell you when, and I'll tell you where. [can thwacking] Ciao! [slap thwacking] [birds chirping] [tense synthesizer music] [Cliff sighs] [objects rattling on floor] [tense synthesizer music] [Cliff laughing and sighing] [tense synthesizer music] [phone rattling] [tense synthesizer music] [boot thwacking] - [Lujan] Cliff? - That's right, yeah, listen, Lujan. I wish to report a crime. - [Lujan] Really? - Yeah! Somebody broke into my hotel room at the Boulevard. - [Lujan] Hmm. - Yeah, it's an awful mess. All of my clean shirts got wrinkled. Did you find what you want, you son of a bitch? - It doesn't cost anything to try. - [chuckles] Well, my friend, you see, that's where you're wrong. Reyes already bid two million, but I'm raising the price 'cause you pissed me off. - Ah, come on, Cliff! - How about 2.5? - Cliff [sighs], that's getting too expensive. - Tough shit! Listen, you get it up by eight o'clock, or you're gonna miss the chance of a lifetime. [phone rattling] [pleasant violin music] - Oh [sighs], I knew you would come back to me! - Where's Bailey, Lola? - He'll be back. A drink? - Yeah, fine, fine. - Mm-hmm. [Cliff sighs] - Lola, forget the drink. Turn that up. [pleasant violin music] - This special report from Miami courtesy of USA Network News. - Drug Enforcement Administration agents today raided this building, arresting five men and seizing nearly 500 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $7 million. Kathy Heron in West Palm Beach-- - Come on, keep it down, would ya? - [Kathy] This is the home of Carlo Maranetti, the Cuban mafia boss arrested this afternoon-- - Silencio! [violin rattling] - [Kathy] Has moved a copyrighted story by correspondent Janet Meade-- - Oh, Lenny, you son of a bitch! - Maranetti to Gonzalo Reyes, alleged to be the largest cocaine exporter in South America. - Dammit, Janet! [phone rattling] [phone ringing] [swing creaking] [tense synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] [tense synthesizer music] [muffled telephone ringing] [tense synthesizer music] [phone line buzzing] [phone rattling] - Cliff! - Lola, when Bailey gets back, I want you to tell him to stay put and straight till he hears from me, all right? [footsteps clacking] [door rattling] Marcelo? [tense synthesizer music] Marcelo? [ominous and tense synthesizer music] Marcelo? - Cliff, look out! [tense synthesizer music] [footsteps clacking] - When we didn't find the stuff in your room, I figured Marcelo had it after all. I was wrong, nobody's perfect. Let's go! [strike thudding] [tense synthesizer music] If you won't tell me where those papers are, then I'll enjoy finding out! - Fuck you. [strike cracking] [tense synthesizer music] [footsteps clacking] [menacing synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] - Taxi! [tires screeching] [menacing synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] [menacing synthesizer music] [door clanking] [menacing synthesizer music] [water dripping] [footsteps clacking] [water dripping] [metal rattling] [menacing synthesizer music] [Cliff gasping] [Cliff sighs] [slap cracking] [Cliff gasping over tense and menacing synthesizer music] - Get up! - [Goon] Vamos! [kick thwacking] [Cliff gasping] [chair rattling] [Cliff gasping] [strike cracking] [kick thudding] [footsteps clacking] [tires screeching] [footsteps clacking over tense synthesizer music] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [Janet gasps] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [gunshot cracking] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [strike thudding] [man clacking down stairs] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [slap cracking] [tense synthesizer music] - Okay, once more. Where are those papers? - I forget. - Are you sure? - Positive. [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [water splashing] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] - Where's Hernando? - I don't know. [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [strikes thudding] [thug groans] [plug clacking] [switch clicking] [electricity humming] - Perhaps this will help your memory. [electricity humming] [Cliff gasps] [Cliff shouts in agony] [electricity buzzing] [Cliff shouting in agony over electricity buzzing] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [footsteps clacking] [strikes thudding] [thug screaming] [wood rattling] [tense and menacing synthesizer music] - [gasps] Hernando! Gringo Bailey, do you know where I can find him? - [Hernando] Come with me. - Ah, no, another way. - Yes. [tense and menacing synthesizer music] [strike cracking] [Janet screaming and gasping] - [Thug] Stupid asshole! [doors crunching] - Can you understand me? [Cliff gasping] - Yes [sighs]. [Cliff coughing] - Look at this. [water dripping] Cliff, I give up, I'm going to kill you. Talk [Cliff sighs] or die. [gun cocking] - I'll talk. [strike thudding] [gunshots cracking over tense synthesizer music] Drop it! Take those cuffs off. Tell him! [skin crunching] [Lujan groans] You tell him or I swear to Christ I'll break it right off! - Do as he says! [Lujan groans] [keys jingling] [cuffs rattling] - Come here, come on! [Lujan groaning over tense synthesizer music] Now turn around. [strike thudding] Marcelo? [keys jingling] Get out! [tense synthesizer music] [engine rumbling] [tires screeching] Now! [Lujan shouting] [glass shattering] [echoed groaning over tense synthesizer music] [Cliff sighs] - Is this is the way that you call a taxi in your country? [tense synthesizer music] - [Bailey] Sure, sure, when? When for God, ho! He just walked in, thanks for calling, kid. [phone rattling] - Hey, look, we gotta talk. [footsteps thudding] - Did you have an accident? - This was no accident. [patrons chattering] [door rattling] - Que pasa? [Lola gasps] - Sorry, Lola. - Oh, Cliff, uh, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, I just need to use your room for a couple of minutes, okay? - Sure, sure, just a few minutes, huh? - Rapido, rapido! Gracias! [door thuds] [Cliff sighs] - His friend, uh, Hernando, called. Gomez has got Janet. I'm sorry, Cliff. - [sighs] Shit! [rag thwacking] [pack crinkling] - No. [Cliff sighs] - Marcelo [sighs], I want you to stay here at least till tomorrow morning. Keep an eye on him, would ya, Bailey? Franco at the Boulevard's got my package with all the stuff on Reyes. Go ahead and take it, Marcelo, it's yours.
