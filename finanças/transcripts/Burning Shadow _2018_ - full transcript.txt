(ETHEREAL MUSIC) (ENERGETIC PERCUSSION) (CAR HORNS HONKING) (INTRIGUING MUSIC) HOODED MAN: Can you spare a whiskey for a blind man? (CHUCKLES) I've got something better for you than that. (BANGING ON DOOR) You gonna pay me this morning, like you promised? Mrs. Rattisburg, you woke me up. I'm not even dressed yet. Like I care. Open the door. I'll be out in a minute. You pay me know, or when you leave, I'm comin' in, and I'm gonna take everything out and throw it on the street. I will pay you. I'll stop by your office on my out. You do that. (MOODY MUSIC) (CHATTERING) That's just the way that it is. Okay? Listen. I got two words for you: Simon Rodia. Little Italian guy who built these big towers in Watts. All right? He had no crew, he had no scaffolding, he had no power tools. Okay? You got the half of the population of El Salvador over there. Okay? Get it done! And fuck you! Contractors. How are you today, Mr. Jones? I'm great! How are you, Charlie? Good. - The usual? - Yes. Listen, would you have them put a little more cheese on it today for me? For sure. Sorry about yesterday. How 'bout you, sir? Ronald doesn't eat. That can't be healthy. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) The fuck is she doing here? Okay. Okay. (INTRIGUING MUSIC) Hey! Hey. You have a light? It's 9:00 in the morning, Summer. SUMMER: Can we talk? Not here. Oh, thank you very much, Charlie. Will you be joining them, miss? No. Actually, I'm on my way out. How 'bout a fresh coffee on the house, then? Thanks. Stop by the club. We'll talk. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. You're quite the ladies' man. I didn't really know that side of you. Oh, I do like beautiful girls. It's just that they don't like me. You know, it's all about confidence. Confidence. Charlie, that's the main thing. Yeah, I know. Maybe I should ask her out, then. Nah. I don't think so. But I do like that move with the coffee. That was... pretty smooth. Very smooth, Charlie. Oh. Enjoy. (UNEASY MUSIC) BARTENDER: Another round? No, not tonight. A New Year's resolution, huh? I see a rose and a new jack. Who's the lucky lady? (CHUCKLES) No one. We actually just met. Beautiful? Like you wouldn't believe. Good for you. Will you put that on my tab? I will not! (CHUCKLES) It's on the house. Look... we may not be the classiest joint, but we stand for lovin' here. I'm not really a bartender, you know. You're not? No, I'm... more of a philosopher. Well, at least I think I am. I mean, don't get me wrong. I still make the best cocktails in town, but... it's not all I'm about. I'm a lot like you, Charlie. There's more to me than meets the eye. You're a veteran, too? BARTENDER: That's one way to put it. Army? (CHUCKLES) My friend, the way I see this world is like a big, beautiful poem. Some rhymes you keep, some rhymes, well, you cut. Some rhymes... (POURING) they just need a little extra help. Thanks. Have a good night. Hey... You forgot something. (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) (ANXIOUS MUSIC) I think I'm falling in love with you. CHARLIE: Excuse me, do you have an extra cigarette? Sure. Thank you. I know you, right? I don't think so. Yeah, you came into my restaurant yesterday with Mr. Jones. Oh yeah. Thanks for the coffee. You're welcome. The jerk who ordered it just had to wait a little longer. I hope he wasn't too upset. No. I was that jerk. Say, would you like to grab a drink sometime? You'll have to ask Jones about it. Boss... I was wondering if I could get my pay today? Does it look like fucking Friday to you? Because it looks like fucking Tuesday to me. But maybe I'm wrong. Let's look at the calendar. Oh! It think it's Tuesday, too. So why should I pay you today? (SIGHS) You don't even do what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to serve and clean. Okay? Do you know how many cockroaches I found last week in the food? Three! Not one, three! You are so lucky to have this job, you know that? Yes. You know what your problem is, Charlie? You smell like shit. But... it's not a figure of speech. You actually smell like shit. I don't want to be mean. I really don't want to be mean, but you... you make me mean! It's your fault, it's your fault! Bitch. Trust me, I want to pay you. I know what your friend does for a living. He's not my friend. And he doesn't do it for a living. I pay him... but it's not the reason that he does it. Come on, man! It's me, Mickey. You known me a long time. Listen... It's not like you caught me running away. I came to you! I always pay my debts. Ask around. But you gotta give me one more week. That fucking lawyer's shaving me! What would it be... What it would be if I was really guilty, right? I'm gonna take your silence as a yes. Come by the store when you can. I'll set aside two big Angus steaks for you. That meat is so tender, it feels like a 15-year-old's pussy. I'm gonna get you the money. (ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC) Thank you, Charlie. You're welcome. Hey, why don't you sit down and join me? You know, I'd love to, but I'm on the clock. My buddy said you would join me. Come on. I guess a quick sit wouldn't hurt. Sit down and have a sip. In fact, let me pour it for you. Do you need room for cream? CHARLIE: No, I take my coffee black. Just black. I understand that you came by my club. Your club? I thought your club wasn't open yet. My club. You came by my club. I don't think I did, no. You know, I'm from the East Coast, and I really miss the seasons. California has no seasons to speak of. But I really miss winter, and fall, and spring. I think most of all I miss summer. Summer. Summer. Because summer... it's really hot. But it's a different kind of heat than you got going on here. It's really kind of a moist, humid kind of wet... summer. Is this about Summer? (INTENSE MUSIC) (EMOTIONAL CHORAL MUSIC) SUMMER: What are you doing here? Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Are you following me? Oh, no, nothing like that. Mr. Jones gave me your address. I doubt that. He told me to wait for you here. Where is he? I guess he's still at his club. It's just that you told me talk to him the other day, so I did. And he said that it's up to you, so he told me to wait here and see what you say. I've got money, you know, 400 bucks, just like he said. Don't pull it out here. Sorry. Listen, if this isn't a good time, and you're beat up or something, I can always come back another time, not a problem. SUMMER: It's okay. This is a nice place. Yeah. I'm house sitting for the mother of a friend. Oh, you can put it there. Maybe... I don't know, maybe we could talk first. How about you take a shower first? It's over there. A shower. Yeah, sure. I'll wait for you in the bedroom. (SHOWER POURING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (BREATHING HEAVILY) I'm a vet, you know. A lot of guys... they come back from war, and they have someone waiting for them. They used to say that's how they got through it. Sometimes I envied them. I'd steal their letters and pretend they were for me. Oh man, I would have loved that. I don't know how I got through it. I guess I just got lucky. People don't know. They can never know. But it's strange... Now that I met you, I feel like everything's gonna be okay. And I know it sounds stupid, but who knows? Maybe this was God's plan all along. Maybe you're my angel. I think I'm falling in love with you. (INTENSE MUSIC) (SHOWER RUNNING) (CRYING SOFTLY) Hey. I've got to go to an appointment. I really need you to go. Sure, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. It's just that last night was so... About that. I... I don't know what happened last night, but it's not gonna happen again. You should go home. Now. Charlie, right? Yes. I'm sure we had a great time, but I need you to go home and forget about it, okay? And you can't say anything to Jones. He'd kill you, or have Ronald kill you. Just go to work and pretend it never happened. Okay? I don't think I can do that. Please. Just get out now. Where the hell were you? I had to open myself! Sorry, my mother was sick. I don't give a shit about your mother. Get the fuck behind the counter and make some fresh coffee! You know, this is the last time you're late. Okay? This is the first time I've ever been late. You're gonna answer me now? Sorry. It won't happen again, Mrs. Looper. No, it won't. (ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC) BARTENDER: You doin' all right, buddy? Gimme a double. What happened to the romantic guy? I'm out of luck, man. Did you ever have any? My, my, my. I've been watching you for a long time, Charlie. And I think that you are one of these people who are responsible for their own problems. But... you're also your own solution. What the fuck are you talking about? Now, I know I'm supposed to be a good bartender here, cheer you up. But like I told you, I'm more of a philosopher. Let me ask you a question. Do you really think it was bad luck, or bad decisions? When you've got nothing but shit and dirt to choose from, it doesn't really matter which way you go. Fair enough. But... if you saw your luck in front of you, would you realize it? You'd be surprised how many people don't. I guess it'd be surprising enough to be noticeable. Good answer. Now... And this is a very, very important question. If luck finally came your way, would you do good with it, or bad? I'd do good with it, you can bet on it. (CHUCKLES) I'll take that bet. I'm gonna give you something. It's a gift, but you're gonna have to give it back to me. I sure hope it's money you're talking about. Oh, it's better than money. Nothing's better than money. Some things are. This one is. It's my good lunch charm. And I'm guessing you need it more than I do right now. A good luck charm? There's a little more to it than that. Ta-da. That's what's supposed to save my life? Take it, will you. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) It doesn't even seem to work. It'll move when it needs to. Take you under my wing! (THUMPING) (GRUNTING) This is how you repay me, huh? You fuckin' steal from me? I fuckin' knew it! This is fuckin' mine! Fuck you, Big Joe! You're on your own now! Let's see how that feels, - huh? - Hey! Stop it! I'm callin' the cops! Hey, man, are you okay? HOODED MAN: Where are my fuckin' sunglasses? Here. Come on, man. Let's get up. Come on, you're okay. (CURIOUS MUSIC) Charlie? What's up Charlie? You seem somewhere else today. Really? It's nothing, just thinking. Yeah, about what? It's stupid, really. Come on, Charlie, you got my curious now. Okay. Do you think we all have a double somewhere in the world, Mr. Jones? Someone who looks exactly like us? Well, Charlie, there are some ancient religions who believe in that. I'm not religious, but... Yeah, they have a word for it. They call it the doppelganger. Now, they think that these two souls, if they confront each other, they destroy each other, they can't coexist. But, you know, I happen to think that we always see our double if we drink too much. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, that might be. So, what's going on, Charlie? Do you think that you've seen your doppelganger? Oh, no. I just saw a TV show last night, and it had me thinking. I got your message, you wanted to see me? Oh yeah, I just... wanted to make sure that you were okay... Summer. Why don't you just sit down and have a little coffee with me. I'll have the... cappuccino. You two know each other, don't you? Sure. Hi. I offered you a coffee, and you offered me a cigarette the other day. Remember? I guess we're even then. Okay. I'll have the cappuccino. How old are you, Summer? 27. JONES: Let's hope you make it to 28. (SOFT ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) You wanna steal my shit? I'll cut your fuckin' throat off! I don't wanna steal anything from you. I helped you yesterday, remember? That guy was beating you up good. Oh. What do you want? Nothing. I just wanna give you a few bucks. I didn't have anything on me yesterday. Thanks. Now leave me alone. (CASUAL PIANO MUSIC) (CRYING SOFTLY) You havin' a shitty day? Havin' a shitty life. How's my good luck charm workin' for you? Well... I seem to be even more depressed, so... I guess it's working fantastic. Sarcasm is the prerogative of an imbecile. I asked you a very simple question the other day. If luck finally came your way, would you realize it? Your answer was yes, but your behavior with luck proved you wrong. What the hell are you talking about? Luck... did come your way, Charlie, and you failed to realize it. I can't do that for you. I can show you the path, but I can't walk it. You have to do that yourself. Otherwise, you might as well give me my watch back right now. I'm wondering if I'm not wasting my time on you, Charlie. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hey. You again. What do you want? What do say about spending the night in some clean sheets? What are you, a sissy? You gonna fuck me, is that it? No, no, I don't want anything, especially not that. I just thought maybe you might need a place to stay for the night. Who the fuck are you? Mother Teresa? It's just an offer, and it's about to expire. You know what, nevermind. This clean bed... What do I have to do for it? Take a shower. I don't want that stink in my sheets. And get rid of that cart. I can't do that. You sure play hard-to-get for a bum. What's your name? They call me Big Joe. I'm Charlie. You got my money? Listen, Mrs. Rattisburg, I don't want any bad feelings between us. I didn't get paid today. My boss didn't show up. I'll get paid in the morning, but I don't think burning any more of my stuff will help. You'll pay me in the morning? For sure. Okay. But don't take advantage of my kindness. I won't. (SOFT MUSIC) Did anybody see you? How the fuck would I know? If they did, they just saw a bum near a dumpster. Man, you're not coming into my room smelling like that. There's a shower right here. There's soap and shampoo. I suggest you use both. Fuck you. (SHOWER GUSHING) Good morning. Where's my shank? It's right there on the table, but I'd rather you don't use it in here. Where's my stuff? CHARLIE: It's in the bathroom. Okay. I'm gonna get going. You can stay a few more days, but you're gonna have to follow some rules. Like what? First, don't steal anything. Don't invite any of your little friends in. And don't leave until I come back from work tonight. If my landlord sees you, we're both out. All right. There's a TV right here behind you. There's some sandwiches in the fridge. Don't touch the beer. If you can't follow these rules, get out now. I'll be good. Promise. Joe, why are you here? You invited me, remember? No, I mean, how did you end up right here, right behind my place? It's a long story. A sad one, too. Let's just say my folks didn't think a blind kid was a blessing. I don't blame them. Can I ask you a question, too? Why are you helping me? I don't have time to answer that. I'm running late for work. I have a day off this weekend. We'll talk then. (ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC) Oh! Nice flowers. Got somethin' to apologize for there, buddy? Yeah, something like that. Good luck with that one. (CHUCKLES) Baby, come on. You know there's no free rides. This is from last week. What's paying this week? Come on. I'll pay you next week. I always pay you. Summer, I'm not into paying next week business. I'm in the I get you high as a motherfucker business. You know, forget it. Every one of you junkies... Please, honey, please. The body system, huh? All right, why not? Not on the lips. Like I care. (CHUCKLES) (CRYING) (WAILS) Have a seat, Charlie. Thanks for seeing me, Mr. Jones. I must say, I'm rather surprised. I didn't think you were the type. You're right, I'm not. It's just .. Well... You've got to make me want to help you. That's what you're here for, right? It's just... my mom's sick. She needs a kidney transplant, and the insurance company won't pay for it. They say it's not an emergency, but... she's in so much pain. If she doesn't get it, she's gonna die. How much do you need, Charlie? $38,900. $40,000? That's very touching, Charlie. Your mother has raised a very good son. And I certainly appreciate your motivation. But I've gotta ask, how are you gonna pay me back? Your yearly salary is hardly enough. She sold her apartment in Tempe. It's nothing fancy, but it's worth $80,000. She gets the money from the escrow on the 3rd of October, only it might be too late for the surgery. You're a vet, right, Charlie? Yes, sir. Army. Where? Afghanistan. Two deployments. JONES: Why? Didn't have no better place to go. I hoped it'd help me get to college. So... Did you go to college? My father was a vet. (SOFT MUSIC) He fought in World War II. They told him it was the war to end all wars, and that his kids would never have to fight. Well... We're stilL fighting, right, Charlie? This war thing, it just goes on and on. My father was shot in the leg on that beach in Normandy, and he walked with a limp for the rest of his life. And when my father got cancer... the great big country... turned its back on him. He died. When I was just 10. You know something, Charlie? I'm not going to turn my back on you today, because my father would like that. But you listen to me. I want you to know what the stakes are. Because... what you're risking is a lot bigger than what I'm risking. You look different. Mrs. Rattisburg... Here's the $352 that I owe. And this... is for your troubles. Good lord. (CLATTERING) (GROANS) Fuck! Ass! I told you to stay away from the fucking booze! You're crazy. It's like tellin' a kid there's treats in the closet but don't eat them. You're either an idiot or a sadistic prick. And I'm thinking sadistic prick. I don't wanna fight you. I'm in a good. I got a raise. Halle-fucking-lujah. (CHUCKLES) Did you buy more booze? Fuck no! JOE: Wine? Pepperoni pizza and Dr. Pepper. Put some clothes on your fucking ass! You're ruining my appetite. Put this on. This thing's too small for me. No, it's not. It fits me perfectly, and we're the same exact size. Give it back to me. Maybe you were my size 10 years ago. That's probably how long you've had that thing. So... Are you gonna finally tell me why you're so nice to me? You wanna actually here my plan, or are you gonna just keep asking me the same question over and over again? I'm all ears. Well, first we're gonna shave that disgusting beard. Then I'm gonna help get you some new clothes and find you a job. That all? Actually, no, that's not all. I have a little bit of money. It's not a lot, but... it's enough to help get you back on your feet. I don't believe anybody wants to hire a blind bum. And I'm not shaving my beard. That beard either belongs to a homeless man or Santa, and I don't believe they're gonna take you for Santa. I don't know how to... Let's just avoid that part, okay? Whatever you say, boss. You know what? Let's take a picture to celebrate. (CAMERA BEEPS) All right. Do you mind smiling for me, at least? All right, here we go. (CAMERA BEEPS AND CLICKS) (CAMERA BEEPS AND WHIRS) It looks really good. I wish you could see it, actually. Fuck you. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (WATCH WHIRRING) Hey, welcome to Peeps. $20. (INTENSE MUSIC) I will take you out of here. (ENERGETIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (SNORING) (CURIOUS MUSIC) BARTENDER: If luck finally came your way, would you do good with it, or bad? You behaved. I've done a lot of thinking. About what you said. CHARLIE: Yeah? How could you possibly get me a job? I mean... what kind of job would that be? There's actually one job a blind man can do better than any normal person. Sucking your balls. (CHUCKLING) Dude, Joe, attitude. You say one thing like that in the real world and you'll get your ass fired. Street reflex. Sorry, boss. Those guys who tune the pianos. I heard they're blind as fucking shit. Couldn't tell the difference between their moms and a dead lizard. I wanna give you something in return. What the hell? No, thank you. Keep that thing away from me. I wouldn't be surprised if a cockroach crawled out of it. Fuck you. A bartender gave it to me the other day. I don't trust those fuckin' cashiers to tell me I won. Those cocksuckers would lie to my ass and cash out the money themselves. They probably would. I trust you. If we win, we split it 50-50. Funny, it's only odd numbers. It's an odd world. It sure is. We'll take care of that beard tomorrow. I'll stab you first. What's your story, anyway, Joe? I ran away. CHARLIE: How come? I had to. My father's a crazy bastard. Violent? One day at school, I got beat up by these two kids. My dad came in to pick me up at the principal's office. And he was mad. Embarrassed that his son couldn't stand up for himself. He drove me down from school to the border to meet with his friends. Didn't know what the fuck was gonna happen. I was scared like shit. When he got out of the van, he gave me a rifle. Said today was the day I'll become a man. What happened? Then I heard noises. People. Mexicans crossing the border. I even heard a child crying. And my scumbag father forced his blind kid to shoot. Said if I didn't shoot, he'd shoot me. I hope he rots in hell. (UNEASY MUSIC) Boss, do you mind if I listen to some TV? I don't feel sleepy. Sure, Joe. (GENTLE MUSIC) I think I'm falling in love with you. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Would you do good with it or evil? No, no, no! What the fuck? I just wanted to see your face. Don't fuckin' touch me, okay? You must be damn ugly if you don't want me to see you. No, I just don't wanna a fucking bum touching me, all right? What is it? You look like the Elephant Man or something? No, I have a normal fucking face, just like you! How would you feel if you woke up and some fucking naked guy was all over you, touching you? You'd probably use your fucking shank on him! I'm goin' to work. I'll see you later. (EMOTIONAL MUSIC) Hey, Charlie, are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine. All right, I gotta go. Have a good night. Hey, Charlie... Hey. Hey. How's moms doing? Yeah, she's doing good. She gets her surgery next Tuesday. Wow. Next Tuesday? Hey, I'd really love a photograph of her that I could put up on the wall. For sure. She would be happy to do it. Good. You know, I have my good days. (CHUCKLING) Most... Fuck that. All of my clients wanna borrow money because they want something flashy, because they want, you know, to gamble, they want a new Rolex for their mistresses. But there's only one person who has ever asked for money for someone else, someone else in need, and I want that photograph to be put on my wall, because I want that photograph to remind me that there is good in this world, Charlie, there is good in this world, and this world is not all evil, Charlie. There is absolutely good in this world. Do you understand what I'm saying, Charlie? You're right. Get me the photograph. Please. For sure, Mr. Jones. Thank you. It's amazing. Absolutely amazing what you have chosen to do. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Joe? Hey, Joe, are you in here? Joe? Joe! Where the fuck did he go? Where the fuck did he go? Fuck, fuck, fuck! Is that you, boss? Where have you been? I've searched everywhere for you? I just wanted to get some fresh air. You know, kinda got claustrophobic in there all by myself. Let's get you back inside before my landlord sees you. Come on. Listen... Today's the big day. We're gonna get you clean and shaved. And I've got a present for you. I bought you some new clothes. Did we win the lottery? I don't know, I forgot to check. I'll do it tomorrow. But what counts is that, tonight, you're gonna be a new man. (LAUGHING) You make it sound scary. Don't move. I'm gonna feel naked without my beard. It was keeping me war... You moved! Look, now I cut you. Sorry. I won't move. What? I'm pretty? At least, you're clean, and you look 100 years younger. (SCISSORS SNIPPING) JOE: You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Stay here, okay? When I tell you to, come out. I want to be surprised. See you like I don't know you and you're coming for a job interview. Okay, come out. Weird. It feels like someone else's face. You look great. There's some clothes there on the bed. Sit down and try them on. Can I have some privacy? You've been naked in front of me all week. Maybe. But now that I'm a new man, it feels weird. I'm not going anywhere. Do you have anything that doesn't belong to your little sister. That doesn't make any sense. Those are the right size. I must be bigger than you think. Try this on. All right. I'm not Pretty Woman. You made your point. No need to humiliate me. You look great. You sure you're not blind too, boss? Boss? (GASPING) (UNSETTLING MUSIC) (WATCH WHIRRING) Where's Charlie? It's weird, he called me the other night to say he was quitting, but really I fired him. What a relief. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Oh, shit. Who the fuck is this guy? "Tired of this life. "Charlie." He thought this guy was his doppelganger? (CAMERA BEEPING) Yeah, he's all yours. But I doubt if we'll ever see him again. He could be anywhere by now. I know where he is. (MOVING VOCAL MUSIC) (PHONE BUZZING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) CHARLIE: Summer, it's me, Charlie. I need to talk to you. It's urgent. Can I come in, please? What are you doing here? I told you not to come. It's a long story. I need to come in to tell you. Listen, I've got enough money to take you out of here. Please just let me in. Let me put something on. Thanks for letting me in. Can I have a seat? I'm exhausted. Sure. Tell me why you're here. My luck has turned. And I wanna give you some money. To escape your life. Your job. Everything. I guess I'm kinda doing that myself. So I thought maybe I would enjoy the ride better if I had someone to share it with. Someone who deserves better than the shit he's been served. Someone like you, Summer. I've got 40 grand. You deserve it as much as me. We've both been fucked by all the Mr. Joneses of this world. I don't know. Maybe it's time you and I settled the score. I don't know what to say, Charlie. You're asking me to trust you. But what happen when you get tired of me? People get tired, you know? They say they won't, but they do. I didn't come to America by myself. I followed someone. And I ended up alone. That won't happen with me. That's exactly what he said. You seem like a nice person, Charlie. I can see something good in you. And I don't want to ruin it. Somehow, everything around me always gets shattered. I will never stop. (MOVING VOCAL MUSIC) (UNEASY MUSIC) Charlie. Charlie, Charlie. Why? I've seen it all. I've heard it all. But this is just about it, Charlie. Why? I... I... You what? Got money. What money, Charlie? Shit is crazy, Charlie. And you know what the craziest part of this is? You went to Summer's house after you guillotined that guy and... It doesn't make any sense. What did you expect? Why, Charlie? Oh my god, I guess I'll never know. I'll never know. CHARLIE: No, no. (POURING) No. Do you really think it was bad luck, or bad decisions? (LIGHTER FLICKS) If you saw your luck in front of you, would you realize it? You'd be surprised how many people don't? JOE: I want to give you something. The bartender gave it to me the other day. And now, and this is a very, very important question, if luck finally came your way, would you do good with it, or bad? (FIRES WHOOSHING) (CHARLIE SCREAMING) JONES: Goodbye, Charlie. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (BLOWS) What a waste. (ETHEREAL MUSIC)
