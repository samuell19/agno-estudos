Going through the city for almost 10 years, 13 years, at least, being as a freak. It was really the challenge I tried to overcome, because in all fairness, by 1962, every friend of mine and every relative had given up on me. They would come into my mother's house and just shake their head when they saw me and walk the other way. That's amazing. That's why I believe you're talking to the biggest miracle perhaps ever in the history of show business, because while there were people who did suffer hard and starve and went through all this, they never had to go through the art of being a freak, and make it at the same time. I don't know anyone who has done it. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Tiny Tim! Ladies and gentlemen... - The one and only... - New York City's own... - Tiny Tim! - Tiny Tim! Tiny Tim! Dear Lord, today I had an awful day. I am the biggest star in the country. What I have is desired by almost everyone, and yet, oh blessed Lord, my soul is dwelling in Hell, and I cry out for help, oh Jesus. ♪ When you're strange ♪ ♪ Faces come out of the rain ♪ ♪ When you're strange ♪ ♪ No one remembers your name ♪ Tiny Tim's on next! ♪ When you're strange ♪ Who is this? Where did he come from? Who dropped him here? His sexual ambiguity, political ambiguity, ethnic ambiguity, it's all ambiguous with Tiny Tim. I feel like someone from Mars come to Earth. He took all the male female adult child and just kind of put it into a blender and hit the button. And then I immediately thought that's the man I want to marry. ♪ Strange ♪ ♪ I treasure the grace of her sweet smiling face ♪ ♪ The Bible my mother left for me ♪ Tiny's widow is here. My name is Johnny Pineapple. I was Tiny's closest friend, and we're actually in the middle of shooting a documentary. Oh my gosh. So this is very exciting that in the time of your loss, you know, are here for a funeral, but God bless you, decided to come down and just see where Tiny is resting. Let me show you. Come on in. He was born Herbert Butros Khaury. And of course everybody knows him as Tiny Tim. Is he from here? Good question. Actually he was a New York City guy, born and raised in New York City in 1932. When you look at where Herbert Khaury begins and Tiny Tim ends, nothing was ever normal from top to bottom, from start to finish. So why should his birth be normal? If they had waited to do that cesarean another minute or two, he would have lived out his life in the rehabilitation hospital, in a wheelchair or in bed. His mother Tillie is from a Russian Jewish family, and his father, Butros, is from a Lebanese Christian family. That was unheard of, especially a Jew marrying an Arab in those days was pretty unusual. He had a violent relationship with mom and dad. They had him, they took care of him. I don't think they ever loved him. Tiny described to me many times my parents' room had no door. There was no door on their room. No door. And he was agitated. And he couldn't leave his room without walking into their private space. He had Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby, Arthur Godfrey, and his ukulele. He would play them 30 times a night, and it would turn him on so. ♪ Like a shivered sea ♪ ♪ I'm just lost in a fog ♪ ♪ My mind is hazy ♪ ♪ My thoughts are blue ♪ ♪ Guess I'll always be ♪ ♪ Kind of lost in the park without you ♪ ♪ Waiting night and day ♪ ♪ Like a bump on a log ♪ ♪ I'm going crazy ♪ ♪ Why can't you ♪ ♪ Help me find my life ♪ ♪ Because I'm ♪ Herbert! His parents were elderly, and they really tolerated him, but they didn't understand him, so he locked himself in his room, and in his imagination, with another life, invented his reality, invented people in his loneliness to take him away from that spot. Had a violent clash with my mother. She broke my records and my mandolin. I was thrown out of the house and stood in the cold rain for three hours. Was a particularly rough time in his life. His parents are getting ready to throw him out of the house. He wasn't making any money. He decided he had to do something, so he took the subway down to the financial district, sat on the sidewalk with a sign help save classical music. ♪ Was a lovely April shower ♪ ♪ It was the most haunting and dark ♪ You prick! The first time I saw Herbert was when he was standing on the street with his ukulele. He really enjoyed it. Fuck you! ♪ I hung around til three or four ♪ They got mad because he was so damn weird, and all they wanted to do was kill him, throw eggs at him, garbage cans, anything. Get fucking wrecked, you faggot! Another wasted day of my life has passed. All in all, today was just another day of thinking. Will I be a success in singing? What is my future? However, my main objective is to be self-confident with girls. My father insisted today that I see a psychiatrist, but I said Jesus Christ is my doctor. ♪ I had a crazy feeling ♪ ♪ The first time we met ♪ What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick, a sickness of the mind. You see, Ralph was a homosexual. Tiny was what I call half-gay, which means that his problem had more to do with identity than with sexual preference, and he had when he was young a relationship for about five years with a guy, and it was just a romanticized friendship. Bobby Gonsalves came in. Praise the Lord. And of course, I was admiring his body, muscles, using myself as a punching bag, which is wonderful. This is good and bad points about Bobby Gonsalves from the diaries. Bobby Gonsalves, good points, his kind heart, his sincerity, his honesty, his tender gentle love for the poor, his always telling the truth, his warm smile of love. Well what is the bad points? Bad points. Zero. You didn't know that he saw so much in you? No. No, I really didn't. Hmm. What do you think about it? I'm a little shocked. Bobby Gonsalves came. He said he was sleeping over. He took his pants and shirt and glasses off. I closed the light and also went to bed with him. I massaged his back. He fell asleep. Dad came into my room, put the lights on, and almost blew a fuse when he saw Bob, who was still asleep. I tried to assure him, but finally Ma came in, saw Bob, and boom! That was it. Out he went, and I got hit, yelling, et cetera. I went to the pastor to tell him my views on my belief in Christ. He told me to see a psychiatrist. Then I was kicked out of the Catholic church for being a smart Alec. Everyone is against me. ♪ People are queer ♪ ♪ They're always glowing, scrambling ♪ His biggest conviction was you gotta do something to get noticed. ♪ And dress themselves this way ♪ There's a great photo of Tiny Tim by Diane Arbus that really has the genesis of the look. It's beautiful and shocking. It has so many elements of what really makes something last. It's a unique beauty, his character. It's not typical beauty, by any means. But it's beautiful in that he created it, you know. It's a miracle, really. The fellows kidded me about my sissy-ish appearance, but the girls looked at me. And then one day he says he prayed to Jesus and he woke up with the high voice. ♪ Mary Lou ♪ ♪ Mary Lou ♪ ♪ Cross my heart ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ Today I tried my new style at the old Alliance Club. It worked. Praise the blessed Lord Jesus, they screamed. I must sing the sissy way. God told me to sing the sissy way. Thanks ever so much for the magnetism onstage that you've given me. Today I had to be taken to safety by two cops and a fireman. I believe, however, this is the start of a great success. So Tiny basically went through the 50s playing at all these amateur singing contests, and all these little dive bars, maybe making a few dollars here and there, but actually didn't land his first steady gig until 1959 and that was at Hubert's Museum and Flea Circus, which was essentially a freak show located in Times Square. I don't like to use the word freaks, so I'll just use the oddities of nature, and the main act was fleas dance to music. How do you train them? Well, we have to form habits in them. Larry is Napolean bonafide with his cannons and Caesar with their Roman chariots. All right, boys. And he found himself billed alongside the armless wonder, the handless sharp shooter, elephant man, and whatever else they had in there. And he was billed as Larry Love, the human canary. ♪ Open the page of a book and all ♪ ♪ Brings back a memory of days of Yore ♪ ♪ Only a rose leaf that lingers ♪ It was no doubt humiliating in some way. I mean, people came through not to enjoy these people, but to gawk at them. A lot of the prescribed routes for us to live and interact with one another were considered artificial, were considered mannered, as if people were walking around with masks and playing roles. And this is the way women are supposed to behave, and this is what being a man is about. There had to be a break, like a new generation was coming in with completely different ideas. People who were reaching to be something individual were valued and appreciated for being just that. And in that sense, Tiny Tim was one of those people, and therefore he was a trailblazer. Praise the Lord. I was mentioned in the Village Voice under the name Tiny Tim. We have a different kind of music for you right now. A different kind of personality. This gentleman is very, very quickly picking up a following. And let's have a great big hand for Mr. Tiny Tim. I was wandering by this club in the West Village, and in there I saw Tiny Tim. Who cooked my brain. And there was some women and some men, and lights went out. I hope you'll approve this song, my dear friends, because if you don't I'm very sorry, because these are one of these numbers that catch me at this time of night. And in that silence and darkness suddenly you could hear ukulele. ♪ When I have brand new hairdo ♪ ♪ And my eyelashes are in curl ♪ ♪ Well I float like the clouds on air do ♪ ♪ I enjoy being a girl ♪ Who is this?

Thank you for the wonderful talent he sees in me. To be a close friend of him, to stay and sleep in his house, well this was too much. And to top it all, he is paying me for it. Thanks as I also sang for his beautiful wife and kids. Dylan was sort of interested in doing a film, I kind of was involved in it, in which we were gonna do a circus, and Tiny Tim was gonna be the guy with the top hat and the whip. People were talking about it a lot but it never got off the ground. He was a complete outlaw. A complete outlaw. So it made him very vulnerable, but very interesting. You really liked him a lot.

People were ready to accept him. We didn't treat him cartoony. We treated him like a real pop singer, like Frank Sinatra. A real singer, like a real artist. Tiny showed up at our office one day with a shopping bag and with his ukulele underneath his arm, and I did not know what to make of him. The only thing he kept doing was this oh, Mr. Deblasio, Mr. Deblasio, thank you, thank you. And I couldn't figure it out. And I was told by Roy, he said to me, now listen, this one is crazy. And I said well, you know, they're all sort of crazy. Every one of them. He said no, you don't understand. This one is truly wacko. I said wacko? And he said wacko. ♪ I'm right here to stay ♪ ♪ When I'm old and gray ♪ I was in the middle of a writer's meeting and Richard Perry walked in with Digby Wolfe and said we wanna introduce you to somebody.

I got a surprise for you. Oh, you're kidding. You got a goodie for me so early in the evening? Wait'll you see this. So we brought him out onstage and we introduced him, Dan introduced him to Dick, and Dick had never seen anything like Tiny Tim.

A lot of our fans wanna know how old are you, Tiny Tim? Oh, mystery! I feel so young! I also know that you admire the astronauts, or was it that you would like to be one?

That's a hell of a Russ Columbo style, right? Mixed with Mr. Crosby. Yeah. Very good. I think you took everybody a little bit by surprise on that one. Right? He was a great performer, and he was passionate about his music, but he was more passionate about girls. On the first of January to the last day of December I give a trophy out to the most beautiful girl of the year who I've met. And I like to give a lot of trophies out, but of course I can only give one. Usually the girl never knows it. Have you ever thought of replacing the trophy with a ring, or marriage... Never! Never. Because I could never get married. He'd tell us stories about girls he had crushes on. Yes, which was a lot. A lot of girls. And one time he was getting so excited, I don't know if you remember, Ms. Cleo, he was telling us all about Ms. Cleo who was a showgirl somewhere, and all of a sudden he's going oh, Ms. Cleo, Ms. Cleo! And he jumps on the bed on his back, and he's kicking his feet and his arms, and it's Ms. Cleo! He was going like out of his mind. If you could imagine being like 15 years old and seeing it, you know. I think I was on the second floor, he was on the third, and obviously we were close. He climbed down the balcony and he snuck in through the sliding glass doors and came into my room. And his road manager, he just kept calling, and he said I know Tiny is in the room with you. He said this is not wise. In the meantime, Tiny is saying don't tell him I'm here. Don't tell him I'm here. I was like, what do I do? But I listened to Tiny. And then he snuck out the same way. People always thought that he was some kind of lech, but with us, I mean, he was just this great, he was great. He never did anything. He was so sweet. I thought it was cool. And it could've been something else, but it wasn't. It wasn't. And he was such the gentleman. Always, anytime I was with him, always the gentleman. How many times realistically did he get that close to serious, serious legal ramifications. In certain places he could've gotten into a lot of trouble just for... Hey, no kidding. Just for having her there with no clothes on. Not that she had much choice, since she walked in and took the clothes off without asking him. Remember in Iowa. Tiny is approached by some, you know... He told me, that was... 13, 14 year old girl in Iowa. Yeah. And unbeknownst to Tiny... She's recording the telephone conversations. Yes. And then her dad... And it's getting. - Bingo. - Ugh. Dad gets a hold of it. Dad goes crazy. But there again was another situation where there could have been serious ramifications. I don't know whether it's illegal to talk to a 14 year old girl on the phone. You couldn't get in trouble for that. And the same, like talking on the phone to a girl, depends on what they talked about, but... It was very sexual. Oh. Oh, Tiny. I think that Tiny got more titillated by the temptation and the fact that this was sinful, or it was potentially sinful. I hate to think this, but he was probably a little bit of a tortured soul in that way. Dear Lord, please forgive me for the sin I committed with Ms. Candy here at Caesar's Palace, as I spread honey and peanut butter on her body. Kissed Ms. Trisha, fooled around with Ms. Carol. Put cold cream on Ms. Iris. Got wet. Ms. Karen, might marry her. Temptations were active, and save me from sin. In Jesus' name I pray. I must stop this sin, and I will with Thy strength. ♪ With you ♪ We all felt that he definitely did need an anchor, and hopefully he would find a nice girl, maybe develop a relationship. So when we went on a book tour, she happened to be there at Wanamaker's department store. I noticed her right away in her gray dress. And as soon as I came up there, my eyes started to swoon. And then I looked at the crowd, I looked back, and there she was again, I looked back, there she was again, and she was still smiling. It was pretty incredible. It was like love at first sight. - Yeah. - I was there, yeah. And the next time I came back to Philadelphia two days later, she came down, she asked me for the address. She's here now. Miss Vicki. Dear Tiny Tim. I'm lost without you. I miss you. There's no one but you. Dear Miss Vicki, thank you so much for sending me the most exciting telegram I have ever received, but I am more lost without you than you will ever be without me. Tiny Tim. There's nothing, just nothing without you. There can never, ever be anyone but you. Dear Miss Vicki, I am thinking of you more than you will ever think of me. All the silent objects are my witnesses. This must be the last time I will be ever be separated from you. Thanks again, Tiny Tim. Vicki, was it love at first sight? Um... It was really love at first fright. No, don't say that!

And after so many years of making his own decisions, Tiny began to resent people telling him what to do, so he alienated Richard Perry, Richard Perry quit, followed by Ron DeBlasio, and Tiny was taken over by less experienced managers who decided to go down the route of branding Tiny Tim and Miss Vicki together as a package. ♪ I love you and you love me ♪ ♪ We love each other dear forever ♪ Thank you, as Miss Vicki gave birth to a baby girl early this morning.

And I think the reason why is because from a very young age, I always had negative stories about him from my mother, so because of that it stuck in my mind. Maybe at times I even felt embarrassed.

He couldn't really relate to other people. His experiences as a child with his parents, it wasn't good. And I don't think he learned the capacity to love. You know, he signed a contract with the mob, and they were controlling him. Tiny definitely more than alluded to that. He would say I've got the big boys. He called them the big boys. One of these mafia people said okay that's it, I'm taking it over. I'm your new manager. That was mainly it. Show business was very mobbed-up back then. Of course, they controlled Las Vegas, vending machines and jukeboxes and nightclubs. They had booking agencies. Everybody was saying who is this guy? Including the FBI. So they launched an investigation, and they were particularly interested if Tiny was connected to hoodlum associates connected to Frank Sinatra, basically. Night out at the Whisky A Go Go.

She's out for this, like he was so mean. He hated me. Then Tiny would come to me and tell me these things, like, he said oh you're no good, and you just want what you can get, and you just want money, and I'm like, well did you stick up for me?

But at that time, I'll be waiting, I don't believe in divorce. And of course if she comes back 20 years from now, fine. Under my terms, of course. And basically... Can I ask what the terms are? Yes, frankly, some of the terms will be she has to take a blood test. During this time, Tiny's management, they were trying all kinds of new things to jumpstart his career. Well we do all benefits for the police and the firemen all over, New York area, Massachusets, Connecticut. And we also bring monkeys, chimpanzees, and magical acts with us, and jugglers. And on the road I've also seen some wonderful talent like Mr. John McCormick, the toothless opera singer. Ah! Ah, now that, now you're talking. I consider it a very sad story, because the way he was introduced and put immediately like a freak. They didn't understand his genius, and I think they were into something else that had nothing to do with that, and it was actually heartbreaking for me because I knew what he was.

Our very special guest star here under the big tarp, truly one of the entertainment world's most colorful and unique personalities, the one and only Tiny Tim! There must be changes in my career. I must make it either in records, movies, or television, or not at all. The way I am handled right now by people who just want to grab any engagement they can from me so they can put a dollar in their pocket, even at the loss of the talent you've given me, oh Lord. Thank you beautiful Mr. Wall for bringing me out here. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, so thrilling to be here today in beautiful... I'm the first has-been star singer who has ever sung with the circus. Elvis Presley sung with the circus but that was before he became a star. You say has-been star. What was it like for you to go up to the top and be married on Johnny Carson broadcast, and then to do whatever's happened to you, of which I'm not totally familiar. Great question. It's really down, up, and down. It was fantastic. It was a great trip, and of course for 17 years I've been trying to make it back again. Yeah.

Flood getting nearer. Electricity out. Water contaminated. How many lives were made more beautiful because they were broken? God loves you. He's got a plan. I can't do it alone anymore. Get help. I was 12. And I had 55 pictures of him on my wall. I had always felt like I didn't really belong in this world, and when I was a little kid I had a fantasy that I was from another planet, and when I saw him I thought he's the first person I've ever seen who's from my planet. Well, I hadn't much thought about Tiny for a long time. I'd heard he was getting a divorce. And all of a sudden I realized Tiny travels around and plays small places, and I could meet him if I wanted to. I just called the hotel that was mentioned in the article and invited myself to meet him. He says are you attractive? And I thought, it's a really inappropriate thing to say. And I thought I should be angry, but I'm not. It was just awkward and just wrong to say that, but I just wanted to laugh. And I said I suppose. And he said, are you slim? That's even worse. And I was very thin at the time, and I said yes. And he goes, well okay. And we set a time and a place, and I said we'll be there. And he goes who's we? And I said me and my boyfriend. He goes, oh honey. And I said I've waited 26 years to meet you and I'm going to be there. And he says, all right. And he hangs up on me. And that was our first conversation. And my boyfriend said to me you're still in love with him. And I said oh, no. I said you know, he's old, and raggedy-looking in the picture. And I said it's not gonna be the same. And he goes uh-huh, uh-huh. And when I met him he was to come down from his room at the Hotel Fort Des Moine, and we were gonna have dinner. I didn't realize at the time how little money he had, and what a huge sacrifice it was for him to buy dinner for two guests. And he says are you Miss Sue? And I said yes. And he says hi, I'm Tiny Tim. And I thought, yes. I knew that. He's looking me up and down, and he's giving me this look like, you really aren't that attractive. And I'm looking at him like you are so old and you look a stuffed animal that some little kid has been playing with a lot for about 10 years. And then I noticed that he was looking at me like well maybe you're not that bad. Maybe you're kind of cute. And then within two or three minutes the whole deal was done. Without a word ever being said about it it was just like this is obvious. This is going to happen. And Dennis said to me, he says so that's your dream boy? And I just looked at him like, yeah. ♪ Once I lived a life of a millionaire ♪ ♪ Had lots of money ♪ ♪ Didn't have a care ♪ ♪ Carried my friends out for a good time ♪ ♪ Buying bootleg liquor ♪ ♪ Champagne and wine ♪ That's it.

I'd like to present to you Mr. and Mrs. Khaury. ♪ Thou's the one I love ♪ ♪ Sweet Sue ♪ ♪ That's you ♪ By the time he married his third wife, Sue Gardner, the national spotlight had long faded. In recent years, Tim had found new popularity among the retro music crowd. I don't know how many people have ever had an opportunity to see a living legend. Ladies and gentlemen! The one and only! Let's have a big round of applause for Tiny Timbo! ♪ Sweet Sue ♪ ♪ Sweet Sue ♪ The first time he got looked at medically after we met, they said that they thought he had five to seven years. And then he started to get worse, and they started to talk about three to five years. And then they started talking about one to three years. And in the end, the doctor said I cannot guarantee that he will walk out of the office. Please welcome with me, Mr. Tiny Tim. If you hear any coughing during the show, well it's because, you know... Is there a doctor in the house? When I heard that he had a heart attack I tracked him down in the hospital in Massachusets, and we communicated fairly often the last few months. It became a very warm conclusion. I had wanted him to stay home for a long time. He had promised me. But I didn't realize how addicted he was to performing and to applause and the audience and all that stuff. Tiny! Tiny! Control your destiny, or someone else will. It's not over until I win. I don't know where to start with that day. He colored his hair that day and he was in a horrible mood. Tiny came up these stairs proceeded straight ahead because he was not feeling well that night and he sat down and rested to just take it easy. Tiny Tim Khaury. A small bandstand was set up against this wall, and Tiny was pretty much front and center which would have put him in approximately this position. The set was very short. He did sing another song that I had never heard of. I'll have you to remember when I grow too old to dream, this song will live in my heart, so kiss me my sweet, and so let us part. In which I think he was consciously saying goodbye to me. I think he knew that he was not gonna walk out of that room alive. Miss Sue was sitting way in the rear of the room. And then he sang a very short version of "Tiptoe". ♪ Tiptoe by the window ♪ ♪ By the window ♪ ♪ That is where I'll be ♪ So when Tiny all of a sudden, mm, grabbed his heart, and Sue, as I get it, from the back of the room kind of mouthed to him, are you okay? He kind of went, no. At that point, she got up, charged forward, and that's when he pretty much knew he was collapsing and fell into her arms. And he very gracefully knelt down, and I think that he was gone right then. ♪ It sure is good to see you ♪ ♪ But I would have liked to hold you ♪ An icon of the 60s died this weekend. He tiptoed into America's heart nearly 30 years ago. One of a kind entertainer, and the last sounds he heard were applause. ♪ Perhaps in the next life ♪ ♪ When our roads touch again ♪ ♪ I'll be able to love you ♪ ♪ The way ♪ Eccentricity, idiosyncrasy, quirkiness, Tiny was a genuine joyful pear-shaped celebration of all three. He was perhaps the kindest man I ever met. Tiny, may your good works never die. Some celebrities walk around like they're the sun and the moon, and he just wasn't that way. He was wonderful. I feel like I'm Tiny when I say this, but I feel like his spirit enters me. ♪ Eternal troubadour ♪ ♪ Tiny Tim ♪ He was like a turtle with no shell. He was so honest, he was so open and out there, and he was like a child. I hope that they understand why I am the way I am because I use it as an excuse sometimes. I'll say I can't help it, my dad was Tiny Tim. It's not my fault. He really should get some credit as being the first androgynous rock and roll era star. Particularly in the next generation, people like David Bowie, and Prince, and Boy George, they must have ingested some of Tiny Tim. People either got it or they didn't. There it was.

Neil Cassidy and I kidnapped him from the mafia. Mr. Rocko fell asleep, and we snatched him. We were driving up the west side highway in New York to the Cloisters with Neil Cassidy driving the car, and Neil and Tiny singing Bing Crosby duets as we drove along. Every now and then he'd go, oh Mr. Cassidy, not so fast! Oh relax, Tiny, everything's cool! I'm just gonna roll this joint and drive with my knee. Oh god, what a hoot.
