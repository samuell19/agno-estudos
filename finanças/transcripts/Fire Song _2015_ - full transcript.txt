I don't want everyone looking at me like that. Theyjust wanna help. Come on, it’ll only be an hour. I said I'm not going. What's wrong with you? Who're you trying to impress, anyway? Ah, come on Jacks. -|t's time to go. -Get out. I don't even want you in here. Nobody should be in here! -I won't be long. -Mmm... Jackie. I brought you something. This will keep the bad spirits away. [radio playing] She just needs some time. What your mom needs is a smack. You're gonna be pissed at me now? I'm so sorry, Shane. Thanks, Bev. Morning, everyone. Thank you for coming. Elder Evie couldn’t be here. She was called away this morning. Her grandson David Will say the opening in her place. Ahneen. Boozoo. David Thomas ndishnikaaz. Chi miigwetch to everyone for being here and to the school for remembering Destiny on our last day here. It's been about six weeks since she ah, took her life. I miss her every day. ls Evie still talking like some spirit came after Destiny? It's just... feel like I should have seen something, or known she was gonna do it. It's not your fault. So stop worrying about it. I tried to do it once. Afew years ago. I had a knife in my hand and l was ready to do it It's not the same thing, is it? (Tara) ldon’t know. Well you didn't do it, did you? So it's not the same thing. ljust feel like I know what she was going through so I should have seen something. You weren't even friends. Don't be mad. I'm not mad. Shane. l'll text you later. Is that you? Yeah. What's that? Something I made for Destiny. We need to get out of here. Just me and you. Still going to college? Couple months. At least we’ve got people here. You go down there with your head all fucked up, the city will kill you. Hey, college. How's your mom? She's doing fine. I still have all those roofing supplies for you guys out back. Yeah I think Uncle Pete said he's gonna come pick it up. Is he gonna pay for it too? |'|| ah, I'll tell my mom about it. Okay ah, I'll see you later Janice. -Hey. -Hey. l swung by your place but you weren't there. Just grabbing some food. I heard Albert's sister got your mom's job. Ashley says she sucks. [laughing] I'm gonna get you! You're bad. Everyone already thinks we're fucking. I don't wanna knock you up and get stuck here. Could be worse. I should probably get home before my mom starts to freak out. She shouldn't still be making you do everything. It's been a couple months already. Six weeks. Still, don't you get tired of being good? It wasn’t your fault. Why you gotta touch me all the time? Get the fuck out, pervert! Hey, mom? Roberta said I missed the band funding deadline for school. Can I use my inheritance from dad? Mom? Close the door behind you. Hello. Hey Evie. Uh... why don't you let me take care of that? Ah, no no it's all right. I got it, I got it. Oh that's okay. I, I'll do it. Why don't I come by Friday night and you can take off for a bit? Sure. [music playing] -Hey Robbie... -Uh, can I get two OEs? So I heard Annalise got knocked up. No, really? Since when? It's true. Petey told me yesterday. Must have been some white guy out of Brickport. No one around here wants to touch that skank. That shirt's a bit tight. Don't make me smack you. Now don't drop em. Get outta here now. Bring me a coffee? College! What's goin on? Not much. Me and your girl here are chillin'. She looks pretty good, eh? Better throw some of that my way if you wanna get some tonight. Hey did you hear Annalise got knocked up? You guys got anything to drink? Hey Debbie -- how about cutting us a deal? Bring me a coffee next time and I'll think about it. Come on, Auntie. I know you got money. lpay you enough. Never mind. I got it. I'll be leaving you slackers in the dust once I start making money in the city anyways. Tara, you better watch out none of those college bitches run off with him. I'm gonna be there with him, so they're not gonna get the chance. You got a wife! As if you're gonna leave. Girls like you never leave. Yeah, they'll come back next year all whitewashed and real snobby about everything. Too late. What about you? You graduated high school like what, four years ago now? Still be sittin' on your aunt's couch jerkin' it all day? I got a place in the family business. Whadda you want? Vodka. (Kyle) Yeah, it's about time we got our drink on. (Shane) Is this you saying thanks? That kid is such a fag. Don't say that. It makes you sound like a prick. I don't care. (Kyle) What, me and Shane ain’t your type, medicine man? Nah come on seriously, you're hurting my feelings now. Come on man, don't be such an asshole. Hey David -- why don't you come walk with us for a bit? Why don't you come with us? Nah -- I'm just gonna head home. What's wrong with you? Are you and Tara having sex now? Not even close. Looked pretty close to me. Do I need to prove it to you? Or maybe I should just kiss you. Don't. You drinking with us or what? 'Course he is. I thought medicine men don't drink. Priests aren't supposed to touch little boys either. Fuckin' medicine man. I need more juice. You're alreadyjuiced. So what medicine man, your grandma still talking to ghosts and shit? Shut up Kyle. I'm just sayin'. It's not my problem they don't believe in God. So, I don't believe in God either. Yeah, but we already know you're going to hell. The spirits are real. Ask the old people. (Kyle) Whose old people? My old people say your spirits are just the devil so... what do your old people say about smoking pole? Your spirits watch that too? (Shane) Jesus Christ, Kyle. Shut the fuck up. Nobody wants to hear you two argue about whose fairytales are better. Cheers to that. I need a refill. Don't be cheap. Oh God, I can feel it. What? The spirits. They're coming after us! Oh shit -- | feel it too. Run! [laughing] Don't laugh at me. I could be hurt for all you know. Where's Shane? Shane! I want Shane. I got you. I'm surprised you invited me out. Kyle was just being a dick. You drank all that vodka pretty fast though. Yeah. That was dumb. lfeel like shit now. It was fun though. I got you. You know what, Ash, I got her. Why don't you just head home? I don't need anyone to take me home. I'm not letting you take her home by yourself. I can feel you breathing. Hey! What the fuck are you doing? I don't know. l'm drunk. Go home! I didn't do anything! Is this what you want right now? Go the fuck home. (Shane) I've been carrying this around for a while. I've been meaning to give it to you. l was thinking that maybe you could come with me. There's a Native centre. And there's a gay street. And there's lots... Why do you even want to go there? For school. But really though. I know how things will go if I stay here. ljust wanna go where I can be with you, you know? My nookomis and the elders have been teaching me a lot. So? So, they say that I can make change, do good. They say that to everyone. They tell me that all the time. Maybe it’s true. If you believe that. Well if the best you can do is run away, lfeel sorry for you. You can be so fucking stupid sometimes. Don't fuckin call me stupid. Don't you ever want to get out of here? Not really. And what about all those traditional people find out that you like dick, huh? Think they're gonna let some fag teach them the culture? Where you going? You want a punching bag, go find your fuckin' girlfriend. Who are you? Oh hey girl. Come see your old man for a minute. Is that your daughter? Hey -- I'm your dad's friend, Sherry. From Brickport. You sure she’s your daughter? She doesn't seem like she's any fun. Sure she is. Come here. Come here. Come dance with your dad. Just a little dance. That's my girl. Oh... let me in there. Look at this. Two sexy girls. Hey. Where you goin? I thought we were gonna dance. Where were you? (Shane) You ran away. l was calling for you. ldidn’t hear anything. You tired? Were you serious, when you said you wanted to come to the city with me? Someone's gotta take care of you. Little Nish in the big city. Turn off the light. Are we gonna do this? Do you want to? Yeah I, I guess. lthink so. [both laughing] (Pete) So you don't come home at night now? l was at Kyle's. Did you eat yet? Not yet. (Pete) ljust came from the store. Janice wants to get paid upfront for all the shit you ordered. Why don't you get the band to help? The roof's halfway falling in already. (Pete) They’re broke. They’re always broke. It's gonna be fine. Your mom has enough left over from when your dad died. That money's for school. If I don't pay them this month I'm fucked. Well maybe you should be thinking of taking care of your mom instead of trying to run off. I'm not running anywhere. It's for school. You don't know how good you got it. You're smart, an people like you. You could even get a job at the council, maybe even get something at the mines. What about you? Maybe you should be here taking care of your sister instead of putting it all on me. (Pete) That ain’t myjob. All right. We don't need your help here anyways. So get the fuck out. Good luck finding ten grand anywhere else. Hey Janice. -Want one? -No. You got any work that I could do around here? Yeah, you can clean this shit up. How much? Eighty bucks. Take it or leave it. [knocking] [knocking] Hello? [knocking] (Evie) What’re you locking your door for? There’s nothing to steal. Aaneen. l um, I know you have ah, half of the last one from the last time. I brought some just in case. You didn't have to do that. But I wanted to. I'm not feeling that good today. lthink l'mjust gonna go back to bed. It's no good to be around her things all the time, you know? I'm fine. Are you going to do a giveaway next May? I'm not gonna do that. But you're gonna have to do something. Don't look at me like that. I'm sick and tired of you coming around here pretending like you care about us. Just so you don't feel guilty. I don't like to talk to you when you're like this. If you need anything, you know where | live. (David) What are you doing? What's it look like I'm doing? Working. Are you going to the talking circle tomorrow? You know, it might actually help if you talk about Destiny. Yeah. I could tell everyone I was with my boyfriend when I should have been watching my sister. Oh and just so you know, you're off the hook, all right? I slept with Tara last night, and she's going to come to Toronto with me. What, you're just gonna let me go with her? [banging] Is that too hot? (Jackie) It’s nice. You should call Evie. Okay. I think we're just about done. (Jackie) You’re so good. How did you get to be so good? [drumming/chanting] Hey college boy. When do you want to talk about Toronto? Any time, I guess. l was thinking we should get an apartment way up high so we can see the whole city. Oh and I'll probably have to get a job down there too. Maybe waitressing or something? (Shane) That’d be good. No one? Nobody has anything to say? This is our last circle for Destiny, but we can end early if none of yous want to talk. And then what? Are you sure? You haven't had much to say during our circles. What is the point of this? My cousin Jared killed himself last year. People kill themselves all the time. Nobody cares until they're dead. I'd like all of you to sign these contracts before you leave today. It’s a written promise to remember how important your life is and if you’re ever thinking of hurting yourself, to remember this promise. Okay? Now, buddy up. You're back. I figured I could get a couple hours in. You got something you wanna tell me? Not really. Nothing? Did you take some sheet metal from over there? Shane-- you can't do that. It was back here with all the garbage. I didn't think you would mind. I'm gonna have to let you go. For taking some metal that was just sitting back here? That's not the point. Janice, I need the money. Ladies at the church took up a collection for you and your mom. Thanks. But this gets me nowhere. Janice, the till's stuck again. Just give it a smack! I already did. (Deb) Pretty early for you, college. Kyle texted that you wanted to see me. Yeah I heard you and your mom weren't doing too good. I bet you could use some cash. Maybe. If you get caught selling, that's it for you. No more school. Hey Robbie. You here to pick up for your dad? About how old is Robbie now? I don't know, twelve... thirteen. If I wasn't selling to them, somebody else would. You know what? You don't even deserve this. Fuckin' price list is in the bag. See what you can sell, bring me back the money in two weeks, and I'll cut you in. What's in here? Oxys, weed, crystal. Put that shit away, now. Fuck, get going. How was the circle today? Kyle was being a dick, so Shane took off. You been seeing him a lot lately. It's good to have friends. But too much male energy is no good. There has to be balance. You know that, eh? I know. [thunder rumbling] [water dripping] Don't look at me like that. Someone's gonna see. (Shane) So how much money do you think Evie will give us? (David) Depends on how much rice we bring back. (David) I’ve got some good news for you. (Shane) Well come on, tell me. (David) Later. [sticks tapping together] [TV s h ow] Ashley was just telling us her plans for when she's done school. I'm gonna open a salon at my mom's. Good for you. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Go with Shane to Toronto. What else? Ajob? Girl doesn't need a job. She has a man. Ashley. How did you get yourjob? Well, I went to college in the Sault for a few years after high school, and then university in Toronto. Sounds like a really long time. And you probably need good grades too, eh? Hey. You can do anything, you know? You can. Tara. Hey shorty, what's up? Yo, where's your man at? Not even a kiss? Yo, you better get it before you dry up. Some of those grade eights are looking pretty juicy. Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? I went and saw Debbie the other day. She's getting me to deal for her. Oh come on, don't be like that. I already feel bad enough already. We better get going soon. It's gonna get dark. (David) So, you didn’t ask me about my news. Yeah, so you gonna tell me? l was thinking about coming to Toronto with you. Really? I'm not really honouring my teaching if I can't even be open to who I am here. But... But you shouldn't have to sell drugs to get us there. There's no other way. Well I'm not gonna help you do it. You don’t have to. We still have to tell Tara about us though. Wait until we get the money first. She deserves to know. It won't be much longer. So do you really want to move in with me? -Yeah. -Rea|ly? Yeah. (Tara) Hey guys. Hey. I saw you. Don't look at him. I saw what you were doing. (David) What are you talking about? You were kissing him right here! Holay Tara. Looks like you got the party started a little bit too early. -How much did you have to drink? -|'m not drunk. Come on, why don't you come with us for a bit? Don't touch me. Tara, it doesn't make sense. I'm not crazy David, don't act like I'm crazy. -Maybe we should just... -No. She already knows. Come on, just talk to her when she sobers up. You can'tjust leave. I'm sorry. Please don't leave! [crying] What the fuck was that? David, why wouldn't you let me tell her? Can you stay for a bit? Just get my money so I can go home, please. Thanks. You're not mad at me anymore? Do you think Tara's going to tell anyone? She'll be fine. I'll go over there tomorrow and I'll tell her everything. Everyone's gonna know. It doesn't matter. In a month we'll be in Toronto. Just you and me. [phone vibrating] [phone ringing] [basketball bouncing] (Kyle) You’re not even gonna say hi? You look good. [scoffs] No I don't. Where's Ashley? I don't know. Probably her mom's. Where's Shane? I guess we're both single for the night then. (Kyle) So what do you wanna do? All right, where do you wanna go? I don't care. Well at least tell me what happened. Come on. It's me. You can tell me. You're gonna laugh. I won't. I saw them kissing. Who? Shane. And David. [chuckling] Christ. I'm sorry. | just don't want to be alone. [crying] Hey, It's all right. I'm here. Come on, don't cry. That little shit's always acting like he's better than everybody else. You need a real man. It's okay. Kyle. I know. I know, you're free now. Kyle, stop it. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Get off me. What the fuck did you bring me here for? Trying to slut around to make him jealous? [yells] Stop! Shut the fuck up! [screaming] Stop, stop! Come on, mom. You shouldn't sleep here. My girl must have been so sad. Shhh, come on. Let's get you to bed. How did we not know how sad she was? [sobbing] [knocking] [knocking] [knocking] Come on, Tara. Pick up. Fuck. (Shane) No, no, no! Tara! (1 st officer) Are we done with him? (2nd officer) I told him to wait. (1 st officer) Can we take him home? Shane. Shane! Shane. What? What do you want? Stay the fuck away from me. Close the window, please. Shane. What are you doing? Shane! Is this what it's gonna take? Stop, Shane! Maybe I should just burn it. Stop it. Stop it! That is from her birthday. What is wrong with you? Shane, stop it. Shane! [water dripping] There's no cereal left. So cook something. Don't try to get in my head. Just tell me how I can get some money. I don't think I'd want to be in your head these days. School needs the deposit and I don't have it. I thought you came to talk about Tara. | just need to get the fuck out of here, Berta. I'm trying to help you. No you're not. You're just trying to keep me here, like everyone else. Given what's happened with Tara, I'm probably one of the only people who wanna see you succeed. -Shane. -What? Tara was sexually assaulted before she died. I'm not gonna ask if you were involved. Why not? I don't think you'd do that. I'm sure you wouldn't. ljust need to hear it from you. And you'll believe me. No matter what I say. Hey Robbie. What's up? (Robbie) Not much. Need anything? Not from you. How about you two? (Kyle) Look who it is. You make me sick. What the fuck are you after me for? Fuckin creep! She was my best friend. Just get out of here. (Kyle) Go! (Deb) ’Bout time, college. No coffee this time? What do you want me to do with that? I can't sell it. That's not how it works. No one is buying from me, Deb. You think because you get good grades and you suck a bit of dick, that makes you special? Did Tara tell you that? Word gets around. It was you. You did that to her. -Prove it! -It was him. Look at him. (Deb) l was with my nephew all night. And anybody who says different is a fuckin' liar. [crying] (David) How long have you been here? I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. [sobbing] [phone ringing] (Evie) Hello? Hello? (Evie) David? Yeah. Oh, there you are. Did you ah, talk to Janice about selling the rice at the store? Um, I haven't yet, but I will tomorrow. It'll be like this every night soon. Gimme all your money. Now. (David) What are you doing? Just playing around. You seem better. It's because I'm a genius. [muffled talking] This is such a bad idea. No, it's a great idea. You know she's going to get us, right? When did Shane get here? Uh, it's just me. I thought I heard him in there with you. Nope. Probablyjust the TV. Where you going? Where’s my kiss? (Cashier) It was definitely him. No one's seen Shane since the cops started looking. You just never know, eh? Good kid like that -- everybody's going nuts. You know, you can'tjust go around telling people that. You don't know it was him. Um, I was having a private conversation, Davey. I hope they chop his dick off when they find him. Total's $9.75.. What if she's not there? She could be closed. Sometimes she heads over to Brickport. Let's just go. It'll be fine. Okay. I got it. [knocking] Aaneen. You left the house. Shane's gone. And the police came by... David's gone too. I heard them talking this morning in David's room. Come in. We're not going to find them tonight. So how long do you think this has been going on with them? (Evie) Who knows? It's not right. Creator made men and women different for a reason. It’s to have babies, you know. Well... when he was a boy, this elder in James Bay told me he would be Two Spirited. You never said. l was hoping he would get old enough to get out of here before people found out. You know how people can be. Mmmm. -Pray with me. -No. Just hold it. I can't. lfeel like I'm gonna puke. You're fine. Gimme that. Gross. Thanks. What do you want? Um... Do you have any champagne? I'm not even gonna ask what it's for. Thirty bucks. You got that thirty? Yeah, sorry. -She spilled it. -What? She spilled the fuckin' coffee. Shit. It's okay. -We're still good. -What? We can't do it while she's awake. lt's two against one. What's the worst that can happen? Are you kidding? She knows us. So? She gonna turn us in for robbing her illegal business? This is it. It's just you and me. Okay. But I'm not coming with you to Toronto. -What? -I can't. I'm doing this for us. Well don't do it for me. (Deb) What the fuck’s going on over there? You know what? Fuck it. I thought I told you to piss off. [groans] Open the safe! Open it! [gunshot] Auntie, what the fuck was that!? Gimme the gun! (Deb) Get the fuck off of me! Shane! Let's go! (Deb) Gimme my money! (David) Come on, Shane! Just stay here. [distant sirens] How much did you get? Twenty bucks, maybe? God, lfucked up. No you didn't. No, I did. Fuck! Shane, it's okay. No, it's not. I'm poisonous. l'm fucking poisonous to everyone. -Shane. -Don't touch me. I know you're happy. You win. Nothing ever fucking changes. I'm not happy! [screaming] -Shane. -Don't fucking touch me! Go away! Shane. What are you doing!? I told you to get the fuck out of here! Just go! Go! Go! [splashing] [police radio in background] Are they in the same bed together? Hey Ash. It's too early to see Kyle in lockup if that's what you want. If I wanted to talk to you about something, would you have to take my name or anything? Maybe. Depends on what you want to talk about. I guess I just wanted to give this to somebody. I found it in Kyle's room. It was Tara's. What time is it? It's like, ten-thirty. (David) Looks like you’re giving up. I’ll still help you if you want to keep trying. I'm too fucked up to go down there right now. I better go. If you go out that way, you can't come back. Come on. My nookomis is out there. What are you doing? What does it look like. Go sit down. So did you talk to Janice at the store yet? She's not gonna hold it past today. I'm not paying her. I'm gonna move. I worked it out with Evie and I'm gonna stay with her and David while you're in school. (Shane) You can't just do that. We've lived here forever. But this way you could go to school... (Shane) So what, you’lljust let this place fall in and rot? Nobody gives up their house, mom. You can't. Janice can sell the stuff to someone else, okay? Evie's got room. I can't go. Notjust yet, anyways. Maybe next year or something. The money's there, and it's yours, either way. (Pete) Only one box? -What kind of load is that? -Oh geez. You're so loud, Pete. You got all your books in there and everything? Ah, yep. Just let me go in and check. -Want me to help? -Oh no, I can do this one. Ever lazy, Pete. Just sitting there organizing while everybody else is doing all of the work. Did you get everything? Do you want us to box up all of Destiny's stuff until we do a giveaway? We're not doing a giveaway. [match strikes] You know my son, you can do anything. You can. [wind blowing] J"
