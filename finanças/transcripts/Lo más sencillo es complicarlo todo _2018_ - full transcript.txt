THE SIMPLEST THING IS TO COMPLICATE EVERYTHING Since I was a kid, my parents always told me that life was a great adventure. Actually, I never really understood what they meant... until now. Honey. Get up! You're going to be late for school again. Renata! -What? -Come on! Seriously, why can't we go in around ten or twelve? Why does it have to be so early? I don't know. I'll ask the principal. -Promise? -Promise. Come on, get up. -Renata! -What? Come on! I'm coming. Hey, Tomás. Stop it. You think she'll say yes? -No. -So... You're not missing out on anything. Besides, remember how well it goes when you take a chance. Don't you remember that party we went to with the super sexy French girl? You got there... got up the courage... Zap! -Tell me it wasn't cool. -You were the one that hit on her. -Really? -Yeah, man. Damn, you're right. I forgot how hot she was. With so many RA meds in me, I forget things but hear me out. Ever since I was in elementary school, I was already getting it on. It was probably with the janitor, dude. It was with your sister. I don't even have a sister. Come on, let's play. You don't have a sister? On top of you! -Hi, Dad. -Good morning, princess. Good morning. You know, do we really have to go to school so early every day? Let's see, are you a doctor yet? An architect? -An engineer of some sort? -No. Then I guess you have to go to school every day. -Can't I take a shortcut? -What would be the point? I wouldn't have bags under my eyes and I'd sleep a lot more. Believe me, if I could, I would trade places with you. No doubt. Did you see this? Amazing! "Entrepreneur of the Year". -Congrats, Dad. You look hot. -Thank you. It's about time, huh? What do you mean? Do you believe in destiny, that everything is already determined? People say we are the architects of our own destiny. How so? Well, sometimes we think we have everything under control, but we don't always have a grasp on the situation. My advice is, when you see things don't turn out the way you planned, let go of the wheel and see where life takes you. See how far you go. Will everything be predetermined or do you decide your destiny? I'm definitely a psychic. Dad, I swear. I dream about things. -Yeah? -Yeah. And what do you see in the dreams? Have you noticed that I'm 17 and I've never had a boyfriend? Yes, of course. And thanks. Why? Who are you interested in? Dad, it's super late. Have a nice day! Eat your breakfast! Come back here! It's the most important meal of the day! And Renata? She left. OK, see you soon. Bye. Hi, nené! Jenny asked if we could pick her up at her house. Only if she's waiting outside already. WAIT OUTSIDE! -WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE. -GIVE ME A RIDE? -COME PICK ME UP. -DON'T FORGET ME. -Renata... -Hi, Tomy. Hi. So... did you do the homework? Homework? Silly! It's the last day of school. There is no homework. Want some coffee? -You're an idiot, man. -I know, tell me about it. Stupid, idiot dumbass. I'm one of those people who are considered to be amongst the most popular in school. I'm the classic cool chick who must go to your party so that everybody can say their party was awesome. And if I decide not to go, obviously, no one would go. In other words, your party would end up being a total failure. And that would suck. You must be thinking I'm making this up. But I swear, I'm not. Of course, there are people who admire me and others who hate me. At a glance, you would think I have everything and that my parents spoil me and I am super pampered. But that's not the case. I'm alone. But in the past few months, life has taught me a huge lesson about humility. It's amazing how life puts you in your place when you least expect it. Let's see. Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. If you have time, I'll tell you the whole story, OK? I don't think I'm ugly. Sorry, but to tell the whole story, I should be as sincere as possible. So, frankly, I think I'm actually very pretty. In fact, since I was born, I was a typical commercial baby. -Oh, what a cute baby! -Beautiful. -She looks like an angel. -What a cute baby. This year, I'll be of legal age, but my parents are stuck in the 80's. And, well, it's been tough. I have a ton of fans, more than I can count. I'm 17 and I never had a boyfriend and I can't help it, everyone likes me except the person I like, my adorable tormentor. And there he is! The love of my life appeared before I even knew it. Leonardo literally saw me come into this world. You can say I started loving him before I could put it into words. Since he was a boy, Leo was my half-brother's best friend. People say we are half-siblings, but he says we are a half more than siblings. And I don't understand. He's kind of weird, but I adore him. You could say they were born together. Our dads have been friends since elementary school, and it was a blessing and a tragedy at the same time. We were separated for many years by the Atlantic for many seasons, and no one missed him more than me. I swear I thought about becoming a Spanish citizen. But, well, they say age is not an obstacle for love. So, I decided this is the perfect moment to make him fall for me. News flash. A tragedy has just occurred. -You don't know what happened. -What? I just heard Leonardo has a girlfriend. -Someone called Susana Montero. -Susana Montero? I know her. I can just imagine what she looks like. Must be the typical fake blonde who looked for López Infante to get total facial plastic surgery. No. She actually won a beauty contest a long time ago. So, she must be an airhead. Actually, mom told me she came back from Europe after getting a PhD in Political Science. So, she's a gold digger and hangs out with Leo because of his money. I don't think so. Her dad is one of the most important entrepreneurs in Monterrey. He works in real estate in the US and Mexico. Really? Typical daddy's girl who must think she's the bomb. No, I know her. She's super nice. Valeria, this can't be happening. -She must have leprosy. -Leprosy? Yes! There must be something wrong with the bitch. I don't know! I hope her implant pops! I don't think so. She's super healthy. Actually, I follow her lifestyle blog. Valeria, shut up, OK? Don't you realize we're talking about the perfect woman? Sorry. Yes. The enemy seemed to be a worthy adversary. But if she's pretty, I'm even more beautiful. If she's smart... Please, I'll be even more. Besides, I'm younger. Don't all guys like younger women? Susanita, you have no idea who you're messing with. Nobody beats Renata. -What's going on? -I need to get ready. I need to plan the perfect strategy for this situation, nené. Maybe... I'll have plastic surgery. No. Natural is better. I need to be super pretty, more than I already am. That's all. Yeah, but why? Are you meeting her today? Of course not. But he will introduce me to her soon. Leonardo is like that. I need to change. I'm changing today. Just like the song goes. But I'm not packing my bags. Just changing, you know? He has to notice the woman that has been there for him all this time. He just didn't see it, you know? Me, incredible, but in a better version. Today you will start calling me "Regina George". -Seriously? -Yes. Now you've gone too far. Yeah, a little. Maybe not so Mean Girl. You have to help me transform. Yes. What time is it? Six-thirty. Six-thirty! Turn on the TV. Let's see. How are you? Good afternoon. I'm glad you're with us. We have a lot of news for you. But let's start with the headlines. Isn't he the most handsome and delicate man you've ever seen? I know. Hey, but he's mine. Don't even think about it. Don't make plans, don't be intense. I just need one week. Ren, can you... Nené, I'm watching the news. Don't you know how important current events are? Like... The conflicts in the Middle East continue. Here's Araceli Mendoza, our special correspondent. -I don't care. What'd you say? -Forget it. Leo. -Let's see, Leo. -What's the matter? Right after this story, we'll move on to the factory fire. -Yes. OK. -Gabriel is ready. Then we'll go for some beers, yeah? Kidding. After that, we're doing an exclusive with Jackie. Yes. Is that a new cologne? It reminds me of my mom. And that's my brother. The weird one I was talking about. He's the producer. I told you, they're inseparable. I don't know how. Sometimes, I get a bizarre image in my head that Mom nursed both of them. Gross! I've been watching him for a long time, so I know what he likes. Well, sort of, because he's actually head over heels. But he has a heart of gold. And it's time for his little heart to be mine. How do I know? Have I mentioned I'm psychic? One day, I started dreaming and realized the time had come. Do you believe in signs? I actually did not understand it in the beginning. -Hi, princess. -Leo, how are you? What a surprise. One, I knew he'd be here. Every Tuesday my brother and Leo come here to eat together. And two, I knew my brother would be late. Mom told me something unexpected came up and he could have let him know. Of course, had I not accidentally taken his phone. Hey, what are you doing here? Waiting for some friends. -They're not here yet. -Same with your brother. -Really? -Let's wait together? -Sure. -Please. What did you do with your hair? I dyed it. Like it? Yeah, it's cool. I think I saw it already. Of course, you did, silly. It's the same color the skinny chick you were with had. As if that would ever happen to me! -Maybe you saw it on TV. -Yeah. It looks good. Thanks. You won't believe it, but your blouse... I think I've seen it before on someone. Of course you have. The corn-haired girl you used to go out with had one. Your hair is beautiful. Who knows? But I don't think so because it's new. I don't think anyone has it. Maybe. And how's school? Good. It's my last semester, and we're going on vacation. Your brother told me he's going as the nanny. -He said that? -Yeah. Wiseass. He asked me to go with him. You're going to Puerto Vallarta, right? You'd better go. It's crucial for my plan. -So he invited you! -Yes. Amazing! We'll have fun, you'll see. Of course. By the way, that's why we were meeting here. But he hasn't shown up. Yeah, he's always late. He gets super distracted. I want to tell you something. -Seriously? -Yes. Anything. I'm all ears. -It's just... Finally! -Leo! I couldn't call. I don't know where my phone is. Oh, brother, sorry. I got it by accident this morning. I messed up. I was late and grabbed it by accident. -How come? Our phones aren't alike. -Yeah. Is that a problem? Of course they are. Why are you being so rude? -It's just... -Hey! Back off. Forget it, come on. You're here now. -All right. -Terrible, huh? Wow. I'm leaving. No, wait. Your friends should be here soon. What friends? Weren't you meeting some friends? Oh, stupid me. Think fast. Yes! Friends. But I don't like them very much. Plus, they're super late and I'm not waiting anymore. Bye, princess. "Princess". Oh, I love that. We're going to be there in a few days. Yes. Is Leonardo going? Of course. Everything is going as planned. Don't you think he's too old for you? No. I mean, we'll see. Medicine today is super advanced. We are going to live much longer. When I'm 100, he'll be 112. No one will be able to tell. With wrinkles, yes, but... -Well, if you put it that way. -Plus, the other day, I swear we connected in a very cool way. He was about to tell me something very important, but my stupid brother showed up. -Really? -Yeah. He ruined the moment. Hey, you know what? Leonardo reminds me of my ex, Victor Hugo. But listen, Valeria... Leonardo... Victor Hugo. -A short fat guy! -Not true. He wasn't fat! Yes, he was. It was 250 pounds of fish and bait. -No, it wasn't. -Yes, it was. Let's see. He was a little overweight, that's all. A little? You're a toothpick compared to him. Well, he was really nice, to be honest. -I miss my fatso. -Can you stop talking about your fatso? I swear, all I can think about is how much he ate. No! Besides, remember we must be super well for Puerto Vallarta. Puerto Vallarta. The beach, Leonardo and me. He's going to say he loves me. Oh, I got goosebumps! I'm telling you, it's going to happen. Like, at six in the afternoon. Our hair will blow in the wind, because we both have long hair. -Yes. -The hair will work. Like this, right? Then, he'll look into my eyes, hold my hands, like Titanic, and will say, "I can't hide it any longer. I'm deeply in love with you. Kiss me." -Where did you get that from? -From the eight o'clock soap. Something like that will happen. I can feel it. -You think? -Yes. -And what about Susana? -What Susana? Look, Valeria, that chick won't last three seconds. I guarantee it. When she sees me super pretty, dressed up and divine, she'll say, "How can I compete with her? I'd better leave and look for my mouse." You know? Remember, gentlemen prefer beauties. No, it's not like that. It's "gentlemen prefer blondes". I know! But this is my version. -So learn it. -All right. Let's see. All I'm sure of is that we're going to have a hell of a time in Puerto Vallarta. -I know. It'll be amazing. -Guess who else is going. -Who? -Luis and Tomás. -Really? -Yes. That's great! Renata! -I'll be right back. -OK. I'll see you in a bit. -Renata? Honey? -What's up, Mom? Look. I'm putting a note here so I can buy your tickets tomorrow. -I want a window seat, OK? -Honey. Remind your brother to confirm it with work, all right? -You can't go alone. -I know. I'm going to miss you so much! And we'll miss you. But I have a question. Yes. -Do you believe in destiny? -I'm not sure what you mean. When you met Dad, did you know you'd marry him? Ah, those destiny things. -You're not getting married, right? -No, Mom. Of course not. Are you finally going to date someone? How can I explain it? When the right man shows up, something inside will tell you. -Really? -Yes. So it's true. -It's true, thank God. -Who's the lucky guy? Tell me! -Mom, you're going to be late. -Who cares? You come first. It's nobody. Really. I'll tell you later. -I was just curious. -All right. You would tell me, right? -I tell you everything, you know that. -Honey! I love you. Love you more, Mom. I'm not worried about my mom, but my dad... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven! Oh, God, no! -What? -Nothing. Look, I think... Like Leonardo, for example. What? He's always falling in love with someone different. Then, he met Susana and has been dating her for a while. Now, he's getting married. -Married? -Yes. How? Who's Susana? Married for real? A wedding with a priest and everything? No, I know. A fake marriage! No, honey. Married as in nuptials. No, Mom! Leonardo can't get married. Not yet! I don't have a dress. I was also surprised, but that's how it is. No, Mom! This can't be happening. -Aren't you happy for him, honey? -Yeah, you don't know how much. Maybe you think you can find everything out on social media. But no! Mom told them, "Stay there, I'm coming." Well, over with eventual heart attack. Let's continue. My theory about men. They're all like fish. Yeah. They have a small brain, like this. Sorry, but it's true. Leonardo confirmed this. The only thing I must do is throw the line and reel it in to catch him. Make a perfect plan and, of course, I must go somewhere to find some good inspiration. I bet if Da Vinci was resurrected and lived now, the first thing the media would ask would be, "Is it true you were gay?" I'm looking for inspiration. I have great plans. I would send a text from an unknown number. Words that, separately, would form a phrase, with the intent to stir his imagination, obviously. First, I based everything on the movie American Beauty. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU IN BED WITH ROSES Me and my movie obsession! The words would form the phrase: "I'll wait for you in bed with roses." No! Super slutty. Just to catch his attention. Something happened. The order of the words came undone, and he got something like "I hope you get chaffed in bed." Seriously! What the hell? What's up with you? Why would there be something wrong? Rich girl alone at the museum. Of course there's something wrong. Who do you think you are? Brat, you don't even know me. I'm Chantal. -I'm Renata. -So what happened to you? A tragedy. My boyfriend is marrying another girl. -Is he a Mormon or something? -What? If you're his girlfriend and he's marrying another girl, he has a lot of women, right? No. He's not a Mormon. I mean... -So he's not your boyfriend. -Yes, he is. But he doesn't know it yet. You want him to be your boyfriend, but you haven't told him? Something like that. -And what about the wedding? -Please, don't say that. -When do they get married? -That, too. Please. All right. -When's the party? -Please! Can't you understand? I don't want to talk about it. Can't you see? I'm depressed. I'm in mourning. I'd dress up like you, but it's ugly. I just came here to be depressed. Denial will not help you at all. That's creepy. Really, you scare me. You're like a dark therapist, or Walter Mercado who has his own psychic hotline. I just call it as I see it. I didn't call your toll-free number and ask for an opinion. Spare me your comments. You're prettier when you're quiet. All right, I didn't say anything. All right. It's been years. The guy's a pedophile? No. I'm the one who's been chasing him. Since I was born, to be exact. I just don't know. I don't know what to do to make him notice me. What you need is... make the guy know you want him to pop your cherry. What? I mean, are you crazy or what's wrong with you? No, just when we get married. -The music, lights, wine... -From what you're saying, this guy's a pervert. -Why? You know him? -No. If he's not noticed after all this time... Why don't you tell him that? -To his face. -What face? Tell him what's happening. Because the smartass had the bright idea of getting a girlfriend and getting engaged. No. Voilà. You need other means. Well, and you? What are you doing here? I doubt you came to see the art. I'm ditching school. I mean, you skipped school and came to the museum. God! -Stupid, right? -With all due respect, yeah. And? What are you going to do? I came here for inspiration. We're going on vacation. -How open-minded. -Not just him and I. I wish it were. I'd be great, but no. Some friends, my brother, and him. -Is his fiancée going? -Of course not. That chick supposedly has a lifestyle blog and has a million things to do. There you go. You did it. You're the best. It's more artistic, there's not too much of a budget. No, but I like it anyway. We're in different seats? I think so. My seat is closer to the front. -Hey, we're going to sit together. -What a coincidence, huh? I'm going to tell you something. -I am scared of flying. -No. Yes, I get super nervous. What if it crashes? You'd hold me, right? I mean, you know. If you jump, I jump. Rose, Leo. I jump, Rose. Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen. Everything has been written. When your time comes, it comes. So you believe everything is predetermined? -Of course. -But let's say... What if it's time for the little monkey in front of us to die, not my time? I don't want to die. He might, but... I wasn't talking about you. I meant the monkey down further. Don't be nosy. -Why "little monkey?" -Yes! It's a little monkey. -Hi. -How are you? You are Leonardo, right? From the news? Yes. Nice to meet you. I travel a lot, but when I'm on the ground, I never miss your newscast. I love it. -I mean, I love your broadcast. -Thank you. -You want something to drink? -No, thanks. We're good. You know, the other day I was looking at you... Oh, thanks. That's amazing! You're super pretty, your pashmina is divine. My friends are all hungover and need some water. Can you give them some? They're not on TV or anything, but... -Sure. -Great. Bye. What a slut. She wanted to hang all over you. Don't exaggerate. She was pretty and beautiful. Pretty and beautiful. You don't know the difference between pretty, beautiful, cool, hot, or any of those weird beauty terms? What's wrong with you? One might say you're jealous. Me, jealous? No way. Why? Hey, I need to talk to you. -Yeah, me, too. You have no idea. -Really? -I'm all ears. Speak. -What's the matter? Change seats with Tomás. What? -We can talk about the series... -Yes, perfect. -Lucky you. -Right? -Tomás. -Come on. Please, take your seats and fasten your seatbelts. I was so annoyed. Everything was perfect. I know. I thought everything would work out, until I saw your brother take Leonardo's seat so Tomás could sit there. Yeah, what an idiot. He always ruins everything. -Now, Tomy is super intense. -Yeah? Yeah, he must have a girlfriend or something, because he wanted to tell me something. -No, I don't think so. -Yes. He's here. Go to the room, OK? -I don't even know what room. -It doesn't matter. Just find out. -Hey you! -Guess who's coming? -Who? -Susana, my girlfriend. -Your girlfriend? -She's coming here. -Yeah? -You'll get to meet her. You'll love Susana. You guys will get along great. -Sure! -Yes. -That's great news. -Yeah. How are these people so skinny? It's so ugly. You can see all the bones. They look anorexic. I don't like it. It's ugly. Coming! I'm coming! -Finally! -What happened? I forgot the room number and was wandering in the hotel. And everyone was giving me their plates. What's wrong with them? As if I was from room service. This looks great. You're eating someone else's food. You don't think that's gross? -No. -Well, that's not the issue. The issue is, I just found out that Susana is coming here. -What? -Yes. The jerk just told me: "We're having dinner tonight! I'll introduce her to you." Cool! Great. -You're making fun of me. -No. Can't you see she's my competition? -I'm sorry. -She's doesn't even compare to me. But I have to be amazing, beautiful, like I've never been! Like a Kardashian. Yeah. Shoes, lips, boobs... Hair. Sure, I have to be divine. -Yes. -You know? Obviously. I wouldn't let him go on vacation by himself, with a woman like me. I'd be scared. -Yeah. -In fact, I feel sorry for the girl. I mean, poor thing. At least... I don't know, maybe buy her a business class ticket back. Right? Charity work. Susanita Foundation. You look beautiful. Yeah, I know. -Am I going with you? -Yeah, but get there a little later. I want us to be alone on our first date. Without my rival, you know? I want Leo to see and melt. -I can see it. -Me, too, my friend. I can see it already. I'm a size four in rings. I'll let Leo know. Leo, you're going to see everything you've been missing out on. Never in my life have I seen a woman so beautiful. What was I thinking? How can I compete with a Greek sculpture made of flesh and bone? -Princess. -Hello. How are you? Susana, my girlfriend. -Hi. -How are you? Good, thanks. You're so pretty. Leo told me so much about you. But not everything. He forgot to mention how pretty you are. Great. Thanks, likewise. Princess! Are you OK? Yeah, I have a headache. Well, we have dinner reservations. Your brother should be here soon. -And Valeria. -We'll be waiting. Sure. Puerto Vallarta is so pretty. I love it. It's not fair. I saw him first. I loved him before you. I love him more. -Cheers to that. -Cheers. Have you ever felt that pain? It's very sharp, upsets your stomach, as if you were to throw up. Princess... are you not feeling well? -Yeah, I don't feel good. -Should we call a doctor? No, thanks. If you'll excuse me... Princess... I've heard love hurts, but I never knew it hurt so much. Without a doubt, it's for me. Heavy. Valeria! What are you doing? That guy is cute. He looks like the guy from Twilight. Taylor Lautner? He looks more like Jonah Hill. -Of course not. He's hot. -You're terrible. He's ugly. Thanks. How pretty! -This is Susana. Of course it is. -Liar. It has your nose. -And your eyebrows. -It has your nose. Girls! -Hi, how are you? -I'll put it here for you. We were going scuba diving. Do you want to come with us? I'm scared of it, can you believe it? -What if we go kayaking? -All right. I don't want to get sunburned. My back gets really red. Well, then we can ride horses. -I'm allergic, can you believe it? -That's too bad. What if we go to the club? Yes, of course. Let's go. It's amazing. But they aren't going to let us... -Yes, we can go. -Why'd you pinch me? Don't be afraid, calm down. It's just that I've never gone. But we can go. -Let's say eight p.m.? -We're not going out... We can go at eight p.m., OK? We'll be ready at eight. -Stop pinching me. -Are you mad or what? Bye. -They're funny. -Yeah. Girls? Are you sure you're old enough to get in? -Yes. -Yes. -We're 18, since last year. -I thought you were still 17. No, silly. I invited you to my party, don't you remember? -Yeah, but I forgot. -Well... Time flies, doesn't it? -Let's go? -Sure. Good evening. -Have fun. -Thanks. Your ID, please? How cute. You know I am of age. You're great, handsome. I like you very much. You're a cool guy, right? Are you Enriqueta Méndez? Yeah, my mom and her crazy names. Mine... Thirty years old? I don't look it, right? I know, I'm divine. You know I'm BFFs with Amy Myers. She suggested some creams that stretch my face. I can't even smile anymore. Look. You know, Botox, sir. But I should try. Sure, step aside, please. Renata, is everything OK? Yeah, go ahead. Order us some drinks or something, OK? What would you like? -Gin tonic. -OK. Bye. I'll see you soon. -Pity. -Shut up! -All that makeup for nothing. -Shut up. What happened last night, girls? -Last night? What do you mean? -We waited for you guys. -They didn't let us... -Weren't you getting some drinks? We were both thirsty. I want a piña colada, please. He likes mojitos. Yeah, but I don't want one. Thanks. Anything's fine. Thanks, my friend. -No hurry. -Hi. Thanks, Val. You were saying, yesterday... She had a migraine last night and felt very sick. I brought her to the hotel, like a good friend, of course. Now she's fine and wants to drink! -Yeah. -She's weird like that. Nowadays, girls recover quite fast. -Why aren't you with your boyfriend? -My boyfriend? Who? Let me be crystal clear, I have no boyfriend. I'm single. All the Single Ladies. You know? I could've sworn Tomás was your boyfriend. Tomasito? Really? That's a great joke. No way. You, Tomás... No way. Of course not. The truth is, they're gay. Really? Cutie, forgive me. I'm going straight to hell. I couldn't think of anything! Besides, I couldn't let Leo think for one second that I'm not available to him. That's OK, right? You didn't know? You hadn't noticed? -Now that you mention it... -Of course. Thing is, -they're not very obvious about it. -Who knew, right? They've been together a long time and they're super cute. I think they love you very much. I love them, and they love me. Of course, I played cupid. -Yeah? -Yeah. -No way. -Love you, guys! -Tell me who she was! -Who? I see you talk to her every night, always the same girl. Not again. You're jealous as always. -It's always the same! -No, you're wrong. No, I'm not. You text her every night. -My phone was dead. -Was not! I saw you texting her right in front of me. Hey, what's the matter? She's crazy. Oh, this can only be another sign. Incredible. -You are delicious. -Nené! Nené, I got it. I'm a genius. Look, Ren. He's hot. Who? The butcher? That's not cool. Let's see what you're going to say. I have the perfect plan to get rid of Susana. You're not thinking of... Don't be silly! Of course not. I'm too young to go jail. And I don't look good in orange. You scared me. I'm going to make Leo and Susana break up. -How? -By making them argue, of course. Every couple argues and ends up working things out. No, this will be a super serious argument. It's going to be so bad. It'll be like the soap operas, you know? They'll hate each other and never want to see each other again. That's it. I was walking on the beach and I saw a couple arguing near a hot dog stand. -She was super... -Wait! They sell hot dogs at the beach? You're seriously thinking about food while I'm telling you something super important? OK, sorry. Pay attention! All right? Here's the plan. They fight so bad they will not reconcile. -It won't be possible. -How can that happen? With another guy, of course. Don't tell me Susana is going out with another guy! Yes, she is. I know, it's super sad. I told you she was evil. You believed it, right? I'm such a good actress. So, that's what Leo has to believe, understand? -And how? -Listen. The first thing is making you super-hot. -Me? Why? It should be you. -What do you mean, "why you"? Get a grip. I can't just casually pop out. No one can know I am part of this plan. Nor that it's my plan. So, you must look super-hot. Like a femme fatale, delicious, beautiful, super sexy. What do they say? Like a man-eater. I want to be a man-eater. Perfect, nené! I love it! Look, I also have this. Too much. No. It's terrible. Don't choke. Throw it away. Oh, gosh. No, let's drop the cigarette. Now I don't know. The dress is not very convincing. Why? I don't know, the cleavage. You need to be more... Sexy? No, something else. -Flirty? -No. -You need to look sluttier. -Sluttier? -Yes! I want to be sluttier! -Bravo! You're going to ask for an exotic drink. I want what James Bond drinks. A dry martini, please. No, this is awful. OK, I know! Something like people drink on a cruise. -A Miami Vice. -Miami Vice? -Yeah, it's delish. One Miami Vice. -No, that drink scares me. Really? So, something stronger, guaranteed. A shot,Fireball. No, that's too intense, you know? A piña colada, please. OK, you're right. Something lighter, cooler. A piña colada. I like. -I can't drink this. -Why? Because I have no ID. So? Wouldn't it be better in another place? No. Right here is fine. Please, don't do this. It looks like you're holding the building. It's kind of weird. There, divine! Look up. Oh, I love your outfit. It's divine. I love it. Now, we just need to find a little monkey. Someone who passes by casually. Hi, gorgeous. No, gross, not my brother. It's too weird. No and no! Then who? It's has to be a stranger. Someone, I don't know... awesome. -You! Come here. Hi. -Wow, you have great taste. He's a bit too skinny but he'll do. Seriously? The thing is, this guy here must be convinced to go to your room. -My room? -Yes, your room. -For what? -What do you mean? Not your room, Susanita's room. Remember the plan. And don't get too excited. No one loves you. We're just using you for the plan. Don't even think about it. You confuse me. I don't know what I'm going to do. All you must do is make this guy understand and make him believe he has to go to your room and you'll wait for him there, but no. He's actually going to Susanita's room. What are you doing? It's that way. What do you think? You're so mean. And that's not all. "I'm waiting for you in my room right now. Susana." MINUTES LATER WHY? OH, WHY? I'M NOT CHEATING... YOU'RE A CHEATER NO, I'M NOT SHE LIED! HOPE YOUR LOVER MAKES YOU HAPPY PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE! #Don'tBeAnAsshole -The plan is great! -I know! -It's so creative. -I know, nené. You think it's going to work? Sure. Why wouldn't it? Don't jinx it. I don't know. What if the guy sees it's a scam? Damn! Not that. That's why so many people don't have a clue of what goes on in their life. Chapo, for example. He never knew it was just about a movie, until Kate talked on TV. -Yeah? -Yeah. Everything will work out. I'm absolutely sure. All's fair in love and war. Yeah, right? How beautiful. Ren, don't you think Leonardo is too skinny? He looks undernourished, right? That's gross! No! -Handsome. -I think he's anorexic. Nené! Nené, what happened? Where were you? Around. The plan was perfect. Some would say it's a work of art. Maybe I exaggerated a bit. Yeah, I deserve a prize, or something of the sort. Besides, it's not so hard. It's amazing how everyone believes what you say. I'm a genius. -Hi, nice to meet you! -Hi, nice to meet you! -How are you? -Good, you? What's your name? -Tomás. And yours? -Valeria! -How old are you? -Seventeen. When I introduced them, I said the other one was a deaf. They had to shout to be heard. But that's another story. Let's go back to Leonardo. The plan was perfectly defined. Everything was going as planned, and the result... -Good morning. -Hi, princess. Hi! -How are you? -Good. That's life, right? Renata, I thought she was... the one, you know? I'm not sure if I'm clear. Something inside me was telling me... she was the one. Our minds play tricks on us sometimes. It makes you realize there are more beautiful things out there. That's it. -That's it. -You're going to be OK. I hope so. You still have a week of vacation. We can swim with dolphins, go kayaking... Thanks, princess. -But I changed my flight. -What? Why? Sorry, princess. I'm not in a good mood. But... Hey, what happened with Leonardo? He's depressed because he broke up with Susana. No, not that. He just gave me some tickets to see some male strippers. Why? Who knows? He's depressed. Leave him alone. Don't pay attention. Nené, I have a hangover. -But you didn't drink. -Yes. Oh, no. A moral hangover. I don't know. My heart is aching. It's because you're a bitch. Excuse me? -Did I say that or think it? -You said it, missy. Why are you saying that? Sorry, but it's true. You went too far. If people say, "You're great, cute, a good person..." You're not. I'm super nice and I did it for love, OK? And for the good of both of us. I helped destiny. Gave it a little push to speed things up. -Anyway, they were breaking up. -What if they weren't? What do you mean? -What if you're wrong? -I'm never wrong. I saw it in a dream. I told you a million times. -I'm psychic. -Right. If you say so. What if Leonardo goes back to Querétaro, after Susana, and they make up? As if I didn't know him. Leo would never do that. He would never beg a woman to come back. The only woman he'll ever beg is me. What if he finds out everything? How? How would he? This place is too pretty for you to be so negative. I know, but don't you think everything went too perfectly? -That was the goal. -Yes, I know. If everything is predestined, as you say, why should we have done what we did? I'm glad you're with us. We have a lot of news for you. Before we begin, let's see the headlines. It looks like it's been taken from a film noir movie. It's a victory with a taste of defeat. How can I be happy if I see him so sad? Don't miss our broadcast tomorrow, same time, same channel. Have an excellent night. You don't know him. That's why you can't see. But I know he's unhappy. I swear I thought he'd get over it sooner. What did you do, Renata? Seriously, what? HOW ARE YOU? WELL, PRINCESS. DON'T WORRY. Oh, Leo, you're a sweetheart. You went too far this time, Renata. There's no excuse. -What did you do? How do you feel? -Well, you can imagine. -Renata, come here right now! -Oh, no! Renata, come down now! I don't like the tone of her voice. Why don't you come with me? -You think she found out? -No way. Shut up! -Come on. -Renata! -Renata, come here! -What happened, Mom? -Do you know where I went? -No. To Susana's mom's house. -She a precious lady... -Shut up! I'm talking. You know what she told me? That something very unpleasant happened during vacation. And, of course, her daughter had nothing to do with it. Someone orchestrated and planned Leonardo and Susana's breakup. Do you know anything about it? -No. -Don't lie to me. No! That's so sad. They were a great couple. -I like them... -You think you can fool me? Tell me what happened. All right. I was being cornered. It was time to confess. Moral of the story, always tell the truth. It was all Valeria's fault. -What? -What? -Yes, because she's pregnant. -What? I swear I told Tomás to be careful, but you know these things. He loves going to parties without condoms. Nené! Nené, wake up! -What happened? -You scared me. Are you OK? -Where am I? -In my room. Everything's OK. This time you really crossed the line! Why'd you say those absurdities? Please, forgive me. I couldn't think of anything else to say. You know I'm super creative. Very good, by the way. That's why we're friends, remember? Why don't we do something? Let's go to Disneyland, just you and me. We'll sing "Let It Go" whenever you want. I'll dress you up like a princess. We can ride Space Mountain. -It'll be amazing. -I can't. -Why? -Pregnant women can't go on the rides. Please! Don't do this. Well, I was going to tell Leo everything, explain what happened, and... And don't worry about your parents. They're traveling. I'll fix everything before they come back. No one will know. -Give me a few days, please. -Promise? Pinky promise. Just remember you love me. Sorry, as I was saying... The bad thing about a lie is it has no legs. And I have short memory. Hi! Val's mom had a huge surprise coming. So, what's new? -Are you OK? -Why? -Your problem. -What problem? -Your daughter's. -What's wrong with my daughter? -She's pregnant. -My daughter is pregnant? Obviously, it didn't go over well with her mom, and with her dad it was even worse. I'm glad he didn't catch him. -Hi, princess. -Hi! How are you? Your brother's not here yet? He's not coming. He bailed on us? No. Actually, I said that because I wanted to have lunch with you. And why wouldn't I come to lunch with such a beautiful girl, tell me? Leo,please, don't make this even harder. I need to confess something and... -I'm super nervous. -Princess, what's wrong? -Leo, you know I love you. -Of course. I love you, too. You don't understand. I... I love you in a different way. A lot. As a woman. I'm in love with you. Since forever, all my life. That's why I hate seeing you with someone, I get very jealous. I'm super jealous. -Princess, what do you mean? -I needed to tell you that and I just did. I thought there'd come a time when we would have our "and they lived happily ever after." But Susana showed up. Things got complicated. -Princess, I'm honored, really. -You didn't know? You didn't notice? No, I didn't. -How? -Well, now you know. And now that you know... I want to ask for a chance. -A chance? -Yes. And when you decide, we can talk to my parents, so you can ask their permission to be with me. Princess, that's not possible. What? -Renata, would you date your brother? -Of course not. And I can't date my sister. But I'm not your sister, Leo. Yes, I know, but it's as if you were. I'm much older than you. You're just 17. And it's illegal. That's why you can ask permission. You can talk to my parents. My mom wouldn't see a problem. She's super open and would love it. Renata, I can't see you like that. We have a big age difference and there are many other reasons... Leo, can't you see everything I did for you? I cut my hair the way you like it! I speak the way you like. I dress the way you like. Just so you'll notice me. Renata, I always look at you. Seriously. You don't notice? You told me on the plane, on our way to Puerto Vallarta. You said you thought everything is predestined. -Yes. -I dreamed of it. I swear. Even Susana. That, too. I did it because I love you. Sorry, I think that's something I didn't tell you. What? -I made Susana break up with you. -What did you do? I did it for you and for me! That's what matters. Renata, what did you do? I did... what I had to do, Leonardo. I was not going to let that woman go to your house, feel at home, stay with you, when... When I waited for that my whole life. For the last time, what did you do, Renata? -OK, I split you guys up. -OK. -My opinion didn't matter? -Of course it did. But I'd have done the same, if you loved me... as much as I love you. Maybe... I swear, in time, things will fall in place. -I'll be a great girlfriend. -Renata, I love you, but just like my sister. Please, don't say that again. Renata, please, tell me exactly what happened. Please. All right. We went to Puerto Vallarta, and she wasn't going. But you invited her. And I... had the perfect plan. All I did was to make you see she's not the woman for you. She's not me! That woman deserves you just as much as I do, OK? So... What a lame excuse. The worst I've ever heard! Don't yell at me! Why not? What does this mean? We were getting married! What does this mean? I planned everything. Valeria helped me, of course, so you... would think she was cheating on you. She's one of those women. Of course, she's not for you. -OK. -Leo,please. I did it for love, Leo! Please, don't go! -You don't see all I do for you. -Renata, I don't know who you are. Just a minute! I'm coming! -Sorry, Susana. -What did you do now? I doubted you. But I never believed you would cheat on me. And how do you know it wasn't me? Renata just confessed. She planned everything. It's the same thing. You doubted me before, so... -Susana, let me in, please. -No. -We need to talk. -No. -Susana... -It's not necessary. Yes, it is! How could I know it was a plan to break us up? You chose to believe what was easier to believe. I can't be with someone who does not trust me. So, please... don't come back. Susana, please. -Let's talk, please. -No. Susana... Susana... What? -Have you come to make fun of me or what? -Of course not. It was terrible. Yes. I don't deserve to be forgiven, Oscar. You fell in love, that's all. But if you'd only seen. Leo, Leo! What am I going to do? Let's see. You can start by apologizing. No, I don't think I can. -I can't. No... -Then don't. Yes. I definitely don't want him in my life anymore. Don't see him anymore. Period. How can I do that? You guys are always together. I won't see him anymore, so it won't be a problem for you. But you're great friends. Yes, but you're my sister. You work together, Oscar. -I'll find another job. -Are you kidding me, silly? Of course not. You really love me, right? -Can't you tell? -No, actually. Talk to him. No. I don't want to see him. It'll be OK. I almost got robbed the other day. -Really? -Yeah, can you believe it? It was weird. The robber was very well-dressed. -Help! -Come here! What bad luck, Tomy. That's terrible. The crime rate here is awful. But you know they never get caught. And everyone likes to pretend they're robbers. Older people are the worst. Don't worry. -Right? -Yeah. -How'd you know? -I just thought about it. -Can we wait a little bit? -Sure. -I want to talk to you. -Sure, whatever you want. -Can we sit? -Yes. -You want something? -No, thanks, I'm good. -Well... -What's wrong? How many years have we been friends? A lot. I lost count. What I'm trying to say is... I'd like for us not to be friends anymore. What? Why, Tomy?Did I do something? If I did something wrong, please, forgive me. I swear, "silly" is just a pet name. Why are you saying this? You misunderstood, OK? I don't want us to be friends. I want us to be something more. What do you say? Really? I love Tomás, and my heart breaks seeing him so sad. I swear I'm not nosy, but his parents are divorced, hate each other, and have brutal fights over the kids. -I don't want them. Period! -I said no! You take them! Tomy, I had no idea, I swear. But I... I hate seeing you like this. I hate seeing you like this. The only thing I can do now is thank you, you know? You opened my eyes. I swear I'd love to correspond the way you deserve and I know you feel terrible. I've been through something similar. Wouldn't it be worse if I told "yes," but I didn't feel the same? Yeah, but why don't we try? It can work out. Who knows? Just till you see me differently. How stupid, I didn't even notice. -What didn't you notice? -I ruined everything. It's fine. I'm not the first to get rejected. No, please. Don't say that. I'm not rejecting you. There's no reason to take this the wrong way. I love you. I have to go. -I'll take you. -No. -You sure? -Yes. Thanks. I know you. Why do you always show up out of nowhere, huh? You know you're throwing away your youth? Yeah, I noticed. So, what happened with the guy who was your boyfriend but didn't know? That's a great question, right? Oh, my friend, if I told you... Did you split him up from that "bloffer"? Blogger... it's healthy... That's not the point. The point is yes. I split them up, but in the worst way. -Cool. -No, it's not cool. Now Leo won't talk to me and doesn't want to see me anymore. He's not yours nor the devil's. Too bad. What? What the hell? You're creepy. If he isn't dating you or her, he wasn't meant to be with you. It was predestined. No, you don't understand, Chantal. He should be mine. I dreamt about it, I swear. -I don't lie about these things. -How weird. And what's the next step? Honestly, I don't know. I have no idea. If you really cared about the guy, you should make it up to him, no? How can I do that? -Give him his girlfriend back. -Sure, what a brilliant idea. As if I could carry Susana in my purse like a Polly Pocket and give her back to him. "Here's your girlfriend." No, don't be stupid. I saw a cool soap opera. If this guy's really meant to be with you, you should care if he's happy, right? People say the truth hurts, and it really does. You're right. Are you insinuating I should go talk to Susana? No, I can't do that. I can't even look her in the eye. Come on, go, but with your head held high. Go on. -Hi, Susana. -Hi. Sit down. -Thanks. -You want something to drink? No, thanks. I'm good. Well, no, I'm not. I need to talk to you. Please, you have to get back together with Leo. -No, I don't to have to do anything. -Please, Susana! I swear, he's very depressed. I've never seen him like this. -Please,you have to get back together. -He deserves it. Don't say that. OK, I agree, he exaggerates a bit and he acts kind of weird. But he's super handsome, nice. Besides, he has a huge heart. He loves you, I'm sure. He had nothing to do with it. I'm the one to blame. -What were you thinking? -I saw him first. I mean... I thought if he broke up with you, he'd love me. I met him first. I was wrong. I'm sorry. It kills me to see him like this. I can't stand it. Please, get back with him. Is he really sad? Yes. You don't know him. I mean, you do, but not as well as I do. Let me just say, I know what he's thinking before he says it. Every gesture, every move. I know what it is. I know if he wants chilaquiles after drinking a lot, and what type of chilaquiles and sauce, what color he likes to use on Mondays... and that he's not going to be happy if you're not with him. You should have thought about all that before everything you did. Well, I'm 17. That's my excuse, right? He's much older than you. And some things cannot be forgiven. Please, Susana!Please! Don't be mean. I'm not going to get on my knees, get my jeans dirty, -and beg. I'm not like that. -You know what? I don't hate you, despite all you did. Really? Why do you have to be so awesome? I can't believe I'm going to say this. I would rather you hate me than not get back with Leo. Renata, this has nothing to do with you. There's no going back. Please, Susana, there's a solution for everything! Even for a bad dye job, and don't lie to me. With all due respect. I wouldn't be here if he hadn't asked me to come. He knows you don't want to see him. No way, never. You really came because he asked? Yes. I know. I had to lie again. But you saw that there was no other way of convincing her. Very pretty and smart, but stubborn as hell, huh? -Really? -Obviously. I mean, he didn't say, "I want you to go to Susana's, I think she's amazing". I like you. He said something like, "If you split us up, you have to get us back together, princess." -He said that. -Yeah, those sound like his words. I'm hearing an angelic voice right now. Renata, things are not that easy. No. Yes, they are. Let's go to the TV station right now. -Now? -Yes, now. The broadcast starts in an hour. This can't be resolved so easily. Susana!Focus! Don't you see the handsome guy you have beside you? Any girl would love to be in your shoes because he loves you. Even me. Think about that. Please. And what about I want? Doesn't it matter? Of course it does. Look, if you tell me, "OK, I love him, we love each other. Amazing wedding, flowers, etc." Perfect. But if that's not true and you don't love him, I'll grab my things right now, leave, and you'll never hear from us again. -We'll disappear, poof,bye. -Of course I love him, or I would not have said I'd marry him. I hope the idiot follows my lead and doesn't ruin everything. I hope to have you all here tomorrow, same time, same channel. Thank you and take care. Bye. OK, we're off air. Wait. Let's film one more thing. Camera one. This is for the show promos. Leo. Hi! Yes, let's do it. Come on. Leonardo! I did exactly what you asked. Remember? Susana is here.Hello! Susana, if you give me another chance, I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy. -What I don't understand... -Enough already! Kiss, get married, love each other, whatnot. But if this doesn't work out, I'll be very depressed. -How are you? -All right. -I love you. -I love you more. Hey, come dance with us. No, thanks, Tomy. I'm fine. You sure? This is the song you like, right? Chantal! I love it. You look beautiful. I told you some color would look great on you. No, I have my boots on. They look great. Good job. Nené! Did you see him? Yes, I would've seen him from the moon. But he looks skinnier in that shirt. He captured my heart. You have no idea, I'm so in love. Cool, I'm very happy for you. But, please, don't eat chocolate. -No, I'm going to dance. -Yes. Love you! Are these for me? No, Leonardo gave them to me and told me to give them to Tomás. Weird, right? How is my princess? As you can see, I'm celebrating. And your dreams? I think they'll have to wait a bit longer, Dad. You still believe in them? They say hope is the last thing to die. Actually, they have failed me a lot lately. So what have you decided? Is everything predestined, or are we the architects of our destiny? I've decided and learned I'm going to let go of the wheel to see where life takes me. Don't you think? Sometimes, that's the best thing to do. I learned that from you. -I love you. -I love you back. -Hi, Mom. -Hi. Honey, this is our song. -Let's dance. -Go dance to your song. Like... Want to dance? Oh, how handsome. It would be ideal in another moment. -Thanks, but no. -Come on, just one song. I'm just very tired. You're really going to leave me hanging? With my outreached hand? Do some squats! One, two, three. Come on! Honey. One and two. Change. All right. Three, four. Five, six. Shake your arms before each move. Ready? Let's do the next song. Get up and dance. No. A little warm, Mom. What? -Straight. -Is the camera ready?
