I need a favor, dude. Get Gili out of the car, okay? Noa is here. Then go. What do you need me for? Go tell her to buy us beers. And then what? What's the deal? I'm not into this plan bro. You got some kind of a problem? No. -It looks like you do. You're dumping your shit on me. You want to be an asshole? Then be one. Why'd you even bring her? - I wanted to be nice. Yeah right. - Chill, nothing happened. I am chill, bro. Fine. Can you get us beers? I'm underage. But you're so hot... Noa. Okay, let's move. Where are we going? - I'll take you somewhere. Hello. -Hey. Can I have three beers please? - What kind? - 'Goldstar.' I don't have 'Goldstar.' There's 'Tuborg' in the fridge. 21. I've only got 20. - Then buy two. Please? I can't help you, sweetheart. Okay, I'll check if I have it in pennies. Leave it, take all of them. Say, you from around here? - Yeah. Where did you study? - At 'Yovel'. What's your name? - Gili. How is it that I don't know you? I wasn't at high-school much. Wanna fix that? - I have a boyfriend. But I'll remember you. - Bye, honey. (Calling Omri) (Omri:) Sorry Babe, had to go meet the guys. (Omri:) You know I dig you, right? How 'how? He's so ugly. Check her in. Who? Check out what's she's wearing. You're such a bad person. Hey, what's up? You know each other, yeah? Gorgeous blouse. - Yours too. Where from? My Dad got it in London. - Cool Dad. Yeah, with a good taste for fashion. He's a great shopper. My Dad hasn't spoken to me for two years. Actually, I didn't speak to him, But then he started... He's a dick. What. Am I bothering you? - No way. We were just drinking. I'll make you one. Vodka Red Bull? - I like it straight. Wow, 'Straight! Cheers. -Cheers. Wow. -Really impressive. What were you talking about? Naama and her chubby guy. - He's not my 'guy'! Admit it. You're so disgusting! So Gili, are you having fun? Better than 'Rishonim' (High)? - Yeah, by far. Why did you leave? - I was bored. The vibe here is cooler. There's a 'vibe' here? At 'Rishonim' it's either preppies, or geeks. And they make stuff up about you. What do you mean? If you don't dress like they do... and listen to their music and... then they call you, like, weird. - Jerks. Is that why you left? No, I don't care what those bored losers say. There are losers everywhere. Yeah, they say you slept with Omri Stein. Shut up, you airhead! Better they'll talk behind her back? I'm honest, Sorry... Did I offend you? Of course not. I don't believe it, don't worry. I'm just interested, who told you? Wow, I so don't remember. Sorry. One of the guys, maybe. Some dude called Shabat maybe? Who's Shabat? - Just some lame friend of Omri's. Why, what's he got with you? Nothing. He'd wish he had. So, he made up that you had a thing with Omri? What a loser. - I didn't say he made it up. How's that? Why are you so surprised? You hooked up with Omri? Did you have sex? What do you think we did? But he has a girlfriend - Yes, that Noa. Yeah, well, he broke up with her. But I heard they got back together. Umm... Not exactly. Never mind. - What? -Spill it! Nothing. She's in 9th grade, and... You know. It isn't... It's not like I'm really into him. It's more about sexual attraction, you know. But does Noa know about it? I don't know. Why would I care? I'm just asking... Don't you mind that he's so...? Like, using you? - Yeah, totally using you. It's more like I'm using him. Like... I did Tomer and him in the same week, so... Which Tomer? Rozenberg? Yeah. After Tome-r, I hooked up with Omri. Whoa. You got with both of them? Wow, fuck... -You rock. You see it isn't that hard. - shut up. Have you been with anyone else in our class? Uhm, no, not yet. Hey, stupid, come on already! You coming to the 'Night'? Yeah, it's Omri's party. I can get you in. What, for free? - Yeah, probably. How are you getting there? I don't know yet. Our car is packed, Mia has to hide. No I'm not! - You've got a ride, right?

You probably don't even listen to messages. Never mind. Bye. What? Get out, get out. -Uh-uh. What, 'uh-uh'? You've got a computer downstairs. So, move. Have a seat. Want something to drink? I'm not thirsty. - Are you sure? Is there juice? There's apple, you dig? - Yeah. -Cool. Here you are, my lady. - Thanks. You like this...? -I don't care. You want it off? -I don't care. Okay, so I'm leaving it on. - Leave it on. What? Nothing, it's nice the streak. Three dollars on E-Bay. Show me your nails. Don't. -What, I bite 'em too. Look. My feet too. You reach your mouth with your feet? I'm full of surprises. Does it give you shivers? Not really. -But it feels nice. Alright. You've got such small hands.

No, I don't know. Like... I didn't like the way he treated you. What, are you serious? -Yeah. We're totally fine. Like, what? Noa is there too, you know. I'm not in love with him, you know. He's a good lay, that's all. You want head? What? No, like... to bring the Head-massager... Don't care. Should I bring it or not? - Bring it, then. Okay. Lay on your belly. Who's that?

Everybody knows me. Stop, Shabat. -What? How do you know Tomer? Tomer moved here in 5th grade. I could tell he's an outsider. That tickles. You had a crush on him, huh? - Who, Tomer? So not. Loosen up, baby. That's too strong. - It's good, see? What you put on? - It's like this oil. Don't, Shabat. - But I'm really great at it, eh? Decent. What, decent? Really? Why'd you bring Tomer up all of a sudden? Don't fool me, Gili. He told me all about it. - What did he tell you? Common, go higher. Did he really think I cared? What, that's where your cramps are. Why did you even talk about me? We're friends. We talk. What'd he say? No... I don't feel like it. You can't bring it up and not say anything. You're so sexy like that. Okay, get off me. -No, like... He said you thought he's your boyfriend. And that you called him every day. Bullshit! He's such an insecure kid. Does it tingle? I can't believe that's what he told you. That arrogant brat. You're pretty when you're angry. Sham, Gm yam hands u?. Frankly, nothing happened with Tomer. He's pretty boring, all in all. Omri is much cooler. Omri's quite a son of a bitch. Don't get any expectations with him. Who's getting expectations? We had sex, it was fun. That's it. He makes me laugh. He's the one expecting, if anything. Yeah, but you wouldn't mind going steady. So not. Shabat, you're getting carried away. Fine, here, I'm stopping. I think you so don't get me. I'm getting you perfectly well. - And I think not. Get up, okay? I don't want to. -Let me get up. - I don't feel like it. But you're crushing me. - But I like it. Stop. I want you to enjoy. -Shabat... Look how nice this feels. - Don't. Isn't that nice? - You're crushing me. I'm just playing around. - Cut it out. I'll make you feel real nice. Enough, okay? - Look how wet you are. You're so pretty, lying here in my bed. Can you get up, please? But look how wet you are. Shit. You're just so amazing. Come on, open up a bit. Lift up a bit. Yeah. Are you on the pill? -No. So I'll cum outside, okay? - Put on a condom. I have to feel you. I can't stop thinking about your ass. I watch porn and think of you. Okay, lift a little bit more. You're so amazing. Did you come? -No. Geez, I'm sorry, baby. I couldn't hold myself. What an amazing pussy you've got, huh? I'll gel you a morning-after pill, okay? Love you. Did you enjoy it, though? -Yeah. Who's better, me or Omri? -Don't know. Omri's got a little pecker, doesn't he? I don't remember. Give me a kiss, beautiful. What should I get you? You want something? Take away? No, get up. You're heavy. - I want a bit more. A bit. Okay, let's go. You want a coke or something? I need to get home already. I'm late. Let's take a ride to the center. I don't feel like it. What, honey... we'll go. Stop at the pharmacy. Buy you that pill? I'm hungry too. I don't feel like it. Baby, you have to take it. - I'll get it later. You've got to take it after. I'll manage. You don't want people to see us? It's not that. Then why are you like that? I don't feel like going to the center. And I've got tons of stuff to do. Here. I bought two, just in case. - Thanks. Shabat! Yo, my brother. -What's up? What, this your new girlfriend? Gili, this is Yoav. I think I've heard of you already. Okay, bro, we're off. Bye, man. -Bye, bro. Why are you like that? Like what? Like, quiet and stuff. Don't know. It's kind of a bummer. Did you move? No. On Friday I dropped you off over there. Yeah, I was so out of it that I got confused. But I saw you getting inside. My friend lives there. And you went there at 4 am? Yeah. Her parents are abroad. Who is she? -You don't know her. Maybe I know her. -Well, you don't. Okay, give me a kiss. A proper kiss... My sweet. Bye. -Bye. Guess who sat next to me on the flight? Bar Raphaeli? - No. Nice, though. On my flight back I met her mother. She used to be so hot... Who wants more cake? Someone worked so hard on it. - Who? The bakery... Where's your daughter? She's at the 'Coca Cola Summer Village'. Omri was there now. Had a blast. Omri! Give me your iPhone. I want to show Ilan the pictures. Now? -Yeah, why not? So who's eying me the whole way? Who? -Dudu's ex. She had too much work done. - Yeah, she's all plastic. She's still got a face, though. Where is it? -Let me. Awesome production, I tell you. 'Awesome'? Just a bunch of chicks. Oh sure, for him it doesn't count. - Here. It's, like a 21 year old or something? Cut the attitude -What attitude? Who is she? -That's his girlfriend, his ex. I don't know exactly. Okay, Did you enjoy? Who is that? -How would I know? As if you don't know... Send her a message on Facebook. Just change your profile picture first. Is that you? Where? He's totally wasted. I hope he wasn't stoned. He just shot some heroin, Dad. Coming? Ilan, come, let's kick some ass - Yeah. Let's go. Why'd you show him? Barel, move it. - But I'm in the middle. Move, I'll switch you. Sahar, let my Dad play. Omri. What? There's someone for you. Cool. Here, take mine. Don't let Dad win, huh? -You loser. Hi. How's it going, sweetheart? Damn, I like your look. Yeah? You like it? -I like. Though I wish you were naked. - Why am I not surprised? Come on, come inside. Am I late? You said eight. No, babe, you're just on time. You hungry? Should I whip up a tortilla? Go say hello to everyone. I'll grab you something. Tomer. -What's up, Gili? How was it at the 'Coca Cola'? Was it fun without me? Come on... I'm Yaniv. How's it goin'? Who are you? -Who are you? - I'm the man... I told you about her. - I don't remember. Yeah right. Didn't you say you can't come? Yeah, but I changed my mind. How come? Shit! You confused them. You're just lucky. - Better lucky than sorry. Hey there. - They offered you a drink? You're looking at a pro. Omri's fetching me something. Ilan, you want a refill? -Yeah, why not. Hit me too. -You won't like it. Come on, I need to talk to you. What? What are you doing here anyway? Same as you. What'd you come for? He's just... He's just, like... Like, he's not... Geez. You're so sad. Who's winning? -Hmm, I don't know... But you're much more interesting. - Of course I am. Who ordered some beef? Say, is he bothering you? Who, me? No way. Did you meet my brother? He's 13 today. And this is Sahar, his ugly friend. What about her drink? True. What do you want? - I don't mind. Okay. So let's go outside. So, how are you? - Cool. How was the 'Coca Cola'? What, did I bum you out? I managed even without you... I heard you were here. Yeah. I brought you some stuff... My brother went crazy for you. Why? -You tell me. I did nothing... - if you say so. Let's go to my room. Cool. Damn, you're horny today. Common guys, let's go. Wait, is she into it? - Into what? Sahar wants to join. - Why'd you tell him? But I don't want to go alone. - Relax, I'll help you. You're a pro, huh? I love this song. - Yeah, huh? It's awesome. You even know it? Yeah, it's that black dude. What's all this mess? It's a party, you know. - I'll break your head in. She's a real slut, huh? - Yeah, major league. Damn, you made such mess in here. Hey fatty. How's it going? What's up, you dick? -Tight, shit. Playing poker again? Pass me a hit. You ruined my hand. - Why goin' for a straight, dipshit? Lend her over. - Loosen up, bro. I want to tell you a secret. What's the secret? - Come sit. How, like this? Shabat told me you're a great fuck. How would he know? What a liar. I think he's in love with me or something. Okay, come to the bathroom. - Why? Because I feel like it. But let's wait for them to go. - No, I need you now. Come on. You like that? What? You like making out with me? Yeah. Your brother's here. Oh, Bard, some 'meme. What did you do to him? I don't know. Come on in. He's so nervous... But cute. - You bet he's cute. She's OK, she doesn't bite. Cut it out! He's excited. -Poor thing. Maybe you can give him some... help? What do you mean? - Give him a lick. Don't worry, he'll jizz in a second. So... I'll be back in a bit? Omri... - We'll continue it from here. Be good to him. He's my brother. I'm counting on you. Open the door. What are you laughing about? - Nothing. Have you ever seen a girl naked? - Duh. Porn doesn't count. - I've seen some girls. Doesn't seem that way. - Then show me. -What for? If you want to show me, then show me! You liked that? - Yeah, I did. -Great. You're such a little kid. Touch them. -What? - Touch them. I don't feel like it. -Why? No reason. Well, then, what? What? They say you give good head... Yeah? Yeah, I saw you in that movie. I'm just not into you. As if I'm into you. So why are you here? Cause everybody fucks you. Not you. Fuck off! -Watch it, slut. I said get out. - You're so ugly, yuck. You're pathetic! What happened? - Ugly bitch. -Wait! Well, did you do her? - Yeah, she got it good. Barel, wait up. Omri, end this party. Okay, a sec, Dad. Omri! Now! What's up? -I said now. We'll be quiet, cool? - You can forget about the new car. I want everybody to go home. - Fine. Fine. Fine. You get me? Geez, he's angry, huh? Tell me about it. Shabat, can you drive her home? Why should I? Why not? - She's too ugly for my car. Watch it, huh? Are you coming? Bye, man. Sorry that... -it's all cool bro. Can you drive her? -How can I? Don't you have another helmet? - No bro. Can't you? -My Tom Car?s dead. Tomer? - I don't have a license. Sorry Omri. -Forget it. Bye, em. I'll talk to you later. I'll call you tomorrow, cool? Okay... You need to go home. Sorry. Okay. Girl. -What? Come, I... I want to drive you home. No, it's fine. -Get in. Remind me your name. -Gili. You live in Herzliyah? -Yeah. Haoz Street. You know it? - Sure. -25. Put your seat belt on, please. I'm sorry. Did you notice your shirt is on backwards?
