The girl's boyfriend is Satis - Have you searched his interior? - Grandson of Mrs. Justice Lakshmi Devi Sensitive case, work carefully Another important thing I am getting a transfer from here in two weeks This may very well be my last case We need to solve this case before the media finds out about it - I am doing my best sir. - Your best is not enough for this. You are not IPS yet Even if you are the best student in theory. There is such a thing as activity I have an idea Share it wisely. Talk to him Understood sir, but Whether he likes his current situation, You have to take it as you like, you don't agree at once But after what happened It is not good to let such a brain rust He is ruthless Many cases have been solved in his time Some of it was sent around by our police There is no such thing as a perfect murder In every case, some flow is inevitable Look at that flow and find out how it was eaten Understand the purpose, identify the killer - Any questions? - No sir. Good Class is over ma'am It's ready, ma'am - Come on, where is Sandhya? - Good sir. - I want to ask something. - Let's talk as we go. Got my first assignment sir The case seems a bit confusing Did you feel like a detective? Not the same thing, but a slightly higher quality case Feeling a little nervous - If I receive your blessing. - Best wishes I mean if I get your help I'm sorry Sandhya Came out of the field. Don't let me in again. I don't have the strength to do that Shall we talk about something else? Good sir It's time for me to go to the hospital. Anything else No, sir, you come, I will put you They said to come at 5.30, but now it's 6.30 Now do you understand why we don't get along? You are selfish and vinayaka sorry sir - That's okay He is always there I understand your pain sir Not only as a husband but also as a father, I am a failure Sir, how can you say that it is your fault? It was a bad accident Something happened by accident No explanation, no reason, no one to blame. In this way, there was an uncle and an aunt near the house They have no children love me very much He takes me to the beach every Sunday On December 26, 2004 The day the tsunami came, that was the last time I saw them I couldn't go that day because of a cold Was it luck or bad luck that I got that cold? Noha effect It is in the future that we can know whether the results of a certain event are good or bad My mother did not want to go out that day He said that he wants to watch Voice of India on TV I took him by force If Eheman had not gone, this would not have happened What a surprise this is, sir, you always say that there is no such thing as accidental incidents Everything is part of a plan Sir in my case the dead girl Laila is the main winner of this Voice of India Not only that, see the third photo in this file Mom, why are you sad, say something I am not in a state to speak now. - It could be the last day you go out with me, right? - What is that? I am going to go to another village for college soon Where do you get the time to see your father? Your mother will separate you from me by doing the same thing You also talk about time You don't have time for lawsuits, father. I am doing a mistake honey, what to do? - This queen is right there. - Sorry, dad I didn't mean to hurt you father father The husband said, that is Vinayak Did you go and meet him? Found sir But he still did not get an answer According to the available evidence, we can solve this case ourselves, sir right there - Yes, sir CCTV footage, recordings are all available It has been two months since that girl came to Madras There is no one to call relatives There is a manager. They are trying to find him A girl who doesn't understand anything... Come, I will give you an idea to finish this case quickly There are many of these criminals Everyone danced. Give that one two or three bribes Drop in and finish this case - without being there. - Sir, it is not correct for my IPS, sir Oh... and a great IPS I said what I wanted to say. Your choice Is that Laila baby there? Is she a woman? Who knows how many people he cheated with? Do you know that a girl should be anything? Deposit should be decent. Like you Not there Who doesn't want to be half drawn? I have a desire too. Ask if it is his daughter Hey, talk carefully Tilak is just staying because he said so Or - being idle is not new to you You are the one who lured the police with money He said that he will not come to the case and came to leave after giving this But now he changed his mind That said, I will help you with this case Tell him what I say The case should be completed in another week Or I do what I want to do Are you talking? Go - Where is Balram now? - Moved, sir I will find out where What does the autopsy report mean? Cause of death was suffocation The neck is squeezed from behind - Time of death? - Between 11 - 12 Their maid Megha was the first to see the body Where did you open the house? Madam has given me a key. I will pick him up in the morning I was told to stop I said no - Who came to meet your madam yesterday? - No one. When I was about to leave, the lady came - Mega. - This is coming, lady - Mrs. - That white dress - Put it in the middle. - Okay - Why are you taking pills madam? - Headache. That's it - If the balm is applied, it is over. Shall I hit? - Not yet. He will come. - He said? - The lady's friend is Satis sir. Justice Lakshmi Devi I want to see Layla right now - Thank you. - Sorry sir. The body has been sent for autopsy. A part of Surya collapsed in the distance Give me some time The flames went out and the water became a big ocean Life was born when the rocks were dug and the wind blew The wind blew, the sound was born I was born as a conspiracy of history You were born according to the laws of nature I was sad and I didn't hear the music of your breath who are you who are you Everyone is talking about you. - It is called Voice of India. - Who said? I know who is making these stories Come on, prove it to the world one minute From the village where I am making an album will you sing for me Why did Satis go to his house yesterday? I will take him out for sex Is the album Ohomada Satis? Almost done, love your voice - But it feels like a noise heard somewhere. - O That's why these people who speak are recorded, -maybe You're so weird So, what's next? The dessert what? Don't you know I don't take side dishes? I asked what to do next This is after we're done What is there? Do you propose to a girl here? - What time did you leave? - Around 11:15 - That's your car. - Yes How did you come home at night? A little problem with the car. One and that one came in a cab. Did you see anything unusual or suspicious while at Lailala's house? When getting into the taxi outside Laila saw Mokakhari inside and screamed in fear. Layla what happened? Are you ok - Nothing Satis. Don't worry. I was afraid of the shadow, that's why it's good now See you tomorrow I thought it was ok and left Maybe, I shouldn't have done it. - Did he have a relationship with anyone else? - Sorry I know how you feel This is not an easy issue But an important question Do you have doubts about anyone? Of Laila's friends, I only know Arjun Yes Arjun Vasudevan He is a fashion designer Arjun introduced Laila to Vidya, a model Thank you very much Satis Interviewed at 12.05 Can you go to an apartment in Audagan? Sorry sir, it's a crime scene now It cannot go without the approval of the forensic department What is going on? An investigation regarding a girl, ma'am Why was this not told to me earlier? I tried to call you but it was off. Next time, when you come here, you should come with proper documents Next, the security officer who reported this crime, Marimuthu, was also interviewed My name is Madam Marie Muttu At around 7 in the morning, a mega scream was heard Madam Laila was dead when she came to see what the noise was After that, he called the police and gave information. - When was the last time you saw madam? - Around 10.30 pm - Do you know what time he left? - It's about 11 My car did not start Tomorrow the people from the showroom will come and give this OK sir Layla what happened? Is everything ok do you believe Nothing, Satis, don't worry. Laila, why don't you open the door? Hey, that's why I was scared when I saw the shadow - I am OK. - Are you sure? Sir, your taxi has arrived Yes See you tomorrow Goodbye, I'll go But there was a difference in his voice madam He went to his room to see if everything was okay Then a man's voice was heard inside - what? - Madam V - It felt like Hindi. - What do you mean? - Do you know who he is? - I don't know that. When I came to work, madam's room was covered. Maybe that man would have come when Marudu was on duty I didn't see when I went in. Let's go out - Madam, he came out. - Where is that? - Are you confused? - That's my problem too There is a door on the side if you come through it It's the emergency door. It can only be opened from the inside When the other opens it, the bell rings - You are dead too. - Yes How long were you on duty on the day of the murder? From nine in the morning till nine at night sir A name has been given at 8.30. Who is that I don't know his name sir But Laila always comes to see madam Like the villain in those old Hindi movies He has a short, wispy beard - I told these to Madam first. - It's okay, tell me again - He asked if Madam Laila was there. - What did you say to that? No sir - Did you say it right there? - Really go out, sir. - What is the dead faith? You are the security guard of this apartment. I protect him Pablo When I was a model in Bombay My manager said. I didn't think much of it His mother took care of the orphanage where I lived Now, when I knock on the door, the door opens - Do you say no? - Go and see. Do you know who? That's right He came back as soon as he left - Is this the only CCTV camera? - Yes, sir It was also placed when this building was built. Left it there Did you find out who it is? Investigations. He is not alone here Because the CCTV footage is not clear - The team explains it. - Two days for that? Sir, they must know who that is. Ask Megala to come They left in half an hour Satis came and took Laila to the restaurant The Hindi guy who came at 8.30 rang the bell and went back 10.30 in Marimuthu's shift Satis returns from Laila Restaurant While waiting for a taxi to arrive at 11 Layla saw something and screamed in fear They said there is nothing to come. But Marimuttu says that someone was inside I don't know how he came in and left Laila died in the same house where the roof was with all of them delicious what are you saying Looks like a steal But something has come to steal something you know, Only something in that safe is missing Or why did the thief who messed everything up only have that cupboard? The lock was pushed with difficulty This can't be kicked out. You can only open it This is opened by someone else I don't understand sir There are two hands in this The one who got the second one with that A professional thief There is no sign of forced entry No matter how fast the lamp is pushed There is no way to go that far and fall Yes This is a plan An attempt by the murderer to divert the case The one who completely messed up the house Did you know that the safe was not the only one messed up? It. The key was on the inside of that door No, sir, the door was open Only the key was inside - It was closed when the killer was inside. - Will that happen anyway? Didn't Marimuttu say that there was someone in the house when Mini was killed? - These two are not there. - Two people? The one who killed one The other is the one who saw the murder The murderer tried to open that safe - But because there was a roof, it didn't mess it up. - What? Did not understand The one who did it knows where the one who watched it was It is hidden in this safe - Check if the fingerprints found in this safe match with those in our database. - I will see He must be the thief we are looking for - That means the one who saw the murder. - Okay If he has an agenda, he needs to be on the sidelines But I don't know how he got inside this house. Anyway, I have an idea I will tell you when the time comes sir You too Was anyone at home when you were working yesterday? No, just the lady Could someone else be hiding inside, right? There is no way to be there. I finished the whole game. Everything is checked before going - Did you check that safe? - Kala sir. I took a dress from it and put it in the middle. The key is always at the entrance. No sir - Think carefully and say Which side were you looking at yesterday? Outside sir It was tangled and torn in my clothes Does one come here white with a little beard? Or are you asking Bablu? He came as soon as he was standing, he came ten days earlier. Run away cute - Who is this? - That's our fun brother, sir The lady likes him a lot, but he is a little bit intelligent. In front of the house. - Did you question him? - No sir. I don't know if it will be a reliable witness, sir. - Stay out, I'll talk again. - OK sir Let's look at Arjun Vasudevan As for Arjun, he is a little angry He is my best friend The end is straight - Sorry. - Back straight, start Oh god, you don't care I met him when I went to Bombay as my first design internship Don't be afraid of him Honey, this is all messed up He does that to get his girlfriend's attention So what, both are happy, right? Two months before the jewelry style Arjun had recommended me They asked me to come to Madras from Bombay. It was removed saying no From something that happened to me in those two days Changed my mind completely Sorry, - yes. - Is Arjun there? - You This is your post what is the problem - You are the problem. - I leave. - Maha loku loka rupa beauty - The fault of not putting it where it was? - Go up a hill and run away ok boy come from there Arjun has come from the police - Is Arjun anyone? - He is number one Why is it said there? This is what he did, and he is now in the hospital who is this - Pramila Why didn't you complain to the police? Pramila did not want to help No one has the guts to ask him that It is number one in this field Do not catch in practice Even knowing this, Laila came three days ago Let's do it well this time, sir Instead of looking for the usual fashionistas, just something different You are a persistent fashion brand. Those age groups Sorry guys I want to ask something about your marriage Arjun do you fry? Yes, not only that. Sir, the girl you are going to marry is the daughter of a big politician What is this doing? Came to see Pramila. Is on life support What is the answer to him? Are you threatening? You are going to be dangerous to the girl you are going to marry. Layla, get out of this situation Stop the marriage Don't tell me where my connections are going I haven't started yet, Arjun Sorry for the trouble Sorry to keep you guys waiting - that's fine Interrogation of Arjun Vasudev - What happened to your hand? - And He tripped and fell to the ground Let's talk about Layla. That was very shocking He is a good friend to me But three days ago for you and Laila It is said that there was a big fight regarding the girl named Romela. It's a small dispute. That is all. If the person you want to fry buys these now, you can lose him, right? What are you going to say now? Purpose? Mr. Aravin Vasudevan This one is enough to kill me Looking at your history It looks like there. But I have nothing to do with Layla's death. Romila is addicted to drugs, which gave me a bad name in the industry So I wanted to take him under my control - Why are you bothering me? - Do not - I said no, didn't I? - Hey, what the hell are you doing? Are you a big boss for marrying a big politician's daughter? Don't read like crazy. Why is he being dragged into this? Leaving, who do you think you are? I do what I want. Go marry him. -Hey stop. Let me stay in my slot. Oops - Arjun I didn't hit him. It's an accident. FYI, the person I'm about to fry knows about this Where were you the day Laila was killed? In this studio Prepared for a fashion project - Went home early in the morning. - There... Who is here? You were not in your building for an hour and a half This is the CCTV scene on the street corner It clearly shows that you went to 11 and came back to 12 That.. I need some rest At 10.53 Laila has sent a message to your phone - Will you read it? - OK OK... He said that he wanted to talk about something important and come soon. The door on the side was open and he said to come through it It was said that they were talking to come to an agreement. But when he left, the door was closed Why, you could have gone through the main entrance. I didn't think about it because I was told by the side door. Tried to make a call and heard a male voice But the phone record shows canceled calls I don't know that. I heard a man's voice You can hear without picking up the phone They think that we are being cheated. But that's the best we have now It is also from Laila's house. If you open the side door, the bell rings, right? Stopping one is not a big deal If there was an obstacle between that bell and the iron that strikes it It does not make a sound But Laila may not have done this. Someone else has opened this door Is he the second one we are looking for? Not Arjun comes in third Can you tell me in a way that I can understand? I am still confused by these things. This is where the Sandhya case becomes interesting I am passionate about it Thanks Arjun, let me know if you get any new information Let me know if you are going out of town Definitely. Discussion ends at 11.50 am Vinod has come from the police to see you Come out a little The fact that I met Vinod is also an interesting incident Hey, don't go to the ball. Did you come? Did you find my car? Are you crazy - That's where everyone talks to me. The value of something is felt only after it is lost Vinod is like that I understood his special ability Every day with him Became a part of my memories I really missed him Do you know who this is? Say Laila Layla is my best friend Best friends must have told you many secrets, right? Have you been told anything like that? Are you just telling me? What happened Do you like me or him? - Satis? - Yes That and I are making an album. That is all. You are always my friend. Swear - I swear He is a bit quiet Hey sat is, seems to be working till night hey - I have something to say Satis, are you okay? Satis Satis What is that girl's name? Yamini - Yamini Yamini Did you say anything else? Whatever it is, tell me without hesitation It is easy for us to find the person who killed Laila I know Lailawa Marapukena can you identify Like a good worker These people are called Savans People like this have a special ability for some things Find out his last week's activities soon Where was he staying? Who did you meet? What came in is what went out Tell them to collect exactly This is the reason why I decided to come to Madras from Bombay Sit down, don't worry. Good work - Thanks, that says a lot about me. - Aditya Kaushak hi I am here as a fashion representative Do you like fashion? No... not really I came to Bombay to become a singer That's why I don't want to be an artist Don't be so quick Ms. Laila With the name of a model, you can go to the top of the music scene We can support each other This is my card Just say that you will support I will show you a big star. Be careful Have you seen the Bombay skyscraper? Isn't it beautiful? But don't be fooled by that. This is a jungle Now the law of the jungle is as old as the sky Vrukatan keeps it for their prosperity If those rules are broken - death Although you think that you are only beautiful, you also have good intelligence In a few days you are going to go around the world You prepare yourself. Be selfish Your body is my money Even if your weight increases by 50 grams, I am not thinking of firing you - Control body weight. - Good ma'am Little by little I saw my life changing before my eyes I started to think that I was living a false life One day something happened that seemed to put an end to all these things Got an opportunity to go international beyond India Madam, believe me, Layla is the right person for that Yes 100% of the time I will sign the contract with me bye So Laila needs to celebrate this I don't thank you Let's have a glass of champagne and nothing will happen. Trust me I don't drink. Ok good good That's a hook I'll take this, thanks Not with water It is said that if you mix it with water, you will die Now we don't need it. Let us calm down drink now I promised to make you a big star Now it is going to be fulfilled They said to come to celebrate. A signature between you and the world A priest between that signature and you The priest gave the order Now what is the problem? What does the priest get? Is the priest guilty? I will behave like a gentleman I promise - Can I use your bathroom? - Of course On the right side Hey you are very lucky man Ekta, Karishma, Vidya, Bhimbal Bimble What is the name of the nation? Like saying "bimbo". It should be a name Layla... Layla... Layla... Layla... Who is this time? My goodness Not you, honey Layla... I'm going to show the world baby Violation of the law of the jungle is inevitable - death Okay, you danced as others told you for so long, didn't you? Do what feels right in your heart now Practice being selfish Layla, are you okay baby... are you coming or am I coming honey? Is this you A cute woman what happened etc I don't want to do this project. What And the contract? You know what, just shut up I don't know if we will meet one day Maybe if I didn't go to that hotel room I think I might be alive Good evening sir - Varen Balram, how? - Good sir. Come on, let's see what this case is about Who is that Yamini? Find - Good sir If you have a beard, you can say you are a policeman So why shave? That's it, father shaves, he doesn't shave his mustache There is a law there When will I grow a beard? That's right, honey, if you listen to dad, you'll grow a beard in two years - You go to sleep. - Good But father, you are beautiful with a beard Searched everywhere sir There is no case for this number - How does it disappear? - I don't know, sir If you want, see the prison he was in There is usually a copy of that hello I know that you also killed Layla If you want to escape, bring the amount to the place I say - Do you understand? - Hello? I am going to Bombay. Meet Aditya If you go officially, you need a lot of permission But I am a normal person and can be anywhere You inform the police of that province. I will take care of the rest They lied to me that they took Laila's signature on the contract I know you very well The one inside the pants should be inside the pants You are a disgrace to this industry I don't know what you are doing Layla's signature should be on this contract Or I will spend all my time making your life miserable do you understand yes ma'am - beat it Sir, someone from the police has come to meet you Sit in the meeting room I will come say - Laila was killed three days ago We know that Madras existed then When Laila died We also know that you came out of the back door of his apartment What to say about this What should I say? You don't understand my situation, - there Will you be arrested? Arrest me if this happens This has to be taken to the station for an investigation If you help, your time will be saved. What - What do you want to know? - Your story Start from scratch How do you know Laila? Since when How long do you know? And more things A few months ago, I met him on the Voice of India show I knew as soon as I saw him that he was special I thought I should introduce myself as a designer Laila also liked it At that time, an international brand drew attention to Lyla In a short time that too in Bombay No one has seen so much success. But success is also a curse He lost his high star quality A five-year contract Crores of money The power of the world itself He asked me to come to my hotel room to discuss the contract This is something to celebrate. Let's drink some champagne I don't, thank you Orange juice - I will take this. This is good. - Good savings - Good for you. - Thank you I'm sorry etc It completely overwhelms me I don't know what to say So don't say anything. Just kidding But sign the contract. Otherwise everything becomes a problem. Ok can I use the bathroom Definitely, this is for you Hey do you sign? The contract Goodbye, I thought, I don't think that's right for me Thanks a lot anyway That was the last day I saw him Did you come to Madras and see him? It is also true that he went to Madras and that he met Pablo. He asked him for help to meet Layla Two months without even knowing where it was. He told me that he is in Madras. - What is the relationship between Lylai and this? - I don't know I have seen Pablo with Laila several times It was Pablo who asked me to come to Laila's house. He said he would leave the main door open so that no one could see him through the side door. When I went inside, Laila was dead - Why didn't you tell the police? - I was very scared This is not enough of the problems I have I am not thinking about anything. Came back - Thank you very much for the support. If necessary you will have to come to Madras Do not leave the village without informing us. This is the person we are looking for You have to stay within five kilometers. Let's find out The duck that laid the golden eggs was cut at once, right? Come where I say with a crore Or you will have to get sticks in prison. Do you understand - Who is talking? - Your father Why didn't you tell the police?

Wasant said about this At that time I felt confident But now I understand How much you suffer because of me I feel afraid that you will leave me You must have been holding on to life for me you go I'm sorry mom I'm very sorry I thought that I was holding your hand for so long - But... - Dad... - I understand that you are the one holding on. - Dad Do what you want to do Whatever you decide now Father is with you sorry sir I know this is not going to be easy But he must have gone to a better place now The one who answered your question committed suicide What is the answer to this?

Get on the register get up one minute Hurry up let's go shall we go - come soon hello - Sir, can you come to Vellore Jail soon? What happened A girl named Yamini was killed in Erode 12 years ago Judge Lakshmidevi is handling that case Eight years ago My son had come to see you regarding a case You solved it I can never forget that help sir. The record store is just the name, nobody uses it We also have a copy of this Where is that? Brother, take a look at this Three people killed themselves during my service This is one of them This is someone who killed his own daughter, sir Always small hearts A little with me Lives in fear What is this? You wrote it a little before you died - Take a photo? - Take it, sir What is the relationship between Yamini's murder and Laila's murder? I'm confused too what? Is Laila dead? Don't act like you don't know. What is your relationship with Layla? I'll tell you because you ask - Is Laila my wife? - What are you reading? Did you say manager? - Do you know why you ask? - Look at this If he was in jail for five years for bank robbery - If you go in for murder, you won't come out, be careful. - Good. Now what do you want to know? Do you know who this is? This is Laila's agent He told me that he wanted to meet Laila He went to Laila's house to talk about it But the house had a roof You didn't go to Layla's house, how did you get the fingerprints inside? I did not say that I did not go to Layla's house, madam I did not go there on the day you mentioned. That is all ma'am The DGP asked you to meet him at his cabin Did Madam Dhanapalan come? Sendilnadan has also come with him, right? Would you like to bring some tea? If you want, I will tell you to put it separately as if it were put in jail If you want me to call it Biryani like you get in a star hotel? Did you forget that you were jailed for saying this? Why are you leaving or not? What, sir, seems to put his head through a small gap If you can't catch the killer Do you bring the one who didn't do this and threaten him and put him inside? No.. You felt the dangers I know very well that you did not commit that murder You don't have the brains or the energy to do that You can only think like a fox. But I have seen that murderer with my own eyes Anyway, he was alone in that safe Can't even make a sound.. Unstoppable You were closing the door at the right time He tried to open it, but he couldn't If only that door had been opened for a single moment Imagine what your situation might be Sir, whatever you ask me I have nothing to do with that murder My lawyer came. Look at him first ok We will meet again when we have time It is doubtful Give it to me, sir I'll sign, damn you sir I should have read the truth after giving two There are other ways to know the truth Two of us were asked to follow him in civilian clothes He will definitely get involved with the murderer This was taken from his computer If you get the data of this, you can know with whom he is related. This must be the engagement ring given to Satis Laila. How did Pablo come in through the roofed door? Watch live, why did Pablo go back to Laila's house? Looking at Pablo's phone record Both Arjun Das has spoken to him So both of them were inside that night, right? - So does Pablo know who did this murder? - Okay See for yourself what you can see through the keyhole This closes to the wall There is no way for him to see the murder Bablu has spoken to Arjun before. After that, Aditya. He should see it there In psychology, it is called "sequential recall of memories". Satisui and Laila are coming home again After a while Satis left Arjun came after Satis left He is the one who killed Layla - Arjun what are you doing here? - Shut up How many people like you have seen? Are you threatening me? If you don't, I'll call the police. Going to call the police. Aditya came in by chance This wall is the only place where Arjun is hiding now Now Arjun was not killed. Let's assume that Adi did it Laila Arjun - Listen to me. Give me a chance. - Where did Arjun come in? I thought about what you said I'll be honest, I made a mistake Give me a chance and solve this with Promila Arjun move on. I will see - Laila. - Where did you come from? Calm down a bit go out - a little Let me talk for a minute. I understand my mistake, I'm sorry If I don't sign this contract, my whole life is over - Please.. - Adiv should have thought about this before committing this mistake. Did you say go? How much do you want? You are being stubborn Didn't Arjun who was hiding hear the sound of being killed? You may or may not hear This is just a theory. Laila Laila Maybe if Vinod had done this murder Who is that little boy? Why can't it be? I think it can be right? Jealousy is a common thing It is also not afraid to do anything that is wrong with age But if he was here, Bablu might have tried to contact him But if he was at home You must have seen Arjun and Pablo coming out, right? He is here first Bablu messed everything up Must have gone out the side door But somehow he goes outside and closes the side door skillfully Come on, I'll show you I noticed that there was one less ice cube in the refrigerator It has been placed under the bell so as not to hear the sound of this alarm The ice has melted so that no evidence is lost God, to think that someone would do so much to cover up a mistake It's human nature Arjun is the killer we are looking for It looks like that But something bothers me what is that Yamini Who is this Yamini? I was looking for Yamini The girl named Yamini was killed 12 years ago I still can't believe some of it I think this has something to do with Yamini's case.- What? - How? - I don't know that yet left On the street corner yes ok This is a discipline. He is helping this case hello sir The one who killed Mini It is said that someone has seen it - Do you know anything? - Nothing yet. But getting closer Mr. Satis, this is the reason you came here Because Laila has no relatives Ask for permission to bury the body I'll see what I can do? Anything else I want to go to Layla's house. Will it be allowed? Why He is a memory for me Guitar stick I mean a guitar pick was given I put it there, I want it Not only that, but that place haunts my mind It may take a few minutes Sorry, not right now But the opportunity will come soon Thanks, I'll go Sorry Do you know someone called Yamini? No, I don't know anyone there. Good Now why did it come? Just asked to see his response I don't see any reaction. He is not responsive. Someone who works You will get an answer soon Did you bring the money you mentioned? Say Satis has tried to jump into Laila's house Must be because of that guitar pick He must not have gone looking for the guitar pick Went in for some other reason ma'am What happened? What happened that night Laila? What did I miss here? As a souvenir, I was given a guitar stick that is a guitar pick I put it. I want it I did it too? - Sir - Take a photo of this. - Get clear - Go and see. - Good ma'am sir did you see The murderer gave us a piece of cashew nut people - Will you get anything? - A little, sir did you hear Go and see what happens Go Going - Good sir. Beards and hell Hey, what are you waiting for? Lift up Holding the body and waiting Hey, what are you doing? Going Why is the case over? - Where is the accused? - Killed himself What do you mean? Considering what was written on the mirror as a verbal answer The case was closed Well, hold a press conference tomorrow. And... let's let it be Press conferences are stupid - Hey call a press conference tomorrow morning. - Good sir Get the jeep ready It is clear that everyone here has a story behind them But I'm here to give you this This is what you were looking for. Or is this? I have been in this game for a long time Satis I know how to hear lies Every man unknowingly exposes his low mentality through various actions It is called "Freudian slip". Parapaxis (reading something incorrectly even if it is cleverly done) You missed the guitar pick instead The one called guitar stick It was around 11 o'clock on the day of the murder While waiting for the taxi at the reception counter Laila screamed out You and Marimuthu ran away and knocked on the door But Laila did not open the door Because he was killed So what did you talk about? Laila's conversation was recorded. Connect one. Nothing sir, don't worry Afraid of the shadow. That's it, see you tomorrow Marimuthu is the only one who needs to be convinced He was fooled not knowing that the voice heard inside was Laila's recorded voice You ruined yourself The only evidence This is a planned murder A premeditated murder Exactly 12 minutes and 42 seconds after the end of the song, Laila's scream was heard. Laila, are you all right? Nothing, Satis, don't worry Open the door, Laila Afraid of the shadow. That is all, - I am OK. - Really? Yes, you go see you tomorrow Well, be careful Bye Bye You killed Layla for that Messed up the house He sent a message to Arjun on his phone and went to wait for the taxi. But something you didn't expect fell there. You call Arjun on Laila's phone I will leave the back door open for you to come through But that door was opened before that you doubt That someone saw the murder you committed You came to the police to clear the suspicion As soon as he found out that Bablu saw the murder You killed him Now you want one goat You knew there was a problem between Laila and Arjun So every murder was written in the name of Arjun who are you - Do you know where we met? I am an example of what you cannot do without fear - what? - Why are both not good, my friend? Aren't both good? He was also drugged and killed, the case was closed The only thing that is not really related to this case is going What is the relationship between Yamini and Laila's murder? Did Laila know that you killed Yamini? Killing someone The happiest feeling in the world Mr. Vinayak That feeling Can't be explained by dates It feels like looking at it I will feel brother. Try to find out One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ninety-nine Brother, - Siya Take care inside, brother I am very scared Feelings to satisfy a mind And also To satisfy a feeling and mind save They said they could not open that box but I wanted to see how long he could stay inside He started screaming Listen to it, my nerves bloomed. That's when I understood This is not about Yamini This is completely about me How long can I stay without opening that item? Brother, please, brother My brother will kill me soon 12 hours and 42 minutes His breath stopped I was born blind. Two years after birth No eyesight I only saw this world through my ears I have not seen my parents They died in a plane crash Lived alone That's when Yamini came into my life. Yamini is my world Even now when you close your eyes Yamini's voice makes me cry Laila tried to snatch it away Satis what's going on? Are you ok Who is Yamini? Started asking questions is your girlfriend Yamini's voice started to fade away after asking questions Yamini did not like that do you say We don't want him among us. Kill him If you lost Laila Yamini is standing next to me, isn't it? That's it Yamini's smile He will not submit to anyone You are a sick person All of us Please ask each other questions Ask each other questions If you let go, they will grab the mic How do you say that Arjun did this murder? Looking at the evidence we have gathered It is clearly seen that Arjun did this murder Not only that... Arjun couldn't bear the guilt. He committed suicide by writing that he did the murder - Is there any proof that Arjun did this murder? - Just wait. You will get the details you want after this discussion Now the press conference is over I will get you the details you need - Sir, Sir.. - Understand sir please - No more questions. I said, I'm leaving now What is going on in the evening? The case was solved sir. Arjun used the writing on the mirror as evidence and closed the case. But you know that Arjun did not commit this murder, right? But there is not enough evidence to say that Satis was the murderer. Listen to the third part of this Listen at exactly 12 minutes and 42 seconds Now this case is yours! Nothing, Satis, don't worry Oh, I was afraid of a shadow, that's it I'm fine now Actually, you go see you tomorrow ma'am - I want to meet you sir - Wait a minute, there is someone inside. - Good ok sir - Madam, Sir said to come. - Good It has not even been six days since the report was given to the media They say to take back what I said Is this fair? Yes After five years, I feel like I'm going to get a promotion. Don't lose it, Mrs. Sandhya No, sir, there is evidence in this If you send this once Don't you understand when I say it once? How many times to say? What should I do after hearing that? Put it in the trash Throw this case in the trash See if there is any other case do you understand oh - Sir - Sir file. - Bring smoke first. Ok sir - My circle Sorry Now I have proof that you killed Laila Come alone to the street near the park. Let's talk Follow me carefully - Is there an ambulance? - Good On that side. Slowly Neck bent , face roof If he has anything personal, take it Put them in the ambulance? A lot of blood - Clean up. - Man, there are lungs. Cover your face - Let's go Push - Do you have lungs? Yes. - Okay lift up - Be careful Put it here - Put his personal things in this. - Good See if anything fell? - Now let's go. - Good - keep away. - Follow me No matter how much you win in life We will definitely lose to death They say they are blind to the law But according to this world He never closed his eyes what went wrong There is always a way around Thank you Nayak
