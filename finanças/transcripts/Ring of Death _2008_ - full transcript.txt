Hey, Warden! Give me some real competition! You're doing a splendid job, Mr. President, as always. President! It ain't over yet. What? That's right. All day. We can do this all day. I don't need no pipe. That would be unfair. Aaaaaaaah! You got blood on my shirt, you know that? You want some more? Huh? You want some more blood? Aaaaaaaaah! Aah! All right. That's enough, now. Clean this place up and take the President back to his cell. This will be very good for business. Very good. Emilio is dead. Write it up as an accident, but it's a pretty thin excuse. Make it happen. The cons in general population are on edge. It's getting down right scary in that cell block. It's a prison. It's supposed to be scary. Not like this. I've got everything under control. What's going on, Man? You haven't said a word since we left school. You bummed out from what happened? Well, Buddy, don't be. Listen, somebody needed to stand up to those bullies who were picking on that little girl, right? And you did. You're like my hero. But I got beat up. Oh! Yeah, I've gotten beat up a few times in the years, and it's never fun. But the point is, you protected somebody that needed help, okay? My teacher says fighting is bad. Your teacher's right. Fighting is bad. But you were a fighter once. You fought bad guys when you were a cop, and you're not bad. And you are the best. Dad? Hmm? Are you gonna tell mom? Nah. We'll keep it our little secret, okay? Your mom's got enough on her mind right now. Who loves me? I do. Who loves you? You do. Yeah. I just finished talking to the principal. Did you have a fight? No, it wasn't a fight fight. It was a little shoving match. Boys being boys. He's fine. Inside, Young Man. Bye, Dad. Bye, Bud. I'm hoping you told him how disappointed you are about him getting in a fight. Oh, um... Not exactly. He looks up to you for approval, okay? You're his role model. I got to... I got to start my second shift in less than an hour, so... Have a good day. Hey, Partner. What, you don't return your phone calls? That's former partner, Steve. So I hear congratulations are in order. You're a fed now. Big time. Yeah, well, the opportunity came up, and I moved over to the Bureau. What do you want, Steve? Remember Emilio Diaz? Of course. Putting away that son of a bitch is one of the best things we ever did. Emilio Diaz was up in Cainesville State, and they racked up 12 deaths this year. Even for california, that's a lot. To me, it sounds like someone's doing a great job. That's what we want you to find out. Me? We need somebody on the inside. We tried leaning on the guards, a few of the prisoners, but nobody's talking. Cainesville's like it's own country, and we can't get past the border. This is Karl Golan. He's been the warden there for over a decade. He worked his way up from prison guard. Let me show you something. We pulled this off the web feed a few months ago. Tried to hang a tracker on it, but it shrugged us off in a hurry. We never found it again. We believe that Golan is running illegal gambling and fighting over the internet. Great. So put him under investigation. We tried. Numerous times. But nothing sticks to Golan. We got nothing on him. So far. Yeah, here we go. Now, we want to send you in as a convict. We'll doctor up your records, make it stick. Why me? 'Cause you're a natural fighter, born and bred. The real question is, why would you agree to do it? The truth is, there's only one real reason.. Your son. Look, you been kicked off the force. You're separated. You and your family are struggling financially. I've got the Bureau to agree that if you do this, they'll set up a $250,000 trust for your son. He'll be able to go to whatever school he chooses, have the chance for the future that he deserves. And there's a bonus. Once this is over, you and I will be partners again, only this time, with the FBI. You think this over. Golan here. Hey, is Diaz fighting tonight? No, he's dead. That's a bummer. He made us a lot of money. Really? Yeah, he did. That's very interesting. How much money are we talking about? Lots of money. Please keep me posted as things develop, yeah? I think we should try to duplicate the situation just as soon as possible, don't you? Hmm. All right, let's wait for our backup, catch the son of a bitch in the act. I'm not letting this guy do it again, you hear me? Burke! Burke! Sick son of a bitch! It's okay. You're okay now. Raar! Dad! Hi, Bud. I thought I wasn't gonna see you until next weekend. I figured I'd come by early and we'd shoot some hoops. What do you say? Awesome. Cool. Hey. Where's your mommy? She's still inside. She's sleeping. She worked late last night. She did? Yeah. So we should be quiet, huh? Yeah. Okay. Dad? Yeah, Bud. When are you gonna come home? I'm trying. Bud, I just... Does that mean you're never coming home? No. Never say that. Never say never. I just miss you. Oh, Man. I miss you too. Raar! Okay! White flag! White flag! White flag! Burke. I'm in. Good. Now, remember the old man. They call him Pop, but the others know him as the Librarian. He's a yellow. He gets preferential treatment from Golan. He's working with us because he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in Cainesville. Now, you leave your notes in the pages of "The Man in the Iron Mask." He has a connection with one of the food suppliers. He gets him his contraband.. Cigarettes, candy, booze, drugs. He sends a letter to this guy, we'll get it. And what if this plan of yours doesn't work? We pull your ass out. Burke. Good luck. Yeah. Sorry about that, Officer. Step away from the car! Get out of the vehicle with your hands up! Clear the vehicle! Clear it! Come on! On your knees! Down! Down! Call it in! Code 4! Based on the evidence before me, your violent actions speak for themselves. And your refusal to accept the advice of your counsel leaves me no other choice. Burke Wyatt, I hereby sentence you to five years at the Cainesville State Penitentiary. You are remanded into custody. Bailiff. What'd they get you for? Oh, yeah, I know, I know. I'm not supposed to ask. That's what my lawyer told me.. Never to ask what people are in for. I get nervous. I start babbling, which is... I got busted for dealing. I confessed to everything before they got me out to the car. If I were you, I would definitely keep my mouth shut. Off the bus, Fishies. Let's go! Double-time! Line it up! You heard him, Ladies. Let's go, move. Straight ahead. You think we could be cellmates? Can we request cellmates? I think we should be cellmates. Because you're the quiet type and I'm more talkative. Welcome to Cainesville, Jabberjaw. Rule number one.. No talking. You eyeballin' me, Boy? Line it up. Straight line. Straight ahead. Welcome, Gentlemen, to your new home. My home. Now, I fully expect you all to be as comfortable as possible while you're here, and I also fully expect you all to treat your new home.. Our home.. With the respect that it deserves. Proper conduct is required. At all times. Now, some of you men may have been sent here To repent for your transgressions. But that does not mean that you can act like animals. No, no, no, no. You are men. And you will act as such. My prison does not abide by the rules of the outside world. Those rules are beneath us. Now, you will find that I am a fair man.. A fair man with a deep, deep love for his home. And you all need to respect that at all times. Well, then, let's go in, shall we? We need to get you all settled. We'll have plenty of time to get to know one another later. Plenty of time. Aw, yeah! Fresh meat! Over here, Sweetheart! That's my salad tosser right there! Come on, Baby, come on! I'm not gonna make it. All the new prisoners have been processed, Sir. Any candidates, Mr. Colson? Only one, but I think you're gonna like him. Oh? Burke Wyatt, 35. Did a stint in the Marines. Wonderful. What's Mr. Burke in for this time? He's a fighter. Stole a police car. Kicked the crap out of two cops. Resisted arrest. Ooh, I like him already. Have my two favorite hoodlums pay Mr. Burke a visit. We'll see if he's got any spine. Yes, Sir. Spine. Hoo-whee! Wake up. Wake up! That's it? That's all you got? Oh. What is he, a gym instructor? Come on, Warden! Come on, you got to give me something better than this! Oh, yes. Ho ho! Hey! Yes? What is it, Colson? We took Ripper to his cell. His hand was completely mangled. Oh, what a shame. I'm going home for the night, Sir. Maybe you should go home too. I am home, Colson. Sir? You all right? Good night, Mr. Colson. Good night, Sir. Open cell doors. Step out and call it out, Ladies. This ain't the Holiday Inn. Let's go! Watson. Here. Lancer. Here. Wyatt. Here. Micelli. Here. May. Here. O'Reilly. Here. Chow. Here. Pope. Here. Farley. Here. Welcome to Kindergarten for Convicts. Roll call 12 times a day. Tommy Micelli. Should I call you New Fish? Name's Burke. Nice to meet you, Burke. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Who-o-o-o. Come on! Come on. Ooh-wheee! Nice face. What happened? Let me give you some free advice, New Fish. Behind these walls, don't ask questions. Makes people uneasy. Now, how about doing me a favor? Get off the bench and let me show you how a real man works out. Thank you. You better watch over your bitch. His name's not bitch. It's Lancer, Man. Then you better watch over Lancer. Or somebody bigger's gonna come and snatch him up. Actually, you better watch over yourself. Looks like your girlish good looks caught the eye of our resident Hillbilly Rapist. The Dyslexic Duo.. Yuli and Macon. Run with a gang called Dirty White Boys. Got maybe three brain cells between 'em both. That's on a good day. Do me a favor? Yeah? Let me work out in peace. Absolutely. Thank you. Stay on your own side. Lunch is served. Mmm. Mmm, smells so good. I'm not hungry. Come on, Sweetie, I made your favorite.. Penne. Look at all that sauce. All that extra sauce is for you! Come on. Mom, do you think Dad misses me? Of course he misses you. I don't think he cares about me. Wh.. Why would you say that? If he cared, why would he get himself in trouble so that he'd be away from us? Your father's a good man. I really miss him. I know. I do too. I do too, Baby. You met my boy O'Reilly. He's a good one. If you say so. Hi, Micelli. Why don't you tell me about this place? I haven't been a tour guide for a while. Anyway, there's three gangs that run this place. Over there, Sons of the Free. They're Skinheads. They hate everybody here. Here and the outside too. Then you got The Latin Kings. Mexican Mafia. Used to be run by a crazy guy named Emilio. Emilio? Yeah, he got transported to another pen. Then you got the most powerful gang in Cainesville. They call themselves The Disciples. It's run by The President. The President? Hey there, Boy. You got some candy in your pocket? It looks like the two hillbillies like your boy. Lancer. Lancer. Hey, hey. You got a phone call. What? Yeah. We'll talk. Yeah, we'll talk. Come here. Look at me. Look at me. You're in prison now, Lancer. It's not 86th and Broadway. Keep your eyes open. Keep your head up. All right. Wait here. Oh, okay. Look who it is.. Frick and Frack. Hey, Sweetheart. What do you meatballs want? I'm gonna get up in you just like a doggie. Cut him! Congratulations, Mr. Burke. You've only been in my prison for two days, and you've already racked up two assault charges. Bravo. You don't waste any time, do you? Not that it really matters.... But it wasn't my fault. You're right. It doesn't matter at all. Wrong place, wrong time, self-defense.. I don't accept any excuses whatsoever. Golden Gloves. Oh, yes. I pounded the leather in my day. Cracked a few skulls. Nothing so sweet as the sound of fists on flesh, don't you think? You know, when I hear that sound, I get so chuffed. Well, Semper Fi, Soldier. Says in your record that you were in Force Recon. Mmh. I can tell just by looking at you that you're a fighter. I was a soldier myself. British Special Forces. S.A.S. Well, I guess you figured it out by now, Son, but this is my kingdom. Any chance for an appeal, any hope of you ever getting out of here, is in my hands now. I just became your good God Almighty. I'm a nonbeliever. You've got guts. I like that. I respect that. I need that. So... This is your lucky day, Mr. Burke. I will write up my report of you in your favor if you are willing to get your hands a little dirty again. And what is it you want me to do, Warden? You'll find out. Soon enough. Mary, I thought my public defender went over this with you. I don't want you coming here, Mary. Do you understand me? If you come here again, I will refuse your visit. Listen, I want you to know that I've talked to a lawyer, and I think you got a really good shot.. No. I do not want your help. Not this time. Please don't do this. We're done. I'm done. Come get me. What am I supposed to tell our son? Tell him I love him. That's a pretty little lady you got there, Wyatt. I'll bet she gets lonely at night with no man in her bed. You think she's gotten a copper yet? My Sandbox, my rules, Son. Come on, Chinaman! Mr. Wheaton. Warden Golan here. Golan. Right on schedule. I thought you'd like to know the feed went live just a few minutes ago. Dahlia, can I see the Cainesville feed, please? Hang on one second. My fans are gonna love this. We got to think about switching to high-def equipment if the subscribers list keeps growing. Absolutely. How's the betting going tonight? Uh... Wow. It's through the roof. You know, the dollar amount tripled because of the unexpected death last week. The poor folks, they got their dog fights, their cock fights. But the rich folks, they want something a little more exotic. Mr. Wheaton, are we really in the snuff film business? Well, death sells. Yes, it does. And considering the money involved, you might want to think about arranging another little accident. Mmh. Splendid idea. So... Who's up next? A new face. A recent acquisition. Someone who I think has a lot of potential. Who's gonna bust his cherry? I'm going to put him in The Pit with Spider. I think it's best to start him off strong. Baptism by fire. Wow. Testing a new guy against Spider? That's like baptism by flamethrower. The guy's an animal. He's gonna kill him. He's gonna kill him... Which is good. I like it. I like it a lot. Yes, I thought you would. All right, I got to go spread the word. I'll call you after the match. Excellent. Let's go, Burke. Get up, Boy. I said get up, damn it! All right! Wh.. What happened? What are you doing, Man? What's going on? Where are you taking me? What did I do? Get your hands off! Get off of me! You move, Maggot! Good luck. What are you doing, Man? Mr. Burke? Burke Wyatt. Welcome to prime time, Mr. Burke. Booyah! Aaah! Stay down. Oh, Baby! Oh, man! Hot damn! That's what I'm talking about! This guy's an animal. That's a nasty cut you've got there, Mr. Burke. You ought to be more careful. I knew I was right about you, Mr. Burke. One warrior can always spot another. Yeah, he's a real badass. you know, Colson... You've been stroking that thing since I got here. You gonna keep jerking it off or are you gonna use it? You don't want to mess with me, Boy. Make yourself useful, Mr. Colson. Go on your nightly rounds. So... How did you feel breaking that skinhead's bones like matchsticks, hmm? From where I stood, you seemed to be enjoying yourself. That son of a bitch tried to kill me. Oh, that would have been the coup de grĂ¢ce. Yeah, sorry, Warden. I don't speak French. But I do know where this is going. And I'm done. You make it sound as though you have a choice. Understand this, Mr. Burke. You're done when I say you're done. Now, remember the old man. They call him Pop, but the others know him as the Librarian. He's a yellow. He gets preferential treatment from Golan. He's working with us because he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in Cainesville. Pops, how you doing? Boring as hell in here. You know what? Give me a couple. Now, leave your notes in the pages of "The Man in the Iron Mask." I'm gonna take this one. Thank you. See you next time. He has a connection with one of the food suppliers. He gets him his contraband.. Cigarettes, candy, booze, drugs. He sends a letter to this guy, we'll get it. Let's go. Move it. Hello. Got some leads. Need more time. You'll hear from me when I have more. Ooh-whee! Looky looky. Ah, I see you've been initiated into our little world. To be honest, I wasn't sure you walked it like you talked it. Thought you might end up mopping the floor with that pretty face of yours. Hey, listen. Last night was just a warm-up to see what you got. They're gonna come at you real quick. No, I don't think so. Man, this is Cainesville. Regular law don't apply here. He doesn't get it yet, Man. He will. I don't think you two get it. Maybe if one of you Mooks said no once in a while, Things might change around here. Hey, hey, hey. You say no, you lose everything. And what more can I lose, O'Reilly? How about your family, your friends, anything that means anything to you? And they make you watch. And then when you've seen all the horror there is to offer, put a bullet in the back of your head. So what's the Warden got to do with all this? I don't know, Man. But when I'm in that Pit and I look up at that observation window, I see a bunch of rich cats in fine suits with a bunch of bitches hanging all over them, laughing and joking, looking down on us beating the shit out of one another. Yo, Man. Who the hell is that small guy? Name's Milton. Milton Kennedy. But everyone in here calls him The President. He's the reigning champion of this little thing of ours. Most of us in here, we go to The Pit 'cause we ain't got no choice. The President.. He does it 'cause he enjoys hurting people. Nice. I wanted to see the man who took down Spider myself. Burke. Burke Wyatt. I'm Chow. Pleasure. I faced Spider in The Pit once before. He fought dirty. Cute. I'm... I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I-I didn't see you. You didn't see me? You didn't see me? Bring your ass here. Punk, why'd you do that? Huh? You see me now? Huh? Hey. Let him go. You talking to me? No, I'm talking to the other 300-pound black guy holding up the white guy.. Let him go. Oh, you don't know who I am, huh? I'm The President. Well, I didn't vote for you. Oh. Oh, you got jokes? Yeah. You're a comedian or something, huh? Yeah. We're gonna see how funny it is when your blood is splattered all over this floor. Uh, excuse me, excuse me. Mr. President, I'm really sorry. He's a new guy and he's not that smart. And he doesn't understand how things work. Maybe he needs a lesson. What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take him around and show him the ropes. We don't want anyone to get hurt. Hey. You just bought a pardon. But you.. I'm gonna see you again real soon. In the little thing we call The Pit. Just me and you. Wyatt Residence. Tommy? Dad! Hey, Champ. How you doing? I, um... I just wanted to call and hear your voice. I've been shooting hoops every day. Just like you taught me. Good man. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm.. I'm doing okay, Bud. Hey, Champ, um... Don't worry about it, okay? I'm kind of at a loss for words, too. I just... I just wanted to call and tell you that I love you and I miss you. When are you gonna come home? Soon. Soon, I hope. Real soon. Hey, Bud, don't tell your mom I called, okay? She's, uh... She's gone through enough. I won't. I.. I know you didn't do what they said you did, Dad. You're the greatest guy I know. You're a good son. I love you. I love you. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Hey, Pop. Thank you for that. Hey, not bad. "The Man in the Iron Mask." One of my favorites. You all right? Bag his ass. Who do you think you are, huh? I'm not fighting. No? No. Mr. Colson. Cute kid. Sure love to tap that wife of yours. Ain't it a bitch, Wyatt? You see these tears, Punk? They're symbols of the souls I've taken in this cage. Yeah. Come on. Let's see what you got. Now that's entertainment. All right, Jen? Jolly good, Mr. Burke. Crying man won't be able to fight again for months. You stay away from my family. I'll tell you what.. You keep fighting, and you'll have nothing to worry about. Your family will be safe. How do I know that? You don't. You're dead, Golan, you hear me? I swear to god, you're dead! You hear me? You keep my family out of this! The eyes of a wolf or a lion. The eyes of a killer. That's what Ricks is finding out tonight. From where I sit, it looks like Golan is toying with him, using every combination he knows. There's Ricks' response.. But there's that big right hand! Ricks is on the ropes. And another big right hand! There you go, you son of a bitch. How do you like that? Looks like it's going to be a standing eight. They'll back in the ring now. I think Golan has decided to quit toying with Ricks and get down to business. He's really working on him. Golan lands another punishing combination. But Ricks is game. He didn't quit. That's right. Take that, you bastard. And now he's on the ropes. And Golan is still fresh. He's hardly broken a sweat. There it is! Like a thunderclap, this fight is over. Golan has retreated to his corner, but he looks like a man who feels that he has more to prove. This is why you're hearing the words "Contender" and "Title bout" when it comes to... Can't you just help me out? Please, I just drove all the way here. You can't force a man to do what he don't want to do. Even a convict's got rights in this state. He doesn't want to see you, he doesn't want to see you. Please. I'm sorry. There's nothing more I can do. Thanks, Pops. This is my favorite. I can assure you, our product is unlike any other. Terrific. I'll make sure I'll send you the encrypted password and link to the website. Enjoy the show. Okay. Talk to you later. Putz. Another client? Yeah, another wealthy, jaded fight fan. Thinks he's seen it all. He has no idea. When he sees your guys pounding the crap out of each other in The Pit, That's gonna be the beginning of an avalanche of cash.. Week after bloody week. Do you know I've raised the subscription rate 300% without one complaint? Well, I'm not surprised. You've managed to keep your end of the bargain, Mr. Wheaton. Although I must admit, when you first came to me with the idea of staging fights for profit, I thought you were out of your mind. Well, what can I say. I know vice. I know weakness. I know a good show when I see one. Let me show you something. Okay. Do you see that? That is a list of every subscriber. Oh, you've been busy. Yes. Now... You notice how the money goes up when the blood begins to flow? Well, that's what I've been talking about. You've got to turn up the heat. Then we can make some more money. Hit that. Unh. You got to stay in shape. Never know when you're gonna end up fighting The President. I want to make sure I'm alive to see my release date. You got people on the outside? I got a whole life waiting for me out there. As soon as I get out of Cainesville, I'm going right back to work for the family. Family? What are you talking about? Irish Mob. Oh. I collect a few debts for a cousin of mine. I got invited into the family. But you're in here. I leaned a little too heavy on the wrong guy, broke his neck in front of a witness. Listen, Man. I'm real close to getting out of here. The warden promised me an early release if I keep playing by his rules. If we're smart, you'd do the same thing. And then me and you, we hook up on the outside. I can always use an extra set of fists to watch my back. Back up, back up. Oh, fuck. Hold on, Man. It's cool. You're gonna be all right. We're gonna get you to the infirmary, all right? Hold on. Put pressure here. Get him to the infirmary, Man! Looks like he's going to the morgue to me. Oh, you bastard. Looks like the boy walked himself into a shiv. I got to tell you guys, I've seen some crazy things happen in this place. Right. I hear that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! No, no! Another time, another place. You heard him, Baby. Another time, another place. Okay. Okay, President. Yeah, Man. Move it, Boy. Move it. I said move. Line 'em up. Let's move! Recess is over! Let's go! I'm untouchable! Can't touch the President. Agent James. Steve, it's Mary. Mary. How are you? I'm good. Um... Sorry. Actually, I'm not really good. Steve, I just can't figure out why and how he got into this huge mess. I don't understand. I went to visit him and I... How was he? He sent me away. He refused to see me again, and he told me it was for my own good. I don't understand, Steve. I don't understand. It's like he became a completely different person. Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm sure he has his reasons. Situations like this, you just got to hang tough, you know? I... No, I know. Listen, I talked to a couple of lawyers. I got some referrals. Why don't you let me look into it? I got some well-situated friends. I might be able to shed some light, okay? Yeah, no, that sounds good. Listen... Don't worry, okay? I'm gonna take care of everything, all right? Burke was my friend. He was my partner. I really appreciate it, Steve. I really do. Anything for you, Mare. You let me know if you hear from Burke again, okay? I will. Thanks. All right. I'll talk to you later. Good evening, Boys. I've been watching you, seeing how hard you've all been training. And as a result, in honor of all your hard work, I have a little surprise in store for you. I give you ladies night! Let's have a hearty welcome for Ilsa and her crew of delectable Hellcats. Whoo! Whoo! Holy moly. Whew. You got to be kidding me. You want some of this? Ooh. Knock her ass out! This is plain torture. Let me frisk her ass! I bet these would look great on you. What the.. Easy, Big Boy. I'm a gift from the Warden. Well... You're quite a specimen. I think I might enjoy this job. What's your name? It's Burke. Okay, Burke. Let's get to it. Um... Oh, my god. Wow. That's... That's amazing. Um... It's... As much as I would love to, I... Oh, my god. I'm one of the married ones. Married, Honey, but you're not buried. Let's be friendly. I can make you feel really good. Ooh. So strong. Come on. Put these arms around me. Oh, shit. I know it's lonely in here. You've got needs. Yeah. Come on. Let me help you forget about them for a while. You know you want me. Okay, okay. You know, as much as I would really love to, I... I-I-I just can't. Like I said. I'm one of the married ones. And I won't. Sorry. What do you want? Enjoy the little gift the warden gave you last night? Hey. You tell the warden, he wants me to continue fighting for him, I need to know my family's okay. You got that? On your feet, O'Reilly. Evening, Ladies. You want some more? You see, today's your lucky day, 'cause The President gonna take his time to kill you. I'm not in a rush. O'reilly, I thought you had a little more heart than that. Is that all you got? Huh? Put it in there! Come on! Put it in there! Beatin' the drum. Like I'm beating your face! Oh, I'll help you up. I got you. You're not having a good day, O'Reilly. Hey, Warden... Let's see if we can get him an early departure. Come on, O'Reilly. Come on. I know you can fight it. Come on. You can fight it. Come on, you son of a bitch, you fight it! Come on! Open the cell doors. Step out and call it out. Watson. Here. Wyatt. Here. Micelli. Here. May. Here. Chow. Here. Pope. Yeah. Farley. Here. Yo, you seen O'Reilly? Yo, you seen O'Reilly, Man? You seen O'Reilly? You won't find him out here, My Friend. Who'd he fight last night? It isn't who he fought in The Pit. It's the Warden who's responsible for all of this. Either way, we're next. Anything new from Burke? All right, well, call me as soon as the next note arrives. Shit. I believe we have some things to discuss, Mr. Burke. Who are you working for? Take him to the hole. Move it. Mr. Wheaton. Sir. I have some great news. Tonight, we are going to have an unexpected death match. Oh, that's thrilling. Yes. Oh, I like it. Yes, I thought you would. Hold his head down. Hold his head. Yeah. To his chest. Go, go. All right, that's enough. Stand him up. How's the water, Mr. Burke? I can hardly wait for your reaction to our next surprise. You're in my world now, Mr. Burke. How'd you find out about the book? I'm sorry, Burke. Warden, can I go now? You can go. All right, that's enough. Let's get on with it. Give him the juice. Come on, Mr. Burke. Can't you feel the electricity in the air? Nothing like electricity to get you ready for your next fight. Give him the juice. Aaaaah! Give him a little more. All right, that's enough. I said that's enough! We don't want him to die here. We want him to die in The Pit. Mr. Burke. What about we bring your family here for a little visit? I can always auction off your wife to the highest bidder on the cell block. How many packs of smokes do you think she'd sell for, hmm? Ooh, and what about your kid? No! You stay away from my family, you sick son of a bitch! Ah, that's it, that's it. Save that for The Pit. Mr. Colson, pick up Tommy and Mary, won't you? No. Yes, Sir. No. I'm gonna kill you, Golan! I'm gonna kill you! You stay away from my family! Steve. Mary, we need to talk. Can I come in? Yeah, sure. Tommy. It's been a long time. You've gotten big. Are you gonna get my dad out of jail? Yes, I am. Sweetie... Can you go to your room for just five minutes? Steve and I need to talk about something kind of important. Thank you. What's going on? Burke's not guilty. It was all a setup. I approached him on behalf of the Bureau to infiltrate Cainesville Prison. What? In order for it to seem real, I had to keep you out of it. Changed his records, set him up to be the perfect convict. Wait a minute. Burke agreed to do this? Why? It's for you. For me? We offered him a large stipend for going in. We promised him a job when he came out. Mary, Burke's a cop. Always has been, always will be. Oh, my god. That's why he didn't want to see me. Now, we've been in communication regularly, but we lost contact the last couple of days. Something's wrong. What are you gonna do? The only thing we can do.. Pull him out. The thing is, If he's been compromised, you guys are in danger. I'm gonna move you guys to a safe house. I want you to pack some things. Please. I'll make some calls. Okay? Please. Tommy? Okay, move! Don't do it! Find the kid now! Even a whisper out of you, and the boy dies. You understand? Hey, Buddy. Let's go for a little ride. No! No! Tell me the good news, Mr. Colson. We have the wife and kid. They're in a holding cell. Any problems? Went like clockwork. You smell like gunpowder, Mr. Colson. Well... There was a little incident that happened, Sir. Well, don't worry, Mr. Colson. These things happen in life. the important thing is how we get past them. Hey, you're gonna burn it. Turn it over. Welcome to Cainesville State Prison, Mr. Wheaton. Love the atmosphere. So primal... And invigorating. Yes, we call it home. This is the main cell block. General living area for rapists, murderers, thieves, and gangsters. Now, if you'll follow me, I have something very special to show you. Here we are. This is the central fighting area. We call it The Pit. It's incredible. Oh, you can feel the violence in the air. You can smell the pain. Now, up here is the observation lounge where we'll have a perfect bird's-eye view of the carnage. It's to die for. I can hardly wait. Warden. Thank you, Mr. Colson. Ah, Mrs. Wyatt. I'm Warden Golan. And you must be Burke Junior. My name's Tommy. Why did you bring us here? This is kidnapping. You're right. That's exactly what it is. And while I'm truly sorry you were brought into all this, rest assured the real blame lies with your husband. He's the one who came in here under false pretenses. He's the one who got you involved. So now as a result, you'll have to share in our next sporting event. You're insane. Not at all. I just happen to enjoy watching men kill each other. Where's the harm in that? Better here on the inside, where it's controlled, than on the outside, where it's not. Don't you think? So let's get down to business, shall we? I hope you're not squeamish at the sight of blood. What's going on here, Golan? I don't like this. Nothing I can't handle, Mr. Wheaton. Remember, you're in this as deep as me. There's no going back now. I know where I'm going. I finish this now. We need every man we got to spare out at Cainesville Prison. Something's going down, and we got to be there. No, listen. Listen, listen. I need more than a couple of backup units. This prison's a fortified armory. Golan's got more shotguns, service revolvers, and rifles than any gang in the city. He's got riot gear and tear gas and a platoon of men that know how to use it, not to mention 300 criminals out for blood. I want every man to know that they have Burke's family. I want everybody out of there safely.. Understood? Look who's come to join us, Mr. Burke. Remember, Gentlemen.. No mercy. Begin. I told you we'd meet again, didn't I? Huh? Now get ready for the pain, Bitch! Is that all you got? You can't hurt The President. This is a long day in hell. Burke. Well, that's it. It's all over. I thought Mr. Burke had more in him than that. It doesn't get any better than this. This my kind of game! I'm gonna sock him up to you, Warden! Get ready to catch him! Maybe we should cut our losses, Sir, call it a night. I'm with him. No. This is a death match. Someone has to die. Those are the rules. Keep the family here, Colson. It's okay. You can't kill me. You can't kill me. I'm The President. Like I told you before.. I didn't vote for you. This is for Lancer. And O'Reilly. You son of a bitch. Aaah! Okay, uh... Death match, Mr. Burke. We play till the end. There will be more blood spilled tonight, even if I have to do it myself. Let's go! This is what it always comes down to, isn't it? You and me. It's what the public wants. The more money they have to spend, the sicker their desires get. Blood, death, sex. It's all there for a price. But Mr. Burke, I've never been in it for the money. No. For me, it's all about this.. two men staring each other down, going at it like gladiators. Up against the wall! Hold it right there! Hands! Right. Spread 'em! You know, I've wanted to do this since the very first day you arrived. Nothing's going to give me greater pleasure than to see you die like a dog. The warden's gonna kill him. Colson! Aah! Federal agent! Get on the floor! I want to clear all these corridors right now! Mary! We're okay. Promise me you'll never do anything like that again. I'll try not to. Great timing, Steve. Hey. You ready to roll? Yes, Sir. Hey, Dad! Hey, Bud. All right. You have a good day. All right, thanks. Good to have you back, Partner. Home at last. Welcome to Cainesville State Prison, New Fish. I'm Warden Malick. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! All right! I'll see you soon! I'll see you soon! Ha ha! We got you now! You don't have to push. I know what I'm doing. Sleep tight, Warden! We're coming for you real soon! It's not bad. Not bad at all.
