What are you waiting in line for? Michael Jackson is coming. Why are you standing here? That question makes no sense. Obviously, to guard the American star. At 17:53, the personal jet of the American star landed at Otopeni Airport in Romania. Michael Jackson stepped out of the airplane at 18:07, and the 10,000 admirers were in for a great disappointment. The star received flowers from 9 year-old twin girls, waved and then left. Allthat in 53 seconds. Michael jackson shot at a stadium in Bucharest a few memorable scenes that will be included in his future video, "Police Walk". Romanian policemen are extatic. Michael Jackson is about to wear a Romanian policeuniform. General Nitu is ordering, "Do not overtakehim". But who can, in fact, overtake Michael Jackson? Around 13:15 Michael jackson was receive by president lon lliescu. Living... living... Good Afternoon. Director, the boys is ready. Whenever. OK, OK. OF SNAILS AND MEN You'll be careful, OK? OK, OK. This vehicle has been our livelihood for years. It was a great achievement of our times. We were the pride ofthis country. We won the Paris-Dakar Rally with it. Aro's prestige is due to all ofyou, who worked hard every day so that the best cars would come out of our production lines. In this democratic transition process that Romania is undergoing, we can see that our sales went down. Actually, this has happened to the entire Romanian economy. - Where the hell were you? - I had something to do. The hell you did. We, the factory management, and the ministry officials decided to take the most drastic measures in order to revive production. Wait... hold on! Our great Emil Cioran said... For those who don't know, this means, "to live eternity is to live day by day." That's what we are going to do, damn it. - You don't care about us! - Look where you brought us! Do you have a better idea? You, with your union. Tell us, here, in front ofeveryone. I have been informed that a French group have made a very interesting proposal. They are coming today to inspect our equipment. Letus welcome them properly. Hey! Shut up! And stop by the cashier for your last paychecks. As oftoday, the factory is being temporarily shut down. Gica... Are we going to let them make fools ofus? I would set his car on fire, justlike that, for eternity. Cutit out, I'm talking now. Eternite au jour le jour, what the hell?! - It doesn'thave any words. - No, butit's a well-known piece. It's Ravel's Bolero. They'resure to recognize it. I assure you, theguests will be impressed. Yes, they will see weshare their culture. Lfthe French don't recognize it, we'll make fools of ourselves. I'm sure they will recognize it. There's no way they won't recognize it. They knowitnot only in France, but all over the world. It is a classic. Whatever you want. It's all the same. As long as we don't make fools of ourselves. Oh well, whatever you want. Goodbye, Director! 10, 20, 25, 26, 27,500. Here you are. Boy, I'd really like to know what that one's like in bed. That one makes squeaky noises. Like a mouse. - And what about that one? - That one... She keeps her eyes closed all the time and breathes hard, like she's sighing. Get out ofhere. You've been with her too? That chick? She's bad, man. She screams loud enough to wake the neighborhood. What would she scream? Good Afternoon! Thank you! - How about this one? - This one, I don't know. - These stay here. - Did you like it? French. Manuela, you knowit's important to make a good impression on these French people. They came all this way. Please, come on. Manuela, you've been making me hot for such a long time. What's the big deal? It could begood for both ofus. Yes. They left the hotel. Yes, bring Mrs. Carmen as well. OK, OK. The Official Day ofthe Car Makers. You're right. Thank you. Sorry! My friends! Welcome! Mr. Director! - Good Afternoon, sir. - My son, Olivier.

But it is beautiful, and we also have beautiful girls. We have a beautiful country. It rains a bit much here. But it is beautiful, and we also have beautiful girls. Of course! - I brought you a small present. - He brought you a small present. This is from our factory in Pontarlier, in Haut-Doubs. That's also a beautiful region... It rains often, just like here. It's from their factory, I don't know where. I've never heard ofthe place. But it's not Paris. Buthe says it rains beautifully there, just like here. So this is our future. Yes, we produce, we produce, we will adapt. Here you can find as many of these as you want After every rain. The manager thanks you, and there are a lot of snails here too. With the rain, you know, snails... - Even better! - You can see on the back there's a recipe. And the secret is a lot of butter and also a lot of parsley and a lot of garlic. Because the snail itself doesn't have a lot offlavor. After 10 minutes in a very hot oven, it's impecable. The secret is to add a lot of butter and garlic, and parsley. Yes, otherwise the snail doesn'thave much flavor. And he's saying it's good. I heard that too, there they pay good money for that. It's a delicacy. Delicacies... international. I'll give them to my wife, see what she can do with them. My wife... my wife cooks. Thedirector's wife is a very good cook. She will cook the snails very, very well. - Shedoes sarmale very, very well. - Sarmale. Yes. I am very glad you came to our small town.

Hey, hey, hey, wait. Why shouldn't we write to him? What's the problem? What the hell is your problem? This guy's right. We're in serious trouble and you're making fun. Write it down, there. What's 150,000 to him? Dinner in a restaurant, right? The tip. He might want to help us, to do a good deed. Half? Yes, the rest Afterwards. As discussed. 150.000 dollars.

Good work! - You smell like perfume. - It's from the French guys. Was it a salary bonus, or what? Those people came because they want to buy us. We'll see how many of us they get rid of and how many will remain. In theend, me and the boys thought the only solution is to write to the Sultan of Brunei. - To help us buy the plant. - Who? The Sultan of Brunei. He's the richest man in the world. Can I write to the Sultan of Brunei? What for? To send me a bicycle. Let him first answer us about the plant. Come on, dinner's ready. And you go wash. You smell like a whore. - French perfume. What do you want? - Really... - I told you the French came to the plant. - Shut up. You can smell them all the way home. You're such a lousy liar. A letter came for you. To hell with them, with their visas and everything. Come on, forget it. You can be happy here too. They're just idiots. Damn stupid! Come on, Mama! Come on, Mama! And please, don't tell me about happiness again. You know, it's not just a dog. It's a noble breed. I don't want a dog in my house. Darling, it's a labrador. Just like Dr. Teianu's dog. Pufi, come on. Pufi, be nice with daddy. Which Teianu? Who's Teianu?

Pufi, stay here. Take him away! How much did it cost? How much did it cost? Drop it. It's not a problem. It's a noble breed. His parents were carefully selected. - They're not stray dogs. - How much did it cost? - Almostnothing. - How much? 15,000. That's not even 50 dollars. - So tell me, isn'tit won'th it? - 50 dollars? Have you gone crazy? What? Didn't you say that we can afford itnow? I did, but we can't afford it yet. Wait at least a week, damn it! Do you think I care about the dog rightnow? Come on, dear, don't argue with him. You're waking up all the neighbors. Mama, why are you not asleep at this hour? Go on, go to sleep. Do you want something to eat? Snails. What's that? Snails. You add butter, garlic and a little parsley. Then put them in the oven for 10 minutes. It says here that the oven must be very hot. You're not going to eat that, are you? What are you saying? You have no idea. This is refined food. I don't want dog in my house. Out! Go on! - Come on, Pufi! - Shoo! Gethim away from me. Let's go, Pufi! Don't be upset. Come with mommy! In the last 3 years, since the wind of freedom started to blow... in our beloved country, our entirelives have changed. Butnow wehavenew problems, new difficulties. Problems we didrt facebefore. As for the factory, our French partner have an interesting program. They will employ around 300 workers for their futurebusiness... You know, sitting here watching TV, that's sure gonna take care of all our problems. Perfect... - Is Viorel asleep? - Yes. How are wegoing to raise our kid if you're unemployed? We can'tlive only on my salary from the shop. I'll find a solution. You will find... Have you been looking? No... I don't know... We'll manage. The hell we will. Don't you see how bad it...? Leave it for now. We won't find a solution atnight. Leave it, leave it, leave it. That's all you ever say. Are you a man full of energy? Are you healthy and under 40? Give a family the gift of hope and get 50 dollars for yourself. Call2305644 or write to us at the Pro Family Foundation, PO Box 31, Bucharest. How much is 50 times 1000 times... 6? Do you think I'm in the mood for math lessons now? Come on, I'm serious now. If you're serious, how come you smelled like perfume when you came home from the plant today? Did you hear me? I'm talking to you. Keep it down, you're waking up the kid. How stupid do you think I am? Were you with that bitch? Tell me! Cut it out! Cut it... Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You're lying to me! Easy! I want you to tell me the truth. I want you to tell me the truth. We can'tlive like this. We have a child to raise. I want you to tell me the truth. I'm telling you the truth... Are you telling me the truth? I'm telling you the truth. Did you cheat on me? No. I understand. No physical flaws, diseases... What did you say? Cronic diseases... Or obesity. I wrote that down. So, you pay 50 dollars for every donation. Yes. Good. Thank you! Bye. Hey, guys! All ofus, together, we can save the plant. I'm telling you... The plant, all thedebts and a license for the engine are won'th 300,000 dollars. If a thousand of us sell our sperm for a week... we collect 300,000 dollars in no time. - What's that we'reselling, again? - Sperm. An American clinic is buying sperm for 50 dollars each. I talked to them and they told me that in onedonation they collect 5 grams ofsperm. This means that 1 gram costs about 10 dollars. The same as a gram of gold. Don't tell me that you aren't able to donate a gram ofsperm. Ifl put my mind to it, I can donate 100 grams a night. Get out ofhere, you're lying. Lfmy wife knewthat I carry such golden bars... If you don't know, shut your mouth! No way, Gica. Who's gonna buy that from us? There's an American clinic in Bucharest. I saw it last night on television. I even called them. 50 dollars, times 1000 men times 6 days is 300,000... dollars. We can even donate a fewtimes a day. We can even offer them a discount and we finish sooner. That's not possible. It's not true. It's true. It says so in the paper. Look! So why should wedo it for the plant? We might as well each do it for ourselves. And what are you going to do with 50 dollars? You eat for a week in a restaurant, or drink itin one night and it's gone, right? Look, if we all pitch in, we can all buy the plant and they can't kick us out of there. Gica, you're crazy. Is this what we do in the union? Stop with the crap, Gica. Stop right there. I suggest we vote. Who's in favor? Come on, guys. We don'thave another solution! What do you mean we don'thave another solution? I don't do such things, I want to stay here in the factory. The French promised us 300 places. - 300? - Yes. Yes? And what about the others? Come on, guys, let's vote! What are we voting for? We're voting to jerk ourselves off? Cut the crap. OK, who is opposed? OK. Who's abstaining? - Come on, guys, it's not like the old times. - George, are you nuts? Don't you understand that we want to stay on at the plant! It's you who are nuts, guys. They won't be able to keep all ofyou on. Most will have to go. Yeah, smartass, but maybe we'll be among those who stay! Yeah, lots ofluck and good bye! You have 10 percent chances, go... Guys, let's try again. Who's in favor? Mirel, come on! I can't. Lfmy wife finds out she'll break my legs. And I don't even think what you'resaying is possible. It is possible. I'll show you that it works. I'll go first. How about Gheorghiu? He's bad off, with 5 kids athome, his wife works part-time... I say keep him. You thought right, he'll be licking our boots. Orghidan. - Gheorghidan? - No. Orghidan. Who's that? Do you knowhim? - I have no idea. - The other column, then. What? They'regoing to what? What? Are they nuts? They madesome calculations and the math is right. It's about 300,000 dollars. How much is the plant won'th? The French are paying 150,000... buthow are they going to get all that money? You know, I myselfsawthe advertisement in the paper. - Showit to me! - Yes. Wait! You'll show me when I get back. I have to go to school. The French are waiting for me.

I'm not ashamed. He's doing his best to keep us off the streets. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but he went a little overboard. Maybe if you tell him, he'll turn around. We have to get along, damn it! Like peopledo. Come on, Viorel! I have to go. Take care. You never know how these things end up. - How are you? - Fine. I'm going home. What are you doing here? I thought you were taking classes in French. Were you being funny? That was hilarious. You knocked me over with thatjoke. I don't think it's funny. What's in thathead of yours? You think you'vegot it made? Planning to go away with that guy, or what? Whatis your problem, really? I thought we had a deal. Now you're playing thedetective with me?

Good marmelade, madam. Thank you. What is hesaying about marmelade? Tell him, dear, that this is jam. You use the whole fruit and it's harder to make. Hesays it's very good, Mama. Leave us alone, OK? I would like to go out with you. Do you want to? - I can't. - Why? Because this is a small town. People talk. It doesn't matter ifthey talk. What would you like to do? I don't know. You can't do much around here. What do you like most? We can do whatever you want... We can go for a walk or eat something. - I like to sing. - Sing? Yes, to sing. There is a karaoke night this week at Club Paradise. - Karaoke? - Yes. Karaoke. Ifl get a proposition, of course. But things are complicated. There are others. I came to get the list with theguys that will be kept for the snail can factory. I want the list with the 300 that will stay on. Did you hear me? Do you want me to get the boys and have a rally? Do you really want a scandal? What rally? With whom? For whom? Gica, there's no one working here anymore. You'd better stick to your business. Make decent money, have a decent family business. Listen, give me that list or I'm calling the newspapers, the TV stations and all. Call them. You still don't get it? This plant will be bought by the French. And you have nothing to do with that? They decide who are hiring. Whoever behaves nicely. Don't do anything stupid. You have a wife and a child to raise. Get somesense into that head ofyours and I'll put you on thatlist. I see hard times ahead, I told you. It's going to get worse. You're screwing us up. Remember what you did during the Revolution? What? You gathered here in front ofthe plant. "Freedom! Freedom!" Well, you got it. You have freedom now. Handle it! Never call me out here again. I know what you want and I'm busy. Wait a second, I have something important to tell you. I've heard that one before. George, I had enough. No, it's not that. I need you. I want you to help me with something. Come on, sit down here for a minute. - What? You knowl like you. - Come on, cut the crap. Stop it! What do you want? Listen, were you there when they signed thedeal? Yes. Can you get me a copy ofthe contract they signed? Why would I getinvolved in this? Well, it's important. I bet they're hiding something. And if we find any proof, or something, we can call the press and have a scandal. Why would I do something like that? You realize thatif they catch me, they will fire me. They're going to fire you anyway if they privatise the plant, aren't they? Maybe they won't. - Oh yeah? - Yeah! So you did what you had to do to stay here. - Aren't you ashamed ofyourself? - Wait, what's wrong? What do you think? I'll slept with you because I liked it, now you think I'd do it with anyone, or what? Manuela, no. No, wait. You know what? Go home and mind your own business. I'm finished with you. Manuela, I didn't want to offend you. What the hell? Sure, you didn't want to offend me. Listen, tell me, have you ever loved me just a little bit? Or was I just someone to screw around with? - Come on... - Say it! Come on, Manuela, what's wrong with you? To hell with all of you! Stupid bastards! Easy, easy, so it stops swelling. And stop fighting with them. Let them say whatever they want. It doesn't matter. It's not your fault. It matters. Good for you, Viorel! I'll go to school and talk to the principal. What's with these punks? They're fighting in school now? Leave the kid alone. Go! Good night, baby. Good night. Good night. Go to sleep! All this is only your fault. You justhad to play hero to save the plant. I'm ashamed to even walk down the street. And now look. The child is suffering because ofyou! - Howis it because of me? - Because ofwho, then? You had to go convincing everybody to act stupid. My God! - Ana! - I think you're losing it! Do you realize if we manage to buy the plant, no one will fire us? You'll be proud of me. We'll have money to go on holiday. Come on, calm down. Really. I'm just trying to do my best to make it better for us. Howcould it be better for us? Howcould it be better when you're off doing this kind ofstuff? Tomorrow you'reselling your sperm to the Americans. Did you think howthat might be like cheating on me? Did you think about that? If you don't get yourself together, I'm taking Viorel and I'm going to my mother's. - Oh, come now, leave it! - Leave it? I'm not leaving it any more! I keptleaving it for years, and where are we? - I'm the butt of everyone's jokes. - There you go again. Actually, you don't care about a thing. How will we raise this child? Will we raise him with what you'regiving to the sperm clinic? Is that what you want? - I just want to... - To what? To save the world? Don't you care about your family at all? Don't you want to save us? Never mind. I'll just save myself. Don't you touch me, or I'll scream and wake the whole building. - You don't smoke, you don't drink. - No, I never liked it. - So you have a child. - Yes, a 9 year-old son, Viorel. Healthy? Yes, except for measles and such, and the flu now and then. What studies do you have? I'm a high school graduate. With a 9, you know. What music do you like? Excuse me? Asinger, a composer you prefer. Bolero, by Ravel. I like it very much. Very good. I'll put it down in your record. It will make a greatimpression. Otherwise your file is... Stand on your feet, please. - What is your height? - 1.80 meters. - Good Afternoon. - Dr. Filip. Good Afternoon. Please, take a seat! I'm a little bit late but I let Otilia help you to complete the forms. How are we? All OK? We went through everything. I think it's alright. I gave you all the information that you requested. Well done. Let's see! It's alright. There's one more thing. From a single donation there are many children, usually 10. Sometimes, when they become adults, some of them want to know who their biological parents are. You understand what I mean. Lfthey wanted, would it be OKfor them to contact you? How's that? I mean, later on, when they're ofage, they might want to know who their biological father is. Will you allow them to contact you? What do you mean by contact me? Sometimes they want to know where they come from. Butit's very rare, I must say. OK, then. So you give them the address and they can knock on my door anytime? No, we'll call you first. Your gesturedoes you proud, sir. You will begiving back hope to a family thatis suffering. On their behalf, I thank you! The nurse will give you everything you need. And... the money? In 2 or 3 days, once we'vedone our tests. Don't worry, the nurse will guide you. - Thank you. - You're welcome! Bye. - Petrescu! - Yes! Come with me. Is everything alright? Excuse me, do you have a magazine or something? My name is Manuela. My name is Manuela. I'm 30 years old. I like you a lot. You like me... a lot? I like you a lot. No, no. French lessons. OK, OK. Do you want to come to France with me? Come to France with me. No, I work at the factory. What are you going to do when they closedown the factory? I work at the factory. No. You can't. Yes, yes. I work at the factory. 300 workers. - You can't. - Why? Because there will be no factory. It will close for good. We will sell all the equipment and that's it. No one needs your factory. They don't care. This place is dead. But you said that 300 workers... It's a lie. No one cares about you people. We won't make snail cans there. We'll sell everything and that's it. But I care about what happens to you. Manuela... Come to France with me. Here you have no future. You came all this way, you lied to us and now you're telling me to go with you to France? Yes, because I tell you the truth. Yes, yes, the truth. - Mama... - Yes. Do you think daddy is OK? Yes, I think so. Do you think he wrote to the Sultan of Brunei? I don't know. Why are you asking? For the bicycle. I don't know... Mama, are you also afraid at night? Come on, enough, go to sleep. Good night! Good night. They want more. The Prime Minister's signature, the Economic Advisor's signature, the Minister ofFinance's signature. It's not that easy. You sell the equipment for a high price... I'm selling it for a high price, but we're partners, we split the profit. Fifty-fifty. Yes, I understand. I have many risks... The workers. Press everywhere. 200... 200. The visit to the foster home was divided in 2 parts. One private, in which Michaelfound out that our kids know how to sing, hereceived a gift from them and generously offered autographs. Then the star went to the kids'playground, built by the Healthe orld Foundation. Michael's love for the children... Hello! Ana, is that you? Ana... I'm sorry! I tried to do something to make things better for us. But... I don't know... I didn't think you would leave over this. Nowl don't know what to do. Is Viorel OK? Ana... come back home! I love you! George, it's me. Listen... be careful. These guys are out to trick you. - What? - They won't take anybody back. This story with 300 peopleis a lie. They're closing the factory and that's it. But how do you know? Somebody told me. Who? Listen, telleveryone. Everybody should know. - Did you sleep well? - Great. I opened the window... Fresh Romanian air. I'm really hungry. Shall we have breakfast? I already ate. Enjoy your meal! Stop pushing. We're registering all of you. Not you, Vasile. Under 45 years, I told you. Ion, put out that cigarette. I told you. You know you're not allowed. Fill in this form here. Starting today, no more drinking, no more smoking, and no touching your wife, understand? - And whatif she wants to...? - Say you have a headache. Come on, play the Bond. Better drop the gun. - Hey, Gica, howdo wedo it? - Howdo wedo what? Tomorrow we meet at the station and leave for Bucharest. - No, man, howdo we do that? - What's that? That... thing... howdo they collectit? They don't collect it themselves, we give it to them. Justlike that? No helping hand? Come on. I'll explain later. See how many people are waiting in line? No shoving! Havesome patience, OK? How are you? Hi! My brother-in-law saw a clinic like that in China, on TV. And they had some nurses helping the men. What, did they show the nurses helping them? No, butl thought that's why they were there. - Do they have nurses at this clinic? - They do. Then let's... You should come, too! But when you were there, did they help you a bit? Come on, I don't need that. OK, whatever. - What do you think about this situation? - The situation is like this. We realized that this way we can get enough money to buy the plant. Pay offthedebts, buy a license for the newengine... and start production again. Until now we have a list with 250, but we hope to have more volunteers. What are your arguments for this initiative and what are your strong points? Well, here in our factory, we have vigorous, strong, smart people. What woman wouldn't want a father like that for her child? We are determined to do this, and please let everybody know. Maybe a convenient solution can be found. Or we'll go to Bucharest... or maybe the clinic will open a department here, in Campulung. Don't you think this might cause trouble back home? Each ofus should decide it within their family. Or maybe individually. But I believe weshouldn't get to this point. To go to such desperate measures. There is no problem. Everything is under control. The French partis settled. But these guys have gone mad. Petrescu from the union, he's getting them to think they can buy the plant. I'll take care ofit! I'll take care ofit. Yes. It's OK. Like... like wesaid. Bye. Miss, I have my husband and my son working here in this factory. I don't agree with that. Go home. This is notnormal. Catalin, why do you...? Go home, you'reembarassing us. You think, just because we're poor, weshould sell just anything? The French are here! I think it's enough for me. I'm out ofhere. Wait a second, what's going on? What's wrong with you? We're almost done. It's good. Everything was solved. We're a team, aren't we? I don't like this game, Dad. It's not fun. I came to help you... That's it. I don't want to live like that. Olivier, this is not the moment. You know you can't save the world. We know that we're in a difficult situation. We will make all efforts to find... It's a business that has to go well. Lfnot, I'm finished. It might be the last one. They will find a way, you'll see. They're used to it. They've always been knee-deep in shit. I haven't. - OK. I understand. - What? Lfyou want to keep her, you have to keep doing business like that. That's easy to see. OK, I'll let you do your business with the parrot. I'm going. Nelu, let go of that cigarette. You'll get sick. Good night! Good night. Are you tired? Are you tired? No, but you knowtomorrow I'm going to Bucharest with theguys. I know, I know... OK, good night. No... stop it! Wait, wait! You know I can't. Wait! Come on, you knowthat. It was spelled out on the goddamn form! Yes, I know, butjust a little. They won't notice it. I can't, don't you understand? Woman, we have to save the plant. What the hell? You don'tlove me anymore! I do love you. But I can't do it tonight. I'm working for export. Good night. I willforget everything I've had The burden I've carried so long, Themoment we said goodbye. I wort ask for theimpossible I wort ask for your love No needto look away Our paths might cross someday Our paths and love, Our thoughts and happiness... Stop eating, man. Stop smoking. I told you. Who's sneaking in the front ofthe line? What's the hurry? - What's for sale here? - Concert tickets. For Michael Jackson, free. - Who? - Michael Jackson. Do you think you've got enough cups for everybody? It's not possible to... We can come tomorrow as well. In smaller groups. Still, we need to hurry because the factory is going to be sold at the end of the month. - Sir, that's not possible. - Why not? Come on, Gical I understand, you know. We're talking large quantities here. Can I make a proposition? Sir... We can give you a discount. Let's say 20 percent. That's enough, sir! This way you only pay 40 dollars per collection. Enough, sir! Wedeal with serious things here. What wedo here determines the lives of children and the happiness offamilies that are now suffering. I don't find your mockery amusing in the least. Our plantis bankrupt, madam. They're privatizing it at the end of the month. And they want to lay us all off. Most oftheguys you see out there have children. Children who want to eat, get dressed, go to school, play... Howcan they do that, madam, if their fathers are unemployed? How? - Stop yelling at me. I can't help you. - Why, doctor, why? The sperm that we buy here, we sell abroad. Wesell it to families that can't have children the natural way. Wesell it to gay women who want to have a child without a man in their lives. These people have a lot ofmoney. Enough money to buy the sperm and also the treatment that's needed. They want to give their children as many chances as possible. Yes, ofcourse. That's why they want to donor to be a tall, handsome, young man... with a high IQ, well-educated and cultured. Let me give you an example. The best seller on the marketnowis the sperm of Danish students. They're tall, handsome, blond. Our clients do not want to buy the sperm of a Romanian worker. Especially notin those quantities. How's that our fault, doctor? We're people, too. I don't know, butl can'thelp you. E wort go, we won't go, Until we save Aro. They say thatit... that it's good for the skin. To keep it fresh. Can't you use the collections for cosmetic products? I don't know ifit's good for the skin, but they don't make skincare products from such things. Go home and mind your business. - You didn't give me the money for last time. - What money? 50 dollars for last time. I already donated. - Yes, yes. What's your name? - Petrescu. - Petrescu? - George Petrescu. George... hold on. Petrescu George. Yes. You donated on the 17th, but we don't owe you anything. Butl donated. Yes, that's true, you donated, but we can't use it. You're sterile. You can'thave children. It's a genetic disease, from birth. It's called the Kleinfelter syndrome. Come on, madam. How is that possible? No, it's nothing serious. You won't die from this, you don'tneed any treatment. Only... that you can'thave children, ever. That's it. Doctor, maybe there was a mix-up with the cups. We're a very serious clinic. Goodbye! What will I do now? I don't know. It's not my problem. Pleaseget your colleagues and go home. Gica! So, Gica, how was it? Are you finished, huh? Come on, don't keep us waiting. Did you donate? How was it? It didn'thurt, did it? Guys, they don't want to collect. What do you mean, they don't want to collect? Why did we come all this way? What, they don'thave enough jars? They don't wanna collect because we're workers. Come on, you scared us. Nowtell us! Come on, we're in a hurry. We can go in 2 or 3 at a time. Hey! Didn't you hear? They're not collecting, damn it! Wait, wait! - Why is that, Gica? Why? - Because we're workers. - They're saying their clients... - ! Uiet! Wait, let's hear what the man has to say. They say... their clients don't want to buy from workers. Who do they want to buy from? From educated people, students, doctors. Shut up, man!! Uiet! - What the hell's wrong with ours? - They say it's not the same. Why don't you wanna collect from us? What's wrong with us? Cut it out! Have we got the plague or something? Go away, move it! I made a fool ofmyself, got the wife all pissed at me... Police! Call the police! The sperm of Danish students, you say? Yes, that's what the doctor said. Well ifl'd known, I should have dyed my hair blond. We should have gone to Michael's concert. What will I tell my wife now? Sunburned, beaten by the police... And no fucking money to show for it. We'll be their laughing stock back home. He'll laugh in our face. "You made fools ofyourselves in Bucharest." "I'm going to fire all of you." - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Yeah, nothing. Tell me what's wrong? What am I going to tell Viorel now? He really wants a bicycle. I wanted to gethim one with the money from my last donation. And they didn't give you anything? Take it! - No. - Take it! Lon... Come on, or we'll miss our train. Our paths might cross someday. Our paths and love, Our thoughts and happiness. - Cheers! - Cheers! Manuela... I have a surprise for you. Likenight, like dreams Are theblack eyes of my love Manuela Like ear of wheat in spring Like fullmoon is my love Manuela Her loving words, The restless look of my love Manuela You havemy senses imprisoned, And allmy dreams ar for Manuela Since it came into my life Since that afternoon when lmet Manuela. I'm happy likeno oneis, Because every day is witing for me The sweetness of her kisses, And that immense love that Manuela gives to me. We'll manage somehow. Are you working for export tonight, or do you have some for the internal market? What's up, George? Did you get a package? Still saving the plant? Daddy! It's daddy! How are you? Come on, run! Run, run, it's raining! - What's that? The bicycle? - Yes. - Is it from the Sultan of Brunei? - No, it's from me. Tonight, I'm the Sultan of Brunei. I told you, Mommy! I told you daddy would bring me a bicycle. - Yes. - Look! - Look, it has a horn too. - Go, go! There you go. Well done! I found this bicycle in Bucharest. - How was it? - It was OK. Listen... you know what they told me at the clinic? They told me I can'thave children. They told me I have a syndrome... I can't remember... Something with a German name. You know what I did? I broke their windows. Howcould they say that? Viorel's got my eyes, doesn't he? Yes, he has your eyes. Get him out ofthe rain, so he won't catch a cold. Look, Cucu, there's one To your right. Look over there. Get him, he's running away! - Careful. That one's going for export. - Look how fat this one is! Lon, do you think Manuela's French guy is really taking the snails to France? Yes, hesays so. He's paying one dollar per kilogram. So you're going to Paris? Lucky bastard... To live on a footing with eternity is to live from day to day. Emil Cioran - Romanian philosopher At 16:02, the inevitable did happen. Michael Jacksors personal jet took off for Istanbul, his next stop on the Dangerous tour. To his list on conquests, Michael Jackson can now add his Romanian fans. He left... and I'm sure he's never coming back!
