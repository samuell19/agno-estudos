Morning. Right on time. As always. Seems some things never change. Thanks for seeing me, Jaffy, I appreciate this. Well, you did seem pressed on the phone. What seems to be the trouble anyway? Well, there's no other way to put this. I need you to dust off your private investigator hat and get back to work. Alfred, Alfred, Alfred. It's for a dear friend. Aren't they all? No, no, this ones special, really. I need your help. Well, you know I stopped doing that line of work a ling time ago. And for good reason. Look at me, look at me, Jaffy. I can't do this work anymore, not with this crook leg. All right. Well, what's the money like on this one? Is it good? Yeah, it's not bad. Pretty good. Better than normal. And lets face it, you could do with it right now, yeah? All right, you bastard, you got me. But this will be my last time, I can promise you that. Aye aye, Captain. Oh God, I hope I don't live to regret this one. What's wrong? Nothing, I just got a lot on my mind right now. Such as? I saw Alfred this morning. Seriously? And? And he's offered me another assignment. You're kidding. We finally get some quality time together and what? You're bailing on me? Well, I need the money right. Money isn't everything, Jaffy. No, the more I think about it, this is ridiculous. Sorry. You're a workaholic, you know that? And you're, doesn't matter. And I'm what? Go on say it. You don't like me anymore? No, I like your face. It's just your personality that shits me. So it seems Alfred's convinced you to go back to work. Did I have a choice? Well, I don't need to tell you what you already know. Any upgrades on this one? Pretty standard kit. Contains a stills camera, zoom lens, binoculars, and mini tracking device, which you can plant in a car or someones bag. Charge the battery for four hours. That will give you about five days usage, roughly. Okie-dokie. Obviously if you obtain the clients mobile number, you can track 'em. Yeah, of course. Anything else? A lot of the guys now are using covert cameras and monopods, so you might want to consider investing. You might wanna take this. A torch? Really. What the hell do I need this for? In case someone wants to play murder in the dark. Thought about buying a new suit? Doors closing. Tell me, what is it like to be colour blind? Well, I see the world in a different way, I guess, my own way. You're the detective? Private detective, yeah. But lets not say that too loudly, in case we want the investigation to stay private. Come in, won't you? Thanks. Have a seat. Sure. I'm sorry, have I interrupted you or something? Do you need to change. Oh, um, look I just had a shower, I can change later. Whatever makes you comfortable. So, Jaffer was it? No, Jaffy. Jaffy. Ah, is it all right if I call you by your first name? Lets keep it to Mr. Rotunda. You are, after all, my client. Oh, well Alfred was right about you then. I'm glad. You know, between you and I, I'm sick of every guy trying to get into my pants right now. So this is a nice change. Okay. So what do I call you then? Call me Trix. Trix? Trix. With an X. Your parents were original. I didn't get it from my parents. A drink. Water's fine. All right. H2O coming right up. Thank you. You know, you can call me Ms. Baxter. Okay, Ms. Baxter. What exactly do you need from me? How long have you been in this line of work? Long enough, too long perhaps. But you're good, right? I mean I'm going to be paying you a lot of money. I deliver a service worth more than the amount. What do you mean by that? Well, I mean I take the work personally. Personally, or professionally? Professionally of course, but I'm passionate about the work. I don't finish a job until it's done properly. And how do you know when that is? When you're standing there in less than your night gown and I can call you by your first name. Okay, you're good. Listen, I am sorry for coming across so causally about all of this. But, I'm kind of a little bit messed up right now. Well, if you don't mind me saying so, you seem perfectly fine to me. Look, it's not about me, it's my sister who needs help. So you're concerned for your sisters well being. Yes, I am crazy right now because my sister is not good. Okay, well lets try to change that, I mean do you need me to tail her or, what exactly is wrong with her? Damn, this is hard. Okay, no no lets go slow, I'm not in a rush. I'm here for hire to help you, so lets take it as it comes. I don't trust her right now. No? No. She's, I mean I can't look after her all the time because I have my own work to do and she needs someone to follow her. She needs an eye on her full time. You guys live together? Sometimes. But I mean she's out there doing God knows what and I am sick of stressing over her. I can't live like this. I'm trying to understand your situation more clearly. Are you saying she's a walking time bomb or something? What's your sisters name? Her name is Sia. Hey, hey, what are you doing? Sorry, I was just... It's a big drop, be careful. Why is it that you do the work you do? What do you mean? Well, it's just that I've noticed you seem to follow and investigate the lives of others. But you don't seem to perhaps work on yourself more. Is it just that you're bored or do you have something to hide? Yes, may I help you? I'm here to see Mrs. Baxter. And your name? Mr. X. Oh yes, Mr. X, we've been expecting you. Please come this way. I've been expecting you. Mrs. Baxter? Please, sit down. Thank you. Lovely place you have here. I get by. Seems you get a little more than just that. Hard work, Mr. X. That's all there is to it. That's refreshing to hear. Most of the wealthy people I've met have been born into the right family. Wow, that sounds so judgemental. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. It's just that's been my experience. Do you have children, Mr. X? No. Why is that? Sorry, I don't mean to pry. Cigarette? I used to smoke. Truth is I miss it from time to time. Especially when I'm drinking. In fact, I miss drinking too. Will power. I'm impressed. Married, Mr. X? No. So, I take it you've done this kind of thing before? Ha, have I done this kind of thing before? You could say that. I don't need to know the details. No, that's all right. My husband. The bastard. Or perhaps I shouldn't say that about my ex. Were you close? Once. Are you in contact? I'd rather not talk about it. Painful memories, you understand. Yeah. So where were we? We were getting to know each other. What does the X stand for? Ah, it's nothing really, it's the same as saying John Doe. Mmm. So I take it you've called me here because you want to speak with me about your daughter. I have two daughters, Mr. X. The eldest is a little know it all, she thinks that she controls everything. She is not to be trusted. All right. All of this is mine, I worked very hard for this. I'm sorry I'm a bit confused. Which assignment am I on? And concerning which of your daughters? Sia. The one who needs it the most. We've had a very hard year. And I'm frightened of what she might do. Just so you know, you'll be reporting only to me on this matter. And my contract and the monies I receive? Don't worry, Mr. X, I'll be arranging everything. Okay, excellent. You sure you won't have a cigarette now? No, no thanks I'll be okay, thank you. Suit yourself. May I ask you a personal question? I guess so, why not? What do you do to relax? Well, I would say you're a sight for sore eyes, but I've been following your sister. Oh, so you like the view, do you? There's nothing wrong with the Baxter girls. Well, that's what I'm paying you to find out. Noted. Follow me. So what have you got? Yes. So, here is your sister. Oh my God. What is she doing? Hmm? Here, what's happening? Oh, that's nothing. Nothing? It looks like she's about to jump! Oh, no, no, no. Really, that was nothing. I was there. Nothing happened. This is exactly what I'm talking about, Mr. Rotunda, this is what we have to be so careful of. This is why I hired you. Okay, I understand. Excuse me a moment please. Of course. Thank you. So, where were we? Anymore photos? Yes. So here we are. Oh, that's him. This man, why would she... This guy? Yeah, I can't believe she would visit him? Yes, ah, why would she go visit him? You know him? Ah, he's the man from the accident. Accident? You've done well, Jaffy, thank you. Well, that's great. I'm glad I've helped somewhat. What I need you to do now, is get back to work. But what about the old guy? You don't worry about him. It's fine. You know, just keep doing what you're doing. You're good, I'll give you that. Okay. You gotta be kidding me. Fancy meeting you here. Mr. Rotunda. Mr. Xylophone. What on earth are yo doing here? Oh, wait a second. By the way you're dressed, I'd say you were on the job. I could say the same thing about you. I thought you'd retired. Sort of, I'm working on another one, my last, I hope. So you are working then? Yeah, but I can't tel you that. I can't believe I'm standing here in front of you. I'd heard a rumour you were dead. Chinese whispers, my old friend. Old friend, next you'll be calling me counsellor. Nah, they only call people that in American movies. So what should we refer to each other as then? Not a word I use often. It's not proper. Try me. Cunt. Hold on a sec. Maybe we should get a drink? Maybe next time. Shake on it. Good to see you, mate. - Hello. - Hi. Are you looking for something in particular today? Um, no I think I've found what I'm looking for. Okay. Thanks. God, I love this piece. It follows me everywhere, I've seen it like five times now. I'm sorry, are you talking to me? If you'll listen. Wait a minute, do I know you? Would you like to? Seriously, have I seen you before? Jaffy. Sia. Do you like this piece? Yes, of course, its a classic. I don't think people appreciate art the way they used to. What do you mean? You know, it's like kids of today would probably rather go into Google images and have a look rather than come down to an actual gallery. Do you know what I mean? That's a good point. It's like some men don't know how to talk to the opposite sex without treating them like a sex object. Is that a line? Not bad, huh? So bad, I'm sorry. Wow. Wow, what? You've got a beautiful smile. Sorry, sorry, you're probably sick of hearing that, right? Actually no, not lately. Not lately? What, you're single? Amazing. Well, look before some other guy comes and snatches up the opportunity, would you allow me to take you out for coffee? Sure, why not? I don't have anything else on right now, so... Excellent. Okay, lets go, I know a place. For Christ's sake, Jaffy, leave the important stuff to the real cops, will you? You guys aren't cut out for this side of things. You private dicks, I swear to Christ. Fuck! Welcome back, Mr. X. This jobs turning into a nightmare. Isn't that what I pay you for? Indeed. What have you got for me? What am I looking at? It seems that Sia has a new man friend. Man friend. What do you mean man friend? If my daughter had a new man friend, I can assure you that I would be the first to know. Okay. So who the hell is it? I kinda know the guy. You kinda know the guy? It's complicated. And? His name's Jaffy. We trained together, we worked together, we went to the same academy. Go on. He's a private investigator. Are you telling me that my daughter has hired a private investigator while she's being tracked by one? I don't think we can underestimate the seriousness of this situation. What is that supposed to mean? What it means is, is that wherever this guy goes, whatever he does, has purpose. It means that this guy's dangerous, he is unethical, he'll stop at nothing to get what he wants and your daughter is in over her head. Well, if he's a danger to my daughter then I want him removed form the picture as soon as possible. Removed? How? Isn't that what you do for a living? You deal with it. I'm a private investigator. I investigate things. I'm not a hitman. I'm not asking you to put a hit out on him. I just want you to scare him a little. I don't do that kind of thing. Well, I guess I'll just have to do it myself. Yes, I don't want any part of it. That concludes our business then, Mr. X. You know the way out. You know how to pay me. Now tell me a little bit about the history between you and Mr. X. Why so bleak? We were assigned to the same job together, one in which I stuffed up. Stuffed up? What do you mean, in what way? One of the clients killed himself. And X never forgave me. And do you somehow feel that this a direct result of a fault of yours or, do you feel guilty for this? Yeah, kind of, indirectly. I mean I guess if you had to blame someone then it would fall on me. So, do you think it's true when they say it's easier to open up to a stranger? Certainly feels that way at the moment. I mean like when you don't know somebody you're kind of free to be whoever you want to be. That's right. No judgement, no preconceptions, no expectations. You know, I think as a species we're selfish. You know we're, we compartmentalise everybody, we put people in a box to make ourselves feel better about our own insecurities. But the truth is, in life you can't control everything. You gotta ride with it. Do you mean to be open to the new that comes our way and not to fight every single thing? Is that what you mean? You know what, you're really awesome, Sia. When I saw your picture, I thought for sure that you were self conceited and pretentious, but no, you're not. Saw my picture? Yeah, on the billboard. You're a model, right? Oh my God, you saw that. I forgot about that. To be honest, my mind has been elsewhere lately. Why is that? Um. What's on your mind? Well, it's pretty bad, like just some bad stuff happened. Really? What happened? Um, my younger sister, she killed herself. God. She um, Hope she did. That's terrible. You know the worst part is the guy driving the car survived and now he's probably more messed up than what she was. Do we know why she jumped? My parents won't admit it but I know why. She was mentally ill, she always was. I always knew that she was. You know, the worst is that my mother is the kind of person, who like the last person to admit her faults. There's like too much of this image to uphold in our family unfortunately, so... Family. Yeah. Thanks for listening. I think I need to talk more. I just completely closed myself up, so it feels nice. It's okay, no worries. You know there's really nothing wrong with you, Sia. We've all got our own grieving process. It's different for everybody. Thank you, you're sweet. Sia. What? Stop talking. Hang on a second. Sia wait, wait, I gotta tell you something. What? Hang on a second, wait. What? I've got a confession to make. What's going on? It's kinda messed up. I don't know how you're going to take this. What did you do? It's not what I did, it's who I am. I'm a, I'm a friggin'... You're what? I'm a private investigator hired to follow you. You're joking. I wish I was. But rest assured your family just want to know that you're okay. But, um... This is so messed up. My feelings for you are real though. You've been following me. Now I know why you felt so familiar. We can work this out though, yeah? Work what out? I don't even know you! You're just a guy who tried to pick me up! No, I'm more than that. Yeah, you're the creepy private investigator hired to follow me. Fuck you. Sia, wait. Was there a woman involved in this one then? I am beginning to see a pattern here, Jaffy. Alfred? Al, are you there? I need to talk. Jaffy, is that you? What's up? How's the case going? Jaffy, are you there? Yeah, sorry. I think things have got messed up. What do you mean? Are you okay? Do you need me to come down? No, it's okay, it's nothing like that. Well, thank God for that. So what happened? It's this girl. Which one? Baxter? Oh, you didn't fall for Trix did you? No, it's not Trix. I didn't fall for Trix. It's not her, it's her sister. She's different. I've never met anybody like her. I've got feelings for her. Jaffy, listen to what you're saying. It's a client. You can't think that way about her, about any of them. And besides they're a wealthy family, you'll never equate to them, my friend. I'm sorry to say it, but that's the truth. It'll never work. I don't think she cares about the money. Oh, she's female. Of course she cares about money. Get over it. Go to sleep, you sound exhausted. Let it go, chief. Ah, man. Seriously, get back on the programme. Call me tomorrow after you've had a rest. It'll sort itself out. Trust me, it always does. I think I've made a mistake. You what? Jaffy? Jaffy, you there? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Sorry, I think I better get some sleep. Okay. Good. Morning. Lovely day. Right on time. Excuse me, mate, you haven't seen a black dog come through here by any chance, have you? No, sorry, mate, I haven't. Are you sure? She was just here a minute ago. Really? No. I don't think so. Just. Stay the fuck away from Sia and the Baxter family. This is your first and last warning mate. Stick to the small stuff, Jaffer. Are you all right? Oh God, what happened to you? Help, please. You look pretty bad. I don't think I should move you. I think I should call an ambulance. No, no, no ambulance. I just, ah. God, I really don't think you should move. Can you just help me get to my car, it's over there. Your car? That's all I ask. Just help me to my car please. I'm gonna do an X-Ray and a CT scan just to make sure you haven't fractured any bones in your head. So you say this guy came from nowhere and jumped you? Yep. Well, you better report it to the police because he's done some serious damage to your body. How long is it going to take for my eye to heal? Well, you need rest. Now you're gonna have to apply ice to that. 20 minutes every hour for the first 24 hours. Okay, and avoid touching the area. Okay, as for those ribs, it's gonna take three to six weeks to heal completely. You're probably gonna experience a bit of discomfort, shallow breathing, but that's all normal. Is there anything I can take for that? Normal paracetamol is fine, but I'll give you a brochure on the way out so you know how to take care of yourself for this type of injury, okay? Okay, thanks. And Jaffy, go to the Police, will you? Don't let this scumbag get away with what he's done. Sia? Where on Earth have you been? Darling, it's so good to see you. Mother, how could you? How could I what? You know exactly what I'm talking about. I just can't believe it? Don't be angry. It was for your own good. For my own good? You've broken every level of trust I could ever have for you. Did you ever think to just ask me yourself? No! Instead you hired a private investigator to track me, and for what? What exactly do you think is going on in my life? Have you stooped that low mother, really? Have you lost yourself that much you can't even trust your own daughter's anymore. Or should I say the only one you have left. I'm sorry darling, I, it's just that you pushed me too far! I'm done. Where are you going? Far away from here. You can't keep running. Goodbye, mother. Look, I didn't say you looked like your Mom, but she is hot. Look, I gotta go, I'm at a buddies. Jaffy, you home? Come in, it's open. Yeah, I noticed. Oh, Jesus! What happened? That looks really nasty. I'm over it. No seriously, firstly who did this? Secondly, do I need to do anything about it? Okay, this one's over my head, we're gonna let it go. Seriously? Because I can even the playing field really easy. No, I appreciate that, man. Thanks, but not this time. I mean, it's surprising. You don't usually let people slide. Okay. What's funny? You actually kinda look like the guy. Great. And now you're going out? I've got some very important business to finish. I need to ask you a favour. Yeah, name it. I could be little bit paranoid but I need you to watch the house until I get back. Done. Is that cool? Can I sleep on the couch? Hey. Hey, are you all right? I don't think you should be driving with that eye. Thanks for the concern, but I'm okay. Sia! Sia, Sia. Sia, Sia, wait. Jaffy, what on earth are you doing here? You can't still be following me, and what happened to you? I didn't follow you. I mean I chased you here but not as a PI. Wait, I'm so confused right now. What do you need to tell me that's so urgent, okay, because I'm leaving, I need to go. No one can stop me, not even you. I know but I just I need you to forgive me. Look at me, I've paid for my sins, right? Okay, okay. Okay, yes, I forgive you. I have to go, I really have to go, I'm sorry. Sia, wait. Did I ever tell you that I was colorblind? No, I don't think so, but what does that have to do with anything? I never told you that I was colorblind but when we were hanging out, a couple of times, you're not going to believe this, I saw you in complete and perfect colour, as I do now. That's why I have to know you. It's a miracle. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Jaffy. I can't, I can't. Mr. Baxter? Yes? And you are? I'm Jaffy, my name's Mr. Rotunda. I'm the private investigator that you hired. Oh yes, Mr. Rotunda, I know who you are now. I think I know what you're here for. Will you wait here a moment please? That outta do it. This concludes our business. We no longer require anymore of your services, thank you. Mr. Baxter, can I just ask you one question? Mr. Rotunda, let me just say one thing. The Baxter women are intolerable. I'm sorry for your trouble. Have a good day now, won't you? Honestly darling, I don't know how you put up with this. And shame on Malcolm for leaving like this. He's done it before. And what about Trix? Have you heard anything from her? No, and we're not speaking to each other either. Oh this is too much. Louise, do you mind if we don't talk about that right now. Yeah, you're right. So, what about that private investigator you were talking about? What about him? A bit handsome you were saying. He's so not my type. And why not? He's a pussycat. You know me, I like them big and strong. Yeah, that's true. Well, it's good to see you getting out. We all need a little pampering from time to time. Thank you, Louise. You're such a good friend. Darling, just one more question and I promise then I won't ask anything. About Sia. What about Sia? Do you think she'll be coming back or is she gone for good this time? That's a good question, Louise. It's a very good question. I honestly don't know. Okay, you have been seeing this girl for quite a long while. Did you develop feelings for her over a period of time? Mmm, no, a short time. But long enough to fall for her. Hey X, are you there? It's Jaffy. What can I do for you Rotunda? Well, to be honest, I was wondering if you still wanted to go out and get that drink? What's the matter, did you lose one, did you? Jaff? Jaffy? For a second there I didn't know who it was. My God, you look like you've been through hell. Yeah, something like that. Sit down. Crook knee is it? Sort of, it's the broken rib that's giving me more trouble than anything else. Jesus. Couple of peas in a pod now, aren't we, Alfred? I don't know what to say. So, the job's finished? Oh yeah, it's finished all right. And on a professional and personal level, this would have to be the worst one to date. Just so you know. Jaffy, I'm sorry to hear that. But the money's all right, isn't it? You never stop. So, if I was to tell you that we had a new client, you probably wouldn't be interested. Take a good look at me, friend. This is exactly why I didn't want to go back into private investigation in the first place. No, thanks, but I'm done. So where are you going? To lick my wounds. You'll be back. You know where to find me. I have no idea where the moon is actually going now. Are you even listening to me? I love this girl. Whatever. How you holding up? You okay? Not great, man. You really had it for this girl, didn't you? Big time, can't stop thinking about her. And that's it, she's totally gone? No chance, just disappeared. I've checked everywhere, I've retraced all my steps, I've double checked. She's gone, she's not coming back. Fuck, that's harsh. Nightmare. Well, look, homey, you gotta move on. We gotta do something to get you past this. So you got any ideas? Well, I'm cut pretty deep, but yeah going to have to do something to get over this one. Something, something. We could audition for porn stars. So tell me what's so special about this girl, as opposed to all the others? When she's around there are moments when I see her what I believe to be perfect colour. Do you mean your visions changed? Kind of, it's like there are more colours around, more than normal. Wow, that sounds miraculous. Yes, she is kind of a miracle, Sia. Nice to see you. Alfred, Alfred, Alfred, Alfred, Alfred. What can I do for you, X? First you can tell me what you were doing assigning me to the Baxter case. What on earth do you mean? You must have known the Baxter's were a bunch of psychos. Two separate members from the same family, hire two separate investigators for the same job. It's absurd, Alfred. Maybe it is, but its a paid job isn't it. Perhaps, but you knew about it. Yes, maybe, but it's a client. God knows we can all do with the money. And you knew about Jaffy too, didn't you? You assigned him to the same case. Maybe I did and maybe I didn't. Besides what's it got to do with you? You dog. Regardless, which you two have got some big issues to sort out, all right. It's a mess, mate. Oh look, X, people with money, they do strange things. Desperate, competitive, split, desperate families. What do I know? So, what be the lesson, X? I don't know, that I can forgive, but I won't forget. Touche. Good afternoon. Thank you for calling California Club. This is Trudy, how can I help you? No funny business tonight, no? No. Good. I'll bring the girls in then. What's the rates? It's 240 for half hour, 330 for the full. Thanks. Hi, baby. My name is Candy. Why are you so sad? Maybe I'll just do a little twirl for you. Like that? I'll give you a kiss, oh sweet little darling. Hang on, hang on a sec. What? You're gorgeous, don't get me wrong, but I'm looking for a specific girl tonight. Whatever, you don't know what you're missing, whatever. Can you go slower? Okay. Are you okay? Yeah, you're a knockout, don't get me wrong. Sure. But tonight I'm looking for a certain girl. That's okay, I understand, maybe next time. Hi, how are you? Okay. Are you okay? Yeah. That's good. What happened to your eye? Got into a fight. Oh that's no good, poor thing. Let me kiss it better for you. Sweet. By the way, I'm Mercedes. Do you mind if I call you Sia? No, not at all. I can be whoever you want me to be. Tell me, how are you going to cope, now that she's gone? Well, she has my number. I just hope and pray that one day maybe she'll call me. And that she realises that my feelings and attraction towards her was real. Sia?
