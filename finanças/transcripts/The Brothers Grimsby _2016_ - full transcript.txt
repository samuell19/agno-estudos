You're a total fucking weirdo, right? - Just stay in here... - Mm-hm. ...and do not come out. Okay- [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [IMITATING CONNERY] So we meet again. Please, come in. Okay- What are you doing? Let someone else do that. [CLATTERING] Please excuse me for one moment. [WHISPERING] What the hell are you doing? I'm getting myself ready. Shh. Listen, I get it. You don't wanna get any brown shrapnel on your clothes. Brown-- Brown shrapnel? This. You see? Hard, soft, hard. [IN NORMAL VOICE] May the best man win. BANU: I go in there now. NOBBY [IMITATING CONNERY]: No, no. Let's get acquainted. Has anyone ever told you... ...that you're a very beautiful woman? You are the most beautiful thing to ever walk the Lord's green earth. [BEEPING] We're getting signal from Graves' lens, sir. Put it up. So, what are we looking at? Good God, Graves. [BANU SQUEALS] Why did Lukashenko meet your husband? Can you zoom in on that stationery? Send the coordinates to Chilcott. You'd rather make love to a maid than me? NOBBY [IN NORMAL VOICE]: Maid? Banu, out'. - Sorry, Mrs. Smit. - Mrs. Smit? Get out, Banu. I'm so sorry. Sorry. [DOOR CLOSES] Now, let me show you how wild this animal can be. Did you really think I'd let you sleep with my wife, Mr. Graves? No. But then again, I never thought that she'd chop up me poo with a hanger. Goodbye, Sebastian Graves. SEBASTIAN: That's not Sebastian Graves. - You okay? NOBBY: Yeah. How was the heroin? Better than expected. Why did Lukashenko meet your husband? - What are Maelstrom planning? - I don't know. Seb, don't. Listen. Don't take it personal, love. He kills everyone. It's because he used to wet the bed. -It's important she knows. -It's not important. Was important to the boy on the bunk under you... -...who used to get dripped on at night. - Get on with it. Just tell us what you know, and he'll let you live. Come on. Lukashenko bought some kind of virus. When is he gonna use it? Tomorrow. Where are they gonna release the virus? They'll release it-- [GUNFIRE] SEBASTIAN: Get down. Stay down. [POWERING UP] It's Chilcott. Move! Come on! Come on. Run. - There's nowhere to hide. -lgotanidea. Great. Because your ideas have netted nothing but gold up to this point. You're gonna follow me and do exactly what your big brother says. - Hurry! - Come on. Where did they go? - They were just here. - Spread out. Find them. - Unh! - Oh, God, this is disgusting. MAN: Sir, take a look at this! SEBASTIAN: Check if they've gone. NOBBY: I'm trying to. Unh! SEBASTIAN: What can you see? - They've gone? - The coast is clear. Good. Let's get out of here. Oh, no. Oh, fuck me. Brace yourself, Seb. - God. - Get off of him. SEBASTIAN: Get it off me. NOBBY: Aah. The male can fuck for up to three hours. We have to make it come. I saw it on the BBC. You work the shaft, and I'll cradle the balls. It's gonna break my neck. I got them. Come on, Sebbo. You can do it. I'm doing it, I'm doing it. - Put your tongue in the peehole. - Don't be stupid. I think we're in business. I think we're in business. Come on. Come on. [ROARS] Oh, God. That is revolting! Hakuna matata. Well done. I think I'm gonna be sick. It's a trickle of pre-ejaculate at most. Grow up. See if the coast is clear. [ELEPHANT TRUMPETS] - Oh, no. - What? What is it? It's an elephant bukkake party. - Get it out. -It's breaking me asshole. Not much longer now. - Brace yourself! - No. Aah! [ROARING AND TRUMPETING] SEBASTIAN: All right. Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. - I just did an entirely white poo. - You need to get cleaned up. Get in. - Is me ass okay? - Huh? Yeah, it's good. It's really good. [GRUNTS] Are those your bollocks? Heh. Someone's given you a hickey on your right nut. Ha-ha-ha. That was you. Oh. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] It's Jodie. - She could be your missus. - I could never be with one woman. Well, you're missing out on the greatest gift in life: Family. The only gift I ever got from my family was betrayal. Why did you do it? - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter? You abandoned me when I was 6. Now, why? MR. GRAVES: We have made our decision. We've decided we can take one of the brothers, Mr. Lowsley. But Mr. and Mrs. Graves, these boys are inseparable. It would break their hearts, and affect them both very badly. This is the decision we have come to. MR. LOWSLEY: But that would leave one brother in the foster system in Grimsby. It's no place for a boy. He'll have no future here. CONDUCTOR: All aboard! YOUNG SEBASTIAN: Nobby! Have you seen me brother Nobby? Nobby! No! Nobby! - Come back, Nobby! -[VOICE BREAKING] No. Oh, my God. - So I could have had your life? - That's right. And you could have had mine. Nobby. [SEBASTIAN SIGHS] .1111 I am so sorry. Wait. I think our penises just fist-bumped. Disengage. - You need to focus, right? - Yeah. You need to find out where Maelstrom are planning to blow up tomorrow. And I need to find a pub to watch the final in. - Hold on. That's it. - They're gonna blow up the sun. No, they're planning to bomb the final in Chile. - What? - How are we supposed to get halfway... ...around the world in 12 hours with the global intelligence community... ...trying to kill me? We'll never make it. I searched for you for 28 years. I do not believe in never. That's the beauty of Linkedln. Hey, Nobb-Man. How's your brother going to blend in with football hooligans? Looking like the guy from Despicable Me? [NOBBY & TABANSI LAUGHING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] CROWD: England! England! MAN 1: English and German fans have been arriving here in Santiago... -...throughout the last few days. MAN 2: Looks like the perfect place... ...to watch your national team play for what is the greatest prize in football. - This is a truly international occasion. MAN 1: We've seen Donald Trump. Star of stage and screen, Daniel Radcliffe is here. Middle East peace symbol Schlomo Khalidi... ...looking much better, is here too. So much color and noise. And there will be plenty of both at the end of the match... ...because the final whistle will trigger what we are told will be... ...the biggest firework display ever seen at a sporting event. When we was kids... ...did you ever think that we'd end up going to the final together? Yes, I did, brother. MILKY: Nobby! [ALL CHEERING] - No. - Surprise! I missed you so much. Hey. Our favorite spy! ALL [CHANTING]: He's Ml6's finest! - He's Ml6's finest! SEBASTIAN: No. No. Keep quiet. MILKY: Nothing to see! [ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: There's a commotion, sir. Get in closer. LEDFORD: Graves. Yeah. - Nobby. - Hey. I'll be back. Coddy! Wait. Nobby! Wait. Nobby! [ALL GRUNTING] [YELLS] Let's go. NOBBY: Sebbo? Sebbo? Sebbo! Oi! Seb. Got you. [WOMEN & MEN GRUNTING AND YELLING IN DISTANCE] What is this place? Oh, my God. Maelstrom are sex traffickers. Listen to me. You've gotta get out... ...before they sell you to the highest bidder. Get out. Get out now. Out. Out. Shh. Quiet. You don't have to live like this. Get out. Out. Get out. Regain your dignity. Out. [SHRIEKING] [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Seb. "The rapist." H9)'- Nobody buggers me brother. A man can only take so much jizz. - Get off him! - Aah! [YELLING] [HAIR RIPS THEN MAN SCREAMS] Wait. You're not Seb. [SHOUTS IN SPANISH] [BOTH GRUNTING] [RHONDA SHIVERS] You must be freezing. You. Pleasure to meet you, Sebastian. I understand why you want to kill the head of the World Health Organization. Why bomb the final? Bomb? There is no bomb. It's a disease. It's a virus called RD-9. Or as I like to call it, WorldCure. At the end of the game, everyone in the stadium will be infected. It should take two to three weeks for symptoms to start showing up. SEBASTIAN: By which time, 96,000 fans from almost every country in the world... ...will be back home, spreading the disease. Why are you doing this? RHONDA: Well, think about it. We have seven billion people running around on a planet... ...that can only hold five. I'm just trying to make the world a better place, that's all. By deleting the surplus. "Cure the world." And whom, exactly, do you intend to "delete"? The garbage. The imbeciles who lie around drunk, reproducing like rabbits. And sitting there with their hand out, expecting the rest of us to pay. And let's be frank, who's gonna miss them anyway? [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] Kill him. [GUN COCKS] [SOFTLY SOBBING] [STADIUM CROWD CHANTING IN DISTANCE] [GRUNTS THEN TRACKER BEEPS] [RECEIVER BEEPING] You're new to this. You ever killed a man before? [ALL GRUNTING] Are you gonna shoot me? No. How is it you English football supporters say? Oh, yes. You're going to get your bloody head kicked in. ♪ Come and have a go If you think you're hard enough N [BOTH GRUNTING] Ow! Maybe just shoot me. Get up. [CHUCKLES] [ON PHONE] J' I don't see nothing wrong ♪ ♪ With a little bump and grind With a little bump and grind a' ♪ I don't see nothing wrong h' Time to say goodbye to your... ...hideous pig wife. Let me give you some advice, Ukrainian Ben Affleck. Never ever slag off a Grimsby lass. You don't have guts. Oh. Well, that were easy. Hi. Amazing. Gotta get one of these for the kids. You have a family? I just reconnected with mine. I'm going to go home and-- [GUNSHOT] This killing business is a right laugh, isn't it? I understand why you love guns. I mean, it completely detaches you from the guilt of your actions. [MAN YELLING] Ta-da! Heh. [B LOWS] Bonus point. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [GUNSHOT] Will you stop shooting everything? [GUNSHOTS] ANNOUNCER: It's Germany 1, England 1, and it's anyone's final now. - Get that feed up. Get it up. WOMAN: I'm trying. - Come on, come on. ANNOUNCER: So little time remaining. Four minutes to decide the final. NOBBY: Mission accomplished. All we need is England to score. This'll be the best day of my life. What? Every man, woman and child in this stadium is about to die. Put this in your ear. Jodie, I need you to check for anywhere that might contain the virus. Okay, I will scan for the chemical signature. - This is hopeless. - No, it's not. Look who just sat down. Need to stop her before she sets off the virus. - Listen, let's go around the stadium. - We can't. There's not enough time. We need to go across the pitch. - Pitch invasion. - Too much security. - We'll never make it alone. - Alone? We are not alone. ANNOUNCER: It's England who are looking more likely to steal a late winner. - Hey, give me that. - Nobby! Sit down! Come on. Men and women of Grimsby, listen up. This is important. You see that lass over there? What? Sharon Osbourne? No. She's gonna release this deadly virus... ...and it's gonna kill poor people like us... ...because she thinks that we are scum. Bloody hell, Nobby, we are scum. Well-- Well, you are, Pete. You're a registered sex offender. That's not a compliment. So we're scum, are we? Well, let me tell you something about scum: It's scum who built the hospitals that are now closing down. ALL: Yeah. It's scum who die in the wars started by the bastards in charge. ALL: Yeah. It's scum that keep the Fast and Furious franchise alive. ALL: Yeah! So I ask you to join with us now... ...and storm that pitch... ALL: Yeah! ...and show the world that scum cannot be washed away, ever. ALL: Yeah! MAN: Yeah! Yeah! ALL: We are the scum! Whoo! [LAUGHS] Yeah! We started too early. DAWN: Whoo! It's Graves. - Keep him away from me. - Okay, the target is on the move. - I'll sync with your lens. - Nobby... ...you ready for a fight? I thought you'd never ask. Green Earth. [BEEPING] JODIE: Target heading southwest through the German section. [ALL GRUNTING] [BOTH YELLING] SEBASTIAN: Come on. Whoa. ANNOUNCER: Well, sanity has returned, and so have the players. The show will go on. The final will be restarted. SEBASTIAN: Jodie, where's the virus? - I still can't find it. Nobby, meet the head of the biggest crime syndicate in the world. What, she runs FIFA? - Who's this idiot? - His name's Sebastian. Boys! Oh, bollocks. Go! [ALL GRUNTING] NOBBY: Quick! She's getting away! [CROWD CHEERING] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [IMITATING CONNERY] So we meet again. JODIE: Found it. Virus is in one of the fireworks. - Shoot her before she detonates it. -[IN NORMAL VOICE] But what if I miss? I trust you. NOBBY: Oi! ANNOUNCER: Ten seconds. That's all that's left. Oh, look at Sterling! With a chance! Oh! ANNOUNCER: Oh, no! It's going over the bar! NOBBY: Oh, no, it's not. ANNOUNCER: But wait! What's happened to the ball? It's bounced in! [CROWD CHEERING] No, the referee's gonna disallow it. - The goal stands. - Yes! ANNOUNCER: England have won it! JODIE: Come on, Nobby. Stop shooting everything and focus. NOBBY [OVER EARBUD]: Don't worry. I've got this. [GUN CLICKING] Jodie, me gun's jammed. Oh, no. BOY: Excuse me, miss. RHONDA: Yes? Go fuck yourself! Yes! Yes! Yes! We did it, Seb! SEBASTIAN: Yeah! Yeah! Sanjiv, now! - Got it. - What? Please, no! No! Goodbye, Sebastian. No! No! [ALL SHOUTING AND SHRIEKING] [BEEPING] Cure the world! No! SEBASTIAN: Too late! - There's no way to stop the fireworks! - I'll jump on them. It won't work. The virus is in the tip of the firework. It would need to explode in a contained environment to stop it spreading. There's nothing you can do. [FIREWORKS WHISTLING] Yes, there is. I'm from Grimsby. Jodie, which firework is it in? It's in the central left-hand rocket. - What are you doing? - Contributing to society. - Unh. Unh! ALL: Oh! [SQUEALS] Oh, Nobby. It's the firework to your left, not my left. For fuck's sake! Yah... Tell my kids that Daddy died with dignity. [GRUNTS] Nobby, can you hear me? The firework next to you also has the virus. What? No. But I don't have another asshole. I need another asshole. You've got one. I'm from Grimsby too... ...and I'm never gonna let you leave me again. [GRUNTS] [PANTING] Oh, my God, Graves. - Butcher Boys of Grimsby, together... - Forever. [BOTH YELLING] [ALL GASP] [YELLING] [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING ON TV] Donald Trump has AIDS. Philanthropist Rhonda George has been arrested. Middle East peace symbol Schlomo Khalidi is in custody... ...following the murder of MI6 agent Jeremy Chilcott. I didn't do it. I've had the worst ******* week ever. **** Israel. **** Palestine. **** all of you. England fans in high spirits after Cup final victory. Rogue MI6 operative Sebastian Graves and his brother Nobby Butcher... ...died at the scene while preventing the release of a deadly toxin. In other news, a South African hotel maid has filed a suit alleging sexual assault... ...by Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher. Gallagher is also being sought for abusing an elephant... ...in conjunction with Fast and Furious star Vin Diesel. JODIE: Naturally, you'll both be needing new identities. How are you guys doing? How does me ass look? Good. Uh, really good. It's a bit smoky in here, Jodie. Can we have the fan on, please? Of course. So you were saved from the virus by an antibody found in elephant semen... ...which lined, uh... [AIR WHISTLING] ...uh, your innards. We're like a pair of pan pipes. Great. And I thought you were going to be faithful, Sebastian. You know, you really filled a hole in my life. Hi. - Nobby. - Dad. GIRL: Dad! BRITNEY: Oh, my God. [ALL CHUCKLING] I'm so glad that you're alive. NOBBY: You know what? Family. It's the greatest gift in life. [LAUGHING] Stop throwing coins in there. It's not a brown wishing well. THURBECK [OVER EARBUD]: You are now transmitting. Stand by. Stand by. Eyes on the target. JODIE: Listen, we're sending information to your lens. NOBBY: I've got this. Blue Earth.

Excuse me. Which way to the stadium? Straight on for 5 kilometers, then to the right. Thank you. [GUNSHOT THEN BODY THUDS] Leave no witnesses.
