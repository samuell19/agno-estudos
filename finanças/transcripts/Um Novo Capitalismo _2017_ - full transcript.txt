[man speaking in Portuguese] We decided to make this film in 2008. The first country we visited was India, in October, 2008, when the American Congress announced the largest private bank rescue plan in history. [laughs] That same month, there is an ancient festival in India called Diwali. It's a sacred festival celebrating the victory of good over evil inside every human being. After that crisis, social inequality only got worse. According to a study from Oxfam, the world's 63 richest people together... SOCIAL INVESTOR - VOX CAPITAL ...are just as wealthy as the world's 3.5 billion poorest people. The stories we want to tell in this film try to demonstrate that restlessness towards the extreme inequality we see around the world. After all, what is the legacy each one of us wants to leave to the world? What kind of society do we want to build to be more sustainable and more inclusive? A NEW CAPITALISM [in English] Poverty is darkness. SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR - GRAMEEN BANK You don't see anything at the end, what's happening. It's... You are trapped in a-- in a kind of a box, uh, where you don't see any opening. [horns honking] [man] I remember vividly when I was hardly four or five years old. Next door, two houses away, I heard shouting and yelling in the early morning. And I was told that the pregnant woman, during delivery, died. FOUNDER - ARAVIND EYE CARE SYSTEM That lady must have been hardly about 20 at that time, and that upsets me. A young woman hardly 20 years old suddenly dying and you don't see her anymore. And I thought, can we do something to prevent it? [children clamoring] [in Hindi] Earlier, I was cutting edges. Later on, I couldn't do that. Due to blindness, I could cut wrongly. So I started to work as a sweeper. Slowly, I started to have blurred eyesight. I went and told my uncle about my eye problem. After sunset, I couldn't see. One day, my mother fell sick. So my son and I went to buy medicine. On the way, I had an accident with a bike. In the darkness, I couldn't see the light. I cried out to my son. Then he came near me. With his help, I crossed the road and came home. I came and cried to my mother. I told her that I had an accident. She consoled me. We asked someone for help. I feel at times, if I become blind, my son will become an orphan. How will we lead our life? At times, I felt like that. ABOUT 39 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE BLIND. AND 8 MILLION OF THEM ARE IN INDIA. [woman speaking in English] So cataract is basically a clouding of the lens. So the lens normally is a clear and crystalline structure and this opacifies over time. But we can prevent blindness because of cataract. And that is done through the help of a simple surgery where we remove this opacified lens and instead implant a plastic IOL lens or similar power to the eye, so the patient will be able to see very well after the surgery. ARAVIND EYE HOSPITAL [in English] We have a hospital here, in Aravind, in Madurai, or any of our locations. CHAIRMAN - ARAVIND EYE CARE SYSTEM We have a paying hospital and a free hospital. If you see the paying hospital, if we get about 1000 patients here, we'll get maybe, like, 300 patients in the free hospitals. [in English] I don't insist that the man must pay me before I do anything for him. I say, "I'll give you the sight, man." Let him give whatever he can give. If he cannot afford, it doesn't matter. He can give later. AT AVARIND, AN APPOINTMENT COSTS LESS THAN A DOLLAR. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT CHOOSE TO PAY FOR THE APPOINTMENT IS THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE ONES THAT SEEK FREE OR SUBSIDIZED TREATMENTS. PEOPLE PREFER PAYING A SMALL AMOUNT THAN NOT PAYING AT ALL. THAT SYSTEM ENSURES THE SERVICE'S SURVIVAL AND PRESERVES THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY. [in Hindi] Before coming here, at home, I couldn't see properly. The vision was partial. In this eye, there was a burning sensation. When I had burning, I used to remain at home. By God's grace, I'm making the effort and trying to do business successfully. [in English] There is also the problem of having blind people... OPHTHALMOLOGIST ARAVIND EYE CARE SYSTEM ...in the age group who are productive. And, at that age, if someone is not able to see, they cannot support their family, in which case they become a burden to the family. And it's not just them they'll have-- find difficulty supporting, but the family also. Someone has to stay back at home and take care of them. So that kind of ruins their life the next ten, 20, 30 years after that. [indistinct chatter] [Nageswari speaking in Hindi] I thought of even admitting my son in an orphanage. When I had eyesight problem, I told my uncle. Uncle took me to the hospital. He inquired here. I was taken to the doctor. After consulting them, I got operated on. [both speaking in Hindi] [in English] Initially, Dr. Venkataswamy, like, he always-- he was very much for the fact that we had to make eye care accessible to all, irrespective of the amount they were able to pay. So there was a concept of trying to give eye care at a very subsidized rate or even for free. Uh, even at that stage, it was found that there is still a lot of blindness in the villages. And then it was found that the patients did not come for eye care for various other reasons. For example, they had a big inhibition about trying to go to this big city, a new hospital, a new place. The council asked how they would get to-- The transportation was an issue. The cost of it was an issue. So having all these factors figured out, then evolved the concept of having community outreach. That's when we had the eye camps initiated, and then teams started to go out to the different rural areas, and the message was spread. So then the patients found it much easier to come on that specific date, and they would get their eyes checked up. And if surgery was required, they are brought in by the same van to the hospital to have surgery, and dropped off back at the point where they were picked up in their own villages. [speaking in Hindi] [speaking in Hindi] [Dr. Ravindran in English] His concept, he had been to America several times, and he had seen McDonald's shops all over America. And he found that the infrastructure being the same, the quality of service is the same, and the product quality is the same. So he felt that if we are able to do the same thing, they can create similar infrastructures, train people to do cataract surgeries the same way, take care of the preoperative care, post-operative care, all that in a particular way, we may be able to take care of the problem of the blindness. Because the cataract constitutes maybe 80 percent of the blindness at that point of time. FREE LODGING THE SECOND MOST POPULATED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, INDIA, HAS AROUND 1.26 BILLION INHABITANTS. AROUND 46.5 MILLION HAVE BEEN TO THE ARAVIND. [Dr. Ravindran in English] The most expensive thing [stammering] is to create the infrastructure, having the equipment instruments, setting up the operating room, all that. Second is the human resources, especially the doctors. If you have a way to maximize the productivity of your doctor, maximize the productivity and usage time of your equipment instruments, then definitely you can make surplus from your operations. One thing we do is, uh... to make sure that doctors do what they daily have to do. Which means we have a lot of delegation of responsibilities to the paramedical manpower, who are not so expensive. So ophthalmologists do a lot of measurements. So instead of the doctors doing it, we have the paramedical ophthalmic personnel do that work, like our nurses. [speaking in Hindi] [in English] The surgeon's whole energy was into trying to do the surgery much better and in light kind of times, so they'll also be much faster because they've been doing it for so long. And when they do volume, they tend to see more problem cases, more complex cases, And with that, their skill level will also improve. [in English] Like all of the major hospitals, both are paying outpatient department and a free outpatient one. Both are separate. So anybody who goes into paying or free, it is up to them, we don't force anybody. Even if somebody goes to the free hospital, we don't ask for any document to show that they are socially or economically backward. So we leave that choice to the patient. [in English] In terms of surgery or in terms of the amount you expect on each surgery, it does not matter if it's a patient who can pay or if it's someone who does not pay for his own surgery. But what does matter is we might do a different technique for a patient who pays. For example, if a patient is paying for a multifocal eye lens so he can have the latest technology. So that obviously we have a small difference there, but in terms of looking at the amount of respect you'd give to that surgery or in terms of complication-free, or the quality, or the amount of time, it would be the same, irrespective if they are paying or the free surgery. In the free hospital, we have those patients who have not as severely advanced cataracts or a very severe pathology. If you look at these patients from some of these camps, but for this camp, probably they would be at home blind. So you know that they're making a life-changing experience for them with this simple five-minute procedure. So that gives certainly a lot of satisfaction. That is something which the surgeons definitely do, uh, value a lot. -[horn honking] -[people clamoring] [speaking in Hindi] [music playing on radio] [Nageswari in Hindi] After getting operated on, I could see and walk well. Now the eyesight is very clear, I could see clearly and walk around. When I go out with my son, I can see clearly. He is also satisfied now. First, I worked as a cleaner. I take and give cloth pieces to them. They'll stitch those pieces. Now I help her in the household work. I can cook on the stove, too. With that, I do the household work also. I could see clearly after keeping that lens. I felt very happy. [Dr. Ravindran in English] Today, the blindness of the world may be the failure to see the suffering of a lot more of our own brothers and sisters across the world. [speaking in Hindi] [in Portuguese] The easiest way to think about this new model of companies that have an impact, that can be called "social business," is thinking about two axes. On one of them, you have the search for financial return. On the other, you have the search for social impact. And there are some businesses that intend to be on that second quadrant. So how can I have both positive impact and positive return? While in traditional logic, you have "either, or." Either I do this, or I do that. I think a really meaningful innovation is thinking of "and," because we see it is clearly possible to have both things. [man in Portuguese] From all students that begin high school in Brazil, about half stay behind. They either don't finish school or they start working, or they don't do anything, but they don't finish it. FOUNDER - GEEKIE From the half that does finish school, ten percent have the expected knowledge, not above that, of Portuguese and mathematics. This is Brazil's reality. These people are working out there, going to companies, working on foundations, on government departments. That is the manpower Brazil has. That is the qualification of the people in our country today. That is inequality. THE FASTEST WAY TO ENEM ALREADY REGISTERED [Claudio] Project Geekie Games is our ENEM product, that is, our idea is to help people to do better on ENEM. ENEM IS AN EXAM THAT ALLOWS ACCESS TO PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER BRAZIL. GEEKIE GAMES PROVIDES ENEM SIMULATIONS AND CREATES PERSONALIZED STUDY PLANS. ENEM is the doorway to federal universities, scholarships, to student funding. So ENEM became a huge opportunity, especially for students of public schools to either do professionalizing courses or go to a federal university. [man in Portuguese] I was studying for ENEM, I'm a senior, when the government announced on their website that they'd provide a learning platform with ENEM simulations. [in Portuguese] In 2013, the platform was available for 60 days prior to ENEM. Over two million students subscribed to it, there were 660,000 active users. We reached all states in Brazil, 90 percent of the country's municipalities, three million online classes were watched, nine million text classes were read, around 30 to 40 million exercises done. And we saw that the impact was that with 70 percent of the score identified as a person not knowing something, by the end of the two months, people learned, became knowledgeable. Besides that, students with the lowest scores improved three times more than the average. So those who needed it the most, who had more difficulties, learned through our platform. [man in Portuguese] I thought it was such a suitable platform that I could make better use of it. When I saw it showed our weaknesses, I said, "This is what I was missing!" Now we know what we're good at and what is our weakness, that one thing you have to learn. [Claudio in Portuguese] We assume that nobody learns the same way. But the education system is standardized. Teachers teach the same way, with the same books, it is the same level of difficulty for everyone, even though we know people don't learn the same way. Why teach the same way if people don't learn the same way? So using technology to change that process, instead of the student having to adapt to the teacher or the book, breaking with that and having content being adapted to how each person learns, to me, it was what we needed. Being able to offer a personalized education, according to how each person learns, makes sense to me. It's a really old idea. The concept of private tutors and instructors has always existed and people pay a lot for that because it is personalized care. It is someone who understands how you learn, what your difficulties are and comes up with a way to teach you that is in sync with your reality and how you learn. That is what got our team together, that is what made people give up careers on the financial market, at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, at multinational companies. They are really special people. And just as Geekie seeks these people, top companies in the world with unlimited financial resources are also competing for these people. We must have a sustainable, virtuous financial model that allows us to grow quickly and that can stand that growth and compensate these people, so they won't have to choose between going to Google or to another company, like Unilever, and then do some social work as a volunteer. But I want these people there 24 hours a day. If your team is not good, if they are not the best, when you have to apply what you learn to remodel your product, if you take six months to do that, your money and the company are gone. There is no dream, no impact. There's nothing left. When there is financial pressure, we decide to focus on private schools because the return will come sooner. If you are not sure about what brought you there and made you give up on other things to follow a different path based on values you believe in, it is very easy to get lost. Geekie's profit comes from our clients. We sell especially to private schools now. These private schools buy products from Geekie, they usually pay a sum per student or per simulated test. If we only sold to private schools, we'd be increasing inequality. And that doesn't make sense to us because 85 percent of Brazil's youth in basic education go to public schools. They need it the most. [in Portuguese] To me, a perfect Brazil would have education as a priority. [in Portuguese] They are allowed to dream, to want more, to dream of going to college or taking a technical course, or getting a foreign scholarship. They can dream of having a future that is different from what they were born into and from their family's current conditions. I find that wonderful. [in Portuguese] I want to apply for Theater and Electrical Engineering. OUT OF 100, 97 SCHOOLS WITH THE BEST GRADES IN ENEM 2015 WERE PRIVATE. [Claudio in Portuguese] I want Geekie to be an example that things can be different. That you don't have to choose between changing the world and making money. You can do both. IN BRAZIL, 91% OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WERE BELOW AVERAGE THIS YEAR. [in Portuguese] When we wake up, our motivation really is offering the best quality possible to all Brazilians, regardless of ethnicity, religion, financial or social conditions. Throughout the day, it is the love for what we do, doing more with less, in a better and faster way, valuing transparency, dealing with well-intentioned partners, and creating a virtuous circle around what you believe in. At 3:00 a.m., obviously, there is war. It is when you are tired, you want to give up, when you ask why you are doing all of this. That is when you connect with your soul, it is when you remind yourself of why you do things, of what you believe in, of what really matters to you. In this interesting moment we are living in Brazil, we are reminded that being honest and doing the right thing is probably the longest path, but it is the only path for us and it is where we want to build our history. Doing the right thing for us is not a matter of choice. It is a commitment to our principles, to our country, and to the society we live in. [Antonio in Portuguese] It is a very limiting concept to see poverty as only regarding income. Amartya Sen is an Indian thinker and economist who won the Nobel Prize. He speaks of a person's development as an increase in their degree of freedom. So coming out of poverty is increasing your level of freedom to exist in the world. When you think about that, you realize how important it is to have an education, to have a minimum or ideal knowledge basis to be able to make your own decisions. The same goes for housing. How constrained are you if you have poor housing conditions, which can also have an impact on your health? [helicopter rotor whirring] [woman in Portuguese] Let's go with these children. Where, my God of heaven? -[woman] Daughter of a bitch. -[man screaming] [people clamoring] [in Portuguese] I see these things on TV and think, "That won't happen to us." But it's really sad seeing that. Especially for my son, seeing his house getting knocked down. [in Portuguese] We start thinking, "What am I going to do? I built so much, I fought so much, I struggled so much," even though it's an invasion. It's tough waking up and seeing your house on the ground. Can you imagine your house on the ground? [in Portuguese] We found a new model... FOUNDER - TERRA NOVA ...that dissolves that conflict over land ownership between owners of private properties and their invaders. OVER 1 BILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN INADEQUATE HOUSES IN THE WORLD. AROUND 16 MILLION BRAZILIAN FAMILIES LIVE IN PRECARIOUS HOUSES. AND 9.8 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN PRIVATE LANDS THAT WERE ILLEGALLY OCCUPIED. [André] Evacuation is scheduled in a few days from now. That evacuation is usually done with police reinforcement, with police teams. Even though they are instructed to avoid conflict, it's difficult for the population not to create conflict because they are really desperate and those houses are all they have. -[man] Is this your house, Daiane? -[in Portuguese] Yeah. This is my house. -Did you build it? -My husband and I did. This is my art. I'm also an architect, but I don't know how. It's just to make the house look prettier, so it won't be too ugly. We can do anything, we just don't want to leave. -You know? -[metal clanks] [man] What about the electrical installation? That's in a state of public calamity because we can't call the energy supplier and we can't have piped water. So we live like this, with the wires all exposed, we jury-rig it and take wires here and there. [in Portuguese] We live in this community as I told you, we've been living here for nine years. IRANI DE OLIVEIRA AND DAUGHTER REBECA It's complicated because it's up to the court now. We are worried, but people are trying to solve this because everyone here wants to pay, nobody is denying. Nobody occupied this place to steal anything from anyone. When he came to see it, along with the major and the bailiff, and he brought some people to get to know the area, Daiane and I tried to talk to him. I said, "Sir, we tried to come to an agreement with you, we don't want to take what is yours." He said, "You've been disturbing me for ten years, there's no agreement." [in Portuguese] Come in. Come, babies. Come in, make yourselves at home. I have a slight limp. -[man] Who lives here today? -Myself, my husband and our five kids. That's all. This is our youngest. For now. There's another coming. I think it was when we had to build another room. We built this one and it was after that that the owner came asking for it. So I stopped. It's going to stay like this. It will cost him nothing to knock it down. And the lawyer said we shouldn't move a thing. [in Portuguese] Who is to blame for that happening? The society, the people who occupied it, the landowner, who maybe let that happen. There's no use in blaming people or punishing the residents. It's a social problem. People crowd together in big cities in that precarious way because of a contingency of our civilization model. [woman in Portuguese] We're here! They want us to move out really soon, on the 25th. I can't manage. We won't leave. We'll get organized, pay for it. [in Portuguese] We are trying to avoid making you leave. That's another story. We need to get the press' attention. It's no use if they get here later. We have to change that and get the public opinion's attention before it happens. We want to make an event at the city council. -Really? -Yeah. I think we can make great publicity about forced eviction in Sao Paulo. We want to make an event that gives visibility to your problem. [Daiane in Portuguese] When the police came here, they said they'd get a warrant, that we had to leave, that they'd demolish it. They came with the owner, who said that even if I had an old stove, it would be auctioned. I said, "That's not how we should do it." He said it was. [in Portuguese] He is right to want his things back. I don't agree with it just because we're trying to get to an agreement. We want to pay for it and he won't accept it. [in Portuguese] If we can't change this until eviction day, it will get much more difficult. They will destroy the houses in a few days. [in Portuguese] I don't want to go back to paying rent because I starved many times to pay it. [André in Portuguese] We do this by organizing the community, making leaders stronger, negotiating with the residents' association regarding the payment of a compensation to the landowner. We are usually sought after by landowners or by the community, often referred to us by city halls, when they don't have a solution and say they know a company that settles these things. [in Portuguese] If you left, where would you go? Honestly, I have nowhere to go. If we left all of a sudden, we'd have nowhere to go. We'd have to rent something. And even then, it would be difficult to get a place, like a house, that quickly. Not to mention that all the kids go to school. The school is nearby and that makes things more difficult. Because school matters, too. -[André] It does. -It does. A lot. Terra Nova's work is trying to settle conflicts... -[child screaming] -through judicial settlements. We proposed a measure to cancel the sentence given regarding ownership repossession. Actually, the owner didn't want to negotiate, but we hope the legal system will reevaluate that and establish a price for the land. We are also trying to appeal to the public opinion so we can draw attention to the problem before it actually happens. Because it's no use calling the press later. Let's say you actually leave, as it happened elsewhere, then it's such a mess, with the police and people leaving. It's a commotion, people are moved by the situation. But if that happens after the eviction, it doesn't matter to you anymore. [in Portuguese] Hey, how's it going? Were you the caretaker here? Yeah. This picture shows how this terrain was. [André in Portuguese] I had some pictures taken of that area and when I show them to people, they are moved. I show them the kids, how established people are. It seems like the families are just a number, but when people actually see them, they realize they are not a number, but people just like us. [in Portuguese] He seems like a really kind person who likes helping others. But this is also his work, you know? He won't do a good deed, having to come here from Curitiba, without getting something from that. That's fair enough. All betterments he does here, as we've already agreed, will be included in the bill that we will probably pay when we win. And we will gladly pay for their work. They are a company and companies only work for money. [laughs] Right? It's not for doing good deeds or out of charity. [in Portuguese] We get a percentage of what people pay to the owner. Being able to profit from that operation... was an exercise of experimenting with various percentages. At first, we didn't really know what that meant. So... We didn't know how much we'd have to get to be able to keep the business going and still have something left to reinvest. [all speaking in Portuguese] We want our homes or we'll make Brazil stop! We want our homes or we'll make Brazil stop! We want our homes! We want our homes! We will pay for them! We will pay for them! [in Portuguese] You have to leave the paper! [all] We want our homes or we'll make Brazil stop! We want our homes or we'll make Brazil stop! Sometimes you can turn a small case into a cause and defend it. We are not defending that community and their right to live there. Through them, we are defending a much bigger cause. This is a symbolic act to reinforce that demand. We have a meeting in court at 5:00 p.m. to talk directly to the judge responsible for that sentence and try to sensitize him and the magistrate working on this. In the model we use, people pay, they earn their title through their effort, valuing that asset. People and the community have to seize the power of transformation. We can't try to change people's lives leaving them as passive agents. [chanting] JD. LOURDES FULFILLS ITS SOCIAL FUNCTION BY HOUSING 300 FAMILIES CITY COUNCIL OF SÃO PAULO [in Portuguese] Can you organize their entrance? SYMBOLIC ACT TO DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THE CITY'S CHAIRMEN TO THE PROBLEM AT JARDIM LOURDES. [André] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and all the members of this important community who showed... such eagerness today to fight for their rights and to draw the attention of the public authority, of institutions and of the civil society in general to the forced eviction that afflicts you. You built your houses, you occupied an area of the city, and nobody occupies a place like the one you live in, a private property, if they don't need it, if they are not in a situation of extreme vulnerability. [horns honking] [woman applauding, cheering] SAO PAULO STATE COURT OF APPEALS MEETING WITH THE HEAD OF THE SUPPORT GROUP TO REINTEGRATION ORDERS [in Portuguese] You have to move them, tell your story, tell them you want to stay and pay for the houses. That's important. Tell them about the protest and how you organized it. That helps because he'll be moved by your struggle to stay. It's everyone's responsibility. Each person has the power to do something to help. The government plays an important role in this, but it's not the only one. I think that, within the perspective we have now, transformation is much slower when in the government's hands. I think the private sector is faster when solving human problems. That's why I believe in the capital as a solution that is born in the market, like the "two-and-a-half sector," which creates social businesses, moving money around needs and making it go back to the capital. [boy] Daddy, don't you want to sit there? No, I'm looking for something in the newspaper. Something really important. -Do it sitting on the chair. -Not now. Here. Reintegration on the East Zone is scheduled for the 25th. IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, IRREGULAR NEIGHBORHOOD IN SAO PAULO EXPECTS A 'MIRACLE' JARDIM LOURDES DAY SCHEDULED FOR EVICTION We'll have a surprise party for Mr. André, Mr. Fábio and Senival to thank them for getting the injunction revoked. As I said, if it weren't for them, we don't know where we'd be now. I'll have a peaceful sleep tonight. When they said we'd get knocked down, I bought a TV and a couch. I never lost hope. Let's move on. I'm sure it already worked. [all cheering, applauding] Thank you so much for what you did for us. I'm sure it's not just for money. If you didn't have a good heart, you wouldn't be here. You wouldn't leave your wife, your kids and your home to fight for us, you know? [André] I always say that if we want to solve social problems out of brotherly love, it may take us 5,000 years. If ending poverty becomes a good business to everyone, we may be able to solve it in 500 years. There lies the difference. Human beings still care more about good deals than brotherly love. But we'll get to brotherly love, too. I think we will move towards a model that is very decentralized when it comes to power. Traditional structures are collapsing, be it in the public sector, in big companies, in churches. They are collapsing when it comes to the amount of power they garnered 100 or 200 years ago. Also, with new technologies and access to information, with the ability to collaborate and with creative or shared economy, we see power going to the hands of the people. That model makes me feel very optimistic about the future. New governance models will also have to be invented. How can we stop having one percent of the population creating public policies or products and services, as if looking at everything from Mount Olympus, like Greek gods who are aware of what the population needs? With such a level of estrangement that they are in Washington trying to solve problems of the people of Madurai, India. So I think we should move towards a model in which people are aware of what their problems are and decide by themselves what their solutions should be. And we need platforms, not only in technology, but opportunity platforms, to allow people to come up with solutions for their problems. MEXICO CITY [in Spanish] Come in. Come in. Over here. I used to live in those rooms. Come closer to see it. I used to live in those rooms. Before. My husband. My husband. I've showed you where we lived. Come in. I live here now. I live here now. My story with Compartamos started many years ago with loans for groups. Now they give me up to 100,000 pesos. And it's an individual loan now. Thanks to Compartamos' loans, we've expanded our business. We opened a carpentry shop. All of our pieces are made in our carpentry shop. We don't buy them anymore. They are exclusively ours. Compartamos Bank was founded... DIRECTOR ADVISOR - COMPARTAMOS BANK ...around 18 years ago. Compartamos Bank's intention then was simply to help, to be able to give people, especially women in rural areas, means to keep their businesses going. During their progress, from an economic perspective, they were able to follow the evolution of social development. When I started... FOUNDER - COMPARTAMOS BANK ...I was 22 years old and had no assets, nor a bank account or any money. So I realized that in philanthropy, there were people with important names from important families in the country, who had fortunes and bank accounts that could accomplish a lot. When I started to work with that, I realized I had to dedicate 80 percent of my time to asking for money and only 20 percent to distributing it. Then I thought, "That equation is not working. If I want to work with the inclusion and the development of the least privileged and I dedicate most of my time to asking for money, then maybe I'm not being efficient enough." When we started to work in the social sector... CHAIRMAN - COMPARTAMOS BANK ...we wanted quick social profit, but also economic profit, or at least self-sustainability. We weren't bankers. We are not bankers. We have no formal education on finance. CO-FOUNDER - COMPARTAMOS BANK So we didn't know this sector's practices. But I think that was an advantage because we didn't have to follow a number of paradigms regarding why the population had no access to loans. Without those paradigms, we could be bolder. We were able to learn from other experiences in the world, adapting them and making them suitable to the Mexican reality. I started with Compartamos when they were starting, too. I didn't know what Compartamos was. They came to visit us. People knocked at our door, "Listen, can we give you a loan for your business? Can you start your own business?" "Yes." So I accepted it. At first, I was afraid they were deceiving us. Deep down, it's not just lending money, opening savings accounts or selling insurance. What we want is to give people an opportunity to grow. That is the essence of what we want. I started getting small loans when I was very young. Ten thousand pesos, eight thousand, 25,000, later 35,000, then 50,000. Now I managed to get 100,000. I started with little money. Nobody would give me a loan. They don't know you, so they doubt you. We started by renting a small space. With time, we grew and now these spaces are ours. Thanks to Compartamos who always supported us, our hard work and the purchase of new machinery. The use of business or commercial principles to solve social problems... We see in our activity, in a certain way, a connection between the world's greatest capitals and our client, a modest micro-entrepreneur. And we are in the middle. Compartamos' definition is creating social value, economic value and human value. Social value by serving the largest amount of people in the shortest time. It's our indicator, with these client protection characteristics. Economic value by generating profit, but not forgetting that link between the world's greatest capitals and the segment we serve. And human value is what I think we lack the most. Human value... If we want a better society, we must give people better conditions. The poor are the people. I mean, there are no poor and non-poor people, as different individuals, we are all the same. So the challenge now is to convince and include everyone in this mission of equality. We should all fight for equality, for a world where we are all equal. A world where we can all hope for full development. A world where each one of us can be the architect of their own life. A world where each of us can be the protagonist of their development. A world where, due to intellectual, physical and emotional abilities, we can all be truly free. COMPARTAMOS BANK CONCENTRATES 42% OF THE MICROCREDIT GRANTED IN MEXICO. ALMOST 44% OF MEXICAN ADULTS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE FORMAL BANKING SYSTEM. [Antonio in Portuguese] Utopia is always on the horizon. When you take two steps forward, so does utopia. But I think the field of social businesses is far from utopia. When you see that, over time, Compartamos grew much quicker than other organizations, including and especially non-profit organizations. It has reached a scale that allows it to offer the lowest interest rate in the entire sector in Mexico. Because they grew, are more efficient, have technology, they have a much better education as a credit agency, so they can pass that on to the client. Which is funny because that was the founders' intention when they created it and it was a non-profit organization. From the talks we had, their purpose never changed. But they realized they had a responsibility to grow as quickly as possible while all of the Mexican population still couldn't get their product, which is small loans, microcredit. "TAUNTING" [in Portuguese] She is the youngest bank president you will ever see in your lives. A millionaire? No. An heiress? No. And she didn't win the lottery. She doesn't have an affair with any Wall Street businessman. And she's not a gold digger. Who is, then, this banker princess who's only 25 years old? Her bank is called Pérola. You've never heard of it. Almost no one has. And its president is Alessandra França. [audience cheering] Alessandra França, banks lend money to those who prove they already have it. How is your bank different? I would say "our bank" is more appropriate. "Ours" as in it belongs to all the young people who are now part of the Pérola Bank. They have no history, but they have a dream and that dream allows them to pay back the money they borrow. What bank was your inspiration when creating yours? Muhammad Yunus. I read his book Banker to the Poor when I was 16 years old and I was amazed by it, I pictured myself there. I was so amazed, I thought, "One day, I'm either going there or I'm going to do something very similar here." Do you want to change the world? It is my dream and my desire. [Alessandra] My family is from the Paraná countryside. They were small farmers, but they had a problem and lost everything, so they came to Sorocaba. When I was 15... FOUNDER - PÉROLA BANK ...a social organization settled here, they were called Projeto Pérola, and their intention was providing IT courses to poor children. I was one of their students. At the end of the course, they were going to award scholarships. I applied for it and won a scholarship. It was a scholarship to go to a better school and to work at the Projeto Pérola as an IT instructor. That was when my career started, when I was 15. When I was 16, I read Muhammad Yunus' Banker to the Poor, which also influenced me and amazed me. How was it possible to do so much with so little? [woman in Portuguese] I started working at a trinkets shop. I was selling more and more. One bag wasn't enough for the month so I started to take two. I did the math and thought, "Wait. If I'm this motivated working for other people, what if I worked for myself?" If I bought and retailed everything myself. I thought about it. But since it was helping my income, I couldn't use it to invest. Then a friend called me, "I saw an ad for the Pérola Bank, have you heard of it?" She gave me their number and I called them. My first contact was with Tati. You know what happened? I have to finish my store and another store came up selling everything. They said, "Come here, we'll talk and I'll explain how our bank works. We'll study your case, but don't worry, everything will work out. It already has." [Alessandra] Entrepreneurs usually hear about our bank from other entrepreneurs or through social media, which is very common now. When they get in contact with Pérola Bank, they call us to schedule a credit check. After that, we tell them the first steps, because we work with solidarity groups, which is very common in microcredit. That group works like this. I'm an entrepreneur and I have an idea or a working business. I need at least two more entrepreneurs in my community who also have an idea for a business or that already have one. Then I get together with them and with the group, I come to the Pérola Bank and ask for the loan. So we have a solidary guarantee. That relationship is our first filter. They needed three people, so I got in. -We can put anyone in it. -We trust each other. We must get in because it's always three people. -If we don't pay, she pays. -Hey, Verena! -Nice. -Do you accept kids? [Alessandra] After the group is established and people have vouched for each other, so, "I believe you, you believe me, let's make a group to get the loan," the credit agent goes to the community and performs the credit check. They analyze the business' behavior, conditions, the guarantee, and their ability to pay. If all three entrepreneurs have those three characteristics, the loan is granted. The first one was of three thousand, the second, too. Then it got higher, five, seven, nine. [interviewer in Portuguese] How many did you get? Six, I think. Right? Six. -Six loans? -Yes. I do believe the bank helps lessening social inequality simply because we believe in these people. Once, an entrepreneur said something that stayed with us. When we gave him the money, the loan, he said, "Wow. Somebody believes in me. Now I believe in me, too." YOUTH: WE BELIEVE IN THE POTENTIAL OF YOUNG PEOPLE. WE BET ON THE POTENTIAL OF YOUNG PEOPLE. When you look up the root of the word "credit," it means trust. It was supposed to be something beautiful and good and we try to get that back. When we grant credit to someone, we're saying they're capable of having their own business and of changing their lives. [Rosilene in Portuguese] You must be talented to be an entrepreneur. I know that now. Being an entrepreneur is not that simple. I make things get sold. I take pictures. I just bought some pieces... and put them on my dummies. People would say, "Too bad it doesn't fit me, you only sell clothes for skinny people." I put on a piece and took a picture. God, I was modeling. I took a picture and sold three pieces that day. I thought, "Wow, now they believe it." [Alessandra in Portuguese] We grant "artisanal" credit. We go to our client's home, to their business, have coffee with them, analyze their business. The money is the last part. First, there's the rapport, the service, the advisory. Money is the tool, not the goal. We created a model so we could be different, to be a humane bank, to look people in the eye. If we wanted to be a traditional financial institution, we wouldn't have built this model. What we are doing at the bank is looking at some retailers... OPPORTUNITY AGENT - PÉROLA BANK ...and coming up with a pattern to help everyone get organized the same way, to help you manage your business. [indistinct chattering] [Alessandra] The main difference between Pérola Bank and traditional banks is our business model. You won't find a revolving door or a manager wearing a tie here. No, we are young people who go to the community, we have a very open office. So we have a different business model. The public we serve is not the one that typically goes to traditional financial institutions. I held everything and rang the doorbell. I thought I'd go through a revolving door. Someone came, said, "Good morning! How are you?" and hugged me. I thought, "Well, there's no beeping," so I got in. I sat down, had some coffee. It was completely different. I said, "Gosh." This year, we had an unexpected challenge. We were approached by drug dealers and loan sharks from a specific neighborhood. It was such a shock. We try to help the community and we had that problem, it was a very clear threat that we were going over their business. We came to the conclusion that we really were. Because we lent 500,000 reais to that specific community. A loan shark's average interest rate is from ten percent to 40 percent per month, depending on the loan shark. You just have to do some math and see how much we took from them. But we decided to keep on doing it because if we caused that trouble, it's because we are really doing something good. It was a market threat. We annoyed our main competitor. I still have an active account on another bank, but when it comes to loans, I couldn't even manage, thinking of the interest rates and how difficult it would be. I couldn't. I even tried, but I couldn't manage. Because with other banks, they lack a lot. We do a lot as legal entities. They want a lot from us as legal entities. But they forget there is an entrepreneur behind that legal entity. Pérola Bank wants us to be real entrepreneurs. We often try to impose certain things. "You'll have your business, it will thrive, you'll have a branch, you'll make more money, then open another branch." But nobody asks if that is what entrepreneurs really want, if that is what will make them happy. Many times, we tried to propose these things and they said, "That's not what I want. I want to keep my store here, I have a good life here, I can take care of my child. I don't need that." I can't see my store anywhere else. I picture a mezzanine floor, and a really long wall, a huge clothes storage, with a really nice place for kids' clothes on the top floor. I even dream of a playground for the kids so their moms can be left alone and spend a lot of money. Mothers love having a place where they can leave their kids. ONLY 53% OF THE LOW-INCOME POPULATION HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS, WHICH PREVENTS THEM FROM HAVING ACCESS TO LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES. Traditional capitalism to me is the one that looks at companies as tools for profiting. That's all. Once profit is a priority, obviously, anything goes when you're trying to profit. Then we realize that anything goes indeed. So it's okay for them to ruin the environment, it's okay having terrible work conditions, it's okay having a product that won't actually help the consumer, because the main goal is to profit. That's all. That's what we've been seeing for a really long time. Profit comes first, no matter what your goal is, how much pressure you're under, your quality of life, nothing. What matters is to profit. I believe in a more conscious capitalism. Ours is a capitalist model, too, but it is a conscious capitalism. Profiting is good, it creates sustainability, but not at all costs. PÉROLA BANK HERE YOUR DREAM HAS CREDIT PÉROLA CREDIT ASSOCIATION FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR [in Portuguese] The solutions to these problems are not simple. But I feel I'm part of the problem and I think the most obvious problems, like social inequality, like climate change, are the most complicated ones because no one is against them. Everyone believes they are problems, but people don't feel they are part of that problem. We need a crucial change to be able to have empathy and see others. What really worries me is that society and ourselves as human beings become numb over time from living with that reality. [in English] We created a system, a theoretical framework, a conceptual framework where we put profit at the center stage. Everything is organized around that one issue, the profit. So we design businesses which are all geared to making profit, maximization of profit. And we have no other idea. And the whole world followed that framework, and converted ourselves into money-making people. We are chasing money because that's the goal of all our lives. So we are chasing people, money has become the king who controls everything. So we become addicted to the money. We forgot why we're doing that. What is the meaning of money? Money is supposed to be means, not an end. Now it became an end, it became a controller of our life. Should money control our life or we should control the money? That we forgot. And as a result, we became... A whole population of the world became some kind of robots, money-chasing robots. So we forgot what human beings mean to us. The human being is a much bigger entity than being robots. Human beings are creative beings. When you say robot, you take away the creative part of it. You do the repetitive part, that's what the robot is all about. You are programmed and you do that. We are not programmed people. We design our own programs, we design our own life. That's why the educational institutions are telling their young people, "Work hard, get the best degree, and get the best job in the best company." That's the robotic kind of part. We should be telling the students and young people, "Find out-- You learn all these math, science and literature, everything. But the essential thing, you find out what is the purpose of your life."
