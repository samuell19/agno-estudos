present Digitally remastered with the support of PART 2 Welcome, dear Carolyne. Thank you for your kind reception. How was your trip? The escape from Russia was like a bad dream. But your kindness makes up for everything. And I feel like a human being at last. And free. Yes, a forced marriage must be hard to bear. So they say and so I've read. Enjoy yourselves in Weimar. Thank you, Your Highness. As your residence I offer you Altenburg. You will soon feel at home there. And if our friend Liszt calls on you... Call on her? You see, my brother has replied to my letter... He consents, surely? I would be happy if it was so. He refused? The Tsar, though kindly, can be adamant, too. With me, he usually is the latter. I'm afraid you've chosen a bad advocate. I will fight. I will fight till... You like fighting for others, don't you? Now you'll have to fight for your own happiness. So. We'll be torn apart? Oh no. But these are hard times. In Europe revolutions are raging. So, if we agreed to your living together... we would legalize something that... - Your Highness has never been strict. - Now I must be. As Your Highness wishes. The ministry has proved to be entirely ineffective. So the ministry can go to hell. The sooner we see their behinds, the better. Who would have thought that Mr. Wagner was one of us? He bawled me out like hell because the stage door got stuck. He is very strict. As to the king, in the person of Friedrich August IV, he hasn't answered for anything, so he couldn't do much harm. The will of the people is the noblest principle. Let him be faithful to it as long as he is king. No, no, gentlemen. I want to hear the melody. The accompaniment should hold back. Once more, please. Right from the beginning. Ten minutes rest, gentlemen. There is trouble. The revolution in Dresden... Succumbed. Like in Vienna and Pest. There's a warrant for my arrest. If I get caught, well... And Minna? I fled alone. Fancy my wife coming with me. She doesn't like restless souls. At the premiere of Tannhauser the Grand Duke offered me a post here as second conductor or as third at the worst. Things have changed in Germany. But I'll talk to the Grand Duke. Meanwhile, you'll be my guest. No good. It can't be done. Why not? The German princes have agreed to extradite fugitive rebels. Are they going to extradite me? No. But you'd better leave the Grand Duchy, though it will be risky. I wish our interest were as well guarded as our sovereigns. But I will present Lohengrin, even if there will be a world wide scandal. Liszt's person is to be spared. How shall we recognize Wagner? He wouldn't take a step without his beret. Richard Wagner. You're under arrest. I'm the court music director, Franz Liszt. Franz Liszt! You don't say. What do you want, gentlemen? Where is Wagner? I don't know. Gone. Let's go. It's all right. Thank God. I don't like restless souls. Your Majesty, Hungary is lying at your feet. Thank you, Duke. Our faithful subjects will be rewarded. Missus, when will the wedding be? Are you going to invite us, too? You'll look pretty as a bride. - Isn't she elegant? - From her daughter's money. When will the wedding be? On May 40th. Aren't you interested in what's happened? What happened? They insult me continually. They humiliate me. Why have you deserted me, why, my Lord? Princess... I would be extremely pleased if I could promote your cause. I would be grateful. I requested Baron Maltitz to be present in his official capacity as the Tstar's envoy in Weimar. I want to state officially that I'm willing to divorce you. Don't be surprised. Years have passed since you left Woronince. Meanwhile, my situation has changed, too. Yes, I know. So, I should like to see this matter settled. So would I, believe me. Consider yourself a free man. Officially too. Let us discuss a few important details. For instance, our daughter. Let's discuss the future of Marie Sayn-Wittgenstein. Masha's future? You don't want to take away my child? Considering your present position, I'm afraid society would take it amiss if our daughter stayed with you. Further, the child's fortune, the estate... Yes, of course, the estate... I'm ready to discuss everything. It shall be as you wish. I only... I knew you would not raise any difficulties, so we had a draught prepared. We, the undersigned, Prince Sayn-Wittgenstein and his wife Carolyne, have agreed to the following. Nicky has agreed to the divorce. I'll go to Rome and press for a marriage licence. Isn't that asking too much? We should be more modest. No, Franz. We must obtain pardon for our grave sin. What sin? Yes, for the sin. Do you think adultery is a Christian virtue? A safe conduct to the other world? You've never spoken like this before. The Holy Father's assent means pardon for us. And then, holy matrimony... For me, this is now the only way. I'll go to Rome. My marriage has been invalidated by the Pope. Come at once! We'll be wed on your 50th birthday. This is it. San Carlo al Corso... They'll be waiting for us tomorrow morning. I wanted it to be on your birthday. There'll be masses of flowers in our honour... Dear Carolyne... A poor organist. Very average. But a lovely melody, an old Gregorian chant. Have you never thought that this might be your true vocation? Sacred music? Yes, often. Modern man's faith has not yet found expression. There is much to be done in this field. One... two... three... four... five... six... Six o'clock. Another 14 hours How can I bear it? What's 14 hours after so many years? Cardinal Honelohe. Do show him in. Welcome. Please, take a seat. All is ready for the wedding. We thought you would come in the morning. The Sayn-Wittgenstein family has laid convincing proof before the Holy See that the Princess was not forced to marry Prince Nicholas. The marriage of both parties was voluntarily created. His Holiness now has doubts as to the justness of his decision. But he has given his consent! His Holiness thinks it is the will of the Lord. And what do you think? Why has the Lord changed his will? In the interest of your salvation. It is your salvation maybe, that of the Princess's family or the wealth and rank of the Hohenlohes which is endangered by a Gipsy musician. Please Carolyne, try to check these words against His Highness's decision... Mr. Liszt whom we so greatly honour... Honour! Please, Carolyne. Believe me, it's better for all. Living in sin is unworthy of you. What is worthy of me? The life of a Christian, who is above the vanities of this world. A Christian life of penance. We do not mean that but appeasement, acquiescence... Thank you, Father. Don't touch me, please. I will beg His Holiness... No! God is punishing me because I violated His laws. I must do penance for my sins as long as I live. Forever. I'll find comfort in religion. Do not touch me! You see, the bars! I was unable to break them, though I wanted so much to get out of my prison. But it's impossible. And I shall be a prisoner forever. Do not accuse yourself. Those bars were forged by the world. When both of us live behind bars maybe our souls will find peace. It is very modest, of course. It suits me. I hope my playing won't disturb the brethren. You are free to play for most of the day. Surely, we shall find much pleasure in it. Excuse our intruding. You have distinguished visitors. We, the Prince of the Church, visit the Prince of Music. Holy Father! We hear you were working on an ecclesiastical composition. I have finished the Legend of St. Elisabeth, and I'm working on my Oratorio on our Lord. We'd like to help you in your creative work, but we know Franz Liszt and the dangers that threaten him. The dangers which threaten the artist. Talent is a treasure threatened by robbers. Is Liszt doing his utmost to return what he owes to God, safely and enriched, to the Lender? I believe so, Holy Father. His intentions are pure, no doubt. I've composed my Grand Mass, the Legend of St. Elisabeth. I'm working on my Oratorio. They and many others speak in my favour. Do they not reflect my ideal? Liszt composed his Orpheus, Prometheus, Tasso, Mazeppa, his Dante and Faust symphonies, too. And they, too, reflect his ideals. We do not disapprove of those excellent works. It would not be befitting to interfere with the musicians' disputes. It is no sin if Man, God's creature, chooses paragons of human greatness as inspiration for his works. We would only like to remark that the Grand Mass and Orpheus speak in the same voice. Am I expected to be two people to speak in two different languages? We only object to the tone of the Mass being that of Orpheus instead of being the very reverse. Franz Liszt sings about Christendom, giving voice, however, to all worldly ideals. To what they call the thoughts of our age. To the so called freedom of the people, which should be rather called the unhappiness of the people. The genius of Franz Liszt is the genius of our sad and declining century. For what Liszt lacks or has been lacking is the requisite steadfastness. True? Franz Liszt? He is believed to be triumphant and happy. But we know that he is unhappy. As if he were standing outside his own life not living it, just looking at it, dreaming about it, with detachment, somewhat critically, somewhat bitterly, somewhat mincingly... That is why, in the midst of ovations, he always remains aloof and lonely. Remember that it is not the Austrian Emperor but the King of Hungary who will be crowned. Both are impersonated by Francis Joseph I. As Austrian Emperor he ruled Hungary from Vienna. This is just what has changed. Even if you don't realize it, He'll be King of independent Hungary with Buda as his seat. So the court of Vienna has no say in this matter. It's a Hungarian affair. And the people want Liszt's Coronation Mass, otherwise there will be gaps in their rows. He wrote the mass at the request of the Hungarian prince primate. All right, dear Baron, but... let Mr. Preyer conduct Mr. Liszt's work. Compromise, eternal compromise... Your invitation card, sir. Sorry, I haven't got one. I only want to hear my Coronation Mass. Sorry, I can't allow you further. I see. So the Hungarian musician won't hear the work he has composed for the crowning of the King. All right, sir. Turn back. Stop. Maestro, pardon me. I'm a Hungarian and much ashamed of myself. With your permission, I'll accompany you. Sorry, not that way. Well, thank you. Long live the King! Long live the King! Long live Ferenc Liszt! Where's the King? I want to see him. - Is that the King over there? - Yes, dear, he is the King. May I ask who was just playing the piano? My lodger, sir. That old priest is her teacher. You come from abroad, don't you? Where can I find the old priest? Wait, please. Vera! I'm here. Excuse me... I'm Alexander Borodin from St. Petersburg. And I'm Vera Timanova from Moscow. And Franz Liszt's pupil here in Weimar. - You are looking for him, aren't you? - Yes, yes. Come, I'll show you the way. Thank you very much. Sit down, please. You are a chemist? Can a brain hold two sciences so unlike? When... where did you find your technique? I mean, as a composer? In one of the German conservatories? I never finished my studies at the conservatory. Luckily, dear friend, I, too, was kicked out of the Paris conservatory. Do you know the German conservatories? Today's German music? They go on and on composing. If music were water, it would flood Mount Ararat. Noah's pigeon could not alight on it. What would I give for a singe new thought! And you bring along masses of new thoughts from the East. I come from the East, too, I'm Hungarian. Your talent is unique. Work as your genius dictates you. Thank you. But aren't you overrating my music? Certainly not. I'm not complimenting you. I'd never call bad music good. But this is excellent! I'm not talking about the results, but about the course you've taken. Your little circle of four or five friends. The Group of the Strong. A good name, full of confidence. You're approaching the crystal clear spring again. You mean folk music? The riches and the virginal purity that are latent in all folk music. Your greatest merit is in having realized this. If only you would visit us again. But I think not. I'm old and tired. But you should come to see me. Send your works, come in person. I'm linked to your town by so many memories. And by what memories! Miss Olga Janina, from the Ukraine. Olga? Not Oleg? So you are the "Monsieur" who was writing to me? I'm Claudia Venturi. Quiet good. Bach. Though there are parts I'd play differently. Why are you looking at me? Are you comparing me to my old picture? Yes. You're more fascinating now. Well, if it's music you are interested in, come next Tuesday. Where do all these parcels come from? Composers send them in the hope the Maestro will play them. Or study them. Let's stop, dear. You are absent minded. You've never played so badly before. You are troubled, I think, by the dissonances of springtide. I can't go home, drenched as I am. Come in. You'll find dry things in there, go and change. I have loved you for long years. I love you madly, mortally, hopelessly. All I want is for you to love me. For you to take me in your arms, so that I can feel what blissful love is like. You shouldn't have come. Why do you expose me to repentance and shame? You will have nothing to repent. In what state of mind should I wake up then? Try and see. God didn't think about old age, but he gave us harmony as a solace, in which there is also wisdom, not only love. My wild, distant country. I deserted you. Will you take your prodigal, restless son? For there is nothing left for me, only you. And no fidelity except my fidelity to you. And I'll fulfil my task as I once promised you in those happy, ecstatic days. My wild, distant country. Will you give me a haven where I can find myself at last? Mr. Trefort, the Minister of Education. Show his Excellency in. Forgive this unexpected visit. It's a pleasure and an honour. Please, take a seat. This is a formal visit to the President of the new Academy of Music. At last! The baby was born, if a little late. But we must not rake up the past. Our Academy is headed by the world's leading musician. His Majesty sent me to inform you about your nomination. Oh, I wish I were younger, to be able to help with the new task. So you do accept the nomination? Yes, Your Excellency. My beloved Pest-Buda has taken wing at last. She has a National Theatre, and an Academy of Music... But my future pupils shall not pay! I have never taught for money, nor shall I now. I'll divide me time. Pest, Weimar, Rome... Franz Liszt... Show him in. Franz! What brings you here? I don't know. Here I am. Please, sit down. You are embarrassed. No wonder. I have aged, and grown ugly. This secluded life does not suit you. Why don't you open your house to the world? To the best society of Rome? I'm afraid, dear friend, our points of view differ more than they used to. You showed me the road leading to the world of new, modern music. And now, when this music... And now, this music has degenerated, too. Like everything in this wretched century. I've always felt it was my century. Yours... Don't you realize you do not exist anymore? That you exist for the sake of others only? Wagner, Cornelius, Berlioz, and your other 'geniuses' You said, I had opened the gate for you. May I ask, then, where your place will be in the history of music? Liszt, the uncle of modern music who leaves his wealth to others, who use it against him, like Mr. Wagner did. And in alliance, with your own daughter, too. Please, please... You came to see me, my friend. I didn't ask you here. You are right. I have come to see you, and not for the last time, I think. Yes, I hope to see you again. The trouble is that you will see me. Fate at least should have spared me from growing old in this evil, hideous way. The seconds may be evil and hideous, the years are pure and wonderful. Good-bye, Carolyne. Come again, Franz. If fate permits, we'll meet again. Good-bye. You didn't come to meet me. Why did you visit all your friends in Europe, while we were having Wagner celebrations here? My friends... who knows if I shall see them again? Come now, Father, You've never liked Bayreuth, not even in poor Richard's lifetime. Don't try to find excuses, Cosima. I do not expect filial affection from you. How could you? As a child, I was distant from you. In later years, you were cross with me. You are right. Domestic happiness has been denied to me. I wanted you to have more of it. I thought you'd find it with B?low, rather than in the cold pomp of Wahnfried, at the side of a much older man. You were friends with Richard until... Say it, Cosima, go on, you are my daughter. Wagner outshone me and I am jealous. No, I wouldn't say you were jealous, but... But... But? You are ill, Father. You should go to bed. Come, I'll take you to your lodgings. To my lodgings? Am I not to stay with you? With a kind old lady near here. This would be too noisy for you. Too many guests. As you wish, my child. Mishka, we're going. Mishka, what's happening? People are coming out of the theatre. But I should have been there! Tomorrow, your honour. No! My daughter wanted me to... She knows that you are unwell. Does Richard know, too? But Mr. Wagner... more than 3 years ago... Richard? 3 years ago? They are applauding. No, they are coming out of the theatre. Oh, why are they leaving us alone? Quick! A doctor! They're applauding. Mr. Colonne should be told that... No, don't. Better not... I'll go and bow as is befitting. Heavens! You mustn't! Help! The restlessness of Faustian man chased him across the world, to find abode in a distant dream town, and repose in humaneness to come. Out of the disquiet quiet of his grave, the Faustian struggle of the future will sprout and drive on his disciples as well, until the time of humanity's happiness. This is the work of Ferenc Liszt. Let the Faust symphony resound.
