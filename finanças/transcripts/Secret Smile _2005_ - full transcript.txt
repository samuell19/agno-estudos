Let me get this straight. You're suggesting that your brother-in-law to be had some kind of bad influence on Troy? Yes. In my flat, before... before, he said, "He's right, you don't give a shit about us." I mean, why would he say that? He was so wound up as if someone had been on at him, goading him. According to Mr Block, they were in the park in the morning. Sounds harmless. Yeah, but what were they talking about? I mean, what was he saying to him? He was living in your flat with your sister, yes? Yeah. Is there some kind of issue between you and Mr Block? Look, I don't like him very much, but you know. "Troy actively sought me out. He wanted to be with me." Must have been hard. Your brother's feeling bad. Instead of talking to you, he confides in this bloke that you don't like. I believe Brendan encouraged Troy to stop seeing his therapist, to stop taking his medication. Maybe he did. Maybe he was trying to help and got it wrong. It was Troy's decision. Miranda, Troy was a completely different person when he was depressed. He loved you. He wouldn't have wanted to hurt you. Well, he's dead now. How do we know what he would have wanted? There are some things we'll never understand. Troy doing what he did is one of them. Yeah. He's right. You are drinking too much. Who's right? Brendan rang me. He said you went to your mum's and were sloshed. What business is it of his? He's worried about you. Everybody is, Miranda. - What? - He wants to make peace. Hang on a minute. - How did he get your phone number? - I gave it to him at the funeral. - Whose side are you on? - Look, it's not a question of sides. Come on. I know he's been a complete prick in the past, I do, but he's genuinely cut up about Troy. Nothing is genuine with Brendan. If you keep this feud up, you won't see your family. Because he's wormed his way in. The one good thing that could come out of this is that you and Brendan can make friends. What's the matter with you? Nothing. - You're quite an unforgiving person. - No, I'm not. If you and I fell out, I hope we'd make up. Of course we would. I just want my friend back. I'm here. It's sort of a wedding present. Not really... Anyway. - Thank you. - Thanks, Mirrie. Oh, they're lovely. - A bit grown-up. - They're perfect. They'll look great in our new home... wherever it is. Actually, because of everything, we've cancelled the church wedding. We'll have it at the registry office. And then just have family and friends back here. Top-ups all round, I think. (WHISPERS) Thank you. - Can I help at all? - I think I'm all right, thanks. - Let me do that. - Sure. Thanks for being so good with my parents. It's the least I can do. They've been very good to me. Kerry looks better. Yeah. She still misses him. We all do. I just wanted to say er... ...sorry things have been so difficult between us. Water under the bridge. There was a time when I was a bit messed up about you, but I've moved on. I'm glad to hear it. You're getting married. Oh, and we need a witness for the registry office. Kerry thought you'd say no. No, I'll do it. I'd love to. That's great. Thank you. Miranda's going to be our witness. Really? Fantastic. Thank you. Pleasure. Well... here's to the wedding. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hello. What's the matter? The wedding's off. What? Brendan phoned five minutes ago. Oh, my God. - Where's Kerry? - In the garden. Oh, Mum. Oh, Kerry. I'm so sorry. I bet you must be pleased. You finally got what you wanted. Don't be silly. What a laugh, to dump me on my wedding day. No doubt you encouraged them, didn't you? What are you talking about? Oh, God, don't pretend you don't know. It's Laura. What? Brendan's left me for Laura. Laura, what the fuck is going on? Get in the house. I'll deal with this. - Laura, have you any idea how upset Kerry is? - Just go away. Get off. I don't understand. What's happening? Miranda... Laura and I got married this morning. New, ge eme - Got you a pint. - Thanks. Oh, Tony. I just don't believe it. Came back from work and er... ...she told me to pack my stuff. I thought she was joking. Did you have any idea? She went out a lot. Said she was with you. - Your bloody Brendan. - He's not my Brendan. He's promised her everything she thinks she wants. Marriage and kids. Everything I was too crap to offer her. Oh, Tony, I'm so sorry. They're off on honeymoon now. Her mum told me. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do without her? (SOBS) Oh... I did a conservatory for her sister. Now she wants one the same, only bigger. It's not a huge job, but we need an architect to take us through the planning. - I could put your name forward. - Absolutely. How quick could you get the plans? I can draw them up in three weeks, ready to submit. I'll speak to her this afternoon, if you like. - Brilliant. Thanks. Sorry. (MOBILE RINGS) Hello? Hello Mirarnda it's Laura Hello. I krnow whnat I did was really awful arnd I'm very sorry but erm I do rneed to see you Carn you meet me tornighnt at thne Draytorn about eighnt o'clock? - OK. - Thnarnks What are you doing here? Where's Laura? Don't try to break up my marriage. It's pathetic. - She rang me. - And vindictive. Why isn't she here? She doesn't want to see you. We're happy. She's happy. Like Kerry was until you dumped her. - Like Troy was until he met you. - Hey. I loved your brother. - Bullshit. You just used him to get at me. - I did all I could for him and your sister. But I couldn't keep supporting your family. I have to think of myself for once, my needs. You never think of anyone else. You couldn't if you tried. You'd know. - Because you're the same. - I'm not like you. Poor wee Mirrie. You got more than you bargained for when you met me, didn't you? Sad, isn't it, how things have gone downhill for you? You've lost so much. While I seem to have done rather well. Might as well stay for a drink. Join me? Are you paying with your money or Laura's? Laura's, of course. It's wonderful. I've got you to thank for that. It's because of you we met. At Troy's funeral. I've got you to thank for so much. Anyone fancy a game of pool? (LAUGHTER) That was a fluke. (RINGING TONE) Thne persorn you are callirng is (DOORBELL) Hello? Laura? Hello? Laura? Hello? OK. Laura? Laura? Hello? Laura? (SCREAMS) Pretend we didn't see that. - You're getting your money's worth. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. We've um... We've got the post-mortem results back. It was definitely an accident. There are no marks on her body, no sign of ligatures or a struggle of any sort. I don't believe it. She was very drunk. She must have run a bath, got in and passed out. Well, couldn't he have got her drunk and put her in the bath? No. There's no forensic evidence of that. But he's very clever. Maybe he didn't leave any! My DI gave him a right going over. She's sure he's telling the truth. So, that's it? You're just not going to do anything again? Well, what do you want me to do? I don't know, but you could at least talk to him, couldn't you? It's not my call. You've got to do something. All right. I'll erm... I'll get another statement. - Check the forensic evidence again. - I'll get a statement. - It doesn't make any sense. - I'll ring you, OK? OK. We have come here today to remember before God our sister Laura. To give thanks for her life, to commend her to God, our merciful redeemer and judge, to commit her body to be buried, and to comfort one another in our grief. # PACHEBEL: Canon We have entrusted our sister Laura to God's mercy and we now commit her body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our frail bodies, that they may be conformed to his glorious body. I'm leaving London. VICAR: Was buried and rose again for us. Everywhere I go, I see her face. VICAR: Amen. I can't bear it any more. I have to find out what happened. I have to. What's it matter now? Mirarnda we hnavern't seern you for ages Why don't you come back with us now? I can't. I've got things I've got to do. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'll see you soon. Thanks for coming. - Take care of yourself. - And you. Brerntford Police Statiorn Can I speak to Rob Pryor, please? Who s ca ng? M raneda Cetten I'm afraid Cornstable Pryor's rnot hnere at thne momernt Do you know when he'll be back? Maybe thnis afterrnoorn - Will you ask him to give me a call? - Yes OK. Bye. Rob! Rob! Erm... just hold on. I'll be a minute. Hi. Have you spoken to him? You didn't tell me you had a past history with him. - I don't. - You went out with him. For ten days. You tried to break up his relationship with your sister. You lied about him to his mates. No, I didn't. When I interviewed him, he immediately knew it was you pushing me. Luckily, he agreed not to tell my DI. There's nothing to tell. Yes, there is. I was out of line and he knew it. He said you'd do anything to get at him. It's not true. Witnesses at the Drayton say you hit him so hard he could have pressed charges. - For fuck's sake! - You're being paranoid. I could charge you with wasting police time. I've just been to Laura's funeral. She was my best friend. I'm sorry. I just wanna know what happened. Rob! Hi, it's Mick. You still all right for that meeting tomorrow? Erm... I can't do tomorrow. You said you'd hnave thne plarns by thnis week Can you give me a few more days? No, she's going away on holiday Friday. Look, I'm sorry, Mick. I've just had a lot on. Dorn't worry I'll just hnave to reschnedule thne job Sorry Mirarnda (HORN BEEPS) Selling up? That's a shame. I thought you loved the place. - Or can't you afford it any more? - What do you want? Laura's stuff. It's all yours. I sold the house. Got a fair whack for it. So I'm off. You've got what you wanted. You'll never have to see me any more. You bastard! Best for everyone. For me, and for you. Bye, Mirrie. I'll always remember you. As always it's about morney You may fool othnerpeople Brerndarn but you dorn't fool me It is withn great sadrness I hnave to say I rno lornger cornsideryou a brothner Try to move orn as I hnave Susarn Breathe out. (BONES CRUNCH) Breathe out. That should do the trick. Did you work in Scotland before you set up down here? I've been here for years. Trained here, the lot. You've still got the accent, though. - Is it Edinburgh? - No. It's not Glasgow, anyway. I'm from the back of beyond. Loch Etive. I went on holiday to Loch Etive. You didn't? You know Kirkdale Cross, the Oban side? Kirkdale Cross? I don't think so. See? I told you. Middle of nowhere, where nothing happens and nobody goes. But you got out. I certainly did. That should do the trick. Any problems, give me a phone. And your brother? He got out too? He did. Look, I know Brendan. I wanted to talk to you about him. Look, I don't know where he is. We don't see each other. Whatever it is you want from him, I'd let it drop. Why? He's better left to his own devices. You owe me f40. And your parents? Does he still see them? They died. Oh, I'm sorry. How? A fire. It was an accident. I don't want to talk about it. Leave the money on the side. He's called Lawrence and he's a junior hospital manager. And he's nice. Excellent. Are you seeing anyone? Not at the moment, no. - Thanks. - How's work? Fine, thanks, yeah. Are you all right? It's just, you haven't seen Mum and Dad for ages. - Or me. - Sorry. Yeah, I'm fine. Erm... Did you know that Brendan's parents died in a fire? His mum died of cancer, he told me. He was lying. - I know because I met his sister. - He didn't have a sister. She's called Susan. She's an osteopath. Why are you doing this? If I can get a better picture of his past, then maybe the police would listen. When he walked out, I wanted to blame you, Laura, but... ...really, it was him. He never loved me. He used me to get at you, and... if someone can do that, they can do anything. Please, Miranda. Just leave it. - What are you doing here? - What do you think? How did you get in? Your friendly estate agent showed me round. You still keep the spare key in the same place. How did you find out about this? I met your sister. I had a bad back. Oh, very good. You keep your nose out of my business. Enough! Understand? I once fell for you, but you're not invulnerable. I have got a new life. I've got my own business now. People sit up when they see me. My girlfriend adores me. I will not let you ruin that. Understand? I walked away from you. Time that you walked away from me. - Bradley arnd Wrern Property Agernts - Hello? - Can I speak to John, please? - Whno's callirng? - Miranda Cotton. - Orne momernt - Hi Mirarnda It's Johnrn - Hi.

See - Can you please leave? - I just wish someone had warned me. - He'll become possessive and jealous. - Get out. He doesn't tell the truth about anything, you have to understand. I know him. - I think he's a dangerous person. - Oh, is he? - Or are you just jealous? - Please listen to me. He used other people to get at me. Has he told you about Troy? - Yes. - What about Laura? Please listen to me. It's only me! I forgot my phone. Please. My God, you must have worked hard to find me. Poor wee Mirrie. When I think of what you used to be and what you are now. Get out. You won't get away with it again, Brendan. Get off me. Goodbye, Miranda. You all right, babe? Yeah. What did she say? Nothing. Just... ridiculous stuff. She's mad, isn't she? It's awful. Don't worry. I won't let it happen again. - But I've got to go. - Yeah. See you later, all right? Bye. I'm streaming with a cold. I walk into a health-food shop... (NASALLY) It was so bad, he was talking like this. (INTERCOM BUZZES) Can you get that, Mum, please? And then there's a vision of loveliness. Hello? Yeah. Bring it up. Top floor. Flat 8. Who is it, Mum? Delivery for you. We live nearby, so we bumped into each other that night in the pub. Yeah? It was odd. We got chatting, and then erm... Delivery for Miranda Cotton? - I'll take it. - I need to deliver it personally. Don't tell her I told you that. Who here is Miranda Cotton? I am. Thanks very much. We found out we lived round the corner from each other. Very strange. It's all right. Weird. Darling? Is everything all right? I don't believe it. What is it? Oh, I told you to leave him alone. If anyone should take out an injunction, it's me. He came in here and took the key. - What's happening? - Brendan's taking Miranda to court. You have, according to Mr Block, and he has witnesses, harassed him ceaselessly since he ended the relationship with you nine months ago. When he started a relationship with your sister, you caused such tension that he decided to break all ties with your family. - After his new wife died... - In suspicious circumstances. ...you slandered him to a police constable. Fearing for his safety, Mr Block moved. You discovered his new address, - forced entry upon Naomi Stone. - It wasn't like that. Did Miss Cotton intimidate you, Miss Stone? Yeah. Do you have any explanation? I just wanted to see if she was all right. I'll keep this injunction in place for six months. If you break it, it will be contempt of court, punishable by possible imprisonment. Thank you so much. Nor do I condone your behaviour, Mr Block. The court will review this case in six months. In the meantime, I hope to see neither of you here again. - Are you OK? - This is a nightmare. The bed was beautifully made. He'd pulled back the sheets, put a chocolate and a rose on it. The bathroom was all candlelit, with bubble bath. - How lovely is that? - All done by the time I got home. It was really sweet. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) - Is that yours? - Yeah. Hello? It's Naomi Hi, Naomi. I've beern thnirnkirng We shnould talk Sure. When? Brerndarn's out all morrnirng Come over OK. Are you all right? What did she want? She wants me to go to their flat tomorrow morning. You can't. I mean... What if it's a trap? What if Brendan's there? You go anywhere near him, you could go to prison. No, I'll just have to be careful. She sounded really upset. Leave it. It's difficult, but I've moved on. So should you. I feel like I'm standing on a riverbank, watching someone drown. I can't do it. - Security - I'm here to see Naomi Stone, Flat 23. Righnt you are Hello? See you later. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) Hello? - Get out of thnere Mirarnda - What? Meet me at thne ernd of thne road She's made our life a misery. Well, we'll have a word with her, sir. - What the hell's going on? - Sorry. He made me call you. Well, get in! Look, you were right about him. Since the day you came, he completely changed. Last night, he locked me in the bathroom all night, just cos I talked to a mate on the phone. He says if I ever leave, he'll punish me the way he punished you. Does he hit you? Nothing that'll show. He's careful. (SIGHS) I'm just so scared. I don't know what I'm going to do. Go to the police. They didn't believe you. They're not going to believe me. Anyway, he'll come after me. You know him. Well, you'll have to go back there tonight, so he doesn't suspect anything - until we figure out where you can go. OK. Ooh! Where have you been? Someone called in sick. I had to cover. So, how did it go with Miranda? When we got here, she was gone. Maybe we should just leave it at that. You've got the court order. I doubt she'll come back again. Ow! Did you warn her? Of course not. (INTERCOM BUZZES) Oh, could you get that, Kerry? Hello? M raneda? No, ts Kerry ers ster Can I speak to Miranda? It's Naomi Stone. - Er... yeah, it's just we're sort of... - It's kirnd of urgernt Hold on. Come on up. She's in the lounge. Are you all right? I know you told me to stay put, but he's got much worse. He's going through my e-mails, texts, everything. Oh, my God. Does he know you've gone? No, but he will when he gets home. - Can I stay here? - Sure. No. No, this is the first place he'll look. Can't you stay with your parents or? Ne, t ey mevveed te Aust ra a, ages age - What about your place, Kerry? - Er... yeah. Sure. - Well, I don't want to impose. - No. No, it's... fine. Right. I'll get these. - Are you not coming in? - No. Mick's coming, to take my stuff to storage. Come straight back. - See you later. - OK. All right. Kerry, it's me. Mick's been delayed, so I'm going to stay here tonight. Don't worry about me. It'll be fine. Honestly. Look I'll call you by nine o'clock tomorrow morning. OK? Look, thanks so much for this. Bye-bye. - Where's Naomi? - How should I know? She's not here. Don't be stupid. You've been in contact, haven't you? Comparing notes. Why would I do that? She tried to set me up. Here, have a drink. You want to lighten up, Brendan. You don't want to lose control. Cheers. So, where are you going to live? Erm... I'm going to stay with my mum and dad for a bit. No house, no job, no boyfriend. I'll survive. You said that when you chucked me out. Still here. Just. I was thinking on the way, do I regret meeting you or not? And do you? No. Although you have pushed me into some stuff I wouldn't normally do. Like what? You know. Do you remember that first night I came here? Do you remember? We couldn't get enough of each other. I remember. It was good, wasn't it? What are you doing here? What do you want? I came to say goodbye. Get off me! Oh, Mirrie... you don't mean that. Yes, I do. No! Get off! No! No! - Mirrie, sh! - Argh! No! - Sh-sh-sh! - Stop it! No! (SCREAMS) No! Yes! That's it. (SOBS) Sh! Sh! (CRIES) Stop it. Arrrgh! (CRIES SOFTLY) (WHIMPERS) Mirrie! Go away! Go away! Get off me! Go away! Argh! (SOBS) I can't let you go, Miranda. Argh! Get away! Get away! (SCREAMS PIERCINGLY) Is there a lot there, Mick? No. Just some small stuff today. Taking it to her parents' place in Ealing. - Didn't finish till nine last night. - I had a late one, too. Miranda? She said she'd be here this morning. Blimey. Must have been some party. It's gone straight to voicemail. I suppose we'd better make a start. Just going for a quick piss. (KNOCKS ON DOOR) Shit. Oh, this is Naomi, a friend of Miranda's. Erm... you haven't heard from Miranda? She hasn't popped round? - That'll be her now. - Probably. She just said she'd call and she's not answering her phone. Mr Cotton. DC Rob Pryor. Do you remember me? We had a call from a Mr Mick Mason this morning. He had an arrangement to meet your daughter at her flat and she didn't turn up. Well, where is she? I mean, she was supposed to have moved her stuff out of the flat today. - She can't just have disappeared. - I'm sure there's no need to worry. - People go missing... - No, it's Brendan. Brendan? He told me last week that if I left him... ...he'd come after me. He'd know where I'd gone and he'd find us and kill us both. Morning, Rob. - Mr Brendan Block? - Yeah? I'm Detective Inspector Jean Holmes. May we come in? Brendan Block, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Miranda Cotton. - Miranda? - You don't have to say anything, - but it may harm your defence... - What's happened? - That should do it. Can you do the bags? - Yeah, one by one. - Cuff him. - I need to speak to my lawyer. Hold your hands up, sir, please. Rob, what the fuck is going on here? Rob, will you sort out the interview room? Tell me when it's ready. I'll get the paperwork. Right. Let's get started, shall we? This interview is being taped at Brentford Police Station. The time is 17:10. Now, Mr Block, can you tell me what happened last night? - I went to her flat. - How did you get in? She let me in. She was moving out. I thought it would be friendly to say goodbye. We drank wine. Things progressed from there. What exactly do you mean by that? We had sex, which she instigated. Where? In her living room. I crashed out afterwards, I woke up, she was gone. Gone? She wasn't in the flat. Didn't you find that a bit strange? She's an unpredictable person. I got up and left. We found blood... on the carpet in the bathroom. A lot of it. Can you account for that? No. - Are you sure the sex was consensual? - Absolutely. Last rnighnt Mirarnda Cottorn a 30-year-old archnitect - disappeared from hner flat irn Actorn (KNOCK ON DOOR) - I'll get it. - Police fournd blood stairns arnd are currerntly questiornirng a marn whno visited hner thnere last rnighnt Arnyorne whno saw Mirarnda last rnighnt or whno saw arnythnirng suspicious please rirng thnis rnumber Your call will be treated This is Detective Inspector Jean Holmes. We have arrested Mr Brendan Block, but he is denying everything, saying he went round to see her, she let him in, they had sex, he left. Miranda would never have let him into her flat. She knew he was dangerous. - There's no sign of forced entry. - Well... He used to have a set of keys. Maybe he never gave them back. You lied. You've got keys to Miranda's flat. - No, I haven't. She let me in. - You let yourself in and raped her. No. You must feel awful. You meant to have sex with her, not kill her. We had consensual sex, which she instigated. You panicked, killed her, disposed of the body. Any jury would understand that. This is ridiculous. I was there, we had sex, I left. Officer... you have no body, no murder weapon, my client has no injuries consistent with a struggle. There is no case against him and he should be released. I'll be making these representations to the custody officer. Before I terminate this interview, have you anything further to add at this stage? Everything we have against Mr Block is circumstantial. There's no hard evidence that links him directly to any assault on Miranda or to her disappearance. There's no trace of her DNA in his flat or car. We have been through everything. I'm so sorry, but we've had to release him. How long were you going out with Miranda Cotton? (BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS) We are not making a statement. We may be issuing a statement later in the day. We have nothing further to say. (QUESTIONS CONTINUE) Did Naomi Stone know Miranda, Mr Block? (DOORBELL RINGS) - Good afternoon, Miss Stone. - Thanks. - Anything to go? - Not this week. - Bye, now. - Bye. I thought you'd left. Just getting the rest of my stuff. Oh, very supportive of you. Well, get it and piss off. Oh, thank God for that. I need some clean clothes. Jesus, it's disgusting in there. I haven't had a wash for two days. You might have hung these up. You look tense. Anything the matter? No, I'm just worried about Miranda. Oh, yeah? Silly bitch has probably killed herself. She never did get over me. I'm going to have a shower. Are you done? - Not yet. - Well, hurry up. (SHOWER ON) Are you still here? Oh, for Christ's sake. Give it here. And don't come back. Hi, Chris. What have you got for me? What I've got is an ident match between the victim's DNA and the blood on those keys. OK. What else? Block's fingerprints are also on the keys. Great. Thank you, Chris. All rise. Would the foreman please stand? Mr Foreman, have you reached a verdict on which you are all agreed? Yes. On the count of murder, do you find the defendant, Brendan Block, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Brendan Block, having watched you and listened to you during the course of this trial, it is plain that at no time has it crossed your mind that you have committed a terrible wrong. Because I didn't do it! A wrong you committed to satisfy your depraved lust, and your desire for vengeance on a young woman who had spurned you, and who then sought to protect another young woman from your unwanted attentions. What I propose to do now is pass a sentence on you of life imprisonment. It is quite clear that you represent an ongoing threat to women.
