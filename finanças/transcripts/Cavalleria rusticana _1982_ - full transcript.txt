O Lola, in your milky-white nightgown... ...white and red as a cherry When you lean out there's a smile on your lips Happy the man who first kissed you Blood is spilled at your door But I don't care if that's where I'm killed If I die and go to heaven... ...and find you' re not there, l' ll turn away The scent of oranges comes from the green slopes The larks are singing among the myrtle flowers It's the time when everything is murmuring the song... ...that makes hearts beat faster Out in the fields, amid the golden grain... ...we hear the sound of your looms Tired by work, we rest And think of you and your lovely eyes We run to you... ...like the homecoming bird It's time to stop work in the fields Our Lady delights in the risen saviour It's the time when everything is murmuring the song... ...that makes hearts beat faster - Tell me, mamma Lucia - It's you. What do you want? Where is Turiddu? Why have you come here to look for my son? Forgive me, I just want to know where to find him I don't know. I don't want a row Mamma Lucia, l' m begging you in tears Treat me like Jesus did Mary Magdalene Tell me, where is Turiddu? He went to Francofonte to collect the wine No He was seen in the village last night What are you saying? Why hasn't he come home then? Come inside I can't enter your house l' m forbidden communion What do you know about my son? There's a thorn in my heart The horse stamps, the bells jingle Crack the whip! Let the icy wind blow, the rain and snow fall What do I care? The horse stamps, the bells jingle Crack the whip! What a fine trade to be a carter Travelling all over Lola's waiting for me at home. She loves me and comforts me She's fidelity itself The horse stamps, the bells jingle It's Easter and here I am You' re lucky, Alfio, always to be so cheerful Mamma Lucia... ...do you have any of that old wine left? I don't know Turiddu's gone to get some He's still here I saw him this morning near my house - What? - Say nothing l' m going The rest of you go to church - Regina coeli, laetare - Alleluia Quia, quem meruisti portare Resurrexit, sicut dixit Sing hymns to the living Lord He has risen in glory from the grave Sing hymns to the risen Lord Today he has ascended into the glory of heaven Sing hymns to the living Lord Sing hymns to the risen Lord Today he has ascended into the glory of heaven Why did you tell me to say nothing? Mother, you know that before he went off to the army... ...Turiddu promised to be faithful to Lola for ever When he came back, she was married He tried to kill his passion for her with another love He loved me I loved him I loved him She was jealous of my happiness She forgot her husband Burning with jealousy... ...she stole him away from me I've lost my honour Lola and Turiddu are lovers And I weep What are you telling me on this holy day? I am damned Go and pray to God Say a prayer for me Turiddu will be coming I want to beg him one more time Help her... ...mother of God What are you doing here, Santuzza? I was waiting for you It's Easter. Aren't you going to church? No - I have to speak to you - I was looking for my mother I have to speak to you Not here Where have you been? What do you mean? Francofonte - That's a lie - Believe me, Santuzza No, I just saw you turn down the path And at daybreak... ...you were seen near Lola's door Were you spying on me? No, I promise Her husband Alfio was just telling us Is this how you repay my love? - Are you trying to kill me? - Don't say that Then leave me alone Your pity has no hope of placating my anger Are you in love with her, then? - No - She's much prettier Shut up, I don't You love her, curse you That wicked woman has taken you away from me Careful, Santuzza, l' m not a slave to your jealousy Beat me, insult me, I still love you and forgive you But the pain I feel is too much O iris flower... ...heaven has angels in their thousands But only one man is as handsome as he O iris flower... Turiddu, has Alfio come by? I've just come out, I don't know Perhaps he's still at the blacksmith's He won't be long Are you hearing mass outside? Santuzza was telling me... ...that today is Easter Sunday And the Lord sees everything Aren't you coming to mass? No, only those free from sin can go I thank the Lord and kiss the ground You' re right to do so, Lola Let's go. There's nothing to keep us here Do stay Yes, stay. I have something else to tell you And may the Lord aid you l' m going Do you know what you've said? I meant it, and you deserve it For God's sake! Tear out my heart - Turiddu, listen - Go away Turiddu, listen No, Turiddu, stay. Are you really going to abandon me? Why do you follow me? Why do you spy on me, even up to the church door? Your Santuzza is begging you in tears How can you throw her aside? Stop bothering me, it's too late to be sorry - Watch out - Your anger doesn't worry me The curse of Easter on you You liar! The Lord has sent you, Alfio How far are they with mass? It's late now But Lola went in for you with Turiddu What did you say? That while you are out... ...in wind and rain... ...earning your bread... ...Lola is making you a cuckold In God's name... ...what are you saying? The truth Turiddu has dishonoured me And your wife... ...stole him away from me If you' re lying l' ll tear out your heart My lips never lie To my shame and sorrow, it's the sad truth I told you Turiddu dishonoured me... ...and your wife stole him away from me Then l' m thankful to you, Santa It was shameful of me to tell you They are the shameful ones and I won't forgive them l' ll be avenged before the sun sets I want blood. l' m filled with anger All my love has turned to hate Let's go home, friends, where our women are waiting for us Now our hearts are full of joy, let's not linger Let's go home, friends... ...where our husbands are waiting for us Now our hearts are full of joy, let's not linger Lola, are you going without even saying hello? l' m going home. I haven't seen Alfio Don't worry, he' ll be here Meanwhile, come here, my friends Let's drink a glass A toast to bubbling wine, sparkling in the glass It brings joy, like the smile of a lover A toast to honest wine, that brings us cheer Black moods drown in its tipsiness To your loved ones! To your good fortune! Let's drink Continue the round To everyone's health To yours, Alfio Welcome. You must have a drink with us Look, the glass is full I won't take your wine It would turn to poison inside me Suit yourself What's going to happen? Come away from here Have you anything else to say to me? Me? No At your service, then - Now? - Now You've bitten well, Turiddu It seems we understand each other Alfio I know that l' m in the wrong I'd let my throat be cut like a dog, I swear to God But if I don't survive... ...poor Santa will be abandoned She gave herself to me and she' ll be abandoned l' ll stick my knife in your heart Do just as you see fit l' ll be waiting for you behind the orchard Mother That wine is strong And today I've drunk too much of it l' m going for some fresh air But first I want you to bless me... ...like the day... ...when I set off for the army But mother, listen... ...if I don't come back... ...you must be a mother to Santuzza The girl I promised to lead to the altar You must be a mother to her... ...if I don't come back Why are you talking this way? It's nothing Just the wine Pray to God for me One kiss, mother One more kiss, goodbye Turiddu... ...what do you mean? Santuzza! Mother They've killed Turiddu! They've killed Turiddu!
