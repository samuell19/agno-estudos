- There's not a lot of energy in the room, is there? So, we're just gonna start things off with just we're just gonna sing together, "Head Shoulders Knees and Toes" just to get you all going. So here we go. You don't mind the key of F, do you? No? Okay, cool. Anyway, here we go. One, two, one, two, three, four. ♪ Head shoulders knees and toes ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, I can see about 20% of you already not committing. I've told you that we're gonna do "Head Shoulders Knees and Toes" to get the energy up in the room. And you are all looking at me as I taken a fuckin' shit on the stage. I've picked a good song. We all know the words. It's been a while since we sang it together. Let's admit it. It's been a long old pandemic. The least you do is fucking join in. I can't do this on my own. I do not have the charisma to pull off an hour's show by myself. It's also very well lit, and I don't like my gigs like that because for the purposes of the filming, they're like, well, we have to see people's reactions. So it looks like people are having fun. But I prefer to perform in absolute darkness. I don't wanna see a single one of you fucking weirdos looking at me. If I catch you not singing, you're gonna come up on stage and you're gonna do the dance in front of your stupid friends. And trust me, it's less funny than you think it'll be. I do this a lot. In fact, I do the dance every day before I go out on stage. I do it in the green room to see what it looks like, and tell you what, it's dehumanizing. I did a show in Norwich, big old venue. Big old venue. Man in the second row called by my bluff. He came up on stage. He did the dance. He did the dance in front of his family. He did it in front of his wife and his two children. That was two years ago. To this day, they've not looked him in the eye. One, two, one, two, three, four. ♪ Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes ♪ ♪ Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes ♪ ♪ And eyes and ears and mouth and nose ♪ ♪ Head shoulders knees and toes ♪ strange gig, isn't it? Strange gig. I, I'm gonna be real honest with you. That is for me. I find that funny. I find it funny that you've come to watch a nice stand up comedy, and then you're like five minutes in. You're like, I think we're, we're singing "Head Shoulders Knees and Toes" at a man wearing a keyboard. I think that's funny. I like that. Nah. Yeah. I hate that song. It's the only song about the body you've got. And it's an absolute disgrace. I'll tell you through it step by step. First section, ♪ Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes ♪ And you're thinking already, yeah, it's an absolute banger. You had four words there to outline the basic premise of a human body. You've gone for head, shoulders, knees, and toes. I can't wait to see where the song goes next. I can't wait to hear about the arms. I can't wait to hear about the torso. Second section, ♪ Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes ♪ It's very familiar, isn't it? Think to yourself, if this song is about the entire body and we're already repeating ourselves, how long is this thing gonna take? If you're gonna wait for part three, part three be good. The part three goes, ♪ And eyes and ears and mouth and nose ♪ And that is the end of the song Number one. We'd already covered the head. Hadn't we? Hadn't we? Well, we all sang together. Head, shoulders, knees and toes we weren't imagining a head without eyes, ears, mouth and nose. This isn't a song about fucking Skollip, is it? Secondly, neglected the entire area between the shoulders and the knees. Is this even a song about a human anymore at this point "Head Shoulders Knees and Toes" could also be a song about the front half of a cat. It's a disgrace. So thanks for coming. My name is Huge Davies. This is my show. It's called "The Carpark". Why is it called "The Carpark"? I hear You Scream. "The Carpark" is a musical that I wrote and performed in 2019 at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. And you know, it's a fun musical. It's lighthearted musical, it's classic me. And this musical starts with a man that I knew a very, very long time ago, ♪ Walking down this tree with my dad ♪ ♪ He holds my hand, I look up ♪ ♪ It's not my dad, it's just a random man ♪ ♪ He puts me in a van. ♪ That's part one, part two coming. ♪ The random man pulls off a mask ♪ ♪ It's actually my dad ♪ ♪ We both laugh and drive off down the road to an ♪ ♪ orphanage. ♪ ♪ He swaps me for a bike. ♪ There's 24 parts. ♪ The orphanage was just a dream ♪ ♪ I wake up in my bed ♪ ♪ but someone's painted all the windows black ♪ ♪ I'm in a sack ♪ ♪ I'm still in the stranger's van ♪ That is about as much as the musical I can perform without an actual van in the venue. See, when I performed it at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the show's not just called "The Carpark" It's a musical called "The Carpark" about a car park, like sat, sat in a car park. So the whole thing was in a car park. And then we're here. We're not in a car park. I don't know what to say. I'm, we, I can't. Do you understand what, there's no, there's no carpark. We're not at a carpark. We're in a theater, and lovely theater and it's ruined everything. Do you understand what I'm saying? What's, what's your name? - [Julian] Julian. - Julian? Julian. Let's imagine you were organizing this comedy special. Let's say you were in charge. Let's imagine that you called me up maybe about a month ago and you said Huge, we loved your show "The Carpark". "The Carpark? The musical called "The Carpark" About a car park set at the car park. And you went, that's the one. We'd love to record that for an hour's comedy special for the nice television. We'd love you to do that? Oh, brilliant. I'll see you there. I'll see you in a month. When I turned up here at two o'clock today for my tech rehearsal. Where do you imagine that I'd be imagining I'd be performing? What kind of performance space do you reckon id be in. - Sainsbury's car park. - Sainsbury's, you're right. There's a car park out there isn't there Julian? - There's big old car park out there outside the venue. You know what, Julian, maybe if you were organizing this comedy special, there'd be more people on the fucking balcony. I can see 15 seats unoccupied in the back. We were gonna film up there. No one's fucking turned up. You know what? It's probably 15 people in London somewhere, Fucking, in a car park waiting for a musical to begin. This is a disgrace. This is the worst gig I've ever done in my whole, 24 part musical, gone. I'll read you out the other section so you know what you could have been watching. So here we go. Part four, escape the van. Part five, hide in the park. Part six, seek help from a stranger. Could this be my dad? Part seven, it's not my dad. I'm now in another van. Part eight, escape the van. Part nine, seek refuge in a car park. Part 10, get help from a traffic warden. Part 11 and 12, It's the original stranger. I'm back in the first van. part 13, accept the van, the van's your life now. I exit the stage. Part 14, interval, I reenter the car park in an ice cream van. I hand out Soleros. We bond as an audience, we bond as friends. Part 15, the interval is over. I'm being sold at a car boot sale. It reminds everyone of a slave auction and destroys all of the goodwill I just created in the interval. Part 16, someone recognizes me at The car boot sale. Part 17 is my dad. What a plot twist. Part 18, the stranger sells me and the van to my dad. Part 19, my dad runs a stranger over with a van. That's classic dad. Part 20. we perform a 20 minute percussion instrumental in which we're banging different parts of the van, like in hit musical "Stomp". My favorite section of the show, sad to lose that. part 21, we inspect the body of the stranger. Part 22, the wearing of a mask. Part 23, take the mask off. Part 24, its my mum, curtains, end of the show. Yeah, yeah. So instead of trying to write a new musical in the time given, instead, I'm gonna tell you my backstory, which is set in Taiwan, which is where I'm originally from. And it's quite a harrowing story full of loss and betrayal. And it's not very funny, but it does, it does last an hour. And I find that very difficult. Not cause I just find it very difficult to sort of talk about where I'm from and that kind of stuff. But also because as someone who primarily writes musicals, I had to completely reinvent myself as a storyteller. But musicians reinvent themselves all the time. For example, do you know the band Daft Punk? Yeah, yeah. Well, don't speak for everyone. You know, if you're not familiar with Daft Punk, essentially they're two DJs who wear space helmets to make them seem more futuristic, which I think it's great. I'm quite like that as a comedian. You know, people say that about me. I'm quite futuristic in the sense that, you know, I'm not funny now, but I could be funny, you know, in a bit. Get a lot of people telling me that I'm futuristic. I get a lot of fan mail telling me that I'm futuristic. I had an email just the other day. It said, we just wanna let you know, the one you stormed off saying the crowd was terrible. The next comedian came on and we couldn't stop laughing. And I'd be like, welcome to the future. That's a classic huge Davies payoff. That is classic. It's classic, you know? Futuristic music was cool, man. Until one band came along, started doing their own dystopian song about the future. And that song ruined futuristic music forever. And that song went a little bit like this ♪ I said I've been to the year 3000 ♪ ♪ Not much has changed, ♪ ♪ but they live underwater yeah c'mon ♪ ♪ And your great, great, great, grand daughter ♪ ♪ Is pretty fine ♪ ♪ Is pretty fine ♪ Now, that to me is the most depressing song I've heard of my whole life. To recap, that's the song about someone from the year 2002 goes to the year 3000 to have sex with your great, great, great, great granddaughter, yeah. Number one, you got year 3000 and everything's underwater. Maybe the rest song should be about climate change. That's like our equivalent of Neil Armstrong going to the moon. We go, Neil, what was the moon like? What did you see up there? There must be so much stuff. And he went, the moon? Oh, well I'll tell you about the moon. ♪ I went to the moon, ♪ ♪ I went to the moon, yeah ♪ ♪ and there was no gravity, ♪ ♪ but I saw Zoom Rocks that look just like some titties ♪ No. That's my great, great, great granddaughter. You're talking bout there mate. You're gonna sleep with my relatives. You've gotta keep these things to yourself. I thought this was a fun song about time travel, not Russell Brand, the musical. And for those of you who've not done the maths for it to even be possible in the year 2002, to even have a great, great, great granddaughter in the year 3000, you're gonna have to spread 1000 years over five generations. That means if she was alive, and hope to God she was, mate, if you spread out the years, average them out, she's gonna be minimum. that's two centuries old. At this point she's the oldest woman in the world. Lemme paint you a picture. She's in Hospice. She's surrounded by her friends, her family. She's living off her drip boys. Her bones are literally dust at this point. Give us some god damn dignity in death. 2002 was [Inaudible]. What's it like in the year 3000? And the best answer you could have got was, well, everybody may have drowned, but we still managed to gangbang a 200 year old record breaker. Not my future, I'll tell you that for free. Yeah. That song was detrimental to Daft Punk. Detrimental, futuristic music wasn't cool anymore. And not a lot of people know this, but that song actually caused a rift within Daft Punk. And in 2002, the band split up, right? One of them remained as Daft Punk doing music about the future, wearing a space helmet. The other started wearing a hood. Do music from the 16th century performing as Daft Monk. Do you like Gregorian Chanting? Yeah, you do. Well, you love Daft Monk then it's like this. Do you like it? Yeah. I think you might be the only one. Not a floor filler, I'll say that much. But top five favorite songs to put over a sacrifice. Hands down. Hands down. Look, Gregorian chanting is not as popular as it used to be. You know, Daft Monk's doing a lot of smaller venues. I mean, he's doing a lot of chuder themed weddings. Ever been to a chuder themed wedding? - [Audience Member] Yes. - Yeah, you have? - Probably. - Yeah. You, you would remember. Yeah. that was a weird one, I think. Yeah. Well, as you know, it sort of starts off like this. that goes on for about an hour. It's a pretty bleak affair. It's a bleak affair. But Daft Monk he's just stalling for about 55 minutes, But I do think it's a nice surprise at the end of the gig, there's a payoff. Don't even know you're watching Daft Monk until the beat kicks in. It's like this. ♪ Praying harder. ♪ ♪ Praying Better ♪ ♪ Do it faster ♪ ♪ Makes us humble ♪ ♪ Praising him forever after ♪ ♪ Our worships never over. ♪ bit off Daft Monk there for you. Bit of Daft Monk. Daft Monk was lucky man. Managed to get out of that reinvent himself before it was too late. Other musicians are not so lucky. For example, the musician who composed this song, Does anyone know where that song is called? Any Takers? what do you think? What do you think it might be called? What would your first thought be? What do you reckon? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Circus monkey. - Circus Monkey. Dunno, where Get, I dunno. The Monkeys come from, I don't know. I don't like the circus you've been going to, quite honestly. Half a good guess. Yes, it's circusy. That's fair to say. I wanna let you know, and you can Google this after the show's finished, that song is called Entry of the Gladiators. That's song's called Entry the Gladiators. The composer heard that thought about it and was like, yeah, I think that'll be the gladiators coming in here they are. And his friends were like, listen mate, you best friends are your honest friends. And I gotta be honest with you right now, it's got more of a clown vibe and I know you set out to write a song about a gladiator and that's cool. But what's happened is you've written a song about the circus, and that's happened to us all. Let's be fair. Don't worry about that. You are the circus guy and we'll just move on and we'll never talk about this ever again. And you went, yeah, the circus. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, off death, Here they come, all 10 of them climbing out of the Mini Cooper, here they are. Oh man. have you seen the back catalog on that composer? Oh man, every single song is wrong. Here's his version of Schindler's List. He goes, His national anthem. This one's called National Anthem. Goes like this. ♪ She's just small town girl ♪ ♪ Living in big old palace. ♪ And of course, everyone's personal favorite. It is, of course the Teletubbies theme tune. Wow, wow. To be fair to him though. That was the season finale during Dipsy's funeral. God bless, God bless, God bless. "Entry of the gladiators" It's too fun a song, For gladiators. It's fun at any tempo, speed it up. It's someone on a chair, having a great time on cocaine. It's too much. Slow it down. It's someone on a chair having a great time at a Jewish wedding. It's like. It's too, If you don't like that You'll like nothing, mate. Honestly, honestly. Much better than the songs we have for gladiators nowadays. Ever seen a a gladiator die before? No. Well, you can see this in films like "Troy" or "300" or, you know, even uh "Gladiator". Anytime someone gets killed by sword, they'll fall their knees in slow motion. For some reason this will happen. It'll go. it's depressing. I find it very depressing. They say, your life flashes before your eyes when you die. If it heard that whilst I was being killed to death in an arena with swords, I tell you what, I'd feel very glass half empty about the whole thing. You don't hear that in casualty, do you? You don't got someone falling off of a ladder and Bristol in slow motion, like. just a builder called Ted walking through a field, touching on the weed with his fingers. Like. You gotta start off slow, but then you can get fun at the end. Take for example, this classic scene, you'd be like, my name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, leader of the Northern Armies, loyal to the true emperor Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, Husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance in this life, or the next. Are you not entertained? I don't wanna end up like that guy. So what I've managed to do, is I've managed to completely reinvent myself for this backstory. Now, if you've seen me live before, you know like to incorporate a live keyboard into my performances, I think that's a great thing to do, a very fun thing for me to do. But I think for the purposes of this backstory, I think it's inappropriate and doesn't really suit the narrative. So I'll be taking a big risk tonight, and I'm gonna take a step away from playing the keyboard and a step towards playing the harp. I'm already very good at the harp, I will say that. When I first started learning the the harp everyone's like, it's actually a very complicated instrument, very difficult technique. I found it very similar to playing the keyboard. I have to say, very similar. Best thing about playing the harp is, of course, there's only ever one song you wanna play on the harp. Do you know it's quite famous song, on the harp it's called "Looking Back into the Past". Do you know the song? You don't? You don't? You know it. Wait, does everyone looking back into the, You don't? Alright. I think it's one of those ones where you hear it and you'll remember it. So this is "Looking Back into the Past" on the harp. Here we go. See, you're like, oh, do you remember actually, guaranteed, that's the first time you've ever remembered something whilst hearing the sound off remembering something. You're welcome. Yeah. Okay, man. Hard, hard song to play. Do you reckon? Hard song. - Yeah. - Yeah, you're right. Very hard, one are the hardest ones. Because every time you'd start trying to practice that song, you get distracted by all the memories of your youth. You're like, oh, the van. Good memory, good memory. Always a good memory when you hear that. Never a bad memory. It's like, you know, when you're talking to someone and they're like, what'd you get up to on the weekend? You're like, I went to Ikea. You can see it in their eyes, can't you? You go, oh, furniture and meatballs. What a shop. Never a bad memory. It's never your grandfather coming over to you being like, did I ever tell you about all my friends that died in the war? You're like, no. He goes, let me tell you about a time in which I killed a man with my bare hands. Here we go. What a day. What a war. Come on. You know. That is why you never get anyone who has PTSD. learn the harp to try and forget, never, never, especially with this harp. This harp's broken. You think it's bad on the way down? Try going up and getting past top C, it's like this. what a Shame Ruins every single song I try and play on the harp. Here's a bit of "The Snowman". Here you go. Yeah. No, it doesn't work. Doesn't work. I tried Titanic, possibly even, even worse, Here we go. That's the end of that. The only song that does work, of course, is Bohemian Rhapsody. So this is the only song. You know what? you know what? This could be... We can maybe all do this together. That'd be fun, wouldn't it? Let's all sing together. Okay, here we go, so. ♪ Mama ♪ I said this would have been fun if we all sang together. get a bit of energy back in the room. Listen, I was told to do this bit because I was told that there's not a lot of joy in the show, given the fact that almost every joke is about killing someone. These are the bits of the show that you're gonna really gotta hold onto it. If you're not enjoying it, and I'm looking at you, There's a joke in about 10 minutes about Wallace and Grommet that's gonna turn this room into a real dark place. I don't like saying that joke anymore. I did that two years ago. And it's age badly, but it's important to the show. And I have to say it, when that happens, you'll be looking back at this. Like this was a fucking childhood holiday in Cornwall. How many of yous have seen Queen Live before? No? Well this is as close as you're gonna fucking get. So just fucking stack in. Here we go. ♪ Mama, just killed a man ♪ ♪ Put a gun against his ♪ Look at that. Short and sweet. That's how I like it. Short and sweet. So can't do the musical anymore. I'm gonna do my backstory instead. I've reinvented myself and yeah, I think we're, yeah, we're about halfway through now, so we'll, we'll get on with the backstory. So here we go. So. halfway through, man, halfway through. All I'm saying, is it a better show we could be having Soleros right now. I was honestly, I was gonna say here's the interval. and I was gonna come back in like this. Like you'll be sitting down like that and I was kind of coming like this. Fucked it. Fucked it. I'm furious. you know what? I think I'm gonna walk home like this actually, just a really disappoint all the local children, you know, fuck the kids. Any parents in today? Any kid parenting today? Yeah, fuck your kids. Fuck your kids hard. You know what? It's weird because of all the things I've ever said. That is my catchphrase, which is a shame, isn't it? Try to put that in a mug. I think it's got quite as sinister tone that song, isn't it? I think it's weird that parents talk to yourselves. You'll be in the park having a lovely time with your family, and you'll hear this to the trees. You'll be like. be like, yeah, I'm gonna send my kids towards that. Yeah, yeah. Go buy a treat from the creepiest looking vehicle I've seen in my whole entire life. Yeah. Go buy a nice treat from a man and a bow tie who's having an actual breakdown. Yeah, good idea. Very creepy. Very creepy. if you heard this coming from your house. like like you're loft, You'd burn your entire house down, wouldn't you? For context, If you put this beneath it like this, try this incidentally, that is also the same music, an ice cream shark man hears every time he closes his eyes. It's true. It's true. Next time you see an ice cream truck man, you'll see it, watch it very closely. He'll be at the van, right? A little girl will come up to the van, she'll say, can I have a 99 flake? He'll say of course you can. That'll be four pound fifty. Welcome to the politics section. Money's getting more, isn't it? End of the politics section. She'll come up to the, come up to the van, she'll say, can I have an ice ice cream? Of course you can little girl, of course you can. He'll handle the ice cream. She'll say, thank you. Ice cream chap man. Have a lovely day. And he'll say, you are very welcome. You have a lovely day too, and careful as you go. Don't think about the murders. So look at the backstory very quickly, very, very quickly. So as I said, this is a backstory about Thailand, which is where I'm originally from. And I do, I do actually love Thailand. I love everything about Thailand's, the cuisine, especially. I actually, before I was a comedian, I used to have a day job in which I worked in Thai cuisine. It's quite a weird job. If you're not familiar with what I do. It's quite specific. What I do is I drive all up and down the country, right? And then I find like a really packed out Thai restaurant. I'll go into that restaurant, I'll find the general manager, and I'll, I just stare at him at this. I'll be like, so that everyone at that restaurant thinks I'm from a rival Thai restaurant. Not a big earner. But the only thing that calms me down the only thing quickly, just before, oh, we have to, okay, so quick before I do the backstory. There are just three quick warnings before I start. So the first warning is that there's any, any racists in, it's honestly best if you just leave at this point. The backstory is set in Asia. And that could be quite triggering If you are like a racist. And I honestly, there's no judgment here. If you are a racist in a almost, I kind of respect you in a way. It's hard. It's a hard road out there. You know what I mean? Hard time to be, you know. So if you have a problem with any, no judgment, you just, all we have to do is you just get up and go. And, you know, no judgment here. And I don't want any of you to judge because, and I say this, right? obviously not just to stop people from going to the toilet, but you know, I'm an Asian, you know, I'm gonna be doing Asian things. I'm gonna be saying Asian things. I'm gonna be doing some pretty crazy Asian accents. It's what Asians are for. I know there's some pretty rocky stories about racism. Remember the earliest time I ever got racially abused. I remember. So, okay, so I had this frame called Mark, right? And we were best friends and we were in a band together. And we were, yeah, we had a fight, right? And he raised his voice and I raised my voice and things kind of got outta hand. And basically he called me a chink, right? And I don't really like using that word, but I think it's important to use that word. And it's important to say it for you guys to hear that word. Because what happened next is something that I'll never forget, because back then, right? I was so young I didn't really realize that was a racial slur, but I had heard of the expression chink in the chain. So I thought Mark was, sorry, I thought Mark was implying that I wasn't a team player. So I said to him, I grabbed him and I said, listen Mark, I'm gonna try harder for you. I'm gonna be putting my weight a little bit more on this whole thing because I love you. I love you as a brother, and you love me as a brother. And that's what brothers are for. And I won't let this band go down the toilet like everything else in my life. I'm gonna sit with this mark and you're gonna stick with me. And that's what we're gonna do. And when I grabbed Mark, I kissed him on the cheek and I said, I whispered in his ear and said, it's just me and you brother? Then I walked out the room and he was so confused. He never spoke to me ever again. So, you know, that's sometimes how it goes. That's how it goes. Second warning about the show is there's gonna be a lot of dream sequences. Do you like a dream sequence, man? - [Audience Member] I don't know what that is. - Oh, a dream sequence. It's sort of a bit in a film where there's a dream. - [Audience Member] Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. You like that bit? - [Audience Member] Like inception? - Like inception. I guess the whole movie is a dream sequence in a way. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. This is almost nothing like inception, but I think it's very difficult to write a good dream sequence when year Dreams are as mundane as mine, I have four recurring mundane dreams every single night. The first rcaurring mundane dream I have is I want a double-decker chocolate bar. What I do is I go to the 24 hour shop now I live, I buy a double-decker chocolate bar. I go back to my flat, I eat the chocolate bar, then I wake up. So what I do is I got 24 hour shop near where I live. I'll buy a double-decker chocolate bar, go back to my flat, I eat the chocolate bar. Then I've lived my dream. The second recurring mundane dream have is I win a lifetime trip to Japan with my best friends. But it's just fine. to be fair to me, It's where I'm originally from and I find it very boring. The third recurring mundane dream I have is an approached by both Wallace and Grommet who finger then kill me Don't look at me like that. I've told you about this bit. I'm the one in the dream every single god damn day. Don't look at me like that. Looking at me. That doesn't even sound boring or mundane. That sounds terrifying and an absolute nightmare. Yeah. But what you don't know is that dream is actually being filmed and stopped motion. So the whole thing takes months. And the fourth dream is the most mundane of all. It's just this song. It just goes on and on like this. And the minutes turn into days and the days into weeks and the weeks into months and the months into years and the years then into decades. And then I see my children die, and I see my grandchildren, they die too. And then I see my great, great, great, great, great great grandchildren. They're being fucked by bastard. That's a bit of a shame, to be honest. That's a low point in the dream. And all the time it's just this song playing like this, just on and on like this, just going on forever like that. And then I realize I'm sleeping through my alarm. It's like. Yeah. Third warning about the backstory. A lot of profound messages. How's your life going mate? It's going well. - Mine? - Yeah, - it's fine. - Fine? Well then get out. Because this is gonna change your entire god damn life, I swear to God. But I think it's very important to have a profound message. It's everywhere these days. It's in our films. It's in our films, our TV shows, it's in our music, it's in our dance music. Not familiar with dance music. I'll take you through the structure of it. So beginning of every popular dance song, there's a buildup, which I talk about music, they'll talk about dancing, right? And that's fine. But they'll be like a five second pause in which a musical will stop. They'll say something incredibly profound and then the music will just continue on like nothing's ever happened. I'll show you mean. So it starts quite a gentle like this. It's sort of like this. ♪ Grass on the dance floor. ♪ ♪ I'm feeling the beat ♪ ♪ I'm feeling the music ♪ ♪ I'm feeling the heat ♪ ♪ The sound of the drums, yeah. ♪ ♪ Is feeling the floor. ♪ ♪ I see you walk through a toilet door. ♪ ♪ Cross on the room yeah ♪ ♪ Looking at me ♪ ♪ Looking at you and my heart starts to beat ♪ ♪ This room is on fire. ♪ ♪ She whispers to me, ♪ ♪ oh, how deep is your love? ♪ What the fuck is that? How deep is your love? I heard that in the middle of a popular dance song and it sent me to an existential crisis. Almost cracked the fucking car lads. Take the person you love the most. Like my mom, right? My mom loves me unconditionally But if I went to my mom's house Deep in the heart of Korea, where I'm originally from. The jungles of Seoul where I'm originally from. I went to her house and I said, mom, how deep is your love for me? She would say, we are not that close. We don't really speak that often anymore. How deep in love is such a weird thing to say, such a profound thing to say. And yet nothing to do with anything else going on in that song. But as long as it's profound, if it's a genre of popular dance music, you can put anything in there and you be like. ♪ Cross on the dance floor ♪ ♪ You lookin' at me ♪ ♪ lookin' at you ♪ ♪ And my heart starts to beat ♪ ♪ This room is on fire ♪ ♪ She whispers to me ♪ ♪ What happens after we die? ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ Come on now, let me hear you. ♪ Would you torture to save someone you love? ♪ ♪ Hit it. ♪ Come on now. Oh, they've got your mum. - I think the only thing worse than hearing dance music on the radio is of course watching dance music live at festival. Has anyone here seen a DJ perform live before? Yep. Why have you seen a DJ perform live before? A waste of time? Right? Because if you see a band at a festival, totally get it. Understand completely, right? Cause there'll be a drummer there. The drummer will be like this they're like. Yeah, it's fantastic. It's fantastic. Yeah. There'll be guitarists there. Guitarists there, they'll be doing this they'll be going. calabungah, you know. See you DJ perform live. It's like watching someone else stand next to a table for a bit. Here's my impression of a DJ performing live. Here we go, right John, right up please. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here it comes. Wait for it. Here it comes. Here we go. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Wait for it. Here it comes. Here it comes. Wait for it. Here it comes. Some of this, some of this. Bring it back up again, baby. Here it comes. Alright, here it comes. Here it comes. Wait for it. Here it comes. Are you ready? I said, are you ready? Well, I'll wait for it. Here it comes. Some of this, I don't, I dunno, I don't. All right. Here, here goes. Alright. Here we go. Shh. Here it comes. Wait for it. Here it comes. Shh. Shh. Here it comes. Wait for it, here it comes. Shh. Shut up. Wait for it. Here it comes. Here it comes. Yeah, for a fucking hour. Can't see anything. Can't see anything. Can't see the hands, can't see the table. All I can see is the head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes. My best friend Mark, he used to be DJ. He used to be, he couldn't tell what he was doing when he was doing it. Half the time he was Djing, Half the time he was just trying to find something in a bag. Just like, ♪ How deep is this bag? ♪ Come on. I think the only way to be a long term successful DJ is to wear a space helmet and then just get someone else to DJ for you. That's the only way I would do it. I doubt that DAF Punk have attended one of their gigs in the last 10 years. I'd say that, you know. For example, right? One of the members of Daft Punk left Daft Punk, moved to Malaysia where I'm originally from, started a family, moved back here, left his son in Malaysia, right? Became Daft Monk. And none of you even noticed. Yeah, I love Adele. You love Adele. We all love Adele. But let's be very clear, if Adele was too poorly to perform, you couldn't just stick someone else on stage in a space helmet. That wouldn't do. Like, if someone came on was like, hello, it's me. You'll be like, is it? I will be clear with you. And I was kind of hoping that you clap and is too late now. No, no, no, no. It's too late now. And this is your fault. But we're gonna do "Head Shoulders Knees and Toes" again to get the energy back in the room. And we're gonna be doing my version this time. It's head, shoulder, knees, and toes, but with an extra verse, right? So it's a normal "Head Shoulders Knees and Toes" And then another verse in which we do every other single part in the body as it should be. So it's head, shoulders, knee, and toes song. And then another verse with all the different body parts in it, as it should be. Please join in if you know the words. ♪ Head shoulders knees and toes ♪ ♪ knees and toes. ♪ ♪ Head Shoulders knee and toes ♪ ♪ Knees and toes ♪ ♪ And eyes and ears and mouth and nose ♪ ♪ Head shoulders knees and toes ♪ ♪ Knees and toes ♪ ♪ Groin forearm hip and skin calf and wrist ♪ ♪ Heart liver bones and brains ribs and veins ♪ ♪ And lungs and throat and kidney stones ♪ ♪ And the tiny voice that tells you not to kill. ♪ Very important, very important.

That song is just an itinerary for a murderer. Tell you what? I'll do that again, right? Without the tiny voice, that tells you not to kill. And you'll slowly start to hear the song. Turn into a song about two murderers. So here we go.

NDAs, you gotta sign NDAs. You know what? And non-disclosure agreement, you gotta sign NDAs. So basically the backstory, I pitched this at Radio 4 and they were like, so they bought the rights to the backstory. So basically you're not allowed to tell anyone what happens in it until it gets released. Which is great. Now, I'm stoked about the Radio 4 drama, but I'm more stoked to the fact that they were like, you can write your own theme music. Cause that's basically all I wanted to write my own theme music. And I was going through the keyboard trying to find, you know, like a sort of a Singaporean song. You know where I'm originally from. And I stumbled across this sort of noise. Check it out. Pump it up John Found this. What do you think? Just found that in the keyboard. Do you like it? Couple, couple of people. Some people like it. I will say I will just keep playing it until you like it. I don't. Strange, isn't it? I cannot, I've thought about this every single day for two years. What's it doing in the keyboard? What's it doing in there? To give you context, they recorded that at Yamaha in the booth. They went, oh boys, we've done the organs and we've done the accordion and the guitar and the saxophone and the synth and the percussion and the flutes. We got one slot left. What should put in? should we put in? Yeah, just in case. Just in case. We need that in the orchestra. What do you reckon that sound is? So I looked up in the instruction manual. It's got all the sounds listed on there. What do you think that's listed as? what do you think that might be? any guesses? - [Audience Member] Evil laugh. - Evil. Good guess. Good guess. More specific though. You're on the right track though. - [Audience Member] maniacal laugh. - Maniacal laugh, good, more specific. - [Audience Member] Joker. - Sorry. - [Audience Member] Joker. - Joker, no it is an evil man It is a person though. You are on the right track. Even eviler than the Joker. If it's possible. Love that film. Sorry? - [Audience Member] Boris Johnson. - Boris Johnson, political again, you should have been here earlier. during the political section, please, honestly. he's the reason that the ice creams are so expensive. That's why I heard anyone add more guesses. - [Audience Member] Pervert. - Okay. And that's the end of the show, guys. No not a pervert. Okay, you'll kick yourselves. you're not gonna get it. It's a actually an ice cream truck man. There he is, again, rising is evil hair rearing up what's even stranger, And I will say this, I've not programmed this keyboard at any way. this has come with the keyboard, right? One semitone up. Coincidence, I'll think not. Another semi tone here. That's a shotgun lads. That's a shotgun. Another one here. Heartbeat. Another one. Little footstep. And what's actually interesting about that. If you reverse that and you close your eyes, you got yourself a very tasty Radio 4 drama about an ice cream truck man serial killer. So here we go. Only one person in the entire room with the eyes closed. Unbelievable. I'll tell you what this is by a long shot. The worst crowd I've ever played to in my entire life. You don't sing when I tell you to sing. You don't close your eyes when clearly you're struggling. Close you god damn eyes. You, you are just sitting there looking at me. That's mad. Don't try and get away. You were looking at me. I'm fucking sick of this crowd. you know what John? - [John] Yeah. - I turn the lights out. I'm sick of looking at them. Turn the lights out. Don't clap. What? What, what do you mean? I can still see them. What are these lights doing? Put these candles out too. Turn 'em all out. Turn 'em upside down. Turn 'em out. I will have my joke. Yeah. Turn 'em out. Listen, you're a smart crowd. There we are. Cool. Brilliant. And so this is a Radio 4 drama about an ice cream truck man serial killer. Here we go. So it's like this. Let me just, I can't find the. John, can I get the lights just for one, just one quick second here, John? Oh, that's working again. Oh, it just needs to be louder, I think. Can you hear that guys? Yeah, yeah. Cool. Turn the lights out. All right, here we go. Ice cream truck man serial killer. Here we go. All right here. There we are. Good. Brilliant. Right, so we've done, so we're not doing the musical, we're doing, doing the backstory. Reinvented myself, done the three warnings done the NDA think we're almost ready to begin the show, I think. so lemme just hang on. Lemme just see how much time we got left. Hang on. The venue shot's in five minutes. Tell you what, I think the best thing to do at this point would just be to wait in the dark until it finishes. I think I prefer it that way, you know, but, Hmm. I guess the message of the show is don't trust anyone, especially if they're in a van. I'd say maybe I'm just saying the next time you meet someone, just be careful you don't know who they could be. Take me for example, you've been with me for an hour and you've learned absolutely nothing. All you know is that I had best friend used to be DJ and I reinvented myself. And yes, I've been stolen for about 55 minutes and yes, I do think it's a nice surprise at the end of the show, there's a payoff. You don't even know you're watching Daft Monk.
