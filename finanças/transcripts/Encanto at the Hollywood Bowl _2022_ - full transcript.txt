¡Buenas noches! And welcome to the Hollywood Bowl! My name is Lin-Manuel Miranda. Together with the Oscar-nominated composer Germaine Franco, we are responsible for the music of Encanto. So I'm incredibly proud to be a part of Walt Disney Animation's 60th feature film and thrilled to help celebrate the Walt Disney company's 100-year anniversary. All of us working on Encanto, the writers, the directors, the animators, we had one goal: To bring the journey of this amazing, multigenerational Columbian family to the screen with all its complexity and talent. We all brought our own family stories to the table during production with all our culture, and quirks, and specificities. We hope that you would see a little of your own family in the Madrigal family, that you would hear a little of your own story in these songs. I don't think anyone anticipated a global phenomenon and a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Now, tonight we have an evening of firsts. We made this film during the pandemic, so this is the first time the original cast have sung these songs together on the same stage at the same time live. Tonight, for the first time, we are joined by amazing Columbian artists, Andrés Cepeda and the immortal Carlos Vives. And selfishly, I've heard about Hollywood Bowl concerts my entire life, but I'm from Washington Heights, so I wanted to tell you, this is my first time at the Hollywood Bowl. Now, I wanted the show to be really special tonight, so we built a casita. Enjoy Encanto! Make your family proud! ♪ Casita, oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Drawers! ♪ ♪ Floors! ♪ ♪ Doors!

It's a dream. It's a dream job. Let's do one more. They are young, but they understand the beauty in the song we're singing. I love Encanto because there's a lot of family stuff that's happening. They have some issues on the way, but they solved those issues during the movie. - And it's really funny. - Yeah. - There's some really funny parts. - Yeah, it's a very funny movie. Well… - You go first. - You go first. Okay, I'll go first. I like the part about Bruno - like where was like kind of… - Bruno… Yeah, he was kind of like cast away 'cause like no one really kind of like believed him. Many of them are fluent in Spanish. Dos Oruguitas was definitely their pick. We posted a video of them singing it online and could've never imagined what would happen next. So this is gonna be a big moment for them. So, singers, I just want you to know how much I appreciate your hard work. And I have someone very special to tell you just what you're going to be doing. Hello, hello, hello. Hi, kids. It's Lin-Manuel Miranda. I-I wrote the songs for Encanto, and I just wanted to tell you guys, first of all, we saw the video of you performing the song and you're all amazing. Second of all, we're doing this big concert at the Hollywood Bowl and, uh, the great Sebastian Yatra unfortunately can't join us, uh, we got the incredible Andrés Cepeda, and I was thinking maybe you guys could sing with us live at the Hollywood Bowl. ♪ Welcome to the family Madrigal ♪ See you soon.
