Look into my eyes Can't you see? That I'm flying towards heaven? Do you want to come with me? When did I fail to keep my word? I said I'll take care of it. I have to go. There's an incoming call. Yes, I know, I'll fetch you 7 p.m. sharp. Babes, wear the red dress I gave you... The sexy one! Raffy, I don't have enough money. Don't worry. I'll pay for it. If only my daughter didn't need that dress for her debut party. Hey, it's Raffy! You all look sexy! He's so handsome! You paid for it again? Raffy, think about your salary! You'll be left with nothing. This cargo is important to them. These are their dreams. Aren't you happy that we're fulfilling their dreams? Raffy, I'll leave this up to you. Take care of it. It's my son's computer. It took me months to save for it. I'll take care of this. If you need to send other things, just call me. - Okay. Thank you! - Great! Yes! I know you're arriving tomorrow. I'll fetch you. Just a minute. Kasmot! Raffy! Raffy! How are you? I thought you've forgotten to pick me up. I got stuck in traffic. I'm sorry, Mots. How was your trip? It was so long! My butt is aching! Long? It was only eight hours! The guy beside me was snoring loudly. I wanted to stuff his mouth with cotton. You're still a whiner! But that's all right. The important thing is you're here. The Alvarez brothers are together again! Here we come! How is our aunt? Just a second. Here's something for you. - Here. - What's this? What else?! A list of things to send back home. You know our relatives... They think you have a gold mine here. Don't worry, Mots. The old lady is just being sweet. She learned to be sweet when you started sending her gifts. So now she doesn't hit me with a frying pan anymore. - Let's go. - Go? What can you say about Dubai? Isn't it beautiful? It's okay, but I'm sure Canada is more beautiful. This is nothing compared to Niagara Falls. You'll discover more beautiful things here in Dubai. Just wait. Are you still working at the cargo forwarding office? Yeah! They pay well. I'll take that. Besides, I can't leave it. Mots, I'm really proud of my work. I'm making a lot of Filipinos back home happy! Come in! This is it! You can leave your luggage anywhere you want. I thought it's forbidden to drink liquor in Dubai. It's okay as long as you have a permit. It's not as strict here compared to other Arab countries. Did I send this shirt to you? Yeah! I've had it for four years. I always wear it because it's my favorite shirt. Wait. Here. I have something for you. Bye! I have to go! I have to leave now. - Melba, this is Kasmot, I mean, Andrew. - Hi. So he's your brother! He's cute! Of course! It's in our genes. I just hope he's not as arrogant as you are. Bye! I really have to go. Kasmot, you should try these lamb chops. These are expensive in Manila. Wow! You two are so sweet! They should be! They haven't seen each other for nine years. When we were young, I always prepared his food and fed him. I've always spoiled this kid, especially after our mother died. I'm sure you will like Dubai, Andrew. It is a mixture of the traditional and the modern. Wherever you look, all you see is prosperity. Do you see that? That is the Burj Al Arab. That is the most beautiful hotel here. Its interiors are made of gold. It's beautiful! Filipinos here are well-respected... And here in Dubai, the crime rate is almost zero. The justice system is efficient. Unlike our country's. Well, I still prefer snow to sand. Right, Raffy? Andrew, taste this! You have to forgive Basil. He's always selling Dubai to the newcomers. I'm only saying the truth. Dubai is a beautiful place, right? You're only saying that because you have many lovers here. That's right! It's easy to be tempted here because you're far away from home. Relationships don't last here. Just like this person. He changes women as often as he changes his underwear. How about you, Andrew? Do you also collect girlfriends? No. The problem is I haven't found the right girl yet. I've heard that before! In fairness to Raffy, even if he's a heartbreaker... he's a nice person! - He goes along well with everybody. - Yes! He's the best! That's why it's so easy to borrow money from him! Hey! Andrew, you're really lucky to have Raffy as your brother! He's everybody's idol! A toast to Raffy! Cheers! Raffy, I'll just go with you. No. You should enjoy your free time before you start working. Don't worry! Dubai is a safe place. Even if you walk out here at dawn, no one will hurt you. What if I get lost? - Just ask a Filipino for directions. - Where? If you have any problems, just call me. Relax! If you get lost, it's an adventure! Just take a taxi if you want to return to the pad. Hey, I sent this! All of my clothes came from you. Here's 100 dirhams. - Good luck! - Hey! Cookie? The bastard stood me up again. I hate him! If he doesn't want me anymore, he should tell me the truth. I'll call you later. Miss, you left your bag. Someone might steal it. You're new here? About two days. I see. You can leave your bag anywhere here. No one will steal it. They will even look for you to return it. The only thing that gets stolen here is your heart. Whoever he is, he's stupid! Kasmot? Kasmot. - Do you think you still have money? - Please stop! Your mother's dead! No one will send you money anymore! Stop it! Don't worry, Mots. We won't have any problems once we're in Canada. That's mother's dream for us. But she's dead. How will we go to Canada? Who told you we're not going to Canada? We will go there! We will fulfill mother's dream. I promise you that. Just always remember this. No one can break us apart. We're solid forever, right? Wow! You're a big shot! I just got lucky. I don't think luck has anything to do with it. That's very important. You have to like you're doing. I hope I'll like my job... so I can be good at it and be as successful as you are. Do you come here often? Only when I feel like thinking. This is my favorite spot in Dubai. When I arrived here, this is where I first sat down. From now on, this will also be my favorite spot. Have you been around Dubai? Just a few places. All right. I'll show you around. This way. You've been here for a long time. When did you last go home? Don't you get homesick? Of course, I do. Despite the situation in our country, I still miss it. Do you still have plans of going home? Me? Go home? My mom and I will just argue. Why? That's just the way we are. Always contradicting each other. I love my mom, but I don't want to stay with her. She's too domineering! When the opportunity to work abroad came... I grabbed it! It was the only way I could have some freedom. But you know what? I really miss her! I just want to hug her. Confusing, isn't it? Don't you miss your mom? I was only six years old when she died. What about your dad? It's just me and my brother. He raised me all by himself. You must be really close. - This one! - Try it! This one is also made of gold! This one has no scent! Try it! Your turn! Try it! Your brother lives here? Yes. Faye, thank you again. For being my first friend in Dubai. No problem. Take care! Take care too! I cannot forget you Can't you see the tears in my eyes? Try as I might, it really hurts me The truth is I still love you Even with apologies, you're late. This song is pass√©. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. Stop it. Raffy! I'm sorry. You're annoying! - Come on. - I don't want to. - Come on. - Stop it. If you won't open your mouth, I'll feed you through your nose. Delicious! You really know my weakness. You and your big appetite! Heartbroken again? Ahkbar is getting married to the woman his parents chose for him. She's so hardheaded! I always tell her to go for a Filipino. Filipinos are better lovers, right? I'll go hungry with a Filipino, or with someone like you! Ouch! That hurts, Cookie! Why should I care about your feelings? I will only marry an Arab! Aside from having a huge package, they're also rich! I will bring home kilos of gold to Bulacan! My condescending relatives will worship me! Is that clear? - Sorry! Take it easy! - Shut up! Wait. - Huh? - Let's put an end to this. Today's the deadline I've given myself. Nine months. It's either you change or I change. Nothing's changed. Here you go again. Come here. Raffy... This is difficult for me. One moment, I'm happy. The next, I see you with another girl. Am I not enough for you? We're happy, right? You are free to go out with other guys. We have already talked about this. Hi! Why did you call? I just want to thank you again. It's nothing. I'll visit you at Wonderland one of these days. Just inform me so I'll know that you're coming. That call's too long already. Who are you talking to? Friend, I'm sorry. You even call him "friend." Who's that? Okay. I'll just call you again. Who was that? Andrew? He's as handsome as I am, right? He's more handsome than you. And kinder too! Impossible! Raffy... Stop it. You know, that's one mystery in Dubai that I cannot understand. Why did a smart girl like you fall for a bastard like Raffy? People don't notice it... but Raffy only wants to be loved and needed. Perhaps because he was orphaned at such a young age. Then, what he needs is a mother! Is it okay with you that he has a lot of women? When I first learned that I'm not the only one... I tried to stay away from him. But in the end, I couldn't. Maybe because I thought... I could change him. Are you capable of breaking up with him? It will hurt me. Can you stay with him? It will hurt me too. Girl, get yourself together! For me, it's simple. I will not fall for a Filipino. Why not? Not only do they need constant attention, they're playboys as well! Maybe it's because we have a matriarchal society. Mothers love pampering their sons. And when they get married, they still want to be spoiled. I'm destined to be miserable. And I might even lose my beauty. If I cannot marry an Arab, I will remain a spinster! So, you've met Faye. It's all right. She's one of the girls I go out with. She's a nice girl. Why are you like that? What do you mean? How do you do it? Having many girlfriends? I don't promise them anything. The important thing is, I don't force them. If they want to end it, we split up. But who will you marry? Kasmot, I'm too young to get married! I still want to enjoy the single life. If you're like that then you're not being honest to them. Are you an honest person? Did you come here to give me a lecture? Let's go! - Let's dance! - Yeah! - What is it? - It's Faye! Faye! I'll take that. - Thank you! - You didn't tell me you were coming. My clients cancelled their appointments today. - It's a good thing you were able to come. - Hey. I wouldn't miss this, of course. And you? How are things? When are you leaving? - That's so soon! - Don't look so sad! After a few months, you can apply for a new visa. - You'll be back here in Dubai. - That's right! That's not the reason I feel sad. I'm sad because I spent all my earnings buying gifts for my relatives in the Philippines. Did you know that Sony appliances are cheaper in the Philippines? Well, that is our fate! To serve the foreigners here, and to serve our families in the Philippines! That's right! Faye! Faye! Faye! Let's end this, Raffy. Faye... It's not your fault. I got myself into this situation. But don't stop me this time. We have to end this. Faye, I didn't promise you anything, right? I told you I'm not ready for a serious commitment. I know. That's why we have to end this. Is that what you really want? Sorry about my brother. It's my fault. No. A woman like you... should be treated well. Thank you. Faye! I'll take you home. All right. Let me drive. Sure. You know... Your brother is actually a good man. Filipinos here run to him when they have problems. Even when we were kids, he was like that. He's everyone's big brother. He gives advice and solves everyone's problems. Protector of the weak. True! And he refuses no one, especially beautiful and sexy women. You know there's a lot of us, right? We're all so stupid! Hoping for nothing! That's enough. You've drank a lot already. You know, you're kinder than your brother. The woman you court will be really lucky. Sometimes I wonder how I ended up here. What am I doing in Dubai? Am I after the money just like other Filipinos? Am I just running away from my mom? Or am I just trying to fill up my emptiness? I don't even know what I'm looking for. All I know is, there's always something missing in my life. Maybe because I grew up without a father. That's why I cling to other people even if they don't love me completely. Like Raffy. Maybe I'm just messed up. Maybe what I'm looking for is not here. Maybe the person who will love me isn't here after all. Assuming that person even exists. Faye! See? I told you to stop. Come here. You won't listen to me. I don't usually get drunk with beer. You can't control yourself. You're already drunk. Sleep it off. Don't leave me. I don't want to be alone. Just leave after I fall asleep. Faye! Your plant has wilted again. Haven't I told you that it's difficult to grow plants in Dubai? You don't listen to me! I really don't have a green thumb. That's my mother's frustration. Every time we fight, I destroy her plants. Where are you going? I have a new suitor! You know me. As long as I'm alive, I will find myself an Arab! I don't know how you understand each other. We let our hearts do the talking. That's so corny! They only like you because you look exotic. Hey, that's nasty! Here, let me return the favor. You are just one of the many women of your philandering boyfriend, and you think you are an angel of God sent here to reform him! Now you're speechless. I already broke up with him. It happened so fast. If they don't operate on my son, he'll go blind! Raffy, I haven't seen him in three years! What's going to happen to him now? He's only thirteen years old! My brother is also here. I'm sorry. I'm really short on cash right now. Raffy, thank you very much! You're so kind! Thank you so much! I'll pay you back soon! This is all I can give for now. Thank you so much! I owe you so much, Raffy. ‚Ä™Raffy! How come ‚Ä™you've only saved this much? After nine years, this is all you have? Who told you to touch my things? I thought you'd have saved more. How will we go to Canada? We'll push through with it. Why are you always talking about Canada? We're in Dubai. While we're here, we should focus on our work. How can we go to Canada, if you keep lending your money to other people? Especially your women! You don't even think about our future. Don't be pesky, Andrew! Until now you don't know how to manage your money! From now on, I will handle our savings. - Sure! Do it! - Because if I depend on you... I said, go ahead! You knew you were going to face that problem when he got here. So, what are you going to do? Are you just going to lead him on? Are you just going to pray that he would decide to stay here? And that he would forget about Canada? Fine! Tell me... How will I tell him? How will I tell him that I've given up on our dream to go to Canada? The only reason for that is because you were always sending him money, and you are helping other Filipinos here. Why don't you explain that to Andrew? He'll understand. It will only hurt him. You don't have to be a perfect person to your brother or to anyone else. Basil, have I really changed? Have I become so bad that I let go of our dream? Raffy, you are not a bad person. You are a good friend, and most of all, a good brother. You don't owe your brother anything. Besides, what's wrong if you decide to settle in Dubai? I don't know... Forget it! Is that what's really bothering you, Raffy? Or is it something else? I know you, Raffy. It's Faye, right? Why did you let her break up with you? I can't give her the commitment she wants. Why not? Your days as the playboy of the Middle East are over. Faye is a good person. Even if you don't admit it, I know you still love her. If you let her go for good, you might regret it for the rest of your life. I took up Business Management. I wanted to take another course... but my brother said I'll need it when we go to Canada. We plan to start a business there. You can do that here in Dubai. Why go to Canada? That's really our dream. Canada. Our mother used to work there. She told us that settling down in Canada is our best option. There, you can acquire citizenship. And there are equal opportunities for everybody. If you work hard enough, you can even own your own house and car. Though the taxes are high, you get good service from the government. Isn't that enticing? Your brother seems happy here already. No way! This is not our dream, Faye. Canada is our dream. It's Raffy's fault that we're still stuck here. He is always using his savings to help other people. But I will work hard and save my earnings. I'll show him! Partner, make sure you send her the best orchids, okay? The most beautiful ones! Send it to Faye Sarmiento. Faye Sarmiento. Yes. Wait, hang on... I'll get it tomorrow morning so I can give it to her myself. Thank you! The best ones, okay? Let me do that. I'm sorry about last night. It's nothing. I... What is it? I saw Faye again. Are you getting back with her? Melba? Mia's party? When is it? Melba, I won't be able to go. I can't go, that's that. So, do you still have any complaints? I don't know. It doesn't seem right. It feels so awkward. Is it his fault that he's the brother of your ex-boyfriend? The important question is, are you really over Raffy? Well, there you go! So, what's the problem? Besides, you're not the first woman in history who has fallen for two brothers. It just so happens that your taste is consistent. Faye, enjoy this! Isn't that what it's used for? Try this! It fits you perfectly! It suits you! I think I'm older than you! So what? I'm taller! Wait a minute! How dare you! My heart says... I didn't know you were so funny! My heart says... It's so easy to make you laugh. I just have to do this and you start laughing. Come on. Let's open this. Let's go. Let's get some food. Food? You don't have to do anything. I'll take care of it! Just stay there. You look happy. I'm feeling fine. Your contract with this hotel will last for four months. After that, we'll take care of your employment visa, so you can work here longer. I'm telling you, after four months, our bank account will have more than enough. What's going on with you? You look like a fool. You know what? Faye is okay! I noticed the two of you go out often. Yeah! When I'm with her, I feel so confident. But, just as you said, she has a big appetite. And she can't sleep unless the lights are on! This is it! Don't you want me to buy? Hey, you're deep in your thoughts! Is there a reason for us to celebrate? Hey! Andrew and I are just dating. Just dating? That's way too slow! Do you want me to find you an Arab? If you fall in love with Andrew, that's good! If not, there's no problem! Cookie, I've been looking for you. Your sister sent this. A letter? My sister is so dramatic. She could have just called. Why can't she be simple like me? What's wrong? It's my good-for-nothing sister! That's why she's been getting fat... She's pregnant! I worked so hard to bring her here even if she can't speak English fluently. I bought her a visa. Now, she's pregnant! I'm sure I'll hear a lot from our condescending relatives! - Raffy! - Kasmot! What are you doing here? I was in the area. I thought I might pay you a visit. - How is it? - It's okay. That looks nice! It's a gift from Faye. She got a big discount because it's on sale. Do you want to come with us? We'll go cruising. Faye has been bragging about the sand dunes. No. It's your date. Come with us. After all, we haven't gone out for a long time. Okay. We'll take my car so you won't have to rent one. Let's go! Are you okay? Here. Are you okay, Kasmot? That's a lot of camels! So many! Whoa! Wow! I've never seen so many camels. You can even pass between their legs. Take our picture! Come here, Faye! You can tighten the shot! Zoom in on us! All right. - One more! - Huh? We'll take one more. Got it! Wait! I'll take your picture. - Huh? - I'll take your picture. Wait a second... You can tighten this. See! You smell like these camels! Jerk! Strike a pose! Come on! Don't be shy! Show us your camel dance! Hurry! Hurry! When we were young, Raffy was always challenging me to beat him. He was always defending me. Now, I have beaten him. What can you say, Raffy? How's work, Kasmot? I'm doing great. It's so easy! Even though I'm new on the job, my boss already likes me. I knew you could do it. Not just do it, Raffy. I can do it well! My work isn't hard at all. - Back then... - That was a long time ago. I learned to be on my own. Back in college, I was the leader in all activities that I joined. They told me I'm a good strategist. You know what, Raffy? I think that's where I'm better than you. Strategy. Good! You're better than I am now. Work harder, Andrew. I'm sure you'll get promoted soon. Of course, especially now that I have an inspiration. So, do you like Dubai now? Well, this is only temporary. Besides that's really our plan. Right, Raffy? Oh, it's starting! Here she is! Come on, Faye! Good night! Go on, good night! Faye, I didn't know you were already here. I met a new guy. He's so handsome! What happened? I still love Raffy. Why are you meddling with us, Raffy? What did you two discuss when you dropped me off? What are you saying? Faye and I didn't discuss anything. Damn you! She broke up with me because of you. And now you're telling me you didn't talk? Tell me the truth, Raffy. Do you still love Faye? Do you still love her?! Faye and I are over. You're over? It's so easy for you to say that, right? With you, once you're tired with a person, you simply dump her. When you want her again, you just pick her up. You made fools of us! - You don't know what you're saying. - I don't know?! Why? Who started our dream? It was you, right? For nine years, you made me believe that we can fulfill our dream! Then, what? When I came here, you showed me nothing! You didn't even save enough! You would rather lend your money to other people here. I am only repaying the help they've extended me. I wouldn't be here without them. The truth is you enjoy being treated like their hero. Raffy, you're not helping them. You're using them! But you can't fool me and Faye! We are not your toys! Faye? You know nothing about me and Faye, Andrew. You know nothing about my life here. Maybe not. But what I do know is... You betrayed me! You even betrayed Faye! If you have no respect for us, have some respect for yourself! Have some dignity! Damn you! Get off me! Get off me! Yes! You're right! I failed to fulfill my promise! I admit that I was cruel to Faye! I betrayed you! I betrayed all of you! Because I'm a bastard! A bastard! Now, are you happy? What do you want to do now? Huh? Do you want to get even for all the pain I've caused you? Go ahead! Hit me! Smash my face in! Do you think you're the only one who's been hurt by what happened? I hurt even more. You don't know what I've sacrificed to fulfill all my promises to you. Maybe I was wrong because I spoiled you too much. I loved you too much. Kasmot, believe me. I don't know how to tell you the truth without hurting you. I asked you to come here because I miss you. I was hoping you would like it here because this is where I am. Because we'd be together. Just the two of us. That's what matters, right? Right? Is he the father? It's Andrew. My situation's too complicated, isn't it? Not really. You're just in love with the brother of the father of your child. I'm so stupid! Ma? Faye! I haven't heard from you in a long time! Are you okay? I'm okay, Ma. Excuse me. Where's Raffy? He's in there. We'll raise that child. - I'm willing to marry you! - No, Andrew. I don't want my child to grow up without a father. I'm not getting married just because I'm pregnant. Faye, I love you. - That's not the case, Andrew. - You will not regret it. - Andrew, please. - Faye, listen to me! No, you listen to me! Give me the freedom to decide. I have a right to that child! - I have the right to decide for myself! - That's enough! Our main priority right now is for you to leave Dubai immediately. Once the authorities find out you're pregnant, you'll be sent to jail! - And you too, Andrew! - That's why I'm going to marry her! If they find out she got pregnant before your wedding... they will still imprison you. I already filed for a leave of absence. I have booked a flight to the Philippines on Monday. I'll go with you. I won't let you travel alone. I want to go home alone. Faye... My decision is final, Andrew. It has nothing to do with my feelings for you or for Raffy. All my life, I did nothing else but run away from my problems. I want to find myself, but I can't do it. I'm so tired! I want to be a whole person before I give birth to this child. I hope you will respect my decision. You will always be the father of my child. Why don't you spend the night here? You can go back to your boarding house tomorrow. I can fulfill everything I told her. Andrew, we have to respect Faye's decision. Will you stay out of it? This is about my child! This is all your fault! You're right. It's my fault. I was weak. I let go of our dream. I was afraid to start anew in Canada. I'm afraid I couldn't take it. After everything that happened to me here. But Andrew... You taught me something right. I shouldn't have let go of our dream. It's not enough, but at least it's a start. If I have to endure hardships again... I will do it. You don't have to work again, Andrew. You can just stay here. And then... Give me some more time, we will fulfill our dream. You know... You know I will give everything for you, right? I am willing to do everything for you. I can give up everything for you. Because you're my brother. You are the only family I have left. I love you so much. And if it's a crime to do so, I'm sorry. I really need the money as soon as possible. If you can't give me a loan, maybe you can refer me to a bank. This is so sudden, Raffy. What is it for? For my brother. I want to fulfill our dream. Here you go, Raffy. I'm really sorry, Raffy. This is all I can give you right now. - Thank you. - Here, Raffy. That is all I have. Thank you. Hi, Andrew! Why are you in a hurry? I still have to work. I'm already late. You're driving an unregistered car. The police might catch you. - Be careful, Andrew. - Be careful. This is only temporary. - I'm already arranging my papers. - That's good! It's hard to get a job if you're an illegal alien. - That's true! - Take care! - I have to go! Bye! - Take care, man! - Take care, Andrew! - All right. - Take care! - Okay. Thank you so much. Even if you won't accept it, I'll still pay you back. Are you sure of what you're doing? This is my only chance to do something right for my brother. From where I'm standing, you did nothing wrong. They're on their way. - Hey! - Take out the beer. What time is Rexy coming over? - He's on his way. - He already sent me a message. What's taking him so long? Hey, Andrew! Your surname is Alvarez, right? - Yes, he's an Alvarez. - Really? I met an Alvarez before. Do you have relatives here? None. I don't have relatives here. Really? I had a boyfriend once. He's an Alvarez too. I first saw him... sleeping under the Maktoum bridge. He was shivering from the cold. He hadn't eaten for three days. Guess what? He's been living like a beggar for a year. Why? Was he here illegally? He used to work as a waiter in a resort but his Filipino co-workers backstabbed him. - He was fired from his job. - That's it? It's so easy to get a new working visa. That's true! He wasn't able to save enough money to buy a new working visa. He couldn't even afford to buy a plane ticket to return to the Philippines. Why? Because he was sending most of his salary to his brother in the Philippines. - Really? - He's such a good brother. For a year, he stayed with different people. Always dependent on the help of his friends. But eventually, probably due to shame, he started sleeping under the Maktoum bridge. And after you met him, you took him in to be your boyfriend! That's an old trick already, Lenny! - You jerk! - Why? Isn't that the truth? In all honesty, I really did love him. Really? Yes! But he's such a difficult boyfriend. He talks of nothing except his brother. Aside from sending money to his brother, he was always lending his money to other Filipinos. He said it was the only way he could give back to the Filipinos who helped him. I couldn't bear it, so I broke up with him. He had many girlfriends since then. But he never took them seriously. His only concern was his dream that he and his brother will migrate to Canada someday. Has he seen his brother already? I don't know. We haven't talked for a long time. Where will you stay in Manila? With my mom. I called her two days ago to tell her I'm coming home. Everything here? Yes. Thank you, Raffy. Faye! I just want you to know that I'm sorry for all of my shortcomings. If only I was brave enough to admit what I truly felt for you, this wouldn't have happened. But I know it's too late. I already hurt you. I know I have to learn to forgive. I know I have to move on. But it's so difficult. It hurts. It hurts so much. But maybe... Maybe in time. I only have one thing to say. That was so heart-warming! Now, I will stop talking because I was not the one who got married. I am now going to pass the microphone to the newlyweds. Earlier, I was asked what I was feeling. Of course, I feel happy and sad. Happy, because I'm already married to the man that I love. And sad, because we are going to be apart from each other right away. It's his fault! His contract has already expired so he has to return to the Philippines. In a few months, I will be here again. Don't worry. See? He's coming back! You can't be sure! This is getting too dramatic. It's like watching a drama show on TV. I only have one thing to say. Let's make a toast, okay? A toast to our brave friends who pushed through with their wedding despite knowing they'll get separated right away. Cheers! All right! Take your seats! Clarice! Clarice... Pol and I had a talk the other night. He said he feels sad about going back to the Philippines not because he's going to leave you here. He feels sad because he wasn't able to buy anything for his relatives, not even appliances. But I told him, no! You are wrong! You will bring home something with you, Pol. You will bring home your sense of pride for the Filipinos who are working here. You're right, Raffy! And they truly are praiseworthy! Right? It's true. We often make mistakes. We seem to forget our dreams. The promises we made. Oftentimes... we even hurt the people we love. But we, Filipinos, never forget why we are in this foreign land. We are here... because of the people we love. No matter how hard life here can be. No matter how sad. We are willing to accept it to make our families happy. For every drop of sweat, every tear we shed, all we ask is their smile. A simple smile from them. So... Even though we are so far away from our families. Even though we don't see them. Each of us has the same dream. That is to see our families whole again. And to fulfill that dream, we have to stand up after we fall. I remember a saying. The Filipino... Wherever he is, he is always the best! Truly the best! Long live the Filipino! I'm going to follow Raffy. I'll go to Canada. I already have my visa. I thought you'd go there together? Just me. He doesn't know about this. Please give this to Raffy when I leave. There's a tape inside. - I went here... - Did I keep you waiting? You were going to say something? Andrew, I thought you were leaving? It's my last day. I need the extra cash. Besides, I need the money when I go to Canada. All right! Take care! Raffy... Andrew's co-workers want you to know that they are willing to help. Raffy, Andrew left this. He told me to give it to you once he has left for Canada. All right. Raffy, I'm sorry for not saying goodbye. I know you would stop me because we had planned to go to Canada together. Don't worry. I'm going there alone. You don't have to go with me. I know you are already happy here in Dubai. You said you learned from me. I was the one who learned from you. You taught me to dream my own dreams. You have shouldered my dream for a long time. You deserve to have your own dreams, Raffy. Whatever happens to me, Raffy... Wherever I might go, Canada, Philippines, or Dubai... Don't worry... And Raffy, one more thing. I know you wouldn't be able to say this to Faye because you think it might hurt me. That's why I'm going to say it myself. Raffy, I know that you love Faye. And I know that she loves you. Raffy... Raffy, I'm sorry. I want you to know... I treasure everything you did for me. "Thank you" and "I love you" are not enough to let you know how grateful I am that you are my brother. I wasn't the only one you helped. You did a lot of things for other people here. For other Filipinos who are just like us. Reaching for the dream of a brighter future for their loved ones. You are not just my brother. You are everyone's brother! That's why I'm so proud of you! I love you so much! I know that even though we'll be far away from each other, we are solid forever! I know that! Kasmot... Kasmot... Your brother's here for you. I'm here for you. I love you so much! Faye! Faye, my child! - You're still so beautiful! - I missed you! Wait! Can we stop here for a while? Raffy! There it is! Are you excited about tomorrow? Yes! But I still feel nervous. You can do it! You got this! Thank you, Raffy. How about you? Are you sure about your decision? Kasmot... I'm already happy here in Dubai. But you... in case you change your mind, I want you to know that you have someone to return to. No matter what happens, we're solid, right? What do you think? It's up to you! Catch me! - Hey! - Yes! - Don't cheat! - You lost! You cheated! You lost! Hey! I'm getting old!
