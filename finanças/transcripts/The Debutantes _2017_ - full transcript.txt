[indistinct chattering] But it's like a shampoo commercial! Including shoes. -[girl 2] I'm like this when I study. -[laughter] [girls continue chatting indistinctly] [laughter] [girl 2] You're so mean! -[girl 1] "You're so mean!" -[giggling] Wait, one more time.

[rustling paper] [teacher] Lara Santa Maria, uh, see me after class. Excuse me! Excuse me. Ah, excuse me. Um… Kate, right? Hello! Lara. We're neighbors. Oh, yes, I know! But we're not on speaking terms, right? Uh, Kate… Can I ask a favor? Uh… What kind of favor? I need help with Math, I'm not really into numbers, you know. Is that okay with you? Okay, I will help you. Really? That's okay with you? Yes, no problem. Thank you, Kate. Can I get your number? -Okay. -Here. So that I can text you. -"Kate." -There. I'll save it. So, you'll text me? -Yes, of cou-- -Lara! [Lara] Yes? [chuckles] Wait. Okay, I'll just text you. Thank you very much, Kate. -Take care! Bye! -All right. -[Lara] What is it? -Bye-bye… Why are you asking help from her? I just had to. Where did you guys go? Come, Kate. Come inside. Oh, it's messy here. Can we just study on the bed? Come, come in! Hey! Kate, Thank you in advance. [Kate] It's nothing, Lara. [Lara] Please, come in! [clattering] -[clanking] -Oh, it dropped. Sit. That's my mom. She'll be coming home this Christmas. That's why by then, my grades should have improved. Where is she? The UK. She's a nurse there. So… where are we going to start? Um… Is it okay if we start from the top? Because I really need help in… Geometry, Calculus… I think everything. [chuckles] Wait. You know what, Kate, they say that Scorpios are focused. For me I'm not really sure. Whatever focus I do with Math, it's not working. I'm also a Scorpio. Oh, really? Mine's November 20th and you? October 25th. You have the same birthday as Jenny! Wait a second. So… should we start? Okay, wait. There. Okay, so, where shall we start? It's okay-- ["F.F.F." by Teenage Gritty playing on headphones] ♪ All your favorite birds ♪ ♪ Are flying chirping ♪ Wena, give it back. Wena.

Of course, you are invited to her debut. Really? Of course! So the question now is, what are you going to wear? I don't know, how formal is Jenny's party? [clicks tongue] Hmm… Just kidding.

You know, in case she doesn't have any. That's why… here. We provided for it. Are you sure? It's okay with you? Yes, it's okay. Thank you! I'm sure this will look good on her. [Lara gasps] Kate!

Kate. Sorry about what happened at the party. I didn't know they're going to do that to you. I even forced you to go. It's not your fault, Lara. Come in. Here, I already prepared some equations. Answer those, then I'll check later. Lara. Oh… Sorry, Kate, sorry. [sighs] I can't focus. Are you thinking about Jenny? [sighs] Candice and Shayne believe that Jenny committed suicide. But if you ask me, I'm not sure. Why? [sighs] I don't know. It seems… It feels weird. [club dance music playing] [tense music playing] Kate, what's this? I also don't know, Lara. [Shane] Candice! Stop! Candice! Admit it, guys! Who posted it? On my birthday? Really? Candice, calm down. Candice, wait. We are your friends, we wouldn't do that to you. You! You did it! You hacked Jenny's account and uploaded the video, right? Candice, I didn't do it. It wasn't me. Candice, Kate has nothing to do with this. I know there's a simple explanation. Simple explanation? Here's a simple explanation! She's obsessed with us. She'll do everything to ruin our friendship. So that you'll be her friend! That's not true. Candice, you may not believe me, but… your life is in danger. [Candice scoffs] Oh, my God! Stop! I saw Jenny's ghost. Seriously? And she told me that you are next. Candice, please believe me. You're such a weirdo! My God! Please believe me, Candice. You know, just admit it! You posted the video, right? Candice, please! Kate has nothing to do with this! It's not her fault! Do you want proof? -Candice! Candice, give it back to me! -Kate! Kate, let her be. Here you go! [club dance music playing] [Candice] See? She's the one who posted the video, right? Do you think you can ruin us? Remember what happened in Jenny's debut? That's nothing compared to what we'll do to you. [dramatic music] Kate! Kate! [Kate crying] Kate. Lara, I didn't post Candice's video. I know. I don't have any bad intentions. But if you don't want to believe me, I can't force you. Kate, I believe you. Sorry. It's okay. I will delete it all. I'll just delete it. Kate, those are just videos. [retching] [coughing] [ghostly whispering] Kate… [coughs] [club dance music] [Shayne] Candice, I have nothing to do with the video, okay? I know, it's that Kate weirdo! It's all her fault! You know. She's really weird. I don't know why Lara wants to be friends with her. [Shayne] Oh, here we go again. I don't know why she even involved us. [Shayne stops talking] Hello? Shayne? Shayne? Hello! [club music continues] [eerie music playing] [breathing heavily] [man] I'm sorry. Are you Candice? [club dance music continues] Are you okay? [panting] [dial tone ringing] Shayne, answer the phone!

It's all your fault. It's all your fault. Kate! [whimpering] Wena! Wena! Calm down, calm down. What happened? -What? -[panting] What happened, Kate? Shh… [sobbing] [school bell rings] People say that Candice committed suicide. But I don't believe them. Me neither. [sighs] Lara, don't blame yourself. Kate, Jenny died on her debut. After that, it's Candice. And she died! Is Shayne next in line? Lara, I dreamed about Shayne. I worry that something might happen to her. Kate, Shayne's birthday is in two days. [Shayne] Hi, Lara, hi, Kate. Are you talking about me? Shayne. We have something to tell you. Uh… Kate dreamed something bad might happen to you. Ohh! I'm so scared. Shayne! come on! Nothing wrong with taking care of yourself-- [Shayne] Come on, Lara! Can't you see? Kate is just deceiving you. Shayne. Shayne, I'm telling the truth. I saw Jenny and Candice's ghosts and you're with them. Oh, please. This is your fault. If you didn't expose her "Klepto Girl" video, Candice could still be alive. Shayne, I have nothing to do with it. Why should I do that? -Because you are insane! -Shayne! Enough! Well, that's the truth! She is insane! So please… stay away from us. [Lara] Kate. Shayne! Shayne! Shayne. Shayne, I worry about you. Shayne, please. Hey, please believe me. I did nothing for Candice and Jenny. Please, let me help you. Uh… I… I know a spirit medium. [giggles] Shayne, it's your birthday tomorrow. What if Kate's dream is true? What if… What if there's a curse and you are next? You know what? You're just like your best friend, you're both insane! Why don't you just stay away from that Kate? For all we know, she's doing this to get even with us. She's not like that. Kate is good. How can you be so sure, Lara? I believe her, Shayne. Shayne. Candice and Jenny are both gone. I don't want to lose you in my life. [ghostly whispering] Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… -Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… -[heart beating] -Kate… Kate… Kate… Kate… -[heart beating] [heartbeat grows louder] [Lara] Kate. What are we going to do with Shayne? [sighs] I don't know. I don't know. [heavy breathing] Shayne's right. I think I'm going insane. Kate, come on. Shayne didn't mean that. She didn't intend to say that. What if she is right? What do you mean? My mom also hears voices. One time, I saw her looking blankly at something. Talking to someone. Or talking to herself. Sorry, Kate. [sighs] She's being abused by Uncle Jaime. He's my stepfather. She can't handle it anymore. Where are they now? They're dead. [exhaling] Did he also abuse you? [unsettling music playing] [sighs deeply] I think I'm going insane just like my mom. I'm going insane. Come on, Kate. I don't know what happened but it's not your fault. Okay? [coughing] [retching, coughing] [phone ringing] -Hello? -[Albert] Hello. -Albert! -What's up? Let's go! I'm running late! Stop bothering me! The pool is already closing. [sighs] [eerie music playing] [Albert] Just skip your practice. Anyway, it's your birthday. [sighs] You know I can't, I have to improve my timing for the tournament. I'll go now. All right, just call me when you're done. Then I will pick you up. All right? Bye. Okay, bye. [eerie music continues] [panting] [sinister music sting] Hello? Who is it? Sir?

[gasps] Kate? Lara, I saw Shayne. I saw Shayne. Get in. Hurry. Lara, your birthday's tomorrow. Kate, I am afraid. I'm alone here in the house. I'll keep you company, I can do that. Are you sure? Is that fine with your Aunt? Yes, that's fine. [sighs] Kate, I'm afraid to die. That won't happen, Lara. But, Kate, I'm just wondering. Your birthday and Jenny's are the same but… why is it that nothing happened to you? [unsettling music playing] Lara is my friend. She's the same as her friends. Wena, she's different. She tricked you, she embarrassed you on your birthday! She had nothing to do with it, Wena. Kate. Listen to me. I am your friend, not Lara. [brooding music playing] Even before, I promised to take care of you. [sobbing] [breathing heavily] Why are you crying? [crying softly] [sedate, somber music plays] Come! [brooding music creeping in] Come in. [unsettling music playing] Come in. Where do you live? There. Where is it? There, in the place where we meet. In the tree? Where's your mom and dad? They're both gone. We are both pitiful. If you want you can stay here. Really? I can come with you? But… Uncle Jaime might hurt you. I'm not afraid of him. Don't worry. He will not hurt you anymore. I will take care of you. But it's our little secret. Is that fine with you? Okay. [Uncle Jaime] Kate! Where the hell are you? Show yourself! Kate! [sobs] When I find you, you'll see! Kate! -[Mom] Kate! Kate! -[sobbing] [Uncle Jaime] Kate! Show yourself! Wherever you are hiding, I can find you! [loud music sting] [door opens] [brooding music] [quivering] [chilling music] [gasping] -[Kate] Uncle! No! -Come here! Come here! Get down there. [crying] [wailing] Come here. I said come here. Uncle! Please, no! Please, stop it! -Who are you talking to? -[sobbing] Who is it? Who is it? Tell me! -[yells] -Aren't you going to tell me? -What? Come here. Look at me! -[screams] Is this what you want? -Please, no! -Who are you with? Is this what you want? Like this! like this! [grunts] [brooding music plays] [heart beating] [groans] [Uncle Jaime grunts] Kate! [heartbeat continues] [groans] [slams] [quivering] Did you kill them all? I just did what I promised. Why did you kill them? Kate, they're hurting you. But… But you don't need to kill them, Wena! Kate. You wanted this. No. Even if you don't say it, I know you want it. [choking] I just did what you wanted to do. No… [sobs] [Kate crying] -[Lara] Kate? -[sobbing] What are you doing? [gasping] Are you okay? Why? Kate! -Kate, why? -[groans] [Lara] Why? [gasping] Kate? -[Kate coughing] -Kate, why? Hey! Why? [gasping, retching] Kate! Kate? I am who you are. You are who I am. [gasping] [retching] I am who you are. You are who I am.
