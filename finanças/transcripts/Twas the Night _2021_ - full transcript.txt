Dear Santa Killer, I don't know why you're such a mean person but you should be nicer. I know Santa is gonna bring you coal for Christmas but please don't kill him because I won't get my bike if you do. I was gonna ask him for a cell phone but I decided to ask him to bring you friends instead because then maybe you wouldn't be so mean. Merry Christmas. Can you believe this? It's just a kid. It's not just a kid babe. Yesterday it was the mail man and the old lady across the street. I didn't even go outside. It'll pass, okay? People have a lot more things to worry about today. They don't know what they're talking about. They think that I hate Christmas and I don't, they think I hate that guy and I don't. He's just a random street guy. They just believe something, they believe whatever they hear. They're ignorant. I get it, I get it. But look, it'll pass, okay? I promise. Besides we have a lot more to worry about. Did you get the Advent wreath? You mean the candle thingy? Yes. But please don't call it that in front of my parents. I think it's upstairs. Do you think they'll like me? Of course they will. They didn't see the video, did they? I don't need them bringing that up at dinner. My mom cannot know about that. I didn't show it to them or anyone else for that matter. Listen, everything's gonna be okay. They're gonna get here, we'll have fun, it will be a fun time, okay? I hope so. They're just our parents Holly. They don't control our lives anymore. By the way, what is this? Why do you have this? It's a decoration. Babe, I've bought all of these decorations. Remember I told you. No, this is not decoration. This is a toy that's meant to make sure kids behave. But my parents used to put this thing out all the time. Babe, it's just a toy elf, okay? Why don't you leave the decorating to me, okay? You sure you don't need any help? No, I don't. Go get the food. It should be almost ready. Also, I need to take this down. Is that okay? Why? Babe, the decorations? I told you my mom is, it needs to be perfect. Okay, fine. Can you at least call the plumber and make sure they come fix the bathroom? Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay. All right. I'm off. I love you. Love you. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Thank you, sir. Merry Christmas. Hey Chris, Merry Christmas. Hey, Merry Christmas. Harmon my man, happy Hanukkah! That's what I'm talking about. Good morning Nick. Good morning Joy. Is the cake ready? Yeah, lemme check. Hey mom. Yes, everyone is coming at six. What? No, no, no, no, don't bring the cat. Why would you bring the cat? Mom, I'm sure the cat doesn't know it's Christmas. Alright, one vanilla cake with a strawberry center. It's gluten-free, right? I think so. It's fine. I don't mind sleeping on the couch. You can sleep in our bed. She can sleep on the day bed. Yeah, it's gluten-free. Yes. Yes, you can use our bathroom. It'll be $37.95. Yep. I saw your girlfriend on TV by the way. Mom, I need to let you go. Yeah, I'm paying for something. Yes, I know. I'll see you soon, I love you. Bye. You saw Holly on TV? Yeah, she was on the news. Yes. Well, I got to go. Merry Christmas. Got to do some last minute shopping and happy new year and tell your dad that I said hello. You forgot your card. Well, um... She's just yelling at the guy. What a bitch. You're listening to K 107.4, holiday classics all December long. Why don't you watch where you're swinging that damn bell? God know you do it every morning while some of us are trying to sleep. Oh, don't you have to be more productive to be doing? Get away from me. Do it again and I'll kill you. Congratulations, you just ruined my day. Oh yeah. No, this is the third time we've had to call you about this problem. You said it was fixed. I know it's Christmas Eve. I have family coming over for dinner tonight and they're staying the night and this is the only bathroom on this floor and now the second level bathroom is leaking. Not you too. I'm not actually going to kill anybody. It's a figure of speech genius. You know what? Merry goddamn Christmas. Why don't you watch where you're swinging that damn bell. God knows you do it every morning while some of us are trying to sleep. Oh, don't you have something more productive to be doing? Get away from me. Do it again and I'll kill you. Congratulations, you just ruined my day. What? Is that how you greet your mother on Christmas Eve? Because I can hang up and we can try it again. I'm sorry mom. I thought you were someone else. What's going on? Just waiting for our bags. I wanted to know if you received something in the mail. Yeah mom, I got a lot of mail. Something from me sweetheart. Context clues, context clues. Yeah, I got the... The image. Oh, don't you love it? It's supposed to be a city. I just started taking online classes in graphic design. Oh, it's that one? It's a late engagement gift. Yeah, mom. It's great. I put it up in my office already. One of my clients said that he loved it. A man of taste. Lemme let you go honey. Your father pulled his back out again and I need to help him with the bag. We'll be there soon. Love you. Bye. Bye. What a thief! Hi. Hi. what's your name? What? What's your name? I'm Holly. Jesús. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Well, Jesús, I know you've been out here all day and I was just.... Would you like some hot chocolate or some water? I have cookies too. Excuse me? Did you make these? Yeah, I did. They're really good. Thank you. And did you do all of this too? Yeah. I have family coming over later so I just, I wanted it to look nice. Oh, that's exciting. Yeah. When are they coming? Soon. Actually, six. Are you married? No, but I just got engaged last week. Oh, congratulations. Thank you. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for snapping at you the other day. It was rude and you didn't deserve it. I was having a bad day and... I'm sorry. And I also didn't mean what I said when I said I was gonna kill you. Of course not. That's just a figure of speech. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I accept your apology and I also appreciate it. We all have bad days. Thank you. But why did you... I'm sorry? Why did you have a bad day? It was just something at work. Well, I had a client that was venting about her marriage. Something about how her husband was doing really great on job and he got promoted the same week she got laid off. And she was just so angry. I don't know, and other stuff about how they were able to put a down payment on a new house and how they were now able to try and conceive a baby. And she was shaking. She was digging her nails into the sofa and her head was down and her foot was shaking. She was so angry that her life was going exactly the way that she planned but it was of no thanks to her. I don't know. It just rubbed me the wrong way. I see you got a lot of Christmas cards. - That's very nice. - Oh, those aren't really, I should just... Wait, hold on. Santa Killer? Someone really sent you this? Yeah. It's no big deal. They don't really know me. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for any of this to happen. This is terrible. No, you shouldn't apologize. It's not your fault. No, but no one should be sending stuff like this especially on Christmas. Like I said, it's really no big deal. They probably just saw me on the news. Okay, how about this? I'm gonna stop by the new station tomorrow and tell them to stop showing that video. That's not right. No, no, no, no, you don't have to do that. Tomorrow's Christmas. You should just be enjoying a happy, relaxing day with your family. Holly, you can only be as happy as the person next to you. I'll be here again tomorrow anyway. I'll drop off a letter at the station on my way over. Wait, you have to work tomorrow? Yes ma'am. There's not a day in the year when people give more. And it's not work, I'm actually an architect. I just volunteer. It's fun. The kids, they think I'm the real Santa. Okay. Thank you for everything. You're a very nice lady. You're welcome. Well, you have guests coming soon. I'll let you get back to it. I'll show you out the door. Holly, you need help with that? Oh, yeah. Actually, I can't reach it. That would be great. I can reach it, no problem. Is it crooked? No, actually that's perfect. Thank you. Oh, of course. Ho, ho! Oh my God! What happened? Who is this? Jesus, Nick! I didn't see him. Sir, are you okay? Nick, he's bleeding. It's okay, it's okay. We'll call the police and then they'll send an ambulance and he's gonna be okay. Everything is gonna be fine. You're right. Nick? Yeah. We can't call the cops. What? We can't call the cops. I think he's dead. I think he's dead. No, no, no, no, you don't know that, he could be sleeping... Nick, that was a brass bell. Look at all this blood. Then why aren't we calling the police? Because they'll think I did it. Haven't you watched the news today? I threatened him Nick. I threatened him. Nobody will think that. Nick, the letters, the text messages. I haven't even checked Facebook. What do you suggest? I don't know. I need to think. We make it look like an accident. We cover it up. You've seen Dexter! Dexter? Honey, what are you talking about? I don't know, okay? I'm scared. We just need to think. We need to think. We need to calm down, we need to take some time and think. Are we early? No. Are you sure? What could they be doing in there? They probably just want the place to look pretty. Oh, hi. You must be Nick's parents. Oh, hi. Pleasure to meet you. Did you knock? Yeah, but they're busy. Nonsense, what are they doing in there? - Hi. - Hi. Hey. Hi. Come on in. Merry Christmas! This is so nice to meet you Holly,. I've heard so much about you. Merry Christmas. This house is adorable. Look at these decorations. Where would you like me to take this bags up to? No, no, no, don't. I'll take them up myself. Don't worry about that. Don't be ridiculous, it's four bags. Dad, it's fine. I've been working out. Thanks Nick. Good to meet you buddy. Leave the little ones down there Nice to meet you too. Hi dad. Hi Holly. How are you? You seem a little nervous, what's the matter? Nervous? You're so funny. You're sure, is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Who wants wine? I'll have a glass. Okay, great. Hey honey, where can I wash my hands? You can wash them in the kitchen sink. The downstairs bathroom is broken. Holly, this house is gorgeous. Look at these floors, your kitchen, the tree. You should be very proud. Thanks mom. And y'all flew in from where? From Boston. I love Boston. That's a great city. And Holly mentioned you're from Texas? Yeah, just outside of Houston. Oh, how lovely. How was the flight? Well, your father was asleep before take-off and I just read my book. So it went by pretty quickly. Ours was only two hours. It was great. Holly, sweetie, can you please give us a tour of the house? A what? A tour. Honey, we haven't seen the place. Yeah, a tour. That'd be great. Oh well, I was thinking that we could drink the wine and I wanted to tell you how Nick proposed. Holly, that'd be great. Well, as you all know, we were on vacation in the South of France. And one night he decides he wants to go explore the roof of the hotel. He wanted to go up there even though it was shut down. So, somehow he figured out a way to get up there and it was so beautiful. You could see the city skyline, you could see the ocean. So while I'm taking all of this in, he gets down on one knee Aaw! and he proposes. Oh, it was so beautiful. We stayed up there all night long. We didn't wanna come down. Sorry guys. Did you change? What? No, why would I change? You're so romantic. Oh, thanks mom. Hey, why don't we eat? I am hungry. That actually reminds me of the church I used to go to. Just for fun Eve, humor me. Christmas at church, what do you envision? Well, not much. A priest and some prayers. Fair assumption. I still have the same name burned into my memory, Southland Christian Church run by father Patrick. Anywhere around mid-December, you would walk in and be swallowed into a theatrical Christmas display that rivaled Broadway. Trees stretched higher than columns, tinsel around every pew and stained glass shining red and green highlighting snowflakes that would dribble from the ceiling. Decorations I haven't seen the likes of until I stepped into this house. Yes, well done Holly. Oh, thank you. These decorations were so impressive that even non-religious families would come and check out the Wonderland. Every holiday was a sight to be seen. I'll never forget Easter was the best with a light show and ridiculous rock music. I'm surprised it didn't give half the audience a heart attack to be honest. But as my family went year after year, I got more curious. I had to know why one of the most visceral experiences of my younger years happened in a place that most people complain about being dragged to. So I went up to father Patrick after the show and I asked him, what's with all the theatrics? He looks at me and smiles, points across the way to my girlfriend and says, because Rudy, I have never seen that girl in this church before but she'll be in here for Christmas. Was she? Yes. We broke up in July but I saw her again in December. She brought her whole family. Well, I'd go to church if it was like that. And there's free wine. Speaking of which, I wanna propose a toast. To the newly engaged, to the soon to be extended family, to this marvelous house and the much more marvelous decorations. Oh, and to Nicholas for his big photography sale. Where did you put the photo? Actually, we do, we have... Actually, I think we took it down. Where did you put it? Why would you take it down? Babe, where did you put it? I think it's in the closet. It's behind a lot of things that we probably shouldn't touch. What do you mean? I just don't think that we should move it. Nonsense. I wanna see it. Which closet? Oh, it's right there. Mom. Mom, lemme get it. I'm sure I can handle it. Dad. What? Let her get it. Babe, I'm sure it's fine. Joe, can you help me with this? What are you guys doing with this? Holly volunteers for charity. That doesn't sound like Holly. Your bell is rusting. Did you lose a boot? Actually, You know what? I was looking for that but you can just leave that right there. Let's say a pretty big boot for your foot there Sasquatch. No one cares Joe. Is this it? This is lovely. Okay, hold on. Lemme just take this down. This has to come down. All right Joe, bring it up. Nice. Why is it so important? Because he sold it to an art gallery. Oh, very nice. If you don't mind me asking Nick, how much does a photo usually sell for? Dad. What? I'm just curious. I work in the opposite of the arts. I know nothing about this kind of stuff. But dad, you just don't ask someone how much they make. Holly, I'm not asking him how much he makes. I'm just curious how much a photo could sell for. Dad, it's still not... 22,000. $22,000 for a single photograph? That's incredible. Thank you. Where did you take it? It's actually up on the roof. It's a picture of the skyline of the town at sunrise. I would definitely cheers to that. Cheers! Rudy, honey, would you go grab a bottle? Sure. No, no, no, I got that. Don't worry about it. You know, Holly didn't always want to be a psychiatrist. She wanted to work in the arts as well. Mom... That's not true. Oh please, you were always decorating your room putting on little plays. You told us you wanted to design Broadway shows. Mom, I was like 12. That was never a real career goal for me. But it could have been. You spent so much time on it. You had those notebooks with the drawings and remember the mannequins with the fabrics. With a little bit of training and school you could have gotten better, you could've done it. Look at him. He's selling pictures for thousands a piece. Mom. I'm just saying. I can see why you two get along so well. Mom, I love my job. I made the right decision. I didn't flush away any dreams I may have had. Well... Oh, me too son. I don't know about flush away, but sure, honey. If that makes you happy. Woah! Jesus, Nick! Sorry dad. I'm so sorry. Are you trying to kill me? What? No. No, we're not trying to kill anyone. Holly, do you know where the recycling bin is? What? I was gonna take all the bottles out to the recycling bin. Do you know where it is? Yeah. It's outside on the patio. Can you come show me? Sure. Is everything okay? Yeah. I'm just going to help him. You sure? Yeah dad. I'll be right back. Come here. Come on. I'm coming! What are you doing? Did the plumber come and fix the bathroom? What? Is the downstairs bathroom fixed? No, but of course we paid to have it fixed. And not only does the downstairs bathroom not work but now the second floor bathroom leaks. Oh, and the plumber is an asshole. Why are we talking about this out here? Okay, okay, whatever. We're gonna have to excuse ourselves, go upstairs and move the body. What? That is a horrible idea. Why would we do that? He's in the bathtub. Nick! I had no other choice. I had no other option. It's gonna take us forever to move him and clean it all up. They're gonna hear us. We're on our fourth bottle of wine. At some point, somebody is gonna have to pee and if they can't use the bathroom down here... We'll just distract them. Holly, honey, babe. There's a dead body in the bathtub. How are we gonna distract somebody from that? I don't know. But don't you think that if we're gone for 30 minutes someone's gonna come looking for us to see what's wrong. Why would you put them in the bathroom? What was I supposed to do? This wouldn't be a problem if your parents weren't so nosy. I don't know, maybe not in a room that old people use 30 times a day. Why are you arguing with me? Maybe because you put a dead guy in the guest bathroom when we have guests. You're the one who brought him in the house. You're the one who knocked him over and killed him. I did not kill him, the bell killed him. And you're the reason why we can't go to the police. No, no, no, the reason we can't go to the police is because of that idiot who filmed the video. Jesús even said I'm a nice person. Who's Jesús? The dead guy in the bathroom. Whatever! Point is we have to go upstairs and move him. Absolutely not. We're not touching anything until they leave and we come up with a plan. We're just gonna have to tell them that everyone's gonna have to use the master bathroom, okay? They won't go in there if we ask them not to. They won't, come on. Okay, okay, okay, fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Well, Rudy's an accountant. So obviously that was a nine to five job for many years until he started his own firm. Then it got to be more flexible. But you know, my hours are just all over the place. I pretty much survive on no sleep. What do you do? I'm a doctor. I do a lot of ER work and also some scheduled surgeries. So interesting. What drew you to that career? Well, when I was young I developed a gluten allergy and it just seemed like it took so long for any of the doctors to diagnose me. I was just so sick and every doctor I went to just said, eat bland foods like toast, crackers and pasta. All of them have gluten. And then when I found out, I thought, now, there's some dumb doctors out there. And how about I try to be a smart one? Oh, and by the way, we have a delicious gluten-free cake mom. You're gonna love it. I promise you this place makes the best cakes. Cake sounds great. 'Cause you know, on our wedding night I didn't get a chance eat any of my cake. It had gluten. That's because I was in charge of ordering it. Well, that's alright baby. I married you anyway. What do you two guys do? Well, I used to be the buyer for Macy's women's summer catalog but I retired once Holly went off to college. Well, that makes perfect sense because you're just so fashionable and stylish. Thank you. Holly, can you pass me the knife? Oh, I got it. Thank you. You know, I really do enjoy retirement. I have more time for hobbies, vacations. It's great. And what do you do Joe? I work in the Sheriff's department. You're a cop? Yeah. You know, that's-that's- - Holly, you didn't tell me that. I told you he worked in the government. That's just not what I thought that meant. Well, it's not like I'm out there pulling people who are over speeding. I work on some of the tougher cases, the manslaughter, homicides. I'm not quite a detective but I work very closely with the detectives. That's great. I gotta go do some upstairs, something. But just save me a piece of cake. What do you have to do Nick? I have to go clean something up. Can't that wait till later? Nope. I don't know why he's acting a little bit strange tonight. Maybe he had to change his shirt again. Anybody want more water? Is he taking a shower? You know what? Where is the music? Okay, okay. I'll be right back. Where's the bathroom? Holly! You said the bathroom down here is broken? Mm-hm You have one that works? Yeah. So, the second floor bathroom is also broken. So everyone's gonna have to use the master bathroom. Honey, two of your bathrooms are broken? Yeah. We were supposed to get it fixed but there was a problem with the plumber... It's just that you have guests. I know mom. Can you just point me in the direction of a bathroom that works? Yeah. So, the master bathroom is actually on the third floor. Hey honey, which one of these is the bathroom? Is it this one? Oh, that one's broken dad. Oh, it's broken? Yeah. What do you mean broken? The toilet doesn't flush. How long has it been like that? Two days maybe. Is it a faulty flush valve or? I don't know. Well, why don't you let me take a look at it. I really don't want to go up another set of stairs. You know how my back gets. No dad, I wouldn't... What? I just don't want you to mess with it and make it even worse. Holly, your old man knows how to fix a toilet. But dad don't. Why not? Oh, hey guys. I was just cleaning. Okay. If it makes you so uncomfortable I guess I can use the one upstairs. You know what? I wouldn't want you to hurt your back so you can just try fixing this one here. The one downstairs. Or the one downstairs. That one is really broken. And you know what? This one is messy. I wouldn't want you to... Holly, I'm not your mother, all right? I don't care about a little mess. No dad. I need to tell you something. What? I need to tell you something downstairs. Okay. Well, give me a minute in here. Let me take a look at it, I'll do my business and then I'll meet you downstairs. No, I need to tell you right now. What? What is it? Nick has cancer. What! No, I don't have cancer. But we don't know for sure. I'm like 90% sure that I don't have cancer. But there's still a chance. There's like a 10% chance. I'm really sorry to hear that Nick. Can we talk about this after? 'Cause right now I just need to... No dad, don't. Holly, a little space please. It seems to be working fine. Holly, honey, is everything alright? Yeah mom. What are you guys doing in here? Dad just fixed the toilet. Oh, wonderful. Well, it wasn't actually broken. Nick? Yeah mom. Nicholas? Nicholas? Yeah, mom. Are you having a tour up there? No, no, no, no, no, no one is getting a tour. Holly's dad just needed to use the bathroom. Eve already went up there I don't want us to be the only one not getting a tour now But no one's getting a tour. Why not? Rudy, don't you wanna see the rest of the house? I'm dying to. Well, I don't want you to die, so go ahead. I'm gonna sit here and turn on the TV. I should've expected that. Mom, no, no, no, no. Stay down here. Stay down here. Come back. Just come back downstairs. There you are. Well, this place is great. I like the bathroom. Is it time for the tour? A tour? Now? Yes honey, I want a tour. Why would we wait? Mary let's look around. Okay. Did Nick tell you to come up here? Oh, no. Don't worry about him. I love this study. Hey, so this floor is the guest room and guest bath with an office. Is the master upstairs? It has to be. Let's go. Oh, let's go. Wait. And I'm gonna use the bathroom and I'll be right up. Dad, just hurry up. Nick, are you coming? Don't mind me dad. Just doing a little house-keeping. Good morning everyone. Good morning. Wow! This is incredible. Hey, do you mind if I look around? Year, sure. Go ahead. Mom. What? This bedroom is lovely. Did you decorate it yourself? Yeah, I did. Thanks. What a cute dresser. Pottery Barn? Neiman Marcus? It's Ikea. Oh, you going for that whole minimalistic lifestyle. I saw a documentary about that. I'm not really going for anything mom. Did you change the color of the walls when you guys moved in? No. Yeah, I see that. Are you gonna add some rugs or some matching curtains? No, I- It didn't really cross my mind. I really wish we could have seen the place before I bought your Christmas gift. I could have really helped you out with this. Holly, I know you have some trouble with this kind of thing. Mom. What? Can you stop doing that? I'm not a kid. Oh, don't be so dramatic. I'm not doing anything. I'm just trying to help you start your future. Look dear, people only respect you as much as you respect yourself. Now, you might not realize the gravity of that just yet but one day you will. Now, it's Christmas and you have guests. Don't make that face. Now, let's go see this bathroom. Oh, this is beautiful. What's in here? It's beautiful. So much storage space. Hey, that looks like Holly. God knows you do it every morning while some of us are trying to sleep. Oh, don't you have something more productive to be doing? That's funny. Get away from me. Actually, I need to use the bathroom too, do you guys mind? Just get out! Holly White You lied to me. You told me this was up on display in your office. And the engagement party? Well, we decided to... Everybody is traveling and it's just so busy. Hey mom, so how was the tour? I'm so, so happy Nicholas. And that bedroom it's astonishing. Thank you. That cake was delicious. I think I'm gonna finish it and then I think that it might be time for bed. That sounds like a great plan. Well, I'm going to bed. I guess we'll see you in the morning. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight honey. Hey, Merry Christmas. Goodnight guys. Goodnight. All right honey, lets go up to the bed. Mom wait, you don't have to... I'm gonna be right here. I won't go upstairs, I'm comfortable right here. You two guys can sleep in your own bed. 'Cause I don't want to trek upstairs. But you could sleep in the bed upstairs. Nicholas, you have an Advent wreath. I didn't see that before. I'm so proud of you Nicholas. Okay, well I'm going up then. Nice call. Thanks. We're gonna have to move him. Nick. I feel like they know. As long as he's in the house we're not gonna feel safe. What makes you think that? I think your dad saw the blood in the bathroom. No, he would have asked us if he did. No. He's your dad, he would do anything to protect you. I just met him a couple of hours ago. He's gonna think I'm a psychopath. Okay. Well, what are you thinking? We wait an hour or two. When everyone's asleep, we move him to the trunk of my car and I drive him out to the coast and you stay here. I'll get rid of him and you'll never have to worry about it again. Can't we just wait till they leave? No. They're here for what, another day or two? Who's to say they won't come up here snooping around again? At least if he's gone and your dad's suspects anything, there's no evidence. Okay, fine. But we're not waiting for just two hours. My dad stays awake way too long for that. We're waiting four. Okay, fine. Nicholas? Talk to her! Talk to her! Hey mom. What are you doing awake? I just came to get some water but I see that you're doing something so I'm gonna... No, no, that's okay. This is for your dad. Oh, okay. Well, I'm gonna head back up. Don't you want your water? No, actually I'm kinda tired so I'm gonna go back to sleep. Why do you have on shoes? Oh, my feet were... ...cold. I'm gonna go back up mom. Goodnight. I'll see you in the morning. Get some rest, okay? What are you guys doing? Shh! It's a surprise. Surprise me. Dad, it's for tomorrow. Something really weird has been going on. Nothing weird is going on here. Nick! Don't lie to me. Dad, we're not lying, okay? We're nervous. Right? We're getting married, we've never met each other's families before, wouldn't you be nervous? Nothing weird is going on dad. We're just preparing a surprise for tomorrow. It's Christmas. Okay. We'll see. Surprise. Surprise. Tomorrow. Tomorrow, yep. Goodnight. Goodnight dad. Nick, what is that? Dad, shh! Go back to sleep. There's nothing, it's just a surprise. Oh, okay. What do we do? I don't know. I don't know. We put him back in the trunk, we leave him in there and we lock it. There's no latch. Oh my God, Nick! Nick, your photo. What about it? We put him on the roof. We have roof access, right? We can just leave him up there until they're gone. I already thought about that but I tried, we gotta go through the attic and I couldn't lift him by myself. Babe, but you didn't try it with me. Do you think we're going to jail? I don't know. We can always run away. I don't think our parents are gonna find him up here. Yeah. You think we can leave him up here? Yeah, we could for a little while but eventually someone's gonna come looking for him. Yeah. We should just take all of our cash and just leave. Where do you wanna go? We could go back to the South of France. Get a little house on that hill overlooking the ocean. We could retire early. And do nothing but sip espresso and people watch. And go lay out on the beach and just soak up all the sun. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like the life. We can't afford that. I know. Well, no matter what happens, I love you. I love you too. Nice call, moving the body. You saved us. No, you saved us by getting your dad off my back. Thank you. Well, on the bright side, I think our parents like each other. Who knew? Who knew. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Can I ask you something? You're really religious, aren't you? What do you mean? I mean, you never told me that you we're but your parents are here talking about the church that you used to go to and the candle thingy, the picture of the cathedral. I wish we could get married there. Look, I'm not really religious but I don't want you to feel ashamed. Do you even think we'll be able to get married? It could be something small, just the two of us and the minister. And then we can turn ourselves in? And then we can turn ourselves in. I'm so happy that you're the person I'm marrying. Me too. Hey. Wait, wait, can we talk. Merry Christmas. Is he gonna be okay? He has a pulse. He's gonna need some stitches but he'll be okay. I checked for a pulse but I guess I did it wrong. Well, this certainly is a surprise. I told you something weird was going on. Dad. Holly, I don't wanna hear it. And Nick, you two are in a lot of trouble, okay? You realize he's probably gonna call the police, press charges. I know I would. Holly dear, you invited a random street man into the house while Nick was gone. Mom, his name is Jesús. He's not a street man, he's an architect that volunteers during the holidays. I'm just saying you shouldn't invite every Santa Claus from the mall into your home for milk and cookies. Mom. You can't be behaving like this. You're adults for crying out loud. You two are grounded. What do you mean grounded? He means you should be punished. We're not kids anymore mom. You're acting like kids. This man has a life. He has a family wondering where he is on Christmas morning. All life is sacred. Nicholas you know that! It's okay, it's okay. You need to rest. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. I'm a doctor. Where am I? Hey. Hey, it's me Holly. We met the other day. I invited you here for... Cookies. Yeah. You're still here actually. There was a really bad accident and a misunderstanding. What time is it? 6:30 in the morning. Oh, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Listen Jesús, we hurt you really, really badly on accident. We thought you were dead. And we didn't know what to do. We panicked. And everybody in town's angry at Holly for the video and we're sorry. Wait, it's 6:30? Yeah. I wanna go see my daughter before I start my shift. Honey no, no, no, no. Honey, honey, no, no, no, no. Shift? No, you need stitches and some rest. And if you wanna press charges for what we did to you I think it's... I'm really glad you're gonna be okay. Well, of course I would press charges but it's Christmas and I want to have a happy day. And if you're not all happy, how can I be? So you're not gonna call the police? There's not a day in the year when people give more. Can I just do my shift and get the stitches after? They're always short-staffed on Christmas and... Oh shoot, I'm gonna need a new costume. They'll replace it with a brand new one. Real fur too. And they'll pay for your stitches. And any other related medical expenses. Also, would you and your daughter like to join us for dinner tonight? I'm making my casserole and I can make some extra. Thank you. But we were supposed to go over to my brother's house after my shift. Your shift? Don't worry about your shift, okay? I think I know someone that can cover it. Merry Christmas. Merry Chri... Happy, okay. Babe, I don't... Maybe I should go inside, maybe it's me. Okay well, then go inside. Babe... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. We need money guys. Yeah, we do. A lot. Yeah. It is your parents' fault. It is not. It is your parents fault. Merry Chri... Oh, come on! Hey, relax. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Babe, we gotta pay for our almost-murder. I'm not paying for anything. You're the one that did it. I did not. - Yes, you did. - I did not! It's your fault. You let him in the house. You shut it. I went to go get you a cake. All right, okay. Oh, Joseph White. This bag is beautiful. Well, you did send me the link to buy it. I know. Thank you. Whatever. I can't wait to marry you. And I can't wait to marry you. Dinner is almost ready guys. Absolutely. It smells delicious. And why don't we take a look at the house first? Real funny dad.
