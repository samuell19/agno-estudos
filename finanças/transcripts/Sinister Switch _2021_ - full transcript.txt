Come on. Come on... You can do this... Hey! No! Where are you going? You can't go! Please take us... I'm sorry. Hey, get away from the window. I do. I think it could be that big. The manuscript will need a heavy polish, And we'll get legal to do some fact-checking, But the content, it's incredible. A true story from both the mother and daughter's perspective... With good word of mouth, this could be a blockbuster. Every mom on the beach will be sunburnt Because she couldn't put it down. I'm glad you said that because I'm just about to walk into A production meeting on the cover art. We'll talk soon. Maurice wanted something a bit more traditional for the jacket, Like heidi's confessions. But... I talked him off that ledge. Yeah, I think this one is on-point. The material is so zeitgeisty. Mother saves her daughter from being a web cam girl For human traffickers. It's unreal. Yeah. This can work. Great, that's what I thought too. I... Just got off the phone with page forward international publishing. They're including it in their summer book club. And it looks like we're gonna have our pick For which morning show gets an exclusive segment With mother and daughter. It'll be a big deal. As long as... What. I just... I can't stop thinking About those last few chapters. They're good, right? Yeah. Too good, maybe. We have to cover ourselves. The mother's entire rescue story hinges on Some pretty big coincidences. Especially towards the end. But coincidences happen though, right? And she has her daughter back, so we know it's a happy ending. Not with stories like this. If it seems to good to be true... I'll make some calls. Olivia? Olivia? That's why I'm asking. Don't worry about telling me what I want to hear, Just lay it out for me. The truth is far more important. Oh, I'm sorry... No, I'm... I'm glad you reached out. Yeah, I'm sure a lot of parents will still find it inspiring. Let me think about it. I'm sorry... Thanks. So it was all a lie? No, but she didn't even get there Until the day after the police found the warehouse. Then how can we believe any of it? Listen, this is on me. I got caught up in her story, too. And believe me, I should know better. Maybe we can re-work those last chapters. But the last chapters are the book. Yeah. You're right. I've got a few things for the fall I could try to bump up. Into the current. It's a debut novel, Sort of flowery, but lots of sex... Described by someone who has definitely never had it. Let me figure something out. You okay? Yeah. It's all part of the job, anne. Honestly. It makes me so mad she would do this to us. It's not about us. They went through something horrible. She's just trying to take back some control over what happened. I never thought of it that way. It's not easy living with the idea that you've failed your daughter. Kristen cosentino. Mmm hm. Oh my god... kristen...? Where did you find her? Someone picked her up off highway 7 And brought her to the station. She escaped but can't tell us where the house is located. Apparently it was the second ride she hitched, So the search grid right now is pretty wide. Where is she? Justin, where is she? She's with a social worker. We just have to wait. I can't wait! My god! I... - Justin, I don't understand... - I know. I know. Hi. I'm detective simmons. Are you mrs. Holtom? We're seperated. Can we see her? - I have to see her. - Soon, I promise. - Come in my office. - Okay. Did you conduct a physical? We did. And? Just a few cuts and bruises from walking through the woods. Umm... When can we take her home? Soon. After the psych eval and the social worker wraps up. We think the other four girls who were kidnapped During that period are at the same location. Most of the details she's given so far are pretty vague. More might come back to her after the shock wears off. In the meantime, maybe you can help. Memory exercises often do work best in a safe home environment. We know these things take time, but in this case, we do need to push a little bit harder. Six years. She won't be the same daughter we lost. Hey, hey. Don't... Don't think about that. We have her back. Let's... Let's focus on that. I can't bear to think what she's been through. Your parents are just down here. Olivia? Do you want something to eat? You must be hungry. I have some pasta I could heat up. Or soup? I could heat that up, But you want something fresh, I'm sure. I'm sorry. I'm just... Whatever you need, we're here for you, alright? Yes, whatever you need. If you want to just wander around... A little has changed, But your room is still there. I mean of course... But we could bring your stuff up. I'm really sorry, it just got... So, umm... We can talk about that another time. You look so grown up. Can I get you something to drink maybe? Lemonade? Okay. Lemonade it is. What is wrong with me? Hey, it's fine. It's a lot to handle. How are you so calm right now? I'm in stressful situations for a living. This is different. It is. And I'm feeling a lot. But... Hey. We need to be even keel for her sake. She's not the little girl we knew. What's that supposed to mean? It means she's been through a lot. Okay? I should heat up the pasta in case she changes her mind. Hey, it's fine. Seriously. Hey, I've got your drink. I've got an extra toothbrush you can use, And some p.J.'s. I know you probably don't want to wear your mom's p.J.'s but... Olivia? Olivia? - Olivia? - Olivia? Olivia?! Hey. She's in the spare. Walked right by her. Maybe she forgot which room was hers. This the '09 from sicily? It is. She's so quiet. Yeah, I know. I remember her coming home from school Bursting with jokes and stories. She's been through a lot. Do you think she's upset that I moved all her stuff to the basement? Nah, I don't think so. I mean... I think she'll come to understand. You can blame me. I did push to do it. I just... I just didn't know how else to get past the pain. Sorry. It doesn't quite feel real, does it? Yeah. I've spent so much time Reconciling with the fact that I would never see her again. I'm sorry that I... Sorry I pushed so hard for you to do the same. - It's hard for both of us. - Yeah. I just... I didn't want to see you suffer. I know. I can't even enjoy this right now. Okay good, it's not just me. I should at least try to sleep. I'm more afraid of waking up. This isn't a dream, right? No, it's not. I can stay, if you want. It's fine. You sure? It feels wrong to leave. It's what happened. Yeah... Honestly, she'll probably sleep until mid-afternoon, anyway. Well, if anything happens, or you just want to talk, Call me and I'll be here, alright? Okay. See you tomorrow. I'll bring... Food. Morning. Morning, baby. It's so good to hear your voice. Did you sleep okay? Well, I took some time off work, so we can do anything you want. Shopping? A movie? Eat candy until we feel sick? Is dad still sleeping? He's actually, umm... Not here right now. So he went to work? No. But he'll be back really soon. Don't worry. How about breakfast? Sorry. I'm not that hungry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to do. It's been so long. Yum yum. Yum yum! Pee yew! I kept everything. Are you upset I packed up your room? Is that why you slept in the spare? I was just... Confused. I need you to know that I wasn't trying to forget you. It's important that you know that. I do have to apologize though because, umm... I read your diary. A lot. Let's just say the pages started getting so worn, That I was using tweezers to turn them. Aww! Your guy... Steven! I know even at ten you were saying That you were too old for steven, but... I secretly snuggled him at bedtime. Honestly, I was just boxing up my feelings. It's okay, mom. Look. Your teeth. I'm sorry. Are... Are you okay? Can we go back upstairs? Okay. Being down here reminds me of... - Of course. Of course! Yes. Come on, let's go. Oh woooah... I brought lunch. You did! Thank you! Hey, sweetheart. Sorry. My favorite. Yeah. So, sounds like you two had a good morning. What? Oh, nothing. Okay, okay. Keep your secrets. Justin! What? She was about to eat shrimp. You didn't tell them she had an allergy? I did. They must have... Forgot. Honey? Honey, it's okay. Are you okay? How's your throat? Can you please just tell me that you're okay? I'm okay. Don't be mad. Oh, honey, why would we be mad? Your dad didn't mean to scare you. I-I-I'm sorry I grabbed you. That was... That was wrong. I was just trying to keep you safe. I love you more than anything, you know that. He used to grab us... I guess we were kinda like his dolls. Honey, I'm so sorry. Olivia, I'm very sorry For all of it. I'm sorry we couldn't protect you. And I'm sorry I brought you right back there. Please... Forgive me. Sorry I'm so tired. You don't have to apologize about anything. It's been a long day. You need your rest. Dad? Yeah? You'll be here when I wake up, right? Of course he will, honey. Yeah. Of course. This is all I ever wanted. And I got my wish. You sure you're okay with this? Yeah, it's what she wants. But do you want me staying over? It has been nice having you around. It was so lonely in this house for so many years. It's been nice having you both back. Honestly, I thought the same thing So I packed a bag in case. How presumptuous! Well, I just thought, you know, that with olivia, we should... No, justin. I'm just teasing you. It's okay. Right. Has she said anything about... Anything? No, not yet. But she will. I know she will. There's a lot of pressure from the other parents, so... Well, that's a job for the police. Our job is to love our daughter. Yeah. Are you sure you don't want to sleep in the spare? Come on. This thing got me through med school. Night. Night. Oh... Sorry, baby, you scared me. Can I sleep with you tonight? Like I used to? Of course. Did you have a bad dream? Do you want to tell me about it? I was back in the basement, And he was dragging me around. You're here now. And you're safe. It's... It's like living in a dream. I can't even imagine. Is she okay? I guess so. She's been through hell. We had a good day yesterday but it'll be a long road. I'm so happy for you and justin. Has she told you anything about... Not yet, and we're not pushing her. Totally. How's everything going there? Do you need me to come in? No! Please. Don't worry about us. We've got you covered. Take the time you need to worry about your family. - Focus on that. - Yeah, you're right. I'm just used to rushing into work when I feel like this. We won't run this place into the ground, I promise. Maurice is on a reading frenzy. He has ten new ideas every day. I'll let you know if he has a good one. Thanks anne. Hey. I think I know what we can do. But look, if you don't want to say What happened with the girls, that's fine. Alright? The quicker this is done, The easier it's gonna be on everyone. Hey! Would you like coffee? Everything okay down here? Yeah. Are we still going shopping today? Sure, if that's what you want. I definitely don't want to wear my mom's clothes forever. Oh. Thank you. I wanted to see how you all were doing. I think we're doing okay, right honey? Now that you've had a chance to be home, I wanted to see if there were any Other memories that have come up. It's only been a day. I realize. But anything you can tell us That could help us find those other girls. Like what the house looked like, What your captor looked like. I think she's still processing everything. I appreciate that. I really do. But those other girls are still out there. And olivia is our best chance to find them. I don't know anything about the other girls. He kept us separated. Okay. It's okay, olivia. But if there's anything you can tell us about him Or his house, that would help. Like, you said you ran from the house into a forest. What kind of trees were in the forest? Did they have leaves? Were they pine trees? Was the ground rocky or flat? Kind of... Rocky? Maybe? That's good. That really helps us. That really does. Now you said there was a truck in the driveway. "A muddy black truck." Do you remember the make or model? It was a truck. I don't know models of trucks. Can we slow down, detective? Olivia, you said when you ran out of the forest, The first road was paved. - Like, hard and flat? - I know what paved means. There's just so few farmhouses near paved roads near here. Well, that's good for you, right? Well, we thought so. But we've checked all those houses for miles. Now, are you sure it wasn't perhaps a gravel road? She's only trying to help you remember. You think I want to remember? Any of it? I don't want to think about that place ever again! I'm sorry, I didn't want to upset her. It's just that we really need to find those other girls. I'm here whenever you're ready. Just me. You know what I do remember, I don't trust. I thought the road was paved, but she says it's not. The exercises we have will help. I promise. Who wants to play with blocks? You're afraid of a sports team not making the playoffs? Ever making the playoffs. It's pretty dire. What? I thought we should start small. Yup. I'm afraid of Walking under scaffolding during construction. I always think something's going to fall on my head. Hard hat for christmas, noted. Your turn, sweetie. Small things. Whatever comes to mind. I'm afraid of going to sleep at night. Okay, that's, uh... and of being grabbed by someone. Okay. We should stop and talk about it... And I'm afraid of not having a family and being all alone. That's not gonna happen. I promise you that I won't... It already has! You and dad aren't together anymore. Do you think I'm stupid? We're not a family. I know that this is hard, and it's not fair to you, But we love you, and we will always be a family. No matter what. Is she okay? You okay? Can we go shopping now? Think this is enough of a bribe for her To finally talk to me again? Stop it. Grabbing her wrist was triggering. It's not your fault. It's her allergy. I was scared. I know. But maybe she grew out of it. That can happen, right? It can, yeah. But... What? Nothing... What happened this morning? I guess I asked her a question she didn't like. Justin, how many times do we have to do this? Seriously, she's fragile. I know. It's the doctor in me. So... What did you ask her? About the other girls. How well she knew them. If there was someone to talk to down there. Maybe I was looking for a little consolation, I don't know. I didn't get it. I know you're talking about me. You don't have to hide it. O-olivia. Olivia! Beth? There were all these rumors that you were back. But no one knew for sure. We were trying to take things slow. But we're so happy to see you again, beth. You too, mrs. Holtom. Time to heed your own advice and give them space. We went to the mall today. Olivia, why don't you show beth what we got? Me and the girls cross that little bridge Every single day after gymnastics, But it's been, like, forever since I've actually gone shopping. Well you'll have to come with us next time. Hot pretzels, on me. Okay. If you need anything, we'll be here. Do you think they're okay? They're fine. We're right here. Yeah, it's... It's just she's never... I think it might be too soon. Oh hey, hey... It'll be good for her to see an old friend. Right? Yeah. It's fine. I know it's stupid, but... Hopefully you like it. It's, um... Signed By all the girls from our old gymnastics team. Stacey moved away a couple years ago, But everyone else. Oh, and... Shanti made you this. Shanti. Does she still stick her butt out When she does her floor routine? Yeah, she totally does. Like a llama in spandex. That's what we used to call her, right? Spandex llama. You look so different. I mean... I guess I look different, too. Yeah. Everyone looks different after six years. That's how it works. What is that? It's nothing. Sorry. I think we just have to keep reminding ourselves that It's a process. She's grown up. All those years I dreamed of having her home, I never... I just hate seeing her like this. Yeah. It's work. I should... Sure. - Hey, anne. - Is this a good time? Yeah, we're good. She's got an old friend over. How's that going? We're trying to give them some space. You coming back to school? Don't really want to. Really? Why? Everybody misses you. I don't want to deal with people asking me The same questions over and over again. Looking at me like that. Like what? That! The pity. I'm just looking at you. I haven't seen you in so long. It's weird for me too. Weird? What are you saying? You're going to go around telling people How much I've changed? Like I'm some sort of freak now? W-what? No! I just... I did change. And I got real friends. The girls in there, they understood me. You're only trying to use me so you can run back to school And act like you know the crazy girl that was locked up forever. How's everything over there? Good. Great, actually. I think I have a solution for that gap in the spring calendar. The team loves it. What's the pitch? It's your story... Beth? Sorry, anne, I'm gonna have to call you back. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm gonna go, ahh... So what did you two talk about? Beth! - I'm fine. - Hey, what happened? Beth, it's okay. We were... Everything was fine, I thought... But then she said I was using her, And that her real friends were the girls that she was with. Girls? The ones... That she was with... At the place. Look, olivia's been through a lot. She's been hurt in ways that we'll never understand. You don't take it to heart. She just needs time. It's probably just too soon. She's not the same. - Yeah, I know. - No. I mean, I don't think she's the same person. That's not olivia. Everything alright? I think beth said some pretty insensitive things. Like what? We don't have to go over it again right now. Beth seemed to have a different take on what happened. Oh? Are you taking her side? What...? No. No, I'm... I'm only saying... Saying what? Not the time? Yeah, sorry. Sorry, ollie. You said "ollie." Yeah. You haven't since I've been back. It's fine. Just... Beth did say some stuff I can't shake. Like? Like about olivia's relationship to the other girls in there. Said they were close. Okay...? That's not what she told us. Yeah, okay, what are you trying to do here? What? You're trying to poke holes in our daughter's story? No. No, I'm trying to understand. Look, I-I know she's changed, but... Has she changed too much? Beth doesn't even... Can you even, for one second, Imagine what the last six years has done to her? Why are you guys whispering? We're just saying goodnight. Goodnight, sweetheart. Goodnight. Come on, mom. No. No. No. - No! - Olivia. Hey. Olivia! No, no. Get go of me. Let go! Stop it! Olivia! Olivia. Olivia! Olivia! No, no, stop. Stop. You're home. It's okay. You're home. So, olivia, What do say we invite detective simmons over again? Why? So I can relive every detail of my worst nightmare? Yeah, that's fair. - Olivia... - She's a police officer, She needs details to do her job and help find the other girls. She's so stupid. Why doesn't she just find them herself? I can't help her. One second, this must be important. But I want to talk about this. Hey. Sorry to bug you again. No, not at all. Is everything okay? Yeah. I mean, not really. There's still some damage control happening From a daughter lost and found, But we have a fix that should calm the partners With a simple press release. We think it could be big, and we know it's solid. Great. Shoot. Do you think you'll talk to beth again? When I spoke to her, she told me that Your real friends were in there with you. In that place. But you told us and the detective You were separated from the other girls. You know, it's surprising the kind of little details That can break a case like this. Maybe there's something that you... Misremembered? Or... Maybe there's something you forget to tell us? Are you calling me a liar? I already hired a ghostwriter to start on the outline. Ghostwriter? Why? Well, you've been so busy it probably never even occured to you. It's about a woman who's daughter went missing six years ago And shows up out of the blue. And we both know this story isn't too good to be true. I just... Want to help you remember. Remembering is the worst thing you could make me do. Everyone wants me to remember and all I want to do is forget. God, she's so nosy, I hate her so much. Who? The detective? She's just doing her j... - Hey, where are you going? - I'm going on a walk. - Wait. Olivia, I'm sorry. - Don't follow me. Kristen? Are you there? If we can put an announcement in the trades... No. Too rushed, okay. But the rights to this story alone Will make up for the shortfall this summer. Anne, I have to go. Okay, sorry. I'll handle it. What happened? Where is she? Where'd she go? I asked her questions. She stormed out. You let her leave alone? I can't exactly force her to stay in the house. What kind of questions were you asking? About the other girls. Katie, something doesn't add up. I don't want to say it out loud. - Then don't. No, kristen. Listen! If she's not olivia, That means olivia is still out there somewhere. Just like that. Must be so embarrassing. Look, you're totally doing it right now! That's why she only remembers your butt! You just can't stop talking about me, can you? No, I was teasing her. I do it all the time. You know what happens to girls who talk too much? - Justin? - -yeah, I'm here. Justin, I... I can't find her. Anything? Not yet. Justin! Don't worry, we'll find her. I'm right near the house. I'll circle back around. We need to find her, no matter what. Do we call the police? Not yet. Umm... Let me check one last place. Hey. What are you doing here? You ran away. You can't do that. That's not running away. I just needed some space. I was scared. Do you have any idea how scared I was? What, you think I'm gonna to get kidnapped, again? Maybe, yeah. Maybe I thought you were gonna hurt yourself. I don't know what's going on. What are you doing down here? Why is your coat all dirty? - I fell. It's nothing. - Hey. Slow down. I'm going home. Isn't that what you wanted? - No, I want to talk to you. - What do you want me to say? That I'm not happy? That I wanted to come home to two parents? Two parents who were still together, And in love, and waiting for me? I know. He could have killed me for running away, but I ran! I know, honey. I left them all behind, And I ran! I'm alive! And I'm here! Why can't you love me for who I am now? I do. I do love you. I promise. She okay? Great... I'm going to shower and then go to bed. Okay, no problem, sweetie. Okay then. Good night. What if we're just being paranoid? We thought seeing her again was impossible. Of course it doesn't feel real. Let's just get the police to do a blood test. No, I can't do that to her. Not after everything she's been through. She doesn't have to know. I'll know, justin. And I'll never forgive myself if we're wrong. But what if olivia is still out there somewhere. Give me until tomorrow. I have to do this the right way. Okay? Do I have a choice? I thought someone was in the house. I heard a noise and I got scared. I'm sorry. It's okay. You should probably go back to bed. Can I sleep in here with you, mommy? Sure. Of course. Are you scared of me or something? No. I'm just giving you your space. That's what you wanted, right? Goodnight. Night. Dr. Holtom? Detective? Is everything okay? We need to talk. You brought breakfast. What? Uh, oh yeah. It's... It's probably cold, though. As long as you didn't cook it, I'll eat it. Uh, no. Where's...? Um... upstairs. What is it? I just saw detective simmons outside. Beth was assaulted yesterday. - Oh no! - By her. At the bridge near the mall. Beth's parents aren't pressing charges Because they know what she's been through. But, kristen... - I know. - -what do you know? That... We should get going because I have A special day planned for you. Ah, umm... Are you sure? Yeah! Come on, olivia. Just the two of us? - Yeah. - -no. I think we need some real mother-daughter bonding time. Ahh, are you sure? All this... Girls-only chats are starting to feel a little discriminatory. - Well, tough. - C'mon. We'll be back... Don't worry. Let's go. Where? It's winter. It's beautiful outside. You used to love the cold. That's a lie. Nobody loves the cold. Come on! You used to love coming here. You'd pretend that you'd discovered the ruins Of an ancient city. You remember that? Thought it might be nice to hang out here and relax. Make you feel safe. Thanks. It does. It must have been so scary. I know what it was like for me, but I still can't imagine - What it was like for you. - Don't do this. I don't want to talk about it. Talking about it won't make me feel better. I need to talk about it. I need to feel better. Losing a child... It changes everything. It changes the way you look at the world. The way you look at other people. Then you get them back and you find a new love You never knew you had. Yeah. I love you, too, mom. Glad being here is making you happy. So many happy memories. Yeah. Running around with uncle lucas in the field. Yeah. That time you took your sled down that hill And broke your arm. Yeah, that was crazy. That time you were taken away by a stranger. What? This is the place my daughter was taken Six years ago, may 22nd. You sure know a lot about her, but not everything. She doesn't have an uncle lucas and she never broke her arm. Do you know where she is? Which one are you? Rebecca forster? Lindsay spencer? You must be one of the seaton five, You know too much about them. You... You must know what happened. Are they alive? Is olivia still alive? Tell me what you know! Tell me what you know! I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. I forgot. - You're just like him. You just want to use me. No, not at all. I just... If olivia is still alive, You have to tell me. I don't know. She was, but... But what? What does that mean? - Where is she? - I don't know. I can't help you then. Maybe the police... Wait! Wait! What about me? Where do I belong? You got parents out there somewhere And they're worried sick, missing you. No, they're not. Yes, they are! Just because you were taken away Doesn't mean that they don't love you. We let olivia out of our sight for a split-second, and she... It's a parent's worst nightmare. We would do anything to get her back. Someone out there is missing you like that, too. That's where you belong. With them. Fine. Yeah, take me home. Of course. - Of course, honey... - Right now. Take me home to my family, and... Then you'll understand. I'll take you home. - What are you doing? - It's justin. Let me tell him what's going on. - No! I only trust you with this, please. If I don't answer, he'll worry. I won't say anything yet, okay. Justin? Hey, it's fine. No, we're still at the park. I'll call you back in a bit, okay? Thanks. What's your name? Your real name. - Natalie. - Natalie. Natalie. The press didn't know about you, did they? They never mentioned you in the papers. How should I know? What are your parents' names, natalie? I only know my dad. - But he's... - What's his name? John. It's been a while. Do you think he's still living At the same address? Yeah. I do. He's gonna be really excited to see you. I promise. I know it might feel like... Might've been his fault that you were taken away, Like he let you down, But I swear that's not the case. Your love for your kids, it... Beats everything. There, that's it. Turn here. Is that it? Yeah. You want me to come with you? Olivia was my favorite, you know. The other girls just thought they could get stuff from me. She was my friend. What do you mean get stuff out of you? When I brought their food, I always gave her The least burnt piece of toast And cookies with the most chocolate chips. I took good care of her, I promise. Natalie. Where are we? Home. Since I was five, when he brought me here. I was the only one who was allowed to call him dad. Oh god... Is this where she is? Is she in there right now? Did you really mean what you said? Yes. Do you think he'll be happy to see me again? Oh, natalie. My olivia. Is she in there right now? Is she alive? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Please tell me what that means? He took her away. I don't know. That's why I left. We have to get the police, okay? Wait. He's not here. His truck's gone. He's never gone for very long And when he gets back... Now you said there was a truck in the driveway. "A muddy black truck." already got your license plate and I'm calling the cops. Who are you? I'm sorry. Anne? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This is jared. He's the writer I hired. I've been showing him around the neighborhood so he could start Pulling together a first draft of the book. What book? About us? Kristen never said anything about a book. She's got so much going on. I don't think she's seeing things clearly. No, she's fine. Yeah? Where is she now? In there. You're sure he's not here? Do you know the code? What day is it today? The 15th. No, the 16th. He changes it everyday. Today's date in reverse, then 6-5-5. He never figured out. Is there another way in? Olivia? Is this where he kept you? Olivia? Do you know where she is? Do you... Do you know where she is? I told you she wasn't here. No. No. We have to go. Quickly. Come on. No. Please come... I'll come back for you. I promise. Where are you taking me? We have to get out of here! But you said he'd be happy to see me. I can't leave you... What's in there? I don't know. Wait! Today's date, reverse, 6-6-5. Come on. 6-6-5. 6-5-5. Olivia? Olivia, baby... Is that you? Mom? Ollie. It's you. It's really you. I knew you'd come. I'm here. I'm never letting you go. Natalie? Come on, let's go. I get it now. You could never love me like that. What are you doing? Let's go. Da-a-ad! I'm over here! Where've you been? I'm sorry. I got scared. Who did you talk to? Huh? Tell me. I didn't talk to anyone. I promise. After all I did to give you a family, you run away? It was all just a dirty trick so I'd trust you. No, I thought I'd be happy someplace else, but... What are you doing back here? Trying to help the others do what you did? No! I thought you'd be happy to see me, dad. Stop calling me that! I never should have treated you better than the others. I thought you were special, but you're not. You're disloyal, just like everyone else. A traitor to the cause. Let go of me! I tried to give you a good home. A home with principles and discipline, Something you and your sisters knew nothing about Until I brought you here! Now I have to teach you all over again. No! I'll be... I'll be good. I promise. Why the hell should I believe the promises of a traitor?! You said I was your daughter. Daughter. You're not my child. You're no one's child. They were glad to get rid of you. Let her go! Stay back. I've already called the police. There's no coverage for miles around this place. There are no police. Any minute, now. Is that so? No. I think I'm going to take my time with you. Six years. You've already token six years from me. Who the hell are you? I'm that girl's mother. She's not your child. Actually... I was talking about her. You stupid girls. Ahh! Come on, let's go. Hey. You, too. I don't have anywhere to go. Yeah, you do. No, in fact there were six girls at that location, Not five. And I can confirm that the suspect And the owner of the property, one john aldiss, Is now in custody. He is not known to police, But a survivor who escaped last week Was able to lead police to the location, And reunite the other girls with their families. Yes, I have the hard copy here.

Grab a seat, your dad is attempting to make eggs. Attempting...? I think our back-to-school shopping will make you feel better. Did you guys hear that? What? That's the sound of my credit cards Screaming in terror. You love that joke. Come and take a seat, sweetheart. Do you really think we're going to laugh at it one day? Laugh at him. It's the only way it's funny. I added salt to this one. Oh, I see. Okay, I can taste the salt now.
