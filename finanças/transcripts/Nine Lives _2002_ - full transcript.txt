LET'S SEE IT. OH, YEAH, THAT WAS IN ITALY. FLORENCE, I THINK. OH, YOU WERE SO SWEET. LET'S SEE. OH! YOUR HAIR WAS SO MUCH LIGHTER THEN. IT GETS LIGHTER IN THE SUMMER. LET'S HAVE A LOOK. YOU WERE A BEAUTIFUL BABY. YEAH? WHAT ABOUT NOW, BABE? YOU'RE STILL MY BABY, BABY. EW. SO, BLONDIE, HOW LONG HAS YOUR FAMILY HAD THIS PLACE? FOREVER. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SCOTTISH. AS SCOTTISH AS FLAT CAPS AND WHIPPETS. YOUR CLAN'S MANCHESTER SCUM, AND YOU KNOW IT. PLEASE NOTICE, EVERYONE, HOW I'M NOT RISING TO THE BAIT. I WENT TO MANCHESTER ONCE. I HAD TO HIDE MY LADY SHAVES TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SLITTING MY WRIST. ANYWAY, YES, MOM AND DAD LIVED IN MANCHESTER FOR YEARS, BUT DAD'S PARENTS WERE FROM HERE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S SO... ISOLATED. ROMANTIC. THERE WAS A VILLAGE NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE, BUT NO ONE'S LIVED THERE FOR YEARS. WHY DID THEY LEAVE? WAS IT THE PLAGUE OR SOMETHING? ALLERGIC REACTION TO HAGGIS. REALLY? BESIDES, WE LIKE THAT IT'S SO ISOLATED. IT'S GOOD TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYTHING. IT'S INCREDIBLY PEACEFUL IN THE SUMMER. NO MOBILES, NO INTERNET, JUST YOU, YOUR THOUGHTS, AND OCCASIONALLY GOOD COMPANY. DON'T GET ME WRONG. I APPRECIATE THE PEACE AND THE QUIET. IT'S JUST... AT LEAST THE TABLOIDS WON'T SNIFF YOU OUT UP HERE. SWEETIE, I'M IN SOME GUTTER RAG TWICE, AND YOU THINK I'M SOME SORT OF SOCIALITE. PETE FRAMED BOTH ISSUES. SO WHEN'S PETE GETTING HERE? UH, HE LEFT LONDON PRETTY EARLY, SO AN HOUR OR 2. WHY DIDN'T HE FLY UP LIKE THE REST OF US? HONEY, YOU KNOW PETER. HE LOVES SAVING A FEW QUID. WELL, COME ON, YOU TWO, YOU KNOW HE CAN'T AFFORD IT. YEAH, PLEASE DON'T START ON THAT AGAIN WHEN HE GETS HERE. I'M JUST SAYING, HE PROBABLY SPENT MORE ON GAS THAN THE PRICE OF THE TICKET. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? REMIND ME, PRINCESS, IS IT--IS IT 5 TESTS YOU'VE FAILED NOW? OR IS IT 6? ALL THOSE ROAD SIGNS ARE TOTALLY CONFUSING. ALL THE LITTLE SHAPES AND COLORS. I MEAN, ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO HELP? BESIDES, I HAVE YOU TO DRIVE ME AROUND, RIGHT, HONEY? YEAH. ME AND EVERYONE ELSE. [WHISPERING] Cute. OH, YOUR ROOM IS UPSTAIRS, SIR. FIRST ON THE RIGHT. [DOOR CLOSES] EMMA, CAN I USE YOUR BATH? LAURA'S IN THERE. LAURA, ARE YOU GOING TO BE MUCH LONGER? I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE. I CANNOT BELIEVE TOM IS TAKING SO LONG. DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOR. REAL MEN DON'T WASH. OR CLOTHES SHOP, APPARENTLY. MY MIND'S ON HIGHER THINGS. A PAIR OF CONTACTS AND I'M DONE. THE JOYS OF BEING PERFECT. WELL, I AM THE CHAP OF CHAPS. I ASSUME THAT'S WHY YOU KEEP ME AROUND. NO, I KEEP YOU AROUND FOR COMIC RELIEF. AND JO KEEPS YOU AROUND TO REMIND HER HOW MANLY TOM IS. RIGHT NOW MANLY TOM IS CONDITIONING HIS HAIR IN A LAVENDER-SCENTED BATH WHILE SINGING CHER. OH, MY GOD, I THINK YOU'VE TURNED HIM GAY. YOU COULD ALWAYS BUNK UP WITH ME. IS THAT WHAT IT TAKES TO GET A BATH AROUND HERE? WOULD YOU LET IT GO? I DON'T KNOW HOW TOM PUTS UP WITH THIS ONE. I KNOW. HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND TOM BEEN GOING OUT? HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT ME AND TOM? OH, 3 GLORIOUS YEARS. HAS IT BEEN THAT LONG? HOW HAVE YOU 2 NOT KILLED EACH OTHER YET? UGH. [SCOTTISH ACCENT] YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE STAIRS ARE, DO YOU? OF COURSE I DO. THEY'RE JUST UP HERE ON THE RIGHT. SO, IT'S THIS RIGHT, THEN, THEN ANOTHER RIGHT, THEN A LEFT, AND THEN WE GO DOWN. IF YOU WOULD JUST TAKE YOUR TONGUE OUT OF YOUR CHEEK, YOU'D SEE THAT THEY'RE RIGHT HERE. HMM. I KNEW IT. I'M TELLING YOU, THEY'RE BACK AT THE LAST TURN. HOW WOULD YOU HAVE ANY CLUE? AS IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA YOURSELF. LOOK, TRUST ME. IT'S THIS WAY. COME ON, YOU'LL SEE. LIKE I SAW IN AMSTERDAM? NOW, THAT WASN'T MY FAULT. I WAS ASKING WHERE I COULD GET A BITE TO EAT, NOT WHERE THE NEAREST BROTHEL WAS. SURE, BLAME IT ON STRANGERS. AAH! JEEZ! YOU BASTARD. YOU TWO ARE USELESS. YOU JUST WALKED STRAIGHT PAST ME. COME ON, LET'S GO TO DINNER. THIS WAY. WELL, YOU'RE VERY BRAVE DRIVING ALL THIS WAY BY YOURSELF. BRAVERY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS THE LAND OF MY FOREFATHERS. FREEDOM. PLEASE, LUCY, YOUR ACCENT'S WORSE THAN MEL'S. JEEZ, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT SNOW. I'D HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY STUCK IN IT IF IT HAD COME ON AN HOUR AGO. WELL, I'M GLAD YOU GOT HERE. IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND YOU. I MEAN IT. I WAS, I WAS WORRIED BEFORE THIS HAD ALL, YOU KNOW... FELT LIKE A STEP BACK. BUT JUST SEEING EVERYONE TOGETHER IS JUST REALLY COOL. YEAH. AND HOW ARE YOUR PARENTS? THEY'RE MAD, STILL. BAD? TRUST ME, YOU KNOW, ONE WEEK IN MY HOUSE, AND YOU'D NEVER WANT TO COME BACK TO SCOTLAND. OH, COME ON. NO, GIVE THEM AN HOUR AND THEY-- THEY'D HAVE ME BACK ON THE FARM. NOTHING QUITE LIKE BEING WOKEN UP AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING BY COWS. YOU EVER MILKED A COW? NOT MY IDEA OF A GOOD TIME. BUT YOUR DAD'S SWEET. HE'S SWEET TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE A PRETTY GIRL, AND HE WANTS ME TO MARRY YOU. THAT'S NOT TRUE. HE WANTS ME TO MARRY ANY PRETTY GIRL. LAURA'S A PRETTY GIRL. ISN'T SHE, PETE? LUCY, WE DON'T SEE NEARLY ENOUGH OF EACH OTHER. THE MOST HATED TEACHER... Both: IS MR. G-G-G-ILBERT. DO YOU REMEMBER HIM? HAIRY HANDS AND HALITOSIS. I SWEAR, HE FANCIED ME. WAS IT YOU, PETE? YOU NEVER COULD RESIST HIS PUNGENT, NOT TO SAY HIRSUTE, CHARMS. I CAME TOP OF HIS CLASS IN THAT. WHERE WERE YOU AGAIN? I FORGET. I WAS OUT DISCOVERING GIRLS. AND THEY THOUGHT THEY'D HIDDEN THEMSELVES SO WELL. OH, YOU TWO BOYS HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT SINCE SCHOOL. THE PETE AND DAMIEN DOUBLE ACT. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FANCY DRESS PARTY WHEN YOU GOT THE BIG SHEET AND WENT AS THE 2-HEADED MOTHER TERESA? AND WE WON FIRST PRIZE. I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THAT MAKES IT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A MISTRESS. AND DID THOSE 2 HAVE A LOVE CHILD? YOU ALWAYS COULD RELY ON ANDY TO LOWER THE TONE OF THINGS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU'RE SNOWED IN WITH THOSE 2 FOR 3 WEEKS, YOU WANT A MISTRESS. HOW LONG WILL IT KEEP SNOWING FOR? HALF AN HOUR. FOREVER. SCOTLAND, LAND OF THE BRAVE. VERY COLD. RADIO SAID IT COULD BE HALF A METER OR SO. WELL, I HOPE IT STOPS SOON. DO YOU THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH FOOD TO LAST US? WHY? ARE YOU SCARED? DON'T WORRY, WE ALWAYS GET... HAVE ENOUGH TO LAST FOR WEEKS. WE GET BAD STORMS HERE, IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. BESIDES, IT COULD BE A LOT WORSE. IF WE SURVIVED 6 YEARS AT SAINT NICK'S, ANYTHING ELSE SHOULD BE A BREEZE. HONEY, IT'S NOT THAT, IT'S JUST... FIRST, YOU NEVER BUY ME ANY PRESENTS. AND NOW YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO AWAY WITH ME? HONEY, I DO BUY YOU PRESENTS, YOU JUST NEVER USE THEM. YOU DON'T EVEN USE THIS. IN FACT, IN FACT, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT, THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE IT BACK.I DO USE IT. OK, YOU DO USE IT, YOU DO USE IT. RIGHT. WELL, WHAT WAS THE LAST ADDRESS YOU PUT IN IT? OTHER THAN MINE, WHICH I PUT IN MYSELF. I USE IT FOR THE DIARY. WELL, THEN, IT'S AN 800 QUID DIARY. ACTUALLY, IT ONLY COST 600. HOW DO YOU KNOW? BECAUSE I BOUGHT ONE. THEN I TOOK IT BACK WHEN YOU GOT ME THIS ONE, SEE? WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE ME THE OTHER ONE? IT WASN'T YOUR BIRTHDAY. ANYWAY, IT'S THE ONLY GIFT I'VE EVER GOTTEN OUT OF YOU, AND I'M GOING TO KEEP IT. CHEAPSKATE. THAT'S--THAT'S BULLOCKS. THAT'S BULLOCKS. I GAVE YOU THAT-- THAT THING, THAT BIG-- THAT BIG, EXPENSIVE THING. YOU KNOW, THAT-- THE THING. BESIDES, HOW WOULD I BE ABLE TO CALL YOU FROM EUROPE UNLESS I HAD THIS LITTLE GUY? UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU DON'T WANT ME TO CALL. YOU DON'T KNOW MY NUMBER. YEAH. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, YOU DON'T KNOW MY NUMBER. TOM. NO, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, JUST GIVE ME A DIGIT. JUST GIVE ME ONE DIGIT. ZERO. YOU'RE TERRIBLE. THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU EVER GET OUT OF ME. STUCK IN SOME HUGE MANSION. 3 CARS, MAIDS, AND NANNIES PLAYING MOMMY WITH MONEY. I WOULDN'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY I HAD. I DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK IN THE HOUSE WITH A BABY ALL DAY AND NIGHT. PERSONALLY, I'D RATHER BE MAROONED HERE IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER. WELL, AS LONG AS I HAD A GOOD BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, AND A ROARING FIRE. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT. I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T MIND BEING STUCK IN THIS PLACE FOR A FEW WEEKS. WELL, I WOULD. YEAH, WELL, YOU USED TO GET CLAUSTROPHOBIC IN MISS GRANGER'S MATHS CLASS. YEAH, 'CAUSE A SIXTH FORMER SAID SHE LOCKED THAT GIRL IN THE INSTRUMENT CUPBOARD. WELL, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? NOTHING. OH, SORRY, IT'S JUST AN IRRATIONAL FEAR OF PLACES LIKE THIS. TELL YOU WHAT... NEXT YEAR, COME STAY WITH ME IN BERMUDA. WITH YOU IT'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR. WELL, THEN, TO NEXT YEAR. TO NEXT YEAR. TO NEXT YEAR. ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ AND SO SAY ALL OF US SPEECH, SPEECH. YOU ALL KNOW MY BIRTHDAY ISN'T FOR AT LEAST 3 MORE HOURS, SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE OF ME GIVING A SPEECH. OH, COME ON, IT'S BEEN YOUR BIRTHDAY IN BANGKOK FOR HOURS. WELL, THEN IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND, I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST. FIRSTLY, I'D LIKE TO THANK TIM FOR INVITING US ALL HERE. SINCE SCHOOL WE'VE NOT SPENT NEARLY ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER, SO I'D LIKE TO THANK HIM FOR GETTING US ALL UNDER ONE ROOF. BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT'S HIS 21st BIRTHDAY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TIM. MAY YOU HAVE MANY, MANY MORE. All: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TIM. WELL, AS HOST, IT'S MY DUTY TO RESPOND TO THE TOAST. AND I THINK AT THIS JUNCTURE, IT'S APPROPRIATE TO END AS IT ALL BEGAN, WITH OUR WONDERFUL SCHOOL MOTTO. FACTO MIORUM PERSICUM. All: FACTO MIORUM PERSICUM. I NEVER DID FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT MEANT. "LET US FOLLOW THE EXPLOITS OF OUR ANCESTORS." WHATEVER. COME ON, ARE YOU GOING TO BLOW YOUR CANDLES OUT? YEAH, AND MAKE A WISH. All: YAY! [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] SO, HOW'S THE PHILOSOPHY COURSE GOING? EXISTENTIALIST. YOU MAKE THAT SOUND LIKE AN INSULT. WELL, CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME? YES. OH, PLEASE DON'T. IT'S LIKE THIS. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE DICE ARE UNDER THE CUP? BECAUSE YOU JUST PUT THEM THERE. BUT, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE UNDER THERE NOW? I MEAN, YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE THEM, CAN YOU? NO. I DON'T NEED TO SEE THEM. I KNOW THEY'RE THERE. IT'S LIKE, HOW DO WE KNOW UNDER ALL THAT SNOW THAT THE WORLD'S STILL OUT THERE? MMM, YOU'VE GOT IT THE WRONG WAY AROUND. WE'RE THE DICE. THE QUESTION IS, DOES THE WORLD OUT THERE KNOW WE EXIST? WE COULD JUST... DISAPPEAR. SO ARE THE DICE STILL THERE? OF COURSE THEY ARE. IT'S A LOAD OF WANK. QUICKNESS OF THE HAND. YOU SWINE. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TRUSTED YOU. MY MOTHER WARNED ME ABOUT MEN LIKE YOU. AND WHAT DID SHE SAY? SHE SAID, IF YOU EVER MEET A MAN CALLED PETE MacGREGOR FROM SCOTLAND WHO SMELLS OF WHISKEY, DON'T EVER PLAY BACKGAMMON WITH HIM. WELL, I DON'T SMELL OF WHISKEY. I MEAN, HOW DO I KNOW, PETE? HOW DO I KNOW ANY OF THIS IS REAL? WHAT'S THE MEANING OF LIFE, PETE? YOU STINK, THEREFORE I AM? I TOLD YOU, IF YOU TWO KIDS CAN'T PLAY PROPERLY, I'M TAKING THE GAME AWAY FROM YOU. COME ON, GUYS. THIS, VODKA, WHISKEY, RUM, GIN, SCHNAPPS ISN'T GOING TO DRINK ITSELF, YOU KNOW. JUST PROMISE ME YOU WON'T ALL MAIM EACH OTHER WHILE I'M GONE. ESPECIALLY THE 2 PHILOSOPHERS. [THUD] [HUMMING] [TOILET FLUSHES] JESUS. [THUD] YEAH, HOLD ON A SECOND. [THUD] JESUS CHRIST. I SAID... HELLO? ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS VERY FUNNY. WHO WAS IT? All: WHAT? BANGING ON THE BATHROOM DOOR? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES. NO, I'VE JUST BEEN A FEW MINUTES. WE WERE BEGINNING TO GET WORRIED. NO, NO. I'M FINE. THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRAYING TO THE PORCELAIN GOD, MATE. BABE, WHAT IS IT? IT'S NOTHING. WHAT TIME IS IT, ANYWAY? IT'S LATE. TIM, I'M WELL DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU DIDN'T DO 21 SHOTS. AS THE GRACIOUS HOST, I CAN'T BE THE ONLY PERSON TO GET RATTED, PLASTERED, OR WRECKED. YOU KNOW, I'D JOIN YOU, TIM, BUT I'M EXHAUSTED. NO, STAY. DRINK. DRINK AND STAY. HAVE YOU GOT ANY SCOTCH? DON'T START, TOM, OTHERWISE YOU'RE SLEEPING IN HIS ROOM TONIGHT. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT WASN'T THE PLAN, ANYWAY? MY BED IS ALWAYS OPEN TO YOU, TOM. AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT SHARING A ROOM WITH ANDY. FOR SUCH A LITTLE THING, HE SNORES LOUDER THAN A BLOODY JET. I DO NOT. AND I'M NOT LITTLE. YOU ALL RIGHT THERE, EMMA? EMMA? OH, WHAT? SORRY. YOU OK THERE? YEAH, NO, I'M FINE. I WAS JUST THINKING. ON THAT NOTE, I AM DESPERATELY IN NEED OF MY BED. I'M KNACKERED, TOO. GOOD NIGHT, BIRTHDAY BOY.

[WIND HOWLING] I THINK I MAY LEAVE YOU GUYS. SUDDENLY A BATH SEEMS A LOT MORE APPEALING THAN YOU 2. I NEVER TOOK YOU FOR THE JEALOUS TYPE, JO. TIM, ANY MORE SCOTCH? YOU'VE DRUNK US DRY. NEVER FEAR, PLENTY MORE IN THE LIBRARY. ONLY A COUPLE MORE. OK, BABE. HEY, IS THIS YOURS? SMOKED ABOUT HALF A PACKET OF CIGARETTES. YOU SMOKE NOW? NO, I DON'T. BUT SHE WAS FIT. I WOULD HAVE DASHED MY HEAD OPEN AGAINST A WALL TO GET HER ATTENTION. Pete: IS THAT THE TRICK YOU USED TO PULL, ANDY? THAT'S WHAT MADE ME WANT TO BE A DOCTOR. OH... WHAT HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN? OH, I'VE LEFT MY MOBILE DOWNSTAIRS. DO YOU WANT ME TO GET IT? THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET IT. GOOD NIGHT. NIGHT. DO YOU WANT ME TO GET IT? SHUT UP. HEY, I JUST...LET ME GUESS. YOU FORGOT YOUR PHONE?

WHEN I WENT TO THE BATHROOM, IT SEEMED LIKE I WAS ONLY THERE A FEW MINUTES. AND THERE WAS LIKE THIS-- THIS BANGING, YOU KNOW, LIKE SOMEONE WAS THERE. YOU'RE DRUNK. WE ALL ARE. NOT NEARLY DRUNK ENOUGH. IF YOU CARE TO GET THE BOTTLE... SHIT. I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO ASK. MATE, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. I'LL SORT IT OUT. I PROMISE. DON'T WORRY, IT'S PROBABLY THE GHOST. CAN'T TAKE YOU ANYWHERE WITHOUT YOU DESTROYING EVERYTHING. UH, YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS. WELL, IF IT INVOLVES ME GETTING UP, YOU'LL HAVE TO DESCRIBE IT TO ME. WOW, A BOOK IN A LIBRARY. NEVER SEEN ONE OF THOSE BEFORE. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THAT. I WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED YOU LASTED THIS LONG WITHOUT BREAKING ANYTHING. STILL, THIS IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE "JO'S DRESS RIPPED ASS TO TIT AT LUCY'S PARTY" INCIDENT. SHE DIDN'T FIND IT QUITE AS FUNNY AS I DID. ARE YOU STILL THERE? YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN ANYTHING ELSE HAVE YOU? TOM? TOM? IT'S ABOUT THIS HOUSE. AND A MAN CALLED MURRAY. NEVER HEARD OF HIM. MURRAY WAS THE LORD OF THE AREA. HIS FAMILY HELPED IN THE UPRISING. YOUR FAMILY'S MENTIONED HERE. GREAT. ENGLAND DEFEATED THE REBELLION IN 1745. THEY GAVE THIS HOUSE TO YOUR FAMILY FOR SUPPORTING THE CROWN. WHAT CAN I SAY? NO GOOD DEED IS UNRETURNED. HIS EYES. HMM? THEY CUT OUT HIS EYES. JESUS. THEY CUT OUT HIS EYES AND FED THEM TO HIM. THEY DID SOME PRETTY AWFUL THINGS BACK THEN. THEY ALL DID. ONE NATION PLUNDERS ANOTHER NATION, PLUNDERS ANOTHER. THE BRITISH EMPIRE'S BUILT ON IT. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. I HAVE RETURNED. WHAT? WHAT IS IT? THIS HAD BETTER BE GOOD. I HAVE RETURNED. BLOODY LOON. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

ARE YOU GOING TO GO FOR IT? HE'S JUST A FRIEND. A CUTE FRIEND. THINK OF ALL THE EXISTENTIAL DIALOGUE YOU COULD ENGAGE IN. OH, I COULDN'T. IT WOULD BE TOO WEIRD. ANYWAY, HE'S LUCY'S. THAT WAS A SUMMER FLING YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW, SHE'S DEFINITELY MOVED ON TO ANDY NOW. SOMETIMES I THINK IT'S TIME WE SHOULD START DATING OUTSIDE THE GROUP. [THUD] HELLO? WHO IS IT? [THUD] TOM?

I KNOW IT. CALL THE POLICE. YEAH, THE POLICE. THE SNOW MUST HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THE LINES. SHE WAS MY-- MY BEST FRIEND. THERE'S NO SIGNAL. WELL, WE'VE GOT TO TRY ANOTHER PHONE. SOMEONE MUST HAVE A SIGNAL, THEY WERE WORKING EARLIER. LET'S GO TO BACK TO THE ROOMS AND TRY ALL THE PHONES. EMMA, STAY HERE AND LOOK AFTER TIM. AND--AND LOCK THE DOOR WHEN WE LEAVE. SOMEBODY SHOULD FIND TOM AND MAKE SURE HE'S ALL RIGHT. HE KILLED JO. WE DON'T KNOW THAT. LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT I--I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT TOM WOULD KILL JO. BUT SOMEONE DID. AND THEY MUST STILL BE HERE. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT ARE WE DOING? WELL, TOP PRIORITY, WE FIND A PHONE THAT WORKS. AND I-- I'LL LOOK FOR TOM. Tim: AND DO WHAT? I'LL HELP HIM. OR IF HE IS... WHAT? WHAT? THEN YOU'RE GOING TO KILL HIM? Laura: YOU SHOULDN'T GO ALONE. IT'S TOM. I'LL BE FINE. LET ME COME WITH YOU. OK, YOU TWO SEARCH THIS FLOOR FOR TOM, AND WE'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT UPSTAIRS. AND--AND JUST BE REALLY CAREFUL. LOOK AFTER HIM, AND LOCK THE DOOR WHEN WE LEAVE. ARE YOU OK? I'VE CERTAINLY FELT BETTER. DO YOU NEED ANYTHING? DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR? EMMA, I TOLD YOU TO LOCK THIS DOOR. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES. NOTHING. SHIT, THE BLOODY STORM. LET'S TRY THE OTHER ROOMS. COME ON. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Laura: SHIT. [RINGING] [RINGING] CAN YOU SEE IT? NO. SHIT. LOOK, WE'VE KNOWN TOM SINCE WE WERE 11. I KNOW. I KNOW? SO WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY? TOM'S A GOOD GUY. JUST DROP IT. WHAT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO TIM? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST--WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S IN THE HOUSE, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE TOM'S ALL RIGHT. I KNOW HE CAN BE THE BIGGEST TWAT IN THE WORLD, BUT THIS... I'M REALLY SCARED. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU, I PROMISE. NOTHING. NOPE. IF THE STORM CLEARS... WAIT, WHAT ABOUT THE STAFF? THERE'S 2 OF THEM, RIGHT? THEY MUST HAVE A PHONE. OR A GUN OR SOMETHING. RIGHT. YOU 2 FIND TIM AND ASK WHERE THE STAFF QUARTERS ARE. I'M GOING TO GO CHECK ALL THE OTHER ROOMS AND SEE IF I CAN FIND A PHONE WITH A SIGNAL. HOLD ON, DON'T GO ALONE. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. NO, YOU CAN'T. NONE OF US CAN. AND THERE'S SAFETY IN NUMBERS. THERE'S SAFETY IN NOTHING UNLESS WE FIND A PHONE THAT WORKS. THINK, PETE. WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I SAY, DOES IT? NO. [KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK] WHO IS IT? IT'S DAMIEN AND PETE. OK, THE PHONES ARE OUT. WHAT ABOUT THE STAFF? YES, THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN LINE. THEIR ROOMS ARE THROUGH THE KITCHEN. [KNOCKING] AH, NO, NO, NO. LOOK. [CLOCK TICKING] WHAT? HOW DID YOU... WHAT? HOW DID YOU GET BLOOD ALL OVER YOUR SHIRT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU ONLY CUT YOUR HEAD. HOW DID YOU GET BLOOD ALL OVER YOUR SHIRT? DON'T KNOW. I WAS UNCONSCIOUS. MAYBE I BLED ON IT. YOU. WHAT'S WRONG, EMMA? YOU--YOU KILLED JO. NO, I TOLD YOU, TOM ATTACKED ME.

NO, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. KEEP FOCUSED, KEEP FOCUSED, KEEP FOCUSED, KEEP... TIM? TIM, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? LUCY! STOP HIM. HE KILLED EMMA AND TOM, STOP HIM! SHH. HE COULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE. WHAT--WHAT HAVE WE DONE? WHAT DID WE EVER DO TO HIM? HE INVITES US UP HERE, AND IT'S--IT'S WHAT? TO KILL US. JO...TOM...EMMA. AT SOME POINT WE'VE REALLY PISSED HIM OFF. HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITHOUT THIS. WHATEVER'S HAPPENING COULD HAPPEN TO ANY ONE OF US. WHERE THE HELL IS THE BASTARD? LOOK, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IF WE FIND HIM? JUST WATCH ME. YOU--YOU CAN'T KILL HIM. CAN YOU? WE HAVE TO GET HER HELP. HOW? NONE OF THE PHONES ARE WORKING, AND THE ONLY CAR IS UNDER A METER OF SNOW. I DON'T WANT TO DIE. SHE NEEDS A DOCTOR. YOU ARE A DOCTOR. NOT FOR 2 YEARS. AND EVEN IF I WAS, STAB WOUNDS SNOWED IN, AND PSYCHOS, NOT PART OF THE SYLLABUS. YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK, LUCY. JUST LIE STILL. ONCE THE SNOW LETS UP. IT LOOKS MUCH BETTER. I THINK IT'S STOPPING NOW. IT'S MUCH BETTER. PERHAPS IT WAS THAT SKI TRIP WHEN WE CUT THE BOBBLE OFF HIS BOBBLE HAT. HE WAS REALLY ANGRY. TIM WOULDN'T TURN INTO A PSYCHO KILLER OVER A BOBBLE HAT. THAT WAS YEARS AGO.REALLY ANGRY. OVER A BOBBLE HAT?DESIGNER BOBBLE HAT. OH, SHUT UP. AND THERE'S HIS 18th, REMEMBER? WHEN WE GOT HIM THAT STRIPPER. HE WANTED A STRIPPER. NOT FAT FANNY THE TRANNY GRANNY. OH, YEAH. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I DON'T KNOW WHY, HE'S JUST GONE MAD. THAT'S THAT. I THINK I SHOULD GO AND TRY THE CAR. DON'T BE SO STUPID. YOU'RE STAYING RIGHT HERE. SHE'S GOING TO DIE. DON'T LEAVE ME, ANDY. I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU. NO WAY. YOU'RE COMING WITH ME, WHERE IT'S SAFE. THERE'S ALL THIS BLOOD. ANDY, EVEN IF YOU GET THE CAR STARTED, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO? YOU CAN'T SEE THE ROAD, AND THE NEAREST PLACE ISN'T FOR MILES, EVEN IF YOU DO GO IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I WON'T LET HER DIE. MY FIRST REAL PATIENT. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES OUT THERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'RE SAFE IF WE KNOW WHO WE'RE LETTING IN. WE'RE NOT SAFE AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE. IF WE STAY FOCUSED... YOU CAN'T LOCK THE DOOR FOREVER. ANDY, SHUT UP. IF YOU GO OUT THERE, YOU WILL DIE. HOW CAN YOU KNOW? BECAUSE IT'S FREEZING OUT THERE, AND YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE PAST THE DRIVE. COMMON SENSE, ANDY. YOU'RE STAYING HERE AND LOOKING AFTER LUCY. DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO BACK AND CHECK ON THE OTHERS? WE'LL KNOW IF THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE SCREAM FOR AT LEAST 5 MINUTES. DON'T SAY THAT. COME ON, LET'S GO BACK. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND HIM. I'D RATHER GO OUT AND KEEP LOOKING THAN WAIT FOR HIM TO FIND US. HE KNOWS THIS HOUSE A LOT BETTER THAN WE DO. I STILL THINK WE SHOULD GO ON LOOKING. WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD GO BACK AND CHECK ON THE GIRLS. THEY'LL BE FINE. ANDY CAN LOOK AFTER THEM. PLUS, LAURA CAN LOOK AFTER ANDY ANY DAY. PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, GUYS, LET US IN. IT'S DAMIEN AND PETE. YOU ALL RIGHT? COME ON, LET US IN. GO ON, OPEN IT. NO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NO"? I MEAN, I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM IN. IT'S DAMIEN AND PETE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE IN. FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, THERE'S A MURDERER OUT THERE. AND HE CAN'T GET IN UNLESS WE LET HIM. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR, THEN I WILL. YOU WILL NOT. YOU'LL BE RISKING OUR LIVES. LUCY'S, TOO. IT WAS TIM. WE SAW HIM. NOT PETE, NOT DAMIEN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SAW. THEY'RE NOT THE ONES KILLING EVERYONE. THEY WEREN'T, BUT... [KNOCKING] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. PLEASE DON'T LET THEM IN. I CAN'T LET YOU IN. WELL, WHAT THE HELL?I'M SORRY. OH, YOU'RE SORRY. WELL, THAT'S BRILLIANT! COME ON, LAURA. I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. WHY? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ANDY, LET US IN. LOOK, TIM'S NOT HERE. IT'S JUST ME AND PETE. WE'RE NOT THE ONES GOING AROUND KILLING EVERYBODY! I DON'T KNOW THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT. WHATEVER YOU WERE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON NOW. I'M SORRY, PETE. IT'S THE DICE UNDER THE CUP. I CAN'T RISK OPENING THE DOOR TO FIND OUT. LAURA, COME ON. ANDY, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, LET US IN. WHAT IF IT'S HER? LAURA. I MEAN, SHE COULD HAVE KILLED THEM ALL, LOCKED US OUT. WE SAW TIM. IT COULD BE BOTH OF THEM. WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ANYMORE. IT'S THE DICE UNDER THE CUP. LAURA'S RIGHT. WHAT? LAURA, LET US KNOW THAT ANDY AND LUCY ARE OK, JUST PROVE IT TO US. WE'RE HERE. AND LUCY... HERE. I'M SORRY, PETE. THEY'RE FINE. WE'RE ALL FINE. YOU CAN STAY OUT THERE AS LONG AS YOU WANT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU IN. HOW DO WE KNOW SHE'S NOT MAKING THEM SAY THAT? WE DON'T. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. NOW WHY OR--OR WHO OR HOW OR ANYTHING. SO WE FOCUS ON THE DEFINITES. WE KNOW THAT TIM KILLED TOM, EMMA, AND PROBABLY JO. AND WE KNOW THAT HE'S STILL IN THIS HOUSE SOMEWHERE. RIGHT. SO LET'S GO FIND HIM. AND STANDING HERE THEORIZING IS NOT GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE. WE COULD LOCK OURSELVES IN A ROOM. YOU KNOW, THERE'S OTHER ROOMS. NO. WE'VE GOT THESE, AND THERE'S TWO OF US. I'M NOT GOING TO HOLE MYSELF UP LIKE SOME RABBIT WAITING TO BE PICKED OFF. AS LONG AS I CAN DO SOMETHING, I'M GOING TO DO IT. OK. WELL, LET'S GO AND FIND TIM. TIM. [SIGHS] GET TIM. DAMN RIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THAT LITTLE SHIT GET ME. DIDN'T TIM SAY ABOUT A BOOK? WHY WOULD TIM DO ANYTHING TO US? LET ALONE-- I MEAN, MURDER? HOW FAR GONE DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO MURDER? AND THAT WHOLE THING, PRETENDING TOM HIT HIM, AND IT WAS TIM KILLING EVERYONE. I DON'T THINK IT WAS TIM THEN. WHAT? HIS EYES. COME ON, WE ALL SAW IT. WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL SAY IT? THEY WERE-- THEY WERE BLANK. NOT RIGHT. JUST LIKE TIM SAID TOM'S WERE BEFORE. LOOK. IT STARTS WITH THIS. THIS MAN'S BEEN TORTURED. HIS EYES ARE BEING CUT OUT AND FED TO HIM. SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? TIM SAID, "MURRAY." THAT'S THIS MAN. "I HAVE RETURNED." OH, COME ON.I'M SERIOUS, ANDY. YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS. I DIDN'T. BUT-- BUT THIS FITS FACTS, AND WE'RE STUPID, NOT TO MENTION DEAD, IF WE IGNORE IT. YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS. I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS. WELL, WHETHER WE BELIEVE IN GHOSTS OR NOT IS IRRELEVANT. HE BELIEVES IN US. DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE? LOOK, IT'S NOT FOREVER. EVEN IN SCOTLAND. LOOK, WE JUST GOT TO KEEP GOING. STAY ALIVE LONG ENOUGH TO GET OUT. JESUS. WHAT'S GOING ON NOW? HE MUST'VE PULLED THE FUSE. WHERE DO YOU THINK THE FUSE BOX IS? KITCHEN OR CELLAR, MUST BE. IT'S GOT TO BE IN THE CELLAR. DO YOU THINK IT'S THE STORM? NO. ALL THE LIGHTS WOULD BE OUT. MUST'VE CUT THE FUSE. [WIND HOWLING] DO YOU THINK THAT DID IT? UHH! [MUMBLES] I'M SCARED. SHH. DON'T BE. WE'LL GET OUT OF THIS. [PANTING] PETE, YOU ALL RIGHT? PETE? COME ON. SAY SOMETHING. TIM, YOU SON OF A BITCH! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? I'M SERIOUS. LEAVE US ALONE. [WHISPERING] Damien. PETE? Damien. PETE, IS THAT YOU? WHAT'S IT DOING? MAYBE PETE AND DAMIEN TRIED TO TURN THE FUSE BACK ON. NO. IT'S UP TO SOMETHING. TIM? NO. IT, MURRAY, WHATEVER. DON'T SAY TIM. IT--TIM, WHO CARES. WE'RE STILL GOING-- NO. WE CAN'T EVEN THINK OF IT AS TIM. IF WE--IF WE HAVE TO... IF IT COMES TO KILL US, WE HAVE TO KILL IT FIRST. I CAN'T DO THAT IF I LOOK AT THIS THING AND SEE OUR FRIEND. CAN WE GET HIM BACK? NO, NO. WE'LL SEE. PETE AND DAMIEN WILL GET IT, AND IT COULD TAKE ANY ONE OF US. THEY'LL TURN INTO HIM. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. NO, BUT... I HONESTLY BELIEVE IT. AHH! DAMIEN? DAMIEN, YOU ALL RIGHT? OHH. DAMIEN? AAH! [WHISPERING] Oh, no. Oh, no. THIS IS PETE. LET ME IN. TIM'S DEAD. DID YOU KILL HIM? DAMIEN KILLED HIM. NOW, LET ME IN. LET HIM IN. WHERE IS DAMIEN? LAURA, IT'S OVER. LET ME IN. I'M LETTING HIM IN. NO. NO. WHERE'S DAMIEN? I DON'T KNOW, NOW, COME ON, GUYS. THANK YOU, ANDY. LET ME SEE YOUR EYES. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHERE'S DAMIEN? HOW'S SHE DOING? OK. WHERE'S DAMIEN? I DON'T KNOW. TIM KNOCKED ME OUT, AND WHEN I WOKE UP, TIM WAS DEAD, AND DAMIEN WAS GONE. YOU SHOULD BE PLEASED. IT'S OVER. DAMIEN KILLED HIM. IT'S IN DAMIEN NOW. WHAT IS? LET IT GO, LAURA. IT'S OVER. NO. IT'S JUST STARTING. WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT? TELL HIM, ANDY. WHAT? I DON'T BELIEVE IT. YES, YOU DO. THE SOONER YOU ADMIT IT, THE BETTER CHANCE YOU HAVE OF SURVIVING. LEAP OF FAITH, ANDY. SO HOW'S BEING COMPLETELY MAD WORKING OUT FOR YOU, LAURA? SHE THINKS THAT TOM WAS POSSESSED OR SOMETHING, WHEN TIM KILLED HIM, HE BECAME POSSESSED AS WELL. POSSESSED BY WHO--WHOM? GRAMMAR... IT CAME FROM THE BOOK. TIM TOLD US IT WENT INTO TOM, THE EYES... SEE, THAT'S THE THING-- BLANK. BLANK. BLANK. IT SPREADS. IT COULD BE ANY ONE OF US. WHAT COULD? MURRAY. FROM THE BOOK. LOOK. IT'S HIS VENGEANCE, AND WE CAN'T STOP HIM. WHOEVER KILLS THE HOST, IT GOES INTO. AND NOW, THAT'S DAMIEN. LOOK. BLANK. BUT, BUT... IF DAMIEN KILLED TIM, WHERE IS HE NOW? I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS GONE WHEN I CAME TO. AND NOW HE'LL BE AFTER US. PICKING US OFF ONE BY ONE. IF DAMIEN BECAME POSSESSED, WHY DIDN'T HE KILL PETE? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE-- MAYBE IT TAKES A WHILE TO WORK. I DON'T KNOW. ARE THOSE DAMIEN'S GLASSES? AYE. THEY WERE ON THE FLOOR. DAMIEN'S PRACTICALLY BLIND WITHOUT THESE. HE CAN'T HAVE GOT VERY FAR. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU WERE OUT? PROBABLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES. I DON'T KNOW. WHERE WERE YOU? IN THE CELLAR. LISTEN-- LISTEN, PETE, DO YOU REALLY THINK IF DAMIEN WAS DAMIEN HE COULD'VE JUST CRAWLED OUT OF THERE WITHOUT HIS GLASSES? MMM. NOT YOU, AS WELL. IT MAKES SENSE. IT MAKES NO SENSE. IT MAKES MORE SENSE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S HAPPENED. ANDY, COME ON. I THINK-- I THINK SHE'S RIGHT. ANDY, YOU KNOW DAMIEN. I MEAN, WITHOUT HIS GLASSES, HE COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE HAND IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. SO, IT'S OFFICIAL, THEN? DAMIEN IS NOW POSSESSED, AND IS DETERMINED TO KILL US, AND THERE'S NO WAY OF KILLING HIM, BECAUSE THEN WE WILL BECOME HIM. I KNOW IT'S NOT EXACTLY MEDICAL, BUT IT FITS. IT GETS PASSED ON TO THE NEXT KILLER SO THAT HE CAN FINISH THE JOB. SO, WHAT CAN WE DO? GOD. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT IF WE TRAP HIM SOMEWHERE, AND TIE HIM UP? AND THEN WHAT? WELL, THEN, IT STAYS IN WHOEVER IT'S IN. I'M NOT GOING TO START KILLING MY OLDEST FRIENDS. IF LAURA'S RIGHT, THEN KILLING HIM WILL ONLY CONTINUE IT ALL. HOW DO WE KNOW WE WON'T BECOME POSSESSED IF HE TOUCHES US? WELL, TIM PUSHED YOU ASIDE AND NOTHING HAPPENED. PETE'S RIGHT. IF WE CAN CONTAIN HIM, THEN HE CAN'T GET AT US. YEAH. RIGHT. COOL. SO, HOW THE HELL DO WE DO THAT? SO, WHO'S GOING TO BE THE BAIT? I'LL DO IT. ANDY...NO. YOU SHOULD STAY HERE WITH LUCY. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, YOU'LL BE MORE USE THAN WE WILL. I'LL GO. NO, LAURA, I'LL GO. NO, PETE. STAY HERE WITH THE OTHERS. YOU'RE BETTER OFF IF YOU STICK TOGETHER. AND YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF IF WE'RE TOGETHER. LOOK, ONLY ONE OF US NEEDS TO GO. I DON'T WANT YOU RISKING YOUR LIFE AS WELL. I'M COMING WITH YOU, AND THAT'S FINAL. HE'S RIGHT. IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU 2 STICK TOGETHER. WE'LL BE FINE IN HERE. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS--IS GET SOMETHING TO PROTECT OURSELVES. THE MINUTE WE LEAVE, LOCK THE DOOR BEHIND US. AND DON'T LET US IN IF WE'RE ALONE. WE COULD BE... POSSESSED, AND THE ONLY WAY TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT IS IF WE'RE TOGETHER. GOOD. LET'S GO. BE CAREFUL. I'M READY. IT'S CLEAR. DID YOU CHECK THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THERE AS WELL? [WHISPERING] Hold on. OK. HE'S NOT HERE. ALL RIGHT? I'LL BE WAITING IN HERE. WHEN I YELL "NOW," MAKE SURE YOU GET HERE IN TIME. ARE YOU GOING TO BE OK OUT THERE? I'LL BE FINE. AT LEAST MY ROOM WILL BE LOCKED. YOU SURE HE'LL COME TO US? HE'LL COME AFTER US NO MATTER WHAT. NO UNLOCKED ROOM WILL BE TOO TEMPTING. JUST... PLEASE BE CAREFUL. YOU, TOO. I'M SO THIRSTY. HOLD ON A SEC. I'LL GET YOU SOME WATER. WATER... I KNOW. I'M GETTING IT FOR YOU. [BREATHING SHALLOWLY] NO! NOW, PETE! NOW! LAURA, NOW THE KEY'S GONE. WE'VE GOT TO HOLD HIM. WE CAN'T KEEP THIS GOING. GO GET SOMETHING TO BLOCK THE DOOR. WHERE IS HE? I WANT TO GO HOME. I KNOW. WE ALL WANT TO GO HOME. SOON... YOU'LL BE HOME SOON. NOTHING. DAMN IT!! WHERE IS HE? HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S NOT FOLLOWING US? IF WE BACKTRACK TO THE OTHER END-- NO. LET'S FINISH UP HERE, AND THEN TRY DOWNSTAIRS. HERE. [SCREAMING] WHAT WAS THAT? NOTHING. IT'S FINE. YOU GO AND CHECK ON THEM. I'M NOT LEAVING YOU. IT'S PETE AND LAURA. EXACTLY. BOTH OF THEM. THEY CAN TAKE ON THE WORLD. [DOOR BANGING] HELLO? WHO IS IT? [BANGING] WHO'S THERE? LAURA? PETE, IS THAT YOU? STAY AWAY, DAMIEN! STAY AWAY! [BANGING] JUST IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME. JESUS CHRIST! OH, JESUS. HEY, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. YOU JUST HAD A SHOCK. JESUS CHRIST.YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. JESUS. I CAN'T DO THIS. OF COURSE YOU CAN. YOU'RE A BATTLING SCOT. COME ON. THAT THING SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH. I KNOW. IT SCARED ME, TOO. BUT... EVERYTHING'S FINE NOW. NO, IT'S NOT, LAURA. I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS. LISTEN... WE ARE BEING COUNTED DOWN. DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, BECAUSE IT'S SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. WE'RE GOING TO BE KILLED, PETE! BUT IT WON'T BE ME NEXT. I'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT YOU, BUT... BUT WE'LL LAST LONGER TOGETHER. [STAMMERING] I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WE HAVE TO STOP HIM. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO IF WE FIND HIM. WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. RIGHT NOW, HE'S HUNTING US. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND FIND HIM BEFORE HE FINDS US. I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT. STOP TALKING LIKE THAT! YOU CAN! IT COMES DOWN TO YOUR LIFE OR HIS. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO CHOOSE? PLEASE, PETE, I NEED YOU. LET'S GO. NO. LUCY. [WHISPERING] Hold on. [WHISPERING] Do you think he's out there? I don't know. Do you think it's a trap? Why would he be outside? [HUSHED] MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO ESCAPE. He's not the one in danger. Well, there's one way to find out. YOU READY? No. I'll stay here. If it is a trap, you'll need me to watch your back. He could just lock us out and we'd freeze to death. YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THIS. If we get out of this alive, remind me to update my c.v. OK... OK, I CAN DO THIS. IF I DON'T COME BACK... YOU WILL. OF COURSE. DON'T WORRY. OH, MY GOD. ANDY, ARE YOU STILL... OH, GOD, LUCY. DAMIEN. PETE? PETE? OH... PETE, ARE YOU STILL OUT THERE? NO... [GASPING FOR BREATH] [CRYING AND WHIMPERING] LET ME IN, LET ME IN. IT'S LAURA! PLEASE...I KILLED HIM, I KILLED HIM. PLEASE LET ME IN. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY, LAURA, I CAN'T. [CRYING] PETE, PLEASE, PLEASE LET ME IN. THERE'S STILL TIME. DAMIEN AND LUCY ARE DEAD. PETE, PLEASE. PLEASE, LET ME IN. THERE'S STILL TIME. ANDY'S DYING. I CAN'T. PLEASE, I WANT TO, BUT I CAN'T. I'M SO SCARED. WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN MY SITUATION? PETE. YOU HAVE TO KILL ME, PETE. WHAT? KILL ME BEFORE ANDY DIES, AND THEN THE LINK WILL BE BROKEN. I THINK. I DON'T THINK I CAN KILL MYSELF. NO, I WON'T DO IT. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE. LAURA, ARE YOU STILL THERE? [LAURA SNIFFLES] GOOD-BYE, PETE. NO WAIT, THERE--THERE-- THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S EITHER ME OR BOTH OF US. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. PLEASE THINK IT THROUGH. I'M SO SORRY, PETE. [GASPING RAPIDLY] Pete: IT'S OVER. THE LINK HAS BEEN BROKEN. GONE. ALL MY FRIENDS... GONE. ALL BECAUSE OF THIS. LUCY... DAMIEN... LAURA. LAURA. MURRAY... WHY? WHY DID YOU DO THIS? WHY DID YOU COME BACK? WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU. WE DIDN'T TAKE YOUR LAND, YOUR COUNTRY. MY COUNTRY. I WAS NEVER IN DANGER. THERE WAS NO LINK TO ME. YOU WERE AFTER THEM. YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS TO TAKE ME, SO YOU LET ME LIVE AND TOOK AWAY MY FRIENDS. YOU BASTARD. YOU CHOSE MY LIFE OVER THEIRS BECAUSE OF MY BLOOD. THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THEIR BLOOD. EVERYTHING'S GONE NOW. YOU SPARED MY LIFE TO TAKE THEIRS, AND LEFT ME ALONE. ALL ALONE. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT
