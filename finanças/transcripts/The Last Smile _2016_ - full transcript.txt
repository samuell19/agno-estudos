(Image clicks) (calm instrumental music) - [Kapil] Look, I have been waiting here for the past two hours. - And sir, I just told you we cannot release the records unless we have written from the patient. - How am I to get the written permission? - I'm sorry, it's not only the hospital policy but the state requires it. - I am his father, for heaven sake! - The patient is an adult and the patient privacy applies to all adult patients. - My son is dead. He is dead! (Taps) Don't you understand. How do you suggest I get his permission, huh? - Sir, you don't have to raise your voice. I'm only stating hospital policy. - Is everything okay here? - I'm sorry. - It's all right. - This picture of my son was taken two days before he died. He looked so happy. Something went wrong, terribly wrong. I just want to find out. Please help me. Please. (Pen clacks) - I can't release the records, I'm sorry, but try this number and they'll be able to help you. (Paper rustles) (pensive instrumental music) - Thank you. (Kapil cries) So do you know how old you are today? - Yeah, I'm 17. (Dishes clink) - Yeah, that's pretty grownup. - I know. - It's very grownup. - Baba, what about, can I go? (Muffled speaking) - So you better shape up and make plans and see what you have to do in your life 'cause life is not easy, it's very tough. - Baba, Baba. - Too short. (Water fizzles) - You can't bring homemade food in everyday. The local restaurants depend on us. Tell you what, if you're not hungry, I'll just help myself. (Container pops) (lid clangs) - Ah, curried potatoes. Lentils, my favorite. My thanks to your missus. (Container clacks) Thank you. Lindsay and I went to a Bollywood movie the other day. The heroine reminded me of this Indian girl from my undergrad days. She was something. (Melancholy music) - The house across the same street sold for higher than the listed price. - That shouldn't be a problem. We really like this house. - It is a very good property. - Actually, we're expecting another baby. - Congratulations. It's a very good school district. Quiet neighborhood. Ah, just, thank you. (Letter opener whooshes) (letter opener clacks) (paper rustles) - You need to stop moving. (Man moans) You have a lot of plaque. (Man moans) This is what happens when you miss your appointments. (Hand taps) - Phil, I need your help. - Susan, would you finish him up for me please and set up an appointment for him in six months, and don't miss it or I'll be pulling all your teeth out and trust me, you'll find that a lot more painful. Floss once in a while. I'm glad you came. There's a new restaurant in town, great reviews. - Not this time, Phil. I've got something important. (Paper rustles) - It's addressed to Amit. - Read it. - "Dear Amit, we hope you are enjoying a healthy lifestyle "and continuing to benefit "from our weight loss supplements." I don't get it. Why was he worried about weight loss? Kareeba Health Sciences. - Okay, people, it's time to bring up a man you've been waiting for. The one, the only, the rockstar. Put your hands together and make some noise for Drexel King. (Upbeat instrumental music) (crowd cheers) - How are you guys? Woo! Thank you, thank you, friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. - [Woman] Drexel! - I love you, too. Thank you. This is our 10th successful year of championing healthy living and I couldn't be prouder to announce the launch of our next generation of weight loss product, Kareeba Ultra. (Crowd cheers) - Ultra, ultra, ultra! (Shoes clack) (muffled speaking) (birds chirping) - Dr. Lawrence. (Door clacks) - Yes? - I was waiting to speak with you. - Do I know you? - Not exactly but you knew my son, Amit Raina. You were his GP for many years. I'm his father Kapil Raina. - What can I do for you? - My son was taking these pills. - What are these? - Weight loss supplements. I wanted to find out if they had any effect on his body. I tried to get his health records but, you know. - Yeah, you can go to the medical records department at the clinic. - I did, I did and they sent me (coughs) a whole lot of information, some from when he was 17 and bruised his hand. I just don't know what to make of all this. - I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you. - Well, I was hoping you could check his files and check his blood work in the ER, you know, to see if these pills had any effect on his body. - I can't do that, I'm sorry. - Doctor, you knew my son for many years. You can access his records. - I can but I would lose my job over that. I'm very sorry, excuse me. (Door clicks) (door clacks) (engine roars) (hand taps) (window whirs) - Sorry, may I get a glass of water, please? (Kapil gulps) (glass clangs) - Well, I'm very sorry for your loss. - I've been here since four in the morning. I can't sleep. (Melancholy music) Actually, that's been happening for the last two years, slowly eating away at me. Your daughter? - Yes, she's 14. - Such a pretty girl. I loved my son very much. (Dr. Lawrence sighs) (picture clacks) Don't do it for me, do it for him. Please. (Dr. Lawrence sighs) (paper rustles) - Oh for Christ sake. I don't want your money, just put that away. - Please. - No promises, okay. And no one else can know about this, you understand that, right? - I appreciate it. - Just for the record, I don't like being stalked. (File clacks) (crickets chirp) - Your Mrs. Sharma should get an antenna put in her head so she can have a 24 hour news service. I'm fed up with these people, I tell you. - What were you doing at the hospital? Kapil, your silence is not going to solve any problems. - I went to get his medical records. I'm telling you, Rashmi, there was something wrong in those pills that he was taking. - How long will you go on like this? Just let him go. (Melancholy music) He's happy wherever he is. - We could have saved - But we didn't. Just accept it. - What did you get from worshiping your God for all those hours, huh? - You know what your problem is? - No, tell me. Look, I just want answers. Now can we drop this subject and I can finish eating my khana. - You're looking for answers when you don't even know what the question is. (Pensive instrumental music) (water whooshes) (typewriter clicks) (typewriter whirs) (water whooshes) (typewriter clicks) (typewriter clicks) (train whooshes) (train rattles) (shoes clack) (door creaks) (Rico sighs) (shoes clack) (sneaky instrumental music) (box clacks) - Where were you? (Glasses click) - Where is everyone? - They all quit. Samantha moved to Chicago and Paul said he can't work unpaid anymore and why don't you pick up the phone. - I wasn't home. - Super. We got served with an eviction notice. 30 days to pay the back rent. (Paper rustles) - How about some good news, sweetheart, huh? - (Sighs) We need a case, that's what we need. (Dog barks) - Yeah man, San Francisco, I'm feeling it baby, right? Right, I'm feeling it. No dude, I ain't talking to you, man, chill. Listen, (sighs) put a thousand on the Phillies, too, okay. Yeah, I know, just do it. (Phone beeps) Huh, bring me some luck, huh - Dr. Lawrence. Thank you for meeting with me. - Who the hell's this? - It's a family friend. Phil, this is Dr. Lawrence, Amit's GP. Say hi. - Hello, Dr. Lawrence. - No, no, no, no, it's supposed to be you and me. You're not supposed to tell anyone about this. This is not cool. - Show him a business card or something. - Yes, here, don't worry. I'm only a dentist, see. - Did you find anything? - What? - With the records. - Look. (Ominous instrumental music) The blood work showed hyponatremia, okay. - [Phil] That means low levels of sodium in the blood. - It means dangerously low levels of sodium in the body. It means it could've caused his heart failure. - Amit was very fit. He never missed a day at the gym. - It doesn't matter. Mr. Raina, look, when people exercise, they tend to over hydrate, okay. Too much water, they can flush out the sodium in the body. If that's not replaced, it can cause issues. - That's right, Amit always carried a bottle of water with him everywhere, even at the house. - Okay. - What about the pills? - I don't know, how long was he taking them? - Months, years, I don't know. - Well look, there's no ingredients list on here, okay, so we can't be 100 % sure but drugs like this can cause liver failure, kidney failure. - But these aren't drugs, these are supplements. - The label can say supplement but it should be classified as a drug and there can be adulterants in here. You have no idea what's in them. - How can this happen in this country? What about the FDA? - There are no FDA regulations around them. - I don't understand. - You just told me he's not willing to go on the record. We simply don't know if the supplement used was the definitive cause of death. - His heart failed because of the low so-- - I understand. I'm not a doctor. All I can say is there is not legal remedy here. I'm very sorry, Mr. Raina. I truly am. (Train whirs) - [Kapil] Back in India, we had a big ancestral home in Kashmir, an estate torn down, completely destroyed by the militants. The only thing that survived was an old typewriter my father owned. We were driven out of the valley, our homeland for centuries. Driven out just like that. We made it out of the valley hiding in bakery trucks in the middle of the night. (Melancholy music) Overnight our family, all of my relatives, became refugees in our own country. Still I didn't lose hope. I came to America, the land of dreams, equal opportunity (doors clicks) and justice. I started my business here, made it okay, I guess. But today, today I feel hopeless. - [Phil] Kapil, trust me. Things will get better. - [Kapil] I am tired of running. I am tired of running. Amit should not have died. Someone has to stop this company. - [Phil] There are about 65,000 supplements on the market consumed by more than 50 % of this country. The whole system's broken, not just one company. - The let's start with one. (Coffee splashes) A week after his 23rd birthday, he came home for Thanksgiving. I found him collapsed in the bathroom before dinner. We took him to the ER and the nurse suggested that I go home and get some rest. The next morning, I was directed to a waiting room and I heard, "Code Blue" and I thought, "God, don't let that be my son." - I'm sorry for your loss. - The hospital won't respond to my request for his health records. - This happens all the time. They're afraid of lawsuits. (Dramatic instrumental music) - Contains a proprietary blend from the Kareeba research labs. - They're not obligated to disclose the ingredients on their labels. - Why would they want to make it easy for us? But don't worry, we're gonna find out what this shit is made of. (Bottle clacks) - I want you to find one other person affected by that product in the last two years. - It's difficult, it's not impossible. - I need you to understand that these type of investigations could take several weeks, if not months. - Money is not an issue, if that's what you mean. (Bag crinkles) - $3,000 in advance plus $300 a day plus expenses. (Key clacks) - I bought Amit's condo after his passing. It's exactly as it was, in case you want to have a look at it. (Key taps) - Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna place an ad in leading newspapers and wellness magazines, see if someone will step forward with some information for us, okay. - [Drexel] Three weeks before the merger and this is the kinda shit I have to put up with. - His name is Enrico Fisher. (Paper rustles) Small time private investigator specializing in infidelity cases. - The ad refers to Kareeba Light. - Well find out what he's after 'cause the last thing we need right now is a fucking PR nightmare. All right. (Paper rustles) (paper clacks) (lively instrumental music) - Rico, my friend. It is always good to see you. - Jimmy. (Taps) (muffled singing) (liquid splashes) - So, I give you money then I don't see you for months. - Whoa, whoa, come on, man. Look, I've made some really bad bets and some really bad decisions. And then the fucking stock market goes and crashes again. I mean who could have predicted that, right. Come on, man. - Rico, listen. I give you money. You don't ask how I earn it so I don't ask how you spend it. Once in your hands, it is yours. - Is your hair growing back? I mean it is looking really good. Your wife must really love it, huh. - I'm losing more hair since I started giving money to ungrateful people. - (Chuckles) Can you just (taps) work with me? Look, I'll sign whatever you want, a promissory note, whatever. Just work with me. - Do you know the guys that work for me? $20 a day and a bowl of rice. I spent thousands bringing them into this country. They never sign a contract with me. They can make more money but no, they choose to stay with me. Do you know why? They stay with me because of trust. Do you understand? - I understand. - I trust you, Rico, that you will return my $30,000. ♪ Be to late to walk away ♪ ♪ It might be too late to stay ♪ - I'm going to get you 10 by the end of the month. How about that, huh? - Rico, Rico, I like you but when you make promises you can't keep it makes it very difficult. (Glass clacks) - Jimmy. (Liquid splashes) - [Administrator] Would you like to try a protein shake? - Yeah. (Upbeat instrumental music) - It's on promotion this week. - Hm, it tastes like shit. (Mannequin clacks) - Hey, Rico? - Yeah. - How are you? Doug. Nice to meet you. - Hey man, appreciate you seeing me. Really, really cool place you got going on here, man. - We have some of the greatest trainers and, you know, we really pride ourselves on giving personalized attention to all of our clients. - Nice, nice. So, Amit, he trained here. Is there anything you can tell me aout him? - Yeah, he was a super intense dude. You know, he used to put in a lot of work every time he came to the gym. Really, really nice. It was a shock that he passed away all of a sudden. - Did he have a workout partner? Someone he trained with, you know. - There's this tall dude. Kevin. - Kevin? - Yeah, I haven't seen him for months, to tell you the truth. - All right, if you hear anything at all just, (paper rustles) give me a call, man, all right. - Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't help you out more. (Door clicks) (birds chirp) (door clacks) (car alarm beeps) (traffic whooshes) - Should we go in now? - No, I think we should hang back. It's a little busy here. I don't wanna get made. - All right. - [Aly] It's sad what happened to his son but would you really buy a house just to preserve someone's memory? - If I had the money, why not? - I don't know. Buddhists can be pretty crazy at times. (Statue clacks) - That's Ganesha, (coughs) the elephant face Hindu god. - Buddhists, Hindus, all the same. Believe in reincarnation and Lord knows what. Well, I'm glad we got a case. (Dramatic instrumental music) - Do you ever wonder why he was so specific about the two years? - [Aly] No. - Statute of limitations in California, two years. - Oh, so you think he's going for a lawsuit. Mm-hmm, pays us a few thousand so he can make millions. Well, you are really gonna like this. (Bag crinkles) This particular product was removed two months after it was introduced. - [Rico] Two months. - Introduced in October, removed in December. - It's very interesting. The boy died on Thanksgiving. That means he was taking the product for at least a month. - Which was almost two years ago, so less than month for a chance with a lawsuit. - Good work, Aly. - What are we looking for here? - I haven't the faintest idea. (Bag crinkles) You know what, we're just gonna turn the place over and see what comes up but I would like you to make me some photocopies of this. Take the laptop over there, make a copy of the hard drive. - Should have worked out a clause for litigation. - It's a little late for that now. I'm gonna take off. You just keep looking around and lock up when you leave. Come on, man. You're in a bar, man. I got you a drink. - Not while I'm working. Hey, you should come by the house this weekend. Jessica's been asking after you. - Jimmy, a large cranberry juice. Our boy here has a bladder infection. (Kirk chuckles) (ice clinks) (bag crinkles) I need you to tell me what that's made of. - And this is? - Weight loss pills. Part of an investigation I'm doing. - Why don't you take it to the manufacturer? - Can't. (Glass thuds) - I mean I can, you know, run some tests on it see if there's certain chemicals but if you want the full formulation, you gotta take it to the manufacturer. - I really need you to see if there's something in there that there shouldn't be. - All right, well, I mean how soon do you need it? - Yesterday but I can wait a week. (Bag crinkles) (ice clinks) (sneaky instrumental music) (camera beeps) (camera beeps) (camera beeps) - No, I can definitely meet him there. Do you have an address for me? (Pen clicks) Okay. (Pen clacks) One sec. (Moans) Go ahead, please. (Pencil clacks) Okay, thank you. (Phone clicks) (pencil whooshes) (shoes clack) - I have news for you. - Well, make my day, Aly. - Drexel King is banging Kaitlin Conners. - And who's she? - Their new CFO. He brings her in a month after the previous CFO dies in a car accident. They both are married, just not to each other. You wanna take a look? - No, no, just put it on the invoice. - I already did under the entry company investigation. Look here, look. They always go to the same hotel, same time in the afternoon. Tuesdays and Thursdays. - It's interesting. - By the way, Drexel King sees a whole lot of execs from Cromwell Griffin. - Did you get any inside shots? (Chair creaks) - No, should I? (Shoes clack) Yeah, I should. (Camera clacks) (Aly sighs) (chair whooshes) (Aly moans) (cards clack) (triumphant instrumental music) (crowd cheers) - [Rico] I found this in Amit's condo. It says that he was a certified nutritionist. - But his major was business economics. DK Institute of Nutrition. - DK, Drexel King. The institute trains Kareeba distributors into becoming certified nutritionists. - What does that mean? - It means that Amit was not only using the product, he was selling it for the company. How well did you know Amit? I mean, his friends and the people he hung with. - He moved out when he was 18 and my wife wasn't happy that he was living in another apartment in the same city. We hardly knew any of his friends. - Did he ever mention the name Kevin Williams? - I don't remember. (Dishes clink) - Do you mind if I ask you something? - Sure. - Why are you doing this investigation? - Does it matter? - Maybe not but I still really wanna know. (Dishes clink) (muffled speaking) - I couldn't save Amit, maybe I can save someone else. - Well, saving the life of one person isn't going to change the world, Mr. Raina. - But for that person the world changes. - I got it. - Oh, before I forget. - Make it out to Fisher and associates. Oh, and the ad cost an additional $5,000. - Yes, of course. When can we meet again? - As soon as I have an update, I'll give you a call. (Camera clicks) - All right, now, now squeeze your abs real hard. Nice, nice. (Camera clicks) - Some good looking girls. - Yeah. - Michael Talley? - Yes. - I'm Rico Fisher. (Muffled speaking) I called your house, I spoke to your mom on the phone. She told me I could find you here. - Nice. (Camera clicks) - Just wanted to ask you a few questions about your friend Amit. You guys were in the same Kareeba network, right? - Yeah but I don't do that anymore. - Why not? - Arch the belly. - They make you buy $300 worth of product every month just to be eligible to collect points. (Camera clicks) After a while, I couldn't afford it. - Damn. - I think I still have some boxes laying around my parents garage. (Camera clicks) (dramatic instrumental music) - You know, tell me something. Do you remember buying this product here, Kareeba Light? - No, I never used those. I used to get multivitamins and energy drinks. If you wanna lose weight, just hit the gym and eat healthy. Those pills ain't worth it. - Well, what about this product that you're modeling for right now? - Never used it. - Are you a go-getter? - [Audience] Yes. - Would you like to have financial freedom and break free? - Yes. - Well, who's stopping you from becoming rich? - Nobody. - Nobody is stopping you. You control your own destiny, my friend. That is the mantra. (Audience claps) - First time? - Yeah. - Well, welcome. I'm Laura Williams and you have made a good decision. What's your name? - (Smacks) Rico. - Rico. (Pen clacks) Well, here you go, Rico. (Tag whooshes) And there's a form for you-- - You cannot become rich on a single source of income. What you need is (paper rustles) residual income. There are thousands of companies-- - She's quite a go-getter, huh? - Oh yeah, Holly's terrific. - But at Kareeba health sciences, you get a family. (Audience claps) - She's a platinum level member and one of the most successful here at Kareeba. (Audience cheers) - [Kapil] Amit, can you get down from the tree? - No, no. No, no, it's fun. - [Kapil] You wanna stay there? - Yeah. - [Kapil] How does it feel? (Muffled speaking) Chintu, how does it feel? - Fine. (Muffled speaking) No, I'm letting him. No. (Man speaks in a foreign language) I'll get down, I'll get down. I'll get down. (Door bell dings) (shoes creak) (door creaks) - Hi. - Yes? - Sir, my name is Nicholas. I'm participating in a school program that helps with rehabilitation of teenagers affected by substance abuse. We're selling cookies today to raise funds. Would you like to donate for the cause? - How much are they? - [Nicholas] $8, sir. - I'll take two. (Box thuds) (money rustles) - I don't have any change with me. - I don't have any smaller bills. What do we do? (Chuckles) (speaks in a foreign language) So I had to buy the whole box. (Melancholy instrumental music) - $3,000, $5,000 and another 5,000 this week. Nay, it's not about the money. - Then what is it about? Ask me straight. - Okay, tell me what is going on. Kapil. - I just want to know what happened to my son, that's all. That's all. - Then why don't you tell me anything? I am your wife. - Oh don't start that again, Rashmi, please. - I feel so alone. I just deal with it in my own way. (Door clicks) - Wonderful, thank you. (Box clacks) (hands clap) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Amit ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (Rico moans) (picture clacks) - [Rico] Wanna stick of gum? - Mikey, don't be shy. Say thank you. (Coffee splashes) (pot clacks) Here you go. - Ah yeah, thanks. - Can't you stay for breakfast? - No, I really should get going. So how long have you been doing this Kareeba thing? - Just over a year now. Kevin's life insurance ran out quickly so I had to do something after I lost my job. - What happened to him, if you don't mind me asking? - [Laura] They say he had a stroke. Mikey and he were returning from a ballgame and they stopped for gas and that's when it happened. He wasn't moving when the paramedics arrived. (Sighs) - I'm sorry. (Sneaky instrumental music) - Yeah, he was a good man and a great father. (Chuckles) And he was working as a distributor so I inherited the downline. - How's that working out for ya? - I'm still expanding my network. Holly says it can take up to two years to become profitable. It's really all about residual income after that, you know. - Well, good luck with that, you know. (Glasses click) - Maybe we can work as a team then we could benefit from each other's network. - You know, why don't you let me think about that, all right. - You never told me what do you do. (Floor creaks) - You mean for a living? Sort of self-employed. Haven't really figured it out yet. - Well, Holly says the difference between self-employed and entrepreneur is simply a matter of having a vision. You sure I can't make you anything. I could whip you up some eggs. - No, I really do gotta get going. I gotta meet somebody so just next time. - Well here, don't forget your coffee. (Cup clangs) (door creaks) (pensive instrumental music) - Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts that we are about to receive. - Bless this food to our use and us to your service. - Lord, make us grateful for all your mercies and mindful of the needs of others, amen. - Amen. - Amen. (Dishes clink) - So Rico, what are you up to these days? (Dish thuds) - Not much, just working on a new case. - Aly tells me you got a big one. Might be important. - Don't exaggerate. All I said was case had some potential. - Hand me your plate. (Plate clacks) They're starting a new factory on the east side. I still got my connections with the union. I could submit your name, if you want. - Yeah, I appreciate that, Bob. - You know, retirement's not far away. It's just around the bend. It's quick as a bullet. Sometimes you'll sit in bed and wake up and realize how fast everything is gone. (Spoon clacks) You need to start saving for your future and that means getting a job. - He has a job and he doesn't need your advice. (Spoon clacks) - He can't keep running around chasing them dickheads and them weird mistresses for the rest of his life. - Can we talk about something nice for a change? (Spoon clacks) - [Bob] All I'm saying is he needs to find himself a nice girl and start a family. If not, he'll end up like his father. - [Aly] Let him figure it out. It's his life. (Dramatic instrumental music) (car whooshes) - Rico, my good friend. (Shoes clack) What did you brought for me today? - Well, I have me a new client. I'm seeing some positive cash flow. - Good, very good. - What is that? - Chinese health balls. They help me with strength and endurance, if you know what I mean. (Paper rustles) - It's five grand. (Paper rustles) - Five. - Well, I had to spend some on office rent. - You promised 10. - You're gonna get your money, okay. It's not like I'm running away. - How do I know? - Because I got myself this rich client now. I'm talking loaded rich and you gotta be patient when you're milking that cash cow, my friend. - When it comes to money, no friend, no enemy, just business. - Yeah but there's a Chinese saying that says money doesn't make you rich, it only makes you wealthy. - There is another Chinese saying, "Don't listen to Chinese saying from someone "who owes you money." - Just need a little more time is all. - You had more than a year. There's no more time to give. - Just listen to me. - No, you listen to me. I am trough fucking with you, Rico. I am under a lot of pressure. - What are you talking about? - Where do you think I get that kind of money, huh? I take it from them, I add a few points and then I give it to people I know. - Who's them? - They are the kind you don't mess around with. These guys eat dogs where they come from. You think they'll think twice to spare a son of a bitch like you. - Look, I just don't have the money. I don't know how else you want me to put it. (Lighter clicks) - Then you better find it in a treasure map because if you don't pay by the end of the week, you better run. (Bell rings) (door bang) (horses clop) (calm instrumental music) - Tell me what's the co-founder of Cromwell Griffin doing sending a two-bit private dick cryptic text messages? - How much do you know about Kareeba Health Sciences? (Sneaky instrumental music) - Well, I know that they sell products too good to be true, marketed by naive individuals who feel that they're going to become the next big thing. - I like your honey opinion, Mr. Fisher, but it's not true. And they do pride themselves in their millionaires club. - A dozen millionaires in a network of thousands. It's an exaggerated dream you're selling. I guarantee you less than 1 % turn a profit. - I was a scientist for a major drug research company for many years before I founded Cromwell Griffin. The market downturn affected us even though our products were the best out there. But the network marketing companies continued to turn profits even in the slowdown. - Is that why you're merging with Kareeba? Why was Kareeba Light discontinued after two months? - Mr. Fisher, one can easily start a fire. Putting it out is a different matter. If you find something, you come to me. I'd like to fix the problem. - I'm not sure that I follow you. - I was hoping that we could come to some kind of mutually beneficial agreement that wouldn't compromise the company's position. (Glass clinks) Think about it. - So you think the diet pills had something to do with it. - Untimely death, fit young man, I mean it's a definite possibility. You know, I have a lawyer friend who specializes in such cases. - Is he good? - Oh absolutely. I mean, he's got years of experience. - Well 'cause good lawyers cost money, like a lot of money and that's something I don't have. - No see, you don't have to put anything down up front. Now, if they win the case, they just take their fees out of that. (Muffled speaking) I could arrange a meeting for you. - I don't know. I mean, do you really think I have a chance? - Trust me. (Phone beeps) - Hey, it's Kirk. Ah listen, I ran that sample that you gave me and there's trace amounts of sibutramine in it. It's an appetite suppressant. Increases heart rate, blood pressure so-- (door clacks) Wait, just a sec. Hello, hi, are you looking for someone? - We're looking for you, doc. - How did you get in here? (Dramatic instrumental music) - It wasn't hard. Might wanna lock your door. Say doc, you look like a smart guy, can I ask you a question? Who was it that said, "For every action, there's an equal "and opposite reaction"? - Newton. - Thanks doc, you just made me five bucks richer. - Listen, I don't know who you are but I'm calling security. - I wouldn't do that. - No, you can't-- That's confidential. Who are you? - We are the reaction to your action. (Liquid splashes) (Kirk chokes) (typewriter clicks) (melancholy music) (birds chirp) - My son used to play tight end for his school team. He was a good athlete. One game, my wife and I were sitting here and he got hit. I told her it was a mild concussion and not to worry, but when we got home, I was worried. I kept checking on him every couple of hours. When he slept, he used to have this faint smile on his face and when I saw the smile, I knew everything was fine. My mother called him the smiling angel. That night he collapsed, the paramedics were taking him out to the ambulance, he had that same smile on his face. - What does Amit mean? - Infinite, the eternal friend of everyone. In the second grade, he once asked me what infinity meant. I couldn't explain it to him. They say the air molecules that we exhale hover in the air for years. When I come here, I can still feel his presence. - Well, I have some good news for you. (Muffled speaking) I found Kevin Williams. (Balls clack) - [Assistant] He had to be silenced. - I don't particularly approve your style of conflict resolution. - It was a split second decision. - You hired these clowns. They're supposed to be professionals, right. What the fuck is a matter with you? (Balls clack) - They made it look natural. No one's gonna get in trouble. - Jesus fucking Christ. (Balls clack) - What the fuck you want me to do? One moment you ask me to take care of it, no matter what it takes and now, you want me to guilt trip for you. - Gentlemen, we must not quarrel amongst ourselves. - I just don't want any complications during the merger, that's all. (Balls clack) - Stop worrying, it's just a kid. (Machine beeps) (paper rustles) (machine beeps) (dramatic instrumental music) (machine beeps) (paper rustles) (fingers tap) (hand knocks) (door creaks) (shoes clack) (door clacks) - I was waiting for you. - I had errands to run. - Errands? Are you kidding me? All you had to do was just come down and sign the damn papers. This could change your life, Laura. Look, you're not gonna make it selling those stupid shampoos and vitamins. Are you listening to me? This is your passport to freedom. Take it. - My life has been changed upside down thanks to you. - What's that supposed to mean? - I don't wanna see you anymore. - They got to you, didn't they? Well, how much did they offer, huh? A million? Answer me. - (Slaps) Get out! - And here I thought you were different. - Out. - I honestly thought you would do the right thing. - What makes you so righteous? You never told me that you were investigating a case or that you knew about Kevin before you lied your way into my life. And now you have the audacity to lecture me about the right thing. How dare you? - Okay, I'm sorry, I should have told you. (Laura cries) Did they threaten you? Why are you afraid? Tell me. - Just leave. - I can protect you, you and Mikey. Just come with me, Laura. - You are so naive. You've no idea who you're up against. (Hand bangs) (door clacks) (Laura cries) - Bingo. - Yeah. (Birds chirp) (phone rings) - Yeah. (Car whooshes) He's still at it. (Cheerful instrumental music) - Come on, time to go home now. Come on, get up. Up, up. Good, good boy. Come on, get up, get up. I got you, I got you, I got you. Walk right this way, just yeah. (Dart clacks) - What the hell is going on? - Rico Fisher? - Yeah, what's happening here? - Let him in. (Sneaky instrumental music) (shoes clack) I'm Inspector Gallaway, SFPD. This is Special Agent Torrey from the DEA. (Dart clacks) - Fuck. - Anonymous caller reported a break in. By the time the responding officers arrived, it was already like this. You know why someone would wanna break into your office? - I have no idea. (Sniffs) Wait, why is the DEA here? - You tell us. - What's that supposed to mean? (Draw whooshes) - Cocaine, about a kilo. - That shit ain't mine. (Door clicks) - Craig, where the hell have you been? Can you tell this guy that somebody planted that cocaine? - Do you realize how much trouble you're in? - Listen Einstein, you're not gonna find a single print on it. They killed Kirk and now they're trying to set me up. - Listen, Rico, I read the police report. There was no signs of a struggle. Kirk was drunk, he tripped and he fell down the stairs. - And you believe that. - The FBI needs more than a hunch to initiate an investigation. - It's not just a hunch. Here, look at this, okay. (Paper rustles) It shows here that Kirk placed a two-minute call to my apartment the same evening that he died. Two minutes. And yet there's not message (hand taps) on my machine. - So what? - Isn't it obvious? They came to my apartment and they erased it. We're dealing with professionals here. - And you're telling us this has to do with weight loss pills which are no longer available on the market. - Yes, Kirk was trying to analyze it for me. - Rico, this is a major corporation you're talking about. They don't just go around killing people. - Yes, they do. - Oh, come on. We've got a simpler system in this country. If you don't like somebody, sue them. - I had a client that was gonna sue the damn company. It's the only lead that I was betting on and they got to her, too. - Listen Rico, FBI staffing's down 30 % from last year. Budget cuts are killing us. What I'm trying to tell you is I need more than a phone bill if I'm gonna go after these guys. - And what if I told you that the chairman of Cromwell Griffin offered me money to drop the investigation. - So now Cromwell Griffin's involved in this, too. - Come on, Rico, I know you're pretty stressed out but you gotta drop this bullshit. - You try telling that to the father who lost his son to those goddamn diet pills. Am I free to go? - For now. (Paper clacks) (jacket rustles) (door clicks) (door clacks) (sirens wail) (dramatic instrumental music) (door clicks) (shoes clack) (shoes clack) (bottle clacks) (Rico coughs) (man taps) - (spits) You fuckers kill me you're not gonna get any of the money. (Men speaking in a foreign language) What are these fucking putos saying, man? - He wants to beat you but he also wants to beat you so I'm dividing the work between the two guys. So they could take turns. (Rico moans) (door clicks) - "Fear not, fear not for behold I tell you good tidings "of great joy which shall be to all people, "for unto you is born this day a savior, "which is Christ the Lord." (Melancholy instrumental music) - (gasps) Thank you for coming over. - How did they get inside? - I don't know. They probably bribed the apartment manager and got the key. (Moans) - Do you have any other place to stay? - No, I have no other place to go. - What if they come back? - I don't think they'll be back for a few days. - Look, why don't you stay at Amit's condo you know, till you just get another place? - No, no, I can't. - Look, I feel bad enough as it is for putting you into this for the first place. - I never told you who these guys were or why they came after me but it has nothing to do with our case. I'm sorry I couldn't do more. - Don't worry about it. It was a battle we could not have won. Even if we had succeeded with Kareeba, that's just one company. It's a whole system we must change. (Shoes clack) - You're laughing. (Sticks click) (melancholy instrumental music) (door clicks) - You've taken very good care of her, I can tell. Another initial there and a signature at the bottom. (Pen scratches) I work here and I know it's none of my business but you do realize you could have gotten a lot more for her through private sale. I recently got myself a Mercedes. It was a very good deal but had I known you were looking to sell yours. Hm, anyway, I'm sure you have a very good reason for getting rid of her. (Car whooshes) (hand taps) - [Mr. Yu] Okay, okay. (Door clicks) (sneaky instrumental music) - It's all there. Principle and interest. (Envelop rustles) Where's the trust? - Rico, sorry things didn't work out. (Door clacks) - Some 260,000 Americans lost their job in December and that brings (water splashes) the total to over two million jobs lost this year. And many who do have jobs, no longer have 401k matches. Christopher Boyd is live in San Francisco and Chris, many are turning to network marketing for help. - Yes, Karen, for some it's a second source of income but for others in these rough economic times, it's becoming a first source of income. And as you said, it's called network marketing or multi-level marketing and it's a way for some people to stay afloat in the rough economic seas. (Dramatic instrumental music) While her husband was looking for a full-time job, Kathy Talley decided to make a little money on the side. Since October, Kathy's been selling products for Kareeba Health Science. The company relies-- - The market downturn affected us even though our products - On a network (mumbles). - [Dr. Griffin] Were the best out there but the network marketing-- - Recruit other people to sell their products. - Companies kept turning profits even in the slowdown. - They make you buy $300 worth of product every month just to be eligible to collect points. After a while, I couldn't keep up the pace. - Holly says it can take up to two years to become profitable. After that, it's really all about residual income. - Mr. Fisher, one can easily start a fire. Putting it out is a different matter. (Ship horn blows) (door clicks) - Brought you some noodle soup. - (Groans) Thank you. - What happened to your hand? - Nothing. - Ugh, and your face. - Bar fight. (Lid clacks) - I get the feeling you are not telling me the truth. - (Slurps) Mm, wow that's really good. Where'd you get this from? - Yu's restaurant. He was asking about your finger. How did he know about your bar fight? - (Sighs) I figured it out, Aly. - Figured what out? - The whole thing. (Dramatic instrumental music) - So? - [Rico] SUppose somebody goes into the ER with a gunshot wound to the chest and a broken arm. The doctors are gonna treat the gunshot wound and not the broken arm. - [Aly] You had a gunshot wound. - No, Kareeba did and we've been looking at their broken arm. - You're not making much sense, kiddo. - Okay, what's the first thing that we did when we got the case? - [Aly] We put out an ad. - [Rico] Right, and it sent a shockwave through the company. They go and have me followed. Kirk gets into an accident. They go and threaten Laura. But why would they go through so much trouble? - [Aly] My guess is they didn't want to get sued. - [Rico] What's the big deal? This is America, everybody gets sued. No, no, no, no, they were afraid of something else. - [Aly] Afraid of what? - [Rico] The timing of the investigation. (Elevator bell dings) Even a small distraction, like a lawsuit could put the merger in jeopardy. - [Aly] Merger with Cromwell Griffin. - Mm-hmm, here's my theory. What if Kareeba was actually running a giant pyramid scheme, a scheme where people get paid commission based off of the recruitment and not the product sales. - What you think it's a Ponzi scheme? - And what if it is? Just humor me for a second. - But Ponzi schemes collapse at some point, don't they? - Yes, but if you replace the Kareeba products with good ones that people genuinely like, like the ones from Cromwell Griffin, for instance. - You've got yourself a winner. That explains the merger. - Yes. It's a perfect marriage except now, you have to alter the books, hence here comes Kaitlin, the new CFO just before the merger. - [Aly] Oh, that chick is something else. Ugh, you should see the video. She can get really kinky. - What video? - You asked me to get them on tape, remember. - I did. - Let me tell you something, (elevator bell dings) these perverts really have it going on. (Shoes clack) (door clicks) (shoes clack) (coins clink) (phone clicks) (phone beeps) (phone rings) (phone clicks) - Hello. - May I speak to Kaitlin Conners, please? - [Kid] May I ask who's calling? - Tell her that it's Rico Fisher. (Phone clacks) - Mom, you have a call from Rico Fisher. (Computer clicks) (shoes clack) - Sweetie, can you go watch TV? (Shoes clack) This is Kaitlin. - Merry Christmas. - [Kaitlin] Do I know you? - We both know that you know me so let's cut through the introductions and get straight to business. I have with me some very important material. I had no idea you were so flexible. - [Husband] Who is it, honey? - Just work related, I'll be right there. I can't talk right now. - Yes, I understand. That's why you're going to meet me at Jimmy's Bar corner of Ninth and Market, tomorrow at five. (Phone clinks) (phone buzzes) (phone clicks) Looks like you could use a drink. (Paper rustles) Vodka martini? - How much do you want? - Just a few answers. I ask some questions and you answer them. Simple and easy. - What if I walk out of here right now and you watch. - Well then, Mr. Conners is going to get something from our video department, every angle, inside and out. Quality work. (Lighter snaps) - Can you guarantee you won't continue to harass me? - How does a woman with a loving husband, family, wealth, everything, still wind up on the cheating side? (Kaitlin and Rico laugh) - That's your question, my private life and who I sleep with. - That's not what I meant. You're the CFO of a major corporation, a publicly traded company. I'm giving you a chance to come clean. - And I don't know what you're talking about. (Phone rings) - Drexel King. (Phone clicks) (phone clicks) (phone clicks) (phone rings) (phone clicks) - [Drexel] Why did you call me? - [Rico] I wanted to tell you that I just confirmed a hunch. - Okay, and that is? - [Rico] Why you guys considered me to be such a big pain in the ass. - You've got my attention. - [Rico] You were afraid that I might eventually get a whiff of that accounting scandal brewing at your place. - And how, may I ask, did you confirm that hunch? - [Rico] Oh, that part was relatively simple. I just broke into your office and stole the evidence. - Why should I believe you? - [Rico] You're right, you shouldn't believe me. What I think you might wanna do is check it out for yourself and when you do, see if I smiled really big for the security cameras in your office. - [Drexel] What do you want? - That's the million dollar question now, isn't it? What do I want? I don't know. What would you do if you had such valuable evidence in your possession? - I don't wanna do this over the phone. - You're a smart guy, you know that. That's why you're going to meet me at Don Giovanni's at six o'clock. I'm gonna buy you some dinner, Mr. King. (Drexel slurps) (spoon clings) Where's the trust, huh? I told you I wasn't wearing a wire. (Lid pops) - Is this it? - Yep. (USB stick plops) I have a copy. - I forgot to check his shoe. - This is for a locker. - All right, (sighs) what's your price? - Wired from your personal account (plate whooshes) to an offshore account. The account number's on the back. (Plater clacks) - And I should trust you because? - 'Cause you don't have a fucking choice. - Just curious about the figure. Why not go for a million? - Oh, that's because I don't have the 80 bucks on me to buy you dinner. Don't forget to tip your waiter. (Drexel sighs) - You're the CFO of a major corporation, a publicly traded company. I'm giving you a chance to come clean. - And I don't know what you're talking about. - Mr. Jacob Meyer, your predecessor, died of a car accident two months ago. Autopsy showed that he had high levels of alcohol in his system. - So? - He was a practicing Mormon. These men that you're working for have blood on their hands. - You think you can bring me here, show me these underexposed pictures and expect me to corroborate some fabricated stories about an accounting scandal and a murder conspiracy. Fuck you. (Kaitlin and Rico laugh) - Ah, I never said anything about an accounting scandal, Mrs. Conners. Oops. You see, the pictures are the last thing that you should worry about. I'm talking about possible legal immunity for you. In a couple of minutes, some men are going to be walking in through that door over there. If I were you, I'd cooperate with them. (CD clacks) That has all your photos and video files. I made no other copies. I know you're going to do the right thing. (Shoes clack) - Kaitlin Conners, I'm Craig Moose with the FBI. This is Dave Knowle from the federal prosecutor's office. We'd like you to come with us for questioning. (Crickets chirp) (sneaky instrumental music) - How'd it go? - Well, I stole a $10 memory stick for a million bucks. - Not bad. - Not bad. - (Chuckles) What if he had called your bluff? - And what if he did? - (Sighs) A million dollars. Wow. What are we gonna do with it? - Just a day before the merger with Cromwell Griffins, Kareeba Health Sciences, a San Francisco based network marketing company, is now under criminal investigation by the SEC for accounting fraud. Authorities say a tip-off from an insider led to a joint investigation by the FBI, FTC, and SEC. The company declined to comment on the ongoing investigation and its stock fell sharply in after-hours trading. And in sports, San Francisco is back in the playoffs-- (calm instrumental music)
