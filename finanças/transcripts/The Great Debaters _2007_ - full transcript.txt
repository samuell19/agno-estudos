Come get this whupping, boy. - Get him down, Trudell. - Scared, ain't ya? Huh? You with the razor and twice my size? They must defeat them. They must do what they have to do in order to do what they want to do. Come on, now. Come on, baby. Education is the only way out. Come on, baby. Get up. Get up, baby. Come on. The way out of ignorance... Like cutting people, huh, boy? Want to cut people, Trudell, huh? Get your hands off me. The way out of darkness. Into... the glorious light. Come on, now.

"Hating you shall be a game played with cool hands." "Memory will lay its hands upon your breast, and you will understand my hatred." Gwendolyn Bennett wrote that. She was born in 1902. Unofficially. You see, in most states, Negroes were denied birth certificates, which means I can lie about my age the rest of my life. You think that's funny? To be born... without record. Mr Reed, hand these out. I'm going to introduce you to some new voices this semester. There's a revolution going on. In the North. In Harlem. They're changing the way Negroes in America think. I'm talking about poets like Hughes, Bennett, Zora Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen... "Some are teethed on a silver spoon, "with the stars strung up for a rattle. "I cut my teeth as a black raccoon... for implements of battle." Meet me after class. What's a professor doing in the middle of the night dressed like a cotton-chopper? What is a student doing in the middle of the night throwing his life away? It's funny. I thought I was defending myself. Mm. I remember you. Couple of years ago. Then you disappeared. What happened? I come and go whenever it suits me. - Suspensions? - Leaves of absence. Why'd you come back? School's the only place you can read all day. Except prison. I want you to come by my house tonight, 7:30. - Corner of June and Campus. - Why would I do that? Holding try-outs for the debate team. You sure you want somebody like me? No. That's why you're trying out. 7:30. June and Campus. "Driven by the wind and tossed..." Do well tonight, Junior. Of the 360 students here at Wiley College, only 45 of you were brave enough to try out for the debate team. Of that 45, only four of you will remain standing when the try-outs are over... why? Because debate is blood sport. It's combat. But your weapons are words. Come on in. Now that Mr Farmer has joined us, we can begin. Sit down, Mr Farmer. Not right there. Over there. - Yes, sir. - James. Right this way. Good evening, Mrs Tolson. - Evening. - Excuse me. We're waiting for you, Mr Farmer. I'm going, sir. Thank you, Mr Farmer. You smell very good, Mr Farmer. - Thank you, sir. - You're very welcome. Gentlemen and lady. This is... the hot spot. You will enter it at your own risk. Mr Tolson, what about the debaters from last year? Don't ask a question you already know the answer to. Get up here. You'll be first. Get right here. Hot spot. Debate starts with a proposition. With an idea..."Resolved: Child labour should be regulated by the federal government." The first debater argues the affirmative. Affirmative means that you are for something. Mr Reed will argue the affirmative. The second debater argues the negative. Negative means that you are what? Against. Brilliant, Mr Burgess. You shall argue the affirmative, Mr Reed. Go. Well, sir, I'd begin with a quote from the poet Cleghorn. "The golf links lie so near the mill, "that almost every day, "the labouring children can look out and... and..." ♪ And watch the men at play ♪ Is that what you learnt from last year, Mr Reed? To start something, and not finish it? - Is it? - No, sir. Sit down. Who's next? You? Stand up. Stand up. It's getting late. How much longer can you hide? I'm not hiding, sir. I transferred from my college just to come here and try out for your team. I am deeply moved. What's your name? Samantha Booke. - Book? - With an "e." Arise, Miss Booke. With an "e." Into the hot spot, Miss Booke with an "e." You know, there's never been a female on the debating team, ever. Yes, sir. I know that. What makes you think you should be the first? Because, sir, I am just as qualified as... - quit stammering, Miss Booke. - Anybody else here. - My gender has nothing... - "Resolved: Welfare discourages hard work." - You'll argue the negative. - All right. Welfare takes away a man's strongest reason for working, which is survival. And that weakens the will of the poor. How would you rebut that, Miss Booke with an "e"? I would say it does not. Most of the New Deal goes to children, anyway, and to the handicapped, and to old people... - Is that fact, or conjecture? - It is a fact. - Speak up. - It is a fact. - What's your source? - The president. - Of the United States? - Yes, sir. That's your primary source? You spoke to President Roosevelt personally? Of course not. I did not speak to him personally, but I listened to his Fireside Chat. - Oh, a radio broadcast. - Yes. - Any other sources? - Well... Any other sources? Yes, there are other sources. Like that look in a mother's eyes when she can't feed her kids. Without welfare, Mr Tolson, people would be starving. Who's starving, Miss Booke? - The unemployed are starving. - Mr Burgess here. He's unemployed. Obviously, he's not starving. I drew you in, Miss Booke. You gave a faulty premise, so your syllogism fell apart. - "Syllogism"? - Your logic fell apart. Major premise: The unemployed are starving. Minor premise: Mr Burgess is unemployed. Conclusion: Mr Burgess is starving. Your major premise was based on a faulty assumption. Classic fallacy. Who's next? You were right. Tell us your name. I'm Henry Lowe. With an "e." All right, Mr Lowe. I will name a subject. You speak a few words... a pertinent quote from world literature. Go ahead. Beauty. "I heard the old, old men say, all that is beautiful drifts away, like the waters." Very good. History. And name the author this time. "History is a nightmare, from which I am trying to awake." James Joyce. Self-pity. "I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself." D.H. Lawrence. I love D.H. Lawrence. Have you ever read... Mr Farmer. Yes, sir? I have eyes in the back of my head and ears on both sides. Stand up. Tell me the irony in the name "Bethlehem Steel Corporation." Bethlehem is the birthplace of Jesus, Prince of Peace, and Bethlehem Steel makes weapons of war. Very good. Sit down. Good. Who's next? That went well. How will we know how we did? Samantha. Samantha. Tolson's tough, isn't he? He sure is. I'm James. Is your father Dr James Farmer? Yes... yes, he is. I'm taking theology from him, and that man speaks in tongues. French, Greek, Hebrew, Latin... How many languages does he speak? - Seven languages. - "Seven languages." He must be the smartest man in Texas. Well, that's not saying much. So why do you want to be on the team? I think it would be good training. For what? Being a lawyer. Lawyer? That's great. You know how many Negro women practise law in this state? - Two. - Exactly. One of them's my aunt. Well, look at you, Mr Farmer. How old are you, anyway? I'll be 16... in 21 months. Young lady. James. I just wanted to thank you. For what? Well, for your performance tonight. I mean, how many other students ever stand up to Tolson? - I did. - No. You answered a question, and I spouted a few quotes. Miss Booke with an "e," - she fought back. - And lost. But you didn't have to lose. Why isn't a Fireside Chat a legitimate source? Because Tolson says so? Nobody has better access to those statistics than the president. Now, if you'd have called Tolson on that, you would have won. I don't know. I'm sure that man would have come up with something. Good night, James. Can you believe he's Good night, Samantha. 14 years old, and he's in college? You are gifted, all of you. So I want you to know that I chose this team for balance, and none of you should take it as a failure... as a denigration of your intellect. Denigrate. There's a word for you. From the Latin word "niger," to defame, to blacken. It's always there, isn't it? Even in the dictionary. Even in the speech of a Negro professor. Somehow, "black" is always equated with failure. Well, write your own dictionary. And mark this as a new beginning, whether you make the team or not. The Wiley College Forensics Society of 1935-1936 is as follows: The debaters... will be Mr Hamilton Burgess from last year's team... - Yea. - Sit down, Mr Burgess. Mr Henry Lowe. Our alternates. Miss Samantha Booke. With an "e." And finally... Junior, slow down. - Where's Dad? - Quiet. He's writing a lecture. - Dad. - Junior. What is the greatest weakness of man? Not believing? Doubt? That's it. Thank you, Junior. Matthew 14:31. - That will be the lesson. - Dad. "O you of little faith, why do you doubt me?" Dad? What is it, son? I made the debate team. Well, congratulations. And who is on your team? There's four of us. I'm one of the alternates. Who's ahead of you? Hamilton Burgess and Henry Lowe. And the other alternate's Samantha Booke. There's a girl? She wants to be a lawyer. - A lawyer? - She's very intelligent. Is she pretty? I don't know. I never really noticed. Because extracurricular activities like the debate team are fine, but you must not take your eye off the ball, son. - Yes, sir. - Hmph. So what do we do here? We do what we have to do, so we can do what we want to do. What do you have to do right now? - My homework. - So get to it. Yes, sir. My daddy owns a grocery store that has apples, bananas, cookies, doughnuts, eggs, figs, and "gonzola" beans. Right. What's a gonzola bean? - Hogwash. - Hogwash. "Gonzola" bean? Ready, set, go. - Apricots... - Hogwash. What, no apricots? Look out. What was that? I'm not sure. Sit down. You stay put. Be still. What is it? It's a pig. Hit a pig. Shut up, dog. Junior, get in the car. What the hell happened to my hog? Sorry about that. Came out of nowhere. I didn't see it coming. You done killed my hog, boy. Truly sorry. Gladly pay you for it. How much... How much you want? It's gonna cost you $25. Only have a few bucks on me right now, but I can... I do have a check. My monthly check, for Wiley College in Marshall. It's for $17.36. You may have that. I will endorse that over to you. You'll do what? I will sign the check over to you. Well, let me see it. It's in the car, with my wife. Gonna walk to the car now. Junior, get in the car. Give me that salary check, Pearl. We need that money, James. Just give me the check. Go on. His wife has it. I thought it was in here. Just relax. It's all right. It's in here. You'll find it. Here it is. Here it is. That check better be good, boy. It's good. Well, pick it up. Here it is. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where the hell do you think you're going? You got to help us get this hog in my truck. Come on. Grab the tail end of that, boy. All right, on three. One, two, three. Town niggers. They think they're too good to get their hands dirty. - Dad... - I told you to get in the car. When I tell you to do something, Junior, you do it. Who's the judge? The judge is God. Why is he God? Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent. Who is your opponent? He doesn't exist. Why does he not exist? He's merely a dissenting voice to the truth I speak. Who's the judge? - The judge is God. - The judge is God. Why is he God? Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent. Who is your opponent? He doesn't exist. Why doesn't he exist? Because he is merely a dissenting voice to the truth I speak. Who's the judge? The judge is God. Why is he God? Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent. Who's your opponent? He doesn't exist. Why does he not exist? Because he is merely a dissenting voice to the truth I speak. Who's the judge? The judge is God. Louder. The judge is God. Why is he God? Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent. Who's your opponent? He doesn't exist. Why does he not exist? Because he is merely a dissenting voice to the truth I speak. Speak the truth. Speak the truth. Yes, sir, I do like to talk. Is that a virtue or a vice? Well, I have to admit I've always wanted to be the quiet, mysterious type, only I couldn't keep my mouth shut long enough. Would you punch yourself in a street fight, Mr Burgess? No, sir. Then don't punch yourself in a word fight. You don't have to make fun of yourself. Use your humour against your opponent. Mr Farmer. Yes, sir. Happy Mr Farmer. Tell us one thing we don't know about your father. He was the first Negro Ph... One thing we don't know about your father, Mr Farmer. He walked from Florida to Massachusetts to go to college at Boston University. He graduated magna cum laude. Mr Lowe. Tell us about your father. Why don't you tell us something about your father? We're trying to get to know each other, Mr Lowe. I was trying to get to know you, Mr Tolson. I'm not the one on the debate team. Are we not engaged in a debate right now? All right. I'll take the affirmative. Take the meanest... most restless nigger, strip him of his clothes in front of the remaining male niggers, female niggers, and nigger infants. Tar and feather him. Tie each leg to a horse facing an opposite direction, set him on fire, and beat both horses until they tear him apart in front of the male, female, and nigger infants. Bullwhip and beat the remaining nigger males within an inch of their life. Do not kill them, but put the fear of God in them, for they can be useful for future breeding. Anybody know who Willie Lynch was? Anybody? Raise your hand. No one? He was a vicious slave owner in the West Indies. The slave-masters in the colony of Virginia were having trouble controlling their slaves, so they sent for Mr Lynch to teach them his methods. The word "lynching" came from his last name. His methods were very simple, but they were diabolical. Keep the slave physically strong but psychologically weak and dependent on the slave master. Keep the body, take the mind. I... and every other professor on this campus are here to help you... to find, take back, and keep your righteous mind... because obviously you have lost it. That's all you need to know about me, Mr Lowe. Class dismissed. Hey. Here you go, honey. Thank you. Want to dance? Yes. Come on. You're a good dancer. Thank you. I... I practise in my room. Keep at it. Excuse me. Your punch. Thank you. I guess I better go get me some punch. Here, you can have mine if you want. It's good. All right? You know I can take you to a place that plays real music, right? I'm not leaving here, Henry. Just for a spell. I'll bring you right back. And what would my chaperone say? We'll be back before she ever knows you're gone. What's the matter? You afraid? What's the matter? You afraid? Excuse me. Mr Tolson? Mr Tolson. ♪ Hoo ♪ ♪ Woo-hoo ♪ ♪ I remember down on block number 9 ♪ ♪ Couldn't hear nothing but them old convicts whine ♪ ♪ Singing "How long ♪ ♪ Before I can change my clothes?" ♪ It's time. Let's go. Break your back all day. And it's not right when they lie to the government and tell them that sharecroppers are just wage earners so they don't have to split their farmer's subsidies with you. And that's why the Southern Tenant Farmers Union wants you to organise: To make things right. How? Strike? Hell, they'll just bring in the Mexicans. We'll organise them, too. Yeah, so they can shoot us all down: White, coloured, and Mexican. That's exactly what they want you to believe. The farm bosses want you to believe they'll make war. They won't. They may be fools, but they're smart businessmen. And once we're organised, they'll see even guns can't stop us. Stopped them in Elaine. Why don't you talk about that? About how they killed a hundred coloured sharecroppers for trying to organise. That was 1919, friend. And that was my daddy they gunned down, friend. We're sorry about that. But those men stood alone. That's my point. This is 1935. We've got the National Labour Relations Board. We've got the AF of I. You ain't got shit. He ain't got shit. Here they come. Here they come. Get the lights. Everybody get down. Get down. Come on. Let's get out of here. This way. This way. This way. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right. All right. What are you doing out here? Huh? I saw you... I was walking by your house, and I saw you dressed funny. I'm dressed like them, son. You think they'd listen to me if I was wearing a tuxedo? Huh? No, sir. Listen to me. You listening? You cannot tell anybody what you saw tonight. You understand? Not even my wife knows about this. I won't tell anybody, I promise. I promise on a stack of Bibles... Jesus. I won't tell anybody. Come on. Junior? Are you just going to stand there? No, sir. Sorry I'm late. You're sorry? It's 1:00 in the morning. I've been looking everywhere for you. I went to Mr Tolson's house after the dance. I thought you might have done that. That's why I went over there. And I talked to Ruth. She said Tolson was gone and that you weren't there. So I'm going to give you another chance. Where were you? I can't tell you, sir. Good Lord, boy. We've been worried to death about you. Junior... where were you? I can't tell you, sir. Why not? I don't know. "I don't know." "I don't know" is not an acceptable answer, Junior. Junior. Silence is not an option, either. Son, you been drinking? Honey... Because you must've been drinking coming up in my house talking about you don't want to tell me where you been at 1:30 in the morning? Baby, tell me, what's the matter? Mum, nothing's the matter. Something's the matter. Something is wrong. Were you with that girl? - You were with that girl. - No. Because you're 14 years old, Junior. You've got plenty of time for girls later. I wasn't with Samantha. Junior. Then where were you? Where were you, honey? You don't want to talk? Fine. But you're not leaving this house. What do you mean? Just what I said. You're not leaving this house until you tell me the truth. What about school? Don't go questioning what I just said, boy. Mum, what about school? And don't raise your voice. I'm not raising my voice. You raising your voice in the house? Apologise to your father. I'm not raising my voice. You get a job, pay your own way? You're a man now? I'm not raising my voice. Just apologise. I didn't say anything. Why should I apologise? Like you apologised to that pig farmer? What did you say, boy? You go to your room. Okay, Junior... I'm not going to be weak on this, Pearl. I know. I can't allow my son to be corrupted. You're right. Let's just go to bed. I'll take him to school in the morning. All right? All right. I'm going to be honest with you, boys. I'm not well. I'm not well at all this morning. I'm sure sorry to hear that, sir. You look well to me. Don't he look well, Sam? Yes, sir. He looks real good. Now, we got some white fellas from up north come into our town. They're stirring up trouble between our coloureds and our whites. They say that we need to make a union: The sharecroppers and the workers all together, coloured and white. They need to make a union? How do you boys feel about that? I don't know, sir. I really ain't thought much about that. Well, it's a bad idea. It's a bad idea, take my word for it. Yes, sir. And they say that there was some kind of secret meeting last night down near the lake. Now, do you boys know about that? No, sir. You don't know about that? - Samuel? - No, sir. - You didn't hear about that? - No, sir. - You swear to me? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I swear. All right, then. See you later. Our first debate is one week from today. - One week? - That's right. I thought Prairie View was first. Prairie View is tough, so I thought we needed a warm-up. With the best Negro college in the state? That's right, Mr Burgess. Does that frighten you? Yes, sir. One week's not enough time to write our arguments. You do the research. I'll write the arguments. Wait. You... You write the arguments? And you deliver them, Mr Lowe. What the hell do I look like, a postman? Hell is where you're headed if you question me again. In theory, you look like a student. So what you're saying is I'm not capable. It's not a matter of competence. It's a matter of experience. How do I know you write... I write the arguments. That's the way it's been. That's the way it's going to be. Any more questions? One week. I bring to you our first affirmative debater: From Paul quinn College, Otheree Hubbard. Resolved: Unemployment relief should be ended when the Depression ends. If the Depression ends. I travelled back through history to 1536, when the first Poor Laws of England were mandated. In those days, the dole... or welfare, as we call it... was funded by voluntary contributions. But, as time passed, the English devised the Allowance System, the first unemployment relief, only now it was paid with involuntary contributions, more commonly known as taxes. The Allowance System was a disaster. The only real unemployment relief is to give a man a job. But to do that, you have to give the economy life, not tax it to death. When capitalism was young, the old puritanical concept of duty was, "He who does not work shall not eat." That made sense when there was more work than men willing to do it. But those days are gone. Now there are millions who want to work, but find themselves standing in breadlines. Now, should they not eat because there are no jobs? People, today we need a new concept of duty: The right of the individual to demand from society just as much as he gives to society. We clutch at anything that even looks like a solution. $60 million a month for public relief? Pay it out if it'll sweep the hoboes off the streets. One seventh of the population of the United States on welfare. Fine, as long as it ends our misery. A nation as desperate as this is a danger to itself. That's right. Once, a Roman general brought peace to a rebellious province... by killing all its citizens. Even his fellow Romans were shocked. One of them wrote, "Solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant," which means "They create desolation and call it peace." Now, for all their facts and figures, the Paul quinn debaters would also create desolation and call it peace. They would allow the unemployed to die so the economy can live. A brilliant young woman I know was asked once to support her argument in favour of social welfare. She named the most powerful source imaginable: The look in a mother's face when she cannot feed her children. Can you look that hungry child in the eyes? See the blood on his feet from walking barefoot in the cotton fields? Or do you ask his baby sister with her belly swollen from hunger if she cares about her daddy's work ethic? He's good. Wiley.

I guess that's just the way the world is. Isn't that right, Samuel? I have an announcement to make. Excuse me. Recently, I... we... sent some letters to some major universities. Told them all about us, our team, what we've been doing, and, yesterday we got a response. From Oklahoma City University. Aren't they...? Anglo-Saxon? Yes. Yes. We'll be the first Negro college in America... well, one of the first Negro colleges in America... to ever debate a white college. All right. University of Oklahoma. Not University of Oklahoma. Oklahoma City University. The debate will take place at an off-campus site. Wait. An off-campus site? Why? Because sometimes, Mr Lowe, you have to take things one step at a time. So what you're saying is the crackers in Oklahoma ain't gonna let us on their campus. No, what I'm saying is you have to take things one step at a time. This is a great opportunity. Thank you very much. Master is going to give us a crumb off his plate, huh? What? Wha... I think Lowe here is afraid. What am I afraid of, James? I think you're afraid to debate white people. - Anglo-Saxons. - Anglo-Saxons. Thank you very much. Mr Tolson, let me debate. I mean, I'll debate Anglo-Saxons anywhere: In a dark alley, with no light, with a candle lit and people chasing you down with guns. Hell, I'll debate Anglo-Saxons anywhere. I ain't afraid. I am. Mr Tolson, when I came here today, I saw the sheriff outside watching your house. What's going on? Maybe you should ask the sheriff. I've been hearing a lot of rumours about what you're doing. My dad just called the Dean last week and asked, "What is a communist doing teaching at a good Methodist college?" My politics are my business, Mr Burgess, and I promise you that they will not endanger the team. But, sir, it is being endangered. I came to Wiley College to be educated, not investigated. I understand that. I don't want to be dragged into anything. - You're not... - If my parents find... I'm sorry. Mr Tolson, please. Just tell me you're not a communist. Otherwise... Otherwise what? Otherwise what? My father says I have to quit. Nobody wants that. Then tell me. As I said, my politics are my business. I guess I have to resign. Mrs Tolson, thank you for a wonderful dinner. You're welcome, Ham. Good luck in Oklahoma, you all. I know you'll win. All right. Well, if anybody else wants to quit, I'll understand. Resolved: Negroes should be... should be admitted... I can't hear you. Speak up. Resolved... Negroes should be admitted to state universities. My partner and I will prove that blocking a Negro's admission to a state university is not only wrong, it is absurd. The Negro people are not just a colour in the American fabric. They are the thread that holds it all together. Consider the legal and historical record. May 13, 1865: Sergeant Crocker, a Negro, is the last soldier to die in the Civil War. 1918: The first US Soldiers decorated for bravery in France are Negroes Henry Johnson and Needham Roberts. 1920: The New York Times announces that the "N" in Negro would hereafter be capitalised. To force upon the South what they are not ready for would result in nothing but more racial hatred. What? Dr W.E.B. Dubois... he's perhaps the most eminent Negro scholar in America. He comments... "It's a silly waste of money, time, and temper "to try and compel a powerful majority to do what they are determined not to do." My opponent so conveniently chose to ignore the fact that W.E.B. Dubois is the first Negro to receive a PhD from a white college called Harvard. Dr Dubois, he adds, "It is impossible... impossible for a Negro to receive a proper education at a white college." The most eminent Negro scholar in America is the product of an Ivy League education. You see, Dubois knows all too well the white man's resistance to change. But that's no reason to keep a black man out of any college. If someone didn't force upon the South something it wasn't ready for, I'd still be in chains, and Miss Booke here would be running from her old Master. I do admit it. It is true. Far too many whites are afflicted with the disease of racial hatred. And because of racism, it would be impossible for a Negro to be happy at a southern white college today. That's true. And if someone is unhappy, it is impossible to see how they could receive a proper education. That's right. Yes, a time will come when Negroes and whites will walk on the same campus and we will share the same classrooms. But sadly, that day is not today. As long as schools are segregated, Negroes will receive an education that is both separate and unequal. By Oklahoma's own reckoning, the state is currently spending five times more for the education of a white child than it is spending to educate a coloured child. That means better textbooks for that child than for that child. Oh, I say that's a shame, but my opponent says today is not the day for whites and coloureds to go to the same college, to share the same campus, to walk in the same classroom. Well, would you kindly tell me when is that day gonna come? Is it gonna come tomorrow? Is it gonna come next week? In a hundred years? Never? No, the time for justice, the time for freedom, and the time for equality is always, is always, right now. Thank you. What is this? I told you it was holy wine. Put hair on your chest. If you say so. Good, ain't it? Huh. You know where the bathroom is if you need it. Yeah. And my weapons were words. I didn't need a gun. I didn't need a knife. You see... Meet me outside in five minutes. And then what? Yes, I did, honey, and nobody knows that better than you know. Oh, I'm fine. How are you doing, Pearl? Pearl. Yes, I do. Where's your husband? - He's in the study. - Okay. Dr Farmer. Congratulations, Melvin. Thank you. You've put us on the map. Well, your son is doing a great job. His research is impeccable. That's good to hear. That's good to hear. Listen, there are people around town who aren't very happy with your off-campus activities. They're calling you a radical. In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find out one morning when I woke up that you were strung up to a tree. They'd have to catch me first. This is serious, Melvin. Very serious. A hungry Negro steals a chicken, he goes to jail. A rich businessman steals bonds, he goes to Congress. I think that's wrong. Now, if that makes me a radical, a socialist, a communist, so be it. Amen... Amen on that. - Jesus was a radical. - Careful. Yes, He was. Jesus was a radical. Mental institutions are filled with people who have confused themselves with Jesus Christ. I'm not confused. You're convinced you're Jesus Christ now? No. You're convinced you're Jesus Christ? You know what words do. - Okay. - Come on now. Amen. Don't want to confuse yourself with Jesus Christ. I'm not confused. I'm convinced. I'm not, I'm not judging you. I'm just concerned about your methods. What methods? James was there that night, wasn't he? He was not with me. Is he involved in this? Of course not, James. I've done everything in my power to keep him out of this. - To keep him out? - Yes. Are you telling me he wants to be involved? Maybe this is something you should discuss with him. I'm discussing it with you right now, and I don't feel like I'm getting a straight answer. You're getting a straight answer. I think that you were there with him that night. He was not with me. He's a 14-year-old boy. I understand that. I'll do whatever I have to do to protect him. Is anybody thirsty? Here you are. Thank you. Thank you, Ruth. You're welcome. Okay. Ruth, this is a fine party. Thank you. I think it's time for some sweet potato pie. Please. I'll help you with that. Not the time to talk about it. Congratulations. Thank you. It's so beautiful out here. Yeah. I was born near here, a little further up the lake near Jefferson. I've been coming here since I was a little boy. Your parents still live around here? No, no. They're, they're gone. My grandparents raised me. And my Pah-Pah, he, spent his life doing the levees around here... for free, of course. Mm. He was a slave? My grandma was always telling me to be good or else the Confederates would rise up out of Marshall Cemetery and get me. Boy. What? I've just never seen this side of you before. What side? You seem so calm, so peaceful. It's what the lake does to me. I'm happy when I'm out here, you know? It's funny. Part of me wants to just stay out here by the lake, you know? Read books all day and hunt and fish when I get hungry. And the other part wants to go everywhere, you know, see everything. I want to go to New Orleans and New York and Chicago and even San Francisco. I just want to go... walking down the road and... just disappear. Well, maybe you could take me with you. - Lord. - What? It's the school band, and they're outside. What? Jesus. I thought you said nobody ever comes around here. Nobody ever does come here, Samantha. Hold on. Hold on. Henry, come on. Henry. Get dressed. What's going on? We're gonna go get Mr Tolson and Samantha, head back to the campus, and have a pep rally. Come on, get dressed. You know what? You go get Tolson, and I'll meet up with you all later on campus. Come on, Lowe. You know it's going to be fun. I guess I'll tell them you're going to join us later? He's going to join us later. He just has to clean his house, that's all. Great news. Great news. Great news. My phone has been ringing off the hook. University of Michigan wants to debate us. So does SMU. So does Georgia. Where's Mr Lowe? When do I get to debate? Sooner than you think, James. Sooner than you think. When? When you're ready. I'm ready now. Mr Tolson, I do not mind if James... What's wrong? Maybe I'm tired of this. Of what? Of watching other people debate. When am I going to get a chance to prove myself? You're our best researcher, James. We could not do this without you. You do plenty without me. Excuse me. - James. - What? James, you wait. That was so mean what you said in there. All right, look, I don't want to lose your friendship. How can you lose something that you never had? You were never my friend? Maybe I don't want to just be your friend. Maybe it hurts me to be your friend. - What's going on? - What's going on? Grab his hands. Mr Tolson. Where is he? Calm down, Henry. Have you seen him? No, they won't let us. They didn't do nothing to you, did they? - No, we're fine. - Deputy, I'm Dr James Farmer of Wiley College. This is William Taylor, Mr Tolson's attorney. And this is his wife Ruth. Hello. I'd like to see my client, please. William. Sheriff Dozier. Dr James Farmer... Hello, William. How you doing today? Fine, sir, thank you. And you? Oh, not too bad, not too bad. Me and William, we go way back. I knew William when I was a boy. Could I see my client now, Sheriff? Your client? Well, the fact of the business is, William, your client is kind of busy right now. Busy doing what? Sheriff. Sheriff. We have a situation. Get some of your boys out there. All right, men. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. They with you? That's right. See? This is what happens to a town when you let the unions in. Starts trouble. People get all riled up about nothing. One of them's liable to get hurt, if you catch my drift. Sheriff, since it's clear that you have no evidence to arrest Mr Tolson, I suggest you let him go. You suggest it? Who the hell are you? Couple of months ago, there was a raid on Floyd Tillman's barn. It was a peaceful and lawful gathering of sharecroppers who were brutally attacked by a gang of violent vigilantes. Now, witnesses say that you were there. If you led that raid, Sheriff, you're the one who broke the law, not Tolson. Are you threatening me, boy? No, sir. I wouldn't do that. But I cannot speak for those people outside. An unjust law is no law at all. What does that mean? A mass slaughter of citizens, both white and coloured, by Texas Rangers? Is that really what you want as the Sheriff of this county? Now, if you let Tolson go home, I believe... I believe that these folks outside, they'll go home as well. That pig wasn't worth $25. What? You owe my father some money. Have a seat, Mr Farmer. Oh, Lord. SMU has cancelled. University of Georgia sounds like they will follow suit. Why? I've been blacklisted. They're talking about censuring me. Dean Clay and the board have asked me to stop working with the sharecroppers, or else. They say that it is not my fight. So... things are bad. My academic career's in jeopardy. My debate team has nowhere to go. Anyone know who Antaeus was? Sure. He was a gigantic wrestler in Greek mythology. His mother was, Gaea, the goddess of Earth, and, I mean, he was unbeatable because anytime someone threw him down to the Earth, it would make him stronger. That's correct. It would make him stronger. Defeat would make him stronger. You are my students. I am your teacher. I think that's a sacred trust. So what do I say to you now? Quit because the Dean says so? Because the sheriff says so? Because the Texas Rangers say so? No. I am diametrically opposed to that. My message to you is to never quit. We are not quitting. Good. What do you want us to do? Debate Harvard. - Harvard? - Harvard University. They're the reigning national champions. If we defeat them, we defeat the best. Mr Tolson, sir, with all due respect, Harvard ain't going to debate us, not little old Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. They know who we are, Henry. I've been writing them letters, sending them articles. But how do we get a letter back? By continuing to win. Dr Farmer has informed me that Howard University is going to be at Prairie View next week. We annihilated Fisk. If we eliminate Howard, we will have beaten the two best Negro colleges in America, and I can guarantee you that I will see to it that Harvard does not ignore that. All right? Yeah. ♪ You guys, scoodle um skoo ♪ ♪ Oh, baby, let's scoodle um skoo ♪ ♪ Come on, Mama, and scoodle um skoo ♪ ♪ Scoodle um scoodle um, and scoodle um skoo ♪ Just look for it on there.

What do you think he did? He didn't have to do nothing, James. He didn't have to do nothing. In Texas they lynch Negroes. Do you understand? So it doesn't matter how good we are, does it? What are you talk... What? This is all useless. What are you talking about? I mean we're just a bunch of Negroes debating each other on subjects we all agree on. Now, James, don't talk like that, all right? - Why not? - Because you can't. Not you. Bye. God bless you. Where's Samantha? She's not going with us. Why not? Why do you think? I took her to the bus station. She wanted to go back to school. You wanted your chance. This is it. But how can any Negro defend the punishment of prison when he's seen so much oppression in his own life? Yeah. How? Because crime itself is a form of oppression, and Negroes fall victim to more violent crime than any other race in America. For us, prison not only offers protection, but retribution. Yes, indeed. And for the criminal, it is a dark gift: The hardship that introduces a man to himself, that rouses his passion for freedom... Yes, sir. His hope for redemption. Oh, yeah. Our next debater from Wiley College, Mr James Farmer, Junior. Mr Farmer? Mum? Mum. Honey. Hey. Hi. Oh. So? We lost. Oh. I'm sorry. This came. Harvard. Wonder what it says. Go on and open it and read it. Looks like somebody opened it already. Not me. You didn't open it already? No. You are not a good liar. Out loud. "Dear Mr Tolson, "thank you for informing us "about your historic victory over Oklahoma City. "I'm sure you realise our season is nearly over, "but today we received another letter from Wiley College written by Mr Henry Lowe"? With an "e"? "He told us from a student's perspective about your"...ahem... "about your undefeated season." Well, we're not undefeated any more. Don't matter. "We wish to extend an invitation to..." "We wish to extend an invitation "to debate Harvard Crimson here in Cambridge. Let us know if this is agreeable to you." Honey... Don't you tell anybody. No. No, you don't have to thank me. I just wanted to show you I could write, too. That's good. Thank you. But you could do me a favour. What's that? Keep Samantha on the team. Why would I do that? Mr Tolson, it was a rough night. Yes, it was, Mr Lowe, for all of us. And she walked out on us at the last minute. No, sir. She did not walk out on us. She walked out on me. It's good tea. Resolved: Capitalism is immoral. We will be arguing the affirmative. To a bunch of Wall Street bankers. Mr Tolson, I owe you and my teammates... You're late. Come in. Sit down. Samantha, I am not... Resolved. Okay, you got macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, black-eyed peas for good luck, red beans and rice, corn bread, candied yams. I put some peach cobbler in there, too, and some bread pudding. I know you don't like bread pudding, but I put it in there anyway. Thank you, Mum. Okay. Good luck, son. Dad? Yes, Jim. You give Boston my regards. You hear? Yes, sir. James. Come on. Train's leaving. Coming. - Bye, Mum. - Bye-bye. I love you. Bye, sis. Love you. Love you, too. All aboard leaving for Texarkana, Little Rock, St. Louis, and all points north. All aboard. I'm not going with you. What? I cannot leave this state. It's a condition of my bail. You can't let them stop you. They're not stopping me. I just don't want to jeopardise your opportunity. You can win without me. This is what you wanted to do all along, isn't it? He's right. Why didn't you tell us this before? Because I didn't want to hear your arguments. I knew they'd be too good. All right, Mr Lowe, you're in charge. Whatever your instincts tell you, you listen. Yes, sir. Let's go. Let's go. What are we supposed to do without you? Win. Chicago Express, with service to Hartford, New York, and Philadelphia, now boarding, Track 29. I thought somebody was supposed to meet us. Wiley College? - Yes. - Yes. I'm Harland Osbourne. Harvard has put me in charge of you for the time that you'll be here in Boston. - How you doing? I'm Henry Lowe. - Mr Lowe. - James Farmer, Jr. - Mr Farmer. - Samantha Booke. - Of course. Miss Booke. We should be going. My car's out front. I've got it. Oh, thank you. Just so you know, you'll be staying on campus in Douglas Hall. I've got to tell you, this debate is stirring up a lot of excitement. - Really? - Oh, yeah. It's gonna be broadcast all over America. Can we see where we're going to debate? Of course. Hello, Harvard. Excuse me. You supposed to be here? I guess we'll find out, won't we? Ah. Well, look. "Mr Farmer." $5.00? Lowe, I got $5.00. Yeah, I did, too. It's called per diem. Hoo-hoo. You want me to hold it for you? No, not my $5.00. I got $5.00. I got $5.00. Me, too. Well, mine is crispy. James, this is high tea, all right? We nibble. We do not devour. How do you know? I don't. Hello. I'm Wilson. This is for you. Thank you. I can't accept that, sir. It would be inappropriate. It would be inappropriate. Who's it from? It's from Harvard. Maybe it's more money. "We have been informed by Tau Kappa Gamma "that your team delivers... "canned speeches: "Arguments written by faculty rather than students. "Therefore, we are changing the topic. "You will have the same amount of time "to write new arguments as the Harvard team: 48 hours." Coaches help students all the time. Yes, sir. "Both teams will be delivered the same reference books." Yes, sir. "Our new topic: Resolved: "Civil disobedience is a moral weapon in the fight for justice." Wiley College will be arguing the affirmative." Thank you, sir. I can't reach Mr Tolson. Nobody knows where he is. They're setting us up to lose. We can't win without him. You're wrong. We can't win without him. Thoreau? "Less desponding free spirits, is in her prisons..." "Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man..." Here's your coffee, sir. Thank you, Mr Wilson. Just Wilson. Thank you, Wilson. "Has provided for her freer "and less desponding spirits..." But you have to use the Massacre at Amritsar. Agreed, James, but we'll save it for the rebuttal. We're going to save the best for last because you have to leave the audience... I think we should get into Gandhi's concept of Satyagraha. I don't agree. I don't think people are gonna understand what... what... Sadagara? Sactchmaget? Sactchma... Satyagraha. From the Sanskrit. Meaning truth and fairness. I told you. It's obvious to me that we should begin the debate with Gandhi. That's exactly why I won't do it. Why should I do the obvious thing? Because that's what wins debates. Listen to what you're saying. This is Harvard, okay? The first thing you think when you think civil disobedience is what? That's why we should use Gandhi. But Gandhi is a strong point. I want to win. Do you want to win? Yes, I want to win, but he's right. This is not getting us anywhere. Tolson told me I was in charge. He didn't put you in charge. You're "in charge" does not mean... So I can make decisions. We're not starting with Gandhi. Yes, we are. Do you hear yourself? You sound like a kid. Well, you are a kid. Fellas, come on. - I'm an idiot? - Yes. To hell with you. To hell with you. To hell with this debate. To hell with me? To hell with me? Just because I disagree with you? If you're gonna walk out, fine. We're not chasing you. We are so tired of chasing you. He's coming back, isn't he? See if I care. How you doing, man? You're beautiful when you're asleep. Henry, I... Yeah, I know, I know. But you can't stop me from looking at you. Can everybody shut up and go to bed? James, come on, wake up. No. James. Come on, James, get up. What? What is this? That's my notes. What are you giving them to me for? Because you're debating, not me. What? It's your turn, James. You serious? You're crazy. At 14, you're just as good as me. The judges will love you. No. No. You can't quit. I'm not quitting, Samantha. Tolson made me captain, and he said you were ready. Yeah, but you saw me at Howard. I was horrible. That's right. You did terrible, didn't you? Stunk up the whole joint, right? So you should just quit, right? You should just give up. No. Who's the judge? What? Who's the judge? The judge is God. And why is he God? Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent. And who is your opponent? He doesn't exist. Why doesn't he exist? Because he is a mere a dissenting voice to the truth that I speak. That's right. Speak the truth. Direct from Harvard Memorial Hall in Cambridge, Massachusetts, this is WNBC Radio, bringing to you live tonight's history-making debate between little Wiley College from Marshall, Texas, and the Harvard University Debate team, the first time ever a Negro college has faced the national champions. Harvard's Dean of Students is making his way to the podium now. The crowd, as if on cue, falls silent. On this historic occasion, we welcome the distinguished team from Wiley College, our illustrious judges, you the audience, and through the wonder of radio, the nation. Harvard University celebrates its 300th anniversary this year, and, in Franklin Delano Roosevelt, its fifth President of the United States. But no university, no matter how grand or august in its history, can afford to live in the past. So, in the spirit of tomorrow, I introduce to you today: The debaters from Wiley College: Miss Samantha Booke, Mr James Farmer, Junior. What? Mr Farmer will argue the first affirmative. Resolved: Civil disobedience is a moral weapon in the fight for justice. But how can disobedience ever be moral? Well, I guess that depends on one's definition of the words. Word. In 1919, in India, 10,000 people gathered in Amritsar to protest the tyranny of British rule. Has it started? Your brother's talking. Just sit down. General Reginald Dyer trapped them in a courtyard and ordered his troops to fire into the crowd for ten minutes. 379 died... men, women, children... Shot down in cold blood. Dyer said he had taught them a moral lesson. Gandhi and his followers responded not with violence but with an organised campaign of non-cooperation. Government buildings were occupied. Streets were blocked with people who refused to rise, even when beaten by police. Gandhi was arrested, but the British were soon forced to release him. He called it a moral victory. The definition of moral: Dyer's lesson or Gandhi's victory? You choose. From 1914 to 1918, for every single minute the world was at war, four men laid down their lives. Just think of it. 240 brave young men were hurled into eternity every hour of every day, of every night, for four long years. 35,000 hours. 8,281,000 casualties. 240. 240. 240. Here was a slaughter immeasurably greater than what happened at Amritsar. Can there be anything moral about it? Nothing... except that it stopped Germany from enslaving all of Europe. Civil disobedience isn't moral because it's non-violent. Fighting for your country with violence can be deeply moral, demanding the greatest sacrifice of all: Life itself. Non-violence is the mask civil disobedience wears to conceal its true face... anarchy. Gandhi believes one must always act with love and respect for one's opponents, even if they are Harvard debaters. Gandhi also believes that lawbreakers must accept the legal consequences for their actions. Does that sound like anarchy? Civil disobedience is not something for us to fear. It is, after all, an American concept. You see, Gandhi draws his inspiration not from a Hindu scripture, but from Henry David Thoreau, who I believe graduated from Harvard and lived by a pond not too far from here. My opponent is right about one thing. Thoreau was a Harvard grad, and, like many of us, a bit self-righteous. He once said, "Any man more right than his neighbours constitutes a majority of one." Thoreau the idealist could never know that Adolf Hitler would agree with his words. The beauty and the burden of democracy is this: No idea prevails without the support of the majority. The people decide the moral issues of the day, not a majority of one. Majorities do not decide what is right or wrong. Your conscience does. So why should a citizen surrender his or her conscience to a legislator? No, we must never, ever kneel down before the tyranny of a majority. We can't decide which laws to obey and which to ignore. If we could... I'd never stop for a red light. My father is one of those men that stands between us and chaos: A police officer. I remember the day his partner, his best friend, was gunned down in the line of duty. Most vividly of all, I remember the expression on my dad's face. Nothing that erodes the rule of law can be moral, no matter what name we give it. Bravo. Why doesn't he say something? In Texas... they lynch Negroes. My teammates and I saw a man strung up by his neck and set on fire. We drove through a lynch mob, pressed our faces against the floorboard. I looked at my teammates. I saw the fear in their eyes... and worse... the shame. What was this Negro's crime that he should be hung, without trial, in a dark forest filled with fog? Was he a thief? Was he a killer? Or just a Negro? Was he a sharecropper? A preacher? Were his children waiting up for him? And who are we to just lie there and do nothing? No matter what he did, the mob was the criminal. But the law did nothing, just left us wondering why. My opponent says nothing that erodes the rule of law can be moral. But there is no rule of law in the Jim Crow South, not when Negroes are denied housing, turned away from schools, hospitals, and not when we are lynched. St. Augustine said, "An unjust law is no law at all," which means I have a right, even a duty, to resist... with violence or civil disobedience. You should pray I choose the latter. Bravo. In tonight's debate between Harvard University and Wiley College... And the winner is... Wiley College.
