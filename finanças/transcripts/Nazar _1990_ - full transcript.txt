How thin she looks Even her nose tapered down If only she needn't be cremated But that's impossible No, not mad Just raving Never before such a clear mind Never before, so clear Revolver Nothing broken Just a handful of blood The cabinet where the lamp always burns A corner for the accounts Another room to sleep in A shelf full of books and a safe. The keys... .. I keep - kept. You? What is this? What have you brought? What is this you've brought? They only take gold and silver They won't even talk to me I don't want anything from you either. Perhaps... .. it didn't actually happen like this But it must all have happened... "without thought I had heard everything Shane won't touch it But I'll take it. For you. Advertise in the morning. You're employed by evening Young woman seeks employment Can take care of children Not of any one else... I'm talking about her alone Then it would all have stayed like that - just like that Keep this at home. Leave just the case. I have no room here for Gods. Is it forbidden? No No... But perhaps you would rather not You can keep it No, I won't do that I tell you I won't do that I'll keep this in the cabinet with the others Where the lamp is burning Take two thousand and the deal is done One is enough This stone must have lain with luminous fish in water My condition... ...was as strained as yours But now all that you see around So now you are taking revenge He who wishes the worst for himself Who said that? Does good to others This age is not like that... Stop. I've heard this before... Have you read it? It's possible... Where Mir... Where... An antique dealer is always an antique dealer How strange you are! I didn't think of that at all One person inside another outside One can do good in any walk of life I'm not talking of myself What of evil! I'm incapable of doing anything My gaze... .. always discreet Then why do I feel twisted inside? I haven't changed There's still compassion within me The grocer is on the look-out For a dark, mute creature who can take care of his motherless children. This girl is quiet. Bred in poverty he says He's marrying for the sake of the children. The poor thing is terrified That's when she was raising money for the advertisements I am running a shop. But I want something else I don't speak to anyone I don't stare at faces Yesterday there I was in my shop I know the entire circumstance I have always assessed myself I am assessing myself There is something... .. I want to tell you about Why are you quiet? Wait, I'm thinking She blushed But her eyes were blazing I liked that But by then I was sure. She did come back. To the shop Now it's coming back. Every little details I remember I haven't forgotten As soon as she left I made up my mind I had given Bua some money A bribe! There is for me some work in Goa I am taking her away She has nothing. And wants nothing I'll arrange that Absolutely nothing won't do My childhood wasn't spent in this house. I know Your parents died three years ago There is something I want to say to you Youth is generous... But it has no tolerance Now how do I explain to you what it is to lend money? Perhaps I understand The truth? The truth is... I want you to know me... As I am From the beginning we were both silent There were no quarrels. Just silence She would steal glances at me. I was more silent than ever Yes, I was the one who wanted silence. Not she. It's true. The generosity of youth is splendid But just try a feat of generosity that's hard, quiet and without a flourish... Opens not The door of accord As of now Wounded my desire In orbit spread As of now Have shattered Flint-heart you Someone's fragile heart O bruised heart, in your lane the distant cry As of now Within his cusped palm was my blood So drank off Never in flight Is the henna-stained bird As of now She used to come to sell a few things To raise some money for herself That was at the very beginning I didn't notice her as different from the others As soon as she got her money she turned and walked out Always in silence. Or so it seemed to me They have all left me Forgotten me. That's good How they humiliated me! A shop-keeper! You say it. Everyone says it. So what? That you are a shopkeeper Let them say what they want If somebody.. .. would find a meaning... Whatever they want You can't stop anyone. Anyone at all My understanding is without reason Certain ideas... .. when spoken may sound foolish and inexplicable What ideas? Why should they? Because we are not capable of listening Perhaps even I have not understood But this much is true If you follow a straight path you will reach These small minds! Among ten thousands barely one or two will make it Who started it? No one Why did she, in certain things... .. in sheets, for instance.. .. or in cleanliness..? She didn't realize how her face was swelling No one will believe how closely I observed her I want to get to.. .. the bottom of all this... all this filth Forty equal to seventeen Women have nothing of their own This is to blame for it all I was forty. She seventeen This was on her mind She must have in your eyes... You overvalue things Then argue with me about it These things are not worth so much I speak little but I am firm This money is mine There's no profit from this When I brought you here I made no secret of anything From now on I forbid you... ...to interfere in my work Today she went out first thing in the morning Yesterday too I locked up the shop and came here. But she isn't here either There is an officer - Yamanuj From the same regiment as you He's got something to do with it Yamanuj! He had come to the shop A meeting has been arranged At the home of Julia Samson the colonel's widow You were thrown out of the Army it's true - Why? I refused to eat... You were afraid to fight A summary court-martial gives the verdict The papers are filled from before. Even the judgement During the Mutiny of 1857 the British... For three years after you roamed the streets of Bombay I did not break It has all passed The papers are filled from before. Even the judgement In 1857 the British... White flowers... ...on the bed-sheet She didn't sing very well. she was often out of tune In a muffled tone she sang softly I used to listen standing outside She hides that fact that the sings She knows only this one song She is searching for something. I don't know... I'm not at all quiet or soft-spoken You come too abruptly to the point - very coarsely I'm not sure about that. But I'm certainly disgusted I found what I imagined Did you see that? Not really. I'm quite well You're frail and weak... Face so pale... Lips almost white I am quite, quite well Mir Taqi Mir How shall I know why... My heart is drawn out so From childhood From my childhood By myself On holidays it's as though I have passed years like this Even I... the same You, on your side of the table... I at mine And so it would have remained for years. The same But suddenly I entered Why did I go out? For our tickets... And what a crowd there was there! How they stared at me... The grocer or me? A shop-keeper and a money-lender... ...who could quote a little Mir And I thought it would all remain like that I'll take you to Goa In a little while Your voice is cracked I just heard it I'll close down the shop No, don't say anything I can't rest in any position But I could not have kept quiet That I could be there and not say anything. I was delighted just listening to you You are exaggerating I cannot stop myself I tell you I was so happy... .. there behind the door, hiding... ...listening to you There behind the door My eyes on your feet... .. my ears to your voice Listening to you I was lost in your intelligence... .. and child-like innocence You are killing me I think of you as much greater than me I want to live only with you I could have taken up a job But after being in uniform... I decided... on the antique shop and the money-lending business When I brought you home... I thought I was bringing a friend What is it? What is it? This hand has gone to sleep under the weight of my head Again, today there is an evening Today again there is an evening I probably seem strange to you Nothing wrong The trouble is that I am a dreamer .. with difficulty My indecision every time, on every occasion Whatever happened, happened by chance And there's nothing more terrifying! To perish by chance! For something could have happened... .. if it hadn't... I would have blown by like breeze Had you any hope of survival? My reply, as before God, I had no hope at all Why were you ready to accept death? I ask you. I know it. And you too. If you can guess the truth I was not asleep then Perhaps it didn't actually happen like this But it must have surely happened Even without thinking I myself was about to perish So who could I try to save? But I had heard it all - known it all Before me! She's forgotten me... So she sings Is this the first time? No. She does sing When you are not here She's singing Does she sing? Before me! Weren't you surprised when you heard...? That day in the evening, I lost my courage To you... Please talk Say something to me I see everything, clearly To the last detail My despair. Before you About myself. About you and Bua I am weeping... Why do you say I never see anything? I'll go away.. I can't stay here any longer Cannot sleep. You... Bua, wait! Are you all right? Never mind, you may go What has happened to you? Nothing... You... I was looking at her She turned... .. and then out! It's damp outside! You were here, too
