Hello, Thailand! May, let's say "hi" to everybody! Tell everyone how exciting this birthday trip is! Oh my god, it's so wonderful when I think about it. Why? Because it's the first time Dad doesn't have some guy tailing me. Gucci, Prada, Chanel. Wait for us! Alright, we're not here for that. Oh, well, I know what your purpose is when you come to Bangkok. The trip started with a car crash. What does he want? Money? Go give him some! Go talk with them. Hurry up! Oh my, you understand? That's an insult. Sorry for that. My dinner is done, isn't it? It's special! Careful! Tay? There's only one guy, I'll handle it. Just enjoy it! Hold on! Two people. This guy's not right, is he? Three. But at least, Dong didn't come. Hello, Miss, everything for your trip has been arranged. It's considerably over. Please send back the money they paid us. Don't look at Park's photos so much. We are about to meet the real Park. This is a special gift for your birthday this year. You're so happy that you burst into tears? That's right. It's unbelievable. Because Park hasn't had dinner with anyone like that. But don't worry. No matter how hard it is, it's possible when Dua Hau takes charge. We have three days left to prepare. I don't want to go anymore. What? What's wrong with you? You forgot that we came to Bangkok just to celebrate your birthday with Park? Everything's ready. Then get someone else to take over. How? You don't want to see him again, do you? I want to, but I don't want people to think I'm using money to buy happiness. But, if there was no money, how could we do it? You have to accept the truth. Money can buy everything. But we can't buy feelings with money. That's right, I'll make Park really want to celebrate my birthday with his real feelings. Like that? Are you ready to follow the call of love? Ready. But I have to wear these clothes? Oh, they are all expensive! It's okay to wear casual clothes. Get me something else. Where do we buy things in Bangkok? Well, you mean you want to wear Platinum's hi-end fashion? That's easy. Hey, how do we deter those guards? We can handle normal people. But Dong is difficult to run away from. I guess Nanny told them to come. Dua Hau! Why don't you say something? Dua Hau, why are you not saying anything? Dua Hau… Nanny… Why is your mother here? Why are you here? Why can't I be here? Your father told me to come here and take care of you. Because four bodyguards might not be enough. Four people are not enough? Didn't you want me to come? It's not that. I have no problems to worry about when you are with us. Problems? No. It's just something I said. Nothing happened. Are you sure? Sure. Do you want me to take care of you? Yes. You've been like a mother to me since I was little. It's great to have you with us. Cheer, cheer. Why didn't you tell me? This outfit is good. What is it? Calm down, we'll visit only one temple. Today we are on a nine-temple tour. Nine temples! Ladies and gentlemen, when Thai people come to temple, they pray for peace, health for their families. The main hall in Thai temples is designed with a door at each corner. The two front doors are for people. The two back doors are for monks and nuns. Back door. May, your birthday is soon, right? So now you're going to pray for a blessing. No, for what? You must do it. Well, the light in this sanctuary will lead you to happiness. Your wishes will become real. So, please, allow me to have a little blessing. Great, come on. Mom. People say that the blessings should not be disturbed. So let May go alone. No one's bothering you. Everybody will go inside and will be very quiet. Well, it's very quiet in the hall. So if too many people go inside just your breath will let the monks know how fat you are. See, so everybody please wait outside. I'm going with May by myself. Boy, you made new decor for your side mirror? The new pattern on the helmet is so beautiful too. It's not a new pattern, I just crashed yesterday. Crashed? Anything broken? No. Broken? I'm okay. Just kidding, good to see you're fine. Did he take responsibility? I did not ask but he gave me his name card. He said call him and tell him how much I want. You met a rich guy, call him and ask for money, hurry up. One million Thai baht. No I don't want to, it's a waste of time. Are you stupid? Calm down. Must be really calm. There's a monk. Calm down, go in. What are we going to do next? First, we have to check where Park is now. Look. Let me check: is it far from here? Buddha loves us. Park is not far from here. Who's that? The motorcycle guy from yesterday. What did he say? He said he's very busy. I think he broke the promise. Let me talk to him. This number? Yes. This guy has to talk with me. You don't know the drill. How much will you give my friend? Hey… That's not okay. It's okay. What did he say? I don't understand. Act like you can understand. Just for fun, no biggie. Hello. Where's May? The monk is focusing on the blessing. Okay. Where's the mistress? Oh my god, let me tell you something. The monk is unbelievable. When May and I went in. The monk knew that May's birthday is coming up. Then he said May was having bad luck. The monk decided to do a ceremony for her to get rid of bad luck. You haven't heard of it? Anti-bad luck ceremony. Very fast. It takes about 45 minutes. Forty-five minutes. But during the ceremony, no one can interrupt. Because if we do, it will be broken. And May's bad luck will double. It's very bad luck. You are just so full of bullshit. Is this the right place? Why are there no production crews? It's really here. There must be a mistake. Hello, what's up? Oh, no. That's right, it's that bar. But I'm not in Saigon. You guys go first. We will go together when I get back next week. Okay. Hello. Really? Okay, go. It's been 17 minutes since Dua Hau came out. Where are you going? I'm going inside to see how the monk works. You can't. I told you, the monk is doing the ceremony. If we interrupt, the bad fortune will double. Who takes responsibility? Don't you remember, the tour guide told us, it is very quiet in there. Just the slightest breath can startle the monk. Right? Don't know if that is "he" or "she." Right? I'm your subordinate? Obsessive star follower. Found it. Here. I'm confused or she is? Ayuthaya is very far. What now? Everybody, now we really need to get on the bus to get to the next stop. Or we will get stuck in Bangkok traffic. This way, please. Wait, I'm going to call the mistress. Don't go, please. God, what are you doing? Didn't you hear what the guide said? But the monk told me that we can't interrupt. It's three minutes late. Now forty-eight minutes have passed. Right, Bac is right. So let me come with you. Stand here! I'll go on my own. Why is your hair so messy? No, it isn't. Just because I bowed a lot. Oh, my god, poor you. Alright, it's okay. Well, excuse me. The tour rule is not to overstay for more than five minutes. Let's go. I'll solve it. Let's go. Park is very handsome, isn't he? I didn't meet him. Why? The ceremony here was good. You feel better, don't you? Great. I'll tell you later on. Now you go pay him the money. He's waiting outside, it's 500 dollars. 500 dollars? What's up? I want to pee. You guys go first, I will catch up. I bought this for you. Thank you so much, Boy. I need to go to check on my grandma. Okay. Chris! Haven't got any guys lately? Yong! Call me Christy. Understood? Last but not least, it's not like I don't get guys. This can be a guarantee, food from a guy. Boy bought a lot stuff, and gave some to me. Really? Boy? Yes. Better to go to find something free to eat. I'm going P'Christy… Sak. Crazy asshole. If you weren't my relative, I would fire you. Grandma, I'm back. Grandma, I'm back too. Hello, Uncle and Aunty. Can I have dinner with you today? Hello, ancestors. Boy. Grandma… You scared me. Out of nowhere. Was that Pim? Yes, she is coming. Grandma, you have dinner first. Just ignore him. Boy? Grandma, let's go to eat. Are you hungry? Sit here, be careful. Look at this food. How much did you earn today? 500. 500? I think this is two or three times that already. Dollars. 500 dollars. Dollars? One dollar equals 30… Oh, Boy, you've got 20,000 Thai baht? Did you fail math? It's 15,000 Thai baht. Yes, almost. Hoi jo is Yong's favorite. Go wash your hands first. You forget my grandma doesn't like it. Go wash your hands before eating. Grandma, can I get one bit, please? Okay, wash hands first. Bring the rice over too. How is your mom? When will she come back? She is fine. Let's eat, Grandma, I bought your favorite. Eat as much as you can, so mom can't blame me. The rice is here. You are good at taking care of Grandma. You berated her. But she still gave you that much? Do you know… that she came to Thailand to meet her idol? What? Spoiled fangirl. Is she beautiful? I think she is very much a kid. That is my type. You are always like that. How can I meet this kind of girl? You have to learn English first. It's fine. Okay? Okay. Are you kidding me? You know I don't like to study. When will you go back to school? If I go back to school, who will take care of Grandma? When will you tell Grandma the truth about your mom? I don't know. If your parents were still alive, you probably would have been graduated and then become a photographer. I will definitely go back to school. When everything settles down. I hope you can soon. Damn it. May, I'm sorry. I thought it was near but it's not. I have something for you. You sure can't be mad at me anymore. See? Finally we have a chance. Hello? What ring? I didn't have cash. I used my ring as a deposit. If your parents find out, they will kill me. Why don't you give "me" to them? Who wants you? Hello. Are you ready? Are you okay? Robber! That guy! Robber! Oh my god! - Oh, my! Robbery! - What! - What? - Mom, it was a robber, wasn't it? Robber! Oh my god! Where is May? May, she was just sitting here. May! Find her, now! Just a lousy bag. Why are they chasing me like that? Here, take it back. Excuse me, make way! Police… What does this have to do with the police? She wants the police to arrest you. Arrest me? Jail. Damn it. Bro… Tell her someone asked me to do that. Snatch her bag. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Who hired you? I don't know him. My friend told me he is a ladyboy. He looks like a girl. Do you have anything to say? Where are you going? My job here is done. Done? Mine too? Thank you very much. I almost died… All of you leave. Why are you doing this? I've been working for this family for 20 years. He trusts me, just like I trust you. You trust me, then why don't you let me take care of May? Why do those people have to follow? May is not a child anymore. She should be able to explore the world. No need to tail her everywhere. Even with me here, something like that can happen. Then what if I wasn't? But is that called trust? I taught you everything because I want you to take over my job. Please don't use me as your purpose. You just do it for yourself. You want to live in a rich family. An easy job with high pay. I love May because she's like me. Having parents that are only good at making money. Forget even their own children. Maybe to you, I am a selfish person. Because I don't let you live how you want. But I did all that because I love you. I care for you. I want you to be happy. All right! You disobeyed me today. But we'll leave it for now. More on that later. But now… You want everyone not to follow May, right? Then you will be the first to stay away from her. Right now, back to the hotel! Pack your things and fly back to Vietnam. Hello, this is free gift. Welcome. Park. Welcome. Sorry, you cannot enter. It's only for those who have a ticket. How much is a ticket? Right now the only way to get ticket is playing the game over there. There. We know that the tickets sold out unexpectedly. Come this way. Many fans are waiting to get inside. But we have a special game for special winners to get a ticket to go inside. Our game is 'Ring throwing to find Park'. So we will give one ring to each person. Only one chance to throw. If you can throw the ring onto Park's finger like this, you will get a ticket. But we only have three tickets left. Three tickets. Please stand in a row. Good luck, everybody. Thank you all Park's FC. Today Park's meeting is a small but a very warm one. Warm welcome to new members who came to join us. Also welcome to our old fans. Hello. Grandma, please eat something and have your medicine before you go to bed. I already ate. That was lunch. I bought Kuoy Jab for dinner, your favorite food. Pim. You are back? Are you tired? Grandma. Mom's very tired, so let her take a rest. Boy, take a photo for me and your mom. Boy, do you want a photo with your mom? I'll take it. Can you, Grandma? Beautiful. I sent Dua Hau back to Vietnam. Please let me be his mother. Well, you're probably tired today. You should take a rest. We have a sightseeing tour tomorrow. I hope it will be fine. Because if not, I would need to hand everything back to your father. Sis! I'm sorry. You're in trouble because of me. Every time something happens, you're the one who protects me. Luckily, May is safe. We're dead otherwise. I find it getting worse and worse. But what was Dua Hau thinking? Maybe of a special birthday for May. So much that he forgot the important mission? Why do you look so serious? Well… Cheers. My god, are we having fun or what? No more work chit chat, please. Cheers! I've been working here for quite some time. - Again? - So I understand what the nanny is doing. Do you know what's most important? What? The safety of everyone in this family is the most important thing. Yes, sir. Exactly. But you should remember one thing. Being human, everyone has the urge to "pursue happiness." Dua Hau is just helping her. But here's the thing, to support May to that extent is reckless. Too reckless. Don't forget who we are. We're just bodyguards. Now I want to ask. You… If May was in danger, what would you do? Yes, sir! May's safety must be put at the… the top. You're right, Bac. If we don't have the guts to take risk, we'll never get what we want. Nanny. Our tour guide called in sick unexpectedly. So we're going to have a substitute. But he can't speak Vietnamese. I will go back to Saigon. Let's smile, smile up. Are you hungry? Yes, I am God, let's get some Thai massage. Let's eat quickly and go. Dear, eat. It's the newest. The newest. You want to play? Looks interesting. Park's here, please standby. Boy, Park's here. It's Park. Wow, he looks handsome. Handsome, huh? Park. Yong. My grandma is missing. What? Boy. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma! Sorry. Did you see this lady? No? Oh my god, this must be May's plan. Don't worry, we'll find her. Nanny! I can't find her. Did you see her? She's gone. Oh, my god! This is a video on the internet. That's our tour guide. Oh, my god, what will we do? I think you should go back to the hotel. Nam, you take Nanny back to the hotel. Bac and Tay, follow me to find May. Okay. Pa Neng. Did you see Boy's grandma? I saw her walk in that direction. Damn it! Hello. Boy. A lady said your grandma was walking towards the shrine. Okay. I have been to the shrine but cannot find Grandma. Okay. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Boy, where have you been? Let's go home, Grandma. Boy. How's your grandma? She's fine, thank you for helping me to find her. - I have to go. - Hey! Boy, where are you going? Hello. Where are you going, handsome guys? I will take you for free. Do you know who they are? Speak English. Boy. Yong. Do you know these three guys? They still can't find May. I booked a car to the airport. Once we find her, we'll fly back to Saigon immediately. Thank you. Tell me. What did you do to make those bodyguards come here? Nothing. How come Boy was with that girl? Well… Can you tell them, if we can contact Boy we will let them know. You're sure? I'm sure. But why me? Hurry up, they're looking at us. Do you understand? Nam's just called. Nanny wants us back at the hotel. But, we haven't found the mistress. Is he going to punch me? We have to do like she said. Let me check around once more. - Bac. - What? Call Nam. Tell him we'll be back when we find her. Yes. Hello. My son, before things get worse. I think you should tell your guy that he's doing it wrong. You don't believe me. It's okay. But I believe that you know May better than anyone. May isn't wrong to pursue her happiness. You taught me… happiness is simply doing what you like and seeing the one you love. Right, mom? Right there. Hello! Hello! Stupid person. Stupid person. Stupid person. You're adorable! You're adorable! I like you. I like you. May, I like you. I like you, too. I covered my face, good. This one is better. Ma'am. Our flight's waiting at the airport. We have to buy new tickets because the previous flight has just taken off. As soon as we find May, we're going to the airport. I hope we won't all be fired. I have just started work here. Nanny. Dua Hau… Mistress. He gave this to you. Hi, look at me? You are so cute. The girl on the left is so cute. Stick your eyes on her. You hit on all the girls you meet. Why blame me? You're the one who forget a crucial thing on the first day of school. Here. Thanks. I will pay for your dinner. You promise? Okay. I have to go now or Mr. Christy Sak will be a pain. Wait. Hello. Boy. What? Stop with the phone. Hang up. Look. Yong, may I borrow your motorbike? Okay. Please take my camera back as well. Boy. Boy. How can I go back? My motorbike is parked at the back. You can go and take it. Boy, you left me again, bad friend. I like you. Hi. No. You can speak Thai? Just a little bit. Surprise… Your hair seems shorter. I had it cut. Cut? Haircut. Yes. Haircut. Congratulations. Grown up into a girl. You guys see. This is the first time he buttons up the shirt. Oh gosh! Cheers! Cheers! This time… This time May will be free, so we can let our hair down.
