This frightening ordeal comes to a close today as the serial killer known only as Lone Wolf, has been confirmed dead. Local law enforcement suspects he's responsible for the imprisonment and murder of multiple people in a demented attempt to turn them and himself into human furries. Reports say after abducting and caging his victims, he would force feed them raw animal meat using their hides to sew pelts onto himself and his victims. Thankfully, this has been an isolated incident, as there is no record of violent incidents occurring at other furry themed parties. Officials warn of backlash copy cat killers and advise caution. Witnesses report they've never seen a more horrific scene. Coverage on this crime continues as more reports come in. This is Sandra Summers with Action 8 News reporting live. You doing all right? I'm fine. I'm Just trying to make sense of everything that happened. I'm so glad you could make it to the party. I wouldn't miss this for the world. Sue, you look beautiful. Leon, you're so sweet. What does she see in this guy? He's a mascot and he's a fucking nerd. Doesn't even play football. He's such a tool. You did such a great job tonight. You really got the crowd pumped. You know Sue, I'd do anything for you. Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. I wove you, too! Gonna light his ass on fire. 911, what's the nature of your emergency? How did this happen? I don't know. Damn, this mascot is fried. Yeah, I know. These college kids think everything's a joke. Let's get out of here. Hello? Doctor, the man that was burned has escaped. What?

Please, help! Help! Okay, Hanna, you are smart, you are beautiful, and all of the boys love you. Especially Johnny. Where are you going, young lady, I made you breakfast? Mom, the girls are coming. I don't have time for breakfast. What are you doing with that silly getup on? I told you. Today I'm going to Furry Fest. Charlie, I really don't think you should go to this thing. There's no way I'm not going to this. There are a lot of creeps out there. It could be dangerous. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. This is about Rebecca. Why do you have to do this to me? Ever since Rebecca disappeared, you won't let me live my own life. Charlie, you are the most important person in my life. I can't imagine something happening to you, like what happened to your sister. I would die. This isn't about me. This is about you and your fear of being alone. I'll be okay. And of course, I'll always be here, but, you also have to let me be me. I love you. I love you, too. You're the smartest cheetah I know. But please promise me you'll be safe. Go. Have fun at your crazy Furry Fest. Thanks, mom. I'll call you when I get there, okay? Love you. Bye! Looking good, Charleeta. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, you guys excited? - Oh, hell yeah. - Yes, so pumped. We've been waiting for you forever, God. Sorry. Get your butt in here and let's go. We gotta go pick up Valentina. Yeah, come on. Okay, does she have to stop back at her dorm room to change? No, she wore her fur suit to class. Okay. Periodic table is made up of some basic elements. Due keep in mind, solids, liquids, and gases. So keep in mind, it isn't rocket science, although some of you may become rocket scientists, work at NASA on the next couple years. But for now let's focus on the basic periodic table. As we do have a quiz on that coming up. Solids do have a definite shape. Oh shit, he's looking. Miss Valentina, can you please share what is so amusing about our periodic table today. Um, nothing sir, I just had the anti gold medals. What tickles me is this outfit, get up thing you got going on. What are you supposed to be anyways? Halloween is over, you know. Uh, that's for another class. All right. Solids. Speaking of another class, that is time, ladies and gentlemen. Please keep in mind we do have a quiz on Monday, so know your periodic table. Miss Valentina, have a good weekend. Guys, I am so excited for this Fur Fest. Like, it's gonna be so lit. True, I hope we see Tyrone there. Last year, I think I saw him making eyes at me. Gabby, he's in a fur suit. How could you possibly know that he's making eyes at you? I mean, he was looking in my direction. Besides, sometimes you just know. Anyways, do you guys wanna check out his latest YouTube video? Yeah, sure, why not? All right, let me pull it up. Oh God, these are Tyrone? He's gonna be at my party tomorrow. Wait, you know Tyrone? Of course. We follow each other on Instagram. Wow. Wow. Aren't you popular. Also, you looking fly as hell, girlfriend. I didn't get you. Okay. Girls, don't forget the bucket for tomorrow. You should go there tonight. Yeah, speaking of, are you 100% sure that Tyrone's really gonna be there. Of course, all the popular Furries are gonna be there. That's why you should be there. And if you come there tonight, we can have a girls talk and have all day to get ready. I mean, that sounds good to me. - That sounds awesome. - Yeah. Okay guys, ready to get your fur on? So ready. - Let's go. - Let's go. Oh my God, kids, Tyrone's gonna be on stage, come on! What happened, Charlie? We need to get some air, come with me. Hey, Valentina. Ladies, let me introduce you to my friend, Damien. Hi, I'm Charlie. Yeah, hey, what's up? You should know, I'm only here ironically. What? I'm only here for this lame scene. Normally, I wouldn't indulge these fringy cultures, and quite frankly, I think it's kind of pathetic to dress up like a freaking animal. But, I owed my brother one, and he forgot his stupid gloves, so here I am. Oh my God, you have to come see this girl dancing at the bar. Wait, where's Hanna? - Oh. - Oh shit. No no no no no no. Whoa. What's up, come join me, huh. Uh, not today. Come on, get down from there. Okay, okay. I want company, feel me lift you. Okay, yeah. All right, okay, yup, I get that you're a possum, but we're not doing that today. Oh, why not? Seriously. So Damien, Valentina says your brother's a furry? What's his name? Tyrone. You mean like Tyrone the Tiger? Yeah, he dresses up like a tiger. Oh my God. Do you know him or something? Well, I'm only his biggest fan. I mean, have you seen his YouTube channel? Oh my God. Speaking of captain fancy pants, here he comes now. What? Charlie, I don't feel so good. Oh, oh you got me! Yes, that was epic! You two, puppy dog and the gato, you gotta go. I'm not a gato, I'm a cheetah. All right, cheetah, your friend here is very drunk. So take the drunk puppy, skinny jeans, and get outta here. Guys, meet me at my dad's lake house. Damien's been there. He knows where it is at. Yeah. Okay, come on. Man, I cannot believe we just got kicked out of the Fur Con. Yeah, all thanks to Hanna, my chances with Tyrone are completely ruined. Shut up, Gabby babby. It's fine, it's not a big deal. Calm down? My life is over. He probably hates me now. He's probably fugly as hell anyways. Well, I wouldn't necessarily use the word ugly. I mean, he's definitely a douche. And I'm the one who has to live with him. Yeah, I guess douchiness runs in the family. What are you even still doing here? I do know where the party is, so if Gabby does want to meet him, you could. Yeah, whatever. Can we just go home? Why do you even care about Gabby and Tyrone anyway, huh? You don't even like your brother. I would love to see the look on his face when Hanna shows up at the party. You're pretty funny. At least you're honest. Okay, you two in the car, girl talk. You, stay out here. I think we should totally go to the party. Sit back, Hanna. Gabby, what do you think? Let's just get outta here and go home, okay? Oh my God, can we at least talk about it? Um, I think that we're in this mess because of you, so I'm more interested in hearing what Gabby has to say. I just want to leave. I lost my chance. Well, okay I know this sucks, but I, I don't think you lost your chance completely. I mean, like I said, Hanna's the one that puked on him, not you. And you guys were dancing earlier, so maybe if we go there could still be a chance. But, the only thing is, we just met this guy. Like we don't even know him. Can we really trust him to bring us to the party? You can totally trust me. Are you listening? Only slightly. Back away from the car. This is a private conversation. I don't know, what if he gets us lost? Or worse, what if he just brings us somewhere else entirely? I don't know if that's a risk that we should take. Not even for Gabby? Oh, simmer down. We're not even talking about Gabby, we're talking about Damien. He's hot. And that means that we should trust him? No but, Valentina said we could, so. That's true, he is Valentina's friend. God, I hate when you have a good point. You're drunk, you're not supposed to have a point. Okay, Gabby, I'm good to go if you are, so it's up to you. Do you want to go to this party, try again? Yeah, fuck it, let's just do it. You're right. I'm not even the one that puked on him. Woo, now that is the spirit, girlfriend. Yes! Really? Still listening? Gabby, this is gonna be the best night of your life. Yes, and oh my God. All you ever talk about is, Tyrone, boop boopy do. Now what do you say girl, huh? You wanna, you wanna go show these crash animals how to party? Oh my God. Yeah, I guess that settles that. Okay, uh, I'm gonna go deal with him. Okay, if you're gonna come with us, I'm gonna give you some ground rules. One, keep your hands to yourself. Two, any bullshit and I leave you to rot out in the desert. Okay, agreed. - Got it? - Of course. Okay, get in the car. Man, this sucks. There's probably gonna be like tons of dancing and partying and I'm not gonna be able to even join it. What, why not? Dude, I like broke my butt when I fell over, like. Oh my God. Well, I don't think a broken butt has ever stopped you before, so. I think once we get you on that dance floor you'll be just fine. Also, you're gonna have so much fun setting Gabby up with Tyrone. No, I don't want her anywhere near me and Tyrone ever again. Dude, his persona is so hot. Gabby, you're gonna gif him. Shut up. Well if you don't want to, I certainly will. What's giffing? You know, giffing. To bark like a fox. Do the do. Traffic between body parts, you know? Have sex. What do you even see in him? He's such a tool. I have way more views on my blog than that fur bag. Oh yeah, how many? Somewhere around like uh, 80,000. - Wow, that's pretty high. - Yeah. Now let me see your abs, huh? Jesus, get a room. Hanna, look at who you're talking to. This boy does not have abs. Aw. So, Damien, if you didn't go to the Con to suit up, then what were you there for, huh? Well, I figured it was an effective way to get laid. Oh. There it is, typical man. So Hanna, you wanna Netlix and chill some time? Well, I mean, I don't know, maybe. What kind of movies do you like? Like, "Psycho," "Scream," "Friday the 13th," and "Halloween." Stuff like that. You know, Damien, I don't like you, but I gotta say, your taste in movies isn't half bad. What's "Psycho?" What, Hanna, are you serious? - Yeah. - Oh my God. You've never seen "Psycho?" That's like a classic. It's like one of the best horror films ever made. You've heard of Alfred Hitchcock, right? Alfred Witchcock? Oh my God. Alfred Hitchcock, the guy that did the cooking show in the 80s, right? Cooking show, are you serious? You guys, both of you. What? No, he's like one of the best directors of all time. He basically invented like horror, suspense, slasher films. Films like "Scream," "Friday the 13th," and "Halloween" all pay homage to "Psycho." Yes. They would never have been made without it. Exactly. Actually Damien, you kind of remind me of an Alfred Hitchcock character. You know, Norman Bates. Ah, ha ha, very funny. So, Damien, tell me more about your brother. Why do you want to know? He's a tool. Like, I mean, what does he sleep in? What kind of girls is he into? Well he doesn't, you know, like. Charlie. What's up? - Oh God. - No no no. Hanna, do not puke in this car. Hanna. Hanna, do not puke in this car. - It's my car. - I know, and right now I am the one driving it, so just relax, okay? Hey, sit back, okay? Just go. Just drink some water and chill. Just take a nap, okay? I'll wake you up when we get there. I'm pretty sure I just saw a sign for a gas station, so maybe it's up ahead over here. Okay, I could really use an energy drink. Yeah, me too. I'll pull off the next exit. Okay. Guys, this place looks pretty sketch. Gabby, I don't care. I have to pee so bad. Honestly, this looks like a place to get murdered. Can you maybe no walk so close to me? What you need? Um hi, we just, can we get the key to the bathroom? You could. So, could we? The crapper is for paying customers, young lady. Should we just go? No. - I have to pee so bad. - No no no. We'll get four shots of cinch whisker's please. Sure, oh. Make that three. I'm not, I'm driving. I meant four, two were for me. All right, these are called panty droppers around here. Here you go, your four and I'll have one, too. Why don't you put those on my tab, sister Mary. Oh, what tab would that be? That would be no tab, because this ain't sacramental wine, and the abbey ain't picking up your tab. You gotta pay for your firewater around here, padre. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Yeah, sure. - Cheers. Could we get that key. Yeah, sure. Here you go, just follow the smell. Can you go with Hanna, make sure she doesn't fall in? I'll be fine. How bout a burger over here. You got it. Hey, Tony! Tony, hey Tony! What? Yeah, my friend's getting a little hangry out here. We need one of them disaster burgers. Let's get that fired up, huh? You hear me, boy? Fine! Hey, skinny jeans. Hello, ma'am. Kinda silky, wanna dance? Um, oh, no uh. Um like, salsa dancing? Horale, get your own lady, ese. That's, that's done. Not to worry, guys. They do it all the time. No, I'm, I'm very worried. Oh no, governors coming, oh oh! Hey Tony, Tony! What? Flaming hot burger on the plate, enjoy. God damn, that disaster. Holy hell, Mary, best damn burger in town. Cheers to that, honey. Kind of bunch of freaks. Hey Mary, let me get two tequilas. It was an adventure. Yeah, you could say that. Uh, can you guys take your shots so we can leave? - Yes. - Yeah. Okay. Great, let's go. Well how would you ladies like to join me for another round? - No. - No. We're actually just. We would love another drink. Excellent. Sister Mary, load us up with another one. - Hanna. - Free drinks, guys. Free drinks. All right, shall we? Oh, I was. Damien, what are you doing? Can you just sit down already? I can't remember ever seeing any furries around here before? That's 'cause we've never been here before. But, you know, we were just passing through and we were wondering what you, what y'all do for fun around here, 'cause. Well, I was just officiating a wedding the other day. Let me tell ya something, the after party was pretty fantastic. Oh my God, I love parties. Imagine that, so do I. Oh my God, really? But like, just so you know, we're on our way to one right now. - No. - Well count me in. Really no. No, I don't think so, actually. She doesn't know what she's talking about. Yes I do. Are you even really a priest? Well, it's complicated. I'll figure it out. Cheers to that! No no no no no no. Damien. You'd better not be about to do what I think you're about to do. What do you think these people are going to do if you spit their whiskey onto their floor? Swallow it. Can I get a water for my friend. Or maybe just another round. - Really? - No. A water would be better than anything else. Please, definitely water. All right, your wish is my fricking command. You got a fur ball? You all right there? My throat's on fire. Firewater for us. All right, another round. Thank you. It'll settle your little tummy. I'm gonna step outside for a second. Are you okay? Yeah, no, I'm fine. I just, I realized I forgot to call my mom. - Horale, heina. - Oh God. That's a nice tail you got there. Hey sweetie, how's the furry thing going? It's going all right. I just wanted to let you know that we're actually leaving to go to Valentina's cabin for the weekend. Charlie, you sound worried. Are you sure everything is okay? Yeah mom, everything's fine. I know we talked about it earlier, but I just have a bad feeling. Maybe you should just come home. No mom, I'm not coming home right now. I've been waiting for this weekend for months. Charlie please, I beg you, just please come home. Please just trust me. I'm safe, I'm with my friends. I'll be home Sunday. I'll talk to you later, okay. Gotta go. Charlie no, please wait, I I, there's something I need to tell you. Bye. You guys are so funny. Let's do a toast, shall we? Absolutely not. Well just the ladies then. All right, here's to the fire. Not the fire that burns down shacks and shanty's, but to the fire that burns down pants and panties. What? I'm glad it looks like you guys are finishing up 'cause I really, really think we should go. Come on, Charlie, just one more. Just one more, Charlie. How bout no more. Ah, just one for us then. You done? Hanna. Shit. Is everything okay, Charlie? No, it's not okay. The car won't start. - What? - You gotta be kidding me. I can't imagine spending another minute in this absolute shit hole. - Anybody a mechanic. - Uh-uh. I barely passed my drivers test. I don't even have my license. What? Creeper. Y'all are shit outta luck. Jimmy the Gator doesn't. But I do have good news for you. One of our guests OD'd, passed out right on the shitter. - He didn't even use it. - Oh God. You have any others? Sweet cakes, you can bunk with me. Um, you know that's offensive, right? Get back. I wouldn't bother you, sweet cheeks. Where is it? Is it just down this hallway? Thanks. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Why don't we put this down over here? Um, yeah, okay. I think we should just all go to bed. It's been a really long day. The sooner we go to bed, the sooner we can leave here tomorrow. God damn son, you smell like shit. What's the matter boy, cat got your tongue? Well, here's your problem right here. Somebody disconnected your battery wire. Say, you look awfully familiar. You ever been around these parts before? No, never. Can you fix this battery thing? Oh yeah, sure. It'll only take a minute. Okay, great. Can you do that then? Thank you. Okay, hey guys. Okay, so he said it's a really quick fix, so we're gonna get in the car and go. - Super. - Okay? You sure you never been in this parts before? 'Cause I swear, last year someone just like you came into this area. I'm pretty sure I would remember being here and meeting you. Okay, well be careful. That road up ahead, that's gonna be quite dangerous. Thank you. We will be very careful. Thanks. Hey, where's my bobblehead? What, what are you talking about? My bobblehead that was on the dashboard. Yeah look, it's gone. Uh, I don't know, maybe it's on the floor. Yeah, could you take a look? I don't see it anywhere down here. I don't know, man. Maybe the creepy mechanic guy took it. What was that guy saying before we left? Yeah. Something about how I looked familiar. Like he'd seen me before. He was probably just flirting with you 'cause he thought you were cute. Ew. All right, ladies, let's go get our fur on. Guys, how do you like the party? - Awesome, yeah. - It's so lit, dude. You really know how to throw a party. What happened to you guys last night? It's a really long story. I don't think we really want to talk about it, but we're really excited to be here. Guys, let me introduce you to my friend, Catalina. She's another exchange student from Mexico. I've always wanted to meet an American hipster. I can be your guy. That's Damien. Hey, Charlie. I don't really know if I'm gonna drink anything. Dude, why not? Literally you've been acting so weird since we left the gas station. Like, did something happen? I don't know. I mean nothing really happened but, I just couldn't shake this feeling that something was going to happen. It was like, God this is gonna sound so weird, but I feel like I saw someone in like a wolf costume like following us. Charlie, literally everybody here. I know, but it wasn't like a normal fur suit. It was like, I don't know, like it was made out of real wolf fur, or road kill or something. I don't know, maybe I just, tripped out. And my mom's paranoid as hell to me. That's maybe a thing. Whatever, I guess I should have this drink. Yes you should, you need it. Come on, let's go back to the party. So, this is happening. Yeah, this is like a dream come true. Here, let me make this easier. No no no, wait. What's wrong? Damien? No, it's me, Tyrone. Damien and I are twins. I don't understand. Look, basically, I was attracted to your persona. I identify as asexual, binary, and very very gay. So this, doesn't work for me. Are you fucking blind? My fur suit is clearly female. I don't care what you identify as, because obviously you're just as shitty as the rest of the men in this fucking world. My persona is very straight, okay? Straight baby, straight like an arrow, okay? Really? That's all you have to say right now? Yeah. God, Damien was right about you. Get the fuck outta my way. Hey, are you okay? No, I don't want to talk about it. Told you my brother's a dick. Shut up. Damn bro, you scared the shit outta me. You really can't walk in on people like that. That is single-handedly the worst fur suit I have ever seen. You just make that out of roadkill? 'Cause damn bro, you smell. I've heard of furries like you. They get all caught up in their, personas. I like that. Valentina, where's your restroom? Upstairs. Sorry it didn't work out. It's fine, it's whatever. Let's just get lit. Let's go dance. Okay, come on. It's way worse inside. You're okay. Sheriff, we thought we had ourselves a regular slaughterhouse here. When we first arrived on scene, we thought it was a couple poachers or something skinning a bunch of animals. We realized it was people when Deputy Carpenter picked up one of those fur head helmets and a head just fell out. Spun around on the floor and looked right at him. Spooked him real bad. Sheriff, we got ourselves a couple of witnesses. Some kids at the party positively ID'd the killer. You want to talk to them? You bet I do. Guys, what we got here is a bonafide cereal killer. Better get yourselves some strong coffee, 'cause we're gonna be up all night. Charlie, that thing took her. Well, well, we'll find her. We're gonna talk to the Sheriff now. We're gonna get her back. Please tell Sheriff exactly what you just told me. You two oughta be happy, you oughta be happy that you're still alive. I need to know what happened here. The killer was in some kind of wolf suit. He killed everybody. And then he took our friend, Charlie. You're telling me he kidnapped a girl? Yes and, oh God. So at the party she said that somebody was following us, and he was maybe waiting for the right time to take her. Hold on, what direction did they go? You need to tell me that. I need to know. I know, left, right, west? Listen, we're gonna send some officers out right now, but we're low on manpower. We're gonna have to call state police to help with the search and rescue. We don't have time for that shit. He's gonna fucking kill her. Calm down. If he took her, he wants her alive. We're gonna put together a search and rescue party. We're gonna make it happen, but we need to get backup. I suggest you two go to the hospital and get checked out. We're gonna take care of the rest, you understand? Once the search and rescue's out, she's our first priority. It's all right, Hanna. Scruggs, come here. Yes, Sheriff. Make sure you contact the kidnapped girl's mom. Let her know the situation. Let her know search is on the way. And you're gonna have to get an all points bulletin out that there's a serial killer in a wolf costume. You understand? - Yes, Sheriff. - All right, do it. Sheriff! Your kids are contaminating the crime scene, again. Hey, hey put that head down! Put those heads down! Put those heads. We have to find Charlie. We don't have much time. Stop, Charlie, stop. Charlie. - No, it's not real. - I've missed you so much. Charlie. No no no, no no no. Get it together. That's not her, you're just imaging it. It's not really her. Choey, your given name is Choey. Who else would know that but your little sis? My God. I'm so sorry. You've been here all this time? Take your fur hat off, I want to see you. It hurts so much. He sewed it onto you? He wants me to be like him. Bastard! We have to get out of here! We have to find a way to get out of here. You don't think I've tried? We can take him. I've learned the less you fight, the less it hurt. Becca, come on, help me. You. Get away from her. He's trying to take care of me. Are you okay? I guess. I'm so sorry. Hello? Hello, Mrs Chan. I'm with the Sheriff's Office. I regret to inform you. No no no, no. Mrs Chan, Mrs Chan, your daughter Charlie was a party and has been kidnapped. She is currently missing. I just wanted to let you know we're sending a police cruiser over to pick you up and take you to the station. Oh, okay. He disappears for about two hours or so to hunt. We can't wait until tomorrow. We have to get out of here tonight. There's no way we will be able to escape. We'll make a way. Does he have anyone else captive? No, it's always been just me. I just don't understand. How did this happen? I was driving back to school and stopped at a creepy truck stop to get gas. I went inside for a moment and when I got back to the car it wouldn't start. Then I think I was hit on the head. The next thing I remember is I was here, stuck in this awful place. Why'd he have to pick you? He must have like my fur suit. He thinks he's a real wolf. He hunts, he howls on full moons, it's the weirdest shit ever. He's full on psychotic and he wants me to join him. No, we are getting here. We are going home. Even if it means killing the son of a bitch. Charlie, Charlie! Charlie! We were just stupid. I should have helped. Anyone's to blame, it's me. I'm the one who got us into this fucking mess. You know, today was supposed to be the best night of her life, and I fucked it up like I fuck everything else up. I haven't been a very good friend. Charlie's strong. She wouldn't go down without a fight. Get that shit away from me! Ah! No, please. Please, it's too soon. She just got here. What are you talking about? Becca? Becca, what are you talking about? It'll be over soon. What will be over soon? What did he say? What's happening? Charlie, this is, this is all my fault. I'm so sorry. I, I told him about you, about your friends. About how you look like me. What? I, I didn't think he would do it. You told him about me? I just wanted to see my sister again. Get off me! No, stop. His name is Leon. He wants a family. What's he gonna do to me? He's going to make you a furry like us. No, get off of me. No, stop. No, stop. Help, somebody help! Help, I'm over here! Okay. Becca, we have to get out of here, right now. Shit, where's the key? Don't do this. This is real, we'll be lost. You are only going to make him angry. No no no no. We're not animals, we don't belong in cages. - Leon! - Where's the key? - Leon! - No. Leon! Come on. No. Wait, come on. Listen to me. We have to go home, okay? Don't you want to see mom again? Mom loves you, I love you. We both love you so much. Please come home, okay? Okay. No, no. Get away from me. Don't touch me. Leave her alone! Charlie, go! Get out! Mom. I'm so sorry. Becca. Where is she? Is she okay? She's healing in intensive care. But she is safe. You are safe. We are a family again. Is he dead? Who? The man, in the wolf costume. The one that took me and Becca. I don't know. All I know is that you are safe now and our family is back together. I will never let anything happen to you or your sister ever again. Good evening, Charlie, how are you feeling? I'm okay. You as well, Mrs Chan? Well, if something comes up, just don't hesitate to call, okay? Mrs Chan. Hi, I'm Sheriff McTaggert. I'd like to have a few words with Charlie if I could. Uh, I don't think now is the right time. She just woke up. No mom, it's okay. Well you gave us quite a scare. We're really glad that you and your sister are safe now. I know you've got a lot of healing to do, but I need to know if there's anything you can remember from that night. I just remember that awful wolf costume. It smelled like a rotting corpse. And, he took my sister. He told her his name was Leon. Did you say Leon? Ma'am, does that, does that name ring a bell? Are you sure he said his name was Leon? I had a friend in college named Leon Fowl. He was the school mascot, but he was involved in an accident and, and I never saw him again. Leon Fowl? Charlie, do you remember that name, Leon, for sure? Is that what you remember? He never told it to me, but when I was talking to Rebecca he told her, he told her his name was Leon. That he wanted us to be his family. And he was sewing a glove into me. And then he killed my friends. You have to find him. You have to. He's gonna come back for me, he's gonna kill me. Charlie, we're gonna find him. He's never gonna hurt you or your family ever again. We've got a deputy right outside that door and he's not gonna leave that spot. - Perhaps now. - He's gonna kill me. Perhaps now is not the right time. I know, you're right. Maybe after Charlie rests a little. Yes ma'am. Well here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you my card. You do me a favor, you call me, anything, anything you need, you just let us know. Take care, Charlie. - Thank you. - You bet. Did you see that head? Yes, yes, it was hard to miss. No one gets in or out of that room that we don't know. - Yes sir. - You understand? - Yes sir. - Don't leave this post. - You understand? - Absolutely. - You, walk. - Yes sir. It's a fella named Leon Fowl. Leon Fowl. I need all the intel we have on him. Everything, anything. Anything and everything. Yes sir. - Got it? - Yes sir. Go do it. Sheriff, you have yourself a good night. - You too. - Thank you. The serial killer only known to law enforcement as the Lone Wolf Killer, is still at large. The two young girls who were kidnapped have been rescued and are receiving treatment, but the Sheriff's Department has yet to release their identities. We'll have more details as they become available. Dial 4256660. Shantell from Environmental, please dial 6660. Do you think they're ever going to find him? Of course, Charlie. I need to ask you a question. You said the man in the wolf costume was dancing? It was so terrible. Every time I close my eyes, I see it. I have a question for you too, mom. Who was Leon Fowl? He was a boyfriend of mine in college. One night, he was involved in a terrible accident. His whole body was burned. I never saw him after that. Do you think it could be him? I don't know. But I know they will find whoever did this. If I had never been taken, we might never have seen Rebecca again. Hello? Mrs Chan, this is the Sheriff's Department. Do you have time to talk? Of course. We ran Leon Fowl's name through our database and he was clean. We tracked down his last known location to Waverly Mental Hospital in Colorado. But don't worry, I have my men covering the state looking for this Lone Wolf character. You try to get some sleep and we'll talk in the morning. Thank you, Sheriff. We will try. I must admit, I have always loved seeing a woman in scrubs. Well you're lucky, 'cause I wear this every day. And I have always loved a man in uniform. Look, you've got to let me take you out for a night on the town. All the fun we would have together. Help, help me in here! Are you okay? Step back, I'm gonna kick the door in! A sandwich, huh? I'm hungry. Gotta just make sure this is Leon Fowl. Gotta have him right here. What the fuck? That's not him. That's what they brought in. Help, help! Please help! No!
