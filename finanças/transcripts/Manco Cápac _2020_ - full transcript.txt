Of course, I'll take you to Parque Pino, and I'll charge you 2.50 soles. From there, you keep going up. Please lower the price. How much do you want to pay? I only have 1 sol! Ah, you'd better go on foot. POWERFUL CHIEF Young man, there is nobody home! Why are you knocking? Madam, do you know Hermo Genes? Yes, but he is not here! What time can I meet him?

He's just a tenant. Do you know when he'll be back? Who knows when he'll be back! Can I wait for him? Why bother waiting? Sometimes he goes to La Paz, and returns a week later. Sheila! Sheila! Has the young man gone to the border? - Or where did he go? - To La Paz! See? He did go to La Paz. The person you are trying to reach is not available at this time.

Did you study anything? Not yet. I'm going to study at ESFA. What's that? It's an art school. And why do I care? You are wasting my time. I worked in a restaurant, a bit like a watchman, and did cleaning services. I need a receptionist. I can do that. Do you speak English? That position is already filled. Fine, in your case, leave your information, full name and telephone number. - Thank you Miss. - All right. - Good morning ma'am. - Good morning. I need a scooter. We don't have any more scooters. You're too late. And that one over there? This is the only one, but it's broken, its tires are bald. I can fix it, ma'am. The brakes are bad too. I can fix everything, Madam. Please, ma'am. I really need to work. Okay, come in. Now who can go with you? I have to stay at the store. Julian! Julian! Yes, godmother!

I'M HUMBLE...BUT NOT STUPID. 250 for the warranty and 15 for rent. Since you fixed it all up, I'll sell it for 150 soles. I don't have enough money. You can come back another day. The scooter will still be here. All right, ma'am. And bring me a water bill or a light bill. All right, ma'am. Good day sir! - Want to work? - Yes sir. Take this. Get in the car. The bricklayers I have hired are out dancing, getting drunk, those bastards! And on top of that, I paid in advance. - I hope you're a hard worker. - Yes sir. - Are you wasting my time? - No, sir. Idle people annoy me. To me, all idle people are delinquents! This way, come in. Put it there. See this pickaxe and this shovel? Bring it here. - You're going to make a ditch. - Yes sir. Come see. Sultan! - See these stones? - Yes sir. You start there and make a ditch all along here. You come this way... and go along there, behind the car, by the rocks. Okay? Start like this and dig deeper and deeper. Inclined so that the water can flow. - Clear? - Yes sir. - Do you understand? - Yes sir. Great. Sir, what about my pay? Don't worry about it. I'll see you later, before 5pm. I will leave some money for the soda. - Thank you sir. - Okay. - Get to work! - Yes sir. Good morning ma'am. Young man... Ma'am, I need a favor. - Do you have any leftovers? - I have. - Do you have a bucket? - Put here. Ready! - Thanks. - Right. Ma'am, I need a favor. Young man, are you hungry and that's why you came back? No, ma'am. It's about a job I got. I need a water bill or a light bill. Either one. Young man, I don't make enough for rent. If only I had a house... Could you talk with the owner? I can't, young man. That woman is bad, if she will not take you. Young man, have you had lunch? I'm still out of work. Sit down, young man.

Lady, give me a fish. - Which one? - The one that costs two soles. You better give me a mackerel. The mackerel is gone... - It's expensive and very small. - Why? Give me another, but only for 2 soles. It's fine. Here. - Thank you Madam. - Yes sir. Good morning ma'am! Back again? And always hungry! Are you going to keep asking me for help? I thought you already had a job. But you're back! When you get a job, I will be happy. Did you understand? You're always hanging around here like a dog. Go away! - Good afternoon, sir. - Yes? I have a chip to sell. - Is it a microchip? - Yes. Let me see. Here. My friend, that doesn't sell anymore. It's very old. Please, sir. - Just give me 1 sol for it. - No way. Go away. Sorry. Sir, we have fish, cheese... Sit down! Sorry, but could you give me some leftovers? Are you a thief or something? Yes, sir. I can help you? We have apples, oranges... Trash was hauled away yesterday. Good afternoon, sir. No, sir, I came for the job. Do you know how to be a waiter? Yes, sir, but not a lot. The fact is I'd prefer a girl. Sir, I've worked at a restaurant. Please, sir. I'm great at washing dishes. Hand me the tape. Hey, boy, come here. Put this shirt on. Here, it's not difficult. I prepare the drinks, and you and Felix serve the tables. Yes, sir. Don't call me sir. I'm Sergio. All right, sir. Idiot! Do you have a copy of your ID? I can bring it tomorrow. Welcome, good afternoon! Fast, you are too slow! Hey, boy. Boy, come on! What happened, beautiful? Are you tired? For you. See you Monday... Hey, where are you going? Hey! Here is not a place to sleep. Go away! Sir, can you change it for me? Where did you steal this? No, sir. Two soles for every dollar. They are very old. Ma'am, can I pay with this? I don't know what that is. Please ma'am, just a juice. Young man, I said no. Sir, can you change it for me? Old notes, no. Is that all, sir? No one will pay you better. Don't forget the keys. Okay. Good afternoon, ma'am. Young man! Where have you been? How are you doing? Have you got a job yet? I did, ma'am. You can have these. Oh thank you, young man! - Why did you bother? - No, ma'am, it's nothing. Why did you come so late? - Mommy, my snack? - Yes, yes. - What about the thing I asked you about? - We'll at home. Okay, mom. - Be careful, yes. - I will. - Come back early tomorrow morning. - I'll be back. - For lunch? - Yes, thank you, ma'am. Good morning. - Is Mr Suaica in? - He hasn't arrived yet. Could you give me his number? We do not have authorization to do this. I can wait? Better come back in the afternoon. - Young man, sit down! - Good afternoon, ma'am. Help yourself. Thank you, Madam. Where are you working? As a waiter, downtown. Okay! And didn't you go to work today? I start at 5pm. And how much are you earning? I only worked one day. Young man, you said your family is from Tacna? No, ma'am. Only my father is from there. Tell me... Does he know you are here? He knows everything. I met my father two years ago He took me in, but forced me to work very hard. Working hard is good. We can always be with the family. Don't make your parents angry. What are you going to do? Aren't you going to look for him? I don't know. Last time I went there, I just saw his face through the window. He hid. Quickly, he closed the curtains. His wife answered for him. She lied and told me: "He is not here. He is away. Why are you looking for him?" That's what she told me. Just like that? What else? He drinks too much. I can't talk with him. He gets very angry. I never understood it. And your mother? My mother... ...was my only family. She left this world two years ago. Young man, find some free time next week. I will, ma'am. I'm cook for a wedding and I need help. I'll arrange it, ma'am. So I want you to be there. Yes, I will be, ma'am. It's just for one day. Yes ma'am. Come back next week. Yes ma'am. They will confirm it with me. - Okay? - Thank you Madam. - Help yourself, young man. - Thank you Madam. - Good afternoon, sir. - Yes, young man? Mr. Suaica? He's already gone home. The morning shift guy told me to come back later. Come back on Wednesday. You will find him then, I'm positive. Can you tell him? He doesn't like when we bother him. It's just that he hired me. He did? Please, sir. I don't think he will see you. It's urgent, sir. Please, sir. - See the blue light? - Yes, sir. Next door is his house. - He must be there. - Thank you, sir. He left around noon. - I can wait? - Don't waste your time, young man. Better go to his office. - Where is that? - Around the corner. Turn the corner, keep going forward... until you see the watchman. You will see a lot people there. - Thank you, Madam. -Goodbye, young man. Good afternoon, sir. Sir... I remembered that before... I had seen some police on the second floor. - Sir, don't you remember me? - Calm down! So, I saw one of them, way back, where they sell... What is it called? Cards for the train... - "Fortunately." - Yes! We approach to tell the police What was happening... Sir, you hired me. Pay attention to your child. My son? You hired me, sir. I've been looking for you. You hired me the other day to work from your home. - Which house? - The ditch, sir. The ditch? Don't you remember, sir? You got to dig in front of your house. Oh! Yes! Holy shit, boy! I completely forgot about you! Fuck, I don't have any coins here. Come back any other day. Why is that, sir? Take it easy, young man. Don't worry... Lady, give me my change, please. Just a second, sir. How did you get back that day? On foot, sir. Really? On foot? Yes sir. Thanks. Here, take it. And this for the ditch. - And don't bother me anymore. - Thank you, sir. - Where were we? - The policemen... Yes, so... The policeman told me: "I can't do anything, no evidence." And then?

Don't come back! - Yes? - Miss, good afternoon. I'm looking for Hermo Genes. He hasn't appeared since Friday. Do you know when he'll be back? Who can say? Why are you looking for him? Let him know that I am a classmate of his. You must have met there. Why don't you come back on Friday? I will be back, miss. He shows up on weekends. Thank you, Miss. Miss, is he here? He's not coming today. - Are you Elisban? - Yes, ma'am. Sergio left something for you. Here it is. Thanks. - How much is this? - 25. - And how much is this, sir? - 15. Lower the price, please.
