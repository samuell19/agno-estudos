Can you tell me, Mig, about Dancing on The Wind? -It's a new movie. -New movie. Can you tell me a bit about your character? I starred as Cindy. She's 21 years old. Her background's a runner. She was an athlete, a runner,... but, suddenly, in the middle of her career,... at the age of 21, she lost one of her leg. That's because... At that point, she was depressed. In short, if you wanna die... -Just die, right? Yup. -The point is, just die? Mia, do you wanna add anything? Please. Okay. We will rec this for Dancing on The Wind. Diaz and Migi,... you will do... the rec, no, I mean, the reading. The reading with the local talents. Continuing our reading session on the other day. -Just the same. -On the other day? It's annoying. Pop, this behind-the-scene camera will be like this forever? No, that's one of my concepts regarding this BTS program. -What do you mean? -Possessive. -Possessive? -What do you mean by "possessive?" Possessive, clinging. -Clinging. -Shoot me, please. Always following you. This is my first feature movie. Yes, this is my first movie. But, I'm optimistic because our preparations are long and perfect. It's a good script and it will be a good movie. So, I want us to be focused... and it'll be listed in festivals too. So, we must win. -Amen. -Awards. If I am the camera, we'll win, Mia. What a narcissist. Anyway, for me,... festivals and awards are not important. The important thing is we work properly,... the budget is good,... and we look for profits. Okay? -Aye, sir. -It's about money. -Okay? Come on! -Yes. -Let's go now. -Yes. Gambir platform for Bima Train... from Surabaya Gubeng right now is... Please record the atmosphere too. Bima Train from Surabaya Gubeng is entering Jatinegara Station. Will arrive at Gambir Station in about 15 minutes. Mia, the tickets. -I bring them. -You do? At Platform Four, Argo Muria Train is entering. The destination will be Pekalongan and Semarang Tawang. Look out, Cungkring! You'll tumble! Based on a trusted source,... many said and stated... that Mia is an ambitious person. I just want to give my best for everything, Pop. The best. The best all I can do. I must do everything with my maximum effort. Possibly, it'll be my first and last work. Right? For instance, what if after shooting,... I was hit by a bus and die? -No way, Mia. -So, it will be the work... that'll be remembered. Am I right? For me, everyone must not work vaguely. -Az, Migi really needs the toilet. -Just a minute. Come on. I want to pee. Be quick! What are you doing? You're inside for ages. The water doesn't run. You're smoking dope, weren't you? Hey, don't accuse. It's smelly. Let's move to Sadha. Sadha, our director assistant, is here. Is it rolling? -Is it? -Yes. Right now, our train's having a technical problem. So, it must be repaired. I am not sure about the problem. But,... everybody's going out... It's crazy and exciting. Finally, we can... It's rarely for us to stop by the tracks. Where are you, Bram? At the front? Okay. He's already at the front. Let's go. Come on. Diaz, come on. -Dimas. -How are you? How are you? -You're very late. -The train... -stalled. -Why, Dimas? -So many people. -Please, meet everyone. -Mia. -Brama. BTS. What's up? I'm Brama. -This is our actor. -Brother. -Brama. -We're waiting for Migi. -Migi? -She's with Sadha. -What's wrong with her? Is she... -Toilet. She's not well. She's not accustomed to this. Okay, let's go to the car. Straight to our homestay. Where's the car? This is Migi. -One more. Our director assistant. -Hi, bro. I'm Brama. Let's go. Where's the car, Bram? -Over there. -Where's the car? -Over there. Okay. -Let's go. We already arrive in Yogyakarta. We're off the train. But, Migi's not well. Maybe, she catches a cold. She had vomited. Hopefully, she's alright. Come on. Any medicine? Is it often? Check it out, Mia. Her body's very cold. Where's the Taruna's driver? Just go straight to bed. Just a cold, maybe. Where's the driver? Just a minute, sir. Very stubborn. Where's BTS? Miss Migi, you're first. Sorry, Miss. -Where's BTS? -Don't... Just step aside. Daddy! Daddy! -BTS. We'll go later. -Yes? Just come in. Where will we be? If you still have seats, we can be with the talents. If not, I can go... -with... -We still have seats. I think there's enough room. This is Fort Vrede. This museum. I really want to go there. Do you see it? Fort Vrede? Aye, Kring. That's the post office. Then, Sultan's Palace. Old post office? -Old post office. -But,... let's get to know each other. Okay. -Mr Makmur. -Yes. My name's Mr Makmur. Hello, Mr Makmur. I'm Poppy. I'm in the BTS team with Cungkring, Mr Makmur. -I am Diaz. -Diaz. He's not important, Sir. What the heck! -Wongso returns! -Sir! Oh my God. Let's go, Sir! Quick! Sir, what will we do? Cungkring! -I'm shocked. Crazy. -I'm not afraid with ghosts,... but crazy man? No way, man. Ghost cannot do any harm to us, but crazy man can stab us. -I'm still shocked. -What did he say, Sir? Can you pass the water, please? Unclear. "Wongso returns." What's the meaning? I don't know. "Wongso returns." -He's crazy after all. -What's the meaning of "Wongso"? I don't know. Maybe, he looked for "wangsit", or vision. "Wongso", "wangsit". You, the gambler, usually look for vision. Right, GI? No. That's like my father's name. Wongso. -Really? -My father's name. -Who? -That "Wongso". Wongso is your father's name? It's alright, Mig. -Segoroyoso Village, Bantul. -Their yards are large. Please, come in. -Good night. -Good night, Sir. -Good night, Sir. -I'm from Jakarta. This is very late. Was the train late? The train was late, Sir. Sadha and Poppy. -Diaz. -Migi, Diaz. That's Cungkring, the camera person. -Good night, Sir. -Good night. There's a gamelan set, Dude. A gamelan set. Please. Wanna have a rest? Please. Cung, turn on the lamp. -What is it, Pop? -Just come! Quick! Come here. Hey, what's wrong? Cung, Migi heard... Crying sound outside. I can't sleep, Cung. Actually, I heard it too. -Please check it out, Cung. -I wanna check it out. -I'm afraid. -Do you want me to check it out? Yes. I'm with Migi. I will accompany Migi. -You go with Sadha. -Wait. What? Let's see. Crying sound at night. -Please check... -From outside, Cung. Your iPod. Is it turned on? That's it. -No. My iPod is turned off. -That's it. I also heard the sound, Cung. I will check it out. Please, help Sad. -Okay, Cung? -I can't sleep. -You can accompany me. -Yes, now, I can't sleep... because you woke me up. Yes. Blithesome, isn't it? I also cannot sleep. Come on, Cungkring. Please, accompany me. Okay. Now. There's nothing, isn't, Sad? Come on. Come here. Do you hear that? Frog sound? I do. Let's go. -Let's get back. -Crying sound. It must be Poppy and Migi! Sad, do you try to prank me? -No. -Woke me up. I'm tired, Bro. Come on. Stop it. Okay. Come on. Poppy, Migi. -Poppy? -Yes? Pop, that's not funny, Pop. Seriously. I'm tired, you know? I thought, you were the one who made that prank. Don't play around at this late hour. Okay? That's noisy. Pop. -That's not funny, Pop. -Okay, Cung. Let's go. Whatever. Come on. Whatever. Let's go. Why do you obey her, Sad? Because I hear it too. There you go. Do you hear that? Oh my God. Seriously. Right? Yes. I hear it too. Oh my God. Goodness. Over there, Cung. Darn. Darn. Do I get it? Ouch. Sorry. Sorry, dude. Satisfied? Let's get back. No. I will check it there too. Okay? I will check it there. -To make sure. -Darn. What is it? Goodness. What is it? -Let's get back. -Let's go there. -Let's get back. -I will go there. Just to make sure. I'm still curious about its source. No more, isn't it? Why are you still curious? Let's get back. Cung. Let's go. Darn. Wait. My battery. Darn. It's my light. Wait a minute. Wait. The battery is loose since yesterday. Okay. Okay. Hold on a second. Oh my God. What is it, Sir? I heard something, Sir. -A crying sound. -That's normal. That's normal. Please, come in. This is very late. -It's okay. That's normal. -Let's get back. -Thank you, Sir. -Yes, come on. Please. Yes, just come in. Okay. Once more, Az. -From the start? -Yes. From the start. Not quite right yet. Happy birthday, Honey. -Thank you, Babe. -Cut! Sadha, tell them about the mistake. Get back to your position. Okay. Do I need to smile? You said, you read it in Jakarta, Dha? -Let's go. -Again? Yes. Action. What time did you arrive, Sir? Seven o'clock. Happy birthday, honey. Cut! Thank you. Ateng makan kayu. Mig, just imagine, your leg is stumped, Mig. You only have one leg. Today, you use prosthetic leg. So? What's your motivation? You wanna meet your boy. It's been a while and you bring a gift. You wanna be loved, Mig, as it used to be,... when your legs are still complete, Mig. You, what's your motivation? -I... -What's your motivation? -I wanna meet her. -Wrong! Do I need to give them motivation too today? How long did they read the script? -Five, Mia. -What five? Five months? You defy me? Don't like to be scolded in front of the talents? What? What? Five days, Sadha! Next week, we will shoot it! Darn you! We have a break, everybody! So, this is my fate. Poppy's behind the scene camera person. Seriously. This is crazy. I come to the point where I am just a behind the scene camera person. I have to follow Poppy all the time too. -That's okay. She... -Poppy's weird. She always scolds me. She loves me. I know it. Migi says,... "Please, don't be crazy!" -"Please, don't be crazy!" -"Please, don't be crazy!" "Please, don't be crazy!" -Sir? -Yes? Is Borobudur still far away, Sir? Yes. About 45 minutes. -Oh my God. Please, don't be crazy! -Please, don't be crazy! Mother! Step aside! Hey, Diaz! Poppy! Migi! What are you doing? -Running. -We're not playing around. This is not a picnic. -Sorry, Mia. -Be focused, guys. You too, Poppy? -Sorry, Mia. -Sorry. -I'm focused. -Sorry, Mr Dimas. If you read the script correctly yesterday, there would be no problem. -Well? -Migi, go with Sadha. -Migi, come here. -Accompany Sadha. Escort him. I've told you, this is not a vacation. This is not a play. Come on. -Sorry. -Step aside! -Diaz! -Diaz! What do you want, Cung? I'm ready. -Alright! -Sunglasses again. I want to shoot a crime evidence. Poppy. Yes. Isn't, it? Her job is the easiest, but... Slobber. How could you do that, Cung? Satisfied? Do you still wanna be her friend? Let's see after we go off the car. Mig, use my torch. I can't see anything. Seriously. -It's very dark outside. -Sadha... -Nothing. -Lamp. -I have turned my torch on. -Crazy. Nothing. There's nothing in here. No phone signal too. Street lamps are on, but there's nothing. Even, no car. What's this place? It's very quiet. -I don't know. -Unclear. That's like a car lamp, Az. That yellow light. Let's try, Sir. -Tail light. -Give him signal. -Ask the driver. -Maybe, we can ask about the road's name. -What? -Yes! -What's that? -Diaz, Cungkring, Sir! Sir, horn them. Don't let them block us. -Sir! -Sir, what's that? -Cungkring. -Oh my God! Darn! Let's get back! -Sir! -Be quick, Sir! Diaz! Be quick, Sir. Back up! Back up! Oh my God. -Oh my God! -What's that, Sir? Please, protect us, God. -Just a minute, sir. -Don't be long. -I stay here. -Huh? I stay here. Be quick. Sir, can I ask you? Just now, do you see... Diaz, come back. Diaz! Idiot. Diaz. Where's the way to Yogyakarta? Diaz, come back. Just forget it. You're crazy, man. Let's go. -Forget it. -Look. Is he still looking down? That guy's wicked. -Sorry. We're lost. -I'm lost. We're lost. -Lost? -I'm lost. Disco? This is when discoes are usually closed, 2 AM. I was behind your car. Okay? I thought it was your tail light. Then, it grew longer and bigger. Then, fire. Boom. Where's that, Diaz? -In the Forrest. -On the street. Do you think... Disco light? I know the shape of a disco light. -Sir. -Come here. Just hear me. Relax, Dude. -You know, you do not respect me. -I respect you. No. Just listen. That fireball flied to our car... Keep your hands down! -Dimas! -Don't pull me. -That's it. Migi, just go in. -He talked above me. -Sir, I have the proof. -Whatever. I'm going to sleep. Sir, please listen to me. You ask me to read the script tomorrow. -Then, I have to sleep, right? -Diaz, please go to your room. -I don't like you from the start. -Dimas. -Migi, let's have a rest. -You drunk. -Hey, Dimas! What's wrong with you? -What are you doing, Sir? -Bring him in, Sadha. -The fireball of Kemang? -I have a good career, dude. -Stop it. -I have a good career. -Stop it. Yes. Come on. -I have a good career. -Stop it. Tomorrow is reading day. I don't wanna know about your career. -Dimas, stop it. -Die with your career! -Mia! -Darn you! -Let's go, Sadha. -Stop it, Dimas! This is it. Okay. Action. -Action. -From... Sorry, from the point when I... -From Anton. Did you read the line? -This is your job. -Give it to her. -After "action", you... -You... -Come to me and hug me. Just this part. -You only have one line. Come on. -Yes, try that. -Be focused. -Come on. -Action. -If you want to have a pee. -No. Come on. -Hurry, Diaz. Honey. Still need to read the script? This... Well? -Concentrate yourself, Migi. -I will try. Migi. Hello. What's wrong with you? -Haven't eaten, Mig? -I have. What's wrong? Sadha. -Sorry, I blank out. I'm fine. -Blank out? Be focused, Migi. Are you tired? You have eaten. Sleep? Not enough? Not enough sleep? You went around last night, didn't you? -I was lost. -Lost? That's your only argument. Right? Because you saw that light yesterday? -Why do you still mention it? -Yes, of course. This is the result. Just see it. We're only six days from shooting! Hey! Unbelievable! No one supports me! No one! You're all jerks! Wrecked! Cungkring, check it out. Some Grey hairs. Are you nuts? Back up. She's not well. -Diaz, where's Mr Dimas? -That's him. Mr Dimas, let's go. My car's ready. Just go to Migi's room. Bring the gong to the car with Sadha. Aye, sir. -Thank you, sir. Okay. -Well? -Where will you go? -Please, help us, sir.

Try that. -Diaz. -Yes. -I'll take her head. -Okay. -Pop, help us. -Come on. Okay? Ready? -One, two... Two, three! -My goodness. -Seriously. -Am I right? -Cungkring, how is it? -Something's wrong. -Let's try it again. One, two, three. -Very heavy. -Yes, isn't she? -Something's wrong. -Something's definitely wrong. Pop, help us. You help us. -Sorry. -The fan, please. Let's lift her up once more. Come on. -One, two... -One, two,... -Three! -Three! My goodness. Crazy. -Something's wrong. -Hold a second. -I will call Mia first. -She's already like this all morning. -Did she do something? -No. -No. -She must be... She's still breathing and everything. She just cannot be... What's wrong? What happened? We didn't do anything to her. -Mr Dimas. -This is outrageous. You all couldn't carry her? -Her body is very cold, Sir. -I swear, no one can't lift her up. -Pop. -Say your prayer first. Pop, call Mia. -Mia. -Come on. Together. -Diaz. -Let's go. -What's wrong? -It's confusing. -One, two, three. -She cannot be lifted. -Oh my God. -Are you serious? Very serious. I swear, Mia. Give me room. Hold on a minute. -Something's wrong, sir. -Yes, sir. Oh my God. -Very cold? How cold? -Okay, then. -Very cold, sir. -What will we do? -Hold her leg. -All morning, Sadha? Earlier, she was colder than this. -She has been cold all day? -All day. This is unbelievable. -Wait a minute. -Migi. It needs... Perhaps, she dies? I don't know. I'm confused too. Wait. -Dimas, what's the solution? -Give me time to think about it. Dimas. -Ask Dimas. -Sadha. Wait. -Help. -Cungkring, check it out. She sings in the middle of the night. -Oh my God. -Oh my God. Don't be worried Leave me alone Just you... Excuse me. May I know who you are? My name is Nyi Pramudhawardhani. I apologise, Grandma. Maybe,... my friends did something wrong. Why are you here? Don't be afraid. I will not disturb you. I apologise, Grandma. What's your intention... to be here? You all... must leave. Alright, Grandma. Farewell, Grandma. -Quick, Cungkring, shoot them. -Why don't you befriend Boen Boen? I thought you are my partner, Dimas. Just film them. Why do I feel that no one helps me? My assistant is dumb. He couldn't work properly. My talents are snooty as if they are big celebrities. -You too, Dimas! You should help me! -Hey. -Listen up. -What? You must differentiate your personal interest and... You too, stupid BTS camera. Darn you. Begone! I hate it when you always cling on me. Come here, Dimas. This isn't over yet. Just follow them. Okay? -Watch them. -I don't know how,... but I want you to send Migi home. Bring her away by any means necessary. -Replace her. -I can't. -So many talents are similar to Migi. -I can't. -I can't. -Why? What's the reason? Because Boen Boen's son likes Migi, right? I know that. Fire her. I don't like her. -Sorry, Mia. -What? What is it again? I just wanna say, if you want to fire Migi, don't do it now. -Why? -She's still not well. That's my business, Pop! -But... -That's not your business. What? Go away, jerk! -I hate you. -You will die young, Mia. I pity that girl. If that girl's still not well when she's back to Jakarta,... Yes. We'll wait until she's well. -That.. -Then, we begin to film. This my responsibility too. Yes, I know. That girl cannot be medically cured. Then, how, Grandpa? Buy some flower offerings. Flower offerings. Flower offerings. Note that. -They are three roses. -Okay. -White roses. -Okay. Three white champacas. Ada apa, Pak? Greetings. From north, south, east, and west corner of the Earth. All spirits and our ancestors. Look. Oh my God. Migi. Mr Dimas, that's Migi. Oh my God. Who are you? I'm Masrum. Who are you? My name's...

There's nothing anymore. -She's healed. -Yes. If there's anything, Dimas can call me again. If there's anything, we can call him again. -Yes. Hopefully, nothing happens. -Hopefully. Now, you can... feed Migi. -What? Eating. -She can eat now. Okay, then. I will give her water first. -Drink, Grandpa? -Poor her. -Please. -Yes, please. -Okay, Mia? Cung? -Okay. So, now, Migi can work again, can't she? Yes, she can. But, let her have a rest first. -Is it long? The healing process? -No. -But... -Excuse me. -What? -Migi's not there. Are you serious? -What do you mean? -She's not there? -Are you joking? -No. You didn't check her out? Sadha, did you seriously watch after her? -Yes. I was in front of the door. -In here? In front of here, Sadha? The door was closed. No one came in or came out. Then, where's she? That girl... was taken to another realm. -To where, Diaz? -Who... was taken away, Sir? To where? To their realm. Oh my God. -Sir. -Yes? Why did the shaman ask us to go to Parangtritis Beach? Well,... Migi was taken to another realm. Mr Masrum said,... Parangtritis Beach is the gate to their realm. There's a shaman -Who rides a moped There's a shaman Who wants to go to Parangtritis His helmet is white His hair is white too And flutters too -Yes, his hair. -What are you two doing? Nothing. -Stop it, then. -No, dude. If like this, I can get beautiful shots. The location is also beautiful. Miea, later you must see my video from this place. Director of Photography's nothing compare to this. Don't you think about it. -Mr Dimas. -What? He must be joking. Don't, Brama. Herbal drink, sir? Miss. Miss. Snack, sir? -What do you have, miss? -What do you want? This is chips. -What do you sell, miss? -Undur-undur chips... -She's pretty, dude. -And fried macaroni. Mr Dimas? What about this, Pop? Do you want it? -Miea? -No. -Cungkring. -Yes? Do you want it? Salak fruit, sir. No. Just ask her number. -What is it, Cungkring? -Ask her number. You're cunning, Cungkring. Eat first. Anything. Even only a snack. -What is it, Miss? -What? Your phone number? I don't have any phone, Sir. She doesn't have any phone, Cungkring. Goodness. Just to fill the void in your stomach. -Is it for me? -Yes, eat up. Actually, she asked about where we are going. I said, we want to look for our friend. Then, she said, "Please be careful, Sir." Don't forget to pray." I forgot, she also said, "I wish you good luck." She's nice. A perfect wife material. What? Why does she go there? Why does she offer to a shaman? -What? Why they... -They chat. Intimate. Why is that happening? She knows him? Huh? -I think they know each other. -Strange. -Any body wants it? -No. -Snacks? -No. We don't have any water. Excuse me, Miss. -I don't know. -Miea, excuse me! -Miea. Move away. -Cungkring, what are you doing? Miea, move away. What? Where is she? I don't know. To the sea, maybe? For Mr Boen Boen. This video is the proof... that his leadership in this production is unconvincing. He doesn't make any sense. What? Why? -You believe in the mystical. -You know, I'm in charge. Mr Boen Boen, I'm sorry. If someone's missing, you need to report to the police. -Right, Mr Boen Boen? -I'm still in charge and everything is okay. -Sir, trust me. -You don't follow a strange guy.

Where is it? What is this? -Okay, Sir. -Can you explain it? -We've been hypnotised. -I don't know, Sir. -We've been hypnotised. -I don't know where he is. The shaman was with you. -What did he say? -We've been hypnotised by... By that old man, right? He didn't say much. He only said, if we want to find Migi,... we only need to follow the jasmines. This is weird. Can you feel it? Do you feel it? We've been hypnotised by that old shaman. -That dumb shaman. -Don't say like that, Mike. It's you who lost your mind. Everyone is crazy. Migi. Migi. -Migi. -Mig. -Migi! -Where are you going, Migi? -Migi! -Migi! -Migi! -Migi! -Migi! -Migi! -Migi! -Migi! -Migi! -Migi! -Oh my God. -Migi! Migi! Nothing, right? Nothing. Migi!

From the forest. -Hey, Sadha! -Let's follow him. -Where are you going to? Listen! -Just follow him. -Come on. -Be careful, Sadha! Come on. Diaz, be careful. Come on. Hurry. Migi. Be careful, Sadha. -Go! Go! Go! -God save us, please. What is it? Huh? -There. -She's there, dude? What is it? -Slow down. -Yes. Grip on something. -Mr Dimas. -Yes, sir. If only my children live a miserable life... -Hei. -Hati-hati, Pak. If your life's miserable, don't you ever forget... to worship the Creator of Life. Because there are so many misadventures. When that happens, don't forget our Creator of Life. Because, everything... -is given by Him. -Bram. Nobody has the right to corrupt nature. If you corrupt nature,... nature will run amok. If nature runs amok, all living things will suffer. Got it? Yes, Father. But, everyone needs to live. If you need to live, don't corrupt nature. -Poppy. -If you corrupt nature,... -cutting down the trees,... -Pop, what are you doing? -Cungkring. -What is it? -What's wrong? -Miea. Miea. -What's wrong, Pop? -Do you find her? -Oh my God. -Goodness. What is this again? -They moved a while ago, didn't they? -Don't go there. Why? -Can you explain to us? -A while ago, the puppeter said,... "Nature must be preserved. If not, we will suffer." -Jasmines, sir. -Yes. -Jasmines. -Where? Project your torch. This is it. Okay. Let's go. -What? -Enter the Forrest again? You pass... Where are you going? Are you crazy? The instruction is clear. We have to follow the jasmines. -That's it, Mi. -Are you conscious? Never mind. Let's go, Miea. Come on. Let's go. Okay, slow down. Just slow down. -Poppy. -I'm at the back, sir. -You first. -I'm at the back with Cungkring. I'll walk slowly. The way is down.
