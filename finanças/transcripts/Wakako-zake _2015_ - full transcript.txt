Murasaki Wakako, age 26. Born with a taste for liquor, I wander the night yet again, in search of a place to be. A woman, drinking alone. Abe-chan, are you going on a trip? Yeah, I'm going to Korea with some friends. How nice. Korea has so much delicious food. Wakako, you sure eat a lot. We're going for 2 days and 1 night, so I'm going to eat everything I please. Barbecue, bibimbap, bulgogi, Buchimgae, soondubu-jjigae... *Savory pancake, tofu stew* You're gonna lose control. Barbecued meat... Bibimbap... Bulgogi... My head is full of Korean food! With that being said, I came here. While in Japan, there's a place that feels like Korea: Shin-Okubo! The wafting aroma of grilled meat... The shops are lined with kimchi and buchuimgae. That looks good... Everything's so alluring! I'll go to a nearby shop and have a little to drink. I'm irresistibly drawn to this kind of atmosphere. Which place is good? I guess I'll go here. Welcome! Table for one? Yes. OK. Have a seat over there, please. Excuse me. Here's your plate and hot towel. Thank you. Everything looks delicious. For the time being... I'll have chanja. *Spicy cod innards* Fish stomach can't be eaten by monks. To go with spicy food... I guess beer? Excuse me. Yes? Chanja and barley shochu with water, please. OK. Please wait a moment. I went with shochu. It's authentic... Excuse me. Here's your chanja and... barley shochu with water. This is your appetizer. Take your time Thank you. Amazing. This extravagant appetizer is unique to Korean food. And so... Thanks for the food. First, a small sip. A second sip. This is kind of like a jab. Barley shochu really pairs well with this! The spiciness comes later! Oops, I regret that. Because the food is spicy, you drink faster. Because the shochu tastes so good I'll have another bite of chanja. Tasty! The scent of the fish innards is spicy. These fish innards have a punch of cayenne. The many layers make this a snack that can be universally enjoyed. Somehow, the water in this made it feel light. Excuse me. Yes? Could I have the same thing, but on the rocks? Yes, coming right up. Excuse me. Barley shochu on the rocks. Thank you. I wonder if you can drink it like this. It's a bad way to drink it. Taste the iced shochu, then the chanja. The shochu with water is the chaser to the chanja! The limits of flavor increase and deepen! Pushuu~ I'm addicted to this chanja! I wonder if that red food is... tteokbokki. *Spicy stir-fried rice cakes* One of the representative dishes of Korea. *Makgeolli is a Korean rice liquor* Just as I thought, you have to have the authentic liquor, makgeolli. Excuse me! Yes? Tteokbokki and makgeolli, please. OK. Coming right up. Thank you. The ambiance emerges. Thanks for the food. It's delicious and easy to drink. But, it has a high alcohol percentage. I'll have to be careful. First, the fish cakes. This sauce is sweet! The fish cake goes really well with it. And now, the pain comes gently. It's quite spicy. The spice is neutralized by the makgeolli. Furthermore, I'm ready for the next bite. Japan's mochi is a little different. Sticky and chewy! It's really integrated with the sweet and spicy sauce. Sweet. Spicy. Sweet. Spicy. Sweet! Spicy! The makgeolli is greatly improving the tteokbokki! Pushuu~ It's one of the best things on Earth! And so I've been anticipating eating this hard boiled egg. The dark, thick egg yolk doesn't suit this sweet-spiciness. Excuse me! *Naengmyeon is a cold noodle soup* Bibimbap and Naengmyeon please. OK! Oh my! Rice and noodle is intriguing. Giving in to temptation is still something I enjoy. You went to eat Korean food? Yeah. No matter what, I was going to eat it. But there are way too many shops. It was hard to choose. I have a recommendation. The barbecue is delicious, but you have to try the pickled galbi! *Galbi are (usually grilled) short ribs* Pickled galbi? Yep! Is that the meat that you cut with scissors and eat? It's pickled in a secret sauce. It's really delicious! Secret sauce, huh? Because it was recommended, I'll have to go immediately. It's here. Welcome! Have you decided on your order? Yes. Pickled galbi and a draught beer, please. OK. OK. Certainly. Grilling meat alone would make someone speechless, but nowadays, one person is natural. Excuse me. I'm placing the charcoal. I'm hogging this grill all to myself with the mixed banquet set! Thanks for waiting. Here's your beer and appetizer. Here is your pickled galbi. Grill both sides, then cut with scissors to eat it. Got it. Thank you. First, thanks for the beer. Drinking beer while surrounded by the sound and smoke of meat is exceptional. This looks like a pot that you'd pickle plums in. Unknown treasure chest... open! Well now. Shall I glimpse inside? Meat that has been pickled in a secret sauce. This pot is packed with desirables. That's no good. I was about to be KO'ed from the start. I have to keep my spirit strong. It's longer than I expected! I'm unfamiliar with something of this size at a dining table. I'm getting excited! What a lovely scene. In some way, the time spent waiting might be the happiest. I think it would be good if it cooked quickly. but if it took forever to cook, I think that would be good too. If I knew how delicious it was, I couldn't turn back. However... Finally, the time has come. Turn it over... Quickly put it on the fire. Alright! Finally, it's time to cut the meat with the scissors. I'm ready. This feeling! Look at that beef! Well, let's go! Thanks for the food. Tasty! The sauce has a burnt flavor. The sweet-spicy sauce has deeply, deeply permeated. And so it is more than sweet. Fat. Fat. Fat! Above all else, this flavor is meat! The beer keeps coming and coming! Pushuu~ Meat. Meat. Meat! MEAT! Ah, it's so delicious! The surface is savory smelling, and the inside is juicy! There's still one piece of meat left. Next up is...a highball? Makgeolli? No, no. Let's roll with draught beer! Excuse me. Yes? Can I please have a refill? Certainly. The fat has made my stomach... No, my heart, full. Next time, I'll come with Abe-chan and Mi-san. Today's shops are Today's restaurants are Yan no Ie in Shin-Okubo. Enjoy authentic home-cooked Korean food in this bustling shop.

Regretfully, they closed their shop in early December 2018. *Samgyeopsal = grilled pork belly* Besides the pickled galbi, their samgyeopsal was perfection! In addition to bulgogi and bibimbap, they definitely had the standard Korean food. Grilling with Binch≈çtan charcoal, there was an all-you-can-eat barbecue menu. You could have eaten plenty of meat at this shop! Welcome! Gyuuya Closed shop in December 2018 Today's alcohol The alcohol that Wakako drank tonight is Satsuma's Ebisudo Co.'s Suijin no Mugi. This barley shochu has a high-quality, refreshing flavor. If you order 6 bottles or more than 5000 yen, they will make you a private label. It is recommended to commemorate something. Tonight again, thanks for the food. Pushuu~
