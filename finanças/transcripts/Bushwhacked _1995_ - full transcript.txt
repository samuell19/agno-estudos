Excuse me. Hey. Oh! - What can I get you? - Two packs of Marlboros... ...some Sno Balls and a jumbo Coke. Hello. Looking lovely today. Hey, Johnny! Hi! - Boss is looking for you. - Don't worry about him. - I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. - What's up, boss? - Hello, Heather. - Hi, Max. - What's going on here? - What? You got another package from Timberline Inc. And there's a special request for you. You've been going there a lot. - You got something going on there? - Maybe. You're living in a dream world. - So? - So dream on your own time! 10 a.m. guaranteed means 10 a.m. guaranteed. Ah. I'll get to you after work. This place gives me the willies. Let's make this fast. Give him the package. Get the tip. Hello? Anybody home? Hey, Mr. Bragdon? It's me, Max. And it's 10:00 sharp, just like you said. If you'd just give me that $50 tip... ...I'd be on my way. Sir? Hey, boss. Where are you? Mr. B.? You in here? Hmm. Mmm. Boy, something smells good. Hello? Hey, Mr. B. What's cooking? Oh, God! Fire! Mr. Bragdon? Are you in there? - FBI! You're under arrest. - There's a fire. - Put your hands up, Grabelski. - But there's a fire in there! FBI! You're under arrest. You idiot! Huh? - There's a fire in there! - And you started it. - I did not! - All right, don't do anything stupid. Try and stop me! Whoa! You idiot! Give me that goddamn gun! I'm gonna get you! You're mine! The FBI is gonna get you, boy. - Freedom Express. - Marty, it's me, Max. Grabelski, what's going on? A guy on TV said you killed somebody. I know, but it's not true. I didn't do it. - I was set up. - What do you mean? I gotta know if there's a package for Timberline Inc. or Reinhardt Bragdon. What does Bragdon have to do with anything? Because that's the guy I killed! - So you did kill somebody. - No! - I was framed. Marty, the package. - All right, all right. We believe that the murderer is a man named Max Grabelski. The motive is robbery. A million dollars of old money... ...which was to be taken out of circulation has been recovered. Mr. Bragdon, whose job was to destroy this old currency... ...uncovered the crime and was murdered for it. Marty! Marty! His body was burned beyond recognition. We had to identify him using only his teeth. It was gross. It was really, really gross. - Marty? Marty! - You're in luck, I found it. It's supposed to be delivered on Monday. That's three days. Same address? No. It says this package is going to some place called Devil's Peak. - That's up in the mountains. - The mountains? Who the hell goes to the mountains? Come on, guys, keep climbing. We're almost there. I'm slipping, Gordy. I'm scared. Don't worry, Fishman, I got you. This reminds me of the time I scaled Kilimanjaro. We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it. Hey, can I play too? Oh. - Kid, go home. - We're not playing, we're practicing. You guys are silly. - Troop 12, your Scout leader's. - Hi, Mom. Hi, guys. Go on inside. We have a new project. We're gonna get our cooking badges. Pudding. Gordy, you're supposed to get your cooking badge for roasting a porcupine. - This isn't scouting, it's home ec. - Lynn Strader's in underwear! Let me see! Sorry, she just ducked behind a house. - Barnhill, you're such a liar. - You're such a shrimp. - Take that back. - Make me. - Shrimp. - Liar. Oh, that hurt a lot. It says here that mini-marshmallows in pudding creates a visual feast. Ah! He's crazy! For our fire badge we had a weenie roast in your backyard. - Give her a break, Ralph, okay? - We've given her a break for six months. What's going on in here? Come on, settle down, guys. - I have a surprise for you. - Another surprise. - Don't worry. It'll get better. - It can't get worse. Guys... ...meet Kelsey Jordan. She's the newest member of the troop. - What troop? - Our troop, dear. - Ranger Scouts are for guys. - Yeah, guys in aprons. - Ranger Scouts. - Yes, can I... ...rent a Scout leader? Step away from the vehicle. You are too close to the vehicle. Step away from the vehicle. You are too close to the vehicle. Oh. - Hey. - Hey! Hey. - Got your keys? - Yeah. Good. I hate to do this, but... - Hey, mister? - Huh? I gotta make a dookie. I gotta make a dookie. The guy taking us has hiked all over the world. He won't be as good as the guy my dad and I had in the Serengeti. Barnhill, if your dad is so cool, why isn't he our Scout leader? Yeah, spies have a lot of time for the Scouts. Pills, pills. Stay in the front seat. - Air bag, son, air bag. - Yes, Pops. Where's Dana? His dad wouldn't sign his permission slip. Says he isn't big enough. Parents. - Nice dolls. - Did you bring a pink umbrella too... - ...in case it starts to rain? - Oh. No, I figured we could all just crouch under a pair of your underwear. - Rejected! - Okay, Troop 12, buckle up. - Bye. - Wait! Wait! Wait! Please, wait! Dana, I thought your dad said you couldn't come. He changed his mind. Here. My permission slip. - Well, good for you. - Good job, Dana. All right, we're going on a real overnight. Did this Scout leader guy really kill a mountain lion? - That's what they said. - And he climbed K2? - He saved 10 people. - I can't wait to meet this guy. Where the heck am I? Huh? Handicapped, huh? Hey, there. Need a little information. They're talking about the guy who killed that banker. Huh? Police have released photos of Grabelski. If you see this man, please contact the authorities... Excuse me, I'm looking for a place called Devil's Peak. Devil's Peak? The turnoff is a couple miles north. - Okay. - That's a tough climb. - What kind of car are you driving? - The one in the handicapped zone. "I am an inconsiderate person"? Did you paste that note to my window? That's right, cupcake. It's a lesson in common decency. - What? - It'll be a little trouble to get off. Just like what you would have caused a handicapped person... ...had they needed to pull in here and relieve themselves. They just said that Mad Max is heading this way. He's driving a stolen Volvo. A blue Volvo station wagon... - All right, freeze! - Hey, hey! - Right there, freeze! - Whoa! Take it easy. - You'll pretend to be me. - Give yourself up. - Give me that glue. - You could still be a fine Scout. - Where is that glue? - Top pocket. Put your palms up. - Now grab the wheel. - Are you nuts? I said, grab the wheel! I have got a gun, for christ sakes. - You're gonna pay for this, mister. - Put your chin there. - You do know this stuff is permanent? - Do it. Hey, I can't drive like this. Just keep heading south. Don't stop driving until Mexico. I'm gonna be behind you the whole time. Don't try any funny stuff or I'll blow your butt off. Got it? I got it. Keep driving. No funny stuff. Blow butt off. Right. - Looks like this guy's a no-show. - Maybe he's picking up special gear. Get out of the way! No! What is this, a parade? Would you move your wrinkled asses? I'm in a hurry here. - Hey! - I'm gonna run you over. - Gotcha. - Ah! I swear I don't know how it happened. It's all a big mistake. You gotta believe me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't be so hard on yourself. So you're a little late. I'm sure the kids are still raring to go. Wait, here we go, guys. - Lady, found him. - Guys, we're going on an overnight. Yeah! - It's Arnold Schwarzenegger! - It's so big! They're all yours. Mine? - One at a time, please. - Check out the hiking shoes. - What kind are those? - High-tech. They're Italian. - Must be those new Hikerellis. - Yes. Settle down. I'm sure Scout Leader Erickson will answer your questions... - ...around the campfire. - Scout leader? - Tell us about soloing the Big E. - About what? - Climbing Mt. Everest. - Tell us, please. Everest? Uh... Well... It was a bitch. Let me tell you, them Alps... ...they can get pretty... - ...steep. - Yeah, I imagine they could. - Mt. Everest is in the Himalayas. - Yeah, she's right. Yeah, but I had to cross the Alps... ...to get there. - Whoa! - Whoa, huh? Whoa! - The man's a god. - That's quite a hike. Uh-huh. Hey. Troop 12, get your stuff together. Time for a sleepover in the woods. - Sleepover in the woods? - I'm Aggie Patterson. I just wanted to say I think it's wonderful... ...that a man of your achievement takes time for the youth of America. Well... Mr. Erickson, I'd like to keep the kids gum-free. Oh. - Thank you. - Well, chief, off you go. Sir, can we make s'mores? I brought plenty of crackers. - Can we make s'mores? - What the hell am I doing? - Wait up. - Can you teach me to whittle? - Bye. - Bye. Cool jacket. Did you skin that cow yourself? Whoa! - Why didn't you bring a pack? - What do you mean? I did bring a pack. In fact, I brought two. - Who's got a light? - I do. You're not gonna leave that on the trail, are you? You're right. I gotta cover my tracks. - What's he doing? - I don't know. All right, Bunk 12, I want you to walk. I want you to keep walking away from here... ...towards wherever it was that you were going. And I will disappear into the jungle... ...and from a safe distance I will evaluate your walking skills. Oh. - All right? - Now I get it. All right, walk. Walk away. Walk. - This is so cool. - Bye-bye. Looking good. Okay, I'm out of here. Stand up straight. Remember, he's watching. Oh. Ow! Help! Help me! Would it be okay if we called you Spider? - Why would you wanna call me that? - Because it's your nickname. Fine, then, call me Spider. Spider. Spider? Spider! - What? - How come your nickname's Spider? Because I once killed a kid who called me Spider one time too many. How could he call you Spider one time too many... ...if your nickname wasn't already Spider? Spider! Ah. - Thank God they're here. - Grabelski, put your hands up. - I can't. - I repeat, put your hands up. And I repeat, I can't! You've got the wrong guy. If you don't come out peacefully then we'll use force. No, no, no. No, wait, wait. You don't get it. I'm glued... This is it? We finally go on an overnight... - ...and it's Grand Central Station. - It's better than my backyard. - Not by much. - Let's just get started. - Let's show Spider we know what to do. - Where is Spider anyway? Help me! They're eating me alive! Here, try my bug repellent. Good. Thanks. That's better. That's a little tangy. The manual says always find level ground to pitch your tent on. - Let's do that. - Too bad we can't go to Coyote Flats. - It's only two miles. - Red Rock Bluff's only four miles. But that's kind of far for Miss Ranger Scout. - I could get to Devil's Peak and back. - Oh, please. Devil's Peak? How do you know about Devil's Peak? It's right near your head. I don't know, sir. It looks like a pretty tough climb. It's class six. - That means experienced climbers. - How tough can it be? It's this far. - Are you guys a bunch of tenderfoots? - Not yet. We need six more badges. Huh? Badges? Well, let me tell you how you're gonna get those badges. By matching your wits against that mountain. By taking everything it has to offer and getting Max where he needs to go. Who's Max? Max? Who's Max? Max is all of us. Because we are gonna push ourselves to the max! - Yeah! - Are you with me? - To Devil's Peak? - To Devil's Peak! Hey. Ho-ho. Ma'am? Officer? - What's happening with the children? - I don't know. Wait for the feds. - What feds? What's going on? - I don't know. - Somebody must know. - What gave you the right to take Dana? Mr. Jareki, he had a permission slip. You can't tell the difference between my signature and a 10-year-old's? Dana! Dana! - Who's Agatha Patterson? - I am. Excuse me, sweetheart, is this the man you say took the kids? Yes, it is. We've got a fugitive on the loose, people. He's armed. He is dangerous. And he's got himself some hostages. - Aggie, help. - What are you doing? Get some water or something. This Scout's ready. Now, let's get going. We're going after this guy alone. Trust me, G-man, you don't take me... ...you won't get within 2000 vertical feet of this guy. Listen, pally, I know this Grabelski, and I'm as good in the woods as he is. And I don't have six hostages slowing me down. Without me you've got no chance. Okay, you come along. Just remember one thing: I call the shots. You just do the tracking. - Are we there yet? - Spider, are you all right? Yes! - Give me a match. - I'm working on my bird-watching badge. I see a scrub jay and a nuthatch and a SWAT team. - What? - Police. Lots of them. Give me those. - Oh, boy. Oh, boy. - Spider. We've got to hide! - We have got to hide! - You mean wilderness survival? Right. Come on, this ain't a nature walk. We gotta make up ground. - See anything? - Not yet, sir. Shouldn't we be on the trail? Kid, questions like that can get us killed. - Little cooler than my mom, huh? - Yeah. What? What? What? What, what, what, what, what? - What?! - Spider, look. That's the big deal? It's Winnie the Pooh. Hey, Boo Boo. What's the matter, you lost? - No collar. Must be a stray. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Relax, he's a pussycat. - Spider, maybe you shouldn't... Come on, give me your paw. He's sucking my thumb. Ah! Ow! Come on, tough guy, put them up. - That's not the one I saw. - What? - That's not the one I saw! - Huh? Nice teddy. Oh, my God! - Oh, God, he's dead. - No. No, he isn't. The manual says that if you're attacked by a bear... ...you're supposed to play dead. He's a master. Just stay still! That's not pretty. Spider! Spider! That was an awesome demonstration of how to handle a bear attack. - Spider? - What's he doing? - Spider? - Wake him up. Auntie Em. - What happened? - You were attacked by a grizzly. - But you played dead like a champ. - It was awesome. Of course I did. Now, I do not want to have to show you that again, okay? All right, now let's move out. Come on. Move. Get out of here. March on. March away. March... I'm alive! Little tougher than the StairMaster, eh, G-man? Listen, iron-balls, you take your time. I know guys like this Grabelski. When the pressure's on, they crack. We sing and sing and sing We sing and sing 'cause that's our thing We know this song will never end 'Cause when it's done we start again One, two, three, four We're Troop 12, the Scouts' top crew We yell "hurrah," we yell "hurray" We run, dance, sing and play We do good deeds We help our friends All right, knock it off! What is that? "We run and dance and sing and play"? - My mom kind of wrote the words. - Well, they suck, okay? - What? - I gotta pee. I gotta pee. So who's stopping you? Thirty years of scouting tells me we've made up a good chunk of ground. Hey! Hey! That's the ticket. A little spritz of cool, clean mountain rain. Shake your lizard, let it drain Move your hips and spell your name Send it straight, send it hard Now a sword fight, go: En garde I got some bad news for you, Palmer. That ain't rain. Eat your veggies, eat your starches Lean back, boys Golden arches All right, flip them and zip them. Let's get moving. - Hey, kids, don't move! - We just pissed on some guy's head. You! Oh, fu...dge. Run. Running badge time. Come on. Let's get vertical. Wait, you expect me to climb up with just my hands? That's right, doughboy. That's how it's done. How about when you get up there, you throw down a ladder? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. - I think I broke something. - Come on, they're getting away. - I'm coming as fast as I can. - Come on. Put your hand on the rock above your head. - What are you waiting for? Get going. - Are you sure it's safe? What's the matter, you scared? Let me tell you something. There's nothing wrong with being afraid. Spider, I'm afraid too. Shut up, you gutless worm! I'm talking to her! Put your right foot up there. Your right, not the left. Your feet are crossed. - We can't stand here. - I'll go first. You will? Let's go. All of you, move it. Come on. Hey, guys, it's easy. Ah! - Gordy, quit goofing around! - Gordy, are you okay? - We gotta move faster. Come on. - No, safety first. - We gotta go slow. - Safety? Safety first. I'll be right back. Keep going. - Come on, he's getting away. - Help me up. How much do you weigh? The guy weighs a damn ton. Oh, no. Run! Go! Run! Run! Go, go, go, go! Go! Go, go! Move it! Come on, go, go, go! Faster, you little... Move it, come on. Keep going. Go! Run! Spider, sir? Fishman? We got him! - Fishman, get over here. - I can't. I'm having a little vertigo. - I'm stuck. - I don't believe this! - Spider, are you nuts? - Maybe I am. Now, get over here! Stay with me, G-man, stay with me. All right, here we go. Goodbye, Grabelski. Hello, $1,000,000. Don't you dare. There's a Scout on that bridge. Come on. - Get over here! - You may find this hard to believe... - ...but I'm a little bit of a coward. - You are not a coward. You are Milton Fishman, the superstud! - What? - Say that. Say, "I'm Milton Fishman, superstud!" It'll give you courage. I'm Milton Fishman, superstud. I'm Milton Fishman, superstud. - Yes. - I'm Milton Fishman, superstud! It's not working. All right, that's it, Fishman. Last thread. It's been nice knowing you. I'm Milton Fishman, superstud! That's it. Come on. Come on. Yeah! I did it! I really did it! I'm proud of you. Now, get the hell out of here. - Well, tracker man, what do we do now? - We've got no choice. Gotta go around. Everybody stay calm. We have no good news as of yet. - Let the man speak. - Please be quiet. And no news is... No. No news is no news. Unless it's good news. But we have no news, so... Good. - Spider, I'm getting hungry. - Can we stop for a rest? Don't you think it'd be best if we camped here for the night? All right, I guess we bought ourselves some time. Bought ourselves time for what? Well, guys, we gotta start a fire. Better start looking for pine cones. Pine cones? The manual says when you're surrounded by green wood... ...always use pine cones to start your fire. If the manual said to stick your wiener in a light socket, would you do it? - Check this thing out, it's huge. - Mine's huger. - There's lots of them up here. - Look at this baby. - It's as big as a football. - Yeah! - Hit me. Come on, hit me. - Go, go. All right. Four-44. Four-44. - Hit me, Spider. - Red dog, red dog. Hut, hut, hut. Deep! Way back. Way back. Go, go. Nobody's open. He's gonna have to run it. I don't think that's a pine cone. Oh, mother. You haven't had one of those seizures for 20 minutes. That's a good sign. - How's that feel? - That's good. That's good. He thought a beehive was a pine cone? - What are you thinking? - I don't know yet. Ah! Davy Crockett, catch anything yet? That's right, make jokes. That's what's wrong with this country. Everybody wants it now. Nobody's willing to hunt down what they need. That's what I try to teach my kids: To hunt down the goodness in life. You might say I'm the thin khaki line... ...between morality and depravity. Friend, there's no telling what kind of depravity Grabelski is up to right now. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Hey, got the tent up. - What are you working on? - It's a crystal diode receiver. - You know what that is, right? - Yeah, of course I do. - And that is a beauty. - That's the toolbox. Well... Um... - Guys, look what I got. - Whoa, let me see. Ever seen that, Barnhill? Probably don't know about the birds and bees. - And you do? - Yeah, that's right. I do. Yeah? Go ahead and explain it to us. Well, I... I know it's about making babies. It takes a man and a woman to make it work right. And they both have to go into a room... - ...and they take their shirts off. - No, no, no. The man doesn't have to take his shirt off... - ...just the woman. - Oh. Hey, what have you kids got there? Give me that. You guys shouldn't be looking at this stuff. - Uh, Spider? - Huh? Could you tell us about the birds and the bees? Yeah. I don't think I'm really the right person to... But the manual says the Scout leader is supposed to tell us that stuff. - Really? - Yeah, really. - Yeah. - Well... If it says in the manual, I guess... All right. Uh... All right... Let me borrow your dollies, honey. Okay. Okay. Now, once upon a time, there was a man dolly... ...and there was a lady dolly. And they fell in love. Tonight on Eyewitness America, "Scout's Honor: The Hostage Crisis. " Oh, my. Our son's a hostage. Whatever he's going through right now, I'm holding you responsible. Work it, baby! Work it! Oh, that's good. That's it, right there. Oh, that's good! Oh! That's it. That's how Daddy likes it. Everybody start your engines! Then... ...the man has a cigarette, watches a little Leno... ...and goes to sleep. Any questions? - You don't have to. Okay. - Okay, guys, I got one. What if a blizzard came in and everybody else died? You can either starve to death or eat the frozen bodies and live. - I'd eat the bodies. - You'd eat anything. -Yeah. - I'd eat the bodies. Not your body. But I might take a chomp on you. - Spider, you do one. - Me? - Yeah. - Let's see... All right. What would you do if you were a delivery guy... Okay. ...it's your last package, you pull up to the house... ...and it's this huge mansion, the biggest house you ever saw. You ring the bell, the door opens and there's a sharp-looking guy in a suit. He pulls you inside and he says: "Today is your lucky day. I got a deal I wanna make with you. I got six packages coming to me over the next three weeks. If you can deliver them at 10:00 sharp, when it's dark... ...I will give you $50 a package." - Sounds weird. - Sounds cool. So you say to the guy, "What's in the package?" He says, "I can't tell you. Our lives might be in danger." - This is a good one. - Part of you knows something's fishy. But the other part of you is thinking... ...this secret package stuff might be kind of exciting. Kind of like a spy or something. I mean, being a delivery guy, that can get kind of boring. Anyway, the guy takes a real $50 bill and he slaps it in your hand. And he says to you, "Are you in?" What do you do? - Do you take the deal? - Sounds like a setup. - And illegal. - The guy sounds like a criminal. - Do you know him at all? - No. - Are there any witnesses? - Uh, no. Any way to protect yourself in case you're blindly walking into a trap? No. - Only a sucker would fall for that. - Or a doofus. - Or an idiot. - Or a sleazeball. Spider, do another one. That one was way too easy. No, I'm gonna hit the hay. I'll do one, okay? - Yes! - Can you really hear anything? - "The prayers of the entire country... - Religious program. - ...remain with Troop 12... - That's us. - Why are they talking about us? - ...held hostage by a murderer." - Spider? - His name is Mad Max Grabelski. - It's him. - Oh, no. - Guys, quiet! - We're stuck with a killer. - A psycho killer! - That's not covered in here. Come on, we're Scouts. Remember? Let's act like it. - We're all gonna die! - I wanna go home. - Let me at him! I'll bust him up! - Don't you get it? We're dead. - They'll never find us up here. - We'll take care of that. - Hurry up, Fish. - "H" is two longs and one short. No, stop. Wait. Two shorts and one long. Great. What are we supposed to do, cross that letter out? - God bless those little Scouts. - What? What do you see? - Smoke signals. Right by the book. - Oh, yeah. - Well, almost. - What do they say? "Belp. Belp." Here we go. Some allergy medicine. - Today, Fishman. - Some cough syrup. - Fish, hurry. - Hurry up, Fish. - And sleeping pills. - Are you sure it will knock him out? One sip and he's Sleeping Beauty. - We've got ground to cover. - Oh, God, this better work. Spider? - Come on, Fish. - You can do it. - Make sure he drinks the whole thing. - Don't be scared. Spider. Hi. Hello there. - Want a drink? - No. - But you're thirsty. I can see that. - Fishman, I don't want a drink. What do you think, Gordy? Doesn't Spider look a little parched? - Yeah. - Give me the canteen, okay? That is good! - Thank you. - Wha...? Hey, ho, hey, ho. - I feel good! - Sleeping Beauty, huh? Come on. Everybody now: We're Troop 12, the Cub Scout crew - I sprained my ankle. - Come on, Ralph. - Ow. - Come on. Shake it off. Use the other one. I think I sprained mine too, Mr. Grabelski. What'd you call me? Uh... I called you Polenski. I had a Dr. Polenski once. You suddenly reminded me of him. He treated me for cryptorchidism. Undescended left testicle. Funny, I can feel it going back up there right now. No, you called me Grabelski. - How'd you know my name? - Oh, God! How'd you know my name? - I want some answers! - Please don't kill us, Mad Max! - We caught Mad Max! - He's over here! What do you know? I'll take six Ranger Scouts... ...over one federal man any day. They captured Grabelski. - I didn't do it. - We don't feel sorry for you. - You're a murderer. - I didn't kill anybody. I'm innocent. Well done, youths. I'm Agent Palmer, FBI. - I thought there were two of you. - No, only me. All right, you're all heroes. Every one of you. Very, very wonderful, okay? Over here, now. Okay, kids. You just wait here for the rescue team. I will take care of the bad guy. Come on, Mad Max. Move it! Let's go! Take care, kids. Get up! I didn't do it. Let me get to Devil's Peak. - There's another package of money... - Save it for someone who cares. A helicopter! We're saved! - Where's he going? - Something's not right. What is with you and all the pushing? I wanna speak to your superior. Is that him? Mr. Bragdon? Hey, Mr. Bragdon, you're alive. - He's alive. - Hello, Maxwell. Look, it's over. This guy is an FBI agent. You gotta give yourself up. So the plan blew up in your face. The important thing is you have your health. And your teeth? I thought they found your teeth in the fire. It was inconvenient having them pulled. But at a million dollars a tooth... - ...I think it was well worth it. - Huh? - Kill him. - Kill him? I can't kill him. - He's just doing his job. - No, Maxwell, not him. You. Me? Wait a minute. You guys are in this together? He's in on this? And you were with him? And when you're done with him, kill the kids. - The kids? - Come on, move it. Max was telling the truth. We gotta rescue him. - How are we gonna beat those guys? - I've got an idea. Everybody, close your eyes. Oh, boy. - Why'd you pick me? - Because you're a pathetic loser. - Nobody gives a damn about you. - Ah. You're wrong! We give a damn. Fire! Way to shoot. Your bra works great. - Way to go. - It's almost like getting to second base. - Fire. - Keep them coming. Oh, no. - Oh, no. - You little brats! - Split up. - Not me. I'll take them both on. Don't run away. I just wanna talk to you. - Run! Run! - Come back here! Oh, God! Oh, God! - Where's Dana? - I don't know. - He's gone! - Come on! - What do we do? - Jump. Come on, they're trapped. Come back here, kiddies. Come back here, you brats. This better get us our swimming badges. - Fishman, you've gotta jump. - Superstud. Superstud. Superstud! What is with these kids? Quick, the chopper. - I can't swim! - I got you. - Those kids are nuts. - Forget them, let's find Grabelski. Damn! - Gordy! - Max! Gordy! Come here! Max! - Grab on! - I got you! I got you! Grab on to me, Fish. Come on. Did I ever tell you you're a hell of a Scout? - Where's Dana? - I don't know. Oh, my God, we lost Dana! Where is he? I see them. I see them. We passed them! All right, I'm turning around. Kids, I got you. Waterfall! Waterfall! Get to the side! Swim to the side! Max, grab something! - Dana? - Hi, Max. Where have you been? We've been worried sick! - Shut up and hold on! - Pull! Don't let go! Hang on! Pull! I got you! Come on, kids! Hold on, Danal! Get out. Yeah! - Way to go, shorty! - I might be short... ...but I'm real strong. What is it? - Throw your packs in the river! - What? - They'll think we're dead. - Throw them in. Throw them. Do it. Throw them in! - My climbing stuff's in here. - Give it up. - Go, go! - Hide, guys. Get in the bushes! Hide! - Go! - Come on, go! It shouldn't be this hard to kill six Scouts and one moron. Relax. What we couldn't do, Mother Nature did for us. Hey, it worked! It worked! - You are a good Scout. - Now what? I'm sick. I'm definitely getting sick. Guys, come on. I found a cave. I'm coming. Mrs. Patterson, I have to apologize to you. I've been dumping my anxiety on you. I feel terrible. But my Dana, he's my first, and I just get very emotional. I remember when he came out at the hospital, he was so small... - ...like a little duckling. - Mr. Jareki? I think you need to call your wife. She's probably very worried. Oh, yeah. My wife? Call my wife. You got 20 cents I could borrow, please? - Take what you need. - Thank you. You're good. Devil's Peak? If we go after Bragdon by daybreak we could surprise him. - Yeah, that could work! - We'll just rip his head off! Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's too dangerous. But we have to make sure the whole world knows you're innocent. You're our Scout leader. You are still gonna be our Scout leader, right? Yeah. Of course I am. If you get the electric chair, put a light bulb in your mouth... - ...like Uncle Fester. - That's a good idea. Hey, Max. - You're up early. - Hey. - Something wrong? - Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Get up to Devil's Peak in three hours, intercept the package... - ...turn it in and be done with this. - I'll go wake the guys. - Sure you wanna do this? - Are you kidding? We didn't come this far to quit now. Go scout ahead. Two hours. Oh, boy. We're never gonna make it. Devil's Peak, Devil's Peak. Okay, Devil's Peak. I knew it. Reinhardt Bragdon. - Mr. McMurrey, I found something. - It's Scout Mother Patterson. - Sorry, this is a private briefing. - He's heading to Devil's Peak. Why would he want to go to Devil's Peak? A cabin up there belongs to Reinhardt Bragdon. - How do you know that? - I'm a real-estate broker. - It's been listed for six months. - Real estate, eh? Okay. Well, thanks for the tip. Now, if you'll excu... I told you where those kids are. Get your skinny butt up there... ...and rescue them. Or do I have to do it alone? Whoa! God. Whoa. Whoa. Come on, guys, just like we practiced. Just let me break out my Kilimanjaro gear. - You're full of it. - You're such a BS-er. - Did you just rip one? - I did not. - You stink! - Knock it off. - I can't climb behind this guy. - Don't make me climb down. Damn it. May I be of some assistance? Oh, no. How are we gonna get over there? There's no more ledge. We can't get across. You're gonna need to use these. Here we go. Hold this. That's your climbing rope. This is your hammer. And these are the pitons. Hammer a piton into a crack. Barnhill, knock it off. You have no idea what you're doing. All you gotta do is pass the rope through and belay yourself off. Belay myself off? Belay myself off?! Hey, Maxie, hit that thing till it rings. He's gonna get killed. Barnhill, I know this is a bad time to be asking... ...but you really did climb Kilimanjaro, right? - I'm telling you, I did. - That's good. That's good. Because if you didn't, tell me now... ...and I promise I won't get mad or anything. I swear. - See? Nothing to it. - Piece of cake. Officer, what's the matter with you? I demand you do something. You demand? When there is something to do, we will do something. But Mrs. Patterson told you there is some cabin somewhere out there. Right, Aggie? Aggie? Keep going, guys. You're gonna make it. - Whatever you do, don't look down. - Too late. - We're gonna make it. - Max, give me a hand. - I don't believe it. - Well, Max, we tried anyway. Not everything. According to your body mass, you can hold out for another three minutes. Oh, good. Then take your time. Move! Ouch. Fingers. Guys? Guys! Very funny. - Where's the truck? - Relax. It'll be here at 10:00. - It's guaranteed. - Killing Grabelski's one thing... ...but I wasn't counting on killing these kids. We've got a big bundle. Let's take this and go. That truck is delivering the last $10 million. We're not going anywhere. - We made it. - This is awesome. - We made it. - All right. Devil's Peak. We made it. Hey, there's the truck. Hide. Hide. - Right on time. - 10 a.m., guaranteed. Sign here. What do you see, Fishman? I see that FBI guy. I see that other guy loading money. And I see Gordy's mom tied to a chair. - What? - Max, what are we gonna do? - Sir. - I'm thinking. I'm thinking! - This'll work. - We're going with you. - No. I said, no. - It's my mom. Listen, I got us into this mess and I'm gonna get us... - I'm gonna get us out of this mess. - Oh, boy. What? Is something wrong? No. Then start loading the money into the chopper. Guys, please. Just sit tight and stay here where it's safe. - Oh, my God! - This is too touching for words. - Do something, Max. - Don't worry, Grabelski. You'll be the first one to get it. Don't! Listen, I just wanna tell you one thing. What? You are a disgrace to the FBI. Oh, that hurts. Now I just wanna tell you one thing. - What? - You're a dead man. - Hey, cupcake. - Oh, no. - Who is he? - Hey, Sergeant Doofus. - We gotta have a little talk. - Not now. I gotta help Gordy's mom. - Stay here and watch him. - Hold him down. - What do we do with him, sir? - I've got an idea. Yeah, cool. All right Palmer? Palmer! Marvelous. Mrs. Patterson! I'm not really a Scout leader. My name is Max. I'm here to save you, okay? Now, be very quiet. You're a lying, irresponsible... We'll get to know each other later. All right, now... - What kind of knots are these? - Oh, my God, he's an idiot! - A lesson in common decency. - Good job, Dana. - Well? - We need handcuffs. So it's not a figure eight, a butterfly or a fisherman's. - It's a clove hitch. - Thank you. I learned it in the Scouts. Let me show you the wonderful view off the porch. - You don't wanna do this, Mr. Bragdon. - Of course I do, Maxwell. I'm sorry. It was a pleasure doing business with you. No! No, Gordy! No, Gordy! That was one of my kids, you crazy sicko! - Mom! - Gordy? Help! - Gordy, where are you? - I'm down here. Help! Hold on, honey. - Gordy? - Max! - Oh, boy. - Max! Hey, kid. How's it hanging? - Wait up. - Where's Gordy? - I'm coming down. - No. You don't know what you're doing. Of course I do. I'm the Lizard. Remember? - You mean the Spider? - Right. Gordy. - Where is he? - Down there. I'm just a delivery guy. Reach. Come on, reach! - I can't. - Reach and I'll grab you. Whoa! Gordy, come on. - I'm scared. - Believe me, I'm scared too. Now, you're gonna have to let go. Come on. Come on. Let go. I got you. I got you. Ah! Gordy! I got you, kid. I got you. You've got to stop goofing around like this. Don't let go! - Here they come! - Gordy! - Hold on, sweetie. - Yeah, Gordy. Come on. I got you. - We made it. I can't believe it. - Thank you. Thank you, Max. It was nothing. Just a little mountain. For achievement in climbing, survival, rescue and citizenship... ...above and beyond the call of duty... ...you kids went right past Tenderfoot badges and on to something greater. Therefore, I am very proud to present each one of you... ...with the Rangers' highest badge: First Class Eagle. You earned it. How about it, folks? Way to go, guys! Let's hear it, folks. Now, as for you, mister... When you took these kids on an overnight... ...you broke every rule in the book. But when they got into trouble... ...you demonstrated the kind of courage, values... ...and honor that are the cornerstones of the Ranger Scouts. It gives me great pleasure... ...to present Max Grabelski... ...with the badge of Ranger Scout Leader. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, guys, look at this! I'm a real live Scout leader. Thank you. Thank you. - Now, for your next assignment... - Next assignment? ...you and the kids are gonna hit Yosemite, and you'll hit it hard. I get to take you on another overnight! No, Mr. Grabelski, not just your kids... That'll be... Huh? ...all the kids. Hey, wait! Get off of me! Get off! Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ENGLISH]
