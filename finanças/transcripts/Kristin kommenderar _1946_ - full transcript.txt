KRISTIN TAKES COMMAND What does this tell me? Have you never been to an auction before? Watch out now! You, Johan... the man who can never get a maid to stay with him. This opportunity has been created for you. Make an offer now. 30 riksdaler offered. 30 riksdaler? Are you trying to ruin the parish? Karin is old, but she's good with her fingers. There's no one in the parish who can knit socks as warm as she can. 25 offered. That will be fine, said the church usher... ...who received a trouser button in the collection. 25 Riksdaler. First, second... You know what it means to be hot about the feet... ...when you crawl to your missus of an evening! Does she eat a lot? She won't eat you out of house and home. - 20 riksdaler. - That sounds better. 20 riksdaler! First, second, third time. Karin Lovisa Jonsson to Anders Nilsson at Broddetorp. What's going on here? It is an auction for poor women... ...and children whose parents can't provide for them. That's surely just slave-trade. It's not that dreadful. They are given out for food and clothes to the highest bidder. That means the lowest offer. Come on, Karin... we're going home to Broddetorp. Now we have Anna-Lisa Karlsson and her daughter. We'll take them one at a time. Daughter first. See what a good-looking maid she can be! I want to be with you, Mum, I want to stay with you. Quiet! I do all the yelling here. You mustn't take my mother away from me. You can't! Why are you being a cry-baby? You'll be better off than now. You can stay with your mother. I'll take care of these two. Without compensation from the council. The agreement applies to food, housing, clothes. They won't lack for anything. Write it down. Anna-Lisa Karlsson and her daughter are taken by the GP, Dr Westman. I'm going to withdraw money today. It was safest to change the time beforehand. Otherwise I might have been tempted to redeem it. Can I have a look at my treasure? I haven't seen it for a while. There... My good old friend. It's the only family jewel I have left, Bank-Manager. To Harald Westman with thanks for a good deed. It's not always "like father like son". Thanks, Bank-Manager. - So long! - Goodbye. Oh great! Now the garter is broken, too! PUBLISHERS Good morning. Is the way clear? Yes, go in, Miss Hagstrom. ADVANCES WEDNESDAYS ONLY Money's falling from heaven, today. I seize the last seam. Was it the young lady's property that was rolling around? - There you are. - Thank you. It was my reserve fund that escaped from me. Rockefeller also started with one cent. He doesn't know what women can do with a one-cent piece. Well, I think I can just about guess! Where have I seen you before, Miss? Miss can't remember. Now I remember! The girl in the window... A pair of stockings. - Now I recognize them. Kayser? - That's right. "Better and better every day" Now you can introduce yourself, because we're old acquaintances. Westman. Miss Hagstrom? Come in. Thanks. Mr Hansson... What does Miss Hagstrom do here? She illustrates short stories that are translated. - Poor woman! - You might think so. You've had worse translators. Yes, but we satisfy everyone's tastes, as you well know. Hansson... Is that the only way out of the office? No there's not. Do you need an emergency exit? No, quite the opposite. So long, Mr Hansson. Now things are looking up a bit. Don't do anything foolish with it, Miss Hagstrom. No, never anything foolish. I'll just buy an apartment in Ostermalm and a castle on the Riviera. And then retire and live on the interest. Mr Hansson, please look at the ceiling for a moment. At the ceiling? Did you keep your eyes on the ceiling? What does Westman do here? Translates the short stories that you illustrate. - Poor man! - Say no more. Think of all the love he's had to forgo for 15 kronor per column. Don't you know, Mr Hansson, that "love we must have, if ever so little." Bye bye! Very kind of you to want to walk with me, but I live almost next door. You're not going home now, are you? It's lunch time. Can't we have lunch together? Of course, so long as we pay for ourselves. Where should we go? What good place is there? The Opera Cellar is one. It's a bit draughty there. The poor man's porch at The Grand? That's only for rich people. Well then... the zoo? Alhambra? Blue Gate? Solliden? Hasselbacken? I said that we'll each pay for ourself. How much will it be for me? There were two sandwiches, 50 cents. A glass of milk, 15 cents and a coffee, 20 cents... 85 cents. - Keep the change. - Thanks. It's my first time out with a lady, without paying. There's a first time for everything. You said you were a graduate... What in? - Philosophy? - No, medicine. A doctor? Where do you practice? I don't. Probably never will, either. What do you mean?! Just when I'd started, I lost my dad. He had enough debts, so it was pointless that I made new ones. And so you translate short stories instead? That's dumb. I know. But "there is no human being." That's how much psychiatry I managed to read. Now Westman has gone nuts. Has Hansson spoken to him? This is the 4th translation where he christened the heroine Marianne. It doesn't testify to any great originality. And if they don't have almond-shaped brown velvet-smooth eyes... The whole box and dice... Have you seen the illustrations? The Bedouin Shams-el-Naha. Not so bad. A real he-man. Here we have William in "The Mysteries of Love". But what the hell now? The same man in every one! She has to do it again! That won't work. Don't you recognize him? - What in God's name? It is... - Right! Marianne Hagstrom's favorite sheik... William August Westman. Heavens above! Call them immediately! I have to talk to those nut-cases! That won't work... There's no phone-line to heaven. At least not until the seventh. Say, Marianne... Wasn't that a brilliant idea? There's something in it, of course. Isn't there?! We have double setups of everything. Two coffee pots, two frying pans... Hey... how are you off for plates? Plates? The PLATE, you mean. Yes, I have it. Then you have one more than me. My last one broke this morning. That was a bit careless. But the saucers are intact. Magnificent! It's done, we're getting married. As soon as the wedding was over, ...they moved into the lord's castle, with 24 rooms. And now only one thing was missing to complete their happiness. Hello... yes, it's me. What do you mean? He hasn't said? And everything's fine? Thank you, dear sister! Yes, thanks! Excuse me, has something happened? Is it obvious? It certainly is. Wonderful! Do you have any children, constable? Yes, I have a little girl. One! I've got twins. 7.5 kilos. In total, of course. Congratulations... Keep up the good work! Thanks, the same to you. Darling, can't we send the laundry out? 10 jacket, 10 nappies and 10 bibs every day. - Do you think we can afford it? - No. What does the cat say? What does the lion say, huh? What does the rooster say, huh? Daddy, Daddy... Daddy, Daddy! Yes, Daddy. Marianne? Sonya says 'daddy". You're wrong there. She asked if dinner will be ready soon. She certainly does. You just don't want to believe it. Daddy... Billy, answer the phone, please. Westman. Just fine. The little princesses steal some time of course. You can work at night to help, instead. No, my wife can't take on any more work. Billy, give me the phone. Hello? This is Mrs. Westman. Yes, I understand. Well, it's not that serious. I still have time for the double murder in the catacombs before Friday. Worse things have been experienced. No problem. Goodbye. You can't possibly take on more work. YOU can't work more than you do. - We have to earn more money. - We've managed alright. Yes, now yes. But in a little while... Marianne! It's not possible, is it? Possible? With a he-man like you! - Hello, the constable! - Hello. Don't you recognize me? It's me, from the maternity hospital. - Yes of course. - Now it's all over again. - A boy weighing 4.5 kilos. - Congratulations. "The first year was like a dream, but..." Billy! Hurry, it's boiling over. Watch the kids! Sweetie...! Daddy will blow on it. Daddy will blow on it. You can't just leave the kids to fend for themselves! I have to look for the saucepan. I can't do everything at once. It is most important that the children don't kill themselves! You can never be trusted. There, there, sweetie... Oh my, that was awful. The first year was like a dream Forgive me if I was stupid just now. You've nothing to be forgiven for. You're just worn out, that's all. It's not that bad. We have to get serious, and get some help in the house. You don't know what you're talking about. I do. Where do we house domestic help? We take someone with their own place. It'll cost more than half of what you make from translations. Can't be helped. We'll insert an ad. But only a small one. I only have 11 kronor in cash. No one does well with cash on them. Write... "Good place with small family. Vilhelm Westman, 13 Fleming St. 4th fl. They'll be queuing at the door. You think so? - Hello. - Hello. My name is Karlsson. - Is Mr. Karlsson looking...? - Right. - Very well, come in. - Thanks. This is how it looks with us. This is the kitchen. Well, it's bright and pleasant. The kitchen's not too bad at all. Look, what a funny whisk! It's a gas lighter, to light the stove with. Then you just have to step on the gas. Aren't you a bit too old, Mr Karlsson, to consider...? Consider? It's only when you get old that you begin to consider... You misunderstand me. We have three children in the family. I actually had in mind to have a girl. It's not crazy to want a little girl if you have three boys already. It is probably best that you talk with my husband. Billy! Yes? So we have the applicant. If it isn't Hamlet himself! Do you know each other? We know each other from the Karolinska Institute. Hamlet is a caretaker there. Doomed to walk again one day in the dwellings of the unknown. I know Hamlet badly. I must say I've thought of you at times. Is it true you're not thinking of continuing your studies? I've a wife a wife and 3 children, to look after. Medical science can cope without me. That's a shame. You used to have promise. I came up to leave you this book that you forgot. Raber-Copp's anatomy. Thank you very much, that was kind. Yes, I had to come this way. Goodbye. Welcome to us again, if you make a better decision. Now see if the ad is working. You open... a handsome man always makes a good impression. Hello. There's an ad in the paper. - Is the position filled? - No, we have 4-5 ladies to consider. But go on. Vilma Persson. Westman. You do look like a kind and capable person. We'll probably get along well. Marianne? Are there children? Three lovely kids, twin girls. And also a big boy. A small family is alright by me. But no one can stand 3 screaming kids. You heard, right? Our lovely children. You probably weren't her type, Billy. All I'll say is, if there are kids, I won't even think about it. HOUSEMAID Good place in Stockholm A RELIABLE GIRL Experienced at serving If I'm going to take a place, it should be in a family where they have no children. HOUSEMAID Good place in Stockholm I don't want a position where there are so many children! It's hopeless, Marianne. It'll work out. You'll see. People have more children than us, and get by without help. I can't stand to see you toil. Stop looking over my shoulder! Go for a walk instead and take the kids with you. Dear God, help us to get a housemaid. Do it, dear God, for Billy's sake. Sonya! Sonya! Mai, stay here and mind your little brother... ...while Daddy runs after Sonya. Stay here, my big girl. Sonya! Sonya! Sonya, don't you hear Daddy calling? You can't run away from Daddy like that. Mai! No! Thank you, I'm so grateful! I should jolly-well think so! Only a man could behave so stupidly. Thank you so much! If you hadn't been there, Ma'am, there would have been hell to pay! That's for sure. Men should have nothing to do with children. I do tend to limit myself to the smallest possible extent... ...but when there are no longer women who are prepared to deal with children... Not when there are three of them. And with the wife and I working. Come on, girls, let's go. It's amazing how the boy looks like his father. It runs in the family. Who are you really like? Goesta Ekman, I'm told. Yes, I can see that. Though I'd say you were the image of Dr Westman himself. - Dr Harald Westman? - Yes. Are you related perhaps? Slightly. He happened to be my father. Goodness gracious me! Isn't it a small world?! So you're the son of the country doctor? Right. Did you know him? Yes and no... I happen to be from the same area. And here he comes, pushing a pram. Full speed! - I'll take the pram. - Yes, but... No buts, this is women's work. Where do you live? 13 Fleming St. What are you gaping at? Don't you think I know about children even though I'm unmarried? Sure, of course. It's obvious. 13 Fleming St was it. Does he have time to go out with the children? He mostly works at night. It is a habit from the time he studied medicine. He's studied medicine? The money ran out when his father died. So he has to work to help support us. Everyone has to do that. But he still shouldn't have to sacrifice his future. What do you mean by that? His future... But he's very lazy, like many men. Kind of you to take care of the children. But it doesn't allow you to attack my husband. I only say what's what. It's indefensible in a man, who is as gifted as he must be. - He doesn't lack talent. - That's what I'm saying. It's a scandal that he should waste his time on such trash. I've seen the illustrations, that's enough. I appreciate that. I've drawn them. Really? Yes, there are strange ways to make a living nowadays. Miss Karlsson surely didn't come up here, just to say that. Miss Karlsson? Call me Kristin. No, it wasn't just for that. Did you come to apply for the position, Kristin? I'm not applying, I'm taking it. No, but Kristin... You surely don't mean that you'll stay with us? Yes, but I'll live in my own place in town. Of course we'll agree to any conditions. Between 1 and 4, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, I'll be free. Of course we're so grateful that that you'll sacrifice yourself for us. There's no sacrifice, Mrs Westman. It so happens that... ...I'm quite certain that I'll enjoy myself here. Fantastic! She's fine, Billy. She'll get even better, once I've broken her in. From now on, we'll hang this here, on this one. Sure, sure. Of course. The dust rags are now in the cleaning closet... ...and not behind the books on the bookshelf. Well, of course not. By the way, books shouldn't be left lying around. They should be on the bookshelf. That's where we'll put them from now on. We'll tell the children. They must have milk and rusks. Then they won't be so grumpy in the evening. Don't forget that. I'm going now. I'll be back in the morning. Goodbye! Goodbye... Billy, I think we'll forget about breaking her in. Yes... I was just joking, really. There's something strange about this. I agree. Such an orderly person must have a screw loose. It was something else. She never asked about payment. She wants to be free at strange times. To be first in the coffee queue. But that's her business. The old girl's great. Now I'll get some work done. Billy... Do you really think that this is a job for a gifted man? - What do you mean? - This trash. Trash? There are no vacancies for translating the Old Testament. I make an honest living. This is also a cultural work, so it's said. "Why did Mr Buckleton hang himself?" That's something to ponder. Mr Buckleton never hanged himself. That's the point. He spread the rumour. He'd killed an aunt, while everyone thought he… Billy! You must start studying medicine again. "Must"? You with your intelligence and your interest in people. You don't have the right to waste your gifts, as you do. Bang! it says. "Bang"? People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. But you're cute. Although you sometimes have some silly ideas in your head. Yes... He passed anatomy well. Histology also. He probably needs 2 or 3 years. So, is he also talented? Yes, I got that impression. The professors probably got it too. Look... now he can both chew and swallow. If he could, of course. - Who? - Johansson here. To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows... ...of outrageous fortune... ...or take up arms against a sea of troubles. What balderdash are you on about? Balderdash?! Humph! "Hamlet". Third act, first scene. Wasn't it good? Horrible. Shocking beyond measure! "Hamlet". First act, fifth scene. Dear cousin... I'll tell you something,... I've come to the wrong place in life. Have you really? I wouldn't have ended up at the Karolinska Institute. I would have entered the Royal Dramatic Theatre. Are the caretaker positions better there? Incredible thought! Frailty, thy name is woman! "Hamlet". First act, second scene. Herman, do you know what I do? Yes, scratch the back of your head? I'll breathe new life into him. Into Johansson? Into medical student Vilhelm August Westman. Oh yes...! Can't I leave you alone with the kids, without a mishap. What is it now? Sonya enjoys wrecking your anatomy book. It's better for children to play with good books, than bad ones. Anyway, you'll need the book... Me? When you start studying again. - Then you'll need it. - Are we on that again, now? Billy... If you're not smart enough yourself, then I must remind you. You know as well as I do, that we can't afford the money that it costs. That'll be Kristin, will you get the door? Damnation! The coat! I'm coming! I'm coming! Just a moment. - Good morning. - Good morning. I left the key. It didn't matter... we were home anyway. I'm glad you were home. Because there was something I wanted to discuss. That's good, I guess it's about the financial side. Right. It's good that we settle the matter, once and for all. You get nowhere in this world without money. You soon learn that. You don't embark on something new... ...until you know if it's worth it. Obviously. Three kids and a proper family to pay for, when you're getting on. The parent has nothing to do with this. Forgive me for asking... ...but how much can Mrs Westman earn a month? From her sheiks? What do you say, Marianne? 200-300? Yes, something like that, at best. So they pay appropriately. How do you think you'd be able to manage if we said 250? - 250 kronor a month? - Yes. Please Kristin... Did you hear that? She wants 250 kronor a month! Me? I can get by with 50. I'm asking how much YOU need. How much do I need? Yes, to study again and become a doctor. Are YOU going to start with this, too? I know a lawyer Elving... ...who's helped many gifted people to study. I feel certain that he'd help you too. With crippling interest-rates. No one gives money exactly. There doesn't need to be any crippling interest. I don't lend or accept money. Imagine if you could start studying again... Wouldn't that be wonderful? Neither you nor Kristin know what you're talking about. 250 more a month means goodbye to the hanged Mr Buckleton. Wouldn't that be lovely? Finer men than he have lent themselves towards a doctoral degree. Whatever you do, don't say no. No! I'm the one who goes to the lawyer. End of discussion. Lectures start at Karolinska next week. Look who's here! Welcome! How does it feel to start studying again? I can't wait. You'll get through it in no time. I've calculated 2 years to get my M.D. If something is somehow unclear, don't feel embarrassed. Come to me, and we'll work it out. Thanks, I'll remember that. My husband was going for his last examination, he couldn't come himself. I am glad... that he is taking the exam. Now he'll become a medicine candidate. Bring the usual amount for Mrs Westman. It makes me very happy that I got to help you husband. We're very grateful. I assure you that the money will not be wasted. My husband hasn't treated himself to so much as a cinema ticket. Surely his charming wife hasn't gone without less? Nothing worth mentioning. But tonight we intend to make up for it. How? We think we'll let our hair down and go dancing at the Palace. We all need that occasionally. I certainly do... I have to admit. Good for you! Give that to Mrs Westman. - Are you nervous? - One's always a little nervous. It should be OK. My old man knows the professor. They were classmates. He can't fail Johan Rundqvist's son. I'm not that optimistic. So it'll be best if it's you who knocks. Yes, come in. Please be seated. As you gentlemen may know, I usually only pass every other examinee. It's up to you two to agree on who goes first. Sorry, I forgot to say hello from my father, Dr Johan Rundqvist. So he has a son who follows in his footsteps. Then it's perhaps appropriate that the son describes the metatarsal bones... ...to start with. Can Mr Westman tell me... ...what this is called. Sulcus nervi petrosus superficialis majoris. It leads laterally to hiatus canalis nervi facialis. The end of the sulcus is called the internal nervi superficialis minoris aperture. Well now...! I can see that you know your stuff, Mr Westman. So, can Mr Rundqvist tell me... ...in which part of of temporale are these formations? In... pars tympanica. Do you agree, Mr Westman? No, they are in the pars petro mastoideia. That was what I meant. Obviously, they are there. Which "they"? Those formations, of course. Yes, what were they called again? Ulcus. Ulcus molle, perhaps you mean. That's right, ulcus molle! My dear Mr Rundqvist... 'Ulcer molle' is a so-called shameful disease. Science doesn't know of any occurring in the temporal bones. Can I see your exam book, Mr Westman. I guess I could maybe come back some other time? I think you've finally managed to guess correctly, Mr Rundqvist My regards to your dad! So it's got a bit better? Keep going with maximum strength. Yes, the liniment and the cloths. Yes, it's necessary. Do as I say. Follow my prescription. I understand this, after 20 years of practice. Take a sheet and dip in chilled water and re-wrap. Wrap tight, so no air comes out. I'll call tomorrow. What kind of sheets are to be wrapped? Oh, it's you, Mr Westman. - So you passed your exam? - That's right. - Congratulations. - Thanks. What was that about wet sheets? Well? Yes... It was just an acquaintance at the dairy shop. Dairy shop? She'd bought in too much cheese which was getting dry. Then I told her to wrap it in wet cloth. So Kristin is a dairy adviser, on top of everything else? Consultant. It can happen, yes. Will, how did it go? Great! Cum laude, second highest grade. So tonight there'll be a party here. I'm terribly sorry. When I've paid the rent, bills, I have 53.50 left for gas and light. And Kristin gets 50 kronor. I also have money. Yes, yes. 57 cents. It's enough for a cheap cinema. Off we go! The movies can be another time. Now we do as we decided. You two can go out dancing. You can keep my 50 kronor. I'm not in dire need of it right now. As I always say... You're our guardian angel Kristin. It was actually pure coincidence that I'm in town. My bags are packed. I'll be away for 3 months. - Can I get you anything else? - Yes, how much do I have left? - About a quarter of a litre. - Then more punch. And a whisky. - And you Sir? - No thanks, not for my wife either. - You have a tiring job. - Do I ever! Half Sweden's medical staff would be unemployed... ...if there were no lunch breaks. Recently I was in Sundsvall, Hotel Knaust. Lunch ended at 4.30 in the morning. So you've never been to France? You have to see the Riviera in early spring. The Loire Valley and Paris... ...just as the chestnuts have flowered. We can't travel while Billy is studying. But YOU don't study. Travel costs money. We should be able to arrange that matter. We couldn't use your benevolence in such a way, could we? I earned 27,000 last year. Not bad! I could go around the world if I wanted to. But you can't even invite your wife to Katrineholm. What the hell would she do in Katrineholm? It would be an honour to be your guide in Paris... ...if you had no qualms. Why would I have them? Yes, that's right! - And your husband wouldn't object? - Of course not... ...knowing I'm in your safe hands. Then we fly to Paris on the 15th. If your invitation still holds on the 15th of course. A lot of fun, too. Our lawyer's got me flying to Paris with him. A bit different to your idiotic idea about Katrineholm. Katrineholm? I didn't dare go so far as the lawyer. So cheers to having a good time in Paris, Mrs Westman. Paris on the 15th? I'll have a look. That's available. Two tickets on the Paris plane on the 15th. Thank you very much. So you're serious about going off to Paris? Along with Mrs Westman? I can think of worse travelling companions. Only the best will do. You damned playboy! You always manage to get what you want. What do you think Westman feels about it? - Don't get into that. - Alright then. Anyway, if he's so damn stupid, then... I must be off. You mustn't let your Paris affair, make you forget about MY business. Hello. Yes, it's Mrs Westman. But can't you renew the interest this time? No? I'll try to arrange it there. Who was that? I'd quite forgotten the tailor's bill. Today is the last day. He wants 50 kronor. How can we get that? Billy... you're looking most unwell. I AM not! You are! Let me feel... You have a fever. Nonsense... My forehead's always warm. - I think so intensely these days. - Nonsense! You crawl into the cot. I'm going to read. The children are at preschool. You can read in bed. And the tailor? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Come on, I'll tuck you in. Take the envelope to Kristin Carlsson. That dame with the umbrella, eh? I know. 4 Gaffel Lane, 2nd floor. Street door open. Okay! - Can I see Mr Elving? - Of course, Mrs Westman. Go in. - How nice! Welcome. - Thanks. I'm not intruding, am I? Not at all, on the contrary. Have a seat. I was thinking of calling you. I've everything fixed and ready now. For what? For the trip to Paris on the 15th. Don't joke now, Counsel. I don't make jokes about serious things. That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Why is it so crazy? What would happen if you took everything seriously... ...from the dance floor at the Palace? Well I was crazy. I've arranged so that you can write travel letters for newspapers. It's a chance for you to get out in the world... ...and become better-known as an artist. It's very kind of you, but I really should say no. I already have plane tickets and rooms at the Hotel Normandie. I don't understand how you could misunderstand me like that. It's a complete impossibility for me to think of a trip to Paris. If your wardrobe needs to be supplemented... ...it can be arranged. No, of course not. Sorry if that was indiscreet. Well... I'll be frank... - Cigarette? - No thanks. There was a selfish motive behind my proposal. I was thinking of buying some art there. And I thought you'd be a splendid taste-adviser. It's nice that you should think of me, for that. But I still can't consider it. Tell me, Mrs Westman... Is this service in return, so much to ask for... ...after all the favours that I've done you both? We are terribly grateful, but I can't travel. My husband is ill ...and can't be much fun to travel to Paris with a married woman. You can't be unaware that you're a charming woman. No man could avoid being interested in you. I'm no exception. Or... are you just toying with me? Marianne! I'm crazy about you! Let me go! Right now! By the way... Why did you come here today? It was to... It surely wasn't about my regular payment? It's only the middle of the month. Well, it was... The Westman family may not need to borrow any more. Maybe I'll soon be getting my money back. I'll talk to my husband about that. Maybe Counsel will be good enough to let me go now? Maybe Kristin... Gaffel Lane... No.4... Does Miss Kristin Carlsson live here? Yes, why? Do you know if she's in? Have you made an appointment? What? I asked if you'd made an appointment. Appointment? - Isn't this 4 Gaffel Lane? - Yes, it is. Well, thank you. - What was wrong with her? - Seemed to be tongue-tied. There are probably pills for that too, now. COME IN WITHOUT KNOCKING There's a seat here, young lady. Is this a name-day reception? What was that? Is this a name-day reception?! Next, please. Yes, it's the reception room. It can't be helped. I have to talk to her. Calm down my girl... You have to wait your turn. We have waited so long. There must be quiet in the waiting room! Otherwise you can go to the hospital outpatient clinic. You don't want that, I imagine. How's that stomach that was twisting and turning? It gets worse and worse. I can understand that. We're in the middle of the month. How many times, before you're running? - Five, six will be enough. - I can imagine that. The only other thing is to reduce your coffee. Go down to four cups a day. Four cups? Isn't that too few? Four cups, not a drop more. Now we'll put you on to this medicine... The big guns... Westman's patent. So you have a bowl with every dinner, just like blueberry soup. - Can you do that? - Make blueberry soup, I think so. - That will be 3 kronor. - Last time it was 2.25. Pharmacy products have risen terribly lately. Yellow spots on the tonsils. Typical follicular angina. Stay in bed, regular gargling. And light food, of course. Costs nothing. Cost anything? By donation! The moneybox is there. Skinflint! Nothing to thank for... it was so little. Next! Have a seat. No but... Mrs Westman! You didn't expect me. No, I have to admit that. What will the doctor think of me, to know that I'm working as a quack. It was truly a surprise I have to say. But that's not why I'm here. What's happened? My husband is on the last day to pay a bill. We're not getting any more money from the lawyer. That's extraordinary. It's not extraordinary at all. I went to see him. He finally revealed just why he'd wanted to help us. What might that be? In return, he was demanding... certain services... ...from me. I'll leave the rest to your imagination. What a damned rotter! I'll give him a piece of my mind! Sit down... ...and you'll hear about whose money he used for his benevolence. But on one condition... that the doctor never has the faintest idea about it. You can trust me, Kristin. Whose money was it? Mine. My money, every cent of it. Kristin...! I don't understand... Why have you...? Everything has its reason. We'll talk about that later. Hurry. The bank closes in half an hour. Take this and run. I'll not accept any protestations. That's a hundred kronor... I can't pay back... Don't lose sleep over it. Hurry up now. And not a word to your husband. There's one more thing... I maybe a little late for dinner today. I have an important meeting that I don't want to miss. That doesn't matter at all. I don't understand. Here must be a mistake here, Miss Carlsson. You can safely say that. A terrible mistake it was... - when I left my pennies in the hands of a total lout! What did you say? Are you deaf? I said a total lout! Thank you, you don't need to shout. I'm just saying... You ever try anything with Mrs Westman, and I'll fix to have you struck off! And straight to the evening papers! Front page! With photo, and the works. Don't forget it! Billy, how do you feel? Fine. What about the bill? It's all worked out. Did you get an advance from the lawyer? Well... Well, I got it. He's a real brick! Hey! We should invite him over for dinner one day. We can't do that. Can't? It's our obligation. Yes, but you understand that... It's not something we can afford. So we'll get another advance from him! I'll talk to Kristin about it. What does she have to do with this? She thinks she rules the house. Whereabouts is she, by the way? Shouldn't she be getting inner ready? She's certainly a bit late. She takes great liberties. With the amount of work she does, she has a right. Well... I guess you’re right. Rest now, and you'll soon be well Otherwise you'll risk going to hospital. What does Mr Westman find in his patient? The patient's history of acidosis belching and discomfort after eating... ...indicates chronic gastritis with exacerbations. Yes, and chronic gastritis must be treated with dietary prescriptions. You may not use alcohol or tobacco. The diet should be light. All hard-to-digest food should be avoided. You should stay away from lobster, crabs, foie gras, smoked eel and salmon... ...fortified wines and champagne. Understand, doctor, that I've been happily married for 20 years. This has actually never happened before. We all have our weak moments. Isn't that so! I'm not a soul-saver, Sir. - Only a doctor. - Yes, of course. You were lucky. It's just a small one... It'll be gone in a couple of days. I swear it will never happen again. Good. If you have a weak moment again, come not later than 12 hours after. No, that's it. Sorry... Are you open on Sundays? No, we're not. Next! - Good luck, doctor. - Thanks. - Karlsson! - I had to congratulate the doctor. Thanks, Karlsson. Funny that the doctor has become a doctor. Now I'll be worth my keep. I heard that you'd let your apartment. Then you were finished with Ostkoping. It's about starting life as a new doctor. It won't be fun for Kristin to be separated from the family. We'd gladly take Kristin with us, but we hardly have room ourselves. You know yourself the sort of intern accommodation provided by the hospital. Mummy! Mummy! The potatoes are ready. And me too. Yes I am coming. Isn't Kristin coming soon? Mummy's written to Kristin. We'll see. Isn't Daddy coming today either? Yes, he'll probably be home for dinner, I think. Looks like it's going to be a quiet night. I'll go and lie down for a while. You look tired. It's been ages since you had time off. It's been a couple of years. Time flies. Good night, sister. Worked late? Aren't you sleep? No. I need to talk to you. Sonya needs the half sole shoes. You need money. It would probably be helpful. There's not much left of the household allowance. With 150 a month, it's hard for there to be any. I'll talk to the manager tomorrow. Sorry, but I have to sleep now. Good night, darling. I won't bother you anymore with my worries. Pleasant dreams. All the way to 6 o'clock... An eternity. Hello? Yes, I'll tell him right away. It's definitely a difficult case. Thank you, Mrs Westman. - Billy! Wake up! - What is it? - You have to get up. Sister called. - Had to happen. You're no sooner asleep... It's probably too many lunches. It was in Karlstad at the City Hotel... Try to be quiet for a while, if you can. How are you yourself? Good? Yes thanks. Still married? With Marianne? No one else would want me. Pulse seems normal. I don't think we have to operate right away. We'll arrange for him to sleep tonight. Give him 1.5 centigrams of MO. And call me if there's anything. Good night, Sister. - Good night. Sleep tight. - Good night, Billy. What are you doing? You must at least take off your shoes. Haven't I done it? You haven't taken anything off. This is Mrs Westman. Yes...? Well, I'll tell him right away. Sister called. Which sister? Wake up, Billy, The man you examined has got worse. Who was examined? You know very well. Wake up! It may be life-threatening! What is it? Sister called, you have to get up right away. Has he got worse? Madness with 20-hour working days. 21, 22, 23... So are they still married, Billy and Marianne? Although she went behind his back. Just keep counting. Yes... Sure... 26... 27... 28... Sister, know what I'd have done? I'd have punched Elving in the face! Although he takes care of the pennies. 28... 29... 30... His scotched his trip to Paris. But Billy is certainly not the only husband who's been deceived. How is it, doctor? 29... Good. Is the patient sleeping? Yes, the doctor. Scalpel... - You took my coat! - No, it's mine. It's mine, bring it here. Sonya's taken my coat! Stop squabbling! You've taken Mai's coat. So, and your hat. Hurry now, so you're not late. Mum... My cap! Ward 7. Good morning, sister. This is Mrs Westman. Isn't my husband finished yet? Yes, Doctor left a couple of hours ago. Yes, thank you, sister. Thanks, that was all. Where have you been, Billy? I thought something had happened to you. What would've happened? What would've happened to me? You are completely ashen in your face. You can be that sometimes. Something has happened. What is it, Billy? - Answer me, Billy! - It's nothing. Now you're fibbing. I know you too well. It is not so easy to deceive me. But ME! It's not hard! What do you mean? Don't put on an act, it doesn't pay! Are you delirious? I've never been so clear-headed. I was an idiot who didn't understand. Why would he lend me money if he didn't get something for it? Such benefactors don't exist. Have you gone crazy? No, but I have been. You arranged the loan and you collected the money! You asked me to, so that you could work in peace. Yes, and you went! I have been just a pimp! But now it's over, you understand! Finished! Good God, if only Kristin were here. Good morning. Am I intruding? Oh, welcome! You couldn't have come at a better time, Kristin! I thought I'd made a mistake. And ended up in a tempest. My husband thinks there's been something between that lawyer and me. ...because we borrowed money for his studies. Oh yes... I'm well aware that men in general are simple-minded... ...but that Doctor Harald Westman sired a son who's so scatterbrained... That I didn't know. Is he a doctor? Don't you know that? Yes, but a lousy one. It wouldn't have hurt if he'd learned some eye-diagnostics. Look into these eyes... Look as deeply as you can. Have they ever longed for another man... ...then I'm a monkey's uncle. You don't know what I know. It would be amusing to hear what you know. - Come on, out with it. - No. It was a patient. What did he have to say? When I operated last night... So he talked nonsense while he was going under. Nonsense or not... I think I'm going to explode! What your wife says... ...your faithful wife who toiled for you over the years... ...and helped get you to where you are now... What she says means nothing at all... ...against what some poor sod reels out on an operating table. I know Marianne... ...and know what she's stands for. Now it's you who needs to apologise. Turn around! Move! Forgive me, Marianne. It's just that I'm exhausted. That's how it should sound. Now I'm going out to put on the morning coffee. Then I want clarity to how the defense will be. I'll never be a proper doctor. You won't? We'll probably disagree about that. Here is the first copy of my doctoral thesis. You should have it, Kristin, with the dedication I wrote in it. Thank you so much. So this is your first step as a professor. "Psychological cure risks..." It's about "quack psychological conditions". Quackery? Surely not? I think I'm going to faint. Faint? I have to say that... Quackery! Can you become a doctor of quackery as well? No, but it can clarify the psychological conditions. Just let me say this... If there hadn't been quackery... ...you would never have become a doctor. That's very possible. You can safely say... ...that quackery was not without significance for you. Perhaps Without Kristin it wouldn't have been enough. I could never have thought Kristin would put a doctor's hat on me... ...when we met 15 years ago. Never could I have dreamt that country-doctor Westman's son... ...would become a quack professor. Slow down on the slopes... we're not there yet. Did you know it was this he tinkered with at night? I probably had a bit of an idea about it. I didn't want to say anything to you. It would come as a surprise. It sure turned out that way. Have you received the thesis yet? I got the first copy from the bookbindery a while ago. - Where do you have it? - Just a moment. Thanks. Be careful about the book. It is Kristin's dedication copy. - "To Kristin Carlsson..." - "...with thanks for the excellent deed." That's what's in grandfather's gold watch. That's right. They were the most beautiful words I could think of. - So how was Cary Grant? - Terribly charming. You're a touch better. You're a real sheik. Did you hear that, Marianne? You'll never get rid of the sheik. Now all we need is Jan. Where is he? He's at the library, studying. He has history tomorrow. - What's your last name? - Westman. My name's Brukshage. Have you heard of my parents? Tom and Nancy Brukshage. First prize in The Daily News bridge competition 3 years in a row. Aren't I brilliant? Terribly stylish. They've been photographed in all the weeklies. Don't your parents play bridge? Not as far as I know. They don't have time for that. Don't have time! What do they do? Is that your foot I'm stepping on? Yes, but it didn't matter. Don't be childish! Come, let's dance. You hold so loosely. - Who taught you to dance? - My sisters. That's not surprising. Is it the first time you've been out dancing? Yeah. Hold me tighter... I'm not your sister. That's better! No, I think you're blushing! No, it suits you. You must follow me to the gate, but you have to promise not to kiss me. I promise. Just don't promise too much. - We have to dance on Wednesday again. - I don't know if I can afford it. It doesn't have cost much. Surely you can find the money. No, Santa! Hello! Santa is cool. But he's tactless. Tighter, Jan! What terribly long eyelashes you have. On Wednesday, but just you and me. - I'll try to arrange it. - Good, then call me for sure. Don’t bite your nails. Are you nervous, Jan? You're wandering around like a restless spirit. - I have an essay for tomorrow, Swedish. - About what? If I knew, I wouldn't be nervous. Something about the parish. Or about the possibilities of science to make nuclear war more viable. - That should be forbidden for children. - I'm not a child, I'm an adult! It's my hat you're brushing. I didn't recognize it, actually. - Goodness! The kid is wearing a hat. - So keep that in mind! Put it on, so I see how you look. I'm not really used to it. Not slanted so much. Like this. See there. Whoopie-doopie...! How long will you talk to me like I was 4 years old? For me, you are always the little boy, chased into the lake by his sisters. Haven't you learned to put your clothes away, yet? Forgive me, Kristin... Could I borrow a tenner? 10 krona! What are you going to do with it? We were supposed to have a function. No, I can't afford that. Can't afford it? I've heard that all my life. No one can ever afford anything?! Excuse me, Mum, have a moment? Yes, so long as it's quick. Dad is going to do his dissertation tomorrow. I just wanted to ask you if you could help me with something. Sure, as long as it doesn't involve money. - Does it? - Yes, I'd thought... You heard what I said. Bye bye, I must hurry. HOW TO OVERCOME SUPERSTITION PAWNSHOP What can I get for these? 5 kronor. Not more? Can't I get 10 at least? Yes, alright. Today, Vilhelm Westman is doing his dissertation. So it must be polished and nice. I see, but wouldn't it be better to wait with the flowers? He might be rejected. Vilhelm Westman? No way! He knows his stuff. That's just what Karlsson was saying. Oh yes! And thus the native hue of resolution Is sickled o'er with the pale cast of thought "Hamlet", first act, third scene. What are you talking about? It was the third act, the first scene. [PAWN TICKET] Thanks for the chocolate, Kristin. Make sure you aren't late at the hairdresser now. Where did you get the money for the dance last night? Money...? The dance...? I haven't been out dancing. Don't make it worse by lying. Where did you get the money for this ticket? I didn't steal it! What's this pawn ticket for? I just borrowed them. I'll redeem them when I work during the summer holidays. You took them without permission. That's theft! But if you take my hand... and promise never to do it again... ...I'll let need prevail... ...and not say anything to your parents. Do you promise that? I promise. Hello, yes... Westman. I just met your first opponent. Had he found any major faults? It almost seems that way. He insists that you totally misunderstood Schleistoff. That's nice! 1 hour before the defense. I suggest you take Schleistoff with you. Thanks for the tip. I shan't forget it. Thanks. 'Bye. Can you get Schleistoff from the bookshelf. "Wie man den Aberglauben Uberwindet". There are 3 volumes. I keep the pawn ticket, so I'll fix it, Jan. I will pay it back as soon as I start work in summer. Promise not to say anything to Mum and Dad. Kristin Carlsson keeps her word... ...as long as you keep yours. - Haven't you picked up your suit yet? - I was just about to go. Well hurry up! - Was it Scheistoff? - Yes. They're not here. Don't be silly, of course they're there. I looked at them the other day. I'm telling you, they're not here. Who the hell could have taken them? My defense could be at stake. You might have them at the hospital. It must be Kristin, with her damned cleaning. - Kristin! - She's out shopping. Get the door, please. Am I a messenger boy now! - I wonder if Miss Karlsson's here. - No! Why do you want her? It was that liniment. What liniment That Miss Carlsson prescribed for leg pain. It has got much better, so I wanted another bottle. What are you talking about? It must be a mistake. No, I knew Kristin in Gaffel Lane many years ago. This is not Gaffel Lane. I know that. It said consultations were closed due to family celebrations. Then deaf Hanna said... Thank you, that's enough, no quackery here. Marianne! Marianne! What are you screaming about? It's absolutely cursed. I haven't taken the books. And what about Kristin! What? I'm going crazy! Kristin is nothing but an out and out con-woman! What nonsense are you talking? She won't stay with us a minute longer! You are irritated and nervous. You can do the defense without Schleistoff. How can I keep a cool head when I know that Kristin is a quack? Can you figure it out? Our own blameless little Kristin? The wise old lady of Gaffel Lane. Really? Is that all you have to say? I'll be the laughing stock of the medical profession, if this gets out. Did you see 3 thick books on the bookshelf? - What were they called? - Schleistoff it said on the backs. Must the doctor have them now? His entire defense may depend on it. You haven't seen them? Well... No! - No I haven't. - Think really carefully. You might have them at Gaffel Lane. What do you do there, by the way? - Heavens! I live there. - And be a quack. While you play guardian angel. Do you understand the harm you've done? Harm? - I've helped sick people. - On their way to the cemetery! Some may have ended up there as well. But there if that happened, it was the Lord's will. There's a burial chapel at the hospital, too. Do you realise you make me the laughing stock of the medical profession? We don't have time... you have to get dressed. Can I do my dissertation after this? Kristin can do it. She knows the psychological conditions. Flowers? Yes, I thank you. "All the luck and success. May it become a professorship." "Warmly and sincerely, wishes Kristin." That professorship is something we'll agree about. We shall, yes. My words fly up, My thoughts remain below. Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Let's drop Hamlet right now. As you wish. My finger on my lips, good lord. What follows is silence. Curtain falls slowly. Pull yourself together. You have to get dressed. Leave me alone. - Here's the suit, Mum. - Put it on the chair. There's no way you've seen 3 thick books of Schleistoff? Schleistoff? Books...? Didn't you hear what Mum said? So answer the question! Do you need them, Dad? Otherwise I wouldn't ask. Do you know where they are? Well... I've borrowed them. Borrowed them? Why on earth would you want them? I didn't think you had any use for them. What are you talking about? - It's just that... - What? I needed money for something. So you sold them? Do you not understand what you have done? Sell dad's books! I haven't sold them. What have you done? I just hocked them. It gets better and better. Not only do we have a quack in the house. We have a thief too! Well, where's your pawn ticket? Or have you sold it too? No, Kristin has it. Kristin! Is she involved in this now too? Here are the books. I'd put them in the attic when I was cleaning. Well, there's nothing more for me to do. I have so much to thank for the years I've been here. I don't understand anything. What reason do you have for telling us you'd done that? Reason? There must be some reason. It was the country doctor's great sorrow... ...that he never got the chance to do his dissertation. What do you have to do with that? It's very simple. The old doctor saved my mother and me from being auctioned off. 15 years before you were born. Auctioned off? Exactly. Just like in a slave market. It was like that in the good old days. I've never forgotten that help. And so you have... ...tried to make a small repayment. As far as my finances have allowed. You don't mean that...? That it was your money we borrowed from Elving? There's no point in making a secret of it any longer. Now that you know everything about Gaffel Lane. I am very grateful. But I cannot defend a thesis which has been paid for by quack money. Quack money? Oh yes, there's probably a bit of chatter here and there. Things are either approved by the D.A.A. or not. We should not argue about that. We shall! Is it more quackery about me prescribing blueberry soup for diarrhea... ...than if a doctor should do it? Would I prescribe blueberry soup? I don't know. But Dr Westman did, when I was with him. At my father's? Yes, for 12 years. His recipe is still good today. I've not used any others. I know that when you have pains, a doctor must be called. Even if it costs a lot more. No doubt you get paid as well. Not at first, doctor. But after you started studying, I added 50 cents to the blueberry soup. My God... Here I stand with my psychological conditions... ...for the fight against quackery. I don't want to hear another word. That you call your father's honest recipes quackery. There's a difference between quack and quack. Now get off to your defense... ..and deal with the real quacks. Put on your coat... and I'll call for a cab. Go on... off you go!
