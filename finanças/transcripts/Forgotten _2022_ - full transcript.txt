(thudding) (ethereal music) (somber music) [Black] Now the life of a detective? (scoffs) It's not an easy one. Especially for those closest to them, right? My beautiful wife tolerated the long hours and the loneliness, because she knew how important the job was to me. Even when I was home, I brought my work with me, staying up all night, poring over evidence, trying to crack the case. My wife would ask me what I was working on and I'd say I'll tell you when I've solved it, you know, but then one day she was gone, and I never got to tell her about most of them. There was one case in particular. If she was here, if I was able to tell her about it, she'd probably tell me what she always told me, that some things are meant to be forgotten.

You want a smoke? Yeah, no, those things will kill you. When you're old and gray, who cares by then? So you gonna go attend to them little girls? They'll be fine. Oh yeah, you certainly can tell a lot about a man by the contents of his wallet, and I know that's what you want. [Becky] Yeah, you gotta pay to get all this. I bet you do, and I want all of it, too. (both giggle) (baby coos) (foreboding music) How old are your kids, girl? Huh? - Nine months. - Huh? - Why? Making conversation. All right, no more games. Well, what's the hurry, come on. I got things to do. Aw, like what? Look after them two brats, huh? I know it must be hard, looking after both of them by yourself all the time. Why do you keep asking about my babies, huh? I'm just talking. I mean, I'm just talking, all right? Just talking, trying to get to know you better, shit! Look, you fucked me, now pay me. Whoa. Not to me. Easy with that language, not to me. What's the going rate these days, huh? 200. How much is going in your arm, how much going to your kids, huh? Just stay out of my fucking business and pay me! I said to watch your goddamn language, you fucking bitch! - All right, it's... - All right? Just get out, it's on the house. Well, that's mighty big of you. All the stinky whores are meth addicts! (tense music) But you, but you're not a, you're not a stinking whore, are you? - Please leave. - You're not a stinky whore, no you're not. I mean, you are a whore, but... (sniffs) You smell real good. Please, I have to go see my girls. Oh, really? So, uh... (Becky gasps) Now you wanna play mommy, huh? When I was flashing this cash in your face, you didn't give a shit about them little brats, did you? (babies coo) [Becky] They need to be changed. Hey, I wanna play a game. I wanna play a game. You like games, bitch? "Let's Make a Deal"? You ever see that TV show? Huh? No, yeah, you were too young, huh? Well anyway, great fucking TV show! Yeah. Will you please leave? You hurt my feelings. You hurt me. Now here I am trying to have fun! And trying to be a nice person and get to know you better, and you, you go on and kick me out of your room? Your mother never told you nothing about no good manners? Huh? [Becky] Get out of my house. Get the fuck out of my house! No. (Becky gasps) Now you've been a good girl, okay? Now you take it like you mean it now. Now here I am, trying to be nice to you, and you, and you insult me? Huh, huh? You know you can't handle two baby girls. I'm just trying to lighten the load, you dumb whore. Now, my wife wants a child. But she's too ugly and disgusting for me to fuck! So buying one is the only way. So shut the fuck up, it's gonna be okay. (Becky whimpers) Shush it. (shushes) It's okay. I don't want to hear... Right. Now just say okay, and it'll be okay. Say okay. Say okay. Say it! - Okay, okay. Okay. (babies coo) (foreboding music) (Becky gags) (Mike shushes) (suspenseful music) (neck cracks) (Mike breathes heavily) Son of a bitch. Look what you made me go and do. Get all sweaty and shit after a shower. (water patters) (man grunts) (tense music) (baby coos) Hey, kinda cute, yeah. Except for the crying and the crack-addicted, cracked out hooker for a mother. (baby cries) There you go. (shushes) Okay. Time to go. (tense music) (shushes) Be quiet. Come on now. Well look at that. You missed your sister. (chuckles) Oh hell. Two for the price of one. Let's go. All right, I'm a daddy now, isn't that something? (suspenseful music) (foreboding music) (dark whimsical music) (upbeat music) [Waitress] Hey, darlin', what can I get ya'? Oh, tea. [Waitress] Sure thing, what kind? Earl Grey, thanks. And? [Stacy] Just the tea. Honey, you sure you don't want something to eat? We got a special today on chicken a la king. Just the tea, thanks. You know, he's not worth it. I'll be back with your tea. Here you go, dear. Thanks. [Waitress] No problem. (melancholy music) (door closes) [Brad] You love me, Stacy, I know you do. I tried to meet you halfway. I gave you your space. Next thing I know, you're sneaking off to live with someone else? Moved in with a roommate you barely know to get away from me? That hurts, Stacy! Why you always trying to hurt me? (Stacy gasps) - Oh, no, that's okay. - It's on me. That's very sweet, but... Don't worry about it, I've been there too. We girls gotta stick together. Thanks. (upbeat country music) Thank you. You are such a cutie. I bet you have a smile somewhere in there. (chuckles) That's more like it. Do you happen to know how to get to Mount Falls? My GPS doesn't work. Mount Falls? I'm not sure. Herbert! Do you know where Mount Falls is? Uh, yeah. You, uh, take 67. No wait, 68 north, 'til you get to Alvarado. Then you just keep going, it's way up in the mountains. Yeah, Mount Falls, sounds familiar. I think I heard something about it on the news. Murder suicide, years ago, whatever. You need anything else, honey? No, thank you for the breakfast. You're welcome. (phone rings) Hello? [Stacy] Kel. Stacy? Stace, where are you? No, I can't tell you. Seriously? No, where did you go? Okay, you are not just a rent check, you are also a friend. Look, I'm gonna be a few days, just, maybe a week, I'm not sure. Can you just feed Misty for me? Don't worry, I'll feed your dog, but what is going on? No questions, please. Okay, I just need a few days to think, and I'll call you, I promise. (sighs) I am worried about you, Stacy, okay? And so is your boyfriend, who has been calling nonstop, by the way. He has no idea where you are either, you should really give him a call. Don't talk to Brad. [Kelly] What, why? He's your boyfriend. Just please don't, okay? I just need a few days to myself, just me time. Okay, just... Will you tell me where you're going at least, so I'm not worried? A cabin in the mountains. It's my uncle's old place. Oh, up at Big Bear? Well, at least it's pretty. No, not Big Bear, this place called Mount Falls. [Kelly] Where the fuck is that? San Bernardino. Oh, in the sticks? Look, I gotta go, can you just feed Misty? What, wait, wait, what am I supposed to tell Brad? - Okay. - Stacy! (dramatic music) (birds tweet) [Woman] There you are, Detective Black. - Thank you. - Hey, man, what's up? [Detective] Oh, you need to watch those calories, old man. Yeah, well you need to watch your mouth, young 'un. Respect your elders. Uh, I'm sorry sir, I... I'm just messing with you, kid. Black. Yeah? - Can I see you when you got a minute? Sure, Cap. (phone rings) So what's up, what are you doing this weekend? Hello? [Peter] Detective Black? [Black] Yes. [Peter] Yeah, this is Peter Richards. The one that lives in the trailer home outside town. Okay? [Peter] You gave me your business card? Could I ask you what this is in reference to? [Peter] Listen, the trailer home I live in is the same one that girl and her babies went missing. You were here five years ago asking questions, I kept your card. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember you. How are you? - Good. You're gonna be missed. [Peter] Listen, I was replacing the wiring underneath my porch yesterday, and I think I may have found something. - Something? - Yeah, something. Items, belonged to that girl. Has to be, 'cause it ain't mine. You wanna come see them? Listen, can I talk to you tomorrow? I'm kinda in the middle of something right now, let me get your number. Hey Cap. Hey, have a seat. (door closes) So... (Black grunts) What, 25, 27 years? 35 years. 35 fucking years. So, now that you've got all this freedom, what are you gonna do? I dunno, fishing? I haven't figured it out yet. I love to fish. All that fresh air. Don't have to deal with the daily bullshit, you know? Here we go. Here's to you, my friend. To a new life. (Captain groans) You know, Cap, I was thinking that maybe I should come back and work with the old retired detectives on those cold cases. Why? I mean, jeez, you haven't even enjoyed your retirement yet, you're already talking about coming back to work? Listen, take my advice, all right? I'd forget about being a detective. You're a civilian now, do what civilians do. You work in the yard, okay? You go to the movies. Golf, do some golfing. But leave this crazy life behind. All right, I know that look. What's the case, Black? The Becky Comfort case. You know, missing mother and children? Yeah, I know the case, Black. And you know that there's no evidence in that case. [Black] Well, that's true. What? You know, Becky Comfort's sister, Mrs. Meeker, came to see me last month. Yeah, not that crazy bitch again. Listen, what did her psychic have to tell her this time? Now granted, she's persistent but, you know, I've got to admit that we didn't give it the attention it deserved. What are you trying to say, Black? Wait a minute, you wanna, you wanna continue to work on that case? Well you can't. You're retired. Okay, come on. All right, look, we're friends. I'm not trying to be an asshole, but what is the point? There were no bodies in that case. You need a body to make a case. Jesus Christ, Black. You're the boss. I envy you, Black. Wish I could retire. Take a vacation, Black. You know I don't do vacations. I don't want to see you snooping around this office looking for detective work. I'll have you shot on the spot. I'll, hell, I'll do it myself. Listen, you need to turn in your badge and your gun to personnel. (foreboding music) So it, what, it was a hit and run. (detective chatters) (tense music) Good luck, Black. Same to you, kid. (ethereal ethnic music) What is this shit we are listening to? I had the worst day. My boss is such a bitch. Chris! Are you listening to me? Kel, you gotta read this. This is something special, this is... [Kelly] Babe, you know I hate books. No, I think that you would learn a lot about yourself. This is like, there's this whole system, you know, for, for stimulation, and, and you need more stimulation, I gotta be honest. Because the reality TV, I think it's rotting your brain a little bit. I'm worried about Stacy. You know, she didn't sound like herself at all. Why doesn't anybody open up to me? Well, maybe because you're a drama queen, baby, and you kinda blow little things out of proportion. You know what, fuck you. I love you too, sweetie. (doorbell chimes) I can do this. Oh, no, by all means, let me get it. - What? - Nothing. Just read your fucking book. Hi. - Hi. - Brad, hey! Is, uh... Is Stacy here? [Kelly] No. Come on in. Hey man, what up? - What's up, bro? - Wow, I haven't seen you in a while. Where is she? Um, she is on vacation. Vacation? Yep. (chuckles) She went on vacation and left this dog? She wouldn't go anywhere without this dog. She told me to take care of her. I gotta find her. Where'd she go? I promised I wouldn't tell. I see. Dude, are you crying? Cause you know you're not supposed to puss out in front of a chick. - Chris, shut up! - Well, he's crying. It's, come here, come here, come here, come here. It's okay. (sighs) Okay, hey man, don't get too comfortable. That's my girlfriend that you're hugging. I'm sorry, it's just... We had a little disagreement last night, and I wanted to come over and smooth things out. Guess she doesn't want to see me. I'm sorry. [Brad] Sorry to ruin your afternoon, I'll go now. See ya. [Kelly] Wait. I know where she is. Really, you do? Yeah, well, I know the area. Where, I'll go and surprise her. She is in a small town called Mount Falls, somewhere in San Bernardino? Thank you. Wait, Brad, I want to come with you. Why? Yeah, why? Because she's a friend and I'm worried about her. Plus, I am gonna get in so much trouble for telling you, so I'm gonna have to defuse that bomb before she gets back to the apartment, so... I think we need some time alone. Oh, I'll give you guys your space, I just, I wanna be there, you know, for moral support. Bullshit, you just wanna be nosy. Again, shut the fuck up, Chris. Just saying. I mean, is there any reason why you wouldn't want me to be there? Grab your coat. Okay, I'll go pack my things. Um, excuse me, sorry. What about the, the dog? I will take her down the street to Ms. Dover's. She's got like 10 dogs, shouldn't be a problem. Good? You get packed, I'll wait for you in the car. Okay. Okay, come on, Chris, help me pack some things. (chuckles) Help you pack? Help me pack, 'cause I'm coming too. [Kelly] Why? 'Cause I'm not leaving you in a car with Brad Pitt there. Are you serious? I'm just going to help a friend. Yeah, I don't care, okay? Look at him. Left alone, long enough, I'd probably try to fuck him, Kel. (serene guitar music) Whatever, hurry up. ♪ Amazing how one person can hurt his self ♪ ♪ Even though the pain is so familiar, and you know ♪ (phone rings) ♪ It's just the same old ♪ ♪ Same old ♪ (upbeat pop music) (police radio chatters) (upbeat pop music) Hi. [Stacy] Hi. So where you headed to, young lady? Um, my uncle's cabin. Why, did I break the law? Oh, no, not exactly. All right, then. [Officer] Which cabin? It's none of your business. Can I see your license, please? I can't believe this. You know, no one should be alone in these parts. Really? I mean, I'm just going to my uncle's cabin. [Officer] What's your uncle's name? Stanley Dovic. Dovic cabin? Why do you wanna go there? Call it a vacation. [Officer] Well, you know we've had some issues with people disappearing in these parts. That sucks. Hikers and such, just lost people in the woods. Well, some people say these parts may be haunted. Thanks for the warning. I'll be okay. You going alone? I think so. I mean, are you meeting anybody at the cabin? A boyfriend? Yeah, meeting my boyfriend. [Officer] Okay, just want to make sure pretty girl like you is protected. Thanks. Okay. You be careful up there, little girl. I will. Old man. There it is. Now I didn't touch anything. I know, I watch all those crime drama investigative shows. You know, they normally finish up those shows in about an hour. How long you been working on this? (foreboding music) (chuckles) And why you suppose she hid it in there? [Black] She probably didn't want her mother to see it. [Peter] Her mother? Yeah, she was coming over at three o'clock to babysit the twins while Becky went shopping. [Peter] What happened, she's a no-show? No. By the time she got here, Becky had already gone missing. You mind if I keep this box for evidence? Oh hell, I don't care, I'm cleaning out down there anyway. - Great. - You sure that's all you need? Well, if you find anything else, give me a call, you got my number. All right, if you need any extra help, I'm always here. Nah, that's all right. Thanks very much. All right, take care, keep me in mind. (eerie music) Hey! (babies coo) You're home. You've been gone all day. I know. Guess what I've got for you. Ta-da! Babies? Where did you get them? Never mind about that, now, no big deal. [Claudia] Where, Mike? They fell off a truck. Mike. (lighter clicks) You can't smoke in front of babies. Look, bitch, I'm a man, I can do whatever the fuck I want, all right? What do we do with them? Well, I figured we'd keep one and sell the other. What? There's money in, in that shit. No! You can't do that. Why not? You can't separate twins, it's bad luck. Bullshit, I need the extra cash. Bullshit. You have $500 in your wallet. With all that money... - Shut the fuck up. Shut up, the money is my business! Damn it. (whimpers) (baby coos) Look at me. The things I do for you. We don't need anyone else now. Just the four of us. You must feel like a queen right about now, huh? Hi. What do you say? What do you say? - Thank you. - You're welcome. (Mike chuckles) Do these babies belong to one of your sluts? (Mike grunts) Maybe, maybe not, does it matter? Come on now, just shut up and enjoy these little brats. When I said I wanted babies, I meant I wanted us to have them together. Well, it got a little late in the game there, girl, okay? A little late, and my dick is for fucking not breeding. I always wanted a baby. Never thought I'd get two at the same time. Well, just think of it as a, you know, a Christmas bonus, or me being nice twice. [Claudia] I hope she don't come around and make trouble. It's a small town, people talk. You're right though, people will talk, those fuckers. Luckily, we got ways to make them shut the fuck up. What are you gonna do, Mike? The best thing to do is stay on the safe side. That means these two will never leave the house, okay? It's best if they stay in the basement. Got it? Sure. Okay, I'm gonna get me some shut-eye now. (Claudia shushes) (gentle music) ♪ Hush-a-bye baby ♪ ♪ The angels are near ♪ ♪ Smiling upon you ♪ ♪ There is nothing to fear ♪ ♪ Mommy's arms keep you warm ♪ ♪ Don't you shed a tear ♪ (ominous music) [Mike] I told you, those brats need to keep quiet. (shushes) Hey, hey, hi. [Mike] Look at me. I won't tolerate no crying, Claudia, hurry up. ♪ Hush-a-bye, baby ♪ [Mike] You don't need to spoil them. (shushes) Okay, everything's gonna be fine. (shushes) Okay, you're good, you're safe. (foreboding music) (lock clicks) (gentle music) [Stacy] Running away. I feel that here is hope for the first time in a long while. I feel like I can think for the first time, without people telling me what to think. Thoughts are constantly coming to my mind. The past seems so far away, yet still somewhat present. Should I go back or stay away? Away from everyone and everything. I can't believe I'm writing this. (foreboding music) Being back in my uncle's cabin takes me back to when I was a kid. Away from my father. Here's where I used to think about the mother I never knew. (owl hoots) (tense music) [Girl] Mama? Where did she go? Mama? (clattering) Who is that? (tense music) (serene piano music) [Black] How are you, Mrs. Meeker? All right. I've got three names here. Let's see if they mean anything to you. Matt Warren. Mike Gillis. Ken Bruce. No. Is that all you got? Three names? For now, yeah. It's hard at first when you have nothing, but as I investigate, I hope to find more that'll lead us down the right path. Nothing is the appropriate word here. That's all you and the cops have done for years. Nothing. Well, I think we did the best we could, based on the circumstances. Bullshit. So you and your fellow officers still think I'm crazy? Nobody said you were crazy. You didn't have to. I saw how you looked at me when I brought my friend in to help. She's a gifted psychic, she knows things. I have a missing, probably dead, sister. No, your sister probably skipped town, because of her, well, profession. She was a known prostitute, and it's hard to keep tabs on those kind of people. So whores and children of whores aren't worth finding? I didn't mean it that way. I know what you meant. Now look, I'm the only one that thinks there's any more to this case. Everyone at the precinct gave up on it years ago. Now if you want my help, I'll help you, but I would appreciate not being treated like your enemy. So what's it gonna be? Find my sister and my nieces. (melancholy music) (phone rings) (sighs) Hello? Hey, John. How the hell are you, you old goat? So, you're finally one of us now. So how do you like retirement? (chuckles) I can take it or leave it. Hey, bud, I got a favor to ask you. Could you look up a few guys for me? People of interest? You ready? People of interest? You mean like a real case? Man, I haven't done that in years. Why don't you call your old precinct? Eh, let's say I wanna be discreet. Oh. I don't think you completely grasp the concept of retirement, Black. Okay, I, uh, I still know some people still on the force over there that owe me a ton of favors. Okay, what's the names? Matt Warren. Mike Gillis. Ken Bruce. All right. I'll see what I can find. Yeah, thanks, buddy, I owe you. Yeah, okay. Take care. (melancholy music) (gentle music) [Stacy] What was it that I saw last night? It must be my nerves. The park ranger warned me about this place being haunted. Was it a ghost or just my imagination? Has to be my nerves. I need to deal with Brad when I get back. I wish I didn't love him so much. Love, if that's what you call it. Then when you cover your bruises with make-up and wear a scarf around your neck, everything looks all too normal. Yesterday I looked in the mirror and that was all I saw, was just bruises. And this time I didn't want to cover them up. I'm taking a really good look at myself. How could he? I wanted to keep it. Brad called it an accident, I can never forgive him for that. (girl laughs) Come on! (horn honks) Move it! (upbeat rock music) [Kelly] Wow, this is a tiny town. [Brad] Fucking Mayberry. I like small towns. Heart of America. You've never been outside of the city. Yeah, I read about them, Kel, in books, and they seem nice. Okay, I have questions. How long have you guys actually been dating, and why don't you ever come to the house? Stacy doesn't tell me anything. I like to remain mysterious. I like that. You know, you two didn't have to come with. I can handle my girlfriend. Handle her? Okay, the only one who can handle Stacy is Stacy. [Chris] Babe, let it go. No, I'm sorry, Brad, but Stacy is a grown woman. You don't handle shit. You're fighting a losing battle on this one, dude. Yeah, just tune her out, and sometimes it goes away. "It goes away?" (scoffs) Oh, it'll be going away for you, buddy. You are not getting any tonight. Look, Stacy and I have been going out for six years now. We've had our ups and downs like every couple. I am the luckiest guy to have a girl like her. She should be lucky to have you. It must be nice to have a true friend like you to stick up for her. - I'm thirsty. - There's a park ranger. Maybe he can help us out. [Brad] Hey, excuse me. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you. Actually, I'm kinda lost, I'm looking for someone. She might have stopped here yesterday. - She? - Yeah. You probably haven't seen her, but long dark hair, 25 years old, driving a gray sedan? Yeah, there was a girl. - Yeah? - Yeah, she, uh, said she was heading up to her uncle's cabin. Yeah, that's her. Oh. You must be the boyfriend. Yeah, yeah, I am the boyfriend. (foreboding music) (tense music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (hiker gasps) [Hiker] Oh god, no! (Hiker yelps) (chuckles) You know, I talked to Maggie Meeker the other day. - Maggie Meeker? - Yeah. That old bitch still around? Yeah, I gotta admit, she is persistent. Persistent? Try obsessed. There's a thin line between that and persistent. Look, what if it was my family member? Lost for years without a trace, wouldn't you want to know the truth? Yeah, but this is not your story, Black. (gentle lounge music) What happened to us, Burke? We became cops to help people. To right the wrongs in the world, huh? When did we become so jaded? The day I finally realized that the system is crooked, and good guys always end up last. Yeah, well, I don't wanna be the bad guy, I wanna see what I can find. What's that? That info you wanted. Oh shit, if the captain finds out I've been sniffing around the Becky Comfort case, he'll have a shit hemorrhage. (Burke chuckles) Where'd you find this? I got a friend still on the force over in Hander County there, he checks criminal records. Well, what do you got? Ken Bruce, 39 years old, five prior drug convictions, married with 5 children. Mike Gillis, assault and battery in '79, domestic abuse in '85. Model citizen. (Burke chuckles) According to our records, never had children, never married. Matt Warren, 44 years old. No criminal record, no prior arrests. Married, two kids, both boys. [Black] Choir boy. Do you know where I found that photo? [Black] Where? Uh, a WWW dot, face, tweety, uh, dot com or something. [Black] Times sure have changed. (melancholy music) Thank you, honey. That was a long time ago. We were married at the time. I was young, stupid, I'm not proud of what I did. My wife doesn't need to know about this. Well, I guess now we go see Mike Gillis. Oh, I don't think he'll help us much, he's dead. - What? - Oh, I didn't tell you? Oh yeah, he's been dead. Do you at least have his last known place of residence? Oh yeah, it's a little town called Mount Falls. Oh. (foreboding music) (fire crackles) [Cassie] What is he doing? Burning the bad mans again. (ominous music) (foreboding music) I'm hungry! (door opens) Good, huh? [Girls] Yes, Daddy. Hey, what did I say? Don't call me daddy now. There is no daddy, right? Where's Mommy? Haven't seen Mommy in a long time. (sighs) She had to go. Didn't love us no more, didn't love me anymore, and uh... I thought you two could make her stay, but she said she was gonna leave, and I, see, I couldn't let that happen, and this way, we can have all have a piece of her. I mean... I didn't say to stop eating. I want Mommy. Too late, eat up. Oh, come on. Hey. You two sit down and finish your food. We're not hungry. Sit down. And you, young lady, you need to think about your nourishment now. Think about them poor starving kids over there in, uh, Africa, huh? Think about them. And it's not like you've never not eaten somebody before. Right? Now, there is no mommy! Sit down and finish your meal. Listen to me, young lady, I'm being serious now. Do you want me to beat you? Because I will beat you, and then I will sell you. Sorry, Mike. You can't do this to us. Well, you know what would happen if people could see you? They would kill you and then eat you, because you're bad little girls! All right? Now, I'm the best friend you will ever have, and I would hate to see anything, anything bad happen to either one of you, but if you're against me, I can't protect you. Okay? It's okay. Now you be good girls and finish your meal, okay? Or you're gonna end up like your mommy. (birds chirp) (dramatic music) Hey. We got company. Greetings. Hi. Sorry, I didn't know anyone was living up in these parts. Oh, well, we're not really here. Wink, wink. Here, but not there. We don't get many visitors around here. Oh, well, I just got here actually. I'm staying a few miles north, my uncle has a cabin. [Sal] Don't you just love being with nature? I do. Oh, you should come chill with us for a bit. Have a drink of water. Come, come. Take your bag off, you know? Chill for a while. Here you go. Thanks. Ever go to Burning Man? No, can't say that I have. Oh, we're going in August. This'll be our sixth time? You should totally go, you'd love it. - Here. Oh, no thanks. That's cool. Do you guys notice anything strange about the forest at all? (laughs) What, what's so funny? [Sal] Nothing, nothing. Well, the park ranger said they were haunted. I don't know. That's what they say. Some people say they hear the voice of a little girl. God bless her. We wouldn't have this operation here if it wasn't for the ghost. Amen. Whole town is just scared shit less. So, the park ranger's telling the truth? Old Phil? Man, he's more chicken-shit than the rest of them. Well, I heard this little girl, like screaming, "Where is my mommy?" I swear. - No shit? [Stacy] Yeah. Yeah, some people say that some weird shit did happen back in the day. Who says that, and what happened? They say a guy living in the woods kept his daughter locked up, never let her leave the house. I also heard some people say there were two girls. It just depends on who's telling the story. (gentle rock music) (groans) Hello Mike! I never thought I'd run into you. How in the hell are things? So, this is where you live, huh? Home sweet home. Got a reason for being here, Bill? Well, I'm afraid I'm a little lost. I was hunting and took a wrong turn. Got some meat on the grill, you hungry? No, I'm good, got it covered. You alone? [Bill] Just me, myself and I. I see. How's Claudia? (foreboding music) [Mike] She's fine. I haven't seen you two around the store in a while. Murray says he hasn't seen Claudia for years. Was just asking about her the other day. - Uh-huh? - Yeah. Murray ought to mind his own fucking business. Nah, don't take it like that. He was just curious why he never sees you in the store anymore. Well, don't need the store no more. Everything we need is right here in nature. [Bill] I see. But if Murray needs to know my business, who am I to say he can't? She left me. What? Claudia, she ran off with my best friend. Ah man, I'm sorry to hear that. Ain't that a kick in the teeth? Bitch broke my heart. Broke my heart, and... What can you, whores will be whores. What can you expect, you know? I never known a woman to treat a man right, right? Sure, that's right. What can you expect? I mean, broads have been treating me like shit my whole life, even my own mother. My own mother. Leave me alone with a stranger, so she could go off and get high. - I'm sorry about that too. - Cunt! Fucking cunt. Wow. I, I'm really sorry to hear about that, Mike. Thanks, but, hey. When life gives you lemons, you make... - Lemonade. - That's right. That's what I did. I own this whole thing. It's got everything I need. You know, Bill? I don't need no one. Except your kids, right? (ominous music) (Mike chuckles) My kids? Yeah. Yeah, your kids, Murray said that Claudia used to come into the store and buy kid's clothes. Two of everything, girls to be exact. You got daughters, right? Why, you know, you should bring them over to my house. We got a swimming pool, I betcha the girls would love that. (Mike sighs) They were her kids, Bill, from a previous marriage. I never did get close to them, so when she left me, they were all gone. Oh, well, that answers why we haven't seen Claudia around, then, right? Hey, stay for dinner. (tense music) Nah, I really better get back into town. If I don't get back into town soon, my missus will call out a search party for me. (chuckles nervously) You take care. (tense music) See you around, Mike. (truck engine revs) (suspenseful music) ♪ Hush-a-bye, baby, angels around ♪ (girls laugh) ♪ Hush-a-bye, baby, angels ♪ (girls laugh) ♪ Hush-a-bye, baby, angels ♪ (girls laugh) [Mike] Girls! ♪ Hush-a-bye, baby ♪ [Mike] Quiet! You girls are no good. Do you know what people will do if they see you? They will kill you, and then they will eat you, 'cause you're bad little girls. I'm the best friend you have. Do you girls want another beating? (glass shatters) (tense music) Oh no. (banging) Hey! Hey! (girls cough) No, no, no, no! What'd you do? Girls... - Take the keys! - Oh no... - Lock the door! Hey. (girls cough) Hey, honey. What, what's that, girls? Hey. (girls cough) I hit my head... (suspenseful music) Girls? It's hot in here. Hey, Daddy needs help! It's hot! Girls, help me! (girls scream) [Judy] But the only thing certain, that guy was crazy. He tormented anybody that crossed him. Oh, then I heard he shot his wife and daughter. (sighs) Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Then he set the house on fire, murder-suicide. Some people say the wife killed the family, it just depends on which story you hear. How long ago was this? 10 years. And the little girl's spirit still roams the woods! Woooo! Up until 10 years ago, the area was a popular camping and hunting area. And it's the kind of tall tale that keeps people from poking around. That's why we're here. Oh. Don't want nobody stumbling upon our magic garden. (Stacy chuckles) Boo! Does this scare you? No, it's a toy doll. Yeah, we have her just in case we run into unwelcome visitors. (chuckles) Her name's Britney. Hi. Well, what I saw was real, and it scared the shit out of me. I guess a lot of people feel the same way. You guys don't believe me. Well, we've never seen or heard a ghost girl, and we've been up here for a while. (sighs) It's getting late, I gotta go. But thank you so much for... Oh. You should spend the night! [Stacy] No, I've already put you guys out too much. We have an extra sleeping bag. Yeah, it's totally cool. No, it's no bother. We like nice people. Who wants to spend the evening alone? Well, I wouldn't recommend it. I mean, you lose the sunlight and get lost, there's no telling where you'll end up. See, just spend the night here with us and we'll help you get back in the morning. - Yeah. - Hm? Okay, sure. - Mm, all rightie. - All right. Yeah. We need to, we need to, we need to... Food, make food. Yeah, we're gonna make some food in a bit and, um... [Sal] Hungry? (foreboding music) [Girl] Where's Mommy? They're coming to get me. I see the mean mans. They will hurt me. I'm scared. (Stacy gasps) Judy, Judy, Judy? Did you hear that? [Judy] What, what is it? [Stacy] I heard the voices. Sal! Stop with the practical jokes! Don't scare our guest! You're all right, it was just a bad dream. (melancholy music) And I'm gaining experience, and soon, level 38 here I come. The whole, you know... - You're a geek. [Chris] It's amazing. [Kelly] Hey! What the hell are you doing here? We're having breakfast, silly. Want some? You brought Brad? Hi Stacy. Kel, I told you I wanted to be alone. Hi baby. Why are you all here? We were worried about you. Yeah. I couldn't sleep until I knew you were okay. Okay, no offense, um, I'd like you all to leave, please. [Kelly] Come on, you don't mean that. Come on. We came all the way up here to see you. I wouldn't be here if I didn't care about you. - Chris! - Shit, I'm sorry. Hey man, let me help you with that. Thank you, Brad. Stacy, are you okay? [Stacy] Yeah. Oh my God, what happened? Stacy! (door closes) (ominous music) [Kent] There you go, Detective. [Black] Thank you. That was some fire. (phone rings) Hey Sheriff, how are you? - Hey, look at this. - Oh, fine. There's a tricycle in the rubble. Yeah, I have two detectives from Beaumont. Well, they're looking at the photos from the Gillis burn site. - I don't believe it. I know. Oh? Okay. Yeah, yeah, Sheriff. Sorry, Detectives, I'm gonna have to take these photos back. - Why? - Sheriff's orders. (phone rings) (solemn music) You'd think they'd have cleaned this place up by now. Police has covered this area many times, Black. What do you expect to find now? I'm not sure. Then why are we here? Just 35 years of experience. Find anything? (Black grunts) Huh. That's odd. (foreboding music) Somewhat fresh. [Black] Oh Christ! What'd you find? We gotta get the sheriff up here. [Sheriff] Well, that's a skull, all right. [Burke] Yep, that would be a skull. I don't appreciate sarcasm. So you're a detective? Was a detective, retired now. Him too. What city? Beaumont. Why in the hell'd you come up to Mount Falls just to dig up skulls? Just following a lead. My men need to have a look at this. We need to find out who this belongs to. Well, I think it's connected to a disappearance of a mother and her twin daughters back in Beaumont in '92. The Becky Comfort Case. Never heard of it. It was all over the media. Well, I never heard of it. Now we can take it from here. And since you two are retired, why don't you have the Beaumont Police call me tomorrow morning? Just not too early, though, 'cause I got plans tonight. Me and the wife got big plans. You have plans? Needs to be tonight. Since the grave has been exposed, animals could drag away the rest of the remains. All right, I suppose you, I suppose you want credit for this skull, huh? [Black] I don't care who gets credit. It, it must be just a lost hiker. Well, nobody seems to know what happened to Mike Gillis, this could be him. Well, that's possible. Never can tell, Mike Gillis may still be alive. Look, you guys ain't even detectives no more. My men can handle this crime scene, and I know how to handle a crime scene! (foreboding music) Jim, Jim, are you there? Jim, come in! Listen, I want you to go down to San Bernardino and ask for Detective Merck. Get him up here, have him bring a couple men. Quietly. Okay. [Sheriff] Now, I said. (eerie music) (ominous music) (Stacy gasps) It's over, Brad, okay? Leave. No. I know you don't mean that. No, there's nothing you can say, nothing that you can do. Just please leave me alone. Oh, what? Just listen to me, Stacy, okay? To what, more of your bullshit lies? Your promises? Come on, don't... Don't do this to me, okay? Don't... Don't do this to us. There is no more us, okay? Just, please... Just move on, okay? Let's just talk when you've settled down, okay? You know we're meant to be. (melancholy music) [Girl] Mommy. Okay, I'll leave. You win. But before I go, just answer this question honestly, okay? Do you still love me? I do, and I can't love you anymore. Because love is not about feeling worthless. That's how you make me feel. No, no. It's not gonna work. Why do you have to be so difficult? [Stacy] It's over, Brad. After everything I've done for you? [Stacy] Please, please... You just wanted a free ride, didn't you, huh? Go... Why do you hurt me so? Leave me alone, please. (tense music) You blame it on me? You wanted the baby! It wasn't action, it wasn't my fault. I know you still love me. [Stacy] No, no, Brad! No, Brad! You're mine, you always will be mine. Please leave me alone. [Girl] I found you, Mommy. I know you still love me. - Kill him, Mommy. - My, my head... The voices... - Kill him, Mommy. What? [Girl] Kill him, Mommy. You hear that? [Brad] What's the matter with you, huh? This place is haunted. Haunted, huh? Don't be fucking stupid! [Kelly] Stacy? What is going on, Stacy? Oh my god! Stacy, wake up, wake up. Chris! Stacy, wake up, wake up, wake up. Oh my god, oh my god. (foreboding music) Why do I keep doing that? Haunted, how funny. Haunted, that's right. [Girl] Why do you hurt Mommy? What the... [Girl] You're not going to hurt Mommy anymore. (suspenseful music) You're not going to hurt Mommy anymore. Quit fucking around, guys! [Girl] Why do you hurt Mommy? You're not going to hurt Mommy anymore. You are a bad daddy. (girls giggle) (suspenseful music) Here. I'm going out of my mind. That bastard's gonna pay for what he did. The fucker's dead. I just keep hearing noises, it's like I'm going insane. Noises, what kind of noises are you hearing? I just keep hearing this, this little girl calling out to me, like, like I'm her mother. (Chris chuckles) I'm sorry, you were being serious. What's happening? It's just stress, baby, okay? With Brad and all the other crazy stuff that's going on. You know, stress can drive you crazy. You were right to come up here. You just, you need a little peace and quiet. How am I supposed to get peace and quiet when I just keep hearing this crazy kid every two seconds? [Kelly] Okay, you know what? Mama Kelly is on the job. What? Yep. You need to get some sleep. Come on, get under. (melancholy music) Now just sleep, okay? (suspenseful music) [Girl] Kill him, Mommy. He has been bad. [Stacy] Brad! Chill, it's all right! (Stacy whimpers) It's okay, calm down. Calm down, it's not your fault. You were just dreaming. You were just dreaming. Okay? Lay back down. Just dreaming. Okay? Just calm down. (solemn music) [Kent] I can't believe we didn't find this before. I want you two to be quiet about this. - But Sheriff... - We are gonna do this my way, and I don't want a panic on our hands. Now you two do your normal rounds tonight, but if you see any more of this crazy shit, you call me. All right, sure thing, Sheriff. (footsteps approach) (foreboding music) [Stacy] I saw you! Come back here! [Kelly] What's wrong? I saw, I saw the little girl. We gotta, we gotta go. [Kelly] Wait, where we going? [Chris] What are you guys, what are you doing? [Kelly] Stacy, hold on! Come on, she went over here, I think. Okay. Sure, we'll follow her this way. Stacy, I thought you told Brad to leave. [Stacy] I did. Okay, well that explains it. He was the one that knocked on the, on the window, so can we please go inside now? [Stacy] It wasn't him. It was a girl. Yeah. Come on, let's... I mean, I know she's here. Can we just look a little further, please? Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's just go deeper in the woods, Kel. Chris, come on. Really? This is a good idea, this is a really good idea. (tense music) (suspenseful music) (Judy gasps) - Boo! Ass. Where were you? [Sal] Just messing around. [Judy] It still looks fake. Really? Some people don't think so. I happen to think it looks pretty fucking good. The doll's fine, just don't mess around with it. Hey, I need a break. Can you take over? Yeah. Now you stay here while I do this, okay. (unsettling music) (Sal groans) Sal? Sal? Sal. Sal. Sal. Where are you? Where are you? Sal? (foreboding music) Sal? Is that... Is that you? (whimpers) (suspenseful music) (Judy screams) (tense music) [Kent] Why are we the only ones out here now? [Jim] You got me. What is all this stuff? Looks like some sort of campsite. [Kent] Campsite. Yeah. [Jim] Oh man, there's some weird stuff here, Kent. Jim, careful. Oh my god. [Kent] Jesus. (foreboding music) Uh, Wendy? (smooth R&B music) Well, what is it, did you see something? No. - Are you okay? - Yeah. When are you leaving? Uh, soon. I wanna go check on a girl and her boyfriend at the Dovic cabin. (phone rings) - Hold on, I got another call. Hello? - Hey girl. Hey. Whoa, what happened? [Judy] Someone killed my boyfriend! Oh my god, Wendy, Wendy, we need help up here! It's okay, okay. You know, I'm just waiting on Phil. - Phil, what's going on? - Yeah. Wendy! He's always looking for something. - Wendy! - Mm-hm, yeah. - What the hell? (yelps) - I know. (Phil screams) I know. (Phil groans) (Judy screams) Hold on a second. Hey, did you leave yet, we're not gonna wait forever. (Phil groans) Are you there? Phil! Phil! (tense music) Oh, do you, oh, what is that smell? - That's nasty. - Oh. - Oh my god. - What is this fucking... [Kelly] Chris, we don't have Stacy! [Chris] What do you want me to do? What do you mean, what do we, we're in the middle of the woods, we don't have... (shushes) Quiet down! We need to leave, okay, we need to get out of here. This is not... This is not, no, no. We need to go. - Stacy? - Shit. Now we can't fucking see, Chris. I told you to, god... - Babe? - Do you hear that? Babe, is that... Would you stop dragging me, I can't see. - Stacy? - I think I got, wait. - Babe. - There we go. - What? - Oh my god! Oh god! - Oh my god. (suspenseful music) Stacy, no, don't you look. (Stacy screams) [Dispatcher] Wendy, you left your post, what's going on? [Wendy] Something is not right, I'm checking on Phil. (Kelly gasps) Can we just, can we just stop for a second? Where the fuck are we going? I don't know, okay? I think we're lost. Great. Chris, run! No, we gotta analyze this, this is not gonna work! (tense music) [Wendy] Phil! No. [Kelly] Chris, I don't care, just go knock on the door and see if they can help us. [Stacy] Hippies, the hippies live here. The what? Oh great, this is fantastic. Bunch of stoners are gonna help us out. What're we gonna do? I don't know how to get back. - We need to get the hell out of here, okay? Your friend is just, she's losing it. (foreboding music) I found you, Mommy. Hug, you could have been my mommy. Hug. I could have been your daughter. (tense music) [Kelly] What has happened, what happened? [Chris] What did you see, is anybody in there? Babe, are you okay? Okay, Chris, she is going into shock. We gotta get out of here. [Chris] I get it, hello? Okay, take a deep breath. Deep breath, okay? Stacy, what did you see? Little girl. See who? What little girl, I didn't see a little girl, it's an empty house. Stacy, there is no little girl. [Chris] There's nobody in there, Kel. There's nobody in there, she's flipping out, look. [Kelly] Okay, stop yelling at us! I'm sorry, I'm just, you know, your friend has obviously checked out here! Look, there's a phone at the house. We're gonna call the police, all right? - Let's just get out of here. This is freaking me out. Let's go, come on, come on. [Kelly] You think this is the right way? (foreboding music) (knocking) We're closed. I'm a detective, I'd like to ask you a few questions. [Murray] How can I help you? Thanks for letting me in, I know it's after closing time, but I won't take too much of your time. I'm Detective Black from Beaumont, and I'm investigating the disappearance of a woman and her two daughters. You wouldn't happen to know a Mike Gillis, would you? Oh, Mike Gillis, that son of a bitch? Well, I've asked around about him, and nobody seems to know about him. Even the sheriff doesn't know about it. Oh, he knows. Everybody knows. They just don't want to talk about it. I knew his wife, too. His wife? Yeah, she used to come in here all the time. Make those strange purchases. I knew she wasn't pregnant. What strange purchases? Well, like two of everything. Two bottles, two sets of clothes, like for twins. I remember her distinctly. She was a kind of a homely girl, but extremely polite. And then she stopped coming in. Soon after that, he was gone. Can you tell me anything more about this Mike Gillis? Well, not too much, he was kinda closed-mouthed and kept to himself. Except when his house burnt down, then he was the talk of the town, but for all the wrong reasons. When Claudia disappeared, he went up in the mountains and never came to town again. Well, some people thought he might've murdered Claudia. If you knew all of this, why didn't you call the authorities? Well, I just didn't want to get too involved... Murray, Murray! We got a problem, I need ammo. [Officer] I can't believe Phil's dead. [Wendy] The last thing Phil said was that there were people at the Dovic cabin. [Black] But you did say the police are on their way? [Officer] Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while, they're in another county. [Black] Hurry! (tense music) (suspenseful music) [Kelly] Chris! [Chris] Told you this was a bad idea. Wait for me, Jesus. Okay, Chris, you need to lock all the doors and stuff. I'm taking Stacy into the bedroom, okay? All right, yeah, I gotta call 911. We gotta get the fuck out of here! Jeez, fuck. Okay, all right, okay. (phone beeps) You fucking piece of shit. Come on, come on. There's no dial tone. There's no dial tone! You don't understand. I didn't mean to kill her. I didn't... - Kill who? I wanted children, but I didn't... (somber music) I didn't mean to do it, he made me! She would've been five, oh, my baby. What are you talking about? Kelly, where's Brad? Okay, everything's gonna be okay, okay? We're gonna get you to the doctor, okay? Stacy, did you leave the window open? (foreboding music) [Girl] Mommy? - Who's there? - Mommy? I'm not afraid of you! Stop! Stop messing with my mind! [Girl] Mommy. (stairs creak) Show yourself. Now! [Girl] Mommy? No! I see you found your rag doll. Where are you going, Mommy? Why are you trying to take Mommy away? Where are you taking Mommy? (Judy yelps) Mommy, the bad man's gonna hurt you too? We won't let him hurt you anymore. No one will hurt you ever again. (Stacy screams) (phone rings) [Operator] 911, what is your emergency? Hello, hi, yeah. There's someone butchering people up here, okay? So you... (dial tone blares) Hello? What the fuck? Kel, I don't have any service! (foreboding music) Fucking woods. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Hello, 911, what's your emergency? - Kel? Kel? - Hello? Can you hear me? Ah, fuck! (dial tone blares) Who the fuck are you? No, no, no, no, you don't want to do that. Okay, just stay back, oh my! There's two of you, you look, what do you want? I didn't do anything, okay? I don't know what the fuck's going on here. I didn't do anything, all right? Just please, please. [Operator] Hello, ma'am, ma'am, are you all right? Hello, hello! I'm in the Dovic house, fucking Mount Falls, please! These bitches are fucking me up! Please send somebody, please! She's trying to slice me, please just stop. Stop, wait, wait, wait, wait, you don't want to, please. Don't... [Operator] What's happening? Are you there? Hello, hello? (tense music) Shit. Okay, you guys check the cabin. We'll go around back. [Kent] Sheriff's Department! Aw, Jesus! [Jim] Ah, jeez. Got another one. Ken, we got a serious problem on our hands. Oh my god. [Jim] The killer could still be here, let's go check out front. Let's go! [Brad] I'm not ready to have a child. (Stacy groans) Why would you do this to someone you love, huh? (tense music) [Stacy] No, Brad! No, Brad! (Stacy gasps) [Brad] I love you, don't you see that? You're always just thinking about you, so selfish. (Stacy yelps) Why do you hurt me, Stacy? I love you. [Stacy] No, Brad! (cries) No! No, Brad, no! It's all my fault. [Girl] Mommy? [Stacy] It's all my fault. Mommy? Mommy? (Stacy hyperventilates) (Brad grunts) (Stacy screams) (Stacy groans) No! No. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it, I'm sorry. [Girl] You killed me, why? Why, Mommy? [Stacy] She would've been five, she would've been five. Oh, my baby. (tense music) (shushes) You'll wake my dolly. Don't move, let me see your hands. Hands! Are you alone... (Cassie shouts) Ken! Hey, drop the gun! Drop the gun! (gun fires) (Cassie screams) [Cassie] Sister? Sister. Wake up. Wake up. Stacy? (foreboding music) [Cassie] Sister? Sister? [Kelly] Can you hear me? - Sister. - Stacy! Stacy, get me out of here! [Cassie] Don't leave me. Don't leave me, sister. [Kelly] Somebody get me out of here! Get me out of here! Stacy? - Sister? - Get me out of here! Sister? - Stacy! - Sister? - Can anybody hear me? - Don't leave me. - Hello? - Don't leave me. [Kelly] Stacy? Stacy! - The bad mans killed my sister. - Let me out of here! Why, Mommy? [Kelly] Stacy! Come with me. (foreboding music) Stacy! Get me out of here! Stacy? Stacy, please, get me out of here! Stacy! Get me out of here! Stacy, can you hear me? Stacy! Stacy, I'm in here! Get me out! I'm in here, get me out! (foreboding music) Stacy, I'm in here! Let me out! Please let me out! - She's still got a pulse. [Kelly] Hello? I think she's in shock though, get an ambulance over here. - Let me out of here! - Bill, we need an ambulance over at the Dovic cabin. - Let me out! [Black] I see two women running through the woods. [Kelly] Help, get me out of here! Oh, oh my god! [Wendy] It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. - What happened? - It's okay. - Oh my god. Where's Stacy, I need to find Stacy. [Wendy] She's okay, she's okay, it's all right. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right. Oh my god. You don't... (tense music) This is my town, and I want this cleared up just as much as you do. Suit yourself, just don't get in my way. Sir, the aunt and uncle of Stacy Walker are here. Press too. - Christ, so soon? Small town, doesn't take much. So, we're looking for two women? That's right, Sergeant, here they are. Let's go find them. Know they're out here somewhere. (heart monitor beeps) Hey there. (suspenseful music) (Cassie gasps) (Cassie screams) (doctors shout) Sedative! (nurse screams) All right, just calm down. She's out. (heart monitor beeps) Did you find her, anything? We have a lot of people looking for your niece, sir. Oh god. Can't believe this is happening to us. We'll find her, I promise. Detective Black, we got another body up here. (flies buzz) Now 17 years ago, Maggie's sister Becky and her sister's twin daughters were abducted. Now one of the girls has been found, but the question still looms, where is the other twin? I'll have more coming up. (reporters chatter) You have her in the jail? We had a hard time controlling her, she's wild. Well, we've got to get her to a better, more secure facility. [Sheriff] This is temporary. She's gotta see the judge tomorrow. You're talking about her like she's some sort of animal. She's a little girl, she's a victim. This girl killed four people that we know of. Probably more. She stabbed a nurse with a pen. In the eye, no less. She's, she's just frightened, that's all, that's all it is. Let me take her home, I can help her. I can get her treatment. She is not an innocent little girl anymore. I believe the twins have been living in the woods all this time like wild animals. They've become predators, killing out of necessity. Now granted, she is the victim of abuse, but she's also a cold-hearted killer! She's gonna be okay, because she has family now. Please. She's all I got left of my sister. Could somebody get these cameras out of here! At least let me see her, Sheriff, please. I haven't seen my niece in 17 years. She didn't ask for this, this isn't her fault. Please. (Cassie screams) (foreboding music) Sister! Sister! (Cassie screams incoherently) (Cassie sings softly) (officers chat) (ominous music) Cassie. Your name is Cassie. Mommy? No. Maggie. - Maggie. - Aunt Maggie. I'm your mommy's sister. Everything's gonna be just fine. Huh? No one's gonna hurt you. No, it's okay. It's okay. Do you like that? That's a perfume by a beautiful movie star. Oh, she was gorgeous. Just like you. (camera shutter clicks) It's okay, it's okay. (Maggie screams) (melancholy music) [Black] You know, it's tough being a detective, especially when you have to give it up. Guys like Burke can let go. He went back to sipping cognac and watching the Dodgers. God, I envy that. For me, the evidence is stacked. One savage twin is locked up in a mental institution, but where is the other one? Where is this Stacy Walker? These questions will stay with me until I find the answers, and I will continue searching, 'cause that's what I do. My wife used to kid me all the time. She called me a dog with a bone. She was right. Rest, Mommy, rest here. What's your name? What's your, what's your sister's name? I love my sister always. I know. So you live here? This is my home. You live in the woods, why? [Sister] Safe. Safe from who? Mans. You mean men. What men? Bad mans. They beat girls like me. Who beat you? Daddy. (gentle music) Your father abused you? My daddy did too. And my boyfriend, he beats me. Me kill boyfriend. Kill who? The bad man that was mean to you. You killed Brad? No! No, no, no, no, no. I killed Brad. Do you hear me? (sister giggles) Don't blame yourself for that, okay? Brad. (giggles) It's funny. You know, not all men are bad. Just the ones you love. [Sister] Love. Mm-hm, yeah, love. Mommy loved me. Sister loved me. There's no one left to love me. I love you. [Sister] Mommy. I like it when you call me mommy. Come on. (foreboding music) (eerie music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
