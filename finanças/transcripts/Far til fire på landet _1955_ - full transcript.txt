- Whoa, where did Uncle Anders go? - What, he's not there? He said he would come right away. There he is. - Nah! Balloons! - Here you go. Hold on. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Here you go, Sis. - Nah, Uncle Anders. I probably thought you were too big. Then we give it to Father. - It is gone. - Our Lord grabbed it there. What should we see first? The first thing I want to see is an ice-cold glass of beer. Yes that sounds good. Then the children can look at the animals in the meantime. - Shouldn't we get money for animal feed? - Yes. Yes. Let me. Now I'll see, children. Come over here. Today I am the one who gives. Here you go. Nah, I rather think Sis must be cashier. - A ten? It is way too much. - Then there's some popsicles and other nonsense. I want to ride the little horses. - You will. - How handsome you are, Uncle Anders. - He also often eats at our house. Shame on you, Per. He ate four ground beef the day before yesterday! Well, do you count the food? Yes, Sis does too. There were only three to each. So, Per. Now it's probably best we go. Children, you know. Bye for now. (laughing) Ouch. Some long necks. Yes, and some big freckles. Where are you in a bad mood? Can't you smile a little? (growls) - Per, they look like your elephant. - You should have taken it out here. - What are you eating, baby? - It was just that bun. It was for the animals. Now do you want to give the elephant the last bite? Yes, if I can hit. I cannot. Sis! Nah, is that you, Tove? Hi, Tove. No, it was fun. And you're driving with a pram. Yes, I was the first in our class to get married. - How adorable she is. - Yeah right? Dik, dik, dik. What about you? Aren't you married or engaged or something like that? Nah, not even 'or anything like that.' I have plenty of time, no rush. - Dad, can I park the balloons here? - Yes, let me have them. Uha, now watch out, they don't go into the air. (squaks) - It's darn fun. - Yes, it looks like Uncle Anders. - How ashamed you must be. - Can the monkey understand what we say? (laughing) - Where did Sis go? - She stands over there and looks at a child. Phew, we're already plenty. - Well, now we don't have any more nuts. - It could be that he gives them someone. - What is it? - Pepper. Now you're going to watch something funny. - In a little while, he'll sneeze like hell. - It is a shame. - Do not do that. - You have to be kind to the animals. Nonsense. I'm dying of laughter. Now look here. - Mind your own business! - Ouch! Hold it. Are you going to kick my sister? - I'll give you. - Ole, watch out! Sis! Help! Sis! Come on! You big world! It's Ole. Ole! - Ouch! Do you bite? - Ouch! Will you instantly quit! What should we do, though? Take it easy, little Sis. I'll fix it. (Sneezes) Serves him right. I have to report you... to supervision. - You don't dare to do that. - Well then... to the police. I say it! You can only wait for it... if we meet again, brats. (laughing) That boy had quite a cold. Cheers. It was a good idea to go in here. It's nice and peaceful here for the children. How is your summer vacation? Now we were in Norway last winter, so we are not traveling anywhere. - What do the children say about that? - no trace. We live freely and beautifully, and the children have the garden. - They take it in good spirits. - Well, well. - Shouldn't we play something or other? - Father can be here immediately. - Do we have a war of nerves or not? - It is a shame. He is so old. Well, he is not, and it is strategically correct to continue the Cold War. Mellow the enenmy! - He has the money to go to the countryside. - Shhh, it's dad. - Good day, children. - Good day, dad. Well, listen, why are you sitting here? Go out and play. - With whom? - Our playmates are in the country. - Yes, there is someone who can. - Then you have to play with each other. Well, maybe one would be allowed to enter his own house? Thank you. It was friendly. Thanks. What did I say? He's just about to capitulate. - I think so as well. - One more tooth and we have him. - You can believe I'm hungry today. - That's good, Uncle Anders. - Good day, Anders. - Hello my friend. Now I can't do it anymore. Ever since we inherited the 925 crowns, I have had no peace for the children. - You shouldn't have said that. - It is easy to be wise afterwards. We can usually talk freely. - Have they been naughty? - On the contrary. They are so polite that it is unbearable. - They want to go to the country. - But honestly, little father. Are you starting now too? No, but the children would never bother if they knew we couldn't afford it. But you came yourself and waved that money in their noses. They must not be sold up for any land stay. The children grow out of their clothes, the taxes rises, the prices... - Yes, little father, we know all about that. - Then maybe we can get some dinner? - Yes, now I have to call for the children. - Thanks. There is no need, Sis. We are here. - And we have washed our hands. - All by ourselves. Well, well, it's excellent. Then I put the food on the table. What did I say? - So what should we have to eat today? - Fish patties. Darnit. First of all, there is no point in criticizing the food, - - and secondly, I don't want to hear the term 'darnit' in my house. It is the most horrible sound in the Danish language. Here you go. - How many must you take, Little Per? - Three. We must have apple cake on top. I got a card from Birthe yesterday. She is on Skagen with her parents. Well, then she'll probably meet Henrik. - Is it pretty on Skagen, father? - Lovely. And Lis is on Bornholm. Is it expensive over there? It is expensive everywhere. And now I don't want to hear another word. - Well, we want to go to the countryside. - You will keep your your mouth shut, you will. You can bathe at Bellevue, and you have the garden to play in. It's really too wrong. You should start making something. After all, that is also what we sit and do. (the giggle) That's enough. Do you want to leave the table immediately? Dad is angry. - Well, we're going to have apple cake. - Yes, we, but not you, my lord. Get lost! - Darnit! - Nah, what was that? (Anders laughs) I can't get one more bite into this atmosphere. Sorry. 'Disappear,' he said. But you know what I do? I don't care about him at all. - Who are you talking to? - Bodil Kjer, and she sticks with me. - Here you go, little darling. Your apple cake. - Thanks. But you must not say anything to the others. Just put the plate under the bed when you're done. Goodnight, Little Peter. Goodnight, little Sis. You can see there. There are still nice people. (push, push) Hey, Sis. Then I got to say goodbye to you anyway. - Do you also neeed to travel? - Yes. Are you upset? No, but all people travel. We're the only ones who don't have to. - Why not? - It is too expensive to stay in a hotel. Who says you have to stay in a hotel? You can then rent in somewhere. I know a Mrs. Mikkelsen in Jutland. She has a nice little house. - Do you think she can have us? - Write and ask. - Sis! Hey, Peter. - Good day, Mie. - Won't you come in now, Sis? - No, you can just leave the table. - I'll do that. - Now you have to get the address. Anyone need more apple cake? You have hardly eaten anything. - Yes, Uncle Anders has. - So, Ole. - Per? - Yes. Here you go, but you mustn't say anything to the others. I just put the plate under the bed. - Yes that is a good idea. Good night, Per. - Good night, little Mie. It must be such a lovely place. And she only takes 65 crowns a week in rent. - Well, does he say that? - Yes. - Well, now I have to make some coffee. - Thanks. You should think a little about Sis. She goes here all year round and cooks and cleans. Take care of you all. She could use a little vacation. You are absolutely right. I haven't thought about that at all. Listen, children? - Can you do dad a favor? - Yes, father. Go out and tell your sister, we're going to the country anyway. Yes, father. What did you say? Is that right? - Hooray! - So, so, so, you crazy children. - What happened? - We are going to the country! - Is it true, father? - If there is room at the fisher widow. - What was her name? - Mrs. Mikkelsen. I have the address here. Then I will write immediately if there are any rooms available. - Three rooms. - No, don't talk about. Two is enough. One for Sis, Mie and Little Per, and Ole and I are sleeping together. Now, fortunately, I'm on the mend. You don't ask if I want to come along. - Could you do that? - Nah. Ahh, why not? You can afford it. And you also have time. - Maybe you don't feel like it? - Then why shouldn't you come along? If I wasn't able to, who would? - It was funny. - Do you want to come? - Per? Are you sleeping? - Yes. - Here is a bucket of apple cake. - I'm not hungry. Nonsense with you. Get up. The Cold War is won. - Has the enemy surrendered? - Yes, we are going to the country. Father is writing to ask when we must come. It is powerful. Wouldn't you like to have some of that apple pie yourself? No, you must have it all, but not a word to Sis. I put the plate under the bed. - It's fine. Good night, you. - Good night. It's probably a shame, Bodil Kjer, that you don't like apple cake. - Is the letter ready soon? I'll mail it. - Just a moment. Then we will have to see what Mrs Mikkelsen answers. - May I come with? - Yes, you can run with it both of you. Listen, Anders. Can you sit alone for a moment? I have something important to attend to. Yes, don't think about me. I sit quietly here. - Nah, what is it? Are you standing here? - Yes. What will you? Yes... - That bowl is empty. - Indeed, it is too. - I was thinking of Little Per. - Well? I did too. - Can't I give it to him? - Yes, you still have to see. I think it's a shame he won't have any apple cake at all. Now you have to see what Uncle Anders has. Well, you got it? Otherwise, I brought a portion. Don't you think you can eat it yourself? Yes, I can do that well anyway. Are you looking forward to going to the country? - Yes, really. - I certainly do too. Sorry, miss. You don't know where a Mrs Mikkelsen lives, do you? Yes, I know that. - Can you see the little house over there? - Yes. - Shame, is it there? - No. But you have to turn down to the beach, and then it's the first road on the right. And by the way, I don't want to hear that 'shame' a second time. Remember it. Yes, father. - Hope Uncle Anders can find it. - It will probably work out. Hello Hello. I had to have a bike and a suitcase. - And an elephant. - Yeah. - An elephant? - Yes, I can have it on the back of the bike. Oh? Aah, yes, yes, yes. - There! - How adorable it is. Yes, then I say welcome. Go ahead and go inside. - What is your name, dear friend? - My name is Per. Go ahead and come inside, little Per. - It was great that you could have us. - It fit so well. The family that usually lives here will not arrive for another 14 days. Yes, that is the dining room. I wanted to make up on the diva for the other gentleman, who is coming too, right? He is here, he's lying out in the rhubarb. - Ih, you merciful one! - Hurry up and help Uncle Anders. Welcome. A very warm welcome. Thank you so much, that's too much. - Has something happened to the bike? - Has the suitcase been scratched? Well, little elephant, you haven't broken your trout, have you? No one asks if I've hit myself. - Do you have it? - No. (laughing) - Now I have to follow you up to the house. - I can go myself. - Is it far to the port? - No, it's five minutes from here. - Shouldn't we go down there? - I want to go! Look, a boat is coming in. - We will go and look at it. - Yes. See how he looks like Peter at home from our road. - I'll go and look. - Take me with you! Sorry, but isn't that Peter? No, my dear friend. You have indeed gone wrong in the city. - My name is Ole. - Oh, leave it alone! - It is clear enough. - It's you, Peter. Howdy, kids. Well, you could find yourself over here. - We didn't know you were here. I would have looked more forward to then. - What are you doing? I am fishing. It's my uncle's bath. I took a job for the summer. I earn for my studies. This is what is called seasonal work. - Something like selling Christmas trees? - Yes, exactly. Where is Sis? She unpacks. Would you like some fried cod to take home? - Yes, thank you very much, Peter. - Then wait a moment. - I guess that's pretty cool of him. - I don't care much about cod. Yes, when they are fried and you get cucumber salad and new potatoes. Yes, and rheum on top. (laughing) Yes, I am particularly interested in the kitchen. It was also supposed to be a holiday for my big girl, - - so I have decided to cook the food myself. - Shouldn't I take care of the cod? - Why? They look very nice. - They don't want to eat the roe, do they? - Yes, absolutely. I love roe. Yes, but there is now no roe in fried cod. There are so many other things that need to go out, and so I take care of them. Then I peel potatoes in the meantime. Do you have a big knife? Don't you want the potato peeler? - I scrape best with a knife. - Well, then you get it. - Yes, it's good. - Here you go. - But be careful now. - They can be quite calm. (humming) Whoa, little lady. Can I park my bike in the shed? Yes, please. But there is such a mess. Well, that's enough anyway. Uh, it's a whole salon. - lh, there is an easel. - And a paint box. A painter lived here, but he left without taking his things with him. Then maybe I could borrow his remains? - Yes, I would really like to. Can you paint? - I do not know. I've never tried it, and then you can't know if you can until you tried. Have you ever seen a cow climb up a flagpole? - No? - You can see. Hole in the head, right? Thank you very much. Goodbye. (trolley) - Sis! You don't have any gauze, do you? - Yes, little father. But what has happened? Nothing special. But they have some strange potatoes. - They slip through one's fingers. - Now I have to give you some iodine. - Not that. It stings. - Yes, but it cleans. It is not necessary, Sis. I've had it under the tap. Just give me a big bandage around. I think I'll take over the cooking. - Don't talk about. Where are the Boers? - They are out to find playmates. So, so... Wait for me! - You don't slouch, do you, Per? - No, not yet. - You can't see my pants, can you? - Yes, they are light blue. - Come on, here's something to look at. - What a nice house. Forget about the house, but there are two Indian tents, there. - Then here is children. - It's a sure bet. - No, a real Indian probably lives here. - Are you really smart, man? Here? Yes, you don't know what they have here in Jutland. - Whoa! - Beware! Per! Per, stop! Hello, I just tumbled. Good day. - Did you hurt yourself? - No. - Hello. Hello. - They haven't learned to speak yet. - Yes, we can probably talk. - What a luck. My name is Per. (Mie shouts) Hello, down there. Where did you end up? We are coming now. Have you seen the two tents up there? - Yeah. - Whose is that? - They are those from Copenhagen. - Do you want to go up there? - No. - Well, come Per. Give me your hand and I'll help you up. - Shall we go up there? - We sneak up and scout. Then l must go down on the stomach, otherwise we can't sneak. Come. (Indian howl) I want to go home. - What a coward you are, man. - Come on. Hurry up now. Don't make a sound or I'll kill you. - Now we'll be there soon. Wait here. - Per, wait here... Where is Per? - Look there. - He has captured Per. - I think I know him. - Yes, it's him from the Zoo. - That bully. We have to go and free Per. - Let me. Stop! What are you doing here, wretched pale faces? Oh, hold on. Can you release my brother, and that at once. Take him if you dare. Black Eagle has spoken. (Indian howl) (laughing) I'll take your dagger and free Per while you beat him up. - Are you afraid, white man? - Put that tomahawk and get some smacking. You little fool. Why didn't you call for help? Because he said he was going to kill me, and I don't care about that. Ugh, ugh, ugh, stop! Welcome to our wigwam, stranger. You must not come and spoil a good fight. We Indians must not violate hospitality. I haven't invited anyone. - Come on Ole, we're going. - No, now we had it so fun. - What is your name, white man? - My name is Ole. My name is Hanne. Do you live near here? Yes, down by the harbor. This is my sister and little brother. Will you be my son, Yellow Wolf? No, I will not. I want to be King of the mounted police. - You, ha! - Well, don't laugh at Little Per. No, then you can get a pair on your forehead. Come on, Hanne, we don't want to play with the stupid kids. (mouth fart) (gong-gong) Come on, Hanne, we're going home to eat. Our cook girl gets so mad if we don't come on time. - Ih, do you have a cook? - Yes, how else would we get food? - Will you come up here tomorrow? - Yes, please. - Look, I'll come first. - No, I will. - Ih, they're probably rich. - Yes, we are not poor either. Nah, we just don't have any money. (laughs) You have ink on your finger, Uncle Anders. Ink? Nah, it's paint. I have started to paint the sea in riots. Shouldn't you wait a bit with that? It's eerily quiet at the moment. Ink-quiet... Oh, but that doesn't matter. - An artist uses his imagination. - I didn't know you could paint. I didn't know that either, but I will be surprised. (laughs) - What are you sitting and sucking on? - It's a piece of vanilla. Well, I haven't put vanilla in the porridge. Well, no. It is an ocean dispute. See. (uhhh - addr) Would you please put it on the plate. Oh yeah. It doesn't taste very good either. - Whoa, where are you going? - I can not eat anymore. You don't get up from the table until we're all done. - Well, I'd rather go out to play. - Will you then ask him to observe table manners? Yes. You see, Per. Either you remain seated at the table, - - or you disappear outside immediately. Yes, please. Look, that's how it should be arranged. (engine thumps) - It's fine, uncle. - Well. Then you just stop the engine. - Rigmor? - Yes, what's up dad? Are you going home now? - Yes, are you coming? - No, I'll stay here for a while. I'm thinking of asking Peter if he doesn't want to go to the cinema. You, Peter,there are going a very good film at the cinema. Yes, I have seen it over in Copenhagen. You should go over. Yes, it is absolutely right. And then maybe you should sit here - - and wait to see if your adored Sis should settle down here. - Aahr, screw you. - I've seen her. - She looks like a movie star. - Yeah, right? Now I think you need to hurry a little or you won't get a ticket. Oh, well, I'm not going to disturb the idyllic anyway. - Hey, Sis. - Hey, Peter. - Welcome over here. - Thank you. - Don't you want to come down here? - Yeah. - Ih, how nice it is here. - Yes, just look around. - I like the smell of tar. - I can also. - It was a good idea that we came over here. - Yes, brand good, if I must say so. - Aren't you going out on the pier? - No, I have to put the kids to bed. Now if I can just find them. - Yes, but maybe tomorrow? - Yes, now we have to see. There they are. Hi! Goodbye, Peter. Oh, shouldn't we be up a bit yet? What, little Sis? Nah, you're tired now. Now you're going home to bed. - Whoa! - And there is also another day tomorrow. Off! (hens that cackle) Well, do you have chickens too, Mrs. Mikkelsen? Yes, but you were in such a hurry to come out to play, - - so you didn't see anything at all. Put, put, put, put... Well, look at the geese. (the howl) (the cackle) You must not go too far. They can get angry and snap at you. - Are they to be slaughtered on Christmas Eve? - Yes, and some for Morten's Eve. - Then I can understand, they are mad. - Oh, it's a long time to go. - Look, there's Mad's goat. - Orv, yes. Beware! It gets angry and stings you. Why do you have such hot-tempered animals, Mrs. Mikkelsen? They don't bother me either, but there are so many strangers coming. Once upon a time there was a painter, and he was always looking for it and wanted to stick, - - so he had to call for help. - It must have looked fun. (laughing) - Uhu, do you want to go in the water? - Yes... - That sounds great. - I'll get my bathing suit. - Wait for me! - Hurry up. - Do you want an old sea man with you? - Of course, Uncle Anders. - Then I'll come right away. - It is well. Sis, I don't think I'm coming. My finger probably doesn't benefit from it. Well, salt water cleans. Then there is also the fact that I have an interesting crime book. - You better stay home, little father. - Then we are here. Yes, here we are... Farewell, you old man. It's a shame you're not coming. Enjoy. (the howl and the scream) Hurry up to come. The water is nice and cold. No, no. He shouldn't have done that. - Are you sitting there enjoying yourself? - Yes, that's how I prefer to spend my holidays. Oh, that you like to read such creepy books. Dear Mrs Mikkelsen, many gifted men relax in this way. - Don't you want some peas? - Well thank you. I would like to. Now don't tell the children where they stand. Then nature will perhaps overcome the chastisement. Oh, and so what? They are such sweet children. - Yes, at the same time, they could be worse. - Hello! - Are you already there? - You can believe it was lovely. You feel like a new and better person. Now I want to go paint. I am charged with energy. With energy... - Where are the children? - They are playing down by the beach. hum hum hum hum here comes the biggest man in the garden bumpumlumumumumumumum I'm going on duty for the country of Denmark and water bumpumlumumumumumumum it's an important thing to be on guard bumpumlumumumumumumum then you have to walk with your foot outstretched in beat tratratratratratra if I ever live to be a hundred years old tratratratratra then I go here and go bumpumlumumumumumumum I'm alone in my company bumpumlumumumumumumum I always let the others free at war my uniform can withstand all bullets I'm going to storm and we'll see what happens bumpumlumumumumumumum it's a mighty blow we have to strike now bumlumumlumumumumumum on the hat, I'm seen standing there go on bumpumlumlumlumlumlumum yes I run just in case you regretted it boomumlumlumlumlumlumlum now there will be shooting with gunpowder tratratratratratra it must have been the enemy's army I saw tratratratratratra I blow on it hum hum hum hum hum now we let the big drum rumble bumlumumlumumumumlumum then no one will fight with us What do you play? - I don't play. I am a soldier. - You? Soldier? Ha! So, now don't tease Little Per, or I'll be mad at you again. Well, then help me turn that boat around. - Are you going sailing? - Yes, but you don't have to come. - Why not, if he now wants to? - Yes, but I want to be captain. - I want that too. - There cannot be two captains. - You can become a sailor. - Nix. Listen to this. Keld is captain, I'm mate, and you're admiral. - Is there anything to it? - Yes, it is the very best. Well, up with you. Then we shoot off. Ding-ding, then the ship's bell rings. See, they're not very smart. As long as they don't capside. Nothing can happen, because they cannot get beyond the first ridge. Well, no. We can also keep an eye on them. - Ouch! - What is it? I have something in my pocket. Isn't this amber? - No, it's just a plain brown stone. - Bugger! You can always tell that it's so easy. It weighs nothing. - Well, but what about this? - It's amber. What a big piece. You can both get a cigar stub for your dad and a heart for yourself. - Do you think? - There is someone who does such a thing. - Look how far they are now. - Ouchy! (hums) - Sis. - Yes. Ole and Per have sailed out in a boat, and we can't see them at all anymore. - Are they alone? - No, my brother is with me. - And he is no bigger than Ole. - But they can paddle in. - No, because they have no veins. - And the current carries them further out. - Where are you going, Sis? - Down to the harbor. Come. - Can you see anything? - Nah. Couldn't they have drifted down the coast? The last time we saw them was in that direction. And all the boats are out at sea. What should we do? - But there is one there. - Yes, come. - Have you seen three boys in a boat? - No I have not. There are three boys who have sailed out in an old boat, and they are nowhere to be seen. It is fine weather, if they are used to sailing. Well, they're not at all, and Little Per can't swim. Can't you help us? What do you do in such a case? I can give the cutters a note over the radio. Then they can keep an eye out. Yes please. If you want it? (crying) - If we never see them again. - So, so, little Mie. Who could even know that the boat was leaking? - You don't have to be afraid, Per. - Yes, I am. And I'm freezing. - You are a big boy, Per. - No, I am not. I'm not very big. If only it could stay afloat until someone sees us. Ole, we hang out outside. Then we don't weigh so much. - Walk in the water. Otherwise you'll get a cramp. - Yes. There is not a boat to be seen. I think I can hear an engine, but I can't see anyone. Hello, cutter Siam, cutter Bear, cutter Bodil. Neptune is calling. If you hear me, then answer. Hello, hello. Here is Siam. There are three boys out in an open dinghy here from Strandkoebing. If you see anything about them, let me know. Have understood. We are on our way in, so they must be in the vicinity. Straight up and warn Peter. Keep your eyes open both of you. - Sit down, Per. - Yes. Keld, I'm freezing. It spins so strangely in my legs. You just have to kick your legs. You must not lie still. I'm afraid. - Look, there they are! - They have seen us and are turning this way. Hooray! - Keld, I've had a cramp. - Hang on. Sit here, Per. I can no more. I've got a cramp in my legs. - Oh, I can't do it anymore. - They are on their way here. - Oh, I can't do it anymore. - Yes, you can. They will be here soon. Hurry up. I can't hold him anymore. A line! Hurry up! Hurry up! Just look to come up with you. I've got hold of him. Take me! Take me! - I've got hold of him. - Ouch, my leg hurts. Now I have to take him. Take a blanket around you, like that. Throw away the wet clothes. Hello, hello. It is Siam that calls Neptune. Hello Siam. It's Neptune. Then we found them. You can tell the family they're having a good time. We are on our way in full force. - Where is Ole? - He's downstairs. He's cold. He is well. - Aah, Keld. I was so scared. - I was too. Can you take care another time? - You haven't said anything at home, have you? - No, I haven't said anything. It was good. We run home, then I get warm. - Look after him, then I'll fetch Ole. - Yes, do you freeze your paws? Yes, and you can believe, little Mie, I'm not going out sailing anymore. Ole! I think she forgot to thank you? She must have been in a hurry to get home with the children. You take that girl in a completely crazy way. - Try to show interest in someone else. - Oh, nonsense. You can then pretend you do. Do you think I had got Lars Peter, - - if I hadn't pretended that I had a good eye for Ole Knudsen? - I would like to help you. - What does your boyfriend say about that? Lars Peter? He doesn't get to know anything about that. He is fishing on Thyboroen and is not coming home for the time being. - I don't think Sis will be jealous. - Well, right? Then she would be the first one it hasn't worked on. Just come. I think dad is in the kitchen, because it's steaming out the window like that. Then hurry up and hold him with conversation while I get the boys inside. (pan beaming) - Where they booze, those medisters. - You are also right in the firing line. I have to. They must be turned. Ahh, now look there. - Do you dare? - Yes. Yes. - So, so, so. - They should not be clapped, but turned. - What are you doing? - Dinner, of course. You can set the table, we just need to turn this one over. I have boiled the potatoes. That was nice. Do you think they've had enough? Yes. Yes. It's been almost two hours since I put them over. I guess that's what you call mashed potatoes. I do not understand it. They were whole when I put them in. What kind of red spot is that on your leg? It's a little bee that stung me. - It's called 'struck.' - Are you sure? - Yes. - Well. Sis, what am I going to do with those carpets? You can just go down to the boat with them. Now it's called 'stick.' I don't think you're very clever, little Ole. (laughs) So, Per. I'll probably go downstairs with those carpets for Peter. I also have to thank him because he fished you out. The food is on the table! The food is on the table! And remember: not a word to father. He must not be startled. No, that would be a shame. (knocking on the door) Peter! - Peter? - Yes. - Peter, hurry up and give me a kiss. - What? Hurry up and give me a kiss. She's out there. - Who? - Sis, you fool. (there's a knock on the door) You can hear it yourself. Now we light the lamp, then you kiss me. She's probably looking in the window. (laughs goofily) Peter! No, will you stop it. Someone is standing and watching us. Sis! - Nah, is it you, Sis? Good evening. - Good evening. - I came to deliver the carpets. - That was nice of you. - Do you know my cousin? - Nah. - We just saw each other on the street. - Yes. Then I would like to say thank you for helping Ole and Little Per. - I was beside myself in... - That's perfectly fine, Sis. Peter would have done that for anyone. - Surely. - Don't you want to come inside? Nah, thanks. I have to go home. Good night, Peter. Good night. - Hope she didn't get mad. - Uh, she went crazy. You can believe it worked. And she's going to get a lot madder yet. Well, what pleases? Yes, you are paralyzed. You can't find words. Nah, it hurts. You're not saying you're not excited? I'm a bit old-fashioned, you know. Don't you think those housings look weird? Weird? No, they don't. Go away. You have no concept of art. - Well, Anders, I think... - No, you haven't. Disappear though. (humming) - Hello, Uncle Anders. - Hello, hello. Here I come up with something you can strengthen yourself on. - Shall I pull it up? - Thanks. And put it there. - May I see your painting? - Yes, you really should. - What a sea, huh? - Yes, that is something in itself. - Yes, right? - It's very red, isn't it? Red? Yes, it must be red. I had most of the red color and then I used my imagination. The sun is setting, the sea is fiery red. Isn't it gorgeous? - I think I'll gift you that. - You mustn't do that. Oh, little Sis, you're the closest to that, aren't you? I have no evidence of that, Uncle Anders. - Nah, like that. - I think it's fine, Uncle Anders. God you don't. Disappear with you. Well, that's well done. Not a trace of artistic sense. Not even with his closest ones. (spouts and coughs) Hello, little miss, You haven't seen Mads goat, have you? - No, has it run away? - Yes, it has torn loose. And you probably know that it is dangerous to its surroundings. - As long as the children don't meet it. - No, they've gone down to the beach. I'm running because I have to find it before something happens. (Uncle Anders sings) Hm... Good day... Hm. (laughs nervously) Yes, we take it quite easy. Nice little goat. Yes, I thought so. Help, help... Go home with you. Go home with you. You didn't expect that, did you? Nice little goat. - No, how sweet it is. - Yeah, right? - May I put on my new dress? - Yes, you can believe that. Have you seen my amber heart? Yes, it's sweet. But where is the cigar pipe for dad? - I'm saving that for him for Christmas. - That's reasonable. Sis? Why can't I come to the dance? Because a little boy can't go to a bar. This morning, when I had to pick up rye bread, I was a big boy. - It is also something else. - Well? So I'm a big boy in the morning and a little boy in the evening. Now eat that piece of chocolate and stop being moldy. Ih, only Peter also wants to dance a dance with me. - It is not certain that he will come. - Yes, he said so himself. - Sis? - Yes, Little Per. Now I've eaten that chocolate and I'm still moldy. Shouldn't we try another piece? No, we won't. - Mie, you snatched my nail polish remover. - No, I have not. - I can't walk with those hands? - Now I have to give you one. - Here you go, Ole. - Thank you Sis, it was nice of you. - Is my hair roughly correct? - Completely. - You're not sick, are you? - No, I'm not. (Mie laughs) What are you laughing at? nothing... I wouldn't advise you to either. May I borrow a clean handkerchief? - You can believe that. Here you go. - Thanks. - Then I'm fine, right? - Alright. - Wonderfully charming. - Bah. - What happened to him? - He is in love. In love. Yes, that skin. - Is it in Hanne? - Yes, and it's not that crazy. - She is a good party. - I think so as well. - Dad? - Arh... Ole, how you scared me. - Come on, the rest of us are done. - I only need five pages. You cannot be familiar with that. You can finish reading when we get home. - Are you ready? - Yes. - Shouldn't anyone be staying with Per? - Mrs. Mikkelsen will. - Well, little Per. Then it's the two of us. - Yes. - Shall I tell you a story? - Yes, that would be nice. Which one would you rather have, the one with Donald Duck or 'Three Little Misses?' Then I'd rather have the one with the little miss cats. Once upon a time there were three little miss cats, and they had no father and mother. Aah, oh my god. (dance music) - There they are. - Where? - Over at the door. They just arrived. - Oh, yes. Well, what shall we have then? - Sis? Can I go out dancing? - Yes, you must. - Can I dance with Hanne? - Yes, go ahead. (claps) She has seen us. Now it applies. (dance music) - Have you seen her Peter dances with? - Yes, it's just his cousin. Just? I would certainly say that. Then one little miss cat said to the other little miss cat: Where do you think the third little miss cat is? Then the other little miss cat said: I don't know.' (door closes) Per? Per! - Well, what is it? - It's just me, little daddy. - I longed for you so much. - Well, my God, though. If you were my little boy, I wouldn't leave you, I'd take you with - - and say: What kind of cake do you want, Little Per? - Hear the foxy cunning youth. - Give me that plate. - Dad, though. - I know that, but now he is here. - What do you think Mrs. Mikkelsen will say? - nothing, because she is sitting and sleeping. I don't think so, because she's standing over there. Aah, that's terrible. Per is away. I dozed off for a moment. Take it easy, Mrs Mikkelsen. Per is here. Sit down and have a cup of coffee. It soothes. - Where did the boy go? - He must have been running. You can think I pushed them. I tried to step on her toes. - Mie, you can't do that. - Yes, she is making a pass on Peter. He has not danced a dance with you. He can't be familiar with it. Stop looking at them. Peter can dance with whoever he wants. I don't care. - She doesn't even want to look here. - Oh, just wait. - Lars Peter? Is it you? - Yeah. - Have you been here long? - Long enough. Get up and get your beating. Can you hear what I'm saying? - Don't I have to explain? - There is nothing to explain. You have to stay away from my girl. (noise and screams) - You must hear what I have to say? - Just keep your mouth shut... Oh, no! - It's just a matter of getting out... - Then hear what I have to say. Go home to Copenhagen, where you belong. No, Lars Peter! Then hear what I say. (noise and commotion) - Stop it, you fool. - Peter! Peter! Can't you do something to stop them? It is your fault then. - Mine? No, hear now. - It was your friend who started. He couldn't know, it was a trick to make your skin crawl. - To make me? - Yes. Because you are so blind and can't see how in love Peter is with you. It's terrible. Well, then do something. Someone, stop that brawl. - Have you had enough teasing yet? - No, we have only just begun. Is it you? (laughter) Per though! Put it there. You may think I am angry with you. You said yourself that we should stop them. - I didn't mean you. Now we're going home. - Darn. Lars Peter, you big fool. Get up and give him an apology. An excuse for what? It's not me he's in love with at all. It's her. - What? - Yes. Well... Then I'm sorry, I gave you such a bad spanking. Oh, it was so little. - They have stopped. - Yes, they became good friends again. - They shook hands. - Yes, they hit each other on the shoulder. - Who won? - That's what Per did. - Well, I have to say that. - I don't like fights. If I had it, gunpowder had never been invented. I believe you so much, Anders. (cock howl) Shh! Mie. Shh! You're probably up early today, Mrs Mikkelsen? Yes, but so are you, Little Per. Would you like a glass of milk? Yes, please. Uhm, it smells baked in here. Yes, we also need buns for the morning coffee. It's Sunday after all. May I be so kind as to ask for a bun? Yes, you can believe that. Now I'm going to make one for you. - I like you, Mrs. Mikkelsen. - It was a stroke of luck, little Per. I'm sorry, we have to leave soon. Can't you visit us in Copenhagen? - Well thank you. It could well be. - Then you could bake buns every morning. Well, that got out, huh? - Well, here you are. Good morning. - Good morning, little Mie. - Here are buns. - Yes, just eat. - There is another whole plate in the oven. - Thank you. Well, this is where you are. Good morning, Mrs. Mikkelsen. - Good morning. - Here are buns! That was nice. May I have a glass of milk? - Yes, go ahead. - Thanks. - Did you sleep well? - Unfortunately no. When the heart is full of unrest, the ability to sleep fails in the quiet hours of the night. I see. It's hard to be young, Mrs Mikkelsen. Well, I understand that very well. - Good morning. - Good morning, little Ole. - Good morning. - Goodmorning everybody. Here are hot buns! Here are hot buns! (they laugh) - What are you laughing at? - Because the weather is so nice today. - And because we feel so good. - Yes. - So. Shall I make you a bun? - Yes, please. - Think, it was the attorney. - Who? Him, the killer in my book. And do you know how he behaved? I don't want to hear about murderers here in my little kitchen on a Sunday morning. - Now drink your coffee. - They are absolutely right. Thank you, Mrs. Mikkelsen. - Well, now I can't eat anymore. - That was sad, wasn't it? - I'll probably save a couple for you. - Then I can take them to my cave. - What am I hearing? Do you have a cave? - Yes, down by the big hill. - It's not the gravel pit, is it? - You must not play there. Aahr, it's just chatter with him. It's not a real cave. One day he will be an admiral and the next day commander-in-chief. - What do you want, for example to be today? - not freckled, like you. Nah, damn it. Will you sit nice, you two. (melody played out on the road) It's Peter. - Open. - So... - Howdy, Peter. - Hey, Mie. - Nice weather today, huh? - Yes, wait a minute. So, so, so... Look, now they run out in night clothes. Oh yeah. We are in the country. "Far out" in the countryside lay a small house. I've never seen such a nice house." - Are you going fishing? - Not today. I'm going down to the port. - Can't we come along? - In that clothes? - I had completely forgotten that. - We can get clothes on in no time. - Just like a nail. - Well, then hurry up. - Then I'll wait for you down there. - It is fine. - Good morning, Sis. - Good morning. (Peter continues) - Owra. - It's pretty. I've seen one like that in a toy store. It was just smaller. You're full of nonsense, man. Of course it was smaller, otherwise it couldn't be in the store. - That's what I'm saying too. - Listen, someone is playing. (accordion music) It's Peter. Come. - Oh, no. Play some more. - Yes, play a polka, fiddler. Yes. Yes. Then come down here. it's so nice in the harbor when the summer sun is smiling and the box here in my arms I don't want any more then I pull with eagerness it whines and it beeps I dream a little and sing a little, but who do I see?: play a polka fiddler man show what you can do one with rhythm in it we like that press all the buttons that are fast in the boys just pull and drag like Popeye where he plays, he must not have studied the one you gave me when I was confirmed play a polka fiddler hit a trill if you can there has to be rhythm, just keep going And when the old shot takes off on the wall of the house with wind in all rags, I take out the box and the fish in the net get a polka-dotted line then I swing then I sing while the shot sails home: play a polka fiddler we have home'in polkaland it's good music and gymnastics let's have a dance ball av I broke my nut shell now give it some gas i sing bass dancing and singing it makes me so happy let me play you get a candy bar such an accordion, it's really nice to have now play one for us i dance skraa's When gentle waves whisper in the clear skies of the moon so every fisherman longs for the girl he loves she waits for him in the harbor and when he opens his arms then she hurries then she smiles then he loses his breath: thanks for the game fiddler you have shown us what you can do there was rhythm in it, we like that (laughter) - Good morning. - Good morning, Sis. What a serenade to be received with. - Yes. - It was crazy. - Do you want to go in the water, kids? - Not now, Sis. We are going to play with Keld and Hanne. - Do you want to come, Little Peter? - First I have to go home and get something. - It is nice weather today. - Yes, and it was yesterday too. Can I talk you into joining me in the water? - You can try it. - On what? To persuade me. What do you want me to do? Sit patiently? Woof! I want to go. I have my bathing suit on board. I'm waiting for you. (Indian howl) - I have captured the white man's daughter. - Save my life. No. Good, Yellow Wolf. Tell us when your father is coming with the stagecoach. - I'm not shouting anything. - We tie her to the totem pole. - Should she be tortured? - Yes. (shot) - Bummer, now he comes and disturbs us. - Oh, he must play along. Just be careful, Indians. Now the big elephant comes and frees the prisoner. - There are no elephants in America. - They are only found in Africa and India. - Can Bodil Kjer not play? - No. What about that dog? It's not a dog. It's a coyote. Shame. You never have to do anything either. It's just enough to take your tongue out. Doggie. (Indian howl) (laughs) Stop laughing, or you must not be a prisoner. Have you seen the dark clouds? (thunder) - Listen, it's thundering. - Now the rain is coming. Whoa, take me with you. Take me with you! Ole! Ole! You cannot be familiar with that. Come and laugh at me. - I just forgot about you. - What do you think, Per goes? He can handle it. (rain) Doggie, you're getting wet. Come into this cave. Sis, hurry up. - It's a proper rinse. - Yes, it quickly drifts over again. - Are you afraid of thunderstorms? - Nah, not a trace. - I'm sorry. - Why? Because I would like to comfort you. (thunderclap) It crashed. I guess I'm a little bit scared anyway. - Just get out. It's over. - Look, now the sun is shining again. (the dog barks) - It is so restless. - Look, there is something it wants to tell us. - It went together with Per. - There must be something wrong. (the dog barks) - I'm scared, Ole. - We can follow it. (the dog whines) The slope has crashed. Is Per down there? Hurry up and get something we can dig with. Take the dog, Keld. We must be careful. - It could be that he is not down there. - Yes, he is. I'm sure of that. - There's Sis. - Sis! Is there something wrong? We think the slope has crashed on top of Per. Don't be afraid, Mie. We'll probably find him. - Are you sure it's here? - Yes, we had a cave in this place. We must all take action. We use our hands. - Sis... - So, so, little Mie. Give me the boards. Start pushing the sand down with your hands. But carefully. I have to stiffen this. - Stop. There is something here. - Those are his shoes. He lies here. Stop looking here, Sis and Mie. Is he alive? Do you think he's alive? I do not know. (Mie cries) - What do you want to do? - Give him artificial respiration. He lives. Come on, come on, baby. - I don't have to go to bed now. - Yes, you can believe that, you need to. - Now be a sweet boy and lie down. - Well, I'm hungry. Aah, my God, that bit of crap. Then he must have a snack. You go down to your father. He is sitting in the garden with one of his killer books. - And they are sure he knows nothing? - Yes, and you shouldn't tell - - now that it's all well and truly over. - Yes, thank God. - It must be with roller rinse. - Yes, you should get that. - Who do we have to say goodbye to? - Lars, the others and then Keld and Hanne. - Are they not coming to the station? - No, they are going on the parents' car trip. - Goodbye, Lars. - Goodbye and have a good time. - And thank you for this time. - You're welcome. (huh) It's Mie and Ole. - We're just coming to say goodbye. - Yes, then we won't see each other again. Well, we also live in Copenhagen. My birthday is on 3 October, if you and Mie want to come. - Yes please. We would very much like that. - I have written our phone number. - Thanks. Then you'd better get ours too. - Well, then write. (Uncle Anders sings) Then I'll drive, Mrs Mikkelsen. That is, I go. I pull the bike so that nothing happens to the paintings. - How many did you make? - Seven. All together 'The sea in riots.' One more revolting than the other. (laughs) - Goodbye, Mrs Mikkelsen. - Goodbye, and come home safely. - Goodbye, Uncle Anders. - Farewell, little fisherman, farewell. - Where is Sis? - Yes, I don't know that. - I'm here. Good morning, Peter. - Good morning, Sis. It was nice of you to come. I thought you were going fishing. I will too, but I just wanted to say see you again. - I'll be home soon. - Yes, fortunately. Good morning. I just wanted to pop in and say have a good trip. - And I say: Thank you for the help. - With what? Oh, that with him there. Should it be another time. - I hope not now. - Well, but goodbye then. - Sis, then we're ready. - Well. - Where is Per? - He was just going to get something. (pig squeal) - He's coming there. - lh, gracious. I would like to take this home with me. (laughter) Yes, you can easily laugh, but we have him every day. Will you immediately return the animal again? Oh no. That is my friend. It can go at home on the lawn. - Nonsense and breeding, man. - Where did you get that pig? - Over there by the red house. - Come on, we'll hand it over. (pig squeal) - Will we ever say goodbye? - Yes, now we can. Your father is coming now, and the train will leave immediately. I think we'll have to save that kiss until you get home. - But save a whole lot. - Yes. - Where are the children? - They'll be here in a moment. Yes, I would certainly hope so. Well, goodbye, Mrs. Mikkelsen. It has been a lovely peaceful holiday. Yes, it has. - Then we are here. - It's many o'clock. Has anyone seen 'The Two-Egged Dagger?' - What kind of dagger? - My criminal history. I didn't finish it. I want to read it on the train on the way home. - It is at the very bottom of the suitcase. - Darnit! - What did you say?? - I said... Let's go. - Goodbye, Mrs Mikkelsen. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, bette Mikkelsen. A writes te dough, when a has learned to write. --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
