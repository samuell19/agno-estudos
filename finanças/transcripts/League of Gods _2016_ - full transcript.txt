In the beginning, there was a world of possibilities for all living creatures... But humans became driven by desire and ambition to own the world, and war began. Some got devoured by dark. Some became the guardians of light. A war to seal the fate of all humanity is imminent. No entry to the imperial bedroom. No rash action. Whatever you hear, no one is allowed to trespass. Yes, sir. Your Majesty. What a good appetite, my consort! You seem quite zesty these days. It's for better serving you, Your Majesty, and your Dragon Body. Lei, what time is it? The Big Dipper 'gust passed the zenith. We are just one mile from Zhaoge. Remember, we have only one mission. To rescue the Grand Elder of Invisible Tribe before dawn. Over the years, King Zhou has slaughtered numerous adept tribes. It's said that he's bewitched by Daji. He's merely a puppet of that Nine-Tail Fox. Captain, why don't we just take this opportunity to kill that evil fox? Only Master Jiang can wipe out this ancient Fox Demon. Now, our top priority is to find Invisible Tribe's Grand Elder and bring him safely back to Xiqi. Since we crossed the Zhaoge border, I can smell blood and it's growing stronger. I feel it's coming from a fox! Lei, when we are in there, whatever happens, make sure not to use your adept power! Daji's sorcery is unfathomable. Even a tiny surge of power, she can sense it. Roger that! -Master Jiang. -It's so rude of us. Please forgive Ji Fa. Listen to me. Never be too strained. A marksman never holds his arrow too long on the string. -Xiqi...! -Invincible! The truth is, there's a secret with King Zhou. In order to gain the world, he made an devilish deal with supreme demon when young. I can give you everything. -Okay. -I will own the world. I'm going to be the only king! But you have to exchange your body for it. I must get the world! He sold his own body to entice the Black Dragon with his royal blood. When the three suns converge, and Black Dragon descends, great dark will envelop the world... for 18,000 years. So Nine-Tail Fox isn't the biggest threat. -Actually, it's this Black Dragon. -What has it to do with Grand Elder? He's the only one that knows the secret of killing Black Dragon. If you can't get him out, it'll be the end of the world. We're saving him. What about you? Good question. It's something I can disclose to you. Anyway, get them out and leave soon. And you? How will you leave? I will leave just the way I come. It's the imperial prison ahead where Grand Elder is being kept. Here comes Her Majesty, Queen Daji. Your Majesty. Your gift is ready. Present the gift! The guards are changing shifts now. Save our Grand Elder... They are less attentive when they start a shift. After the handover after the handover will be the best time to take action! Save our Grand Elder... I can hear the Invisible Tribesmen calling! Come out now! The Invisible Tribesmen are just inside! We are the Ji Clan warriors from Xiqi. We're here to help you! I've eliminated the entire Invisible Tribe. What do we need their Grand Elder for? Of course, to us, he's of no use. But to some people, he can be used... to threaten us. With what? Because his eyes... Can store the past and the future. Your Majesty, I really want to know, after all, what your future is like. The cage is sealed with black magic. You can't open it. Even our hiding technique is sealed too, so we can't get it through either. Lei, don't use your adept power. The Invisible Tribe just used their power. Time is critical. The orphan of the Wing Tribe must be here. What is my future? Show me! It can't be. That's not what I want! You wicked tyrant! Your resplendent kingdom at the cost of millions of lives will end up a land of the dead. Your body will definitely be in the ruins as well! No! That won't happen! Gouge out his eyes! Yeah. Gouge them out! Where's Grand Elder? -King Zhou's men just took him away! -Let's hurry and go save Grand Elder now! He wanted you to save the children first. Please. Stay alert. Get the children out first. Benefactors, please take good care of the kids. And we'll go save... This is the sewer of the Sovereign Royal Court. Retreat from here. Prepare the boat! Is it time freezing? Enough! Do no more evil! Enough! Do no more evil! Are you tired of living, Jiang? How dare you trespass in the palace? It's a capital offence, don't you know? With your vain ambition, you don't even care about your life, do you? You just shut up! You old man. What a busybody. My son, you belong to the sky. Fly... You go first. JI lei and I will bring up the rear. What are you doing? Listen up! You are my brother and comrade-in-arms. Now I need you to fight a way out for them and complete the task for me! I'm General Leopard. With me guarding the palace, how dare you intruded! Rebels from Xiqi. Are you seeking death? I like interfering just because I'm old! Now my reign is supreme in the world. Who dares not to submit to my rule? Old bastard. You've been an ascetic for centuries. Don't overrate yourself. Show me how you're going to fight me. Humph. Do you think you can gain the world in such a heretical way? Come on, it's you who's overrated. The wings hung in my room could sense you. They must belong to your father. Let me reunite you with him now! Bridge the stream! Forward! With all your so-called legendary divination powers, Jiang, couldn't you tell this is a trap? You are disappointing! You too! I've long heard that Daji is the greatest beauty in the world. Too bad you're just a fox disguised as a human. Put down the floodgate! The exit is right ahead. We must leave Zhaoge before dawn. See you in Xiqi! He must know my story. Indeed I was able to sense those wings too. Lei. Our mission isn't done yet. Don't be absent-minded. Promise me you'll allow me to seek the answer after this mission. I'll make you young again with reverse-ageing curse. Reverse-ageing curse? Master Jiang! Go home to tell general JI I'll raze Xiqi to the ground. JI clan warriors have been long trained only for this moment! Master Jiang. Go now! Hey, let's... calm down, Your Majesty. They can't get away. Anyway, we have half won. Brother, we're back home now. They are back. Open the City Gate! His revelatory eye is with us now. What are we waiting for? People usually enjoy the full moon at night. But it's double moon. You can only see them at sunset. With just an eyeball, how shall we kill Black Dragon? An Invisible tribesman can see the stars behind the sun. Grand Elder's eyes have stored everything he has ever seen. He is the only one who's seen Black Dragon's nemesis. Though it's just one eye, we have got a fifty-fifty chance at least. I'm younger now. I was hit by Daji's reverse-ageing curse back in the court. Every time I exert my life energy, the curse accelerates. Would you like to try? Do I look handsome? But the price is, when my energy is used up, my primordial spirit will vanish. Doom is coming. Is it anytime for jokes? Whoa, don't worry. Winning or losing, alive or dead. Who laughs last will win the day. So it's the legendary Sword of Light? The Sword of Light is the only weapon that can oppose Black Dragon. So only Gold Dragon is capable of mastering this sword. The Sword has tremendous power. But it's more destructive if you can't harness it. That's right. It depends whether the swordsman has a heart for the world. I just want to see a world at peace again, rather than dying together with King Zhou. There can be fire on water and rebirth from death. We all have been through hard times, because what we are doing is not just for ourselves, but for the future of the world. For so many years I've prepared for the war against King Zhou. What Xiqi needs is to stick together, not to gamble everyone's life on this sword. -Well... It's not a gamble! -Humph. I know you don't believe in the Sword of Light. You don't believe yourself. Don't I believe you? Look at your face now. Soon you're young enough to call me uncle. Can you still play tough? The other eyeball is with baâ€œ. She knows something that we don't know. You... And I... Have no choice. I can't let them get the Sword of Light. Whoever wants to find the Sword I'll destroy him. You just want a pair of wings, but you never had the guts to fly. You really want to? I've tried. But I failed every time. I'm a Wing Tribesman who cannot fly. No one can teach you. Ask it here. Fly! Don't be afraid. Fly! Come on! My son. It's time. Spread your wings. Just fly! Don't lose heart. You're a Wing Tribesman. Sooner or later you'll have your own wings and fly to the sky. Come on. Catch it. What is it...? A map for a sword. The Sword of Light. The Sword of Light. It's looking for its master. Who is its master? Can I be the one? Its master must be smart, brave, righteous, with plenty of wisdom. The most important thing is he will never give up. I'm going! Are you? Children are counting on him. Grown-ups are counting on him. The whole world is counting on him. -I'll go! -Are you? You'll get killed! -I'm not afraid. -I must go anyway. It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! Treasure! Where's my treasure? Who is he? Your little companion for the journey, Naza. You recognize me, so did you hide my treasure? I see. My Wind Fire Wheels are not here! I'll go find them on my own. Don't follow. He will come back for you. Hey. Keep those three pouches and start the journey. -You'll find your companions naturally. -Isn't it a sword I need to find? Two things come from one. And three things come from two. With the third thing, you'll make it in everything. Make haste. Father, you really let him go on that? We have to let him face things alone through all hardships. Only then can he find himself. Find him and report his whereabouts. It's been several days. I didn't even see a person. Is it the right direction? Why didn't you ask me? Silly boy. Who are you? I'm the most important one of the three pouches. -I know anything. -Oh, then you can help me find the sword. It's nothing. With my power, it's totally a piece of cake. Just bragging, right? You brat. Are you doubting me? If it weren't for Master Jiang talking me into it, I would not have the leisure to help you. Humph. How shall I put it, without me, it's impossible for you alone to find the Sword of Light. Alright. You're great. Then show me the way. Not so fast. In the end things will mend. If the opportunity occurs, I don't have to tell you but you'll see where to go. OK. If so, you're not needed anymore. Are you not waiting for your friend? Once I give off my scent, he will show up real soon. Oh gosh. So stinky! You know nothing, green hand. No living creature in this world can resist my magical scent. They'll be attracted to me involuntarily. Really. Involuntarily. What a bragger. Can someone help me? Now you see. He's coming naturally. Impressive. Bravo. Help! It's Naza. -Now you know how good I am. -Can someone help me? Get him out now. Get me out of here! Hey. Watch out. He's really a sly boy. Really. It serves you right! Little bastard. Been stealing food and got caught again? Buried here as punishment? OK... Don't cry. -Wanna run? -Where else can you go? -Be good. -Be good. Listen to me from now on. This is mine. I'm quitting the game now. Give it back to me! Come get it if you can. Come on... You burnt me. If only I had my Wind Fire Wheels, I will smash you. Bring it on. What's this? What's this? I didn't expect to lure it out. Oh shit! Even this stuff is here. Desert centipede! Help! It's catching up! Don't follow me. Follow him. Faster! Get off if you think I'm slow. I'm not playing with you. You have fun. Over there! The centipede just wants you. I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted. Stay away from me! Stay away from me! Move! Move! Run. Help! You burnt me again. Out of my way! Baldy. I don't want the grass anymore. Now I own this pouch. Idiot. That pouch is meant to be yours! Little shrimp, the third prince. -So it's you? -Naza. You bastard! You tore down the Merfolk Palace and destroyed my home. You even extracted my spinal cord so that I can't grow up anymore. I'm sure my father will get even with you for that. Wind Fire Wheels I want my Wind Fire Wheels... Do they have an old grievance? Naza once made havoc in the East Sea. His body was destroyed. But Master Jiang kindly helped to retain his primordial spirit and restore his body. Yet, without his Wind Fire Wheels, he is always in a highly unstable state. Wind Fire Wheels! -Why did you tie me up? -Wind Fire Wheels! -I have to find Wind Fire Wheels! -Let go of me! If you promise to go on the journey with that silly boy, I can set you free. -Now let me go! -Promise me first. Just promise him. If not, he'll bore you to death. What do you mean? Who are you? Master Jiang said whoever tries to take a pouch from me is exactly the companion I need. Are you with that old man? I am with you, too. We'll complete the task he gave together. So this is how you treat your companion? Don't be softened. You just got cheated... What the heck is it in that old man's mind? Looking for the Sword of Light. To save the world? You don't want to help him? It's a good thing. It's mine now. Only I can lead you to the Wind Fire Wheels. I swear what he said is true. Damned baldy. Don't con me to help find the Sword of Light! You better help me find my Wind Fire Wheels, or I'll pull your spinal cord. Okay, it's a deal. Are we sorted? Then please let go. I'm dying of thirst. I told you it's not the right way. It's been three days and nights, but we are still going round. -Ji Lei. -Does this toy ever work? Master Jiang gave me this navigator. He must have his reason. We have to believe him. Only an idiot like you will believe that lunatic. If he's so great, why didn't he take care of it himself? There was no need to get pissed off. -What a huge city! -Look. No matter where we go, there won't be the wheels. Stop. Master Jiang sent us... No talking! -What is it? -It must be a good thing. -Why didn't I know that earlier? -Look. My Heaven's Bolt is almost completed. It's mine now. Don't mess up! Naza! Are you helping each other? Alpha Rings! Stop. Break it up! Get lost! May I borrow it for fun? Put it down! This treasure is mine now! Cut it out, Naza! Put it down! We're sorry. How could it be...? It should be able to resist both fire and water. Give it back to its owner. -I got it. -Nine-Tail Fox sent you here! I don't care what you're talking about. You know what, you hairy guy. You were fooled! This treasure is a fake. Everything here is false! No more crap, okay? Day after day. Season by season. No birth and no death. No other and no self. So what if it's a fake? So it's you, Yang Jian. We haven't met for decades. You got obsessed by the fox's curse. Why do you help me? Because we need you in Xiqi. Black Dragon is about to descend. Only Xiqi is the last hope to stand against it. What is it to me? You were once headstrong and attempted to kill Nine-Tail Fox alone. But you got trapped by her for decades instead. And now you've regained your Liberty. How can you sit by while that evil fox is harming the world? I just fell in her trap through an oversight. I, Yang Jian, swear to finish off Nine-Tail Fox! That's exactly what I wished to hear from you. We must stay united with one heart now. Hey baldy, give him the pouch. Sky howler? I knew it's you. Now, before everything else, we have to find the Sword of Light and return to Xiqi before the three suns converge. Let's go, sky. Let's find my gold armor. After I find it, I can defeat Nine-Tail Fox alone. Yang Jian, we'll see you in Xiqi! You are so rude. Keeping a dog makes you that proud? You didn't even say thanks. Damned baldy, you lured me here to fight a vain fight with that three-eyed guy. Where are my wheels? Don't hurry. Let's check the navigator. What the heck is it? Looks just like an olive pit. -You don't get it. -It's called Porta-Boat. It can take you anywhere abroad you want. Anywhere I want? No kidding! Just think of a place, and Porta-Boat will go there on its own. If it weren't for King Zhou's relentless invasion, these people would not become destitute and homeless... No sentiment. Hey. We've checked a dozen of docks, but haven't seen that stupid Boat. It's your bad luck. Let's do it separately! My name is Blue Butterfly. Can you teach me? -A map for a sword. -The whole world is counting on him. Save the world? Why do you help me? Because we need you in Xiqi. The next task is to follow this boy until they find Porta-Boat. Report to me all the way. Are you so easily distracted? You still have your proper business. Not really. I I I just did her a favor. You have to bear in mind Lady Taiyi's emblem. Porta-Boat is with her. But when you meet her, never ever mention Jiang. Why? No whys. Just do it. I'm here looking for... Everybody here must be looking for something. You check it out first. But I see nothing! Never look with your eyes. You should... Do it... With your heart. Is it the Porta-Boat that can go anywhere? -Correct! -Anywhere. And I'll go with you... We both want to gain awakening... We'll meet again someday! Someday... you'll come back to me to ask for it... You finally come back to me? Jiang. It's been 80 years. You finally come back to me? -Get out of here! -No. I'm not Jiang. I'm here for Porta-Boat. Who else are you if you're not Jiang? Why do you come to cheat me in this disguise? I'm not Jiang. I mean it. Jiang. You're back at last. It's been a long and tough wait. I won't let you leave me again this time. I'm Jiang? Travel around the world with me. Travel around the world? Hey! You can't get caught in her dreamland! Wake up! Now! I don't want to. Wake up! You know how dangerous it was? If I weren't quick-witted, your primordial spirit could not return. What's wrong with her? Don't bother. Porta-Boat is fight there. When she's still in the dream unwilling to wake up, let's get the thing and go. Hey. It's not right. Is Lady Taiyi here? How come you are here too... Who are you? The man who just showed you the butterflies... What butterflies? -I was just... -OK. Enough. I'm here to look for Porta-Boat! Porta-Boat? Only Jiang knows about Porta-Boat. Jiang, you want to steal my Porta-Boat? I'm not Jiang, Jong or Jam... You're a dead junk! Why is it so tiny? Give my Porta-Boat back! Run! The crazy bitch is coming! Which crazy bitch? That woman is really cruel! How cruel can a woman be? Give my boat to me! It's obviously an olive pit! It's a boat when it touches water! Throw it now! Hurry up. The witch will catch up real soon. Porta-boat is steered by mind. Be concentrated to open it. Let's set off! Where's boat heading? It depends on whose mind prevails. I want to go home. Little shrimp! What are you so noisy about? -Don't bully me. -I'm warning you. I'm quite hungry now. Don't bully me. Stop bullying him, Naza. We'll reach the East Sea tomorrow. In my territory, do you dare to... The Merfolk Palace? So what? I can go tear it down once again. I'm afraid, if we go there, we can't find the Sword of Light. Why does she know the Sword of Light? Who sent you here? -Naza. -Confess! If you don't confess honestly, I'll feed you to the sharks. -Let go of me! -Let go of me! Blue Butterfly. Why is he a kid now? Good for us. The whole world is at peace now. Move a bit more this way. Alright. It's the right direction now. How do you know about the Sword? Perhaps you won't believe it. I saw it from your memories. Why did you forget me just now? I don't wish to. I can't decide what to remember or what to forget. Sometimes, if you forget something, you have less pain to bear. Really? Is that really what you think? I was orphaned when I was young. I can barely think of what my parents look like. Do you want to see them? I can help you see them if you'd like to. No, thanks. Xiqi is my home now. It's almost morning. Have a good sleep. I never like sleeping. I fear I'll forget everything once I wake up... Why the worry? Let bygones be bygones. It's always a new day with a new start when you wake up. This is the first sunrise in my memory. I really hope I can remember it forever. You are too naive. This memory never belongs to you from the beginning. I can take it away anytime I like! Blue Butterfly. Leave me alone. I can't remember anything. I will forget it all! -Wake up! Hey! -Wake up! Are you really tempted? This girl is of unknown origin. She might be from the enemy. I don't care! I'd like to help her! Don't forget you have a bigger mission. Fossti. Fossti. Can you teach me? We'll catch that brat soon. And I must break his wings off then. Look. It's a brand new day. Where are we going? Where is it? Who are you? You forget things again. What do I forget? Is it important? Nothing. Just forget it... Just kidding. I do know who you are. I'm so happy! I can remember everything! The sunrise at dawn and the starry sky at night! And you, too. I hope you are happy every day! I don't want my memory to slip away anymore. I will remember every sunrise and sunset! As long as you have faith in truth, your dream will come true. Believe me. JI lei. Thank you. You are the reason I have my memory for the first time. Didn't we change its direction? How come it's the East Sea? So it's the third prince's mind that prevails. The Merfolk Palace is my homestead. I really really miss my dad. Go home. Go home. Go home now. Go home. Go home. I want to go home. Why is he so happy? Because we're closer to his home, I guess. You're back finally, my son. You're back finally. I want to go home. I want my dad. Bring the third prince and that little bastard here! Go home. Go home. I want... Little shrimp! Is your spinal cord tough once again? I'll strangle you. Go home. Naza! What are you doing? I'm going to save him! The East Sea is a test he is predestined to undergo. There's no way around it. And you should go on your own way as well. Soon you'll meet him again. Hands off me! You guys really know nothing. You don't mind if I tear down the Merfolk Palace again? Hi, again, brat. Do you remember me? Old shrimp. Did you steal my Wind Fire Wheels? Hand them over. You want the wheels? Do you know how much you piss us off? Take my advice. Return my son to me. You want your baby son? I just ate him. He's in my stomach now. You'll find him in the toilet later. Cut him open! Alpha rings! Alpha rings? I thought they're donuts. Why are you so blind? Take this! Extra arms? What's the big deal? Depth charge! Spear fishing! Now you see how tough I am, huh? Out of piss now? Come off it! Crush him! The big move is long kept for you. Indirect shock wave! Immortal fart! Divine thunder! Ground burst! Oh no! My palace is done for. Wow, a fresh crab leg. Ugly octopus. Don't go. Come play with me. Don't go. Stop fighting. Stop fighting. I give up. You stinky seafood. I didn't have enough fun! I'll return your wheels. Indeed as expected... my Wind Fire Wheels. Wind Fire Wheels. I'm coming! I can fly freely between heaven and earth again. No! No! Where's my son? Catch him. Dad! Dad! I'm home. I miss you so much. Now we're even. Where on earth is this Porta-Boat taking us? Seems this is our destination. Don't worry. It's so familiar here. It's the Floating Old City. What's this? Solar Bird! The totem of Wing Tribe. How did you know that? Wing tribe disappeared long ago. I engraved this. You did it? You've been here before? It is... It was my hometown. Now I remember. I remember everything. I'm from Wing Tribe. On the Flight Ceremony when I was exactly six, the Floating Old City was stricken by a fatal disaster. From then on, I never had the courage to spread my wings again. What do you fear? I just fear that, someday, if I spread my wings again, another disaster will befall the people I love most. Perhaps it could be Ji Clan warriors, or Master Jiang, or even... you. Promise me, go fly with me. I'm not afraid. Wherever there is Solar Bird, there will be light and hope! I got it! The Sword of Light must be there! The Sword of Light! We found it at last. How did he know we were here? Sorry... It's my fault. In fact he sent me to you... You are my friend! Snatch the sword! Now! Don't kill him! Who are you to say this? Please... Please don't kill him. Leave me alone. Get away now! I'll help you pull out the sword in exchange for his life. Master! Are you in love? Too naive. Once I erase it, you won't remember who he is! No. I will remember him. Shut up! You're just a chunk of wood! You are lifeless! Get me the Sword now! Don't! Don't! No! No! Pull the Sword! No! You are the only memory I want to have. Nothing is more important than you. Hold me tight. We must survive this! I remember you've said that. As long as you have faith in truth, your dream will come true. You can fly at last. I've promised to fly with you. Promise me one more thing... Don't be sad for me. I'm just a marionette... No! You are Blue Butterfly! Having a good day is better than living a lifetime I've seen the sunrise, but I still... Want to see the sunset... From now on, Solar Bird will always be there for me enjoying every sunrise and sunset with you... Baldy, you really have wings now. Is it the Sword of Light or what? Looks like a rod of charcoal to me. Cut the crap. King Zhou's troops must be at the City Gate now. Pick up the pace. You thought you've found hope with the Sword of Light. Then I'll give you the darkest and the most desperate day. Give Xiqi a bloodbath! Get hang back here to me! Father, can the octagon maze really hold back the enemy? You have to trust Master Jiang. He's a powerful sorcerer. I'm sure he can defeat them... Move! Go forward! What am I doing here? What am I doing here? How could it be? Qian and Kun trigrams are inverted; Kan and Li trigrams are... Master Jiang... What's wrong? That curse has changed you so much... General! The City Gate is in danger! My son, we've long trained our warriors just for today! Let's fight separately. I defend the observatory. You keep the City Gate with shield infantry. Yang Jian. I knew you'd come. Wearing gold armor now? Really commanding. Let's see who's faster. Father Commander, I'm back. Lei. You found your own wings at last. Fly high! Fly high! Father Commander. I'll leave the sword to you. Let's safeguard Xiqi together! OK! What a shame that an undefeated general got beaten by a brat. I I don't want to die! Alright. Now I will transform you into an immortal warlord! Master Jiang! Who are you? We're back with the Sword of Light! Old jerk. What's wrong with you? The reverse-aging curse is getting stronger. Soon his primordial spirit will be drained. Why can you guys fly? We're running out of time. -Kid Jiang. -Come over. Do you remember me? Who are you? -Get down here. -Sky howler. Let's hide the kid Jiang for a while. Don't worry. Worry? I just worry you can't keep up with me. Don't run. You're running nowhere. Oh my god! Daji's tail can even locate here? Are you here to play with me? Come on. Come on now! Come! Silly boy. It's no fun! Just run! Come on. Team tornado. Take the south side. Team Thunderbolt. Defend the north side. Father Commander. Father. This is one last chance. Carry the Sword... to the Spring of Life. Let light return. I'll entrust you with the safety of Xiqi. Xiqi! Invincible! Bro! Get going. Take it to the Spring of Life. Master Jiang... Where's Master Jiang? Jiang was caught by Daji's tail! The real Gold Dragon. We've got the Sword of Light. Let's kill Black Dragon now. Don't hurry. It's all just as Master Jiang predicted. Xiqi! Invincible! We'll storm Zhaoge. Jiang... you don't have the Sword of Light, while I'm armed by Black Dragon. Killing the Dragon with a Sword? What a terrible joke!
