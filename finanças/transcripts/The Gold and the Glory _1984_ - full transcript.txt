(energetic music) (tense music) (exhaling) (man speaking in foreign language) - [Teacher] Over, and pirouette. (speaking in foreign language) Up and (speaking in foreign language) Turn and arabesque. (teacher cuing) - [Teacher] One and two, and turn, arabesque. Ready, and, (speaking in foreign language) (Teachers speaking over each other) (tense music) - [Teacher] Three and four. We'll go again. From the 18, thank you Mary. (speaking in foreign language) (woman humming) It's impossible to exaggerate practically. The more you love, just prove yourself to be a man. And to do this, he's prepared to risk everything. His life, even his love for you. He is bent on self-destruction. And there's nothing you can do about it, only love. But there must be hope. And there must be love. For sometimes that is enough. It'll give you all that leaves. Trying, hoping, loving. And let me see it on your face! Pay attention, concentrate, please, Kerry. (women laughing) - Okay, see you tonight. - Wait. - You're so slow. You want a lift? - Hi. - Hello. - You're a great dancer. - How's your mouth? - Oh that, that was nothing. I wasn't watching. I got distracted. - Kerry. - Is that your name? - Yes. - Kerry. (grand music) (revving) (truck honking) - [Announcer] And here's the champion grand champion of the Winterside Cream bird classic. The favorite, the national live band champion grand champion. Champion of all four mains of the Ironman race, the run, the swim, the 30 and the Malibu board. Grand Champion National Champion all set for the Ironman racing today. Fancy the swim lake first then the surfing lake, followed by the Malibu board. And finally the beach. (tense music) - You've done the work and now it's gonna pay. Never doubt it! The only man you gotta beat is Kenny. And you're gonna shit on him, you got it? Have you got that? Do you know it? - I know it. - Don't know it here, know it here! Never doubt it! The others don't even get it. They're not even there. They're nothing. Kenny's the titleholder. And it's your name, and it's your day today. You're gonna go out there and you're gonna rub his nose in it. You're gonna hurt him. You're gonna push him until his arms are jelly. His legs are jelly. He can't swim, he can't pedal. And he can't run! - Yeah. - You're at your peak and the strongest you've ever been. Nobody can get close to you, they can't touch you. Do you know it? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yes! - You gonna win? - Yes! - Yes! - Yes! - Yes! - Ah, you're the best! You know it, oh you goddamn man, oh. You're the best! Where the hell have you been, you check the surf? - It's the same. Left right break and riff at the north end, Adam. - Get next to Adam at the start. I want you to pace him for the run. I want him up with Kenny at the end of the run. - Yeah. - For Christ's sake, will you put a bit of effort in on it? - [Man On Radio] Mike, it's set down for the ironman race. The safety craft is standing by. It's the perfect day here on the Gold Coast with the swell running five to six feet and a huge crowd. - [Announcer] It's a race to combine fiximum physical endurance and the skills of the lifesaving movement. And the draw for today's race, surf skis for the first leg followed by the beach run, the swim leg, the Malibu board leg, and the final beach swim for the finish line. And with time to get that stop sand-- - He's all fat, mate. Don't worry about him. You can beat him. - Yeah, lot here, come on in. - Sure, man. - Come on, get off his back. Let him settle down, yeah? Yeah, yeah. - Seems all right. - Yeah. - [Announcer] Here it is, the ironman race. The premier event, an explosion of energy. Like running a marathon at a pace of a 100 meters dash. A matter of will, a race of strength and endurance, soaking up the punishment. The grueling 12 minute race. The swim, the surf ski, the Malibu board and the beach run. The fittest athletes in the country for the Peter's Ice Cream surf classic. Four separate legs in the race. Four circuits of the course. They'll swim out and back, they'll surf ski out and back. They'll paddle those Malibu boards out and back and of course the sprint through the soft sand to the finish. (tense music) - [Marshal] Ready! (gun firing) (energetic music) (splashing) - Go! Go! (waves crashing) (announcer getting drowned out by waves) (cheering) (inspiring music) - [Announcer] And here comes the champ turning his way. The Olympic medalist (mumbling) And they come out of the boats, (mumbling) (cheering) (puffing) (energetic music) (bubbling) (huffing) - [Announcer] (mumbling) the Malibu board. (splashing) (splashing) (cheering) - Run, Adam! (groaning) - We should have stayed to congratulate him. - You wanna be a good loser, do you? A good loser? You keep going the way you are you're gonna be one of the best losers around here. Ah, don't let it get to you. He beat you on the day, that's all. Learn from it. But don't brood about it or he'll have you psyched out next time before you even start. - [Adam] I'm not brooding about it. - Ah, if you'd had any luck on that wave on that board leg, you'd have done him. With the ride you got you should have moved up three places. - What? - What? - What did you say? - Oh Christ, what's the use? Don't you even care? - Shit, yeah. (light music) - You coming to bed soon? - In a while. Go through the race in your mind. Every leg of it. Try and work out where you lost it. You'll feel where you lost it. Then go through it again. Only this time you win it. See yourself leading him. Crushing him. Leading him up to the tape and breaking it. Go to sleep knowing you're a winner. - Only not today I'm not. - Adam! - I let you down, didn't I. I'm sorry. - I'll wake you up at five. You better get to sleep. Five o'clock start. - Right. It's the group, they're great. - What group? - Oh, it's a surprise. If it comes off, I'll tell you tomorrow. - Bloody kid. - Look, I think they're terrific. They're great but, musically I wouldn't know. I can't even whistle. That's why I got a bookie. You should call my booking agent, Paul Hirsch. - Yeah I know. I've talked to him. Paul's terrific, a great agent.

(laughing) - I'm supposed to be working. - You do this for a living? - That's if you don't get me fired. - Listen, I need to talk to you. - It took me two years to get this job. - Okay. I'm sorry, I'll go. - Listen. I'm a dancer. I work 12 hours a day, six days a week. And at night, I study. - Yeah, well I just saw you, that's all. I didn't know you were a star or something. - I'm no star. I'm a lead dancer in the second smallest professional company in the state. - Only not for long. - That's right. By the time I'm 20 I'm going to be dancing with the Sydney Ballet company. And I'll be principal with the San Francisco Ballet before I'm 25. - You gotta eat. - I don't have time for, for anything else. - All I was thinking about was dinner. - No you weren't. And neither was I. That's why you have to go. (somber music) - Arms held, Kerry. Three, four, five, six, seven eight. One, two three. Watch your stop. - How's your luck? - I don't even know the guy. - Come on Kerry, (mumbling) - Come on girl, quickly quickly. Keep your mind on what you're doing. Six, case, and one two three four, five six seven eight. - I tell you what. You take this one and I'll have his brother. - If you don't mind, I'd like to work. - That serious, is it? - Keep your mind on what you're doing. (fast energetic music) (growling) (men hooting) - Come on, Adam! I could still run you fellas into the ground. Come on, let's have you. Hup! Hup! - Who's taking this load into town? - You're volunteering, are you? - Somebody has to. - Ah yeah. That'll be the last we see of you if you're off messing with those muso mates of yours. - Yeah. Something like that. Sorry. Can't keep it up, eh? - (laughing) Cheeky bastard. Keep it up a damn son, longer than you can. Come on, let's have you. Ho! Hup! Well that's it. You got a 10 kilometer run in the sand from surfers down to Tallabagera creek. Then a five kilometer swim down to the next creek and then another six kilometer beach run down to Coolangatta. You got a couple of headlands to cross. A bit over 13 miles total for the run swim lakes. And that only gets you halfway. Don't underestimate it. It's the toughest damn race anywhere in the world. It's a full natural course marathon. Five, maybe six hours. - Sounds easy when you say it fast. - Better you than me, mate. - Thanks. - By the time you get to Coolangatta, you'd have lost about half of them. - Yeah, I bet. - It's 20,000 dollars prize money. If it was easy it'd be 20 dollars, they'd have girls doing it. (zooming) Okay, the halfway mark. Your surf ski's gonna be waiting for you here. Now you gotta be leading Kenny here, the end of the run and the swim. If he's ahead of you here, you're never gonna catch him on the ski. You gotta be ahead of him. Right. Take your ski, out to the surf, straight paddle back to Broad beach. Final run home. - 26 miles. - I can train with you. - Can you do it? - Yeah. - Do you wanna do it? - Yeah, sure - What do you mean, yeah sure? What sort of an answer is that? You going into it like that, you've lost it before you've even started. Do you wanna be in it? - Yes! - You gonna win the fucking thing? - Yes I'll win! - Right! (laughing) I think Adam should go on the Coolangatta Gold. - He can't. - Why not? - He just can't that's all. It's too hard. He's not trained for it. - He will be. We got three months. - It's not his race. - It's not Grant Kenny's race either. He's in it. - So that's it. - Yeah, that's it. You beat him in this, your last results won't mean a damn thing. - He tried, he did his best. He almost beat him. - Almost. What the hell is almost? Who the hell remembers who came second? - Who remembers who came first in 1960? - I do. You beat him in the Coolangatta Gold, you'll have him psyched out in every race you go against him. You'll eat him. - [Mom] It's too hard! - Think of the sponsorship you'll pick up. You'll be set for life. - Nothing to do with that and you know it. He can't do it. - All right. Let him decide for himself. - It might be him deciding. - It's 20,000 dollars, mom. - It isn't the money. You think your father cares about the money? If your father cared about money, we wouldn't be, - What? Go on, we wouldn't be what? You said you liked living out here. - Don't take any notice, Steve. Everybody fights. - Who won the Ironman title in 1960? - Hayden Kenny. Grant's father. - And dad came second? That was the best he ever did, wasn't it? - That's got nothing to do with it. - Are you happy here? - Of course I'm happy. What a funny thing to ask. (light music) (puffing) (bubbling) - You're releasing too early. Adam! You're releasing too early! (puffing) - What about vitamin supplements? - Why, you feeling run down? - No, but I'd like to take them. - Yeah, and all they get is the most expensive piss in town. (bubbling) - Steve, will you pick up the pace? Jesus, that's what you're there for! (energetic music) (huffing) - [Steve] Hi. - Hi. Is that what you do? - Running? - Yeah? - Hell no. There's no money in it. Not unless you're at the top. - Isn't that what you're training for? - Nah. Adam's the athlete. I just work out with him. - Well what are you then? - There's a place called the Roof Garden. You know it, it's sort of a nightclub. - Yes, I know. - Well if you come there with me tonight I'll show you. Well what I wanna be anyway. I know you don't have much time. It's just for tonight. It's important to me. - There's a ballet on television. I'm supposed to be watching it with a friend. - Him or a her? - Her. - No worries! Bring her along, Adam will be there.

How bad is it? - I don't know. - Was he bleeding? - No. Ah hell mom, I don't know. - Steve? I phoned. They said you were here.

My mother. - Hello, Mrs. Lucas. - Are you a friend of Adam's? - Yes. - What happened, Steve? How did it happen? - He had a few drinks. I didn't mean, - He was drunk. That bloke in there reckons he was drunk. - He was a bit. A bit. Yeah, he was. - It was you, wasn't it? You got him drunk! - [Steve] I didn't want him to. - You did it to him! You wanted it to happen, didn't you? He's in there because of you! You couldn't match him and you couldn't beat him and so you tried to cripple him did you, you little shit? (shouting) - Don't you raise your hand to me. I'll break your bloody arm! You wanna have a go? Go on, have a go! Come on, have a go! You won't. You won't will you? 'Cause you haven't got the guts! You're not half the man he is. You know it! You've always known it! That's why you did it, isn't it? That's why you did it, isn't it? You wanted it to happen, didn't you? You wanted it to happen. Well you, talk to me you little shit! You wanted it to happen, didn't you? You couldn't match him, could you? He beat you at everything you ever tried and this is how you get back at him, isn't it? - Yes! Yes. All right? And don't you ever touch me again or I'll kill you. - Steve! Steve, please wait. It isn't true. It isn't. - It is. - You didn't cause it. - It's true. - You got him one drink. Go back and tell him. - All the rest of it's true. Leave me alone! Go and see Adam. (somber music) (screaming and banging) (weight clanking) - What are you going to do about Steve? You have to tell him. You can't leave him believing the things you said. You've got to tell him it's got nothing to do with him. You and me. And the rest. Please, Joe. - What can I say to him? - Tell him you love him. As much as Adam. - I'll speak to him. (grunting) Adam's all right. He's coming home this afternoon. I didn't mean what I said. - Yes you did. But that's all right. It's true. - No, it isn't. - I'm leaving. I'm moving into town. - If you do that, that's gonna be the end of it between your mother and me. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to stay. - Good day, tiger. Sorry about last night. - It was my fault. - I was the one pissed and that got to be your fault. - I shouldn't have given you the vodka. - I'm not a baby, you know. You didn't force feed me. - Yeah, but I conned you into it. I wanted to get you drunk. - What bullshit. - I've been a pretty wretched brother, haven't I? Always have been. - Come on, knock it off. - And I really mean it. I was glad when you got done by Kenny the other day. I wanted you to get beaten. - Why? - 'Cause if you don't look so good then I don't look so bad. - Jesus, you're a clown sometimes. - Yeah, anyway. It was my fault so I'm paying for the bikes. - No you're not. I am. Handle the race prize money. - You're not still going, are you? - Why not? - Well, I thought your training will be messed up. - Haven't got a scratch. - Well listen, I'll train with you. I mean seriously, not messing around like I used to. - That'll be great, but, you don't have to. - But I want you to win this. I mean I really do. - So do I.

I could beat Adam on the run and match him on the ski leg. - You never have. - I've never tried. I know Adam's terrific. I hope he wins this. I really mean that. But just once, just one time I'd like dad to notice that I'm not too bad either. - He's proud of both of you. He is. I know he shows it more to Adam but that's just part of the training. Psyching, that's all. He feels the same about both of you. - Has he said that to you? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. (somber music) (inspiring music) - Easy mate. - Come on mate, go for it! - What's the matter with you? Three quarter pace. Didn't I tell you three quarter pace? Can't you do anything right? - Dad, I beat him. I could win it. I could win the race for you. - What if you pulled a muscle, where would that leave us? Haven't you done enough bloody harm already? - I beat him. You just don't like me beating him. - Beat him? With a fair bloody start, you couldn't beat him on the best day you ever have. - I'm all right, I'm all right! - Go on, get out of it. Get out of my sight! You've done all the damage you're gonna do. I don't want you anywhere near him, you hear that? I don't want you anywhere near him! - Yeah. I know. I want you to train me. - [Gary] For what? - I wanna win the Coolangatta Gold. - Enter it or win it? - Win it. - Why? - What the hell does that matter, Gary? Will you train me or won't you? - How badly do you want to win it? - More than I've ever wanted anything. - Then you can do it on your own, you don't need me. - All right, I will. - Steve. The why does matter. If you're doing it for the wrong reasons, even if you win it, there'll be nothing in it for you. - Oh, yes there will. (piano music) - [Miss Angel] Watch the line, good. - Steve! (intense rock music) (grunting and panting) - Phil, have there been any messages for me? - Not that I know of, Miss Dean, sorry. - Thanks. (light orchestral music) - God's sake, Kerry, you're like lead out there. You're dead. Could you stop worrying about him and remember what you've been working for? (exhaling) (tense music) - Woo! Woohoo! Woo hoo! (triumphant music) woo hoo! Woo! Woo hoo! Woo! (clanking in distance) (tense music) - What are you doing still up? - Oh. Couldn't sleep. - Yeah. Too hot. - Yeah. It's a hot one. A bit nervous about the race. - Yeah? - I don't know, mate. I don't know if I can beat him or not. I don't even know if I'll finish the damn thing. - [Steve] You'll be right. - No I mean. Do you know what the old man's like. He thinks I'm some sort of champion or something. Maybe I'm not a champion. Never will be. I don't even wanna be. - Listen Adam, I'm, - Yeah what, mate? - Nothing. - If I can be ahead of Kenny at the end of the run I'm in with a chance. I know I can't catch him on the ski leg. He's too good for that. But if I could be leading him just after the run, I might do it. This time I could really do it. - I'm going in the race myself. - No. - It's got nothing to do with you. I'm not doing it against you. - You're going in the race? Bullshit. No you can't go in the bloody race. Listen. Nothing, you going in the race, you say it's got nothing to do with me. Do you understand? - Yeah and-- - Do you understand what you gotta do if you go in the race? You gotta beat me. - It's got nothing to do-- - It's got plenty to do with me! You wanna beat the old man, you gotta beat me. All right. I can beat Kenny. I'm psyched up for it. I can hurt him. I can beat him but I gotta break him. I don't wanna beat you. - I don't think you can. - You wanna find out? - Yeah. (thunder rumbling in distance) You do it every night, don't you? - You still awake? - Every night. You go in there and check on Adam, never me. Not since I was eight years old. - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. - You're still a baby, are you? Want me to tuck you in or something? - No. Not anymore I don't. I don't want anything from you. I'm going in that race tomorrow and I'm gonna beat the shit out of you. - Fat chance. Not on the best day you ever had. (energetic music) (cheering) - Talking about the race today, we have 55 competitors taking part in this Ironman marathon event. Competitors and watchers from around the country have arrived in (drowned out by helicopter and crowd) - Neal, have you seen Kerry? - No I haven't, Steve. - Joe. - Yeah. Come on, Adam. - Steve? Don't do it to him, Steve. Don't make your father come second again. He doesn't deserve that. - I've been coming second all my life. - Don't let Steve psyche you out. He's no problem. He's not gonna last. There's only one man out there you gotta beat. That's Grant Kenny. - Yeah, right. - You can beat him, Adam. You gotta believe that. You're stronger than him and you're faster. You've done the work, you can win. - I'll do my best. - Don't just do your best. Be the best. I know what I'm talking about because I didn't win. I did my best. It doesn't mean a damn thing. - It does to me. - Well it doesn't to me. You got to win it, Adam. You got to. - I will. - I know we will, mate. I know we will. (crowd chattering) - Yeah. - At least his muscles are working. - [Announcer] These men will be on their way. A five to six hour journey to be described in midway nobody could find anywhere in the world. Could all the Coolagatta Gold competitors go to the marshaling area please? To sign on the grid position. Could all Coolagatta Gold competitors please go to the marshaling area now. You know there must be 30 to 40 thousand people past here on maybe for the start of this race. - You're Steve Lucas? - Yeah, good day, Grant. - Hear you've been doing a lot of miles. - [Announcer] One of the nation's premier sporting events is about to get underway. (tense music) (gun firing) They're on a way and it's a good start. (crowd cheering) (energetic music) - [Radio Announcer] Awesome event this race is, it's more demanding than a marathon, more dangerous, and certainly more spectacular. Then again it's one of the most beautiful beaches and coastline I've seen anywhere in the world. - [Announcer] Definitely down a little now working on the attendance. Now laying in running this race. Each man trying to put his stamp on the event. And these should be 55 men trying with himself and top five in the next five hours is going to have to draw on, (crowd cheering) (clapping and cheering) (radio chatter) - [Announcer] You know I have the feeling the company's all they need to take the lead. But that will take because we're all about in for the race. Nobody really knows what the pace ought to be. (energetic music) (mumbling) And then of course this long run right along the beach towards Burly. It looks as though Adam Lucas is running very well at this stage. In the middle of this moment running. And it would appear as though Steve Lucas and Grant Kenny are running shoulder to shoulder. And of course Grant Kenny one of the pacers of this race today. (energetic music) (exhaling) Now one of the competitors, that is number 49 Steve Lucas is going over the top of the mountain. Now this is a perfectly legal alternative. As why you go that way I have no idea. It's shorter, but it's one tough way to do it. I definitely a very much more steep of the race. Adam Lucas, end part of the running now the model pack leading the pack down towards (mumbling) And good run from Adam to get in front of Grant Kenny. Here they come running their way out of the woods now there towards the (mumbling) And it looks like we have another runner by Adam. (mumbling) Number 49, Steve Lucas! Crazy going over the top of the mountain but he's coming out home. And he's the leading competitor, 49. Leaving the mountain race. Steve Lucas now front. Followed by brother Adam and Grant Kenny, (mumbling) - [Reporter] An hour 25 into the race now and they're getting ready for the three mile ocean swim. I have the feeling the Lucas brothers have been setting a pace faster than Grant Kenny would have liked. Going on Steve who has taken the lead by that perfectly legal but extraordinary tactic of going straight up over Burly hill. Whether it's part of the family race strategy, I don't know. (splashing) And there's been another change in the lead here in the swim. Yes there has. Grant Kenny. Grant Kenny has overhauled the Lucas boys. - [Announcer] He leads the team of Adam Lucas. (mumbling) Grant Kenny is out in front. And I'll tell you what if they can't catch him before they get to the halfway point of Coolagatta, well it will be a one man race. (huffing) (huffing) - [Reporter] Getting up towards the halfway mark now. - [Announcer] Here comes the halfway mark of Coolagatta Gold. About 200 meters to run and so they pick up the speed. And there he is, Grant Kenny out front. - Come on mate. (huffing) (crowd cheering) (splashing) (huffing) - [Announcer] Comes around the water now paddling back towards Surfer's Paradise. The Lucas brothers have put up a tremendous effort but now in front is Grant Kenny, the national ironman champion. - [Reporter] Heading for home now and it's Grant Kenny leading the way. He'll likes surf ski, so he'll open a really big lead on Adam back to Surfers Paradise. And a modern four feet swell running as they get off shore. They're on the last leg now. 12 miles still to go. (rock music) 100, 150 yards behind him. But it's hard to see them keeping up this grueling pace. (huffing) It's number 16, Ray Taylor from Perth. We had reports earlier that (mumbling) And Taylor is out of the race. Ray Taylor from Perth. (energetic music) (crowd cheering) (waves crashing) (crowd cheering) (waves crashing) (huffing) (crowd cheering) (energetic music) (huffing) (intense music) - Adam! (crowd cheering) Adam! - Yay! Woo! - Look! Adam! (crowd cheering) He won! - Go! - We won! Oh! Hahah! (triumphant music) Adam! That's my boy! Adam! Adam! - Thank you. - Thanks so much, son! You're a champion! Haha! (crowd cheering) Makes it worth it, Adam. Makes it all worth it. I told you you can do it, son. You're a bloody champion, you're the best. Your whole life's gonna be different now, Adam. You can have everything I ever wanted for you, mate. Bloody champion! Woohoo! Woohoo, haha! (triumphant music) (calm music) - You're ready for that knee down grading now. - (sighing)I don't think I need it now. - I know. That's why you're ready. - Thank you, Gary. (triumphant music) (orchestral music)
