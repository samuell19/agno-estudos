- Some people are surprised. They say you know, until my child had it, I had heard about food allergies but I never really knew what it meant. - I didn't realize how serious it was until I experienced it myself with my son, and it really scared me, I was shocked, it really scared me. - The doctor just said this is something I just have to deal with. Even though I've eaten it my whole life it doesn't matter, it can change overnight, and it did. - The common misconception from the older population is that oh, it's a food allergy, that means just don't touch it because you can get a rash and it can cause a little bit of skin irritation. That's one of the major misconceptions that we are dealing with, and it can lead to a lot of family strife as well where the grandparents think, "Oh, Johnny can have "a little peanut because it'll "cause a little bit of a rash," whereas the parents and Johnny knows that it can be much more severe than that. - You know, I guess I get frustrated with people who think maybe that Will's allergies may not be as severe as they are, you know, or is this really real? But when they see him when he's in the ER and the doctor's listening to his chest and they notice there's no air moving, then they know it's real. I guess people think oh, food allergy, oh is this a little tummy thing, or a tummy ache or a little diarrhea? And in his case it's not what it is. - Then there's other people who just can't imagine that food could be dangerous. They can imagine that bee stings can cause anaphylaxis but for some reason food just doesn't seem dangerous to them because it's what we need to live, to grow, and they can't imagine that somebody could die from it. - One of the hardest things to get people to understand is there is no difference in terms of the type of reaction that happens when someone gets stung by a bee, so a honey bee or a yellow jacket, and the type of reaction theoretically you can see when ingesting a food or in fact, taking a drug that a doctor may give you. They're all the same parts of the immune system going awry. We certainly didn't have anybody sit us down and say this is going to be a family-changing and a life-changing experience for someone who will appear 99.9% of the time healthy and completely normal, which you normally would be excited about except that when you show this normal happy child to someone and say, "You give them the wrong thing "and they may die." It's just too hard for them to comprehend. - It's frustrating to me when you try and explain it to people and they don't understand what anaphylaxis is to begin with, so you have to explain that to them; and when you tell them that food can actually cause that, sometimes they look at you like you're crazy. It's very difficult to explain to them it really can happen, I've seen it happen with my own two eyes, I've had to give epinephrine to my son because he's blown up into a big hive from drinking a glass of milk. - I think the reason that people often find it hard to accept that this is such a significant problem is we eat food every day. If you don't live with a food allergy, it's hard to even imagine that something as simple as peanut butter, that is just a staple part of the diet, or a tree nut or fish that most people eat every day without a problem, how can that hurt you? It just doesn't even make sense, it seems impossible. Even as a physician that takes care of children with food allergy every day, I still think it's bizarre that something you would eat can, for some people, kill them. (gentle piano music) - There are multiple foods that can cause allergies. In fact, any food can be a food allergy. - I'm allergic to tree nuts and coconut. - [Man] And then what's Emily allergic to? - She's allergic to sunflower, eggs, peanuts, and I think tree nuts, too. - I'm allergic to crustaceans; shrimp, lobster, crab. - I'm allergic to nuts, peanuts, eggs, milk. - It's a really long list. Poppy seeds, sunflower seeds, peanuts, all nuts, sesame, chickpeas, lentils, - Chocolate. - Chocolate. - I am allergic to a lot of things. I'm allergic to sesame seeds, sesame oil, tree nuts, seafood, shellfish, mangoes and strawberry seeds. - I am allergic to fish and most legumes. - He's allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, sesame seed; he's also allergic to beef, pork, rice, lamb, and peas. It's a long list. (laughs) - The most prevalent foods that we see in children, and in fact the general population, are things like soy, wheat, egg, cow's milk, and of course peanuts and tree nuts, and fish and shellfish. We tend to link them all together in these large groups. There can be other foods, however, that fall outside of that 80% range that can cause food allergies. We're seeing trends now in sesames, other legumes, other foods of any sort can be a problem. - [Audra] I've gone to their allergist and actually had their allergist create a letter for both of the girls stating exactly what their allergies are, that it's life-threatening, almost like validation because a lot of people don't understand from the mom. I come off to other people as an anxious overbearing mom, sometimes I feel, because I'm very protective of my children and their allergies. It's almost like I needed extra proof that no really, this is a life-threatening situation because people tend to kind of blow it off. - And when someone mentions that they have a bee allergy everyone's aware that oh my God, this can kill that person. Whereas for whatever reason, food allergies, it falls into a different realm. Part of this falls back to this generational gap where food allergies are increasing much more nowadays, or were much less present 40 or 50 years ago, so that generation never was exposed to it. So they think a food allergy will cause a little bit of irritation and rash. Part of the disconnect, I think, between bee sting allergies and food allergies is that food is commonly eaten every single day and most people tolerate foods without any difficulties at all. Most people think of their food allergies as being well, I get a little cramping or bloating, like lactose intolerance, and they think oh, that's what a food allergy is, just avoid it and you're fine. They don't realize how it can be life-threatening. - Mark and I both have seasonal allergies, and Mark took shots for 18 years when he was a kid. I took shots when I was older, seasonal allergies shots. But we didn't know, you know, that our likelihood of having a child with allergies would be higher, but it is. But interestingly enough our younger son doesn't have any allergies. - [Boy] Zip. - Zero; he has a little bit of eczema but that's about it. - Early on, and this will happen in probably a not-so-humorous way with some families, it's like who do you blame? It must be your genes, it must be your genes. And so Laura says that my mom has multiple allergies and my brother, so maybe it's the gene pool on our side. But as you know, if you look into this, it's a mixture of fate and genetic pool and some other things. - Very often parents will come in saying I have hay fever, my husband has hay fever, why does our child have a food allergy? And I always use the example of if your husband's allergic to cat and you're allergic to dogs, your allergies are what they are. Your child doesn't eat cats or dogs. If you put a cat or dog into somebody's mouth they're gonna get the same itching, the same sensation as if some child were to put a peanut, milk, or some food they're allergic to. It's a cultural choice. We don't eat those foods, we don't see those things here, that's why we don't have those particular problems. But the same potential, the same reaction's happening, it's just that in the parent it happens to be to dog or cat, and in the child it happens to be to a particular food but it is the same type of reaction and it's the same response in the immune system's happening. - It's interesting growing up with food allergies and then having a family and having children. Trying to deal with the introduction or the discovery that our kids had food allergies was a surprise, and it shouldn't have been. (laughs) We're both in science and we're both, we should have understood that there's probably a genetic component to it. But we didn't understand. - [Isabelle] We didn't think about it. - [Roger] Yeah, we didn't think about it and we also didn't think about how life-changing it would be. - Well genetics definitely plays a role. We typically will see families that have kids, or families that have asthma, eczema, allergies, and they'll tend to have more food allergies and it tends to run together as atopic diseases. - We've actually done studies about genetics of food allergy and so we did a study in peanut allergy, looking at twins who are either identical twins where they share essentially all their genes versus twins who are fraternal, they only share about half of their genes; and the rate of food allergy was much higher, over 65%, in the identical twins, but 7% in the fraternal twins. That says that it's very genetic but also there are environmental influences. - But we just don't know what turns that switch on or off for different patients as to why they suddenly become allergic or not. - [Scott] So I have a lot of families that'll come in and their child's been diagnosed with a food allergy to something, and of course as being humans we want to blame it on something. So lots of moms will say oh, I must have eaten something or maybe not eaten something while I was pregnant or breastfeeding that caused this allergy. Well the bottom line is that based on the evidence that we have today, I could certainly say to a parent there's no reason for you to be on a guilt trip that you ate or didn't eat something. The studies are, unfortunately, limited and sometimes unclear on this, but there isn't strong evidence that what a mom eats during pregnancy or breastfeeding causes an allergy. The problem is that our studies are limited. I can't say for sure that it's not related, but there have been many studies on the topic and yet there's no conclusive evidence. - Food allergies are not something that we've done to our children, it's not something that just happens solely during pregnancy or how you fed your child in the early parts of life. Food allergies are a genetic component as much as they are an environmental component, in that it probably stemmed from the original genetics of the family, what the family's genetics was capable of, and that certain situations make it arise in other families versus others. The difficulty for families is families are searching for answers, and there's never a simple answer. It's easy to pinpoint processed foods, the way you eat, the timing of when you eat something. Well maybe those things do have an influence, but it's not the complete answer. (melancholy music) - I got my allergies through pregnancy. With Tory, about six weeks postpartum, I made myself a tuna sandwich like I normally would have and I noticed my mouth began to feel funny, my lips swelled up, my throat swelled, and I had a feeling I knew what was going on. So we went to the hospital. With my second pregnancy it wasn't quite as severe. I noticed after I had some vegetable soup, I noticed hives on the outside of my mouth and I didn't want to believe it was happening again. So the next day I had something else with beans in it and sure enough I began getting the hives again. - We found out he was allergic to sesame oil and sesame seed because I had given him some lip balm in the car on our way to church, and he was eating candy, had an allergic reaction and we thought it was the candy. We tested him for everything in the candy, got to the ER, and really it took us a while to figure out that he was allergic to sesame. - [Melissa] I first learned about my son's food allergy when he was about seven months old. We had a week where we thought he had in intestinal illness, but he actually turned out to be passing blood in his stools. We took him to the allergist, he had a history of eczema and wheezing, and it turned out to be that he was bleeding intestinally. We basically determined that he was allergic to milk. - On Emily's first birthday I was very excited to bake her her first birthday cake, and it's tradition that she gets a big piece, eats it with her hands, and you know it's funny to see the children with the frosting all over their face. So I gave her a piece of the cake and we sang Happy Birthday, and almost instantly as she's eating the cake she started scratching her hands and was starting to cry a little bit. And I thought, "Well that's kinda strange." It's her birthday, she's eating cake, how exciting for a one-year-old to have a big piece of cake in front of them. And I realized something just wasn't quite right. I looked at her hands and she was covered with white hives on both of her hands. So she was crying because her hands were itching so badly and she was scratching them to the point where it looked like they were almost going to start to bleed. So it was kind of sad to see her so uncomfortable at her birthday, we're all staring at her, we had all sung Happy Birthday, and she was not obviously enjoying herself because at the time I didn't realize that she had an egg allergy. And sure enough, there were eggs in her cake, and I think that is what sparked the reaction in her hands. - The biggest dilemma when we deal with children is communication, children are unable to describe how they feel, and by the time a child can physically tell you how they feel or emotionally tell you how they feel they are probably having some significant symptoms, and misinterpretation by parents very often is a key mistake. - So she would cry and we would interpret that as meaning she was hungry, so we gave her some more milk. And the more milk we gave her the more she cried, and the more she threw up, and had diarrhea, and had more symptoms. So it was sort of a vicious cycle that we had gotten into. After nine long months of dealing with this condition and the constant crying, we finally got a diagnosis that said she was allergic to milk and eggs. - [Laura] We had given her peanut butter, and she just started reacting right away. She had hives on her face, she had hives where she had touched the peanut butter with her hands. At the time she was 18 months old, she wasn't talking, so she was kind of whining and crying and we knew something was wrong. - And the first time we gave it to her she didn't want to drink it but she put her hand in her mouth and she had a rash on the hand. Then the second time she had it she had a little bit mixed with breast milk, and then she was sitting down. Is that what you were gonna say? - Yes. (parents laugh) Excuse me, but it was almost like projectile vomiting. It was pretty amazing. - Like the exorcist, you know? She was sleeping and suddenly her eyes opened up and whoo! (laughs) - [Roger] So it was pretty clear that there was something wrong. - I use my daughter at times, whether she likes it or not, as examples of how to sort of go about things for our own life experiences with our child. My daughter, for a long time, was being given peanut butter purposely to try to desensitize her; what a lot of families ask to do at points; and we thought her food allergy had disappeared. We'd gotten to a point where we all felt confident it had gone away. And she went through this particular part of this protocol to see if this were to go away, and all of a sudden one day she looked at us and just asked us at age four, "Why do you keep giving me that food "that makes me feel so sick?" We finally started to ask questions of what she felt, and she told us that it made her ears hurt, which later on became ears itch. And when she was able to describe this and she wasn't getting the food any more she said, "Oh, it made my throat feel funny." These were words that started to come out of a child that was having sensations really that only when she was able to tell us did we understand. That was a big lesson for me. For someone who takes care of children all the time and as a parent, understanding your child's development becomes really important. Things happen to children. The child, the toddler, that refuses to eat something of course that's normal behavior at times, but sometimes in a food allergic child it's your first clue that something's not right. And when you ask histories well and you talk to families enough, they'll go back and tell you, "He never would eat an egg. "Every time we'd try to eat an egg he wouldn't eat it. "He would always put down the French toast "and he wouldn't eat it. And then we found out later on he had a horrible reaction to egg. The baby did it before he could even talk, and that's usually what happens, and it's very common. Milk is that way, egg is that way, peanuts and tree nuts can be that way for families. They will tell you later that when they sat down and thought about it, they'll realize something was happening and the kid was telling them something that they didn't understand. (gentle piano music) - So there are people who may have a reaction to a food and wonder, is there something about a substance in the food that made them allergic. Someone bites into an apple and gets an itchy mouth, they might think, "Oh, I'm allergic to a fertilizer "on the surface of the apple," but really the allergy is to the protein that's in the peel of the apple. You see it's the natural protein that's in the food that the body's immune system is attacking, it's not other parts of the food. So for example the sugars or the fats or the other components of the food are not the things that trigger the allergic reaction, it's the protein. - What typically happens is an antigen or a particular foreign protein is recognized by the body; whether that's through skin, oral contact through the mouth, eye contact. The immune system recognizes that particle as being foreign. It sends cells to attack that particular particle, and those cells release other types of chemicals to help destroy what the body perceives as something dangerous. In a food reaction sense, the major and most common substance that's discussed is histamine. It's the same chemical that causes the runny nose, itchy eyes, sore throats, that come with seasonal allergies but in large amounts. So when a person reacts to a food, this can cause significant changes; well beyond just the itching, runny nose, and hives; but can, if released by enough cells in the body, cause the GI complaints which are the stomach cramping complaints. It can change your blood pressure and cause the heart issues. It can cause release of histamine and other types of chemical mediators in the lungs and cause wheezing and shortness of breath. Because this particular chemical is located all over the body, concentrated in places such as the nose, throat, mouth, stomach, heart and lungs, you potentially get all these things happening at once and finally cause the dangerous part of an anaphylactic reaction. - She just had this different look about her. Her face started to go a little bit of pink, and her eyes started to glaze over. She just didn't look right. Then her breathing was affected, and her blood pressure was probably dropping because she stopped responding to our questions and stopped talking and so forth. - Analphylaxis is defined as a multi-system or multi-organ event in the body caused by an allergic reaction. It can manifest itself in many ways, most commonly hives which are rashes on the skin, as well as breathing issues; wheezing, difficulty and chest tightness, shortness of breath issues. Also in terms of stomach issues or gastrointestinal issues, vomiting, diarrhea, significant cramping. Of big concern however, of course, are the cardiovascular issues; changes in blood pressure causing what's called a loss of blood pressure or hypotension which can potentially be life-threatening. Some people have noticed neurologic symptoms. Some patients complain of what they feel is an impending sense of doom. They can feel that something bad is gonna happen to them but can't describe it any further. Young children will describe this. Itching can also be another complaint which is a painful type situation for some children, and how children interpret how they feel can vary. We all believe that anaphylaxis isn't just one thing happening to the body. The real definition is multiple things happening at the same time. So very often someone will break out in hives on their face or their lips or their arms, but in addition to that start to wheeze, cough, and then ultimately vomit. The worry is once more systems are involved the more deadly or theoretically dangerous a particular situation gets. What makes it scientifically hard to understand is nobody knows exactly what the next reaction will be. And what gets very confusing for patients and why vigilance is important is that some people will have reactions that seem very minor at first. At the next exposure or the next time the reactions could appear to be 10 times worse. Or, more importantly, somebody could have a reaction that completely appears out of the blue and seems to have no explanation whatsoever. (gentle piano music) - [Scott] We've seen an increase in asthma, in allergic rhinitis or hay fever, and also in allergic skin disease; and we think we're seeing a rise in food allergy as well. So why are all these allergy-type problems increasing? The main theory that people talk about these days, and it's just a theory, it's called the hygiene or cleanliness hypothesis. To sort of boil that down, the idea is that our body's immune system is supposed to fight germs. Well, we're using lots of antibiotics and vaccines, and we're living pretty clean lives. So that immune system's looking for something to attack. Without all those germs to attack, it might attack harmless proteins like animal danders, like pollens, and ultimately even proteins in our food causing food allergies. - Other misconceptions about the hygiene hypothesis is it has nothing to do with how you and I wash our hands on a daily basis. It is based on how society has changed over time and how we address systemic illness and global illness. Washing our hands more tomorrow, getting more vaccinations tomorrow, living on a pig farm tomorrow in Iowa, is not gonna make food allergies less a problem for your family. The process has already started, the genetics are already there, and it is a society-based issue versus an individual family. (gentle piano music) And if you look at a survey of people around the United States, almost 40% of people will tell you they have changed their diet at one point in their life because they felt they had a food allergy. That's contrasted by the actual percentage of people who have true IgE-mediated allergic food allergy which is at the most 6% in children and probably one to 2% in the adult population. We manipulate our diets more for lots of reasons that we don't understand, and it's misunderstanding. Lactose intolerance, which is the inability for the body to break down lactose sugar which is found in cow's milk can give people sensations of cramping, diarrhea, upset stomach, which sound very similar to anaphylaxis in food allergy but is not an allergy. - [Ben] We worry about food allergies as being the life-threatening reactions, the ones that can cause anaphylaxis. Whereas food intolerances basically encompasses all the other reactions to foods that are not IgE-mediated; the cramping, bloating that you get after eating foods is a food intolerance. Whereas hives, trouble swallowing, vomiting, that fits more of a food allergy. - [Harvey] And again, the general population tends to misunderstand that and blame everything on allergy. Because of that I think we see the definition of allergy, how the public perceives allergy, as a catchall phrase for all sorts of problems. (wondrous music) - I would say that the most important test for food allergy is a conversation. That sounds a little bit weird but the history about what's happened is the most important part of the food allergy evaluation. How much of the food was eaten, what happened when it was eaten, were the symptoms consistent? There are all kinds of details that the doctor, the allergist, wants to know and needs to know in order to say is this a food allergy, is it some other kind of thing that looks like a food allergy but is not? That's a big difference. Then when it comes down to things for testing, we have basically three major ways of testing. We have allergy skin tests which is just scratching the surface of the skin with a little bit of the food to see if it causes a little swelling, a hive that we're able to measure and look at to think about whether that's pertinent or not. There are also allergy blood tests that look for a protein that your body makes called IgE antibody that can trigger that allergic reaction. Then there's actually a feeding test which is done under a doctor's supervision of course, because if the tests are not so clear whether there's an allergy or not, sometimes we have to watch someone gradually eat the food to see if they're able to tolerate it or not. (gentle music) - But there is a lot of emotions that come along with the diagnosis of food allergies, because it tends to be something that can be life-threatening and when they hear that for a young child, that this can be something that affects them on a day-to-day basis when everyone has to eat and be exposed to these foods, how do you deal with that? - By the time they drive home and think about what am I gonna feed my child for dinner, it starts to sink in. This is bigger than I thought. The doctor says avoid milk, but as soon as you go home and start reading labels you realize that's more than just not drinking milk. That involves a lot of foods that you never realized that milk was in, and it's the same way with any allergen. - Um, I never really gave it much thought before. I knew it affected people, felt bad for them, but I thought well, you know, it is what it is. I thought it was along the lines of you're allergic to cats so you stay away from a cat. But now that my daughter and I are both allergic, I've become so much more aware and it's definitely changed our way of life tremendously. - It's kind of like getting hit by a bus. And I would say now, as life progresses, knowing what can happen to him if he is exposed to allergies; I wouldn't necessarily say it's more like waiting for a bus to hit you but it's kind of like navigating a mine field. - Everything is a danger. Going to someone's house, you never know when they're gonna pull out some food. Learning to have thick skin, to say no. Being able to identify all the different things that could be a danger. It's everywhere, it's in soaps, food is in shampoos, hair spray, lotions. So our lives have really changed in the manner that we've had to scrutinize everything we do, everywhere we go. - The thought of having a third child has been a question that my husband and I have been wrestling with for a while; because number one we have, with our second daughter, we don't know if she's got any allergies yet and she's got a five to 25% chance of developing a food allergy. So we could potentially have two food-allergic children and that's definitely a concern. With the thought of having a third, we know we're running that same risk of having a third child with food allergies. It's not the end of the world but it's definitely something that affects your life in such a way that you don't want it to happen, and it's a real concern. I had talked to my allergist about this recently and he had said that if we end up having a third child he would recommend that I would feed the baby hypoallergenic formula for the first six months. For me that's a personal struggle because I breastfed both of my daughters for 15 months. Everyone talks about how breastfeeding is the best way to go, and to hear my doctor tell me that no, that's not the best way to go, it's really hard, really hard to hear that. So the thought of again, having to forego all the benefits of breastfeeding for the chance, not even a guarantee but just the chance that the baby might not become food allergic is really hard; as well as the fact that for myself, I might develop another food allergy. The ones I have currently might become more severe. So it is a really difficult decision we're faced with right now because we have very seriously considered having a third, and one of the biggest reasons we're leaning away from it is because of these allergies. - Families understand that it's very difficult what we ask them to do; and the fears and concerns we have as parents sometimes overwhelm what we may think logically, and that's difficult. - [Audra] Yeah definitely, I'm very anxious about it and it is stressful. But when you are faced with a situation like this you just take one day at a time, one event at a time. If they have a birthday party to go to, well, this is what we have to do for it. They fully understand that there are certain things that they can and can't have. I don't think they understand the severity of the situation but they're little, I don't feel it's important to tell them it could possibly kill them if they have this delicious-looking cookie because to them it's just a cookie and to me it's a cookie made out of poison. - A friend in high school who died from a nut allergy and you know, it was a case where they had a chocolate bar, which is known to have nuts, and she ate it. It was tragic because all her parents, I'm sorry for going into the details but this rings in my mind all the time; that all her parents heard upstairs was the thud of her hitting the floor, so that was the end. It certainly resonates when I think of that as a parent. - Every death from an anaphylactic reaction is horrible. I've seen it, it's something that you'll never forget. To talk to a family afterwards and tell them that that's what caused their child's death is just the most horrific thing you could ever imagine. It's unforgiving and it will always haunt me thinking of those situations. But I have to put that in light of all the other bad things that have happened to people during the day, and the world; and we can do some things about this and be reasonable about this, and that's what I want. I still go places with my daughter. I take her to places where there are peanuts and we feel okay. We're protective but we still go do those things. (gentle piano music) Once we diagnose a child with a food allergy, the next question is when will it be outgrown? - We've had a lot of people say when Tori was first diagnosed with the peanut allergy that oh, well she's gonna outgrow it because most kids outgrow it. And we've had people say well, just try, after a few months just try it and see. If you give her a little bit maybe it'll be gone by then. In the very beginning it was hard because there were some people that didn't understand that this is very serious, this is something that she's probably not going to outgrow, and even a very small amount can hurt her. - My mother always says to me now, "Do you think he'll ever outgrow these? "When will they retest him again, what's the likelihood?" I said, "You know, no, unfortunately, "with the type of allergens that he has, unlikely. - [Woman] Very. - [Beth] Not gonna happen. - [Woman] Very, very, like none. - [Beth] So I wish, they'll retest him every so many years, but the likelihood of it going away is very small. - [Audra] In my children's case, especially Emily, because she's so highly allergic to the foods that I've said before such as sunflower and peanuts and eggs and tree nuts, there is very little chance that she'll outgrow those food allergies, it's highly unlikely. The only food that her allergist did say that she would most likely outgrow would be the eggs, and that wouldn't be until elementary school. - Our daughter Mariel outgrew her allergies by the time she was about eight years old. She then could drink milk and be exposed to milk protein and egg protein in a variety of sources, including eating ice cream which she is very pleased about. - And although we do believe that the majority of food allergens, particularly milk and egg, will be outgrown by the child by the time these children get older, there are some food allergies that will persist longer. And yes, most commonly peanut and tree nut and shellfish are more life-lasting, or can occur later in life unexpectedly. (gentle music) So as we treat anaphylactic reactions, our major treatments we have immediately are things like antihistamines, medications that block the release of a histamine-like chemical in the body to keep these reactions from happening. That's why when someone has hay fever or allergies they use medicines that block antihistamines. The second chemical, if that goes beyond that, is epinephrine; and epinephrine is essentially adrenaline. What we have available now is injectable adrenaline which we've used for years in this country to treat all sorts of physiologic issues. But in an anaphylactic reaction this chemical reverses the detrimental effects of histamine. It increases blood pressure, it causes what's called vasoconstriction of blood vessels throughout different parts of the body or reduces swelling overall. So it can combat hives, stomach issues, lung issues, and of course the heart issues. Right now our only choice in epinephrine is an injectable form. It allows the medicine to distribute quickly into the body, enter the bloodstream quickly, to combat the worries that we have with anaphylaxis. But because it's injectable people do have a natural fear and apprehension of having needles placed into them. - Interesting thing that I would not have expected is any child, and most adults including me would have been not scared maybe, but at least a little put off by them coming at her with the injection, because they actually drew up the epinephrine in a syringe with a needle that she could see. She was able to let them do that and then afterwards said, "Oh, it really wasn't that bad, "so now I'm not scared of the EpiPen "if I had to use it on myself or "if somebody else had to use it." - It wasn't a fun feeling in the car on our way there. It was getting more and more difficult for him to breathe and he was getting more and more uncomfortable. So as I was driving he pulled out his EpiPen and gave himself a shot in the leg as we were, (clears throat) sorry, as we were driving through intersections. - [Beth] Red lights. - [Mark] So I was kind of running red lights and made it to the hospital. - The point is to try to avoid having those severe reactions. I mean we know the level of antibodies that Zoe has to peanuts, she has a 100% chance of reacting. We don't want to know if it's going to be anaphylaxis. So we're avoiding it completely. But they have enough experience to know from these tests that she has a 100% chance of reacting to peanuts. (laughs) So yeah, we've been lucky and we have not had to use an epinephrine pen on them. - You're waiting for that next food allergic reaction to happen. It's going to happen at some point in time, I know it is, so the best thing for us to do is to be prepared. We always make sure that we have his medication with us. Right now we've actually started to transition that to him and it's his responsibility to carry it now. We have a little case that he carries and it has the epinephrine injectors and his asthma inhaler, because he's asthmatic as well, and it has his antihistamine in it. We just make sure that no matter where we go when we leave the house, whether there's gonna be food involved or not, that we take it with us. - [Will] I always have my epinephrine with me and a lot of other things, like I have the epinephrine, I have my inhaler, I have all that stuff. I just have a med bag to carry it. If I'm at school or something we can carry our backpacks to class. - [Beth] It's always with him. - [Will] So I throw it in my backpack. - So we always have them on hand in case there is an emergency. If we're going on a walk, we're not sure if the girls are allergic to bees. Because they do have some of the other allergies including seasonal allergies, there's a strong possibility that they could have a reaction to bees. So if anything were to happen along the way, or if they were to see a delicious looking M and M or a piece of candy on the sidewalk and they pop it in their mouths, we're prepared. With a life-threatening food allergy if there's going to be a reaction it happens within seconds and time is of the essence. You really have to react almost immediately, and if you don't have your medicine with you it's a life or death situation. - When we look at fatalities, when people and children die of their food reactions, it usually always is because the epinephrine was given too late or not at all. It's always better to err on the side of being conservative and offer the epinephrine earlier, even at the mistake or the expense of not needing it at that point and giving somebody a medicine that they may not have needed. For the very young children, epinephrine itself is a relatively safe medication when given in appropriate doses. The major concern we have is with older individuals, older people who have heart disease, other medical issues have become complex that too much adrenaline or epinephrine can cause significant problems. Thus anything that increases heart rate, causes blood pressure to go up, especially an older individual, the major concerns are heart issues that come up. But for the very young children and young adults it probably isn't an issue at all. We would encourage people, however, if they've used epinephrine to head to the emergency room for further evaluation. There are other medications that the hospitals will have available that can be used if things are not going quite as well. But epinephrine is a good bridge. It's a bridge to get yourself to more medical attention and it does have approximately a 15 to 20 minute working effectiveness and can be repeated if need be. (gentle piano music) Airborne reactions are probably one of the most feared types of reactions for parents, children, and older individuals. The most common one that's discussed is peanut allergen that's airborne, and there's a confusion between what's a true airborne allergen versus just noticing the smell of peanut butter or peanuts. Peanuts have a very volatile chemical that can be smelled from far distances away. The true airborne reaction, however, is typically related to particle-sized amounts of antigens that are put into the air in aerosol forms and inhaled. That gets absorbed by the lungs or the body itself and then causes an anaphylactic reaction. It can happen, it can even happen with peanuts and tree nuts but typically more with dusty-type environments. So peanut shells or hulls at baseball games are much more likely to cause a problem. A lot of people always bring concerns about airlines and flying on airlines with the use of peanuts on airlines and whether or not that can cause an airborne reaction. Theoretically it could; however it's extremely difficult to create that much airborne allergen in a particular area. What's more common however is an individual will smell something that is similar to what they're allergic to, smell peanut butter. Most likely what that triggers is a natural avoidance reaction, just like you and I would smell a skunk and become worried that a skunk is coming into the room. What's very difficult though is the initial panic and concern that someone exhibits; throat tightening, unusual sensation in their body. It's very well often related to the actual panic of being in a very scary situation, and it gets misinterpreted for an anaphylactic reaction. People can have airborne allergens, they can be dangerous, but are less common than I think most people perceive. So although airborne allergens are the most feared of all allergens, they're least likely to happen. What's more common in very young children however are contact reactions, especially amongst toddlers, because of the inability to wash hands and control themselves. This often gets misinterpreted for airborne issues, especially in the very young. Contact ultimately is what becomes important, hand-to-mouth contact of toddlers which is what we've always encouraged parents. Washing hands is probably your best defense against these allergens and problems. (gentle piano music) - One of the most important aspects of treating food allergies is avoidance. One of the key aspects of that is label reading. So any time you put anything into your mouth or in a child's mouth that has a food allergy, you have to make sure that that food allergen is not there. This would entail label reading which is a new concept for families that are newly diagnosed with this. They have no clue before about label reading and now as opposed to reading for calories or fat, now it's reading for peanut products or milk products or soy products. That's a big change in their lifestyle, it's a big impact that that can have and it takes a lot of time to get used to. - I remember when I first went to the grocery store when he was first diagnosed. - Took forever. - It took, it seemed like it took five hours. I walked into the store thinking, "Oh my God, this stuff could kill him." - [Laura] In order to keep her safe from all these foods, we essentially when we go grocery shopping we need to call all the manufacturers of all the foods that she eats. So in the case of her allergy to sesame unfortunately most manufacturers in the United States don't label for it. So you know, I'm running down the aisles picking up food, read the ingredient labels, and often enough there's something that says it's natural flavors or spices or flavorings, and I usually end up having to call them. So we spend hours on the phone talking to manufacturers asking them about their ingredients. - So what's the story with food labeling? Well, a great thing happened in January of 2006 and that's the Food Allergen Label and Consumer Protection Act came into effect, and that meant that different from before, I used to have to give my patients like a dictionary almost, like they were scientists, that words like casein meant milk or whey meant milk, who would know? Or products that say natural flavors, well who know what that is? They're not even telling you. But as of that law coming into effect, now the labels have to say in plain English words the allergens that might be in there with some exceptions. The law covers milk, egg, wheat soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and crustacean shellfish like shrimp, lobster, and crab; and it has to say the type of tree nut or the type of shellfish that's in the food. So that has made life a lot easier, it's no more guesswork, it's no more calling a manufacturer to try to figure out what they're talking about. No more carrying a list of words that mean milk or egg or soy with you. You can just look at the label and figure this out. Now, there are some limitations of the current law which still cause confusion. First of all, the law doesn't cover everything. So if you have a sesame allergy it's currently not in the U.S. labeling laws; it is in the labeling laws for some other countries. Currently without sesame on the list or some other seeds for that matter, well sesame is kind of like number nine out of the big eight food in food groups. So if something said spices, maybe that company thinks spices and sesame are the same kind of thing, and you would have to call the company to find out. I have a sesame allergy, is this food safe for me? It says spices and I'm wondering. - You still have to read the label every time. One time you might buy a certain box of crackers and you know usually that box of crackers is fine but there could be that one time where they had an accidental contamination, or they might have changed their recipe and as a consumer we're not aware of it. - What we are seeing now though is a proliferation of statements on labels such as "may contain an allergen," or "made in a facility with an allergen." Those types of statements are typically used when there's a risk because of the way the product is manufactured, perhaps it comes in contact with the allergen and they can't ensure that it's safe. But because they aren't regulated, we're seeing so many different versions of those statements that consumers are frustrated and some of them are trying to make choices. Like well, does made in a facility mean it's safer than if it says may contain? You can't really judge that, but it's confusing for people and the bottom line is if there is a statement like that, the safest thing is to avoid that food if you have that allergy. (gentle piano music) - Because it does take quite a bit of time and energy in preparing food for my children; I try to make sure because they have so many food allergies and allergies to other things that they eat wholesome foods that are very nutritious, that are as close to the actual form of the food as it's supposed to be. I'm finding that the fewer ingredients, less preservatives, things like that in foods tend to react better with them. - Again one of those things since you're reading the labels and you have to be careful about what you're eating and we make a lot of things nearly from scratch. We're not going off into the fields and grinding our own wheat or something like that. But with that, we have fun cooking food together. - [Heather] So that's one thing that we do cook from scratch a lot more now because we know what's going in it, and that makes us feel a little more comfortable with that. - [Melissa] You have to take precautions in your kitchen if you do have those allergens in your home to make sure that the cooking surfaces and whatnot are not cross-contaminated with the allergens. - My mommy brings me things that are really special and she looks up all the recipes to see if I might like it, and she bakes it if it doesn't have anything in it that I'm allergic to. Oh, and if I'm not allergic to it my mommy calls me to the kitchen and she tells me if I want to help her, and I do. First I look at the recipe picture and it looks good so I want to try it, and I tell my mommy. - [Deb] It's important to focus on preparing good things that your child can have and not to convey your sense of loss to the child, because the child is happy. The child just wants to be healthy and have good foods to eat, and can, if you work together and have a positive attitude about it. - I did go online and basically found recipe books, because it was hard to cook without wheat, dairy, eggs. Especially the first birthday cake for Zoe's birthday was awful. But over time they actually have come out with a lot of products, and now you can live it pretty well if you know what to look for. (gentle piano music) - [Scott] In terms of restaurant eating which our studies show is one of the biggest areas impacted in terms of quality of life and living with a food allergy; sometimes I'll tell families to go ahead of time without their food-allergic child and talk about getting a safe meal. A lot of times families will find a restaurant that works real well for them and they'll go back repeatedly; but every time they have to explain what the story is for their child, just to remind everyone. - Are you gonna feel comfortable asking the restaurant, would they be capable of cooking a meal for him. We've done that a few times and (sighs) both of us sat there like eagles, hawks watching him, just waiting for him to get sick. - So we try to make things as normal as possible. We still dine out as a family. We know where to go and what restaurants are more accommodating than others. We obviously want to make sure that our children are safe wherever we take them. So not only do we go to places prepared, we have wet wipes, things like that to wipe their hands off in case they touch anything. We avoid restaurants that have peanuts on the tables. A lot of steakhouses have the peanuts where they just shell them and throw them on the floor; we know that we can't go to those certain places. And we are always prepared with bringing an antihistamine medication in case they do have a reaction, and also having their epinephrine pens. - And what we find is very important is to really clearly communicate that this is an allergy. It's not like I just don't like milk, it's really an allergy. Those words that I suggest people use are things like my child is allergic to this food, even a tiny amount could make them sick, send them to a hospital and potentially even have fatal implications. So I really need to be sure that this food is clear from what my child's allergic to. I also suggest using written materials like a chef card or a handout that explains a little bit about cross-contact issue, food touching other food, shared utensils, et cetera; so that the family really could meander their way and get a safe meal. And usually it's fine, restaurants are very receptive to making sure that they're doing it right. They don't want a problem either. - Actually that's how we pick our restaurants, we pick the ones that understand and you know that they're doing something particular. There's a restaurant here in Ann Arbor where they, one day because one of our children is allergic to wheat, the other one is not, the guy in the kitchen came out and said did you know that this contained wheat? The thing that I had ordered, and I said yes but that's for the other child that's not allergic to wheat. But some people are very conscious and more and more conscious, and they will come out and they actually know. They have procedures in some restaurants on how to cook for your food-allergic people because it's getting to be more known. (gentle music) To make sure that they don't come in contact with foods, I guess what we have done is really educate them. From early on, that's the first thing we did with her was no, you can't eat this, this is not your food, you're maybe allergic to this or you're allergic to this. She was so little, you know? One day I was looking at ingredients on a container of mustard, wondering if she could have it, and she goes, "No, I allergic that." She took it out of my hands, put it back in the fridge. (laughs) - Well as he gets older he learns more about himself. One morning I almost gave him the wrong milk and thank God he recognized it and he said, "Daddy, this is not my milk." It was my mistake, my mind got caught up on something else, the phone rang at the same time, so I gave him the milk, this and that, and it was the wrong kind of milk. He stopped me (snaps) right then and there. And that was very nice, that was very smart of him. - Tori's in dance class and whenever there's like a special holiday a lot of the moms want to bring in a special treat and I think it's great. I'm one of those moms who wants to do the same thing, too. But nine times out of 10 they're bringing in cookies or cupcakes or candy. I still remember the very first time we had to encounter one of these situations; Tori was in dance class and she was only three years old at the time. One of the moms was passing out these Halloween treat bags and inside of it were like peanut butter cups and different types of candies that had peanut butter in them, and I saw that, and that was the very first time we ever had an experience like that, and I, you know, my heart stopped and I thought, "Oh my goodness, we've got peanuts here." I took the bag and I said, "Thank you very much." I didn't want Tori to have it because at the time she still didn't quite understand that she had the allergy, she didn't know what it meant. So I took the bag and I thanked them and I explained to the mother that we couldn't accept it. When I took the bag from Tori she thought she did something wrong. She got really upset because she saw every other kid had one of these treat bags and she didn't. I just, my heart sank because here she is feeling like she did something wrong. I made up for it because when we got home I quickly put together something special for her and I promised her when we get home we'll have a special treat. So I was able to compensate for it in that way but it's true, any party you go to, especially kids' birthday parties or any holiday, it is based on food. - We tell I would say everybody that all food is dangerous to her until proven otherwise. So we started out by saying well this is bad and this is bad and watch out for this one. Then the list just go so big we finally said she's a smart little girl, big girl now; she'll get her food eventually. No food goes in her, or as best we can control, unless we know what it is and we've tracked it down and everything else. - [Audra] Madelyn knows that she can't have certain things that people give her, that she can't have candy. If we go trick-or-treating it's a little difficult because there's a lot of candy and things like that that she gets. The first year that we took her out when she was diagnosed with food allergies, Emily was not even one and she was almost three, and every door that we went to she would say, "Does this have nuts in it? "Because I can't have nuts." And you know, the people would just kind of look at her, and I'm kind of laughing thinking she's well-informed at three years old, it was kind of funny. But I had to explain to her that we would just sort out the candy when we got home. And that's what we did, we kind of had an exchange program. I had candy that they could have, and we just did sort of like a swap and she was perfectly happy with that. - Just educating the rest of your family about food allergy is a challenge. - I've caught people at family gatherings before asking about it. "Well he can just have a little bit." No, you know? No, he can't have anything, you know? He's very good at it now, but when he was much much younger I remember running across the room to stop my grandma from giving him a bite of her cake. She didn't understand, "What to you mean? "It's just one bite," and one bite is all it takes. - The reactions from our family and friends have been nothing but just concern over, especially for Tori's well-being, wanting to make sure that she's able to, for example at parties, participate, and they've found the right products to help her. In the beginning people were not too sure about what it all meant, and we didn't either. We thought it was as easy as just avoiding peanut, avoiding fish. They've come to understand now through our education that it's more than that. Everyone's understanding of that and they go to great lengths to ensure that we are able to go to family functions and have safe things for all of us to eat. - People need to share with anyone their child comes in contact with that this is a serious matter and that avoidance is the only way; avoidance to the allergen is the only way to prevent a reaction. - [Harvey] In stages, what we typically see, especially in the school system is the families who are in kindergarten and first grade for the first time letting their children leave the home are usually the most upset, worried, and panicked. - [Laura] Creating a safe environment for her isn't just by meeting the teacher for five minutes and then sending her off her merry way for the rest of the school year. It's a continuous education, continuous dialogue with the schools. - Usually I sit at my own table where I could sit next to somebody if they don't have any peanuts or anything. If they do, then they have to sit way far away from me. - We're very fortunate we go to a school where they understand that, and so we're able to put in multiple layers of defense, and they take all those layers very seriously. The fact that they're all present that's what keeps Katie safe. It's not a single one, so we're very lucky. But we have also been in various activities in other schools where things don't go that well. - It's so important from all the way from the school nurse and the principal, through the teachers, even the aides, the janitors, the school buses; they all need to know about food allergies and what to do if they see a child who's having allergic symptoms. - When we were selecting a school that was one of our criteria was finding a school that was understanding of the allergy, that had good programs in place to handle it. The school that she's at right now, all of the teachers and staff are trained on how to handle allergies. It is not a peanut-free school, however they take food allergies very seriously so outside of each classroom if there is an allergy they've got a big sign stating that this is a nut-free classroom, a peanut-free classroom. So she has her medication right there in the classroom, the teachers will handle it. We have a special snack box there. They also have a refrigerator-freezer in the classroom and so they've said we could bring in frozen cookies or cupcakes to defrost on days that other kids are bringing in birthday treats. They've gone out of their way to make sure that she's included in everything and that she doesn't feel different in any way. - [Isabelle] And I remember being so concerned that she was going to be different, and we're going to have to be different things, and she won't be able to have the same snack as the others when they're having a sweet. We have their own snacks, they don't eat the same snacks as everybody else. And not just at lunch, everything is different. And the teacher said, "But you know, "isn't it nice that she can learn so young "that she can be different than everybody else "and it's fine?" (laughs) You know? Maybe she won't be such a follower later, you know? Because she knows from the start that (laughs) it's okay to be different. - [Roger] The other thing was that she almost recognizes it as almost like, I'm special, I get to have this special thing, which she likes. So for Zoe it worked very well. - We have a donut table in our classroom. It's where our teacher sits, too. - But you know, I know she's responsible, I know she's careful. - [Audra] It's been rather frustrating because trying to explain to people, especially at school, their teachers, they don't understand that they really can't even be around other kids that have nuts or peanuts or anything that they're allergic to because there is a possibility that they might swap food. They're little kids, you know? They might grab something off of someone else's lunch and pop it in their mouth, and you'd have a really bad situation to deal with. So it's constantly reminding them. - In his school field trips, he's actually been left out of a few field trips where he's had to just go to another classroom during the day. For instance, the school went to a bakery and it was just not a safe place for him to be because of the milk and the eggs and the nuts that they had there. The kids were gonna be kneading the bread and that type of thing, and it just was not safe for him to go, and that was a bit disappointing for him. - So there was a lot of education to do and teachers are usually more receptive. (laughs) Some parents are very receptive but some parents were not. When I realized that Mia was allergic to wheat and that there were crackers all over the room in the daycare where she was, she said "If you're so concerned, keep your children at home "because I'm not gonna have my child "not be able to eat crackers "just because your child is allergic." - In his classroom it's a peanut-free and tree nut-free classroom. I think sometimes parents feel it's unfair for the school to dictate to them what they have to pack for snack or for lunch. I do sense that frustration from them sometimes. - People were concerned that this was infringing on the liberties of their own children, you know? But really, if your child could die (laughs) maybe they would just have a different attitude, you know? - It becomes so vitally important that schools and teachers and other adults and families support those families at those times, to show that their child can do anything that they want. (gentle piano music) - The teenagers, well they're a big problem for people with food allergy. We've actually done studies on this because fatality registries, so people who die unfortunately from a food allergy, they tend to be teenagers and young adults. So the risk factor there is age in addition to them having a food allergy and often underlying asthma, and often not using their medications like injectable epinephrine when they need to. So there you have the issue. - Of course I try not to do it too much, but if I look ahead into his life, if he still has these food allergies when he's older, I worry about what that's gonna be like for him when he's dating, and finding a wife that would be willing to cook for him a special way, that type of thing. I worry about college and sending him off on his own. So we can just hope that he's able to outgrow them or learn how to manage them well on his own. - I can see as she gets older, towards the preteen and teenage years, I can see how it might be a little more complicated because at that age nobody wants to be different. Even though there might be two other kids in her class who have allergies, it's still gonna single her out as being different. So I can see getting older it might be an issue but we're trying to instill as much confidence in her, and build up her self esteem so that she can be comfortable with who she is, she can accept the fact that this is who I am. I am allergic to this, but it's okay. There's a lot of other things I can do, a lot of other things I can eat. So we're hoping by talking about it now and helping her be comfortable with it and educating her about it, that that will hopefully help prevent problems later on. - The teenager who, from our studies, says, "I don't always carry my medications with me "because I think I might not need it, "so I'm not gonna carry it then;" or may have a reaction and say, "Well, maybe this will go away "and I don't need my medication," but really they do. They might eat more dangerously because they don't want to stand out as different from their friends. So that embarrassment or concern of being different also prevents them from treating themselves correctly. And teenagers are risk takers in general. So here we have an age group that really needs extra education. Teenagers are also venturing out more on their own. So we're talking about someone who might be going to parties, situations where there might be other problems around like alcohol that might impair their judgment. Issues with dating, for example, that they may have passionate kissing with someone who maybe ate what they're allergic to and that exchange of saliva can pose a problem if the partner ate something that they're allergic to. We found out that teenagers say that they may not carry their medication if it's inconvenient, so for example a stylish purse or tight jeans that don't fit self-injectable epinephrine, that was when they admitted that they might not carry it with them. So there are a lot of barriers that we need to overcome and educate for when it comes to teenagers. (gentle music) - So just speaking with other people and knowing that they get you, that they understand, because they're experiencing the same thing that you're experiencing is very comforting. Just knowing that there's a support group out there is great for us. - Knowing other people who are going through it, there's a lot of synergy. So if anyone has a reluctance to talk to a school about what they think should be in place to help keep their child safe, seeing another family do it, I mean it sort of inspires you to do it as well and I think that's probably the best thing that comes out of these support groups is that you inspire each other to take on these challenges. It helps us a lot every night. I see other families and certain things that they do and I think, "Well gosh, that makes a lot of sense to do, "I should be doing this with our school," and vice-versa, so that would be the best thing that comes out of it. - As physicians oftentimes we're limited what we can do in the office. We're trying to get the story, diagnose, do the testing, and deliver at least the key medical information that the parents or the child need to know about. Part of the reason that I like to see patients back regularly is so that we can hit some more of these finer points. I always try to pass out information with regard to The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network. It's a great online resource to look at to explain more about food allergies. - FAAN was originally founded back in 1991 because we have a daughter with food allergy and what we discovered was that it was a very difficult process to manage well. We had done it for a number of years and decided that it was time to share what we had learned with others who were affected by this condition. - From our office here, we provide the resources but we can't be out there to hold everybody's hand. We can't be out there to educate in every community situation. So the support groups are doing that important work. Families, when they're dealing with food allergies, oftentimes feel very isolated. They feel confused, they need help from someone who's been there. And the support groups are there for them. They are there on a local level, so they can get together people who have common interests and are dealing with common problems. They can work together on things that are going on in their community such as educating a school, or planning an activity to raise awareness about food allergies. So they do an important job, and they're out there at the grassroots level, if you will. They're out there with the individuals who need the support. FAAN appreciates the work that they do and we want to help them to do that. So we are trying to form a network of those groups that are out there doing that important work. We're trying to bring them together so that they can talk to each other and they can learn from each other what's been successful for you, what did you do in your area? And they can work off of that and help each other. - I had asked on this online chat board about food allergies, did anyone know of a support group in my area, and she didn't either but she said maybe we should do something. So we did get together and we decided to start a support group. We went online and found some different information from other types of organizations about how do you start a support group. So we came of with a name, the Circle of Food Allergic Families, our acronym is COFAF. Basically we put a note up on the internet and scheduled a meeting for a park, and we actually had eight people show up the first day which was really interesting and very comforting to know that there were other people in the area that were actually going through the same thing that we were going through. Before I knew it we had 20 people at the next meeting. It's now been up and running for about three years now, and we have over 200 families from all over the metropolitan Detroit area that come to our meetings. It is very helpful to have other people. The benefit's far-reaching from just the emotional support that you would have. People find new products all the time and share that with them, we share recipes with each other. If you're in need of finding a new doctor for whatever reason, that might be helpful as well. So I would strongly encourage them to reach out to other people in their community that have it, and if there isn't a support group to maybe start one. - And my mom took me on a food allergy walk that was special to raise money for a cure. - [Terry] Last year we did about 19 walks around the country. This year we're hoping to do more than 25. So it's a way in which the families can participate in raising funds for research and awareness and education about food allergy, and sort of to come together as a family with other families that are affected by food allergy, and have their kids feel like they belong to a community. So there's a real sense of community. The families work together to raise awareness in their local communities, on a broader basis. It's a feel-good opportunity for the entire family. Everyone that we've had, the story is the same. The people love coming there, the kids have a great time and we raise funds in the process. (gentle piano music) - Families and grandparents will say, "Well this has never happened before in our family, "we don't understand why it's happening now." One of the things to think about is it probably did happen, it's just people were unable to recognize things. I sit in front of you as one of the perfect examples. After my daughter was diagnosed with a peanut allergy and my sister's daughter was diagnosed with an egg allergy, my mother, after all this 30-some years finally came up and said, "You and your sister were "the most food-allergic children we had ever known. "You always threw up when you ate milk and egg, "you could never eat milk and egg "until you were six or seven. "And even to this day you still won't eat milk and egg." It was never recognized. It probably was the same type of reaction we're seeing in my own children now. What our parents and our grandparents noticed was probably happening, it just went unrecognized. So one of the dilemmas we're trying to figure out is the prevalence and increase in allergies, especially food allergies, is this due to the fact that these things are happening more often or as doctors and scientists are we getting better at recognizing these problems? And it probably is a combination of both. The medical science definitely suggests that food allergies and all allergic disease, hay fever, asthma, allergies, are all increasing just as much as food allergies in the past few years. - So it's a huge mystery as to why are we seeing this apparent increase in food allergies and other allergic problems for that matter? The only way to really know if the allergy's increasing is to do the same exact study at two points in time, and actually we did that. We did a survey study in the U.S. population where we were focusing on peanut allergy and tree nut allergy. We did that study in 1997 and repeated it with the same methods in 2003, and what we found was that for peanut allergy there were twice as many reports of peanut allergy in young children between those two periods in time. In the UK a similar study was done on birth cohorts, also separated by about five or six years, and they found the same thing. They actually found a tripling in positive allergy tests to peanut, and a doubling in reported peanut allergy. So at least from those studies it seems pretty clear that there really is an actual increase. There have been studies also looking at allergy tests just in the general population, and those also have increased over time in the U.S. So I don't think it's just more diagnosis or just more reports in the news, I think there really is an increase. (gentle piano music) Well what does the future hold in terms of treatment for someone with a food allergy? There's basically great news which is that there's more in the pipeline now than ever. It's actually quite amazing how in the last several years there are a number of clinical studies, meaning people getting treatments to try to reverse, cure, or at least make life safer for someone with a food allergy. The types of treatments basically fall into two categories. One is a food-specific treatment, like I'm going to treat your milk allergy or egg allergy or peanut allergy; or a treatment that would make food allergies better and it doesn't matter what the food was. So examples of some of the studies that are looking at maybe just treating whatever you're allergic to, at the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute here in New York, doctors including Xiu-Min Li who is a Chinese physician who studied herbal remedies in China has concocted a food allergy herbal formula that at least so far in mice has shown very good treatment for food allergy. We're hoping that it's safe and effective in people and we're starting to look at that now. There's also a medication called anti-IgE. IgE is that protein that causes allergies. This particular injected medication lowers the IgE in the body and there have been a few studies getting a feel that this might make life safer, although you wouldn't be able to eat the food you're allergic to but while you're avoiding it, if you had an accident, maybe it would make it better. So there's more studies going on with that. In terms of studies looking at specific foods and trying to treat, for example, a peanut allergy or a milk allergy, there are already allergy therapies. For example if you have an insect sting allergy you might have allergy shots for your bee stings. These have been tried for foods, like a shot for peanut, but there have been a lot of side effects. So people are looking at different strategies. So what are the strategies for people who might have an allergy and you're trying to treat that specific allergy? A vaccine-type of therapy is one route. Instead of giving a shot of peanut that might cause a reaction itself, people are looking at changing the protein so that it doesn't trigger an allergic reaction but still makes you get used to peanut. So giving that as some type of a vaccine therapy, either a shot or a medication given in another route like by mouth for example, to try to teach the body to gradually learn to accept peanut or some other food and not attack it, so that's a specific food therapy we call immunotherapy. Another treatment that's been looked at is trying to actually feed the person the food that they're allergic to in tiny amounts to get their body used to it, either by having them swallow it or put it under their tongue for a while. These therapies, this is not to try at home, are being looked at as well. Potentially again, they could cause some side effects because you're trying to give something that a person's allergic to. But under a doctor's supervision in very controlled trials we're starting to look at that as well. - As a society I think what we're looking for is some solution and answer that ties everything up in a neat bow, so that we can understand a particular process that happens. But human beings are complex. What makes us up as individual human beings and what influences lots of us is very complex combinations of genetics, environmental exposure, timing of exposures, society issues, and foods that we choose to eat. For example, why is a certain food allergy worse in Japan than it is here? It's a combination of the genetics, how people eat there compared to what we eat here. - The thing with research is though, it takes time. And for people who have the allergy they want a cure today, they want a cure six months from now and it takes longer than that for research. But when we look down the horizon it is so promising, and we're so very much certain that there will be therapies, there will be treatments, hopefully there will be a cure. There's a lot of very promising things that are showing us that yes, we are moving in that direction, we're just not moving quite as fast as people with the allergy would like for it to happen. (cheerful piano music) - [Harvey] So children are the most wonderful examples of how we probably should live our lives. The child's innocence usually is a great indicator of really how we should all perceive a potential food allergy. Most children aren't bothered by their food allergy. They live their life the way that they want to and are very happy living the way they want to. - It is much more of a deal for you than it is for your child. You're the one that's dealing with the frustrations over it and it's probably more so because I myself don't have food allergies, so to some extent internally I think, "Oh, isn't it so sad that he can't have ice cream." Well he can, he just has to have soy ice cream. He just has to have something different, and you don't want your child to be different. Unfortunately that's just the nature of this, they have to be in order to stay safe. - They do treat me differently and I feel that you have to treat me differently because if you treat me like a normal kid then they're gonna give me normal food, and that normal food could have nuts in it. So I have to be treated differently in some ways but I don't want to be treated like oh, that's the kid that has food allergies. - You want your children to live, I mean they're normal (laughs) they just have food allergies. You want them to be able to live a normal life, you know? - They don't think of themselves as any different than other kids, other than the fact that they can't have certain foods. - [Harvey] One of the most common misperceptions about food allergies is that this is a life-changing even to the negative. People can live a normal life, they can have a wonderful life, while having the burden of food allergies in their life. It does not end that child's potential of where they can be, or an individual's. There are plenty of people who can tolerate their food allergies and live very happily. It's nothing more than a speed bump. - It has some significant consequences if they don't manage it well. But it's a way of keeping a very close family unit. They all work together for the same ends, and in the final analysis there's a lot of happy food-allergic kids out there who grow up and either they outgrow their food allergy or they grow into very happy food-allergic adults. - So for every extra 10 minutes we have to spend to figure out is somebody gonna take care of her or whatever, the hidden surprise that because we spend so much time together we get to be probably closer than maybe a family would when people are going 90 different directions. - My bottom line is that a family with a child with food allergy, an adult with food allergy, should be able to do just about everything that the other people are doing except eat the food that you're allergic to. That takes advance planning, it takes education, it takes reading resources to really get to know what to do so that it doesn't ruin your quality of life. - What was a typical normal childhood for myself and for my husband, we're just making our own changes here and making it a unique experience for our children. We're not looking at it as we're taking something away from them, we're adding to it and we're creating new fun things and trying new things with them. It's just, it's different. - At the end of the day when people ask about how difficult it is to live with food allergies, I would assume I sit in front of everybody here and my families I take care of, and I can tell them honestly I was one of those kids and it didn't stop me from doing what I wanted to do. Unfortunately it's happened in my family again with my own child, but I hope my daughter has the same experiences I do, lives life the best she can, do what she wants to do, and that it's frustrating at times as a parent. It makes me sad sometimes that I have to see this. It makes me sad when I'm with my families taking care of them. But I'm here, I'm happy, I think I've done pretty well. My job is to help other families understand that and take care of them with their children and families and show that this food allergy issue is not as concerning as it should be if the right tools are in place.
