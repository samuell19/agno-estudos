With the passage of the Freedom of Observation act, a new and mighty weapon in the war on terror was placed in our hands. The first major step mandated under the new law was to unite the vast array of separate public and private surveillance cameras throughout our nation into a single network-- the Optical Defense Intelligence Network, --named ODIN. ODIN monitors every form of domestic electronic communication for criminal activity. The most visible and highly successful addition to our eye line has been the introduction of a powerful new set of state-of-the-art mobile robotic surveillance cameras known as Eyeborgs. Lord, give me eyes that I might see. That's better. What is he up to? Terrorist bastard. Yeah, I'm looking at you. Excellent. Cool. Look, I got something. Something big. Only--I don't know what it is. Show me. What is this, now? Show me what they've got. Clear left and zoom. It's something new they're developing. It's something we've never seen before. We did it. Come on. We lost the signal. Should we move in? Negative. Hold positions. We got company. Shells? Yeah. Now, I wonder how it got in here. What? Wait a minute. Hey, you don't think that I brought--? I think-- you just got careless. Damn it. Move in, move in. Go, go, go. Go around back. Here we go. Key on us. Find him. All right, little friend. Show me what happened here. You were so hot on stage tonight. I just love your band. What's it called again? Painful Daze. Right, Painful Daze. Brandon, you're an awesome singer, and out of all those girls, you picked me. Well, you seem... Special. So, you got the stuff? Oh, God, oh, God. Relax, it's a friend. G-Man. Who's she? She's cool. So you got the stuff? You know what you got to do. I--I know. I'll break it good. Enjoy your stuff. What was that? Just forget about it, okay? Is that what I think it is? As promised. Genuine homegrown... North Carolina tobacco. Oh, my God. I haven't had a cigarette since the government made smoking illegal. God, you taste like an ash tray. You too. That is so hot. What was that? Shh. Okay, Marsha. All right. If Brandon calls you or anything, just let me know, and I'll do the same, all right? Okay, thanks. Nothing. He disappeared with that chick after the show last night. Nobody knows where he is. Painful Daze, you're up. Okay. Well, Jarett, I hope you know the lyrics, because you just became lead singer of the band. What lyrics? Nobody knows the lyrics. It's just a bunch of incoherent screaming. Thank you, guys, so very much. You guys have been awesome. Get ready to go balls to the walls with Painful Daze. Sideshow 321 Alpha through 411 Charlie. No subs, all sections. Don't worry, man. Hey, we'll find him. We'll find him. I just wish we knew his target. Hi. Um, hey. We're Painful Daze, like it says on the drum. Okay, let's, um--rock. Subject vehicle, ID positive. LB 5059 reporting. Section C-47. Full up. He must be inside. Pin down C-47. Get me some eyes inside that club. Negative. Not without a warrant! Bureaucracy. Search warrant approved. Send them in. That's Sankur. That's our man. Let's let the Eyeborgs flush him out. Attention, everyone. A Department of Homeland Security emergency defense operation is in progress. Everyone please remain calm and follow all instructions as given. Once again, a Department of Homeland Security emergency defense operation is in progress. Everyone please remain calm and follow all instructions as given. Whoa! Everyone please remain where you are. DHS, put the gun on the ground! Back off. Back off. Step away from the girl, Sankur. Don't make this harder than it is. On the ground, now. Now. You can't stop me. Away. Move, move, move. Stay away! Stay where you are! I mean it. Take him down. I'm doing this for you. Put your guns down. This is for everyone. Jim, suppression fire only. We need him alive, Jim. We need him alive. Suppression fire only. Suppression fire only. Suppression fire only. Go, go! Ah. Go, go, go. Move out! Suppression fire only. Suppression fire only! Stay down. We've got to stop them. What was that? What? What are you doing? We needed him alive. Well, you got your target. It's this punk kid over here. Wake up, America! The president is lying. Are you hurt? No, I don't think so. Where is the truth? They're watching us. They're watching us all. They're watching us all! You're a lucky son of a bitch. That little Eyeborg just saved your life. Oh, God. I've got a gig. You're lucky to be alive. Any idea why this guy would be taking a shot at you? No, I don't know. What's your name? Uh, Jarett. I'm with Painful Daze. Jarett. Last name, Jarett? Hewes. H-U-G-- No. H-E-W-E-S. You mean like-- Yeah. Next you're gonna tell me you're related. He's my uncle. You seriously want me to believe that the president of the United States is your uncle? Hey, he's serious. You do have a gig, playing for the president of the United States next week. Yeah. Well, he's a good man. He'll get my vote again. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, me too. Hey, listen, you think we could just not tell anybody about this? I got enough nut jobs coming after me as it is. Yeah. Our job is keeping you safe. Keep the family relations quiet. Okay, thank you. Yeah, well, we know where to find you. Ronni? You don't suppose him being the president's nephew has anything to do with this? Gunner. Donut run. Gunner, Gunner. Agent Reynolds. Yeah. Ms. Hoppy, isn't it? Barbara Hawkins. What happened here this evening? Nothing. It's all over. We heard reports of gunshots from this establishment. Yeah, there were gunshots. And why was that? Because guns were being fired. Was there a reason, or are you and your men just the sort to enjoy shooting off their loads while people watch? Not if you're filming it. Good night, Ms. Harpy. Hawkins. Just in the nick of too late. You know, they have machines that'll do your job now, minus the lip. We're off. To make the news. You just got careless. I didn't do it. Are you saying I can't trust what I see with my own eyes? You're not seeing it with your own eyes. You're seeing it with their eyes. All right. Let's talk about last night. The kid. You were trying to kill him. Why? The kid is a stepping stone. To the president? He's not the president. He was never elected into office. Funny, I thought we had an election. Not an election, a coup! Computerized voting. No paper trail. The exit polls showed him trailing the whole day, and then some computer announces he's our new president? Oh, this guy looks like the love child of Charles Manson and Karl Marx. Ew. He doesn't look like a Marx brother. Oh, cute. Their guy wins, it's democracy. Our guy wins, it's a coup. Actually, I voted for the other guy. Really? Uh-huh. Me, too. Oh. You want some coffee? And the only way we can take America back is to kill Benjamin Hewes. President won't be in town for another two weeks. And you knew you didn't have two weeks, so you went after the kid. You're just putting nails in freedom's coffin. My job is to protect freedom and the people of this nation from those that would do them harm. In that case, we're on the same side. What say we go after that son of a bitch Hewes together? You realize you're facing federal charges. Under the Freedom of Observation Act, it is a government offense to tamper with, disable, or otherwise interfere with the operation of an official observation device, which basically means you're screwed, 'cause you're going to pay for that Eyeborg you shot. Now, take some time and come up with some names by the time I get back. How about Kyle? And Sharon? Damn shame what happened to your family. I am sorry about that. I'm sure you are. But if it wasn't for what happened to them, we wouldn't have Eyeborgs to scrape out scum like you. Don't let that freak get to you. He's not. Go figure. Well, ain't you a cute little thing. Oh, there he is. Agent Reynolds. Ms. Hawkins, what are you doing here? I'm trying to get a straight answer about what happened last night. I have no comment. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Wait. Decaf. There was a shooting last night at a public facility. Turn that camera off. No, don't turn the camera off. You have no right to film in this building. I do, I am in the lobby. Turn that camera off or I'll shoot you. - He can't shoot you. - I will shoot you. He is allowed to be in the lobby. Everybody wants to be a comedian. What's that all about? Hey, drink up. First they ban cigarettes. This will be next. Huh? Obviously, you're hiding something. - I'm not hiding anything. - No! Turn that back on! Hey, hey. Oh, God. No, no, no, no. Uh-uh. Security breach. All sections initiate lock-down procedures immediately. Initiate lockdown procedures immediately. Just stay here! This is not a drill. Oh! Ashley, talk to me. The subject is headed toward the south hall. Damn. Toward the west lobby. East stairwell, now. East stairwell. Yeah, he's in the west lobby. There he is. Up there. Now in the north stairwell. Come on, go, go, go. Got you. Ah! I need you to override the emergency lock-down on level six. Overriding the lock-down on level six. Come on. Come on. Agent Warner, are you in yet? Hang on. Let's go. Override lock-down, level seven. Abort lock-down. Come on. No! No! DHS agents are uncertain how a suspect who was in the process of being interrogated managed to escape from the room and commit suicide, but an investigation is under way. Jack. Horrible turn of events, Barbara. Absolutely horrible. Thank you, Barbara. In other news, President Benjamin Hewes... My uncle's politics take a turn to fucking derangement land, and people want to take it out on me. I mean, I haven't even seen him since I was a little kid. I don't even know him anymore, you know? I wouldn't vote for the son of a bitch, and we're related. Jarett, at least you're still alive. I mean, God knows I never thought I'd say this. As much as those Eyeborg things creep me out, you would be dead if it weren't for them. Tsk. Mm. Look, I am sure the guitar man can fix her up. Yeah, well, if G-Man can't, no one can. I could use a little fixing, too. Hm! Yeah? Oh, look. It's your uncle. As president, there is nothing more important than protecting the people. Great. Now he's cutting into my sex life, too. That is why I supported the Freedom of Observation Act. Now, with my new law, every camera in the nation, as well as millions of mobile units, have been linked directly into ODIN. Man, millions of mobile units. ...a network that never sleeps, never rests, and never stops looking out for you. Yesterday, the State Department issued yet another terror alert, this time citing the nation of Zimbekistan. What? Zimbekistan? Are they your next target, Mr. President? How many more nations will we invade before you're satisfied we're safe? The final debate will be held next week, with our own Winston Salem playing host to the president's contingent. Jamie Kell reports. Jill, I'm standing outside the Millennium Center, from which the president's side of the debate will be broadcast. I'm gonna be there. I cannot believe you convinced me to play this fundraiser. Oh, stop whining. He is desperate for the younger vote, and you need the gig. Just take advantage of it and invite some fans along. Yeah, right. He won't even let me bring the band. He only speaks in front of invited, supporting crowds, for security reasons. As with previous debates, the candidates are in different locations to create a less centralized target for terrorists. What are you doing? Do you remember that wedding gig you did last month? The two ladies who got married. No, the other one. Oh, the foreign guy? There has definitely been a bank error. Come and check it out. Only individuals especially invited by the president are permitted inside the debate hall. Obviously he liked us. Obviously a computer hair-balled up a decimal point in the wrong place. I mean, I'll have the bank fix it, but do you remember that terror alert on the news, about Zimbekistan? Yeah? Well, that's where all this money came from. What? Yeah. Oh, shit! Ronni, the last thing I need is for the government to think that I'm in some kind of business with terrorists. I mean, if Uncle B's opponents get ahold of that, this could be really serious. I know, I know, I will have it fixed by tomorrow. Look, who never fails you? My Ronni. That's right. Don't ever forget it. I'm glad you failed once. Yeah, me too. Or I'd have never met you. You know the most romantic thing you ever said to me? Um, put on this collar and bark like a dog? No, but that was dope. The first time we talked-- Mm-hm? Jarett, just shut up and fuck me already. Uh, yeah, that was it. No, no, play it again. That's not what happened. I locked that door. I keyed in the codes. I got the red light. Not according to ODIN. Database confirms what the cameras show. You keyed the unlock code twice. Then the database is wrong. Are you postal? There's nothing wrong with the database. You keyed the wrong codes. Video shows it, and computer records confirm it. It's wrong. I locked that door. What are you saying? I can't trust what I can see with my own eyes? Jim, you were there. What happened? I'm sorry, I didn't see it. What do you mean, you didn't see? You were standing next to me. You were upset. You've keyed those codes a thousand times. This time, you made a mistake. And that's how I'm writing it up, all right? E.O.F. Play it again. George! George, you can't do an end of file on this one. Because? Because Sankur was trying to kill the president. What if he wasn't working alone? No one was working with Sankur. How do we know that? Because the head office said so. They've had this fruit basket flagged and monitored ever since he checked out The Anarchist's Cookbook from the local library. He was a lone nut. Now he's a dead nut. Well, at least let Bradley and I check out his apartment. Jesus, Gunner! We might find-- Don't you get it? You've got good friends in high places, probably because your testimony helped get the Eyeborg system on-line. Aw, come on! Don't pull that on me, George! But push this too far-- and someone may press charges for negligence. Don't let one mistake ruin a great career. I'm not ordering you as a supervisor. I'm telling you as a friend. Let it go! What kind of a tenant was Sankur? He was very, very quiet, and he was very strange. They always are. Oh, am I gonna be on television? Maybe. Oh. Oh. These doors kind of stick. Oh, there we go. Thank you. We won't be long. Oh, take your time. You know, I'm a fan of yours. Oh, thank you. Bye. Thank you. Bye bye. Whoa. Suddenly the clutter in my apartment doesn't seem that bad. Gunner said they were done here, but it doesn't look like anybody's been in here! There's got to be something really good here. Ho, ho, ho. Here's something good. Mr. Deller's, it's been such a long time. How are you doing? Eric, don't even look at this. I've got it under control. It's like running into your ex-wife. Glad to be rid of her, but there were some good times. Come on, Eric, give it-- You take this and I'll take this. Pry it loose. Pry it loose. Pry it loose. Okay. Oh! Look at this, look at this, look at this. What? What? This is the kid, the punk rocker that Sankur attacked the other night. He's related to the president. He's related to the president. That's what Gunner was hiding! Yeah, probably worried you'd report it. And risk losing my reporter's license? I don't think so. Do you think he's hiding something else? Yeah, he did seem a little tense. A little tense? He threatened to shoot me. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Sankur claimed this DHS footage wasn't real. Is it possible that this is fake? Sure. I mean, computers these days-- Anybody can make a computer composite. But to make it realistic-looking and rendered in real time? Now you're talking some serious processing power. Would you check it out for me, please? Worth a bottle of Deller's? No, it's not. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Of course I'll do it for you, Barbara. Come on! We're off! Off to make the news, baby. Hello, G-Man? G-Man? You're supposed to stay open till 5:00. Where are you? G-Man? El hombre de guitar. Wind blows open my door, and who floats in on the breeze? None other than the nephew of the almighty himself. Come on, G, not again. Still a little touchy about being related to the bastard-in-chief, huh? You really wanna talk politics to a guy with purple hair? Seriously? How's it hanging, J? It's good. You? Eh, long and limp, but at least I can walk on it. Now what graces you to my doorstep? Check it out. Let me guess-- Brandon bouncing around on stage again? Uh, no. Brandon's, like, missing. What? He disappeared with some chick after the High Point show. Well, if not him, then who? A freaking Lie-borg did this? Hey, it saved my life, man. Really, I'm serious. I know you don't like them. Don't like them? That's an understatement. Look, I can count seven or eight of them damn things, right from here, and every one of them photon-sucking spy-bots-- Wired directly to your uncle's office. Yeah, I'm actually pretty sure the ODIN mainframe is not sitting in the Oval Office. Might as well be. We, the people, sure don't run this country anymore. Looks like my uncle wants me to play this fundraiser next week. Never figured the C-in-C for a headbanger. Think you can get her done? Patience, kid, patience. I love the extremeness of your life, man. As long as those Eyeborgs are around. Dude, they're just cameras. An EB saved your life, didn't it? Yes. By taking a pretty picture of you? No. By getting between me and a bullet. Wow. Pretty smart move for a camera, don't you think? Ah. Here. Read this. "The Freedom of Observation Act?" Are you kidding me? Did you actually read all this? More than the stupid senators and congressmen that passed it. Check out page 742. "In the absence of any formal law enforcement authority, "a unit may act as needed to obstruct a perpetrator in the commission of a crime. " So yeah, if a terrorist is about to blow up a building, and there's no cops around to stop it, then an Eyeborg can stop it. Exactly. What is wrong with that? What's wrong with it? Yeah. It's not limited to just terrorists blowing up buildings. What if an Eyeborg catches you doing something wrong, and no one's around to stop it? It can do whatever it wants. They're just security cameras. What if it's not just a camera? What if somebody puts a weapon in it? Think about it. Robot soldiers infiltrating society, seeking out enemies of the government. This is America. Things like that can't just happen. Man, you really had me going there with all that conspiracy crap. It's not crap. I was there when they first used robot soldiers to kill people in GW2. I'm telling you-- Eyeborgs keep us safe. "Those who choose safety over freedom deserve neither." Benny Franklin, 1776. Those who would play for the president need a working guitar. Jarett, 5:27. I'll get her all pretty for you. Don't worry. All right. Hey, thanks, bro. See you. Oh, God, look out. My God, he's got a gun. Ha. What do you know? Mm. Eric, hey, what's up? I did what you asked. I went over Sankur's homicide video, and guess what I found? What? Pixel blending. What does that mean? If you create a 3-D object in a computer, you can render it with 2-D, but if the angle's too steep, you get artifacts. The only way to get something like that perfect is to have a 3-D scan of the person. Without that, there's always some flaw to give it away. In Sankur's clothing, there's an area where it looks like-- You guessed it-- Pixel blending. So does that mean the video could be fake? That's what I just said. Oh, I knew something was up. Beam it over to me right now. Um, this system's not networked. What, are you in the Stone Age? It keeps from getting viruses, all right? Hold on. Okay. Look, I got the chip in hand. I'll come over and show you what I'm talking about. That's even better. I'm gonna be home in ten minutes. Go right now. Go. What is this? Barbara, I was just kidding. Jeez, you want to get me fired? Get off of me! Let me go! Let go of me. What are you doing? What are you doing? Ahh! Ahhh! Yeah, whoo! Now that's how you make the news, baby. Thank you. You have been "dis-armed", baby. Damn. Hell's a'popping. See what you can find out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. We DLed Eric leaving the station. And these are from the traffic camera. Eyewitness said he nearly killed her when he ran a red light. He was all over the road, completely out of control. Were you aware that Eric had a history of alcohol abuse? Yes, but he was always so definite that his drinking was in the past. Why did you call us? This was a traffic accident. What made you think it was a DHS matter? This is going to sound a little crazy now, but I had Eric analyze the Sankur homicide video. Why? Sankur said the video wasn't real, and Eric's a video expert, so I had him analyze it. He said it looked fake. He was coming to show me. Report from the forensic guy. Sounds a lot less plausible coming from a drunk. But he didn't sound drunk. Computer analysis. Shows he had almost a full bottle today. I'm sorry. But he didn't sound drunk. Coffee? So how'd you find me here? My little friend showed me. Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting you are the father of the Eyeborgs. That's not my favorite title. It's just that everybody knows that if it weren't for you, the ODIN system would never have gone beyond the testing stage. That's because I testified in front of the senate committee, and you reported how I felt. Look, Gunner, I had a story to do, and it was about how you felt. You weren't just another law enforcement officer bucking for a tool. Your story-- What happened to your family-- That is what moved people. I just wanted to catch the bastard that killed my wife and took my son. I know. And you got the Eyeborgs instead. Yeah, and a very nice note from the vice president, thanking me for my support on his pet project. Look, how close were you with Eric? He was like a little brother. He was a pest sometimes, but I don't know what I'm going to do without him. If he was drinking again, do you think he would have hidden it from you? Like you hiding that the kid who was attacked the other night was the president's nephew? You are on a need to know basis. I couldn't have his identity compromised by putting his name on the air. Do you know what this is? A journalist's license. When the government started requiring that journalists be licensed, most of my colleagues quit, but I stayed. Do you know why? Because my husband was killed in the last attacks, and I swore I'd do whatever I could to prevent anyone from having to feel that kind of pain. Other reporters called me a traitor, but I believe in what I did, so don't treat me like I can't be trusted. Are you certain that Eric was right about the video? Absolutely. I am positive. Because if you report what I'm about to tell you, we could both be brought up on Patriot Act charges. Well then, I guess it's all about trust, then, isn't it? I must be losing my mind. Fine. There are things-- Small things, but a lot of them. ... Vetoed pending legislation, prohibiting domestic deployment, saying with the ever-changing nature of the terrorist threat, it is vital to keep all options open. Earlier this afternoon, Vice President Rutledge introduced the latest in a developing line of military killer robot soldiers. Bastard. These robot soldiers, which are being deployed today, are designed to protect our men and women overseas and our children at home. Why did the president veto a bill designed to prohibit domestic deployment? Terrorism knows no borders. Now, the president and I are gonna be exploring every option available to make sure that we protect all the citizens of this country. Go. You got to stop the project. Is your line encrypted? It doesn't matter. They know. Where are you? Look, I don't think I have much time. You--you got to cancel the project. David, calm down. It's rigged and ready. Well, unrig it. Unrig it now! David? The president. The Eyeborgs. I know the truth. What truth? God help us all. They're here. No! Robot rats. Come on, try to get a piece of me, you silicon psychos! You little binary bastards. Little digital dingoes. Ahh! Ahh! Hey, G-Man. Hey, G, You in there, man? Hey, G, it's Jarett. Hey, hey, hey. Help, help, help. Help. Hey, hey, hey. Help, help. Help. Help. Help. Hey. Whoa. G-Man! G-Man! Oh, God. G-Man. I need an ambulance. I'm in Liberty and Trade Street behind Midtown Guitar. Don't tell me to calm down! Want to go over the part again about what you saw in the alley? I saw an Eyeborg rushing out, and it attacked me. Eyeborgs aren't allowed on private property without a warrant. I know that. There's no warrant issued for this property, so there's no way there was an Eyeborg inside. Video surveillance in the alley. No, no, that's not right. No, it wasn't a man. It was an Eyeborg. It was one of those, it was one of the big spidery ones. Yeah, but I see a man. But you're not seeing through your eyes. You're seeing with their eyes. I saw what I saw. What are you doing? Are you going nuts? I'd like to know if my partner's going nuts before you get us both killed. I don't know, Jim. Just cut me some slack. I'm working on something. Is that the guitar G-Man repaired? Yeah. G-Man was the best. Can I take her? Sure. It's not evidence. Try to stay out of trouble. I just want to go home and be with my girl. Guilty conscience there, partner? Is this a joke? Come on. Come on, son. I'll buy you some ice cream. My momma warned me about guys like you. Thank you, Iris. Ahhh. Isn't this fabulous? Sure you don't want some? It's freedom vanilla. What's the deal, man? Am I under arrest here? I mean, every time something bad happens-- I thought this would be a safe place to talk. And now G-man is dead. I thought this would relax you a little bit, because you seem to be very tense most of the time. Now, of course, I'm eating freedom vanilla ice cream in an exotic car wash with a DHS officer. I believe you saw an Eyeborg the other night. Thank you. I can't be certain, but I think someone hacked into the ODIN system and is controlling them. Focus! What? Yeah, no, I know. I thought there were-- I think someone's trying to kill the president. Huh? Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. Someone-- Someone has compromised our surveillance system. Like who? Like terrorists. Ooh, terrorists. I'm so scared. The government made the Eyeborgs, they control the Eyeborgs, but if something goes wrong, it's never the government's fault. There's a traitor somewhere, somewhere probably high up in government office. Maybe even inside the DHS. What do you want me to do about it? I need you to contact the president. You have found the wrong guy for that. We're talking about his life here. I can't do that. Why not? You're the only one that can go directly to him. - They won't believe me. - Why not? They won't believe me. Look, there is an entire branch of government that's set up to protect him. You don't need me. Listen, son. Whether you want to be involved in this or not, you are. Now, you, the president, and anyone connected to you could be in serious danger. We don't know anyone in Zimbekistan. So what you're telling me is that this money came from the government of Zimbekistan, and not a private individual? Well, you or somebody higher up than you is gonna get this money back to Zimbekistan if we have to be here till Gulf War 7 breaks out. Capisce? All right, I expect to hear from you within the hour. Thank you. Get-- Get--get out. Get out. Shoo. Get out! You're not supposed to be in here. Fine. If you won't get out, I will. Call Jarett. Call-- Call Jarett. I'm sorry, command not understood. Call--Jarett! Hey, baby, you will never guess what-- Jarett, help. What? Ronni? Hello, hello? Can you see me? Jarett, help. Yeah, you're breaking up. I can't really see you. What's going on? Are you all right? Ronni? Ronni, I'm on my way. I'm on my way home right now, okay? Hang tight. Ronni? Shit. Jarett! Ronni? Ronni? Ronni? Hey, Ronni? Ronni? Ronni? Ronni? Ronni, are you in there? Ronni? No, no, no, Ronni. Ronni! Ronni! No! Please, Ronni. Ronni. Ronni. Ronni. They're calling it a suicide because she had a history, but I told them what I thought I saw on the phone-- An Eyeborg-- When she called me. And what did the police say when you said that? There was no record that she called. Did you speak to your uncle? No, I tried. I can't get ahold of him. He's coming here tomorrow. I need you to make that meeting. No, no. I can't. I can't. I can't do that. Jarett, I know this is really hard on you, but think about what happened to Ronni, what almost happened to you. Your uncle could be in extreme danger. Well, that's not my problem. That's not. No. That's not my fucking problem. You have no idea what you're asking me to do here, okay? I never, I never talk to my family. I mean, I am so far over on the other fucking side of this-- And there's no way-- I'm not. No. I'm-- Jarett Hewes? Yeah? Please hold for the president. It's him. Jerry? Uncle Benjamin. I heard about what happened, and I am so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help? No, thank you. Um, it's just... I--I need to tell you something. I need to talk to you about the Eyeborgs. Wait just a minute. Will you excuse us, please? Now, Jarett, listen very carefully to me. This is not a secure line, and I'm not in a position to talk right now. But it is very important that you not mention this to anyone else. Just promise me you'll be there tomorrow night, and we can sort this out face to face. I really don't know if I can be there. Jarett, please. At least let me see you after what's happened. Okay. Okay, I'll be there. I'll see you tomorrow, then. Okay, bye. He sounded concerned. It doesn't seem like you're on the other side, does it? Okay. Okay. I will play that fundraiser. It's what Ronni wanted me to do. But if I'm going to walk in there and try to convince the president that security cameras are killing people, I need some real proof. I'll get you the proof. You just be there. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Live from 44 HD election central, this is campaign coverage of Decision America, with Jack Romero, Jill Coppola, Barbara Hawkins, Jamie Kell, and the Eyewitness News Team. Good afternoon to you. I'm Jack Romero. And I'm Jill Coppola. Coming to you live from our state-of-the-art election central newsroom. Today, Eyewitness News' continuing coverage of Decision America, and the final presidential debate of this election. We begin our coverage with Barbara Hawkins at the debate site. Barbara? Thank you, Jill. The day of the debate has finally arrived in Winston-Salem at the beautiful Millennium Center. The president's limo arrived moments ago, and we've been informed that he was escorted inside, where a crowd of invited supporters awaits him behind closed doors. Oh. This is a great idea you had, checking out what's his face's shop. G-Man. I know what happened here. I saw the movie. Well, now you can read the book. Ha ha ha. That's funny. Take a look at that. What do you suppose made this? Look, I know what I saw in the video. Well, let's take a look inside. Although only supporters are allowed near the president for security reasons, there are, in fact, many protesters demonstrating against his policies here today. For safety, such dissenters are kept far away from the president in tightly regulated first amendment zones. Thank you, Barbara. You ever think about how easy the Eyeborgs make it to get convictions? If you mean having video of a crime as compelling evidence, then yeah. It's hard to argue with video. Exactly. No cross examination. Was there anything on the computers? Nothing. Our guys went over it from the last bit and pixel. Someone that doesn't trust machines wouldn't put anything in there. He'd be doing things the old-fashioned way. You heard it here-- The president says he understands and agrees that we are way in over our heads financially, yet he continues to perpetuate the problem by continuing to put more money into a system which is controlling us, and my goal is to cut that out. What are you doing? It's hollow. What? There is one word that the senator likes to use a lot with reference to ODIN, and that's control. There's a very big difference between observation and control. Here. That's it. Come here. ...the ODIN system. And from conception into development, into manufacturing, into implementation, many, many jobs have been created. Good afternoon, Mr. Hewes. Take that, please? I think to the tune of over six million jobs have been created, and ladies and gentlemen, every one of those jobs is within the United States. We have greatly increased the gross national product, and increased the tax base and the revenues of the federal government. It pays for itself, ladies and gentlemen. DHS to Secret Service, Headliner has entered the building. What's this? Look at these designs. Weapons on the Eyeborgs? They must be fake. She's not lax at all, and we both know that. We just disagree. We simply disagree. Hello? We all know how I feel about it, and I'm hoping one day, she'll reveal how she feels about it, and what she wants to do instead. I want to make one thing perfectly clear, and that is I agree with the president. I believe that we should be protected. I believe that we do need security. However, there is a very thin line between being protected and an invasion of privacy. God. What's this? Looks like C-4. It's more like a C-4 variant. It's odorless and malleable. This could get past the scanners without a problem. There's no scent. The sniffers would miss it. G-Man had to get it near the president. How? We are not watching the American people. These are cameras and mobile units. They are not human. They are observing and recording behavior. There are many levels, and the first level is behavior number one. Number one is simply normal human behavior. There's no threat. There's no red flag. When a mobile unit or a camera sees behavior that indicates possible criminal activity is in the works, it goes to level two. Still, no human eye is on the human being. I can't get a signal down here. Come on, we've got to warn them. Let's go. Jim, be careful. What? Maybe they can help us get a signal. Guys, we need for you to get us-- Jim. No. Jim? Jim? Damn. Come on, Ed. Gunner, what the hell happened to you? Jim Bradley's dead. How? The Eyeborgs have been compromised. How can the Eyeborgs be compromised? And that's not our only problem. Jarett Hewes, the president's nephew, has a bomb hidden in his guitar. The kid's already in the building. We'll secure the perimeter. You take a team in and get the president out of there. Yes, sir. Sanchez, get your team together. Let's not hurt the kid. He doesn't know he's been set up. What's going on? What happened? Terrorists have control of the Eyeborgs, and Jarett's guitar is rigged to assassinate the president. That's not funny. No, you're right. It's not. Round them up. Move them out. What's the situation? The debates are still going on but we can't contact anyone on the radio. Our first priority is to get the president out. Understood. Let's go, commander. Yup. Sanchez? DHS, Secret Service. Stand down. Where are the president's guards? I don't know. They should be here. We're taking the president off-stage, then we get him out of the building. Gunner, wait. Let's get a twenty on that kid first. Coyle, take a team. I want you to sweep the building. Sanchez, I want you to do a perimeter with a team, and I want the bomb squad-- Gunner, Gunner. It's not real. Oh, Lord. He's not real. What's going on? Where's the president? There is no president. What? There is no president. I don't understand. Did terrorists-- There are no terrorists. No terrorists, no election, no president, no more democracy. ODIN has been using us. That's why we invade one country after another-- So it can breed. You're recording this, right? Just keep recording and sending it to the station. Where's Barbara's feed? It must be some kind of a problem with the robot camera we gave her. Have you called her? There was no answer, but there's nothing for her to do until the debate's over. I suppose. Well, no more. Not on my watch. I want that boy out of here. Ed, can you hear me? Right here, right here. What do we do now? High, low. On two. One, two. Ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable. There is no president, no room of invited supporters. We've got to get Jarett and that bomb out of this building. ODIN will go to any extreme, even kill our own American heroes, to keep it secret. Cover. No one knows how long this-- Barbara. Barbara. What are you doing here? You all right? I can't move my legs. We'll get you out of here. No, no, have you found Jarett yet? He's somewhere in the building. I don't know where. The basement. They've got him in the old jail. How do you know? I've done a million stories on this place. It used to be the old federal building. We've got to get past them. No, there's another way. See that slot up there? It's part of the old surveillance tunnels. They connect every room in the building. Oh. There's a door behind that curtain. You just get in there. You can get to the basement and get Jarett out. Sanchez, send a bravo team. Go with Gunner. Go. Leave me the nine mil, another clip, and I'll be fine. Don't do anything stupid. We'll get you on the way out. Go, go, go, go, go. Where is Barbara? We have gunshot fire from within the Millennium Center. Communications have been compromised. Let's go quietly. Oh! Team, go! I'm here. Help, help. Help. You all right? Oh, my God, what's happening? Where's Uncle Benjamin? He's dead. Probably has been for years. But he's the president. Not anymore. What is this? I don't know. Some kind of 3-D scanner or something. Oh, God. Ahh. Ahh. Let's be very careful with this. Thank you. Don't thank me. There's a bomb in it. Go. Fall back. What's happening out there? As far as we know, the president is safe. But we can neither confirm nor deny at this time. What the hell are those? An Eyeborg no human ever designed. Coyle, what'd they do to you, man? Jesus. Come on. Gunner. Gunner, take the guitar. Get him out. I got you covered. No, Sanchez. Come back, San-- Barbara. Jarett! Jarett, son, come here, son. Come here. Look at me, look at me. I need you on your feet. All right? You understand? Okay! All right, give me your arm. Come on. Come on! Gunner, what happened to the others? Doesn't matter. We got to go. Oh, no. Oh, God. No, you can't move me. Yes, I can. Take Jarett. I can barely walk. Come on, we haven't got much time! No, you take Jarett and take these. These are the computer chips from my camera. They'll have everything that happened today. They'll be the last recorded video. It's the only proof you'll have of what happened. Barbara. I'm taking you out. Promise me you'll take these out. Promise me, Gunner! Promise me! Yes. I promise. All right, look, you promise me something-- Whatever comes through that door, do not move. They are programmed to attack. Do not move. And I will be back for you. I know. I know. I know. Come on, son. I'm getting you out of here. Come on, look at me. Look at me. You can do this. Put your arm around me. Again, I'm not sure if gunshots have been fired, or if it's something that sounds like gunshots. Standing by. Do you know what I've got here? The delete key. No. I, Thomas Rutledge, do solemnly swear-- I, Thomas Rutledge, do solemnly swear-- That I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States-- That I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States-- You are looking at history in the making-- Footage just released, showing the former vice president in an undisclosed location taking the oath of office and assuming his position as the next U.S. president. Welcome to Eyewitness News. I'm Jack Romero. And I'm Jill Coppola. The new commander-in-chief wasted no time deploying a coordinated assault involving army, navy and air force troops against the tiny, oil-producing nation of Zimbekistan. We have irrefutable proof that Zimbekistan is involved beyond the funds given to the traitor Jarett Hewes for his involvement in this terrorist assassination plot. Sad to say that we dare not trust anyone, not even our own relatives. My administration has just begun implementing sophisticated security provisions designed to protect you. With that, God bless you, and God bless America. Sam. Thanks, man. See you soon. What about that video? Everybody knows that videos can be faked. Regardless of the motives of people, they're designed to confused you, so you must ask yourself, each and every citizen of this country, ask yourself one question and one question only-- Who do you believe? A government that is sworn to protect you, or a ratings-hungry media beholden to no one? Dude, this outfit so does not work for me. Eyeborgs use visual pattern recognition. Besides, you look good in it. Really, man? Here? I mean, just-- It was either here or the exotic car wash. I thought this would be better for your soul. Hmm. Wanna know my preference? Oh, no, I don't. The world thinks I'm dead already. Look, we go public with this, and I get out there in front of cameras-- Trust me, it's been done with cameras before. Gunner, I can't just sit here and do nothing while people are out there dying. Barbara's--Barbara's video has gone viral all over the net. It's spreading like crazy, going peer-to-peer. Even ODIN can't stop it. So what do we do? Be patient. People aren't just accepting what they hear anymore. Things are changing. We have to stop the machine. We will. Have faith, my son. Thank you, Father. The Lord gave me my eyes to see for myself. I don't need yours anymore. Coming up next on Eyewitness News 44 HD, a nation mourns the loss of its longest-sitting leader since FDR and recalls his legacy. All the while, even under more tight security, the Vice President is sworn in as the nation's new commander-in-chief. Also, US condemnation of Zimbekistan for the attack, and threats of military retaliation against the tiny nation in response to the unprecedented-- No one knows how long ODIN has perpetrated this-- And builds a new coalition A president that's merely an artificial figurehead. ...nation. Uh, clearly some kind of technical problem there. Some kind of a ghost-like-- We're not quite sure what that was we just saw. Perhaps some kind of practical joke by somebody with a very sick sense of humor. But I'm sure the FCC and this network will investigate and prosecute those responsible. Meantime, we apologize for the interruption. We hope you'll stay with us through the break and into our next program. Stay tuned, and thank you. Was that--? Damndest thing I've ever seen. What do you believe?
