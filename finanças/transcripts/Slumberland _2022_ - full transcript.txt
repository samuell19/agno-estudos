People think dreams are an escape. A chance to slip away from waking life to a world with no consequence. But that's not true. Your dreams don't just happen. We make them happen. And we design them with care just for you. We have our reasons, and we have our rules. We make your dreams to help you on your journey. And where this one's going, she's gonna need all the help she can get. Good morning, Pig. Morning, Bugsy. Hey, Dad. What'd you get? Many leagues have I traveled across the sea to bring you breakfast. Oh. Thank you. Here. Here, let me help you with that. - Is that better? - Thank you. Yeah. Hey, Bugsy! All right. Batter up. Ooh! And… batter up. We on course, kiddo? The wind's come around. So what're you gonna do? Bow up. Bow up. A little more. Little more. Here ya go, kiddo. His name is Fred. Oh, hi, Fred. And I've got Seymour. Dad, why do I have to learn math if I'm gonna take care of the lighthouse, like you? I already know everything there is to know about the lighthouse anyway. Answer me this question. What is a lighthouse for? To keep ships safe. No. That's not what it's for. But when you can answer that question… I'll give you the key to the lighthouse, and that's a promise. Now, bed. You don't want Pig? I am 11. Well, sorry, Pig. It's a rite of passage. Hmm? What's that? Oh, no. No, you don't have to worry. I'll still be here for you. All right. Well, good night. Wait! - Hmm? - One story? Flip story? All right. I got one you never heard before. As you know, Flip and I, we lived the outlaw life. Hmm? Hunting treasure every night, and… eh, what have you. Now, one day ol' Flippy comes up to me, and he says, "Guess what I've heard." He's heard about these Pearls. Magic Pearls. You get one of these Pearls, and you can wish for whatever you want. The trouble was that these Pearls can only be found in the most dangerous waters known to mankind. The Sea of Nightmares. Well, soon as I heard that, I was all, "Count me out. I don't want anything to do with it." Then, of course, Flip, you know him, he goes and he does… the Double-Knock. And when your partner does the Double-Knock... - You can't refuse. - That's right. Outlaw Code. Set sail, we did. Well, I tell you what, it was cold. It was mighty cold. But I was thinking, well, in that kind of climate, Flip might not smell so bad. Then the storm came. And the waves. Suddenly there was this rumbling sound. It was all around us. And it grew louder by the second. It was the biggest, deadliest whirlpool I'd ever seen. That boom swung around, hit me on the backside, and tossed me into that water. And down I went, like a lead weight. Down… and down, until I noticed there was a hole right there in the bottom of the sea. So I swam in. What's on the other side? It's a dead place. No life of any kind, just littered with bones of ancient sea creatures. That's when it came for me. The monster. It rose up out of the darkness. Black as night, and bigger than any creature I had ever seen. With long, smoky, inky tentacles. I was frozen in fear. And it just, kind of slowly… …slowly… …reached out and grabbed me and shook me for all I was worth! And I take... Stand by. Wait, you can't stop now. What? You mean during the scary part? - It wasn't scary. - Mm-hmm. It was a potentially interesting start to a story. - Go for Peter. - Potentially… interesting start. Copy. Nemo, listen to me. There's a fishing boat off Lopez that's in trouble. It's gonna get bad out there tonight. Listen, you know what to do if the power goes out, right? Fire up the backup generator, clear the sump pump, radio Carla if there's a problem. I got it, Dad. Sweet dreams. Hey… I got you. Stop. Good night. Good night. I'll be back soon. Dad? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Carla? Carla, where's my dad? Nemo, he's gone, honey. He's gone. I'm sorry. Those were his wishes. Did he talk with you about any of this? Her mother died when she was a baby, so she's used to a single-parent household. She doesn't have anybody else. It's you, or she becomes a ward of the state. They'll stick her in a group home or in foster… Nemo, do you remember your uncle? No. I've never met him before. Your dad left instructions. If anything ever happened to him… He wanted you to go and stay with your uncle in the city. But I have to take care of the lighthouse. Nemo, you can't live alone. But I can do it. I know how. He's taught me everything. I'm sorry, honey. "For tho' from out our bourne Of Time and Place The flood may bear me far" "I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar" That's him. Hello? No, it's not a good time. My uh… My brother was lost at sea. Mm. No, lost lost. Like, I'm at his funeral. We were estranged, actually. Estranged. I'm… I'm happy with my plan. - Carla. - Hello. Hello. I'm so sorry for your loss. Our loss, obviously. Um, we can… We better hit the road if we're gonna catch the ferry. Uh, no shoes on the carpet. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No… It's a great building. You never have to leave. Which I basically never do 'cause I work from home. Sorry. There's a dry cleaner's, a coffee shop. They even have a, um… a spinning studio downstairs. Are you into spinning? Like spinning around? I don't know. I… I've never tried it. Hey… Do you like doorknobs? Ta-da! These are my babies. You're a doorknob salesman? I'm not… I'm not a doorknob salesman. I own a company that sells doorknobs. We sell latches. We sell escutcheons. Here's where we differ. A lot of the glamour boys in the industry, they chase the latest trends, not us. No, thank you. We'll stick with the classics. 'Cause it's security. It's not fashion. - Don't touch that. - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's not a toy. This is an antique. Came from a prison cell in Alcatraz. In case I need to lock you in your room. I... I... I'm not gonna lock you in your room. That was… humor. Do you need a hug or whatever? No. Well, good night. I know, Pig. I wish we could be with him again too. Pig. What? Wait! No. Don't! Stop, stop! Wait! Stop! Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. No! No, no, no! No! Stop! Stop! No, no, no, no, no! No! No! Red light. Stop! Red light! Come on, Pig. Thanks. Hi, Bugsy. Dad? Dad? Dad? Who are you? Uh… Nobody? I'm just one of those weird things that happens in dreams. Ignore me. I'm leaving now. Aww! Come back later. We're doin' dishes. 'Kay, so that didn't work. So, you're the kid. What are you doing here? And where's my dad? Nobody told you? I know what happened. Well, your dad and I were partners a long time ago, before he went straight and had a kid. Big mistake, in my opinion. Mad, bad, and dangerous to know. Named Flip. - You're Flip? - Yeah. I thought you were something my dad made up, and you're different than I imagined. Handsomer? More "gorgeous-er," if you will? Hairier. - And… …smellier. - Hmm. I mean, I know you're not real, but I always pictured, like, a normal human being. Okay, you just said like four insulting things on top of each other. Rude. Listen, I just came to pay my respects. Sorry for your loss. Hi-yah! By ripping my dad's room apart? Oh, that reminds me… …your dad, he had a map. About this big. Weird shapes and lines all over it. Picture with an oyster with a pearl on the back of it. It's one-of-a-kind, kid. We risked our lives stealing it. - I never saw any map like that. - Don't lie to me, kid! Your dad would want me to have it. I'm not lying. Never mind, I'll find it myself. Hey, you can't just bust in here like some kind of thief. You say thief like it's a bad thing. A thief just takes things that don't belong to them. You can't take things from other people's dreams. Sure you can. Ya just gotta know how to get in and get out. I'm in your dream. You're just a figment of my imagination. You wish you could dream up somethin' this good. Look at that. Mm! I look good. Please! I don't want you here. I just want my dad. Oh. Okay. What if there is a way you can see your dad again? What do you mean? I'm goin' on a little treasure hunt, and this treasure… is magic. Lets you wish for whatever you want here in Slumberland. I could see my dad again. Oh, yeah, you can see your dad again. Right here, every night. But I'm gonna need that map, kid. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, I believe you. Hey, wait! I can try to find the map. I can still come with you. Oh, that sounds super fun. Except you got no gear, no skills, and without the map… oh, you're useless to me. Time to wake up, kid. A map. Oh, you're up already. Good. What are you doin'? What's the weirdest dream you've ever had? I don't remember my dreams. Don't actually think I have any. I brought you some milk, right? Are you, uh, excited for your first day of school? School? This place should be amazing. It costs a fortune. My dad said schools are basically prisons. They keep kids locked up physically and mentally, prepare them for jobs that are also basically prisons, until they retire and go to a nursing home. Their final prison. School is not a prison. Can I leave whenever I want to? It's a little like a prison. Bell doesn't help. Nemo, hi. Welcome to Westbrook. - I am Ms. Arya, lower school counselor. - Hey. Hi. Well, I know what a… a difficult time this is but, um… Hey, do you know what the most resilient thing on earth is? It's not titanium. Is it tungsten? It has a higher tensile strength... The human spirit. Oh, you mean metaphorically. What you're going through, it's hard. But you know what? You are stronger than you know. Hey, can we talk for a sec? - Oh, yeah. - Just one sec. Uh… I, uh, just wanted to prepare you. Nemo's dad kinda raised her like a hermit. Not in a bad way, just… you have your work cut out for you. She… She's gonna need a lot of emotional support. Yeah. I mean, I'm hoping that you guys can help with all that. Oh. Well, we can't do that all by ourselves. No. - Right? - Right. Obviously. Is that not something you do? Look, I don't know how to take care of a little kid or talk about feelings. Now, I think that she would be better off literally anywhere else. Okay. Oh, you have my hands. Oy. You are capable of more than you think. Mm-hmm. Truly. You just gotta… You just gotta connect with a part of yourself that you're not used to accessing. Right. You just gotta connect with her. - Just try. - Okay. Hi, everyone. Hi. Thanks, Ms. Young. Hi, guys. How's everybody doing? This is Nemo. She's gonna be joining your class. So if you could all just make her feel right at home, I would be so grateful. Sorry. Okay, everyone. Listen up. In a victory for planet Earth, we got compostable utensils in the cafeteria. Oh. We won! Hmm. Uh, Nemo, Jamal. - Jamal, Nemo. - It's a seven-day cycle. You're late, you get a blue dot. Three blues, and you get a red dot, and your parents get a notification. And you can get the app for your phone. I don't have a phone. That is refreshing. You're gonna need the app, though. Any clubs you're into? I'm on recycling team, Model UN, ceramics club, Pop-Tarts, that's our improv group, lawn bowling, Slavic chorus, orchestra, woodworking, ultimate Frisbee… Where'd you go to school before this? I didn't. I was homeschooled. Um, my dad and I lived in a lighthouse. A lighthouse? That sounds awesome. Why'd you move here? My… My dad's on a trip. That's why I'm here. I'm staying with my uncle, just temporarily. Oh. Cool. Those are my Undeadheads. We dress up as zombies and watch zombie movies. It's cooler than it sounds… I think. Uh, come sit with us. Um, I… I need to do my math. Okay. I have a great activity we can do together. Lock picks. Probably from some master thief. Or maybe just a retiring locksmith. That cool? I first learned to do this when I was about your age. I was the first kid in school interested in door hardware. Now, the trick… is to move both slowly. Feel for the catch. Before you know it… Houdini who? Houdini me. That's Houdini who. That's a little… mantra. You don't have to say that. Wanna have a go? I'm a little doorknobbed out. That's fine. We can, um… We'll do something else. We'll, uh… Play soccer. We could play soccer. Wanna… uh, build a pillow fort? Are you reading a list off your phone? Yes. Yes, I am. I'm gonna just… Oh, sure. Totally. Pig? Pig, what are you doing? Oh my gosh, Pig. You found it. Come on, Pig. Let's go find Dad. Boring book, boring book, boring… See ya. Um, I have to check my schedule. Can I see your phone? Uh, yeah. Wait up! Look at you, using apps. See what happens when you try? Yup, just learnin' new stuff all the time. Oh, Flip. Come on, Pig. Flip? Flip? Flip? Flip! You. I found the map. I knew I liked you. - You tried to kill me. - I was trying to wake you up. Everybody knows you can't die in your dreams. You told me about this in my dream, and then I find it in the Waking World. How is that possible? Maybe the real world's bigger than you thought. Hey! It's my map. You can't just take it. Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you, kid. Taking people's stuff's kind of my thing. You said I could see my dad again. I'm coming with you. Listen, that's real sweet and all, and I miss your dad too, but you're not comin'! Go away. What was that? Double-Knock. He told you about the Double-Knock? You have to take me. Outlaw Code. Oh, don't tell me about the Outlaw Code. I'm one of the cocreators of the Outlaw Code. Before me, it was just one knock. This isn't some Girl Scout trip to Lollipop Land, okay? We're gonna have to travel through people's dreams to get to that treasure. So you get killed, it's on you. You said you can't die in a dream. I said you can't die in your dream. You die in your dream, you wake up. You die in someone else's dream, you don't wake up. Ever. I don't care. I'm coming. Fine. You slow me down, you screw things up, this map is mine, and you're on your own. - Deal. - Let me see your gear. Double-Knock. What is this? Extraordinary Knobs. It's my Uncle Philip's. He's a doorknob salesman. He has no friends, no life, and he makes me go to school. What a monster. Well, this'll put you to sleep faster than any sleeping pill. Okay, here. You hold on to this when you fall asleep. That way, you can find me when we're on the road. Okay? What the heck is that? He's a pig, and his name is Pig. Super creative. Fine. Bring him. I love bacon. All right. Look at this. The World of Dreams. This is a map of every dream in the world. Slumberland. Your dad and I used this map to go on all our adventures back in the day, jumpin' from dream to dream, to wherever we wanted to go. We swiped this map from a dream cop at the Bureau. She's been chasing me ever since. The Bureau? Bureau of Subconscious Activities, BOSA. Unfortunately for us, they're the bozos that decide what you get to dream. Unless you end up here. The Sea of Nightmares. Sea of Nightmares. My dad told me about that. That's where the Pearls are. Greatest treasure in the world. The sticky part is those dream cops at the Bureau don't want us to know they even exist. Because you get your hands on one of those bad boys, and you can wish for whatever you want here in Slumberland. And it's out of their control. I could see my dad again? If you don't die. Which you probably will. Oh my God. Your dad would kill me if he knew I was doing this. All right, listen, we're looking for reoccurring dreams. That way, we can get out the same way that we got in. Where's the door? What door? The Bureau puts in secret doors to connect the dreams. Civilians aren't supposed to know, unless you're a genius like myself. Hi-yah! Look out! Okay, that was definitely not here before. All right, we go through this door, everything changes. You slip up, you're dead. You'll never see the Waking World again. Okay. What are we waiting for? That's the spirit. All right. Welcome to my world, kid. Brand-new dream, still under construction. Ooh. Elegante. Spanish for "I look good." I'm a flippin' outlaw, so I don't play by the rules. But here's the rules. Rule number one, keep a low profile. We don't wanna get caught messin' around in other people's dreams, trust me. If the dream pigs catch you, they will... Oh. My bad, buddy. If the dream cops catch you, they will lock you up and throw away the key. Doomed to rot in a dingy Bureau prison cell for all of eternity till you cease to exist entirely. So blend in. Yeah, 'cause you totally blend in. Rule number two, stay focused. We're not here to have fun, okay? We get in, we find the next door, then we get out. Onto the next dream. Our one and only mission is finding those Pearls. Rule number three. We're not friends. We're not partners. I am the boss. El Jefe, 'kay? We do as I say, you got it? So rule number three's just a bunch of aggressive statements? Nobody likes a smart aleck, kid. - Excuse me. - Hey, buddy. What's up? Are you sure you're in the right dream? Ooh. I don't see you on my list. Mmm. The girl represents long-lost childhood. I'm a troubling mix of a father figure and raw, masculine power. Uh… And… what is this? Brother… …sometimes a pig is just a pig. Silly puerco. Yes. Library. Perdón. Uh… Do you party? No, I don't. You party. I party. Okay. - Gracias. - Okay. What was that? I don't know Spanish. That's the only word I know. Leave it to the pros. That's me. That's professional. Ooh, it's all about the Miss D, misdirection. Did you know that? Boop! I don't even know if this is real. Oh, that's real. Now we're talkin'. Who wants the Waking World when you got all this, huh? Oi! Agent Green. Bureau of Subconscious Activities. This the thieving punk you rang about? Cheers, mate. Our next door is behind the stage, yeah. And now, the Salsa Queen of Old Havana! There's our dreamer. - Classic repression dream. - What's that? - Well, you never heard of Freud? - Repression. All those feelings get bottled up, and they go busting out in Slumberland. I guarantee she's nothin' like that in the Waking World. Believe me. You see me? Yes. Hi-yah! Mm! What is that scent? Mm. It's au naturel. By Flip. Such raw, masculine power. Gracias. But at the same time… a deep sadness. Like a lost little boy, far from home. Huh? Dance with me. Hey! You said we weren't here to have fun. I said you're not here to have fun. I'm an outlaw. If I'm not havin' fun, I'm doin' my job wrong. - Know what I'm sayin'? - Hmm. Who's she? Go away, Nemo. You'll ruin the nice lady's dream. Buh-bye. Flip! What about the Pearls? Flip! Flip? Please! What the Flip? Oh… That's no bueno. Adiós. Let's get to that door, fast. Oh! Hello, Flip. Where's that map? Green. I've been waiting for this for a long time. The dream cop. You're under a... What… the…? "What the…?" Aww! Nightmare! Look out! Argh! No! Oh my God! Ew, yucky! Holy moly. It took years for me to shake that cop off my tuchus. First dream out with you, I get her and a nightmare? You're like a bad luck charm. And I don't get it. That nightmare flew right past the dreamer. Why the heck was it coming after us? I've seen it before. The night my dad died. It's yours. It's your nightmare. What? You brought the nightmare. Nightmares smell fear. It's tracking you, and nightmares won't stop until they get you. Do you ruin every party you go to? I've never even been to a party. I never should've brought you. Give me the map back. No. I did the Double-Knock. Give it to me! What is that? No, no, no. Don't... Don't wake up! Don't wake up! No, give me… give me the map! - Hey. - Uh, what are you doing here? Checking my mushrooms. Mushroom club. It's a… one-person club. Are you hiding out down here? No. 'Cause I mean, you weren't in class, and this looks a little bit like a secret hideout, so… School thinks I'm on a trip, and my uncle thinks I'm at school. Hardcore. Uh, you won't tell anybody I'm here, though, right? Omertà, the vow of silence. You can try some of my mushrooms. Just brush 'em off first. It's manure. It's not my poop, so it isn't weird or anything. Bye. See ya. Hey… …squirt. Can I take the… I wanna show you something really cool. You ready? Mm-hmm. And… surprise. I arranged with Carla to get it here, and I figured maybe this Saturday we could go sailing. I mean, you could go sailing. I'm strictly a dry-land guy due to my sensitive bowels. You should sell it or something. I don't think I wanna sail anymore. Nemo, I know this is hard. And different and scary. But I think it would be a mistake if you shut yourself off from the world, like your dad did. What are you talking about? Your dad was… different before. And then, when your mom died... My dad wasn't shut off. Nemo, he moved to an island. Do you ever go anywhere or do anything? Do you have any actual friends? Doorknobs don't count. I'm just saying, don't be afraid to… I don't know, have fun again. I'm not afraid of anything. - I'm gonna go to bed. - What? It's like 5:30. I know you wanna sleep all the time because you're sad. I know that feeling. But life is what happens when you're awake. Not mine! Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Damn it. This is interesting! You okay? I just wanna sleep. Maybe if you tried putting on some pajamas. This is what I wear to bed. Okay, well, what did your dad do to help you get to sleep? Sometimes… he'd tell me stories. Aren't you a little old for that? - Never mind. - No, it's fine. I can try to make up a story. Okay. Sorry, I didn't realize you were gonna be watching me. That's… That's fine. This is a story based on a true story about a man… On Christmas Eve… I think. Who took delivery of 30,000 porcelain doorknobs from a supplier in France, but instead of being three inches in diameter, these knobs were three centimeters. Try fitting a metric doorknob onto a standard escutcheon. What to do? You would need a Christmas miracle. But then our hero realized that these little knobs were the perfect size for standard cabinet drawer pulls. You must be exhausted. That was the exciting part. Good night, Nemo. Flip. Ah! Well. You came back. I'm impressed. - I'm proud of you. - Really? Nah. Go away. Go home. I don't have a home. Without that Pearl, I don't have anything. You don't get it, kid. Nightmares smell fear. And you, you're scared. I'm not scared. I mean it. Just take your feelings, crumple 'em up in a little ball, and shove 'em down deep. 'Cause I'm not doin' this for you. I'm doin' it for your dad. Same. Yeah? Yeah, double same. Pig! No. No pigs. Get outta here. Come on, Pig. So, who are you in the Waking World? Or… what are you? Don't remember, don't care. Haven't woken up for a long time. Well, I mean, you kinda have to wake up. Everybody wakes up. Not me. After your dad quit the game before he had you, I just kept goin', y'know? Door after door, dream after dream. Then I realized… …I don't have to wake up. You know, after a while, you sort of forget about the small details, like, uh, y'know, who I am. Anyhoo, when I get that Pearl, I'll have everything that I want. What are you gonna wish for? No more Agent Green would be nice. All I want is my dad. If I could see him, I don't really care what happens in the Waking World. Yeah, I miss your dad too. So, he told you all about me, huh? - Every night. - Yeah, man. We were a heck of a team. Goin' wherever we wanted, takin' whatever we wanted. We were tippy-top of the Bureau's most wanted list. Oh, man. Now I think I'm down to 13, but… I'm bouncin' back. I can feel it. Anyways… …I just can't get a bead on this next door. It keeps movin'. Oh man. The door is in the truck. Shh. - Cool. Cool. - Cool. Cool. Cool. - Yeah, right? - Mm-hmm. Aww! You party? - Yeah, you party. - Yeah, I party so hard. Huh? - Clear. - Aww! Yeah! Yeah. Shred the gnar! Who dreams of driving a garbage truck? Don't judge. At least it's original. It's not like, "Oh my God, I didn't study for the test. Where's my pants?" Or, uh, "Hey, I'm ridin' a giant goose, eh?" I've never heard of the giant goose one before. Most popular dream in Canada, kid. Look it up. Green. Flip! Flip! Oh! Flip, help! Flip, help! Green. Look! Look at how strong I am. Ta-da! Hurry, the door's in the cab. You gotta be kidding me. She does not give up. Yeah, she wants her map back. Oh, no. Whoa. This is awesome. What kind of maniac is drivin' this thing? Go! Go! Go! Go! Oh, hello. ♪ The wheels on the bus… ♪ I'm driving my truck. That explains the poor cornering skills. Killer tats. Drive your truck faster, sir. Oh, boy! Where's the door? Uh… Oh, here it is. Here, hold on to that. Hold on. It's locked. Of course it is. Awesome. That's not ideal. Oh, great. Again, not ideal. Keep it together, kid. - I can do this. - Oh, man. You're a nightmare magnet. Hey. We did it! Yeah! Yeah! Ah! Yeah. Whoo! That's what I call a getaway. I thought you were gonna lose an arm. - I thought it was gonna get gross. - What are you doing? Normally I drip-dry, but I learned this little ditty from a real gangster's dream. Pretty rebellious, you know? Now put your hands up, ready?

We're gonna make an outlaw outta you yet. Run! Whoo! You made me work for it, I'll give you that. Finally, I can retire, get some sun. Thirty years. Thirty years chasing your sorry butt for mucking up people's dreams. I'm 160. I should have retired ages ago, but no. I couldn't clear your flippin' name off my board. Well, I got you now. All-inclusive. One of the top-rated dreams in Slumberland. I'll be sure to send you a postcard. In jail, of course. Whoo! Not like there's any glory in it. Whoop-de-do! I caught Slumberland's 28th most wanted. Twenty-eight? Try 13. You're slippin', mate. - Right. You're under arrest. - Aww! You got nothin'. You brought a squid to a salsa party. Do you think that's funny? Put it that way, it's kinda funny. Right? Oh, okay. With popcorn, they're delicious. Pick those up. You just put those in there. I know I didn't do that. I stole that fair and square. - Where's my map? - Your map? It's ancient history. I have no idea where that map is. And who's this? Your bodyguard? Who, her? Yeah, I dragged her along. Got nothing to do with it. It was all me. You've done a lot of crime, Flip. You're gonna do a lot of time. As in forever. All right, let's get you locked up and find that map, why don't we? I'm actually gonna miss hunting you down. Oi! Here. If it makes you feel any better, you could just let me go. Hmm… Nah, it's gonna make me feel really good to lock you up. You make that sound kinda fun. Whee! That was inappropriate. I'm… I'm sorry. You think you're this big man. - But you're just a pathetic little... - Hey, Cindy. Oh! Hey, Frank. Cindy? 160-year-old Cindy. Sassy Cindy. Sorry, Cindy. So, uh, still over in Oedipal dreams? Uh, no. They moved me to 6200. Oh. That's exhausting. Hey, at least I get my steps in, right? - Mm-hmm. - Aww! Waffle? You're just a pathetic little man-boy. - Thank you. - Mm. We run a finely tuned machine here. We can't have losers like you botching up the works. And I've met punks like you before. "Whoo-hoo!" "Slumberland, just one nonstop party!" "I'm never gonna leave!" And then one day, you realize… you're all alone. You've got no friends, no family. No one gives a damn about you, all because you didn't want to wake up. What do you think I'm tryin' to do? Well, now you'll just be a vague memory. Flip, you had a good run. Mm. But now, you're done. No! No! No! No! Please! Stop! Stop! No! Forget it, kid. We're in here for good. What do we do now? There's nothing we can do. I thought you didn't wanna wake up. I can't. When you stay in Slumberland too long, you forget everything. I just thought if I got that Pearl, I could remember who I am. I just wanna wake up. She's right. Nobody gives a damn about me. I do. Bodyguard, come with me. What about him? Oh, he's checked in for good. But he can't help it. - He doesn't remember who he is. - Chop-chop. Well, now he can remember. He's got loads of time. Sorry it didn't work out, kid. Not many people get to peek behind the curtain. Want to see where the magic happens? Welcome to the Bureau of Subconscious Activities. Clearly, management hasn't updated our wardrobe or the facilities since the early '70s, 'cause the Bureau blows its budgets on the dreams, and we get the leftovers. So, two ways this can go. You can end up like Flip, alone, in a cell forever. Or I can cut you loose, but I'm only going to do that if you've learnt your lesson. Otherwise, you can go straight to rot in a cell in juvie. So, looks like you're going through some stuff. We gave you the lighthouse dream. That's your safe place. The nightmares can't get you there. But my dad's not there. I wanna see my dad. Yeah, we don't give you what you want. We give you what you need. Everything in Slumberland happens for a reason. You're messing with a finely tuned machine here, love. Then give me a dream with my dad. - And I'll never leave. - Yeah. No dream lasts forever. All right? Sooner or later, they all fade. You're gonna visit the lighthouse for a little while, and then it's gonna be gone, then you'll have other dreams. You'll move on. I don't wanna move on. If you don't move on, the nightmares will find you, and they will destroy you. Then how do I make them go away? By being brave. And when you're brave enough, then they can't hurt you. I'm not afraid of anything. Being brave isn't about not being scared. It's about doing what you have to do, even when you are. And I know you're not afraid of car chases or jumping off cliffs. I'm talking about what you're really scared of. Being alone. Someday, you're gonna find something new. Something so important that you're going to stop trying to hold on to what's already gone. And when that happens, that big scary squid that's been chasing you around? It'll vanish into thin air. No more nightmares. Until puberty. Yeah, that whole thing's a frickin' nightmare. You think some magic Pearl's gonna solve all your problems? Let me let you in on a little secret. There are no Pearls. It's a myth. Stay where you belong. Nemo, you have the dream you're meant to have. We make sure of that. Time to wake up. Hey. Can't sleep? Me neither. You know, things get darkest right before the dawn. The world's stupid that way. I'm never gonna see him again. I wanna show you something. Sit down. I haven't looked through this stuff in years. Ooh. Where is…? Ah. Come on. That's your dad. That's my dad? I worshipped him back then. Your dad and I, all we really had was each other. He told me stories too… every night. Wild adventures we were gonna go on. Long-lost treasure we were gonna find. We lived in a fantasy world. Probably 'cause it was better than the real world. Red string? Right, that was our special trick for finding each other in our dreams. Your dad and I were convinced we'd figured out how to meet up in our dreams and go on those adventures. Flip? How'd you know about that? You're dressed like Flip. I don't understand. Flip was my outlaw name. I was pretty shy. When I was with other kids, I barely spoke. But when I was with your dad in our dreams, I could be whoever I wanted to be. And for me, that was Flip. And then your dad met your mom, and she was so great. Looked just like you. And um… they decided to have a real adventure. I begged him not to go. But off they went, sailed around the world. And then I was alone, and I shut down, even worse than before. You said you don't remember your dreams. - That's when it started, right? - Yeah, I guess. I was pretty broken up about it. I didn't sleep for three nights. And after that, no more Flip. I was just Philip. Your dad would call from time to time to check in, and he'd tell me about all his crazy adventures. And he'd ask me what I was doin', and… I'd have to tell him all about my boring life. So after a while, I just… let him go to voice mail. Anyway… ancient history now. I moved on. I'm sure he did too. I have to go back. I mean, I have to get ready for school. Uh, ready? What? It's like 5:00 a.m. I've got a lot to do. Can I borrow your lock picks… for school? Go ahead. Take 'em. My dad didn't move on. He told stories about you every night. Nemo. Hey. I gotta go. I heard Davenport and Arya talking about her. You know why she moved here, right? Her dad died. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Hey, kid. I'm driving my truck. I know. You, out. Long-lost childhood. Babies. Obviously. Oh, well. Time to make the doughnuts. Have a nice day. Shh! You came back for me. You gotta come for your partner, even if he's a pain in the... - Applesauce! - Tie this while I get you outta here. Oh, I know. Pickin' locks? I knew you were an outlaw. - Houdini who? Houdini me. - That's Houdini who. Yes! Ahh! - Whoa, check this out. - What do we got here? Hey. Aww! Say, uh, I'm from juvie, and this guy was stealin' from us. Toys, candies, puppy dogs. Yeah, you got nothin' on me, kid. You like wreckin' kids' dreams, scumbag? You like tearin' the heads off of teddy bears, huh? Huh? Huh? How 'bout I tear your head off? Guys, take me away. She's so mean. Juvie, man. They do not mess around. Mm-mm. Yo, I gotta bail. - Right. - Okay, see you after lunch. Mm-hmm. Ow! Is this really necessary? Hi-yah! - Well, that's awkward. - You must be having a laugh, mate. Uh-uh-uh. Let's see how tough you are without that thingamabobber. Okay. Want some of this, do ya? - Yeah? Ready for it? - Yeah! Oh, man. You're so tough for a 160-year-old lady. You're under a... It's all about misdirection. You're gonna make me really regret being so nice to you. Yes. Excuse me, Cindy. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Pardon me. Uh… How's this gonna work? Oh, boy. - There ya go. Ah, okay. - Ow. Oh. Oops. Uh… Here we go. And you. - Hey, here. - Oh. - Get a "momento." - Ah. - Yeah, right. - Say cheese. From age! Perfect. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, not sorry. All right. Okay, hey, look. Okay. Yeah. This elevator's gonna take us right where we wanna go. The last stop before the Sea of Nightmares. We're gonna get our Pearls. Yeah, about that. I have to tell you something. Okay, well, just wait a second. Classic, right? Yeah. There are no Pearls. What're you talking about? It's a myth. Agent Green told me. And you believed her? She was just tryin' to keep you in your place. It ain't no myth, believe me. - How do you know? - 'Cause your dad saw them. We were there. Sea of Nightmares? Yeah, he went all the way down the whirlpool. All the way to the bottom. And then he saw the Pearls, thousands of 'em. Your dad had the greatest imagination… but he would never lie. We can't go back. We're not goin' back. C'mon, kid. Ooh, it's bright. Much better. Okay, here we go. Pig! Come on, kid! The final door's gotta be out here somewhere. Keep goin'! Go! Go! Hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa. So, what do we do now? Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoa! Oh, hey there! How about this view, eh? - Canada? - Like I said, number-one dream. Go away! Eat this, Green! Yeah! - Come on, Flip! - What're you doin'? - The geese! - Oh, but you're crazy! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Whoa, hey! You think that's a thing of beaut? Well, let me tell ya, there's a Timmies. That's a Tim Horton's for ya. Pert near 20 clicks that way... - Hey, buddy. - Oh, yeah, eh? I wanna swipe your gooser here, eh? Uh, yeah. Sure, bud. Scooch my goose. Keep your stick on the ice! Ooh. Right down there. Yeah! Whoo! Oh, man. Hey, Bob? That was awesome. Bye, Bob. I think you and I should be partners. What do you think? Look, there's something I need to tell you. There it is! I found it before you! Race ya! Last one there is a rotten dream! Wait, wait, wait. Be cool. Be cool. Be cool. Whoa, whoa. It's the final door. And it's open. - Which is a first. - Why are you being quiet? - 'Cause it's scary. - And dark. - Yeah, and dark. - And creepy. Yeah. Hey! I was just makin' sure no one's in there. Well, you know, it's the gateway to the Sea of Nightmares, so… Pearls are in here somewhere. All right. Okay. Ready? Here we go, partner. - I don't wanna go first. - It's okay. - But I'm scared. - It's an initiation, so… - Okay. - All right. Oh. It's cold. Whoa. That's a whole lot of water. Okay. Gonna go for a little swim. No big deal. I know who you are. Huh? I found out in the Waking World. Why the hell didn't you tell me? Wait. Do I still have my hair? Yeah. Just not as much. Let me guess. I'm a famous outlaw, yeah? Men fear me? Ladies love me? You're a doorknob salesman. What'd you call me? You're my dad's brother, Philip. You and my dad came to Slumberland every night when you were kids. And then, he left. Oh, wow. After that, Philip stopped dreaming, and you couldn't wake up. I remember. But when you get your Pearl, you can wake up, and you can be one person again. This is a buzzkill. I'm gonna get us both killed for that guy? We're so close, and he needs you. Well, I don't need him, all right? I got everything that I want right here. Wine, women, waffles. The three dubs. Not necessarily in that order. I'm not a knob seller. I'm a flippin' outlaw! But I thought that when we get our Pearls, I could be with my dad at night, and during the day, I could be with you. You could be like my part-time dad. I am nobody's dad, kid. So you're just giving up? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go find a dream with a bar in it, and then I'm gonna drink until I forget who I am again. Then I'm gonna go find someone's ex. 'Cause there's a lot of them around here. But I… I did the Double-Knock. So did I, kid. The night your dad left, I begged him to stay. I'll go without you. I'll see my dad again, and I don't care if I never wake up. Hey, no. You can't. It's too dangerous to go in alone. You can't tell me what to do… 'cause you're not my dad. I never should a brought you. Just go back to where you belong. Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me. Nemo. Nemo. Wake up. Wake up! Nemo? Get your things. We're calling your uncle. It's not just the lying, Nemo. It's sneaking off like that. No one knew where you were. For all we knew, you could've been in terrible danger. Yeah. Why would you do that? You wouldn't understand. Why don't you try me? Okay. Well, m... Maybe it would help if, uh… if you went first. Philip? Would you like to tell Nemo how you're feeling? I don't know what you want me to say. I don't do feelings. Everyone does feelings, whether you like it or not. You two are in the same boat. You just don't realize it. Guys, come on. You're both struggling with powerful emotions, and you just… you just need to deal with them. Do we, though? Um, everybody always says that, but… I'm not convinced. I... I... I've I've never dealt with my feelings, and I'm fine. I was fine. Should've just had them send me to foster care. You'd probably be better off. At least foster parents know how to be parents. Nemo, we should probably talk. I don't wanna talk. You wanna get rid of me, so get rid of me. I'm not trying to get rid of you, Nemo. I'm… I'm trying to help you. You're as bad as he is. What? Who? You only care about yourself. Are you kidding? I have done nothing but take care of you. I... I... I cook. I... I entertain. I try. And what do I get in return? You just lie to my face. I think we're bonding, and I let you borrow my precious lock picks so... Nobody cares about door stuff, okay? Why do you think you have no friends? Why do you think you live alone? You should go to your room! Where do you think I'm going? You're not my dad! Hey, I'm not trying to be! I live alone because I like it that way! I didn't ask for any of this to happen. I didn't ask you to come live here! But I'm glad you did. Pig, we're goin' home. Nemo? No, I don't know. I don't... Carla, I don't know. I just woke up, and she wasn't here. Well, I have no idea where she would go. Right. Pig! Whoo! Ha! Oh, yeah. Oh! The End of the Line! It's party time! Yeah, baby! Oh! Number one! Top of Slumberland, baby! ♪ Baby, baby, baby! ♪ ♪ Baby, baby, baby! ♪ Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah. You see that? Hope they catch the bastard. Oh, yeah. Guy seems like a real bad egg. You know? Pee-yew. He took a little girl to the Sea of Nightmares, and then he ditched her, and she went in alone. - What? - Yeah. Hey, you're… A shiny pink diamond? - Yeah. Pretty, isn't it? Hi-yah! - That's nice. Come on, Pig. Grab one, and let's go. Yeah! Flip? Flip! Yeah! I got ya. Oh! Get in the cab! You came back for me! Yeah. Outlaw Code. Never leave your partner behind. - Even if she is a pain in the… - Applesauce. Applesauce! Oh! I got a Pearl. Oh! Aces! So long, suckers! Whoo! Oh, hey! Hey, guys! Nightmare! Whoo! We have to get to the lighthouse! Green said it's my safe place! I know! Don't look down! - Pull up! - I am! Oh my! Oh my! No! Drive the plane! Flip, come on. Flip! Aw, jeez. What a gong show. Okay, one minute, you think you're going out for a rip… Oh. Hey, sorry, guy. And the next thing you know, you're goin' for a dip. There he is. Get in here! Come on. Hey, Emmett, you party? I party. Whoa! Come here! Get in here! Hey, Emmett, take a right. Here we go. - I can't. I can't. What's that? - Come here, buddy. Hit it, Emmett! Yeah! Help! Oh, my hair! My hair! I knew you'd return! I smelled your musk. Uh, sí, sí, sí. Pero no. Aww! Pero no. Now, McRoy to center. There's O'Reilly… Great pass to Johnson, and a goal! - He scores! - Yes! Let's go! Let's go! Whoo! We're gonna make it, kid. Come on. I see the lighthouse. Come on, kid. We're almost there. You can finally make your wish. What's wrong? Oh… I don't feel so good. Nemo! Hey, slow down! Slow down! Pig. What's wrong? Something's not right. I'm gonna get you home. You'll be safe at home. There! There! Wait, the Pearl. I dropped the Pearl. We have to go back. You get to the lighthouse. I'll get the Pearl, okay? Go. Wait. No, not without you! Flip! Yes! Flip! Flip! Nemo! Nemo, go! Get to the lighthouse! Say hi to your dad for me. Flip? Wake up. Philip! What are you doing? No! Get down! Philip! Philip! No! Let's go home. Well, this is gonna be a butt load of paperwork. So Nemo, how do you feel? Different? Big journey, all by yourself. I see you've found yourself a Pearl. Guess it's not a myth after all. I didn't get my dad back. You had to give up your dream. I guess you found something more important. Right, better get to work, then. Oh, uh… You've got a good pig there. Give it a squeeze for me. Told you. You have the dream you're meant to have. We make sure of that. What you do next…? Well, that's up to you. Ugh! Seriously? Look at this mess! Can I get a cleaning crew in here pronto? Come on! I missed you so much. I miss you. Race you to the top? Help! - Nemo! She's not breathing. - Okay. We got her! We got her. It's okay. Okay. Did you ever figure it out? What the lighthouse is for? It's not to keep ships safe. No. If we wanted to do that, we'd never let 'em leave harbor, would we? Nothing. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six. - Come on, Nemo! - Seven, eight, nine. - Breathe! - Come on. Oh. To guide you on your journey. That's right. So you can see things that the lighthouse keeper can only dream of. I didn't teach you all those things so you could live on an island. I did it so that you could know… You can do anything. Okay, come on, Nemo. Come on. One, two, three… I didn't think I could go on without you. You traveled to the Sea of Nightmares and came back home safe again. After that, I don't think the Waking World's gonna be too difficult. But that's up to you. Life is waiting for you, Nemo. It would be a shame to miss that. I have to go back. That's my girl. And you never forget… How very proud I am of you. And keep an eye on that brother of mine. He seems normal, but he's not. Deep down, he's a wild man. Bye, Dad. Okay, let's go! Come on, get her over! There we go! Good girl, Nemo! Good girl! Good girl. You're okay. You're okay. I got you. And I'm not gonna let go of you ever, okay? Flip? Yeah. It's Flip. And Philip. Philip and Flip. Flilip? - Okay, see ya! - Bye! Bye! Bye, Jamal. See you tomorrow. See ya. You know, not a lot of people know this, but I'm actually a master pickpocket. Oh, come on. No, you're not. Boop! - Oh my G... - You have very smooth wrists. Wait. What? How did you…? I'm gonna take you sailing. Maybe next time you can come with us. Yeah, I'd love to. Aces. Oh. Oh, wait. I need my watch back. Yeah. No. No, seriously. Can I get my watch back? Call me. Oh, great. You're already dressed for bed. Well, I don't like to be late. So, what's the plan tonight? I don't know. I think I might just wander and see what happens. Sounds good. - Night-night, kiddo. I love you. - I love you too. I'll try to be on time. Sweet dreams.
