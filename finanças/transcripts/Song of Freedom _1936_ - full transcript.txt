(bright music) (moves into upbeat music) (moves into tribal music) (natives chanting) (Queen Zinga laughing) - So you would be king, Nogwala. You would take Zinga's throne. All right, you shall be king for one minute before you die. (Queen Zinga laughs) Kill! - Please, please! (woman screams) (native shouting) (natives speaking in foreign language) (natives shouting) (dramatic music) (soft music) (native speaking in foreign language) (man snoring) - What do you want? (Nogwala speaking in foreign language) What's that? (Nogwala speaking in foreign language) Oh, Pele, Pele, Pele. What's he talking about? (Pele and Nogwala speaking in foreign language) - They say they want to come with you. - Oh. - They ran away from Zinga on the island. He's our son. There have been a killing going on. - A killing, eh? - Are the oars ready? What have you got here? - They want to take a trip along with us. - Well, they seem all right? - All right? Royal blood, me lad. Go on, get them along. Get them along before they change their mind. (Pele speaking in foreign language) (soft) (slaves chattering and shouting) (tribal music) (singing in foreign language) (majestic music) (chains clanging) (machinery whirring) - Hey! Monty, come over here. - [Bert] What do you want? - Come over here. - What's the matter now? You leave a man alone five minutes? - Five minutes, well, you ain't done any work all day. Go on, get on with it, get all of it. Go on, put a jerk in it? - You done always give me the heavy end. - Are you going to help me with this or are you not? - How can I help you when you're sitting down on it? - I asked you a straightforward question. I expect a straightforward answer. - I straightforward you myself in a minute. - All right, Samson. Get down there. - Oh! (Monty groaning) What's the matter with you? That's light as a feather. Blinking elephant's feathers, that's what I call that.

You keep on singing the same little bit. - I don't know any more. - Well, it sounds like him to me. Where'd you hear it? - Don't remember. It's been in the back of my head since I was a little fellow. - Was you ever a little fellow? (dock workers laughing) - [Bert] I read in the papers this morning about a man. - [Paparazzi] Oh, Mr. Donozetti, I heard the delegate- (paparazzi chattering) - Now look here, of course, I see a report. Now one moment. Perhaps you'd like to hear what the papers have to say about my work in Berlin. - You go and find the car. I'll give him a wave before he invites them all to dinner. Go and find the car. - Yes. - Just a second. No, here's a really good one. - What about the new opera? - Which one? I have one, two, three, four, five. - Excuse me, gentlemen. Mr. Donozetti has an important appointment in town. - The fifth opera which I am now composing will be a masterpiece. - What's it called? - You'll read all about it in the papers. - No good to me, I never read the paper. - Wise man, neither do I. ♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪ ♪ And the walls come a-tumblin' down ♪ ♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho, Jericho, Jericho ♪ ♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪ ♪ And the walls com a-tumblin' down ♪ ♪ Up to the walls of Jericho he marched with spear in hand ♪ ♪ Go blow them ram horns, Joshua cried ♪ ♪ 'Cause the battle am in my hand ♪ ♪ Then the lamb ram sheep horns begin to blow ♪ ♪ Trumpets begin to sound ♪ ♪ Joshua commanded the children to shout ♪ ♪ And the walls come a-tumblin' down ♪ ♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho, Jericho, Jericho ♪ ♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪ ♪ And the walls come a-tumblin' down ♪ - Listen! - Huh? - What's the matter? - What an amazing voice! What, it's unique. Never have I heard such a voice. There he is. A colored man. Look, I must speak to him. I must find out who it is. - Oh, you can't stop it now. - You can't be talking to village people in the middle of the day. - Rubbish. - Of course not, it's absurd. - A voice like that can be interviewed anywhere. To hear a voice like that and to lose it, it is a crime, a blasted crime. Don't argue with me like that. Don't argue, do as I tell you. There, we've lost him. (dock workers laughing) - Hello, boys, how are you? - Got any champagne? - What? - I said, have you got any champagne? - Yes. - Good, then mind us a beer. (dock workers laughing) Same for you! - [Barkeep] Where to this time, Eddy? - Africa, pushing out tonight. - Going to Africa? Which part? - West Coast, know it? - No. - What part do you come from then? - I don't know. Wish I did. - He's at it again, the same old subject, Africa. - Well, they can have this blooming ship as far as I'm concerned, I've just got supplies. (barkeep laughs) Well, so long now. - That's it, old Eddy boy! Fetch us back a parrot, will ya? (patrons chattering) - Have another? - Huh? No, thanks. - So you'll sing songs tomorrow night, Johnny? - Of course he's coming in. We're all coming in, I'm bringing my girl to dinner! - Is that so? Then I'm going to bring my chopper. - Go on, have another one. - No, I'll be getting along. - Oh, there's plenty of time. - Well, if you don't mind, Ruth'll have my dinner ready. And I don't like to keep her waiting. - That's just where you make your mistake, my lad. The more you keep them waiting, the more they like you. Now, look at me. I go home when I like. I stay out when I like. And my Nell, she feeds out of me hand. If I like to stay here all eve- - Bert Puddick, dinner. So long. (patrons laughing) - Hey, boy, I thought you were going to always do what you wanted to do. - Well, you've got to give in sometime. - That's all right, Bert. You're just like the rest of us. The women start talking, and we just got to do what they say. - I wouldn't even give a penny for your thoughts, John. - Wouldn't you? - No. I know what they are. - Met a fellow in the pub coming home. Sailing for Africa tonight. They'll be casting off about now. In a week or two, he'll be on the coast. - Africa. It's always Africa, isn't it, John? - After all, that's my home. That's where we come from. I wonder which part. I'm always wondering. Perhaps there. Or there. What wouldn't I give to know? - But you're happy here. The people are kind. - Oh, I know. Well, they're grand people, Bert and Nell and the fellows down at the docks. But somewhere in those parts are our people, Ruth. And I've got a feeling they're grand people too, the people we belong to. I even know the direction it lies. This window points right south. If we could see hundreds and hundreds of miles. It's funny. That fellow didn't want to go. It's natural. He's leaving his people to go out among strangers. He'll be sort of out of place. Lonely, maybe. However hard I try, I always feel the same here, out of place. Wouldn't it be grand if one of these days we could- Why, honey, what's the matter? - You'll never be satisfied here, John. Whatever I do to make this home, it'll never be really home to you, will it? Perhaps it's my fault. - Honey, you can't say things like that. You know you mean everything to me. - Not everything, John. - Now, now. - I, I can't take you to Africa. But, but if there's anything in this world I can do for you- There's one thing you can do right now. Oh, Monty, now look what you've been and gone and done. - Now, be sure we don't lose none of them pieces. - I've given all this time trying to put it together.

Drive me crazy! - After all, there are plenty of other singers. What about the, the, tenor from- - Plenty of other singers, yes, I know. They come to me in the hundreds. And they're roaring like lions or cooing like, like the gentlemen of the harem. And when I hear a voice like this, a voice that one hears once in a, in a- - Lifetime. - You see, we cannot stop!

I must find that man. I cannot live until I find, go find him. - I say, do you think we ought to- I mean, if he's going- - Don't worry, he'll be back in a minute. - I say, what's that you got on your third finger? - A rubber band I got off a package. - Oh! - Why? - Oh, nothing, nothing. It gave me quite a... I'd say, it is hot in here, isn't it? - Mr. Donozetti's car, please. I expect you'll find him quite easily. I should think they all know him. Why not try the do dock master? - Yes, that's a very good idea. I say, it's a jolly funny thing about that rubber ring thing, wasn't it? On your finger, I mean? - Was it? - Course I didn't think it was anything else. Course I didn't, on your finger like that. No, no, no, not on that finger anyway. Only I did think that- (Marian sighs) Course if, if it had been the other finger- - If he waits any longer for you, he'll burst. - Heh. (crowd murmuring) (piano music) - Johnny, you've got that tune on the brain. - Wish I could get it. - That reminds me of Africa. They go on like that for hours and hours. Do you come from Africa? - I wasn't born there. Most of us colored folks come from there originally. - Yeah, we've got rhythm deep down inside. (lively music) Whoa! Now, you're going to ruin it. - You don't seem to appreciate good music when you hear it, Monty. - Yeah, I appreciate it, all right. But I just don't like it. - All right, let's get started. Order, please. Quiet, please. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now about to begin our sing song. I've got a good program for you this evening. (patrons shouting) All right, all right. - Did you say he was a colored man? - Yes. - Big fellow? - Yes. - Wearing a dark suit? - Yes. - Well, there's about 200 like that down here. - Yes, but my dear fellow, they're not all singers, surely. - Oh, it's a singer you're looking for? - But of course. Who else but a singer should I, Donozetti, be looking for? - Donozetti? Oh, pleased to meet you, sir. - Thanks very much, but- - Matter of fact, I got a daughter. She's very ought at this here crooning. Everybody says she ought to go on the stage, you know, with one of them dance bands. I suppose there's no chance? - Chance? Oh, explain to the idiot. Explain. - Mr. Donozetti doesn't keep a dance band. He presents an opera. - Oh, that. Can't think of anybody as I could recommend for that. Except John Zinga, perhaps. Now, there's a voice, if you want to hear one. - And who's John Zinga? - One of the darkies here, great big fella. Sings all day long. - That must be the man. Where can I find him? - Well, they're having a bit of a sing song over in the Crown and Anchor. I expect he'll be there. - Crown and Anchor, that's probably the local hotel. Where is it? - Over there, can't you hear them? - Come along, come along. - Thank you very much. (audience cheers and applauds) - Quiet, please, quiet. Ladies and gentlemen, there's something I know you'd all like to hear. I have much pleasure in announcing the next item on our program this evening. It will be your old friend, Johnny Zinga!

I am lucky to have heard it. You are lucky too, I am Donozetti. Come and see me tomorrow, we will talk. - But I am working at the docks. - You'll see no more of the docks. With me, you have a great future. Your wife, huh? - Yes, but- - Oh, I congratulate you both. You have the world before you with a voice like that, oh! Bring him to me tomorrow, you'll see what I can do. - Do you mean he could earn his living by singing? - Make a living, oh, a career. A fortune. It's agreed, tomorrow at my hotel, 11:00, huh? Here is my card. (Donozetti speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) - John, take your hat off. - Yes? - The gentleman asked us to call. - Which gentleman? Appointment? - Yes, sir. - This way. - Don't call him sir. - No, what shall I call him? - Call him nothin'. - These people want to see Mr. Donozetti. - Name, please? - Mr. John Zinga. - And Mrs. Zinga. - Wait. Take a seat. There, 11 o'clock, he has not come. We should have sent for him. (bell rings) (claps) Huh, answer the phone. Answer quickly! Answer, answer. Yes? - Yes. - Yes, send him up at once, please. There you are, he's here. - Ah, he has come! I'm so happy. Now, if I've not found a great artist, a real artist, I am not Donozetti. (calm music) Mr. And Mrs. John Zinga. (Donozetti speaking in foreign language) - Oh, my friends, at last. I thought you were never coming. Look after the lady. I'm delighted to see you. I cannot tell you what a joy it is to me. We'll waste no time. To work at once. Now, come along. A note, Blaney. (Donozetti singing) Come along, come along, come along, come along. (John singing) No! Stop. The breathing is all wrong. You see, the method for the breathing- they come from the diaphragm. So, and the voice, it come from here. So you see, voice, breathing. Breathing, voice.

(Donozetti singing) (piano music) - You want me to do that? - Yes, please. (John singing) (piano music) - Good. Not let's go higher. (Donozetti and John singing) - I came here to sing, not to make these noises. - But my dear fellow, Mr. Donozetti really wants to help you. It's part of your training. - I don't want any training. You smack me in the stomach, and I sing, la, la, la. Always been able to sing on the docks without being smacked in the stomach. And what's more, I can't sing with all this stuff on. I like to be comfortable. I'm not a tailor's dummy. - John. - Well, if they want me to sing, I've got to be free, not trussed up like a chicken. Can I sing you a song instead of this la, la, la. - That will come later. - I don't like this, I want to go home. - But John, you must be patient. This gentleman only wants to do something for you. - What can you do for me? - I can teach you to sing. - I can sing already. I sing because I like it. - With me, you'll have a career. - I'm earning my living all right on the docks. - You're finished with the docks. Now, wouldn't you like to have money to spend, money to buy beautiful things for your wife, everything she wants? - John, we might even be able to travel. - Yes, travel. We go to all the great cities for you to sing! - Travel. - Perhaps some day, we might even- do you think he'll ever go to Africa? - Someday even Africa, perhaps. It's quite possible. Your home? - Somewhere out there. I don't know where. I don't even know which people I belong to. But I've always wanted to go there. I might be able to find out. - But this may be your chance, John. - Big doors, big rooms, big houses, big countries. - John, we are not afraid, are we? - All right.

Enjoying yourself, honey? I should say I am. It's one of the finest parts I've seen you in. You're marvelous. - I'm even enjoying it myself. Strange that I should be playing this part, a black ruler who built an empire of slaves. I'll be happy when this act is finished, though. This is the hard one. - You've nothing to worry about. - Superb! Magnificent, my friend. Congratulations, congratulations everywhere! And they've not yet seen the finale, where you will surpass yourself. - The curtain's just going up. We'd better get back to our seats. - Yes, not a second to miss. Come along, quick, quick. - Bravo, got everything you want, Mr. Zinga? - Yes, thanks, Monty's looking after me all right. - No, Mr. Blane, just don't you interfere with my department. - I was only trying to- Absolutely magnificent! - All right, Monty, we'd better be getting ready. (audience murmuring) (door knocking) - Mr. Zinga, please. All right. Come on, boss, there's no need to get nervous, boss. You got plenty of time. - Come along, John, it's getting near your entrance. - All right, I'm just coming. Have I got everything, Monty? - Yes, boss. - My disk? - What is it, what is it? - My mascot. - He certainly couldn't go without that, boss. - And now, my friend. You must sing as you've never sung before. And remember, at the last cut, you will have to make a speech. - No, no, I'm no good at making speeches. - Rubbish. With the triumph that will be yours, it doesn't matter what you say, but speak, you must. And now my friend, go. Show them what you can do. Show them what Donozetti has done!

But tell me, what was that song you were trying to sing just now? - I don't really know. - Ah? - It must be, but I know what that means to those people out there. Somehow that song I was singing means as much to me. I can't understand it, but I know. (patrons chattering) - Excuse me. He appreciates your, your enthusiasm. But it's not good for him. This air, this atmosphere, is too stuffy, too hot. We have to look after him, he's delicate. Please, gentlemen. (fans murmuring) - Hello, Ruth, how are you, duchess? Aren't you proud of him? - Don't talk, well, of course she is. - Don't talk with yourself, you put that down, yeah. Blimey, they're running like a lot of rats. - Bert, I'm glad to see you. And you too, Nell. - I thought you might like to have a moment with your old friends. I'll look after these people. It's been wonderful. - What about the old docks now, John? - I often think of them, Bert. - Gentlemen to see you, boss. Sir James Pyrie, very important. Come in, sir. - Mr. Zinga, I hope I'm not intruding. My name's Pyrie. - Glad to see you. Won't you sit down? - Sir James. Come on, old girl, we better be off. - Think you're right there. - I think we better be going now, John. Good night, Ruth. - Good night, Bert. - Good night, my lordship. - I am an explorer and somewhat of an anthropologist. My reason for coming out tonight is I'm rather curious about that song you sang at the end. Where did you hear it? - I never heard it. Seems to have been born in me somehow. - Strange you should sing it tonight. It strikes a chord of memory in me somewhere. Perhaps you've heard it from your own people. You're from Africa? - No, he was born in London. - I don't know which part my people come from at all. - [Pyrie] Oh, that's extraordinary. - The only link of any kind I have is this, belonged to my father. Came to him from his grandfather. I think it's a slave talon. - Ooh, let me see, let me see. Casanga. I've got it. - You know what it is? - Yes. And it's also given me the clue to that tune. Casanga. That's it. - Casanga? - Yes. An island off the west coast of Africa. I remember it all quite clearly now. That's where I heard it. It's the King's Song, the sacred Song of Freedom of their people. I'm probably the only white man who's ever heard it. And I was very lucky to escape with my life. And you've never been there? - No, never. - My friend, this disk is the symbol of kingship in Casanga. Do you know you're probably a direct descendant of Queen Zinga? - You mean I come from Casanga? - Undoubtedly. When Queen Zinga died and her son disappeared, the witch doctors gained ascendancy over the island. They sold their trees to the unscrupulous slave traders. And ever since, the islanders suffered terrible drought because there's nothing to attract the clouds. The people still dominated by these witch doctors will never allow the white man to come near them. And so they are still backward, uncivilized, impoverished. - But if I am their king, they would let me help them, wouldn't they? - If you could prove you are their king. Heaven knows they need someone to help them in their ignorance. - Ruth, at last. I always thought we should know someday. Casanga. Our home, our people. - Wonderful, wonderful news, a big contract. New York wants you, the Metropolitan Opera House. - I'm sorry, Mr. Donozetti, I can't go. - Oh, you will have your little joke. Now, let's talk business. - But John is quite serious, Mr. Donozetti. Something's happened that makes everything different now. - Who's this? - What do you mean? My name is Pyrie. I'm afraid I brought some rather momentous news to our friend here that perhaps I'd better leave you to talk this matter over. If I can help you in any way, let me know. You have my card, yes, good night. - News? - News I've been waiting for all my life. You know, I've always wondered who my people are. At last I know. And soon, I'll be going to them. - Going to them? You mean leave me? Give up your career? Oh, but you're mad, crazy, insane. Madam, talk to him, make him see reason, I implore you. - But my husband isn't mad, Mr. Donozetti. Something bigger than his success has come to him tonight. He may come back later. But he's got to go now. - But you're joking. Tell me you're joking. - No, I'm not joking. - This is madness. Crazy! Mad! - You'll come with me, Ruth? (tribal music) (villagers chattering) (native speaking in foreign language) (tense music) Do any of you speak English? Can you understand what I say? You are my people. I have come from across the seas to be with you. I am Zinga. - Show them the disk, John. - Stranger, what do you want with us? You who call yourself Zinga. - I am no stranger. I'm of your race, your blood. And even more than that, I am your king. - Our king? You think you are a king because you come to us dressed up in a white man's clothes. - But he brings you knowledge from the great countries over the sea. It's not for himself that he wants to be king. Why, all his life, his face has been turned towards this island. There's so much he wants to do for you. - So we shall see what he can do for us. Let him come and take salt with us. Later, we shall have more of this king palava. (natives speaking in foreign language) - Come on, Monty. (tense music) (children laughing) (villagers shouting) Can we have a hut? My wife is tired. (villagers speaking in foreign language) (crowd murmurs) So this is the kingdom I've brought you to. - Don't say that, John. This is only the beginning. You'll be able to change all this in time. - I wonder. It's so difficult. Everything is so different from what I expected. It's all so primitive. - But they're your people, John. The people you've always longed for. The worse things are, the more you can help them. - You're right. It's got to be changed. It's not going to be easy, but once they accept me, we'll start work. Where is Monty? (villagers laughing) - Boss, if I wasn't here, there's one thing I'd do. - What? - Resign. And Missus, there's just one thing you were sure right about. - Well? - Yes, ma'am. When you said not to pack the boss's dress suit. - (laughing) Well, we may a swell try to make ourselves as comfortable as we can. - I don't mind being uncomfortable. It's the discomfort that's worrying me. (villagers chanting and crying) (villager speaking in foreign language) - What's the matter with him, what are they doing? - He is dead. - Dead? But he was alive, he was moving. - He has a sickness which is death, it is the same. (villager speaking in foreign language) - Wait a minute. What happens in there, what do you do for him? - He is with the others for whom nothing can be done. - You mean to say you leave him in there to die? - The hand is already upon them. - Stay here a minute, will you, Ruth? I'm going inside there. - But what's in that place? - As far as I can see, a sort of living death. (villager speaking in foreign language) (villagers moaning) (villager speaking in foreign language) Listen, Ruth, these fellows have got the fever, and they're just stuck in there without any effort to save them. We brought some quinine with us, didn't we? - Yes. - Will you go and get it? Monty, go and get some water, will you, gallons of it. Those poor devils in there haven't got anything at all. - Yes, boss. - And who are you to interfere in this matter? - Well, those men aren't dead yet. And something ought to be done for them. - This is the custom of the people! - Endobo is a wise man. And even they are beyond his medicine. - That may be. But in the country where I come from, people are saved when fever's much worse than that. And I'm going to see what I can do. - Take care, stranger. Only the spirits welcome those who enter there. - I don't want to interfere with your customs. But a lot of these lives could be saved. This hut ought to be burnt down and another one built up on the hill, away from the village. I'll see what I can do now. And later on, I'll send for some more medicine so that we can fight this fever. - [Monty] That's the best I can find, boss. They ain't got none in sanitation in this place. - We can't give them that, that would be the end. - Try and get a fire going, will you, and see if we can boil it clean. - [Monty] Yes, boss. - And give me a call when you get back. - [Monty] Yes, boss. (Endobo speaking in foreign language) - And how are things going? - Well, I did everything I could, but- - You have not eaten. - That's very kind of you. And what's your name? - I am Mandingo. - Seems we have a friend at last. 'Cause I am your friend that I'm here. - And you have come to help us? - In the only way I can. - Then you believe that he is your king? - If he be a Zinga, he is indeed a king. - But I am Zinga. That I believe, but yet the heart of Mandingo is heavy because you have come. - Should not a king come to bring help to his people? - You are a stranger to them. Although you are of our color, you are not of us. The lion that's not bred in the jungle does not know the jungle ways. - You speak truly. But I have more than jungle ways to bring to you. I have learned much from the people across the sea, their wisdom, their government, their medicine. - The medicine of Endobo is greater than that any man can teach. - That is not true, Mandingo. Have you not seen the ships that move without oars? Can Endobo make such magic? - Our people do not wish for great ships. We do not need them. - Perhaps not. But there are greater wonders than those, machines to till your land and sow your crops. I can bring them to you. And how many of your people have died from famine and disease? Does Endobo keep them alive? That's what I'm here for. Tell your people if they will accept me as their king, I will do these things and much more. - Zinga, I am your man. But while Endobo rules, there can be no king. (villagers chanting) (tribal music) - What's he doing, John? - The usual business, scaring the mind of those poor fellows with superstitious nonsense. That's what's keeping them back. What's Endobo saying? - He is saying that the spirits are angry that you've come to the island. He's telling the people they must drive you away. - Oh, is he? - Be careful, John. - I've got to put a stop to this straight away. Don't you see, honey? If they think I'm afraid, we'll never get anywhere. - Don't go into that circle. - Why not? - It is taboo. It would mean death for you. - Death. Suppose they think it means death too. Well, let them see. (villagers chanting) (tribal music) (Endobo speaking in foreign language) (villagers shouting) Now you can tell them, tell them that all this is finished. Tell them that I am their king and that I bring them a better magic, a magic which they can all learn. Tell them if they will trust me, that there is much we can do together, that we can become a great people. (Mandingo and Endobo speaking in foreign language) - So, stranger from over the sea, you claim to be our king. Therefore, you insult our gods and boast of the mighty things that you will do. There goes some of your magic. (villagers chanting) (tribal music) Yesterday, you gave them medicine and said they would live. But in the night, he died. And now, they carry him off to burial. Does all your magic end in this manner? - I did what I could for him, but I was too late. There's no need for men to die because they have fever. If the people will help me, we will do away with death huts. We will make clean places where the sick can be cured. We will take the poisons out of the water which brings these fevers. (Endobo laughs) (Endobo speaking in foreign language) (villagers laughing) (villager speaking in foreign language) - Empana speaks wisely. He says if you can do such magic with water, can you then bring us rain? - Rain? - Yes, for many moons there has been a drought in the land. Our cattle have died, and our crops do not grow. If with your wisdom you can bring rain, then perhaps the people will listen to this king palava. - I can't do that. But this I can do. If the people will put their trust in me, when the rain comes, as come it will, I can teach them how to save the rain. I will show them how to make great basins which will water their fields when the rains have gone. (villagers speaking in foreign language) - They say you are not their king, that you can do nothing but promise. - Endobo, I know you hate my husband because you feel in your heart that he is indeed a Zinga. Therefore you ask him to do what you cannot do yourself. - This is not woman's talk. We shall see, oh king who would be. Tonight, you shall look upon the power of my magic. Then shall the people show you if they want you king in Casanga. (villagers chanting) (villager shouting) - Why, Monty, what's the matter? - Have you seen a ghost? - Yes, six of them. - Come on, pull yourself together. - Boss, let's get away from here. I don't like it. It's getting on my nerves. There's something going on out there that ain't no good to nobody. - It's all right, Monty. It's nothing to get scared about. Ruth and I have just been talking it over. She's ready to stick it out with me. Aren't you, honey? - There's no turning back now, Monty. Oh, John, if we could only do something. It's this waiting and waiting that I can't stand. And those horrible tom-toms keeping on like that. They make me feel as though I want to scream. Oh, John, I'm sorry. - It's all right, honey. It's just one of their ceremonies. But I'm going to find out what it's all about. - Oh, John, do be careful. - [John] Mandingo. - Say, Mister, what's all this funny stuff going on outside? Your gentleman friends aren't cannibals, is they? It's the night of the full moon, and Endobo will leave the tribe, and they call to the gods for rain. There will be a great dance. And they will sing their sacred song. - What do they do? That I cannot speak of in front of a woman. It's the law. - Then I am going too, Mandingo. The people shall see that I respect their customs, even though I may not understand them. - You have spoken wisely. Endobo has told them that your fear will keep you away. You will stand well in the dance. Their hearts will turn towards you. It's good. - I don't like it, John. Don't go, it's a trap of some kind. Endobo means to do you some mischief. - I must go, Ruth. Don't you see this is my big chance to win them over? If they think I'm afraid, they'll never listen to me. If I don't do this, we might as well pack up and go back. And you don't want us to do that, do you? - No. All right, John, but try not to make them angry. - I'll be all right. - Boss, just a minute. - What is it, Monty? - I've been hiding this up, you'd better take it. - No, Monty, that's not the way. These are my own people, I can't shoot them down. You stay and look after Ruth. We don't need things like that. (villagers chanting) (tribal music) (Endobo speaking in foreign language) - So you dare to come to the sacred ceremony of the people. - Why should I fear, I'm not a woman. I have a right to be here. It is the law. (Endobo speaking in foreign language) (villagers shouting) - They challenge your right to be here. And they say if you're their king, prove your kingship by leading them in the dance. - Endobo, you know that I don't know your dance or this custom of the people. But you also know that this is not magic and cannot help them. Mandingo, you will speak to them for me. You will tell them that I have proof that Endobo's magic is false and that they will- - Be silent! Or I'll whither you where you stand. So you are a Zinga. And you do not know the dance. All right, then you shall learn. (Endobo speaking in foreign language) (villagers chanting) (tribal music) - It's no good, Monty. I can't stay here. - You mustn't go up the hill with them fellows. Didn't you hear what the foreman said? - I know, but I've got to see somebody. I'll go and find the women, they've been kind to me. If I stay in this place, I'll go mad. - Mad? I'm just plum crazy already. (villagers chanting) (tribal music) - Tell me what's going on up there. What's happening? (villagers chanting) (tribal music) John, John! (Endobo speaking in foreign language) - Now shall be sung the sacred song, the song that no stranger has ever heard. The King Song, the Song of Muzeah. They say if you're indeed their king, it is for you to lead them. (Endobo speaking in foreign language) (villagers chanting) (tribal music) (Ruth screams) - John!

I'm to blame, I brought her here. Come on, do something. Take this off, take this off! Let me get free. - It would be no good. You are alone. You can do nothing. - Then tell Endobo to come. I'll talk to him. I'll tell him we'll go away. (villagers chattering) - Ah, you shall come with us and see that justice is done. (Endobo speaking in foreign language) (villagers chanting) (tribal music) (Endobo speaking in foreign language) (villagers shouting) (villagers chanting) (tribal music) Now then Zinga, you're our king.
