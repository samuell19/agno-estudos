- How long you think this been empty? - How do you know? - Yeah. - Yummy, these cookies sure taste good. - What's in there? - Big loads? - Good balance. - It's a man's. - That's the first time I saw it. - Well I wouldn't think so but that's the first time it showed up like that. - So yeah every room it needs washing. - We used to have a picture. - Oh not that high. - I didn't either 'til now. - It wasn't there yesterday. - This doesn't have anything to do with it. Oh. - Yeah. - Oh. - Yeah. - Yeah, and he's working on a car. Yeah the white car. My name is Mary L. Heist. - How old are you now? - 39, 90, I have to think how old I am. 90 is right. Ronald is my oldest son. - Go on chill out, you can't get that dirty. - I couldn't either. - It's too high. - Ron was born in 1950, May 7th. And he was just a normal baby. He used to be talking, you know mama, dada, different words. And all at once he stopped. He just seemed unemotional, he just didn't connect with a lot of people. We felt bad, sad, you know 'cause he just didn't seem to take to anybody, even his own parents. He just ignored us. But we knew right from the start he liked to build things. When he was three, anything to do with building, he would do. Even if it was just blocks and things like that. Even cardboard boxes. That's the only thing that made him happy, anything to do with building. But when we got out here, it must have been 1965, he found his way. - How far underground are we? - How long did it take you to dig? - Why? - Any nails in these boards? - You got coal out of here? That, what I do, huh? - Whoa. So from age 15 to 16 you built this whole house? - Yeah. - By yourself. - Yeah. Nobody helped you? - No. - How'd you know how to build it? - Did your dad buy blocks for you? - Yeah. - And you didn't put a level on that? - No. - Never. - No never. How'd you level it? - Yeah. - That's crazy, I can't believe you never put a level on this wall. - And how long this been here? How do you do that? How do you make them last that long? - My wife doesn't particularly like to go back to Ron's place. Too claustrophobic. This topic is not something that she really likes to talk about because she feels that I got to handle most of the burden from the standpoint of not other people are stepping up and doing their part. But, I'm the closest son to Butler, it's somewhat easier for me to address these things than others. My name is Tim Heist, I'm Ron's younger brother. Ron is 12 years older than me. You know how to open these right? - Scissors. - No, just tear open the top corner, dump it on in. We shared a bedroom that actually was divided and Ron had one half, my twin brother and I had the other half. Ron used to do things and he'd blame it on Jim and I. We'd tell our mother that you know, we didn't do this but why does Dad believe him versus us. And you know her thing was, Ron's, he's just different. He was very protective of Ron, he was very supportive of Ron, and that was his top priority. It was always Ron can't do any harm. Dad was always there to help him out. He sold cars for a living, he always worked a lot of hours. It was sometimes very difficult for the rest of us because it took a lot more to get our dad's attention or let alone trying to get his time. Especially when we got to be teenagers, we went on our own and we didn't necessarily try to compete for that time. When we were young we used to think about the relationship that we'd have with our father as adults. It never worked out that way. Heavenly Father we give you thanks for this day. We give you thanks for your blessing upon each of us Lord ask this in Christ, oh Lord amen. - Amen. - Amen. - May God be with you guys. Take a little bit of everything okay. There's applesauce homemade. - Tim did you know that the kids went with Ron on a boat ride? - What type of boat? - Oh my goodness. - What white box. - Jeez. - It's a carrier for the top of the vehicle, those carriers that snap together. You put 'em on top of the vehicle. He takes them apart and you get two boats out of it. - Two what out of it? - Two boats. - That surprises me. I've been in boats before, Vera's, were I just sunk. No one really talks about Ron's situation or went to the extent of my parents sitting down with us and saying, this is how it is. Everything was more hush-hush. My dad did what he thought was right. Why else would my parents let Ron do what they did? Because they knew what made him happy. It's your first child and then they realized well something's not right here. - They called him mentally challenged, mentally challenged. He just wasn't talking. Then he didn't tell people how smart he was. - They just put that diagnosis on him, my mom and dad weren't able to question anything about that. And to me that didn't make sense. He's so capable of doing so many things. Ron's creativity is amazing, amazing. - No. - The fact that he can go to someone's house, be in there just for a little bit. Leave, go home, and draw a floor plan with windows and the way the doors swing, is just something else. I saw a movie, Rain Man. I'm like wow, that's Ron, that's my brother. He's so precise, that was always something that I picked up on growing up with him was the numbers. - What time to you tell people to call you? - Why that time? - Exact number of this, exact time it comes up. And if you stray from it, and nobody never said anything about Autism, but after watching the movie, that's truly Ron. Explain this to me. - I don't know too many people that write down everything they've done every day for the last 40 years, that's pretty good. That's pretty good bookkeeping. - You think it is? - Yeah. - The older my parents got to be they just, you know they didn't have the control over him and it's to that point to where he was accustomed to doing what he was going to do. - And what's Ron doing? - What are you going to do with it? - Which porch? - That stuff? - Yeah. - Ron can be nice in his own way, but yet his number one priority is himself. He would manipulate, lie, tell stories, and everything else to get his way. - You're going some place, tell me where it is. - Try to keep track of where he was, forget that. - Every morning it's the same routine. Expect him up here about 9:30, take one hour to eat, then he takes off and I don't see him 'til supper time. He's always doing something. - Where was that big ole bridge you had me on? It was all burned up. - Right. - I said I can't walk on that bridge no more. - My uncle is Ron's brother. My mother's sister married his brother. That's the age I was when I first met Ron. Every time we would be at a family gathering, we'd sit there and talk. That's another place where Ron tried to kill me. - This thing is literally a hundred feet in the air. On the crick. - He wanted to drive the car across it until we realized there was a big whole in the middle of it. - He'd tell me stories about all the stuff he built. Unless you see it, you almost can't believe it. First time I seen his house, I went through there and he had a maze. - There's dead ends and it's pitch black in there and it took me 45 minutes. - That was easy to do. - He would ask for cinder blocks for his Christmas list or his birthday list. Then he started building the main house, it built from there. He wanted more, so he built another building and then he connected it with tunnels. He would dig basements underneath and then connect basement to basement by tunnel. Ronald built everything by hand. He does not have big machinery, he does not have a workforce that does these things for him, he does it all himself. And some of those buildings he didn't build, he would literally find an abandoned building, and like it, and take it home with him. - How's you get this here? - Everywhere I go I tell everyone about him. And I've drugged, probably hundreds of people through his house. - You saw that? - Mm-hmm. - Where you going? - She's panicked already. - This is cool. - You know him? - No I don't, who's that? - Oh look. - Ron's right there. - He's my cousin. - Oh really? - Mm-hmm. - Ron do you know Dale Fry? - Oh yeah I know him. - That's my cousin. - Oh it is? - Yeah. - And his brother is Chris and Matt. - Mm-hmm, those are all my cousins. - Hmm. - Oh gosh, I can't wait to tell my mom. That is cool. - Dale used to live right across the railroad tracks. I don't know where Dale lives now, I don't know where any of them are living. When you see 'em tell 'em give me a call. - Okay I will. - Around six o'clock, 5:30. - Okay. - somewhere though. - I will tell 'em. - What are they signing? - How many? - 380 what? - Per year? - Yeah. When did you get these made? - What's up with the plunger? - You collect them, my gosh? - Why do you take the plunger? - The foreclosures in this area are ridiculously high. Butler has really been hard hit. You can just drive through town any given day and see a fore sale sign and it says foreclosure at the top. Years ago it was a beautiful town. People had great jobs. There was coal mines, there was Pullman-Standard, but when Pullman-Standard went out, it was like a ghost town. I mean that's where everybody worked in this area. And half the houses went empty. Just within an hour and a half drive, there's whole abandoned towns. There's all these abandoned factories and that's where Ron gets all his stuff. Some of the places he has taken me to, you can just hear them bells ringing and angels singing, it's just. I found a 1938 Wurlitzer jukebox that was rare, that is now in the Wurlitzer museum in Houston, Texas. We found a whole abandoned bar. We had antique bar lights, pool tables, and a really neat thing that we found was some memorabilia from the farmhouse that was in the original Night Of The Living Dead. A lot of the good that has happened in Ron's life is because of Chuck Heist, his dad. I said, "Chuck why did you let him do this?" He said, "Well he didn't speak until he was nine or 10. "And when we started letting him build, he opened up." - Can we get a picture Ron? You're already on our sweatshirts. - Yeah. - Okay, come on. - His house, his adventures, that is his connection with everybody. He loves being the Mole Man. Chuck just gave him that free reign to do what he wanted to do. - I can smell paint down here. - But Chuck, unfortunately within the last year he passed away. - He fell over in the bedroom. We couldn't wake him up. I said well maybe we can put him back on the bed. We just couldn't lift him up to put him back on the bed. And I said I'm gonna call the ambulance. The ambulance came, two or three weeks later he was gone. I miss Chuck a lot, yep. I'm still sleeping in that chair every night. Every since he passed away I been sleeping in that chair. I thought, I can't sleep in the bedroom, it just seems different. It's a big change, yeah. I yeah, I really miss him. I miss my car man. - You can tell just from the absence of my dad that there is a huge void in his life. - I really thought she might get really upset over it and have a reaction. - He wouldn't talk to me, I've been friends with him for most of my life. When I was at the funeral, Ron pretended like he didn't even know who I was. Somebody asked Ron who's that and he said I don't even know that name. He had let his hair grow real long, it was down past his shoulders, looked disheveled. - And he just started building constantly. - Part of the glue that holds Ron together, came apart. - Did you give any more thought about the future here? You know do we keep the house, don't we keep the house? - Not really. - Not really? All that stuff takes money, right? - Yeah. - Since my dad passed away, I inherited a huge challenge. How do we deal with the house? How do we deal with the property? How do we deal with Ron? You can't depend that life is always gonna be the same from day to day Ron. - But if something happens, what happens then? I mean you never know what's going to happen tomorrow. When our mother passes away, the situation is gonna totally change. What are you waiting on? The day to come? - You hope, we hope. If I don't do anything then we're at risk of losing everything down here. And I don't want that to happen. His routine, his environment, that's his safety zone. - To see that taken away from him is not something I wanna see, but I fear that that's exactly what's going to happen. I'm hoping not. I'm hoping that something can be figured out. - He thinks he's gonna stay there period. - I definitely would love to get my mom out of that house. You know number one, I think she feels very much a burden on herself that she has to take care of Ron. - I wish you would cook. That would be better yet. - You're a bag of pork. - It'd probably hurt him to move and do whatever, it's a big deal. - You want to be able to tell Mom that we have an answer, and we don't. - He doesn't have a way of saying well how do I afford this. Does someone else have to pay for this the rest of his life. I mean, that's something we're not prepared to do. - To see Ron pulled out of that place I think would kill him. Plain and simple, I just don't think he'd want to live anymore. And I got a quote done for my porch here and I just didn't like the number. My wife was talking about it at work and the lady she works with said, "Hey why don't you see if Ron would be interested." So he came over and wants to do it all himself, and everything, it's pretty amazing 'cause he's gonna have this thing tore up in no time. You trust me a lot with just how you can look at something and say this is how many feet long by whatever. - That's right. - Oh yeah? - No. - Ron, you gotta be kidding me. - What are you gonna play? Okay. I better put a pillow on there. Okay, hey come on now, fix that. - I'm awake. Hey that's a blue one. - Well, where was that? - Ooh look at that, got three in. Ron says I'll live to be a hundred so I don't have to worry. No, you goofed me up. - We are going to have a therapist meet Ron. - Ron's never been officially diagnosed with Autism. - He has to be diagnosed in order to get the help that he needs. Hopefully with that diagnosis, we'll have a better direction of where we need to go. - I would like to learn a lot more about Ron. And half of how we answer questions is through testing. And that's what Dr. Gastgeb's doing. - We're going to be doing all kinds of of different activities okay. And there's not always a right answer. We just need you to let me know what you think the answer is okay. - Mm-hmm. - We give the individual something to do and we try to learn about them through watching them solve problems. - Mm-hmm. - And so they're giving the opportunities to initiate and respond to conversations, and then it gives us an algorithm for scoring those behavior observations. - Now we have a book here and what's different about this book than books that you might read is it only has a few words. So we're actually gonna tell the story from pictures. So I'm gonna start so that you get an idea how to do it. Then I'm gonna let you tell me the story for a while, then I'm gonna finish the story. So Tuesday evening around eight, there was a turtle sitting on a log. And the sun came down and the moon came up and the turtle looked up and all of a sudden he saw these frogs floating all over the sky. Now I'm gonna let you tell me the story and then I'll finish at the very end. You can just tell me whatever story you want. There's no right answers to any of this. - They don't, I know. - I have an understanding, this is understanding concrete versus abstract cognitive skills. And individuals with Autism actually aren't so great at the abstract and the pretend. They're just much more concrete, black and white thinking. - Yeah, so you're gonna have to suspend disbelief. You're gonna have to pretend this is like a fiction story here. Okay so make up a story that doesn't really happen. What is in the book? What's happening on this page. - Mm-hmm. - Everybody describes him as creative, but yet when asked to pretend, to make believe, he actually wasn't able to do it. - So what's happening on this page? - So they're flying, they're having fun. - Yeah. - They don't belong there but that's okay. - Okay, I'll finish up for you. Next Tuesday something new was flying in the sky, but it was not a frog, they were pigs. - A lot of things he just wants to do what he wants to do. - Yeah. - And otherwise he just isn't interested. I said, "Why don't we go to a movie?" "I don't want to go to a movie." But when it's something about building houses or finding the way to go someplace, he's gonna do any of that. He's really good, in fact he could build a house, he could put electric in the house, that's how good he is in that. Do you want to go back there? - I would like to if he wants to invite me. And he's great with numbers and weights and measures and mechanics and his skillset because he's really fixated on those narrow interests and has learned as much as he can about that. - Wow, you're really quick. - People of his generation commonly did not get support. And I think there are many ways that his situation could not have turned out as positive as it did. Some of those people are in group homes. And he's still not out of the woods. - You've thought about the next 10 years, like your plans, your hopes, your dreams, what would you like to see happen? What would you like to do? - So pretty much what you've been doing? - Mm-hmm. - Anything else you'd like to do that you haven't done? - Okay. Most people have felt sad at some point, what makes you feel sad? - Yeah, is that a part of your life now? - Mm-hmm. - And how does it feel when you're sad? If you had to describe it. - But for Ron, his Autism also contributes some pretty amazing qualities that many people are drawn to. I have actually have never seen a collection so large as Ron's. It's positive in a sense that people find it interesting. - You know what that thing is? - It's a train signal light. - No. - I was thinking astronaut helmet, but I know that's not right either. - I think this allows him to have connections outside of his family that he wouldn't naturally have because he's not going out there and seeking them. - Yeah. - What is that? - We gotta get out of this place. - Sorry. - When you say town, you mean abandoned? - Yeah. - Okay, that's a lot of adventure. What do you say we get cracking? My name's Sean Burke, I live in Pennsylvania and I work in a steel mill. Ronald said to me, "Sean, there's a place "I want you to see and it's in the woods "and it's called Robinsville." - He said, "It's this whole town "that just was consumed by the woods." And I said, "Now this I gotta see." - Ronald knows I can't help myself and anytime there's an adventure to be had, he always ropes me into it. It's a pretty neat little area down there. - Oh yeah. - There must have been some coal mining down there. - He knows every little nook and cranny of Western Pennsylvania. - Now this, what is this road we're driving on here? - This is a driveway? - Yeah. - We're going through quad trails, downhill signs, we're in the middle of nowhere. You don't know where you are. You don't know if you were gonna find something. You have no idea. Whenever he tells you the story or what to expect, he's telling you the truth in his mind. His perception of reality and your own sometimes are two different things. We come to this valley where three creeks meet. Can't say you're wrong. - Yeah. - Up the creek valley he goes. We get to the top and sure enough, just like he said. It was a little village that was consumed by the woods. All these houses, grand old houses, a huge, huge barn, and you're thinking what happened here. Why did they leave this? Man they built this thing. This is old worldy transplant, this is outrageous. - Yeah, the whole place. - That's a lot of money in boards here. - Yeah. - Five, six, 14. - It's also not the sixth. - He knows his cars. Your dad had what? - He had a 1924 Model T, 1928 Model A. - The illustrious Piney Mansion. - And it's kind of this myth of a place. - It's hard to get to, and every year it's getting worse. - Anybody that's familiar with cars knows what a Duesenberg is, it's the creme de la creme of American classic cars. It would be worth a ton of money. Just a super charger off the Dusenberg's engine would be worth five figures at least. Is it easy to find? - No. - He has the license plates from all the cars in his place, but I have never met anybody that's been there or saw it but Ron. Where is this from? How'd you get it out? That's from Piney? - So is there anything left? - Yes. Where does Piney rank in the houses you find? - But that one's got more stuff in it than any of the others. How'd you find Piney? - And how long ago was that? - What happened to the driveway? - If it's there, we have to find it. - In going through the diagnostic criteria for Autism, it's very clear he's on the spectrum. That is what contributing to that rigidty that's been so difficult for you guys as a family. Sometimes we can help them to be more flexible, but he is not flexible. - I often said to my parents if they would hold him accountable, it would make him more functional. - It's hard not to feel frustrated with your parents because part of you is why didn't they get help, but to be honest, your mom did try to get help, and then they didn't know what else to do. And so they just sort of stopped reaching out. So in a sense it was a systemic problem I think. So, the big question is, does he stay there or not if your mother's not there? People in his generation, if you ask where are they now, some of them are just living in group homes. - That's one of the solutions, however do we really want to take him out of that environment? That's really not something that we want to do unless it actually came down to his safety or medical condition would dictate that. - My concern honestly isn't for his safety there, 'cause I feel like it's actually fairly safe for him, but my concern is about liability. - Oh yeah. - He's necessarily in danger but he's not noticing other people's safety and he's dragging people through who might get hurt and who then might actually sue. - Yes, the attorneys visited the place, looked it over and basically said someone could sue you and you could lose everything. - Yeah, I'm not sure what his monetary needs will be, but if you wait to the point where everyone feels like there's an emergency situation, it might actually be a little difficult in order to get him what he needs. So the best time to start moving forward in terms of exploring supports would be now. - We do want the best for him, but we all have our own lives and we all have our own families, so trying to continually focus on Ron, it's a huge challenge and there's no easy out. We know we're not gonna get his cooperation. We're gonna have to force it. - I live up by you. - Oh you do? - Yep, soon as I seen you walking down I said, "Oh, he wants to go through something." - Yeah. - Oh yeah. - I don't know, the guy's been dead for 25 years. - Oh, that long. - Today, I'm reaching out to an Autism expert at Yale. I'm really hoping that he has some ideas, maybe he can even give us more options than what we are aware of currently. - Given his age there's very few options the kids that were seen by doctors in the 50s and 60s, Autism existed as a diagnosis but there were no experts on it really, it was just a couple of people who originally described it and no one knew what to do with those kids. And so by in large they got institutionalized, even if they were fairly intelligent. So it was really brave to not institutionalize. - You're running out of time. - I mean in your opinion, if he is to be taken out of that environment, what do you perceive happening to him? - I think it's predictable that he would have problems adjusting because you take any 60 year old person, take all their favorite things away and put them somewhere, they're gonna lash out. Then you compound that with Autism where you have emotional problems, then yeah it's pretty cruel to do that to somebody. - Yeah we discussed that quite a bit. I mean I'm really scared of what's going to happen. There is nothing I can think of, other than trying to keep him in there, that's going to be beneficial to him. I just cannot see a positive outcome unless he's allowed to stay in that environment. - My biggest fear is that he'll lash out outside of an institution and then end up in the legal system, 'cause that's the only group that won't refuse to take him. - Right, and that's definitely not the right place for Ronald. - No, once that happens once it's just a revolving door. - I appreciate you coming on here. - Yeah, I wish I could be of more help. It's a tough situation, take care. - I don't know I'm kind of depressed now. I'm here talking to him, what options do we have here? If they wanted somebody to come in and look after Ron, state funding does not exist for that. Like he said, is he gonna end up in prison? I work at Butler Memorial Hospital in their behavioral health program. I see people from group homes all the time, they'll come in with scabies, malnourished, prison would be better than some of these places. I've seen neglected people that have bed sores down to their bone, it's just unbelievable. - They're a few good ones. - I don't see another option. I mean we have to find a way to keep him in there. It's just, what else is there? - Why do you have all the clocks back there? - Any reason why you set it up like that? - Are all the clocks on time? - No. - Barney Fife. - Have you seen that movie? - Indiana Jones, have you seen that? - No. - Do you know who Steven Spielberg is? - No. - You never heard him before this? - No. - How 'bout Brad Pitt? - You know who Michael Jordan is? - No. - LeBron James? - No. - Seinfeld? - No. - Titanic? - That movie? - Yeah. - Okay. - G-L-I-D-E. - So you try to write all of the songs in one group down? - So you don't forget 'em? - Why do you write 'em down then? - When Amanda did her evaluation, she determined Ron is Autistic. Did you or Dad ever talk about Ron's future? - No, we just seemed to go along with what was going on at that time, going to special ed. - I remember telling Dad what I thought, he didn't want to hear any of it. - Yeah that's it. - He didn't agree with those. - We should've even thought about it after he graduated from high school. - Yes. - But Ron did try to get jobs a couple of different places. But every time he'd last about one month and that was it. - You know if something had to be done tomorrow it would be basically relocating him. - You mean to live somewhere else? - You almost have to rule out the house being one of the options? - Where would he go, would he want to-- - We need to talk about, you know this house and the land and how much effort it took to maintain it and you're always trying to have to do something, fix something, repair it. You know that was Dad talking about that, let alone having Ron to try to do any of that stuff. - I know. - I mean unfortunately he created his own worse nightmare back there. - Oh you're not kidding. He just keeps on building and building. - What he has back there is a huge safety issues to begin with. - That's true. - Do you want him to stay in that? He's built structures that really don't allow anyone really to live there. Years ago my dad allowed him to run his own wire back to his house, that way he can have electricity. He built more and more structures, he runs more and more wiring through it, and he tries to heat all those places in the winter. The power bill has been over a thousand dollars a month and in fact, he's burned out the meters because he draws more than what the meter's capabilities are or capacity is. - What do you call them? - So we know there's a lot of safety issues there. You know not only is it putting his place at risk, but it's putting the main house at risk. The filth, the safety, health, all those things he's gonna put in jeopardy because he doesn't have any desire to change it. - You know it's not good for him longterm wise, but on the other hand, you know that's the environment that he has that comfort level. - Mm-hmm. - There are resources out there that can help, but he's gone have to learn how to deal with the changes that he can't say no to. How much resistance he creates, you know does he go into hiding and that type of thing? That's a whole nother issue. But he can't let his personal desire block something that is better for him longterm wise. - But yet his friends just love coming to visit him. - Yeah you know, they think all this is fun and this is a great environment you've got Ron, but that's frustrating because there's people that are going to have to make a commitment to make it work. So far, I don't think any of his friends have signed up to make that commitment. - Any one of us could move into that house, but I've got four kids, you know I've got a full time job. - I'm like you, I've got kids, I don't have the time. - All the time, it's hard to deal with. - I had thought having somebody move in to Mary's place. - Yeah. - Would be perfect, to just kind of look after Ron. Do what they did. - Yeah cook his meals. - Keep an eye on him. - I think that's a great idea. - But you're gonna have to have the finances to back it. Obviously if he lives 35 more years, you're talking a lot of money. - Yeah. - What's I'd like to see happen is some finances set up, so whoever moves in there, is gonna be able to financially cover ... - What did Tim say the plan is? - I would say a million dollars plus. - Even if it's not a Dusenberg, if the cars are in the shape that he says they're in. - Well he has plates that were last registered in the 50s for all these supposed vehicles in his place, he showed me these plates, and they look like through in good condition. He's very convincing. - He said these cars were in beautiful shape. He said you look like you can just get in them and drive them away. - This is my one possible theory. You know whenever you cross that bridge, across the Clarion River, there's a camp or some sort of a residence that the driveway has been completely consumed by grass. And if you look on your map, you'll see two buildings beside each other. And then if you look one woods line beside it, you'll see two buildings that are roughly the same size that are half consumed by the woods, but they're down in the valley. It fits the description, it's in the same location of Ronald's original map, and you just come around that hillside and you come done into the valley and you're still in the woods, but you're coming right into the back side of these two buildings. I wonder if that's what he was doing. You know there's little oil well roads up on that hillside. - They're everywhere. - And one of them tapers down and you can see it taper down through the woods and it leads right in behind those two buildings on the edge of that woods. And that's my theory is what he's talking about is right there. And the only way to find out for sure, you camo up, and you go in, and you circle around and you go and see for yourself to see if it's there. - Hi Joy. I have my entourage with me. - I see, hi I'm Joyce Cunningham, I'm the administrator here. - Tim Heist. Good to meet you. - This is our main dining area. This is where we do a lot of our activities and things also. - Yeah. - We're actually going to have a country kitchen here where we'll be serving their meals and everything right out there. The other day we started making stuffed apple cookies, they tuned into little mini pies. They love doing things like that. - All right. - I'll take you over this way. - So where did we park when we came up here the last time? - It was right here. - Right here. - To his lower road? - Yeah. - The Piney Mansion is a place that we've spent a small fortune, countless hours, trying to find. One time he took us through a tunnel that had probably caved in 50 years ago. - There's a giant mound of rubble. Ron said, "This isn't good." - Climbing over rocks in this tunnel and there's stuff falling above us you know. - I'm thinking to myself, this is absolutely crazy, what am I doing in here? We exited the tunnel and I'm like whew, I'm glad that's over. And now we're staring at a 300 yard long abandoned train bridge that's just railroad ties on rusty iron work, 300 feet off the Clarion River. I made two steps on there, and I'm looking at tree tops. - You're side-stepping across this thing. I said, "Ron there better be something good "on the other side of it." - We start walking and we get halfway across until we looking at a gap in the ties, we're down 300 feet. He walked over and he walked on that steam beam, got back on the railroad ties, and then kept on walking. So we crossed the bridge. - When we got there we found nothing. - Oh there it is. - Oh right there. - Alrighty. - If he would choose to have a private room, he would have a bed, a dresser, a nightstand, a wardrobe. And then if he's in a private room, he has his own bath. - Bath yeah. - It's a private. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. - And there's no shower. We have two shower rooms, one on each end of the hall. The TVs are included in the room, which is nice. - I'd come up three or four times with him and each time we'd go in a different way. You would think that you can't miss it. Well, you can, the woods are so dense, the pine trees are so dense. Right here is where we go off this little ridge. You can be walking through the Pine Forest and fall right off the face of this thing and not even realize it. - Holy Christ. - It's a little tricky. - We're in trouble. - Give me your hand, you got it. - We've actually found houses where the brush was so thick, that you're standing on the porch before you know there's a house there. And that's how thick it is at Piney Mansion. - Well how about he gets there and you know, like a week later he wants to leave? How do you deal with that? 'Cause that's one of our biggest concerns. He is very used to getting his own way. - This would be a big change for him. - Okay. - Each home's gonna have rules and he will have to follow them. Some people they can't do that do. If he decides not to follow the rules, the home can give him a 30 day notice. - You guys ready? - I think we wore Mike out. I'm probably just gonna sit here for a half an hour until I feel my chins. Ron says we're not even halfway there yet. - You're gonna miss that Dusenberg. - I ain't carrying it back. - Well, if you start having a heart attack, call my phone, we'll come back for you. - I don't think we can get a helicopter in here. - I kind of feel bad leaving him there but ... - We have more men here than women, by about a two to one ratio. Our average age is 59 and all of our residents carry a mental health diagnosis. - Okay. - That's the primary reason they're here. Everyone here has lived on their own and we're unsuccessful at something. Whether it be bathing, dressing, medication management, you know all of those things. - I better check on him, make sure he's still alive. - He might not have no signal. - No service. If we tried to call 9-1-1 we'd be in trouble. You hear that? - I hear it. - Those voices sound like they came from right over there on the hill. - I would say. We better keep quiet, sound travels. - I got that eerie feeling of being in someone's crosshairs. That's what's gonna happen. Told my wife that this morning. If you see the top of my head come off, you just hit the ground. - In this building here, we have two bedrooms, bathroom, bedroom, bedroom. We have 4,000 in and out. Same thing in this building. The guys that are in here are just like dug in. Not a lot of turnover. - looking for you. - How was the dentist this morning Howard? - It was good, he fixed me. - Good. - This almost looks like a driveway. I don't know. - We've got to be getting close. - I got a good feeling about this road. - You find it steep? - You guys see that structure up there? What the hell is that? We have found something. - I really wasn't sure if we were moving forward or what was happening, so. - We, yeah, I can say Ron can stay where he's at, but is it really the right thing to do. I mean just from the standpoint, it's an older home, needs a lot of maintenance and repair and it's like he doesn't want to do anything. - Right. - You know it's like you know are we really just prolonging something that we should do. - Right. - Upfront. - Okay. - What is this? - I don't know. Some kind of a workshop. It's pretty quiet in there. - This is probably a campsite, I would imagine. - A campsite. - The cabins are pretty clean. - Yeah. - I don't think anybody's been here recently, but they're definitely watched and maintained. - Yeah, Ronald's sitting up there. - You think he's spooked because of those voices? - Yeah, let me collect Ronald and we'll figure out- - I twisted my ankle. - You want to go back? - I don't think we can go back through the woods. - What about Mike? - He's probably already found his way back. The buzzards looking for us. Boy does this suck. I was really hoping to find it today. Just like Ron said it would. But being that we have been on every other inch of this entire area, this was the only spot that we hadn't been in, this was it, no Piney Mansion. Now someone's gonna have to lend us a million bucks. Oh no. - I don't know, I just don't know. I don't think Ron would make it up, but it's not here. I hope it is still up here, I really do. It's that one story that never goes away. As long as he holds on to it, then I'm going to too. - It's got to be somewhere else. - Has to be. - But we've been everywhere. You're sure it's in this plot of land. - When the warm weather comes, we'll go back again. - It's 2:11, let's get rolling. - Yeah let's head back. - Yep. - I'm- - We gave it a shot Ron. - We can do that. Now over there. - Would he have loved those cars? - Oh yes. - Gotcha. - I understand the challenge that my parents had throughout their life dealing with Ron. They did what they had to do. Once my mother passes away, I don't expect that we'll be able to support him there beyond five years. - So I am making the final decision to say you have to move, you have to transition to a different environment. - I hate the idea of him being pulled out of that place. But I don't have the power to stop it. I can't imagine going into a group home to hang out with Ron. He's probably gonna be withdrawn, he's not gonna talk, and if he does talk, what's he gonna talk about? Memories, 'cause that's all he have at that point. - I wish I could give Mom a solid plan. She wants to know that he's going to be okay. - Take one day at a time and hope for the best. That's what I always say. - There's no happy ending. No, it is what it is. - Ronald is a survivor. He can't not be a survivor, he'll find a way. - What stories would I tell people. I wouldn't have 'em. He's literally one of God's masterpieces. Why would you want him to conform when it's his nonconformity that makes him who he is? - Where we going today Ron?
