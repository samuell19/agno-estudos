Hey! Why did the Paris Express stop here? Well, probably waiting for the crossing of the train from Lyon. May I get a cappuccino? - Right away. Oh! Your train! How much? - Never mind. Go, don't lose it. Please, make yourself at home. It's quiet and the food is good. Many say it's the best in St Etienne. - Certainly. The best in the city. If you want to eat here, bring a rabbit's foot! Meow, meow! I'll sue you, Mr Bussy, if you keep singing that song! Excuse me, old boy, the song is everywhere due to Zaz?. This gentleman lost his train? Now he can get to know this city. Going to Paris? Luigi, Pernod! - Please, sit. May I offer you my table? If you don't mind my company. If I may: Bussy. You better accept. They show me, Bussy, every attention. They're afraid of my reprisals. I've a weapon: publicity, the god of this century! Martino, get to work, we've a guest tonight. Bon appetit! Thank you. - Give it to me. There. A metaphorical guest, you mean. - No! Not metaphorical. We made you lose your train. We people of St Etienne. We must make amends. I couldn't accept. - No? Then... Then I'll be your guest! It's right after all that I, Bussy, offer you my company! I'd be very glad. - Hey, waiter! Do you like Chablis? Yes, as table wine. Table wine... Bring a bottle. - A bit more, more. That's it. Good. Are you a journalist? I used to be. I was indeed. A journalist. One who even had a certain renown. And you? Engineer. Electrical engineer. I was a journalist but now I'm a poet. I write for the Alhambra company, Albert. Maybe the word "poet" is a bit strong. I write, write verses, couplets, madrigals by Bussy. The public learns them because of local current events. A variety show, you see. People go nuts over them. Why do you smile? I smile because I think it must be difficult to find topics. What ever happens in the provinces? - What? Oh, Mr... Mr... Mr... Mr? - Dufresne. Dear Dufresne, you don't get it! The provinces aren't what you Parisians imagine. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. You can eat in peace. I can't. I need to write an eulogy on the provinces. Me: Bussy! This would be a good idea for a revue number. I really need to write it. Am I clear? Because in the provinces there's passion, curiosity and rumors. Intense emotions because there are no other distractions. Understand? Great love is born in the provinces. Mme Bovary for example. And great crimes. I bet in Paris there's not a woman who's turned so many heads like Zaz?. Who is Zaz?? Damn, I'm late and the show has started. Zaz?? Zaz? is the one who sings the couplets of Bussy! You mustn't leave without hearing her. Come to the Alhambra. If I came, it'd be only to hear the couplets of Bussy! You'd be wrong because the couplets of Bussy, owe all their merit to Zaz?! You coming? - My train leaves at 12:30. It'll be done by midnight. Remember me. Ask for me: Bussy! I must confess, I really don't like caf? concerts. Alhambra, the third on the left. How else will you pass the night? It's only a few hours. I'll find a way. Waiter, the bill. My heart with love does thrash for your emperor's mustache. If you wait me for in your coup?, after the show you can steal me away. Here there's a telescope, I own, to look at me, me and me alone. But there's a man out of fear or shame pretends naughty things to disclaim. Handsome man with eyes of blue, on the floor don't look askew. My simpers, my charms are all for you. Stop being a fool and look at me too! My heart with love does thrash for your emperor's mustache. If you wait me for in your coup?, after the show you can steal me away. Cascard! Cascard! What is it? - She's late again, eh? Hey! Good evening! Finally, took the bait, eh? Go, dear, you're up. After this number, dear. Oh! Well? What do you think? Is that Zaz?? You can steal me away with your coup?. No! She's never on time! They're fighting. - I noticed. The fat guy is the impresario, the other one is Zaz?'s partner. I'm losing my patience! You and your Mme Zaz?! I don't want to know anything! We'll begin all the same! It's always the same story: Zaz?'s always late. Always! - Why? Why? Because her name is Zaz?! We can't start. - We're starting anyway. Without Zaz?? - Without Zaz?! Who's the boss? Me or you? Or Zaz?? What will they do? - Go on without her but let's see how the public likes it! Malardot, we're starting? I'd like a vermouth. - Fine, we'll start! It's very chic, it's very bon-ton to spend a night at the singing caf?! An offer of champagne and a song and the intoxicating steps of the can-can! It's very chic, it's very bon-ton to spend a night at the singing caf?! An offer of champagne and a song and the intoxicating steps of the can-can! What a fine locale! You were right. Waiter, two drinks! As long as management is paying. Where's Zaz?? I haven't seen her. Not here. - What will we do? - Let's hope she comes. Variety! There are still verses to say. Let's hope she arrives in time. Say them slowly. - Easy to say. Variety! What a lovely thing! There's the diva, the star, the lovely dancer, daughter of Cilice. There is the trained seal, a devilish ingenue, a flower of grace and beauty! Long live, long live the Variety! Funny, eh? To be sure. I've got indigestion. When will she come? I wonder what she's doing. Variety! A dazzling heaven! How many stars but among them is the most beautiful of all! Zaz? is capable of not coming and blowing up the number. Electrifying! Alluring! Amazing! We're in trouble... Her name everybody knows! There seems to be something wrong. What's going on? - Say something. Keep playing the music. Play! Stunning! Flaming! Ah, there she is! Unnerving! In an instant, she comes! There she is! It's her! Who is she? - Zaz?! Listen, Zaz?... - Give this to Natalie. Give this to Natalie! Zaz?... Give me my gloves. - Go on, Zaz?, you're up! Zaz?, your number, hurry! - The feather boa! No, not that. Music, Maestro. Zaz? isn't pretty. No, she's not pretty! But it doesn't matter a fig. No, not a fig! But wherever she goes, wherever that may be, the people look at her. Her alone they see! And tru tra la la, they look at Zaz?, because Zaz? has je ne sais quoi! Honestly, this je ne sais quoi, is something that only has Zaz?! And tru tra la la, they look at Zaz?, because Zaz? has je ne sais quoi! Honestly, this je ne sais quoi, is something that only has Zaz?! Have you ever seen the like? No. Never. The spectator when abed, tries to strain his head. That je ne sais quoi that people like, it torments him and teases. His wife her patience ended, becomes offended but his face while asleep, a sweet smile does keep! And tru la la, he dreams eyes shut Zaz? has a certain I don't know what. Honestly, this je ne sais quoi, is something that only has Zaz?! And tru tra la la, they look at Zaz?, because Zaz? has je ne sais quoi! Honestly, this je ne sais quoi, is something that only has Zaz?! They sing along? - Yeah. For Zaz?, they sing along. Who knows if it exists and in what it consists this je ne sais quoi hidden in some place forbidden. It'd make an honest lady start acting shady. And virtue the most chaste will want a taste! My train leaves at 12:30. - Then, goodbye. If you ever return, remember Bussy! - Thanks. ...because Zaz? has je ne sais quoi! Honestly, this je ne sais quoi, is something that only has Zaz?! One moment! One moment! Music, Maestro! Music! Have you seen a glove? Have you seen a glove? Have you seen a glove? Have you seen a glove? No. I mean, yes. And virtue the most chaste will want a taste! And tru tra la la, they all say, Zaz? has je ne sais quoi all the way! Honestly, this je ne sais quoi, is something that only has Zaz?! And tru tra la la, they all say, Zaz? has je ne sais quoi all the way! Honestly, this je ne sais quoi, is something that only has Zaz?! Good evening, dear Zaz?! You've sung divinely. Not this way. Let's walk over here. Listen, if you keep coming late, they'll make a complaint. Ah, Cascard! You and I understand each other, no? Say, has the Marseille contract come? - Not yet. I don't know why. You sang like a nightingale! A real nightingale! Listen, Zaz?, late again and I'm fed up! Next time, I'll come early. Don't yell so, you make me nervous and it'll only make me more late. Look. I didn't even have time to put on my makeup. I'm only saying, dear, don't blow off poor De Buysson. He's paying for half the show. - Really? Good. I'll blow him off for the half he's not paying. Let Floriana have him. She has the stomach for that morsel! Zaz?! Late again? How about a number with Floriana? Floriana badmouthed Cascard. And Cascard's my friend. I won't! Right, my Cascard? Hey, she takes care of you, eh? - Does that annoy you? I don't want him badmouthed. It was he who got me into the cafe. And bought me dresses when I was beginning. Let's go, Floriana! You're up! - Floriana, hey! You're up. Let's go! Dear De Buysson! Let's go, little one. "Dear De Buysson, let's go, dear De Buysson!" Zaz?, shut up! You knows he pays for half of this. - Hooray. Natalie? Where are you? Where are you off to now? Not even time to put on my makeup. I came to give you this glove which... you lost in the foyer. Excuse me. - Hey! Why didn't you ask Bussy to give it to me? Bussy? Why Bussy? You came with him at the back of the room, when I arrived. Or am I wrong? How could you notice me? You came running in. Dunno. But... One moment. Wait here. It's really her. Wait, OK? Is that Floriana? - Yes, She had an encore? - Yes. Get out of the way, beast! Hey, Simone? Floriana had an encore? - Yes, the number with the oranges. One encore. Who knows how much that will cost poor De Buysson. Paid for? You're saying that... De Buysson paid for it? Hey! Listen, Zaz?. Who's in your room? A conquest. If you heard what they said about Floriana... Where is he? Excuse me... - It's late, we're closing. Fine. Nobody is around at this time. But there's time before the train arrives. Yes, I know there's time. - Evening. Evening. Zaz?! Sit down. Give me the flowers. - Yes. Bussy, listen. Tonight, when I entered into the hall... - Yes? You saw that I was late. You were in the back near the door. Remember? - Oh, yes. And by your side was a man who... - Baby! Oh, Mama, what do you want? - You know the rent is due. Yes, I know the rent is due and I must pay the landlord. I know! I could get it and pay him myself. You're good at getting it but not so much paying it! No, listen Zaz?. I have a little debt: only 30 francs. 15! - 30! Listen, I'm giving you 20 and no more. Natalie, my purse. C'mon, Zaz?, gimme 30. - 20! Gimme 30. - 20! 30 and I'll tell your fortune! Today is Friday, a lucky day. If you're curious to know something. - Yes, there is something! Zaz?, would you like to know anything? - Get me the cards. Zaz?! Cut them with your left hand. There. King of Clubs, a man! - A man? De Buysson? - No! A young man. Tall... - It's me. Fair haired. - Not me. Fair haired? - With blue eyes. - Blue? Natalie, my gloves. - Spades! Beware! Beware? Of what? Zaz?, you're up! - Come on, Zaz?, you're up. Let's go! Mama? Is it another woman? No! Beware of losing a lot of money. You're right, my girl! With all your lovers, there's always money! Mama, what do I care about money? Well done, Mommy! The cards were good. How much will you give me, dear? - Give her 50 francs. Bussy, come. - Yes, dear. Let's go. You're up! I want to know something, Bussy. - Zaz?! Zaz?! Bussy, you must do me a favor. You must bring your friend. The King of Clubs! Hey, Zaz?, hey! What friend? I saw that there was a lady which you hid: the Queen of Hearts! If I didn't, bye-bye 50 francs! The one who came with you. - Why? You know him? You're up! Gimme my fan, powders, tassels, mirror, everything. Hey, let's go with the fan! Gimme. Everybody, let's go! Watch out for the curtain. Bussy! Bussy, come here! What? - Where is he? - He left. He had to catch the 12:30 train. The curtain! He left? Idiot. Today, I'm in a good mood. I want to laugh and joke. If you're in love, dude, and feel your heart is broke better to forget about that and to live and enjoy. Come to the place of song and with Zaz? sing along. Oh, look at him in the front row, with his shining bald head. A happy rosy cheeked beau, our veterinarian aforesaid. If only all the pumpkins shine like him would do, they would give light to day and be like the revue! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Oh, that lovely grandpa, who after much time, sits coolly in his britches, with his glass of wine. Perhaps, losing his hair, celibacy he contemplates, but seeing Zaz?'s form and flair, he runs back again straight! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Hey! At my ankles, you do stare, whirling round and round. And you want to discover where my Netherlands can be found. I want to give you one inch more, but if you get dizzy, look down on the floor! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Ah, finally, a young man, with a little bit of education. He stares at my hands, such a nice formation! Maybe some caresses, happy dreams will make and that's such a little thing, I can do for goodness sake! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! I really have fun with this subject. Laughing at everyone, looking for defects. I have a weakness too, which I cannot hide. But while my heart is young, I'll laugh, taking it in stride! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Sing with me! Leave thought behind. At the revue, you must unwind! Zaz?! Zaz?! It's impossible she's not here! She rehearses at 11 and it's still 9! I tell you she's not there! - What do you mean she's not? Is there anybody there? - Nobody's there, Ma'am! She left! - Let me see. There's people. Excuse me. - Now are you satisfied? What are you doing? Trying to get dressed. There we go. Why are you getting up? Didn't you see my note? Didn't you see it? But you... want to leave. Without waiting for me, like a thief. Like a thief? Leave the 100 francs on the table. - Oh, please! Sorry, I just woke up. I just saw this room. Then the door opened. A woman came in. I think it was your mother. In short, It's better that I go. It's better that you go. Right. No, Zaz?, you don't understand. Oh, I understand well enough. No, you don't understand. You don't! I must explain. I was scared from the beginning. I knew it was a thing, we couldn't fly from. I wanted to leave because I... - Because you...? But I couldn't. And then it felt like a terrible fever I had to get rid of. How could a heart reason so? And now I want to go because I love you. And I'm afraid. Afraid of something so simple? You love me truly? Then you were right. It's better we part because if one day you didn't love me anymore, I would kill you. Let's part. Just like this: smiling. I don't want you to have a sad memory of Zaz?. It's a little messy here. You must leave, get dressed. Wait, I'll look for... Here's a robe. - But... Why do you dress me like that? Those are clothes for an outing. Right. I'd like an outing. Just think, I could never go because of my damn profession. I rise late, rehearse in the afternoon and I'm on the stage on Sundays. Put this on. But you forgot your bags and have nothing. Aren't you going to rehearse? - Ah, the belt, as always! Today, I left early so I could talk to Malardot. He refused! He became very angry and I broke my contract. What? You broke your contract to go out with me? What's so strange about that? Go, look for a comb and brush. Natalie! Hot and cold water in a bath! Get dressed. It's getting late, no? Will you remember me? Or will you forget me as soon as you leave here? Even if I wanted to, I could never forget you. I will remember you like a madness. A sweet but terrible madness. I will remember you like a... like a... I don't know what like. Forever. That's it. Goodbye, Albert. Zaz?... Zaz?! It's good. Dear, excuse me for a moment. I'll be right back. Zaz?! What happened? They're saying you won't perform. Malardot is furious! Natalie wouldn't let me in. - Come in. Why? - Come! What is it? It is... Your conquest from last night! I should be jealous and not say what I've got in my pocket for you. Cascard, tell me what... Say, what is it? - When you're in trouble, I always fix things. But luckily this time, your fight this morning brought good luck. What is it? - The contract! Genou's Marseilles contract is here! 20 francs a day! And our names first on the posters. Now we can whistle at all the Malardots of the world. Didn't I do well? Yes... Yes, but... What's the matter, Zaz?? Aren't you pleased? I am but... I would have to go to Marseilles. - What is this? What does that mean? Mean? It means I don't want to go to Marseilles! Can I do what like? Yes or no? Or is it no? You can ruin your career, if you want. - My career! I don't give a fig about my career! - Zaz?! Forgive me. Zaz?? Is this thing so serious? Yes. And him? He's leaving tonight. But he'll come back maybe. Maybe? Maybe. You see, that's why I can't go to Marseilles. I see. If he returns. "Maybe." OK, we just need to talk to Malardot and declare peace. Ask his pardon. Too bad, because in anticipation of leaving, I told him off. I'll have to ask pardon too. Oh, well. Poor Cascard. - Yes, but what will we say to Ginou? Nothing. We'll ask for 30 francs a day. And if he agrees? - We'll ask for 40. So you're kicking me out, eh? - I've so little time. He leaves in an hour. - And he'll return maybe. Oh, Cascard... This never happened to me before. You're an idiot! It was a superb contract. Oh, well! Who knows but maybe you're right. Anyhow, I'll come by tomorrow, eh? Ah, you're here. Where were you? Out there. Oh, nowhere. Thanks. - What's the matter? Nothing. Just looking. That peaceful home. Those children. Sometimes, I envy them. An everyday life would bore you. Besides, it's hard imagining a normal life with you. Is that a reproach? Yes... No! I mean I don't know. I only know one thing: I hate disorder. But what attracts me to you... is the disorder itself. Then I'm happy! But you must leave. Excuse me. Natalie, the luggage! You don't have luggage! One more kiss because one can't at the station with so many people. You still love me? Take this. What is it? A key to my house for when you return. Because you will return, won't you? I'll return. You'll come back? When? I'll come back. Albert! When will you come back? Albert! Julie! Tot?! Antonio! Antonio! You're here, Sir? - My lady is not here? No, she's not here. She expected you yesterday and the day before. They had to leave for their vacation at Vichy, like the years before and they were hoping that you'd go with them. That's right. How could I forget it? They postponed their trip, something that was never done before. Then a courier arrived. Mrs Anna, her grandmother, wasn't well. Anything serious? - No. But Ma'am thought... - So she left? She was very uncertain. I sent you a telegram at Chambery. I hope you received it. - No, I didn't. She left yesterday with the girl and the governess. Thank you, Antonio. Oh, Antonio, how is the girl? - Well, Sir. Did you have a good trip, Sir? No. Prepare breakfast, please. That's him. Go open it. It's him! How could it be? You gave him the key, no? Hurry, fly! Albert! Boss! Come on, let's go! Come on! What are you doing? Here, take the rope! Hey, pull the rope! One can't practice this way! And we gotta perform tonight! Go on, hit your hammer! We have to put up the scenery. - The scenery! Mr Malardot! What is it? Either we rehearse or put up the scenery! - No airs! We're putting up the scenery! Put up the scenery! Continue! Stop with that rope! See? Is it possible to find artistic inspiration with all this? Yes, rehearse, put up the scenery. Do what you want! And that's how he thinks we make art! You, be more quiet, eh? Got it? Let's go. Go on. L'?toile Frou Frou...... - Bye, gorgeous! Hi, Pierre! What are you doing? Your accounts? People aren't drinking. They'll stop at nothing not to consume anything inside. And the new waiters serve beer without foam! Hey, Malardot, you old madman! What are you yelling about? Zaz?! What are you doing? You're early. You rehearse at 11. No, no, I'm neither early nor late. Bussy! How are you, Bussy? You OK? Look, I brought you a song. - Don't you like it? Yes, it's nice but give it to Floriana. - Zaz?, this time, you're wrong. I heard her. She's great! A success! That's why I don't want to deprive her of it. Here! Bye, Bussy dear. - Why bye? I'm off! - Going? - Malardot, I'm off! You're off? - One day. Just one day. Bye, Bussy! Zaz?, you'll ruin yourself with that Dufresne! This nonsense has been going on for a month! - Ah, a month! But what a month! - You'll surely ruin yourself! Zaz?! Nice scenery, eh? - What are you doing here? You didn't invite me to Paris, so I had a friend invite me. Why look at me like that? My friend is nice, you see. Dark, blue eyes: He looks a bit like you. My bag. You see, I have two days vacation. I got two days out of Malardot. I was so happy, I started singing! Zaz?... - We must lower the curtain. Why didn't you tell me you wanted to come to Paris? Because I thought that you would have said no. You see I thought the letter... was a lie. That you have somebody in Paris. No, I have nobody in Paris. You see, I didn't invite you because in my home... I know why I couldn't come: because of your mother. - I know a hotel in Montparnasse! I lived there when I was a student and I know the owners. Oh, look who's here! Albert! Our dear Mr Albert! Mr Dufresne, you mean! Can't you see he's a gentleman? - But it's him! Really him! How many years have passed? - Many. 7 years. You were very young. - But he hasn't changed at all! Not at all! Mrs Ernestina, you've changed a lot. - You're not nice. Let me finish: You look so young, I thought you your daughter. Always making jokes! And how do you find my Leon? He's still on the ball and worthy of his name! That's a good one! 7 years and you haven't changed at all. Eh, there's been a change by Jove! Have you been married long? Married? Us? No. Not long. Then you're on your honeymoon, Ma'am? Yes, exactly. Yes. - Then, the room with the balcony. It's number 24. Excuse me. Mr... and Mrs Dufresne. What fine sun! The room Mr Albert had before was always full of sun all day long. Right. - Yes, right. Right. That's the courtyard. It's more quiet. Excuse me. Ah, no, dear. We'll take off our shoes tonight. Go do your business and read your mail. Put on your hat. And afterwards will be all ours. Only we two. Councillor, a speech! - What speech? The newlyweds! The newlyweds! They're they are! Silence! Congratulations to the newlyweds with a sincere heart, pleasure and delight! You too, Ma'am! You must toast the newlyweds! Ma'am! Champagne! Champagne! Right away! Come, fill it up! A toast! A toast! Let's hear a toast! - Come, a toast! Quiet! Well, I... I hope you'll be happy. That you'll be happy forever. Because... eh, because... only in feeling oneself happy... is the true felicity. Long live the newlyweds! Leave it, Antonio. Hello! Is there mail? Here, Sir. Construction site in Chartres. Construction site in Chartres. The shareholder's meeting... Is today the 18th? - Yes, Sir, it is. Nothing from Vichy. Strange, they always return by the end of the month. Did my lady not write? Well, truly, my lady... - Albert! Albert, you're here! Zaz?! Zaz?! Ah, you're here. Finally! What's wrong? What's wrong? - Oh, Zaz?... You waited for me all day and night. And you never reproach me. Is that all? Yes, I should reproach you. But now you're here. Tell me, what happened? Pardon me. I don't know how to tell you. But you must leave immediately. Me? Why? We can meet again the day after. - What happened? Listen, my dear, If you want us to be happy, don't ask me any questions. I'll explain it later. I can't now. Our happiness depends on it. All right. As you wish. There's another woman. Tell me, I want you to. Go on. No. No? Will you swear? Zaz?, I swear that... between me and you, there could never be another woman. Even if I had to choose between my life and you, I'd choose you. Why do you look at me like that? You think I don't know what I'm doing? Do you trust me? Yes. You believe me? Yes. Yes. Maybe it'd be better if I say... - Say no more, I believe you. Well, then. I'm going. We'll meet up the day after. And we'll never separate again. After tomorrow... Wednesday the 19th, Thursday the 20th, Friday the 21st. He... comes... back. Friday... The fountains murmurs, "Floo, floo, floo!" There returns a palpitation, a palpitation of youth. 20 years old, I laugh from my heart. - Mama! Mama and Cascard! You two together? What a surprise! And without killing each other? If I knew earlier, I would've been worried! Why not? Two well mannered people can disagree without coming to blows. Say, where did you come from? - Aren't you tired, Zaz?? If you want to change, go on. We'll wait. No, I'm not tired but I will change. What were you playing? Floriana's song. - The song you wanted to give to Floriana. Why don't you like it? It's not bad at all. Bad? It's a darling! And how you play it! Play it! Play it! You play it deliciously! It's been a while since you've been here, Cascard. My daughter is right. 20 years old, I laugh from my heart. Ah, love! Ah, love! Ah, love, which gives me... Why are you laughing? I'm laughing... at the nice idyll, you're having together. Go on. - Laughing at one parents is bad! No, Mommy, dear. Come here. Sit. I've something nice for you. - Not too strong or it'll get sick. Oh, no. It's only grappa. - I'm not used to it. You want some too? Why not? Now then, Zaz?, this number... Malardot this time insists. You've gone too far. - Way too far. But it's just one night more. In the last 15 days, you've had a headache half the time. What headache! You didn't let anyone come but we all know you want to be with him... Mama, stop it! I'll do what I want. I didn't want you here to put me through this! And as for this: I'm not singing it! And tell Malardot, I don't need him or anybody! If he gets mad, I'll get madder and leave him. - Bravo! I expected nothing less from you, my girl! If you fight with Malardot, great! We'll call him. - Ginou in Marseilles. I followed your advice: He'll pay us 30 francs a day. A golden opportunity: You could give me a small stipend regularly! Zaz?, this time he can't refuse you. Is that true? - How could you know? Here's the contract. Take it. Doesn't this seem rather bad, Cascard? If that's all it takes to make peace with him. I won't sing. - But... What? You refuse someone who'll double your pay? How ungrateful these children are! She's refusing! She turns it down! Down! And why? And for whom? Because of that cheapskate, you threw us out... - Shut up! Leave us together. - I'm counting on you, OK? How ungrateful children are! It is true that you're ruining your career. And mine too but that doesn't matter. I'm looking out for you since now you won't for yourself. I am looking out for myself, Cascard. I'm doing it for the first time in my life. No, you're not, Zaz?. I mean, seriously. You've given up everything. Burning all your bridges. The years are coming on. And when this... love ends... - Why must it end? Because it can't go on your whole life. No love does. What do you know about love? Once, you could never ask me that. - Please, Cascard. You couldn't call it love what we had between us. Maybe, I felt something similar for you. You? We were good friends. Nothing more. Besides, when I was with you, you weren't the only one. You knew and never said a word. You call that love? I never had the poor taste to be jealous. That's all I would've needed! After all, it wouldn't have suited you to be. You don't know what love is. It's like... It's like a blind man not knowing what colors are. You know what made you talk so? Because I loved you. - Oh, no. Out of vanity. Deep down, a man never likes to be replaced by another. Now, you exaggerate. You're not jealous but you are vain. And you're looking after me! And if I told you that Dufresne had another woman? What? I said, if he had. What do you mean? - Mean? What if he had another woman. Would you begin, at least, to doubt his love? What? Just saying. What are you telling me? What is this about another lady? What is this about another lady? Speak! Don't play! Answer. Who is she? You know nothing! You did it to poison me, to drive me away from him. To get me to sign your damn contract! Liar! I really didn't want to tell you. - What? But sooner or later, you'll find out. - What? That he has a relationship in Paris. Him? - Him. Liar! Get out! Get out of my house! Get out, I say! You said a woman? Who is she? Speak! Don't leave me like this. Finish what you begun. Yesterday, I was in Paris. - So was I. With him! Even at night? You saw him at night? At the revue. At the revue? And afterward? It's plain. While going to contract the trained dogs, I saw him coming out. A lady of class, very beautiful, blonde, elegant. She could've been his sister. - Rather, I'd say his lover. You think I'm so naive, that I don't understand certain things? You said that... she was beautiful. Very beautiful. Blonde? - With large blue eyes. At the revue. While I waited for him. While at the hotel, I waited alone. Zaz?, come, don't cry. A guy like that isn't worth it. I'm not crying! I'm not crying! What happened? What's the matter, my girl? Tell me, my girl! Who did this, Cascard? Leave her. - You leave her, wretch! My poor daughter to cry so! What is it, dear? He has a lover! - Who? Cascard? Yes, Cascard! - Dufresne. A lover? Really? Really? Tell me who it is? Last night, I saw him at the revue with a lady. After, they went to get a chocolate. - A chocolate! Coward! - Scoundrel! You must get rid of him right away. Don't even let him see you. Right, Cascard? Now, we'll sign the contract for Marseilles. Soon, we three will be on a train far from here and forever, eh? Natalie! Natalie! - What do you want to do? Natalie! Natalie! Is my luggage there? - Yes, Ma'am. Help me change. I'm going to Paris to see him. Him? - Him. - Him? - Him! Yes. Oh, the coward! - Ma'am, the luggage. Coward! Put it here. I'll give it to him. Waiting in that room the whole night alone! You don't do that. And him with a woman! - My luggage! I'm going with you. With me? Please! And then he brought her to the revue. He should have brought me to the revue, not her! So he took her for a chocolate! Some story! Took her for a chocolate! I'm too nice! I'm too nice but when I get... That's why he looked like that when he came in! My stocking, Natalie. That's why, oh, yes! He felt guilty. "You must go, you must go." And I believed him! You understand? Stupid! Stupid as I was! Oh, Cascard, you were right! You were! Love doesn't last! Natalie, come with me. Me, Ma'am? - Get dressed! My daughter! Cascard, tell me, do you understand her? You do? Lucky you! I don't. To me, she's crazy. A poor madwoman. Ah, my poor girl! Mama! - What? - Mama! Get my broach! - Yes, dear, I will. Ah, yes, my dear, now you'll have to choose. Me or your fine lady! - And if he chooses her? No, he won't choose her. It's probably an old relationship. I can't fasten these. Get my coat. Yes, but I know those kind of women. The finer they are, the more you have to pay! But I know what to do! - Do you have the address? My God, what's the address? Once, I saw him take an envelope out of his pocket. It must be here. Yes, it is! Natalie, my hat. My gloves. My purse! My fan! Hurry, Natalie! This time, he'll hear me! He'll listen to me now. Give me my hat. Right. Give me my purse. Mama! Goodbye now. Cascard. Look after the house, Mama. I'll be back tomorrow morning! Oh, Cascard, take a look at me. Do I look good? - Yes, you do. I must impress her. One look at me and she'll see that it's all over! Got it? It will make an impression on her and on him also, eh? Are you sure, he'll appreciate this visit? Appreciate? And how he'll appreciate it! And that woman's going to hear from me! I'll give her a chocolate! Is the lady of the house home? Your mistress, you understand? Whom should I announce? - Natalie, come in! My lady has gone out! - Ah, gone out! Fine, I'll wait for her. This way, right? I don't know if I should... - Oh, you should! Natalie, close the door. Let her know when your lady returns. Whom must I announce? Oh, it doesn't matter. Your lady and I are old acquaintances. This will be a fine surprise for her. You may go. Oh, say! Is the master at home? - No, Ma'am. Oh, no? Good. How long have you been here? - One year. Just one year. Just one year? Hey, tell me, the master lives here, right? - Excuse me? I mean that they live together. - I don't understand. Doesn't he eat here? Sleep here? - Naturally. Thank you. Let the lady know when she returns. She'll learn how a real lady behaves! - And if they kick us out? Who? Me? Don't make me laugh! You'll see when she returns. And if she returns with him? - Him who? Albert? All the better. Come on, go in. Don't be scared. Go in. Some house, he put her in! Truly, a lovely house. And what furniture! Nicer than ours, eh? Imagine that sofa in our living room! - Look at that mirror! But you don't understand these things. Look at those flowers... And this? This is all real silver. - And all spotless. I don't know how they keep it so clean! - With a cloth and wax! By getting their hands warm, something you'd never do, cow! Sit! You say that to me? - Yes, you! You clean, don't you? But Ma'am, if Mr Albert left you, it's not my fault! Left? Me? Left me? You can't just keep a man with order and cleanliness! That's something for women who don't have any other points. Probably like her. Before I came here, I was a bit afraid to see her. But now... I want to see her. I really want to see her! Oh! Hello. Are you waiting for mama? Mama? Come, sit here. What's your name? Antoniette. But at home, they call me Tot?. Antoniette what? Dufresne. Your mama? What's her name? - Juliette. Her last name? What is it? Tell Ma'am, go on. I don't need to ask: Dufresne. Of course. All ladies are called so from their husbands. Like you, right? Oh, me... I don't have a husband. Then why are you called "Ma'am?" Because... Because I'm a widow. Would you like to see a nice book my daddy gave me as a gift? Shall I bring it? You heard what she said? "My daddy." Ma'am... Look at this book here which my daddy gave me when we came back. How nice it is! Came back? Did you come back with your mama? - Yes. I came back with mama from Vichy. We always go to Vichy in summer. But this year, Papa couldn't come. And why wasn't he able to come this year with you? Mama said it was because of business. A shame, wasn't it? Yes. Certainly. I love my daddy very much. People say I look a lot like him. Oh, yes! Why? Do you know him? Oh, no, but you said it: Everybody says so, right? Does your daughter look like you? I have no daughters. Never had. No? I would've liked to have them. I would've loved them so... - Let's go, Ma'am. If you're good too, even you could have a little girl. Is your mama good? See here. This is the story of a queen who was good. The fairies gave her a baby. On the other hand, the other queen who was bad, Was it her fault she was bad? That's how the story goes. Yes. That's how the story goes. - Ma'am... Let me see this gift your daddy gave you. He spoils you, eh? Oh, yes. Mama always says so. When you were a girl, did your daddy spoil you too? I never had a daddy. But you had a mama? Yes. And she loved you? Of course. Like my mama does me? Maybe it was so. No... Mama was always away. And when she came home... She gave you lots of kisses? Oh, no! She wouldn't kiss me... so as not to wake me up. And maybe, it was better I slept. You see, Tot?, there are people... who are very misfortunate. So misfortunate as a child, that later they become bad. Is it their fault? Children who don't have food, right? There are some... who need more than bread. Those who don't have daddies then? - Yes. And that is the greatest misfortune that can befall them. I know. I'm very bored when daddy isn't here. My dear! You won't be sad anymore, Tot?. You won't. It will never happen again. Oh, you're crying? Why? Oh, it's nothing! But you came to practice, didn't you? Will you let me hear you play? Really? - Yes, dear, go on. It's a difficult piece. I don't know it so well yet. Oh, Natalie, it's over. It's over. Mama! Mama! What will you do? Mama! A lady has been looking for you. She's waiting for you. A lady? The lady presented herself. Mrs Dufresne? Honestly, I was looking for a different Mrs Dufresne, who lived in the same street. It was a mistake. Your daughter made me realize it. She's very precious. You must be happy, Ma'am, you and... her father. May I give her a kiss? Thank you. Goodbye, Tot?. - See you soon, Ma'am. What if Zaz? comes back now? Some man! You wait for her, yet scared she'll return! Sit down and drink. Cascard won't come back with her. Of course he will, but leave that to me. He went to get her at the station. Here's the telegram. "I'll arrive tomorrow at 10." "Men are all scum. Zaz?." Is it clear? She broke up with him. What could you ask for more? "Men are all scum." Ain't I a man? - Of course not. No, you aren't one of those Zaz? hates right now. This is your opportunity. Zaz? is down. You only have to reach out to get her. Besides, you have everything that can please a woman. I do? - Of course. How much did these cost? 3500 francs. Ah, lovely! Lovely! That's her! That's her! I hear her footsteps. Come! No, stay there instead. It'll be a surprise. The earrings nearby. Ah, my girl! My dear girl, you've finally returned! What a look you have! It's clearly the trip. Traveling nowadays is a nightmare. Where did you go? Tell me, dear. Tell me. I traveled all night. I'm wiped out. I'm in no mood to talk. But your mama has prepared for you a great consolation! I only want to be left in peace. Not to see anybody. Who's there? What's he doing here? - I was about to tell you. Who let him in? I... I just came... Mr De Buysson... - Get out! The last man I wanted to see! I can't stand him! And you bring him here now! Zaz? dear... Get out of here! Get out, I say! Both of you. You too, Ma'am. It's better that you go. Yes, I'm going. I'm going but she's mad! Mad! She's mad. Mad. It's me: Cascard. Zaz?. How could you let yourself be brought to this? And for love? Good. If you start too, we're truly finished. Then he was married? - Yes. He has a child. A girl. A darling little girl who has his eyes. Did you see him? Did you see his wife? Did you speak to her? What did you say? Nothing. What could I say to her who had such an innocent air? Somebody like me. She's his wife, which is just, holy. A daughter, a house. Those are things ordered by God. While I am... I'm a sinner. A lost woman. A bad woman. Nonsense! Nonsense! Your love is just as good as hers. Why? Ah, why? Because that's how the story goes. Just so. Why can't we be born again? Nonsense, I say. Nonsense! He's to blame. He knew his situation. He's like a boy. It was fate. He came off. He missed his train and stayed here. It was just fate. Are you tired? I must have... done something terrible before I was born. Maybe we'll be happy after death. If God allows those things. Nonsense. What have you decided to do? Take up our partnership again. What can we do? We'll go to Ginou in Marseilles. But not right away. And him? I'll never see him again. Maybe that's for the best. Never again. Cascard! Cascard! Cascard! I must leave! Cascard! We must leave this night. Natalie! Cascard, get me out of here! We'll agree to the contract but get me out of here! I can't see him again! Never again! St Etienne! Hey, Dufresne! - Bussy. How is our man in love? Come, invite me to have something. One minute more, one minute less! Let's go. Come with me. A punch for me and the gentleman. But you're paying eh? The least you could do since I introduced you to Zaz?. Who would've said so when we were dining together? But you're so selfish! We never see Zaz? now except in the theater. It's as if you were... husband and wife! I'm leaving my wife. What wife? Mine. I've decided to leave her. I'm married. How about that! You have a wife and you want to leave her. Why? Because of Zaz?. Zaz?? Well... Right, of course. If you're married... Great, thanks. It's little, eh? But, excuse me, why do you need to leave her? In a manner of speaking, we're all married, no? Couldn't you go on as before? Zaz? found out you were married, eh? No, Zaz? knows nothing. - Well then? I don't understand. A wife doesn't have to exclude... others. It wouldn't be the first time. You think it's possible to join together... heaven and hell? Have you thought it over? - I've thought of nothing else. Dear Bussy, I'm a ruined man. Ruined? I'm ruined because... I love my wife as much as Zaz?. Maybe even more than Zaz?. Really? But I can't give up Zaz?. I can't. You see, I wanted to tell all to my wife. But I didn't have the courage. I'm a coward. No! Why? If you like her, why make life so complicated? Goodbye. Poor Zaz?. I've sent down the trunk. Oh, Cascard, I was resting a moment. Having prepared the trunk, made me a little tired. But it's nothing. It's nothing. Oh, God, how I do look! Tomorrow, after a good sleep, it'll all be over. Ah, yes. That's what they say. But I still have to do something and I can't remember. We're just missing something. Natalie! I told you to take something to eat. You did well. I'm hungry. What did I have to do? - Nothing. You mustn't do anything. You must only do what I say, eh? Sit over here and be calm. OK? Now, I'll go to the theater for a moment. I'll be back at 7 to get you. Hey, Cascard! Cascard, where are you going? Where am I going? I just told you. To the theater for a moment and then I'll send for the trunk. But when will you return? When? - I'll be back at 7. At 7? - Yes. And then we'll go to the station, right? Yes, the station. Remember: at 7. It's almost 6:30. You've time to do what you need. Although, it'd be better to leave tomorrow and not travel at night. Anyway... And my stuff? - Don't you remember? I'll be a day in Marseilles to get you settled and return. Let me go. Until 7. Leave the door open for Natalie. Cascard. - What is it? You're very good, Cascard. - Nonsense! I wish you stopped acting like a fool! Natalie! Nata... Zaz?! Zaz?! - Albert? Yes, uh... Excuse me, I'm... in the bathroom and... Listen... Have a seat then! I'll be right out, sit down. Here I am. What's wrong? I was expecting you tomorrow at 9. Did you arrive early? Are you sorry? - What are you saying? Would you like to freshen up? Did you have a nice trip? Yes? There's the bell, it must be Natalie. Did you close the door? I'll go open it. Be back soon. Oh, Natalie! He's inside. Don't say anything about our trip. Act as if nothing happened. If he came back, he won't let you leave. I will leave. Come, hurry up. Oh, there's Natalie. Serve it right away, please. She had seen you come so... Don't stand there like a statue. Serve it. Right away. - No, wait, I'll take it. They sent us the silver. Right, Natalie? Go to the kitchen and bring the covered dishes. Hurry. There, dear. Sit down and eat. I've already eaten. I perform at 7. But I'll make you something. Ah, good, Natalie. You've brought something. Prepare the dishes. But be careful! Excuse the mess, I know you're accustomed to... Ah, yes, now, sit over here. Where's my head? It's almost 7 and I've a show. Now, I'll leave you, dear. I'll come back before 9. Let's do this instead: Come to my room at 8 to look for me. Entrance for you only! - Zaz?. I want you to stay with me tonight. Don't go to the theater. Oh, dear, I can't leave the theater. Alright. Just for a moment. You know how Malardot is. We've fought so many times, he'll wind up firing me this time. Today, Cascard came and you know what he said? That Floriana, you know that girl built like a soldier, who looks pretty in her own way, you know tastes do differ in this world... No, no, Albert. Let go. Let go! Then you still love me? Yes. More than anything? More than anything. More than anything and anyone in the world? More than anyone. More than... more than your wife? How did you find out? Somebody told me. Zaz?, I can't live without you. I don't know what they told you, but look here. Look here: here are 2 tickets to Africa. Leave it all, including the theater. We'll go far away together and they won't keep us apart. Your wife... Does your wife know? Not yet. I didn't have the courage to tell her. But tonight we can write to her. Together. Don't you see you'll ruin yourself because of me? Maybe they'll call it ruin. I know only one thing: That I only feel alive by your side. Albert, if you love me... Why do you look at me like that? Because... For all the while, we have lived together, I thought there was nothing I didn't know about you. I've never noticed this scar across your forehead. From a stone when I was young. Think how many things about you, that I still don't know about. That I will never know. Albert! Albert, tell me that you love me. That you love me, you love me... I love my wife but I love you more. Because I'm ready to leave everything for you. Your wife! Always your wife! Always your wife. At least, don't mention her when you're with me. You're right. We aren't worthy to mention her. - Right. We aren't worthy, eh? We aren't worthy! I should have expected this. See, she's the wife, something sacred. Something legal! While I am... I am the lover, a nobody. Zaz?... - What do you think your wife is? I saw her. You hear? I saw her! You saw my wife? Where? In your home! Well? So what? And I spoke with her. You spoke with her? - That's right, me! I did! So what? Yeah, I get you: she's a lady while me...! Why did you go? It was... to let her know, dear. What did you tell her? What does it matter what I said? Seeing that you're ready to leave everything for me. I told everything. But why? Why? To humiliate her! Because she was too happy! Because she was too naive, you see? When I had told her all, you should have seen her face! After that, the girl came in and she began to cry! Cry, you see? I told her all about us and our love! Our madness! All of it...! Now, get out. It's not true. - It is! Oh, it's true... - It's not! Forgive me, Zaz?, Maybe they told you about my wife and my daughter and you're jealous. Or you want to chase me away. You said it to chase me away. I see it in your eyes. No, it's true! It is! Oh, go away! Go away! When I entered that house, I suddenly thought, "Poor Zaz?, it's over." I was right. They said you had a lover. I was furious when I went there. Your wife wasn't in. I met your girl. - Tot?? You spoke with Tot?? Don't you fear. I didn't say anything that might offend you. On the contrary, how stupid I was! There was even a moment, when I began to cry. How beautiful your daughter is. How pretty! Her eyes, her eyes are blue like yours. And she looks like you. How lucky you are. Help me! Help me. You know that... she began to play a piece on the piano for me. Just for me. Didn't she tell you? They told me of a lady who mistook the street. Ah, yes. They were right. I was mistaken. Poor Tot?. What a heart you must have to leave her. Then I should leave you? Go now. You must return to her. You aren't thinking about me or yourself! Ah, you see, now I can be happy because... when you think about me, you won't have a bad memory of Zaz?. Now, go. Hurry up and go. If not, I won't have the strength... to say goodbye. Go. Don't say a word. Listen... Give Tot? a kiss. Even better: give her two. One on each cheek. Anyway, you don't have to tell her that I sent them. One moment. One moment, one moment, just one more. Goodbye, Albert. Oh, no. Go now. Go now. Goodbye, Zaz?. English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
