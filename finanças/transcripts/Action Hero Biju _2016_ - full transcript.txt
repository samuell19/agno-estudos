I cordially invite you to go to the meeting. Greetings to all. First, I wish you all a happy Independence Day. You are going through the most beautiful phase of life; Esa es tu vida escolar. Narraré un recuerdo de mi vida escolar. Cuando estudiaba en 5º estándar, por hacer algo malo en la escuela; mi profesor de clase - profesor de Sicilykkutty Me dio una buena paliza en el muslo con un bastón. Había una marca en mi muslo por esa paliza y estaba tenso. El problema fue que Por la noche, era mi madre quien solía bañarme. Para que se vea esa marca. If the teacher hit me, it must be because I did something wrong; then my mother also scolded me and hit me. I told him I was sick and not bathe me that day. At the next day, the mark had not disappeared, and neither bathed me that day. But the next day my mother saw him. So to save myself, I said; everyone in the class got beatings, and less. Even if you tell them I got beat up, my parents never had asked the teacher Sicilykkutty, why she gave him up to his son. Even today, when he meets the teacher, my mother says; With the blessings of the teacher, only good things will have happened. Now times have changed. I receive many complaints in my police station, saying that students are being beaten by teachers. I'm talking about my experience; When teachers punish you, there is always a protective armor of love, But this armor of love will not be there, by the punishments given by the police and the public. Previously, when we were forced to stand on a bench, when friends used to make fun of us, We used to get strength and endurance coping, some unknown force. Why do I say this here? Even yesterday I saw a suicide. A woman jumped into the water from the bridge Venduruthy with your child. The child died and an intelligent officer of the Navy who jumped to save them disappeared. Only when they have the strength to face a crisis, People kill themselves. The courage to face any kind of situation; and strength to fly high and conquer the world; It is achieved through your school life. I wish that all they do, with the blessings of his teachers. Thank you! We will not drink in bars and liquor stores. (repeat) Will you drink at home? We can? Do not you should drink at home too! I do not drink at home too. - Now I say all three together!

Sir, I did not ask him this dirty guy who does not follow me and bother me? And you know what he did today? While riding on a bus, he stopped in a style film; and he pulled me holding my hand. I went to tell him not'll never bother you again. He is lying, sir. When I sat on the bus, he stood out; And so I gave a flying kiss. Did not I tell the last time not to follow her? What's wrong with you? I was not giving a flying kiss, sir. I just asked: how can you do this? Is that how you ask that? Not only that, you know what you're saying now? There's something between us now ... YOU! You'd finish today! Lord, do not do anything from now on. Promise! I swear! Your! So if you break the promise, let my head explode. it's not like that?
