Dad... this is my Raju. We're married now. The court has issued our marriage certificate. The Judge is sending us to a Safe Home. We're tired of being chased by you. You need to be in Court on the 14th. You will get the summons soon. I swear dad... Once you meet Raju, you'll change your mind. Alright girl. Time to leave a final message for your old man! I pray to God, Dagar... ...that you fall in love one day. I love you. Officer Rathi, I think Viraj Singh Dagar is back from the dead. Should we get a DNA test done? Sir. Dubey, loosen the rope. You, come this way. Jyoti, I am coming in. Yes! Now you're all mine, nothing else matters. No matter what, I'll never betray you. This romantic pose won't do in Court. We need enough photos to fill an album. You have a lifetime for that. Register your marriage first. Come on, time to exchange garlands. Wait, someone's calling. Who is it? No one. Billo! Why is he calling? Haven't you quit yet? - Speak fast. - Yo! Wassup buddy?! Why are you avoiding me bro? I can't talk right now. You guys look lovely. Why, are you getting married? I'm taking a couple of weeks off. Bro, we have to make the delivery tonight. It's Suraj Bhan's order. Or else Devi Singh will skin us alive. Fine, send me the location. That's my boy! Hey... You've been taking advantage of him for far too long. This ends right now! Tell that pimp Devi Singh... ...that Ashu is done with deliveries. Sister, don't get angry! - Billo, please... - You said you'd quit? Go on, talk to him. What the hell! Why did you throw it in the water? What if my mom calls? Fighting like an old married couple already? Don't get swayed by his innocent face. It's all his fault! Is that so? Go get married to the other guy then. The phone's lost. Never mind sweetheart. Don't be disheartened. Come, let's do this. Love you, miss you, kiss you. Shut up. Ready lovebirds? Smile. Dad, grandma has arrived. How many times do I tell you, child. Unmarried girls don't touch elders' feet. Bless you. Go, touch her feet. I don't need your half-hearted respect. Bless you. Where is Jyoti? Cherry, no. Why are you so distracted? I was thinking about my mom, she must be waiting for me. But you said she is at your aunt's place. Why would I lie, Billo? I didn't say you're lying. Please understand my situation... ...her health is getting worse. Poor thing doesn't even know I'm getting married. If your family didn't object to our relationship, why haven't you told them? My aunt wouldn't have let my mom stay. And what if my brother sends his goons to your place? Here, call your mom. And say what? My bride's family has sent goons over, it's dangerous to step out! There she goes again! Calm down, girl. You won't find a suitable mate here. It must be a tomcat. Will you make do? Is Jyoti ok? She's sleeping. You should get some sleep too. With me and Cherry around, no one can harm you. Get some rest. Sushil! Water... I've been calling out for so long. Why is the jug kept there? Don't move my things from their place, please. Sorry, Sujata, I dozed off. You look tired. Change out and sleep in the other room. I won't feel bad. That nightmare again? No no! Don't worry about me. Bottling your feelings won't help. You were sleep talking again. If you can't talk to me, at least talk to a therapist? Ashu Shokeen. Jyoti Dilawar. Nidhi Dahiya. - How are you related to them? - I was their teacher. Are you working somewhere? I'm a Chartered Accountant. I just completed my Articleship in Delhi. What about you? I manage my father's shop. What kind of shop? Meat shop. How did your family react to your relationship? Your Honour, these are Jyoti's medical reports. Chest trauma, bruised lower back. Who did this to you? My brother, Rakesh. Did you lodge a police complaint against him? No. He's my younger brother. I want to give my family another chance. That's why we've approached the honourable court. And what about your family? See this, you old fogey. - What is this? - Dad! Come on! Tell me what's happening! - Come on! - Ashu, whose gun is this? - Come on! - Don't take him away! Ask them! Ashu! And what about your family, mister? No sir, my family doesn't have any objection. I am granting you temporary shelter at the District Safe Home for one week. Both of you, along with your families, need to appear in court after a week. What if my family doesn't turn up? Then they'll have to face the consequences. The court requires a written statement from them, that they won't cause you any harm. What else can I do for you? It's okay. Be strong. I wish you eternal love. This is it. Let's go. Our very own Taj Mahal! It looks more like a haunted house. Officer Choudhary, look who's flown into the cage. Welcome! Is the toilet attached? Hand over your cell phones. Why? Tell your wife to behave. Got off the wrong side of the bed? Sir... I threw it in the well. Why didn't you jump in as well? Check their bags. Your phone. Show me the rulebook. If I am right, your phone is mine. Show me the rulebook, she says! Don't upload the video. Why are you provoking your grandmother? Don't do it. She'll get these guys to kill us. No. Have you lost your mind, Billo? Don't! What if we want to speak to our family members? We are your family now. You can talk to us anytime. Day or night. Hand over your ID cards. Amazing. You look 14 years old. So you like teenage girls? What's it to you? Whether I bang teenies or grannies. Sir, don't mind her, she's just joking. Stop being a wuss. Burn them. What? Sir... I'm also just joking. Of course... Sign here. 700 rupees? For what? 500 is for security deposit, 200 weekly rent. Security deposit? Do we look like thieves? You don't look like runaway lovers either. Relax, I'm just asking. I am relaxed. You! have a bug up your ass. Bloody thugs. Don't give me attitude. I hope the sheets are clean. Well, let's just say they carry the scent of lovers. Anyway, I'm sure you're used to dropping your pants anywhere. Here, Bunker No. 4 Enjoy your mattresses. Carry on. Listen, here's your free gift. Don't forget to use it. I am not running a nursery here. Sir, it's not like... - May I? - Of course! Welcome to Love Hostel. Want me to carry it? Are you sure? Will you lock us inside? What if there's a fire? Don't worry. He will take care of your fire. And if she wants more, give her a cold shower. Go on. Move it. Ignore him. I don't know what I am feeling. I am happy but there is anger too. I'm happy to be with the one I love, but angry to leave my family behind. Ashu and I went to Court today. Our marriage has been registered and the Judge has granted us a Safe Home. I'd like to request you to be present in court on the 22nd and give us your blessings. If anything goes wrong, I'll hold you responsible, Grandma, as you have the political clout. But I hope you won't misuse your power. I hope this news hasn't gone viral. No channel would dare to without my permission. It's my fault... I should've strangled her the day she was born. Why didn't your father strangle you? And what about these guys, Dilawar? I'm terribly sorry but... we're done here. We've spent half a million for the engagement. Her wedding gown cost us 1.5 lacs... And another five lacs for the helicopter. Now that things have gone south just pay me for what I have spent and let's call it quits. As I see it, we have a way forward. Nothing has to change. All your deals, or the wedding date. Just replace Jyoti with Babli. What are you saying, sir? Who cares if it's Jyoti or Babli behind the veil? If you keep your word... your respect will be intact in the community. But Babli is still a child. She's not old enough to get married. And what will you tell the people you've invited to the wedding - 'The wedding is cancelled. My daughter has run away!' Listen Baldev, nothing changes till I say so. Got it? I won't say it again. What's the boy's name? He's Muslim Jat... Ahmed Shokeen. But he goes by Ashu Shokeen. Good evening, sir. I have an offer for you. Our credit card has a lifetime offer of 10% cashback. This is valid at all gas stations. Sir, your bill is 4000 rupees. Will you pay by cash or card? You can use our credit card to pay... Greetings, Mr. Dagar I'm sending you a video. Kamala Dilawar's granddaughter has eloped with a Muslim boy. Find out which Safe Home are they screwing in. Who's the lawyer? Ashok Khanna. I'm sending his address. Message me once it's done. Sorry Mr. Dagar I didn't recognise you. I too was nervous on my first day. When is your next hearing? In a week. Do you think your family will agree? How long have you been here? We were supposed to be here for a week. But it's been six months now. Six months! At least we are alive. Nobody knows what the future holds. None of our families turned up at the court hearings. We would've been better off in jail. At least we could work and earn some money. This Choudhary is bleeding us dry. But you don't lose hope. I'm sure this won't happen to you. I can read it on your face. How come you couldn't read your family's face? I was just trying to cheer you up. Here's your wedding gift from all of us. See that box over there. That's your ticket to privacy. Put this money in and enjoy your wedding night. - Hi, Dad. - Hey, kiddo. Dad, do you remember Jyoti Dilawar? My friend from NCC. What about her? She put up a post yesterday... saying she has run away with a boy, and if anything happens to her then her grandmother Kamala Dilawar is to blame. She's an MLA, right? Send me the link. That's the disturbing part Dad. It says, the post has been removed due to objectionable content. I think they got the post deleted, because he's Muslim Jat. What's the boy's name? I think Ashu. Ashu Shokeen? Who is Ashu Shokeen? Dad I just reached the airport. Message me. Bye. Sir. Have you started drinking already? I swear, I'm just having a cup of tea. - Note down these two names. - Okay, sir. Ashu Shokeen and Jyoti Dilawar. Check all court marriages registered in the last 24 hours. If these two names show up, find out which Safe Home they have been sent to. And keep a look out for Shokeen's tracker. Okay, sir. If there's any movement, call me immediately. Jai Hind, sir. Fucker, did you become a lawyer... to help our daughters marry Muslim boys? I won't tell you anything. Shoot me if you want. This bravado will make your son an orphan. Start singing now. I'm all ears. Which Safe Home are they in? If I had to spill the beans, I would have told Kamala Dilawar, instead of helping them get married. You need help, Dagar. You're delusional... that you're making this world a better place. I have dedicated my life to cleansing this society, and you're calling me delusional? You delusional fucker... liberals like you are brainwashing our kids. Never mind. Let me help you. Billo! What're you doing? What's up with you? They have turned this safe house into a whorehouse. Paying money to sleep with my wife! Like mutes. It is what it is. Where's the condom? We're married now. Why do we need to use a condom? No wonder you guys end up having so many kids. Really? And you still think I am hesitant? Come on Shokeen... Don't get comfortable yet. Choudhary sir would like to see you. Come on... Don't worry, your darling wife is not going anywhere. I'm coming. Billo, I'll be back in 10 minutes. Let me go and hear him out. Stop being a 'yes man' Ashu. You have time for everybody but me. This will drive us apart. I'll be back in a flash. I promise. Sit. I forgot to ask you... has your wife taken your vows? Or will you make do with court marriage? She doesn't believe in all this or she wouldn't have married me. But I am sure you would want her to. No, I don't. I'm okay with whatever she decides. I know you guys are okay with marrying your cousins, why do you spare your own? Never mind. Have some sweets. Devi Singh sends his blessings. Weren't you supposed to carry out tonight's delivery? Diler is waiting for you. Choudhary sir, I have taken time off work. Then you should go to Bangkok. Why are you wasting your time here? Fine, tell Devi Singh yourself. Why are you forcing me? There are many others for this job. How long can you force me to work like this? Then do it at your will. But my will is to be here with my wife. I know this is your wedding night... but surely it's not your first night together. Devi Singh has sent a wedding gift for you. Make the delivery and it's yours. No matter how much you provoke me, I'll not make the delivery. Bhagwan Singh... Bhagwan Singh! Never around when you need him. Where is it? Right after you got married this frame fell. Don't tell your wife you saw this. She'll get terrified. Dagar has texted. The girl is at Bahadurgarh Safe Home. The one you had inaugurated. Don't feel offended Kamala, but by opening these Safe Home brothels, you're the one sheltering these runaways. I don't care if this offends you, but politics is beyond your understanding. If I have opened these Safe Homes, I get to control them as well. And what if Dilawar gives his blessings in court? When is the hearing? A week later. You will get the Summons in a day or two. Keep an eye on Babli till the wedding. But I want Jyoti back alive. I'll bury her with my own bare hands. Turn off the engine, bro. And put your phone on silent mode. Wait, I'll be right back. How's my Ahmed? He's fine. He's married now. - Did you go to the wedding? - Yes. The entire Bahadurgarh fort had been decorated for the wedding. Tell Ahmed not to worry about me. I am fine. He should take care of his wife. Else, those monsters will take her away too. For no fault of hers. See, the cat's back. Mom! You needn't worry, Ahmed will take you home very soon. Here, take this bangle for Ahmed's wife. Hello? Sir, Shokeen's tracker is active. What should we do? Conduct the raid only after the boy leaves. Clear? Ever since you got hitched, you're ignoring your poor father? I visited the prison four bloody times. But I didn't have the guts to meet my father. Why? How could I tell him... By speaking up? That the people you're fighting... your son's licking their ass. Your father was going to report me to the police. Who the fuck was going to check your fridge... whether it was buff meat or lamb? I'm done with your threats. I haven't even begun dumbass. And no matter what I do for you... you were never getting my dad out of prison. Clever boy! - Now listen to me carefully. - What? This is my last delivery. I see. You and I are done after this. Do you understand you bloody scamster! Then you can wish your dad goodbye... Have to give it to you, man. You've stirred the hornet's nest. Look who's here! Come in, Shokeen. Took your own sweet time. The money. What's the rush? Have a drink. Yeah. I don't drink. Don't feel shy. Who refuses a free drink? What a dummy! Fine, have a soda then. Come on... - I'm getting late. - Sit. - I'm in a hurry. - Sit the fuck down! That's his style. What did one Muslim Jat say to another? Not that joke again. I'll die. Some other joke. Here's another. A Muslim Jat dies. He was bloody rich but illiterate. Illiterate! In his will he gave all his property to his son Mehmood. Mehmood is rich! When Mehmood went to the Registrar, he was asked to show his ID. So, Mehmood pulled out his ID card. Guess what his name on the card was? Sunil! His ID card said Sunil. His driver's license, bank account, passport... they all had the same fucking name - Sunil! Poor Mehmood! Poor again! It has been six years... Poor guy's going insane. His land is wasting away, and he sells lemons at a bus stop. Poor Mehmood! 10 bucks for 3 lemons! 10 for 3! I want to fucking pee! I'll be right back. This fucker keeps slipping away. The money. You fucking sellout. I know you're a police informant. No wonder Aurangzeb could get you into his fold. And whose fold are you in? Why are you in this trade? Shokeen... Come on out. You're dead meat. Fuck! Officer Rathi, I agreed to work with you to get my father out of jail, and not to be locked up with him. Tomorrow's headlines will read, terrorist's son flees after killing cops. Wait for me, Ahmed. Don't risk going out. My life is so fucked up right now. No matter what I do... they will never trust me. Community Leaders, Devi Singh, and now you and your men are baying for my blood. Isn't it? I should never have trusted you. Thank you, but no thank you. Shokeen... Which name is on your father's will? Ashu or Ahmed? My father... is alive, motherfucker. I know. Your best friend Diler... kept the AK-47 in your shop. And now, your father's a living ghost in prison. Wow! You've got blood on your face. Shokeen made it out alive, boss. So kill him, you dumbfuck. Make sure we don't lose the money. Diler, my dear friend. Brother, what a long life you have! We need to go back. Right now. Bloody hell... The girl is upstairs. The boy... The boy? He's out for a delivery. He's nearby. Have some tea, he'll be back soon. So, you don't make enough guarding these runaways... that you've sold your soul to Devi Singh? On my salary, I can't even afford a lipstick for my wife. So now you will wear lipstick and run brothels. You should change your surname, because pimps like you are a disgrace to the community. Fuck you! Mr. Dagar, I know I'm a disgrace. Go ahead and punish me, but please don't kill me. My wife is pregnant. Ok fine, give me a smile. I'll send this photo to your wife. Is it just my dad or do you hate all Muslims? Did it ever occur to you that... your actions labelled an innocent man, a terrorist. I know you won't believe me, my friend, I'll bear this burden all my life. I really tried to change but this is who I am. Try to forgive... Billo! Billo! Where have you been? Where are your slippers? Upstairs. Go fetch them! Let's go. Oh shit! It's okay, it's okay. Go hide behind the car. What's in the bag? Your dowry. I told you don't upload the video. Your grandma has unleashed the devil upon us. Uncle! Blood... Now what? Billo? Billo? - Give it to me. - Give you what? - Just give me the gun. - Have you lost your mind? Just fucking give it to me! What do you want? To carry you around? They must be drunks. Don't be reckless. I think it's too late for that now. What the hell... Billo! Sajid! Stop... Didn't I tell you, they'll come after us! It's okay. Look, Rathi. You are aware that Dagar died seven years ago. Thousands attended his funeral. Even a death certificate was submitted. Sir, it was all a sham. They took an old man's corpse from the medical college and cremated it. I went to the cremation ground when I heard of it. The corpse didn't even have teeth. When this trickery failed Dagar went underground and a missing complaint was filed. See this, sir. Yet another death certificate was issued three weeks ago. Get in. - Sir - How's Sujata? She thinks she's about to die. Take a couple of weeks off from work. Spend some time with her. I'll hand over this case... If Dagar was not involved... would you say the same thing? Look, Rathi I'll have to order an inquiry for the hotel shootout. Take a break from being a policeman and focus on being a family man. Sir, I'm worried Kamala Dilawar will interfere with the working of the Inquiry Committee. She'll allege the boy is a terrorist. So even if he manages to escape from Dagar, the Inquiry Committee won't spare the boy. Think before you speak, Rathi. Your baseless allegations against Kamala can trigger riots in the city. Would you rather I sit at home and wait for the winds to change direction? All I'm saying is, this has become personal to you. You see your brother in Shokeen. Aman, give me three days to find Ahmed. If I fail, I'll do as you say. Greetings Dagar Sir. What's her name? Sir, Bijli. JYOTI Where were you? Calm down. Who are these guys? Param and Sajid. Don't worry, their story is similar to ours. What's going on here? Get out! Madam, he needs to be admitted. That's not possible. He has lost a lot of blood. I have to follow protocol. In any case I can't discharge him without a police complaint. Let's go file a complaint. You relax. Take off your clothes. Hurry up! Where are you taking us? America. Here are the ID's. Sir, Jyoti's phone. Get it unlocked. Okay, sir. This is their Court Order. Their lawyer... the one whose family was wiped out by that bastard. Hello? Nidhi Dahiya? - Yes. Who's this? - DSP Sushil Rathi. How did you get my number? From Ashu Shokeen and Jyoti Dilawar's Court Order. Can you come to Rohtak Police Station? I'm in Chandigarh, on Exam Duty. Your lawyer has been murdered. Jyoti and Ashu are in danger. Who was it? Dagar. I've called to warn you. I too had warned you, 12 years ago... about my sister Tulsi and your brother Yogi being in danger. You did nothing about it until it was too late. Where are you, Jyoti? After you left, they decided to marry me off to Chand. Dad and I have been miserable ever since. You know our Grandma... she never opened her mouth in the meeting... and secretly sent Dagar after you. I'm certain. Dad is ashamed of himself... that the fate of his daughters... is being decided by others. Dad, talk to Jyoti. I love you, my child. You'll always be my princess. If anything happens to you, I'll never forgive myself. Don't worry... I don't care about my reputation anymore. I just need to do two things - Give my blessings in court... and stop Babli's wedding. I'm sure you're not here to make small talk. I'm here to talk to you about Dagar. There he is. That one is Dagar as well. And this boy hiding behind me... He is Dagar too. Which Dagar are you looking for? Don't be so heartless. Change your decision and give Jyoti your blessings. And hand Dagar over to me. Jyoti had my blessings... but she chose Eid over Diwali. Look, Rathi these are 600-year-old traditions. Neither you nor I have the power to change them. "If anything goes wrong, I'll hold you responsible Grandma. as you have the political clout. But I hope you will not misuse your power." Jyoti is my princess. If anything happens to Ahmed and Jyoti, this video will lead to your downfall. Don't play with fire, Rathi you'll get burnt. Stop worrying about me and worry about how your actions might affect your daughter's future. - Where's the bag? - Over there. He's tracked us down. Get up. I have good news... Dad has given us his blessings. Go, get Babli here. Dad? Babli? Why don't you call your brother and grandma here as well. They are getting Babli married to Chand. She'd rather die. What do you want me to do? Marry Babli as well? Shut up. Don't get cheap with me. You think you're the only one with problems? "My mom, my dad, my shop" What about me? Stop lecturing me! Even if I took your vows... you'll never treat me as an equal. If we were equals... we would have had a grand wedding. We wouldn't be running for our lives. Only when you imagined me in bed with Chand, did you finally decide to act. If I didn't run away from home... you would still be twiddling your thumbs. Grand wedding, my foot! I've left my sick mother with someone just for you and this is twiddling my thumbs for you? Fine. Go back to your mother. Go take care of her. I don't need any favours. Billo... stop. Is it the right size? Thank you. Billo! No! Stop! Get out. Now! Give it to me. Move aside! Go go. Good girl, Cherry. Stay. You are right. I can't bear to see you with anyone else. The truth is... I might be able to live without you, but it won't be a life worth living, Billo. Not without you. Stop, that's enough. I am done running... from the world, from you, and from myself. Hold me close, Billo. Hold me. I only want to be in your arms. I never want to be away from you. Not for a moment. This is Mom's wedding gift for you. You're giving this to me now? Be happy that you're getting it... mom hasn't even seen you yet. Let's bring her here. No, Billo. That house is not for you. My uncle will throw a fit if he sees you. It's ok. You go and get her here. And Babli too. We'll handle the rest. How's your bride, Ahmed? Why didn't you get her? Here, take this. Give this to your bride. Hello? Sir, the teacher's house is locked. Are there any CCTV cameras? No, sir. I don't see any security guard nor any CCTV camera. Then you stand guard and inform me if you see anyone entering the house. - Okay? - Yes. Jai Hind, sir. Jai Hind. Dad? You consumed your mother as well. What's with the withered flowers? What to do, can't blame the flowers for withering in this weather. Why are you here? Madam has ordered sweets for the wedding party. Have a look. Open the gate. Let's go, Babli. Jyoti's sent for you. Nobody act smart. Hey! Put the gun down, you bastard. Else I'll bury you alive. Stay out of this! Step aside. Put your guns down. Ahmed, don't get blood on your hands. Hand me the gun. He's the one you should have dealt with first. Shut up. - Stay out of this. - Have you lost your mind? Your daughters' love has blinded you. Enough of your dictatorship. I won't allow you to play dirty politics with my family. Whether you kill me or not... you are a dead man, Dilawar. Go Babli. Go. Fuck! Welcome... you've come at the right time. Let her go, Dad. She is not at fault. Do you remember the story of Lord Krishna, the one your uncle would recite to you? One day, Ma Yashoda caught Him eating soil, but Lord Krishna denied it. Ma Yashoda said, "Liar! Open your mouth." And what did Yashoda see inside Lord Krishna's mouth? The Universe. So, tell me the moral of the story, I promise, I'll let her go. Your word creates your world. Did you keep your word? That you will never help runaways ever again. Every time you break your word, my world comes crashing down. Aren't I paying the price? Living away from my family. How long will you keep punishing these innocent people to avenge uncle's suicide? He wasn't just my brother, he was my god. God. He was worshipped by everyone. His daughter took advantage of his trust, and you helped her run away... but my brother had to pay the price... with his life. Isn't this unfair, Sonu? No matter where you go, my grandmother controls everything. The truth is... You and Jyoti are my real heroes. You are one smart girl. If you have a boyfriend, we can take him along as well. No? Doesn't mom miss me? Give me a smile. I'll send your photo to your mother. Dad, please, I'm sorry. Please let Jyoti go. Go say sorry to your sister and uncle first. Run, Jyoti. Are you ok? It's freezing. Is this better? I am sorry! I'll always be your yes man. Love you, miss you, kiss you.
