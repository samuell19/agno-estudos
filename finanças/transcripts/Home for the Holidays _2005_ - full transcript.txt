- Two occupants, one male, one female. Both deceased at the crash site. And Sarah, it's John and Susan McMurrin. Oh my God, those poor kids. What will they do? - Looks like they hit an icy patch of road and uh... Should I call Martha? - No, I'll take care of that. And Sarah, better call the child welfare. - Hello. Yeah. What? Oh, no. Oh no, no, no, no. What happened? Oh, my God! - Michael, mom asked me to make sure you ate everything on your plate, peas included. - Mommy, mommy! Mommy, mommy! Mommy, mommy, what did you get me? - Michael, get back inside. What's wrong aunt Martha? - I just need a few moments alone, okay? - This is the hardest part of the job. - You've done this before? - Well it seems like every couple of years this town gets hit by tragedy. Either a farm mishap or a car crash. Last year the Krems lost their little boy in a creek. - This is my first case. I would rather face down a lion than deal with those kids tonight. - It never gets any easier. - And so close to Christmas. - It's a shame. A damn shame. - I'm so sorry. - My name is Paige Holloway. I'm a case officer with Children's Services. I'm here to help any way that I can. - What's going to happen to us? - Don't you worry about that right now. Everything will be taken care of, you don't have to worry about anything. - Well, we'll stay together Amy, I can promise you that. - Is there someone that I can call to come stay with you? A friend or a relative? - No, no we just, we just need some time alone, that's all. I'm all they have left in the world. - Here's my card. Call me if you need anything, okay? Anything at all. I'll drop by in the morning. - It'll be easier on him. He's too young to understand. - I'm not so sure. You're up. - Mhmm, good morning. Yeah, we're all up. Well, Michael's still sleeping. - Here. - Oh, that is so thoughtful. Thank you for thinking of us. - Oh, it's just that social worker. I hope she's not here to take us away. - Sam, Amy, now you listen to me. Miss Holloway is a very nice lady and she's here to help. You need to listen and you need to mind your manners, you understand me? - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. - Sam, the last thing I want to do is take you and your sister and brother away from the home you know and the people you love. - There, you see? She's here to help. Now, she brought us some food. I want you guys to eat it while we, while we have a little talk. Go on. - You manage any sleep? - No. - How'd last night go? - Well the twins have accepted it as best can be expected but, Michael, he's in his own world. I'm a little worried about him. - Children deal with trauma in different ways. Sometimes it takes time for it to sink in. - Yeah. Well, you're the expert. - Actually, this is my first week on the job. I've been with the department for three years, desk job. So, this is my first time out in the field with cases of my own. - Well then we can learn together. - Miss McCarthy, from here on try and take things one day at a time. Try, try one hour at a time. You can call me Martha. - Okay, if you'll call me Paige. - So what's next? - Next? - Where do we go to from here? - Oh, there'll be plenty of time later to discuss those options. - Well, if you don't mind I'd like to discuss them now. - Okay. First the children will need a legal guardian. - That'll be me. - I hope so, but I have to be frank. It's not automatic. There are a series of events that need to take place before the department, or the courts, will give approval for you. - Approval for me to take care of my sister's children? I am their aunt. I'm their only relative. Look I didn't ask to be put in this position. Okay, but here I am, and there they are and we need each other. - All I meant to say was, there's a process. There's paperwork, a formal assessment. - An assessment? The department needs to be sure that the guardian is capable of caring for the children. - I'm capable and I'm here. And I know it's what Susan and Jonathan would have wanted. - And you know this because? - Because we talked about it. In case anything would have happened to them. I agreed that I'd be the one to take care of them. And I know it's in the will. - Well, in that case I can grant you temporary custody right now. And I can get the paperwork started for permanent custody. - Good. I'll uh, I'll move my stuff in here tomorrow after the funeral services. - Okay. - Thanks, thanks a lot. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Thanks, thank you. - If you need anything done around the farm, Martha, you just, just let me know alright? - Thanks Ned, thank you. Oh, Roger. - Look, what's this I hear about your coming back to work on Monday? - Well when the kids are back in school I thought that I'd... - I'm sure I can look after the shop until you're, well, til you're back on your feet. - Actually... - I know what you're going through, okay? So just take all the time you need. - Thank you. - Okay. - Doing okay? - Fine. Susan would have loved all of this attention. - It's the power lines, you know. - What is? - Everything is, everything bad, that is. The county's gone to hell. You know it's just, people are selling out and moving on. It's a damn shame. Used to be you could raise up your family, but oh. We're losing our sense of community, Martha. I don't know what we're going to do about it. With gas prices what they are, well. It's a wonder we survive at all. Time was when I knew everyone in Riverton and what they were doing. I don't know half of what's going on anymore. I'm losing control. I don't know what we're going to do. Who are these people that are coming in here? - Excuse me, Martha, but the flower delivery guy needs your signature. - Oh. - Martha, you must tell me once you get settled. I'm going to make you a nice shepherd's pie. - Lois, isn't it? - Yes, Lois Krem. You're new in town, aren't you? - If I could just get your signature right here, please. Thank you, my condolences. - Thank you, yes. Jack? - Martha. Here. - Ohh. Oh! Did you come all the way from San Francisco? - Yeah, I just, I heard the news and came right away. Oh, Martha I'm so sorry about what happened. - Let me introduce you. Paige, this is an old friend of mine, Jack Cooper. - It's nice to meet you, Mr. Cooper. - I wish the circumstances were different. - Don't we all. - Coop? - Hey, Rog, how are you? I'm good, I'm good. Remember you owe me 20 bucks from that bet in '98. I took Dallas. You had Dallas? I had Dallas, what are you talking about? Now you're a big shot lawyer I guess I can't sue you for it. Come on, I'll buy you a drink, we'll call it even, come on. - Thank you. - Friend, huh? - Miss McCarthy. - Jonathan, we've known each other since I was three years old. Please, call me Martha. - Martha, I know this is probably the wrong time, but there's the matter of the will. - What about it? - Well there's a stipulation of the departed's loan agreement. You can bring in a lawyer if you want to. - Is that a requirement? - No, no, no, not at all. Tuesday afternoon be okay, say three o'clock? - That will be fine. - You have my condolences. - Thank you. - You look good. Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la, la la la la Don we now our gay apparel Fa la la la la La la la la Troll the ancient yuletide carol, Fa la la la la, la la la la Fa la la la la, la la la la - Can I give you a hand, Bob? - Sure thing, Jack. Mind handing me these when I get up the ladder? - Sure. I didn't know you went in for this kind of thing. - Well it's for the kids around here. Makes me a kinder, gentler sheriff. Don't you think? - I seem to remember a few years ago when you put the fear of God in me. - Well, kids today aren't nearly as wild as we were, Jack. - Excuse me. Cooper. I know I'm not there. No, Taylor can handle the brief today. That'll buy me a couple days. Jim, look, he's been with the firm for a year, he's ready. Well tell him to call me if he gets in trouble. No, no just a few days, okay? Alright. - So, you thinking of hanging around for a while? - I don't know. - I can think of some who wouldn't mind. - They say you can never go back. - Jack, for quite a few of us around here, you never, ever left. - Thanks, buddy. - Michael, Sam, aunt Martha's here! Wow, you sure got a lot of stuff, aunt Martha. Yeah, everything I own. - You can have mom and dad's room. It has a bathroom, a TV and everything. - Oh, that's okay, I'll stay in the sewing room. - Okay, but it's kind of small. - I know, when I was a little girl it was my room. - Really, you lived here? - My father, your grandfather, he built this house with his own two hands. - Wow. Aunt Martha, I'm so happy you're coming to live with us. Sam said we'd all be going to an orphanage. - Well, we're a family now and the most important thing is that we stick together through thick and thin. - I told him you wouldn't let us go to an orphanage. - Here Sammy, here Michael. - Hey, I went by your place to help you pack, but you'd already left. - Well I didn't want to leave the kids too long. - Any second thoughts? - I haven't had any time to have second thoughts. - Do you want these in your room? - Yes, please. - Aunt Martha? - Uh, upstairs, bathroom. - I told you. - Sure you can handle this? - Somehow we'll get by. - Raising three young children won't be easy. - Yeah, I know. But eventually I'll get used to two hours of sleep and doing a lot of laundry. - I've got the document that will grant you full custody of the children, pending the assessment. - Um, you want some coffee? - Sure. - Good, me too. I think all we have left, yeah, is instant Copenhagen Mocha Delight. Is that okay? - Beggars can't be choosers. Okay, this says that you will provide for the children and that you understand that there will be an assessment at a later date as to their permanent situation. It also authorizes a routine background check. - Oh, my heart's beating fast. - I'm sure you'll be fine. There is one consideration we need to discuss. - I know, money. - In foster care the state would pay for everything, but once you assume guardianship you're on the hook. - Yeah, I've been thinking about that. - And? - Well you know I have the part time job at the antique boutique, but it could become a full time job just for the asking. And then there's Susan and John's life insurance and I have, I have a small savings. - Well you really have a handle on this. Now, if you don't mind my asking, what's with you and Jack Cooper? - Nothing. We were close once. - Close? - Oh, Paige, you know. Puppy love, nothing serious. Hello. Will you take that up to my room, please? Okay. - Has Michael mentioned anything about what's happened yet? - Not a peep. - I hear from Lois Krem that Jack is divorced. - I didn't know that. - Sam, that's my sock. Which, the green one or the blue one? - The one with the stripe. - No, it's mine. I have another one just like it somewhere. - Take it off I don't want you wearing my stuff. - Stop it, you two. Sam you're giving that sock back after school. And if you miss the bus and I have to drive you to school, there's going to be hell to pay. Now, go on. - Hurry up, Michael, the bus! - Hey, hey, hey, thank you. Bye. Look, I didn't ask to be put in this position. Yet, here I am and here they are and we need each other. - Actually, this is my first week on the job. - I know this is probably the wrong time, but there's the matter of the will. - Once you have sole guardianship, you're on the hook. You're on the hook. - Hello. - Martha? - Oh, Roger, I'm late again. I'm sorry. I just dozed off for a minute. - Don't worry about it, Martha. Look, maybe you should take the rest of the week off. - I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. At least that's what I always say, anyway. Martha, how are you managing? - I don't know, we're coping, I guess. I'll be in on Thursday, for sure. - Okay then, we'll see you Thursday, alright? - Okay, I'll be there. Wait a minute. Here you go. Here Michael. - Aunt Martha, don't worry about us. We don't need Christmas presents this year. - Yeah, it's just a bunch of stuff to play with. Who needs it anyway? - Well, we have a tree and we have stockings, so let's hang stockings up, okay? See what happens, see what Santa brings us. - It's okay, really, if Santa doesn't visit us this year. - Come on. It's time for bed, goodnight. Goodnight. - Hello. Martha? - Jack? - I'm sorry to call so late. - I didn't know you were still in town. - Yeah, Martha I wanted to come by and see you, but I can't walk out the door without somebody trying to talk my ear off about all the changes that's happened to Riverton. - Well there are a lot of changes. We're even getting a strip mall. - That'll sure put 'em on the map, huh? I wonder if the old place could use a new lawyer. - Well we could certainly use an honest one. - Ow, Martha. You sure haven't changed. - Why, what do you remember? - Look, I wanted to see you. - I'd like to see you, too. - I gotta be back in San Francisco the day after tomorrow. - Oh, well I've got to go, actually, Michael just woke up and being a school night and all it... - I understand. I'll call you. - Have a nice trip. What are you doing up? Hmm? Come on, let's go. - Paige Holloway. - Hey, it's Martha. They're reading the will at three o'clock today at the bank. - I see. - Paige, I know you're busy, but I just don't feel like I can face this alone. - Martha why not ask Jack Cooper to join you? - Oh, I don't think that's such a good idea. - Okay, well how about we meet at the deli, say around 2:15? We can grab a coffee first. - Okay. Listen, I really appreciate this. - Okay, bye bye. - Come in to my office, Miss Holloway. Close the door, dear, and sit down. I've reviewed the McMurrin file. Tragic, simply tragic. - Martha McCarthy is doing her best to provide a loving and stable environment for the children. - Yes, I've read your report. Paige dear, you cannot allow one file to dominate your time. It isn't fair to the county who pays you or to the other families who just as desperately need your assistance. - I'm just trying to help. - I want you to read this thoroughly. That manual outlines our procedures to the letter. Each rule is in place to protect children and their social workers. I won't tolerate exceptions. Now, take young Michael McMurrin for example. Have you scheduled that boy's psychiatric evaluation? - I think that in time he'll come around. Except for not talking he seems fine. - He may very well come around in time, but Paige, he may also withdraw further. Only the district psychologist can make that judgment. - Yes, ma'am, I'll arrange it. - And I see you've extended the assessment for Martha McCarthy. - Yes. - If we are going to be forced to place those children in homes, that process must start as quickly as possible. With luck we may find a family who is willing to take both twins. - Now might not be the best time for Martha. - That assessment must be completed within 10 days of granting temporary custody. I'll do the evaluation myself. - But Miss Parker, I... - You've quite a caseload already, I'll take over the assessment. Have you updated your other files? - I'm just getting to them. - I suggest you read that manual. - I'll have it read by tomorrow morning. - Hey. - You're looking better. - Why, how bad did I look? Sorry. Well, I dropped the kids off at school bright and early and I'm pretty tired. - It's a huge life adjustment for you. Give yourself credit, you're doing a great job. - It seems like when I get the hang of it something else happens. - One day at a time. - Yeah, I remember. What? - I'm not doing your guardianship assessment. - Why not? - Carol Parker, my supervisor. - Oh great! - Martha, Miss Parker is strictly by the book, but she is fair. - Oh yeah, yeah, fair, that's always how I've seen her, fair, Miss Fair. Well, what if Miss Fair refuses to give me custody? - Are you concerned about the assessment? - I am concerned about everything, Paige. What if I fail the assessment? - Are there any other relatives who could take them? - No, I'm it on our side. John has a brother in Oregon, but he's already got five kids and they weren't close. - Look, if there are no relatives able to assume guardianship then the children will become wards of the state and placed in foster homes. - Foster homes, as in more than one. - It's almost impossible to place three children in the same home, they could be separated. Maybe into three homes, maybe even out of the county. - Yeah, of course, separate the twins, makes perfect sense, yeah. Who invented social services, anyway? - I know, I know. Martha look, Martha could you just wait a minute. - Okay, what? - I need to take Michael away for a few days, for an evaluation. - I am not giving those kids up one at a time. Michael's quiet, he just needs time. It's routine in these cases. - These cases, what case? - Michael's behavior is, well, he needs a professional opinion. - And? Okay, I agree that Michael may not understand what's happened, okay. But... Okay, for how long? - I have made an appointment with the district child psychologist for tomorrow. I promise that... - What? - I promise he'll only be gone a few days, then he'll be back home. - And they're not going to give him any drugs or shocks or anything will they? - No, of course not. They'll simply observe him and then send me the assessment. - Is that all you social workers ever do is make assessments? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - The system thrives on paperwork. There is a tendency to avoid making decisions until a child turns 18 and then it's out of their hands. I hope that one day I can help change that. - As in make a difference? - Well, it's worth a shot. - I knew there was something about you I liked. - Refresh your coffees? - Make mine a double, Sally. - Just to let you know we started a little fund up for the kids. We keep it up at the till. - Everybody's being so nice. - You know when I lost my Joe two years ago, your sister, she came to see my kids were fed every night for weeks. - That's the kind of person she was. I miss her. - Yeah, me too. And this coffee hon, it's on the house. - Oh! - You see? You're not in this alone. - Okay, I'm not alone, but with taxes and mortgages and low wages, people don't have much to give. Oh, is it time to go? - It's five to. - Okay. Let's go see why Jonathan's being so nice to me. - I'm not one for formalities so we'll get right to the reading of the will. If you don't mind we'll skip the addendum regarding the decedent's wishes for Martha to take the children. - I'd like to see that, please. - And you are? - Paige Holloway, Children's Services and Martha's friend. - The last will and testament of John and Susan McMurrin. In the event of our death or incapacitation the Riverton Bank and/or its designate will be the sole and only executor of this will. It is understood that in exchange for providing a second mortgage on the property as well as an equipment loan secured by future crop sales, the property legally designated by county statutes as farm lot 261, also known as the McMurrin farm, in the county of Riverton in the state of Washington. I, John McMurrin and I, Susan McMurrin, hereby and with sound mind agree that the Riverton Bank is entitled to first beneficiary position. Any and all further funds or materials as may be remaining are to be transferred to a trust account for the children to be administered by Martha McCarthy. - How much is remaining on the loan? - Loans, Martha, loans. - Okay, how much is remaining on the loans? - I have that here. There is $363,785 on the first mortgage. $144,560 on the second and $87,029... - Okay, it really doesn't matter how much the total is. How much do the children get? - Well there's one more thing. The only assets of any appreciable value here are the farm and the life insurance policy. Used farm equipment is of very little value and zero value is assigned to future crops because there won't be any. Now as the beneficiary, the bank will be paid by the insurance company for the small $100,000 dollar life policy and that will cover the equipment loans. - Well, I could sell the right of way to the power company and then... - I'm afraid it's not quite that simple. - Why? - You missed the county's appeals deadline. Now the farm has fallen under what is called eminent domain. - Eminent domain? - It means the farm has been legally stolen. - Yes, well, expropriation is a more accurate term. - You're taking the whole farm? - I'm not taking anything. The title has already been transferred to the power company. The county has issued a payment to the McMurrin estate for the fair market value of $512,000 dollars. - You can't take our farm. That farm has been in our family for three generations. - I'm not taking anybody's farm, Miss McCarthy! My only concern here is the outstanding loan owed to the bank. The bank is a business and I need to make good on the farm's outstanding debts in accordance with the wishes of your brother-in-law and sister. Now in light of the situation I've also arranged for the power company to pay the county directly for the purchase of the farm. - Just tell me, how much money do the children get? - The staff worked out the numbers. Let's see. Including $12,000 dollars in outstanding taxes and other incidentals, at the end of the day the McMurrin estate is in arrears to the bank for $2,100... - You're owed money? - Simply put, the assets don't cover the loans. - Oh, my God. So, the children don't get any money? - I'm a fair man, Miss McCarthy. I didn't charge any fees for the bank's services and considering the situation, I'm quite willing to call it even. - Well, that is just so sweet of you, Jonathan. Paige, there's got to be something that we can do. Some way that we can appeal this. - Jack will know. - I assure you, it's quite legal and above board. - When we were kids and your family lost its farm, we all chipped in to help. - Yes, I remember. My mother took in other people's laundry and cleaned other people's houses for less than a living wage. - That's not what it was like. Your mother was a proud woman. - Yeah, I was proud, too and the families around here smugly tossed me a few coins. 50 cents for hoeing the garden, a quarter to wash out the milk cans. - That was the only way that we could help! Your mother wouldn't accept any charity, Jonathan! - Well neither will I. You're asking for pity here, Miss McCarthy? Well I'm sorry, I can't help you. - No, I'm not asking for pity! I just want those kids to stay in the only home they've ever known! - Well that is out of my hands. The land legally belongs to the power company now. I would suggest you take it up with their board. - Who do we call? - Try information. - They can't take the whole farm. My grandfather, he pulled out each stump by hand! My father, he built the house! - We'll figure out something. - How do I tell the children? - I'll call the power company and see if anything can be done. Meanwhile, you fax Jack the papers. - Okay. How can I tell those children they're losing the house? How do I do that? I gotta get home. - You want me to come with you? - Yeah, but I gotta tell them. I gotta do this alone. Alright, thanks. I still have three days left! I'll appreciate it if you'll get off my property! - You showed them, aunt Martha. - Hey guys, did you see this? That's what I think about that. - Can we stay? - I don't know. But the most important thing is us staying together. Let's go make some dinner, okay? And Amy this time I'll cook the potatoes. Michael upstairs? Okay. - 72 hours notice? Well then who can I talk to? Who is in charge? He's the one who suggested I call you. Okay, and when is she back from vacation? January, no, that is too late! Okay, thank you, goodbye. - Paige, what's going on? - I'm sorry Miss Parker. It's just very frustrating trying to find someone who can make a decision at the power company. - You have other things to do, Paige. - Okay. - Michael, don't you get it? Mom and dad are never coming home. And the power company, they're kicking us out of our home. - Leave him alone, at least he's happy. Aunt Martha, are they really going to kick us out? - Yeah, dad said he'd fight them all the way to the Supreme Court. - Well, I wish he was here. Nobody's been able to stop the power lines so far. They cut right through the Krem's farm, had to tear down the barn. And then the Hogans, they took the corn field and they had to sell out. - Where will we live? - I don't know, but God willing we'll find a place, okay? Just, kids just eat up, okay? Sam, come on. There's got to be something I can do to keep our farm. - I've been over the paperwork twice. Maybe if you'd come to me a month ago. But now, with eminent domain, they can take anything they want. - Yeah, I've heard all about eminent domain. - Look, your sister and John mortgaged this place to the hilt, there's nothing left there. Let me help you out, I can loan you some money. - Oh, Jack I'm not going to take any charity from you. But I would really value some legal advice. Who do I sue? - It's the old Martha, taking on the world. - Oh, I'm not as radical as I used to be, I promise. I have three kids to care for now and I just want to keep our farm is all. That's it, very small request. I always loved this spot. - Me too. You know every time I came back here to see ma and the farm I wanted to call you but, I never did, did I? - No, you didn't. Why was that? - For one thing, my wife wouldn't have liked it. But also, you know, what was I going to say? - Well I've got to focus on those kids, but I could use your help with all this legal stuff. Pro bono, of course. - You got it. I've got a hearing in San Francisco tomorrow. I've got to leave tonight, but I'll take all the paperwork with me, I promise. - Well you know where to find me. - If you think of anything else, give me a call at the office and I'll give you my private home phone. Goodbye, Martha. - Okay Michael, I'll see you soon. - Mr. Cooper? Adrienne, Adrienne Lange, we spoke on the phone. - Adrienne Lange, are you, are you Duke's little sister? - It's been a few years since anyone's called me Duke's little sister, but yes. - Well you're... - All grown up. - Yeah. - So you're interested in office space? - Well, I'm just looking, that's all. - Well, we're getting a strip mall with a sixplex cinema a couple blocks away. Opens in a month or so. - So this would be a prime location being close to the mall. - For a lawyer to hang his shingle. - Uh huh. - Have a look? - Okay. - Okay. You know this place used to be... - Yeah, the Riverton Times, I know. - Oh, sorry Jack, I'm so used to showing newbies around. You know this town better than I do. - Every Wednesday and Sunday when I was a kid I would get my papers out back there and I would pedal halfway across this county to deliver them. - Well, as you know, demand is high. But seeing that you're from around here, I'm sure you could work a good deal. - Let me think about it. - Okay, nice to meet you. - Nice to see you again. - Hey. - Hey! - How's Michael? - I dropped him off first thing this morning all smiles. - Sounds like him. Homework? - Yeah, I'm a little behind on my assessments. - Do you have time for coffee? - Uh, sure, why not? - I saw Jack yesterday. - And? - Well, there's got to be some way to fight the power company. - You and he talk? - Yeah, we talked. - How's apartment hunting? - Nothing. - Nothing at all? - Everything's either too expensive or too small. So what's your back up plan? - Win the lottery and live happily ever after. - Start off with the usual? - Rich uncles, aunts? - None that I know of. - Martha, Christmas is coming and the children are young enough to be placed in homes. At least in time for them to be... - I asked you here for support, not to concede defeat. - I know, I know but my job is to consider what might be best for everyone's future. - What's best is staying together. Those kids growing up in foster homes, well, they'll turn out like little criminals. - A foster home is not a death sentence. - Well tell that to the psychopaths who grow up in them. - I grew up in one. - Oh. Wow. I didn't know that, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. - You don't need to be sorry. I understand your feelings, but I don't think I'm a psychopath. - Nor do I, I'm sorry. - My third foster parents were very loving. They're my true parents. - I am never going to give up those kids, you understand me? - I'm glad to hear that. - Well, I gotta move them out to my place, the kids, on Saturday. - You know your place is too small. - Yeah, I do know that. It's just that I don't have a choice in the matter until I find somewhere bigger, do I? - They don't waste any time, do they? - They're like vultures waiting to feed on our carcasses. Do you know they already cut the electricity and the plumbing, too? - It'll work out, Martha. Somehow, it'll work out. - You know Robert, I try to believe that, but lately each day is worse than the day before. It is so frustrating. I mean, it's 10 days til Christmas and they couldn't let us stay? Y'all have a merry Christmas, you hear? - It's not them, Martha. They're just doing their job. In my job I see a lot of misery. Martha you have to think of this as a tragedy like a tornado or a hurricane. Don't waste any time on hate. Try to, you know, get on with your life. - I know. - Now, how can I pitch in? - Aren't you on duty? - I'm always on duty. Sarah. Go ahead. - I'll be out helping Martha move for the next hour or so. Roger that. - Oh, my. You know Michael was 41 inches just a week ago. That's a good idea. This is awful. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. - I'll be outside. - Oh Susan, I'm so glad you're not here to see this. Hello. - Martha, I picked up Michael. - Hey, how's he doing? - He's fine, but Martha, Miss Parker's on her way over to your place right now. - Now? - You might want to clean up a little. - Oh, my gosh. Alright, thank you, bye. Miss Parker's coming over right now. We gotta, we gotta clean up really quickly, you guys. Quickly, quickly! Come on! Miss Parker? - I'm here to do the guardianship assessment. - Yeah, Paige mentioned something about that. - Have I come at a bad time? - No, no, good time. Come on in. - I know the guardian will be relieved, as I am, to know that Michael's okay. Thank you, doctor. - So how did we do? - Well it's not a contest, Miss McCarthy. I'll forward my assessment to Miss Holloway and she'll be in touch. Michael's back! - Doctor says the best therapy is to be with his siblings. - Thanks for bringing the little boy home. - Hi Michael, how was it? Hey, Michael. - Come on. - Did you have fun? - Come here, you. So how was it, huh? How was it, did they teach you to talk yet? - I'd like the doctor's full report on my desk in the morning. - Well? - In the morning Miss Holloway, in the morning. - Look at them, they're such good kids. - Yeah, your sister sure did something right raising them. - Yeah, she was the domestic one. I was always the wild one. Paige do you think I'm making a mistake? - A mistake? - Yeah, I mean I know I'm really trying to fulfill my sister's wishes for the kids, I know that. But maybe I'm just too selfish to face the facts. - I would hardly characterize taking three kids into your life as selfish. - No, I don't mean that, like, in a material way, but maybe in a spiritual way. I mean I just feel like the world is giving me punches and I'm not getting the message. - Martha, my biological mother abandoned me two days after I was born. I went to live with an aunt til I was, I was Michael's age. But she was over 70 when I was born. Things got to where she just couldn't cope anymore she was too old and weak. So, here I was this little girl, cooking and cleaning up after her. - Wow, I had no idea. - Well it didn't seem so bad to me at the time. But then one day a social worker came to my school. Before she got to my class I could see her through the window. She was holding my favorite doll in her hand. I knew then. Anyway, a moment later there was a knock at the door and I never saw my auntie or my home again. - Oh, Paige. - I hated my first foster home, it was like a prison. And the second was even worse. But my third family was wonderful and they adopted me. But, I would give anything to see my auntie again. - Wow. - Paige dear, can you come in here? - Coming, Miss Parker. - I want you to drop the McMurrin case. - Drop it? - Now, I'm suggesting this for your own good. - I can't drop it, I need to see it through. - Through til what, Miss Holloway? - Through til I... - Paige, this family's situation will likely not have a happy ending. Are you certain you can continue? - 100 percent, I'm certain. - Should the time come to take custody of these children could you do it? - Miss Parker, especially since there's a chance I may have to place those kids in a home, I want to keep this case. They're going to need me even more. - I'm sure your daughter will love it. I had a doll like that as a little girl. Thanks again. - Rough day? - Well they're all sort of rough. - Assessment. I need to sit down. Okay. - You get full marks on emotional support. You squeaked by on financial ability. But... - But what? Hey, after what I've been through I can take it. - Martha you, I mean, we have five days to find you suitable accommodations. - Five days? - Proper housing is a state regulation and five days is the longest reprieve that Miss Parker could legally grant. - Five days, this is ludicrous. Martha, I know things are going slowly here, but I will certainly guarantee you an advance on your salary or... - No, no, Roger thank you so much, it's very kind, but I've already looked at everything in town and there's nothing. - Well, Miss McCarthy, what can we do for you today? - Well, okay I'm desperate. I have to find a place to live for me and the kids before December 24th or else the state will come and take them away to a foster home. You're the only person that I could turn to. - That little place of yours seems cozy enough. - Not for the children. - What do you expect me to do? Wave my magic wand and solve all the world's problems? - No, I was hoping you'd give me a loan so I could build an addition. - A loan? - Yeah, that's what banks are for, right? - Okay. What's your collateral? - Well, I promise to pay it back. I won't need much, just eight or 10,000 is all. - As much as I might like to help, the bank can't loan money without it being secured against something tangible; land, bonds, investments. The freeloading farmers around here would suck me dry in a week if I started handing them unsecured cash. - I have a car that's almost paid for. - Miss McCarthy, let's not waste your time any further. To be perfectly blunt you are too high a risk for any financial institution to consider. And with custody of your sister's children you're only becoming a higher risk. - Jonathan, I'm desperate, please, for the sake of those kids. Please. - The world is not a nice place. And the sooner those children accept that fact, the better. I mean, look at me. I lost my home, I lost my mother. I had nobody and nothing. And today, well. - Yeah, yeah, you're the richest man in the county. The question is, would your mother be proud of you now? I rather doubt it. Goodbye, Jonathan. - Damn thing won't start. It just won't start. - That's the cupola that grand daddy built. - Daddy says that's where the angels live. Do you think they could hear us if we pray? I think so. - Please help us find a way to stay with aunt Martha. - And if there's a Supreme Court in heaven, could you ask them to help us keep our home? - Anyway, we could sure use your help, amen. Let's go! - Michael, what are you doing? Sam, is our house still standing? - Yeah, but not for long, as soon as they get that machine running. It's called a bulldozer, dummy. Oh. - Hello. Jack. - Martha, what is it? - Hey, listen, uh, is there any way that we can move our house? - What do you mean, move the house? Oh. - Jack! - Wait, wait a minute, I'm thinking it through now. - Well? - The previous owner has salvage rights. The bank has been paid in full so there's no lien on it. So yes, Martha, I think the house is yours to move, yes. - Thank you, thank you, thank you! - What is it? What are you guys talking about? - It's just an idea. Shh, Sam. - Where will you move it to? - Here, my place. - Martha, you know, that might work. Hey, do you remember Larry Clark from high school? He used to work with a pro house moving company. I'll give him a call, see if he can help. - Well, Roy's got a flatbed. - Volunteers, yeah, that's what we need, volunteers. - We? - What? - You said we. - Well, I'm getting excited for you, I'll do anything I can to help you. - Thank you, Jack. Goodnight. - Aunt Martha, what's up? - We are going to move our house right where she sits to over here. It's been done, people move houses, it's not unthinkable. - Hey, what are you doing? Keep this filth off of my car! - You guys need to get to bed, we have a long day tomorrow. Yes, aunt Martha. Goodnight. - Okay, that's all I need to know, thank you. Sheriff got the permits, he'll be able to block the road for two hours. - Really? I don't believe it. God this is really going to happen, isn't it? - This time tomorrow you'll all have your home. - Should I wake Sam? - No, let him sleep, it's going to be a long day. - You really think we can move the house? - I don't see why not. It's like an old-fashioned barn raising. - A what? - Well, when I was young folks would pitch in and contribute whatever they could to an old-fashioned barn raising. They'd bring food or tools or equipment and everybody would pitch in. - Everyone? - Yeah, back then folks seemed to care more about their neighbors seems like. - Things sure have changed. - Hopefully not too much. - The people are the same, just the goodness is further down inside. - We'll find out soon enough, won't we? Hopefully, we'll need a lot of sandwiches today. - Stop, stop, stop! The whole town is coming at 10 o'clock to move this house from this property to mine. It's all in the works. - You must be kidding? - No, I'm not kidding. - This is a legal demolition order. - I know, but you can't tear this house down. - You're going to move it? Okay guys, okay, at ease. She going to move it. - What's the problem? - No problem, everything's fine. Help me set up the coffee and sandwiches, people should be here any minute. - The way I see it, if we move the house, your crew can go home for the holidays. - Me and the guys, we get to go home for the holidays early? - That's good, Michael. Carry that, put it on the table. Nobody's to eat any of these sandwiches, okay? We're going to need plenty of sandwiches and coffee when everybody shows up. - I thought I'd be late. - Nobody's showing up. - Just relax, Martha. - Where are they? Look, they're arriving. - Hey you guys, I need cribbing on all four corners, okay? Hey Martha, I'm sorry to be so late. My dad's old rig needed a little coaxing this morning, that's all. - That thing's been sitting in the field rusting for 10 years, hasn't it? God, were you up all night fixing it? - No, no just a little while. Alright, hey you guys we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it, come on let's get going. We gotta go, you guys ready? Wow! Let's get going! - Okay, where do we start? Wow, any of the corners, come on, you. - Just a little bit, watch the window. - Okay, Jack, more on your side. - Alright. - Okay, fella, just hand me up one of those, please. That's exactly it. I'll need the other in a second here. - Keep going. Easy, easy, easy. - Ow! Okay, I got both jacks into the north side of the house, we're ready to go. - Hey, one more, alright, I think this is level. What do you think? - Yeah, yeah, that looks good. - Okay. - Let's go around the other side, come on. Okay you guys, ready? We're going to move it on one, right? One! - Jack, Jack, it's not going to work. - What do you mean it's not going to work? Look Bob, we're going to have this house moving in three or four hours tops. - No, I just drove the route. The house won't clear the power lines. - What power lines? - There are power lines across the highway just about a half mile before Martha's house. There's no way, there's no way. - Well, we'll get somebody to cut 'em down, Bob, move 'em. - I had Sarah call the power company. - What'd she say? Is it gonna work? - What's wrong? - Martha, it's the power lines. The ones across the highway just before your place. - Bob, we'll get somebody to take 'em down just until we can roll the house over them, that's easy. - The lines run directly right off the damn turbines. You cut them off, the entire town goes dark on Christmas Eve. - Oh no, no, I'm sorry, but we have come too far to turn back now. - I'm sorry, Martha. I can't find anybody at the power company who's willing to take responsibility for shutting the power off to half the county just to move a house. - No, no, no, Jack, there's gotta be something we can do. There's got to be. - Wait, wait, wait, I gotta make a call, I'll be right back. - My gosh, Martha, what is it? - Oh, it's those power lines, I'm so sick of them! The power lines by my house are too low, so the house won't fit under them. - What are you talking about? Where are the kids? - Oh, Jack said it was too dangerous so I sent them over to Lois Krem's. - Hey Martha, Martha! We can move the house. We can move the house to my mother's farm with her blessings. She's got plenty of land and no power lines. - Jack, it'll have to be a permanent location. - Let's make it permanent. Look, what do you say, Martha? Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Come on, let's get going, we've gotta get this done! Hey you guys, let's go, we can get it done now! - Jack, we're moving a house, a house! Damn straight, we are! I gotta admit though, I had some doubts. - Oh, big city lawyer, doubts. - I'm just a country boy at heart. - Jack, we can only block the road for another 30 minutes. - That's plenty of time. - Okay. - Martha. - We're moving the house! - All is well in the world! - Jack! I'm so excited. A little more. Okay, here! - Okay, let's get the blocks under the house. Houston, we've got contact. - Paige Holloway! - Miss Parker, isn't it wonderful? - Paige, it's wonderful indeed, but look at the state requirements. These are the minimum requirements. Toilet facilities, drinking water, heat, electricity, the basics. - We can accomplish all this in a few days, Miss Parker. - It's a mandatory requirement before occupancy, not after. - This isn't going to be easy. - That's because against my wishes, you got personally involved. - Just give us one hour. You guys, you guys! - What? - Miss Parker says that the house needs heat, water, electricity and a working toilet by 6pm or the kids can't stay here. - You've got to be kidding me? - Otherwise the house isn't an acceptable residence. - This woman just doesn't stop. - Let me talk to her. Miss Parker, excuse me. - Martha can reapply for custody after New Years, once the house is fixed up and given a certificate of occupancy. - Come on, there's gotta be some way we can keep this family together, at least for Christmas. - The regulations are clear. This house is not suitable for the children, not even temporarily. I've told Paige you have one hour and I'm sticking to it. - Fine, okay, we'll work something out. Guys, guys listen up. Nobody's going to split up this family. Ned, do you have a generator at home? - Well yeah, it hasn't been run for a while, Jack. - Well, go get it, go get it and get a bunch of extension cords. Hell or high water, we'll make it work. You got it. - I've got a water cooler and some cases of bottled water at my house. - Yeah, bring them and what about a propane heater? - Yeah. - Get that, too, good. - Okay. - Think she'll go for it? - You know, technically, if there's water in the house, even if it's bottled, and electric, however limited, and a heater, even if it's a portable, and a toilet, technically, no violations. - Oh, I hope you're right. She probably just needs a face-saving way out. - Yeah, well let's give her one, huh? You think you can track down a chemical toilet? - I saw one, construction site just down the road. - Go get it. - I'm all over it. - You're kidding. - It's going to work, I'm telling you, don't worry. - See, if Ned's got a generator over there, I'm telling you, this'll work. Here. And Roger Jenkin, here we go, he's got this heater. Yeah. - And a lot of water, right, Roger? Hey, look at the sheriff. - Jack, the damn generator won't start. - Oh, you're kidding. - It won't catch, I'm sorry. - Alright, never mind, I got another idea, come on. - I'm sorry, Martha. - What's wrong? - It's too late, the house isn't acceptable without electricity. I have to take the kids. - You can't take the kids. Jack's working on something right now, he's on it. - Please, don't make this harder than it already is. - Look, it's mom and dad's light! - You know you told that you were going to help us stay together as a family. You promised! - I'm just doing my job. - These kids are mine, now, do you understand me? - Dad said that's where the angels live. - Martha the rules are clear. The kids need to come with me now. - Really? Over my dead body! - I'll take over, Paige. It's alright, Miss Holloway, I said I'll take over from here. Uh, Miss McCarthy, do you know anything about those Christmas lights? - Susan and John put them up there on the same day that they had their car accident. - I see, they seem to be electric. - Yeah, yeah, they are. - I'm sure Paige told you the rules concerning the house. You know I'm duty bound to act in the best interests of the children. Under the circumstances, the law is very clear. I have no choice but to certify this house as habitable for you and three young children. Merry Christmas, Miss McCarthy. Merry Christmas to you, too, Miss Parker. - No exceptions? - I trust those lights are electric as Miss McCarthy claims. You're right, a good social worker knows when to follow her heart. Merry Christmas, Paige. - I'm sorry. I know I let you down. - You know we wouldn't even be standing here if it weren't for your help. I understand. - Look! Whoa! - It doesn't say who it's from. - Open it up, maybe there's a note. - Yeah. I told mom I wanted this. How did you know, aunt Martha? I never told anyone else. - Yeah, how'd you know? - You guys, I didn't buy these presents. - Look! - Hey, hey Michael. There you go, man, I got ya. Atta boy, go get it! - Remember the collection jar from the coffee shop? Tada! - Did you two bring those presents? - Not me, no I had to rewire the old rig. Some jerk blew the electrical system. - Paige? - No, after I left here I wrote assessments all night. - Oh well, I don't believe either one of you, but thank you. - Brought you a little something, Martha. - It may be too late for the words I never said seven years ago. - But I hope it's not too late for us. - Are you going to be my mommy and daddy? - Absolutely. - Martha, I think I'm finally home. - I think we all are.
