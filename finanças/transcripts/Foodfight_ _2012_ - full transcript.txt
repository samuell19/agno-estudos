(siren wailing) (hamsters grunting) Listen up, Fat Cat Burglar, I'm giving you one last chance to hand 'em over before I cash in your coupons for you. It is you, the great Dex Dogtective, who's about to take a fall. Or should I say be pushed? (hamsters grunting) If I had a raisin for every time I've heard that one. Exterminate him. (hamsters grunting) Hey, hairless hamsters, want some of this? Huh? Huh? (exclaims) Huh? Huh? (screams) Get it! Cheese! Cheese! Uh-oh. (all screaming) My mother would be so ashamed. Okay, it's just you and me, Fat Cat. Now, fork over the little guys and no one gets hurt. Never! I'm sending you to the cooler, Burglar. I'm gonna kill you! No, no, stop. You wouldn't. I just want to be loved. Is that so wrong? (kittens mewing) (cheering and applause) WOMAN: Dex, Dex, Dex, darling. Hedda Shopper here. This makes 500 consecutive cases you've solved as head of the United Supermarket Defense Association. What's your secret, darling? (hamster yelling) The secret's inside. (screams) (grunts) The real secret is, I am scared out of my mind, Dan. Tonight's the night. Aw, no worries. You can do it as long as you got me to help you. Did I mention me? What do you think? Whoa, what the...? You got four carrots! What did you do, rob the food bank? Yeah, but do you think she'll like it? What if she doesn't like it? Relax, bro, we're talking about Sunshine Goodness. You could give her a Cracker Jack ring and she'd still say yes. Everything's got to be just... perfect tonight. Now, you sure you know what do to? Who you think you're talking to? Come on. I'm your best friend Daredevil Dan, the most stunt-flying, death-defying chocolate ike... Dan, Dan, Dan. One more thing. Will you be my best man? (voice breaking): This, this is... (sobbing) You, you bet your box top. You my man. CHILD: Sunshine, over here! Good kick. Way to go, buddy! - Throw me the ball! Throw me the ball! Oh, you guys are doing great. Yay, Sunshine! SUNSHINE: You're melonball superstars. CHILD: Over here, Sunshine! Hey, Sunshine, over here! Catch it! (laughter) Aw, okay, you little ikes, b-bye! Thank you, Sunshine! See you tomorrow! Thanks for playing with us. Oh, Danny, that was so nice of you. (groaning) It was? Of course. The way you saved Dex from that melonball? That's what friends are for, right? (laughs) Dude's lost a step, for real. Hungry, tough guy? Hiya, kitten. How about we get Chef Boyardee to make us a huge, feastumongous dinner, my treat? Oh, pizza, great idea! Hey, I'll take an extra... Gotta fly. See you later, Danny. Sunshine... Or we could play stickball with Mr. Clean. Well, uh, actually, I scanned-- er, I mean, planned plumthing-- er, something special tonight. Hmm, let me guess: a romantic hot air balloon ride perhaps. Oh, no, you just did that. Was it scary up there with those itsy-bitsy hairless hamster henchmen? I would have tussled with them myself. Really? Don't believe me? Listen, Sherlock, just 'cause every ike in town relies on you to protect them doesn't mean that I couldn't kick your butt. Any time. (laughs) You want some? Oh, yeah. Aw, it warms my heart the way you love my raisins, tough guy. (laughs) Why, Mr. Dogtective, are you sweeping me off my feet? I'm working on it. (Sunshine laughs) SUNSHINE: Dex. All right, your table's ready. We's got caviar, filets mignons, and an outstanding array of fruits and vegetables. Stay away from the Brussels sprouts. And-- forget about it... for dessert, we got-- Mmm, ice cream, my favorite. You want a lick? Yes-- n-n-no, no. Oh, Dex, this is so great. (playing loudly) Sunshine, you mean the world... What?! You mean the world to me! Maximillius! - Hey, I likes you, too. Oh, youse means her. I just want to take care of you, baby. I do feel so safe in your arms and I'm so proud of you, Dex, but I worry when you're on a dangerous case. I'll be fine. Have to be to make sure nothing bad ever happens to you. Always, Dex? Forever, kitten. Here goes. Sunshine, would you...? Takes cover, dollface, boss! (screaming) He's going to crash again! It looks like Danny's drawing a picture. Of us! That's so cute! But what's he trying to draw on your hand? What I've been trying to ask you all night! Oh, no! He's not gonna try to... Just got to loop-de-loop to make the engagement ring. For frying out loud, you've never made the loop-de-loop! DAN: No problem 'cause I'm gonna dare the day and... Fly away! Come on, Danny! You can do it this time! Sunshine, will you...? Dare the day and... (yelling) Not today. I better go check on Danny just to make sure he's okay. I'm sure he's fine. Dan always crashes. Like, yesterday, for example, and the day before, and... When in doubt, just do the right thing, and it'll always turn out. But I was trying to ask you... Don't worry. It'll just be a minute. Save my ice cream. I'll be right back, okay? I don't understand it. Sunshine went to check on you right after the crash. No, I told you, dawg. I didn't crash. I just... - That was hours ago. Where is she? Come on, man. You know Sunshine. Sweetest ike in the Marketropolis. She probably ran into a friend who needed her help. Why didn't I just do it? Come on, it's getting late. I mean, early. You know our rules. We got to be out of sight before the market opens! We can't let the people see us. But I never got to ask her to walk down the aisle with me. Chill, dawg! You can pop the question tomorrow night. Don't worry. It ain't like it's the last time you're ever gonna see Sunshine again. (sighs) Sunshine, baby. (truck engine chugging) (engine chuffing) (low growling) May I help you? You must be Leonard, the manager. I'm your new Brand X representative. I wasn't expecting any new products. Corporate picked your store to test the new Brand X detergent with elixir! Brand X, huh? Never heard of it. Give us one week! Your cu... cu-cu... cu-cu... customers won't know how they lived without Brand X. Well, everything is so nice the way it is. We don't have space. Oh. (laughs) I'll make space. (laughs) Wait until you get a... (sniffs) ...whiff of our Brand X elixir! It's practically addictive. (groaning) That was a perfectly good bag of chips. Survival of the fittest, Leonard! Never opened. Never enjoyed. KRISPY: No one wastes me chips and gets away with it. Brand X will pay! Argh! SUNSHINE: Dex! Sunshine! Help me, Dex! Please find me! Please, Dex! I'll find you, Sunshine! Don't leave me! Sunshine! Dex! Sunshine! Dex! Dex. Where are you? Save me, Dex! I'll find you, Sunshine! I love you, Dex! I hope you find me. (yells) (Dan sings) Come on, Dex! Up and at 'em! Wake up, buddy! Wake up! - (clears throat) Hey, pal. You were having the nightmare again, weren't you? Buddy, look, I miss her, too. But, dude, it's been six months. Sunshine's gone, bro. We got to accept it. (sighs) I can't. I failed her. Yo, it wasn't your fault! You-you kept this place running smooth as a smoothie and all of us safe! Just look at all these articles talking about all the millions of cases you solved. Oh, yeah? What about these? "Raisin Riddle a Mystery!" "Leads Dry as Prunes." "Sunshine Goodness Gone Without a Trace!" "Dex Dogtective Hangs Up His Hat." The only case that ever really mattered, and I couldn't solve it. Now, she's gone. (sighs) Sunshine. My only Sunshine. Ok, so your detective days are over, kaput. But now, brother, you've got a club to run! And you can bet the CopaBanana's gonna be buzzing tonight! Everybody's gonna be talking about how Krispy's bag got crunched! Anyway, you want a lift? I got my wings right outside. Fly with you?! I'm sad, but I'm not crazy. Okay, you cool? See you tonight. Yeah, thanks, pal. (door opens and closes) (clack) Whoa!

(disc scratches) Crying over spilled milk? What are you doing here? (disc shattering) I've got a hot case for you. I'm looking for a guy. About your height. Same great build. Same strong jaw. Only difference is, this guy isn't living in the past. (sniffing) I... I can't help you. Holy chips. Maybe I can help you get a clean start on a new relationship. (sniffing) So, what happened to Dan? You already eat through to his hollow center? He said the sugars and salts were gonna finish what they started. The aisles aren't safe tonight for a helpless lady... ...like me. Sorry, I'm not buying this damsel-in-distress routine. You've been through the wash plenty. I can see it in your eyes. You're right, Dex. I'm not new. Last year, I was... recalled. But I'm changed now. New ingredients, repackaged with a fresh scent, I want to forget my past just like you do. I can't forget. Oh, but you're wrong, Dex. (sniffing) I can wash away your memories. (screaming) Wait! I haven't shown you my secret ingredient. The secret's inside. Oh, why did I agree to run the United Supermarket Defense Association? Things were so much smoother when Dex was in charge. Oh, Dex, Dex, thank goodness you're here. The salts and sugars. Oh, it must mean all-out war. How many ikes went down? Everybody we threw out of the friggin' Banana. Dan and Lady X is the only ones missing. And the lady's got an alibi. Dex and I were just talking. I warned him there might be trouble. We all knows when a product loses its icon, it spoils, it goes bad. So, whats can we do here? Nothing. We're the soul of our products. Without us, they're gone real fast. Oh, just... These ikes didn't expire in a rumble. Somebody just wants it to look that way. Are you saying what I thinks youse is saying? Rigamoldis has set in. Looks like all these poor ikes were rubbed out. Oh, but why, how, who? Dan. He said he was gonna get back at the salts. - Oh, goodness gracious. Dan would never do anything like this. We have to find him before the rest of the salts do. Then you better start styling, Harry. Right. What? Me? I can't. Oh, you have to help me, Dex, before I go bald. Not that bald isn't beautiful. I don't get involved anymore. After losi'' Sunshine, boss, I thought youse would never smile again. But, Dan, he was there for youse. M-my split ends. What to do? Oh, no. Nothing harder than seeing good food go bad. (laughs sinisterly) Looks like we arrived just in time. DEX: Brand X replacements for every ike lost last night. Now, how'd that Mr. Clipboard guy know? Something's wrong. Danny's in trouble. I just know it. I let you down, Sunshine. I just can't throw in the paper towel on Dan. He was your best friend, too. (gavel banging) I call this session of the United Supermarket Defense Association to order! (crowd clamoring) The USDA must come to order! Why is everyone screaming?! This only concerns the sugars and the salts! Not anymore. General X, our esteemed potato chip icon, has just discovered a diabolical plot against cleaning product ikes. Security around here is down the Drano. And who is behind this vicious plan? Who?! Oh, boy. - A specialty ike. Kung Tofu! But I, Kung Tofu, am innocent! Everything's out of control! What are we going to do? Well, (shrieks) Brand X is 30 strong now. This is our new home. We want to help. Why not let my ikes maintain order in the aisles? Why you? Dex Dogtective always mopped up our troubles, capisce? Let's get him to come back! He quit, but I will never give up because I care what happens to each and every ike of you. (crowd murmuring) But it's so dangerous. Don't cry for me, Charlie Tuna. Trust me, Brand X will make everything better. You have my promise. We will take care of you. But what about Dex? Oh, we'll take care of him, too. (whimpering) The lady wants the dogtective. Perhaps he's been very, very bad. No problem. If you weren't so desperately deficient with your coupon dispersals. Or I could just kill you. That would be lots of fun. More fun than a spanking. The dogtective will be dropped off at the cleaners, posthaste. Speaking of clean, might I interest you in a toothbrush? (groans) I fear this will not end happily... for me. (descending whistling) (tires screeching, metallic crashing) (footsteps) CHEASEL: Everybody seems to be searching for the flying squirrel. Mayhaps a reward for the reckless rodent would be in the offing. If you've got something up that slimy sleeve, spill the beans. Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don't. I seem to be suffering from a touch of train-induced amnesia. Trix are for kids, Cheasel. Last night, I saw the chocolate furball heading towards the detergent aisle. You know, home of the lovely Lady X. When? Right after the screaming started. Most suspicious. No way. I know Dan. He'd never leave the scene of a crime. Not even for a hot dish like Lady X. But this dish is extra spicy. It just doesn't add up. Wait, wait. May I suggest a calculator? Lucky for you, I just happened to have procured a boatload of fine... (clicking, whirring) (descending whistling) Pain, she's like an old friend. (loud bang) (gulps) Ah... Note to self... (muffled): need new friend. I still got it. (grunts) And I thought the raisins were humiliating. (sniffing) LADY X: Dex, sorry I'm not dressed. I wasn't expecting company. I'd say things are going exactly how you expected. (tango playing) How about joining me in a warm rinse? I'm not that dirty. Oh, but being filthy can be loads of fun. Don't you think so, Dex? There are some stains you can never wash out. Let's try. I want to scrub your bubbles, Dex. I want to know how you rubbed out all those ikes last night. Me? But I was with you, remember? Yeah. Trying to get me on the case before there even was one. BIRD: Poop on her head. Aim for the hair. Naughty dog. I've really been on your mind, haven't I? (vase clanks, electrical crackling) You've orchestrated this dance from the start. I think you hijacked Dan and you've got him squirreled away somewhere. My friend better be alive or you're gonna check out of this store the hard way. Your crash dummy's fine... for now. But he won't be unless you back Brand X. So that's your game. We could run this store, Dex. An aisle all to ourselves, packed tight, no markdowns for us. I could be your Sunshine. There will never be another Sunshine. Now I'm taking you in. Not before I solve your case for you. Down, boy. (grunts) What a shame. We could've been like macaroni and cheese, peanut butter and jelly, Scotch and tape. DAN: Dex, wake up! Come on, Dex, wake up! Dan? Dex, my man! I knew you'd sniff me out. You okay, pal? Is your chocolate chipped? It was brutal. She has these... these giant flying mother X-o-bytes that slaughtered every ike in sight. But they didn't rub me out because Lady X digs my fine flavor and oh-so-sweet bod. Or... maybe she used you as bait to get to me? Oh, like you're the only ike who could rescue me, figure out her game, and shut her down. Uh... Oh, yeah, you are. Not even the great Dex Dogtective can save you now. (maniacal laughter) (gasps) Dex, is it just me or is it hot in here? After they've enjoyed the extra-hot dry cycle, dump their bodies in the toothpaste aisle. They frame toothpaste now? Everyone knows toothpastes hate sugars. We're done soft-soaping. Frame everybody! From spray starch to sliced salami, from calories to carbs! Then Brand X will step in and replace them all. It'll be a cakewalk. We're taking over, so get out there and show 'em who's running this store! (grunts) But, I, Kung Tofu, am innocent! What's that got to do with it? I don't get it. I don't understand. I mean, we simply don't care. I am hot. Hot, hot, hot. Gonna fry. Gonna crisp. Stay calm. We just gotta find a way to get out. It's not natural. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. If we just breathe and focus, the answer will come. (grunts) What?! I'm melting and you're getting all martial art Zen? You can put a... Sock! Socks! That's it! Socks always escape from the dryer. Follow that sock! (Dan yells) (grunting) Ow! (grunts) Ouch. Okay, pal, you're safe now. Yo, yo, yo, wait, whoa, time out. Where you going? Look, Dan, I just came to find you, but that's it. I don't... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't want to get involved no more-- got it, check-- but you might want to take a look at this first. What the fudge? They're building an entire army of robotic X-o-bytes! What's that oily liquid? Yo, I seen that. It's the same stuff they shot at the Krispy and the other ikes when they rubbed them out. They must be planning to finish what they started last night. Brand X is gonna take over the entire store! Come on! Let's get 'em! I'm ready to roll! You with me? Let's hit this! I ain't afraid. Well, I am. You are?! R-Really? Why? You don't understand. I don't know if I can cut the mustard anymore. Yo, Dex, you gotta believe in yourself. If Sunshine were here, she would. You know, I do have an idea. Ah, now that's more like it. Dex Dogtective is back in the house. But it's really, really, really dangerous. Wh-Wh... Wh-Wh... Hold up. How come you said "really" three times? I never heard you say that. I've heard "really dangerous" and "really, really," but this is three times. Come on, pal. Let's snap, crackle and pop out of here. (over speakers): Attention all icons. Curfew is now in effect. Only Brand X officials are permitted in the aisles. All violators will be punished. I do so hope there are violators. I love a good violation. I love anything to do with violation. (laughing) (Dan grunting) Watch it now. What is going on? We need you to analyze this. I borrowed it from Lady X. I think it's the secret ingredient in the Brand X Elixir. Brand X! Oh, Brand X! Oh, why me? Why?! Why Brand X? Come on, come on. Why not, uh, let's see... Dr. Pepper, Dr. Scholl's, Dr. Feelgood! Anybody but me! - Doc, Doc, Doc, snap out of it. You're the only one with a nose for the job. (sneezes) Ew! Oh, this is just great! Okay, I'll give it a whiff. It can't be done. Oh, oh, why me? Wh-What's going on? We have reports that you're plotting against sugars. Me?! I don't even have fluoride! I'm just a whitener! Well, you know, I myself, appreciate a good darkener. (laughing) (whirring) NOSE (stammering): Oh, no, no, that's not right. That's odd. That's definitely odd. My olfactor meter can't, uh, can't fully identify the main ingredient. Oh, no, this I can tell you. The Brand X Elixir is toxic to humans. Toxic?! Oh, and highly addictive. Oh, addictive! (snaps fingers) Addictive? Okay, so that explains why customers are buying up Brand X products like crazy. How can we regular icons compete against... a-against this irresistible elixir? We can't. Won't be long and the whole store will be X. And the rest of us discontinued. Oh, but there's so many noses left to blow! - Oh, man. - I'm too young to be discontinued. I never even got a chance to play Lick the Icing with Sweet Cakes. If we could just get this info to our market's corporate headquarters, they'd have to recall Brand X. How could you possibly reach them? You couldn't. You... E-mail. From Mr. Leonard's computer. But it's in the expiration station, at the other end of the store. No, you'd never make it there before the supermarket opens. You couldn't! You could try, but you can't reach 'em! Do you understand what I'm saying? Impossible! Then we cross during the day. Daytime?! No one has ever done that. Are you crazy?! What about all those humans out there? The ones with the big feet. They're never supposed to squash... I mean, see us during the daytime. We'll be killed! But not that I can't handle that, because I can. 'Cause I'm a natural ninja. We won't survive another night against Brand X. It's our only shot. (screaming): It's daytime...! Oh, daytime! Oh, this is bad! We must've lost hundreds of ikes last night. Come on, pal. Let's get going before we lose any more. Oh, how the Jell-O are we supposed to cross over ten aisles of that? If the next thing you hear is, "Clean up on aisle one," you know we blew it. The next thing you're going to hear to be the sound of me eating you for the lunch. (mocking) "The next thing you're gonna hear is the sound of me eating you for lunch." (laughs) Look, you overstocked, overstuffed lunch lizard, my friend Dex, he'll make you stutter with your butter. You won't survive his chives. DEX: Are you crazy? She's huge! Let's strawberry jam out of here. (screams) (baby jabbering) No, Larry, I am not buying that for you. (Dan whimpers) (screams) (grunts) Miss me? (laughs) Wait, wait, stop. (stammers) We could, you know, maybe try to date a bit. A... a movie? A lunch? I kill you! Dex! Batter up, fool! (Dan laughs) Where you go, my chipmunk? - DAN: I love you! Dare the day! Mayday! Mayday! (Dan whimpers) DEX: Polar! You need to warn the other ikes. Brand X is behind the rubout. (Dan screams) Bring as many ikes as you can to the Banana tonight! And, thanks, Polar! That's what friends are for. DAN: Wait. Wait, okay. MAN (over P.A.): The store is now closed. We ain't gonna make it. We ain't gonna make it. Trust me. I mean, I'm no math major or anything, but we're going to hit the door. - We'll be fine. No way! We're going to hit! - We'll make it! I'm here. My arms, my arms. (laughing) Oh, see? See? I told you we'd make it. You didn't want to listen to me, right? We the bug bomb, bro! We... What? Yo, I never should've tried to chip-slap Krispy. You can't blame yourself, Dan. It's the... X-o-byte! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! What, are you crazy? You hit someone up here! You think it's duck season? Do I look like a mallard? Hold on, hold the line. (sniffing) Is that the enticing scent of rich, creamy chocolate? Are you chocolate? Are you made of chocolate? Really? That is so sweet. Hi. Whoa! (thud) Vlad Chocool, chocolate vampire. Used to have cards. (laughs) Do you work out? I use the ThighMaster. You're looking pretty good for biting it. Excuse me, but they poisoned me like the other ikes, okay? It's not my fault... Again with this. What can I tell you? I am the undead. All right? The undead. No, you're not dead, but you're not exactly living, either. Sort of like being in summer school. (chuckles) Oh, come on, that's funny. Now, that's funny. Let's not lose our senses of humor. (over speakers): Mandatory security rally, tonight. All icons must attend or face the penalty of elimination! FEMALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE: How can I help? Upload? Download? Scan? Blue, we're gonna get corporate to recall Brand X. Can you bring up a form? Wait, don't tell me... (inhales sharply) bittersweet. Do you go out much, by the way? 'Cause I like to dance a little myself. I dance a bit. (stammers) This instant glue will seal their tomb. Lovely word, "tomb." (laughing maniacally) (glue gurgling) (sniffs) Loony Glue. They're locking us in. What? In here? W-With him? Hey, hey, hey, hey, back off! I'll work with Blue, you fly around and check for loose vent grates. DAN: Have you flipped your flapjacks? CHOCOOL: Anyone have glasses they don't need? DAN: Would you fly straight?! - (both grunt) Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh, golly, that hurt. Uh-huh, yeah, good. (sighs) Good plan. (bones cracking) Maybe we'll just dent our way out of here. Ow! Maybe my eyes aren't that good, but if you would just let me lead. Well, the phrase isn't "blind as an eagle," is it? No, it's "blind as a bat." What do you think I am? And with you on my back yet. Not that I mind that. Scanning forms. Only two recalls on file. "Priscilla Pusley's genetically gigantic prunes." DAN: What kinda fool needs a bigger prune? CHOCOOL: We coming up to something? (both grunting) Nobody. Priscilla had the worst sales in store history. Okay, I guess I'll be the bad guy once again and say what everyone's thinking. She's also hideous. No, I mean, come on, she's very unattractive because she-she's a prune. What do we expect from her? Why are we shy about these things? Be what you are, that's what I say. In her case it's... horrible. BLUE: And here is the other recall. S-Sunshine recalled? Who ordered it? -No name. Address only. Same location as Priscilla Pusley's recall. That's impossible. Sunshine and Priscilla had different manufacturers. Blue, run a search on that address against all the manufacturers on file. Brand X ordered both the recalls. Dex, I just don't get it. Brand X took my Sunshine away. Easy, easy, bro. I know how you feel. No, no one can, not even you. Okay, but, look, you got to stay focused or Brand X is gonna take everything else you love, too. Not while I'm still breathing. Blue, we have to send a form to recall all of Brand X's products. Pull the plug on these traitors. B-Bye, ikes. (laughs) BLUE: Sending now. What happened? Do you all see it get darker, too? Oh, good, for a second I thought I was having a... Whoa, mood lighting, though. You devil dog, look at you. Brand X must have killed the power. But, but the e-mail went through, right? Maybe, but now we can't count on headquarters coming to save us. But you said we ain't gonna survive the night unless headquarters gets rid of Brand X. I don't understand... I don't get it. So, what do we do now? Fight. Come on, let's get up to that vent and over to the CopaBanana. The oven timer is ticking. There are only two kinds of product icons. Desirable like me... ...and undesirable. We must send all the undesirables where they belong-- the Expiration Station. (crowd gasps) Better hope Polar brings a banana boatload of ikes to the Copa tonight. Look around. Do you see an ike with an inferior product? Turn in the undesirables. Join Brand X for a better way of life. Ah. (belching) (echoes) (cricket chirps) Kiwi Koala did it. No, no, I didn't do any... Jeepers! There must be some mistake. Hey, hey, wait, where are you taking me? From this day forward you must prove you are desirable. Soon we will become the model of excellence until the entire world is just like us. One store, one X! CROWD: One store, one X! One world, one X! One world, one X! ALL: One store, one X!

We've all lost someone-- a friend, a neighbor, someone we love. But we can't fight for the way things were, only for the way things should be. Together we can stop this tyrant.

But, you might wanna keep it under, like, 40 at a time. But whose are we gonna find to slithers in filthy slime through the sewers, go into enemy territory and cut the power lines to starts the lightning storm? Ah, slither and slime? It would appear you're in need of a professional. How do we know you're not with Brand X? According to the lady, I'm the poster boy for undesirable icons. You know, boss, if you don't mind the suggestion, we could fights fire with fire here. Welcome to the war, Weasel. 'Tis a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before.

Careful, Harry, if you value what little hair you have left. What's the point... of luxurious locks... if you can't look yourself in the mirror? Dear! Oh, my goodness! - Let him go! He'll be exterminated like the rest of them! Polar! I thought I told you to go to the Banana! - See, Dex, I can help. No! Another pathetic ike bites the dust. No one puts Polar in the freezer. I'm marking you down, shrimp toast. It wasn't my fault! I was just following orders. I don't even like her. Lady X promised she would make me tall and thin. DEX: Then you finally got your wish. I'm gonna pop your corn, lady. Roll over, Dogtective. You're mine. (groans) Long live la resistance! La... Adios, my brave cheese puff ike. (whimpers) (sighs) Hang in there, Polar. If you're ever in that big freezer in the sky, you got a friend, Dex. Oh. Use the whole box. Polar would have liked it that way. DOCTOR: Dex, Dex! I ran tests on the poison liquid the X-o-bytes are stinging our ike... (whimpers) ...ikes with-- - Doc, Doc, Doc, so, what is it? It's a deservative. Okay, imagine the chemical opposite of a preservative, huh, yeah? One dose causes the victim to spoil in his own unique way. A cookie crumbles; ice cream gets freezer burn. Oh, chips chip, crackers crack, aluminum is foiled! Don't you see? Snot happens! This is a big booger we're bouncing into even! I get the picture. We need an antidote, fast! (cries) Ham it, Dex! I'm a nose doctor, not a miracle worker! - Go! What is with this guy? He's always asking me to do the impossible things. I can't do the impossible things! If I could do them, they wouldn't be possibly impossible! (panting) Ow! (glass breaking) I'm fine! Nobody saw that! Ah! All the lightning rods are in place, I guarantee it. Well, pretty guaranteed. I mean, it's almost guaranteed. I can't guarantee it. Well, because... my eyes aren't that good! I don't see that well! But my heart's in the right place, if I had one. Now, phase two is up to Cheasel the Weasel. That idiot? I mean, fantastic. I'll go check again. Easy, Dan, easy. (explosions) Man, phase two ain't gonna work. Not with all those X-o-bytes swarming. There's... There's just too many of 'em. They're refueling their poison inside the Brand X building. Can you fly me over Lady X's aisle? Oh, yeah, sure. No prob. Except I don't have a death wish! If I can cut off their poison supply, maybe we can turn this thing around! (explosion) Dex, suppose you make it in? There's no way you'll get out. It's suicide! (explosion) Like Sunshine always used to say, "When in doubt, just do the right thing and you can't go wrong." Yeah, man, but I don't want to lose you, too. Hey, pal, you're the one who convinced me to get back in the game. You never stopped believing in me, even when I stopped believing in myself. That's 'cause you're the best. But if you go in there, you ain't coming out. Don't do it, Dex! You should be here with us. I should have been with you the whole time. But after Sunshine, I just gave up. I let you all down. (explosion) I know now that my problems are just a hill of coffee beans compared to our store, our world, our family. If I don't make it back, I'm counting on you to take my place, pal. Me? No, I can't. You can do it, Dan. I believe in you. This place won't be the same without you. I won't be. The secret's inside, old buddy. You'll be just fine. So, am I flying, or am I walking? - All right. Let's win this sucker! (clanking) Oh! (thudding and clinking) (cat yowling) (clanking) (whirring) (wind whipping) (sniffing) (saw buzzing) (tires screeching) (wood creaking) (creaking continues) Agony. She's like my loyal beloved. You got loyal beloved! I want you... loyal beloved! (growling) (grunts) Allow me to introduce you. (grunts) (creaking and thudding) (electrical hissing) (thunderous explosions) Note to self: Cheasel T. Weasel rocks. (engine whining, explosions) DAN: Okay, okay. Hey, Dex, don't worry, bro. I'm gonna get you closer. Once more into the bleach, my friend. Once more. (whimpers) Uh, Dex? Dex! (explosions) Dare the day, Dex. Dare the day. (engine revving) (metallic clank, low rolling thunder) Uh, Dex's plan is working! Duh, but I still do not know how. MOOSE: Like a meatball, this guy! Cheasel's starting an electrical lightning storm. We put lightning rods on all our buildings to keep 'em safe. Brand X don't have lightning rods, so they gets destroyed. A true spark of genius. The boss is a regular Benjamin Franklin! Yeah. Uh, duh, who's Benjamin Franklin? Benjamin Franklin with the key and the kite, the lightning, the... Uh, what aisle is he in? Ah, forget about it. (distant explosions) (whirring, liquid gurgling) (metallic clinking, wind whipping) (wind whipping) (clang, explosions, glass breaking) I'm coming for you, Lady. (crackling, thudding) (thunder rumbling) Sunshine! Dex! Hold it right there, or Blondie gets it. SUNSHINE: Watch out! On your knees, Dog. (hissing, thunder rumbling) I always knew you were damaged goods. I'm not the one who's gonna be poppy-whipped, you cold-farted itch. Exterminate them both. Her first. Make him watch his Sunshine fade away. With great pleasure. (loud thunderclap, glass breaking) Okay, then, I'll just leave you to it. (thunderclap) Ow! (groaning) I thought that only worked in movies. (wind whipping) Raisins, Dex! (wind whipping, ricocheting) (whistling) (grunts) Well, this isn't very much fun, is it? (groans) I think I've just wet myself. (gasps) It feels rather nice. Oh! (thud) (hissing, thunder rumbling, explosion) Oh, Dex. I knew you'd find me. I'm sorry. I thought you were... I'm here. We're together. My world is whole again, kitten. I never stopped believing in you, Dex. And I always kept you close to my heart. My big, tough guy. What have they done to you? Brand X took my essence. Of course! The perfumed smell. That's why it was familiar. The secret ingredient in their elixir. The evil X turned your sweetness, your goodness into something vile. (loud rumbling thunder, wooden creaking) The whole thing could go any minute. As long as I'm with you, nothing else matters. (plane engine buzzing) (hissing, explosion) Only one way he can make it in time! - Not the-- Yes, kitten, the loop-de-loop. He's never pulled it off. Come on, Dan. You the man. (engine revving) You got to be... for them! You can do it, pal! Just believe it! Believe in yourself! Come on! That's it, Dan! The loop-de-loop! He'll get it this time; I know he will. Oh, dare the day! Whoo! ALL: Dare the day and fly away. Yes, the sun is shining again, baby! Whoo! Look at you. Bring me anything? Give me a hug. It's so good to see you. SUNSHINE: I just knew you'd do it, Danny. DEX: Me too, pal, me too. SUNSHINE: Dex, something's wrong. What's happening? I understand that somebody ordered a recall. Dan, go find Lady X. I've got a bone to pick with this guy. No, Dex, you can't. Not a human. You'll be crushed. I'll be fine. I have to be, to make sure nothing bad ever happens to you. Maximillius, Lola, let's bring him down. You got it, boss. Mi comprendo big time, jefe. Hey, whack job. It's checkout time. You pompous pip-squeak. I'll stomp you into oblivion. I was hoping you'd say that. I'll crush your little friends into icon stew. (mechanical hissing) A robot? Extraordinary, aren't I? How the Ho-Ho's can this be happening? Don't you recognize me, Dogtective? Sunshine's old neighbor? Priscilla? From Priscilla Pusley's Genetically Giant Prunes? But you were recalled. And butt-ugly. Quick trip to Brazil for a little plastic surgery, and I'm back for my revenge. So, you built yourself a human robot and recalled Sunshine. Then you stole her essence to make your elixir for Brand X? Why? All anyone ever wanted was that sweet Sunshine Goodness. Two months I sat on the shelf next to little Miss Perfect. No one bought my beautifully, genetically giant prunes. But how did you get in and out of the store? You're an ike. Humans. When you look like this, you can get them to do anything. Size only counts for men. (stammering) Clever plan, Pus, but Brand X is being recalled. You'll never get me. I still have my elixir; I'll be back. But enough about me. Let's kill you. DAREDEVIL DAN: Yo, dog, put your guard up. Sugar smack upside her prune head! Put your arms-- - MAXIMILLIUS: Forget about it. Boss'll never, ever hit a dame. Tell me something. Uh, are those melons real? MAXIMILLIUS: He should Pudding Pop her one. That ain't his MO. Forget about it. He won't hit her. Not now, not never. But I will. The bimbo's mine. Get ready, Lady, 'cause I'm gonna kick you where the sun don't shine. Bring it on; let's go. You're not so tough now. DAREDEVIL DAN: Oh, look at you! Sunshine chip-slapped her back to ugly. SUNSHINE: Gross. It doesn't have to end like this. All I ever really wanted was you. Well, you, and world domination. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a Spam. Oh, the indignity of it all! Dan, wrap her up and take her to the Expiration Station for recall with the rest of Brand X. I heard there was a resistance. (giggles) Call me fashionably late. You may be mostly fluff, Harry, but the rest of you is pretty strong stuff. - Oh, I'm off for a quick calm down and shot of toodly-pip. Nice work, everybody. Dex, Dex, Dex, I found an antidote to the deservative. It should bring all the ikes back to life. Oh, joy! Let's give it a whiff, huh? I knew you'd save me, friend. Oh, my. But it's still chilly. Oh, Dex, I'm so proud of you. You saved us all. We saved each other because the secret is inside. Inside all of us! All right, see? Things really turned out perfect. The good old days are back. With one change, I hope. Sunshine... ...will you marry me? Oh, yes, Dex. (cheering) Dex is Jewish? Yeah, kosher.
