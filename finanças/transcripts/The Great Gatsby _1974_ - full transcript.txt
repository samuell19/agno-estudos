"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone," he told me, "just remember "that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all my judgments. It was a matter of chance that I should have decided to spend the summer on that slender, riotous island which juts out into the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound, 20 miles due east of New York. I lived at West Egg on the... well, less fashionable side of the courtesy bay. And my cousin, Daisy Buchanan, lived in one of the glittering white palaces of East Egg with her husband, Tom, whom I'd known in college. They had spent the years since their marriage drifting here and there unrestfully, wherever people played polo and were rich together. Nick Carraway! Nick, it's about time. I'm really not sure how to operate that thing. Well, you should have told us. We would have sent the motor cruiser for you. How are you? Is this all yours? Some of it belongs to Daisy. Where's your place? Across the bay. But it's just a little cottage I got for 80 a month. 80 a month?! Our beer bills at New Haven were more than that. You forget... I am now just a struggling bond salesman on Wall Street. Nick? Is it really you? It is. Oh... Oh, my dear, lost love! I'm paralyzed with happiness. Jordan, this is my second cousin once removed, Nick Carraway. Does that mean we kiss when we greet, or no? I hope it means we do. Tom says you've just come from Chicago. Tell me everything. Do they miss me? The whole town is desolate. Oh, how gorgeous. All the cars have their left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there's a persistent wail all night. Let's go back tomorrow, Tom. I love a persistent wail. Well, I love a drink. Come on, let's all have a drink. I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember. You live across the Sound in West Egg. I know somebody there. I don't know a single person. You must know Gatsby. Oh, he's my neighbor. Gatsby?! What Gatsby? Come on, Daisy. Why candles? In two weeks, it'll be the longest day in the year. Do you always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it? I do. We ought to plan something. All right. What'll we plan? What do people plan? Look at that. My little finger, it's all black and blue. You did that, Tom. I know you didn't mean to, but that's what I get for marrying a brute of a man. A great big hulking brute of a man. Oh, Daisy, I hate that word, "hulking." Even in kidding. Hulking. Please, let's not start one of those. Nick? Have you read that, uh, book, The Rise of the Colored Empires, by Goddard? Why no. Well, it's a fine book, and everyone ought to read it. See, the point is that if we don't watch out, the white race will be utterly submerged. No, that's so. It's up to us... who are the dominant race... to watch out, or these other races will have control of things. We've got to beat them down. Now, Daisy, it has all been scientifically proved. You see, we're Nordics. You are, and I am, and... Excuse me, sir. Thank you. Will you excuse me? Anyway, we're responsible for all the things that have gone to make civilization... art, science... and all that. I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a... a rose. An absolute rose. Doesn't he? You're Jordan Baker, the golf champion, aren't you? Shh! Don't talk. I want to hear what happens. Is something happening? You mean you don't know? I thought everyone knew. I don't. Tom's got a woman in New York. She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinnertime, don't you think? Couldn't be helped. Oh, there's a bird on the lawn. I think it must be a nightingale, come over on the Cunard or the White Star Line. He's singing away. It's romantic, isn't it, Tom? Yes, it is romantic. It had been a golden afternoon, and I remember having the familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. By the autumn, my mood would be very different. Good night! Good night. Come back soon. I would want no more privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only my neighbor, Gatsby, would be exempt from my reaction... Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn... for Gatsby turned out all right in the end. It was what preyed on him, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams. At least once a fortnight, a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby's enormous gardens. There was music from my neighbor's house through those summer nights. In his enchanted gardens, men and girls came and went like moths, among the whispering and the champagne and the stars. I believe that few people were actually invited to these parties. They just went. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow, they ended up at Gatsby's door. Come for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission. And after that, they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with an amusement park. About halfway between the two Eggs and New York, the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a short distance... presided over by the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, set there by some wild wag of an oculist to fatten his practice in the Borough of Queens. This desolate area is a valley of ashes, a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat. Come on in. I want you to meet my girl. Wilson! Wilson! Wilson, old man. How's business? Can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car? Next week. I've got my man working on it now. Works a little slow, don't he? No, as a matter of fact, he doesn't. If you're not interested in buying it, I'm sure... that I can find someone who is. I didn't mean that. L-I just meant that... Well, I figure I could fix it up and turn a profit. Myrtle Wilson, this is Nick Carraway. Nick, Mr. And Mrs. Wilson. Why don't you get some chairs, so someone can sit down? Oh, sure. I want you to get on the next train. All right. I'll meet you in the city. I really could use that car. Think I got a buyer for it. That's fine. Fine. I'll make sure that my man stays right on it. Nick? Mrs. Wilson, nice to see you. Bye. Tom! Hello, Nick. Stop, stop here. I want to get one of these dogs. I want one for the apartment. They're so nice to have, a dog. What kind are they? All kinds. What kind would you like, lady? I'd like one of those police dogs. That's not a police dog. That dog's not exactly a police dog. That dog's more of an Airedale. Hey, look at that coat. Some coat! That dog will never bother you with catching a cold. I think it's cute. How much is it? Uh, that dog? Uh, that dog will cost you ten dollars. Is it a boy or a girl? That dog? That dog's a boy. That dog's a bitch! Here's ten dollars. Go buy ten more dogs with it. I'll leave you here. Oh, no, you don't. Myrtle would be very hurt if you wouldn't come upstairs to the apartment, wouldn't you, Myrtle? Come on. I'll call my sister, Catherine. Uh... People who know her say she's beautiful. What about our appointments? Now, Wall Street'll still be there tomorrow. Come along. I really like that dress. I think it's adorable. Oh, it's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on sometimes when I don't care what I look like. It looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean. You know, l-I think if-if Chester could get you in that pose... I think he could really make something out of it. I'm Catherine, Myrtle's sister. Oh. People say we look like twins, but I don't think so. I'm Nick. Won't you sit down? I told that boy about the ice. These servants, you really have to keep after them all the time. You live down on Long Island, too? Yes, I live in West Egg. Really?! Mm-hmm. I was just down at a party in West Egg, about a month ago, at a man named Gatsby's. Do you know him? I live next door to him. He's German. Really. A cousin or a nephew or something of Kaiser Wilhelm. That's where all his money comes from. Really? Oh, I'm scared of him. Why? Oh, I'd hate to have him get anything on me. Oh. Look at that cute dog! Oh, darling! Excuse me, Myrtle, could you come here for a minute? Neither of them can stand the person they're married to. Can't they? Can't stand them! What I say is, why go on living with them if they can't stand them? Huh. Ooh! Isn't that adorable, this little thing? Myrtle's been living over that garage for 11 years, you know. And Tom's the first sweetie she ever had. I was on a train to New York, to see Catherine and spend the night. Tom was sitting opposite me. He had on a... dress suit and patent-leather shoes. And I could see he was a real gentleman. I couldn't keep my eyes off him. Every time he looked at me, I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we pulled into the station, he was next to me, and his white shirtfront was pressed against my arm. I said, "Well, I'll have to call a policeman," but he knew I was lying. I was so excited. When I got into the taxi, my head was swimming. I felt as if some very tiny, cold, little fish was swimming in my veins. All I kept thinking was... I kept thinking, "You can't live forever. You can't live forever." It was the best day of my life. Myrtle... Oh, what did you do to him?! Oh, big clumsy. What did you do? Don't ever call me clumsy. Myrtle, don't slam the door in my face. Get out! Please. But you see, it's... it's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic, and they don't believe in divorce. ...her name again. I do to have a right to say her name anytime I damn well please! - Daisy! - Shut up. - Daisy! Daisy! - Shut up! I can say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Daisy! Dai... Daisy. Daisy... Care for some chocolate cake, madam? Thank you very much. Sorry we're late. Okay. Hurry up. - Come on, get dressed. - Be right back. Wonderful. Aw, she tries... I'm going to arrange a marriage between you and Jordan. I'll sort of fling you together... you know, lock you up accidentally in the linen closet, or push you out to sea in a boat. All that sort of thing. Daisy, I have no money. Would Jordan marry a man with no money? Of course not. Oh. Well, it'll just have to be an affair then. We don't know each other very well, do we, Nick? Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding. I wasn't back from the war. Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Hello, sweetheart. Let me tell you what I said when she was born. She was less than an hour old and Tom was... God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and I asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl. And so I turned away my head and wept. "All right," I said, "I'm glad it's a girl, and I hope she'll be a little fool." That's the best thing a girl can be in this world... a beautiful, little fool. Here you are. Having a little heart-to-heart with Nick? But, yes. I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. L-It sort of... crept up on us, and first thing we knew... Don't believe everything you hear, Nick. My, my, my. She is the most immoral young lady I have ever seen. Mr. Carraway. Yes? Mr. Gatsby would be honored if you would attend his little party tonight. ♪ Five foot two, eyes of blue ♪ ♪ But, oh, what those five foot could do ♪ ♪ Has anybody seen my girl? ♪ Oh, Thank you. ♪ Turned up nose, turned down hose ♪ ♪ Never had no other beaus ♪ ♪ Has anybody seen my girl? ♪ ♪ Now if you run into ♪ ♪ A five foot two, covered with fur ♪ ♪ Diamond rings, and all those things ♪ ♪ Betcha life it isn't her ♪ ♪ But could she love, could she woo... ♪ Hello, Jordan.

I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last, I tore my gown on a chair and he asked my name. Who's he? Gatsby, of course. Inside of a week, I get a package from Croirier's with a new evening gown in it. Did you keep it? Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas-blue with lavender beads. $265! There's something funny about a fella who'll do a thing like that. He doesn't want any trouble with anybody. Who? Gatsby. Uh, somebody told me... Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once. Killed a man? I heard that he was connected with the government during the war, in a high way. A spy, I heard. I heard he was in oil, from a man who knew all about him... grew up with him in Texas. I knew somebody who grew up with him in St. Paul. Well, you look at him sometime when he doesn't know anyone's looking at him. You can see it in his eyes. I'll bet he did kill a man. Which one is he? Never really goes to his own parties. Just looks in to see who's here, then disappears. God knows where he is. Pheasant? You know I always want pheasant. Oh, yes, of course, madam. Evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your entertainer for the evening. I just got married. Married the fattest girl you ever saw. Boy, she was so fat, when she sat on a drugstore stool, she had a hangover. She hated to wear dresses... always skirts. When she walked down... Thank God, it's a fight. Let's get out. This is much too polite for me. Excuse me, sir. Would you mind following me, please? I don't understand. Just follow me, please. Excuse me. I wa... I was invited. Mr. Gatsby sent a man over this afternoon with an invitation. I live right across over there. Right across the lawn. Are you sure you've got the right person? Yeah. Excuse me. How do you do, old sport? I'm Gatsby. Nick Carraway. It's a pleasure. You live in the cottage across the lawn. I tried to buy it once. I've been trying to find you, but... I'm afraid I'm not a very good host. Truth of the matter is... I don't much like parties. I thought we should get acquainted since we're neighbors. I hope you're enjoying yourself. Yes. Thank you. If there's anything you want or need... No, no, no, no. Everything's fine, thank you. - It's very nice. - Good, good. It's a lovely night for the party. Yeah. Was there anything else? No, no. I just thought perhaps... we should meet. Yes. Excuse me. Shall I, uh...? No, no, no. Yes? What? I don't give a damn what Philadelphia wants. I said a small town. If that's his idea of a small town, he's no use to us. No. No. I'm sorry, old sport. It was business. Yes, well, I've taken up too much of your time as it is. Are there any of my guests that you'd especially like to meet? No, no, thank you. Perhaps we can have lunch sometime... tomorrow? Fine. Good, good. See you then. ♪ La-la-ley-la! ♪ ♪ La-la-la-la... ♪ ♪ La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la... ♪ Grand, isn't it? What do you think, old sport? It's beautiful, isn't it? Yes. Like to drive it? No, I don't think I'd want the responsibility. Get in. Look here, what's your opinion of me, anyhow? I hadn't really thought about it. I'm going to tell you something about my life. Really? I... I don't want you to get the wrong impression from the stories you hear. Why me? I'm the son of wealthy people from the Midwest... all dead now. What part of the Midwest? I was raised in America, but educated at Oxford. That's a family tradition. My family died and I came into a great deal of money. After that, I traveled and lived in many capitals in Europe, trying to forget something sad that happened long ago. And then came the war. I was promoted to major after I distinguished myself in a battle in the Argonne Forest. Every Allied government gave me a decoration. Even Montenegro. Little Montenegro down in the Adriatic Sea. Turn it. "Major Jay Gatsby, For Valor Extraordinary." Why are you telling me this? You don't make much money, do you? You sell bonds? I try to. Well, if you'll forgive me... You see, I run a small business on the side and I thought perhaps you might want to pick up an extra bit of money. What kind of business exactly? I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. This is a nice restaurant, but I like across the street better. It's too hot over there. Hot and small, yes, but full of memories. What place is that? The old Metropole, filled with faces now dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget as long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. There was six of us at the table. Rosy had eaten and drunk a lot the whole evening. A waiter came over to him with a funny look, says, "Somebody wants to talk to you outside." "All right," says Rosy. He starts to get up. I pull him down in his seat. "Let the bastards come in here if they want you, but don't you, so help me, make a move out of this room." Then it was 4:00 in the morning. If we'd raised the blinds, we could have seen daylight. Did he go? Sure, he went. He turned in the doorway, he says, "Don't let the waiter take away my coffee." They were on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in the belly and they drove away. I understand you're looking for a business connection, huh? We'll talk about that later. Huh? This is a friend, so we'll talk about that some other time. Oh, I beg your pardon. I had it wrong, man. Gatsby? Excuse me, please. He has a telephone. Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman. Yes. He went to Oxford College in England. You know Oxford College? Uh, have you, have you known Gatsby for a long time? Known him? I made him. I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. He was so hard up, he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn't buy regular clothes. But I said to myself, that's the kind of man you'd like to bring home, introduce to your mother and your sister. I see you're looking at my cuff buttons. Finest specimen of human molars. Well, that's a very interesting idea. Yes. Did you, uh, were you and Mr. Rosenthal close friends? Thick like that in everything. I'm sorry. What's to be sorry? Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he's alive, not after he's dead. After that, my own rule is to let everything alone. Everything's taken care of. Ah. I enjoyed my lunch. Don't hurry, Meyer. No, you're very polite, but I belong to another generation. You sit here and discuss your sports, and your young ladies, and your... As for me, I'm 60 years old, and I won't impose myself on you any longer. He becomes very sentimental sometimes. What is he, anyway? A dentist? Meyer Wolfsheim? No, no. He's a gambler, old sport. He's the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. I never thought one man fixed the World Series. I always imagined it just happened. He just saw the opportunity. Why isn't he in jail? Oh, they can't get him, old sport. He's too smart. Look, uh, l... oh... Let me get this, please. Nonsense. Nick. Where have you been? Daisy's furious because you haven't called up. This is Mr. Gatsby... Mr. Buchanan. How are you? How does a struggling bond salesman afford to eat with these big business types? I just came down here to have lunch with Mr. Gatsby. Oh. So this is where you hide yourself. Jordan. Listen, I've got to talk to you. I have the most astonishing thing to tell you. He wants to know if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and let him come over. Who? Gatsby. If that's what he wanted, why didn't he ask me himself? I think he was afraid. He's waited so long, he thought you might be offended. But why me? Because. Why didn't he ask you to arrange the meeting? Because he wants her to see his house and you live right next door. That's ridiculous. I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties some night, but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. He says he's read the papers for years, just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name. I wonder why. Daisy ought to have something in her life. Does Daisy want to see him? She's not to know about it. You're just supposed to invite her to tea. But does she want to see Gatsby? You're cousin will thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Nick. Your place looks like the World's Fair. Does it? Yes, I was just looking into some of my rooms. Oh, I... I spoke to Miss Baker. Yes? I'm going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over for tea. What day would suit you? What day would suit you? I don't want to put you to any trouble, you see. Wouldn't you like to come in out of the rain? No, it's not necessary. I have to go back. Uh, what-what do you...? Wh-What about the day after tomorrow? Well... I have to get the grass cut. You mean my grass. Well... They-they are connected, uh... There's that other thing. The... What thing? Our, uh, our business relationship. Any favors that I do for you don't need any payment. Well, thank you. Good night, Nick. Nick, my darling, where are you calling from? China? I can barely hear you. What... Of course, I'll come. But don't bring Tom? Tom who? Yes. Good-bye, my darling. Thank you. Mr. Carraway? Yes? Mr. Gatsby sent me over to cut the grass. Oh, yes, quite all right. Go ahead. From Mr. Gatsby. I know. From Mr. Gatsby. Pass. Everything all right? The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean. What grass? Oh, it looks good. Uh, I was wondering if you have everything you need in the way of... tea. Will this do? Yes, yes, of course. But I took the liberty of, uh... uh... I took the liberty of... I took the liberty of having some things sent over. I'm going home. What for? There's nobody coming. It's too late. Don't be silly. It's only five minutes to 4:00. This is a mistake. This is a terrible mistake. Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? I adore it. Are you in love with me? Yes. Is that why I had to come alone? That is the secret of Castle Rackrent. Oh, it's delicious, Nick. - And what beautiful... - Well, that's funny. Flowers. Oh... White. My favorite color. Daisy, I'd like you to meet my neighbor, Mr. Jay Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby, this is my cousin, Daisy Buchanan. We've met... before. We haven't met for many years. Eight years... next November. Well... shall we have some tea? It stopped raining. Has it? Wha... what do you think of that? It stopped raining. I'm glad, Jay. Would you like tea? Oh, Nick, darling, I feel today's like someone's birthday. Let's have champagne. I want you and Daisy to come to my house. I'd like to show her around. You sure you want me to come? Absolutely. Nick, uh, l-I'd just like to wash up. Oh. Oh. Look... my house shows up well, doesn't it? It's splendid. Yeah. It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it. I thought you said you inherited your money. I, uh, I did, old sport. But I lost most of it in the big panic... in the, uh, panic of the war. What business are you really in? That's my affair. - Uh... - I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been in several things, actually. I was in the drug store business. Then I was in oil. But I'm not in either one now. That huge place over there? Do you like it? I love it. But how do you live there all by yourself? Oh, I keep it always full of interesting people. Night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people. It's beautiful. Beautiful. Excuse us. It's quite all right. Klipspringer here is left over from a party I threw in April. He was here for two weeks before I discovered he'd moved in. Did we interrupt your exercises? I was asleep. That is, I had been asleep and then I got up. Oh. Klipspringer here plays the piano, don't you, old sport? Oh, I hardly play at all. Nonsense. Of course you do. We'll go upstairs now and he'll play the piano for us. Yes? Oh, of course, of course I'll play for you. Uh, I really am out of practice. No, don't talk so much, old sport.

All those officers, what were their names? Do you remember their names? Parts of their names. Not their faces. Silly young men... so silly... to let an 18-year-old girl into their hearts. Sentimental. You were never sentimental, Jay. I can't believe it's all here... everything that's happened to me. I collected them. Your debut after the Armistice, pictures of you in shining cars... every ball you attended. I wore out a hundred pairs of slippers. Come and sit by me, Jay. I will. Why do you stand or sit as far away from me as possible? I find it... difficult. To be close to me? It's been a very long time since I've been able to look at you. Oh... I wish you had your uniform still. I would wear the same gown I wore when you were my favorite beau, Jay. We would dance right here in the great hall of this preposterous house of yours, Jay Gatsby. My sweet young Lieutenant Jay Gatsby. I do still have my uniform. Then you are a sentimental man. And Tom? Did you love him? Tom who? Tom, your husband. I know who you're referring to. Why did you marry Tom, Daisy? I don't want to talk about Tom. Or my wedding. It makes me sad, and I want to be happy. You used to like to make me happy. You didn't love him. It was fine for you, wasn't it? Crowding into my life. Riding in my white car. Wearing your romantic uniform that hid who you were or where you came from. Breaking my heart with your impossible love. And then going off to your great adventure overseas, leaving... I told you I'd come back for you, in my letter. You said you'd wait. I'd waited so long. We were so close in our month of love. Why did you marry him? Mr. Tom Buchanan, son of Mr. Tom Buchanan of Chicago, Illinois, blew into my life with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private railroad cars. He hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel. He... he just blinded me with excitement. He gave you a string of pearl valued at $350,000. Jordan Baker told you that, didn't she? Traitor. Well, what else did she tell you? Did she tell you how she found me that night, lying there in my hotel room, drunk as a monkey, with a bottle of sauterne in one hand? And... and... My letter in the other. "I never had a drink before," I said, "but, oh, how I do enjoy it." And I... I pulled the $350,000 string of pearls out of the wastepaper basket where I had dropped them and said, "Here, dearest. "You take these downstairs and give them back "to whoever from Chicago they belong to, "and tell him... tell them all... that Daisy's changed her mind. Daisy's changed her mind." The next day, at 5:00, you married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver. You know what Jordan did? She ran a cold tub and dropped me into it, dress and all. And I couldn't stop crying. But I wouldn't let go of the letter... your letter. I hung on to it and hung on to it until it came to pieces in the water. Melted away like snow. Why? Why didn't you wait for me? Because... rich girls don't marry poor boys, Jay Gatsby. Haven't you heard? Rich girls don't marry poor boys. Well, I see the Chester Beckers are here... and the Leeches. Uh-oh, there's that man Bensen... I knew him at Yale. How are you? Good evening. How are you? Despised him. The Hornbeams, Willie Voltaire. How are you? Tom, how are you? Nice to see you. Thank you. Thank you. Good God, look. A whole clan of Blackbucks already gathered in the corner. Flipping their noses up. Practically all of East Egg here. - Hello. - Ismays, how are you? Oh, Mr. Christie, sir, how are you? Nice to see you. You know my wife, Daisy. - Jordan Baker. - Hello. Mr. And Mrs. Christie. Hammerheads, too. Oh, look, Beluga, the tobacco importer. And Beluga's girls. This is mixed company. West Eggers. I recognize some of them. Mrs. Pole... and Mr. And Mrs. Mulready right behind them. Oh, look, darling, over there. Cecil Roebuck. Cecil Schoel right there. This is Gulick in the blue suit, the state senator. And that's G. Earl Muldoon, brother of the Muldoon who strangled his wife. There's James B. "Rot-gut" Ferrett. Oh, look here, young Nick Carraway. Been seeing an awful lot of this Gatsby fellow lately. Nick. How are you, Nick? Fine. Nice to see you. Daisy, you look lovely. You, too, Jordan. Thank you. What about me? Tom, I'm leaving you for Nick. We're running away to Africa. Very nice. These things excite me so. If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name or present a green card, I'm giving out green car... Jay Gatsby. I'm so happy to see you. I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. Absolutely right. I remember it very well. About three weeks ago. Absolutely right. I just told you that. You were with Nick here. You must see many faces of people you've heard about or know here tonight. Yes. Actually, we don't know a soul here. Senator Evans. Mrs. Buchanan... How do you do? ...and Mr. Buchanan, the polo player. How do you do? Colonel. I've never seen so many celebrities. Oh, I like that man with the sort of blue nose. Oh, he's a rather small producer. Oh. Well, I like him anyhow. I'd a little rather not be the polo player. He'd rather look at all these famous people incognito. They're in some new Broadway show. Go ahead. And if you want to write down any addresses, here's my little gold pencil. Daisy... It's all right. You have my permission. Jordan will chaperone. You'll keep watch, won't you? In case there's a fire, a flood or an act of God. Kiss me. Hiya, Buchanan. Sharks in my hair! There are sharks in my hair! Have you seen Daisy? No, I haven't. But Jordan told me that she was with you. She was with Gatsby and some people. Tell me something, Nick. Who's this Gatsby fellow anyhow? Some big bootlegger? I heard he was a relative of the kaiser. Nick... I figure he's just a bootlegger. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers. Did you know that? Not Gatsby. Oh, now... he certainly must've strained himself to get this menagerie together. Coat. At least they're more interesting than the people we know. Where have you been? Up dancing. Love belongs to me... I don't have to ask who with, do I, Daisy? Well, it wasn't Beluga the tobacco importer. - Give it to me. - Dee, da-da Where is he now, Daisy? Without a shirt, without a shirt Who, Beluga? No, not Beluga, Gatsby. He was called to the phone. - Oh, really? - From Detroit. Oh, I'd like to know who he is and what he does. And I want you to get in this car right now. "Right now." Right now, Daisy. Actually, I can tell you what he does. He owns some drugstores, a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself. Get in the car please. Without a shirt, without a shirt Daisy, get in the car right now. - Good night to you, Nick. - Get in the car! Without a shirt, without a shirt, good night. See you, Nick. Good night. Get in the car. Without a shirt, without a shirt. Thank you for staying, Nick. She didn't like it. Of course she did. She didn't have a good time. I'll fix everything. Just the way it was before. She'll see. You can't repeat the past. Can't repeat the past? Of course you can. Find out where his money comes from... what clubs he belongs to... who his parents are and where they live. And his women. I want to know about his women. Put on your uniform. That's foolish. Oh, good. Let's be foolish. Put on your uniform and we'll turn out all the lights except for a single candle, and I'll let you tell me you love me. Do you remember that night? Mm... that still October night. I felt married to you ever since. I knew that if I could kiss you... If I could kiss you... I love you, Jay. Did you know that I bought this house just to be across the bay from you? Don't say that. I'll start to cry again. Oh, Jay. It's the color of the light on your dock. But... you know I can't wear it. You wear it for me. I'll love you forever. Kiss me. Be my lover. Stay my lover. I'll be your husband. Husband and lover. Oh, hi. I'm from the New York Journal. Wanted to ask you some questions about your neighbor... Mr. Gatsby. What sort of questions? Oh, you know, I was just wondering if you've seen anything interesting going on. No. I've been hearing his name around the office quite a lot the last couple of weeks. Seems he and Meyer Wolfsheim... You know that name? ...got something big cooking. I don't know what you're talking about. This is unofficial really. This is really my day off. I like to come out here sometimes on my day off. If you want to know something, why don't you try asking Mr. Gatsby? It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night. Are you closing your place down? No. I hear you fired all your servants. Daisy comes over quite often in the afternoon. I don't want gossip. You seem to attract it. They say you killed a man. Just one? ♪ When you and I were 17 ♪ ♪ And life and love were new ♪ ♪ The world was just a field of dreams... ♪ And you? Have you ever loved anybody else? No. Of course, you could never love anybody but me. I love the way you love me. Do you recall when love was all and we were 17? I don't want you to go home to him anymore. I want to tell him. We'll tell him. I promise. We'll tell him. Soon. I read somewhere that it's... the Sun's getting hotter every year. Seems that the Earth is going to fall into the Sun. Actually, it's just the opposite of that. The Sun is getting colder every year. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Davis Goff is on the telephone. Ah, yes. Excuse me. You know I love you. You forget there's a lady present. Huh? Oh... you kiss Nick, too. What a low, vulgar girl. I don't care. Mommy! Mommy! Ah, blessed precious! Come to your own mother that loves you. Now, say how do you do. How do you do. Say how do you do. How do you do. Aren't you... dream. You absolute little dream. Yes. Aunt Jordan's got a blue dress, too. How do you like Mother's friends, hmm? Do you think they're pretty? Where's Daddy? She doesn't look like her father. She looks like me. She's got my hair, and the shape of the face. Come, Pammy. Good-bye, sweetheart. Good-bye, Mommy. Daddy! Daddy! Oh, how's Daddy's little girl? Daddy, I met all Mommy's friends. Aw, that's my good girl. Now you run along and I'll see you later. Yes. Well... what do we do with ourselves this afternoon? And the day after that? And the next 30 years? Don't be morbid. Life starts all over again when things get crisp in the fall. But it's so hot! And everything's so confused. Let-let's all go to town. - Huh? - That's an idea. Ah. You look so cool. You always look so cool. I mean... you resemble the advertisement of the man in the... All right. I'm perfectly willing to go to town. Why don't we all go to town? Come on. If we're going, let's start. Let's have some fun! It's too hot to fuss. I don't get the idea of going to town. Women... get these notions in their heads. Shall we take anything to drink? I'll get some whiskey. I can't say anything inside his house, old sport. She's got an indiscreet voice. It's full of... It's full of... Her voice is full of money. Jay Gatsby. Shall we take my car? Is it a standard shift? Yes. Then why don't you let me take your car, you take mine. There's not much gas, I'm afraid. Oh, there's plenty of gas, and if we run out, we can always stop at a drugstore. You can buy almost anything at a drugstore nowadays. You ought to know that. Daisy, you come on ride with me here in the circus wagon. No. Um, you take Nick and Jordan. Uh, we'll follow. Come on. Did you see that? Did I see what? I've made a small investigation of this fellow, you know. And found he was an Oxford man. Oxford like hell. He wears a goddamn pink suit. Nevertheless, he is an Oxford man. Oxford, New Mexico. Or something like that. Well, let's have some gas. I'm sick. I've been sick all day. Do I have to help myself? I'm sorry. Mr. Buchanan, I was wondering when you'd let me have that blue car of yours. How do you like this one? I bought it last week. It's a nice yellow one. Like to buy it, would you? Big chance. No, but I could use the other. I need money pretty bad right now. My wife and I want to go West. Your wife wants to go? I just got wised up to something funny the last few days. That's why I need the... That's why I want to go away. That's why I've been bothering you about that car. That's enough gas. How much do I owe you? $1.20. I'll let you have that car. I'll send it around tomorrow afternoon. I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone's away. There's something very sensuous about it... overripe as if all sorts of funny fruits were gonna fall into your hands. Where are we going? How about the movies? Oh, it's too hot. You go. We'll drive around and meet you after. We'll meet you on some corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes. Well, obviously, we can't argue about it here, so you follow me to the Plaza Hotel. We can order five bathrooms and take cold baths. Oh, me. Open another window. There aren't any more. Well, we better telephone room service for an ax. The thing to do is to forget about the heat. You just make it ten times worse by crabbing about it. Why not let her alone, old sport? You're the one who wanted to come to town. That certainly is a great expression of yours. What is? Oh, that "old sport" business. Where did you pick that up? Tom, if you're going to make personal remarks, I won't stay here a minute. Imagine marrying anyone in this heat. I was married in June. Mr. Gatsby, I understand that you're an Oxford man. Not exactly. No, no. I understood that you went to Oxford. I went there, yes. Mm-hmm. It was an opportunity they gave some of the officers after the Armistice. Were you in the war, Mr. Buchanan? No, I wasn't in the war. I'd like to know what kind of row it is you're trying to cause in my house. He isn't causing a row. You're causing a row. Please, have a little self-control. Self-control? Have a little self-control? I suppose the latest thing is to just sit back and relax while Mr. Nobody from Nowhere makes love to your wife. Is that it? Well, if that is it, Daisy, count me out. Because let me make myself clear about one thing. Nowadays, people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and before you know it, they'll throw all that overboard, and we'll have intermarriage between black and white. We're all white here. I've got something to tell you, old sport. Oh, please, don't. No, Daisy, listen. Oh, please. Let's all go home. - No, no. - Let's all go home, please. Nobody's going home. I'm going to sit down right here... and I'll listen to what it is that Mr. Gatsby has to tell me. Yes. Thank you. Sir. Well... Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me. You must be crazy. The only reason she married you was because I was poor, and she was tired of waiting, and that was a mistake. But in her heart, she's never loved anyone except me. Now that's a goddamn lie. Sit down, Jordan, Nick. Daisy loved me when she married me, - and she loves me now. - No. And what's more, I love her now. I'll admit that every now and then she gets a little confused and gets involved in things she doesn't really understand. But I also have been known to go off on a spree or two in my life and make a goddamn fool of myself, but I have always come back, and in my heart, I always love her. You are revolting! Do you remember why we left Chicago? Huh? I'm surprised you don't tell the story of that little spree of yours. Daisy, just tell him the truth. Just tell him. Tell him you never loved him, and it'll all be wiped out, forever. Why... how could I love him... possibly? I nev... You never loved him. I never loved him. Not on our honeymoon? No! And not that day that I picked you up in my arms, and I carried you... all the way down from the Punch Bowl so that your little feet wouldn't even get wet? Open a window. Daisy. Daisy, I love you. Oh, please, don't. Oh! You want too much! I love you now... isn't that enough? I can't help what's passed. I did love him once, but I loved you, too. You loved me... too? There are things between Daisy and me that you'll never know... things that neither one of us can ever forget. Darling, I'm going to take better care of you from now on, too. You don't seem to understand. You're not going to take care of her anymore. I'm not? Why is that? Daisy's leaving you. I am, though. No... She's not leaving me... certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring to put on her finger. No! - No! - Daisy! Daisy. And I know what your drugstores are! He and Meyer Wolfsheim bought up street drugstores here and in East Chicago to sell alcohol over the counter! But the drugstores are just small change! He's got something new with Wolfsheim now... something everyone's afraid to talk about! Well, he's lost her now. Want any of this stuff? Nick? Jordan? - Nick? - What? Want any? No. This presumptuous little flirtation is over. I just realized... He doesn't know her like I know her. ...today is my birthday. I'm 30. Give me that key! Give me that key! You stay right here until we go West, Myrtle, like you always wanted. I never wanted to go anywhere with you! You were crazy about going West, Myrtle. Crazy?! The only crazy I was was when I married you! You did marry me, Myrtle. I thought you were a gentleman. Wasn't till afterwards I found out you weren't fit to lick my shoe. Myrtle... You didn't even have your own suit to get married in, and you never even told me! I couldn't help it because I couldn't afford to buy a suit. What you're trying to do is not right, Myrtle. I'm a trusting kind of fella. I don't think no harm in nobody, but when I know a thing, I know it. Maybe you think you can fool me, Myrtle. Maybe you can... ...but you can't fool God. God sees everything. That's an advertisement. You're so dumb you don't know you're alive. I'm not so dumb that I don't know what's right from what's wrong. Myrtle! Are you all right? - Myrtle, are you okay? - Get away from me! Ooh, Myrtle, stop. No, no. No. Don't. A wreck. That's good. Wilson'll finally have some business at last. We'll just pull in and have a look. Just a look. I just know I saw somebody. - M-A-V-O... - No, no... R. Mavrog. - R-O... - Listen to me. - G. - Could you listen to me? - What do you want, fella? - I want to know what happened. And auto hit her... instantly killed. She ran into the road. Son of a bitch didn't even stop his car. There was two cars: One coming, one going, see? Going where? One going each way. Oh, God, oh, God. Please. God. Please... It was a big yellow car. A big yellow car, uh... it's new. You see the accident? - Yeah, I seen it... - Hold it just a minute. No, but the car passed down the road going faster than 40... going 50, 60. He going through there fast. That's right. He left real fast. Which-which way did the car go? Oh, God. Oh, God. My... God. Oh. Oh. Come on, let's get out of here. Her left breast was torn off. Son of a bitch. He didn't even stop his car. You know that? Daisy's home. Nick, why don't you come on in and let them get you something to eat, and then you can take the car on... home. There's nothing more we can do tonight. Won't you come in, Nick? No. Nick... Good night, Nick. Good night. What are you doing? Just standing here. Did you see any trouble on the road? Yes. - Was she killed? - Yes. I thought so. I told Daisy I thought so. Why didn't you stop? It was a terrible shock for Daisy. Daisy? Christ. I just want to wait here and make sure he doesn't try to bother her. He won't touch her. He's not thinking about her. I don't trust him, old sport. I'll wait all night, if necessary. Maybe you got some friend I could telephone for, George? I knew there was something. You got a church you go to sometimes? I knew it that time she came back from New York with her nose all busted and bleeding. Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over. To talk to you, see? I don't belong to any. Oh. You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must've gone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? A long time ago. Look in that drawer there. She had it wrapped up in tissue paper in a place where she hides things. We ain't got a dog. She ain't got a dog. She's got a dog leash with diamonds on it. Oh, my God. He killed her. Who killed her, George? He murdered her. It was an accident. It was the man in the car. She said he was coming for her. Then he didn't stop. Maybe I ought to call up the church. Which church should I call, George? I'll go find out some names of churches, George. I told her... God sees everything. I'll read some names of churches. I'm sorry. I'll take it back. All right? I'll make it right. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. Nick. Nothing happened. I waited till about 4:00, she came to the window... just stood a minute and then turned out the light. Have you got a cigarette? Just one. We'll share it. Can you imagine what this old island must've looked like to those Dutch sailors when they first saw it? Fresh green. Like a dream of a new world. They must've held their breath, afraid it would disappear before they could touch it. You didn't see that woman? Christ, Gatsby, she was ripped open and you drove off. All I can see is Daisy. All I can think about is Daisy. God, she was so frightened. I tried to grab for the wheel, but she... It was Daisy? Daisy was driving? She was very nervous when we left New York. She thought it would help steady her to drive. This woman rushed out at us. It all happened in a second. It... it seemed she recognized the car. It seemed like she wanted to... to speak to us. Thought... thought we were somebody that she knew. Daisy's never really needed me before, don't you see? I don't think she ever loved him. That house of hers in Louisville... it's the most beautiful house I'd ever seen. All that... crystal and... silver. It was full of a kind of... It was... a bit... You must remember, old sport, that she was very excited. He tried to make me look like some kind of cheap sharper. She didn't know what she was saying. Of course, she might have loved him... for a minute, when they were first married. But loved me more even then, you see? In any case, it was just personal. I think you ought to go away for awhile. Up to Montreal, or someplace safe. Go away? Now? Just till it all blows over. I can't leave. She'll be coming just as soon as she can get away. I suppose so. You stay right there. I'll handle this. Who is that man, do you know? That's Mr. Wilson, ma'am, from the garage up by the big sign. Now, Pammy, you must wear that dress. I won't! Come along, you must do as you're told. If you don't, I shall tell your mama. Mama, Mama! I won't, I won't! Mommy, Mommy, I don't want to wear this dress. I hate this color, I hate this color. Hush, bless you, hush. Just don't cry. Don't cry. Beautiful little fools can wear whatever color they like. Summer's almost over. Sad, isn't it? Makes you want to... I don't know, reach out and... hold it back. There'll be other summers. How about a swim? Maybe later. Hmm. I'll give you a call around noon. Fine, old sport. I'll be at the pool. Nick? Thank you. They're a rotten crowd. You're worth the whole damn bunch put together. ♪ When you and I were 17 ♪ ♪ And life and love were new ♪ ♪ The world was just a field of green ♪ ♪ 'Neath smiling skies of blue ♪ ♪ That golden spring when I was king ♪ ♪ And you, my wonderful queen ♪ ♪ Do you recall when love was all ♪ ♪ When we were 17? ♪ Daisy? Daisy? I will remember the rest of that day only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspapermen in and out of Gatsby's house. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered openmouthed about the pool. Mrs. Buchanan, please. We'll have to get instructions from someone. We haven't been able to locate any next of kin. Well, there's a West Egg ordinance... - When do you expect her? - Just a moment. In three days, that body gets shipped... I'll give the instructions. - Who's this? - He's a neighbor. Have you any idea how I can reach them? - What neighbor? - Next door. I was his friend. Thank you. All I could think of was his extraordinary gift for hope: A romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person, and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. The following day, I phoned Wolfsheim. I was sure he would come to the funeral, but all he said was, "Let us learn to show our friendship for a man "when he is alive, and not after he is dead. After that, my rule is to let everything alone." I remembered him saying that before. But I was waiting for a letter or a phone call from Daisy. Is this... Is this... my son's house? I saw it in the Chicago newspapers. He was in all the Chicago newspapers. L-I didn't know how to reach you, Mr. Gatsby. Course... we was... broke up... when he run... from home... but I see now... there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. Ever since he... made a success... he was very generous to me. He was only a young man... ...but he had a lot of brain power... here. If he'd lived... he'd have helped... build up the country. Yes, that's true. It just... It just shows you how his... It just shows you. Who is this girl? I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby. Gatz is my name. Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West. Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose to his position in the East. He had a lot of friends here. Are you one of his friends, Mister, uh... We were close friends. I found this. It's a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you. Schedule... of resolves. One: Practice elocution... poise... and how to attain it. Two: Study... needed... inventions. Three: Save $5. He crossed that out... to $3 per week. Four: No more smoking or chewing. Five: Be better to parents. One God, world without end. Amen. She didn't send flowers. No message... nothing. How could she, Nick? She could've done something if she wanted to. They're careless people... Tom and Daisy. They smash things up, and then they retreat back into their money, or... their vast carelessness, or whatever it is that keeps them together... leaving other people to clean up the mess. I had lunch with them today. - Oh? - They're staying here. They're going to Europe for a few weeks while the new house is being prepared. I'm going away, too... only I'm going back West. I'm too squeamish and provincial for the East. Is that why you threw me over? Something about... bad drivers? And taking two to make an accident. Nick, how are you? Nice to see you. Aren't you going to shake my hand? What's the matter with him? What did you tell Wilson, Tom? Wilson? I told him the truth. If I hadn't told him who owned the car, he would've killed me. Nick... Gatsby had it coming to him. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even bothered to stop his car. Nick... I've had my share of suffering, too, you know. I went back to Myrtle's flat... and I looked at that little box of dog biscuits, and I sat down and cried like a baby. Tom... don't you realize...? Nick? Nick. How lovely to see you. L-l-I've been meaning to call you for days, but l-I've been so busy with the new house... you can't imagine. You have to promise to come and see us just as soon as we get back. You'll be our first guest. Promise. We've got to go, darling. - Nick... See you, Jordan. - You know how I love to see you at my table. Oh, Daisy. I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this lawn, and his dream must've seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him. ♪ Ev'ry morning, ev'ry evening, ain't we got fun? ♪ Not much money, oh, but, honey, ain't we got fun? ♪ The rent's unpaid, dear, We haven't a bus ♪ But smiles were made, dear, for people like us ♪ In the winter, in the summer, don't we have fun? ♪ Times are bum and getting bummer, still we have fun ♪ There's nothing surer, the rich get rich and the poor get children ♪ In the meantime, in between time, ain't we got fun? ♪ Landlord's mad and getting madder, ain't we got fun? ♪ Times are bad and getting badder, still we have fun! ♪ There's nothing surer, the rich get rich and the poor get laid off ♪ In the meantime, in between time, ain't we got fun? ♪ ♪ When you and I were seventeen ♪ And life and love were new ♪ The world was just a field of green ♪ 'Neath the smiling skies of blue ♪
