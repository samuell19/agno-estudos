We are students of kung fu. We'll make masters out of you. Hoo, ha, hiyah. Hoo, ha, hiya. Welcome to the Birch Knows Kung Fu dojo. Hello? Sorry, I'm just looking. No problem. Aren't they great? Spectacular. Yeah, aren't they? So, what can I do for you? What... Shh. Just let me enjoy this a little bit longer. Hoo, ha, hiyah! We know all secret moves. Sorry, you were saying? No problem. Are you here for the free lesson? Mm-hm. Sensei Birch? Sensei Birch, this... gentleman is inquiring about the free lesson. Yes, hello, welcome to Sensei Birch Knows Kung Fu dojo. So you're here for a free lesson? Yes. I'm interested in learning some kung fu here, Sensei Bitch. Haha, that's Birch, Sensei Birch. I mean Sensei Birch. Yes, I want to learn after school. All are welcome who want to train here and learn our art. So, tell us, why do you want to learn? What should I say to her? Um, how about, I can be stronger with confidence? No. How about to learn the way of the Bushido and be humble? No, that's not worldly enough. Oh, how about to learn the Asian culture and history? No, that's too lame. Come on, think. Maybe to have self-respect and discipline. No. Oh, I know! And to avenge my mother. She was murdered while she was protecting me from the Triads! I'm sorry. I don't think this is the school for you. We don't teach revenge here. I think you need to go to a different dojo. You have the wrong school. No! I want you! I mean, I need you, to teach me more. I mean, I already know some kung fu already. I just need you to give me that extra oomph so I can get to the next level. I'm sorry, sir. This is not the school for you. If you could please go... No, I won't go! Why does he keep interrupting me? Please, Sensei Bitch, I mean Birch, please enlighten me. I need to learn more. Unless you think I'm better than everyone here, or may be you've got nothing more to teach me. You know, you sure talk a lot. And you interrupt a lot! I'll tell you what, here's the deal. If you can beat one of my students, or shall I say interrupt them, then you can train here. Easy. Bring it on. Students. Gather round. Melody, come here. I want you to take it easy on him, okay? Okay. What the? You want me to seriously, you want me to fight her? She's a girl! You said you were good. - But she's a girl! - So show me if you can. Deal, or no deal. Fine. Please go easy on me. You may leave now. I'm absolutely certain that I can create some amazing artwork for your school. Thank you, Stella. Your art would look great on the walls of the dojo. Hmm, very inspiring. Thank you. Thank you again. Just give me a call when the piece is ready to be picked up. Absolutely. Thanks. Thanks. - Have a good day. - You too. Where the hell did you come from? I got you now! Last time was a cheap shot, making me fight a little girl. But this time I'm ready. Where is that Sensei Bitch? Laura. I think you can handle this situation. All right. I'll be back. So we're thinking about doing a two-for-one kind of deal. Okay, I'm ready this time. Where's that Sensei Bitch? Do you mind waiting until we're done eating? Do you want to join us? Here, have a seat. It's good, right? Glad you're enjoying the food. We always come here. So, Ed... Why do you really want to learn kung fu? When I was growing up, I was so different. I was always slower than everybody else. I didn't know anyone, and I didn't fit in, so I found comfort watching martial art movies. When we moved here, I was looking forward to school. I was looking forward to meeting new friends. Who knew that it wouldn't work out? People just ignored me. So I started to watch more kung fu movies and learned from their moves, trying to learn something. While at school, I just kept getting harassed and bullied. Even during our school road trips, kids would keep making fun of me for how slow I was and not knowing how things worked. I was a nobody that got blamed and pushed around a lot. I got so tired of it that I continued learning kung fu from home, watching from the TV, hoping to have more confidence so that people would like me and go bother someone else for a change. And maybe, just maybe, I could make one single friend, or more. But that failed. After high school, we all got an internship at a local photography studio. I was so happy, but only for a split second. Edward Ralph Turtle, come here! I need four copies of this right away! Stat! Come on! Come on, time is money! Let's go! My colleagues and even my boss started to make fun of me, because I was so slow and because I was so different. Put that book away! Come on! Unbelievable! Figure it out! So I wanted to learn kung fu even more, to become a real master and beat everyone that makes fun of me, or at least anyone that tries to make fun of me in the future. I won't take it! That's no way to learn any martial art because... ♪ Once I was afraid I was petrified ♪ ♪ Thought I was alone no one by my side ♪ ♪ Then I learned kung fu completely on my own ♪ ♪ Wasn't until I met Miss Birch I found I wasn't alone ♪ ♪ I'm her guiding light when she's in the dark ♪ ♪ Never been an opponent that we could not shark ♪ ♪ If you think I'm a nobody I'll show you who I am ♪ ♪ I'm a somebody with two guns baby ♪ ♪ And those guns are my hands All right, all right, enough talking, more eating. Ed, have some more chickens feet. And some tea to wash that down. Yup. Great. All right. So let's eat up. So... I sense trouble. Let's not get involved. We have class starting in 10 minutes and we need to get back to the school. Okay, today is my lucky day. Where is she? Not today, Ed. We need to get back to... Ha ta ta ta ta! I've been practicing all day yesterday. Sensei Bitch is going down. Where is she? Ed. What are you doing? I'm here to prove that I can beat 'em all. I want to see that, yeah. After I'm done beating all of them, you're next! You do remember what happened like a couple weeks back, yeah? I don't even need to beat you. In fact, Sensei Dave over here, well, he can even beat you too. He can mop the floor with you. Sensei Dave, huh? Who in the hell does he think he is? Master of the universe?

Sean, you are awesome. I never understood why you had to be so vicious when you were already so good. I mean, I think it's because you wanted me to get better, but I thought you were training me, you wanted to make me stronger, and that's why I followed you. Did you really look up to me? I'm sorry I was a jerk, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being mean to you, man. You know what? No sweat. Come here. This is incredible, man. This just came out. How do you have a copy? I actually met the main actor online and he gave me this copy when I told him I'm gonna be a great kung fu master. That's awesome, dude. That's great. Ed, are you in there? Oh, hi, mom! Oh, I see you have a friend over. Miss Peterson. At least now you aren't all alone doing god knows what. Anyway, Ed, meet Peter. Peter, this is my son Ed. I don't think you guys ever met before, since we're always... busy. Nice firm grip. You must work out. Him? Work out? All he does is sit in front of the TV doing dirty things.

Don't wait up. Hey, Ed. Hey, Sean. Where you going? I'm just heading to the dojo. Dojo? To kick my ass again? No, I'm not kicking your ass. You're not a mule. What? Can I come with you? You want to learn some kung fu? Sure. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool. Come on. Cool. Hey, I'll see you guys later, okay? Sensei Bitch. Sensei Birch. Just call me Sensei. Master. I want to learn kung fu. How much would it be for... Uhuh. Money is not the answer to everything. What do you want to learn? I want to be like him. I want any better than him actually. Okay. Then you can start with this. Cleaning. Wipe on. Wipe off. Wipe on. Wipe off. Breathe in. Breathe out. Eyes up front. Back stiff straight. Do not stand with that gait. Do as I do. Do as I say. Are you crazy? Put that phone away! And I don't want to excuses, especially not from the clueless. Can I even make a hero of you? It's gonna be a challenge. We must conclude... Stop! This story's about me! I'm here to learn, Sensei Bitch. Birch. I'm here to learn, Sensei Birch. Yeah? Woo hoo hoo! What? I'm the master! Bitch, give me somebody else to beat up. Let's go. Ed! What are you doing? He'll be all right. He just needs some rest. You two, take him to the back. Ah! Ah, come on, he's not done yet. Come on, mutton chops, one more round. Let's go, let's go. All right, okay, fine. I beat you. You remember that. Who's next? You, ah, you're too skinny. You, ah, you're too short. You, nah, GPAs too low. You got gloves on. Let's go. Come on. Ed, you better stop. What?

Harmony my arse! Ed said this school is better than mine. Are you a friend of Ed's? Friend? No, I'm his father. And I heard what the school treated him. And I'm here to make sure I teach you all a lesson. Sir, we did nothing wrong. We simply asked Ed to leave. This is not a school of vengeance or of bullying. Regardless, I'm not leaving until I teach you all a lesson. I guess there's only one way to settle things with you. Come. That's all you got? Come on! Get off me! Guess you've learned your lesson. You need to be training in my dojo. This school can't teach you anything. In fact, I'll give each of you 50% off for first year. Just have to follow me now. Why didn't you help her out?

Quit wasting time on this loser. Yeah, and we can hit up my dad's school. Maybe he can give me some pointers or two. Mary, this is a great dinner. Oh, yes. Our little family all together at once. Ed, why are you playing with your food? Ed? Edward! What? What's wrong? Nothing. So, Ed, how do you like my school? It's an awesome school. Seeing all of the students learning over there. And I can't thank you enough for letting me teach them some of my moves. Oh? He's teaching there now? Mm-hm. Well, not officially, but seeing that he is a black belt, I figured I'd let him teach a bit. I loved it. Thanks. I'm gonna teach them to become great students. Look, they were all paying attention, learning new moves. Ed was teaching. They even tried my moves during the sparring sessions. And of course none of them dared to spar with me. No, that's because they all know they can't win. That's right. They know you're a great warrior, and they know you know great kung fu. And that Sensei Birch, I don't know what she's teaching, 'cause obviously none of those students are learning a thing. Personally, I thought she learned all her kung fu from like a cereal box. What's that Dave guy about? Isn't he supposed to be Sensei Birch's teacher or something? Mm-hm. Yeah. You know, I don't think he knows any martial arts, and that's why he never fights. No, he does. How do you know? I've seen it, when he helped me. But does he teach there? No, no, he just walks around mopping the floor. I don't know, maybe he's just got OCD, or maybe he's got nothing better... You know what? I bet you he's bored, he's just bored. He's literally always cleaning. He probably needs to get laid more often. But since he cleans all the time, maybe he could come clean the house. That's probably the only skill he knows. You know, I wonder if I should challenge him. You know, show him who's boss. You know what? You should, you should. You know why? 'Cause dad wouldn't even want to challenge you. That's right. No, you're great. And again, I'm getting too old to be fighting all this. But you know, I don't think you can beat Dave. How do you know? Well, I'm just guessing. He's never challenged you. Or, alternatively, maybe he just doesn't think you're worth it. Not worth it? I beat all his students! I'm teaching at Peter's school! How am I not worth it? He just thinks you're a little fly on the wall that he can swat away. Ed, be respectful at the table. We have guests. Seriously, though. Can you beat him though? I don't... I can. He's too weak. He doesn't practice much, so he's no match for me. Ed, calm down!

That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. Sifu? Sifu. I am worried about Ed. Oh. It's not like him. I mean, he's neurotic and everything, but he would not, like, hurt people who wants to help him. His eagerness the show that he's better. His need want to fit in. That's the real issue. What? He's always been a loner, right? No friends growing up? And you always harassed him, bullied him. Then he created a barrier. Barrier. Remember when you were a child, wondering about the world with curiosity, a little fear, asking random questions, exploring new possibilities? And then you got older, and people started to say, "No, you can't do that." "You should focus on this instead." And then they start to label you as introvert, extrovert, stubborn or weak. And maybe they even bully you because you can't live up to a certain standard. All of these bump ups make you want to create a barrier. We all have these barriers that protect our authentic self. Think of it this way. It's like wrapping multiple blankets around yourself when you're a child to protect yourself from the monsters under the bed. But those monsters now are people. At the core, you're still the same child, but you behave differently because you have all these layers you carry around with you to protect yourself. So, now you're more a product of, you know, a reflection of your circumstances than your true authentic self. Then what should we do? I mean, we can't let him fall down the rabbit hole. No, we won't let that happen. But I have a feeling everything's gonna work out soon. How do you know? You psychic? I like the new drone. Yeah? This one is for speed and racing, but this one is more suitable and stable to be a filmmaker. Yeah, he's try to be a filmmaker to make millions. Nothing wrong with dreaming big. What else can this thing do? You can race it. There's like really cool things where they like race through at night. Be careful. Wasting time, I see. So, is Dave at the dojo? Ed, what is this? I'm going to challenge him. You know, show him who's the boss. He's your teacher, man. He's not my teacher! He didn't teach me shit! But once I beat him, everyone will know that I'm the greatest. Dude, you don't have to prove anything to anyone, man. He sure does! Dave's been holding him back. Ed, ignore them. Let's get back to the dojo. You'll have to fight me then. Don't be silly. You're no match for me. Hey Ed, why don't you use him for warmup? Maybe teach him a lesson or two. Yeah, like how he always bullied you. Show him how it's done now. Ed, I'm sorry for what I've done. It was messed up. But this doesn't make it right. Save it! Your whole life, you always thought you were on top while you looked down at the rest of us. You think your still better than me? No, I just... All right, I guess I'm just gonna have to teach you a lesson. Get him! Think I can't beat you? That's ridiculous! Woo! I'm the best! Yes, you are. Dude, that was amazing. I cannot believe you could do that! Call Sifu. Yeah, go warn him. Go ahead. Hey, it's me. You gotta head over to the dojo quick. Ed's on his way to challenge Dave. You gotta warn Sensei Birch. Hurry. Yeah, let 'em know that Master Ed's coming to beat them up! Let's go. Let's do it! Just like I thought. And still pathetic. Sir. You won, okay? There's no reason to return to humiliate us. But it's so much fun. However, this time... it's not me. Ed. Ed? Sensei Birch. Nice to see you. Hope all is well. Anyways, where's Dave? He's here. Is there something I can help you with? No. I'm here to challenge him. You know this is not right. Be respectful! Ed, he's avoiding you, because he knows he's better than you. Junior, you're right. He thinks he's wasting time fighting you. No! I want to fight him right now! You hear me? I want to fight him right now, or I'm tearing this place apart! No need to fight over me. Ah, you're Dave. Yeah, you can defeat him no problem. You got this. Ed, how you been? Sifu. Oh, okay. I'm just here to, uh... No need to rush. Take a deep breath. Breathe. I'm here. Ed, this is your time.

Ed! Get yourself together! No! I won't fight him. Dave's never hurt me before. But he won't fight you, so he thinks he's better! No! It's not because he thinks he's better. It's because he knows he doesn't have to. Sean! I'm so sorry for what I did. Are you okay? Sifu, did you guys fight already? Seafood here, seafood there. Who's cooking? This is ridiculous! I came to see a fight, not a makeup love story. No! We don't need to fight! I understand now. It only makes things worse, Junior! Understand what? That he's better than you? That you never... That you... That you always had someone around you, so you were never alone? That you took Sean away from me? What? Drama! We were good friends. When you moved to town, you were so weird, and everyone hated you. And Sean hated you so much that he quit talking to me. 'Cause all he wanted to do was hurt you. Stat! Come on! Come on, time is money! Let's go! You're impossible! Put that away! We don't have time for that! Figure it out! You have gotten slower, if that's even possible. Yeah, we were like brothers, and then you came in and destroyed everything. So I got depressed, and so my dad sent me to a "hospital". I stayed there ever since. We were so close. We could have beat Dave and that Sensei Bitch. And my dad would have married Ed's mom, and then he and I would legally be brothers, so I'd finally have a friend. You. And you will finally be alone, so you'll know how it feels Sean. 'Cause that's the plan. You will finally understand what it is like to be alone. Junior, you're weird. All this happened years ago, years ago, man. Let it go, get some help, and chill. He's got a lot of anger. I think he needs a hug. You know what? Enough of this sentimental crap! This is boring. I came here to see a show, people. Hey, I got an idea. I say we beat 'em all up. That sounds like a good idea, dad. Yeah, but we're gonna have to leave Ed out of this. I wouldn't know what to tell his mommy. Okay. Let me. I think it's time. Welcome home, Ed. Man, I am so sick of this sentimental garbage. Hey, Junior. Watch your pops beat him like a volleyball. You got this, dad! Not bad for a janitor. But then again, I'm just getting warmed up. See that? Shh! Dad, you okay? Shut up! Okay. It's just like dancing. It is. Dad? Dad, I think that um... What? That I'm not good enough? You're still a pathetic idiot! Don't you see I got him bouncing around? Like a bouncing ball! I think it's time for him to leave. Not while I still have the upper hand. Sensei! I can't move! I can't move! What kind of magic is this? Why can't I move? Pressure points, my friend. No magic. Pressure points. It's time for you to leave. Dad! That was so cool! Sifu, wow! Wait, can you teach us? How'd you do it? How'd you do that? - I wanna learn that. - Now. - Can we do that? - Please. - Please. - Today? Where'd you learn that from? Ancient Chinese secret. What! Hey Sean, you get out much? Ed, you gotta be the moves man. Be the moves. All right, let's do this. Oh, what are you guys watching? A movie. Oh, thanks mom. OMG. He's polite! I don't know what you did, but I like it. We're watching a movie.

I don't know my lines. Damn! Master, I just saw Sean a couple... Everyone will know that I'm the greatest. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. Cut. Going to to a dojo so you can kick my ass again? Ed, ignore them. Let's get to the dojo to. God! I can't beat you? That's ridiculous! What the just happened? I slipped on ice cream. Down. And push. You know it's supposed to be the other way, right? Block. No, you're great. Don't know my frickin' line, but you are great. He's too weak. He doesn't practice much, and he's no match for me.
