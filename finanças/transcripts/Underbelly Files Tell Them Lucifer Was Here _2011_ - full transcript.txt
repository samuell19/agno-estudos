MAN [VOICEOVER]: This is a sad and tragic day for all Victoria. MAN [VOICEOVER]: It's a jobwhere you send them out to it. There's always an elementof danger, however, you just expect them to come home again. And on this occasion, they didn't. MAN [VOICEOVER]: All they were doing in the early hours of Sundaywas going about their duties, protecting the public of Victoria. NEWSCASTER: The officers weresearching for armed robbers as part of a special operation when they were gunned down in suburban Moorabbin just after 12:30 this morning. NEWSCASTER: Mr. Comrie described the murders as a shocking attack on law and order by desperate and dangerous people. NEWSCASTER: Police have warnedthe killer is almost certain to be desperate and dangerous. NARRATOR: Melbourne, 1998. On a cold winter's nightin the suburb of Moorabbin, two young policemen with everything to live for were executed in cold blood. This is the story of the hunt for their killers. [theme music] SONG: It's a jungle out there. I recommend center half-forward. I mean, everybody loves you, but you're not under pressure to score abig bag of goals like the full forward. Then again, if you want the exercise, you could always be an on-baller. I mean, those blokesmust run 10 miles a game. Basically, it comes down to size, mate. If you're 6'3 and I've gotthe Richmond scout knocking on my door, I'm gonna say, "My son Jimmy is a key position man." Shame if James wants to be a ballet dancer. Ah, now, now, Mum, don'tgo getting ideas in his head. Oh. You really have to work tonight? Well, show me how to lightthe pilot light before you go. I'll do it. I should know how to do it. And what do you think I'm here for? OK, listen up. I'm Mark Butterworth, armed robbery squad. Welcome to operation Hamada. Tonight, you good and soberpolicemen of C District are gonna help us catch twovery bad crooks, who've been running wild for seven years. It all started on a Friday night. Get on the ground! Put your fucking money!Open the till, open the till! Pull it out! There were two of them wearing masks, presidents Nixon and Reagan. Although they also do gorillas,balaclavas, pantyhose, baseball caps, et cetera. Face down, hands behind your back! Get down there now! Get on the fucking ground! Job one, they lifted sevengrand, and in the process put the fear of God into the staff. Yeah, not if they're Buddhists, Mark. Buddhist don't believe in God. Thanks for that nugget, Sergeant Silk. During the next threeyears, they struck 28 times that we know of. If this all there is, huh? Well, you'd better raise your prices, mate! Then they went quiet for some reason. And three years later, they are back. Same MO. They strike late, tiepeople up with duct tape, scare 'em shitless. Ha! What have we got here? Let's see how Vietnamese tick. Months ago, they hit theGreen Papaya in Surrey Hills. Very interesting. The older bloke, the talker, he gave the manager a message for us. When the cops turn up,tell 'e Lucifer was here. Law of averages, they'redue to strike this weekend. So you lot are gonna spend your Saturday night staking out theseestablishments in case they do. It's a miracle Lucifer and his mate haven't killed anybody yet. We don't stop them, then they surely will. Couple of crooks in there,stuffing their ugly faces. What, our guys? No, think they went for a deal. Eastern European, Lebanese. Remind me to an intel report later, eh? Hmm. Sorry I didn't mention it. How's the new bub? Brilliant. Just-- Yeah? You ought to try it. I don't think I've metthe mother of my kids yet. Really? A man with your style? I mean, I thought you'd beknocking them off with a stick. Mate, I carry two stickswith me at all times. Oh, bugger. Looks like we're out of luck. What do you wanna do? Do you wanna take early markor lend a hand elsewhere? You know me, Gary. I live to serve. You boys getting lonely? Hey, you catch the final score, Frankie? You owe me $10. 35 points, eh? Hey, there's another entrancefrom the underground car park. Anything could be going on down there. Sounds like us. All right, sayonara, ladies. All righty. Wanna see his picture? Oh, look at this one. Hey, look at him. Gets his looks for his mum. Yeah? I didn't realize Carmel was bald. [laughter] Gentlemen, we've got company. [siren wailing] Moorabbin 403, you boys need a hand? Moorabbin 403, stay where you are. Come on, it's gotta be our guys. - You get the rego, Gary?- Negative. Can't get close enough. They must be running on rocket fuel. 404 to 403. They've given us the slip. We're heading back. It must have been our guys. Look, maybe not. Maybe our guys are back atthe Silky Emperor right now. Come on, let it go, Rod. Let's just go back and check it out. Is that barbecue pork I can smell? Jeez, I'm hungry, mate. Frank, shut up. Oh, shit. He's back for a second go. No, that's a different car. It's the same bloody Honda, Frank. Mate, that is a Hyundai. Moorabbin 403 to Moorabbin 404,there is a dark-colored Hyundai coming down the ramp. Heads up, boys. Look how slow this guy's going. He's on the prowl for sure. Give them a hand? If they want our help,they'll ask for it, mate. 404 to 403, we've justturned into Cochranes Road. Looks like a single occupant. We're gonna pull him over. Twiddle our thumbs, then. Yep, single occupant. Not our night. G'day, mate. How are you? [gunshots] Jesus, Frank, they're shooting at 'em! Moorabbin 403, shots fired in Moorabbin. Shots fired in Moorabbin. Repeat, shots fired inCochranes Road, Moorabbin. Please acknowledge. DISPATCH: Moorabbin 403. Repeat please. Did you say shots fired? Christ, he's dead. Where's Rod? Roddy? Rod! Rod Miller! Oh, shit. His gun's still in the holster. Maybe they took him. Moorabbin 403, we got onemember down, one member missing. [radio chatter] So where'd Rod Miller? I want him bloody found! MAN [ON RADIO]: Moorabbin406, we have possibly a dark-colored small car. [coughing] Oi, over here! He's over here! Help. Can't breathe. Fucked. I'm gonna die. You're not gonna die. You're gonna be fine, mate. There was two of them. One was-- one was on foot. Six foot. Chequered shirt. Uh-huh. Dark Hyundai. Right. MAN [ON RADIO]: Cheltenham 206. The ambulance has clearedwith the second member. MAN [ON RADIO]: Roger Cheltenham 206. The second member has been transported away The road's closed, mate. What's your business here? I'm in charge. Inspector. Sergeant. It's our fault. Hamada was an Armed Robbery operation. We drafted these men from normal duties. We put them in danger. Goes with the job. Unacceptable danger. What do we not so far? Moorabbin 403 got a glimpse of the driver as they drove out of the car park. He was medium build, shoulder-length hair, three-day stubble, European,possibly Middle Eastern. 170 centimeters, althoughRod Miller said six foot. I said he looked relaxed. That's it. Fuck all. Where's his day book. I could have taken it,some kind of souvenir maybe. I don't know. This windscreen glass, from the killer's car? We're guessing Rod Miller took a shot at them as they drove off. They didn't radio in? No, we weren't using intergraph. We were on 52DVP for security's sake. In case you bandits had scanners? Trying to keep traffic to a minimum. Do you mind? What? No. I used to write downrego numbers on my hands. Nothing. [baby crying] Mrs. Miller? Sorry to wake you. I was awake. What's wrong? Detective inspector, what aterrible, terrible night, sir. Sir, Graeme, Paul. Thinking about Walsh Street. Hmm. It's been 10 years since timeTynan and Eyre were murdered. I know. History repeats. I want you to head up a task force. Sir, I'm the duty inspector tonight. There are others far more experienced. You're the best investigatorin the state, Paul. Pick your own team, run it your own way. We'll back 100%. We can't afford anotherfailure like Walsh Street. You will catch these men. MAN [ON RADIO]: Attention, please. To all members on this channel,I am sorry to report to you that Senior Constable RodneyMiller died at the Monash Medical Center at 0439 hours. You will catch these men. I would like you aboardLorima, if you're willing. You'd be running your own crew, reporting to me and Graeme Collins. Thank you. Dean Thomas is onboard. Is that Bull Thomas's boy?How old is he? He's old enough. Donald, you know Graeme Collins, my 2IC? Graeme. How are you? So any developments, Paul? It's early days. Just wanna let you know, my boys are ready and willing to man thephones if you're short handed. Special operations group swapping assault rifles for phones.Nice. When can you start? Oh, immediately. Here we go, here we go. NEWSCASTER [ON TV]: From interstate and overseas, family, friends, colleagues,and strangers gathered to farewell Sergeant Gary Silk. It was a heartbreaking return to the academy from which he graduated 13 years ago. Outside, thousands heard IanSilk tell of his brother's dedication to the force. Finally, the ultimate honor, shoulder to shoulder for more than akilometer, hundreds of officers reflected on the ultimate sacrifice they're all at risk of being asked to pay. [SINGING] He will my shield and portion be. NEWSCASTER [ON TV]: Premier Jeff Kennett had for the killers this message. Just be assured that allthe resources of the state will be brought to bear to find you out and to bring you to trial. [SINGING] --endures. I can't promise anarrest, but what I can offer is a guarantee that we willnever stop trying to find them. We can't ask for more than that. Gary wouldn't expect more than that. No, nor would Rod. He understood how difficultinvestigations can be. You know the score. If we don't identify theoffenders within 48 hours, it could take years. I need a team that can runall day, people who never get tired of chasing the ball. Is that you? - Yes. Yes. Yes. Dean Thomas, everyone. Remember, you are working for your mates. Not just Gary Silk and Rod Miller, you're working for everyserving officer in Victoria. You're also working for Constable Damian Eyre and Constable Steve Tynan. You know their names. 10 years ago, they were murdered in cold blood in Walsh Street, South Yarra. And we never locked anyone up for that one. This time we will. I've asked these gentlemen to help us. Introduce yourselves, please. We're from ArmedRobbers, Mark Butterworth. Steve Beanland. Joe D'Alo. Hamada was our op. And before anybody says we're responsible, we already know that. No matter how hard you blokeswork to solve this thing, we'll work harder. That's a promise. Graeme? OK, the first rule of Taskforce Lorimer is to not assume anything. You check everything. You check everything twice. At this moment, we've gottwin lines of inquiry. First of all, we've identifiedthe killer's car as being a dark Hyundai Hatchback. But what's the first rule of Lorimer? Do not assume anything. Right. The second one is whythese gentlemen are here. Catch the restaurant bandits, we catch our killers. Your time starts now. SONG: I'm a snake-charmer, baby. Tin whistle in my hand. [shouting] SONG: Said I'm a snake-charmer, darling. Tin whistle in my hand. Don't move! Get down on the floor! Oh, you didn't do it, huh? Eh? What did you do? I'll tell you what you can fucking do! So nobody knows who these pricks are. Someone does. Wife, girlfriend, fence. We've shut down every crook in Melbourne. Well, all they've gotta do is give us a name and we'll back off. And how can they give them up if they don't know who the hell they are? Huh? I'm taking you back to thenight of Saturday the 15th. So you're parked outside BBC hardware, and you're watching therestaurant across the road. Can you see its name? The Silky Emperor. Can you remember thecar's number plate, Frank? At first, we thought it wasthe same Honda back again, but it was a different car. How tall would you say he was? About 170 centimeters. Shoulder-length, dark hair. There's stubbly growth. 6 foot, check shirt. Yeah. Now, Gary was shot three times. First shot to the chest. Second shot to the pelvis,smashing a vertebrae. Third shot to the skull was fatal. The second and third roundwas from a different gun. Two shooters. Or one man with two guns. Now, Rod was shot once. The bullet entered hisbody under his left armpit and exited at his right hip. Explain the trajectory. Well, the theory is Rod wasat the back of the Hyundai. He had the gunman inside the car, shooting over the top of the front seat through the rear window. First shot smashes the glass. Rod ducks down. Second shot hits him. Anything helpful with the bullets? Twisted out of shape from impacting on bone. They're useless. However, Rod did return four shots, but we've only recovered three, so I figure the final round might have lodged in the Hyundai's bodywork. Too much to hope itlodged in someone's skull. [gunshot] It's definitely a Korean manufacturer. The Japs used a thickerglass and generally tint it. So it's probably a HyundaiExcel, either 3- or 5-door. That's great work, Mick. Thanks. And how many out there? About 35,000 registered in Australia. Wouldn't you be wise to addmore experience to the team? It's all about fresh thinking. Yeah, well, some of themwould like school kids, Paul. It's like a football team. Older players don't alwayswork as hard for the kicks as the young guns. I've told them they'regetting their weekends off and to take leave when it's due. So you're worried about burnout. Well, you can only runon adrenaline for so long. And passion's runningpretty high at the moment. I've sent a team to SouthKorea to research Hyundais. What's that gonna cost? - Uh-- - Fine. It's fine. Whatever you need. Just get me a result, Paul. I went out on a limb for you. July 18th was The Green Papaya, and August 15th the Silky Emperor. Now, The Green Papayawas the Lucifer crack, yes? Yeah. When the cops turn up,tell them Lucifer was here. In July, he throws down a challenge to us. In August, he works up to murder. Does our Lucifer have a grudge against police? Let's look at everybody who has lodged a complaint with ethicalstandards, the ombudsman, that sort of thing. - Yeah. What if these guys aren'tthe restaurant robbers? What if it's unrelated? I mean, they could be, I don't know, interstate drug runners whojust happened to be in the area. Hey, skip. Got a report of a girl whojust bought a replacement rear windscreen for a Hyundai Excel. Ah. That's it. Number 8. [music playing] Detective SergeantRichie, Lorimer Taskforce. Who owns this vehicle? Me, why? And what's your name? Nicole Debs. Nicole, has this vehiclebeen damaged recently? No. Well, then why was a rear windscreen purchased for it yesterday? Look, it was dad who busted it. Your dad? What happened? Yeah, his wagon was in for a service, so he needed to borrow mine to do a tiling job. I don't know what happened. He said, he had these longtiling things, like metal strip things in the back stickingout, slams the hatch on 'em and smashes the window to bits. Well, why didn't yousay so in the first place? So your dad, what's his name? Bandali Debs. Everyone calls him Ben. OK. He's not home. Got his mobile number? He's not got it with him today. You tell him we called. Yeah, don't you worry. I will. I know Bandali Debs. He's nothing. A low level thief. He's a bottom feeder. Yeah, you got him on ahandling charge back in '79. I was in uniform. He must have been in nappies. So, what? Forget about him? - No, Mick. You don't forget about him. You get a statement out ofhim, check every detail twice. [barking] Shut the fuck up! Oi. Oi, quiet, you little bitch! Come here, girl. It's all right. Yeah, me daughter told me you was here. So could you tell us howyou broke the windscreen in that car, Mr. Debs? Yeah, well, my wagon was offthe road, so I had to use hers to do this job over in Jaguar Close. And I had this-- these fucking brasstiling strips in the back. And it was too long for the car. When I slammed thehatch, they went straight through the back window. And when was this? Uh, last Wednesday. What were you doing on the 15th? That was the night them cops got shot. Mm-hmm. Ah, I did a job inNoble Park during the day. And then I think I justkicked back with the family and had a few brews. Any objection if we take alook at your phone records? Why? It's just something we like to do. If I can find them. We'll arrange to pick them up. OK, read and sign this, if it's correct, sir. Colleague heard awhisper about an individual who was in Moorabbin on the night of the 15th. Colleague? Meaning fellow sex offenderor fellow murderer? I'm told this individual was driving a stolen dark blue Honda Civic. And he was pursued by yourcolleagues, if I have it right. [siren wailing] And does this individual have a name? Depends on what youwant to put on the table. I have a list of what I consider to be totally reasonable requests. [glass shattering] Fucking-- [bang] [shouting] Jesus! Don't move, don't move! [shouting] What the hell? Get down! I break and enter into cars for a living, yeah? It's how I earn a quid. That what you were doing inthe Silky Emperor car park? Working? I was cruising around thecar park looking for stock. Suddenly, I spot this VS Commodore with two blokes in it, cops. So I got out of there pretty quick. Commodore stuck with me for a bit, and then I lost him on Warrigal Road. Did you happen to comeback an hour later, then, for another look? No. I was at home, shitting myself! Plus, I heard all that shotsfired stuff on the scanner. Yeah, well, this is thetime to come clean, mate. Don't plead not guilty and then have us prove you're lying, becausejudges, they hate that shit! I'm not lying! Did you shoot Gary Silk and Rod Miller? No, it's not in my nature! Oh, "Blood will flow." Shooting cops sounds exactly your speed. No, that's bullshit! I'm a thief, man! We'll need blood and hair for DNA testing. Oh, and your earwax. Earwax? Hmm. Why? Well, your filthy ear preserves gunshot residue for months. This is gonna cost $20million by the time we're done. Do you reckon we'd go tothe same amount of trouble if they weren't cops? We're protecting theuniform, the thin blue line between order and chaos. Update on our Nazi car thief. He was home in bed when the shots were fired. He's got a neighbor withinsomnia and a telescope. Haven't you people got homes to go to? Wanna hear something weird? Nicole Debs just bought anotherrear window for her car. Another one? What happened was, Iinstalled the first one myself. I used silicon, yeah. "Great job, Ben", I thought. Except that the bastard blewout when Nicole was driving it. Isn't that right, kitten? Hey, what are you doing, having a sticky beak? Go back inside. Next time we got a professionalto install the little fucker. And don't forget, you still owe me, Dad. So did you manage to round up those phone records we asked for? Yeah, I'll just go and get 'em for you. Ta. Bang, bang. Shh. [chattering] Inspector, when do youexpect to make an arrest? I can't say. I don't have a crystal ball. Well, how long are you gonnakeep looking for these men? Months, years? As long as it takes. Paul, John Sylvester from the "Age". Do you think your taskforce is gonna be better resourced and better supported than Walsh Street was? I'm not here to discuss Walsh Street. Well, is that a yes or a no? We have everything we need. Thank you. Is that all we get? When I have something to say, I'll say it. Inspector! We're reporting here live from the steps at police headquarters. That was Paul Sheridan-- Paul, not only do we have to do this one better than Walsh Street, we have to be seen to do it better. Walsh Street was a mess because there was no clear chain of authority. Too many chiefs, too manyconflicting opinions. That's why I want you andyou alone talking to the media regularly. Even if I've got nothing to say? Paul, two coppers are dead. The public wants to knowwhat we're gonna do about it. So does the chief. So does the minister. So does the premier. Now, would it kill you to release the occasional harmless snippet of information? Graeme, if you want a PRcampaign, I'm not the man. [sighs] Put to Bandali Debs case to me. All right, Debs has aproven record of dishonesty. I point to his 1979 conviction for handling. Further to that, three years ago he pleaded guilty to stealingthat spare wheel from the car yard in Ferntree Gully. He received a bond and noconviction was recorded, but it's worth noting thathe led the police on a chase through three suburbs before he was caught. Now, his daughter Nicole owns a dark blue Hyundai Excel, which is an exactmatch for our missing vehicle. Coincidence? Who's to say that he isn't our bloke? Against. Skip, Ben Debs is a tradesman,who works for a living. He's-- he's got a wife. He's got five kids and a mortgage, and a dog named Pebbles. Is that the profile of a cop killer? He-- he pays his taxes. He pays his bills. He bought the Hyundai quitelegitimately for his daughter Nicole's 18th birthday. Is that the profile of-- of aguy that cold-bloodedly murders two cops just to avoid being questioned for-- for minor robbery matters? I mean, surely if he was ourguy, the first thing he'd do is dispose of the car, right? No match. Let's find out who's right. Put the dogs on him. [SINGING] Up there, Cazaly. In there and fight. Fly like an angel. You're-- Fucking christ! What happened, mate? Oh, god! Ah, your thumb? Oh! Let's have a look. Oh, fuck! Oh, it's all right. [laughter] OK, good on you, Darl. Here's your-- See you. [honking] A pretty thief maybe, butpublic enemy number one? Nah. I still want to see the car. You'd better not put onefucking scratch on it, mate. For the fucking umpteenthtime, I parked the car, I pulled out a bucket of blacklabel glue and some other stuff from the back.- Did you hear what I said? Not one scratch. Tools and shit. And I was in a hurry, I remember. And I slammed the hatch, bang. There was fucking glass everywhere. Well, where exactly? In the back. It all just went fucking-- fucking crashed down in the back. You know, bloody mess. And then I drove home, and then I gave Nicole the money to buy a new one. Yeah, he did. Which you fitted. Yeah, which blew out a few days later. Oh, and I remember something else. I know where those cops got shot. What do you mean? You know that chink restaurant, the-- um, the silky thingamajig? The Silky Emperor? Yeah. I did a job there a few years back. I tiled their bloody kitchen. The rear windscreen fragmentsfrom Nicole Debs' Excel don't match the samples from Cochranes Road. That means it's not her car. This is not the killer's Hyundai. What are you looking at me for? Find me a killer. SONG: Don't be coming around my neighborhood. [music playing] First time in here? No, of course not. She's gorgeous, eh? Yeah. That your sister, is she? Guess who was warming atable at Foodies that night. Foodies? Hmm. What's Foodies? The hamburger joint across theroad from the Korean barbecue. Nik the Russian Radev and a mateof his they call Greaseball. Radev? I thought Radev was in stir. No, paroled three weeks earlier. My informant's grandson ismixed up in his amphet business. He says Radev was there to make a deal. Hi. Hi. Two black coffees with milk, thanks. Yeah. Fucking jack. Look at him. Narc? How the fuck would I know? Shall I ask him? Narc? Uh, yeah. So what time You knock off? CASHIER: Sorry? What time do you finish? Um, why are you asking? Well, some mean and nastyhombres around these parts. Oh, yeah. It's OK. I'm a big girl. - Good to know. - There you go. Thank you. That's OK. All right. Nice to meet you. You, too. Word is, two hours later,Radev hunted Rod and Gary down. They drove into the carpark of the Silky Emperor just to lure them out? Why kill two police just because they interrupt a drug deal? Well, maybe there was more to it. Well, did Gary ever bust him? I'm not sure, but two weeks later, there was an aggravated burgon a house in Northcote. Do you remember it? Three offenders in balaclavas. It was a shakedown. One of them shoved a gunin a five year old's mouth. That's right. Special response are looking at Radev. So the reckless act of a manwho's already killed two cops. His weapon of choice? A bulldog 38, the right caliber. OK, so car pulls up hereunder this broken streetlight, deliberately. The driver waits in the vehicle till the cop car pulls up behind them,and Gary and Rod get out. Rod stays at the back of the car. Gary comes to the frontto speak with the driver. Gary then crosses to the front of the car. Passenger steps out. Rod pulls out his firearm, takeshots at the passenger fleeing. Driver then jumps intothe car, grabs his pistol. [gunshot] Why? Well, maybe Gary didn't realize what he'd stumbled across. And maybe Radev assumed that he did. So you bring them in, apply the blowtorch to their hairy bellies. Just Radev. Divide and conquer. MAN: Police, don't move! Police, police! Don't move! [shouting] Piss off. G'day, mate. I told you, I lost my gun. After you killed two police officers. What for I kill policemen for? You tell us, Radev. I tell you, go have good fuck with yourself! What happened at Foodies, hmm? You saw Sergeant Silk. What happened? Did you enjoy puttinga gun in a child's mouth? I know nothing about this thing. Your mate Greaseball said you did. OK. I tell you who killed police. Mm-hmm. And you forget about this thing. We have deal. No, I don't do deals. Read that for me, aloud. "Tell them Luchi--" "Lucifer". "Lucifer". "Tell them Lucifer was here." You tell me the truth. While it counts. [chuckling] Greaseball. What? Come on, fuck. You know this fat fuck Greaseball. Fat fuck. Leave me alone! What do you want? You have the wrong man! I tell you, you have the wrong man! You don't want to talkto us, Mr. Greaseball, huh? Nikolai Radev lies! Right. Because Nikolai Radevknows who the real killer is. Oh, yeah? Surprise us. Nikolai Radev. Oh, OK. Yeah. Well, they're both bloody compulsive liars, and they hate each other's guts. So you can't trust a word they say. But you know, I mean, we can't rule them out. What's their motivation? Hatred. Killing a cop, you know you're gonna bring down the biggest shower ofshit of all time on your head. You think these idiots stoppedto consider the consequences? Not the right guys, then, eh? Go back to your desk. You've got your own work to do, yes? Well, how have you been keeping? Oh, OK, considering. Jimmy's not sleeping doesn't help. Guess all you can do is justtake it one day at a time. Mm-hmm. It's a cliche, I know. How's progress your end? It's a little slower than we'd like, but I'm hoping Santa might bringus something special, though. I'm sorry. I can't say any more. Well, merry Christmas anyway. You've got to have faith atthis time of year, don't you? Yes. [baby crying] Hello, hello. He could grow up to be anything, couldn't he? Prime minister, Nobel Prizewinner, captain of Carlton. Carlton? He'd have Roddy spinning in his grave. He won't even remember him. You can tell him his father was respected by every singlemember of Victoria Police. I was working, um,hospital not far from here. I worked as a nurse, andI'd just finished my shift. Who does she belong to? Radev, regular customer. She says that she saw him at 12:15 that night to buy some pills. Personally use only. 12:15. Where? Service station in Warrigal Road. Says that she had to go thelong way around because there were too many cops in the area. So immediately aftercommitting a double murder, police swarming all around the place, he takes time out to do a $100 drug deal? Um, yeah. Out you go, mate. Imagine this. Imagine a plank of wood thiswide lying on the ground. What if I asked you to walk the length of it without stepping off or touching the ground? Could you do it? Course you can. Every single time. But what happens if wesuspend that plank of wood 100 feet in the air andwe ask you to do it again? You can't do it, can you? You can't do it becauseyou're scared of falling. Fear of failure is the rust that corrodes commitment and endeavor. Once a team believes it'sgonna lose, it does lose. Do you understand? Yes. Yes! You want me to tell youhow to catch these crooks? Yeah. You want me to tell you? The thing is, they're not. Sorry? Crooks. Professional crooks. You already know the answer. You were taught the answer at the academy. They're doing it for fun. Those robberies last year,and they netted what? 30 odd grand. Just over. And it's working for your teammates. Lucifer's in it for the kicks. That's how you win. Where you going? Wherever you're going. Jump in. We'll talk about it. [moaning in pain] [chuckling] [sobbing] [gunshot] In memory of Sergeant Gary Michael Silk, register number 24685, andSenior Constable Rodney James Miller, register number 29276,tragically shot and killed in the performance of their duty at Moorabbin on the 16th day of August, 1998. We're going to start again,go back to the beginning, look at the crime sceneagain, the victims again, the robberies, the killer's cars. And forget everything you think you know. Look at it as a clean sheet. Shiiiit. Too hard for you? No, it's just-- Leave now. Go. Well, I was just joking-- I told you I wanted stayers. Yeah, but-- I'm serious. Go, now. Good luck with the rest of your career. Today is day one. Captain Bligh. Captain Bligh! I feel old. You look old, old and beaten down. And sick. Get fucked. You and the horse that you rode in on. And the horse you rode in on! How exactly do we start again? Do we go back to last year, pullout robbery number one again? Last year? Robbery number one's sevenbloody years ago, junior. First time Lucifer went around. How many robberies in that first lot, 28? Yeah. So what are we gonna do,drag every last bastard out again and look at all the witness statements? Ugh. There'll be millions. Remember that one where that bloke chucked a tinnie at that robber's car? arsehole! Palm Beach restaurant, Patterson Lakes, October something, 1994. The famous Mark Butterworthphotographic memory. Waste of a perfectly good tinnie. SONG: Well, I'm putting it out,out there for the world to see. arsehole, get back here! SONG: I need a brand new manto give good loving to me. Don't want somebody to hold my hand. I want someone to understand-- 86, 86. Backs onto 92. And ended up on the-- [inaudible] We end up there. What are we-- [gunshot] There was something funnyabout that getaway car. Remember, Mark? Yeah, it belonged to a gorilla. A gorilla? Hmm. Jason Manuel Ghiller. 18 years old, tire-fitter. Saturday, October 8, 1994. Mm-hmm. Jason Manuel Ghiller driveshis 4-door Laser it to the new hotel in Dandenong for a few drinks and bumps into an old mate. An hour later, he offers the mate and his girlfriend a lift home. Goes outside, car's gone. Stolen, he claims to police later. Yup. Definitely suss. That sounds OK to me. But you're young, and trusting, and naive. And you're wearing a fucking homicide tie. You're an Armed Robber, son. You don't wear puffy homicide ties! Hey, when he was interviewed,the general impression was that Ghiller, the gorilla, only pretended to be shocked when told the car was used in a robbery. B, he bought another caralmost immediately with cash, doesn't even bother to wait andsee if the old one's recovered. C, he matches the descriptionof the second Palm Beach robber. And that's when the firstseries of robberies stopped? Yup, for whatever reason. How old was he? 17? I mean, maybe he just gotshit scared and bailed out. [chuckling] From the mouths of babes. Didn't know you boys could read. Hey, that top number. I recognize it. Whose is it? Dunno. That kid Ghiller's most frequently dialed. We think Debs and Ghillerwere the original robbers. And Ghiller got a scare, lost his nerve. And last year, he found himself a new partner. Debs is Lucifer. Why doesn't his car matchthe glass on Cochranes Road? Is it possible you made a mistake? These are highly sophisticatedscientific instruments. It is not guesswork. How many pieces of glass did you recover from the Debs' Hyundai? I was on leave. 53. How many did we actually test? Theoretically, it's onlynecessary to test a few. How many? Three. How about we go backand retest all 53, Edward? A second round of window testsindicate that the Debs' Hyundai cannot be ruled out after all. According to the refractive index, half the fragments are consistent with gunshot damage, which puts BandaliDebs back into the frame. And for that we can thank the Armed Robbers. Thanks, boys. [applause] Hey, bags I'm there for the arrest. I said we can't exclude Debs. We are light years away from arresting him. Our task now is to prove whetheror not he is our Lucifer. Graeme. OK, I'm gonna ask you toswear an oath of silence. No one's to know that we're looking for Debs. I mean, no one. Once the warrants are through,we're gonna off his phone and install LDs in his house, his cars, his kids' cars, his garage, and three foot up his arse, if he looksthe other way long enough. The idea is to catch him bragging about the night that he took out two cops. Let's get to work. All right, come on. Let's go. That's a nice dress. God, every bloody time. Come on! Yes. You, young lad, you're coming with me. Where's the other one? the-- go. Oh, come on! All right, leave it. For god's sake. Hurry up. Oh, come on. Yeah, I'll just follow you. Just follow her. Bye. [MUSIC - I MONSTER, "LUST FOR A VAMPYR"] SONG: I've been workingthe whole day long, getting older while you stay young. Give me shelter. The night is dark. Live forever. When you meet anyone youcan find, sink your teeth, you're in love for one night. As you sleep in the day you are mine. I just want your love, so don't waste my time. Did your father say whattime he was gonna be home? What do I look like, hisfucking social secretary? Jeez, you've got a mouth on you. And you didn't get it from me. RITA [ON PHONE]: Hello. Hi, Reet. It's me. How you doing? RITA [ON PHONE]: Don't ask Dot. My chilblains are playing up again. DOROTHY [ON PHONE]: Oh, no. Again? Listen to this, listen to this. Can you-- can you play that back? Have a listen to this. All right? DOROTHY [ON TAPE]: Jeez, you got a mouth on you, and you didn't get it from me.RITA [ON TAPE]: Hello. DOROTHY [ON TAPE]: Hi, Reet. It's me. How you doing? RITA [ON TAPE]: Don't ask, Dot. My chilblains are playing up again. Oh, no. Again? RITA [ON PHONE]: Oh, can'thardly blood walk today. Now, this is-- this is Dorothy Debs on the phone to Rita Ghiller. It's Jason Ghiller's mum, OK? DOROTHY [ON TAPE]: Do you knowwhat Mama used to do with hers? RITA [ON TAPE]: Yeah, I've triedrubbing them with raw onion. Um, "Mama"? They're sisters, sisters-in-law? No, they're-- they're sisters, apparently. This means if Debs is Lucifer,then his first partner was his own bloody nephew. And he replaced him withhis daughter's boyfriend. BANDALI: Keep your handsoff up, you cockhead moron. Can we watch something else, please? Hey, Ben. You know them townhouses where I'm working? Ben. What? The townhouses I'm working on. What? Oh, them ones over in Warrandyte? What about 'em? It's not Warrandyte, you fuckhead. It's Wantirna. God help us. It's fucking open house. No security. All you gotta do is cut the fence and walk in, walk out with your arms full. Fucking beautiful, Ben. Very interesting. MAN [ON TV]: Squeeze those pimples you could end up with scars. WOMAN [ON TV]: Our Logiewinner, AFI winner, you name it, my next guest has done everything. WOMAN [ON TV]: When it's inthis magazine and doing that, it's never me! MAN [ON TV]: Got a headache? [laughter] WOMAN [ON TV]: Why? Because I don't want to. MAN [ON TV]: Oh, come on. WOMAN [ON TV]: You're so annoying. WOMAN [ON TV]: --live videotapethat was in Melbourne. While in Brisbane, she starrted in the world premiere of the play-- So how's that new job going, mate? OK. I like Hungry Jacks. Burgers are better than atMacca's, don't you reckon? Yeah. Hey, do you know where theykeep the safe in that joint? Yeah. Well, maybe I'll knock it over. What do you reckon? Have they got cameras? You know, CCTV? Yeah. Well, it won't matter if we wear masks. I-- I reckon clown masks would be the way to go. What do you reckon? Or how about Ronald McDonald? "Hey, kiss the floor, kids." Give-- give 'em nightmares for life. Give it to the manager, big time. What, you don't like him? No, he's an arsehole. Well, maybe I could singlehim out for special attention. What do you reckon? Cut off his finger. Would you like me to do that? Yeah. I'm worried about that boy. Gotta put a rocket up his arseto get a civil word out of him. It's a phase. All teenagers go through it. Girls never did. Yeah, well, that's because they're too busy sucking up to their daddy. Guess what? I've got a fat. Too bad. I said-- I'm not in the mood. Where are you going? Gippsland. Gippsland? What-- what a coincidence. I'm going there, too. - Yeah? Get in. Thanks. There you go. Right. Gippsland, Gippsland. We're both off to Gippsland. You don't often see girlshitchhiking on their own. You got a boyfriend? Ja. Yes. Ja, ja. Yeah, I bet you do. Bet-- I'll bet they are all over you like flies. I'm-- I'm John. Sabrina. Hello, Sabrina. It's a pretty name for a pretty girl. I like European girls. Very honest with your needs. I'm very honest with my needs, too. Shit. [honking] Hey, hey, hey! Hey, fuck! Hey! Help! BANDALI [ON TAPE]: And once I-- I walked in and I said, "Getdown on the fucking floor." And they all just fell down like spaghetti. [laughter] Get down on the ground! You know how when you'repicking up spaghetti, and it just-- [laughter] It just drops. But it's no good when you laugh. Yeah. No, no serious. Because you know why? they get confident. Yeah, yeah. BANDALI [ON TAPE]: Hey, remember that sheila playing around on themchairs, laughing her head off? No. No, that wasn't me that time, Ben. It wasn't you? No. Oh, yeah. She, uh-- she thought I was joking, and she wouldn't lie down. I should have put the rod in her mouth and blown her fucking brains out. There's no noise. Swear to God You just stick it in and click. All there is, is just skinsplattered everywhere. Fuck. July '94, Casey's restaurant, Berwick. One of the victims, a woman,thought it was a joke, and she refused to lie down on the floor. This is Debs and Nicole'sboyfriend, Jason Roberts, talking yesterday. Well, we nailed him. The problem is, Mark,that this isn't actual proof that he killed Silk and Miller. The car, this, the Jason Ghiller link? Are you seriously suggestingwe have got the wrong man? I need him to spell it out explicitly. Unambiguously. Otherwise, we may as well justcall this Walsh Street mark II. Hey, Merry Christmas. [sighs] Who taught you basic right and wrong, Graeme? Your parents? I suppose so, yeah. I mean, the family unit, that'swhere it all begins, isn't it? But you can't blame your parents for everything. Listen, Paul, why don't youtake a few days off, eh? Spend some time with your own. That has to be the way to get to him. Through his family. [siren wails] Cops. What? What did we do? Just relax. What did we do? It's probably just afucking RBT or something. What did I do? We're interested in your vehicle. You the registered owner of the vehicle? I am. Can I see your license, please? Pop the hatch for us, please. Why? Fucking bullshit. What you fucking looking for? Mate, a vehicle just like this one was used in a very serious crime. Don't look at me. I'm a nurse. Right. I'm a respectable member ofthe community, for fuck's sake! Good night! Mrs. Sutherland? We'd like to talk to your son. Which one? Robert. HELGA [ON PHONE]: They saidthey wanted to talk to Robert because somebody told them that he would know who killed two policemen. BANDALI: They said that? Then they asked me if Iknow anybody owns a Hyundai. Hey, I-- I don't know cars. Then they asked if I had more children, and I said I have one boy in Melbourne. That's all I could tell them. We are not criminals. Mum, Mum, just don't worry, all right? Just-- just-- just don't worry. It's nothing. All right? Look, I'll talk to you later. [beep] You worried? No, I'm not worried. Not worried about a thing. I just wonder why they wanna talk to Robert. I'm not worried, because I know he's on drugs. Yeah, besides, nobody's seen nothing. BANDALI [ON TAPE]: Nobody's seen a thing. [imitates gunshots] One in the head. This is close to an admission. Tell that to a jury. I want someone to leak a story. "We're moving the searchfor the Hyundai interstate, because we've drawn a blank here in Victoria." But one that take the pressure off them, skip? Exactly. Hopefully they'll relax andtell us something we can use. What about [imitates gunshots]one in the head? Which means what? Shooting Gary Silk in the head. Obviously, that's what it means. Any decent barrister wouldtear that statement to shreds. "Detective Beanland, how dowe know that Mr. Debs isn't referring to a boxing match?" Now, listen to me, all of you. Whenever you think you've gotenough, remember Walsh Street. We'll only get one chance. So think like a defense lawyer. You're the leaker. Fucking idiots. [laughter] You're in the clear, Dad. You don't understand howthey solve cases, Joanne. Sometimes it's after 18months, two years, three years when they go and search places. Yeah, but what are they gonna find? Fuck all. Them things disappeared, you know, what we used. Could they be found? No. One's cut up. The other's in the fucking lake. Well, they're talking about guns, the disposal of a murder weapon. Which lake? Cardinia? Oh, shit. That's huge. Skip, skip! You gotta hear this. BANDALI [ON TAPE]: Joanne, I don't wanna worry you or anything,but I'm telling you straight. In the next six months, we're gonna have to get rid of another two CPs. And you know why? To make the investigation go stupid. CPs? That's his word for "cops". The daughters know all about it. JOANNE [ON TAPE]: Don't you think they would have been fucking pulling us into the police station by now? All I'm saying is that if thiscontinues, this matter, two CPs have gotta go. JOANNE [ON TAPE]: Where? I mean, it'd have to befar, across the other side of the city. BANDALI [ON TAPE]: Yeah, I'm not gonna use e-TAG or anything like that. Thanks. Yeah. I mean, killing more policeputs a new complexion on it. It might be just words. There's no law against talking. Thank you. There's more, sir. JOANNE [ON TAPE]: No, seriously, I don't reckon there's gonna be any--BANDALI [ON TAPE]: Shut up. Dorothy. What are you doing? I'm just talking to bubs. Can't we just sit here and talk? Oh, right. So you talk to your daughter and tell her what's fucking going on,but you won't talk to your wife. Just talking about fucking shit! DOROTHY [ON TAPE]: Well, your tea's ready. Seriously, do you think I should get rid of the little kid and the mother? You know, the cop's wife? Make 'em start thinking it's about, you know, drugs orsomething else, you know? Something personal about him? Give me one good reason whywe don't arrest them today. I don't have enough proof. But this strategy ifyours, stirring the possums-- Could get more cops killed. I vote we take them down now. It's very high risk. How can you guarantee theywon't do what they say? And it's not just members'lives we're talking about. It's a risk we have to manage, which is why I've asked Donald to join us. I need more time. We move on them now,they'll walk at committal. Can you manage it? Put a SOG unit on standby down the road. And the moment they look like they're tooling up, we shut 'em down. I want to see them in the Supreme Court, not the Coroners Court. Well, you do your job, and I'll do mine. Upgrade your surveillance, Paul. I want to know where they areevery minute of every day. Forget budget. It's not true you're lookingfor the car interstate? No, it's not. By the way, Paul, it's Valentine's Day, in case you hadn't noticed. Not too late to send the wife some flowers. Carmel, where does Jimmy go to creche? Why? There's been a threat made against you. And him. By these men? These murderers? What threat? To kill you. Are we safe? Yes. Crime Stoppers has received a call from an anonymous person who believes he can identify one of the offenders. We believe this person has a substantial degree of credibility, and I wouldurge him to call us again. No one was there but us, cockhead. PAUL [ON TV]: This is the most significant lead we've had in 20 months. Once again, I would urgethis caller to come forward. I will personallyguarantee your anonymity. Your help in this matter could be crucial in solving this crime. Thank you. [chattering] That's good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Good. Why don't we justarrest him, bring him in? He's a kid. He'll give up Debs in five seconds flat. And you're prepared togamble the entire investigation on that, are you? That's me! Every bastard who picks up thispaper's gonna think it's me! I don't wanna think about thisevery day of my fucking life! What? You don't come in here! Your mother's on the phone. The cops have been bothering her again. Ooh, there's a big dinosaur, buddy, hey. Can you see him? A big t-rex, huh? [babbling] Yeah, that's right. [babbling] Carmel, hi. I'm a police officer. It's fine. There's no danger. Police? But how? How? We've been shadowingyou since Valentine's Day. That's our job. I had no idea. Thank you. I didn't know, Rod, but everyone says he was a top bloke. Thank you. We're gonna have to be reallycareful now with what we do. We're gonna have to watchevery word, stop talking shit, you know. Yeah. Act like everyday wankers. Yeah. Maybe I ought to go in and see 'em. Own up it looks like me. Yeah. 'Cause if it was you, youwouldn't be stupid enough to do that, would you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, act like a cockhead. Yeah, no worries. Seize the initiative. Oh, very interesting situation, Jason. Yeah. That's my picture, mate. I mean, it looks exactly like me. It's pretty close, isn't it? Oh, when I saw this, I nearlyhad a fucking heart attack. Me mum went mental. I can believe it. But it's not you? Mate-- mate, I'm a chippie. Well, an apprentice. I'm no killer. We're gonna have to checkyou out, you realize that? Yeah, yeah. No problem, mate. Cocky little turd. Come arrest day, we'll release him immediately. Give him some time on hisown without his mate Lucifer telling him what to think. He might just spilled his guts to Nicole. And we'll be recording every word. One of them had to shoot first. Who's to say it wasn't Jason? But why did they have to shoot at all? Maybe that was the plan. "If ever we get pulled over, we shoot first." Jason, can you please stateyour full name for the tape? Jason Joseph Roberts. MAN [ON TAPE]: I'm justgonna ask you few questions in relation to the deaths of-- Oh, what a bunch of fucking cockheads. No fucking idea. JASON [ON TAPE]: Yeah, that's why I'm here. You know what I done? What? When he went out of the room,I put his cup where my cup was. What, they tried to take your prints? I don't know. So I swapped the cups around anyway. [chuckling] Oi, it's that time again, Ben. What? Time for a job. What job? Bang, bang? I'd love to, mate, but we are red hot. So? So we go west or something. Wear a mask, hit someching-chong joint or some-- Mate, the Ds are all over us. I kill Ds. I know you do. I know you do. JASON [ON TAPE]: I kill Ds. "I killed Ds." Go again. JASON [ON TAPE]: I kill Ds. "I killed Ds." "I kill detectives." Even if we could enhance the audio, how do we prove he means detectives? "D" could mean "dickhead". "Dickhead"? Do you reckon? OK, fine. I'm going home. You wanna sack me, sack me. BANDALI: Hello. How you going? Yeah, good. You? You caught those people who did that thing? Uh, no. No, not yet, but pretty positivewe'll find them in the end. What about the car? You found the car yet? No, not yet. But we're still looking. What, you live around here, do you? No, I-- just on the wayto a mate's place, actually. I just stopped by to pick up some stuff. - Oh, yeah? - What about you? You keeping busy. What do you do again? Oh, I'm flat-out. You know, tiling, roofing, plastering. I'm doing a job over inMooroolbark at the moment, at KFC there. Right. Actually, I wanted to havea word again with you soon. Oh, yeah? Yeah. About that young blokelives with your daughter. Is it Jason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, see, a few issueshave been raised about him. We've had a few calls aboutthat photofit that got released. Uh-huh. I'll call you, yeah? - Yeah. - All right. Sure. I'll see you around. Yeah. I'm gonna find out where he lives. That stuff about himvisiting a friend's bullshit. Oi, you reckon our phones are bugged? I reckon my mobile is. Why do you think that? The other day, someone callsand goes, "hello, hello?" And they go, "oh, got the wrong number." Listen, any stuff you thinkshould go from this place, you get rid of it now. You know what I mean? It's all good stuff. If he was visiting a friend, he wouldn't have been in his jogging gear, all sweaty and stuff. I don't care what anyone fucking thinks. I'm gonna find out where he lives, and then I'm gonna fix him up. BANDALI [ON TAPE]: I don't carewhat anyone fucking thinks. I'm gonna find out where he lives, and then I'm gonna fix him up. [sighs] We cannot stand by while this man threatens the lives of police. We need hard evidence. It's your call. It's always been your call. Let's pray we find some. call SOG. Bring them in. What have you got on today? Quoting on a factory job in Clayton. Big bucks. Don't be late home. 5:00 in the morning, andshe's whingeing already. G'day, Ben. Hi, Colin. G'day, Colin. How are you?
