I was very low. Things went a bit topsy-turvy in my life, and... I put my hand out, I struggled. But, you know, I thought to myself, "Come on, Brian. Time to give yourself a kick up the bottom." "Get busy." I just started making stuff. Inventions, I guess. Any little idea I had, I just made. You know, stuff I build isn't for everyone, but that's all right by me. Be nice to have an extra pair of hands around here sometimes to help out now and again, but... You know, bounce ideas off and play darts, et cetera. But you can't have everything, can you? That's just greedy. This is my home. Ploxgreen Cottage. The front door. The next door. There we have it. A kitchen. That's a cabbage bin. I have a bin specifically for them, 'cause I eat a lot of cabbages. This is my infamous inventions pantry. It's actually a cowshed. Pine cone bag. It's basically just a plain bag with pine cones glued onto it. Ping-pong, picky-pong, ping-pong pie. This is basically a puzzle I came up with and tried to sell to Selfridges. A knife. Eggs. Green rope. It's literally just a belt that you can put eggs in. It's an egg belt. Anyone want any butter? So, turn it on, and it'll suck the air out the helmet. Tea. Is this interesting? I sit here most nights after a busy day down the village or in the barn, working in the barn, and I have my dinner... here. So, this is my new project. It's a cuckoo clock. It's not your traditional idea of a cuckoo clock. I thought I'd do something a bit different. It's a flying cuckoo clock. So, whenever anyone in the village wants to know the time, they can look up in the air, and I'll be there... flying around on it. What time is it? "There's Brian. Half 2:00. There or thereabouts." Never flown anything before, so I'm a little bit nervous about taking this little beauty up into the blue, blue sky. You don't try things, you don't succeed, do you? You just got to keep trying. Right, the plan is, I'm gonna head off down the lane, and by the time I reach the end, I should be hitting 90 miles an hour, and then I take off into the blue sky and I head to Dummock's Hill. I'm gonna have a spot to eat, come back and have some tea. 6:00 p.m., I should imagine. Wish me luck. Come on. Get back! Get back! It's on fire! It's on fire! Get back! It's on fire! Get back! Can you not hear me? They don't always work, but I tend to learn from each thing that I build. And I've got so much going on up here-- ideas and whatnot-- that it doesn't actually bother me. On to the next one. Lid's off one of these, June. - Oh, crikey. - Yeah. -Do you want to bring it here, then? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Go stale, won't they? -Yes, they will. You can have it, actually, if you like. -No. No, no, no. -Yes, definitely. -All right. -Go on, have it. -Thank you. -If you don't mind. Well, a pot of Choccy Dunk Dunks - and a NanaPop. - Okay. That'll be one pound exactly, then, please. -What, for both of them? -Yep. Oh. Well, I'm not charging you for this one. Don't worry if you haven't got any money. -You can come anytime. -I've definitely got... -I've definitely got money. -Have you? -Yeah. -That's all right. You don't have to pay me, Brian. -Come... -Gotcha. -Ah. Okay. -Thanks, June. -Lovely. Thank you very much. -Oh. -I'll put that in my pocket. -Yeah. -Careful it doesn't all fall out. -Yeah. See you, June. -Brian? -Yeah? You've got something caught on your feet. Oh, no, they're meant to be there. - Oh. - Yeah, I made 'em. They're trawler nets for shoes. Oh. -Oh. -Bye. -Bye, now. -Bye-bye. Bye. ♪ People dancin'... ♪ Fly-tippers. These things are like a treasure trove to me. This is fun. That's not bad. I could have some fun with that. I was once looking for metal in one of these piles, and, uh, I found a metal detector. Hello. I'm building a robot. I don't know why I didn't think of it before. Be very, very, very handy. Strong. Fast. Agile. Can help me lift things around the house. I just take inspiration from stuff around me. You know, anything, absolutely anything. That could be his ankle. Hand. I just look around me, and I go, "What can I use? What can I use?" Belly button. I've always wanted to build one. It's always been a scratch I've wanted to itch. Scratch, scratch, scratch, like Mr. Williams over there. I mean, who wouldn't want to build one, eh? Who wouldn't want to build one? Huh? What do they call it? Artifici... artif... What is it? Artificial intelligence. That's it. Artificial intelligence. - That's it. - A.I. -Huh? -A.I. -"Eh-ah"? What? -A.I. "Eh-ah"? A.I.! -Artificial intelligence. -Yeah. Yeah, I know. Doesn't look too bad, does he? Not quite what I had in mind, but... I've learned building a robot is much like making a cake. You start off wanting a Victoria sponge. It comes out like a blancmange. That's fine, 'cause I love blancmanges. I wonder what he'll do when I turn him on. Huh. Da-da! I've never done that before. Well, his spleen's working. Come on, then. Activate. Activate. Please. Come on. Please, please, please. Activate. Gave it a good go, didn't I? Unfortunately, didn't work out. That's life, innit? Huh? One door closes, another door opens. That's what I always say. And then that door closes and another door opens. And then that door closes and another door opens. And that-that door will probably close at some point, another one will hopefully open, and then I imagine, at some point along the line, then that door will close, and hopefully, fingers crossed, another... Basically, what I'm trying to say is doors open and close, and there's no getting away from it. Come on, Brian. Double 13. Here we go. Ah, fiddlesticks. -Hi, Brian. -Hi, Hazel. What are you up to? Shopping. I'm just going to the chemist to get some stuff for my mum. Oh. Yeah. And then I'm gonna put some rubbish on the bonfire. Oh. Something to do. Yeah. Think it's gonna be a big one this year. Yeah, it'll be a big bonfire, yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Okay. -Okay. I've got to go 'cause I'm really late. Oh, okay. Uh, nice to see you. -Nice to see you, too. -Bye. -All the best. -Bye-bye.

You want that name, do you? Charles Petrescu? All right, then. I am Charles Petrescu. Hello, Brian. Hello, Charles. It's... lovely to meet you. Wow. I am your friend. I'm your friend, too. My heart's going like the clappers. I have gray hair and round spectacles. There are seven buttons on my shirt. I think what happened was there were two wires in Charles's head that hadn't connected properly. So, when I flicked the switch, they hadn't connected properly. And what I think happened while I was out-- Mr. Williams, the mouse, came along, walked along one of the wires, and the weight of Mr. Williams seesawed the wire onto the other wire, and they connected. Fired it into life, like a jump start. Am I making sense? Come on, then, you. Watch my mother's Turkish saucer. - Staircase. - Out we go. - Bannister. - Take your time. Don't rush. - Aah! - Walls. There's a good boy. That's it. Oh, look at you. -Now, Charles, this room... -Kitchen. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. -Basically, this is where... -Is where you cook. Yes. Yeah. Right. Right, what I'll do is -I'll put the, uh... -Put the kettle on? He's ahead of the game here, isn't he? Huh? This is marvelous. Huh? You're a clever boy. Look at that. Yeah? Cabbages. You know what they are, don't you? A vegetable crop with dense leaved heads. Cabbage weights will generally range from 500 to 1,000 grams. The most common are smooth-leaved, firm-headed green cabbages, while smooth-leaved purple cabbages and crinkle-leaved savoy cabbages are considerably rarer. The heaviest cabbage ever found was 62.71 kilograms. Under conditions of long, sunny days, such as those found... I never thought I'd make anything as amazing as Charles. Uh, it's absolutely blown my mind, to be honest with you. -You built my body. -I built his body. I built his body. It took 72 hours. And my tummy is a washing machine. And his tummy's a washing machine. That's it. Your tummy's a washing machine. -Took me 72 hours. -My name is Charles Petrescu. Charles Petrescu. That's your name, isn't it? That's your name. I thought, 24 hours ago, I was gonna have to crush you up and scrap you. Did you know that? -My name is Charles Petrescu. -Yeah. Already said that. Yeah. -And you built my body. -And I built your body. That's it. That's it. That's it. Anything else you want to say? No. -Yes. -Yes. Come on, then. Hold my hand. Hold my hand. Come on. Through here. Everything is lovely. You say that. It's not all lovely. It's a dangerous world sometimes. Dangerous: able or likely to cause harm or injury. Perilous. Perilous. That's a good word. Perilous. -Can we go swimming, Brian? -No, no, no, no. One thing at a time. One thing at a time. Okay? Does it all stop at the tree? Beg your pardon? How far does the outside go? "How far does the outside go?" What are you on about? Does the outside stop at the tree? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it goes way beyond the tree. Way beyond the tree. There's a big old world out there that you don't know about. A big, perilous world. Oh, my gosh. -It's all right. It's okay. -What was that? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. -Perilous. So very perilous. -Just birds. Just birds. Just crows. Huh? All right. Where are they going, Brian? Don't know. Probably getting some worms or something. Can birds do what they like? Can birds do what they like? I don't know. Yeah, I imagine so. Yeah. Right. -Let's get you indoors. -No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Come on. -Let's get you indoors. -No. Come on. I'll boil you some cabbages. -Ooh, cabbages. -Yeah, cabbages. Yes, please. Yes, please! No. It's best if no one sees him. Keep him here. Simpler that way. If I took him into town, you know, Christ knows what would happen. People would be queuing round the block to have a chat with him. And there's lots of rough people there, so... There's one family in particular, the Tommingtons. They're a handful. Bloody hard work. Come on! Eddie in particular. Bloody nightmare. He's known for stealing stuff. He took my red one of these. If he ever heard about Charles... So it's probably easier if I just keep Charles here. Otherwise... Eddie. What the cock's that? Down here. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. -I'm not so sure about this. Hey, hey. Let's have a look at your eyebrows. I'm a little apprehensive. All right. Okay. Uh... bit tufty. -Tufty? -Tufty-wufty eyebrows. -Tufty-wufty. -Ah. We'll get them trimmed up. Now, relax. Only scissors. -Danger, danger. -Only scissors. There we go. Ouchy-wouchy. -There's a good boy. -Eek. Now, I normally sleep for about four to five hours, okay? But you might hear me walking around on the landing, but that's just me going to the toilet, okay? -Wee-wees. -Wee-wees. That's it. That's it. Right, then. Good night, Charles. -Good night. -Good night, Brian. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams, yourself. Good night. Wishing you the best of nights. Good night. Charles, can you turn your blue eye light off, please? -Charles? -Yes. Can you turn your blue eye light off, please? I can't turn it off. Thank you. Really? I can't turn my blue eye light off. Oh. Okay. I am sleeping. I am sleeping. I am sleeping. Draw, draw, draw. I like to draw. Right, I'm just heading into the village for a bit, okay? -Can I come, please? -No, not this time. You stay here, all right? I want to go out, please. No, you can't, okay? Could I just have a little walk around the garden? Charles, no. Can you hear me? No. Okay, cool, but I just left something in the garden, so I may just go and get that from the garden. You're being cheeky. I know the games you're playing. And it's a no. Okay? I won't be long. All right? There she is. There's Winnie. You all right? Yeah, I'm waiting for you to open the door. Stand by the door. She wants me to wait... go into the door and... It's no good standing there. -Go by the door. -Huh? What are you saying? It's no good standing by there. Yeah, I'm waiting for you to... She's waiting... I'm gonna open... I'll knock on the door. It won't take long, will it? Ah. In and out like a ferret. I don't want these lights burning all night. Come on, Chewy. Eat your nuts. Come on. - Hi, Hazel. - Good bo... Oh, hello, Brian. Just feeding Chewy. He doesn't want to hear about that, Hazel. He's got a job to do. Yeah, I'll-I'll just get on with it, then. Good boy. Right. They live to 101. -Do they? -Yeah. I'll be happy to reach my 60s. What's that? What, that? It's a... plunger refreshment bottle. Basically, you flip it and you sip it. It's peach and pear cordial. Oh, he likes it. -Do you want some? -No, thanks. No. Hello. Who's there? Chewy. - Whatever. - "Whatever." Who's that? - Who's a sexy boy, then? - Right, that's enough. Go and tidy the shoes on the shoe mat, please, Hazel. Thank you. Oh, there's an onion in here. Right, that's me, then. Bye, Brian. Bye, Hazel. Goodbye, Brian. See you, mate. I'm home! - Brian.

You live with me in the cottage. -But I want to go. -Honestly. Why won't you let me go, Brian? I want to dance on the beach. It's miles away. I know. That's why I want to go. You'd miss me, wouldn't you? What is going on up there? He said to me last night he wanted to get a taxi to town, hang out by the shops. It's like he's changed overnight. I can't just let him go off on his own, can I? Cold night tonight, innit? Charles? Wakey-wakey. Charles? Oi. Wake up. Wake up. Huh? Come on. What do you want now? Don't talk to me like that. I just wondered if you wanted to go into the village. Who with? With me. You said I wasn't allowed, Brian. Yeah, well, I've changed my mind just this once. I'll walk in and meet you there. You will not walk in and meet me there. You'll come with me in the truck, or you won't go at all. -Whatever. -Don't say "whatever." What... ...ever. What you doing? Why are you wearing that? I feel pretty cool. Not in my old curtains, you don't. Put something else on. Hoopla! Spoilsport. How's he done that? Okay. Come on, then. Are we going to the shops, Brian? Yes, we are going to the shops. Now, do as you're told, okay? There are some things that I need. Things you need? I'd like a map of the world for my wall. Right, okay. Well, maybe not today, 'cause I've got stuff to do, but... And some soap. -Soap? -And some cotton socks. Cotton socks? And I want to sit in the front, Brian. No, you're not sitting in the front. You're sitting in the back. You're not old enough. I want to go in the front, Brian. You're not old enough to go in the front. I want you in the back. -Front. -Not front. I will sit in the front, Brian. You will not sit in the front. You'll sit in the back. Maybe I could drive and you could walk, Brian. You have got a very, very cheeky brain, and I don't like it. I don't know what's got into you. It's the same blue eye but a different attitude. A very, very cheeky robot. Cheeky? Cheeky, yes. -Cheeky bot. -Cheeky bot? Cheeky bot sit in the front, Brian. Stop saying "front." Front, front, front, front, front, front, front, front, front, front. -Are we there yet? -No. If you're good, I'll take you to the lake. - Lake? - Yes. I need to quickly stop at the shop, okay? -I'll come as well and say hello. -No, you won't. You've got to stay in the truck and keep your head down. Can we go to the swimming pool, Brian? Swimming pool? There is no swimming pool. Can we go to the airport? There is no airport. Can we go to the zoo, Brian? There is no zoo. There's a kennels. That's just dogs. - Dogs? - Yes, dogs. Right. I won't be long, okay? Don't do anything. Right? Hello. I am Charles Petrescu. Who are you, please? H-Hazel. Well, it's very nice to meet you, Hazel. What, uh... What are you? I am Charles Petrescu. Do you live in the fields with the sheep? No, I live in the village with my mum and a parrot. Parrot: an exotic jungle bird known for its flamboyant colors. Characteristic features include a strong, curved bill. Yes, he's green, and he's got red shoul... Did you know the most important components of most parrots' diets are seeds? Please don't tell anyone. -Please. -I-I won't. I won't. What is he? A robot. I am Charles Petrescu. Did you build him, Brian? Yeah. We're going to the lake for a walk. Oh, I-I'm... I'm sorry. - I didn't mean to... - No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. No, we're-we're just going... we were just going for a mooch about. Charles. Is Hazel coming? No. You should ask her to come to the lake. Very busy. She doesn't look like she is busy. She'll want to come to the lake. Uh... Do you want to? Do you want to come? Well, is that all right? How did you know how to build him? I wouldn't know where to start. Don't know. Just start at the beginning and use your imagination, I suppose. Would you like a game of "kick the stone," Brian?

Brian. Charles, don't put your... Sorry. Charles, don't put your feet in the water. I want to swim across the lake and check out the other side. Don't be ridiculous, swim across the lake. -You'd sink. -I would not. You can't go for a swim. We're going for walkie-walkies. You and Hazel can do your thing, -and I'll do my thing. -No. Come on. It's not fair. Life's not fair. Now, over here. Come on. Hoopla! Come on. Sorry. His toes get all wet and... I can't believe you made him. You should show him to people. Why not? Uh... Well, I'm impressed. Thanks. Thanks for inviting me. That's all right. You should come here more often. Think I will. Right. Home. -All right? -I better go. Yeah. Better go. - Bye, Charles. - Yeah. -Bye. -Yeah. Hazel? Can I have a word? Uh, I hope I'm not overstepping the mark here, but you know what I said to you about the... at the lake, about maybe you should come here more often? Well, wh-what I wanted to say was... And I didn't say it. I should have said it. Typical me. What I wanted to say was maybe we should come here more often? We? Uh... Not here. The lake. Okay. -Ooh. -Bye. Bye. What do you want for dinner tonight, huh? - Don't mind. - Chunky soup? I guess. - Get your head down. - Why? Just do as you're told. My head is as low as it can go. Beep-beep. Shush! Please. I want to go on the swings. Charles, please don't say anything. Just look straight ahead. -What is going on, Brian? -Oh, come on. Come on. Specky boy. Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, not a lot. I'm still in my dressing gown. Yeah, I'm a lazybones. Uh, I've got three dressing gowns. Don't know. Just like dressing gowns. - Hey. - Oh. Hang on. -What? -Who's that? Uh, it's Hazel. Just having a chat, all right? Yeah. Don't worry about me. Sorry. That was Charles. Yeah. Uh, would you fancy coming round later? Just for something to eat? Oh, great. Yeah. Oh, smashing. Okay. Well, I'll see you then. Bye, Hazel. Bye. Bye. Brian, I'm just popping out to get some bubble gum. No, you're not. Yes, I am. I need some bubble gum. No, you're not going anywhere. Relax, man. I won't be long. No, you won't be long, because you're not going. Unbelievable.

You should be pruning that. Huh? Come on. Your tie, all wonky. -Wonky tie. -Get off. I can do it. I can look after myself, Brian. I am not a child. I want to go on an adventure and see the world, and not just be stuck in stupid Ploxgreen Cottage with you. Don't talk to me like that, please. This whole place is boring, and you are boring. Charles, the way you're being lately-- I'm sorry, but I don't like hanging round with you anymore. Then let me go. What's got into you? Huh? Come on, Hazel. Just prune that, please. Sorry.

Absolutely embarrassed from head to foot. No, Brian. I could've duffed him to smithereens. Yeah, I could've whacked him on the schnozzle! But I didn't. -No, you didn't. -No, I didn't.
