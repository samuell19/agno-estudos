Are we there yet? Do you think we're there yet? Has the plane landed? I'm so bored. Hmm, my heart bleeds for you. I would love to entertain you, but I have to finish this paperwork. Your father needs it as soon as we touch down. Well, at least he'll be happy to see you. What did you do this time, Nicole? Oh, I love that. "What did I do this time?" Real supportive. I'm sorry. I thought we were talking about you. Ouch! Catty. You were tough enough to get kicked out of three schools, you're tough enough to hear the truth from me. Well, the truth being whatever happens minus my side of the story, right? Nicole, I've known you since you were two years old. I used to change your diapers in the office... "when your mother and father worked late." Yeah. You really got to get some new material, Andrea. You used to be this much of a good kid and this much of a brat. What happened? Well, I used to have parents. Now all I have is the president and ceo of teknacom. And still to this day, people continue to talk... About how dehumanizing the computer revolution is. Well, this is something I could never understand. You don't go from selling accounting software door-to-door... To becoming one of the largest software providers in the world... Without there being a very real, very vital human presence. The need for computers is human. Our desire to enhance our lives... Through computer technology is human. But computers aren't people. They're made for people and by people. But as accurate and reliable as they are, they're... they're just tools, nothing more. Now, with this major expansion of teknacom, I'm striving to bring the human factor... To this cold world of technology. Now, when my wife and I started this company, we had nothing but an old alegra computer and a screaming one-year-old. Now we have facilities all over the world, and we have a screaming 13-year-old. But, all kidding aside, the human factor in all of this... Is family. And it was the support and patience of my family... That allowed teknacom to grow. Soon people from all over the world... Will become part of our teknacom family. And then, and only then, will the real computer revolution... Begin. Thank you all very much. Nice to see you. Very nice to see you. Brilliant speech, Mr. stone. Thank you, Martin. Would you mind checking on the status of Nicole's flight? Certainly, sir. Hi, ray. Hi, Marilyn. Hi. It's good to see you. "Brilliant speech, Mr. stone." Family is everything, isn't it? Great speech, ray. Great, great speech. I wonder if anyone would have liked your speech this morning. I'm not the first man who's gotten into a shouting match with his daughter. Mmm. Hi, Mr. stone. Hi. How are you? Nice to see you. - True enough. - Hi, Mr. stone. Still you have to admit, it's a little bit strange... To hear you speak about family values when we can't even have... A phone conversation with our daughter without getting into a yelling match. Watch Oprah. Families yell at each other all the time. I enjoyed it so much. And besides, she started it. Great. So you're both four years old. Is that it? Who cares if Roberto clemente was the greatest baseball player... wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't... wait a minute. Roberto clemente was the greatest baseball player of all time. And second of all... super, super speech. You and I both know that this argument had nothing to do with baseball players. Hi. Hi. Good evening. She's trying, ray. No, she's not trying. People who try don't get... hi. They don't get kicked out of schools all over the world over and over again. People who try, try. I don't get it. On her reports she used to get straight a's, but over the last couple of years, now that things are starting to go well for us, it seems like all she wants to do is annoy people. Shh. Hi. Don't say anything to me. Why not? Because if you say anything to me, it'll insult me, and if you insult me, I'll get angry, and if I get angry, you'll know what will happen. Nothing happens when you get angry, Frank. You just eat more. Andrea, aren't you supposed to be watching her? Oh, I am watching her. I'm watching her annoy you for a change. Can you stop? Thank you. I don't get it. I really don't get it. What happened to you? Well, people change. Look, you used to be thin. I suppose you think that's funny. It's not. It's just mean. Look, I don't know if you've heard, Frank, but I am mean... And obnoxious... And a disappointment. You're only gonna be a disappointment if you keep going down the path you're on. I don't want to see you turn into some cold, selfish, rich brat. I hate what you're becoming. Listen, honey. You know your family's the only family I've got. And you're probably as close as I'm gonna get to having my own kid. You remember... remember we took you first to the zoo? Or when your dad and I took you camping? Oh, my gosh! We were such spazzes. We had all that stuff happen with the raccoons... And with those poles falling down on us. You remember the fun we had? No. No, sorry I don't. Tower, this is flight 109. Eta is in, um, 95 minutes. Roger that, 109. We've been bouncin' around up here, catching the tail end of the storm. Roger, 109. I'm afraid that's not the last of it. Beware you'll be landing in snow. We copy, tower. Rain, sleet, lightning and now snow. Boy, these El ni√±o conditions are too weird. It's freezing out there. Hi, guys. What do you mean? You're from quebec. I thought you guys liked the cold weather. Why do you think I left? Hello, night shift. Hi. - Hey, check it out. - can somebody get me a weather update? What are the conditions gonna be like in the next few hours? A new toy for Jeff! You're a real man's man, aren't you, Jeff? I got the training wheels off my bike last week. She digs me. Okay! Once again, we enter the exciting world of air traffic control, people. Whoa, whoa. Donovan? Take a look at this. Yeah? What are all these switches and buttons and knobs for? Get rid of the toys. Ah, you have such a way with people, hmm? It's a gift. Before I forget... cell phone. Ah, thank you, sir. It's getting pretty rough out there. Yeah, well, it's not so good in here either. Fourth floor: Toys and games. Third floor: Electronics. Second floor: Women's wear. First floor... Let's try to scoot around this. Yes, sir! I hate flying through storms. I don't have the stomach for it. What's Greg doing with my father's plane? He's a good pilot. Why don't you just sit down and strap yourself in? I don't feel like it. There's some nasty weather out there tonight. Hey, take a look at this. What? Flight 109. Cutting it pretty close to that storm. Bickster, punch up a profile on 109. 109. Yes, 109. It's a 727 private. Those pilots are always in a hurry. You never see a commercial carrier try to edge around a storm like that. 1087, you are clear for takeoff. I'm gonna kill her. Nicole, will you sit down? Calm down. I'm gonna be airsick. Do you need something? Yeah. - Nicole, would you put that stuff back, please? - Half a second. Is that your father's Roberto clemente bat? How'd you get that? - He's gonna kill you. - Yeah? Well, he loves the bat more than he loves me. No, he's gonna love using that bat on you when he finds out it's gone. Come on! We're supposed to be avoiding this. Nicole, would you stop playing with the first-aid kit? We might need it. Relax! I'm gonna do a small impression. Please! Give me a break! "Luke, feel the dark side." Oh, I'm scared! Something isn't right. 1475, you must hold your current pattern. Call 'em up. Find out what the heck they're doing. Done. 109, 109, come in. 109, 109, please come in. Man, that thing's goin' right through the tail end of that storm. - Any answer? - Negative. 109, 109, come in, please. Tower to 109. Damn! Always on my shift. Give me a hard copy of 109's flight plan. Tower to 109. Do you copy? 109, this is tower. Go ahead. There, it's leveling out. Yeah, but it's still descending. Heading out of the storm? No. Something's still wrong. 109, this is tower. Do you read? Any answers? 109, 109, this is tower! Do you read? Just got a message from downstairs. A guy from teknacom called, wanting to know if 109 was landing on time. It's the boss's plane. And get this: His daughter's on board. Mr. stone. Excuse me. Yes, Martin. We have a problem. Hey, guys. Andrea, Frank, are you okay? Come on, Frank! Frank! Come on, guys! Andrea, please! Oh, my God. What happened? There was an explosion. I think it was lightning. I don't know. My head. Come on. I'm worried about Frank. He doesn't look too good. He's really bleeding a lot. What hit us? The first-aid kit. It got sucked right out of the hole. I know it's my fault! I'm sorry for playing around. The pilot. Okay. Stay here. Be careful. Greg. Terry. Oh, no. Andrea! They're both dead. I think they're both dead. Nicole! Who's flying the plane? Jeff, stay on it up here. Bickster, go down and take care of our vips. Mr. and Mrs. stone, come with me. What's happening with our daughter? At this point, we're trying to figure that out ourselves. Tower to 109, please come in. Whoa. Give me your hand. Hang on. I think I've got something. There. Try not to bleed on my dad's bat. Don't worry. I'll tell him it's your blood. This is unacceptable. I'm sorry, sir. That's all we know. When you say there's no radio contact, what exactly do you mean? I mean, they're receiving, but no one's answering. But the plane is still in the air? Oh, yes, yes. What happened? We don't know for sure. It appears they were trying to go around the tail of a storm. The storm shifted. It caught them by surprise. Look, our best bit of luck is that they're scheduled to land here, not over at international. They have way too much air traffic. Listen, you know who I am. Whatever it costs to get that plane to land here safely, I want you to do it. Sir, right now it's not an issue of expense. There's not much we can do until we get more information. He's alive. He's breathing. They're both alive. Hello? Hello? Mayday! Sos. Is anybody there? Mayday! Anyone? Sos? Come on. This is not working. Hello! Mayday, please! This is insane. They've kept us waiting here alone for ten minutes. Ray, they don't know anything. Well, they've got to know something! Ray, why don't you sit down? Oh, God. Maybe we should run the projections again. Already did it three times. Look, unless flight 109 changes course, and soon, we're gonna have a front-row seat when it comes down. It's gonna come down hard. Mayday. We have to figure out how to land. Yeah. Okay. Take it easy, okay? You don't look okay. I'm fine. I'll help out Greg, get him secure. I'll be back to help you, okay? Okay. Okay. Mayday. Tonight, 300 people paid a thousand dollars apiece to hear me speak... Because I'm rich, because I'm important. I'm the man of the year. For what? Our little girl is up there in trouble, and... I can't do anything to help her. Man of the year. Frank. Come on, guys. Stick with me here. Please don't make me handle this all on my own. Please! I tried the best I could. How's it going? Andrea! Oh, my God! Andrea! Oh, what'll I do? Oh, um... hello? Anybody there? How does this thing work? Hello? Anyone? Help, please! Hello! Work, you worthless piece of garbage! Please! Uh, 109, do you copy? 109, this is tower. Yes, I copy. - What is your status? - My "status"? My status sucks, that's my status. Put this on the speaker. Listen to me. There was an explosion in the plane. There's a hole in the wall. Everybody's hurt except me, and no one's flying the plane. My name is Nicole stone. I'm 13 years old, and I really don't wanna be here right now. Okay, Nicole, I hear you. I understand. Everything's gonna be just fine, okay? My name is Jeff, and I'm gonna talk you through this. Okay, keep talking to me, Jeff. You know those scenes in the movies where the stewardess has to fly the plane, and somebody like charlton heston has to talk them down? Well, I'm gonna be your charlton heston. Can you be my Brad pitt instead? Um, sure, but I'm a lot better-looking. Listen up. You've got 109. Everything else is off your plate. I'll have Carrie and Dave pick up the slack, all right? All right. Good luck. Jeff, I'm really scared. Yeah, I know you are, Nicole, but we're gonna get through this. I want you to try and stay calm, okay? Okay. Now, I want you to describe the control panel to me. Start from your far left. Look, I don't know what you want me to tell you. There's rows of lights, gauges, buttons and switches and dials... yeah, and in the middle here there's this big thing with levers. - I don't know. - Okay, Nicole, listen carefully. Do not touch those levers until I tell you to. Don't worry. I won't touch anything. Nicole, those levers are for landing the plane, and you are not ready to land that plane yet, understand? - Okay. And there's this light with "autopilot." - Is that what's flying the plane? - Yeah, so far. Okay. But there's this buzzing sound coming from it right underneath the panel. "Buzzing sound"? Oh, man. The autopilot is scrambled. What's going on? Somebody talk to me. Nicole, listen, we want to test the autopilot. - What do you mean, "test"? - Honey, it's real simple. Just hit the switch below the autopilot light. If the light goes out, turn it right back on, okay? Okay. It's not going out. That's okay. Um, we want you to try something else. I want you to grab the controls... the steering wheel in front of you... and pull back as hard as you can. It may fight you a little bit, but that's the autopilot. Pull it back as far as you can. If you do, that light will go out. It won't let me move it. That's okay, Nicole. Um, let it go. Just let the autopilot do its job. Just... sit back and try to relax. Stay with her. I'm gonna go talk to her parents. Nicole, you can call me bickster. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Run that by me again. I thought the autopilot was a good thing. It is. It's a great thing. It saves lives. In fact, it saved your daughter's life. So, why is it a problem? After the accident, the autopilot took control of the plane. That's what's flying the airplane, and it's bringing it down here to the airport. But isn't that what we want? The line of descent is all wrong. The autopilot's internal guidance system is scrambled. We cannot disengage the autopilot. And the autopilot is telling your plane to crash. Oh, it's getting cold. I guess it's a bad time to say "I'm sorry for being such a jerk lately." Listen, it's simple. We just get her to try to reconfigure the wave points. That's insane. You need an aeronautics engineering degree to do that. Maybe she can fight the autopilot enough to take it over to lake crenshaw. Water landing. Crenshaw's too far. She'll wind up taking out a city block. I wonder if they have any chutes on board? It wouldn't matter. They're all unconscious. And we still have to land the airplane. All right, listen. How about this: Nobody open their mouth unless they have a good idea, okay? Yes. We could start that with you. Shut up, bickster. Whatever, okay? We still have to contain the fire when it crashes. Listen, people. We don't have a learning curve here. We've got to get this right the first time. There is no second chance! That's my little girl up there, my coworkers, my friends! There is no next time for them. This is it! Look, I... I know you people know your jobs, but... That's our little girl. I'm begging you. Please! Mr. stone, I'm sorry, but it's against regulations to have you in here. Donovan, forget your precious regulations. He's right. We can discuss strategies and options all we want to, but time is the real enemy here, folks. Fine. Okay, fine. Now, two things have to happen within the next hour. One: That plane has to come down safely. And two: Those people have to get off the plane. Wait a minute. It doesn't necessarily have to happen in that order. We're going to have another plane... wait. Say that again. I can't hear you. - There's static. - Okay, Nicole, listen to me. I can't hear you. I didn't get all that. Something about another plane. Nicole, listen to me. We're going to send another plane up there to meet you. "Another plane." Yeah, I heard that. But the other plane will be a refueler. It looks like a flying gas tank. I copy. Good. Out of the back of the plane, there'll be something that looks like a long pole. It's called a boom. They use this to pump gas. Pump gas? Am I running out of gas? No! No, Nicole. Your fuel is fine. You don't have any problems at all. I want you to listen to me. The people that fly these planes are very, very good... At getting close to other planes in midair. That's why we're using one. But instead of using the boom to pump the gas, we're gonna transfer you and everyone else off of the plane, and put another pilot on the plane. Do you understand? I can't hear you. I didn't get that. Nicole, we're going to use the boom... To transfer you and everyone else off of that airplane. I can't hear you. - There's something wrong with my microphone. - Nicole, can you hear me? I didn't get that. Something about a boom? There's something wrong with my microphone. Nicole? Can you hear me? Nicole? Nicole. Come in. Nicole! Nicole. Nicole? - What happened? What happened? - I don't know. Well, how is she? Is it anything serious? Flight path is still holding, for whatever that's worth. It was just the communicator. I'm sure it was nothing more than that. I didn't even get a chance to talk to her. Why do you want to transfer everyone? That's dangerous. Why can't you just land the plane? We can't even be sure that the autopilot can be disengaged. And maybe our men will have to make a crash landing in some deserted area. Who knows what else she's dealing with up there. We know people are injured. We know they're unconscious. We cannot parachute these people. Our options are extremely limited. I'm afraid this is the way it has to be. Yes, we got an emergency situation here. Jeff? Tell me you have some good news. We're lucky. There's a guard refueler at Kensington, crewed up and ready to go. Night maneuvers. There's even a medic on board. And, sir, fortunately, this crew specializes in trouble. Well, then, they've done this sort of thing before. Well, frankly, no one has done this sort of thing before, but their experience and versatility make the odds a little better. Okay. The refueler's empty, so it's gonna move a lot faster than it normally does. Flight 109 is moving slower since the accident, so they should be side by side in about 15 minutes. That doesn't give 'em a lot of time. Sir, this couldn't have happened any faster. We're just lucky Jeff here came up with the idea when he did. Let's not get too excited just yet. The hard part's still to come. There's a midair transfer about to happen... That would be a challenge to the best professionals, and no one on 109 knows what to do. Oh, this stupid thing! Hello! I can't hear anything. Hello. Does anyone hear me? Jeff, are you there? Hello, Jeff? - Oh, this worthless piece of junk! Hey, Andrea, are you okay? Please stay with me. Come on. For once, I could use some adult supervision. Ohh! Why couldn't you have passed out when I was kissing Mike Adams last summer? You were wide awake then. And what about that time I wanted to have that beach party? I would have loved for you to drop off, but no. You're picking the worse times to be unconscious, you know that? I know you can hear me. They're gonna rescue us. You're gonna be okay. We're all gonna get out of this, I promise. I just wish I knew what to do next. It's a good thing I never grew up, huh? Yeah. Mr. and Mrs. stone, would it help you at all... If I showed you how we're gonna pull this off? Yeah. Please. Great. Come here. Okay. Let's say that this is your airplane, and this is the refueler. Now the boom. The boom is normally for transferring fuel... From one plane to another while they're both in flight. But we're gonna do something a little bit different. Instead of putting the boom at the front of the plane for refueling, we're gonna move the boom over to the side door here. There's a hatch in the back of this refueling plane. Now, someone's gonna open up the door, and we're gonna get a guy to slide across this boom here. He's gonna slide over into your airplane. Once he's inside, he's gonna transfer your daughter and everyone else... Back across the boom and into the refueler. Oh, God. That'll take care of our first problem. Then he's gonna try to keep the plane from wipin' out this airport. That's the plan, and it can work. I just wish there was some way to communicate this with your daughter. I'm gonna check on the others. You're in charge. You think you can handle it? Okay, excellent. I knew I could count on you. Okay, guys. I'm gonna tell you like I told Andrea. We're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be fine. You hear me? As soon as the other plane comes, all of our problems will be solved, I promise. It's okay. We have a problem. We've got to find a way to get that side door open. The refueler, channel four. The pilot's name is Lopez. Put it on speaker, Jeff. Go ahead. This is tower. Tower, this is usang 2-7, captain Lopez. - Copy that, Lopez. - Am I talking to the man who masterminded this plan? Yeah, in the flesh. You up for this? We are state of the art, my friend. But you've definitely made our night a little more exciting. My boomer tells me he should be able to waggle the probe into position. Wind shear allowing, I can hold it there. I just can't hold it forever. You just need to get that door open. I copy that, 2-7. I've just got to find a way to talk to her. Understood, tower. My guys are still rigging the cabling, and a medic is standing by. It looks like the tail end of the weather's behind you, so I don't think mother nature's gonna give us too many more problems. Roger that. We are 300 meters from target and closing. Tower, I have a visual on 109 now, and I'd say mother nature's already done her worst. Making our pass now, tower. Visual survey of damage... it's pretty much what you expected: Scoring along the fore end of the outer fuse, and there's a pretty nasty hull breach in the main cabin. But there's no apparent fuel leak and no apparent wing damage. Oh, thank God for that. You can say that again. See, if there was wing damage, we couldn't do this. The downwash from the refueler would put too much strain on 'em. - They'd snap right off. - - Tower, 2-7 moving into position. What's downwash? Now what? I'm seriously gonna lose it. I'm just gonna strap myself in before I get thrown out of this. Oh, my! Tower, we're holding position. Copy that, 2-7. Standing by. My boomer's ready to go. We're just waiting on the cabling. - Copy that, Lopez. - - It's time to get that door open. We have got to find a way to get back into contact with Nicole. Well, I'm pretty sure she knows the refueler is already up there by now. Yes, but if we don't get her to disengage the lock, we have no way of getting the people off the plane. Why can't they just open it from the outside? Because it won't work. The airplane doors are specifically designed... Not to open from the outside during flight. It's a safety feature. I know it's frustrating, but normally safety features save lives. This is a one in a bill... no, no. Jeez, it's a one in a trillion situation. Yes, it's frustrating, but... wait a minute. I don't know much about aircraft, but why does she have to open up the door at all? Isn't there a hole already in the side of the airplane? Now we know why you're the millionaire. 2-7, this is tower. When your cabling is in place, there's something I'd like you to try. Hey, now where are they going? Tower, we have cabling in place. We're rigging our man to go over. It's in the hands of the boomer now. Roger that, 2-7. Here we go. I really wish I knew what was going on over there. Target coming in. Rate: One foot per second. Steady. Go slow and steady. Even it up. Keep it steady. Come on. That's it. Pull back, Lopez! Pull back! Come on. Help me out down here. Uh-oh. Pull back, Lopez! We have to try it again. We'd like to take another go at it. Please advise. 2-7, we don't have a choice. Give it your best shot. Roger that. Go. All right. Here we go. Oh, I can't take it! I have to go see what's going on out there. Wait a minute. Slow and steady. Come on. Keep it steady. All right. Come to papa. Pipe: Five by five. Come on. Come on. Tension rate's good. Steady. Come on. Contact! It's in! All right, Reynolds, get up here. You're on. On my way. Excellent work, 2-7. Oh, that phone! Tower! 2-7, can you hold position for the transfer? We'll make it happen, tower. Never lost a man yet. Jeff! Take the phone! Hurry! - Yeah. - Do you know how much lying you have to do... To get an operator to connect you to a control tower? - Nicole? - What's happening, Jeff? How is she making this phone call? I thought the communications were fried. Andrea has a cell phone. Nicole, hang on. I'm gonna put you on the speakerphone. Nicole! It's daddy! Nikki, are you okay? Mom! Dad! Nikki, are you okay? Nicole, listen to me! Please! Tower, we've got our man ready to go. 2-7, we have contact with 109. Roger that. Please advise 109: Stay strapped in until the cable's in place. Our man will come to them, once inside. Copy, 2-7. Nicole, we need you to stay right where you are. - Someone's coming over now. - Coming over on that pole thing? - That's right. - I'm gonna get everyone ready. No, Nicole, please. Stay where you are, sweetie. Let our man come to you. Understand? I can get everyone out of here faster. I'm the only one that's not hurt. I'm just terrified. Just do what they say, okay? That's right, honey. You listen to Jeff. Tower, we're catching some bow wave from 109. I need some time to stabilize before I send my man over. Roger that. Yeah, the refueler's getting jostled by... The air your plane is pushing ahead of itself. Usually, this wouldn't be a problem, because when the refueler's full of gas, it's heavy enough not to be affected. I thought that no gas was a good thing. A few minutes ago it was. What's going on? Everything's getting shaky. You're picking up turbulence. The two planes are batting some air back and forth. - Is that bad? - It's not good or bad, Nicole. It... it just is. Hang in there. - Tower, come in. - This is tower. Go ahead. I don't know how much longer we can maintain connection. I want to try and stabilize before I send my man over. Understood, 2-7, but we are running out of time. Tower, I have a suggestion. Right now the boom is just sitting there in the breach of the hull. There's a locking device in the tip of its probe. Usually it's activated when it snaps into the fuel port. If we can get the passenger to activate the device manually... - it would help hold the boom in place. - F.A.B., tower. That should buy us enough stability to send our man over with the cable. No. It's gonna be too dangerous for the girl. - Yeah. He's right. - As opposed to the situation she's in now? Why can't they activate this thing themselves by remote control? Because they can't. It has to come in contact with the fueling port. In our case, we make it think it has. Let me guess. It's a safety feature. Let me get this straight. First you tell me not to move. Now you're telling me to move? Nikki, listen. You can do this. Just do what they tell you to do. It's okay. Okay. Nicole, on the end of the boom is a large nozzle. That's what's sticking through the hole in the airplane. Hit it as hard as you can. If you do, it'll open up like an umbrella... And help hold the boom in place. - Hit it? You mean, punch it? - Yes. No, no, no, no. Don't hit it with your fist. Find something stronger. Anything. Don't sweat it. I got something. Okay, I'm going in. You want me to hit this thing as hard as I can? - That is correct. Excellent. Oh, my God. - Tower, things are getting very unstable up here. - Copy, 2-7. Hold still. I can't stabilize. We're lo... Lopez, we're losing it. I can't hold it. We're losing it. The boom's gonna shred the cabin. Get the girl outta there now! Nicole, get out of the cabin now! I can't hold it. We've lost it! We've lost it! They've separated. Tower? Tower, do you copy? Tower. Go ahead. We couldn't maintain the distance. We got knocked out of range. We've lost the boom. Repeat: We have lost the boom. Oh, God. There's additional damage to the fuselage of 109. And without the boom, we can't do anything. Sorry. Hello? Does anyone hear me? It's mom and dad. We're here. Carrie, get coordinates and try to find out where that boom's going to hit. - Already on it. - Nicole, are you all right? - Yeah, I guess. - We had a problem with the refueler. The boom got pulled away from the airplane and... I know. I was in here. But listen to me. The hole is even bigger. That boom thing tore it open even wider. I'm afraid we're gonna fall out. Did you copy that, 2-7? Copy. Tower, we're out of ideas up here. Don't see how we can facilitate a midair transfer now. Uh, 2-7, maybe you could, uh, extend a man out over the breach, set up the tether that way. It wouldn't hold for transfer. We'd lose everyone. That's why we were gonna use the boom... for the extra support. - Hey, what's going on? - Stand by, Nicole. Somebody give me an idea, please! We have to initiate emergency airport evacuation right now. You can't leave my baby up there. I'm sorry, but there's a lot more people in harm's way. Thirty minutes from now, this airport becomes ground zero, and I gotta worry about them. I'm sorry, Jeff. He's right. Bickster, alert airport authority. Priority red one evac plan. Dave, Carrie, alert all personnel. We're closing down the airport. Divert them to their alternatives. Let's go! Operations, this is tower. We have a code red. Repeat: Code red. Initiate evacuation procedures immediately. This is not a drill. Repeat: This is not a drill. Carrie, make sure all inbounds are diverted. Dave, check the radar and make sure we aren't missing anybody. Mr. stone, we have a... Situation here where... Jeff. Please. That is correct, sir. This airport's closed until further notice. Uh, please repeat, tower. If I heard right, then whoever thought of this is a genius. Okay, 2-7, if we can get the landing gear down, we can have the man crawl up into the nose wheel. Literally have him crawl through the lower fuselage. If you still got the cabling on, he can attach it in the wheel well... And start pulling people through the floor panel in the cabin. We'll give it a shot, but please be aware the air is getting thicker. There's more friction. The ride is gonna get a lot rougher. Copy that, 2-7, but we have to try. - This is only gonna work if the landing gear is down. - Roger that. Nicole, do you understand what you have to do? Sure. First you tell me to go in the cockpit, then in the cabin; then you want me to go back into the cockpit and then back into the cabin. I guess you want me to go in the cockpit now, right? Right. You got it. I don't wanna leave these guys out here. The hole is really big now. I understand, but the best thing you can do for them right now... Is to get that landing gear down. Okay. I really don't want to fall out. Okay. I'm here in the cockpit. Now what? We're gonna try to do something we've done before. I'm gonna talk you through the control panel, okay? I understand, yeah. On the right-hand side, I need you to find the control pillar. Okay. You see it? Yeah, I see it. Now, there should be six lights right above it. Uh, I guess, but they're not lit up. That's okay. When the wheels are down, the lights will go on. Okay. Lower the handle, and tell me if the lights come on, okay? Keep something in mind before you hit that switch. If the wheels come down, it will slow the plane. Okay. That's the autopilot reacting to it. There's gonna be a lot of turbulence. More turbulence? It should settle out. We think once the wheels are down, the autopilot will compensate by bringing your plane down faster. Faster? Your angle of descent will become steeper. That's perfectly normal. I do not want you to worry about that when that happens. Well, it's worrying me. Once the landing gear is down, we can have you off that plane in ten minutes. Okay, here it goes. I can't. It's not working. Well, try it again. Make sure you press it all the way. I guess that's the turbulence. - Tower, I see the landing gear. - Yes. All right, boys. We're gonna try this again. Let's get it right this time. All right. Okay. All right. Here he goes. Here they go. Close in about 20 feet. Closing. That's too fast. Slow it down. - Yeah! - So did it work? Hello? Did it work? Stand by, Nicole. 2-7? We have contact. Ya-hoo! - Tower, we have contact. - Nicole, we have contact. Stay right where you are. You're about to have some company. Nicole? Nicole, come in! - Nicole, come in! - Why isn't she answering? I don't know. Ten minutes, huh? Let's try and cut that in half. Jeff said the rescue guy was coming through here. The faster I get these people ready, the faster we get off this thing. - Hey, rescue guy. - Yes? Well, let's start rescuing. There's three more, plus me. Okay! We're ready for the first transfer. Tower, we're ready for the first transfer. - Is it Nicole? - I... I don't know. Coming down. Get up here! Come on! Let's move it! We have transfer. Is it her? Adult female. Andrea. It's Andrea. All right. She's clear. A-ask them... what happened to my baby. Ask them. 2-7, what's the status on the little girl? Can't say for sure, tower. Female is unconscious. Possible head trauma. She can't tell us anything. What happened to my little girl? There's two more, plus me. All right. Let's not forget about me. Ready for second transfer. - Lopez, it's getting real bad out here. Let's move! Okay, we got him. As soon as he's clear, take him back there. This cable isn't gonna hold. Tower, we have second transfer... adult male. It's one of the pilots. Tower, it's starting to get a little rough up here. There's one more, plus me, and I might need help with this one. He's coming down! Frank, please! Please wake up. Help me! Please! Please. Okay. Unhook him. We got two more, and that's it. Come on. Frank. Come on, Frank. We're running out of time. - Nicole, we got to go now! - We're not gonna make it. Tower, come in. We have the little girl and one last man still on board 109. I don't think we'll be able to get both. 2-7, can you transfer both of them at once? Negative, tower. Cable won't hold. It's barely holding as is. Come on! There's no more time! We gotta go, now! Frank! Frank, please! Please wake up! Help me! I love you. I remember. I remember everything. Just please wake up. Let's get out of here. Help me. I'll never disappoint you again, I promise. Please! - I can't leave him. - Come on! We gotta go. - I can't leave him here. Help me, please. - We gotta go now! We're losing it. Guys, we're losing it! Release the winch! Release the winch! - Reynolds! - We gotta go, Nicole! No! - Lopez, we've lost Reynolds! - Tower, we lost a man. Repeat: We lost a man. Damn it! Tower, I have a confirmed signal. Our man opened his chute. 2-7, what about the other two passengers? What about the girl? Negative, tower. Our man doesn't have them. They're either lost in transfer... Or still on board the plane. No. I wish there was something more we could do. We'll have to abort the mission. S-stand by, 2-7. Understood, tower. I'm sorry. No. No, she's still up there. Nicole and Frank are still up there. Nikki, pick up the phone! Nikki! Nikki, pick up that phone! Nikki! Nikki. I really want to get off this airplane now. Oh, my God. Nikki. Oh, Nikki. What happened to you? I was trying to speed things up. I moved everybody over. I saw a man fall from the plane. Is he all right? Is everybody okay? Yes, honey. You saved their lives. You did great, honey. I love you. I miss you, dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let you down. No, you didn't let me down. That never happened, Nicole. I let you down. I spent so much time trying to make things happen... For all of us that... no. You never let me down. And I've never been so proud... Or loved anybody as much as I do you right now. I love you, dad. I love you, Nicole. I love you! Jeff? Yeah. N-Nicole, I'm right here. You said I could land this plane like in the movies, right? Right, but, Nicole, you can't take over the controls... As long as the autopilot won't disengage. You try, but you just keep fighting the autopilot, and the autopilot wins. Well, the autopilot's not as pissed off as I am. Where's the autopilot located? Near the window? Actually, it's in the rear of the plane. It would take an expert to go through the circuitry to disengage the autopilot. - Understand? - Whatever. I figured out how to disengage the autopilot. You... you what? I'm flying the plane, but I don't know how to fly. Something's up. - Abrupt change in 109's flight path. - She's flying the plane. She's flying the plane! Nicole, I want you to grab the controls, the, uh, the steering wheel in front of you, and pull back towards you until the plane levels out. - Do you understand? - Okay. Nicole, to make this work, you have to do exactly what I tell you to do. Tell me. On the left side of the panel in front of you, there's a round ball with a horizontal line running through it. Do you see it? Yeah. Right. I see it. It's like a small "w," small, tiny plane type thing. That's right. I want you to move the steering wheel... To keep the part of the ball where black meets white... Even with the white horizontal line that's in the glass. Move the controllers forward or back? Back, Nicole. Ease it back. Now what? I want you to ease the controls forward now. The altimeter will change positions, but try to keep the two lines even, even though they're not together anymore. Okay. Now what? Keep the wings of the little plane lined up with the horizon. If one wing is higher, move the control in that direction to level it out. If the right wing's higher, I move it to the... - to the right. - Okay, the right. Okay, I got it. Good. Now, Nicole, once the wings are level, start pulling the controls back. Understand? That will mean your wings are holding steady... And that you're lowering the plane for landing. Okay, I... I'm doing it, I think. You're doing great, Nicole. Now, remember, there's gonna be some turbulence. There's always turbulence. Just remember, stay calm. Ease the steering wheel back. Keep the altimeter even. Okay. I got it, I think. You'll feel yourself, see yourself getting lower. Yeah, I do. I am. Good. Now, we should be able to see you from here very soon. Any minute now, you should be seeing a strip of landing lights. They'll look like they're almost floating right in front of you. I can see them. Oh, God, I can't do this. Please don't make me do this. Nicole... you can. You can do this. You can do anything, if you don't quit. We need you. Do you hear me? Okay, dad. Okay. Okay, Jeff, what's next? Nicole, I want you to aim the plane right between the landing lights. At the same time, I want you to pull back on the steering wheel. The lights won't fill your windows anymore. Do you understand? Yeah. Okay. Now listen carefully. As you're landing, I need you to hit the three levers to your right-hand side. One, two, three. Left to right. Then jam your foot into the brakes. I can't believe I'm landing this plane. Nicole, you're doing fine. Jeff? Jeff? I don't believe it! Nicole? Nicole! I have a visual! Where? Fifteen hundred feet... And dropping. How many crash teams did you send to the runway? - All of them. - stand by. I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die. nine hundred feet. She's a little uneven. Eight hundred feet. Come on, Nicole. I'm not gonna crash. I'm not gonna crash. I'm not gonna crash. Oh, please, God. 350 feet. She's still uneven. Come on. You can do it. Two hundred feet. Please, please. At least for my mom and dad. Come on. Come on. This is not gonna be pretty. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. 125 feet. Please, God, just for my baby. She's gonna do it. A hundred feet, damn it. Eighty feet. Prepare for impact. Fifty feet. Oh, shit! Yes, she's down! She's going too fast. No reverse thrusters. - She can do it. - She has to hit those switches in order! What did he say? What did he say? Left to right. Left to right. - Left to right. Come on! - She'll do it. I told you, she'll do it. Do it, baby. Come on, Nicole. Left to right. - One. - One. Come on. Two. Come on. Two. - Three. - Three. Yes! Yes! Yes! All right! Hey! Oh, good. Good. Nicole! Dad! Oh, honey! Oh, Nikki! I love you, baby. Sorry, dad. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shh! Oh, it's okay, honey. It's okay. It's okay. No, dad. Dad. Shh, shh, shh! No, I need to tell you... what? What? Roberto clemente really was the greatest baseball player of all time. Oh, honey. Oh, dad. Hey, Nicole. Sorry about the Brad pitt thing. It's okay. My folks won't let me date until I'm 16, anyway. Left to right? Left to right. Closed-captioned by captions, inc. Los Angeles
