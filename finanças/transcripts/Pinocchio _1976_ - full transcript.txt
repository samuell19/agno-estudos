(upbeat orchestral music) (dramatic electronic music) (chicken clucks) - [Teresa] Papa? - [Papa] No, no! - [Teresa] Papa! - Teresa, I am your father! I forbid it. - I am your daughter. I really demand it, Papa. - Oh! Put those behind there. - Papa, this is my last performance after tonight. I really must leave. - Teresa, why are you doing this? Ever since you were five years old, you have been part of this company. - I'm tired of it. - But this is your life! - If it is, then please let me live it. - [Papa] Ah! - Papa, there's a world out there. I want to see it! - But you have seen it. We travel all over. - One small town after another. - Please. We played Milano. - Please. We played Treviglio. - Well, it's near Milano. - Papa, how can I make you understand? I wanna live in the same city for a week, for a month, for a year if I feel like it. - Teresa, you make me laugh. To be in the same city for one year, you know what will happen to you? - Yes, I would like to meet a boy who doesn't have to follow me to the next town if he wants to see me again. - Ah, ah! Now we are coming closer to the truth. - [Teresa] What? - You met a boy and you want to leave the company. - Papa, no, I haven't met him yet. All I know is I want more out of life. I want something that could- (goat bleats) Papa, look. Goats. - Teresa? Teresa. - I'm sorry. - I do understand. I know what you're saying. It's just that, well, you're such a part of me. My little Teresa. - You're acting. - Well, sometimes. (Teresa laughs) No, but I really love you, Teresa. You know that. - I do, Papa. But when you love someone, you know when to hold on and when to let go. I'll always love you too, Papa. - Then you'll stay? - No Papa. It's no use. After tonight, I'm leaving. After tonight, I'm finished. - Teresa, you think you are finished? Let me explain something to you. You can finish with traveling. You can finish with small towns. You can finish with me. But you can never finish with theater. In your life, you will never find anything so filling, as exciting, as rich as the theater. - Papa, would you look around you! We are a third rate troop in a fourth rate village in a 10th rate theater. - Teresa, it will change. - Oh, Papa. - After this new play that I've written, things will change, Teresa. - You said that about the last play. - Yeah, but this one is different. This time it's different. I know it. I feel it. I sense it. - I give you tonight. - And I will give you forever. Starting tonight, you will no longer be known as Teresa Clody. You will be remembered always as Pinocchio.

That's where we're going. (footsteps stomp) - Oh, I wanna be a real boy like Candlewick and have fun. What would Papa say? He'd say, "Pinocchio, I'm a warning you. "You go to school, eh? Or I spank a you bottom." Im going to school, Papa. I'm going to school. (cheerful upbeat music) (Pinocchio giggles) - Hurry, hurry, hurry! It's the greatest puppet show on earth. The world famous Stroganoff Marionettes, presented by the Great Forest Stroganoff himself. Hurry, just a few tickets left. - Meow'll have one. I just can't wait to see those terrific little puppets singing and dancing. - Don't overdo it, honey. You're being paid to shill, not give a free show. Yes, see the Stroganoff puppets singing and dancing their little hearts out. So real, so lifelike, you'll wanna take them home and mother them. Where do you think you're going? - I was going in to see the puppet show. - Not without a ticket you're not. This is a funny-looking kid. - Then may I please have a ticket? - Okay.

Well, nothing except this brand new spelling book and you can't have that. - Why would he want your spelling book? - Papa says it'll make me rich. - [Both] Rich! - Oh, you're in luck, kid! He's a sentimental softie. - Tell you what I'm going do. At great personal sacrifice, I will take that spelling book in exchange for a ticket of admission. - No. No, I couldn't. You see my poor Papa sold his coat to buy the book. - Ah, there's the ice cream song. (cheerful upbeat music continues) No real little boy would wanna miss that. - No, I wouldn't. Here. - Okay, sonny, go right through that door, the one that says, "This way." - Yes sir. Oh, I just remembered.

I tell you who when you tell me where. - We tell you where when you tell us who! - Where? - Who? - Where? - Who? - Where? - We'll pay ya to tell us. - All right, how much? - Five gold coins. - Very good. (laughs) - Okay. Who's giving the reward? - Me. - [Both] You? - You're just a poor woodcarver. (coins clang) - Not anymore. - We've been swindled! - You want a reward? You tell me where Pinocchio is, eh? - We saw a funny-looking kid- - That's a no funny-looking kid. I make him myself. I carve his face. I carve his head. I carve every thing! - Well, whatever he is, you'll find him near a wood pile. - Thank you. - Hey, wait a minute. Where is our reward? - Oh yes. A reward. You give me your name and address. If I find this a funny-looking kid, as you call him, where he's supposed to be, I send you the reward, eh? - You don't trust us? - No, I don't trust anybody who will steal a book from a little boy. You know what I think, I think your reward will be I don't call the police. If I call the police, they put you in jail. You know how much they fine you? - [Both] Five gold coins. (coins clang) - That's a right. Better me than the police. I keep the coins. You keep your freedom. That's your reward, eh? Right? Goodbye. So long. Toodaloo. Smell something nice. - The word curses comes to mind. You can't trust nobody no more. - Well. - You and your big mouth. - You did it again. - You did it! I told you! - Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Where are you, Pinocchio? Ah! Pinocchio! (Geppetto groans) Get up, my Pinocchio. Please. (Pinocchio coughs) Ah! Are you all right? - Papa! (Geppetto and Pinocchio cry and groan) - Are you healthy? You fine. You look all right. My boy, I hug you. (lips smack) I kiss you. (laughs) I beat you. I spank you. I break your head. Where you been, you bad boy? - You won't believe me. - No, I don't believe you. I don't believe you. If you told me you no go to school, I spank you bottom. - No Papa. I went to school. - You did? - Oh boy. Boy, I sure did go to school. (coughs) But on my way to school, a giant eagle swooped down on me. - Eh? - And I fought him bravely. But he grabbed my spelling book and he flew away. - That's a terrible. I think maybe he hit your nose before he left, huh? - Well, I knew I couldn't go to school without a spelling book. - Naturally not, no. - So I remembered that you sold your coat to buy that book. And I decided that that's what I would do. So I went to a coat buyer. (nose squeaks) He was a mean, cruel man. And he was very tall and very fat. And he looked like a giant monster. (nose squeaks) (Pinocchio laughs) - That's a very smart. - So I left right away. And what do you think I ran into this time? - A door? - No, that giant eagle again. - [Geppetto] Oh. - Only this time, Papa, he picked me up and he dropped me right on that pile of wood. - Oh, that's too bad. - And then this dragon came along and he set fire to the wood. - [Geppetto] Mm-hmm. - And then a witch put a curse on my nose. - Yeah. - Papa, what's happening to me? - What's happening to you, Pinocchio, is you told a lie, eh? And when you lie, it's a plain like the nose on your face. So if you want your nose to grow back- - Uh-huh. - You better tell the truth. - I'll tell the truth, Papa. I promise I'll always tell- - The truth! - This is what really happened, Papa. (cheerful upbeat music) - Well, that's a different. Now it's as a plain as your nose on my face. (nose squeaks) - I'm sorry. And I'll never be bad again. - Very good. All right, take your spelling book. Here is your five a gold coins. And we start our life all over, eh? - Mm-hmm. - Now I hope you learn your lesson. Because sometimes when you look for more, you find a less, eh?

I have to find that boy because it's important I find him. Good evening, Sir. I know you will take a good care of him, so I don't worry. Of course I'm a little surprised you let him run away. (laughs) I guess maybe your eye was on some other little boy that day, eh? And if you think some other little boy is more important than Pinocchio, it's all right. I mean, I don't tell you how to run your business, eh? (laughs) You do pretty good job up to now. Ma, I have to find him. I have to find him. If I don't find him on the land, I will look on the ocean. If a Columbus found America, Geppetto will find Pinocchio. Thank you. (blows air) (somber music) - Didn't I tell ya Pinocchio? Ain't this the greatest? - Yeah, it sure is. - Here. Have a chaw of this tobacco. - What is it? Does it taste like candy? - [Group] Oh yeah, yeah. - Just like candy! All the big boys chew it. - Oh.

Didn't you know that all boys that were lazy and don't go to school and do nothing but amuse themselves must sooner later finish up as the silly jackasses they really are. (Group brays) - All right! Line up and prepare to be shipped out. (Group brays) - Shut! You're breaking my heart. Now listen to this! You'll be donkeys. You'll be soulless pack animals.
