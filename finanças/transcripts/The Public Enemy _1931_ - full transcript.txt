MAN 1: Larry, give me one of those kind of cigars, will you? [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] MAN 2: Fill them up, will you? NEWSBOY: Extra, extra! Extra, extra! Paper? Extra! Extra, extra! Read all about it! [MARCHING BAND PLAYING] NEWSBOY: Extra! Read all about it! Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Give us a swig. NEWSBOY: Extra! GIRL: Hello, Tommy. Hello. Can greased? Come on, Matt. We got business. Give us a little kiss, huh? - That's what you get for fooling with women. - Ah. BARMAN: Hey, you boys. Stop! Stop, I tell you. Stop that! BARMAN: Oh, I beg your pardon. [TOM & MATT LAUGHING] BARMAN: Officer, get those boys. MAN: You little imp! If I get ahold of you... Hey, Matt. Look. - Aw, that ain't fair, Tom. - What do you care? It's only a girl. - Well, she's my sister, ain't she? - What difference does that make? Hold me up, Matt. Leave her alone. She's doing fine. That's the way to learn. That's just like you, Tom Powers. You're the meanest boy in town. MATT: He is not. He give you the skates, didn't he? I believe he did it just so he could play that trick on me. I'm gonna tell your brother Mike. Aw, go ahead and tell him. Here he comes now. MOLLY: You'll help me, won't you, Mike? - Where'd you get the skates, Molly? - Tom gave them to me. - Tom did? Where'd you get them, Tom? He got them from a kid who owed him some money. [MATT LAUGHS] I bet you stole them, Tom. Give them back, Molly. Say, why don't you mind your own business? Nobody asked you to put your two cents in. Here, Tom. I don't want them if you stole them. - Oh, so you're getting like sissy Mike too. - Take them, Tom. Say, you ain't so darn good. Your old man swipes pigeons. Tom Powers, he does not. You're a big liar. He's in jail, ain't he? They don't put people there for nothing. Everybody who belongs there ain't there. That's where you'll be some day, Tom Powers. Well, I ain't there yet. And if I do go, it won't be for swiping pigeons. Tell him you were only kidding, Tom. [MRS. POWERS HUMMING] How do you want them this time, up or down? [MAN SINGING NEARBY] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MAN 1: Hello, there. How are you? MATT: How's she going? MAN 2: Hit me. - Hit you. There you are. MAN 2: Hit me again. - Hit you. There's one. Better hit you again. There you go. [SINGING] Lizzy Jones, big and fat Slipped on the ice and broke her— [MAN WHISTLES] [BOYS LAUGHING] All right. I'll be back in a minute, boys. I'll be back in a minute. Hello, boys. What's up? We've got something. [BOYS CHATTERING] - Where'd you get them? - Wentworth Avenue. MATT: How much are they worth? Oh, not much. Just cheap watches. Cheap watches? A buck apiece. MATT: Yeah, and there's six of them too. I don't know what I can do with them. They're hot. Aw, come on, quit stalling, Putty Nose. You know how to sell them. Heh. You're too smart. - Well, I'll see what I can do with them. - How much do we get? Well, what do you say to half a buck for each of you? - Half a buck? Aw. - I ain't cheating you, Tom. That's a good price. I have to take all the risk. And maybe I can't sell them at all. Give us the half a buck. You know old Putty Nose always plays on the square with you, don't you? Hey, this is only two bits. Yeah, and this is only a nickel. Oh, my mistake. - Yeah. - Sorry. Then you both owe me a month's dues to the Club, don't you? - That's right, Tom. - Yes, so we're calling that square, see? - That's all right, isn't it? - Sure. PUTTY NOSE: You done a good stroke of business. And if you find anything more... ...you just remember old Putty Nose, won't you? Okay. That's right. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Heh. What do we want with a couple of young squirts like them for? They ain't gonna be so bad. And they won't expect much of a cut. PUTTY NOSE: Hey there, Tom. - Hello, Putty Nose. - Hello, boys. MAN: Hey. Are you alone? I'm always alone when I'm with Matt. You looking for a sock on the button? I was afraid you might have brought Mike with you. Ah, that sucker. He's too busy going to school. He's learning how to be poor. Oh. Ain't he working on the street cars anymore? Sure. He's a ding-ding in the day time. Goes to school at night. What did you want us for, Putty? Uh, something sweet. Remember how I always said... ...when I got something good I'd cut you in? Yeah. Well... PUTTY NOSE: Now, Dutch here knows the whole layout. We've been casing the joint for a whole week. - How about the cops? PUTTY NOSE: You ain't afraid of cops? There ain't gonna be no trouble. And if there is, I promise you that I'll protect you. Now, Limpy here will be lookout. The place is dead at night anyhow. Well, are you on? Well, we ain't never done nothing so big. PUTTY NOSE: Big. Big is right. I'm giving you a break like I promised. Furs. Furs is worth plenty nowadays. Well, how about you, Tom? It's kind of new stuff for me. PUTTY NOSE: Well, you gotta grow up sometime. Wait a minute. [CLATTERING AND THUDDING] Christmas present from Santa Claus. With best wishes for a prosperous New Year. - Gee, I'm scared stiff. - Come on. There's nothing to be scared of. Is that so? Look at you. You're shaking yourself. Take it off me, will you? [WHISTLE BLOWING] Stop! Thought you'd get away, did you? They got Limpy Larry. POLICEMAN: Stop there! [WHISTLE BLOWING] Putty. Putty Nose! Where is that big loogan? Where's Putty? We knocked off a— Yeah, I know all about it. Putty knows it. Beat it. You better lay low for a while. The heat's on. But Putty Nose got us into this. He promised to see us through. Why, the dirty no good yellow-bellied stool. I'm gonna give it to that Putty Nose right in the head the first time I see him. Yeah, you and who else? [WOMAN SOBBING] Oh, my Larry. He was a good boy. Larry got what he asked for. I warned him. He was a no-good boy. My Larry was a good boy. He got into bad company, that's all. Oh, come here, Tommy boy. I'm so glad you came, Tommy. Mrs. Dalton will be pleased to see some of Larry's nicer friends. [PEOPLE SHOUTING] NEWSBOY: U.S. declares war! Read all about it! Hey, U.S. declares war! Read all about it! Wait a minute, Tom. Here comes Mike. NEWSBOY: Read all about it! I wish you'd come on home with me, Molly. I don't know just how to tell Ma. All right, Mike. That sister of yours ain't getting any bargain in Mike. Hey, how come he ain't working? I guess he got fired for snatching too many nickels. - Say, they look like something's happened. - Come on. We gotta see Paddy. You don't need to stall with Paddy Ryan, Tom. I have been watching you ever since you bought your first drink from me. I know what you've been doing. Well, you see, Paddy, it's like this. We delivered some cigars today, must be worth about $2,500. Took them to a place on 63rd and was told to put them in the back. - We could lift them easy tonight. - But we don't know what to do with them. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] You sell cigars, don't you? Not that kind. Can't afford it. I've got my own system, boys. But being a fence ain't part of it. - Well, we thought maybe you know somebody— - Maybe I do. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Yeah? You might take them there. I'll call up and say you're coming. Thanks, Paddy. Wait a minute. If you get in a jam, give me a ring. You'll find out Paddy Ryan's your friend. Thanks, Paddy. Why do you want to front for us? We ain't never done nothing for you. Maybe not. But I may need a friend myself sometimes. I'm older than you, and I've learned that nobody can do much without somebody else. Remember this, boys. You gotta have friends. I've been watching you and hearing about you, and I've been worried. I was worried when you got mixed up with that two-timer, Putty Nose. Aah. Such guys are dangerous. I'm glad you come to me. So far as Paddy Ryan's concerned there's only two kinds of people... ...right and wrong. Now, I think you're right. You'll find that I am, unless you cross me. That's swell. [PADDY CHUCKLES] [MRS. POWERS CRYING] Don't cry. Everything will be all right. Hello, Ma. Tommy. Oh, Tommy boy. You won't leave me, will you, Tommy? You're all I've got left now, Tommy boy. What's the matter, Ma? What's up? Mike's enlisted. Enlisted? In the Army? MOLLY: In the Marines. But you won't go, Tommy? Promise me you won't go. You're— You're just a baby. Oh, now, listen, Ma... If your Pa was alive I wouldn't care so much. Promise me, Tommy. I won't go, Ma. When's he going? As soon as he gets his call. He's up packing now. MRS. POWERS: Go up and see him, Tommy. We— We ought to be very proud of him. TOM: Hello, Mike. Hello, Tom. I'm glad you came. I suppose you've heard? Yeah. Kind of rushing it, ain't you? Well, Tom, when your country needs you, she needs you. Yeah. - I suppose you think I ought to go too. - No. Maybe it was selfish of me, Tom... ...but somebody's got to stay here and take care of Ma. You earn more money than I do and they'd have called me first anyway. You always did get all the breaks. Oh, don't take it like that, Tom. You've got to be the man of the family now. And while we're on the subject, I wish you'd try to stay home a little more. - I gotta work, ain't I? - Oh, sure. Listen, Tom. I was in a place today and I heard somebody say something. Well, what of it? Well, they were saying— Well, it seemed as though they were pointing a finger at you and Matt. Who was? What rat would say anything about me? Now, take it easy. You're always hearing things. You'll get too much in your nose someday... - ...and wonder how you got it. - For crying out loud. I heard guys talking about you. As much as to say, you were in on crooked work. What am I supposed to do, run? Well, you ain't asking me. You're telling me. And I don't know a thing. See? All I've got to say, Tom, is that you've got a good job now. You don't need these rats you're running with. I suppose you want me to go to night school and read poems. I've been hearing a few things myself. - There's nothing to hear about me. - That's all you know. You ain't so smart. - Books don't hide everything. - You're a liar, Tom. You're covering up. Covering up? For what? For you? Why, you're nothing but a sneak thief. - What did you say? - You heard me. A larceny sneak thief. A nickel-snatcher. Robbing the street car company. [HORNS TRUMPETING] [CHATTERING] Don't you think that booze ain't gonna be valuable. I heard today that alcohol's going to $30 a gallon. The real McCoy is hard to get. All you gotta do when you deliver a shipment is size up the layout and let me know. I can use some of it. And I know two or three others that'll buy all that I can't handle. It means real dough. A three-way split. I said we'd get together sometime, didn't I? Well, the time has come now. - Grab the rope. One jerk to start, two to stop. - Yup. [WHISTLES] Thanks, Tommy. There. Are you satisfied? I'll say. Pretty soft, wasn't it? How do you like playing with Paddy? Wouldn't know what to do with so much dough. Ah, you ain't started. I'll make big shots out of you yet. - Anything you say goes with me, Paddy. MATT: Me too. Then here's to us. - Thirty-one and a half. - Thirty-one and a half. Don't forget, plenty of room in there. Oh, sir, here's where you need the room. - Such a muscle. - Make it snappy... - ...or you're gonna find out what it's for. - Yeah. Let's get out of here. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Twenty-two and a half. - Twenty-two and a half. Did you read about that big robbery at the booze warehouse? - Forty-two and a half. ASSISTANT: Forty-two and a half. Right under their very noses. Yeah. A guy was just telling me about it. TAILOR: Thirty-three and a half. - Thirty-three and a half. Why, if those men get away with that, they'll be rich for life. - Thirty-seven and a half. ASSISTANT: Thirty-seven and a half. Did you read what it said in the papers? A hundred and fifty thousand. ASSISTANT: A hundred and fifty-thousand. - Dollars. [ASSISTANT CLEARS THROAT] Why don't you two mugs get an adding machine? All through now, gentlemen. - Thank you, thank you. - Don't forget what I told you. - Plenty of room right there. - Yeah, and remember, six buttons. ASSISTANT: Six buttons. Be careful, Matt, or you're gonna cut the nose right off you. [TAILOR CHUCKLES] Well, well, if it ain't Mr. Tom and Mr. Matt. TOM: Hello, George. How's business? - Big night. TOM: Good. [ENGINE REVVING] Say, stupe. That's got gears. That ain't no Ford! DRIVER: Okay, boss. [BAND PLAYING CHEERFUL DANCE MUSIC] Ah, Mr. Powers, Mr. Doyle. Alone as usual? I am. Matt's all fixed up. He's got me with him. Well, the night's young yet. You'll wind up with something. Yeah, with a morning paper. - A couple of light-weights. - Yeah, flat tires. Listen, why don't you send them two smack-offs home to their mothers. They're no good to the joint anymore. WAITER: And the ladies too? Don't be silly. [MUSIC STOPS] [PEOPLE CLAPPING] How about something with ice in it? Well, uh, we're with friends. Yeah, I know it. I'm one of them. Hello, baby. What are you gonna have? Anything you say, big boy. You're a swell dish. I think I'm gonna go for you. - Yeah? MATT: Hey, Tom. - Look at what I got measured for. - I don't even know you're here. [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Come on. [KITTY CHUCKLES] Then it's a deal? If you can assure me my name will be protected. Ah, you'll be protected all over the place. Hello, boys. You can take off those clothes. You got new jobs. - Yeah? PADDY: Yeah. First meet Mr. Leehman. These are the two lads I was telling you about. Sit down, boys. How do you like the brewery business? - We don't know nothing about it. - You will. - You're in it now. - Yeah? PADDY: Mr. Leehman and I have got it all fixed. You see, Mr. Leehman owns that big brewery over on Union Avenue. - But that's been closed since— - Yeah, but it's gonna open up. You spoke of a rather remarkable man from the West Side. Yeah. Nails Nathan. Paddy, is Nails throwing in with us? He'll be here any minute. Wow. I don't believe I'm acquainted with the gentleman. Then you're the only man in town that ain't. At least everybody's heard of him, eh, boys? Believe me, Mr. Leehman, when Nails Nathan and his mob start on a job... ...it's already done. If that Schemer Burns crowd tries to muscle in on us... ...I pity them. You understand, of course... ...that my desire is merely to furnish a better grade of beer... ...than the working man can now obtain under the present, uh, unfortunate— NAILS: In your hat. And again in your hat, mister. I've heard that north wind blow before. If you're in this, you're in for the coin, same as all the rest of us. - Gentlemen, meet Nails Nathan. - Born Samuel. Tom Powers. Glad to know you. - And you're Matt Doyle. - Yeah. - How are you? Sit down, fellows. - How'd you know? Know all about you. Paddy here has been talking. PADDY: Meet Mr. Leehman, Nails. - Tickled pink. Don't take offense at anything I say, Mr. Leehman. But if we're in this racket together, we've gotta keep the cheaters off. - My name is not to appear— - Don't worry. Won't use it in our advertising. Well, Paddy, the mob's all ready by the time you can open. Got some swell routes laid out for you and the stock's all marked. You mean, you have the customers all signed up? Signed up? Yes, sir. Signed up and sealed up. Tom and Matt here is the official signers and sealers. The trouble squad. Yeah, and if they need any help, Nails has got some pretty handy boys... - ...with their gloves all oiled. - Dear me, I'm afraid this means— It means they buy our beer or they don't buy any beer. [LEEHMAN CLEARS THROAT] All right, Dutch, get going. And, listen, don't take any back talk from those speakies. Just tell them, "Here's the beer you ordered." If they doubt you, call Matt and Tom. All right, Matt, Tom, get going. Hello, Steve. How's business? Business? Business is on the bum. Dutch was telling us you took two kegs of beer last trip... - ...but now you don't want any at all. - Well, business is on the bum. Well, give us a couple of beers. That'll help a little. That ain't our beer. Where'd you get this slop? Well, it's good, ain't it? And it's cheaper than yours. How much you paying for this stuff? - Two bits a glass. - All right. Screw. I thought so. You can sell ours for the same price. Keep your hands off that. Somebody's gotta protect your customers. What am I gonna do? I can't help it if I have to buy from Schemer Burns. - They tell me the same thing that you do. - Ah, you're yellow. - Aw, please, you ain't gonna slug me, are you? - Maybe not today. I'm telling you this for the last time. When Dutch comes around, he's gonna leave some beer, and you're gonna take it. And you're gonna kick in with the dough. If you don't... ...somebody's gonna kick your teeth out one at a time. Get me? Yeah, and you'll be needing some right away. How many shall we leave? - Two kegs. - You hear that, Dutch? Bring in five kegs. Mr. and Mrs. Patrick J. Ryan. Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Crogen. Welcome home, Michael Powers. Samuel Nathan? Samuel Nathan? I never heard of him. Nails Nathan, one of Tom's new friends. What's Tom doing now, Pat? - Mother said something about a political job. - Yeah, and that ain't all. He and Matt have been running around with a couple of girls at the Washington Arms Hotel. Well, now, the worst part of it all is that he's been lying to his mother. He's leaving her think that he's made an honest success. But sure, it's only a question of time when he's going to be caught. And then he'll be after, breaking her poor heart. But what's he doing? Beer, bootleg. He's one of Paddy Ryan's gang, but that's not all. Sure they stop at nothing. You either take their beer or they put you on the spot. Aw, I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week... - You got it? - Yeah, I got it. Oh. That's nice of you, Tommy. But I don't think Mike'll be able to drink any. It's the best beer in town. It'll do him good. Dinner's all ready, Michael. Shall I help you in? No, Mother. I can make it. Well, I'll be getting along. I'll see you all later. Bye-bye. How's the meat, Mikey? Fine, Ma. I wish you'd eat more. Try some of this cabbage. I've had plenty, Ma. MATT: Say, we haven't drunk to your health yet. This is a swell celebration. There you are, Mike. MATT: Enough for you, Ma. Put a head on that, will you? MATT: Mrs. Powers. Well, here's to you, Mike. Why don't you drink, Mike? Come on. It's only beer. I don't want any, Matt. What's eating you? I'm not interfering with your drinking. If you want to drink it, go on. But if I don't want to, I don't have to. So beer ain't good enough for you, huh? You think I'd care if it were just beer in that keg? I know what's in it. I know what you've been doing. How you got those clothes and those new cars. You've been telling Ma you've gone into politics. That you're on the city payroll. Pat Burke told me everything. You murderers! It's not only beer in that keg. It's beer and blood. Blood of men! [MRS. POWERS SHRIEKS] You ain't changed a bit. Besides, your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. Didn't get medals by holding hands with them Germans. Please, Tommy. He ain't himself. He don't know what he's talking about. This trip's been too much for the poor soul. Lord, have pity on him. Oh, please, Tommy. Come on, Matt. Let's get out of here before I go screwy too. MRS. POWERS: Oh, don't go away, Tommy. Don't be angry. You can send my clothes to the Washington Arms Hotel. Hey, get up, lazy bones. What are you going to do, sleep all day? - Aw, button up. I can sleep as long as I like. - Well, that's a fine way to talk to me... ...after I cooked this lovely breakfast for you with my own lily white hands. Lakeview 8515. Right. - Hello? - Hello. Is Tom there? I called his apartment. They said he stepped across the hall for breakfast. - Nails Nathan. KITTY: Oh, sir. Just a minute. Tom, it's for you. TOM: Who is it? - Nails Nathan. - Hello, kid. - Hello, Tom. What's the matter, kid? Ah, nothing. Only this dame is beginning to get on my nerves, that's all. Oh. Listen. I'm getting fed up on these rubber checks bouncing in. We're laying down good beer and getting nothing but a lot of bum paper. I got one this morning for 1200 from that Pete over on Kedzie Avenue. Get over there. I want that dough. Cash or his heart. If you can't bring in one, bring in the other. [TOM CHUCKLING] I'll bring you both. You leave it to me, kid. All right. Come on, Matt, shake a leg. Nails wants us to do him a favor. MATT: Aw, in a minute. KITTY: It's all ready, Tom. - Ain't you got a drink in the house? - Not before breakfast, dear. I didn't ask for any lip. I asked you if you had a drink. I know, Tom, but, I wish— There you go with that wishing stuff again. I wish you was a wishing well... ...so that I could tie a bucket to you and sink you. Maybe you've found someone you like better. [SOBS] [WHISTLE BLOWS] TOM: How goes it, babe? - Going south? GWEN: Yes. But I'm not accustomed to riding with, uh, strangers. We're not going to be strangers. - How far are you going? GWEN: Pretty far. Near Jackson Park. - Is that out of your way? - Oh, no. - My chauffeur's just crazy about long drives. - Say! Step on it, James. Well, do I look good to you? Sure do. I feel flattered. You know, you're not the worst I've seen either. - From Chicago? - Not exactly. I came from Texas. - Where you living? - The Congress Hotel. If you're a stranger here, Tom and me will show you the town. Stick to your driving, mug. Say, you can let me off here. I'm going to meet my friends on the corner. Okay. Could I...? Could I see you again later? I'd be happy to have you call me sometime. Uh, I mean later today. I'll think it over. Give me your phone number and I'll call you. All right, babe. Yards 3771. Yards 3771. I'll remember. And in the meantime, thanks. My name's... My name's Gwen, Gwen Allen. - Mine's Tom Powers. - Yeah and mine is Matt— He ain't got a name, just a number. Gee, she's a honey. I could go for her myself. What do you mean you could go for her yourself? You could go for an 80-year-old with rheumatism. When are you gonna see her? - She's gonna call me. - Find out if she's got a friend. What do you want with a friend? You got Mamie, ain't you? Ain't you going to kiss your little baby? Aw, nuts. Well, you've got Kitty, ain't you? Well, I ain't going to have her much longer. I'm fed up. And you can tell her so for me. Step on the gas, will you? [BAND PLAYING ELEGANT DANCE MUSIC] Mack, George, quick! Ah, Mr. Nathan. Delighted to see you, Mr. Nathan. - How are you, Joe? - Fine, thank you. - Where would you like to sit? - Where do I always sit? Right at the ringside. WAITER: It's nearly full up there. - We can fix that, sir. Mack, George, fix a table immediately at the railing for Mr. Nathan. Great. The best is none too good tonight. This is a wedding celebration. JOE: Really? - Yep. Matt's decided to take something lawful, a wife. JOE: Well... - That's something to celebrate, isn't it? - I should say so. - Meet, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Doyle. JOE: We're honored, I assure you. - Well, let's dance while they're fixing the tables. JOE: This way, please. MAN 1: How are you, Nails? MAN 2: Hello, Mr. Nathan. MAN 3: How are you, Mr. Nathan? NAILS: How are you? Making money? JOE: Right this way, please. MAN 4: Hello there, Nails. NAILS: How are you? [CHATTERING] - Are you as happy as I am, Matt? - Sure, honey. You fellows don't know what it means to a girl, getting married. Oh, well, you knew all the time I was gonna marry you, didn't you? Of course I did. I was just thinking of Tom and Kitty. Oh, well, they're different. I guess Tom ain't the marrying kind. No, I guess not. Are you sure that was old Putty Nose? - I ought to know him when I see him. - Sure you'd know him. I suppose you'd like to put in with him again. That's the fagin that put something over on you, ain't it? [LAUGHS] I had to laugh when I heard about that. That guy's gonna get you again. - He thinks you're soft. - He ain't gonna get me. We don't want any part of him. Well, I haven't got a thing to say, boys, but he's got the Indian sign on you, Tom. - He thinks you're a cinch. - In a pig's eye. That McGonagle ain't got a chance. Take care of the women, Nails. You're not going out in the cold, dark night, are you? Nails will see that you get home. We got a little job to do. - Come on, Matt. NAILS: That will be a pleasure. You're not going to leave me tonight, Matt? Well, there's something we forgot to do, honey. I'll be home later. TOM: Come on. Where's he going? Just walking around the block to cool themselves off. What are you worrying about? Sit down. PUTTY NOSE: Have her ready at 8:00, full of gas. I'm going on a long trip. Well, if it ain't Tom Powers. And Matt too. How are you, boys? - Been out of town? - Yeah, I was down home, visiting. Got a little drink for us, Putty? Why, sure, sure, Tom, but I can't let you in just now. You see, I've got a jane inside. I'll bring it right out to you. TOM: Wait a minute, Putty Nose. - We've got words for you. - What's up, Tom? We got a little business to settle, jane or no jane. You ain't sore, are you, Tom? - I've always been your friend. - Sure. You taught us how to cheat, steal and kill. And then you lammed out on us. Yeah. If it hadn't been for you, we might have been on the level. Sure, we might have been ding-dings on a street car. Come on. A jane, huh? There ain't no one here but him. I thought so. Why, you dirty double-crossing— PUTTY NOSE: Gee, Tommy. TOM: What are you squawking about? You've got plenty more coming. Gee, Tommy, Matt. What you gonna do? I don't wanna die. Oh. So you don't wanna die. Aw, Tommy, don't you remember you and Matt... ...how you used to be just kids and how we were friends? You won't let him, Matt. I'll do anything for you from now on. Ain't you got a heart, Matty boy? Don't you remember how I used to play to you and didn't I always stick up for you? I ain't got this coming. Please. Please, Matt. Matt! Don't let him. Don't. I ain't a bad fellow. Really. Oh, Tommy. Tommy, don't. Ain't you got a heart? Promise you won't let him, Matt. Will you? You remember—? You remember that song I used to sing? That song I taught you? You remember, Tommy. Heh. Back in the club? How you kids used to laugh at that song. [SINGING] Tell me, how long do I have to wait? Or can I get you now? Or must I hesitate? Lizzy Jones, big and fat Slipped on the ice and broke her— [GUNSHOTS] PUTTY NOSE: Hat. [HAMMERED PIANO NOTES] TOM: I guess I'll call up Gwen. She ought to be home by now. Oh, it's Tommy. Let me make you a cup of tea. No, I gotta be getting back on the job, Ma. My, but it's good to see you again. I was beginning to think I'd lost you. You can't lose me that easy. [MRS. POWERS LAUGHS] Poor Michael. I'm afraid he's working himself into an early grave. Days on the cars, school at night and studying in between. Listen, Ma, I come over to give you something. Here. Take this, and when you need any more, just say so. - I'm making plenty. - Oh, you're a good boy, Tommy, but I can't. - Take it. - Well, Mike wouldn't like it. - Mike ain't got nothing to say about it. MIKE: No? - I've got something to say. It's important. - Keep it to yourself. - Nobody's asking you to stick two cents in. - I don't want you two fighting. It ain't right for two brothers. Ain't gonna be fighting. Only I don't need his preaching. - What is this, Ma? - Tommy gave it to me to buy some things with. - Ain't that nice? - Don't like it? More than you can do. We don't want your money. I'm taking care of Ma. On two bits a week. - Ma don't go to nightclubs and don't drink. - How do you know? - I used to dance when I was a girl. - Listen, I ain't gonna argue... ...and I can't tell you all I'd like to in front of Ma. - Get an earful of this. You ain't welcome. - Michael. - That is blood money. We want no part of it. - Hiding behind Ma's skirts like always. Better than hiding behind a machine gun. Ah, you're too smart. - I'm going, Ma. - And don't forget your change. - Money don't mean nothing to me. - No, I guess not. But with no heart and no brains, it's all you've got. You'll need it. Why, you sneaking, stooling— Tommy. Tommy. Oh, Tommy. Oh, Michael, why did you hit him? [SOBBING] I may leave town next week. You don't care, do you? You know... ...when I first met you... ...I sort of figured you was on the make, not much. You know what I mean. And besides that, uh, I figured you was sort of different too. That is, uh, different from the kind of girls I was used to. Oh, I don't go for these long-winded things, but with me it was always yes or no. And I could never figure you out. Now can you? No. And I guess I ain't your kind. - I think we'd better call it quits. - Oh, don't be like that, Tommy. Of course I "go for you," as you say. Maybe too much. You know, uh... ...all my friends, uh, think that things are different between us than they are. - Yes? - Mm-hm. They figure they know me pretty well and they don't think I'd go for a merry-go-round. Do you think I'm giving you a merry-go-round? - Well, no, I— - Well, then... ...do you want things to be different to please your boy friends? No, but how long can a guy hold out? - I'd go screwy. - Where are you going? I'm gonna blow. You're a spoiled boy, Tommy. You want things and you're not content until you get them. Well, maybe I'm spoiled too. Maybe I feel that way too. But you're not running away from me. Come here. Now, you stay put if you know what that means. Oh, my bashful boy. You are different, Tommy. Very different. And I've discovered it isn't only a difference in manner and outward appearances. It's a difference in basic character. The men I know... ...and I've known dozens of them... ...oh, they're so nice, so polished, so considerate. Most women like that type. I guess they're afraid of the other kind. I thought I was too. But you're so strong. You don't give, you take. Oh, Tommy, I could love you to death. [DOORBELL BUZZES] TOM: Oh, nuts. MATT: Is Tom here? Tom, Nails— Nails is dead. - Who killed him? - Nobody. His horse. He was thrown off in the park, kicked in the head. You got that horse that killed Nails Nathan? You mean, Rajah? He bad animal. - Terrible, terrible. - Yeah. What's he worth? Spirited horse. I told Mr. Nathan not to ride him. What's he worth? Well, he could be bought for a thousand dollars. - You see, he's— - Never mind. - Here. - Where's he at? Stall number three. Stay where you are. [GUNSHOTS] [THUD] Right now, we ain't got a chance. Since Nails is gone, his mob has scattered. They're 10 to one against us. Look at this dump. Four pineapples tossed at us in two days. And the brewery set afire. I'm telling you, they got us on the run. - Not me. I ain't running. I ain't yellow. - Who said you was? I ain't talking about that. I'm going to need you. And you won't be no good to me when you're in the cemetery. I've gotta have a couple of days to get the boys lined up again. While I'm doing that, you're going to be where nobody knows where to find you except me. Come on, give me your guns and your money. All of it. - What are you trying to pull, Paddy? - I'm gonna keep you off the streets. Even you wouldn't be sap enough to go for a stroll without your gat. Come on. Shower down. All of it. All of it. You got a phone here, Jane? I'm going to call Gwen. No, you keep away from that phone. I'll call from outside, tell her I had to send you out of town a few days. - Yeah, and ring up Mamie, will you? - Leave it to me. This won't be for long, boys. I'll have the mob lined up again in a couple of days. - Jane, you'll see that they're comfortable, eh? - You leave that to me, Paddy. Okay. Gather around, boys. We're going to be a happy little family. I hope you got plenty of this medicine. Yards 6321. Hello? Is Schemer there? Let me fix you another drink, Tommy. You mean to say you've got any of that stuff left? Ha, ha. You haven't drank so much. Well, I can drink it as long as you can pour it. [GRINDING AND CRUNCHING OUTSIDE] It's only a coal truck. Had me going for a minute. Come on and get in the game, will you, Tom? No. I'm gonna hit the hay. [DOOR CLOSES] I thought you'd like a little nightcap, Tommy. You don't need to feel ashamed in front of me, Tommy. Here. Let me help you. - I don't need any help. - Be a good boy and sit down. I'll take your shoes off too. I want to do things for you, Tommy. You don't think I'm old, do you, Tommy? No. You like me, don't you, Tommy? Sure. What's the idea? Just a good night kiss for a fine boy. In your hat. TOM: Ah, get away from me. You're Paddy Ryan's girl. Breakfast is all ready, Tommy. I ain't hungry. Give me some coffee, will you? And make it black. You aren't sorry, are you? Sorry? Sorry for what? For last night. What do you mean? For getting drunk? Aren't you the little play actor. Wait a minute. Do you mean—? Why, you... MATT: Hey, Tom. Where you going? - Home. - But Paddy— - I don't care what Paddy said! I'm getting out of this dump. MATT: Hey, Tom, wait a minute. What happened? - Aw, nothing. I just got burned up, that's all. - What do you want to run out on me for? We're together, ain't we? Sure. [GRINDING AND CRUNCHING] [MACHINE GUN FIRING] - Yes, sir? - I, uh... I was just looking at them pistol things. - Shall I show you some? - Yeah. I kind of like that big one. - That one? - Mm. All right. - Uh, what do you call that? - That's a .38 caliber. - Oh, it's a fine— - You got any more like it? - Well, I've got some smaller ones. - No. Same size. Sure. Uh, how do you load that? First, you break it. - Then you stick the cartridges in the holes. - Could I see? Sure. - That's right. - Like that? Yes. - It'll hold six. - Oh, this'll be enough. Stick them up. Stick them up. SNITZ: Okay, Schemer, it's all fixed. [GUNFIRE] [MAN WAILING] [WAILING CONTINUES] [COUGHING] [GROANING] I ain't so tough. [WHISTLE BLOWING] - Well, Doc, what do you think? - Can't say. Well, we'll hope for the best. Doctor... ...this is Tom's mother, brother and Miss Doyle. You can go in for a few minutes, Mrs. Powers. Thank you, sir. Tommy. Tommy, boy. Do you know me? Sure, Ma. Tommy... ...Mike's here. He's come to see you. Hello, Mike. How are you, Tom, old scout? I've been wanting to see you. You're going to be seeing a lot of me, Tom. There's something... Something I wanted to say to you, Mike. I'm— I'm sorry. Sorry for what? Just sorry. You know? Oh, Tommy. You and Mike are going to be friends again. Sure. Friends. Oh, boys. I'm so happy. So happy. Ma. You must like Mike a lot better than me. No, no, Tommy, boy. You're my baby. Sure. I'm your baby. You're coming home. Ain't you, Tommy? To stay? Sure. Coming home. That is... ...if I can ever get out of here. You're going to get out of here all right, Tom. Why, of course you are. You're going to get well and strong. Both my boys back. All of us together again. I'm almost glad this happened. [MRS. POWERS HUMMING] And he really looked better today. Did he, Michael? Sure, Ma. A lot better. He was sitting up. I told him you'd be to see him tomorrow. And he'll be coming home soon, won't he? Sure, Ma. [CONTINUES HUMMING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] MIKE: Oh, Paddy, come in. What's wrong? Is—? Is Tom—? They kidnapped him from the hospital this afternoon. What? Who did? It must have been the Burns mob. First, they give it to him in the back. Then they take him when he's helpless. Who knows what they're doing to him now. - Well, they ain't going to get away with this. - I'm doing all I can. My boys are out on the street now. I'll bring Tom back if it's the last thing I do. - I'm gonna— - You're gonna stay here... ...at that phone and take messages. I told my boys to call you up if they find anything. - Oh, I'd like to smash— - Listen. I sent word to Burns that if he'd bring Tom back here tonight, I'd— I'd quit the racket. He could have it all. And I'd leave town and I won't come back. Do you think they'll do it? It's a sweet offer. You stay here. If you hear anything from any one of my boys... ...call me at my place. I've gotta get back on the job. [PLAYING SOFT MUSIC] Don't you like your dinner? Why, I just ain't hungry, Ma. [PHONE RINGS] I'll get it, Ma. Yeah? This is Mike. When? You are? Fine. Ma, they're bringing Tom home. - They are? When? - Right now. He's on his way. Is—? Is he all right? Must be or they wouldn't be bringing him home. Oh, it's wonderful. I'll get his room ready. I knew my baby would come home. - Who called, Mike? - One of Paddy's boys, I guess. Didn't say who. MRS. POWERS: Molly. Molly, dear. MOLLY: Yes, Mother. MRS. POWERS: Bring up some clean sheets out of the linen closet. - Hurry, dear. MOLLY: All right. [HUMMING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [CAR WITHDRAWS] [HUMMING] Ooh. [CONTINUES HUMMING]
