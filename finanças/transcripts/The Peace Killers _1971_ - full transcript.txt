Hey, whitey, wake up. Whoa! Let's go have some fun. = now hear this. Now hear this. All right, let's get ready, guys, we're gonna dump this cop. Hey, Ben, how are you? Good to see you again. Aren't you going to come inside, kristy? Well? Well, just because I'm your sister, you don't have to forget your manners. Okay, we'll do it your way. Jeffrey! Jeffrey, put me down. Jeffrey! Put me down. Jeffrey. I'll break every bone in your, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, put me down this minute. Hey, Ben, what can you do with this? I don't know. What can she do? Jeffrey. I don't know. Hey, kristy, what can you do? = you started it. I'll order it for you, kristy. It'll be here, next time you come in. That about it? Yeah, I think so, Ben. Well, let's see here now. I didn't expect you two back for at least another week. Well, we just couldn't stand to be away from you for that long, Ben. You mean, with 20 of you running around that commoon, or commune or whatever it is you call it. You and your sister had to drive for an hour down here just to see me? I don't believe it. If you're gonna be like that, we're gonna leave. I don't know how you kids find the time with all those orgies and whatever else it is you have up there. Come on. = I can't leave the store. What are you doing now? Don't you want to go to the orgy with us? Yeah, come on, Ben. Why don't you close up for lunch and come on and eat with us? Nothing like a good orgy to hold you over till dinner. What the, where's some gas? Sounds like I've got some customers. Okay, I think I've got some more belts in the bus. Hey, they got state troopers like that in Texas? That was funny! That smoke bomb was something else. Ben! Ben, take kristy out the back way. Why? What's wrong, Jeff? I'll pick you up at the side door. = Jeff. = get out of here! Would you take her out, please? Jeff, what's the matter? Come on, get out of here, quick. Hey, anybody in there? Hey, hi-ho hippie away. Hey, come on, what did you stop for? Come on, kristy, let's go! Asshole! Guess they should have given you time to saddle up, eh, cowboy? Shit, man, I just fell off the back of some damn bus. I didn't get pushed out of nobody's hot-seated bed by some freaky chick. What are you rapping about, man? Are you stoned? No, man, I ain't stoned. But, reb's gonna wish to hell he was when we tell him. Hey, tell us, cowboy, what exactly is it we are proposing to tell our leader? Kristy! Flash, right? Kristy was right here. Reb's gonna break you into little pieces, man, if you're putting him on. Well, let's go get her. Bring her back to him, all nice and ready to get screwed. Well, let's get, get it on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Why don't we ask the proprietor of this store if he knows where she can be located. Well, then we can throw our long lost friend a kind of surprise party? You're always thinking, gadget, always thinking. We don't mean to bother you none, old man. Could you please tell us where the people in that bus went to? Don't know 'em, really. Never saw 'em before. Come on, I think you do. Tell me where kristy went, old man. Come on, or your never gonna take a good swallow again, god damn it! If you're lying to me, old man, you're gonna damn well wish I'd have killed you. = tits! I love 'em. The little ones that sort of whisper, catch me, catch me! And big boppers that kind of yell at you, you know, show me something new! Oh, mother, do I love 'em! What's closer to a tit than a bra, right? Each one like fingerprints. Individual identification. This one here, she was only about five foot high. Oh, but what a body she had, man. Wow! She just wouldn't quit. = where's reb? Find any bras? God damn it, where'd reb go? He's over there. Hey, reb. Hey, reb. You took your sweet-ass time getting back, cowboy. Reb, we saw kristy. Kristy? Really, reb, I swear I saw her. Where? At that funky old gas station, a few miles this side of the saddle peak bar. = where is she now? Where is she now? - We don't know. We'll go find her. Okay, reb? I'll go find her right now. = no! I'll go find her. I'll find that little whore. Snatch! Yeah. I just might get you and these other clowns laid tonight. You other guys weren't around here during kristy time. You wait here for us till we get back. We ain't back by tonight, go on in to Tucson. We'll meet you there. All right, let's get the hell out of here. Cowboy, you better not be shitting me. Hey, nothing's gonna happen to you. They're probably miles away by now, guzzling beer and getting stoned. = you don't understand! You don't know what they do. They're not gonna do anything. I was rebel's old lady. I lived with them, I know them. There are things I saw that just won't go away. Whitey's girl left him. She split. But they got her back. And then, I was standing there watching. Two of them held her down, while the others stood in a line, and one by one they raped the insides out of her. She was crying and screaming. And the more she screamed, the more they laughed. I stood there. I just stood there, drinking my goddamn beer. The night I told him I was splitting he went crazy. He kept yelling, "if you ever take off, I'll kill you. "I'll find you and kill you, you fucking whore." Jeff, what am I gonna do? Why don't you just talk to Alex. Tell him the whole thing. He'll know what to do. Yeah. You go home. I'm gonna go down by the lake. They'll still be there, I'll find them. Okay. = I wanna see Alex now. Yell at the top of our voice. Or not say a word. Cover our bodies with clothing, cover them with sunlight. We're totally free from all of the external boundaries that man sets up between himself and his world. Yet even here, among all of this freedom, inside of each one of us is a prisoner, trapped there alone with his feelings, stifled. Unable to convey what his true thoughts or his true self. Speech is really such a poor means of communication. Words distort just so much. All of us, we've all been taught to seek the love of one person. One person who can know what we are. I mean, beyond speech, without words. Somebody who can just, just feel our touch and know. Love is sometimes spoken of as the act of two bodies joining, becoming part of each other. Becoming one for a moment of time and space, that's beautiful. Right here, now, we're all equal and we're as one, And we will experience together an implosion deep within ourselves. And then an explosion of all of our senses. But should we limit our oneness to a moment during a time of loving? Should we limit our time of loving to the moment of sex? J he's the devil's tool and he thinks he's cool jÂ» j nobody better get in his way j j many a reason for moving on j j but he's got no reason to stay j j blood dripping from his hands j makes him feel like he's a man j j he's mean and evil j j yes, he's so bad j j he's been riding in the sun way too long j and I do believe it's driven him quite mad J nothing to win but lust and sin j j and he's living on dust and speed j the only time he loves a woman j j is when he feels a need j j blood dripping from his hands j makes him feel like he's a man j j he's mean and evil j j yes, he's so bad j j he's been riding in the sun way too long j and I do believe it's driven him quite mad J blood dripping from his hands j makes him feel like he's a man j j he's mean and evil j j yes, he's so bad j j he's been riding in the sun way too long j and I do believe it's driven him quite mad Come on out, old man. You mother, you could have killed me. Gadget, get the phone lines. Now, if you don't tell me where kristy is, I swear I'll kill you. You're gonna tell me now, ain't you? If you can't talk, maybe you'd like to write me a letter. Where is she, you bastard? Gadget, give me a flare. Where is she, old man? You wanna burn up, you old fool? Huh? You wanna feel your lousy skin burning off? Okay, god damn it, burn. Alex. Alex! What? Can we talk? Are you nearly finished? Well, sure. I can finish later. It was beautiful at the lake this morning, wasn't it? Yeah, it was good. I didn't want to spoil it. So, I waited till now to talk. Alex, I have to tell you something. What's the matter, kristy? We've never talked much about what happened to me before I came here. Before I met you. Kristy, that's the past. Look, that part of your life's all over now. Here, we try to live in the now. Yes, I know. Do you wanna talk about what happened before? No, I don't even want to think about it. But, I have to now, Alex. Alex, I saw somebody today, down at Ben's store. Oh! Hold me, Alex. Hold me, hold me, hold me. I'm so scared. It's okay, it's okay. Tell me about it. But Alex, there is a chance the bike gang will come here to look for kristy. And if they do... And if they do, we won't let them hurt her. They may try. But, if we confront them together peacefully, we can prevent it. And above all none of us should plug into their way, into their violence. Look, we have a chance to act on all those things we've only talked about before. What if they start a fight? Yeah, what are we supposed to do, let them wipe us out or something? I'm sure that they're not savages. We can reason with them. My god, when they see the changes that Kristen's gone through, they're gonna know that she belongs here, and they're gonna leave. I can't really make the decisions for you. Each one of us can only do what he feels to be right. Okay, let's think about it for a while, okay? What is it, Jeff? I don't know, I just, I just don't think he's right. I wanna believe him, but I just can't. No, kristy, you'll only make it worse. But... Go. Go hide in the barn. = Jeff. If they think you're not here they may leave. Now, go on, get out of here. If you have to, saddle mandrake and ride up to the snake canyon. Okay? Go on. Shut up! Where's kristy? I sent her away. Well, man, you better tell me where she is. I think you better leave now. I think you better shut up! Look, dummy, you're pissing me off. She's my old lady and I'm gonna have her. Gadget, get your toy gun and let's see if these little children like to play games. Now, den mother, you could have made it so easy. One way or another, I'm gonna find that little whore. And when I do I'm gonna give her a special midnight ride, just for you. And when she's kicking and screaming and trying to get her little legs back together, I'm just gonna ram into her and tear her wide open, just for you. Gadget, you and your little friend stay here and make these nice people happy. We'll go out and take a look around. See if we can find what they did with my old lady. Then we'll all get us laid tonight. Right behind you, Jack. = nice tits! Don't hurt her, man. I'd like to see what I'm getting, so I'm sure you wouldn't mind undressing, would you? = go to hell. You might not wanna undress for me, but I'm sure you'd ball a buffalo for him. = fuck off! You phony little runt. I'm warning you. Now don't push me too far. Wouldn't it mean more to you if she were to undress because she wanted to? No, I want her to undress because I want her to. And the less she feels like it, the better the conquest, now don't you agree? Well, it really doesn't matter now does it? Because if she doesn't cooperate, you won't be around to agree to the price of your funeral. All right, all right. Look, look at it! You wouldn't know what to do with it anyway! = Jeff! What'd you have to stop me for? I'm sorry, Jeff. I'm sorry. Listen, we can't let ourselves be like them. Well, I guess old gadget got a little carried away. Okay, den mother, we played hide and seek long enough. It's a fun game though, ain't it? Only we play it a little different. See we ain't got the time to crawl into all your little hiding places so we just ask around real nicely. Until somebody can't stand to see her suffer anymore. And tells us where she is because they love her so much. Damn it, we don't know where Kristen is. Will you let her go? Somebody better know where she is! You! Hey. Let me help the poor boy. = don't touch him. Did you hear that? Well what are you gonna do, den mother? Stick me with one of your knitting needles, huh? Cowboy! Show us what you learned in the girl scouts. Where's your peace shit getting you now? Huh? You goddamn hippie. You people make me puke! You ain't peaceful. You're just yellow. Come on, den mother, let's go. Come on. I'll take you out and string your ass up. Alex. Now, if you don't tell me where my old lady is, I swear, you ain't never getting down off there, my man. I feel like I ought to be down on my knees praying. Maybe gadget's got a hammer and some nails we can borrow. I don't believe you, man. Reb! Kristy. Come on! = motherfucker. My god. Please don't. Kristy, I ain't done nothing yet. Don't you like to be undressed this way anymore, slow and easy, huh? Pays to advertise, don't it? Any of you boys want a piece? You don't have to hang out any sign for us, honey. Just show us your tits. Don't, reb. = oh, yeah. Peace and love, baby. This one's peace, this one's love. A feisty little bitch, aren't you? Hey, wait, I got her, I got her. What do you think, baby? Huh? Boys getting all hot and bothered waiting to get into you and the way their actions been going lately, they're gonna have a whole lot to give you. I'm sure you boys won't mind if I get mine first. But, I can wait a little longer. If we start now it could all be over in a couple hours, and I wanna give you plenty of time to think about it. 'Cause that's how much I hate you, you little whore. Think about it, babe. Gadget, snatch, why don't you open your eyes and take a look at what you're gonna get, because when we're done teaching you the law, you ain't never gonna be able to look at another one again without freaking out. Acid, baby, acid. Do it, open your mouth. Gadget just gave me something that I'm gonna give to you. Somethin' that's gonna make you remember everything that happens to you tonight for a long, long time! That's it, baby. But, first you're gonna trip with death row. Shitty cops. You know, I called them. You know what they said? What? "We don't give a goddamn about you long-haired freaks. "If you wipe each other out "you'd be doing everybody a favor." Shit! Where is she? = couldn't find her. They got her? Well, maybe she got away, Jeff. Remember, she has a horse, we're on foot. Oh, listen, Carol, did you call the police? Yeah, and the fire department. They couldn't care less. Come on, let's go inside. Hey, we got to do something. Guys, there must be something we can do. Kristen will be okay, Jeff. She'll be okay. She better be, or I'm gonna kill every one of them. Every goddamn one of them. She'll be okay, Jeff. And look, don't play their game. Well, I can't. As long as you're the referee, I have to lose, don't I? We gotta find, kristy. You want some help? No, I got to do this by myself. Let's get it on! Hey, dummies! You horny bastards wanna have anything to play with when you get out of here tonight? Yeah, well, you see, we got ourselves something to play with. Well, you better hide her so nobody can find her. When I get stoned, man, I don't know if I can remember where I am, much less where I put her. Yeah, well, make sure she doesn't make too much noise while we're gone. Howdy! I got a blowtorch. Light it. Well, come on, come on, come on, squeeze it. Yeah, yeah. Come on, gadget, come on. You can bend a nice, hard boob, can't you? Come on, come on. That's my leg. What about you, whitey? I'm belly up. All right, I fell down. But, I didn't go into the water like you. = far out! You know what we found ourselves? A real live member of death row, all tied up and left here just for us. Please. Please, you got a help me. Right, and why do we have to do that? Kristy, what are you... Meeko, you got to help. Man, we don't got to or have to anything. Shit. Me help reb's old lady, shit! Meeko, reb's inside the bar. They found me and you know what they're gonna do to me. Hey, come on, man, take it or leave it, but let's split. Meeko, get your ass over here. You hear me, girl. Get on! You can't just leave her laying there. Her white, devil old man, gave me this and it took three of his pig-eyed, chicken-shit bastards to hold me down while he did it to me. And she's damn lucky that I don't run right over her face and leave her laying there permanently. Well, if you leave her laying there, rebel's gonna have a good time with her. I got to get back at that bastard. And this might as well be a start. Hey, black widow, we got to meet the rest of the gang soon, don't we? Yeah, we got to meet and beat and eat somebody a lot sooner than that, brother. Okay. Right on, brother, right on. Kristy says rebel's right around the corner getting drunk. Going in now? No way! When I get the bastard, he's gonna be stone-cold sober. No excuses, no advantages, just him and me. I hope you can do it good and fast. 'Cause, I don't want to wait too much longer. I hope you could. Well, why don't you go out and check on our little piece of ass, and make sure that she's cozy, huh? Dummy. You better hurry back, too. Gotta get it up! Do it all by yourself. Reb, she ain't there. Somebody fractured the wheels. = shit! Your bike's okay. Shut up! Dummies! Cowboy, get stink and curly and get me some new rubber. Come on, get the hell out of here. Why, I should have tied this bitch up myself. Thank god you're still a lousy driver. Hey, what happened to your arm? Nothing, it's okay. Man, what are we doing here? Yeah, we brought the little girl back. So we're going after rebel, let's split. Well, are we going or are we staying? We're staying. I want to thank you. Don't thank me for nothing yet, honey. 'Cause you's the bulls-eye here and this place of yours is the target. What do you mean? I mean, that pretty soon now a bunch of hopped-up faggots are gonna come riding in here and take back their property. This time they're not gonna find her. Well, then they're just gonna take somebody else. What are we gonna do if they do come back? Stand. We're gonna talk to them. We're gonna try to reason... Man, you are crazy. You can't talk to no mad dog. Either turn your ass and run, or step aside and kick it in the ass as it runs by you. Human beings aren't mad dogs. Rebel ain't human, brother. Look, everybody wants to be peaceful inside, everybody. But all it takes is just something to try to bring it out in them. Yeah, I'd like to see you preaching peace, while rebel is sticking a blade in your gut. Maybe I was wrong, maybe we shouldn't wait around and wait for those punks to show. Hey, we want you to stay. We won't just sit around and let you do all the fighting. What do you intend to do? I don't know, but if those bastards show up here again... They will. Then I'm gonna kill every one of them. No, Jeff. Kristy, it's about time somebody did something. Jeff, I think you better stop it... Damn it, Alex. If you want to sing a song when they come, okay. But, don't tell me what I'm gonna do. Please, Jeff, don't. I'm not gonna let that bastard even look at you again. You've got the right idea, boy, but one kid with one arm ain't gonna do a whole hell of a lot. Is anybody else gonna do anything? Come on. Yeah! Yeah, okay, good. I got a lot of things I wanna do. Us, too. Look, we can't change to their way of life. Jeff, we can't. I'm not gonna change, Alex. When it's over it'll be over. We got to put our way aside for now. If you put it aside once, then you're gonna put it aside again, and it's gonna be a lot easier the next time. Alex, when it's time to take care of business, you got to do what your gut tells you to do. Well, let's get our shit together, brother, because we better have a plan. Okay. Yeah. Well, now, they're not gonna wait around for us to get ready, so let's get it on. Yeah, let's go! What do you want us to do? Where's the rope? I got some stuff in my Van.

We'll see him. What are you gonna do now? I don't know. Are you gonna start the commune again? I haven't thought about it. Can I come with you? Yes. I want you to. This is all in the past now, Alex.
