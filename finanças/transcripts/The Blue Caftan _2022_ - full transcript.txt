Halim! Can you do the randa too? Yes, very well. And the braid? Also. Are you quick? I work fast. You'll see. THE BLUE CAFTAN This pink satin is beautiful, too. And lightweight. We can make something modern out of it. - Look. Do you like this? - No, I don't. Really? The color is soft, the fabric fluid. It suits you. Otherwise, Bachir has some new fabrics. If you find something you like, we can sew it for you. Okay, we'll go see. Has Halim started work on my caftan? Not yet, he was very busy. But he'll begin soon. Are you okay, Mina? Yes, thanks. Alright, we'll come back. See you soon. I'm going home. - I'll go with you. - No, you work. We're behind, customers are complaining. Youssef, put away the fabrics, please. - Fold them so they don't wrinkle. - Of course. See you tonight. We're low on gold thread. Is it sold around here? Yes, not far. I'll go buy some tomorrow, if you want. Okay. Who taught you the trade? My father. He was a maalem. This store belonged to him. He must have been proud of you. Mina? Mina! I’m here. Are you alright? Yes, better. Thanks. You don’t want to get some rest? No, I'm fine. You can weigh them. One or two more. No. These. One kilo. Six dirhams. - Here you are. - Thank you. I'll pay tomorrow. - If they are good! - Sure. - Been waiting long? - About an hour. But it's fine. - Can I change up here? - Yes, over there. Can you get me thread to go with this fabric? The customer will stop by to choose. Sure. Next time, change at home. - Sorry, I thought... - Come on! We’ve no time to waste. Halim! It’s beautiful. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. Here, this is the work I want done. I'm sorry, Fatna. But this work is no longer done. What do you mean? You've had this a long time, no? Yes, fifty years. I got it as a gift at the birth of my eldest. I knew a maalem who learned with the Jews. He knew how to do this work. But he died. May he rest in peace. But there must be others? No, unfortunately. There are none left. Will you let me keep it until tomorrow? - No, no need... - You’ll get it back well-ironed. And I'll fix this hem so it won't get more damaged. - Well, all right. - All right. Fig-shaped buttons... No one knows how to make these anymore. Look at the detail of the stitches, the perfection of the bows. Fifty years, it's still the same. Still as beautiful... as the first day. It is gorgeous. Can I have a look? If you’d like. What about this one? This one will never go out of style. You can have it made with silk thread in these two colors. It will look great. Do you have anything else? Let me see... Here you are. It's beautiful. Yes, it’s stunning. But it must take time to make. - A bit. - How long, more or less? About six weeks. Two months, if you want it all the way down. Two months is too long. And with a sewing machine? - Halim doesn't use sewing machines. - Oh, well. No one can tell the difference between hand-made and machine-made. Now it's the same thing. We can give you a good price. Youssef. Come. When cutting, align the fabric and hold it tight. It must not move. See? Come over here. For the collar, you always have to make a smaller pattern. Go ahead. You do the collar. - I've never done it before. - Go ahead. When you cut the fabric, leave yourself some leeway. If you cut too much, there's no going back. And always leave yourself an extra centimeter. That's your margin. The maalem’s centimeter. Next time, you'll do the pattern too. Prepare the gold thread, I'll need it. Meftal or tersan? Tersan, with three threads. Balance the tersan with the meftal. Otherwise it will deform the outfit. Iron all you like, it won't fall right. And like this? No, there's a direction you must sew in. Sorry. I lost track of the time. That's okay. You had work to do. Come, I'll heat up the dinner. You don’t want to eat? I ate some tangerines. I'm not hungry. Making progress? Is he good? Yeah. Quite good. He seems to like the craft. He wants to learn. No one wants to learn the craft anymore, Halim. It’s all over. You’ll see. Soon, he’ll tell you he’s found another job. He’ll become a deliveryman or a vegetable seller at the market. I don't know. He seems different. No, he’s not. He’s just like the previous ones. In that case, we'll find someone else. It's fine. As if apprentices grew on trees. I can manage on my own. I don't need anyone. You know that's impossible. We're too far behind. Here. Thanks. Did you lock the front door? Yes. I'd like to work more on this caftan tonight. It's missing some grommets. Let me see. You didn't tell me anything. - You could've worked the thread later. - It's all right. Rub them with almond oil. They’ll get better. And leave the caftan. You'll work on it tomorrow. Youssef! Come. Youssef! Yes? Where is the pink satin? Over there. No, it's not. - I haven’t seen it. - Over there or you haven't see it? Make up your mind. I didn’t touch it. You put the fabrics away. - Yes, but I... - Yes, but nothing! Find it or I’ll deduct it from your salary. You may as well deduct it then. You don’t care? Strange, if you did nothing wrong. You know, Ma’am, I've gotten by on my own since I was 8. Money comes and goes. It doesn't matter. I don't care. I'm not a thief. I know. It's pretty. This gold thread looks good. Good workmanship. But you should speed up. - It's just that... - Patience. - This kind of embroidery isn't simple. - That's what I’m paying for. You’re not obliged to have it done here. My husband is a maalem, not a machine. And he works at his own pace. If it does not suit you, I will refund your deposit right away. What shall we do? - I'll come check on your progress. - As you wish. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'll work faster. No. That woman doesn't dictate your pace. But we need to advance. Yes, I know. But this is the most beautiful outfit you've made in years. "That's what I'm paying for!" Stupid cow... Your husband pays with all his bribe money. To hell with her! Who does she think she is? "You don't know how many teas, coffees, cigarettes, "it takes to make this caftan, Madam the district chief's wife!" "Yes! There you go! Less mint tea and more work!" "My husband is a maalem, not a machine!" "He works at his own pace. If you don't like it, I'll refund you." "Hear me? Right away!" "I'll tell my husband Abdellatif. He won't be happy." "Your husband?" "Abdellatif?" "Yes, my husband! My husband, the district chief!" "Who knows everyone!" District Chief! Chief, sure! Where are you going? I don't feel like going home now. But you have to rest, Mina. - We're going to Moha's. - Moha? Yes, Moha. I walked past that café for 15 years, never set foot inside. So what? So nothing, I want a mint tea from Moha's. That's all. There’s a chair. Hello Halim, what can I get you? Tea with saffron. I like to mix them. And you, my darling? Coffee. I'll have coffee. I'd like to smoke a little too. - You're kidding, right? - No. - Take that ball off him! - Look out! Don’t let him through! Goal! God damn it! What's her problem? We have to score now. What? It was a goal. As if it were the World Cup final, right? It’s crazy. I don’t get them. Really. I swear. Good evening. Good evening. Identification. - Is there a problem, officer? - Just a routine check. Since when do you do routine checks in the medina? Your ID. I don't carry it only a few steps from my house. - Then we go to the station. - She's my wife, we live a block away. All right. Your marriage certificate? Sorry, officer, I don't have it on me. I can go home and get it, if you’d like. Okay for this time. You, come over here. Why do you apologize? I don't get it. What do you want me to do? What I want you to do? Yes. What? Nothing. One should never do anything, never say anything. Mina! Mina! Tomorrow morning, we go to the hospital. You need to get new tests. It's useless and you know it. No. We will go. What for? To pay 4000 dirhams again for another scan? Don't you think we've spent enough already? We did everything we could. Now it's all in God's hands. I've improved my embroidery from last time. I'm almost there. Good, you'll show me. Hello. Anybody here? Nobody? - Hello, Ma’am. - Is Mina here? No, she's not. May I help you? I'd like a caftan for a wedding. Got anything good? Hold on, I'll call the maalem. I can adjust them for width or length. It's not what I'm looking for. I need something more chic. Very classy. This one. It's a classical cut. It's worked all the way down and on the sides. I find it heavy. What about that one? When will it be ready? I'm sorry, it’s reserved for a customer. May I see it? Just see it. The work is flawless, I must say. Careful, you mustn't be rough on the fabric. Listen, I'm willing to pay you more than her. You set the price. I'm sorry. That's not possible. Can you get me the same royal blue? This is not royal blue. It's petroleum blue. Forget it. Goodbye. As if you were the only one on the market... How did it go today? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up. Do you think I'm a chicken? I just closed my eyes a moment, I wasn't going to sleep. Feeling better? Yes, thank God. I'll make you dinner. I'm not hungry. Rest. Here. Let me see. It's not bad. The symmetry is not good. Keep referring to the other side, so it's identical. Don't keep your eyes fixed on your fingers. Put the needle in well, press it firmly, so the stitch will hold. A caftan must be able to survive the one who wears it. Be passed from mother to daughter. Stand the test of time. Go on, continue. Press firmly when you put the needle in. You’re feeling well? Yes, better. Thank God. Did you rest? Yes, and I also tidied up the house. You look beautiful. As always. You're home a little late. You couldn't finish earlier? No. Let me set the table. Go make yourself comfortable. You must be tired. It's almost ready. Is it good? Yes, very. What's the occasion? No occasion. Do we always need an occasion to eat rfissa? You’re right. You went out grocery shopping? Yes. So what? You shouldn't go out alone, Mina. I feel fine. Tomorrow I'll be at the store. What? You rather I stay stuck in bed all day? Eat. It’s going to get cold. Halim! Coming. Like this? Yes, that's better. But a little tighter. I can cinch it a little more. But this fabric should glide over your skin. Not squeeze it. It's silk velvet. See how soft it is. How it glides... You mustn't hinder its movement. If you wear it directly on your skin, it will envelop it naturally. The corded belt will do the rest. I see. But take it in a little. All right. As you wish. You're right. That's good. Make the adjustments when you finish the other caftan. Did I do something wrong? No. We just need to speed up. Show me the others. This one is gorgeous. And have a look at this one. Look. Women adore this one. I don't know. Mina, you can return those you don't like. Okay. By the way... You paid for this pink satin last time, and returned it by mistake. You remember? Yes, thank you. I'll leave these with you. Think it over, keep what you want, give me back the rest. - Fine. - See you soon. - Hello. - Hello. Two dirhams of black soap. Just soap, nothing else? No, thanks. I’ll take an individual cabin. Fifteen dirhams. You haven't touched your plate. You’re going to tell me that at every meal? You haven’t eaten anything for days. I'm on a diet. Catwalk model, can't you see? I'm staying home. I'm not feeling very well today. - Then I'll stay with you. - No. I'll give him a spare key and come back. No. I’d rather stay. And I'd rather you leave. You must finish that caftan. Is that good? Not too wide? Tighten it a little. A little more. Ilyas, easy on your brother! For heaven's sake! What do you think you’re doing? What's all this? Didn’t we talk about this? Come over here! For heaven's sake! Isn't that enough nonsense? You find this funny? You just wait until we get home. Shut up. Move it! You’ve got nothing to be proud of! We'll settle this at home! I'll be back tomorrow. Come on! I love you. Pick up the thread on the floor, please. Find someone else to pick up your thread. They’ve got five levels, as you asked. Two hundred buttons. And I added ten more, just in case. Good. Thanks. May God repay you. What's wrong? What's wrong? Where does it hurt? Mina. Where does it hurt? Tell me. Breathe in. Breathe out. I will increase the morphine dosage to ease the pain. And give her a syrup, to stimulate her appetite. She must eat. It's important. And nothing else? That's all we can do. But we need to go back to the hospital, run some tests. Maybe she can start another treatment. Halim. Your wife has battled. Now the time has come to let her go. I am sorry. Let's go inside. Why? It's Sheikha Hadda's funeral. Really? Doesn’t look like it. Why not? She who made all Salé dance, who loved colors and glitter... I'm sure she dreamed of something else. Can you help me wash my hair? I’ll have waited 25 years for you to wash my hair. All you had to do was ask. Be careful what you say. Who knows what else I might ask you for. Your wish is my command, Madam. How is the water? - Hot! - Hot? Hot. And like this? Like this. The store has been closed for a week. I was worried. Come in. I thought you'd have gone back to Meknes. No. Can I do anything for you? No. Halim! Who is it? It's just Youssef. He came to tell me how it's going at the store. But he's about to leave. Youssef! Do you lock up every night? Yes. Always, Mina. And Latifa? Has she come to pay for her outfit yet? No, not yet. Don't give it to her until she pays. Even if she insists. Otherwise she'll take a year to come pay. Okay. Well, I must go to the store. There's work to catch up on. I'm low on thread. I can go buy some, if you like. And pick up the buttons for the flowery outfit. There's money in the drawer, under the counter. Yes. He's managing well. He's making progress on several outfits. The customers ask, but he knows how to stall. You must go back as soon as possible. We can't afford to lose customers. All right. When you're better. Mina? It's nothing. I just wanted to grab my medicine. Why didn't you call me? I can do things myself. Are you hurt? No. Everything’s okay. I'm going to rest a bit. She came by twice last week. And again this week. She wants a refund. I thought you might want to finish it at home. It's an expensive caftan. Come in. I bought you some groceries. Just in case. There are tangerines for Mina. Thank you. She’s not better? She's a strong woman. She'll be all right. My mother died giving birth to me. My father always despised me. Mina... Mina erased everything. She was always there. Like a rock. Come on, maalem, get up. Get up! You've become lazy. Seriously? - Me, lazy? - Yes, lazy. And very much so. Yes. These. Prepare them and bring them to me. Okay. Will you need anything else? No, thank you. Halim! Is that Youssef with you? Yes. Can you send him in? He's on his way. What? You want a picture? Come. Have a seat. Thank you for everything you do. It's nothing. I found the pink satin. And I didn't tell you. I know. Since when do you know? Bachir told me... he gave it to you a few days later. Forgive me. That's all right. No. I wasn't honest with you. Will you forgive me? Look at me. I'm going to the store. I'm done. I hope it's not overcooked. Didn't he tell you I'm allergic to eggs? I'm sorry, I didn't know. Relax! If I was, I'd be dead by now. That’s all I’ve been eating for weeks. Enjoy your meal. I have work, I'm not hungry. No. - Come sit with us. - No need. It’s non-negotiable. Sit down. Here. Thanks. Know what Houria said to him? No. That your measurements were wrong. And she’s put on ten kilos! Know what he did? I told her it needed a modern touch, to suit her style. I took off the sleeves, added the fabric to the sides and squeezed her into it. Next time we'll have to weigh her before we start. Good idea. She's done this before. Hey Mohamed, turn down that damn music! You're driving us mad! Enough is enough! I’m speaking to you! Are you deaf? Sick of this! Just what we needed. God Almighty. Come. Come on! It’s all in the shoulders. Move them. Show me what you can do! Come on, come! Gaa gaa, ya Zoubida... I never heard you sing in Rifian. Well, now you’re hearing me. You don’t feel like sleeping? Yes, but I have to finish this caftan. He's a good guy. I'm sorry, Mina. I tried to suppress it. All my life, I tried. I didn’t succeed. I could have brought shame upon you. Soiled you. I don't know any man as pure as you. As noble. And I'm proud to have been your wife. It's stunning. You have to go over all the details. Make sure everything holds in place. Re-work the braid in certain places. Then, you can deliver it. It's beautiful. If we could have celebrated our wedding, I'd have wanted the same one. Even if back then you weren't as good. You know that I proposed to him? Really? Really. You smell like a camel, both of you. Today, you’re going to the hammam. It’s decided. You'll give me a break as well. - That's not possible, Mina. - Don’t make me repeat myself. Thank you, gentlemen. From now on, I can manage on my own. Why don't you go fly a kite? Beat it! Can you help me? Halim... Don't be afraid to love. Shall I get it ready it for delivery? Not yet. Close your eyes. Can you smell the sea breeze? So good... They're sweet, right? Very. My condolences. May God give you courage. Thank you. She’s ready. She has been purified. You must no longer touch her. Don't touch her shroud! Get out. Don’t you listen? I said, get out! May God preserve us. O Allah! Grant her a noble dwelling Make of her grave a garden in Paradise Cleanse her of her sins As one cleanses white fabric of dirt Wash her with water, snow, and hail...
