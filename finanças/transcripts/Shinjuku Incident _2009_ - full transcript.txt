One is the head of togawa-gumi the other is the head of sanwa-Kai, muranishi Ok, I'll do it but you have to agree to all my terms firstly you need to get me legal status in Japan then, you'll give me the Taiwan gang's territories! We not only have the same tastes we also work the same way Togawa-gumi is crazy! We can't sit around and do nothing! I'm going to kill you! Maruyama is dead! Attack with full force! Gol Recent attacks in shinjuku... Have been classified critical ordinary citizens are in danger Togawal To prevent things from going out of control the area commanders will take control organised crime division eguchi toshinari, head of the eguchi clan his follower nakajima hiromasa and the late muranishi koichi... Were close.. That guy Tanaka... isn't he a political bigwig? What are they doing? Black gold politics has existed forever don't be naive gangs, yakuza, showbiz you can't separate one from the other these days it's called capitalism The dead have no more value but the riches in this world still do vengeance must be resolved in-fighting must cease eguchi... I1s hereby appointed head of sanwa-Kai togawa taro is dead kyohel is togawa taro's heir he'll handle the same territories I've asked two friends to be withesses any opposition? Tanaka-San is elderly don't give him cause for worry you'll follow his orders, right? We will watch over you you catch my drift? Kitano-San, they're coming over Why is he beside eguchi? Kabuki-Cho's merchant list give shinjuku territories to steelhead boss, that's not right how can I explain it to our men? The Chinese cannot be trusted! He saved my life what's wrong with giving gao's territory to him? Letting the Chinese control the Chinese might work more importantly he will draw togawa arrows like a bullseye but, boss... Enough, just do as I say I can't go against the boss' orders but I want you to know I, nakajima hiromasa, despise you people! Brothers, onward to shinjuku! May wealth pour in Brother steelhead, congratulations we old immigrants will count on you from now come..come..come... Let's have a drink, thanks...

When my brothers do business in kabuki-Cho running a noodle shop or Chinese restaurant they will still need your help then... What happens when there's trouble? What trouble? There are lots of drunken louts here can't you call the cops? No, they're always gang members our licenses will be affected if there's trouble true? Right? Brother, kabuki-Cho lives by one law in the day and another by night if you don't take this money it will incite more fights when others find out I'll take it for now we'll treat it as a loan when I make a profit, I will return it no... no need to return you have your work cut out for you for instance, improve the safety here and don't let the young ones sell drugs thank you, big brother thank you... we'll take our leave see you...

Steelhead we wouldn't be here without you what are you saying! Don't fight, let's drink to steelhead! Steelhead, to you! We have achieved some results today but we all know in our hearts this was achieved through illegal means we can't do that in the long-term I opened this kabushiki gaisha because I wanted us to have a legal business to run an entertainment club on the lowest rent a licensed one, not illegal and, to grab the control of the Taiwan gang so that we can protect ourselves we hear you, steelhead we'll follow your lead we have all suffered that's why I want to set aside some money to help those who have just arrived. Help them find jobs I want this responsibility to go to... How about to jie? Everyone ok? Good! Then I would like to do something that interests me in future, the business here will go to...
