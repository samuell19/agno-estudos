Try something weird. This one, all in purple. You do not want to? Okay, wouldn't that be your style? What are you saying? No not true. You will regret it. Really crazy, with this hat. You rock every party with it. Okay, here then... blue, blue. Here, a denim jacket. Should i take it? Try it. Hey, hello! - Hey! What are you doing? Get away quick, get away quickly! What's up, guys? Get lost! I'm sorry, we don't have anything else. Do you have a new fantasy game? No, this is a little more urban but you will definitely like that. I'm looking for number 36. Is she not there? No. You're lucky. Oh. Shit, I have my money forgotten in jeans. Why do I have put on those pants? Then don't you take it? Yes, I'll take it. Clear. And I'll take 37 too. Number 37. You're welcome. What was going on? Wow, where are they from? Out of your pocket. It's full of money. What the hell... Do you know what this means? You have magical gold pants. Wow! And what is that? GPS. You can use it to locate each other. Cool. Wow! Ah! We let go! Do you still drive a moped? Fuck. Fire! OK. Crap! Quick, under the bed. Here, that too, hurry up! I have several types of beer there. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hello. Oh yes, right. Do you want something too? No thanks. Not hungry? We prefer to eat home-cooked food. Yes, like home cooking. Yes, meatless and such. Can David sleep here? Of course, no problem. Well. You have to adjust, huh? - Suddenly you have 2 children. Do you already know this DVD? No. It just came out. So is it good? I do not know you yet. I can insert it sometime. What would you like to drink? You, David. Yes? Where do you mean where the money comes from? I do not know. Are we breaking the law? No, we don't do that. Why do you ask? I do not know. Just because. What is wrong with that? We paid for everything. Nothing was free there. No, we are worth it. Yes. So here are our bills as you can see here. But suddenly some cassettes were emptied. In less than 10 minutes. Can you come in here unnoticed? - No, that's impossible. The vaults are monitored by video. So that's quite impossible. What if it was an insider? - You can't rule that out. But Swedbank also has problems. Organised crime, maybe. And why only 100 Kroner notes? #NAME? Oh what the hell is going on here? Sorry, our computer system is infected by a virus. Every minute thousands of crowns disappear. "Since yesterday some banks are reporting large losses. The police are investigating whether there is a virus invaded the banking systems. Or whether it is organised crime. It is in any case great criminal energy behind it." I have something for you. It's nothing spectacular. It's about William Otto, the managing director of PTT. William Otto? Yes. The Otto brothers nobody knows better than me. Allegedly is William Otto involved in a wreckage. What? That doesn't sound very believable. But yesterday he came to the port escorted by the coast guard. Allegedly one found Money and a corpse. A corpse? Who? Hello? "Did you find something?" #NAME? Impossible. Where are you? - Pier 5. Wait a minute, here is something. Mats Nilsson. Guys, I've got work to do. Until I'm back you have raked all the graves. I really don't feel like it anymore. Yes, it's also uncool. We rake graves my pants are full of money. Hey wait. You tight-fisted, spend one. - No No no. Come on. - no Hello. Does the dwarf mean us? Who wants to earn 1,000 crowns? 1,000 crowns? Are you kidding? Work is just not my thing. Who works the fastest gets 1,000 crowns extra. Hold on, you snore noses. Hey what are you doing Not so tired, grandpa! You have to rake there, not there. Is that right? Thank you. We never have to work again thanks to your Buxe. We keep minions who do everything. And when they strike let's get more money out of our pants. Crap. 60 crowns for you and 60 for you. You're welcome. I have a question. Where did you get your pants from? How so? You get a lot of modelling clay out of there. You stole it. You, not all are thieves. Swear you won't tell anyone Give me 100,000 and I won't say anything. 100,000 do you want? It takes forever to get them out. Be at six behind the swimming pool! Did I say 200,000? I meant 3. 295, 296. 297. 298. 300,000. Do you have the money? Wow how much is that? 300,000 as you want. Now let's be clear. Where did you get the damn money from? Are these really the pants? That does not concern you. Go away! We will not accept that. "Lots of banks report losses. But the police conclude from this not yet on a connection." There was a report about it. - It's happening again. You here... #NAME? That's how you can put it. - There's chaos upstairs. Well, what do the security guys say? - Yeah, it could be an insider. The circumstances are however exceptional. Maybe it works some form of financial terrorism. But a couple of 100,000 crowns... - It's not about the sum. There would be unrest. People would withdraw their money. The banking system would collapse and thus our society. We need to track down the money Review surveillance videos. Talk to the salespeople. Together we find out who is behind it. I had because of the looting of the shipwreck called. Torkel Nilsson, journalist, yes. Do you already know who the dead man is? AHA OK. I'll call you again, thank you. Mats. Are you hungry? Mats, do you fancy pizza? I'll get us one, what do you think? We can hang out a bit. Do not you have to. I like to do that. I am your father. And it's really great Spending time with his son. You never had time for me That's not true. You kept forgetting to pick me up from school. And my birthdays did you forget. No, I was there with presents. 2 times, yes. I thought that was more often. I travelled a lot. But now we're together. And there we can being there for each other. You, it's because of mom. She didn't tell you everything. Where does it come from? What did you want to say Yes... Susanne... She wants you to live with me. Over the summer. No longer. She rented the apartment. And your things are stored. We can bring yours here. You are lying No, I will not do that. The years alone were difficult for her. How should I live with you? You can't even cook. Where do you want to go I'd rather be dead than with you But let's talk again. Mats! Hey. A 100 Kroner prepaid card, please. Yes very much. Moment. I mean 500 Kroner. "Hey, this is Susanne. I'm not there right now. Leave your name and I like to call you back. Have a nice day. See you soon." What is there? Get lost! What's happening? Don't give a fuck of yours. Understand. Consoling is not my thing. Here you have one who is good at it. His name is Batman. I found it in a container. Somebody threw him in there. Without me he would be dead. He lay there and whined. Yes, come here, just sit down. Space is the only thing what I've had enough of. And what is your name? Mats. I am Zeke. You don't work anymore in the cemetery, right? No, you have done the job. Oh well This is a pity. I still have a thousand can use. That would have worked. I can buy Batman from you. It's not for sale. How much do you want? Don't you hear what I'm saying The dog is all I have. Say a price. 5,000? 5,000. Where did you get all the money from Okay then 10,000. Remember what you could buy. Sparkling wine and wine and whatever you want. Can i hold it again Yes, as long as you want. But I'm not selling it. Okay, the deal is on. Sold for 10,000. No wait. Wait. I want my dog back! Man say something Hello? You're not even sleeping yet. #NAME? Papa asks whether you visit him on the weekend. You haven't been for a long time with him in jail. Let's see. I do not like it. You are alone too much. Lexi asks why you're not coming. - Tell her I hate this place! I keep thinking about it. If he's dead and it's my fault. He is not dead. How do you know? I called the hospital. They didn't want to say anything but it was clear that he was there. Take it, I haven't touched anything. And why? Because I'm not a thief. Who still knows about it? No one but you. But where does it come from? Do not ask. The less you know, the better. Somebody has to have the money but miss. How, gone? #NAME? And what about this Mats Nilsson? Check out all the places he might be. And don't come without the pants back! Hey. Did I wake you? No. Not at all, no, no. Because of the body that was found... I'm still waiting for an answer. One of our boys asked around. The dead man was Gustav Otto. He must have been dead a long time. Didn't Gustav Otto flee? "No, William Otto says they would have lost contact." And he thought his brother would have killed himself. That's why he was looking for him. He dived every wreck. "It's stupid but not a serious crime." He is unrecognisable. Maybe we should bring the pants to the police. What? Are you crazy? A pair of pants with coal that will never run out. What do you think will happen then? I don't know. They take hold of you and your pants and you have to work off the money. He's right, the people are selfish and so are cops. Why did the pants come to me? Is there any point in it? Ask the man. Batman! Hey, Batman. What are you doing here? Hey. What's going on here? Are you kidding me? No. Someone wants to apologise. Yes I. Sorry. All right. I am used to to be kicked. I'm always in people's way. Not any longer longer. For a few days anyway. You live here. We paid a week. One week? Should i stay a week? Yes. Check out the pickles. They taste really good. It all tastes good. Even the hospital gnawing was great. I sat at a set table. I haven't done that for a long time. How did you get homeless? It started after the sick leave. I was a truck driver, yes. I went to France. To Italy and elsewhere. I've been everywhere. They suddenly got scared because I have a hole in my heart From birth. They got scared and fired me and then the woman was gone too. Bottom up! So it started. You had a wife Yes, yes, a really cute one. Hello man She and the boobs were tall, as big as bowling balls. It was a playground. A playground with 2 turrets. Splendid. I also had a daughter. She should be your age. We never saw each other again. Never seen again? No, that's the way it is. What's her name? Can you use the bathtub? Yes, of course it's yours. Splendid. So I'll tell you one thing. I'll never forget this. You can believe me. That's just damn awesome. We're giving the money out of the pants to people who have a hard time. Around the world. We take care of medicine, schools, Food and water, of course. Here, Water Aid, UNICEF. Write down: A World of Friends. Latin America, Afghanistan. Okay, go on! Child Cancer Aid. Save the pandas. Wait, not so fast. SOS Children's Villages. Doctors Without Borders. Sea rescuer. Slowly! Technical aid organisation, Child emergency service. How much do we have 914,500. Wow! How much do we want to give? 50 million. 50 million? Just to start with. Sounds good. But what if they ask? We send the money anonymously directly to the organisations. 100 five hundred in every letter. What do i get when I say where he lives? Take a seat! How did you do that? Just stirred together. And what do you say? Well. As good as Susanne's? She's boiling really bad. You, Mats... You said, that I was a bad father. I did not say that. No, but you meant it. You're right. But I want to, that you know that I... That I always thought of you I always had a photo of you with me. With all jobs around the globe. To my colleagues I said: Here, this is my son. I look dark. Do you find? No. You look great. Now you don't need a photo anymore. Because I'm not going away? No, because I am there. "Today it was sunny and it will stay that way." Rain is hardly to be expected. The temperatures are during the day at 20 °C and at night at 10 °C. The wind is blowing from the west. "Wishing you a lovely evening." "Good evening." According to the National Bank, the banks will be closed from Monday. The reason is that money has mysteriously disappeared. Like a series of unresolved cases Late 1990s. Even back than one thing was puzzling: At first there are only 100 Kroner notes and 500 Kroner bills disappeared. Other values remained unaffected. "Met in Brussels the foreign ministers of the EU..." Father. Suppose you see something unbelievable. Something totally impossible what do you do then? What do you think? But don't freak out or freak out. You have your wages got from the cemetery. The banks, the missing bills... The money ends up somehow in my pants. And how? No idea. But... holy shit. That's what the pants do? Show me again! So that's behind it. I knew something was wrong. But I couldn't fix it. PTT developed rapidly to a leading company. The Otto brothers have it financed with these pants. Who are these Otto's? They make weapons. One is dead and the one at... Does anyone know you have it? No, just David and Livli. Livli? A girlfriend. Okay, did you spend the money? We gave most of it Aid organisations. How much? 50 million roughly. 50 million? Do you know how much that is Do you know that? We wanted to give more. Maybe that's my job. This is a huge thing. 50 million crowns. They'll put you in jail. No, you are still a child. We have to be quiet. No hasty things. And what exactly should I do? I don't know. Oh my god, I don't know. Ah. Where is the boy? Ah! Ah! Where is the boy? Run! Damn it! Stop! Stop! What's happening? Papa, you have papa. Hey, come in. Thank you. Don't panic I'm alone like every weekend. I looked for BDT and Otto. Then I found the company PTT. Phoenix Target Technology. What's this? An arms factory up in Värmland. That's them. They'll be in touch soon. You are hardly after your father. Shouldn't we go to the police? We can hide the pants. The police are looking for us anyway. 2:37 p.m. at this time the marked notes disappeared. 2:39 pm. There! Zoom in! 2 boys? - We have several shots. Always the same. - Do We have the names? No. We cooperate with the authorities for Finance and white-collar crime. We want to get them before Monday. Otherwise the banks will close again. You know what that can mean. "Because of current events investors threaten to migrate. The Financial Stability Department is very concerned. The confidence in economic strength and in the euro could dwindle." There are a crisis meeting. With foreign security services and the Swedish government. This is not the first meeting. It is feared that it is a secret weapon got into the wrong hands. We should stop the development and confiscate the item. Coffee? No? You come to me somehow familiar. Have we seen each other before? I have a report made about you and your brother. Ah yes. I remember. A really nice report. I even saved it. I know a lot about you William Otto. You and Gustav founded with 500 million PPT. The year before was across the country Money disappeared from bank vaults. 500 million to be precise. A strange meeting. You say so. What's up with the pants? Who knows? I thought you ought to know. Maybe you come from God. That didn't matter to Gustav. He has constantly spoken of these pants. I thought he was a weirdo a fool who believes in fairy tales. But he never doubted. He looked for them all these years. And one day he came up with it. At first it wasn't a problem. We shared everything. But then he made trouble and I had to control him. He fled to the sea. Not very clever. He was a lousy skipper. Then I looked those damn pants. If the coast guard hadn't come everything would have gone according to plan. My men hide their pants in the harbour, but there was chaos. When they wanted to get the pants they were gone. Until now. Where is the boy? Ah... I want to know where the boy is! Where is he hiding? I don't know. Ah! Stop it! Hello! "Mats." Father! Where are you? Father! You have something i want Come to the port at five thirty. "Pier number 8, and no police, when your father is supposed to come back." Okay, let's go. Hey what's that? My secret weapon. Come. Is that you? Sure, who else? Where is Dad? Why is my father not here? Maybe he's still in the car. What if that's a trick? You scared But i will do it. Wait a minute, wait. We are here now. Nobody to see. Yes OK. Damn. I shoot. It's too dangerous. Give me money. What for? Come on. Take the GPS and keep an eye on me Hello here I am, the boy with the gold pants. Where is my father? He's waiting in a safe place. No. We have to go to the police. You know that is not possible. I should do this, not him! How does the GPS work? Oh! Give it to me. They're going north out of town. What shall we do now? Get a driver and of course a car. But I don't have a key. No problem, you can do without it. Okay, get in! You are driving north on the E 45. I think they are going to Värmland. We should refuel up there. Do you need a break No, damn it, I'm used to that. I thought of your heart That knocks very lively. You... I have again thought about our conversation. About my daughter. Her name is Emma. I know, I let her down I hope she understand when she is a little older. That she'll understand me then. If it's not too late then. But that's okay. The gasoline too? Yes. 820 crowns. We have a tip from a gas station. Have police barriers set up. It starts. #NAME? Do you mind if I listen to the radio? #NAME? They are almost in Norway. "The police were looking for clues roadblocks because of the banks." Attention! Hold on! After! Hold tight! Great, Zeke. You drive like a car thief. All good? Damn! You come back! What now? Out out! Hide yourself, quick! We have to get out of here. We go to the road and hitchhike. Not a good idea. Do you have a better plan? We should wait a while. A car. There's a car coming. Hold on, mats, be careful. Hello, do you need help? - run! Police! Stop! Ah! Stop! You're welcome. We want to help you. Take it easy. Away, Mats! Ouch! Here, crouch. They are coming. Come over. You are that long. #NAME? Look for you over there. - Okay. Hey Stop! Hide there Away there! - Ah! There. Damn it! You can't be far. Come here. You have to be through here. 43-20, please come. #VALUE! They're gone. And the others? #VALUE! It belongs to Torkel Nilsson. Drive to him. Come over. What's this? You're bleeding. Nothing more, just a graze. And now? We can't go back to the street. Logical. We follow the tracks. They lead there. Crap. And how far? A couple of miles. David seems to have arrived. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? This is not the boy. #NAME? The pants are not. Where is he? Who then? "The apartment belongs to Nilsson, secured, over." Okay, we're coming in. Come over. Look at that. Okay, let's get them. Now come my mother and my sister home. You always come at the time when they visited papa. Why don't you go with me? I did that. But I can't handle it. Even the clothes that my father wears there. Papa always had fancy clothes. Do you want to talk about it? It wasn't just my father. The others cheated a lot more. But only Papa condemned them. He said he did it for us. So that we feel better. But we had everything. How could he do this to our family? People do everything for money. Promise me, that we never become like this. Come over! No! Sleep. Petrol. Okay, we're here. That never works. Finally get it! Yes, it will work. Trust me! "The car has been located. We'll send you his position." Okay, we're coming. Hey, I'm Mats. "Mats Nilsson, the boy with the gold pants. Let William Otto know." How did you find us? With the GPS. You're smarter than you look. Where are the pants? She burns them if you disobey me. Get Dad and David. You have 10 seconds. 1, 2. 3, 4. He's gambling. Yes. 5. 9. Okay mats. 10. You won. Bring her here. First the pants. Let Dad and David go free first! Then you get the pants. We swap places. You are allowed to go and you give me the pants. No promise To let mats go? That's obvious. I always keep my word. Come here! Run to the highway. I'll follow you then. Now go dad! Trust me. I would rather burn them. But I also keep my word. But not me. Lock him up and get the others. Let me go! Shut up! Ha! Come here! After! Get in! Hurry up! Come. I have it! Great! Well done mats. More quickly! Faster, Zeke! You are right behind us! Duck down, children! More quickly! Ah! Ah! Everybody out! Zeke. Zeke! Out! Come on, mats. Zeke. Mats, come on. Let me! Come over! Zeke! Run! Run! Come, come! Come on, Livli! Come over! I can not. I'll help you. She is injured. Fuck there you are! More quickly! This way. Down. Quietly. Oh! Stop, otherwise I'll let go of her. No! Wait. Think about it! No! Ah. Here, take your pants. You will not dare doing that, you disgusting pants shit. No. No, Mats, don't do that. Police! Lie down! On the ground! Put your gun down! - Take it easy. Drop the gun! Come on! - Hands over your head! Put your gun down! Put the gun down, Mats. Put the gun down, do you hear? Bring your pants. Come on, bring it on. Do what i say. Then everything will be fine. It doesn't fall into the wrong hands. No dad. I am a cop. Trust me. No! All good. I am here. I'm with you. "32-F, please come." - Here 32-F, what's up? "We have here a seriously injured person. It's not safe, whether he can do it." We say goodbye today by Erik Zeke Zetterqvist. And we give it into God's hands. We are full of sadness and pain. But we are also grateful for that Zeke shared his life with us. Zeke had a weak heart. But it was a good heart. It hit hard for those that he worried about. It was particularly hard for Emma, to which he unfortunately lost contact. All of us has his own memories of Zeke. Who he was and what he meant to us. Now we want to say goodbye. We have to leave him behind. But we take his memory with us. And so is Zeke live on in each of us. Can you wait a moment? Here, his name is Batman. I think Zeke would have wanted that you take care of him. He's pretty good at comforting. This Mats Nilsson, what do we do with that? "The economy stabilises again." The base rate will be for the time being leave it at one percent. A surge of anonymous donations surprised aid organisations. Cash in considerable amounts was sent in envelopes. Many projects have started. This is how remote places became supplied with food and medicine. Schools were built and water projects emerged. The willingness to donate in Sweden has increased immensely as a result. "The donation is higher than ever." "Generosity grows. The population donates more and more."
