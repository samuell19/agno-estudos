My goodness, well, they'll figure it out. Caramba, you haven't told me yourself. I wouldn't have believed it was senora. A bonita. - With your permission. - That's the truth, Christina. I find it hard to believe that you were the girl. You made fun of and teased and then she cried. That was me, Eduardo. - You know you almost took my breath away when I saw you walk in tonight. In less than ten years, I see you've become lovelier than ever. You're still a terrible liar, Eduardo? Eduardo, I believe you. - You will make me part of what I am, when you accept this ring from me. - Let's go now and tell Papa. - No, let's follow custom. My father will come and plead my cause. Your father will not refuse. What's that? - Sounds like, sounds like a woman in pain. - It seems to come from below. Is there a... - Let's go see. - Is there a room on the other side? - No. - I think it's coming from here. Who's upstairs? - Father. - Pa? Pa? Pa? - Let's take him to his bed. - That testament you have gives you the legal right as my administrator to dispose of all my possessions and... - But you should know this is out of the question. You have two grown children who are your rightful heirs. - All this I've done thinking only of their welfare. - I'm sure you have your reasons. Over what you demand of me as-- - As my administrator, I have given you the expressed responsibility to burn to the ground this cursed house. - Burn the villa? - Yes, padre. Raze it till not a stick is left of the house of Escudero. Not so much as a stick. That is my last will and testament to all you. - As you wish Don Enrique. I regret this, Eduardo. Your father is... let's go Christina. - Now that you have taken care of your material concerns, it is time to discuss matters of the spirit. - Leave us by ourselves. Excuse me, Eduardo. That's impossible. - It's the truth, Padre. Believe me, believe me. - Just tell me the rest of it. Adios, Eduardo. - Papa, you changed your last will and testament. But why, Papa? Why? - It's no concern of yours. It's my affair. - I distinctly heard what you told your administrator. Burn down this house of ours the moment you take leave of us. - Yes, that's correct. This is my will and I don't want a word of it-- - With that position... with that one provision, you made it clear you no longer care for us. You cared for us once. There was never any doubt about that. What has changed, Papa? - Nothing. Nothing has changed, Eduardo. - Something has. You promised me, because I'm your eldest child and your only son, that I would administer this entire estate Escudero. And that this house would be mine! - Eduardo... - Father? Pa, forgive me, Papa. - I can no longer care about myself. The anguish of these terrible years. The time has come for you to help me. Praise the truth and learn to live with it. - What are you saying? - Just come with me. Here, take this. No, it's alright. Follow me. - What is that coffin for, Papa? Who's is it? Open it. Open it. Closer, Eduardo. Closer, I say. Look at her. Yes, yes, Eduardo. A poor old cursed creature. - Mama. I can't understand this, Papa. - Do you know why I sent you away right after she died? - No. - Everyday, from the time she was buried, I would go to the mausoleum to pay my respects to her memory. And there, to offer my prayers. When nine days had gone by, I realized the curse had struck. - Don Enrique, when a young man wanders along the byways of life, he's bound sometime to chance upon a garden. This very thing has happened to my only son, and he has found a flower. - Stop this beating around the bush. Let's get directly to the point. - You must bear with me, Don Enrique. I was merely following custom. - The devil without customs. Tell me what you're trying to say. - Don Enrique, with all respect, I beseech you to allow me to take to myself the hand of Leonore. - What if I refuse to grant you so? - I'm in love with him, Papa, and I really believe that he loves me too. - Not this, Leonore. I will not entertain the thought of your marriage to Daniel, or to any other man. - Tell me what to do, Don Enrique. I will do anything you wish to change your mind. - That's out of the question. Number two, Escudero. Being an Escudero, I will not change my mind ever. Now leave me alone. All of you. Should we go? - If that is your decision, then I will obey, Papa. But, I'm also an Escudero. And nothing can make me change my feelings. - Don't go in there. - But Why? What's going on behind the wall in Papa's room? - It would be much better for you if you didn't know. - Well, I'm going to find out. - Enough. I don't want to hurt you, but you leave no choice. Marin's name, in the name of God. - That woman over there, I think I know. - Leonore, that's enough. - Papa! - Leonore. The chains. - Let's go, Leonore. - Am I losing my mind, Eduardo? But that woman, I think I recognize her. - That's her, Leonore. That's her. - But, I know Mama's dead. I saw her the day she died. I was there, I cried at her grave. I saw them when they buried her. - Yes, you were. But what you and I are seeing now is not just a terrible dream. Our mother is... is a vampire. - Vampire? - In the day time, she sleeps. In the night time, she wakes to feed on human blood that she must have in order to sustain her life! Leonore, I'm sorry you have to learn it this way. - Keep away from her. Don't hurt her. - You're insane. Stop it! I know how you feel, but don't think of her as being alive. - But she's moved and cried. - She's dead, Leonore. What you're seeing is just a shell. It moves and cries only through the power of Satan. For many years I've kept this a secret from you, and now you know the whole truth at last. Now you understand why I am so much against your marrying anyone. Daniel? Daniel? - I've been waiting here for some time. - I wanted to see you because I'd like to return your-- - Before you say a word, bear this in mind, I cannot respect your father's objections. I only know that I will not live without you. What do you mean by that? - Accept this, Daniel. I'm giving you back your freedom now. - Look, is this happening to us? Is this really happening? - I'm releasing you from all your promises. You must learn to forget. Try to love someone else. - You no longer love me. That is the truth. You're not in love with me anymore. - Awhile ago, you told me that no matter how you felt, you would ask nothing of me that would bring me pain. Oh, Daniel, now the moment has come. We have to face certain things. However desperately we tried to cling to our dreams, they can't protect us now. You have to let me go. - But how can I understand? Your telling me how dear I am to you, and still you're turning this-- - Of course you won't understand it now. Perhaps some day, Daniel. - Leonore, I love you. - And I love you, Daniel. - I love you. I... - I love you, I can love no one else. - Daniel. - I'm Eduardo, Mama. Don't you remember your own son? Ma, why? I'm Eduardo, Mama. No need to be afraid. - Get, chain her. - Leave her alone, I say. - That's the only way, Eduardo. I put her in chains every night so she won't harm the people, Eduardo. - I told you to keep your hands off her! - But Eduardo. - My fear is that you might become like her, Eduardo. A vampire. Leave me alone. - Eduardo, this is Leonore. It's been days since you've come out of your room. Leave me alone, I say. - Whatever it is that's troubling you now will pass away sooner or later. Leave me alone, hear me? Leave me alone! - Senorita, senorita. Senorita, Daniel is downstairs. He would like to talk to you. Shall I ask him to come up? - No. Just tell him... tell him I have a very bad headache and cannot see him now. - Just give her my regards. Eduardo. - Who was it? Who did this to you? But how can I avenge this crime if you won't tell me who did this? - It was I who found her in the middle of a field. I have no proofs, only suspicions that-- - She was raped, padre, and cruelly bitten in the neck by some... some beast. - I swear this to you, that the beast who did this will pay for it with his life. - Good evening to you, Daniel. - Good evening. - Where's your father? - Come in, Eduardo. - I have come here to right a most dishonorable deed. - Dishonorable deed? - I'm here to ask for the hand of your daughter Christina. I'm ready to marry her. - Are you aware that Christina's been injured? - I am aware and that is the reason that I am... Daniel, don't. - If you're the monster who did this to my sister, then accept this challenge. Let us fight to the finish. You have the choice of weapons. - Eduardo. - If you give your permission, I wish to be married to Christina as soon as possible. Eduardo shall rule you from now on. I, Eduardo am your lord and your only master. I am your life. - You are my lord. I am your slave. - Go get her. Exactly now. Watch your head. Don't let her go. Don't let her go! Come this way. What are you doing? I beg of you. This way. No, no, no, no! I beg of you, I beg of you. Let us take her to the hills. Burn her. Eduardo, your mother is... Oh, my God. - Leonore, wait, Leonore. On your father's grave, I swore, I swore that I would fulfill all the dreams and aspirations that he had for you while he lived. - Haven't I told you? It's no use at all, Daniel. Don't ever do this again. - I won't accept that. I don't believe it. I swear to God to love you and to protect you. - There's nothing more to say, Daniel. It doesn't matter anymore. - I, Enrique Escudero de Victoria, be of sound health and mental judgment-- - Don't bother reading those useless opening lines, Don Julio. - Listen, Eduardo. - What is important right now is that we learn how my father has decided to dispose of all his properties without delay. If it's agreeable to Leonore. - You can do as Eduardo says, Don Julio. - Very well, here it is. To Sabastero Galda, who has served my household loyally and faithfully for a span of more than 37 years, I bequeath 27 hectares of rice land from the north side of my hacienda. And so that he may be able to build a house, the amount of 10,000 pesetas. And to my two children, namely Eduardo and Leonore, the balance of my estate and my other holdings, after payment of the royal taxes and other legitimate claimants, all of which is to be divided equally between the two according to established value, excepting-- - Except for what, Don Julio? - Excepting the Villa Escudero, which I herby command under supervision of Don Julio Castillo, my administrator, three days after my remains return, to be burned down to its very foundation. - I will not allow that. Under no conditions will I permit such an outrage. - Eduardo, we know the reason Papa had. This is something he wanted to do even when he was alive. We have no right to cast his wish aside. - Whatever his reason, I won't allow it. - Eduardo. - Get away from me. As the eldest and only son of my father, Don Enrique, I claim as his successor, absolute try to dispose of this property is a truce. And I propose to exercise this right without interference from anyone. - Eduardo. - Stay away from me! - Eduardo, as administrator, I must advise you that I'm duty bound to defend the terms of your father's testament. Further, as counselor and friend to the late Don Enrique, I expressly caution you, and I am bound by my office to do all I can to carry out the terms of his testament. Eduardo! Stop it! - I told you to stay away from me. - Forgive me, Leonore. Please accept my regrets. - And now we meet. I will kill you at last. My only regret is that I want to-- Get over it. - You're not going to get out of this. I've waited too long to let you go. - Daniel, don't! You mustn't stain your hands with the blood of an Escudero. It will accomplish nothing. - My father's soul is in sorrowing, and I am left to fulfill all his duties. - I will do whatever you say. Wherever you want me to go, I will go. - If I agree to spare your brother's life, it is not to ask for anything in return. - But I love you, Dan. - You expect me to believe that? What do you want? - I wish I could make you understand what a nightmare this has been since we came home. If only I could make you understand. - Maybe there's a reason for this. But as long as you hide from me, as long as you lie to me, how can I understand? If you owe me anything, it's the truth. - And yet the truth, the truth would sound much more like a lie. - Anything that my eyes can see, that I'll believe. Show it to me. - Then you have to promise me that if I tell you, I can count on your understanding. - That I promise you. - In that case, follow me to the house. - What is this? What place is this? - Look down there. - That coffin? - This is my mother's tomb. In that coffin lies her body. - What? Night after night her body cries for blood. It's all in your mind. None of it has happened. - No, Daniel, I'm telling you the truth now. My mother is a... is a living corpse. She's a vampire. We're vampires. - You must stop this now. - Vampires, we're vampires! - You must stop this. - Vampires, Daniel! - Enough, in the name of God, stop this! Come to your senses, Leonore. There are no such thing as vampires in this world. You're only imagining it. You're not a vampire. Listen to me. You're not. - If only it weren't true. If only I were just dreaming. - All of this, it's nothing more than a bad dream. - And yet, I want to bring happiness into our life together, but I am my mother's daughter, and her destiny is also my destiny. We are both cursed. - Leonore, I can't live without you. I'm part of your life. No matter what happens to you. Leave with me tonight. Let's get away from this place. As far away as we can. - And wherever I go, I will be pursued by this curse on our family. - There is no curse that can prevail over God. We shall pray for deliverance, with all our hearts. And we must be heard. - I'm too frightened to try. Not for myself, but for you. - There is no danger that I cannot face as long as I have you. - Daniel. Leonore, you must believe this. I will never leave you. - I will come with you again. Take me wherever you want. Anywhere you pick, I will go. - Right now, Leonore. We can leave this house right now. - Careful, Tensho. - The brakes aren't working. - What? - Daniel? Daniel? Daniel? - My God, do not let her die. Take my life. My life in place of hers. My God. Save her. My... my God. I will wait for you by the foot of the hills. I shall hear your voice. I shall hear it with the wind. Whenever you need me, I shall come to you. You need only call my name, and I shall come to you. Just call it, Leonore. I shall hear you. I promised to take care of you, and I always will. - Yes, Leonore, it is I. Don't try to move now. Give yourself a chance to rest. - How long? How long have I-- - You've been lying unconscious for over three days. You must realize that you're a very sick girl. - And yet, where are you? - You have to do as the doctor tells you, Leonore. You need absolute rest and quiet to recover. - Daniel. I wanna speak to him. - He's dead, Leonore. He was buried yesterday afternoon. You were still unconscious. - No, no, Daniel is not dead! No, oh, no! - I've just given her a sedative. This is not a time to argue. - Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel! Daniel! Daniel. Daniel, Daniel. Oh, Daniel. Daniel. Isn't it funny? I was afraid. Did you know, they said you were-- - Yes, I know. I was listening to them. They said I was dead. - Only you're alive. Look at you. You're not even hurt. Would you believe it? They all tried to tell me you'd been killed. They all looked as if I were going out of my mind. Daniel, Daniel, tell me that you're really here. - I am here because I love you. And because you trust me. - Oh, Daniel. The ring, Daniel. The ring I returned to you. Where is it? I have it here, Leonore. I have it. - Put it back on my finger. - I'm sure I heard another voice in this room. - But she's all alone. - Remove the cross from around her neck. Remove it. Now leave us alone. - Daniel? Daniel? - I've already told you, Daniel is dead. - He's not, though. Daniel is alive. Just a while ago, I was talking to him. He was here. Didn't you hear? He's dead. - No, Eduardo, look at this ring. This ring I'm wearing. He gave it to me. Why can't you believe me, Eduardo? Daniel is alive. - If you wanna see him, I'll take you to his grave in the cemetery. - No, no, no, Eduardo. No. No. No. No. Why are you looking at me like... like that? - You're lovely, Leonore. So lovely. - Eduardo, Eduardo, I'm your sister! Have you taken a leave of senses? I'm your sister. - My beautiful, beautiful sister. - Ed... Eduardo. - Leonore. - Eduardo. - Your lovely hair. Your eyes. Your neck. - Daniel, Daniel? Oh, no. - Did you call for anyone, senorito? Se Senorito? - Daniel? Daniel? - It won't be long now. She'll finally become one of us. What's that? - I have done everything I can do for her. All we can do now is to watch and wait. - In that case, let me see what I can do. - What's happening to her face? - The devil himself is in this room. We are powerless. - Here. Get down. - They're burning the house.
