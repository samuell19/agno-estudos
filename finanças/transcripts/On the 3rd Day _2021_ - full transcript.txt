Hello. Enrique. Yes. It's me. They're waiting for you in Santa Cruz with the cargo. God willing, this be your last trip. What do you think, shall we go on a trip? What about my shower? Nah, it doesn't matter. You can shower tomorrow. - Yay! - Yay! Can I take him? Yeah, of course. He'll be our guest of honor. And Dad, is he coming? Ready, let's go. Let's go. Hey! Hey! Hey! Well, you look for her again. What for? She won't come back. You know nothing. You're wasting your time. Time isn't wasted or gained, just goes by, that's all. You should realize that. - What? - How can I say this? If the dog didn't come back, it's because she's dead. Calm down, calm down. We'll help you. Hello? Yes. I nee... I need an ambulance now. At the service station. The highway exit to the west area. Yes, as urgent as possible. Help. That blood's not yours. Help. It's not yours. No, no, no. Ofelia, stop saying those things. I sometimes believe the door will open and they will come for me. You know that. Where do you get those ideas? You, the doctors, you made our lives longer. And we are still here. - Yeah. - And now we don't wanna leave. We need to talk. Just rest. If you keep on improving, you'll leave, but to your house. Stop crying, think! Answer. Where's my son? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Who are you? Why are you here? I'm her husband, former... former husband. Well, you... you can't be in this bedroom. I know, I know, but he's my son, and I'm his father. It was at night. What? It was very cold. It was so dark. Well, you can't be in this room. Please let her rest. What are you doing? I had a nightmare. Come. No. Easy. Shh. Easy. What's up? I dreamt of my son. I can't take it anymore, I need to find him. Come on. Easy. Come. That's it, that's it, easy. Easy, that's it. Sit down. There we go. Very good. You have to sleep more. I will prescribe you more pain killers, hmm? - Excuse me. - And Martin? - Huh? - Martin. They're looking for him. Yeah. You have to calm down. The police are on it, they know what to do. The police are coming to see you. They wanna talk to you. Excuse me. Dr. Pastori. - A pleasure. - Inspector Ricardo Ventura. Nice to meet you. I've come to see your patient Amato, Cecilia Amato. - Yes. - Mm-hmm. Follow me. She suffered a severe brain injury, and she shows a case of general weakness, a consequence of the accident we presume, but we also found a unique underlying pathology. Um, a rare kind of leukemia. Keep it simple, Doctor. What exactly is her problem? I'm still working on that. Her condition isn't stable. We also believe that she was abused. Did she tell you anything about the kid? - Not much. - Uh-huh. - She remembers that he was with her. - Exit - Mm-hmm. - Um, that she crashed. Mm-hm. Shh, shh. - Look, Doctor, this is a very complicated case. - Guard We found Ms. Amato's car and another car right beside it registered to Lucía Figaro. Both your patient's son, as well as this woman have vanished off the face of the Earth. Shh, shh. Shh. Shh, shh. But Doctor, you know what the strangest part is? The experts say that it was three days ago. Where were they all? Where was your patient all this time, Doctor? Lost because of the shock. Being involved in an accident doesn't make her a suspect. My profession has taught me not to trust anybody. We're all capable of hurting others, don't you think? Doctor, room 216 is empty. Doctor, come over here quick. - Peralta. - What now, Ventura? Get me the forensics team to the hospital right away. Room number 217. We've got a suspicious death. Very suspicious. 10-4. Help me, help, help me! Let me out, let me out, let me out! Please, please! Help! My Lord, I invoke your name for the soul of Lucía... Let me out! Let me! If you don't behave, I'll let in there forever. If you behave, maybe I'll let you out. Choose. I can wait, you can't. Help me! What's the problem, Doctor? My patient is lost. She's at risk. Her test results were not what I expected. I... I need to know how she's doing. All right, follow me. No! Martin! No! Where are you, Martin? Don't go away. Where is Martin? I... I don't know, but I'll find him. We can look for him together. We both... Try to remember and tell me where my son is. I don't know. Try to remember and tell me, where is my son? Think goddammit! Where's my son? Think! Think! Where? Think! Where is my son? Where is my son? Where is my son? No, no, no, no, you wait here. It's me. Don't shoot. You can't come in here like that! I'm sorry, I me... I meant to help. You almost died trying to help. Don't help anymore. Get out of here! Peralta. - Yeah. - It's Ventura. What now? Is forensics still at the hospital? Yes, we're here. - Write this down. - Yes. Sutherland Street, 1987. Send them here. I want you there all night. - Things are getting serious. - 10-4. It's me, Cecilia. Don't stop. Don't stop. Please help me, I'm not feeling well. Listen, please help me. Thanks. I told you... after the shock you suffered, your perceptions may be altered. I see things. Come. Look. What? Don't... don't you see that? - Hello? - Yes. This is Hernan Pastori. Sorry for calling you now, but I need a favor. I quit that a long time ago, Doctor. It's important, trust me. There's a boy missing. We run a lot of risk with this. You know what you're asking me for, don't you? Yes. All right, at 12 o'clock. Shh. Easy. My family must be searching for me, and they'll find me. What do you want? Why am I here? Are you deaf? Answer me, answer me. Let me go. Let me go, please. I'm gonna let you go when you tell me what I want to know. But I don't know. - Got it? - I don't know what you mean. - No? - I don't know. I don't! Help me! I had nothing to do with that. Nothing to do with that. I don't know what you mean. I don't know what you're saying. I just... hey, let me out! Help me! Hi. I'm going to see you. - Listen, I can't talk right now... - Doctor. - I'll call you back. - Doctor. - Yes. - You in a hurry to get somewhere? - A bit. - It's just a moment of your time. - Fine. - We're looking for Cecilia Amato, and we need something from you. I don't get it. Things are getting extremely complicated. The kid is missing, Lucía Figaro is missing, the third car is missing, and now Fernando Garro, who is your patient's ex-husband is also missing. It's strange isn't it? - It's strange. - Yeah. It seems that every single person involved in the accident is disappearing. Excuse me. Doctor, if you hear anything from her, you'll let me know, right? - Of course. - Good. Get in. Shall we? The police came to see me. Do they know anything about Martin? No. They told me your former husband disappeared. Have you seen him? Are you listening? Yes. Yes, I saw him. He showed up at my house when I was changing my clothes and grabbing some money. We had an argument. He hit me. I tried to fight back, and I ran away. Here we are. What are we going to do here? Relive that night. Peralta, I've got Cecilia Amato. She's at a house with Pastori in. I'm going in. Don't even think about it, Ventura. Wait for the search warrant. Another fuck up and you're out, copy? Welcome. Come in please. You are sure about what we're going to now? This is the room, but we have to prepare first. No, please. We shouldn't waste more time. Cecilia. Come with me. Here, sit down. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm just dizzy, that's all. Tell me. It... it was very dark, I couldn't see well. So you were afraid? Yes. So tell me, where did they go? West, through the woods by the service area. Due west? Across the service station. Yes. Lord, Lord of Heaven, I call upon thee to reap the fruits of this forbidden tree. Give me strength to face the root of this abomination. Can I go now? Yes, child, of course, of course you can go. You can go. You can go straight to Hell! So this is Martin? I wanna know where he is and what happened to him. Well, you know what relaxation is, don't you? Well, I want you to relax now, and listen only to my voice whilst you watch the metronome. Concentrate on every part of your body. Slowly, very slowly, feel the rhythm of your breathing. Every breath you take, you become lighter, more, and lighter, more, and lighter. I'm going to count to three, and you'll go back to the past. One, two, three. You're going back to the third day. What are you seeing, Cecilia? I see Martin. What's he doing? He's drawing. What's he drawing? He's drawing his favorite white horse. And you, where are you? How's that horse coming along? How do you know I'm drawing a horse? Cecilia, will you open please? Cecilia, what's happening? Fernando. Cecilia, will you open up? We had an agreement. Just two minutes. I kiss the kid and leave. Don't do this. Come on, come on. Martin, come say hi to your father. Hi, Daddy. Hi. How are you? - I'm good. - Fine? Yeah. How about you? Fine, and you? I'm good too. I missed you. I missed you too. Hm. What have you been doing? I was drawing. Ah, drawing. What did you draw? A horsey. - Is this a horse? - Yes. Ah, when I saw it I thought it was a dog. But Dad, you know that I draw horses. Yeah, you're the best with horses. Well, kiss your dad goodbye, he has to go. I'm in no rush. I can stay a little while. - Do you want me to stay? - Yes. Well, he hasn't eaten dinner yet. He has to take a shower. It's late. Well, look what I got for you. - Ta-da. - Thank you, Daddy. - The ones you like, huh? - Mm-hmm. Shall I save them for you for dessert? 'Cause he hasn't eaten yet. It's not good for him to eat trash before dinner. Yeah, what's also not good is when I come to pick him up, you're not here. We were waiting for you, and since you didn't come, we went to the carousel. You can't just do anything you want. You know what? Go over there, I'll talk with Mom. Give me a kiss. Do you think that what you're doing here is okay? I won't argue anymore. It's over. I don't get it, explain yourself. Fernando. Fernando. Fernando, wait. What did you mean? Can you explain? Hmm, okay, I think someone impartial should judge what Martin needs. Who is someone impartial? Someone impartial. Are you gonna buy a judge? I'll come for him tomorrow morning, and I'll take him for a few days. I have the right to be with him. Got it? Tomorrow at 10. Not 10:15, not half past 10, at 10. What's happening? - Tell me. - He wants to take him away, but I won't let him. What do you think, shall we go on a trip? Let's go. What are you doing now, Cecilia? We left. Martin is happy. Everything okay back there? Yes. Do you like the stars? I love the stars. You'll see a lot of them soon. When I was kid, Grandpa used to take me to the park to see the stars. And did you like it? Mm, I loved it. He knew all their names. Do you remember any? No. But we can name them ourselves. Maybe. You see for me that one is called complete burger. That one over there is called fries with ketchup. Oh, yeah, I know that one very well. It's called killer shark. Do you know why? Do you? Because it kisses you to death.

He's passed out. He's not answering. Hey, are you okay? Are you okay? - A doctor. - Yeah. - Call the doctor. - Yes, okay, I'm on it. Yeah. 911, what's your emergency? Hello? Yes, we need an ambulance. Okay. Calm down please. There was an accident. - Where? - On the road. Please, an accident. I don't know... Hello, what happened? Are you there? Hello. It's okay.

Wake her up! It's too late. We have to go all the way to the end. You were right, Ventura. The prints on the broken mirror you had analyzed belong to Cecilia Amato. I have the warrant right here, so you don't have to wait anymore. What's up, Ventura? Aren't you happy? Well, we're going in boys. No one gets hurt, no casualties. All good? Okay. What now, Ventura? Look. Open it. Stop this, Noriega! Noriega, we need stop this! No! What's wrong with her now? Let's go. Cecilia... do you know where Martin is? Where... where are you going? I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of Heaven and Earth, and His son Jesus Christ, His only son, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of Virgin Mary, suffering under the reign of Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried. He descended into Hell. On the third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into Heaven. He is seated on the right hand of God, Father Almighty. From there He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Christian Church, the communion of saints, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. So be it in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Lord I'm not worthy of your presence in my humble abode, but only say the... Hello? Enrique. Yes. It's me. Why are you at home? I ran into trouble. I know, I got a call from Santa Cruz saying that you never arrived. No, no, I could not. What happened? I crashed on the way there, and things got complicated. I lost the cargo. Do you realize this can affect us all? Heads will roll. You know what you need to do. Yes, of course, of course I do. So stop wasting time. I put your mission in the hands of God, your soul as well. Lord, give me the power to transform water into weapon. Protect me when I invoke your holy name, oh, Lord. Amen. You're back. We should wait for the forensic department. They're on their way. Three more bodies, if we don't do something things are just gonna get worse. I'm leaving, Inspector. But where, where are you going? To find her. Copy 506. Help me. Oh, help us, oh, dear Lord. This is not your blood. This is not your blood. I will help you. I had to get to Santa Cruz but you had to obstruct my path. All this mess is your fault. I'm going to the basement whether you want it or not. No, the only place you're going to is hell! There's where I send your kind. There I'll send you. Lord, in your holy name, I vanquish the corrupted fruit of the ancient tree. Back off, Satan! By the cross of the holy father Benedict! By the cross of the holy father Benedict! By the cross, the dragon will not guide me. By the cross of the holy father Benedict! May the light be with me. The dragon will not guide me. The dragon will not guide me. By the cross of the holy father Benedict! By the cross of the holy father Benedict, retreat! Back off, nosferatu! By the cross of the holy father Benedict! Ay. Hi. Martin. Are you okay? Can you stand up? Very good, sweetie, that's it. Can you...? Sweetie, can you walk? That's it. Very good. That's it. Go in here. Careful. - Why are you putting me in here? - I'll be right back. Mommy? Martin, are you all right? - Yes. - Hi. Is it gone? Yes, it's okay now. I'll take care of you. Promise? Promise. Oh, my God, what did I do? You did what you had to do. You ate.
