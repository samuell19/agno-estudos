WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? SHOWDOWN, BELLE. IT'S TIME YOU AND ME HAD ONE. SIT DOWN. WHAT ABOUT? ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. NAME A FEW. ABOUT COMIN' BACK HERE TO TAKE THE BIRD CAGE, FOR ONE THING. WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR THREE WEEKS, AND WHAT'S HAPPENED? NOTHIN'. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW WONDERFUL IT WAS TO HAVE NICE CLOTHES, CLEAN SHEETS ON THE BED, MORE HOT WATER THAN YOU CAN USE. IF YOU'RE ON THE LEVEL, WHY DON'T WE TAKE THE BIRD CAGE NOW AND GET OUT OF HERE? BECAUSE I'M NOT READY TO, AND WHEN I AM, I'LL LET YOU KNOW. I'M STILL DOING THE THINKING FOR THIS OUTFIT. ALL RIGHT, BUT LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT. I SEE YOU GOIN' SOFT ON TOM BRADFIELD, AND I'LL BURN YOU BOTH DOWN. WITH LEAD. AND I'LL GET HIM FIRST, SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. YOU'RE MAKING AN AWFUL FUSS OVER ONE LITTLE KISS. YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THAT'S THE WAY A SMART WOMAN WORKS. NOW, GO ON. GET OUTTA HERE. WHERE ARE YOUR BROTHERS? I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S TEN TIMES YOU'VE ASKED ME THAT QUESTION AND TEN TIMES I TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW. IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER YOU'RE GONNA GET. YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT MAKE YOURSELF A GOOD DEAL IF YOU DID TELL US WHERE THEY ARE. I DON'T MAKE DEALS. WHERE'S BELLE STARR? SHE'S-- SHE'S WITH MY BROTHERS, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. LOCK HIM UP! AND DON'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF HIM. WHEREVER THOSE DALTON BROTHERS ARE, THEY'LL BE COMING AFTER HIM, AND I WANT THEM TO. YOU WANT THEM TO? CERTAINLY. THEN WE GET THE WHOLE DALTON GANG. GOOD IDEA. HEY! HEY, YOU FELLAS! IF YOU GOT ANY FIRE EQUIPMENT, YOU BETTER GET IT TO ROLLIN'. MILLER'S BARN'S GOT ITSELF ON FIRE. - [ Bell Clanging ] - HEY! GET OUT THERE, FOLKS! MILLER'S BARN'S ABOUT TO BURN. BUCKET BRIGADE! BUCKET BRIGADE! FALL IN. THERE'S A BARN BURNING. COME ON! COME ON. [ Clanging Continues ] [ Bell Ringing ] STAY HERE WITH ME. I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES WITH BOB DALTON. ALL CLEAR.

YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. I DON'T GET YOU, BELLE. KNOCKIN' MY GUNS OFF THAT WAY. IF YOU'D-A SHOT TOM BRADFIELD, THEY'D HAVE STRUNG YOU UP RIGHT THERE. NOW YOU FIGURE I OUGHTA BE GRATEFUL TO YOU, HUH? WE'RE SQUARE. YOU GOT ME AWAY FROM THE LAW. I DID THE SAME FOR YOU. THE SLATE'S CLEAN. THAT'S A CUTE WAY OF FIGURIN' AFTER CROSSING US UP... ON THE BIRD CAGE JOB, NEARLY GETTING US ALL KILLED. YOU GOT A CUTE WAY OF FIGURIN' TOO, SENDING THAT POSSE OUT TO RINGO'S. POSSE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT, POSSE? I WENT BACK TO RINGO'S TO GET YOU, LIKE I PROMISED. THE PLACE WAS BURNED DOWN. NOTHING BUT ASHES. WHO DO YOU THINK BURNED IT DOWN? ME? I'M TELLING YOU WE DIDN'T SEND A POSSE UP THERE. WE DALTONS WOULDN'T SEND A POSSE AFTER ANYBODY. THEN HOW DID THEY FIND US ONE DAY AFTER YOU LEFT? ANYBODY DO ANY HUNTIN'? SHOOTIN'? THAT WAS IT. IT MUST HAVE BEEN. MAC AND I DID SOME TARGET SHOOTING. SOMEBODY MUST HAVE HEARD US. NO USE TALKIN', TOM. I'M GETTIN' OLD. IT'S QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR A MAN TO GROW OLD... IN THIS COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY WITH THE DALTONS AROUND. THEY GOT A LOT OF NERVE, PULLING A THING LIKE THAT. IF THEY DID IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN "IF"? I'LL LET YOU KNOW. WELL, NOW. I THINK I'LL HAVE ANOTHER. [ Giggles ] HOW LONG DO I STAY HOLED UP HERE? WHEN THE EXCITEMENT DIES DOWN, MAC AND RINGO WILL COME BACK AND RIDE YOU OUT OF TOWN. HMM. THAT OUGHTA BE QUITE A RIDE FOR ME. [ Knocking ] WHO IS IT? TOM BRADFIELD. JUST A MINUTE. COME IN, TOM. HELLO, MONTANA. I, UH-- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WORRIED ABOUT ALL THAT COMMOTION DOWN THERE. YES. I WAS ASLEEP. IT WOKE ME UP. WHAT WAS IT ALL ABOUT? BOB DALTON GOT AWAY. NO. SEEMS HIS BROTHERS RESCUED HIM. THEY SET FIRE TO THE LIVERY STABLE TO DRAW OFF THE CROWD, AND THEN THEY STUCK UP THE JAIL. THERE'S JUST NO LIMIT TO WHAT THOSE DALTONS'LL DO. WILL YOU SIT DOWN? NO. NO, THANKS. I WON'T WAIT. I, UH-- I'M AFRAID IT MIGHT NOT BE SAFE. NOT SAFE? DIDN'T ANYONE EVER TELL YOU YOU'RE A VERY DANGEROUS WOMAN? [ Chuckles ] IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A COMPLIMENT? IT ISN'T EVERY WOMAN THAT CAN HIDE HER CROWNING GLORY AND STILL REMAIN BEAUTIFUL. [ Chuckles ] THEM'S MIGHTY PRETTY WORDS. I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU. PROPOSITION? HOW ABOUT A RIDE IN THE COUNTRY? NICE OUT THERE NOW. INDIAN SUMMER. WE'LL TAKE A BASKET AND HAVE A GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED PICNIC. PROPOSITION ACCEPTED. MAKE IT SOON. WE WILL. GOOD NIGHT, MONTANA. GOOD NIGHT, TOM. THAT SMOOTH-TALKIN' DUDE. SOMEDAY, I'LL KNOCK HIS HEAD OFF. YOU TRIED THAT TONIGHT. YOU CAN'T GO FOR HIM, BELLE. WHAT ABOUT THAT PROMISE TO GO TO CALIFORNIA WITH ME? NO, BOB. I'M STAYING HERE. WHAT? YOU'RE SITTING ON DYNAMITE. SOMEBODY'LL SPOT YOU, SURE. I'M SORRY. I'VE GOT SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS IN GUTHRIE. YOU THINK TOM BRADFIELD WILL STICK TO YOU WHEN HE FINDS OUT YOU'RE BELLE STARR? TOM BRADFIELD MEANS NOTHING TO ME. WHEN I FINISH MY BUSINESS HERE, I'M LEAVING WITHOUT HIM. COME WITH ME, BELLE. I'LL GET YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT. JUST THINK. CALIFORNIA. LOADED WITH SOFT TOUCHES JUST WAITIN' FOR US. COME ON, DALTON. WE GOT YOUR HORSE DOWN BELOW. WE HAD THE DALTONS ALL WRONG. THEY DIDN'T SEND THAT POSSE OUT TO RINGO'S. THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU? NO. IT'S TRUE. SOMEONE MUST'VE HEARD US TARGET SHOOTING THAT DAY. I WAS AFRAID OF THAT. I WANT YOU BOYS TO SEE THAT HE GETS OUT OF TOWN. WE'LL SEE TO THAT. AND SAFE. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HIM, YOU'D BETTER NOT COME BACK HERE. HE'LL BE SAFE... THIS TIME. COME ON, ROMEO. WAIT. THANKS. IF YOU EVER NEED ME, GET IN TOUCH WITH YELLOW DEER'S PLACE NEAR THE PAWNEE NATION. HIYA, TOM. HELLO, TOM. GOOD TO SEE YA, MATT. I WAS JUST GOING TO TELL MR. RIDEOUT ABOUT YOUR SCHEME FOR TRAPPING THE DALTONS. BUT IT SHOULD COME FROM YOU. GO AHEAD. WELL, YOU SEE, JEPTHA, HERETOFORE, ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY HAS BEEN PAID OUT... THROUGH HALF A DOZEN BANKS FOR GOVERNMENT BEEF CONTRACTS. -YES, I KNOW. -NOW, IT'S MY IDEA, IF WE CAN GET ALL THAT MONEY IN ONE BANK, IT'S JUST THE PRIZE THE DALTONS WOULD BE CERTAIN TO GO AFTER. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO FIND OUT. I FINALLY GOT THROUGH ALL THE RED TAPE. MONEY WILL BE DELIVERED TO MR. RIDEOUT'S BANK HERE TUESDAY THE 11th. - YOU GUARANTEE THE INFORMATION WILL GET TO THE DALTONS? - ABSOLUTELY. I'M NERVOUS. A MILLION DOLLARS IN MY BANK-- FULLY COVERED BY THE BANKERS' PROTECTIVE. BUT IF THE DALTONS DO COME TO GET IT, THERE'LL BE SHOOTING. PROBABLY WILL BE, BUT THAT'S NO REASON THAT YOU SHOULD GET HURT. WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT. WELL, WHAT DO I DO NEXT? TELL THE WORLD ABOUT IT. MAKE A BIG SPREAD IN EVERY NEWSPAPER IN THE TERRITORIES. START PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT. WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT THE BIGGEST DAY IN GUTHRIE'S HISTORY. AND WE WILL. COME ON OVER, MATT. I WANNA TALK TO YOU. SO LONG. SO LONG. A MILLION DOLLARS. WHOO! I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU JUST TALK ABOUT. NOW AREN'T YOU GLAD WE STAYED IN GUTHRIE? DO WE TAKE IT? YOU BET WE DO. BUT WE'LL NEED HELP. WHO YOU GOT IN MIND? THE DALTONS. WHY THEM? BECAUSE WE OWE THEM SOMETHING FROM THE BIRD CAGE JOB. WHERE DO WE FIND THEM? BOB TOLD ME TO CONTACT YELLOW DEER NEAR PAWNEE NATION. I KNOW YELLOW DEER. GOOD. YOU TWO GO AND SEE IF THE DALTONS ARE INTERESTED. IF THEY ARE, STAY WITH THEM UNTIL THE NIGHT OF THE TENTH. I'LL HAVE THE LAYOUT BY THEN, AND WE'LL OPERATE FROM JIM'S PLACE. YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT. WHY? DIDN'T YOU WANT ME TO? OH, IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S JUST-- JUST WHAT, DARLING? IT'S NOT GOOD FOR EITHER ONE OF US. WHY? [ Sighs ] DON'T ASK ME WHY. DO IT AGAIN. TOM? YES? LAST NIGHT, WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO MARSHAL RIPPLE, I HEARD YOU SAY THAT SOON WE'D ALL BE OUT OF DATE. THAT'S RIGHT. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DALTONS. JUST WHAT DID YOU MEAN? JUST THAT THE TERRITORY IS GROWING UP. YOU SEE, IN A NEW COUNTRY, EVERYONE GETS THE FEELING THAT ANYTHING GOES, AND THAT BRINGS ON A WAVE OF LAWLESSNESS SUCH AS WE HAVE IN OKLAHOMA TODAY. BUT THAT SORT OF THING IS GOING OUT, AND SO ARE WE. WHY "WE"? BECAUSE WE'RE PROFESSIONAL GAMBLERS, DARLING. HONEST, YES, BUT ALL PART OF THE ERA. WE'RE GETTING OUT OF DATE TOO. WELL, SUPPOSE-- SUPPOSE WHAT? NOTHING. THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO SAY TO ME, WASN'T THERE? WELL, IT'S JUST THAT I-- IT'S REALLY NOTHING. DARLING, IF YOU EVER DO WANNA SAY ANYTHING TO ME, YOU WON'T BE AFRAID TO COME TO ME, WILL YOU? NO, TOM. YOU'RE THE ONE MAN I'LL NEVER BE AFRAID OF. DON'T YOU THINK WE'D BETTER BE GETTING HOME, DARLING? IT'S GETTING LATE. [ Tom ] WELL, THE HORSE IS GOING JUST AS FAST AS HE CAN. BELLE SAYS TO MEET AT JIM'S PLACE THE NIGHT OF THE TENTH. BELLE SAYS THAT-- "BELLE SAYS." WHAT IS THIS "BELLE SAYS"? IS SHE RAMRODDING THIS OUTFIT? SHE'S RAMRODDING THIS JOB. DO WE KNOW WE CAN TRUST HER? SHE CROSSED US ON THE BIRD CAGE JOB, DIDN'T SHE? I TOLD YOU HOW THAT PLAY CAME UP. NOW, SHUT UP. DON'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP. IF EMMETT DALTON WINDS UP IN A GUTHRIE STREET WITH A BELLY FULL OF .45s, THAT'LL BE ME. I WANNA KNOW WHAT I'M GETTIN' INTO. AND I'M TRYIN' TO TELL YA. YOU DON'T LIKE THE SETUP, JUST SAY SO. EMMETT'S TALKIN' THROUGH HIS HAT. I LIKE IT. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME, EMMETT. ALL RIGHT. COUNT ME IN. BUT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, DON'T BLAME ME. HAPPY? COURSE I AM. WHAT WOMAN WOULDN'T BE WITH YOU, TOM? THIS HAS BEEN THE HAPPIEST WEEK OF MY LIFE. AND YOU'RE A DIFFERENT PERSON. DIFFERENT? IN WHAT WAY? WELL, YOU ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE GUARDING AGAINST SOMETHING. THAT TENSENESS IS GONE NOW. YOU'RE MORE LIGHTHEARTED... AND QUICK TO LAUGH AND, WELL, JUST A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH. I HOPE YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER ME THAT WAY. REMEMBER YOU? WHY, I'LL NEVER LET YOU GET FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM ME TO HAVE TO REMEMBER. YOU'LL ALWAYS BE RIGHT HERE. YOU'RE MY PARTNER, AREN'T YOU? YES. I'M YOUR PARTNER. LET'S DRINK TO THAT PARTNERSHIP-- A PARTNERSHIP WITHOUT DECEPTION, SO IT CAN ENDURE AND BRING HAPPINESS... AND PRIDE TO BOTH OF US. DRINK. TOM, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME NOW.

I COULDN'T BE MORE CONFIDENT IF THE DALTONS TOLD ME THEMSELVES. IN THAT CASE, IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE PAYING YOU $90,000 BEFORE THE DAY IS OUT. - WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT? - WELL, I'M GONNA SHOOT PART OF IT ON THE "RIP-ROARINGEST" MEXICAN HONEYMOON YOU EVER HEARD OF. MEXICAN HONEYMOON. THAT CHARMING PARTNER OF YOURS, I'LL BET. THAT'S RIGHT. BELLE AND I ARE TREMENDOUSLY IN LOVE, AND EVENTUALLY, WE SHOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY HAPPY. BELLE?

[ Chokes ] WELL, THEY NABBED US LAST NIGHT, AND EMMETT WAS GONNA SHOOT HER 'CAUSE SHE TRIED TO TALK HIM OUT OF ROBBIN' THE BANK. THEN BOB, HE WAS COMIN' HERE AND KILL YOU. WELL, IT WOUND UP THAT... SHE PROMISED SHE'D RIDE WITH HIM IF THEY'D GUARANTEE HER THAT THEY WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU. WHERE'S MONTANA NOW? SHE'S RIDIN' WITH THE DALTONS... TO HOLD UP RIDEOUT'S BANK. TAKE IT EASY, TOM.

THE DALTONS ARE SHOT UP, BUT THEY'LL LIVE TO FACE THE JURY. I WANNA KNOW WHO WAS THAT YOUNG BANDIT THAT TOM BRADFIELD TOOK OUT OF THE BANK. THAT YOUNG BANDIT WAS BELLE STARR. BELLE STARR? CONWAY, GET A POSSE MOUNTED. WE'LL RIDE THEM DOWN. [ Groaning ] OH, TOM-- TOM, I TRIED TO-- I KNOW. PETE BIVINS TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT. [ Sighs ] TOO BAD IT HAD TO END LIKE THIS. IT'S NOT GOING TO END.
