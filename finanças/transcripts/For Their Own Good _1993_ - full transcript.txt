(Multicom Jingle) (gentle music) - [Narrator] Although certain characters and incidents have been fictionalized, this film was inspired by an actual event. (horn honking) (people chattering) (upbeat band music) (crowd chattering) - How you doin'? - Hi, alright. (marching band music) - [Man] I think they all look good. I'm glad they're home. Yes, sir. - Hi, mama. - Hi. Well, I just wanted to sneak a peak at you in your uniform, make sure you got home safely in one piece. That's all. - Glad you're here. - I certainly took my chances. Had to figure that your pa weren't gonna show. - I never seen you lookin' so pretty. - Well, you keep talkin' like that, and I'll be cryin' my Mary Kay peachy blush right off my face. - No. Please, mama. Mama, don't. - Sorry, I can't help it. I've been prayin' so hard for this moment, hopin' it would come. All it took was seven years and a war. - There's nothin' you could do, mama. I mean, there's nothin' anybody could do. Are you gonna offer a tired soldier a ride home, or am I walkin'? (laughing) Well, pa didn't write me one time the whole time I was over there. Got 36 letters from you, though. - [Sally] I've still got two in my purse. - [Jody] I can't believe that plant's still standin'. - You look so thin. What's they feed you in Saudi Arabia, anyway? - [Jody] Mama, pull over. I wanna ask you somethin'. - Smack in front of McCade? They see me, they come pourin' outta there like a bunch of porcupines lookin' for a dartboard. - There ain't nothin' they can do to you they ain't done already. One thing bein' over taught me was you gotta look the enemy straight in the eye. - Nobody said nothin' about gettin' outta no car. Jody. Jody. Oh, shoot. - You know, I still have nightmares about what they done to you. - Hey well what's done is done. Ain't nothin' gonna ever change that. - You wanna talk about it? - I can't. I just can't. - Please? I've waited seven years. (emotional music) Well then, if you're not gonna tell me, I guess I'm just gonna have to hold my breath 'til I turn blue. - Well, can't have you turnin' blue, too, can I? You know blue used to be my favorite color. They sure took care of that, didn't they? After I lost you, I didn't think anything could hurt me as bad. But I was wrong. (crew chattering) (machinery clanging) - Hey, Travis, they want you down at the gas Hurley down there at the the tower. - Right. - [Worker] Right in the middle of my work space here. - Y'all take a break yet? - Huh-uh. - Take it now. - [Worker] Now roll that on outside. - 40 pounds too much for you, girl? - [Sally] No, I can manage. - Take a hike, Hank. - You hold them trays away from your hooters when you lift 'em, you hear? You keep touchin' 'em with these compounds, don't come cryin' to me when you get hurt. - You better not get any ideas about touchin' 'em, Hank, or I'll have the union on your butt like a runaway train. - I'm just tryin' to be helpful, girl. - [Naomi] Helpful, my ass. - I cannot believe you talk to him that way. - You just got here. It's only your first week. I used to be a shy flower when I first started, too. He knows damn well nobody, man or woman, can lift 200 trays a day. Just lift them whichever way you can. - Oh, it's okay. Tough enough gettin' this job. I ain't gonna give them any excuse to fire me. (door slamming) - [Clark] Hey. - Dinner's almost ready. (television droning) - What's this here? - That is my very first paycheck from McCade Industries. - $264? - $343.50 before taxes. I can't believe it used to take me a month to earn that much down at the coffee shop. - Shoot, it's $80 more than I made last week. - Oh, yeah? Someday you're gonna own that fillin' station. You ain't always gonna be punchin' a time clock like me. Jody, get in here and turn off the TV, dinner's ready. - Canned hash? - Well, I didn't have time to do shoppin'. I wanted to make you pork chops. - Oh, you know what I think? I think we was all better off when you was still a waitress. Right, Jody? Well, he's your boy, all right. He can't even offer up an opinion. - Don't start with him, Clark, please. (machinery whirring) - [Worker] Shut 'er down. - [Worker] Got it. - Take my sister Laura for instance. She popped a baby every year for the last eight, and I ain't even had one. - Oh, it'll come, honey, when you least expect it. Every time we try, nothin' happens. Every time we didn't, we had one. (woman chuckling) John still wants a boy. Not enough hands to do the chores. What about you, Sally? You want another? - Me, I want a whole house full. Doesn't seem to be in the cards, though, not the way me and my husband have been gettin' on. - Some's got lots of children. Some's got lots of money. Them's got both find somethin' else to complain about. Y'all don't because me, watch Oprah for five minutes. - See it on whose TV? My husband I still savin' up for a used washin' machine. Georgia, quit hoggin' the soap. - Well, there's somethin' the matter with it. - Here, hand it to me. Ah, look at that, you see, they watered it down again. - Yeah, you think they'd let us know we ain't wanted here. - They either bein' cheap or nasty, take your pick. - What they are bein' is disrespectful. - [Woman] Who's gettin' an eyeful this time? - [Woman] Glory be, will you look at that? - Ladies, I think I see a cockroach over here. (women crying out) - I'm so scared. - Oh, my god. (women chattering) - [Woman] I can't believe that, look at that thing. - Sally, come see this roach. - [Woman] I can't believe. I bet it's the new (speaking drowned out) - You ain't afraid of cockroaches, are you? - Scary lookin'. - Come on, Sally. - Ooh. (women chattering) - Come on, you're the new full 'round here. You can do the honors. - Sally, come on over here. - Just take this bottle and squeeze, and holler marry Christmas. - Ooh, oh. - Biggest one I ever saw. - I've never seen a bug like... - Be sure to get it. Right there. - Looked like... - Go on. - Go on, Sally. - There it is. - Yes! (women cheering) (women laughing) - I can't believe I just did that. - You get a gold star. (Sally coughing) (ominous music) - Sally, I want you to quit. - I need a towel. - My god, you're coughin' this crap up all over the place. - I'll clean it up. Naomi says we wouldn't be havin' these problems if we got better respirators. - You wouldn't be havin' this problem if you would quit. Now, you shower off before you come back to bed. I'm tired of you leavin' this mess on the sheets every night. - I could shower from here to kingdom come, Clark. It wouldn't make no difference. People's retired says when you leave the plant, you sweat color for a year. - [Clark] Just do it. (whistle blowing) (crowd cheering) - Go, Jody. - Go, Jody. My god. God, he's gotten so big. - Get him, son. - [Spectator] Come on, come on. - He just flipped him on his stomach, pa. Come on, Jody, pin him. - Put mule in the barn, boy. (whistle blowing) - Looking good! Way to go, Jody! (boy groaning) (whistle blowing) - He's wimpin' out. - He's doin' fine. - He's got nothin' left. He never does when he needs it the most. (crowd shouting) (whistle blowing) (buzzer sounding) (crowd applauding) - It's okay, Jody, it's okay. - I don't wanna hear any more of your lame excuses. You get down on your all fours, quick. - [Jody] Pa, I'm studyin'. - Wait, what are you doin'? - He's gonna learn a thing or two about wrestlin', that's what. - Oh, he ain't got time for this. Jody, you get yourself back to work. You got an English test tomorrow. - You put a lid on it, and you get down now. - Yes sir. - Aw, come on, Clark, don't be ridiculous. - No son of mine is gonna wrestle like a girl. - Ow. - You fight. - Ah, ow, ow. - And you fight like a man. - It hurts. - Stop it, Clark. Don't be ridiculous. - Shut your face. - Clark, please, leave him alone. He's just a little boy. - Learn to fight. - Stop it, it hurts, ow. - Oh, my god, Clark, please, stop it. (fist cracking) (Sally groaning) Jody, you run to Billy's house. - No, mama. - And you stay there. - Clark, get off. - I said to get. - Don't hit her no more, pa. - Go. Now. (lamp crashing) (machinery clanging) - You better put some ice on that shiner. - Will you quit starin' at me like that. You think your husband never laid a finger on you before? - No. And if he ever got any ideas, I'd have no qualms about pullin' his smelly socks above his head, tyin' him up, and smotherin' him to death. Look at you. You shouldn't even be working. - Yeah, well, I ain't got much of a choice, do I? - Yes, you do. You could get rid of that SOB. - Well, it wasn't always this bad. - Well, it's bad now. Sally, we don't have to take it just 'cause our grandmas did. We allowed to be happy, too. - Jody makes me happy. - [Hank] Roy, I said I come down here to talk to you. (speaking drowned out by noise) You've got to take some time off. - [Roy] I was just off two weeks before Easter. - [Hank] Yeah, and the levels have got to be brought down. - Was it lead poisonin'? - No, that's in pavement. They say it's somethin' else, some other kind of compound that's just as bad. Probably worse, if I know them. - You ever get forced leave? - Yeah. They said the toxins was stickin' to my lipstick. - We took care of them levels last time. - They are up. We are gonna deal with it. And you've got to pack it in. Naomi, come over here and take over for Roy on this packer. I need somebody who knows what they're doin'. - Somebody must have treated him real good last night. That's the closest thing to a compliment he paid me ever since I've been here. I'll hop right on it, sweet pea. - Sally. You think you can handle this by yourself? - Yeah. - You know them hooters of yours are lookin' flatter than usual. You sure you haven't been puttin' them compound trays up against them when I ain't been lookin'. - Hey, Hank, that ain't no way to be talkin' to a lady. - You ought to know, boy. You're divorced, aren't you? - That's the second time in a week somebody's bailed me out with that man. Sally Thompson. Thanks go out to you. - Think you better sit out this round. - No, no, no, I can't let you do that. It ain't right. You're gonna get us both into trouble. - I ain't gonna say nothin' to you about it, but I ain't gonna pretend like I don't see what's been done to you neither. - My brother'd still be workin' for McCade if it weren't for that fumb equal opportunity law about hiring women. - No, your brother would still be workin' here if he'd been doin' his drinkin' in the right places instead of on the job. - All I know is, is perfume and compound don't mix. - You know what I think? I think you're raggin' on 'em 'cause you're scared for your own neck. Heck, everybody here knows productivity is up since they was hired on. - Not enough to save this sinkin' ship. I heard there's new talk about closin' us down. - Hell, they've been closin' this place down and movin' this shindig to Mexico since before we was born. - Strawberry rhubarb. Strawberry's frozen, but the rhubarb's fresh. Got plastic knives here, forks, and enjoy. - Well, thank you. Seein' as how you feel about women the way you do, you don't mind if I just hog this all for myself, do you? - Well, what are you lookin' at? Gotta start somewhere. - I love banana cream. (women laughing) - I got news for you. It's gonna take a whole lot of pie to make us one big happy family around here. - Guess what? A mandatory meeting's been called for us women right after work. It's with Dr. Mason. - Dr. Mason? - What's she gonna do, hand out tongue depressors? (women laughing) - After a comprehensive study of compound divisions in facilities across the nation, the findings show that certain substances women are exposed to could endanger a developing fetus. - About time they got us some proper gear. - Therefore, the company has adopted the following fetal protection policy. All women of childbearing years, ages 15 to 60, who work in hazardous areas must undergo a sterilization operation. (women chattering) - Sterilization? - Or be terminated from their current job. - What? - What? - Of course, if you've already had a hysterectomy or have written proof of sterility, there is nothing further required. Dr. Mason here will be happy to field questions if you have any. Thank you. - Oh, no, no, no, no, wait a minute. Do I got this straight? - [Woman] That's not right. - We have to give up our ability to have children so that we can continue to work in this cesspool? - I know this is difficult. - Why don't they just clean up the plant like they're supposed to? - I'll tell you why, because there ain't enough of us workin' here for them to spend the money to make it safe. - Y'all are doin' this 'cause you know we ain't got no place else to go. - My husband uses protection. Isn't that enough? - I'm afraid it's not considered reliable. - Well, what if we go on the pill? - [Dr. Mason] What if you forget to take it? - What if we promise not to sue? You know, sign some sort of agreement? - I asked the same question to our legal people, and there's just too many loopholes. - So what have we gotta do? - Well, the operation is a routine procedure called a tubal ligation. - Routine for who? - You're in and out of the hospital in three days. Recovery period is six weeks. The company will foot the bill. - Well, that's generous. - You have 30 days to make your decision. - 30 days to choose between starvin' to death or havin' a child. Well, that's quite a decision, ain't it? But that ain't really the point, Clark. - I mean, how good's a boy's English gotta be for pumpin' gas? - Well, I know you like workin' at the fillin' station. But maybe Jody wants to do somethin' else? - Good enough for me, it's good enough for him. Right, Miss Gates? - We were talking about Jody's grades. - I wanna see you outside. Excuse us, please. - Of course. - Clark. - I don't care. You contradicted me in front of that teacher of his. - Give up. You and me are turnin' out to be as different as molasses and vinegar. - Oh, what the hell are you talkin' about? - Just forget it. - No, you got somethin' to say, you say it. - It ain't even worth discussin'. It's stupid of me to think you'd even wanna have another child. - You're damn straight, you can put it right outta your head. Comes waltzin' in at six o'clock after some plant meeting like she's got nothin' better to do, and you expect to have another mouth to feed. What's so important they gotta have a meetin' at that plant anyway? - Ain't nothin' that you'd care about. (train chugging) - Well, they got all them doctors and scientists workin' for 'em. What I mean is they must know what they're doin'. - You're kiddin' me. Do you have any idea what you're talkin' about here? - Come on, everybody's gonna have their turn. - Chris, all I'm tryin' to say is it don't matter much to me anymore. I'm gettin' kinda old to have kids, anyway. That's it, I'm done. - Georgia? - It's kind of personal. I don't know if I should be talkin' about it. - Now, come on now, Georgia. Now, nobody's gonna judge ya. - Well, see, Tommy's brother, he's kinda slow. Well, mentally and all. So we decided we wouldn't even try to have kids. I mean, in my heart, I know it's wrong, (melancholy music) but I'm not gonna fight it. - I can't just sit here and listen to this, watch my whole life go down the drain. - Well, then you oughta quit. - And do what? Have a baby and give it up for adoption when we can't afford to keep it? We know there's no work in this whole damn town. We've all looked. I can't believe it was just the other day we was all in here, in this very room, talkin' about havin' kids. - I know. It's like the devil got off the bus on his way back to hell. Sally, we haven't heard from you yet. - You know I was only 15 when I had Jody. And I'll admit, these years have been tough. Yeah, they've been tough on all of us. But I love my boy more than life itself. I can't imagine givin' up my chances to have another, even though children is a sore point with my husband right now. It just don't seem right. - You know what I think? I think they's puttin' one over on us. And I'm gonna find out. See y'all later. - So you remember how nasty things got. How many of you were with McCade during the last strike? - I was there. - Oh, I was. - Well, there are still folks who haven't completely recovered their losses. And there are still folks who are askin' themselves, was it worth it goin' out over 50 cents? - [Woman] Oh, come on. - I think it was. Others think they would have got the increase anyway over time without the help of the union. It's a tough call. - Is this a tough call? - Well, I can't answer that without launchin' a complete investigation. - Well, are you willin' to? - [Dave] It's not me, it's the union. - All right. Is the union willing to? - The union is workin' for you. You should never forget that. - Like the time we lobbied for our own bathroom. We had to use one in another building, nearly half a mile away. How long did that go on, Dave? - A year, and it would have gone on forever, except one of those girls' husbands was a plumber and did it for free. - If you couldn't even get us our own bathroom, how do you expect to help us here. - Yeah. - Right. (women chattering) - 'Cause this is more important. Right, Dave? - Right. (telephone ringing) - Well, they got two jobs available in converters and one in the supervisor's office. But these are all gonna go to those with the highest seniority. - And you know that ain't one of us. - I wish we could move to another town. - Sure, you and everybody else in McCade County. You know they let go of 200 men over at Stone Rivers this mornin'. - How'd you make out with the union? - They workin' on it. - Yeah, well, I was you, I wouldn't go puttin' off the inevitable. Sometimes the company gets a little squirrely, you know what I mean? You come 'ere, I wanna talk to you. Come on. - Is this your idea of a date, Hank? - They're watchin' you. You know there's nothin' you can do or say that don't get back to the big boys in spades. - Well, I'm just fightin' for what's right. - I'm not gonna be able to bail you out this time, Naomi. I ain't. Now, you better get off that high horse of yours before they kick your butt. Let me tell you somethin'. They haven't forgotten all that ruckus you raised about bringin' women into this plant in the first place. Besides, you got a husband workin' the night shift, don't you? - What's Henry gotta do with it? - Slim pickins out there. Hard enough to get one job, let alone two. - Are you threatenin' me, Hank? - No. I'm just deliverin' the message. - You know, I know that English ain't easy, sweetheart. Heck, if it was, we'd all be president. - Did you ever wish you had a different teacher when you was my age? - Of course, we all did. Why? You wishin'? - See, Mrs. Gates ain't from around here. She got a funny way of speakin' and all. I can't hardly understand her most of the time. - Most of 'em in this whole country don't speak the way that we do. But you best listen to what Mrs. Gates tells you. You don't get stuck here the rest of your life like I did. - But I like it here. - I know you do. It's just that I want you to have choices, Jody. It's real important. I don't want you to get backed into a corner like we did. (pot crashing) - Did you get cornered here, Sally? (telephone ringing) - Yeah? It's for you. - Hello? Hi, Paul. What? Oh my. (gasps) No, I'll be right there. I'll be right there. Just stop your worryin' about the medical expenses, all right. I got some rainy day money saved at home. - No, thank you. This is my own damn fault. I didn't put the mat down gettin' out of the shower. - Lucky that sink broke her fall, otherwise it might've messed up that pretty face of hers. - Oh, what do you know about pretty. You ain't seen my face in years. - Mom. You could've done it all over again, would you have had the four of us? - What kind of question is that to be askin' your mama? - All I remember is us bein' poor and wearin' each other's clothes until they was shot, and the two of you never havin' no time to come up for air. Now that all the work's done and everybody's gone their own separate ways, we're hardly a family anymore, except for Thanksgiving. - For every one of the Thanksgivings, I thank God for the lot of you. I wouldn't trade my family off for nothin', especially you. (telephone ringing) - [Staff] Dr. Taylor, report to pediatrics, please. - Hello, Sally. - Dr. Taylor to pediatrics, please. - I'm Mike Yates, I'm Erma's husband. - Oh, that's right. - We met at the plant picnic. - I'm sorry, my memory ain't worth a damn lately. - That's understandable with what's happenin' and all. You just gettin' out? - Gettin' out? No, no, my mama fell and broke her hip. - For a minute, I thought you were a super human, walkin' outta here like that. They're bringin' Erma down in a wheelchair. Of course, she's had some complications. Oh, hey, darlin'. Could you keep her company while I fetch the car? - Yeah. Yeah. (emotional music) Why? - I couldn't see no way out. - But we was just gettin' started. - My husband was one of the men got laid off at Stone River. And Hank's been ridin' me to death. I couldn't take the chance of losin' my job, too. - Oh, Erma, no. If only you just could've held out a little while longer. The union was workin' on this. - Stop dreamin', Sally. There are 500 men in that union. What on earth did you think they were gonna do for 25 women? - Oh. Naomi, we could've talked to them. - [Hospital Staff] Thank you, bye-bye. - What do you mean? But you're not afraid of them. I'm seen you. - [Man] I'm here for an X-ray. - What? They cut your hours in half? How can they do that? No, I understand. It's okay. No, I'll see you at the plant. Okay. Hi, I'm Sally, Sally Thompson. I work over at the plant. - Oh right, I don't have anything to report yet. - Yeah, well, I do. Erma's had the operation. - I'm sorry. I wish I had known. - What have you done? - Well, we're hoping to set up a negotiating committee by the end of the week. And we're still trying to meet with the president of McCade next Tuesday. - Hopin' and tryin'. Look, I appreciate your mighty efforts. But I do not want anyone else to wind up on that table. And if you just dawdle around and let it happen, you're gonna be wearin' this on your conscience like everybody else. (emotional music) - Somethin' the matter, mama? - Train woke me. Lasts more than 10 minutes, that's it. I'm up for the rest of the night. - It was a long one, wasn't it. - Yeah. - Must've been over 200 cars. - You feel like givin' me one of your hugs for no good reason? Go on back to bed. (people chattering) - Hey, hey. There's a face I haven't seen in a while. - Hey, Roy. - How're things goin' at the plant? - So-so. - Hank still ridin' you? You tell me the truth, 'cause I'll take care of that, you know. - Yeah, well. You're beginnin' to look like you never worked at McCade. Your cheeks is pink, not blue like the rest of us. - The doctor says I'll be back any time now. - Naomi'd be thrilled. She don't know how you keep that packer from breakin' down every five minutes. She says the machine belongs in a museum instead of a factory. - Sounds about like me. I'm gonna be 40 in a month. - That ain't so old. - That's plenty old when you ain't much to look at in the first place. So you goin' straight home? - Gas station, then home. - Well, how about gas station, cup of coffee, then home? - Well, got coffee already. - Yeah, I don't see no cinnamon fry cakes in there, though. Benny'd have a batch of 'em up by now. - No, I gotta get home. My husband's expectin' me. - Well, I don't mean to keep you. - Well, I'll best be outta here. See you, Roy. - See you, Sally. - I never thought I'd see the day, a respirator that fits snug against a woman's face. About time. - Girl, I hope you don't think these respirators change things. The policy is still the same. - Why, if we ain't gonna be inhalin' the pollutants as bad? - They're just protectin' themselves. - Come again? You know, I got news for you. Pretty soon, you ain't gonna have to worry about gettin' sterilized anymore. This company's startin' to feel the heat. Unnecessary expenses like these respirators here are gonna shut this place down. (workers chattering) - Want me to help you with that? - No, I got it. - Look, I know you think I disappointed you, but everything's changed around here. - I'm not. How come Marjorie and Georgia ain't come to get their respirators? Where they been all day? Where are Marjorie and Georgia? - Why don't you check the hospital? - Sally. Wait, Sally. - I don't get it. I just, I don't get it. What is goin' on? - They were afraid if they waited 'til the last minute they'd be out on the street with no place to go. - Well, I'm afraid too. In fact, I'm scared to death. But this is my god-given right, Naomi. And I am not about to let anybody take it away. Shoot, even if the union does come up with somethin' now, we ain't got a leg to stand on. Don't they realize that they're just makin' it worse? - They're not makin' it worse. It's the damn company. And furthermore, they all got they lives, Sally. They all got their reasons. They don't need anybody to tell 'em what's right or wrong. - Somebody's got to you, haven't they? You ain't the fighter that I used to know. - Who is anymore? - [Worker] That's 363. (engine rumbling) - Where'd that come from? - [Clark] Bought it. - You're kidding me, what? - [Clark] What you worried about? - You shouldn't be lettin' him drive that thing. He's barely 12. - It's time. - It's against the law. - Since when did you start payin' attention to the law? That's enough, son. - Now, what is that supposed to mean? - It means you're a married woman flirtin' with some stranger outside the supermarket. And don't say otherwise, 'cause a friend of mine from work saw you. - I ain't got time for this. Where is it, Clark? Where's all the money? - [Clark] You're lookin' at it. - You mean to tell me that you spend my hard-earned money on a used dirt car? - [Clark] Hey, it's my money, too. - This is my rainy day money. - You keep houndin' me, you'll see another cent of it. - Jody, come inside and pack your things. - What for? - We're leavin'. - You stay put. - What, you got some confidence 'cause you met somebody and you got a factory job? - And don't forget to pack your school books. - You was plannin' on leavin' all along, weren't you? - That's right, Clark. That's what I was plannin' all along. I was plannin' to just waltz out that door. I was plannin' to have an operation that I never wanted to have. - What are you talkin' about, operation? - Oh, I'm surprised that your friend didn't tell you. (door slamming) - Do you see this here rifle? You ever try to leave and I'll hunt you down, and I'll kill you both. You hear me? - Yes, sir. - Come again. - Yes, sir. - Jody, are you ready? I hope you're in there packin'. Sweetheart. Jody, come on, I need you to get busy. What are you doin'? Come on. - I gotta stay with pa. - If you're goin', go. - Now, you tell him to come with me. I need my boy. - Come on, Jody. Let's go take the car for another spin. - Jody, Jody, what is the matter? - Nothin'. I don't wanna go with you. - Jody, talk to me. - That's all - Why? - I just don't wanna gonna. Now leave me alone. - Why not? - Jody! (emotional music) - You're gonna have to find another way outta here. - I'm gonna be at grandpa's. You can change your mind any time you want to. 'Cause I'm gonna be waitin' there with open arms. (machinery clanging) - Let's go, let's move it. (workers chattering) - Damn. Be faster if I fill these bins with a measurin' spoon. - You know I put you on this here machine 'cause I thought you was experienced. But you've proven me wrong from day one, haven't you? - I can't repair and fill the bins at the same time. It's either one or the other. Take your pick. - Sally Thompson. Come over here and help your friend. - She don't know nothin' about the packer. - Well, she's gonna learn, isn't she? Now, what I want you to do is go up this ladder here, open up that door, and unclog that stuff, let it fall down. Go on. - I'll do it. I've done it 100 times, I'll do it again. - No, you gonna stay down here and catch the blue when it comes fallin' down. Now you get up there. I'll hold the ladder for you. - Is this thing soldered on or somethin'? - Why don't you use some elbow grease? You got elbows, don't you? - Yeah, but I wasn't sure if there was a plant policy against usin' 'em or not. - You know, you two girls are real entertainin'. I'm gonna miss you around here. - Who says we're goin' anywhere? - Well, I haven't seen you makin' any steps towards gettin' yourselves fixed. That's gonna mean somethin' to those men upstairs. (blast booming) - [Worker] Hey, what is it? - [Worker] What happened, how'd she get up there? - You all right? - Yeah. - Now look what you done. You broke my machine, didn't you? You just get up, wash up, and get out. You, too. - I swear, every day that goes by, he gets meaner and meaner with us. They shipped Carolyn outta here to scrub toilets for less than half her pay. - Why? - They said her productivity was way off. Of course, we all know the whole reason was she was holdin' out, tryin' to set an example, like you and me. Now that Chris has had her surgery, there's just us left. Sally, I'm gonna say something, and I don't think you're gonna like it. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna schedule that operation. - Don't do this. - You know, I know when I'm licked. My spirit's all broke. I used to think Hank was just a big bag of hot air, and I could yell my fool head off at him any time I wanted to, and nothin' would ever happen. But now I know he is speakin' for the company. - Now, Naomi. You're all I got. I lose you, I don't know what I'm gonna do. - Don't you understand? They have picked us off one by one. I'm not gonna give 'em an excuse to fire me. I can't afford it. Sally, I'm not gonna end up winnin' the fight but losin' the war. Don't try and stop me. (emotional music) (Naomi sobs) - I ain't gonna. - At least we was both blessed with one, right? Jody'll come around. You'll see. - [Doctor] Sally, I performed a hysterectomy on your grandmother and on your mother for health reasons. But this is a different ball of wax. I just don't see any reason why I should perform a tubal ligation on a healthy woman. There has to be another way out of this. - I don't see one, lest you be willin' to lie for me. - I'm afraid that wouldn't do any good. They'll be double-checkin' anyway. - Well, I'm right down to the wire here. I only got a couple of days left. I can't go back to Clark. Can't go back to 85 cents an hour and support myself. I lose this job, I ain't never gonna have the means to get my son back. Please don't make me beg for this. - Sally, you go through with this, you can say goodbye to havin' children forever. - Well, I'll see you on Friday. I'll make sure not to eat breakfast. (staff speaking faintly) (baby crying) - [Woman] Was it a boy or a girl? - What? Oh, no. No, I didn't have a baby. Where am I? - The maternity ward. I sorry. What'd you have, female problems? - Of a sort. - Probably didn't have any other rooms available. - [Staff] Here we are, special delivery. - [Man] Oh, here, let me see that grand baby. - Here you go. - [Red-Haired Woman] Come to mama. - Congratulations. - This is a golden moment. - Look here, this is your grandpa. - Looky there, looky there. - Is it a boy? - Yes, it is. - Treat him nice. - I will. (melancholy music) - Well, it's behind us now. (engines rumbling) You mean to tell me after what we done, you want us to transfer from compounds to another department? - For your own good. - There's no such thing around here. We did what you wanted, now isn't that enough? - I did not go through with this to get demoted to sweeping floors and converters. - Fine, you want to be harassed, you wanted to be branded as fixed, you just go ahead. You stay here and you're gonna suffer the consequences. - Well correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we already have. (people chattering) (equipment rumbling) - Just gonna take some time for all of us. - What are you doing in here, Miles? - Visiting. - Yeah, well you got your own toilet to visit, so get. - Well, the way I see it, if you're gonna continue working with the men, you ought to be putting out the welcome mat once in a while. - You better leave here in two seconds, or I'm gonna report you. - Oh come on. - Get out. - Like you're gonna get pregnant, huh? - Leave me alone. - Come on. - Get out of here! Miles, leave me alone! - Well now I thought you said this place was private. We were just fooling around. I'll see you later, Sally. - Are you okay? - You tell all the women around you from now on not to go to the bathroom alone. I know that you're really Clark's lawyer, and I appreciate you handling both sides of the divorce. But all I want is my son back. - Sally, I've spoken to him on several occasions, as early as this morning. Each time he's stated he wants to live with his daddy. - That's because he is being forced to. - Now how do you know that? - Because I have been the brunt of Clark's temper for a very long time, and now I'm not there for him to take it out on anymore. - That's right, you're not. So don't go basing the boys expense on your own. Legally, it just won't hold up. - Well legally, what will? - You're gonna have to find another lawyer for that. And be prepared, that's gonna cost you. - Well thank you for your time. - Sally, are you sure you don't want me to drive you? - No, I'm gonna walk. - Oh, somebody's going to the playground again. - It's Jody's birthday today. - Oh how old is he, 11, 12? - 12. - Oh, what you doing for him? - What can I do? - What can you do? You just keep letting him know that you're still around. You do your part, and eventually he'll do his. Okay? Go on, go. - Hey hey, I'm back. - Hi. - Doctor told me walking's the best thing you can do to push them toxins right out of your system. See most people, they'll go right from the plant to their car, and if they got an attached garage like I do, they don't even have to go outside to go inside. Skin don't breathe, and that's bad, that's real bad. So, you mind if I let my skin breathe with you for a ways? - Free sidewalk. - Well that ain't much of an invitation. - A lot happened while you were gone. - Like what? - Come on, Roy. - What? - Well there's no reason to pull my leg about it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, nobody told you? - I don't socialize with anybody from McCade. - Yeah, well if that's true, why are you wasting your time on me? - 'Cause you seem like a good person who's hurting a lot inside. - Separated now. My husband's got my kid. - I know what that's like. - I'm gonna get him back, though. - I got two kids with their mama in Dillard. She don't let 'em come visit. I wasn't much of a husband the first time around. - Which way you going, left or right? - My pickup's back at the parking lot there. (knocking on door) (gentle music) - Jody! Jody, you in there? (knocking on door) Jody? Jody? Didn't you hear me knocking? - Yeah I heard you. - Why didn't you answer me, sweetheart? - Didn't want to. - Thought you might be out celebrating on your birthday. - Well I'm not. - Brought you a present. Ain't you gonna open it? - Alright. - You like it? - It's a catcher's mitt. I'm a an outfielder. - Well I'll exchange it for you. - No, you better go. Pa's gonna be home any minute. - Jody, now you know I want you to come live with me. - I said pa's gonna be home any minute. - I don't care. I can't leave you here, I just can't. I love you too much. - Well I hate your guts, now get out of here! - Jody, you don't mean that. - I said I hate your guts and I don't want to see you no more. Go, get out of here! Go! (melancholy music) (train horn sounding) (machines whirring) - What's all this hide and seek about? - Looks like McCade jumped the gun. Only one other plant besides us has instigated the sterilization policy. - But we was told that everybody was gonna do it. - Maybe, maybe not. We're not so sure anymore. Anyway, I want you to hold off from getting surgery 'til we have a definitive answer. - You know, I'm real glad that you're keeping up on things, Dave, real glad. (door shutting) (gentle music) I think I need a push. - There now. Isn't that almost like a picture perfect postcard? - Here I thought I knew every decent spot around. Fort Stockton to Seguin. - You hunt? - Can't say that I do. - Well you wouldn't know this spot unless you were quail hunting. - I see. You any good at it? - Well, let me put it this way. I believe that I am one of the primary reasons that that bird has grown so plentiful in these here parts. Aw, I just use it as a excuse to get away from it all. See the dawn crack on a beautiful sight. - Yeah. I could see how nothing could get to you up here. Just let your mind glide from one pleasant thought to the next. Except for Winter, I would never want to leave. - You want to sit? - I do. And I don't. - Well, you just let me know when you feel the first snowflake, and I'll take you on back. - If I had known it was gonna be this peaceful, I would've brought my knittin'. - What are you working on? - A sweater for Jody. You? - Key chain or kindling wood, whatever my boy wants to do with it. - [Sally] You miss him? - And my daughter. - They know it? - They got a whole new life now. It wouldn't be right for me to go down there and mess 'em up. - Mess 'em up? They gotta know that you love 'em. 'Cause if they don't, that'll mess 'em up. - I'm not too good at that sort of thing, letting people in on how I feel. - Well how do you know unless you try? - 'Cause every time I do, I ruin things. - For instance? - Like right here. Ever since we come up here, I wanted to kiss you. Well, I feel like there's a blizzard rolling in here real quick. And my hunting abilities being what they are, not only will we freeze to death, but we're gonna starve. So, we better just skedaddle down off this mountain. (horns wailing) (people chattering) - I feel bad. I mean, I wanted to tell him, I just couldn't. - Well it don't make no difference. Stop making a pork pie out of a piece of bacon. - Oh, just everybody knowing a handy operation, except Roy. - Well, you know, if it's meant to happen, it'll happen. What're they wasting good trees on now? - All employees small division to compounds meet 12 o'clock sharp in the plank cafeteria. - Something tells me this ain't gonna be no free lunch. - Our decision to close down the compound division of McCade is by no means a reflection on the high standard of performance by this ambitious workforce. (melancholy music) But it is a sign of the changing times. In the past months, increased pressure from our competitors, coupled with the costly demands for improvements by OSHA, have provided us with no other option but to close. All other divisions of McCade are unaffected by this, so however many of you can be absorbed into those operations will be relocated by our staff and personnel. - You bastards! - You're not gonna get away with this. - You're scum! You're all scum! (yelling) - Let's make no mistake about this. It's because of you women they're closing this department down. (people yelling) - Them sneaky bastards. I bet they know'd all along this was gonna happen. - You know they never cared about what happened to us women in the first place. You think that since we got our tubes tied, they even flinched? They ain't never had no intentions of doing right by us ever. - We thought if we had the operation, we'd have job security. - Erma! - Now we got nothing. - Erma, Erma, wait. - We rolled the dice, we paid the price. - Don't run off like this, talk to us. - It's over, Sally. Don't you see? We got sterilized for nothing. Nothing in the world is gonna give us back our jobs, and ain't nothing in the world is gonna give me a baby. (people chattering) - I'm sorry you had to find out like this. - [Worker] Union ain't doing it, that's for sure. (dog barking) - I need your help on something, and you are the only lawyer that I know. Well you've seen the papers? - I've read all about it. - Yeah well, it's like this. I want to sue McCade Industries. - Who in particular? - The whole damn company. - Sally, this is a small town. Except for a couple gravel pits, McCade runs the show. Every lawyer I know has wanted to take them on at one time or another, but we don't have the power nor the kind of legal staff that's necessary to go against the giant corporation. They know we know it. We know they know it. Why do you think they get away with the stuff they do? - Well, let me know when my divorce papers is ready. - Hold on, hold on a second here now. Now look, I don't want you to let anybody know I gave you this. - ACLU, what is this? - That's an organization that deals in peoples rights. They got lawyers. - What's the 212? - Area code for New York. - New York? Well so you mean to sit there and tell me that there ain't nobody in all of Texas that'll be willing to help us. - Nobody that has half a chance of winning. (cars honking) (siren wailing) (people chattering) - Hey, how about you? Yeah yeah. - [Woman] Taxi. (knocking on door) - Hi, I'm Jo Mandell. - Sally Thompson. - Sally. Why don't you come in and grab this seat before Millie comes in and puts more books on it. - Alright. It's funny, nobody said that you was gonna be a woman. - Nobody told payroll, either. I still get my checks Joseph Mandell. So, I don't mean to make you feel bad, but why didn't you come to us first? - I didn't even know 'til less than a week ago y'all existed. - Did you get the information about the fetal protection policy from a memo? What I mean is did anyone get written notice that they'd be fired if they didn't comply? A company newsletter or anything. - No, I mean I never got nothing like that. - Then how did you know? - We was told. - Who told you? - It was line boss, some doctor they had. - Which one? - What difference does it make? - A lot. To build a case, you need concrete written evidence. - I was sterilized. Is that enough concrete evidence for you? I can't have no more kids. - Sally, don't confuse me with those other people. I'm on your side. But without written proof, it is your word against theirs. - Why don't you just put down that sandwich that you're eating and give me the bottom line? Do you or do you not think that you can go up against a company the side of McCade and win? - I'm not going to lie to you. You have been in my office for five minutes. There is no way for me to know that. - Yeah, well this is a very long way for me to come to hear that. I think we've just wasted each others time. - Sally, wait. Let me discuss this with my colleagues, and I'll get back to you. - Sure, I've heard that before. (meat sizzling) (birds chirping) How's that chicken coming, pa? - If it ain't cackling, it must be cooking. - I know you're gonna get on with Roy. - I remember you telling me that about somebody else once. - Well you been on my case all day. Why? - Chicken's starting to burn. - You're blind, pa, not deaf. - Well you shouldn't have done it. - Don't you say that. I wanted that job, I needed that job. It's just what I had to do to keep it was wrong. Roy's gonna be here any minute. We all need some time off from this gloom. I'll go get the potato salad, alright? Hey mama. You gonna be having dinner with us? - I'll be happy to meet Roy just as soon as you're officially divorced. - Well, have it your way. Oh my god. - I was on my way home on the subway, I guess I missed my stop. - What are you doing here? - I've talked to the union. We've scheduled a meeting tomorrow night at eight o'clock for all the women at Union Headquarters. I hope you can make it. Of course if you have tickets to the ballet, well that's another story. - I'll be there. - Good. - You want to stay for dinner? - Let's win the case first. (engine revving) I'm staying at the Sleep Cheap if you need me. - Alright. (engine rumbling) Hallelujah, kiss the ground! - Oh you look like a 500 watt bulb in a 50 watt socket. What was that? - That was the lady from the ACLU, come to find me all the way from New York City. - Good for you, Sally, good for you. - I can't believe it, we're on our way. - In honor of the occasion. One's for you and another one's for your mom. They're from my yard. You can keep them bottles. - They're so beautiful. You know, if you hadn't said anything, I would've thought for sure they'd come from a professional florist. - According to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited by law. In my opinion, that policy was implemented by McCade Industries in blatant violation of the law. For that reason and that reason alone, I believe you could win and you should win. (laughing and clapping) Okay, but, that doesn't mean you will win. - [Woman] Oh great. - [Employee] Why not? - Now, this is a fact that you are all going to have to face if you decide to enter into this lawsuit. And believe me, it's gonna be a long one. It will test the strength of each and every one of you. The opposition will dissect you under a microscope and come at you with everything they've got. Plus more. So, I wish that you would talk this over with one another and let me know what you want to do. - She's a lot of talk. But I'm willing to reserve judgment. - She's nothing like us. - Maybe that's good. - You didn't like her when you first met her. - But she come down here out of her own accord. How many of us would have done that, huh? Especially since we ain't paying her a red cent. - Y'all I don't know. My husband still works at McCade. I don't want to jeopardize his job, word of this gets out. - Well you ain't gotta go through with this if you don't want to. Ain't none of us gonna hold it against you. We all got our reasons for doing and not doing things. So, is she gonna be our lawyer, or ain't she? (knocking on door) You can go ahead with it. - Come on in. Okay let's go back. When did you start in compounds? - It was in March. - That's not gonna be good enough. I need the exact date. - I don't know. - It says here March 18th. - March 18th. - Who was your supervisor? - Hank. - Hank Smith, Hank Schwartz, Hank who? - Just Hank. I don't think any of us ever knew his last name. Who'd want to? - Well, the McCade attorneys among others. Now look, I know this seems like little stuff, but in order to be a credible witness, you've got to be able to answer these questions accurately. So, here's your employment record. Your personal file. Take them home, study them. Names, dates, places, conversations. - Okay. - And Sally. Whatever you do, don't panic. I grade on a curve. - Really cool. That last question. Remind me never to vote for Ronald Reagan again. - You did fine. She did fine. You ready? - Ready as I'll ever be, I guess. - This is a deposition. You are not on trial here. If you get nervous, you just imagine these guys in hula skirts and low coconuts. - Miss Thompson, have you ever had a sexual relationship with anyone besides your husband while you were still married? - Objection, this is an invasion of privacy. This is highly prejudicial, and I am instructing the witness not to answer the question. - Have you ever used birth control? - Yes. - For how long? - From the time Jody was born. June 12th, 1972, until I left my husband on April 23rd of this year. - May I ask the reason why? - Why I left my husband? - No, why you used birth control. - 'Cause he didn't want no more kids. - Just your husband, Miss Thompson? - Objection, the witness has already answered the question. - It's true, is it not, with or without this operation, you have no current expectations of having any more children, given the nature of your personal relations. - Objection. - What does he mean by that? - We've spoken to a number of men at the plant, Miss Thompson. Now they allege that you've been carrying on with at least two of your coworkers in the women's bathroom. - Objection. You are badgering the witness. - At the plant, and in front of the market. Come on now, Miss Thomspon. - That is a stone cold lie, and you know it. - I have no further questions. - [Lawyer] Don't volunteer any of it. - So. - I can't talk right now. - What's the matter? - I just gotta be alone. - What happened in there? - Nothing. - Well nothing sure made you awful mad. - What is it that you want from me, Roy? (gentle music) - I want to spend the rest of my life with you. - Why? - 'Cause you got them bushy eyebrows, like two little caterpillars go like that. 'Cause if you can stand up after all they've done to you, then maybe some of that's gonna rub off on me. - This is a picture of the lunch room. If you can call it that. That's my work station. Right there. It's kind of hard to see with all that blue. Our bathroom. Otherwise known as the beauty parlor, where we tried to make ourselves glamorous at the end of the day. Of course, when you only got two sinks, no hot water. For all the women to use at once. Ended up going home like that wicked witch most of the time. - I think I've seen enough. Thank you. These are really gonna help a lot. - So here I am. - I think I've found a problem. - Well you didn't call me over here to watch you fix your car, did you? - Sorry I couldn't get over there. You did not get that from me. (crickets chirping) (knocking on door) - This is a list of all the pollutant levels from everybody in compounds. Goes back five years. Now I ain't much of reading this stuff, but Roy says that all the levels are way over the top, which means if they were gonna bother to sterilize the women, they should've sterilized the men, too. Don't ask me how I got it. - Of course I'm gonna ask you how you got it. - Well I can't tell you that. - You asked me once if I could win this case. I can't do it alone. - Somebody gave it to Roy. - Somebody isn't gonna quite do the trick. - He didn't tell me who. - Would you ask him for me? Please? - You know, you get to go back to New York. We still gotta live here, you know? - Sally, we need a witness, desperately. (gentle melancholy music) - You know, you ain't gotta tell me if you don't want to. I ain't gonna hold it against you or nothing. You stuck your neck out far enough already. (car whirring) (gentle country music) (bell dinging) Well I asked him. - Yeah? - Didn't seem to do much good. Just sort of stood there all quiet-like, staring up at the blank sky. Finally went to bed, didn't even say goodnight. - Well, thanks for trying. - Yeah, I see we made the McCade Courier. Front page. - Washington and New York papers, too. - Holy cow, they gonna run us out of town. - Yeah, let them try. - Thank you. Tell me. Is everybody from New York as fearless as you? - You should meet my mother. She grew up dishing it out in a rough neighborhood. - She must be awful proud of you, being a lawyer and all. - Actually, she's still upset my piano lessons didn't pay off. No, she made a lot of sacrifices for me. But, nothing compared to what you did. - You think I made a big mistake. Don't you? - I did, at first, before I came down here, but now I know you did what you had to do. - Well, hearing you say that don't make it better, but it does take a little bit of the sting away. - You want some cold toast? - Well no wonder you're so tiny. You never eat nothing. - It's too hot out. - What is Roy doing with him? I shouldn't even be on the same planet with you, let alone talk to you. - Suits me. Weren't my idea to come here, anyway. Only reason I took that file is 'cause I just got my walking papers yesterday myself. - Well you can keep on walking. - Miles, we really appreciate your contribution. Don't we, Sally? - Yeah, we appreciate it. - Yeah, I mean shoot. I heard talk they've been thinking about phasing out that compound division for the past five years anyway. - What? You heard that and you never told us? - Well none of us thought any of you would go through with it. We thought you'd quit first. - You thought wrong. - They said if any of you had a defective baby, you'd sue the pants off McCade, so they had no choice. - No, we had no choice. - Settle down, Sally. - Alright. - Off the record, nobody there wanted you women working at the plant. - I'm gonna need you to say that on the witness stand. - Now you listen here and you listen good, both of ya. You don't have to be employed at McCade for them to mess up your life. Now they rule this town, and they rule this county. You can just forget about me being a witness. - Excuse me, Jo. What happened to that file that Miles took from the office? The one you was gonna use as evidence in court. - Oh that. If I remember correctly, I think I sent that off to New York for our attorneys to review. - Hey that was for your use and your use alone! That weren't for no other lawyers! And that weren't for no trial. This is the last time I do anybody a favor. - Oh I don't know, Miles. I think if you search real deep, you still got one more favor left in you. God, I hate him. I hate him. - Sally. We got our witness. (laughing) - We got our witness. - We got our witness. - We got our witness. - We got our witness. (women chattering) (laughing) (upbeat dance music) - Hey. - I'm gonna teach you something about Texas. - What? Oh no, I'm going back to New York. - No you're not. (laughing) - Alright go on, get in line! (all chattering) Jo, get in line. - What do I do? - Hips, hips. (women chattering) You have it, girl. - Go to the right, y'all. Left. (country music) Left and right. âª Arrest a man on the low âª âª He said you gotta get the rhythm of the island âª (cheering and laughing) âª Help me carry my load âª - Okay, right! - Left, right. Left, right left right left. (laughing and chattering) - I thought the song was gonna go down. (laughing) - Yeah. - Oh yeah. - What a great idea. - What's the matter, Jo? - This is absurd. - What is? - We gotta get a new judge on the case. - Why, who'd they stick us with? - Lucas Conner. - Lucas Conner? When we were in grade school, he used to pull the wings off of flies. - He's about as McCade as you can get without actually punching in. - Miles is gone. - Oh my god. - His phone's been disconnected. I went to his house. His neighbor said he split with a bulging suitcase. - Oh great. Our one and only witness. - Probably just paid him off. - Yeah, send him to Argentina. - Yeah, but we're alright. We're alright, ain't we Jo? - It's just gonna be a little harder now. I needed Miles to help clear something up. - Like what? - I've heard talk that some of your ex-husbands and boyfriends are going to testify against you. - About what? - That some of you have been sleeping around. - You gotta be kidding me. - I know. - Who are they claiming? - So far, Chris and you. - Nobody has touched me, not even my own husband since the surgery. (engine rumbling) (doors slamming) - I got the signed divorce papers right here. That makes you a free man and me a free woman. This is the man I'm gonna marry. This is the man that you're claiming I'm sleeping around with, but ain't, because he is too much of a gentleman. And Clark, if you so much as step one toe inside that court house, I'll make your life so miserable you won't know what hit you. - I'll tell you what'll hit you. - Listen to me good now, mister. You ain't never gonna harm this woman again. - You can have her. She's spayed, anyway. - Roy, don't. My boy is in there. - Don't you get any ideas about getting him back. - Jody, Jody! (door slamming) Jody! - Don't even think about it. (knocking on window) (rock music) - Jody! Jody, I know that you can hear me darling. Jody, no matter what happens, I ain't never gonna give up on you. I love you, I always will. (tapping on window) You mean more to me than anything in this whole world. - Come on, Sally. Come on. I'll take you home. (rock music) - That's the offer. Take it or leave it. - The offer? It's not for me to decide. - I strongly recommend that you make it clear to your clients if they decide to go further with this, if they elect not to settle out of court, even if they win, they stand to wind up with nothing in their pockets. - Would you like to explain that? - Well, if they proceed to trial, and the case is decided in their favor, but the judge awards them $250,000 or less, your clients are responsible for all legal costs. - And trust us, there's a real possibility of that in this case. - This is coercion and you know it. - $250,000 is a lot of money to throw away. - $250,000 divided among all those courageous women is no compensation for what they went through. - It is in West Texas. - How would you know? More than anything, I want a victory here. I want you all to have your day in court. Because you put your lives on the line, McCade is now in the spotlight. Every one of you has contributed valiantly to this end, and I'm so proud. (gentle music) Unfortunately, the kind of victory we were hoping for here doesn't always come in a single dose. Sometimes it comes in smaller victories over time. So I can't, in my heart of hearts, tell you not to accept this less than generous offer because there are no guarantees. If it was entirely up to me, I'd stay and fight. But I go home to my job when this is over. And although this money is not enough to change your lives, it will provide for you during these tough times and perhaps give you comfort in knowing that you have made a difference. - Thank you. - Much obliged. - Don't feel bad. I know you did your best. - Thank you. - Come on, let's go. We need to get on with our lives. - We ain't never gonna get what we want. Might as well just take this. (gentle music) - Well, $14,000 settlement ain't a lot of money, but it might buy some peace of mind, if that's possible. You sure picked a hard bargain caring about me after all that's come down here. - If I had my way, I'd pack you and your boy up, take you so far away from here, your shadow couldn't find you. You ain't done with this thing yet, are you? - To tell you the truth, I honestly don't know. But I got this anger inside, and I just don't know what to do about it. I gotta let it out. But I pray when it happens, it ain't let out on you. - Don't you worry about it. If you've got to dish out, I can take it. - I love you, Roy Wheeler. You sure must be eager to get home. - Hm, I've been away so long. I hope my husband recognizes me. I'll be like, hi honey, it's me, Jo. - I want you to have this. (gentle music) It's just a small token of appreciation. It's a baby quilt. I made it for Jody when he was born. - I can't keep this. - Oh no, it's just a quilt. Nothing compared to what you gave to us, to me. If it hadn't have been for you, we wouldn't have had a voice. I would've just given up. Pretty soon we've been forgotten about. I wouldn't have had the strength to fight 'em alone. - Oh yes you would. You are a much more fearless woman than you think you are. - Well. We sure started something here, didn't we? - Yeah we did. - You better get going. You know that meter's running. Bye. My name is Sally Wheeler. (gentle music) I am writing you on behalf of a serious injustice that has forever changed the lives of my ex-coworkers, my dear friends, and myself. On March 30th, 1984, the women working in the compounds division of McCade Industries, Grift Texas, were forced to undergo a sterilization procedure to keep their jobs. It is now nearly seven years later, and little has changed. There is still no law on the books forbidding this heinous crime against humanity. How many more women will have to live in fear each day that their birthrights might be taken away? How many more women will have to suffer the consequences until total justice is done? I know it's too late for us, but it's not too late to close the book on this terrible mistake. Please, put an end to fetal protection policies. With all respect, Sally Wheeler. Thank you. Anyway, nothing more to tell, Jody. It's funny, I promised myself if we ever got back together, I wouldn't go on about the past. So much for promises. - I let you down. I wasn't there for you when you needed me. - Don't you think that way. I got through it. I wasn't alone, I had Roy. - Well you had me too. I wanted to go with you, mama. I really did. But he was gonna kill you if I ever tried. Kill me too if I ever told you. - No. You lived all this time with that? (gentle music) Here I thought I went through something. How can I take your hurt away, huh? - Just be my mama now. (phone ringing) - [Nurse] Dr. Seebers to radiology please. - Hurry up Roy. - I'm right behind you. - Good evening. - She's so beautiful. - Hi. Hey Sally, hey Roy. - Oh hi. - Here she is. - Come here, come here. Hi. Mama, your granddaughter wants to meet you. (gentle music) (baby weeping) Thanks Roy. We're so lucky. - [Roy] Guess that makes me a grandpa. (gentle music) (steady instrumental music) (Multicom Jingle)
