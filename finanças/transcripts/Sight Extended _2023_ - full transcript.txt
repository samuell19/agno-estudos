What do you want? - I don't know. - Patrick, we've talked about this, this mindset of failure it's not serving you well. One must set a goal and proceed with... with what? - Persistence persistence persis - Exactly!

You have to own up to your actions and learn from them. Now, I can't help you unless- - Can't help me? What do you mean can't help me?! - Patrick? Listen- - You call that confidence? You call that courage? Having a panic attack in the middle of the street and crying like a pathetic loser? That's progress to you? - Patrick you need to calm down. - I've been in this bullshit group for three months now. I'm listening to your bullshit babble. I'm taking your bullshit pills and where did it get me? The same place I started. I mean, look at the sorry ass group. Bunch of losers, all of you! - Patrick! - No, I'm done with this shit!

I know you're probably a little bit freaked out by just me being here. Patrick, you're 100 percent right. This umm... This support group it totally sucks ass. I mean, what? [Laughing] They tell you "we're here for you" and then they make you feel guilty like it's your fault when you fail. - Yeah. They can really twist the knife. - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you don't need to be lectured. Just need some guidance. - So why do you go to all these meetings? - Let me ask you something... You umm... You play a lot of video games, right? How come it's so easy for you to fight aliens and monsters in a photo realistic environment, yet completely unbearable to talk to a real person Or to even walk a few miles from your house? - Yeah, but there's a difference between playing video games and real life. - Hmmm... Must there be a difference? Ok, all right, just hear me out. Patrick, what if I told you you could get rid of your anxieties. Get rid of all your inhibitions, your procrastinations, your indecisions... what if I told you that right now, you could walk out that door freely. Talk to people. With confidence. Be successful. Be popular. And best of all, with no drugs. You'd want that, right? - Yeah, sure. - Hmm... Good. [Key dangles] Take it. - What is that? - Refresh. Use that key it will take you there. - Refresh? - Refresh. - What's refresh? - You asked me why I come to these groups. Patrick, that's why. I'm here to show people like you people who are about to give up, that there's a way out. This app is like hitting the refresh button. It's completely free and let me tell you, it's life changing. - I'm sorry, I don't Know... No Offense to you, but I'm really not into all these health apps. [Laughing] - Trust me. Trust me. It's not a health app. But, you know what? it's fine, I don't wanna push you into anything that you don't want to do. So I guess I will see you at the next group Ah? and let me know how far you get in King Nuclear. [Water running] [Water stop running] [Sigh] [exhaling] [Interface sound effects] - Ok...

Wait, but you have a ton of pills. - The ones I needed weren't there. - Jesus Christ I should have known. So what did you do? - Well, I went outside looking for a pharmacy. - Outside?! - Things got a little out of hand, but I'm OK now. - You know you can't. I swear it's one crisis after another. I'm coming back. - No, no need. - What are you doing? [mumbling in background] Patrick, wait a minute. - We're not stopping at Reno, we're heading straight back. - No, I'm fine.

Wow Patrick. - You know, there's a new coat rack right there, right? - Well, I see there's a lot of new things around here. - Yeah, I tidied up the place a bit. - A bit? [Laughing] Well, it looks great! .. And so do you! - Thanks. Hey, what's with all this? - Forget that. What's with all of this? - What? - The house... The hair, the clothes, the car, you being outside?! You realize I almost lost my shit when I came in and you weren't here. And why don't you answer my calls? - Yeah, I guess I just felt cooped up. Felt like I needed some fresh air... Only saw your call after I finished running. - What is the matter with you?! Since when do you even go out for a run? [Sigh] I come back you're this totally different person. I ask you what's going on and you're bullshitting me? Oh my god, are you in trouble? Why would I be in trouble? [Sigh] Patrick, I know you. You seem all glowing and that's great, but we both know how you can get absorbed into things. [Sigh] Where do you even come up with the money for all this shit? Come on! What is it? What did you get yourself into this time? Huh? A new pyramid scheme? Online gambling? A new drug? - Are you serious? - What's refresh? - None of your business - Excuse me? - I said it's none of your business! - Patrick... [Sigh] Look, I'm a little bit overwhelmed right now, but it's only because I worry about you, Ok? I mean... All this new stuff, I know you can't afford it with what you make. - Oh. you worried that your piggy bank of a brother is going empty? - What? - Let's face it Angela, what you're really worried about is not being able to keep borrowing money from me. - How dare you? I do your shopping, I cook for you, I run your fucking errands! Have you ever stopped to think how your messed up life is affecting me? I can't even take one week off without you having a crisis. You're talking about some petty cash I owe you? - Angela, dear. You did some shopping for me last May. Frozen pizza doesn't count as cooking and you left for Burning Man four weeks ago, Not one, four weeks ago. And remind me, who ends up paying for your trips? So let's not pretend it's you taking care of me. And it's fine. I'm taking care of myself. - You're such an ungrateful asshole. You think you can take care of yourself? Fine. - Angela, come on. Look, I don't... I don't want you leaving like this. [Sigh] Look, I'm sorry. I appreciate everything you did for me. Really, really, I do. But now... After years of struggles, I finally feel normal again. You don't have to worry about me anymore. Isn't that what you've always wanted? - This isn't you, Patrick. - You're wrong. For seven years, ever since mom and dad died, I have not been myself... Until now. [Door slams] [sigh] [Alarm clock] [sigh] She likes cats... Really in the post reality art.. Has a master's degree in art conservation. [Pills rattling] [Sigh] You got this. [Laughing] [Wow] - Patrick? - Emily! Hi. - Hi to you. - You look well. [Laughing] - Just well? - Incredible, I mean... Incredible. - I'm just messing with you. [Laughing] Isn't it beautiful? - Out of this world. - That reminds me, Come on. There's no line, awesome! Ok, look at the sky. What do you see? - I don't know... Stars? And if you were to look at them for a while, you'd start to get a sense of movement, Right? [Soft humming] - Oh cool, like a time lapse. Now, imagine that we could see two billion years in the future. [Stars humming] That's when you realize how rapidly the universe is expanding. [Stars stop humming] In two billion years, If someone were to look up, all they'd see would be this. All the other stars would be so far away we wouldn't even know they exist. We'd think we were all alone in the universe. abandoned... [Laughing] - Thanks for showing me this cool, not at all depressing art installation. [Laughing] - Shut up! It gets better, I promise. Of course, if we can see into the future, we can go backwards. Imagine we could see the moment of creation itself. [Starts humming intensely] - Why is it so dark? - In the beginning it's always dark. - What is that? - Everything. All Condensed into this single grain of matter. [Laughing] It's beautiful, isn't it? - Amazing. [Laughing] - I told you you'd like it. Come on. So he finally admits it, not that he had much choice after I caught him red handed. - So what did you do? - What did I do? I told him to go fuck himself and I moved out. Can't believe I was 3 years with that cheating asshole. - He's an idiot. I'm sorry, I can't imagine anyone doing something like that to you. - That's really sweet Pat. Anyway, I... found my own place, finished my degree and decided that from now on I will fill my world only with things that I love. - Is that why you became an art conservator? Hell, yeah. [Laughing] - You're lucky you know. Not a lot of people know what they want to do with their lives Most of us just... go with the flow. [Putting glass down] - What about you? - What do you mean? - I mean, I've been babbling about myself all night. What about you? What have you been up to since high school? - Uh, I don't know. Umm... Let's see... After high school, I took some time off to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Then something... ...terrible happened. That had a huge impact on me. - What? - What happened? - Forget it. It's depressing you don't want to hear about this. - Come on Patrick! I just told you about how my ex-boyfriend for 3 years cheated on me behind my back. shields down. - 2 years after our graduation, my parents died in a car accident. I was in the back seat. - Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I woke up 9 days after the funeral... I Was 2 months in the hospital with 5 broken ribs, punctured lung, collapsed kidney... [Sigh] Then spent the next 7 months at home recovering. - That must have been devastating. How do you recover from something like that? - Thing is, after almost a year recovering, I noticed something changed in me. I- Suddenly the thought of going outside made my heart race and my palms sweat. I started having panic attacks every time I went outside. It kept getting worse and worse, till eventually I stopped going outside. - You mean like agoraphobia? - Yeah, exactly. - Well, you got through it eventually, right? I mean, just look at you now. - Did you know... I had the biggest crush on you in high school? [Laughing] - Really? I Had no idea. - Bullshit! You knew damn well! I call bullshit. [Laughing] - Ok Ok, I might have suspected a little. - So how come you never said anything? - I don't know... maybe I was waiting for you to say something. Say... What color are your eyes? - Blue. [Laughing] - Really? You can barley tell with the contacts. - Why do you ask? - I want to see the real you. - What do you mean? - I mean... [Laughing] I want to see the true Patrick. - I... I think they're trying to signal to us that they want to close up the place. - For the record, this is me saying something. - I umm... - Still too scared to make a move? That's too bad. You're right, it's getting late. - Emily wait! These lenses... they're like a guardian shield to me, you know? I can't just take them out like that. - I did. - That's why you're way cooler than me. - Good night Patrick - Do I get to see you again? - You want a second chance? - Yeah, very much so. - Well... I am going to the reunion tomorrow. Pick me up at 7? - You got it. [Panting] (Emily) Oh... (Emily) Mmm... Patrick Oh Patrick [Moan] [Patrick moans] [Sigh] [Alarm clock] [Sigh] - Oh, hi Emily. Wow, you look amazing. Oh, thanks. It's a.. It's a new sports jack. [Laughing] Sorry about yesterday. [Panting] I guess I just wasn't ready for that. [Panting] [Sigh] But now I'm ready. Here... [Sigh] Now you see the real me. [Purchase sound] [Humming] Perfect. [Glitch sound] What the hell? Oh my god! What the fuck?! [Thump] [Groaning] [Breathing heavily] What the hell just happened? [Turning the water on] [Groaning] wait- Where is Refresh? [Breathing heavily] Oh... Oh no. Oh god, no. [Breathing heavily] You have reported this app as malicious, it is now been blocked and removed from your Sight? What?! [Heart beat rising] Angela! What the fuck? [Breathing] I'll kill her. [Ring tone] - Hello? - Are you insane? - What? - You fucking reported it?! - Are you OK Patrick? I can hardly understand you. [Heart beat rising] Hello? - You blocked me out! - Are you talking about Refresh? Thank god I did. - Thank god?! Angela, do you realize what you've done? - Do you realize what you have done? [Pills rattling] Hello? Are you there? - What I have done? You just ruined my life did you know that? - Wrong! I just saved your life. Did You know your account was in 20,000 credits overdraft? - You logged into my bank account?! - I was worried about you! and I knew there was something fishy about that app. Do you know how much money you were spending through Refresh? - Who cares! It's my money and I can do whatever the fuck I want with it! - If I wouldn't have stopped you now, you would have found yourself living on the streets in a month! - Stop trying to control my life you manipulative bitch! - Patrick! [Patrick hangs up] [Breathing heavily] [Incoming call] Oh shit... Oh shit! [Breathing heavily] Alex! - My dad was like, oh, you're so negative, you're not even trying I'm like, you don't understand how it feels- - Where's Alex? - Patrick? - Where is he? I need to talk with him. - Wow wow, slow down. What happened to you? - Fuck that! How can I contact Alex? - Excuse me? - Alex, Tall, dark, charismatic has fucking good taste in suits. - Look, I don't know what this is Patrick, but you cannot barge in here like this. - Why is it always so hard to get a fucking straight answer from you?! - That's it! I want you out of here now! - Oh, gladly. Just give me his contact info and I'll be on my way. - Who the hell are you talking about? There's no one in the group named Alex. You know that. Of course there is, he used to sit right there. [Sigh] - Look... Patrick, I don't know where you've been in the last month, but you're not making any sense. So why don't we talk about it in private after the session's over. Ok? - Wait... The slick talker with the fancy power suit? - Yeah, you know him? - Well... Yeah. Well, he presented himself as James when he approached me, but yeah, I know "him". - Wait What do you mean, "him"? [Laughing] - He's a sales bot. You know that, right? [Sigh] - Sales bot? [Breathing heavily] - Yeah, he spammed me a couple of times. Tried selling some sort of a makeover app or some shit. But I got rid of him once I upgrade my firewall. - Wow, you're telling me there's a scam bot running inside of my group? How come I didn't know about this? [Sign] It's not a scam. - They're probably programmed so that you won't be able to see them. But like I said, if you're firewall's up to date, you shouldn't have any problem. [Sigh] - Patrick have you been talking to this scam bot? - It's not a scam! - Oh Patrick, tell me you haven't bought anything from them. - You don't understand. It's not a scam. It's the best thing that's ever happened to me. - Really? I mean, look at you. These people, they prey on the weak. It's not your fault. - Fuck You! [Heart beat racing] [Incomig call] [Pills rattling] [Ringing continues] [Catching breath] [Answers call] Hi. - Hey, I've been trying to c ll you, where are you? - Um. Yeah, I know, I know. I was just about to head your way. - Now? - Yeah, yeah. I-I just hit a small snag. - You sound weird, Patrick. Are you trying to bail on me or something? - No, no, no. I just- - You know what? Never mind. I called to tell you I'm already halfway there. You do whatever you want to do. - No, hey, I'll be there. I promise. [Breathing] I'm leaving now. - Really? - Yes, really. - Just... don't disappoint me, Ok? I won't. [Call ends] [Door slams] Hey, sorry I'm late, I... [Cars honking] [Pills rattling] [Swallowing pills] Hey Emily, wow! You look good... Ah... Great, great, great. I mean great! [Sigh] I need to talk to you about... about yesterday. [Cars honking] I want you to know that I'm ready for you to see the real me. About yesterday... Yes [Cars brakes and horns] I know. about yesterday... I want you to know that I'm already... [Puking] [Sigh] [Club music] [People chatting] - Oh look. - Hey! [People chatting] [People mumbling] - Hey - Emily! Patrick? - Wow! - Watch out! - There you are. - Oh my God, Patrick, what happened? - Is that puke on your shirt? - Can we go somewhere to talk? - Patrick, you need to go to the hospital, get this sewn up. [Sigh] You might have a concussion. - Forget about that now. [Sigh] I... I really need to talk to you about yesterday. - Oh dude, that's gross. - Oh! I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I...I think I have a tissue here somewhere. - Hey, it's OK. Ok? Look, I'm going to go get this cleaned up and then we're going to go to the hospital together, OK? - Ok. - Ok. Zack, I'm so sorry about this, I'll call you okay? - Ok. - I just want you to know I'm not afraid anymore. - What? - Here. [Zack laughing] - Dude, what the fuck man? [Laughing] Wait... Patrick? Oh my god, I remember you now. Weren't you in that nerdy computer club? Umm... Look man... That cut looks pretty deep, I don't think you should wait around for her, you know? - What? - How about I call you a cab? - No, I'm not getting up until she comes back. - Ok, umm... [Laughing] You're starting to freak everyone out and umm... Worse than that, you're ruining it for someone who might actually have a chance with her. So... [Groaning] [Laughing] Ok seriously? [Laughing] Alright, come one. - Get off me! - Dude! What the hell? - She'll... She'll see that I'm strong. That I'm not afraid to make a move. - Wait, do you think that she actually likes you? Dude... you were bothering her. She's being nice because she pities you. - Shut up. - No, no. You saw the way that she reacted to you. She thinks you're a freak. I mean, look at you. You are a freak. - Shut up! [Crowd gasping] - Wow! [Roaring] [Groaning] - Come on! [Groaning] - Take your fucking hands off me! Let go of me! - Zack, What are you doing? [Glass breaking] [Crowd panicking] [Ominous music] [Ominous music] [Ominous music] [Door opens] [Door closes] - I'm Administrator Malloy. Do you know where you are, Patrick? - I, uh... In... In jail? - No. Not jail, not yet anyway. You're at the Parabelle Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center. Do you know why you're here? - I... uh... - You've been arrested for DUI and assault with a deadly weapon That guy you caved his skull in, Zach, I believe his name was... Is Still in a coma. That could mean 3 years in prison for you. [Breathing] But I don't see any past felonies. Up until now your record was completely clean. Your psychological profile doesn't show any violent tendencies. You might just be a good candidate for this new program. - New program? - You see Patrick, prison is a hostile environment. I've seen many young men like you and quite frankly, your kind don't do very well in prison. In fact, many don't make it out at all. This new program is... unconventional, but it might just make your time away from society more... productive... bearable... even transformative. It could cut down on your sentence significantly... Depends on how well you play along. - What I have to do? - Just sign these, [Paper movement] and we'll take care of the rest. [Signing] [Ominous music] [Electric pulse] [Prison embiance] [Keys rattling] [Opening lock] - You have 20 minutes [Door opens] - Patrick. - Angela! [Laughing] I'm so happy to see you! - Oh [Laughing] - Here, have a seat. [Moving chair] - Wow. [Laughing] - This is a... This is the palace. - Yeah. [Sigh] You look good. [Laughing] - Thanks. [Sigh] - Listen, I'm... I'm sorry it took me so long to come and visit, it's just that... Eagle eye had some... issues with the law last month and I've been strapped for cash and I kind of... was afraid- - It's ok Angela - No. When you called me... and what happened after, I keep thinking, if only I had- - It's OK Angela. I'm not mad at you. To be honest, I'm feeling very well. - You are? They treating you ok? - Yes. In fact, I even get to keep my Sight. I have a nice routine here. Plenty to do. It gets a little repetitive but they have a way of keeping things interesting. [Video game sounds] After all this time, keeping myself locked away in my apartment, I have to tell you that being locked away here feels almost strangely liberating. [Video game sounds] The agoraphobia is gone. I felt so alone all this time. Suddenly I feel like I'm part of something. Everyone here is just like me. There's no social media, no one to impress, no paralyzing decisions, just... living in the moment. I do my workouts, I eat well, I follow instructions. Obsessing about the past was destructive for me, for everyone. [Panting] It's time for me to look to the future, I think. I feel like... I'm Finally on my way there.
