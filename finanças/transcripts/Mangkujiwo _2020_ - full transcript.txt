Presented by Raam Punjabi. An Azhar Kinoi Lubis film. Kanti. What I have done to deserve this... ...having the likes of you living in my village? Calm down. I wasn't the one... ...who held you captive in this filthy place. Now, eat. Eat, so that your body is stronger. Ask mercy to God, child. You... ...are like a dog on a leash, being controlled by Tjokro! Calm down! I'm not crazy! You're the one who's crazy! I'm more than well! Tjokro is the one who's sick! Let me go! Take this off! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! Thank you, Mr. Broto, for coming to this village. We've been waiting for your arrival. The doctor told me that you have a little problem. That's right, My Lord. Where is she? Over there. Please. The elders are worried, and children are scared to go out. Ludro, the wild boar, which was considered a bad omen... ...appeared once again at the outskirts of the village. The air became hard to breathe... ...and reeks the stench of corpses. Kanti is the source of all calamities and disasters. Mr. Tjokro was right. And he canceled all his funding for this village, because of her. This way please. Tjokro did all of this to you? I know you're not crazy. I know. Do you want to recover? Do you want to take revenge? People say we shouldn't delay for hell to come. When we seek revenge, we are already in hell. They say that because they never suffered of being abused. I know your suffering. I know. I know your suffering. I am very grateful to you, Mr. Broto. You have liberated this village from this burden. I liberated her from all of you. I'm doing this because I feel... ...this human being still deserves another chance. Only you are capable of... -I will take my leave, Chief. -Alright. May God help this child. Amen, My Lord. You wretched witch! I have one wish My lover Always be together Wherever During days and nights Never be parted Even for a single hair You are far away But near by heart And we stare at each other When we are near I sincerely say it Like the legend of Mimi and Mituno Come, My Lover We face our call Go and bring her some food. This is the best way, Kanti. Believe me. Believe... ...me. I told you... ...you don't need to purify the relics here. Yes, My Lord. But you're still doing that. You used to do it at the refinery. It's been 19 years, My Lord, since we purified the Pengilon Kembar. Cleansing this mirror from all kinds of evil. Well, you've already brought it here. I hope your heart is now content. It's not a matter of whether my heart is content. But this mirror is acting strange. As if the mirror is giving us a sign, My Lord. Nonsense! Don't make matters worse! This sign is out of the ordinary. Perhaps you still have unfinished business. My Lord, initially there are two Pengilon Kembar. Perhaps if we unite them,... ...everything will be where it should be. Where is the other one? One is in your possession. And the other one, in Lord Broto's possession. You both were once in charged of the relic refinery. Enough! That's enough, Nyai! Let's go. Believe me. Calm down. Eat it! I'm not crazy! I am sane. This is all Tjokro's doing. No, please! Let me go! Happy birthday, Uma! Oh, my God! Happy birthday, Honey. May you live long and happy forever. Why don't you look for a boyfriend? That way, you'll get to go out on Saturday nights. Maybe watch a movie or something. Not working like this. Stop it. Don't tell me what to do. Your boyfriend, Hendro, is already waiting for you, isn't he? Happy birthday, Uma. May you live long and be healthy. -Where is my present? -First, let's have a party. -Where are we going? -To work. Come on, Uma. Why are you working on a Saturday night? Hey, what if we all drink at your work place? Do we get any discount? Your handsome face doesn't represent your wallet. That's a good one, Uma. Mr. Raymond. I don't believe that all these relics will merely become... ...an art collection at a gallery in your country. And what's that supposed to mean, Karmila? Currently, we are giving you the standard price... ...as if it were considered as an art collection. That's right and it's already a suitable price. But you lied to us, Mr. Raymond. What do you mean? I have information... ...that you are selling these relics as research items. And of course in that case, the value becomes much higher... ...than merely just art collection, Mr. Raymond. Now this discussion has interfered with my personal matters. You already know... ...that in this rich country of yours... ...these kind of items are being neglected. And may even be considered as cursed items. I'm not saying that's wrong. But aren't you supposed to be grateful to people like myself... ...who can give more value... ...to these items? And I am willing to pay a more profitable price... ...for you and your colleagues. More profitable you say? Mr. Raymond. You know... ...what happens here in this room is very risky for us. And I'm sure you know... ...with a bigger risk, it's only proper that we get a higher price. Mr. Raymond, you need to know... ...that we are not just dealing with a couple of archaeologist... ...and other envious collectors. You will not be able to intimidate a foreigner such as myself. Especially, in a condition like this. I am capable of doing a lot more than just intimidate, Mr. Raymond. Herman. Herman! You fool, Herman! Hi, Beautiful. Do you want to make matters worse? Karmila, we already have a big issue in our hands today. Just deal with Herman. Let me take care of that girl. I said enough, Karmila! Make sure she's silenced. Fool. You are too beautiful... ...to be murdered. I didn't mean that. I didn't intend to do that. Please forgive me. God damn you. Did Tjokro touch your thigh like this? And then he said... ..."You have flawless thighs like marbles." And then he said... ..."I will give you a child... ...that will elevate your status and dignity." But he deceived you. The way he caress you... ...and also said... ..."Your hair is very long and wavy." "Just like Dewi Gagarmayang, who made Arjuna head over heels for her." "Will you be my queen?" And then, he groped you. I am so sorry for the death of your son, Pulung Kusumo. Mr. Tjokro. I have asked my comrades at the police station... ...to prioritize this case. You people are more concerned about your business. My guess is, this has something to do with that. Please give us any clue. Perhaps it's one of your competitors. I don't have any competitor. Tjokro Kusumo doesn't have a competitor. Let me remind you people. Our affairs are far more greater than your business. Excuse me, Sir. I'm sure you know who might be a suspect. And this is important to us. We have one name that came up, based on our ongoing investigation,... ...Kanjeng Raden Brotoseno. Do you know him? Yes. We worked together once handling the relic refinery. That's a strong motive, Sir. I think that there are certain parties... ...who intends to steal your relic refinery. This relic matter has cost my son. I've warned you before, My Lord. But you didn't believe me. You were right. Other relics... ...are tools to banish our enemies. But this Pengilon Kembar gives us signs that will happen in the future. Giving us time. That's the power of Pengilon Kembar, My Lord. Pengilon Kembar weren't created by men. They were given directly from the nether realm of Sendang Kidul. The other relics are tools of war. But these relics are in the form of mirrors. Why is that, Nyai? According to my father, tools of war end lives. While science perpetuate it. Pengilon Kembar is science,... ...which is beyond magic, My Lord. Forgive me, My Lord. I've been wanting to speak to you about this for years. But I was afraid. Because my father, Ki Suro... Yes, I know your father. He once told me to obey every word you say. Whether it's something you wanted to discuss or didn't want to. -When he left... -Brotoseno? Move that mirror into my house. But, My Lord... -This Pengilon Kembar... -What now? What else are you hiding from me? Nothing, My Lord. Hendro has an aunt who has a house near a lake. It's beautiful. -You can stay there, if you like... -No, thank you. I know you are concerned. But I think the best choice is to go back home to my own house. Uma, if you need anything, just call me, okay? Here comes the guest Go roll the carpet But the carpet is torn Fix it with sticky rice But the sticky rice is spoiled Give it to the dogs And dogs will die I've been waiting for you to come home. Don't worry. Every threat that comes... ...won't be able to touch you. Here comes the guest Give it to the dogs Father, please forgive me. I haven't come home since last year. When I left, I was leaving so much trouble. And now, I came home bringing even more troubles. I think this is my way... ...to heal Kanti. Even though... ...you think that I am torturing myself. I am Herman. Colonel Herman. I'm looking for Hanuma. Is she here? Why are you looking for her? Mr. Broto. I'm concerned that the police might want to question her. May I come in? Are you the police? I'm with the army. And you know that I could reach even higher places. Especially, if it involves murder. My daughter is not a murderer. That's right. She was the last person with Pulung before he was murdered. The victim is Pulung, Mr. Broto. Tjokro Kusumo's son. So, Tjokro sent you here? Careful, Mr. Broto. It seems you have a motive which connects Hanuma to this murder. Considering that she is your daughter, right? My daughter is incapable of murdering anybody. So, you want her to have that capability? How dare you, Colonel. Let's just end this conversation. Fine. Oh, yeah. Next time I'll come here and ask about your daughter's perfume. Good afternoon, Mr. Broto. Now you know, Father. I'm just a trouble maker. There's no trouble. Do you still want the other Pengilon Kembar? I was just thinking, My Lord. It's better if we unite these two mirrors as it refers to their names. Maybe you should... Are you asking me to make peace with Brotoseno? Brotoseno is a two-faced man. He pretends to be a loyalist... ...to the king. He undermined the kingdom of Keraton and gave it to foreign schools... ...who thought they were educated! And they... ...pretentiously tried to make a new order. That's why. You hear? As long as Brotoseno and I are still alive... ...these Pengilon Kembar... ...will never be united. Never! Yes, My Lord. Sadi. Your master never intended... ...to cure me. Do you think... ...that he's going to treat my current condition? You are just like him. I am just a livestock of what he is actually breeding. When the time comes, he will harvest what's inside me. You know exactly what he's trying to do, Sadi. Look at that mirror! Look! Those demons are molesting me every night. I am just Brotoseno's creation, Sadi. To make me become one of them. Do you think Brotoneso will listen to you? It's better... ...if you just let me go, Sadi. Or... ...you should just kill me, Sadi. While your master is not here. Help me, Sadi! Let me go! Sadi! You were born right here, Uma. Why are you now allowing me to come here? I've always wanted to know more, but we rarely had the chance to talk. I've always wanted to leave this house. Because in here... ...I always feel lonely. Please forgive me, Uma. But it's a good thing for you to come here... ...at your birthday. I will always be with you. I will never let you go. But you are full of secrets. I always feel isolated. Here. Thank you, Father. Do you think I still keep that mirror, Nyai? My father... -...Ki Suro... -Surodigdo? He once said that when you were in charge of the relic refinery... ...the Pengilon Kembar were still together. I am no longer keeping those items, Nyai. You know that I am now a Batik salesmen. My Lord. Perhaps everyone believes, the patterns on those Batik... ...aren't just an ordinary painting. But there is a story painted on it. And only a few people knows the meaning of these stories. But it can be anybody. As long as they try very hard to find it out. Isn't that right, My Lord? It seems that batik artisan is the youngest among the others. And she looks different from the others. Is she your daughter? I never knew you were married. I am just imagining... ...if those relics are being preserved by you, My Lord. How dare you? How dare you speak like that to the lord? Yes, My Lord. So, you want to stab your own master in the back in front of me? How dare you? No, My Lord. As a Caretaker, Nyai. Do you understand? You must know that your Lord Tjokro... ...will never be annihilated, unless... Unless, in the hands of his own heredity. You already know too much, Nyai. If this makes you trust me, I will tell you. Lord Tjokro forbid me to come here. And he has no idea of this visit. I will take my leave, My Lord. Father. Who was that woman? She's just a regular customer. Mr. Tjokro, even your own son died very unnaturally. And his death is related to our business. And his death has threatened our business. Could it be that there is a connection with Brotoseno's daughter? Brotoseno never had a child. But he told Herman that her daughter is called Uma. He doesn't even have a wife. Brotoseno's daughter is not registered at the civil registration, Sir. This young lady is dangerous. Because she caught us red handed when Raymond was killed at the hotel. Your affairs are now covered in blood. I also don't want this matter to drag on for too long. But if it's true... If this child is really Brotoseno's daughter,... ...you have to get rid of her immediately. -Unless... -Unless what? Unless you want the relic refinery to fall once again in the hands of Brotoseno. Hi, Hanuma. -What do you want? -What would you like? I should've killed you last time. I was sent here by Mr. Tjokro Kusumo. I didn't kill anybody! I don't know who's Tjokro Kusumo. This is not about business. The thing is you know our little secret. Sadi? Sadi! Sadi. I don't care if you think that I purposely... ...lured that colonel to be killed by my daughter. I don't care! Do you think I pit them like some roosters? Do you know that Tjokro and his goons... ...are going to steal all of the Keraton relics? That's why, he deserved this. Now, why did you come back after 19 years since you failed? You were careless. Sadi. My leg hurts, Sadi. It really hurts. Please, take it off. I am not going anywhere. I am too weak, Sadi. Please, it hurts. You fool! Did you plan all of this? Sadi! What's wrong, Sadi? Kill you? And relieve you of your burden upon failing to serve... ...in the name of honor? That's too easy for you, Sadi. Just leave. Go on. Go and live with your disgrace. The walls of a noblemen's house are very thin, Mrs. Karmila. Our ears may hear a lot of things. But our mouths are forever in silence. I sent someone to take care of Uma, not to avenge Tjokro's grudge. But I'm sure... ...Tjokro Kusumo is hiding something about Brotoseno and his daughter. Brotoseno never had a daughter. Mrs. Karmila. More or less, I am familiar about your business with Lord Tjokro... ...which made our relics collection vanished one by one. I don't know what you're talking about and I don't want to get involved. I just want my business to go smoothly. But isn't your business with Lord Tjokro depends so much on the relic refinery? Do you understand now? Sometimes these relics demand sacrifice. You are already too deeply involved, Mrs. Karmila. There's something threatening Tjokro Kusumo. And there's a chance it's Brotoseno's doing. So, exactly who do you want out of the two of them to be eliminated? A disaster will fall upon one of these lords. And we will be dragged into them. You must prepare yourself to choose a side. It all happened simultaneously, Father. Death follows wherever I go. First, the guy at that hotel and now this man. What's wrong with me, Father? I could hear that song even louder. And it made me unaware of what I was doing. What song? I don't even know it, Father. But I could hear that song getting even louder in this house. Tjokro Kusumo slandered me. In front of the king he said... ...that I leaked the whereabouts of the paramilitary troops... ...because I was close with the Dutch officials. I was accused... ...of leaking the whereabouts of the paramilitary troops. These troops were over here, and the other troops were over there. I was accused of leaking everything. He is so cruel, Father. What's even worse he tried to destroy every single thing in my life. Tjokro urge the king to get rid of me... ...by giving me long assignments outside the island. At that time your mother, Kanti, was expecting a baby. Tjokro went to your mother... ...and told her because of my activities, I was arrested by the Dutch army. Tjokro Kusumo summoned every demon through animals and dark magic... ...to misguide your mother's mind until she became mad. And by the time I got home, your mother has hung herself. I was forced to bring you into this world by cutting through your mother's corpse. And then I found out... ...that it was really Tjokro Kusumo who killed your mother. But he did it by hanging her. So, it would look like your mother commit suicide. Are we going to be even closer... ...Father? Uma... Hanuma Kinanti. You are my most valuable treasure. Wear this, your mother's hair pin. You will look more beautiful, just like your mother. I'll bet on that red color! The red one again! Chief, bring her to me. -What are you doing? -Let go of me! I was here first! I was dancing with her! -Do you want to fight? -That's enough. Don't do this in front of Lord Tjokro. Just go back to your seat. Don't cause any trouble. Lord Tjokro asked for your company. You know what to do, right? I've brought back Uma to you here with my own hands. You still don't trust me? You want us to work together, Nyai? Tjokro Kusumo was so scared and escaped to Sendang Kidul before Uma showed up. But, My Lord,... ...he will come back to his house. Now it's time for us to talk even further. My Lord, I never imagined... ...that finally these Pengilon Kembar will be reunited. -Did you torture her? -I was training her. You are infusing Kanti with vengeance. You were exploiting this mirror... ...through Kanti. This Pengilon Kembar... ...will grant our wishes. That's where the power lies. What? Damn it! You wanted her baby. That baby... ...is your harvest. Here comes the guest Go roll the carpet But the carpet is torn Fix it with sticky rice But the sticky rice is spoiled Give it to the dogs And dogs will die And throw them to the river I disagree. I'm not fond of any kind of vengeance. Why do you need to tell Uma that Tjokro is back in his house? Father. I forced her to tell me. Aren't we getting even closer now, Uma? Isn't that enough? Uma. This is what I'm afraid of. When I've revealed all my secrets to you,... ...you are burdening your life by taking revenge, Uma. I must take revenge. I have the right to my own fate! You really know how to use her stubbornness to your advantage. We hear a piercing and violent cry The strongest demon... ...dwells in the most glorious temple inside a human being, My Lord. In a broken heart When we know that... ...we just need to summon it. With a deep feeling of loneliness All the way The Kingdom of Keraton may fall. A faint and... But everything will be in your hands, My Lord. A miserable regret Don't be so modest, Nyai. "It's late at night." "You are going to disappear." Don't wake up from your bed Watch out, don't show yourself I am in a furious outrage Who are you? Are you Tjokro Kusuma's minion? What do you mean? Don't interfere with my affairs! I don't even know who you are! I don't care about your advise! You're just getting in my way! Tjokro! Are you going to kill me, Child? You also killed my son, didn't you? Mother... You little brat! We did it. I did it, Nyai! I did it! It turns out that Uma and Kanti are still belong to me. Let me take care of her, Nyai. Now you've become a princess. My Lord. Kanti is locked away in her cage. Isn't that enough, Nyai? As long as Uma is certain that we are at her side,... ...Kanti will not attack us. And this lock peg... ...will give us time... ...to control Uma completely. My Lord. We have reached Mangkujiwo. Mangkujiwo? To take and control a soul.
