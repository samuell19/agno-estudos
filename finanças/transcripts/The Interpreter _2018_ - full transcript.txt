THE INTERPRETER Good afternoon. I'm Ali Ungár. I'm looking for SS-Sturmbannführer Dr. Kurt Graubner. I called him several times, wrote, but he never answered. He died. Oh... I'm sorry. I would've needed to talk to him. Dr. Graubner shot my parents. My father shot hundreds of people. Sure... Well, thank you. Can I use your toilet? Please. Thank you. You didn't say anyone was coming. He'll be out right away. But I can't sit here until evening. Stop it! Don't be silly! You're two weeks overdue with my money. Where is the money? Here! Thank you! Thank you. Give it to me! Don't be silly. Stop it! Done? Can I have a glass of water? Jola, bring a glass of water. I'm a translator. I got your father's book. He also writes there about his work in Slovakia. Did you read it? Here you go. Are you a Jew? -Is it important? -Do you want money? I don't have any. I haven't seen my father in forty years. It was after his stroke when I moved here. He couldn't talk, he was just blabbering. Finito. You should go now. Are you throwing me out? As you can see, I am busy with something else. You are simply an anti-Semitic pig! And you are a Zionist superhuman! Hello! Mr. Ungár! Clear the cellar. Gasmen can't get to the clock. You hear me? Ali, call me when you get home. I need to know when you will return the 50 euro you owe me. Answer it! Daddy! You're worse than a little kid. I can't come on Saturday, I'm going to camp. They sent us children from Ukraine, from that war zone. Call me. I'll pay you for the phone. Daddy! This is Procházková from the publishing house. An Austrian wants to meet you. What should I say to him? Hi! Did you come to apologize? You scratched my mailbox. I only expressed my opinion. Won't you sit down? Why did you read it? It has no literary or historical value. I'm trying to find out where my parents are buried. Could you spare me a few days? I would like to see all the places where my father was during the war. I no longer work as an interpreter. These are letters that my father wrote to me from Slovakia. You might be interested. My father was intolerant. He studied law in Graz and at the age of twenty he was already a member of the SS. He only got the job he really enjoyed after the Anschluss. And it was? Deputy Gestapo Commander. The mother spoke of that time as the best years of their lives. She said: Your father was not a fascist. He was an honest man. He did nothing to be ashamed of. He just chased thieves, murderers and Jews. Why did you choose me? Because of objectivity. And to make it clear that I'm not an anti-Semitic pig. I'm charging a hundred euro a day. Fine. But we have to agree on rules. I will only be available to you ten hours a day. I will always have my own room on the road. I'm an interpreter, no entertainer. -You're late. -Good morning! Give me the suitcase. And the coat. -I'm Georg. -Nice to meet you. This allows you to move the seat back. -Leave it alone! -This is how you adjust your position. You don't sleep with your wife anymore, do you? What do you care? Your hair grows and you are irritable. My wife has been dead for ten years. So where do we start? In Banská Bystrica, in the archive. Do you have a driver's license with you? I do not have a car. On principle. If you're not driving, you have to entertain me. What diseases do you have? All. A stomach ulcer broke out a year ago. But it was good for something. When one becomes ill, he realises he only has one life. Did you drink? Oh yeah. I was at an alcohol clinic. Along with burnt-out teachers. There was a guy from Linz who was still carrying a first aid kit. With a red cross on the lid. -Do you know what he had in it? -Booze? Suicide pills. I had to get out of there. Otherwise I would've gone crazy. Table tennis all day. In the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening. And I had to write a diary. Normally I was forced to write about my family. About my mother, about my father... What I did well, what I didn't... Just... bullying. But... Suddenly I couldn't run away from myself. -Are you a teacher? -Well, I taught languages. English and French. And you? Where did you learn German? You have a funny accent. In the monastery. I was there at the orphanage. My mom wanted to save us, me and my sister, so she had us baptised. I see. Haven't seen my parents ever since. They were hiding in northern Slovakia, until they met your father. Please. -No thanks. -Have a sip? -No. -Do you drink? -It's just liqueur. You'll be driving. Do you want to kill us? Another liqueur for a friend. I'll wait for you outside. Mr. Ungár! Pull it up! Trousers. In the vicinity of Ružomberok the German names of the villages have been preserved. I'd like to go through this with you and the little one. Without a uniform, like normal people. Karl and Hans and I went to Mount Sidorovo. A storm caught us. We were completely soaked, but we wanted to reach the top. It was weird. As if the effort only strengthened our need to be better. There was nothing to see from the land- scape, but I wanted to stay up at all costs Stay in silence on top and be yourself for a while. This is my grandfather Ali. He is in perfect shape. She's waiting for pretty girls. Mr. Ungár, I found us a driver! It's Truda. Behind the wheel... -And this is Berta. -Good afternoon. We will take them to Teplice. It's by our route. They didn't drink anything. The girls are masseuses at the spa. Let's get going! Back! To Berta! Chop chop! I'm Berta. Are you brothers? Twins. -You don't look alike. -We're not from the same mother. Don't fool around! What did he say? -He asked if you were single. -Really? -How old do you think they are? -Hundred. -102 with shoes. -We can't start with those. -They could die in bed. -Girls, I'm ready. Don't be disgusting. -How do you speak Slovak? -I'm an interpreter. -And you are what? -I do not understand. Tell him if he's looking for a wife, I don't have anyone now. He says if you're looking for a wife, she's available. If she means it, I have a nice three-room apartment in Vienna. What did he say? He offered you a three-room apartment in Vienna. Poor thing, his pension wouldn't be enough for what I eat in a day. I worked there as a caregiver. But I couldn't recover from it all year. What happened? I took care of an old lady. She lived with her husband in a family house near Neusiedl. Eva and Willy. I wanted to go wake them on Sunday morning, but through the door I heard them talking. It was so nice. Willy said something, Eva laughed softly and said: I want to lie there. I turned on the coffee maker and then the sound came. My father was a hunter, so I recognised it. Shot from a pistol. And then another. I opened the door... and they were both dead. Why did they do it? I don't know. That's how I want to die, too. It is love. Don't talk nonsense! I cannot agree with such empty gestures. My whole family wanted to survive, but they didn't get a chance. One should have a choice. What should he do when he no longer has the strength to live? Put this on! -Who is this? -Our band! Who the hell sings? I do. Thank you, handsome. Thanks. Thank you for driving. Too bad you're so shy. Women must have loved you. Stop! Stop! Stop! -What is? -Don't you want to take a bath? I bought these for us. One pair for you. I'm not going there. Just change. You may need to translate something. Great! Come in! I cannot swim. -Have you never been to the sea? -I have. My wife and I were in Bulgaria once. Since she died, I'm not going anywhere. -Don't you have a girlfriend? -I'm eighty. That is not an argument. There are drugs for that. Do you remember Jola? She comes once, twice a week, and then we get crazy. It's not about gymnastics. It's just fun. Don't you feel embarrassed? You just can't behave all the time. All my marriages failed. And how many were there? Three. I lived with my wife for fifty-two years. -Didn't you get bored? -No. We were always arguing. Have you never had a mistress? Just one. And it didn't take long. I had a bad conscience. We hid in rented apartments, went on business trips together, but when I experienced something nice, I was sorry my wife wasn't there. That's bad, dear friend. One must cheat with pleasure. That little masseuse is waiting for you. She said she liked you. You remind her of the "Lord of the Rings" elf. -Elf? -In a cute way. You have a chance with her. I don't like it when someone else touches me. Only my wife massaged me. Up here... This is a gift from the girls! And this is for you. Try it on. I thought this was a business trip, but you're making it a vacation. Listen, Ungár, have you ever enjoyed anything? As far as we know, you never laughed. Were you happy at least when your children were born? I only have one daughter. She was born prematurely, completely tiny. She would've fit in your palm. You must have been happy about something. Of course. A friend once brought me a record from England. Signed by Bob Dylan. It stood there: To Ali with love, Bob. Well, you see, you have a good friend. The best. We worked together in the newspaper. In 1968, when the Russians came here, we drafted petitions together, put up posters, mocked Russian soldiers. And then, when it was clear that we would not get rid of the Russians, he came to me and said: Look, Ali, your parents were killed you during the war, you are an orphan, you were in the party... Take everything on yourself. And what did you do? I took it all on me. That brought the state security agents on me for years. Follow me. Here's everything you wanted. Documents on the operation of special sections, photographs and testimonies of witnesses. There are also mentions of your father. You can keep those copies. Thank you. If you need anything, I'm in the office. In the morning, on my way to work, I went unnoticed behind a barracks, from where I watched it all behind a stack of straw. They started digging a pit there and when it was dug up, they put the people in front of it. He shot one by one and the others had to store them there. Then they brought another to the pit and he shot him again. When they were done, they buried them, ran over them by bus, and left. As an eyewitness, I was summoned to the exhumation. There we saw that they did not use any firearms on the children. I saw with my own eyes the children being thrown into the pit, covered with ground and buried alive... Hold it! They stole my jacket. Everything is gone. Money, documents, I had everything there. I told you not to leave it there. Don't fuck with me! What are you doing there? Those people care about your money, not your documents - who you are. They throw those the trash. Do not worry. I have some money. Thank you. How much would two single rooms cost? 110 euro. And one double? 70. I'll take the double. Double bed. You can't be serious! The situation in eastern Ukraine is still tense. The inhabitants of the Luhansk region have not yet been able to repair the damage, caused during the fighting between the Ukrainian army and the separatists. People are still without food, drinking water and electricity. Children can't go to school... Will it take a long time? Sorry, I always shave in the evening. What do you need this for? Do you even have a license for it? -Give that back, please. -No! I won't be at peace with someone with a gun. When I went to see your father, I wanted to hurt him. I was standing in front of your apartment and I was thinking, that your father will open, and how he says something arrogant, I'll shoot. But then you were standing there... You are a psychopath! When communism ended here and this beautiful democracy began, my wife and I went down the street. And suddenly a guy jumped up to me and he began cursing at me, communists and Jews. And he started beating me. The cops didn't care. They ignored my announcement. That's when I thought, that I will never be beaten again, and I got this gun. I shouldn't have come here. Hello. What can I offer you? -This is you, aren't you? -Yes. -What did you win there? -Bartending competition in Cape Town. Congratulations. Thank you. Should I mix you something? Try it. We'll see if I survive. Try it. You are too good for this place. Charge it on room 409. I've been here two months, but I don't know when it will end. If you can, send me a picture of the little one, so that I can see how much he's grown. I had a day off yesterday. I went to see the city. The houses are dilapidated, but the church was full. A seventeen-year-old girl was sitting behind the organ. She barely reached the pedals, but played very nicely. I discovered a butcher shop in an alley. There were beautiful oriental tiles on the walls and floor. When I asked where they got them from, the butcher smiled at me and said: From a synagogue. I'm 32 years old and every guy I've dated left me. I do not believe that. And look at my mother! This is her third wedding. There's always someone she just has to help. She met this one at a PC course. She started tutoring him in Excel spreadsheets. I suppose you're computer literate? Do you want to tutor me? Why not? -I'll charge it to your room as well? -Thank you. Excuse me... stupid joke. Room 409. What are you actually doing here? I'm trying to find out what my father did here during the war. And what have you found out? He murdered people. No one has ever tried to hit on me like that. Are you kidding? Do you want to dance? No. Thank you. My first wife liked to dance. We went to dancing bars but it was a long time ago. How long ago? Very long ago. You're a really pretty girl. -Come on! -Yes, you are. -Come on! -What? That? No! Don't be silly! And now... What? Now... Nothing. Mr. Ungár! It's me! Mr. Ungár! Mr. Ungár, will you pay in cash or by card? But I paid for everything yesterday. Restaurant bill written in the room. And this is from the minibar. -It must be a mistake. -You signed it here. You locked me out. You should have taken the card. I overdid it a bit yesterday. There was a wedding here. They invited me. I don't care about your private life, Mr. Graubner. Our agreement is over. I'm leaving. You can not be serious. I was supposed to earn 100 euros a day, and after last night I'm 300 euros in the red. You forged my signature! I am sorry. Of course, I'll pay the debt. This is not about money, but about principle. I paid for everything. -How do you want to get out of here? -We have trains here too. Thank you very much. -Mr. Graubner? -Yes. Sorry, could you come with me? -Mr. Graubner, are these yours? -That's mine, yeah. -Great! -Your documents. We caught him trying to sell them. Look! -What's that? -I don't know. Anything missing? The money is gone. 200 euro. 200 euro are missing. Where did you put them? Don't do a circus here. Don't be mad at him, he's still a child. I'm divorced. -I don't know what to do with him. -Stop it, he still doesn't understand you. Don't ruin his life. I'll give you money. -What does he want from me? -To drop the criminal complaint. Here you are. Let them go. You are making a mistake. I know. Thank you. Go apologise! Go already! Don't you understand? Sorry. That's for yesterday. Do you already have a ticket? The cops caught the thief. If you stay, I will pay you three days in advance. I don't think it makes sense. The cops caught the thief. If you stay, I will pay three days in advance. It does not make sense. What did I do to you? Why are you acting like a victim? I thought we were friends. No, we are not! You think I should repent, don't you? I had a younger sister. She was born after the war. Cute little girl with long braids. She kept laughing. But when my father had to go to jail, she has completely changed. She turned all the disappointment and anger against herself. She stopped eating. Our mother went to see all possible doctors with her, but it didn't help much. Suddenly... Suddenly she didn't want to live anymore. She never had a boyfriend, she kept locking herself up at home. When she was twenty, her kidneys failed, and then it went fast. I'm not like her. I refuse to be blamed for something I didn't do. I don't want you to die. It bothers me that you're acting like a bastard. Then shoot me! I'll go with you if you promise me you won't drink anymore. Bella, shut up! It's me, Mrs. Pečnerová. Where is your husband? At the back. We're having slaughter right now. -I've already told you everything. -But he doesn't know anything about it. During the war, some Jews hid here. They were here for two months. And then someone told on Grandma. Someone from the neighbours. The Germans came here and turned everything upside down. The Jews were hiding in a potato crate. In a pit on the yard. They found them, dragged them to the city and they shot them there. All of them? I don't know. My grandmother for sure. She was left with four children. My family didn't like to talk about it. Among my father's things... I found these photos. On the back it says: Donovaly. Do you know any of those people? Do you know who that is? You sure you don't? Do you want to keep the photos? No thanks. I have mine. Don't you want to buy sheep cheese? Why do you bring people like that here? Because he knows nothing about it. Emil Kysel lives in an old house in Ružomberok. -He had a shop here that time. Do you know him? -No. Talk to him. Maybe he'll remember something. Hey kiddo! Daddy! -Come here! -Jesus! -Hi! -Hi! -Good God! -Why don't you answer my calls? -I forgot my phone at home. Edita, this is Mr. Graubner, a teacher from Vienna. -Welcome. -Good afternoon. You said you wouldn't work anymore. You are ill, do you want to be kick the bucket? -It's not work. -And what is it? Are you taking the money for it? So it is work. Watch out for him. He only translates what he wants. -I noticed that. -His whole life is about doing what he wants. Oxana, you're in charge now! I have children from Ukraine here, so I refresh my Russian. This is "Drunken Izidor." You know it? No. I've never eaten that. -Is there rum in it? -Yes. My German is not very good. I didn't enjoy learning it. The first thing I learned was: I'm stupid. So where are you going? My father was here as a soldier during the war. He wrote a book about it. I came to find out how it really was. Why is this important to you? Your father and I have this thing in common. In a way, we both lost our parents. In a way? Do you really want to compare it? Do you think it's easier to be the killer's son than that of the victim? Half of my family ended up in concentration camps. And those who returned were looked upon by the neighbours as criminals. And the fear that all this may happen again, you have no idea. Do you like it? It's good. My father had me baptised, so that I don't have to worry about my children. How old are they? It turned out differently. I can't have children. You're completely crazy. Since when do you hang out with SS men? He is not an SS man. So who is he? -I don't think he knows either. -Sure! I'll give you some apples. You should move in with us. Something can happen to you in Bratislava, and who will help you there? -And what am I going to do here? -You can go fishing. Editka, who would want to stay with you? You're like a capo in a jail. Don't talk nonsense. Do you know how worried we are about you? Don't worry. I have already sorted this out with Jewish community hospice. I will write my apartment on them, and they will happily look after me. You've been cursing the Jewish community all your life. Never the community. Just the chairman. You have always distanced yourself from Judaism. You've said all your life that you are an atheist, a Marxist and a cosmopolitan. None of those exclude Judaism. There are only five Orthodox Jews in Slovakia. Three rabbis. The rest of us are just free, thinking people. There are only two options. Either you're completely crazy, or you found someone. It's about you stripped me of my legal capacity. Hello! Hello! Where do you come from? Luhansk. And what's your name? Vasja. Would you give me a cigarette? Your father knows you're smoking? I don't have a dad. I have a son... in England. From my third marriage. What does? Anything possible. He is now a gardener. Do you keep in touch? When he was seventeen, he got involved in such a stupid thing... He and his friends robbed an official. My wife blamed me, she said he wanted me to notice him. I couldn't talk to him, but I wanted to help him. I got him lawyers, but he sent me to hell. And when they let him go, he ran away from me. He hung out in Spain, after that Ukraine... He's in Leeds now and we speak often. Good afternoon. We are looking for Emil Kysel. -And who are you? -Childhood friends. Room 311. Is he a Jew too? He is from Austria. Nice... Don't you want to buy it? Lamp. Good afternoon. My name's Ungár. We came to visit your dad. This is my grandfather. Who let you in here? Mr. Graubner is looking for his father's past. He was here as a soldier during the war. What do we have to do with this? Your grandfather met him. Grandpa has Alzheimer's. He won't tell you anything, give him a break. -Maybe he'll remember something. -He doesn't remember shit. He doesn't even know me sometimes. -Did you eat? -Just soup. I brought you schnitzel. Leave us, I have to wash Grandpa. You like it, don't you? Mr. Kysel! Do you have a moment for us? We know your grandfather is an esteemed fella... Leave me alone! Our family had problems after the war. -Grandpa was in jail. -It's not about politics. This is personal. These are letters that Mr. Graubner wrote to his son. And he wants to find out what places his father's been to. All kinds of journalists went to see my grandfather. He told them something, and they twisted it. We are no guardists. My construction company is repairing the synagogue. Won't you come for coffee with us? Maybe you'll tell us something. I do not know anything about that. -Where are you staying? -Nowhere yet. If you want to come hunting, I can arrange for you to shoot a deer. Come on. Thanks. I know everything from my father. When the expulsion of the Jews began, some Teschner came to see my grandfather and asked to take over, to aryanise his shop. He said to him, Mr. Kysel, you are a decent man, I will give it back to you after the war. And stupid grandpa agreed. His grandfather had his Jewish shop aryanised. Teschner even employed him as long as he could, as he didn't know anything about running a business himself. Sugar... Later... I don't know where they keep the sugar bowls. After the war, when the Teschners did not return from the camp, the communists made grandpa a guardist and an aryaniser. In 1948, his business was taken away and he was behind bars during the fifties. But during the war, almost everyone was a guardist. 200 thousand Slovaks. It's been haunting me my whole life. My school applications were turned down saying I was a clerofascist. I already thought it was over, and now you showed up. Didn't your grandfather talk about what happened here during the war? What would happen here? People were being killed. Just leave the keys here in a cup in the morning. And don't go out at night. Gypsies come here to steal, so I let the dogs go. My father wanted to raise me as a man. Once we were chopping wood, he asked me if I trusted him. So put your hand on the log, he said. He spread his ax... and cut off the tip of my fingernail. Then he laughed and said: You can't trust anyone. As a boy, I loved him very much. He came back from the war, so I considered him a hero. Naturally. Then he was unemployed. He couldn't get a job, so we were still together. He had a lot of time for me. We climbed rocks, they went fishing. It was nice. But then when they locked him up, I understood that everything was different. He returned from prison after eight years. The mother invited the whole family to Sunday lunch. My father put on a suit. And then they pulled old photos out of the closet and porcelain plates, which they hid after the war. Mother poured cream soup into them, my father wished everyone bon appétit and we started eating. No words. And when I finished the soup, there was a swastika at the bottom of the plate. My father hasn't changed at all. I'm sorry, I have to pee. Do you know him? I remember... They were staying in the school. And they came my shop. They paid once a week, but they owed nothing. And do you remember the Pečner family? There were a lot of Jews back then. And the Pečners traded with them. Someone told on them but the Germans did not want to get their hands dirty, so they tied them up, threw them on the car and sent them to the city. Our people took care of them there. -Ours? -Guardists. Behúň, Mikšík, Krkoška... They slowly stripped Jews of their belongings. They got those great leather shoes, I envied them so much. Warm. Padded. But they got shot anyway. You know where the calvary hill is? There is sort of a pit there. Something like a ditch. They had to kneel one by one and Mikšík shot them in the head. I felt sorry for them. Poor things... But what can we do? If they came back, they would've taken my business. And what happened to Mikšík? He died. They're all dead. I don't have any friends anymore. In May 1945 a mass grave was unveiled in the courtyard of the chateau. The bodies were placed in two layers on top of each other. The heads of the first bodies lay at the feet of the second, to save space. In SS jargon, this was called the sardine method. The body of Mária Kollárová was found in the grave. It was approximately 145 to 150 centimeters high. She didn't have any IDs with her. Her identity was determined only with a certain probability, because the body was charred. Jew Júlia Sajlingerová from Ružomberok she was wearing a coffee brown dress during the execution and green stockings. All bodies lay face down. A total of 22 dead, of which 14 women and 8 men. The doctor stated that they had been killed by a bullet in the back of the head. None of the victims found were identified, leading to the conclusion that their relatives and friends were also murdered. Mr. Ungár? Mr. Ungár? Mr. Ungár. Mr. Ungár! Mr. Ungár, don't worry, I'll come with you. -You can't help us here. -But I can sit here and wait. You won't help us here. Everything is alright. Wait outside. I will wait here. For my friend. -Edita! -Good afternoon. -What happened? -Do not worry. It is stabilized. Where is he? Hello. Thank you for helping him. Hi Dad. It's alright. Thank you. Hello. I'm glad you're finally home. Hello. Hi, Father. We didn't know what would happen to us next. They drove us out of the way, drove us uphill and when we came to the house of Izidor Debnár, there were already more people and we had to stay standing. There were guards all around, and we couldn't even move. And our mother said to us, Come hither, my children; if they are to kill us, let us die at once and together. We saw that there were a lot of people all around us. And when I looked around later, those people were gone. They shot them all. The room and kitchen were already full... I don't know how we fell. I know my mom was moving a little, but then I lost consciousness. I fainted. When I woke up, I felt a burning pain in my leg. And blood was still pouring from my sister's mouth. She held me around my neck and grunted as the blood bubbled and flowed. I told her: Quiet, Helenka, or they will hear us. But she didn't answer me anymore. And when I got to my feet, I saw all my dearest, parents, siblings... But no one showed signs of life, no one even moved... God, it was such a terrible feeling. I said to myself: God, where should I go, who should I go to now? What will happen to me? I don't have anyone anymore. English subtitles by sakaali | 2020
