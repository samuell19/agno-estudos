Presents A film by The angels, by the sound of his voice, know the love of a man; by the articulation of the sound, his wisdom; and by the sense of his words, his learning. Let the train pass … The mic is... in. – Sound! – It’s rolling. CORRESPONDENCES Before the sea, the earth and the sky that covers all, nature had a single face all over the world and they called it Chaos, a crude and shapeless mass. There was nothing except inert weight and scattered seeds of unconnected things. Battles, crimes, children, poets, bullets, errors. One day we’ll see the world lived no drama. A dancer was I But I never danced... No, I stayed safe inside The king’s prison Where is the open sea And washed-away time? So very close To the longed-for garden A ballerina was I... Spent my whole life Wandering as though blind My life bound by knots I never untied Out of delicacy I have wasted my life... All right. Look at the poets. One day we shall see that the world lived no drama. All of these battles, all of these crimes, all of these children who didn’t unfold into living flesh and from whom, nevertheless, living flesh was made to be killed, all these poets riddled with bullets and all of the other poets abandoned by those who didn’t have the courage to kill a man, all this deceived and robbed youth and those who died knowing they were being robbed, all of this blood expressly curdled over the entire face of the earth, all of this is the glorious reverse of the ending of errors. One day we'll be free from death while not ceasing to die You're not a navigator but an emigrant Legitimate Portuguese of this century You took along your family You took dreams furies labours and nostalgia; Day by day we lived your absence In the innermost depth of the deep High caves where presence dwells And now the news that you have died And something in our life dislocates You had been away for a long time But letters poems and news would arrive And we thought you would always return As long as friends here waited for you And you sometimes came from the foreign land Not as prodigal son but as a wise brother And we laughed and talked around the table Glasses, forks and china clinked As if rejoicing in your arrival You brought a certain air as of a captain of storms – Grandiose victor and a very bitter loser – And there was eagerness haste and hurry In our desire to stifle years of distance in hours of talk And around the table we celebrated the feast Of the moment that shone amid fruits and faces And now the news that you have died Death arrives like no letter You can rob me of everything: of my ideas, words, images, of my metaphors, themes, motifs, of my symbols and precedence in suffering the pains of a new language, in understanding others, in daring to fight, to judge, to penetrate recesses of love impervious to your impotence. And then you can refuse to quote me, you can suppress me, ignore me, and even acclaim other, more fortunate thieves. It matters not: your punishment shall be terrible. For when your grandchildren no longer know who you are, they'll have to know me far better than you pretend not to as all that you have painstakingly pillaged will revert to my name. And it will be mine counted as mine, credited to me, even what little you did not steal but achieved on your own. You'll have nothing at all, not even your bones, for they'll dig up one of your skeletons and say it's mine. So that other thieves, just like you, can kneel and place flowers on the tomb. Jorge de Sena said to understand him you needed the joy of a bird at the crumbs of life; and the pain of not being a bird to make do with them Good. Assis, 30 October 1959 My dearest Sophia and Francisco, This letter isn’t yetnews from Brazil, whose freedom is hard to get used to, so paralysed we are when we get here. It’s a fond recollection, on the eve of our birthdays, Sophia’s and mine … with every hope that soon we can breathe a different air together. I want you to know that with this leap I made, I abandoned nothing or nobody, quite the contrary. Forgive my silences, and never stop sending me your news which is precious to me. With a big hug, missing you, ever yours, Jorge Dear Jorge, From the bottom of our hearts Francisco and I wish you and Mécia and the little ones every happiness in this new year in a new land. Forgive the long silence, you know I have a gift for phone calls and none for writing letters. With airmail letters it’s even worse: once they’re written they’re left in a drawer until I go downtown. We are good and well. The worst thing is the struggle against the atmosphere outside, a struggle that uses up strength and time. We miss you so much. You were a refuge in a world so terribly different from mine I don't even understand it. I’ve been very unfocused, but sometimes, I don't know how, I write something very constructed although I’d hardly given it thought. In fact I don't write poems like I did before. I write things. We will bloom again in the brightness of the morning And our souls... will acquire a splendour forfeited in shapes... That's wrong! We will bloom again in the brightness of the morning And our souls will acquire the splendour Foretold in the shapes we forfeited Me? – May I? – Yes And before you begin, can you announce it? Yes. Poem by Sophia From the letters And we laughed and talked around the table Glasses, forks and china clinked As if rejoicing in your arrival You brought a certain air as of a captain of storms Grandiose victor and a very bitter loser And there was eagerness haste and hurry In our desire to stifle years of distance in hours of talk And there was vehement emotion in your solemn friendship And around the table we celebrated the feast Of the moment that shone amid fruits and faces May I? It’s recording! One must leave on earth the weeds and sorrow, and on the water’s surface leave the gall of life. When dead we should take with us the desire and sense of our existence that while reaching out beyond the mire below the deepest waters shall be as green as age-old hope eternal upon the bitter meadows now in bloom. Simonetta Vespucci's Murder Men In the sharp outlines of rooms In the mortal angles of shadow and light. See how the swords flash – suddenly – Without anyone having drawn them. See how the gestures are cast In the precise geometries of fate. See how the men become animals And how the animals become angels And only one bursts and makes himself into a lily. See the endlessly blank stare Of the watery eyes filled with grief Of a woman strangled in her own hair. And the entire room lies abandoned, Full of horror and full of disorder With the doors left open, Open to the roads By which the men are taking flight In the sharp silence of vast expanses, In the mortal angles of shadow and light. And to the North and the South And to the East and the West The four horses of the winds Are tossing their manes And the spirit of the sea asks: "What has become of him for whom I saved a realm of purity, of vast space and of emptiness. Of waves deep and white And icy green?" He will not sleep on smooth sands Among jelly fish, shells and corals He will sleep in decay And to the North and the South To the East and the West The four horses of the wind transparent and exact will forget him For he has strayed from the eternal Removed himself from the whole And given himself to the broken time Of pitiless streets. 24 December 1960 Dear Sophia, It’s Christmas Eve, a Christmas I don’t believe in, but would like to be true on behalf of a humanity I see as incorrigibly evil. More and more I believe nothing remains but the trust that only friendship gives, and a desperate love for humanity that one day death will render useless. In this silence of over a year, where we only heard of each other from second-hand reports, you were always present in my spirit. So what have you been doing, Sophia? What have you published? How has life been treating you? Write and tell. I won't ask about Portugal, for perhaps I know more here than you can know there. So what have you been doing, Sophia? What have you published? How has life been treating you? OK. We can record. How has life been treating you? Write, write and tell. That’s how it's translated in russian... in Jorge de Sena’s poem... Ah, sorry, I mean Pessoa! He says "esta espécie de loucura" which means a kind of madness... You want me to face you, or shall I face the light? Life has always tasted of fate to me. Hence, even now that the salt has dried at the bottom of the ocean and the ocean has become a chamber, even now I'm ignorant of it. I look, astounded, at the wisdom in children's gestures as they begin to feel themselves real. Tenderly, children see themselves light up on both sides, smoothness over. We all saw the sky crumple as it settled on the earth. We come and grow judging idle abandonment to be widespread. And, even in our judging, we seek signs of compromise, slow circular blows in the role of lost... These streets have shortened with time. Is it not with tremendous fear that life revives? Children are born with a courage they lose. Mothers stir in them a courage of the flesh. And men take them along without knowing them. This is in Ponta da Piedade. Look at her! Lisbon, 20 March 1961 Dearest Jorge, Thank you for your Poesia and Andanças do Demónio. Your poetry as a whole has a density without repetition or slackness from the first word to the last. I read your book with a mixture of enthusiasm and deep sadness: enthusiasm because the book is marvellous; sadness because even more it makes me see and think how almost nobody, almost nothing here deserves you. In the Perseguição that you sent me in 1943, two lines of the Andante are underlined: My life always felt like fate to me and Children are born with a courage they lose. This line is at the heart of your poetry. There’s an amazing directness in the book, the testimony of a world where poetry was the only freedom and the poet was called to fulfil his destiny. – Is this Sena? – Yes, that’s Sena. Oh! Translate it for me. The din where I will hear nothing more. The din where I won't move a finger. When did he come back from exile? He left in the late 50s and never returned. He never returned from exile. Where’s Exile? What can I say, Sophia? You saw, with amazing astuteness, two of the lines that sum me up and my vision of life. I don't know, Sophia, over there almost nothing deserves me, but I can assure you they don't deserve us here either. Over here we have the same mindless careerism whose virtue is to be represented in barefaced make-believe. I’ve tendered my resignation from Assis, I got sick of the evasiveness and backstabbing. I’m leaving Theory of Literature, and switching to Portuguese Literature in the university where Sartre was, in Araraquara. You will speak of us as of a dream Golden twilight. Calm phrases. Leasurely gestures. Suave music. Penetrating thought. Subtle smiles. Landscapes gliding on the distance. We were free. We talked, we knew, We loved gently and serenely. An anguish, expunged and mournful: You will dream about this. And the storms, riots, screams, violence, mockery, hate-filled confusion, springtimes dying unnoticed on the nearby hills, prisons, love, the deaths, the tears, the struggles, despair of the life they steal from us – merely a mournful anguish, about which you will dream as a golden age. And secretly, nostalgically, rapturously, you will speak of us, as of a dream. Is it ok like this? Excuse me, I was waiting for the cars to pass... We’ve no light. A very little flickering light in the distance shining at the road’s end... – here among us... – A very little flickering light not in the distance shining at the road’s end here among us with the crowd around une toute petite lumière just a little light una piccola... in all the world’s languages a little flickering light shining uncertain but shining here among us between the crowd’s warm breath the high wind of the hills and the breeze of the seas and the sour gust of those that don't see it only sense it and blow furiously. A little light that wavers precise that flickers firm that doesn’t light up hardly shines. They named it a voice listen to it and it is silent. Silent as precision as firmness as justice. Shining indefectible. Silent it doesn’t crackle, doesn’t consume, doesn’t cost any money. That’s not what costs money. Nor does it warm those who draw near from cold. Nor does it light up the faces bending over. It scarcely shines flickers wavers indefectible close golden. Everything is certain or false or violent: it shines. Everything is terror futility pride stubbornness: it shines. Everything is thought reality feeling knowledge: it shines. Everything is darkness or light against the same darkness: it shines. Since always or since never for always or not: it shines A very little flickering light silent as precision as firmness as justice. Only like them. But it shines. Not in the distance. Here among us. It shines. Between the crowd's warm breath the high wind of the craggy hills and the wind of the seas and the sour gust of those that do not see it Silent as precision as firmness as justice. For a country of stone and harsh wind For a country of bright perfect light For the black of its earth and the white of its walls For the silent and patient faces Which poverty slowly etched Close to the bone with the detail of a long irrefutable report And for the faces like sun and wind And for the clarity of those words Always said with passion For their colour and weight From which the named things spring For the nakedness of awed words Stone river flow house Lament day song breath Expanse root wind – Oh! My homeland and my centre The moon hurts me the sea weeps me And exile stamps the heart of time Born of the earth like a tree The burn of the earth confused in he And in the immense song of high tides The beat of his veins constantly resides Created according to the elements His soul and his sentiments Were not of themselves torments But huge, harsh, forsaken Lakes Reflected the world, And echo unreturned The ascent of earth into space Brought pounding to his chest Flourishing rhythm manifest In the gestures his arms trace I listen without knowing if what I hear is silence or God. I listen but I don't know if I'm hearing the echo of the empty expanses... or the attentive consciousness which from the edge of the universe... sees and deciphers me. I only know that I walk as one who is watched, loved, known... and that's why I place in every gesture solemnity and risk Poetry asks two contradictory things of people: One, to place ourselves in the void; the other, to place ourselves in communion. They’re totally opposite things and I think the character of a poem lies between the intensity of void and the intensity of communion that one desires and needs. It’s a play of contradictions. It's like... silence, or a blank page. And that kind of gymnastics, or asceticism, from that void is where we project what we understood through communion. Being pine tree with the pine tree, stone with the stone, wave with the wave. To write the poem as an ox ploughs the field With thought never stumbling on the meter... With nothing being diminished or banished With nothing between man and what he lives. The graspy shoes of light... night and it's flow of panic and peace Like one who seeks and misses his face Our civilization is so out of kilter that thought has separated itself from the hand Ulysses, King of Ithaca, carpented his boat... and also boasted of his ability to plough a straight foe in the field It’s said when Ulysses was tired of prodigious feats he cried with love to see his Ithaca, green and simple. And the art is in this Ithaca of green eternity not prodigious feats. Sophia, with her word and her accent, her truth, her vehemence and ecstasy and her essence, was the first figure in our history to bring us ashore on the isle of green eternity that Borges wrote about. So here at the moment, we’re taking apart a line from Proust to express a noble joy, unintelligible and precise. Muse teach me the song Revered and primordial The song for everyone Believed by all Muse teach me the song The true brother of each thing Incendiary of the night And evening’s secret Muse teach me the song That takes me home Without delay or haste Changed to plant or stone Or changed into the wall Of the first house Or become the murmur Of the sea all around I remember the floor Of the well-scrubbed planks Its soapy smell Keeps coming back Muse teach me the song Of the sea’s breath Heaving with brilliance Muse teach me the song Of the white room And the square window So I can say How evening there Touched door and table Cup and mirror How it embraced Because time pierces Time divides And time thwarts Tears me alive From the walls and floor Of the first house Muse teach me the song Revered and primordial To fix the brilliance Of the polished morning That rested its fingers Gently on the dunes And whitewashed the walls Of the house simple rooms Muse teach me the song That chokes my throat I’ve no voice, I have to read it again... I was in Delphi once, alone, a week or so, and I was torn between ecstasy and panic. In fact, the time I was there it was May, it was covered in poppies, there were lots of thunderstorms and the mountainside was full of bees, it was like the mountainside was buzzing. Delphi is... The Greeks thought it was the navel of the world the place where two eagles met and marked the centre of the world. And Delphi really is a place of extremes, a place of... of ascent and abyss, simultaneously. Haven't we passed the house, yet? Here it is. Here in Lagos I’ve been having a marvellous summer in this most limpid light, in this weightless, golden heat in this green transparent water and the invisible caves that are incredibly baroque, red and golden inside. In August when the sea is smooth and transparent I used to hire a skiff and go from cave to cave and swim in the cave of the Lion, and the Hall, and the Gate of the Sun and the Scales, with the kids beside me and an extraordinary boatman, a fisherman named José Vicente, who dived in and brought urchins, stones and shells from the sea bed and taught us the names of the fishes and told us the most fabulous fishing tales. This José Vicente became the idol of my children, he taught them to swim underwater, to jump, to fish. Bonsoir Vicente. Ah! It’s lovely! A lovely one, indeed! For you, always the best! It still smells of the sea. Thanks, Vicente! It’s lovely. You like it? It doesn’t mean much to me. Panoramas … It looks like these streets have shortened with time. Night’s like someone who descends, full of confidence … One creates a chair from anguish to attend nightfall When I was small, they told me stories of various stars not the story of the names they have and we know them by but a story where they were stars, real as the stars in the sky. Many times I just listened, that's all: to lean your head on the window sill and watch them twinkle, and stand out more as it grew dark. Many times it was just to accept the cold and close the window and when I was small, it wasn't me who closed it. I must salt it well... Like that, no? No! That’s not how you salt a fish! But you have to rub the salt against the direction of the scales... - so the flesh... - No! That spoils the flavour. Too much salt. Do it like this. Ah. Don’t forget your basket when you leave. Thank you Vicente. Good night... bonsoir. Bonsoir, good night. It’s enormous! You know, the devil always brings along someone for supper. What’s that? It’s the music from a film. Ah! That? It’s a fish! It’s lovely. My earliest memory is of a room facing the sea: in it, on top of a table, was a huge red apple. From the shining of the sea and the redness of the apple came an undeniable bliss, naked and complete. There was nothing fantastic, nothing imaginary: it was the very presence of the real I was discovering. Nothing was lost inside me. Nights and sunsets still pour Into the house and garden freely, Different voices still to the fore In my body intact they linger. I bring terror and I bring clarity, And in my every demeanour I walk towards one unity. I imagine what literary intrigues must be there. For these things you need philosophy, détachement and disdain. They don’t deserve a minute of our attention. If you can write and work, Let them speak. We have much worse here, once the intrigues are more dangerous and many peaceful citizens look at us with hate in their fat fascist hands. Fascists have horrible hands. Not even you can imagine what this presence of hate is like. I’m saying a little of the lot I’d like to, but as the characters in Aeschylus say: "I have an ox on my tongue." At a dinner a few days ago, they asked me what I thought of a fascist lady (a very brash one) who pursues me and Francisco with foul imprecations and slurs. I said I found her good, intelligent, cultured, honest and good-mannered. Even the friends of the lady had to laugh at that. It’s the only way: to laugh at those who want to kill us. Maybe life is the struggle of images that don’t die? Paris, March 1962 My dear Jorge, I’m writing to you from France, on the way back from Italy where I went to the Congress of the European Community of Writers. It’s two in the morning and I’m truly exhausted so this letter won't be as detailed as I’d like. I came from Lisbon thinking it was just a literary congress. What I found was a political congress. The atmosphere was edgy, full of suspicion. I felt really alone, in a world of intrigue that isn't my world. I really missed your presence there. The mood in Europe is one of violence, imbalance, passion, lack of serenity. I think more serious things are going to happen but this atmosphere of suspicion is serious enough as it is. I haven't received news from you for a long time. Please be very careful when you write to me. I don't know what my return to Portugal will be like. Today in Montpellier we were approached by a Spanish journalist who interrogated us very cleverly and intensely, speaking well of Salazar and Franco one minute, speaking ill the next. It was very strange. I admired how smart Agustina was, not to answer anything. I got the impression we were being followed. I’m almost afraid they won’t let us enter Portugal. I’m not afraid of being arrested but I want to enter Portugal. Meanwhile, I saw Florence. I think I could have seen it better: I saw it under skies they persecuted Dante by, burned Savonarola, insulted Michelangelo. The skies under which politicians betrayed each other and prostitutes made their fortune. Michelangelo dominates Florence with his profound bitterness and that great incredible grandeur which is the real measure of man. The mood in the city is such that the night of my arrival, still unaware of everything that was to happen I wrote a long poem that begins: Poetry imposes transparency. Dearest Sophia, Arriving from São Paulo I find your letter, undated: timeless lady! Here, Sophia, it’s like there. You have to use a knife, and endure the slashes. I’ve just been excluded, legally, from a doctoral professorship. I’ve lost my job and my patience. I’d already seen the goons take control of literature over there! It’s the inevitable result of the wholesale degradation of a country that’s totally lost, in its people and its things, its sense of dignity and decency. Let them take over, if they want and they can and we’ll look on from the stands, at the festival, for that’s what our place must be. We miss you immensely, but not the Portugal you have to put up with. 28 June 1962 Dearest Jorge, We, thank God, are doing fine, but with the usual tribulations you know about. My family, for the usual political reasons, has practically stopped talking to me. My old friends almost hate me. People are rare. As the P.I.D.E. has been searching my house and took away all your letters, I’m afraid the mail is closely monitored now. For P.I.D.E. read "police", political police. She wears a two-piece suit and cravat. She’s lost in the crowd, like the countless informers. It’s been said that Portugal is a land of silence. That’s the P.I.D.E., that’s the police for you. Yes, it’s everywhere, it controls everything. Is it very efficient? It’s very efficient and very well organized. It’s the most efficient thing in my country, I think. The best organized. If they’d made the same effort with education as they did with organizing the police, we would have achieved something. But alas, for education they’ve done very little. Yes. – A lot was done for the police. – Much more money is spent on the police than on universities in Portugal. You speak of fear, you speak of silence and one detects in this country a lack of interest in politics. Total. Is that the effect of fear? Yes. It’s the effect of fear. And the effect of habit. When you don't have the right you forget the right. It’s as simple as that. In depriving a country of information you deprive it of awareness. In the end, this country is deprived from being a homeland. Where there’s no awareness... A homeland isn’t just a territory, it’s an awareness. And when a country is no longer aware of itself, because it doesn’t know what’s happening, it doesn't concern it, it's not told what it's involved in. This country is deprived of awareness. Who witnessed much, who suffered, passed through sorrows, humiliations, work and sad hopes; and was betrayed, robbed, and was deprived in the extreme of rightful justice; who travelled many lands and nations, knew the world and underworlds as well; and lived within himself the love he’d had creating; who read all books and loved, who was all things knows nothing, even triumph is denied him in fortune as with everyone who lives. Not living is the only way he’d have it all. Restless and forthright, noble and loving, he’ll always be without a country. Death itself, when seeking him, shall find him dead. Jorge de Sena's house. It was the 18 on the 18th street. The Kingdom of Stupidity – wonderful title! But is it worth the effort, wasting so much intelligence in explaining to the dumb that they’re dumb? They’ve changed good for evil, to live is almost a crime. But though they hide all things and want me blind and dumb I won’t die before I find out what the colour of liberty is. Well... I believe we’ve been outfoxed! It’s coming in... Let's do this one. The light is coming. The constant danger of failing to be the great poet he was. A kind of madness for which talent is a poor word. You’re reading in Portuguese? Yes. It’s letters. Dearest Sophia, Forgive my silence if you can. But I no longer know how to bear all the work I have to do. Each day I think of the letters I must write the ones I love And every day I succumb to the weight of all I have to do. If I hadn't resigned from my post as director of the literature course I don't know how I’d be alive. Just today I sent the first part of my medieval studies to Ocidente. I wonder if they’ll be published? Besides my History of Literature, I have to submit my anthologies on Garrett and Pascoaes by the end of the year. I’ve just signed the contract for the publication of Pessoa. I’ve received two scholarships and made a critical edition of the lyric poetry of Camões. Next year, I have to leave for Rio de Janeiro to kickstart the Camões machine. I’m finishing a monumental study of Inês de Castro. I’m ending an enormous translation, because I need the money. On Saturday I have English Literature exams, on Shakespeare. Add to this the lack of money, the low intrigues of university life my disillusionment with the dirty tricks of the opposition, from which I have disassociated myself... – Let's say, I never accepted any party problems of any kind. I’ve never belonged to any political party and I don’t believe I ever will. The same way I’ve never belonged to football fan clubs, associations, etc. I’ve always been the least membership person in the world because I think that kind of association is the opposite of what I most esteem, which is people getting along together. I think that's much more important than people meeting to eat cod or to celebrate the birthday of Henry the Navigator, or even to save the universe, because there are many ways of saving the universe and all together they aren't enough – I hope this letter reaches your hands and remains there. I never thought the P.I.D.E. were so keen on getting my autograph. There remains the consolation of thinking that they only learned what they already knew, or even better, what they ought to know. My political stance remains unchangeable. I am not and never will be – unless I sign up with myself – a member of no party at all. I think the unity of all is essential, but... I increasingly think Portugal doesn’t need to be saved, for it will always be lost as it deserves. We're the ones who need to be saved from Portugal. – But there's no easy way, you know? – It’s true there's no easy way. Me, as a Goldschmidt! Who was it who said... Someone said: "A generation born in fear... arrives as a stranger in this world... and will never find the way home." It's these silly beasts, slugs. There we are. There's nothing. Are you going to eat? – Yes. – I’m coming. Sophia! Despite the ruins and despite death, Where all hopes always end, The force of my dreams is so strong That bliss is reborn from everything And my hands are never empty. My hands are never empty. Mexico City, 26 November 1971 Dear Jorge, I’m writing from the hotel pool, quite near a lady shorter than me in a 'douceur de vivre' a little unreal and exotic. I came here because it’s our wedding anniversary but also, out of a duty to see. Yesterday with Francisco we saw two prodigious pyramids. I went to the top of the Pyramid of the Sun. The pyramids have an extraordinary geometric imagination. The steps are so steep that when you’re going up you only see the sky and you think it’s the last level. But when you get to the top there’s another level, and another flight of steps. What’s coming is hidden. We accede to the final vision through stages of ignorance, or successive non-visions. All extremely complex. The art of these people is terrible, an art of terror and complication that never passes from the magic to the divine. The gods are like demons, like Chinese dragons, even. The serpent is a bird, the priest is a tiger, a bird, a butterfly. And everything accumulates. Above the mouth a trunk, below the lip other lips. Above the tongue another, above the head, feathers. Above the feathers, horns, arrows, banners. Surrounded by arms, discs, triangles that spin around the figure that we confuse with the tree, the ornamentation and other figures without quite knowing where one begins and another ends. There’s a kind of grimace that’s both cruel and festive. The fact they invented the zero isn't enough. All that blood deliberately spilled All this is the glorious reverse of the ending of errors. I don't know if it is. One day we’ll be free from death but die, all the same. It could also be: One day we’ll be free from death but live, all the same. One day we’ll be free from death but die, all the same. I’ve long planned to visit Mexico. But the truth is, apart from the pyramids and Quetzalcoatl, and what retrospective pity I can feel for Montezuma in his bed of roses the red-skins, even with the glories of the Aztecs, the Toltecst the Mayans and Incas, have never interested me that much. And it must be my liberal prejudice that makes me say they don't cause me repulsion. And as in my symbolic past I have no blame for killing them to civilize or suppress them, I feel perfectly immune to the silly compunction to admire rosettes of feathers. Texas Jack in my childhood was enough for me and in my maturity I soon got sick of the rubbish they talk about of Brazilian Indians. Not that the world isn't full of cruel, bloodthirsty gods, Sophia. All gods always have been, and still are, hypocritically so. Even after they’re civilized and sanitized and taught not to eat human flesh, which they have always eaten, one way or the other, I’m not aware that the God of Abraham and Christ ever protested about the aroma of roasting flesh. But gods that aren’t of love, even a devouring, destructive love are unspeakably low. At least the Chinese dragons you mention had the advantage of being emblems for the use of a people that knew from the start to uninvent gods and live without them. I hope to visit the Orient one day, even if to be honest I find myself so incorrigibly western that from Persia onwards everything is largely indifferent to me and exotic for exotic’s sake never appealed to me. Poetry is something else. Writing requires solitudes and deserts And things to see as if they were something else And things to see as if they were something else Palaces with that Roman air that peels years off the most modern buildings. And Bernini's fountain. All that water was his Roman monopoly. But elsewhere a column rises. And Santa Teresa, before the angel's arrow, comes penetrated into pubic flight, her habit rubbing and billowing in a pelvic thrust that endlessly explodes her. Dancers, thieves and gentlemen, here there’s only one shadow. The prisons of the Signoria and the thugs of the Doge who spy on the evening of the day. Apart from that, Venice is dancing, singing, fantasy. Every year the stories here are so varied they sometimes seem invented. So here I always say that Venice is like that city of Alexandria where there’s sun at midnight and moon at midday. A few days ago this happened to me: I began writing a poem in the afternoon but I kept getting interrupted, so I gave up. At night I tried to finish it but I was too tired and in a thousand pieces. The next morning I went with the cook to the market. And suddenly in the midst of fishes, cabbages and hens, I felt I had to stop for a minute, take a break, not have to think things out. So I sent the cook to buy the vegetables and escaped to the café and ordered a coffee at the counter. As I was drinking my coffee I recalled the poem of the day before and I asked the waiter to lend me a pen and paper. That’s how I managed to finish the poem in a mixture of calm and euphoria. Then I ran off to buy the fruit! That’s my life. But sometimes it’s all badly written and badly lived. Oh me! My heart is broken in seven pieces. When the evening lights reflect inertly on the green waters of Brindisi You will leave the wharf that bustles with words steps oars and cranes Happiness will glow in you like a fruit You'll go at the prow through the night's black shadows With no wind no breeze just a seashell's murmur in the stillness But the sudden tossing will remind you of the capes And as the boat rolls in the closed darkness You'll be lost inside the night inside the ocean's breathing For this is the vigil of a second birth The sun skimming the ocean will wake you in the vivid blue You will slowly rise like the resurrected You'll have recovered your seal your original wisdom You'll emerge confirmed and reunited Astonished and young like an archaic statue With gestures still furled in the folds of your robe I drove with Agustina Bessa-Luís to Brindisi, where we took a boat. We passed Turin, Milan, Venice, Padua, Verona, Ravenna and Florence. I won’t try to describe Greece to you or try to tell you how happy I was there. It was as if I’d said goodbye to all my misunderstandings. About Greece, only Homer... I won't try to describe Greece to you or try to tell you how happy I was there. It was as if I said goodbye to all my misunderstandings. About Greece, only Homer had told me the truth: but not all of it. The first marvel of the Greek world is nature: air, light, sound, water. It’s a mythological nature where the mountains and the islands have a blue halo that isn’t imaginary, but an objective physical phenomenon they already debated in ancient times. Under the high sun, in an indescribable blue clarity, the air is so light it gives you wings and the slightest sound stands out whole and clear. The enormous and constant mountains fill everything with solemnity. It smells of resin and honey, an austere and lucid inebriation. After the Acropolis, St. Peter’s seemed mundane and futile and heavy. I’d love to tell you all I’ve experienced from the astonishing taste of the wine with resin, that made me dizzy on the night of my arrival, to the freezing water I drank on a very hot day in the mountains of Delphi. But I feel I can scarcely speak about all this. What’s extraordinary there, is that the mystery is the sunlight! At noon on the Acropolis, with the sun at its peak everyone whispers. Even the tourists, so exuberant in Italy, are transformed. Italy amazed me too, but it’s different. Venice and Florence are worlds made by man centred on himself. They’re not religious worlds. In Greece everything is built as a connection between man and nature. In a way, in Greece I found my own poetry. "The first day whole and pure: showering horizons with praise." I found the world I no longer dared to believe in. Now I have the wonder of knowing it’s real and not imaginary. Here my words falter like someone Who, seeing a visible god before him, Goes on, bereft of imagination, speechless, In indivisible reality. Very good! That's very good! Look what I found. Oh! man, wonderful! Oh, what a wonderful thing! Where did you get that? In the tank in the ruin. It’s beautiful, man. – Look, I’m going to draw this. OK? – Yes. The tree is getting pretty too. Really? Do you like it? Yes. It’s this one, right? Yes. If you like it, we’ll swap: the painting for the skull. Deal. Araraquara, São Paulo, Brazil 12 July, 1964 Dear Sophia, I’m writing to thank you for your 'Greek' letter about my Metamorphoses that have something of Greece. And also to congratulate you for the poetry prize you snatched from me. Just a way of saying things, that jury full of commies would never reward me. Never mind. But I want you to know how happy I was for the prize to be yours. My disillusion with Brazil is total, and already was, and all we want is to get out of here. But where to? I interrupted this letter yesterday afternoon to go out for a drive with Mécia. And it seems a miracle we’re alive and in one piece. Would you believe on the way back, when it was already dark the car crashed at 55 miles an hour, flipped over three times, totalled, and I got everyone out of the car with just a lot of bruises. We ended up getting home really late. The sensation of being closed inside a rolling box, knowing we’re doomed is one of the most curious things. There’s no fear, nothing, just a strange expectancy. We’re resigned, yet alert. And now back to the letter. Europe seems more difficult. Brazil was never easy, and has become so unsafe it makes little Portugal look like child’s play. I’ve already resigned myself, and perhaps even prefer a more or less permanent exile, but I only desire a country that doesn’t speak our language, so I don't have to witness its degradation, which I’m less and less willing to bear. Madison, May 1966 Dear Sophia, We are fine. Adapting is necessarily complex in a world that’s entirely new. My health, which wasn’t too good in Brazil, keeps getting worse. I see that our correspondence didn’t manage to keep up with your transatlantic flights. Yesterday I received, with an immense and pleasant surprise, your letter from Brazil. Did you receive my book about Camões’ songs? My book of short stories is coming along so slowly it would try the patience of an army of saints. I saw your "Document of the 101" I thought it a beautiful piece, very serious, one of the few decent things the opposition has published. The university has offered me a permanent post. However, I don’t believe America will detain me with all its heroic and devoted liberalism. And besides, either things turn round here or we’ll have a kind of big-business military dictatorship, which will make life impossible. Without even realizing, I’m already thinking which my next country will be. I dream about Italy or Greece, but they won’t give me a job. I wonder if Japan will? I’ll put myself up for auction! City, street bustle and endless screeches, Oh dirty, hostile life, uselessly led, Knowing of the ocean and virgin beaches, Nameless mountains and plains more widely spread Than the most widespread desire, And I am closed in on you and barely see The walls and barricades, and I never see The ocean's tides or the moon's reaches. Knowing you'll take my life inside you And that you'll drag through the shadows and barricades My soul that was promised to White waves and green glades. Dearest Jorge, I’ve been reading the Peregrinatio during my own pilgrimage. Maybe that’s why I prefer the darker side of your book. "And in the stormy mist, suddenly nothing." Paradoxically, the poem I like most is Leave the Greeks in Peace. Although I believe we really have to start everything all over again from the Greeks. I mean: from loyalty to the land. I believe the worst thing about the Portuguese is, we always leave the Greeks in peace. That’s why we are a country that doesn’t identify with itself. A country that thinks bitter, downcast, vile sadness is the condition of man. We were a country of great navigators, but we never faced the world with that awed smile that the statues of the lonic sailors had. Greece is no derelict, extinct, barren past. Greece was never laid barren. How can the land of the fauns be barren? What’s beautiful in your poem comes from images and not concepts and brings to mind "whitewashed houses with black harpies." Hadrian’s Villa is one of the poems I like most. It’s a poem in a state of continuous construction and destruction in its will to face everything and tell you everything. Like someone who recognizes the ruin and builds the palace around it. An effort to seize something that cannot be seized. I’m more awestruck than you: I believe it is possible for us to coincide with other beings. This letter is pretty, actually. It's rolling! The amphora is wrapped by a silent space How do you interpret this? The amphora is wrapped by a silent space Like that autumn afternoon under the pines of Hadrian's Villa Suddenly, between the rustic houses, roadside, rural mountains and Tivoli, an invisible giant oasis. The sun passes through a spartan grove, green fields and walls, bathhouses, amphitheatres, lakes, and the long serene peace of Canopo where swans sail as ever they did. Palace, the empire in miniature, particularly the village solitude of guards, secretaries, servants, and gladiators, and a Herculean shadow, at once delicate and malleable, in whose brow snails entangle. Under the nocturnal weight of your hair Under the diurnal moon of your shoulder I sought the unbroken order of the world The unheard word Time of fine sand closely measured The centuries have toppled statues and walls I'll be destroyed by fleeting years In this ruined silence, shadows fall cold. Time and again under fire or glass I sought in your face The revelation of gods I don't know But the Emperor will live forever, along with the great dream of tranquil power in which even slaves are free and souls are bodies that fear only the non-salvation of being young and beautiful in life. But you passed through me As we pass through shade But suddenly I recover the ancient Divinity of the air between the columns Shall I read it again? What do you think? I think it’s alright, it's much more... Bathhouses, amphitheatres, lakes... and the serene peace the village solitude. No Sophia, there is no literal 'Greece' in verse that means something. The Greek gods were only naked in intimate moments, raping Ledas. Greece belongs as much to us as it does those people with their half-Turkish customs. I believe, contrary to what you say, (but you feel and don’t dare say it) that the betrayal started when Christianity stopped being a Palestinian thing, and stole half from the Jews and half from the classical world, to create two thousand years of shame. It was a colossal mystification at the expense of the gods, created by a politically treacherous and oligarchic collection of slave-trading, racist, supremacist cities, etc. Who invented democracy to falsify it. The Parthenon is a miracle that happened to them. The rest is thousands of years of talk. So, for example, The Iliad, which is wonderful, is horrendous to me too, an apologia of the bellicose machismo that even today drives soldiers to Africa and terrorists to bombs. And the lyric and tragic poets of Greece, despite centuries of scholarship drowning them, who still cry for freedom, and the poor Greeks, since 1453, don’t know what it is. Forgive this sermon: it isn’t meant to be one. Just the inescapable bitterness of one who loves life and freedom, and utterly hates the world he was given to live in. In a month I depart for my university conference 'tour'. At least I’ll breathe European air! I don’t know if I’ll go to Portugal this time. Just thinking about Lisbon makes my liver ache. Here goes a great big hug from your dear friend Jorge. Happy New Year! My homeland’s not ineffable. Life in my homeland is what’s ineffable. Ineffable is what may not be said. My life had taken the shape of the small square That autumn when your death was meticulously getting ready I clung to the square because you loved the humble and nostalgic humanity of its small shops Where clerks fold and unfold ribbons and cloth I tried to become you for you were going to die And all life there would cease to be mine I tried to smile the way you smiled At the newsagent at the tobacconist And at the woman without legs who sold violets I asked the woman without legs to pray for you I lit candles before all the altars Of the churches located on this square For as soon as I opened my eyes I read The vocation of eternity written on your face I summoned the streets, the places, the people That had been witnesses of your face In hopes they would call you in hopes they would unravel The fabric that death was weaving in you. This is the time Of the darkest jungle Even blue air turns to prison bars And the light of the sun grows sullied This is the night Thick with jackals Weighed down with bitterness This is the time when men give up. Cars pass by and the house trembles The house in which I am alone Things were lived here long ago: In the air are extinguished spaces The form engraved on emptiness Of voices and gestures that once were here But my hands can cling to nothing. Lisbon, 31 December 1967 Dearest Jorge, Sorry for the silence. But this has been a really tough year for me. My brother João (the architect) died of a heart attack on 25 June. He was 46. In August in the Algarve I tried to regain my balance and composure. But in mid-September I had to leave for Porto, where my mother was operated on a malign tumour. For two months I was in Porto, trying to connect my mother to life and madly deceiving myself. They were extraordinary, marvellous days in an extraordinarily warm and bright Autumn. I got lost when so very close To the longed-for garden A ballerina was I... But around 10 November my mother got worse and died on the 17th. She died in a kind of dazzled serenity and after extreme unction she told me: "I'm content". But despite everything, I believe she still secretly hoped to live. Unusually for this disease, she looked younger and freed from the weight and confusion of the years. To me, my mother was connected to the root of essential things. She’s one of the rare people to appear in my first three books, which almost contain only trees and beaches. Only time can help me clarify this separation inside me. Francisco and I are always thinking of you all. When will we see each other? I miss you not showing up for lunch. Hold tight your love between your fingers In this April garden where you draw breath Life will not return Your hands Can never gather from others the sweetness Of these flowers swaying in the gentle breeze. 938, Rowley Avenue, Madison 9 January 1968 Dearest Sophia, Taking advantage of a break from this insane work schedule I was going to try to write again, in this confusion of lost letters our correspondence is, when your letter of 31 December arrived. The news of your losses added to my depression with life and this world. Mécia and I are both very sorry and send our thoughts. Your brother’s death, especially, shocked me. Your mother’s was, despite everything, different, if death can ever be different from itself. The impression I have more and more is that, from a certain point onwards we start to live like Rilke’s angels: without knowing if we’re among the living or the dead, because people disappear, become memories and we remain in an ever-stranger unreality, where most of the living aren’t part of our world, they move in it like ghosts in the background while authentic ghosts keep gathering in the empty space, who are precisely the ones who have ceased to exist. Your children must be very grown up. Our older ones are sometimes too American for my liking which isn’t that of an immigrant made good. And that’s what hurts me in the Americas I’ve come to know. Countries of immigration, where the pressure for taste to reduce to the common denominator is huge. A sadness of emptiness. I’m sick of the Americas and it’s here I’ll have to live and die which is the irony of my life. An irredeemably European type like me, made American by destiny and still a Portuguese writer. Isn’t it comical? So, I was going to write to tell you that the University of Wisconsin has given me a term of paid leave in Europe. I’m finally going to Europe, after nine years of absence. And I’m counting on spending the best of my time with you and Francisco. 19 February 1969 Dear Sophia and Francisco, Now I see how terribly fatigued I was and how much I still miss you. This postcard comes to you from Halifax. How good it was to have you with me. I still haven’t read anything. I don’t have the head for it. Today I passed over the Azores: to the west, Graciosa island, then between Flores and Corvo, lost at sea – and Portuguese. What else could they be? Report Sixty cities (including the museums, streets, castles, cathedrals, etc.) in twelve countries in four months (very American) besides the manuscripts in various libraries, conferences in London, Paris, Brussels, Nijmegen, Utrecht, and the princes of Portugal (medieval and Renaissance) throughout Europe, and a few movies, exhibits, theatres, a lot of highly immoral carousing (most the desire less the occasions), and honest encounters with old friends and with new friends, a border incident, many interviews, public readings of poems, the warmth of glory (oh ephemeral, as Solomon already knew), a gall bladder operation. And on a rainy evening a departing ship. Friends under umbrellas. And a loss of words with those on board saying goodbye. And in the stormy mist suddenly nothing. Born in Portugal, of Portuguese parents, and a father of Brazilians in Brazil, I’ll be, perhaps a North-American when I get there. I’ll collect nationalities like discarded shirts used and thrown out, with all the respect owed to clothes one wears which have done one service. I am myself my own country. The country of which I write is the language into which by chance, from generations, I am born. And that from which I create and by which I live is this anger I have for the little humanity in this world when I don’t believe in another and only wish that this one could be other. But if one day I forget it all, I hope to grow old drinking coffee in Crete with the Minotaur under the eyes of gods free of shame The Minotaur will understand me. He has horns, like the wise and enemies of life. He is half bull and half man, like all men. He rapes and devours virgins, like all beasts. Son of Pasiphaë, he was brother to a line of Racine’s that Valéry, that cretin, thought one of the most beautiful in the "langue". Brother of Ariadne, they wrapped him in a ball, a really lousy mess. Theseus, the hero, and, like all heroic Greeks, a son-of-a-bitch, laughed in his respectable muzzle. The Minotaur will understand me, drink coffee with me, while the sun serenely sets over the sea, and the shadows, full of nymphs and unemployed ephebes, will gather sweetly in our cups, like the sugar we stir with a dirty finger sullied from searching out the origins of life. It is there I wish to find myself again, having left my life broken into pieces by the world, as that poor devil put it, whom the Minotaur hasn’t read since, like everyone else, he knows no Portuguese. Then again, I don’t know Greek, according to most reliable sources. We will speak Volapuk, since neither of us knows it. The Minotaur didn’t speak Greek, he wasn’t Greek, he lived before Greece, before all that learned shit that’s covered us for centuries, shat by our slaves, or by us when we were the slaves of others. Over our coffee, we will tell each other of our injuries. With countries we are bought and sold, in the absence of countries that sell themselves dear enough for us to be ashamed we don’t belong to them. Neither I nor the Minotaur will have any homeland whatsoever. Just coffee, aromatic, good and strong, not from Arabic or Brazil, Fedecam or Angola, or anywhere at all. But coffee nonetheless, which I, with filial tenderness, will watch as it drips from the bull’s chin to the knees of the man who doesn’t know from whom he got, whether father or mother, the twisted horns which ornament his noble brow, older than Athens and, who knows, Palestine, and hugely patriotic tourist spots. In Crete, with the Minotaur, without lyrics, without life, without countries, without spirit, with nothing and no one save my own sullied finger I’ll drink my coffee down in peace. Lord: I ask no more than silence I ask no more, Deliver me from the din; Not the din of cities, or of men, of waters, the din that erupts in the memory or twilight of deserted rooms. Deliver me from the din by which life with you will end, with a sudden tear that leaves me still and silent. The din where I will hear nothing more. The din where I won't move a finger. The din where I will be undone. The din where someone will close my open eyes. 14 April 1978 Today I was in Arezzo and Siena. For Rome I have a kind of hunger. Rome is gold and pink and red. Here with your friends we talk of you. Of my life, I don’t know what to say because I don’t know what I want. Maybe it isn’t the time to want anything. In part it was from distraction that I let my youth slip away. I thought the problems would pass, not the time. Send news. For you and Mécia a heartfelt kiss. Sophia What a shame you’re so far away and our lives don’t cross. So long is the path All those footsteps walked Only for him to find Every door closed So long the path For he travels alone And his wandering shadow Draws upon walls Under the midday sun Under the green lights The water of exile Is brilliant and cold All those footsteps walked Down streets of white Or down black roads All those footsteps walked For the love of the land Occupied country Where fear reigns In a closed room Doors close Eyes close Windows close Mouths shut Gestures withdraw When he asks No one answers Insults are plucked Solitude is harvested They turn away their faces And don't wish to see him His long struggle Is met with silence The silence of those Who become shadows To turn into monsters In that city So short of men. I tried to become you for you were going to die And all life there would cease being mine I tried to smile the way you smiled At the newspaper man at the tobacconist And at the woman without legs who sold violets Dear Mécia, I called during the day without finding you. I felt so distressed and wanted to hear your voice. Of Jorge I hear the great river of his poetry passing through the space and time I live in. And I can’t get over those eighteen years of absence that could have been eighteen years in each other’s company. And thinking of Jorge, dear Mécia, means thinking of you. They’ve been talking a lot about Jorge around here. There is, perhaps, remorse and alarm in the awareness they’re coming to of what he was. Now everything passed so far away and so quickly there’s a violence that’s difficult to accept. I want to write lots about Jorge, but only once I’ve managed to overcome the desolation of this initial stage. I need to completely understand that no journey can bring Jorge back. Now I can only tell you my distress and my immense sadness. A kiss from your good friend Sophia. Exhausted I flee the arena of the intolerably pure The gods of destruction sat down beside me The city where I live is rich with disasters Although the calm beach I dreamed of exists Come back afterwards! The ashen light is blackening the day, so pallid in the distance on the tiles! I barely see to write, and yet I may, the freest pain that guides my hand this way, it’s she who sees me, comforts me in trials. When reached that awful end that waits for me, no comfort will be mine to ask for. And this unfolded sheet of liberty will shroud my face. I don't even know if I think or if I’ll think when fleeing from myself The letters fade. Night, my love. Oh! my life, no words were said by me. For us, for you, for me, who spoke was pain. And pain is evident – when free. Splendour solemnly comes to rest upon the sea. And between two stones so perfectly upright that it could be here the Scales weigh the balance between mankind and things, the perfection almost blinds me, as when staring at the sun. But then the transparency of the green waters dilutes me and I dive in, touching the fast blue silence of the fish. From shape to shape I see the world being born and raised. A big red scorpion fish, beyond my imagination, passes in front of me. It’s like an extremely lucid awake dream. The images pass through my eyes and travel beyond me. Perhaps I’ll become like those jelly-fish which fishermen say is merely water. Behold the sea and the light, seen from the inside. Terror of penetrating the secret room of beauty. Terror of seeing what in dreams I didn’t dare to see. Terror of facing the images buried deeper than my own thoughts. – I didn’t cut. Did you cut? – Cut! It’s done! We can’t make another.
