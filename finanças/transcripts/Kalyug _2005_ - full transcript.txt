He is Ketan Shah. Your lawyer. He said that he'll release you from the prison. ''Bhashkar, l didn't say this.'' Till the time l'm not convinced of the convict's innocence.. ..l don't take up the case. ''Everybody out, please.'' ''Out, please.'' ''Bhashkar, you too. Out.'' Tell me something about yourself. - What? Everything. Right from the beginning. Since the time l've become mature.. l've known only 2 things. Fear.. and pain. 19th January 1990. That black day. When we Kashmiri Pundits had to leave our home and city. We became refugees in our own country. We lost everything. ''Sir, give me the luggage.'' Father came to Mumbai because he had wanted the world.. ..to know about the pain and sorrow of Kashmiri Pundits. His dream was that some day we'll return to our Kashmir. He was a social worker. ''Wait, wait, slowly.'' He used to believe that if you want to alleviate your pain.. ..then you should give solace to others who are in pain. For 16 years he worked.. that too without getting tired.. ..and without stopping. He always fought for his principles. And then one day suddenly.. Kunaldar. - Yes. Do you recognize this watch? lt was my father's watch. ln the crowd of Mumbai's local train.. ..his hands had slipped and he fell off the train. He died. His dream of returning to Kashmir.. ..flowed as ashes in the water. l couldn't even mourn. Because Mumbai is a machine that works day and night. lt doesn't give you time to shed tears. 14..15.. Rishi. ls he your instructor or you are his instructor? Go home. ''Kunal dear, come. lt's already 10 o'clock. Come.'' ''Come, dear. lt's 10 o'clock. Do you want to build muscles in one day?'' Do you want to close my gym? Let's go home. ''Tell me, which song do you want to hear?'' What difference does it make? When you do want to roar then use any language. Do l sing so badly? - You felt bad? Do sing. Sing. Shall l sing? - Yes. ''You made me a lover.. you made me a lover..'' ''You made me a lover.. - Shall l tell you something, buddy?'' Nobody can sing so badly with such confidence. Let's go. ''Hey! Hey! Come on, take out your money!'' Come on! ''Hey, smarty! What are you doing! Shall l hit you!'' ''Don't hit. - Come on, take it out.'' Give me this watch! Take out this watch! Hey! Don't hit! - Don't try to act smart! Hang on. Hang on. - Come on. You too take it out. Don't try to act smart! Give me the watch! - Take this. What do you say? Get lost! ''Go away, otherwise l'll thrash you.'' ''Let's go, Kunal. Let's go.'' This was.. what happened? lt's wrong. - What? ''Buddy, it was my father's watch. - So?'' l can't live without it. - So what will you do? Kunal! Where are you going! Kunal! ''Smarty, share it equally. - Leave it. Here comes that fellow.'' Hey! - Look. Get lost! - Keep everything else. Just give me the watch. ls the watch so expensive? Yes. lt's the last memento of my father. - Really? Yes. - Shall l send you to your father? Get lost! Kunal. - Look. Don't talk about my father. Kunal! ''Kunal! - Fatso, take him away from here!'' Let's go. Kunal! ''Kunal, listen to me! Kunal!'' ''Kunal, enough. Now stop.'' Take the watch. Leave me. ''Kunal, stop.'' Kunal - l was able to take back father's watch. But l understood one thing that day. To eliminate darkness.. we have to light the lamp ourselves. We have to wage our own battle. We only have to burn in it. Hello. - 26297661 . - Yes. There is a trunk call for you from Jammu. Please stay on the line. ''Hello, Mr. Pushkarnath. - Hello.'' ''Sir, this is Siddharth. From St. Joseph hospital.'' Since many days l've been trying to contact you. Hello.. look Pushkarnath is not there. l'm his.. l can't hear you. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. l've called to inform you that Anaz Renuka is now an adult. You were supposed to come to take her. ''Since you didn't come, the court has decided to send Renuka to you.'' ''Hello. Look, l'm Pushkarnath's son. And l don't know about any Renuka.'' Hello.. l can't hear you. - Hello. ''Sorry, sir. We have no other option.'' Renuka will come tomorrow by Jammutavi super fast. What? - She'll reach CST. Look.. l.. hello.. hello.. hello.. Hey! Listen. How long is Jammutavi late? You're the one who are late. The train arrived 2 hours back. What? - Yes. Renuka? ''l'm Kunal. Pushkarnath's son. Sorry, l'm late.'' No problem. l thought nobody will come. Pushkar uncle has not come? Maybe you don't know. But he expired 6 months back. - Oh. But l came here because of him. No problem. l'll go back. But.. l don't have money for returning. You don't worry about money. But do you want to return right now? l don't have any other choice. l don't know anybody else in this city. l'll return to Jammu. ''Fine. Come, l'll buy a ticket for you. Come.'' Take this. - Thanks. ''Come on, hurry up.'' l've got the ticket. But there is a problem. Reservation is after a week. No problem. l'll return after a week. l'll return your money as soon l reach there. But.. where will you live for a week? ''Here, at the station only. l'm used to living alone. Thank you.'' Renuka. ''Look, l can't let you live here for a week. You come with me.'' ''No, l'll manage to live here.'' No.. you come with me. l'll arrange for some place. l hope you won't have any problem. - Problem? No problem. ''Big problem. Big problem. - Okay, okay.'' ''Look, l'm telling you. No, we won't allow it.'' ''Aunty, but.. - Shut up!'' Girls are not allowed here! Understood! - No problem.. ''lf not girls, then you get guys. lf not guys, then you bring girls.'' What do you think! What do you think! - Aunty.. enough. How much will you scold! She is a decent girl. ''She is my guest. She has come from Kashmir, aunty.'' Only for 7 days. After that she'll go. - Oh! ''Come on, Delnaz. Let her stay here. She's such a sweet girl.'' Shut up! Such a sweet girl! Shut up! And you get out! And tell her to get out from here! ''Aunty, please. Where will she go? She has no other place to go.'' Do you think l'm an idiot! You pay rent for a single person and 2 people will live here. ls there an offer of one free with one? You're trying to act smart. ''Fine. l pay only a single person's rent, don't l?'' Only one person will stay. She'll stay here. Then where will you go? - l'll go to hell! Any problem! No problem. No problem at all. Any problem? Come. Actually.. nobody.. nobody visits this place. So that's why. And there is not much cleanliness. Just give me 5 minutes. l'll clean up this place. Will you bury me in the ground? - What? How much more will you make me feel ashamed? ''As it is, you're doing so much for me.'' And l'm banishing you from your own house. This is not so. l'm doing all this for my father's sake. He used to like it.. whenever l used to help others. But where will you sleep? l? There only.. where half the lndians sleep. ''Come on, Delnaz. lt's so late, go to sleep.'' ''Come on, come inside.'' ''Seeing you, do l have to sleep?'' ''Seeing you, do l have to sleep?'' ''Seeing you, do l have to wake up?'' l have to spend my life with you. You are my life. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. ''Seeing you, do l have to sleep?'' ''Seeing you, do l have to wake up?'' l have to spend my life with you. You are my life. My heart beats for you. ''Since a long time there have been many unsaid wishes in my heart.'' ''Since a long time there have been many unsaid wishes in my heart.'' ''Come and hear them. Cast the spell of love.'' ''Come and hear them. Cast the spell of love.'' Do listen to me sometimes. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. Forget it. ''Hey fellow, come inside. Hurry up.'' ''Why do l feel like l've loved you since centuries?'' ''Why do l feel like l've loved you since centuries?'' ''Come in my dreams and make me yours.'' ''Come in my dreams and make me yours.'' Do this favor on me. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. ''Seeing you, do l have to sleep?'' ''Seeing you, do l have to wake up?'' l have to spend my life with you. You are my life. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. This is your ticket. And water. There is something to eat in the bag. And keep 100 rupees. For your expenses on the route. 500 and 300. And this 100 rupees. The total is 900 rupees. l'll return it as soon as l reach there. Do you want to bury me in the ground? l want to tell you something. The happiness that you gave me in those 7 days.. ..l wouldn't have found that even in 7 lifetimes. l think life had some debts. And it repaid it to me through you. Thank you. Fine. l'll leave. Bye. Smile! Smile! ''Delnaz darling, at least open the lock of the camera.'' ''lf you don't open the camera, then how will you click?'' ''Shut up, old man. l do know. Smile!'' ''Now you click my snap. Come on, hurry up. Come on.'' ''Come on, hurry up. Come on.'' Smile! Very good! - Very good! Thank you. One minute. l'll send him back. ''What's the matter, buddy? - This is your wedding gift.'' What is this? Are you mad! Will you spend your first wedding night here? With uncle and aunty. This is Hotel Ceaser Palace's honeymoon room voucher. You'll spend your wedding night there only. ''l can't take this. - Fool, this is my gift for you both.'' ''Thanks, buddy.'' Hurry up. ''Yes, we'll have lunch there only.'' Welcome sir. Good bye. ''Hi. - Hi, sir.'' ''We have reservation here. - One second, please.'' Mr. Bhashkar gave this. - Okay. He said that you know about it. - Yes. ''So, see which room is available.'' Hi. Hema. l'm sorry. ''Take this, sir. Keys. - Thanks you.'' ''Hey! Give him honeymoon suite. - Okay, sir.'' ''Take this, sir.'' ''Your room is there, a bit upstairs. Thank you, sir.'' Come. ''Do choose from the lip, what is written on the lip.'' ''Do choose from the lip, what is written on the lip.'' ''Embrace me and immerse me in my heart.'' ''Embrace me and immerse me in my heart.'' Do recognize me. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. My heart beats for you. Renuka. What are you doing? What are you chanting at 2 o'clock in the night? Are you doing some black magic on me? Are you okay? l'll have to take you to the doctor tomorrow. ''My wife has become mad. At night, doctor..'' Can't you keep quiet for 2 minutes? You talk so much. How many times l've told you not to interrupt me when l'm praying. God will become angry. You never listen to me. But why this prayer so late at night? Am l going to die? May your enemies die! Then why all this? - Just like that. l felt like loving you. l felt like looking at you again and again. ''lf you see me again and again, then you'll get bored.'' Me? - Yes. - l'll get bored? - Yes. Before that l'll die. Now why are you staring at me? Nothing. l was wondering what will happen to this fool after me. What will happen? Will l live if something happens to you? ''l've told God, if you're not there, then even l'll not live. - Really?'' Yes. - Nothing like this will happen. We have to live here only. And we have to live a lot. We have to laugh and cry. And have loads of children. Loads? - Yes. Then we'll grow old. You'll become old. l'll become old. You know how you'll look when you'll become old? - How? And you'll scare me at night. Then you'll wake me up at night and say.. ''..God, God, without your teeth.'' And then you'll blow. We'll have loads of fun. Then? ''Then, what happened?'' ''For few moments, l don't know why but l felt..'' ..that the ocean of pain and fear has gone far away from my life. But what did l know that it will return as a storm. And destroy everything. Wake him up. - What happened? Come on. Get up. - Leave me. Take him along. Come on. Where are you taking us? Kunal. Renuka! Renuka! What have l done? Do tell me! Leave me alone! Leave me! Where are you taking us! Where are you taking us! Leave me! ''l told you, go inside.'' What have my children done! My dear children. O God! ''Smarty, get in! - Leave me.'' Get in. Come on. Sit here quietly. Sit. Why have you brought me here? Where is my wife? Where is my wife? Where is Renuka? l'm asking you all! Renuka! Don't shout! Keep your voice low! This is a police station! Not your father's house! Understand! Who is she? Who is she? l don't know. - Who is she? Tell me the name of your partner. - What partner! Tell me. - Don't touch me! What will you do? - Don't touch me! You won't give us the name! What will you do! l told you don't touch me! Beat him! You thrashed a police officer! Beat him up! You thrashed a police officer! Beat him up! Renuka! Renuka! Leave me! Leave me! ls this Kunal's voice? - Renuka! Are you all beating him? Why are you all beating him? Why are you beating Kunal? - Sit here quietly. ''Tell us, what is your rate? - What?'' Who else is with you in this business? Answer me. - What are you saying? So do you do all this for free? Which other girls are in this business along with you? What are you saying? l can't understand! ''You fool! Tell me, since when have you..'' ..been doing this wrong business? You don't understand? Now l'll make you understand. l'll just explain it to you. ''Get up, you smarty!'' Did you get scared! ''Come, l will please you.'' Will you watch a film? Film? Sexy film? ''lf you make a blue film, then you must watch it.'' This is our special lndian porn site. For all those lndians who love lndia. And for them we are specially getting them scandal site. That means real sex life. They are sex lives of those people who have no experience in it. Who go on their first honeymoon and.. ..shoot their own sex life with a camera. That we show uncensored. See it for yourself. So go and have a good time. ''Hey, you want a honeymoon suite?''' Any more? - Okay sir. Hey! What is this? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Please stop it! ''Renuka, the best moment for a female..'' ..the most precious time for a woman.. ..your husband has sold it and made a blue film out of it. Your naked body is being sold everywhere. Children are seeing your blue film on the internet and mobile too. ''Look Renuka, we will leave you, but not him.'' Listen to me and sign on the papers. Come on. Whom do you want to save Renuka? The one who says that you are into.. ..the business of blue films in partnership. No! He can never say like that. - He has said it! He has even signed on the papers. Here have a look! ''Look Renuka, he will escape from all this.'' But you will get stuck into it. ''Listen to me, sign on it. Come on.'' Come on. Don't get scared. Just sign. You should do as told to you. Renuka! Renuka! Leave me! - Catch him properly. ''Renuka, they are lying. Renuka, don't listen to him.'' They want you to give a testimony against me. ''Renuka, don't sign on any paper.'' ''Renuka, they are trying to implicate us.'' ''Renuka, don't listen to them.'' ''Renuka, they are lying.'' ''Renuka, they want to give false testimonies.'' Renuka! Don't sign on any papers. They want to implicate us! Renuka! ''Renuka, they are lying. Renuka!'' ''Renuka, l won't lie to you.'' Don't listen to them. They are lying. Leave me! Leave me! Renuka! Renuka! ''Renuka, don't sign on any papers.'' Renuka! Renuka! ''ln this manner, my life was taken away from me.'' People really ruined it. Mr. Shah. 18 years back terrorists had come.. ..into our homes and thrown us out. ''l was a kid at that time, so l couldn't do anything.'' But l can do something now. Against those who have made a blue film. Please get me out from here. That's it. We have just got the news that the court.. ..has given bail to Kunaldar in the blue film case. So then let's talk to Kunaldar. Come. ''Sir! - Sir! - Sir! - Excuse me, sir!'' ''Kunal, we want to know that the acquisition that is put on you..'' ..regarding the blue film.. - The acquisition hasn't been proved yet. My client is innocent. Did you understand? And as far the blue film is concerned. The people involved in all this can ruin even your lives tomorrow. But who are these? - Why are you asking us? Go ask the police. But who is this porn star Jennie? We don't know anything. We don't.. ..know who they are and from where they operate. ''Sir, please just one question. Please, sir!'' Hello madam! Hey get your ass off that table! ''Jennie, where do you think you are going?'' l need to speak to her. You can't go in the boss is busy. You can't go.. - l said l need to speak to her. That guy is now out of prison. - Which guy? The same guy from lndia whose blue film is on our porn site. You said nothing like this will happen. l will.. l will take care of it. Don't worry. - Oh ya! ''Simi, we need to talk. We have a big problem.'' ''Not now. - Oh no! Simi, we need to talk.'' lt's urgent. Or else everyone will get killed. Later.. in the evening. ''Ma'am, please one question! - Please!'' Today we have Mrs. Simi Roy who will talk about the.. ..future plans of the FTC after the sudden demise of her husband. ''Good afternoon, ma'am. - Good afternoon.'' l would like to thank all of you especially my fellow lndians.. ..and all our supporters and all those who have invested in FTC. What did l tell you? What did l say to you? l said.. look at me you fool! l had told you that for the next seven days don't try to meet me. lt has not even been 24 hours since my husband's death. Tanya has her doubts now. You idiot! So what should l do! Jennie had come. She was saying that.. ..the lndian government has started an enquiry. And your master plan has failed! A huge havoc has been created in lndia. And our contact in the police department.. ''..ACP Jadhav, there is an enquiry made on him too.'' So? What happened? ''You know, we only had planned all of this.'' We only had put these cams. And we had got that guy arrested. ''And yes, this female would commit suicide.'' This even l wasn't aware of. ''But look at it this way, Vick.'' We have got enormous publicity and that too at no cost. ''That guy has been released on bail, Simi.'' Now it is really enough! ''Listen to me, stop the business that..'' ..we have started on honeymoon couples. ''l don't understand, Vick.'' How am l going to compete with Playboy.. ..Beate Ushe and Penthouse sites? ''You know Vick, if my husband couldn't stop me from all this work.'' ''Then what do you think, will l leave all this?'' ''But Simi we.. - Relax, baby! Relax!'' ''Look, tell Johnny to take an off for a few days.'' And ask him to come here. This guy can't do us any harm. ''We are too big. So calm down, Vick!'' Even after going away from you. ''There is still some part of you left in me.'' ''Whenever l remember you my eyes go moist.'' Even after going away from you. ''Life, l am still alive without you.'' There is only pain within me. ''l don't want to take even a single breath without you.'' ''Now it has become a habit to live like that.'' Even after going away from me. ''There is still some part of you left in me.'' ''Whenever l remember you, my eyes go moist.'' ''Kunal! Kunal, what are you doing?'' lf you don't sleep then you will go mad! Did you find anything about that manager? Police says that there was some manager.. ..like this but he is not there now. l think they will shut the case too. Kunal! Kunal! Kunal! ''Even in the darkness you are with me every moment.'' ''ln the brightness too you are with me every moment.'' ''To forget a heartbeat from the heart is not easy.'' ''Now it has become a habit to live like that.'' Even after going away from you. ''Tell me, where will l find him? - l don't know. - Tell me!'' ''Tell me, where will l find him? - l don't know. l haven't seen him.'' ''Sir, he can be found in the City Bazaar.'' l have seen him there once. ''Whenever l remember you, my eyes go moist.'' ''How is your business? - lt is fine, sir.'' ''How much? - 50. - ls it? - Yes, sir!'' ''Now it has become a habit to live like that.'' These thoughts! Come back to me! Remove them. Delete them! Now it is like a habit. ''Yes, Shah sir. Kunal has found some things..'' ..from the manager of Ceaser's Palace because of.. ..which this blue film sandal can be completely taken care of. Yes we have got a bag in which there.. ''..are tapes, an email and some cash.'' The email is from Zurich. lt is written that.. ..the manager should come there as soon as possible. And there are a few tapes of new honeymoon couples. ''l think they are the same tapes, sir. l am sure.'' ''Yes, the email is with me. l have read it myself.'' ''Yes, it is in my hands. Okay sir. Okay.'' Kunal! Kunal! Kunal! What are you doing? lf we would have taken this to the.. ..police then.. - What will the police do? What will it do! They will arrest a few other innocent people! The will harass them and hit them! Police is involved with them. l have seen that with my own eyes. And this law of ours can't do anything to them. ls it? So the law can't do anything? So then what will you do? Will you go to Zurich behind them? ''Yes, l will do that.'' They will have to pay the price for what they have done to me. ..l will ruin them. lt's fine if l have to give my life for that. ''Hey there, baby! What about us?'' ''100 franks that's all! Come on, please! Hey, you freaking man!'' Your lips are juicy. My heart is thirsty. l find your body very heavenly. Quite good! Your lips are juicy. My heart is thirsty. l find your body very heavenly. 10 franks please! ''Hello! Sir, will you take a doll. She is as good as a lady.'' Where will l find her? ''Sir, that is very old fashion.'' ''Sir, the fun that is there in the doll is not there in a lady anymore.'' A girl leaves and goes. She betrays too. But a doll will never leave and go. ''Buy it once and you will be set for the rest of your life. Buy it, sir.'' Where will l find this girl? ''Sir, now the profit that we earn by..'' ..selling a film is not there in selling a girl anymore. l will give you a discount. l will give you this for free with it. ''lf you want to earn more money, then meet me outside.'' Hello baby! - Hey! Hi there. What is your name? - Ali. - Where are you from? Actually my dad was from Lucknow but l am international. How much do you earn? ln a week 200 to 300 franks. ''l will pay you 2000, help me find that girl.'' Are you a policeman? - No! l am a journalist. l am doing a research on the sex rate of blue films. ''Especially, what is the role of these lndian females in these?'' And why only this girl? 1000 franks now. And the remaining after you make me meet her. ''Fine, buddy! l can do anything for money.'' But listen to one thing. lf you are within.. ..limits then you will make profit. ''And the place that you are going to, it is hell.'' ''You must stick to your work, Journalist sir.'' When do we have to go? - l wake up in the night. So we will go then. Stop the tramp! Please stop the tramp! Hey! ''That chick there is really hot, man!'' ''Hey how is business doing, man!'' ''Hey sweetie, how you doing? - Hey!'' Hey you let go! - Leave me! Leave me! ''When ever darkness prevails sneakily.'' Then the moon comes out from.. ''..behind and spreads light all over.'' Everywhere there is intoxication. ''But still the heart is thirsty for something.'' ''When ever darkness prevails sneakily.'' Then the moon comes out from.. ''..behind and spreads light all over.'' Everywhere there is intoxication. ''But still the heart is thirsty for something.'' ''There is happiness and at times sadness.'' ''Sometimes there is a smile and at times the eyes are moist.'' ''Buddy, live every moment with a smile.'' ''You have to go through every kind of weather.'' Fun and anxiety all prevail here. ''Enjoy them, beloved.'' You get out. - Everywhere there is intoxication. ''But still the heart is thirsty for something.'' ''Simi, the great lndian image that you portray.'' Come and see your daughter has come to Tantra. And that too with her girlfriend. Come and take her or.. ..else our empire won't take time to shut down. Take a fag. Have a smoke. Find your beloved. Who says to be alone. Loneliness is not good. ''You are thirsty and a drink is there too.'' ''Have fun with them, beloved.'' Everywhere there is intoxication. ''But still the heart is thirsty for something.'' Leave me! Leave me! - Hey you! Stop! Leave the child! Hey! l said leave the child and go. Hey! ''What happened, Michael? - l think we just hit someone ma'am.'' Shut up! What else is going to happen tonight! ''Michael, quickly get him. l can't be seen. - Go! Go, get him.'' He was just running but this car dashed him. What's wrong? What happened? ''Come on, hurry up! Shut the door!'' Come on Michael. Let's get out of here. ''Hey! Are you ok. Listen, relax!'' We'll take care of you. You'll be fine. Are you listening to me or not? What have you done to yourself? You drug addict! You had gone to Sin City! You take drugs in front of everyone. Till now you are intoxicated! And you want to drink more! What is wrong with you? ''Tanya, your father and me have worked so hard for all this.'' And it's for you baby! lt's for you. Who were you with? Who.. were.. you.. with? - Jessica My girlfriend. Listen to me! And you listen to me properly. l am a very modern woman. But l can't give you the permission.. ..to make love to another woman. l really have had enough of all this. Your father has just died 15 days back. And you are.. Have some respect for your dead father! Respect? What respect are you talking about? l should respect my father. And you.. l know what you have done. How did his death happen? Tell me! Who gave him an overdose of sleeping pills! ''Shut up, Tanya!'' ''Keeps your hands off me, you Simi Roy!'' You have a boy friend and you.. ..portray as if you are sad on my father's death. l will kill you! l hate you! - Get out! - l will destroy you! l hate you! l will kill you! l hate your face! l hate you! l hate you. l am sorry about all that. No ma'am l am sorry. l overheard your personal talks by accident. lf l knew then l would not come that side. What is your fault in this? You didn't see me getting insulted on purpose. At times l wish l were in lndia. May be l wouldn't have all this. But l would have a well-cultured daughter. ''Any way, how is your arm feeling now?'' ''l am fine, ma'am. Thank you very much. - Good.'' From where are you? - From Mumbai. l am Rajeev Chawla. May be that is why you didn't recognize me. l am Simi Roy. l am the head of Swiss Telecom Co-operation's head. But l am very normal person. And what is my reach; l try to help lndians with that. That is why l got you from there. - Oh! That is why l am.. ''By the way, can l ask you what..'' ..was a person like you doing in Sin City. ''Ma'am, l am a journalist.'' l am getting a story ready on.. ..lndian's in pornography and sex trade. Ma'am you are here since a long time. Do you have any contacts? l was wondering if you know.. l was wondering if you know.. You have asked me a very weird question. lf you would have asked me that about a charitable.. ''..lnstitution, any school, any college or a holy temple.'' Then may be l would be able to help you. But passion.. dot.. l am sorry. l don't know anything about it. You are right ma'am. Thanks anyway. l will leave ma'am. Mr. Chawla! - Yes. Listen to my advice. A story is not necessarily the way it always looks. ''Whatever is seen on the outside, inside it is not the same.'' Be away from this world. lt's hell out there. Taxi! - Bell View? Vick! You and Johnny come to me soon. lt's urgent. O my God! O my God! Again he has come! ''Leave this place, Ali! Come on, leave!'' ''Ali. - Look, why are you following me?'' There is so much space here. Go and sit there. ''Here, there. l'll leave. - Ali, listen..'' ''Look, l don't want to work with you. You're a mad fellow.'' You're making me a fool. You're a journalist. Journalists drink alcohol like me. They sit at home and work on their computer. They are not shot like you. ''Look, buddy. l'm scared of death. l don't want to die.'' At least not for a 1000 francs. l know. That's why l'm come here. Take this. Your remaining money. This is my battle. l'll fight it alone. l can't bear the burden of another death. Thanks. Hey! What a man are you! People don't pay even after working. And you're paying me without doing any work. Who are you? Sometimes l feel.. that when people cry.. ..then God feels very happy. Otherwise why would this have happened to you? Listen to me.. and go away from here. Start a new life. You're locking horns with very influential people. Forget all this. - Forget everything. Forget the humiliation that these people gave me? Forget that child of 13 years old? Who is forcibly brought here? Forget her helpless innocent eyes? Forget that today.. right now.. thousands of.. ..people's personal lives are being pried upon. They are being shot so that.. ..it could be sold in this open market. So that this billion dollars porn industry runs smoothly. ''You can forget it, Ali. But not me.'' l was so nicely drunk. Now l've become sober. My head is spinning. Take your money. ''When l'll finish off your work, then l'll take it myself.'' Let's search for your Anne. Kill Anne. ''Have you gone mad, Simi! What are you saying!'' Ma'am is right. You only had told me that.. ..fellow has come here searching for that girl. lt's right. Kill Anne. So that he doesn't reach us. What has happened to you both? We're businessmen. We're running a company. And now we'll have to become murderers. ''Leaving the business of blue films, we'll have to murder others.'' What is wrong with you guys! ''Yeah, Vick. You're right. We're businessmen.'' And this is my business. ''For my business's sake, if l can murder my husband..'' ..then l don't need to worry about this petty thing. ''Okay, Vick. You just leave this thing.'' ''Johnny, you'll do this thing for me.'' l need a true man for this work. And not a faggot for this job. ''l'll do this thing. l'll do it, Simi.'' Here. We've reached your Anne's house. ''3rd floor, 305. Green park Apartments.'' Thank you. ''Hey, buddy. Take this. Car's keys. You'll need it.'' ''lf you're alive, then we'll meet again. Greetings.'' Help me! Help me! Please help me! Get in! Who are you? Where are you taking me? Who are you? Why don't you answer me! Stop the car! l said stop the car! Who are you? Who.. Who are you? Who are you? - Get out! Who are you? - Get out! Who am l! Look! Recognize me! ''You tell me, who am l! Come on!'' l'm the person whose life you've ruined! You killed my wife and you ruined me! ''Come on, tell me. Who are your friends in lndia Passion?'' ''Come on, tell me. Tell me! Otherwise l'll kill you!'' Tell me! - Kill me! Kill me! l'm tired of running! l'm tired of being beaten! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Who runs lndia passion? Who does the business of this lndian porn world? Who brings these ordinary girls from lndia to here? And on whose bidding had.. ..you anchored that movie? Vick. Vikram Garewal made me do all this. l don't know who runs this website. But l do know that many influential people are involved in this. They only run Sin City. But why did you do all this? For money? How much money do you earn? 1000 dollars? 2000 dollars? Why did you do all this to me? Not for money. Do you want to know why l did it? Do you want to know? The earthquake in Gujarat destroyed everything. My house.. my family.. my God. The destruction everywhere around me.. ''..killed my devotion, my God.'' ''Under these circumstances, my uncle gave me shelter.'' And one day when l returned home. What is the need to count? Do count it. lt feels good. One.. two.. ''There is heavy rainfall, isn't it so?'' Did you repair your umbrella? Actually.. l.. l mean.. ''Sir, forgive me. l'll just come.'' Why did you throw the money like this before the guests? Do you know this is the disrespect of Goddess? ''Anita, do you know who these people are?'' They are very affluent people. Their business is spread from here to foreign. Do you know? And they are offering you a role in movies. Do you know? Come. Come. You sold me. What? - You're my uncle. You consider me as your daughter. You couldn't even provide me with meals. Meals! Meals don't come cheaply! From where will l get the money! From where! Government relief money is already over! Meals! Hitherto l've been selling household items to feed you! l'd 10 machines! 10! Now only 1 is left! From where will l get the money! ''Now l've nothing else left to sell, my God knows this!'' lf nothing is left to sell.. ..then will a father sell his daughter? ''Hey! Hey, tailor master. lt's 3 45.'' How long will your drama of crying continue? Come. Come. You don't have to stay here. Now you come with me. Come. ''Will you come obediently, or do l have to tie you up?'' Taking me away from my village. Johnny first made me sell my body. Then when he came to know that business of blue film.. ''..is more profitable, he brought me to Sin City.'' And he sold me to Vick. Since then l've been doing.. what Vick made me do. ''l've committed a crime, Kunal.'' l know that l'm your culprit. And for this you can punish me in any way you want. This thing of yours amazes me. This thing of yours amazes me. ''lt was my story. But your heart cried.'' ''lt was my story. But your heart cried.'' ''Why does he look different from the crowd?'' l see God somewhere in your heart. ''You were able to understand my tears and wounds.'' ''Your behavior has made me feel emotional.'' lt was my pain that you lived. This thing of yours amazes me. ''lt was my story. But your heart cried.'' Hello. - Ali. ''Hey, buddy. Where are you?'' Do you want to earn more money? This time l'll pay you double. What else is left in this world apart from money? l know. Listen. Anne told me everything. She is trapped in their net. She doesn't even know who the owner of lndia Passion is. Vikram Garewal. Vick. Give me the address of this man. ''Fine. - Hello. Are you fine, buddy?'' First class. Meet me tonight at Paradiso club. - Fine. l'll come. Your work is done. You're a sensible guy. You'll progress a lot. l wish even l was so sensible when l was young then l would.. ..have had much more money than what l have right now. But remember one thing. And know it well. You don't know me. You have never met me. l hope you understand. - Fine. Just one more step. And all this will be yours. There is a saying that if everything is working out.. ..as per the plan then something does goes wrong. Are you going to ditch us? ''No, Johnny. Don't you know that l do everything for money?'' Relax guys. This is the place. Paradiso. Let's go. The journey from here is only for me. Keep this. Return to your house. From the time l've become mature.. ''..nobody has given me anything for free, Kunal.'' Not even a penny without touching me. And you.. ''l can't take this money, Kunal. Please.'' No need to feel burdened by this. l'm not doing any favor. ''Before meeting you, l used to feel that..'' ..my suffering is the greatest. Only l've seen injustice. l'm not giving you anything. Lighten the burden of your heart. Thanks. Rocking place. lsn't it so? All our three works are done here. Eating.. drinking.. and dancing. ''You sold your conscience for how much, buddy?'' What? Don't try to act smart. Where are they? Hey! l don't believe this. ''You knew that we're here, still you came here to die.'' ''Not to die, l've come to kill you. - Really?'' Johnny-bhai. Johnny-bhai. Johnny-bhai. ''Johnny-bhai, listen to me. Johnny-bhai.'' ''Johnny-bhai. He is just a kid. Johnny-bhai, listen to me.'' Johnny-bhai. What are you staring at? Kill me. ''lf l survive, then you'll die. Fire the bullet!'' Johnny-bhai. Johnny-bhai. Johnny-bhai. l don't like bloodshed. ''After l go, kill him, beat him, cut him, do whatever you want.'' My work is over. Give me my money. l'll leave. l'll give! l'll give! - Give it right now. First let me fulfill his wish. ''What a shot, Ali!'' Ali! ''Sorry, Johnny-bhai.'' ''Hitherto, l'd done every work for money. But not today.'' Ali's conscience can't be bought. ''Hey, leave him. Leave him! Beat him, Kunal. Beat him!'' ''Today, don't spare him! Beat him!'' Shit! Hey! Kill them! ''Kunal, leave him! No, Kunal!'' ''Kunal, don't be mad!'' We'll deal with them later. Let's go! Come! Kunal! - Leave him! ''Kunal! Let's go, Kunal!'' ''Ali, leave me!'' Go! No! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Bring the cab! Ali! Your friendship was too heavy for me. lt wasn't a betrayal! lt wasn't a betrayal! ''You awakened my conscience, buddy!'' Fine. Now at least l'll be able to meet God's eyes. Ali! Nothing will happen to you! Nothing will happen! Listen to me. Listen to me. Simi Roy. Simi Roy runs this business. Simi Roy. Don't spare her. You have my oath. God is with you. God is with you. O God! - Ali! Ali! O God! Ali! My friend! Ali! So as you can see our company has done.. ..extremely well in the last financial year. Our stocks are booming. And our business has nearly doubled itself. And l can safely say that we're well on our way.. ..to become the number one company. And to let you know more about our company.. ''..ladies and gentlemen, Mr. George.'' The police have found the corpses of Johnny and Ali. That guy is somewhere nearby. And he can reach to us any time. ''l saw it in his eyes, Simi. He's not going to stop.'' Let's leave Zurich. Let's get out of here. Let's go. ''Vick, why are you a man only in bed.'' l don't need you. You're fired. There's still time. Come to your senses. Your madness to become the number one.. will one day kill you. Good bye. ''Hello. - You were right, Simi Roy.'' The story is not what it looks from outside. lt looks different from outside.. ..and is something else from inside. Your guise of decency will not save your reality for long. My dying friend told me everything. And.. ''Wait, wait, wait. What is your name? Kunal.'' ''Look, listen carefully to what l have to say.'' And l was the one who got you arrested for marketing of my site. But your wife committed suicide. l'm not responsible for that. People who watch blue films are responsible for this. This is the rule of demand and supply. ''lf there is a demand, then we have to supply for it.'' ''lf not me, then somebody else will do it.'' ''So don't take it personally, son.'' ''This is the modern time. Here, one's pain is show for another.'' You do one thing. Come here. Let's meet. We'll try and sort it out. Money is that cure that can heal all wounds. ''No, Simi Roy.'' Now l'll make your state same as.. ..what you've made of the rest of us. ''l'll speak your language. l'm coming, Simi Roy.'' l'm coming to get you. ''Sometimes we have to become bad to do something good, Kunal.'' ''Believe me, l'm not doing this for you. l'm doing it for myself.'' Hi. What are you doing here? l've come to meet you. Let's go. ''l recognize you, you rascal!'' Aren't you the one who had crashed with my car? Why the hell are you following me like this! What do you want? What do you want! Go ahead. Shoot me. But by doing this you'll lose the last chance.. ..to take revenge with your greatest enemy. Enemy? Yes. Simi Roy. l need your help to ruin Simi Roy. - How? Hello. - Simi. Simi there is a big problem. ''What happened, Vick? - Simi, that Tanya..'' Vick. Stop crying like a child. What happened? ''Simi, you didn't watch the T.V yet.'' Simi put on the god damn television. Switch on the T.V and see Simi. - Okay Vick. What do you have to say about the sex scandal? Was the sex scandal about your daughter? What did you say? What is your connection with Sin city? What did you say? What's going on? Who let them in? - What is your connection with Sin city? Who let them in? Get them out of here. Get them out of here. Get out of my house. Get out. Get out. Everybody out. This time carrying a video of Tanya Roy. Daughter of STC head Simi Roy. Reports are still sketchy as to how the video reached the site. And has a part in Sin city. Here's a look at the shocking video. No! What the bloody hell is happening? Vick. Damn you! Bloody hell. Vick. Vick. ''You saw Tanya, on T.V, on my site, my daughter.'' Vick. You bastard! Shut down the god damn site Vick! Shut it down. Why are you trying to shut down the website now? Whatever you wished for is happening now. The number of hits is increasing. ..the No.1 Porn Site. Now where did the custom of your market disappear? And what about the policies of demand and supply? ''The agony of one person becomes fun for others, Simi Roy.'' Now your agony will become a joke for the whole world. Understood. ''l hate you. l'll kill you, you bastard.'' You used to have great fun by making blue films of other women.. ..and showing it to the world without their knowledge.. ..didn't you? ''And now, when your daughter is doing all this..'' ''..with her own wish, you are suddenly acting like a mother.'' Why are you looking at me like this? Yes l did it. ''l did all this. You took the life of my father, right.'' Because he had tried to put a stop.. ..to your business of blue films. That is why l did it to get back at you. How l wish l could you kill you? l wish l could kill you with my own hands. ''l'll kill you. l'll kill you. l'll kill you, you bloody bastard.'' l wish l could fire all the bullets of this.. ..gun into your body. But l remember the values of my dead father. When somebody has seen someone.. ''..dying in front of him, he cannot take the life of anyone.'' Not even of a witch like you. ln this unusual incident of modern times.. ''..yesterday night in Zurich, Tanya Roy killed..'' ..her mother Simi Roy who was the head of.. ..Swiss Telecom Communication. The main reason for this death is due to the fact that.. Come soon! - What is the matter? The Mumbai high court took an important decision.. ..by releasing Kunaldar and stating him as not guilty. And CBl has been ordered to do proper investigations.. Mr. Kunal's lawyer is now with us. Kunal has not only proved himself innocent.. ..but he has also freed all those Asian girls.. ..who were trapped in this porn industry due to helplessness. And in which they were doing business of sex. Thank you. Do you know that this girl was waiting for you.. ..the whole night with this flower. ''Not only that, all the girls here, who have got freedom..'' ''..because of you, are praying for your long life.'' When is your flight? - ln an hour. Now what are you going to do? l don't know. Suddenly l have got freedom. l really don't know what l'm going to do. ''Leave me, you're happy right.'' ''You know Jennie, when l came from lndia to here..'' ..l wanted to take revenge against those people.. ..who ruined my life. Now even after completing that objective.. ..l don't have peace. Today l understood that father used to say the right thing. That to remove pain from your heart.. ..remove the thorn causing pain in other's feet. Will you come with me?
