He's like, I'm a Lance Corporal, you know? Staring off into space. Staring out into space. But I don't know if you gotta pay, usually they've got a sale on, but I don't know. I'm sure you could put on layaway and still get the 10 percent off. But most of the time if they give you the deal, you gotta buy it right out, like my shotgun, I had to buy, pay off completely to get the deal. Yeah, they said you don't put it on layaway you're not gonna get the 10 percent off. Ten percent off it was like 470 dollars. Over and under, American Arms. Oh yeah, overseas.

Shooting and popping off, go down, sit down... third Sunday. So what else causes it? Bad day at work or something? He was over there digging a shallow grave or something. A shallow grave? And then we seen him cover up the body. You guys have to rough him up or anything? Just go for it. Well, you know how these guys are, scumbags. And I mean, I'm assuming that's his wife, so. I doubt if anybody else would be that mad at her. ..gun should go over there in the hoot, sir... Tell you the truth, I kinda can't watt... You take off, you stop, you grab off to the side. ..these boys there, they started beating the shit out of her. He tried to scalp her, but he didn't do a very good job. Real nice night out here tonight. I'm tired. What are you gonna be doing after this? I don't know, what are you gonna do? Depends. Depends on what? Hey, O'Hara... - In a hard cell. - Yeah. He's still gonna do the time, they ain't gonna ever let you out of there. Big house either way you look at it. They'll just kick your ass out. He was trying to cover up. Right in the back of the car. Not the smartest guy. I think everybody could see if she was in the back seat, 1 don't know what he was thinking. You would think this freak would have stuck her in the trunk. The temperature is 55 degrees, the relative humidity 80%, the barometer stand... So she got porked down right in the stomach. - Son of a bitch, fucked her up man. - Yeah. With highs that will be in the upper 50s and Jow 60s for most areas. I'had a dream last night. I was dreamt I was walking through this big house. It went on forever. I walked through rooms and rooms and rooms. At the end, there was a door, in the door there was a room. An auditorium and a stage, balconies of seats. And I looked up to the top, it was like nine stories high. I walked up to the top of the balconies to look down, and it umed into a space shuttle, flew away, everybody was gone, and I was gone. Robbi? I don't even know this marine's name. This way. Dispatch, dispatch. Sending, over. We've got a Charlie Delta Jane Doe. Roger that sir, out. This body's really starting to stink. I don't know, maybe she was cheating on him or something. I have no idea, but he tore her pretty bad with that knife. Obviously there's really something wrong with this guy. 1 mean look at how he carried the scene out there. He's fucking out of it, he's gone. Yeah, I wouldn't think she'd put up much of a fight, I mean, considering the size of that bad hoy there. Good morning. Morning. What time is it? 7:30. Where you going? She's knows she's gonna get money out of him. Digging a grave out here with an E-tool. I mean, it's daylight out here. Yeah. I have a meeting. I have a few meetings. Pretty hot day. Mhm. Its really clear. I'm assuming that's probably his wife. She was probably cheating on him or something. I'l call, and see what everybody's up to? Uh-huh. Either that or she gave up the fight. Blood all over the interior of the car. A truck or something drives by, it's pretty obvious. I don't work until 4, is it alright if I stay around here? Pretty noisy up at the barracks. Okay. Mirror mirror, on the wall. Who's the fairest one of all? She doesn't have any wounds up front... It couldn't have been a pistol, it didn't leave any exit wounds, we know that. Wonder if she put up a fight or not. I have no idea, her hair looks pretty mangled. She looks mangled overall. He got her from behind. Hey you guys know what a, you know what made these wounds? There isn't a reason for somebody to be out here like this at this hour of the morning. - I'm waiting until... - This guy, his lifes over. It really never, there was never real travel in the dream, it was just, I was there all of a sudden, and I knew I was in New York for some reason. - Rest in peace! - So we just had no clue where anything was at, but we knew we had to be there... Gall of goat and slips of yew. ..fo different places, we'd eatin bars or something. - Rest in peace. We bumped into that, we kept on bumping into people from my childhood... - Peace! The Charm's wound up! ...maybe high school, or kids around the neighborhood. And finally we ran into one guy, and he said he had a lot of room in his hotel, so... You right now. You fucking stupid motherfucker. Fucking look at that pussy. Look at that! Come here! It was probably his wife, maybe it wasn't his wife, maybe it was his sister, or... It got out of hand I guess. I don't know, 1 don't know how it came up... - Rest in peace! ...we just knew each other. So, we just left right away. You know we talked to him, he said, "You can stay here." - My little spirit see. We were like, "Fine." She may have fought back. You guess his wife or what? She looks pretty small. The Lord is my shepherd. - So we finally end up in the building we were supposed to be in, it was like a fever house... - Rest in peace! Goodness and mercy shall follow me... When we were walking up there was just, crowds of people walking toward us... - With our Holy Charity. -...sfraight onto us. - Rest in peace! Yeah we found him, he was out there about 50 meters, so we had alittle... Obviously not the world's smartest marine, you know what I'm saying? He give you any trouble - Yeah. -...when you first found him? Yeah, I roughed him up a little bit. 1think this guy's a wise guy. Now they're doing card tricks... Thou anointeth my head with oi. The other woman's just running around... - My cup overflows. ...doing nick nacks and stuff. The Lord is my shepherd. Finally I just knew I wasn't supposed to be there... - He makes me lie down in green pastures. -..50 I just left. So that goodness and mercy shall follow me. And I finally made it back to the hotel room... - Surely goodness and mercy shall. -..and my friend from... -..with roses... -..this guy, that, we knew each other... -...all the days of my life... I shall dwell in the house of the Lord... -...from back home or wherever we knew each other. -...Forever, Amen. And then he was telling us that the management put more people in the room for some reason. Looks like he stabbed her a few times. Huh? Huh? They're coming over there, they're trying to figure out what's going on. But they kinda like the show that's going on. So they're just staying with us. Now we're just walking down the street. - Rest in peace! Alot of people coming with us, so we didn't know what to do, and we didn't have any plans, but I said... You fucking see this? Do you fucking see this? Huh? You fucking like that don't you? Huh? Get in there. Get in there, motherfucker. - I didn't to be with them... - Rest in peace! - Rest in peace! -..and I was trying to get away... in a foggy cloud... - Rest in peace! You fucking hear me? Where'd you find him? He was over there digging a shallow grave or something. Stuff like that so... Were they dressed up? Just kinda casual, just like a normal person. - Lullaby... ...and goodnight... - So they didn't have costumes? No, not at all, just regular jeans, jacket, type of thing, blue jeans, maybe slacks, and-- You fucking like that? You fucking like that? Huh? You fucking like that? Do you fucking like that? - Surely goodness in mercy shall follow me. -...my cup overflows... I shall dwell on the house of the Lord. - Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me. -..and we came up on the back streets of... He leaves me beside still waters. .. Thou art with me. -..there's a guy chewing gum... - Restores my soul, my life. - He just makes this big bubble gum kite, with all these different bubbles... Do you like that?

Flinch, so I can fucking break your neck. With all the blood on him... Ithrew the wallet when I was searching her, I threw the wallet at the Captain's feet, 50 she's probably got the ID. Hopefully she's got it. Any ident... What about the body? Any ID on her? -No. - Got a ring on, 0 I imagine that's his wife. She's bad, but... He got all the violence out on her. Now at this point there's just a lot... - Forever. -...of people on the streets... Rest in peace! ... lost my friends from here. I wonder how long we've been out here today? Start fucking talking!
