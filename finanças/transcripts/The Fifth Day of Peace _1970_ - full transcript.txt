GOD IS WITH US Units of the German army are surrendering one after the other, leaving in the Allies' hands, 100s of 1000s of prisoners. Germany is in chaos. The situation is worse than at the end of World War 1. At that time, the semblance of a German state with a regular government, an administration still able to function, succeeded in surviving the military collapse. Now, however, the Third Reich is disintegrating into total disorder. The endless lines of German prisoners head towards the Allies' rearguard to join the millions of civilian refugees waiting for food, water, medicine, shelter. The end of what was one of the strongest armies in history is now only a matter of hours away. Meanwhile, endless rumors circulate regarding the fate of the former Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. Line up! Quickly! Quickly! Sir! Communication from Emmen. The first contingent of German prisoners will be here tonight. Do you already know how many? - 3000, Sir. Maybe more. Thank you. This story is true. It happened in Holland, during the early days of May, 1945, the last days of the second World War. What are they supposed to be? Latrines? How it stinks. It'll take tons of DDT. They're solitary confinement cells, George. How much I'd give to see them go to work on those German pigs. A wish which will never come true. We don't do things like that. Get rid of that junk. - Yes, Sir. Get up! Come on! I can't go on! I'm hungry. Why? We'll never make it back home! Never! We'll never make it! Platoon! Line up! What a glorious career: Promoted to warden for services rendered. Lieutenant Carlyle, Sir. - Second Lieutenant Ranier, Sir. I'm the medical officer assigned to the camp. - Ah, good. You'll be busy here. Well, what are you waiting for, Gleason? Don't pile them up outside. Get them into barracks. Yes, Sir. Fall in! And I don't want anybody about tonight! Follow me! Sir, excuse me, General Stoffel… Staffel… I didn't quite catch the name, wants to speak to the camp commander. He wants to speak to the camp commander? Send him inside with the others. I'll talk to the general when I've time. Tomorrow, maybe. To the barracks! Get to the barracks! What'll we give them to eat? The trucks haven't arrived yet. Tonight they'll hafta skip a meal. C'mon, you listed an extra case of whiskey. You make me slave even at night. I think I won't because I don't like you. What do you want? That you put down a case of whiskey for me too. Ugly fool! Are we ready, Corporal? Jelinek, come here a moment! Wait a minute. Hey, comrades! Wake up! Take these two to the camp. They're German soldiers. Soldiers? Ensign Bruno Grauber. Corporal Reiner Schultz of the Volksgrenadier, 284th Regiment, 2nd Company. Deserters? They showed up here starving. I've never seen anybody eat so much. He's here! He's here! There, in the spotlight! The spotlight there! A pistol! Move those bloody lights! - Turn the lights away! Come on, turn 'em away! Why weren't they searched? They could've been carrying an arsenal! There wasn't time, Sir. - What do you mean? Do it now! Now? - Now! Or are you tired, Lieutenant? Sergeant, search the barracks! - Yes, Sir! - Gleason! Barrack by barrack! I want them out here, stripped and searched! One by one! Got it? Yes, Sir! - Good, move it! Yes, Sir! Get moving! - Get him out of here. All on the lorry! Get out! Everybody out! Alright, you, strip down! Strip down, I say! The officers, Sir. - Officers? The German officers, Sir. They refuse to strip and be searched. What do you mean they refuse? Go back there. Follow him closely. Colonel von Bleicher, I'm the highest ranking officer now. Major Brandt. - Captain Bosch. Captain Werner. - Lieutenant Stahl. - Lieutenant Waschel. Captain Miller. I've given orders for a search of the barracks and your men. That order includes your persons. We have no other arms, Captain. No exceptions, Colonel. I give you my word as an officer. I'm sorry. - Captain! Allow me to remind you that it is our right to be searched by an officer. Lieutenant Romney, will you take care of that, please? Hey! Are you drunk? What the hell's going on? Get back into the barracks! We gotta unload quickly. Call the others. - What others, Corporal? The others. All the service workers must reinforce the sentry duty. Sorry. Damn it the hell! I need 10 men. I ask for 8 with the hope of getting 7, they give me 6… and as soon as I turn my back, they take them too. Can you give me a hand? - We're drivers. We're busy. Keep up the good work, Jelinek. We're going beddy-bye. Go on, sleep! You'll be back, asking me for favors! Damn sons of bitches! Ah, here are my helpers! Well done, boys! The storehouse is in the back right. Good job. In the back. Everybody, barracks! One moment, Trevor, listen. They gave me two Germans down there at the depot. Deserters or something like that. They're in civvies, Corporal. Why tell me? Send them to the barracks with the others. No, you don't understand. I'd like to keep them a day or two. I need the help. I can't take it anymore! - Get going! Tell Malley. Don't ask me for authorization. I don't want to know about it! Hey! Hey, Trevor, wait! Aw, go to hell. Come on. Come on! Now it's raining. Damn it. I feel like I'm smashed to pieces. Did you get a look at our friends over there? Those bastards are sleeping in a few inches of mud. Yeah… It could've been worse for us. We must hold on to this warm place to sleep. And then… home, Schultz. You think so? It seems almost impossible. What's bothering you? Tell me. You never talk. You never laugh. I'd like to know what's to laugh about? Ah, right. Just look at this weather! Here you go: something to change into. Soap. A brush. And razor blades. Wake up at 5:00 and be ready at 5:30. Uncle Jelly wishes you goodnight! Hey, Corporal! Thank you. We'll pay it back in World War III. Who authorized your attempt at escape? No one, Sir. We just thought, who knows for how long… we just wanted to go home. I'm not interested in your excuses! The command of this camp is the only who can decide that. Right? And when the time is right for an escape and who can do it! Is that clear? Yes, Sir. Your stupid gesture could've made your comrades' position very difficult. But you didn't think about that! Did you? - No, Sir. Soldiers! This will serve to remind you that even in this place, even at this dramatic moment, you are still members of the Wehrmacht! None of you can conclude a private peace. At this time, our sense of discipline must be firmer! And our devotion to duty… must be absolute! Sing! Everybody sing! Sing! Get back! Get back! Make way! Get back, goddamn bastards! Hurry up! Everybody out! Everybody's needed! Hurry! Don't stay here! Out! Be brave! Everybody out! Make way! I said make way! Get back! An innocent chorus, Captain. And your men made use of firearms. All this is inconceivable and in glaring contrast with the international regulations of the treatment of war prisoners. You weren't authorized. Authorization is needed to sing a military anthem? You don't want to understand me, Colonel. You assembled without permission. So far no limitations have been imposed regarding freedom of movement within the camp. But if you would like to agree on some sort of regulation, I'd be happy to discuss it. I have no intention… to discuss anything with you, Colonel. I'm forced to insist. There are many aspects concerning the condition of this camp which I had decided to ask… - Make out a detailed list of requests. I'll see what I can do. The list is ready, Captain. Whitewash, brooms, carpentry tools, DDT, medicines. Needles and thread? A soldier who neglects the condition of his uniform is a bad soldier. You will surely agree with that, Captain. Yes. Yes, certainly. Very well, I will agree on… the needles and thread. Fine. My medical officer will call on you before tomorrow morning to see to your other needs. My medical officer has already arranged to set up an emergency infirmary. What we need are medicines and cots. The Canadian Command is responsible for the camp's sanitary conditions. Tomorrow morning, you'll receive a visit from my medical officer. To your left, right, left, right, left! It smells so good. What kind of tobacco is it? Hey, friend! Don't run away, please. Keep smoking near me. Come here. Come on. What do you want? The smoke. Let me at least smell it. Send the smoke my way. I've been smoking dry straw and grass for 3 months. Please. Wait. Thank you, friend! How do you light it? Hey, Schultz! What is it? What are you doing? Can't I smoke a cigarette in peace? Smoking, you damn idiot? Get over here, the boss needs us! Move it! Quick! Did he call you "Schultz"? Then you're German? Hey! Schultz! What are you doing there? Hurry up! Don't make me wait! Yes, we're coming! Don't make him mad. Come on! Get in! And you want me to believe these wounds were caused by barbed wire? Of course. Look, I've seen many wounds caused by barbed wire. These are quite different. Schroeder? Yes, Sir? How did you get these wounds? On the barbed wire fence around the camp, Sir. I was trying to escape with Corporal Olberg and four men. You see, Lieutenant? I must thank you, Captain. As you see, we've put everything you've given us to good use. Idleness leads to brooding and brooding leads to a lack of discipline. Right, Captain? What is it, Ranier? Captain, were you aware that six men attempted to escape the other night? I gave orders to stop them. The men were duly punished. To be exact, they were whipped. By whose…? - All units interned in this camp are subject to the rules of the Wehrmacht. And the Lieutenant is mistaken. Colonel, I demand this never happens again under any circumstance! No further attempts at escape will be made in this camp. I assure you, Captain. Captain! I'd like to advise Canadian headquarters that we're drawing up a list of the internees: name, rank and serial number. In the event that they'll be able to communicate with their families in Germany. Well, as you can imagine, communication with Germany is rather difficult. Everything in due time, Waschel. Perhaps it'd be easier to get from these gentlemen a football match? Football? You see, Lieutenant, it's a very popular game in Germany. What would you say, Captain, to a game between the Germans and Canadians? I think there's already been a game. And the winners were us. Hey! Hey! Catch this! It's for you! What are you up to, Grauber? I lived on their charity for 8 months. I wanted to repay their kindness. 8 months? You mean you ditched your uniform 8 months ago? That's right. You see how long I waited for you. You took your time, eh? Why didn't you tell me from the start? If all the Germans were like you, we'd all be home by now. Hey, what about you, kid? When did you desert? I didn't desert. I lost contact… - Contact with my regiment! I'm not a deserter. I love war, Sir! Every morning, mommy fed me bread and war. That's why I'm so cute and strong, Sir. Heil Hitler! - Stop it! Women? Hey! Hey! Welcome! Canadians! Stop! Stop! - No. No hitchhikers. Want to see how I round up a group of civilians? Go back! Back! Now forward! Forward! Hey, want a lift? - No, thanks, I live nearby. And you? - We can't. We gotta go home. I'll take you home after! Can I have a cigarette please? Ah, thanks! What? All of them? - Sure. - No! Oh, sure, we have more in there. Yes! Uncle Jelly says yes! We'll give you cigarettes and a lift. You know you have lovely eyes? My name is Jelinek and you? - Georgia. Georgia. Georgia! Get in, Corporal. Hey, who'll drive the truck? - I will. You think only you know how to? We're pimps now? Look, you want to go home or not? Do you think you won the war? Is there any chocolate left? Yeah, right away! Georgia, for you. But it's too much. Thank you. Are they Canadians too? Bye. Bye. Why don't we meet tomorrow? I could bring my friends too. They're very pretty. They work with me. Well, of course. But of course. Sure, you can bring them. So long! Then we'll see you tomorrow, Georgia. - Bye. Hey, Canadians. Let's go. Come on, get in! Evening, gentlemen. - Sir. Good idea, Sergeant. This will warm things up. I hope you've been looking after our guests, Romney? They won't talk to me. I don't rank high enough. Only to the commanding officer. Well then, what's new, gentlemen? If I may, Captain. Here are the list of requests. A list in less than 24 hours. OK. That means I lost. 2,727 men and 53 officers. We've taken the liberty of keeping a copy at our registration office. Should there be any need for checking or modification. Excuse me. Sergeant. Check it name by name. Right away, Captain. - This work… must be done by you personally. - Yes, Sir. I fear you'll be more crowded than expected. Why, Captain? I was told of the arrival this week of another group of prisoners. May I ask these gentlemen something? The gentlemen will be happy to answer any questions you may have, Sergeant. I'd like to know if the two Germans working in the kitchen are on the list? That's the first I've heard of it. Are you sure they are German soldiers, Sergeant? Were you aware of this story, Captain? Hush and behave. Halt! Go to HQ right away. Romney? It's about those two. Yes, Sir? Give them their uniforms and report to the Captain at once. They didn't have uniforms when they handed themselves over, Sir. They sort of volunteered and I thought… Stop thinking, Jelinek, and do as I say. Yes, Sir. We had a good deal going on there, didn't we? I'll bet you'll be glad to return to the flock. Police? Military police in here? They must be crazy around here. Name, rank and unit. Corporal Reiner Schultz, 284th Volksgrenadier Regiment, 2nd Company… Stand to attention when being questioned! Place and date of birth. Hassel, February 3rd, 1928. Say "Sir" when you answer, Schultz. Yes, Sir. Date of enlistment? - October 4th, 1944, Sir. Volunteer. Race? Aryan, Sir. Ensign Bruno Grauber, assigned to 3rd Coast Guard Division, 3rd Regiment, 7th Company. Born in Bremen, December 26th, 1928. Enrollment, January 10th, 1938. Drafted. Race: Aryan. Just a moment. Major Brandt has some questions. I don't see you wearing your ensign uniform. Under what circumstances of combat, when and where, were you separated from your uniform? I don't remember. I really don't remember. Is that right? Put that in the record too. And you, Corporal Schultz, when did you abandon your uniform? It was… It was during the rear guard action. I lost contact with my unit for reasons beyond my control, Sir. We burned a farmhouse and then… Tell me about your uniform, Corporal. It was in order to make it easier to escape enemy capture. I see. And was it to escape enemy capture that you surrendered to him? When, exactly? 3 days ago, Sir. Ensign Grauber and I did all that we could to avoid it but… We were dying of hunger. Are you familiar with the order issued on March 5th by General Blaskowitz? All soldiers found detached from their units who claim to have been dispersed are to be summarily tried as deserters and punished according to wartime laws. It is on the basis of this regulation, and the results of this interrogation, that I find it necessary for you to be referred to a court martial for the crime of desertion. Have you anything to add? The investigation is closed. Yes, I've something to say. Investigation? Court martial? Where? In here? You bloody fool! I'll smash your head! Idiots! Bastards! - I'm not a deserter! The war is over! It's over! - I'm not a deserter! The war is over! I'm not a deserter! The war is over! The war is over! THE WAR IS OVER! IT'S OVER! IT'S OVER! The war is over… The war is over. The war is over! IT'S OVER! Malley! Yes, Sir? If you don't help me, I'll start growing in these boots. - Yes, Sir. THE WAR IS OVER! Come on, Schultz! You start shouting too! THE WAR IS OVER! Stop it! STOP IT! I shouldn't have listened to you. I shouldn't have listened to you. You're not taking this farce seriously? Tomorrow, leave it to me. You'll see! Bastards! Goddamn clowns! Hey, Schultz? What's wrong? Have you gone crazy? I'm cold. I'm cold. I'll talk to the Canadians. They're the bosses here now! I'll talk to the Canadians! They're the ones in charge! Wake up! Come outside! Come outside! Wake up! Hey, there! Hi, Edwin! - Hi, Edwin! You draft dodger! - How are you? Look who's here! Hi, Mark! Come in! Now, you'll see! - Check this out! Come in, boys! - What a villa! How are you? - Where are the ladies? What a place! Hey, where do you hide the girls, eh? What brings you here? Check this out! Genuine Russian vodka! A personal gift from General Malinovsky! You, Miller, have no right to ask questions. Drink, choke but don't talk. It's not allowed. Take your glasses. Tell him whose idea it was first to flush out this, this draft dodger? You! - That's right! Me! Gentlemen! To peace! To peace! To peace! - To peace. Cheers. That will put hair on your chest! Boys! Just like the academy. - Yes, Sir! What do we have here? Top secret? Move it! - Let it be. Officer cadet, sit down! Immediately! - At your commands. Major Macdonald, report! News bulletin! We'll start with the smallest, if you don't mind. Did you think, traitor, that they buried us under a bit of land, down in the black woods? Yet here we are: alive, healthy and victorious! - And promoted. Wait, let me speak. It's me who must tell him. Now he has been promoted for a glorious wound in his arm! Bullshit. - Silence! Reported to have fallen down the HQ stairs on a night like this. Instead we two, we two have been promoted for… for… Why did they promote us? - Because General Snow liked us. You traveled so many miles just to tell me that? Face forward! 1, 2, up! You're not happy to hear this news? With our promotion, the old Europe has nothing to fear. So now celebrate with us, Captain Canadian Crap, got it? Or we'll play a mean trick on you. Come on, if you don't want to end up in prison! We're already in prison. Oh, he's jealous! He doesn't want to celebrate with us! Mon capitain! - But what you don't know… and what nobody knows even now… and what must be kept as the strictest of military secrets, is that peace… is just a matter of hours. Old soldiers never die. Never die! Never die! Old soldiers never die. Old soldiers never die. Never die! I saw it myself. I saw two slim limousines with 4 stars on their flags. And inside a Wehrmacht general brought by the Russians. Then in a great hurry arrived Betel Smith, the officer in charge of signatures in full security. Maybe it's all over by now. The problems will come after. Germany: 80 million people or at least what's left of them. What are we going to do with them? And the Soviet tank divisions in Vienna and Berlin? What if they give us orders to push on? Gentlemen! Change enemies, advance! What the hell's the matter with you? What did I say? Nothing to say? We shall do what we're ordered to do. Forward! Canadians! We're in here! - Follow me! Canadians! Hurry up! Get us out! They already got them in there. I can't without a key. - Break it in. Whatever it takes. It's forbidden to damage the installation unless absolutely necessary. That's the rules. Here. You want a cigarette? I don't smoke. Hey, Sergeant! I've got to talk with your commanding officer. It's serious. Forget it. Mandatory orders. You'll hafta settle this among yourselves. But you're the security patrol. - Why does that matter? Go on. Out with it! They put that other guy here to spy on me. I've got to talk softly. Come here. Come a little closer. Listen. There are some things, I don't want them to know. Secrets, understand? I'll smash your head in! Now you got "absolutely necessary" reasons to break the lock! Go and call the others! Do your duty, Sergeant! For all I care, you can stay there till you rot! We got a sworn deposition from Corporal Jelinek about the date. They gave themselves up without uniform. - Good. There's no doubt of desertion. At a range of 10 paces! Move it! Move it! I protested against these offensive safety measures. On the contrary, Major, it's perfect. It's as though they were collaborating. This may constitute an important precedent. Of course, Colonel. Perfect. We want to say something, Colonel. Give them what they deserve. And then leave them to us. I will not tolerate any excess. The work of this court martial will proceed in an atmosphere of order and discipline with complete respect for military regulations. This will be a trial… not a lynching. They're a little excited… but everything's under control. - Good. Gimme a hand. Thank you. Have you noticed anything since this morning? No, why? My God! You're right. No planes. What does it mean? Maybe it means… peace. Aren't you glad? Of course. Very glad. Tell me, George… what did you do before? I mean before the war. Architect. Just remember that if one day you need to build yourself a house. You'll have to wait until I'm a general. That'll take a longer time, I fear, in peace time. I'm gonna go call HQ and see if I can get through to them. I'll let you know. Keep an eye on them. The charges are as follows. The named, Reiner Schultz and Bruno Grauber, both members of the German armed forces, at their own initiative, deserted their respective units. They threw away the weapons and uniforms that the fatherland entrusted them with and evaded combat by wearing civilian clothes. And lastly, with extreme cowardice and treason, surrendered to the enemy troops, going as far as voluntarily offering to serve in a Canadian army unit, in order to gain in exchange petty personal advantages. It is moreover assumed that these acts were carried out before May 4th, the date on which the German high command issued general instructions for the surrender of troops, and found themselves in untenable tactical difficulties. Do the defendants have anything to say? You bet I've got something to say. I shit all over this stupid farce. You think you can still order people around? You're trying to change this camp into a barracks. The war is over. It's over! This is a prison camp! We're all in the same boat! The only difference is that I'm a civilian. Look at them! Look at my clothes! You're not getting me to snap to attention anymore. It's you who had better pay attention! I've had a good look at all of you! I'll remember all your faces! Every one! And if we ever get home, I'll find you, one by one! I swear I'll make you pay for this! Clowns! Bastards! Cowards! Stinking sons of bitches… And you? I'm not a deserter. My lieutenant could tell you that. Is your lieutenant here in the camp? No, Sir. Lieutenant? What is it, Malley? Later. Everybody must report to the captain. Later? When? - I'm just about finished here, Sir. Huge news. And it these fools who are making it so long. This trial is taking place under exceptional circumstances. And it is impossible for the defense… to acquire all the elements necessary… for the operation of its duties. I therefore submit to the judgment of the court. A candle, Waschel. Having examined the documents, the court united here… finds the defendants, Bruno Grauber and Reiner Schultz, guilty of the crimes ascribed to them… and sentences them to death by shooting. You're just a bunch of clowns! - I'm not a deserter! You've made a mistake! You've made a mistake! You've made a mistake! Make way. Make way! Get back. I said get back! Get back! Back! And now boys, the captain wants us! Big news! Come on! Let's move out! We're going home! The war is over! Hey! Put me down! What the hell are you doing? I didn't end the war myself! The Canadians! Hey, Corporal! Hey! Hey you, with the death sentence! Can't you hear? Answer me, you moron! Know why the Canadians are singing? Because I was right! The war is over! How much you wanna bet? Going home to drink beer! That's it, boys! We're all civilians! And that fanatic up there… If I see him in civilian life again, I swear I'll break him! As sure as my name is Bruno Grauber! I'll slaughter him! Thank you. - Sir. Thank you. Show him in now. - Right away, Sir. Colonel. Good morning. As you can see, I'm on my way out. It's a delicate and urgent matter, Captain. It won't take much time. Malley, go see if the jeep's ready. And wait for me downstairs. Yes, Sir. Well, Colonel? The court martial presided over by me… yesterday delivered a death sentence against the deserters, Grauber and Schultz. I know. Very well, Captain. But we can't arm a firing squad without guns. And? And I am asking you, Captain. The word "guarantee" might seem ridiculous, almost offensive to soldiers. Even so, I give you my honor that… - Colonel! Whoever said you Germans didn't have a sense of humor? We must execute this sentence, Captain. I've got a general waiting for me. I don't intend to be late. Open the gate! Captain, you can't humiliate by a refusal, the prestige of a military tribunal. Listen to me, don't try to tell me what I can or cannot do. Why not? I'm a soldier like you. What the court decides has nothing to do with the war. Oh, it doesn't? - No. My position as the loser and yours as the winner… have nothing to do with the issue. It's only a matter of principle. You talk to me about principles? A man who served Hitler talking about principles! Captain, as I've already told you… I'm a soldier. You're a soldier. Please don't start talking now about… politics. This execution is necessary. It will serve to restore in this camp authority and order. Of which, you and I… both have an interest in, Captain. Now you listen to me, Bleicher. As long as it's about disinfecting, cleaning the camp, sewing buttons back, hurray for your designs! But now you want to start again with shooting… and even with our weapons… I'll be back before evening. No guns, Colonel. On this joyous occasion, the city of Emmen is truly happy, honored and proud to salute you, General Snow, the symbol and representative of all troops, of all uniforms, of all the nations who fought to return our suffering city and the world, liberty and hope and a new faith in the destiny of humanity. Forgive me, if I respond… to such a warm and generous reception… with few words. But I'm a soldier. And we soldiers, as you know, we're more used to deeds than words. I only wish to hope with you… that this most terrible of all wars, will also be the last of all wars. And that so much horror… may serve as a lesson, long-lasting and unforgotten. Thank you. Thank you, Colonel. The war has lasted so long. A horrible nightmare but it's over. Now, it's all over. Forgive me, but time is truly a ruthless tyrant. I should already be 300 kms from here. I shall always have an unforgettable memory of this ceremony. General Snow! General Sir! What? Were you in there too? I didn't see you. Where were you? - In the back. Maybe this isn't a good time, General, but I wanted to profit by the occasion to ask if I can be transferred, Sir. Transfer where? There's no front I can send you to to die like a hero. You don't like being a warden, is that it? But yours is still a war duty. You've got those damn krauts before you. While I have nothing but fat asses. I almost envy you. I've found out peace is tougher than war. Believe me, Miller, believe me. Just tell him, Laurienne, what a schedule we've got. Committee for the survey of prime necessities of liberated countries. A tour of Belgium and Holland in a week. - And in every city: delegations to be received, ceremonies, speeches. Maybe there's something wrong at your camp? No, no, General. Everything is fine. It's only that… Only that? Well, I'm not quite clear, what sort of relationship I should… I should establish from now on with… - What kind do you want to establish? They've lost the war. Don't let them forget it. And don't you either. Right - What's the problem? Sorry to have bothered you. - No bother, my boy. Too bad you're here when I'm in a rush. We'll be in touch soon. I've something to tell you. Right, Laurienne? A big surprise. Stop, one moment! What the hell's going on? Let's go! They started as soon as you left. I don't know why. I know why. Sir? - Ah, yes. Put them in there. Yes, Sir. Well? What are we gonna do? Double the sentries. Put the entire garrison on the alert. I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Sir. Grauber. What is it? You said that when… we got out of this mess… you were going to smash his face in. Right? Of course, I will! But he always has those pigs nearby. Well, I'll give you a hand. Good. I was pissed to see you drop your pants before that bunch of clowns! I know. But they scare me. Don't you worry. It happened to me too. But I'm over it. Even… Even? The women, Grauber. I'm a fool with them too. I get sentimental and… and I never do anything. Listen to your Uncle Bruno. There's a knack with women. Guide the hand to wherever the eyes go, guide near the hand… guide… Good! Everything like usual, got it? Carry on as if you were deaf. We'll end up being deaf. - What did you say? - Nothing. And if they refuse to eat today, what do we do? We'll give it to them tonight. They're well organized, taking shifts. They'll hold out for ages. We'll see who can make the most noise. Maybe I should inform HQ. I'm the one in charge here! Get that through your head! Go to the other side of the prison. Be quick. Here they come. Quick, open the gate! Give him the megaphone, Sergeant. Tell them to stop at once and get back to their barracks! Give me those guns, Captain. That's an order, Colonel! You give me those guns. Sergeant Trevor! You're making me go to my barracks, Captain? You're under arrest! Are you going in the cell on your own legs or should I have you carried in? This is a violation of the Convention… - Don't make me laugh, Colonel! I'll make a report. Good, you do that! I'll be happy to read it! Lieutenant Romney? Yes, Sir? Get every man ready at his post. Quick, under attack! Quick! Under attack! Get going! Get going! Get down! Get down! Everyone get out! Spread out! The megaphone! Stand by. Short bursts, overhead. Fire! German soldiers! You have exactly 30 seconds to clear out of the emplacement and to retire in silence to your barracks! If you refuse, we shall open fire! Fire! Go on! That's it! Fire! That's it! Fire! I warn you! If there are any further disorders… we shall fire directly at you! Sergeant? - Yes, Sir? Tomorrow morning, reveille at 6 am. - Yes, Sir. Good night. - Good night, Sir. Is the general here? - Yes, Sir. He's in your office, Sir. Has he been there long? - About 15 minutes, Sir. There you are! You might've let me know, General. I would've had somebody to meet you. At ease, Edwin. This isn't an official visit. I must be in Paris by tomorrow morning and… and I just happened to be passing by. I got here in time to see the fireworks. A magnificent show, Edwin. Casualties? - Uh, no, Sir… Purely a demonstrative action. There's been a spot of trouble here. I tried to be reasonable but… - They struck up some music. I know. I thought it wasn't necessary to inform you, Commander. It really didn't seem to me… very important. - And those two German deserters? Are you referring to them? You know about those two? Do you think I'd be where I am now if I didn't always know what was going on? What peace. You got a cigar, Edwin? I left mine in the car. No, Sir, sorry. But I've got some cigarettes here. It doesn't matter. Forget it. Is everything under control now? - Oh, yes, there's no problem now. The highest ranking officer, Colonel von Bleicher, is under arrest. Really? Listen to me, Edwin. If I got it right, you feel sorry for those two. It's understandable. But what… what we represent, the uniform, don't you think they must represent these ranks, these ribbons, our principles, our military honor? Aren't they worth… the lives of two deserters? Believe me, if a world loses respect for this… It's easy for a civilian to fill his mouth with big words. It's very easy, my boy, believe me. At the table… in peace… will contain the reasons for tomorrow's war. Yes, that is the truth. Therefore, a real soldier… mustn't ever be disbanded. We're the only guardians of the peace. Excellent. Everybody agrees in theory: democracy, liberty, equality. Human rights. Tolerance. But the problem is something else. Where do you think the true enemy is hiding? Among ourselves. The contagion of indiscipline, my son, can generate hatred for the uniform. A hatred for all uniforms. It's necessary to kill it right away. These germs are dangerous. You mustn't forget that. Then, it's only for this that we have fought, Sir? Today's enemies may become tomorrow's allies. Accompany me downstairs, I'm very late. An officer may win or lose the war, but if he loses face, he loses the respect of the men he commands. Then, it's the principle of authority that gets screwed over. Understand? If he's humiliated, it's his rank which is humiliated. And you too. And me too. It's as if we were fully insulted, humiliated with him. But excuse me, Sir, but the rules… That's your business. It's up to you to interpret them. That is, unless you pass the buck. Your father's still at the military school? - Yes, Sir. When you write home, give him my regards. I haven't seen him for a while. How is he? During my last leave, I found him to have aged a lot. He's not the man he was. Why don't you write to him about your promotion? Don't you think he would like that, Major? Let's go. The official communication is on its way. Meanwhile, if you'd like to sew another rank on your jacket, you may do so. You have my authorization. - Thank you, Sir. Canadians! Hey! Friends! Hey! You thought we were your dear friends, the Canadians, eh? Goddamn disgusting homo! I bet last night all of you shit your pants. You wanted guns and all you got was bullets. And our heroic Colonel, where was he when they started shooting? Under the barracks, eh? Sergeant! Yes? Perfect, Malley. Thank you, Sir. I hope that you appreciate this peace and quiet, Colonel. A German officer in your place… couldn't have done it any better. I suppose you mean that as a compliment? Anyway, I think it's now quite clear who commands in this camp. You! You have the weapons and are ready to use them. Major. Congratulations. I see your superiors also hold you in esteem. Well, return to your quarters. My jeep will take you. There's still a problem, Major. The jeep's waiting, Colonel. You still hafta to tell me… There's nothing I hafta tell you. I refuse to return to my lodging before I know what you've decided, Major. I too would like to know what you decided, Major, about that little problem. What about the priest, Trevor? - Not yet, Sir. If you have anything to say, do it now. I'm not a deserter! I'm not a deserter! Sign, Schultz. I don't want to die. I don't want to die! Not like this… Not like this! Your signature, Grauber. Grauber? A copy of the report for our files, Lieutenant. Drive on. Open the gate! Is this the place, Lieutenant? This is it. Get down! Get in line! Platoon, halt! Right! Left! Quick! March! The rifles are loaded and ready to use. All you have to do is lower the safety, aim and pull the trigger. Let us proceed to this execution in order to defend the state from the serious crimes these two men have committed. They have been sentenced in accordance with Article 32… of the military code. No! No! Pigs! You're all murderers! Pigs! Bastards! Murderers! Murderers! Sons of whores! Murderers! Bastards! Murderers! Fire! - Mur… Your pistol, please. Or would you prefer to give the coup de grace, Lieutenant? Get me the brigade, please. Hello? Major Miller, here. From the Emmen camp. I'd like to leave a message for General Snow, do you mind? Would you tell him that everything at the camp… is now… under control. Thank you. 5:33 on May 13th, 1945: The fifth day of peace.
