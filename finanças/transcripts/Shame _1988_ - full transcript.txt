Yeah, alright. I mean, I'll pay for it. No, no, no. I'll just tell my mum. [Asta] Thank you. (insects buzzing) (bag crumpling) Whatever possessed you to do a thing like that? God almighty, Tim.

Traveling alone, are ya? Apparently. We asked her for a beer last night, sarge, but she wouldn't be in it. You checked my oil and water, gazer? Right-o, right-o. [Tim] Miss Cadell? Yeah? On the train tonight. Great, thank you. It's gonna cost a bit though. Heh. Sorry. All fixed up then, aye? Put a bit of a hole in your holiday though, aye? Eh. What are you going to do with yourself all day? Mr. Curtis, can I borrow this bike? Sure. I suppose it'll be alright. You, if you wanna go somewhere, I'll give you a lift. No trouble. (upbeat music) Aw shit! G'day. Glad you came along. I haven't had much luck with bikes lately. (rattling) What are you going out this way? Just sort of looking 'round? Yeah, I suppose something like that. (insects buzzing) You work? Yep. Sort of an office job. Right. My wife, she works at the Meat Works. I'm a row shredder meself. No. Can't complain. Most blokes around here ain't got nothin'. Yeah. So you work at night? Yeah. Yeah, I work at night. [Asta] Must be tough on your wife. (motorcycle approaching) (honking) (rock music) G'day Butch!

(Ross groaning) He's a bloody madman. Leave him alone, go on. (groaning) We'd better get him home. Come on mate. Piss off! (insects buzzing) See, she used to go down to the club when I was workin'. You can't blame her for that much, can you? Why Penny, she likes a bit of company. A few laughs, a few drinks. Well she likes a good time. Why not? Well they give her that alright. Stupid bitch. She tries to lay charges. People say, "Charges? "Penny rights everyone, though. "What's a man supposed to do?" Blokes look at me in the street. Down at the club. Laugh. (insects buzzing) (machines whirring) God in heaven, Ross, what have you been doing? I want my wife, Dulcie. Yeah, alright, wait here. (machines whirring) Goodness me. We haven't been in the wars, haven't we, Ross? What happened? It's nothing. I'm alright. I've come to get my wife. Oh God. [Mrs. Rudolph] Penny dear, he won't say what happened. We gotta go, mum. Money. Doesn't look as though he'll be able to come to work tonight. Dulcie, Norma Curtis and Lizzie off again today? Some kind of tummy wop, I think. Looks like she'll want the day off as well. You ought to control that boy of yours, Mrs. Rudolph. Don't start all that again, Ross. You both think you can do what you like to us. I'd be careful of what I said, Ross, if I were you. You stop and listen to me, you bitch. (yelling) Andrew. Who the hell are you? (machines whirring) Dulcie? Pay those two off. Yes, Mrs. Rudolph. The rest of yous, back to work. (insects buzzing) (insects buzzing) (people chattering) [Tim] For all I know, she's been sleeping around since she had Jimmy Dickinson. Don't come near me, mate. Tina! Why don't you talk some sense in him? He seems to think you're bloody Christmas. (insects buzzing) (door slamming) (truck starting up) Yeah, that'll be right, go on, get out! Have a wink to your mates. You're pathetic! It's a bloody war crime now. Shit. (insects buzzing) How much that bod cost ya? I don't know, it was a present. I hope you're right. Now you're piss farting around the countryside? On a holiday. Mhm, seeing how the other half lives, you know. No. I don't. (insects buzzing) You're gonna fix it yourself? [Asta] Yep. Where'd you learn to do all that? A motorcycle engine is completely logical. I find it makes a nice change from people. (insects buzzing) Aye. Why'd you wanna stick your nose in all that today at the Works? Hi, Liz. [Asta] Hello. Where's dad? He went out, love. Yeah. (insects buzzing) Well? That was the boss, and he? Was her precious bloody son. (insects buzzing) You were right. He had it comin'. You see, you can just get on this fancy motorbike and piss off. You don't have to work out there. So what, so you just let them walk all over you? It's that or you don't work, smarty. Except maybe on your back. [Asta] Sounds like the same thing to me. Yeah? Oh, it's not your worry, is it? No, you can all rot for all I care. Ha! Did you really punch Andrew Rudolph? It was more of a slap actually. Can you tell me where the railway station is? [Tina] It's near my place. I'll show you. Liz, I don't... Might do you good to get out of the house, yeah, Lizzie? I suppose it'll be alright with the three of us. Fat? How could you get fat bouncing around on that bloody bike? I don't know, but I do. I wear trousers all the time in this heat. Thrush. Yeah. Then there's the crick neck and the sunburn and insects. So why do you do it? It's a lot of fun. Jeez, you wouldn't get me on one of those bikes for a million bloody bucks. (honking) Oh, Lizzie. I'm going home. (dog barking) How many of them were there? Which? Well it's not too hard to work out what happened. Yeah, well I'd just mind my own business if I were you. Okay? (dog barking) Oh, you know, Tim and me. On again, off again. His wife pissed off on him about seven years ago. He reckons he got the rough end of the stick. And did he? Yeah, I reckon. She ran off with some bloke she reckon had more get up and go. If you get the idea. And I suppose he's been hurting ever since? Right. Aw, you know how it is with men. They just need one thing, one woman, to go wrong, and then they've got an excuse. I think it's their mothers. (laughing) (honking) Yeah well anyway. (tires screeching) We'll see. Oh God. Here we go. Do you want something? Yeah, you wanna give it to us, honey? You couldn't cope with me, boy. So why don't you just piss off? - Oh geez. - Oh yes ma'am. Whatever you reckon. Just kids. You didn't know that. (insects buzzing) (train whistle blowing) Nice little place. You reckon? Yeah. It used to be my mum's 'til she died. You wanna come in and have a cuppa? You got time. The station's just over that way. Look, thanks, Tina, but I've gotta go and pick up my spare parts. I'll tell you what, I wouldn't mind a few spare parts myself. I know what you mean. Aye. Anyways, see ya. Be careful, okay? Bye. (slow piano music) (doorknob rattling) (slow, dramatic music) (dramatic music) (whistling) She's getting away, grab her! (dramatic music) (Astra breathing heavily) (dramatic music) Playing hard to get, aye? Now that your friend isn't here, you get us all to yourself. Tonight's the night, sweetheart. Bloody grab her! What are you doing, for Christ's sake? (dramatic music) (hitting) (yelling) Shit. (hitting) (yelling) (shattering) (yelling) (heavy breathing) What the hell were you doing down there anyway? What has that got to do with it? What were you doing there? Picking up a parcel, if you must know. Oh well, couldn't it have waited until the morning? No, I am a citizen. I have every right to do whatever... Do you think I've got nothing better to do than to run around these streets day and night nurse mating bloody fools like you? Now I'm a fool? We're talking about four boys. Boys. Having a bit of fun. Hey girls, what do you do for a bit of fun? Don't get smart with me, girly. Just stay off the street. They're down at the hospital. Steve Hemingway's got 15 stitches in his arm and face. I could charge you. Charge me? And when will you start on the fun loving boys? Driving under age, driving with a blood alcohol above the prescribed limit, negligent driving, conspiracy, uh, attempted abduction, assault. - Put on, ya love. - Yeah. Well, well. A bit of a bush lawyer, are we? A barrister, as a matter of fact. Yeah, well. (chuckling) Pretty funny bloody barrister. Eh? Yes. Sargent. Well you can rest assured I'll be speaking to the fathers of the boys first thing in the morning. And that's it, a little chat? No, I might have to kick a few bums as well. Alright, let's talk about you. Failure to act on a legitimate complaint, dereliction of duty... Alright miss barrister. You wanna lay charges? No. Forget it. I couldn't be bothered. (soft country music) (people chattering) (hitting) Shit. (hitting) (insects buzzing) (hitting) (insects buzzing) (insects buzzing) (birds chirping) Gas and check the lot Danny mate? Yeah, five bucks.

[Rita] Coming back to work, are ya? Having a good old gossip, are you? Talking about me? No one's talking about you, Lizzie Curtis. Oh, bullshit. Of course you're talking about her. But she's the latest. Oh, give it up Rita. Just because a few little sluts in this town get what they deserve. Don't worry sweetheart, we're going straight home. Little sluts? Is that how you explain it? You stupid bitch. Bullshit, Lizzie Curtis. I've seen at those footy club dances. You got what was coming to you. You dumb bitch, Lynn. What are you lookin' at? What? Yeah, you two. I don't even know what you're talking about. They're your sons. They're bloody animals. Don't talk to me about animals. What kind of woman is that biker friend there of yours? Roaming the streets at night and gettin' my son 15 stitches. Your son goes roaming the streets at night molesting women. What kind of a mother are you? What? What's she been saying, aye? Lizzie. Lizzie, you can't say things like that. My Bruce has never been in trouble in his life. Well he's gonna be in trouble now. And so is your little Steve! [Norma] Lizzie. You lying little tart. Slut. Lizzie! Lizzie! Will you really Liz? Really get them all? No sense in leaving any out. Then I will too. I will if you will. I'll get 'em Liz. [Norma] For God's sake, get in the car. People are gonna claim you're just making it all up. You've already left it too long. Dad, we're gonna ring the hospital. We're getting medical evidence. Oh. You leave it to someone else to be brave, Lizzie. We've gotta put all this behind us. Look, Liz. You're not Penny Ross. She's as hard as nails. Yeah, used to be. Yeah. She tried laying charges. So? So people would never talk to her in the street. She was a joke. Yeah, I remember you laughing. It didn't even get to court because, for God lovers Lizzie, you've already left... Dad. Tina? Look, I know other girls. Lots of them. They could easily be doing what I'm gonna do, but no, everyone just says, "Remember Penny Ross?" Why don't you just go and hide until the shame goes away? And nothing ever happens. Well mum. I've ironed your dress, love. [Boy] Aye. Here they come. (boys chattering and catcalling) Now what do we do? Nothin'. We stay calm. Andy? You go come. You too, mate. But nobody does a disappearing act, right? Let's let the Sargent play. Policemen will play along. Now everybody knows what to say? (all agreeing) We're gonna need that lawyer again. It's alright, mate. We'll get him. Won't we, Andy? Yeah. Dad. Don't come in. There's things I have to say that I don't, I don't want you... (slow piano music) (door closing) (slow piano music) I said that I would. You put a dress on. Maybe I should have got changed too. I thought you weren't comin’, Liz. (car approaching) Lorna. Look, for God's sake. Yeah. (slow piano music) (car starting up) (slow piano music) The football season's starting. We have a Jim Cana soon. I mean, there's a whole town here. Something like this could turn neighbors, households against each other. I imagine your business could suffer, Mr. Curtis. It might. Naturally I feel responsible, and just because it's my own son apparently involved. Of course. Are you here on the capacity of the Curtis' legal advisor, Miss Cadell? Oh, I don't know. Tim, do you want me to go? Uh, no. You stay. Please. Yes, well, I had hoped, Mr. Curtis, that you and I might have discussed this one parent to another. However, you see, these charges. Isn't there some way we can resolve this amongst ourselves? If Lizzie really feels she was wronged. She was wronged, Mrs. Rudolph. Oh dear. I'm so sorry, Lizzie darling. But revenge is... What? Well these things happen. Oh, I don't want to seem unreasonable, but, how about a holiday, darling? Or some lovely new clothes. Don't you want want a holiday, Liz? Singapore, Disneyland? Anywhere you want? Hm? Lovely new clothes? How much are you offering in cash, Mrs, Rudolph? I didn't have a precise figure in mind. But you are prepared to be very generous? Of course. Picking up a little business while you're here, Miss Cadell? Well let me make one thing very clear. My family is not going to be dragged through the mud because of some little factory girl. Well I think you've made yourself perfectly clear. (door slamming) Well that's a taunt. I'll be right with ya, sarge. Don't go without me. You're just gonna take the girls word for it, are you, Wal? Al little bit she hops and you jump, aye? It's my job, gentlemen. The girl laid charges. Serious charges. Now come on Robert. Move. He's a working man, you know, Wal. Out of working, working man. What's the bail? Bail? You all know that's not up to me. Hey fellas. Reckon we'd better have a whip around and start a fighting fund. (laughing) Not a bad idea, gezzer. Nice one, gezzer. Alright, take them down and get on with it. Don't worry about a thing, Danny boy. We'll see you right. Dale Owens. Six she reckons. Ought to be grateful. Catch ya's later. Just because a few lads act like nature intended. She reckons six. Maybe she's just skating. (laughing) Any more for the fighting fund? Come on you blokes. [Man] Now here's the man we want to see. Oh God. Now you lot settle down. G'day. Wal. Listen, I, I wouldn't come in here if I was you. Probably, Wal. Look, I believe your girl's story, alright? I believe her, and I'm real sorry. But you coming down here? What's that gonna prove? I just want a beer. I haven't had one for 20 years. (soft country music) Yeah, what is this Tim? What's going on? I don't Earl, suppose you tell me. Now don't be a smart ass, Tim boy. Didn't you see the coppers? Had my son and those other blokes under arrest. Give us a glass, please, Beth. Nothing new on that call. Your boy's been arrested before. Bloody hell, Tim, this is serious. You're right, it is. Now come on Tim. No hard feelings. Man to man, old son. Your girl, what's her name? Lizzie. Watch what you say, Phil. Aye, you're dozy, Tim boy. You're the last to know. Caught her coming home this time, did ya? Yeah my little Steve, he's a good boy. He hasn't been in any trouble before. Your good boy, eh? Your good boy probably held my Lizzie down. All those other good boys... Doesn't need any holding down from what I hear. (grunting) (hitting) (yelling) (yelling) (yelling) (hitting) Alright, gentlemen, right-o. You two, outside. The rest of ya, be your age and settle down. Right? (heavy breathing) Happy? You do your drinking alone for a bit, aye? I didn't come here looking for trouble. Get your girl to drop it, Tim. (slow piano music) (spitting) (laughing) Anyway. "Where is me dinner?" he says. "I'm tired, ” I say. "You'll just have to get your own." Well you should have seen him. "Not enough a man's got to ask you for me drinking money, ” he says, "and can't even get his dinner." Hasn't he heard of women's liberate? You're a career woman, love. - Oh yeah that'd be right. So then he says, he says, "If you won't get me me dinner, "I ain't gonna rooch us no more "and I'll find myself a real woman." Go on, he'd never. Blood oath, he did. So what'd you do, Rita? Got him his dinner. (laughing) [Tina] Oh yeah, what can you do? Well, I wasn't gonna miss out. I've been thinking about it all day. Oh Rita. Oh look at little miss sweet. Go on, you like a bit when it's nice, don't ya? Well it's nice. (chuckling) (birds chirping) What happened, dad? Nothing. (women laughing) Why don't you get a hold of that detective bloke. Alright. Let's take 'em down. You know. Dad. (honking) Should I get that? No. Yeah, would you? Please, love. (women laughing) That was Betty on the phone down at the pub. She reckons all the boys will be back on the streets within the hour. Oh yeah. Seems Mrs. Bloody Rudolph's gone on bond. And get this? The blokes at the pub passed a hat around. A big joke. (laughing) (slow, dramatic music) (people cheering) (slow, dramatic music) The justice of the peace has been apprised of the facts and bail has been approved and posted. I want an injunction restraining any of these men from coming anywhere near the Curtis house and specifically, Miss Curtis herself. Oh do ya? Well that's coming on a bit strong, isn't it? I mean. Jesus, how far is she gonna take this? This time you're going to jail. Did you hear that? Did you hear what she said? Yeah, I heard. Our blokes are gonna run rings around her, aye? She's done this before mate. You can tell. - She just sounds good. Right, she's got you scared, has she? Oh, Wayne's just pissed his pants. (laughing) Come on, let's go to the pub. Might be best to get out of town for a bit. Yeah, until things quiet down. She can go to your sister down in Esperance. Sure, they'd love that. That's really admitting they've got you scared. You should be scared. Give her a break, Asta. Why? Do you think they're gonna give her a break out there? Do you wanna hear some pretty stories about women who have laid charges? Well anyway, I'm not scared. Well not with you around. But what about you, Lizzie? What about you sticking up for yourself? I can. Can you? What if there's no one? I think you'd just freeze up. No, I wouldn't.. Oh you'll be ready, aye? Hey, Lizzie. - Stop It. Pretty little Lizzie. You should cut it out, Asta. Stop It. No. Stop it! You can't count on anyone Lizzie. Come on, fight back! - No, stop it! Alright. You can't count on anyone, Lizzie. (slapping) Yeah, at least like that. (slow piano music) And smile. He thinks he's got you, right? Lift your knee up right into his balls, do you understand? That's gonna hurt him badly. And your hands, Lizzie. These little hands. You can do a lot with them. Dig in here, in the windpipe, and just pull hard. Alright? Or else just go for the eyes. Just go for the eyes. - The eyes? - You heard me. I didn't bring her up for this. Do you think I like it? Do you think I like watching every shadow and jumping at every sound? (slow piano music) Alright. Now, he's got you. He's got you like this, alright? Oh, Asta. Asta. What if there's six? I don't know, Lizzie. (country music) (honking) Hi Melina. Here we are. Well, we going in? We are. You's fellas can do what you like. (car approaching) Get us some more beer, rich boy. You don't have to... Alright. And some smokes! Hi Danny. Me and Rachel aren't doing anything tonight. (boys laughing) Yeah? (country music) Well. What a night, aye? Saturday night. Aye. Cheer up, little Stevie, mate. Now listen, it'll be the children's call for you anyways, so forget it. G'day, Danny mate. Cradle snatching tonight, aye? (laughing) [Wayne] Piss off. Aye, Susan.

I used to wear that scent when I was about 18. I was wearing it when I told his father. Oh. (insects buzzing) Funny to think people have been walking on her up there, aye? God, I'd love to do that. [Lizzie] Gran. (chuckling) Yeah. Walking on the moon. I have dreams about it. (insects buzzing) (men chattering) Where'd you go, mate?

I see where Lizzie gets it from. Yeah, she was a real tiger, aye? Shut up, shut up! Ah shit, she bit me! (horn honking) (men yelling) (men yelling) (Norma screaming) Bridge. The railway bridge.
