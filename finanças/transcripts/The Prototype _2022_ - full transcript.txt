The prototype has been located. Water. I don't feel so good. Considering you've been buried for over 300 years, you look pretty good to me. What? What the hell are you talking about? Do I know you? You look kind of familiar. You can call me Tony. I'm a human clone of one of your dead colleagues at the agency. You can't remember a thing, can you? No, am I supposed to? Don't worry, we're on the same team. We're the good guys. Your name is Garrett Brown. Your the last human survivor of the nuclear war. Everything, everybody you knew, is gone. What the hell are you talking about, man? I don't believe anything you're saying. What the... - Where the hell am I? - Calm down. Look around. The world you knew is gone. Your life has been preserved until just the right moment. And this is it. But you have less than one day of life in you. You have survived all this time because you drank one of these. I've just given you an additional injection. It'll help you remember. Trust me, we can't move forward if you don't remember what happened. Why in the hell should I trust you? You're dying. You better believe that. I'm dying? What the hell did you inject me with? It's an alien supplement. I understand you had it before. Now concentrate. We do not have much time. Hopefully, it will help you remember. Hopefully. Hope. Reverend Hope. The case. We've become skeptical evangelists full of fire and brimstone. Who come on television to ask us for money. I am not going to do that. We've been criticized for using our followers' donations to fund many successful businesses. I felt we should use the money responsibly, support ourselves. We have followers who are poor and it is difficult for them to give. I am happy to announce today that the Jeremiah C. Hope Ministries, will no longer be accepting donations. We'll be the first of our kind to operate without taking another penny from anyone. The United States government pegged him as another false messiah. They feared he would become the most dangerous man in the world. Worse than Jim Jones, David Koresh, even worse than Mercury Mason, the deadliest of all the false prophets. He was responsible for the suicide deaths of 5,000 men, women and children in August 2003. Jeremiah Hope, a simple country boy from Georgia, who's pledged his life to God's service. They weren't about to let it happen again. Sci-Tech, a special investigation agency, was created. The best of the FBI, CIA and other special agencies throughout the free world. This time it was a different case, a new enigma. It was about one man and one man alone. Reverend Jeremiah C. Hope. Good, you're starting to recover. Maybe, but I still feel like crap. That's normal after all this time, you'll be yourself in no time, okay? What do you mean, "No time?" One day, two days? What? Unfortunately, yes. Shit. We got company. Stay down. That'll buy us some time. Come on, we got to go. - Where to? - That was our ride. We've got to find a place to hide. Let's go. - Cigarette? - No thanks. Last smoke on Earth. So, where are you taking me? Home. Home? To what's left of the agency. Years ago, we built a subterranean secret facility to protect us from the radiation. Although the humans died we got our hands on some alien technology and we managed to clone ourselves. Only the fittest and the strongest made it. What else do you remember? I don't know, man. I'm too tired. Listen to me. This is extremely important. Look, come on man. I don't know if you're real or not. Seriously, tell me what is going on here. Look, I have nothing to hide, okay? I'm here to help you. Help me? Okay. Who buried me? Virgil Conway did. He wanted to preserve your life. He's also my creator. Do you remember him? Can't say I do. He's already dead. So why did you come for me? You'll find out later, I promise. Great. Who was that that just attacked us? Alien terrorists from the planet Nobus. Nobus? You're very creative, Tony. As I told you, I'm here to help you. Now, what else do you remember about this? SciTech agency log. Monday, 17 April, 1998. Investigate the rising of Reverend Jeremiah C. Hope. Mysterious disappearances at Hope's discovery camps. Money ties with Future Corp and CEO Stew Horn. That was brutal. I love getting yelled at for an hour straight, don't you? Yeah. Well, what do you expect? I mean, they've been trying to keep this thing out of the media forever. Well, with the shit that went down with Mercury Mason, I can't say that I blame them. Shit man. Reverend Hope is going to be on the cover of every major magazine and every television show tomorrow. If the stress is too much, maybe you should consider other work. The weak don't survive in this business. Who you calling weak? It was just a general statement. It was not directed at anyone in particular. Come on. Let it go. He's just pushing your buttons. Good idea. Considering I'm the lead agent in this investigation. You don't have to constantly remind us. With this, we have plenty to start turning up the heat on Reverend Hope. Why the delays? Our execution has to be flawless. Our plan, perfect. Come on. The whole world knows this guy. We've got to start pressuring him now. We will not be reckless just because we under scrutiny. More bullshit. I had a meeting with the contact that gave me the pictures. Virgil Conway. All right. You finally found out his name, huh? I had to go to Italy to find the guy. Pictures, too. Who's the woman? His girlfriend. Her name is Rosa. She's an exchange student at a local university. Her family's in Italy. What, you only have two pictures of her? It was windy. I kept waiting for her dress to fly up so I could take more. - Never happened. - The voice of a real pro. - She's not involved. - Alright. This afternoon, I'm meeting with a programmer from Future Corp that got fired last week. Virgil's to contact me tomorrow. Good. Well, I'll be with the fun and exciting boys from electronic reconnaissance all day tomorrow. Why don't you meet me at my place in, uh, 42 hours. - All right? - All right. - Hey. - What? I've been investigating something else lately. What's that? You're sleeping with Jenna. All right, I'll catch you later. Goddamn, can you say, "Obsessed?" Helps keep me focused. Well, at least you don't have a picture - of him in a bathing suit. - Oh, but I do. Keep it hidden under my mattress. - Come on, show me what you got. - All right. Virgil gave me this. This links Future Corp to the Hope Ministries and number one to both of them. It's not enough. We need to catch him in the act. I thought you might say that. He told me someone from Future Corp is going to deliver a package to Number One tomorrow night. Well, that package better be damn important. We've got to convince Hines to let us go after his number one agent. How about two million in cash? That's it. Stew Herns from Future Corp. He's been transferring funds to offshore accounts for, what, six months now? And I'll bet you it's close to two million bucks. And it's a match. Why don't we just take the money and go to Aruba? - I'd spend it in six months. - Yeah, I believe that. Sure you wanna do this? Yeah. All right. We'll take this to Hines in the morning. Go home and get some sleep. You've got balls. Are you sure that you can prove this? - Absolutely. - Enough to risk your own career? Yes, sir. I'm giving you the green light. Don't mess this up. No turning back now. Wouldn't have it any other way. You're a traitor to the agency. Don't make this any more difficult. Jesus. Jenna. Jenna, wake up. Come on, wake up. What happened? Number One was here. He killed everybody. No, no, no, no, no. That's impossible. I just killed him. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Hey, hey, shh. Hey, hey. It's all right. It's all right. It's going to be okay. I promise. Do you still love me? Hey. Of course I do. That belongs to me. What the hell? - Who are you? - A good friend. - Now give me back the case. - No. This belongs to the agency. Get back. I said step back! - He's back! - Who the fuck are you? What the fuck do you want? This is what it's all about, isn't it? This is what gives you your power. Don't be a fool. That won't work. Maybe not. But I'll take that risk. I thought you were our best agent. I am, and I always finish the job. This is what it's all about. Information. That's the key to real power. Please! No, no, no! Mission accomplished. Proceed. Who's my next brain? A very important leader. You'll be surprised. Why am I being interrogated? I've got five dead bodies to account for. One of them being the agency director. The secretary of Defense is breathing down my back and you're... the only survivor. - You think I did it? - I ask the questions here. You answer them. That's how it works. Understood. Now, someone dropped the package off in the trunk of your car last night. Who and what? He's a contact I have in the Hope Ministries. It was blueprints for his next camp. You went to see Stew Hern last night. - Why? - I never heard of him. What were you doing in the parking garage? - My garage? - The one in the apartment building on Martel Street. - An agent saw you there. - I've never been there. So you think the agent's lying? Maybe he thought he saw me, but he was mistaken. How did you know Number Three was dead? I wasn't aware of his death. Is that right? For your information, his body was found on a park bench this morning by the police in West Hollywood. How unfortunate. But you're sure Number Two is dead. I saw his body! Who's Virgil Conway? The name doesn't sound familiar. You know him. You reacted when I mentioned his name, you weren't expecting it. I don't know a Virgil. You just don't know anything. Do you? No. I have something I think is going to help jar your memory. Apparently, I was wrong. Apparently so, now sit down. Wake up Number Two. I said, wake up Number Two. I think there's somebody here you're really going to be surprised to see. Stop! Now why is it you two have completely different versions about what went on last night? All I know is he killed them all. Funny, he seems to think you did. No way. Guy's a fricking freak. I shot him over and over again and he didn't die. He killed them all. Number three and Jenna were having an affair, you killed him in a jealous rage. - No! - I know people that would kill their own mother for $2 million. There was never any money in the briefcase when I picked it up. - Money wasn't there. - Bullshit! You have a clear motive. We have you on camera entering the building. Now listen to me. He killed them all. He killed Clay, and he went to the agency and he killed the rest of them. I wasn't in the building. I couldn't have done it. I can prove he's been sabotaging our investigation - of Reverend Hope. - You're desperate. All that money and nowhere to go. Who are those two men you met with yesterday from Future Corp? I don't know anyone from that company. What about the pictures and the documents I gave you? Number One has given me an acceptable explanation for all of it. I have more, Hines. I have enough to put this guy away. Produce the evidence. It was at my safe house. And I'm sure you took it after you thought I was dead. But you have nothing to back you up, Number Two. Christ. Can't you see he set me up, Hines? Well, if he did, he did a pretty goddamn good job of it. You were dead when we found you, and now you're alive. - How? - I don't know. "I don't know..." Excuse me, gentlemen. You're absolutely certain it was Number One you saw driving into the apartment on Martel? Positive. Take him out. What are you? The liquid you drank should have killed you. - How did you survive? - I don't... I don't know. - You feel different? Stronger? - Yeah. Just like King fucking Kong! This presents an interesting problem. You must come with me. I won't hurt you. Yeah, right. Are you kidding me? Is that your best shot? The solution worked on you, but not on the others. What others? I'm the only person that can help you. Help me? You wanted to kill me. The liquid you drank may kill you. I may be able to save your life. Why save me? Last night you wanted me dead. Come with me and I will tell you. You can't kill me. You were so sure of yourself last night. The way you toyed with me. But now you're afraid of me. I'm not afraid of you. I want you alive. Yeah? Then come and get me. I will. Not now, but I will. That's it. After that, my mind draws a blank. You will get it back. Patience. Now we got to keep going. An old friend awaits us. Hold on to this. Cover your eyes. Hines. His clone actually. Sorry to have ordered your execution, it was in the interest of national security. Yeah, well, it looks like we all screwed that one up real good, didn't we? As long as you are still alive, there is half a chance. How is his memory now? Much better, but he's not ready yet. Ready for what? You must recover as much information as possible in order to activate Virgil's message. - What message? - We don't know. We were programmed to bring you in once the radiation levels had dropped. Computer is ready, sir. Take a seat, Garrett. So why me, Hines? You were exposed to chemical warfare in the Persian Gulf. Your DNA mutated with the alien supplement, providing you superior strength. But as you found out, plenty of side effects and certain death. - I see. - You were just lucky to last a little bit longer than the rest of the humans. I have computer sync up, sir. Take us back into your memories, Garett. The more you can remember, the more accurate Virgil's message will be. Tell us about Virgil Conway. You're one unique man. You'd think I'd come out here to paint the lake, or the hills? What are you going to call it? "Nobus At Peace." Nobus? Just a place I made up. A place in that wild imagination of yours. I love it, Virgil. You've been criticized for using charitable donations to build a corporate empire. Why do you need all that money? I have never benefited personally from the money. Money was going to various charities. Also, my discovery camps. Discovery camps? Cities you will build, places free from crime and hate. We will invite people of all races, rich and poor alike as brothers and sisters. We hope those that do not follow God will come to our camps and discover him. Those that have the faith will be able to learn more. Situations like these always end in tragedy. Jim Jones, Mercury Mason. I understand the criticism. These camps will not be isolated like Mercury Mason's. The people will be free to come and go as they please. I believe in trusting the people on this Earth. I believe in their good nature. The people will govern themselves. What are your ties with Future Corp? I have none. I have no need for computers. I was told you have an announcement you would like to make. Unfortunately, I have grave news. Five days from now, Southern California is going to be devastated by an earthquake. I believe it will be at least an eight on the Ric... You knew you couldn't hide forever. How did you find me? Persistence. Along with your sloppiness. Actually, we stopped looking until you became an informant for the United States government. Hey! The miracle will burn! Who are you? You're welcome. Why did you save me? - Did you set us up? - Who? You're Clay's contact, right? Ah, your Clay's partner. I was. He's dead. I'm sorry. Stay there. I drank one of these puppies, it nearly killed me. - Are you sure you drank this? - Yeah. How did you get a hold of it? Came across it while investigating another agent. I see. Help me here. Sorry about that. What the hell did you do that for? I had to see if you were telling the truth. The blue liquid you drank is a diet supplement. It's supposed to help humans improve their skills. So you shoot me in the chest? It hurts less than a gut shot. Yeah, well, don't ever do anything like that again. So, how's this supplement supposed to improve my skills? And by the way, where the hell do you come from? I come from the planet Nobus. Great, another fucking alien. So which one are you? E.T. or The Terminator? Neither. Morrucan. All right, moving on. You don't sound too surprised. With all the shit I've seen in the last 48 hours, I believe just about anything. Well, there's more. The supplement will increase your strength tenfold. Unfortunately, I don't know its side effects. They've been testing it on humans. No survivors. We need it in order to adapt to this planet's atmosphere. A sip and we feel rejuvenated. So why test it on a human? I can't explain it all now. Piak, Number One to you, is going to start wondering why they haven't reported back yet. Time to explore. This is amazing. Is there any information here we can use? We? I'll have to look at this later. All right, fine. So what is Reverend Hope's part in all of this? He's a human puppet controlled by the alien boss. Alien boss? Yes. Allatarek. He's been their leader ever since he arrived on my planet. Wait a minute. You're telling me that he's an alien to you also? He tried to control our planet just like he's trying to take over yours. What? He's trying to conquer Earth? Not completely. He just wants to use you. He wants Earth's raw materials and its manufacturing infrastructure to build ships and weapons. He wants your population as soldiers. He plans on going back to Nobus and continuing his war. Number One, Piak, works for him. He was the most dangerous terrorist on Nobus. His group had killed thousands of people. One day this Allatarek appeared and Piak allied with him. It's pretty bizarre you'd have terrorism on a planet that's so advanced like yours. Just because technology improves, doesn't mean people improve along with it. True. So, does this Allatarek control Piak? He, convinced Piak he was sent to him from there, God, Allalak. He gained his trust. Help me get these guys to the truck. Is it over yet? Are they dead? In order to kill them, you must first erase their brains, then cremate them. So how did you stop Allatarek? I infiltrated their group and given away their position. We bombed them and destroyed most of their facilities. He realized he couldn't win, but he still wanted a piece of Nobus. An island the size of your Africa the long part of the planet. He would use it to rebuild. He planned on attacking our Temple of Thoughts. He wanted the community of minds. Thoughts we've saved of our great scientists, creative geniuses. Great minds that guide us. So how in the hell did you get here? Oh, yeah, the good stuff. I informed my people of their location. They bombed again, this time with more powerful weapons. They destroyed everything. The terrorists also discovered me, but didn't kill me. They took me with them to the spaceship for ransom. Our navy was patrolling the area and was on them the minute they took off. Cruisers pounded them. Damaged and desperate, they headed out to space. The Navy was closing in. There was a dark matter fold into space. Every probe we send through there was destroyed. No one would even try to take a ship through. Piak and this Allatarek had no choice. We went through then suddenly we're shot out at incredible speed. I was in restraints. We were thrown about the ship and knocked unconscious. The computer system managed to crash land the ship on Earth in a secure place south of your continent. They put me in a gas chamber and ejected me into the ocean. The machine didn't work. I was lucky. I survived. Will you help me? I protected my world, it's not my job to protect yours. I lost everything I had fighting them, not this time. Why not? You can't go back to the other aliens. You can't live amongst us because we'll all be slaves. You have no place to go. They cannot control every piece of land on this planet. I know of safe spots that'll be left alone. It'll be a simple life. But we'll be free. Who's we? You and Rosa? How do you know about her? I have my sources. After I fled the agency, I tracked you down, did my homework and saved your life. - You think I owe you. - Yeah. I didn't ask you to save me. I don't owe you anything. I'll give you what I have on them. You'll have to save your world. Not me. Great. So, you're just going to let us rot in slavery. Your people are going to have to defend themselves like we did. But someone like you could give us the chance we need to survive. - You can't stop him. - But you did. There's nothing I can do now. Nothing you can do or will do? All right, then there's nothing I will do. You can waste your time with me, or you can spend it trying to stop them. That's bullshit. Once they're done with us here, they'll return to Nobus and finish what they started. You'd be best off going to a safe area. Take your family with you. It's your only chance. Give me the keys to your car. I'll give you a ride in the city. That's all you're getting. So is it official? The rumors are expected to become official in minutes. If it is confirmed, we are witnessing the first major assassination of the new millennium. It is a great loss for mankind. It is a terrible moment. Is there any word yet on who is responsible? They say it's the work of one man, someone unknown to the Vatican's inner circle or to the Pope's group of advisers. Apparently he disappeared mysteriously. Virgil? Virgil? Virgil? Virgil? Virgil's fine but he won't be back for a while. Who are you? It's all right, I'm not here to hurt you. - I'm a government agent. - Get out of my house, okay? I have something very important to show you, please! Please, it's very important. Wait. It's about Virgil. - What do you want from Virgil? - He's in serious trouble. We're all in serious trouble. You need to watch this. Please. Not completely. He just wants to use you. He wants Earth's raw materials and its manufacturing infrastructure to build ships and weapons. He wants your population as soldiers. This is fake, okay? I couldn't fake this. If so, why is this truck here? Where's Virgil? This is my ID card. Contact SciTech, they'll confirm everything with you. I don't trust you. Okay? This is fake. Get off my property. Now! You didn't need to involve her! You gave me no choice! I should erase your thoughts and replace them with those of a cockroach. Virgil, listen, if they can find you, they can find her. - You're not an alien! - Come on, Virgil, it can't be! - I'm sorry, I love you. - You are sorry? You are sorry? You love me? Please, Rosa. I can explain. I love you. Virgil, get away from me! Rosa. Rosa, you could be in danger! Shit! You don't understand. She's all I have in this world. Give me back my car keys. I can't do that. She'll be fine as long as we work together, and the sooner we act, the better it is for everybody. I should kill you. In order for you to help Rosa, you have to help me. I can find Rosa on my own. True. What if Piak finds her first somehow? You wouldn't give them that kind of advantage. But that's exactly what you're doing by not helping me. Mind your temper, remember, we're equals. All I have to do is get away from you. Filthy earthling. I hope you're the first slave. Maybe Rosa will be. Sorry, I didn't want to have to do things this way, but you left me no choice. I'll help you for now, but I'm telling you will fail. What? Did they teach you that in the Morrucan Army? Okay, let's check the computer one more time. - What is it? - It's a message. For us. From Piak. - He has Rosa. - No way. He also assassinated the Pope. Hello, gentlemen. You can't kill me, remember? I wouldn't bet on that if I were you. Save it for later. I need a favor from you. - Where's Rosa? - Relax, Morrucan. She's fine. I think she's enjoying her connection to the computer. You bastard. Wait a minute. Let him finish. Good. Now, listen carefully. Two days from now, Reverend Hope will be in New York. He'll be staying at the Plaza Hotel. He'll be in his room between five and six o'clock, accompanied by only five human bodyguards. At exactly 5:37, you will shoot him in the chest. You'll make sure he dies. 5:37. Not a minute before, not a minute after. You fail, Rosa becomes my personal slave. Sooner or later, Piak. I can't wait. Goodbye for now, gentlemen. Why in the hell is he betraying Allatarek? I believe it's because of you. - Garrett. - God bless you. Now, that wasn't that hard, was it? Remembering the past is the easy part. Accepting the fact that everyone's gone? I don't think I'm prepared for this. Don't blame yourself. Nobody saw it coming. Reverend Hope and Piak worked hard to find a human that would survive the DNA experiments. They made a big mistake letting you go. They never saw your potential. All these centuries, Piak has been heavily patrolling this planet, looking for you or waiting for us to bring you in. We have been protecting you for all this time. Earth was heavily contaminated, so we had to wait. How in the hell did we let this happen? There's no time for regrets. If Piak captures you, he will clone you and create an invincible army. So what now? Over here, your palm will activate the message. Welcome back, Garrett. I'm glad you're still in one piece. These have been some tough years. You were right. I should have cared much earlier about your planet. I am sorry I couldn't stop the war on time. You have suffered a great memory loss due to the alien supplement you drank. When your body couldn't resist it much longer and your death was inevitable, I decided to preserve your life and await your resurrection. The community of agreed that we should give humanity a second chance, and they have planned something special for you. Not far from here, there is a hidden city. Inside the city, there is a palace. Your destiny awaits you there. Good luck to you, old friend. I am transmitting the location now. I got it. I know the way. Excellent. We must be on the way then. Well, well, well. Just like a class reunion. SciTech Agents united. Piak. I should have killed you myself. No, sir, I'm going to kill you this time. I got him, sir. I killed you once, and I'll kill you again, and I'll kill your clones and the clones of your clones as I please. This is my planet now, and I will rule it without any interference. I'm your interference now. What the hell were you thinking when you destroyed the entire planet? Come here and I'll kill you with my bare hands. Don't get emotional on me now. Just make it easy for everybody. Just surrender. - Not likely. - Look at you now, old man. I've waited a long time to find you. Well, I'm not going anywhere without a fight. Get out of here, boys. I'll handle these puppets myself. Are you okay? I think so, but I'm feeling kind of weird again. This is the last supplement we have left. Blue liquid. Gotta love this stuff. You're welcome. You think Piak's dead? He's getting stronger every minute. We can't take any chances. Well, in that case, follow me. I know where the hidden palace is. - There. - There's nothing there. Can't you see it? It's right there. Come on. - You see it now? - No. You got a gun? Un-fucking-believable. - Let's go. - Let's go. Welcome. We've been expecting you. And you are? I am Queen Ilona. And you are my guest. Queen of who exactly? My planet was devastated like yours by Piak and his army. The community of mines have brought us here to rebuild our society. So why am I here? You are the reason this palace exists. You are the one who will save mankind. I don't recall applying for that job. A gift was given to you. Your survival will give the human race a second chance. I don't quite understand. You will. We're running out of time. Ladies, please escort our guest to his room. Make sure he gets ready for the ceremony. Ceremony? This might sound strange, but a ceremony must take place in order for the community of mines to send you back in time. Back in time? Yes, you will be travelling soon. Now, let's get the ceremony started. When the light comes, you must plunge this dagger into your heart. Yeah, right. That sounds like a great plan. Your sacrifice will save your world. Look, Queen. I'm sorry, I don't mean to rain on your parade, but I've been buried a few hundred years, I haven't got my memory back yet. And you expect me to commit suicide, travel back through time so I can save the human race? - Exactly. - And if I don't? There is not much life left in you. It is the only way to save your planet and change this dark future. My queen, the army has surrounded the temple. The shield won't resist much longer. Let's do something! We are not warriors, we have no weapons. Great, you're going to get slaughtered. Why don't I just turn myself over? No, you can't do that. You must fulfill your destiny. We must get the ceremony started. I'd rather just fight them. Stay down. Get down. Glad you could join the party. Who's the lady? Queen Ilona, meet your savior, Tony. Thank you for your help. Once this is over, you will be rewarded. - Thanks. - Not bad for a clone. - Is there another way out? - No. Yes, there is. Let's give 'em some hell. - Stay here. - Ready? Piak! No. Ilona? The light... it's coming for us all. Erase his thoughts. Interesting. You're next. Did you have a nice nap? Get enough rest? Oh, and by the way, sorry about your planet. Just taking care of business. Terrorism business? Slaughtering millions of people? Destroying an entire planet? You're going to pay big time for it, Piak. You're the last survivor of a weak race, you have nowhere to run now. Who's running? Your time's up. And what makes you think you can beat me? You're one small alien on the wrong planet at the wrong time. I'll make you a deal. You give me your DNA sequence and I'll let you live. I'll even spare a few of these women. You can start a family. Nice offer. But I've got a better plan. How about we travel back through time and you die in the process? So many years and you haven't lost that sense of humor. Remember, you can't kill me. I am what you humans call "immortal." And you... you were the prototype of a new breed, a new race that will make my army stronger. You humans, the missing link in my quest. Well, keep dreaming, Piak. I gave you a chance. Show time. Good morning. Where are we? I found you outside the house last night naked and you had a wound to your chest. Don't you remember? And who are you and what are you doing on my claim? I'm sorry, I can't remember. Um... I'm a little confused. Where are we exactly? Tombstone, Arizona Territory. Seriously? Of all the places, I get stuck in a tourist trap. We don't get many tourists around here. Just prospectors... like my late husband, and thirsty cowboys. - What year is it? - 1880. Look, um... I want to thank you for your hospitality, but I got to get out of here. I got to go. Go where? I got to go to the authorities to figure all this out. Perhaps Sheriff Clark can help you? If you're going to do that, you'll need better clothing. Yes, please. I think you're about the same size as my late husband. Here, take these. All right. Thank you for your hospitality. What... What's your name? - Carol. - Carol. I'm Garrett. Nice to meet you. Pleasure to meet you and thank you very much, but I got to get going. Sheriff. Sheriff. You ain't from around here. Funny you should say that, because I'm definitely not from around here. Well, where are you coming from? I can't really say, but I need to confirm that you are who you say you are and that we are where you believe we are. I don't follow you there. You better start talking, who are you? Okay. I am from the future. Your future. But something happened and I wasn't supposed to end up here. But where are you supposed to be? That's not important. My name is Garrett Brown. I'm a special agent for the U.S. government, and I need to speak to the president as soon as possible. We don't go for that crazy talk around here. I think you're going to need to stay here until we figure out who you are. Lock him up, boys. El diablo! El diablo! Don't know how the hell that happened. Haul him back to the jail, lock him up. You boys clear out. I need to talk to this man alone. It's just me and you in here. You tell me your story and I'll listen. Sure you're ready? It's a hell of a ride. That is one hell of a story. - I believe you. - You do. I do, Garrett. I got a telegram. Sky man, like you, showed up in Las Cruces, New Mexico a couple of days ago and killed a few men. According to this, he's heading this way. Can't be him, can it? You mean that Pee-yak? - Piak. - Piak. The alien conqueror from your story? If your story's true, and I assume it is, we better be ready for him. I agree. Whiskey. - You look good. - So do you. I think. Didn't I just kill you? Gentlemen, my friend here thinks I can be killed. A mistake he made more than once. You will find this information amusing. There was a glitch in the system. A virus was unleashed into your population, followed by a deadly pandemic, and as you can imagine, the community of minds wanted to preserve your life once again, but gave you no warning. So here we are. Both of us stuck in the past with no army, no purpose and no blue liquid. What a shame. Well, maybe my DNA could be a cure. Too many maybes. Sheriff? You have exactly one minute to go outside and release your prisoner to me. If you fail to comply, I will have every gun for hire in this dust bowl shoot anyone who opposes. That includes women and children. Ask him, I'm good for that. Listen up, cowboys, I will pay $1,000 dollars to whoever brings me Diablo. Dead or alive. - Who wants to play? - I do! I do! Whatever happens, he cannot capture me. Burn my body if necessary. - He wants your DNA? - Correct. What the hell's DNA? Let him out. It's been a pleasure to know you. Let's give them some hell. This is my army? You're not going to capture me. I've got something better than the blue liquid if you want to stick around a little longer. This is your ticket home. Reload, I'll give you a chance. You know bullets can't kill... You want to go back to the future and I'll risk everything to kill you. You want my DNA, asshole?
