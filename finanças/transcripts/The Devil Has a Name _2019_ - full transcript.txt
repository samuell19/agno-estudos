Been doin' some readin' sugar plum. My boy got ahold of your private electronic correspondence. Mm, slanderous stuff. All pointin' fingers and wild accusations. The last confined gasps of a little girl who could not cope with failure, with ruination. Consider this your invitation to the death march of Gigi Cutler, Queen of California. Houston City, Wednesday week. We'll provide the golden parachute. All you've gotta do is jump. Between you and me, I'm just plain tickled to see it. Bye bye now. Is that Gigi Cutler? Yep. - Lookie here. - Who do we have? Just walked up,. Shore Oil and Gas, how can I help you? Oh. Lookie here at this piece of shit like you. Gigi, lovin' the tie. He had to tie it on in Texas. Aw, honey you got some smut, you got a little spunk there on you. Consider yourself lucky it's just tuna. Folks around here get fiery. Not 300 miles away is where what's his face got shot in the melon. Who is that? JFK. Culled like a veal calf for his premature ambitions. I'll say this much for LBJ, that swingin' dick could not abide whipper snappers. Now you've been gunnin' after my gig, Gigi. You mighta had it, too. Risin' star, young blood, lady parts. Whipper snapper. Lucky then the board's gonna save me the trouble of pullin' an LBJ and havin' to pop a bullet in your brain pan. Gentlemen? Enjoy your last ride through Dallas, baby. Won't be in a convertible. Now Gigi, I believe you know the boys. Gentlemen. Miss Cutler, we are gathered here today to ascertain how you came to lose so much so quickly that we may, God willing, avoid such losses in the future. Testify. Our losses were well within, - well within the parameters... - Shut up! Just shut the hell up! Now, I don't know where the hell you think you are but this is Houston City, this is win town, baby! I got a skyscraper full of victorious sons of bitches, damn world conquerors and they're wanderin' around like their peckers have been cut off because mama didn't bring home the W. Now, no excuses, G. What the Devil went wrong out west? Gentlemen, I have come to find the Devil has a name. God damn it, Fred! You're growin' Elms, you're in Eden. Almonds, you're east. Central California to be exact. I said four! You did not! Four! There are 53 different types of nuts in the world. Fred! - Son of a bitch! - He was on of 'em. Hey, is that any way to speak to a neighbor? You wanna know somethin'? You were never this mean when Nancy was alive. What the hell did you just say? Hey, Wally. How's it goin'? Make him see some damn sense. Where you goin', neighbor? In the immortal words of our illustrious leader, "Who knows the true meaning "of?" Miss Cutler, had you met the bastard previously? The year before it all started, at a fundraiser for our local government. The Congressman thanks you. The Congressman owes me. Gigi Cutler? You are? Your neighbor. Frederick Stern at my birth and Fred to my colleagues and Freddy if it's personal, so you can call me Fred. Charmed. Are you enjoyin' this? Mm, all these fat cats and big wigs lookin' your way, prayin' to get a smile from Shore Oil's newly appointed representative. Do I detect a hint of hostility? No, hell no. Just plain curiosity. Hm. Freddy. That'd be herself wantin' another spin. Well, it's been a hoot with you, G. Shall we my dear? - Hi, Nancy. - Nice to see you, Sadie. Freddy. Still keepin' it goin', huh, Santi? Someone has to, you're always in your cave. How do you say impertinent prick in Spanish? Nice try. You've been workin' for me for, what? With you. - For me for what, 25 years? - 30. You gotta have enough saved up by now to get a patch of your own. Hell, you could probably buy a piece of mine. You lookin' to sell? Are you makin' me an offer? For this? Hell no. - Ours was a brief exchange. - What the hell? But you could see it in his eyes, - And I say what the hell? - plain as day. The hunger, the greed. Men like that spend their whole lives searchin' for that easy money. I wouldn't touch it without gloves. The Devil didn't realize it yet, but he'd finally found his in us. After you discovered the pollution, how did you proceed? With someone desperate, someone ambitious, morally malleable. Farm boy turned advertising hack. Alex Gardner. Sansei Aqua. Pure as the pond, fresh as the sushi within. Pardon? No, this is just part of my creative process. I had this perspective client, Sansei Aqua, top ranked Japanese themed vitamin water brand. Hey, should I be wearin' one of those. Yep. What? You know what this is, Alex? For every gallon of crude oil sucked from this Earth comes 15 gallons of? Water. No good to any living thing. What's wrong with it? Besides the fact that it's radioactive? You're joking. Is cancer a joke? What's it doin' here? Evaporating, percolating, and it travels. Want some water? It'll rot your pipes. I know what I'm gonna be doing tomorrow. Listen to this. "My daughter Ivanka, "will be on "Fox & Friends" tomorrow morning. "Enjoy." I will. She's cute. How are the trees? We're gonna need some help. Are you in the market? You think I'd be sitting here with you if I could afford a boat? So you're browsing? - Hm. - Browsing. What are you doin' Santi? What the hell are you doin'? What? What? Why are you takin' a picture of Nancy's... It's been a year, Fred. Santi, Santi, I'm sorry, I didn't... You're too heavy! If I fall, I fall on you. Communist bastard! I'm not a communist! I'm an anarchist. Nobody knows the difference. You got your finger in my eye! Well you got your finger in my nose. Get your finger outta my nose. I'm too old for this. Are you kiddin'? My ass so God damn heavy. Okay. Tomorrow. - Okay. - Get outta here. Okay. You're outta beer. Out. All right. You shoot him? I shot it, I killed it, I dressed it and I put it on my wall. Kinda kidding, I thought that was a prop. Now, I buy your ad and you buy Fred Stern's property. It is a win win. Why me? Alex, what I am offering you is big. Its now. It is Royal Shore Oil. I mean, look around, huh? And Stern, well, he's salt of the earth. He's a farmer. He's never gonna trust my lawyers, but an old friend? And we'll be fair to him. No you won't. What do you got there? Pretty close, huh? Where the hell did you get this? EBay. Alec Gardner. Saw him in town, he wants to buy you dinner. Us dinner. Dinner? Yeah, sure. When? Tonight or I can reschedule it, but it's a free dinner. No, tonight's, tonight's... Alex was always... Yeah. Okay, I'll pick you up around six. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Sure, but Santi? I'll see you at six. I just said that. Yeah, well, that's why I heard it then. Well, well, well. Santi, baby, hey. - Oh, a hug. - Fred, what are you feedin' this big boy? - It's nice to see - Fantastic. - you again, Sir. - Good to see you back. Honey... Fred, Santi. Thank you, Maggie. This was 70 years in the making, okay? A family business. Stern was never gonna sell. So, I threw him a curve. Fred, you know Gigi Cutler? Sure, she seems like a smart lady. She is a big fan of yours, and she actually just gave me the inside track on some offers they're gonna be makin' to farmers around here. I asked her if I could sound you out. Well, what would the great Shore Oil want with the Stern's? They want your pore space. Our what? Your pore space. What's that? May I? Pancakes, that's your land. And this strawberry syrup, that's the ground water runnin' beneath your land. Now, as you know ground water 'round here's lousy with salt. Totally useless for irrigation, just like this berry flavored bullshit ain't fit for human consumption. This ground water, that's gonna soak up into the lower layers of the dirt, but the surface, the surface is gonna remain dry, tasteless. That's why you and everybody else around here, you gotta pipe in the pure stuff. That doesn't exactly answer my question. What do we have here? You see that? See this right here? Those air holes that's lettin' the syrup soak in there good and bad? That's your pore space. And that fellas, that is what Shore Oil wants to buy. I was buyin' a air, space, nothing, everything. What this? These air holes? Why? Because they wanna get to the strawberry syrup down there. That salty ass ground water, it turns out is an easy base for hydraulic fluid. They're tellin' me 50,000 for the whole kit and caboodle. $50,000? Why do you think I called ya? I want 70. - Fred... - No. 70 grand and it's yours. I only got a contract for 50. - Well, I... - You got a contract on you for $50,000? Fred, this is a scam. Now hold on here. Are you callin' me a liar? Listen, quit that country bumpkin bullshit, Alec. It's Alex. Well, Alec, why did you come to us? Fred, you want $70,000 you better tell your boy here to take a walk. - Santi, Santi... - Who you callin' boy? Santi, just go wait - in the car. - No. - Santi wait in the car. - No. Wait in the car. Do you need a refill - on your syrup? - Santi do not do... - Hey. - Oh, that's just great. Maggie, I'm sorry. I got it Maggie, I got it. - Yeah. - Santi, Santi, Santi. I should probably go, too. Alex? Are you playin' me? How long have we known each other? Are you? Fred, it's me, man. It's Al. Okay. To hell with the whole damn valley. If Shore wants what I got, $70,000's my minimum, you understand? Yeah. Now, I'd like more. Can I get more? Huh? I'll do my best. You got another rag? Sure, Fred. We'll be talkin'. Yeah. I own the space, and the water that travels through it, and the poison that lies within. Fred. It's not just here. Tell me you didn't sign that deal. Water. It's the water. You son of a bitch. Fred... Hey, come on, come on, Fred. Hold on, Fred. Fred, oh, come on! - Alex! - There's someone after me! - Who? - Did you hear what I said? He's comin' after me! - Who's comin' after you? - Oh, God! - Fred! - Hey! Stern, did he sign? - Come on, Fred. - Stern, did he sign? Alex? - Come on Fred! - Hey! - Fred, it was all her! - Alex! - I didn't know! - Hey, bozo! God damn it. Fred. Oh, you yella son of a bitch. Fred, please, I didn't know. God! Gigi, I can't go to prison. - Sure you can. - Well, Gigi Cutler. Fred, please. I can't, I'm sorry, Fred. Lady, you better tell me what's goin' on right now. I bit my tongue. Well, that's too bad. You're gonna need that where you're goin'. America's farmers are killin' themselves in record numbers. You like where you're goin'? You know what? I'm gonna find out what's been goin' on with my water and when I do... Hey Stern? How much, right now? Everyone's got a price. Ha! Well, somethin' tells me we're gonna be figurin' that out together. I'll be seein' ya. I got all the money in the world, boy! Had the poison not risen to the surface, Mr. Stern woulda signed that deal. This particular conversation, is in thanks to my predecessor. You tryin' to pin this on me? Those pits were dug under your tenure. Miss Cutler, the board's issue is not with the pollution itself, but with your failure to cover it up. Then I shoulda been made aware of it when I took over. Oh, come on, what? If you buy a house you gonna blame the last owner because it catches fire? Only if the house was yours. Gentlemen, let's get back to the issue. Stern smelled blood and so he found a lawyer with an appetite for fortune equal to his own. The man who killed the Pinto. This bastard killed the Pinto? Dead. Thank you, John. Safe journey. Come in, come in. Hey, are you Ralph Egis? Aegis, A-E-G-I-S. You been waiting long? - Well... - Sorry about that. You can sit but before we begin, lemme just say, I'm not interested in petty squabbles or seeking settlements. If you're here for such I'd be happy to refer you to any of my esteemed colleagues. Is that a Ford Pinto? No, Sir. That is the head of the fiery dragon, Pinto, which I engaged in mortal combat in the late '70s. Huh. Shitty God damn car, not a great pony. Ask him. He was Ford at the time. We was slingin' Pinto's like cocaine cupcakes. I was pretty hot back then. So was the Pinto, of course. So hot in fact that its fuel tank would ignite and burst into flames if it got hit in a rear end collision. Nothin's perfect. Nothin's for free. Which amounted to 180 burn deaths a year in the U.S. alone. - Now... - Accidents happen, people die. According to an internal Ford memo, it would cost the company $11 per Pinto to fix the problem with a recall. But with 12,000,000 of 'em on the road, that would cost $137,000,000, compared with $50,000,000 to maintain the status quo. Nobody wants to blame their baby boy, oh, little Miss Suck A Dick for their own emulation. They want deniability. Ford did the math. $137,000,000 to solve a $50,000,000 problem? "No, problem. "Let 'em burn," and they did. And our Pinto's unique, cheap and patented design provided the perfect patsy. Eventually, thank God, a disgruntled Ford employee blew the whistle and got us the internal memo. And then some low life leaks our book keepers doodles and before you know it, just like that, the Pinto falls from grace. Took Ford to court in a class action and I took the Pinto's head. Bad year for business, '78. Good year for barbecue. What's your name again? Fred Stern. I think I might have what you're looking for. You found me a dragon? The dragon found me. There are these, too. Why are you doing this? They're poisoning my farm. Obviously. And they're trying to buy me off with a measly five figures. Could they do it for six? Seven? How much would it take, Mr. Stern? See, that's the key question. And I am left to wonder if you're here to slay a dragon or get paid off by one. Let me know when you decide. Hello. Damn it! Who the hell does he think he is? Who the hell is this? Are you Fred Stern? Yeah. What are you doin' here? Oh, I wanted to... I need to... Need to do what? I'm sorry, I should go. No, no, wait a second. Did Gigi Cutler send you? No. No, but I heard what she did and I just wanted to help. You wanna help me? Yes, Sir. Why? Why would you wanna do that? Gigi's a bitch. You want a cup of coffee? These are really good, Fred. Yeah, yeah, my wife painted 'em. Oh. Is she a professional artist? No, no, she passed away. I'm sorry, I didn't... That's all right. So, you wanna help me? Well, why are they all boats? No need to be nervous, all right? Just, why don't you sit down? Yeah. So, you got something on Gigi Cutler, huh? What is it? This about a memo or somethin'? I shouldn't be here. Fred, I should go. Yeah, yeah, boats, boats. Yeah, there is a lot of 'em. You see, they're, well, when my wife and I were kids she had a dream that we would sail around the world together one day. Well, did you? No, no, we had a farm to run. Work and life. Life gets in the way of life. So we didn't but she painted it, our journey. That one's us leaving Long Beach Harbor. The one above the mantelpiece is us sailing into Cape Town, and the one above your head, that's us gettin' caught in a storm around in the horn. She didn't finish that one. No, no. She died before she could. That's you and Nancy comin' home? Yeah, that's exactly what is. It's... Yeah, I never told anyone that before. And everyday I regret the... I never told you her name. Wow. How filthy you must feel right now. Hawkin' your dead wife's memory for a slim shot at a leg up. Oh, Freddy. How the hell did you know... Shh, shh. Excuse me. I gotta take this. - I'm here. - Farmer turn you out? No, I'm drinkin' his piss poor coffee - in his shit hole of a house. - All right, make him see. Yeah, I'll bring him around. Who the hell are you? Why don't you just sit down there, hoss? No, you're leavin'. I have a message to deliver. You know, you are trespassing. I could kick your butt and the cops wouldn't even blink an eye. Could you, though? And even if you do I'm still gonna keep comin' back. You get the hell outta my house right now. Okay. I'll get the hell outta your house. The message is this. You're never gonna get even close to what's owed you, so drop it. There's a million reasons why you should and you're gonna wake up to every single one of 'em in your bank account if you do. A million isn't even close? Oh my. Dumb and put upon. You are a peach, Freddy. Oh, God damn it! I forgot the if not. If you don't drop it, Mr. Stern, I'm gonna start takin'. I ain't gonna stop. They don't pay me to stop. I'ma take everything. I'll take everything you love, everything you made. I'ma take it all, if not. - Your chair's on fire. - Huh? Damn it! Whoa! God. That's nice. This the Pinto, right? I like it, good car. No, no. Ralph, thanks for comin' in. - I... - Is he with you? - Yeah, he... - Oh, I was about to call the cops. I'm sorry, man. So what did you decide? A man offered me a million dollars tonight. Hm. And? I said no. Why? Because they owe me more. They're poisoning my home and it may not be much but it was ours and it was a good home. You can ask Santi. Ralph, they may have poisoned my wife. We might not be able to prove it but they're gonna rob me of that, of our life, I'm gonna rob them of theirs. - Hm. - You know how much money they've made poisoning my land? 2.1 billion dollars and that's just one year. Over 10 years? - At least. - Hm. Hm. Well? Well, I'd say they owe you at least a year. Well, are we gonna do this or? I'd say there's enough room over there for an oil rig. This okay with your anarchist principles? For 2.1 billion, are you kidding me? Let's do it then. Two! $2,000,000,000 Olive! That's two too many and way too much. Slow your roll. Let me take a look at the summons. All right, negligent trespass. Ralph Aegis representing. I mean, it's gonna be tough. If you can't beat 'em then I should just call 777. Well, he was big in the '80s but you know what Sun Tzu said about underestimating your opponents. What's that? Don't. Drink? Howdy! Oh, God! Fuck, what is that? What was it? Clumsy. Who are you? I'm from Houston. That's in Texas, Ma'am. Like all my exes. Did corporate send you? Yep. - I didn't ask for any... - Help? Who the hell do you think you are? I think I'm from fuckin' Houston. Oh boy. Come here. - Sorry G. - Come on, come sit down. - Oh, Christ. - Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - There's a switch on the front. Whew. Hey Texas, my net worth isn't puke. I know. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have cursed at a lady. I just, I don't like to repeat myself. You have to understand, Gigi, I'm just here here to help. See, if this farmer is successful with this lawsuit, then he has established a precedent. No shit, it's gonna be open season for all the big boys. Anyone, anyone who's ever taken a piss in a peasants pond. Oh, I'm not gonna let it happen. No, me neither. What are you gonna do about it? You hear that? Just listen for a second. Just close your eyes. I'm listenin'. That is the sound of progress uninterrupted. That is the sound of money found and fortunes won. That's not just a lawsuit, Gigi. It's a revolution. We lose, we die. So they send you. Guys, I'm gonna , I'm gonna take a walk. I'll be over here if you need me. I'm here to bring Stern to the table, Gig. He's not gonna come on his own, and I'm gonna bring him to his knees. In the event that my learned colleague for the defense tries to convince you that this is a very complex case, kindly permit me to offer a very, very simple analogy, okay? Let's say for example your next door neighbor runs a dog kennel and one day one of their dogs escapes, and he wanders over onto your property and he beats right on your lawn. Well, and no offense to the court, but shit happens but what would you expect from that neighbor? Well, bottom line that they would come over and apologize and clean up their mess and assure you that this would never happen again, am I right? End of story. But now, what if you found out that for the last 10 years, that dog and 20 other dogs like it, were in fact trained to come over onto your property and dump tons of canine excrement right on your front porch. What would you expect from that neighbor now? Well, you can't even say can you? No, of course not. Because you cannot possibly imagine such a scenario being true. Well, I'm here to assure you that it is true, that it has been happening for the past 10 years to my client, Mr. Fred Stern, that it continues to happen as we speak and the perpetrator, Shore Oil, knew from the start all about it and they did absolutely nothing but profit to the tune of $20,000,000,000 over the last 10 years. Well, friends, we're gonna prove our case, and we are gonna extract $2,000,000,000 from Shore Oil in compensation and we're gonna use it to clean up their mess and we're gonna make damn sure that their irresponsible destruction of the environment for profit ends with your verdict. Thank you. Your honor, may I approach the bench? Yes. I have to go to the toilet very badly. Go. Thank you, thank you. God. Fred, listen, I'm gonna go to the toilet. Take notes on everything she says. - I'll be right back. - What? Miss Gore. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that dog just don't hunt. Now, Shore Oil has always been environmentally responsible. That's not what this is about though, is it? This, this is Fred Stern's personal crusade to gain wealth and to push his leftist agenda. We've all seen the news. We've all seen the deterioration of the great industries of this country. Jobs fleeing to China, while more and more jobless immigrants pour in, taking what little we've got. Fred Stern doesn't see it this way. No, he sees this as a move in the right, the left direction. What was your strategy as the case moved forward? It was nut cuttin' time. Starve Stern out in court, smother him in political diatribe while your man forced the issue from the outside. A little help from Alex Gardner. Gigi, confession. Take one. Gigi confession, take... - Alexander. - I didn't mean to, - I didn't mean to... - Alexander James... - It just went off! - Shut your fuckin' whimperin' boy! Failed actor, disgraced ad man, turned into a cold blooded killer. Who knew you had such balls. I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I just want... Oo. I just wanted my job back. I was just. No, no. I just wanted... You wanted redemption. Hm. Oh wow. Oh, you poor boy. Broken. It's gonna be all right. - Yeah. - You gonna tell her? Mm mm. Not me. Not her. You're not? What the fuck did I just say to you, boy? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Shh, shh, shh. What are you doin'? Same thing as you. Killing Gigi. But why? Why? Big Boss sent me. Ruination. What do you think this whole case is for, huh? Why do you think that farmer's askin' for billions? 'Cause I made it so. Me. No. Say you came to kill her. Say it. I came here to kill Gigi. That's right. That is right. You are way more than they think you are, Alex. You are. We are. I'm gonna build somethin' here. Me. I want you buy my side, but I need to know that I can trust you, Alex, with even my deepest darkest secrets. Darkest secrets. So... What do you say, boy? What? Okay, we'll give most of it away to charity. You happy? It's a noble plan, comrade. Don't call me that. Why not? You rob from the rich, you give to the poor. Tell me comrade, you gonna donate your billions after you get your boat, or after you buy your skyscraper? Santiago. You gonna put your name on it? You think I'm doing this for money? You think you'll have a problem if I say something about, you know? No, go ahead. At the end, you were so obsessed with beating it that, you couldn't accept it when she lost. It wasn't beautiful. Losing her was never gonna be pretty. Losing yourself, that was the ugly part. Fighting these pigs, that's good. Don't confuse fighting with living and distraction with healing. You think they might kill you? Yeah, they probably will. $2,000,000,000. I'd do it for half. You? You'd do it for free. Yeah, I would do it for free. You smell that? Smell what? Smoke. The trees. Santi, there are a lotta men in there. You take the north, I'll take the south side. Stop, the wind's changing! We gotta get outta here. - Santi... - There's nothing more we can do! Go, come on! They burned my trees, Ralph. 20 acres gone up in smoke. We can't prove it was them, Fred. We need facts. They don't care about facts. They just, they, oh God. They just want, they just, they want drama. No, they want blood. They wanna see my writing Gigi Cutler's name - in my own viscera. - Prove it was them, Fred. We need proof. South ranch needs spraying. Scientific evidence, Fred. We don't need to pull any heartstrings. We're gonna need more hands for the harvest, too. So what do you suggest, Fred? Alex Gardner. We flip that sleazy bastard. We get him to testify for us and then Shore Oil will be dead in its own poison water. - If we could find him. - Found him. Well, where the hell is he? Where'd he go? My source says he blew town when he got canned. That means he could be anywhere. Nope, he's right here. Will you please shut up? I'm trying to do some work here. What? Santiago, why do I even let you in the house? Fred? Yeah, hold on, Ralph. Just a second. - Well, Koko I'm not just here - Ralph? To dance with your lovely cohost. Ralph, turn on your TV. - Doug, take notes you slob. - What for? I am here to make an announcement on behalf of Shore Energy about somethin' we're doin' to change the way we do good in this county. We are starting the first ever non-profit community wish fulfillment foundation. Wow, well it sounds sweet, Alex, but let's be frank. What do I have to be riddled with to get my wish fulfilled? All I care about. Nothin' at all, Koko. This is for everyone. Teachers, preachers, doctors, coaches. You apply, we supply. Cash money money. Exactly. From this day forward, Shore Energy is gonna be here to help bring this community home. Energy? It's got a nice environmentally responsible ring. That's not your call to make. No, I was outta line. And Gardner. He will not represent this firm. G, keeping Alex smiling keeps us safe. Kid's a star. He's an embarrassment, a liability. But at the end of the day, whose fault is that? Not you. You brought him in, you cut him out. What'd you expect was gonna happen? He was just gonna disappear. I would've... - What? - I would've... What would you have done? Hm? Answer me, now! Go ahead. Moo. Miss Gore, from this moment forward you will report directly to me on all case related matters. You know, Gigi, I watched you rise. Shatter that glass ceiling, and cut throats with the shards. Don't make me call Houston. You are in fact, Professor John Orlan, PhD? Is that correct, Sir? This is cold, hard, professional facts. This proves in fact, a sample extracted from Fred Stern's ground water on March 27th, 2017. Is that correct? Your Honor, requesting permission to enter into evidence... The day has finally come. Here it is. Welcome home! On behalf of Shore Energy, we would like to award you $4,500! Wow! $9,500! Now that's gonna be $10,000! That's nice! Get in there. Mr. Stenson what you're telling me is that this is clean water? This is clean water and this is clean water and that's Fred Stern's farm, and you're telling me that this is 100% usable water for all irrigation purposes? Mr. Stern, do you know what the net present value rule is? No, I don't. Have you ever heard of the net present value rule? No. Has any member of the court? Miss Gore? Your Honor, do you know what the net present value rule is? I'm quite certain you are about to tell us all. Proceed, Mr. Aegis. Thank you, Your Honor. May it please the court. The net present value rule states, if you make more money doing it than what it would cost if you get caught doing it, continue doing it. Objection, Your Honor. Leading the witness. Sustained. - Get to the point, Aegis. - Very well, Your Honor. Now then, Mr. Stern, there's no doubt that your land has been polluted by contaminated waste water. Help me to understand something, please. Do you believe that a multinational corporation like Shore Oil needed to do what you say they'd done? No. No, I, I think they needed to do just the opposite. But surely you can't expect us to believe there was any intention to destroy your farm. I mean, what was - there to gain? - The silver fox is asking all my questions. Well, I don't think they intended it. Just like I don't think BP intended the Deepwater Horizon to blow sky high. But this isn't about intentions. If I'm not mistaken, this is about responsibilities. Now, Shore Oil knew what was happening but they didn't stop pumping their waste water into those ponds. They didn't build any barriers, they certainly didn't let me know what was up. They just sat on it, pumping their poison into my earth. But aren't you assuming they knew? Well, if they didn't why did they offer to buy more pore space? Good question, Mr. Stern. Why don't you answer it? Well, they offered to buy it because Gigi Cutler knew, and that's why she sent Alex Gardner to make me an offer of $50,000, and then if I'd taken that I'd have lost everything, everything. But I said no. Kinda makes me wonder how many people say yes. How many hard working people get trumped on by these companies and then they can never tell the tale. Now, I've been accused of bein' some kind of an environmentalist and a green peace person, a crusader. But that's not fair, I don't rate that. I'm just an American farmer. I do battle with Mother Earth every damn day. Thank you, Mr. Stern. Your witness. Mr. Stern. You come here often? Yes, I do. I like to look in on things myself. Hm, that's nice. And your business, that which you accused my client of ruining, who looks after that for you all day - every day you're here? - I have a foreman. His name is Santiago Compestella. Santiago Compestella. Santiago Compestella. All right. If you should somehow prove your case and be awarded $2,000,000,000, would Shore Energy have to close its doors... Objection, Your Honor. - Irrelevant. - Sustained. Putting half a community of hard working patriots out of a job because of one man's selfish... Objection, Your Honor. Move to strike. Sustained. Miss Gore, that is enough. There's an alien in these parts, of the illegal Mexican variety. Mm hm. Santiago Compestella. Hm? But don't worry, I've taken the necessary precautions to make sure that he'll be deported, tonight. Are you trying to impress me, with your parochial intimidation tactics? Oh, you're so cute. Oh. Touch me again. What? Like this? You know, I could protect you. You're an excuse of a man. A sad excuse? Poor excuse? A drunk excuse? Little piece of free advice. When you're offered a shot of salvation, you should probably take it. Slither away. Slither. Oh, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi. Yeah. You have no idea how high I intend to fly do you? Snakes don't fly. Well, watch me soar. Venmo? I don't have it. Instagram , Facebook. What can I get you? Tallest glass of beer there ever was. Comin' right up. Santiago Compestella. My, my, my, you are a long ways from home. You have a problem? Back off. Juan, Carlos, Rodriguez. How goes it boys? And how's your mama? She must be missin' Juarez somethin' fierce. What about you, Gloria? Do you pine for chihuahua? Not them. I'm warning you. Oh. He's warning me. Well, I guess I better explain a little somethin' to you taco lovers. This is not your country. This is not your world, it's mine. And I will use, abuse and discard you just as I see fit. So step up or walk on. You know, you're not gonna be able to get away with this anymore. Said the Indian to the calvary. I tell you what, why don't you put that stinking Mexican mouth all over my big sloppy... Well, holy shit, we got an uppity wetback. I hope you suck as soft as you hit. That felt good, I gotta say, but can you please, can you please just give me one more. Come on, hit me again you spent bitch. Holy shit. Okay, that'll do. What was that? This car belongs to that. Is this true? The assault? No. But the arson , yes. I seen your papers, Santi. You saw papers. Forgeries? - They were good. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, real good and really stupid. How could you have done... You son of a bitch. You know how this is gonna look. Tell me, Fred, how is this gonna look? Like I'm going around burning things in the town? No, I'm an illegal with a bone - to pick and I got - It's gonna look like - a lotta reason why I should. - I've got a damn terrorist running my farm. This is about the case. Yeah, of course it's about the case. What did you think it was about. I mean, how could you have been so ungrateful to do this to me? Sir, can you take me back - to my cell please? - To me? - Santi, really, please. - You know what - I'm gonna miss, Fred? - Oh, what? You know? My phone. You okay? You look like shit. I must've called 40 times last night. Why the hell didn't you pick up? I had to shut off the phone so I could focus on today. We're gonna sink a showboat. Ralph, you need to know something. - It's... - All rise. Mr. Aegis? Are those gonna be the witnesses? Thank you, Your Honor. Good morning, Mr. Gardner. Good morning, Ralph. Did you or did you not make my client, Fred Stern, an offer to buy his pore space? I just wanted to help him out. It's kinda what I do. And this is before you actually worked for Shore Oil? Do you remember a time when you didn't have to work some place to help out a neighbor? So you thought you were doing Mr. Stern a favor by covering up the fact that Shore Oil was polluting his farm? The fact? Come on, Ralph, you're better than that. Excuse me, Sir, are you now denying - that you made Mr. Stern... - I'm not denying anything. You got your scientific mumbo jumbo and your test tubes and beakers and whatnot. But I actually know this man. I worked for him everyday in high school in between football practice and helpin' out my mom. You paint a heroic picture of yourself, Sir. I just like to look for the good in folks, and Fred, Fred is a class act. But times are tough. Money is tight and ever since Nancy passed away, and the fact that he's had an illegal runnin' his farm, I figured he needed the money. Objection, Your Honor. - That's irrelevant. - What? It's true. Move to strike. Sustained. Control your witness, - Mr. Aegis. - Would it were possible, Your Honor. Do you not want them to hear? What is it that Abraham Lincoln said? Do you remember the words of our President Abraham Lincoln? "The truth will set you free." Actually, Mr. Gardner that was Jesus. John 8:32. Oh. Well, I do think there are more subtle ways to let anyone know that you go to church on Sunday. Thank you, Your Honor. No further question. I am done with this witness. Thank you, Ralph. Miss Gore. Thank you, Your Honor. Alex, pleasure. It's all mine. I am just happy to finally set the record straight. Great. Tell us about that night at Ozzie's. What happened? He said and I quote, "To hell with the whole damn valley. "If Shore wants what I got, they can have it all. "But I need to take them for every last cent I can. "70,000's my minimum, you understand? "I want more." I never woulda thought that he was talkin' billions. Screw you, Stern! Order! Order! I'd like to enter into evidence an arrest report for Santiago Compestella, - an illegal alien - This is what I was trying - who has been - to tell you about - on Mr. Stern's payroll - this morning. - for over 30 years. - Objection, Your Honor. Irrelevant. Sustained. Miss Gore, Mr. Aegis, join me in chambers immediately. Miss Gore, I will not have grandstanding in my courtroom. Your Honor, I was simply making evidence available. Oh, come on, Olive. You wanna play dirty, fine. But for God sakes show a little class. Compestella's crimes must be made known - to the jury. - It's already public record, Your Honor and need I remind my esteemed colleague that being an undocumented immigrant is not a crime. Yet, but arson and assault are. Also, there's this. Susan? What's this all about? This is new evidence I would like Your Honor to review before we enter into public record. Oh my, what a concept. Would you like to use the restroom before the movie starts? I think I can hold it. We'll see. Why is he naked? Technically he's in a towel. Was in a towel. Ralph, it's just hearsay, right? That's all they got. You said so yourself. What are you talkin' about? They just knocked us out. Well, it's my word against his, right? Did you say it? Okay. So, what do you wanna do now, lie? No, I wanna win. I gotta win this, Ralph. They're poisoning my water. You've had an undocumented immigrant running your farm for 30 years and now they have a security video of you running around naked and threatening Gardner with a golf club. Oh, come on, I just... You know what that jury sees now when they look at you? A con artist, a thief. And when they get a load of that video in court, you're gonna look like a lunatic, too. So, go ahead, double down, lie, be like everybody else, but don't expect me to be a part of it. It's over. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, it does no end like this. What, what, do they get to drag me through the dirt and steal everything I've got and then they just get to walk away? Maybe we can work out some kind of settlement and you can start over. Yeah, well, that's probably the way you killed the Pinto, right? With the deal? Some kind of dragon slayer you are. Oh, go to hell. All you ever really cared about was the money anyway. All you ever cared about was bein' relevant. Am I right? Has been. At least I was. Fred, you still there? He's through. Offer the settlement. Is she even necessary anymore? Be nice. We got him ball the balls. Now you take his head. You drank the Kool-Aid, haven't you? Alex is right. Who's gonna come after us after we burn him into the ground? Nobody. His lawyer. He finds somethin', some proof that we knew. What, are you gonna tell him? This is bullshit. I got a thing to get to. So, you can handle this, right, Boss? Oh, yes, Sir. - Gigi, I... - Oh, I've been meanin' to tell you, I'm gonna reach out to your firm. I'm gonna make a point of tellin' the partners how optimistic I am about your future. Do you think you can do my job? Oh, babe, I already am. It's feelin' pretty permanent. Like death? Shoulda took my advice. Don't worry, you'll get your stock options. Golden parachute, all that shit. That is if we win. If we lose... Go to hell. I like it here. Oh come on, Wally. You know I'm not what they say I am. You can't just die. Yeah, I'm right here. I'm right here, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna sit you up. I got to. It's too late, Fred. No! Hell, I mean, no! Get over here. Mr. Stern. Come here, come on. Santi, what am I gonna do? Oh, come on, come on. Don't do this. Please, please. It's been quite a spell, I know. You might not like me much anymore, girl. God, I miss the hell outta ya. I'm not here. You better not be. Quiet, Freddy. Listen to me now. Who's ready? - Me! - You? I'm ready, girl. Shore Energy, we thank you! What are you doin'? Same thing as you, killing Gigi. Mr. Stern, nice weekend? - Yeah. - Thank you. Yeah, listen, Ralph, I'm sorry I called you a has been. I was way outta line. If anything you're a , you're an is now. Okay, Fred, but I'm still not gonna let you lie. You're not gonna have to. I'm gonna ask for a recess so we can start working on a settlement. - No, Ralph, I don't want a... - Fred, we've got a very good chance for a settlement. Not yet. This is not going well for us. I know, I told you in the bathroom I wanna win, okay? Get Gigi Cutler on the stand. You know something I don't. Get her up there. Okay. Your Honor, the plaintiff calls Miss Regina Cutler to the stand, please. Miss Cutler, to the stand. I'm not even ready for what this is gonna be. Raise your right hand. Regina Cutler... My mother was Regina. Me? Gigi. Gigi Cutler, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? So help me God. Good morning, Miss Cutler. Thank you for joining us. Ask the question, Aegis. Miss Cutler. Lance, let the man do his job. Come on. Ask. Very well, Ma'am. Did Shore Oil continuously poison Fred Stern's ground water for 10 years? Yes. Order. Order. Order. Just unbelievable. I learned the night before that you man was under suspicion by the local police, for arson and falsifying evidence against one of Stern's laborers. Knowing the damage this would cause our case, not to mention our reputation, I had only one option, end it. Yes. Shore Oil poisoned Mr. Stern's ground water. Thank you for that, Miss Cutler. Now, as to the coverup, can you tell the court why Mr. Alex Gardner offered to buy Mr. Stern's pore space? Alex Gardner didn't work for us at the time. He was either lying to Mr. Stern, or he's lying to the court. She's lying! Mr. Gardner, I will hold you - in contempt! - You filthy bitch! - Contempt! - Oh boy. Be silent, Mr. Gardner. Well, hold... Bailiff? I run this shit hole town. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Oo. No, no! - Oh my God. - Un-fuckin'-believable. - You're hurting him. - Fuckin' lying bitch! - Alex! - Fuck you! Stop movin', Sir. - Come on. - Fuck you! You blamed it on Gardner? No one would believe that shit. It as on record and he'd never get a chance to deny it. We settled with Stern the next day. Case closed. Thank you, Miss Cutler. No further questions, Your Honor. Witness is excused. Counselors approach. All right, thank you very much. Your Honor, in light of whatever that just was... We finished? Yeah, looks that way, doesn't it? I'll have your settlement delivered this evening. I don't want your money. I don't wanna give it to you, but the Devil is not the Devil unless he takes his due. No hard feelings. Can I buy you a drink? Kinda early. Where? You know where. I'll see ya. Still hot. Mr. Stern. Can you explain what just happened here? Well, she admitted that they did it, and now they're gonna fill in those ponds and they're gonna clear Santi's name. We settled. What does she get? I don't know, and I don't really wanna know. Yeah. Ralph, hang on for a second. I got you somethin'. Oh? For me? You shouldn't have. Well, maybe not. What's this, the Eiffel Tower? Well, it was the closest thing I could find that looked like an oil rig. I thought it'd make a nice hood ornament for your Ford Pinto. It will indeed. Thank you, Fred. You're more than welcome. Just sorry we couldn't slay the big dragon. We tried, but we'll always have Paris. Yeah, I guess. Well, congratulations, Fred. Mr. Stern, these proceedings are concluded. It's been real. And my boy, what happened there? Hey girly, you come to dance with me in the pale moonlight? I've come to say goodbye. Ah. So you're leavin'. Well, it's about time. I'm gonna settle with Stern. Oh shit, Gigi. You once gave me some free advice. Yeah, what was that? You get a shot at salvation, you take it. Right. So this is your shot, huh? Please don't. Fly now you piece of shit. At Ezekiel 22:27, we're told that princes who tear up their victims, shedding blood, destroying souls all for gain. Your man fell free to such, discovered and disgraced. He didn't fight the inevitable. He did the honorable thing and exited the scene. That guy was a pro. Consummate. What, so he just vanished? I'm sure we'll hear from him again. At the end of the day, having narrowly escaped total disaster, we ended our battle with the Devil. Suffering the insignificant loss of 1% of his ask. I believe, gentlemen, you'll agree, that $20,000,000 is a small price to pay to keep our good work goin' and our souls intact. So that's your story? It's a whopper. If you like that kinda burger. And what if we ask Alex and all of their side of it? Feel free to do so. I have kept Olive on as a legal consultant, and Alex, he's on location in Africa. So you stabbed him in the back and then you bought him off? Respect. Well, it's a cryin' shame that we can't hear what our dearly departed thought about all this. But we can. Big Boss sent me. Ruination. What do you think this whole case is for, huh? Why do you think the farmer's askin' for business? 'Cause I made it so. Me. All right, gentlemen. Let's talk about Iran. It's good to see you. So what's the protocol? Well, traditionally you have to ask for permission to come aboard. Give me that thing. This is your last selfie you'll ever take. No! Shit! What, are you crazy? Free at last. You're free at least. Well that ought to get it. I don't believe this. We're in the middle of the Great Pacific garbage patch. You gotta be kiddin' me. After all this, this is where we end up. Don't look so surprised, Mr. Water Bottles. Oh, Santi. Oh, look at us. You know what? I'm posting this one. Oh, really? And just how are you going to do that, huh?
