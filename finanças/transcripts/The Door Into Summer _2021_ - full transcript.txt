It seems like my fate is to lose the people I love. It all began in 1968. NEWS SUSPECT The year the 300 million yen robber was arrested my mother died soon after giving birth to me. 17 years later my father left this world to go join her. Insignificant incidents to the rest of society. Everybody was looking forward to the future. TELEPORTATION EXPERIMENT The Toi Laboratory of Teito University demonstrated the world's first successful teleportation. The teleportation fidelity was improved by over 100 times. A great step toward practical application. It felt like I was stranded alone in the flow of time. But I never felt lonely. 2-MONTH-OLD MALE KITTEN Right after my father passed on I met Pete. Soon, Pete and I had a new family. Koichi, my father's good friend and fellow professor took us in. His daughter, Riko, loved Pete like a little brother. HEISEI ERA For the next few years I studied electronics at college and mechanical engineering under Koichi in his home lab. I was happy and easily forgot about fate. News flash. A World Airlines aircraft crashed early this morning… But fate apparently didn't forget about me. Riko, then in middle school, went to live with her uncle, Kazuto. And now in 1995. It's just me and Pete again LARGEST MARKET SHARE for almost three years. Credeus policies are hassle-free and affordable. We promise you a happy future. Cold sleep by Credeus Life Insurance. COLD SLEEP INSURANCE Hello. This is "Happy Day" on Wednesday, March 1st. MARCH 1ST, 1995 Today we're here at Future Works Enterprise commonly referred to as FWE. Do you know what they do? They're the developers of A-1 the household robot that everybody's talking about. With artificial general intelligence it continues to learn and grow like a human being and can follow various commands. It was invented by Soichiro Takakura. This 27-year-old joined FWE after he graduated from university… Yes? Is that you, Soichiro? Kazuto… You gave them my photo? I'm surprised you're watching it. Actually, I wasn't but… The photo was unnecessary. Why not? Look! He's very handsome. He's my type. His appearance? He is attractive but he also spent ten years on research… This is great PR. About the manufacturing agreement with Rise Electronics… It's now a little past noon. Snow clouds are still in the sky. Snowfall is expected to continue. The forecast by region. Here it is. I want you to check it. -And the stock assignment… -Pete! Sorry. I'll call you back. Hey… Ever since Pete met me, he has formed a simple philosophy. I'm in charge of shelter, food, and weather. He's in charge of everything else. But he holds me especially responsible for weather. When he sees that cold unpleasant white stuff out the window he badgers me to open every door in the house. Pete firmly believes that one of them is the door into summer. What are you doing? Riko. Sorry. It's still winter outside. No matter how often he fails Pete won't give up his search for the door into summer. You never get bored of this song. Isn't it great? I love it. FOUNDATIONS OF ROBOTICS You enjoy reading this? Yes. It's yours in the first place. Not for schoolgirls. That's why I like it. I can't finish them in a week. RIKO'S MOVE TO NEW SCHOOL Come back during summer break. You won't miss me? It must be a good school if Kazuto chose it. A new robot? No. It's my personal project. PLASMA BATTERY The plasma battery was Dad's… Its practical application is no longer a dream. Machines won't have to be recharged anymore. An energy evolution. It'll also dramatically boost my current robot project. A future that Koichi dreamed of where robots and humans coexist might not be that far away. What? Nothing. All right. Your choice tonight. What do you wanna eat? Hamburger steak with lotus root in it. Again? I'll get it. Yes? Riko, who was at the door? Me. Ms. Shiraishi… I brought some documents you should take a look at. The boss called you, right? Hey, Pete… Did I scare him? Sorry. More like "thanks" to your girlfriend. Right, Riko? Maybe… It's cold today. Let's have hot pot. Riko is going to cook… I have packing to do. I'm going home. Riko? BIG PLATES, GRATIN DISHES, SMALL SERVING PLATES DON'T KEEP WATER RUNNING POTS, BOWLS STOCK ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT FROM SOICHIRO TAKAKURA TO RIN SHIRAISHI Let me help. It's okay. I see where everything is. Riko wanted to make sure I know where things are. She's moving into a school dorm. She did all your housework? She said my time will be better spent on research. That's how I completed A-1. You didn't want Riko to worry? What? Are you with me so she won't worry about you being alone? No… I… Do you care about me? Of course. More than Riko? Why compare? I don't understand. Huh? Why are you giving me a part of your shares? Oh… Kazuto and I discussed it and decided together. It was mostly his decision, right? Are you really okay with it? An accounting secretary is suddenly an executive. Honestly, I was surprised but everybody knows how competent you are. I don't care about owning stock. All I want is for you to focus on your work. But… CLOSE GAS VALVE I'm jealous of Riko. I'm too old for that. MARCH 8TH, 1995 Come in. Sorry. It's okay. I'm done. Take a seat. How are you feeling? Great as long as I have this. Diabetes sucks. How are you? I'm discussing A-1's upgrade specs and the next model with the mechanics. Good. Looking forward to it. What's the urgent meeting about? Excuse me. Let's start a special shareholders' meeting. Shareholders' meeting? Shiraishi, the document. Take the minutes. The date, March 8th, 1995. 13:00. New business plan? Our reputation has grown thanks to A-1. Our competitors are frantically trying to catch up to us. I think we should release A-1 as soon as possible. Put it out in the market? To beat our competition. We'll also expand our business. No. A-1 isn't ready yet. I won't approve further development costs. But the second model… We need at least a third model… We'll sell the rights and gain more capital. Fortunately, Mannix Enterprises is making an offer. Fortunately? I worked too hard on this to hand it over to someone else. You can continue your projects with Mannix. Is it for money? Koichi would never allow this! Mr. Matsushita. Why don't we vote on the proposal? Okay, Soichiro? Yeah. Let's. Fine. Shiraishi, roll call. Yes, sir. Mr. Kazuto Matsushita, do you vote yes or no to this proposal? Yes. Mr. Soichiro Takakura, how about you? A definite no from me. And I, Rin Shiraishi, am voting… Yes. What? With two-thirds of the votes in favor of the proposal, it is adopted. Wait… Ms. Shiraishi… It is also decided that though you will remain a shareholder you will terminate all your connections with the company. Did you guys set me up? This is an official decision by the shareholders. Don't forget the last line. "As of today, you are forbidden to use all company facilities and equipment." Pete, what are you doing in the cold? Soichiro… What happened? Are you okay? -Forget it. -No. You're moving tomorrow. Finished packing? Who did this to your room? Uncle Kazuto? Me. It's my fault. You're lying. Everything was here. Everything you and Dad created. You'd never let it go. This is me! In the end… I lose everything that's important to me. I… will never go away. I'll stay here. I won't move into a dorm. Don't act like a baby. I kept it to myself for years! I thought it was wrong to tell you. It was tough. I… I've always loved you. I want to be with you forever. Hey… What can I do? Nothing. You're just a kid. You'll know what I mean when you grow up. Are you giving up? COLD SLEEP INSURANCE DREAM YOUR TROUBLES AWAY Dream your troubles away. Cold sleep by Credeus. You can choose the length of cold sleep from five years to 30 years. After a medical examination and legal approval you can enter cold sleep that same day. Credeus will invest your assets as you see fit while you sleep. Sorry to keep you waiting. The sleep sanctuary staff says your friend can use the same capsule. You'll both enter cold sleep for the maximum period of 30 years. Lucky you. Happy, huh? Together, right? How fast can we start? About an hour after approval. But if you need more time… No. As soon as possible. I'm afraid I can't approve. Huh? Your blood alcohol level is over the limit. I'm not drunk. I'm totally sober. I've been working here since the early days of cold sleep. Our clients were terminally-ill patients who hoped for progress in medicine. Cold sleepers with dreams of a brighter future. But now, we get people looking for a way out of reality. The more desperate they are, the more they rush into cold sleep. Is that wrong? My point is you shouldn't let alcohol decide to take 30 years from your life. After you sober up, give it more serious thought. If not for yourself, then for someone you care about. Excuse me. What? A re-examination tomorrow at ten. What? Damn it. I thought I'd find you here. Your parents are worried. Let's go home. You go ahead. Okay. Soichiro… ASSIGN SOICHIRO TAKAKURA'S SHARES TO RIKO MATSUSHITA WHEN SHE TURNS 20 FWE STOCK CERTIFICATE When Ms. Riko Matsushita turns 20 you want to assign your shares of FWE stock to her. Yes. I want to make sure it's signed over to her. We'll have our corporate attorneys handle the paperwork. Your boss and his secretary… If I were you, I'd bash their faces in. Are you giving up? No… Running away isn't the solution. Koichi Matsushita left a troublesome will. Splitting the company halfway with the boy he took in. What does everybody see in Soichiro? Don't tell me you've fallen for him. Let's plan our next move. Even with the A-1 blueprints, Soichiro is our only engineer. Don't worry about it. He has another ace up his sleeve. What is it? Plasma battery. We'll poach engineers from other companies to complete them. Any word from the truck? Not yet. Trouble at Soichiro's house? Hello. -This is Takakura. -Soichiro? I'm not home right now. -It's me. Answer the phone. -Please leave a message. Riko. You're home. I was talking to a friend. I'm gonna go see her. Hello. This is Takakura. I'm not home right now. PUBLIC TELEPHONE Hello? She came home? She heard everything. She went to see Soichiro. He's on his way here. He just called. What are you planning? Nothing. Shouldn't you go after Riko? It's dangerous outside in the dark. Soichiro… He went to pick up Riko. You know your way around this house. Did you come here to gripe? I'm seeing a lawyer tomorrow. Your dismissal and recovery of research materials are legit. We haven't breached any laws. I know. The law isn't on my side. So what? I'll disclose everything to the media. The company's reputation will be ruined and you'll lose the public's trust. Will Mannix still want a business like that? And? Renounce the shareholders' meeting and give back my research materials. You… are a badass. Huh? I surrender. I accept your terms. They're back. Kazuto's. No… Don't open it… That hurt! Stupid cat! How dare you! Where did it go? No… Pete… Where did it go? Run… Where? Come here! Damn… Who are you working with? A lawyer? Pete… Soichiro… COLD SLEEP APPROVAL Cold sleep? Cold sleep, like you wanted. But not with Credeus. It's being handled by a Mannix subsidiary. Before I joined your company, I worked for Mannix in the accounting department. I handled a lot of their tax stuff. I have people who owe me favors. Too bad. Say goodbye to your beloved Riko. So long, Soichiro. I lose everything… Too bad. Good morning. Good morning. Your vocal cord seems fine. Can you lift your arms and legs? Good. Your muscles will recover soon. Don't worry. We have post-cold sleep rehabilitation programs. Cold sleep… It's been 30 years. We're in year 2025. 2025… FEBRUARY 25, 2025 But you're… You must be thinking of my father who was with Credeus. But wait… You bought your policy from Mannix Insurance. Mannix? Pete… Where's Pete? Huh? Oh… PETE, come here. You called? No… Um… Pete the cat. Cat? Wait… You need to rest for a few days. This is PETE, a humanoid nurse that'll take care of you. Hello. Nice to meet you. Humanoid… You'll stay hospitalized for the next five days. Your physical condition is the same as it was during your cold sleep but you must stay in this room for a 24-hour observation period. Tonight's recovery meal is… I'm leaving. You can in five days. Tonight's recovery meal is… My clothes? Hey… Would you like meat or fish? I'm leaving. You're a humanoid robot, right? This is a command. Acknowledged. I'll go get the person in charge. What a pain. Huh? Mannix Enterprises went bankrupt during the past 30 years. I'm afraid you have no home nor assets to your name. But rest assured. The Cold Sleeper Relief Policy has been enacted. It's not much but you'll get some financial aid. Also… I only have her address but… a Riko Matsushita called repeatedly to inquire about your awakening. Good morning. I brought your breakfast. BUS STOP INFORMATION - ROTARY INFORMATION Taxi? Yes. But I can't find one… You must use an online app to call a taxi. What are you doing here? Please be more courteous. Nice to meet you. Why "nice to meet you"? What's going on? It's here. Hey… AVAILABLE ON-BOARD Let me show you how it works. Destination, Old District Seven, West 2-15. -Get off. Get off! -Searching destination. -The fare is… -Driver, don't… 1,620 yen. There's no driver. It's fully automatic. It's just us two in the car. Get out of the car. I decline the command. I finally escaped. Huh? I'm apparently defective. An "explore" function overload. The equivalent to "curiosity" in humans. But why come to me? I understand you design robots. If anything happens to me, you can fix me. I don't have the skills. They're 30 years old. Then we'll study together. First, modern society. Wallet, please. Wallet, please. Hey! Cash, paper or coins, are not used. Gold is also worthless. It's plain garbage. You can use this as a wallet. Your subsidies are in your account. This is a wallet? What is Riko Matsushita's address? We're here. Are we? Maybe. Let's check. Wait a sec. You're not coming? I am. But don't follow me. One moment, sir. Don't call me sir. One moment, dude. That's worse. And don't call me a pain either. Riko? I've been waiting for you. Ms. Shiraishi? I knew you wouldn't answer my calls if I said it was me. Come on. Don't just stand there. Want some? I'm still eating that. What happened to you? Nothing worth mentioning. The year after you went into hibernation Kazuto got sick and died. He did? A complication from diabetes. Blood vessels in the brain… Then the company was taken over. I was caught evading taxes for Mannix. I did time in prison. Stop. Enough. Where's Riko? Where is she? I know you planned it! You got me locked up! You froze me in sleep for 30 years! What about your shares! Why does that man have them? That man? They were supposed to be mine. But he suddenly showed up and ruined my plan! Who's this man? Where's Riko? The truck never came back. Oh yeah… It must have burned at the house with Riko. Burned? The day you entered cold sleep. She ran to you. To her beloved Soichiro. But you came to Kazuto's house. Kazuto went after her. Boom! Your house exploded right in front of him. She's been missing ever since. You know what that means. You never give up. Riko, research is… Not a failure if you don't give up. Right? A song from 1993. Riko's favorite. I… just wanted to apologize. But… I have to find out. About the man Shiraishi mentioned. Why he had my stock certificate. Why Riko passed away. Soichiro… Would Pete be happy if there was no winter and only summer? I'm sure he would be. You think so? Yeah. If there was only summer, he might look for the door to winter. I think Pete's like that. He takes after his owner. See? Same face. I'll look for the door. Door? Will you help me? I've been commanded to serve you for five days. We have four more days. Is your program working properly? Let's go. Was the man with your stock involved in Riko's death? It was supposed to go to Riko. We have to find out who he is. COMPANY HISTORY: 1970 - 1979 Here it is. LISTED IN FIRST SECTION OF TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE FWE was acquired by Guardian Manufacturing. Hardly any prior stock info. GLASS MASK Malfunction. I'm fine. It's how humans laugh. AHA-HA-HA-HA Stop it. I see. The purple roses man is… It's time. What? I enter sleep mode for three hours a day. My program is reconfigured with new data… Right. Information is fed through here. Laser sensor? Infrared? What about power? Rechargeable? Self-regenerative energy that lasts semi-permanently. Semi-permanently… Is it…? Take off your shirt. As you wish. Plasma battery. So you're FWE's… No. The humanoid robot market is dominated by FWE &amp; Guardian and Aladdin Industry. I'm an Aladdin product. PETE-13… I want information on any former shareholder. I'm sorry. You must have an appointment to enter the offices. Then make me an appointment. I'm sorry. I can't do that here. Please contact the person in charge. I'm Soichiro Takakura. I invented A-1 and used to work here. Who's the person in charge? I'll have to scan your retina for identification. Retina? Look at this light. I'm an Aladdin. Are you a Guardian? Do you have time later? I decline that command. Please make another one. You're not registered. Please come back after you… What? I'm sorry. I'll show you to the president's office. Mr. Takakura! It's been so long! I'm Gota Tsuboi! This is my company. GOTA TSUBOI, COMPANY PRESIDENT You're the president? Yes. Have we met before? What? -What? -What? I'll find out what I can about the shareholders. Thank you. I can't believe you were in cold sleep. I was inspired by you to start designing robots. I was so moved when I first saw him. You even put the plasma battery to practical use. You're a god. Yes, you are! Huh? Why did you give exclusive rights to Aladdin? Me? The plasma battery? To Aladdin? Mr. Takakura. You really don't remember me? No… Of course not. No problem. You look the same but I was in grade school back then. Grade school? You came to Tsuboi, a restaurant that my family runs. You were on TV and my dad was thrilled that a celebrity had come. My treasure. Wait… You said to me "You'll be a great inventor one day." I signed this book? You came to see Professor Toi. Professor Toi? He was a regular customer. He was arrested for embezzling research funds from the university. TEITO UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR ARRESTED Today's feature story. An interview with Junnosuke Toi who was released on bail. TOI PHYSICS LABORATORY He should be here soon. There he is. Let's go talk to him. Did you really use the money you embezzled for your research? The so-called time machine… Time transfer machine. Yes. I'm sorry. It's written in here. Give it to me. Polarization around a third axis will negate the gravitational fields and take it into the minus zone. I don't get it. Of course not. You're a layman. But only one thing matters. This theory transcends time! Look! This theory! It's… PROFESSOR TOI INTERVIEW If you'd met this man, you'd never forget him. I hadn't completed the plasma battery and had never heard of Aladdin. Someone must be using my identity. A mastermind behind the scenes? How do I do this? Here. Hello? I finally found him. The stock was unlisted back then. Thank you. AS OF APRIL 17, 1996 FWE SHAREHOLDERS 1996… Assigned to Guardian Manufacturing. 1995. Assigned from Soichiro Takakura to Taro Sato. Taro Sato… I was surprised too. The founder of Aladdin was one of our major shareholders. The founder of Aladdin? Here. This man. NEW MARKET LEADER SATO TARO, ALADDIN INDUSTRY Soichiro, look. Patent for PETE-1. INVENTOR: SOICHIRO TAKAKURA The first model's inventor is… you. I invented PETE? Your patent attorney was Taro Sato. PATENT ATTORNEY: TARO SATO And the inventor of the later models is… INVENTOR OF PETE-2: RIKO SATO Riko Sato. A coincidence? You want to assign your shares of FWE stock to her… Why does that man have them? You really don't remember me? Me? The plasma battery? The truck never came back. Professor Toi… He suddenly showed up… Someone must be using my identity. Who are you working with? A mastermind… Taro Sato… It must have burned at the house with Riko. This theory will transcend time! Is it what I think? What is it? This is no coincidence. If I'm right, the mastermind is… TOI PHYSICS LABORATORY Hello! Is Professor Toi here?! Does someone actually live here? Professor Toi! Who is it? Sorry to disturb you. I'm Soichiro Takakura… Excuse me… You're late! Come in! Hey… All right. Onto the platform. Wait a second… No. I'm done waiting. I waited for you for 30 years. So… the time transfer machine… Yes. I completed it. Perfectly and flawlessly. Your presence here today is proof. Then send me back. Wait. I said I'm done waiting. In spite of my intelligence, I don't understand. Why is Soichiro the proof? I had Professor Toi build this machine. You had him build it? So the mastermind is… Yes. Me. We're now in a re-written future. A re-written future… That's right. Theoretically, time runs in a single axis. Parallel worlds don't exist. In other words, it loops. Hey, robot. Strap these onto his body. Sell this gold in the past and fund my research with it. Produce whatever the project requires. It needs energy. Plasma battery. You must succeed. Ten to the 32nd power… It might work in theory but it's still too dangerous. You shouldn't do this. I know. But I'm going anyway. If I can save Riko. But keep your stay as short as possible. Don't contact people unless necessary. Okay. You must come back as you are now to this day 30 years later. So? What are you going to do? I'll enter cold sleep again. This is the 4th day of my service. There's a day left but it seems like I'm relieved of my duties. Yeah. You're free now. Hold on to this for me. Thanks. PETE. I'm glad we met. Transfer back to this day 30 years ago. February 28. Don't move no matter what happens. Okay. Here we go. We're close. Hang in there! Yes! That's it for tonight. A special program, Night Scope, hosted by Yuji Nakajima. The title of this program… Soichiro. Soichiro. Soichiro. Hey. What are you doing? You're awake. You… It's February 28, 1995. 1995… FEBRUARY 28, 1995 You transferred back 30 years in time. You're Soichiro Takakura, the FWE inventor of A-1. I cashed the gold you brought back. It's in here. All necessary research materials are in a room upstairs. When's your next cold sleep? Uh… March 8th. No. 10:00 a.m. on March 9th at Credeus. Room fee for nine days. The cost of research and room fee will be deducted from the gold proceeds. I'm charging you 20% of the balance for legal counsel and services. As Taro Sato, your lawyer and patent attorney. LAWYER TARO SATO You're Taro Sato? He told me everything. PETE… If everything looks good, sign that. I accept it as a business deal. PETE laughed when I introduced myself. He laughs weird. I looked for you in the future. So I heard. Although I'm not 100% convinced, he showed me the device on his back. And Midori loves the thought that you guys are from the future. Sorry for putting you in danger. Why are you apologizing? You had to time transfer because of me. I feel bad. Don't you realize? Huh? Forget it. I was to serve you for another day. No need for an apology. You can't go back to the future with cold sleep. I'll just set my sleep mode to 30 years. No problem. More importantly, do you have enough time? I was almost finished with the plasma battery blueprint. I'll upgrade the second model of A-1 to design PETE. And I'm going to save Riko. The atmospheric pressure from the north is causing snowfall in the region. MARCH 1ST, 1995 The temperature will remain low throughout the night and… MARCH 8TH: THE DAY! March 8th is the day I'll carry out the plan. I have to finish designing PETE and the plasma battery by then. But first, I'm going to go see that man today. RESTAURANT TSUBOI Thank you! Hello. Hello. Hello. Take any seat. What can I get you? I'll… have what he's having. Sure. You're creeping me out. I wanted the same drink, Professor Toi. I have nothing to say to the media. I'm not a reporter. I… came back to this era from 30 years in the future on your time transfer machine. Nonsense. I quit my research. Your research fund. Take it. I can't accept this from a stranger! Hey. You're on TV. Are you someone famous? Takakura joined FWE after… I'm a fledgling inventor. I understand why you embezzled money to continue your research. You got fired. You have time to spare. Gota! It says in this book that nothing is born from denial. Don't worry about this money. I promise your research will succeed. For the check. I'll go get a nice meal. Are you really letting him take your money? Yes. Can I have your autograph? I want to make robots when I grow up. Okay. Here. Gota. You'll be a great inventor one day. Don't give up. Yes? Take a break. -Here. -Thank you. Is he sleeping? He's in sleep mode. The three hours of day that he stops talking. I like how he's so talkative. Midori also enjoys his company. What happened to Midori? A traffic accident two years ago. Before that, she used to compete in three triathlon matches a year. She's still cheerful but she doesn't go out or talk as much. But ever since you guys showed up, she's like the old Midori again. Not us. Just PETE. Why "PETE"? I had a cat, a sidekick named Pete. He loved summer. He kept looking for it. He never gave up. Just like you from the future. Mr. Sato. May I make another request? What is it? Check their tax records. Expose them for tax evasion. The woman's name is Rin Shiraishi. You'll crush the great Mannix Enterprises. Yes. That's the point. Also the patent applications for PETE and the plasma battery. Set up a new company for that. I'll do it. But can you pay for my services? What would you name the company? Me? Let's see… How about Aladdin? Your compensation will be shares of FWE stock and the presidency of Aladdin Industry. President? Me? Fine. One more thing. This is the most important. Midori, do you still want a family? It's something I stopped wishing for. What if it were to come true? I couldn't be any happier. It's March 8th. We're carrying out the plan tonight. When do we leave? It's at least two hours to your house. We had to leave before 11 to load the truck and escape. An hour ago. We won't make it! Don't worry. I'm a humanoid robot from 2025 with state-of-the-art technology. Nothing is impossible. Let's start a special shareholders' meeting. The date, March 8th, 1995. 13:00. Did you guys set me up? This is an official decision. Stop! Let's get out of here! I got you. I'm done. That hurt! Stupid cat! Where did it go? How dare you! Come here! Pete! Good boy. Everything's okay. Soichiro… Riko… Soichiro… Sorry about earlier. No. I'm sorry too. Soichiro. Let's go. Kazuto is coming. Keep her safe. Certainly. I'll be right back. Soichiro… Who are you? Soichiro's child. POWER OF ATTORNEY OVER THE ASSIGNMENT OF STOCK SHARES Are you okay? Yeah. Let's hurry. The house… I did it. Why? You'll lose everything. Riko. Look forward. If you're gonna look back… just look at this. I'm going to tell you about the future. Stay calm and listen. Nice to meet you. I'm Midori. My husband, Taro. Did you tell her? Yes. I told her everything. I'm Riko… Sato. Take it slowly. No need to rush. The FWE stock certificate. Thank you. When you sell FWE to Guardian… Give these to them. This is incredible. Soichiro. You won't make it in time for the cold sleep. Come, Pete. I can't do this. Sorry. I have to go. You're the only thing I have… Riko. You're only 17. You'll keep going to school and continue studying. You'll meet many people and experience many things. There's more to life than me. Thanks, Riko. Don't reject me twice in a day. You idiot. You're right. 30 years from now. I'll regret it in the future. Why don't we wait together for Soichiro to wake up? I'm also "Pete." But… Soichiro, don't you realize yet? What? It was no coincidence that I returned to the past. My decisions will also be part of the future. You proved that with your life. We'll meet again in 30 years. Yeah. -Mr. Takakura. -Sorry I'm late. Your forehead? I fell down. Were you drunk? -No. -Really? I lost all the documents. Are you serious? Unbelievable. Dear Mr. Soichiro Takakura. I was dubious about the strange man from the future. But I have no doubts now. I surrender. Just like you said, ELECTRONICS APPLICATION Riko went to school and studied hard. She met many people and experienced many things. She became an inventor like you and participated in the development of PETE and the plasma battery. I want to celebrate with you right away but I already waited 30 years. I'll wait for you to come see me. When you do, bring Riko with you. 20 years ago she went to sleep like you did in a sleep sanctuary. Yes. There was one mistake in what you told me. Riko was much more unrelenting than you thought. Good morning, Soichiro. Good morning. Pete is still looking for the door into summer. With unwavering conviction, he refuses to give up.
