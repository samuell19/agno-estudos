Wind blows Michael Parkinson: At one time am [I right in thinking you applied for the job as england manager? Jack charlton: Yeah, I did. I wrote a letter... And I never got a reply. So I thought, bugger that, I'm not gonna apply again. Audience laughs Jack: I've found in football, you don't apply for jobs. If they want you... They'll come and get you. Jack: I talk too much, sometimes. I've got to make my point. What're you all clapping for? Audience laughs woman: From england's world cup triumph of 1966 big Jackie charlton has always stolen the limelight. Jack: I talk to everybody, you see? I talk to drunks in pubs. I talk to lords and ladies. Child: You alright? - I'm fine. How are you? Woman: And the competition with brother Bobby has always interested the press. Jack: People say to me “was that the most memorable day of your life?" Joys in management are totally different to joys as a player. Men cheer and applaud Jack: The joy, for me... Was what we achieved in Ireland. Des Casey: '86, that's not the one. '85... I damned it all, but I kept a diary of dates and phone numbers. Aye, I've got it here. Right, ok. It was me that rang Jack. Phone rings on phone Jack, my name is des Casey... The President of the football association of Ireland. On phone: We're just wondering if you would be interested in the job. Imitating Jack "what job? Interested in what job? What're you talking about?" Des, on phone: Manager of our international team. He said... On phone: "I'd have to think about that.” Short and sweet, yeah. Dial tone I rang him up a second time. Phone rings on phone: Jack, des Casey here. I said we would shortlist him if he would take the job. "" he said, "we'll have to wait and see about that." For a third time, I phone him. Phone rings on phone: Jack. Des... "" he said. "I can't understand how you haven't qualified. If I couldn't qualify with that lot," he said "I'd eat my hat." Gay byrne: Did you notice we haven't had a soccer manager for the Republic of Irish team in three months? Haven't lost a match in that time either. Very extraordinary. But I've just been told that Jack charlton has been appointed manager of the Republic football team. Jackie charlton... Des: I can tell you the date and all. "Meeting Jack charlton, Tuesday, 11th of February 1986." And so it began. Jack: I'm here to meet a few people to let them see me and find out what I'm like. I mean, I could talk. You know that for a start. But can I manage? - Crowd laughs Paul mcgrath: / was disappointed, to be honest. After all that's happened in this country... Why would we have to have an englishman of all people to run our soccer team? Man shouts - loud bangs man shouts: Go back, you British cunt! Roddy Doyle: England was the enemy. You had the horrors of the hunger strikes and Thatcher. Gunshot roddy: Her pronouncements about terrorism and any attempt at appeasement. The unified Ireland, that is out. Roddy: She was a brilliant show-woman, but... She was never gonna win over the population of Ireland. Reporter: Factories lie idle and dole queues lengthen. Declan lynch: /n the middle of the 1980s it would have been a deeply dysfunctional tormented individual. The national debt had doubled. Unemployment was hitting 20%. Explosion bertie: There was that feeling that the entire island was engulfed in war and conflict. Explosion niall Quinn: The troubles were at their worst. Nobody would have even given you odds that we'd have an englishman to manage the team. Jack: This is your last chance. Go over, and make your runs in front of the goalkeeper. Man: We had never qualified for a major international championship. It was a shambles. Jack: Come on, let's go! Good run! Jack: Don't do it your way. Do it my way. Understand? Clock ticks pat: Walking him down to the... Boy shouts pat: If I get him moving. Pat: Go and get your hat and coat on. The kids want to go down and feed the ducks. I don't want to go down and see the ducks. Pat: Yeah, well, you've got to. Pat: Right. Go on, you too. You don't want to run? Ok. Jack laughs pat: We still have moments where we can have a laugh. Pat: She has no fear, has she? No. Pat: Are they coming? Jack: Hey! Pat: It's alright. They'll come back. Pat laughs pat: He's not the same Jack. Tell 'em to come in. Pat: Eeh, my garden... Jack: Cold. Pat: It's not that cold. I've not got a coat on. Right. Do you want to take your coat and hat off, Jack? Jack: Yes. Pat: Just now and again, you see... Bits of him. Pat: Strong lad. It's heavy. Pat: It's just that his memory's not there. Indistinct chatter Take your coat and hat off now. Pat: And it's a shame... Because... he's had some good memories. That's a condition. It's dementia. But that's as far as I can tell you. John charlton: Does that fit ya? See if it fits ya. John: He has good days. He has bad days. There, look. - Girls laugh that's it. - Jack cackles John: He'll watch the game and I'll say to him "did you watch the game?" And he'll go, "which game?" I'll go, "newcastle." "Yeah, yeah." But he can't tell you anything about the game. Jack: Go... go get your brother. Go get your brother. Go get your brother. Jack: I do a bit of speaking and maybe when I talk football, it's all memories, you know. The days I played with england, the time I spent with Leeds. Like... the greatest goal Bobby charlton ever scored... For england. Come on. Tell me. - Man: Mexico. Mexico, 1966. A 35-yard flyer. Crowd cheers but what you don't remember about that goal was I gave him the ball. Audience laughs audience applauds Jack: Everybody in ashington would tell you that Bobby charlton was gonna play for england. Spectators roar he's strong. Good skills. He had everything, our kid. Cissie: Bobby had been the star for a long time. Jackie had fought his way up. The proudest moment was when they both came out of the tunnel at Wembley together. Then Jack had reached Bobby's peak. Male commentator: 97,000 people paid over £200,000 to see it, the greatest soccer game ever played in these islands. Jack: / remember I headed more balls in the last 15 minutes and I always seemed to be able to head balls. And I remember Geoff running away from me. Hugh Johns: Hurst goes forward, he might make it three. He has! - Crowd roars Jack: And I stood there, and I was absolutely shattered. Thank god that's over. Clock ticks Jack: Somebody took a picture of it. And it became quite a famous picture, actually. John: And then in here, which it didn't come in originally it was just a cardboard box, but that's his medal. Jack: Good gracious me. Pat: World championship. Jules rimet cup. 1966. Man: What was it like playing for the first time with your elder brother in the international side? It was just an ordinary thing for me. Same as any other centre half. Jack: There were two years and eight months between me and our kid. I had to looked after him during the day make sure that he was ok. I didn't like it. I liked the sea. I liked the countryside. And Bobby didn't. He liked to be around my mother. He liked to be at home. I coulda done more things without him than I had to do with him. Bobby: My brother Jack, he was an uncompromising character. I actually watched him in a derby match and he gave a goal away and they lost. I said, "you were stupid giving that daft goal away," you know, whatever. And he punched me straight off the back of the couch onto the floor. You know? I don't know if he remembers it. But I remember it alright, yeah. Jack: Use the angle. That's good. Change the angle. Player: Come here, come this way! Man 1: Put the microphone round the other way. That's it. Yeah, so the camera can see it. Yeah. Ok, anytime. Sorry. Man 2: It's alright. Relax. Man 1: Think about your question for us. Victor: Hello, mr charlton. I'd like to ask you a few questions about soccer. What do you think of the english press saying that you're a bunch of mercenaries playing for money because most of you come from england, Scotland or wales? Jack: The players playing for the Republic they don't come for the money. They come because they want to play international football and they've got relatives who were born here in the Republic. And you've always exported people. It's nice for them to come back and help you out now and again. Victor: Ok. How would you describe your coaching and management style? Jack: Very simple and direct. John: My dad made notes. We kept them all. His brain would work quickly. He'd write his thoughts down on a piece of paper. Hundreds of notes on players... Teams... Family... And tactics. Jack: The whole of the rest of the world played exactly the same type of game from the back, play up. They'd been doing that for 25 years. Our way of playing is completely new. Thunder cracks everything was designed. I wanted to apply pressure. Work hard, chase people, close them down. Commentator: That's quickly on. And the goal's scored by Mark lawrenson! Jack: /f you get the ball forward, you compete. You create excitement. Commentator: Byrne again. And it's there! David O'Leary: The risks he took was to play a type of football that the analysts and the critics wouldn't enjoy but the people stopped listening to that when results started to come our way. As you will see if you come to the game. Victor: Man: It's hard for purists to accept that Jack was ahead of his time on this. But today's way of playing, certainly without the ball is exactly how Jack charlton wanted us to play. Jack: And it worked like a charm. We beat Brazil! Commentator: Yes! Jack: Preparation, hard work, and having some good players. Put it all together, and you come up with a team. Victor: Alright, then. Thank you. My pleasure. Thank you. Very good. David: From the day Jack walked in there he had a plan. This is the way you were going to play. If you didn't like it, tough luck. Man: David was regarded as one of the best central defenders in Europe. But he wasn't Jack's type of player. Niall: Dave wasn't picked in the squad and there was a couple of pull-outs and Dave then was picked subsequently but he had booked his holidays and told Jack "sorry, I'm on my holidays." Then Jack said, "right. You don't want to play for me." David: I should have had 7100 caps. He held a grudge. And just the more the topic was raised the more stubborn he got. Man: At this stage, can you say if David O'Leary will be part of the team? I'm sick of repeating this question. Would you think of giving David O'Leary a chance? You're not gonna start picking the team for me by saying, "is David in?" When I need him, I'll call him up. Jack: I've always had a distrust of centre backs who can play. I like centre backs who stop other people playing. Doorbell rings John: It's the postman. Pat: This is for grandad to sign. Here you are. Sign that. Jack: I was invited to west bromwich albion football club this week... Jack: Keep that one. And a fella got up to introduce me. And he said, “ladies and gentlemen Jack charlton left his Mark on players throughout Europe.” I'm keeping that one as well. He said, "he was booked in his career 48 times." He said, "he was sent off the field eight times." He says, “people up and down the country thought he was a good player,” and I brought honour to the game. He said, "we here always thought he was a shit.” Audience laughs Jack: I'm a destroyer, a batterer. A fouler. Audience laughs what're you all clapping for? Audience laughs Jack: I've got a little book with two names in it. If I get a chance to do them, I will. They laugh are you in fact being serious? I'm being serious. Jack: / was tough and I liked to fight. Commentator: Charlton! Break it up, folks. Woman: Jackie charlton seemed to go on forever as a footballer. He's only the third player in history to play in winning teams in the fa cup, the world cup and first division championship. I thought he carried Leeds for a good few years. Commentator: Jack charlton! Bobby: But I didn't want to feather his nest by saying that he was a good player. I never said it, although I always felt it. Commentator: Bobby charlton with the corner. Jack! Crowd cheers commentator: Perfect goal! Jack: He's got a great family life. But he was never the Georgie best type, anyway. Parkinson: No. - He never nightclubbed it and lived it up. He enjoys a drink. But he's a moderate. He's a very moderate. Parkinson: You're very different, aren't you? Audience laughs Jack: /t wouldn't be right for two brothers to be exactly the same. I couldn't possibly be a Bobby charlton and Bobby charlton couldn't possibly be a Jackie. Pat have you done it? Girl: Yeah, he's done it. And he tells me he doesn't smoke! Shut up. Girl: A long time ago. Jack: I like the pace, the competition and the will to win. You become a great player through adversity. My name's Paul mcgrath. Roddy: What a player. A god. Roddy: In the 70s and 80s Ireland was accurately being called a catholic country. The church was very, very powerful. You couldn't get a divorce. There'd been a referendum on abortion and it was rejected. It was very difficult for women who had children out of wedlock. Paul mcgrath: I was a black kid. I would feel that I was on the outskirts. An outsider. My mother was a very beautiful girl. She went to work in London for a doctor and he just took advantage of her. And she had me over there and then had to come back on a boat and pass me over to the nuns. I went to an orphanage till I was 18. I got the shit kicked out of me. If someone calls me a nigga straight to my face then me and him are gonna be fighting. No matter who it is. Declan: He embodied this dysfunctional history of Ireland. There were so few people n Ireland who were black. It was a very draconian country and a very cruel country in a lot of ways and Paul had suffered a lot from that. I just wanted to be as big as I could so that I could not get beaten up as many times as I did. That's what brought me to football. I made friends and that's what I loved about it. Jack: Paul was an exceptional player. Paul was one of those players that any manager in the world would have had in their team. Paul: Jack came in. He wanted me on the team, which was amazing to me. I felt much more confidence in myself. And I didn't want to be killing people. But that was just part of the animal that was in me. Distant crowd shouts commentator: Durie up and battling. That was always on. An advantage is played, good refereeing. And it's come through now to mackay. And it's there! It's there! Gary mackay, as a substitute has put Scotland in the lead! And the Republic of Ireland is off to its first major championship finals. Jack charlton has taken the Irish to Germany '88. This piece of paper which I'd been making up three minutes before the end... It talked about disappointment for Ireland. It gives me great pleasure to do this right now. Audience cheers man: Would you fancy an Ireland versus england final by any chance? Yeah, I'd love it. I'd love to play england at any time, I'd love to play 'em now. And I would fancy us, actually. John: He got his wish. Ireland's first ever tournament and the first match was england. Crowd cheers Jack: Somewhere in the Irish make-up they've got an inbuilt fear of the english. I don't know why. But I do know why. Comedian: An Irish fellow were in the outpatients department and his legs were covered in blisters. They said, "how did you do that?" He says, "it was opening a tin of soup." It says, "stand in boiling water for 10 minutes." Audience laughs Irish man: The stereotype was just... that we were thick. The Irish have just invented a new parachute. Opens on impact. Audience laughs Irish man: Drunken, lazy eegjits. Jack would have been brought up to have no inferiority complex about anyone. Man: He mouths crowd chant: Here we go! Here we go! Female announcer: Now in the group match between england and the Republic of Ireland. Crowd cheers Jack's big ambition was to manage england. You know that? Crowd chant: Ireland! Ireland! John: They said to him, if he applied for the job he'd get the job. He's never had a reply. Des: Bert millichip was the President of the english fa and he said to me, "des... I fear you've made a very grave mistake in appointing charlton. He's not the man for you. Not at all." And I told Jack that. He laughs crowd roars Jack: I could never understand that. It made me feel a little bit bitter about the way nonsense. I've always been interested in how to plan out situations. Commentator: Sansom. Only got a half touch to it. Under a lot of pressure here! Houghton! It's a goal! For the Republic of Ireland! With six minutes gone. Jack: To find out facts to prepare the team properly ! Will travel the length of the earth. Packie bonner: The wind is up. This is it. This is real stuff. I'm from donegal in the northwest. Next up, America. You dictate to us where you want the ball. There was an inferiority complex about us that we hadn't achieved anything at international level. Packie: Stop. Now, think. This was big for our country. Commentator: Lineker, that's a great stop by bonner. Jack: The anxieties of watching your team play you couldn't explain to people. Set! Set! Commentator: Can this be the equaliser for england? No! You're not thinking if you go too quick. Commentator: A great save by bonner! A double save by bonner. Most things don't happen for us in donegal. Commentator:! Packie: All the time, you're watching the game. We had to go and fight for it. Commentator: They've pushed everybody forward. And it's pushed away brilliantly by bonner. What an amazing save! Packie: Emotion is an incredible thing. You remember things for the rest of your life if it's filled with emotion. Whistle blows and england have been beaten by the Republic of Ireland. Jack charlton with a huge embrace. Reporter: Well, Jack charlton a marvellous result for the Republic as a world cup winner with england in '66? Um... no. No mixed feelings at all. Indistinct chatter sorry about that. It's one of them things. Man: Come and sit in here, Bob, if... Des: I'll never forget it, in the vip boardroom after the match in stuttgart. And there were five or six fa officials... Say commiserations. He laughs packie: We played exceptionally well against ussr and then we went out against Holland. But to beat england... That was the moment. Jack: People say that we show an enthusiasm in our game that england don't have. Maybe it's because we know what we're doing. Male host: Are you happy? - Crowd: Yes! Are you ready? - Crowd: Yes! It's Adam, it's bono. It's Larry, it's the edge. It's U2! Crowd cheers I'm Larry mullen. I'm the drummer in U2. ♪ I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more ♪ Larry: We had started to become quite successful. ♪ Say, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more ♪ Larry: We spent a lot of time out of the country so we were catching glimpses of what was happening. Male reporter: Some say it's a tragedy but about 120,000 Irish people have emigrated since 1981. ♪ Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more ♪ Larry: /t was like crabs out of the pot. If you managed to get out, it was a big deal. ♪ No more! ♪ Larry: /t was ripe for something to happen. ♪ No! ♪ It was waiting for something to happen. Crowd cheers Crowd chant: Ireland! Ireland! Larry: Jack changed the whole trajectory. It didn't take a lot for people to gravitate and grab on to this cos it was the only good news. I want to confer on him the status of honorary irishman. Crowd cheers Saint Jack would not be inappropriate but that will take a little while longer. Crowd laughs Declan: The football team with these english and Scottish lads were representing the way Ireland was progressing in just the same way that a band like U2 was. ♪ Who put the ball in the england net? ♪ ♪ I did! I did! ♪ Declan: It became more normal for us to see Irish people doing really well. Jack: It worries me what the reception would be like if we actually won something some day. Crowd laughs Jack: The only rule I ever applied with any players that I've worked with has been common sense. All:! Andy: That was pressure that, frank. Jack: Because whatever you find out about them you've gotta do something about. Have to shower at al coholic's. Frank: Say hello to the lads. - Alright, lads. He laughs Jack: So, the best way was don't look. He's still going. Get off, you pervert. Frank, you've turned up at the worst time in the world for me. This is just before we go to play Spain. I'm a bag of nerves here. Niall: You could touch and feel the spirit of the camp. Bury that before I ram that camera up your arse. Music: "One road" by the wolfe tones ♪ we're on the one road sharing the one load ♪ ♪ We're on the road to god knows where ♪ Niall: He let us go to the pictures. He let us go to the races. He let us go for a few pints. ♪ Dublin, belfast... ♪ Man: Aldo. What are you doing with that, frank? Frank: Go on, Charlie! Charlie O'Leary: If I may tell you a little story... I was called the kit man, we say. Now, a lot of people would say that's the lowest position you can have in an international team. Not where Jack was concerned. Jack made me very, very important. He always put you there with the players. And he never let you down in front of people. He was a master of man-management. I never saw anyone to equal him. Everybody says that england dominated the game and should have won by loads of goals. What a load of crap. Roddy: Jack was blunt, and that was really refreshing. Jack, you're in monaghan today to meet some of the young people in monaghan town. Is it as big a thrill for you as it is for them? No. - No? No, definitely not. I can't stand kids. Roddy: He seemed to enjoy being here. Man: Ok, Jack. Jack: Is this a real team? - All: Yes. Football team, arms folded. Go on, arms folded. Do as your mother says, tighten up. Boys laugh man: Are you talking about financially? Audience laughs Jack: Thank you. Jack: It's... Man best in the world. Jack: Lovely. Trevor o'Rourke: His personality connected with Ireland because of his roots in the north east of england. Working-class people who worked hard for a living. He's actually quite a humorous and very lovable guy. Pat: I'll pinch one of your chips while I'm waiting. This is dunstanburgh castle built in 1313 by the second Earl of Lancaster. After the battle of boroughbridge he was advised to retreat here. But he decided to go south. That's me! Yes. - That's you. He probably preferred that to freezing to death up here cos this is one of the draughtiest holes I've ever been in. That's me. - Jack chuckles I don't even know me doing it. Band plays Jack: I do a lot of television. And if you do something and you feel it's going well... It's enthralling. It's like watching somebody else. Great place. Pat: He was interested. Man: Hello, Jack. - Alright? Pat: He likes to experience things rather than read about it he likes to know how things work. He doesn't do any work but he likes to know how it goes on. I've just been down easington colliery. It's 1,300 feet deep and it stretches the workings for six miles out into the north sea. Jack: The miners went on strike a couple of years ago for more money and they got it, and they deserve it. Anybody that's never been down a mine doesn't really appreciate what it's like working down one. Jack: / see the lads in the club that work in the pit and their life revolves around the club. I think, "would this do for me?" You know. No, I couldn't just go to the pit and go to the club and have a whippet. I would want something more because I've been used to something more. It must be degrees. What you want, what you require out of life. Dr grey: The latest research covered footballers from Jack's era. And it found that players were three to five times more likely to suffer from dementia. The trauma from heading has been linked to decline in brain function. Pat: I didn't want him to know. I just wanted him to think... He's got a bad memory. Pat: Who is it, Jack? - Who? Pat: On there. Pat: I didn't want him to think it's gonna get worse and get worse... Which it will do, unfortunately. Even now we get lovely letters from Ireland. They think a lot of you, don't they, in Ireland? No idea. Dr grey: People with dementia know that there's a problem. And when they say they don't know typically that's with a fair bit of remorse. Pat: You don't know how much they take in. If you said to him, "Geoff hurst" he'd look and go, "who?" But if we met Geoff, he'd know him. Football match plays over laptop Jack: Paul mcgrath. Jack: His great problem was alcohol. We used to fly in to Dublin and we would take him, put him in his room ask him what he wanted to eat and then somebody would sleep across the front door of his bedroom so that he couldn't get out. Paul mcgrath: I could actually have a drink... And still try and play. And a couple then used to turn into you can't tie your own boot laces going out on a football pitch or you have to have a drink from the physio. Jack: He didn't turn up one day. Take that out my face. Been in contact with Jack? - No. Jack: Later that night, I got a phone call, and it was Paul. Do you think that this will ruin your future international prospects, Paul? I hope not. Jack: He says, "well, I was with a friend and we went down to cork and we got on the first plane we could get onto and it went to Israel.” Will you be back for the next two games, Paul? Who knows? Jack: He said, "can I come back?" I said, "of course you can come back but you're not gonna play." It was typical Paul. Man: 1973 marked the end of the playing career of the charlton brothers. Jack moved into management with middlesbrough. And on the same day, Bobby became manager of Preston. Coach shouts come on, Jimmy. You'll catch him if you rush. Jack: I've stayed very much a player's man. I train with them. I get involved in the games of cricket in the dressing room. They jeer pat: Jack's always been outgoing. They jeer pat: But where Bob is a much quieter character you've got to get to know him... You're Jack's friend straightaway. Man 1: Looking ahead to Saturday Jack charlton and Bobby charlton are meeting for the first time as managers. The game has been billed as "the charlton war". Man 2: I've asked for Jackie and Bobby to come along. Jack: There's no war between me and our kid. There's no war. What do you want to do? I think it's dangerous. As far as entertainment value, you're not gonna get any. It's a lottery. It's not a match. Jack: / always wanted to go into management. I'm not sure that our kid was prepared properly for what it was like to make the decisions. Man laughs Bobby: Have you got a licence for them? Course I have. Jack: They want hanging for a week. You can do anything with 'em. Leave that hanging as well. Alright. Well, I'll see, anyway. See you, Robert. See you soon. - Ta-ta, John! Niall: Bobby charlton is a huge shadow to have around you if you're a brother of his trying to play football or manage. He had to have a big character to overcome that and Jack had that character. Fans shout They cheer Jack: We all want to play in world cups. You don't get a chance to play in many. Crowd cheers commentator: Ireland have finally qualified for the world cup finals. An historic afternoon in Malta. The party can now begin. And Jack charlton is now joining Jimmy magee on the touchline. Jimmy laughs Jack: / don't think anybody expected very much of us. They laugh Jack: As long as we did enough to please the people back here we would be ok. Well done! People applaud Reporter speaks Italian what is this? A bloody lawnmower convention or what? Man: Now, what about england's first opponents the Republic of Ireland? Woman: It's estimated that there will be 10,000 Irish supporters in cagliari against england. This is the time when it gives you the opportunity now... You need to go. Come on. Crowd chant: Ireland! Ireland! Jack: The fear has gone out of the Irish football team certainly, in playing the english. Commentator: And lineker's sneaking in. A chance for england here! Is it going in? It is! Jack: /'d want england to beat everybody else in the world but I didn't want them to beat us. Commentator: And he's in here. And he's equalised! Kevin sheedy! Jack: And england never did manage to beat us. ♪ Ole, ole, ole, ole! ♪ Jack: That was when the excitement started to happen. Yeah! Trevor: I remember Jack talking about the importance of the fans to the whole set-up. Raaaaw! Trevor: The point being you are the best fans in the world. You'll miss the party in Dublin tonight. All: One, two, three four, five, six seven, eight, nine... Jack: The Irish sing, dance and entertain. All: Four, five, six, seven... Jack: Wherever we go, there's never one minute's trouble. Crowd cheers they were having it. Larry: People were selling their houses giving up work, doing crazy things to make sure that they could be there for those moments. Nice to see you. All the best. Crowd cheers we're gonna go through the next stage and gonna win the world cup! My name is eamon Dunphy. Crikey. What did Jack think of Dunphy? Um... Can I swear or not? Eamon: I became a national hate figure at that moment for critical analysis on television of Jack. Commentator: Terrific prospects for a marvellous game and a victory, of course, for the Republic of Ireland will almost certainly put them through to the second phase. They cheer bell rings Jack: / absolutely hate playing teams like that. It was a terrible anticlimax. Football is a two-sided game. When you haven't got the ball, when you have got the ball. When we have got the ball, we are cowardly. Eamonn: /t was charlton-style football at its worst. Commentator: The final whistle. The Egyptians raise their arms in delight. This is a great footballing country. We've produced players, and go out and play that rubbish. He scoffs what was transmitted to the people in Italy was that I'd said I was ashamed to be Irish. Jack: Got a report back that eamon Dunphy on the television who is about as much relevance to us as a fly on the window sill. Apparently, Dunphy asked a question. And he said, "no, you can't." And he said, “I'm not talking to you. You're not a proper journalist." Jack, on tape: He said, "if you don't get out, I'm going." Roddy: Jack charlton was wrong not to allow himself be interviewed in a room with eamon Dunphy I mean, as if the man was a leper. And that was just silly and boorish. The country was so enthralled with Jack that even the barest sign of criticism was totally unacceptable. I'm just the one that has decided that I'm not going to be bullied any longer. And I don't think Jack and I ever spoke after that. I am entitled as an individual to speak to who I want to speak to. And I don't want to talk to him. Andy: A few times over the years I knocked on his door as a captain to speak about a couple of things. Each time, wasn't interested. "I'm not interested in what you think." Sometimes you feel that he should listen. It was always ruled out, pretty much instantly. Jack: What!'D learnt from Don revie at Leeds was that you've got to make up your mind what you like... And then you've got to be dogmatic and stick with it. ♪ Ole, ole, ole, ole! ♪ Andy: Next game, we played Holland. We qualified with a goal that was as direct as anything I think we'd ever scored. Commentator: And that was Van aerle. And Van breukelen has lost it! And it's there! Niall Quinn has got it! Crowd cheers commentator: A magnificent performance in palermo and Ireland are in the next phase. Jack: We've produced a team that the Irish can be proud of and that they like to watch.

My god. ♪ Ole, ole, ole, ole! ♪ Roddy: The whole country had stopped. There was something almost magical occurring. And visually, the most impressive thing was the colour. Larry: The big thing in Ireland was the tricolour and what that meant and had been taken by the violent republican movement... And it was their flag. And that changed in 1990. We took that flag back and flew it with pride. Jack charlton did that. John: This is where we're going fishing. Have you ever been here before? Jack: No, I've never fished here before but I've fished below it. John: Right. Larry: Did Jack have any idea? John: Which one do you think? Larry: Could it have been anybody else?

Crowd screams Commentator: Jack charlton doesn't know whether to smile or not. Jack: / was frightened to death when I saw David O'Leary come up to take the fifth penalty. David: / was absolutely shocked when I was told I was going on against Romania. Jack: I'm sick of repeating this question. When I need him, I'll call him up. Jack: The moment I did need him, I called him up. David: It was a long three years. I missed about 50 internationals in that period of time. /'d taken no penalties before in my career. There were so many Irish supporters and... Then it just went still behind there. Audio dims it was just so quiet. John: Do you wanna sit on this rock and cast out there? Jack: Alright. Jack: I don't like the word “adulation”. John: Well done, good cast. Jack: / like to think of the Irish as friends of mine. /'d no real idea how it would build up. Woman: But what does it do to you, this adulation? What did it make you feel? Jack: They... Jack: I don't know. I don't know. Grateful. David: Don't mess it up. Commentator: This kick can decide it all. And then all hell broke loose, didn't it? Commentator: The nation holds its breath. Yes! Crowd roars crowd screams They scream ♪ Ole, ole, ole, ole! ♪ David: Jack came up to me in the dressing room afterwards... And shook my hand and went "I knew you wouldn't miss," and walked on. Nothing else, I remember those words exactly. "I knew you wouldn't miss." And that's what he said. Woman: There's another bit of analysis of Jack charlton that comes into play here which is that it was the first time you'd stepped out from behind the shadow of your younger brother that you achieved something that he never did. Jack: Not really. I like playing football but it wasn't the be-all and end-all of my life. Maybe if we'd had something in common, like problems of being a manager over a period of 20-odd years maybe we would have been better friends. Des: Well, now Bobby charlton's joined us. Bobby's always nervous on england occasions. What do you make of the team changes, Bob? Well, england have a strong squad, des and I'm not displeased with any of the substitutes. Niall: I didn't see a lot of them together. There'd be something on the TV and Jack would make a comment as if, "Bobby doesn't know that. He's wrong." There certainly wasn't a pouring of affection for his brother. John: After the win against Romania Bobby came to see my dad at the hotel and then they did an interview for the television. Bobby: Well, I'm very... I'm reluctant to say this really, for fear of embarrassing him but I'm very proud, really. The greatest thing for us certainly from our Jack's point of view is going to happen over this next week. Who knows where the whole thing will stop? The biggest adventure is yet to come. Fantastic. That's what it is, fantastic. That must have been one of the happiest days they've ever had together, given what was coming. And, you know... That's... that's about all you can say. People cheer and shout Bobby: / was talking to somebody from Ireland the other day. And they said that the Irish they always had two people over the mantlepiece: John F. Kennedy and the pope. But there's a few going up of Jack charlton as well now. People clamour niall: Others, maybe their teams would be having ice baths and recovering, watching videos but we were in St. Peter's basilica with the pope. Audience applauds pope: Audience applauds Charlie: The world saw Jack charlton the pope and Charlie O'Leary. It's a treasure. I'm afraid to say too much in case people think I'm boastful. But one or two women was coming and saying “do you mind if I put my arm on your shoulder? Is that where the pope held it?" Do you know what I mean? I was lucky it didn't go any further but it only went as far as my shoulder, like. Jack: The guy said, "and this is mr charlton.” And the pope turned around, looked at me and he went, "yes." And he said... "The boss.” He wished us luck from the dais with a little smile. When he was sat in his chair and he looked down at me and he sort of went, "good luck." Man laughs Jack: When I came in to them in the dressing room before the game, I said “there's nothing there to be frightened of. We've got as many people in the stadium as they have." And I can smell it. Commentator speaks Italian Jack: The goal came as a surprise. Commentator speaks Italian Jack: And we went out with that goal. Niall: We were so flat and so low.

It was my mam that brought me, my brother and sister up. Pat: There's some big rolls coming in there, isn't there? Big stuff. Pat laughs John: They met at a dance. He told her he was Jack charlton and he played for Leeds united. And she said she was Doris day and she was a film actress. Pat laughs hello, sir. - Jack: Hello. Man: How are you? - Jack: I'm fine. John: If it wasn't for her he wouldn't have been as successful as he has been. It's like being in Spain. She laughs Jack: Football was always a means of escape from ashington. When lads that had left ashington had gone away to play football if they didn't succeed and had to come back it was like a disgrace. They'd failed. I didn't want to go away and fail. Crowd chants: We want Jack! We want Jack! Woman: You want Jack? Crowd cheers female reporter: Dublin had never seen anything like it. Woman: It's the most colourful, noisy and joyful scene the city has ever seen. It's a spectacular sight. Roddy: I've never been present at the end of a war but it did have that feel of liberation. It was just electrifying. Male reporter: And I'm sure that Jack charlton and the rest of the team have never ever experienced anything quite like this. Roddy: There was a shift, definitely. A way of perceiving ourselves that had changed. The Republic's first woman president Mary Robinson, is here. Roddy: And that was part of the shift the fact that she was a woman and she was a liberal. Mary: I put forward an idea of the elected president of Ireland being different which could represent an Ireland that's underestimated an Ireland that was part of the vitality and energy that was there in Italy during the world cup. Bertie: The tide had turned. People saw economic and social progress. Employment was rising. Emigration had almost ceased. Jack: Thank you. Brendan o'carroll: We just grew up. We just got a sense of self-respect. A sense of pride. Politically, economically we had won the right to take our place as a nation. The next one, you're gonna love.

I was going to the other side the darker side, where... I'm just wanting out. I'm just wanting out of... Everything. Announcer over tannoy arriving at lansdowne. Paul: I was having a tough time. Jack came down the bus. I just said, “I'm getting the dts." It's something that happens with alcoholics. Your brain's not functioning right. Jack said, "if you don't get off the bus today you'll never play for this country again." And I said, "yeah, Jack, I understand, I do understand." I just couldn't get off the bus. I haven't got time to do all these. Jack: I do worry about Paul. It's like I've said to him many times people in football will look after you. It's in their interest to look after you. When it's not in their interest, they won't. Paul: We won the game, thank god. And Jack came down to my room. And I was sitting under the bed and I was shivering and shaking. He put his arm on my shoulder and he just said “sorry, son. I didn't realise how bad you had it." And then he just pulled up the blankets back over my shoulders and headed out. He stuck with me again. Jack: Thank you for inviting me. What you've done with the football ground is tremendous. [I love that. I like it when I'm driving through Ireland and I see football fields with proper goals. Audience laughs Jack: Hello. - Hello, Jack. Brendan: Jack did an awful lot for soccer in this country. Jack: Remember two things when you're playing football. You must control what comes to you and be able to hit what you can see. Brendan: He popularised it all around rural Ireland where it hadn't been popular. Jack: Kick it to me. Not at him, at me. You've gotta learn to kick it to me. K-I-s-s. "Keep it simple, stupid”. Do the complicated things simply. Or a little back-heel to that lady there. Kids laugh Jack: Control it and kick it between each other. Go on, and you lot. Man: What we were really good at were the boy bands and the riverdance Michael flatley and Brendan o'carroll. Am I good? Boys - Parents laugh the only reason I'm good is cos I've had loads and loads of practice. Man: People who were populist. Girl: You alright? - I'm fine. How are you? Man: You could actually be successful just being yourself. Jack: Now hit me! Come on! Rubbish! Over there. Brendan: To be authentic for the first time in your life... To be allowed to be authentic... It's an amazing freedom. Jack did the same thing. Do it again. Brendan: Kept it simple. Anywhere, just throw it up. There, there Alright? - Hi, fine. Pat: That way. We'll go see pat. Careful, careful, careful. Man: Are you coming in? Jack: Come on, Jackie lad. Jack! Pat: Get up near the front. Man: Right, everybody outside, please! Dr grey: Dementia is very difficult for the carers and family members as they watch a person change... Someone whom you love changing in front of your eyes. Learning how to deal with what seems like a different person. Pat: You need two hands for this. Pat: He's got more emotional as he's got older... Because he can't do what he wants to do. All his life he was an outdoor man. Man: How many fish was there today, George? Four? Right, what have we got here, young fella? Pat: He gets a bit emotional, I think. Thanks, Jackie! Looks good on you. What? - Looks good on you. They laugh dr grey: There's a real courage that is shown by people with dementia. Man: The Jack charlton cumbria and northumbrian trout cup. Dr grey: Not knowing where one is not knowing who's speaking to you but they're not blank... They're emotionally suffering. Indistinct chattering thank you very much. Dr grey: One of the reasons that dementia is such a terrible disorder is that memory defines who we are. Where are we going? Dr grey: There will be flashes of brilliance but as the disease progresses those flashes become less and less frequent. Man: Thank you very much. - Ok. Explosion reporter: From a bomb in a fish shop on the shankill road to the greysteel attack eight days in which 23 people have died. Get out the way. Jack: The tension that we felt about going up to belfast was nothing compared to what we felt when we got to belfast. Niall: We had an armoured car in front of us and an armoured car behind us as our bus made its way through. We passed a bank. There was these kids. They didn't have rifles but they were all like that, boom! And they all went down on one knee and another group stood up behind them and boom! It was all choreographed. I'd say the eldest child was about 12. Fans chant Jack: / never imagined the emotions and the feelings that were stirred up in the ground. Fans chant Jack: It was nasty. It was unhealthy. Andy: They didn't play our anthem. We had no fans in the stadium. And we knew if we lost, we were out. Jack: The lads, I felt, rushed things. And then all of a sudden, we go a goal down. Commentator: Kevin Wilson. Quinn. It's there! Jimmy Quinn has done it! Jack: A spectacular out-of-this-world goal that was totally against the run of play at the time. I had three subs on the bench. And I looked at Alan mcloughlin, and I said, "Alan, you. Do what you're good at.” Commentator: Comes straight out to mcloughlin. It's there! Alan mcloughlin has done it! Jack: Well, I considered it a stroke of genius, actually. Jack laughs commentator: Has he blown the whistle? Yes, he has! It's all over, and the Republic celebrate. They will qualify. What a night of drama. Get in there! Fucking hell! Get in there! Come on! Niall: The night we played northern Ireland football won over the pain that had been inflicted on people for so long. The game took place, and Ireland was the better for it. Sport was helping to find a way out of it. He coughs man: I think we all have, Jack. Jack: / didn't leap all over the place, didn't kiss the lads. I went in the dressing room and said "well done, lads. Great. Delighted for you." I didn't feel elated. Bertie: People were tired of the violence the killing, the murder, the mayhem. The image of the country was changing and the soccer team were reflecting that very well. People applaud - Jack: Hello. John: He was aware of the bigger picture. What are you clapping for? Are you gonna give me a smile? He used to try and play it all down. Brian, are you in this picture? John: He thought that that was the best way you could get people to listen. Jack: There you go. - Woman: Stand there, Jack. Irish mammies, when she says "stand there", you stand there. Man: Do the Irish in britain love Jack charlton? Yes, absolutely. - Yes. Better than Margaret Thatcher. People cheer niall: Jack, being a man of all people, of all persuasions he played his part in the peace process. Crowd applauds Jack showed that you can be english and you can be loved in Ireland. Wey! We'll see you all in Boston. Niall: He opened a little window of opportunity. Great political leaders could come in then and bring the men of violence nto the same mould. Oi, oi! - People cheer that's what it means. I'm telling you, that's what it means. People cheer Bobby: We had won the world cup in 1966 and the council in ashington decided that they would honour us by having a civic reception. The proudest moment that any of us have ever had. Jack: The whole street was crammed with people. Kids on top of the roofs. Bunting right across as far as you could see. They really went to town on it. John: The sad part about it I haven't seen my uncle Bobby for a long, long time. And it's a shame, but... We all live different lives now. Girl: Grandad. Can I have a sweet? - A sweet? She giggles Jack: / don't think you can ever forget your background. You can't leave it. It's always stayed with me. Bobby did what Bobby wants to do. From being very much a homeboy apple of his mother's eye suddenly he just stopped going home. I don't know why. You've either done the meat too much or you haven't sharpened the knife, one of the two cos it's hackin' it. Jack: /t was strange to me. I couldn't understand. Woman: And has that damaged your relationship with him? Jack: I think so. I think so. Woman: How deeply damaged? Jack: Only time will tell. John: They've both been guilty of... Not saying or doing the right thing. Man shouts indistinctly John: Your life's too short to be falling out. It's his brother, it's our kid. We'd all like a happy ending. Whether that happens or not... It's down to, I suppose, two stubborn people. So, I originally moved out here to... Look at the possibility of taking up professional golf. This is a par five here. I've... I've actually done it in three but it's a difficult hole, you have to watch yourself. No better place to find the Irish than in the Irish pub here in New York. Now, with me I have a few dubs and one or two from kildare. One or two! - They jeer it was in 1994 for the world cup that I came out here and I fell in love with the place. And now I live here. Brendan whistles I'll stand up for a second cos this bench is fuckin' hot. Reporter: This weekend in New York City the two biggest immigrant communities the /talians and the Irish have divided this city's loyalty. Brendan: We were all told, "New York, that's the [talians." We took over the place. Crowd cheers ♪ Ooh, aah, Paul mcgrath ooh, aah, Paul mcgrath ♪ Man: Italy are gonna take an awful lot of beating. They've got a very, very strong defence. And in Roberto baggio they have the most potent striker of the whole tournament. Jack: And we used to say, "Paul... When we line up to kick off smile at the centre forward. Don't say anything. Don't do anything. Just... smile at him." Paul: Giants stadium. It was scary. But it was brilliant. Commentator: Knocked down by houghton, goes for the shot! Goal! Ray houghton! Andy: We all played well. But there was one that was... Unbelievable. Commentator: Here's signori against mcgrath. And mcgrath up there ahead of him. Jack: We know Paul had his problems but we looked after him. Nobody knew about his problems. Commentator: In goes Roberto baggio mcgrath's head got there. Jack: Nobody knew. Paul: Jack wanted the best for me. He understood... That I loved him. Anytime he put me on a football pitch and I was in any way healthy /'d be playing for him as much as anyone. Commentator: Again, it's mcgrath. And once more, Paul mcgrath, the man to the rescue. Jack: Paul mcgrath is a great, great player. We like to play with the great, great players. We needed him. Commentator: Seconds that seem like minutes to the Irish. In goes betti, it's mcgrath once more! Paul: I felt... Unbreakable. Commentator: History has been made! Another magnificent chapter in Jack charlton's managerial career but a monumental performance from Paul mcgrath. Brendan: Jack's relationship with Paul was very private... And very fatherly. What made Paul the love of the Irish fans he represents all of us. We're flawed. We're all flawed. Paul: I don't really value myself the way other people seem to. But that time with Jack charlton defined my life... Simply because it needed defining. Male reporter: In the sunshine state of Florida Jack charlton is an angry man. Jack: We knew we were going to be put under scrutiny and I warned those lads out there not to breathe in front of any of you lot. And you've caused that. Andy: England didn't qualify. I don't think he liked all the focus being on him and being on us. And anything I say to you is prejudging. Get that out the way. Commentator: Incredible conditions for these players here in the citrus bowl. There's the temperature. Look at that. Rolled in for hermosillo. Garcia! Man: We had two games in Florida. The style of play bashing the ball up the field you just couldn't do it in the heat. Fuck off, you! Fuck off! You twat! You dickhead! Commentator: Driving forward, he'll unleash a shot this time. And bonner makes a hash of it. And the Irish world cup dream is over. Jack: My greatest fear is that 1'll fall out with the Irish that they might not like me anymore. And once that attitude changes I'll be on my way before I fall out. Man: We played england in a friendly. Fans chant ♪ no surrender, no surrender ♪ ♪ No surrender to the ira! ♪ Hooligans tore all the seats up and ran amok, as it were. It's alright. Get Jack charlton there. Get away and fuck off! Go on! Back into your hole! Go home! Go home! I felt like crying at the end of the game. Every englishman should be ashamed of what went on there tonight. Andy: The innocence had gone. Things were gonna need to start to move on in some way. And change wasn't something he was good at. It's been a great, eventful ten years, Jack when you've been at the helm. Don't start asking me what I'm doing. No, no, no. Don't you start asking that again. No, you're not asking. Whistle blows a blast on the whistle and Holland go through and Ireland go out. Jack: 1'll know when it's time. 1'll know when it's time. Woman: Jack charlton has resigned. Man 1: Charlton asked the five-man committee did they want him to resign? And they all responded "yes". Man 2 it was a rather shambolic end to a glorious decade in Irish football including two world cups and a memorable European championships in 1988. Jack: I feel a lot lighter now. And I don't know... I'm gonna have to live with it to find out if I regret it. We've had some great days and great nights and good memories. I hope that the people of Ireland have got... I know that they've got the memories.

There's Mother Teresa and then there's him. Pat: And me, if you don't mind. Sorry! - Pat laughs pat: Well, the reason I think he's not been given a knighthood was because he never has been a "yes" man. And if he's upset anybody, well... Tough. Bobby's is there, yeah.
