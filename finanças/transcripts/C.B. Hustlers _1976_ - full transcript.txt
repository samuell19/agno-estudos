- That's a 10-four. (upbeat funk music) Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me if he passed me when we started up the same hill up there. - I'm telling, I had to get here. But you when you get up there, give me a whistle, all right? (static hissing) - Standby, breaker breaker. - Yeah, head on out. Stay on till you get to the southbound lane. Go around there. (static hissing) - One more time. - I wasn't talking to you. - Your mic's coming in pretty clear. - Too close or too far away. - Pretty good. - Jump up on down. Probably the guy that called the cows- - Ah, this is Honey Bun, I need a copy of- (static hissing) - Roger, Honey Bun, we got Moonshine here. - 10-four.

Think we can get his heart started? - Uh-uh. Hey, what's the five letter word for currency? - Money, which Moonshine has but we are going to get it.

Ready to work. - Sounds far out. - Got Lemon, skin tight and pure. - Sounds real good to me. (funky music) - The one selling senior, got a juicy watermelon. - Juicy, oh!

Whether, where are you from? - Over there in the next county. - Hm, yeah. This, uh, here, your vehicle? - Belongs in the family. - Hm. What you got in the bag? - Just some old baggage and camp gear. - Oh, you do? You mind if I have a look in there. - Yes, I do. - Well, (chuckling) we have the search laws, right? - Hmm. - Well, tell you there ain't no collar, lucky for you this time I guess, but I want you to know that this here is a clean county. Sheriff Ramsey here aims to keep it that way, all right? - Yes, sir, we'll be good. Bye, sir. (phone ringing) - Morning, Clarion Weekly. Huh? Yeah, we go to press in about five hours. Okay, bye now. Hey, Mountain. Or Mr. Dean. Mountain Dean. Oh, boy. One of these days- - No one will do it. (static hissing) - CB break, east-bound 18-wheeler, Smokey the Bear coming a mile behind it. - What the hell is Smokey the Bear? - Cops! Don't you ever listen to that thing? - I don't know what that thing is though. - Two, this is Hotbox One, do you read? (static hissing) - Honey, tell her to get her act together. - Hotbox Two, that's you, Double Dee? Give me two words that mean shut up. - That's enough. - Right.

Damn Smokey! By the time we find a good location and set up shop, those four-wheelers come rolling by and bust it up. - Ah, that goes with the territory. - Well, I don't mind telling you, I'm getting a little sick and tired of the road life. - What are you talking about? I think road life has been great to us. Where else could you got out and travel the country, and make the money we make. We own all these vans, clean and clear. We don't even pay no taxes. - Yeah, well, I'll tell you. If someone were to make me an offer right now, the vans, the girls, the CB units, 2500 a week, I'd chuck it all. - And me? - I couldn't leave you, honey. You're my right arm. - But what would we do, then? - Well, I don't know. Buy a farm, maybe. Settle down. Just be folks. (percussive music) (men shouting) (all chattering) (man laughing) (all chattering) (laughing) (all chattering) (laughing) (all cheering) - I love you. - God, I hope he's not driving. (upbeat funk music) - I don't get 'em, think they got me fooled. Well, they gotta get up a lot earlier to fool Sheriff Elrod P. Ramsey. Yes, sir, that smarty hotshots had better watch it. All that hanky-panky beer drinking, that is someone smoking that funny boy stuff. Namby-pamby lawlessness. What I'm gonna get is evidence. Then I'll ride them out of my county, yeah! And I got just the way to get it. Super undercover disguise is the way to bust up those gangs. Join 'em and ram 'em. (laughing) They won't even know what hit 'em, (funky music) - Haven't met anybody like you in my entire life. (laughing) (all yelling) - Who was that twerp? - A guy. - I know it's a guy, but who was he? - Oh, just someone I used to hang with. - You went with that gas junkie. - He happens to be a super guy. - I bet. How the mighty have fallen. - You can say that again. (all chattering) (all chattering) (laughing) (man cheering) - Whoo! (all chattering) - Well, looks like everybody is having a good time. - Damn! Wish I thought to bring my camera. - Listen, flash! This rally is going to be here for three days. You can take a picture anytime. We are frying bigger fish today. Now go out and mingle with the people. - But I don't wanna mingle. - Mingle or I'll mangle. (funky music) (all chattering) (laughing) (all chattering) - Looks better upside down. (all laughing) (all chattering) - Hi, mister. - Well, hello there, little lady. Quite a sight, huh? (man hoots) - What you doing, Mr. Boots? - Well, taking them notes, get- (man yelling) We are doing an article on CB vans. - Would you like to see the inside of a real moving van with a great receiver? - I don't know. - Oh, come on, Mr. Boots. - Okay. Lead on, little lady. (upbeat funk music) - Well, now Mr. Turner. How long have you had this CB business? - Well, I had this particular rig, two years now. - Oh! You have always owned vans then? - Oh, no, we've had pick ups, stretch outs, buses, anything that holds more than two people. We got a big family, you know. - Very interesting. And you give your rigs names? - Of course. - What do you call this van? - Oh, hot- - Hot- Hotel. - Why is that? - Oh, because we've got girls checking in and out all the time. (all laughing) - Really? (all chattering) - This looks like a van, another van that I've seen lately. - They all kinda look alike This is mighty nice of you, young lady. - Well, you might have a chance to talk to her again. (chuckles) You are kinda cute for a good man. - And you have a CB, of course? - Of course. - What's your handle? - My what? - Your CB code name. - Uh, uh, darling. - That figures. - That's very interesting. - Hey, mister, how come you ain't taking no notes? (man laughing) - I have a photogenic memory. - Are you good all over? - I'm wearing leather boots. - You want to go now? Well tell me something. Are you married? - Uh-uh. - Well, folks, I think I have got enough information for a first class feature. And I want to thank you for your first class co-operation. - We wanna thank you, Mr. Dean. We hope we gave you everything you wanted. - (chuckles) To be sure. To be sure. Well, see ya in the funny papers. - You sure got a mighty powerful chest, Boots. - I used to milk cows when I was a boy. - Your ears are so cute, they taste salty. - I used to shovel manure. - What's more exciting than my company? - Boots! If you don't come out here, I'm gonna leave without you. - Sir, excuse me, have you seen Boots? Oh, you can't miss him. Come on, he's so high, about so wide, and his eyes have a totally blank look in 'em. (all chattering) - Boots! - Boots, now push. (grunting) - Sure would like to do some turn around. - Oh! I'm sorry, Rocky, they are all down junking today, stick it in your ear. Come on, Boots, all together now, push! (both grunting) - Ah! Damn I think I just seen me a tongue. - When is the last time you laid some track, big boy? - Oh, it's been a long time. (chuckling) - Whoa, wait a minute, hotshot. Got 25 bucks? - Uh-uh. - Hand it over. - What's $25 for? - Total charge. (both laughing) (all chattering) - Keep the pace, baby. High and feeble. Make love, not war. - They are so dumb. I'm a new person, they think I'm one of them. As easy as taking candy from a baby. (funky music) - Hey, the same van I stopped. Wonder what they are doing here. Probably more hanky-panky. Well, I'll put a stop to that. (funky music) - Day off, Sheriff? - Boots? - Hm. - Make love to me. - Hmm, show your nipples. (moaning) (static hissing) - Dancer, this is Moonshine, do you copy? - Hi, Moonshine, how is it hanging? - It's trouble, old buddy. It ain't hanging, it's draining. Me and Black Eagle were looking for a pop. Silky gives us weird vibe. - Can't tell he was was Van Johnson or- - I'm here at the rally, boys. I'll check it out, anyways. - Dancer's voice. But that's Turner! Where the hell is Boots? (laughing) - Ooh, wow! - Why you dirty old man, you should be ashamed of yourself! Shame, shame, shame. - Oh, my God. - Hi, mom. - Oh, no, Miss Turner, I didn't realize it was your daughter. I swear I didn't. - I bet. - No, honestly, she, she looked so different. She was all grown. She had, and everything. - Well, she is quite developed for a 16 year old, ain't you, darling? - Yes, mommy. He gave me $25 too. - Mr. Clayborn, sir, will you please put your clothes on in front of my child. - Yes, ma'am, right away, ma'am. And I want you to step outside here. I don't wanna dirty this van with the likes of you. - Yes, ma'am. - Mr. Clayborn, sir, are you aware what the charges are in this state for statutory rape? - Statue, what ma'am? - Laying a teenybopper, you twit. It's 30 years, hard time. - I didn't know she was a child, I swear I didn't. - God bless you, you have deflowered my child. - If I could take it back, ma'am, I would. - Oh, no, what's important here is, to save my child's honor and reputation. Wouldn't you agree, sir? - Oh, yes, ma'am. - Oh, good, then I'm glad we agreed. This is exactly what we do. Mr. Clayborn, I'll drop all those charges against you. In return, you must promise never to mention this incident to anyone. Is that clear? - Oh, no ma'am, I swear I won't breathe a word to a living soul. - Not to Mr. Dean, or to Mrs. Saggins or anybody, or else you'll be a goner! - And I have $25 to prove it. - No, may I be dipped in born and mule fat if I whisper a word. Can I go now? - Mr. Clayborn, if I were you, I'd go straight to church and pray for my salvation. - Yes, ma'am, I will, I will right away. - Was she any good? - Ma'am? - Goodbye, Mr. Clayborn. - Yes, ma'am. - Bye! Come back, you here? (static hissing) - Dancer, this is Hogbreath, do you copy? - Yeah, Hogbreath, this is Dancer. What's up? - Couple of us old boys are heading your way. Wanted to lay some tracks. The way I heard it, is your Annies have taken over them four wheelers and leave the 18 wheelers with their dipsticks in their hands. - (laughing) I know the problem, man. - Yeah, go take care of them right away. I thought your Annies were our private stock. - They are, Hogbreath. They've been on knocking on some of that amateur stuff while they are here at the rally. I'll take care of it. Don't you worry. Harry is in the all new, Franco Matania career. - Solid, old buddy. See you soon. - Hotbox Two, this is Dancer, do you copy? (static hissing) Hotbox Two, this is Dancer, do you copy? (static hissing) Where are those skanky things? - Hello, Clyde? Is Boots over there? No, we got separated at that van rally, and I thought maybe he might have come back into town for a bite to eat. Okay, if he comes in, have him call me, will ya? Thanks.

But all that ever seems to interest you is who attended the last church social, or to remind our readers that their dogs have to be relicensed. You listen to that trucker CB talk, you might pick up on a hot news item. - Oh, come off it, Mountain, you had your ear to that box for five years now. And all they ever told you was lettuce was going 75 cents a bushel. - Hm, I made us some money, didn't I? Off that brand new linotype. So what the hell are you bitching about? - I ain't bitching, but don't sit there playing Dick Tracy, and tell me that CB radio is gonna give us the story of the year. - That's the difference. That is the difference between you and me. It is the difference between dog licenses and detente. It is the difference between church socials and Watergate. It is the difference between talking to Eric Sevareid and Boots Clayborn. It is the difference between little and big. It is the difference between the local PTA's annual journalism award, and the Pulitzer prize. It is the difference between night and day. Between black and white. Between...

To be trapped in this one horse town, with a bunch of meat, oh God. - Dear Ma'am. No, that doesn't sound good. - This is Hogbreath, just passed your rig. Looking for a huge watermelon, got a load I wanna drop, over. - Morning Hogbreath, this is Scuzz, You know Sunday, it's down the road, and Lemon will be ready to unload, do you copy? I gotta write to my mother. (phone ringing) - Clarion Weekly, Boots Clayborn. Oh, hi, Miss Saggins, how are you? Yeah, how is Wilbur? Fine, fine. Oh, yeah, just a minute. Okay. Last night? Yeah, how much did she weigh? 22 pounds! Oh, ah, that much Okay, oh, yes ma'am, yes ma'am. I getting it all down. You can read about in paper next week. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, yeah. Tell Wilbur, hello for me. Fine day to you too, Miss Saggins. Bye now. - Stop the presses. Copy point, re-write. Rewrite! I just got a hot flash. I want this in three inch type with red banner. Okay, here goes. Mrs. Wilbur J. Suggins' pet cow Bula just dropped a calf. The new arrival weighed in at 22 pounds. Both mother and daughter are doing fine. Signed, 30! - How did you know that? - Oh, command is a lonely- - Got a buyer on the way, so polish up those lemons. - What's a lemon? - Just watch my action, silky. I'm gonna rape old Hogbreath in record time. I'm gonna cook his ass. - Hi, Dee Dee, honey. Your boy has missed ya. - How much of that panda piss have you had all, old buddy? - Oh, just a nip and a tuck, darling. - I don't like taking on no drunks. - Yeah, they take too long. - Wait, but I can handle him. - I can handle my own action. - I'm gonna improve on my record. - He's all yours, Dee Dee. - Come on you, let's get cracking. - Oh! What a beautiful day! Just took me a nice long walk, cleared my head. Ah, that sun sure feels good. - Change your mind about retiring? - Nope. Still think it's a good idea. You ought to get some thought about putting down some roots somewhere. You ain't getting any younger. - Oh hell, we got miles to go before we call it quits. - I ain't talking about calling it quits. Just getting tired of dodging the law, pissing on the run and eating out of cans. Damn, woman, when was the last time we slept in a decent bed? Or had us a steak dinner? - I can't recall. - That's what I mean. - Wait, my hair. Take my pants off. Sorry. - I've I'd known you looked this good, I'd have been here sooner. - See. - When you're done, I'll go. Oh! - You ready? - Oh, I'm ready, honey. I'm on, I'm ready. - Okay. (moaning) (upbeat funk music) - You hungry? - A little. You? - Oh God, I'm starving. - Huh? You ate the whole pound of those peanuts. How could you be hungry? - I quit smoking last month. - And you gained 30 pounds too. - Oh, come on, I'm starving. Let's go over to Clyde's Steaks. - All right. - Hotbox One, this is Hotbox Two. What' the hell's going on over there? - Dancer- - Come on, let's go. (shushing) - Seems our lemon's dried out. - What the hell do you suppose they meant by that? - I don't know. Bit I'm hungry. Come on, there ain't nothing happening here. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Listen to this. Something is going on out there that just doesn't sit right. Here. Now, that Dancer, Lemon, razzle, dazzle, that's not just truckers' talk. Now, they usually talk about the cops, and the kind of freight they are hauling. - So these guys are hauling fruits. - Boots, Boots, my God! When is the last time you saw a woman driving a diesel rig? - That was a woman's voice wasn't it? - Oh, bless you, Jesus! Bless you. - Okay. Who's next? - I told Clyde no mustard. - You eat mustard on everything else. - Not with steak sandwiches. - I'm not quite so sure it's steak. Tastes more like Clyde's boot sole. - At least the mustard is good. - West-bound 18 wheeler, East-bound Black Eagle. This is Hogbreath. Do you copy? - Yeah, yeah, clear, it's good to hear your voice. - I just brown bottled up. One hand in the chicken coop. I'm ready for some tunnel action. - Tunnel! But there are no tunnels in this part of the country? - About two miles past Johnson's gas station. You'll see a sweet chocolate van. Got some real fine Annies there. Ask for the one that can wink you off. - Okay now, no one's taking the answer. Just what was that all about? - Quite simple, really, "brown bottle", means he is having a beer. "One hand in the chicken coop", means that the fellows at the way station gave him some trouble. That "Annie and tunnel" double talk, that, that's still a mystery to me. - You gonna finish that sandwich? - Damn right, I'm gonna finish it. Boots, I'm telling there is something going on out there that just isn't on the straight and narrow. - What do you mean? - I think we better go over to Johnson's and have a little looksie. - I think the part of the story comes in here. - I think we're on a story. Yes, sir. This CB set is gonna lead us to the spot where man and destiny collide. - How was Hogbreath? - That dude was hung like a (speaking foreign language). - Good evening, ladies and gentleman, this is Walter Cronkite. Tonight, our profile of the internationally famous, Pulitzer Prize winning, White House corespondent, JR Mountain Dean. A mountain of man. A mountain of power. (funky music) - Ah, business as usual down Johnson's there. - Shall we turn back? - Hell no! We are on a story. - Could it be that Mountain Dean will chalk up another broken heart? We recall, last month, when Dean spurned the proposal of marriage from TV's rock singing star, Claire Brown. She decided to quit everything and become a nun. When asked about this latest development, Dean's only reply was- - Not a chance, fellas. Those jet-set dollies are nothing but playthings to me. - Huh? - Nothing. - C, four-letter word for drops would be, glide? - Hey, look there, isn't she something? - Yeah, she got a CB antenna too. Let's take a gander. - Honey! Honey! - What? - There's two men snooping around the van. What are they snooping for? They sure don't look right. - Yeah, you're right. Sure do. - What are we going to do? - Well, my daddy always said, "The best defense is an offense." - Yeah, just don't get too offensive. - Afternoon, gentlemen, what can I do for you? - Good afternoon, mister. - Afternoon, lovely afternoon ain't it? - Sure is. - My name is Mountain Dean. And this is Boots Clayborn. - Howdy. - Howdy. - We are from the Clarion Weekly. - Oh, well, ain't that nice! - Mighty fine looking rig you got here. - Yeah, well, would you boys like to step inside and have a coke or something? - My pleasure, mister. - Be my guest. Make yourself at home, a little cramped. - Aww! - Hey, honey! Come on in, we got visitors. - Laura Mae Turner, this is the little lady. And I'm Billy Bob Turner. This is Boots Clayborn. - It's real honor, ma'am. - Mountain Dean, ma'am, likewise. - These are gentleman from the newspaper, honey. - Oh, how interesting. - Well, what can we do for you boys? - Well, Mr. Turner, our newspaper the Clarion Weekly, you've heard of it, haven't you? - Oh, I read them everyday. - Well, we are doing a big article on CB radio, and your van being so original and all and you having an outfit why, we thought we might do a feature on it. And you, with your permission, of course. (chuckling) Right, Boots? - Oh, yeah. - That would be just so lovely. - Well, there ain't special about Laura Sue or me, or the CB or the vans. We are just simple people doing our thing, right, honey? - Oh why, Billy darling, I think you're being far too modest. Why don't you tell these nice gentleman about our CB sales company? - Oh, yeah! Well, you see, gentleman, this is like our warehouse. We go around selling the CB units, right out of the van, person to person. Saves us overhead. - Oh, that's very interesting. How are your prices? - Oh! Right on. You see, this is something we can really get our teeth into. Listen, could we continue this interview when we have more time to spend on it? - Why, sure. - Good. - Well, I must say, this is one of the most incredible vans that I have ever seen. It really is. - Well, it's not the much. - Also, the color schemes you have in here. - Oh, these here are my uh daughters and my sales ladies. This is Diane. - Nice to meet you. - This is Sally. - Much obliged. - And this our youngest, Deborah. - Nice to meet you. - Listen, you think it over and we'll catch up to you. Are you going to the big CB van rally over in Deerfield? - Yeah, that's what we're here for. - Okay, we will see you there, bye. - Bye! - Bye. - So you think those two guys are for real? - I think they were news hogs. But I don't think they were after a story about CB units. - Yeah, but they wouldn't know what we are up to unless one of our men let it spill. - Our boys would just be killing their own action. And they like to keep it in their trucking family. - Hmm. Well, I think just to be cool, we'll go to that rally. - Yeah, why don't we do it, and pick up some side money. - Good idea. - Yeah. - Back there isn't straight. - That Laura June sure was pretty. Pretty litter of kids. - Where do they get their money? - They look just like her. - I'll bet my half of the Clarion Weekly, they ain't her kids. And I'll bet your half of the Clarion Weekly, that he ain't her husband. - By damn! I bet you're right. Ah, something fishy is going on out there. He's blackmailing her. - Ah, she's in on it with him. - Them aint their kids? - What the hell are they up to? - Can't be, she's too young for offspring that old. - Well, I don't know they looked more than 15. - Laura June ain't much more than that. - You suppose they are just living together? - Are you throwing off on Laura June? - No, no. But something is going on out there. And she is in on it with him. - In on what? Laura June is a virgin of a woman, if I ever saw one. - (laughs) Are you crazy? - No, I just know. Now, them ain't her kids, and I'll bet you they ain't, and he ain't her husband. She'd never marry something like that. It just stands to reason that she is pure. - As the driven snow! I'm still gonna keep my eyes on them, because there's a story in this. - You ain't gonna do nothing to Laura June! Not without your permission. - Hey! Mama has got everything under control. - Where the hell you girls been? CB units been burning up with all kinds of action, and you are out there hustling that amateur trade. - Oh, relax darling. We've been taking care of this. - What are you talking about? - Well, seems old Silky got a hold of that news hog, Boots, and when I caught him, he had his long stroke showing. (laughing) - You're kidding. Chalk one up for our side. - Those numb nuts must have been listening in on our CB. They got suspicious and they thought they'd expose us, if you'll excuse the expression. - Scuzz catches him blowing a minor, tells him the consequences and baby and daddy are home free. - Oh, I'll be damned. And here I was plotting my next move, getting mad at you girls. And all the while, you are out, saving the settlers and the Indians. - Well, Silky saved the day. I'll tell you when she got through with old Boots, he didn't know his ass from his elbow. - And a big drink to old Silky. - Hollywood's Robert Redford, the most dashing actor on the screen today, has just been found by Omnipotence Production, to play the most sought after masculine role in film history. "The Life and Loves of Mountain Dean." Screenland experts don't believe that Redford, is macho enough for the part. But he does bear a remarkable resemblance to the legendary Dean. (static hissing) - Hello, Meredith, Boots around there? Talking? Your husband. I don't know why he should be coming around there, looking for me I suppose. Yeah, well, I love you too, dear. Yeah, I'll be home for supper. Yeah, bye. Where the hell have you been? Boots, I think I know what's going on. Now, Turner told me that his CB call name was Hotel. But he lied. - You ever stop and think that you might be boring to some folks. Maybe Mr. Turner didn't want you calling and bugging him. - He is called Dancer. - Hogbreath to Dancer, do you copy? - Get away from there. Get your hands off of that! What's the matter with you? - Copy, copy. - Me and Eagle and Moonshine are nearing your cab and ready to boogie. - Sorry, old buddy, no boogieing tonight. A little victory celebration. If you boys lay over, we can pick you up tomorrow. - Sounds fair enough. - Over and out for the night. - Tell that Lemon, that I want it fresh. - See, Boots? Those guys keep asking for fruits. But there are no fruits on that Turner van. - I don't want to hear it. - That Turner, alias Dancer, he is the leader. And those daughters of his, and if they are his daughters, are no more than a bunch of little whores. - Now wait, wait a minute, Mountain. Them girls are all too young to be whoring and they seemed awful nice. - I'm going out there tomorrow and kick the frosting off his cake. - You might be getting into mighty trouble if you go out there, you know. We don't wanna get nobody in trouble, do we? - You gonna be playing with fire. Fire! Hell! You and I are gonna make those big Watergate newsmen look like a bunch of cub reporters. - You gonna go out there and get us in over your head. - I want you out there first thing in the morning, Boots. And bring your camera, we're gonna catch those bastards in the act. Something else, I better bring along. This is big apples. Which one is the mightier, Boots? We'll find out tomorrow. - Yeah, I think it's about time we put old Boots on. Hi, Bootsie! - Who is that? - Are you there, Bootsie? - Who is that? - It's just little old me. Silky! - Oh! Hello, little lady. - Are you alone? - Yeah, Mountain has gone home. - Are you sorry for what you did today? - I'm truly sorry. - Did you go to church like my mama told you to? - I was just fixing to. As your mama said, I was just going. - Well, you better. - Oh, yes. - Reflect in church by yourself tomorrow? - I'm afraid so. - You make sure it doesn't tumble down to anything Or my mommy will spank you. - Now, he already thinks that your daddy is running a whorehouse. Ah, excuse me, ma'am. - That's okay, I have heard the expression before. - I told him it weren't true. It ain't, is it? - Why, of course not. - Yeah, I didn't think so. I'm not sure that he believed me. - You make sure nothing screws up. You hear? - I hear ya! Now Mountain can be often stubborn sometimes. - Well, you just make sure you don't. See you, good night. - I guess. (all cheering and applauding) - Well, my darlings, that was an Academy Award performance. - You know, it might sound unbelievable but I really believe that she likes the old bear. - You're kidding. - Uh-uh. - Oh, come on, Dee. You're a baddie. If woman didn't have a pussy, she wouldn't have a friend in the world. - Ah, our leader. If we didn't have pussies, you would have to go to work for a living. - That's what you think, I got a big surprise for you. I got 15 grand stashed in a sock. Little cushion, so we can dump this rollin' whorehouse and just be folks. - You sly old fox. - The way I figured is, we give the gals three grand apiece, and Hotbox Two if they want it. You and I start a new life. Clean. What do you say? - You're really serious? - Uh-uh. - Oh, it sounds mighty tempting, darling. - What do you think, girls? - Whatever you say, Dancer. - But who will take care of the girls? - We can handle it ourselves, and besides it might be fun. - Sure. - Don't worry, I'll come up with something. Why don't we sleep on it And we'll catch it tomorrow, huh? - Excellent idea. Night, night. - Night. - Night. - Where the hell have you been? Didn't I tell you to be out here, first thing this morning? - I been to church. - Church? You haven't been to church for 20 years! - I just felt like going. - Where is your camera? Didn't I tell you to bring your camera? - Yeah. - Well, where the hell is this? - I left it at home. Them Instamatics ain't no good anyway. - Damn! I wanted a photo finish. - Didn't I see you stop, talk to those boys, back down there? - Yeah, mm-hm. And I got my information. - About what? - Boots, you're getting dense. Don't you remember what we're doing out here in the first place? Those Turners, if they are Turners, are running a traveling cat house. - Let's go get a beer. Come on, I'll buy. - The hell you say. Those girls are charging $25 a hay roll. - What? You don't think that $25 might be something for tax, do you? - Tax! Tax on what? Listen, as far as I know beaver isn't an endangered species. That's play money! - You absolutely sure? - Boots, have you been in Clyde's home brew again? I tell you, the stuff has got you talking to yourself. - I'll see you later. - You come back here, we've got work to do. Never mind. I'll do it myself. There's a Pulitzer Prize in this one. I can smell it. Ha! Hi, Sheriff. How is crime and violence? Listen, you will have to excuse me. I'm on a hot news tip. - Well, don't get too far away. 'cause I'm about to get myself some stripes. And I want the very best news coverage that I can possibly have. So the people down at the county know exactly what kind of a job I have done. - Oh, what are you on to, Sheriff? - Well, (chuckling) I'll tell you just so you know exactly where to be. But you know there is a couple of very fancy vans around here, and they ain't exactly what they like people to think they are. - I sure hope you have a good case, Sheriff. I don't like to print fairy tales. - Well, you ain't gonna have to 'cause I got warrants and everything. - Hey, Sheriff, there has been a bad accident down the road, you better call an ambulance. - (sighs) Damn it, Mountain. Stand by, I'll be right back. - Now, look-a here, miss. I know what you have been up to. You fooled me with the virgin bit. But no more. No more, you are a grown woman. - I sure am. You're so masterful when you're mad. One kiss from your cruel lips. Come here, you great big lug. (knocking on door) - Good morning, Dancer. - Well, it took you long enough to figure it out. Come on in. - I smelled you out, right from the start. Who do you think you were fooling with that tunneling and lemon and prune routine? You know, you have to get up pretty early in the morning to fool old Mountain Dean. Oh, yeah! I even talked to some of your customers, they spelled out the whole thing. - What are you gonna do about it? - I'm gonna bust this thing wide open. - What's your partner gonna think about it? - Whoa! You might have had him fooled with that virgin-stirgin routine, but I'll set him straight. You and your rolling cat house, have thrown me the last hump, Mr. Smarty. - What makes you think so? - Because when my story breaks, there isn't a trucker alive that would touch you with 10-foot tire iron. - Let me ask you something? - Shoot. - How much do you and your partner make a week on the newspaper business? - Roughly, 55 to $60 a week, after expenses. - That much, huh? How would you and Boots like to own this rolling cat house? - What? - With you two boys running the operation, you will get a better clientele. You'd lend and air of respectability. And you will get a little side action for yourself. - I wouldn't dream of such a thing. - 2500 tax free dollars a week could buy a lot of drinks. - $2500? That's what you take in in a week? - On a bad week. - But, where does that leave you? - Oh, I guess old Dancer is trying to make an honest woman of me. - That's right, honey. - $2500 a week, huh? I don't know, oh! Oh, but I do know that the local county mounty knows more about you than I do. And he's got papers to prove it. But if he gets to you before I do, I lose my scoop. - Honey, I think the man has just bought us some time. - The noblest know him as the public good. Dean. (engine revving) - Hotbox Two, wrap it this minute. County mounty on the way with iron. I repeat, county mounty on the way with iron. - Cops are coming. (funky music) (all laughing) (all cheering) (cheering) - Yeah. (siren wailing) (siren wailing) (tires screeching) (siren wailing) - Hey, did that Sheriff come across the county line? - No, darling, he sure didn't. - Then why the hell are we running? - Mayday, mayday! Attention, all you truckers. Now, hear this. I want you to listen up and I want you to listen up tight. Yes, I mean you. You double crunching degenerates. I just thought you'd like to know, that aren't laying any track around here anymore. Because the tunnel has just caved in. That's right! There is no more fruit around either. No lemons, no prunes, no watermelons, no nothing, not even a grape. Because the entire crop just died of a frost. Oh, yes. I broke up your little playhouse, and your Dancer, and Prancer, and Donner and Blitzen are gone! Finito, fini, kaput. Yes, I did it to ya. And I did it single handedly. In spite of a corrupt news staff. So Mr. Moonshine and Mr. Hogbreath and Hogwash, and all you other 18-wheel tramps, can just go and look elsewhere for your little filthy freeway frolics. The game is over! This town is clean. And it's gonna stay that way, you got it? Oh, yes. My name is JR Mountain 'Scoop' Dean of the Clarion Weekly, a free man, and a free press. And if you want me, well, you know where to find me. - Well, now, Mr. Mountain Dean, we'll see about that. - This here is Big Boots in Hotbox Two. Now we are setting up, brand new warehouse just full of lemons and prunes and watermelons. It will be business as usual. So Mr. Mountain Dean, you can forget about being the second coming of Eric Severaid, and yup! Ain't nothing gonna stop the CB Hustlers. (funky music)
