Come on, dude, I'm not pleasing you? You never saw it? My salutations. What have you brought to me? What about the pack? What do you want? Fake salami to take away. Ice cream! Ice cream! Ice cream! Ice cream. Give me an apple. Take me! What's the matter? What a hottie! Give it to me. No! Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Love each other. Give it to me. Did you see the bride? Did you see the bride? Can't we talk about brides anymore? Bride... bride? Who, me? A fake one. Awesome! Cool. Who ordered? He said only to come back at night. Give it to me. Crist?v?o! Crist?v?o! Didn't you see Crist?v?o? Didn't you see Crist?v?o? My God... Nobody saw my man? Let me be the witness. Let me be the witness. Come on! He agreed! Crist?v?o! Crist?v?o! Tell Crist?v?o I'll be right back. My flower... where's my flower? Grow and multiply! What's the matter? That's all? Tomorrow. No!
