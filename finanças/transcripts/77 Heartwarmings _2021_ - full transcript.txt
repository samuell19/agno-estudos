Do you really want to break up? I did empty the wardrobe. Did you think I was just getting them dry cleaned? We're adults. You should've just told me directly. It's exactly because we're adults that not everything has to be so direct. I'm not wealthy and I'm not very smart. But I know exactly what I want. "Heartbeat Shutter." He's always out drinking with his friends. And he's a reckless driver. How can I not worry about him? I know, is it so hard to make a phone call or send a text? Eva's father had a wish: For his daughter to find a good husband. Mrs. Lui, I did think about marriage. The happiness I'll give you will definitely make up the 77 times I broke your heart. I hope you can forgive me one last time. You'd already closed the file, but here you are again. You're just torturing yourself. I left that notebook out on purpose for you to see. My guess is that girl left this out on purpose for me. Look I was in a mess. I don't have... Leave me alone! That's a definite no. You look gorgeous! How's this one? No way! Cheers! It's too tight. One, two, three! Solicitor Eva Lui! Are you ready to go? White already comes with so many styles. It's hard to pick. Men are no different. They come in all shapes and sizes, too. Afraid of picking the wrong one? No. I'm not ready. You're usually so decisive! But now you're just throwing out excuses. If you do pick the wrong one, just get a divorce. I'm moving heaven and earth to put together this wedding just so I can get divorced? According to statistics, 11.61 million marriages were registered nationwide last year. - "Divorce Big Data" - Meanwhile, there were 2.32 million divorces and a 20% increase in divorce rate. This means that one out of five marriages end in divorce. That's a divorce happening every three minutes. Based on the cases our firm has handled, the top ten reasons for divorce are: He doesn't love me anymore. That's right, I don't love her anymore. We haven't talked in over 40 years. He never gave me a cent to raise these kids. Don't play with that. Isn't he useless? An irresponsible, useless piece of trash! I won't get alimony if I don't get divorced. How will I have a steady income then? Let me tell ya, lady, a family unit can only buy one home in China. Baby, if we're both single, then we can buy another home! So we can each have one! She's changed! She used to be thinner than me! She abuses me. Shut your mouth! No sex! I don't know why we got married. In the past year, our firm's offices in Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen saw business double. However... This is also the tragedy of our generation. "We held hands for the first time 8 years ago." Come in. Daisy says when you get to the airport in London, there will be a driver waiting for you. She's truly a winner at life. Even her kid's one-month banquet has to go international. Why don't you fly out early with me anyway? Oh, I know. You don't want to be on the same plane as NT Tang, right? Hi, Mr. Tang, I'm Eva. Hi there. You can just call me NT. He's already pretty nice for a nouveau riche. Plenty of girls would jump at the chance of marrying him. You would've been set for life. What are you doing? Wow, your phone still misses Adam. You guys have split for a year already. Good thing you back up the phone regularly. Be yourself! Be happy! "Be yourself, be happy" I wish... Be happy... Excuse me it's time to close. Sorry. Miss. We've transferred your phone's data in lightning speed. Take a look. How do I unlock it? The factory setting for this phone is the M shape. Make an "M" to unlock it. If you have anything against the word "M" then change it when you get home. Go online and see if it works now. Perfect. All done. "Why are you still single?" "Bcoz I love myself the most." "I over think things and it's hard to love someone new." "Because I can't handle another betrayal." "Because I don't want to sacrifice so much for someone else." "Freedom!" Another bottle, handsome? Thanks. "We held hands for the first time 8 years ago." I'll treat your mother better. I won't drive drunk anymore. And I won't buy those raisin cookies anymore. All the mistakes I made in that book, I'll never make them again. Believe me. "Once, I had the love of a lifetime, but I didn't treasure it!" Cut the crap. You guys broke up a year ago, you don't have to act brokenhearted forever. Right now, you ought to be happy. You've just escaped a maximum security prison. You can't go back just because you left a bottle of beer in the cell, dummy! One of this, please. Me, too. Thank you. Where's Francis? His wife didn't grant him a release, I guess. You have to understand, having the freedom to watch football is some kind of bliss. We used to be happy, too. When we watched games at his place, Eva used to take such good care of us. She served us drinks, she made us instant noodles. And that crispy chicken! So delicious. Do you know how hard it is to have a friend with a girlfriend that can cook as well as her? Look, we're here to watch football, and other ball-shaped objects. What a ball game! - Thanks, guys. - You're the real winner. Such a nice ball game. You didn't even take a peek. They were spilling out. You can keep them. Sure. You pulled a prison break? No. My wife and her mother are away visiting family. Good thing I didn't have to go with them. So once I dropped them off at the airport, I came straight here to see you rascals. It's really been a while, rascal. Yeah. The last time I saw you, you were just a little fat. Now you've really blown up. Go to hell, man. Dude, you just wanted a girl, right? Why did you get married? There are so many dating apps out there. What I mean is, you can't give up all the functions on your phone for a single app. I really do love my wife. I gained weight because I'm happy. And I enjoy being ordered around. What do you care? Second half's starting soon, so shut up. We've already lost in the first half. They'll catch up in the second half. That's what makes the game so exciting, right? He lost 77-0 to Eva in the first half. You try catching up! Come on. It's your fault for getting caught red-handed. The very night you split up with Eva, you brought a girl home. You deserved what you got. I don't agree. He was drunk, and he was technically broken up with Eva at the time. Girls always expect you to be like them. You have to go through the mourning period. If you bring a girl home within the first â™ª days, you're disrespecting the dead! Drink up and shut up. Drink up, you two, you're talking too much. You know, I use an apology app on my wife all the time. You should take a look. That's absurd! Mom, I'm back. Welcome home. How are you feeling today? Is your stomach better? What about you? You can't skip your medication. Those pills make me drowsy all the time. What have we done to deserve this? Me with the depression and you with the stomach problem. You really should move. You should live in a more comfortable place. What for? This is my home. Some tasks are a little hard without a man around, that's all. Everyone uses those 15 energy conserving bulbs now. These fluorescent lights are old and hard to buy. I asked your dad to change them, but he refused to. Got it. Mom... Dad's been gone for so long. If you need to cry, you can do it in the living room. It's so stuffy in the kitchen. Women don't have to suffer like this anymore. I'm not suffering. I told you, I may have married the wrong man, but I had the right daughter. But you've devoted your whole life to your husband and daughter. You ought to do something for yourself. Be happy. I'm happy if you're happy. By the way, I'm going to the UK to see Daisy tomorrow. I won't be around to take care of you. You should call up your friends. I don't need friends. They're so annoying. There's bound to be an exception. There is. There's one. But I haven't seen him in decades. I don't even have his number. It's easy to find someone these days. Give me the name and I'll find him for you. It's that easy? His name is Tsang Po-wah. Tsang Po-wah... Never mind. It's been decades. I don't even know if he's still alive. Remember to bring your stomach medicine. I got it. Need anything from the UK? I have to spend my money somewhere... I'm sorry, Eva. I'm sorry, Eva. This is so stupid! Let's go that way. We're trying to find our way. This isn't a maze. You can't just guess a way out. Let's just go! Let me help you. Or you'll hurt your hip again. Did you bring your passport? You know how forgetful you are. Of course I did. Wait, no way. I told you! You're always like this. It's not your first time missing I knew you'd throw a tantrum. We're in a rush, stop playing! Let me help you. Thanks. Eva. Do you know what today is? It's not the anniversary of our first meeting. It's not the anniversary of the first time we held hands. It's the first anniversary of our breakup. In the past year, I keep feeling like I've lost something. I feel like I've lost myself. I don't know what I can do to make you forgive me the 78th time. But if you do give me one more chance I won't let you down. Next, please. Sorry, but my phone's out of battery. Where can I charge it? We have a temporary charging station inside. - Great. - You can go in now, Thank you. Marvell! Marvell! Sorry. It's OK, she's harmless. This is for you. Thank you. I remember you, you're Melody. Marvel is in a rush. We should go now. Marvel. I have some bad news. My parents are getting divorced. What should I do? How can I go on like this? How can I be happy again? Yours, Melody. Thank you. I didn't know girls still do knitting these days. This is for a special person. A special one? Oh, for your kid, right? No. For my friend's kid. You must be very patient... Kind and... old school. You must be very neat and sentimental. Me? Sentimental? You look sad holding the paper heart over there. You mean the origami? I shouldn't say this, but you look familiar. Sir, flight HW77. Last call for boarding. Oh, I gotta go. Oh, my phone. Bye. Bye. Thank you very much. Mrs. Lui. They're writing parking tickets. It's okay. I've seen your car around a few times. I really don't get how you young people think. Back then, once you lose touch with someone, it was for good. But it's so easy to find people now. You can just make a call or find them on the internet. This is useless Mrs. Lui! "Eva's phone." Hello. What's going on? Everything's in Thai. My phone. Bye. Bye. Thank you very much. No way... Eva. Do you know what today is? It's not the anniversary of our first meeting. It's not the anniversary of the first time we held hands. It's the first anniversary of our breakup. In the past year, I keep feeling like I've lost something... This is for you. This is lovely. Did you knit this? That's so thoughtful. It's not like people who give cheap gold accessories! I don't know what I'm supposed to do with them! - Hi, ladies. - It's beauitful... Hi, baby. You mind if I steal our little princess? Yeah, of course, that's a good idea. Thank you. Go to daddy. - Bye. - Thanks, daddy. Bye, Daisy. I'm amazed you had the time to knit a hat. The baby's head is so small, I got it done on the plane. So? Have you located my phone yet? Not yet. If your phone is off, there's no way to track it. Maybe he's still on the plane. What should I do? How did you screw that up? How did you switch your phone with a Thai guy anyway? So I guess you can call this a "Tom Yum Phone"! That's a terrible joke. Was he trying to steal your phone or steal your heart? - What are you talking about? - Steal your heart. Hey, look at this. These photos are pretty cool. - Let me see. - What's that? That looks familiar. That's the Star Ferry Pier. Oh, "A Brokenhearted Dolphin". How do you know? And this is "Lazy Afternoon". It's the name of the piece. The guy who made this is named Space-time Intruder. Even to this day, no one knows who he is. But he's already intruded over 35 cities and left 890 intruder pieces. There are 75 in Hong Kong alone. How did you not know this? I don't care who he is. Putting stickers on buildings like that is against the law. He's only in trouble if he gets caught. He just conquered Central last week. Maybe the phone doesn't actually belong to that Intruder guy. Maybe he's just a fan. It doesn't matter. If he's handsome, then this is awfully romantic! Think about it. The same phone model. The same pattern lock. It's fate. It's fate. I totally agree. I've looked into this. There are 389,112 possible lock patterns on this phone. For two people to have the exact same lock pattern... This is destiny. The lock pattern was the factory setting. This destiny you're talking about... It only happened because I didn't have time to change it. I have an idea. Why don't we look at the messages on this Tom Yum Phone? No way, it's an invasion of privacy. Sorry, ladies. - I think our little baby just made a mess. - Don't be such a lawyer... Could you give me a hand? I have to go upstairs. Sorry. See you later. Hello, Eva! I'm fine, thank you. She didn't say "How are you?" It's been four whole seasons since we last met. I'm sure that you've missed me very much. I need the bathroom. - I'll wait here for you. - Hello? Why are you calling my phone? Eva, Adam's looking for you. Ask him what he wants. - She'd like to know what you want. - Sorry, what did you say? What's the matter with you guys? The Thai guy called. He says he can go to Hong Kong to switch the phones back. Really? When? He didn't say. He said he'll call again. Eva, Adam says that your mother's in the hospital. Okay. Thank you. You won't be able to get on a flight tonight. It's full. The ticketing agent says the earliest flight back is tomorrow. It's done. Pack up and go to the airport. Miss Lui. This rose is from Mr. Tang's winery in Champagne, Chateau du Tang. This rose is called "All My Loving", It's grown exclusively at Mr. Tang's rose garden. This is a 77% cocoa dark chocolate, the latest from NT And The Chocolate Factory. You can go back now that you're done. Yes, sir. Eva, guess what this chocolate is called. It looks like... A melty tear. It looks like a melting teardrop. I'm romantic, aren't I? I'm sorry, Mr. Tang, for having to fly me back to Hong Kong. I'll pay you back for the flight. If I make you pay me back, then I'd be really sorry. You're so much poorer than me. Money is of no object to me. I value my time and effort far above that. Just take some time, focus on the now, and get ready to enjoy the entertainment I've prepared. Are we watching a movie? I like watching movies. I don't talk when I watch movies. Brilliant minds think alike. The best entertainment is chatting with me. So let's chat. You start. Then why don't we tell jokes? Good idea. Once, I bought some expensive caterpillar fungus and I asked my domestic worker to cook it. She brought it over to me, but I'd actually bought it for the dog. I can't believe that she had no idea. Isn't that funny? Your turn. I I don't have many... That's hilarious! That's a good one. It's fun to tell jokes. But I'd like to talk to you about some romantic things. Do you know what GDP stands for? Gross Domestic Product? Good answer. Let me tell you a story. Once there were two economists named Adam and Smith. They were taking a stroll together when they spotted a drop of dog poo. Adam says to Smith, "If you eat it, I'll give you a million dollars." Smith really eats it, so Adam gave him a million bucks. Then they kept on strolling until they spotted a drop of cat poo. This time, Smith says to Adam, "If you eat it," "I'll give you back your million dollars." So Adam eats it and Smith really does return the million bucks. Well, that's dumb. No one made any money, but they both ate poo. But that's not how economists think. It's true that no one ate money and both of them ate poo, but the GDP went up by 2 million. Everyone feels richer for it. I'm such a romantic, aren't I? I'm sleepy. I'm going to get some sleep. You really look like my dead mother. Not when your eyes are opened. When they're closed. She looked just like that when she died. She didn't toss around. And she breathed less. Her heart stopped, too. Your husband died such an unjust death! How can you die so early? - Our flat isn't even paid off yet, son! - Sit down... Hello? Yeah, he's dead! What will we do about the flat? Eva. Where's Mom? Come with me. Mom. - You're back already? - Are you okay? I'm fine. What did the doctor say? He says it's a spell of anaemia, but I think it's better to get more tests. Thank you, Adam. You're welcome. Thank my family's domestic worker for this. When my mother was in the hospital, she made soup for her, too. Thanks. I'll get you some water. Let me. The doctor is coming on his rounds anytime now, so you can talk to him directly. Hey. Sit down. Adam always hangs around downstairs waiting for you. But he didn't want you to know. He brought you to the hospital? I'm fine. You should lie down. Would you like dessert? We have two choices, blackcurrants cake and macaron. Definitely not the black currents cake. You don't eat processed fruits. Two macarons, please. Sure, thanks. Thank you. How did you lose your phone? It's unbelievable. Good thing you knew to call Cat. Two macarons. Thank you. - Thanks. - Enjoy. Have mine. I know you like it. So How have you been? My father and stepmom moved back to Vancouver for retirement. He sold his shares in the law firm to his partners. You know me. I never liked working in my dad's firm. Besides, M&A work isn't for me. That's good, you can keep teaching kickboxing, then. I already am. As long as you're happy. But I'm also trying new things. Like what? Sorry I'm interrogating you like a mom. Go ahead. It's been forever since someone asked me questions like these. Sorry, it's time for last order. Would you like anything else? I'm full. The check, please. Thank you. Thanks. Are you okay? Just some gas. I'll be fine after I take my pills. Say... did you receive my text message? What message? Never mind. Is there any doubt? I'm 100% sure that he wants to win you back with that message. He's been on probation for a year now, it's time to absolve him. Feelings change, but people don't. What will you do, Eva? Nothing. I'll be zen. I want to see a happy ending! No way. Adam should've known better, right? It's good to stay single. Live worry-free. Go anywhere you want. You're just boring. I'm going to ignore your opinion. I have the longest CV when it comes to relationships. Trust me on this. Oh, shut up already. You think you're a judge? Court... The trial is in session. A trial? Are you kidding me? Silence! Your Honor, I object to our Plaintiff getting back with the Defendant. In the words of Albert Einstein, "A woman who repeats the same mistake will suffer the same fate no matter how many times she tries." When did Einstein say that? Your Honor, I hold evidence proving that the Plaintiff still misses the Defendant. Wow, your phone still misses Adam. I want to help my BFF pick a wedding dress... Objection! I don't want to wear another bridesmaid dress. Besides, I don't get why people still get married. Your Honor, evidence shows that there are plenty of great guys waiting for her. For example, my crazy rich boss, NT Tang. Everyone, money is not the most important thing for the Plaintiff. The most important thing is that modern women have a choice. It's no crime to be single! Yet, a lot of women search day and night only to still end up with scraps. Let's hear some objective facts from the Plaintiff. We have to consider the Plaintiff's best interest. I see her in the office every day. I'm the only who truly understands her. No, I'm the one who understands her. I understand her so much more. Silence! Or I'll disbar all of you. Eva Lui. What do you have to say for yourself? This moment, I want to tell the world that you, Eva Lui taught me all about... Love! I, Eva Lui, want to tell the world that the only person I love is my mother. Lin? Is that Lin? Po-wah! Are you Po-wah? I've been looking for you for 40 years! You haven't changed one bit. Your eyes are just getting old. No way. I just had cataract surgery last year. We've both grown, so old. I'm so happy. If we hadn't come in for maintenance at the same time, we wouldn't have met again. Just a coincidence, that's all. To be honest... After losing touch all those years ago, I never found another girlfriend as compatible as you. How have you been? I've been well. I have a daughter. She's all grown up now. She's a lawyer. Here. I'll show you. She's awfully pretty. Like you. This guy is the boyfriend she's always arguing with. Why did you pick him? My mother made the call. I went on a lot of arranged dates. Out of all the guys I met... He's the one that looked the most like you. Did he treat you as well as I did? For better or worse, we had a life together. It went by in the blink of an eye. He's passed away now. I don't know how long I'll last, either. Don't say that. Hong Kong women have the longest life expectancy in the world. Even longer than the men. What are you in the hospital for? I'll give you three choices. I'll buy you an ice cream cone if you get it right. A: "The three highs". B: A stroke. C: Cancer. Don't joke about that. I can't handle the shock. I'm easygoing about my own mortality now. I just miss my friends. I worked as a tour guide for 40 years. I've been all over the world and I've seen all kinds of things. You're lucky. I just convince myself I've been to a place after seeing it on a travel show. You've led a fortunate life. The only regret is I couldn't marry my first love. Look at how old we are. No point talking about that. How did you end up in here, then? I fainted on the street. The doctor says it's anaemia. The tests are taking forever. Do you have diabetes? If you don't let's go get an ice cream gone. The convenient store in this hospital has that Apollo brand that we used to love. How's that sound? You're so nostalgic. The old is new again. Come on. Where do you live now? Not far from here. It is. Hey, Adam. Sorry. What's up? Your ex-student is over there. When I paid the tuition fee, you guys said that it can be refunded. No... So what should I do? Should I report you to the Consumer Council? Company policies state that a refund is only possible under special circumstances. According to our records, you've never called to make a leave of absence. It's your trainer that doesn't want to train me! I didn't even have a chance to take a leave of absence. Let me handle this. Sure. Sorry, there was a long line at the ATM. Your refund. Count it. I threw away the old one. Clearing your debt? How's your Eva? We almost got back together, but your contact lens case ruined it. I returned her notebook to you. And that contact lens case? Did you leave it behind on purpose? I don't know. Even if I did, you should've known it wasn't Eva's. Blame yourself for being dumb. Without a backup phone like me, how would you know how much you missed your primary phone? All your memories, social media, everything important in your life was in that primary phone, after all. You were even crying "Eva, Eva" when you were drunk. Anyway, be careful meeting people next time. I really hate you. But I really like you, too. Still got my phone number? I've deleted it already. I'm heading back. It's okay, I still have your number. "5.77 Heartwarmings." I have good news. I'm going to marry Mandy, whom I've only known for 3 days. Sorry, I'm still in love with her. "Message - from Anon" Marvel, get some rest. We'll head to the airport in three hours, okay? Sure, see you soon. Dear Melody, if you want a happy ending, it depends where you want to stop the story. You can always start a new scene and give it some happiness. If you believe in it, your dreams will come true. Melody is your name. Let's play a joyful tune in your heart. Marvel. "Tom Yum Goong - I'll be in HK tmr." "I'm waiting for a job interview. I'm a little nervous." "I want to go to your place to pick up some things, is it OK?" "You can come home anytime." "NT Tang - I want to tell you what I'm doing right now." Eva, what I'm doing now is called. Shitali Pranayama yoga. It means cooling breath. The key is in the breathing, so the nostrils are really important. Come closer. You must find this interesting, Eva. I'll show you how to do it. Press on the right nostril with your left index finger and breathe. 1, 2, 3. Then press on the left nostril with your right index finger. Let go of your left hand, then breathe. 1, 2, 3. The last step is a little hard. Take your two index fingers and press down on both your nostrils. Then curl up your tongue. 1, 2, 3. Mom. You're here. What's with all the ice cream? Sweets make me happy. I had a nice dream last night. What happened? I dreamt your wedding. You know, you had a beautiful wedding dress on. Just when I was about to reach out to touch it, that nurse woke me up. No, I can't do this. Marvel, please don't be upset. You read the script? It's ridiculous. The father dies, the mother dies, the son dies, the daughter dies, I die. Everybody dies. Exactly, we all die in the end. Ginny, you better talk to the studio again. This is no use, the studio won't change the script nor will they change the contract we signed. It doesn't matter where we are heading to. There is only one map to the journey of life and it lives within our hearts. Welcome home. You're into gaming now? And you're reading psychology books? Don't have much else to do. It's not like you to be this neat. Why do you sit on the floor instead of the sofa? It's easier for work. Like this... whoa! What's going on? A cockroach! Where? Under the monitor. The neighbor didn't put the lid on the trash bin again! Stay off my keyboard! Off my keyboard! Go away... My book! Not the book! - Don't be scared. - Help! Help me! Good thing you were here. I was scared, too, but look at you. You were freaked out. What was I supposed to do? Do you think it's really dead? Wait, what are you doing? It's a bookmark now! Can I borrow your bathroom? It's your home, too. I'll give it an ocean burial. Then I'll go steam the fish. Did you see how well he cleaned the place? Of course he did, because you're not around. It means everything you did were in vain. There was a lot happening in his family. There was his dad's divorce, then his mom got sick. He was so upset. How could I bother him? And now he's got nothing better to do than to play games. That's called passion. People need to have hobbies, you know. That's not what you used to say. Don't say I didn't warn you. When a man wants you back, it's natural that he'll show you his best side. Once you're hooked, he returns to his old ways. I don't get why you're always so negative. You didn't come back for your stuff. You wanted to see if other girls left anything in the bathroom. I don't have time to argue with you. A steamed fish is best served hot. Hey, what were you doing on that bridge? What? Dinner's ready. Let's give this a try. Say, how did your interview go? They said that I gave the best answer. What was the question? Imagine... There's a blizzard outside and you're driving home. There are only two seats in the car. The blizzard's getting worse. You drive past a bus stop. You know the bus only comes once every three hours. There are three people waiting. The first person is your best friend. The second person is a sick old lady. And the third person is your dream girl. Remember, your car only has two seats. If you were the driver, how would you choose? Knowing you, you'd drive your friend. Nope. The old lady. You did drive my mother to the hospital. Not the dream girl. You'd fail the interview. Then what did you say? I... Sorry. Hello? Hey, want your phone back? Of course, it's very important. Do you know any good lawyer? Yes. I need your help. Please come to Wan Chai police station. Okay, I'm coming. Sorry, I have to go. Is everything okay? Sorry. What's wrong? Do you need a ride? No, I'll just get a taxi. Thanks for the dinner. Bye. Be careful. You can go now. Okay. These are your belongings. Yes. Sign here. Where's my... Thank you for bailing me out. Where's my phone? Oh, yes, sure. I need to work tomorrow. If I couldn't get out, I'd be in big trouble. You're already in big trouble in the first place. That's why you couldn't get out. Where's the lawyer? Me. Eva, please charge me. May I have your business card? Sure. So should I bill Space-time Intruder or Marvel? You watch my movies? Come on, your phone advertisements are everywhere. Will you keep my secret? Which one? You mean the real identity of Space-time Intruder or the arrest of the Thai movie star, Marvel? Listen, I can't let anyone know about my secret. It would be damaging to me, my clients, my agent and my fans. So you're asking me to shut up about your mistakes? I'm hiring you as my lawyer. We can sign a confidentiality agreement. You can charge me double or triple. Okay, I'll consider it. Bye. Hey, one more thing. I think you should go back to that Adam guy. Wait, you checked my messages? Adam's messages are sincere. Please don't ruin the happy ending... You have no right to intrude my privacy. Please stop telling me what to do with my life. You know nothing about me, nothing about him. It's none of your business. I'm not even a fan of yours! Cool, no one talks to me like you do. Adam, a student's waiting for you. Again? I already gave her back her money. It's a new student. He was here before we opened. Thanks. His name is Marvel, he doesn't speak Chinese. Hi. So you're Adam? You must be Marvel. How do you know me? We have a common friend on social media. I want to get to know you. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? Thailand. Do you know Muay Thai? Yeah, a little bit. But I practice kickboxing more. Let's try. Sure. I know him. He's a movie star! No wonder he looks so familiar. He doesn't look like he's here to learn. He's here to pick a fight. Show me your kickboxing. Show me your Muay Thai. You're not looking for a teacher. You're looking for a contender. It's not easy to find a contender like you. Same here. See you next time. Sure. You haven't changed one bit. You're still eating too slow. You haven't changed, either. Still eating too fast. And you got it all over your mouth. Ice cream melts, doesn't it? Every ice cream cone is like a race against time. And who won? In all my years of traveling around the world and meeting different people, no one's ever beaten time. That's why you should savor it, make it worth your while. Lin. We'd agreed to elope back then. Why didn't you show up? My family was against it. We can't be selfish. Since then, I'd miss you whenever I eat an ice cream cone. Everywhere I go. There's an ice cream shop in Okinawa that I'm dying to show you. Take me when I'm better. Sure. Why are you so late? I was supposed to take my mom home, but she got a headache. So I stayed with her while the doctor checked on her. It's that bad? I don't even know if she really has anemia. She told the doctor totally different things. Anyway, she needs to do more tests in the hospital. Like Spider-Man says, "With great power comes great responsibility." I'm the opposite, With great responsibilities come great power. I'm not Spider-Man, I'm just a normal human being. There are three surprises for you today. Congratulations. For what? I've done some checking for you. "Move of the day: Send her flowers." This is an app called "77 Heartwarmings". It's huge right now. Let's see who sent them. NT Tang. Adam. Anon? Who's that? Hello? Eva, call from the police station. Please put it on hold. Sure. Get me the template for the confidentiality agreement. Sure, give me the client's name. It's confidential. You and your secrecy... Cut! This is the confidentiality agreement. Let me explain, first... hey! You shouldn't sign anything before you understand the terms and conditions. I trust my lawyer. I appreciate that, but reality is not like movies. You're the only person who knows both sides of me. Anyway, they won't press any charges for now. So you're my lucky star. But still, the way you do art is illegal. I won't bail you out next time. "Kau csai". It means "I understand." Let me walk you out. When I'm on set, it feels like I'm traveling through a time tunnel. People only live once, but you can live as many lives as you want. You have different roles, too. A lawyer, a daughter and a nice girlfriend. Let me clarify. I'm a lawyer, you're right. I'm a good daughter, I guess. But I don't have a boyfriend. I guess you haven't gotten back together with that Adam guy yet. So he's the past, welcome back to the market. Chances of us being together in this space and time is destiny. You want to intrude space-time with me? Are you asking your lawyer to break the rules? Life is about breaking rules and knowing who you really are. I'm going back tomorrow. I don't know when I can see you again. You can text me anytime. This is not a good tool for communication. It's not the way we should stay connected. Then what? The shadow of your smile. The apple of my eye. You're the sunshine of my life. Perhaps you need to break from reality. Hey, Cat, Please help me send. Barrister Tong's contract to the Guangzhou office today. Yeah. Also, I won't be in the office today. Call me if anything comes up. Okay, bye. I have to go. Hey, I'll come back for you. It seems like a dream, we have to wake up somehow. At least not now. I don't want to get hurt again. You won't, I promise. You're here early. You're early, too. Don't you have work? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? Tell me. Mrs. Lui... We can't hide it from Eva anymore. What's wrong, mom? I'm fine. Tell me. It's nothing, really. Adam. We didn't tell you because we didn't want you to worry. But the doctor just came by. He confirmed that Mrs. Lui has brain cancer. Can it be cured? It doesn't matter. Everyone dies eventually, right? You can't say that! I'm your daughter, how could you hide it from me? You should've told me. It breaks my heart when you cry. Don't cry. It's alright. How could you do that? I'm fine. It'll be okay. Don't be like this, it doesn't help to be worried like this. I just want my mom to live a happy life, but now she's running out of time. I don't know what to do. My mind's a total blank. I'll go through this with you. Take a leave of absence from the firm so you can spend some time with your mom. When my mom had cancer, I met some brilliant doctors. I'll contact them for you. All these years, your mom treated me like a son. I'll do all I can for her. Thank you. Do you want me to go up with you? By the way my doctor friend recommended this stomach medicine. Try it. Hello? Hey, Eva, how's it going? Everything's okay. I just hope you're okay. Marvel. Please forget about me. Why? I'm here for you. I'm sorry, bye. Eva... Marvel, good news. The studio approved the happy ending you proposed. Oh, I see. Thanks, Ginny. Nurse, where's Lin? Which Lin, sir? The one who was at this bed. Is she okay? - I'm not sure. - She just came in for a dizzy spell. Please... Tell me where she's gone. I'll help you find out. I bought her an ice cream cone. Please. - I'll check for you. - Is she okay? I told you to stop crying. You're so pretty when you smile. Smile for me, will you? "Po-wah." "Po-wah - 27 missed calls". Oh, the poor thing can't get that off. He can't walk! It's so stupid! "Po-wah - I'm worried about you, you won't answer..." "Do you want to delete your conversation with Po-wah?" "Delete." All my life, I've only done whatever people want me to do. Can I finally call the shots this time? I don't want to keep switching hospitals. I don't want to keep switching doctors. I'm in pain. This is torture. Eva. This is for you. Really? This is beautiful. It'll take forever to fold all of these. "He broke his leg, he needs a cast..." "The first time he gave me flowers was" "I felt a shock the first time we held hands, - It's not that many. - "As the legends say..." - Just 3,000 of them. - 3,0007 - We'll fold it together. You can even write on them. Let me see what you wrote. "I felt a shock the first time we held hands, as the legends say!" "On our first trip, he forgot his passport!" "He got his driver's license for the first time!" Say... did you receive my text message? What message? I don't know what I can do to make you forgive me the 78th time. But if you do give me one more chance I won't let you down. I have the same dream every night. I dream that my daughter would have a romantic wedding. Will you make that dream come true for me? Go ahead and have another dream. You naughty girl! Go have your dream. Are you okay? Can you give me a hand? I'm coming in, then. It's gorgeous. Adam, did you know that one out of five marriages end in divorce? My parents are one of them. I don't want to force you. I don't want you to do this because my mom I want to do this. After our breakup, I thought maybe I had too many impractical fantasies and expectations for you. Maybe I read too many fairy tales with princes and princesses. Maybe I should be more like the people around me lower my expectations so I wouldn't be disappointed. You don't have to do that. If you feel uncomfortable after the wedding, you can choose all over again. Right now, fulfilling your mom's wish is the most important thing. Okay, Adam, this way... Good, look at each other. Another one. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Too many red balloons! 1, 2... Were you looking at him? Isn't it adorable? You two look great together! Look at this. You're really great together! The perfect match! Honey, that's a beautiful dress! Doesn't my daughter look pretty? "Marriage is between two people, but a wedding involves the world." The bridal car's OK. Fast and furious! "Flower shop's OK." "Make-up's OK." "The wedding venue is set." Please give me a job. Period. Except for arranging seating. "How's this backdrop? Discount from my friend, 35% off." I say again. Period. Don't force me to wear a bridesmaid dress. Exclamation mark. Excuse me. Hello? I'm flying out on working holiday tomorrow. Come out for a drink with me tonight, send me off. I'm getting married in a few days. Oh. To Eva? Yeah. You've got better taste than her, then. Anyway... Thanks for sending the link to "77 Heartwarmings". I didn't do it. Why would I do that? It wasn't you? Have a good marriage. If you get divorced, call me. Hey... Here you are. Your fan letters. Thanks. It's so cute. Drink mine. Thank you. Back here for filming? I hope it's not for another Space-time Intrusion. I came back for you. Marvel, my wedding's in a couple of days. So... You decided to give the audience a happy ending? As you said, life is about breaking the rules to find who you really are. Which means life and love are conflicting. Every movie has an ending. Why does it end here? The audiences. The wedding's not for me. Your case is closed. If I were you, I would change the ending. But I'm just a simple girl. I'm not Space-time Intruder. Thank you. Mrs. Lui. Wait here. You look beautiful today. What are they doing? Adam and I have a surprise for you. That's your mother. Look at this one! This is for you. Thank you. We've lost a lot of time. Today, in front of your daughter and Adam I'd like to ask... Will you marry me? I will I've picked a dress for you, Mom. Look. This dress... it looks like the wedding dress in my dream. You'll look beautiful in it. Thank you. Thank you all for attending... Wait! Don't get married! Stop the execution! You again? Wait... Don't mess things up here. You look familiar. Last time I'm not getting married. Sit down and be the VIP! Eva's mother is getting married. Congratulations, Mother-in-law. What? Mother-in-law? - Let's start. - Not true! Thank you for attending Mei-lin and Po-wah's wedding today. This is Lin. She doesn't have many hobbies. Her only hobby is taking care of her daughter. But she's never asked her daughter to take care of her. Women in her generation never asked for much. As long as their families stay together and stay happy, they'll feel content. All these years, Lin's responsibilities outweighed her own happiness. Lin didn't ask for this, but as your daughter and your wedding's witness, I hope that for the rest of her days, she'll find the happiness that she deserves. Tsang Po-wah, do you agree to be Chau Mei-tin's husband and make her happy? I do. Chau Mei-lin, do you agree to be Tsang Po-wah's wife and make him happy? I do. Please exchange wedding rings. I hereby pronounce you husband and wife. Enjoy your life, don't worry about me. You have to enjoy your life, too. My mom's in your hands now. Don't worry. Be good to my daughter. I will, don't worry! Will what?! I'll sponsor your honeymoon. I've never seen my mom had a smile that sweet. No matter how old a woman is, there's a young girl living inside. Stephen Hawking once said that even he can't fathom woman. Are we that hard to understand? You are, but I'll try my best to learn. Let me show you something. You still have this thing? What "thing"? This jar is called "From Your Stars". Who knows how long ago, I put the jar away and stopped folding the stars. Since then, I stopped remembering the good things. It's true, people seem to always remember the bad things. You keep it from now on. Take out a star once in a while and open it up. Remind me of the good things. Sure. Did you send this app to remind me? Didn't you send this to remind me to win you back? Anon? Who is it? It's confidential. I think you should get back with that Adam guy. You checked my messages? "Message - Anon." What is the app telling you to do? Invite her to do something she has never done before. What haven't I done before? You teach kickboxing here? Yeah, come on in. I keep forgetting to ask you. What was the answer you gave for that blizzard question at the interview? My answer was... Give the car key to my best friend so that he can drive the old lady to the hospital. Meanwhile, I stay at the bus stop and wait for the bus with the dream girl. Love is an instinct, but it takes some learning, too. You're into gaming now? And you're reading psychology books? Faster, faster. 1, 2! Let's start. Here. Come on. Go easy. There's something in here. Did the app tell you to do this, too? No, I told the app to do this. Adam, we have every confidence in your creativity. This "77 Heartwarmings" app that you created has been greenlit by our company. Whoever you want to hire for this, we have your back. Each of your answers has its own set of reasoning behind it. In my case, there's someone very special who changed my life. She taught me how to be more caring and understanding. She made me a better version of myself. The app's published! Yes! Congratulations, Adam! Thank you, guys. We've worked so hard on this. This app is gonna be a hit! I really want us to be together again. But that's not the only reason I developed the app. I want people who bury their heads in their phones to look up at the people beside them. I developed "77 Heartwarmings" to remind people how to love. Eva Lui. This guy may have moved you 77 times, but he hurt you 77 times before, too. Is this the so-called happy ending you want? Can I have a little more time? We've got plenty of time. Eva. Look.
