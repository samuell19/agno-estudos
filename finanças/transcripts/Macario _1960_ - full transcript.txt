the day of the dead is celebrated in Mexico in a unique way, because... ...Mexicans have a rooted sense of the dead. they make toys, bread and sugar ...skulls. they place an offering at their homes with flowers... and food, so they can eat and drink. the worship of the dead... ...comes from the natives, but during the 16th and 17th... ...centuries, their customs and believes were mixed with those... ...of christianity, so their rites and practices are a combination of... ...both cultures up to this day. MACARIO For whom is that candle? For your goodmother, Rosa. May she rest in peace. She was always very kind with us. And there won't be a candle for my dad? No, my child. thanks God your father is alive. this is only for the dead. At Mr. Narciso's they're mounting a big offering... As usual... they're so pretentious, even with the dead... ..we aren't. this is what we eat, this is what our dead eat. Are you back, Macario? Yes, I'm back. Please give these flower to your woman, for your offering. thank you. - Have a nice day. - Have a nice day, Macario. dad is coming! What did you bring to us? Later, later. I brought nice things. children, what are you doing? dad, dad! - Give me one, give me one. - Easy, easy... I brought lots of things for everybody. the baby first. there you are. Me, me. - A little bird. - It's so nice! - Is it to eat? - Not at all. Look, it's so nice. Our Father, who art in heaven, we thank you... ...for our food today. May we have it tomorrow. In the name of the Father... ...and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. I have finished, mom. that's not true. His mouth is full yet! I want more. - I want more. - So do l. can I have more? - Me too. - Give me more. - Please give some more? Eh, look! come here, it's so beautiful! Lots of food! the dead are going to eat everything? If I die, can I come to eat here? No, only rich dead people eat here. Ours eat at our offering. then, I'd better not come! Mom, can we go out to see the market? Yes my children, you can go, but behave... ...I'll be with you in a moment. Mom, if they don't behave, can I beat them? No, you can't. Good morning, chona. Good morning. It's 3 real. And why is that much? they sent many lace shirts from Mr. Ramiro. It's more expensive. You always find a way to overcharge. We'll hear Mme. Eulalia. Hey, tell her not to forget my dead's tip. Mme. Eulalia was saying that dead people are not pretext for money. Ask her anyway. - Good morning. - Hi Macario. come in, the sir is here. How do you do, Macario? Wait a moment. Because dead is giving us a lot of work today. So many candles, uh? And you see, they're not enough for today. dead are more than these. Aren't you going to buy yours? they're cheaper for you. No, thank you. that's too bad, Macario. We've got to be nicer with the dead... ...because we spend more time dead than alive. Anyway, we all are born to die. What do we earn here? A bust, and sometimes, no even that. Lots of work... ...many troubles. When we're born, we're carrying our death in the liver... ...or in the stomach... ...or here... ...in the heart, that one day will beat no more. It can also be outside... ...sitting under a tree... ...that hasn't grown yet... ...but that will fall on you when you're old. When we're born, we're carrying our death in the liver... ...or in the stomach... ...or here, in the heart... ...that one day will beat no more. It can also be outside... ...sitting under a tree... ...that hasn 't grown yet... ...but that will fall on you when you're old. dad, look at my skull. dad, I also want one. can you buy me the big one? I also want one, dad. I want many! I will buy them for you. they gave me my dead's tip. Wait for me at the cloister. I'm going to deliver the firewood. I prefer a sponge cake. - I want this one. - I prefer this one. - You want to many things. - I prefer this one. choose whatever you want. - Good morning. - How do you do, Macario? Hey, Mr. Alfredo... ...it's very late and I haven't got my bread yet! My dead are waiting since very early. It's delayed, please excuse us. But here we have a very special order from Mr. Ramiro. Bet not from Mr. Ramiro! He's got his own oven, so he has tasty home bread. But his oven draws bad... ...so he brought six turkeys to be cooked. He has important guests. So my bread won't be ready! It'll be ready later. Honest. O.K. What do you think of our turkeys, my friend? Our? Are they yours too? You'll see... ...those of us working with Mr. Ramiro, eat the same as him. We have very important guests today. dou you know who's coming? canon cristino Alatriste. Who is that one? Everybody knows him! He's...er.. Be careful, you're going to throw the juice. Get it in! Are going to give us the wood for free? What happens to him? He didn't even ask for a dead's tip. Be careful! Be very careful not to drop them because you'll have to pay. don't finish them. Leave me one. Leave one for me! What happens, Macario? Nothing. Go back to sleep. Macario... Macario, won't you eat anything? Kids have already eaten your part. But I reserved just a little when I noticed you weren't having lunch. If you don't go, they'll eat it as well. Let them eat it! Aren't you hungry? Hungry? Hungry? It's the way I've been all my life. Like you. Like my children. My only thought were to eat. We've been starving all of our lives. You saw those turkeys yesterday. I won't be starving slowly anymore. I'm going to die at once. I won't eat anything until I can... ...eat a turkey by myself. ...without sharing it. Not staying hungry to let others eat. Although the others... ...be my children. I want to eat by myself. All for me... All of it, and if not, I will never eat. I want to be full... ...not hungry... ...with the turkey's flavor in my mouth... ...not wanting another piece. Give the kids what you reserved for me... ...because I'll never eat again. Here you are, Macario come on Macario. take it. Give it to the children. - First me. - Me! the younger first. You wait here. Hasn't chona told you that I like skirts? Look at this! this is impossible! I ran out of starch.... ...and at the moment I had no money to buy more. don't expect to pay for them like this. take them away and bring them back properly. Mariquita, the last one... ...will go and see... ...if they live or die, to run away! She's dead! Run! Mariquita, the last one... ...will go and see... ...if they live or die, to run away! He's warm. You turn around, and run this way... ...and you see Milano eating parsley... ...he's not here, he's in his place... ...the rose is coming up and the carnation is fading away... She's dead! Macario! take this. You said you wanted just for yourself. I understand, Macario. I have also wanted something for myself. So I won't need to share it. Not even with you. But go away right now. Because if the children see it, they will want their part, won't they? come on... come on, Macario... take it now. Hey friend... the turkey you're about to eat looks so good. Are you going to invite me? I'm not your friend. And I'm not going to share it. Hey my friend... ...that animal looks so tasty... Let's make a deal. If you give me one leg, nothing else... ...I'll give you my silver spurs. What do I want a spur for? I don't have a horse. Well... ...I can give you some other thing... can you see the buttons on my trousers? they are made of gold. If you give me a slice of the breast... ...just a slice of the breast... I'll give you these coins. And what am I going to do with them? If I went to exchange them, they'd cut my hand for thief. A guy like me doesn't pay with gold coins. Go away, leave me alone! Well Macario, this deal is going to be a lot better. If you give me a wing... ...just a single wing... I'll give you this whole forest. All these trees will be yours... ...What do you say? What would I gain if I were the owner? I'd have to cut, carry and sell the wood, as I do today. Besides, you cannot give me this forest, because it's not yours... It's from God, our Lord. Hey man, do some charity for me. You, sir... ...want a piece?... Just a bite... ...if you want to share it. Why sir? Why? You're not interested on this bite. You're interested in a gesture... ...an action... ...you know that I hadn't wanted anything for me alone in my whole life. then this desire... ...for you is a dead animal. It's just an excuse to behave well. It's everything for me. All the hunger of my life. All that I have given. All that I haven't received. Forgive me. I know that you can forgive me if you want. I don't want to share it with you. I don't want to. But if you really want a bite... Friend, all that turkey is just for you? I'm very hungry. I've been hungry for quite a long time. It's been thousands of years since I last ate. can you share a bite with me? I knew that this couldn't be true... It was too much to ask. I'm going to share it with you. I'm going to cut it in the middle. Pick the one that you prefer. thank you very much. Some water? No, thanks. Very tasty! I can say that your wife cooks great. does it bug you if we talk? I speak so rarely to men. Rarely. We meet an instant and there's really nothing to say nor time to spend... can I ask you something? Why did you invite me? Because you were very hungry. It was quite clear. More than l, ever. that's why you invited me? Well, yes. Mainly because of that. And the first one who asked you... Why didn't you invite him? that one? Of course not! He wanted to fool me. Above all, if I didn't invite my children nor my wife. do you think that some spurs or some coins... ...worth more than my family's satisfaction? But, you know... ...the second one? Why didn't you invite him? He's the owner of everything that exists... ...of you...of everything. He only wanted a gesture from me. After inviting him, I'd have run full of repentance... ...to invite my family, and I had eaten almost nothing. And to me, why did you invite me? You said that mainly because of my hunger... ...or is it there any other reason? the truth... ...when I saw you I thought I wouldn't have time even for a bite. When you show yourself, there's no time for anything. then I estimate that if I gave you a half and we ate at the same time... ...while you ate, I'd ate too. You have invited me... I've been in the company of you... ...and I have even laughed a little. So I'm indebted to you and I'm going to reward you. I'm going to pay for your invitation at such a price as you never dreamed of. Now empty you container. Give it to me. Macario, this water can cure any illness. As long as I have no reason to impede the health of the sick. I give it to you. And think that no man has got the power I deliver in your hands. Watch the way you use it. If you visit a sick man, I'll always be by his side. When I'd be at the foot of his bed, give him a drop. A single drop of the water I'm giving you. Because that'll be enough to cure him. But if I'm at the top end... try nothing. He'll die. You don't believe me, do you? It's all right. I'll make that very soon... today, you'll have the chance to believe me. today? And be careful. don't spill a single drop, because I'll never give you more. And remember... If you see me at the foot of the sick... ...with a drop you'll give him health. ...and if I'm at the top end... try nothing. that person belongs to me. See you later, Macario. We may not talk again, but we'll see us often. And remember. Use my gift wisely. And be worthy of my friendship. there he is! Oh my God, he's cold. touch him! Please cover him! - He's already cold. Save him please. - Oh my God. My son... Son. My son... I saw him walking straight. As if he were conducted. and although I shouted, and ran... Poor mother. My son. talk to me son. talk to me. talk to me. We ought to get vulture broth... ...it's very good for this! No way! that's only good for rabies. Macario's coming! - Parents can predict things. - Yes, of course. He'll be able to close his eyes. Yes. Oh my God. - dad! - dad! My brother fell on the pit Go out! - I told you to go out! - No Macario! Leave me alone with him! Wait for me outside. Please don't move. Stay there. Mom, my dad's back! Are you going to serve the food? Waait for me at the cloister. I'm going to deliver the firewood to the bakery. So here's the woman of the healer. they have told me. things that people make up. When there's a gossip... Is it true that he only touched him and he cured him? there are people that have those gifts. But I haven't met any of them. tell your husband to cure Mme. Eulalia. She's so ill. She doesn't even shout nor tell off. She's really sick. I'll bring you the dirty clothes in a moment. Macario, now we know that you have healing gifts... tell me, is it true that you cured your son? - things people tell. - But why do they tell them? there's all the wood. You keep to yourself, don't you?... Mother, if you save Eulalia... ...I promise you a gold medal. And look, well... I promise you the medal... ...and a little gold crown, a little one, for your son... ...but save her. In the name of the Father... Macario, someone's coming. You're Macario, aren't you? - to serve God. - do you know me? - You're Mr. Ramiro. - I'm rich, Macario. My wife is ill. I don't believe stories, but the doctor has done all he could... My wife is covered with suckers... ...a hundred leeches sucked her blood, but she stays the same. they say you can cure and I don't believe it. Is it true that you can cure? It is true that I can sometimes cure... come with me to see her... If you cure her, I'm going to give you whatever you want. O.K. Wait for me there. I need to be alone with her, Mr. Ramiro. Alone? It's the only way that I can do something. I have to object as a doctor that this man obstructs the work of science. Please doctor, come this way. Mr. Ramiro! I can cure your wife. How much are you going to charge me? How much do you think her life worth? Well... ...I'll give you... ...I'll give you... ten gold ounces. that's the value of her life for you? I pay one ounce to the doctor. But I'm going to cure her. And how much do you want? I want... One hundred ounces. One hundred ounces! It's all right. I'll give them to you. But when she's completely cured. do you hear me? What time is it? It's..It's the dawn, sweet heart. Why are you awake? I'm very sleepy. You cured her! I told you I would. Well... I've got to pay. Of course. We've said... ...it was pretty expensive... Give me ten ounces. that'll be enough. I don't want your enmity, but your gratitude. take it. Here's your money. What are you doing, my husband? You haven't slept all night long. I'm planning business. Hey...do you remember who else is sick among our friends?... ...besides the ones I'm going to name... Mr. Manuel centeno de la Barrera, Mr. Jos? Luis torres Salazar.... ...count Francisco de Valderrama. Our Father, who art in heaven... ...thank you very much for our food today. May we have it tomorrow... ...the same! In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. How nice to see you. Please come in... I hope your father is not seriously ill. He's not my father. He's my grandfather. He feels very ill. But... ...you think he can be cured, of course. You praised your doctor so much that... Yes, but there's a limit. Of course, it is possible. Let's get him in. thank you. Boys! Be careful. He took my job away, and now you have it! What is his size? He needs to be alone. Please. What are you doing here? Who are you? Who the hell has got me in here? Why isn't here anyone from my house? Where the hell is everybody? Why do you look at me with such a stupid face? Get out of here! Get out right away! MAcARlO dO HlS BUSlNESS HERE. dON RAMlRO'S GUEStHOUSE. Ladies and gentlemen, open your eyes... ...and listen carefully ...pain, discomfort and groans are over... ...discomfort and groan.... ... they come quickly in carriages... ...because everybody is in a rush... ...if they want a place to be cured by Macario... ... to be cured by Macario. He 's cured many rich people, but at God's willing... ...money worth nothing.... ...rich people also die, rich people also die. Thhe doctor and the carpenter win... Thhe widow cries afflicted, she 's going to lose all her money... ...she 's going to lose all her money. Macario doesn 't allow it, because he 's an honest man... He gives it back to the widow, and it's well done ...it's well done. Look at Macario's wealth. He's won my boss. Well, not that much, but you can see the change. How much would he paid? Of course, he cures only rich people! that's not true. Macario cures everybody. And he charges whatever they want to pay. My grandfather had only a pig... -...and that's all he paid. - that's true... ...I gave him only a dozen eggs... I would have given him the hen, but he didn't want her. He accepted my goat. I didn't have another, and he ate it in barbecue. But you can see I'm good as new! Not that new! thank you boys. the one in the corner. So Macario cures miraculously. He's a sorcerer, isn't he? He's not a sorcerer. It happens that Holy Virgin guides him... ...tells him how to cure. No Virgin at all. It's the archangel Gabriel. You think Holy Virgin would bother to come? that's what archangels are for...to help her. I haven't smell incense when Macario passes by. Furthermore, the opposite. And what's the smell? Sulphur? He smells like a person, like sweat. Very funny, isn't it? - the last rites. - the extreme unction. Who is going to die? those rites are for an old lady that came ill yesterday. But Macario has already told her that she's a hopeless case. So he also knows who's going to die and who doesn't. He does. - He's very wise, isn't he? - Fortune-teller! - Who are those men in black? - they've been sent by the Holy Office. the lnquisition! Mon, mom! She's not here. Let's go! Mom, mom.... dad, dad! dad, dad... dad... this is abundance. So many things! You've been thinking well, very well... You've got to have a stock. I didn't think about it. It was Macario. Very well done. Well done. You never know, and since God is helping you. Yes. I hope it's God. Of course it's God. Who else? Mom, mom! I'm here. Mom, we didn't find my dad, nor anybody. Help us find him. Yes children. Let's go. - I'll be back soon, chona. - Go on, don't worry about me. I prefer the other house because we didn't get lost there. Where are you, my woman! - Where is everybody? - Here. - Why do you hide? - We don't hide, we got lost. dad, dad! take it. I'm going to see the sick. I'm so afraid! Let's go with mom! - I'm afraid. - We'd better go with mom and dad. Let's go. Mom, I'm so afraid! Mom! I'm not opposed that you arrest him and take him to the city. But Macario has brought wealth and health to town... ...there will be a riot to defend him! We can wait and ask for forces. How big can that riot be? the whole town! It may be the whole country, we'd crush it! Beating and killing people? It seems that you don't agree the Holy Office. No, no, never... It's only that he's just been accused, and he can be innocent. that man out of hell is guilty with no doubt. Out of hell? Maybe... But the church never had so many candles... ...and alms as today. Well, if you need to arrest him, it would be wise to do it in secret. catch him carefully, by surprise, to avoid a slaughter. Wife! Wife! Keep this. But keep it safe. What is it? It's our family health. Macario. Why you have you never told me who taught you how to cure? Where do you get the water from? All of this... ...the house, so many things. I'm afraid, Macario. You watch your children... ...and do the house work. Everything else is your husband's. Macario... Why don't we go back to the other house? MAcARlO dld BUSlNESS HERE Easy! Why are you doing this to us? So you'll learn what's the authority. You two keep on searching. Get out! Open it! But sir, what have we done? You are sorcerers, blasphemers and heretics. come on. But sir, why do break it? Here's the key. Law doesn't need keys. come on, open it! Break those bottles. It doesn't seem sane what you're saying, Macario. Remember that if you're discovered lying by this court... We can get the truth by means of torture. I swear sir that I have told the whole truth. When did you start to cure the sick? I have already said so, sir. the first one was my son... How did you know how to cure him? When you walk on the mountain, you learn many things. If we went to the mountain with you, would we learn to cure too? It would depend on you and not me what you learn, sir. Isn't it the devil who taught you how to cure, Macario? No, sir, it's not the devil. I'd say that it was God, our lord. And maybe even the Holy Virgin. And how could you know who is going to die and who isn't? You learnt that on the mountain too? I'd say that I learnt that with the sick themselves. When you practice, there's no possible mistake. Where do you notice it? In the eyes? In the feet and in the head, sir. Officer! the prisoner must wait outside! We're going to deliberate. If this man is a charlatan... ...the punishment will only be to cut his tongue... ...and pillory him for one week. But if he has a pact with the devil... ...the torment and he'll be burnt at the stake. that's why I believe it's very important to clearly define... ...if he's a charlatan or a sorcerer. there's a test that has come to my mind... A test? - What is it about? - It's very easy. Some of our prisoners are ill, aren't they? true. the blasphemous Jewish is dying. Well, let's put all the sick in a cell... ...and we'll put in there a healthy one as well. A soldier or the executioner... ...the executioner is very healthy. And Macario should tell us what is going to happen. that way we'll know if he's either a charlatan or a sorcerer. Very good idea. Excellent, isn't it? We can also include the condemned person that will be executed tomorrow. that's true. Give the instructions. - Are here all the sick? - All of them. Well, I have reserved these two beds. One is for the condemned person. Get him here. You are going to be on the other. don't make me lie here! I want nothing with sorcerers. come on, don't be stupid. What can he do to you? If I knew, I wouldn't be afraid. Please leave me in my job. I only know how to torture and hang people, and I do that well. If you want it, I can fill the sorcerer's ears with lead... ...but I don't want to be lying here, alone with him Stop your sobbing! take that hood out an lie down! Let them know that everything is ready. I'm sweating... ...and my heart is beating as if it were to explode! Please don't do this to me! Shut up and obey! You're shaking, sweating and you're pale... that's good. You look sicker than the other. Have mercy on me! If you're keep on like this, you'll have a reason to cry. He's asked to be alone with the sick. It's the only way his wisdom comes out. We'll please him. Let's leave him alone. Not this one? Nor this one that looks so bad? Not anyone? Anyone what? Anyone what? this one! I will. Me, what? What about me? Sirs, I can tell you, sirs. Well Macario, we're waiting for your diagnosis. - We'll see the surprise! - Let's see. Everybody is going to live, but one. I've already said so! charlatan! Of course the dying one will die. Everyone will live, except that one. See who he's chosen. You'll lose your tongue, Macario. We won't need to burn him. Even the condemned person will live? tell the dying one to get up! He's dead! His heart stopped beating. this is heavy! I bring a pardon from His Excellency. the condemned person will only be in prison for life. A pardon. He's given a pardon so he can pray from his cell... ...for the health of the son of His Excellency the Viceroy... ...who is very ill. Out of hell! truly from hell! He is a sorcerer with no doubt. He knew it exactly. And the dying one was pretending to avoid torment. He was healthy. It's strange. It's a miracle, sir. Miraculously, the Holy Virgin! I trust the power of the Holy Office. the works of the devil are false. that's what they are, hoaxes. My husband... I'm impressed. they have told me about a miraculous man with powers over life and dead. You too, my wife? It's too much! I would have believe from a peasant, but.. I'm a mother and l see my son dying. My lady, Viceroys can't have anything to do with devil's sorcerers. Our prestige is jeopardized. I don't care about prestige! I care about my son's life. We must bring that man. He won't come. then I'll look for him to his cell wit my son in my arms... ...and will see how prestige is endangered more. Oh my God! Macario. Macario, why are you in chains? this cell... How did you manage to get in and see me? I took what we had hidden... ...and I've given to these people. And our children? they are at chona's. Because... ...the soldiers broke into our house... ...they destroyed everything... ...they spilled your medicine... It doesn't matter any more. they are going to do the same to you? Well, you see... ...you mustn't believe that they'll burn me... ...that won't be true.... ...nor that I'll be tormented. It is sure that it won't happen. No, Macario, no. Macario, come with me. the Viceroy's son is very ill. You'll have the chance to cure him. If you cure him, you'll be very lucky. You can be the doctor at the court. How am I going to cure him if l don't have any more medicine? You spilled it. If that boy could be saved... ...there's no medicine You'll find a way. Follow me! Macario... ...our health you said, I brought it with me. Well, what are you waiting for? Where is the ill boy, sir? can't you hear the mother's sobbing? come on, get in at once! Excuse me, sir... ...I've got to see him alone. As you wish. But remember, you'll be pardoned if you save him. torment and fire if he dies. My friend... ...this cannot be... ...you can't take this one away... ...don't you know that I'll be tortured and burnt if you take him? What are you doing there? Go to the other side! I ask it remembering that turkey. Go to the other side... Let him live... But you got me into this. I didn't ask for it! I can do nothing. It's a Supreme Order. think on my children when they see me burning. And think on me! ...Still alive, but burning and screaming! Let me cure him. Please, my friend. You have called me friend. ..show me that you are. Let me cure him. Let him live. Open the door, please. Is the boy cured? Open the door! Help me! Help me! How do you do, Macario? You're just in time. And as usual, I'm ready to help you. See how mistaken you were about your guest. If I were the invited one, nothing would have happened to you. come, and I'll show you how to be a winner. come on, hurry up! I've already told you that I don't want your help! Go away, leave me alone, I've had enough! And besides you! It's again you, my lord... don't leave them reach me, my lord. It's you who pull them, Macario. Your deeds follow you... don't run anymore and face them. think about saving your part that doesn't die. think about you. think about your deeds. Weight them and judge them. I've got to run, my lord. I've got to run. Welcome to my cavern, Macario. Hide me. they're going to reach me. Why did you betray me? I haven't betrayed you... And I'm with you more than ever. this is a place that no man has seen yet. there are things here that you should learn. come. Look Macario. this is mankind... You can see lives burning quietly... Sometimes the winds of war or the winds of plague blow... ...and lives extinguish by milliards randomly... the high ones... ...the small ones... ...the right ones... ...the twisted ones. Now there is peace. Look at them burning. Each one is made of different wax. Each one is unique. they last depending on the material the flame is burning... can you see this stub of a candle? this is the life of the Viceroy's son. You can see it here. A life. You can see how fragile, how delightful and how brief it is. Like a butterfly from eternity. And you've been playing and trading with this... ...and you never understood the significance of the gift I gave you. Look at this flame! the Viceroy's son is dead now. Why did you do that? It was the time. there's a supreme order. ..there are laws. there are many things that you don't understand. And what about my candle? Where is my candle? I want to see it. - It's extinguishing! - Yes. Aren't you going to do anything? Are you going to let it extinguish? there's an order, Macario. But you can! there are many candles extinguished! don't let it extinguish. Everything has its end and its place. We can't do nothing. don't touch it! I know what you're going to do. It's in vain, Macario. Who do you what to escape from? From me? From you? come back! It's the moment to rest and be judged. A story ends, and another one starts. When the deeds of mankind finish... It's because the judgement is going to begin. Macario, don't run anymore. What for? Macario, Macario, Macario! Macario! He's never back this late. Always at sunset. He went out so happily today. Macario! Macario! Macario! Macario! He's here! He's sleeping. Macario. Macario. You were like a child. With your whim. I am so glad. to have given you that whim. Life wasn't easy, Macario. But it was good to have lived it together. Macario... I'm going to make our children to be like you. Good men. He couldn't even finish his turkey. the End. translated by: Juan J.
