I'm worried. Don't you think he's a little old? Oh. Well, all of his vitals are healthy. It's guaranteed. You know this better than I do, but the young ones aren't always better. Am I right? What's taking you so long? Let me help you with that. The client is waiting. There we go. How long have you been in this business? Long enough, sir. Long enough. Have any regrets? Hmm, of course. But I have since, uh, changed my mindset about it. Because I've learned in all my years that regret does nothing but stand in the way of success. Right, Mr. Bob? Am I right? That's true. Hey, nurse, what's taking so long? Can you do this? Pay attention! Where's the scalpel? This is the scalpel. It doesn't have to be sterile. The important thing is to be fast. See the line right here.

Just get in, you! ♪ Welcome to my paradise ♪ ♪ Where this sky so blue ♪ Just relax. First of all, I'm sorry. Miss? It's not the first time that this has ever happened, you know? Men are a disappointment. I really do understand... Understand what? Understand that you, miss, I mean ma'am... I understand that you are a cop. - Don't you mess with me again. - Yes, yes. Yes, of course. And Dina? Yeah, I'm late as it is. Wait, your hair. Hold on. - There you go. - A bit to the right. Uh-huh. - Okay. - All right. - Thank you, kids. - Wanna move to the front? Pelor, wanna move to the front? Sleepyhead. What the... Hey, that's my spot! And kids? Today was... great. Thanks, Pops. Din. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... One, two, three. Sorry, but can you move a bit closer to your father? Closer. Until you're touching him. Okay, that's nice. One, two, three. Bigger smile. Like... Yeah, that's right. Don't look so grumpy. Yes, that's right. Keep smiling, sir. One, two, and three. Nice one! Nice one! - Dad. - Yeah? You can't do this. You can't always bribe me like this. You understand? With fritters. What am I supposed to do? I can't leave my job, Dina. I was late because I had to finish it to attend your inauguration tomorrow. What's the job this time? Are you gonna tell me? Well, you know. The usual. Cleaning up a mess. - What's wrong? - I'm full, Dad. How come? I'm fed up with your lies. You're always like this. You're never on time. Can you be honest for once? - That's not it, Din. - Then what is it, Dad? Dina, you have to understand. There are many things I can't tell you. Whatever, Dad. Honestly, I don't care, because it's always been like this. - Din... - You wanna be honest or not, up to you. I'm really fine, Dad. Don't worry about it. - Dina. - Yes. What now, Dad? Din, come on, don't be like that, okay? Hey. Tomorrow, everything will change, okay? And what will change, Dad? We'll write page one of The adventures of Dina and Dad, okay? - I'm tired. - Hey, Dina. Din! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Tell me, what's the theme of this car, huh? Well, it is what it is, Pops. Just trying to spice up this junk. Okay, okay, okay. - What's that? - Padang. We feast today, kids. - Thank you so much, Pops. - Alpha, let's eat. Just a minute, Pops. Good evening. I'm Ainanisa. Live with breaking news. A shocking incident occured at the Syarief Family Foundation orphanage, claiming many lives. Even more shocking is the revelation that the well-respected philanthropist, Syarief, is now suspected as the leader of a human organ trafficking syndicate. This has claimed the lives of numerous victims, especially those of orphan minors taken in by the Syarief Family Foundation. Is there any speculation as to who's behind Syarief's murder? Someone like him has many enemies, but this I promise. I will do everything in my power to find and uncover whoever is responsible for this crime. I don't care. I will arrest these vigilantes. In our jurisdiction, no one... Why'd you turn it off? I've already told you that one day I will be retiring, right? You're all grown up now. You've been trained well. Uh, but sir... I have made my decision, Topan. Why would you even retire? You're gonna stay at home? Growing bonsai trees? When our missions were getting exciting. I don't even know what my role in the team is. I don't know how to fight, how to shoot a gun. I do nothing but be the bait. Son, listen to me. Someday you will find yourself. - Find what? - He doesn't know. Don't retire now. It's Dina, isn't it? You're right, Alpha. We complete our missions to success. Yet, we rarely ever felt like winners. That seems to be our lot in life. Killers are paid to kill, after all. Even though, true, we only kill those who deserve it and... - Uh, yes, can I say something real quick? - Shh. You all know this very well, right? Ironically, the name "The Big 4" came from our very enemies, and there is no shortage of them. That's exactly the reason why I have trained each of you to be the best. Dina doesn't have what we have, she just doesn't. She only has me, her dad. My gosh, what do we have here? How many times do I have to tell you, Topan... Why now? It's just so sudden, Pops. Topan... You're the only one who knows about my friendship with Hassan. Yes, I know, you've told me this many times. Imagine. I am a criminal. Hassan, my best friend, is a law enforcer. Dina, my only daughter, who I love more than anything in this world, is closer to him. Tomorrow she's officially a police officer. My life's complicated, isn't it? I just hope that she can live in peace, Topan. - I understand. - Very good. I was just wondering... - What's next for Petrus, then? - Oh, you see this? - Bersi. - Bersi! You're too old, Pops. Why do you think I've been saving money all this time, huh? Every single coin. Someday, it is my wish to return to Bersi, bring all of you, and work together like we always have, eh? Topan, let's open a new chapter in our lives, okay? - You've raised me, Pops. - Attaboy. Wherever you decide to go, I'll follow you. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to Bersi Villa. Please allow me to take your luggage. Go ahead. I'll follow you. Don't worry about anything And here we go. Okay, kiddo? INAUGURATION CEREMONY POLICE CRIMINAL RESERVE AGENCY Tell me what's wrong. Is your father late again? Sorry, but what father? Please don't be like that. - Mr. Petrus. - Hey, good morning. How are you, huh? I'm fine, ma'am. - Where have you been? - Nowhere. Is that so? You see, a flower courier came by. Oh, yeah, yeah. I ordered those flowers for Dina, ma'am. - Today's her inauguration. - Is that so? Okay. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? - Where do you want me to put this? - Oh, just put it over there by the door. - Okay. - Thank you. Don't worry, your father will come. One more thing. Don't call me Uncle at the office. Call me sir or commander. Yes, sir. Yeah. These flowers are something else. There we go. Ooh. This is a huge one. Mr. Petrus. That's very clever of you. You caught me off guard. Using the enemy's known weakness as a distraction. You yourself taught me this. So it is you. Now, quit wasting time. What's your business here? You're paying respects? No, sir. That's not what I want. METRO POLICE Hands up! I said hands up! Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Wake up, Dad. Wake up, Dad! A violent crime that resulted in death occurs once again in Jakarta. A middle-aged man was reported being brutally killed in his neighborhood. We learned that the victim of the shooting was found by his daughter, who is, ironically, a newly inaugurated officer under the command of Capt. Hassan Pratama. I will be turning you over now to our on-site reporter for further details. - What are we gonna do now? - Thank you, Ainanisa. Good evening... We're outta here. Where are we gonna go? CCTV FOOTAGE REPORT Ouch... METRO POLICE Dina. Yes, Commander? Commander. Sit down, Dina. These are yours. And theirs. The way you work is making the others seem lazy. You haven't taken a leave since... the case of your father? Working keeps me sane, sir. Ah. My wife likes to slide these in my briefcase. But I think you need a holiday more than I do. I don't need it. Or maybe you should pick a partner, and you work together on the reports. Take it. Paranais Villa... POLICE REPORT Shit! It shattered. Oh... Fuck! Dina. They're most likely just some village kids. Nothing to worry about. Don't tell me you're being serious, sir. They can't be some village kids. Look. The cap the killer wore that night is right there. See? - It's my father's cap. - So? He must've stolen it. That's all. Uncle, listen to me! The killer took that cap! Din. Bersi is not your jurisdiction. But mark my word. - I will solve your father's case... - It's three years since he was murdered! If not now, then when? You promised me you'd have my back. I'm asking you to make good on that. - But it's not that simple, Dina. - Okay. - I'll take a leave. - What? Just say that I'm on vacation, relaxing. Looking for enlightenment. Din. Yes, Uncle? Excuse me, Commander. I brought the report... I'll take that leave. Oh, that's good. Effective tomorrow, sir. Excuse me, sir. Yes, that's good. Excuse me, Commander. I have the report regarding... - Rudha. - Yes, Commander. - You told her to take a leave? - Yes, that's right, Commander. Shh! Shh! Shh! - Don, calm down, Don. - Antonio! Stop it already! You crazy shit! I trusted you, you traitorous dog! Blame yourself, Don. You've trusted a man with a scorpion on his back. And you're calling me a dog? You have destroyed me, Antonio... Don. You've seen how all your men were slaughtered by my secretary. What makes you think that you stand a chance? Hmm? Hey. There are two things in this world that I'm absolutely crazy about. The first one... salsa. And second... Don, Don. Calm down, calm down. Calm down, Don. You see, if hell does exist, - we'll see each other again. - Check this out, Alo. You need to take this. You're no fun. Hello? Yeah, what? Report! We've taken Don's turf, sir! The traffic was really bad, so we had to... Okay. Shit, Lengko, Lengko. What time is it, huh? You're ex-military. You're supposed to be punctual, right? Pick up all my knives. Yes, boss! So, good news? Depends. Do you like beaches? Clean it, and don't scratch it. Yes, boss! Pick up the knives! And don't scratch them! BERSI ISLAND BERSI ISLAND AIRPORT TAXI Take me to Paranais Villa. - Excuse me. - Wait, wait. Sir. Where are you going? Welcome to the villa called Paranais, where everything is nice. How can I help you? Why did you run? For my uniform. So listen, Mr. Topan... Wait. How do you know my name? I thought because of my reputation. - What do you mean? - Look. Yeah... Actually, I came here because I'm looking for someone. My father, right here. Have you seen him or perhaps know of anyone who... - This man. Have you? - No. How about these kids here? I don't have kids. I mean, have you seen them somewhere in the area, Mr. Topan? Nope. Okay, I'll stay here tonight. Maybe tomorrow you'll remember something. We're fully booked. Okay. Okay. Hmm? I'm not bribing you. I'm staying. Sorry, miss. The hotel is closed. I'll tell you what I can do. I'll get you a cab... Listen, is it just me or are you that eager to get rid of me? So aggressive. So heavy. What's in here, miss? Clothes. I would have guessed a bag full of sin. Enough. Sure you want to stay here? - I'm sure. - Okay. So was my father a regular here, Mr. Topan? I told you, I don't know him, miss. All right then, Mr. Topan. Just let me know if you remember anything. Did you come here alone, miss? Yes, alone. Why? No reason. That's my dog. He passed away. From what? Heartbreak, sadly. Brought any ID? - What for? - Registration. - Will you return it? - Yes. Hey, what was the dog's name? - Hassan. - Ah. Hello, welcome. You have a reservation? - Reservation, my ass! - So grumpy... - We're fully booked, sir. - Fully boo... Fully booked, my ass! - Don't fuck with us! - Calm down, man. Just calm down. Mister, did a lady stop by here? This tall? - Exactly, yeah. - Yes, that's right! Short hair, beautiful, determined face? - Yes! - Yes, that's right! Nope. Are you fucking with us? Where is she? Gosh. Don't be so rough, sir. Just chill... What's with the radio? Oh gosh, that really hurts. I'm sorry. Gosh, I don't know, mister. - I'm really sorry. - This is a new shirt. Gross. Just calm down... Wait, mister, wait. Don't do it, Mister. Sorry! Sorry, I didn't mean to do it! Don't do it, Mister. Forgive me. I'm sorry! That's enough. Just stop! Just stop, please! Oh, I'm so sorry, Mister! Listen, stop! Please don't do this, sir! - Mr. Topan? - Yes, miss? Is this villa owned by a local? Yes! Who's the owner? My father, miss! Sorry, man! Wait. Wait! Ow! Mr. Topan! Mr. Topan! Uh. If it's all right, can I meet your father? Sorry, but my father passed away, miss. - Oh! I'm sorry! - Yeah... - What are you doing? - It's itchy... Oh. Okay. What now, asshole? Are you Big Pour? - Big Pour? - Hey. It's not Big Pour. The Big 4. With an F. - With an F, right? - With a P. Like pee... Whatever, asshole! - Hold it. - Where are the others, huh? I have no idea. Calm down. But that chick knows, am I right? Mr. Topan! I need to talk to you right now! Fuck this Yes? What's wrong, miss? - Why, what is it, miss? - Three years ago. Yeah, so what? You've only started working here three years ago, right? Hmm. 2019 CALENDAR Correct? Yes. What's wrong with that? This is my father. He died three years ago. You have a photo of him. Care to explain? - Okay! - What? Well, he's my father too! - Huh? - Yeah. You're in this picture, am I right? Explain it to me right now, Mr. Topan. - You remind me of my past. It's sad. - So? Give me some space! - Explain it to me first. - No. Give me some space. You don't wanna see me cry. So give me some space! Oh, I... The trauma is returning. I don't want to cry in front of you, so please. I beg you, miss... Get out. So, what does this mean, huh? We do not know each other, but you and I have the same father? Is that it? Well, he took care of me since I was little. It makes sense now. His constant absence. He was never around most of the time. And this is why. Did you know that he was murdered? He didn't deserve to go so horribly like that... Oh please, could you stop with all the lies? Your Javanese is obviously a put-on. It's fake, right? This place had just opened three years ago. Why? - Answer me! - Am I a suspect now? Listen, you guys closed this case when you failed to find his killer. Now you're here opening old wounds. Let us live in peace. Wait, us? - Nothing. - I heard what you said. You said "us". - So the other kids are still here? - I don't know their whereabouts. Okay, fine. I'll find them myself! What makes you think they'll entertain you anyway? - Better than you have, I expect! - Dina. The point is, I want to find my father's killer! Do you understand? - Please wait. - What is it? It hurts... I'll take you. Please wait. Keep an open mind. You see, Jenggo, he's special. Meaning? You're eager to see him, huh? Wear it. Against mosquitos. Ah. So be in the moment. In his Love Hut, Baba Jenggo teaches the lesson of harmony. There's no violence in the Love Hut, and both, and body, and even in words, in here, we serve everyone a potion to eliminate any negative aura. Please drink it, Mina. - Dina. - Ah, right. Why did you bring her, asshole? It's been years, and you're calling me an asshole. You were already an asshole even before that. You're getting good at hustling these tourists. Moringa leaves as magical cures? - She know about us? - Only what she needs to know. - She's being followed by gunmen. - Did you say gunmen? Shh. Calm down. And you brought her here? Are you planning to destroy my business? Hey, I built this empire with my blood and tears. Like hell you're screwing this up just because of that woman. I get it now. No wonder you were all smiles earlier. This is a breakthrough for you. Usually your negative aura kills the whole... She's trying to dig out things about Pops.

What are you worried about? - She's still pretty... - Ahh! So noisy! So, my dead father only adopted children who were talented. - Athlete. - Athlete? - Yeah, yeah. - What sort? - Judo. - Hmm. - Archery. - Shooting. Shooting an arrow. Shooting an arrow.

Hey, hey, hey, hey Can we please just focus on our main problem here? There are gunmen out there after Dina! Focus! Focus! My third eye has been twitching since yesterday. - You told him to bring a gun? - Hey! Dina, Topan. Think about it! Do I have to think of everything? What should we do now? Yeah, you're right. Just let me think. I'll figure something out. - We'll keep Dina safe. - Agreed. I promised Pops I would take care of Dina. - We all promised to take care of her. - Yeah... - Yeah. - Hey! I have an idea. - Let's tell Dina everything. - Idiot! - Dumbass! - But why? She's also Pops' kid. Why can't she be told... That's why you shouldn't carry a gun! 'Cause you're naive! You just don't understand how real life works! You hear me? She's a police offi... ...cer. Hello? Oh! Bro, Dina's missing! - We see that, idiot! - I'm just telling you. - Talking back to me? - Jenggo, Pelor... - What? - Don't you talk back to me! - But I'm only trying to help. - Watch out! - Who are they? - Get down!

Wake up, Pelor! Pelor! - I'm awake. Hey, Pelor, I'll distract them while you run away! What about you, huh? We're in this together, right? Listen, if we die together here, I will be killed by Alpha! - That makes no sense if we both die. - No matter, I ain't dying twice. Are you sure? I'm sure it'll be okay. Hey, Pelor. Hey, I'm the second oldest brother. My duty is to protect you. Stay calm. I'm going to beat their ass off. When we were little, I always protected you. Now is no different, I'll... Pelor, you coward.

Saying my name, Jenggo, Jenggo, Jenggo! Enough, or you'll wear it out! Let me teach you a lesson. What do you want? I've since retired peacefully. I'm enjoying my life here. You come here, disturbing my peace. You'll feel my anger. Chakra. Oh, my. I thought we were supposed to be retired. What the hell is going on then? I don't like this! - Hey! Stop, you rat! - Spare me, please spare me... Mama... Shit, I got no mama... Look what we have here. This one's not important. Kill him. - Mama... I wish I had a mama. - Hey! Stop it! Hey! Hey! Hey, you! Peace... Stay down, don't move! Walk. Stop resisting. - How does it feel? - Let my brother go! - Topan! - Nobody touch him, he's mine! Show some respect. Get your feet off his head. Worrying about your friend with no concern for your own life. - That's why you're Petrus' favorite. - Who are you? Petrus, he never told you about me? Everything was about you. Topan... The Big 4... You bastard, how could you? You shot one of your own! You're not human! - You know what? I'd rather be an animal. - Because humans are... weak! Come on, do it, shoot! Shoot! Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot. You don't have the guts. Topan! Topan! Listen to me! - What is it? - Don't leave me, okay? So disappointing. - Yeah, that's right. Get ready. - Fucking asshole. What a bunch of clowns. I'm ready to die. You are not! This is Petrus' best son? Yeah, I'm Petrus' son. But I'm Petrus' first son, and I will always be number one. Topan, get away from here! You could say that I'm your big brother. You should be proud of that. I'm handsome, good at salsa. Do you really think that you guys are the only pupils that he had? Hey! Hey! Stop it! That's enough! Of all Petrus' children, it's obvious I'm the most efficient. No! Hey! Hey! So why do you think he cast me away? Do you know why? Answer! You killed father. Tell me why. It's personal. But relax. Your siblings will soon join you. And as for Dina, my men will take turns with her. Every single one of them. Well. - Bastard! - Give my regards to Father, the asshole. Farewell, Topan. Until we meet again. Pantura? HEARTBROKEN - Sis! - What? - Get the bazooka. - What's that? - Get the bazooka! - Where is it? Is this it? - Hurry, sis! Hurry, move it. - Wait, damn it! You got it backwards! Wrong end. Wrong end! Hey! Point it upwards towards the sky! She's gonna kill all Bersi's monkeys. - Which one? It won't shoot... - The "sun burst" button, sis... Uh, Alo? Oh fuck! Alo? Alo! Alo, where's Topan? Where's Topan? They mustn't get away! Find them! Now! Find them! Topan, you asshole! Let's go. It's like shooting for a TV-show. - Keep running! - You wanna be a YouTuber? Topan! - Hurry, get in! - Little bro, wait for us! Little bro! - Topan, watch out! Get down! - Fuck! - Hurry up, big bros! - Get in, get in, quick! That she-bitch. Run! Go, Pelor! Go! Faster, faster, faster! Faster! - Watch out! Get down! - Faster, Pelor! Pelor! Mama! Pelor! The weapon! Underneath you! Who is he? Hey, hey! Hey! Duck! Bastardo! Bastardo! I'll kill you all! Hang in there. It should be treated with alcohol. This liquor cleanses the wound. But afterwards, you drink some to numb the pain. CONCENTRATED CLEANING LIQUID - Oh, uh, sorry, but we've run out of it... - That's okay. Let me do it. - I'll get some water. - Yeah. You know what? From the very beginning, all you did was lie to me. All these wounds, and you're still conscious. Who are you really? There's no easy answer. Hands up! Topan. Three years ago, at my father's home, you were right there. He was so helpless, dying on the floor, then he stopped breathing in my arms! He's dead because of you! Murderer! Murderer! - You killed my father! Why? - Hey! What's wrong? My seed sac... Shit! What's going on? What happened? Hey, sis! Hey, sis! - Dina! - Hey, Pelor! Pelor! Hey, sis! Dina! - What do you want? - Where are you going? - This road is dangerous! - Shut up! shut up! We're all Pop Petrus' kids. Please trust us. And how can I trust you, huh? You're liars, all of you! And Topan is nothing but a murderer, right? Watch your mouth, sis! That's impossible. Topan would never kill Pops! Never! You hear me? He'd gladly give his life for him, for all of us. We're family! If that were true, then why are you guys lying to me, hmm? Ah. Let's go and see Alpha. She's also Pops' kid. She'll explain everything. Too late. Because I want to go to the police station! Oh, please don't. You'll doom all of us if you do that... Hey, hey, sis. Sis. Listen. I'm not a thug, nor a liar, okay? Please believe me. Look into my eyes. Because the eyes, they never lie. I never lied... And are you sure this Alpha won't lie to me, hmm? Our sister Alpha, sure, she may be explosive, but I know her. She never lies. Come on. Get in here. She'll explain everything. - What is it? - Nothing. I'm just cleaning it up. I didn't tell you to destroy the entire Bersi island but to kill The Big 4. Control yourself. Chill. I'm pretty sure that Pelor is taking your crush to meet Alpha. Don't think about that. Better think about your fighting skills. You're getting rusty! You lost to that mustache jerk. Imagine if he shaved that thing. I'm glad your jokes are lousy. 'Cause it hurts when I laugh. He killed father. - He killed father? - Shh. Shut up. Shh. He killed father? Uh, I think he's responsible for his death. Then we have to find him, right? We will hunt him down and avenge father's death! Where do we start? - Bunglon! - Bunglon! Topan, I'm a little worried. Should we be dealing with him? He's sneaky! He stole Siska, didn't he? He's a crafty crook! But you learned everything from him. Hey. Hey, stop! - Hey, boss! - Hey, stop. Stop. Stop. - Hey! - Watch out. Stop. Throw a rock at them if it doesn't stop! - Hey, come on, don't leave me. - Oh, sorry. I thought he was going to leave us. Sir, wait for us! Pops. Take care of Dina. Take care of her. And you. Dad? Hey, Dad? Dina! Wow! Hey, Dina! - It's me. Sorry - You're so annoying! It's about to begin. Let's go! Hey. ♪ I'm a woman ♪ ♪ I'm also a sunset mermaid ♪ ♪ I'm a woman ♪ ♪ I'm also a sunset mermaid ♪ Fuck! Shit! Fuck! - Hi, gramps. - Hi there, Alpha. ♪ But I yearn to be a songstress ♪ ♪ Adored by everyone ♪ ♪ Left and right, we're indulging ♪ ♪ I'm the sunset mermaid ♪ ♪ I yearn to be a songstress ♪ ♪ Adored by all men ♪ ♪ Yearn to be a songstress ♪ Yearn to be a songstress. Gramps, I yearn to be a songstress. - Oh, you yearn to be a songstress? Wow! - Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. It's a deal then. A safe route for my merch. A deal's a deal. We've already agreed on that. Okay, okay, okay. But remember, you have to come and shake your fins, okay? No problem. Thank you, gramps. What's she doing here? Long story, sis. It was just like an action movie. So it started when I went to... Topan, hold on. What if Bunglon has sided with the enemy? He's loyal to Petrus. Go on, get in there. Wait. Something's fishy. Maybe he's already dead. Nobody wants to deal with him. - My instinct says danger awaits. - At least we tried. Out of my way, basta... Bunglon? It's Topan and Jenggo. You fucking lost child. You show your faces, but when you do, you bring your shit with you. You guys fucked up this island. That's right. So why don't you and I have a talk about it? Antonio Sandoval. - You guys know him? - We don't. You've been civilians for too long. Made you both stupid. You're saying these are his men? Plenty of these punks wanna be on his payroll. He's known as the biggest arms dealer in the entire Southeast Asian region. But sadly for them, they fucked up when they messed with me. - What's your problem with him? - Nothing. - Nothing. - An old debt? I never owe anyone. I get owned all the time, so no. This is about Petrus. Petrus, even in death, you're leaving a mess. The Scorpion of Southeast Asia. TARGET: ANTONIO If he wants you to die, you die. Yet here we are, alive. Can you tell us why he's hunting us down? Topan said he killed father. Is that true? Who did it, Pops? Who did this? Suranto... Suranto. Suranto. Ever heard that name? Hey. One by one, Topan. We're still on this guy. - Who is he... - Shh! Stay right here. And don't steal my merch. All right, here we go. Hey, those are our records. Petrus asked me to create your identities. You were the first one. But before you... - Who is this little ghoul? - Suranto. Do you honestly believe that Petrus only trained the four of you? This one came before all of you. Let me borrow this. Hey. My place is a mess. I need compensation! - Yeah? So take my Love Hut by the forest. - Your tourist trap? Here. There's no harmony left in Bersi. Hey. I heard Antonio's men say they found Alpha's location. You know, you could've told us that earlier! Old prick! That's a matter of life and death! Topan! Yesterday you're a fraud, now you're a thief? Karma! He stole Siska, remember? You've finally arrived. So you're Lengko's twin? What's your name? Lengki? Lekong? - Vinsen, sir. - Oh. So anyway, about Lengko... You know, I really did try my best to save him, but Topan... Ahh. Because we got caught in the traffic jam, we've arrived too late. Fuck! Topan! Topan. Mark my words. I will skin his crotch. What I'm gonna do, I'll pull his pants down, then tie him from behind... - Is he for real? - I'm going to rip his underwear off. Very slowly... And then, I'll take out the razor. I will cut his balls off. And then, I'll swallow them both. Hey! Don't you dare touch Topan. Because he is all mine. Do you understand? Antonio! We'll head to the woman's location. ♪ Saying "what the fuck?" This is how we do it ♪ So now you know. Now you understand why Topan can't answer your question. So typical of men. Stupid, ugly dumbass! Sorry. Stop acting so depressed! And why shouldn't I? Hmm? Because it's too damn late. It's been three years already! I searched for three years. But what do I get since I came here? I almost died from frog poisoning, you know. Then I was chased and hunted. Now I learn my father's a killer. You know how that feels? How dare you call him a killer! Shut up! - What else am I gonna call him? - Your father's not a killer! - What did you say? - Bitch! Sis! Topan and Jenggo might be looking for us. Let's go. Get out of my face! Listen. When I was little, my parents died from a church bombing. Would you like to know who saved me from the rubble, beneath the dead bodies? Go ahead. You can call us whatever you want. Killers, criminals, or villains... But to call your father a murderer? So what, does that justify what you've been doing? You're dead. You're dead. Criminal. Look at you, all high and mighty. Daddy issues. Wicked witch. Idiot kid. - What did you say? - Idiot kid! You're a dangdut bitch! Low ranker! Old man's mistress! Hah! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Flat-chested cop! Flatty flat flat. Slutty mermaid bitch! Fuck you! Bitch! Sis! - Did you hear that? - What do you want? Watch out! The table! If I say run, you run, okay? Run! Run! Get them out first, and we'll meet on the boat, okay? Be careful. - Stay behind me. - Okay. I need a gun. Take his. Back me up! - I'll take the other side. - Be careful. Okay. Fuck you, bastard! Fuck! You fucker! Report. We found them. The target is... Bitch! - Let go, bitch! - You let go, you rat-faced bastard! I'm not rat-faced! [grenade exploding} So clingy. Over here. Hide here until the coast is clear, okay? Hmm? I'm not scared of you. You're so dead. One-eyed cockatoo! You bitch! You punk ass! Hey! Stop pretending, asshole! Who the hell sent you? Answer me, asshole! - Alpha. - What? He's already dead. It's dangerous here. Let's go. Dina! Dina! Shit! Shit! Dina! Dina! Jenggo! Alpha! Come on, retreat! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Calm down. It's me. You're safe. It's me. Okay? Calm down. Are you okay? Are you hurt? Are you... Don't do that around me! - Hey, Dina, are you okay? - Pelor! Fuck! Let him go, fuckers! - Fuck you! I'll kill all of you! - Hey. - Topan, they got Pelor! - I know. I know. Calm down. Calm down, okay? Are you serious? - Alpha, no. - Why? Why? - Please. Let me answer it. - Hey, pick up! Topan, where are you going, huh? If you keep going, I swear I'm going to break every single bone in his body, starting with his fingers. Vinsen. Where? Where all of this started. Fuck you, you bastards! BIRTH CERTIFICATE SURANTO BIRTH CERTIFICATE TOPAN GEMURUH Topan, we've gone far enough. Where do we stop? I'll find a mooring then. Alpha. Alpha. - Alpha! Hey! - What? Pelor was your responsibility. You're the best of us. - You should've watched him! - My responsibility? What's yours? Why mine? I have my own life! You should be responsible! You put us in danger! Just like father. Putting everyone's burden on me. What the fuck are you saying? You're our big brother! Fuck! Shit! Bitch! Control it. Control it. Calm down. Control yourself. Calm down. Fuck! Bitch! Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! Stop! Dina's here. I'll take the blame. Regardless of the mess that I've caused, should you guys be fighting amongst you? Blaming each other like this. Have you forgotten that you're siblings? A family? You have each other. Instead of fighting, could we just focus on rescuing Pelor? Oh yeah? What's in it for you anyway? You're a cop, and we're criminals, right? Yet we have the same enemy. And we all want to rescue the same person. The five of us... we all love the same father. Get away from me. - All right. Let's find a dock. - Enough of this. Come on. Wake up, kiddo. Or should I wake you with a knife to the kneecap? Hey. Hey. Oh, spare me, sir. - I don't even know you. Please. - So let's get to know each other. - Easy. Easy. - Hmm? Let me start first. - Easy, easy, easy! - Easy my ass. A long time before The Big 4, I was the first son. But why did Petrus cast me away? See that? That's why. He told me I was too ambitious. Unpredictable. I was dumped on the street like an unwanted puppy. But the one who killed him that day is a scorpion. So it was all for revenge? A person's life or death is ultimately determined by those who have power! And I, Antonio Sandoval, Prince of 1001 Knives, is more powerful than The Big 4. - The Scorpion of Southeast... - Scorpion? Topan can easily stomp a scorpion. He'll beat you for sure. Yeah? On what ground, huh? Huh? I can see it clearly in your eyes. I see the fear. Because eyes never lie, Mister. Okay, I just wanna make my point clear. This place will be your grave, asshole! Whoa! Amazing merch, Alpha! So, being a slutty mermaid paid off after all. - No. No. This is illegal. - Mouthy bitch! This is in clear violation of article two of the Emergency Law No. 12. - Whoever owns, keeps, distributes... - ...distributes or uses it to rescue Pelor... Take your pick. So that's Dina's type. Something big, and long, and black. Looks like we're a match. Oh! Topan! Alpha. Topan. One's big, the other's tiny. Just like your balls. Jenggo. Your mind is always in the gutter. Balls! Watch your mouth, sis. Control yourself. Topan. Topan. Oh, me and Dina? - I mean father's cap! - Oh. - He's still crushing on her? - You know. The usual midlife crisis. Hey. I heard that. - What's this? - Bitch, you wanna blow us all up? Blow us up? Any idea how much ammonium nitrate is in here? A high-pressure gas cylinder? Filled with potent explosives? - Cool! - This is my latest creation. Lucifer's Fart 3000! - Fart? - Fart. - Lucifer? - Lucifer. No, thanks. - Why, what's wrong? It's a fearsome name. - What's fearsome about fart? What is it now? I'm not sure. I feel like nothing here calls to me, you know? You miss your girlfriend? - Siska? - Mm-hmm. - Jenggo. - Yeah? - Siska? - Mm-hmm. This just shows how much I love you. I'm giving Siska back to you. You bought it back from Bunglon? I borrowed it. Behind his back. Smooth! What is it now? It's been too long, you see? Truth is, many people had their hands on Siska. Hey! Watch your mouth! But still, she only longs for you. And only your finger... Where's your finger? Show me your finger. Your finger alone fits her hole. So it's okay. Put it in slowly, okay? Hmm? - Hey, don't look at her. - Okay. - She'll be embarrassed. - Mm-hmm. I imagined that she missed you so bad. Bunglon locked her up for three years. So it's okay. Put it in. Gently, slowly. Don't hesitate. Put it in. Put it in. Put it in! Siska! I miss you! You freak! Siska... Siska! That's my blood. The night dad died, the man next to him, was it you? Yeah. And I shot you? The pain I felt from that is nothing compared to my failure to save him. Forgive me. You know, you were everything to him, Dina. I'm certain that if he didn't die that night, he would've quit this line of work. What were his last words? To take care of you, whether near or far. But, you know what I've been thinking? Once all of this is over, as soon as we've rescued Pelor... - What should I do next? - You'll turn this case over to the police. Everyone will know you're the daughter of Petrus the killer. No. You're wrong. I am Dina. Petrus' daughter, a man who loved his children with all of his heart. It suits you. Cheers. Alpha, you should be more like Dina. Girlfriend material. Instead of being all weird and messing around with Lucifer's fart. Huh? Ass wart, look at you and your Siska. What a freak. Woman, what the hell do you know about love, huh? Hey! This will be dangerous. Antonio is a tough one. Hmm. It's been a while since we did anything like this. But I have no doubt that Petrus prepared us for a day like this and turned us into a family. Peler, do you still think your brother is going to save you? Yes, hello? Tell me. Why is it spiraling out of control? You know what's the cost of you being compromised? Hey, listen to me. If you desperately want to kill The Big 4, why don't you come here and do it yourself? Watch your mouth, boy. Remember who you work for. What's that? What'd you say? Come on, then! Wanna start shit with me? I will destroy you just like I did with Petrus! Think I'm scared of you? Fucking asshole! I'll fucking rip you apart. ALPHA Topan. How are you doing, man? I just wanna ask one thing. Oh yeah? Ask away. Why do you call yourself Antonio if Petrus was your foster father? Say that again? - Your name, bro. It doesn't make sense. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Uh. Let's talk about this in private. Let's meet. I'll be waiting. Hah! I'm already here. You, you, you, get down there, now. Yes sir! Alo. Stay with me. Don't just stand there! Shoot them! Quick! Check the inside! LUCIFER'S FART Jenggo will cover you. Go forward. Jenggo, we're going in. You cover on the outside. Ready. We'll stand by here. All good. Right, Siska? On my count! Kill them all! What the... - Please, bro! - Just die, bastard. See that, Jenggo? Pretty cool? Sure. But don't let it get to your head. Just go in already. - Ready? Right side. - Okay. - Second floor. - Got it. One, two, three... Wait! - You were right. - Right about what? I abandoned you guys. I'm truly sorry about that. - We forgive you. Let's go. - Okay. - Yeah. - Get ready. One, two, three... Hey! Once we go in, father's dream will be absolutely destroyed. Yes, but we're doing it to save Pelor! Let's go! Hey, Pops. I'm really sorry, Pops. We need to save Pelor. Ready? For real now. - Yeah. - Let's go. One, two, three... - Hey! Wait! - What the fuck? - When I was little... - Fuck, get out of the way! Don't let your guard down! Upstairs! Get that guy! Fire! Clear? - Clear. - Clear. - Alpha, go and cover the door. - Copy. - Dina. Second floor. Move it. - Moving. Come on, move, move, move, move! Cover. Trust me! Move. Move! Stop, hold! Hold. Move. - Move, move. Get going! - Move. Check the rooms. Find Pelor. On my way. Din, are you okay? I'm okay. Die, you pig! Focus. Find Pelor. Lead. Right on. - I'm sorry. - Shh. I said I'm sorry. Hey! Dina. Dina! Dina! Dina! - Hey! - Huh? Easy now. Just let her be, man. She should be able to handle him. After all, she's Petrus' daughter. Now, you. Are you ready to die? Topan! Come on, I see you. - Don't kill me, boss! - Get up! Hey! That hurts. This monkey is pretty fast. Skinny bitch! Let's go hand to hand if you dare! Missed me! Now you know why they call me The Scorpion of Southeast Asia. My zodiac sign's a dog, dickhead. Alpha, secret vicious kick formation! Crafty bitch! Siska... Hey, bro. Jenggo, wake up. Wake up, Jenggo. - Stay strong, bro! Wake up. Wake up! - What? Wake up. Wake up. Come on, stay with me, bro! Stay with me. Come on. You gotta wake up. Alpha! Siska! You fuckers! Siska... Alpha, Siska is gone... Just find a real hole. Scorpion, my ass! This is Bersi! Welcome to the villa called Paranais, where everything is nice. Kill me, and you'll never find out who's behind our father's death. It's you, asshole. Topan... Our world is not that straightforward. Do you honestly think I acted of my own accord? Who's behind his murder? - Tell me! - Keep guessing! Hey! Dina? Don't you wanna know who killed your father? Fuck this. Pelor! Save Pelor! Hurry after him! - You're right. - Save Pelor! Yeah, yeah. Pelor. Hey, Asian Scorpion. Are you ready to die? Hey, Asian Scorpion. Big bro! What do you want? I'll kill this kid, just like I killed your beloved Petrus! And I'll be carrying my employer's name to the grave! - Shh. - I am the winner. I am the winner. - I am the winner! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Wanna kill me? - Of course. - Kill me then. Talk to me. - Talk to you? - Listen to me. - What is it? - You win. - Okay. Suranto. - Suranto? - What the fuck did you call me just now? Suranto who likes to poke. Come here. Come here. My name is Antonio Sandoval. - Suranto. - But I just told you, Antonio Sandoval! - Come on, man. - Prince of 1001 Knives. The Scorpion of Southeast Asia. Suranto. Play with his lil' knives. - Suranto. - Hey, don't laugh. - Suranto doesn't have any friends. - I have so many friends! - Oh, Suranto wants to join The Big 4. - I'll kill him. Please, spare me. - I'll kill him. - Suranto - Suranto. - Asshole. Antonio Sandoval! Fuck you! Who said I was lonely? I'm a ladies' man, ask anyone. I'm good at salsa. What's that? What are you doing? Fuck you! I'll fuck your little brother! I'll fuck him! Wow! El scorpio! Is it good? Feels good, right? You like that? Fuck me! Fuck you! Fuck you! Pelor, get up! Fuck this. Suranto! Topan. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. I'm also okay, bro. Thanks for asking. Where's Antonio? - Pelor, check on the others. Be careful. - Yeah. - Hey, careful. - I'm okay. I'm okay, thank you. - Uh, Pelor. - Yeah? Can you close the door? What is it? Oh. - Hey... - Pelor... - Oh. Yeah. - What are you... Pelor, please. I just wanted to say that I'm keeping my promise to you, Topan. What promise? I've called headquarters. And as part of my duties, I asked them to take care of everything. Listen. You don't have to worry. I promise that you, Pelor, Jenggo, Alpha, everyone will be treated fairly... - Topan? - Take care of Pops' cap. Topan! Topan! - One day I'll explain everything. - Explain it to me right this minute! Don't leave me here like this! Topan! Madam police. - Adios. - Huh? Bye, Dina. So sorry. See you later, sis. - Pelor, help me take this off, please. - Check the cap. I said, check the cap.
