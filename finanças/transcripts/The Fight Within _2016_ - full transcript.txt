[DISTORTED THUMPING] MAN: Come on, Logan, that was sloppy! Come on, Logan, use that left arm. Power hand! Drive with those legs, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive! Give me one. One. One, two. One, two. Come on, Logan. Get your hands up. Come on, Logan, finish this. Put him away. One, two. One, two. Come on, give me a little bit more tension. One, two. One, two. One, two. Come on, that's it. Get a little bit more movement here. Move around here right now. Let's go. One, two. One, two. You're still dropping that right, here. Let's go, get focused here. Go, one, two. One, two. - [THUMPING] - One. One. One, two. One, two. Come on, Logan, get focused. This is the most important fight of your career. You win this match, you get to turn pro. This is the most important fight for you. For me or for you? What did you say? What'd you say? LOGAN: I said is this really about me, or is it about you and your past glory? What are you talking about, me and past glory? Dropping your right again. Face me. Jab cross, move to your right. That's why you keep your right hand up. Do it on the bag. Come on. Good. Keep that right hand high when you move to the right. That's it. Time. Look, uh, I know tuition for this semester's past due. I got to have a few more days. Is everything okay? Yeah, we're just short on cash. Well, you got a class in 30 minutes. Hit the shower. Don't be late. [♪♪♪] All of this... always pushing me to be a champ, always forcing me to win... this is just some twisted hunt because you're too old to fight. Is that what you think this is all about? You think I do this all for me? Well, I'll show you what this old man can do. Come on. Show me what you got, come on. [GRUNTS] Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Hey. Dad. Mason! Hey. Dad! Mason! [♪♪♪] What can I do for you? Hey, can I speak to the owner, manager, please? You're looking at both. Great. I'm raising funds for an orphanage in Mozambique, and I'm wondering if I can put some posters up. - Sure. - Cool. Um, it's a home for rescued homeless children. The goal of the orphanage is to keep these kids from turning to crime or becoming sold as sex slaves. We really want these kids to know that they're loved and that God is listening and that he's provided them all with a better way of life. It's kind of a choice - that we all have to make, and... - Look, you can put up whatever you like, if you just stop talking. MAN: Why are you even here? You know I'm just training with Logan. Let's see how tough you are. Back off. I'm just trying to get out of here. Take a shot. Andy. It's all right, man. - Go ahead and leave. - [CHUCKLES] You know what, you're real tough here where your brother can protect you. You just always run that mouth, - don't you, Hayden? - [CHUCKLES] I see you brought your boys. Excuse me. HAYDEN: Hey, who do you think you are? Everyone in this place knows you're not a fighter anymore. You're a has-been, just like your old man was. That's enough, Hayden, you need to shut your mouth. Logan. Logan! Take off. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Man, I'm sorry. STUDENT: It's okay. Um, here. - No, really, it's okay. - Don't worry about it, it's cool. - I got another one. - Thanks. Today we are going to discuss the different definitions of ethical behavior... what defines right or wrong. First up is consequentialism, which is the belief that right or wrong is weighed by a punishment that someone may or may not experience for any given action. Now, what might be an example of this? Ms. Davis. Say you murder somebody, then you're going to jail. PROFESSOR: Okay, so, the only reason you don't murder someone is to stay out of jail? - Well, no. - Yeah. Yeah, because there's more to right or wrong than just consequences. Another definition is deontology. Deontology consists of a list of rules that document right and wrong. Now, where do we typically see this derive from? Religion. Yeah. Yeah, like the-the Ten Commandments from the Old Testament. Which brings us to utilitarianism, which defines the right thing as whatever helps the largest number of people. But what might be a potential problem with that? Logan. When you start justifying something's right for some greater good, it's easy to ignore the wrong it could be doing. Like if a person shattered a glass door... it'd be wrong to do it, but you could justify it because you were angry? Okay. I-I think we're straying a little bit from utilitarianism, but, uh, that's interesting. Humans are intelligent beings... brilliant. We can look beyond - a rule or a consequence... - You were there? - PROFESSOR: ...to the effects. - Shh. If a decision benefits a lot of people, it speaks for itself. Businesses most commonly use this type of decision-making process. But the rabbit hole ultimately leads to the issue of moral relativity. Is there a definitive right or wrong in the universe? Hey. So, you really think people are only good when it's convenient? Hey. What are you talking about? What makes good people do bad things? People make bad choices. Okay, so... I chose to talk to you. Would you say that's a good thing or bad thing? It's probably a bad thing. Okay. Hey. Can I try that again? I'm Logan. Would it be a bad thing if I took you to lunch? I'm Emma. - [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] - Hmm. What's good here? I like the grilled chicken plate. It's low fat, - comes with a salad. - WAITRESS: So, your usual? - Yeah. - And for you, miss? Okay. Um, I'm gonna have a cheeseburger, please, with bacon on it and fries. - Okay. - Thanks. All right, so, what's the deal? The deal? The anger, shattering a glass door... what's that about? I don't usually lose it like that. So, it's like a Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde thing? Yeah, exactly. You're a fighter, that's what you do? I don't get it. Well, the gym's not like what you saw the other day. Really? What is it like? Well, some people come to learn to protect themselves, they want to feel safe. Others enjoy the challenge. Just... they push themselves to these limits. What made you start fighting? My dad was a fighter. He's a champ. It's all I ever remember him doing. So, I guess I was born into it. Does he still fight? He died a couple of years ago. Oh. He gave the gym to me and my brother Mason. What about your mom? She left when I was young. Logan, I'm... sorry. It's just me and my brother now. He's all I got. I'm sorry. I know I'm... I'm unloading a lot. No, it's okay. We all have our history. What about you? Maybe we can talk more about it next time. Next time? LOGAN: Good morning. Did you decide to get up? I'd sleep all day too if I didn't have a job. Ow. Guess what. I talked to a girl. I don't know. Man... something about her. For your sake... [CHUCKLES] ...I hope she likes dogs. Let's go, Andy. Two. Two. Double up. Two. Hey. Hang on a sec. Hey, guys. Andy. Why you let someone who won't fight train you? Hey, don't listen to him. Let's go. Two. Two. Hey, good job today, man. See you guys. All right, this time, when you cut the angle, go deep, hit the thing. All right, throw the hook one time. Not bad. Keep your balance next time. Do it to me. Good. All right. Man, I got come stuff to go do. Three rounds of technical sparring with these guys. A new opponent every minute. Keep it light. - I'll be back in a minute. - Got it. Hey. You know, the Strikehard event's - in a few weeks. - Yeah. You know, I had an interesting visit this morning. - From? - Tom Morris. The fight promoter. Yeah, the fight promoter. What's he want, Hayden as his main event? Yeah, he's willing to let the gym co-promote the event. That means we can share in the ticket sales. If? He wants you to fight Hayden as a pro. Look, Hayden's only loss is to you. He's ready to turn pro, you were ready two years ago. Why not give him a chance to avenge the loss? I'm not fighting him. Hear me out, there's more. Promoter's offering $5,000 a show, and 5,000 a win. And nobody makes that kind of money on a pro debut. You'd be crazy to turn it down. I don't care. Look, Logan, we both know that fight would draw a huge crowd. I can get you some local sponsorship money, with that in the purse, man, we could pay your tuition for a year. You know how much pressure that would take off me in the gym? Logan, you're one of the best fighters I've ever seen. I'm not just saying that 'cause you're my brother. You were one fight away from turning pro. Now you're at the gym all the time, training like a mad man, for what? Just to train? You don't care about me, my family, or the gym, do you? You know, I do get it, Logan. Dad's been dead for over two years. Something's got to give, bro. I got to run. Hold down the fort for me. [GRUNTING] Hayden, I'm done! I've had enough! [GROANING] Hayden! Hayden. That's it! He's had enough. Shut your mouth or you're next. [GROANING] Hayden! Hayden. He tapped. I'm sick of you walking around here like you're something special. I'm not going to fight you, Hayden. Then don't move. [GROANS] What do you think you're doing? Ask your brother. He's going to stay out of my business, or he's gonna get hurt. All right, everybody listen up. We train to compete here, not bar fight. If that's what you're looking for, get out now. That goes for you, too. Get in my office, now. He's out of control. Out of control? He's not the one busting glass doors and picking fights with clients, is he? I was literally gone for five minutes. When are you going to start thinking about the gym as a business? Hayden is everything we said this gym wouldn't be. And the worst thing is, you're training him. - A guy like that. - That's enough, Logan. We agreed this place was going to be different. You train him. You give him a pass in whatever he does. We don't need him. You see all these bills? How do you think they get paid? Where do you think that money comes from? Your rent, your power, your tuition. Whether you like him or not, Hayden wins fights. We need a fighter that can help this business, now, it's Hayden. - Mason. - Out. [BUTTONS BEEPING] How you doing, man? Is that it? Uh, I got gas on seven, and let me get two slices of that pizza, please. Thought you might like something to eat. That's mighty Christ-like of you, young man. Thank you. I don't know about that, just... Looked like you could use some help is all. You do, too. Yeah. I guess we all do, huh? You know, sometimes it feels like no matter how hard you try, everything you do is wrong. Oh, you know, most people mess up 'cause they don't know right from wrong. Just do whatever they want, whenever they want. Bad choices making bad things happen. Just running around trying to prove they're somebody. Not even realizing who they really are. Yeah, well, who are they? God's children, of course. We're all God's children. He loves all of us. Yeah, I guess if you say so, mister. Now, just 'cause you don't know you're God's child, don't mean you're not. And if you ain't God's child, who are you? Well? Okay. Let's go over this one more time. So, who has the stronger case here, the corporation or the individual? The corporation. Okay. What's wrong? Look, I can't concentrate on this. All this stuff with Mason and the gym. Well, maybe you should go talk to him. I will. How about now? Get it over with and then maybe you can pass your finals. You gonna meet me later? Yeah. Yeah, do whatever you want. Hello, guys. What's that about? Let's talk in the office. LOGAN: So what's up? Some of the guys don't want to train with you anymore. Why? Hayden. He found out about the fight and the prize money. He knows you turned it down. He's going around here telling everybody you're scared to fight. And it's not good. Not for you, not for me. Definitely not for this gym. You mean, I'm not good for the gym, right, Mason? That's not what I said. You know Hayden's good at pushing people's buttons. He's got everybody here believing you are scared to fight. It's just a bad situation. It's 'cause he keeps running that mouth. And the worst part is, you're in his corner. You know, everything was fine until Hayden - started training here. - No, it wasn't. You know why? Of course not. You see, since Dad died, I'm the one that has to worry about how the bills get paid. I'm the one that runs the business. The responsibility falls on me, not you. So you pick a guy like Hayden over your own brother. - Pass it off on the bills. - I'm not picking him over you. I just can't have you in here with so much going on. What are you going to do, Mason? You gonna kick me out? No, it's not like that, man. I just need everything to calm down. If you stay, he leaves. I can't help it if you're scared to fight. What did you say? I said everybody here thinks you're scared to fight. Man, can't you see that's a problem? I'm scared to fight? We'll see. Off the mats! Now! Mason! Mason! Logan. Get off the mats and go home. Come on. Let's show everybody how scared I am. You're making a scene. Get off the mats and go home. What's wrong, Mason? Is this bad for business? Well, you ain't making things any better. It's the last time I'm gonna tell you. Go home. Make me. Fine. [GRUNTING] [THUD] [GRUNTS] [FIGHTER LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER FROM FIGHTERS] [GROANING] FIGHTER: Come on, Mason, let's go. [FIGHTER WHOOPING] [SPECTATORS WHOOPING] Who's scared now, Mason? EMMA: Logan! Logan! Logan! What was that? [PANTING] Brotherly love. Logan. Here. What happened? Everyone thinks I'm scared to fight. But hearing that from my own brother... ...I can't take it. It's okay. He's the one person who should understand. Understand what? Why I don't fight. What does he do? He kicks me out. Mason's all I got. I'm here. Congrats on the comeback fight. Looks like I might have to join the family before you give me a shot, huh? I do like your choice in women, though. Want to take a ride with a real man? You want to get your face slapped by a real woman? HAYDEN: She's kind of feisty. I like that. Maybe I should fight her instead of you. I could definitely show her some moves. If you touch her, I swear to God, I'll kill you. You'll get a chance. You're worth ten grand to me. Keep telling yourself that. It's gonna happen, and it will be beautiful. What did he mean you're worth $10,000 to him? Let's go. You know, this is a pretty nice car for someone without a job. You have no idea how many hours I've put in at the gym to get this thing. Hey, come inside. I think I know how to make you feel better. Okay, sit down. So... what are you doing in there that's gonna make me feel better? You'll just have to wait and see. Mm-hmm. Here. So, these are supposed to make me feel better? They do for me. Mmm. Pretty good. They're okay. [EMMA CHUCKLES] So, what's in there? Um... I'll show you. What is all this stuff? This is my mission room. It's where I remind myself about God's plan for my life, which is right here. God's plan? God has a plan for everyone. If you say so. What? You don't believe me? It's not that. I just don't know if I believe in God. Africa. Why Africa? There's so many things you could do here. I just know God wants me to help there. How? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [BIRDS CHIRPING] - [CHILDREN SHOUTING] You really think God loves everyone? I know He does. Look, I believe that once you understand God's love, you want to love others the same way. I just... What? Nothing. Hmm. You're sweet, Logan. You act so tough, but you're sweet. You think I only act tough? [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INSECTS TRILLING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [GRUNTS] That's my boy! - Way to go, son! Yeah! - [HEART BEATING RAPIDLY] - Yeah! He's the man! - [MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY] - [FLATLINING] - Dad, no, you can't leave me. Dad, wake up! Dad! [GASPS] You okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. It's okay. Mmm. It's getting late. - I should go. - Okay. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Hey, my friends are in town from Mozambique, and they want to go to the lake tomorrow. You want to come? More God people? They won't scare you. I might scare them. [CHUCKLES] I don't think so. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I'll see you later. Okay. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] LOGAN: So, they work with orphans in Africa and then come back for lake days? Yeah, every once in a while, they come back and see their families. This is their friends' place. I could visit Africa. But leave everybody and everything? I don't get it. Well, sometimes life is not just about ourselves. You got to make sacrifices for other people, even if it's just a bottle of water when you kick a drink over. So, you've been stalking me this whole time? [GIGGLES] Yeah, right. So, what, does... that make me a mission project for you? If you're asking if I think you need help, then my answer is yes. EMMA: Hey, that's them. Hey! - [CHUCKLES] - Hey, Emma! This is gonna be fun. [BIRD CAWING] [CHUCKLES] So, what's it like to live in Africa? Oh, you know, bird-sized mosquitoes, - diseases, no air conditioning, - [CHUCKLING] lions, hyenas, big snakes, monkeys... just your everyday stuff. It's not that bad. I mean, don't get me wrong, it can be rough at times, because, let's face it, you don't have all the things you have here. But you learn to live on less, and... you learn to trust what God provides. I don't get it. Why give up all this? When I was in the orphanages with the kids, I felt joy, I felt peace. I can really only explain it like this: I knew it was God. For the first time, I felt loved, I felt whole, I felt complete. And for me, I felt called to missions. So, one day, I went into a local village to get some supplies, and while I was there, I heard some yelling. I turned to look and see what all the commotion was about, and, through the crowd, I saw some men beating two young boys. And so I just stepped up in front of 'em. It still amazes me how God protected us. And I knew that day the calling was real. You know, leaving has never been an option for the two of us. MAN: But you're right about one thing: there's still a lot of work that needs to be done here. But most people are too worried about themselves to allow God to work through them.

I just don't like thinking about you leaving. Think I do? Hey, you know the mission stuff that I do? Would you come do some of it with me? I had a great time today, Emma. Your friends were great.

Figured out who you are yet? I'm working on it, old man. Can I get you something to eat? Well, if you're getting something for yourself, I like those little gummy bears, the mixed kind. Gummy bears? Really? Okay. I like these little green ones. So, tell me this, how can God love someone like me? That's 'cause you're His creation, His child. He loves you like a newborn babe. But you have no idea all the bad things I've done, the pain I've caused. That's right, I don't. But I do know what God has done for you, what He wants for you. What can I do for God? It's not about what you can or can't do for His love. It's about your faith in Him, who He is in your life. How does faith change anything? With faith, you'll seek, and you'll find God. Once you find God, everything changes, not because it has to, but because you want it to. You want to do things His way. Sounds like I have a lot of work to do. You know, all of these are really just the same.

It's too far. Get in the car. Where are we going? Logan, where are we going? What's happening? It's Hayden, Emma! If he wants it this bad, he's got it. Well, then he's won and you've lost. What are you talking about? He wants a reaction like this. This is exactly what he wants. That's easy for you to say when it's not your car. Okay. You're right. Look, we grew up in two totally different worlds. I didn't have your perfect family, your perfect childhood. I can't let this go. I'm not asking you to let it go. I'm saying look at how you're handling it. You're right. We didn't grow up the same way, but I'm here, aren't I? I'm trying to understand. - What would you have me do? - It doesn't matter. Just go find Hayden. Go fight. Look who it is. What's up, buddy? You look upset. You ready to take on that fight? It's not gonna happen, Hayden. I'm not about this anymore. I don't care about you, your girlfriend, or your dead dad. I don't even care if God Almighty Himself told you not to fight. Keep getting worse until you get in that cage with me. Are we about to have another problem? We're done here. You know, your boy spray-painted my Jeep. [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] [EMMA CHUCKLES] What? What is it? [CHUCKLING] [CHUCKLES] I'm just really happy and proud. About what? About you being a bigger person than Hayden and making a better choice. And... about you and me. [CHUCKLES] I'm happy, too. Hey. You did the right thing. Yeah, but what about all the bad things I've done? We've all done bad things. I'm pretty sure you've never done anything bad. I never said that. Okay, what is it? I... I've made my share of mistakes. I... ...drank. A lot. And... partied. So, let me get this straight. My sweet little churchgoing, African missionary, queen of the tubes was once a bad girl? In another life. And what business is it of yours anyway? Who says I'm yours? So when are you gonna ask me? Ask what? Well, tomorrow's Sunday. Yup. And I know where you go every Sunday. Are you asking to come to church with me? No. I'm waiting for you to ask me to go to church with you. All right. Sure. Logan Chandler, will you come to church with me? Yes. Okay.

I'll let you know when it's about to happen. Make sure you're paying attention. Wait, what? I'm just kidding. Relax. You don't have to do anything. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for being with us this morning. Uh, would you please join me in prayer as we begin the service. Father, we thank You for the wonderful opportunity that You've given to us today to be assembled in Your name. We endeavor, Lord, to bring honor and glory to You through our prayer, our praises and our preaching, that You might be glorified and that, Father, through Christ, our soul might be satisfied. We pray and ask these things in the name of Jesus. Amen. I want to ask you a question this morning: who are you? And by that, I mean what defines you? I didn't ask you what you do for a living, I didn't ask you what your name is, but who are you? That's an important question because psychology tells us today that we are the sum total of all of our decisions. Our personality... who we are... is defined by our past, so I am a product of my past. And because the past can't be changed, then who I am cannot be changed. I'm in an inescapable dilemma. This leads us to the cultural experience that we have today where people are excusing themselves and their behavior and explaining away who they are by simply relying on the adage that it's the way I was raised, it's what I've known, it's what I've been exposed to. But that is not what the scripture tells us. That is not what Jesus came to do. The Bible states plainly that it was for freedom, that Jesus came to set us free. And through His sacrifice we can have a new life. We can have freedom in Christ if we turn to Him. Just like Saul when he encountered Christ on the road to Damascus. He was so radically changed, so forever and eternally changed, that he later wrote in his epistle to the Philippians that the things that he thought that once defined him were now considered rubbish, and the things that he thought inspired him was now meaningless compared to his new relationship with Christ. Saul had become a new man with a new identity and everything about him was radically and eternally changed. ♪ Who's the one ♪ [♪♪♪] ♪ That hears my voice ♪ ♪ And I don't even have to speak ♪ ♪ And who's the one ♪ ♪ That lifts me up ♪ ♪ And sets me on my feet ♪ ♪ When I'm troubled ♪ ♪ And confused ♪ ♪ Who's the one ♪ ♪ That I run to ♪ ♪ The one who spoke the universe ♪ ♪ Into the void of the night... ♪ So we close this service with this invitation, asking the same question as we asked in the beginning: who are you? Because of what Christ has done today, because you understand what He's done in bearing our sin, punishment on the cross, because of his resurrection and his offer of forgiveness, you can have a new beginning. You can have a new identity. You can be a new creation. Christ will give to you what He gave to Paul: a new start, a new purpose, a new life. But you have to be willing to turn from your old identity and your old way of life and turn to Christ in faith. And He can do that for you today. The question is will you turn?

You don't think the world stops when people fall in love? [SOFT CHUCKLE] My world kind of changed when I met you. No, it didn't. Oh, yes, it did, Logan. When everything stopped, my... I forgot my family and my dreams. I-I almost forgot my name. I can't go on without you. Okay. You got me. What about the fight scenes in that movie? Okay, the guy gets hit, like, a hundred times, and then he gets up and beats up another ten guys? - Yeah. That's supposed - to be believable? I don't know. It's fun to watch. But it's nothing like the real thing. I guess... I don't understand why someone would get into a cage and fight. It's not about getting in the cage to fight. We all fight. Everyone. We all fight the same thing. It's that thing that's inside of you. It just follows you, all the time. You can't explain it. It tells you can't do this. It tells you you're not strong enough to do this, you won't make it. Sometimes it hits you so hard... that you have no idea how you're gonna turn the lights back on. So, then... why did you stop? My dad was the best. You know, that wasn't enough. I had to be the best. He pushed me. The one time I push back... ...he has a heart attack and dies. Logan, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. It's all right. You need to know. You want to come in for a while? I want to. But I should probably go talk to Mason about some of this stuff. Hmm. Want me to walk you in? I'm a big girl, Logan. Bye. [ENGINE STARTS] [GASPS] - [MUFFLED SCREAMING] - Stop. Listen to me. I need you to give your boyfriend a message. Tell him to fight. Tell him, or I will come back here, and I will finish this. It can get a whole lot worse. [CRYING AND GASPING] [CRYING] [INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSIONS] Okay, Ms. Johnson. We're about finished here tonight. We've done all we can do. I've had officers checking the neighborhood. They didn't come up with anything. This report's going to be forwarded to our Criminal Investigations Division. They'll be getting out with you within a few days. What about Hayden? She said she knew it was him. He's been at the gym all night. He's got an alibi. Ms. Johnson, we'll go ahead and place an extra patrol on your residence. I'll have an officer swing by every few hours, make sure everything's okay. Somebody will be in touch. I'm sorry. It's okay. Stay here. Where are you going to go? I'll be back in a bit. Stay here. Where are you going? Logan! Move your head. Keep your chin down. Good. Run the double. Run the double. Good. Pressure. Hayden! I told you I'd kill you if you ever touched her. - Stop, Logan. That's enough. - Get off me. Get off me. - That's enough. - Get off. - Why won't you fight? - I'll fight. It's not gonna happen here, though. I want that money, baby. That's what it's going to take? Okay. Ask him how he got me to fight. Ask him about Emma. You been lying to me this whole time? I do what you couldn't do. I got your brother to fight. Oh, and one more thing. I don't need you anymore, either. I'm out. You just going to walk? You little punk. I'm the one that made you a fighter. All right, God. Show me something. "Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, "because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome." New man, new name. It's funny. MASON: You come to tell me you were right about Hayden? You want to rub it in my face a little? That's not why I'm here. So what do you think? About what? Me fighting Hayden. On paper, there's no way you can win. Since he lost to you two years ago, he's on a ten-fight win streak. Not one of his has been to a decision. They're all finished by knockout or TKO. I don't even think anybody's been to the third round. He's a good striker. Good wrestler, good jiu-jitsu. On top of that, he's a psycho, and he wants to hurt you. I think you're going to get killed. Yeah, you're probably right. That's why I need your help. You trained him. You know him. You can get me ready for this fight. So no more of this, "I'm not fighting." I'll help you. I'm not going to lie, I've always wanted to see you kill this guy. It's not about killing him. It's about stopping him. What he does to people. Can you help me do that? I can. But we've only got two weeks, and he is coming to hurt you. We got to end it. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Two. Good. One more. Come on, man. You got a fight coming up, you got no focus. Where's your head? Do you think I killed Dad? Of course not. [SIGHS] Logan, you can't blame that on yourself. All this time... I was mad. Mad at myself. Mad at Dad. Mad at God. I took it out on you. Logan, you're my brother. I love you. Nothing's gonna change that. Come on. Let's get you ready to smoke this clown. - Let me see it. - No. Stop being a baby. - You've seen it. - Okay. I don't understand why your brother - has to hit you like this. - It's part of it. - It happens. - How? He hates me. He's abusive, and he hits me all the time. That's not funny, Logan. What if it's worse next time? I guess we'll need more ice. [♪♪♪] Well, young man. You're up nice and early. It's a long way from the gas station, old man. How you been? Blessed. How are you? Let's see. I'm dating a beautiful girl. I have peace with my brother. And I'm seeking God. You tell me. I think God wants the very best for you. How do I know what God wants me to do with my life? Well, look around. What's happening around? Talk to Him. Study His Word. It's a lot easier than you think. You'll know. What does God say about fighting? Young man, God has always had fighters. Warriors. Men like Joshua and David. Men who fought for God, for His people. Men who God fought through. So God's okay with me fighting? No, God don't care if you fight. God don't care if a man's black or white, rich or poor. What God cares about... is in a man's heart. And that fight, young man, the fight that's in all men, it's their fight with God. Is He real? Does He love me? Why do I need Him? All those type of questions. Questions they use to try and reject him. That fight, young man, only ends when a man surrenders to Him. Who are you? [LAUGHS] I'm just an old man. [♪♪♪] To fight here is to... [CHEERING] [CHEERING, WHISTLING] Raise your hands for the 170-pound division. Go, Richter! - [SCREAMING] - Go! [LOUD CHEERING AND WHOOPING] [CHEERING AND SHOUTING] Oh! Yeah! About ready? - You good? - Yeah. How you feeling? Oh, well, you know the plan, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh. All right, keep your fingers open. Why do you think we fight? What do you mean? Everything we could have done. We ended up being fighters. Why? Well, I think it's in our blood. Dad was a fighter, I'm a fighter. You're a fighter, too. So you think people are responsible for their choices they make? Seriously? Look, I know it wasn't an easy decision to take this fight, but you're doing the right thing. I know you've faced a lot of tough choices lately, and I want you to know something. I'm proud of you. Dad was here, he would be, too. All right, remember, first round, establish your jab, make him come after you. He'll overcommit and make mistakes. You'll be open to counter, okay? Don't go crazy in the first. [KNOCKING] I'll give you a few minutes. When I get back, no more distractions, all right? Mason said he'd go to church with us if I survive tonight. It's not funny, Logan. What do you think? Well, I'm trying not to. It's gonna be okay. You keep saying that. What's the verse? If God's for us, who can be against us?

[SHOUTING] Hey, look at me. - Can you see okay? - COACH: You really want to hurt him, we need to be sticking to the game plan. Bury him. Well, started off good, then you got hemmed up on the fence. He's gonna keep doing that. You've got to move, you've got to counter him. Do you understand? You have to move, you have to counter. Stick to what we planned. Get up. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] Fight! [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] Get off the fence. Logan, get off the fence!

[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] MASON: He's hurt! He's hurt! Stay with him! [WHOOPING] [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] MASON: Good. Yeah! Yeah, put him away! My dad might not be in my corner. [SIGHS] But my God is. ANNOUNCER: Clearly a win by TKO victory... Logan Chandler!
