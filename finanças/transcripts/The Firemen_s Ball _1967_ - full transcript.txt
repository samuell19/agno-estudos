ANNU AL FIREMAN'S BALL Man of worth distinction. Let's see! Beautiful, huh? - Wow, that's great. It will make him happy. - Pass it around! It's great! Let's see! Let's see! It will make him happy. Very nice, but we should have presented it last year, on his 85th birthday instead of now. - Maybe. That's true. How could we know last year, that he would get a cancer this year? - That's a fact! Now, it's as if we're rushing to give it before it's too late! And you expect him to be happy... - But we're the only ones who know, that he's got a cancer! - He doesn't know! So he can just be happy, can't he? - How do you know he doesn't know! Did you ask him? - How would you know? Not us. And certainly not the doctors. They have no right to tell. That's the law! You can have a huge cancer and the doctor won't tell you a thing. - You can't trust doctors! - What's the use of telling him? You can be half dead. When it's the end, a man feels it. And they won't tell you! - You were never dying, so be quiet! - Look, let's be logical! If he knows, he knows and if he doesn't know we're not going to tell him. - Listen, you hypochondriac! Don't go asking questions! Where does the cancer hurt! Or anything like that! - Don't worry about me! I won't ask him anything. He's playing jokes again. Vaclav! Stop playing games! This is no time for games! There was a cake here. - What? - Put it back! It's not for me It's for the guests! - So what? - Mr Balcar! Mr Balcar! - Don't bother him now! - Mr Balcar! - What? Don't bother me now! - See, what did I tell you! I stand here. I hold the ladder. I can't see on back of my heat! How am I supposed to know anything? - Whether someone was there when you were gone! See my point! - Well. What do we do? - That's your problem! ' Why my Problem? We're the only two here. - Just the two of us! Well, it wasn't me! - Then, who took it? - Please, search me, gentlemen. - No. Sit down! No one's blaming you. There! Look at that! I saw you! - You saw nothing! - Don't lie to me! - You see too much! - Don't lie to me Vaclav! That leg wasn't there! - Of course it was! - Let's go outside! - It stands up by itself! - It'll fall down. - No. It won't. Look! You're a liar! You could walk away! It stands up without you. - Yeah, yeah! - That's how you got it. I saw! - What are you going to do about it? - I saw!- And what are you going to do about it ...? - Damn it, I saw! - Saw, saw...! - Don't deny it! - The cake was your job, not mine! - Who stole it? - It wasn't me! - But you could have! - I didn't take it! You be careful...! Joseph... - I can't work like this! You could have left. Well I'm not staying here with you. I'm going! - Joseph! What are you doing? Where are going? - Help! Help! Get me down! Get me down!! Get me down! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! I can't hang on! I can't hang on! Do something! Help! Please get me down! I'm falling! - May I, gentlemen? - I'm going to I'm going to let go I'm letting go!

Good evening, I'm the mother. I've come to have a look at you. I wanted to ask you what this is all about - My girl told me something about a contest... But I think - she's only a child.

Don't make him stand up! Sit down, grandpa! - Slowly! Slowly! - Move over, lady! - I'm hiding his house from him. Are you going to let him watch... - Turn him around at least! - Turn around, grandpa! - Sit down grandpa! Sit down! Slowly! - He's still looking. - It's his house that's burning. - Aren't you cold, grandpa? - Put him close to the fire. - Get up, grandpa! Let's go a bit closer. Damn it man it's really hot here! - Sit down then grandpa! You won't be cold here. Don't look! What's the use? - I'm borrowing your table, grandpa. Forget the fire, girls! Work! Put the beer there! Now, the glasses! Give me that brandy here! There's no bottle opener. Bottle opener! Wait your turn, we'll get around to everybody! - Waiter, two beers please! - Join the queue! Join the queue! A drink'll warm you up, grandpa. - Give us this bread, our daily bread. Forgive us our sins. As we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. Give me your helmet! - No, I won't! - Give it to me! Give it to me! - Why are you taking my helmet? - Wear the scarf! It'll be cold in the morning. - I'll look like an old woman! - Well, you're an old man! - Well I am an old man. - What's the difference? - An old man and an old woman, there's a difference isn't there! - Yeah, but you're an old man! - Keep it on! It's freezing! And you're sweating. You'll get sick. You keep it! Button up! - Thank you! Thank you! - Good night. - Make sure they come relieve me in the morning. - Good night. - Good night. - Make sure nothing's stolen. Thank you! Thank you very much! Anyone else? Thank you very much! Thank you, you're so kind! Put something in for the old man! He's lost everything! Thank you. Papa! Papa! Papa, come on! He's not moving damn it! - What's going on? - They're collecting raffle tickets for the old man. He's lost everything. - So what? - We've got to stop them! - Why? - Because all the prizes have been stolen. Come here will you! I can't let him in! My job is to keep out anyone who looks like a bum. I can't let him walk in his underwear! Be reasonable! That's impossible! - But he's in terrible trouble. - I know that! Did I say he wasn't? But, what's the use of my standing here... Well I don't have to be here then! - It's completely pointless! Excuse me! Excuse me! Grandpa, I wish to thank on your behalf all the people gathered here. And you folks, allow me to donate in your name to Mr Havelka, the proceeds of our - Collection. - Yes of course, our collection. What I mean is that the collection itself is the result of our - Goodwill. - Goodwill, of course, but also of our The word's on the tip of my tongue! I can't think... Our - Kindness? - Yes of course, kindness too. - Kindness, charity. That's not exactly it, either! - Our comradely feeling. That's what he means! - That's it - of our SOLID ARITY! Allow me to offer to Mr Havelka this moving taken of our solidarity, of our sympathy with his tragic misfortune. But this isn't money! It's just bits of paper! - Of course. They're raffle tickets. You can win beautiful prizes with them. - I need money. That's no good to me. I need money! - But it's the same thing! - Just a minute, we'll do the necessary. - Quiet, please! - Your attention, please! I must report an unfortunate incident. I don't want to dwell on this and I don't want to turn this into an affair! Several of the raffle prizes have disappeared. And we can't draw lots. So we'll put the lights out and in the darkness those who tool the prizes will put them back. No, no - not yet! I'm still talking. Lights, please! Not yet! Turn the lights back on! There seems to be some misunderstanding! There seem to be some jokers here! I distinctly said that those who took, should put back not the other way round! Now, let's try it again! Lights out! Hey! Put something under his head! - Careful, careful boys! Be careful! A bit more! A bit more! - Wait! Lift him! Lift him! There now! Calm down. - Good, well done boys! - You old goat, you idiot! - Leave it alone! - Why did you have to put it back? Why did that idiot try to put it back?! He shouldn't have put it back! It's going to be such a scandal that he put it back! Now, they'll think we're the ones who stole! - There, there, don't get worked up! Let him rest awhile! - What do you mean rest?! He's an idiot, he shouldn't have put it back! - OK, he shouldn't have put it back, but he put it back. Come on. We'll work it out! Let him rest that's all! - How are we going to work this out? - We'll just have to work it out! But not like this I'm guessing! - You're not going to solve the scandal Josef! - What scandal... - It's a disgrace for the whole brigade! - Don't argue! - It's hopeless! - Stop arguing! I'll tell you something! If you were in his position as an hones man you too would have put it back! - I would never have put it back! You remember that! The prestige of the brigade is more important than my honesty! - Our reputation depends on how we're going to settle this raffle business. - Settle what? It's obvious, isn't it? - To you everything's always obvious! - The prizes were stolen. That much is obvious. - Boys, let's face the facts! Those who stole the prizes don't expect to win them. - Don't talk like that Josef! What about the ticket-holders who didn't steal anything? - That's their problem! They should have stolen too! Whoever didn't steal anything is out of luck! - Wait! Don't joke about this please! This is about something else. How about those who stole without buying any tickets? - They're really crooks! That's not really possible is it? - We can check! - How are you going to find out? - You can't! - Wait, boys! We have to assume that everyone of us has bought a ticket. A crook without a ticket? That's too much! - Well, at least, we know where we stand! - Well then, let's try to get out of this... The people are waiting! What do we tell them? - You want explain everything! What are you going to tell them? Just like Jesus-Christ! - Always explaining something to someone... The raffle prizes were stolen. Everyone was right there. They're all under suspicion. So, they'd better shut up! - The fact is that anyone might have done it! - That's not true. That's not true. - But there's something in that. - He's right. - It's not true! - Now, we've got to go tell them! - Yes, but what? - That they're all suspects! - Boys I don't know - if you think so... I could tell them myself- it's nothing. But I think its pointless. - Well I don't know about pointless. - Look, those who did it know themselves that if the stuff is stolen they can't expect to win. And they also know darn well that they're all suspects. They're not so stupid. - We mustn't underestimate people, gentlemen! - That's right, mustn't underestimate! We've got to trust them! - That's right, mustn't underestimate and have faith in them. - We'd better off with five fires... But no! He had to put the headcheese back... - OK forget about that, forget about that! - Quiet! - Wait a minute! Quiet! Somebody - go see what's happening out there! Beloved President, please excuse this unfortunate delay. You know how it is after a fire... Anyway, now we can be more intimate, more sincere. Isn't that right boys? - Right. - Beloved President, allow me to present you with this modest gift in the name of our brigade. Please accept this gift. - Dear friends and colleagues. My sincerest thanks to the Fireman's brigade of which I am now honorary President. There are no words to express my joy and gratitude for this beautiful present and this tribute in the twilight years my life. Again, I thank you for the rare assistance you often gave me in the performance of my duties and various tasks. You have afforded me a high distinction by presenting me with this valuable gift.
