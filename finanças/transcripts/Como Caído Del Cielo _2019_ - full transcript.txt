NETFLIX PRESENTS Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Shut up! Why are you interrupting me? You scared my audience away. What audience? The one I carry in my heart. You have been singing nonstop since you arrived. I've told you a thousand times, as soon as you give me my ticket to Heaven, I'll stop singing. If it were up to us, we would have dispatched you a long time ago. Well, I'm tired of being stuck in limbo. I wish we could send him to Hell. Hell? No way, gentlemen! That's where we send incorrigible womanizers like you. What about all the joy I brought to my people with my movies and songs? That's why you're here. You did too much good to rot in Hell. But you behaved too badly to be allowed in Heaven. Badly? In your dreams. No woman ever took me seriously because they said I played the field. And I played the field because no woman ever took me seriously. Explain. You see, women were what kept me strong. They were my vitamins. Thanks to them, I was able to sing about love. -God is love, right? -Yes. Then I was like his prophet. Think about all the people who fell in love to my songs. It's not fair that I'm stuck here. Let's give him another chance. That way, it'll be easier to get rid of him. I'm sorry. It was all my fault. Cousin! You're here early. -What's up with you? -You know... Praying for you both. Even though I know your marriage wasn't going that well. Move over. What's wrong, Doctor? Father, what are you doing here? It's been 90 days since he went into a coma. He's not going to wake up. Why should we keep him alive? So this poor and honorable family goes into debt? I'm the only one going into debt, Dad. And if you cared so much about the hospital bills, -you wouldn't have stolen the money... -Stolen? ...my coworkers raised. I invested it at the track. If only your mother could see you... Calm down, Uncle. If we need money to keep Pedro Guadalupe alive, I can chip in. What will you chip in? I already paid for everything. Enough. Father, please get on with your job and give him the holy oils. When the dog dies, so does the rabies. Hold on. I'm his wife. Nothing happens unless I say so. Isn't that right, Doctor? You get the final word, ma'am. Honey, please understand. You can't be tied to this dying womanizer. I want to talk to you, Doctor. Get out of here. Show me some respect. I'm your father! Remember your wedding vows, cousin. "In sickness and in health." -Stay out of it. -In sickness! -Get out of here. -What a temper. Come on. Let's go. Not you, Father. Give it to me straight, Doctor. Do you think my Pedro Guadalupe could wake up someday? If it weren't for these machines... he would die immediately. Are you sure? There's nothing we can do. Go ahead, Father. -Are you ready? -God! Your time has come. Goodness! That's why you wouldn't let me look at you! And they say I'm indecent. Cover your eyes, Sister. I don't want you to die from the shock. -She can't see you. -She didn't recognize me. Or hear you. -Pedro, this is your chance. -Yes. You will borrow a body. A body? Either you prove once and for all that you deserve Heaven, or you'll go straight to... Understood? Not really, but I never back down. As long as I don't go back to limbo, it's all the same to me. Sorry, wrong room. This way. You'll borrow the body of one of your impersonators, who, following in your footsteps, ended up in a coma. He was caught by his lover's husband? Or worse, his wife caught him with a lover? To save yourself, you have to fix in his life what you couldn't fix in yours. You will have to be faithful. And you can't say that you are Pedro Infante. Nor ask about your past. Or there will be consequences. From now on, your name is Pedro Guadalupe Ramos. I'm ready, Doctor. It's now or never. Hold on... -He's blinking! -What? Doctor! You're alive! You're alive! Who are you? What do you mean? She's your lawfully wedded wife. -Really? -Yes. Yes. In that case, come here. I was betting he'd be gone in less than 30 days. Narciso gave him no more than 60, and you, maximum 90 days. So, no one won because he's alive and well. And you kept our money. The resurrected has arrived! -My dear son-in-law. -Dad. Give me that. It's out of tune. It's tuned for his classes at the conservatory, not for playing along with his band. When did he learn to play the violin? The doctor said that since he lost his memory he might act strangely. I need to keep a close watch on him. He looks fine. Maybe being in the hospital did him some good. Maybe you'll make him a hard-working man. That'd be nice. You should have seen the way he kissed me. Great! A fresh start, sis. Maybe you can make him behave. No, I can't stress him out. He needs rest. For now. Now it's your turn. Who's going to help you pay the hospital bills? Quiet. What's for lunch, babe? I mean, my love. I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse. -Can I see that? -Okay. You have one of those too? I'm an Uber driver now. No, you're not a driver. You're a chauffeur. It's an Uber Black. Can I see it? Oh, my God. It's alive. Get it out! Get it out! We have to remind him. There's a reason why he woke up just in time. It's a sign. Don't even think about it. You heard what Raquel said. No stress. He needs to rest. If he's not going to work, then why did he wake up? Am I excited, or does this woman have Marilyn's lips, Jackie's calves, and Elizabeth Taylor's ears? -What did you say? -Nothing. Just thanking Saint Pachomius for waking me up. I made up the couch for you. -Aren't we married? -Yes, but... You've been sleeping on the couch for a while now. Come. You'll remember. Why don't you help me remember? I didn't wake up just to continue being alone. You haven't looked at me like that since we were dating. What a waste. I hope it hasn't been long. Lie down. The doctor said you need to rest. -Put your feet up. -Lie down with me. Come closer, woman. I don't bite. It's okay. I hope this is a new start for us. Did I behave that badly? You always came home late... but you came. Except the last time when they found you beaten in the gutter. How did I get there? Nobody knows. Pedro! Pedro! What are you doing? Hi. It was uneven. That's why it was dripping and making noise. I checked the compressor, but it started making noise again. Well, not anymore. Forget about that. Do you want some breakfast? I took the liberty of making you some breakfast, ma'am. Look at this. But that's too much for me. I made it for you and me. I wasn't going to let you eat breakfast alone, was I? Come on, sit down. No. Let me go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. I won't be long. What's up, Miss Roach? What are you doing here? Isn't my wife perfect? Getting into Heaven will be easier than I thought. What are you doing, Pedro Guadalupe? The doctor ordered you to rest. I'm getting this body in shape so no one steals my wife. -Put that down, please. -Okay. You're the law. Where are you going? It's the first day of the fair and I'm working a double shift. What a beautiful uniform. -Don't you want to stay here with me? -I can't. Rest, okay? It's a miracle that you're alive. You look strong. Yes? This is Andrade. Well... thanks for breakfast. I'll wait for you here. Oh, my God. I wasn't this short, but what a nice head of hair. Times have changed. And so have pants. I'm sorry, honey! If my daughter doesn't go to Disneyland with the other quinceañeras, they'll think we're broke. All because of you, Roberto. But we're throwing her a party. A party no one will come to. You have no idea how high society works. This again? -What's going on? -My dad mixed up the dates. My appointment at the consulate was yesterday. I lost my visa, my trip to Disneyland, and all my friends. We could smuggle her over the border. Back in my day-- My daughter isn't crossing the border like some-- What's wrong? I think I got some earwax buildup over the last 90 days. Damn you. -Where are you going? -I just got an Uber request. -I hope it's as far as Rosarito. -But she has to go to school first. I'm not going anywhere! You'll be in trouble if you fail math, Milagros. I'm going with you. Give me a ride to the café. Let's go. Milagros! Milagros. Leave me alone! My mom's going to kill us. Why me? It was your fault. I should go. If you leave, I'll tell my aunt that I saw you kissing a woman outside the corner store. What woman? My aunt cries a lot. Probably because of her work. Police officers see terrible things. Well, my mom says you cheat all the time. A young girl like you shouldn't be saying things like that, much less saying that you saw me with any girl. -Look, I promise I'll change. -Really? Yes, why do you think I came back from the dead? You better, because my aunt has been very patient with you. Maybe it's because you were her first love. I would have dumped you a long time ago, like I broke it off with Tito because he liked one of Belinda's pictures. Who's Belinda? What's a "like"? Uncle! My first memory of you is when you didn't show up for Christmas dinner. We had a gift exchange and I didn't get my gift. That was the first Christmas you stood us up. They say that's why my aunt doesn't want to get pregnant. Well, this little bunny is fixed. -Really? -Good as new. Darn it! Oh, no. Are they ripped? Look at that. These tight clothes have made men weak. He had nerve, cheating on an armed woman. What an ugly mustache. Now I look more like myself. Good afternoon. Pedro! Pedro, I thought you didn't remember! Remember what? Chema, come get us. Pedro is ready. -Why are you pressuring him, Chava? -Come on. -Tell Chema you want to participate. -What do I have to do? -What you do best. -Chava. Which is? Sing as Pedro Infante. -Hello? -Then I'm going to win. How many people will be there? -All of Tijuana. -Chava? -Let's go. -Let's go. I've been waiting for this moment for so long. So have we. You heard him. The prize is 100,000 pesos! Where are you taking him? My aunt said he can't go out. -She said that? -Yes. Why is this kid telling me what to do? You're coming with us. The lady that bares half her body at sea. BINGO The mermaid! You better behave, my friend, or beware the red fiend. The devil! Look at that green monkey trying to escape. Look, bingo! There's even a Chinese singer. I didn't know I was this famous. -I mean, Pedro Infante. -You're next. Let's welcome Pedro Guadalupe Ramos. It's a shame we can't go on with you. Give it all you've got. It's 100 grand, Pedro. -Sure. -Good luck! You can do it! Thanks, guys. Come on, mariachis! Don't fall behind. Look, your husband can really sing. The doctor said he should rest. Did you bring him here? No, he brought me. End him. They say there's only one wife. A round of applause for our six finalists! And for the celebrities who honor us tonight with their presence at this Pedro Infante impersonator contest. Now we'd like to call to the stage Mexico's sweetheart, Angélica María, who is bringing out the envelope with the results. You're so sweet. Thank you. Good evening. What a joy to see Pedro come back to life on this stage. When I worked with him on Los Gavilanes, I was a little girl. Pedro was a beautiful human being, and so talented. For me Pedro Infante is, and will always be, the best artist I have ever met. Good luck, guys. Thank you. Her eyes are still so expressive. Just like mine. I'd like to call to the stage our queen, Samantha Rueda. She will be awarding the prize for third place... -Why are you clapping? -Okay, enough. ...the remastered discography of Pedro Infante with over 300 songs. Three hundred and forty-four, to be exact. The third place goes to... Richard Zapata from Reynosa. You're next, buddy. Second place will be awarded by our idol's granddaughter, Jenny Infante. Please honor the people of Tijuana with a few words about your grandfather. Good evening. Thank you for having me. Congratulations to all the impersonators. You were great! My grandfather brought a lot of joy to the people of Mexico. And I'm sure he will always be the idol of many men... and women. But... The truth is that... my grandfather didn't treat women very well. Pedrito was a good man, but he was also a womanizer. Well, I guess those were different times. I'm sorry. Let's continue the celebration. And the prize for second place, an amazing karaoke machine, goes to... Pedro Guadalupe Ramos from Tijuana. Andele, andele. Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! And first place goes to... Do Yun Yang, from Seoul, Korea. Angélica María and our mayor, Abstemio Suárez, will be giving him a check for 100,000 pesos. Thieves! Angélica, do something. Jenny! You sang very well. You should have won. You surprised us! What? Miss Tijuana Fair. We should have won first place. It's all politics. I'm sure the mayor made a deal with the Koreans to set up some factories. But you sang very well. We have fans now. You won't need to work anymore. He sang very well. You were incredible. Oh, my God. Look at what I got you, Uncle. So cute. You can have this thing. I don't even know how to use it. -For real, Uncle? -Sure. I've always told my daughter, "Pedro Guadalupe is great." Now we have to sell this thing to recover the 100,000 pesos Mexico's sweetheart stole from us. No way, Dad. He just gave it to her. My heart... Let's go home. It's too crowded here, and you have to rest. -Why are you laughing? -Because I lost. Okay, let's go. Don't mind me. -Come on! -Pedro! Pedro! What are you doing, lovebird? What are you looking at? Get on. Behind you? Like a kid? No way. Move back. -You can't drive a motorcycle. -Says who? Look at him. Alive and kicking. Don't hit anything. -Where's the kickstarter? -There, push the start button. Start. It started beautifully. -Be careful. -Hold on. Hold on to your hubby, honey! -Step on it! -You're not getting out of this one. How people change when they see the Grim Reaper. You know what the mayor said, we can't lose sight of him. There they go. Turning the corner. Which motorcycle is it? Turn here. -They went straight. -Follow him. He drives like he's immortal. Where are we going? Anywhere, as long as it's with you. Come in. You must still be weak, but I really want you right now. A husband should always fulfill his duties. For one night with you, I'd die all over again. Why would you say that? Don't even joke about it. -Did I scare you? -Yes, you scared me. I'm not going to die. -No? -Not yet. -Never. -Don't be scared. Slowly, so your heart doesn't get too stressed. Slowly. It's been a long time since I felt this good. What about me? It's been 60 years. -Are you okay? -Yes. -Pedro, are you okay? -Yes. I might have gotten up too quickly. -Are you sure? -Yes. What do you mean, 60 years? I mean that one month in a coma equals 20 dog years. And... Never mind. It felt like forever, all that time without you. For me, too. While you were in the hospital, when I shaved you, I'd play all your favorite songs to see if that would wake you up. Especially "Amorcito Corazón." You'll wake everyone up. -I don't care. -No. You can sing it to me tonight in my ear. Whatever you say. What are you thinking? Jenny Infante. I knew this couldn't last. Hold on. That's not what I meant. Jenny is just a girl. I just meant that... I didn't like it when she said her grandfather didn't treat women well. What's so shocking about that? Your idol was no Boy Scout. Who knows what he must have done to his family. Poor girl. -Mrs. Raquel Andrade de Ramos? -Are you from the bank? Please sign here. What's this? A petition for divorce. What? For me? Ask your spouse. Bastard! I was such a fool to trust you again. Get out of here! Now! You know I don't remember anything. Let me-- -Excuses. -No. I'll refresh your memory. Please, Raquel. I just came back to life and you want to kill me again! -Get out of here! -Calm down. What's wrong? In this life, there's no clean slate. -Give me that. Stop spying. -But, Mom! Degenerate. Cover yourself. -Poor Raquelita. -Uncle! Let's go home before there's another shoot-out! Uncle, I brought your things. Hey! I'm talking to you! Thanks, kiddo. Don't tell anyone I did that. AWKWARD MOMENT AT IMPERSONATOR CONTEST "GRANDFATHER DIDN'T TREAT WOMEN WELL" Look at this. Nice. Caught with his pants down. No way you're getting out of this one. What's up, gentlemen? I think you're mistaking me for someone else. My wife just kicked me out of the house. That's why we're here, weasel. Come on, walk. Get him! Come on, run! What are you doing? Get him! Lovebird! Get him! Hurry! -Come on, run! -Lovebird, get in! Get in before they kill you! When did you wake up, lovebird? We're finally together, my love. Finally. You're Miss Tijuana Fair. Do we know each other? This is no time for jokes. Your passport is in the glove compartment. Take it out. Remember to say we're just going shopping for the day. Don't say a thing about the house or my little business, okay? What would I say? I can't remember anything. Even better. I'll make you remember everything... in spades. And they took off in the Beetle you gave her. Look. Watch the border in shifts. That bastard will come back to Tijuana. The homeland beckons. Also he can't live without Doña Chocha's tacos. It would have been better if he had died. That way it wouldn't hurt so much. But you said everything was going great. That's the worst part. For a moment there, I was on cloud nine. After he came back, he treated me differently. I thought it was a miracle, but I was wrong. Maybe we need to pray more. What's going on here? Nothing, Chief. She's crying because her bike has a flat tire. Well, it's only natural to get attached to your vehicle. -Excuse me. -Of course. Have a good day. We finally got the mattress we ordered. Come here. This is the soft side and this is the hard side. Yes, it's soft. Which one should we try first? The hard one? Neither. No, lovebird. We have 70 months left to pay it off. But we'll make it worth the price. -No. -Yes! -Hold on, lady. -I missed you, lovebird. Do you know what the problem is? I haven't taken my vitamins for a long time. Yes. This is wrong. -What's wrong? -This is wrong, lady. What happened, lovebird? This is the hard side. Lovebird, are you okay? What's wrong? Lady, I can't do this. I am a faithfully married man. Who is getting divorced for me. Come on, give me a kiss. Come, my love. Yes, you like it this way. No. Not this way, lovebird. Lady. Miss Tijuana Fair, settle down for a moment, please. I don't remember anything. Miss Tijuana Fair, lovebird? What’s wrong with you? You don't remember anything? You don't remember these? That cost us $10,000? Oh, God. Good investment, but... And the $5,000 we've saved for the liposuction you want me to get? -Lipo what? -Liposuction. Doesn't matter. What you need to remember is that we can't go back to Tijuana, all right? Because the mayor is going to kill you and then me. Why is he going to kill us? Because he found out that I love you and not him... since before I was pretty. Do not take this the wrong way, miss. You're so beautiful. But I can’t... Lovebird, I waited for you for 90 days. Ninety days. If you only knew how long I've been waiting. Saved by the bell! Damn you! I just realized you want to send me straight to Hell. If I stay here, for committing adultery. If I go back to my wife, the mayor will kill me. Or she might kill me herself. It's not gonna happen. Because I'm gonna sort out Pedro Guadalupe’s life and win my granddaughter’s affection. How do you like that? Relax, honey. Come here, lovebird. Meet my star clients, Yéssica and Berenice. Believe it or not, they're mother and daughter. Madam, excuse my boldness, but your daughter is very pretty. I'm the daughter. Sorry, I meant to say you look like sisters. Ignore me. -Excuse me. -Where are you going? Just out to stretch my legs. Okay, wait. Bring two vegan chickens for dinner. Don't forget the change. Yeah, sure. Very pretty, mirror images. Excuse me. He's so hot. Oh, God. Sorry, but I’m not allowed to provide information about our students. But does she study here, miss? I didn't say that. But it says so right here. Are you really a Pedro Infante impersonator? I'm even better than he is. I don't believe you. No? What do you need, exactly? HEAVEN Good afternoon. With or without worm? -What? -You're more of a tequila guy. Do I look like a drunk? Table for one? I'm looking for Jenny Infante. Her break is at 8:15. Raquelita, I don't mean to interfere in something that's not my business, but marriage is sacred. Your aunt and I have been together for almost 50 years. Give Pedrito Guadalupe another shot. We can talk to him. Don't you dare! I don't ever want to see him again. Raquelita, come on. So? Should we triple the bet? Jenny! Are you the one who’s looking for me? Do you remember me? Of course. You were the best impersonator of my grandfather. Why did you say what you said? What did I say? That your grandfather didn't treat women well. Did you come all the way here to stand up for him? Don't tell me you impersonate his macho side too. What? No way, I could never... I’m not macho or a womanizer. The woman I kissed at the fair is my wife. That's why I lost, for being faithful. Unlike the Chinese guy who won. He was exactly like Pedro Infante. He must have a Chinese woman on each arm. I brought you this picture. As you can see, I'm nobody's granddaughter here. I don't really like going to those events, but it helps pay the rent. Sorry, but I have to get back. We're really busy tonight. Yes. What's your name again? Pedro. Pedro Guadalupe. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, miss. Thanks. Hello. Raquelita, just give me a few days to sort this out. I promise you... Hello? I wonder where lovebird went to get the chicken? I even bought him the vitamins he asked for. Hey, Josué, where are you from? San Juan de los Lagos. And you? From Mazatlán. I mean Tijuana. I’m from Tijuana. What are you doing here? There are too many impersonators of your grandfather in Tijuana, so I came here to make some money to win back my wife. Then you don't behave as well as you say. I'd like to be better, but you know what they say. Old habits die hard. -Well, at least you're trying. -That's right. Yes, sir. That's "Chimichanga." Jenny? No, the manager. He thinks he's Mexican, but he's Texan. What a crazy guy. -Pedro! -Yes, boss! I'm teaching them how to make guacamole the right way. With sour cream, to use fewer avocados. My friend, you just have to rinse the dishes. We have two dishwashers. I thought I was the dishwasher. As long as I don't have to share my salary with you. Oh, my God. Toño. That girl is a little cold with him. Let me soften up her a bit. Watch this. Goodbye. -What's up? -Enough. Okay, I'm done. Done. Thank you very much. Where's the tip jar? Not bad for a mariachi. Toño, please close up. Welcome to Heaven, Pedro. Jenny, it's getting late. Do you want me to walk you home? Thanks, but my roommate is coming to get me. Your what? Yeah, my roomie. We split the rent. Help! Let him go! Get up. Are you okay, man? I owe you one. -Are you okay, miss? -Yes, thank you. -I'm glad to help. -I'm okay, yeah. Thank you. Are you okay? Ready for another 14 rounds. See you tomorrow. You saw how dangerous it is here. I'll stay with you until your ride gets here. How can you impersonate someone else's life all the time? I don't imitate just anybody. Pedro Infante was a great man with a big heart. A big heart. Too big, according to my grandmother. To him, she was just one of many. Where is your grandmother? I'll set her straight. -Are you okay? -Just a little headache I get sometimes. Where did you say your grandmother was? She died eight years ago. She was still so beautiful. I don't doubt it. If my idol had anything, it was good taste. Want a ride? That's Kogo, my roomie. Could you drop me off at the border? I want to see my wife. Sure, come on. Good night. Don't be late. Chimichanga is a little particular. -Don't worry. -Bye. If you take another step, I'll arrest you for trespassing. Would you really turn your handsome husband in to the authorities, ma'am? I am the authority here. And you made the decision not to be my husband anymore. But I told you, I can't remember anything from before the coma. I don't even remember if I have parents or sisters. I only know I have you, Raquelita. Don't worry. They live in Yucatán and they don't want to hear from you either. Then tell me, how bad was I? You betrayed the only person who stood by you through it all no matter what. Yes, woman, but-- I always knew you were a womanizer, but so heartless as to ask for a divorce? I'm the one who should have asked for it, many times. But don't worry. I'll sign the papers tomorrow and take them to your lawyer. Burn those goddamn papers. Marriage is forever, Raquelita. Just give me a chance to win you back. Since I woke up, our love was love at first sight. You are so cynical. I agree. But I adore you. Even when you shoot at me. I swear, I've never met a woman like you. And you never will. Uncle! Since when are you into drunkards? -Don't stop, darling. -Oh, God! What just happened? Oh, God! O Holy St. Anthony. This is the good one. Thank you. Your tips. Thank you. What do you think? They were still good. They just needed a little care. In this life, you have to know how to do everything. Jenny. I noticed that you don't have as many hours this week. -Did Chimichanga cut your hours? -No, I asked for time off. I have an exam on the history of women's rights. And I want to attend a conference on sexism in immigrant communities. I thought you were studying law. I was going to ask you for help annulling my petition for divorce. Wait, what? It's fresh! Just kidding! You see, I asked my wife for a divorce to run away with her cousin. But I swear to you, I don't remember anything about it. Sorry, but that's the worst excuse I've ever heard in my entire life. I was in a coma. -Are you serious? -I swear. They all say I was a womanizer. Like a good impersonator of my grandfather. You definitely should have won first place. Why don't you help me? How can I, Pedro? I want to win back my wife, and learn how to behave. How to be faithful. You mean get rid of your sexism? Whatever it's called. I think the first step would be not getting involved with any cousin. You're married, Pedro. You have to put yourself in her shoes. You have to see things from her perspective, you know? You speak beautifully. Continue, I'm all ears. Hold on, I'm no psychologist. Why don't you ask for the day off and come with me to the conference? You have to start somewhere. What's the deal with that Kogo guy? Are you living in sin with him? Of course not. Are you crazy? We're just friends. We just split the rent. And he gets to practice his Spanish with me. He's developing a video game about drug dealers versus ninjas. With all due respect, I don't believe men and women can be just friends. Do you live in one of my grandfather's films or what? If you only knew. -See you later. -Have a good one. What's up, Billy? No, the same girl, Billy. Raquelita. Listen to me. I want this to work. I'm seeing a psychologist to help me behave properly. A psychologist, or another hussy? What are you talking about? Let yourself be surprised. You're a strong woman. You always have been. You've had to struggle so much. What have you got to lose? Let's plan something together. Let's go to Acapulco this Christmas, or wherever you want. Give me a chance to win you over. To make you fall in love. No. What is it? It's very hard for a man to change. I'm a new man. I-- I've forgiven you too many times. Leave. Please, leave. All right. The sweetest kisses of both of my lives. Uncle! What are you doing awake, young lady? You need to help my aunt pay the hospital bills. Her insurance didn't cover anything. My mom had to give her some of her sleeping pills. Why didn't she tell me? Because you're in recovery. Don't tell anyone that I told you, okay? Laura, I was up late last night fixing the chairs -and then I was too tired to go home. -This is how I wanted to catch you. -You've been sleeping here. -Of course I haven't. I checked the security tapes to prove I'm not crazy. You mean those little things are video cameras? And what did you see? I saw you taking a bath. -What else? -Everything. -Every little thing? -Everything. All of it. Hold on, woman. Hold on. Even though I didn't take all my vitamins... Nobody rejects a free meal, right? I wouldn't want to faint. -What now? -I'm a married man. That's never stopped a mariachi, much less a charro. Let's go to my house. Chimichanga arrives at 10:00. I think I'm in love with my wife. -Why did you kiss me, then? -I don't know. Sometimes I get carried away. Get carried away again. I'm a one-mare charro now. I saw the door open. Laura, what are you doing here so early? Did you come to help us make the guacamole? No. She almost grabbed my avocados. I will always be with you. What if he's really changed? Men only change for the worse. The slacker never gave her a dime. This won't fix everything, but it helps. Blessed money. That's for sure. Maybe it was the medicine that changed him. My uncle is a different person since he started drinking Recto-Bismol. Or maybe it was the full-moon mass that the whole squadron paid for. Back at the fair, he kissed you with so much passion. Yes, he seemed like a new man, partner. And the doctor told you he could have strange lapses and mental behaviors. -Other way around. -Strange... Mental lapses and strange behaviors. I shouldn't have skipped work. This isn't exactly the American Dream. How am I going to help Raquel? I earn more tips at Heaven. Look at that. Pedro, I don't know why you called us. Let's go back to Tijuana. They're even offering us housing there. Afternoon, Officer. What song do you want to hear? -You can't be here. -Why not? That Chinese guy again? He's Korean, not Chinese, and he got his permit last week. All right. Just to be clear, that man is not Pedro Infante. He is an impostor endorsed by the government of the USA. Let's go, guys. Damned Chinese chauvinist. Sorry, miss. I made you cold all over. Allow me. Don't want you to catch a cold. You bastard. Idiot! The Filipino revolutionary Apolinario Silang used to say, "One man for all women and all women for one man." Boys from these communities need new models of masculinity that don't expect women to tolerate infidelity. This next one is a Mexican idol. Pedro Infante, a very talented singer. When asked about his marital status, he would answer that he was single, but his wife was married. And we could go on like this forever. -You found her? -Yes. So, what do I tell her? Tell her the green dress is the prettiest. Hey, but according to the expert, quinceañera parties also perpetuate sexism, right? In a way, they do. This is like a minefield. Just like those mengans, who are so sensitive to everything. -Vegan, Pedro. -Yeah, whatever. YOUR UNCLE LIKES THE GREEN ONE. WHAT UNCLE? I DON'T HAVE A JAPANESE UNCLE HAHA, SEE YOU NEVER, FREAK. WAIT! OR I'LL TELL YOUR MOM WHO BROKE THE PORCELAIN FIGURES UNCLE, WHERE ARE YOU? Ask her to find out how much money her aunt owes. Let me see. Look at that! And I'm the one they want to send to Hell. They are contestants on MexaTV. It is a sign from Heaven. And now Pedro Guadalupe imitates the great Pedro Infante. PEDRO GUADALUPE RAMOS PEDRO INFANTE IMPERSONATOR Turn on the TV! My uncle is on MexaTV! 911 in Spanish. What's your emergency? It's been days since my fiancé went missing. His name is Pedro Guadalupe Ramos. You have won this envelope containing $1,000! You can either keep it and walk away, or you can go for it all! What could Pedro Guadalupe Ramos win? All, I'm going for it all All, I'm going for it all Behind those doors, there's an all-inclusive trip to an exotic destination, a luxury car with a value of up to $30,000. And a surprise prize! You get to choose. Pick a door, or keep the $1,000. All, I'll go for it all. All, he's going for it all $30,000. $15,000 for the hospital bills, the other 15,000, I'll double at the track. Is there a girl you would like to share your prize with? -No, sir. -What? -Not just any girl. -No? With my wife, Raquel Andrade. Raquelita, God gave me a second chance. I'm gonna prove to you that I'm a new man. You'll see. I'll get you through. -Very nice, very nice! Okay. -You see, Aunt? He adores you. Now, tell us. Which door do you choose? The first one! Maybe the second? The one in the middle. Are you sure? A good Mexican never backs down! Let's open the door in the middle! All, he lost it all Pedro takes home everything he needs to open his own horchata business. Let him stay there. That oaf is not good enough for you. A round of applause for Pedro Guadalupe and his wife, Raquel! He was in a coma. He doesn't know how to get back. You'll see. I'll get you through. He said your name without blinking. The TV doesn't lie, partner. Did God grant me the whole miracle? Reviving and fixing him? Poor thing, where is he sleeping? We have to find him. Otherwise, your dad is gonna set you up with the chief. Yeah. -Good morning. -Good morning. Better the devil you know. You have to give Pedro Guadalupe one last chance. If I were in your life, you would have picked the right door. Thirty grand. Imagine, Pedro. You wouldn't be washing dishes. With that money, I'd go back to Mexico. Don't worry, Josué. My luck will change. The smell gets worse every time, Samantha. To be beautiful, we must endure some smells, Tina. I have to look great for the next fight. There will be a lot of wealthy cattle ranchers there. Just don't make the redhead suffer. He treats you like a queen. I'd like a little of that. I'll send him over, so you can clean him up a bit. Come in. -Who's that dude? -I know where your lovebird is. Oh, no! He's been taken by the MS-16! -Hand over the reward, ma'am. -Right, the reward. Wait. -First, tell me where he is! -First, the dough. You have no idea! You don't know where he is. -Get out of here! Get out! -You're crazy! Let me see, girl. It's thanks to this man's voice that I said yes to the redhead. Be more careful, miss. You're missing your front license plate, Chema. Also, we're not in England. You have the most illegal car I've ever seen in my life. Please don't fine me. I'm broke. Ever since Pedro went into a coma, we haven't played a note. I even asked Narciso to lend me a zonkey to make some money. You know where Pedro Guadalupe is, don't you? If you let the fine go, I'll take you to him. Tell me where he is or I'll arrest you for attempted bribery. -Raquel. -Chema. Plus you're missing your '98 registration sticker. A table for the lady. A bottle of tequila on my tab. This is Miss Tijuana. I'll be right back. -Who's that? -That's the cousin. The reason for everything. Take a bite! Take a bite! Take a bite! Take a bite! Take a bite! Take-- What a mess. I'll get a cloth. You must be behind this. Damn you. Table for one? -Raquelita. -Pedro. What are you doing here? Well... I came to tell you that if you've really changed, maybe we deserve another shot. Of course we deserve it! But let's talk outside. Chimichanga doesn't allow romances or reconciliations. Oh, God. You? What is she doing here? What are you doing here? After all I've done for us, you're going back to her? Us? What does she mean? You had to find out at some point. -She's drunk. Don't listen to her. -No, I'm not drunk. What's wrong with you? -I can't believe it. -Tell her! Tell her what you said to me. That she didn't make you happy. Tell her! You see how you are! Don't listen to her, Raquelita. Let's go talk. I can explain. You are the lowest of the low. I don't know how I could love you like I did. I even mortgaged the house to pay for the hospital to keep you alive. No, no. Sorry, but it was me who kept him alive. -What are you talking about? -Whispering our plans to him. -Keeping up his hopes. -What? -It was me! -What we needed was money, not whispers. I didn't hear anything. You're my wife and I want to be with you. You're dead to me. You never came back. You hear me? You can go to Hell. -Raquel! -You're staying with me! -Raquel. -You're staying right here. It's obvious he's not into you. Musicians like to change songs. Don't they, Pedro, baby? Who's this skank? Idiot! These are made from real hair! Lovebird! Lovebird! -Should I call the police? -Better call the insane asylum. Sorry, miss. Happy birthday! -Don't keep them all for yourself. -Tame them and they are all yours. Raquel! You came down to fix things, not to make them worse. It's time we take him with us. Hold on. Take me where? Give me some credit. The temptation has been unbearable. This city is like a nude beach and I've resisted. -Pedro Guadalupe left me a mess. -Because he followed in your footsteps. Give me more time, please. I even signed up for a seminar on sexism. We grant you a week. A week is not enough! No more. Goodbye. You can't do this to me now that I'm in love with Raquel. At least give me a fortnight. Face me, you cowards! I know it's you, Pedro. If you keep this up, I'll get a restraining order. Raquelita. I only called to say goodbye. What do you like most about your wife? I've never met a woman like her. So fierce and tender at the same time. Then find a way to be with her. That's what I've been trying to do. But the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. She's about to lose her house because of me, and I can't help her... without a job. You have to do something. There's nothing to do. Let's see. If you want her to trust you again, you'll have to win her over with actions. Do you know what I admire the most about my grandfather? His tenacity. He never gave up. -I hope you like it. -Thank you. You should record an album with me. -We would make millions. -Yeah, sure. -You sang "Happy Birthday" beautifully. -Yeah, right. Your grandpa would be so proud. You think so? Imagine, a granddaughter, with a law degree. Who wants to protect the rights of women against chauvinists like him. So what? He'd understand that times have changed. Milagros texted. What does she say? She says Raquel owes $15,000. Oh, man. I'd like to help you. I just don't know how. Don't worry about it. I should be helping you. I've got to go. There are sandwiches in the fridge, okay? If you need anything, you can ask Kogo. Jenny. Thank you for letting me stay here. Don't thank me. This is your home. -Now what? -Hold on. Look. It was my grandpa's. My dad gave it to me the last time I saw him. Before my mom and I moved here to the States. We can pawn it, it'll mean one payment. No, I can't accept this. Where is your dad? -Pedro, are you okay? -Yes. -You should see a doctor. -No, I'm fine. What were you saying? Well, my dad is probably in Mexico City... with a new woman, not thinking about us. Thank you, but I can't. Thank you for everything. Naked guys! Where are you, damn it? Come for me. I can't fix this. Raquel is about to lose everything because of me. My granddaughter... is alone because of the horrible example I set. We are all like this. Skirt chasers through and through. And you! You're just the same. I can see it in your eyes. Stop pretending. And you're well on your way, buddy. There's no pill to make it go away. Cuchis, isn't that the lovebird? Let's get out of here, before he grabs something. You think I forgot that you left me high and dry? And in debt over a mattress? -I need to talk to you. -I don't want to. I can't. I'm with a customer. Leave. Now. Can we talk in private? The redhead doesn't speak Spanish. Say what you want to say. First of all, I'm sorry I didn't bring you any vegan chicken. I couldn't find any anywhere. You must've been hungry all night. This is your apology? I know I might have promised you a lot of things, and that I led you on. but I don't want to hurt you, Samantha. -You're a beautiful woman. -I know that. You're the one who doesn't seem to know. But, darling, I wish I could convince you that I do. If I could split myself in two, I swear I would be here with you. But the truth is... I'm in love with your cousin Raquel. In any case, she is my legitimate wife. No! -The lawyer said so. -That's another issue. What's most important is... that I need your help. Raquel is about to lose her house because of me. So, what do you want? The $5,000 you said we had saved. Didn't you lose your memory? I lost the money. It's gone. Where? At the mall. You broke my heart. I lost the $5,000. You should leave now. Leave, leave. Let me work. The redhead's scalp is gonna burn. You really spent it all? All of this costs, lovebird. Aren't you the guy that sings at Heaven? Didn't you say he doesn't speak Spanish? You stood up for me against the bad hombre for no reason. You have a great swing. I didn't recognize you with the cap and all that stuff on your head. Don't listen to him. Love... I owe you one. You want a job? I need a sparring partner. If there's good money, I'm in. -Do you have a passport? -Of course he does, but no. He can't go back to Tijuana. If he does, he's a dead man. Of course I can go back. Of course I can. You knocked out one of our challengers. I'm sorry. I got carried away. Are you okay? Let me fight for real. You know I need the money. Honey, come here. Dad, what are you doing here? Thank the chief because he has offered to bring the sodas -for Milagros' quinceañera. -But, Dad... What color will your dress be? So I can bring you a matching orchid. Red. How daring! Excuse me. -Of course, Chief. -See you. What are you doing? Securing your future. Ramiro's been drinking. If he gets knocked out right away, we can put Pedro in. Look at his right hook. With two challengers for Tony, we can get the audience going and double the bets. -Like this? -More to the side. But he has to improve his posture. Train him, so he can get rid of that stance from last century. -Pedro, where are you? -Here in Tijuana. Kogo told me you took all your stuff. Yes, I did, because I have a fight this weekend. I'm the challenger in the main event. With God's help, I can make a lot of money. Hold on, you're not a real boxer, okay? We can find another solution. No, Jenny. I'm out of time. Tony just knocked out Ramiro. He didn't even last the first round. Are you sure you want to fight? Yes. I'll give you $1,000 for each round you remain standing. Thank you so much. Make sure they're tight. Thank you, blondie. Sammy, you look great. Use less gel so the caramel color stands out. Thank you. What are you doing here? I came to tell you that the mayor is here. Let's scram. -Did he come with you? -No, he doesn't know I'm here. Why is he here, then? He's betting the town's money. How do I know? Let's go. We can give it another try. Maybe one day you’ll wake up and remember everything in a flash. Samantha, please understand. For the first time, I'm a one-woman man. Forgive me, but... I can't. Besides, I have to get in that ring so I can help Raquel. Are you sure you don't remember anything, lovebird? Are you sure there's nothing left between us? I'm sorry. I think that being in a coma changed me for good. Either way, you have to get out of here. Let's go. Actually, I didn't spend all the money we saved. I have $2,000 of the 5,000 left... that actually was 7,000, but since you didn't remember, so I said it was 5,000. I already made a down payment on my next lipo, but I'll give it to you. As long as you leave now, please. Five minutes! Lovebird, you don't even know how to fight. You told me you ran away from bullies in kindergarten. Listen. I'm fighting! If the ring doesn't kill you, the mayor's men will, lovebird. I'm not a lovebird. I'm Pedro. They're the ones that put you in a coma when they found out about our plans. Really? So it was them. If you want to do something for me... then pray. Because my life is in God's hands. Lovebird... Let's go, guys. Box. Go! Tony! He already died once. What does he want? He'll get beaten to a pulp. -Tony! Tony! Tony! -One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... He brought this slaughter on himself. Punch him, bro. Breathe, breathe. That's it. Put it on Tony. Sorry I'm late. -I've made $7,000. -Are you okay? Let go! Let go! Step back. Go! One... two... three.. four... five. Let go! Let go! Let go! Step back. You already know, up and down. I'm stopping the fight. With the grand that I got for the bracelet, we can get the rest later. But the people are still betting. If I last one more round, will you round up my pay to $15,000? You are the favorite. Come on, you got this. You know you're risking your life, don't you? Get your grandfather's bracelet back. And please, never get rid of it. Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! With a bonus... for you to come back next week, champ. Thank you very much. Don’t trust that girl. Please give this to my wife, Raquel Andrade. He's really changed. Where are you going? I still have one round left. Take care of her. Let's go for a little walk, lovebird. Hey! What are you doing? What? What? Come on, let's go! I need to speak to Officer Raquel Andrade. That's my granddaughter! The next party this family has could be a wedding, Chief. You think so? Your better-than-nothing has been kidnapped. -What? -We got a call from a Jenny Infante. They were in Tecate at a boxing match. The mayor was there, too. It looks like his men pulled a gun on Pedro and took him away. What did he do? Don’t even ask, Raquelita. Save him, or they're gonna kill him. There are a lot of rumors about the mayor. Let's go. Now. -The keys, Chacho. -What? -Give me the keys. -What about the chief? I'll explain later. Wait, I'll get suspended. Attention, women's motor patrol. Andrade here. Locate the mayor's vehicle. They've kidnapped... my husband! We're in Tijuana. Road signs are optional. Okay. -Go. -Step on it. And to think we voted for that bastard. Yeah, right. Vehicle, move to your right. Let the patrol through. Take that one! We're gonna lose them. Both vehicles just merged on Heroes Avenue. Over. Attention, women's motor patrol. Andrade here. Follow the patrol. Follow her. Hey! You're not moving cattle. Block him in! Stop! Pull over! Come out with your hands up! What is it, girls? Is there a bomb threat or something? Step out of the car. What a mess Pedro Guadalupe left behind. Put down your weapons. Boys, lower your guns. Watch how you talk to me, girl. Don't forget you all work for me. We work for the people of Tijuana. The people of Tijuana? That's bullshit. Okay, so, what are the charges against me? The kidnapping of Pedro Guadalupe Ramos. Where's your proof? I want all their names. These fools won't work in Tijuana again. They have him in the trunk! Open the trunk! Quickly! Open the trunk! That's an order! Open it! Hey! Let me go! Arrest them. You'll regret this. Hey, be careful! I was just following the mayor's orders. Do something! Lovebird... Oh, no. I have nothing to do with it. I don't even know the guy. It was sort of a blind date. -Thank you. -I was just doing my duty. Because no one is above the law. You and me, we're nothing. What do I have to do for you to forgive me? Why do you have a grievance with the mayor? It's all my fault. My fault and mine alone. Of course you had something to do with this. No, cousin. I did, but not anymore. I should have never gotten involved with Pedro Guadalupe. Forgive me. Better yet, forgive him. He would die for you. He was almost killed in the ring because he was determined to save your house. He asked me to give you this, to pay off your debt. From now on, with me you'll get to win... not lose. And I promise that I will be the man that you deserve. Give him another chance. Or you'll break our hearts. I can't. Leave forever. What going on? What a shame, Chief. Now you're gonna have to wait for him to die again. This is what my grandfather must have been like. I missed you so much, Uncle. I'm glad you're here. What did you drink? My boyfriend gave me a rum and cola. Be careful with that boy. -Next. -Go! Keep an eye on her. You and I are online friends. Dance with me? Always. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. Look at you. I love your curves. Well, I'm glad you like them because... I'm going to get a little curvier. A lot curvier. Are you sure? I love you, Pedro. Don't ever leave me again, you hear me? Never. Something wrong? -Nothing. -I’m betting on you next week. Soon we'll be moving to a fancy neighborhood. Dad, Pedro isn't gonna fight anymore. But, my girl, we have to take advantage of the gifts God gave us. I'm sorry. She's the boss. Besides, I have to take care of myself for Raquelita and for my... I'll convince her. After all, I'm still her father. -Can I dance with her? -Of course. Come here. Guess what? You're gonna be godparents. I just got the best news of my life. I'm going to be a father again. -We know, Pedro. -So? Why haven't you congratulated me? Your week is almost up. No. You can't do that to me. I can't leave Raquel alone now, with the little bundle. You already lived your life. This was just a test. Yes, but not like it was supposed to be. Let me make amends to women. All women, through Raquel. This time I want to do it right. This body is still strong. And I have to be here to support my wife. We're sorry. She has to follow her own path. No, no, don't say that. I have to raise this little baby with Raquel. Let me be with her. Let me be her husband, until death do us part. At the end, if you want, you win. I'll go to Hell forever. But let me be with her. Don't say anything. Talk about it with the big boss. I'm sure He'll say yes. -What are you doing? -Nothing. Getting some air. We want you to sing. Are you all right? Yes. -Are you excited about the baby? -How could I not be? You better take me, studs. There's my son-in-law. I thought you had kicked the bucket again. -No way. -Come sing. Go. We have a whole life ahead of us. -Come sing with me. Yes. -No. Your grandfather loved this one. Doesn't matter if they're born snub-nosed as long as they can breathe. Uncle! Call an ambulance! Hurry! Take the best of your grandfather and let the rest go. Pedro, don't speak, okay? Relax. Tell them to hurry up! Hurry! Forgive me, Raquelita. I won't be able to stay here with you. Please, don't leave again. I love you with all my soul. Do something, please! Uncle. -Oh, wow. -So pretty. Aunty! Aunty! -I also have a present for you. -Let's see it. He's back from the dead! Dedicated to all the women in the world and to the memory of Pedro Infante
