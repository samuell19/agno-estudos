Hi, I'm Catherine Oxenberg. My family was fractured by horrific circumstances, and we were able to come back together again. This is my story. From the outside, it all looked so normal, not like anything you've read about or seen in the movies. There was no creepy compound behind a fence. That would have been a dead giveaway. Instead, the houses were embedded into suburban neighborhoods, just like yours and mine. It was great camouflage. Anyone could have fallen prey. Time to meet your sisters. I see. Well, that's all right, Steven. You don't have to placate me. I'm a big girl. Thank you. Last batch of cranberry crumblers. Nice. If you want to renew your website, Indie, it's only 300 bucks. I mean, what's the point, right? I keep baking, but no one's buying. Two orders a week is not cutting it. What did your agent say? He said no bites on the script, but not to be discouraged. I'm sorry, Mom. Thank you. These smell delicious. Get 'em while they're hot, before I give them to a homeless shelter. If you insist. Next time you come to California, we're taking you surfing. Careful, Rem, your grandmother has never turned down a challenge in her life. I gladly welcome any opportunity to go to the beach with all my girls. - Love you all. - Bye, Eliza-Bird. Have a blast, you guys. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Do one for me? - Here, Dad. Thank you. Let's go, girls. Please keep an eye on them in the water at all times. Always do, Cat. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, Mom. I'm sorry, darling. Creating a successful business can be a difficult road. It's just, I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing anymore. Maybe I should just go back to college. Well, it's always an option. Can I ask you something? Anything, always. Have you ever felt just really lost? More than I care to admit. How'd you snap out of it? Oh, listen, angel. You're still very young. You don't have to have your whole life figured out yet. It's trial and error, all of it. And what you're experiencing is the greatest of all human challenges. Which is? The desire to find your purpose, your happiness. Can't wait till that day comes. What's so funny? Well, what I'm desiring right now, in this very moment, is a big tub of chocolate caramel swirl. Anything but a freaking muffin. Freezer, top shelf. - I'll grab the spoons. - Yes. You seemed pretty intense in there, for a yoga class. Oh, what can I say, Julian? Even if it's yoga, I'm still driven. You do realize it's supposed to ground and center you? Yeah, I've had a lot on my mind lately. - I mean, things with Casper and… - Hmm. And my career's in a bit of a flux. I hear you, sweetie. That's why you're coming with me. Coming with you where? David refuses to go with me to this introductory ESP seminar next weekend, and I could use a wingman. - Good morning. - ESP? Hello. Uh, what's ESP? The NXIVM group's Executive Success Program. Half my theater class has dabbled and swears by it. NXIVM? Never heard of it. You? Queen of "I'll try any self-help program known to man"? Oh, you know me so well, Julian. Yes, I do. And it's a date. Yeah, so what are you doing later? Going for a swim. Wanna come? Hmm, maybe this weekend. Question, darling. - Are you busy next Saturday? - What do you have in mind? Well, Julian is taking me to this how-to-be-better-at-business seminar called ESP, and I thought you might find it interesting. Here you go again. I figured we both could use a little boost right about now. - Tell her it can't hurt. - It can't hurt. - Oh, my God. - Listen to your mom, Indie. She's never steered you wrong. Thank you for that vote of confidence, Lucas. - Bye. - Bye. I'll take that as a yes, then. This Executive Success Program was created by our founder and leader, Keith Raniere. NXIVM's unique technology allows you to uncover, re-examine and integrate those mistaken perceptions. Offering you the tools for removing those errors in cognition and creating consistency. In other words, you're gonna learn all the tricks in the book, so you'll stop getting in your own way all the time. Now I can relate to that. This is much more than just business. It's about learning tools that will create more ethical workplaces. For a very limited time, we're offering our first level of workshops, five classes in all, for only $2,400 per person. And we're here to answer any and all questions that you might have. Hi. Uh, $2,400 for five classes? Wow. Sorry, gals. No one told me about this part. Mom, I want to do this, for me, and I want you to do it with me. I'm willing to give it a shot if you are. - Such a hot day. - It is. Mmm-hmm, I think that's great. And once Nancy gets done with the introductions, then we'll start handing out the questionnaires. We're offering it to half the group. - So we separate into two groups? - Mmm-hmm. - Morning, Prefect. - Good morning, Sarah. - Good morning, Prefect. - Good morning. Prefect? Oh, that's Nancy Salzman. She's NXIVM's co-founder. Um, we do this as a form of respect, just to pay tribute, you know. That's how you should refer to her as well. I'm Sarah Edmondson. I'm a longtime NXIVM coach. Oh, Catherine Oxenberg and my daughter, India. - Hi. - No introduction needed, Catherine. I am a big fan. I'm an actress as well, so… Thank you. Um, what's with all the different colored scarves? Is that like a martial arts thing? It's called a "stripe path." So, a gold sash is the highest ranking one can achieve at NXIVM. Get through this week, you'll earn your first white. Welcome, everyone. Gather around. Our founder and Vanguard, Keith Raniere, welcomes you, too. He is an extraordinary man. He's one of the top three problem-solvers in the world, with an IQ of 240, one of the highest recorded. Your coaches and I will be taking you through the 12-point mission statement. But first, make sure you fill out your questionnaires completely and most importantly, honestly. "What is the worst thing that ever happened to you?" "What have you done that you're most ashamed of?" "What is your greatest fear?" What on earth do these questions have to do with being successful in business? I don't know. They probably want us to think about our life. - India. Come with me. - Yes, Sarah. She's gonna have a more honest experience with all this away from her mother. The first point, and most paramount to Vanguard, his embrace of individualism and selflessness. "There are no ultimate victims. Therefore, I will not choose to be a victim." "There are no ultimate victims. Therefore, I will not choose to be a victim." "I promise to share and enroll people in ESP" and their mission for my own benefit, "and to make the world a better place to live." "I promise to share and enroll people in ESP" and their mission for my own benefit, "and to make the world a better place to live." - Uh, if I might, Nancy. - Prefect. Just during workshops. Uh, Perfect, right. Um, I have a real problem with that last one. My daughter and I didn't sign up to recruit other people. I mean, that's your job. The idea that I can't share my experiences with my family or friends, that's just simply unrealistic, isn't it? Well, you already agreed when you signed the non-disclosure agreement in your welcome package. You all did. Now, if you're all right, may I continue with the workshop? Success is a interior state of clear and honest awareness of who you are, your value in the world and your responsibility for your reactions to all things. Slandering or libeling someone, it's okay to make judgments. You just want to preface your comments with, "In my opinion." Mirroring or copying other's body language is an ingenious way to build rapport and influence business associates. Catherine. You were falling asleep because you have defiance issues. I don't have defiance issues. That's not fair. No, what's unfair is if you do not allow us to help you work on them. I don't like it. I don't like Little Miss All-Obsessed telling me what I can or cannot do or say or feel. Who would have thought you'd be the class troublemaker? And who is this Keith Vanguard guy anyway? The Wizard of Oz? And why do they keep separating us? I wanted to do this with you, alongside you. I don't mind being in other groups. It's not a big deal. I'm getting a lot out of it. They're bringing up a lot of challenging questions and ideas I've never really thought about before. We have one class left. So maybe stop resisting and show Nancy that you do want to find your own purpose and happiness. You really do hear me sometimes. - Sometimes. - All right. I will try my best to let Nancy hold my bare feet to the fire. Thank you. Vanguard calls these exercises EMs, exploration of meanings. They are meant to unhook emotional charges around painful life memories and to dismantle phobias. Who would like to be our first volunteer? Catherine. Thank you. Catherine… Your questionnaire was quite revealing, Catherine. Thank you for your honesty. You're welcome. You mentioned when you were 16, that your father acted quite violently toward you. He grabbed you by the throat and shoved you into a wall. Had you know then that that would be the worst thing that he ever did to you, would that have lessened your fear in that moment? Yes, I suppose so. See, men get terrified when they are losing control of their children. Um, they often will react violently, but that is about his insecurity. His grabbing you had nothing to do with you. It did not mean he didn't love you. It certainly did not mean that you were unlovable. You, um, you have allowed others to have power over you. You also mentioned an uncle touching you inappropriately when you were… You were young. Yes, I was five. This pattern… This pattern of unfaithful men, directors in your auditions, making you feel paralyzed. Why? Why? - I don't know. - Yeah, you do, Catherine. Say it. It's okay. Because, um… Because each room I'd walk into could potentially be another room where I'd be abused. Yes. You formed a false belief about men in power hurting you. But now that you see it, you're free. You are free. I love you. Thank you. What are you doing, Cat? Two weeks away for female empowerment classes? It's called Jness, and I've already paid for it. Where are you two gonna stay? I mean, it's Albany, for crying out loud. Mark and Bonnie have a townhouse and they've invited us to stay. Does Bill know you're taking his daughter across the country? I don't have to consult with Bill. Thank you very much. Maria will help you with the girls. And I'll be back before you know it. - Let me help you with that. - I've got it. Cat, please. This isn't about you, Casper, or us. I am doing this for me and for India. I want us to have something to share together. The NXIVM business model has allowed for Mark and me to travel back and forth to L.A., and we owe that all to Keith and the community that he's created here. Yes, we're looking forward to finally meeting Keith. Mmm-hmm. Just so you know, Danny and Jennifer will be staying in here. You'll meet them later. And this is your room. The, um, first class is this afternoon, at 3 p.m., so please make yourselves at home. Thank you. We built the Jness program on the foundation of pure female empowerment. I can assure you that it is the most gratifying thing that I have ever been a part of. That's Allison Mack. She played Chloe on Smallville. I come from a world where I was used to an objective being met. I was used to strict, hard deadlines, and a lot of fear and punishment if I didn't get something right. But with Jness, the teachings come from a place of pure self-motivation, self-direction, and watching so many other women evolve and transform in a way that is so pure. So I want to welcome you all here today to begin this journey. I want everyone to raise their hands in the air. Come on, go ahead. Okay, higher. See how high you can get. Get higher. How come none of you stood up? Hmm? On your feet? Or even on your chair? I don't know. You could've gone so much higher, but you didn't. Because we all have limiting beliefs. We all believe that we are only supposed to do the things that are socially acceptable. I mean, think about all the things that are holding you back. You don't need permission to do anything. Decide this is my life, and I'm gonna go for it. Catherine! When I heard that you signed up, I was so elated. Oh, thank you. And you must be India. - Hi. - What a beauty you are. That was so thought-provoking in there. I hope all your classes are that inspiring. Oh, me too. I mean, it's really so simple, isn't it? Be available to your infinite possibilities, not your limitations. Do you mind if I steal her for a while? Oh, um, go ahead. - I'll find Bonnie and meet you later. - Okay. - Come on. - See you later, Mom. - Do you like going on walks? - I do. How long have you been doing this, Allison? I mean, it's a long ways from Hollywood. It certainly is. I took my first class about, um, eight years ago. I guess I had, on the surface, something that seemed like the perfect life. My first big acting job, the dog, the nice car. The boyfriends, the clothes, the house. I mean, that sounds like the perfect life to me. It was everything that I thought I needed to be okay, and yet, it was crazy. I just had sort of accepted you live your life inauthentically. But that all changed for you here? Absolutely. When I came to NXIVM and started to do the work, to really do the work in the classes, it started to change my life in ways that I never expected. It's truly astounding to be present and enlightened. You want that too, don't you? Yeah. I do. I am so privileged to have Keith as my mentor. He just wants the best for all of us, especially the women here. I can promise you that you will find more answers and meaning here than… anywhere else. All you have to do is trust me. Trust me. Trust Keith. Oh, this is Jennifer. Jennifer, Catherine. - Hi, Catherine. - Hi. Jennifer's staying in the room next to you. Oh. - Is that the Vanguard? - Yes. All right, I got this. Here we go, hut! So is this midnight volleyball game a form of male bonding? Oh, you have no idea. The men live for this. Yeah, that was out. Oh, come on, that was not out, Mark. You know it. Huh, come on now. Let's do it, over here, game point, right here. - Set! - Yeah! Vanguard! Vanguard! Vanguard! Vanguard! Vanguard! Vanguard! Vanguard! Vanguard! This is India Oxenberg. Why do I get the feeling I'll never lose another game now that you're here? Oxenberg? That must be your lovely mother. I'm a fan. What you'll continue to find in the Jness modules is Vanguard's truth about men, women and male-female relationships. The fact that men don't experience intimacy. They don't? Why do you say that? Well, imagine the difference between you sticking your finger into someone's mouth and then someone sticking their finger into yours. The first one is not intimate. The second one is. That's what sex is like for men. I'm not sure I buy that. Men are more loyal than women. When a man cheats, he goes back to his wife. When a woman cheats, she tends to transfer her affections and then leave her primary relationship. That's what you call loyalty? I'm sorry, but I have to stop you there. And I… I'm not trying to be defiant, I swear. But for a program that's supposed to be about female empowerment, I mean, this is anything but. You're allowed to question the philosophy, Catherine. No, please stay seated. In some ways, it's important that we do. We didn't get a chance to officially meet. Vanguard. I don't pretend to know all the answers to the great philosophical question of what truly separates men and women. But we do a great favor here for women, seeking out their flaws and weaknesses, and bringing it to their attention so they can learn and grow. My God, Jennifer. What are you doing lying on the floor like that? Mmm. I'm doing penance. Penance? Penance for what? For being defiant to my husband. He made you sleep on the floor? Mmm-mmm, he didn't make me. It's my choice. It's what I'm doing for my personal growth. - Can I at least get you a blanket? - I'm fine. Sorry I startled you. I'll see you in the morning. Hey. Hey. Mom, you okay? Yeah, we need to get out of here. What's wrong? This place is too weird. I think we should leave in the morning. Mom, stop. I don't want to go. I want to stay. Why? There… are so many classes I want to take, and I mean, like, what's waiting for me back home? Your sisters, your friends. Lucas. Well, they can all wait. I'm here now. And I wanna figure out who I really am and what I want. Darling, I'm worried about leaving you here all by yourself. I'm not by myself. I have all these amazing women around me. Allison, especially. But if you want to go, you can go. But I'm gonna stay. The last thing I want to do is hold you back from something that you believe in. I'm good here. I feel like I'm right where I'm supposed to be. You're sure? All right. - Love you, Mom. - I love you. I really like this next question. If happiness were a national currency, what kind of work would make you rich? I think that my answer to that would be bringing together the people that I love. That's actually kind of what I do with Jness. I mean, we use tools and structures and we create these incredible relationships with one another and the bonds that we form are everlasting and fill my heart with such happiness that I guess you could say I'm as rich as Jeff Bezos. Oh, you know what? Before I go, hang on a second. Hey, India, come here. Come say hello. You guys. This is my roomie, India. Isn't she the cutest? All right, until next time. Bye! So I hope you are ready for lunch, because I am starting a new diet. No more than 800 calories a day. I have been reading up on the health benefits of strict calorie reduction. It increases mental clarity, boosts energy, sex drive, and it reduces inflammation. But you're so skinny already. I need to be skinnier. The truth is… men like that. Keith likes that. It, uh, hurts him when I'm heavier, it hurts his energy field. He told you that? Keith and I have a very special bond. And part of his mentoring requires me to check in with him every day. I could make us a really good honey mustard dressing. Mmm. Too fattening, girl. We are never going to get to 106 like that. I told Keith how impressed I was with all your dedication to the coursework. There hasn't been one workshop I haven't absolutely loved. I know. I see it every day. And with a little bit more dedication, you could even be a shadow coach by this fall. Me? Shadow coach? Do you really think I'm ready? Mmm-hmm, I do. But I really need you to start focusing on recruiting new members, constantly, 24/7. Family, friends on social media. And if you build your own network, maybe you could start earning a salary or a commission. I absolutely will. I'm in. So what do you think? That is Clare Bronfman. She and her sister are big financial supporters of Keith. For many years. And, she just bought the building. Isn't this the perfect location for a cute little cafe of our own? - Cafe? - Mmm-hmm. Allison, that's always been my dream. I'll oversee it. You'll be my right hand. I can't believe you guys are all doing this for me. I told you. Keith is all about giving back. And as long as he's reciprocated accordingly, he'll do anything for you. Let me go introduce you to Clare. Come on. - Mother. - Hello, darling. Hello, let me take those. Oops. - Sweetheart. - Mmm. Oh, it's so good to see you. How was the flight? Fifteen hours sitting next to the most interesting man alive. What was it about him that you found so interesting? I didn't say I found him so interesting. He found himself so interesting. - Mmm. - Well, there you have it. The divorce is official. - Are you all right? - Oh, it was over a long time ago. I'm grateful India will be coming home for her birthday. Well, I will say, whenever she or I speak or text, she sounds terrific. I suppose she is. But I guess I just… I never imagined that she'd get as caught up in this group as she has. I mean, this whole year, she's barely been back for a visit. It would just be nice if she came back to visit for more than a weekend here and there. What is it? I don't know. The man that founded NXIVM, and the women that help him run it, I mean, there is something oddly misogynistic about them. Have you shared your concerns with India? Every time I say something critical about NXIVM, she gets defensive. And I want to give her the dignity to try and figure things out for herself. Like you did with me. Your firstborn is having a birthday. Don't let it cause you anxiety. It's time to celebrate her. How surreal is this, huh? We blink once and we have a baby daughter. Blink twice and she's a woman, with the world at her feet. It's all the years in between that mattered the most. I hope those parts aren't too hazy for you, Bill. If you need me, I will be at the bar. Does she seem okay to you? Oh, I think she looks confident and content. No judging. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Speech! Speech! Okay, Dad. All right, if you insist. Um, first of all, I have to thank my mom for throwing this amazing party for me. And to my Eliza-Bird, my grandmother, for flying all the way to be here. I know you're not really supposed to say out loud what you wish for on your birthday, or it might not come true. But my wish is a big one this year, and it comes from a place of… …pure love. My life has changed so much this past year in so many positive ways and from so many incredible people, and I've learned so much about myself since I joined NXIVM. And my birthday wish this year is for everyone here to take a NXIVM workshop, whether it's ESP, Jness, Mobius, or you can even join me next month for V-Week, Vanguard Week, where we celebrate the birthday of our founder, Keith Raniere. Yeah, so it's… it's only $2,000 for the week, and that includes food and a place to stay. Who wants some cake? I would. Champagne, please. It's time to cut the crap. Can you please come back down to planet Earth now? What are you implying, Lucas? I mean, it's like, you totally ghosted all of us. I mean, what's happened to you? What kind of drugs are you on? I'm not on any drugs. I meant every word I said. Let me sign you both up and you'll see what I'm talking about. Darling, I don't want you recruiting for NXIVM at your own birthday party. - It's not okay with me. - What do you mean? It was only for V-Week. Angel, I understand that you want to share your experiences, but come on. Why don't we take a vacation? You, me, Remy, Francesca. Just us girls. You can choose wherever you want to go. Santorini, Cabo, Hawaii. Did I hear someone say something about going to Greece? Um, I want you to hear this too, Dad. I've decided to enroll in NXIVM University full-time. That way, I can become a full-time coach and then an instructor, unlimited coursework, and I can take classes as many times as I like. It's only $50,000 for the year. - Fifty thousand? - I don't expect you to pay for it. I have my inheritance now. I'm gonna pay for it all myself. I don't understand what you find so upsetting, Mom. Maybe it's time to let her make her own decisions. I try. She's as enthusiastic as I have ever seen her. You left home when you were, what, 17? Yes, yes, but that was different. It's time for you to let her go. There's nothing to worry about. You better be right. ♪ Well, you wake up in the morning ♪ ♪ Hear the ding dong ring ♪ ♪ You go marching to the table See the same damn thing ♪ ♪ Let the midnight special Shine a light on me ♪ ♪ Let the midnight special ♪ ♪ Shine her ever-loving light on me ♪ I used to come to this campground every summer when I was a kid. There's a magic in the air here. Every time it rained, the raindrops would fall on others, but never on me. You know, V-Week is not just a celebration of me, India. It's celebrating all of you, too. It's a fantastic community for us, there's nothing in the world like it. Allison assures me that you're feeling very inspired here? I am. Many have spoken of me as the chosen one, India. But what if I were to tell you that I think that of you, too? That you're a chosen one as well? - Me? - Yeah. I don't know about that. But Allison says you've been an incredible mentor to her. I could be one for you, too, you know. Would you like that? Yes. I knew the moment I met you what a singular woman you were. Ready to be sculpted, molded, shaped and unearthed into greatness. I want you to understand your own physics, India. You see, women aren't as aware of their surroundings. Women are much more oblivious to certain things than men. It's true. Be obedient. Never complain. Never limit yourself to anything that has to do with your female nature. What do you mean? I mean, never use excuses like having your period to not show up for things. And always, always remember what Allison told you about lifting your hand up high, higher, high! I taught her that. Your commitment to NXIVM fills my heart with such ebullience. Your higher purpose will reveal itself soon, I can feel it. And when it does, I want to remember this moment between us, right here. That won't ever happen again, India. I promise. Unless… unless you want it to. Look into it with Allison. - What was that all about? - Nothing, really. Keith was just mentioning that he's starting a new project - and he might want me to be a part of it. - What's it about? It's a secret. Children need to become adults. That is, in our bodies, we mature, we can breathe, we can go out, we can… Do you think India's ever moving back? I miss when she was just normal. Yeah. Me, too. I'm helping friends with the documentary Venus Rising, A History of Feminism, and I think India would love to work on this with me. If she would actually call me once in a while, I could tell her all about it. I texted with her about a week ago, reminded her not to be such a stranger. She said between working at that new cafe and her coursework, there are hardly enough hours in her day. How do you like that? I don't like it, Mother, not one bit. Look at this. Business is so good. You did this. Can I get you your usual? Humanitarian adults, ecological adults, adults that… I think she's in some kind of cult. For real? I do wish you had more support. Well, I got her into this. I'm going to get her out of it. - Hey. - Hey. Sit down. I want to talk to you. What is it? I want to talk to you about our new sorority. It's kind of like a secret society for just a select few of us women, a special few. We are calling it DOS: Dominus Obsequious Sororium. What does that mean? It means Lord Master of Our Obedient Female Companions. But what it really means is a lifetime of sisterhood, a vow of dedication unlike anything we've ever known before. It's taking Jness to a whole new level, where we can tell each other our… our darkest secrets and our biggest truths. But before I tell you anything else, you have to solemnly swear an oath you will never tell another soul. I swear. There's going to be rules and rituals that no one can know about. And if you ever betray me, or us… there will be consequences. Real consequences. I could never betray you, Allison, ever. - Not after everything you've done for me. - Good. I believe you. And that is why I'm bestowing you with our highest honor. Whatever you need, I'll do it. Anything? Anything. Mark, can we talk? It's important. I'm studying right now, Bon. Can it wait? Sure. Are you ready for your transformation? Yes, Master. Yes, I am. It's time, then. Time to meet your sisters. - Hello. - Catherine, it's Bonnie. Oh, Bonnie! What a surprise. Look, I can't talk long. I shouldn't even be doing this, but I couldn't live with myself otherwise. Bonnie, what is it? What's wrong? It's India. You have to save her. You have no idea what these people are capable of. What are you talking about? Save her from what? Dominus Obsequious Sororium. Dominant over submissive. Master, please brand me. It would be an honor, an honor I want to wear for the rest of my life. Ready? One, two, three. Ready? One… …two, three. Thank you. I'm sure they'll… do everything in their power to destroy me. That's, uh… That's what they do when they feel that you've betrayed them. Bonnie, what kind of danger is my daughter in? India is a member of a secret slave-master group called DOS. India is Allison's slave. Allison is her master. Each master has to recruit more slaves and then eventually, over time, the slaves become the masters themselves. Slaves. Masters. What the hell are you talking about? India signed a vow of obedience and gave damaging collateral about herself. Keith has them on starvation diets, , makes them take nude photos. They have to sign away their… possessions, their property, their bank accounts. India would never be involved in something as twisted as this. Catherine. Allison has brainwashed her, manipulated her, all for Keith's benefit. India is a very smart girl, but she's also vulnerable. Too impressionable. To help her, you have to learn everything you can. You have no idea how much Keith loves having control over women. He loves feeding off that power. DOS is nothing more than Allison providing their Vanguard with his own personal harem. A harem? Of sex slaves? There's something else you need to know. Part of the initiation ceremony for each member is… they're supposed to be branded. Branded? Seared into their skin, down by their genitals. What are you telling me? That my daughter has been branded like a farm animal? I wasn't there, but… that's what Allison wants for each new member. That's why I defected. They've just gone too far this time. I don't even know where to start. How do I get India out? I feel like I've lost her already. - What's this? - She was referred to me. I spoke to her myself yesterday. I've told you everything I know. Anyone can be susceptible to cults, Catherine. And I mean anyone, depending where they are in their lives, what voids they feel. I need to stage an intervention. I need to get to India immediately. It can take a long time to put together a proper intervention. I don't have a long time. Get her to laugh, share fond memories. Get her to miss home. Surround her with loved ones, but do not ambush her. This is not like addiction. No accusing her of anything. All positive light. Saying anything negative about NXIVM will only push her further away. Now she's taken out all her money, all wired to that goddamn NXIVM group. Who does this kind of shit? Not someone with a clear head. Fifty thousand dollars for tuition is one thing. But draining every last penny she had to her name is quite another. I mean, who knows what she's capable of next. I think you should sit down. The money can be replaced, but our daughter can't. Even as a youngster, he was a bright fellow. By the time he was 13, he taught himself high school math. When he graduated from Rensselaer, he had three degrees: math, biology and physics. He scored one of the three highest IQs ever recorded. His name is Keith Raniere. - His idea is called "Consumers' Buyline". - His first business was a pyramid scheme, just like NXIVM. He ripped off millions of customers. Raniere's devout followers say he is a humble genius and one of the most ethical people alive. He's a fraud, a snake oil salesman. Agent Latham, FBI. Yes, Agent Latham, this is Catherine Oxenberg. I've left you a few messages about my daughter and NXIVM. Yes, I received your messages, ma'am. We can't open an investigation based on mere speculation. No, I'm not speculating here. Do you know for a fact that this guy branded your daughter? Do you have any evidence? Any witnesses who were actually in the room that night? Are they holding her captive against her will? - No. - Then I'm sorry. I'd like to help, but you've got to give me something more to work with. Thank you. Breathe. I'm sorry I didn't listen to your instincts earlier. Oh, it's okay, Mother. You're here now. Who are you calling now? This blogger, Frank Parlato. I need to talk to him. So tell me something I'm dying to know, Ms. Oxenberg. What was Joan Collins like in real life? I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't travel all this way to reminisce about my Dynasty days. Okay. Okay, touché. What do you want to know that I haven't already written about? So you were a publicist for NXIVM. Is that right? Moons ago, took my marching orders from the almighty Vanguard and Prefect themselves, until I woke up one morning and I finally realized what a scam it all was. I mean, come on, Keith and his 240 IQ. Albert freakin' Einstein's was almost 160. Right. So you told them you'd quit and they threatened a lawsuit. Not one, missy. Hundreds. You see, that's what they do to any and all defectors and detractors. They try and destroy your reputation, litigate you to death to keep you quiet. And with all that Bronfman money behind them? It's David versus Goliath. All this deranged sex stuff you're hearing about with Keith? It's not breaking news. - What do you mean? - Well, for years, he's had 15 to 20 sexual partners at any given time. Made each of them feel like they were his one and only. His bookkeeper, Nancy's daughter, Lauren, and the Mexican girl he started to have sex with when she turned 18. Her and her sister, I heard. If he wanted you, he'd figure out a way to have you, all to himself. Rumor had it that Lauren Salzman kept that Mexican girl in her room for two whole years, so Keith could have her at his whim. And you tried exposing all this? You went to the FBI? I spoke to the same agent and he said there's not a thing we can do without more concrete evidence I'm not sure what more they need. I wrote what I believed to be true. Most of it's fallen on deaf ears. This is all unbelievable to me. You should speak to Rick Alan Ross. Maybe he can help you. I hope you have better luck than I have. Oh, yeah. They tried to silence me and sue me into oblivion, too. Fourteen years, federal court. Claimed I defamed NXIVM by posting online the psychology reports of previous defectors. But how can they sue you for that? Oh. By claiming all that stuff was proprietary. And shouldn't be allowed to be printed without their consent. Cult leaders like Keith Raniere, they… they use deception. Then, through confession, they extract secrets about you. I feel so guilty, Rick. I did this to her. I introduced her to it. Yeah, look, don't blame yourself. Destructive cults are well-oiled machines. Your daughter never stood a chance. Now, that doesn't mean that she's weak. Just brainwashed. Well, to us, perhaps, but to her? I guarantee she doesn't believe that for a second. I've been thinking about going to the press. Mmm-hmm. I have contacts at People magazine and at The New York Times, but I'm afraid to expose India like that. Listen, I've been studying Keith Raniere for years, Catherine, and, uh, he's as methodical as they come. And if you're gonna take him down, you have to be just as methodical as him. But you make one careless mistake, one slip, and he'll take you down. I know you need to protect your daughter, but you also need to match Keith Raniere at every turn. He's a dangerous man. This is India. Leave a message. Good afternoon, New York Times. How may I direct your call? ♪ Kingdom comes with a ball and chain ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Take my life, just not today ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Spill your blood, there's hell to pay ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Diggin' a six foot hole ♪ Um… I'm gonna go to the bathroom. But I'll be right back. I was thinking, in order for India to complete her assignment, I think she should take off all her clothes, pose for me in the most revealing way, at my camera. ♪ You got You got the devil inside ya ♪ ♪ You set the church on fire ♪ ♪ You got You got the devil inside ya ♪ ♪ The devil inside you ♪ ♪ You got You got the devil inside ya ♪ ♪ You set the church on fire ♪ Hey. Where did Keith go? He has a request. A special request. Just for you. No, girls, no great updates. But my flight for New York leaves in a few hours, so I'll see you both soon. I love you, my angels. We love you, too, Mom. Bye. As I've always said, the brighter the lights, the more the bugs. So, all this shows me is that we do indeed have bright lights. Sarah Edmondson is weak and confused. Does she really think that we aren't going to use her collateral against her? After all we did for her, just stabs us in the back. We need to reach out to our lawyers. Done. What about India? Her mother's causing trouble, too. Don't worry about India. She would never betray me. I'm so glad you called. You can come and stay with me, Sarah. - It's safe there. - No., No, I can't. I, uh… I'm… I'm gonna stay here a couple nights, and then… I don't know what. I… Now that they know you and I both went to The Times, um, they're gonna come after both of us. They made me feel so special for so long, Catherine. I was really struggling at that time in my life and I felt like they… truly recognized something in me. Lauren, my master… She was like a sister to me. So I thought. She made it sound like this awesome, badass bitch boot camp. I bought into all of it. I'm so sorry, Sarah. I can't even imagine. No. You don't ever want to imagine. I can show you, if you want, what they did to me. What they did to India. As soon as I realized it wasn't a symbol at all but really Keith's initials, I went ballistic. I have his initials burnt in me for the rest of my life. KR! Look! God, they're evil. Pure evil. They'll know. How was school, darlings? Got an A-minus on my world history test. Oh, that's wonderful news, Francesca! Sutton Holly asked me to the winter formal. Oh, that's wonderful, too, Rem. And what did you say? Told him I'd think about it. Let him sweat it out a bit. - Hello - Catherine. Agent Latham, FBI. I've got good news for you. We're opening a full investigation into all things NXIVM, with the full cooperation of the federal US Attorney's Office. You don't need to carry the burden of this on your shoulders alone anymore. Thank you, thank you. This is really great news. - I'll be in touch. - Thank you again. What was that all about? We are getting India back. Mom has a plan. Hi, Grandma. How are you? - Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine, dear. And you? - I'm well. I'm so glad you answered. I'm actually pretty swamped at the cafe right now. Do you mind if I call you back? No need. I just wanted to let you know I've sent you a plane ticket. I hope you haven't forgotten it's my birthday next week. Let's not dare say that number out loud. I'm here at your house, visiting, and… I just so hope you can spare 48 hours to come and see me. I miss you, dear. I miss you terribly. Um… I don't think I can. It's just a couple of days. And I've already told your mother I will not stand for any arguments. She's given me her word. Please, dear, do this for me. Okay. Two days, but I can only do two days. Lovely. Bye-bye. You really do look wonderful, darling. Everyone's excited to see you. You go ahead. I'll just be in a sec. India, please put the phone away and let's go inside. - Let me just finish this one text. - No, finish it later. It'll just take a sec. India… have you been branded? Yes, Mom, I've been branded. But why is that such a big deal? It was a good experience for me. The fact that you think that mutilating your body permanently is character-building is proof... Is proof that what, Mom? That you're brainwashed. I'm not. Don't say that. Yes, you are. I don't believe in brainwashing. Oh, angel. Don't you see that you're being manipulated by a psychopath? No, I'm not. I know exactly what's going on. I know about DOS. God, is this why you all brought me here? Darling, listen to me. We can talk about this. There's a specialist. I think you'll like her. Please take this. I know about the collateral that they made you give. And if you gave them anything about me and that's keeping you there, I need you to know that I don't care about that at all. I would never. You have no idea what you're talking about. You're in a cult, a sex cult. We are not a cult! We are a family, a sorority. You don't understand and you never will. - Those people don't care about you! - Yes, they do! Listen, listen to me, India. Please, please. The FBI are closing in on NXIVM. Please leave now, before there's nothing that I can do to help you. - I'm so on the next plane out of here. - India, please! Wait! India! India? What? What happened? What did you say to her? Oh, my God, Mother, what have I done? I screwed it all up. Your crusade now, Catherine, is one of a desperate mother trying to bring her child home. It's something all mothers, all parents can absolutely relate to. It is, Steffi, and thank you for having me on. It must be unbearable. Because India has been hijacked… yes. I fear that her life is in danger, or else I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing. There are defenders of NXIVM who say these women are all adults, and anything they do is consensual. Well, let me start by saying that extortion is not consent. Coercion is not consent. What is rather remarkable about this case is that these are women doing these awful things to other women. I cannot let my daughter live like this. But I don't know what else to do to get her out. If I can't save my daughter from NXIVM, I'll still do everything I know how to help save the other women, the other victims. I know that I'm in the fight of my life. But never underestimate the power of a mother's love. I cannot let my daughter live like this, but I don't... Your goddamned mother is causing us a lot of trouble. You need to post something on Facebook. - Post what? - I don't know. - Think of something. - Okay. Sit down. More collateral? Why? You need to tell me her deepest, darkest secret. I can't think of anything. The most humiliating thing. I can't! An affair? A drug addiction? - An eating disorder? - God, Allison, stop! I don't want to do this. I don't think you appreciate the severity of this situation. So we'll sue. For millions. Let's drag her name through the mud, like we've done to the others. India is one of us now. Her mother's not going to jeopardize her life. This… this princess is not going to destroy everything I've built over the last 20 years. We built, Vanguard. We! Yes, yes, Prefect. We. We, all of us, have dealt with these irritations in the past, so what makes this so different? The media is all over us. Catherine Oxenberg has become a major pain in the ass. She has gone to law enforcement. She has gone to the U.S. Attorney's Office. We have members defecting by the dozens. We have never been under so much scrutiny before. Shh. Yes, we have, we have. It's always made us stronger. This, too… will make us stronger. Catherine. You want a bulletproof case, here it is. Falsified financial statements, years of NXIVM tax returns, and testimonials from dozens and dozens of defectors and victims' families. It's clear evidence of racketeering and sex trafficking. Well, thank you for your persistence. We're gonna have to talk to your daughter. Whenever it happens, please make sure to keep India safe. You have my word. Take care of him, Lauren. He doesn't understand how bad the publicity has gotten. Mom, I won't let anything happen to him, I promise. What's happening? Where are you going? Mexico. Lauren chartered a plane. We're taking Keith away, somewhere safe. You're leaving me? Once we're settled, you can come and join us. But in the meantime, if anybody comes around asking any questions… police, reporters, do not talk to anyone. - Do you understand me? - No, I don't understand. I don't understand any of this anymore. Everything is going to be fine. Nancy Salzman. How can I help you? Who is it? Open the door. Go inside! Open the door! You can't just barge in here! Where's your warrant? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Get your hands up, amigo, as high as they can go, higher, higher! Keith! Where are you taking him? - You can't do this. - Keith! Where are you taking him? Here we go. India Oxenberg? Dennis Latham, FBI. We need you to come with us. Am I in trouble? Sex cult leader, Keith Raniere, and his first lieutenant, actress Allison Mack, are being arraigned here today, at federal court, in Brooklyn. Both are facing charges of sex trafficking, forced labor, extortion and racketeering. If Raniere is convicted on all charges, he could face a lifetime behind bars. Mr. Raniere has not broken any laws. It is still the United States of America, and adults can engage in sexual relationships that they consent to. Allison Mack is alleged to have played a key role in recruiting women to be Raniere's sex slaves as part of a secret sorority called DOS. Allison, is there anything you want to say to the people you hurt? Keith Raniere and Allison Mack lack any hint of a moral compass. They will justify any abuse, and they need to be held accountable for each and every single woman that they have harmed and exploited, physically and mentally, including my daughter. It's an $11 billion industry that is completely unregulated. Will India be charged with any crimes? It doesn't look like it, thank God. They realize she was a victim of all of this. How is your daughter doing and have you had the chance to speak to her? India is still on the inside. She's not back yet. Through it all, I believed Keith Raniere's intentions were to help people. I was wrong. I must take full responsibility… for my conduct, and that is why I am pleading guilty today. I am pleading guilty, because I am, in fact, guilty. I accept that some of the things I did was not only wrong, but criminal. I justified them by saying what we were doing was for the greater good. I was afforded a great gift by my grandfather and father. With this gift comes immense privilege and, more importantly, tremendous responsibility. I still believe that some of what we did was good. I am, and will be, a better person as a result of this. It does not come with an ability to break the law. For this, I am truly sorry. I'm very sorry for my poor decision-making that resulted in the harm to others. It never even crossed my mind that I… I would choose Keith, but then, in the end, Keith would choose Keith. There are no victims. That's why I'll choose not to be a victim. I choose not to be a victim. I choose not to be a victim. There are no ultimate victims. Therefore, I choose, I choose, I choose, I choose not to be a victim. I choose… I choose not to be a victim! Darling. - This is Melanie Dipchand. - Hi, Melanie. It's, um, India. India Oxenberg. My mom gave me your number, and, um, I think I'm ready to talk now. You look so cold. Come here. There you go. A hell has been lifted off me, nothing less. India told me that she's proud of me, and thankful for the care and diligence of the government in championing truth through to the end. She is delighted with the verdict and she is grateful for the hard work of all those involved. She and all of her friends have come through this stronger than when they entered. India did it. She figured it out. She's free. As a last resort to save my daughter, I went public with my story. I consider myself lucky to have India back safely, but my crusade led me well beyond my personal story. I have learned how many people are vulnerable to predatory abuse, which is widespread and pervasive. I want to convey how important it is for people to be educated about this far-reaching, systemic issue. My message is never give up on your child.
