No... No. No. Please. Shh, shh, shh, shh... Hey, your friend Celine is the one that recommended the restaurant. Yeah, she... I don't know what she was thinking about. I don't know what she liked about it. I honestly don't know what she ordered that could've been good. There's nothing... There's nothing good on the menu. You can't hate every restaurant that doesn't have fries. It wasn't just the fries. They didn't even give us bread. You know how important bread is to me. Do you like bread? I wasn't sure whether you liked bread after you talked about bread the whole way home. What's with all the rave about small plates? Why can't I have just one really big plate? Well, we tried. Turning 30's a big deal. I can't just take you to a buffet. Unlimited food and no waiting. What a drag. Next year, I promise. I've told you how much I love you, right? Mm. You might have mentioned it. But I still like hearing it. I'm still hungry, by the way. They do not give you enough food. One star, and that's generous. I just wanna change into PJs and make some nachos and marathon a bunch of trashy TV until we fall asleep on the couch. Surprise! Now, what if we did the exact opposite of everything you just said? This is so much better! - How're ya? - Happy birthday! I can't believe you didn't tell me! - Thanks for... - Oh... - Happy birthday, sweetheart. - Hi. So, 30. You think Catherine's gonna spring the baby question on you tonight? No babies until marriage, darling, thankfully. I don't know. She might be getting desperate. You're pretty much dried up now. I can't believe Mark's dad married her. She really does put the smother in stepmother. Okay, she's coming. - Hello, darling. Happy birthday. - Hi. - Thank you. - Oh. Oh... You remember my friend Celine. How can I forget? So, 30. Quite the milestone. You know, when I was your age, I was married with a baby. The '50s were a different time. It was so nice of you and Don to come all this way for my birthday. Well, we actually brought you a little surprise. Oh, you guys didn't have to get me anything. Well, it's actually for you andMark. Mark? Uh, I'm not sure where he's gotten to. - Ahh! - You're here. Oh, my gosh! Of course. I would absolutely not miss it. You look amazing. Nicole! Look who it is. Forgive my idiot brother. I'm... I'm Audrey. Audrey! It's so good to finally meet you. No, no. No, handshakes. You're the closest thing I've ever had to a sister. Oh, good to meet you. Okay, still lost over here. This is Mark's stepsister, Audrey. Oh, Catherine's daughter! Should've guessed. What's that supposed to mean? Um... It doesn't mean anything. I'm totally kidding. Oh! Why are we standing here? Let's go meet your friends. - Come. - After you. She is adorable. I cannot believe you. You are still using that line. It worked, didn't it? Wait, you use that line on other girls? Yeah, but you were the only one who ever fell for it. Oh! You guys are sweet, I'm... I'm glad you're a normal one because he's burnt through a lot of, uh questionable girlfriends. A lot? There weren't that many. Well, there was Maggie, Jamie, Nancy... - Lisa, Molly... - Yes. Yeah. - The girl with the piercings. - Ah, Kristen. Piercing? Where? Okay, let's try not to chase off the normal one, alright? I don't care who came before as long as no one comes after. - No one will. - Aww. And speaking of which... Let's see it? See it? Uh, the ring? Are you kidding? I... I'm sorry! I thought that mom said... - What are you talking about? - I'm... Mark? I had kind of a surprise that involved Nicole's cake, but... Nicole... I love you more than anything in the world. And even though we've only known each other a few years I feel like I've known you my whole life and I want nothing more than to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? - Mark... - Is that a yes? Yes! Yeah! Oh, I'm shaking. Yeah! Okay, so, what was meant to happen? I was gonna light the candles, then she would close her eyes and make a wish, and when she opened them, the ring would be there. It's kinda presumptuous that her, uh, wish was to marry you, right, just, like, a little presumptuous? 'Cause, like, if I was doing that... - What's all this? - Oh, hi! Morning, lovely. I thought I would make breakfast to thank you for letting me crash. Wow, I could get used to this. Do you come as part of the marriage package? I don't think Mark would want me as a third wheel. Thanks. How'd you get Mark up so early, and to do the dishes? I have my ways. She's making the Mark special. "The Mark special." Ooh, it's bliss in a burrito and a pan of cheese and bacon. Yeah, it's his favorite. Um, I used to make it every Sunday morning while our parents slept in. Wow. Talk about spoiled. You know, if you want to take up that torch once we're married... I won't object. Maybe you're better off marrying Audrey. So, I was thinking we should start planning. We've been engaged for 12 hours. I know, and I kind of already picked the venue. We make a great team. I'm sorry! I promise you'll like it, though. Timberwood? - Mm-hmm. - Sure. Let's go check it out. Audrey, you should come with us. It's beautiful. I wouldn't want to crash. No. I would love a second opinion. - Mark is pretty much a yes man. - Hey! Not all the time. Well, in that case... I would love to. Ahh. There you go. Thank you. Mm. I love you so much. - I do what I can. - I wasn't talking to you. - Okay, then I'm gonna eat it. - Why? Okay! Okay. Easy. Why, if you don't care about me, I'm... - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - I'm so close. You made this for me! You can make yourself one. I'm sorry! This place is... Wow. I know. Perfect. I can see why you love it so much here. It's not just the view. My dad took me up here a lot when I was little. Your mom not into nature? She... wasn't into being a mom. She left soon after I was born. Dad died when I was still in high school. So, I don't really have any family. Except Mark. And now you. So, when are we getting married? I can't believe they're closing this place down. I've dreamed of getting married here since I was 12. Isn't there anything we can do? Unless you want to get married in three weeks. I knew dad wasn't going to be able to walk me down the aisle but... at least here it's like... he's still with me. Like he wouldn't miss my wedding. Then do it! Get married in three weeks. You're crazy. Nicole's a teacher. She can take the summer off, right? I don't think you understand everything that goes into planning a wedding. No, Mark. What if we tried? Kept it small, called in a lot of favors. But in three weeks? Yeah. What about all the little things we want to kind of plan for? What about them? It will be here, and it will be with you. - That's all I care about. - Nicole, I... You know how much this place means to her? I mean, unless you're having doubts? No! No. Then what's the problem? I guess... There isn't one. - Really? - Let's do it. Okay, if we're going to do this we have to make some serious cuts. Cap it at 50? Sounds good. Audrey, you don't have to do that. Oh, nonsense. I can earn my keep. I only need to invite four people. Mm, that's sweet... and sad. Okay. Uncle Oliver and his wife. Would you say that you're wedding invite-close? I guess. You guess? What makes someone wedding invite-close? - Babe... - I don't know. Whatever you think. Come on. This is your family. I need some real feedback here. Definitely invite them. - Really? - Oh, yeah, invite them. But don't work too hard in trying to find a seat for them. They haven't gone to a wedding in ten years, but they always send a check. Done. Thank you. I appreciate that. May I? Be my guest. Um, just had a baby. Not worth the drama. Hasn't spoken to Mark since high school. - Cousin Steve? - Cousin Steve. How do you feel about dogs at your wedding? I'd say I'm against it. So, bye-bye, Margaret. Audrey, what are you doing for the summer? Ugh, I'm staying at mom and Don's, but only until I die of boredom. Uh, how'd you feel about... staying with us? - You want me to stay? - Only if you want to. It's just I've got three weeks to plan this whole wedding, and I could really use your help. I don't... I don't know. - Mark? - Sure. It'll be just like back home, but this time with satellite TV. And we could get to know each other better before we officially become sisters. Okay. I would love to. Great! You can stay in the guest bedroom, and we'll feed you. Hm! Look at us. Not even married, and we already have a freeloading daughter. Ignore him. Back to this. I like how ruthless you are. I can't believe you kept this hidden from me this whole time. I wasn't hiding it. How did you find it anyway? Oh, please, you've been hiding things in your sock drawer since ninth grade. I found some very interesting things over the years. Hmm. Do tell. Do not! Ah, jackpot. Okay, this is my favorite thing. Look at those chubby chipmunk cheeks. This is nice. We should make fun of me more often. And who is the trollop that drew the heart? As your fiancee, I am now privileged this information. Uh, let's see. Senior year, that would be... Becca Gould. She was one of the... questionable ones. I'm guessing there was a falling out? Yeah, things didn't end well. This was very mature, by the way. That was actually my handiwork. She went to second base with this guy, and I confronted her on it, and, uh, she punched me in the face. - Seriously? - Yeah. Audrey came home with a black eye and wouldn't tell us why. I had to wait till our parents went to bed, and then I made her tell me. - Next day... - Bye-bye, Becca. Guess I'll be on my best behavior while you're in town. You should be. I'll be watching. Um, okay, I know we've been going at it all day, but we should probably talk some more wedding. That sounds like a job for you two. Oh, please, you have more experience planning weddings than we do. What? - Audrey... - Well, Rachel! Uh, Mark's last fiancee. Last fiancee? I, I thought you would've... Nicole, I... I'm so sorry. I thought you told her. Oops. - Baby... - Rachel? - Your last fiancee? - I'm sorry. When were you going to tell me about this? Were you just going to casually mention it at the altar? I know I shouldn't have kept this from you. I've just been waiting for the right time to talk about it. I feel like such an idiot. I'm planning our wedding, and I didn't even know that you were engaged before? Okay. Okay. Before I met you, Rachel was the first real relationship I had. We were happy. At least, I thought we were. The day of our wedding... They found her at the bottom of a bridge. She jumped. In her dress. All she left was a note that said, "I'm sorry." No warning... no explanation. And until I met you... I never thought I'd be able to care for somebody like that again. It was just... too painful. - Mark... - I know... I should've told you sooner, and I promise I was going to. But part of me just... closed off. Baby, I'm sorry, I should've... But... I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything. If we're going to do this, we can't have any secrets. Is there anything else that you need to tell me? No. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sure. Hey. Hey! I am sorry about before. Wine tends to open me up. No. Actually, I'm glad I found out about it now. It's just... so sad. It was really hard for us, but I think it really, really devastated Mark. I mean, I would practically have to drag him out of bed every morning. I was... the only person he would talk to. He told me that he wouldn't have gotten through it without you. That you were there for the whole thing. We had a long talk. Actually, it's funny, I think it brought us closer together. Great. I'd hate to think that I got in between you two. No! No, of course not. So, what's on the agenda? I actually have to get going. I'm meeting Celine for some retail therapy, dress shopping. Great. I will get my purse. Oh, okay. Hi! Oh! I can't believe this is happening! Three weeks? You're a crazy person. I know. I, um, see you brought another crazy person. I didn't really have a choice. She kind of just invited herself. Well, sure. She ruined your engagement. Why not ruin this, too? Celine. Future mother-in-law. I'd better take that. You didn't tell her about today, did you? Of course not. Try to play nice, okay? Catherine? Hi! Good to see you! I kinda thought it was going to be me and Nicole today. Yeah, I hope you don't mind me tagging along. I wanted to make sure she chose something tasteful. Excuse me? Look who I found in the parking lot. Surprise! I didn't want you to choose a dress without the mother of the bride. I'm so sorry I'm late. It would've been great to have had some advance notice, but... No, you're, uh, you're right on time. Alright. Shall we? Now the first few you tried on were a little more extravagant, but I think you'll find this one elegant in its simplicity. So? What do you think? - It's perfect. - It really is. It's definitely unique. You don't usually see a wedding dress that basic. Personally, I like the first one. She looked like a tent covered in glitter. Well, I think Mark would really like it. Mark does love camping. So? I think this is it. - I think this is the one. - Wonderful. Now, we are not blessed with a lot of time, so I have to get to the alterations right away. I am so happy for you two. Now, I just know Mark is going to fall in love with you all over again when he sees you in that dress. Thanks, Catherine. I'm so glad that you could come. I left my phone in the dressing room. I will... be right back. - Find what you were looking for? - Yes, I found my phone. Great. Okay. Okay, we'll put a priority on this, so expect a call in about a week for the fitting. Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. - Oh, it's our pleasure. - Ready? Yeah. Wait a moment. Your purse. Oh! Yes. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Have a good day. You, too. I'm so glad that you came here. Okay, but Don is expecting us. Would you mind terribly if I stole Audrey away for a family lunch? - No, of course not. - Yeah, family comes first. Can we do the lunch some other time? We have a photo-shoot. Honey, we're leaving tomorrow. You're not gonna come with us, we need to figure something out. - Fine. - I'll save you some cake. Yeah, I'll see you another time. So, I think I saw a flower shop over on 2nd. It should be on the way. Are you sure you want flowers? I know how you like to keep things basic. Okay, let's retract the claws. I'm just saying Audrey's kind of a giant bitch. What are you talking about? She's like the nicest person I know. I'm not saying she's the Antichrist, but she's creepy. No, she's not. You were fine with her just inviting Catherine without asking? She likes the element of surprise. Most predators do.

Oh, no! Looks like the box is empty. Celine, I'm serious! Oh, hey! You came just in time to see pictures. Hey, thank you for saving me a piece. It's so good. Of course. Nice dress. Oh, it's yours. Um, I hope you don't mind. I didn't do the laundry. No. Um, you're family. My closet's your closet. Come help me pick a photo for the invite. Of course! Celine? That is so beautiful. That's it.

You made a sex tape? Celine's brilliant idea. Oh, come on. Tell me that Mark didn't love it. And you will, too, when you're 80 and gross and wrinkled. Anyway, back to this. What do you think, Audrey? - Exactly what I would want. - Decision made! This calls for a celebration drink. Shall we? Not yet. We still have to address all those envelopes. Well, actually I did them when you were at the photo shoot this afternoon. Here you go. Wow, Audrey! Look. You can't even tell that I didn't even write these. So I copied your handwriting, so it looks more authentic. By the 20th, I couldn't even tell the difference. Where did you get her handwriting? From the invitation list. Uh, I hope you don't mind. No! Nicole and I were going to do these. Now you don't have to. Audrey, I don't know what to say. Thank you! Of course! Now I'm definitely ready for that drink. So, I know things have moved kind of quickly since you got here, but I just wanted to say that we're so happy to have you. I'm happy, too. I love it here. We wouldn't have been able to pull this off without you, and Mark and I were talking, and... We'd be honored if you would be my bridesmaid. A-are you sure? Of course, I want you up on that altar with me on the happiest day of my life. I would love to. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I think the puffball is winning. But I was about to turn the tables. Fluffy here is lucky you came along. Thanks so much for doing this. I know bridal showers aren't really your thing. Well, we can't all be cloned from Martha Stewart's evil twin. So, we have something for you. Um... Here. We were going to give it to you at the wedding, but... now just felt right. It's beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for being my maid of honor. You're an amazing friend, and... an okay decorator. It looks like Pinterest puked all over your backyard. And don't forget all the cringe-worthy games and activities we've yet to experience. - There will be cringing. - So much cringing. Could I get everyone's attention, please? Ladies, please help me welcome a very special guest, as we play the newlywed game! Alright! You owe me. Okay, this game consists of ten questions. Mark will have to prove he knows his betrothed's deepest, darkest secrets, and for every question wrong he will remove an article of clothing. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. Well, it was worth a shot. Okay, Mark. Are you ready? - Let's do this! - Okay, question one. What is Nicole's favorite flavor of ice cream? While, she might tell casual acquaintances it's cookie dough, the awful truth is that her favorite is rum raisin. - Oh... - Correct! It's a legitimate flavor. It's gross, honey. You need to learn to accept that. Question two. What is Nicole's biggest fear? Uh... I'm gonna go with her irrational fear of birds. - Correct! - It is not irrational. - They will peck you! - Silence! Yeah! Okay. Question three. What is Nicole's most embarrassing photo? This one's easy. Seventh grade, bowl cut in overalls. She thought she destroyed every copy, but... You didn't! Show me bowl cut in overalls! Um, that's not... I, uh, I didn't... Nicole... I can't believe she would do that. Nicole... I work with those people. I-I-I teach their kids. This is so humiliating. What were you thinking? I'm sorry. I don't know what happened. No, don't do that. You don't get to pull a stunt like that and then play dumb. I promise, I didn't. I would never... Yes, you would! You always do. You always have to be the center of attention, and you push it too far! You humiliated me! I swear I don't know what happened. Just go. You... Audrey! Is it me you hate or just Nicole? I know you're upset that your little joke backfired. You can drop the act. I see who you are. And I'm going to make sure everyone else sees it, too. Celine, are you feeling okay? Because if stress of being maid of honor is getting to you, I can take over some of your responsibilities. You stay away from my responsibilities, and you stay the hell away from Nicole. - Hi. - Hey. She must be so heartbroken. Can you do me a favor? Of course. Can you talk to her? I'm sort of at a loss here. Absolutely. I know how to handle this. It will be okay. Hi. Look, it's okay to be upset. You have a wedding and a stepsister in town, and a maid of honor who kind of stabbed you in the back. It's hard not to think everything going wrong is some kind of sign, like... maybe we're rushing into things. Do you believe in signs? I don't know. Maybe. I mean, sometimes it's hard to ignore. - I should talk to her. - No. You know what? You shouldn't be guilted into anything. She messed up, right? I mean, it should be you to call her back when you're ready. You don't wanna say something that you regret, right? Yeah. You're right. Thanks, Audrey. I'm really glad you're here. I'm gonna get a refill. Want a cup? Uh, no. Caffeine makes me a little crazy. Hey, it's Celine. I know you're pissed at me, but we need to talk. It's about Audrey. I looked up a few of Mark's ex-girlfriends. Nicole, she's... I think she's dangerous. I'm working late tonight, but please call me back. Hey. - Everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I was just checking the time. Big plans tonight? I think something just came up. Nicole, I know you're avoiding me, but, uh... I have to talk to you. I'm coming over. It's gonna be okay. She's still hanging on. We can't give up on her, right? Okay. This is my fault. No. No. No, it's not. She just... She must have fallen. Hey. You can't blame yourself. I should've just answered her phone call. Nicole, look at me. Look at me. This is not your fault. Bad things happen. But this isn't something you're going through alone. For the rest of our lives, whatever horrible things life throws at us, we'll face them together. ♪ I hope we can be much more than friends ♪ ♪ So bon appetit je t'aime ♪ Bon appetit ♪ Audrey. Hey! I didn't hear you come in. - What is all this? - Oh, it's nothing. I just thought that after your visit you might want to come home to a hot meal. I've also cleaned up a bit, if you don't mind, and there's a hot bath ready, in case you want to relax before dinner, so take a seat. Take a seat. You shouldn't have done this. Oh, it's the least I can do! That's not what she meant. Nicole has a wedding to plan. The last thing she needs to worry about is the laundry. You've been cooped up so much lately, it must be nice to get out for the night, huh? There you go. Did I do something wrong? No, it's fine. It's just Celine is... How is Celine? Comatose. The doctors say she's hanging in there, but she hasn't woken up yet. So awful. Do they know what happened? Either she somehow tripped and fell, or... - Or? - Or someone pushed her. Oh, no... the chicken. Ah-ah ah-ah ahh! Disaster averted... I hope. Dinner is almost ready. Poor thing. Well, looks like it's just the two of us. I'm gonna make sure she's alright. Oh, uh... She probably needs some space, Mark. I mean, I went to all this trouble. I mean, just... stay and eat with me. I'm sorry. Just... Sorry. Like, this is right there and I think that that's probably why you... - Hey. It's perfectly normal! Morning. How was the run? It was good. You're right, I feel better. I guess that's why they call it exorcising your demons. You're such a dork. Like, the biggest dork. Audrey, I thought you were going shopping. Yeah, I'm gonna wait for you, so we can go together. I'm going to have a shower. Actually, Audrey and I were talking. The wedding's less than a week away. And now you probably need more help than ever... with Celine... So if you want, I would like you... to consider me... your maid of honor. - What? - Perfect, right? She can help get things back on track. I'm already following up on Celine's responsibilities. The venue coordinator is up to speed on everything. I just need a few details from you regarding the bachelorette party, which I think... There isn't gonna be a bachelorette party. My best friend's in the hospital. Nicole, listen. I don't wanna talk about replacing my maid of honor. The position is still filled. I'm not saying Celine didn't make a good maid of honor. - She did a fine job. - Do not... refer to her in the past tense. - She's still alive. - She didn't mean anything by it. No, she never does. Can we not do this right now in front of Audrey? Then when, Mark? She's always here. I'm so sorry. What was that all about? Which part? The part where you were talking like Celine's already dead, or the part where we haven't had 30 seconds to ourselves in two weeks because your sister's always here? Audrey's crying out there. Mark, I'm going to be your wife. Could you try defending me, for once? Um... Sorry. I feel like I'm losing my mind. My best friend's in critical condition. The universe is conspiring against our wedding. We're fighting over stupid details. We get married in four days. I don't know how to deal with all this. Together. Yeah. Together. Uh, I'm sorry. I'm... sorry. I just... I feel like I'm constantly waiting for the next thing to go wrong. I guess sooner or later, we all turn into bridezillas. Well, if you had to stomp on anyone, aim for the coordinator. She was kind of mean to me on the phone. You probably deserved it. It's possible. Um, I should go talk to Audrey. It can wait. Stay here for a while. So, this is the one that I was talking about, where, like, the hair goes up but it's also down. - It looks... - No, I like that. - I love that dress, too. - Speaking of dresses... - We should go. - Yes. - Yeah. - I will be ready in one second. Okay. Looks like you patched things up. Yes. We spent the whole day at the mall yesterday. She's been really sweet about it. I still can't believe I snapped at her like that. Thank you. It means a lot to me that you two get along. Just promise me we won't bring her along for the honeymoon. - Deal. - Okay. It's David. Probably lost his invite. Hey, David. Lose your invite? I'll... Wait, what? - He's in town. - Already? No, man... We aren't havin' a bachelor party. We... They did? No, I guess... Yeah, that's great. I'll see you tonight. Later. Bachelor party? I thought we were canceling. Didn't you tell them? I... think this is my fault. Uh, I didn't know that you didn't want a bachelor party, so I called everyone, and... I'm so sorry. I wanted to surprise you. It, it's just because Celine's still in the hospital, so... They all flew in, Nicole. I can't just not show. - I'm so... - Sorry, I know. Okay, um, just... Try not to be too late, okay? And maybe don't get super drunk 'cause we have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow for the wedding, and... We'll make it an early night. - And Mark... - I know. No strippers. Nothing crazy, I promise. Trust me. Audrey, can you come in for a sec? This isn't... - Of course. - The zipper must be stuck or... - Yeah. - Could you... Yeah. Yeah. Hold still. This is so weird. Are you sure this didn't happen before? Yes, yes. It wasn't this tight. - Nothing was this tight. - Okay, we will fix this. Uh, dress lady? You know, a lot of brides gain weight before the wedding, so it's totally normal. - I didn't gain weight. - Okay. Okay. Coming in! How's it going in here? Oh. That's all wrong. Wh-what's wrong? It's... It was taken in far too much. Unless you happened to gain a little weight, or... - No. - I don't know what went wrong. - Who took these measurements? - You did. You took the measurements. What did you do? - Audrey... - No! It's your-It's your perfect dress, and you completely screwed it up! Well, we'll definitely take the measurements again and see what we can do. How much time do we have? Three days. Oh, no. I'm sorry. That is impossible. What do you mean, impossible? W-what does that mean? Maybe we can try on some of the other ones you liked, to see if they're a closer fit. This is my dress. This... Sweetie, I am so sorry. Let me go up front and see what we got in today. Hey. We will find you a bigger dress. It's not just the dress. This is supposed to be the most important day of our lives, and nothing has gone right. Maybe we shouldn't be getting married right now. Maybe we just rushed into it. Is there anything... I can do? No. No. Thank you. Just wanna think. Okay. Hey. Hey. Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you had your bachelor party. Charlie's on his way to pick me up. Is Nicole here? I wanted to talk to her before I left. Yeah. She wanted some time alone. She has a lot on her mind. Everything alright? Mm. Come on. Talk to me. It's just, um... Something Nicole said. I hope you don't plan on taking advantage of me. Welcome back. And... maybe it's just stress. It's just, she doesn't seem like herself lately. Things have been a bit tense. Mm-hmm. What did she say? I don't know, Mark, it's... not my, you know... Audrey, what? She said that, with everything going wrong, that maybe you guys got in over your head, and maybe you should slow down. Slow down? She said she wanted to postpone the wedding. She said that? Mm-hmm. I'm so happy you're alright. How are you feeling? I've been better. The pain meds aren't too bad, though. Nicole, I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be walking down an aisle any time soon. You have nothing to be sorry about. Besides, I don't think there's going to be a wedding. What? I think we just rushed into things. You know, I... I thought I could handle it, but... everything is falling apart. Things have been so tense between Mark and me. Maybe it's not meant to be right now. Nicole, you can't honestly think that all of this is your fault, that everything that's happened is some sort of coincidence. What do you mean? I found some things out about Audrey. She's dangerous. She wants to stop the wedding? And look, that's why I didn't want to say anything, because she's overwhelmed, and so are you. I mean, planning a wedding in three weeks can send any relationship off the rails, Mark. I know we've been a little bit out of sync, but I didn't think it was anything this serious. You should talk to her. Maybe you should call off the wedding. I mean, just for now. With everything that happened with Rachel, you... You know you don't want to rush into things. Mark. Mark. Mark. Whatever happens... I am here. Marky Mark! It's party time! Yeah. Just, uh, give me a second. What's up with him? - He and Nicole are fighting. - Seriously? Your brother has the worst luck with women. So, where is the party tonight? My place. We're just hanging out. Can I crash? Uh... I was totally kidding. Come with me. Uh, Mark's probably gonna try and be a downer and come home early, so do me a favor. Buy a few bottles of the good stuff, on me, and make sure... he has... a good time. I'll make sure. He's a lucky guy to have you in his life. Oh. Sweet. You ready? Let's do this. Come on. I can't stay out too late. Can you try to have a good time? - That I can promise. - Okay. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me. He loves me. He loves me. Hello? Mark? Audrey? You remember that girlfriend that you talked about, Becca Gould? I talked to her. You talked to her? - Celine... - Audrey is lying. Becca never cheated on Mark. And she never hit Audrey. She thinks that Audrey hurt herself. Why would she do that? That's crazy. I know. It's not the first time it happened. She pointed me to a lot of girlfriends that Mark has dated, and they all said the same thing. How wonderful Mark is... and how possessive his stepsister is. Celine, you had a really big fall... and you're on a lot of drugs. Nicole... I didn't fall. I was pushed. ♪ Nobody's looking for favor this one's just for me... ♪ - Hey, baby! - Whoa! What... Charlie called this? Dude, who did it? No, no, no... Let's get this party started, baby! ♪ Wrap my legs around you ♪ And you feel me holding you tight ♪ ♪ Lost inside my heavy breath ♪ I dare you to speak of her Oh, yeah. ♪ Prisoners in my heart ♪ Just one glance in the devil's eyes ♪ ♪ I dare you to speak of her ♪ Oh, wow. Whoo! Hey. Hi, baby. - Sorry I was so late, I, uh... - We need to talk. Is it about the wedding? - Audrey told me you... - No, I... Wait, what did Audrey tell you? She said you told her you were having second thoughts. - Is that true? - No! I mean... Yes, I did tell her that, but... So you can talk to my sister but not to me? I'm trying to talk to you about your sister. Celine's awake. She told me she learned some stuff about Audrey. At first I didn't know whether or not to believe... Why is Celine investigating Audrey? Because she knew something wasn't normal. And, and she was right. I found this. So you're investigating my sister, too? Wait. You knew about this? She's had some problems, Nicole. It doesn't mean you can invade her privacy. Invade her privacy? She's staying in our home. I thought we said no more secrets? This isn't my secret to tell! Uh, I'm gonna leave you two... No, you'll get out of my house. - What? - Audrey, don't go anywhere! If you have a problem with my sister, you can leave. But it's fine. Mark, can you take me to a hotel? No. Mark can't drive. Mark's had too much to drink. I'll call you a cab. Just, just stay here, okay? It's fine. I'll handle this. It's fine. - You had a stripper tonight? - What? After you looked me in the eyes and said, "Trust me?" - How did you... - It doesn't matter how. I didn't ask for her. She just showed up. Strippers don't just appear, Mark. They get hired. I told them no. Charlie must have hired her. Did Charlie put her on your lap, too? - Nicole, I think... - I don't care what you think. Get out of my house! Audrey, don't... - What is wrong with you? - Nothing is wrong with me! Something is wrong with your sister. Mark, listen. Have we ever fought like this? Ever? Not until she showed up. When you found this, was it empty? They all were. Damn it. She's off her meds. Audrey is sick, Nicole. Okay? She's not crazy. She's not evil. - She's my sister and she's sick. - Mark... But if you think she's trying to sabotage me or my chance at happiness... you're sick, too. I think you're right. Maybe we should call off the wedding. Audrey, it's Nicole. I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry. Please come home. Mark, I know you're angry, okay, but you've got to come home. It's Audrey. I... Mark? You're trying to take him away from me? Audrey, please. Everyone always tries to take him away, but you can't. We're meant to be together. It's fate. You have to embrace your fate, Nicole! Audrey, what are you doing? She's trying to take you away, Mark. She's trying to keep us apart! Audrey, listen to me. Put the knife down. Let me help you. Help? No, no, no. I'm not going back to the hospital, no. - No, I'm not going back there. - It's just... I belong here with you, Mark! - Audrey... - Can't you see what she's doing? Everything was fine. Hmm? Until you decided to marry her. I got better for you. - I'm fine. I'm fine! - Okay, that's, that's enough. That's enough. That's enough. You're choosing her over your own sister. I'm not going back there. No, I'm not going back. You can't make me go back. - Let's talk about this. - No. I'm going to die. - No! No! - Mark... Audrey, let us help you. - Audrey. Audrey. - Please don't make me go back. Audrey, I love you. I would never hurt you. You know that, don't you? You love me? Yes. Please, let me help you. I love you. Please, never leave me. - Do you promise? - I promise. - Please. - I promise. - Please. - I promise. Please don't leave me. How is she? My parents are taking her back to the hospital. They'll stay with her until she's stable. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kept this from you. I understand if you don't want to go through with the wedding. Call it off? After everything you've seen in the past two weeks? I've seen some terrible things. But I also saw the way you handled Audrey... and how much you love her... how much you love me. Mark, if we can get through this, anything else life throws at us will be easy. Are you sure you want this? I'm sure. Also, the deposit on the honeymoon is non-refundable. So... - Hey. - Hey, are you there? I'm just arriving now. - Is it everything you hoped for? - It's perfect. Actually, no, it's not. I wish you were here. It's not going to be the same. Yeah, you're right. You should cancel. The way things have gone, if I don't get married today, I don't think I'll get another chance. Fair enough. How's the dress? Not what I wanted, but... it'll do. You should write that on the cake. Okay, well, um... You have some marrying to do, and I have physical therapy, so, um... You're still coming to visit before the reception, right? Of course. You'd better, and, Nicole... Congratulations. I love you. Love you, too. Wonderful to see you again, Miss Cavanaugh. Care to follow me to the bridal suite? Lead the way. Okay, everything is all set and running smoothly. All you need to do is get ready. Where were you last week? Have a vanity here, bathtub, bathroom through there. I'll give you some space, but if you need anything, just holler, I'm right nearby. Thank you. Nicole... Hello? - Hello, bride. - Hi. - You okay? - Yeah! Sorry. Just... nerves. I've got just the thing for that. Wow, bottom shelf. I'm swooning. You should be. That's what we drank on our first date. - Mark! - So. How about a quick toast before becoming my legal property? Mm, you're so funny, but no. I'm in my dress. - You can't be in here. Now go! - Uh, okay. Okay, okay. Just... I came here because I had to see you. And tell you... after everything we've been through, I've never been more sure. I can't wait to marry you. And we are going to be... so happy. Then you better let me finish getting ready. See you at the altar. I don't think the blood is gonna come out of your dress. I suppose it doesn't matter. Hmm? Since you left Mark at the altar. First Rachel, then Nicole. You, uh, couldn't stand the pain, so you overdosed, right here in your room. Don't worry. You left a note. Recognize the handwriting? You said yourself I was pretty good at it. Nicole? Five-minute warning. Everything okay in there? Be right out! Okay! We'd better go. Wedding's about to start. ♪ It's my day ♪ ♪ It's my town ♪ Walking down ♪ Where he was ♪ ...forever till your last breath ♪ ♪ I'll always love you ♪ To death Audrey? Yes, my darling. I'm here. What the hell is going on? Where is Nicole? I am so sorry. She's gone. What are you talking about? She left you this. She left you, Mark. Everyone leaves you. Except for me. What did you do? It's so beautiful. It's so perfect. Everyone's here for us. Everything will be perfect if you just say, "I do." Nicole! Mark? Mark? Oh, sh... Nicole. Nicole. ♪ ...You to death Mark! What did you do? She's gone, Mark. We can still have our wedding. They're all still waiting for us. You're my sister! Who are you calling, Mark? I need an ambulance. My fiancee, she's not breathing. Stop it! I know you love me, just like I love you. Don't make me do something we'll both regret. - Audrey, you were getting help. - I know you love me, Mark. We danced together... at the bachelor party. We never danced at the bach... The stripper. That was you? Oh, didn't that feel so good? Didn't that feel right, Mark? Let me take care of you. Get away from me! You're crazy! She doesn't care about you! You're out of your mind! She doesn't care about you, Mark! Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mark. I can help you down the aisle. It's gonna be okay.

Yeah, Dr. Lucado says I'm making real progress. And part of the treatment plan is, um, making amends for those that I've... hurt, and I just want to say, um... I'm really sorry. I didn't realize what I was doing. Audrey, we know. We forgive you. I don't know how you can forgive me after what I've done. That wasn't you, Audrey. We know that. I don't know how to thank you for forgiving me. You just work on getting better. That's all we want. Do you have it? Are you sure? Yeah. No, I need to see it to, um... remind myself of what's real. After everything, we decided to keep it simple. It's so beautiful. I think our time's up. Thank you for coming. I know it can't have been easy. We'll always be here for you, Audrey. You're our sister. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me.
