My name is Mattei. I'm overseeing the biggest armed robbery case of my career. And you're suspected of being the sniper who took potshots at my men while your accomplices fled. We found no identification, no documents in your home. Nothing to identify you. Even your weapon can't be found. No one knows you. You don't exist. And that's... my proof that you're my man. THE LOOKOUT TWO DAYS EARLIER Nicolas Ricci, Italian, 35, numerous armed robbery convictions. We've tailed him for 3 weeks. This morning he contacted 3 men, as yet unidentified. My intuition tells me, at exactly 10 AM, they're hitting a bank. Their 15th in 2 years. On my signal, we'll have 5 minutes to lock up the area. And civilians? They're in no danger? In 2 years, these guys haven't run into a cop or fired a single shot. - They won't do anything dumb. - How do you know? You've never put them to the test. Why not tail them and grab them later? Because that's not what I decided, Captain Meyer. So get ready! And put on your bulletproof vests. I'm here to help, Chief Mattei. Just take orders! Good morning, National Police. Move inside, please. Bring your customers in, right now! National Police. We're locking down the neighborhood. Everything's in place. We're waiting for them to come out. Olivier. Look! Wait for my orders! We're waiting! Police! Move! What the fuck is this? Police! Don't move! What is this shit? Toss your gun! Get out! Get out of the car! It's over! Turn yourself in! Calm down! Get out of here! Take cover! Sniper! - Take cover! - Sniper! Get down! Stop! The cops! Turn left! Block them! Bust through! Ryan! Get him out! Eric! Shit! Take cover! Shoot again and you're dead! I can't take it! Breathe! We'll pick up Vincent! On your knees. Don't move. Give me your gun. Hurry! Nico's croaking! What the fuck happened, Vincent? Why were all those cops there? Calm down! We lost them! You Okay? - I'm gonna croak. - No, you're not! We'll go to the doctor. All our contacts are toast. He's right. - I know somebody. - Who? A doctor. Outside of town. We'll change cars and go. Come on, let's go. We're at the doctor's, Nico. A neighborhood cop. One bullet's gone from his gun. He wounded a robber and got iced. He's losing lots of blood. Good thing you came. They hit a superficial artery. Fortunately, far from any vital organs. You ever practiced? Legally. Yeah, for a while. Why'd you stop? What do you care? He's my friend. I won't hand him over to a butcher. I don't give a damn what you think. If I don't operate, he'll croak. So shall I stop? Wanna shop around? So either shut up or take off. What could I do? The asshole started shooting! I had to take him out! So? So we wait. Wait for fucking what? 2 or 3 weeks to hit another? With all those cops on our ass? You fuckin' piss me off! Sit down. Let's see what happens. Somebody snitched. Nobody snitched. The cops just did their job. I'm Chief Mattei. Where is he? Where's your husband hiding? He's hiding? What for? Know what that is? A cartridge. It's missing one bullet. Nico took it. In the stomach. If he's not treated fast, it's over. I don't know anything. Know what I think? You know everything. Think of him. If we don't find him now, he'll die out there. And you won't even know. Is that what you want? He never tells me anything. Never. My dough? Vincent'll pay you. Don't bullshit me! The money you owe me! Did you pull the heist? The bread's not mine yet. When are you splitting it up? Who knows? When Vincent says. What Vincent? Vincent who? We've got millions in the trunk! And you're busting my balls for 10 or 20 thousand? What about this? Did you show Vincent this? Does he know? When your head's splitting and you're crawling on the floor, whining, is he the one you call? Is it him or me? You've only got one friend. Me. I removed the bullet and sewed him up but... he needs to be watched closely. There could be complications. He should stay here for at least 24 hours. We can't stay or come back. I'll stay with him. Until he can be moved. And then? Bring him to a safe place. With friends. How long before he's better? A good 2 months. I'll fix you something to eat. Thanks. We split it up in 2 months. In the usual place. That's too long, Vincent. Nothing happens without Nico. I'll hide the dough in a safe place. Police emergency. The marksman you're looking for is at 33 rue des Archives. Police! You're not a typical bank robber. How many marksmen like you are there in the world? 200? 300? It doesn't matter. It'll take as long as it takes. But I'll send your picture to every outpost in France. Every intelligence office in the world. I'll find out who you are. Which will lead me to your accomplices. Catherine Beaumont. She's my lawyer. How'd you know I moved to Paris? You've got a nerve. After disappearing for 2 years. Not a word. Nothing. I made a new life. I know. Then why am I here? Because I need you. Where are we? You've got no alibi. No registration anywhere. And Mattei's sure it's you. It's a serious case, you're not getting out. You have to negotiate. Impossible. What do you want from me? I'd have liked to see you but not like this. Then get me out. Your sniper's name is Vincent Kaminsky. Two years ago in Johannesburg, masked men robbed a warehouse. A watchman was hit by a sniper's bullet. He went down but didn't die. We arrested a suspect who was a marksman. He went by another name but it was Kaminsky. Always the same story - No guns, no concrete proof. Beaumont got him off in a few days. Then he disappeared without a trace. Now he's in Paris using the same methods. A marksman. Maybe even from your commando. I couldn't find any military leads. You have to go up higher, like black operations. That's top secret. Even for me. So that's it! You're covering his ass. You get off on your boy shooting cops! We're shit next to your little genius! I want that fucking file! Or the world's gonna know you let a marksman do whatever he wanted. Who are you? Eric, a friend of Vincent's. What do you want? You're more than his lawyer, right? So? We need to get a message to him. That depends on the message. A plan for him to escape. They want to blow open the façade and take the prison by storm. It's completely crazy. What else did Eric say? That it'll be expensive. Money's no problem. I'll tell you where it is. But you have to be careful. Remember my friend David? Some friend! If you hadn't helped him, you wouldn't be in this mess. But we'd never have met either. Listen. Listen to me. Kathy. Look at me. I need you to contact him. Make sure he knows. Okay? I can't. Okay. You okay, Nico? Fine, thanks. How much is a thoroughbred like that? Very expensive. So all your money's in him? I see Théo loaded your car. Going somewhere? Well? To Paris. - I'll go with you. - No way. You're hurt. I have to talk to Anna. Her place is swarming with cops. It's really important. We've got more urgent matters. What? Remember Kathy? Vincent's ex, the lawyer. She wants to see me. Eric contacted her. It's fishy. We gonna bust Vincent out? First, let's try to find out how he got there. Nico, listen to me carefully... Don't move. Turn around. Have you heard from David? I've been calling nonstop. Nothing. Yeah, this is Angelo. Arnaud! Take it easy! Telephone. Nico? - I started to think you'd snuffed it. - I'm okay. I can't get to Anna, the cops won't ease up. Listen. A friend disappeared. Can you tail a guy? No problem. - And then what? - Just report back. I'll handle it. You're Vincent Kaminsky. You're a real star since you got busted. I read all about you in the papers. Marco. Marco Frazetti. I did a few jobs on the outside. Nothing like you though. Nobody here can touch you. You're responsible. Because I don't know anyone who'd get off on torturing a woman like that. Plus, there are more details on your arrest. Police emergency. The marksman you're looking for is at 33 rue des Archives. Wake up, Kaminsky. Your friends sent you to jail and killed the one person who could help you. Why not just finger those motherfuckers? What do you want with that shit Karim? I can't stand seeing two guys like us stuck in this hole. We gotta get outta here! My guys on the outside are ready to help us. Just say the word. You recognize him? He's a real tough guy. No family, no future, nothing to lose. Whereas you... We've got the boss. You're in no danger, talk. I don't even know him. You think I'm an idiot? Where's Nico? - Answer me. - You gonna hit me? You gonna hit me? Go fuck yourself! Fight in the yard over. Five prisoners down. Chief Mattei, this is Marc Grandier, director of the Liancourt Penitentiary. I'm calling about Vincent Kaminsky. We had a hitch this morning. An altercation between the prisoners turned violent. Kaminsky was wounded and I sent him to the hospital. Mr. Director, you're an idiot! It was Frazetti's men, the prisoner who started the fight this morning. They attacked the convoy. Shot them down. I doubt we'll find any survivors. That's Marco Frazetti. Kaminsky set him up. And Kaminsky? Long gone! Where's Eric? I don't know! We don't work together. I've looked everywhere. Where is he? How would I know? You're no use to me. I don't know where he is. I swear. I know some friends of his. We can try them. Okay, let’s go! Get up! Go get the car keys. Whenever Eric's hiding out, this is where I bring him his fix. His morphine. He needs it. You didn't know? That doesn't matter. Go see if he's there. Why me? The cops aren't looking for you. Come back or I'll find you. I'll be back. It's the doc. I'm busy! What's going on? As soon as I mentioned Eric's name, they went nuts. Wait for me here. Don't move. Where's Eric? Don't know him. Don't bullshit me! Why'd you beat up the doctor, if you don't know Eric? I beat him up... 'cause he paid me to. I think you never should've come here. Move! What are you waiting for? Want me to do it? Shut up. I know what I've gotta do. Is that what you said when you tortured Kathy? When you slit David's throat? David? Why are you talking about David? Your best friend. - David's dead? - How could you do that? You gonna shoot me, then Nico? I'd never hurt Nico! You gonna kill him or not? Go ahead! Franck's the one who planned it all. I said if he wanted his money, he just had to ask you. I never thought he'd call the cops. And Kathy? I was supposed to make her talk. He beat me to it. You know I wouldn't have killed her. What did you need? Money. Roll down your window. Roll down your window. What are you gonna do? The doctors talked about an inoperable brain tumor. One clay, I thought I was gonna die. The migraines got worse and worse. Only morphine made it bearable. - Why didn't you tell me? - Would you have kept me on? Sergeant Damien Mattei Died October 8, 2006 Let me go! - What are you doing here? - Where's Nico? That's what I'd like to know! Let me go! That's what I'd like to know! Has he contacted you? - Has he contacted you? - No! There are cops everywhere. Be quiet. What did you do to Nico? What did you do to him? That's enough. Be quiet. I'm pregnant. You wanna see him again? Be quiet. Give me something. Anything. A name. Anything. If you wanna see him again. Arnaud. Maybe. - Who's he? - A gypsy. Where can I find him? Yeah. Your guy's at his old hideout. Angelo and I have tailed him for days. - We know where he is. - Don't touch him. I'm on my way. Lawyer Murdered in Paris Nico, listen to me carefully. Franck Vernon just left Kathy's place. I know you've been waiting. I have one more thing to do. It's too long to explain. They're listening. I love you, Anna. That way! Run! Take off. Run! Go! Take care of her. Nico? Ask for Chief Mattei. I don't know her. What's your name? Sonia. My name's Mattei. I'm a policeman. Who did this to you? Franck. Franck Vernon. We found a body in the woods. KAMINSKY: DESERTER MATTEI: DECEASED CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH CLASSIFIED What really happened there? I want to know what happened to my son. Kaminsky killed him. Don't you wanna know why? Five years ago, we recruited 3 marksmen for a black op in Afghanistan - Kaminsky, Darney and your son. I know all that. We lost contact with them. But Darney got information to us without them knowing. He said that Damien blew a fuse. He was making up his own objectives. Some of them were those of a madman. Then... he ordered Kaminsky to execute civilians. Kaminsky refused. So your son pulled out a knife. Kaminsky turned it against him. Check the gauges. Okay, Dad. You show up here without warning, demanding identity papers within 48 hours? 24 hours. And you say you'll pay cash immediately. Yeah, I've got the money on me! And if I refuse? I'll pay double. Triple, if you want! Does my money smell like shit? Don't get excited! I know you've already called on a few of my colleagues, who all blew you off. They didn't tell you why, but I'll explain it to you. It's not your money that smells like shit, it's you, Franck. Barbara! What are you talking about? No one will help you. Not me or anyone else. Because we all know what you did. The cops have gotten the word out. You're fucked. I don't know what they said but it's bullshit, I swear. Giovanni, I swear, it's bullshit. Let me go! Here, take it! Take it! There's 5, 10 times more. Pick up your dough and take off. Vernon's turning left. He's approaching you. A little more... Two seconds, please. Police! Turn off the engine! Hands on your head! Come on, get out! Hands on the car! Operation concluded. All that interests you is Kaminsky. Vernon's not your problem. Not anymore. Now he's the judges' problem. To dissect that sicko's course. If the sicko makes it to court! What does that mean? I don't know what's between you and Kaminsky but don't forget you're a cop. For fuck's sake! These girls were tortured and killed by that madman! Their parents don't know if they're dead or alive! But to you, Vernon's just bait for Kaminsky! Chief, we've already discussed this for many long hours because the law demands it. But now it's over. I've had it. You're wrong. I just came here to warn you. About what? Vincent Kaminsky. I know, you'll say you've never heard of him. But listen anyway. If you haven't figured it out, he snitched on you. He wanted us to catch you. And you know why? Because now he knows where you are. I'm sorry to say it but I've sort of done his bidding. Can't look a gift horse in the mouth! He's been waiting patiently for two weeks. He's there. Right outside the door. Waiting for me to bring you to the judge. They'll take you out of the paddy wagon and there, on the stairs, just before you enter the courthouse... Kaminsky will put a bullet between your eyes. And I'll watch your brains splatter on the sidewalk. And I won't give a fuck. You're a cop. You can't let him do that. Sure I can. Put yourself in my place. He shoots, you die. It's one less sleazebag on earth. Then I catch Kaminsky. My boss congratulates me. Everybody's happy. Why did you tell me all that? To offer you an alternative. Tell the judge the truth. Give all the details. The number of victims, their names. Be cooperative and you'll live. But if you'd rather try to outsmart us, don't forget the return trip, back to your cell. Mattei, to Position 1. We're here. - Is everything in place? - Yes, boss. Everything's calm here. Position 2. NTR. Position 3. All is calm. Did you see anything? Answer me! Did you see anything up there? Fucking answer me! Boss! I see him. He's on the Châtelet roof. Boss, can you hear me? Okay... Boss, I hit him. He's wounded. Are you sure? Affirmative. Position 2 to Position 3: Mattei left the car. Meyer, can you hear me? Is everything okay? Do you need help? Are you hurt, Meyer? Answer me! Meyer, can you hear me? Fine, don't worry about us. Take these off of me! You can't go anywhere, Vernon. Kaminsky! Vernon left the car. Kaminsky! Drop your weapon. Did my son deserve that?
