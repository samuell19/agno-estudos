So you're gonna just continue this like like you don't see me, like you can't... - I can't. - Wow! There's this sound. Feeling. A presence... A presence, it's in the room and it's getting closer... You sound like you in church... Gotcha! - So, if I put my hands up? - A threat. Threatening. - Slowly? - Provocative. - Showed my palms... - Inflammatory. Could be. Resisting. No. - But somewhere, like... - Definitely no. - To just... But. But... - Uh-uh. Defying. Aggression. - An act of aggression. - But just to show that they're... That won't work that doesn't work son. Belligerent. - I didn't... but I wasn't... - I know. - But by my...? Not even by my...? - Attitude. Concealing. Obscuring. Cocky... But I'm just cold. - Masking. - What? I know, son. - My hands together... - Sarcastic, - challenging, provocative, - But... Mom! Which is, can be, is incendiary to them. Holding hands, holding hands come on... Collusion, complicity, complacency and... Who you holdin' hands with? Attitude, arrogance, insolence, defiance. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't! Don't. Don't son. - Aggressive. - But I haven't... Aggressive. I know, I know, son. Antagonistic. Ignorant. Just hostile. - But... - Hostile. Right. Nuthin about this right. If... If... If I look... If I look at them as a man which you said was good. As a man then, right? Which you said was good. 'Confident', which you said was... how you raised me. We did. So. Confident. Confidence. Confidently looking at them... It's good but not... Good. - It is, but it's not. - If I look away? - Confrontational. - Mom! Bold, evasive, elusive, ambiguous, cagey... But if I turn away... If I turn? Mom, turn away to-to-to... Go to make like I...? No. - If I turn away to walk away... - Son... - Turn, so that I... - No. So then... but I'd be... Impudence, disobedience, impertinence. But I'd be... My back, turn it so that my back... Don't turn your back, don't turn your back. If I look away to avoid looking at... - Guilty... - But if I look like I'm lookin' but just look past... No. Doesn't work, won't work. If I look at the floor... Hell no. We didn't raise you to look at no floor son! Then... But if I... Then... Then. Before the sun got cold, turned the skies to grey, before the wind got busy and rain decided it couldn't be fucked to fall. Before the seasons decided they weren't worth changing we wasn't worth the effort we weren't worth changing for. Before the cars start up before the streets start to fill before the workers work, before the cleaners clean everybody else's dirt. Before the air gets thick before the air gets stale before the air isn't and but... Before the organised call, the call and response before the coverage, the courage, the placards, the publicity. Before the official route, the phone footage, the T-shirts, the graffiti, the street art. Before the famous, before the congregation, before making it family-friendly sound bite-friendly before making us look friendly. You okay? Before leaders appointed themselves before speakers lined up to speak before people stood up and spoke stood up and spoke for me without askin' me if I needed to be stood and spoke up for. Before those that want to be at the front to be seen at the front push up front being up front pushing past to be present. To be seen to be seen. Before it was uploaded - downloaded, offloaded, done... - Son? Before they tried to dissect it disrespect it tried to disrupt it counter it, infiltrate it, to destroy it. Before they thought they got away with it. Before the liberals tried to claim it, reinterpret it appropriate it. Before the dogs spat and the pigs barked and the people spat and the dogs barked, before hateful eyes more hate-filled than their hate-fueled mouths. When actions were actively violent violently violating us and inaction was violent violently violating us. Before our children had no chance to be children, had no choice have no choice but to be involved. When involved was physical, was difficult, was dangerous, is physical, is difficult, is dangerous. Is relentless. When protest was risk... is risk when lynching was sport is sport. When their norms that weren't normal aren't normal were called out are called out called on and challenged. When what's been sanitised was messy was painful is messy, is painful. When what's been epitomised was, is and will be fuckin' hard. Before our history and her-story got, gets, is shiny-fied and simplified by those who were never there. Before those that's sleepin' shout loudest 'bout they woke And how. The wokest of the wokest of wokedom confusin' those that don't know no better confusin' theirselves. Before the dead... Our dead turn in their graves 'til they can't turn no more tossing in their unease. Before all that... Before alla that... I was here. We was. Is all I'm sayin'. It's not a competition. It's not no competition. - It's not... - But if it was... shit. We woulda won. When I was picked up and didn't know why and asked and asked when they told me I was being aggressive - when I weren't. - You weren't. When they said I was shoutin' when I was speakin'... You was speaking. - Then changed it to I was... - Acting aggressive. When they wouldn't answer me when I asked them what "acting aggressive" was, when they changed it to "you're talking aggressive". When they joked at themselves that we all... Sound aggressive. To them, anyway. When they said I was being provocative... And I asked them, "How?" And they said, "Physically." And I asked them, "How?" When there's four a them and one a me. And they said, "Asking was provocative," and I said "Asking ain't physical," and they said... "Your mouth will get you into trouble so best you shut up." When I asked them, "Why me?" "Fits the description of." And the description they described was so shit. It was laughable. When the second of the four said, "Stop that." The third of the four a them cuffed my hands sayin', "See?" I stopped speakin'. But then I started shoutin'. I did start shoutin', fuck it! And my people stopped to see and saw the four of them, and the one of me. Some a the young ones witnessing. Filmin', phones out like a high-tech self defence, but then threatened to keep walking with, "There's nothin' to see here." It being made clearer than crystal what would happen to them if they didn't, so they... An elder shouts back, "Know your rights, sista!" The four of us got more rights than you and we know them better than the few you got that I know you don't even know. Your silence can be used against you in the court of law. Why is all of this even...? You'll get all you need to know down the station. When they said my reluctance was resistance, and my hesitation was obstruction, when they dropped "Resisting arrest" like it was a lyric, dropping me to the concrete like a reflex. When I was pushed in the back into the back of their car cuffs cutting my skin, but holding my shakin' voice to just about not shake and steady say as passively as I can that "I think you have the wrong... " "Your mouth has already got you here. You don't learn, do ya?" When I sat in that cell, with the fourth of the four of them standing on his ones tellin' me how we become unwell can become unwell tellin' me the suicide rates of us in their 'care' tellin' me that they could say to you... I feel sick... - Come on now. - Not sick-sick but sick they got me feeling some toxic mothafuckin'... Excuse my fuckin' language. You ain't the first. Young thing. No way near. Excuse my language. There's been smarter, will be smarter there is smarter I'm not trying to- but they'll be... I say I was the smartest? I say I was the best...? There is smarter there is better than you. You sit and wait on perfect if that's what you waitin' on some-some super freakin' college hero some higher fuckin' being intervenin' in this shit... Young 'un! You sit and wait on that perfect because I never said I was... Could be was... You don't get to put words in my mouth. You waitin' on perfect, still waiting. Your ill-informed not fully-formed half-thinking words in my mouth, shit words in my mouth? You don't get to do that. - I said... - Sir, I ain't said... sayin'... Would say that 'bout me. Sir. So... How you do? How you do this? How you do you? And don't say, 'You know.' - I do me despite the... - I'm doin' me tryin' to do me won't let me be me and I ain't despitin' nothin' I'ma change some shit to allow me to be me... You gonna let me finish? Did you finish? If you finished what you finished we wouldn't... I wouldn't be... You got a short memory and a disrespectful mouth fill one before the other and I suggest you start with that, to affect that. Stop you soundin' like you stupid! Don't shake it for me. - Young 'un you tellin' me what... - No, sir. No Sir, but... I said, give me a reason to not. - It's not easy. - Ask if it was? - Don't get no easier... - I said it did? - It's hard to live with. - I can live with it. Aint in his name. He ain't here to specify that's the point! - He never said for this! - He never said, "Not for this" and if he were still here maybe he would've said "Do somethin'." Do fuckin' somethin'! You do somethin' for me if it was- It wasn't and it aint. You do something for me if it was? Would you? Would you? And if it ain't in his name, there's a list, century-long of names that I could... would... will... do it in if you ain't gonna give me no good reason to not. It will lead to a blood bath. This is a blood bath. - Would lead to a war. - This is a war. - You couldn't survive. - Barely surviving now. You ain't helping. You ain't helpful like this. How has this shit helped? Read a book. What? Then what? Shake your head at a article? See a image, turn over the TV, walk past a protest, then what? Really, how has... and I ain't talkin' about no dusty shit... Young 'un don't question me. Don't. Go listen to those who have lived more than you, years on you, talk quieter than you, and listen harder to them that don't say a damn thing. Look at how they know what they know, what they seen, what they been what they weren't able to be so you could. If you shut your damn mouth for two minutes you wouldn't have to be asking half of your stupid questions, Sir, I ain't... And fuck your disrespectful respect. Excuse my fucking language. Y'dun know! I done somethin' you see me do the thing I done? Shittin' bricks trust me but I know, I knew, I knew you know? Aah! It's like...! It's like... Look at my hands. Look at my hands, they... Look, look, look! That's not me doing nothin'... That's not me tryin' nothin' that's them on their own! That's not even me... Ah, shit! - Shit! - Adrenaline. Fuckin' hell, fuckin' hell! I feel it through my fuckin' chest pumping like a... Could have a heart attack. - You're not having... - Coulda had a heart attack. Could be having a fuckin'... Feel it, feel it, feel it! Fuck it, can you catch a asthma or somethin'? You're not having an asthma attack. - Man, it feels like it. - You're not even asthmatic - for fuck's sake. - It feels like it! No one tells you bein' right is this painful. Trust me, if this is what being right feels like... Man! I done somethin'. I did, I went... - You only went cos I... - I went cos... - You only went because I said. - I went... Because you aint never been before because you started to feel bad you one was missin' on somethin' Went cos I was on you about going from the times I'd been without you, from day. You're late! Gave you shit to watch. You watch it? - Invited you to... - Never knew there was a timetable. - You read what I gave you to... - Never knew I was on the clock. You see what I WhatsApped? What I shot, what I showed, what I exposed, what I spat out on my socials? You watch what I risked while I stood there and stood there, witnessing and recording the Sista shouting from across the way with the four a them in uniform and the one a her - You watch that? - I saw some... Any of that? All a that? Did you even bother? I saw some shaky shit shot from far. Heard you filming and complying with the, "There's nothing to see here," with the, "Switch that off," saw that brief, brave, brief encounter as you switched up, switched off and... You'd never even bothered to come to... Ugh, we all know why you go. Always tellin' everyone... - Knowing why I'm supporting it, yes. - Right on. Large or small, hot or cold, cause after cause. Hear wot. The two minutes I'm there I've done more than you in your two years of attendin' and flyering and talkin' and marching and real talk, achieving fuck all! Wot? I did somethin'. I made a difference, made a mark. Did you even see what I've... Or was you too busy standing at the back from behind the safety of someone's back. Back of the crowd, back of the bus, inconspicuous, ineffective. Maybe you had your head in a book on how to march while I busy upfront doing it. See, if it was me not comin' out of no cell or comin' out of some cell wrong I'd want more than just hashtags of fuckery to your ten family followers or-or filming somethin' from so far back no one can even see what the arse it was we were meant to be seeing. 'Cos if I 'became unwell' I'd want me marchin' for me witnessing, filming more than someone like you. Wot? Nah. If it was me... But it ain't you. Is it? Ain't about you is it? It's about all of us ain't it? What? Me goin' triggered your green-eyed marching monster, is it? From the two-minute fuckin' marcher, glad you had a good time. I ain't saying I had a good time nothin', 'cos you made it clear that would been doing it wrong... - Glad you enjoyed yourself. - That no enjoyment is to be had. Glad you got yourself seen. Take a selfie while you was doing it, did you? I was at the front. People stepping back don't mean you stepped up. I was left up the front stayed up the front which is the same as stepping up. Cos me doin' my little bit looks like it's a little more than whatever the fuck you was doin' from wherever the fuck you was not doin' it. - It was a march. - I marched. - It was a protest. - I protested! - It was a demonstration. - I did that! Did that! I did that and then some. Didn't I? That something will miss you, someone will miss you, miss you hard. Harder than that. - But that's not the point. - No. - That doesn't matter. - No. Means of value, of value. - I am. - Yes you are. Yes you are, but you're not. It means of worth. Know you are. You are more valuable than I could think, than I have thoughts for than I have words for. It means that it would be meaningless without you here. I would be meaningless without you here. Your momma would be meaningless without you here. Your daddy couldn't, wouldn't without you here. I can't even remember when you weren't. Life was just as before you was. My life just is before you was now it's as good as with you in it. Wasn't this as good as before you were in it... And we were good. But since you... You grew me, as much as we grew you, son, that's how much. But that's not the point. If you weren't here it would be a crippling difference. Yeah. An indescribable, crushing, unbearable, agonising, excruciating, horrendous, unspeakable difference if you weren't here son I'd miss you. - Dad... - Your mom would miss you. Me missing him doesn't matter, wouldn't matter. That's not the point. - It means can mean... - Substantial. You are substantial. You are, but you're not. You are, but you're not. You are. I get it from you. And substantial isn't invincible. - Dad is. - Substantial isn't invulnerable. - You are! - Substantial shouldn't have to be, shouldn't need to be... But it needs to be. Substantial isn't unshakable. You don't shake, Dad. Dad don't shake. You don't shake. You shouldn't have to be unshakable, son. But you do. You mean the world to me. You mean the world to me, you mean the world to... You mean the world to us. - It means... - Loved. Loved. You are so loved. - I am. - You are. More than this world could know more than this world owes you. And it owes you. I love you. I know son, but you're not. You are. But you're not. I love you Dad. Love you Mom. Not the point. Dad? Dad. What did you do with your hands? You know, it... I just -. I aint the one to... You still talkin'? I ain't someone to march 'til I drop about it, is all. I know petitioning and politic-ing does fuck all for it, aint gonna hashtag it, aint gonna Instagram it. I ain't a one to kneel and pray about it, sit down, sing about it. I ain't the one with your patience for it. Waitin' on their timetable for it, nah. Progress is a bitch, yeah. Progress is a slow bitch with a wandering mind that drags her bare feet, but change?! Change kicks ass. Change don't give a fuck. Change gonna do its thing with or without you and it moves the fuck on. Change fucks shit up kicks progress' ass, drop-kicks slow, slaps up excuses. And I'ma change shit cos I gotta change this shit - aint got no choice, but to. - You got a choice in how you... I wanna ― see... . Cos we ain't doin' like you. You all like to be liked waited to be liked. You ain't me. You wanted to bring along. I ain't looking their company... - You soundin' younger than you is... - I'll ride this shit alone... You wait for respectable change ain't fuckin' polite. 'Scuse my language. We still having to have the damn talk, having to work around a work around, working around the fucking basics their base behaviors. What the fuck do I even do with my? And I respect the shit thatchu did, even though it don't sound like I do. But you need to respect and accept the fact that it... failed. You... Failed. With all due. Them is still taking liberties still taking mine. They ain't changed. Don't wanna change. They ain't got no intentions of changing. So let's start from there. Give me a reason to not. - Yeah? Same thing? - Yeah. We've done this -. At least. We're on the same page. - We'll speak- - Yeah- Let's do it. Let's do it. Threat... Threatening. - Provocative? - What? Shh! Inflammatory? No. - But you can't just... - Yes, I can. No. Talk to him like a man. He's a man. Aggression? An act of aggression? You're not even sayin' anything. 'Cos you're taking over the whole conversation. Belligerent? Attitude. To them! Oh, nice. Dad! Concealing, obscuring... - No. This is not how it's... - Cocky! Go on then. What, I can speak now? Son? That's all you gotta say? What do you mean 'that's all I've got to say'? - Oh, but... - Look... - What the hell did we...? - After we-? After what we said-? You never said shit. I said something. How would you tell him then? Not like that. You told me you got told... Don't! I'll let him know what I wanna let him know how I wanna let him know, yeah? Cos I know. I would know. Wouldn't I? Challenging. - This isn't... - Provocative. - This isn't how we... - What? This isn't what we said! Arrogance, insolence, ignorance, see? - How? How? - Defiance! Fuck! To them, to them. Too loud. No too loud. - See, I'm doing all the work. - Can I even say anything? Too loud! Confrontational! - Confronting. - Yes. - No! - Yes. No. No! We didn't raise you to look away, son. You don't look away. You don't look at the floor, you don't look down, you don't avert your gaze. We ain't raised you to do that, or be that, son. I called him "Sir" when I didn't have to, afforded him that when I shouldn't have had to. Called him "Sir." turning my empty palms showing my emptier than empty fucking palms. Still called him "sir." As I raised my open, empty hands, quietly called out his wrong rights that he was wrongly quoting, and continued to quote at me more wrongly. Called him "Sir." as I made his wrong position calmly clear, he clearly not appreciating being questioned or corrected, or even in being correct. And he was wrong. But I still said "Sir." Not raising my voice more than my hands though I got every goddamn reason upon reason to that, to do that, but... Calmly called him out without cursing, explaining my civilian position, my civilian rights to his uniformed wrongs and wrongness. Got that right that is right. - Right? - Right. I spoke level, I conversed calmly, I did not speak with my hands or my body. His voice rising, I did not rise with it or to it, his hype rising, I did not rise with it or to it. His control gone. Mine? Intact. That's right. I did not gesture, I did not sharply move, I did not quickly move, I did not make that mistake. I thought I did not make a mistake. When I showed my palms, I called him fucking "Sir." When I raised my empty, tired hands, I called him "Sir." When I moved where he shouted at me to move, stood where he barked for me to stand stopped filming his actions when he screamed for me to stop, at gunpoint, his gunpoint. As I stood there unarmed and alarmed. As I sat there unarmed and alarmed. As I lay there unarmed and alarmed. I still called him... So, if I put my hands up, if I show him my palms, slowly showed my tired, empty fuckin' palms... If I'm struggling with self... Don't struggle with self. Definitely don't struggle with self. Right. Although this shit is enough to drive self to... And I still... called that motherfucker... "Sir." Premier primero. Forst. Danish, baby, first. Top of the damn class. Them symbols, numbers, equations, that everyone thinks is over hard, are under control and is my thing. Head in books 'steada in the clouds, though I'm the one who knows exactly what those clouds is made up of. Ass in the library 'steada out and about and Dad did say, "Don't bother come home if you ain't got what you're capable of gettin'." He funny like that cos that's coming from the man who ain't had nothin' but built himself up to somethin' who I look up to as everything. I focused, and when I brought back my high marks from my hard work, what that brought to my daddy's face... And my girls know not to mess with me when I'm on it. "Geeking out", their words, not mine know not to distract with their, "Leave her to it, y'all." The brothers know “Oh, she gone in.” Letting me alone and proud of me sticking with it. So, I knew, before we saw, what I felt, when I felt, what we felt. We gotta step but the mood is still tight, vibes still hype, holdin' on to each other for collective heat as we placard holding, chanting, our anger sang as we marching our fury, crowds of us, was us is us. Beautiful. Collectively strong. Loud and prouder than proud, a dark sea of us as far as anyone can see. And they have and always have had, something in hand, in they hands fearing a fair fight. And we pass the old woman that's always out. Always out first looking at us like we late, looking at us like we ain't serious. But this downwind tingle in my mouth is starting to... We gotta move, people! I get some turned heads for my cold girls, "Huh"? A too late “What?” from the freezing Brothas as the flash-bang does its job. Hearing snaps back, jarred back by my hacking and choking and hacking and choking of us all the shouts and screams of us all tears swelling, racing, falling, swelling, racing, falling, not of sadness or anger, too sad for that, too angry for that, but my eyes trying to flush out the chemical irritant that is infecting them. And that old woman who been out here from before time goes down. My skin burns it's meant to. My nose burns it is meant to breathing feels like you can't, throat getting to closing, and closing getting to choking I'm... I'm drooling like a baby. Yo, don't rub your eyes! Don't rub your eyes, y'all! Beautiful crowds of us scattering, vomiting, crying, panicking, placards dropped, chanting stopped, messaging blocked, marching forgot, protesting fucked. Black bodies staggering into each other red eyes barely seeing a watery half-nothin' running the wrong way, cos no right way can be seen through that milky white mist. As the Storm... Mothafuckin' Troopers keep advancing, barking at us to "Clear the streets! Clear the streets!" Knowing full fuckin' well we can't. Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile. To those who didn't study them symbols, numbers, equations, they science, they chemistry, they physics... Teargas... is a motherfucker. Now you mad at me. Now you're mad. I'm not mad at you. Sir. I take out the one who could be the father of the father of the one who could be the father of the father of the one who takes out a son of yours, that could be the son of your son. I take out that father of the father and history is better for it. And your son of your son could be the real change maker. Real game changer. Revolutionary. So I could've played my part in a little way with a big repercussion, that's a big, good thing done. A really motherfuckin' big change. In a small way. In a one, small action. That small action, my small action, that's all that I'm sayin'. You won't know who the father of the father... - Neither do you. - Or the mother of the mother, or the child of the child would or could be. You losin' your own argument before you... The risk of being right is a risk worth takin'. It... It would be in cold blood. It's fire with fire. Give you sleepless nights. - Can't sleep now. - It won't look good. How is this looking good? Would bring a backlash, more of a backlash... I'm' just lashing back the backlash lashing me. I'm provoked. - It would bring... - Have been for centuries. And the backlash lashes back at the drop of a hat their drop of a hat, don't it? You're... You're better than that. But... This ain't working. Is it. You know... when I was picked up and didn't know why, when they said I was being aggressive, and I weren't. When they said I was shouting when I was speaking, I was speakin'. When they said I was acting aggressive when I never was... You wasn't. And told to shut up when I asked them what acting aggressive is, when they switched that I was talking aggressive, then joked to themselves that we all sound aggressive to them anyway. When they said I was being provocative and when I asked them, "How"? They said, physically. And when I asked them how, when there's six of them and one of me, they said, "Your mouth is gettin' you into trouble, so best you shut up." When I asked... they smiled. "Fits the description of" but the description they described, was so shit. So shit. So shit. Again. When they said, the second of the six, that I was gesturing aggressively, and my palms raised in a passive, the second of the six cuffed them. Saying, "See? See?" When they told me to stop speaking, so I stopped speaking, and the second of the six who had cuffed me smiled, saying my silence could be used against me in a court of law. When they challenged me to say something, I said nothing. When they provoked me to say something, I said nothing. When they... When they mocked me to speak, provoking me to get a reaction, I said nothing. They in my face, said nothing, said nothing. I said nothing. They daring me to do something, to do anything, and when I still said my nothing, they challenge me, agitating me, goading me, taunting me, mocking me saying my nothing, and when I didn't react to anything, they baiting me to do somethin' say anythin' and when I did react, they said I was resisting arrest. When they said my hesitation was obstruction, dropped "resisting arrest" harder, than they dropped me to the concrete, sayin' I'm makin' it worse for myself... With their knees in my back, five of the six... I couldn't think how much worse it could fuckin' get. Then it was. Worse. In the back of the van. When they watched me when I wouldn't, then shouted again, "Strip." "We told you to strip." When I wouldn't and didn't, and the second of the six, not smiling now, said that I would. How I would, how I will, that I will. I still wouldn't. "Not gonna tell you again." When I was standing in my boxers... like a fuckin' five-year-old... trousers around my... "Strip." "Thank you for your cooperation." Just like... Like... like it was... Like... Like it was fuckin'... Fuck. I put my hands up. A threat. Threatening. It was slowly. That shit don't matter. - But I didn't...? - Aggressive. - No, but I... Come on! - Aggressive. - Just to show that they're... - Doesn't work. Doesn't work, hun. It was slowly. Attitude. - It's cold! - Attitude. Cocky, concealing. - But I'm... - Aggressive. - No. I was just... - I know. Holding hands. Holding hands. Come on! I put my hands up, I raised them slowly... I slowly showed my empty palms. Did you see? Did you see? - Does it matter that I do? - What I had the nerve to do? You there to be seen, doing it, or what? You need me to see you doin' it. You want an audience. What? Or you doing what you doin' cos you know why you doing it... - Did you see from the back? - Or you dunno what you're doing and you're confused why you're doing it. Back of the crowd, back of the bus, back of the line, polite, liked. That where you was? Again? Could you see from there? Could you see me from there? I wasn't looking for you. Did you hear the, "Yo! Don't rub your eyes y'all"? You hear that from the Sista way over from wherever you-? Did your eyes burn like mine did? Or was you too up wind when I was down of it? Was you rush rinsing your eyes with water - any water, stung by the evil clouds of fuckin'... . Or you just stood? Casually sipping yourn, watchin' the carnage you couldn't really actually see cos you so, so, far back. Shit. This ain't about you. It ain't about me, but it's about me. Collective. - Selfish. - Communal. - Self-centered! - Empowering. Egotistical! I was on point up front. Made a difference. Made a mark. Made my mark. And me doin' my little bit looks like it's a little bit more'n you, and whatever the fuck you was doing, have been doin', not doin', at the back. It was a march! Marchin' days is over. It was organised! Which does what? It was a protest! Protests fail. It was a demonstration! Demonstratin' what? Again, again, again. They don't listen they haven't listened and I ain't waiting no more to be heard. They ain't changed... They don't want to! I ain't wait no more for them to bother. I demonstrated. Demonstrated that these hands - my hands. Don't fuckin' play. Man. They offer crumbs. You want a slice. You want a slice? I want the fuckin' pie. - Twelve? - Twelve. Not eight, then? Someone said that wrong, written it down wrong somewhere and it's been lazily repeated. - It was... - You're lazily repeating it. - A male child... - A boy... Yes. Well observed. - I... - Almost teenage, and... but you know, a father leaving is damaging in a boy. Developing years... Damage... Damage done. - But I think that... - The studies say, the studies... - But I think... - The studies say, and I didn't come to you to ask you what you thought. You've come here to ask me. I'm here, you're... But the mother, the mother wanted... You know, the leaving of the father from the family home at around that age, for a child, or a boy, or that boy, is dramatic. It's traumatic. But... The kids testified they were comfortable... What I've told you, am telling... There was very little drama... Explaining, is that it was a factor. Possibly... Probably traumatic to that 12-year-old child. - Any child. - That 12-year-old. - Any child, though. - Specifically. Specifics, yes? Yes? No, sir. - I think that... - You've read what I've read? I'm sorry, you've studied what I studied? - I... - You've got the... that I've got? That's the no. I welcome discussions. Discussions I do and I welcome... - No, I... - And I'm open and up for that, but equally, I welcome people to admit when they're... Yes? And I appreciate, I'd appreciate people here who come in here, asking whatever it is you're asking to have read the studies and done your homework - before they... - I have. Or, if they don't know about, or... have a lack of... There is nothing wrong in that. In admitting that. In saying that. And I know there's worse, I do know there's worse than what he may have. He had sisters... And although not totally comprehensive, the studies say... One older sister, one younger, both okay, both normal. - Normal? - Yes, and that... Normal? Now, that's a term. And as far as we... They're fine, is what I meant... Fine? Normal? Now, are we gonna have to... - What I mean... - You know, those terms... I know. - I... Yes. - A little outdated. - Yes, I meant... - Yes. Do you? Yes. - Relative. - Very. - I meant... What I meant... - A course, more than one course for learning about those kinds of terms. - Did you? - I don't have to... - Have you? - I don't... didn't... Don't need to. You think? I am not underestimating you. I would appreciate it if you... Thank you. And... But, with domestic violence thrown in... There was no domestic... With domestic violence in the mix... - There was no domestic violence. - I... With abuse of any kind. There was no abuse. Documented or stated. Sir. Well, we don't know exactly. We don't know what's normal behind closed doors, do we? The mother categorically said... Who's fine behind closed doors. The kids said no, as well as the sisters, I mean. The normal sisters? - I said... - Are you speaking for them now, as well as for everyone else? Maybe the father was good at it. Left no bruises, left no marks... Bit of an expert at it. Maybe he was as good at what he did, as I am at what I do. It's completely different, kind of, you know, but... Anyhow, an open... An open mind and an open attitude are vital. It's critical. Crucial. The mom worked part-time... Now you're mumbling. The mom worked part-time as a supportive, loving homemaker, God-fearing... Dad worked. The dad worked. Three kids between them, all academically average, income average or just above, if it was a good year. Economically stable, childhood sweethearts, married young, too young... - In your opinion. - Drifted apart and separated amicably - I think if you read the report, studied the studies... - There's nothing... And it's not my opinion I've studied... - The studies it's in the report... - Then you would see- - There's nothing to see. - You seeing it how you're seeing it, is subjective. You seeing it your way isn't necessarily 'fine'. - I... What I... - Or have I got to fall in with you so we both can see it your way? Your right way? Which is only a way, by the way. And is wrong. Anything else you wanna state? That I disagree. Got that. Think I'm capable of... My problem is... My problem with you is... I didn't come here to be a problem. - My... - I didn't come here to be a problem, sir. He was, actually still is, as he's incarcerated now, the son, not the husband, a damaged young man who did a damaging thing. - 'Damaging!' - A young man doing a one-off act, who gained access to firearms, legally held within the house, his mother's house, after the father had left, and who the mother, ironically, and it's in the report, - I've read it. - Asked her husband, ex-husband, to leave the firearm with her as she felt that she and the girls, - and of course the son... - I've... would feel more vulnerable without it. - I've... I've read it all. - All... That she ends up being, is sadly ironic and unfortunate. A fantasist, destructive one, yes, but a one-off, violent act by a young, damaged fantasist, by a boy, who by all means had issues, that may have been exacerbated by the leaving of his father when he was 12. - Twelve. - Twelve, yes. A fantasist. He's that. Specifically. - Nothing spontaneous. - No, no. Researched. Before you could Google your destruction of choice. Not an adolescent, not 11, not 8. This one went with a friend. But he wasn't, you know, they... I don't think you know they would've had their whole social circle... Exactly. They had a social circle. No one's saying they were popular. People knew them, they knew people. And it was 12, but who really knows who. - What? - Who really knows... - But... - Who do you know? - Sir, I... - Really know, you know. - This isn't about me, so I... - No, but I was just... Who do you know? Really know then. Sir. I... I don't really care who you do or don't know. And your lack of an answer does really answer... - I know people. I know people. - I know people. I really know people. They really know you? - This isn't about... - No, it's not, but do they? It is about my point, as I've said. You... Your people really know you then? Or you don't got no one to know you good in the first place? Just trying to understand your point. Now, that's just sounding petty. - If he... - They. They had a large enough social circle, someone would stop him. Them. So, I think my theory the theory, the studies stand. Not if their social circle all thought like them. Which would just make them all wrong. - My point. - All being wrong, isn't the point. You could be wrong. Your friends, if you have any, I'm not prying, could all be wrong. A hundred and twenty dead. Right-wing radical disaffected. - That's the... - Eighteen children. A disaffected right-wing radical with his friend, is the point. - They were... - Non political. Well, being pissed off with the government isn't exactly political, and would cover most of it. - But they were... - No. - Both... - A domestic, homegrown act of violence carried out on a large scale, I'll give you that. Unprecedented, I'll give you that. A homegrown act of violence carried out by disaffected right-wing radicals, that, yes. Specifically yes. It's what they were. Are. Those two. Yes. Kids shooting kids isn't confusing. They were high school by high school. Not confusing. And these ones weren't loners, and they weren't poor and they weren't isolated. - One of them was depressed. - Had got beyond 8 or 11 years old, which you seem to find so risky for your... Twelve, and your sarcasm isn't helpful. I'm just making sure we've covered... - It's how you're... - No, no. - Yes. - I'm just trying to not... No, you're not. One of them was struggling with... He vlogged, I think that's the term for it. He vlogged it, though nobody seemed to be watching, seemed to have followers of exactly two. Depressed. And obviously being depressed and being teenage, - can be a difficult... - Depression is not an answer. - We're not doing answers. - Depression is not an excuse. - I'm not giving excuses... - Teenage is not... I'm giving reasons, if you would let me, even. Reasons that are in the studies. Two armed teenagers shooting unarmed teenagers at their same school... One really was depressed, probably clinical. Actually, he wrote a manifesto. And the other? - You know, I think... - Was a bit sad, was he? Drew a picture of intent on a Post-It? - I'm really starting to think... - And you know, really, I'm just trying to... - Starting to think that you... - I am just... I dunno why... - I'm just making... - Why you're not taking this seriously. - I'm taking this as seriously... - Why are you even here? Why are you here? I am absolutely serious about this. Sir. The second follower he had on his vlog, was his friend. The only one they could find, which was unfortunate, as together they became, well... The depths of disaffection can be destructive. Disaffection. - And coupled with... - Their young, tender years. You wanna be taken seriously... - I'm disaffected. - You're disaffecting. - Sir, I just... - What? - You're saying teenage is a factor. - Yes. Filming a miserablist vlog and writing a note is a definition? The studies say... Being disaffected is justification... - What I'm... - For you... An aspect for those two specifically. All those definitions afforded and... and both male... - No, it's not. - Is an aspect - both from... - No, it's not. Those specific two individuals. - Both are... - Not the issue. - Both are... - Not the point, not an issue. And again, you know, if I can just get a word in edge ways. - I... - It's domestic. Domestic is different, and depression is mental health, and mental health is a whole load of other issues right there. I get depressed. I get depressed but... And to make it personal. I don't load up, take aim and start... This is your way of trying... And I've come through teenage, somehow managing - not to massacre... - They aren't you. They aren't me, but me, we aren't allowed to be them. And are you? Are you... depressed? - I'm fine, but you see my point? - No. - The fact that I... Mental health... - Actually, no. - Are you, or aren't you? - What? - Having a good day? - A depressive. Aah! I... Yes. Yes. I am. And it's a bit of a bullshit argument... I think you're... I think you're sort of taking what I say... Excuse my language, sir, bullshit to try and make that... What I was trying to say, you know, taking it out of... And it's not helpful to make it personal. I didn't need you to disclose... - I didn't disclose I just made a point. - Disclosure's personal. I answered your question and made a valid... And personal gets emotional, and neither are useful in this context. This is not... - As I said... - Really, this is not me... And I don't appreciate your use of bad language, by the way. And as I've said, we are not here to talk about you. This is not me emotional. She said emotionally. With all due respect, I think your personal is clouding your judg... You know, it may have been personal to the seven dead classmates whose two peers armed themselves with semi-automatics, pipe bombs and a plan, not forgetting the handwritten 'manifesto'. I think that was very personal to those murdered. Sir. I'm not saying they're not bad. - Or disaffected. - 'Disaffected'! - Depressive? - A depressive psycho, no offense, with a death wish, and an evil young man with no moral compass. An absolute domestic, high school, non-political disaster. - No. - A cultural phenomenon that can sometimes manifest itself within some teenagers. Yours? You want... a small word for a big subject. But... So. No. Specifics. Yes? Specifics matter. You and your personal issues don't. Dear God. He had parents. We don't blame the parents. - You don't blame the parents? - Not the parents. He had family. - We don't blame the family. - You don't blame the families? You can't blame the family. You don't blame your families? - Families aren't accountable for it. - But ours are. Do you blame their upbringing? A lone wolf may have specific psychopathic tendencies - that may have been missed. - I'm taking that as a no. Mental health? Asperger's, autism, one of those undiagnosed, - is suspected. - Killer autism. On the spec... Semi-automatic, automatic pistol killer Asperger's autism. I've got Asperger's. - I've got... - Have you? Have you. I don't quite... I don't quite get why you are... No, you don't, do you? I'm just saying another aspect of... And interestingly, this lone wolf came from a single parent. Dad had left some time earlier. - 'Twelve'? - No, 14, actually. - Fuck. - I'm sorry, what? What is it about facts that you're finding so hard to... His act wasn't political, he acted in isolation, and he may have had issues with his mother. It was his mother's gun, in fact, he shot his... - I know. - It's unfortunate. And there's other factors. - Seventeen dead. - A psychopath. - 17, excluding his mother - Yes. 19, including him, if you wanna include him. Well, if... If he really matters. Well, there was a marriage breakdown with his parents, actually. - 'Actually'. - A possible factor. My marriage broke down, and I didn't kill, feel to kill, or actually have the urge to kill 18, 17 strangers. Funnily enough. Maybe had the urge on occasion to hunt down my ex but that would be me making it too personal again. Maybe I should have written a manifesto. Your sarcasm isn't welcome. Maybe that was me in my depressive state me being too fucking emotional. Your language is really leaving a lot to be... - He was... - Dysfunctional, psychopathic tendencies undiagnosed. - He was a... - Tragedy. A homegrown, heartbreaking tragedy. Not trying to change minds, or... or change politics, or... Just a tragic, acting alone with possible mental health, along with access to a firearm... Several. Well, I'm not saying it's not a disaster. It's a disaster. A homegrown tragedy for all involving the lone wolf young man. Terror-fying. People were terrified. - Children were... - I'll give you that terrified is part of the definition, but that's as close as it gets. He used a gun, guns. The case is different. - No, no. - Slight, but different. And he's... from here. You're trying to minimize and simplify. I didn't say anything. Copycats is what they are. Copycats. - It's a known... - Copy cat killers, warm and fluffy. That's not helpful. You all have nine lives. You're not being helpful. Not here to be helpful. You have a talent for twisting what I... And yes, you're not, and no, I don't. Mm? Have nine lives. You do, and you don't even know it. Why do you make this harder than it needs to be? Cos something like comments like that, - really don't help. - I'm not here to help. I'm only... I'm trying to definitively and precisely and concisely... - I'm just trying to understand... - Have this conversation... How you persistently and consistently manage - to not say... - If I could finish? And keep a straight face while you're doing it. If I could finish - if I could finish my point! You'll finish your point. If you let me finish my point. When have you not ever not finished your point? I think... you have issues pertaining to you. I think you, as you have admitted, have some... unique to you, that I didn't and don't want to know about. And it's quite ironic, it is quite ironic that you brought up the word 'normal', coming from someone like... I think, cos sitting here, hearing your painstaking details, your theories, their theories, their studies, your studies, their reasons - your reasons, and following that shit through, I'm starting to conclude that you and your non-subjective studies are full of fuckin' shit. Sir. You asked me. Come here and asked me, so, I don't understand, I'm just trying to... You wouldn't know where to start. Okay, some other cases... So, okay, some are just angry. What have they got to be angry about?! You're not prepared to listen to my facts. Do you really wanna start on anger? - I'm sticking to the facts... - And justification? - You're starting to get... - Depressed? You're depressing me, that's for sure, compared to... What the fuck have you got to be angry about? We are not here to talk about you and if you're not gonna listen then what's the point? What is the point? Exactly. You know, you're coming across as quite angry. Quite an angry... Aggressive, even. Are you having an episode, of whatever that autistic Asperger's thing you have is? Did you ever get checked for that? Can give you a number for somebody if you... Please fuck off. Childish now. Just trying to be... Political. - Barely deserves an answer. - Structural. Societal. Well, we all live in a society... Organized. - Being organized, isn't... - Violent. In itself, violence isn't... - Racist. - Different conversation. - Religious. - Not a crime. You're confusing yourself. Murderers. You've answered your own question. A murderer is that, just that. - Multiple murderers. - Are just that. I mean, I could go on, I think I will go on. Are you depressed again are you one of those manic ones? Supremacists. I see what you're doing. - Trying to, but... - White supremacists - white male... - No! No. By their definition, you just used their definition... - The clue is in the title. - Murderous, murdering... - Said that. - Mass murderers. We can all list, you know. Not helpful. Child murderers. Yes, indiscriminate, but... - Indiscriminate? - Indiscri... Well, maybe that's not quite the right... No. It's not. In every office of every county in every state in this country. Extremists. Depends where you stand on... Fanatics, fundamentalists. This is just starting to feel like name-calling - which is... - Very discriminate, very precise, very accurate, if we're gonna use our definition and this language 'specifically'. A... A homegrown domestic vigilante racist, organized subsection of society with religious leanings, their religious leanings... Bullets, bombs burnings, hangings lynchings, mutilations, shootings, destructions, defacing, torture, imtimidations, abominations, perversions, organized, militarized, uniformed, hierarchical, vitriolic, ritualistic, political death cult European Protestant immigrant- psychopathic- white-sheet-wearing cross-burning motherfuckers. Terrorists. That definition doesn't work, as I have explained... With your lone wolves, your mentalists, your fantasists, your disaffected your explicit fucking excuses for you.
