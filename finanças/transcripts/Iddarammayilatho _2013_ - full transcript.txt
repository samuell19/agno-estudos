Whoever is involved in the mining scam... I want to know the names of wrong doers! Start your inquiry in such a way that it'll deter recurrence of such wrongs! Sure! - What is your name, sir? - Rajesh Varma! Varmaji! What is your problem! People like you looting the country is my problem! In the guise of coal ore are you guys not smuggling diamond? Varmaji! Coal contains carbon! Diamonds too contain carbon! Because women like diamonds we are selling them! You too have a wife! Doesn't she too want diamond? Will you follow my counsel? Think well before you act! Never! Give the phone to the guy standing near you! Sir! Sir! Tell us sir! What is this? Have all of you come here? What have you got to say about the high tech scam? What is your share in that? How many of you are there? It is true there was corruption in the deal! But I have nothing to do with that! - That is why I am still a minister! - Not that, sir! - We hear about lakhs and crores! - Who is that? Come here! Come! Lakhs and crores! How could you say that so casually? How could you talk about money like a video game score? Without knowing the facts Please don't talk like this! - No, sir! - Let me finish! My daughter is on a tour! Let me talk to her for 2 minutes! After that I will answer all your queries! Please move a little! Sir answer this before you go!

Name and Photo are very fine! Gomathy! What is inside your golden box? Diary! Is this diary yours? Is it personal? Should no one read it? Then I will start reading it right now! How can I discard it?

You leave that aside and learn some other good instrument! Other than that any other instrument is good enough! 'Today is the first day in my college life!' 'I was going to the college with the violin dad gave me' 'lt was my bad luck that I saw him then!' 'What happened was totally unexpected!' Wait, wait No! My God! Take care! 'The violin of my great grandpa was shattered to pieces!' 'How will I inform this to my dad?' All men are like this! They will do only what we expect them not to do!

New Joinee! Miss Gomathy Shankarabaranam! - I want to meet Mr. Brahmma! - Which Brahmma? - Fiddle Brahmma! - Fiddle Brahmma? Go inside! He is playing! Stop!

I want to see that priceless fiddle of that great musician! Please permit me to see it I want to touch it! I want to feel it! That fiddle can never be seen again! What happened dear? - It's gone! - Where has it gone? Not anywhere master! It is broken! You mean broken! How? What ever may be the problem... Your dad should never come to know about this! Then not merely the fiddle you will lose your dad too! You are right master! Leave it! Was your fiddle broken by Sanju? - Who is Sanju? - He is a loafer! With a marked hair style... Not lanky, at the same time not too short... ...a medium stature guy ...might look like a guy who had six pack Abs earlier ...but doesn't have one now Is he the guy? Yes master, he is the guy! I know about his monkey pranks! If I get a chance to talk to God... ...my first question to Him would be ...why did he allow an idiot like him to be born? He is a fungus that affects music! He has a band and few donkey groups to sing! I will tell you where they are! Go and get your fiddle! If you come back without the fiddle... I would peel and put you in... Go Thank you! Thank you! Thank you very much! Are you a Malayali? My God, seems she is a dumb girl Poor girl! No, there is nothing wrong with me! - Can you talk? - Then why did you mime? Yesterday during that incident... ...didn't you break a fiddle? That is my great grandpa's When did I break a fiddle? Yesterday you chased a white man... ...hit him and broke his head Don't you remember that? Then did you not hear the breaking sound of a wood? - Yes! - That wood was mine! That wasn't an ordinary wood! It was our family food! I am sorry! Now you can't get back what had gone! If you don't have any issues can I get you a new one? - Oh thank you, sir! - You are welcome ma'am! You are not as bad as I heard about you! - To me you look polite! - Who said we are bad? - My master said so... - Whom do you mean? Our professor fiddle Brahmma! Are you the student of fiddle Brahmma? - What's your name dear? - Gomathy! - Why did you come here? - To learn music! What will that fool teach you? He evokes boredom! Don't talk ill of my master! - Return my fiddle! - I wanted to return... But since you mentioned his name now no chance of you getting it back! I will complain about this to my master! Jeez! - Are you our enemy? - My god!

Hi! - What are you doing here? - I play guitar here! - Where is your band? - What do you mean by that? Where is your gang? How do you know I have a gang? I am a psychology student! If I scan for 2 seconds... I would get 100 print outs about you! Is psychology such a peachy thing? Is it possible to know about everything? Not everybody can do it! Only gifted personalities like me know it! Is it? What do you know about me? Tell about me... if I would drink liquor or not? If I am a sadist or not? What is my profession? Do I know music? Or am I simply carrying a guitar? Tell me! Play my CD! Psychology is not about telling known facts! It is about telling what you don't know! Anyway your time is good! I have not analysed it so keenly! Now I am going! For the time being I have escaped! If he had asked anything else I would have been trapped! Why should I be so hasty! I could have done it after reading it fully! You loafers! Monkeys! You messy... Instead of trembling at the sight of my student... ...have you guys insulted her? Was it not a despicable conduct? Because you guys are not sound in mind will you guys swallow an ember? For the sake of a trivial fiddle don't bark like this! Whose fiddle is trivial? If my fiddle is trivial What about yours? How about this guitar? How about this drums? How about this worthless keyboard? I tell you these are loony instruments! - Who are you to talk about them? - What? Did you ask me, who I am? Western music shrouded our pure classical music's glow! I protected that glow with my two hands... like this ...I brought it up to Europe! Will you be able to blow it out? My God! He has blown it! Didn't you see him blowing? He would never prosper Never prosper! Seeing you guys the goddess of music has walked out weeping many times! For the sake of you guys... ...many times I have fallen at her feet and pleaded with her! I don't know how many times more I may have to do it? You blare like a damaged speaker! That makes me doubt your music credentials! Are you saying I don't know music! Me and music are synonyms! I am the music and music is me! Ok! Let us check who is great You or we? - Ok, let's see! - Take care your string doesn't snap! Clasical or western! We will prove today which is great! - Ready? - Ready!

Why plead sorry? To a great musician like me... ...you guys don't even deserve to say sorry If you insist on saying sorry... ...go to her, take her hand put fiddle on her hand ...and say sorry, go! I am sorry for disturbing you! For disturbing me, thanks! What? Why were you born so gorgeously? You were born in some other country! Why did you come to a country where I live? When there are so many people why should you meet me? If I don't get sleep in night Can I make a call to you? What is your number? If I feel like seeing you suddenly shouldn't I jump the walls? What is your address? My God! He is not an ordinary guy! If one praises a girl so much which girl would not fall for that? Anyway he didn't say he lost the competition for her sake Do you know I lost it for your sake! My God! He is not like what we think of him! He is a brainy guy! 'My mind is now filled solely by Sanju!' 'I want to meet him!' 'Truly speaking I want to join his batch!' 'I am craving for that!' Gomathy! If you lose control of your mind concentration would become confusion! No confusion master! - My concentration was on guitar! - What? - I would like to learn guitar! - Do you want to learn guitar! I would give you a whack! Discarding auspicious fiddle, are you going to learn that wretched guitar? Do you know who you are? Are you conscious about your lineage? You are from Shankarabaranam family! I have lot of expectations about you! To shatter western music I have a design You are my missile to accomplish that! I would not agree for that even at the cost of my life! If you discard this and go to Sanju I would not keep you here Bear in mind about my warning! From Indian banks unaccounted money... ...cores of rupees, I mean millions of US dollars ...are to be transferred to your bank! To transfer such a large sum... Indian embassy would ask for finance clearance from your embassy! My man has already gone there! Explain him! When I make a proposal to someone... I don't like them saying 'no' I will give you 24 hours time! Fix a price and say yes! Get on... Master has told me not to ride on your bike! I say get on to the bike! Don't tell master! We can go! Where are we going? Tell me! - It won't happen! - What is he saying? He is not agreeing! Do you know with how much difficulty... ...we brought that much cash from India? Millions of dollars are waiting here A single account is enough to deposit that money in your bank If you say it is impossible Agree for it - Tell me! - Keep quiet! Where are we going? Please tell me Sanju! - Get down! - What happened? I said get down! Why did you ask me to get down here? When I take you with me with great love... I don't like you asking me queries like where and why! You stay here! Move! If you don't come back within 5 minutes... ...let you and the bike be blasted! Go and get the girl! Bring her to me! I want her! Come get on! Come! Let's go in to the woods and talk! If boys wish to take me to beach or woods... ...I have been instructed not to accompany them! - My mom said so... - Is it? Did my mom ask me to take girls like this? Nothing will happen there! Don't think you only have a mom! Come! Gomathy! I have milled around with lot of girls! But I didn't like any of them, but you... Have you milled around? Milled around with lot of girls! Don't let your imagination go wild! At an young age in school and college... ...don't we sometimes mill around with many of them? You would have also milled around! I meant only that! Gomathy! I love you so much! Our physical traits match! Both of us are doing music! Besides we are in Europe! Let us enjoy life! - I don't believe in love! - I too don't believe... That's why I liked you after seeing your character! Not looking at your beauty! What! Am I not beautiful? Not so beautiful that doesn't matter! Is not my character super than my beauty? Hundred percent! What is my character? When you are alone... When you know no one is looking at you... ...whatever you feel is your character! I have understood that! That's why I liked you! Is it? Then how will I understand your character? What do you do when you are alone? Should I tell everything openly? You can make a guess! Some times I may walk around naked! I may watch blue films! - My God! - Who knows...? At that time the 'alien' character within us comes out! If we study that character we can understand who we are? We are here together! Did we do anything wrong? That's what I also said! Nothing happened! It is all mere gossips! So when youngsters like us call you... ...please come with us! We are terribly grieved! You must understand our plight! Dinner is over! I have changed to night wear! Then what did I do? I can't comprehend my own character! Then how did he comprehend? - Hello! - Hello Sanju! Hi! - Are you staying alone? - Yes! - What are you doing now? - I am opening the door! - Where? - At your house! Hi What is this Sanju? Why did you come here? Why are you removing your shirt? Why do you stare at me like this? Sanju, are you our class? Are you a brahmin? Bapnese! What is Bapnese? Is it Japanese? Converted Brahmins Bapnese! Are there converts among Brahmins? Why not? When everyone can convert why not Brahmins? Why should you be so cast conscious? - Jeez! - To avoid future complications! What future complications would come? Gomathy! I love you! Please Sanju don't do anything to me! What did I say and what are you talking? I said I love you! If I say ok will you do something to me? It seems if I don't do anything you may feel very bad! You are expecting something from me Gomathy! - No, Sanju! - Just one kiss! You wouldn't stop with one kiss! What? I said Sanju wouldn't stop with one kiss! So you agree for a kiss! But you wouldn't stop! That's my desire too! No, Sanju! Same room, same place same bed! Talked like that... Talked like this... Somehow boys convince... Though he is soft... ...he doesn't fit in with my psychology test! I would stab you with this knife! Are you so courageous? Come on man! If you have courage, come on! Why did you ask me if I stay in the same room? Are you planning to come here? Come on man! When I am alone... why is my character like this? Am I so wild? Hey you...! Shit! I have understood everything about you! Complete! What do you know about me? Do you have the habit of picking up girls standing alone in road? You would cajole her... ...and take her to woods and converse with her! - Yes or no? - Yes! I know... Your behaviour pattern is worse than that! During night you would jump walls and go to rooms of girls! Who said all these things to you? You said your face says everything! Did you believe psychology is drollery? It's a science! You know that! I have understood it only now! Don't tell this to anyone else! Please! Keep it secret! Drop you? Ok! - Let's go! - Ok! Thank you! - Bye! - Bye! Hello! Now he is dropping you! - Lucky guy! - Ya, he is! 'He is my courage' - Your name? - Gomathy! - Where are you from? - India, sir! Why do you shoot the company? Is it for time pass? Do you know I am going to kidnap you? Leave me, please! Please! 'lf he had not come there at that time...!' Who are you? Who are you guys? Who are you guys? What is it that you want? Who are they? They have come looking for you! I don't know, Sanju! Why should they kidnap you? Have you done any mistake here? What did I do? I don't even know them! Just think, if you have done anything! If I had come a minute late what would have been your plight? Fox like, but smart! What a funny name? Did I not tell you mom about me reading a diary? This is the title I have given for that! At what stage is the story now? That girl could not be found yet! But he comes daily sees and talks with me It is all happening! But even now he doesn't know about me reading this diary! Why do you tell me in piecemeal? Can't you read it fully and tell me? How will I mom? Just after reading 2 or 3 pages I become romantic! I would pillory you! Hi love! Why are you here alone? When there are so many people around how will I be alone? Are you waiting for someone? No one to come! - Sanju! Will you teach me guitar? - No! - Please, can't you teach me? - No! - Are you loving someone? - Ya! Tell me something... Who knows better about love Boys or girls? What! Should there be a question like this? We only know! The concept of 'love at first sight' was discovered by us! We only get love at first sight! The moment we see a girl... ...without any second thought we only say 'I love you'! From the day this world came in to existence... ...no girl has ever said 'I love you' to a boy at first sight! That will never happen! Then how is it... His character, background, foreground... ...only after cross checking all these she would say her love to him If I have to add something more Even from a handsome hero she would ask for an autograph... ...only after 2 or 3 of his movies become a box office hit Girls motives are so commercial! Why should you ask such questions to me... ...and get replies like this? Do you have the habit of writing diary? Why do you ask? Girls can't keep anything in mind! So they may have to write! so I asked... I doubt if he is also studying psychology? Sit comfortably! Take this! Hold the guitar! Guitar is invented for the sake of girls! These curves are made for your contours! This curve is for your chest! Where do I keep the fingers? To start with hold the guitar closely like this! Better to use the fingers! Let this go! Just close your eyes... ...and the fingers should touch like this ...just feel the music! When Sanju was teaching me guitar I just lost myself 'I myself don't know what was I feeling then!' In whatever way I look at I am more beautiful than her! Then why didn't he teach me guitar? Why should he teach only her? Gomathy! The guitar sits on you but where are you seated now? Master! He gave his guitar to you only to embrace you like this! - He is teaching me! - Is this the way to teach? Your fashion and taste has changed! You forgot your tradition... ...you have even changed the instrument fiddle! If you stay with him one second more... ...along with classical music you would also lose your life! My God! What is this? Have you torn it? Have you torn her entirely? You fellow, you have torn her! How can I assuage your dad? My God! Come here, come girl! Dotty! You are going overboard! Am I going overboard? Do you know who I am? Fiddle Brahmma! Brahmma the fiddle! If you are fiddle Brahmma I am Sanju, Sanju Rengan! Oh God! Each one of them think they are all greats! I will show you who I am! I will show all of you Show me! Hello! Stop master! Sir! I can't handle this pressure! What happened man? Your daughter has gone out of your control! Shankarabaranam Sagara sangamam... ...have all gone in vain! Considering your health condition... I am not telling you about the broken fiddle now! Is the fiddle broken? How? Here is a guy called Sanju! He laid his hands on the fiddle! Praise Lord Shiva! Now he has laid his hands on your daughter! - Praise Lord Shiva! - Who is he? What is his background? His background is guitar! Our background is fiddle! Western music has hit at our classical music Our classical music was smashed! Oh God! I don't think I can do anything sir! Have you heard what your daughter has done? She has broken my fiddle and our traditions too! How will I answer my grandpa? You can answer him when you go there! Now ask about her! Our daughter says 'Praise Lord Shiva'! You never understand head or tail of anything! He is harried because he is a bachelor! Why should you believe him? Is the mom chiding the daughter? He says this because of his concern for our daughter! Dammit! He is an eccentric person! Have you forgotten what all he did? Thanjavur Kutttappa Vaithyanatha Bagavathar... ...gifted you a fiddle! Did he not steal and run away with that fiddle? Give the phone to me! I would talk to that chump! - Brother! Are you fine? - I don't want reverence! Girls character reflects how she was brought up by mom! Your daughter has lost the fiddle! Now she can play guitar! I will give the phone to your daughter! Talk whatever you want! Talk dear! Who is that boy dear? He is Sanju He is a good boy mom! If he is such a good boy what is the issue? What is he doing there? He is a famous guitar player here! What! Is he a famous guitar player? He plays in streets Do you call this famous? You may also go and applaud him! Don't mind him! Tell me his address! Dad would go and inquire everything! Go to the boy's house and talk to them What should I talk? What if you talk? Will you not talk to them? I ask, will you not talk to them? What to do? All aged men at the hands of his wife is a... Have you gone mad? Sitting alone, to whom are you talking? - Come! - No, Sanju! - I say come here! - No, Sanju! You just keep quiet! You said it would come when you press it - It is quite some time now - It would come! Sanju! They are caste conscious It would create issues! - Hi - Hi everybody! Hi Gomathy! I am Sanju's dad She is my wife Sumathy! - Hi darling! - Greet you! PKV sir! That handsome boy is my son Sanju! - Greet you uncle! - I have understood! This great guy has smashed our family fiddle! Why should you talk about that now? Please stay quiet! Me and PKV sir discussed about everything! Your wish is our wish! We have accepted your love! We don't have any reservations on this! But we do have... Tell them! Nothing very big! Our daughter is a vegan! Your son eats meats and fishes... So if my daughter is asked to cook them... Occasionally he does that... Not daily, only on Sundays... - On Sundays go out and dine! - Ok, dad! That is not a problem! Because it is an inter caste marriage... ...there is no question of me giving any dowry! Come on! That is already explained Let the boy also know about it! In case he demands it later? One more thing! You are from Kannoor! Don't keep bomb or explosives at home In case my daughter handles them unknowingly... ...that would spell the doom! She is our only daughter! If something happens it's all gone! Hear me sir! Some incidents might have happened in this country! All of us are well educated and very disciplined! I am an MBA graduate! He is a doctor and my son has a BTech degree! Whatever you say... ...there will always be problems in inter caste marriages! Mr. PKV sir! Forget for a moment the olden days! Just think about the new times! What is the progress? Times have changed! Now your girl is a brahmin! But my Nair son marries her! Likewise even Nair girls are married by other caste boys! A brahmin girl living close by was married by a Muslim boy! Now they have two kids and lead a happy life! What a happiest progress! What is wrong? Wherever you check... ...these days people marry among different castes! If you take that in to account why should we have caste feelings Children are leading a happy life That is what we want! Ok, I agree! Afinal thing... I am playing fiddle for 40 years! I've become old too! Since you are in ruling party... ...if you can influence someone and get me a Padmashree award ...I can have a happy end to my life! You can't get Padmashree like that! Don't worry! I will try my best! - Think it is done! - That is Nair! Give your hand! "My dear seducer My passionate lover!" "Delightful, handsome canny love-torn guy!" "Would give you pleasure today!" "Girl, given you a lightning flowery kiss on lips!" "Now I would acquire the entire world!" "You are a romantic ornate platter!" "From now on it's blooming season always!" "Come sliding in this dreamy chariot!" "Every day every night every wrong every right!" "With your plumy fingers dish out honey!" "Propitious, bonny soft cherubic lovely guy!" "When you hug me joy fills me!" "I am near you for you to realise your dreams!" "Gilded, moon like, gentle gives refuge, exudes valour!"
