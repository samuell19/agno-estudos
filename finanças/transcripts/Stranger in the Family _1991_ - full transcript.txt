[NARRATOR READING OUT] [SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [UNINTELLIGIBLE POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [SIREN BLARING] Steve, Steve! Oh, God, Steve. Steve... MAN: You’re the mother? Yes. Oh, Steve. Steve, I was so scared. What’s the matter with him? Why isn’t he answering me? He’s probably in shock. Here, give me a hand. We’ll get him outta here. You sure it’s all right to move him? We’ll get you out of here, fella. Yell if anything hurts. CRAIG: The car just came out of nowhere. It slammed right into us. RANDI: Are you all right? Okay. Are you all right? I just... It all happened so quick. Did somebody call your mom? We were at the stop sign and... RANDI: Are you okay? CRAIG: Yeah, I guess. I mean, it was over so quick. What the hell happened? The kids were rear-ended by that vehicle. Probably a DUI. Extremities are responsive. He’s got a small bump at the back of his head. No other sign of injury. Well, I want a doctor to see him. All right. We have to take the other driver It’ll be about 15 minutes before another ambulance can get here. Why? She was the one that hit him. MAN: Doesn’t matter. Sorry, ma’am. You’ll have to wait. Let’s take him ourselves. RANDI: Come on, honey. You’re leaving with Mom and Dad. Here we go. Okay. Here we go. Careful. [UNINTELLIGIBLE POLICE RADIO CHATTER] RANDI: What the hell is keeping that doctor? I mean, he needs an X-ray, and a blood test, and an EKG, and an EEG, and the whole damn alphabet. When are they gonna give us the result? When are we gonna get something done for him? The doctor should be here soon. Are you crazy? You think I’m gonna let him sit here for an hour? If that doctor’s not here in ten minutes, I’m gonna go after him. Well, my mom’s here. I guess I better go. Well, we’re not quite through here yet. Yeah, well, I hope Steve’s gonna be okay. ALAN: He’ll be fine. You look great, Craigy. Regular party guy. CRAIG: I’ll call tomorrow. Sorry this took so long. Halloween. Nurse, what’s his blood pressure? NURSE: 110/62. DOCTOR: It’s a little low. Normal for a mild shock. He hasn’t said anything since the accident. MAN: We need a nurse over here. All right. Let’s check his eyes. [MACHINE BEEPING] Normal. Normal? [SCOFFS] He can’t talk, he doesn’t recognize his own parents, he can’t walk, you call that normal? Your son has a mild concussion. A minor edema at the back of the head. It’d probably need a couple of days. Edema? What is that? Slight cerebral swelling from the bump on the head. It accounts for his lack of responsiveness. Keep him in bed for 24 hours, check up on him periodically throughout the night, if he has trouble breathing, begins vomiting, bring him back in right away. He’ll have a headache tomorrow. Just give him acetaminophen. What is that? Any kind of non-aspirin. Mrs., uh, Thompson, your son has concussive syndrome. It’ll clear up in a couple of days. But doctor, he doesn’t even know where he is. I’ve examined him. He’ll be all right. Here we go. That’s better. Let’s just get you to your room. We’re home now, honey. We’ll put you to bed, all right? [RANDI GRUNTS] ALAN: Come on, Steve, just get over it. [STEVE GASPING] What is it? We’re gonna put you to bed. Come on, son, just down the hall. RANDI: What should we do? [PANTING] What is it, Steve? We’ll let him sleep on the couch. I’ll make the sofa bed up for you, okay? Would you like that? All right. You’ll sleep on the couch. ALAN: Let’s just get him in this chair here. RANDI: Okay. ALAN: Come on, get the bed up. RANDI: Watch his head, watch his head. Okay. RANDI We’re home, honey, okay? All right. All right. Let’s go to bed. RANDI: Steve, come on. ALAN: Come on. RANDI: Here we go. ALAN: Here we go. RANDI: Here we go. In you go. Watch out for his head. I got it. Okay. Here you go. Okay. Here. Now you just rest. Why don’t you get his clothes off? I’ll go check on Shari. Did you see the way he looked down the hall? Yeah. I tried to give him some water but he wouldn’t swallow. He’s falling asleep. Come on. I just wanna stay here for a little while. We’ll take turns checking on him. He’ll be fine. I’ll be up in a while. He’s gonna be fine. He’s our tough guy. [WHISPERS] He’s our tough guy. Bet the party’s still going on. Come on, Steve, get up. Gotta drive me to dance. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Steve, I’m gonna be late. Time for morning magic. Watch Stefano The Great get out of this one. Ha-ha. Are you okay? Sorry. You’re scaring me. My God. Mom? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Mom! Something’s wrong with Steve. I think he peed in his bed. Steve? Steve? What’s the matter, son? What’s wrong with him? Let’s sit him up, honey. ALAN: I checked on him at 6:00. What’s the matter with him? ALAN: He was in a car accident last night. It’s all right, Steve. It’s just Dad. It's Dad. It’s okay. It’s okay. [SHUSHING] It’s okay. I’m calling a doctor. [WHIRRING] DOCTOR: Scan shows some soft tissues swelling on the right side of the parietal region. There’s also a very thin rim of what appears to be fluid density on the right side of the lateral temporal region. ALAN: Excuse me, doctor, you lost us. DOCTOR: I’m sorry. Steve has a small accumulation of fluid on the side. That would account for his headaches. His blood vessels are all intact. His cranial nerves are normal. Why is he acting this way? Why doesn’t he know who we are? Why doesn’t he speak? Mrs. Thompson, I can’t find anything physically wrong with him that would prevent him from speaking. The problem might be psychological. There’s not been any psychological issue. I mean, he was fine before the accident. I would suggest that we admit him for observation. Well, there’s no point in both of us staying here. Okay. I’ll knock off for a little, pick up Shari at school. Call me. Okay. He’ll be all right. Don’t worry. Temporary global amnesia. Amnesia? It’s common part of post-concussive syndrome. Most patients... I thought you said it was shock. We can only go on the basis of the information that we have at hand. In this situation, most patients will regain their memory in a course of a few weeks. ALAN: A few weeks? What are we supposed to do in the meantime? For the time being, you have to teach him the basic skills that he’s forgotten. Simple things like brushing his teeth, finding his way around the house, going to the bathroom... Speaking? Speaking. Vocabulary. Just like a baby. Pretty much. Yeah. I’m sorry, doctor, but what you’re saying is very disturbing. I mean... Why are you so matter of fact about it? You act as if he’s gonna get over a cold or something. I’m sympathetic to how you feel, Mrs. Thompson. But nothing to be gained by emotionalizing the issue. I’m not emotionalizing, I just want to know what the hell’s going on with my son. I’d like to know if there’s anything I can do to help him. Amnesia is almost always short-term. Is there a treatment that we can do? Some kind of drug? Give him lots of stimulus. Read to him, play with him, expose him to activities and people. It’ll be slow at first. You’ll have your son back sooner than you expect. [SIGHS] Mom, where’s breakfast? I have to go to school. Since when do you want breakfast? Since all the time. I’ll go grab something. Wait. What do you want? I’ll get you something. It’s okay. I gotta go. Shari, would you check on Steve? Mom, I’m gonna be late. Please? Can’t even get to school around here. Hi. Hi. Oh, um, Mom wants you for breakfast. Breakfast. What shirt do you want? Put your arms up. [SIGHS] Come on. Gotta go. Bye. [DOOR CLOSES] Steve? Way to go, Shari. Guess you forgot your pants, huh? Sit down over here. Sit right here, honey. So, what would you like for breakfast? Eggs? Eggs? Eggs... Eggs. Eggs. Scrambled eggs. Eggs. We have a long way to go. Hey, you can’ts make a jackass out of me. [STEVE LAUGHING] And now I will hypnotize a charming... [RANDI GRUNTING] I don’t know why I saved all these stuff for. [GRUNTS] This would be out of date for everybody’s grandchildren. [HUMMING] Hello. Hi. Hi, I’m Wily the Wizard. Hi, Steve. Hi, Randi. Hi, how are you? I am Wily the Wizard, and I’m going to make Stefano The Great reappear! Abracadabra and shazam! [STEVE GIGGLING] Where’s Stefano The Great? Stefano The Great? Well, so much for magic. What do we have? Runaway Bunny... Dr. Seuss. You like Dr. Seuss. [HONKING] What is that? Hey, you wanna help me? Pop-up book. Wanna help me, Steve? They’re books. Open them. Mm-hmm. Show me one you like. Baseball... They’re books. Steve, they’re books. Books are for reading, Steve. Steve... Steve. See, and now... No. Brush your own teeth. Look. Good. Mm. Hurts. You brush your teeth, not your lips, genius. RANDI: Can you say, "tall"? STEVE: Tall. Mm-hmm. That’s right. That’s the word. Tall. T-A-L-L. Tall. And what is that word? You learned that a minute ago. A. That’s right. That’s right. That's it. And next comes the number seven. Seven. STEVE: Seven. Seven. Seven. So it’s... BOTH: Six. And? Seven. Seven. Very good. That’s okay. You can get another one, just pull the thing. Okay? And the ball comes back. Okay. Go. Go. Come on. Turn it around. Turn it around. Come on. Oh, right, yeah, Steve! Yeah! Good. Good. Good. You know pinball all right. You are good! Yes! Good! So this punk doesn’t even know if she has insurance? She’s charged with drunk driving for God’s sake. She rear-ended him. Yeah. How about a nice charge of criminal negligence? I... So what you’re saying to me is that we have a woman who has caused a lot of grief, but we can’t do anything about it because she’s irresponsible? Yeah. Okay. SHARI: It’s Mom's not-too-spicy chicken strips. STEVE: Chicken strips. Cheese. STEVE: Cheese. SHARI: Tomatoes. STEVE: Tomatoes. SHARI: Stay away from Dad’s hot sauce. STEVE: Hot sauce. We got a problem with the woman who hit him. Some insurance thing. She should be in jail. If it wasn’t for her, we wouldn’t be doing any of this. We have to think about money. If he needs special therapy... He’s not gonna need special therapy. Hmm. Bathroom. Mirror. Gum ball. Organ. [PRESSES KEYS] SHARI: Hey, Steve, want some breakfast? Shari. My sister. SHARI: Steve. My brother. Paintings. TV. [BELL JINGLES] [SPLASHES] SHARI: Steve! Mom! Dad! Steve’s in the pool! Steve! Steve! Steve! [COUGHING] Are you okay? Can you breathe? Come here. [COUGHING] Are you okay? Are you all right, Steve? Huh? Water. [STEVE COUGHING] Water. Water. ALAN: What if you had to pull him out yourself? Shari couldn’t do it. He’s a strong kid. He could’ve drowned you. He wouldn’t do that. Honey, he doesn’t know. It’s not Steve. He’s a 140-pound baby going through the terrible twos. Well, we can’t lock him in his room. So what do we do? We can’t child-proof the house against a 16-year-old. This red button right here turns it on and off. And these arrows go up and down, you can change the channel back and forth. Here, you try it. You have to turn it on first. No, just let me see. Stop it! Don’t. You're gonna break it! Break it. Don’t. Give it to me. Don’t. Let me see it! Stop it. Don’t. Break it. Break it. Don’t! [CLANGING] Break it. Break it! Break it! What’s going on? What are you doing to him? I didn’t do anything to him, I was just trying to teach him. He doesn’t understand anything. Stop, stop, stop. Give me this. Give it to me. Give it to Mommy. Give it. You always take his side. Stop it. Just stop it. Just calm down. Slow down. Come on. Take a deep breath. [SIGHS] Take a deep breath. It’s okay. It's okay. It’s okay. See, everything’s all right. Hi, Mrs. Thompson, we thought we’d come by and see how Steve is doing. Shari said he was coming along... Well, yes, yes, he is... I... He’s just doing some, um, exercises the doctor told him to do. Like running and shouting, you know, like football. Build him up... So, he’s busy. Well, here’s some cookies I... Aw. ...made them myself. Well, is he around? We’d just like to say hi. Well, I really don’t think he’s ready yet. He's just... He’s not a hundred percent, you know. We heard he had like brain damage or something. Yeah, some kids say he’s paralyzed. No, no, no, he has amnesia. He doesn’t really remember anything from before the accident. Nothing? You mean like he won’t remember us? No, he will. It’s just temporary. He’ll remember you later. Well, um, tell him that we came by and we miss him. That’s very sweet of you kids. Okay, bye. Bye. Thanks for the cookies. You’re welcome. Bye, kids. Be careful. Amnesia? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, Craigy. How’re you doing? Pretty bad, about Steve, you know. Do you wanna come in? I thought you said that... [CAR ENGINE STARTING] Oh, well, it’s okay if it’s just you, I guess it’ll be all right. But don’t be surprised if he doesn’t remember who you are. Steve? Guess who’s here. Steve, look, it’s Craig. You were on the cycling team together. What’s up, bro? RANDI: It’s okay, Steve. Craig is your friend. Maybe I better go. I mean, I gotta be at school anyway. I’m real sorry, man. You take care. I’ll tell you when he gets better, Craig. I didn’t do anything. No one’s blaming you, Craig. My mom said you’re probably mad at me because it happened to Steve and... nothing happened to me. RANDI: No. I’ll call you when he’s better, okay? Okay? Yeah. That’s cool. [INDISTINCT TV CHATTER] Oh! Pull up your head. Pull up your head. [STEVE COUGHING] Okay. Good. SHARI: His nickname is Macaroon? [LAUGHS] Oh, my God, I didn’t know he was born in Philadelphia. Cool. Oh, my God! His fav... Oh, my God, his favorite colors are blue, silver, white, green, and black. And this guy is gross. Why is he in here? He has so many zits. They could at least cover him up or something. You’re lucky you don't have any zits. You have lots of possibilities. We could do something different with your hair and your clothes. Hmm. Maybe we could do your hair like that. I can’t help but thinking, if he does have amnesia, what’s his capacity for learning? I don’t mind sending a teacher, but if he’s not receptive... Oh, believe me, if you send a good teacher, he will learn. I promise you. Oh, Mrs. Thompson, even three weeks is a long time to wait, especially in a junior year. Maybe... if, after he recovers, we just have him repeat the year. Look, you’re missing the point. I just don’t want him to fall behind. I want him to graduate with his class. We... We’ll check with the doctor and if she supports your request, we’ll approve it. [YELLING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [YELLING] [DOORBELL RINGING] Hi, Mrs. Thompson, I’m Ellie Kessler, the homebound teacher. Oh, hi, come in. Thanks. I’m glad you're here. [STEVE REWINDING THE TAPE] He watches a lot of television? Actually, those are home movies. You know, himself and the family before the accident. But he knows what he’s watching? Yeah. The doctor told me to expose him to as many familiar things as I could, to trigger his memory. But he does understand that’s him? Yeah, I explained it to him. He knows that that’s Steve and he’s Steve. Hi, Steve. Steve, this is Mrs. Kessler. She’s gonna help you learn some things. It’s okay. Mrs. Kessler’s a friend. So, Steve... do you wanna study? Good. Turn off the television set, and let’s get started. Go ahead. You can do it. You know how. Television off. RANDI: Mm. So I guess, you can work right here, okay? MRS. KESSLER: Great. So, Steve, do you know your numbers? He can count to 30, and, um, we’ve learned some reading, and, um... I guess it would be easier if I wasn’t here, right? Usually is. Right. Well, I’ll be right in here if you need me. Great. You like cars? MRS. KESSLER: Great. Okay, now, let’s see. These two are totaled. Totaled. How many are left? [LAUGHS] That’s very good. All right. Start over. STEVE: A... mouse... [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] MRS. KESSLER: Whoop. Over here. "I... "would... would..." No, the L is silent. Anywhere. Anywhere. Good. "’John,' Jenny said, Mister... "Mister... Ra..." MRS. KESSLER: It’s a funny one. Try it. "Rai..." Rai... Rai..." MRS. KESSLER: Yeah, really slowly together... All right, what about... six cars... and six cars. How many do you think that would equal? Eleven, and... one more. Very good. STEVE: "’Oh, no,' "Jenny said quickly, ’I... "did not say that to your recep...’" I don't know... Sh... that’s a "sh" sound. "Receptionist." Good. Good. Okay. Let’s do another one. Really? You think that’s possible? Oh, yes. We all work with him, we’ll help him to function, and... in fact, Mrs. Kessler said she’s never worked with anyone that’s progressed so quickly. I suppose what we’ll do then is we’ll test him, you know, for re-admittance. I don’t know if he's ready to come back to school yet. I’m sorry, I thought you just said that... I want him to graduate with his class. I just want him to be able to make up the work that he lost after he gets his memory back. [BELL DINGING] All right. You... You understand that the homebound teachers are supplied by the District and we have nothing to do with that. And also, I believe that Mrs. Kessler is... is assigned to the case on interim basis. What does that mean? It’s just... the District expects to make some disposition on this after she’s finished. [EXHALES] Really? I can’t believe this. When is this? Uh, according to the file, next week. Wanna give it a try? Give it a try? Yeah. Yeah. Start with Shari’s bike. It’s a little smaller. You can use it to get started. Here. Climb on. Climb on? Yeah. I’ll guide you, just... just bring your leg over. Just bring your leg over. That’s right. That’s right. Okay. Oh... Sit on the seat. Try sit on the seat. Oh... okay. Good. Good. Just bring your leg through. STEVE: Bring my leg through. ALAN: Just bring this leg right through. Okay. Okay. Just put your hands right here. STEVE: Hands here. ALAN: Good. ALAN: It’s all right. STEVE: Here. ALAN: How does that feel? Steve, bike-rider on TV. [ALAN LAUGHS] Yeah. That’s right. Okay. It’s all right. Don’t be scared. I got you. Real slow. Okay? Don’t be scared. Don’t be scared. I got you. Okay. Good. Okay. All right. All right. How’s that feel, huh? Hey, look at us! Hey! Yeah. Way to go, Steve. They’re cutting Mrs. Kessler. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] Hey. Hey, hey. [PANTS] Come here. [PANTING] Nothing ever goes right, does it? You feel like you’re floating around on top of everything, and then some bureaucrat, some damn drunk... You’re not a quitter. I know, but sometimes I wish I were. Don’t you think I'm scared that this whole thing isn’t gonna work, that this is just... he’s not... [SOBS] [CRIES] What am I gonna do? RANDI: All right, Steve. I’ll be right outside. I’m not going anywhere. Mom is gonna leave her purse. See, I’ll be just sitting right outside. See? There’s the car keys, and the car won’t go anyplace without the keys. I won’t leave until I come and get them from Steve, okay? Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. Okay, Steve. Ready to get started? In reading, his standard score was 48. That’s in the fifth percentile of his class. It means his reading level is below the third grade. Spelling, 54. Second percentile. Arithmetic, 46. Third percentile. He’s doing very well with numbers. Mrs. Kessler said he’s doing some fifth grade work. My conclusion is this. Steve is in no way ready to return to class. Oh, yes, that’s my point. I think Mrs. Kessler should stay. He needs homebound teaching. The District is... there’s an incredible demand for homebound teaching. Well, I think Steve deserves special consideration. I mean, he’s going through hell. Of course, I... everyone feels that their own situation is somehow unique. Look, I don’t get this. You act as if it’s his fault. He didn’t do anything wrong. We have Dr. Banks’ reports stating that it would be therapeutically good for Steve to be... Dr. Banks gave a report? Uh, maybe we can just cut right through this. Uh, we all agree that Steve should not be thrown back into a regular classroom situation. It’s my recommendation that Steve be... admitted into a special education class. But isn’t that for retarded... Actually, it’s a much broader category. It... it gives each student an opportunity... My son has amnesia. He’s not physically handicapped, he’s not retarded. He... he just can’t remember things right now, but he will. Your son has dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia. Um... it’s a very difficult case. My son is not a "case." I don’t... I don't think you should just ignore him. Doesn’t the law say you owe him an education? We can’t, and don't want to deny him education, but we have to set some limits. Please, it’s just a matter of time before he’s back to normal. In the meantime, I don’t think he should be treated like a freak, or... or just parked some place because he’s inconvenient. I... I don’t want you to leave him behind. He needs to graduate with his class. [BELL DINGING] Steve. Hey, you look great. Hey, Steve. Hey, my main man, what’s up? Damn. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] He doesn’t remember? What’s wrong with him? Hey, hey, Steve. It’s okay, man, it's cool. GIRL: Guys, just get away from him. Mrs. Thompson. We tried to get him out of here. He’s not okay. It’s okay, honey. Mommy’s here. He’s not better yet, is he? He’s, um, he's all right. Well, he doesn’t look too good. [BELL DINGING] STEVE: Shari? What? Let’s play. [PINBALL CLATTERING] Let’s play, Shari. I don’t feel like it. [PINBALL CLATTERING] Teach me. God... [PINBALL CLATTERING] [TV BLARING] Let’s take a walk. Shari... Go away. Let’s do flash cards. [SWITCHES OFF TV] No, Steve, or whoever you are. You made a fool of me today, you know that? Of course, you don’t know that. You don’t know anything. You know what kids call me at school? "Frankenstein’s sister." "Weird Thompson." How would you like that? You’d like that just fine. You don’t know what anything means, anyway. Are you mad at me? If you stay this way... I look at you and you’re not there. I need Steve. You used to teach me. Sometimes I look at you and I forget, and I almost expect you to smile at me... say "Shari... you’re okay." I need you to say that I’m okay. [BREATHES DEEPLY] STEVE: I need to read. No, read. I will read to you. No. No, no, no! No. RANDI: I will read to you. STEVE: I need to read. Steve! Sit down. Now. Now, your mother will bring you a book. Maybe that ocean book that you like. [SIGHS] MRS. KESSLER: Steve... You’ll be able to learn. You don’t need me. Anyone can help you. You’ll do it yourself. Now, I want you to help me pack up my things while I go into the kitchen and talk to your mom, okay? Steve’s just getting that I can’t control him. He can go out now and there’s so much that he wants to learn, and I just can’t keep up with him. I mean, you could manage him so much better. You know, it’s none of my business, but... I think if I were you, I’d consider an alternative. What do you mean? The doctor said it was just gonna be a matter of weeks before he got his memory back. I mean, all this is just to stimulate. Everybody knows that. If I thought he was gonna stay this way for the rest of his life... [SIGHS] Um... I better get going. Thank you, Steve. You are a wonderful boy. I’m gonna miss you. You’re going? Go goodbye? Yep. You’ll go goodbye, Mrs. Kessler? He’s great. You’re very lucky. Well, we have, kind of a complicated situation here. I’ve been through all the reports, tests, medical and educational stuff, and I can see how somebody could come to the conclusion that doctors are a pretty unreliable source of information. Is he gonna get his memory back? No. I don’t believe you. I don’t blame you. I wouldn’t want to believe it either. How do you know? I can give you a whole lot of medical gobbledygook to explain it, but... Look, don’t jerk me around. I’ll decide what is gobbledygook and what isn’t. All right? Um, I didn’t mean to be patronizing, uh, it’s... just... not a lot of fun for me either. The course of the accident caused tearing to deep parts of the brain. These micro tears are undetectable, except by inferring their existence from the patient’s behavior. That’s why Dr. Banks could be so sure his memory would return. She saw no evidence of permanent brain damage, and I’m afraid she... led probably, you, mistook new learning for signs for Steve’s memory coming back. Everything was affected by the accident. Everything. His experience, um, what we think of as memory, his personality, um, the style of his thinking, all those almost infinite number of building blocks, from... from when you first held him when he was a crying baby, to... the times you grounded him for getting out of line. [SIGHS] All that’s gone. You mean his whole life is just gone? The information is still there. He, um... just will never be able to reach it. He has severe retrograde amnesia, and, uh... it’s permanent. That’s it? I’m sorry? I mean, that’s all you have to tell us? Your opinion. No, no. I have... I have a lot to tell you if... if you’re interested. But, um... you’re gonna have to become parents all over again. Thank you very much, doctor. ALAN: I would like to call you. There are places I can recommend. I will not have my son institutionalized. Come on, honey, let’s go. Bye, Amy. Bye, Steve. Steve. [EXHALES] Do you know who these people are? My mom. My dad. How do you know that? They told me. Do you know what moms and dads are? Yeah. They... They give me stuff... buy toys. Mm-hmm. Do you love them? Do you know what love is? Uh-uh. That doesn’t prove anything. You haven’t proved anything. The only thing you proved is that he hasn’t got his memory back yet. I will not accept the fact that he will not remember his own mother. What I am to him, or what he is to me... You haven’t proved anything except that... you’re just like everybody else. Except you’re more cruel. Come on. I’m sorry. RANDI: GO ahead. Touch the binding. Remember how many times you used to adjust the release? Honey, try to remember. They always broke open on the cutback run. Here. Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. Think about the snow. Cold snow. Think about it. Remember? Snow? [SCOFFS] Right, Randi. You don’t even know what snow is anymore, do you? Hmm. [SIGHS] Eighth grade, tennis. Fifth grade, AYSO Soccer. Third place. Not a very good team, do you remember? And there was Indian Guides, and... Best Trailblazer... [SIGHS] Cycling awards... You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you? Maybe... maybe... if you look around this room, I know you look at all this stuff. It must seem like... I don’t know what this must seem like to you. But maybe... if you... try to... to feel it, and not think about it. Understand? To feel it? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ALAN: Don’t open a thing yet. Let me get in position here. RANDI: If you don’t believe in Santa Claus, you can’t open these. So you believe? SHARI: Yeah. And you too, right? STEVE: Yeah. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [LAUGHTER] RANDI: Okay, let’s see. So, this is for Shari. This one’s for Steve. Okay. Oh, candy, from you, Alan. I got one, too. SHARI: Yes! RANDI: I knew it. RANDI: That was the year you got the Mercedes toy car. Yes! You were gonna open that right here. That’s it. See this? SHARI: I love it. You must remember that toy, you slept with it for a year. RANDI: For Dad. Dad’s incredible Christmas waffles, one time only. Get them while they’re hot. Oh, Daddy makes the best waffles in the world. Get them while they’re hot. RANDI: Yeah, that’s the F16. Yeah, you got the Corvette, and the go in, that year. Remember? Corvette, you called it the "Vette." That’s what you wanted to call it. Vette. It’s okay, honey. It’s getting cold. [CHATTER ON TV] Honey, this is beautiful. Look what Dad got me. This is beautiful. ALAN: You try it on yet? Ta da! Aha, there’s my magic assistant, Craig, who just flew in from the Middle East. [WITH AN ACCENT] Oh, my goodness, it is a great honor to be here. Say, "Wow." Wow. Oh, my goodness. That’s you, honey, that's you. Shari, the pizza is getting old here. Wait a minute, I think this was alive. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] A chicken. Not just with your magic tricks, but... you know, situations. [YELLING] Chicken? I’m fighting for my life. What kind of hold is this? I don’t know, but it’s working. That’s Steve. Don’t watch TV. Steve, I want you to look at this. Right, Daddy. Come on, Pa. See, Daddy? No! No, please, no. Not back in the pool! No. [YELLING] Honey, I’ve got the dishes to do, I’ve got stuff to do. You want me to play with him for a while? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Call it Randi’s original. [YELLING AND CHEERING] I want you to pay attention to this, Steve. That’s a fact, Jack. I mean, life is not... a perfect world, I mean, they look at me, and look at other people. I am beautiful. Get up and look at this. [SIGHS] [TAPE REWINDING] Steve. [GIRL SCREAMING] Steve, you’re all wet. You’re so bad, pushing people in the pool. What a charming host you turned out to be. Mm. I love you anyway. [YELLING AND LAUGHING] [GIRL] I’m getting you, Steve! Do you wanna get better? Steve? Stop it. Stop it! We have to work. GIRL: Can I get you a towel? Please don’t go in the pool anymore. Steve. This one. To, uh, cross country. This one. Junior Swim Team. Mm... This one. Um, I... Young Magician, first place. This. Coat for sports? Letterman jacket. Junior varsity. STEVE: Steve. Craig. Shari. Steve. My... My mother. My father. Shari. Shari, Steve, my mother, my fa... Your father. Your family, your family. My family... Okay. Craig. Yeah. Grandma. Yeah. Dad and Shari. Steve. What? Um... My mother. Um... My father. S... Steve. Shari with my mother? No, no. That’s me. Me with my mother when I was little. I, uh... Okay. Keep going. Dad. No. That’s... Shari? Yes. Um, Steve. Yeah. Shari. Yeah. Dad? Yeah. My mother. Yeah. Um... Dad? Little Steve. Little Steve. Steve. Shari. My mother. My... My sister baby? No, Steve when he was a baby. That’s Steve, that's Steve, that’s Steve, that's Steve! Pay attention to this! I... there was just... Steve. Steve. Um... My mother. Steve. Steve and Craig. Steve. Steve. [STEVE WHIMPERING] Steve. Steve. Who’s this? Who's this? It’s Steve, it's Steve. That is Steve. That is Steve. You understand? Steve. Your father. My father. Yes. Uh... Your mother and your father. Your mother and your father! Craig and Steve. Randi. The whole family. I... Family... Who’s this? Who's this? Steve. I can’t... Randi. Steve! [BANGING] RANDI: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! Steve! Steve, come here. Oh, no. [SOBS] Like the accident, If I hit my head, I can be old Steve. Everybody wants old Steve. RANDI: Oh. [SOBBING] I need old Steve. [CRIES] [SOBS] [SIGHS] ALAN: Randi, you’re starting to scare me. Honey, we’ve got to work this out. It’s not just Steve. Shari’s starting to behave like... Randi? [TAP RUNNING] Randi, open the door, please. [RANDI CRYING] Randi? Randi, open the... [RANDI SCREAMING] Randi, open the door, please. Randi! Open the damn door! [RANDI SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [CRYING] MAN: You don’t want your life... You don’t care about your children. My folks were migrant laborers. Not field workers, day workers. Garages, factories... I pretty much raised myself. I just didn’t want that. You need her to be a perfect wife and mother. I never said that. I never made her feel that. You said she was adopted. Yes. MAN: She’s trying to create the perfect family, to make up for the one that she never had. Neither of you ever had. No problem. [TV BLARING] We already talked about it. Pete says you guys are behaving yourselves. Kate said she’d feed you, and one of them will stay over at the house if you want. Yeah. Hey, you were the first latchkey kid, right? He’ll be fine. Yeah. Bye. My mom needs my dad, my brother needs my mom, my dad doesn’t need anything. Want a soda? [PINBALL RATTLING] Did you ever notice how noisy kids are? [SIGHS] Lately the house is so loud. MAN: Would you rather not have children? How can you say that to me? MAN: You’re having a hard time being a mother. [SCOFFS] What do you expect? My son was in an accident. He lost his memory. For the last four months, I’ve been trying to... [EXHALES] To... He doesn’t remember. What? Anything. Me. He doesn’t remember me. Everything. All the, um... seventeen years... from the instant he came out of me. It’s gone. Can you love him? RANDI: I don’t know. If he isn’t really yours. It’s not the same as being adopted, you know. Isn’t it? I worked all my life... To make sure your children made up for your childhood? This is different. You make it sound like it’s the same thing, this it’s not the same thing. I gave everything I had to my children. My life... One of them doesn’t remember that anymore. [PINBALL RATTLING] [DINGING] Steve, what are you doing? You’re gonna break it. You broke pinball! Calm down. I just made it so you wouldn’t break it. You don’t break it, I break... Why don’t you break it? God, I just unplugged it. What’s the matter with you? Everybody’s always m... mad at me. Nobody’s mad at you. Everybody’s always mad at me. Teach me. What? Teach me the... the... the... the feel. I need it. I... I need the... the... the feel. To feel, you feel like, sad, or happy. Teach me. I can’t. Why? I don’t know. You just do it. It just happens to you. Why? Why? It’s all my fault. How can it be your fault? All my fault! She said... she said I should feel a snow. Feel the... The old Steve could feel the snow. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Salt water taffy. I think this thing goes with your outfit. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] GIRL: Have you been on the boat ride yet? Come on, let’s go. Let's go. Stop it. What are you doing? My God. Sick! Oh, God. [RATTLING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BALLOON BURSTS] [BELL DINGS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SQUEALS] [SQUEALS] [SQUEALS] [SQUEALS] When? Did you look? How could you do that? Take him to the boardwalk? [SOBS] It’s not my fault. I can’t keep track of him. He’s too big. All you care about is him. Let me talk to Pete. I don’t think it's my fault. Alan? Yes. Did you call the police? I’ll be home as soon as possible. I don’t know about Randi. We’ll take care of everything. I can’t just disappear, I have to tell her I’m leaving. The question is the effect on her at this stage of the treatment. When I make a decision, I usually base it on two things. What can the patient accomplish, and what is the effect likely to be on the patient’s condition. And in Randi’s situation, I honestly don’t know the answer. The receptionist said there was an emergency call from home. Steve is missing. What do you mean, missing? How could he be missing? I don’t know. I have to go home and find out. I’ll be ready in 15 minutes. What was this little meeting? To decide if you’re gonna break it to me gently? Were you even gonna tell me at all? [SCOFFS] You guys must be more nuts than I am. [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] BOY: Hey. Come on over. To the warm. It’s okay. Come here. It’s okay. Everybody, this is Steve. BOY: How’re you doing? GIRL: Hey. Sit down. POLICEMAN: That’s the number of recorded runaways. This covers the entire country. This could take forever. I don’t think you understand. Our son has amnesia. He just wandered off. He’s not a runaway. You folks were out of town? You know the state of mind your kid was in? Sometimes that can make a difference. A lot of times, parents don’t even know what their kid are thinking about. Sometimes it’s hard to keep track of what things are going on, huh? [PHONE RINGING] Parents suck. [CHUCKLES] It’s the truth. You can go home if you want, or you can stay here with us. Whatever. I don’t wanna go home. Who needs it? Who needs it? [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] What if he did run away? Then we’d deal with that. What if I drove him away? Steve... or whoever it is in Steve’s body. Hour after hour... [SIGHS] Trying to make him remember things. You know... in the end... I actually didn’t care if he remembered or not. Just if he pretended to be Steve. I’m not gonna let you do this to yourself. And how in the hell are you gonna stop me? I lie in that bed and that tape starts running. I cook breakfast and that tape starts running. I talk to Shari, and that tape starts running. Don’t you think I would stop them if I could? God, oh, please, why are you so damn nice to me? God! Don’t you understand what I’m trying to say to you? Maybe it’ll be better if he just... didn’t come back at all. [EXHALES] I don’t understand how you can just take it. I can’t. All right? I can’t. I thought that if I was there for you when you need me, it would help you. I guess I thought that if you knew I was there, it’d make up for some of the rejection that you felt, some of the whatever. But it doesn’t. You’re a bottomless pit of it. I guess whatever Steve was to you, that’s all that really matters. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CLEARS THROAT] Became a way of life, looking for Steve, worrying about him. Hasn’t it? That’s 132! I’m going out. Where the hell are you going? Who cares? ALAN: We care. When Steve was here, that’s the only thing you were interested in. Now the only thing you care about is that he’s missing. [SIRENS WAILING] [INAUDIBLE] [COUGHS] ALAN: Just wondering if we’re going over the same territory. [EXHALES] What difference does that make? So what? Talked to the police. Nothing. Found out from Craig where this kid, Dan, lives. His own parents haven’t even seen him for a couple of weeks. I can’t believe some people. I mean, why don’t... [SIGHS] I thought I saw him today. Bunch of kids. I never realized there was so many of them. Almost like ghosts. STEVE: It’s a fact, Jack. It’s not a perfect world. I mean, some people... some people look at me. I am beautiful. I am perfect in every way. I mean, I know it’s hard, but what are you gonna do? SHARI: Oh, my God. [LAUGHS] STEVE: Let’s go. RANDI: You kids have a good time. SHARI: Bye. RANDI: Be careful. [DOOR CLOSES] ALAN: I want you to draw something. I can’t draw, if you ever noticed. Okay. You wanna tell me? What? Whatever. What’s bothering you? [SCOFFS] Old news, Dad. Who cares? If you’re gonna be so long, I’ll just hitch home. Damn it, Shari. I am sorry as hell that things have been so tough on you, but how many times do I have to tell you that? None. No times. You don’t have to tell me that any time. You and Mom just do that so you can feel better. Hey, that’s fine, but don’t expect me to be little Miss Perfect so Randi and Alan can think they’re good parents. Don’t you talk to me that way. Parents aren’t perfect. Sometimes we don’t know what the hell we’re doing either. I look at you sometimes and I think "What happened to my little girl?" Look at your hair, your makeup. Sometimes I think I’m gonna wake up in the morning, you’ll have shaved your head. Yeah, you can laugh, but I really think that sometimes. Well... if it’s of any consolation, I’m not on drugs yet. I’m leaving. All my life, I thought... when I’d have something to say about it, when I can do something about it, I would damn well have a family, you know. Everybody together, everybody... [SIGHS] I told Steve this thing that... my father told me one time. "It’s a great piece of advice handed down from father to son," he said. "Make sure you get a job where you don’t get your hands dirty." [SIGHS] He didn’t know what that meant. [SIGHS] I don’t think I do either. [GIRL SOBBING] [GIRL CRYING] Hey, Steve. You okay? I want to go home. That’s cool. Sometimes I wish I could. Why can’t you just go home? Just can’t. Don’t know exactly. I mean, at first you leave ’cause it's such a drag. Then you just kinda can’t go back. I can’t stand the sight of them. They can’t stand the sight of me. You, you’re different trip. Who knows, maybe you can get past that. Go back, all that. Look, if you wanna hang, it’s cool. We’ll take you if you want, whatever. Hey, Steve. You’re cool, man. Don’t let anybody tell you different. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] I love you. I just hope I’m not a bottomless pit. Me too. [DOOR OPENS] Hi. Steve. [DOOR CLOSES] Honey, can I get you something? Hungry? I remember this house. You should. I should. Hi. Hi. My sister. Shari. My brother. Steve. Steve! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How could you do this? How could you do this? How could you do this? Stop it, Steve! Stop it! Stop it, Steve! No! Stop it! Steve! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! This is not my stuff. This is not my stuff. It’s his. It’s his stuff. This is my room. Not his. It’s mine. It’s my room. I... I want this room. I... I want... I... I want... a sister. Father. [SNIFFS] And Mom. I want you to be my mom. I need you... not his. I... I need it. I’m gonna need some help picking some of the stuff up. You’re my kid. All right? You’re my son. You can count on it. You can count on it. [PATTING] Until the end. Steve, I can’t forget him but... it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. I don’t know you very well. But I know that I love you. And I wanna be your mom. Yours. When you went away and... I thought that I had lost you, I couldn’t stand it. Not seeing you... Not knowing if you were safe or not. Like a mom. Like your mom, okay? Who wants to remember all this junk anyway. Like, who’d you beat to win this? I believe my friend, Craig. ALAN: Well, it’s gonna give some future archaeologist some kind of puzzle. We should always remember our first Steve. He was a great kid, a wonderful son. Sometimes, a pain in the butt. ALAN: Sometimes, a pain in the butt. Like me. Yeah, you got that for sure. What really makes me sad is just what you’ve missed. What we’ve had. Our experiences, our memories, with the old Steve. Growing up with him, living with him. And all the feelings, the discoveries of childhood. We’ll have to help him build those again. No matter how much we love you, we just have to try to find a way to... love you more. [SERENE MUSIC PLAYING]
