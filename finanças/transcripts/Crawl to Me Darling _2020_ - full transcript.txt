Yes fuck, open the door. Get the fuck away from me or I'm calling the police. Which service? Police please. Are you able to talk? Yes. What's your current address? It's 57 Glenn Close. What's your emergency? Um, I went on a date with this guy and he made me eat cake and now he followed me home and he just tried to stop me from getting in my house. He made you eat cake on the date? Where are you now miss? In my house. Okay and where is he? - I think he's going. Are you in any danger? No, I'm just a bit shaken up. Would you like us to send a policeman? No, not really. Do you need emergency services, ma'am? No. Well okay, but this line is reserved for emergencies only. If you don't have- I know, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have, sorry. Your body is going through a shock. You need to rest for awhile. Your body will get strength back. - What are you doing? What's going on? What's going on? Let me go! You need to drink. It's only water. You need to calm down. I'm not going to hurt you. Your body is going through shock. You need to rest for awhile. You need to listen to me, Millie. I had to do this for us. I had no choice. This will be the best thing that has ever happened to you. You just need to trust me. - What the fuck? What are you? Stop! What do you want? Smile. - What? Good morning darling. - What the fuck? Good morning darling. What do you want me to Good morning darling. Good morning, darling. How are you today? - Fantastic, darling. I'm hungry. What's for breakfast? - I don't know. A slice of brown toast, a boiled egg, a mug of coffee and a pear. Good morning darling. - Good morning darling Good morning darling. How are you today? - Fantastic, darling. How are you? I'm hungry. What's for breakfast? - A brown slice of toast, an egg boiled, a cup of coffee and a pear. Correct. - What's gonna happen to me? What's gonna happen to me? Finish your food. Let it happen. Don't fight this, Millie. I don't want this to keep happening. I want things to be easy for us. They can be easy for us. Do you remember? Do you remember, Millie? In the field? And we never wanted it to end. Good morning darling. I don't want to do this. You need to listen to me. You need to start doing as I ask because I don't want to keep hurting you. We need to trust one another. Let's try this again. Good morning, darling. - Good morning, darling. Thank you for breakfast. Thank you for cutting me free. Use your fork. I don't want you biting your fingers. Don't rush. - I'm sorry. What do you want? You don't have to do that. Good morning, darling. I don't believe you. - What the fuck do you want? I need you to behave. - I'm sorry. You know, I kind of like being tied up. Which dress, black or yellow? - Black, just leave it on the bed. Let's get you dressed. Millie! Millie! Millie, you can't run from this. Millie! It's okay, it's okay. Millie, shhh, I'm trying to help you. - What the fuck have you done to me? - It's a side effect of the drugs, Millie, it's a loss of strength, a loss of coordination. I want to stop giving them to you but you have to start listening. - What do you want? You want to fuck me, then fuck me. If you want to kill me, just end it, just fucking do it now. - Millie, Millie, there's so much more than that. Millie, I want you, I want all of you. But you have to start listening to what I say. It will be so much easier. - You should listen to yourself. Don't you think it's a bit late for that? - Millie, I'm gonna have to hurt you now. I am so sorry. I don't want to hurt you but I have to. You're going to wake up every day from a nightmare covered in sweat but it won't be my face that you see. The mask is more important than you think. Bite this. I don't want you chewing through your tongue again. This is going to hurt, Millie. But this is our last chance. I'm trying to help you. Wait. You're going to be so happy but you just have to let me in. Why are you making me do this, Millie? It shouldn't have to be this way. It should be easy, Millie. Stop making me do this. Stop making me hurt you. This is your fault, Millie. You're making this more difficult than it ever needed to be. - You're awake, good. Millie, can you hear me? Yeah? Millie, Millie talk to me. I managed to break the lock on the door, okay, you're out now, you're safe. - Who are you? - I'm your friend. Can you walk? Millie, can you walk? Come on up, use me. Millie look at me, okay it's just one straight road. All right, you need to just go straight down there. - What happened? - We've gone for a while yet. Now's your chance to leave? - I can't. - Yes you can. - I can't. - Yes you can. - I can't run from this. - You can, yes you can. Yes, you can. - I can't leave him. - What did you say? - I don't want to go. - It worked. - She just left me there. I had no idea where I was and I wasn't gonna follow her. I looked around for a road or a sign but I couldn't find any. And then I followed the tracks back to the house. - But you were gone for hours? - It's okay, I liked the walk. - And you still came back all by yourself. - I was testing her. You did it, well done. - You were testing her? How were you testing her? - To see if she'd run. - Do you think she was testing you? - No. - You could've ruined everything. - She's already done that. - But anything could have happened to her. - No, there's no way she would have left. The grounds are far too big. It just wouldn't have worked, you know that. - Give me the ring. - What? You don't mean that. - Give me the ring. Give me the ring. - Please, please you don't mean this. No, no you don't mean it you don't mean it. Stop please stop. Please look. Millie, I want you to marry me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Millie, you now have free reign of the house. I will get you your list of duties. Our wedding is set for two days. Make sure you're ready. You have two days to alter your dress to fit Millie and then I'll decide what to do with you. Dear Millie, my requests are as follows. At six a.m., I want you up and out of bed. At 6:30, you should be dressed and presentable for the day. You will serve breakfast after my shower consisting of a slice of brown toast, a boiled egg, a cup of black coffee and a pear by seven o'clock sharp. Then you are to attend to the household. You are to clean the main bathroom twice a day. Once after my shower and another at a time that suits you. The kitchen will be spotless at all times, even whilst cooking. I do not ask for much, only to be respected and for our home to be regarded in the same manner. Zoe will be fitting you for your wedding dress and she will also officiate on the day. She is only here on a temporary basis. After the wedding, I will decide on how to dispose of her. But for now, pay no attention to her. Yours faithfully, your darling husband to be. - I came to make some adjustments to the dress and I just found it like this. She doesn't deserve the ring. - It's okay. It's okay, okay calm down, come here, it's okay. When I first saw you, I was speechless. You were the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. So I followed you to your house, to your work. I had to be sure that you were who you said you were. I had to do my research. I spent months planning and thinking what it would be like to have you and when I finally got you I truly believed that it would be perfect. But perhaps I made some mistakes. I am so sorry. Millie, I promise I will never let this happen to you. - I tore up the dress. - You tore up the dress? - I tore up the dress. - Why? - Because it was her dress and it's my wedding day and I don't want to wear her dress on my day. - That's fair. - You can't sleep either? - You should try turning the lights off. Millie, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - No, no it isn't. - It's okay. - Are you okay? Why did you stop him? - I didn't think you deserved it. I think I do. - Why? - For a time he was good to me. We would walk around for hours through the grounds just to find the perfect spot. Just me and him. We would have lunch there and spend the day just doing nothing, nothing at all. We had it all to ourselves and it was just the right place to escape. But I couldn't see past his face. I couldn't sleep without dreaming of him trying to pin me down or him chasing me down through the woods. I couldn't tell them apart anymore. I would wake up covered in sweat terrified of which one was sleeping next to me. His hands that were stroking my hair were the same ones that tied me down, the same ones that shocked me half to death. The same ones that held me and the same ones that loved me. And it tore me apart. I couldn't kill one without killing the other so I chose not to lose either, but it was too late, I lost him anyway. And then he found you. He'll forgive you, you know, but he won't forget. People forget, not him. Millie, can you do me a favor? - Yeah. - Look after him. - Of course, promise. - Is there anything I can do for you? - You can give me some sleep. - I'll leave something behind the mirror for you tomorrow. But take it in small doses. - Thanks. - I'm gonna make you look so pretty tomorrow. I'll make sure of it. I'll turn the light off for you. - Night Zoe. She's not waking up. What did you give her? Just a small bottle. I told her only to take a small dose. An entire bottle? She needed help sleeping. Where did you get it from? The safe. This is it. If she doesn't wake up, then neither will you. - She will. Millie, repeat after me, I take thee to be my wedded husband. - I take thee to be my wedded husband. - To have and to hold from this day forward. - To have and to hold from this day forward. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer. - For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer. In sickness and in health. - In sickness and in health. - To love. - To love. - To cherish. - To cherish. To obey. - To obey. - Till death do us part. - Till death do us part. - You may now kiss the bride. - You're not hungry? Well try it at least. - I'm fine, really. - Zoe made you a cake. The least you can do is try it. - Okay. - How much did you use? How much did you use? - How much of what? - How much did you put in the cake? - I didn't make the cake. I did. - Stop! Stop! Stop. Stop. Please stop. It's okay, it's okay. Talk to me, talk to me. Talk to me, talk to me. Okay. Talk to me, talk to me. Talk to me, talk to me. Talk to me. It's gonna be okay. It's a fucking good cake.
